1
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,660
Welcome.

2
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,000
Hello, hello, welcome, welcome, welcome.

3
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
Howdy doody.

4
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,720
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

5
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,660
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

6
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,440
Thank you.

7
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,980
Hello.

8
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,180
Welcome.

9
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
To Steam Dolls.

10
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,580
Order of Chaos.

11
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,760
Yay!

12
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,620
Oh my goodness.

13
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,420
Guys, I'm so tired.

14
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,580
Okay, for those who watched Lifeline yesterday...

15
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,580
Um, and if anybody's watching this...

16
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,740
A long time from now, yesterday I played Lifeline.

17
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,960
Which is a voice command game from PS2 era.

18
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,320
And I played it for 8 hours and I was very tired at the end.

19
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,240
It was 7 and a half.

20
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,500
And it was a lot of talking.

21
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,140
And it was a lot of brain.

22
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,840
So today I was just like, maybe I don't know much about this game.

23
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,240
I think I'm gonna take it easy.

24
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,240
I'll have something, you know, kind of like...

25
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,000
So, first of all, I'm blocking it.

26
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,680
But this is early access build.

27
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,940
Not that I have early access, but...

28
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,020
Because I'm actually doing the demo.

29
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,140
Because I was just like, well, you know, I'm gonna try it out.

30
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,980
And also, um, I'm so tired today.

31
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,580
So I was like, I'm gonna take it easy after Lifeline.

32
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,940
And then I'm like reading stuff about this game and people are like...

33
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,540
Man, this game is pretty difficult.

34
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,300
It's like...

35
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,940
It's difficult.

36
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
It's like, um, you know...

37
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,860
It's kind of like, you know, higher level of difficulty.

38
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,340
And I was just like...

39
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,760
Oh...

40
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,020
But there's a reason I'm playing this game.

41
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,460
There's a reason I'm playing this game.

42
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:14,460
And it's because it was heavily promoted by and starring David Hayter.

43
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:22,540
As the main character, which if you don't know that name, that is Solid Snake from Metal Gear Solid.

44
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:31,400
And then also, there are other voices in this from Metal Gear, such as Christopher Randolph, which is Otacon.

45
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,040
And also, Jennifer Hale, which is...

46
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,560
I don't know.

47
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
But also, E.E.

48
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,240
So, yeah, it's very star-studded cast.

49
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,000
Star-studded cast.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,020
Star-studded cast.

51
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,430
But honestly, Jennifer Hale, she's such a great voice actress.

52
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,810
What's wrong with E.E.?

53
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,790
But, um, yeah, so I was just like, I'll check it out.

54
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,310
And so that's why I grabbed the demo, which is free.

55
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,190
But I want to say that just in case, like...

56
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:22,010
I don't know if this is like... It does say early access build, but the game is actually out now.

57
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,410
So I'm assuming that the game is the most updated version and that they have probably not updated this.

58
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:35,650
So if there's anything that is a little funky, then that's probably why.

59
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,810
And also, if you're like, why is she playing the demo version?

60
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,090
Um, well, I don't...

61
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,010
How do I explain?

62
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:52,050
If I really love the game, I will, you know, obviously go back and I will play the full version.

63
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,410
But I was kind of like, I just want to, you know, I read that the demo is pretty long.

64
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,730
So I was like, you know, I can at least get a feel for the game without...

65
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,130
Without committing myself to saying that I will complete the game on stream.

66
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,330
Yeah, we're testing the waters.

67
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,790
That's what a demo is for.

68
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,610
That's what a demo is for.

69
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,250
So, yeah, just as like an overall disclaimer.

70
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,050
Yeah.

71
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,250
But, um, I remember when Jennifer Hale was the voice of Gateway 2000 PCs.

72
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,350
At an early job, I heard her voice so often on hold with tech support.

73
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,510
What?

74
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,670
Also, Steven, thank you for the super chat.

75
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,390
Wait, what?

76
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,810
I had no idea.

77
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,470
I got my master's degree!

78
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,270
Master Paladin!

79
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,890
Thank you for getting me through all the down times during the past three years.

80
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,610
Minto, so happy I found you.

81
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,290
Congratulations!

82
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,410
Wow.

83
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,010
Congratulations!

84
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,910
Oh my gosh.

85
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,530
That's awesome.

86
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,110
That's awesome.

87
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,730
That's awesome.

88
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,570
Nice.

89
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,330
Yeah, you're a master.

90
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,770
Sorry, I also meant to say, because I saw someone mention it.

91
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,010
When I say the demo is short, I put that in quotation marks because...

92
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,750
Someone said that someone in a Steam review was like, I got through it in two hours.

93
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,990
It's, you know...

94
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,750
I mean short as in like it's not, you know...

95
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,710
It is still a decent amount of time for a stream.

96
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,430
So I was like, you know what?

97
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,070
That's kind of perfect.

98
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,790
And me, knowing me, I always add like an hour to that.

99
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,030
I wonder how long the full game is then.

100
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,350
Are Steam dolls similar to ghosts?

101
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,110
Because they are made of steam and don't have a corporeal form.

102
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,370
What?

103
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,770
I'm not a doll.

104
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,350
I'm not a doll.

105
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,290
Well, I could possess a doll.

106
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,730
Haunted dolls are like a hot thing.

107
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,070
You can go on eBay and find haunted dolls.

108
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,050
I feel like though...

109
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,230
If I, you know, stop VTubing, I might do that because...

110
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,510
What?

111
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,990
I just...

112
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,150
I just get to sit on a shelf all day?

113
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,310
So easy, right?

114
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,010
It's my birthday!

115
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,390
I was in Japan for my birthday last year, but I'm just old and boring this year.

116
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,010
I mean...

117
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,210
But at least I have Minto and David Hayter.

118
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,970
I don't think Minto is boring, right?

119
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,030
Sorry, I'm not Japan.

120
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,390
Happy birthday!

121
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,250
Wouldn't it be boring to sit there?

122
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,150
As a haunted doll?

123
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,550
Well, I'll... Okay, think of it like this.

124
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,390
You're sitting there.

125
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,590
You get free housing.

126
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,670
I don't have to... I would not have to pay rent or anything.

127
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,290
I would just sit there.

128
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,090
I would have a free show.

129
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:32,470
I would probably try to find, you know, someone that watches a lot of good TV.

130
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,630
And then I would just sit on the shelf and have free television every day.

131
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,590
And then, all I have to do is like...

132
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,090
Tilt my head a little bit.

133
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,210
Wiggle my arm.

134
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,210
Just give them a little bit of a show every once in a while.

135
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,810
And they'd be like...

136
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,270
Wow!

137
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,710
I might even become famous on TikTok.

138
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,810
I mean...

139
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,870
It seems like the easy afterlife.

140
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,330
Elf on the shelf.

141
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,970
But like...

143
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,450
Better.

144
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,610
Darch beans!

145
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,930
Welcome to membership.

146
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,930
Thank you!

147
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,070
So yeah.

148
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,630
Have people in the TikTok comments going fake.

149
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,450
No!

150
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,490
They would believe I'm real.

151
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,050
I'd be so convincing.

152
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,810
Steam dolls.

153
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,810
Is Gabe Newell getting into the doll business?

154
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,110
Yeah.

155
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,210
Steam dolls.

156
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,470
It's so cool.

157
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,250
Steampunk.

158
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,250
I feel like Steampunk is...

159
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,270
Like...

160
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:53,550
I feel it was revived maybe like a decade ago.

161
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,710
And then...

162
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,250
It's kind of a dying...

163
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,670
What's the word?

164
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,430
Style.

165
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,510
I feel as of recently.

166
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,210
Andregos, thanks for the 20 gifted!

167
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,410
Today is my birthday!

168
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,150
Having a slow day, working and watching Yoshi.

169
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,030
Jayth!

170
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,450
Happy birthday to you!

171
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,070
Happy birthday to you!

172
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,990
Happy birthday dear Jayth!

173
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,490
Happy birthday to you!

174
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,470
Happy birthday!

175
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,510
Might be an exhausted style.

176
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,970
I guess it was back in the 2010s, right?

177
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,850
Because it was a lot of places.

178
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,150
There would be Steampunk versions of like every character.

179
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,710
I feel at like conventions, you would see like...

180
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,310
Steampunk Star Wars characters.

181
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,910
Steampunk Batman.

182
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,330
Steampunk, you know?

183
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,630
There's Steampunk everything.

184
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,810
Actually, at the...

185
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:50,930
What's it called?

186
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,970
Tokyo Disney Sea.

187
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,730
Not Disneyland, but Tokyo Disney Sea.

188
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,090
There's an area of the park that is like Steampunk themed.

189
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,090
It's the area with the ride...

190
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,530
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

191
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,090
Oh sorry, that was my controller.

192
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,090
There's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and also...

193
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,670
Journey to the Center of the Earth.

194
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,470
I love Journey to the Center of the Earth.

195
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,990
Me too!

196
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,950
Oh my gosh, it's such a fun ride.

197
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,850
So awesome.

198
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,090
That was my controller disconnecting, but it's okay.

199
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,170
And...

200
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,690
And...

201
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,790
The uniforms they wear in that area are pretty Steampunk.

202
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,730
They're very cute.

203
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,010
So I love going into that area.

204
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,090
I've never been a huge Steampunk person, but...

205
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,790
I can appreciate it, at least.

206
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,590
Steampunk Transformers figures coming out this summer.

207
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:46,990
What?

208
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,110
What?

209
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,230
Is this the perfect time to get into Transformers?

210
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,390
Well, I don't know.

211
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,090
Is there a bad time?

212
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,290
Was there a bad time to get into Transformers?

213
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,130
Was it when the Michael Bay era was at its peak, maybe?

214
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,390
I quickly glanced at my second monitor.

215
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,350
I'm sorry!

216
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,450
Oh, nine months.

217
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,090
Time to take responsibility.

218
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,530
No!

219
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,550
I'll never take responsibility for any of my actions!

220
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,290
But thank you, Echoes.

221
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,170
Welcome back.

222
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,790
And Shallows, welcome back too.

223
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,850
Hello, Minky.

224
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,930
Would I ever play Bioshock?

225
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,150
I've never played Bioshock.

226
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,870
I don't know...

227
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,070
Actually, I don't know any spoilers about Bioshock either.

228
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,110
Is that a good...

229
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,090
I mean, I know it's a beloved series.

230
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,850
Would that be...

231
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,490
Something too...

232
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,070
Perfect?

233
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,470
Would it be something that you guys would be interested in seeing?

234
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,870
No one say anything.

235
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,670
No spoilers!

236
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,490
No spoilers!

237
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,850
I managed to avoid spoilers for so many games and series and stuff because...

238
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,850
I think when, like, I don't know...

239
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,110
I hyperfixate on other stuff, right?

240
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,690
And so I hyperfixated on idols for a very, very long time.

241
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,490
And so I just...

242
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,530
I, like, you know, when someone's just like, how do you not see that on the internet?

243
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,830
How do you not just casually run into spoilers?

244
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,690
It's because I...

245
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,850
I very...

246
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:35,350
Like I said, I hyperfixate and I catered all of my everything that I would see to, like, idols.

247
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,290
For a very long time.

248
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,390
I'm such a mint simp.

249
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,470
My phone's wallpaper is now your Valentine's Day member's gift.

250
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,490
Every time I see a cute pic, I smile and I get so happy.

251
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,450
Thank you, Rodrigo!

252
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,850
Thanks for using it.

253
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,410
I'm glad you liked it.

254
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,470
If you are a member...

255
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:06,330
And you haven't seen the Valentine's Day wallpaper that I uploaded last week...

256
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,170
Check it out!

257
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,250
Speaking of idols, I went to Deer Stage last night!

258
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,790
Who was working?

259
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,030
Wait, I think my Oshi was working last night.

260
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,330
Did you see her?

261
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,350
Hot dog, indeed.

262
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,150
Oh, wait!

263
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,270
Went to Deer Stage yesterday for the first time.

264
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:21,690
It was so cool.

265
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,090
I didn't know any of the calls, but I had fun.

266
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,090
Thanks for the recommendations!

267
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,110
I also went to Jam!

268
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,790
If you happen to see my Twitter post...

269
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,870
Was your Twitter post the one about you going and then saying that...

270
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,110
Another VTuber had recommended it and then they drew on your coaster?

271
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,190
Thank you for joining!

272
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,910
Thank you for joining!

273
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,730
Thank you for joining!

274
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,590
Maybe.

275
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,630
I did see it then.

276
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,550
Anyway!

277
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,490
Shall we get into Steam Dolls?

278
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,570
I think you're gonna hear my...

279
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,870
There's my controller again.

280
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,370
Shall we try Steam Dolls?

281
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,090
I'm excited to hear the cast.

282
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,670
And...

283
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,590
It's gonna be weird.

284
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,410
It's always so weird hearing David Hayter in other games.

285
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,470
Like, there was that one...

286
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:09,950
Oh, gosh.

287
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:16,110
There was another, like, Metroidvania-style game that he was in.

288
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,570
I cannot remember.

289
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,890
But, like, it's always so, like, you're like...

290
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,030
Whoa, that's David Hayter!

291
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,050
Bloodstained!

292
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,190
Yes, I talked about playing it before.

293
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,510
Got the best news today.

294
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,770
My boss approved my four-day trip to Japan!

295
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,670
I'm so excited to get to go to your collab cafe.

296
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,690
Oh, my gosh!

297
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,250
Four days, though!

298
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,910
You're gonna be so jet-lagged.

299
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,250
Oh, unless you're very close.

300
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,390
Have a fun trip!

301
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,010
I like the thigh squish peeking at the edge.

302
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,190
Let's start.

303
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,410
New game.

304
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,910
Let me see how that...

305
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,630
My goodness.

306
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,170
Oh, I have a good feeling about this.

307
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,090
Okay, move.

308
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,570
Jump with A.

309
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,370
Attack with X.

310
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,190
Okay, I have to remember I'm not on a PlayStation controller.

311
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,210
Okay.

312
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,590
Jump, attack.

313
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,930
Raiden?

314
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,370
You can hear him.

315
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,270
Oh, I died.

316
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,930
Can I make it this way?

317
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,350
Nope.

318
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,970
Okay, they only want me to go this way.

319
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,870
Where am I going?

320
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,590
Nobody knows.

321
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,730
Oh, that's fire.

322
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,610
Avoid.

323
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,050
Can I double jump?

324
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,570
I cannot.

325
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,430
What the hell?

326
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,630
Did I get hurt?

327
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,690
Did I fall into the void?

328
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,910
What happened to the steampunk?

329
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,590
Suddenly it's so fleshy.

330
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,150
Oh, there's creatures coming at me.

331
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,930
Oh, my gosh.

332
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,010
Oh, my god.

333
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,330
Oh, my god.

334
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,690
I was just tapping them.

335
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,630
I wasn't even...

336
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,270
Oh, my god!

337
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,510
I wasn't even doing anything.

338
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,370
I just ran.

339
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,410
Again, this isn't...

340
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,450
Is that Christopher Randolph?

341
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,370
What are you doing?

342
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,010
Oh, so we were overpowered I think.

343
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,990
This is my tale.

344
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,770
I am the one recounting it.

345
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:41,890
I think it is.

346
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,950
Which, of course, means we are doing things my way.

347
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,230
Now, I should mention...

348
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,250
I am particularly fond of tutorials.

349
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,650
Tutorials.

350
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,030
So...

351
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,430
Oh, sorry.

352
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:54,930
Oh, my gosh.

353
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,490
I forgot that when I clicked out of the game.

354
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:57,950
Naturally.

355
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,570
I was moving myself.

356
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,890
We shall have to endure one now.

357
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,450
Okay.

358
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,350
To get it out of the way.

359
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,950
He's so dapper.

360
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,950
As for the journey ahead...

361
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,890
It could be sad.

362
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,690
Tutorial.

363
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,610
Or perhaps a bit humorous.

364
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,290
Or, frankly, it might turn out to be downright preposterous at times.

365
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,070
Life has a peculiar way of being all of those things at once.

366
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,210
Would you not agree?

367
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,170
I like the static noise.

368
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,850
It's kind of creepy.

369
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,550
Tutorial.

370
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,870
Oh.

371
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,730
Verifying installation.

372
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,130
Attempting reparation of the main database.

373
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,530
Success.

374
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,690
Utopic API.

375
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,130
Under the watchful eye.

376
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,630
100% done.

377
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,050
Run app build tutorial new version query.

378
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,650
Vault over obstacles with A.

379
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,430
Look at me.

380
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,790
I'm in the VR missions.

381
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,610
Okay.

382
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,890
Okay.

383
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,070
Excellent, Snake.

384
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,690
Evade with R.T.

385
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,310
Oh my gosh.

386
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,470
I actually killed it.

387
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,990
Blasting foes will grant you blue spheres.

388
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,350
Look for them to re...

389
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,550
Wait, what do you mean blasting?

390
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,940
Oh.

391
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,120
While you were still press...

392
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,900
What is that?

393
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:39,900
Huh?

394
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,260
Blorbs?

395
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:44,760
What?

396
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,620
What?

397
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,080
Key?

398
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,440
What?

399
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,300
The bumpers?

400
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,860
While you were still press bumper.

401
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,980
Not that one.

402
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,600
Oh.

403
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,940
No, not that one.

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,500
Maybe both?

405
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,240
No.

406
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,560
LB.

407
00:21:59,560 --> 00:21:59,620
LB?

408
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,200
Oh.

409
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:04,740
What?

410
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,060
I don't know what that's doing.

411
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,040
No.

412
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,880
It's the same thing, but...

413
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,000
What?

414
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,060
It's...

415
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,120
It's slightly different.

416
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,360
Huh?

417
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,860
Impressive whisper.

418
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,200
We can cut that.

419
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,700
So he calls us impressive wisp.

420
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,380
Good food from Otacon Daddy.

421
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,480
Wait.

422
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,540
It might be unbound.

423
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,480
Oh no.

424
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,080
Let's see.

425
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,860
Options.

426
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:41,840
Oh.

427
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,020
Can I not go to options?

428
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,140
Oh.

429
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,000
Maybe...

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,300
No.

431
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,350
Oh, that's zoom.

432
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,770
Move.

433
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,510
But also D-pad is also move.

434
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,990
Wait, I...

435
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,190
Oh.

436
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,830
Huh.

437
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,630
Yeah, this is an early build everyone.

438
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,470
If you didn't see the very beginning.

439
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,230
I'll just kill him.

440
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,830
Sorry, I feel like the audio balancing is a little off.

441
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,990
Right after attacking, maintain X to charge a super attack.

442
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,270
Yeah.

443
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,130
Sorry if it's a little loud.

444
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,130
Huh.

445
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,130
Try bumpers?

446
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,550
I tried everything you guys.

447
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
Nothing is working.

448
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,590
Hold LT to...

449
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,670
Oh, that's what that is.

450
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,330
A snake.

451
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,830
Oh my god.

452
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,790
When the skull is visible, assassinate them with RB.

453
00:23:59,550 --> 00:23:59,950
What?

454
00:23:59,950 --> 00:23:59,970
What?

455
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,510
RB.

456
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,590
I'll just keep turning it down.

457
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,910
Sorry, you can't hear the...

458
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,110
Oh wait.

459
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,890
If an enemy detects you, they will become way harder to kill and will trigger a global alarm.

460
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,170
Excuse me.

461
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:18,790
Wee woo.

462
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:25,940
Shoot.

463
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,150
I killed him.

464
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:40,810
I think the attack sounds are very loud, but the actual gaming sound is not so loud.

465
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,190
Global alarm prevents you from sneaking up behind enemies.

466
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,150
Your scrambler...

467
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,470
shuts it off.

468
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,910
Depletes the blue power gauge.

469
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,650
Is that what that is?

470
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,490
Okay.

471
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,330
Interesting.

472
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,830
Okay.

473
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,610
Focus.

474
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:00,750
Wait.

475
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,070
Enable focus to get useful...

476
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,810
Oh, enemies or traps with a pulsing circle can trigger the global alarm.

477
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,370
Not all of them have this ability.

478
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,730
Be wary around the ones who do.

479
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,990
Okay.

480
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,330
Interesting.

481
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,170
And then it's RB.

482
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,460
Where is...

483
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,200
Let me kill him.

484
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
Oh, I'm so good.

485
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
What is that?

486
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,680
Oh, what the...

487
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,800
Use focus to follow the power lines effectively.

488
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,920
If a power line is interrupted, a wireless glyph can get you to the corresponding power line.

489
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,140
Why do I need to go to the power line?

490
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,680
What is that?

491
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,920
More than one power line?

492
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,640
Looks like the...

493
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,080
Wait.

494
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,380
Look at the wireless glyph and its letter to find the corresponding power line.

495
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,820
Oh.

496
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,260
A.

497
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,100
B.

498
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,280
A.

499
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,100
B.

500
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,560
Oh, I did it.

501
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,320
Thank you.

502
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,220
If you are low on health, heal with B.

503
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,520
Heal is a sub-weapon.

504
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,890
Collect sub-weapons by exploring.

505
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,000
Alright, I'm exploring.

506
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,420
Oh.

507
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,840
Okay, so we focus.

508
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,460
He does not have a thingy.

509
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,680
Gotta sneak up on him.

510
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,650
He was looking straight at me, but I still killed him.

511
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,490
Oh.

512
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,150
Destroy containers to get blue spheres or money!

513
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,570
What do we need money for?

514
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:48,810
Okay.

515
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,330
Pause the game to look at your map.

516
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:53,970
I did that.

517
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,790
Wait, what's down here?

518
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:58,990
Crouch?

519
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,030
Press A.

520
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,490
Okay, that's pretty standard.

521
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,510
You seem ready.

522
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,510
Shall we begin?

523
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,050
Okay.

524
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,110
Oh, oh.

525
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,630
The illusion of choice.

526
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,070
I'll do the second yes.

527
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,130
Yes?

528
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,970
Yes.

529
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,210
Excellent.

530
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:20,910
Okay.

531
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,250
I wonder who Jennifer Hale voice is then.

532
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,110
Oh, cutscene?

533
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,610
Every civilization has an expiration date.

534
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:38,890
After the Great Collapse, society was born anew in fear and loathing.

535
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,230
It was time for a change, but it never came.

536
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,230
It's different, I like it.

537
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,130
It's not the same.

538
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,990
Reprieve descended from the stars.

539
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,670
The discovery of a new power source to ensure the cycle never broke.

540
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,510
Boy, that's changed.

541
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,990
Humanity had once again failed to learn from its past.

542
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,690
But this time around, the most amusing thing happened.

543
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,330
The tumors of society began to spread in the flesh.

544
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,590
Despair coursing through their veins.

545
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,030
It becomes more and more.

546
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,050
Salvation will come from a different breed of evil.

547
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,870
Nothing will shatter my determination.

548
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,910
Whispering chaos and destruction as they sink into oblivion.

549
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,250
I don't know the story of this at all, but...

550
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,390
It's kinda cool.

551
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,200
Alright.

552
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,720
Much edge.

553
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Very edgy.

554
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,960
We got our little blades too.

555
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,540
That was a nice speech.

556
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,120
Very moving.

557
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,920
Thank you.

558
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,200
It's like a weird Metal Gear where everyone's just a little bit off.

559
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,140
Everyone sounds just a little bit different.

560
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,860
He was listening to that?

561
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,300
That wasn't an inner monologue?

562
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,320
We were speaking that out loud?

563
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,200
Always listening.

564
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,980
Always yapping.

565
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,910
Please, someone...

566
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,790
Someone put that to Snake, please.

567
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,490
I need to know Solid Snake saying yapping.

568
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,130
I can't.

569
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,790
I can't.

570
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,230
It's so good.

571
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,810
My doll that looks like you arrived.

572
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,750
The Doremi one.

573
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,350
Oh!

574
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,010
Wow!

575
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,950
I actually still... I have it... Actually, the tab's still open.

576
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,350
But I haven't ordered one yet.

577
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,910
I was just looking at it earlier today.

578
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,650
I was like, I want to get the blind box but I'm scared of not getting it.

579
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,430
He's a yapper.

580
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,190
He's a yapper.

581
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,450
That doesn't sound like...

582
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,970
Like that doesn't sound like David Hayter to me.

583
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,150
Or does it sound... Am I crazy?

584
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,790
It does sound like someone else.

585
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,390
I don't know.

586
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,010
I hear something over here.

587
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,670
It's loud.

588
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:28,730
They're drilling.

589
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,890
I like the setting a lot.

590
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,070
I guess we'll get there eventually.

591
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,170
What's that?

592
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,580
Oh shoot!

593
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,960
Sorry.

594
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,840
Oh my god!

595
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,020
Oh my god, these tanky men!

596
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,820
Ouch!

597
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,700
I died!

598
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,760
Oh my god!

599
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,720
How hard does he hit?

600
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,300
He needs more...

601
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,580
He's so beefy!

602
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,120
I took three hits and died.

603
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,750
Am I the worst assassin in the world maybe?

604
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,360
Don't see me.

605
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,400
Oh shit!

606
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,120
Come here.

607
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,780
And it said B to heal.

608
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,300
I see, I see.

609
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:37,580
Okay.

610
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,820
I wasted it kind of, but that's okay.

611
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,680
I was gonna sneak up on him.

612
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,020
Guy's got ears.

613
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,840
What is... What in the...

614
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,400
What in the... What was that sound?

615
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:53,900
What is this?

616
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,440
I got his ass!

617
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,820
Oh, we have the warning though.

618
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Now we don't.

619
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,340
Wait, but he didn't have...

620
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,220
Oh, I don't think I looked in the right mode.

621
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,260
I looked in sneaking mode, then normal mode to see if he would alert everybody in the world.

622
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,140
I see, I see.

623
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,920
My bad.

624
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,060
Alright.

625
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,090
We look like grey fox a little bit.

626
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,290
That looks like a genome soldier, just straight up.

627
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:36,970
Excuse me?

628
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,090
And they have...

629
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,350
I don't wanna fight guns.

630
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:40,790
I'm just...

631
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,910
What the hell is that?

632
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,850
What the hell is that?

633
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,090
Oh my god!

634
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,730
The ladder animation is too funny.

635
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,710
Okay.

636
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,150
What?

637
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:02,790
That...

638
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,650
Oh gosh, okay.

639
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,330
Angry Roomba.

640
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,130
Dylan, welcome to membership.

641
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,070
Thank you!

642
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,070
Wait, I'm trying to charge, but...

643
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,010
Oh, I broke it.

644
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,190
I don't wanna...

645
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,470
Let me test something.

646
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,650
Okay, I can run past it.

647
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,850
Angry Roomba.

648
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,790
That guy will sound the alarms.

649
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:37,850
Alarms.

650
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,160
I forgot about my free super chat.

651
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,640
Thank you for the free super chat.

652
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,040
Thanks for 8 months.

653
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,820
Are you kidding me?

654
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,120
You didn't hear me.

655
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,120
How did you know?

656
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,120
How am I supposed to sneak up on the guards?

657
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,570
Get your ass beat.

658
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,570
Get your ass beat.

659
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,330
Maybe here, as I go down.

660
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:22,990
Okay.

661
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,350
Giving us all the little...

662
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,010
Wait.

663
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,670
These are things I can destroy.

664
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,030
I forgot.

665
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,110
There's...

666
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,250
I don't think I've seen anything else though that we can beat up.

667
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,590
Alright, we continue onward.

668
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,830
Sneak mode is something you can hold.

669
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,190
Yeah, that's actually how you do it, is you hold the left trigger.

670
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,210
Wow, that used up so much blue.

671
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:48,490
Lame.

672
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,660
I'm hearing a heartbeat.

673
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,280
You guys hear that?

674
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,820
That thing maybe?

675
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,460
Up?

676
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,300
Down.

677
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:11,400
Down.

678
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,980
Oh, game saved!

679
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,440
Got it.

680
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,920
Is that a wanted sign for me?

681
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,040
Sneakiest ghostman to ever sneak.

682
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,960
Oh my gosh.

683
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,260
It scares the heck out of me.

684
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,460
I'm destroying this family's home.

685
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh.

686
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,160
Enable focus on glowing objects by pressing LB to hack devices.

687
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,300
What?

688
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,180
I'm hacking?

689
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,580
I'm hacking this chair?

690
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,860
Okay, I'm in.

691
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,660
Something doesn't add up.

692
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,680
Experiments!

693
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:18,940
Okay.

694
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,260
Nice.

695
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,830
There was... there's that door over there.

696
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,770
How... I wonder if the enemies respawn.

697
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,330
I guess we'll...

698
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,330
I guess we'll find out if they do or not.

699
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

700
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,960
And they do.

701
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,480
Alright.

702
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,480
There was like...

703
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,940
It was like down here.

704
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,460
How is... wait.

705
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,160
Unless hacking opened that door.

706
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,780
Let's go see.

707
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,900
If you exercise...

708
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,060
If you can exercise a chair, you can hack it, Minto.

709
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,020
Oh,

710
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,110
it did open this time.

711
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,690
Oh, sorry.

712
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,070
My big old head is blocking it.

713
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:08,550
Here, hold on.

714
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,850
I'm gonna move over.

715
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,610
I'm gonna...

716
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,250
I'm gonna...

717
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,570
Here, I'll put my...

718
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,230
Oh, there we go.

719
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,650
I'll like be a little bit off...

720
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,770
Off the edge.

721
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,150
Okay.

722
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,650
Yeah.

723
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,870
I'm like constantly adjusting the audio.

724
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,970
My big old head.

725
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,350
Oh.

726
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,330
Music.

727
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,250
Ambience.

728
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,410
What's going on?

729
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,250
Oh.

730
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,610
Whoa.

731
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,210
Okay.

732
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,590
That thing is moving a little.

733
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,630
It's like chugging along.

734
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,530
I think it's struggling a little bit.

735
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,730
Okay, that guy will alert everything.

736
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,550
Oh my gosh.

737
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,850
Wait.

738
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,390
Oh, shoot.

739
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,030
No, no.

740
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,030
Hold on.

741
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,590
I'll wait for him to turn around.

742
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,570
Or come back.

743
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,570
Or do something.

744
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,410
Hello, sir?

745
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,310
Sir?

746
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,720
Oh.

747
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh, I have a...

748
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,100
Chugging.

749
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,000
Chugging plus struggling.

750
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,220
I...

751
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,060
I just...

752
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,420
I have no excuse.

753
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,040
I'm gonna get him.

754
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,940
He's dead!

755
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,340
He's dead!

756
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,640
He's de...

757
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,780
Okay.

758
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,860
We're good.

759
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:53,940
We're good.

760
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,400
Nice.

761
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,560
Holy cow.

762
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,320
Can I get two birds with one stone?

763
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,280
Nope.

764
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,220
Ouch!

765
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,640
Ouch!

766
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,560
Ouch!

767
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Stop it!

768
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,260
I'm so glad this guy is deaf down there.

769
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,800
Is there anything up here?

770
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,020
Oh, just another guy.

771
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,620
Will I be able to sneak up on him?

772
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,580
Oh, shit.

773
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,100
Why do you have ears?

774
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,820
Sometimes.

775
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,760
Oh my god, I'm almost dead.

776
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,900
What was it?

777
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,160
B?

778
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,060
Okay.

779
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,000
The staff lounge closed before I could get lunch.

780
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,340
What?

781
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,820
No!

782
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,500
Slim!

783
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,800
Welcome to Mambushu!

784
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,240
Why does your name sound like an actual Metal Gear character?

785
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,500
Slim Thick Man.

786
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,120
Metal Gear ass name.

787
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,060
It's a reference, it is?

788
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,900
Come here, PNG!

789
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,020
Ouch!

790
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
I get hit by this thing every time.

791
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,770
Oh, okay.

792
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,950
We got it this time.

793
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,010
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

794
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,210
Alright, alright.

795
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,850
We're making our way down.

796
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,890
We're getting money.

797
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,430
Oh, this guy's got a pole spear!

798
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,590
You see him up there?

799
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,550
Oh no.

800
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,090
Okay, this guy I feel...

801
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,190
No, he can't!

802
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:57,510
Damn it!

803
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,430
I'm about to die!

804
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,560
Yeah, come and get me.

805
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,060
BB!

806
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,820
Welcome to Mambushu!

807
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,760
Thank you!

808
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,840
Stupid!

809
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,530
Think smarter, not harder.

810
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,410
Yeah, me!

811
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,750
Welcome to Mambushu!

812
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,290
Thank you!

813
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,290
Thanks guys for all the people joining membership.

814
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,510
I really appreciate it.

815
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,810
Anything down here?

816
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,010
Oh wait, this is where we started from.

817
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:43,910
Just kidding.

818
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,050
Thank you for the gift!

819
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,190
Thank you!

820
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,210
Oh, that's right.

821
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,850
We gotta go up.

822
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,570
I don't think I had to kill that guy.

823
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,790
And I did anyway.

824
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,870
I don't think I had to kill that guy.

825
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,890
I can either heal or disable the thing.

826
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,250
You know what?

827
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:09,950
Let's just...

828
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,850
I never expected to see anyone playing this game.

829
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,510
I like to play different stuff sometimes.

830
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,870
It's my birthday today!

831
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,690
I turned 30!

832
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,830
So I got laid off from...

833
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:19,990
No!

834
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,290
They did not lay you off on your birthday!

835
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,410
Oh look!

836
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,870
LB and RB work now!

837
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,290
Hold on.

838
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,210
Let's see.

839
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:26,650
Audio.

840
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,130
Let's do sound audio.

841
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,390
That should be better.

842
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,470
I'll even do master volume down just a little bit.

843
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,170
No!

844
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,030
That's so evil!

845
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,230
How do I say your name?

846
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,390
Pie chest?

847
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,310
Pie chest?

848
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,710
That's so mean!

849
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,870
That's so mean!

850
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,190
That's so evil!

851
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:10,370
I hope whoever fired you forgets to put the seat back down and they fall into the toilet.

852
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,950
That's happened to me before.

853
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,550
I was staying at my grandma and grandpa's place and I had to go pee in the middle of the night.

854
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,950
And my grandpa didn't put the seat back down and I fell in the toilet.

855
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,090
And I didn't notice because I was half asleep.

856
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,080
Is that how you died?

857
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,500
No!

858
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,840
Yeah.

859
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,840
It's a tough afterlife.

860
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,220
Anyway.

861
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,280
Happy birthday to you!

862
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,080
Happy birthday to you!

863
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,460
Happy birthday and screw your old workplace!

864
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,980
Happy birthday to you!

865
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,340
Happy birthday pie chest!

866
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,060
Have I said your name right?

867
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,480
I hope so.

868
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:04,940
Anyway.

869
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,220
Back.

870
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:07,640
Ok.

871
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,840
I'm going to heal.

872
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,620
Oh B?

873
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,600
I don't have enough to heal.

874
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,520
YOLO!

875
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,490
Oh shoot.

876
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,830
I thought I was going down.

877
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,670
Oh shit!

878
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,190
Oh shit!

879
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,890
Oh shit!

880
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,830
Oh shit!

881
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,710
We lived!

882
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,940
Everything is out to get me.

883
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,600
Nothing is safe.

884
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,060
Well I opened that door.

885
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,040
That's nice.

886
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,920
What's this?

887
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,960
I'm trying to go down.

888
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:52,340
Thank you.

889
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,720
Oh my god.

890
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,160
There is a guy here.

891
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,540
Can he see me behind... Ok.

892
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,340
Let's just... Wait.

893
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,580
Oh no, no.

894
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,180
There is another thing.

895
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,540
I don't know what I just did but...

896
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:04,900
Wait!

897
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,920
There is like literally a sign that's like...

898
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,240
By the way, human trap!

899
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,240
I still can't heal so we are going to...

900
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,340
We are just going to go for it I suppose.

901
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,180
He heard me jump?

902
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:20,840
What is this?

903
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,960
I wish I had a ranged weapon.

904
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:25,800
Like anything.

905
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,500
How am I supposed to...

906
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,680
I died.

907
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,140
I died.

908
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,620
No!

909
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,500
Oh, ok.

910
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,580
Can't aim up.

911
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,880
What a dummy guy, huh?

912
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,720
How is that for the sound though?

913
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,640
Does that sound better?

914
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:08,880
Than before?

915
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,220
Does it sound more ok?

916
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,260
Ok.

917
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,400
Must be a gamer.

918
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,410
We are going to kill this guy.

919
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,310
We did it before.

920
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,800
Oh, shit.

921
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,820
I did the wrong button.

922
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,240
No!

923
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,120
Well, it's ok.

924
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,900
We didn't need the health.

925
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,750
We didn't need the health.

926
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,750
Hi Bito.

927
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,930
Does this game contain metal gears?

928
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,930
Oh, actually.

929
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:47,130
Actually.

930
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,420
Oh my gosh!

931
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:56,920
It did explode!

932
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,220
It didn't explode!

933
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:58,800
Just kidding.

934
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,220
Oh my god, I thought it did.

935
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,380
I thought it exploded it.

936
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,300
Oh, man.

937
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:12,240
Maybe if I jump in sneaky mode it will be better, you know?

938
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,940
So let's try it.

939
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,440
Ok, so that seems to be it.

940
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,580
I have to jump.

941
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,460
I have to perform the action in sneaky mode.

942
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,980
To ensure proper sneak.

943
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,300
Alright.

944
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,040
We are learning.

945
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:36,720
We are learning.

946
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,380
Oh no!

947
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,680
I forgot to open the wall.

948
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,400
I can't get back up.

949
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,420
Well, shoot.

950
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,860
So we will wait for this guy and we will try it again.

951
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,960
Activate your sneak jumps.

952
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,460
Come here.

953
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:58,920
Come here.

954
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,740
Come here.

955
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,760
Come here.

956
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,840
Yeah, if only I had a wall jump.

957
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,440
I'm assuming we get money, so I'm assuming we can pay for like...

958
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,460
extra abilities and stuff in the future and other weapons and everything.

959
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
Oh, yeah.

960
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,300
Yeah.

961
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,760
Yeah.

962
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:18,960
Yeah.

963
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,040
Enable focus.

964
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,240
Ok.

965
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:28,920
Oh, wait.

966
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,840
Oh, this was connected to...

967
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,880
Was I supposed to be on that?

968
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,160
It will come back down, right?

969
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,500
There it is.

970
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:44,760
Ok.

971
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,000
And let's go up.

972
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,780
Ok.

973
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,320
Ok.

974
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,540
Ok.

975
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,240
Very cool.

976
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,060
LB.

977
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,660
Are these attached to nothing?

978
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:56,740
Nevermind.

979
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,080
Whisper is so cold.

980
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,200
Oh my god.

981
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,140
Is there fall damage in this?

982
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,800
Doesn't seem to be.

983
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,640
That guy was in my way.

984
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,280
That was so cold.

985
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:27,800
Yeah.

986
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,580
Very suspicious.

987
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,540
Yeah.

988
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,460
Why is this game got a sense of humor?

989
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,640
What is this?

990
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,060
I can't tell the...

991
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,920
The vibe of this game is so funny.

992
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,820
I can't tell if it's supposed to be so serious or not.

993
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,020
You know?

994
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,740
What does this do?

995
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,020
Nothing apparently.

996
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,900
Can't turn it on or off.

997
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,640
It's a good cheat...

998
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,700
Oh my god!

999
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,860
There's dead people in here!

1000
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,040
What the hell is that sound?

1001
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,380
What is it?

1002
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,580
I'm gonna turn it up just a little bit.

1003
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:14,800
Sorry.

1004
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,240
Also look, we can get serious.

1005
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh yeah, see?

1006
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,900
We can add abilities and secondary weapons and stuff.

1007
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,200
Wow.

1008
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,160
It looks like he looks like Slade from...

1009
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,280
From Teen Titans.

1010
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,160
Aki!

1011
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,180
Welcome to membership!

1012
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,960
We're not gonna comment on this?

1013
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,200
No?

1014
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:35,680
OK.

1015
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,780
I'm afraid of what's going on over here.

1016
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,080
What the hell is that sound?

1017
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:56,520
OK.

1018
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,100
Oh, it's this guy again.

1019
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,160
We'll make sure he doesn't hear us.

1020
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,440
Oh, maybe I'm too slow.

1021
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,700
Oh gosh, I think I'm too slow.

1022
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:09,980
Alright, hold on.

1023
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,880
We'll wait for him to come back.

1024
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,080
Nevermind.

1025
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,240
I could've gotten him.

1026
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,060
Shoot!

1027
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,340
You missed a hundred... Oh wait, this is a LB.

1028
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,380
Whoa!

1029
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,660
There was a ghost!

1030
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,680
I'm hacking?

1031
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,060
Hack?

1032
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,520
Wait, what was the button to hack?

1033
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,940
Hack.

1034
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,980
What's going on here?

1035
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,660
Why is there a ghost in front of the door?

1036
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,620
There's a lot of noise going on in there.

1037
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,840
I don't think I like it.

1038
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,160
The eye.

1039
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,660
This room in particular looks very...

1040
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,660
Oh sh...

1041
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,440
Ouch.

1042
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,620
I was going to say very Castlevania inspired.

1043
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,160
No!

1044
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,220
Dammit!

1045
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:01,990
Game's haunted.

1046
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:07,210
OK.

1047
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:08,330
Oh my god!

1048
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,010
There's two of them!

1049
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,520
Yeah, come here!

1050
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,700
Wait, sorry.

1051
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,720
It was so loud again.

1052
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,460
Sorry, I know I keep adjusting the audio.

1053
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,540
I'm just trying to make sure we get it...

1054
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,800
Maybe... I wonder if sound also includes voice.

1055
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,080
No, that's so lame.

1056
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,660
Alright, I'll just...

1057
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,440
Anyway.

1058
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,260
That's better.

1059
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,480
Oh shoot.

1060
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:55,980
OK.

1061
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,120
Alright, and go!

1062
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,600
Yeah!

1063
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,480
Take your stuff!

1064
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:17,780
Yeah!

1065
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,680
OK.

1066
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,140
Why enemy so dumb?

1067
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,660
It's just how it goes.

1068
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,780
Oh yeah, it says homeless hope.

1069
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,760
What the hell?

1070
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,740
Why is the homeless shelter in like a saloon font?

1071
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,380
Excuse me?

1072
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,720
Yeah.

1073
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,780
OK, so we need to...

1074
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,860
Oh my god!

1075
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,320
I did the wrong... Wait.

1076
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,620
Oh yeah, that's right.

1077
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,320
You can't sneak.

1078
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,860
You can't sneak while it's in a...

1079
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,170
I got the nodges.

1080
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,770
Homeless cowboys.

1081
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,590
It's like the homeless baseball team.

1082
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,730
OK, take the money.

1083
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,590
Take more money.

1084
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,430
We like that.

1085
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,990
How do I... Let's see.

1086
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,650
What haven't we explored in this area?

1087
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,150
I feel like it's so quiet.

1088
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,430
And I can't do these.

1089
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,890
Oh wait!

1090
00:54:58,650 --> 00:54:59,750
Stay where you are!

1091
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:01,550
Drop the gun!

1092
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,690
Drop it!

1093
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:04,650
Don't!

1094
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:05,890
Don't!

1095
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:09,490
And that's how they died?

1096
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,510
They both... They shot each other?

1097
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,230
I guess... Sorry, you can barely hear the game at this point.

1098
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:22,750
OK, let's go down.

1099
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,050
Maybe this one.

1100
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,790
What the...

1101
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,050
Yeah!

1102
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1103
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,430
Alright, down.

1104
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:49,870
Maybe down through here.

1105
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,270
Oh wait, there's more.

1106
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,370
What was down there?

1107
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,130
Also, there's this.

1108
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,230
A ghost man walking.

1109
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,630
A ghost man walking.

1110
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,050
Oh wait, I think I can go down through here.

1111
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:05,890
Aha!

1112
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:07,310
What is this?

1113
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,910
What the...

1114
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,600
What...

1115
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,400
Um...

1116
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,440
What does that mean?

1117
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,900
You can hear it fine?

1118
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,200
OK.

1119
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,440
Maybe it's just me.

1120
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,000
I don't know.

1121
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,540
Sorry guys.

1122
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,000
I can't get the audio balance incorrect at all today.

1123
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:30,740
I'm so sorry.

1124
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,500
What does that mean?

1125
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:37,520
Hello?

1126
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,100
I think I have to like run in between.

1127
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,900
Like that.

1128
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,680
There we go.

1129
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,540
Oh, is this the one we've been looking for?

1130
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,140
No?

1131
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,640
What one opens that door?

1132
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,060
That is creepy.

1133
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,500
Familiar voice actor?

1134
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,360
Oh yeah.

1135
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,160
You would know Adamska.

1136
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,420
Woop!

1137
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,100
Yeah, get him in a loop.

1138
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:15,960
OK.

1139
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,160
OK, this door is...

1140
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:20,580
blocked?

1141
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,740
OK, interesting.

1142
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,660
OK.

1143
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,620
I think we've killed like everybody in this place at this point.

1144
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,560
Oh wait, I could have just gone up through here.

1145
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,080
Whatever.

1146
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,040
Alright.

1147
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,180
OK.

1148
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,610
This thing...

1149
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,190
What?

1150
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,780
What did that mean?

1151
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,460
What did that do?

1152
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,400
What do you mean?

1153
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,900
Oh come on!

1154
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,940
Enable focus to get useful information.

1155
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,780
I'm not seeing anything useful about it.

1156
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,640
What does that mean?

1157
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,660
Useful information where?

1158
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,820
Oh, it's probably... Oh I see, I see.

1159
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,620
It's where the pipe goes.

1160
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:26,920
OK.

1161
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,320
Oh, it's a one hit wonder.

1162
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,220
Easy peasy.

1163
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,400
Oh, and it revives.

1164
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,260
Oh my god.

1165
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,120
Come here.

1166
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:43,870
Alright.

1167
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:45,470
Oh shit!

1168
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:46,790
No.

1169
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,410
Don't do this to me.

1170
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:51,590
OK, run.

1171
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:52,130
Alright.

1172
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,690
Why are there so many of you?

1173
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:55,590
Nasties.

1174
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,190
OK, so... Oh my gosh.

1175
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,050
Wait, we have to do like real math and stuff in this game.

1176
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,150
To figure out how to open the damn door.

1177
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,810
So fight!

1178
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,030
OK, maybe not.

1179
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,150
Maybe it's just like...

1180
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,790
OK, so now we go to the next one.

1181
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,510
Something screamed.

1182
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,610
Wait, OK.

1183
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,810
It's wireless through here and then it goes up.

1184
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:22,950
OK.

1185
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,270
How do I get up?

1186
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:24,770
Oh, here we go.

1187
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,330
Up.

1188
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:29,950
Through here.

1189
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,070
It goes to this one maybe?

1190
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,370
OK, and then that goes up.

1191
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,290
Maybe to here?

1192
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,330
Yes.

1193
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:51,510
It's got a lot to say, huh?

1194
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,230
OK, now it's wifi.

1195
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,230
Down, down.

1196
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:00,810
Wait.

1197
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,620
I'm not quite sure.

1198
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,480
Wait.

1199
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,900
Math, it's so over.

1200
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,420
It's so over for me.

1201
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,420
The what?

1202
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,760
We need to maybe look for more...

1203
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,000
Oh,

1204
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,200
wait.

1205
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,340
That one...

1206
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,220
There are so many lines!

1207
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:32,540
Huh?

1208
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,880
OK, this one is new, right?

1209
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,000
This one.

1210
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,000
OK, OK, OK.

1211
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,540
And now it connected.

1212
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,020
I wish I could go up.

1213
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,080
Why can't you get on the bunk beds?

1214
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,200
OK.

1215
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:50,720
Alright.

1216
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,900
So now it's that one.

1217
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,380
Wait, I can go up through here.

1218
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,740
There we go.

1219
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,580
All set!

1220
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,800
That's a great question.

1221
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:09,460
OK.

1222
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,900
Now we can go through the door.

1223
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,600
Is there anything over here?

1224
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,740
Look, we can somehow go up there.

1225
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,640
Maybe we come back down through here.

1226
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,300
Big brain Minto.

1227
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,680
Alright, we are going to be that ghost man.

1228
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,780
Oh my god.

1229
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:32,500
OK.

1230
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,740
I'm going to drop down.

1231
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,940
I wish I could save.

1232
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:47,490
OK.

1233
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,510
Alright.

1234
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,470
Oh, no, no, no.

1235
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,350
Oh, I can't drop down there.

1236
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,710
Oh my gosh.

1237
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,450
OK.

1238
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,010
Don't touch the walls.

1239
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,090
Did I mess up?

1240
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,350
Oh my god.

1241
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,050
Heal, heal, heal.

1242
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:19,250
Hello.

1243
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,510
Hello.

1244
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,070
Who built this?

1245
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,030
Why are there so much...

1246
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,590
Everything in the basement.

1247
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:28,510
Nastiness.

1248
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,730
It's the last section of Lifeline all over again with like save points.

1249
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,150
Yeah, but way less pressure in this, I think.

1250
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,450
Yeah!

1251
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:44,450
Game saved!

1252
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,130
And it heals everything.

1253
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,450
Oh my gosh, that's so nice.

1254
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,010
Alright, perfect.

1255
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:53,530
Wee-woo.

1256
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:55,690
Wee-woo.

1257
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:56,850
Is this a boss fight?

1258
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:57,890
Oh, it's hell.

1259
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:06,130
That's the guy over there, right?

1260
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:06,610
Not me.

1261
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:10,370
Eva.

1262
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:15,790
It's Eva!

1263
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,150
Eva 9000.

1264
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:27,670
You should be more concerned by the fact that you are also organic matter.

1265
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,970
Thank you, genius.

1266
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,570
Excuse me.

1267
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,910
Oh my gosh.

1268
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,270
Ow!

1269
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:56,170
How am I supposed to avoid that?

1270
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:58,730
Maybe I just go around.

1271
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:00,550
Ok.

1272
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,050
Cool.

1273
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:08,030
I wish I could see what the health is like on this thing.

1274
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,750
What are those?

1275
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,110
Oh!

1276
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,190
Oh

1277
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:25,240
no!

1278
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,280
Get in the corner!

1279
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,480
There is like no iframes in this game.

1280
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:33,980
Maybe.

1281
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,180
Oh no.

1282
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,960
Ouchie, ouchie.

1283
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:41,360
Ok.

1284
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,470
Ok, ok.

1285
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:47,710
Next round?

1286
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:48,550
Maybe.

1287
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:51,330
We are back to this.

1288
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,210
Ouch, ouch!

1289
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:59,330
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1290
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,870
This game is not very forgiving, huh?

1291
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:03,870
I get it.

1292
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:04,890
I get it.

1293
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:07,010
I get it.

1294
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:08,570
Come on!

1295
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:09,350
Destroy!

1296
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:10,190
Kill!

1297
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:10,550
Kill!

1298
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:10,850
Kill!

1299
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,430
Did I get it?

1300
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,750
I'm just going to keep going.

1301
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,830
I'm not doing anything, but I'm going to go!

1302
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:23,930
I don't think...

1303
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,190
Yay!

1304
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:30,770
First try!

1305
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:33,950
So true.

1306
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,690
Ok, yapper.

1307
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,890
I wonder if dodging does give you iframes.

1308
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:42,570
Maybe it does.

1309
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,010
I don't want to reflect on that shit.

1310
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,670
They are wrong here.

1311
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:49,950
Not me.

1312
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,250
His growl is like ASMR.

1313
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,570
In my ears.

1314
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:00,850
Anyway.

1315
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:08,940
Is that a snake?

1316
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:09,780
It is indeed.

1317
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,320
Yeah!

1318
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:12,880
Alright.

1319
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,820
Bye Eva9000!

1320
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,240
What is this?

1321
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,760
What is this?

1322
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,720
I like his design so much.

1323
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,140
Dash allows you to burst in the air with grace.

1324
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,980
Such a majestic creature.

1325
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,360
Ok.

1326
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,460
Wait, can I like dash?

1327
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,510
Wow, that's actually a lot.

1328
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,450
Today is my birthday!

1329
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,610
Shiromikan happy birthday!

1330
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,790
Happy birthday to you!

1331
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,190
Happy birthday to you!

1332
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,130
Happy birthday Shiromikan!

1333
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,570
Happy birthday to you!

1334
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:11,550
Happy birthday!

1335
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,560
I don't know what...Oh!

1336
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,600
It's this thing again.

1337
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,160
Come back!

1338
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:27,640
Come back!

1339
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,740
I wonder if we can get crushed by that.

1340
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,940
That would be pretty silly.

1341
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,380
Oh, that goes back down.

1342
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,120
Every time I see one, I feel like I must trigger it.

1343
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:42,640
You know what I mean?

1344
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,320
Alright.

1345
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,340
Oh!

1346
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,580
Dead people.

1347
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,520
More dead lab coats.

1348
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,940
And more ugly things.

1349
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,100
Trying to kill us.

1350
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,280
Alright.

1351
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,240
Woah!

1352
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,420
Oh my gosh!

1353
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,240
Back rooms!

1354
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:04,970
What?!

1355
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:07,350
I think I might be too slow crawling up them.

1356
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:08,390
Ew!

1357
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,370
He's like breathing and stuff.

1358
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:12,710
Ok.

1359
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:13,650
Alright, alright.

1360
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:14,850
How's Matt Suitman?

1361
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:18,510
Oh,

1362
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:25,160
sorry.

1363
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:25,220
Sorry.

1364
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,080
Alright, let's get his ass.

1365
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:31,500
Oh, just kidding.

1366
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,780
And drop.

1367
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,480
Slice and dice!

1368
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,620
Slice and dice!

1369
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,680
Artemis, thank you so much for the 5 Ginten.

1370
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,080
Thank you.

1371
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,040
What is this?

1372
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,880
The aesthetic of this game is everywhere.

1373
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,840
You got...you got...

1374
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,200
Gross monsters.

1375
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,160
You got...

1376
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,780
What is this?

1377
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,500
Nasty!

1378
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,380
Oh no!

1379
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:58,960
Nasty!

1380
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,600
Oh my god.

1381
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,720
What the hell?

1382
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:09,610
Ok, so air boost only works if I'm in the air.

1383
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:10,510
Got it.

1384
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,790
Can I...was it only down?

1385
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:15,910
Yeah, I think so.

1386
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:18,410
Only down.

1387
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,920
More dead people!

1388
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,500
Oh gosh, these guys again.

1389
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,320
Oh, they're so gross.

1390
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,620
Oh, they're nasty.

1391
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,100
I don't like the sound they make either.

1392
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,500
It's so squelchy.

1393
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,900
Ok, we can get this guy too.

1394
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:43,860
Probably.

1395
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,680
And drop.

1396
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,760
And kill.

1397
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,360
A solid plop.

1398
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,420
Disgusting.

1399
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:55,560
What the hell is that?

1400
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,960
Oh gosh.

1401
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,820
Ok, it's the same as that other thing, but with razor blades and also it explodes.

1402
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,560
Like, it's the same as the other explodey one, but like, not.

1403
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,900
Ok, so this goes somewhere, so we're just gonna flip the switch, baby.

1404
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,780
Ok, alright, cool.

1405
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,440
I wish it did.

1406
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:21,200
You know how like in some games, when you like crouch down, it shows you what's below you?

1407
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:26,880
So, that's something I feel that is missing from this.

1408
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:27,940
You know what I mean?

1409
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,000
Did I go over here before?

1410
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:31,420
No.

1411
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,080
Oh, we're fine.

1412
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:36,500
Cool.

1413
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,040
It's my birthday.

1414
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:43,400
I started doing this bit where a phone conversation goes on too long, I start talking like a snake, like a codec call.

1415
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,880
My mom called and is now really mad.

1416
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,880
I think that's pretty solid.

1417
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:57,000
But happy birthday, cat daddy!

1418
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,460
Happy birthday to you.

1419
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,980
Happy birthday to you.

1420
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,360
Happy birthday dear the cat daddy.

1421
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,320
Happy birthday to you.

1422
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,380
Happy birthday!

1423
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:14,560
Ok.

1424
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,080
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1425
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,100
I'm getting flamethrowered.

1426
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:26,220
And he's still going.

1427
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,720
Ok, bye bye.

1428
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:29,880
No more alert.

1429
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,040
Oh my gosh, imagine if there was a button in Metal Gear to just get rid of an alert.

1430
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,640
Sounds amazing.

1431
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,640
Sounds like a dream come true.

1432
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,320
What is going... What the hell?

1433
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,340
This place has gone to hell.

1434
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:54,170
Nasty.

1435
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:57,170
Ouch!

1436
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:04,870
Gosh, they're so scary.

1437
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:06,770
This one's not even moving.

1438
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,110
Ok, very nice.

1439
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:14,390
These guys are not bad, I just gotta be fast about it.

1440
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,850
I think whatever they were experimenting on kinda messed up.

1441
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,150
I think they made a... whoopsie.

1442
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:22,610
Is this steam gonna hurt me?

1443
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:24,770
No, it's called steam dolls.

1444
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,830
Of course it wouldn't... Ok, now I'm lost.

1445
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,570
This map is huge!

1446
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,550
Oh my god!

1447
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:39,450
Oh, ok, alright, ok, alright.

1448
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,130
Ok.

1449
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:43,970
Where are we?

1450
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,610
Were we here before?

1451
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:57,350
Nice.

1452
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,670
I hope it exploded.

1453
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,310
I don't wanna jump if I don't know where I'm going.

1454
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,950
Ok, that's where I went.

1455
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:14,590
I can't... I wish I could crouch down and...

1456
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:18,270
That's where that goes.

1457
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:20,350
Is death.

1458
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:23,490
Oh my god.

1459
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,210
That was so fast.

1460
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,150
Alright, nice.

1461
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:32,790
I'm gonna heal with the newfound energy we got.

1462
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,850
Ok, very good.

1463
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,170
Alright.

1464
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,890
I don't know where we are guys.

1465
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,390
I don't know where we're going.

1466
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,050
But we're doing something.

1467
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,630
Oh, wait.

1468
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,390
We gotta save.

1469
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:49,970
And, look at that.

1470
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:50,630
Wait, wait, wait.

1471
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,940
Sub weapon acquired!

1472
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,140
Plasma knives.

1473
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:02,880
Plasma knives can activate out of reach switches, but you can also use them as weapons of course.

1474
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:07,080
Swap sub weapons by pressing or holding Y.

1475
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:11,230
Wait.

1476
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:13,650
Oh, I see.

1477
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:14,330
It's up in the...

1478
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:18,190
So, sub weapon I'm guessing is B.

1479
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,230
Ok, got it.

1480
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,870
Sounds like something Raiden would use.

1481
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,390
Oh, that's where this leads!

1482
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:35,830
Remember how I made note of this earlier?

1483
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:41,570
Does it use... I think it uses my blue.

1484
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:43,610
Ok, bye.

1485
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:45,010
Anyway.

1486
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:49,870
We're going back into the hell room.

1487
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:51,810
Alright, we gotta go through all of this again.

1488
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,610
It's ok, we'll go to the save point.

1489
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:54,170
We'll get there.

1490
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:02,810
I am like a cat with such quick reflexes.

1491
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:15,950
Now, this part I don't quite understand how I get...

1492
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,710
How I'm supposed to get over it.

1493
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,750
I don't think I should air dash.

1494
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,330
I will run into the other blades.

1495
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,850
It's ok, there's a save right down here.

1496
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,200
It's ok, we get our health and everything back right here.

1497
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:38,780
Right?

1498
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:39,220
Yeah.

1499
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:42,620
Right here.

1500
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,360
Yeah, alright.

1501
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,260
Maybe they mean for that.

1502
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,520
Alright, this is where we did the boss battle.

1503
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,900
And onward.

1504
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,620
Bad again.

1505
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,380
And switch.

1506
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:08,840
Bye, Eva.

1507
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:18,100
Yeah, they just have a saw room for like no reason.

1508
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,140
It's pretty exciting stuff.

1509
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:23,080
Oh no, I'm gonna have to go through all the guys that I fought.

1510
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:25,420
Again.

1511
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,080
Isn't there a guy here or am I crazy?

1512
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:30,580
No.

1513
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,480
Here he is.

1514
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,040
I don't know who's talking.

1515
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:49,620
So, let's...

1516
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,840
We need to go more up it seems.

1517
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:58,350
Nasties.

1518
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,050
Those guys are so gross.

1519
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:00,650
I hate them.

1520
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:08,080
We need to go...

1521
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,060
Up, upper, up right.

1522
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,200
Gross.

1523
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,360
So here and here.

1524
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,220
Did I do that?

1525
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:25,680
No.

1526
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,960
Oh no, I can't.

1527
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,880
Oh man.

1528
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,800
Ok, we'll figure it out.

1529
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,540
You guys hear that guy?

1530
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:50,630
He's cracking me up.

1531
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:55,430
Oh shit.

1532
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:57,570
Oh my gosh, he scared the heck out of me.

1533
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:01,150
I think in here actually.

1534
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,230
Oh yeah, there's this guy here too.

1535
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:13,170
That's not making me very sneaky.

1536
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:14,930
Dang it.

1537
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,750
Ok, we'll just sneak down through here instead.

1538
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,550
I keep hearing someone.

1539
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:20,710
What was that?

1540
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:29,900
Nice.

1541
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,320
Ok, so...

1542
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,620
That didn't go anywhere.

1543
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,320
Map.

1544
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,120
Slice and dice baby.

1545
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,040
What do I... Where do I go?

1546
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,640
Maybe I go back up?

1547
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,460
Is there a way that I...

1548
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,520
Who's talking?

1549
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,640
They're really yapping at... Oh, here we go.

1550
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,580
Really yappers up in here.

1551
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,980
Maybe... Oh yes, I went to the left.

1552
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,060
So here, we go this way.

1553
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:27,640
Ok.

1554
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,180
Alright.

1555
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,160
Nasty.

1556
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,580
Ok.

1557
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,880
Good to know those explode.

1558
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,680
Ok, cool.

1559
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:38,660
Oh my gosh.

1560
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:41,340
Ok,

1561
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,900
that killed that guy.

1562
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:49,380
Alright.

1563
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,120
Oh my god.

1564
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:53,980
Oh my god.

1565
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:54,760
Stop it.

1566
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:55,180
Stop.

1567
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,020
I need to follow it.

1568
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,700
Can I follow it?

1569
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:02,840
Down.

1570
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:03,760
Ok, nice.

1571
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:05,580
What's that?

1572
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,220
Oh my god.

1573
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,860
It's going to chop me.

1574
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,160
I have to be so fast.

1575
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,880
Oh golly.

1576
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:20,940
Ok.

1577
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:25,720
Ok,

1578
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:39,360
we killed him.

1579
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:39,760
We're fine.

1580
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:40,560
Everything's ok.

1581
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,420
Everything's fine.

1582
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,720
I just ran into a guy on accident.

1583
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,360
No biggie.

1584
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,100
NBD.

1585
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,320
No big deal.

1586
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,840
There's nothing over here?

1587
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,760
Who built this?

1588
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:01,870
Ok.

1589
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,770
Grab some more money.

1590
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,790
Come here.

1591
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:10,970
I'm trying to bait you.

1592
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:17,550
Oh, you're stronger than the others.

1593
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:21,010
We're fine.

1594
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,730
Everything's good.

1595
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:24,310
Ok.

1596
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:25,970
Alright.

1597
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:27,230
Where are we?

1598
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:31,270
Who?

1599
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:35,630
Oh, that guy?

1600
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:36,130
Yeah.

1601
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:37,730
Ripperoni.

1602
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,930
Joe built a decorative saw.

1603
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:50,070
This area is huge.

1604
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:53,250
Also, this demo is huge.

1605
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:55,430
There's so much going on.

1606
01:21:58,030 --> 01:21:58,830
Oh no!

1607
01:21:59,210 --> 01:21:59,890
I forgot.

1608
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:00,770
Wait, how do I...

1609
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:01,030
Why?

1610
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,750
Ok, now we can yell.

1611
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:02,970
Ok,

1612
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:06,610
this works.

1613
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,670
The elevator.

1614
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,670
Was there anything over here?

1615
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:16,210
Nope.

1616
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:18,970
I forgot it's a demo.

1617
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:19,770
I know, right?

1618
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:21,850
It's so long.

1619
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:22,610
I told you guys.

1620
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:34,430
Nasty.

1621
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,850
That one?

1622
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:38,890
Ok.

1623
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,170
What does that do?

1624
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,210
Oh, switch.

1625
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:51,030
Ok.

1626
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:52,130
Ok.

1627
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,390
Now that should go...

1628
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,490
What does this one do anyway?

1629
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:56,030
I don't know.

1630
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:56,570
Anyway.

1631
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,270
And this way is blocked by an evil branch.

1632
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:01,710
Ok.

1633
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:04,190
We love to see it.

1634
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,580
And now this one's powered on.

1635
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,540
Ok, we go up.

1636
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,340
Oh, it gives you blue?

1637
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,000
No way.

1638
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,600
So I can get rid of the thing.

1639
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,420
I should've...

1640
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,360
I should've farmed.

1641
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:26,980
I'm an idiot.

1642
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,360
Oh, cutscene.

1643
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,130
Hello.

1644
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:56,090
Hold your fire.

1645
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:06,430
I don't understand the story at all.

1646
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:09,730
There are always complications.

1647
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,330
Am I gonna have to fight all these guys?

1648
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:16,170
Or...

1649
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,280
Oh!

1650
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,460
Uh-oh.

1651
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,780
Stop a bad...

1652
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:39,050
Oh,

1653
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:43,590
the ship has eyes.

1654
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:45,130
I'm running.

1655
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:48,510
Do you actually want me to run?

1656
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:49,450
I'll run.

1657
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,010
Here I go.

1658
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:58,350
Oh, shoot.

1659
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:01,790
We're running.

1660
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:10,150
Ok, we're running.

1661
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,230
Oh my God.

1662
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,070
Dang it.

1663
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:25,710
There is no music.

1664
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:32,530
I'm wondering if maybe there will be some music in the final version of the game.

1665
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:36,310
Oh my God!

1666
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:36,630
No!

1667
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:37,170
I did it again!

1668
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:39,170
What the...

1669
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,870
Oh gosh, ok.

1670
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,850
She's in pursuit, you guys.

1671
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:48,150
That's what I...I don't know.

1672
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:51,130
She will if I can manage to get past this.

1673
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:53,170
I'm not gonna chase...

1674
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,030
chase platformers.

1675
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:56,390
No!

1676
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:57,990
My timing!

1677
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,930
She's standing down.

1678
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:03,410
I mean, no.

1679
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,370
She's in pursuit.

1680
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:14,670
Oh my God.

1681
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:18,030
Guys.

1682
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:20,150
Guys, I'm sorry.

1683
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:21,810
I'm sorry.

1684
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:24,850
I'm really not good at scenes like this.

1685
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,450
I'm really not good at scenes like this.

1686
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:32,130
Next week.

1687
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:37,930
Ok, nice.

1688
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:50,450
Oh my God!

1689
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:52,490
I

1690
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:59,980
got killed mid-combo.

1691
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,940
I got killed mid-combo.

1692
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,320
Pieces of you next week.

1693
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,940
She really does like the sound of her own voice.

1694
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,480
Ok.

1695
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,640
This game is very sassy, yes.

1696
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:22,220
Oh you know.

1697
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:26,780
Ok.

1698
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,440
Have a little faith.

1699
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:43,560
Down?

1700
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:44,680
Wait.

1701
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:45,300
Oh, down.

1702
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,700
Oh my gosh, I can't see anything.

1703
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,660
Actually, I think there is music.

1704
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,300
I think it's just very quiet.

1705
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,760
Pieces of you next week.

1706
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,420
She really does like the sound of her own voice.

1707
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,280
I know.

1708
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,300
He knows!

1709
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:24,420
He knows.

1710
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:46,380
Oh my gosh.

1711
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,120
We made it!

1712
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,520
No we didn't!

1713
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,800
Oh my God, everything is going down.

1714
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,680
Everything is going down!

1715
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,020
Ok, we are fine.

1716
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,780
Enough already.

1717
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,660
Explosion.gif?

1718
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,840
We made it!

1719
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:13,540
I think.

1720
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:14,400
I hope.

1721
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,140
Enough already.

1722
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:32,750
Oh!

1723
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:35,510
Did I really get through the demo?

1724
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:38,130
Is that it?

1725
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:40,590
I did it?

1726
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:44,190
I got through the demo maybe?

1727
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:44,990
Title drop?

1728
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,350
Am I a gamer?

1729
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:51,450
Oh my gosh, someone said it took them two hours to beat it.

1730
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:52,910
Someone said...

1731
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:53,390
What?

1732
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:55,970
Geronimo!

1733
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:57,910
Welcome to my voice chat.

1734
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:58,590
Thank you.

1735
01:29:58,750 --> 01:29:59,330
Thanks for joining.

1736
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:00,850
I was short.

1737
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:03,090
It ended up being so much shorter.

1738
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:05,890
Took me just an hour and a half.

1739
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:07,630
And then I also yapped at the beginning.

1740
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:10,670
I think I'm too much of a gamer.

1741
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,720
That's it.

1742
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,360
I'm too strong.

1743
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,360
That was fun though.

1744
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:25,900
Let's see.

1745
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,640
Steam dolls on Steam.

1746
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,520
Oh my gosh.

1747
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,280
Sorry, I was on Duck Detective earlier.

1748
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:39,120
Duck Detective has a new game called Duck Detective the Ghost of Glamping.

1749
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,580
And I was like, ghost!

1750
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,380
That's me!

1751
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,900
So, I was looking at it on the Steam page earlier.

1752
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,120
You're more of a gamer than you realize.

1753
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:51,780
It's true!

1754
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,600
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

1755
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,840
Wins Duck Detective.

1756
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:00,880
You guys want to hear?

1757
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,280
Hold on.

1758
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,460
I'll share my Steam.

1759
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,920
Give me a second.

1760
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,880
We can watch the trailer for Duck Detective.

1761
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,580
Steam.

1762
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,300
Steam.

1763
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,980
Let's watch Duck Detective together.

1764
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:31,530
I've always been drawn to mystery and misery.

1765
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:34,710
Like a duck to water.

1766
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:35,650
He's a duck.

1767
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:38,770
Do you guys remember the first Duck Detective?

1768
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:41,850
Oh, he's back!

1769
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,450
And you have a sidekick.

1770
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:50,270
The little gator guy from the first game.

1771
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:53,730
She's vain because she has perfect skin.

1772
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:55,470
That just means she has...

1773
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:58,370
That just means she has good genetics.

1774
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:10,890
Beware of the ghost!

1775
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:11,310
The ghost!

1776
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:20,350
Duck Detective.

1777
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:23,310
The Ghost of Glamping.

1778
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:26,850
Wasn't the gator a big fanboy?

1779
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was.

1780
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:30,970
I'm also kind of offended.

1781
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:33,270
I said I wanted a voice act in this game.

1782
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:37,890
I feel like I could make a wonderful character of...

1783
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:39,770
Somebody.

1784
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:41,590
No one left.

1785
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:42,650
What does that say?

1786
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:45,070
Keep...

1787
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:46,330
Something fried.

1788
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,710
Cinderathalos!

1789
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:51,610
Thanks for the five gifts!

1790
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:53,970
Yeah, wait.

1791
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:57,730
So Steam Dolls VR.

1792
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:58,430
No, no.

1793
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,850
Is there a VR?

1794
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:05,180
For VR?

1795
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:06,600
No way.

1796
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:07,680
Is it the same game?

1797
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:10,900
What's happening?

1798
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,740
What is this?

1799
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,080
Is this the same game?

1800
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,640
I can't tell.

1801
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,300
It has like the same logo.

1802
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:31,100
It has the same logo, so I'm confused.

1803
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,740
I thought that was Vamp.

1804
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:35,660
Oh gosh.

1805
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,880
Oh my god.

1806
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:38,860
It does look like Vamp.

1807
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:40,380
And you have Ariel.

1808
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,660
The graphics are... I don't know if I would want to see those in VR.

1809
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,860
How does this...

1810
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,280
Oh yeah, it's the dev the same.

1811
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:54,680
Let's see.

1812
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,220
To the sky, dear.

1813
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,020
I love this song!

1814
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:09,040
What's it called again?

1815
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,280
Oh my gosh.

1816
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:10,680
Wait.

1817
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,300
I love that song.

1818
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,000
I used to listen to that song all the time.

1819
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,580
Wow, that's such a throwback for me.

1820
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,660
Order of Chaos.

1821
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:17,420
Ok, here we go.

1822
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,360
The Shady Gentleman.

1823
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,080
It is the same.

1824
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,160
Johnny Bronzehand.

1825
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:23,780
What?

1826
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,620
Devon Chott?

1827
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:26,660
Wait, where?

1828
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,340
Hello?

1829
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:28,640
Hello?

1830
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:30,100
Hello?

1831
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:30,400
Hello?

1832
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:30,980
Hello?

1833
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:33,020
Hello?

1834
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,340
I just finished the demo.

1835
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,640
I had so much fun.

1836
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:42,920
Well, thank you!

1837
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,740
Hello, dev, if you are here.

1838
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:46,900
Hi.

1839
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,180
I couldn't find you.

1840
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:49,700
Where are you?

1841
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:50,480
I don't know.

1842
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,180
Thanks for the buy gift!

1843
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,520
Wait, let's see the trailer for the full game.

1844
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,480
Oh, as designer of Order of Chaos, I was not involved in the VR demo.

1845
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,060
Hello!

1846
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,860
Thanks for dropping by!

1847
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,040
We just finished the demo.

1848
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,620
The atmosphere is great.

1849
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,840
It looks so fun.

1850
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,560
I mean, it was fun.

1851
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,060
It looks so...

1852
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,440
So meaty.

1853
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:44,740
Jennifer Hale is in this game?

1854
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,240
Yes!

1855
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,140
That's what I'm saying!

1856
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:49,720
You got David Hayter, you got Christopher Randolph, you got Jennifer Hale.

1857
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,900
It's such a star-studded cast.

1858
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,280
What was that?

1859
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,320
I like that this game even has cutscenes.

1860
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,040
That's so insane.

1861
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,160
This song is a bop.

1862
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:40,640
Very cool.

1863
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:42,700
Thank you for the good luck.

1864
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,380
I cleared... You cleared what?

1865
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,240
Of course!

1866
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,220
Congrats?

1867
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,800
Thank you, Brie, for the superchat.

1868
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:56,660
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

1869
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:01,460
Oh yeah, we were in... Actually no, we did do this part.

1870
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:02,560
I killed that guy.

1871
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:05,820
Well actually I think I landed on his head and then I...

1872
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,440
And then I beat him up.

1873
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,220
Everything is so icky.

1874
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:13,160
In a good way.

1875
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,700
I mean it's supposed to be icky.

1876
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,260
Wow, yeah we saw this.

1877
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:18,920
What?

1878
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,740
What is going on in this game?

1879
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,100
What is happening?

1880
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,180
Wow.

1881
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:39,760
I like that it is a stealth... It's interesting to have a stealth metroidvania game.

1882
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,080
Exploration, stealth and blood.

1883
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,400
We are really proud of it.

1884
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,440
Still working hard during the early access.

1885
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:08,220
We are two on the dev so it's a lot of work.

1886
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:10,340
Oh my gosh, you guys are cracked.

1887
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:15,120
Well, good luck with everything.

1888
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,120
Wow, two man team.

1889
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,280
Sheesh, and this is what it looks like.

1890
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,080
Two man team and this is how it looks.

1891
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:24,940
What the hell?

1892
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:31,600
How did you end up getting David Hayter and Jennifer Hale and Christopher Randolph?

1893
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:39,720
I had a lot of fun.

1894
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:41,660
Again, I didn't think I mentioned this at all.

1895
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:44,980
I don't think I felt like I really needed to mention it.

1896
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,640
I'm not sponsored or anything to play it.

1897
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,920
I just wanted to play it because, you know, I was honest.

1898
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:56,360
I was like, you know, Metal Gear voice actors are in the game so I'm going to play it.

1899
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,560
Obviously, these are my real opinions.

1900
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:04,180
Without any money backing them.

1901
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,080
Raymac, thanks for the 5 gifted.

1902
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,420
That was very obvious.

1903
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,980
Well, I just want to say, you know, just anything.

1904
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:18,420
You know, some people might be like, oh, she's only singing praises.

1905
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:20,660
She must be sponsored.

1906
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,640
Getting the cast is just a try that succeeded.

1907
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,440
Wow.

1908
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,420
That's so awesome.

1909
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,140
Are you guys fans of Metal Gear 2 then?

1910
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,580
Sorry, I'm really Metal Gear brain.

1911
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,760
But I played this and it was really awesome.

1912
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,040
I will buy it.

1913
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,240
Oh, and it's on sale.

1914
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:47,900
Look at that.

1915
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:55,460
Oh, Valentina.

1916
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,880
I wonder if that's Jennifer Hale.

1917
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:08,790
Yeah, I did that.

1918
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:09,470
That was me.

1919
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:12,350
I did that.

1920
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:13,370
That was me.

1921
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:14,010
Yeah.

1922
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:18,650
Hacking skills.

1923
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:20,490
Oh, I like that actually.

1924
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:22,730
I think that's really cool to see like the hints.

1925
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:26,430
And to see like, oh, go this way with the little ghosties.

1926
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:32,030
I call small dev indie games penny stocks because you might strike it rich.

1927
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:36,070
Oh, when you strike it rich, you really strike it rich.

1928
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:37,450
Sometimes though, they do flop.

1929
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:39,770
That's just the nature of the games though, right?

1930
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,310
Even, even triple A titles flop.

1931
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:46,610
So, you know, I just like games.

1932
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:49,150
I just like game.

1933
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:54,390
So I think it's fun to play game and to try all sorts of game.

1934
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:56,430
And that's why I was like, I'll try something new today.

1935
01:40:56,510 --> 01:41:03,490
Because, you know, probably many people might not give this a chance, you know?

1936
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,990
So, why not?

1937
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:11,510
If I can even get one extra person to check it out and, you know, be interested in it.

1938
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:13,710
Controversial opinion.

1939
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:14,790
Yeah, I know.

1940
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:16,430
I'm full of those.

1941
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:19,030
I'm full of those.

1942
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,750
And I like platformers.

1943
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:24,990
I'm always wanting to get better at platformers.

1944
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:32,950
That's always one thing that I'm like, you know, I, I, yes, would like to get better.

1945
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:36,690
Oh, so that was Jennifer Hale as Stella.

1946
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:41,890
You will encounter a flamboyant cast as you traverse the game.

1947
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:43,450
A goddess of nature.

1948
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:45,990
A rich immortal who wants to die.

1949
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:48,590
A female gunslinger with deadly aim.

1950
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:49,510
And others?

1951
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,790
Who's to say?

1952
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:53,910
Oh, Joy Princess, thank you.

1953
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:54,950
And Yanmei, thank you.

1954
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:56,590
The aesthetic is cool and unexpected.

1955
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:59,530
From the title, I thought it would be, it would look like Alisa.

1956
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:02,950
A horror game where the currency is metal gears.

1957
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:06,090
No way.

1958
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:09,390
Enemies.

1959
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:11,790
I can't believe it has cutscenes though.

1960
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,930
Games like this rarely ever have cutscenes.

1961
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:19,570
But yeah, platforming is always like something that I like.

1962
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:23,770
But it's, it's, you know, it's like, like Celeste, you know.

1963
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:32,130
The, you really got to build up in terms of, it's, I feel once you get good at platformers, it really helps with your, what's the word?

1964
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:36,410
Your reaction time and things like that.

1965
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:39,770
So, I'm always, I'm always wanting to do that.

1966
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:40,710
Look at these.

1967
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:41,290
What is this?

1968
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,490
This looks cute as hell.

1969
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:44,250
It's a Doom?

1970
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:45,370
Wait.

1971
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:47,730
It's anime Doom?

1972
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:49,470
Wait, I've seen this before.

1973
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:51,650
I have seen this before.

1974
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:53,310
No way.

1975
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:56,470
I have seen, what?

1976
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:58,250
I have seen this game before.

1977
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:06,230
It already has a sequel.

1978
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:08,310
I didn't know that.

1979
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:11,490
Six episodes and 30 levels.

1980
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:13,570
Yeah, yeah, I remember this trailer.

1981
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:14,790
I remember watching this.

1982
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:19,090
I thought I added it to my wish list.

1983
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:21,050
No, I guess not.

1984
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:22,230
I'll add it, I'll get it later.

1985
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:24,930
I...

1986
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,450
What else is here?

1987
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:28,750
Frog gun.

1988
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:31,350
Dang, there's a ton here.

1989
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:37,910
The Guro game.

1990
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:38,370
What?

1991
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:39,130
Citadel?

1992
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:41,770
What is?

1993
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:46,990
Is it really?

1994
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:51,250
It's a tad Guro.

1995
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:53,210
Maybe YouTube won't...

1996
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:54,630
Maybe that's why I didn't get it.

1997
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:56,850
Ero Guro.

1998
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:01,930
Maybe YouTube will get mad at me.

1999
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:05,610
I don't...

2000
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:07,070
Okay, this might be a...

2001
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:08,790
Sorry, that was my controller disconnecting.

2002
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,630
This might be a controversial opinion.

2003
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,430
I'm typically okay with Ero Guro.

2004
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:15,810
Or rather, like anime Guro.

2005
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:18,030
Because it's...

2006
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:19,970
It's the same as like anime horror.

2007
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:20,770
It just...

2008
01:44:20,770 --> 01:44:21,990
It feels very...

2009
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:23,790
It's like not...

2010
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:25,690
Like, it's...

2011
01:44:25,690 --> 01:44:26,490
I can very...

2012
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:29,930
I can very much take myself out of it.

2013
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:30,610
You know what I mean?

2014
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:32,730
It's 100% not real.

2015
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:35,350
So it doesn't get to me as much.

2016
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:36,430
Yeah, it's cartoony.

2017
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:37,150
Exactly.

2018
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:42,530
I grew up on Corpse Party YouTube videos too?

2019
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:45,130
You grew up watching Corpse Party?

2020
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:48,850
I grew up playing the heck out of Corpse Party.

2021
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:50,130
I...

2022
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:50,950
Oh my gosh.

2023
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:53,110
I played so much Corpse Party.

2024
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:56,890
You watched it.

2025
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:57,970
I lived it.

2026
01:44:58,350 --> 01:44:59,290
In my death.

2027
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:01,250
Mhm.

2028
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:08,770
You weren't allowed to get it.

2029
01:45:08,830 --> 01:45:09,330
Oh no.

2030
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:14,450
Corpse Party on Yume Nikki Bros.

2031
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:16,970
Corpse Party on which platform?

2032
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:20,550
Okay, I didn't play the original PC-98 one, if that's what you're asking.

2033
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:22,610
But I played the...

2034
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:25,410
Oh gosh.

2035
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:27,670
Uh...

2036
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:29,810
Uh...

2037
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:30,730
What's it called?

2038
01:45:31,090 --> 01:45:31,550
Hold on.

2039
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:33,870
Um...

2040
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,550
Corpse Party...

2041
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:36,730
PSP?

2042
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:39,290
Was it that one?

2043
01:45:40,410 --> 01:45:41,570
Like I played...

2044
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:44,270
Oh.

2045
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:45,890
Which one?

2046
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:48,270
I did play Book of Shadows.

2047
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,210
Do I remember much of Book of Shadows?

2048
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:50,770
I don't.

2049
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,770
Hold on.

2050
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:53,190
I'm researching.

2051
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:55,510
Mhm.

2052
01:45:59,850 --> 01:46:01,710
Oh, why did it go black?

2053
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:02,210
That's weird.

2054
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:06,090
The one...

2055
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:07,610
Okay, so there's like...

2056
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:08,130
Here.

2057
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:09,770
I'll show you guys.

2058
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:10,090
Okay.

2059
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:15,230
There's...

2060
01:46:16,530 --> 01:46:17,410
Actually, no.

2061
01:46:17,530 --> 01:46:18,210
I'm pretty sure.

2062
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:19,410
I think actually...

2063
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:19,630
No.

2064
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:22,110
I...

2065
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:23,550
There's this art one.

2066
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:25,750
Of...

2067
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:26,590
For...

2068
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:28,050
Why did I just open that?

2069
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:33,290
There's this art.

2070
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:35,370
For Corpse Party.

2071
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:37,810
And then there was the original art.

2072
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:39,910
But I played this one.

2073
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:41,850
Now that I think about it.

2074
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,470
I did not play the original art one.

2075
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:45,450
Which was this one.

2076
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:46,930
Which is so peak.

2077
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:48,190
Look at that.

2078
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:52,110
Look at that.

2079
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:53,330
It's so good.

2080
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:55,530
Yeah, yeah.

2081
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:56,530
So the PSP one.

2082
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:56,910
Yeah, yeah.

2083
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:57,290
Okay, okay.

2084
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:58,630
I thought it was the PSP one.

2085
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,970
Look at how peak that is.

2086
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:02,430
It's so good.

2087
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:06,430
Memories.

2088
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:10,410
But I think I watched a playthrough of that one.

2089
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:10,810
Maybe.

2090
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:13,750
Because the art is just too good.

2091
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:17,070
Anyway, yeah.

2092
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:20,370
Obligatory butter up my pooper reference.

2093
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:20,770
Yep.

2094
01:47:20,770 --> 01:47:23,000
That's the game where butter up my pooper came from.

2095
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:31,530
Sometimes localization really just hits in the right way.

2096
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:33,290
Don't you think?

2097
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:35,230
Anyway.

2098
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:38,090
This is Flynn.

2099
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:40,070
It's a bit of a shorter stream.

2100
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:41,750
Actually, it's a much short stream.

2101
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:44,010
Not even two hour stream.

2102
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:46,150
Let me put on some music.

2103
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:48,020
Since we're just kind of talking in the...

2104
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:49,780
Talking in the...

2105
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:51,300
In the...

2106
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,020
In the...

2107
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:54,480
Silence.

2108
01:47:59,400 --> 01:47:59,780
BGM.

2109
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:00,500
There it is.

2110
01:48:04,670 --> 01:48:06,090
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

2111
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:07,350
We could go to the cafe.

2112
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:07,850
You wanna go?

2113
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:16,310
We can go for a little bit.

2114
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:17,590
I'll hit two hours.

2115
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:19,430
I'll hit two hours.

2116
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2117
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:53,330
You deserve a break after all that lifeline.

2118
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:55,070
I know.

2119
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,270
I was like, you know...

2120
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:58,110
That's why, again, I was just like, I'll do the demo.

2121
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:00,730
Because I will be able to...

2122
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:01,550
Say, hey.

2123
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:03,030
Stop.

2124
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:05,570
After this amount of time.

2125
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:09,810
Book of Shadows was the point and click one, right?

2126
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:16,260
Was there point and click?

2127
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:17,380
Yes.

2128
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:19,320
It was like mostly visual novel.

2129
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,160
Oh gosh, it's been so long I don't remember.

2130
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:27,440
Right eye.

2131
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:28,080
Left eye.

2132
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:28,960
Red stomach.

2133
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:30,300
Red eye.

2134
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,440
I think, I think...

2135
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,100
Those phrases will be stuck in my brain for a whole eternity.

2136
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,560
If you don't mind us asking, what's the story behind Punishment?

2137
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:46,050
Um...

2138
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:48,390
If I tell you, I'll have to kill you.

2139
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:52,830
Do you really wanna know?

2140
01:49:52,830 --> 01:49:59,390
Do you really wanna know the story behind Punishment?

2141
01:50:04,410 --> 01:50:05,810
Yes?

2142
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:07,670
Yes?

2143
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:10,530
Okay.

2144
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:12,750
Um...

2145
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:13,690
Oops.

2146
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:18,810
I...

2147
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:21,150
Felt like it.

2148
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:25,090
That's it.

2149
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:26,790
Yeah.

2150
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,100
I've said...

2151
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:40,300
I've said, I wanna make a Metal Gear reference on my profile.

2152
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:42,560
But what can I do?

2153
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:47,200
And I was just like, I feel if I say naked mint, it's kinda weird.

2154
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,440
Hot dog.

2155
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,800
Oh, Bloodstained, yeah!

2156
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,420
Pepman, we talked about that earlier.

2157
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,120
Oh, thank you for the donut.

2158
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:58,720
Um, I was like, if I put like naked mint, it might be kinda weird.

2159
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,100
And solid mint.

2160
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,120
I was just like...

2161
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:02,860
Unfortunately.

2162
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:05,820
For like...

2163
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:06,800
Metal Gear.

2164
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,380
Venom is just so recognizable.

2165
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,320
Even though he's not even my favorite guy.

2166
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:15,460
But Punished Snake is like...

2167
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:16,060
Everybody...

2168
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:17,780
You've seen that and you're just like, oh yeah.

2169
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:19,380
That guy is Punished Snake.

2170
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,780
Especially in photos and everything too.

2171
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:28,860
I love coming back to big head minto.

2172
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:31,560
Big head?

2173
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:38,430
I should've done old mint for authenticity.

2174
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:40,190
Gezora!

2175
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:44,930
Why are you so rude?

2176
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:46,930
I'm gonna...

2177
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:48,130
I'm gonna become...

2178
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:49,330
I'm gonna become...

2179
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:50,770
I'm gonna go goth for that.

2180
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:55,920
Oh, my arms.

2181
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:56,960
Oh my god, that's awkward.

2182
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:57,800
Don't look.

2183
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:00,500
My arms.

2184
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:05,020
Is this Punishment or Punished Mint?

2185
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,000
Then I say yes to both.

2186
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:15,220
Goth.

2187
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:17,620
Goth.

2188
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:19,960
Hold on.

2189
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:23,900
Oh, wrong button.

2190
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:26,020
Dark.

2191
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:27,420
What was I gonna say?

2192
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,060
No, I don't wanna show you guys that yet.

2193
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:32,900
I don't wanna show you that yet.

2194
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,120
There we go.

2195
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:42,420
Minto, will you play Peace Walker PS3 or 360?

2196
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:45,280
Also, do you have any tips for a noob wisp?

2197
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:47,760
Tips?

2198
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,340
Like, ghost tips?

2199
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:52,200
Ghost tricks?

2200
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:54,580
Ghost tips and tricks?

2201
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,920
Oh, I don't know yet actually for Peace Walker.

2202
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,240
What we'll do.

2203
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:05,120
I have to see if 360...

2204
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:05,860
360...

2205
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:07,340
I wanna play on 360.

2206
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:11,140
I have to see if servers and everything are still up.

2207
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:12,740
Ghost trick?

2208
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:20,020
I feel like I should've worn...

2209
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:21,600
I should've been in this mode for...

2210
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,820
for the stream.

2211
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:25,660
Because it's...

2212
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:28,060
It's so much more fitting of the setting.

2213
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:33,100
What about portable ops?

2214
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:35,660
Maybe...

2215
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:36,360
Someday.

2216
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:41,660
Maybe someday I'll play portable ops again.

2217
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,100
Way down in the future.

2218
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,500
Will JP Mint be streaming?

2219
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,360
No, unfortunately.

2220
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:58,820
I'm sorry.

2221
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:01,560
My schedule is becoming more and more packed.

2222
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:05,320
As I get closer.

2223
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,920
So, for those who don't know, I'll be going back to Japan...

2224
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,380
next week.

2225
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,480
And if you're like, But, but you just got back from Japan.

2226
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,620
Well, if you didn't see the cafe announcement...

2227
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:18,160
I'm going for the cafe.

2228
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,220
I got stuff I gotta go film over there.

2229
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:23,420
And...

2230
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:24,860
It just aligns with other stuff.

2231
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,380
Hot dog.

2232
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:29,200
Hot dog.

2233
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:31,920
Minto cute.

2234
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,980
So, and then there's also something else that...

2235
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,480
completely unrelated...

2236
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,900
that might've been added to my schedule, so...

2237
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:43,280
I'm only gonna be there for like a week.

2238
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:46,060
So, I have a lot to do...

2239
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,600
in just that little bit amount of time.

2240
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,320
But, after that...

2241
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,900
After this trip, I won't be going back to Japan...

2242
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:00,360
until a while from now.

2243
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,200
So, you'll have me for a couple months.

2244
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:06,960
Until I have to go back, but...

2245
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,340
I go back for some other cool stuff.

2246
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,220
I go back...

2247
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:13,340
All my Japan trips that I have...

2248
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:18,300
scheduled at the moment are all for work.

2249
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:23,100
So...

2250
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:24,440
You said that before, but okay.

2251
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:25,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2252
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,480
This time, it's true.

2253
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,140
I only have one thing scheduled.

2254
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:33,680
Well, two.

2255
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:35,540
But, yeah.

2256
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:40,680
Your outfit is so cute, just like you are.

2257
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:41,540
Thanks, Rodrigo!

2258
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:51,670
Isn't it a good thing that I'm going to do cool things, right?

2259
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:54,210
And then you can be like...

2260
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:59,110
She's doing that thing!

2261
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:00,530
How exciting!

2262
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,140
But, you know...

2263
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:18,540
And not everything is like the cafe where it's Japan only.

2264
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,060
Wink, wonk.

2265
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,140
Wink, wonk.

2266
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,040
So...

2267
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:27,220
Yeah.

2268
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,520
Busy, busy.

2269
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:32,040
Busy, busy for content.

2270
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:48,930
Have you ever been to an IRL goth maid cafe?

2271
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:52,150
Yes, kind of.

2272
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:53,750
It was like...

2273
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:57,390
Kind of horror-themed, but they were dressed gothy.

2274
01:56:57,670 --> 01:57:00,090
Will you be allowed to take pictures or video of the cafe?

2275
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:02,050
Me or people going?

2276
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:05,010
I...

2277
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:08,630
I'm not quite sure for myself.

2278
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:10,330
I would like to.

2279
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:11,290
I'll try.

2280
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:15,190
But people going, of course, 100% can take...

2281
01:57:15,190 --> 01:57:16,050
Can take...

2282
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:20,150
Photos and video and everything.

2283
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,950
It's the same cafe that...

2284
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:29,110
Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky...

2285
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:36,390
Yeah, the cafe allows it.

2286
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:40,130
I won't be able to go to the cafe, but I hope you have tons of fun in Japan, MitoQ.

2287
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:41,090
Thank you!

2288
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:46,090
It's the same cafe that Ayami Mama did...

2289
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:48,450
She did a collab at last year.

2290
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:50,790
And actually, Kiara went and she took a video.

2291
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:54,130
And it's on her channel as a short.

2292
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:55,930
So if you go to her shorts...

2293
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:56,170
Cute!

2294
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:56,970
Thank you!

2295
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:00,430
If you go to her channel, you can go see it.

2296
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:04,210
I actually took some video, too, of one that I went to last time.

2297
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:05,790
So I might actually edit it.

2298
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:07,790
And then I can...

2299
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:11,030
Last time I went to Japan, Pandomimi...

2300
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:13,970
If you know that artist, she did a collab cafe at the same place.

2301
01:58:15,170 --> 01:58:15,570
And...

2302
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:17,510
I went.

2303
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:19,390
I went on the very last day.

2304
01:58:19,790 --> 01:58:22,410
And so I can probably be like, this is what it's like.

2305
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:25,490
It's not a very big cafe.

2306
01:58:26,090 --> 01:58:26,990
But I don't...

2307
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:29,350
I don't know, honestly, how many people will be going.

2308
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:33,710
There might be reservations required, but...

2309
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:34,290
I was able...

2310
01:58:34,290 --> 01:58:38,890
No, I did have a reservation for that one, but...

2311
01:58:40,190 --> 01:58:44,370
I mean, I'm not super popular in Japan, so...

2312
01:58:45,470 --> 01:58:45,870
So...

2313
01:58:46,430 --> 01:58:48,750
Probably not a ton of people will be going for me.

2314
01:58:51,770 --> 01:58:52,230
But...

2315
01:58:53,450 --> 01:58:54,670
If you decide to go.

2316
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:02,290
So...

2317
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:02,870
We'll see.

2318
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:05,190
Me domito.

2319
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:05,910
That's me.

2320
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:09,110
Sorry I can't go.

2321
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:10,250
Why are you apologizing?

2322
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:13,070
Why are you apologizing?

2323
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:13,990
I'm not...

2324
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:15,790
You can't go to a thing that's in an...

2325
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,750
Probably in an...

2326
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:19,430
Or possibly in an entirely different country than you.

2327
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:20,830
It's very expensive to go.

2328
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:26,610
At that one?

2329
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:30,070
I've only been to Ayami and Panomimin, so...

2330
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:32,770
Only those two that I've been to.

2331
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:35,130
So Ayami.

2332
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,740
Not a lot of people are going to go for me.

2333
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:50,600
Okay, but...

2334
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,620
I said because I'm not popular in Japan.

2335
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:55,060
I do not know.

2336
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,380
Yeah.

2337
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:02,840
So I'll be gone for about a week.

2338
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:04,840
And...

2339
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:07,220
You know, just think of it as like a...

2340
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:10,300
But I probably will do the 24 hour...

2341
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,940
Stream stuff while I'm gone too.

2342
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:18,200
So, you're gonna have that plan if you need any Minto in your background noise.

2343
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,700
Do you just get a reservation off their website?

2344
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:25,080
I've only ever gone to cafes without them.

2345
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:27,700
Yes, I think so.

2346
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,580
I think I got it off their website.

2347
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:30,780
Before.

2348
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:33,100
And it's not like...

2349
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,200
It was pretty easy.

2350
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:36,080
For the... Okay, so...

2351
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:39,800
For Ayami, I didn't have a reservation and I was just able to go.

2352
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:43,960
They do have a kiosk outside of the cafe.

2353
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:47,140
That you can put in like your name and stuff.

2354
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,320
Or you can reserve online.

2355
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:49,960
And...

2356
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:54,480
When I went for Pando Mimi, I reserved online and then I went.

2357
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:56,280
And I like walked inside.

2358
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,440
I was like, hi, I have a reservation.

2359
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,300
And they were like...

2360
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:01,820
They didn't even check it.

2361
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,380
Oh wait, no, they did.

2362
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,440
They did, but they also had like complete tables.

2363
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,040
Or like empty tables.

2364
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:11,020
So, I think I could've just gone in anyway.

2365
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:19,190
What if you had a 24 hour looping stream of raging against Naomi?

2366
02:01:22,070 --> 02:01:24,430
I like ranted for like 5 minutes.

2367
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:26,610
You want that for 24 hours?

2368
02:01:29,490 --> 02:01:29,950
That's...

2369
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:33,410
Sure is weird to apologize for things you don't need to, right?

2370
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,540
I don't wanna hear your sash.

2371
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:41,200
Oh wait, oh my gosh.

2372
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:42,580
What if I make my bangs longer?

2373
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:44,560
Wait, it goes so well with this outfit.

2374
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:48,320
I don't wanna hear your sash.

2375
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:06,460
Going to Japan afterwards, so I can't go.

2376
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:07,680
Have a great trip!

2377
02:02:12,350 --> 02:02:14,970
What about your Lifeline song mix?

2378
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:19,370
If you don't think of something quick, I'm gonna die here!

2379
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:20,190
Die here!

2380
02:02:20,350 --> 02:02:20,950
Die here!

2381
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:22,690
Die here!

2382
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:29,670
Die here!

2383
02:02:32,910 --> 02:02:36,370
Oh man, I hate how much this game has...

2384
02:02:37,390 --> 02:02:41,430
How much we're gonna be referencing this game for a while, I feel.

2385
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:43,810
No!

2386
02:02:45,330 --> 02:02:47,130
Let me forget about it, please.

2387
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:49,850
I already... I'm a ghost.

2388
02:02:49,930 --> 02:02:51,490
I already have so many regrets.

2389
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:54,890
No, I don't regret playing it.

2390
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:55,330
It was fun.

2391
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,990
It was fine.

2392
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:01,390
An instant stream classic.

2393
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:02,130
Unfortunately.

2394
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:04,970
We're trauma-bonded, it's true!

2395
02:03:07,150 --> 02:03:08,350
Oh, it's so true.

2396
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:10,630
Okay guys, I'm Eepy.

2397
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:13,170
I know it's a very short stream today.

2398
02:03:14,590 --> 02:03:15,850
But thank you for a short stream.

2399
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:18,030
We can do short stream every now and then, right?

2400
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:19,950
Especially if I do long stream.

2401
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:27,350
So some people can have something to catch up if they wanna, you know, something short to keep them...

2402
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:29,630
company in the background.

2403
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:34,770
Okay guys, I had fun.

2404
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:39,310
And I will see you guys when I see you next.

2405
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:40,930
Which...

2406
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:43,150
Tomorrow is supposed to be a collab.

2407
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:46,430
But I think Doki is also not feeling well.

2408
02:03:48,070 --> 02:03:50,130
And Lime is not feeling well.

2409
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:51,950
So...

2410
02:03:51,950 --> 02:03:58,410
If both of them are not feeling well tomorrow, Then I will switch Henry Stickmin.

2411
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:03,410
And they said that we'll maybe do it Thursday.

2412
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:05,010
For...

2413
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:06,290
For...

2414
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:07,550
The collab.

2415
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:10,210
So hopefully it will still...

2416
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:14,490
It will still...

2417
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:16,930
Happen this week.

2418
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:19,450
She's playing Marvel Rivals.

2419
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:22,430
I mean, I'm just telling you what she said.

2420
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:24,590
I don't... I don't... I'm not her mom.

2421
02:04:24,710 --> 02:04:26,450
If she's sick, I'm not gonna say...

2422
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:27,610
Hey, stop streaming.

2423
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:30,250
Like, that's... She's an adult.

2424
02:04:30,370 --> 02:04:31,850
She can do whatever the hell she wants.

2425
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:36,490
That's not my business.

2426
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:40,430
But if she feels sick even worse after streaming...

2427
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:42,170
Then...

2428
02:04:42,170 --> 02:04:43,410
I don't know what to tell you.

2429
02:04:45,530 --> 02:04:46,870
I don't know what to tell you.

2430
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:52,740
Hello!

2431
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:53,780

2435
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:01,220
One doll I had as a kid called Mira.

2436
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,960
That my little brother used to be scared of.

2437
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:05,960
One day a bird took her?

2438
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:16,300
What kind of birds do you have in your country?

2439
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:19,140
Doki's unwell.

2440
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:20,460
Doki's playing Marvel Rivals.

2441
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:23,040
