1
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,690
I didn't prepare any background.

2
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,070
I didn't prepare any BGM for this part.

3
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,730
Hey!

4
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,750
Hello!

5
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,590
Welcome to the Void!

6
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,730
Hi!

7
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,410
We are in the Void!

8
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,730
We are in the Void!

9
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,250
Where is the stinky cat?

10
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,870
I kicked her out.

11
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,790
I kicked her out because she is too stinky.

12
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,310
She stinks up the whole room.

13
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,750
Himito, I like your face.

14
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,010
Thanks?

15
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,370
Do you have a pet?

16
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,270
If you have a pet, I like your pet.

17
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,210
It's like when you go to a friend's house.

18
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,330
I only went to one party before.

19
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,430
Like a school party.

20
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,230
I only ever went to one.

21
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,030
They did not have a cat or a dog or anything!

22
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,470
And it was torturous!

23
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,990
It was the worst ever.

24
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,310
But, yeah.

25
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,770
She went to a party?

26
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,510
I know.

27
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,310
I went to one party.

28
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,530
And my friend, she got really drunk and I held her hair while she threw up in the toilet.

29
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,890
And then I was like, I should go home.

30
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,090
So, yeah.

31
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,070
That was time.

32
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,910
Only the one time I ever went to a party.

33
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,450
What's the point of a party if you can't show off your pet?

34
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,950
That's what I'm saying.

35
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,670
I feel like if you host a party, you have to have a pet.

36
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,810
For any introverts that venture onto the premises.

37
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,310
Because, otherwise...

38
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,950
What am I going to do?

39
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,190
Talk to people?

40
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,410
My friend, she was like doing shots.

41
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,450
And I'm like...

42
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,130
You guys want to watch anime?

43
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,270
I think they were playing Smash though and I just watched that.

44
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,810
For like the two hours I was there.

45
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,930
It's my friend Valentine's birthday.

46
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,290
Could I get a happy birthday for him?

47
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,030
Sure!

48
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,690
Also, Andregos, thank you for the 20 gifted.

49
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,110
Valentine, happy birthday!

50
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,790
Happy birthday to you!

51
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,130
Happy birthday to you!

52
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,770
Happy birthday dear Valentine!

53
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,990
Happy birthday to you!

54
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,310
Happy birthday!

55
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,210
Yeah!

56
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,470
So today guys...

57
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:26,570
I have a couple of Playstation demo discs that I'm going to play.

58
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,450
I have two PS1 discs and two...

59
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,210
Originally I thought they were all PS1 discs.

60
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,510
But I have two PS1 and two PS2 discs.

61
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,130
So...

62
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,270
I have several of these.

63
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,470
One of these I like played a ton.

64
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,710
Oh my gosh, I could tell you...

65
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,550
Sorry, I have to explain a little bit.

66
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,250
The stream is kind of my own selfish desire to play the demo of this game.

67
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,010
Because I don't want to play the full game.

68
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,270
I only want to play the demo version again.

69
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,470
Because I loved playing the demo version so much of this one game.

70
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,470
Is it a great game?

71
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,050
No.

72
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,550
But did I love that game?

73
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,730
Yeah, I did.

74
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,010
So, I have that that I'm going to play.

75
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,710
She's going to take us back to the past.

76
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,150
Yeah!

77
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,510
Oh my gosh.

78
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,270
You know, bust out your CRTs.

79
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,630
And get some Pizza Hut.

80
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,410
And tell your friends that this weekend you're going to have a water balloon fight.

81
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,050
You're going to get your Nerf guns.

82
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,890
You're going to go outside.

83
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,630
Oh my gosh.

84
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,910
Things that children don't do anymore.

85
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,610
This OG sign is looking forward to a trip down memory lane.

86
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,090
I remember having MGS1 and Final Fantasy 8 demo discs.

87
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:55,790
Yes!

88
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,310
PlayStation 1 tasting menu, if you will.

89
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,670
Well, two of them are PlayStation 1.

90
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,270
But yes.

91
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,610
And one of them...

92
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,610
One of these I got more recently.

93
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,430
I wonder why.

94
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,340
One of these I got more recently.

95
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,640
But when we get to there...

96
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,180
You'll of course know why.

97
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,380
And then...

98
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,100
Hold

99
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,330
on.

100
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,350
When I was going through...

101
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,270
I have all my games on a shelf.

102
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,250
And when I was going through everything, I was like...

103
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,950
I didn't even remember...

104
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,390
I knew I had...

105
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,470
When I saw this disc, I was like...

106
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,370
Oh my gosh.

107
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,970
I remember this.

108
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,050
And that's when I was just like...

109
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,490
Wait, this is PlayStation 2 though.

110
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,590
So...

111
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,750
That's when I was like...

112
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,760
I don't have just only PlayStation 1...

113
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,210
Demo discs.

114
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,130
I also have this PlayStation 2 one.

115
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,630
And then also...

116
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,030
I have the Holiday 2004 demo disc.

117
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,020
Which if you are not aware...

118
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,130
I am aware.

119
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,170
Don't worry.

120
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,780
The Holiday 2004 demo disc for the PlayStation 2...

121
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,250
Has a...

122
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,730
A little bit of a bug on it.

123
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,790
Where if you play one of the games called Beautiful Joe 2...

124
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,910
It will wipe your entire memory card.

125
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,770
So we are just not gonna touch that one.

126
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,610
But I was so shocked that I...

127
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,150
Actually, I don't remember playing this one so much.

128
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,730
And the other one, I have no idea what's on it.

129
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,850
So when we get to it, we'll get to it.

130
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,610
Actually...

131
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,630
No, yeah.

132
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,070
Only this one.

133
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,190
I'm purposefully not saying the name of it yet.

135
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,550
Since I want it to be a surprise, I don't want to say the name of it.

136
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,990
And then someone will be like...

137
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,870
That CD has...

138
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,450
Schmitty's Grand Adventure.

139
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,890
The best game ever.

140
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,310
You know?

141
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,670
I want it to be a surprise.

142
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,050
Yeah.

143
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,630
And then of course...

144
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,610
Oh my gosh, I'm excited for the Holiday demo disc.

145
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,630
I don't remember ever playing this one.

146
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,610
This might be...

147
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,490
I don't think this is mine.

148
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,770
I might have acquired this from...

149
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,190
My sister's boyfriend.

150
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,030
Because I don't think my dad ever played this either.

151
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,350
My dad was not a PlayStation person.

152
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,610
He was a PC person.

153
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,330
I guess it's yours now.

154
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,250
I guess it's mine now.

155
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,350
Well, you know...

156
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,450
I was about to say something so bad.

157
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,770
But this other one...

158
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,350
I don't remember what's on it.

159
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,230
I'm very excited.

160
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,090
Hopefully...

161
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,770
These discs are scratched to hell and back.

162
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,350
So hopefully we don't have...

163
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,630
Very many problems.

164
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,730
Hopefully.

165
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:18,870
Hopefully.

166
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,190
Well, not technically a demo disc in the traditional sense.

167
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,630
When I remember a demo of Star Wars Battlefront 2 on the second disc of Revenge of the Sith DVD.

168
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,510
Wow!

169
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,830
Had to load it on the OG Xbox.

170
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,350
That's so awesome!

171
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,170
I wish...

172
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,470
I wish we had more demos and games.

173
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,970
I guess we don't really...

174
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,190
I still like buying physical media.

175
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:46,970
So...

176
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,730
You know, I think it's like...

177
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,190
I guess kind of a lost art.

178
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,870
And you know, you can...

179
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,150
Demo things sometimes on...

180
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,270
Like, you know, Steam will have like free demos.

181
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,910
Or some stuff like that.

182
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,910
But there's always just like...

183
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,010
A...

184
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,610
It's...

185
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,690
There's some sort of excitement when you receive something.

186
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,150
And it's not something you picked out.

187
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,650
You know what I mean?

188
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,030
Like...

189
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,110
If I go to Steam right now and I download the demo for a game.

190
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,110
I found the game and I saw it after...

191
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,730
You know, the demo.

192
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:20,610
Right?

193
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,470
So it's a little different.

194
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,550
Whereas, if I were to get a demo disc.

195
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,070
I have no idea what's on it.

196
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,270
And so...

197
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,130
I'm gonna be like...

198
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,370
Wow!

199
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,850
This is...

200
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,650
This game that I didn't expect I would like.

201
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,210
Is actually so awesome!

202
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,450
So...

203
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,410
You know, I'm very excited to try this out.

204
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,370
And kind of go down memory lane with you guys.

205
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,590
Totally agree.

206
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,090
Yeah!

207
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,110
It's fun, right?

208
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,430
So let's be boomers today and...

209
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,830
Have a fun time.

210
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,650
Let me start up...

211
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:55,810
Okay.

212
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,990
The first one that we're doing is the one that I mentioned earlier.

213
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,270
Which is like the one that I played a ton of.

214
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,770
Oh my god, I played...

215
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,030
I even still...

216
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:11,170
I still have the little paper case that it came in.

217
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,850
I treasured this demo disc, okay?

218
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,210
I don't think you guys understand.

219
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,670
Like, I...

220
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,970
I actually liked it so much.

221
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,230
I still have it, like...

222
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,170
You know...

223
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,570
So, I don't even know where I got this from though.

224
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,390
I don't know if it was from a magazine.

225
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,690
I know some people said they got stuff from...

226
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,170
Got discs from Pizza Hut back in the day, but...

227
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,170
I don't remember ever getting a Pizza Hut one.

228
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,650
Demo discs are like a box of chocolates.

229
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,070
You never know what you're gonna get.

230
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,530
PC magazine or Sony magazine?

231
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,630
I do have a...

232
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,850
Not PC, sorry.

233
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,450
P...

234
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:58,970
Wait, no.

235
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,330
I have one from...

236
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,050
PlayStation magazine.

237
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,490
Yeah.

238
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,770
And I think all of these go...

239
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,110
Let's see.

240
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,070
I have one that goes...

241
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,390
What's on this one?

242
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,390
Oh no, I'm not gonna look.

243
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,310
I only know one game that's on this one.

244
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,330
Am I making it too obvious?

245
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,130
Okay, I'm gonna start my PlayStation now.

246
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,360
I was having some issue with the sound earlier, so...

247
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,480
Ah!

248
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,860
Good, good, good, good.

249
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,260
Yay!

250
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,460
Yay!

251
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,760
Wait, it's in there, right?

252
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,940
Oh boy!

253
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,780
Oh my gosh, it's so...static-y.

254
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,620
Oh my God.

255
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,620
Wow!

256
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,800
I've been cho...

257
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,040
Chosen?

258
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,840
Wow!

259
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,580
The PlayStation Underground.

260
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,000
Wow!

261
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh my God.

262
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,140
I've been chosen.

263
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,480
I can't read anything.

264
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,900
Experience the PlayStation Underground CD magazine.

265
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,640
2 CDs per issue.

266
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,880
4 issues a year.

267
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,200
8 discs with playable demos.

268
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,720
Oh my God.

269
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,100
Interviews with the game makers.

270
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,220
Behind the scenes of PlayStation events.

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,960
Hints, downloadable codes and more.

272
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,780
Hints and codes?

273
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,880
Be the first to get information on the next generation of PlayStation.

274
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,820
And see what you've only been hearing about.

275
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,980
Is that sad?

276
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,540
Finally, a magazine that doesn't make you read.

277
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,400
Everything is so crunchy.

278
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,940
Call 1-800-983-SONY.

279
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,580
I can call Mr. Sony?

280
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,660
No way.

281
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,180
I can call Mr. Sony!

282
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,700
As a PlayStation Underground member, you now have access to all the inside information on Gamer Kadrima.

00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,900
Guys, we're in.

285
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,280
I don't think I ever got these issues.

286
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,920
I think...

287
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,900
I think this was a gift from somebody for Christmas or something for me.

288
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,360
Yeah!

289
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,420
Welcome to PlayStation Underground TM.

00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,740

MLB 2000.

MLB 2000.

295
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,190
This is the one I wanted to play!

296
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,870
Disney's The Emperor's New Groove.

297
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,030
The video game!

298
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,230
Yay!

299
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,030
Okay, first... Okay, you only play... That's the last level that you play, is the one in the jungle.

300
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,870
But the first one you play is in the village.

301
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,690
And then you go to my favorite part, which is the rollercoaster.

302
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,430
And then you go to the third level, which is that, which is the jungle.

303
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,670
But my favorite is the rollercoaster.

304
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:24,690
Spoilers.

305
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:24,870
Spoilers.

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,450

Jarrett and LeBont Stock Car Racing.

309
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:49,000
What is with like the strange typefacing on the... Why is it so... There's such strange spaces here.

310
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,160
Yeah, MediEvil.

311
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,980
I actually never played the original MediEvil.

312
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,560
And I never played MediEvil 2 fully, but I played the heck out of this demo.

313
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,440
And it also scared me a lot.

314
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,440
Sydney 2000.

315
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,760
I didn't play most of these.

316
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,700
Okay, I also never played the Spider-Man one.

317
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,780
Well, I say never.

318
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,760
I did not play Spider-Man very much.

319
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,300
NFL Game Day 2001.

320
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,620

No way.

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,650
The Legend of Dragoon.

324
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,990
Wait, Dragoon is trademarked.

325
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,610
Jokeyboon.

326
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,790
I think you better be careful.

327
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,780
Threads.

328
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,880
What was this one?

329
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,420
Why does that look like Lara Croft?

330
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,100
Well, yeah, there's a good amount of...

331
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,180
Good amount of variety.

332
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,200
There's too many sports.

333
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,460
Too many sports in this one.

334
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,180
I'm complaining.

335
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,720
I'm calling Sony right now and I'm complaining.

336
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,140
Too many sports.

337
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,820
Boo sports.

338
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,080
I didn't really play any of the sports ones.

339
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,800
Oh my gosh, I want to play this one.

340
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,520
Oh my gosh.

341
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,300
I'm not going to start with this one.

342
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,640
I will... Okay, actually maybe I will.

343
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,580
I'll play up until the end of... We don't have to play this level.

344
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,840
I can play up to like the end of the...

345
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,120
The end of the...

346
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,140
Rollercoaster.

347
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,280
Okay, sorry.

348
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,660
Wow!

349
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,240
Okay.

350
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,360
Okay.

351
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,520
Just noticing that... Hold on.

352
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,700
My thing is a little off.

353
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Hold on, I'm going to do this.

354
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,860
I'll just go widescreen.

355
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,180
Thank you.

356
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,900
Sorry that some of the text was cut off.

357
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,360
There we go.

358
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,540
I'll just go... Actually, I'll just go smaller.

359
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,140
There we go.

360
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,740
Okay.

361
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,680
There we go.

362
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,060
There we go.

363
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,840
It looks better?

364
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,240
Cool.

365
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,940
Rating pending.

366
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,640
Oh, what do you think they're going to rate this?

367
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,580
The Emperor's New Groove video game.

368
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
What do you think?

369
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,560
What do you think they'll rate this?

370
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,420
Em...

371
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,460
Empermita!

372
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,840
Wait, okay.

373
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,020
L2, R2 is move camera.

374
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,200
L1, rotate camera.

375
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,460
I didn't press anything.

376
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,100
Did it send me back?

377
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Oh.

378
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,380
It was like, hey gamer, what are you doing?

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,380
You got to press the button.

380
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,040
Gamer!

381
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,900
Frontal kick and pick up and release pots.

382
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,820
Turned him into a llama.

383
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,480
Funniest thing I've ever seen.

384
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,880
Says the alpaca.

385
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,440
Okay, you know what?

386
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,140
We'll figure it out.

387
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,420
We're gamers.

388
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh my gosh, PlayStation demo is loading.

389
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,040
This is crazy.

390
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,720
Can you play as Kronk?

391
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:29,940
No.

392
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,520
No, but you can see his pregnant wife.

393
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,640
Oh my god, we're just watching the movie!

394
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,200
Oh my god!

395
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,360
The groove.

396
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,140
I'm sorry, but you threw off the Emperor's groove.

397
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,700
I'm sorry!

398
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,600
I'm sorry!

399
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,920
Oh wow!

400
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,200
Oh my god!

401
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,400
Llama!

402
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,760
Oh my god, Kronk!

403
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,700
I love this movie.

404
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,440
Demon Llama!

405
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,620
Yeah, there should be no DMCA, right?

406
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,280
It's like watching a trailer.

407
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,680
Probably.

408
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,960
Oh no.

409
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,460
Oh no.

410
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,080
Guys, don't worry so much about it.

411
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,520
It's okay.

412
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,340
Oh my god, this is like the longest trailer ever.

413
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,340
They're just spoiling the whole movie.

414
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,760
Oh my...

415
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,060
How silly.

416
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,200
Oh my god!

417
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,120
Bad Llama?

418
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,240
Why is he so...

419
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,840
This too is Yaoi.

420
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:17,940
Yaoi.

421
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,840
Kuzco is always just a little like...

422
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,820
I know what you are, Kuzco.

423
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,220
Do you ship them?

424
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,880
No, that would be NTR.

425
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,600
He has a pregnant wife.

426
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,100
We can't do this.

427
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,260
Look at me and my bathtub.

428
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,120
Doom Yaoi.

429
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,120
It's so sad.

430
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,840
I can't even read the copyright.

431
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,820
It's so crunchy.

432
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,480
Bring it on.

433
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,520
In theaters?

434
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,040
I don't think I saw it in theaters.

435
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,640
I don't know when I saw this movie.

436
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,640
2,024 years ago.

437
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,900
Craziness, huh?

438
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,100
Disney Interactive.

439
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,920
Do they still call themselves that?

440
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,060
Disney Interactive?

441
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,820
Argonaut.

442
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,200
I get it.

443
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,260
I get it.

444
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,460
Did you know Kuzco's name in the first draft of the script had to be changed when Japanese localizers pointed out them?

445
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,370
No way.

446
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:52,650
Seriously?

447
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,230
Oh my god.

448
00:25:59,230 --> 00:25:59,710
Guys.

449
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,190
Slideshow.

450
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,510
What the hell is this?

451
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,390
Maybe I shouldn't have clicked it.

452
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,590
Oh.

453
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:11,030
Emperor Kuzco having turned into a llama may have serious implications on his plans for Kuzcotopia.

454
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:12,950
Pacha.

455
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,470
A lowly peasant.

456
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,330
Strong, honest, faithful.

457
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,190
But most of all, he has no fear of talking llamas.

458
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,810
Continue.

459
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,250
Press X to continue.

460
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,070
Oh.

461
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:25,890
Kronk.

462
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,550
Yzma's devoted partner.

463
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,770
He's not very smart, but he can do great things with spinach puffs.

464
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,810
Yzma.

465
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,470
Kuzco's mutinous aide.

466
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,410
Her single aim is to get rid of Kuzco and take the throne for herself.

467
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,850
If only she could master those transformation potions.

468
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,290
Press X to continue.

469
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,690
Oh my god.

470
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,690
Tipo and Chaka.

471
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,250
Who the hell are these guys?

472
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,430
Oh, they're the kids.

473
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,790
Can their father, Pacha, save the village from Kuzcotopia?

474
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,190
Helping the emperor may be the only way.

475
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,950
Only together can this unlikely alliance save the day.

476
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,570
Kuzco and Pacha must defeat Yzma, save the village, and find the antidote to restore the emperor to the throne.

477
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,410
I like how it has to like... reset every time.

478
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:16,670
Oh.

479
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,250
Oh my god.

480
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,150
Yo, we're zooming there.

481
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,910
Oh my god.

482
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,770
Guys, we have to collect all the coins.

483
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,790
Wow, the village.

484
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,690
Chapter 1.

485
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,760
Wow, they're showing us the whole place.

486
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,200
What are these?

487
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,300
Oh, I can't get these yet.

488
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,460
Hey there, buddy.

489
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,800
Let's go.

490
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,420
I want to get away from this village, out of this body, and back to my palace so I can build Kuzcotopia.

491
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,280
I can't show you the way out of the village unless you build Kuzcotopia somewhere else.

492
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,180
I don't make deals with peasants.

493
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,060
Damn.

494
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,400
Then I guess I can't take you back.

495
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,800
Fine, I'll find my own way back.

496
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,280
No, it's far too dangerous.

497
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
Just wander around by my hut.

498
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,620
I've placed rocks and pebbles to show where the lethal...

499
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,900
The lethal drops?

500
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,800
What does that mean?

501
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,800
Why is he like...

502
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,880
La la la, not listening.

503
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,240
And don't take the villagers' coins.

504
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,280
The villagers are my people, so those are my coins.

505
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,500
He's so real for this.

506
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,820
What do you mean by the lethal drops?

507
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,640
Oh my gosh.

508
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,100
Oh god, the camera.

509
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,600
I can't help but take your money if you're just gonna...

510
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,980
If you're just gonna leave it by the cliff.

511
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,660
Maybe put it in your pocket.

512
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,900
Oh my gosh, the camera is whack, you guys.

513
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,540
I think these are for later.

514
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,780
Can I go inside?

515
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:03,960
No.

516
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,300
Do a flip.

517
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,580
Let's take this kid's money.

518
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,540
Oh hey kid.

519
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,040
By pressing your action button, you can smash these red pots.

520
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,320
Good, I feel like smashing something.

521
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,380
Guys, smash or pass?

522
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,740
Hell yeah.

523
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,120
Did I get all of these coins here?

524
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,780
I think so.

525
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,140
Is there anything up top here?

526
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,660
No.

527
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,160
There's an annoying kid though.

528
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,480
Oh, he's running around.

529
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,020
Can I help you kid?

530
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,860
Wow, this is actually... Oh my god, the lag.

531
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,720
I feel like this could look worse, right?

532
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,080
I feel like this could...

533
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,900
look worse.

534
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
The lag is real.

535
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,820
How did I deal with it?

536
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,140
This is a secret.

537
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,540
Guys, I remember.

538
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,260
I'm also killing...

539
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,820
I didn't want to...

540
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,960
Oh my gosh, I already lost a life?

541
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,680
Oh shoot.

542
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,640
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

543
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,580
Karma?

544
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
I'm the emperor.

545
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,920
There's no karma.

546
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,260
Oh wait, this is the checkpoint.

547
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,100
I should have done that before.

548
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,400
You think I got... Wait, you think I got all these coins before?

549
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,740
Oh yeah, I have 10.

550
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,760
Let's go back in.

551
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,720
What if they're like... I don't know.

552
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,740
Evil or something.

553
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,740
And it refilled our life.

554
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,040
Perfect.

555
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,320
Guys, do you think we should play this?

556
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,280
Do you think this is gonna be game of the year?

557
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,140
In 2001?

558
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,500
Pinto, it's my birthday today!

559
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,400
But I'm stuck at work.

560
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:21,880
Lava!

561
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,240
Oh my gosh, perfect game for you.

562
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,980
That's okay, because I'm getting a tattoo of Fossful Light from Hosekin Okunidan over the weekend.

563
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,900
Thank you for the Hoka Super!

564
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,800
Happy birthday!

565
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Happy birthday to you!

566
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,820
Happy birthday to you!

567
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,300
Happy birthday, Oshama Llama!

568
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,660
Happy birthday to you!

569
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,900
I hope your tattoo doesn't hurt too bad.

570
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,800
What did he mean by the lethal point?

571
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,680
Still a little concerned about...

572
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,420
I think he needs to explain that better, you know?

573
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,820
Oh my god, there's parkour.

574
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,040
Parkour.

575
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,740
Checkpoint!

576
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,180
Nice.

577
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,960
What the heck is this?

578
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,540
This pad raises the columns to form steps.

579
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,160
Once they're triggered, you better be quick before they lower again.

580
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,120
Ever thought of making them stay up for good when you press the pad?

581
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,200
Bushing?

582
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,380
Don't tell me.

583
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,140
You've got the brains in the family.

584
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,680
Okay, hold on.

585
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,740
We're so good.

586
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,560
Oh, I think this is if I need health.

587
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,520
Game of the Year is the same year FGS2 came out.

588
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,120
Okay, when you put it like that...

589
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,120
Okay, when you put it like that...

590
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,820
I mean...

591
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,120
I mean, when you put it like that...

592
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,120
To open some village doors, you have to put a pot on a pad.

593
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,780
Llamas pick up pots by pressing their action button.

594
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,900
How did you get here so fast?

595
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,520
Hey, it's a game!

596
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,140
Don't get cocky, kid.

597
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,170
Nice.

598
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:29,130
My personal vote for 2001 Game of the Year is this little indie game called Halo Combat Evolved.

599
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,350
Guys, did you see how many things Astro Bot was nominated for?

600
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,930
Astro Bot sweep?

601
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,350
Except they'll probably win none of them, but that's okay.

602
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,950
This could be Metal Gear Solid 2, I'm just saying.

603
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,970
To charge, press your charge button.

604
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,350
When you're running, collect llama potions to replenish your red charge bar.

605
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,350
A lethal drop means...

606
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,690
A lethal fall from a high place.

607
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,430
Like you dropping from the cliff earlier.

608
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,370
No, I get that.

609
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,330
But like...

610
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,610
What the hell?

611
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,470
Like, why do they have that?

612
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,210
You'll never catch me!

613
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,770
You're really gonna make me do this, aren't you?

614
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,770
Oh, I have to beat up this kid.

615
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,150
Oh shoot.

616
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,710
Oh my god, he just fell from the lethal... Oh, never mind.

617
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:25,860
Okay.

618
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,080
Guys, I got this.

619
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,080
Where did he go?

620
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,000
Oh my god, the lag.

621
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,900
We got this.

622
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,040
Oh my god, I feel like I'm playing Spyro right now.

623
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,240
I gotta...

624
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,440
Oh my god.

625
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,820
Okay, we got this.

626
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,060
I'm gonna kick this kid's ass!

627
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,800
This kid is besting me!

628
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,860
This kid is one-upping me right now.

629
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,740
You guys!

630
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:52,760
Okay, hold on.

631
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,460
We're gonna catch him.

632
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,000
Right now!

633
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,460
Come on, kid!

634
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,700
Where am

635
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
I?

636
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,100
Oh, I'm here.

637
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,460
Oh, there's a checkpoint right here.

638
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Let's kick this kid's ass.

639
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm hearing the Emperor's, Lion's and Snake's voice.

640
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,240
And it surprisingly fits.

641
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,220
I remember playing this game when I was younger.

642
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,620
The dialogue voiceover was hilarious.

643
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,320
Wait, since this is a demo, it has no voiceover?

644
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,180
But the actual one had the voiceover?

645
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,700
Okay, let's get him from the opposite side.

646
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,240
Yeah, kid!

647
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,980
I kicked his ass!

648
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,260
Hey, you've broken my toy llama!

649
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,420
Here, just take my red idol and leave me alone.

650
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,020
So long, kid.

651
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,360
It does work.

652
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,540
Voiceover takes up a lot of disk space.

653
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,900
That makes sense.

654
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,900
God, he really starts like...

655
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,740
Yeah, I'm a bully to that children.

656
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,080
Hello?

657
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,020
Red idol.

658
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,680
Wait, did I grab it?

659
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,880
Maybe I didn't grab it.

660
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,360
Oh, I didn't even take it.

661
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,600
Use red Cusco idols on red Cusco doors.

662
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,060
We're doomed now.

663
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,820
Oh my goodness.

664
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,220
The render distance is something, huh?

665
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,380
Why are there giant mushrooms here?

666
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,140
Why are there giant mushrooms here?

667
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,380
Are we not...

668
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,200
Wait, huh?

669
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,560
Hey Pacha, don't you ever do any work?

670
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,520
He's so rude!

671
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,140
Cusco, stay away from this ancient tree.

672
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,000
It's very fragile.

673
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,380
That's why we wrote an X on it.

674
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,800
You mean rotten.

675
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,200
It's just old, so leave it alone.

676
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,560
Maybe I will.

677
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,840
Maybe I won't.

678
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,960
Just don't charge around by the tree, okay?

679
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,660
What?

680
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,240
What does that mean?

681
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,270
Why does it have a giant X on it then, Pacha?

682
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,390
Oopsie.

683
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,170
My bad.

684
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,350
I'm just a llama.

685
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,230
Ris...

686
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,350
Ris...

687
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,690
Ris...

688
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,610
Ris...

689
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:07,930
Okay.

690
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,910
Oh gosh.

691
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,330
Alright, very carefully.

692
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,730
Very carefully.

693
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,810
Nice, okay.

694
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,140
That looks like a secret.

695
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,040
If we charge...

696
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,400
And jump!

697
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,820
Maybe there is another way to open.

698
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,300
Oh wait.

699
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,240
Oh, is this the same thing?

700
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
No, this looks like a different area.

701
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,180
Hold on, let's talk to the girl.

702
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,700
Hello little miss.

703
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,120
In this area you will find a Whompie.

704
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,280
My Whompie!

705
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,460
A Whompie is a continue.

706
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,700
If you have a Whompie when you die, you will replay from your last checkpoint.

707
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,260
Kid, how do you know all this?

708
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,380
Beats me.

709
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,700
Aliens are like...

710
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,660
Just...

711
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,500
Oh, I see it!

712
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,000
Aliens are like implanting the information in her brain.

713
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,960
Wait, okay.

714
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,610
Alright.

715
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,870
Alright.

716
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,690
Wait, what the hell is this supposed to...

717
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:35,990
Oh.

718
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,890
Okay, I think I'm supposed to...

719
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,110
Go on this?

720
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,130
Oh, they like magically appear!

721
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,730
This place is kinda wack.

722
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,470
Oh my god.

723
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,910
Oh gosh, parkour in this.

724
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,630
The fourth wall.

725
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,690
No, don't worry about it.

726
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,650
Don't worry about it.

727
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,950
We gotta get the Whompie, you guys.

728
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,130
Nice.

729
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,190
Whompie!

730
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,750
Oh, oh my gosh.

731
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,400
Got one Whompie.

732
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Oh my god, why did they put it back over...

733
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,400
To go back you have to go over the ledge?

734
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,360
It's so evil!

735
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,180
That's so evil.

736
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,740
What the hell?

737
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,970
And I don't even keep the Whompie!

738
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,660
This sucks.

739
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,720
You don't even...

740
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,140
What's the point of grabbing the Whompie?

741
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,800
What's the point of grabbing the Whompie if you don't even get to keep it?

742
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,640
Wait.

743
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,880
Oh, oh.

744
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,880
I think I didn't...

745
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,700
Hey Minto, hello!

746
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,300
There we go.

747
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,740
We don't have time for you Whompie.

748
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,800
Hey kid.

749
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,260
Humans can look around by moving their head, but I think llamas have to use triangle.

750
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,680
Don't you have anything better to do?

751
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,860
Use your look button to see the red idol at the top of the statue.

752
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,180
That's not, that's not an answer.

753
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,640
Little kid.

754
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,200
Little kid, that's not an answer.

755
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,180
What's this guy?

756
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,980
What are you doing?

757
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,980
The wrong button.

758
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,700
Nice.

759
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,040
What's old man Jenkins doing?

760
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,980
Is he supposed to be an enemy?

761
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,640
Do I kill him?

762
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,240
Please unlock the full game for the Whompie.

763
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,400
No, I think...

764
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,340
I think I could've used the Whompie, but I also...

765
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,000
Don't feel like dying.

766
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,960
Why is it so evil?

767
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,100
Why is the, why are the platforms above like the...

768
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,120
Oh my gosh, an extra life.

769
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,840
Why are they above the ledge?

770
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,560
It's so evil.

771
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,480
Yeah.

772
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,840
What's this guy even here for?

773
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,300
To make it seem like there's actually people inhabiting this world?

774
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,800
Can I kill him?

775
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,060
I'm an evil llama now.

776
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,340
And then this giant ass flower for no reason.

777
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,640
It's kind of crazy your stamina doesn't replenish.

778
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,780
Charge him?

779
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,160
I tried, it didn't do anything.

780
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,900
Demonic llama.

781
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,220
Where are we going?

782
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,880
Oh, 44 out of 50.

783
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,800
Secrets 1 out of 2.

784
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,420
We know where the other secret was.

785
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,540
But I didn't feel like getting it.

786
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,660
The Whompie.

787
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,080
Alright guys, I have to lock in now.

788
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,120
I have to lock in for the catacombs.

789
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,860
Yeah!

790
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,560
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

791
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,600
Oh my god.

792
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,300
Yeah!

793
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,220
I used to play this one chapter for hours.

794
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,860
I can't even express to you.

795
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,460
Oh my gosh.

796
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,520
Oh my god.

797
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,170
Oh my god, I'm locked in.

798
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,070
I'm so locked in right now.

799
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,200
I'm locked in.

800
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,640
I missed the Whompie.

801
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,400
Sorry.

802
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,160
Guys,

803
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,420
I was not locked in enough.

804
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,510
I was not locked in enough.

805
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,350
I totally had that though.

806
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,130
That's so messed up.

807
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:29,950
Oh my gosh.

808
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:30,410
My bad.

809
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,480
Why is it that the sound is so horrible?

810
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,280
I forgot how squeaky and terrible the sound.

811
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,400
Maybe we should go for the Whompie.

812
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,460
Sorry, I missed it again.

813
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,980
We're good!

814
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,460
Yeah!

815
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,280
I almost got every coin.

816
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,380
That's the one level I would do so much.

817
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,930
I think it was even muscle memory.

818
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,610
I think it's like burned into my ectoplasm.

819
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,010
Shame the Disney Metal Gear Solid crossover.

820
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,110
I hear this is one of the better Disney games on the Playstation 1.

821
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:48,670
Do you agree?

822
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,870
I didn't play anything else so I honestly don't know.

823
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,550
Then you go to the jungle, which I don't really like this level so...

824
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,110
There's like this little spider.

825
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,510
There's like the spiders and stuff.

826
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,170
You like Disney's Vampire Zoo group?

827
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:15,630
Yes.

828
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,130
Help me!

829
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,410
Help me!

830
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:22,750
Who's there?

831
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:23,750
I can't see.

832
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,050
It's getting dark.

833
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,230
Save yourself!

834
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,310
The pain!

835
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,970
Oh my gosh, Metal Gear!

836
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,090
Avenge my life, buddy!

837
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,970
To kill a spider, use your roller charge to flip the spider onto its back and then jump attack its belly.

838
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,930
Ah ok, that was the freakiest thing I've ever seen.

839
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,620
I don't like this level very much.

840
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,820
Where are the spiders anyway?

841
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,360
Hey spiders, where are you at?

842
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,510
Damn, he's got moves.

843
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:10,790
I think if I press this we can leave.

844
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:11,450
Ok, perfect.

845
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,470
Discover many other diverse levels seen in the movie.

846
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,850
The treacherous river section.

847
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:17,790
I've never seen that before.

848
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,650
I've never played this game.

849
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:22,750
Where you must guide our heroes through rapids, logs and furious crocodiles.

850
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,350
Sounds horrible.

851
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,990
The mysterious city and palace.

852
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,250
Meet the Incan citizens and solve mind bending puzzles.

853
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,450
I don't feel like doing that.

854
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,290
Oh my gosh, the mountain levels hold...

855
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:36,310
Deep in the catacombs, discover fantastic new transformations.

856
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,290
Including the flying bunny.

857
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,250
Doesn't sound...

858
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:47,650
High above the city in Yzma's lab, battle strange creatures and conquer the incredible 2D platform race to defeat Yzma.

859
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,070
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.

860
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,090
Sir, we're here for just the rollercoaster.

861
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:54,770
Thank you.

862
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:55,570
Yeah, exactly.

863
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,890
I wish the rollercoaster level was like 10 times longer.

864
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,070
I want to play it forever.

865
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,290
I want to play just that level forever.

866
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,390
Graphic design is my passion.

867
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,170
Brought to you by PlayStation Underground.

868
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:21,090
Well guys, we played the only reason I decided to do this stream today.

869
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,130
So what now should we play?

870
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:26,290
I always sucked at this one.

871
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:30,250
Actually I was really... Oh we can do medieval too.

872
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,270
Cinema.

873
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:39,320
I really sucked at this one and I really sucked at...

874
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,210
The skateboard one.

875
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,290
What is Threads?

876
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,610
Can I see what Threads is?

877
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,410
I'm so... I don't remember this at all.

878
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,110
Can I see what Threads is?

879
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:51,270
It's clothes?

880
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,530
Is it like a video?

881
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,040
Looking good is half the battle.

882
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,900
Oh my god.

883
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,300
Wow!

884
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,240
Wow!

885
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,200
Wow!

886
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:11,820
Oh my god!

887
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,320
I can't even tell what these are.

888
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,020
Oh

889
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,350
my gosh, the Gran Turismo jacket is kind of awesome.

890
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,170
I can't... Everything is moving so fast.

891
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,910
I can't see anything.

892
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,150
What is that supposed to be?

893
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,910
Oh, I want the backpack!

894
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,690
Wow!

895
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,490
What is that?

896
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,370
Oh, a bucket hat!

897
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,050
What is that?

898
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,510
To order call.

899
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:40,810
What?

900
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,030
888...

901
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,110
What is that?

902
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,050
It's just a pouch?

903
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,690
Oh my god, wait, that's kind of awesome.

904
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,130
What is that?

905
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,490
Oh, shorts.

906
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:55,950
Win the battle.

907
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,630
Wear the threads.

908
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:04,190
Wow.

909
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:05,710
Naughty dog.

910
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:09,410
I wish they had Metal Gear stuff.

911
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,350
That was kind of awesome.

912
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,430
OK, so we have Spyro, we have Crash Bash.

913
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,430
PS2 demo merch drop!

914
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,090
We have...

915
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,130
We have a grind session.

916
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,830
This is the other one that I was not very good at.

917
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:32,750
Crash Bash?

918
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,130
I can do the Crash Bash.

919
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,550
Move, fire missile.

920
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,170
That's it?

921
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,910
There's only two controls?

922
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:46,050
Charge and climb onto arena while in panic arena.

923
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:46,690
What does that mean?

924
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,070
Here we go.

925
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,010
Here we go.

926
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,170
Universal.

927
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,010
Oh my gosh!

928
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:00,650
Wow!

929
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,630
This is so...

930
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:04,790
Takes me back.

931
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:06,090
League.

932
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,690
Oh, leave game.

933
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,930
I thought it said league game.

934
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,380
I was like, how do you get online?

935
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,060
OK, let's just do adventure mode.

936
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,280
Oh, I can play with two players!

937
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,620
In a demo?

938
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,880
Probably not.

939
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,880
I wonder if I hooked up another controller.

940
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,480
Oh my gosh, wait, I do remember this vaguely.

941
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,460
We can't do Space Bash.

942
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,440
Oh, I think I did Pogo a lot.

943
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,020
Complete all challenges to unlock this...oh.

944
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,580
Nevermind.

945
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,220
Pogo Painter?

946
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,700
OK, here we go.

947
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,240
I'm going into the crashes!

948
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,520
I'm getting sucked in!

949
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,420
Capture colored squares to get the high score.

950
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,220
This is just...this is just crab game.

951
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,400
The loading?

952
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,480
Oh, come on.

953
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,260
It's all good.

954
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,020
Break these boxes to turn your squares into points.

955
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,420
Arrows color whole rows of squares.

956
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,160
Touch missiles to pick up.

957
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,180
Fire missiles.

958
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,380
Oh, OK.

959
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,440
Here I go.

960
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,180
Why?

961
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,100
We're going, we're going, we're...

962
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,880
Oh shoot, I messed that up.

963
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,760
I picked up a missile and I'm gonna use it on...this guy!

964
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,620
Uh oh, I'm not doing very well.

965
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,520
Yeah, oh, nice.

966
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,160
Kind of.

967
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:56,960
Oh my god.

968
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,200
Die!

969
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,560
Wait, this down here...

970
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,980
No, I didn't do...

971
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,440
OK.

972
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,280
OK.

973
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,540
OK.

974
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,980
Oh, not nice.

975
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,640
Kill his ass.

976
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,540
Kill his ass.

977
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't know if I'm winning.

978
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,920
Didn't I just pick up a missile or am I crazy?

979
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:31,870
No, no, no!

980
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:32,390
There we go.

981
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:32,970
Nice, nice, nice.

982
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,610
Am I winning guys?

983
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:35,210
Am I winning?

984
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:36,870
Oh, I think I'm winning.

985
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,570
I think I'm winning you guys.

986
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:42,930
Oh no, no, no, no.

987
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,430
Guys, I think I'm gonna win this one.

988
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,590
Guys, I think...

989
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,790
I keep screwing up.

990
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,190
Oh, whoops.

991
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,250
Hey, give me, give me.

992
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,010
No, stop!

993
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,450
Uh oh, uh oh.

994
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,650
Maybe I talked too soon.

995
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,590
No, no, no.

996
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:02,530
Give me my points.

997
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:03,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

998
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:04,510
OK.

999
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,170
You know what?

1000
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,850
Just take anything.

1001
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,210
Take anything we can get.

1002
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,190
Oh, I think I'm gonna win you guys.

1003
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:17,090
The AI is actually braindead.

1004
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,210
Oh, again?

1005
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:21,370
OK, OK.

1006
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:22,890
Cool.

1007
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,150
Oh, nice.

1008
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,370
I'll take it.

1009
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,330
And I'll take that.

1010
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,650
And I'll take that, baby.

1011
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,170
And I'll take that, idiot.

1012
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,770
And I'll take my money.

1013
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,050
No, my money.

1014
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:39,830
Nice.

1015
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,830
Oh, he has a... he has a...

1016
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,090
Nice.

1017
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,410
Oh, there we go.

1018
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:46,830
There we go.

1019
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,030
Hell yeah.

1020
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:57,390
I never... I had the actual CD of...

1021
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:59,250
What was it called?

1022
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,230
The Crash Racing.

1023
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:04,190
I had... Oh my god.

1024
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:09,740
Nice.

1025
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,620
Oh my god.

1026
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,660
I own like basically half the map.

1027
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,950
I didn't need that.

1028
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,050
Can another thing, please?

1029
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:31,570
Oh, there.

1030
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:32,150
Nice, nice.

1031
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:32,370
OK.

1032
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,540
Hey, you died.

1033
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,740
Stop taking... You are my closest enemy.

1034
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,240
The doctor guy is stupid as hell.

1035
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,780
That guy doesn't know how to do anything.

1036
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,600
Give me one last... Yeah.

1037
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,860
That guy is dumb as hell.

1038
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,600
Mental gaming?

1039
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,320
I'm gaming.

1040
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,740
How many do I have to do until...

1041
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,200
I want to unlock the other game.

1042
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,580
Are they ever going to use the...

1043
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,180
Well, that explains that question.

1044
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,820
I was going to say, are they ever going to use the...

1045
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,100
Oh, you jerk.

1046
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,580
I like to take the boxes so they can't...

1047
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,100
Get more points.

1048
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,160
Stop it!

1049
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,960
Can a box please drop?

1050
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:36,460
Oh, thank you.

1051
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,300
I think they are getting smarter, guys.

1052
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,300
How many times do I have to play this game?

1053
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,420
I want to demo everything.

1054
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,100
Yeah.

1055
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:56,960
Yeah.

1056
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,900
Mine and mine and mine and mine.

1057
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:09,700
Dummies.

1058
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,160
Big old idiots.

1059
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,440
Nice.

1060
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,460
Go get this.

1061
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1062
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,920
OK, good.

1063
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:18,740
He didn't get the other one.

1064
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,800
Yeah, they are absolute chumps.

1065
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,560
They are absolute chumps.

1066
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,640
These guys don't have a single brain cell.

1067
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,720
AI is going to take our jobs?

1068
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:30,980
Well...

1069
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,380
I'd like to see these bozos try.

1070
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,160
Am I good?

1071
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:40,360
Yeah,

1072
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,820
I only played the Crash Racing.

1073
00:57:58,990 --> 00:57:59,950
Polar Panic.

1074
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,630
Press X button to start.

1075
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,950
How do I get the pogo a go-go?

1076
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,010
What are all the challenges?

1077
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:07,910
They don't tell me.

1078
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,670
They don't even tell me what the challenges are.

1079
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:13,870
Maybe I have to complete this one.

1080
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,770
Polar Panic, my beloved.

1081
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,230
I don't remember this one.

1082
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,890
Gotta play in order.

1083
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:22,850
OK.

1084
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,550
Press square to spin.

1085
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,650
OK, thanks.

1086
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,050
Knock the other players off the ice to win.

1087
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,310
Charge the other players.

1088
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,970
Cannot charge if meter is empty.

1089
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:40,570
OK, but that's like... It all depends on your mindset, right?

1090
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,770
Some people would say that's half empty, but me?

1091
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,790
I would say that's half full.

1092
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:54,190
When falling, push into the arena and press square repeatedly.

1093
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,030
Pass the weight to other players.

1094
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:56,510
Collect...

1095
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,490
Oh, I do remember this one.

1096
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:05,010
Wait, charge the... OK, so we're charging... We're just pressing square, basically.

1097
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,560
I feel like I'm gonna lose my brain cells from this song.

1098
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,020
Collect lightning from the other... What is this guy supposed to be?

1099
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,700
The one on the... Is he an alligator?

1100
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,520
But, like, why then does he have... Is he a pig?

1101
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,100
I'm so confused.

1102
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,860
This demo looks like a bootleg Mario party.

1103
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,040
It was the ship when I was like 7.

1104
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,440
He's a dingodile.

1105
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,020
Dingo and a crocodile.

1106
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,200
Did he eat your baby?

1107
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,760
Pass the weight to other players.

1108
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,520
OK, let's just go for it.

1109
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,660
Look at the little polar bears!

1110
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,440
Oh my gosh, the Aurora Borealis.

1111
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,640
Oh my God!

1112
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,340
Oh my God.

1113
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,080
This is crazy.

1114
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,000
This is insanity.

1115
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,020
Oh my God.

1116
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,380
Oh my God, watch out.

1117
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,440
Watch out for the laser.

1118
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,060
Oh my God.

1119
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:07,560
Oh my God.

1120
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:08,840
You know what?

1121
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,580
Let the girls fight.

1122
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,380
Let them fight.

1123
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,200
Let the girls fight.

1124
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:16,660
What's that?

1125
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,300
What's that sound?

1126
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:18,380
No!

1127
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:18,620
No!

1128
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:18,880
No!

1129
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,300
No!

1130
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:19,720
No!

1131
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,220
I did it.

1132
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:23,880
I killed a person.

1133
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:24,780
I did it!

1134
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:25,880
I killed a man!

1135
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,510
Oh, he's tiny now.

1136
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,550
Oh shit, let the girls fight.

1137
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,550
The girls are fighting.

1138
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,870
Don't charge after me.

1139
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,070
Why?

1140
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:41,730
Oh, he just stopped moving.

1141
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,050
Don't touch me.

1142
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,120
I can't see anything.

1143
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,000
It's assault!

1144
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,400
No, no, no, please no.

1145
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,340
Oh my God.

1146
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,580
So you have to not... Oh, I did it.

1147
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,640
This should have been top down.

1148
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,380
For real, I can't see how far away I am.

1149
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:15,880
Yeah!

1150
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,460
So you have to... You want the laser.

1151
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
You want the lightning bolt.

1152
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,620
Why does it make that noise?

1153
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,640
It sounds so gross.

1154
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,480
Oh my God, no!

1155
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,200
I can't see where I am.

1156
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,380
They are blocking me.

1157
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,480
I can't see.

1158
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,540
They are too huge.

1159
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,840
I'm just a guy.

1160
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,380
I'm just a small little Crash...

1161
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,160
Wait.

1162
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,660
Oh yeah, I want this.

1163
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,800
Wait, do I have to watch the rest of the game?

1164
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,680
I have to watch these idiots play?

1165
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,260
No way!

1166
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,620
Just die... Oh my God, look at them both.

1167
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:25,750
Charge!

1168
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:26,850
Charge item!

1169
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,190
Dingo Dial wins!

1170
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:31,870
No!

1171
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,670
This one feels too real you guys.

1172
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,790
This one feels too real.

1173
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,030
Oh my gosh!

1174
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,770
Oh no, no, no, no!

1175
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,910
I might get charged, but... Nice!

1176
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,690
I think I'm too good at this game.

1177
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,650
I think I'm too good at this game.

1178
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,190
We gamed.

1179
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:04,990
We gamed that.

1180
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,770
So good.

1181
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:12,570
I was letting Dingo Dial have his little moment, but...

1182
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:18,930
Where am I?

1183
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,310
I can't see anything.

1184
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,590
One has died.

1185
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:28,330
Why does it sound like... What the hell?

1186
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,170
Oh that's him charging.

1187
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:30,550
Oh shit.

1188
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,160
Mintosweet?

1189
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:53,380
What?

1190
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,620
What was that?

1191
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:55,600
LOL.

1192
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,580
Mint lost to...

1193
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,920
What is Pogo a Gogo?

1194
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:11,220
Wait, I... I did... I played your games.

1195
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,480
Oh, I have to get the...

1196
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,400
I have to get the relic or the crystal.

1197
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,340
Which one is it?

1198
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,600
Challenges are not fun.

1199
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,620
I don't remember ever doing this one, I'll be honest.

1200
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,340
You have to do both of them?

1201
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,880
All six at the grind?

1202
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,160
OK, I think we're good then.

1203
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,540
I think Crash was fun.

1204
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,380
I think we can go on to the next game.

1205
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,700
I think we can go on to the next game, right?

1206
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,140
I think we're trying to sample platter everything.

1207
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,040
You know, we're just not gonna...

1208
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:02,600
We're not gonna... We don't need to play for so long, right?

1209
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,620
But I will do Spyro.

1210
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,140
I love Spyro 2.

1211
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,440
Ripto's Rage.

1212
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,720
I love Spyro 2.

1213
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,520
It was my favorite, because it was the only one I owned.

1214
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,840
I don't know, which... Does this one come in the series?

1215
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,480
Like, is it 3?

1216
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,440
Or...

1217
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,400
I don't know.

1218
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,160
This is 3.

1219
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,720
Get ready for Spyro's greatest adventure.

1220
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,400
Look how cute he... Oh my god!

1221
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,340
Oh my god!

1222
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,740
Bentley the strong man.

1223
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,780
Kick butt as Sheila the kangaroo.

1224
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,040
Command the skies as Sergeant Bird.

1225
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,580
Monkey around as Agent 9.

1226
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,200
Oh my god.

1227
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,560
Pilot new vehicles.

1228
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,240
Take on the new mini bosses and much more.

1229
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,340
Wow, they're selling it.

1230
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,120
They're selling it.

1231
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:06,340
Ok, let's not do any swimming levels, because that sounds horrible.

1232
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,460
Agent 9's lab.

1233
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:12,740
Ok.

1234
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,900
We could try playing as him.

1235
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,260
Are you gonna break the demo discs once you're done?

1236
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,760
Why would I break them?

1237
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,000
Which one should I do?

1238
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,080
Stretched out logo?

1239
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,480
It really is so stretched out.

1240
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,760
It's a gallery shooter.

1241
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,220
I'll try Minky.

1242
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,640
Break that disc.

1243
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,460
If I did that, I wouldn't even have this.

1244
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,780
I wouldn't even have this stream if I broke the disc.

1245
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,040
5 months of into.

1246
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,360
Thank you Urban Canary.

1247
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,120
Wow, this is a really long load time.

1248
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,440
How much can we sing?

1249
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,940
What should I sing?

1250
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,580
What song should we sing to see how long these load times are?

1251
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,000
Snake Eater?

1252
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:29,860
Do a mix?

1253
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,620
I didn't say I am...

1254
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:06,060
I don't...

1255
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,080
Flying in the stores!

1256
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,040
It

1257
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,880
just took that long!

1258
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,660
Don't you just press a button?

1259
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,080
Well, it didn't tell me that.

1260
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,580
Maybe I was supposed to just press the button.

1261
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,400
What?

1262
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:46,900
They just advertised the game and then were just like...

1263
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,260
You'll have to see!

1264
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,920
Let's try one more time.

1265
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,500
The adventure continues.

1266
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,540
It's a demo speedrun.

1267
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,920
It's continuing alright.

1268
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,840
The adventure does continue.

1269
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,760
They are like, it will continue when you buy our game.

1270
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,020
I'll admit they are selling me.

1271
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,360
When do we get to the ride?

1272
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,880
This is the ride!

1273
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,100
Guys, I think it's going to go...

1274
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:04,980
Now!

1275
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,510
Now!

1276
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,170
You gotta put the Konami code.

1277
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,510
Up, up, down, down...

1278
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,350
Left, right...

1279
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,670
A, B, A, B, start?

1280
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:25,650
My trick to make games load when I was young was to not look at the screen.

1281
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,170
Oh, true!

1282
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:27,910
Everybody, it's shy.

1283
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,650
Don't look at the screen.

1284
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,650
Don't look at the screen, ok?

1285
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:32,330
It's shy.

1286
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:33,650
Don't look.

1287
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:34,970
Look away.

1288
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:36,430
Look at me.

1289
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:37,070
Here, hold on.

1290
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:39,410
Look at me instead.

1291
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:40,550
Ok.

1292
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,150
It's shy.

1293
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,990
It's shy.

1294
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,550
So, we are just going to face the other way.

1295
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:48,810
We are going to close our eyes.

1296
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,430
Ok.

1297
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,620
I'm not looking at it.

1298
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,520
Um...

1299
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,620
You used up all your Spyro privileges back in 2001.

1300
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,920
What if it actually had like a...

1301
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,900
Had like a...

1302
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,720
You can only play this many times before it locks.

1303
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,580
Sort of mechanism.

1304
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,120
Stop cheating?

1305
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,080
I'm not cheating!

1306
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,280
I'm closing my eyes.

1307
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,640
Ok, we are meditating.

1308
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:31,520
Are you guys... Do you guys have your eyes closed though?

1309
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,900
You guys have your eyes closed?

1310
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,760
Guys, I don't think... I think this demo is broken.

1311
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,760
I think we can't... I think we are...

1312
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,220
We are not prepared for Minky action.

1313
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,740
What if they were just like...

1314
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:55,100
Oh, Agent 009 was copyrighted, so...

1315
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,020
We have to...

1316
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,900
We had to erase this part.

1317
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,540
My eyes are open.

1318
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,740
Close your eyes!

1319
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,200
Nintendo, do that limit demos try?

1320
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:09,740
Does it really?

1321
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,580
Smash the... No!

1322
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,600
It's also not a Playstation 1, it's my PS2.

1323
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:20,250
Yeah, it might probably is the disc.

1324
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,830
The adventure continues.

1325
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:28,850
Or does it?

1326
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,270
Does the adventure...

1327
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:35,270
Ok, I want to try one more time.

1328
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:38,190
Because...

1329
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:39,830
I want to try...

1330
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:42,010
If the first level will work.

1331
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:44,370
But...

1332
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:45,630
I think the game is frozen.

1333
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:48,590
I don't remember... How long did it take before to kick us out?

1334
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,090
There is something I want to say.

1335
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:08,050
Spiral is really cute.

1336
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:10,990
I like it, I like it, I love it.

1337
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:12,270
I love it.

1338
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,960
I finally found it.

1339
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:16,880
Princess, Prince.

1340
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:28,070
Let's live together.

1341
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:31,530
I love you the most in the world.

1342
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,410
I love you.

1343
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:36,790
I love you.

1344
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:40,350
Ok, I'm going to restart it.

1345
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,420
There we go.

1346
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,000
I polished all of them right before stream.

1347
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,180
So I think it's just too scratched.

1348
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,440
I think it's just a little too scratched probably.

1349
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,240
We get the sound again.

1350
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,220
Yeah, you will.

1351
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,640
Three more times even.

1352
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,980
You will even a couple more times.

1353
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,420
What did he tell me to do?

1354
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,100
God damn.

1355
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,820
PlayStation Underground is...

1356
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:41,560
There we go.

1357
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,080
Alright.

1358
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,960
This might be a mistake, but...

1359
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,200
If it is, it's ok.

1360
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,300
If it doesn't work, we'll just...

1361
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,220
It threw me off guard.

1362
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:59,560
We even listened to it earlier and I think I was just so shocked by the intro, I didn't even...

1363
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,800
Ok, we're gonna...

1364
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,140
We're gonna try the first level.

1365
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,140
I say Peak.

1366
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,060
You guys, it's Peak.

1367
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,800
And it's gonna...Oh no.

1368
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:17,880
No, please.

1369
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,060
No, Adventure!

1370
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:19,880
Adventure

1371
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:24,850
will continue.

1372
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,090
Oh sorry.

1373
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,090
Oh my gosh, I got so excited I threw everything up in the world.

1374
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:31,030
Hello!

1375
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,130
Oh my god.

1376
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:41,670
Old Spiral.

1377
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:51,990
Oh no.

1378
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:53,450
Top of the mornin' to ya.

1379
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,390
The music is kind of awesome.

1380
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:59,270
Oh my goodness.

1381
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:05,070
I kind of remember the controls from Old Spiral, so I think...

1382
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:07,190
I think they're pretty much the same.

1383
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,130
Let's try this thing.

1384
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:13,990
Let's get on this thing.

1385
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,050
So over here?

1386
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,050
Shoot!

1387
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:22,050
Shoot straight, huh?

1388
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,910
Big dummy.

1389
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:25,890
You don't even know...

1390
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,970
You don't even know how to do anything.

1391
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,350
What do you mean it doesn't shoot straight?

1392
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,510
I think your eyeballs are on crooked.

1393
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:35,190
Actually, they might actually be on crooked.

1394
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,290
Oh shoot.

1395
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,010
Maybe don't go head first into the...

1396
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:47,990
Let's shoot the birds.

1397
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:48,970
Can you shoot the birds?

1398
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:53,130
Maybe don't go head first into the guy with the TNT.

1399
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,430
Okay, this is as high as it goes.

1400
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,890
Okay, that's actually pretty high.

1401
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,510
My aim...

1402
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:06,310
I can't tell how...

1403
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,730
How high is this?

1404
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,910
Oh, that was pretty close actually.

1405
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:11,970
Okay, I think this one needs to be lower and...

1406
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,110
What's his flight path?

1407
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,910
I can't tell where I'm aiming.

1408
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:19,630
Lower?

1409
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:20,290
Okay.

1410
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:21,250
Lower.

1411
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:22,210
Oh my gosh.

1412
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,410
I don't even know if I can kill these guys.

1413
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:28,310
I just want to.

1414
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,830
I just want to cause death.

1415
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:36,430
You can.

1416
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,170
I think I remember this demo, yeah.

1417
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,330
Up one, I think.

1418
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:42,790
There we go.

1419
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:44,690
Nope, nevermind.

1420
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,470
That was too close.

1421
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,370
Yeah, I enjoy all the killing.

1422
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:51,830
Oh, so close.

1423
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:53,790
There we go.

1424
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:56,590
Nice.

1425
01:17:58,410 --> 01:17:59,650
Okay, now we got him.

1426
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,510
Why does this feel like already...

1427
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:02,790
Hello?

1428
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:03,710
Hello?

1429
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:04,510
I can't jump?

1430
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:04,850
Okay.

1431
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:07,490
The white is so blinding though.

1432
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,450
It's kind of hurting my eyes, I'm not gonna lie.

1433
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:09,510
Okay.

1434
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:20,520
I like how this game looks exactly like Spyro 2.

1435
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,660
Wait, how do I go home?

1436
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,140
Can you still do that?

1437
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:26,640
Okay, good.

1438
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,920
I still remember the controls.

1439
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,240
Yeah, it's pretty hard to look at.

1440
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:32,120
It's hurting my eyes.

1441
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,860
Oh, that guy is bad news.

1442
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,840
Bad news bears.

1443
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,500
I'm gonna charge him.

1444
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,080
Oh shoot.

1445
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,560
They're all TNT men.

1446
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,460
Wait, if I blow fire on... Oh, maybe I'll be fine.

1447
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,320
I thought it was the same guy like carrying it before.

1448
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,320
Eat my little guy.

1449
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,920
Regain your energy.

1450
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,320
Flame the boxes?

1451
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,710
Makes sense.

1452
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:14,170
Oh, that's a big guy over there.

1453
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,790
That's a big guy over there.

1454
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,030
For Spyro at the best music?

1455
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:23,270
I don't think I ever played the first Spyro.

1456
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,070
I'll be honest.

1457
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,230
Okay, we gotta charge.

1458
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:27,990
Can

1459
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:45,290
I not charge these guys?

1460
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:48,470
Just kidding.

1461
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:50,350
I don't remember everything about Spyro.

1462
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:51,430
I'm a liar!

1463
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:52,830
I'm a big fan!

1464
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:55,030
Yeah, give me that.

1465
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:57,050
Give me the... Hello little fairy.

1466
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,510
Give me my coins?

1467
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:01,550
Oh, that's weird.

1468
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:02,950
Oh my god!

1469
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,530
My guy is dead!

1470
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:06,470
My sparks!

1471
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:09,370
I was like, hey, why isn't anybody collecting the coins for me?

1472
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:12,990
Because he's...

1473
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,910
Oh, there's a little guy over there.

1474
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:21,450
He kind of looks like... He's just like a couple of black pixels, but...

1475
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:26,190
If I don't have sparks, I'm dead dead for real.

1476
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:27,990
I wonder what's up there.

1477
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:31,290
What is that?

1478
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,650
It takes us back to the beginning.

1479
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,470
Fine, okay.

1480
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,130
Oh, I almost missed one.

1481
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:52,190
Oh my gosh, I miss having sparks.

1482
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,870
He collects all the little gemmies.

1483
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:56,450
It is so hard to see.

1484
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:57,610
No, no, no, no, no!

1485
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:00,450
Oh shit.

1486
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:02,210
I'm gonna die!

1487
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:09,450
So the music for the first Spyros were used for the Amanda show?

1488
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,210
No way.

1489
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:12,970
Oh, we got sparks back.

1490
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,490
All is well.

1491
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,270
Oh, I missed... I don't have any gemmies though.

1492
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:24,650
Okay, let's get this guy before he takes my...

1493
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:25,450
Takes me out.

1494
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:26,990
We'll take him out before he gets me.

1495
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:31,430
This level is so hard on my eyes.

1496
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,310
Everything burns.

1497
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,360
It burns my eyes.

1498
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,260
Frame rate sucks.

1499
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,520
It's a Playstation 1.

1500
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:50,820
What do you expect?

1501
01:21:52,880 --> 01:22:01,920
I can't believe that this 20 year old technology doesn't have better graphics.

1502
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:06,120
Was the Playstation actually a failure?

1503
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,080
More.

1504
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,500
Oh shit!

1505
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,360
More at 11.

1506
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,780
Look, I don't even need these stupid duckies.

1507
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,200
How do I get these though?

1508
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,520
It's the Spyro 3 disc trilogy from my PS1 as a kid.

1509
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,920
I let a neighbor borrow it and they never gave it back and moved away!

1510
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,380
No!

1511
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,200
My sister's friends would always steal my games too.

1512
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,620
So I lost so many.

1513
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:48,220
I had to buy the Kingdom Hearts like 3 times.

1514
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,020
Which is quite pricey.

1515
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,140
Especially for a kid, you know?

1516
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,300
I had to use my allowance every time.

1517
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,360
And then I also had to buy the Sims like 5 times.

1518
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,900
Because my sister's friends just kept stealing them.

1519
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,740
Oh my god.

1520
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,680
First Spyro gave me motion sick.

1521
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:14,620
You know what?

1522
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,540
That's so fair.

1523
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,440
Even this one is kind of making me feel...bleh.

1524
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,540
Can I hit that thing?

1525
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,240
Maybe I can't.

1526
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:24,960
Nevermind, give up.

1527
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:32,270
How do I get up here?

1528
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,330
Maybe from over there?

1529
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:39,510
I love Spyro though.

1530
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,810
Are you sure?

1531
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:44,230
I can't hit the eggy?

1532
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:47,370
Nah.

1533
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,180
TNT.

1534
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,160
Oh, I'll shoot.

1535
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,080
How do you...

1536
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,620
How do you do this?

1537
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,440
I don't remember.

1538
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,460
Had one guy steal my Pokemon Blue, Silver, Sapphire, Emerald...

1539
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:11,040
Sadly he was somehow 6'6 and 12 years old.

1540
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,340
That guy is just a freak then.

1541
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,920
That guy is just not normal to nature.

1542
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,380
It's not your fault.

1543
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,700
I'm normal.

1544
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:26,440
Everything is fine.

1545
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:34,060
He's immune?

1546
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:35,180
Oh my god.

1547
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,400
6 shots.

1548
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,240
Let's blow this.

1549
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,110
Nice.

1550
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:55,650
One thing I love about Spyro is how many little tiny areas there are to explore.

1551
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,410
See, like we can go that way.

1552
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:58,530
So fun.

1553
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,190
I'm just gonna go for it.

1554
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:09,470
Well, in the end, it worked.

1555
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:12,390
Let's go this way.

1556
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:14,610
Thank you Sparks.

1557
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,990
Met Tom Kenny.

1558
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:20,930
Wait, is he only Spyro from two... Oh, he wasn't Spyro in one.

1559
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,490
He seems like a nice guy.

1560
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:40,810
Take him out.

1561
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:41,710
Oh, the bird!

1562
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,090
Maynard.

1563
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:46,770
Oh, that's not a bird at all!

1564
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:47,350
That's a dragon!

1565
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,870
He's Eevee?

1566
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:52,750
Oh my god.

1567
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:53,290
Oh my god.

1568
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:57,690
Wait, from here can we... No.

1569
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:01,670
He's a little Eevee guy.

1570
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,560
Oh my homies love Maynard.

1571
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,420
That guy.

1572
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,520
He's awesome.

1573
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,600
Maynard supremacy everybody.

1574
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:18,980
Oh no, no, no.

1575
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:19,500
Move, move, move.

1576
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,280
I can't see where I am.

1577
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,360
Oh, so close.

1578
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,000
Just hit him.

1579
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,000
Just hit... Oh, not him.

1580
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,360
Hit the other guy.

1581
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:35,710
Spyro, just go!

1582
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,170
We got him.

1583
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,630
You have fire breath.

1584
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:45,290
The fire breath doesn't work on those guys.

1585
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:51,930
Fire breath, they just go...

1586
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,930
It doesn't work on them.

1587
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:55,630
They don't care.

1588
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:04,290
Gosh.

1589
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,030
Aren't you a fan of Spyro?

1590
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,790
You don't even know that you can't even...

1591
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:10,270
You can't even breath on them?

1592
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,830
Can I fly over there?

1593
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:16,590
What if I blow up all of these?

1594
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:19,250
Wait, can I go any lower?

1595
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:19,890
Oh, I can.

1596
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:29,200
Good, now I don't have to worry about it.

1597
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:40,910
Wait.

1598
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:43,110
Oh no.

1599
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,270
Don't make me do it again.

1600
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:50,250
Charge and fly?

1601
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:50,830
OK.

1602
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:54,050
Do I have to kill this guy again?

1603
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:54,930
These guys?

1604
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:55,590
OK.

1605
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:57,950
Watch, I'll show you, I'll show you.

1606
01:27:59,510 --> 01:27:59,950
See?

1607
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,470
See?

1608
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:03,690
It does nothing to them.

1609
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:05,990
They go...

1610
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:08,390
Come here.

1611
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:19,110
I wish I hadn't killed that bird.

1612
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:22,570
I wish I hadn't killed that bird.

1613
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,410
What was in that room again?

1614
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,240
Oh, that's a gemmy.

1615
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,100
I thought it was a lizard.

1616
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,400
Fake Spyro fans in the chat!

1617
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:36,460
Fake Spyro!

1618
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,780
Look at all these boxes.

1619
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,680
What if Solid Snake is under one of them?

1620
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,560
Snake, I'm sorry.

1621
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,040
Oh, we didn't go into that room yet.

1622
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,260
Because we destroyed this.

1623
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,540
I apologize for being wrong on the Internet.

1624
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,960
You should be!

1625
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,340
You should apologize!

1626
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:54,780
You should.

1627
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,320
It's OK.

1628
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,500
We've all been wrong on the Internet.

1629
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,180
Raise your hand if you've been wrong on the Internet.

1630
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,360
Help me.

1631
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,620
I'm not raising my hand.

1632
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,020
Oh wait, I'm raising both of my hands.

1633
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,760
But it's like a condition.

1634
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,580
I can't help it.

1635
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,760
Wait, am I at the end of the level already?

1636
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,020
No way.

1637
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:23,660
That's spooky.

1638
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:26,820
Couldn't be me.

1639
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,580
Couldn't be me either.

1640
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,880
It would be really embarrassing to be wrong on the Internet.

1641
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,860
Let's kill these... Wait, aren't these the birds I took out before?

1642
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:40,800
It's too close.

1643
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,080
You!

1644
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,120
Yeah!

1645
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:49,000
You mixed up the 6 for 9 in Little Misfortune.

1646
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,560
You're gonna break that!

1647
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,040
That was literally your mistake!

1648
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,300
I did nothing!

1649
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,700
I was correct!

1650
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,280
I was accurate in every time!

1651
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,340
OK, there's a lot to go around in here.

1652
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,480
Oh, shoot.

1653
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,200
I didn't realize it was a drop-off.

1654
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:12,940
Do

1655
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:19,090
they still make Spyro games?

1656
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,470
Or did they...

1657
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,090
What is this?

1658
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,330
The music stopped.

1659
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,550
Should I go through it?

1660
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:39,670
They made him like Ikemen and then they... I haven't seen him again.

1661
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,220
Just the remake.

1662
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,360
I'm going in!

1663
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,760
What is this?

1664
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,200
Don't crash my game, please.

1665
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:59,860
Who is this?

1666
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:01,940
Piggy?

1667
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,440
And Purple who breathes fire.

1668
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:25,160
You're saying all the right things.

1669
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,680
Oh my god, look at Spyro's eyes.

1670
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,440
They're literally bulging from his head.

1671
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,420
He's like...

1672
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:32,960
Did you say Purple and Handsome?

1673
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,680
She sounds just like you.

1674
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:41,200
I sure wish I had a partner.

1675
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:45,260
Someone courageous and strong and not a wisp.

1676
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,220
Will you please help me perform my ice dance?

1677
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,120
My ice dance?

1678
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,320
Me and Rhinocaccy players keep hogging the ice and all I want to do is dance.

1679
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,980
Well maybe they reserved it first lady.

1680
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:57,960
I don't know what to tell you.

1681
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,460
Protect the dancer from evil hockey players?

1682
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:01,180
Yes.

1683
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:01,900
No.

1684
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,640
They were like you're too evil to play Spyro.

1685
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,280
You even gave the Noah thought.

1686
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,700
You're too evil.

1687
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:28,580
I wonder if this one has a time limit.

1688
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,980
That's so funny.

1689
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:36,200
The illusion of choice.

1690
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,680
I didn't even press anything.

1691
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:40,460
Oh it is timed.

1692
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:40,740
OK.

1693
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,020
Watch the Legend of Dragoon trailer.

1694
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:47,920
Is it always a trailer?

1695
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,140
Oh it says video.

1696
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:51,700
You're right.

1697
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:57,220
Game was a wisp and took offense to that.

1698
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:00,360
Let's see.

1699
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,920
Let's watch the Legend of Dragoon.

1700
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,400
The journey that seeks the past ends.

1701
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:05,820
What?

1702
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:09,620
The journey to discover today begins.

1703
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:13,380
Legend of the Dragoon.

1704
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,200
An extraordinary...Oh magnificence.

1705
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:19,840
Deception.

1706
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,520
Retribution.

1707
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,180
Magical combat.

1708
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:32,160
The music is kind of awesome.

1709
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,580
Innovative and deeply involving gameplay.

1710
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:39,300
I can't open it.

1711
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:44,550
You have little pixel man being like...

1712
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:51,610
You know what it reminded me of?

1713
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:57,710
You know how when people put characters like Shrek or Edgeworth over top those dogs?

1714
01:33:57,810 --> 01:34:02,690
That one dog video of it going through the tubes and everything like that.

1715
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:05,890
It looked just like that.

1716
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:14,010
He was just zooming through those maps.

1717
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,370
The music is really great though.

1718
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:17,710
Wow!

1719
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:19,630
That actually looks so good.

1720
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,510
Wait, who developed this?

1721
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:25,230
Trademark of Sony.

1722
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:29,710
Legend of Dragoon was ahead of it's time for RPG mechanics.

1723
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,610
I love this game.

1724
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,300
That's so funny.

1725
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,040
I want to see that part again.

1726
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:44,340
I stopped paying attention because I was thinking of the dog.

1727
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:44,380
Dog.

1728
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,680
Medieval 2 time?

1729
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,040
Yeah!

1730
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,120
Let's do Medieval.

1731
01:34:55,240 --> 01:35:00,760
Actually, I kind of want to do the skateboarding one real quick and then we'll do Medieval Lost.

1732
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,540
If that's okay.

1733
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,620
It's so funny.

1734
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,080
I love how they are saying all this stuff and not showing any of it.

1735
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,380
I can't...

1736
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,360
This music is so beautiful though.

1737
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,260
I love it.

1738
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:18,800
Here we go, here we go.

1739
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,480
Imagine the dog going through the tube.

1740
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,860
Tactical combat system.

1741
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,440
Collect over 200 usable items, skills and magic.

1742
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,320
That's a lot.

1743
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:41,860
Dragon!

1744
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:46,220
Or Dragoon.

1745
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,260
Hot girl, transform into Dragoons!

1746
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,480
You get to transform into the Dragoon!

1747
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:58,760
Oh my gosh.

1748
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:08,750
It's great.

1749
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:12,690
Items like potions, strong potions, max potions.

1750
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:18,410
We put 197 left.

1751
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:20,150
Alright.

1752
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:26,770
Like I said, let's do grind session and then we'll finish it off with Medieval 2.

1753
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:32,950
Okay, I don't care.

1754
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:35,290
I just want to play for like 2 seconds.

1755
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:36,630
What about Legend of Wisp?

1756
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,270
There's no legend.

1757
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:39,750
There's no legend.

1758
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:41,330
Oh, Spider-Man?

1759
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:42,090
Oh yeah.

1760
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:43,690
Oh gosh, you guys.

1761
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:47,450
We're going to be here forever if I play every single game on me.

1762
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:52,270
Okay, I'm just going to play for like 2 seconds.

1763
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:58,350
Tournament?

1764
01:36:58,350 --> 01:36:59,630
I can't do just training?

1765
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:04,130
Oh my god.

1766
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:05,430
I'm going to be Willy!

1767
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:14,940
My mom has dyslexia and instead of a cat girl I got a rat girl for my birthday.

1768
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:17,460
Problem is I work at the cheese factory.

1769
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:21,100
What?

1770
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:24,740
Day 1.

1771
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,320
Kara Beth Burnside.

1772
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,040
Damn.

1773
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:30,560
Ed Templeton.

1774
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,300
Pigpen.

1775
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,440
John Cardiel.

1776
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,620
Willy Santos.

1777
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,720
Day 1 song.

1778
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,800
Kara Beth Burnside.

1779
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:53,900
Ed Templeton.

1780
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,560
Pigpen.

1781
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,500
Okay, we have to be Pigpen.

1782
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,300
Let me select the character.

1783
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,340
Guys, I'm scared of this one.

1784
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,580
Guys, I'm scared of this one.

1785
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:14,880
Why did it go back?

1786
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:15,700
Okay, hold on.

1787
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,580
Okay, Pigpen.

1788
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,180
Oh, I can't choose Pigpen.

1789
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:23,240
He is blacked out.

1790
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,580
I can only be Ed or Day 1.

1791
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:26,840
I'm being Ed.

1792
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:29,400
I'm Ed Templeton.

1793
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:30,480
Okay, bio.

1794
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,280
What's the bio?

1795
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,340
Oh god.

1796
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:39,900
Age.

1797
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:40,540
25.

1798
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:41,360
Give or take.

1799
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,440
Year skating.

1800
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,380
15.

1801
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,600
Blood type.

1802
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,540
No idea.

1803
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,000
Goofy or regular?

1804
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:47,900
Regular.

1805
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,980
Wait, I want to make something like this for Wisps.

1806
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,560
Goofy, freaky or regular.

1807
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,240
Years as a Wisp.

1808
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:05,720
15.

1809
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:06,980
Height.

1810
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:07,640
6 feet.

1811
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,860
Okay, maybe not the super personal questions.

1812
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,560
Orange County, California.

1813
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:14,680
Current hometown.

1814
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:16,660
Huntington Beach, California.

1815
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:17,900
Who is your hero?

1816
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:20,160
I try to be my own hero.

1817
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:21,540
Any villains?

1818
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,380
Closed minds.

1819
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,960
He said that he was regular though.

1820
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,020
This guy is all sorts of goof.

1821
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:39,800
Oh, Ed Templeton.

1822
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:40,680
I love you.

1823
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,480
You

1824
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:51,550
know what?

1825
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:53,250
That's all I needed to see, honestly.

1826
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:00,710
That's all I needed to see.

1827
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:02,710
Truthfully.

1828
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:03,690
I think we are good.

1829
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:07,850
Okay, Medieval 2.

1830
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:08,790
Oh wait.

1831
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:10,170
Hold on, we'll go back.

1832
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:11,490
Let's do Spider-Man.

1833
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:12,190
Spider-Man first.

1834
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:16,050
I don't remember ever really playing Spider-Man so I have no nostalgia for it.

1835
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,250
Regular vs.

1836
01:40:18,370 --> 01:40:20,930
Goofy just means which foot you place first on a skateboard.

1837
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:21,730
Oh wait, actually?

1838
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:22,850
Okay.

1839
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:24,910
Oh my gosh.

1840
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:25,890
Impact web.

1841
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,130
Web yank.

1842
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:28,410
Web dome.

1843
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:30,190
Web spikes.

1844
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:30,910
Kick jump.

1845
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:32,250
Dude, this is so much.

1846
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,070
Okay, here we go.

1847
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:36,570
It's a skate term.

1848
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:41,030
I thought it was just like, how's your personality?

1849
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:43,250
I'm regular.

1850
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:45,210
I'm a regular old Joe.

1851
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:46,690
Ed Templeton.

1852
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:48,210
That's me.

1853
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:49,870
I'm just a simple guy.

1854
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:56,230
Some of you guys were saying that this one was actually pretty good.

1855
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,570
This game was legit excellent.

1856
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:03,330
Oh damn.

1857
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,540
Could Mint Phantom beat Ed Templeton in a skate-off?

1858
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:11,020
No.

1859
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,080
But a freak-off?

1860
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:12,900
Probably.

1861
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,460
Pretty fun for the time.

1862
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:17,300
Oh nice.

1863
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,520
I feel like... I don't know.

1864
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,840
I don't know many Spider-Man games but I feel like...

1865
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:24,480
What?

1866
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,300
Oh guys...

1867
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:26,760
No!

1868
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,060
Guys we keep getting kicked out!

1869
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,680
I wanted to actually play it.

1870
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:42,980
I was gonna say, I think most Spider-Man games I've seen have been pretty good.

1871
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:44,340
Okay, let's try Medieval 2.

1872
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,380
Please don't...

1873
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:51,480
The worst part is that I don't think this is my even most scuffed CD so...

1874
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,400
How about my next one?

1875
01:41:53,980 --> 01:42:00,020
Oh this one is actually quite pristine.

1876
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:01,540
I think we'll be good with it.

1877
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,000
Oh my gosh.

1878
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:06,540
Oh my god.

1879
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:08,800
This is so nostalgic.

1880
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:09,380
Wow!

1881
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:24,260
This game used to scare the heck out of me.

1882
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,960
I could barely play the demo.

1883
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:30,860
I used to be terrified of... enemies.

1884
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,360
Once again.

1885
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,740
Sir Daniel Fortescue.

1886
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,700
Look at his eyes.

1887
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,980
I think they are bigger than mine.

1888
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:49,880
Get ready for a scrap!

1889
01:42:56,220 --> 01:43:00,880
I... can't... understand... your... accent.

1890
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,140
Oh my god.

1891
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,540
This running... I can't even stand in your spectral trail.

1892
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:15,660
Fortescue.

1893
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,360
Excuse me.

1894
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,060
Resume.

1895
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,940
Nevermind, I didn't know you'd say the same thing.

1896
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,240
I can't skip it.

1897
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,120
Just kidding, I can.

1898
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,120
Look at me.

1899
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,000
Look at me run.

1900
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,860
I'm quite limber for someone who just woke up from the dead.

1901
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:39,660
Why do they just have my zombie corpse body on display anyway?

1902
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:06,420
The next bus to Bikini Bottom.

1903
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:14,180
It is said that in times of great need he will return again to free the land from evil.

1904
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,360
Well, that's why we are here, huh?

1905
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,320
I'm going back to sleep.

1906
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,740
Well, actually I would if I...

1907
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:24,200
These camera angles...

1908
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,980
At least I can control this one with the... Oh no, it's backwards though.

1909
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,900
Why does he stop so abruptly?

1910
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:34,620
What does this say?

1911
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,920
Oh my god, it's a hand!

1912
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,480
Hello?

1913
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,160
Are you my sparks?

1914
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:44,740
Is that my health?

1915
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,000
I'm missing an arm!

1916
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:49,000
That's a zombie!

1917
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,000
Wait, I have my arm.

1918
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:52,900
It's my weapon.

1919
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:54,860
Ok, hold on, how do I fight?

1920
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:01,530
Oh there we go.

1921
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:02,650
Ok, I'm armed.

1922
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:03,250
I'm armed.

1923
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:04,730
Come here zombie.

1924
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:06,030
Oh there is a lot of them.

1925
01:45:07,230 --> 01:45:09,530
It's ok, we'll just take out...

1926
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:09,870
Get

1927
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,010
out of here.

1928
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:19,250
I actually scared them off.

1929
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:23,810
I scared them off.

1930
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:25,450
Wait, come back.

1931
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:27,150
Why did you leave?

1932
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:30,090
Oh...

1933
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:32,990
Oh my god, they are fast.

1934
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:36,650
Everything moves so quickly in this game.

1935
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:38,630
I killed one.

1936
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,950
Well, he was already dead.

1937
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:44,270
I took care of business.

1938
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:47,210
Oh my goodness, you are in the walls.

1939
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:48,230
Come here!

1940
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:48,930
Come here!

1941
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,170
When do I get my sword?

1942
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:53,650
Hey, don't run away!

1943
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,420
He is nuts!

1944
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,860
He is just flailing everywhere.

1945
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:00,920
I'm just a patron of the arts.

1946
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:03,200
My bad.

1947
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,340
I can't see.

1948
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,580
I'm just a patron of the arts.

1949
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,180
Found a museum key.

1950
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,420
Where did my little hand guy go?

1951
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,840
What happened here?

1952
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:24,700
This is ridiculous.

1953
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,020
Ok, let's go to the other side.

1954
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,880
Oh, I see a spectral trail.

1955
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,120
That's disgusting.

1956
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,460
I would never leave a spectral trail like that.

1957
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,860
That is not something that ghosts are supposed to do you guys.

1958
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:40,920
That's like leaving crumbs everywhere.

1959
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,660
It's awful.

1960
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,600
Is this my sword?

1961
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:48,760
Yes!

1962
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,280
That's like leaving everything around.

1963
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,680
It's like horrible, horrible manners.

1964
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,480
This guy sucks.

1965
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:02,920
Maybe I should have grabbed this before I went over here.

1966
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,560
Oh, I got my arm back.

1967
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:09,320
Let's go.

1968
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:16,760
Can I... The camera is really throwing me a bit through a loop right now.

1969
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,080
Ok, I think we have to come back.

1970
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,480
For the parkour area.

1971
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:29,510
Oh my god!

1972
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:33,310
Oh,

1973
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:45,150
ouchie ouch.

1974
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:54,700
This is how I protected the city long ago.

1975
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,440
Energy vial, nice.

1976
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:05,640
What's this?

1977
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:08,660
A gun?

1978
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:10,620
No way.

1979
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,760
Wait, I kind of want my sword back though.

1980
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,740
How do I switch?

1981
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,520
How do I use this?

1982
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,840
L1 Square

1983
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,180
Wow!

1984
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:49,500
Oh my god, look at us.

1985
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,040
We're so high.

1986
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,420
What are you looking at?

1987
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:55,800
It's doing that old video game thing where they would look at things that like...

1988
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:59,560
You're just like, oh, there must be something over there because you're looking at it.

1989
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:06,040
What a charming smile you have.

1990
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,120
It's so cute.

1991
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,240
Ok, I want my sword back.

1992
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,880
He's looking at me.

1993
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,320
He's got such a charming little smile.

1994
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:19,500
He is beautiful.

1995
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,020
Oh god, don't fall.

1996
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,220
A shield?

1997
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,440
Why is the audio for this guy so quiet?

1998
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,160
Airy

1999
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,860
The voice actor really just kind of...

2000
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:49,320
Copper.

2001
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:50,800
Oh, Copper Shield!

2002
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:53,080
How do I use it though?

2003
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:53,700
Oh my god.

2004
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,620
Oh, that's the coin.

2005
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,440
I mean the key we got.

2006
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,100
No, there was some more stuff over here.

2007
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:03,180
Sorry guys.

2008
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:06,160
That's exactly... I can't get used to these controls.

2009
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:06,780
I'm sorry.

2010
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:08,280
There we go.

2011
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:08,660
In here?

2012
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,480
And then we go up here?

2013
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:15,440
Why is X to fight and not to jump?

2014
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:19,960
Oh, energy.

2015
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,240
Ok, we'll save that for later.

2016
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:23,260
What's over here?

2017
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,940
Give me your advice, oh wise ghost.

2018
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,020
Please?

2019
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,080
Please?

2020
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:32,460
Hello?

2021
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:34,100
Oh, there we go.

2022
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:37,520
Dane?

2023
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:45,280
Are these demo discs on actual hardware?

2024
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:45,840
They are!

2025
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:46,280
Yeah!

2026
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:58,460
I did not pay attention to what he just said.

2027
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,340
Money baby!

2028
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:03,160
Ok, cool.

2029
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:04,420
Let's just keep going.

2030
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,900
Oh, but you gotta sell me now.

2031
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,260
Oh, you came!

2032
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,420
He put everything...he became like a spider monkey so quickly.

2033
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:25,860
Oh my god.

2034
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:30,460
We are so nimble.

2035
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:32,880
What's this?

2036
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,660
Oh god, they are killing me.

2037
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,500
Ouch.

2038
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:53,120
I can't just run around as funny as with the other...oh god.

2039
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:54,420
That's actually...oh god.

2040
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:55,800
How do I use my shield?

2041
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:01,320
I just wanna be a little nimble man!

2042
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:06,380
Triangle?

2043
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:07,680
I don't think it worked.

2044
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,600
Unless...oh there we go.

2045
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:11,300
Nice!

2046
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:14,440
I dashed!

2047
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,100
I dashed!

2048
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:23,670
Coming soon!

2049
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:29,830
I don't even remember where this demo ends.

2050
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:32,250
Like I said, I was always too chicken.

2051
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:36,490
I would see the zombies and I would be like...scary!

2052
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:38,870
Do you wanna buy it?

2053
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:41,790
I rate that a double BOOM!

2054
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:45,010
That was good.

2055
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:51,890
Well guys, this was a good...good amount of stuff.

2056
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:53,730
We got cool borders.

2057
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,650
We got these ones coming out.

2058
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:57,490
This is good stuff.

2059
01:52:57,650 --> 01:52:59,030
Are you guys ready for the next disc?

2060
01:53:05,190 --> 01:53:06,210
OK, give me a second.

2061
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:23,200
Oh yeah, this one is like super duper scraped up.

2062
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:27,960
I guess that's what I get for keeping it in a paper...

2063
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:32,100
In a paper...container.

2064
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,800
But this one has like...hold on.

2065
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,680
This one has basically no scratch marks on it.

2066
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:40,360
This next one.

2067
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,300
Reset!

2068
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:53,640
Yeah, it wasn't in the case.

2069
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:55,140
It wasn't not in the case.

2070
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,300
It was in the original little paper sleeve.

2071
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,160
But that's OK.

2072
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:01,160
Goodbye!

2073
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:08,400
I wonder if this one has...I've never...I've only bought this one, but I never have like tried it.

2074
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,760
I just bought it because I'm a collector.

2075
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:14,160
But I wonder if this one also has an intro.

2076
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:15,880
I'm excited.

2077
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:18,040
Oh this one is also PlayStation Underground!

2078
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:18,880
Let's go!

2079
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:23,520
Sampler.

2080
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,040
It's a hot lady.

2081
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:43,710
Oh my god!

2082
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:44,630
Spider!

2083
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:46,590
Oh my god!

2084
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:48,070
This is so Indiana Jones.

2085
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:52,010
Is it Tomb Raider?

2086
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:58,230
Everybody is dead here.

2087
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:00,130
Everybody is dead here.

2088
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:01,090
Oh good thing there is an exit.

2089
01:55:01,990 --> 01:55:02,630
Oh my god!

2090
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:06,130
Wait, we are like in a suit.

2091
01:55:06,990 --> 01:55:07,490
What the hell?

2092
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:13,210
I'm cradling my precious PlayStation Underground.

2093
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,220
Dude Raider.

2094
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:27,400
Why are we dressed up like 007?

2095
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:47,160
Oh yeah!

2096
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,500
PlayStation Underground!

2097
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:57,960
Oh damn.

2098
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,640
This guy is beefed up.

2099
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:11,120
Now we are Terminator?

2100
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:12,780
No.

2101
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:15,520
What?

2102
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:21,250
Debriefing.

2103
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:23,270
Spyro the Dragon.

2104
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:26,570
Developers tell all.

2105
01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:28,090
Oh my god.

2106
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:30,150
What a transition.

2107
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:35,150
I'm getting whiplash every second here.

2108
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:40,310
I'm very curious.

2109
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:45,170
Well guys, we just did Medieval 2.

2110
01:56:46,430 --> 01:56:50,250
Did you know that there is also Medieval 1 on this disc?

2111
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:52,310
But also...

2112
01:56:54,370 --> 01:56:55,730
Download station.

2113
01:56:56,170 --> 01:56:57,870
Gran Turismo Tekken 3?

2114
01:56:58,450 --> 01:56:59,570
What is that one?

2115
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:00,170
I can't read it.

2116
01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:00,570
Vice?

2117
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:05,970
I can't read it.

2118
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:08,110
Tekken 3.

2119
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:13,690
Oh, Vigilante A.

2120
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:17,610
Project Wormhole.

2121
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:20,310
I love how this is R&D.

2122
01:57:21,130 --> 01:57:22,330
Code Archive.

2123
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:23,730
What the hell are these?

2124
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:25,370
The Vault?

2125
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:28,750
What do I pick?

2126
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,800
Cheat codes.

2127
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:38,340
Who would do... Hold on.

2128
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,480
I want to see the debriefing.

2129
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:40,180
What is this?

2130
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,080
He was so gentle about it.

2131
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:01,800
Spyro the Dragon.

2132
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,300
I can't read anything.

2133
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:17,920
This guy is such a nerd.

2134
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:22,760
How do you end up with a video game world that pulls you in?

2135
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:24,720
How can you make it stand out from other games?

2136
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:27,720
Your team will hit development walls and have to search for breakthroughs.

2137
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:30,640
Here is the inside story of the making of Spyro the Dragon.

2138
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:32,680
Oh my God!

2139
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:33,480
Get his ass!

2140
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:34,160
Yeah!

2141
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:37,020
Ted!

2142
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:44,180
The hardest part was coming up with what we were making.

2143
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:52,880
The animation of a Tyrannosaurus Rex with wings and breathes fire.

2144
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,680
You got the best of everything in the dragon.

2145
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,520
Do you think he has a tattoo of it?

2146
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:01,820
Do you think he had those Hawaiian dragon T-shirts?

2147
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,060
Damn, this guy loves dragons.

2148
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,080
This guy loves dragons.

2149
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:21,760
Nasty!

2150
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,760
Oh, we can hear Spyro talking.

2151
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:32,080
Which one is this?

2152
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,080
Is this Spyro 1?

2153
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,200
Oh, the green screen.

2154
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:41,540
Spyro 1.

2155
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:41,900
Wow!

2156
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,840
Alex, you don't have to do the interview.

2157
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:09,100
Someone just get an Alex actor.

2158
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,860
Flower case style.

2159
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:19,380
I can't understand what he is saying.

2160
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:28,600
This guy is just like, do I really have to be part of the interview?

2161
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,500
Oh my God!

2162
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,560
Somebody save Alex!

2163
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:44,460
Wow, that guy is so awesome looking.

2164
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:47,880
It's a sheep!

2165
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:51,460
No way!

2166
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,740
That's so sad!

2167
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:02,460
Of all people who laugh so hard at someone being shy, it's because he is so... I feel bad for him.

2168
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,440
That's why I'm laughing.

2169
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:07,880
Look at 90's people.

2170
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,280
I can't... I can't hear him.

2171
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,920
They just were like, yeah that's the take.

2172
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,300
Oh Alex, you are a freak.

2173
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:30,020
Oh, I hate the flying levels.

2174
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:33,060
What?

2175
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:33,740
What did you say?

2176
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:41,100
He got really excited about the flying levels.

2177
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,260
I didn't like the flying levels.

2178
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:46,380
I'm not very good at them.

2179
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:50,540
Thanks for playing these classics from my childhood.

2180
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:51,180
Of course!

2181
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:04,340
Why is he saying it so sensual like that?

2182
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:15,740
In every single place where you can dash, there is a secret place.

2183
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:24,320
Oh it's the original Spyro.

2184
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:24,980
That's right.

2185
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,760
You guys said it wasn't Tom Kenny.

2186
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:28,960
That's his name right?

2187
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,100
Crash Bandicoot!

2188
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:34,960
Taco Bell Chihuahua!

2189
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:50,000
My credits are Crash Bandicoot and Taco Bell Chihuahua.

2190
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,040
They look nice.

2191
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:56,200
This is so awesome.

2192
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:07,020
Starship Troopers?

2193
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,180
Highlander?

2194
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:10,180
Wow!

2195
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,240
You used to try to speedrun this game?

2196
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:14,200
Because I didn't have a memory card.

2197
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:15,480
Oh my gosh!

2198
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:20,020
Here I take your hard core.

2199
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:25,360
Stop bullying the team?

2200
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,360
No, I'm not bullying!

2201
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:28,300
I love this!

2202
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:31,980
Wait, that's Mr. Krabs!

2203
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:32,600
What?

2204
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:33,540
I forgot?

2205
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:47,880
Oh God!

2206
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,920
I forgot that he was Mr. Krabs.

2207
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:54,080
Why didn't they credit that Mr. Krabs?

2208
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:56,840
Early Fall.

2209
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:58,720
Try the demo in the vault.

2210
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:05,340
And then we have behind the scenes of Crash Bandicoot.

2211
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:06,560
What is this?

2212
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:07,100
Warped?

2213
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:09,780
Crash Bandicoot Warped?

2214
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:10,600
Yes.

2215
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:12,880
Download station.

2216
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:15,320
Research and development.

2217
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,180
Code archive.

2218
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:17,760
It's the vault!

2219
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,240
This is where we get all the games.

2220
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:20,100
Alright guys.

2221
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:36,540
I didn't think it would just show up like that.

2222
02:04:44,450 --> 02:04:45,870
Spiral the Dragon.

2223
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:47,530
A bug's life!

2224
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:51,410
Also, there is something really cool on this.

2225
02:04:51,590 --> 02:04:53,550
The chat is kind of covering it.

2226
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:54,210
But do you see that?

2227
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:55,290
It's called imports.

2228
02:04:57,290 --> 02:04:58,690
There is just one.

2229
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:05,470
But they have one single Japanese game on here which I think is kind of really neat.

2230
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:08,550
Medieval 1?

2231
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:09,010
Wow.

2232
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:11,030
Tomb Raider 3?

2233
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:19,170
Metal Gear Solid?

2234
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:20,470
I don't know.

2235
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:21,990
I never heard of that one before.

2236
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:24,290
Cooler Borders 3.

2237
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:26,690
Small Soldiers.

2238
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:29,510
NFL Game Day 99.

2239
02:05:30,730 --> 02:05:32,590
NHL Face Off 99.

2240
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:34,470
Rallycross 2.

2241
02:05:35,090 --> 02:05:38,970
Sounds dumb, don't play it.

2242
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:47,910
We did the Spiral... It was Spiral 3, but we did Spiral in the last one.

2243
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:51,750
I'm kind of really curious about a bug's life.

2244
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:56,650
Actually, I want to try Iida Bull first.

2245
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:07,230
The PlayStation though wasn't region locked.

2246
02:06:20,690 --> 02:06:21,590
It was?

2247
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:24,290
The PS1 was?

2248
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:26,570
Was the PS2 region locked?

2249
02:06:27,230 --> 02:06:28,010
It was?

2250
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:34,720
Hold on, I'm going to do what was here.

2251
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:36,760
Circle, square, circle, square.

2252
02:06:44,210 --> 02:06:45,270
In the ball?

2253
02:06:45,390 --> 02:06:45,910
Are you sure?

2254
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:49,930
Oh, in the main menu.

2255
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:53,750
How do I get out of here?

2256
02:06:58,790 --> 02:07:00,210
PS1 and PS2 were region locked.

2257
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:01,350
I don't remember that at all.

2258
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:05,230
Circle, square, circle, square.

2259
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:14,960
It's not working.

2260
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,940
Also, the next time you want to get my attention about something...

2261
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:28,340
Don't send it in all caps, please.

2262
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:31,820
Just looks like you're shouting at me.

2263
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:33,800
One

2264
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:39,660
guy, okay.

2265
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:44,840
Gonna put you in time out.

2266
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:51,320
That one military game looks cool, Small Soldiers.

2267
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:53,080
I want to play, I want to try that one too.

2268
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:54,340
Wait, import.

2269
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:05,880
Start.

2270
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:11,160
I can't see small letters without my glasses.

2271
02:08:18,420 --> 02:08:21,640
Wait, so they didn't translate any of it?

2272
02:08:28,130 --> 02:08:28,940
Yume janai?

2273
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:40,140
Nihongo.

2274
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:50,980
I don't even know what type of game this is.

2275
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,240
I swear I'm not lying.

2276
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:55,120
I'm telling you...

2277
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:57,840
I'm telling you, it didn't work though.

2278
02:08:59,260 --> 02:08:59,680
Circle.

2279
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:05,420
One player versus...

2280
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:06,000
Oh, we can't do it.

2281
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:06,940
We can only do one player.

2282
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:09,680
I forgot.

2283
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:10,760
Oh, it's JP control.

2284
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,160
So now circle is...

2285
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:15,360
X is modoru.

2286
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:28,540
Plastic?

2287
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:30,220
What is this game?

2288
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:32,000
They're like, select your challenge.

2289
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:33,680
I don't even know what these...

2290
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:34,840
AI version?

2291
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,020
I can't do that one.

2292
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:38,520
Television version.

2293
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:38,880
What?

2294
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:40,340
Final?

2295
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:42,200
Maybe we shouldn't do final.

2296
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:44,160
Okay, let's just do special preview.

2297
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:45,680
What is this?

2298
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:53,440
The practice.

2299
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,500
What am I doing?

2300
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:09,410
I don't need a replay.

2301
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:10,230
Thank you.

2302
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:17,700
Oh gosh, there is a time limit.

2303
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:18,440
Oh my god.

2304
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:19,680
It's so sensitive.

2305
02:10:19,820 --> 02:10:21,440
My controller is so sensitive though.

2306
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:29,700
It's just practice.

2307
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:33,240
It's just a practice.

2308
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:33,940
Oh my gosh.

2309
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:34,980
Oh my god.

2310
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:36,000
Okay.

2311
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:38,760
Oh my god.

2312
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:42,860
It's so loud.

2313
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,560
It scares me.

2314
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:49,140
It is cool the way it like...

2315
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:50,340
turns, right?

2316
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:33,410
Do we get to...

2317
02:11:33,410 --> 02:11:34,590
try the other course?

2318
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,400
Or does it kick us out?

2319
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:41,340
Minto Ichiban.

2320
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:43,180
Why did it send us...

2321
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:46,360
Why did it send us all the way back to the very beginning?

2322
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:48,100
Why did it do that?

2323
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:53,600
I played this when I was a kid.

2324
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:54,320
This is insane.

2325
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:55,640
I thought it was all a dream.

2326
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:00,120
Evan, what did you say?

2327
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,140
What did you say?

2328
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:05,240
Yo, we playing...

2329
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,400
Actually...

2330
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:09,360
Oh no, it didn't have Tony Hawk.

2331
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,900
Or wait, maybe one of them does.

2332
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:13,700
Hold on.

2333
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:19,920
Why do every single one of these have Spyro on it?

2334
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:25,520
Maybe I should have started this one.

2335
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:27,920
Because maybe I should have gone in like...

2336
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,100
order of gear, right?

2337
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:37,900
Let's try that tiny soldier one.

2338
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:43,450
Spyro is big.

2339
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:44,890
I mean, I love Spyro.

2340
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:45,510
Oh wait.

2341
02:12:45,790 --> 02:12:46,910
I wanna play A Bug's Life.

2342
02:12:48,750 --> 02:12:49,830
I wanna play it.

2343
02:12:49,870 --> 02:12:50,450
Oh my goodness.

2344
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:55,330
Throw berries.

2345
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:56,590
Pick up seeds.

2346
02:12:56,830 --> 02:12:58,390
Throw berries when they are being carried.

2347
02:12:59,250 --> 02:13:00,650
Change seed color.

2348
02:13:02,370 --> 02:13:04,890
When holding or hand standing on a seed.

2349
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:09,090
Or you jump.

2350
02:13:10,030 --> 02:13:12,270
It's both changing the seed color and jumping.

2351
02:13:13,890 --> 02:13:15,010
R1, kick.

2352
02:13:15,510 --> 02:13:16,910
R1 plus square is kick.

2353
02:13:16,910 --> 02:13:19,010
Why can't square just be kick?

2354
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:21,190
Oh wait, because square is throw the berries.

2355
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:23,970
Well, what does circle do then?

2356
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:26,510
Why can't circle be kick the enemies?

2357
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:29,250
Okay, whatever.

2358
02:13:32,830 --> 02:13:34,610
I've never played this before.

2359
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:40,130
Did you ever watch the Small Soldiers movie?

2360
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:41,870
I don't think so.

2361
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:44,490
TLDR.

2362
02:13:44,490 --> 02:13:45,090
TLDR.

2363
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:46,190
Berries.

2364
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:47,090
Oh wow.

2365
02:13:47,970 --> 02:13:48,830
Traveller's Tales.

2366
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:52,050
How many of these companies are like gone now, you know?

2367
02:13:54,810 --> 02:13:55,730
More Disney.

2368
02:13:55,850 --> 02:13:58,110
Oh wait, are we gonna get a trailer for A Bug's Life 2?

2369
02:14:02,150 --> 02:14:02,670
Nope.

2370
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:04,490
They hate us.

2371
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:08,840
Level 1.

2372
02:14:08,980 --> 02:14:10,060
Welcome to Ant Island.

2373
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:12,000
Find the entrance to the Ant Hill.

2374
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:13,280
It's the whole level.

2375
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:19,380
They make Lego games.

2376
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,640
Okay, start.

2377
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:27,740
Oh my gosh, I used to have a plushie of this character.

2378
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:31,640
Am I killing that ant right there?

2379
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,020
Is that a bad ant?

2380
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:35,180
He looks kind of vicious.

2381
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:36,780
Oh my god.

2382
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:39,580
Oh wait, it's...

2383
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:40,280
R1.

2384
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:41,820
Oh damn!

2385
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,740
We hate those ants.

2386
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:45,940
Okay, how do I move the camera?

2387
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:49,520
Wait, actually, how do I move the camera?

2388
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,140
Excuse me, I can't turn around.

2389
02:14:58,080 --> 02:14:59,620
I can't turn around.

2390
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:01,760
Oh my god.

2391
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:04,480
He's trying to get me to turn, but I literally...

2392
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:05,300
Oh there we go.

2393
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:06,160
Okay, okay.

2394
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:07,280
Oh god.

2395
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:10,160
It's... I was using analog stick.

2396
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:10,740
I'm an idiot.

2397
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:11,500
Sorry guys.

2398
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:12,820
Where's the entrance?

2399
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:14,420
Oh god, this game is making me dizzy.

2400
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:15,540
Oh no.

2401
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:16,480
Oh my god.

2402
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:17,180
Is this a seed?

2403
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:18,540
Take the seed.

2404
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:20,240
I got it!

2405
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:24,340
Throw!

2406
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:27,520
Oh my god!

2407
02:15:30,770 --> 02:15:31,890
This is an asshole.

2408
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:34,990
I think I saw a cricket over here.

2409
02:15:35,070 --> 02:15:36,450
Aren't those the bad guys in the movie?

2410
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:39,470
Oh my god.

2411
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:41,190
Why is this so terrible?

2412
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:47,340
This is so...

2413
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:51,560
This is the worst game I've ever played in my entire afterlife!

2414
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:52,900
Oh god!

2415
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:57,260
She's following me.

2416
02:15:57,780 --> 02:15:58,700
What is this?

2417
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:00,020
Is this water?

2418
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:06,180
No, this game is good.

2419
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:06,920
It is?

2420
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:08,740
Okay.

2421
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:11,320
Oh god.

2422
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:14,520
Oh, it showed me where the entrance is, I think.

2423
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:16,700
How do I not know how to go home?

2424
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,820
Oh yes, there's a cricket.

2425
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:25,560
Okay, I can throw berries at him.

2426
02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:26,900
Oh, this guy too.

2427
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:30,140
Oh, kill him, kill him, kill him.

2428
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,160
Give me a...

2429
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:32,540
Okay!

2430
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:36,980
Okay, we collect our name.

2431
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:38,080
Oh my god, please.

2432
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:42,780
Oh, there's a golden berry there.

2433
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:44,780
Do you think I can jump?

2434
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:45,780
Do you think I can reach it?

2435
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,100
Everything's out to kill me!

2436
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:53,440
I'm just an ant!

2437
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:58,400
Good thing there's no fall damage.

2438
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:02,480
This game is making me actually so sick.

2439
02:17:06,660 --> 02:17:07,580
Oh jeez.

2440
02:17:07,580 --> 02:17:11,780
Oh, I killed his ass before he could even touch me.

2441
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:12,720
I'm gonna eat this...

2442
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:13,420
What is this?

2443
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,640
I don't know what that is.

2444
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:19,440
This game is confusing!

2445
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:26,140
Am I supposed to take the seeds or...?

2446
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:29,820
Yeah, stay away from me.

2447
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:32,060
You're ants that we hate.

2448
02:17:32,300 --> 02:17:33,340
We hate these ants.

2449
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:34,920
These ants suck.

2450
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:39,180
Oh wait, that's another number... number... letter.

2451
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:43,160
Oh my god, why is the camera so bad?

2452
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,100
Please.

2453
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:58,080
Do you jump on the seed?

2454
02:17:58,260 --> 02:17:59,040
I don't know.

2455
02:17:59,180 --> 02:18:00,360
I can't jump on these.

2456
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:02,100
Oh my god.

2457
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:05,820
Okay, pick up this.

2458
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:10,720
Walk over here before the guy comes back.

2459
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:12,200
Wait, oh no.

2460
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:14,860
What?

2461
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:17,540
Oh, what the hell just happened?

2462
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,440
This is so...

2463
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:24,580
Yes!

2464
02:18:24,820 --> 02:18:25,400
We got it!

2465
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:26,500
Oh my god.

2466
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,140
Hardest boss of PS1 is the camera.

2467
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:31,400
You know what?

2468
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:31,780
Screw it.

2469
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:33,300
I don't care about whatever the hell that is.

2470
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,500
I'll go hungry before I deal with any of this shit.

2471
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:38,340
I swear.

2472
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:38,520
I swear.

2473
02:18:55,130 --> 02:18:57,710
Suddenly a horror game for real.

2474
02:19:00,690 --> 02:19:01,770
Oh god.

2475
02:19:01,970 --> 02:19:03,050
Oh, it's horrible.

2476
02:19:05,570 --> 02:19:06,110
What

2477
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:11,210
is that?

2478
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:12,710
Every time I see it, it disappears.

2479
02:19:16,710 --> 02:19:17,950
I'm a dead ant.

2480
02:19:18,710 --> 02:19:20,590
I've been pesticide.

2481
02:19:20,950 --> 02:19:25,070
I'm actually gonna commit pesticide right now if I have to keep playing this game.

2482
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:27,430
Don't let me inside my home!

2483
02:19:28,090 --> 02:19:28,650
Please!

2484
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:36,680
Oh god.

2485
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:39,520
I can't see anything.

2486
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:43,880
This is the worst game ever.

2487
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:47,140
Who said this was peak?

2488
02:19:47,140 --> 02:19:48,100
Oh!

2489
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:52,380
We are so close to spelling!

2490
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:59,380
This camera is so terrible.

2491
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:01,440
What is this?

2492
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:08,920
What the hell is that?

2493
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:14,460
And where is the last...oh, hold on.

2494
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:17,700
Okay, thanks for the berry.

2495
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:20,120
I already saw that because I'm not blind.

2496
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:24,820
Even my prepubescent mind could tell this game was horrible.

2497
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:26,720
Are you guys enjoying this game?

2498
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:30,700
Do you have fun becoming a little ant?

2499
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:32,020
Are you feeling really immersed?

2500
02:20:37,130 --> 02:20:39,050
Are you feeling so immersed?

2501
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:41,050
What the hell does this thing do?

2502
02:20:41,670 --> 02:20:42,970
Does it pick up that?

2503
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:46,150
What is this thing?

2504
02:20:47,370 --> 02:20:49,310
And I can't attack while I'm in it.

2505
02:20:49,530 --> 02:20:50,990
Oh my god, he's coming for me.

2506
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:09,620
Okay.

2507
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:16,910
It's starting to lag.

2508
02:21:18,250 --> 02:21:20,150
The way the bugs explode is funny.

2509
02:21:22,110 --> 02:21:23,990
And what is this girl doing up here?

2510
02:21:24,050 --> 02:21:24,890
What is she doing?

2511
02:21:25,950 --> 02:21:27,370
What do I do with you?

2512
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:29,150
What do you want from me?

2513
02:21:29,150 --> 02:21:29,390
I don't like it.

2514
02:21:34,510 --> 02:21:37,890
If you're trying to help me, you're not doing a very good job.

2515
02:21:39,690 --> 02:21:41,210
What the hell am I doing?

2516
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:44,150
What is going on?

2517
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:48,980
Oh, that's right.

2518
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,620
I can change the seed color.

2519
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:54,860
And then I hop on top of it and something else happens.

2520
02:21:55,060 --> 02:21:55,520
Oh my god.

2521
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:59,380
It turned into...

2522
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:02,800
What?

2523
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:04,060
Oh, what?

2524
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:08,670
Huh?

2525
02:22:18,450 --> 02:22:19,690
Oh, we did it.

2526
02:22:20,130 --> 02:22:22,330
Oh, we finally made it somewhere else.

2527
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:27,910
This guy looks really freaked out.

2528
02:22:30,170 --> 02:22:32,370
Like, he looks like he's seen things.

2529
02:22:32,930 --> 02:22:34,190
And honestly, I have.

2530
02:22:35,490 --> 02:22:37,170
I don't want to be an ant anymore.

2531
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:37,930
This sucks.

2532
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:40,710
Being an ant is like... Oh my god.

2533
02:22:41,450 --> 02:22:42,830
Yeah, kill that guy.

2534
02:22:43,930 --> 02:22:46,150
Wait, where's the last letter of my name?

2535
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:53,150
I'm never gonna beat this game.

2536
02:22:54,710 --> 02:22:56,130
I've never... You know what?

2537
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,850
Let's just go inside.

2538
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:58,090
And then I'll beat it.

2539
02:22:58,090 --> 02:22:59,930
Let's just... Chapter 1.

2540
02:23:02,110 --> 02:23:03,170
Let me in!

2541
02:23:03,790 --> 02:23:04,890
Let me in!

2542
02:24:01,470 --> 02:24:03,450
It was so worth it.

2543
02:24:13,630 --> 02:24:14,570
Oh, it hurts.

2544
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:18,850
Wait, what happens when you finish the Metal Gear one, I wonder.

2545
02:24:20,670 --> 02:24:21,530
Oh gosh.

2546
02:24:22,190 --> 02:24:23,610
Sorry for one guying you, Minto.

2547
02:24:23,770 --> 02:24:24,850
Video proof is here.

2548
02:24:25,710 --> 02:24:29,350
Oh, code is square, circle, square, square, square.

2549
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:31,170
But it might be copyright.

2550
02:24:32,150 --> 02:24:34,170
So play like 10 seconds...

2551
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:37,710
You are so close.

2552
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:39,870
So square, circle, square, square, square.

2553
02:24:40,410 --> 02:24:42,230
The same thing, but with Snake's face.

2554
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:49,400
How did that get past quality control?

2555
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:51,480
I'm surprised Disney approved of that.

2556
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:57,860
Oh gosh, someone spent their whole afternoon making that screen.

2557
02:24:58,020 --> 02:25:01,480
So that 26 years later would become beat comedy on it.

2558
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:04,700
It looks like a shit post for real.

2559
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:06,980
Oh my god.

2560
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:15,560
I want to see... I wasn't actually going to play the Metal Gear demo.

2561
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:17,520
But I'm so curious.

2562
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:20,640
I'm so curious.

2563
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:26,700
What was I saying?

2564
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:31,140
I'm so curious what the level complete looks like.

2565
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:33,440
Did we get the full intro and everything?

2566
02:25:33,860 --> 02:25:37,940
I just bought this because I was like...

2567
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:42,020
You are about to play a demonstration version of Metal Gear Solid.

2568
02:25:48,690 --> 02:25:51,170
The fuck did you do to the camera in Bugs Life?

2569
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:52,410
It's not meant to look like that.

2570
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:53,450
I didn't do anything!

2571
02:25:56,090 --> 02:25:57,230
I didn't do anything!

2572
02:25:57,230 --> 02:25:59,070
Are we going to get the full intro?

2573
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:09,930
A Hideo Kojima game.

2574
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:14,150
No way.

2575
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:17,750
Oh my gosh.

2576
02:26:21,790 --> 02:26:23,110
We actually get the intro?

2577
02:26:23,350 --> 02:26:24,050
That's crazy.

2578
02:26:27,770 --> 02:26:31,470
I kind of want to skip it because I want to get into the game, but I don't want to skip it at the same time.

2579
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:43,130
I'm surprised it's in English.

2580
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:47,610
I'm surprised it's in English actually.

2581
02:27:03,690 --> 02:27:04,530
What?

2582
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:15,210
Holy shit!

2583
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:24,690
No, that's not Solid Snake.

2584
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:36,830
Oh my gosh.

2585
02:27:37,510 --> 02:27:41,430
The actual stage name.

2586
02:27:44,730 --> 02:27:46,970
The actual stage name.

2587
02:27:49,790 --> 02:27:50,950
Boom.

2588
02:27:57,830 --> 02:28:03,090
This is...Coming to this from Bugs Life is actual whiplash.

2589
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:11,970
It's actually such like a...

2590
02:28:12,970 --> 02:28:20,290
I can't believe this demo disc has Metal Gear Solid and then a Bugs Life.

2591
02:28:20,590 --> 02:28:21,730
And Shaman.

2592
02:28:26,590 --> 02:28:29,690
Sean Baker is the name of the protagonist.

2593
02:28:30,930 --> 02:28:32,730
Oh my gosh!

2594
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:36,970
Yes!

2595
02:28:38,230 --> 02:28:40,430
There's also some MGS1 demos in JP.

2596
02:28:40,930 --> 02:28:42,490
Oh, depending on which demos you got.

2597
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:44,710
I knew there were some in Japanese.

2598
02:28:50,350 --> 02:28:52,710
One man infiltration mission baby!

2599
02:28:57,010 --> 02:28:57,570
OSP.

2600
02:29:01,170 --> 02:29:03,410
How far does the demo go I wonder.

2601
02:29:06,970 --> 02:29:08,970
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo.

2602
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:14,010
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo.

2603
02:29:14,010 --> 02:29:15,310
We should put it in...

2604
02:29:20,650 --> 02:29:21,670
Oh my god.

2605
02:29:23,830 --> 02:29:25,830
I'm just like imagining a kid...

2606
02:29:27,730 --> 02:29:28,210
Like...

2607
02:29:28,210 --> 02:29:29,390
Starting this up.

2608
02:29:29,910 --> 02:29:31,290
And it's just so amazing.

2609
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:32,290
You know?

2610
02:29:33,150 --> 02:29:34,490
Oh, there's only no game.

2611
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:39,250
There's nothing else on the menu.

2612
02:29:41,670 --> 02:29:44,550
Oh my gosh, Sean Baker!

2613
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:08,220
He's got that dog in him.

2614
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:08,980
Yeah.

2615
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:11,580
Oh, Doug Stone is Doug Stone?

2616
02:30:11,580 --> 02:30:12,980
Steal it.

2617
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:14,500
He'll be through me.

2618
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:16,080
I know it.

2619
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:20,420
I'm going to swat down a couple of bothersome flies.

2620
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:23,980
I can't.

2621
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,020
I can't.

2622
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:29,800
This is just so amazing.

2623
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:31,440
And then you have a Bugs Life!

2624
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:35,840
Bugs Life literally gave me motion sickness.

2625
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:38,320
And then you have Liquid.

2626
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:41,680
You have like the best game ever.

2627
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:44,500
And then a Bugs Life on the same disc.

2628
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:46,940
I want to cry.

2629
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:48,500
Guys, I'm sorry.

2630
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:49,980
I think I'm going to skip the codex.

2631
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:51,260
Which I never would do.

2632
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:54,720
Can I skip them?

2633
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:55,480
Oh, yeah.

2634
02:30:56,300 --> 02:30:57,260
I want to get through it.

2635
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:03,780
I want to see where the demo goes until.

2636
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:09,040
Swim.

2637
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:09,300
Swim.

2638
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:09,560
Swim.

2639
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:09,800
Swim.

2640
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:10,040
Swim.

2641
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:20,140
Oh no, don't expect any speedruns.

2642
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:23,280
Someone is going to come in and be like, why the hell is she playing Metal Gear Solid?

2643
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:28,540
Going to be like, why the hell is she playing Metal Gear Solid?

2644
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:29,460
I can't with this girl.

2645
02:31:40,070 --> 02:31:40,330
Yeah!

2646
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:50,980
I saw nothing.

2647
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:54,580
Don't worry about it.

2648
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:55,980
Oh god, he did see me!

2649
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:01,540
Oh shit.

2650
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:02,880
Don't kill me please.

2651
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:05,260
Don't kill me please.

2652
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:06,740
Don't kill me!

2653
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:08,520
I just want to play the demo!

2654
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:12,500
Don't kill me!

2655
02:32:12,700 --> 02:32:13,880
I just want to play the demo!

2656
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:16,100
You can play the bug's life!

2657
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:21,820
There he is.

2658
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:25,380
Oh, we're waiting.

2659
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:28,000
We're waiting.

2660
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:30,440
Come here.

2661
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:37,380
Let me satchel my rations just in case.

2662
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:38,300
Oh shit!

2663
02:32:47,190 --> 02:32:48,530
We're so fine everybody.

2664
02:32:50,470 --> 02:32:50,970
Oh shit.

2665
02:32:50,970 --> 02:32:52,470
There it is.

2666
02:32:53,690 --> 02:32:55,390
It's like, when is this going to calm down?

2667
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:57,850
Just like old times.

2668
02:32:57,890 --> 02:32:58,410
Of course!

2669
02:33:00,130 --> 02:33:01,870
They didn't even notice that I killed a man.

2670
02:33:08,110 --> 02:33:09,470
Alright, get out of here mister.

2671
02:33:11,190 --> 02:33:12,290
Oh shit, don't see me.

2672
02:33:15,050 --> 02:33:15,690
I'm running.

2673
02:33:20,170 --> 02:33:21,570
When does this game come out?

2674
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:22,410
Game of the year!

2675
02:33:22,490 --> 02:33:23,270
Game of the year!

2676
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:33,080
Sorry.

2677
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:36,380
It doesn't slow down one bit.

2678
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:41,920
It feels wrong.

2679
02:33:42,040 --> 02:33:43,400
I never skip cutscenes.

2680
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:47,140
I never skip cutscenes in Metal Gear.

2681
02:33:48,220 --> 02:33:49,600
Mintos playing Metal Gear again!

2682
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:54,820
But otherwise it's going to be so long.

2683
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:56,920
I have so many games to get through.

2684
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:00,880
I wonder, I can't tell when, how...

2685
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:02,100
How...

2686
02:34:02,820 --> 02:34:03,300
How...

2687
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:08,980
How long of a demo this...

2688
02:34:08,980 --> 02:34:10,840
Like, where would be a good stopping point?

2689
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:15,780
Maybe getting into the warehouse?

2690
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:18,120
No, that feels too short, right?

2691
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:22,760
When you get to the vents?

2692
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:24,020
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

2693
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:24,900
I don't know.

2694
02:34:31,620 --> 02:34:33,120
Must be timed.

2695
02:34:33,220 --> 02:34:34,300
Do you think it's timed instead?

2696
02:34:34,980 --> 02:34:37,040
If we just ran around and be silly?

2697
02:34:43,410 --> 02:34:44,770
Whose footsteps are these?

2698
02:34:45,830 --> 02:34:46,810
The vents.

2699
02:34:47,410 --> 02:34:48,750
The demo ends after Meryl.

2700
02:34:49,810 --> 02:34:50,350
Meryl!

2701
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:53,470
Oh my gosh, that feels so long.

2702
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:04,140
Oh shit.

2703
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:06,040
Nobodies.

2704
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:08,940
Oh shit.

2705
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:10,140
Let's grab that.

2706
02:35:11,060 --> 02:35:11,320
No!

2707
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:19,840
That guy is like coming right back!

2708
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:28,820
I got my gun.

2709
02:35:34,980 --> 02:35:35,500
Anyway...

2710
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:44,620
My heartbeat.

2711
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:46,300
Oh no!

2712
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:47,400
I can go back and get the ration.

2713
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:49,680
I think I'm lazy.

2714
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:52,080
I think I'm lazy.

2715
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:55,980
I was never even here.

2716
02:35:57,960 --> 02:35:59,260
Oh gosh.

2717
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:10,160
Please unequip.

2718
02:36:10,340 --> 02:36:10,700
Thank you.

2719
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:16,260
Where

2720
02:36:19,740 --> 02:36:21,040
is the guy?

2721
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:26,530
Where is the guy at?

2722
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:29,710
Our sleepy guy.

2723
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:32,250
What a demo.

2724
02:36:33,210 --> 02:36:33,850
Nice.

2725
02:36:37,270 --> 02:36:37,730
Wow.

2726
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:40,490
He's on vacation.

2727
02:36:41,410 --> 02:36:42,810
Oh, because I set off the alarm.

2728
02:36:46,870 --> 02:36:48,390
He's doing his own thing.

2729
02:36:49,230 --> 02:36:50,110
He doesn't...wow.

2730
02:36:50,850 --> 02:36:51,650
He doesn't need me.

2731
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,660
By the way, the demo has a full codec call.

2732
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:02,060
This is craziness.

2733
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:04,500
We are about to hear Master.

2734
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:06,480
Master is coming in!

2735
02:37:20,060 --> 02:37:21,520
Follow the rat.

2736
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:24,520
I can't believe Mint tricked me into watching her play Metal Gear again.

2737
02:37:26,900 --> 02:37:27,880
Master Miller!

2738
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:31,000
Master.

2739
02:37:41,980 --> 02:37:43,400
McDonald's Miller.

2740
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:49,020
Master McDonald's.

2741
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:54,020
That guy's got some really sick glasses.

2742
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:58,960
Guys, I'm just so curious.

2743
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:00,840
What does the end of the demo look like?

2744
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:04,760
This is different than the one I had.

2745
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:06,000
Mine's had JP voices.

2746
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:07,500
Ended as soon as you entered the vent.

2747
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:11,480
Interesting.

2748
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:13,660
Oh, so it's a mystery.

2749
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:16,800
It's a mystery.

2750
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:18,300
Where is the guy?

2751
02:38:18,740 --> 02:38:19,600
I hear him.

2752
02:38:26,130 --> 02:38:28,090
I love the ambiance here.

2753
02:38:29,210 --> 02:38:31,570
I wish I had a fork so I could eat these rats.

2754
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:37,190
Wait, what if I call Mei Ling?

2755
02:38:37,470 --> 02:38:39,070
Because I can't save, right?

2756
02:38:41,290 --> 02:38:43,230
Oh wait, that's right.

2757
02:38:43,410 --> 02:38:44,430
I'm in here.

2758
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:46,110
Oh wait!

2759
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:53,890
You can save here in the commercial version.

2760
02:39:05,730 --> 02:39:07,150
That's so funny!

2761
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:11,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2762
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:15,450
Buy the game everybody.

2763
02:39:15,610 --> 02:39:16,370
Buy the game.

2764
02:39:23,410 --> 02:39:24,970
Look for clues.

2765
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:26,870
Wait, where is this guy?

2766
02:39:27,190 --> 02:39:27,790
Oh, there he is.

2767
02:39:30,730 --> 02:39:31,890
He's not going to save me, right?

2768
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:34,250
Hello?

2769
02:39:38,170 --> 02:39:38,530
What?

2770
02:39:44,830 --> 02:39:45,590
Oh my god.

2771
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:47,470
Stop, stop, stop.

2772
02:39:47,470 --> 02:39:47,870
Go away.

2773
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:51,690
Do you think they'll hear me?

2774
02:39:52,510 --> 02:39:53,550
I wish I had a box.

2775
02:39:54,570 --> 02:39:55,370
Oh god.

2776
02:39:55,490 --> 02:39:56,750
Wait, this guy is coming up here.

2777
02:39:57,050 --> 02:39:59,950
No, we're fine.

2778
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:08,840
The box upstairs.

2779
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:10,060
Go away, mod.

2780
02:40:15,730 --> 02:40:17,050
Wait, so this is...

2781
02:40:17,890 --> 02:40:19,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2782
02:40:19,470 --> 02:40:20,510
The green dot.

2783
02:40:20,610 --> 02:40:23,630
Wait, so it might end at the diaper chief.

2784
02:40:25,450 --> 02:40:26,150
Bye bye.

2785
02:40:33,900 --> 02:40:34,760
Action button.

2786
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:36,220
Action button?

2787
02:40:38,840 --> 02:40:41,220
It looked like I couldn't go to B2.

2788
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:44,040
Because it was like grayed out.

2789
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:47,060
I didn't try though.

2790
02:40:47,540 --> 02:40:48,660
Let me go back and try.

2791
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:53,380
Before we get to the diaper chief, because that might be the end of the demo.

2792
02:40:55,700 --> 02:40:56,340
Take me now.

2793
02:40:58,240 --> 02:40:59,100
Let's go see.

2794
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:02,220
It's on purpose, right?

2795
02:41:02,500 --> 02:41:02,760
OK.

2796
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:05,460
I thought so.

2797
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:06,860
Oh my gosh.

2798
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:10,460
I'm just imagining how awesome this game is.

2799
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:14,040
And then you have a bug's life.

2800
02:41:15,900 --> 02:41:17,320
I can't get over it.

2801
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:22,420
Ah, see?

2802
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:24,180
Oh,

2803
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:36,100
it does have the vent here.

2804
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:38,280
I was going to say, wait, it was hard to tell...

2805
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:40,140
if the vent was there or not.

2806
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:42,620
It was hard to tell.

2807
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:46,820
Somebody out there is like, bug's life is better than Metal Gear Solid.

2808
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:52,080
Someone probably was like me and played a lot of a bug's life.

2809
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:54,440
And barely touched Metal Gear.

2810
02:42:06,970 --> 02:42:23,270
I love this game so much!

2811
02:42:24,060 --> 02:42:27,340
I don't know if we'll need these or not, but...

2812
02:42:29,010 --> 02:42:30,310
Johnny sounds congested.

2813
02:42:30,530 --> 02:42:32,110
I caught a damn cold.

2814
02:42:37,050 --> 02:42:37,750
Johnny...

2815
02:42:37,750 --> 02:42:39,710
That guy is a looker, man.

2816
02:42:40,650 --> 02:42:44,130
We never knew how hot Johnny was.

2817
02:42:44,670 --> 02:42:46,650
Until so many years later.

2818
02:42:48,230 --> 02:42:50,090
Until like a decade later.

2819
02:42:53,190 --> 02:42:54,330
Sexy lady.

2820
02:42:57,150 --> 02:42:58,590
Not him.

2821
02:43:00,030 --> 02:43:01,650
Dude's a goddamn dreamboat.

2822
02:43:02,070 --> 02:43:03,270
I know, that's what I'm saying.

2823
02:43:06,130 --> 02:43:07,870
Did we get this whole cutscene?

2824
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:12,610
Maybe it ends after Psycho Mantis?

2825
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:15,090
Because we can't even go to B2, so...

2826
02:43:20,950 --> 02:43:21,810
It's me.

2827
02:43:22,450 --> 02:43:23,710
Your worst nightmare.

2828
02:43:25,690 --> 02:43:28,290
Are you going to buy Metal Gear Solid after playing this demo?

2829
02:43:29,250 --> 02:43:29,650
I don't know.

2830
02:43:30,490 --> 02:43:31,690
He looks like a Lego person.

2831
02:43:31,790 --> 02:43:32,830
I'm just not into it.

2832
02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:35,950
It's the full game.

2833
02:43:45,430 --> 02:43:47,430
The graphics just don't look good.

2834
02:43:48,430 --> 02:43:50,490
Like I just don't think I can get into it.

2835
02:43:51,050 --> 02:43:51,430
You know?

2836
02:43:54,150 --> 02:43:56,130
The first hot girl with IVs.

2837
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:02,250
I feel like it will end after that scene where she gets into the elevator.

2838
02:44:02,410 --> 02:44:03,370
Yeah, probably, right?

2839
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:07,210
OK, I'm going to skip it you guys.

2840
02:44:07,270 --> 02:44:08,030
I'm going to skip it.

2841
02:44:08,170 --> 02:44:08,530
Sorry.

2842
02:44:08,910 --> 02:44:09,270
Sorry.

2843
02:44:09,410 --> 02:44:10,210
Oh it hurts!

2844
02:44:10,550 --> 02:44:12,510
We are not here to play Metal Gear Solid though.

2845
02:44:17,810 --> 02:44:18,590
You knew?

2846
02:44:20,150 --> 02:44:22,510
Metal Gear is one of the most secret black projects.

2847
02:44:23,310 --> 02:44:24,670
We are not here to play Metal Gear.

2848
02:44:25,350 --> 02:44:26,170
Metal Gear!

2849
02:44:31,810 --> 02:44:32,730
Hi Rex!

2850
02:44:32,890 --> 02:44:34,250
Oh my gosh, so cute.

2851
02:44:35,010 --> 02:44:36,650
I was actually...oh my gosh.

2852
02:44:37,690 --> 02:44:38,970
Keep going, keep going.

2853
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:40,990
Gosh, these cutscenes are crazy long.

2854
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:42,050
Oh my gosh.

2855
02:44:42,750 --> 02:44:44,430
This is like...

2856
02:44:44,430 --> 02:44:46,410
The kid is probably just like...

2857
02:44:46,410 --> 02:44:47,590
This is like a whole movie.

2858
02:44:47,690 --> 02:44:48,350
This is crazy.

2859
02:44:48,490 --> 02:44:48,990
Metal Gear.

2860
02:44:49,210 --> 02:44:50,310
What is this?

2861
02:44:51,450 --> 02:44:53,750
Ed Wattser, thank you so much for the 10th gift and thank you!

2862
02:44:58,090 --> 02:45:00,390
I just said no.

2863
02:45:03,890 --> 02:45:06,810
Hold on, I'm trying to fix something on my computer.

2864
02:45:08,730 --> 02:45:09,610
Oh, IVS!

2865
02:45:11,310 --> 02:45:12,710
Oh no, IVS!

2866
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:19,160
Woah!

2867
02:45:33,220 --> 02:45:34,800
So...sorry, I should have let it play out.

2868
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:37,600
So he dies and then that's the ending?

2869
02:45:38,300 --> 02:45:39,640
No way!

2870
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:45,160
Oh my gosh, he dies and that's such a cliffhanger.

2871
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:49,420
That's a good place.

2872
02:45:49,420 --> 02:45:53,540
That's a...actually I think that's a better place to end it than...

2873
02:45:53,540 --> 02:45:56,860
I think that's a better place to end it than at the elevator.

2874
02:45:59,240 --> 02:45:59,680
Wow!

2875
02:46:00,400 --> 02:46:02,780
Oh my gosh, I would have been so...

2876
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:05,760
I mean, I am foaming at the mouth, but...

2877
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:07,580
Oh my gosh!

2878
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:09,920
That would have been crazy!

2879
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:16,520
I'm kind of disappointed though that we didn't get Snake's face plastered all over the screen.

2880
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:18,740
It's kind of sad.

2881
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:19,780
How do I get out of here?

2882
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:21,740
Option?

2883
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:24,520
No?

2884
02:46:25,900 --> 02:46:26,320
Weak.

2885
02:46:26,320 --> 02:46:26,740
Strong.

2886
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:31,260
I played this demo disc with my dad.

2887
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:33,960
He would just endlessly try and run away from the guards.

2888
02:46:34,120 --> 02:46:36,280
He thought it was hilarious that cigarettes drained your health.

2889
02:46:36,380 --> 02:46:38,060
We both liked it more than Bugs Life.

2890
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:40,260
How do I get out of here?

2891
02:46:40,700 --> 02:46:41,340
Do I have to...oh.

2892
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:43,660
Wait.

2893
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:44,620
Uh-oh.

2894
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:46,940
I think I can get out from here.

2895
02:46:53,060 --> 02:46:53,860
I'm trapped!

2896
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:55,820
I'm trapped in a Metal Gear loop!

2897
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,260
Start and select at the same time.

2898
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:06,000
OK, thank you.

2899
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:12,640
I thought it was like select because the other games were just select, but then I was like wait a second, that's the codec!

2900
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:18,240
Metal Gear?

2901
02:47:18,820 --> 02:47:20,380
Metal Metal Gear Gear?

2902
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:22,620
Metal Metal Gear Gear?

2903
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:26,660
OK, so what was that cheat?

2904
02:47:32,940 --> 02:47:33,900
It was...circle...

2905
02:47:33,900 --> 02:47:36,060
Square, circle, square, square, square?

2906
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:51,300
Square, circle, square, square, square.

2907
02:47:56,430 --> 02:47:57,510
It didn't work.

2908
02:48:00,250 --> 02:48:02,850
Hold on, let me see if I can find the super chat.

2909
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:09,480
No.

2910
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:13,800
No, it's not showing me the super chats.

2911
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:16,780
On the demo menu.

2912
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:18,860
Oh, the demo menu.

2913
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:27,760
Wait, Agent, you're the one who knows!

2914
02:48:28,500 --> 02:48:29,900
You're the one who one-guide me!

2915
02:48:30,100 --> 02:48:30,720
What was it?

2916
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:36,560
Square, circle, square, square, square?

2917
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:37,280
Wait.

2918
02:48:39,400 --> 02:48:41,160
Square, circle, square, square, square.

2919
02:48:42,300 --> 02:48:43,060
I'm good to use.

2920
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:48,440
Liquidoki loves bug life.

2921
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:49,320
Yeah, she would.

2922
02:48:57,270 --> 02:48:58,270
I don't know.

2923
02:48:58,550 --> 02:48:59,590
Why don't we figure that out?

2924
02:49:01,590 --> 02:49:02,490
What else should we?

2925
02:49:02,550 --> 02:49:03,330
Oh, small soldiers!

2926
02:49:03,530 --> 02:49:04,350
I wanna try this one.

2927
02:49:07,010 --> 02:49:08,130
Weapon select.

2928
02:49:08,890 --> 02:49:09,450
Strife.

2929
02:49:10,590 --> 02:49:11,730
Select special weapon.

2930
02:49:12,010 --> 02:49:12,470
Deploy.

2931
02:49:12,910 --> 02:49:13,570
Use special weapon.

2932
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:14,310
Allies.

2933
02:49:14,610 --> 02:49:14,870
Jump.

2934
02:49:14,990 --> 02:49:15,310
Fire.

2935
02:49:16,630 --> 02:49:17,110
Move.

2936
02:49:18,130 --> 02:49:19,930
Directional aim weapon.

2937
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:20,630
Oh my goodness.

2938
02:49:23,590 --> 02:49:24,550
Let's try this.

2939
02:49:25,470 --> 02:49:27,050
I swear to god it was in that video I linked.

2940
02:49:27,310 --> 02:49:29,790
I can't open videos while I'm streaming!

2941
02:49:30,610 --> 02:49:31,530
Okay, please don't.

2942
02:49:31,750 --> 02:49:34,310
Okay, I might actually time you out because...

2943
02:49:35,850 --> 02:49:37,890
Because... You can't just send me a link.

2944
02:49:37,990 --> 02:49:38,850
That's not how this...

2945
02:49:39,930 --> 02:49:42,590
My entire monitor is the PlayStation.

2946
02:49:43,190 --> 02:49:43,810
My goodness.

2947
02:49:46,250 --> 02:49:47,750
It's a Dreamworks game?

2948
02:49:51,470 --> 02:49:52,270
Small soldiers.

2949
02:49:53,690 --> 02:49:54,930
Oh my gosh.

2950
02:49:55,710 --> 02:49:57,050
My other... Oh my god.

2951
02:49:59,070 --> 02:50:00,190
My other...

2952
02:50:00,190 --> 02:50:05,190
Small soldiers anecdote is that my local theater had 15 foot statues of the two main characters.

2953
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:07,930
Doesn't that defeat the purpose?

2954
02:50:08,050 --> 02:50:09,830
Aren't they supposed to be small soldiers?

2955
02:50:10,750 --> 02:50:12,550
Why are they 15 feet?

2956
02:50:14,670 --> 02:50:15,670
Oh my god.

2957
02:50:15,790 --> 02:50:16,850
Why does it... Pargon.

2958
02:50:17,070 --> 02:50:17,550
Pargon.

2959
02:50:17,950 --> 02:50:18,430
Pargon.

2960
02:50:18,930 --> 02:50:21,990
It looks like... It looks like Pargon!

2961
02:50:40,050 --> 02:50:41,490
Semi-dark movie.

2962
02:50:42,610 --> 02:50:43,190
What?

2963
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:46,910
Oh, there is a password.

2964
02:50:48,810 --> 02:50:50,470
This is not what I expected.

2965
02:50:50,970 --> 02:50:52,550
I expected more...

2966
02:50:53,210 --> 02:50:54,310
Just military.

2967
02:50:56,090 --> 02:50:56,670
Antorok.

2968
02:50:56,750 --> 02:50:57,150
Pargon.

2969
02:50:57,370 --> 02:50:57,950
Mantorok.

2970
02:50:58,150 --> 02:50:58,610
Pargon.

2971
02:50:58,730 --> 02:50:59,130
Pargon.

2972
02:50:59,290 --> 02:50:59,990
Red Gormor.

2973
02:51:00,130 --> 02:51:00,590
Pargon.

2974
02:51:06,470 --> 02:51:07,870
Let's try one player.

2975
02:51:08,050 --> 02:51:09,390
It's just me, myself and I.

2976
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:11,950
This is literally the MGS's Toy Story.

2977
02:51:11,950 --> 02:51:12,610
What?

2978
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:17,150
The commandos are mining Gorgon-ty ore.

2979
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:20,930
The creepy caverns obliterate their infernal mining machine.

2980
02:51:21,070 --> 02:51:23,130
Neutralize turrets and flying sentry horde.

2981
02:51:23,530 --> 02:51:27,110
Whoop chip for access card to lower force fields.

2982
02:51:27,250 --> 02:51:29,550
Use slam fist to smash all marauders.

2983
02:51:30,010 --> 02:51:34,030
Oh, thank you.

2984
02:51:34,450 --> 02:51:38,090
I like how... Square is fire.

2985
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:40,770
Select special ally.

2986
02:51:40,970 --> 02:51:42,070
Deploy special ally.

2987
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:42,630
Jump.

2988
02:51:43,390 --> 02:51:44,330
Sniper mode?

2989
02:51:49,890 --> 02:51:52,690
Why does this feel like Eternal Darkness?

2990
02:51:57,790 --> 02:51:58,450
Oh,

2991
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:02,880
I'm strapped.

2992
02:52:06,670 --> 02:52:07,990
Wait, what the hell?

2993
02:52:08,110 --> 02:52:08,950
I am so small.

2994
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,370
I'm a small soldier.

2995
02:52:13,150 --> 02:52:14,050
Do I have ammo?

2996
02:52:14,190 --> 02:52:14,810
I guess not.

2997
02:52:16,550 --> 02:52:17,490
Oh god!

2998
02:52:17,650 --> 02:52:18,290
Oh my god!

2999
02:52:18,410 --> 02:52:18,970
Oh my god!

3000
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:19,530
Strafe!

3001
02:52:19,610 --> 02:52:19,850
Strafe!

3002
02:52:19,970 --> 02:52:20,350
Strafe!

3003
02:52:28,030 --> 02:52:29,550
Is he following me?

3004
02:52:29,650 --> 02:52:29,950
Yes.

3005
02:52:49,070 --> 02:52:51,290
Strafe is the way.

3006
02:52:55,650 --> 02:52:57,570
I'm terrified of this game right now.

3007
02:53:00,010 --> 02:53:02,410
I'm actually scared of this game right now.

3008
02:53:04,050 --> 02:53:04,990
Am I OK?

3009
02:53:05,590 --> 02:53:06,650
I'm like meowing.

3010
02:53:16,630 --> 02:53:18,250
Are these bad guys?

3011
02:53:29,140 --> 02:53:30,600
I can also do that!

3012
02:53:36,730 --> 02:53:38,270
Avenge me comrade.

3013
02:53:38,390 --> 02:53:39,350
Oh my god, he exploded.

3014
02:53:43,370 --> 02:53:44,290
Wait, no!

3015
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:45,730
My special...

3016
02:53:47,710 --> 02:53:49,370
Avenge me comrade.

3017
02:53:51,070 --> 02:53:52,830
This is insanity.

3018
02:53:54,190 --> 02:53:55,210
What's over there?

3019
02:53:55,570 --> 02:53:56,510
Do you think I can make it there?

3020
02:53:58,630 --> 02:54:00,530
Oh, this is the sniping one, right?

3021
02:54:02,930 --> 02:54:04,790
This is spooky.

3022
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:06,210
This is scary.

3023
02:54:07,230 --> 02:54:08,590
The ambiance is going hard.

3024
02:54:08,670 --> 02:54:09,450
I know, right?

3025
02:54:10,650 --> 02:54:11,650
Goodness gra...

3026
02:54:18,110 --> 02:54:20,830
I don't want to be a small soldier anymore.

3027
02:54:21,230 --> 02:54:22,890
I want to be a large soldier.

3028
02:54:24,150 --> 02:54:25,450
I don't like this.

3029
02:54:26,370 --> 02:54:29,810
And it said I can move with the analog stick, but I cannot.

3030
02:54:30,070 --> 02:54:31,490
I can only move with the D-pad.

3031
02:54:32,250 --> 02:54:34,630
It totally pointed to the analog stick though.

3032
02:54:37,190 --> 02:54:37,630
OK.

3033
02:54:37,630 --> 02:54:38,430
Strafe, strafe.

3034
02:54:39,150 --> 02:54:39,790
OK, hold on.

3035
02:54:39,910 --> 02:54:41,070
I'm going to bring out my army.

3036
02:54:43,270 --> 02:54:44,130
Deploy army.

3037
02:54:46,590 --> 02:54:47,690
Nevermind, that didn't do anything.

3038
02:54:50,150 --> 02:54:52,050
Oh, the analog is not on.

3039
02:54:52,130 --> 02:54:52,490
You're right.

3040
02:54:53,190 --> 02:54:53,730
Oh, there we go.

3041
02:54:54,050 --> 02:54:54,650
Thank you.

3042
02:54:54,770 --> 02:54:55,270
Oh my gosh.

3043
02:54:55,550 --> 02:54:56,910
He's moving on his own!

3044
02:54:58,710 --> 02:54:59,510
What's happening?

3045
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:08,580
This was a bad idea.

3046
02:55:14,520 --> 02:55:15,740
I think I'm going to die here.

3047
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:17,680
I think I'm going to die here.

3048
02:55:17,980 --> 02:55:18,740
Oh, the framerate.

3049
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:20,720
Everything is happening.

3050
02:55:21,100 --> 02:55:21,940
Everything is happening.

3051
02:55:22,480 --> 02:55:22,880
Oh god.

3052
02:55:33,290 --> 02:55:34,290
There are so many things.

3053
02:55:34,630 --> 02:55:35,530
Why can't I aim?

3054
02:55:35,610 --> 02:55:36,570
Why can't it be like Doom?

3055
02:55:36,870 --> 02:55:38,050
Why can't you auto-aim?

3056
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:38,890
You idiot.

3057
02:55:39,150 --> 02:55:40,250
Oh my god, that guy is coming at me.

3058
02:55:46,510 --> 02:55:47,170
No, no, no.

3059
02:55:47,210 --> 02:55:47,590
Don't come here.

3060
02:55:48,270 --> 02:55:49,030
I'll get him first.

3061
02:55:49,170 --> 02:55:49,730
I'll get him first.

3062
02:55:52,670 --> 02:55:54,030
I'll kick his ass first.

3063
02:55:54,510 --> 02:55:55,490
I'll kick his ass first.

3064
02:56:00,830 --> 02:56:01,270
OK,

3065
02:56:07,070 --> 02:56:07,830
we're killing him.

3066
02:56:08,170 --> 02:56:08,850
We're killing him.

3067
02:56:09,430 --> 02:56:09,970
I'm strafing.

3068
02:56:10,030 --> 02:56:10,570
I'm strafing.

3069
02:56:11,850 --> 02:56:13,190
I'm playing the game.

3070
02:56:14,530 --> 02:56:15,650
I'm playing the game.

3071
02:56:16,290 --> 02:56:17,650
I don't know where the tur...

3072
02:56:17,650 --> 02:56:19,190
Avenge me, my comrades.

3073
02:56:20,650 --> 02:56:21,390
Oh my god.

3074
02:56:21,470 --> 02:56:22,710
Oh, this is secret.

3075
02:56:24,050 --> 02:56:26,970
I heard the code to unlock the secret video is actually...

3076
02:56:35,400 --> 02:56:36,860
What is shooting?

3077
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:46,600
If... OK, to give you an idea...

3078
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:51,180
OK, I think what's confusing me about it is I'm trying to control the camera.

3079
02:56:52,340 --> 02:56:55,660
But like the camera... So you control the camera and then you...

3080
02:56:56,220 --> 02:56:58,880
But sometimes I can't... I'm pressing forward.

3081
02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:02,260
I'm not moving forward, but I'm controlling the camera.

3082
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:05,880
But... So, I think maybe...

3083
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:10,280
Sometimes I turn...

3084
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:16,900
And then I have to turn and move and then turn and move forward and then turn and move forward and then turn and move forward.

3085
02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:20,580
That's how you have to play... That's how you have to move.

3086
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:27,160
Which is what makes it so... You can't... I guess unless you're running like this, but it's still just...

3087
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:27,960
Oh my god.

3088
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:30,560
Yeah, that's how I remember this game was.

3089
02:57:32,140 --> 02:57:33,440
What is shooting?

3090
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:35,780
What's here?

3091
02:57:37,720 --> 02:57:39,180
Oh, just kidding.

3092
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:41,000
Jump.

3093
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:41,900
Jump.

3094
02:57:43,340 --> 02:57:43,940
Jump.

3095
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:44,860
Oh, nevermind.

3096
02:57:44,980 --> 02:57:45,640
OK, nevermind.

3097
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:46,540
This area sucks.

3098
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:48,320
Can I jump here?

3099
02:57:49,900 --> 02:57:51,100
Oh god!

3100
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:52,180
Oh my god!

3101
02:57:52,600 --> 02:57:53,260
I ran away!

3102
02:57:54,580 --> 02:57:55,540
Tactical retreat?

3103
02:57:56,260 --> 02:57:57,940
What the hell is this game?

3104
02:58:01,400 --> 02:58:03,280
How am I supposed to defeat that?

3105
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:05,440
That's a whole ass turret!

3106
02:58:05,720 --> 02:58:06,300
OK, hold on.

3107
02:58:10,360 --> 02:58:11,760
Oh my god.

3108
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:15,100
Am I wasting this?

3109
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:16,680
I think I am.

3110
02:58:20,260 --> 02:58:21,080
There we go.

3111
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:21,620
Nice.

3112
02:58:23,640 --> 02:58:25,820
Why is everything barking in this game?

3113
02:58:29,260 --> 02:58:30,660
OK, we have the red key.

3114
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:32,220
I see there is something up there.

3115
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:33,500
I don't know what it is though.

3116
02:58:39,580 --> 02:58:40,020
Shit!

3117
02:58:40,740 --> 02:58:41,900
You're still alive!

3118
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:46,460
Nice.

3119
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:48,100
Oh my gosh, we killed it.

3120
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:51,180
But then there is also this guy over here too.

3121
02:58:54,040 --> 02:58:54,560
Oh my god!

3122
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:55,080
There is two of them!

3123
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:56,000
There is two of them!

3124
02:58:56,820 --> 02:58:57,460
Run away!

3125
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:00,700
OK, hold on.

3126
02:59:03,860 --> 02:59:04,940
OG aim assist.

3127
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:06,400
Oh gosh.

3128
02:59:08,180 --> 02:59:09,440
I don't think there is aim assist.

3129
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:12,120
I don't think there is really aim assist here.

3130
02:59:13,460 --> 02:59:14,160
Oh god.

3131
02:59:14,260 --> 02:59:15,260
I have to like turn?

3132
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:16,300
Oh my god.

3133
02:59:16,520 --> 02:59:17,080
OK, run.

3134
02:59:17,860 --> 02:59:18,760
Oh goodness.

3135
02:59:20,420 --> 02:59:20,800
Oh no.

3136
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:25,260
Oh god!

3137
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:28,140
I can't...

3138
02:59:29,540 --> 02:59:31,340
We are fighting for duty.

3139
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:33,260
I don't like this zone!

3140
02:59:33,820 --> 02:59:34,740
I hate you!

3141
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:41,300
We both died at the same time.

3142
02:59:42,280 --> 02:59:43,440
Avenge me comrades.

3143
02:59:43,820 --> 02:59:44,660
Where am I?

3144
02:59:45,100 --> 02:59:45,980
Did I kill him?

3145
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:48,760
No way.

3146
02:59:50,720 --> 02:59:51,520
Where is he?

3147
02:59:51,980 --> 02:59:53,100
Where is the thing he dropped?

3148
02:59:54,860 --> 02:59:55,880
Avenge me comrades.

3149
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:59,540
This is one of those games you really want to cheat code for.

3150
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:00,720
Absolutely.

3151
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:01,780
Oh my god.

3152
03:00:02,060 --> 03:00:02,460
Oh my god.

3153
03:00:02,600 --> 03:00:02,800
Please.

3154
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:03,360
Please.

3155
03:00:03,580 --> 03:00:03,780
Please.

3156
03:00:03,940 --> 03:00:04,160
Aim.

3157
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:04,580
Aim.

3158
03:00:04,740 --> 03:00:04,860
Aim.

3159
03:00:05,140 --> 03:00:05,340
Aim.

3160
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:05,840
Aim.

3161
03:00:06,140 --> 03:00:06,340
Aim.

3162
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:07,000
Aim.

3163
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:07,200
Aim.

3164
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:08,340
Aim.

3165
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:09,020
Aim.

3166
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:09,640
Aim.

3167
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:15,940
We are doing it!

3168
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:17,160
We are being a tiny soldier!

3169
03:00:18,060 --> 03:00:20,200
I don't like being a tiny soldier.

3170
03:00:20,360 --> 03:00:21,880
I want to be a big soldier now.

3171
03:00:31,400 --> 03:00:33,240
This is me being a tiny soldier.

3172
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:34,120
What are these?

3173
03:00:35,300 --> 03:00:39,360
I want to watch the movie now just so I understand what the hell is going on.

3174
03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:41,260
At least the enemies stay defeated.

3175
03:00:42,100 --> 03:00:44,900
Otherwise it would be absolute torture.

3176
03:00:45,880 --> 03:00:47,060
It would be so difficult.

3177
03:00:48,460 --> 03:00:49,020
OK.

3178
03:00:49,120 --> 03:00:49,700
Here we go.

3179
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:54,780
I hear him.

3180
03:00:55,340 --> 03:00:56,400
I hear him.

3181
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:04,420
Can whatever is shooting... Please.

3182
03:01:04,720 --> 03:01:05,280
Please.

3183
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:07,220
Just... Can you aim for it?

3184
03:01:07,260 --> 03:01:07,580
Please.

3185
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:09,920
Whatever you are aiming for just aim.

3186
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:12,980
I'm trying to run.

3187
03:01:13,300 --> 03:01:14,060
Oh my god.

3188
03:01:14,100 --> 03:01:14,900
There is three of them.

3189
03:01:18,780 --> 03:01:19,180
Yeah!

3190
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:20,360
Help me out buddy!

3191
03:01:21,200 --> 03:01:22,140
Help me out buddy!

3192
03:01:22,240 --> 03:01:23,180
Oh I think he is down.

3193
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:26,160
Avenge me comrade!

3194
03:01:28,120 --> 03:01:30,560
I can't move and fight at the same time.

3195
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:31,220
Go after him.

3196
03:01:31,280 --> 03:01:31,580
You know what?

3197
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:34,200
Go get him for me.

3198
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:34,640
Thank you.

3199
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:38,040
What the hell was that?

3200
03:01:40,580 --> 03:01:41,760
Was that my buddy?

3201
03:01:42,300 --> 03:01:42,860
Where did he go?

3202
03:01:43,340 --> 03:01:43,660
Buddy?

3203
03:01:46,500 --> 03:01:49,300
Is that my... Is that my buddy?

3204
03:01:50,960 --> 03:01:52,180
Oh that's my buddy.

3205
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:52,620
Hey buddy.

3206
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:54,440
Where are you going?

3207
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:55,160
Come on.

3208
03:01:55,220 --> 03:01:55,820
Let's keep going.

3209
03:01:56,640 --> 03:01:57,840
I'm going to die buddy.

3210
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:00,360
I ain't going to make it buddy.

3211
03:02:01,140 --> 03:02:03,820
Oh I got it.

3212
03:02:04,280 --> 03:02:07,260
For some reason jumping didn't want to grab it.

3213
03:02:07,360 --> 03:02:07,780
But that's OK.

3214
03:02:08,480 --> 03:02:09,720
I don't know what that did.

3215
03:02:10,880 --> 03:02:12,400
Maybe it's like capture the flag.

3216
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,240
This is a different version of the same disc I have.

3217
03:02:18,340 --> 03:02:20,280
Sorry for the one guy saga and yelling.

3218
03:02:20,400 --> 03:02:21,640
I was getting upset at myself.

3219
03:02:22,080 --> 03:02:22,540
It's OK.

3220
03:02:22,900 --> 03:02:23,760
I know you were trying.

3221
03:02:25,580 --> 03:02:28,160
I know you just wanted to share something with me.

3222
03:02:28,340 --> 03:02:28,900
It's all good.

3223
03:02:29,380 --> 03:02:30,280
I forgive you.

3224
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:34,220
Where do I go from here?

3225
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:38,160
Do I jump actually here?

3226
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:38,900
But like...

3227
03:02:41,300 --> 03:02:42,580
Buddy, but... No!

3228
03:02:46,620 --> 03:02:48,020
Don't prepare for duty.

3229
03:02:49,380 --> 03:02:50,460
Oh I can jump these.

3230
03:02:50,520 --> 03:02:51,160
OK, just kidding.

3231
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:54,360
No, my buddy can't though.

3232
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:56,140
My buddy can't jump these.

3233
03:02:57,960 --> 03:02:58,440
Buddy!

3234
03:03:06,740 --> 03:03:07,820
Is my buddy here?

3235
03:03:08,440 --> 03:03:09,100
I don't think so.

3236
03:03:10,100 --> 03:03:11,540
I don't think buddy is here guys.

3237
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:14,860
Rep buddy.

3238
03:03:15,640 --> 03:03:16,280
Oh my god.

3239
03:03:16,340 --> 03:03:17,900
Hey, let me up here first please.

3240
03:03:18,220 --> 03:03:18,900
Thank you.

3241
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:21,540
Let me at least get... Oh my god.

3242
03:03:21,860 --> 03:03:22,440
Please turn.

3243
03:03:22,820 --> 03:03:23,380
Turn the camera.

3244
03:03:23,640 --> 03:03:23,860
Run.

3245
03:03:24,380 --> 03:03:24,840
Do something.

3246
03:03:25,340 --> 03:03:25,560
Aim.

3247
03:03:26,060 --> 03:03:26,320
Aim.

3248
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:27,240
Just run.

3249
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:28,300
Shoot.

3250
03:03:28,820 --> 03:03:29,580
Do anything.

3251
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:30,220
Oh my god.

3252
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:31,440
Special!

3253
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:34,820
Oh good.

3254
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:35,600
I got that guy.

3255
03:03:36,180 --> 03:03:36,800
Yeah, yeah.

3256
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:37,420
Aim.

3257
03:03:37,640 --> 03:03:38,260
Nice, nice, nice.

3258
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:39,540
I think I'm...I think

3259
03:03:45,330 --> 03:03:46,710
I'm...I'm trying.

3260
03:03:47,430 --> 03:03:47,930
I'm trying.

3261
03:03:48,110 --> 03:03:48,950
There is health.

3262
03:04:03,620 --> 03:04:05,040
This game sucks.

3263
03:04:05,940 --> 03:04:07,740
This game is so hard.

3264
03:04:08,520 --> 03:04:10,280
Why is it like...

3265
03:04:12,580 --> 03:04:13,420
My buddy!

3266
03:04:15,620 --> 03:04:17,820
Alright, take care of him.

3267
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:22,220
Hey buddy, you are supposed to actually...

3268
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:23,400
Avenge me comrades.

3269
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:24,860
Yeah!

3270
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:33,860
How long is this demo?

3271
03:04:40,180 --> 03:04:41,220
There goes my buddy.

3272
03:04:41,320 --> 03:04:41,800
Buddy no!

3273
03:04:41,900 --> 03:04:42,620
You can't get him!

3274
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:43,820
Buddy no!

3275
03:04:43,900 --> 03:04:44,560
Don't be a hero!

3276
03:04:45,300 --> 03:04:45,800
Retreat!

3277
03:04:46,020 --> 03:04:46,780
Retreat buddy!

3278
03:04:47,080 --> 03:04:47,460
Retreat!

3279
03:04:56,360 --> 03:04:57,580
Who are you attacking?

3280
03:04:58,180 --> 03:04:58,800
Oh god.

3281
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:00,640
He is seeing phantoms.

3282
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:02,100
Buddy, you can't get them.

3283
03:05:02,200 --> 03:05:03,140
They are across the way buddy.

3284
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:04,380
We just gotta run for it.

3285
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:05,440
Run!

3286
03:05:07,400 --> 03:05:07,800
Run!

3287
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:08,340
Don't stop!

3288
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:10,700
Oh shit.

3289
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:11,180
Buddy!

3290
03:05:11,280 --> 03:05:12,500

3291
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:13,740

03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:15,420

3294
03:05:16,900 --> 03:05:17,400
Buddy, buddy.

3295
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:18,980
Buddy, buddy, where are you buddy?

3296
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:20,500
Buddy.

3297
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:21,980
Buddy, I need you.

3298
03:05:24,560 --> 03:05:26,960
OK, these are supposed to be homing, right?

3299
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:29,720
Buddy, what are you doing?

3300
03:05:29,800 --> 03:05:30,400
Where are you?

3301
03:05:31,260 --> 03:05:33,500
Buddy, this is the real battles here!

3302
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:35,860
Oh god, I'm gonna die.

3303
03:05:35,960 --> 03:05:37,980
Oh, nevermind.

3304
03:05:38,700 --> 03:05:41,320
I fell to the ground and I'm lost.

3305
03:05:42,700 --> 03:05:43,640
Where am I?

3306
03:05:49,780 --> 03:05:51,360
He is fighting his own demons.

3307
03:05:53,340 --> 03:05:54,860
You think he is still alive?

3308
03:06:01,320 --> 03:06:03,300
Guys, I don't think he is still alive.

3309
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:04,920
What the hell did I just throw?

3310
03:06:07,240 --> 03:06:10,160
I think...I think I just threw a grenade and I didn't mean to.

3311
03:06:11,960 --> 03:06:12,700
Turn around!

3312
03:06:14,980 --> 03:06:15,660
I'm done!

3313
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:17,020
I'm done with this one!

3314
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:17,880
I'm done!

3315
03:06:23,050 --> 03:06:23,850
Little soldiers.

3316
03:06:24,850 --> 03:06:26,830
Oh god, they are too little.

3317
03:06:27,010 --> 03:06:28,490
They don't have...they need to get bigger.

3318
03:06:29,050 --> 03:06:30,230
They need to eat their greens.

3319
03:06:31,610 --> 03:06:33,050
They need to eat their greens.

3320
03:06:33,570 --> 03:06:34,770
Oh my god.

3321
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:40,300
Oh, small soldiers.

3322
03:06:40,420 --> 03:06:40,720
My bad.

3323
03:06:42,140 --> 03:06:45,020
Guys, I think I'm good with this one.

3324
03:06:46,940 --> 03:06:48,980
I think I'm good with this...

3325
03:06:51,720 --> 03:06:52,160
thing.

3326
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:53,460
Hold on, give me one second.

3327
03:06:55,400 --> 03:06:55,840
Actually...

3328
03:06:55,840 --> 03:06:58,680
I have to switch my monitor real quick.

3329
03:07:20,790 --> 03:07:24,850
Watching small soldiers as a kid traumatized me about getting stuck in a sink garbage disposal.

3330
03:07:34,970 --> 03:07:36,730
I guess I can do Tomb Raider for a minute.

3331
03:07:37,370 --> 03:07:37,970
A little bit.

3332
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:41,660
I don't need controls.

3333
03:07:43,560 --> 03:07:47,560
I just want to get to the last two discs and make sure we have enough time for those two.

3334
03:07:48,220 --> 03:07:49,600
Sorry, I spent a lot of time on that one.

3335
03:07:52,620 --> 03:07:54,660
Yup, Tomb Raider 3!

3336
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:00,160
Ok, oh.

3337
03:08:01,800 --> 03:08:03,000
Why am I so stiff?

3338
03:08:04,320 --> 03:08:04,800
Hello?

3339
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:06,180
Ma'am, turn around.

3340
03:08:07,740 --> 03:08:09,240
I can't do this again.

3341
03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:11,280
It's tiny soldiers all over again you guys.

3342
03:08:11,560 --> 03:08:12,200
I can't do this.

3343
03:08:14,140 --> 03:08:14,620
Oopsie.

3344
03:08:31,150 --> 03:08:33,350
Maybe I should have looked at the controls.

3345
03:08:45,430 --> 03:08:47,430
I can't do this.

3346
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:51,710
I can't do this.

3347
03:09:28,960 --> 03:09:31,620
I was pressing every button.

3348
03:09:36,060 --> 03:09:37,540
That was roll.

3349
03:09:37,740 --> 03:09:38,580
What is action?

3350
03:09:38,860 --> 03:09:39,740
Ok, I was jumping.

3351
03:09:40,840 --> 03:09:41,620
Draw weapon.

3352
03:09:41,700 --> 03:09:43,080
I don't think I had any weapons.

3353
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:46,400
Ok, revengeance, revengeance, revengeance.

3354
03:09:50,570 --> 03:09:51,670
My stomach hurts.

3355
03:09:51,750 --> 03:09:53,770
It just threw me into the game.

3356
03:10:00,010 --> 03:10:02,590
She was just like, oh wait.

3357
03:10:03,330 --> 03:10:05,330
Ok, oh, we have to do that.

3358
03:10:05,610 --> 03:10:08,050
Oh god, the controls in this are really bad.

3359
03:10:09,250 --> 03:10:10,350
Can I analog?

3360
03:10:11,210 --> 03:10:12,170
Ok, I can.

3361
03:10:12,950 --> 03:10:14,670
But like, oh my god.

3362
03:10:15,170 --> 03:10:16,150
How did we do this?

3363
03:10:16,830 --> 03:10:18,570
You guys...

3364
03:10:20,710 --> 03:10:24,610
90's gamers are... I can't even move properly.

3365
03:10:24,610 --> 03:10:27,090
You guys, I just keep sidestepping.

3366
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:30,710
90's gamers are the strongest warriors, I swear to god.

3367
03:10:30,790 --> 03:10:32,810
This is impossible.

3368
03:10:34,370 --> 03:10:35,530
How do I move?

3369
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:44,420
Stop please.

3370
03:10:44,640 --> 03:10:45,920
Ok, I...

3371
03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:47,440
Use the D-pad.

3372
03:10:57,810 --> 03:10:58,550
Oh my god.

3373
03:11:00,310 --> 03:11:01,410
I think I just need to run.

3374
03:11:03,510 --> 03:11:04,270
Get up.

3375
03:11:05,230 --> 03:11:05,850
No, please.

3376
03:11:06,030 --> 03:11:06,710
Lara Croft.

3377
03:11:07,530 --> 03:11:09,790
Let's just admire how sexy she is.

3378
03:11:11,830 --> 03:11:14,990
She's got a really big forehead though.

3379
03:11:15,590 --> 03:11:16,350
Ok, Lara.

3380
03:11:16,750 --> 03:11:17,450
Here we go.

3381
03:11:18,810 --> 03:11:20,130
I'm just gonna run for it.

3382
03:11:20,270 --> 03:11:21,290
Alright, leave!

3383
03:11:21,710 --> 03:11:22,470
I can't see anything.

3384
03:11:22,790 --> 03:11:23,150
Oh my god.

3385
03:11:23,810 --> 03:11:24,610
Lara, run!

3386
03:11:25,230 --> 03:11:26,190
Not that way.

3387
03:11:26,430 --> 03:11:26,690
That way.

3388
03:11:27,030 --> 03:11:28,090
Lara, run.

3389
03:11:29,970 --> 03:11:31,270
Get out of here!

3390
03:11:31,650 --> 03:11:32,550
Oh my god, don't stop!

3391
03:11:37,710 --> 03:11:38,850
I can't see.

3392
03:11:41,750 --> 03:11:43,110
Oh yeah!

3393
03:11:43,790 --> 03:11:44,290
Give me those.

3394
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:52,470
Lara Croft, please.

3395
03:11:52,950 --> 03:11:53,790
Take the weapons.

3396
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:55,750
I pressed X!

3397
03:11:56,830 --> 03:11:58,870
I pressed...

3398
03:11:58,870 --> 03:11:59,510
X.

3399
03:12:00,810 --> 03:12:01,770
X.

3400
03:12:02,890 --> 03:12:03,930
X.

3401
03:12:05,070 --> 03:12:06,090
X.

3402
03:12:07,150 --> 03:12:08,070
X.

3403
03:12:08,730 --> 03:12:09,350
X.

3404
03:12:09,350 --> 03:12:09,410
X!

3405
03:12:11,450 --> 03:12:12,490
Oh, I got him.

3406
03:12:14,170 --> 03:12:15,330
How do I fire?

3407
03:12:17,570 --> 03:12:19,550
I think I also X.

3408
03:12:24,450 --> 03:12:27,070
I'm fighting for my afterlife in here, you guys.

3409
03:12:46,520 --> 03:12:48,080
Never stood a chance.

3410
03:12:49,660 --> 03:12:51,160
Oh my god, the controls.

3411
03:12:51,800 --> 03:12:52,700
The controls.

3412
03:12:53,280 --> 03:12:56,580
How do we have Metal Gear Solid and then whatever the hell... Oh, the wrong way.

3413
03:12:57,040 --> 03:12:58,800
Then whatever the hell these games have been.

3414
03:12:59,300 --> 03:13:00,560
I swear to god.

3415
03:13:01,320 --> 03:13:02,020
I swear!

3416
03:13:08,790 --> 03:13:10,110
Maybe that red button?

3417
03:13:11,390 --> 03:13:12,190
Oh god.

3418
03:13:13,510 --> 03:13:13,990
Here?

3419
03:13:15,030 --> 03:13:16,050
Oh, sorry.

3420
03:13:16,470 --> 03:13:17,170
Put my guns away.

3421
03:13:18,430 --> 03:13:20,050
My guns are still out though.

3422
03:13:21,950 --> 03:13:23,110
Maybe here.

3423
03:13:24,250 --> 03:13:25,050
Ok.

3424
03:13:25,670 --> 03:13:26,710
Oh my god.

3425
03:13:27,650 --> 03:13:29,170
I played Tomb Raider.

3426
03:13:29,990 --> 03:13:30,750
Before.

3427
03:13:34,450 --> 03:13:35,250
Well...

3428
03:13:35,250 --> 03:13:37,070
Because my dad liked Tomb Raider.

3429
03:13:40,430 --> 03:13:41,790
Ok, not that.

3430
03:13:43,870 --> 03:13:46,470
Someone actually saying MGS1 has good controls.

3431
03:13:46,610 --> 03:13:48,450
Comparatively speaking...

3432
03:13:48,450 --> 03:13:49,250
Yeah.

3433
03:13:50,990 --> 03:13:56,950
Comparatively speaking, Metal Gear has amazing controls compared to every game we've played today.

3434
03:14:00,990 --> 03:14:01,630
Roblox.

3435
03:14:02,410 --> 03:14:03,430
Roblox oof.

3436
03:14:07,050 --> 03:14:07,270
Oh.

3437
03:14:08,050 --> 03:14:08,810
It just locks.

3438
03:14:13,570 --> 03:14:14,850
I think...

3439
03:14:14,850 --> 03:14:17,370
I think this is the end of the demo.

3440
03:14:17,370 --> 03:14:19,350
What the hell am I supposed to do?

3441
03:14:20,990 --> 03:14:22,490
Maybe we go back.

3442
03:14:32,230 --> 03:14:33,830
Got my guns out.

3443
03:14:35,670 --> 03:14:35,950
Hello?

3444
03:14:36,350 --> 03:14:37,490
Who's coming for me?

3445
03:14:38,510 --> 03:14:41,310
You're gonna meet Ebony and Ivory.

3446
03:14:43,210 --> 03:14:45,250
One single guy works at this place?

3447
03:14:48,090 --> 03:14:50,090
Do I do anything with him?

3448
03:14:50,830 --> 03:14:51,690
Hey buddy.

3449
03:14:53,410 --> 03:14:55,170
Hey, you got something for me?

3450
03:14:55,890 --> 03:15:00,270
People really understand how much Mario 64 did for controls in 3D games.

3451
03:15:01,610 --> 03:15:02,630
They're out of budget.

3452
03:15:05,290 --> 03:15:06,450
T-bag him?

3453
03:15:20,490 --> 03:15:21,530
Oh yeah.

3454
03:15:22,750 --> 03:15:23,730
Button on the wall?

3455
03:15:23,830 --> 03:15:24,930
I tried pressing it.

3456
03:15:25,010 --> 03:15:26,130
This one right here, right?

3457
03:15:28,490 --> 03:15:29,410
OK, thank you.

3458
03:15:30,070 --> 03:15:30,950
That's annoying.

3459
03:15:33,270 --> 03:15:34,430
Action button, right?

3460
03:15:38,310 --> 03:15:38,830
Maybe...

3461
03:15:38,830 --> 03:15:40,470
Maybe...let me try square.

3462
03:15:41,050 --> 03:15:42,270
You have to be precise.

3463
03:15:44,890 --> 03:15:47,090
How...how much more...

3464
03:15:47,790 --> 03:15:50,470
I can only get so close to it.

3465
03:15:56,080 --> 03:15:57,360
Hold L1.

3466
03:16:01,660 --> 03:16:02,940
Or R2.

3467
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:05,900
Nope, those are not the controls.

3468
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:08,660
L1 is looking around.

3469
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:14,520
Press the button, Lord!

3470
03:16:14,660 --> 03:16:15,560
Oh, thank god.

3471
03:16:21,270 --> 03:16:21,710
Yes.

3472
03:16:22,630 --> 03:16:24,270
I love a...oh, OK.

3473
03:16:24,650 --> 03:16:25,930
How do I duck now?

3474
03:16:25,930 --> 03:16:27,490
Oh my goodness.

3475
03:16:28,530 --> 03:16:30,810
I thought I could roll into it.

3476
03:16:36,130 --> 03:16:36,730
Please.

3477
03:16:36,730 --> 03:16:37,330
R2?

3478
03:16:38,110 --> 03:16:38,650
Oh, thank you.

3479
03:16:38,970 --> 03:16:39,070
OK.

3480
03:16:42,710 --> 03:16:45,170
Oh my god, maybe this is Metal Gear Solid.

3481
03:16:46,850 --> 03:16:47,970
Look how hot she is.

3482
03:16:51,400 --> 03:16:52,960
I can't see anything.

3483
03:16:54,500 --> 03:16:55,020
Please.

3484
03:16:56,120 --> 03:16:59,600
Grab onto the ledge, Lara Croft!

3485
03:16:59,960 --> 03:17:00,540
Thank you.

3486
03:17:04,660 --> 03:17:05,840
Oh my god.

3487
03:17:07,040 --> 03:17:07,600
Oh god.

3488
03:17:11,040 --> 03:17:13,620
You can't...oof, that's my line.

3489
03:17:16,560 --> 03:17:17,360
OK.

3490
03:17:18,380 --> 03:17:19,180
We got that.

3491
03:17:20,760 --> 03:17:23,440
Stop backing...jumping back, please!

3492
03:17:27,740 --> 03:17:29,320
Even the way she climbs is sexy.

3493
03:17:29,460 --> 03:17:31,720
Maybe that's why they want you to do it so many times.

3494
03:17:32,620 --> 03:17:34,240
Really get your money's worth, I guess.

3495
03:17:34,980 --> 03:17:35,800
What is that?

3496
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:36,840
No, no, stop.

3497
03:17:37,280 --> 03:17:38,500
I'm just trying to turn.

3498
03:17:39,340 --> 03:17:40,640
I'm just trying to turn.

3499
03:17:46,360 --> 03:17:48,220
Oh no, if I press back...OK.

3500
03:17:49,640 --> 03:17:50,220
No, no.

3501
03:17:50,700 --> 03:17:50,960
Back.

3502
03:17:51,100 --> 03:17:51,820
OK, now you can back.

3503
03:17:52,120 --> 03:17:52,940
Back it up, baby.

3504
03:17:53,320 --> 03:17:53,900
There we go.

3505
03:17:54,900 --> 03:17:55,860
OK, more health.

3506
03:17:56,940 --> 03:17:59,020
Oh gosh, why am I even grabbing all this stuff?

3507
03:17:59,040 --> 03:17:59,660
What's the point?

3508
03:18:01,400 --> 03:18:02,480
What's the point?

3509
03:18:07,700 --> 03:18:09,520
This is so...

3510
03:18:11,640 --> 03:18:13,660
I have to be so delicate.

3511
03:18:14,180 --> 03:18:15,200
OK girl, yeah.

3512
03:18:15,660 --> 03:18:16,140
That's right.

3513
03:18:17,180 --> 03:18:18,320
What is this thing anyway?

3514
03:18:20,140 --> 03:18:21,260
Do I have an inventory?

3515
03:18:21,480 --> 03:18:22,140
Oh, no.

3516
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:24,120
Pause.

3517
03:18:25,020 --> 03:18:25,360
OK.

3518
03:18:27,300 --> 03:18:29,520
Please, run, turn.

3519
03:18:30,400 --> 03:18:32,680
I have to do that like run and turn thing.

3520
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:36,600
This is why I never played Tomb Raider.

3521
03:18:36,760 --> 03:18:38,800
I don't blame you.

3522
03:18:41,340 --> 03:18:43,580
Why is it so quiet?

3523
03:18:44,500 --> 03:18:45,120
Oh my god.

3524
03:18:47,520 --> 03:18:49,180
Run Lara Croft, run!

3525
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:50,280
We're not gonna make it.

3526
03:18:50,900 --> 03:18:51,460
Oh, nevermind.

3527
03:18:55,140 --> 03:18:55,740
Ouch.

3528
03:18:57,800 --> 03:18:58,160
Back!

3529
03:19:09,420 --> 03:19:11,180
Good job everybody.

3530
03:19:12,740 --> 03:19:14,440
Why is it so quiet?

3531
03:19:17,240 --> 03:19:18,160
That was a ladder?

3532
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:23,240
The first dodge was very cool.

3533
03:19:23,340 --> 03:19:23,860
Thank you.

3534
03:19:29,510 --> 03:19:32,350
Gosh, these games are making me tired.

3535
03:19:34,990 --> 03:19:37,630
Let's do the next disc now.

3536
03:19:37,710 --> 03:19:38,550
Are we good to go?

3537
03:19:41,530 --> 03:19:43,490
This one just frustrated me.

3538
03:19:45,550 --> 03:19:48,390
We didn't need Rage Games back in the day.

3539
03:19:51,570 --> 03:19:55,430
Next one is... Let's go with... What's the date on this?

3540
03:19:56,050 --> 03:19:57,110
This one is 2003.

3541
03:19:57,270 --> 03:19:59,010
This one I have no idea what's on it.

3542
03:20:07,180 --> 03:20:08,340
We shall see.

3543
03:20:12,310 --> 03:20:14,750
We shall see what is on it.

3544
03:20:14,790 --> 03:20:17,130
Then the last one we have is the Holiday 2004.

3545
03:20:20,990 --> 03:20:24,230
This one is... Now we're into the PlayStation 2 discs.

3546
03:20:26,530 --> 03:20:29,990
So yeah, we're full on PS2 era baby.

3547
03:20:37,910 --> 03:20:40,050
The memories, right?

3548
03:20:40,630 --> 03:20:42,390
I need some more water after this though.

3549
03:20:43,290 --> 03:20:49,310
The video game demos contained on this DVD are early versions that have not completed the SCEA testing cycle.

3550
03:20:51,630 --> 03:20:54,390
EA Games, challenge everything.

3551
03:20:54,490 --> 03:20:57,390
What the...

3552
03:20:59,810 --> 03:21:02,490
EA Games, challenge everything.

3553
03:21:05,030 --> 03:21:07,550
What is this?

3554
03:21:13,330 --> 03:21:14,610
Oh, 007!

3555
03:21:21,450 --> 03:21:22,090
This

3556
03:21:33,820 --> 03:21:37,120
is the guy that was grabbing the Indiana Jones stuff earlier.

3557
03:21:38,360 --> 03:21:39,440
In his little tux.

3558
03:21:41,840 --> 03:21:42,480
Bond.

3559
03:21:42,900 --> 03:21:44,180
James Bond.

3560
03:21:47,220 --> 03:21:47,860
I

3561
03:21:51,150 --> 03:21:53,290
have no idea what's gonna be on this disc.

3562
03:21:53,290 --> 03:21:55,350
This is from... Oh, I should have looked at it.

3563
03:21:55,390 --> 03:21:59,430
It's from the PlayStation Magazine issue 76.

3564
03:22:03,150 --> 03:22:04,710
Wow, sexy lady.

3565
03:22:05,410 --> 03:22:08,550
Why is it... His eyes are so freaky though.

3566
03:22:09,150 --> 03:22:10,170
Best Bond game ever.

3567
03:22:11,590 --> 03:22:14,250
Don't a lot of people like the one from the Nintendo though?

3568
03:22:14,830 --> 03:22:17,450
I never had a 64 so I don't know.

3569
03:22:23,800 --> 03:22:25,060
Is that Dragon Ball?

3570
03:22:25,060 --> 03:22:26,120
Wait.

3571
03:22:29,770 --> 03:22:31,370
Ape Escape 2!

3572
03:22:31,970 --> 03:22:34,550
And Dragon Ball Z Budokai!

3573
03:22:36,350 --> 03:22:38,050
No way, Ape Escape.

3574
03:22:38,910 --> 03:22:39,750
Oh my gosh!

3575
03:22:40,130 --> 03:22:41,910
Wait, we have to try the Ape Escape!

3576
03:22:42,550 --> 03:22:43,390
Wait, download.

3577
03:22:44,610 --> 03:22:45,590
100% complete.

3578
03:22:46,610 --> 03:22:48,390
All items in travel station except...

3579
03:22:50,170 --> 03:22:52,570
Is this a demo or is it...

3580
03:22:53,770 --> 03:22:55,070
I can't tell.

3581
03:22:57,390 --> 03:22:58,530
I think these are saves.

3582
03:22:59,230 --> 03:22:59,610
No!

3583
03:23:00,750 --> 03:23:03,170
I don't think these are actual games.

3584
03:23:06,630 --> 03:23:07,270
No!

3585
03:23:07,790 --> 03:23:09,210
That's so sad.

3586
03:23:15,730 --> 03:23:18,370
The 2 that I actually wanna do.

3587
03:23:20,490 --> 03:23:21,610
That's so sad.

3588
03:23:21,690 --> 03:23:22,230
Let's see what we have.

3589
03:23:22,270 --> 03:23:23,470
We have Sokong 2.

3590
03:23:24,710 --> 03:23:27,070
We have Rise of Honor.

3591
03:23:27,070 --> 03:23:28,670
Oh sorry, Rise 2 Honor.

3592
03:23:29,410 --> 03:23:31,210
Oh my gosh, Desert Storm 2!

3593
03:23:32,870 --> 03:23:35,530
Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure.

3594
03:23:36,630 --> 03:23:38,710

03:23:40,610 --> 03:23:41,850
Freedom Fighters.

3596
03:23:43,910 --> 03:23:45,810
Jimmy Neutron!

3597
03:23:47,330 --> 03:23:48,990
Madden 2004.

3598
03:23:50,430 --> 03:23:52,330
NCAA Football 2004.

3599
03:23:52,330 --> 03:23:56,930
R-Type Finals?

3600
03:23:58,930 --> 03:24:00,710
And Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

3601
03:24:01,090 --> 03:24:02,770
Oh sorry, Whiplash.

3602
03:24:07,240 --> 03:24:08,220
007.

3603
03:24:09,300 --> 03:24:10,700
Oh wow, there's actually so much.

3604
03:24:15,580 --> 03:24:16,560
TMNT?

3605
03:24:17,080 --> 03:24:17,940
Let's do TMNT.

3606
03:24:25,030 --> 03:24:26,650
I don't need controls.

3607
03:24:31,910 --> 03:24:33,130
I don't need controls.

3608
03:24:33,210 --> 03:24:35,250
Oh my gosh, what if they say Cowabunga you guys?

3609
03:24:36,030 --> 03:24:37,930
What if they say Cowabunga?

3610
03:24:41,310 --> 03:24:44,530
I don't need controls.

3611
03:24:56,010 --> 03:24:56,570
Konami?

3612
03:24:57,290 --> 03:24:58,510
It's a Konami game?

3613
03:25:10,030 --> 03:25:10,430
Yeah!

3614
03:25:12,070 --> 03:25:13,570
Oh I get to choose.

3615
03:25:14,830 --> 03:25:16,490
I can be...

3616
03:25:16,490 --> 03:25:17,390
Donatello!

3617
03:25:18,730 --> 03:25:19,530
Michelangelo!

3618
03:25:20,610 --> 03:25:21,410
Leonardo!

3619
03:25:22,990 --> 03:25:23,790
Raphael!

3620
03:25:26,350 --> 03:25:27,150
Donatello...

3621
03:25:28,390 --> 03:25:29,710
Who should I be?

3622
03:25:38,660 --> 03:25:39,460
Mikey?

3623
03:25:41,940 --> 03:25:44,520
Oh, I can only be Leonardo.

3624
03:25:44,680 --> 03:25:45,060
Just kidding.

3625
03:25:46,720 --> 03:25:48,280
I can only be Leonardo.

3626
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:49,700
Are you sure?

3627
03:25:49,840 --> 03:25:51,180
You give me no other choice.

3628
03:25:52,280 --> 03:25:54,100
Don't give me the illusion of choice.

3629
03:25:59,850 --> 03:26:01,290
Turtles, count it off.

3630
03:26:01,370 --> 03:26:01,790
Turtles!

3631
03:26:06,670 --> 03:26:07,790
Area 2.

3632
03:26:08,450 --> 03:26:10,030
Wow, they're just throwing us in, huh?

3633
03:26:11,090 --> 03:26:12,110
Pizza shop.

3634
03:26:13,870 --> 03:26:14,530
Ah!

3635
03:26:20,140 --> 03:26:22,220
Is this Metal Gear Rising?

3636
03:26:25,260 --> 03:26:25,920
Yeah,

3637
03:26:29,080 --> 03:26:29,980
I'm a heavy turtle.

3638
03:26:30,080 --> 03:26:31,120
I can't jump very high.

3639
03:26:32,620 --> 03:26:33,820
Come here, guys!

3640
03:26:37,940 --> 03:26:38,600
Slice

3641
03:26:42,750 --> 03:26:43,310
and dice!

3642
03:26:46,650 --> 03:26:48,410
Oh my god!

3643
03:26:50,610 --> 03:26:51,830
Slice and dice!

3644
03:26:56,150 --> 03:26:57,810
I'm killing it, you guys.

3645
03:27:00,910 --> 03:27:02,070
Slice and dice!

3646
03:27:02,390 --> 03:27:03,350
Oh shoot, nevermind.

3647
03:27:03,570 --> 03:27:04,130
They're killing me.

3648
03:27:05,310 --> 03:27:06,710
I dodged that though.

3649
03:27:06,830 --> 03:27:07,170
Oh shoot.

3650
03:27:07,650 --> 03:27:08,150
Run away!

3651
03:27:11,030 --> 03:27:13,290
How do I...

3652
03:27:15,530 --> 03:27:16,930
Hey, come back here.

3653
03:27:17,390 --> 03:27:18,450
Come back here, buddy.

3654
03:27:23,630 --> 03:27:24,690
I'm going, I'm going.

3655
03:27:24,790 --> 03:27:25,210
Oh my god.

3656
03:27:29,450 --> 03:27:32,410
Oh, nevermind.

3657
03:27:32,730 --> 03:27:33,130
Nevermind.

3658
03:27:35,010 --> 03:27:35,790
Slice and dice!

3659
03:27:36,690 --> 03:27:37,850
Slice and dice!

3660
03:27:38,050 --> 03:27:39,110
Slice and dice!

3661
03:27:39,990 --> 03:27:40,750
Oh my god!

3662
03:27:41,750 --> 03:27:43,510
I'm amazing!

3663
03:27:44,310 --> 03:27:46,750
That was the...

3664
03:27:47,270 --> 03:27:49,050
Don't look at that.

3665
03:27:56,330 --> 03:27:58,750
Don't avoid me!

3666
03:28:00,350 --> 03:28:01,750
Don't dodge me!

3667
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:04,730
Go!

3668
03:28:06,050 --> 03:28:08,210
Is there like no items or anything?

3669
03:28:08,470 --> 03:28:09,790
I just keep running and...

3670
03:28:10,630 --> 03:28:11,730
I keep running and...

3671
03:28:11,730 --> 03:28:14,290
What the hell are these?

3672
03:28:15,710 --> 03:28:16,930
Oh gosh, there's a real person.

3673
03:28:17,830 --> 03:28:23,670
I think there's a real big difference between killing humans and then killing little robot bunnies.

3674
03:28:23,870 --> 03:28:24,430
You know what I'm saying?

3675
03:28:24,810 --> 03:28:25,790
It's kind of crazy.

3676
03:28:26,090 --> 03:28:26,630
Stay down!

3677
03:28:27,150 --> 03:28:27,950
Slice and dice!

3678
03:28:28,070 --> 03:28:28,830
Slice and dice!

3679
03:28:28,950 --> 03:28:29,730
Slice and dice!

3680
03:28:29,910 --> 03:28:30,730
Slice and dice!

3681
03:28:32,550 --> 03:28:35,870
That is like the arcade style where you can't go any further.

3682
03:28:35,990 --> 03:28:39,170
You just like defeat all the enemies in a screen and...

3683
03:28:39,170 --> 03:28:42,370
Oh my god.

3684
03:28:42,810 --> 03:28:43,070
Oh my god.

3685
03:28:49,310 --> 03:28:51,930
One for you!

3686
03:28:57,010 --> 03:28:58,030
Slice and dice!

3687
03:28:58,950 --> 03:28:59,430
Slice...

3688
03:29:04,230 --> 03:29:05,990
They're like little dinosaurs.

3689
03:29:08,370 --> 03:29:09,570
Slice and dice!

3690
03:29:10,650 --> 03:29:12,910
Guys, I think he likes slicing and dicing.

3691
03:29:14,610 --> 03:29:16,550
I have an inkling.

3692
03:29:18,090 --> 03:29:18,830
Sushi!

3693
03:29:30,290 --> 03:29:31,430
Stay down.

3694
03:29:31,430 --> 03:29:33,830
I think he likes slicing and dicing.

3695
03:29:36,870 --> 03:29:38,430
Something is giving me...

3696
03:29:41,250 --> 03:29:42,350
Did that beat it?

3697
03:29:47,330 --> 03:29:48,110
Hey, hey.

3698
03:29:48,390 --> 03:29:49,390
Chill out, guys.

3699
03:29:54,470 --> 03:29:56,710
Oh, I'm out of... Oh, I'm out of the shuriken.

3700
03:30:01,430 --> 03:30:03,190
Slice and dice!

3701
03:30:03,390 --> 03:30:04,270
Slice and dice!

3702
03:30:07,950 --> 03:30:09,530
What the hell was that?

3703
03:30:13,470 --> 03:30:15,830
Yeah, we had some sort of...

3704
03:30:17,390 --> 03:30:18,530
Oh nice, more.

3705
03:30:20,610 --> 03:30:21,570
What the hell?

3706
03:30:21,830 --> 03:30:23,570
Oh my god, they're all exploding so much.

3707
03:30:33,310 --> 03:30:35,630
I'm just mashing buttons, you guys.

3708
03:30:36,290 --> 03:30:39,630
I'm just... I'm becoming one with the turtle, you know?

3709
03:30:40,130 --> 03:30:41,430
One with the slicing.

3710
03:30:41,950 --> 03:30:43,450
I'm slicing, I'm dicing.

3711
03:30:43,990 --> 03:30:46,770
I don't feel like I...

3712
03:30:46,770 --> 03:30:47,950
This is my purpose.

3713
03:30:48,130 --> 03:30:49,370
It's to slice and dice.

3714
03:30:53,570 --> 03:30:55,350
I think that's how you play the game.

3715
03:30:55,970 --> 03:30:56,530
True.

3716
03:30:59,710 --> 03:31:02,450
He just whacks me on the head.

3717
03:31:08,310 --> 03:31:09,970
It's starting to get me good, though.

3718
03:31:13,730 --> 03:31:16,090
How do I reload my shuriken, I wonder?

3719
03:31:17,850 --> 03:31:18,710
What's this?

3720
03:31:19,590 --> 03:31:20,370
Oh, it's a fence-off.

3721
03:31:21,090 --> 03:31:22,090
What the...

3722
03:31:24,400 --> 03:31:24,810
Goodbye!

3723
03:31:27,970 --> 03:31:28,890
I think it's temporary.

3724
03:31:29,430 --> 03:31:30,290
That's kind of sad.

3725
03:31:33,350 --> 03:31:34,170
No!

3726
03:31:34,590 --> 03:31:37,030
My temporary defense...

3727
03:31:37,030 --> 03:31:37,670
Hello?

3728
03:31:41,250 --> 03:31:42,070
Pizza!

3729
03:31:44,400 --> 03:31:46,090
Not a single cowabunga.

3730
03:31:47,230 --> 03:31:50,590
Guys, this game might be the worst of all time.

3731
03:31:52,630 --> 03:31:54,050
This game might be terrible.

3732
03:31:54,630 --> 03:31:56,630
How am I getting hurt so badly?

3733
03:31:56,730 --> 03:31:58,150
They're hitting literally my shell.

3734
03:32:07,170 --> 03:32:09,290
Do you get a cowabunga at the end?

3735
03:32:09,430 --> 03:32:10,810
Okay, I'm trusting you guys.

3736
03:32:10,890 --> 03:32:11,710
I'm trusting you guys.

3737
03:32:16,510 --> 03:32:17,350
Oh, shoot.

3738
03:32:18,310 --> 03:32:18,870
They got me good.

3739
03:32:21,070 --> 03:32:22,250
Stop getting me!

3740
03:32:23,030 --> 03:32:24,270
Stop hitting my head!

3741
03:32:47,840 --> 03:32:49,240
Okay, I hear you.

3742
03:32:49,300 --> 03:32:49,960
I hear you.

3743
03:32:50,020 --> 03:32:50,380
I'm going.

3744
03:32:50,560 --> 03:32:50,880
I'm going!

3745
03:32:53,440 --> 03:32:54,180
Oh my god.

3746
03:32:54,300 --> 03:32:55,800
He just came in swinging.

3747
03:32:55,940 --> 03:32:56,660
That's my job!

3748
03:32:57,920 --> 03:33:00,640
Guys, I don't even know how to... How am I supposed to commentate on this?

3749
03:33:01,320 --> 03:33:07,440
She's playing the classic space slash, slice and dice combo.

3750
03:33:08,520 --> 03:33:16,060
Only real TMNT people are doing that combo.

3751
03:33:16,500 --> 03:33:17,820
Truly, it's a master.

3752
03:33:17,940 --> 03:33:19,240
She's a master of the craft.

3753
03:33:19,900 --> 03:33:20,560
She's slicing.

3754
03:33:20,800 --> 03:33:21,420
She's dicing.

3755
03:33:21,780 --> 03:33:22,920
Everything is exploding.

3756
03:33:23,480 --> 03:33:24,940
All she wants is a piece of pizza.

3757
03:33:30,640 --> 03:33:31,500
Slice and dice.

3758
03:33:34,620 --> 03:33:35,380
We're going!

3759
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:36,560
How long is this demo?

3760
03:33:38,040 --> 03:33:39,080
Slice and dice.

3761
03:33:39,880 --> 03:33:41,360
Slice... Slice and dice.

3762
03:33:42,160 --> 03:33:43,660
I'm gonna kill this guy first.

3763
03:33:44,640 --> 03:33:45,560
I'm focusing on you.

3764
03:33:46,120 --> 03:33:47,260
You are my... Oh.

3765
03:33:47,980 --> 03:33:48,400
There we go.

3766
03:33:50,260 --> 03:33:51,640
I think it's Sony.

3767
03:33:54,800 --> 03:33:56,020
Oh my god, so cute!

3768
03:33:56,800 --> 03:33:57,900
Oh, did I just slip?

3769
03:33:57,900 --> 03:33:58,400
I'm sorry for her.

3770
03:33:59,920 --> 03:34:01,400
Did I slip on the water?

3771
03:34:03,880 --> 03:34:04,480
Get up!

3772
03:34:18,230 --> 03:34:20,090
Yeah, the car explodes.

3773
03:34:20,210 --> 03:34:21,630
The barrels explode.

3774
03:34:25,310 --> 03:34:25,850
Nice.

3775
03:34:28,130 --> 03:34:30,510
I don't remember which one was the strong attack.

3776
03:34:30,670 --> 03:34:33,250
If X was the strong attack and...

3777
03:34:34,230 --> 03:34:35,790
Square is my weak attack.

3778
03:34:35,910 --> 03:34:36,650
I can't remember.

3779
03:34:37,170 --> 03:34:40,330
Hey, I'm supposed to have a stronger attack, right?

3780
03:34:41,350 --> 03:34:41,810
Nice.

3781
03:34:46,190 --> 03:34:47,670
He says a full heal?

3782
03:34:47,910 --> 03:34:48,150
Damn.

3783
03:34:49,190 --> 03:34:50,510
It's ok, we don't need control.

3784
03:34:50,630 --> 03:34:51,010
So true!

3785
03:34:51,490 --> 03:34:55,650
I got more shooting gun, but it says that I have zero, so I don't know what's going on.

3786
03:34:56,590 --> 03:34:58,850
Oh, I'm at the limit of the...

3787
03:35:00,370 --> 03:35:01,330
Slice and dice.

3788
03:35:01,450 --> 03:35:02,350
Slice and dice.

3789
03:35:02,530 --> 03:35:03,430
Slice and dice.

3790
03:35:03,650 --> 03:35:04,510
Slice and dice.

3791
03:35:04,810 --> 03:35:05,470
Slice and dice.

3792
03:35:05,590 --> 03:35:06,550
Slice and dice.

3793
03:35:06,550 --> 03:35:07,690
Slice and dice.

3794
03:35:08,410 --> 03:35:09,650
I'm just like him.

3795
03:35:11,150 --> 03:35:12,310
Slice and dice.

3796
03:35:12,670 --> 03:35:13,330
Oh, damn.

3797
03:35:16,690 --> 03:35:17,590
Goodbye.

3798
03:35:18,890 --> 03:35:20,030
Slice and dice.

3799
03:35:24,330 --> 03:35:25,230
Bonus.

3800
03:35:27,810 --> 03:35:29,530
Max combo 14?

3801
03:35:29,930 --> 03:35:30,190
Ok.

3802
03:35:30,830 --> 03:35:31,170
Alright.

3803
03:35:32,710 --> 03:35:33,550
New record?

3804
03:35:41,510 --> 03:35:43,210
They didn't say it.

3805
03:35:46,670 --> 03:35:48,570
They didn't say it.

3806
03:35:50,630 --> 03:35:50,910
Oh.

3807
03:35:51,470 --> 03:35:53,790
Tell everyone that you know more than they do.

3808
03:36:17,450 --> 03:36:19,570
I can't believe there is no Cowabunga.

3809
03:36:21,270 --> 03:36:24,010
Guys, I'm not really feeling any of these other games.

3810
03:36:24,130 --> 03:36:24,630
I don't know.

3811
03:36:26,570 --> 03:36:27,750
I don't know.

3812
03:36:27,930 --> 03:36:28,880
Maybe Disney Skate.

3813
03:36:28,880 --> 03:36:31,160
Yeah, I'll try it for a second.

3814
03:36:41,140 --> 03:36:42,880
Wacky Proto Cooking Mama.

3815
03:36:43,020 --> 03:36:44,440
Oh, that sounds fun.

3816
03:36:48,320 --> 03:36:51,820
I still have one more disc, by the way, so don't worry.

3817
03:36:54,780 --> 03:36:56,640
I know what you did.

3818
03:36:57,560 --> 03:36:59,860
I don't need the controllers.

3819
03:37:06,970 --> 03:37:08,470
Ten real kids?

3820
03:37:16,300 --> 03:37:18,980
Wait, this might be copyrighted, so hold on.

3821
03:37:19,060 --> 03:37:20,700
I'm just gonna turn that down.

3822
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:21,880
These kids.

3823
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:24,440
Oh my gosh.

3824
03:37:24,940 --> 03:37:26,320
I didn't know that... What?

3825
03:37:27,800 --> 03:37:29,100
Except I didn't skateboard.

3826
03:37:31,580 --> 03:37:33,720
I did inline skating.

3827
03:37:34,240 --> 03:37:35,720
So I wouldn't have been chosen.

3828
03:37:35,900 --> 03:37:36,960
That's so messed up.

3829
03:37:40,040 --> 03:37:41,600
I'm gonna keep turning it down.

3830
03:37:42,100 --> 03:37:43,880
Oh, they're liking that kid.

3831
03:37:44,080 --> 03:37:45,020
Oh, nevermind.

3832
03:37:47,060 --> 03:37:48,180
How embarrassing.

3833
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:51,040
You just completely...

3834
03:37:53,380 --> 03:37:57,520
The kid on the... Your tiny crotch, please.

3835
03:37:57,720 --> 03:37:58,240
Oh my god!

3836
03:37:58,640 --> 03:37:59,560
Is that the kids?

3837
03:38:01,640 --> 03:38:02,040
Wow!

3838
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:03,580
They're playing the game.

3839
03:38:03,680 --> 03:38:04,680
They're like, that's me, dad.

3840
03:38:04,760 --> 03:38:05,420
I'm in the game.

3841
03:38:07,200 --> 03:38:07,600
Wasted.

3842
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:14,600
I'm a Disney kid.

3843
03:38:14,680 --> 03:38:18,400
Wait, I thought it was... The picture showed Buzz Lightyear.

3844
03:38:18,440 --> 03:38:19,080
Oh, there he is.

3845
03:38:19,540 --> 03:38:21,720
I was like, I thought I was playing as...

3846
03:38:25,260 --> 03:38:26,060
As actual...

3847
03:38:28,540 --> 03:38:29,260
What the hell?

3848
03:38:29,800 --> 03:38:30,900
What are these?

3849
03:38:30,900 --> 03:38:34,040
Am I gonna play the game or is it just a trailer?

3850
03:38:35,220 --> 03:38:38,020
I can't get over the Buzz Lightyear.

3851
03:38:43,770 --> 03:38:45,390
What is going on?

3852
03:38:47,770 --> 03:38:48,870
Oh wow.

3853
03:38:50,910 --> 03:38:52,550
Disney Extreme Skate.

3854
03:38:52,730 --> 03:38:57,080
Oh, I think...

3855
03:38:57,080 --> 03:38:58,680
Before mods we had this game.

3856
03:39:01,300 --> 03:39:03,180
Okay, we can be Ryan.

3857
03:39:03,180 --> 03:39:03,400
We can be Ryan.

3858
03:39:06,040 --> 03:39:07,760
We can be Mally.

3859
03:39:12,820 --> 03:39:13,300
Simba.

3860
03:39:14,120 --> 03:39:16,580
Who gets no... Oh, not available in demo.

3861
03:39:16,900 --> 03:39:17,600
Okay, that's so sad.

3862
03:39:17,960 --> 03:39:18,960
Wait, no, Mickey!

3863
03:39:19,560 --> 03:39:23,810
They won't even let us choose him.

3864
03:39:23,850 --> 03:39:26,030
It doesn't even say not available in demo.

3865
03:39:26,850 --> 03:39:27,770
Oh my gosh.

3866
03:39:27,890 --> 03:39:28,650
Oh, we can be Woody.

3867
03:39:31,570 --> 03:39:32,650
I wanna be Buzz.

3868
03:39:32,770 --> 03:39:33,190
Yes!

3869
03:39:35,410 --> 03:39:36,330
We can be Zurg.

3870
03:39:36,390 --> 03:39:37,430
That's kind of awesome.

3871
03:39:39,650 --> 03:39:40,130
Tantor.

3872
03:39:41,210 --> 03:39:43,170
Okay, I don't want to be the real people.

3873
03:39:43,310 --> 03:39:43,730
That sucks.

3874
03:39:43,830 --> 03:39:44,590
Let's be Buzz.

3875
03:39:47,250 --> 03:39:48,230
And be Zurg.

3876
03:39:48,370 --> 03:39:49,390
Oh my god.

3877
03:39:49,550 --> 03:39:51,670
He's coming for us, you guys.

3878
03:39:54,710 --> 03:39:56,070
Oh, Angry Man.

3879
03:39:56,290 --> 03:39:56,990
Oh, Army Man.

3880
03:40:02,110 --> 03:40:02,590
Skate.

3881
03:40:02,590 --> 03:40:03,390
Skate.

3882
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:06,590
Okay, one, two...

3883
03:40:07,350 --> 03:40:09,350
Oh, is this copyright?

3884
03:40:09,510 --> 03:40:10,010
I don't know.

3885
03:40:10,270 --> 03:40:10,890
Oh my gosh.

3886
03:40:14,350 --> 03:40:15,370
It's okay, Buzz.

3887
03:40:15,410 --> 03:40:16,030
You got this.

3888
03:40:17,150 --> 03:40:18,070
Yeah, baby.

3889
03:40:18,830 --> 03:40:20,010
Oh, we're fine.

3890
03:40:20,810 --> 03:40:22,030
Yeah, we got this, guys.

3891
03:40:22,110 --> 03:40:22,630
We got this.

3892
03:40:23,330 --> 03:40:25,250
Oh gosh, he's really like limpy.

3893
03:40:26,110 --> 03:40:28,270
He's just flopping all over the place, this guy.

3894
03:40:30,070 --> 03:40:31,550
Yeah, baby.

3895
03:40:33,450 --> 03:40:36,130
Maybe I should've... Oh, we did a trick just then?

3896
03:40:36,290 --> 03:40:38,350
I don't know what the hell we just did, but...

3897
03:40:38,350 --> 03:40:38,950
What is this?

3898
03:40:40,050 --> 03:40:41,210
Oh, nice.

3899
03:40:42,670 --> 03:40:43,910
Not today, Zurg.

3900
03:40:48,500 --> 03:40:49,720
How do I stop it though?

3901
03:40:49,820 --> 03:40:50,400
Oh, nice.

3902
03:40:53,620 --> 03:40:54,040
Oh,

3903
03:40:57,870 --> 03:40:58,930
there's another person over here.

3904
03:41:00,970 --> 03:41:02,090
What did you guys say to me?

3905
03:41:10,550 --> 03:41:10,910
Now?

3906
03:41:15,270 --> 03:41:15,710
Oh, okay.

3907
03:41:19,070 --> 03:41:19,610
This way?

3908
03:41:20,730 --> 03:41:21,570
Oh, this way, this way.

3909
03:41:22,570 --> 03:41:23,170
Oh.

3910
03:41:25,350 --> 03:41:27,530
Sorry, I'm on a different journey now?

3911
03:41:29,250 --> 03:41:29,570
What?

3912
03:41:33,500 --> 03:41:35,160
Stop me, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

3913
03:41:41,330 --> 03:41:41,930
Wow.

3914
03:41:43,150 --> 03:41:44,970
The way Buzz moves is hilarious.

3915
03:41:45,210 --> 03:41:46,390
It really is so funny.

3916
03:41:47,430 --> 03:41:48,450
I'm not an army man.

3917
03:41:48,510 --> 03:41:48,950
I'm busy.

3918
03:41:50,110 --> 03:41:53,010
I'm collecting the letters to spell skate, okay?

3919
03:41:53,810 --> 03:41:55,650
Leave me out of this.

3920
03:41:55,650 --> 03:41:57,610
Leave me out of here.

3921
03:41:57,650 --> 03:41:58,230
Okay, hold on.

3922
03:41:58,550 --> 03:41:59,330
Let's get on here.

3923
03:41:59,750 --> 03:42:00,750
No, no, no.

3924
03:42:01,290 --> 03:42:02,430
How do I get in there?

3925
03:42:04,350 --> 03:42:05,450
We're gonna go up here.

3926
03:42:05,650 --> 03:42:05,850
Alright.

3927
03:42:06,950 --> 03:42:07,690
Alright, here we go.

3928
03:42:08,690 --> 03:42:09,610
We get the soap.

3929
03:42:11,090 --> 03:42:11,550
Nice.

3930
03:42:12,730 --> 03:42:16,230
I don't know how we're skating upwards, but this is really impressive.

3931
03:42:16,810 --> 03:42:17,610
There's a penguin!

3932
03:42:17,610 --> 03:42:20,610
I lost my squeaker.

3933
03:42:20,830 --> 03:42:22,370
Could you help me find it?

3934
03:42:24,810 --> 03:42:25,150
Is that it?

3935
03:42:25,170 --> 03:42:25,910
At the very top?

3936
03:42:26,170 --> 03:42:27,370
Is that what you're trying to imply?

3937
03:42:27,890 --> 03:42:28,250
Nah.

3938
03:42:28,850 --> 03:42:29,570
Sorry, guy.

3939
03:42:29,690 --> 03:42:30,410
I can't help you.

3940
03:42:30,550 --> 03:42:31,190
I'm skating.

3941
03:42:31,930 --> 03:42:33,550
I'm going on my own pathway.

3942
03:42:34,810 --> 03:42:35,250
Oh gosh.

3943
03:42:35,450 --> 03:42:36,330
Buzz, I'm getting dizzy.

3944
03:42:37,050 --> 03:42:38,090
Buzz, where does this lead?

3945
03:42:38,690 --> 03:42:40,130
That was really anticlimactic.

3946
03:42:42,570 --> 03:42:45,430
And then... Shut up.

3947
03:42:45,450 --> 03:42:46,490
I don't want to get copyright.

3948
03:42:47,290 --> 03:42:48,830
With old Disney music.

3949
03:42:49,790 --> 03:42:50,890
You gotta shred.

3950
03:42:51,530 --> 03:42:52,550
Yeah, we gotta shred.

3951
03:42:52,950 --> 03:42:54,110
Where's the rest of the letters?

3952
03:42:56,370 --> 03:42:57,890
Oh, we made that!

3953
03:42:59,550 --> 03:43:00,510
Oh god!

3954
03:43:00,630 --> 03:43:01,050
Oh god.

3955
03:43:02,950 --> 03:43:04,790
This music is dangerous.

3956
03:43:05,050 --> 03:43:06,070
Maybe I should leave.

3957
03:43:06,570 --> 03:43:07,090
Oh no!

3958
03:43:10,350 --> 03:43:12,590
I think I should leave the game.

3959
03:43:14,550 --> 03:43:17,110
Where's your head at?

3960
03:43:18,850 --> 03:43:20,530
Yeah, this is copyright for sure.

3961
03:43:20,690 --> 03:43:22,010
I think...

3962
03:43:22,010 --> 03:43:23,130
I think I've had enough.

3963
03:43:23,650 --> 03:43:24,350
Get me out of here.

3964
03:43:26,010 --> 03:43:26,630
Exit demo.

3965
03:43:29,190 --> 03:43:32,350
My stream is gonna get taken down by the mouse, you guys.

3966
03:43:32,350 --> 03:43:32,770
What?

3967
03:43:38,490 --> 03:43:42,630
Did you know yesterday was exactly the 20 year anniversary of Snake Eater's release?

3968
03:43:42,750 --> 03:43:43,510
I did know that.

3969
03:43:43,610 --> 03:43:46,850
That's why yesterday in my karaoke I sang Snake Eater.

3970
03:43:47,090 --> 03:43:50,230
Play your favorite movie's wireless DVD remote controller.

3971
03:43:51,110 --> 03:43:52,250
For the PS2.

3972
03:43:58,250 --> 03:43:58,810
OK.

3973
03:43:59,650 --> 03:44:01,550
I'm not really feeling anything else in this one.

3974
03:44:02,250 --> 03:44:03,690
I think I'm gonna...

3975
03:44:04,600 --> 03:44:06,870
Go to the last disc.

3976
03:44:07,910 --> 03:44:10,250
Which has something I do really wanna play.

3977
03:44:10,710 --> 03:44:14,690
And I have actually something that I need to do in about...

3978
03:44:19,430 --> 03:44:20,770
In about an hour.

3979
03:44:22,370 --> 03:44:23,530
I can't go over.

3980
03:44:27,830 --> 03:44:28,450
So...

3981
03:44:30,310 --> 03:44:32,250
Let's do the last...

3982
03:44:33,390 --> 03:44:34,890
Let's do the last disc.

3983
03:44:35,810 --> 03:44:37,850
There's one thing on here I really do wanna do.

3984
03:44:39,090 --> 03:44:41,030
We can try some other things on here as well.

3985
03:44:41,430 --> 03:44:43,290
But not Beautiful Joe 2.

3986
03:44:43,610 --> 03:44:46,610
Because I don't want my save to be...

3987
03:44:52,810 --> 03:44:53,330
Alright.

3988
03:44:53,330 --> 03:44:53,850
Alright!

3989
03:45:02,400 --> 03:45:04,920
I think we have a better game on this one.

3990
03:45:11,470 --> 03:45:13,690
Oh, my... I just realized my...

3991
03:45:14,990 --> 03:45:17,690
My memory card isn't even plugged in.

3992
03:45:21,230 --> 03:45:22,250
I just noticed.

3993
03:45:22,450 --> 03:45:23,170
I was not even in.

3994
03:45:24,010 --> 03:45:25,310
I guess we could do it.

3995
03:45:32,410 --> 03:45:34,710
I'm so excited for the intros.

3996
03:45:34,870 --> 03:45:35,790
Oh, there was one.

3997
03:45:37,610 --> 03:45:39,470
Why would you do this to me?

3998
03:45:41,310 --> 03:45:41,890
Oh,

3999
03:45:57,410 --> 03:45:58,150
my gosh.

4000
03:45:58,210 --> 03:45:58,850
I was like...

4001
03:45:58,850 --> 03:46:00,390
I love the intros to these.

4002
03:46:06,330 --> 03:46:07,410
So funny.

4003
03:46:09,550 --> 03:46:09,810
OK.

4004
03:46:10,830 --> 03:46:11,850
We have Jack 3.

4005
03:46:12,110 --> 03:46:13,150
We have Ratchet and Clank.

4006
03:46:13,250 --> 03:46:14,930
We have Spyro, A Hero's Tale.

4007
03:46:15,650 --> 03:46:16,370
There it is.

4008
03:46:16,810 --> 03:46:18,190
Beautiful Joe 2.

4009
03:46:18,710 --> 03:46:20,050
We have the Incredibles!

4010
03:46:21,130 --> 03:46:22,770
We have Tuck 2.

4011
03:46:23,190 --> 03:46:23,890
Oh, my gosh.

4012
03:46:26,170 --> 03:46:28,590
I completely forgot this was a game.

4013
03:46:28,850 --> 03:46:30,990
We have Crash Twinsanity.

4014
03:46:31,750 --> 03:46:34,850
We have Escamapa!

4015
03:46:44,420 --> 03:46:46,620
I had this disc in my saves.

4016
03:46:47,900 --> 03:46:49,060
Tuck 2.

4017
03:46:49,280 --> 03:46:49,440
Oh.

4018
03:46:49,660 --> 03:46:50,000
No!

4019
03:46:50,400 --> 03:46:50,560
No!

4020
03:47:12,060 --> 03:47:14,400
We have Star Wars Battlefront.

4021
03:47:14,880 --> 03:47:17,500
ATB Offroad Fury 3.

4022
03:47:18,320 --> 03:47:19,080
That's it.

4023
03:47:22,480 --> 03:47:24,780
I've never played Jak and Daxter.

4024
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:29,960
What do you mean?

4025
03:47:30,040 --> 03:47:31,100
These are the menu controls.

4026
03:47:31,320 --> 03:47:33,280
Select menu item on previous screen.

4027
03:47:33,460 --> 03:47:33,600
What?

4028
03:47:43,350 --> 03:47:45,250
Better selection than the last disc.

4029
03:47:45,350 --> 03:47:45,910
I agree.

4030
03:47:46,370 --> 03:47:47,930
The last disc...

4031
03:47:47,930 --> 03:47:50,030
Like I said...

4032
03:47:50,030 --> 03:47:53,370
It doesn't have the games listed on it.

4033
03:47:53,370 --> 03:47:55,370
And I also don't have the...

4034
03:47:56,070 --> 03:47:57,370
Like anything that...

4035
03:47:58,510 --> 03:48:00,470
Like a case or anything for it.

4036
03:48:00,490 --> 03:48:02,170
So I had no idea what was on it.

4037
03:48:12,530 --> 03:48:13,970
I'm waiting for this moment.

4038
03:48:19,590 --> 03:48:22,090
I don't remember the PS1 sound.

4039
03:48:23,470 --> 03:48:26,070
What did the PS1 sound like?

4040
03:48:34,750 --> 03:48:36,190
What is this?

4041
03:48:36,210 --> 03:48:38,110
Is this spoilers?

4042
03:48:41,390 --> 03:48:42,670
Life?

4043
03:48:47,250 --> 03:48:50,050
This freak?

4044
03:48:52,750 --> 03:48:55,030
Holy boobs!

4045
03:49:02,570 --> 03:49:03,270
Yeah!

4046
03:49:03,350 --> 03:49:05,310
I don't know Aaron.

4047
03:49:09,110 --> 03:49:09,150
Jak?

4048
03:49:18,530 --> 03:49:21,330
Holy moly!

4049
03:49:21,330 --> 03:49:23,390
I promise.

4050
03:49:31,570 --> 03:49:33,590
They are talking so fast.

4051
03:49:43,650 --> 03:49:47,010
Who is the monkey?

4052
03:49:48,510 --> 03:49:51,190
I know Daxter.

4053
03:49:56,770 --> 03:49:58,310
He doesn't have a beak.

4054
03:49:58,370 --> 03:49:59,110
He's a monkey.

4055
03:50:02,130 --> 03:50:02,490
Oh no.

4056
03:50:02,810 --> 03:50:03,830
He's going to die.

4057
03:50:05,330 --> 03:50:05,870
He's going to die.

4058
03:50:10,350 --> 03:50:21,770
I don't know what's going on.

4059
03:50:23,950 --> 03:50:24,290
Oh!

4060
03:50:27,830 --> 03:50:29,910
I'm getting spoiled completely.

4061
03:50:33,210 --> 03:50:35,030
Wasn't... Didn't he like have a glow up?

4062
03:50:35,110 --> 03:50:36,130
Like he was...

4063
03:50:36,130 --> 03:50:41,050
Like Jak was like really young and then in the second game he turned old.

4064
03:50:51,130 --> 03:50:52,870
Everyone got a glow up.

4065
03:50:53,730 --> 03:50:54,670
Oh no!

4066
03:50:59,650 --> 03:51:00,550
Ah man.

4067
03:51:01,070 --> 03:51:01,410
Oh no.

4068
03:51:02,250 --> 03:51:02,670
Oh god.

4069
03:51:05,410 --> 03:51:08,070
His ears are so long!

4070
03:51:08,590 --> 03:51:11,430
They are so long!

4071
03:51:14,030 --> 03:51:15,430
Chicken.

4072
03:51:18,570 --> 03:51:21,970
Family guy death pose.

4073
03:51:42,990 --> 03:51:43,710
Oh my god.

4074
03:51:49,210 --> 03:51:51,450
Oh we hate those guys.

4075
03:51:52,210 --> 03:51:53,190
The metal heads.

4076
03:51:56,890 --> 03:51:57,450
Jiggle.

4077
03:51:57,870 --> 03:51:58,750
Where are you guys looking?

4078
03:52:00,310 --> 03:52:01,110
Stop it!

4079
03:52:04,230 --> 03:52:06,130
Is there only three games in this?

4080
03:52:07,650 --> 03:52:08,610
Jak 1, 2, 3.

4081
03:52:18,540 --> 03:52:20,320
4 if you include the racer.

4082
03:52:20,580 --> 03:52:21,640
Ah there are some spin offs.

4083
03:52:22,540 --> 03:52:23,900
A racing game.

4084
03:52:24,380 --> 03:52:25,480
A Daxter game.

4085
03:52:31,480 --> 03:52:33,060
He's second dead.

4086
03:52:35,520 --> 03:52:35,880
No!

4087
03:52:36,020 --> 03:52:36,680
He's dead!

4088
03:52:44,420 --> 03:52:45,560
He's dead.

4089
03:52:47,120 --> 03:52:49,040
Everything is happening so fast.

4090
03:52:49,700 --> 03:52:52,060
He didn't even give him a chance to answer.

4091
03:52:52,240 --> 03:52:53,480
Then he's like I smell a storm.

4092
03:52:53,640 --> 03:52:55,620
Well the storm is already here.

4093
03:52:57,000 --> 03:52:58,380
Wow it's beautiful.

4094
03:53:00,520 --> 03:53:02,560
Everything is happening so fast.

4095
03:53:02,560 --> 03:53:04,320
Oh demo missions.

4096
03:53:04,420 --> 03:53:05,360
Watch intro movie.

4097
03:53:05,800 --> 03:53:07,180
Destroy metal head beasts.

4098
03:53:07,860 --> 03:53:09,160
Explore Ecomind.

4099
03:53:09,980 --> 03:53:11,860
Escort...ok no escort mission please.

4100
03:53:12,060 --> 03:53:14,240
Let's destroy some metal heads.

4101
03:53:14,900 --> 03:53:15,940
Exit vehicle.

4102
03:53:16,200 --> 03:53:17,000
Oh no.

4103
03:53:17,120 --> 03:53:18,120
Wait I have to drive.

4104
03:53:18,320 --> 03:53:18,640
Oh no.

4105
03:53:18,800 --> 03:53:18,860
Wait.

4106
03:53:19,240 --> 03:53:20,640
I can't...go back.

4107
03:53:21,300 --> 03:53:22,140
Wait, wait, wait.

4108
03:53:22,220 --> 03:53:24,400
I thought I was going to use my hands.

4109
03:53:24,420 --> 03:53:24,800
Oh no!

4110
03:53:24,900 --> 03:53:25,220
Go back!

4111
03:53:37,460 --> 03:53:38,460
No!

4112
03:53:47,740 --> 03:53:48,740
No!

4113
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:52,200
He's got such big teeth.

4114
03:53:55,220 --> 03:53:57,200
A wasteland metal head?

4115
03:54:02,800 --> 03:54:05,100
Oh I think we are in trouble.

4116
03:54:05,280 --> 03:54:07,720
Oh I can just be me.

4117
03:54:09,720 --> 03:54:12,280
Ok, let's go kick some butt!

4118
03:54:16,840 --> 03:54:19,200
Let's go kick some butt!

4119
03:54:21,700 --> 03:54:22,820
Over this way.

4120
03:54:25,220 --> 03:54:27,040
Do I have to take the car?

4121
03:54:29,180 --> 03:54:30,520
You'll need the car?

4122
03:54:31,120 --> 03:54:34,220
Oh I think I need the car to...

4123
03:54:34,920 --> 03:54:36,100
Then we can go around.

4124
03:54:38,520 --> 03:54:39,440
Ok this way.

4125
03:54:41,780 --> 03:54:43,140
It's only four of them guys.

4126
03:54:43,200 --> 03:54:43,800
We got this.

4127
03:54:44,380 --> 03:54:44,560
Alright.

4128
03:54:45,000 --> 03:54:45,200
Jump.

4129
03:54:45,380 --> 03:54:45,760
Double jump.

4130
03:54:49,110 --> 03:54:51,150
It will be a long walk.

4131
03:54:52,450 --> 03:54:53,370
What's in this way?

4132
03:54:56,110 --> 03:54:58,310
We can explore the whole world as a rooster.

4133
03:55:00,710 --> 03:55:00,950
Uh oh.

4134
03:55:01,130 --> 03:55:03,050
Did the door shut on me?

4135
03:55:03,890 --> 03:55:04,690
Oh wait a second.

4136
03:55:04,950 --> 03:55:05,530
Ok, phew.

4137
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:11,400
We are fine.

4138
03:55:11,660 --> 03:55:12,360
Everything is fine.

4139
03:55:13,560 --> 03:55:15,160
Oh there is our car I think.

4140
03:55:16,500 --> 03:55:18,400
Let's get the most power.

4141
03:55:18,520 --> 03:55:20,560
Let's pick God's chosen car.

4142
03:55:21,640 --> 03:55:22,500
Oh God.

4143
03:55:25,180 --> 03:55:27,440
Ok guys, this is fine probably.

4144
03:55:29,020 --> 03:55:30,700
This is probably ok.

4145
03:55:30,940 --> 03:55:32,500
Ok this is the brakes.

4146
03:55:34,200 --> 03:55:36,600
Then press R1 to fire.

4147
03:55:37,620 --> 03:55:38,240
Ok, ok.

4148
03:55:38,820 --> 03:55:40,660
It's giving us a little tutorial while we go.

4149
03:55:41,020 --> 03:55:43,520
I see one.

4150
03:55:49,420 --> 03:55:51,440
It does not drift?

4151
03:55:52,780 --> 03:55:53,740
Mad mint.

4152
03:56:04,480 --> 03:56:05,240
Maybe not.

4153
03:56:05,340 --> 03:56:05,740
Nevermind.

4154
03:56:06,360 --> 03:56:06,740
Turn around.

4155
03:56:07,880 --> 03:56:09,340
You can drift if you press L1.

4156
03:56:10,060 --> 03:56:10,560
Let's see.

4157
03:56:11,440 --> 03:56:12,500
Oh kind of.

4158
03:56:12,780 --> 03:56:14,360
It does give you a little bit of a hoop.

4159
03:56:15,820 --> 03:56:17,980
Is that guy going to attack me or what are you doing man?

4160
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:29,980
The next one.

4161
03:56:59,030 --> 03:57:00,310
There is two over here.

4162
03:57:00,470 --> 03:57:02,110
I don't know if we want to... Oh did he leave?

4163
03:57:02,110 --> 03:57:03,190
Did he leave?

4164
03:57:06,100 --> 03:57:07,100
Oh I hear him.

4165
03:57:07,300 --> 03:57:08,020
Right behind me.

4166
03:57:08,760 --> 03:57:09,600
He is coming after me.

4167
03:57:09,700 --> 03:57:09,980
Maybe...

4168
03:57:10,540 --> 03:57:12,960
Oh he is trying to destroy me.

4169
03:57:19,120 --> 03:57:20,340
Let's avoid that.

4170
03:57:20,780 --> 03:57:22,880
Where the hell does this guy keep going to?

4171
03:57:24,720 --> 03:57:25,480
You know what?

4172
03:57:25,780 --> 03:57:27,180
Let's leave this guy for now.

4173
03:57:27,220 --> 03:57:27,820
Oh there we go.

4174
03:57:31,380 --> 03:57:34,360
I could just shoot at them.

4175
03:57:37,900 --> 03:57:40,040
I'm not hitting any shot.

4176
03:57:42,740 --> 03:57:44,020
Where does he go to?

4177
03:57:44,120 --> 03:57:44,540
Over here.

4178
03:57:48,620 --> 03:57:50,620
Guys, we are gaming.

4179
03:57:51,280 --> 03:57:52,080
Freaky road.

4180
03:57:52,960 --> 03:57:53,820
Freaky, freaky.

4181
03:57:54,600 --> 03:57:57,820
So if I get out of the car...

4182
03:57:58,420 --> 03:57:58,920
Oh my god.

4183
03:58:03,160 --> 03:58:04,380
I'm on his ass.

4184
03:58:04,440 --> 03:58:05,240
I'm on his ass.

4185
03:58:05,620 --> 03:58:07,660
We are fine.

4186
03:58:11,840 --> 03:58:13,740
I don't know where he... Oh there he is.

4187
03:58:14,380 --> 03:58:15,180
Oh shit.

4188
03:58:20,730 --> 03:58:21,990
I still have two left.

4189
03:58:23,370 --> 03:58:24,350
We got this.

4190
03:58:26,110 --> 03:58:26,990
We got this.

4191
03:58:28,870 --> 03:58:31,350
Ok this isn't as bad as... Oh sorry.

4192
03:58:31,890 --> 03:58:34,430
I was going to say...

4193
03:58:34,430 --> 03:58:39,890
This isn't as bad of a driving as I thought it would be.

4194
03:58:42,870 --> 03:58:44,810
But we are fine.

4195
03:58:44,870 --> 03:58:46,150
Everything is fine everybody.

4196
03:58:49,470 --> 03:58:50,530
What the hell?

4197
03:58:51,290 --> 03:58:53,970
I sometimes think I have controller drift.

4198
03:58:56,630 --> 03:58:57,150
Oh my gosh.

4199
03:58:57,810 --> 03:59:03,970
I don't know where I am.

4200
03:59:04,690 --> 03:59:05,670
Turn around.

4201
03:59:16,900 --> 03:59:17,340
Ok.

4202
03:59:22,890 --> 03:59:24,630
Is that the sun over there?

4203
03:59:24,730 --> 03:59:25,930
It's so purple.

4204
03:59:26,230 --> 03:59:27,070
Avoid the tree?

4205
03:59:27,590 --> 03:59:28,170
Ok hold on.

4206
03:59:28,750 --> 03:59:29,490
Where is this guy?

4207
03:59:29,930 --> 03:59:30,690
There he is!

4208
03:59:33,830 --> 03:59:34,970
I think we are fine.

4209
03:59:35,250 --> 03:59:35,690
Honestly.

4210
03:59:37,010 --> 03:59:41,190
I think this guy... I think we don't even... I think this guy does not stand a chance against us.

4211
03:59:41,490 --> 03:59:41,950
Just saying.

4212
03:59:43,350 --> 03:59:45,050
I wish there was a reverse button.

4213
03:59:45,050 --> 03:59:46,670
Is this reverse?

4214
03:59:47,810 --> 03:59:48,850
Maybe this is reverse.

4215
03:59:51,630 --> 03:59:52,570
This is reverse.

4216
03:59:52,910 --> 03:59:53,770
Ok, ok, ok.

4217
03:59:57,210 --> 03:59:57,850
This way?

4218
04:00:09,600 --> 04:00:10,800
Just one more.

4219
04:00:11,920 --> 04:00:12,880
Where is this guy?

4220
04:00:13,620 --> 04:00:15,900
All the way...

4221
04:00:15,900 --> 04:00:16,540
Oh my gosh.

4222
04:00:16,580 --> 04:00:17,280
You guys weren't kidding.

4223
04:00:17,440 --> 04:00:19,360
This would have been the longest hike ever.

4224
04:00:20,340 --> 04:00:21,200
1 HP?

4225
04:00:23,020 --> 04:00:25,100
No, we have more than 1 HP.

4226
04:00:31,460 --> 04:00:32,640
Back it up.

4227
04:00:32,700 --> 04:00:33,220
Back it up.

4228
04:00:35,240 --> 04:00:36,400
I wish I could turn the camera.

4229
04:00:36,500 --> 04:00:36,900
There we go.

4230
04:00:37,040 --> 04:00:37,300
Alright.

4231
04:00:40,260 --> 04:00:42,300
What's that green thing on the map?

4232
04:00:51,930 --> 04:00:53,310
We are fine.

4233
04:00:54,370 --> 04:00:55,510
Everything is good.

4234
04:00:55,710 --> 04:00:55,910
See?

4235
04:00:57,350 --> 04:00:58,990
Turn that around.

4236
04:00:59,450 --> 04:01:02,110
What's that green thing on the map?

4237
04:01:09,670 --> 04:01:10,850
Yeah, I did a flip.

4238
04:01:15,950 --> 04:01:17,010
Ok, here it comes.

4239
04:01:23,830 --> 04:01:24,170
Yeah!

4240
04:01:25,430 --> 04:01:26,650
We took him down!

4241
04:01:27,570 --> 04:01:28,210
Oh, nevermind.

4242
04:01:28,530 --> 04:01:29,750
I thought we did.

4243
04:01:30,030 --> 04:01:30,630
Just kidding.

4244
04:01:30,770 --> 04:01:32,190
We almost took him down.

4245
04:01:32,190 --> 04:01:34,250
What the hell man!

4246
04:01:34,690 --> 04:01:35,650
You are dead!

4247
04:01:58,770 --> 04:02:00,230
For real this time.

4248
04:02:00,830 --> 04:02:01,390
Maybe?

4249
04:02:02,210 --> 04:02:02,490
Did we?

4250
04:02:11,490 --> 04:02:16,860
I didn't even hit him.

4251
04:02:29,840 --> 04:02:31,080
That's what we got.

4252
04:02:34,160 --> 04:02:36,220
I like the sound of your voice.

4253
04:02:40,680 --> 04:02:41,200
Spoilers?

4254
04:02:41,580 --> 04:02:42,520
I do not perceive.

4255
04:02:44,020 --> 04:02:44,460
Who is that?

4256
04:02:52,140 --> 04:02:52,660
Wow.

4257
04:02:52,660 --> 04:02:53,820
This is so long.

4258
04:02:53,880 --> 04:02:54,400
Just kidding.

4259
04:02:57,260 --> 04:02:59,820
That was the Jack 3.

4260
04:03:00,840 --> 04:03:01,960
How do I get out of here?

4261
04:03:03,540 --> 04:03:04,860
Let me out please.

4262
04:03:05,760 --> 04:03:07,620
Let me go back to the main menu.

4263
04:03:16,530 --> 04:03:17,870
Select start doesn't work.

4264
04:03:17,950 --> 04:03:19,210
It just takes me to this menu.

4265
04:03:20,170 --> 04:03:21,990
Takes me to the demo missions.

4266
04:03:23,950 --> 04:03:25,310
Select start doesn't work.

4267
04:03:26,670 --> 04:03:29,050
I might have to actually restart the whole... Oh my god.

4268
04:03:29,490 --> 04:03:30,670
I'm going to restart the whole console.

4269
04:03:34,160 --> 04:03:35,520
I guess we will hard reset.

4270
04:03:39,220 --> 04:03:40,420
That's so stinky.

4271
04:03:43,800 --> 04:03:44,320
L1.

4272
04:03:44,540 --> 04:03:45,980
Oh, well I already did it.

4273
04:03:47,380 --> 04:03:49,720
All shoulder buttons plus select start.

4274
04:03:49,860 --> 04:03:52,880
It almost didn't read it for a second.

4275
04:03:53,560 --> 04:03:56,020
I have limited time so I want to do Ace Combat.

4276
04:03:58,580 --> 04:04:00,220
I have a limited time.

4277
04:04:01,100 --> 04:04:05,320
It's also been like 4 hours of just demos.

4278
04:04:11,940 --> 04:04:13,800
Ace Combat baby!

4279
04:04:14,100 --> 04:04:15,960
I also wanted to do the Incredibles.

4280
04:04:16,880 --> 04:04:18,040
But that's OK.

4281
04:04:19,000 --> 04:04:21,280
Oh my

4282
04:04:42,040 --> 04:04:42,540
gosh.

4283
04:04:49,500 --> 04:04:51,100
No, I was just reading.

4284
04:04:57,100 --> 04:05:04,220
It's just... I'm starting with Ace Combat 5 so...

4285
04:05:07,220 --> 04:05:07,880
It's...

4286
04:05:12,040 --> 04:05:13,200
It's time.

4287
04:05:15,200 --> 04:05:17,380
Oh gosh.

4288
04:05:17,540 --> 04:05:19,100
It's a little complicated.

4289
04:05:19,960 --> 04:05:21,560
It's OK.

4290
04:05:39,160 --> 04:05:48,260
The song of the bird echoed in words.

4291
04:05:48,640 --> 04:05:50,460
Number 5.

4292
04:05:58,660 --> 04:06:02,320
This looks so good.

4293
04:06:09,760 --> 04:06:12,460
A war tears two nations apart.

4294
04:06:20,750 --> 04:06:23,840
A war fueled by courage.

4295
04:06:25,680 --> 04:06:26,720
By hatred.

4296
04:06:27,020 --> 04:06:27,800
Oh, not by courage.

4297
04:06:39,160 --> 04:06:39,660
Ah!

4298
04:07:45,430 --> 04:07:48,570
These people may well be the story I was looking for all this time.

4299
04:07:49,050 --> 04:07:51,430
In fact, I was sure of it.

4300
04:08:15,750 --> 04:08:16,630
So awesome!

4301
04:08:21,270 --> 04:08:22,150
Oh gosh.

4302
04:08:23,270 --> 04:08:24,930
Sorry, I'm just in advance.

4303
04:08:25,030 --> 04:08:26,670
I'm going to be so bad with the controls.

4304
04:08:28,530 --> 04:08:32,250
But it's been a long time since I played Ace Combat 7 so...

4305
04:08:33,610 --> 04:08:35,130
I'm on my hands and knees.

4306
04:08:35,310 --> 04:08:36,130
You must play this.

4307
04:08:36,270 --> 04:08:36,750
Of course!

4308
04:08:37,390 --> 04:08:40,890
I have... I own the whole Ace Combat series, you guys.

4309
04:08:41,350 --> 04:08:43,170
I've prepared for this moment.

4310
04:08:43,590 --> 04:08:48,070
Or rather, I am prepared for Ace Combat.

4311
04:08:48,590 --> 04:08:50,070
I own the entire series.

4312
04:08:51,690 --> 04:08:52,570
I know you do.

4313
04:08:52,810 --> 04:08:53,130
Yeah!

4314
04:08:54,910 --> 04:08:57,930
It's a whole lot of singing for an unsung war.

4315
04:09:00,170 --> 04:09:01,610
You have zero?

4316
04:09:06,680 --> 04:09:07,320
Yes.

4317
04:09:10,460 --> 04:09:13,100
You already got Ace Combat's skill.

4318
04:09:13,560 --> 04:09:14,980
It's called Crashing Blitz.

4319
04:09:18,320 --> 04:09:19,240
Okay.

4320
04:09:19,680 --> 04:09:19,900
Alright.

4321
04:09:20,400 --> 04:09:23,780
Let's just go for it.

4322
04:09:25,280 --> 04:09:28,020
Let's go for the...

4323
04:09:28,020 --> 04:09:28,820
F14.

4324
04:09:33,980 --> 04:09:34,460
Confirmed!

4325
04:09:34,540 --> 04:09:34,860
This one.

4326
04:09:35,700 --> 04:09:36,420
Yeah, that one.

4327
04:09:38,380 --> 04:09:38,860
Oh!

4328
04:09:39,060 --> 04:09:40,560
I get to choose each person.

4329
04:09:40,680 --> 04:09:41,220
I didn't realize.

4330
04:09:41,500 --> 04:09:43,780
Okay, we'll do...

4331
04:09:43,780 --> 04:09:44,580
Chopper.

4332
04:09:44,680 --> 04:09:44,980
Roger.

4333
04:09:47,000 --> 04:09:48,560
We'll do 2-2.

4334
04:09:50,860 --> 04:09:51,340
Roger.

4335
04:09:52,280 --> 04:09:52,760
Confirmed.

4336
04:09:55,300 --> 04:09:56,280
Let me turn it down some.

4337
04:09:56,340 --> 04:09:56,780
Oh gosh.

4338
04:09:58,020 --> 04:09:59,940
These look so much more manageable.

4339
04:10:00,860 --> 04:10:03,040
Wow, I can't believe you get to control your wingman.

4340
04:10:03,120 --> 04:10:03,720
That's so fun.

4341
04:10:03,920 --> 04:10:13,560
Oh my gosh.

4342
04:10:13,620 --> 04:10:14,060
I see them.

4343
04:10:14,580 --> 04:10:15,000
Oh gosh.

4344
04:10:18,560 --> 04:10:19,920
How do I shoot my missile?

4345
04:10:23,400 --> 04:10:24,020
Oh god.

4346
04:10:24,220 --> 04:10:24,600
Oh god.

4347
04:10:24,680 --> 04:10:25,040
Oh god.

4348
04:10:25,140 --> 04:10:25,680
Oh god!

4349
04:10:25,820 --> 04:10:26,200
Miss!

4350
04:10:27,880 --> 04:10:29,920
How do I...

4351
04:10:29,920 --> 04:10:31,480
Okay, I'm yawing.

4352
04:10:31,960 --> 04:10:32,340
Oh god.

4353
04:10:33,200 --> 04:10:33,540
Miss!

4354
04:10:33,640 --> 04:10:34,720
Why am I missing?

4355
04:10:37,360 --> 04:10:38,220
Come on!

4356
04:10:38,580 --> 04:10:39,140
Miss!

4357
04:10:39,900 --> 04:10:40,640
Oh my gosh.

4358
04:10:40,700 --> 04:10:41,280
Get closer.

4359
04:10:42,960 --> 04:10:43,640
The controls.

4360
04:10:43,860 --> 04:10:44,280
Oh my god.

4361
04:10:44,460 --> 04:10:45,200
Oh god.

4362
04:10:45,360 --> 04:10:45,720
The controls.

4363
04:10:47,340 --> 04:10:49,540
I'm just gonna...

4364
04:10:50,020 --> 04:10:50,560
I hit!

4365
04:10:50,660 --> 04:10:51,020
I hit!

4366
04:10:53,220 --> 04:10:54,820
There we go.

4367
04:10:56,000 --> 04:10:56,660
Hit!

4368
04:10:57,120 --> 04:10:57,820
And one more!

4369
04:10:59,880 --> 04:11:00,220
Hit!

4370
04:11:00,720 --> 04:11:01,040
Yeah!

4371
04:11:02,640 --> 04:11:03,960
Where's that other guy go?

4372
04:11:07,340 --> 04:11:09,120
There's my teams over there.

4373
04:11:09,240 --> 04:11:09,740
Sharp down.

4374
04:11:12,800 --> 04:11:13,960
Where is it?

4375
04:11:16,320 --> 04:11:17,180
There it is.

4376
04:11:19,560 --> 04:11:20,980
I'm already so excited.

4377
04:11:21,400 --> 04:11:22,120
I can't wait to play.

4378
04:11:23,460 --> 04:11:26,180
I wonder if I can...

4379
04:11:29,060 --> 04:11:31,140
How do I lock on?

4380
04:11:31,540 --> 04:11:32,040
There we go.

4381
04:11:33,200 --> 04:11:33,840
Hit!

4382
04:11:35,020 --> 04:11:35,360
Hit!

4383
04:11:36,160 --> 04:11:36,480
And...

4384
04:11:54,750 --> 04:11:55,650
Destroyed, baby!

4385
04:11:57,750 --> 04:12:01,210
How do I, like... How do I go faster and stuff?

4386
04:12:03,990 --> 04:12:06,090
I feel like the controls are very automated.

4387
04:12:10,090 --> 04:12:10,890
Free select?

4388
04:12:11,710 --> 04:12:14,850
Wait, I think this was...

4389
04:12:14,850 --> 04:12:16,370
Oh, there's like so many things.

4390
04:12:17,350 --> 04:12:18,090
Okay, hold on.

4391
04:12:18,150 --> 04:12:19,210
Alright, we're going in.

4392
04:12:19,350 --> 04:12:23,690
Oh, my thing is... My YouTube chat is broken, so if you're trying to tell me stuff, I cannot see!

4393
04:12:24,590 --> 04:12:26,390
My YouTube chat is broken again, guys.

4394
04:12:26,470 --> 04:12:26,730
Sorry.

4395
04:12:27,650 --> 04:12:28,030
Come on.

4396
04:12:28,110 --> 04:12:29,710
Actually, let's go change to this guy.

4397
04:12:30,730 --> 04:12:31,050
Can I?

4398
04:12:31,170 --> 04:12:31,570
There we go.

4399
04:12:31,750 --> 04:12:32,370
I think he's closer.

4400
04:12:34,410 --> 04:12:36,610
I'm just shaking all over the place.

4401
04:12:40,810 --> 04:12:41,690
Oh God.

4402
04:12:42,430 --> 04:12:42,870
Warning?

4403
04:12:47,790 --> 04:12:49,010
It didn't hit me.

4404
04:12:49,550 --> 04:12:50,370
I'm yawning!

4405
04:12:50,370 --> 04:12:50,930
I'm yawning!

4406
04:12:54,490 --> 04:12:55,230
I'm yawning!

4407
04:12:55,330 --> 04:12:55,710
I'm yawning!

4408
04:12:55,770 --> 04:12:56,150
I'm yawning!

4409
04:12:56,230 --> 04:12:56,610
I'm yawning!

4410
04:12:56,710 --> 04:12:57,050
I'm yawning!

4411
04:12:57,190 --> 04:12:57,410
I'm yawning!

4412
04:12:57,530 --> 04:12:57,790
Hit!

4413
04:12:58,170 --> 04:12:58,850
Hit, baby!

4414
04:12:59,670 --> 04:13:00,350
Hit, baby!

4415
04:13:01,770 --> 04:13:02,450
Oh, whoops.

4416
04:13:09,230 --> 04:13:10,090
Take him down!

4417
04:13:10,570 --> 04:13:10,810
Hit!

4418
04:13:10,950 --> 04:13:11,130
Hit!

4419
04:13:13,070 --> 04:13:13,870
Where's the other guy?

4420
04:13:14,010 --> 04:13:14,670
Where did the other guy go?

4421
04:13:15,170 --> 04:13:15,770
Destroyed, baby!

4422
04:13:19,570 --> 04:13:20,370
Over here?

4423
04:13:24,370 --> 04:13:29,250
Wait, is that my...Where is he?

4424
04:13:29,630 --> 04:13:31,690
I can't tell what they look like on the...

4425
04:13:33,070 --> 04:13:34,090
Third person who?

4426
04:13:34,730 --> 04:13:35,410
I can't.

4427
04:13:35,470 --> 04:13:36,950
It won't let me switch to it.

4428
04:13:37,230 --> 04:13:37,850
I'm trying.

4429
04:13:40,950 --> 04:13:43,970
It won't let me switch to third person.

4430
04:13:47,030 --> 04:13:48,110
So I don't know.

4431
04:13:50,570 --> 04:13:51,670
Where did they go?

4432
04:13:52,010 --> 04:13:53,290
Oh gosh, they were right on me.

4433
04:13:59,970 --> 04:14:01,050
I had a feeling that was going to happen.

4434
04:14:01,090 --> 04:14:02,590
Hold on, I'm refreshing my YouTube chat.

4435
04:14:02,990 --> 04:14:03,610
One second.

4436
04:14:04,330 --> 04:14:05,550
We did a flip, guys!

4437
04:14:05,590 --> 04:14:06,110
We did a flip!

4438
04:14:11,710 --> 04:14:15,510
Yeah, I didn't hear any lady being like, pull up, pull up.

4439
04:14:15,790 --> 04:14:16,410
What the heck?

4440
04:14:26,840 --> 04:14:32,380
Guys, did you know I'm only 15k away from my goal of the year?

4441
04:14:33,780 --> 04:14:35,480
300,000 subscribers.

4442
04:14:36,360 --> 04:14:43,760
If you want more Ace Combat combat, consider subscribing and maybe tell your friends.

4443
04:14:47,520 --> 04:14:48,120
Sorry,

4444
04:14:53,160 --> 04:14:56,520
I just got reminded because I have to go to the back end to refresh my chat.

4445
04:15:01,130 --> 04:15:02,870
Did it go away?

4446
04:15:06,110 --> 04:15:09,810
I will personally find 15,000 people just to watch you play Ace Combat.

4447
04:15:22,290 --> 04:15:25,670
Wait, but I want to keep playing!

4448
04:15:32,280 --> 04:15:33,660
Where did you learn to fly?

4449
04:15:38,600 --> 04:15:39,860
What was it?

4450
04:15:39,960 --> 04:15:41,680
The shoulder buttons and then...

4451
04:15:51,620 --> 04:15:52,480
Humph!

4452
04:15:58,130 --> 04:16:00,320
John Ace Combat...

4453
04:16:02,360 --> 04:16:03,220
No!

4454
04:16:05,170 --> 04:16:09,320
This CD is super duper scratched up, so...

4455
04:16:15,880 --> 04:16:17,450
Well guys, I just have to play.

4456
04:16:17,610 --> 04:16:18,190
I think...

4457
04:16:20,030 --> 04:16:24,190
I get so indecisive because after...

4458
04:16:25,370 --> 04:16:33,250
So basically, I'm doing Devil May Cry right now and I'm doing some Metal Gear games and then I'll finish Metal Gear.

4459
04:16:34,930 --> 04:16:40,130
And I'm thinking, I can't decide after Metal Gear if I do Ace Combat or if I do Yakuza.

4460
04:16:40,290 --> 04:16:42,190
Both of them are quite long, so I'm like...

4461
04:16:42,190 --> 04:16:43,790
I don't know!

4462
04:16:49,410 --> 04:16:50,130
I

4463
04:16:53,700 --> 04:16:55,660
don't know which one to do.

4464
04:16:57,260 --> 04:16:58,680
Ace Combat is way shorter?

4465
04:16:59,120 --> 04:17:00,140
It's shorter actually.

4466
04:17:05,250 --> 04:17:06,810
What about Xenoblade?

4467
04:17:07,110 --> 04:17:12,330
Xenoblade is its own monster that I have been considering next year.

4468
04:17:13,750 --> 04:17:16,010
Yakuza is more longer than Ace Combat.

4469
04:17:16,850 --> 04:17:18,410
Maybe we can do Ace Combat.

4470
04:17:20,690 --> 04:17:27,110
Yeah, I guess because Yakuza is like roleplay stuff and then... Or like, you know, like JRPG.

4471
04:17:27,790 --> 04:17:30,210
I guess you'd consider... Would you consider JRPG?

4472
04:17:30,870 --> 04:17:32,010
And then...

4473
04:17:35,370 --> 04:17:36,450
And then...

4474
04:17:40,370 --> 04:17:41,590
There's so many games.

4475
04:17:46,530 --> 04:17:47,610
Phantom Pain.

4476
04:17:47,690 --> 04:17:49,670
Don't worry, we'll do Phantom Pain again.

4477
04:17:50,370 --> 04:17:50,810
Probably.

4478
04:17:52,490 --> 04:17:53,090
Probably.

4479
04:17:53,850 --> 04:17:54,810
Maybe with some mods.

4480
04:17:57,110 --> 04:17:57,750
Or something.

4481
04:17:58,750 --> 04:17:59,470
Armored Core?

4482
04:17:59,770 --> 04:18:01,710
I don't... I'm worried.

4483
04:18:02,570 --> 04:18:04,350
I'm worried about the backseaters.

4484
04:18:04,630 --> 04:18:05,790
There's always a Bugs Life.

4485
04:18:06,090 --> 04:18:10,090
Guys, I'm gonna become a full-time Bugs Life streamer.

4486
04:18:14,810 --> 04:18:16,010
Zone of the Enders.

4487
04:18:16,130 --> 04:18:18,050
Yeah, I do have that.

4488
04:18:18,370 --> 04:18:20,850
But Zone of the Enders... Wait, it's just Zone of the Enders 1 and 2, right?

4489
04:18:21,270 --> 04:18:25,070
I'm more thinking of like full-on series series type games.

4490
04:18:25,690 --> 04:18:34,810
Because, you know, I have those couples of series that are in my back pocket that are ones that will take a considerable amount of time.

4491
04:18:34,810 --> 04:18:41,230
So I went to... And I don't want to start so many things at once.

4492
04:18:41,310 --> 04:18:42,210
I kind of want to be like...

4493
04:18:42,210 --> 04:18:43,130
Okay, I finished this.

4494
04:18:43,190 --> 04:18:43,790
Now on to this.

4495
04:18:43,870 --> 04:18:44,310
I finished this.

4496
04:18:44,350 --> 04:18:44,810
Now on to this.

4497
04:18:46,030 --> 04:18:47,550
More of a beat-em-up than an RPG?

4498
04:18:48,350 --> 04:18:50,130
Well, you're still role-playing as a Yakuza.

4499
04:18:50,650 --> 04:18:53,670
Unless, Nicholas, do you have something you want to tell us?

4500
04:18:56,230 --> 04:18:57,350
Escape from New York?

4501
04:18:59,650 --> 04:19:00,010
Maybe.

4502
04:19:00,010 --> 04:19:00,270
Maybe.

4503
04:19:03,230 --> 04:19:06,040
I didn't... I haven't watched Escape from LA, so...

4504
04:19:10,370 --> 04:19:13,870
Maybe one night we could do a double feature.

4505
04:19:17,810 --> 04:19:18,690
John Wick.

4506
04:19:19,210 --> 04:19:19,650
Oh yeah.

4507
04:19:19,830 --> 04:19:20,650
See, there's so many things.

4508
04:19:20,950 --> 04:19:24,210
If you play Ace Combat 7 again, I can be your target practice.

4509
04:19:25,710 --> 04:19:27,070
I appreciate it, Nan.

4510
04:19:27,590 --> 04:19:28,710
Well, I'm so sorry.

4511
04:19:28,810 --> 04:19:31,070
I really wanted to play up until the end.

4512
04:19:32,350 --> 04:19:35,930
But the PS2 says I'm tired, Minto.

4513
04:19:36,190 --> 04:19:38,310
And I have stuff I gotta do.

4514
04:19:38,610 --> 04:19:40,890
So I think I'm gonna take off, you guys.

4515
04:19:40,950 --> 04:19:41,790
I'm so sorry!

4516
04:19:43,490 --> 04:19:44,290
So sorry.

4517
04:19:44,390 --> 04:19:47,190
But thank you guys for going on this little nostalgia trip.

4518
04:19:47,310 --> 04:19:50,950
We got to at least see all the discs, so that's fun.

4519
04:19:51,730 --> 04:19:56,250
It was a lot of fun for me, too, to play the Emperor's New Groove again.

4520
04:20:00,510 --> 04:20:01,390
And... yeah.

4521
04:20:03,730 --> 04:20:04,930
Life of Bug.

4522
04:20:05,970 --> 04:20:08,050
You're gonna be changing berry covers like a pro.

4523
04:20:08,350 --> 04:20:10,030
Oh, it covers colors like a pro.

4524
04:20:11,290 --> 04:20:13,210
This OG side enjoyed it very much.

4525
04:20:13,290 --> 04:20:15,690
Also, Xenoblade X is its own separate game.

4526
04:20:17,930 --> 04:20:18,710
I didn't know that.

4527
04:20:18,750 --> 04:20:19,930
Thanks for the nostalgia trip, Minto.

4528
04:20:20,050 --> 04:20:20,610
Thank you!

4529
04:20:21,090 --> 04:20:22,510
This was a lot of fun!

4530
04:20:23,170 --> 04:20:25,070
Thank you guys for letting me...

4531
04:20:26,350 --> 04:20:30,850
And for joining me for this journey down the memory lane.

4532
04:20:31,350 --> 04:20:36,110
And hopefully you guys unlock some core memories, or some memories that you're like...

4533
04:20:36,110 --> 04:20:37,870
I forgot this game even existed!

4534
04:20:38,510 --> 04:20:40,050
So, that's always fun.

4535
04:20:40,210 --> 04:20:40,410
Right?

4536
04:20:40,950 --> 04:20:45,510
Maybe I'll get some more demo discs and we can do this in the future again, too.

4537
04:20:46,950 --> 04:20:48,230
With some different ones.

4538
04:20:49,090 --> 04:20:49,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4539
04:20:49,810 --> 04:20:53,270
Anyway, thank you for putting up with my one guy nonsense.

4540
04:20:53,390 --> 04:20:54,090
You're all good!

4541
04:20:54,210 --> 04:20:54,950
Thank you!

4542
04:20:56,910 --> 04:20:57,330
Yeah!

4543
04:20:59,690 --> 04:21:00,230
Everybody,

4544
04:21:04,270 --> 04:21:05,170
thank you!

4545
04:21:05,670 --> 04:21:06,630
Thank you, thank you!

4546
04:21:07,250 --> 04:21:11,170
I'll see you guys when I see you next!

4547
04:21:11,850 --> 04:21:12,510
Bye bye!
