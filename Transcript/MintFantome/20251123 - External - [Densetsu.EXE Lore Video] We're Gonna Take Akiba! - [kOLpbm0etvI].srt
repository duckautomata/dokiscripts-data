1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,070
I'm sorry guys, but the chicken flavour definitely wins.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,210
No way.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,490
The shrimp flavour is peak.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,090
I don't know.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,010
I think the beef is really tasty.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,310
I still can't believe how much we actually have in common.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,370
Right?

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,770
Plus, we're the dream team.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,570
A yure, a yokai and a yosei.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:40,390
ever since and how we all came together because we wanted to
form an idol group it has to be fate i just know it

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:53,930
do you guys really think we can stop this place from being
demolished it's gonna take a lot of work but if we stick to

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:01,770
the plan i know we can save it right phoebe mm-hmm from my
time as a solo idol i have learned that you can accomplish

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,050
anything with enough determination.

14
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,150
It'll lead into our paychecks for a while, but it's a small
price to pay to bring this place back.

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,930
Don't worry about it, Mint.

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,290
This once-thriving May Cafe in the heart of Akihabara will
live again.

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,390
Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,830
Then let's give it everything we got!

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:21,530
Yeah!

20
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,330
Sunday!

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,190
Tonight's the big night.

22
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,070
You guys ready?

23
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,430
Yep, yep.

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,910
I'm working on closing the cafe right now.

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,190
So nervous.

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,870
Excited nervous!

27
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,890

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,030
I'm so excited!

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:41,930
Good.

30
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,850
Let's make sure to channel all of that into our show.

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,770
Yay!

32
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,380
Running there right now!

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,520
And in recent news, there have been growing concerns over
more missing persons in the Akihabara area.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,380
Four more people have suddenly vanished without a trace.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,600
Officials are advising individuals to remain indoors as much
as possible.

36
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,580
Especially during the evening.

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,450
I'm your blossoming fairy, Phoebe.

38
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,130
Don't lose your head.

39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,850
I'm your yokai princess, Victoria Roman.

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,930
My, my boo!

41
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,990
I'm your hunting ghost maid, Maintant Phantom.

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,150
And together, we are...

43
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,490
Yudai!

44
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,170
Yudai!

45
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:49,930
Yudai!

46
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:51,950
Me?

47
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,890
Be a part of our story!

48
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,210
We are...

49
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,630
EXE!

50
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,870

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,140
are so cooked!
