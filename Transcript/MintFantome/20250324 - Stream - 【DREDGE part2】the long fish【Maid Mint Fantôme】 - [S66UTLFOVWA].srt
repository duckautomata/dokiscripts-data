1
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,900
Ah, ah, ah.

2
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,620
Hello everybody!

3
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,500
Hello, hello, hello.

4
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,860
Hello, hello.

5
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,600
Let me take a sippy.

6
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,660
Thank you for the five gifts.

7
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,200
Hat.

8
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,020
Where's hat?

9
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,080
Sorry, I'm getting adjusted.

10
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,320
Um, hello!

11
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,600
Welcome to... Welcome back?

12
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,740
Maybe it's a dredge.

13
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,900
Swamp goals!

14
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,540
Thank you so much for the five gifts.

15
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,240
Am I okay?

16
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,960
I'm okay.

17
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,100
I'm okay.

18
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,300
Um...

19
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,620
Maybe...

20
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,160
Maybe...

21
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,520
Once a month, there's about a strange...

22
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,540
Flow of spiritual energy that disrupts the ghostly realm.

23
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,470
And, uh...

24
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,990
This time it's particularly...

25
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,530
It's scary this time!

26
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,890
Amazing with Nimi last Friday.

27
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,870
I hope you guys do more collabs in the future, please.

28
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,750
I would love to do more collabs with Nimi.

29
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,090
Nightmare with Nikima!

30
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,890
Thank you!

31
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,930
Glad you liked it.

32
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,830
No, no, it's spiritual energy.

33
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,010
What are you guys talking about?

34
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,390
What are you guys talking about?

35
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,330
Spiritual energy.

36
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,570
Anyway.

37
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,270
But because of that, I'm a little...

38
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,330
I'm a little off today.

39
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,910
A little more lethargic.

40
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,090
A little more...

41
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,870
That.

42
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,090
So...

43
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,150
So...

44
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,830
Where did the BGM go?

45
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,620
Can I give you chocolate?

46
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
You could always...

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,740
You could always...

48
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,880
You could always...

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,160
Offer it as an offering, you know?

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,640
But I was like, I'm feeling a little...

51
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,800
Maybe I just wanna fish.

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
Maybe I just wanna fish a little bit.

53
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,220
When I scrape my knee, I let spiritual energy out and my ghost too.

54
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,960
You have an ectoplasm?

55
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,080
Fishing?

56
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,340
Fishing?

57
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,820
I was fishing.

58
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,860
I was literally me.

59
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,960
If this is your first time watching Dredge today...

60
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,780
There's like a story, but not really.

61
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,480
So there's really just like some quests that we have to do, but mostly we're just kinda fishing.

62
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,220
So you're kinda... There's not really...

63
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,580
Yeah, it's more like a mystery.

64
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,460
Yeah, there's like...

65
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,260
We're fishing and sometimes we get some demonic fish.

66
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,660
That's about it, I think.

67
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,000
Have you seen they're adding friendly ghasts?

68
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,160
Oh my gosh, yes!

69
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,180
Before!

70
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,160
Before I streamed yesterday.

71
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,960
I was watching the Minecraft live.

72
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,760
And so I saw it all happening live.

73
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,860
And I saw... Did you guys see the friendly ghasts?

74
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,580
Oh my gosh, they're so stinking cute.

75
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240
They're so cute!

76
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,240
You go to the nether and you go and you get a little like...

77
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,780
Ghast...

78
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,840
Jerky.

79
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,360
And then you throw the jerky in the water and you rehydrate it.

80
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,300
And then it becomes a little baby ghast.

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,900
And then it grows up to be a big ghast.

82
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,480
And then you're gonna... Oh my gosh.

83
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,240
It's actually...

84
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,520
It's so funny because, you know, I like to put on...

85
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,440
As toxic as it may be, I like to watch the live chats and those sorts of things.

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,260
Because they're so all over the place.

87
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,880
It's such a fascinating thing to watch.

88
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,540
But even with this...

89
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:14,340
Like, usually people just be like, Oh, it's like watching the game awards live chats and everything too.

90
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,280
They'll be like, Oh, when is new Fortnite skin?

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,940
Oh, give us... Give me...

92
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,860
Fortnite, Roblox, Robux...

93
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,420
Whatever.

94
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,900
The eyes of cringe.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,740
Yeah, skip, skip, L, take, L, L.

96
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,220
They love spamming that.

97
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,900
But this time with the ghasts, people were eating it up.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,420
They were like, This is awesome.

99
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,360
This is so awesome.

100
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,680
I get to have waifu ghast.

101
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,700
My dream has come...

102
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,880
Waifu?

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:48,960
Waifu?

104
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,290
Bloodborne PC.

105
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,330
No, GTA 6.

106
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,390
Yeah, it's always those same comments.

107
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,930
You heard them.

108
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,350
The man did not stutter.

109
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,330
But yeah, people were like really into...

110
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,190
The ghast thing.

111
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,890
It's so awesome because you can ride on them.

112
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,290
And it's almost like creative mode.

113
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,030
Where you're like...

114
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,590
That's the reason why so many people use creative mode, right?

115
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,590
Just to be able to like...

116
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,830
Fly and build stuff with ease.

117
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,470
But with this, you can just sit on the ghast and move around as if you're in creative mode.

118
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,590
And like...

119
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,090
Build that way.

120
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,250
It's so awesome.

121
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,990
It's so awesome.

122
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:47,250
It is well known that fish are laden with myriad vitamins and essential oils that aid in the recovery from the sick.

123
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,430
Probably, I think.

124
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,170
Gotta be.

125
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,790
Thank you.

126
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,570
Thanks so much for the super chat, Sk8ly.

127
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:57,890
So...

128
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,850
I'm very excited.

129
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,330
There was one part that was making me laugh.

130
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,510
Because after they announced that, people were like...

131
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,350
Okay, when are we gonna get the update?

132
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,350
Which this I agree upon.

133
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,590
I agree on this because it's like...

134
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,610
People really want an update.

135
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,010
Sorry, this is not Minecraft talk, but...

136
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,390
I forgot to mention it yesterday.

137
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,030
Um...

138
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,640
Um...

139
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,930
People really want an update for the end.

140
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:24,610
Right?

141
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,510
Like...

142
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,110
Because all there is are sometimes the boats and that's it.

143
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,210
There's nothing in the end.

144
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,290
At all.

145
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,420
And so...

146
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,090
People were like...

147
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,970
Hey, can we please get an update for the end?

148
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,330
Can we please get an update for the end?

149
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,490
Please get an update for the end.

150
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,630
And...

151
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,790
There was one comment.

152
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,650
You always can tell when it's like kids in the chat.

153
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,410
It's so funny.

154
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,830
But there was one comment that was just like...

155
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,010
Everyone!

156
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,410
Please spam!

157
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,970
Update the end, please!

158
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,510
Until they hear our cries!

159
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,870
3, 2, 1, go!

160
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,830
I'm like, yeah, that's exactly what...

161
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,810
That kid, it was me.

162
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,050
I wrote that in chat.

163
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:17,930
And...

164
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,850
It's so funny.

165
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,010
They're trying to...

166
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,030
Yeah, they're trying to have a revolution in the chat.

167
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,170
They're just like...

168
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:28,930
Everyone...

169
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,790
Yeah, hot dog!

170
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,210
Feel better being...

171
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:31,810
Thank you!

172
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,030
I saw a clip about you being into robot women.

173
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,830
The YouTube recommended me a video about something called...

174
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,790
Martial Machine Maiden.

175
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,570
Thought I should share in case you haven't heard of it.

176
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,390
I haven't.

177
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,230
Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.

178
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,560
Martial Machine Maiden.

179
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,420
This is so on my alley.

180
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,040
Thank you.

181
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,780
Thank you.

182
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,760
Wait, what is happening?

183
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,780
Everyone!

184
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,860
Please spam!

185
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Mint is cute!

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,320
No!

187
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,620
Black Knight, welcome to membership.

188
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,240
Thank you.

189
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,740
Suckers, those cries only fuel the devs.

190
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,800
Wait, in like, spite or...

191
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Also, Uni, thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

192
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,620
Thank you.

193
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,640
And Jesse, thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

194
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,100
Also, thank you!

195
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,060
I like the idea of vanilla shaders.

196
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,040
Oh yes!

197
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,380
That's another thing they added.

198
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
Kids are cool, Jack.

200
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,540
They added in-game shaders.

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,760
Which is huge too, I think.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,100
Right?

203
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,820
So, sometimes shaders can really lag.

204
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:00,520
And also, if you want to use shaders, if you're so used to shaders, but you want to use the most updated Minecraft...

205
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,650
Big news!

206
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,850
Big Minecraft news.

207
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,690
I also have big news!

208
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,810
Sorry, this is only for Metal Gear people.

209
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,250
I was playing Peace Walker this morning.

210
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,410
And of course this had to happen off stream.

211
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,270
I have some...

212
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,910
I have some...

213
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,650
Did I say...

214
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,790
I said Peace Walker, right?

215
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,970
I was playing Peace Walker this morning.

216
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,790
I have several news.

217
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,190
First...

218
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,490
I got Nemi Nightmare.

219
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,830
I got a tape here.

220
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,650
I got Nemi Nightmare as our first new recruit announcement.

221
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,670
How do you say it?

222
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,090
I got Nemi.

223
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,230
Thanks Nemi, welcome to MSF.

224
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,930
And then, our next announcement.

225
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,070
Announcement.

226
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,030
Leech...

227
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,930
Has joined...

228
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,690
MSF!

229
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,290
That's our guy.

230
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,090
That's Leech right there.

231
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,950
Leech!

232
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,270
Of course I had to get him off stream.

233
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,330
I'm so sad.

234
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:38,270
Sorry, that means a lot to anybody who's been following Metal Gear and Peace Walker and stuff.

235
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,870
For those who want a little bit more context.

236
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,690
I played Metal Gear Solid, Peace Walker before.

237
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,710
And in the game you recruit people, as you can see.

238
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,570
They all have different animal names.

239
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,410
And in the past, I once got a guy named Leech.

240
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,950
And I was like, Leech?

241
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,250
His name is Leech?

242
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,910
And his stats sucked.

243
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,870
And I was like, you are a literal leech upon our base.

244
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,550
What?

245
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,590
Who are you?

246
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,350
And I, you know, of course.

247
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,850
Of course I grew attached to our poor simple Leech.

248
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,410
And then...

249
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,870
And then I sent him off into combat and Leech died on the battlefield.

250
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,610
Boss, can you teach me how to reload?

251
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,310
Yeah, that's what Leech says.

252
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,990
And so, yes.

253
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,470
Now we have Leech back.

254
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,370
Anyway, shall we dredge?

255
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,710
So...

256
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,170
We are back.

257
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,610
Oh my gosh, that's right.

258
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,490
I'm trying to do a research part.

259
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,050
There was one more that I was trying to get, I believe.

260
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,410
You think Leech likes tortilla chips?

261
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,090
Absolutely.

262
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,610
Leech probably is like a vacuum and just...

263
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:14,770
Everything.

264
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,250
You know, just like a leech would.

265
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,330
Silver, welcome to membership.

266
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,070
Masakichi, welcome to membership.

267
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,990
Thank you guys, thank you so much.

268
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,670
Jet engine, yes.

269
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,610
So, this game is a...

270
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,030
As you can see, it's an inventory management fishing simulator.

271
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,170
Right now we are searching for relics.

272
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,010
Such as these.

273
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,530
Which...

274
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,290
We went to Gale Cliffs and I got scared.

275
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,610
Right now we are at...

276
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,330
Somewhere.

277
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,590
Right now we are...

278
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,090
This one is a hard task.

279
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,230
Deliver rotting kangaroo.

280
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,020
Right now we are at Stellar Basin.

281
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,660
Stellar Basin.

282
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,840
I have not been to the Twisted Strand or Devil's Spine yet.

283
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,600
And I'm just noticing that all of these names kind of sound like a Neil Breen movie.

284
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,740
Like Twisted Strand.

285
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,060
Stellar Basin.

286
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,420
What do you and Nemi's girly pop sugar epic couples name be?

287
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,480
Mini Nightome or Ninto Fantmare or Nomptmare Night.

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,680
These are so cursed.

289
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,180
Hashtag eyes on Breen.

290
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,280
Wait, what is eyes on Breen?

291
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,760
What's that?

292
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,780
Get well soon, Johnson.

293
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,440
Thanks, nine.

294
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,700
Faithful fishing.

295
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,690
It's a Red Letter Media reference?

296
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,230
Wait, I know Red Letter Media.

297
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,270
Hashtag eyes on Breen.

298
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,390
I don't remember that though.

299
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,370
Oh gosh.

300
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,550
It's from the Breen Watch Along.

301
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,230
Red Letter Media does a lot of Neil Breen coverage.

302
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,830
Yeah, I know.

303
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,990
I love Red Letter Media.

304
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,410
Mike Stacloss is my oshi.

305
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,370
I was literally watching, what was it?

306
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,250
Oh gosh.

307
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,010
The review of Possession.

308
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,030
I was watching that.

309
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,380
He sure is.

310
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,000
I love Red Letter Media.

311
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,040
Okie dokie.

312
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,580
So we have this X.

313
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,200
Oh sorry, my head is blocking it.

314
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,120
This X here, that is one of the cursed objects we need to get.

315
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,620
But we need C4.

316
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,400
We need something explosive.

317
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
And then there's something in here.

318
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,960
Not quite sure how to get this one yet.

319
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,340
We have not been to Twisted Strand or Devil's Spine yet.

320
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,340
We probably have to go back to the morrows and then...

321
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,340
So that we don't get caught in the...

322
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,320
In the night time.

323
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,720
At night, things get real spooky you guys.

324
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,440
Hi.

325
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:45,880
Hello.

326
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,600
Watch Mini Minto, watching Minto and the Mintoception.

327
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,600
Wait, Mini Minto?

328
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,080
Where?

329
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,540
But I'm trying to collect these research parts.

330
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,140
Oh, I have a message.

331
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,020
I forgot to read this.

332
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,360
Vessel SY Grand Prize.

333
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,520
Oaken Music Box.

334
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,760
Oh, Artifact Manifest.

335
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Is this what he's trying to get?

336
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,140
Purchased from... Oh no, this is what he did get.

337
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,860
Purchased from the Ant Aquarian at Little Morrow for a bargain price.

338
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,480
Previously salvaged from an undisclosed shipwreck.

339
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,500
Has the letter J carved on the other's underside, otherwise in reasonable condition.

340
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,540
Has not been opened for fear of damaging the mechanism.

341
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,700
Pending inspection by locksmith.

342
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,340
One more month.

343
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,360
Wow.

344
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,040
Almost one year.

345
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,020
Wow.

346
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh, the Minto plushie.

347
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,140
Oh, my cursor?

348
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,380
Yeah, my cursor.

349
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,740
I got it finally to work where it doesn't...

350
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,240
I can turn off my computer and it doesn't reset to my normal cursor.

351
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,120
It's forever Minto cursor.

352
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,600
4-4.

353
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,360
Spooky day.

354
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,280
But I actually... I...

355
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,200
I initially graduated on 4-3, so I think I'll celebrate then.

356
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,880
Like a combination.

357
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,740
4-4-4.

358
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,180
It's like a combination.

359
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm back.

360
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,760
Because I also, you know, came back on April 1st.

361
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,600
Hmm.

362
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm still thinking about it.

363
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,440
4-2.

364
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,760
Wooden mask.

365
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,800
Carved wooden tribal mask said to bring good luck, fertility...

366
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,440
You guys can use that.

367
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,720
Good health, fortune, rain and protection from evil spirits.

368
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
You guys can really use this.

369
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,700
Traded for a pair of socks and a pocket watch chain.

370
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,120
12-piece tea set.

371
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,380
Bone china.

372
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,400
Six-time cup.

373
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,140
Six-time saucer.

374
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,000
Acquired from an eastern dealer.

375
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,280
Do not use.

376
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,940
And then a jar containing earth from a meteorite impact site allegedly.

377
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,730
My head is hiding the do not use, but I promise it says that.

378
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,850
Oh, fisherman's note.

379
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,730
When did I get this?

380
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,450
Deep sky, deep sky, deep forever.

381
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,430
Casket, seal, broken fog core.

382
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,090
This is so fog core.

383
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:36,710
Oh my god.

384
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,650
5 equals rise.

385
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,230
He knows.

386
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,340
Okay, spooky.

387
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,880
Alright.

388
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,220
Oh, encyclopedia.

389
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,700
I'm just gonna zoom through these so that we can...

390
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,520
You see, like, I got a lumpy guy.

391
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,060
All seeing caught.

392
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,240
Wisps are fine with fertility.

393
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,960
Plenty of pregnancies already.

394
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,940
Maybe.

395
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,900
I don't know.

396
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,960
Are you sure?

397
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,940
There's so many things in the morrow I still haven't gotten.

398
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,700
The morrows.

399
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,400
The morrows, the morrows.

400
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,740
And I've only discovered not even 20 out of at least 150.

401
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,980
One more to see to be a dredge fishing master is my destiny.

402
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,160
Upside down lumpy.

403
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,180
Thank you so much for the gift.

404
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,100
Thank you.

405
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,500
Okay.

406
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,980
It's a little late.

407
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,380
Hold on.

408
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,460
I'm gonna use this time since I'm close to the dock to kind of...

409
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,020
Oh, wait.

410
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,340
Fish.

411
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,360
We got a savage barracuda!

412
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,720
Alright.

413
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,120
That was so lucky.

414
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,960
Okay, now I'm gonna sleep.

415
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,920
What a savage.

416
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,420
I'm gonna take it.

417
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm gonna...

418
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,240
I'm going to... What's the word?

419
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,140
Take it safe until I get used to the controls again.

420
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,320
Look at that guy!

421
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,000
It thrashes about ruinously.

422
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,340
Ruin... yeah.

423
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,100
Jaw is snapping and tearing its own flesh apart.

424
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,180
A body sundered by ravenous hatred.

425
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,740
Sell my fish before I sleep?

426
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,180
Oh, because they'll...

427
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,680
They'll... yeah.

428
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,280
They'll rot.

429
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,980
I love the sound of rain against the roof of my cabin.

430
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,080
Is there anything better?

431
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,060
I only have this.

432
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,180
But he sells for a pretty penny.

433
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,930
We'll sell it.

434
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,150
Otherwise he'll rot.

435
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,430
I don't think I can sell...

436
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,510
I'm gonna put these in my storage.

437
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,010
We'll sell these later.

438
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,510
My Ouroboros flag.

439
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,670
And my scrap.

440
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,450
Just in case something happens.

441
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,370
What was the floating dock again?

442
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:43,970
Oh, that's right.

443
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:44,830
This is this.

444
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,010
We are trying to get...

445
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,530
No, it's under the upgrades.

446
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,010
So we actually...

447
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,810
I could buy the last research part, you guys!

448
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,010
Should I?

449
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,720
I only have 376 and it's 350.

450
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,400
Do it!

451
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,300
Nah, they're plentiful.

452
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,140
That's how I feel.

453
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,120
But I'm like...

454
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,900
Would I be able to even buy the...

455
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,960
Money is meant to be spent.

456
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,380
Let's sleep.

457
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,060
And we'll think about it when we're on our way back to...

458
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,360
What do you call it?

459
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,540
The morrows, you know?

460
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,900
Good morning, Mito!

461
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,560
Alright.

462
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
It is...

463
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,960
Not this way.

464
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,380
This way?

465
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,300
Which direction?

466
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,520
Oh!

467
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,640
Oh my gosh, follow the lighthouse.

468
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,720
I see it!

469
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,320
I'm kinda bad at turning.

470
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,220
I see some fishy over there.

471
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,400
Something fishy over yonder.

472
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,440
But I should head back.

473
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,390
Oh, Detroit, thank you!

474
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,730
Buy a weekly happiness tax!

475
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,210
What are you talking about?

476
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,130
Thank you though, thank you!

477
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,750
Thank you so much for the Akasupa.

478
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,310
I really appreciate it.

479
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,970
Help me recover from surgery.

480
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,750
Oh my gosh, I hope you're feeling okay.

481
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,450
Is this a dock?

482
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,550
I can't tell.

483
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,970
I'm gonna dredge for...

484
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,010
Oh shoot, that's right.

485
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,250
Awesome.

486
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,550
Oh, we got some broken spectacles.

487
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,310
I shouldn't do too much though if we're trying to get back home.

488
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,540
Okay, we got a water bottle.

489
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,380
What are these minky sounds coming from?

490
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,930
I want to dredge.

491
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,850
That sounds so scary.

492
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,720
Okay, we'll boost.

493
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,080
It's so dark.

494
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,080
It's so peaceful here though, no?

495
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,420
Look, we're already halfway back.

496
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,620
I can fish a little.

497
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,400
Oh, nevermind.

498
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,360
I just noticed the time.

499
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,400
Nevermind.

500
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,140
Let's get home immediately.

501
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,380
Kookaburra.

502
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,320
The bird!

503
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,230
Will I make it?

504
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,150
I sure hope so.

505
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,910
I think so.

506
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,050
Oh, if anything, I can always stop here.

507
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,750
Oh gosh.

508
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,810
Guys, it's gonna get spooky.

509
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,970
It's about to get spooky.

510
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,370
Nah, I can make it.

511
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,670
I can make it.

512
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,850
It's about to get spooky.

513
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,630
Look, look, look, look.

514
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,710
Special fish.

515
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,830
Special fish.

516
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,510
Special fish.

517
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,540
What's that sound?

518
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,460
Freaky.

519
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:06,660
Wait.

520
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,700
The stone skin of this ray is molded around a black crystal shard.

521
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,660
The rock fragments articulate and grind together.

522
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,800
Gross.

523
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,180
We're docking.

524
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,180
Let's see.

525
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,000
Trader, I have some broken glasses.

526
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
And in my storage I have...

527
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:37,900
That's it?

528
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,400
Why were the glasses more expensive than the ring?

529
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,660
Oh wait.

530
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,680
Yeah.

531
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,520
See?

532
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,460
They're his.

533
00:29:59,340 --> 00:29:59,880
Yeah.

534
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,620
He's like, oh my gosh.

535
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,360
These are worth so much because they're mine.

536
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,720
Alrighty.

537
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,740
Trying to decide what we want to do, guys.

538
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,320
We could always go to the Devil's Spine.

539
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,340
Sell the ray.

540
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,740
Oh yeah, yeah, we should.

541
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,860
Do you think... Oh, do you think it's gross now?

542
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,840
It's still fresh!

543
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,560
It's still fresh.

544
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,440
You can see it behind my head.

545
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,420
We'll sell him to the crazy guy here.

546
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,100
I don't think he...

547
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,360
Maybe we shouldn't sell it to him?

548
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,180
I guess we'll see.

549
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,700
Hi buddy.

550
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
Blinding headache today.

551
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,780
Did you come by yesterday?

552
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,520
I don't recall.

553
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,000
Anyway, what can I do for you?

554
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,020
153!

555
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,440
Nice.

556
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,000
Does this...

557
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,300
I don't know if I have this on my ship or not.

558
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,100
No.

559
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,140
It's fine.

560
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:28,740
Anyway.

561
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,400
I thought that was like an aesthetic or like a cosmetic.

562
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:34,960
That's the word.

563
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,320
Okey dokey.

564
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,720
Okey dokey.

565
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,000
Wait, what is it?

566
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,620
Research!

567
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,000
That's what I was thinking of.

568
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,900
Research the engine.

569
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,020
And it's this guy.

570
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,700
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

571
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,660
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

572
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,980
Sorry, I'm remembering everything.

573
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,440
It is a cosmetic for the painter.

574
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,920
We can give it to him later.

575
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,980
Oh, the hull damage!

576
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,980
Excuse me, ma'am.

577
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,360
Thank you.

578
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,880
My money.

579
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,540
We also picked up this message.

580
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,700
September 14th, 1927.

581
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,320
I have not written in a few days.

582
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,520
I have been afflicted with some strange chill which conspires to fog my brain.

583
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,540
I cannot seem to keep warm no matter what I do.

584
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,940
The ink has run for some lines here and they are illegible.

585
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,340
While most of what they hauled up was junk, they eventually came up with a large wooden casket?

586
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,800
A hush came over the crew at such a tantalizing discovery.

587
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,880
I remember the next moments with excruciating clarity.

588
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,340
He pried it open easily.

589
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,600
The buckling boards cracked and groaned with relief as they splintered apart.

590
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,240
Crimson cloth spilled out onto the deck.

591
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,280
The crashing waves rose to fill my ears.

592
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,840
I hear them still.

593
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,080
He stared down into the open casket, then turned to me.

594
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,600
In his eyes I saw the void.

595
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,020
The page has been torn off here.

596
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,340
Dio?

597
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,720
We got a vampire running around too?

598
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,320
This thing is amazing looking, the Shard Ray!

599
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Wait, he's so awesome!

600
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,980
He actually looks like a...

601
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,720
He actually looks kind of like a...

602
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,760
Like a mecha something, you know?

603
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,720
So cool.

604
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,820
I love Metal Gear Ray.

605
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay.

606
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,850
I think what I'm gonna do...

607
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,790
Let's go to Steel Point.

608
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,610
See if we can sleep there yet.

609
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,850
Because if we can...

610
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,790
Then we can like kind of fish around in that area.

611
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,810
Until night.

612
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,690
You know?

613
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,930
Gale Cliffs?

614
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,010
I'm so scared though.

615
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,770
I kind of want to go to each corner first.

616
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,150
Because clearly we're missing some stuff.

617
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,910
Like I need to find something to blow up.

618
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,650
New horrors await us.

619
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,090
Exactly!

620
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,250
Hello!

621
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,390
Ding dong!

622
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,630
And I haven't really been in this little area so much yet.

623
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,370
See?

624
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,210
We can rest.

625
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,630
And we can research and everything.

626
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,270
So we'll just kind of stay around in the Steel Point area.

627
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,930
Until sleep.

628
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,130
We can fish.

629
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,970
And we can grab scraps and things.

630
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,590
I think you're swell.

631
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,850
Thank you!

632
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,510
Really?

633
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,730
You think I'm swell?

634
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,690
Alright.

635
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,010
We got all the scraps there.

636
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,010
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

637
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,630
Thank you!

638
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,470
I saw some fishies over here.

639
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,830
What are you?

640
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,550
What's your fish?

641
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,050
What are you?

642
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,550
Blue mackerel.

643
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,730
Did it say practically worthless?

644
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:51,730
Yes.

645
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,110
We also have this guy, right?

646
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,610
Who lets us know...

647
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:01,870
Oh!

648
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,830
I see.

649
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,850
I haven't caught that yet.

650
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,390
That's fun.

651
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:06,870
What's that over there?

652
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,030
I haven't caught that yet either!

653
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:09,410
Okay.

654
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,190
Good, good, good.

655
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,980
This game is dangerous.

656
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,540
It encouraged me to go swimming in the ocean.

657
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,660
Now I'm covered in jellyfish stink.

658
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,720
Oh no!

659
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,140
Whatever could be the thing to heal your...

660
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,900
Holy moly!

661
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,400
Oh my gosh!

662
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,100
This guy is huge.

663
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:28,640
Wait a second.

664
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,680
I think I messed up.

665
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,800
Wait.

666
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,200
Scrap?

667
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,480
Oh gosh!

668
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,200
He's huge!

669
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,180
Okay.

670
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,260
She doesn't bite, does she?

671
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,340
Okay.

672
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,700
I want to catch the other fish over there too.

673
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,380
She doesn't bite.

674
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:03,940
Shoot!

675
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,060
Look!

676
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,340
That's where we're going next, no?

677
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,040
Yeah.

678
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,200
Devil's spine.

679
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,020
What should we do, guys?

680
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,600
The fish will rot.

681
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,320
But we can still get pennies for them, right?

682
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,200
I would sell, but where?

683
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,920
Builder, please!

684
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,280
Thanks again for helping me move out here.

685
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,020
I've managed to get myself set up now.

686
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,620
I found this while I'm packing.

687
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,360
You should take it.

688
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,180
Engineer's companion.

689
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,240
Oh, we got a new book!

690
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,600
Nice.

691
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,160
Do we ever need to use the dock or store stuff here?

692
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,840
Store?

693
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,460
He'll die in storage too though.

694
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,660
I don't think I can make it back.

695
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,060
I mean, I could just go.

696
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,100
But there's no fridge up there.

697
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,400
Upgrading, alright.

698
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,710
Floor it!

699
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,910
We're gonna risk it for the biscuit, everybody.

700
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,450
Yeah, it's just right here, but it's still scary.

701
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,050
I'm a baby wimp, okay?

702
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,970
Would you please...

703
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,150
Moe moe kyun, my daily multivitamin.

704
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,990
Of course!

705
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,030
One second.

706
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,470
Wait, it was supposed to be...

707
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,350
Oh, there we go.

708
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,430
Brute squid!

709
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:05,930
Nasty.

710
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,250
Alright, we sell.

711
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,530
Oishikunare!

712
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,810
Moe moe kyun!

713
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,790
Now your multivitamin is very delicious.

714
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,990
Right?

715
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,490
I didn't mess it up, right?

716
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,670
Oh baby, we got almost $700!

717
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,510
Tentacle sprout from a glowing core inside a gelatinous sack.

718
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,410
Other cores lay dormant alongside.

719
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,530
Okay.

720
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:50,830
Goodnight!

721
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,310
The spell just tripled the nutrition.

722
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,490
Like I said, I'm gonna be a little bit of a baby until we get a few more upgrades, I think.

723
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,150
There's a DLC that adds an ice biome and a fridge!

724
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,110
That you can visit at any point.

725
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:15,370
I did see that there were DLCs for this game, but honestly...

726
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,110
I'm not gonna lie, the reviews for them were kinda mid.

727
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,610
I was surprised.

728
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,650
I was like, oh, okay.

729
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,990
I guess some people didn't really like them.

730
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,950
Iron rig is good, the others are eh.

731
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,830
Ah, I see.

732
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,410
I'm gonna also...

733
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,130
Sailfish.

734
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,870
Blue mackerel.

735
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,790
Oh, I guess it was also a sailfish.

736
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,660
Ice.

737
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,380
If you like the base game, then they are okay.

738
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,980
I like how comfy this is so much.

739
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,000
I was like, this is kind of a perfect game for like...

740
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,120
You know, midday or for...

741
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,200
Sunday.

742
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,400
Sunday afternoon.

743
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,720
For me at least, it's a Sunday afternoon, so I'm just...

744
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,060
I'm just vibing.

745
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,000
Oh, the DLCs are on sale?

746
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,080
How long has this seemed...

747
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,150
Black fin tuna, that's new.

748
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,400
Okay.

749
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,820
What's over here in this...

750
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,300
Spooky...

751
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,580
Spine world.

752
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,420
Marshy blows.

753
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,540
Woah, it's...

754
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,800
Really orange.

755
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,300
What the...

756
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,340
Oh, this looks...

757
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,180
Okay.

758
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,000
Why is it so orange here?

759
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,980
Oh, it's...

760
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,240
Is that thing moving?

761
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:22,680
No.

762
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,180
Oh, it's...

763
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,920
It's like volcanic here.

764
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,240
Just...

765
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,720
Like the water is glowing.

766
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,640
Hello!

767
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,980
I'm docking here.

768
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,840
A man meets you as you dock.

769
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,680
Bracing himself against the wind and spray.

770
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,340
Rapturous day of fresh disciple carried to me atop the waves.

771
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,180
Come ashore, weak thing, and rest your weary soul.

772
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,400
Alright.

773
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,260
Hey, I'm docking here.

774
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,340
Your arrival is providence from the deep itself.

775
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,680
I have been calling, and now you are the answer.

776
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,260
The rite of purification is almost at hand.

777
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,940
And you are to be my replacement?

778
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,900
What's wrong with your arm, buddy?

779
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,300
Are you turning into a fish?

780
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,820
I'm listening.

781
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,180
Your trial begins immediately.

782
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,720
Tell me, what does your spirit seek?

783
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,530
We can have happiness, sadness, or emptiness.

784
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,470
A cigarette.

785
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,230
Tough choice.

786
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,370
Emptiness?

787
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,410
I was thinking that too.

788
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,930
Yes, a pure vessel.

789
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,250
Only those devoid of morality can ascend past it.

790
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,610
And your flesh, what does it crave?

791
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,950
Salt.

792
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,210
Pain is a trick of the flesh.

793
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,550
Do not surrender to it.

794
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,150
I just landed in Korea!

795
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,710
Watched Mufasa like I promised.

796
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,250
Bye-bye song shouldn't be real.

797
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,530
Half up with dredge.

798
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,490
I'm glad you had a safe flight, ducky.

799
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,910
Bye-bye.

800
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,150
You're gonna make it go bye-bye.

801
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,340
Finally, what does the world deserve?

802
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,240
I'll give the world everything.

803
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,880
In a way, it deserves all that is washed ashore.

804
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,540
Freely given from the deep.

805
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,700
But no more than that.

806
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,500
That's not everything.

807
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,880
The trial is concluded.

808
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,940
You still have much to learn, but that knowledge will be delivered to you in time.

809
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:08,720
Now, your role, as my initiate, is to act as Herald of the Purge.

810
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,920
Just as I was for the one before me.

811
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:20,380
The nearby spires blaze with eternal fire, yet the stone hearths of these three idols lie barren and void.

812
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,260
Are we purging?

813
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:32,280
Retrieve three fathomless flames from the crags behind us and ignite the crucibles.

814
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,680
Visit the shrines of the deep.

815
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,700
I will mark them.

816
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,400
They will offer further guidance.

817
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
And I must provide no more.

818
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,580
Wow, idols.

819
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,600
Which statue do you want to look at?

820
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,500
Oh, we don't have anything to give them, so...

821
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,600
Stone columns.

822
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,320
These stone columns of the temple are carved with ancient pictures and text.

823
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,480
Which carving do you want to look at?

824
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,960
The small creatures?

825
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,140
The carving shows a swarm of small fish surrounding a boat.

826
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,460
The ravenous children.

827
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,040
Alone they are nothing.

828
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,200
Together they summon her.

829
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,500
Okay, so we should watch out for the small children because...

830
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,700
What?

831
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,900
I mean, a female?

832
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,160
A female?

833
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,820
Her?

834
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,540
Beneath these words, somebody has added a crudely scratched note.

835
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,840
Do not let them grip you.

836
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,840
Burn them away.

837
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,280
Okay, the large eyeless beast.

838
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,760
A carving is of a large fish with crossed out eyes.

839
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,200
The unseeing mother.

840
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,080
When the starving cannot eat, she approaches.

841
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,720
Aiken!

842
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,020
Thanks for 11 months!

843
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,380
Beneath these words, somebody has added a crudely scratched note.

844
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,200
Blind, but can hear her children.

845
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,180
Avoid at all costs.

846
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,960
Okay, the bubbling vent.

847
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,060
A breath of salvation.

848
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,000
It burns those that mean harm.

849
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,660
Only the pure remain.

850
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,720
Beneath these words, somebody added a crudely... No, protection.

851
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:12,860
Follow the magma.

852
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,780
Find them.

853
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,960
Seems bad news.

854
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,460
What is it?

855
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,520
Oh, I'm looking for sunken relics, yeah.

856
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,760
Relics, you say?

857
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,580
Perhaps one such as this?

858
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,860
He pulls an antique pocket watch from inside his robe.

859
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,780
Droplets of sea spray crackle and seethe in the air around it.

860
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,940
You are drawn to it too, I see.

861
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,260
It found me during my rite of proving as I scavenge for creatures of power.

862
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,660
Donotimus Primal, welcome to my vision.

863
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,700
Thank you.

864
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,440
It sacked at my spirit when I first recovered it, but I came to appreciate its strange nourishment with time.

865
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,840
As will you.

866
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,540
When the ritual is prepared, it will be yours to carry forth.

867
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,560
Oh, so we have to do the ritual to get the relic.

868
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:07,940
Okay.

869
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,920
Are there any others that share your beliefs?

870
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,020
There are pretenders.

871
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,220
Failures that make a mockery of the deep.

872
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,940
I tried correcting their ways.

873
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,100
But I soon saw that they had lost the path.

874
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,240
I left them to their ceaseless hunger.

875
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,900
A monkey skull?

876
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,540
What are you talking about?

877
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,140
He looks like a fish more than anything.

878
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,820
What's that scroll you're holding?

879
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,080
I found it.

880
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,420
At the end of my other life, it washed ashore, as all great gifts do.

881
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,320
It took some time for me to decipher the runes.

882
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,780
It speaks of an incomprehensible door.

883
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:54,680
And those wretched, twisted fish that swam through, their flesh is the closest thing to a key.

884
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,060
What am I supposed to be doing?

885
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,840
You are to prepare the ritual.

886
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,180
You must light the stone with the three fathomless flames.

887
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,860
Okay, see you.

888
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,920
We can sleep.

889
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,360
Yeah, we'll sleep.

890
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,820
We can probably go... I think I see a light over on the other side.

891
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,610
So I imagine that might be the traveling merchant and we can probably...

892
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,760
My eyes!

893
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,620
Holy moly!

894
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,420
We can probably...

895
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,600
Holy cow.

896
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,040
Buy the research stuff from her.

897
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:39,970
Bolt of cloth.

898
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:40,950
I'll take it.

899
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,500
Hello!

900
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,280
Oh, Alfredo, thank you!

901
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm going to be starting a new job tomorrow, so I thought it would be a good time to thank you for all the amazing streams.

902
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,720
Thank you!

903
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,540
Good luck with your new job!

904
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,780
I tried.

905
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,340
I tried, everybody.

906
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,110
What's that sound?

907
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,600
Beware of the children.

908
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,120
Beware of children.

909
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,100
I'm not ready to be a father.

910
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,060
I'm not ready to be a father.

911
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,120
I'm not ready to be a father.

912
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,100
Are those the children?

913
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,400
Those look like children.

914
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,400
I'm not ready!

915
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,640
I don't want to be a father!

916
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,060
Please!

917
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,440
I'm docking.

918
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:35,860
I'm docking.

919
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,240
I'm docking.

920
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:36,720
Leave me alone.

921
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,860
Charred pontoon.

922
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,060
She's a dead bee.

923
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:54,860
No!

924
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,460
They're not my kids!

925
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,600
Please repair.

926
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,480
Those are bad things.

927
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:09,960
350?

928
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,300
I'm buying it.

929
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,660
I'm buying it!

930
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,780
Wait, can we research here?

931
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,760
Yes we can!

932
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,640
You guys.

933
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,460
Huge.

934
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

935
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,060
Now...

936
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,700
Shipyard.

937
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,190
300 each!

938
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,270
I only have 350.

939
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,250
We got a shot more.

940
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,130
Now you can crash into stuff even faster!

941
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,030
Yeah,

942
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,450
now to afford them.

943
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,010
I'll hold off on it.

944
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:06,330
For now.

945
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,050
Wait, why?

946
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,950
Oh, I guess because I... Wait.

947
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,710
Where did this one come from?

948
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,270
We still have the best light I think that we can get.

949
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,390
Yeah.

950
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:17,990
Okay.

951
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,570
Wait, what is this?

952
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,810
The final state of all living things.

953
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,690
When did I get this?

954
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,720
Oh, a fish rotted.

955
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,330
What fish?

956
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,470
The worthless fish.

957
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,030
We truly was worthless.

958
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,590
Will you buy it?

959
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:55,710
I don't think she will.

960
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,050
Fingerton!

961
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,070
Thanks for the five gifted!

962
00:52:59,250 --> 00:52:59,810
Thank you!

963
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,790
Oh wait, my bad.

964
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,910
Two cloths, one...

965
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,290
Okay, I need some more wood.

966
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,810
We have... Wait, do I have wood in storage or no?

967
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:20,470
I don't think so.

968
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:23,890
Nope.

969
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,530
I'm scared of this area.

970
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,590
I'm leaving.

971
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,450
The little guys aren't gonna find me, right?

972
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:37,690
I'm just gonna fish here.

973
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,150
If we just non-stop fish...

974
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,590
What the heck is this thing?

975
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,470
I like how each area kind of has their own...

976
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:45,990
Whoa!

977
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,850
Kind of got their own little mini-game going on.

978
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,040
I forgot to put that in storage.

979
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,160
I bought some fish from the store that the shopkeeper said you caught for him.

980
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,940
Kind of purple and has a few extra eyes.

981
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,280
But it's pretty tasty.

982
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,320
Thanks again for playing such an awesome game.

983
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,360
Thanks again for playing such an awesome game.

984
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,000
I hope it fills you with lots of nutrients and power.

985
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,940
These guys might be worth a bajillion dollars.

986
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,420
Who knows?

987
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:22,740
Oops.

988
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,140
Oh, we finished our book.

989
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,920
It's quiet.

990
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,140
Too quiet.

991
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,680
It's quiet.

992
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,780
How much are these?

993
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,680
21 each.

994
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,020
Alright, we got 105 dollars.

995
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,640
Storage with you.

996
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,260
I'm feeling like I can't do anything.

997
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,020
I don't know.

998
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,480
I feel like I go to one area and I get scared and I can't do anything.

999
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,860
Time for new engine.

1000
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,280
I think that's what I'm gonna do for now.

1001
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,740
Is this a fish?

1002
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,540
No, I think I should avoid that.

1003
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,100
There's fish over here.

1004
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,840
It's so red here.

1005
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,800
It's hard to see.

1006
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,740
What are you?

1007
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,720
A snake mackerel.

1008
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,040
Yeah, let's just keep farming a little bit.

1009
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,600
So chill.

1010
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,280
So chill.

1011
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,340
It's only 10.

1012
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,960
I see more over there.

1013
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,420
We'll go...

1014
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,480
Where was it?

1015
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,480
There.

1016
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,150
Hopefully we don't run into any children.

1017
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,390
I'm not good with kids.

1018
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,670
Oh no, I don't have the equipment.

1019
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,030
That sucks.

1020
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,030
Let's keep going.

1021
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:56,410
Telescope.

1022
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,370
Yeah, that might be good to use so that we can...

1023
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:01,270
There's more snake mackerel.

1024
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,430
Some rough seas over here, huh?

1025
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:06,270
Snake mackerel.

1026
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,310
I can't see anything.

1027
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,170
I hope you guys don't get seasick.

1028
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,750
Oh, is she gonna blow?

1029
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,990
We'll just get the more snake mackerel, I suppose.

1030
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,020
Where are we anyway?

1031
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,480
We're on a teeny little island.

1032
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,960
A mysterious place.

1033
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,080
Can I dock there?

1034
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,900
I can't tell.

1035
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,580
It's like I'm being drawn to it.

1036
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,240
You see the wind?

1037
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,780
It's like blowing me over there.

1038
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,280
Oh!

1039
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,480
Tattered mackerel.

1040
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,580
A tangle of ribbons.

1041
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,240
What's that sound?

1042
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,460
Anyway...

1043
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,840
Oh, it's gone now.

1044
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:14,410
Interesting.

1045
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:14,450
Interesting.

1046
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,930
Very interesting.

1047
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:19,690
But how does it taste?

1048
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,070
There's an idol there.

1049
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,670
A forgotten idol.

1050
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,130
I wouldn't forget you.

1051
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:32,890
You'd be my oshi.

1052
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,230
Let's head back.

1053
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,590
She graduated.

1054
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,850
Don't say that.

1055
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,950
Don't say that about my oshi.

1056
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,040
I have so many...

1057
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,960
Actually at this point, all the music...

1058
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,900
I have an mp3 player in my car.

1059
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,020
And pretty much every...

1060
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,000
Every group on it now is now a disbanded group.

1061
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,220
Like a graduated idol or a disbanded group or...

1062
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,060
Something.

1063
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,180
It's just how it is.

1064
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,300
I don't think there's a single one on there that's...

1065
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,540
That's not...

1066
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,820
I can afford two now!

1067
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,300
Should I sell one of these?

1068
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,000
I don't think I should sell it.

1069
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,520
I think I should just uninstall it.

1070
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:39,660
No.

1071
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,960
Symptom of getting old.

1072
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,340
Nah, I suppose so.

1073
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,440
You can't sell the peculiar one.

1074
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,760
You can sell the other.

1075
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,540
I see, I see.

1076
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,260
So I'm gonna uninstall you.

1077
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,060
Put you in storage.

1078
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,880
And then...

1079
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,020
We shall...

1080
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:16,800
Shipyard.

1081
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:18,880
Gonna buy two.

1082
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:25,730
Install.

1083
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:31,090
She only has one.

1084
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:32,950
Maybe she'll have another one in the morning.

1085
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:39,830
You're our spooky ghost ship crew captain phantom.

1086
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:42,690
Oh my goodness.

1087
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,050
It's like a fish.

1088
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,990
Art of the silver tongue.

1089
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:48,970
Oh, we got another book.

1090
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:49,730
Thank you.

1091
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:51,990
Perfect.

1092
01:00:59,100 --> 01:00:59,700
Okay.

1093
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,280
How much was the other one?

1094
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,160
18.9.

1095
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,220
Okay, so this is technically faster.

1096
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,660
I have 30 books left.

1097
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,140
That's good.

1098
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,780
Now we...

1099
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,800
Do our book.

1100
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,460
What is this?

1101
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,520
Art of the silver tongue.

1102
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,740
I wonder what it will grant us.

1103
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,400
Oh, we got a message.

1104
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:34,800
I forgot.

1105
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,390
Is he a fish?

1106
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,450
Fish.

1107
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,330
Fish love story.

1108
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,050
Like the statues.

1109
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:08,110
I have a question for anybody if you've played this before.

1110
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,270
Are there multiple endings?

1111
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:14,330
Are there multiple endings of this game?

1112
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:18,070
Yes.

1113
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:23,550
So I guess it just really depends on what we...

1114
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,630
want to get.

1115
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,330
What the hell is that thing?

1116
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,290
Gale Cliffs?

1117
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:29,810
That's not where we're at.

1118
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:38,240
I feel we are in a scary area.

1119
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,060
And I would like to leave.

1120
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,400
Oh wow, we're really fast now.

1121
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:45,940
What's that sound?

1122
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,320
I think we should go.

1123
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,540
Lighthouse?

1124
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,460
I think we should leave.

1125
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,140
Potentially.

1126
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,340
Just the wind.

1127
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,200
Where are we anyway?

1128
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,760
We're heading over to Steel Point.

1129
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,260
Thank you Luna!

1130
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,110
Keeping silly and green.

1131
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:35,970
Thank you!

1132
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:37,930
I'll keep being green.

1133
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:42,310
One thing I do want to do is try and find...

1134
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,730
Okay, so if I imagine...

1135
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,630
I want to find the C4 stuff.

1136
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,270
I keep saying C4.

1137
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,490
I think it's C4?

1138
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,490
I actually don't know what it is.

1139
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,510
But I want to find the stuff that we need...

1140
01:03:59,130 --> 01:03:59,610
to...

1141
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:02,350
to blow stuff up, you know?

1142
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,290
What's that light over there?

1143
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:07,970
What is this?

1144
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,810
I didn't realize I was just heading home.

1145
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:17,490
Probably TNT.

1146
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,370
Consider upgrading your ship capacity first.

1147
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,210
Alright, hold on.

1148
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:23,890
We could do that.

1149
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:27,970
Then I...

1150
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:30,370
Um...

1151
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,570
Want to go see what we need for it.

1152
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:36,190
I do need to find more wood and like supplies and stuff.

1153
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,110
We can do that since I'm just right over here.

1154
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,530
We're right on the coast, so...

1155
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:42,450
There's no biggie.

1156
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,530
There's fish.

1157
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:57,690
Fish.

1158
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:59,510
Big fish.

1159
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,250
What are you?

1160
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,610
I think I've gotten him before.

1161
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:06,910
Yeah, we should upgrade our capacity, huh?

1162
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:14,420
Oh, I'm home!

1163
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,000
Not here.

1164
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,880
It would be under the dry dock, right?

1165
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,140
Net space...

1166
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,760
Engine space...

1167
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,340
Oh my god, we could hold two more engines!

1168
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:43,940
That'd be insane.

1169
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,560
So I need a new hull basically, right?

1170
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,560
Oh my goodness.

1171
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,420
Okay, we're gonna go have to find a lot of supplies.

1172
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,160
We're gonna have to go find a bunch of supplies then.

1173
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,320
Okay, okay.

1174
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,260
I'm gonna rest.

1175
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,960
We'll make it daytime.

1176
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,220
We'll leave.

1177
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,840
I don't... Wait, I didn't have anything, right?

1178
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:11,480
Nope.

1179
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,320
I have nothing to my name.

1180
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,160
I have nothing.

1181
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,220
I am Mint Phantom.

1182
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,260
Um, we'll go to...

1183
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,210
It would be a good place to...

1184
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,160
I guess just...

1185
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,450
Finding little islands and...

1186
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,700
Like, crash...

1187
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,200
Crashed areas, maybe?

1188
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:41,470
I'm gonna head towards the gale...

1189
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,060
Cliffs.

1190
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,820
And maybe over there.

1191
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,740
Wait, what's this?

1192
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,180
Go flounder.

1193
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:00,180
Be quick, past Captain Mint's personal fishing shotgun.

1194
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,610
There might be some stuff over here.

1195
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,450
Unless I have already...

1196
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,190
Gotten it.

1197
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,730
Let's check.

1198
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:16,870
Uh...

1199
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:19,610
There's...

1200
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:21,210
Some sort of material...

1201
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,730
Or not material, but...

1202
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,730
I guess we can...

1203
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,720
What's that over there?

1204
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,160
Have I gone that way?

1205
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,820
Sorry, I'm so all over the place.

1206
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,070
I'm all over the place, you guys.

1207
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,930
There's just so much we could do.

1208
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,630
I just have to make up my mind.

1209
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:53,070
Yeah, I've already scavenged this place before.

1210
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,170
It's called sailing.

1211
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,270
We'll get some more money at least from this.

1212
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,970
We got an old chain.

1213
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,270
Very cool.

1214
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:13,110
Have I been here?

1215
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,780
We'll search around these islands.

1216
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:27,430
There was more on this island, there was.

1217
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:30,550
What is here?

1218
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:31,470
Is

1219
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,500
that...

1220
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,020
The wind, did you see that?

1221
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,660
It's so mysterious.

1222
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:50,820
So mysterious.

1223
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,220
Why was it leading me back over there?

1224
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,140
Spoopy.

1225
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:56,300
Spoopy.

1226
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,320
What is here?

1227
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,100
Hello.

1228
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:11,680
Otacon?

1229
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:15,980
Hello.

1230
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:17,700
What the hell?

1231
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:20,500
Would you step out of the way for a moment?

1232
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,360
You're in my shot.

1233
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:23,780
Move to the side.

1234
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:28,320
A few seconds later, the photographer sighs in exasperation and mutters...

1235
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,040
Oh, sorry.

1236
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:29,980
Sorry, ma'am.

1237
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,620
No, this simply won't do.

1238
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,880
What's the matter?

1239
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,460
The angle of this lens is all wrong.

1240
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,820
I'll never get a close-up shot of anything with this.

1241
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,180
And the others, I fear they were lost overboard.

1242
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,240
She sighs again and looks off to the west.

1243
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,020
I was sailing from Stellar Basin, you see, squeezing...

1244
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,180
Oh.

1245
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,860
Squeezing my bums, is what I thought she was gonna say.

1246
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,200
That's what I've been doing playing this game.

1247
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:04,600
Squeezing my boat through a narrow gap between two islands, and then I crashed into some coral.

1248
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:08,200
I thought I heard something in the water behind me, so I dared not stop.

1249
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:09,680
So if you were to...

1250
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,860
If you were able to retrieve the lenses for me, let me see.

1251
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:17,860
She rummages through what a few belongings survived the trip.

1252
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:22,500
You guys don't squeeze your bum when you're, like, stressed?

1253
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,690
I have a spare camera here that I won't need.

1254
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:32,530
You're welcome to it.

1255
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,110
If you can find those lenses.

1256
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,010
I'll mark on your map where I think I lost them.

1257
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:37,770
Oh, cool!

1258
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:38,790
Okay.

1259
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:40,490
Thanks, lady.

1260
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,890
We're looking for wood.

1261
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:49,970
Here we go.

1262
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:51,970
No!

1263
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:53,010
Whoa,

1264
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,030
this must be worth...

1265
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:58,430
Oh, ouch.

1266
01:10:58,610 --> 01:10:58,750
Ow!

1267
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:59,310
Ow!

1268
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,320
Bag of doubloons!

1269
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,680
Just get actual money.

1270
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,720
I'm gonna look around the rest of this.

1271
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,600
We can sleep here, so we can just kind of...

1272
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,720
Anything else on this island?

1273
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:22,960
Nothing?

1274
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,040
If I have a bag of doubloons...

1275
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,900
Is that not money itself?

1276
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:40,570
Curious.

1277
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,410
Curious!

1278
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,330
Depends.

1279
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,710
There was stuff where the wind was blowing.

1280
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,790
Yeah, we'll head back over there.

1281
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,470
It's old coins.

1282
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,430
We're modern technologists now.

1283
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:03,230
We don't need your old coins.

1284
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:03,410
Coins.

1285
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,770
So it was right over here, no?

1286
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,290
The wind blew.

1287
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:16,790
How do I use the camera?

1288
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:20,930
Oh, I guess we have to probably get the lenses first before we can use...

1289
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:22,430
What was that sound?

1290
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:23,070
Oh!

1291
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,590
Did I not explore here?

1292
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:29,330
Familiar looking hole.

1293
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:32,690
Looking...

1294
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:33,310
Oh, that's right!

1295
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,530
We only... I don't think we explored everything here, no?

1296
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,310
In the cabin...

1297
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,830
I remember looking in the electrical equipment.

1298
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,230
Cupboards, drawers...

1299
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,310
Loose floorboard...

1300
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,350
Electrical equipment, yeah, yeah.

1301
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,430
Go back...

1302
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:52,990
Cargo...

1303
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,330
We've already emptied the cargo.

1304
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:55,710
What?

1305
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:58,450
Why is it still shiny then?

1306
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,550
Why did it still direct me over here?

1307
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,290
Oh, wait.

1308
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,530
You see some red particles floating here?

1309
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,440
What are those red particles?

1310
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:28,150
What are those?

1311
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,170
Can we fish here?

1312
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,770
Disturbed water.

1313
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,290
Oh, I don't have the right equipment.

1314
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:35,970
No!

1315
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,270
Interesting.

1316
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,270
There's this over here.

1317
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,330
Where are we anyway?

1318
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,670
We're like right outside Little Morrow.

1319
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,670
Very, very deep.

1320
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,670
I think I've gotten that.

1321
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:00,010
I need more wood.

1322
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,830
Oh, wait.

1323
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,550
Shiny water?

1324
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,660
And there's some shiny stuff over there too.

1325
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:09,620
We'll grab that also.

1326
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,820
Oh, my bad.

1327
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,780
A host eel.

1328
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,180
Ewww!

1329
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:24,820
Numerous glowing shapes flicker and squirm behind a distended ribcage.

1330
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,200
The rest of the fish is withered and drained.

1331
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,620
Nasty!

1332
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,800
Just a regular gray eel.

1333
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,180
Ooh!

1334
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,560
Trophy eel!

1335
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:39,900
Let's go!

1336
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,760
Alright, let's...

1337
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,900
I'm gonna pack it up.

1338
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:44,780
I'm just gonna...

1339
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,780
I'm gonna go the long way.

1340
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,780
Yippee!

1341
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:55,630
Spooky music.

1342
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,590
What is...

1343
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,430
What the heck was that?

1344
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,190
Oh, the dolphins.

1345
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:05,970
Oh!

1346
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:06,870
Oh, my god.

1347
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:08,830
You were approached by a hooded figure.

1348
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:15,130
Swarthed in dark blue robes, their face is barely visible.

1349
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,070
Fisherman, please help.

1350
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:23,750
You can barely hear their rasping whisper above the wind and waves.

1351
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,210
Fulfill the hunger.

1352
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:29,650
The hooded figure unfurls an old paper scroll.

1353
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,270
They point to a shape shown at the top.

1354
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,770
It appears to be a blue mackerel.

1355
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,680
Oh, I didn't even see it there.

1356
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,440
A blue mackerel, eh?

1357
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,080
That shouldn't be so... hard.

1358
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,480
There might be one right...

1359
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:52,980
There!

1360
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,980
There might be...

1361
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,420
If you went two feet, you'd be able to get your own, buddy.

1362
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:07,630
Oh, they're timed quests.

1363
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:08,170
I see.

1364
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:14,330
Luckily...

1365
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,770
I can get him his fish immediately.

1366
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:22,930
Guys, I don't know...

1367
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,530
I guess we gotta really explore out...

1368
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:26,750
Like, craziness.

1369
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:29,870
Shiny.

1370
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:31,570
Shiny.

1371
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:32,270
Shiny.

1372
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:32,790
I see it.

1373
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:33,610
I see it.

1374
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:35,310
We'll get this guy first, though.

1375
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,470
Fulfill the hunger.

1376
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:47,030
With expert precision, they plunge their hands into the gullet of the fish and tear out the heart.

1377
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,170
They stuff it into their mouth unceremoniously.

1378
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:52,670
More still empty.

1379
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,170
They point to another shape.

1380
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:56,570
This one looks like a tiger mackerel.

1381
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:01,170
Okay, well, I...

1382
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:03,590
No!

1383
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,550
No, it's gone!

1384
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,270
Wait.

1385
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:13,490
Rotten mast.

1386
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:15,810
Look inside.

1387
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:18,270
We got more doubloons.

1388
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,230
We got this.

1389
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:21,650
We got some scrap.

1390
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:23,710
We got this.

1391
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,090
Very nice.

1392
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,110
I think I should go home.

1393
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:31,310
And put these in storage at least.

1394
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:33,590
I need wood, though.

1395
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,390
I need...

1396
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,350
I need wood.

1397
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:41,710
Yeah, we got another research part.

1398
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:42,450
Let's go, baby.

1399
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,490
Will I have to do this guy's quest all over again?

1400
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:50,150
The mackerel, I know, but...

1401
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,050
But...

1402
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:56,250
I'm more afraid of losing my things.

1403
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,790
More stuff to salvage by the fanatic.

1404
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:02,810
Yeah.

1405
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:06,670
Oh, it's not timed anymore.

1406
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,550
Oh, a key can wait.

1407
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,890
Oh, thank goodness.

1408
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:09,170
Okay.

1409
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:10,410
Thank you, guys.

1410
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:14,390
Do I have room for this?

1411
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,930
Do I have room for this?

1412
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,190
I don't think I do.

1413
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,180
Let's go to this side first.

1414
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,740
We'll sell our fish.

1415
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:47,360
And then we'll sell our stuff on the other side.

1416
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,340
Sell the fish.

1417
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,660
90 bucks.

1418
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:55,740
Not bad.

1419
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:56,560
Not bad.

1420
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,380
I'm just gonna put it in storage just in case.

1421
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,480
Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose.

1422
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,780
Especially with my driving.

1423
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,860
I keep getting gross squids.

1424
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:24,260
Yeah.

1425
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,670
The guy survived somehow.

1426
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,550
I guess, yeah.

1427
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,350
Alright, we're at least making some money.

1428
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:45,310
We do need that because we're going to want to buy more engine stuff anyway.

1429
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,870
That was everything, right?

1430
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,730
Seems to be so.

1431
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:56,770
The painter.

1432
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,310
Deliver a flag.

1433
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,270
Let me see your flag.

1434
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:02,750
You want to attach it?

1435
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:03,110
Yes.

1436
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,330
We want the Ouroboros.

1437
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,350
As you wish.

1438
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,070
Okay.

1439
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,500
We need... We desperately need...

1440
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,040
Some...

1441
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,500
We desperately need some...

1442
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,980
Is that wind or a giant seal?

1443
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,660
Some wood.

1444
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,240
Go away, spooky rocks.

1445
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,780
I kind of want to just stay out all night.

1446
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,300
I kind of want to stay out all night.

1447
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,880
Materials are always close to shores.

1448
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:01,840
Eventually.

1449
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:01,980
Eventually.

1450
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,100
If I...

1451
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,960
How do I save my game?

1452
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,080
Would I die?

1453
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,980
If I died, what would I have to redo?

1454
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,460
It saves every time you dock?

1455
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,100
Oh, perfect.

1456
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,880
And we just come back here.

1457
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,920
Let's see if we go...

1458
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,560
The fanatic was over here.

1459
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,780
Oh my goodness, look at all this stuff going on.

1460
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,880
Oh, this is where...

1461
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,080
This must be where the lady said that she crashed her boat.

1462
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,220
Why don't we try that?

1463
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,440
That would be kind of interesting.

1464
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,420
At night.

1465
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,160
Oh wait, how do I turn my light back on?

1466
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,420
There we go.

1467
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,620
It was... Yeah.

1468
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,720
Wait, right there?

1469
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,520
Sorry.

1470
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,740
No, I think it just...

1471
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,860
Excuse you!

1472
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,060
What's that light?

1473
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,500
Excuse you!

1474
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,620
What is over there?

1475
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,160
Oh, it must be the research outpost or something.

1476
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,760
New BGM for it.

1477
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:47,760
Is it this?

1478
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:49,600
No.

1479
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,620
I'm doing it guys.

1480
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,540
I'm being brave.

1481
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,080
And I'm staying out all night.

1482
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,300
Wait, it's 5 AM.

1483
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,400
The sun is rising.

1484
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,680
We did it!

1485
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,520
Oh, it's to the south.

1486
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:04,840
We did it!

1487
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,960
We stayed out all night!

1488
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,300
Oh, that's not good.

1489
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,350
He is right behind me.

1490
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:31,250
Why is the eyeball still up?

1491
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:36,410
Am I still insane?

1492
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:39,830
How much damage did it do?

1493
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:41,830
I lost an engine!

1494
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:42,850
Wait.

1495
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:44,690
When did I get this guy?

1496
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:00,980
The tornado gave me an offering?

1497
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,420
He destroyed my ship and then also...

1498
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,980
The collection of cases have washed up against the shore.

1499
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,220
Some have already split open and lost their contents to the waves.

1500
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,140
Look for valuables.

1501
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,380
We got the photography equipment!

1502
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,220
There might be some wood in here.

1503
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,000
Please, please.

1504
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,680
I'll still get it though.

1505
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,760
Never hurts to have more money money.

1506
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:32,820
A goblet.

1507
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:33,860
It's fun.

1508
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,900
How are you?

1509
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,520
We stayed up all night.

1510
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,140
Guys, oh my gosh.

1511
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:46,980
How do you feel?

1512
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,640
More like...

1513
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,020
Where is all the wood?

1514
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:52,740
Oh, shoot.

1515
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,480
That was my fault.

1516
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:53,740
Sorry.

1517
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:00,310
One gold doubloon.

1518
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:03,470
I feel bonita.

1519
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:08,770
A curious looking chest is half submerged.

1520
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,790
Use the spyglass to look for blood.

1521
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:27,670
You're so right.

1522
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,400
A lot of abyssal stuff.

1523
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,640
Sad.

1524
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,160
Oh, we're not crazy anymore.

1525
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:58,640
I just noticed.

1526
01:25:59,320 --> 01:25:59,740
Let's go.

1527
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,320
We got ourselves half a map.

1528
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:12,200
Did I ever go to the research outpost?

1529
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,660
I don't think I did.

1530
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:21,350
I feel so...

1531
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:26,870
That we haven't found any wood.

1532
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,160
The wind is taking me.

1533
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,360
Over there.

1534
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,980
I see it.

1535
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,800
I'm being pushed by the breeze.

1536
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,220
Why does it feel like it turned to night so quickly?

1537
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:55,830
Hello.

1538
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:57,950
What we got here?

1539
01:26:58,290 --> 01:26:59,410
Some wood, hopefully.

1540
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:00,990
Some boxes.

1541
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:02,710
Look inside.

1542
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:04,930
Thank goodness.

1543
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,610
Oh my gosh.

1544
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:07,110
Wait.

1545
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:08,510
Okay.

1546
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:14,890
We have to...

1547
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:19,690
First of all, is this thing still fresh?

1548
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,250
We gotta go sell stuff.

1549
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:23,510
I'm gonna make a little mark on the map here.

1550
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:25,830
A little place a marker.

1551
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:28,690
Exclamation point.

1552
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:30,150
Come back to wood.

1553
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,050
And we're gonna go sell some things.

1554
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,190
And do some stuff.

1555
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,150
We also need to...

1556
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:39,770
You can rotate.

1557
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:41,650
I know, but...

1558
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:44,790
We also gotta get that lady's stuff back.

1559
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:46,690
Rotate your stuff.

1560
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:47,250
You can take it all.

1561
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:48,970
I'm scared of the night!

1562
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,080
What if we lose it to a tornado?

1563
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:57,220
Tornado!

1564
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,640
I have half an engine, you guys.

1565
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,460
I have to get my engine repaired, please.

1566
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,640
That's why I'm so slow.

1567
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,740
I only have half an engine.

1568
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,280
What was that?

1569
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,240
I'm so, so slow.

1570
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,000
What's all that red over there?

1571
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Did I ignore?

1572
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:40,880
I do not see.

1573
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,680
I do not see.

1574
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:43,480
I do not care.

1575
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:44,920
Alright, repair.

1576
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:45,740
Oh my god.

1577
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:46,820
Why are there eyeballs everywhere?

1578
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:47,500
Oh god.

1579
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,180
I think I'm in trouble.

1580
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:50,040
I think I'm in trouble.

1581
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,340
I think I need to sleep.

1582
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,450
Anyway, fish market.

1583
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:02,750
Yeah, we're gonna sell the fish.

1584
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:07,990
I don't care.

1585
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:09,050
I don't care.

1586
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:09,950
I do not perceive.

1587
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:12,710
Oh, wrong thing, sorry.

1588
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:13,670
Should be hard.

1589
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,720
Wait, it says disabled.

1590
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,160
Can I not fix it?

1591
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,260
Oh, okay.

1592
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:26,580
Oh, my bad.

1593
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,140
For some reason I was thinking that...

1594
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,260
Don't worry about me.

1595
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:37,500
I was thinking that the repair was on board, you know.

1596
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,780
We have one research part.

1597
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:59,030
I haven't unlocked nets yet.

1598
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:02,310
Storage?

1599
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,470
Yeah, you're right.

1600
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:08,910
Store, store, store, store, store.

1601
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:12,450
Sleep.

1602
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:13,050
Wait.

1603
01:30:15,530 --> 01:30:17,630
Well, I'm gonna go take the camera stuff back.

1604
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:19,030
My storage.

1605
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:19,810
Take the camera.

1606
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:21,850
I don't know if she has one there.

1607
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,950
And we'll go sell all that stuff later.

1608
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:59,530
Nobody saw that.

1609
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,090
Nobody saw?

1610
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:06,810
Okay.

1611
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:14,110
There's something here.

1612
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:16,270
I saw it sparkling earlier.

1613
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:17,830
Stone hums quietly.

1614
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:20,550
Sending ripples through the air around it.

1615
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:23,530
Faint shapes dance upon its surface, vanishing before your eyes.

1616
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:25,650
Before your eyes can focus on them.

1617
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,630
The cold stone does not... Oh, a hint.

1618
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,530
The cold stone hates us.

1619
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:33,650
It's fine.

1620
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:33,730
It's fine.

1621
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:37,230
You saw?

1622
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:38,130
No, you didn't.

1623
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:42,810
You probably were sleep dreaming.

1624
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:46,290
Wait, that's what you usually do when you sleep, huh?

1625
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:52,050
You probably just were mistaken a little.

1626
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:56,870
You were sleepwalking.

1627
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:00,410
Okay, let's grab this.

1628
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:03,010
The other part of the map.

1629
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:04,490
Wood!

1630
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:06,650
Oh, sweet wood.

1631
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:11,750
We're gonna go over here.

1632
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:15,710
Welcome to the membership.

1633
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:16,370
Thank you.

1634
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:19,130
There's gotta be some stuff in here, right?

1635
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:22,250
Then we'll go to our photographer friend.

1636
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:26,170
And I'm also gonna wanna go sell some of this stuff probably.

1637
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:29,550
Nice.

1638
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,230
Oh, bag of doubloons.

1639
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:34,010
And wood right here.

1640
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:35,130
This is gonna be wood.

1641
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:38,170
It's scrap.

1642
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:39,950
Do I have room for scrap?

1643
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:40,490
I do.

1644
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,120
Any supply is a good supply.

1645
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,060
Alright, scrap.

1646
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,240
Oh wait, there was more?

1647
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,500
Oh, just more scrap.

1648
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,040
We'll come back.

1649
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:55,120
Lady is right over there, no?

1650
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,340
I wanna get this camera stuff off my hands.

1651
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,120
Panic!

1652
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,500
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

1653
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,000
Thank you.

1654
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:11,960
Thanks for being my Kamiyoshi.

1655
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,560
Thank you for choosing me as your Kamiyoshi.

1656
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,080
Wait a second.

1657
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:19,060
That's not a lady.

1658
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,320
Lady?

1659
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,080
Lady is down here.

1660
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:32,950
Lady.

1661
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:34,210
That's a lady symbol?

1662
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:35,910
She's a green flag.

1663
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:42,470
Um... I could see if there's any...

1664
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:45,490
Oh wait, wait, wait.

1665
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,730
Why aren't you... Why?

1666
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:57,910
I know I'm like 2 feet away from it, but come on.

1667
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:59,230
Scrap!

1668
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:03,570
Wait!

1669
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,250
Oh my god, we found the wood!

1670
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:07,510
7P!

1671
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,770
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

1672
01:34:10,090 --> 01:34:10,670
Thank you.

1673
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:12,310
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1674
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:13,530
Okay.

1675
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:14,510
Alright.

1676
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:16,090
We're back in business, baby.

1677
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:17,930
Let's go to this lady.

1678
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,490
Wood, wood, wood, wood, wood, wood.

1679
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:26,230
Wood, wood, wood, wood, wood, wood, wood, wood, wood, wood.

1680
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:29,430
And it's not even just one piece of wood, it's multiple wood.

1681
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:30,970
Oh, thank goodness.

1682
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:33,030
What's that sound?

1683
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:37,650
I think it's a whale.

1684
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:40,370
Am I going... This is the lady, right?

1685
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:47,920
I'm almost positive.

1686
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,060
Oh no!

1687
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:49,780
The mist!

1688
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:51,880
The insane mist!

1689
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:52,360
Ouch!

1690
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,440
Lady?

1691
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,400
Campsite?

1692
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:09,700
I think I went to the wrong place.

1693
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,940
Next to the dock is a derelict campsite.

1694
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,780
Strange symbols are scratched into the sand.

1695
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,540
Search the campsite.

1696
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:22,940
Extremely rough and worn sheet of fabric is collapsed at the base of some wooden supports.

1697
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,600
There's nothing remarkable about it.

1698
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:27,060
The symbols in the sand?

1699
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:35,880
The symbols span in breadth of the camps, twisting this way and that.

1700
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,020
Some are grouped together in what must be words.

1701
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:42,060
Fresh footprints tread carefully around each symbol.

1702
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,680
The last symbol trails off hurriedly and looks unfinished.

1703
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:46,820
Red.

1704
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,040
I lost the lady.

1705
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:54,640
Where's the lady?

1706
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,700
Inspect the last symbol more...

1707
01:35:58,700 --> 01:35:59,460
The footprints.

1708
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,960
Whoever left the footprints behind was barefoot.

1709
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,500
The prints are large and wide.

1710
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:09,320
Perhaps indicating they were left by a man.

1711
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,480
You don't know much about footprints.

1712
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,620
A glint of metal.

1713
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,720
We got a sapphire ring.

1714
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,480
I'll take it for myself.

1715
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:25,360
I hope nobody attacks me.

1716
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:27,760
Good night.

1717
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,670
Guys, where the hell is this lady?

1718
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:50,950
I think she's more this way.

1719
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,110
All I hear are monkeys.

1720
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:02,010
Oh my god, we were so close to her.

1721
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:06,370
She was right there!

1722
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:09,810
We were right next door.

1723
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:13,370
Is my engine... I lost one, but that's okay.

1724
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:18,570
Wrong address.

1725
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,590
Who... who was that then?

1726
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:26,930
Mysterious.

1727
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:29,030
We'll have to explore that island a little bit more.

1728
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:35,680
Going through a hard time.

1729
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,660
Appreciate the streams.

1730
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,580
I hope everything's okay.

1731
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,340
You have the lenses.

1732
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,640
Oh, I do hope they've not been damaged by the seawater.

1733
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:47,620
She takes the case from you and inspects each lens carefully.

1734
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,320
They seem mostly unharmed.

1735
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:52,160
Nothing that some careful polishing can't remedy at least.

1736
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,080
We got the camera.

1737
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,720
Should allow you to capture some good shots.

1738
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:02,340
If you wanted some advice on locating wildlife to photograph, just say the word.

1739
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:04,800
Mammal.

1740
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,280
Reptiles?

1741
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:06,660
Glad you asked.

1742
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,960
Not many consider reptiles when they think of the ocean.

1743
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,960
Loggerhead turtles are a common sight.

1744
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:16,000
Oh, like the dolphins and whales we've been seeing.

1745
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,880
They can be hard to spot in the water.

1746
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,880
When it comes to larger reptiles...

1747
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:22,920
Crocodiles!

1748
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:28,400
What do we get for taking pictures?

1749
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:34,250
Okay, I can't research anything yet.

1750
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:42,830
Let's...

1751
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:53,670
The wood?

1752
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:56,350
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out...

1753
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:58,450
Um...

1754
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:02,030
I don't have a ton of inventory for wood.

1755
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:04,270
I would have to move some stuff around.

1756
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:07,350
I could fit...

1757
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:14,110
I could fit a couple pieces.

1758
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:14,730
There we go.

1759
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:16,570
Oh, storage!

1760
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:17,010
Thank you.

1761
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,430
Yeah, we'll store it.

1762
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:20,990
We'll store stuff here.

1763
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:34,350
Nevermind, I don't think she has storage.

1764
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,430
She does not have storage.

1765
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:37,170
Sucks.

1766
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:39,310
Did the campsite have storage?

1767
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,150
I don't think so.

1768
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,050
We came from that camp.

1769
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:46,670
Right there or over here?

1770
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,250
Everything looks the same!

1771
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,550
What is you?

1772
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:02,350
Scrap.

1773
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:05,230
Hello!

1774
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:07,130
Hello, hello.

1775
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:08,550
Skibity.

1776
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,830
No skibity.

1777
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,930
Oh no, no.

1778
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:15,790
No, no, no.

1779
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:17,530
No skibity.

1780
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:18,510
What's that over there?

1781
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,030
Is that anything?

1782
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,020
It's another cloak guy.

1783
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,020
Let's see what he's got to say.

1784
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,180
He's yellow.

1785
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:47,500
Hello!

1786
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,960
An answer.

1787
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,800
What is that thing?

1788
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:07,820
Oh, red snapper.

1789
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:13,110
Okay.

1790
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:18,570
Is this a red snapper?

1791
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:19,450
That would be great.

1792
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:23,530
Hell yeah.

1793
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:26,490
These guys are so stinking lazy.

1794
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:30,150
You could just go two feet and you'll find what you need.

1795
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:31,750
You're so hungry.

1796
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:33,470
Use your words.

1797
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:45,370
How long have you been waiting for someone to come deliver to you?

1798
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:47,990
He's like, my Uber Eats always sinks.

1799
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:52,350
Hey guys.

1800
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:55,730
They rip through the throat of the fish and tear out its heart.

1801
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:56,690
Oh, just like the other guy.

1802
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:01,770
It's in their mouth before you have time to process what you just saw.

1803
01:42:02,910 --> 01:42:03,710
Uber Reels.

1804
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:04,830
Could I get a nice cod?

1805
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:06,810
Another.

1806
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:07,730
A sacrifice.

1807
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:11,250
Oh, I've never gotten this guy before.

1808
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:12,490
I've got no abyssal.

1809
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:13,050
Uh-oh.

1810
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:14,650
A fangtooth.

1811
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:17,050
I can't get that yet, mister.

1812
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:18,110
You're gonna have to wait, okay?

1813
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:19,070
Be patient.

1814
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:24,230
Yeah, where's my tip?

1815
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:26,190
Woah, a JW!

1816
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:28,430
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

1817
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,090
Thank you!

1818
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:37,050
It's starting to get dark.

1819
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:39,130
I do need to do some repairs.

1820
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:40,710
Where are we close to?

1821
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:43,190
We're far.

1822
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:45,630
We're kind of everything.

1823
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:50,030
Oh, we can campsite right here.

1824
01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:52,810
I don't think it had a storage though.

1825
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:55,250
Which sucks.

1826
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:02,760
Nope.

1827
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:03,900
I'm just gonna sleep.

1828
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,320
I don't wanna risk it.

1829
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:08,920
There's no biscuit.

1830
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:12,700
Alright.

1831
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:18,820
Back to... We'll go home.

1832
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,530
Love this game.

1833
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:30,790
Thanks for playing Minto.

1834
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:31,510
Thank you!

1835
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,750
Thanks for the superchat!

1836
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:34,610
Thank you so much.

1837
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:36,790
I know, I love this game too.

1838
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:39,690
It's been two hours and it doesn't even feel like it for me.

1839
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:42,530
I've just been... Actually...

1840
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:44,730
That's kind of terrible now that I think about it.

1841
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:47,010
It's been two hours and I've made like zero progress.

1842
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,880
You guys heard that too, right?

1843
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,800
Wait, what's this house right here?

1844
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:44,880
Oh.

1845
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,140
No, just kidding.

1846
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:49,780
That's the spooky manor that has the guy wanting the artifacts in it.

1847
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,860
Sorry, I didn't recognize it from behind.

1848
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:56,760
That was the stomach of the rogue guys because their uber fleets got delayed again.

1849
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,180
What?

1850
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:03,740
No...

1851
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,200
It's just, you know, the wrong season.

1852
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:08,940
Everything, you know...

1853
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,020
Alright, let's sell some stuff.

1854
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:17,880
I just wanted to...

1855
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:23,620
I wanted to make sure I didn't have any fish that rotted or anything.

1856
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:27,400
I didn't forget about the wood.

1857
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:30,260
I did not.

1858
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:33,040
But first I want to...

1859
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:35,800
Sell a few things.

1860
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,020
Oh, trade right here.

1861
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:40,920
Oh, 200 bucks.

1862
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:41,740
Let's go.

1863
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:44,020
We gotta sell and I want to...

1864
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,020
I want to...

1865
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:50,220
Repair.

1866
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,620
So that we are at our full engine capacity, you know.

1867
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,900
This is a mess in here.

1868
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,540
This is just a straight up mess.

1869
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,980
Let's organize a little bit.

1870
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:04,780
Make it nicer.

1871
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:17,130
Okay.

1872
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,300
And this.

1873
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:23,840
Our mysterious map.

1874
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,220
That doesn't connect at all.

1875
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,940
Not even a slight little anything.

1876
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,480
Oh, just kidding.

1877
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:33,560
It connects.

1878
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,740
It does connect.

1879
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,560
Yeah.

1880
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,980
Wait, do we have a map that... Do we have anything on the map that looks like...

1881
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:49,840
It looks like a dog.

1882
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,240
Dog.

1883
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:58,680
Dog.

1884
01:46:58,840 --> 01:46:59,160
Dog.

1885
01:46:59,320 --> 01:46:59,520
Dog.

1886
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:00,860
Dog.

1887
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:02,080
Dog.

1888
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:03,600
Dog.

1889
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:05,140
Dog.

1890
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:05,320
Dog.

1891
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:11,640
We need more evidence.

1892
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:16,920
Alright, sold all my stuff.

1893
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:17,980
Let's go repair.

1894
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:21,980
Let's go get some wood and then... Oh my gosh, we can finally...

1895
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:26,180
Once we... Once we repair... Wait.

1896
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,980
The wood was...

1897
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,380
Actually, let's get the wood first.

1898
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,400
Dog.

1899
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:34,880
Dog.

1900
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:41,630
There's wood in your little marrow?

1901
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:42,010
Where?

1902
01:47:45,730 --> 01:47:47,290
Oh, there's something over there.

1903
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:50,970
Something in the winds.

1904
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:53,170
You see it?

1905
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:57,390
Eel.

1906
01:47:57,710 --> 01:47:58,250
Eel.

1907
01:47:59,490 --> 01:48:00,270
Not wood.

1908
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:00,990
Wood?

1909
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:02,290
Stingray?

1910
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:06,050
Blue mackerel.

1911
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:10,850
Was that...

1912
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:15,210
It was maybe... I don't remember actually.

1913
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:16,630
I should have placed a marker, huh?

1914
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:18,030
I'm a fool.

1915
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:20,810
Wood to the right.

1916
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,600
Thank you so much for the 50 kits.

1917
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:35,260
Thank you.

1918
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:40,160
This is not wood.

1919
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:46,370
You guys tricked me.

1920
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:47,410
I've been deceived.

1921
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:50,750
This is not wood.

1922
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,900
I thought it was wood too though.

1923
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:58,840
I thought it was wood too.

1924
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,320
Not wood.

1925
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,820
Suddenly it's 8 PM.

1926
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,040
Suddenly we need to go home.

1927
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,700
Son of a gun.

1928
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,000
I tried to avoid it.

1929
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:27,260
You have to do nothing all day.

1930
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:31,580
I got two things of cloth and then it became night.

1931
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:41,400
Our repairs are steep, but we must do what we must do.

1932
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:48,580
I can still afford a third...

1933
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,120
A third engine.

1934
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:53,880
Shall we?

1935
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,380
Uninstall.

1936
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,020
Should I sell it?

1937
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,620
The improved one?

1938
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:01,780
How much is it usually?

1939
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,740
It's usually 180.

1940
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:08,120
I can sell it for...

1941
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:11,240
Oh wait, I can sell this weak valve engine too.

1942
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,500
This goes 15.

1943
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,960
No, this goes 18.

1944
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,620
You also need money for the whole upgrade.

1945
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:21,460
Yeah, you're right.

1946
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:24,520
Which was quite a bit actually.

1947
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:27,540
It was quite a hefty sum.

1948
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:41,720
We'll have enough for the engine slot.

1949
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:46,480
I'm gonna... Wait, 270?

1950
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:48,480
It's cheaper here.

1951
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,280
Wasn't it 350 at the other places?

1952
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,560
Guys, we got bamboozled.

1953
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:04,310
Oh, I got the discounted book!

1954
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:05,830
That's right.

1955
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:09,190
That's so right.

1956
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:10,890
Alright, dry dock.

1957
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:13,470
Alright, one wood.

1958
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:16,010
Two scrap.

1959
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:18,270
And storage.

1960
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:19,710
We'll do this for now.

1961
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:24,260
Upgrade.

1962
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:28,480
Alright, now we got two more engine spots.

1963
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:31,820
Which we could also...

1964
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:32,720
We could... Wait.

1965
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:34,660
Oh shoot.

1966
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,600
There's even like this.

1967
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:39,800
Okay, hold on.

1968
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:41,160
It's a cargo.

1969
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:43,880
If I rotate it...

1970
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,580
Oh my gosh!

1971
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:49,620
Install.

1972
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,060
Install it?

1973
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,560
Why won't you install it?

1974
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,320
Oh there it is.

1975
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,120
Oh my gosh!

1976
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,260
Oh, we're gonna be zooming for real now.

1977
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:04,780
With the fish space.

1978
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:08,420
We have to get that to get more space.

1979
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,540
See, if you see here.

1980
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,680
Under the... No, sorry, not the research.

1981
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:13,460
The dry dock.

1982
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:18,200
We'll get the new hole, but we have to get this to be able to get the new hole.

1983
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,160
So we have to get this too.

1984
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:22,980
Which we need more wood.

1985
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,300
And the cloth.

1986
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:38,410
Okay.

1987
01:52:45,150 --> 01:52:46,750
I just noticed that there.

1988
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:50,310
Can I move any of these?

1989
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:52,190
Okay.

1990
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:54,730
I love seeing you and Nimi stream!

1991
01:52:55,090 --> 01:52:56,090
Thank you!

1992
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:58,270
It's amazing that you've never collabed before.

1993
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:01,110
I just like her.

1994
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:06,330
I just like her.

1995
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:07,790
A little bit.

1996
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:12,750
I sold my fish, right?

1997
01:53:13,230 --> 01:53:14,270
Yeah, we got nothing.

1998
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:16,650
How much money do I even have?

1999
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:17,670
60 bucks.

2000
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:19,010
Could be worse.

2001
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:21,990
Alright, rest.

2002
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:26,110
Sorry, we're farming stuff still.

2003
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:28,530
That's okay.

2004
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:30,030
That's how the game goes.

2005
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:33,090
Speed!

2006
01:53:36,670 --> 01:53:37,890
Holy moly.

2007
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:40,950
Isn't this like a big fish?

2008
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:44,760
Nice!

2009
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,760
We got a trophy fish.

2010
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,040
Good luck there, honestly.

2011
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,240
I know we're so fast.

2012
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,200
Wood on the left?

2013
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:00,580
Okay.

2014
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:01,760
Wood on the left?

2015
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:03,520
Of the island?

2016
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:09,700
I was gonna go check out... I'm trying to find where that wood was before.

2017
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:12,140
That we got.

2018
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,400
Look how far we are and it's only 930.

2019
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:18,980
This is great.

2020
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:32,180
One moment, please.

2021
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:39,140
Oh, we are so in desperate need of more storage.

2022
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:40,060
Oh no!

2023
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,020
The pain of big fish.

2024
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:56,920
Drop the shark?

2025
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,660
How much is it worth?

2026
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:04,240
Shark on top, sword on bottom.

2027
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:05,940
Sword does not fit on bottom.

2028
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:07,060
Unless?

2029
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:07,440
No.

2030
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,680
Sword does not fit on bottom.

2031
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,380
I can't move these, you guys.

2032
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:17,920
These are permanent slots.

2033
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:31,970
Upper left slot, upside down.

2034
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:37,110
Shark in the upper left slot?

2035
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:41,050
But this guy can't go down here.

2036
01:55:41,130 --> 01:55:42,090
He has to go up top.

2037
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,440
I guess we gotta...

2038
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:50,860
My trophy fish.

2039
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,240
My trophy fish.

2040
01:55:56,620 --> 01:55:58,200
I literally just said lucky.

2041
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,840
Vertical?

2042
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:05,360
No, you won't fit.

2043
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,720
This guy doesn't fit.

2044
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,960
This is literally impossible.

2045
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:20,420
It hurts.

2046
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,260
We're scrub.

2047
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,580
It has to be like right around here.

2048
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:44,180
Because...

2049
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:48,060
That's where that was.

2050
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,120
We came from over that way and we thought it was like this island or something.

2051
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:55,640
Wasn't there wood?

2052
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:56,700
There was wood somewhere.

2053
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:58,240
That's what we're searching for right now.

2054
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:02,560
It was next to the ring.

2055
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:05,660
Wait, no.

2056
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,140
Where did we go?

2057
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,220
I should have marked it.

2058
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:10,780
Near the ship?

2059
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:11,620
It wasn't!

2060
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,140
I didn't see it on the thing.

2061
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:19,860
I didn't see it on the telescope.

2062
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:27,670
It was?

2063
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:32,370
Let me see.

2064
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:36,030
Oh wait.

2065
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:37,850
There it is.

2066
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:38,210
Thank you.

2067
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:44,350
My eyes deceived me, but you guys led me to salvation.

2068
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:47,590
I shouldn't have doubted.

2069
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:49,850
I shouldn't have doubted you!

2070
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:01,040
Oh wood, oh wood.

2071
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:02,220
You're so beautiful.

2072
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:04,700
And depleted.

2073
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:06,740
So sad.

2074
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:09,980
Time to go home and not lose any of this wood.

2075
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:11,020
Please, please, please.

2076
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:15,340
Please, please, please.

2077
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:16,800
Let's make it home in one piece.

2078
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:20,840
Can I get an item?

2079
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,220
I'm scared of using this in like a... what's it called?

2080
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:32,440
A rock appearing in front of me.

2081
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:34,420
What's that?

2082
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:40,200
Don't say hello.

2083
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:47,530
There's two of them!

2084
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:49,330
That's crazy.

2085
01:58:51,110 --> 01:58:52,210
There's two of them.

2086
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:53,090
They're out patrolling.

2087
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:55,330
You see that?

2088
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:56,630
I should honk.

2089
01:58:56,850 --> 01:58:57,810
I've already honked.

2090
01:58:58,250 --> 01:58:59,350
I know what you're...

2091
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:00,790
I'll do it again though.

2092
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:06,820
I'm too fly.

2093
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:13,220
He actually said hi.

2094
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:25,420
Anyway.

2095
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:34,340
I don't think those are real boats.

2096
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:42,370
I need $125.

2097
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:47,130
Time to make some money.

2098
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,670
Oh wait, a dock?

2099
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:54,390
And I'm gonna sell this bad boy.

2100
01:59:54,430 --> 01:59:54,750
Oh wait!

2101
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:56,050
I have a fish!

2102
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:57,030
What's wrong with me?

2103
01:59:59,370 --> 01:59:59,810
$345!

2104
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:04,790
Sell a total of $2,500 worth of fish.

2105
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:07,750
I have enough money.

2106
02:00:10,230 --> 02:00:11,910
We have four net spaces.

2107
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:15,270
Alright, the hold is a lot of money.

2108
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:17,750
And a lot of stuff.

2109
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:18,350
Let's see.

2110
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:22,750
We need three...

2111
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:27,050
fabrics, two scraps, which we've got.

2112
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:27,770
Lucky, lucky.

2113
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:30,190
And we need two more wood.

2114
02:00:30,530 --> 02:00:32,150
And then the refined metal.

2115
02:00:33,870 --> 02:00:34,430
Alright.

2116
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:36,290
And then obviously money.

2117
02:00:36,290 --> 02:00:40,410
Which I know she... Oh wait, there's the net.

2118
02:00:42,510 --> 02:00:43,390
Catches coastal.

2119
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:44,270
Interesting.

2120
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:47,310
Get a travel net, it's a game changer.

2121
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:47,990
Wait, seriously?

2122
02:00:48,170 --> 02:00:48,550
This thing?

2123
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:51,490
Or the trawl net?

2124
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:52,970
Sorry, I saw travel.

2125
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:55,550
Upgrade the net first.

2126
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:02,520
Wait, but then I...

2127
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,180
Like this?

2128
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,780
Passively catches fish.

2129
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,880
My hydraulic rod was for wood.

2130
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,760
This is for oceanic fish.

2131
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:19,180
So if I just like go out...

2132
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,140
We're just gonna go vibe in the ocean.

2133
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:25,600
It said coastal, right?

2134
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:28,340
Yeah.

2135
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:29,680
Oh.

2136
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:35,480
Select the trawl net ability with E and lower it with...

2137
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:54,940
I think I'm guessing I can just kind of go anywhere, but...

2138
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,840
Fishing at 4 AM.

2139
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,620
4 AM.

2140
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,400
4 AM fishing.

2141
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:05,620
This is when all the really good fishers are out and...

2142
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:07,320
Fishing for stuff.

2143
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,320
This is like the real fish time.

2144
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,200
Real fish hours.

2145
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:13,220
Are you kidding me?

2146
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:18,480
Was this what someone was telling me about earlier that I just completely...

2147
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,380
Completely ignored?

2148
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,460
I apologize.

2149
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:24,100
Well, it's depleted.

2150
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,840
Oh, what did I get?

2151
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:35,100
Maybe.

2152
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,180
It's kind of slow.

2153
02:02:58,190 --> 02:03:00,030
Let's go search for some more wood maybe.

2154
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:03,830
I'm gonna search around the island.

2155
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:10,010
Since I guess that's what you're supposed... That's how you're supposed to play the game probably.

2156
02:03:12,130 --> 02:03:13,050
You know.

2157
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:16,050
No oceanic...

2158
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,830
Hmm...

2159
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:28,710
What are you?

2160
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:30,130
Wait, is this a stone?

2161
02:03:31,230 --> 02:03:32,850
And we touch it and it doesn't do anything?

2162
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:34,330
Place your hand on the stone.

2163
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:36,050
It does not respond to...

2164
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:39,970
How do I become... How do I become worthy of the stones?

2165
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:47,750
Spooky.

2166
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:47,850
Spooky.

2167
02:03:51,570 --> 02:03:52,750
Oh, my bad.

2168
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:57,530
Barbed Eagle.

2169
02:03:58,810 --> 02:03:59,310
Gross.

2170
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:05,620
Troll net went up.

2171
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:06,340
Yeah, I know.

2172
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,260
I have to manually hold it which kind of sucks.

2173
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:14,780
It's 1PM.

2174
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:18,840
How do I collect the fish once I...

2175
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:19,880
Once I have them?

2176
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:23,520
I shouldn't have to hold it?

2177
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,860
Oh, I thought I was holding it.

2178
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:26,620
Just kidding.

2179
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,420
It'll sell automatically.

2180
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:40,020
Is this more... No, this is cloth.

2181
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:42,000
But we still... This is still good.

2182
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:49,580
I do this every time.

2183
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:50,420
Nice.

2184
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:52,560
Bolt of cloth.

2185
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:00,350
What is that?

2186
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,530
That also is something.

2187
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:05,150
Maybe scrap?

2188
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:06,990
We shall return.

2189
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:08,710
Oh, our third fish.

2190
02:05:14,230 --> 02:05:16,110
I like passive fishing.

2191
02:05:16,930 --> 02:05:19,230
It also doesn't waste any more time.

2192
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:21,690
So that's actually pretty huge.

2193
02:05:22,310 --> 02:05:25,150
Like you get fish for money and it doesn't...

2194
02:05:26,530 --> 02:05:30,150
It doesn't like add to you having to...

2195
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:36,770
Spend your time fishing.

2196
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:39,090
Wait, so if I go here...

2197
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:42,930
Sold 4 fish.

2198
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:45,950
Oh yeah, I see net.

2199
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:50,030
I see, I see.

2200
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:52,790
I see, I see, I see.

2201
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:54,430
Alright.

2202
02:05:55,570 --> 02:05:57,430
We need the wood and we need the...

2203
02:05:58,630 --> 02:05:59,430
The thing.

2204
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:00,750
How much money did I get from that?

2205
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:02,150
Oh, 100 dollars I think it was.

2206
02:06:03,850 --> 02:06:04,730
Net profit.

2207
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:17,120
Oh wait, we got another wood.

2208
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:19,540
Add to the wood.

2209
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:27,950
The new hole will be our main goal.

2210
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:30,850
Plus 4 cargo spaces.

2211
02:06:31,790 --> 02:06:33,570
I need it.

2212
02:06:34,370 --> 02:06:36,670
Gosh, we really need to go scavenging, huh?

2213
02:06:37,850 --> 02:06:38,890
Like big time.

2214
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:54,110
Alright.

2215
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:56,890
Where was it that I...

2216
02:06:56,890 --> 02:06:57,550
Oh, over here.

2217
02:06:58,610 --> 02:06:59,890
There was more scrap and such.

2218
02:07:03,810 --> 02:07:04,690
Yeah, baby.

2219
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:09,330
And we're so fast.

2220
02:07:10,150 --> 02:07:11,130
This is awesome.

2221
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:13,210
Oh my gosh, game changer for real.

2222
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:17,650
Now we're gaming.

2223
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:19,130
Now we're playing the game.

2224
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:22,150
Oh wait.

2225
02:07:23,410 --> 02:07:24,590
Old iron chain.

2226
02:07:24,830 --> 02:07:24,990
Ok.

2227
02:07:26,970 --> 02:07:28,030
What are you?

2228
02:07:30,110 --> 02:07:30,930
Oh, scrap.

2229
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:34,470
We'll always need more of that.

2230
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:35,170
We're out of scrap.

2231
02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:35,910
We're out of scrap.

2232
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:37,850
Little scrap.

2233
02:07:38,730 --> 02:07:39,730
More scrap please.

2234
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:47,840
I feel so relaxed you guys.

2235
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:50,260
Wait.

2236
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:57,860
The

2237
02:08:02,110 --> 02:08:03,390
pleading.

2238
02:08:03,690 --> 02:08:04,030
Perfect.

2239
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:11,430
Oh, this is a...

2240
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:21,320
Diaper of the deep.

2241
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:23,740
Ok.

2242
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:26,900
Good stuff.

2243
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:43,710
Did I have any treasures to sell?

2244
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:45,890
Oh, we can go sell the iron thing.

2245
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:47,850
Let's get it out of the way since we're here.

2246
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:49,910
We're chilling in the coastal.

2247
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:52,170
We're just being, you know.

2248
02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:55,970
Buy that please.

2249
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:56,350
Thank you.

2250
02:08:57,190 --> 02:08:58,670
How much was that anyway?

2251
02:08:59,210 --> 02:08:59,690
5 bucks?

2252
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:07,090
Where is another coastal area we can go exploring at?

2253
02:09:09,390 --> 02:09:11,050
I have a question also.

2254
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:13,230
Do the fish in the net, do they...

2255
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:15,230
Do they rot?

2256
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:19,310
Oh, store the scrap.

2257
02:09:19,430 --> 02:09:19,930
You're so right.

2258
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:21,090
Oh, I can store it here.

2259
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:24,990
No?

2260
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:35,470
That's huge!

2261
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:38,010
Is it because they're all like chilling in there?

2262
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:42,190
Scrap, scrap, scrap.

2263
02:09:44,670 --> 02:09:46,830
I'm gonna put this all down here.

2264
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:48,270
Our little treasure map.

2265
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:53,220
Unlimited power.

2266
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:57,000
What else do we have in here?

2267
02:09:57,820 --> 02:09:59,460
We have no books unfortunately.

2268
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:01,160
Catch a fangtooth.

2269
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:02,620
Catch a tiger mackerel.

2270
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:06,060
The conger eel.

2271
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,100
Where was the conger eel at?

2272
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:13,840
Gale cliffs.

2273
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:15,700
Once we're faster...

2274
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:17,560
Okay, once we're doing the...

2275
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:19,820
Once we get the hole, I wanna try and do this one.

2276
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:24,040
Because...

2277
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:28,700
Because...

2278
02:10:28,700 --> 02:10:30,080
Yeah, we got chased away.

2279
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:32,020
Yeah, yeah, there was that really big guy.

2280
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:35,280
Okay, so once we're a little bit faster and stronger and everything...

2281
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,020
I wanna... I want to attempt...

2282
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,820
Is this... This looks like cloth.

2283
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:42,360
Yeah.

2284
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,840
Got one of the Metal Gear OST vinyls.

2285
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:56,740
And my dad was super confused as to why I listened to a video game OST.

2286
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,180
Turns out he still thought games had 8-bit noise soundtrack.

2287
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:03,020
That's so cute!

2288
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:03,100
Cute!

2289
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:12,300
But it's funny because there are people that listen to 8-bit soundtracks, no?

2290
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:15,660
Is this wood?

2291
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:17,720
Scrap.

2292
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:24,590
Oh my goodness, that was so close.

2293
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:25,970
I started to zone out.

2294
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:39,300
We can finagle another one.

2295
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:46,430
We're getting so much supplies.

2296
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:48,490
Why is it so hard to get wood here?

2297
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:51,450
Are boats not made of wood anymore?

2298
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:55,350
What's the issue?

2299
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:56,670
Is that wood right there?

2300
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:59,370
I spoke too soon.

2301
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:08,990
I spoke too soon.

2302
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:15,800
And then once we get a lot of fishy...

2303
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,840
We should probably get... So I'm gonna get the wood.

2304
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:23,620
Then I'm gonna go... I'm gonna get some big fish.

2305
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:25,740
Nice.

2306
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:31,140
We're gonna get some big fish from, like, some big oceanic fish.

2307
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:35,460
And we're gonna sell those.

2308
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:40,180
And we're gonna make a big bunny.

2309
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:41,980
Depleted.

2310
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:42,740
Sad.

2311
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:42,760
Sad.

2312
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:47,140
I wish this was Minecraft.

2313
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:48,420
Right?

2314
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:50,520
We could just get the wood from the trees.

2315
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:53,700
The metal.

2316
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:55,160
Yeah, we need the refined metal.

2317
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,420
Which I know she sells.

2318
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:00,640
I do know she sells it.

2319
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,360
Like the traveling merchant lady.

2320
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:06,700
But also...

2321
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:09,520
Is this, like, oceanic?

2322
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:13,160
Oh, I can't do oceanic anymore!

2323
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:13,800
That's right!

2324
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:15,520
I don't have my...

2325
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:18,660
Okay, we're just gonna passive income, baby.

2326
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:19,760
All the way.

2327
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:25,700
Sometimes when you get older, getting wood isn't as easy as it used to be.

2328
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:26,860
Is it because it's heavy?

2329
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:31,620
I believe in you.

2330
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,500
I believe in you.

2331
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:35,400
Oh, what?

2332
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:36,160
What?

2333
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,880
Is this a... Oh, black grouper.

2334
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,720
She believe.

2335
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,100
Why are you guys saying A-O?

2336
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:01,320
What did I say?

2337
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:02,800
What did I say this time?

2338
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:03,440
I'm scared.

2339
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:04,980
Is it because I said I believed?

2340
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:08,260
Oh, there's so many big rocks.

2341
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:09,600
So many rocks.

2342
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,140
Don't worry about it.

2343
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:22,500
Making a joke.

2344
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:25,540
Funny joke.

2345
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:28,860
168.

2346
02:14:30,380 --> 02:14:31,440
We're so close.

2347
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:32,460
Two hours remaining.

2348
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,980
Oh, until it needs repair, probably.

2349
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:41,800
Okay, congratulations on your wood.

2350
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,560
Thank you!

2351
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:52,920
What are we talking about?

2352
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:55,660
Oh my gosh, I got one so easy.

2353
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:04,720
I'm just gonna fish in here, I'm not gonna lie.

2354
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:08,560
We're just gonna farm for a bit in here.

2355
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:13,100
We'll get as many coastal fish as we can get.

2356
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:16,080
As many fish as we can get.

2357
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:20,360
Wandering merchant.

2358
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:25,120
We also need money to pay for...

2359
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:28,980
I guess we could go.

2360
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:32,580
Like, let's go to the gale area, right?

2361
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:37,740
My net's broken.

2362
02:15:39,770 --> 02:15:40,300
Is it?

2363
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:43,020
It didn't say so.

2364
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:46,480
Will it say that it's broken?

2365
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:49,120
My net's broken.

2366
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:55,980
There it goes.

2367
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:57,660
lol

2368
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:06,180
What?

2369
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:12,400
Oh, that's the deep stuff.

2370
02:16:12,580 --> 02:16:13,960
I can't get... I was like, what's the red?

2371
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:15,140
The red shiny.

2372
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:17,620
Anything shiny attracts me.

2373
02:16:21,250 --> 02:16:23,410
I wish I could get oceanic stuff again.

2374
02:16:23,510 --> 02:16:25,670
I gotta upgrade my stuff immediately.

2375
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:30,150
Research to upgrade a net for it to last longer.

2376
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:31,730
Yes.

2377
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:37,350
Let's see how much this lady's selling the special metal for.

2378
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:53,150
Oh, I forgot to put in the wood.

2379
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:02,630
Shipyard.

2380
02:17:04,530 --> 02:17:08,270
She's selling it for $450.

2381
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:12,770
That means we have to get at least like $1000 to be able to upgrade.

2382
02:17:15,870 --> 02:17:17,930
But we can repair.

2383
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:24,230
Let's repair our net so we can at least make that back.

2384
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:26,490
Yeah, back to the grind everybody.

2385
02:17:26,710 --> 02:17:27,770
Back to the grind.

2386
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:35,050
I only have one research.

2387
02:17:37,950 --> 02:17:39,870
This is such a huge guy, no?

2388
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:43,490
We don't even have the space for those things yet.

2389
02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:44,230
Let's see.

2390
02:17:44,310 --> 02:17:45,790
Oh wait, three days.

2391
02:17:46,070 --> 02:17:47,250
Oh no, that's not the net.

2392
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:47,510
Sorry.

2393
02:17:47,870 --> 02:17:48,930
Two days!

2394
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:51,730
Atomic!

2395
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:53,290
Thank you.

2396
02:17:53,370 --> 02:17:53,890
Welcome to the membership.

2397
02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:55,810
Let's do the net then.

2398
02:17:57,350 --> 02:17:59,110
So it at least lasts us longer.

2399
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:01,610
I feel like I'm picturing why it's long.

2400
02:18:02,710 --> 02:18:03,970
Mangrove and shallow.

2401
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:09,330
Volcanic coastal.

2402
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:11,230
Coastal shallow.

2403
02:18:11,830 --> 02:18:13,810
Why isn't there a one catch all, huh?

2404
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:24,020
Get the pot.

2405
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,220
I always forget to check them though.

2406
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:29,920
Oops, not my storage.

2407
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:31,060
Fish market.

2408
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,080
Oh yeah, fish market.

2409
02:18:37,220 --> 02:18:38,720
These, the crab pots.

2410
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:43,920
There is a DLC.

2411
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:57,160
You can leave them by merchants and sell them right there.

2412
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:02,160
But I don't want to do it here.

2413
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:05,380
I don't know when we'll be back.

2414
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:08,160
Let's check around here real quick.

2415
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:10,600
Oh wait.

2416
02:19:12,380 --> 02:19:12,860
Lower.

2417
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,320
There we go.

2418
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:16,820
Does this count as coastal?

2419
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:17,380
Oh it does.

2420
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:21,360
So we are technically in coastal waters.

2421
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:28,380
But this guy, if we try to get over here, this guy is going to eat our butts.

2422
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:30,220
We know that for sure.

2423
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:35,580
Some scrap.

2424
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:38,520
And then this we need to blow up, no?

2425
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,440
Or is this a stone that we touch?

2426
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:43,340
Oh yeah, strong explosives.

2427
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:47,940
Not my butt.

2428
02:19:48,100 --> 02:19:48,520
He will.

2429
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:49,320
He'll get your butt.

2430
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,020
What is this?

2431
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,240
A resource bar.

2432
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:03,220
I didn't even notice.

2433
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,560
Crazy.

2434
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,320
No damage though.

2435
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:16,780
A freebie.

2436
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:18,340
How did we miss that before?

2437
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:21,920
I was working on this guy.

2438
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:31,880
Is it worth even trying for the other engines?

2439
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:33,480
Serious question.

2440
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:39,420
No, not for a while.

2441
02:20:41,530 --> 02:20:42,820
Hearty crab pot.

2442
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:46,220
Efficient crab pot.

2443
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:52,010
A hearty would be better.

2444
02:20:52,150 --> 02:20:53,630
Oh wait, large crab pot.

2445
02:20:56,170 --> 02:20:57,570
Maybe a new net first.

2446
02:20:59,190 --> 02:21:00,690
We only have one research.

2447
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:12,030
The last engine is better than the jets combined for the same space.

2448
02:21:12,870 --> 02:21:14,750
Yeah, it will take us a while though to get that.

2449
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:17,150
Get the rod.

2450
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:18,450
This one?

2451
02:21:20,730 --> 02:21:22,550
The flexible fishing rod.

2452
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:30,100
But it...

2453
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:40,740
But it...

2454
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:42,120
Coastal shallow.

2455
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:43,800
Oh wait, I can...

2456
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:45,920
It's the same as this one.

2457
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,960
Engines can be ignored until very late game.

2458
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:51,220
Got it, got it, thank you.

2459
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:05,080
I need my oceanic one.

2460
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:10,460
Oh, the fishing speed is more.

2461
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:13,060
The fishing speed is so much more.

2462
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:16,480
I can't afford it though, unfortunately.

2463
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:20,900
Hi Minto.

2464
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:21,600
Hello!

2465
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:23,720
Thanks for 11 months cryocyte.

2466
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:27,900
You can use both rods?

2467
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:28,540
You can!

2468
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:30,900
I was thinking if I moved it over.

2469
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:35,700
Sell the old ones.

2470
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:38,000
True, you can sell this.

2471
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:42,860
And...

2472
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:45,480
We can sell this.

2473
02:22:46,820 --> 02:22:48,540
Our weighted line.

2474
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:52,160
And this, our basic.

2475
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:56,580
Now we can buy it.

2476
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:58,660
Oceanic!

2477
02:23:06,430 --> 02:23:08,430
Oh yeah, I wasn't gonna sell.

2478
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:10,570
I wasn't gonna sell this one.

2479
02:23:11,790 --> 02:23:12,810
But thank you.

2480
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:16,090
Buy the metal first.

2481
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:17,210
I'm thinking...

2482
02:23:19,730 --> 02:23:20,990
Even if we bought it.

2483
02:23:21,430 --> 02:23:22,910
I would have to save up so much more.

2484
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:25,990
Which is worth more.

2485
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:41,140
Organize a little bit.

2486
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:42,520
I want all my nets together.

2487
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,800
Or my engines together and my nets together.

2488
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:51,560
Fishing is more immediate.

2489
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:52,620
Yeah, exactly.

2490
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:54,520
Full upgrade is huge.

2491
02:23:55,360 --> 02:23:57,000
That's true, that is true.

2492
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:59,420
Most of the DLC complaints are just that they're short.

2493
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:01,460
Which they are, but that doesn't mean they're not good.

2494
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:02,540
The new gear is good.

2495
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:04,540
I see, thank you for clarifying.

2496
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:06,860
Alright, you guys convinced me.

2497
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,640
You guys convinced me.

2498
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:13,360
Not the research.

2499
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:14,820
Oh, we can't even do it here.

2500
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:16,600
Yes we can.

2501
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,000
It's under...

2502
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,360
Floating dock, there we go.

2503
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:28,360
Now I need 500 bucks.

2504
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:43,200
Better start fishing.

2505
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:46,600
I know, I'll start fishing.

2506
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:53,700
What are you saying short things?

2507
02:24:53,740 --> 02:24:54,720
What are we talking about, huh?

2508
02:24:57,660 --> 02:24:59,100
Alright, let's get to fishing.

2509
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:05,060
The music is so cool.

2510
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:10,640
I'm just gonna grab everything, you know.

2511
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:15,640
I'm just gonna start fishing for everything.

2512
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:18,140
We're right here, so we can just...

2513
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:19,480
Fish, sleep.

2514
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:22,240
Fish, this is the real fisherman life.

2515
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,360
We fish, we sleep.

2516
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:26,940
Oh, I got a flayed mackerel.

2517
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:30,060
Wishing I was fishing.

2518
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:32,100
You are right now with me.

2519
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:34,160
We're fishing together.

2520
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:34,260
Together.

2521
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:38,560
Everything I do in game, I credit to us.

2522
02:25:39,660 --> 02:25:42,180
Everything I do in game, I credit to us.

2523
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:45,520
Holy mackerel.

2524
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:50,060
We're fishing right now.

2525
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:54,980
What is this?

2526
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:56,080
Oh, this is this one.

2527
02:25:57,560 --> 02:25:59,280
Look at this tiny little guy.

2528
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:00,900
Oh, he's a perch.

2529
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:02,370
He's so small.

2530
02:26:09,270 --> 02:26:12,190
You know, I never went around the other side of this.

2531
02:26:12,370 --> 02:26:13,630
It's only one.

2532
02:26:14,790 --> 02:26:17,590
Let's go searching around this island a little bit.

2533
02:26:18,910 --> 02:26:20,310
Okay, it's already two.

2534
02:26:22,350 --> 02:26:23,330
Shiny rock?

2535
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:25,030
Shiny rock.

2536
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:40,390
What's that?

2537
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:41,030
Oh.

2538
02:26:44,810 --> 02:26:45,210
Gold.

2539
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:51,930
I need to get out of here.

2540
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:01,740
It's starting to turn night.

2541
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:02,800
Can I dock here?

2542
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:03,480
I wish.

2543
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:10,580
I think he left me alone.

2544
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:12,080
Dang it, I wanted to get the gold.

2545
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:15,280
What's the best way through?

2546
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:17,000
Um...

2547
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:19,020
You can dock.

2548
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:19,680
Oh, I can!

2549
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:20,820
Oh my gosh, it just showed up!

2550
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:22,880
Oh my gosh!

2551
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:23,820
A campsite.

2552
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:26,740
You stand in the center of a campsite.

2553
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:31,160
The fire's embers are cool, but ash is still steadily blowing out with the wind.

2554
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:34,460
Check the tent.

2555
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:37,180
The tent is a sheet of cloth suspended over some sticks.

2556
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:41,600
There is nothing inside, save for a smooth hollow in the dirt where someone slept.

2557
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:43,300
What do you want to do?

2558
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:44,980
Footprints?

2559
02:27:45,380 --> 02:27:49,160
There's no footprints, but unfamiliar symbols have been sketched in the dust nearby.

2560
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:51,820
Some have been erased with the hasty sweep of a foot.

2561
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:54,740
Why is the music so ominous?

2562
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:56,660
Campfire.

2563
02:27:56,900 --> 02:28:01,720
Large flat rock sits atop the charred wood of the campfire.

2564
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:04,580
A handful of tiny fish bones can be seen poking out of the ashes.

2565
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:05,340
Kick the ashes!

2566
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:09,060
Huge!

2567
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:09,300
Huge!

2568
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:14,580
Okay, I like that.

2569
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:29,620
I'm thinking this one.

2570
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:35,440
I'm more in coastal and shallow at the moment than I am in mangrove and volcanic, no?

2571
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:40,800
If you sleep, you lose the cargo ship.

2572
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:42,060
What?

2573
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:44,040
Wait, what do you mean?

2574
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:52,540
Yeah?

2575
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:54,860
The fish will rot.

2576
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:56,620
Oh wait, my cargo fish.

2577
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:57,460
Oh, you're right!

2578
02:28:58,040 --> 02:28:59,020
You're right, you're right.

2579
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:00,720
Okay, you're right, you're right.

2580
02:29:00,980 --> 02:29:01,400
They rot.

2581
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:03,540
I forgot that I actually fished.

2582
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:06,920
I forgot that I fished.

2583
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:09,820
Okay, we'll just turn around and we'll go back.

2584
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:13,200
I think I might save up for this thing though.

2585
02:29:15,580 --> 02:29:17,600
I think passive income is a good thing.

2586
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:20,620
Alright.

2587
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:25,100
Let's go.

2588
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,480
Just go fast!

2589
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:35,980
The fastest boat that ever could!

2590
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:47,380
I don't know how to get inside here.

2591
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:53,460
Is there like a little inlet somewhere?

2592
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:57,940
I see it on the map but I don't know where it is and it's too foggy for me to see anything.

2593
02:30:14,050 --> 02:30:15,230
Hug the coast.

2594
02:30:15,690 --> 02:30:16,310
We made it!

2595
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:18,550
Well, don't count the chickens.

2596
02:30:28,070 --> 02:30:30,010
I sell all my stuff.

2597
02:30:31,630 --> 02:30:32,510
138 dollars.

2598
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:35,010
What did we get in here?

2599
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:40,810
That thing is horrible.

2600
02:30:44,390 --> 02:30:46,190
Eyeless and mindless.

2601
02:30:46,930 --> 02:30:49,090
Driven only by a desire to consume.

2602
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:52,310
A purpose satiated many times over.

2603
02:30:52,570 --> 02:30:53,630
Holy teeth.

2604
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:58,970
Rend in flesh and muscle and bone exposed.

2605
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:02,570
This gory mess of a fish can't have lived like this for long.

2606
02:31:04,630 --> 02:31:05,190
Anyway.

2607
02:31:05,850 --> 02:31:06,910
Holy cow.

2608
02:31:07,950 --> 02:31:08,510
Consume!

2609
02:31:14,290 --> 02:31:16,330
Only sells for 18 bucks.

2610
02:31:16,470 --> 02:31:18,750
Gosh, if only we could get...

2611
02:31:19,330 --> 02:31:20,110
What was it?

2612
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:23,030
That big...

2613
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:25,870
The big messed up fish.

2614
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:27,250
The big mutated fish.

2615
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:29,010
It was a swordfish, no?

2616
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:29,630
I think.

2617
02:31:30,430 --> 02:31:31,470
That I caught earlier.

2618
02:31:31,610 --> 02:31:32,310
He was crazy.

2619
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:41,180
Let's check around this area now.

2620
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:46,170
What are you?

2621
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:52,950
Oh, I can't get it.

2622
02:31:53,130 --> 02:31:53,510
Dang it.

2623
02:31:56,930 --> 02:31:58,810
Is this technically oceanic?

2624
02:32:01,330 --> 02:32:01,930
Huge!

2625
02:32:08,050 --> 02:32:08,650
Nice.

2626
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:14,080
Huge for me at least.

2627
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:18,000
Always need more wood.

2628
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:25,760
Depleted.

2629
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:28,560
Huge wood.

2630
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:30,240
No!

2631
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:34,220
That's some scrub.

2632
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:45,220
Wait.

2633
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:48,020
I was going to get my camera.

2634
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:54,970
Is this like a...

2635
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:55,350
Yeah.

2636
02:32:55,930 --> 02:32:57,070
What we got here?

2637
02:32:59,510 --> 02:33:00,890
I want to take a picture!

2638
02:33:04,810 --> 02:33:07,010
That looks expensive.

2639
02:33:07,710 --> 02:33:08,310
No!

2640
02:33:08,430 --> 02:33:08,950
Don't come back!

2641
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:10,330
Come back!

2642
02:33:10,890 --> 02:33:10,890
Come back!

2643
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:12,210
Come back!

2644
02:33:12,830 --> 02:33:13,370
Come back!

2645
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:14,770
Come back!

2646
02:33:15,450 --> 02:33:15,870
Come back!

2647
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:17,910
Come back!

2648
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:33,660
We'll get them next time boys.

2649
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:39,210
For now, I'm going to circle.

2650
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:43,050
I wish I could catch that giant fish that chases after us.

2651
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:46,410
I could zoom past him.

2652
02:33:47,930 --> 02:33:51,170
And like, just attempt to do, you know...

2653
02:33:51,170 --> 02:33:52,570
Trying to get more fish by the way.

2654
02:33:54,330 --> 02:33:55,270
What's that sound?

2655
02:33:58,650 --> 02:34:00,650
I think it's a...

2656
02:34:00,650 --> 02:34:00,930
Yeah.

2657
02:34:03,210 --> 02:34:03,810
Yeah.

2658
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:12,480
We need a bigger boat.

2659
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:13,720
Soon.

2660
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:14,840
We're so close.

2661
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:17,820
I just got to sell like 5 more fish.

2662
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:22,720
500 more fish.

2663
02:34:24,620 --> 02:34:25,860
We're so close.

2664
02:34:35,450 --> 02:34:37,230
Dang, my storage is filling up.

2665
02:34:38,590 --> 02:34:41,230
If we go to the floating dock...

2666
02:34:41,870 --> 02:34:44,150
I wish I could start putting stuff in these, you know.

2667
02:34:44,850 --> 02:34:46,570
But not quite yet.

2668
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:47,950
Not quite yet.

2669
02:34:53,610 --> 02:34:54,330
Indeed.

2670
02:34:56,350 --> 02:34:58,610
Oh, I got to buy the improved one though.

2671
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:02,830
How much was this?

2672
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:04,150
225!

2673
02:35:05,810 --> 02:35:08,910
I got to buy the new net.

2674
02:35:12,130 --> 02:35:13,530
10 per day.

2675
02:35:13,970 --> 02:35:15,010
8 per day.

2676
02:35:17,670 --> 02:35:18,150
Oh...

2677
02:35:20,290 --> 02:35:22,110
Troll nets break down real fast.

2678
02:35:22,170 --> 02:35:22,890
Yeah, they do.

2679
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:27,270
I think though...

2680
02:35:27,270 --> 02:35:28,430
Wait, how much was it?

2681
02:35:32,730 --> 02:35:33,210
270.

2682
02:35:34,990 --> 02:35:38,670
I think though it's still better for me to save up for the big boat.

2683
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:40,690
Not gonna lie.

2684
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:48,060
Repair before selling.

2685
02:35:48,140 --> 02:35:49,200
You'll save money that way.

2686
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:55,080
I was wondering if selling it when it's repaired would bring up its value.

2687
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:04,930
I'm gonna go back around like I did before.

2688
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,820
I like the music so much.

2689
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,820
It's so like...

2690
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:14,820
Sometimes it feels very like...

2691
02:36:16,180 --> 02:36:17,080
What's it called?

2692
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:23,360
Like this feels like the soundtrack of like an Indiana Jones film.

2693
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:27,920
Wait, I don't want to dredge right now.

2694
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:29,780
I don't want to fish right now.

2695
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:39,000
Sets the mood.

2696
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:40,320
It does.

2697
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:40,900
So cool.

2698
02:36:43,740 --> 02:36:45,500
You think that guy is gonna come after me?

2699
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:46,540
What is this?

2700
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:54,970
A pirate flag!

2701
02:36:57,630 --> 02:36:58,870
I like that.

2702
02:37:04,330 --> 02:37:06,110
He's somewhere in there.

2703
02:37:06,170 --> 02:37:07,710
He's somewhere in there.

2704
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:09,850
A pirate flag!

2705
02:37:11,210 --> 02:37:11,950
Let's go.

2706
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:16,290
Can't tell if this is oceanic fish or not.

2707
02:37:16,690 --> 02:37:18,350
Right now we'll just get some...

2708
02:37:25,030 --> 02:37:25,710
Okay.

2709
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:29,190
Oh wait, that one doesn't sell for very much I remember.

2710
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:30,810
That's okay though.

2711
02:37:32,950 --> 02:37:35,490
I'm collecting stuff to sell.

2712
02:37:35,490 --> 02:37:39,150
We could always go back to...oh this is paper.

2713
02:37:41,110 --> 02:37:42,790
Afternoon Minky just got back from Japan.

2714
02:37:50,270 --> 02:37:52,010
This is some scrap.

2715
02:37:52,330 --> 02:37:53,770
There's a lot of supplies around here.

2716
02:37:54,410 --> 02:37:57,670
Going in here, I might get attacked by the guy.

2717
02:37:58,530 --> 02:37:59,870
There's something shining.

2718
02:38:07,090 --> 02:38:10,090
What was the...oh they wanted that eel.

2719
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:15,810
They wanted me to find the eel in here.

2720
02:38:16,250 --> 02:38:19,690
What the hell is that?

2721
02:38:23,790 --> 02:38:27,910
Which I know resides inside...in here.

2722
02:38:29,170 --> 02:38:30,410
The conger eel.

2723
02:38:30,530 --> 02:38:31,450
Oh they're night fishes.

2724
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:32,610
Is that what they were?

2725
02:38:48,330 --> 02:38:49,510
They're night fishes.

2726
02:38:51,550 --> 02:38:52,950
Yeah, they want them rotten.

2727
02:38:53,430 --> 02:38:54,190
Which we can do.

2728
02:38:57,810 --> 02:38:58,770
I'm scared.

2729
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:02,710
I'm scared to get it.

2730
02:39:05,410 --> 02:39:07,910
Especially with that big ol' fish riding around.

2731
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:11,250
Could I catch him in the net?

2732
02:39:11,330 --> 02:39:12,230
Or no, it's not possible.

2733
02:39:18,570 --> 02:39:19,990
Almost a year of mint.

2734
02:39:20,090 --> 02:39:21,050
Thank you Rodrigo!

2735
02:39:21,810 --> 02:39:23,270
I can't.

2736
02:39:23,310 --> 02:39:24,330
Do it when you upgrade.

2737
02:39:24,910 --> 02:39:25,470
Oh maybe.

2738
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:26,890
So true.

2739
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:36,240
Oh my gosh.

2740
02:39:36,700 --> 02:39:36,920
Wow.

2741
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:41,780
Okay, that was targeted for sure.

2742
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:48,220
Research part.

2743
02:39:55,770 --> 02:39:56,510
Nice.

2744
02:39:57,410 --> 02:39:58,150
Go home.

2745
02:40:00,910 --> 02:40:02,650
Rodrigo, thank you for the 20.

2746
02:40:03,650 --> 02:40:04,390
Gifted.

2747
02:40:04,570 --> 02:40:06,870
Is that where I deposit some fish?

2748
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:10,550
Thank you so much Rodrigo.

2749
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:11,390
I'm scared.

2750
02:40:29,660 --> 02:40:30,700
Oh my gosh.

2751
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:31,940
I'm kinda far.

2752
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:33,580
Just kidding.

2753
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:42,920
No!

2754
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:54,920
Alright, we're gonna try and get some eel.

2755
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,460
We're gonna try and get some eel.

2756
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:08,580
Sell all fish.

2757
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:09,680
We've made nothing.

2758
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:09,760
Good.

2759
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:13,840
Alright.

2760
02:41:15,620 --> 02:41:18,420
Someone said I don't have to go actually inside.

2761
02:41:19,220 --> 02:41:19,720
But I could.

2762
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:20,160
Is it?

2763
02:41:22,380 --> 02:41:27,160
I wonder though if it's like a... I guess it wouldn't be an oceanic.

2764
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:33,200
Eel cliffs.

2765
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:38,210
This guy maybe?

2766
02:41:38,210 --> 02:41:38,370
Wait.

2767
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:41,510
It's coastal.

2768
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:49,440
Wait.

2769
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:50,660
Eel cliffs.

2770
02:41:52,820 --> 02:41:54,560
I'm guessing it must be that one.

2771
02:41:56,320 --> 02:41:57,300
It's shallow.

2772
02:41:58,380 --> 02:41:59,620
Okay, shallow.

2773
02:42:02,140 --> 02:42:03,940
Look around the island, not inside.

2774
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:04,360
Okay.

2775
02:42:04,460 --> 02:42:09,420
I think we can be able to do it.

2776
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,120
Can he fit?

2777
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:15,920
Wait, that's an even bigger question.

2778
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:19,180
What?

2779
02:42:19,420 --> 02:42:20,980
He needs...

2780
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:22,720
4x4.

2781
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:28,840
I feel like he can... Oh, my neck can't do it because he's shallow.

2782
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:29,320
That's right.

2783
02:42:36,220 --> 02:42:37,900
Wait, I said 4x4?

2784
02:42:39,640 --> 02:42:40,120
2x4.

2785
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:41,020
Oh my goodness.

2786
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:42,600
I was about to say he's thick.

2787
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:47,380
Damn.

2788
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:49,580
No one will fit in there.

2789
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:57,700
Okay, he'll definitely fit.

2790
02:42:57,840 --> 02:42:59,460
Okay, let's go try and find one.

2791
02:43:02,320 --> 02:43:03,980
Hey, go away.

2792
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:05,640
Shallow land.

2793
02:43:06,220 --> 02:43:09,020
Is this shallow?

2794
02:43:11,560 --> 02:43:12,260
Coastal.

2795
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:16,180
What would be?

2796
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:20,740
What's that over there?

2797
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:22,120
Is that a house?

2798
02:43:22,820 --> 02:43:23,920
Was that always there?

2799
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:31,460
Shallow.

2800
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:36,320
Telescope really helps.

2801
02:43:41,790 --> 02:43:42,950
Go away.

2802
02:43:44,990 --> 02:43:46,150
I'm running into stuff.

2803
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:53,650
Over here!

2804
02:43:57,460 --> 02:43:58,940
That is a huge rock.

2805
02:44:02,190 --> 02:44:02,900
Oh my gosh.

2806
02:44:04,160 --> 02:44:06,420
And he's prized!

2807
02:44:07,100 --> 02:44:08,900
I got a prize eel!

2808
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:13,820
Okay, can I catch another one?

2809
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:17,520
I don't think so.

2810
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:17,820
Oh wait.

2811
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:20,080
Oops, my bad.

2812
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:23,460
Just in case I mess up.

2813
02:44:26,220 --> 02:44:26,820
Alright.

2814
02:44:28,460 --> 02:44:33,420
Thank you for whoever told me that I don't have to...wait.

2815
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:38,960
That I don't have to go inside.

2816
02:44:40,460 --> 02:44:41,920
You saved my butt.

2817
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,540
I was too afraid to do it.

2818
02:44:45,020 --> 02:44:46,080
No, don't do that.

2819
02:44:46,760 --> 02:44:47,160
Please.

2820
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:49,500
Don't do that.

2821
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:51,940
Don't do that.

2822
02:44:52,340 --> 02:44:53,100
Don't do that.

2823
02:44:54,580 --> 02:44:55,440
You're scaring me.

2824
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:59,260
My sanity is going insane right now.

2825
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:00,980
If I go too insane will I die?

2826
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:07,520
Go to sleep.

2827
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:16,670
I took the quickest nap ever.

2828
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:19,470
But now are my eels rotten.

2829
02:45:21,870 --> 02:45:22,750
No.

2830
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:28,860
I could sell this one.

2831
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:34,360
She doesn't care if it's prized or not.

2832
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:38,580
It's not that much of a...

2833
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:40,660
Sell the good one?

2834
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:41,020
Yeah.

2835
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:11,940
I misread the command.

2836
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:21,600
I misread the sell one versus...

2837
02:46:23,530 --> 02:46:25,080
Sell all, you know.

2838
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:27,360
For speed running.

2839
02:46:31,470 --> 02:46:31,940
Anyway.

2840
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:34,040
OK, night time.

2841
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,600
One more time.

2842
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:41,940
How much money?

2843
02:46:41,940 --> 02:46:42,260
Oh.

2844
02:46:45,140 --> 02:46:47,640
We made...it was like a hundred something.

2845
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:48,780
So not bad.

2846
02:46:58,310 --> 02:46:59,390
Eel hole!

2847
02:47:13,080 --> 02:47:15,320
I'm gonna get another one just in case.

2848
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:22,280
Yeah, let's go.

2849
02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:24,260
Let's go home.

2850
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:30,600
Not the best.

2851
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:31,580
Not the best.

2852
02:47:32,180 --> 02:47:33,220
Not the best.

2853
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:35,240
Not the best.

2854
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:36,620
Not the best.

2855
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:38,420
Not the best.

2856
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:39,860
No!

2857
02:47:40,120 --> 02:47:40,720
Stay away!

2858
02:47:44,100 --> 02:47:44,600
No!

2859
02:47:47,820 --> 02:47:48,820
Not the typhoon!

2860
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:50,440
Or tornado!

2861
02:47:55,280 --> 02:47:56,000
OK.

2862
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,780
Now, maybe if I sleep...

2863
02:47:58,780 --> 02:48:00,940
OK, so we are gonna sell this creepy one.

2864
02:48:00,940 --> 02:48:02,680
We'll sell the creepy guy.

2865
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:04,100
A hundred dollars!

2866
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:04,500
Nice.

2867
02:48:05,060 --> 02:48:05,280
See?

2868
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:07,060
We are still farming, guys.

2869
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:09,060
OK.

2870
02:48:13,510 --> 02:48:14,990
How do I sell the one?

2871
02:48:15,710 --> 02:48:17,470
Because this is where...OK, see?

2872
02:48:17,550 --> 02:48:19,570
It says sell for a hundred and eight.

2873
02:48:20,470 --> 02:48:24,410
I press F, but down here it says sell all fish for F.

2874
02:48:25,110 --> 02:48:26,250
Click and drag.

2875
02:48:29,150 --> 02:48:31,930
Now if I...tap F.

2876
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:34,230
I see.

2877
02:48:34,530 --> 02:48:35,550
Thank you.

2878
02:48:40,470 --> 02:48:41,670
Holy moly.

2879
02:48:41,950 --> 02:48:42,410
Scary.

2880
02:48:43,510 --> 02:48:44,870
This guy is still fresh.

2881
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:46,670
Disgusting.

2882
02:48:46,830 --> 02:48:47,630
We don't want it.

2883
02:48:57,260 --> 02:49:00,060
I want to put on my pirate flag so bad.

2884
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:05,700
How long do you think it will take before it's rotten?

2885
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:07,420
Rotten to the core.

2886
02:49:10,580 --> 02:49:10,840
What?

2887
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:11,680
Missing.

2888
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:14,340
Oh, do I need to repair it?

2889
02:49:14,420 --> 02:49:14,860
Just kidding.

2890
02:49:21,010 --> 02:49:21,870
Yeah, it's broken.

2891
02:49:26,570 --> 02:49:27,690
We shall...

2892
02:49:29,650 --> 02:49:30,210
Repair.

2893
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:36,930
And then, if I sell it...

2894
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:38,450
It's a hundred and thirty-seven dollars.

2895
02:49:39,250 --> 02:49:39,790
Nice.

2896
02:49:39,790 --> 02:49:41,910
And then we can get...

2897
02:49:41,910 --> 02:49:44,390
Oh no, I wasn't going to get the big bad.

2898
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:46,790
What I think I'm going to do...

2899
02:49:47,310 --> 02:49:47,910
Hear me out.

2900
02:49:50,410 --> 02:49:51,650
I'm going to sell it.

2901
02:49:53,490 --> 02:49:54,490
And then...

2902
02:49:54,490 --> 02:49:56,950
I'm going to put my coastal rod back on.

2903
02:50:00,170 --> 02:50:01,170
Because now...

2904
02:50:01,170 --> 02:50:03,010
Even though...

2905
02:50:03,010 --> 02:50:04,790
I can't...

2906
02:50:06,730 --> 02:50:07,730
Use it...

2907
02:50:07,730 --> 02:50:09,770
I can...

2908
02:50:09,770 --> 02:50:10,990
Get the better boat.

2909
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:17,450
Floating dock.

2910
02:50:18,390 --> 02:50:18,970
Here we go!

2911
02:50:28,690 --> 02:50:33,910
I'm really sleepy, but I conscripted into the family hell divers game.

2912
02:50:33,910 --> 02:50:34,230
Oh.

2913
02:50:37,010 --> 02:50:37,490
Yeah!

2914
02:50:39,630 --> 02:50:43,810
Thank you for being my chill left ear fishing while the gun fights on the right.

2915
02:50:44,010 --> 02:50:45,230
Oh gosh, how can you concentrate?

2916
02:50:46,470 --> 02:50:48,190
Boat goes bintin, mint goes mintin.

2917
02:50:50,670 --> 02:50:51,970
Super E, welcome to membership.

2918
02:50:52,170 --> 02:50:52,930
Thank you!

2919
02:50:55,930 --> 02:50:56,410
Okay.

2920
02:50:57,290 --> 02:50:57,770
Alright.

2921
02:50:58,230 --> 02:50:59,450
Now we can upgrade.

2922
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:03,110
I can actually get this one.

2923
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:06,230
Rod space, cargo space.

2924
02:51:06,890 --> 02:51:08,410
I could get this one immediately.

2925
02:51:14,660 --> 02:51:16,720
I'm going to start just putting stuff in though.

2926
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:19,480
Because we have so much stuff in storage.

2927
02:51:21,080 --> 02:51:24,100
At this point, I have so much stuff in storage.

2928
02:51:24,380 --> 02:51:26,080
Materials here will be saved.

2929
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:26,480
Yeah.

2930
02:51:27,980 --> 02:51:29,320
Yeah, yeah.

2931
02:51:32,680 --> 02:51:34,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2932
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:34,840
Okay.

2933
02:51:38,320 --> 02:51:39,900
More spaces, more money.

2934
02:51:40,020 --> 02:51:40,760
So true.

2935
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:43,360
That's why it's so expensive to get it.

2936
02:51:44,860 --> 02:51:45,960
To get that upgrade.

2937
02:51:46,060 --> 02:51:46,960
Oh my gosh, look at that.

2938
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:49,060
Wow, we have just enough.

2939
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:50,300
Incredible!

2940
02:51:55,340 --> 02:51:55,800
Nice.

2941
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:04,280
Enough for all the upgrades.

2942
02:52:04,380 --> 02:52:05,280
I just need the money.

2943
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:09,140
And then, of course, obviously, the tier 3 hole.

2944
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:09,980
Damn, we're gaming!

2945
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:10,940
Finally!

2946
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:15,060
For research.

2947
02:52:17,320 --> 02:52:18,420
I have the one part.

2948
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:24,740
That's right, I was trying to get this large trough.

2949
02:52:30,010 --> 02:52:32,150
Which I think I will add to.

2950
02:52:33,530 --> 02:52:34,530
Is the eel still fresh?

2951
02:52:34,630 --> 02:52:35,350
Oh my gosh, stop it.

2952
02:52:36,010 --> 02:52:37,370
Why do I keep doing that?

2953
02:52:38,070 --> 02:52:40,370
My eel is...

2954
02:52:41,330 --> 02:52:41,890
Stale.

2955
02:52:43,390 --> 02:52:44,510
He's stale.

2956
02:52:46,590 --> 02:52:47,450
That's great.

2957
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:49,730
Look at that, he looks so cute.

2958
02:52:51,290 --> 02:52:53,050
I love the mutant version of him.

2959
02:52:59,270 --> 02:53:00,910
He's so cute.

2960
02:53:03,350 --> 02:53:04,370
Can you wink for me?

2961
02:53:04,410 --> 02:53:05,570
I need a new PFP.

2962
02:53:05,570 --> 02:53:07,050
What do you mean?

2963
02:53:07,270 --> 02:53:10,250
What do you mean?

2964
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:12,270
Is Nemi profile picture not good?

2965
02:53:14,810 --> 02:53:17,210
When it's over land, it's a tornado.

2966
02:53:17,370 --> 02:53:19,130
When it's over water, it's a water spout.

2967
02:53:19,310 --> 02:53:20,930
Sorry for being well actually about it.

2968
02:53:21,110 --> 02:53:22,650
You are so right, PH, though.

2969
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:31,010
Like that?

2970
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:32,850
Or...

2971
02:53:32,850 --> 02:53:33,930
Wait, hold on.

2972
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:44,740
Or...

2973
02:53:44,740 --> 02:53:46,960
I can't wink my other eye very well.

2974
02:53:49,140 --> 02:53:50,720
I can only wink this one well.

2975
02:53:55,810 --> 02:53:56,910
Like that?

2976
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:07,120
Or...

2977
02:54:08,460 --> 02:54:09,140
Wait.

2978
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:14,220
It doesn't work.

2979
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:17,760
Do angry wink.

2980
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:34,820
There you go.

2981
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:36,140
That should be enough, right?

2982
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:39,900
This should be enough food for you.

2983
02:54:45,630 --> 02:54:46,430
More.

2984
02:54:47,030 --> 02:54:48,150
You guys are so greedy.

2985
02:54:58,760 --> 02:54:59,560
Cute.

2986
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:14,440
Stop it.

2987
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,080
What's wrong with being greedy?

2988
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:19,580
Maybe it's okay for greedy sometimes.

2989
02:55:24,020 --> 02:55:26,540
What else have we not caught in the gale?

2990
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:28,760
This guy is shallow.

2991
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:30,020
We haven't caught him yet.

2992
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:33,300
The oceanic guys.

2993
02:55:35,220 --> 02:55:36,060
What is this?

2994
02:55:36,660 --> 02:55:37,280
The shallow.

2995
02:55:38,100 --> 02:55:39,660
Let's go back to that shallow area.

2996
02:55:41,740 --> 02:55:42,380
Undock.

2997
02:55:43,220 --> 02:55:44,680
Where we got the eel.

2998
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:48,180
And we can maybe get some other guys too.

2999
02:55:49,500 --> 02:55:51,700
What are you talking about?

3000
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:55,800
Oh, the crabs.

3001
02:56:04,220 --> 02:56:05,920
Crab, crab, crab, crab.

3002
02:56:08,860 --> 02:56:09,920
Is this oceanic?

3003
02:56:13,580 --> 02:56:14,220
Coastal.

3004
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:15,640
That's a little perch.

3005
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:17,560
Here's some wood.

3006
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:18,640
I'll come back for later.

3007
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:22,480
Wow, I'm not like foaming at the mouth for wood anymore.

3008
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:23,840
I've grown.

3009
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:26,900
Oh, wow, there's no eels here.

3010
02:56:29,380 --> 02:56:30,960
Oops, I forgot my trawl.

3011
02:56:31,120 --> 02:56:31,640
That's okay though.

3012
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:33,980
What are you?

3013
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:36,140
Blackmouth seagull.

3014
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:40,660
You are a messed up little fish.

3015
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:41,440
That's what you are.

3016
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:43,480
You're a disturbing little creature.

3017
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:44,520
That's what you are.

3018
02:56:45,060 --> 02:56:46,520
That's me talking to Ocelot.

3019
02:56:48,260 --> 02:56:51,480
Yeah, you're just a screwed up little guy.

3020
02:56:56,500 --> 02:56:57,420
Decaying blackmouth.

3021
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:03,260
Shimmering blackness permeates the flesh of this relentless fish.

3022
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:07,620
Muscles atrophied and decaying, but still it swims on.

3023
02:57:07,720 --> 02:57:09,780
Oh my gosh, have you guys... That's like a real thing though.

3024
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:12,520
Have you guys ever seen the fish that are like...

3025
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:14,200
The zombie fish?

3026
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:15,760
The zombie salmon?

3027
02:57:17,260 --> 02:57:18,320
They're so icky.

3028
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:25,080
How's the eel?

3029
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:27,920
I think he is stale still.

3030
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:33,700
What's it blowing towards?

3031
02:57:41,130 --> 02:57:42,390
What's it blowing towards?

3032
02:57:44,310 --> 02:57:46,090
The wind is so mysterious.

3033
02:57:47,690 --> 02:57:48,650
I love it.

3034
02:57:50,630 --> 02:57:52,450
How long until it's rotten?

3035
02:57:52,870 --> 02:57:55,030
I guess I could sleep again maybe.

3036
02:58:07,670 --> 02:58:08,850
God, I just looked it up.

3037
02:58:08,890 --> 02:58:09,430
That is wild.

3038
02:58:09,510 --> 02:58:10,630
It's creepy, right?

3039
02:58:11,690 --> 02:58:12,570
Such fine stuff.

3040
02:58:12,630 --> 02:58:13,050
Thank you.

3041
02:58:19,650 --> 02:58:20,690
You're welcome.

3042
02:58:27,430 --> 02:58:28,990
I'm never doing fine stuff ever again.

3043
02:58:31,390 --> 02:58:34,330
Oh, a black sea bass landed on deck.

3044
02:58:41,870 --> 02:58:43,150
Dang it.

3045
02:58:45,770 --> 02:58:47,310
This is... This is why.

3046
02:58:51,230 --> 02:58:52,830
Good drift though.

3047
02:58:53,230 --> 02:58:53,490
Thanks.

3048
02:58:54,970 --> 02:58:56,490
Captain Ma is on the scene.

3049
02:58:59,570 --> 02:59:01,090
It's still stale.

3050
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:08,520
Sell, sell, sell.

3051
02:59:09,380 --> 02:59:10,220
And then we'll repair.

3052
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:13,240
Oh, wrong thing.

3053
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:13,860
Sorry, my bad.

3054
02:59:15,220 --> 02:59:15,780
Repair.

3055
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:23,280
Been enjoying my deliveries in Death Stranding to prep for two while watching you dread.

3056
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:31,380
Yeah, in a couple weeks I plan on doing a Death Stranding week.

3057
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:37,240
That water spout timed it on purpose.

3058
02:59:37,720 --> 02:59:38,680
Not that spout.

3059
02:59:39,180 --> 02:59:41,100
Yeah, it's not mean as the spout.

3060
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:43,480
So true.

3061
02:59:44,500 --> 02:59:46,480
Oh wait, let's sleep actually.

3062
02:59:47,300 --> 02:59:49,880
Let's sleep actually and so then I can...

3063
02:59:50,480 --> 02:59:52,880
Because I also want to get ready for Death Stranding too.

3064
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:56,360
Have you ever played through Policenauts?

3065
02:59:56,400 --> 02:59:57,320
I have not.

3066
02:59:58,260 --> 02:59:59,740
But yes, I've been... Running!

3067
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:06,360
Guys, let's go complete a quest!

3068
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:12,560
I will play Policenauts though.

3069
03:00:15,640 --> 03:00:18,880
Just a matter of... Of when.

3070
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:22,620
Lady?

3071
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:23,480
Where's the lady?

3072
03:00:23,980 --> 03:00:24,600
Oh, here she is.

3073
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:25,420
Ingfell resident.

3074
03:00:27,060 --> 03:00:28,860
Here's your aged Conguriel.

3075
03:00:30,220 --> 03:00:31,400
Perfect, this will do wonderfully.

3076
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:33,080
I can offer you a small sum in thanks.

3077
03:00:34,840 --> 03:00:35,740
Safe travels.

3078
03:00:38,140 --> 03:00:38,960
Thank you!

3079
03:00:39,740 --> 03:00:41,180
I got 150 bucks.

3080
03:00:43,480 --> 03:00:44,340
Let's go!

3081
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:47,340
Actually, I have to go to the little ghost's room.

3082
03:00:47,420 --> 03:00:47,840
Is that okay?

3083
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:52,480
I will go...

3084
03:00:52,480 --> 03:00:54,300
How long have I been streaming for?

3085
03:00:55,860 --> 03:00:56,740
Three hours!

3086
03:00:57,020 --> 03:00:57,940
Yeah, okay.

3087
03:00:58,620 --> 03:01:00,360
I'm gonna get some more tea as well.

3088
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:04,900
So, just a short little break.

3089
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:06,780
I'm literally gone fishing.

3090
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:09,700
Go ghost, go.

3091
03:01:09,860 --> 03:01:11,280
I will take us with you!

3092
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:15,160
I mean... Okay, I'm gonna take the mic with me.

3093
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:21,780
Okay, I'll be right back.

3094
03:04:42,090 --> 03:04:43,150
I'm back!

3095
03:04:43,770 --> 03:04:44,630
I'm back!

3096
03:04:45,550 --> 03:04:49,130
Oh my gosh, pollen is making my throat all itchy.

3097
03:04:49,990 --> 03:04:51,430
You guys also have...

3098
03:04:53,490 --> 03:04:56,830
Do you guys also have allergies recently?

3099
03:04:59,550 --> 03:05:00,330
Welcome back.

3100
03:05:00,470 --> 03:05:00,890
Tadaima!

3101
03:05:02,870 --> 03:05:03,630
Tadaima!

3102
03:05:08,960 --> 03:05:09,500
Yeah.

3103
03:05:10,480 --> 03:05:12,400
Somehow I've been spared from it this year.

3104
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:19,020
I've been like opening the windows a lot in the maid cafe, so...

3105
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:23,580
It's like extra bad, but it just feels so nice.

3106
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:26,560
It feels so nice.

3107
03:05:31,850 --> 03:05:32,390
Lofton.

3108
03:05:32,570 --> 03:05:33,170
What's that?

3109
03:05:36,690 --> 03:05:38,630
There's still snow on the ground up there.

3110
03:05:38,690 --> 03:05:39,030
Wow.

3111
03:05:47,150 --> 03:05:47,910
Okay.

3112
03:05:48,950 --> 03:05:50,050
Note of entry.

3113
03:05:53,660 --> 03:05:56,340
That's opening the windows to let the ghosts out.

3114
03:06:02,250 --> 03:06:05,110
But like... But like other ghosts.

3115
03:06:05,630 --> 03:06:09,830
You wouldn't let me out when I'm in your home.

3116
03:06:16,770 --> 03:06:19,350
That's like the lame ghost.

3117
03:06:19,810 --> 03:06:22,090
The ghost... Those ghosts suck.

3118
03:06:22,130 --> 03:06:23,070
Yeah, I agree.

3119
03:06:23,070 --> 03:06:26,450
You want to get those ghosts out, but Minto you want...

3120
03:06:26,450 --> 03:06:30,330
You want Minto to stay, right?

3121
03:06:32,450 --> 03:06:33,610
Windows taped shut.

3122
03:06:35,990 --> 03:06:37,270
I'm trapped.

3123
03:06:37,830 --> 03:06:39,330
No windows in the basement.

3124
03:06:40,890 --> 03:06:42,330
I'm definitely not getting out.

3125
03:06:44,050 --> 03:06:44,690
Yes.

3126
03:06:45,050 --> 03:06:45,610
Yes.

3127
03:06:46,070 --> 03:06:46,630
Yes.

3128
03:06:46,890 --> 03:06:47,830
You can't leave.

3129
03:06:47,970 --> 03:06:48,270
Okay.

3130
03:06:48,270 --> 03:06:48,430
Okay.

3131
03:06:50,710 --> 03:06:52,170
Okay, you said it, not me.

3132
03:06:56,690 --> 03:06:58,810
Alright, good job guys.

3133
03:06:58,990 --> 03:07:00,770
We just did...

3134
03:07:02,830 --> 03:07:03,290
another...

3135
03:07:03,290 --> 03:07:04,790
quest, finally.

3136
03:07:06,890 --> 03:07:10,830
If you could go out the window if you want, you're welcome to stay.

3137
03:07:10,930 --> 03:07:11,470
I'm staying.

3138
03:07:12,010 --> 03:07:13,610
I mean, well, I mean...

3139
03:07:13,610 --> 03:07:15,890
Only because you were so begging me to stay here.

3140
03:07:17,630 --> 03:07:18,390
Minky!

3141
03:07:19,590 --> 03:07:21,430
Catch a tiger mackerel.

3142
03:07:23,590 --> 03:07:25,790
Where do I find the tiger mackerel?

3143
03:07:25,890 --> 03:07:27,950
Have I gotten that before already?

3144
03:07:29,690 --> 03:07:30,930
Marrows, tiger.

3145
03:07:31,750 --> 03:07:33,250
We got the blue mackerel.

3146
03:07:34,110 --> 03:07:35,230
Tiger, tiger.

3147
03:07:36,690 --> 03:07:39,130
Oh, tiger mackerel.

3148
03:07:39,490 --> 03:07:40,450
At the gale cliffs.

3149
03:07:41,510 --> 03:07:42,350
I caught six?

3150
03:07:42,730 --> 03:07:43,190
When?

3151
03:07:43,190 --> 03:07:45,970
But they're coastal.

3152
03:07:50,280 --> 03:07:53,420
It's like still morning even, so this is perfect time...

3153
03:07:54,420 --> 03:07:55,860
to catch and to deliver.

3154
03:08:02,510 --> 03:08:04,330
Minto, a super cool smile.

3155
03:08:05,850 --> 03:08:06,730
Thanks, Dekofit.

3156
03:08:07,850 --> 03:08:08,710
Thanks for 11 months.

3157
03:08:08,750 --> 03:08:09,850
I can't believe it.

3158
03:08:10,330 --> 03:08:11,690
11 months.

3159
03:08:12,870 --> 03:08:14,090
I can't believe it.

3160
03:08:16,750 --> 03:08:19,810
Alright, that guy was weird.

3161
03:08:23,730 --> 03:08:25,470
Where was that guy?

3162
03:08:28,110 --> 03:08:29,450
And a fang tooth.

3163
03:08:32,670 --> 03:08:35,570
On the island between the Marrows and Gale Cliffs.

3164
03:08:38,430 --> 03:08:40,030
So like here maybe?

3165
03:08:40,910 --> 03:08:42,230
Around this area?

3166
03:08:42,430 --> 03:08:43,550
Or here?

3167
03:09:01,700 --> 03:09:03,000
Catbuzz, thanks for 11 months.

3168
03:09:03,260 --> 03:09:03,840
I can't either.

3169
03:09:04,760 --> 03:09:05,840
Feels like you just came back.

3170
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:07,100
I know, me too.

3171
03:09:09,400 --> 03:09:11,120
Might be even cuter when you're clink.

3172
03:09:12,140 --> 03:09:13,140
I'm leaving.

3173
03:09:13,360 --> 03:09:14,840
I'm taking my boat.

3174
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:16,860
I'm taking my boat!

3175
03:09:26,400 --> 03:09:28,200
Wait, I didn't even notice...

3176
03:09:30,260 --> 03:09:32,660
How much more storage we've got.

3177
03:09:36,480 --> 03:09:39,060
Was he in here?

3178
03:09:40,660 --> 03:09:42,880
I think maybe in here.

3179
03:09:43,420 --> 03:09:45,140
There she blows.

3180
03:09:49,730 --> 03:09:50,330
I forgot.

3181
03:09:50,790 --> 03:09:53,310
He happened so fast I couldn't get my camera out.

3182
03:09:56,880 --> 03:09:57,480
There he is.

3183
03:09:58,120 --> 03:09:59,340
Sad and small.

3184
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:01,720
Hungry.

3185
03:10:03,160 --> 03:10:04,220
Hello mister.

3186
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:05,780
I got your tiger.

3187
03:10:06,540 --> 03:10:08,940
He's like literally bones.

3188
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:12,900
More still empty tiger mackerel.

3189
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:15,040
They rip it.

3190
03:10:15,220 --> 03:10:17,580
Again, they rip into the flesh of the fish, drawing out its heart.

3191
03:10:17,940 --> 03:10:19,440
It's consumed as quickly as the first.

3192
03:10:20,440 --> 03:10:21,240
Almost fulfilled.

3193
03:10:21,900 --> 03:10:23,700
They point to a fish on the final scroll.

3194
03:10:24,500 --> 03:10:25,760
A snake mackerel.

3195
03:10:25,900 --> 03:10:26,200
We know.

3196
03:10:26,320 --> 03:10:27,400
We've caught that one before.

3197
03:10:30,560 --> 03:10:30,960
Where?

3198
03:10:34,560 --> 03:10:36,660
Snake mackerel.

3199
03:10:37,380 --> 03:10:39,140
Snake mackerel.

3200
03:10:39,920 --> 03:10:41,860
Snake mackerel.

3201
03:10:42,580 --> 03:10:44,400
Snake mackerel.

3202
03:10:45,160 --> 03:10:46,720
Snake macaroni.

3203
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:48,400
Devil's spine.

3204
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:53,220
Oh Andrew!

3205
03:10:53,900 --> 03:10:54,900
Thanks for the breed!

3206
03:10:57,620 --> 03:10:59,400
Thank you, thank you.

3207
03:10:59,620 --> 03:11:00,240
Thank you, thank you.

3208
03:11:01,860 --> 03:11:02,340
Alright.

3209
03:11:03,700 --> 03:11:04,600
Devil's spine.

3210
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:06,040
That's pretty far from here, buddy.

3211
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:08,400
You're asking a lot.

3212
03:11:08,540 --> 03:11:09,820
Actually, it's like right there.

3213
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:12,940
You can see it on the map.

3214
03:11:14,580 --> 03:11:16,520
Well, I guess that's like kind of the area.

3215
03:11:22,620 --> 03:11:23,780
Just in case I forget.

3216
03:11:29,780 --> 03:11:31,040
Cute twintail minky!

3217
03:11:32,200 --> 03:11:33,320
I guess should we go?

3218
03:11:33,980 --> 03:11:35,380
I think we'll make it.

3219
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:46,900
Or we'll have to stop by... Oh my gosh, this is big money so we definitely need to get this.

3220
03:11:49,020 --> 03:11:49,620
Wait!

3221
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:53,480
Hooked sailfish.

3222
03:11:54,340 --> 03:11:56,100
Wait, we haven't caught this before.

3223
03:11:57,260 --> 03:12:00,400
Spindles of bone protrude from discolored muscle.

3224
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:02,340
A hooked bill curves inward.

3225
03:12:02,780 --> 03:12:04,660
A lure for something greater.

3226
03:12:06,240 --> 03:12:08,100
Maybe then I should go home.

3227
03:12:08,720 --> 03:12:10,540
And drop off our...

3228
03:12:10,540 --> 03:12:11,440
Okay.

3229
03:12:14,540 --> 03:12:15,460
Change of plans.

3230
03:12:15,980 --> 03:12:16,500
We go home.

3231
03:12:16,980 --> 03:12:18,120
We sell some of our stuff.

3232
03:12:18,680 --> 03:12:20,240
Because I also have some treasures to sell.

3233
03:12:22,040 --> 03:12:23,440
And we sell this guy.

3234
03:12:24,020 --> 03:12:25,100
Because he'll give us big money.

3235
03:12:27,300 --> 03:12:28,940
And we need the big money.

3236
03:12:34,360 --> 03:12:36,320
I love the OST in this game.

3237
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:38,440
So good.

3238
03:12:40,560 --> 03:12:41,060
Wood.

3239
03:12:43,480 --> 03:12:44,680
Where were you?

3240
03:12:49,520 --> 03:12:50,680
Mint on the telly!

3241
03:12:50,860 --> 03:12:52,080
Chocomint ice in my hand.

3242
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:53,180
Tis a nice Sunday.

3243
03:12:53,860 --> 03:12:55,080
It's such a chill Sunday.

3244
03:12:55,460 --> 03:12:56,060
At least for me.

3245
03:12:56,120 --> 03:12:57,500
I hope it's chill for you guys too.

3246
03:12:58,740 --> 03:13:00,020
Sell the ring.

3247
03:13:02,980 --> 03:13:05,020
Actually, sell... Oh, that was the only trinket I had?

3248
03:13:05,360 --> 03:13:07,360
Wait, what about this chain?

3249
03:13:08,140 --> 03:13:09,020
Can I not sell this?

3250
03:13:12,970 --> 03:13:14,690
Does it not... Do we need this?

3251
03:13:21,530 --> 03:13:23,730
Did you see the new rideable gas in Minecraft?

3252
03:13:23,870 --> 03:13:24,210
I did!

3253
03:13:24,610 --> 03:13:25,710
Yeah, I talked about it earlier.

3254
03:13:30,490 --> 03:13:32,090
Oh, there's no sell all in storage.

3255
03:13:32,210 --> 03:13:33,030
Ah, I see, I see.

3256
03:13:34,810 --> 03:13:35,510
Thank you.

3257
03:13:36,350 --> 03:13:38,210
And we give this guy our flag.

3258
03:13:40,550 --> 03:13:41,610
You want to attach it?

3259
03:13:41,710 --> 03:13:41,850
Yes.

3260
03:13:42,730 --> 03:13:43,230
Alright!

3261
03:13:47,170 --> 03:13:47,670
Happy...

3262
03:13:48,970 --> 03:13:49,970
Happy pirate!

3263
03:13:54,530 --> 03:13:58,590
There's a... I buy the X and Gale Cliffs if you want to continue the main quest.

3264
03:14:00,470 --> 03:14:02,050
There's a main quest.

3265
03:14:02,050 --> 03:14:03,190
Fighting Gojisai.

3266
03:14:03,230 --> 03:14:03,910
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

3267
03:14:03,990 --> 03:14:04,650
Thank you!

3268
03:14:05,290 --> 03:14:08,050
Okay, we have to go to Gale Winds anyway, so...

3269
03:14:09,490 --> 03:14:11,130
What were the winds pointing to?

3270
03:14:11,670 --> 03:14:12,230
Mysterious.

3271
03:14:25,040 --> 03:14:26,160
Big money!

3272
03:14:26,800 --> 03:14:27,640
Big money!

3273
03:14:30,240 --> 03:14:31,160
Big money!

3274
03:14:31,160 --> 03:14:31,300
Money!

3275
03:14:35,280 --> 03:14:36,000
Holy money!

3276
03:14:36,620 --> 03:14:36,980
Money!

3277
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:38,440
Money!

3278
03:14:39,480 --> 03:14:39,840
Money!

3279
03:14:42,160 --> 03:14:43,320
Which one should we do?

3280
03:14:50,630 --> 03:14:52,590
We actually... Wait, how much money do I have?

3281
03:14:53,450 --> 03:14:54,850
I have 700 dollars!

3282
03:14:55,130 --> 03:14:56,810
Wait, I might be able to do everything.

3283
03:14:58,830 --> 03:15:00,330
You guys, I can do all of them.

3284
03:15:05,300 --> 03:15:09,360
But do I want to buy more little engines?

3285
03:15:12,540 --> 03:15:14,520
Oh, and this makes my rods bigger.

3286
03:15:18,610 --> 03:15:21,510
My one thing about the rods though is that I...

3287
03:15:23,070 --> 03:15:27,550
Even if I upgrade, I don't have any better ones, you know what I mean?

3288
03:15:31,390 --> 03:15:35,870
Oh yeah, also, I want to... Oh, I didn't buy this one.

3289
03:15:36,970 --> 03:15:40,290
I only have... Oh my gosh, it's still 414 dollars.

3290
03:15:41,370 --> 03:15:42,190
Use two?

3291
03:15:46,630 --> 03:15:48,390
Painter can paint your shipment with rarecrafts.

3292
03:15:48,410 --> 03:15:49,950
Yeah, I do remember that!

3293
03:15:50,030 --> 03:15:50,890
I do remember that.

3294
03:16:04,500 --> 03:16:09,640
If I have more rod space, I might be able to use this and this.

3295
03:16:11,060 --> 03:16:12,340
Did we pay off our debt yet?

3296
03:16:12,420 --> 03:16:14,040
Oh yeah, like a long time ago.

3297
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:21,200
The time... Oh, it's not... People said it's not a timed quest.

3298
03:16:22,380 --> 03:16:25,140
Or rather, I think it used to be a timed quest?

3299
03:16:25,640 --> 03:16:26,920
No, it's not a timed quest, no.

3300
03:16:30,260 --> 03:16:32,640
Because we spent a lot of time.

3301
03:16:32,860 --> 03:16:33,940
Yeah, it's not timed anymore.

3302
03:16:34,520 --> 03:16:35,800
The devs changed it.

3303
03:16:36,340 --> 03:16:42,140
Apparently the devs changed it, but thank you for worrying about it.

3304
03:16:46,770 --> 03:16:47,630
Oh, it was minted?

3305
03:16:51,870 --> 03:16:57,930
Wait, okay, so if I get the... If I get the rod space upgrade...

3306
03:16:58,830 --> 03:17:02,510
I would be able to use the net as well.

3307
03:17:02,770 --> 03:17:04,470
Okay, let's get this.

3308
03:17:11,360 --> 03:17:14,100
We are mathematizing.

3309
03:17:15,080 --> 03:17:16,760
Wait, how do I remove this?

3310
03:17:16,900 --> 03:17:17,620
Oh, uninstall.

3311
03:17:19,400 --> 03:17:20,520
Look at this.

3312
03:17:27,300 --> 03:17:30,320
And then, the net.

3313
03:17:34,330 --> 03:17:35,850
It's still only coastal.

3314
03:17:38,470 --> 03:17:39,310
Hold on.

3315
03:17:46,190 --> 03:17:48,030
I still need one more research point.

3316
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:53,260
I think I'll still get it though.

3317
03:17:58,060 --> 03:17:59,500
Still great passive income.

3318
03:17:59,820 --> 03:18:02,700
I think I'll still get it and it's good for two days.

3319
03:18:02,700 --> 03:18:08,840
Oh, I wouldn't even be able to hold the bigger one anyway because this is only for net or for rod.

3320
03:18:11,400 --> 03:18:17,200
I can't buy anymore engine for now.

3321
03:18:17,880 --> 03:18:20,940
I think that's what I might do next is fill up the engine.

3322
03:18:25,600 --> 03:18:26,980
It'll pay for itself.

3323
03:18:27,120 --> 03:18:27,360
True.

3324
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:29,300
Alright, we sleep.

3325
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:32,520
We undock.

3326
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:35,000
We...

3327
03:18:35,640 --> 03:18:37,800
Set our trawl net out.

3328
03:18:38,180 --> 03:18:40,300
And we head over to...

3329
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:43,180
The devil's spawn.

3330
03:18:45,060 --> 03:18:46,140
Good morning, Mito.

3331
03:18:48,040 --> 03:18:48,700
Oh, wait.

3332
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:50,720
Oh my gosh, I forgot to...

3333
03:18:50,720 --> 03:18:52,100
Does this thing still have any fish in it?

3334
03:18:52,780 --> 03:18:54,300
The crab in here are...

3335
03:18:57,120 --> 03:18:58,320
I'll come back for it.

3336
03:19:07,030 --> 03:19:07,870
Okay.

3337
03:19:10,030 --> 03:19:12,050
Now this is dredging.

3338
03:19:12,330 --> 03:19:20,430
I probably could have some more crab traps out...

3339
03:19:20,950 --> 03:19:22,610
Around the world.

3340
03:19:22,770 --> 03:19:26,250
I haven't even gone to the twisted strand yet.

3341
03:19:27,310 --> 03:19:28,690
I haven't even been there.

3342
03:19:34,300 --> 03:19:38,260
I'm guessing the light blue is the coastal water so I'm going to kind of...

3343
03:19:39,120 --> 03:19:40,560
Stay in there for a bit.

3344
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:43,820
Swordfish to your left.

3345
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:44,840
Should I get it?

3346
03:19:45,580 --> 03:19:46,900
I did see it.

3347
03:19:47,420 --> 03:19:47,960
It's okay.

3348
03:19:49,240 --> 03:19:50,140
I'm already past.

3349
03:19:57,580 --> 03:19:59,180
What did I need to get here?

3350
03:20:02,660 --> 03:20:05,760
Oh, oh, oh...

3351
03:20:08,800 --> 03:20:12,380
Wait, he might come back.

3352
03:20:15,740 --> 03:20:16,860
Is that him right there?

3353
03:20:21,560 --> 03:20:22,160
Wheel!

3354
03:20:25,890 --> 03:20:27,290
It's a wheel!

3355
03:20:30,030 --> 03:20:31,510
Oh, I can really zoom.

3356
03:20:32,230 --> 03:20:34,550
What kind of technology does this lady have?

3357
03:20:36,410 --> 03:20:37,010
Wheel!

3358
03:20:45,350 --> 03:20:47,490
I took a picture of the whale.

3359
03:20:55,280 --> 03:20:57,080
Holy moly.

3360
03:20:57,640 --> 03:20:58,480
That guy is humongous.

3361
03:21:00,640 --> 03:21:02,200
It's a tiger mackerel.

3362
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:04,880
And he is...

3363
03:21:07,590 --> 03:21:08,300
Oh wow!

3364
03:21:08,720 --> 03:21:11,360
There's different versions of...

3365
03:21:13,940 --> 03:21:15,740
I see.

3366
03:21:15,740 --> 03:21:20,000
Because I was like, I thought I got the mutated sailfish before.

3367
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,100
Interesting, interesting.

3368
03:21:24,860 --> 03:21:26,180
Snake mackerel.

3369
03:21:26,880 --> 03:21:27,900
He's a coastal man.

3370
03:21:29,020 --> 03:21:29,660
Is this coastal?

3371
03:21:32,880 --> 03:21:34,440
Is this a snake mackerel?

3372
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:34,840
No way.

3373
03:21:38,650 --> 03:21:40,430
Hell yeah it is.

3374
03:21:43,710 --> 03:21:45,390
What was...

3375
03:21:47,110 --> 03:21:48,910
Wait, there was a guy somewhere where?

3376
03:21:49,270 --> 03:21:50,530
Mint, tell us a funny joke.

3377
03:21:55,290 --> 03:21:56,530
Oh, sorry.

3378
03:22:01,150 --> 03:22:02,690
My fishing skills?

3379
03:22:09,360 --> 03:22:10,820
Alex, thanks for 11 bucks.

3380
03:22:10,860 --> 03:22:12,140
Thank you.

3381
03:22:15,110 --> 03:22:16,940
There was a guy, no?

3382
03:22:32,960 --> 03:22:35,200
Where is he though, the other guy?

3383
03:22:36,620 --> 03:22:39,120
By the fanatic, but not fanatic.

3384
03:22:40,580 --> 03:22:41,440
What was that?

3385
03:22:44,040 --> 03:22:45,100
I heard a bad sound.

3386
03:22:45,800 --> 03:22:48,100
Oh, not a bad sound.

3387
03:22:48,980 --> 03:22:49,920
Just Orca.

3388
03:22:52,440 --> 03:22:55,080
Did you watch the latest episode of Solo Leveling?

3389
03:22:55,600 --> 03:22:58,920
I have not watched Solo Leveling.

3390
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:02,400
I have not watched it.

3391
03:23:10,190 --> 03:23:13,090
I'm scared to travel in here because of the mom.

3392
03:23:14,090 --> 03:23:15,970
And the little baby fish.

3393
03:23:21,760 --> 03:23:22,800
They're hungry.

3394
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:25,040
Hungry fish.

3395
03:23:25,620 --> 03:23:26,800
I see that over there though.

3396
03:23:27,260 --> 03:23:28,220
I wanna grab it.

3397
03:23:28,320 --> 03:23:28,720
Let's go.

3398
03:23:29,460 --> 03:23:31,440
Wait, I'm gonna save at the dock?

3399
03:23:34,400 --> 03:23:35,700
It's also getting late.

3400
03:23:36,400 --> 03:23:37,560
But I'm gonna save at the dock.

3401
03:23:40,820 --> 03:23:42,840
Oh wait, all my fish are gonna die.

3402
03:23:46,830 --> 03:23:49,410
He can eat stale fish.

3403
03:23:51,130 --> 03:23:52,050
Most likely.

3404
03:23:59,340 --> 03:24:00,980
And I have these guys in here.

3405
03:24:01,040 --> 03:24:01,980
They'll stay fresh.

3406
03:24:05,540 --> 03:24:07,740
These guys, the net fish will be fine.

3407
03:24:10,440 --> 03:24:12,420
Or should I just go deliver it to him?

3408
03:24:12,680 --> 03:24:13,540
And come back?

3409
03:24:15,580 --> 03:24:16,880
I can't decide.

3410
03:24:18,900 --> 03:24:20,000
It's so red.

3411
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:21,540
Oh my gosh, I can't see anything.

3412
03:24:28,500 --> 03:24:30,000
Can you move from storage to net?

3413
03:24:30,160 --> 03:24:30,620
Let's see.

3414
03:24:31,820 --> 03:24:35,000
No, it doesn't look like it.

3415
03:24:46,950 --> 03:24:47,890
I'll come back.

3416
03:24:50,630 --> 03:24:51,770
I'm just gonna sleep.

3417
03:24:52,090 --> 03:24:52,650
It's fine.

3418
03:24:55,790 --> 03:24:57,650
Wooly gooly, thank you for your 11 bombs.

3419
03:24:58,490 --> 03:24:59,870
A memorable man!

3420
03:25:00,690 --> 03:25:02,590
Oh my goodness, thank you so much for the 15 candidates!

3421
03:25:05,130 --> 03:25:05,830
Thank you!

3422
03:25:06,070 --> 03:25:06,890
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3423
03:25:09,290 --> 03:25:10,090
Alright, undock.

3424
03:25:11,790 --> 03:25:12,250
Let's see.

3425
03:25:14,010 --> 03:25:15,070
They're just stale.

3426
03:25:21,290 --> 03:25:22,170
What is that?

3427
03:25:24,750 --> 03:25:26,050
Oh, it's a message in a bottle.

3428
03:25:32,030 --> 03:25:33,930
What is that sound?

3429
03:25:34,150 --> 03:25:35,270
It's scaring me.

3430
03:25:41,210 --> 03:25:45,910
Okay, let's go back to our freaky fellow.

3431
03:25:49,240 --> 03:25:50,550
What is that sound?

3432
03:25:54,060 --> 03:25:55,340
I don't like it.

3433
03:25:58,840 --> 03:25:59,940
Big mama?

3434
03:26:02,870 --> 03:26:03,360
Nice!

3435
03:26:03,360 --> 03:26:03,940
Nice!

3436
03:26:08,780 --> 03:26:11,740
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

3437
03:26:11,900 --> 03:26:12,940
I am definitely not.

3438
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:13,800
I need to go south.

3439
03:26:17,820 --> 03:26:18,740
You turn!

3440
03:26:30,360 --> 03:26:32,400
I'll think about doing the DLCs.

3441
03:26:33,240 --> 03:26:38,280
We'll see how much I do of this game though.

3442
03:26:40,580 --> 03:26:42,140
Rather, how long it takes me.

3443
03:26:45,180 --> 03:26:46,660
YouTube is...

3444
03:26:46,660 --> 03:26:50,280
Wait, YouTube is meeting the fishing community today.

3445
03:26:50,860 --> 03:26:51,620
Wait, what's that?

3446
03:26:54,100 --> 03:26:55,720
What are you talking about?

3447
03:26:58,820 --> 03:26:59,560
Okay.

3448
03:27:00,520 --> 03:27:02,160
And he is...

3449
03:27:02,160 --> 03:27:03,640
Like, right here, no?

3450
03:27:04,240 --> 03:27:05,060
Right here.

3451
03:27:07,760 --> 03:27:08,520
Okay.

3452
03:27:08,520 --> 03:27:10,300
Our little guy.

3453
03:27:20,360 --> 03:27:23,760
The logo of YouTube today is a fish in a rod?

3454
03:27:27,320 --> 03:27:29,300
Is it this way?

3455
03:27:33,360 --> 03:27:38,920
Sometimes it's confusing when you're looking at the map upside down.

3456
03:27:40,480 --> 03:27:42,280
And they are rotting.

3457
03:27:42,360 --> 03:27:43,620
He'll probably still eat it.

3458
03:27:46,540 --> 03:27:47,480
I believe.

3459
03:27:48,360 --> 03:27:51,160
I believe he'll eat it still.

3460
03:27:51,820 --> 03:27:53,100
The rotting fish, you know?

3461
03:27:57,070 --> 03:27:58,130
We're almost there!

3462
03:27:58,290 --> 03:27:59,030
Oh, there he is!

3463
03:28:00,670 --> 03:28:02,090
I almost passed you, buddy.

3464
03:28:02,590 --> 03:28:03,750
Gosh, why are you so small?

3465
03:28:06,050 --> 03:28:08,050
He's like the tiniest person ever.

3466
03:28:08,890 --> 03:28:12,230
Every fish is ginormous compared to you.

3467
03:28:20,990 --> 03:28:25,110
Oh, see, it worked!

3468
03:28:29,300 --> 03:28:31,040
Berry bug.

3469
03:28:32,320 --> 03:28:33,240
Where are you?

3470
03:28:34,960 --> 03:28:36,140
Oh, berry ray?

3471
03:28:36,660 --> 03:28:37,380
What?

3472
03:28:41,560 --> 03:28:42,880
Berry bug ray?

3473
03:28:46,960 --> 03:28:48,460
Paperbacks, thanks for the five gift card!

3474
03:28:49,600 --> 03:28:50,080
Berry!

3475
03:28:53,100 --> 03:28:53,580
Berry!

3476
03:28:54,320 --> 03:28:55,960
Why does she say bug like that?

3477
03:28:57,860 --> 03:28:59,740
What's wrong with the way I say bug?

3478
03:29:04,620 --> 03:29:05,860
Mervy, thanks for the five gift card.

3479
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:08,160
Wait, did a notification show up?

3480
03:29:08,680 --> 03:29:09,740
I just didn't see it.

3481
03:29:11,880 --> 03:29:13,240
Thanks for the red berry.

3482
03:29:14,960 --> 03:29:15,660
Thanks, girl.

3483
03:29:16,040 --> 03:29:16,440
Thanks.

3484
03:29:16,740 --> 03:29:17,200
It did?

3485
03:29:17,320 --> 03:29:18,160
Oh, sorry.

3486
03:29:18,860 --> 03:29:20,340
I'm so invested in this game.

3487
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:21,840
Berry, you should play this game.

3488
03:29:21,940 --> 03:29:22,940
Oh my god, it's so much fun.

3489
03:29:24,060 --> 03:29:24,920
It's so fun.

3490
03:29:25,540 --> 03:29:27,000
Thanks for the five gift card!

3491
03:29:27,320 --> 03:29:30,660
Their head tilts upward to look at you.

3492
03:29:31,020 --> 03:29:33,240
They take a book from inside their robe and hand it over.

3493
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:35,000
Hunger sated.

3494
03:29:35,280 --> 03:29:36,100
Now I wait.

3495
03:29:36,440 --> 03:29:38,880
They cross their arms and appear to fall into a deep sleep.

3496
03:29:39,680 --> 03:29:41,500
Oh my god, he's educated.

3497
03:29:42,020 --> 03:29:42,200
Wow.

3498
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:44,160
Haggling and bartering!

3499
03:29:45,360 --> 03:29:46,460
Hell yeah.

3500
03:29:48,460 --> 03:29:49,480
Let's see this.

3501
03:29:51,220 --> 03:29:53,720
June 1st, 1927.

3502
03:29:54,660 --> 03:29:56,800
Yesterday was the reading of his mother's will.

3503
03:29:57,500 --> 03:30:00,180
Most of the remaining estate went directly to him, of course.

3504
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:04,620
But to my surprise, she bequeathed me her pocket watch.

3505
03:30:06,320 --> 03:30:06,960
Curious.

3506
03:30:06,960 --> 03:30:09,100
I'm not fond of the thing.

3507
03:30:09,660 --> 03:30:12,000
But I know that taking it will mean a lot to him.

3508
03:30:13,080 --> 03:30:18,020
I cannot help but feel it is some veiled jab at me from beyond the grave.

3509
03:30:19,140 --> 03:30:20,940
She was the type to do such a thing.

3510
03:30:21,580 --> 03:30:22,820
Was I late on some occasion?

3511
03:30:23,600 --> 03:30:24,580
I cannot recall.

3512
03:30:26,880 --> 03:30:28,320
This guy is British.

3513
03:30:30,500 --> 03:30:31,900
There's a co-op mod?

3514
03:30:32,020 --> 03:30:32,640
Oh my god.

3515
03:30:32,940 --> 03:30:33,680
That would be crazy.

3516
03:30:33,680 --> 03:30:38,100
I would lead her to every sanity draining mist ever.

3517
03:30:42,580 --> 03:30:43,540
Pocket watch?

3518
03:30:44,260 --> 03:30:45,520
I don't think we got a pocket watch.

3519
03:30:45,520 --> 03:30:47,840
Wait, did we get a pocket watch and sell it?

3520
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:50,080
I don't remember.

3521
03:30:51,740 --> 03:30:53,700
Look at all these fish we got.

3522
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:56,020
We can go sell everything.

3523
03:30:57,480 --> 03:30:58,240
Okay, bye mister!

3524
03:30:58,240 --> 03:31:03,400
The other guy... I can't remember what he wanted.

3525
03:31:09,340 --> 03:31:10,420
It was...

3526
03:31:11,980 --> 03:31:13,380
We'll figure it out.

3527
03:31:15,340 --> 03:31:17,200
Irish pocket watch.

3528
03:31:17,800 --> 03:31:21,520
That doesn't really work as well as the wrist watch.

3529
03:31:24,460 --> 03:31:25,700
And that's 10.

3530
03:31:25,780 --> 03:31:30,260
I think this thing said it could hold up to 10 or catch up to 10 a day or something.

3531
03:31:45,770 --> 03:31:46,270
Fish.

3532
03:31:46,270 --> 03:31:47,450
Sell all fish.

3533
03:31:48,610 --> 03:31:49,110
That's it.

3534
03:31:50,090 --> 03:31:50,590
205.

3535
03:31:51,630 --> 03:31:52,570
You stingy.

3536
03:31:52,770 --> 03:31:54,170
Are you holding out on me mister?

3537
03:32:03,340 --> 03:32:05,140
I could get the engine space.

3538
03:32:06,280 --> 03:32:07,820
We're saving up, right?

3539
03:32:07,960 --> 03:32:11,180
We're going to save up for... Wait, actually I think I can afford it now.

3540
03:32:11,820 --> 03:32:12,420
Barely.

3541
03:32:14,400 --> 03:32:15,240
Let's go.

3542
03:32:15,920 --> 03:32:17,200
Now we're zooming.

3543
03:32:18,540 --> 03:32:20,120
I had repairs?

3544
03:32:20,640 --> 03:32:21,200
On what?

3545
03:32:22,700 --> 03:32:24,680
Wait, repair all to what?

3546
03:32:24,980 --> 03:32:25,860
What's broken?

3547
03:32:28,680 --> 03:32:29,900
Is my net broken?

3548
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:30,760
Oh my net.

3549
03:32:30,760 --> 03:32:30,860
What?

3550
03:32:38,700 --> 03:32:42,220
Shall we go back to...

3551
03:32:46,250 --> 03:32:47,370
Wait, remove.

3552
03:32:48,490 --> 03:32:50,910
Should we go back to...

3553
03:32:50,910 --> 03:32:53,950
The devil's spine and try... Oh, the X marks.

3554
03:32:54,050 --> 03:32:55,270
Is that what you guys were talking about?

3555
03:32:56,330 --> 03:32:58,270
Let's go to the X marks on the spine.

3556
03:33:01,570 --> 03:33:02,990
X marks the spot.

3557
03:33:03,070 --> 03:33:05,070
That's what they say and I'm a pirate now.

3558
03:33:06,090 --> 03:33:07,630
I'm zooming now.

3559
03:33:09,090 --> 03:33:11,050
Don't forget the guy in Gale Cliffs.

3560
03:33:11,610 --> 03:33:13,230
They'll just give me a book too though, right?

3561
03:33:13,630 --> 03:33:14,070
Probably.

3562
03:33:20,170 --> 03:33:20,770
The winds.

3563
03:33:22,990 --> 03:33:24,130
The colorful winds.

3564
03:33:26,010 --> 03:33:27,910
If evil, why pretty?

3565
03:33:29,970 --> 03:33:30,950
Books are cool.

3566
03:33:31,070 --> 03:33:32,550
I gotta finish this one first.

3567
03:33:32,650 --> 03:33:33,110
I'm invested.

3568
03:33:45,660 --> 03:33:46,980
He gives explosives?

3569
03:33:47,260 --> 03:33:48,200
Don't say that.

3570
03:33:49,100 --> 03:33:52,220
Wait, the guy in Gale Cliffs is part of the main quest.

3571
03:33:56,360 --> 03:33:58,380
What guy in Gale Cliffs?

3572
03:33:58,740 --> 03:34:00,340
Wait, did you not say devil's spine?

3573
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:03,200
The one

3574
03:34:09,370 --> 03:34:12,430
he didn't talk to.

3575
03:34:13,370 --> 03:34:17,830
I thought the red X was where I needed the explosives and I can't get in there.

3576
03:34:18,970 --> 03:34:21,150
The whaler guy in Gale Cliffs.

3577
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:22,230
No,

3578
03:34:28,140 --> 03:34:29,100
there's a dock there.

3579
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:39,960
I'm halfway there, you guys.

3580
03:34:40,980 --> 03:34:43,120
I'm halfway to devil's spine.

3581
03:34:45,280 --> 03:34:47,380
But we do need the explosives.

3582
03:34:47,780 --> 03:34:49,200
We actually do need those.

3583
03:34:50,420 --> 03:34:50,820
Utah!

3584
03:34:54,320 --> 03:34:56,780
We do actually need that.

3585
03:34:57,340 --> 03:34:58,320
What are these guys?

3586
03:35:00,100 --> 03:35:01,840
Oh, I need this thing.

3587
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:02,780
Whatever that is.

3588
03:35:07,420 --> 03:35:08,500
Aw, shucks.

3589
03:35:20,640 --> 03:35:22,620
Last location for the main quest.

3590
03:35:25,780 --> 03:35:27,800
I was just going on my own journey.

3591
03:35:27,960 --> 03:35:29,100
I'm speedrunning the game.

3592
03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:34,120
I was speedrunning the game, apparently.

3593
03:35:34,660 --> 03:35:35,980
Trying to, at least.

3594
03:35:36,280 --> 03:35:36,520
What?

3595
03:35:38,220 --> 03:35:41,880
I've been trying to find a way to get explosives this entire time.

3596
03:35:46,320 --> 03:35:47,360
No way.

3597
03:35:59,470 --> 03:36:02,530
Will I lose all the fish if my net breaks before I sell them?

3598
03:36:09,140 --> 03:36:09,660
Alrighty.

3599
03:36:11,620 --> 03:36:14,400
This dock right here...

3600
03:36:15,640 --> 03:36:16,740
Oh my gosh.

3601
03:36:17,060 --> 03:36:17,720
Are you kidding me?

3602
03:36:17,740 --> 03:36:21,680
The guy that I needed to talk to was literally right next to the thing that I needed...

3603
03:36:46,550 --> 03:36:47,070
Sometime.

3604
03:36:47,510 --> 03:36:50,370
Truth be told, I've been reconsidering my position lately.

3605
03:36:51,930 --> 03:36:53,490
I have been happy here for so long.

3606
03:36:53,570 --> 03:36:55,610
My wife and I had such a beautiful life.

3607
03:36:56,050 --> 03:36:57,270
Until the collapse.

3608
03:36:59,110 --> 03:37:00,110
Now I'm alone.

3609
03:37:00,430 --> 03:37:02,570
I'm cut off by land and sea.

3610
03:37:03,090 --> 03:37:06,250
Left only with these trembling rocks on all sides.

3611
03:37:06,530 --> 03:37:08,030
Oh, I can help you move!

3612
03:37:09,430 --> 03:37:10,970
Oh, this groans.

3613
03:37:13,190 --> 03:37:13,710
Ehhh...

3614
03:37:13,710 --> 03:37:14,790
It's not that simple.

3615
03:37:15,150 --> 03:37:16,390
My brother would never.

3616
03:37:16,870 --> 03:37:19,570
You see, I used to live in Ingfeld with my brother.

3617
03:37:19,770 --> 03:37:21,450
He was a whaler back in the day.

3618
03:37:21,890 --> 03:37:22,930
Things were bad.

3619
03:37:23,210 --> 03:37:24,030
We fought a lot.

3620
03:37:24,290 --> 03:37:27,130
Mostly about how our parents' inheritance should be divided.

3621
03:37:27,510 --> 03:37:30,010
We were in the prime foolishness of our youth.

3622
03:37:30,990 --> 03:37:34,910
When my wife and I decided to move here, I took the family crest.

3623
03:37:35,210 --> 03:37:37,130
I stole it from him!

3624
03:37:37,130 --> 03:37:41,130
Now after all this time, I can't return without it.

3625
03:37:41,130 --> 03:37:41,970
Ah, where is it?

3626
03:37:42,390 --> 03:37:43,750
That's where the problem lies.

3627
03:37:44,190 --> 03:37:50,050
After the collapse, that creature, it dragged debris from the houses down into the wretched burrows.

3628
03:37:50,370 --> 03:37:51,730
The crest went down with it.

3629
03:37:51,790 --> 03:37:52,090
Oop!

3630
03:37:53,070 --> 03:37:54,390
Sounds like a you problem.

3631
03:37:55,050 --> 03:37:56,250
It's a lost cause.

3632
03:37:57,370 --> 03:38:00,970
But if you were to find it, it's a large whale bone crest.

3633
03:38:01,150 --> 03:38:02,450
It would mean the world to me.

3634
03:38:02,870 --> 03:38:04,470
Ah, don't get your hopes up, Gramps.

3635
03:38:05,870 --> 03:38:06,750
Oh, ah, woah.

3636
03:38:08,690 --> 03:38:09,050
Hermit!

3637
03:38:10,110 --> 03:38:11,070
Does he not have a name?

3638
03:38:11,690 --> 03:38:13,370
Ah, do you know where I could clear...

3639
03:38:13,370 --> 03:38:16,990
Wait, is that one that I saw in the middle of the little area?

3640
03:38:17,410 --> 03:38:18,250
Already saw it?

3641
03:38:18,270 --> 03:38:20,190
Is that the thing that we saw, probably?

3642
03:38:20,670 --> 03:38:22,790
Do you know how I could clear the debris around here?

3643
03:38:24,090 --> 03:38:26,430
You'd probably need some explosives to shift those rocks.

3644
03:38:26,490 --> 03:38:28,310
My brother at Inkfell used to make explosives.

3645
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:29,950
For the whaling operations, you see.

3646
03:38:30,050 --> 03:38:30,710
Nasty stuff.

3647
03:38:31,070 --> 03:38:33,470
But with the whales all gone, I can't imagine he's still in business.

3648
03:38:33,470 --> 03:38:35,050
What else do you want to know?

3649
03:38:36,670 --> 03:38:38,170
Any shipwrecks around here?

3650
03:38:38,470 --> 03:38:40,230
So he probably gives us the...

3651
03:38:41,050 --> 03:38:43,470
Probably gives us the explosives once we...

3652
03:38:46,070 --> 03:38:48,150
Have our brothers make up.

3653
03:38:49,070 --> 03:38:50,650
Not make out, you guys.

3654
03:38:50,730 --> 03:38:50,970
God.

3655
03:38:51,810 --> 03:38:53,890
Clear the earwax out of your ears.

3656
03:38:59,790 --> 03:39:02,310
Someone that used to live here kept the shop...

3657
03:39:02,310 --> 03:39:04,310
No, the ship moored at the base of the cliff.

3658
03:39:04,310 --> 03:39:07,030
Until it was struck by some falling rocks and sunk to the bottom.

3659
03:39:08,110 --> 03:39:09,690
They were devastated at the loss.

3660
03:39:09,830 --> 03:39:10,410
We all were.

3661
03:39:10,730 --> 03:39:11,790
But it was a beautiful boat.

3662
03:39:12,410 --> 03:39:15,450
Decorated with all manner of memorabilia from their travels.

3663
03:39:17,410 --> 03:39:22,570
At low tide, I can still see what's left of the mast head poking through the waves.

3664
03:39:23,250 --> 03:39:24,210
What else do you want to know?

3665
03:39:25,370 --> 03:39:26,830
What's happening to these cliffs?

3666
03:39:27,310 --> 03:39:30,610
They're being consumed from the core by that hateful serpent.

3667
03:39:31,030 --> 03:39:31,650
Have you seen it?

3668
03:39:32,090 --> 03:39:32,890
That thing?

3669
03:39:32,890 --> 03:39:34,390
Nobody believed me.

3670
03:39:34,630 --> 03:39:36,810
Not until he started devouring our foundations.

3671
03:39:36,930 --> 03:39:38,030
He eats rocks?

3672
03:39:38,650 --> 03:39:39,410
He's just a...

3673
03:39:39,410 --> 03:39:40,450
He's just a...

3674
03:39:40,450 --> 03:39:42,670
A fish that eats rocks?

3675
03:39:47,950 --> 03:39:50,430
Opening up chasms beneath our homes.

3676
03:39:51,350 --> 03:39:52,530
Rock and stared.

3677
03:39:53,290 --> 03:39:54,270
It was nightmarish.

3678
03:39:54,370 --> 03:39:57,630
Waking up in the night to the sound of a creature slithering somewhere underneath.

3679
03:39:58,270 --> 03:40:00,290
It seems to have turned its attention elsewhere.

3680
03:40:00,290 --> 03:40:02,350
But not before it took everything from me.

3681
03:40:05,990 --> 03:40:07,610
Tell me more about the creature that lives in the cliffs.

3682
03:40:08,030 --> 03:40:10,210
It's been burrowing tunnels through the base of the cliffs.

3683
03:40:11,390 --> 03:40:14,470
You can see the gigantic holes it leaves just below the surface.

3684
03:40:16,250 --> 03:40:19,490
As it forces its way out, it often causes rock falls.

3685
03:40:19,610 --> 03:40:21,610
So if you plan on going in there, keep an ear out.

3686
03:40:22,390 --> 03:40:25,290
Should it catch sight of you, well, you should be able to outrun it.

3687
03:40:25,350 --> 03:40:26,670
It's quite... it's not slow!

3688
03:40:28,450 --> 03:40:30,810
Provided you can navigate the passageways.

3689
03:40:34,450 --> 03:40:35,570
Slow where?

3690
03:40:40,910 --> 03:40:43,010
Now I have haste?

3691
03:40:43,070 --> 03:40:43,670
It's true.

3692
03:40:44,390 --> 03:40:46,450
I do have... I do have better speed now.

3693
03:40:46,930 --> 03:40:48,690
We're stronger than we were before.

3694
03:40:49,710 --> 03:40:52,170
If I go talk to the brother...

3695
03:40:52,170 --> 03:40:53,810
Can I go talk to a brother?

3696
03:40:53,810 --> 03:40:57,090
If I go talk to the brother...

3697
03:40:57,090 --> 03:40:58,270
Will he give me more?

3698
03:40:58,970 --> 03:41:00,350
Will he give me explosives?

3699
03:41:07,200 --> 03:41:08,540
Oh, that's wrong.

3700
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:11,100
Hello, retired whaler.

3701
03:41:11,660 --> 03:41:12,740
I heard you make explosives.

3702
03:41:13,360 --> 03:41:14,140
Aye, I did.

3703
03:41:14,520 --> 03:41:16,400
Sometimes the carcasses needed breaking up.

3704
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:20,320
It wasn't the most efficient or the most pleasant, but it got the job done.

3705
03:41:20,880 --> 03:41:22,500
I've been thinking about getting back into it.

3706
03:41:22,760 --> 03:41:26,820
I might be able to rustle up something strong enough to clear those debris piles in the cliffs.

3707
03:41:26,820 --> 03:41:28,560
Ah, but I'm not sure.

3708
03:41:28,880 --> 03:41:30,160
I don't have the energy these days.

3709
03:41:30,920 --> 03:41:32,760
I'd have a use for explosives like that.

3710
03:41:33,360 --> 03:41:35,600
I'll think on it some more, but I make no promises.

3711
03:41:37,960 --> 03:41:39,360
Fickle old man.

3712
03:41:39,720 --> 03:41:40,100
Alright.

3713
03:41:43,140 --> 03:41:44,320
I'm just gonna go this way.

3714
03:41:44,900 --> 03:41:46,340
Since I've already committed.

3715
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:49,500
We're gonna go get some stuff.

3716
03:41:51,180 --> 03:41:52,780
We're gonna go inside.

3717
03:41:54,840 --> 03:41:55,360
Probably.

3718
03:41:59,960 --> 03:42:00,440
And...

3719
03:42:00,440 --> 03:42:02,560
We're gonna get the crest, probably.

3720
03:42:03,500 --> 03:42:04,340
Brave Minky.

3721
03:42:05,140 --> 03:42:06,820
I'm not the...

3722
03:42:12,240 --> 03:42:13,200
I think...

3723
03:42:13,200 --> 03:42:14,800
Is that the guy coming after me?

3724
03:42:16,640 --> 03:42:18,500
That's 100% the guy coming after me.

3725
03:42:22,740 --> 03:42:25,460
If I go in here, I don't know if there's a way out.

3726
03:42:25,880 --> 03:42:27,700
But we're just gonna try.

3727
03:42:31,140 --> 03:42:32,520
Wait, do I have to dredge this?

3728
03:42:34,500 --> 03:42:35,260
Oh shoot.

3729
03:42:35,820 --> 03:42:37,000
And he's like right here, isn't he?

3730
03:42:38,400 --> 03:42:39,220
No he's not.

3731
03:42:40,420 --> 03:42:41,120
Maybe we're fine.

3732
03:43:15,730 --> 03:43:16,690
Evil game.

3733
03:43:17,710 --> 03:43:18,790
In and out.

3734
03:43:18,790 --> 03:43:21,110
I thought he was gonna chase me in there.

3735
03:43:21,230 --> 03:43:22,790
Oh thank goodness he didn't.

3736
03:43:24,500 --> 03:43:26,890
The ocean tribe is like...

3737
03:43:26,890 --> 03:43:30,470
Not so fast.

3738
03:43:35,710 --> 03:43:36,410
Nice.

3739
03:43:37,110 --> 03:43:37,810
What did we get?

3740
03:43:41,510 --> 03:43:42,910
We got...

3741
03:43:42,910 --> 03:43:47,390
5% increased sell prices and 5% reduced buy prices.

3742
03:43:47,390 --> 03:43:49,030
That's big.

3743
03:43:49,650 --> 03:43:51,350
Especially because we're about to sell stuff.

3744
03:43:55,930 --> 03:43:58,030
That thing was not slow at all though.

3745
03:43:58,350 --> 03:43:58,930
Excuse me?

3746
03:44:02,710 --> 03:44:04,130
The old man is insane.

3747
03:44:07,790 --> 03:44:10,150
151 fish in our net.

3748
03:44:10,350 --> 03:44:10,850
Not bad.

3749
03:44:12,550 --> 03:44:15,210
I only have 168 dollars though.

3750
03:44:15,550 --> 03:44:16,410
Not good.

3751
03:44:21,150 --> 03:44:23,010
And I'm going to...

3752
03:44:29,970 --> 03:44:32,010
I'm going to repair...

3753
03:44:33,170 --> 03:44:34,110
Our thing.

3754
03:44:35,210 --> 03:44:36,350
Yeah, we'll fix the net.

3755
03:44:36,890 --> 03:44:38,250
I got it guys, I got it.

3756
03:44:38,270 --> 03:44:38,850
Don't worry.

3757
03:44:39,470 --> 03:44:41,210
I'm fixing it, I'm fixing it.

3758
03:44:48,020 --> 03:44:48,920
More wood.

3759
03:44:51,280 --> 03:44:52,500
One scrap.

3760
03:44:53,260 --> 03:44:54,220
Three cloth.

3761
03:44:54,640 --> 03:44:55,900
And two fancy metals.

3762
03:44:56,100 --> 03:44:57,480
800 dollars.

3763
03:45:00,980 --> 03:45:01,720
Expensive.

3764
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:04,160
Alright, let's go to Gramps.

3765
03:45:12,950 --> 03:45:13,690
Grandpa!

3766
03:45:15,970 --> 03:45:16,710
Grandpa!

3767
03:45:23,280 --> 03:45:25,220
Hello again, what can I do for you?

3768
03:45:25,540 --> 03:45:26,760
Is this your family crest?

3769
03:45:26,760 --> 03:45:27,880
You found it!

3770
03:45:28,180 --> 03:45:29,860
I never thought I'd see this beauty again.

3771
03:45:29,940 --> 03:45:31,620
And I found it in like two seconds, Grandpa.

3772
03:45:32,860 --> 03:45:34,520
Now I have a further favor to ask.

3773
03:45:34,840 --> 03:45:36,540
Would you take this to my brother at Ingfeld?

3774
03:45:37,100 --> 03:45:37,940
Tell him...

3775
03:45:37,940 --> 03:45:40,380
Tell him his brother is sorry and would like to come home.

3776
03:45:41,880 --> 03:45:42,320
Okay.

3777
03:45:45,940 --> 03:45:46,820
Turn around.

3778
03:45:55,220 --> 03:45:55,660
Wait.

3779
03:45:57,060 --> 03:45:58,300
That thing was there.

3780
03:45:59,560 --> 03:46:00,400
I saw a shiny.

3781
03:46:02,260 --> 03:46:03,620
I see a shiny!

3782
03:46:04,360 --> 03:46:05,260
Should I go get it?

3783
03:46:08,320 --> 03:46:09,320
Let's aim for shiny.

3784
03:46:21,080 --> 03:46:21,980
Stonefish.

3785
03:46:27,010 --> 03:46:28,360
What the?

3786
03:46:33,030 --> 03:46:34,320
More stonefish.

3787
03:46:35,420 --> 03:46:36,500
Where's our creepy guy?

3788
03:46:39,320 --> 03:46:39,660
Oh!

3789
03:46:43,360 --> 03:46:44,480
Enthralled stonefish.

3790
03:46:44,580 --> 03:46:45,020
Nasty.

3791
03:46:47,500 --> 03:46:47,820
Okay.

3792
03:46:53,840 --> 03:46:54,700
I'm talking.

3793
03:46:56,740 --> 03:46:58,060
There's your creepy guy.

3794
03:46:59,900 --> 03:47:01,180
What is it?

3795
03:47:01,440 --> 03:47:03,320
I believe this crest is yours.

3796
03:47:03,840 --> 03:47:05,880
Gods, I haven't seen this since...

3797
03:47:05,880 --> 03:47:07,740
So he did take it.

3798
03:47:07,880 --> 03:47:08,680
I knew it.

3799
03:47:10,080 --> 03:47:11,060
Your brother is sorry.

3800
03:47:11,160 --> 03:47:12,100
Will you let him come home?

3801
03:47:12,520 --> 03:47:13,360
I don't know.

3802
03:47:13,480 --> 03:47:15,860
I was in a right state when he left.

3803
03:47:16,320 --> 03:47:17,120
Okay, fine.

3804
03:47:17,220 --> 03:47:18,680
He can stay in my old workshop.

3805
03:47:18,900 --> 03:47:20,080
At least for the time being.

3806
03:47:20,520 --> 03:47:21,940
But I'll need some time to clear it out.

3807
03:47:22,340 --> 03:47:24,360
While I'm doing that, perhaps you can do something for me.

3808
03:47:24,980 --> 03:47:28,940
See, I've been trying to clear some debris in the pathways through the cliffs to make a shortcut.

3809
03:47:29,280 --> 03:47:30,000
With explosives.

3810
03:47:30,940 --> 03:47:34,740
I was able to set a charge, but the cliffs seemed particularly unsteady that day.

3811
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:36,880
So I didn't risk detonating it.

3812
03:47:37,180 --> 03:47:38,720
You just need to get there and set it off.

3813
03:47:39,060 --> 03:47:39,820
It's not far in.

3814
03:47:39,820 --> 03:47:41,340
I left some yellow flags nearby.

3815
03:47:41,480 --> 03:47:42,740
You can't miss it.

3816
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:43,900
Okay.

3817
03:47:45,240 --> 03:47:45,700
Woohoo!

3818
03:47:46,580 --> 03:47:47,040
Explosives!

3819
03:47:50,860 --> 03:47:51,320
Explosives!

3820
03:47:52,040 --> 03:47:52,280
Uh oh.

3821
03:47:52,700 --> 03:47:53,300
Freaky fog.

3822
03:47:54,600 --> 03:47:56,280
This is gonna make me freaky.

3823
03:47:57,040 --> 03:47:57,500
Oh god.

3824
03:47:57,740 --> 03:47:58,860
I think we need to sleep.

3825
03:47:58,960 --> 03:47:59,280
For real.

3826
03:48:00,140 --> 03:48:01,340
I think I need to go to sleep.

3827
03:48:05,420 --> 03:48:08,260
Would you like to buy this enthralled stonefish?

3828
03:48:16,860 --> 03:48:18,860
Good morning, Minto.

3829
03:48:19,160 --> 03:48:23,780
We are completely sane in the mind and body.

3830
03:48:26,620 --> 03:48:28,240
Yellow flags?

3831
03:48:28,860 --> 03:48:30,100
See, like there's this.

3832
03:48:30,620 --> 03:48:32,220
But I don't see any yellow flags.

3833
03:48:34,660 --> 03:48:35,620
Okay.

3834
03:48:36,400 --> 03:48:37,620
Yellow flags.

3835
03:48:41,060 --> 03:48:42,740
Oh, it's like inside.

3836
03:48:48,900 --> 03:48:50,260
Like in there?

3837
03:48:50,820 --> 03:48:51,780
Mister, are you crazy?

3838
03:48:53,060 --> 03:48:54,560
Trying to get me killed, mister?

3839
03:49:07,660 --> 03:49:08,920
I hear him.

3840
03:49:11,480 --> 03:49:13,440
While loose debris...

3841
03:49:29,110 --> 03:49:30,750
He was like...

3842
03:49:34,090 --> 03:49:35,450
He just...

3843
03:49:35,450 --> 03:49:36,690
Oh man.

3844
03:49:38,210 --> 03:49:39,970
He came and bit me and left.

3845
03:49:40,510 --> 03:49:41,710
Just a little love bite.

3846
03:49:41,710 --> 03:49:43,330
Oh la la.

3847
03:49:48,830 --> 03:49:51,070
The winds speak of something mysterious.

3848
03:49:53,110 --> 03:49:53,750
Where?

3849
03:49:54,770 --> 03:49:55,230
What?

3850
03:49:55,390 --> 03:49:55,830
The wood.

3851
03:49:56,330 --> 03:49:57,850
Is it the wood you seek?

3852
03:49:58,950 --> 03:50:00,590
No, it's beyond the wood.

3853
03:50:03,870 --> 03:50:05,130
Alright, let's go talk.

3854
03:50:05,290 --> 03:50:06,210
Let's go tell grandpa.

3855
03:50:07,110 --> 03:50:07,930
Everything's fine.

3856
03:50:08,910 --> 03:50:09,510
Oh.

3857
03:50:14,830 --> 03:50:16,030
September 9th.

3858
03:50:16,050 --> 03:50:18,890
Wait, I wonder if this is a continuation of the other one.

3859
03:50:23,170 --> 03:50:24,150
Because we had what?

3860
03:50:24,310 --> 03:50:25,270
Oh, come on.

3861
03:50:31,130 --> 03:50:33,570
We had September...

3862
03:50:33,570 --> 03:50:34,890
Another September one.

3863
03:50:37,050 --> 03:50:37,990
In fact.

3864
03:50:42,390 --> 03:50:45,090
He still refuses to take me aboard when he is working.

3865
03:50:45,370 --> 03:50:50,150
He is convinced that I will find it dull, or that the crew will be crass or otherwise intolerable.

3866
03:50:50,650 --> 03:50:52,150
Perhaps I'm being overly needy.

3867
03:50:52,430 --> 03:50:56,750
I know he needs time alone, but I am so desperately bored at home when he is away.

3868
03:50:57,170 --> 03:51:00,170
He recently installed some salvaging equipment onto the boat.

3869
03:51:00,590 --> 03:51:03,830
I think the idea of pulling up treasure is terribly exciting.

3870
03:51:04,250 --> 03:51:07,010
I must convince him to let me have a go.

3871
03:51:07,850 --> 03:51:09,470
Let our lady fish.

3872
03:51:13,210 --> 03:51:14,790
She yearns for the net.

3873
03:51:19,470 --> 03:51:20,330
You've done it.

3874
03:51:20,430 --> 03:51:21,710
We heard the blast from here.

3875
03:51:22,130 --> 03:51:23,030
Gods, the echo.

3876
03:51:23,450 --> 03:51:25,410
I'm surprised the cliffs didn't come down on your head.

3877
03:51:26,310 --> 03:51:27,350
I've got things ready here.

3878
03:51:27,550 --> 03:51:29,470
Go and tell my brother that he can come home.

3879
03:51:30,990 --> 03:51:31,390
Okay.

3880
03:51:32,050 --> 03:51:32,550
Oh my gosh.

3881
03:51:32,730 --> 03:51:34,410
So I undock, I dock.

3882
03:51:34,490 --> 03:51:37,510
Do you guys know how much time it takes to dock a boat?

3883
03:51:46,580 --> 03:51:48,240
Playing a game two times in one week?

3884
03:51:48,320 --> 03:51:48,980
What are you, doki?

3885
03:51:54,770 --> 03:51:57,630
Wait until I play the same game over and over again.

3886
03:51:58,490 --> 03:51:59,590
Your brother forgives you.

3887
03:51:59,970 --> 03:52:01,010
He found you a place to stay.

3888
03:52:02,090 --> 03:52:02,550
He does?

3889
03:52:02,650 --> 03:52:04,610
That's a huge weight off my chest.

3890
03:52:05,010 --> 03:52:07,630
When so old, I hardly remembered it was there.

3891
03:52:08,390 --> 03:52:10,250
Right, well I'm packed and ready to go.

3892
03:52:11,110 --> 03:52:15,570
I can't get over the fact that we put these people in our cargo.

3893
03:52:17,650 --> 03:52:19,090
Alright, mister.

3894
03:52:24,260 --> 03:52:24,960
This way.

3895
03:52:35,820 --> 03:52:37,540
This won't end badly.

3896
03:52:39,440 --> 03:52:40,460
It's fine.

3897
03:52:40,640 --> 03:52:41,580
Well here we are.

3898
03:52:41,920 --> 03:52:43,040
What if he gets shot?

3899
03:52:43,080 --> 03:52:44,840
What if the guy shoots him immediately though?

3900
03:52:44,900 --> 03:52:45,520
That'd be crazy.

3901
03:52:45,980 --> 03:52:49,060
The hermit notices the old whaler standing on the dock waiting for him.

3902
03:52:51,020 --> 03:52:53,260
Oh my gosh, it's his ototo.

3903
03:52:54,060 --> 03:52:56,140
Little brother, you're home.

3904
03:52:57,480 --> 03:52:58,220
I'm so sorry.

3905
03:52:58,660 --> 03:52:59,720
I was so foolish.

3906
03:53:00,440 --> 03:53:01,120
We both were.

3907
03:53:01,600 --> 03:53:02,440
Come on inside.

3908
03:53:02,820 --> 03:53:03,740
Let me get your bags.

3909
03:53:04,420 --> 03:53:06,620
The two brothers walk away down the dock.

3910
03:53:07,020 --> 03:53:09,100
One of them pauses for a moment and turns back to you.

3911
03:53:10,460 --> 03:53:11,300
Oh, stranger.

3912
03:53:12,160 --> 03:53:17,040
If you find any more debris that needs clearing, I'm working on making some more packed explosives.

3913
03:53:17,600 --> 03:53:19,560
Come by the old whaling yard anytime.

3914
03:53:20,260 --> 03:53:21,300
Whaling yard!

3915
03:53:23,300 --> 03:53:24,640
This is free, right?

3916
03:53:25,260 --> 03:53:26,060
Packed explosives?

3917
03:53:27,480 --> 03:53:30,280
I hope you can put it to good use wherever you find cars.

3918
03:53:30,420 --> 03:53:31,980
Oh, more packs!

3919
03:53:32,160 --> 03:53:33,160
There's a lot of them.

3920
03:53:35,360 --> 03:53:36,560
Oh the first one is free?

3921
03:53:36,960 --> 03:53:39,600
Come on mister, I just reunited you with your...

3922
03:53:39,600 --> 03:53:40,220
brother.

3923
03:53:41,180 --> 03:53:42,900
Your brother of all time.

3924
03:53:43,700 --> 03:53:44,700
Please mister.

3925
03:53:45,160 --> 03:53:46,880
Please, everybody's...

3926
03:53:48,180 --> 03:53:50,880
Can't I be the only customer that gets them for free?

3927
03:53:55,000 --> 03:53:56,620
He always wanted a brother.

3928
03:53:59,220 --> 03:54:00,740
Use explosives.

3929
03:54:01,580 --> 03:54:02,240
Light the fuse.

3930
03:54:03,100 --> 03:54:04,820
The debris crumbles away.

3931
03:54:06,280 --> 03:54:07,460
He always wanted a brother.

3932
03:54:08,100 --> 03:54:09,300
He always wanted a brother.

3933
03:54:15,650 --> 03:54:17,110
Sapphire earrings.

3934
03:54:17,390 --> 03:54:17,730
Nice.

3935
03:54:19,490 --> 03:54:20,730
And this.

3936
03:54:21,050 --> 03:54:21,890
Oh my gosh.

3937
03:54:22,150 --> 03:54:23,910
What could it be?

3938
03:54:23,910 --> 03:54:24,010
What could it be?

3939
03:54:32,740 --> 03:54:39,440
Since you're so obsessed with me, can you help me decide whether or not to acquire a ten foot orca plushie that is a thousand bucks?

3940
03:54:39,940 --> 03:54:40,420
Orca!

3941
03:54:40,700 --> 03:54:40,980
No!

3942
03:54:46,130 --> 03:54:49,110
Orca, as your financial advisor, I must tell you.

3943
03:54:50,810 --> 03:54:52,990
Don't buy the ten foot orca.

3944
03:54:52,990 --> 03:54:53,350
Ten foot.

3945
03:54:56,870 --> 03:54:59,850
You couldn't even take it with you to things.

3946
03:55:00,010 --> 03:55:03,790
Or you could, but you wouldn't be able to take it on a ship or anything.

3947
03:55:04,130 --> 03:55:06,410
Oh gosh, I have boats on the brain, that's all I can think about.

3948
03:55:07,690 --> 03:55:08,050
Uh oh.

3949
03:55:10,090 --> 03:55:10,950
Let's go to sleep.

3950
03:55:20,800 --> 03:55:21,120
You...

3951
03:55:21,640 --> 03:55:24,420
If you try to take it to an event, that's like...

3952
03:55:24,420 --> 03:55:26,180
You have to travel by flight?

3953
03:55:26,400 --> 03:55:27,120
What's the point?

3954
03:55:27,120 --> 03:55:27,520
Dang it.

3955
03:55:28,860 --> 03:55:29,920
What a steal.

3956
03:55:30,860 --> 03:55:32,240
Stop, you guys!

3957
03:55:32,340 --> 03:55:33,460
You're such bad influences.

3958
03:55:44,940 --> 03:55:47,340
I'm selling my stuff.

3959
03:55:50,380 --> 03:55:52,380
It's like a hundred dollars per foot.

3960
03:55:56,340 --> 03:55:58,300
Sell all fish.

3961
03:55:58,720 --> 03:55:59,020
Alright.

3962
03:56:00,840 --> 03:56:01,520
Goodbye!

3963
03:56:01,520 --> 03:56:01,880
Goodbye!

3964
03:56:04,280 --> 03:56:06,120
The collector is this way.

3965
03:56:16,880 --> 03:56:18,760
I think it should be even more expensive.

3966
03:56:18,960 --> 03:56:20,240
I think it should be 10k.

3967
03:56:22,140 --> 03:56:23,700
That's just my personal opinion.

3968
03:56:26,520 --> 03:56:28,540
Big money, big money, big money.

3969
03:56:29,300 --> 03:56:30,660
Damn it, this thing...

3970
03:56:32,420 --> 03:56:33,020
What?

3971
03:56:33,760 --> 03:56:34,240
What?

3972
03:56:40,600 --> 03:56:41,080
Tetris.

3973
03:56:41,200 --> 03:56:41,980
Get Tetris.

3974
03:56:46,520 --> 03:56:47,380
An investment?

3975
03:56:47,540 --> 03:56:49,340
Everybody would know that it's...

3976
03:56:49,340 --> 03:56:51,320
Actually, maybe you do get it.

3977
03:57:00,820 --> 03:57:02,000
Maybe you do get it.

3978
03:57:08,130 --> 03:57:09,250
We need a bigger boat.

3979
03:57:09,350 --> 03:57:11,210
It's time for the boat.

3980
03:57:11,370 --> 03:57:13,790
We need the third boat upgrade.

3981
03:57:14,890 --> 03:57:15,750
Hello, mister.

3982
03:57:16,030 --> 03:57:17,690
It's been a really long time.

3983
03:57:17,950 --> 03:57:19,270
It's been like a whole year.

3984
03:57:19,710 --> 03:57:20,890
Sorry I've been gone.

3985
03:57:22,670 --> 03:57:23,990
So you've returned.

3986
03:57:24,250 --> 03:57:25,610
I wasn't sure you were coming back.

3987
03:57:25,650 --> 03:57:26,190
Me neither.

3988
03:57:27,150 --> 03:57:29,390
You drag the massive music box into the room.

3989
03:57:30,270 --> 03:57:32,350
Gouging the wooden floorboards beneath it.

3990
03:57:32,870 --> 03:57:34,290
The collector doesn't seem to mind.

3991
03:57:34,490 --> 03:57:35,630
He's focused on the box.

3992
03:57:37,310 --> 03:57:38,650
Surrender the music box.

3993
03:57:39,250 --> 03:57:40,750
You found this at the cliffs, didn't you?

3994
03:57:41,250 --> 03:57:41,730
Yes.

3995
03:57:42,270 --> 03:57:42,990
Ah, excellent.

3996
03:57:43,490 --> 03:57:46,650
This should make future return journeys a little more swift.

3997
03:57:47,130 --> 03:57:47,710
Allow me.

3998
03:57:48,570 --> 03:57:54,390
He selects one of the silver ribbons trailing from the crimson-bound book, opening it to some unseen page.

3999
03:57:54,630 --> 03:57:55,910
Wait, yeah, did we get a new power?

4000
03:57:56,490 --> 03:57:59,810
Turning to catch the dim light, he whispers the words on the page.

4001
03:58:01,430 --> 03:58:06,130
After a few seconds, you feel your stomach drop suddenly, as though thrown high by a wave.

4002
03:58:06,390 --> 03:58:09,190
He closes the book and turns his attention back to you.

4003
03:58:11,190 --> 03:58:11,630
Manifest.

4004
03:58:18,780 --> 03:58:22,240
The reef at Stellar Basin may have caught and accumulated some wreckage.

4005
03:58:22,600 --> 03:58:23,560
Search around that area.

4006
03:58:24,640 --> 03:58:25,920
I'll mark a location on your map.

4007
03:58:27,120 --> 03:58:27,820
Anything else?

4008
03:58:28,660 --> 03:58:30,260
What did you do to me?

4009
03:58:31,600 --> 03:58:33,520
The book holds power from the deep.

4010
03:58:33,780 --> 03:58:35,380
I merely extended it to you.

4011
03:58:36,060 --> 03:58:36,500
Manifest.

4012
03:58:36,720 --> 03:58:41,540
Use of these words will induce a trance-like state.

4013
03:58:41,740 --> 03:58:44,040
While in this state, time will pass in the blink of an eye.

4014
03:58:44,040 --> 03:58:46,360
When it is over, you will find yourself here.

4015
03:58:46,980 --> 03:58:48,920
As always, I caution against overusing this.

4016
03:58:49,060 --> 03:58:51,860
Selectively and strategically utilize it when you need it the most.

4017
03:58:54,820 --> 03:58:55,220
Interesting.

4018
03:58:56,260 --> 03:58:58,600
What are you going to do with these relics?

4019
03:58:59,280 --> 03:59:00,700
Why, collecting them, of course.

4020
03:59:00,760 --> 03:59:02,400
An investment for times to come.

4021
03:59:04,320 --> 03:59:05,880
Will it, like, kill all my fish?

4022
03:59:07,780 --> 03:59:10,000
Where should I... Oh, I know where to look for them.

4023
03:59:10,160 --> 03:59:11,360
Oh, why can't you search for them?

4024
03:59:11,360 --> 03:59:14,300
The ocean no longer wishes to cooperate.

4025
03:59:14,980 --> 03:59:18,200
As the waves are unsafe for me, you will be my surrogate.

4026
03:59:19,340 --> 03:59:19,900
Weird.

4027
03:59:20,920 --> 03:59:21,480
Weird.

4028
03:59:22,520 --> 03:59:23,500
Let's take a look at these trinkets.

4029
03:59:24,720 --> 03:59:25,380
Oh, okay.

4030
03:59:26,060 --> 03:59:27,440
He doesn't want my junk.

4031
03:59:29,040 --> 03:59:30,160
Zero downsides!

4032
03:59:30,980 --> 03:59:32,100
That's huge!

4033
03:59:33,640 --> 03:59:36,300
So now we say to go to Stellar Basin.

4034
03:59:38,280 --> 03:59:39,700
Which we tried before.

4035
03:59:40,720 --> 03:59:42,040
And we shall try again.

4036
03:59:44,420 --> 03:59:46,680
But before that...

4037
03:59:46,680 --> 03:59:48,960
I want to start gathering some supplies again.

4038
03:59:49,060 --> 03:59:50,880
Such as, like, wood and scrap.

4039
03:59:51,680 --> 03:59:53,700
I want to get us ready for...

4040
03:59:54,840 --> 03:59:56,500
I know I saw some wood over here.

4041
03:59:57,020 --> 03:59:58,700
I want to start getting us ready for...

4042
04:00:00,920 --> 04:00:02,700
When we upgrade our ship.

4043
04:00:11,410 --> 04:00:13,310
Since that will come before we know it.

4044
04:00:18,670 --> 04:00:19,230
Hold on.

4045
04:00:23,550 --> 04:00:24,470
I think...

4046
04:00:29,040 --> 04:00:29,960
I think...

4047
04:00:29,960 --> 04:00:31,760
I have... Do I have trinkets?

4048
04:00:31,900 --> 04:00:32,660
Oh yeah, I do.

4049
04:00:33,680 --> 04:00:34,420
Sell all.

4050
04:00:35,000 --> 04:00:36,360
Alright, 46 bucks.

4051
04:00:36,460 --> 04:00:36,820
Let's go.

4052
04:00:38,980 --> 04:00:40,280
What do we need for hole 2?

4053
04:00:41,920 --> 04:00:42,760
You mean hole 3?

4054
04:00:44,140 --> 04:00:45,180
Quite a bit, actually.

4055
04:00:47,660 --> 04:00:49,580
We still need quite...

4056
04:00:49,580 --> 04:00:51,120
It's a lot of money, mostly.

4057
04:00:52,160 --> 04:00:54,400
It's mostly the cash.

4058
04:00:57,860 --> 04:00:58,320
But...

4059
04:00:58,320 --> 04:00:58,940
Oh!

4060
04:00:59,260 --> 04:01:02,140
The lighthouse keeper is waiting for you on the dock, looking displeased.

4061
04:01:03,180 --> 04:01:06,960
I saw you sailing out towards the horizon, crossing that deep expanse.

4062
04:01:07,380 --> 04:01:08,980
Do you really think that's wise?

4063
04:01:09,480 --> 04:01:11,000
I've been doing this everyday, lady.

4064
04:01:11,060 --> 04:01:11,780
It was fine.

4065
04:01:12,220 --> 04:01:12,940
Maybe this time.

4066
04:01:13,320 --> 04:01:14,320
You need to be more careful.

4067
04:01:14,680 --> 04:01:17,540
Even you, with all your experience, cannot truly know the ocean.

4068
04:01:18,060 --> 04:01:19,000
Nobody can.

4069
04:01:20,380 --> 04:01:21,900
I gotta upgrade my engine first?

4070
04:01:21,980 --> 04:01:22,260
Really?

4071
04:01:23,240 --> 04:01:24,340
Abruptly, she walks away.

4072
04:01:24,400 --> 04:01:26,720
Her eyes scan the water as she walks along the dock.

4073
04:01:28,200 --> 04:01:28,600
Oh yeah.

4074
04:01:29,720 --> 04:01:31,240
Does the mayor got anything for me?

4075
04:01:38,860 --> 04:01:39,800
Sell my fish.

4076
04:01:41,220 --> 04:01:43,240
Alright, we're already at 500, though.

4077
04:01:43,580 --> 04:01:44,980
Not bad, not bad.

4078
04:01:46,320 --> 04:01:46,800
Cause...

4079
04:01:46,800 --> 04:01:49,040
I still need to do the engine space.

4080
04:01:49,040 --> 04:01:50,400
And then the hull.

4081
04:01:55,140 --> 04:01:57,420
You guys say upgrade the engine, but...

4082
04:01:59,660 --> 04:02:00,720
To what?

4083
04:02:02,460 --> 04:02:03,140
Like...

4084
04:02:03,140 --> 04:02:04,900
I have no research parts.

4085
04:02:05,260 --> 04:02:07,640
So I can't really do anything there.

4086
04:02:07,760 --> 04:02:09,120
Unless you mean like...

4087
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:11,780
Buying the rest of the jet drive engines.

4088
04:02:15,540 --> 04:02:16,680
My storage.

4089
04:02:17,520 --> 04:02:18,480
This is 15.

4090
04:02:18,740 --> 04:02:19,900
I could uninstall it.

4091
04:02:22,320 --> 04:02:23,240
Oh my gosh!

4092
04:02:23,320 --> 04:02:24,980
I forgot to sell this!

4093
04:02:27,560 --> 04:02:29,120
Let's go sell it.

4094
04:02:42,440 --> 04:02:42,960
Speed.

4095
04:02:46,260 --> 04:02:47,280
That's so crazy.

4096
04:02:48,220 --> 04:02:49,080
Oh, we can just do that.

4097
04:02:49,760 --> 04:02:50,660
Magic fish.

4098
04:02:57,840 --> 04:03:00,760
That guy is crazy looking.

4099
04:03:01,800 --> 04:03:03,140
Wait, what is this thing?

4100
04:03:06,300 --> 04:03:09,440
Deplete a total of 25 fishing spots.

4101
04:03:09,620 --> 04:03:10,080
Fun.

4102
04:03:12,300 --> 04:03:13,780
Guy is a winner.

4103
04:03:14,800 --> 04:03:16,020
Chicken dinner.

4104
04:03:19,660 --> 04:03:20,260
Trader.

4105
04:03:21,940 --> 04:03:22,540
Trader.

4106
04:03:24,040 --> 04:03:24,540
Sell.

4107
04:03:25,740 --> 04:03:27,760
Alright, now we go...

4108
04:03:27,760 --> 04:03:29,780
Actually, let's go to my storage.

4109
04:03:29,880 --> 04:03:31,160
Let's throw these in storage.

4110
04:03:32,120 --> 04:03:33,780
I do have to also do repairs.

4111
04:03:35,400 --> 04:03:36,300
So we'll...

4112
04:03:36,600 --> 04:03:37,200
Go back.

4113
04:03:38,180 --> 04:03:39,320
Maybe I will buy stuff.

4114
04:03:39,780 --> 04:03:41,820
Buy like a new part for the engine.

4115
04:03:51,870 --> 04:03:53,800
And then we'll head back to...

4116
04:03:54,710 --> 04:03:56,670
Wherever the heck that guy told us to go.

4117
04:04:02,410 --> 04:04:02,910
164!

4118
04:04:03,730 --> 04:04:04,230
Nice!

4119
04:04:05,030 --> 04:04:06,030
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4120
04:04:06,130 --> 04:04:06,370
Wait.

4121
04:04:07,330 --> 04:04:08,730
We almost have enough money.

4122
04:04:09,590 --> 04:04:11,210
I mean, I still have to buy this thing.

4123
04:04:11,310 --> 04:04:11,930
But still!

4124
04:04:12,290 --> 04:04:12,790
Crazy.

4125
04:04:14,730 --> 04:04:15,010
Okay.

4126
04:04:15,570 --> 04:04:17,110
What if...

4127
04:04:17,750 --> 04:04:19,110
How much is this?

4128
04:04:19,690 --> 04:04:23,190
$2.55 I could buy two of them.

4129
04:04:30,940 --> 04:04:33,640
Oh my gosh, my repair is $108!

4130
04:04:34,900 --> 04:04:36,080
It's so expensive!

4131
04:05:11,440 --> 04:05:13,780
We can also get one more space.

4132
04:05:14,300 --> 04:05:16,320
Which I have to get anyway, so I'm just gonna get it.

4133
04:05:18,960 --> 04:05:22,140
I was saving it just so that in case we...

4134
04:05:22,140 --> 04:05:25,620
Wanted this for fish, but...

4135
04:05:25,620 --> 04:05:27,460
We're just getting more jets.

4136
04:05:29,300 --> 04:05:30,960
We're getting more jets, baby!

4137
04:05:31,720 --> 04:05:34,200
But I can't afford it right now, so...

4138
04:05:34,200 --> 04:05:36,980
Before we go, I'm going to fish.

4139
04:05:41,390 --> 04:05:43,310
I'm gonna go find maybe...

4140
04:05:43,310 --> 04:05:44,790
Let's go get some oceanic fish.

4141
04:05:45,970 --> 04:05:46,890
Those guys are big money.

4142
04:05:48,590 --> 04:05:52,700
Like our little whaler friend.

4143
04:05:53,200 --> 04:05:54,300
Depleted, just kidding.

4144
04:06:00,120 --> 04:06:02,260
Is this oceanic?

4145
04:06:03,820 --> 04:06:06,200
I'm too lazy to take out my...

4146
04:06:09,920 --> 04:06:13,480
Too lazy to take out my...

4147
04:06:13,480 --> 04:06:14,600
Magnifying glass.

4148
04:06:14,600 --> 04:06:18,560
But I will now.

4149
04:06:18,720 --> 04:06:19,600
Just so I know where to go.

4150
04:06:27,020 --> 04:06:28,880
I saw something else.

4151
04:06:30,060 --> 04:06:30,560
I saw it.

4152
04:06:30,940 --> 04:06:31,520
It disappeared.

4153
04:06:31,960 --> 04:06:32,680
Wherever it went.

4154
04:06:36,820 --> 04:06:38,020
Go flounder.

4155
04:06:38,560 --> 04:06:39,440
Blue mackerel.

4156
04:06:40,380 --> 04:06:40,980
What's that?

4157
04:06:41,640 --> 04:06:42,740
A blue mackerel.

4158
04:06:45,820 --> 04:06:46,420
Sailfish!

4159
04:06:47,460 --> 04:06:48,400
Sailfish, ho!

4160
04:06:52,380 --> 04:06:54,740
Sailfish are good.

4161
04:06:55,700 --> 04:06:57,000
Hope you feel better soon.

4162
04:06:57,100 --> 04:06:57,800
Thank you!

4163
04:06:58,980 --> 04:07:01,700
I've been just chilling.

4164
04:07:02,320 --> 04:07:04,520
This actually is helping so much, I'm not gonna lie.

4165
04:07:05,560 --> 04:07:07,080
I feel so relaxed.

4166
04:07:07,660 --> 04:07:08,500
Thank you guys.

4167
04:07:10,800 --> 04:07:12,460
Thank you guys.

4168
04:07:17,960 --> 04:07:18,880
Uh oh.

4169
04:07:29,140 --> 04:07:29,600
Wait.

4170
04:07:36,670 --> 04:07:37,570
We can fit this.

4171
04:07:37,670 --> 04:07:38,590
We can make this work.

4172
04:07:39,770 --> 04:07:40,910
We can make this work.

4173
04:07:44,620 --> 04:07:46,140
I might have to get rid of this guy though.

4174
04:07:49,700 --> 04:07:50,820
Are you kidding me?

4175
04:08:02,430 --> 04:08:04,110
Lower the sailfish one space.

4176
04:08:59,700 --> 04:09:01,240
It's always the sailfish.

4177
04:09:01,280 --> 04:09:02,140
It really is.

4178
04:09:03,400 --> 04:09:06,140
This guy is a thorn in my side.

4179
04:09:08,520 --> 04:09:10,340
This jeopardy theme place.

4180
04:09:10,540 --> 04:09:13,320
I'm taking this guy back if we can only take two of them.

4181
04:09:36,090 --> 04:09:39,350
If only I didn't have this one jet right here.

4182
04:09:44,570 --> 04:09:46,530
I could get rid of our spotlight.

4183
04:09:49,510 --> 04:09:51,410
Okay, bye bronze whaler.

4184
04:09:54,830 --> 04:09:55,910
That was unfortunate.

4185
04:10:02,760 --> 04:10:03,240
Wait.

4186
04:10:07,130 --> 04:10:09,310
I'm closer to Ingfeld.

4187
04:10:18,190 --> 04:10:18,830
Ugh.

4188
04:10:26,740 --> 04:10:30,960
I don't even remember.

4189
04:10:31,060 --> 04:10:32,400
I think I was just getting money, right?

4190
04:10:37,510 --> 04:10:39,010
Use more explosives here.

4191
04:10:39,110 --> 04:10:40,750
But my money...

4192
04:10:40,750 --> 04:10:42,250
They're 35 each.

4193
04:10:44,370 --> 04:10:46,150
They're 35 each.

4194
04:10:47,890 --> 04:10:49,570
Yeah, I need the...

4195
04:10:50,450 --> 04:10:51,930
See, 207 bucks.

4196
04:10:52,010 --> 04:10:52,510
It's not bad.

4197
04:10:54,070 --> 04:10:55,430
It's not bad at all.

4198
04:10:55,790 --> 04:10:57,270
This still has two days left.

4199
04:10:58,030 --> 04:10:58,750
Very nice.

4200
04:11:04,480 --> 04:11:06,320
It can save you a lot of money too.

4201
04:11:07,460 --> 04:11:07,900
I know.

4202
04:11:08,160 --> 04:11:09,040
I believe you.

4203
04:11:13,400 --> 04:11:14,820
Oh, she sells them too.

4204
04:11:16,880 --> 04:11:18,080
Good to know.

4205
04:11:20,940 --> 04:11:22,980
We can get a new light.

4206
04:11:24,160 --> 04:11:27,940
Wait, should we sell our old one and get the new light?

4207
04:11:28,340 --> 04:11:29,140
I think so.

4208
04:11:41,740 --> 04:11:44,700
Zemir, does the traveling merchant look like Spinelli from Recess?

4209
04:11:44,860 --> 04:11:46,100
I see it!

4210
04:11:46,100 --> 04:11:47,000
It's the beanie.

4211
04:11:48,520 --> 04:11:49,620
It's the beanie.

4212
04:11:57,190 --> 04:11:58,970
Oh, I almost was able to forward this.

4213
04:11:59,050 --> 04:12:00,350
Okay, let's get...

4214
04:12:03,550 --> 04:12:03,990
Let's...We...We...We...

4215
04:12:06,030 --> 04:12:06,910
We will...We...

4216
04:12:08,470 --> 04:12:12,250
We will get more big fish.

4217
04:12:14,590 --> 04:12:17,930
And buy jet, then continue.

4218
04:12:19,050 --> 04:12:20,390
Where was...

4219
04:12:24,880 --> 04:12:26,320
Where was...

4220
04:12:26,320 --> 04:12:30,810
What was that?

4221
04:12:31,370 --> 04:12:31,990
What was that?

4222
04:12:32,210 --> 04:12:33,170
Oh, tiger mackerel.

4223
04:12:35,090 --> 04:12:36,850
Oceanic perch in the coastal.

4224
04:12:37,190 --> 04:12:38,250
Don't lie to me!

4225
04:12:38,890 --> 04:12:40,050
Don't lie to me!

4226
04:12:49,560 --> 04:12:50,960
Sailfish.

4227
04:12:51,400 --> 04:12:52,340
Torto!

4228
04:13:01,160 --> 04:13:04,860
What do you guys think?

4229
04:13:07,300 --> 04:13:09,360
Alright, here we go.

4230
04:13:11,980 --> 04:13:14,060
I'm getting greedy.

4231
04:13:15,980 --> 04:13:17,620
Got him.

4232
04:13:20,220 --> 04:13:22,260
Literally can fit one at a time.

4233
04:13:23,520 --> 04:13:24,360
That's okay though.

4234
04:13:24,720 --> 04:13:25,420
Now we leave.

4235
04:13:27,780 --> 04:13:29,160
Now we leave.

4236
04:13:29,480 --> 04:13:30,720
Actually it's depleted anyway.

4237
04:13:31,280 --> 04:13:32,660
Or we can fish a little bit more.

4238
04:13:34,020 --> 04:13:36,240
Such a nice and chill stream to enjoy my birthday!

4239
04:13:36,700 --> 04:13:38,000
NCG happy birthday!

4240
04:13:41,220 --> 04:13:44,580
Happy birthday to you!

4241
04:13:45,240 --> 04:13:47,360
Happy birthday to you!

4242
04:13:47,800 --> 04:13:50,520
Happy birthday NCG goggles!

4243
04:13:52,580 --> 04:13:56,020
Happy birthday to you!

4244
04:13:57,900 --> 04:14:00,760
Happy, happy, happy birthday!

4245
04:14:07,650 --> 04:14:08,970
Nice.

4246
04:14:12,290 --> 04:14:13,050
Oops.

4247
04:14:16,110 --> 04:14:16,870
Nice.

4248
04:14:18,270 --> 04:14:20,510
Let's just get some extra fish while we are here.

4249
04:14:21,530 --> 04:14:24,350
The more money, the more honey.

4250
04:14:31,840 --> 04:14:32,600
Sorry.

4251
04:14:36,100 --> 04:14:39,480
I literally took that entire guy's family and then left him.

4252
04:14:40,160 --> 04:14:41,480
Oh boy, I'm lonesome.

4253
04:14:42,860 --> 04:14:43,960
Oh boy, I'm lonesome.

4254
04:14:45,400 --> 04:14:46,840
How much?

4255
04:14:48,840 --> 04:14:50,020
236 babies.

4256
04:14:50,460 --> 04:14:51,040
Let's go.

4257
04:14:53,900 --> 04:14:57,840
Honestly, even if I can only just do one sailfish, it's worth it.

4258
04:14:58,440 --> 04:14:59,620
It's so worth it.

4259
04:15:05,840 --> 04:15:10,280
Have a combined engine speed of 75 knots!

4260
04:15:10,280 --> 04:15:10,860
What?

4261
04:15:15,060 --> 04:15:20,220
Alright, let's get some explosives I suppose.

4262
04:15:20,700 --> 04:15:21,000
Sis.

4263
04:15:23,260 --> 04:15:25,420
Explosives I suppose, sis.

4264
04:15:38,210 --> 04:15:41,070
Can I start putting... I guess I should start putting stuff in here.

4265
04:15:41,750 --> 04:15:48,510
1, 2, 3, 1...

4266
04:15:48,510 --> 04:15:49,430
Look at that!

4267
04:15:50,170 --> 04:15:50,690
Nice!

4268
04:15:51,390 --> 04:15:52,730
We got a good amount here already.

4269
04:15:54,510 --> 04:15:55,930
Just over half.

4270
04:15:57,410 --> 04:15:57,930
Cool.

4271
04:15:59,150 --> 04:16:00,050
So many knots.

4272
04:16:03,950 --> 04:16:05,870
And just the refined metal.

4273
04:16:06,410 --> 04:16:09,050
Can you find this in the ocean or can you only buy it?

4274
04:16:10,350 --> 04:16:12,250
You see some debris nearby, you do?

4275
04:16:13,550 --> 04:16:14,250
Where are you at?

4276
04:16:16,930 --> 04:16:18,090
Holy fast!

4277
04:16:18,450 --> 04:16:20,390
Oh my gosh, you guys are speed!

4278
04:16:31,490 --> 04:16:33,430
I'll just deplete it.

4279
04:16:42,980 --> 04:16:45,180
This is the most fish here ever.

4280
04:16:45,860 --> 04:16:47,020
The biggest fish family.

4281
04:16:51,600 --> 04:16:54,360
I don't think we can move the light to a different spot.

4282
04:16:54,500 --> 04:16:55,940
That's kind of the thing.

4283
04:16:57,640 --> 04:17:01,660
Like it's kind of, you know, that's where it is.

4284
04:17:06,630 --> 04:17:07,870
You can find it but it's rare.

4285
04:17:08,010 --> 04:17:09,150
Oh, there's some hidden by explosives.

4286
04:17:12,270 --> 04:17:13,070
I see.

4287
04:17:13,330 --> 04:17:14,670
Look behind the waterfall.

4288
04:17:15,110 --> 04:17:15,550
Oh, ok.

4289
04:17:15,730 --> 04:17:16,870
I'll look behind the waterfall.

4290
04:17:17,830 --> 04:17:18,170
And...

4291
04:17:22,070 --> 04:17:26,930
Yeah, it's kind of like with these, with the light, it has to be there.

4292
04:17:27,190 --> 04:17:27,730
Unfortunately.

4293
04:17:30,350 --> 04:17:32,930
That's just how the game is.

4294
04:17:40,040 --> 04:17:40,720
Alright.

4295
04:17:41,200 --> 04:17:41,760
Undock.

4296
04:17:42,800 --> 04:17:44,160
Behind the waterfall.

4297
04:17:45,280 --> 04:17:47,500
Do I need explosives for that or...

4298
04:17:56,490 --> 04:17:57,290
Should I go?

4299
04:17:57,410 --> 04:17:58,410
Should I explode this?

4300
04:18:01,450 --> 04:18:02,950
Should I explode these parts?

4301
04:18:03,030 --> 04:18:03,770
There's two of them.

4302
04:18:08,190 --> 04:18:09,070
Why not?

4303
04:18:09,310 --> 04:18:09,550
Yeah?

4304
04:18:09,810 --> 04:18:11,130
Hold on, my chat just froze.

4305
04:18:12,050 --> 04:18:13,850
I'm sorry guys, one moment please.

4306
04:18:15,830 --> 04:18:17,150
One moment please.

4307
04:18:19,650 --> 04:18:21,170
Are you guys enjoying?

4308
04:18:21,290 --> 04:18:22,350
Did you guys have a nice weekend?

4309
04:18:23,890 --> 04:18:24,750
I hope so.

4310
04:18:26,490 --> 04:18:27,490
We are forging.

4311
04:18:30,470 --> 04:18:32,470
Looks like there's a shiny too behind the rocks.

4312
04:18:32,610 --> 04:18:36,190
I thought, it looked like to me that it was another part to...

4313
04:18:37,190 --> 04:18:38,870
To blow up, not gonna lie.

4314
04:18:40,110 --> 04:18:40,590
Let's see.

4315
04:18:42,610 --> 04:18:43,830
Oh wait, I see.

4316
04:18:44,110 --> 04:18:45,190
That looks like, maybe...

4317
04:18:47,370 --> 04:18:48,210
Use explosives.

4318
04:18:49,930 --> 04:18:52,830
It looks like that could be the special stuff that we need.

4319
04:18:53,590 --> 04:18:55,010
It looks kind of like the shape, no?

4320
04:18:56,190 --> 04:18:57,810
Oh yeah, yeah!

4321
04:18:58,930 --> 04:18:59,550
It

4322
04:19:06,490 --> 04:19:07,350
really was!

4323
04:19:10,870 --> 04:19:14,670
Slow turn.

4324
04:19:16,770 --> 04:19:18,170
No way!

4325
04:19:19,030 --> 04:19:20,030
It was worth it.

4326
04:19:23,350 --> 04:19:25,790
I need to get more explosives.

4327
04:19:25,790 --> 04:19:25,990
Explosives.

4328
04:19:29,950 --> 04:19:34,790
Yeah, the low, low price of 34 instead of...

4329
04:19:36,090 --> 04:19:37,570
However much it was.

4330
04:19:39,970 --> 04:19:42,390
How much does Zeus sell it for?

4331
04:19:43,770 --> 04:19:44,530
425!

4332
04:19:48,950 --> 04:19:50,390
Yeah, yeah.

4333
04:19:52,370 --> 04:19:55,230
I think she is literally scamming us.

4334
04:19:59,840 --> 04:20:00,360
Drift.

4335
04:20:02,260 --> 04:20:03,660
Behind the waterfall.

4336
04:20:11,630 --> 04:20:13,250
Hopefully that guy is not around here.

4337
04:20:13,590 --> 04:20:14,330
I'm scared of him.

4338
04:20:15,150 --> 04:20:16,310
Oh, he is totally around here.

4339
04:20:16,390 --> 04:20:16,950
There he is!

4340
04:20:25,140 --> 04:20:26,740
Where is the waterfall?

4341
04:20:28,500 --> 04:20:29,540
What waterfall?

4342
04:20:35,380 --> 04:20:36,420
What waterfall?

4343
04:20:40,760 --> 04:20:42,240
Listen to the drive a lot.

4344
04:20:45,040 --> 04:20:47,860
There is a lot of sounds coming from over there.

4345
04:20:51,540 --> 04:20:52,540
In the middle?

4346
04:20:53,120 --> 04:20:53,620
The center?

4347
04:21:05,760 --> 04:21:06,680
The middle.

4348
04:21:08,220 --> 04:21:09,060
Big clearing.

4349
04:21:09,300 --> 04:21:10,600
Is that where I found the...

4350
04:21:11,120 --> 04:21:13,120
Do you mean where I found the treasure before?

4351
04:21:17,740 --> 04:21:18,540
In here?

4352
04:21:21,280 --> 04:21:21,760
Please.

4353
04:21:21,960 --> 04:21:22,480
Oh my goodness.

4354
04:21:26,440 --> 04:21:28,340
Wait, this is where I just came from.

4355
04:21:29,280 --> 04:21:30,160
The whale crest.

4356
04:21:30,400 --> 04:21:32,420
I think I can find that from outside.

4357
04:21:40,980 --> 04:21:42,920
I went right underneath him!

4358
04:21:43,160 --> 04:21:44,800
Or he went right underneath me!

4359
04:21:46,880 --> 04:21:48,000
Oh god.

4360
04:21:49,260 --> 04:21:50,440
He is on my ass.

4361
04:21:51,160 --> 04:21:52,060
I can't see anything.

4362
04:21:58,380 --> 04:21:59,600
Behind the waterfall.

4363
04:22:04,790 --> 04:22:05,610
You guys!

4364
04:22:31,680 --> 04:22:35,040
The rotten chest sits atop a pile of rubble at the back of the cave.

4365
04:22:37,920 --> 04:22:40,680
I just have to get out unscathed.

4366
04:22:43,060 --> 04:22:44,540
Maybe I'll be okay.

4367
04:22:49,180 --> 04:22:50,100
What is that?

4368
04:22:51,560 --> 04:22:53,100
That looks like a...

4369
04:22:55,040 --> 04:22:56,220
I can't get him.

4370
04:22:57,220 --> 04:22:57,840
Dang it.

4371
04:22:59,620 --> 04:23:01,420
How the hell am I supposed to get out of here?

4372
04:23:03,500 --> 04:23:04,620
It's an oarfish.

4373
04:23:05,760 --> 04:23:06,700
Legendary guy.

4374
04:23:07,800 --> 04:23:09,460
I can tell from the way he looks.

4375
04:23:09,560 --> 04:23:10,220
It's an oarfish.

4376
04:23:11,420 --> 04:23:12,680
Okay, we got to get home.

4377
04:23:18,550 --> 04:23:19,350
I can't see.

4378
04:23:26,070 --> 04:23:27,830
I don't know which way I'm going.

4379
04:23:29,970 --> 04:23:31,510
But we will find our way home.

4380
04:23:31,910 --> 04:23:32,670
I don't know where I am.

4381
04:23:33,230 --> 04:23:34,310
Oh, I know where I am.

4382
04:23:34,670 --> 04:23:35,630
I know where I am!

4383
04:23:38,740 --> 04:23:39,320
This way.

4384
04:23:40,500 --> 04:23:41,260
There is wood there.

4385
04:23:42,680 --> 04:23:43,320
Keep note!

4386
04:23:52,100 --> 04:23:54,180
Lady, I need a lot of help.

4387
04:23:57,060 --> 04:23:59,100
I need a lot of help, please.

4388
04:24:05,100 --> 04:24:05,460
Lady.

4389
04:24:06,640 --> 04:24:07,620
So much to repair.

4390
04:24:07,740 --> 04:24:09,640
That's probably how much money we'll get from the balloons.

4391
04:24:09,840 --> 04:24:11,380
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

4392
04:24:11,840 --> 04:24:12,340
But you know what?

4393
04:24:12,400 --> 04:24:14,580
It's honestly worth it because this is still cheaper.

4394
04:24:15,260 --> 04:24:15,540
You know?

4395
04:24:17,600 --> 04:24:18,480
It's still cheaper.

4396
04:24:21,580 --> 04:24:22,480
Whoops, sorry, my bad.

4397
04:24:22,660 --> 04:24:23,280
Floating dock.

4398
04:24:25,100 --> 04:24:26,340
And there's two woods.

4399
04:24:26,500 --> 04:24:28,220
Honestly, we might be able to do this.

4400
04:24:32,700 --> 04:24:37,300
Well, we will be able to fill it up with the supplies, but definitely not the cost.

4401
04:24:38,460 --> 04:24:39,020
But that's okay.

4402
04:24:40,240 --> 04:24:40,880
We're broke.

4403
04:24:41,180 --> 04:24:42,140
Yeah, we're pretty broke.

4404
04:24:47,580 --> 04:24:50,800
We've been without teleport, but teleport only takes us all...

4405
04:24:50,800 --> 04:24:53,720
I don't wanna use the teleport unless like...

4406
04:24:53,720 --> 04:24:57,880
It's like serious because it's gonna take us all the way back...

4407
04:24:57,880 --> 04:24:59,300
Like over there.

4408
04:25:01,940 --> 04:25:04,680
So I don't wanna just use it like... Oh, I need to teleport!

4409
04:25:09,300 --> 04:25:09,820
But...

4410
04:25:14,390 --> 04:25:16,770
But, but, but, but...

4411
04:25:21,150 --> 04:25:21,670
But...

4412
04:25:21,670 --> 04:25:25,550
I might use it actually so that we can go sell the doubloons faster.

4413
04:25:37,110 --> 04:25:37,630
Or...

4414
04:25:38,250 --> 04:25:42,730
We sail and we get another sailfish and we sell that bad boy.

4415
04:25:43,370 --> 04:25:44,310
For some good money.

4416
04:25:48,870 --> 04:25:50,890
You guys are so obsessed with my butt.

4417
04:25:55,610 --> 04:25:57,670
We don't have space right now.

4418
04:26:01,850 --> 04:26:02,470
Watch...

4419
04:26:02,470 --> 04:26:03,290
And observe.

4420
04:26:14,490 --> 04:26:16,410
Oh wait, can I...

4421
04:26:16,410 --> 04:26:17,370
Oh wait.

4422
04:26:19,050 --> 04:26:21,690
And we should with even still the engine, right?

4423
04:26:26,100 --> 04:26:27,400
I don't know actually.

4424
04:26:29,140 --> 04:26:30,600
Actually, you might be right.

4425
04:26:32,340 --> 04:26:33,780
We'll go see.

4426
04:26:34,800 --> 04:26:35,880
I guess we'll see.

4427
04:26:40,230 --> 04:26:42,250
Only one way to find out, exactly.

4428
04:26:43,870 --> 04:26:45,750
It would be a damn shame though.

4429
04:26:46,770 --> 04:26:48,550
It would be a real shame.

4430
04:26:50,150 --> 04:26:51,450
Oh no, this isn't a sailfish.

4431
04:26:51,570 --> 04:26:51,830
Hold on.

4432
04:26:52,750 --> 04:26:53,990
Maybe we can find another one.

4433
04:26:55,430 --> 04:26:56,030
Where is home?

4434
04:26:57,530 --> 04:26:58,930
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

4435
04:27:05,190 --> 04:27:06,190
Home is this way.

4436
04:27:13,230 --> 04:27:14,270
Bronze whaler.

4437
04:27:17,290 --> 04:27:18,910
What is that thing?

4438
04:27:28,570 --> 04:27:30,230
Wait, is that one right there?

4439
04:27:31,930 --> 04:27:32,750
Is my guy broken?

4440
04:27:32,970 --> 04:27:33,050
No.

4441
04:27:35,350 --> 04:27:36,610
Oh, that's the bronze whaler.

4442
04:27:36,890 --> 04:27:37,690
We can get that guy.

4443
04:27:45,240 --> 04:27:47,100
Are you a bronze whaler?

4444
04:27:50,640 --> 04:27:53,700
I can maybe...

4445
04:27:57,600 --> 04:28:00,220
One bronze whaler?

4446
04:28:15,570 --> 04:28:16,270
You

4447
04:28:19,460 --> 04:28:22,060
were always such a problem!

4448
04:28:41,300 --> 04:28:45,840
I thought about fishing until I get a rare, but I also was like, it's starting to get a little dark.

4449
04:28:47,340 --> 04:28:48,840
A little spooky scary.

4450
04:28:56,560 --> 04:28:58,320
It sounds like it's talking.

4451
04:29:00,220 --> 04:29:01,640
It's so scary sounding.

4452
04:29:08,940 --> 04:29:11,300
Did I have any... Oh yeah, I have the doubloons.

4453
04:29:19,920 --> 04:29:21,280
Oh wait, my bad.

4454
04:29:22,000 --> 04:29:24,680
Trader, please buy my doubloons.

4455
04:29:25,580 --> 04:29:26,500
For 172?

4456
04:29:31,020 --> 04:29:36,420
Whenever I see abyssal in this, I think of the abyssals from conchole.

4457
04:29:37,040 --> 04:29:38,300
Oh, I think abysmal.

4458
04:29:38,580 --> 04:29:39,840
It's just like...

4459
04:29:39,840 --> 04:29:40,960
Kind of like...

4460
04:29:40,960 --> 04:29:43,080
Like it just sucks down there.

4461
04:29:44,600 --> 04:29:47,980
God, nobody wants to be in the abysmal.

4462
04:29:50,080 --> 04:29:55,250
Is there any guys I can get right here?

4463
04:29:56,430 --> 04:29:56,990
What are you?

4464
04:29:58,150 --> 04:29:59,290
You're a little eel.

4465
04:30:00,950 --> 04:30:01,670
Anything?

4466
04:30:02,050 --> 04:30:02,450
Let's see.

4467
04:30:02,610 --> 04:30:02,950
Anything?

4468
04:30:04,370 --> 04:30:05,890
Anything good out there?

4469
04:30:07,710 --> 04:30:09,550
Blacktip reef shark.

4470
04:30:11,230 --> 04:30:14,270
It's a little far, but it might be good.

4471
04:30:23,490 --> 04:30:24,530
Right here.

4472
04:30:25,930 --> 04:30:26,650
Sorry.

4473
04:30:34,140 --> 04:30:34,740
Oh!

4474
04:30:44,230 --> 04:30:46,430
Was that guy honking at me?

4475
04:30:53,120 --> 04:30:54,160
What's that sound?

4476
04:30:54,220 --> 04:30:56,160
I don't like it.

4477
04:30:58,720 --> 04:30:59,920
Honk honk.

4478
04:31:02,220 --> 04:31:03,420
Honk honk.

4479
04:31:04,660 --> 04:31:08,320
Let's get some, you know... Oh, I got a creepy crawly one too.

4480
04:31:09,280 --> 04:31:09,880
Perfect.

4481
04:31:10,420 --> 04:31:11,220
Let's just fill up.

4482
04:31:15,700 --> 04:31:16,160
Perfect.

4483
04:31:18,660 --> 04:31:19,360
Very good.

4484
04:31:27,870 --> 04:31:29,350
What was the music for?

4485
04:31:31,450 --> 04:31:32,550
Lousy weather lately.

4486
04:31:32,730 --> 04:31:34,410
Almost makes you not want to get out of bed.

4487
04:31:34,630 --> 04:31:35,930
You and I, we've got to do it, eh?

4488
04:31:36,410 --> 04:31:39,230
We're what keeps people from going hungry.

4489
04:31:41,170 --> 04:31:41,630
$462!

4490
04:31:44,270 --> 04:31:46,110
Guys, we're just $100 away!

4491
04:31:46,710 --> 04:31:49,230
We're just $100 away from...

4492
04:31:50,570 --> 04:31:52,810
From being able to get the upgrade.

4493
04:31:53,970 --> 04:31:55,130
Let's go!

4494
04:31:55,330 --> 04:31:56,670
And what is that upgrade?

4495
04:31:57,030 --> 04:31:59,490
It will add...

4496
04:31:59,490 --> 04:32:02,970
Upgrades your vessel to a tier 3 hull and adds 9 new cargo spaces.

4497
04:32:03,310 --> 04:32:05,150
Hull can sustain 1 additional impact.

4498
04:32:11,550 --> 04:32:12,830
Plus 15.

4499
04:32:12,830 --> 04:32:14,090
And...

4500
04:32:18,620 --> 04:32:19,260
See?

4501
04:32:20,780 --> 04:32:22,600
All we need to do...

4502
04:32:26,090 --> 04:32:28,350
Is go get...

4503
04:32:29,130 --> 04:32:29,770
A...

4504
04:32:31,710 --> 04:32:33,350
What's that guy's name?

4505
04:32:35,070 --> 04:32:36,210
A sailfish.

4506
04:32:40,420 --> 04:32:42,740
Didn't I say I was going to go to the other world?

4507
04:32:42,980 --> 04:32:44,580
Or to the other world?

4508
04:32:45,100 --> 04:32:46,660
The Stellar Basin.

4509
04:32:46,960 --> 04:32:48,100
Maybe I should go there.

4510
04:32:48,100 --> 04:32:49,360
Let's just go.

4511
04:32:52,460 --> 04:32:53,020
It's...

4512
04:32:53,020 --> 04:32:54,360
Not that way.

4513
04:32:54,440 --> 04:32:54,920
This way.

4514
04:32:55,780 --> 04:32:56,160
Yes.

4515
04:32:59,960 --> 04:33:00,700
Oh, the moon!

4516
04:33:03,000 --> 04:33:04,580
This is my first time seeing it.

4517
04:33:07,540 --> 04:33:09,820
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

4518
04:33:17,280 --> 04:33:18,180
We're human.

4519
04:33:25,990 --> 04:33:29,950
I wish my speed didn't make the time go faster.

4520
04:33:31,210 --> 04:33:31,430
You know?

4521
04:33:31,890 --> 04:33:33,330
I feel like that's kind of unfair.

4522
04:33:33,510 --> 04:33:33,630
No?

4523
04:33:33,790 --> 04:33:38,150
You're punishing me for having supersonic everything?

4524
04:33:40,210 --> 04:33:42,310
For being too good at the game?

4525
04:33:42,830 --> 04:33:43,670
You're punishing me?

4526
04:33:44,250 --> 04:33:44,750
What's this?

4527
04:33:46,230 --> 04:33:47,070
Disturbed water.

4528
04:33:47,070 --> 04:33:47,190
Disturbed.

4529
04:34:05,080 --> 04:34:07,200
Should make time go slower.

4530
04:34:07,380 --> 04:34:08,620
Right, that's what I'm saying.

4531
04:34:09,300 --> 04:34:09,840
What's this thing?

4532
04:34:16,470 --> 04:34:17,630
Shapes in the deep.

4533
04:34:24,870 --> 04:34:26,250
An anchor flag.

4534
04:34:27,210 --> 04:34:27,890
Oh, neat.

4535
04:34:29,210 --> 04:34:29,630
What?

4536
04:34:29,930 --> 04:34:31,690
Have I never noticed this before?

4537
04:34:31,910 --> 04:34:34,430
Oh my gosh, it's this actual Titanic.

4538
04:34:34,430 --> 04:34:34,550
Titanic.

4539
04:34:36,930 --> 04:34:38,390
What are you guys?

4540
04:34:43,240 --> 04:34:44,720
A barracuda.

4541
04:34:46,520 --> 04:34:47,980
Let's get some more.

4542
04:34:48,880 --> 04:34:50,160
I think these guys will sell well.

4543
04:34:54,540 --> 04:34:55,260
One more.

4544
04:34:59,220 --> 04:35:00,000
Awesome.

4545
04:35:05,880 --> 04:35:07,220
Is it inside there?

4546
04:35:08,500 --> 04:35:08,960
Yes.

4547
04:35:08,960 --> 04:35:09,020
Yes.

4548
04:35:15,600 --> 04:35:19,960
Our lady friend is over there.

4549
04:35:20,280 --> 04:35:23,740
But before we get to her, we can blow this up.

4550
04:35:27,940 --> 04:35:29,380
Use explosives.

4551
04:35:31,420 --> 04:35:31,940
Alright.

4552
04:35:36,480 --> 04:35:38,440
Oh, there's more than one.

4553
04:35:38,560 --> 04:35:39,360
Who's barking?

4554
04:35:41,180 --> 04:35:42,400
Is that in game?

4555
04:35:43,780 --> 04:35:45,180
It is in game.

4556
04:35:47,120 --> 04:35:52,080
Oh my goodness.

4557
04:36:00,380 --> 04:36:01,600
Where's the dog?

4558
04:36:05,320 --> 04:36:06,940
I don't like the creepy music.

4559
04:36:08,520 --> 04:36:09,860
I hear a dog.

4560
04:36:13,850 --> 04:36:15,390
I don't hear a dog anymore.

4561
04:36:24,750 --> 04:36:25,470
Creepy.

4562
04:36:30,640 --> 04:36:31,180
Spooky.

4563
04:36:34,020 --> 04:36:36,080
Do I have enough space for this?

4564
04:36:36,160 --> 04:36:36,780
I don't know.

4565
04:36:36,880 --> 04:36:38,040
I might be making a mistake.

4566
04:36:45,220 --> 04:36:47,820
I have like no space for this guy.

4567
04:36:49,160 --> 04:36:49,860
Hold on.

4568
04:36:50,120 --> 04:36:51,100
We can make this work.

4569
04:36:51,780 --> 04:36:53,460
As long as nobody attacks me.

4570
04:36:53,680 --> 04:36:54,880
Okay, world.

4571
04:36:56,040 --> 04:36:57,020
Okay, world.

4572
04:36:58,840 --> 04:37:00,500
We might have to sacrifice a barracuda.

4573
04:37:04,800 --> 04:37:07,920
One barracuda sacrifice is worth.

4574
04:37:08,800 --> 04:37:09,500
In my opinion.

4575
04:37:17,360 --> 04:37:18,780
That wasn't the abnormal one?

4576
04:37:19,420 --> 04:37:20,960
Oh, it wasn't?

4577
04:37:22,440 --> 04:37:23,260
It's fine.

4578
04:37:23,820 --> 04:37:24,460
It's okay.

4579
04:37:25,060 --> 04:37:25,600
I panicked.

4580
04:37:25,700 --> 04:37:27,160
I thought something was coming towards me.

4581
04:37:29,480 --> 04:37:30,380
Oh, you're right.

4582
04:37:30,440 --> 04:37:31,360
It's just a glowing octopus.

4583
04:37:33,360 --> 04:37:33,920
Oopsie.

4584
04:37:33,920 --> 04:37:35,360
Oh well.

4585
04:37:40,400 --> 04:37:41,620
All good.

4586
04:37:45,500 --> 04:37:48,940
And with that, my friends.

4587
04:38:01,410 --> 04:38:07,430
Net space, rod space, cargo space, engine space, light space.

4588
04:38:10,790 --> 04:38:12,710
I'm starting to get hungry though.

4589
04:38:14,230 --> 04:38:15,150
Oh, oops.

4590
04:38:19,120 --> 04:38:20,300
No, that's not what I wanted to do.

4591
04:38:20,500 --> 04:38:20,940
Shipyard!

4592
04:38:31,510 --> 04:38:33,370
Look at all that room!

4593
04:38:36,910 --> 04:38:37,350
Nice.

4594
04:38:44,390 --> 04:38:47,350
What sucks though is that I haven't really gotten any more research bars.

4595
04:38:47,970 --> 04:38:55,070
So, I'm kind of like, not able to kind of improve my stuff.

4596
04:39:02,660 --> 04:39:05,500
Why did I move my rod over there?

4597
04:39:06,740 --> 04:39:07,600
Slaps boat.

4598
04:39:07,720 --> 04:39:09,760
This baby can fit so many sailfish in.

4599
04:39:14,270 --> 04:39:16,190
I have to start buying them regularly.

4600
04:39:16,530 --> 04:39:17,110
Oh, maybe.

4601
04:39:20,710 --> 04:39:22,470
There are a limited amount of those per area.

4602
04:39:22,470 --> 04:39:25,590
I think, honestly, at this rate...

4603
04:39:25,590 --> 04:39:29,620
If we get a couple sailfish on board, we can buy, you know...

4604
04:39:30,130 --> 04:39:32,250
We can buy one, so it's not so bad.

4605
04:39:33,770 --> 04:39:37,890
Oh, I gotta get the explosive so we can... The trees are going crazy.

4606
04:39:39,370 --> 04:39:43,010
Let me get the explosive so we can...

4607
04:39:43,010 --> 04:39:47,290
Go clear out the other... There was like another side of that area.

4608
04:39:49,550 --> 04:39:51,410
Seemed like just a shortcut, but...

4609
04:39:55,870 --> 04:39:56,490
Oh, repair!

4610
04:39:56,870 --> 04:39:57,510
Sorry, I forgot.

4611
04:39:59,430 --> 04:40:01,230
It's okay though, because...

4612
04:40:06,270 --> 04:40:07,370
Where's the dog?

4613
04:40:13,920 --> 04:40:15,420
Oh yeah, this is just like a shortcut.

4614
04:40:21,680 --> 04:40:23,440
Might save my butt sometime though.

4615
04:40:31,880 --> 04:40:33,520
Sounds like he's to your left.

4616
04:40:35,460 --> 04:40:35,980
Oh!

4617
04:40:36,620 --> 04:40:38,060
I have my headphones on wrong!

4618
04:40:41,580 --> 04:40:43,940
I was like, no, I'm pretty sure he's on my right.

4619
04:40:51,520 --> 04:40:52,700
There he is!

4620
04:41:00,950 --> 04:41:04,530
There is a skinny brown dog leaping around the shallows.

4621
04:41:04,590 --> 04:41:08,030
Occasionally it lunges at the water, snapping at some small silvery fish.

4622
04:41:08,030 --> 04:41:09,510
Its technique is ineffective.

4623
04:41:11,610 --> 04:41:13,950
You jump off the boat into high water.

4624
04:41:14,570 --> 04:41:16,650
The dog stops chasing fish and focuses on you.

4625
04:41:17,810 --> 04:41:18,870
Throw some fish towards the dog.

4626
04:41:19,270 --> 04:41:21,130
You throw some scraps into the water near the dog.

4627
04:41:21,270 --> 04:41:23,270
It pounces at the splash and swallows seawater.

4628
04:41:24,610 --> 04:41:25,290
Pet the dog!

4629
04:41:25,630 --> 04:41:27,130
You're too far away to pet the dog.

4630
04:41:28,150 --> 04:41:28,950
Approach slowly.

4631
04:41:29,510 --> 04:41:30,610
You wade towards the shore.

4632
04:41:30,750 --> 04:41:32,410
As you get nearer, the dog backs a little away.

4633
04:41:32,450 --> 04:41:32,890
It sits.

4634
04:41:34,230 --> 04:41:34,630
Slowly.

4635
04:41:35,690 --> 04:41:39,390
You start to walk closer to the dog, but it runs away nervously and hides in some bushes.

4636
04:41:40,050 --> 04:41:41,810
After a few moments, it emerges again.

4637
04:41:42,650 --> 04:41:43,390
Throw some fish.

4638
04:41:45,150 --> 04:41:46,750
You throw some fish.

4639
04:41:46,970 --> 04:41:47,730
Fish land in the sand.

4640
04:41:47,790 --> 04:41:48,430
The dog eats them.

4641
04:41:48,790 --> 04:41:50,210
Along with a mouthful of sand.

4642
04:41:51,750 --> 04:41:52,750
Call for the dog.

4643
04:41:52,810 --> 04:41:54,270
You make soft, encouraging noises.

4644
04:41:55,570 --> 04:41:57,330
And the dog cautiously approaches.

4645
04:41:58,070 --> 04:41:59,610
Hold some fish in my hand.

4646
04:42:00,570 --> 04:42:02,910
The dog approaches and begins licking at them.

4647
04:42:03,410 --> 04:42:04,290
Pet the dog!

4648
04:42:07,330 --> 04:42:09,130
You reach out and gently pet the dog.

4649
04:42:09,710 --> 04:42:12,990
It's eyes follow your hand and seems to understand that you're not a threat.

4650
04:42:15,150 --> 04:42:16,690
It seems to be enjoying it.

4651
04:42:23,100 --> 04:42:24,380
What do you mean leave?

4652
04:42:25,260 --> 04:42:28,340
As you're wading... Oh, you hear slashing of four legs cutting through the water.

4653
04:42:29,120 --> 04:42:29,880
The dog!

4654
04:42:30,380 --> 04:42:31,180
Let it follow you!

4655
04:42:34,300 --> 04:42:34,820
Oh!

4656
04:42:35,440 --> 04:42:36,840
We got a dog!

4657
04:42:38,580 --> 04:42:40,100
Pursuit... wait, pursuit updated.

4658
04:42:40,880 --> 04:42:42,180
You lift the dog onto the deck.

4659
04:42:42,560 --> 04:42:45,640
It walks around briefly before curling into a ball looking up at you.

4660
04:42:45,960 --> 04:42:48,000
Maybe you can find this dog a more permanent home.

4661
04:42:51,420 --> 04:42:53,460
Who wants this dog?

4662
04:42:54,320 --> 04:42:55,820
Find the dog a home.

4663
04:42:58,740 --> 04:43:00,120
It's bound to be hungry.

4664
04:43:01,180 --> 04:43:01,580
What?

4665
04:43:04,560 --> 04:43:05,860
We saved him.

4666
04:43:08,800 --> 04:43:10,720
Look how cute this guy is though.

4667
04:43:10,900 --> 04:43:11,960
He looks so sleepy.

4668
04:43:13,200 --> 04:43:14,940
He looks so sleepy.

4669
04:43:16,500 --> 04:43:17,940
Guys, what should I have for dinner tonight?

4670
04:43:26,610 --> 04:43:27,170
Fish.

4671
04:43:28,010 --> 04:43:30,090
Look at that thing on the left.

4672
04:43:30,270 --> 04:43:31,070
It's crazy looking.

4673
04:43:32,610 --> 04:43:34,070
I want the hammerhead shark.

4674
04:43:34,970 --> 04:43:35,750
I don't know.

4675
04:43:37,150 --> 04:43:39,370
We probably can...we're around this area.

4676
04:43:39,490 --> 04:43:40,490
We can find him maybe.

4677
04:44:01,770 --> 04:44:02,250
Wait.

4678
04:44:03,210 --> 04:44:04,170
Oh dammit.

4679
04:44:04,410 --> 04:44:06,410
Wait, I don't think we can catch him now though.

4680
04:44:07,410 --> 04:44:10,090
Because...I don't think we can catch him now then because he...

4681
04:44:10,090 --> 04:44:11,950
He's gonna be too big, isn't he?

4682
04:44:21,660 --> 04:44:22,800
I caught him.

4683
04:44:23,720 --> 04:44:24,840
He's not too big.

4684
04:44:25,360 --> 04:44:26,340
Not for my boat.

4685
04:44:28,900 --> 04:44:32,580
The dog is in more danger than ever.

4686
04:44:33,040 --> 04:44:34,800
No, he was the one driving.

4687
04:44:36,380 --> 04:44:38,220
He took hold of my...

4688
04:44:38,520 --> 04:44:41,300
He took hold of my...

4689
04:44:41,300 --> 04:44:43,520
My ship.

4690
04:44:47,670 --> 04:44:50,990
I wish that even turning didn't affect the time.

4691
04:45:20,020 --> 04:45:21,640
He scared me!

4692
04:45:23,280 --> 04:45:24,040
I got good.

4693
04:45:29,130 --> 04:45:30,750
I'm starting to get pretty hungry.

4694
04:45:30,850 --> 04:45:31,470
I might need a snack.

4695
04:45:33,130 --> 04:45:34,350
Luckily, I have some popcorn.

4696
04:45:35,130 --> 04:45:35,950
A little snack break.

4697
04:45:36,950 --> 04:45:38,270
Can we bring him on board too?

4698
04:45:38,350 --> 04:45:38,930
I wish.

4699
04:45:50,700 --> 04:45:51,180
216!

4700
04:45:55,930 --> 04:45:57,450
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

4701
04:46:03,350 --> 04:46:05,050
I'm sorry dog, you go to storage.

4702
04:46:15,940 --> 04:46:17,100
Now we...prepare.

4703
04:46:19,400 --> 04:46:20,560
84 bucks.

4704
04:46:21,340 --> 04:46:21,920
Expensive.

4705
04:46:26,900 --> 04:46:30,620
Sorry, when I get so hungry, my blood sugar gets like crazy.

4706
04:46:34,210 --> 04:46:35,330
If I had blood.

4707
04:46:35,590 --> 04:46:36,950
That's how I describe it to you guys.

4708
04:46:47,870 --> 04:46:48,690
Ecto-sugar.

4709
04:47:00,700 --> 04:47:01,580
Take your time.

4710
04:47:01,700 --> 04:47:02,120
Thank you!

4711
04:47:02,460 --> 04:47:04,940
Just need a couple mouthfuls.

4712
04:47:13,050 --> 04:47:14,710
I have to figure out what I want for dinner though.

4713
04:47:16,110 --> 04:47:17,010
I don't know yet.

4714
04:47:30,700 --> 04:47:31,420
Our map.

4715
04:47:32,600 --> 04:47:35,460
So the guy...the next thing that we need is definitely in the middle.

4716
04:47:35,600 --> 04:47:36,720
But how do I get it?

4717
04:47:37,060 --> 04:47:38,960
I still need to talk to the research outpost.

4718
04:47:44,610 --> 04:47:45,210
Sushi.

4719
04:47:45,710 --> 04:47:47,730
I had sushi the other day.

4720
04:47:55,330 --> 04:47:57,410
What if I had it again?

4721
04:47:58,750 --> 04:48:00,190
It's just expensive, you know.

4722
04:48:03,210 --> 04:48:04,570
A little pricey.

4723
04:48:04,770 --> 04:48:05,470
Look at that thing.

4724
04:48:07,350 --> 04:48:08,330
Don't touch me.

4725
04:48:11,610 --> 04:48:13,330
Is this the research outpost?

4726
04:48:14,010 --> 04:48:14,510
Right here?

4727
04:48:19,530 --> 04:48:20,350
Eel sushi.

4728
04:48:20,610 --> 04:48:21,050
Yummy!

4729
04:48:21,530 --> 04:48:22,230
It's my favorite.

4730
04:48:26,610 --> 04:48:27,970
Oh, I didn't put my net out.

4731
04:48:28,110 --> 04:48:28,570
My bad.

4732
04:48:28,750 --> 04:48:29,150
I'll put it out.

4733
04:48:29,650 --> 04:48:33,390
The laboratory is in ruins with equipment and research papers strewn about the place.

4734
04:48:34,750 --> 04:48:35,750
Where do you want to look?

4735
04:48:36,150 --> 04:48:36,870
The cupboards?

4736
04:48:38,730 --> 04:48:39,170
Nice!

4737
04:48:44,610 --> 04:48:46,730
Prototype parts, but you can't use them right now.

4738
04:48:49,690 --> 04:48:52,170
On the other side of the table you find a hastily scrawled note.

4739
04:48:52,250 --> 04:48:52,950
It reads, Not safe.

4740
04:48:53,450 --> 04:48:55,110
Expect retaliation imminently.

4741
04:48:55,470 --> 04:48:56,470
Evacuating to fort.

4742
04:49:02,190 --> 04:49:08,750
There are cracks in the base of the structure that grow to large gashes as you follow them along to the walls.

4743
04:49:11,510 --> 04:49:14,130
Something extremely large and powerful created these holes.

4744
04:49:14,730 --> 04:49:16,170
You slowly reach your arm into one.

4745
04:49:22,840 --> 04:49:23,720
Research part.

4746
04:49:27,050 --> 04:49:28,950
I don't really have a favorite food.

4747
04:49:29,970 --> 04:49:30,770
Maybe tacos.

4748
04:49:35,540 --> 04:49:37,380
I haven't had Taco Bell in a minute.

4749
04:49:39,000 --> 04:49:40,700
Old generator sputters and ticks over.

4750
04:49:45,390 --> 04:49:47,230
We have two research parts guys.

4751
04:49:47,310 --> 04:49:47,870
What do we do?

4752
04:49:50,630 --> 04:49:52,570
I could do the large net.

4753
04:49:53,370 --> 04:49:54,790
That might be pretty nice.

4754
04:49:54,930 --> 04:49:56,050
That might be pretty nice.

4755
04:50:03,580 --> 04:50:04,460
New rod.

4756
04:50:06,720 --> 04:50:08,320
I do want an abyssal rod.

4757
04:50:08,580 --> 04:50:09,360
How do I get to it?

4758
04:50:13,480 --> 04:50:15,080
Where is the mangrove?

4759
04:50:23,380 --> 04:50:25,720
The rod in the middle catches almost everything.

4760
04:50:37,630 --> 04:50:40,470
You're close to unlocking the abyssal rod in this area.

4761
04:50:41,150 --> 04:50:42,170
They'll give me one.

4762
04:50:42,630 --> 04:50:44,970
I feel like I should finish the net.

4763
04:50:45,190 --> 04:50:45,930
It's like free money.

4764
04:50:50,490 --> 04:50:51,810
I still have one left.

4765
04:50:54,750 --> 04:50:56,910
Actually, I'm going to use it just in case.

4766
04:50:57,110 --> 04:50:57,470
I don't know.

4767
04:50:57,590 --> 04:50:59,410
I don't expect something to happen, but you never know.

4768
04:50:59,770 --> 04:51:00,790
You never know.

4769
04:51:01,930 --> 04:51:03,470
Let's go for...

4770
04:51:23,400 --> 04:51:24,840
We don't have storage here.

4771
04:51:26,980 --> 04:51:28,060
There's no storage.

4772
04:51:32,430 --> 04:51:33,430
Try the pots.

4773
04:51:34,670 --> 04:51:38,270
I need to use the crab pots, don't I?

4774
04:51:39,490 --> 04:51:42,470
I really need to get the crab pots, don't I?

4775
04:52:07,490 --> 04:52:08,990
Catch research parts?

4776
04:52:09,030 --> 04:52:09,330
Really?

4777
04:52:10,430 --> 04:52:10,970
An investment.

4778
04:52:14,470 --> 04:52:16,650
Maybe then I should get the large pot.

4779
04:52:24,430 --> 04:52:25,870
Fish tacos for dinner.

4780
04:52:27,370 --> 04:52:29,170
I don't know where to get fish tacos.

4781
04:52:33,840 --> 04:52:35,360
I don't know where to get some.

4782
04:52:36,140 --> 04:52:38,320
We researched two things!

4783
04:52:40,380 --> 04:52:43,240
There was nothing here.

4784
04:52:43,900 --> 04:52:45,780
Nothing that I expected to be here.

4785
04:52:46,620 --> 04:52:48,280
There's also this little area.

4786
04:52:52,670 --> 04:52:56,110
A little island to the west.

4787
04:53:02,710 --> 04:53:03,710
Nothing here.

4788
04:53:09,290 --> 04:53:11,090
That's not as little as I thought it would be.

4789
04:53:11,590 --> 04:53:12,570
It's like a castle.

4790
04:53:13,810 --> 04:53:15,590
Wait, they did say go back to the fort.

4791
04:53:15,850 --> 04:53:16,930
Is this the fort?

4792
04:53:20,970 --> 04:53:21,370
Oh,

4793
04:53:31,020 --> 04:53:31,300
my net.

4794
04:53:31,440 --> 04:53:31,700
Thank you.

4795
04:53:38,800 --> 04:53:39,460
There it is.

4796
04:53:49,170 --> 04:53:49,570
Researcher.

4797
04:53:58,070 --> 04:53:59,790
A fisherman all the way out here?

4798
04:54:00,230 --> 04:54:00,590
Strange.

4799
04:54:01,450 --> 04:54:02,950
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you all the same.

4800
04:54:05,050 --> 04:54:06,390
I've not seen another soul in months.

4801
04:54:07,050 --> 04:54:10,750
In fact, I could do with your help if you had the time.

4802
04:54:11,170 --> 04:54:12,010
Yeah, what is it?

4803
04:54:13,050 --> 04:54:15,450
I need help collecting samples to study.

4804
04:54:16,430 --> 04:54:19,910
It was originally posted at the research outpost in the interior of the basin, but it was attacked.

4805
04:54:21,090 --> 04:54:23,850
A large creature emerged from the depths and destroyed the outpost.

4806
04:54:24,030 --> 04:54:25,730
Now it rests in the center of the basin.

4807
04:54:25,730 --> 04:54:30,770
I fled here and have been making due as best I can.

4808
04:54:31,110 --> 04:54:32,970
I had to leave most of my equipment behind.

4809
04:54:33,230 --> 04:54:34,990
Oh yeah, I looted that place.

4810
04:54:36,990 --> 04:54:38,230
What a burger.

4811
04:54:38,930 --> 04:54:40,290
I had a burger yesterday.

4812
04:54:43,730 --> 04:54:45,830
I had a burger yesterday.

4813
04:54:52,850 --> 04:54:54,890
Now my research has come to a halt.

4814
04:54:54,890 --> 04:55:00,410
Take a look at this list of specimens.

4815
04:55:00,830 --> 04:55:02,050
Oh, I got that guy.

4816
04:55:04,590 --> 04:55:05,470
Aurora jellyfish.

4817
04:55:05,510 --> 04:55:06,690
I guess I've caught that too.

4818
04:55:07,430 --> 04:55:08,110
I don't know when.

4819
04:55:08,690 --> 04:55:09,610
Please drop them off here.

4820
04:55:09,890 --> 04:55:13,410
You might need to experiment with different fishing strategies to collect all of them.

4821
04:55:14,090 --> 04:55:14,350
Okay.

4822
04:55:16,610 --> 04:55:17,790
Tell me about yourself.

4823
04:55:18,390 --> 04:55:19,810
I don't think there's much to say.

4824
04:55:20,110 --> 04:55:22,730
I studied biological sciences at Iron Haven College.

4825
04:55:23,010 --> 04:55:23,550
It was a struggle.

4826
04:55:23,550 --> 04:55:26,630
There were no other female students in the department that year.

4827
04:55:26,770 --> 04:55:27,450
Or the year before.

4828
04:55:27,790 --> 04:55:28,670
Or the year before that.

4829
04:55:29,570 --> 04:55:32,630
It's hard not to feel like an outsider in an environment like that, you know?

4830
04:55:32,990 --> 04:55:33,710
You probably don't.

4831
04:55:34,010 --> 04:55:35,170
Okay, gosh.

4832
04:55:38,050 --> 04:55:42,650
When I graduated, I managed to land a job at the Northern Biological Research Society.

4833
04:55:44,770 --> 04:55:46,950
And then, well, I was posted here by myself.

4834
04:55:46,990 --> 04:55:48,410
What are you researching?

4835
04:55:50,190 --> 04:55:53,110
I thought I would relish the peace and quiet.

4836
04:55:53,630 --> 04:55:54,630
But I miss having company.

4837
04:55:55,090 --> 04:55:56,490
Do you want a dog?

4838
04:55:57,650 --> 04:55:59,230
I've always had someone, or at least a pet.

4839
04:55:59,550 --> 04:56:01,190
Out here, it's just machines.

4840
04:56:01,610 --> 04:56:02,350
Is there anything else?

4841
04:56:04,530 --> 04:56:05,730
We have a dog.

4842
04:56:06,950 --> 04:56:08,130
That was the fastest quest ever.

4843
04:56:08,450 --> 04:56:09,550
What sort of creature attacked you?

4844
04:56:10,610 --> 04:56:14,390
I got the sense that it was attacking the research outpost itself rather than me specifically.

4845
04:56:14,390 --> 04:56:18,430
I suspect it was disturbed by some of my monitoring equipment.

4846
04:56:18,590 --> 04:56:22,010
There were dozens of machines running there, all powered by a noisy generator.

4847
04:56:22,730 --> 04:56:25,810
It was huge, larger than any other marine species I've ever studied.

4848
04:56:26,670 --> 04:56:31,190
It attacked with tentacles, so I guess some sort of octopus or squid.

4849
04:56:31,390 --> 04:56:32,090
Or an anemone.

4850
04:56:34,350 --> 04:56:38,190
One of my research vessels was moored around the back of the station.

4851
04:56:38,570 --> 04:56:42,670
So I managed to slip away in that while it was tearing apart the front.

4852
04:56:42,670 --> 04:56:46,570
There was a lot of valuable data and equipment left there.

4853
04:56:46,810 --> 04:56:47,550
But I'm not going back.

4854
04:56:47,570 --> 04:56:48,010
I can't.

4855
04:56:48,110 --> 04:56:49,170
I won't face it again.

4856
04:56:51,210 --> 04:56:53,910
Have you noticed anything else unusual since you arrived?

4857
04:56:54,650 --> 04:56:58,990
Now that you mention it, I've been so preoccupied with the attack and having to rebuild here, I'd almost forgotten.

4858
04:56:59,610 --> 04:57:01,030
I found these letters from my sister.

4859
04:57:01,650 --> 04:57:03,670
She sent them to me while I was studying before...

4860
04:57:05,110 --> 04:57:05,910
Before she...

4861
04:57:05,910 --> 04:57:08,930
The researcher went quiet for a moment and stares off to the side.

4862
04:57:09,270 --> 04:57:11,490
Oh no, her sister...

4863
04:57:11,490 --> 04:57:14,730
Anyway, I kept finding them amongst my papers.

4864
04:57:14,890 --> 04:57:16,910
I don't remember packing them, but I must have.

4865
04:57:17,930 --> 04:57:19,630
I started finding them more frequently.

4866
04:57:20,230 --> 04:57:21,870
They turned up in my collection nets.

4867
04:57:22,050 --> 04:57:23,110
In my sampling tubes.

4868
04:57:23,530 --> 04:57:23,750
What?

4869
04:57:24,410 --> 04:57:26,190
They were letters I'd never seen before.

4870
04:57:26,450 --> 04:57:27,390
But they were her writing.

4871
04:57:27,850 --> 04:57:28,810
They were in her name.

4872
04:57:28,890 --> 04:57:29,990
That's weird.

4873
04:57:31,910 --> 04:57:34,870
They were saying things, talking about things that happened after she died.

4874
04:57:34,890 --> 04:57:35,890
I can't explain it.

4875
04:57:39,010 --> 04:57:39,970
That's weird.

4876
04:57:50,320 --> 04:57:50,640
Oh...

4877
04:57:52,120 --> 04:57:53,660
This dog needs a home, do you want it?

4878
04:57:54,200 --> 04:57:54,600
A dog?

4879
04:57:54,760 --> 04:57:55,920
Oh gosh, let me see.

4880
04:57:57,400 --> 04:57:58,900
The dog bounds over to the researcher.

4881
04:57:59,100 --> 04:58:00,860
She crouches down to pet the dog, grinning.

4882
04:58:00,980 --> 04:58:02,440
The dog licks her chin in response.

4883
04:58:03,300 --> 04:58:04,860
I could definitely take this one off your hands.

4884
04:58:05,120 --> 04:58:06,040
And I'd love the company.

4885
04:58:06,320 --> 04:58:06,820
Are you sure?

4886
04:58:07,200 --> 04:58:08,680
Nah, I don't want the dog.

4887
04:58:09,980 --> 04:58:10,940
Yeah, I take the dog.

4888
04:58:13,020 --> 04:58:14,020
He needs some medicine.

4889
04:58:14,100 --> 04:58:15,240
He needs a vet, for real.

4890
04:58:16,060 --> 04:58:17,540
We're going to be such good friends.

4891
04:58:17,540 --> 04:58:18,760
He can be my assistant.

4892
04:58:19,620 --> 04:58:21,540
Suddenly the dog stands...

4893
04:58:23,640 --> 04:58:25,860
upright and begins to retch.

4894
04:58:27,000 --> 04:58:27,940
Its stomach heaving.

4895
04:58:28,120 --> 04:58:29,480
I told you he needed a vet!

4896
04:58:30,520 --> 04:58:33,080
Seconds later, it vomits a wet glob onto the floor.

4897
04:58:33,600 --> 04:58:35,160
Something glistens through the mucus.

4898
04:58:36,360 --> 04:58:37,180
That's interesting.

4899
04:58:37,420 --> 04:58:38,480
I suppose that's yours.

4900
04:58:43,440 --> 04:58:44,000
Thanks.

4901
04:58:44,000 --> 04:58:46,740
I can clean the rest up.

4902
04:58:46,780 --> 04:58:47,740
Don't worry about it.

4903
04:58:47,780 --> 04:58:49,000
Yeah, it's your dog.

4904
04:59:01,930 --> 04:59:03,250
Let's see real quick.

4905
04:59:04,230 --> 04:59:06,050
Because I know...

4906
04:59:08,570 --> 04:59:09,870
Collect all the samples.

4907
04:59:10,530 --> 04:59:12,050
Glowing octopus, firefly squid.

4908
04:59:12,130 --> 04:59:14,790
Are these all... These all seem like night time critters.

4909
04:59:21,600 --> 04:59:22,660
Firefly squid.

4910
04:59:22,980 --> 04:59:24,300
Yep, they're all night time.

4911
04:59:24,900 --> 04:59:27,760
Time to undock.

4912
04:59:30,800 --> 04:59:32,720
And look around.

4913
04:59:39,380 --> 04:59:40,620
What are you?

4914
04:59:40,940 --> 04:59:41,840
Can't touch you.

4915
04:59:42,900 --> 04:59:43,720
Glowing octopus.

4916
04:59:44,900 --> 04:59:45,820
Let's just go inside.

4917
04:59:51,160 --> 04:59:53,500
Does she care if they're rotting?

4918
04:59:53,500 --> 04:59:55,500
She's not going to eat them, so like...

4919
04:59:56,780 --> 05:00:00,560
It's probably fine if they're a little gross, no?

4920
05:00:09,800 --> 05:00:10,800
It's fine?

4921
05:00:11,260 --> 05:00:11,880
Ok, cool.

4922
05:00:14,680 --> 05:00:16,340
I like this area.

4923
05:00:16,440 --> 05:00:16,840
It's pretty.

4924
05:00:21,800 --> 05:00:24,360
I didn't need to do anything.

4925
05:00:24,820 --> 05:00:25,260
Let's go.

4926
05:00:31,130 --> 05:00:32,070
Let's see.

4927
05:00:35,280 --> 05:00:37,470
I like that we can see the lighthouse from here.

4928
05:00:42,260 --> 05:00:43,710
Good job, net.

4929
05:00:46,670 --> 05:00:48,870
Minto wins by doing nothing.

4930
05:00:53,350 --> 05:00:54,910
That's the research.

4931
05:00:58,280 --> 05:00:59,290
Oh, we got more.

4932
05:01:08,740 --> 05:01:10,620
Where is everything?

4933
05:01:11,880 --> 05:01:13,220
Actually... Oh wait, here we go.

4934
05:01:17,230 --> 05:01:18,610
It's hard to see.

4935
05:01:20,050 --> 05:01:21,630
For some of these guys, you know?

4936
05:01:22,570 --> 05:01:25,970
Maybe we'll get the creepy one that I was promised before.

4937
05:01:28,930 --> 05:01:31,070
I promised creepy guy.

4938
05:01:32,470 --> 05:01:33,890
I'm just going to keep collecting them.

4939
05:01:41,590 --> 05:01:42,390
Ah!

4940
05:01:44,710 --> 05:01:46,210
Medusa octopus.

4941
05:01:47,130 --> 05:01:52,410
Eight snapping mouths crawl over each other at the behest of a silent master.

4942
05:01:53,550 --> 05:01:53,990
Nice.

4943
05:01:54,670 --> 05:01:56,170
Creepy guy, creepy guy.

4944
05:02:06,220 --> 05:02:10,500
In the end, it all worked out.

4945
05:02:14,360 --> 05:02:15,000
You?

4946
05:02:15,700 --> 05:02:18,300
Oh my gosh, we would get so much money for all of these.

4947
05:02:19,660 --> 05:02:21,980
I must sell all but one.

4948
05:02:26,680 --> 05:02:28,120
Do not hold F.

4949
05:02:28,200 --> 05:02:29,640
I'm not, I'm not.

4950
05:02:30,460 --> 05:02:31,960
Large crab pot.

4951
05:02:36,280 --> 05:02:38,260
What is it that I bought?

4952
05:02:39,540 --> 05:02:40,540
The net.

4953
05:02:44,420 --> 05:02:44,940
Uninstall.

4954
05:02:46,880 --> 05:02:47,400
Reinstall.

4955
05:02:48,380 --> 05:02:49,140
Take you.

4956
05:02:53,990 --> 05:02:56,070
Should I repair it first?

4957
05:02:56,170 --> 05:02:58,670
Yeah, we'll repair it so we get full money amount.

4958
05:02:58,870 --> 05:02:59,530
Because it's only $20.

4959
05:03:00,150 --> 05:03:01,910
And then we'll buy the new one.

4960
05:03:03,990 --> 05:03:05,750
It's coastal and shallow.

4961
05:03:05,890 --> 05:03:06,250
Okay, good.

4962
05:03:06,750 --> 05:03:07,370
So, repair.

4963
05:03:09,910 --> 05:03:11,590
Oh, it's still the same.

4964
05:03:11,590 --> 05:03:12,870
That's disappointing.

4965
05:03:16,750 --> 05:03:17,550
Sell.

4966
05:03:17,550 --> 05:03:18,350
Buy.

4967
05:03:28,340 --> 05:03:29,280
I didn't realize.

4968
05:03:43,150 --> 05:03:44,590
We can...

4969
05:03:45,230 --> 05:03:46,550
We can do this.

4970
05:03:46,870 --> 05:03:52,230
I just need to get some cloth and some wood and we'll be...

4971
05:03:55,370 --> 05:03:56,170
Sorry.

4972
05:03:56,730 --> 05:03:58,490
We will have more space.

4973
05:04:08,080 --> 05:04:09,260
We're okay.

4974
05:04:11,020 --> 05:04:12,640
I didn't mess up.

4975
05:04:13,320 --> 05:04:15,060
It's all according to the plan.

4976
05:04:22,660 --> 05:04:24,100
Early investment.

4977
05:04:24,240 --> 05:04:24,620
Exactly.

4978
05:04:27,380 --> 05:04:33,160
There is 100% wood and cloth here.

4979
05:04:34,920 --> 05:04:36,600
Speak of the devil.

4980
05:04:42,540 --> 05:04:43,020
Lumber.

4981
05:04:45,620 --> 05:04:47,160
I'll even get a second one.

4982
05:04:48,460 --> 05:04:50,080
Maybe a third if it allows.

4983
05:04:57,010 --> 05:04:57,830
Oops, sorry.

4984
05:04:58,030 --> 05:04:59,010
I saw the wrong thing.

4985
05:05:02,070 --> 05:05:02,550
Yeah!

4986
05:05:03,730 --> 05:05:04,770
Trust the plan.

4987
05:05:04,870 --> 05:05:05,930
Exactly, exactly.

4988
05:05:06,590 --> 05:05:09,410
What is this?

4989
05:05:13,570 --> 05:05:14,750
Big money.

4990
05:05:15,010 --> 05:05:16,170
That's what that is.

4991
05:05:17,010 --> 05:05:17,490
There

4992
05:05:23,280 --> 05:05:25,600
we go.

4993
05:05:29,280 --> 05:05:31,560
Believe in the Minky that believes in you.

4994
05:05:31,860 --> 05:05:32,300
Exactly.

4995
05:05:38,740 --> 05:05:39,580
Okay.

4996
05:05:39,580 --> 05:05:40,420
Researcher.

4997
05:05:41,060 --> 05:05:41,880
Your specimen.

4998
05:05:48,750 --> 05:05:50,810
Where did the Aurora Jellyfish go?

4999
05:06:15,140 --> 05:06:18,240
The music is reminding me of that Naruto song.

5000
05:06:23,940 --> 05:06:27,620
Well it's fine because I didn't even get the Firefly Squid.

5001
05:06:28,660 --> 05:06:30,020
And we needed that guy.

5002
05:06:44,400 --> 05:06:46,260
Naruto's sad music.

5003
05:06:50,940 --> 05:06:52,300
Well shoot.

5004
05:06:54,430 --> 05:06:58,560
In the meantime, I'm gonna sell this shark and then I'm gonna find some...

5005
05:06:59,080 --> 05:07:08,660
I'm gonna find some cloth!

5006
05:07:09,500 --> 05:07:12,260
And then everything will not be important.

5007
05:07:12,860 --> 05:07:12,880
Not!

5008
05:07:25,580 --> 05:07:28,420
Don't laugh at my teeth or something.

5009
05:07:30,480 --> 05:07:31,240
Okay.

5010
05:07:32,900 --> 05:07:34,220
Oh, wrong thing.

5011
05:07:52,880 --> 05:07:56,000
Any second now we'll see cloth.

5012
05:07:56,340 --> 05:07:57,000
Immediately.

5013
05:07:58,040 --> 05:08:00,340
Any second now cloth will be on the menu.

5014
05:08:02,280 --> 05:08:03,420
Any second.

5015
05:08:08,120 --> 05:08:10,380
Any second now there will be cloth.

5016
05:08:18,120 --> 05:08:20,500
It's probably right behind here.

5017
05:08:23,220 --> 05:08:25,200
This is the Angry Crab.

5018
05:08:39,940 --> 05:08:42,240
Sounds like even the monkeys are laughing at me.

5019
05:08:43,160 --> 05:08:43,920
What is that?

5020
05:08:44,440 --> 05:08:45,940
The kookaburra?

5021
05:08:50,350 --> 05:08:51,750
Look at that!

5022
05:08:51,830 --> 05:08:52,730
The thing that I needed.

5023
05:08:55,410 --> 05:08:56,510
This guy is evil?

5024
05:08:56,670 --> 05:08:57,450
He's so beautiful.

5025
05:08:59,890 --> 05:09:01,590
What if I gave her the wrong guy?

5026
05:09:01,690 --> 05:09:02,430
Like that thing.

5027
05:09:04,270 --> 05:09:08,390
Does she know that there is like freaky things in the water here?

5028
05:09:12,140 --> 05:09:13,520
I'll take two just in case.

5029
05:09:25,800 --> 05:09:26,680
Is that...

5030
05:09:27,300 --> 05:09:29,820
The one time I don't need wood.

5031
05:09:31,380 --> 05:09:32,580
Please, game.

5032
05:09:33,260 --> 05:09:34,300
Would you be so kind?

5033
05:09:35,760 --> 05:09:37,660
I don't even know how to find the jellies.

5034
05:09:44,430 --> 05:09:48,170
Like the pretty one that I'm looking for.

5035
05:09:50,270 --> 05:09:52,290
I don't want this guy coming after me.

5036
05:10:12,740 --> 05:10:14,340
Jellies are net only?

5037
05:10:16,820 --> 05:10:17,400
No.

5038
05:10:20,040 --> 05:10:21,760
Surely you jest.

5039
05:10:24,820 --> 05:10:26,280
No way.

5040
05:10:41,700 --> 05:10:45,500
I got a trophy Medusa?

5041
05:10:45,900 --> 05:10:47,260
How much is that guy worth?

5042
05:10:55,350 --> 05:10:56,830
I'm gonna go sell him and see.

5043
05:10:56,830 --> 05:10:56,930
Ok,

5044
05:11:00,150 --> 05:11:03,010
so we need cloth like 100% right now.

5045
05:11:03,230 --> 05:11:04,170
Oh my goodness.

5046
05:11:04,970 --> 05:11:06,810
You guys, it wasn't part of the plan.

5047
05:11:07,930 --> 05:11:09,870
It wasn't part of the plan.

5048
05:11:10,010 --> 05:11:10,810
I messed up.

5049
05:11:13,030 --> 05:11:14,770
I messed up.

5050
05:11:15,430 --> 05:11:17,030
I messed up.

5051
05:11:19,250 --> 05:11:20,610
I messed up.

5052
05:11:21,250 --> 05:11:23,390
It wasn't part of the plan.

5053
05:11:23,390 --> 05:11:23,650
Bad.

5054
05:11:28,030 --> 05:11:29,650
I think I messed up.

5055
05:11:43,560 --> 05:11:44,180
Nice.

5056
05:11:47,950 --> 05:11:49,360
Sell all but one.

5057
05:11:50,920 --> 05:11:52,180
He's still fresh.

5058
05:11:53,140 --> 05:11:54,840
Just in case she needs a new one.

5059
05:11:55,240 --> 05:11:56,640
Actually no, I'm just gonna sell him.

5060
05:12:08,410 --> 05:12:10,510
How much money do I have?

5061
05:12:11,810 --> 05:12:13,570
Almost 800 dollars.

5062
05:12:13,570 --> 05:12:14,170
Oops, sorry.

5063
05:12:21,540 --> 05:12:22,300
No,

5064
05:12:25,380 --> 05:12:26,240
don't do that.

5065
05:12:37,260 --> 05:12:39,440
There's gotta be cloth around here somewhere.

5066
05:12:41,100 --> 05:12:41,760
What are you?

5067
05:12:43,800 --> 05:12:45,320
Your jewelry.

5068
05:12:51,520 --> 05:12:52,680
Sapphire ring.

5069
05:12:53,220 --> 05:12:54,560
Just like the dog barfed up.

5070
05:12:57,060 --> 05:12:58,380
Ma'am, the wood.

5071
05:12:58,540 --> 05:13:00,280
We don't need wood right now.

5072
05:13:02,120 --> 05:13:03,720
We need cloth.

5073
05:13:09,440 --> 05:13:10,600
Maybe like over there.

5074
05:13:29,510 --> 05:13:30,790
So painful.

5075
05:13:38,060 --> 05:13:39,420
It's so painful.

5076
05:13:40,280 --> 05:13:42,040
Oh yeah, we got this too.

5077
05:13:42,040 --> 05:13:43,720
We are engaged to be married.

5078
05:14:05,620 --> 05:14:07,460
My god.

5079
05:14:13,300 --> 05:14:15,580
Then you remember what you said.

5080
05:14:17,840 --> 05:14:19,620
Is that the ring that I found?

5081
05:14:20,960 --> 05:14:22,780
Or the one that the dog barfed up?

5082
05:14:24,740 --> 05:14:26,020
Who is she writing this to?

5083
05:14:42,040 --> 05:14:43,900
To warrant spanning multiple entries.

5084
05:14:44,360 --> 05:14:46,920
Oh, she really did write 6th and 7th.

5085
05:14:56,440 --> 05:14:57,040
Research.

5086
05:15:00,680 --> 05:15:02,080
Here's your little guy.

5087
05:15:03,280 --> 05:15:03,600
Okay.

5088
05:15:04,700 --> 05:15:05,980
Do you have any cloth?

5089
05:15:06,100 --> 05:15:07,940
Can I have the clothes off your back, ma'am?

5090
05:15:09,820 --> 05:15:13,140
Can I please have whatever you're wearing?

5091
05:15:13,940 --> 05:15:15,420
Maybe there's some cloth over here.

5092
05:15:21,310 --> 05:15:23,770
Maybe there's like a camp or something, you know?

5093
05:15:24,970 --> 05:15:26,430
Oh, the music is exciting.

5094
05:15:26,530 --> 05:15:27,100
I like it.

5095
05:15:28,490 --> 05:15:29,390
Where are we anyway?

5096
05:15:30,670 --> 05:15:31,790
Can you go off the map?

5097
05:15:31,850 --> 05:15:32,590
I just noticed.

5098
05:15:33,690 --> 05:15:34,910
How far can we go?

5099
05:15:43,160 --> 05:15:43,660
Nothing.

5100
05:15:44,160 --> 05:15:44,380
Yeah.

5101
05:15:48,000 --> 05:15:49,540
Worst tiny island ever.

5102
05:15:54,880 --> 05:15:56,640
We're almost to the twisted strand.

5103
05:15:58,740 --> 05:16:00,140
You can go pretty far.

5104
05:16:00,240 --> 05:16:00,520
You can.

5105
05:16:02,240 --> 05:16:03,760
That looks like a shipwreck.

5106
05:16:04,880 --> 05:16:06,400
That looks pretty bad.

5107
05:16:07,000 --> 05:16:08,260
That looks like no survivors.

5108
05:16:08,940 --> 05:16:11,900
That looks like maybe there's a skeleton wearing...

5109
05:16:12,520 --> 05:16:13,400
of something.

5110
05:16:19,480 --> 05:16:20,720
Oh my god!

5111
05:16:20,880 --> 05:16:21,060
Wait.

5112
05:16:21,400 --> 05:16:22,060
That's not a shipwreck.

5113
05:16:22,140 --> 05:16:23,240
That's a plane wreck.

5114
05:16:29,590 --> 05:16:30,630
We got...

5115
05:16:30,630 --> 05:16:33,410
What the hell is a sextant?

5116
05:16:39,230 --> 05:16:39,650
Oh!

5117
05:16:39,950 --> 05:16:40,330
Oh

5118
05:16:46,690 --> 05:16:52,610
my god.

5119
05:16:55,810 --> 05:16:59,250
I thought you had clothes.

5120
05:17:09,650 --> 05:17:11,930
Guys, this is looking mighty unfortunate.

5121
05:17:14,330 --> 05:17:16,350
This is looking so unfortunate.

5122
05:17:16,490 --> 05:17:18,050
We're gonna have to backtrack like crazy.

5123
05:17:18,490 --> 05:17:18,790
Oh wait.

5124
05:17:28,220 --> 05:17:28,820
Woah.

5125
05:17:41,130 --> 05:17:42,950
Let's sell our new treasures.

5126
05:17:43,650 --> 05:17:45,530
First let's catch a spooky fish.

5127
05:17:49,510 --> 05:17:50,710
Thank you!

5128
05:17:52,270 --> 05:17:53,630
I'll read it in a second.

5129
05:17:56,850 --> 05:17:58,050
Give me a second.

5130
05:17:59,430 --> 05:18:00,030
Wait.

5131
05:18:00,970 --> 05:18:02,890
Can I fit several guys here?

5132
05:18:04,630 --> 05:18:05,310
There we go.

5133
05:18:08,140 --> 05:18:09,830
Hey, where's my spooky guy?

5134
05:18:13,800 --> 05:18:14,120
What?

5135
05:18:14,240 --> 05:18:14,700
Depleted?

5136
05:18:15,460 --> 05:18:16,360
Aw man.

5137
05:18:22,450 --> 05:18:24,510
Giant enemy crab.

5138
05:18:29,320 --> 05:18:31,170
Yeah, we got scammed for real.

5139
05:18:33,100 --> 05:18:33,970
Hello sir.

5140
05:18:34,370 --> 05:18:36,130
Please buy this tool.

5141
05:18:36,490 --> 05:18:38,370
That has no...

5142
05:18:40,380 --> 05:18:41,310
explicit meaning.

5143
05:18:43,450 --> 05:18:47,210
And also, this ring that was barfed up by a dog.

5144
05:18:47,770 --> 05:18:52,450
And this ring that might have belonged to a family or something.

5145
05:18:52,950 --> 05:18:53,710
I don't know.

5146
05:18:55,370 --> 05:18:55,970
Yes.

5147
05:18:56,970 --> 05:18:57,330
Oh no!

5148
05:18:57,430 --> 05:18:57,850
No wait!

5149
05:18:57,950 --> 05:18:58,510
No no no no no.

5150
05:18:59,190 --> 05:19:00,190
Change flag.

5151
05:19:02,110 --> 05:19:03,290
Next page.

5152
05:19:04,730 --> 05:19:05,430
Pirate flag.

5153
05:19:05,910 --> 05:19:06,810
Thank you.

5154
05:19:06,810 --> 05:19:07,810
Thank you.

5155
05:19:17,430 --> 05:19:18,630
You guys...

5156
05:19:29,270 --> 05:19:31,290
What a wrench in my plans.

5157
05:19:33,350 --> 05:19:34,550
I'm sorry.

5158
05:19:35,770 --> 05:19:37,630
Wow, we have a thousand dollars though.

5159
05:19:39,930 --> 05:19:41,090
What should I buy?

5160
05:19:42,050 --> 05:19:42,510
Hello.

5161
05:19:43,810 --> 05:19:46,050
That crimson glow in the sky seems to have gone away.

5162
05:19:46,150 --> 05:19:47,750
The air feels quieter now.

5163
05:19:47,930 --> 05:19:48,410
We're settled.

5164
05:19:48,410 --> 05:19:49,450
Have you noticed?

5165
05:19:57,230 --> 05:19:58,390
New net.

5166
05:19:58,510 --> 05:20:00,570
I'm working on it.

5167
05:20:03,310 --> 05:20:05,350
I'm working on it.

5168
05:20:13,250 --> 05:20:15,310
I need two flags.

5169
05:20:15,310 --> 05:20:15,590
Five.

5170
05:20:22,310 --> 05:20:24,670
I don't want to buy the old net.

5171
05:20:26,310 --> 05:20:28,250
It's a waste of my money.

5172
05:20:29,950 --> 05:20:31,690
I'm, I'm, I'm...

5173
05:20:32,390 --> 05:20:34,010
I'm... what's the word?

5174
05:20:38,330 --> 05:20:38,970
I'm...

5175
05:20:38,970 --> 05:20:40,850
sticking with this one.

5176
05:20:42,010 --> 05:20:43,730
It's not stubborn.

5177
05:20:43,950 --> 05:20:44,870
I mean, yes, but...

5178
05:20:47,410 --> 05:20:48,690
Yeah, I'm committed.

5179
05:20:48,890 --> 05:20:49,410
I'm committed.

5180
05:20:49,550 --> 05:20:51,250
That's what I was trying to think of.

5181
05:20:51,610 --> 05:20:52,650
I'm committed now.

5182
05:20:54,450 --> 05:20:54,910
Okay.

5183
05:21:01,270 --> 05:21:04,490
Some sweet cloth.

5184
05:21:14,090 --> 05:21:14,810
Depleted.

5185
05:21:17,050 --> 05:21:17,770
Cloth!

5186
05:21:19,530 --> 05:21:21,110
Some more cloth.

5187
05:21:21,350 --> 05:21:22,070
Actually...

5188
05:21:23,830 --> 05:21:26,310
We can always count on this area to have stuff.

5189
05:21:27,410 --> 05:21:29,790
Why not get some more scrap and everything too, right?

5190
05:21:31,410 --> 05:21:33,710
Why not get everything that we can get here?

5191
05:21:35,030 --> 05:21:35,670
Oh, shoot!

5192
05:21:35,790 --> 05:21:36,530
Sorry, I read it wrong.

5193
05:21:49,000 --> 05:21:51,240
Japanese word for cringe is...

5194
05:21:59,840 --> 05:22:00,300
Absolutely.

5195
05:22:04,990 --> 05:22:05,970
Oh, there's more?

5196
05:22:06,170 --> 05:22:06,490
Wow.

5197
05:22:10,920 --> 05:22:11,440
Yeah!

5198
05:22:12,980 --> 05:22:14,020
More scrap!

5199
05:22:20,990 --> 05:22:22,630
And we'll even get some wood.

5200
05:22:23,090 --> 05:22:23,890
We'll get everything.

5201
05:22:25,590 --> 05:22:28,010
We will be not without supplies.

5202
05:22:31,110 --> 05:22:32,390
So much scrap.

5203
05:22:32,510 --> 05:22:32,970
I know.

5204
05:22:33,330 --> 05:22:35,090
We really loaded up on the stuff.

5205
05:22:38,780 --> 05:22:40,840
I wish they gave us more cloth though.

5206
05:22:40,940 --> 05:22:41,880
I'm not gonna lie.

5207
05:22:42,520 --> 05:22:44,280
Why were they so stingy on the cloth?

5208
05:22:45,580 --> 05:22:46,040
Oh!

5209
05:22:47,780 --> 05:22:49,200
A research part.

5210
05:22:49,420 --> 05:22:49,680
Hello?

5211
05:22:57,020 --> 05:22:57,660
Lucky.

5212
05:23:09,680 --> 05:23:13,060
Everyone I've seen play this always struggles with cloth.

5213
05:23:13,160 --> 05:23:13,440
Really?

5214
05:23:14,460 --> 05:23:15,540
So it's not just me?

5215
05:23:16,040 --> 05:23:17,240
That makes me feel a bit better.

5216
05:23:18,360 --> 05:23:20,340
What was I working on?

5217
05:23:21,980 --> 05:23:22,620
You!

5218
05:23:28,080 --> 05:23:31,180
Can you imagine once we get the heavy duty net?

5219
05:23:31,580 --> 05:23:35,580
And then we'll be able to get Oceanic and then we can get a bunch of big boys.

5220
05:23:49,820 --> 05:23:50,700
What's that?

5221
05:23:59,720 --> 05:24:00,840
What was that?

5222
05:24:01,420 --> 05:24:02,260
What was that?

5223
05:24:04,320 --> 05:24:06,160
I just panicked.

5224
05:24:08,360 --> 05:24:09,560
I panicked.

5225
05:24:09,560 --> 05:24:09,620
What?

5226
05:24:22,770 --> 05:24:24,270
Was it the other ship?

5227
05:24:25,450 --> 05:24:27,510
It was a friend.

5228
05:24:29,610 --> 05:24:30,290
Yes.

5229
05:24:32,570 --> 05:24:33,250
Yes.

5230
05:24:35,170 --> 05:24:36,030
Wait a second.

5231
05:24:36,130 --> 05:24:36,810
Is this a big fish?

5232
05:24:39,970 --> 05:24:40,810
I'll take it.

5233
05:24:42,830 --> 05:24:44,530
A bronze whaler.

5234
05:24:45,070 --> 05:24:45,970
I'll do more.

5235
05:24:51,530 --> 05:24:52,410
Oh yeah.

5236
05:25:00,580 --> 05:25:01,780
It is time.

5237
05:25:03,400 --> 05:25:04,700
It is time.

5238
05:25:07,660 --> 05:25:08,860
First we sell.

5239
05:25:11,880 --> 05:25:12,200
Okay.

5240
05:25:12,580 --> 05:25:12,880
Awesome.

5241
05:25:13,740 --> 05:25:15,360
Actually, I might grab...

5242
05:25:16,400 --> 05:25:16,600
Oh.

5243
05:25:16,840 --> 05:25:17,340
Well, hold on.

5244
05:25:18,720 --> 05:25:19,760
Before I...

5245
05:25:20,520 --> 05:25:21,040
You!

5246
05:25:22,800 --> 05:25:22,980
Oh.

5247
05:25:23,120 --> 05:25:23,620
No, no, no, no.

5248
05:25:23,680 --> 05:25:24,320
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

5249
05:25:24,320 --> 05:25:24,960
Dry dock.

5250
05:25:25,400 --> 05:25:25,760
You!

5251
05:25:26,120 --> 05:25:26,940
Net space.

5252
05:25:27,480 --> 05:25:27,700
You!

5253
05:25:28,100 --> 05:25:28,660
You!

5254
05:25:29,480 --> 05:25:30,360
And you!

5255
05:25:31,260 --> 05:25:31,940
Purchase.

5256
05:25:33,380 --> 05:25:33,720
Okay!

5257
05:25:34,820 --> 05:25:35,300
Woohoo!

5258
05:25:36,100 --> 05:25:40,720
We did it.

5259
05:25:43,040 --> 05:25:44,120
A friend.

5260
05:25:44,280 --> 05:25:45,360
Why no friend sound?

5261
05:25:47,580 --> 05:25:49,800
We could also do the light space.

5262
05:25:50,200 --> 05:25:51,180
Or the engine space.

5263
05:25:51,260 --> 05:25:52,020
We could do one or the other.

5264
05:25:53,600 --> 05:25:54,360
Alright.

5265
05:25:54,840 --> 05:25:55,460
Ma'am.

5266
05:25:57,460 --> 05:25:58,460
Install her.

5267
05:25:59,780 --> 05:26:01,140
Six hours!

5268
05:26:02,660 --> 05:26:07,220
Install equipment into every slot of your ship is what the achievement I just got was.

5269
05:26:11,700 --> 05:26:12,460
Okay.

5270
05:26:13,740 --> 05:26:14,320
We did it.

5271
05:26:18,080 --> 05:26:18,840
Perfect.

5272
05:26:31,760 --> 05:26:34,500
We could go for more cargo space.

5273
05:26:46,150 --> 05:26:46,770
Wowee.

5274
05:26:47,810 --> 05:26:49,270
That cleared up everything.

5275
05:26:50,930 --> 05:26:52,810
Again, once again, too cloth.

5276
05:26:53,330 --> 05:26:53,630
But...

5277
05:26:53,630 --> 05:26:55,020
But if I...

5278
05:26:55,950 --> 05:26:56,630
Hold on.

5279
05:26:56,790 --> 05:26:57,670
Well, I didn't sleep.

5280
05:27:00,690 --> 05:27:02,910
I doubt there will be more over there.

5281
05:27:02,990 --> 05:27:05,110
But there might be some around us.

5282
05:27:05,670 --> 05:27:09,100
There might be some in our vicinity that we can...

5283
05:27:12,010 --> 05:27:12,470
Oh!

5284
05:27:13,950 --> 05:27:14,410
Perhaps...

5285
05:27:14,410 --> 05:27:14,980
You know...

5286
05:27:19,590 --> 05:27:20,050
Grab...

5287
05:27:20,050 --> 05:27:20,810
In the...

5288
05:27:23,610 --> 05:27:25,430
Many eyed mackerel.

5289
05:27:26,430 --> 05:27:27,850
Oops, I didn't mean to grab it again.

5290
05:27:28,250 --> 05:27:28,630
There we go.

5291
05:27:28,790 --> 05:27:29,670
Well, it's depleted anyway.

5292
05:27:30,730 --> 05:27:31,310
Oh, my net!

5293
05:27:31,510 --> 05:27:32,150
Yes, thank you.

5294
05:27:34,090 --> 05:27:35,710
We worked hard for this guy.

5295
05:27:42,420 --> 05:27:43,240
Around here?

5296
05:27:44,360 --> 05:27:45,400
That is...

5297
05:27:45,400 --> 05:27:46,420
What appears to be...

5298
05:27:48,360 --> 05:27:50,360
Oh my god, please don't hit the...

5299
05:27:50,360 --> 05:27:51,200
Please don't hit the wall.

5300
05:27:58,500 --> 05:27:59,480
Metal scrap.

5301
05:28:00,900 --> 05:28:01,700
I'll keep dredging.

5302
05:28:32,100 --> 05:28:33,440
Back home, please.

5303
05:28:40,820 --> 05:28:42,220
What the hell are you?

5304
05:28:44,380 --> 05:28:45,260
Oh my gosh.

5305
05:28:45,260 --> 05:28:46,400
Oh my gosh.

5306
05:28:47,380 --> 05:28:48,760
I think we are really crazy.

5307
05:28:49,940 --> 05:28:51,340
We are zooming, we are zooming.

5308
05:28:51,680 --> 05:28:51,760
Oh!

5309
05:28:52,320 --> 05:28:53,300
My, you look exhausted.

5310
05:28:53,640 --> 05:28:55,100
You are not forgetting to get some sleep, are you?

5311
05:28:55,580 --> 05:28:58,740
As I always say, taking frequent breaks is an important part of being productive.

5312
05:29:01,260 --> 05:29:03,580
Yes, what are you doing up at 1 AM, mister?

5313
05:29:08,490 --> 05:29:09,950
I'm going to sleep!

5314
05:29:10,330 --> 05:29:12,410
Is everyone going to tell me how tired I look?

5315
05:29:12,650 --> 05:29:13,050
Yeah!

5316
05:29:13,430 --> 05:29:15,330
They are all telling me how tired I look.

5317
05:29:15,410 --> 05:29:15,930
That's so funny.

5318
05:29:15,930 --> 05:29:17,750
Even the lighthouse keeper?

5319
05:29:18,910 --> 05:29:19,770
Nah, she doesn't care.

5320
05:29:20,070 --> 05:29:22,050
Have you seen anything significant from the lighthouse recently?

5321
05:29:22,570 --> 05:29:23,030
The fog.

5322
05:29:23,750 --> 05:29:24,110
It's behaving...

5323
05:29:24,770 --> 05:29:26,970
It's as though it's reacting to the light that cut through it.

5324
05:29:27,310 --> 05:29:28,950
It swirls and crashes against the edges.

5325
05:29:29,670 --> 05:29:31,730
From the top of the lighthouse, I can see dark figures.

5326
05:29:32,350 --> 05:29:34,330
Seething in the thickest tracks.

5327
05:29:34,750 --> 05:29:37,290
Out beyond Little Marrow, where the lights dwindle.

5328
05:29:38,190 --> 05:29:41,290
Of all that I've seen, your lights seem to anger them the most.

5329
05:29:42,770 --> 05:29:43,210
Interesting.

5330
05:29:43,210 --> 05:29:43,330
Interesting.

5331
05:29:48,100 --> 05:29:49,740
They're seething out there.

5332
05:29:52,800 --> 05:29:57,600
I guess it is time for us to get a new fishing line, huh?

5333
05:30:00,600 --> 05:30:01,740
Start with that one.

5334
05:30:02,080 --> 05:30:02,880
You look a bit sleepy.

5335
05:30:04,060 --> 05:30:06,000
Are they telling me to stop playing the game?

5336
05:30:08,060 --> 05:30:08,400
Never!

5337
05:30:09,660 --> 05:30:10,160
Never!

5338
05:30:11,260 --> 05:30:13,040
What if I go back over here?

5339
05:30:13,040 --> 05:30:15,960
Of all

5340
05:30:21,840 --> 05:30:26,580
the aberrations you've seen so far in the game, which one would you be most curious to eat despite the consequences?

5341
05:30:28,280 --> 05:30:29,400
To eat?

5342
05:30:31,960 --> 05:30:33,920
Dang, they didn't respawn so quickly.

5343
05:30:35,720 --> 05:30:36,920
One could be...

5344
05:30:38,340 --> 05:30:39,180
You know...

5345
05:30:39,460 --> 05:30:40,020
Hopeful.

5346
05:30:40,920 --> 05:30:41,600
Have I been over here?

5347
05:30:42,080 --> 05:30:43,860
The one curious to eat.

5348
05:30:58,080 --> 05:30:59,560
What does exotic count?

5349
05:30:59,680 --> 05:31:00,980
Oh, those are the rare guys, huh?

5350
05:31:01,100 --> 05:31:01,960
Those look pretty rare.

5351
05:31:02,700 --> 05:31:04,060
Eww, grotesque mackerel.

5352
05:31:04,940 --> 05:31:05,380
Lumpy.

5353
05:31:06,100 --> 05:31:06,800
All-seeing cod.

5354
05:31:06,880 --> 05:31:08,680
There's a different kind of cod we haven't caught.

5355
05:31:09,060 --> 05:31:10,780
Third kind of cod we haven't caught.

5356
05:31:14,480 --> 05:31:17,580
I'm a fan of eels, so maybe any sort of eel.

5357
05:31:21,260 --> 05:31:22,660
Like the host eel.

5358
05:31:23,020 --> 05:31:24,480
Actually, no, I don't like fish eggs.

5359
05:31:26,000 --> 05:31:27,080
Shard ray.

5360
05:31:27,300 --> 05:31:28,860
I want that as a pet.

5361
05:31:28,940 --> 05:31:30,540
I don't want that to eat.

5362
05:31:37,310 --> 05:31:39,650
The perch looks so bad.

5363
05:31:40,770 --> 05:31:42,390
The bearded mackerel.

5364
05:31:44,370 --> 05:31:46,830
Eww, enthralled stonefish looks horrible.

5365
05:31:47,650 --> 05:31:48,890
Decaying blackmouth.

5366
05:31:48,970 --> 05:31:50,490
Not gonna lie, it looks really yummy.

5367
05:31:51,330 --> 05:31:53,070
The sprouting eel is also very cute.

5368
05:31:53,950 --> 05:31:55,150
Woah, what is...

5369
05:31:55,150 --> 05:31:57,110
Woah, I want that one.

5370
05:31:57,330 --> 05:31:58,190
Number 97.

5371
05:32:05,860 --> 05:32:06,780
Radiant squid.

5372
05:32:08,180 --> 05:32:09,500
I would eat that.

5373
05:32:11,280 --> 05:32:13,080
I would eat the hell out of that.

5374
05:32:14,300 --> 05:32:15,420
The radiant squid.

5375
05:32:16,900 --> 05:32:18,100
I think everybody can agree.

5376
05:32:22,050 --> 05:32:22,390
Yeah.

5377
05:32:23,070 --> 05:32:23,430
Yeah.

5378
05:32:24,330 --> 05:32:24,930
Yeah.

5379
05:32:28,110 --> 05:32:28,710
Yeah.

5380
05:32:30,830 --> 05:32:31,350
Yeah.

5381
05:32:33,750 --> 05:32:36,130
Look at that tiny boat right there.

5382
05:32:37,270 --> 05:32:37,950
Are you friend?

5383
05:32:40,270 --> 05:32:41,450
Why is your boat so small?

5384
05:32:41,890 --> 05:32:43,470
I'm not shaming, I'm just asking.

5385
05:32:47,010 --> 05:32:49,730
Who goes there?

5386
05:33:00,130 --> 05:33:00,790
A monster.

5387
05:33:01,030 --> 05:33:02,050
Oh my god, are we gonna be mean?

5388
05:33:02,650 --> 05:33:03,330
A monster.

5389
05:33:03,730 --> 05:33:04,470
Very funny.

5390
05:33:05,390 --> 05:33:05,950
What do you want?

5391
05:33:06,830 --> 05:33:07,970
I was just checking to see if you're okay.

5392
05:33:08,590 --> 05:33:09,290
Do I seem okay?

5393
05:33:09,650 --> 05:33:11,110
No, I'm very much not okay.

5394
05:33:11,450 --> 05:33:15,230
I'm supposed to be delivering this package to Little Marrow, but I'm being stalked.

5395
05:33:15,730 --> 05:33:19,310
A huge leviathan lurks in these deep waters.

5396
05:33:19,390 --> 05:33:20,210
I've seen it.

5397
05:33:20,890 --> 05:33:24,330
It hung in the water, its gaping mouth just below the boat.

5398
05:33:25,550 --> 05:33:28,850
It would have swallowed this vessel whole if I hadn't bolted for the shallows.

5399
05:33:28,850 --> 05:33:31,750
I'm not going any further into this accursed island chain.

5400
05:33:32,610 --> 05:33:33,330
I'll deliver it.

5401
05:33:33,410 --> 05:33:33,770
You would?

5402
05:33:33,850 --> 05:33:34,870
Well, that would work, I guess.

5403
05:33:35,690 --> 05:33:37,690
This is actually death stranding.

5404
05:33:39,730 --> 05:33:42,090
This is a strand game for real.

5405
05:33:43,030 --> 05:33:46,070
The courier pushes a lumpy brown package through the door hole.

5406
05:33:46,230 --> 05:33:48,850
It squelches slightly as you take it into your hands.

5407
05:33:49,270 --> 05:33:51,130
Dark fluid oozes from one corner.

5408
05:33:51,210 --> 05:33:54,970
Okay, I was hoping that I was not... that I was just seeing things.

5409
05:33:55,610 --> 05:33:56,550
Thank you, stranger.

5410
05:33:56,850 --> 05:33:59,490
This is bound for the dock worker at Little Marrow.

5411
05:34:00,170 --> 05:34:02,310
I'm not sure what's inside, but listen.

5412
05:34:02,690 --> 05:34:06,530
I know this sounds crazy, but sometimes I think I can hear the faintest of whispers coming from it.

5413
05:34:07,170 --> 05:34:09,130
Now, I'm not supposed to be transporting live goods.

5414
05:34:09,330 --> 05:34:10,550
I don't have the equipment for it.

5415
05:34:10,690 --> 05:34:13,310
So just be careful with this thing, whatever it is.

5416
05:34:13,890 --> 05:34:14,890
Here, why don't you take this too?

5417
05:34:18,270 --> 05:34:19,390
We got a book.

5418
05:34:20,110 --> 05:34:22,130
I'll be on my way whenever the coast is clear.

5419
05:34:22,330 --> 05:34:22,890
Safe travels.

5420
05:34:27,510 --> 05:34:28,210
Cool.

5421
05:34:28,530 --> 05:34:30,110
It's been a minute since we've gotten a book.

5422
05:34:31,790 --> 05:34:34,230
Now, who is the...

5423
05:34:37,320 --> 05:34:39,440
Who is the dock worker?

5424
05:34:47,850 --> 05:34:49,030
Cloth right there.

5425
05:34:49,290 --> 05:34:52,950
There wasn't cloth in there, was it?

5426
05:35:17,000 --> 05:35:17,700
Scrap.

5427
05:35:22,220 --> 05:35:23,600
Behind the rock.

5428
05:35:26,520 --> 05:35:30,440
I'm gonna double check, but you better not be bamboozling me.

5429
05:35:40,160 --> 05:35:40,960
Wait, oh...

5430
05:35:40,960 --> 05:35:42,160
Well, that might be it, actually.

5431
05:35:42,300 --> 05:35:42,880
I think you're right.

5432
05:35:43,320 --> 05:35:43,600
Nope.

5433
05:35:43,740 --> 05:35:44,420
Ah, dang it.

5434
05:35:45,940 --> 05:35:47,180
It looked like it a lot.

5435
05:35:50,200 --> 05:35:51,480
It did look like it.

5436
05:35:51,660 --> 05:35:52,420
I'll be honest.

5437
05:35:53,960 --> 05:35:54,360
Random.

5438
05:35:54,600 --> 05:35:54,860
No!

5439
05:35:56,640 --> 05:35:57,500
What's this one?

5440
05:35:57,620 --> 05:35:59,120
This one looks like some more...

5441
05:35:59,860 --> 05:36:00,540
Whatever, whatever.

5442
05:36:01,100 --> 05:36:01,440
Yeah.

5443
05:36:02,100 --> 05:36:04,340
Probably some more, like, iron.

5444
05:36:05,180 --> 05:36:06,220
Iron stuff.

5445
05:36:07,560 --> 05:36:08,600
Broken monocle.

5446
05:36:13,890 --> 05:36:16,850
This is definitely not, but I'll grab it anyway.

5447
05:36:17,070 --> 05:36:18,630
Because we're already on our way over there.

5448
05:36:23,870 --> 05:36:25,490
Another broken monocle.

5449
05:36:26,470 --> 05:36:28,390
A lot of nerds died here.

5450
05:36:28,450 --> 05:36:29,510
What if it's not a monocle?

5451
05:36:29,590 --> 05:36:31,810
What if it's the second half of the glasses?

5452
05:36:44,080 --> 05:36:45,460
Something after me?

5453
05:36:53,500 --> 05:36:54,220
Wait.

5454
05:36:54,220 --> 05:36:54,940
Back.

5455
05:37:06,310 --> 05:37:08,290
Look how cute they are.

5456
05:37:08,990 --> 05:37:10,110
Oh, they're traveling.

5457
05:37:10,750 --> 05:37:12,130
Oh, we'll get the sunset in the background.

5458
05:37:13,950 --> 05:37:14,490
Let's roll.

5459
05:37:15,990 --> 05:37:16,710
Yay!

5460
05:37:20,590 --> 05:37:21,110
Yay!

5461
05:37:26,430 --> 05:37:28,190
I thought something was after me.

5462
05:37:28,490 --> 05:37:29,590
Can't trust this game.

5463
05:37:34,510 --> 05:37:35,890
A dock worker.

5464
05:37:36,630 --> 05:37:37,650
That guy over here?

5465
05:37:44,180 --> 05:37:45,080
Oh yeah, here he is.

5466
05:37:45,880 --> 05:37:47,140
How's the day treating you?

5467
05:37:47,420 --> 05:37:48,400
I got a package for you.

5468
05:37:48,580 --> 05:37:49,860
A delivery, eh?

5469
05:37:50,200 --> 05:37:51,020
Oh, it's a big one.

5470
05:37:51,080 --> 05:37:51,640
Let me see.

5471
05:37:53,880 --> 05:37:57,480
He takes the large package and examines it gently with his hands.

5472
05:37:57,480 --> 05:37:59,600
He lifts it to one ear and listens for a while.

5473
05:38:00,040 --> 05:38:01,440
He seems satisfied.

5474
05:38:03,680 --> 05:38:04,880
Much appreciated, friend.

5475
05:38:05,060 --> 05:38:06,940
Now if you'll excuse me, wish me luck.

5476
05:38:07,120 --> 05:38:08,660
What is everybody doing?

5477
05:38:13,120 --> 05:38:17,420
He turns and hurries up down the dock without another word to you.

5478
05:38:17,560 --> 05:38:18,460
Or compensation.

5479
05:38:19,840 --> 05:38:20,280
Jerk.

5480
05:38:30,470 --> 05:38:32,250
I don't have anything in storage, right?

5481
05:38:40,890 --> 05:38:41,430
Erm...

5482
05:38:41,430 --> 05:38:42,150
What should we do?

5483
05:38:47,660 --> 05:38:49,040
Let's go sell our fish.

5484
05:38:50,920 --> 05:38:52,620
And then we'll go back to the lady.

5485
05:38:55,880 --> 05:38:57,960
We'll find cloth elsewhere as well.

5486
05:38:58,560 --> 05:38:59,780
We'll find more cloth eventually.

5487
05:39:05,800 --> 05:39:06,560
It's okay.

5488
05:39:08,200 --> 05:39:08,740
Alright.

5489
05:39:12,000 --> 05:39:12,740
And sleep.

5490
05:39:14,120 --> 05:39:15,740
Full speed at the dock.

5491
05:39:15,820 --> 05:39:17,620
Yeah, I don't have time to waste.

5492
05:39:18,800 --> 05:39:20,640
I don't have time to waste.

5493
05:39:29,640 --> 05:39:31,140
It's like this way, right?

5494
05:39:32,940 --> 05:39:34,220
Yeah, pretty much.

5495
05:39:39,950 --> 05:39:41,650
There might be some over here actually.

5496
05:39:43,630 --> 05:39:44,590
Let's check here.

5497
05:39:46,330 --> 05:39:47,790
Are you oceanic?

5498
05:39:52,040 --> 05:39:52,660
Tempting.

5499
05:39:53,660 --> 05:39:54,980
Dang it, it's wood.

5500
05:39:56,160 --> 05:39:58,660
Of course, when I don't need anymore wood.

5501
05:40:01,720 --> 05:40:03,780
But I shall grab it regardless.

5502
05:40:18,740 --> 05:40:21,000
I'm such a fan of this game, you guys.

5503
05:40:24,040 --> 05:40:26,980
This is the comfort I've been craving.

5504
05:40:35,510 --> 05:40:36,570
Silver necklace.

5505
05:40:38,610 --> 05:40:39,950
It's neat, yeah.

5506
05:40:41,870 --> 05:40:43,470
I have room for this.

5507
05:40:44,610 --> 05:40:45,570
It's probably fine.

5508
05:40:48,050 --> 05:40:50,010
There are so many birds.

5509
05:40:56,240 --> 05:40:56,880
Lucky!

5510
05:40:58,040 --> 05:41:00,120
Do you ever think about how goofy is a father?

5511
05:41:00,460 --> 05:41:05,020
I don't want to think about what he's doing to become a father.

5512
05:41:09,160 --> 05:41:11,120
You got me all distracted.

5513
05:41:13,880 --> 05:41:16,780
And how can I... I think about this every now and then.

5514
05:41:16,960 --> 05:41:17,320
No!

5515
05:41:17,660 --> 05:41:18,920
Why would you think about this?

5516
05:41:25,550 --> 05:41:26,770
Another research part!

5517
05:41:26,850 --> 05:41:27,950
You guys were killing it.

5518
05:41:28,150 --> 05:41:28,670
Oh my god.

5519
05:41:29,330 --> 05:41:29,690
Wait.

5520
05:41:30,210 --> 05:41:31,350
This is insane.

5521
05:41:37,340 --> 05:41:38,220
Let's get out of here.

5522
05:41:42,860 --> 05:41:44,320
Is that guy going to come towards me?

5523
05:41:47,840 --> 05:41:48,240
Oh oh.

5524
05:42:13,000 --> 05:42:14,780
That was so scary.

5525
05:42:17,140 --> 05:42:18,380
What did I lose?

5526
05:42:19,520 --> 05:42:21,620
I lost some scrap, but that's ok.

5527
05:42:22,940 --> 05:42:24,160
Scrap is scrap.

5528
05:42:24,540 --> 05:42:25,540
We have so much scrap.

5529
05:42:27,320 --> 05:42:28,400
We'll lose the scrap.

5530
05:42:29,680 --> 05:42:31,220
Yeah, we'll lose the scrap.

5531
05:42:31,400 --> 05:42:34,860
Scrap is probably the best thing we could have lost there, honestly.

5532
05:42:44,940 --> 05:42:48,720
We can get a new thing though.

5533
05:42:53,820 --> 05:42:56,980
I'm almost tempted to start research on this guy even.

5534
05:42:57,960 --> 05:42:59,140
It's the same amount.

5535
05:43:01,860 --> 05:43:03,080
I'm gonna do it.

5536
05:43:07,800 --> 05:43:08,420
Thank you.

5537
05:43:11,820 --> 05:43:12,540
Thank you.

5538
05:43:13,740 --> 05:43:16,020
If you want the DLC, get it before you beat the game.

5539
05:43:16,120 --> 05:43:17,100
There's no story spoilers.

5540
05:43:17,260 --> 05:43:18,680
It adds more stuff to do in each zone.

5541
05:43:19,100 --> 05:43:21,820
But if your ship is upgraded when you start the DLC, it feels too easy.

5542
05:43:22,960 --> 05:43:24,180
I see, I see.

5543
05:43:25,780 --> 05:43:27,060
I will keep that in mind.

5544
05:43:29,820 --> 05:43:30,520
Thank you.

5545
05:43:43,190 --> 05:43:43,990
Ok.

5546
05:43:52,560 --> 05:43:53,360
Alright.

5547
05:43:55,120 --> 05:43:58,920
Let's go actually to where we were going to go before.

5548
05:44:01,460 --> 05:44:04,480
That dang ship really spoiled my mood.

5549
05:44:08,460 --> 05:44:14,640
That guy threw a wrench in my plans.

5550
05:44:15,160 --> 05:44:15,740
Thank you.

5551
05:44:16,860 --> 05:44:17,420
Maple.

5552
05:44:18,480 --> 05:44:20,120
Maple sides.

5553
05:44:31,080 --> 05:44:33,180
Gosh, we make it there so quickly now.

5554
05:44:36,660 --> 05:44:38,760
Maybe there's some cloth here?

5555
05:44:40,880 --> 05:44:41,940
Right in here?

5556
05:44:43,020 --> 05:44:43,500
Cloth.

5557
05:44:44,440 --> 05:44:45,760
I don't think... I think that's scrap.

5558
05:44:46,500 --> 05:44:46,780
Yep.

5559
05:44:48,060 --> 05:44:49,240
No more scrap at the moment.

5560
05:44:49,360 --> 05:44:49,740
Thank you.

5561
05:44:49,980 --> 05:44:50,420
I'm full.

5562
05:44:53,440 --> 05:44:55,280
See, I wanna get these guys.

5563
05:44:55,480 --> 05:44:56,140
Look at that.

5564
05:44:59,720 --> 05:45:01,200
I can see them.

5565
05:45:04,120 --> 05:45:06,540
Alright, now we wait until night time.

5566
05:45:06,960 --> 05:45:11,180
We can get the jelly and then we can complete the mission.

5567
05:45:12,160 --> 05:45:13,120
And all is well.

5568
05:45:13,880 --> 05:45:14,640
What about this?

5569
05:45:15,580 --> 05:45:16,500
Is he gonna get mad at me?

5570
05:45:30,550 --> 05:45:32,190
He got mad at me.

5571
05:45:36,980 --> 05:45:37,500
Okay.

5572
05:45:39,160 --> 05:45:41,100
I think he got mad at me.

5573
05:45:43,440 --> 05:45:45,420
I just repaired you.

5574
05:45:47,440 --> 05:45:50,460
It's okay, we're making money as we swim along.

5575
05:45:55,760 --> 05:45:58,540
She just wanted to get grabbed by the tentacles a little bit.

5576
05:45:58,580 --> 05:45:59,200
As a treat.

5577
05:46:03,070 --> 05:46:04,990
I don't know if I'm in the tentacles.

5578
05:46:06,770 --> 05:46:07,910
How would you know?

5579
05:46:09,010 --> 05:46:11,090
I guess if you just see it and you're like ooh la la.

5580
05:46:12,130 --> 05:46:12,890
How do you know?

5581
05:46:21,050 --> 05:46:23,570
What the hell is making all that noise over there?

5582
05:46:27,180 --> 05:46:28,420
If you know, you know.

5583
05:46:35,760 --> 05:46:36,900
Alright, undock.

5584
05:46:41,060 --> 05:46:42,120
Catch more fish.

5585
05:46:44,580 --> 05:46:45,800
Catch more fish.

5586
05:46:47,280 --> 05:46:50,720
I can send you reference material.

5587
05:46:51,260 --> 05:47:00,820
You know, if you need a little study session.

5588
05:47:04,920 --> 05:47:06,900
This thing is so gross.

5589
05:47:09,040 --> 05:47:09,960
Nasty.

5590
05:47:09,960 --> 05:47:10,000
Nasty.

5591
05:47:13,720 --> 05:47:15,380
Ew, look at his face.

5592
05:47:17,940 --> 05:47:20,120
Alright, let's go sell these guys.

5593
05:47:23,980 --> 05:47:24,980
Ooh, it's red.

5594
05:47:27,760 --> 05:47:29,260
He's got your colors.

5595
05:47:32,100 --> 05:47:33,340
But like...

5596
05:47:35,620 --> 05:47:37,500
I don't look like a...

5597
05:47:37,500 --> 05:47:39,400
Like a zombie Mew...

5598
05:47:39,400 --> 05:47:41,920
Do I look like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle to you?

5599
05:47:48,640 --> 05:47:50,360
What's this spooky music for?

5600
05:47:51,660 --> 05:47:52,300
Cut it out.

5601
05:47:53,060 --> 05:47:54,740
Cut it out, game.

5602
05:48:00,430 --> 05:48:02,330
It's like kind of my colors.

5603
05:48:02,990 --> 05:48:03,570
Stop it.

5604
05:48:11,780 --> 05:48:12,420
Donaminto.

5605
05:48:14,560 --> 05:48:15,200
Minta...Minta...

5606
05:48:15,200 --> 05:48:15,820
Wait.

5607
05:48:16,840 --> 05:48:17,480
Michelangelo.

5608
05:48:18,800 --> 05:48:19,440
Mintagelio.

5609
05:48:19,800 --> 05:48:21,120
Wait, I can't say it.

5610
05:48:23,160 --> 05:48:25,100
Can you say cowabunga?

5611
05:48:32,970 --> 05:48:34,770
Woo, 400 bucks.

5612
05:48:35,510 --> 05:48:36,090
Let's go.

5613
05:48:36,210 --> 05:48:39,010
Okay, I'm gonna buy this large crab pot now.

5614
05:48:39,610 --> 05:48:41,170
And we're gonna set it up...

5615
05:48:42,810 --> 05:48:44,280
We're gonna set it up...

5616
05:48:45,710 --> 05:48:46,810
Right here.

5617
05:48:50,700 --> 05:48:54,860
Does it matter if it's in like shallow or deep or whatever?

5618
05:48:55,720 --> 05:48:56,860
Like totally, dude.

5619
05:48:57,880 --> 05:48:58,840
Like totally, dude.

5620
05:49:02,100 --> 05:49:03,520
What, do you guys see it?

5621
05:49:03,920 --> 05:49:05,680
The aurora borealis!

5622
05:49:06,180 --> 05:49:07,480
Oh my gosh, propose right now.

5623
05:49:09,460 --> 05:49:11,400
And then the dog will eat your ring.

5624
05:49:11,400 --> 05:49:13,900
And then it will throw it up.

5625
05:49:17,850 --> 05:49:19,430
Alright, there's time over here.

5626
05:49:27,070 --> 05:49:28,550
Minky, would you please...

5627
05:49:29,070 --> 05:49:30,890
Please use my family name.

5628
05:49:32,970 --> 05:49:33,430
Oh my god.

5629
05:49:37,790 --> 05:49:40,490
I gotta get away from the...

5630
05:49:42,470 --> 05:49:44,690
From the spooky mist.

5631
05:49:46,670 --> 05:49:50,450
What lies entirely in this basin?

5632
05:49:51,470 --> 05:49:52,330
Oh, what was that sound?

5633
05:49:54,990 --> 05:49:55,770
Oh, it's this.

5634
05:50:00,010 --> 05:50:02,690
Do you think we got it yet or...

5635
05:50:03,770 --> 05:50:05,430
Oh, we got that.

5636
05:50:07,450 --> 05:50:08,370
No, no, no.

5637
05:50:08,530 --> 05:50:09,490
No sir, no.

5638
05:50:11,510 --> 05:50:13,350
Check your net, that's what I'm about to do.

5639
05:50:13,350 --> 05:50:15,670
We got it!

5640
05:50:19,320 --> 05:50:20,340
About the specimens.

5641
05:50:22,020 --> 05:50:23,580
I'm glad she's still awake.

5642
05:50:24,240 --> 05:50:24,840
It's 1AM.

5643
05:50:26,240 --> 05:50:26,700
Thank you.

5644
05:50:26,900 --> 05:50:29,100
Looks like you've caught all the surface specimens I need.

5645
05:50:31,800 --> 05:50:33,160
Oh, the dog!

5646
05:50:36,250 --> 05:50:37,390
It eats the ring.

5647
05:50:40,110 --> 05:50:41,690
Oh no, he doesn't feel so good.

5648
05:50:42,770 --> 05:50:44,050
He threw up the ring.

5649
05:50:45,370 --> 05:50:47,430
And that is the circle of life.

5650
05:50:49,430 --> 05:50:53,490
I do need some from deeper down, but that's going to be a problem.

5651
05:50:54,770 --> 05:50:56,990
I don't have the equipment to catch anything deeper anyway.

5652
05:50:57,690 --> 05:51:00,490
I developed a device to retrieve samples from the abyssal zone.

5653
05:51:01,330 --> 05:51:05,010
This was over in the other research outpost before the attack.

5654
05:51:05,490 --> 05:51:08,870
I have an idea of how to keep the creature at bay long enough to collect those samples.

5655
05:51:08,870 --> 05:51:13,370
But while I work on that, I need you to retrieve some prototype parts.

5656
05:51:14,030 --> 05:51:15,950
Carefully, I suggest you go during the day.

5657
05:51:16,310 --> 05:51:19,050
I wouldn't want to be out on the reef at night.

5658
05:51:19,530 --> 05:51:20,270
Is there anything else?

5659
05:51:21,050 --> 05:51:21,470
No?

5660
05:51:21,750 --> 05:51:22,010
Okay.

5661
05:51:22,850 --> 05:51:23,690
I sleep?

5662
05:51:27,190 --> 05:51:29,370
I've been in love with you since Shadow Moses.

5663
05:51:33,090 --> 05:51:33,930
Okay, Otacon.

5664
05:51:41,120 --> 05:51:41,560
Alrighty.

5665
05:51:42,500 --> 05:51:44,640
Is that a quote straight from the Mufasa movie?

5666
05:51:46,920 --> 05:51:47,700
I don't remember.

5667
05:51:49,860 --> 05:51:51,560
They do talk about the circle of life.

5668
05:51:52,200 --> 05:51:54,780
But he talks about how he thinks the circle of life is stupid.

5669
05:51:55,780 --> 05:51:57,920
And he also was just like, she lives in you.

5670
05:52:01,360 --> 05:52:02,240
Like, um...

5671
05:52:02,240 --> 05:52:03,760
I don't know what you're talking about, buddy.

5672
05:52:04,800 --> 05:52:06,880
Alright, let's grab our stuff.

5673
05:52:07,560 --> 05:52:09,880
Look on the equipment table on the table.

5674
05:52:11,420 --> 05:52:12,220
Prototype parts.

5675
05:52:13,880 --> 05:52:14,180
Okay.

5676
05:52:16,580 --> 05:52:18,060
Anything... I don't think there was anything else.

5677
05:52:18,980 --> 05:52:19,140
Oh!

5678
05:52:19,300 --> 05:52:20,380
No, no, no, no, wake up, wake up!

5679
05:52:22,120 --> 05:52:22,700
Wake up!

5680
05:52:23,340 --> 05:52:25,220
They were waking, waking, waking, waking...

5681
05:52:26,880 --> 05:52:28,700
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle...

5682
05:52:28,700 --> 05:52:30,480
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle...

5683
05:52:30,480 --> 05:52:32,500
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle...

5684
05:52:32,500 --> 05:52:33,740
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle...

5685
05:53:04,640 --> 05:53:06,680
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

5686
05:53:07,240 --> 05:53:09,900
I... have no space.

5687
05:53:11,020 --> 05:53:13,040
Could you make this three times smaller?

5688
05:53:28,520 --> 05:53:29,480
Okay.

5689
05:53:29,480 --> 05:53:32,040
Connected to the researcher's outpost generator.

5690
05:53:34,040 --> 05:53:34,240
Okay.

5691
05:53:34,240 --> 05:53:36,780
Take a look at the list of specimens.

5692
05:53:37,080 --> 05:53:41,680
Remember, you'll want to install and activate the machine before attempting to collect these.

5693
05:53:42,200 --> 05:53:45,500
You might also need to improve that equipment I gave you to catch some of these.

5694
05:53:48,060 --> 05:53:48,580
Okay!

5695
05:53:48,580 --> 05:53:48,640
Yay!

5696
05:54:00,310 --> 05:54:03,510
I'm sure some of these we don't have... I mean...

5697
05:54:04,330 --> 05:54:04,610
Okay.

5698
05:54:09,030 --> 05:54:09,590
Let's...

5699
05:54:09,590 --> 05:54:12,430
So about that research...

5700
05:54:14,090 --> 05:54:14,650
Alright!

5701
05:54:15,210 --> 05:54:16,150
Welcome to Bamboo Ship.

5702
05:54:16,310 --> 05:54:17,070
Thank you!

5703
05:54:19,970 --> 05:54:20,490
So...

5704
05:54:21,010 --> 05:54:23,250
My crabs are going crazy!

5705
05:54:26,010 --> 05:54:28,170
That's not a crab!

5706
05:54:31,870 --> 05:54:33,950
He's having...

5707
05:54:33,950 --> 05:54:36,190
He's having...

5708
05:54:37,070 --> 05:54:38,530
Identity issues.

5709
05:54:39,670 --> 05:54:40,790
To the generator.

5710
05:54:40,910 --> 05:54:41,590
In a moment.

5711
05:54:43,790 --> 05:54:45,690
First I'm gonna sell all my fish.

5712
05:54:47,070 --> 05:54:48,290
Look at that guy!

5713
05:54:48,350 --> 05:54:49,610
He's crazy looking!

5714
05:54:50,630 --> 05:54:52,370
Stinging spiked tentacles.

5715
05:54:53,250 --> 05:54:54,090
Trail of love.

5716
05:54:57,450 --> 05:55:01,690
Do you think maybe we should have... Well, obviously we have to have her install it.

5717
05:55:03,230 --> 05:55:04,430
It's just...

5718
05:55:07,150 --> 05:55:09,930
We have to get rid of our oceanic it seems.

5719
05:55:11,210 --> 05:55:11,810
Wait.

5720
05:55:13,210 --> 05:55:13,810
Actually...

5721
05:55:13,810 --> 05:55:15,250
Not research.

5722
05:55:16,690 --> 05:55:17,430
Floating dock.

5723
05:55:24,200 --> 05:55:26,040
Even that would not be enough.

5724
05:55:36,340 --> 05:55:38,000
Why is it like this?

5725
05:55:38,420 --> 05:55:40,180
Why can't you both be on the same side?

5726
05:55:50,940 --> 05:55:52,420
There's a better one you can research?

5727
05:55:55,940 --> 05:55:57,220
Well, yeah, I mean...

5728
05:55:58,400 --> 05:56:00,140
There's a lot of things I can research.

5729
05:56:02,520 --> 05:56:03,640
This is so stinky.

5730
05:56:10,620 --> 05:56:14,240
But also, I have no research point, so I can't even research.

5731
05:56:32,690 --> 05:56:34,010
It's just how it is.

5732
05:56:37,950 --> 05:56:40,790
Oh wait, I can research more stuff after I...

5733
05:56:40,790 --> 05:56:42,290
After I install it?

5734
05:56:42,470 --> 05:56:43,050
Wait, let me see.

5735
05:56:45,550 --> 05:56:46,550
Oh, there it is!

5736
05:56:50,490 --> 05:56:52,910
OK, we just gotta get one.

5737
05:56:53,910 --> 05:56:55,150
We just gotta get one!

5738
05:56:56,890 --> 05:56:58,070
But it's huge!

5739
05:56:59,790 --> 05:57:01,050
It takes up...

5740
05:57:01,050 --> 05:57:02,670
It takes up the whole thing?

5741
05:57:08,130 --> 05:57:09,750
Shiny in the distance.

5742
05:57:15,450 --> 05:57:17,310
Shiny still in the distance.

5743
05:57:20,350 --> 05:57:22,110
Mist in the distance!

5744
05:57:24,230 --> 05:57:25,970
Stinking mist man.

5745
05:57:28,710 --> 05:57:29,190
Nonononononono!

5746
05:57:29,290 --> 05:57:30,130
Please leave me alone!

5747
05:57:36,520 --> 05:57:38,000
The slowest docking ever.

5748
05:57:40,480 --> 05:57:42,360
Turn off your lights near the fog?

5749
05:57:42,400 --> 05:57:43,180
Is that how that works?

5750
05:57:49,500 --> 05:57:51,600
You don't need to equip it to open research.

5751
05:57:52,860 --> 05:57:54,260
I mean, I did just then.

5752
05:57:54,760 --> 05:57:55,820
It didn't let me before.

5753
05:57:57,680 --> 05:57:58,380
I'm just gonna sleep.

5754
05:58:00,320 --> 05:58:01,200
I'm gonna sleep.

5755
05:58:02,400 --> 05:58:03,000
Whatever.

5756
05:58:06,610 --> 05:58:07,210
Undock.

5757
05:58:07,770 --> 05:58:09,250
Alright, now we go back.

5758
05:58:10,790 --> 05:58:12,210
One moment please.

5759
05:58:14,130 --> 05:58:15,330
Blue crab!

5760
05:58:18,150 --> 05:58:19,310
Isn't that a rare?

5761
05:58:24,460 --> 05:58:25,880
Good morning, Minto.

5762
05:58:34,820 --> 05:58:37,880
Before we do this, I want to...

5763
05:58:37,880 --> 05:58:39,160
There is some over here, you know.

5764
05:58:40,440 --> 05:58:42,920
I want to see what's over in this direction.

5765
05:58:45,200 --> 05:58:46,920
About these guys right here.

5766
05:58:47,240 --> 05:58:48,220
These guys right here.

5767
05:58:54,550 --> 05:58:55,870
Where are you leading me?

5768
05:59:14,830 --> 05:59:17,510
This thing is...

5769
05:59:17,510 --> 05:59:17,930
Icky.

5770
05:59:22,780 --> 05:59:23,680
P.N.

5771
05:59:24,620 --> 05:59:25,780
Do you guys remember that game?

5772
05:59:25,780 --> 05:59:26,500
P.N.

5773
05:59:33,610 --> 05:59:35,690
I don't think I ever played it though.

5774
05:59:36,870 --> 05:59:38,150
Alright, what's that thing?

5775
05:59:38,250 --> 05:59:39,550
Giant Amphipod!

5776
05:59:39,610 --> 05:59:40,610
Oh my god, so cute!

5777
05:59:41,150 --> 05:59:42,110
Snail fish.

5778
05:59:47,260 --> 05:59:51,080
I do need this though, to catch the snail fish in the Amphipod.

5779
05:59:51,560 --> 05:59:51,940
No!

5780
05:59:53,500 --> 05:59:54,520
Oh my god.

5781
05:59:55,480 --> 05:59:57,300
Can I just...

5782
05:59:58,520 --> 06:00:00,080
Lady, why didn't you...

5783
06:00:00,080 --> 06:00:01,960
You wouldn't have been able to do your own research.

5784
06:00:06,400 --> 06:00:07,540
Never heard of it?

5785
06:00:08,980 --> 06:00:11,640
It was the...

5786
06:00:11,640 --> 06:00:15,260
It was like a horror meme game where you played...

5787
06:00:17,140 --> 06:00:21,460
You ran away from a guy with a P.N.

5788
06:00:21,580 --> 06:00:21,960
face.

5789
06:00:25,760 --> 06:00:26,720
Like the...

5790
06:00:26,720 --> 06:00:31,060
And he just chased you.

5791
06:00:31,240 --> 06:00:32,260
And it goes, P.N.

5792
06:00:36,520 --> 06:00:38,300
Oh wait, there's the guys I need here.

5793
06:00:48,360 --> 06:00:48,780
Anglerfish.

5794
06:00:59,240 --> 06:01:00,900
Check the fishing spot behind you.

5795
06:01:01,440 --> 06:01:01,840
This one?

5796
06:01:03,300 --> 06:01:04,980
But I can't get into this one though.

5797
06:01:06,460 --> 06:01:07,620
Wait, this is... Oh, this one?

5798
06:01:08,160 --> 06:01:08,560
Right here?

5799
06:01:10,480 --> 06:01:11,780
I can't do it yet.

5800
06:01:13,380 --> 06:01:14,580
Why I still hear a dog?

5801
06:01:28,010 --> 06:01:31,670
There's a game like that where you have to stop possessed idle otaku.

5802
06:01:34,670 --> 06:01:36,530
I feel like I've played that game before.

5803
06:01:38,890 --> 06:01:40,770
That groper was abyssal.

5804
06:01:41,170 --> 06:01:41,610
Too bad.

5805
06:01:42,010 --> 06:01:42,530
It's okay.

5806
06:01:44,190 --> 06:01:45,050
It's okay.

5807
06:01:50,490 --> 06:01:51,530
Hello ma'am.

5808
06:01:52,150 --> 06:01:53,110
Yo fish.

5809
06:01:55,310 --> 06:01:57,110
We got a lot of red snapper.

5810
06:01:57,110 --> 06:01:58,690
And a blood snapper.

5811
06:01:59,050 --> 06:02:04,670
Blood leaks endlessly from under its scales, pooling beneath it no matter where it's placed.

5812
06:02:15,610 --> 06:02:16,970
So metal.

5813
06:02:24,310 --> 06:02:27,370
When looking for someone to possess, do you single out idle otaku?

5814
06:02:32,130 --> 06:02:33,490
Not quite.

5815
06:02:33,990 --> 06:02:36,730
Really just what I'm in the mood for.

5816
06:02:39,450 --> 06:02:40,850
You know?

5817
06:02:41,710 --> 06:02:46,030
Sometimes idle otaku taste yummy in their life force.

5818
06:02:50,210 --> 06:02:56,970
But ultimately all otaku have poor diets.

5819
06:03:00,280 --> 06:03:02,260
Likes a little bit of variety.

5820
06:03:05,880 --> 06:03:07,520
What's in here?

5821
06:03:11,980 --> 06:03:12,580
Wait.

5822
06:03:13,200 --> 06:03:14,680
Our blue crab is stale.

5823
06:03:15,140 --> 06:03:16,120
I should sell him, huh?

5824
06:03:19,420 --> 06:03:20,440
The call out.

5825
06:03:20,560 --> 06:03:20,980
It's okay.

5826
06:03:21,320 --> 06:03:22,280
I'm an otaku too.

5827
06:03:22,400 --> 06:03:26,120
I have bad eating habits too.

5828
06:03:31,760 --> 06:03:32,360
Glistening.

5829
06:03:32,420 --> 06:03:34,460
This thing looks so Junji Ito-esque.

5830
06:03:35,080 --> 06:03:39,680
Glistening purple strings sprout from solid rock, tying and untying themselves.

5831
06:03:40,140 --> 06:03:42,840
They fall away and wither, making way for new knots.

5832
06:03:44,040 --> 06:03:44,760
So wait.

5833
06:03:44,820 --> 06:03:46,120
It's not even a crab.

5834
06:03:46,200 --> 06:03:46,920
It's a rock?

5835
06:03:52,140 --> 06:03:53,900
Guys, we have so much money now.

5836
06:03:55,840 --> 06:03:57,200
We are making bank.

5837
06:03:57,260 --> 06:03:58,260
We have $2,000.

5838
06:03:58,260 --> 06:03:58,540
$2 ,000.

5839
06:03:58,920 --> 06:04:02,860
If only I had cloth.

5840
06:04:03,220 --> 06:04:07,860
$2,000 and not enough money to buy a dang cloth.

5841
06:04:10,400 --> 06:04:11,640
I also... Oh wait.

5842
06:04:12,200 --> 06:04:12,580
You know what?

5843
06:04:12,940 --> 06:04:14,180
I'm buying the research part.

5844
06:04:15,060 --> 06:04:15,720
Screw it.

5845
06:04:22,360 --> 06:04:23,640
Fathomless winch.

5846
06:04:25,580 --> 06:04:27,920
Fishing speed 82%.

5847
06:04:29,420 --> 06:04:31,120
She did have another one.

5848
06:04:31,360 --> 06:04:31,680
You know what?

5849
06:04:31,720 --> 06:04:34,540
I'm going to buy it because why not?

5850
06:04:39,840 --> 06:04:41,340
I have a lot of money.

5851
06:04:44,080 --> 06:04:47,920
And I'm going to use it towards this bad boy.

5852
06:04:49,640 --> 06:04:50,740
Winch my beloved.

5853
06:04:52,020 --> 06:04:53,760
I'm going to use it towards that bad boy.

5854
06:04:53,760 --> 06:04:57,760
I think if you have this and this, that's all you need, no?

5855
06:05:00,060 --> 06:05:00,460
Technically.

5856
06:05:08,720 --> 06:05:09,800
No room for net.

5857
06:05:10,000 --> 06:05:11,980
Yeah, you would have to get rid of the net.

5858
06:05:12,740 --> 06:05:13,380
So sad.

5859
06:05:24,300 --> 06:05:26,120
Oh, we're almost getting over it.

5860
06:05:26,220 --> 06:05:27,340
We're almost done getting over it.

5861
06:05:27,340 --> 06:05:27,900
Yeah.

5862
06:05:31,660 --> 06:05:33,100
What was I doing?

5863
06:05:33,520 --> 06:05:34,500
Oh, let's sleep.

5864
06:05:36,460 --> 06:05:37,580
And then...

5865
06:05:40,910 --> 06:05:43,530
I forgot to buy the...

5866
06:05:43,870 --> 06:05:45,750
I forgot to buy it and install it.

5867
06:05:45,890 --> 06:05:47,450
I like to install the stuff at night.

5868
06:05:48,170 --> 06:05:48,730
You know?

5869
06:05:52,030 --> 06:05:53,150
So that...

5870
06:05:55,730 --> 06:05:56,850
I can...

5871
06:06:00,040 --> 06:06:01,560
Not worry about it.

5872
06:06:01,560 --> 06:06:02,340
Four hours!

5873
06:06:12,550 --> 06:06:14,030
I was so aggressive.

5874
06:06:14,170 --> 06:06:14,550
Wake up!

5875
06:06:15,170 --> 06:06:15,570
Wake up!

5876
06:06:16,670 --> 06:06:17,770
We got another blue crab.

5877
06:06:18,510 --> 06:06:19,070
Very cute.

5878
06:06:27,990 --> 06:06:30,950
I guess I have this thing in my inventory.

5879
06:06:34,030 --> 06:06:36,810
Time to cause a panic.

5880
06:06:41,050 --> 06:06:43,170
What did I get?

5881
06:06:44,930 --> 06:06:49,530
10% chance to not reduce fish stocks when catching a fish with a rod.

5882
06:07:13,120 --> 06:07:14,640
One moment.

5883
06:07:18,240 --> 06:07:20,020
I can research here.

5884
06:07:32,370 --> 06:07:33,250
Generator.

5885
06:07:33,250 --> 06:07:37,450
A researcher's repulsion machine could be connected to an outpost generator.

5886
06:07:38,770 --> 06:07:39,290
There you go.

5887
06:07:40,130 --> 06:07:41,550
A small object rolls out.

5888
06:07:44,370 --> 06:07:45,510
Activate the machine.

5889
06:07:45,630 --> 06:07:46,090
Wait, hold on.

5890
06:07:46,250 --> 06:07:46,890
Not right now.

5891
06:07:47,470 --> 06:07:48,010
Research!

5892
06:07:53,080 --> 06:07:55,200
Oh my gosh.

5893
06:08:00,680 --> 06:08:01,020
OK.

5894
06:08:01,640 --> 06:08:02,240
Activate.

5895
06:08:02,300 --> 06:08:02,600
Yes.

5896
06:08:02,600 --> 06:08:05,320
The repulsion machine hums in words to life.

5897
06:08:05,440 --> 06:08:09,020
A few seconds later, a bright light shoots from the top and an alarm begins blaring.

5898
06:08:09,560 --> 06:08:13,620
The researcher says this should keep the creature at bay for a time at least.

5899
06:08:15,940 --> 06:08:18,200
I mean, or attack is what she said.

5900
06:08:19,540 --> 06:08:20,500
Really depends.

5901
06:08:24,040 --> 06:08:25,000
Oh, he's gone.

5902
06:08:27,640 --> 06:08:28,600
This is it, right?

5903
06:08:29,740 --> 06:08:30,220
Wait.

5904
06:08:32,980 --> 06:08:37,800
I'll probably have to pay for more if I screw this up.

5905
06:08:40,300 --> 06:08:41,260
Is this it?

5906
06:08:41,700 --> 06:08:42,380
Which one's it?

5907
06:08:43,480 --> 06:08:44,660
What the hell are you?

5908
06:08:48,460 --> 06:08:49,580
Giant amphipod.

5909
06:08:50,700 --> 06:08:51,480
There it is.

5910
06:08:51,520 --> 06:08:51,800
There it is.

5911
06:08:51,800 --> 06:08:52,160
I see it.

5912
06:09:05,980 --> 06:09:06,940
We did it!

5913
06:09:10,480 --> 06:09:11,040
Ew.

5914
06:09:11,800 --> 06:09:12,840
It's so slimy.

5915
06:09:17,400 --> 06:09:18,140
Keep going.

5916
06:09:28,940 --> 06:09:30,760
Is this like a blobfish, you think?

5917
06:09:36,330 --> 06:09:37,970
It's kind of loud and annoying.

5918
06:09:38,950 --> 06:09:39,990
Wait a second, what's this?

5919
06:09:41,310 --> 06:09:42,530
Is it starting to stir again?

5920
06:09:44,590 --> 06:09:45,250
Oh, sorry.

5921
06:09:45,450 --> 06:09:45,970
That scared me.

5922
06:09:47,550 --> 06:09:49,330
I think he's coming too.

5923
06:09:49,990 --> 06:09:50,810
I think he's coming too.

5924
06:09:54,730 --> 06:09:56,750
I thought it was showing me that he's coming too.

5925
06:09:58,430 --> 06:09:59,150
Oh, this thing.

5926
06:10:00,010 --> 06:10:02,950
I took too many blobfish.

5927
06:10:04,030 --> 06:10:05,790
Wait, we can move this around.

5928
06:10:07,470 --> 06:10:07,990
Easy peasy.

5929
06:10:08,550 --> 06:10:09,010
Easy mode.

5930
06:10:09,970 --> 06:10:10,310
Nice.

5931
06:10:14,050 --> 06:10:14,990
This way.

5932
06:10:17,730 --> 06:10:18,450
Run?

5933
06:10:18,710 --> 06:10:19,490
I'm running.

5934
06:10:21,410 --> 06:10:22,770
We're getting out.

5935
06:10:26,310 --> 06:10:30,530
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5936
06:10:31,210 --> 06:10:32,730
Please leave me alone.

5937
06:10:33,490 --> 06:10:34,570
I hate the mist.

5938
06:10:34,690 --> 06:10:35,390
It's so annoying.

5939
06:10:43,840 --> 06:10:45,500
About those specimens.

5940
06:10:46,100 --> 06:10:47,540
I got two of them.

5941
06:10:48,380 --> 06:10:50,860
Why did I get so many of these guys?

5942
06:10:51,720 --> 06:10:53,860
And no other amphipods.

5943
06:10:53,860 --> 06:10:56,100
I have good news and bad news.

5944
06:10:56,180 --> 06:10:57,060
The bad news.

5945
06:10:57,380 --> 06:11:01,760
The bad news is that the samples you retrieved from the basin have dangerously high counts of cellular mutations.

5946
06:11:03,460 --> 06:11:03,880
Wait, what?

5947
06:11:04,780 --> 06:11:08,700
The good news is that I've honed in on what's causing the abnormalities in the ecosystem.

5948
06:11:10,260 --> 06:11:11,480
This all points to one thing.

5949
06:11:11,900 --> 06:11:15,360
That thing in the basin is harmful to the life at a cellular level.

5950
06:11:16,880 --> 06:11:20,240
It damages everything around it, whether passively or with intent.

5951
06:11:20,800 --> 06:11:22,420
I need to write up a report on my findings.

5952
06:11:22,420 --> 06:11:24,140
Sorry, our findings.

5953
06:11:24,620 --> 06:11:25,020
Immediately.

5954
06:11:25,920 --> 06:11:27,400
Maybe now they'll take me seriously.

5955
06:11:28,420 --> 06:11:29,080
How rude of me.

5956
06:11:29,140 --> 06:11:32,440
You've done all this for me and I've not got much to say thank you with.

5957
06:11:32,840 --> 06:11:33,720
You should have this.

5958
06:11:33,800 --> 06:11:35,100
Wait, what about the good news?

5959
06:11:36,160 --> 06:11:37,500
Plan for the future.

5960
06:11:39,980 --> 06:11:40,780
Thank you.

5961
06:11:47,840 --> 06:11:48,240
Sleep.

5962
06:11:49,200 --> 06:11:50,500
Oh no, the fish!

5963
06:11:53,480 --> 06:11:54,660
They're still fresh.

5964
06:11:55,080 --> 06:11:56,160
They're still fresh.

5965
06:12:00,170 --> 06:12:01,280
All I have to do is hurry.

5966
06:12:02,320 --> 06:12:03,480
Hurry back home.

5967
06:12:05,880 --> 06:12:06,900
Not home.

5968
06:12:07,260 --> 06:12:07,980
You know what I meant.

5969
06:12:11,660 --> 06:12:14,430
Make haste.

5970
06:12:19,670 --> 06:12:20,370
Boost.

5971
06:12:23,770 --> 06:12:24,910
They're still fresh.

5972
06:12:25,850 --> 06:12:26,530
Can

5973
06:12:30,970 --> 06:12:32,390
I grab this thing too?

5974
06:12:33,910 --> 06:12:34,590
A little crab.

5975
06:12:35,230 --> 06:12:35,630
Nice.

5976
06:12:38,990 --> 06:12:41,390
Oh, even turning around I got a new fish.

5977
06:12:43,510 --> 06:12:44,050
Okay.

5978
06:12:45,110 --> 06:12:46,350
How are they?

5979
06:12:46,590 --> 06:12:47,230
My fish?

5980
06:12:48,030 --> 06:12:48,630
They're stale.

5981
06:12:50,510 --> 06:12:54,110
They're stale, but still worth money.

5982
06:12:56,490 --> 06:12:58,550
Alright, let's undock.

5983
06:12:59,010 --> 06:12:59,930
Let's teleport.

5984
06:13:06,090 --> 06:13:08,530
I thought we got bamboozled for a second.

5985
06:13:08,770 --> 06:13:10,610
That it just blew up my entire ship.

5986
06:13:14,990 --> 06:13:19,810
You walk in and place the jewel-encrusted ring on a table by the collector.

5987
06:13:20,070 --> 06:13:20,830
His eyes widen.

5988
06:13:21,490 --> 06:13:23,390
We're certainly making excellent progress now.

5989
06:13:23,390 --> 06:13:25,330
And I know what you're thinking.

5990
06:13:25,970 --> 06:13:28,250
An item like this would fetch a fortune at any auction.

5991
06:13:28,650 --> 06:13:31,450
But for us, it's value transcends material wealth.

5992
06:13:33,530 --> 06:13:34,750
I mean it sort of did.

5993
06:13:34,910 --> 06:13:36,350
Yeah, but you know what I meant.

5994
06:13:38,430 --> 06:13:39,930
Regardless, you are due a reward.

5995
06:13:40,570 --> 06:13:42,250
Alright, he's going to speak.

5996
06:13:43,330 --> 06:13:43,730
Vanish.

5997
06:13:44,350 --> 06:13:45,670
You hear a growling.

5998
06:13:47,630 --> 06:13:48,630
Crackling in your ears.

5999
06:13:48,750 --> 06:13:51,370
Suddenly your vision flares and both of your ears pop.

6000
06:13:51,370 --> 06:13:52,930
He closes the book.

6001
06:13:58,180 --> 06:13:59,120
We must keep searching.

6002
06:13:59,640 --> 06:14:01,800
I've been thinking more on where we might find another.

6003
06:14:02,240 --> 06:14:09,360
I can imagine all manner of detritus swallowed by the silty muck of twisted strands channels.

6004
06:14:09,900 --> 06:14:10,820
It's worth investigating.

6005
06:14:11,960 --> 06:14:14,620
I'll mark a location on your map where you can begin your search.

6006
06:14:14,740 --> 06:14:15,780
Why am I going crazy?

6007
06:14:17,060 --> 06:14:18,240
Oh yeah, what did you do to me?

6008
06:14:18,360 --> 06:14:18,800
What is this?

6009
06:14:18,900 --> 06:14:19,120
Vanish.

6010
06:14:20,420 --> 06:14:22,400
Temporary protection from most things.

6011
06:14:22,520 --> 06:14:25,120
If spoken swiftly enough, they can be used defensively.

6012
06:14:27,180 --> 06:14:28,620
Choose their moment carefully.

6013
06:14:28,780 --> 06:14:31,280
The more they are spoken, the more they are understood.

6014
06:14:37,030 --> 06:14:38,490
Oh, teleporting does that.

6015
06:14:38,830 --> 06:14:44,430
What will you do once you have all the relics?

6016
06:14:44,950 --> 06:14:46,190
He ponders for a moment.

6017
06:14:47,110 --> 06:14:48,570
It's surprising, isn't it?

6018
06:14:48,890 --> 06:14:50,890
The attachments we hold towards simple objects.

6019
06:14:51,430 --> 06:14:52,830
But they are anything but simple.

6020
06:14:53,530 --> 06:14:56,650
Seemingly mute articles can speak in different ways.

6021
06:14:59,870 --> 06:15:04,470
If I showed you a childhood toy, you would be awash with forgotten memories.

6022
06:15:05,450 --> 06:15:08,330
They hold the power to recall what was once lost.

6023
06:15:08,890 --> 06:15:09,550
Anything else?

6024
06:15:10,530 --> 06:15:11,710
Nah, I'm going.

6025
06:15:13,150 --> 06:15:14,790
I just wanna make money.

6026
06:15:17,270 --> 06:15:21,750
I'm here to fish and... fish?

6027
06:15:24,190 --> 06:15:26,030
Oh, I don't have oceanic anymore.

6028
06:15:30,450 --> 06:15:31,330
Like Ratatouille?

6029
06:15:35,290 --> 06:15:36,530
Good morning, Mintao.

6030
06:15:36,570 --> 06:15:37,590
Woke up and you're still playing.

6031
06:15:38,670 --> 06:15:40,130
I haven't been playing for that long.

6032
06:15:40,950 --> 06:15:42,450
Did you get like 2 hours of sleep?

6033
06:15:47,190 --> 06:15:48,070
Thank you.

6034
06:15:48,270 --> 06:15:49,070
And storage.

6035
06:15:51,230 --> 06:15:53,050
So, can I sell these?

6036
06:15:53,230 --> 06:15:55,070
No, I can discard them, but...

6037
06:15:56,750 --> 06:15:57,610
Okay, thank you.

6038
06:15:57,830 --> 06:15:58,550
Bye bye.

6039
06:15:59,650 --> 06:16:00,730
It's been 6 hours.

6040
06:16:00,850 --> 06:16:02,830
That's not enough time to sleep, though.

6041
06:16:04,350 --> 06:16:06,130
Matthew, thank you so much for the 10k.

6042
06:16:06,190 --> 06:16:07,150
Thank you.

6043
06:16:17,120 --> 06:16:21,180
Oh, a lighthouse keeper approaches you on the dock wearing a questioning expression.

6044
06:16:21,680 --> 06:16:24,860
You must have been around most of the islands by now.

6045
06:16:25,360 --> 06:16:27,120
Have you found whatever it is you're looking for?

6046
06:16:28,020 --> 06:16:29,440
I'm just fishing.

6047
06:16:30,100 --> 06:16:32,520
She recoils from your flagrant lie.

6048
06:16:33,340 --> 06:16:34,560
Why do you mistrust me so?

6049
06:16:35,000 --> 06:16:37,520
What have I done to warrant such suspicion?

6050
06:16:38,320 --> 06:16:40,260
She turns from you, shaking her head and muttering.

6051
06:16:40,780 --> 06:16:42,940
She heads back towards the light... I mean, it's true, though.

6052
06:16:44,740 --> 06:16:46,620
I am just... I am!

6053
06:16:51,360 --> 06:16:52,320
Fathomless whinge.

6054
06:16:53,120 --> 06:17:00,150
I guess I could sell this.

6055
06:17:07,920 --> 06:17:08,880
Whistle.

6056
06:17:09,600 --> 06:17:10,320
Oceanic.

6057
06:17:12,300 --> 06:17:12,540
Yeah.

6058
06:17:15,960 --> 06:17:17,700
I'll unsell.

6059
06:17:18,920 --> 06:17:19,880
Daniel.

6060
06:17:21,020 --> 06:17:21,800
In.

6061
06:17:22,840 --> 06:17:23,320
Daniel.

6062
06:17:23,980 --> 06:17:24,460
Purchase.

6063
06:17:26,720 --> 06:17:28,380
I have to get up for work in 4 and a half hours.

6064
06:17:28,380 --> 06:17:29,760
Please go to sleep.

6065
06:17:30,320 --> 06:17:31,620
Please, please, please.

6066
06:17:31,880 --> 06:17:32,660
Please go to sleep.

6067
06:17:34,480 --> 06:17:36,160
And we'll repair everything.

6068
06:17:38,480 --> 06:17:39,820
Shiny, bright and new.

6069
06:17:40,640 --> 06:17:41,100
Awesome.

6070
06:17:42,020 --> 06:17:43,400
I'm just here for the fish, ma'am.

6071
06:17:44,260 --> 06:17:45,000
It's true.

6072
06:17:45,120 --> 06:17:46,380
I'm just here for the fish.

6073
06:17:53,220 --> 06:17:53,680
Nice.

6074
06:17:54,660 --> 06:17:56,020
Is she doing the good ending route?

6075
06:17:56,140 --> 06:17:57,620
I don't know what I'm doing at all.

6076
06:17:57,620 --> 06:17:58,760
I'm playing the game.

6077
06:18:00,640 --> 06:18:02,340
I'm just playing the game.

6078
06:18:03,640 --> 06:18:05,520
We have so much scrap.

6079
06:18:08,340 --> 06:18:11,500
I'm not intending for any sort of ending, though.

6080
06:18:11,560 --> 06:18:14,160
I'm just going along with it.

6081
06:18:22,660 --> 06:18:25,700
I guess we can get... We can sell this hydraulic rod, huh?

6082
06:18:31,120 --> 06:18:32,640
Yeah, we don't need that.

6083
06:18:46,200 --> 06:18:47,400
That's much cleaner.

6084
06:18:47,920 --> 06:18:50,700
I want the rest of the treasure map.

6085
06:18:54,980 --> 06:18:56,680
The other things, like these?

6086
06:18:57,920 --> 06:18:59,700
I guess I can.

6087
06:19:00,720 --> 06:19:03,660
Like the weak valve engine.

6088
06:19:05,600 --> 06:19:06,940
I guess I can sell it.

6089
06:19:15,480 --> 06:19:16,400
There we go.

6090
06:19:16,780 --> 06:19:17,820
Wow, it's so tidy.

6091
06:19:19,000 --> 06:19:21,360
Relics, cults, ancient horrors beyond my comprehension?

6092
06:19:21,620 --> 06:19:26,220
Man, I don't know nothing about that, but check out this funny 12-tailed fish I just got.

6093
06:19:27,160 --> 06:19:30,040
It's literally how I'm feeling about this entire game.

6094
06:19:33,420 --> 06:19:38,440
Out of the watch on a ship to watch mint on a ship.

6095
06:19:41,320 --> 06:19:41,800
Cheerios!

6096
06:19:42,040 --> 06:19:43,500
Welcome to membership, thank you!

6097
06:19:45,240 --> 06:19:45,680
Alrighty.

6098
06:19:46,080 --> 06:19:51,760
Actually, the one place he's telling us to go to next, we have not been to before, so that's exciting.

6099
06:19:53,080 --> 06:19:55,020
Oh, I've been finding relics for the collector.

6100
06:19:55,840 --> 06:19:56,680
Relics collector?

6101
06:19:56,940 --> 06:19:59,460
I'm not sure what you're hoping to achieve with this character.

6102
06:20:00,120 --> 06:20:00,720
Do I even know?

6103
06:20:01,240 --> 06:20:02,260
Have you stopped to consider it?

6104
06:20:04,160 --> 06:20:04,600
Fish.

6105
06:20:06,580 --> 06:20:07,340
Funny fish.

6106
06:20:07,340 --> 06:20:07,400
Fish.

6107
06:20:09,980 --> 06:20:12,880
Something about horrors beyond my comprehension?

6108
06:20:16,360 --> 06:20:18,400
This one might have three eyes.

6109
06:20:23,750 --> 06:20:24,310
Oh!

6110
06:20:24,730 --> 06:20:26,050
It has five eyes!

6111
06:20:28,170 --> 06:20:31,950
Wait a second though, what were we supposed to find for that one guy?

6112
06:20:32,430 --> 06:20:34,110
Uh-oh, he's probably starving over there.

6113
06:20:34,630 --> 06:20:35,790
A fangtooth.

6114
06:20:38,330 --> 06:20:38,810
Fangtooth.

6115
06:21:05,130 --> 06:21:06,150
Never heard of her.

6116
06:21:09,350 --> 06:21:10,370
Never heard of her.

6117
06:21:18,720 --> 06:21:19,200
Vanish.

6118
06:21:25,180 --> 06:21:26,600
It's an abyssal fish.

6119
06:21:26,840 --> 06:21:27,940
Oh, I see, I see.

6120
06:21:28,340 --> 06:21:28,840
What was I doing?

6121
06:21:29,120 --> 06:21:32,060
Oh, I was gonna go sell these guys real quick.

6122
06:21:32,640 --> 06:21:35,220
And then maybe I'll go find some abyssal fish.

6123
06:21:38,320 --> 06:21:38,740
Hello!

6124
06:21:39,800 --> 06:21:43,320
In fact, I am gonna buy another crab pot.

6125
06:21:50,040 --> 06:21:53,060
Where can we find some abyssal fish that I haven't gotten before?

6126
06:21:53,980 --> 06:21:55,140
Or, you know what I mean.

6127
06:22:00,600 --> 06:22:02,880
I'm gonna put it here.

6128
06:22:13,610 --> 06:22:15,070
Scare away spooky fish?

6129
06:22:15,170 --> 06:22:16,010
There are none.

6130
06:22:17,150 --> 06:22:18,770
Every fish loves me.

6131
06:22:19,970 --> 06:22:21,510
I can't see in the dark.

6132
06:22:21,710 --> 06:22:23,310
Okay, I'm gonna go turn the lights on.

6133
06:22:26,590 --> 06:22:29,730
I can't see where the deep fish will be at.

6134
06:22:32,830 --> 06:22:34,530
Did you just call me monkey?

6135
06:22:34,530 --> 06:22:34,530
Monkey?

6136
06:22:38,090 --> 06:22:40,970
It's not monkey, it's Minky!

6137
06:22:50,690 --> 06:22:52,850
It's not my name.

6138
06:22:58,980 --> 06:23:00,880
Let's go find some abyssal fish.

6139
06:23:10,180 --> 06:23:11,220
Are you?

6140
06:23:16,940 --> 06:23:17,700
Coastal?

6141
06:23:18,460 --> 06:23:18,980
Where?

6142
06:23:19,380 --> 06:23:20,680
We're in like the middle of the ocean.

6143
06:23:22,580 --> 06:23:24,060
Return to monkey.

6144
06:23:24,320 --> 06:23:25,340
Same thing!

6145
06:23:26,080 --> 06:23:30,660
Hi monkey!

6146
06:23:37,040 --> 06:23:39,020
Look at that!

6147
06:23:39,220 --> 06:23:40,880
Look how much more room we have!

6148
06:23:41,620 --> 06:23:42,380
Amazing!

6149
06:23:52,270 --> 06:23:53,690
A loose jaw.

6150
06:23:54,510 --> 06:23:56,130
I've gotten that guy though.

6151
06:23:56,570 --> 06:23:57,450
What is that?

6152
06:23:57,650 --> 06:23:58,750
Bronze whaler.

6153
06:24:01,410 --> 06:24:03,730
Looking for a new and exciting fish.

6154
06:24:04,310 --> 06:24:05,370
Yeah, hot dog.

6155
06:24:06,350 --> 06:24:07,710
Little mackerel.

6156
06:24:08,490 --> 06:24:10,330
Wait, another sailfish.

6157
06:24:12,450 --> 06:24:14,090
Thanks for keeping me company while I work today.

6158
06:24:16,430 --> 06:24:17,110
What?

6159
06:24:17,750 --> 06:24:18,990
That's not my name!

6160
06:24:19,950 --> 06:24:22,350
That's not my name!

6161
06:24:25,230 --> 06:24:32,330
My name is Mint Phantom, but you can also call me Minto or Minky.

6162
06:24:39,060 --> 06:24:42,240
And if you call me anything else...

6163
06:24:44,320 --> 06:24:46,240
You owe me...

6164
06:24:47,400 --> 06:24:48,000
Much.

6165
06:24:50,200 --> 06:24:51,280
Mint Toad.

6166
06:24:52,980 --> 06:24:55,020
I choose you, Minky.

6167
06:25:01,260 --> 06:25:02,460
I'm not a Minky.

6168
06:25:07,320 --> 06:25:08,880
What about Little Lady?

6169
06:25:10,380 --> 06:25:12,000
Minto, what if we called you Q?

6170
06:25:13,400 --> 06:25:15,080
I made chat...

6171
06:25:17,920 --> 06:25:20,080
I thought I had haste.

6172
06:25:23,520 --> 06:25:25,040
I'm so glad.

6173
06:25:26,220 --> 06:25:26,820
Minto.

6174
06:25:35,350 --> 06:25:37,250
A bearded mackerel.

6175
06:25:39,530 --> 06:25:40,450
Getting better.

6176
06:25:40,590 --> 06:25:41,650
Look at the cyclone.

6177
06:25:42,310 --> 06:25:42,910
For real.

6178
06:25:43,810 --> 06:25:45,770
Now you might be wondering, why are you back here, Minto?

6179
06:25:46,510 --> 06:25:48,110
Because there might be abyssal fish.

6180
06:25:48,290 --> 06:25:49,070
I don't know.

6181
06:25:49,370 --> 06:25:50,430
I'm just here.

6182
06:25:50,910 --> 06:25:51,670
Almost $400.

6183
06:25:53,530 --> 06:25:54,810
Sailfish are insane.

6184
06:25:54,810 --> 06:25:59,910
Where do you want to go for lunch, Nerdo?

6185
06:26:00,530 --> 06:26:01,870
This is Minko.

6186
06:26:02,410 --> 06:26:03,510
That's so funny!

6187
06:26:05,250 --> 06:26:07,650
Guys, I'm going to give you identity crisis.

6188
06:26:18,300 --> 06:26:18,980
Dolphin.

6189
06:26:24,790 --> 06:26:25,890
What's that?

6190
06:26:26,530 --> 06:26:27,210
Perch.

6191
06:26:27,330 --> 06:26:27,830
Tiger.

6192
06:26:30,390 --> 06:26:31,430
Abyssal fish.

6193
06:26:31,510 --> 06:26:33,530
Ok, let's go back to our little friend.

6194
06:26:33,530 --> 06:26:35,190
The guy that's hungry.

6195
06:26:37,270 --> 06:26:42,130
And maybe... Maybe it's an abyssal thing close to him.

6196
06:26:43,630 --> 06:26:44,130
Maybe?

6197
06:26:44,430 --> 06:26:45,410
I don't know anymore.

6198
06:26:47,870 --> 06:26:48,810
What are you?

6199
06:26:49,510 --> 06:26:50,270
What are you?

6200
06:26:50,410 --> 06:26:50,650
What are you?

6201
06:26:50,730 --> 06:26:51,090
What are you?

6202
06:26:51,290 --> 06:26:54,310
What are you?

6203
06:26:57,490 --> 06:26:59,270
Oceanic fish that I have not caught.

6204
06:27:00,610 --> 06:27:02,370
Wait, I do want to put that on.

6205
06:27:09,320 --> 06:27:09,800
Sturgeon.

6206
06:27:16,880 --> 06:27:18,020
That's kind of awkward.

6207
06:27:20,200 --> 06:27:20,680
Nashi!

6208
06:27:21,100 --> 06:27:22,260
Thanks for the five gifted!

6209
06:27:23,000 --> 06:27:24,060
Oh, there's no fish.

6210
06:27:24,500 --> 06:27:24,920
I have to play that.

6211
06:27:24,980 --> 06:27:27,220
In Minto's world, bullies give her money.

6212
06:27:28,860 --> 06:27:31,640
It is illegal to assert that your name is not Freak Phantom.

6213
06:27:32,900 --> 06:27:35,340
Ok, but that's like...

6214
06:27:35,340 --> 06:27:38,300
We gotta be really good buddies for you to call me that.

6215
06:27:42,990 --> 06:27:45,590
One does not just call someone a freak.

6216
06:27:47,630 --> 06:27:52,150
Without it being an act of love.

6217
06:27:54,950 --> 06:27:56,650
Oh, there's wood over there.

6218
06:27:59,980 --> 06:28:00,940
Getting dark.

6219
06:28:01,080 --> 06:28:03,140
I know, I know, I know.

6220
06:28:10,360 --> 06:28:12,320
Where's all the abyssal fishies at?

6221
06:28:15,840 --> 06:28:17,420
The Minky Momo!

6222
06:28:17,940 --> 06:28:18,460
No!

6223
06:28:29,000 --> 06:28:29,680
Rest.

6224
06:28:31,520 --> 06:28:32,740
Might be a night fish.

6225
06:28:33,520 --> 06:28:33,940
Maybe.

6226
06:28:34,260 --> 06:28:35,420
And here I am waking up.

6227
06:28:39,000 --> 06:28:39,480
Let's see.

6228
06:28:45,440 --> 06:28:47,540
You call us freaks all the time.

6229
06:28:48,300 --> 06:28:51,700
You said what I said.

6230
06:29:09,300 --> 06:29:10,440
What's this?

6231
06:29:17,200 --> 06:29:20,400
Our little friend is in that little cove over there.

6232
06:29:21,020 --> 06:29:21,600
So let's see.

6233
06:29:24,620 --> 06:29:25,460
Research!

6234
06:29:26,960 --> 06:29:29,380
And whatever that thing is!

6235
06:29:31,560 --> 06:29:32,860
Research first!

6236
06:29:33,780 --> 06:29:37,560
Is this the research?

6237
06:29:40,400 --> 06:29:41,160
Yes!

6238
06:29:48,320 --> 06:29:49,080
Yay!

6239
06:29:51,120 --> 06:29:52,740
New fish located.

6240
06:29:52,940 --> 06:29:53,640
Yeah, where was he?

6241
06:29:54,300 --> 06:29:55,340
Right there.

6242
06:29:59,870 --> 06:30:00,330
Forward!

6243
06:30:01,530 --> 06:30:02,050
Straight!

6244
06:30:04,450 --> 06:30:05,310
That guy right there.

6245
06:30:05,490 --> 06:30:06,150
Wait, what are you?

6246
06:30:06,510 --> 06:30:08,450
Oh, you!

6247
06:30:08,450 --> 06:30:11,430
Oh, there's so many new fish.

6248
06:30:11,730 --> 06:30:12,250
New fish!

6249
06:30:12,650 --> 06:30:13,070
New fish!

6250
06:30:16,430 --> 06:30:16,950
Exciting!

6251
06:30:17,230 --> 06:30:18,370
This is exciting everybody.

6252
06:30:27,300 --> 06:30:28,340
It's me!

6253
06:30:35,070 --> 06:30:35,990
It's me!

6254
06:30:37,310 --> 06:30:38,110
It's a me!

6255
06:30:38,470 --> 06:30:38,990
Mito!

6256
06:30:40,830 --> 06:30:42,750
I think this thing is definitely the tiger.

6257
06:30:42,950 --> 06:30:43,050
No!

6258
06:30:43,290 --> 06:30:43,750
Oh my gosh!

6259
06:30:43,770 --> 06:30:45,010
It's a bear alive!

6260
06:30:45,010 --> 06:30:45,670
Okay,

6261
06:30:50,640 --> 06:30:52,000
I gotta be careful of the time.

6262
06:30:53,400 --> 06:30:56,980
Because I do not know where... Oh wait, is that a dock right there?

6263
06:31:01,400 --> 06:31:03,340
Is that a workable dock?

6264
06:31:07,400 --> 06:31:08,900
Some more dredge.

6265
06:31:14,620 --> 06:31:16,800
Some more dredge.

6266
06:31:16,800 --> 06:31:18,600
Some more dredge for my boss Mito.

6267
06:31:20,940 --> 06:31:22,840
Thank you.

6268
06:31:27,780 --> 06:31:28,260
Where

6269
06:31:39,130 --> 06:31:41,270
is your fish mister?

6270
06:31:42,630 --> 06:31:44,430
Is it maybe really a night fish?

6271
06:31:45,350 --> 06:31:46,450
It could be.

6272
06:31:49,730 --> 06:31:51,950
It could be a night fish.

6273
06:31:53,530 --> 06:31:55,230
Let's dredge here.

6274
06:32:09,330 --> 06:32:11,170
Sapphire earrings.

6275
06:32:12,250 --> 06:32:13,150
Oh it's dark.

6276
06:32:13,850 --> 06:32:14,990
Oh it's dark.

6277
06:32:16,210 --> 06:32:22,850
I will fish by...

6278
06:32:24,470 --> 06:32:26,250
Wait, where am I going?

6279
06:32:27,690 --> 06:32:28,910
Wrong way.

6280
06:32:30,370 --> 06:32:31,610
This way.

6281
06:32:32,710 --> 06:32:34,190
And also this thing.

6282
06:32:36,090 --> 06:32:39,570
Molly Phantom from the Four Kids Dog.

6283
06:32:40,030 --> 06:32:41,030
What is that from?

6284
06:32:42,610 --> 06:32:43,870
Who is she actually?

6285
06:32:46,370 --> 06:32:48,390
I'm looking for any disturb...

6286
06:32:48,990 --> 06:32:50,530
What is this?

6287
06:32:55,020 --> 06:32:56,240
I'm drifting?

6288
06:32:59,220 --> 06:33:04,480
Where is all my... Where is all my super cool...

6289
06:33:07,600 --> 06:33:09,020
Abyssal fish at?

6290
06:33:09,920 --> 06:33:10,880
Are you coming close?

6291
06:33:13,180 --> 06:33:14,200
I can't tell.

6292
06:33:16,120 --> 06:33:17,440
But I want this thing.

6293
06:33:20,650 --> 06:33:21,610
I don't care.

6294
06:33:22,270 --> 06:33:22,990
I want it!

6295
06:33:24,610 --> 06:33:25,570
What are you?

6296
06:33:26,190 --> 06:33:27,270
Oh, nevermind.

6297
06:33:27,670 --> 06:33:28,470
I think I have you.

6298
06:33:29,330 --> 06:33:31,170
No, I don't have you.

6299
06:33:33,650 --> 06:33:34,650
Scouring bash.

6300
06:33:40,630 --> 06:33:44,730
I feel more fine without the stinking mist around.

6301
06:33:45,110 --> 06:33:45,470
Look at them.

6302
06:33:45,510 --> 06:33:46,270
There is two of them.

6303
06:33:48,370 --> 06:33:51,330
I can't tell if they move when I move or if they...

6304
06:33:52,470 --> 06:33:53,010
You know?

6305
06:33:55,070 --> 06:33:56,990
Oh, they definitely look like they are getting closer.

6306
06:34:04,810 --> 06:34:05,650
Fish market.

6307
06:34:10,050 --> 06:34:10,490
185.

6308
06:34:13,630 --> 06:34:17,850
It did say that I could dispel, but does it work on... I don't know what it works.

6309
06:34:18,190 --> 06:34:20,710
Does it work on... It said it doesn't work on everything.

6310
06:34:27,930 --> 06:34:28,790
They chase you.

6311
06:34:35,580 --> 06:34:37,340
Let's head back over to that area.

6312
06:34:37,480 --> 06:34:39,100
Maybe we can get some abyssal fish.

6313
06:34:46,260 --> 06:34:47,220
Excuse me.

6314
06:34:49,480 --> 06:34:50,120
What's that?

6315
06:34:50,380 --> 06:34:50,980
I don't like that.

6316
06:34:51,300 --> 06:34:51,820
What is that?

6317
06:34:52,020 --> 06:34:52,720
What does that mean?

6318
06:34:54,640 --> 06:34:55,880
What does that mean?

6319
06:34:56,260 --> 06:34:57,380
What do the eyeballs mean?

6320
06:35:11,010 --> 06:35:11,970
I see.

6321
06:35:14,070 --> 06:35:15,930
Oh, I didn't do the fish.

6322
06:35:16,330 --> 06:35:16,750
You are right.

6323
06:35:16,890 --> 06:35:17,870
I didn't do the fish.

6324
06:35:19,250 --> 06:35:20,290
In the...

6325
06:35:21,590 --> 06:35:23,930
Behind the waterfall.

6326
06:35:24,590 --> 06:35:26,030
Yes, thank you for reminding me.

6327
06:35:28,650 --> 06:35:30,190
I did not get that guy.

6328
06:35:35,420 --> 06:35:37,240
Indiana Jones ass music.

6329
06:35:40,460 --> 06:35:41,340
Wait, this way?

6330
06:35:46,240 --> 06:35:48,560
And I won't crash into it either.

6331
06:35:49,160 --> 06:35:49,820
What's this?

6332
06:35:52,500 --> 06:35:54,000
Wait, it might be a new one though.

6333
06:35:54,120 --> 06:35:54,620
New variant?

6334
06:35:57,940 --> 06:35:59,100
Boring to kid.

6335
06:36:08,640 --> 06:36:09,800
I missed it.

6336
06:36:09,840 --> 06:36:10,780
It was so tiny.

6337
06:36:10,780 --> 06:36:10,820
Sorry.

6338
06:36:16,460 --> 06:36:19,100
Four fish acquired.

6339
06:36:22,360 --> 06:36:24,260
So close.

6340
06:36:25,000 --> 06:36:26,420
So close.

6341
06:36:31,530 --> 06:36:33,230
My fancy fishing.

6342
06:36:34,590 --> 06:36:37,570
Can I get this thing here now?

6343
06:36:38,030 --> 06:36:39,170
Is this guy like patrolling?

6344
06:36:39,350 --> 06:36:40,450
I don't ever know how...

6345
06:36:40,450 --> 06:36:41,350
When he comes out.

6346
06:36:41,570 --> 06:36:42,390
Why he comes out.

6347
06:36:42,730 --> 06:36:43,670
When he comes out.

6348
06:36:43,990 --> 06:36:45,590
For whom he comes out.

6349
06:36:50,440 --> 06:36:52,520
Like I know when I pass by that area.

6350
06:36:52,640 --> 06:36:53,920
One single doubloon.

6351
06:36:57,220 --> 06:36:59,040
I wonder if my thing works on him.

6352
06:36:59,660 --> 06:37:00,320
My banish.

6353
06:37:03,460 --> 06:37:04,960
He has a patrol route.

6354
06:37:06,700 --> 06:37:08,040
What is this?

6355
06:37:08,640 --> 06:37:09,280
More scrap?

6356
06:37:09,480 --> 06:37:09,700
Yeah.

6357
06:37:15,260 --> 06:37:16,620
I did notice that.

6358
06:37:17,140 --> 06:37:19,380
Oh my gosh.

6359
06:37:20,140 --> 06:37:23,160
We are going to be able to do all the research ever in the world.

6360
06:37:25,280 --> 06:37:26,340
Holy cow.

6361
06:37:33,220 --> 06:37:34,360
Is this normal?

6362
06:37:35,220 --> 06:37:37,720
I got

6363
06:37:41,290 --> 06:37:42,950
to maneuver some stuff around a bit.

6364
06:37:44,830 --> 06:37:45,390
There we go.

6365
06:37:55,050 --> 06:37:55,690
Oh.

6366
06:37:56,630 --> 06:37:57,250
Night time.

6367
06:38:01,660 --> 06:38:03,220
I don't think I can fit anymore though.

6368
06:38:25,100 --> 06:38:26,660
Did it work?

6369
06:38:27,340 --> 06:38:28,180
Oh, it's gone.

6370
06:38:30,120 --> 06:38:31,500
OK, you can stop now.

6371
06:38:55,310 --> 06:38:55,830
Oh.

6372
06:38:58,670 --> 06:39:00,190
That was something.

6373
06:39:01,590 --> 06:39:04,050
And then, don't sell the fish.

6374
06:39:04,250 --> 06:39:06,690
Yes, we are not going to sell... How much did he go for?

6375
06:39:07,490 --> 06:39:08,290
I'm just curious.

6376
06:39:11,570 --> 06:39:12,090
300.

6377
06:39:12,950 --> 06:39:13,230
Almost.

6378
06:39:13,230 --> 06:39:13,430
Almost.

6379
06:39:24,050 --> 06:39:30,710
And as part of our thing, catch rare fish.

6380
06:39:33,410 --> 06:39:34,570
Report ore fish.

6381
06:39:34,970 --> 06:39:36,290
Oh, I just have to tell her.

6382
06:39:37,850 --> 06:39:38,470
Hello!

6383
06:39:40,470 --> 06:39:42,470
I found an ore fish.

6384
06:39:42,470 --> 06:39:43,490
That's great news.

6385
06:39:44,270 --> 06:39:45,030
Add it to my records.

6386
06:39:45,110 --> 06:39:45,770
Here, take this.

6387
06:39:47,510 --> 06:39:49,370
I can sell it.

6388
06:39:50,250 --> 06:39:51,910
I can sell it.

6389
06:39:53,570 --> 06:39:54,170
Nevermind.

6390
06:39:56,290 --> 06:39:57,110
Here you go, ma'am.

6391
06:40:04,960 --> 06:40:06,440
What should we research now?

6392
06:40:06,740 --> 06:40:07,580
We have four.

6393
06:40:09,400 --> 06:40:11,280
Guys, we have four research parts.

6394
06:40:20,240 --> 06:40:23,120
We could do engines or...

6395
06:40:24,540 --> 06:40:25,920
We could do nets.

6396
06:40:26,780 --> 06:40:27,180
Oh yeah!

6397
06:40:27,680 --> 06:40:28,680
The heavy duty net.

6398
06:40:28,920 --> 06:40:30,080
Yes, yes, yes, you're so right.

6399
06:40:30,160 --> 06:40:31,300
Thank you for reminding me.

6400
06:40:35,160 --> 06:40:36,360
I'm so excited.

6401
06:40:36,940 --> 06:40:37,900
I'm so excited.

6402
06:40:50,120 --> 06:40:51,080
Heavy duty.

6403
06:40:51,080 --> 06:40:53,900
I should repair this one first.

6404
06:40:56,440 --> 06:40:58,160
I sold everything in it.

6405
06:41:00,820 --> 06:41:01,420
680.

6406
06:41:01,680 --> 06:41:02,380
We can afford.

6407
06:41:14,720 --> 06:41:17,940
We're gonna be making big ol' bucks, everybody!

6408
06:41:18,540 --> 06:41:19,760
We're gonna be rich!

6409
06:41:20,240 --> 06:41:21,200
Rich, rich, rich!

6410
06:41:21,200 --> 06:41:22,220
Oh my gosh.

6411
06:41:26,020 --> 06:41:29,160
We've got all the best... What's these ones?

6412
06:41:29,700 --> 06:41:32,220
Oh, mangrove and then volcanic.

6413
06:41:33,300 --> 06:41:34,380
I see, I see, I see.

6414
06:41:36,080 --> 06:41:37,660
I see, I see, I see, I see.

6415
06:41:41,920 --> 06:41:44,560
Should I even try for... Well, I guess I can't.

6416
06:41:44,600 --> 06:41:48,080
I have to do these other engines first.

6417
06:41:55,450 --> 06:41:56,750
This one looks insane.

6418
06:41:56,870 --> 06:41:58,130
I want to try it so bad.

6419
06:42:00,430 --> 06:42:01,990
Get the rods first.

6420
06:42:04,370 --> 06:42:05,850
Yeah, you're right.

6421
06:42:06,790 --> 06:42:07,770
Back to rod.

6422
06:42:08,530 --> 06:42:10,470
Why do I keep rushing escape?

6423
06:42:11,290 --> 06:42:12,750
What else we got in here?

6424
06:42:13,750 --> 06:42:14,350
Encyclopedia.

6425
06:42:15,750 --> 06:42:17,390
Our special guy, the oarfish.

6426
06:42:19,570 --> 06:42:21,310
He doesn't have any aberrations.

6427
06:42:21,550 --> 06:42:22,130
He's special.

6428
06:42:24,390 --> 06:42:25,510
I'm sorry, $250.

6429
06:42:26,350 --> 06:42:27,870
Mine was like $249.

6430
06:42:34,790 --> 06:42:36,130
I got robbed.

6431
06:42:39,430 --> 06:42:41,130
Got robbed out of a dollar.

6432
06:42:47,890 --> 06:42:49,210
Not the crab pot.

6433
06:42:50,390 --> 06:42:51,030
Deploy!

6434
06:42:51,630 --> 06:42:52,310
My net.

6435
06:42:55,610 --> 06:42:57,930
Yeah, I got robbed of my single dollar.

6436
06:43:01,150 --> 06:43:03,670
I guess let's go to the...

6437
06:43:04,390 --> 06:43:05,650
Next place then.

6438
06:43:11,300 --> 06:43:13,220
To the twisted strand.

6439
06:43:15,500 --> 06:43:17,180
Ooh, scarlet prawn.

6440
06:43:18,460 --> 06:43:19,020
Yeah, this way.

6441
06:43:21,880 --> 06:43:23,140
Scammed a whole dollar.

6442
06:43:26,260 --> 06:43:27,420
Yeah, yeah.

6443
06:43:28,060 --> 06:43:28,900
I said what I said.

6444
06:43:33,840 --> 06:43:36,320
Oh my gosh, that scared the heck out of me.

6445
06:43:39,000 --> 06:43:39,840
Hello whale.

6446
06:43:43,040 --> 06:43:44,680
What if this is the thing that we need?

6447
06:43:44,980 --> 06:43:45,440
Tiger!

6448
06:43:46,580 --> 06:43:47,040
Viperfish.

6449
06:43:47,100 --> 06:43:48,200
I've also been called that.

6450
06:44:02,180 --> 06:44:06,600
How do I find the stinking tigerfish?

6451
06:44:06,720 --> 06:44:09,380
Can I get a hint if anybody looks it up?

6452
06:44:10,120 --> 06:44:11,920
If anybody googles it, give me a hint.

6453
06:44:14,280 --> 06:44:14,740
Barely.

6454
06:44:20,350 --> 06:44:20,810
Viperfish.

6455
06:44:26,910 --> 06:44:28,010
Under the sea.

6456
06:44:28,510 --> 06:44:29,310
Stellar basin?

6457
06:44:31,570 --> 06:44:32,030
Really?

6458
06:44:32,310 --> 06:44:33,130
We have to go back there?

6459
06:44:40,470 --> 06:44:41,710
It's in the water.

6460
06:44:42,270 --> 06:44:43,330
What am I going over here for?

6461
06:44:43,910 --> 06:44:46,030
Oh, I was just gonna go sell some stuff real quick.

6462
06:44:52,990 --> 06:44:54,150
Check my crab...

6463
06:44:59,770 --> 06:45:00,690
Crab legs.

6464
06:45:16,000 --> 06:45:16,600
Okay.

6465
06:45:20,620 --> 06:45:22,120
Hot dog indeed.

6466
06:45:22,520 --> 06:45:23,640
Let's go sell all this crab.

6467
06:45:24,180 --> 06:45:25,940
Man, these people are eating good!

6468
06:45:28,620 --> 06:45:32,680
Why does the twisted strand make me think of Outer Wilds?

6469
06:45:35,600 --> 06:45:36,800
I understand.

6470
06:45:38,420 --> 06:45:40,040
It makes me think of Twisted Pear.

6471
06:45:41,180 --> 06:45:42,060
Which is Neil Breen.

6472
06:45:43,580 --> 06:45:45,540
Sell all fish.

6473
06:45:45,760 --> 06:45:46,100
Alright.

6474
06:45:47,260 --> 06:45:47,900
Thank you, sir.

6475
06:45:48,040 --> 06:45:48,760
Thank you, sir.

6476
06:45:53,220 --> 06:45:54,920
Dark bramble vibes.

6477
06:45:55,080 --> 06:45:55,820
Truly, yeah.

6478
06:46:02,040 --> 06:46:04,960
So if I need to go back to...

6479
06:46:09,680 --> 06:46:11,360
The stellar basin.

6480
06:46:14,000 --> 06:46:14,640
Anchovy!

6481
06:46:18,440 --> 06:46:19,480
Little anchovy.

6482
06:46:37,980 --> 06:46:41,340
And I mean, there are anglerfish in here.

6483
06:46:41,880 --> 06:46:43,020
That's very bramble.

6484
06:46:44,380 --> 06:46:45,980
Oh, let's see what we got.

6485
06:46:47,200 --> 06:46:47,760
Oh, whoops.

6486
06:46:47,940 --> 06:46:48,200
My bad.

6487
06:46:48,500 --> 06:46:48,680
Tab.

6488
06:46:52,260 --> 06:46:53,020
What was it?

6489
06:46:53,040 --> 06:46:53,500
The future?

6490
06:46:54,880 --> 06:46:54,980
Oh.

6491
06:46:55,240 --> 06:46:59,060
15% chance to not reduce fish stocks when catching a fish with a rod.

6492
06:46:59,740 --> 06:47:00,500
I see.

6493
06:47:03,620 --> 06:47:05,920
It's so quiet here.

6494
06:47:10,140 --> 06:47:11,880
Anchovy king!

6495
06:47:12,420 --> 06:47:13,480
Holy moly.

6496
06:47:16,260 --> 06:47:16,720
Trophy!

6497
06:47:18,240 --> 06:47:19,900
What are these guys?

6498
06:47:22,940 --> 06:47:24,160
Oh, it's these guys.

6499
06:47:24,360 --> 06:47:24,460
Okay.

6500
06:47:28,480 --> 06:47:30,720
Maybe here?

6501
06:47:31,480 --> 06:47:34,440
These look like anglerfish though.

6502
06:47:43,730 --> 06:47:45,530
Music here is so spooky.

6503
06:47:49,170 --> 06:47:50,150
What are you?

6504
06:47:50,450 --> 06:47:51,250
More anglerfish?

6505
06:47:53,630 --> 06:47:55,930
What does it even look like?

6506
06:47:56,550 --> 06:47:57,650
I should probably... Hold on.

6507
06:47:57,790 --> 06:47:59,230
Let's check the...

6508
06:48:01,410 --> 06:48:04,030
Let's check the pursuit.

6509
06:48:04,870 --> 06:48:06,370
Oh, it doesn't show me a picture.

6510
06:48:07,110 --> 06:48:07,670
No!

6511
06:48:19,130 --> 06:48:20,630
Don't get angry, please.

6512
06:48:21,530 --> 06:48:22,750
Don't get angry, please.

6513
06:48:25,050 --> 06:48:27,430
I'm just a weasel.

6514
06:48:28,610 --> 06:48:30,430
I'm just a measly little fisherman.

6515
06:48:30,970 --> 06:48:32,010
Oh wait, I'm on the wrong side.

6516
06:48:36,730 --> 06:48:37,770
It's small?

6517
06:48:37,930 --> 06:48:38,730
Use the scope.

6518
06:48:40,770 --> 06:48:42,350
If it's small...

6519
06:48:44,490 --> 06:48:45,510
Can I get this guy?

6520
06:48:54,190 --> 06:48:54,990
Gulper eel!

6521
06:49:00,290 --> 06:49:01,870
That thing is so gross.

6522
06:49:02,030 --> 06:49:03,790
Wait, that's not like a rare fish, is it?

6523
06:49:05,430 --> 06:49:06,170
Not a relic.

6524
06:49:06,310 --> 06:49:06,770
It's a rare fish.

6525
06:49:08,510 --> 06:49:09,150
Gulper eel!

6526
06:49:09,630 --> 06:49:10,490
Oh my gosh, it is!

6527
06:49:13,750 --> 06:49:14,590
I got it!

6528
06:49:22,120 --> 06:49:23,180
That was so easy.

6529
06:49:23,280 --> 06:49:24,640
That was way easier than the other one.

6530
06:49:24,740 --> 06:49:25,880
Why was that one so much easier?

6531
06:49:31,380 --> 06:49:32,080
Hey lady!

6532
06:49:32,880 --> 06:49:33,900
Hey lady!

6533
06:49:43,360 --> 06:49:45,520
Nothing in my crabs.

6534
06:49:48,100 --> 06:49:50,120
Easiest rare fish is just hanging out.

6535
06:49:50,240 --> 06:49:51,220
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

6536
06:49:52,120 --> 06:49:52,900
Hello lady.

6537
06:49:53,180 --> 06:49:54,760
Do I get two more researchers?

6538
06:49:55,840 --> 06:49:56,560
That's great news.

6539
06:49:56,680 --> 06:49:57,700
Oh my god, I do!

6540
06:49:58,620 --> 06:49:59,020
What?

6541
06:50:02,060 --> 06:50:04,840
I got all the information I need.

6542
06:50:23,830 --> 06:50:25,310
Now we...

6543
06:50:25,310 --> 06:50:26,890
I don't have anything I need to store.

6544
06:50:27,410 --> 06:50:28,050
Just sell.

6545
06:50:31,250 --> 06:50:31,990
500!

6546
06:50:31,990 --> 06:50:32,770
100!

6547
06:50:37,660 --> 06:50:38,260
Wow.

6548
06:50:40,000 --> 06:50:42,140
We're just printing money at this point.

6549
06:50:42,640 --> 06:50:43,600
Goodness gracious.

6550
06:50:53,670 --> 06:50:55,250
I guess I'll rest.

6551
06:50:55,790 --> 06:50:58,770
I can't tell if this thing is...

6552
06:50:58,770 --> 06:51:01,750
If this thing I'm looking for is a...

6553
06:51:02,370 --> 06:51:06,810
A fishy that should be at night or awake or what.

6554
06:51:08,590 --> 06:51:10,070
Still no cloth.

6555
06:51:13,310 --> 06:51:14,190
Oh yeah.

6556
06:51:15,150 --> 06:51:16,430
Yeah, still no cloth.

6557
06:51:17,710 --> 06:51:18,170
What's this?

6558
06:51:18,430 --> 06:51:19,790
These look like they're just little fish.

6559
06:51:21,010 --> 06:51:21,510
What are you?

6560
06:51:23,150 --> 06:51:23,830
You know what?

6561
06:51:23,830 --> 06:51:24,550
I'll take some wood.

6562
06:51:31,850 --> 06:51:33,030
You want an actual hint?

6563
06:51:33,150 --> 06:51:34,910
Yes, I would love an actual hint.

6564
06:51:40,120 --> 06:51:43,240
I would love an actual hint because I...

6565
06:51:43,240 --> 06:51:46,700
I want to complete that quest.

6566
06:51:51,040 --> 06:51:52,800
It's around here at any time.

6567
06:51:53,920 --> 06:51:55,180
Look for red eyes in the water.

6568
06:51:55,800 --> 06:51:57,420
Oh, I know where that is though.

6569
06:51:59,180 --> 06:52:00,000
These guys.

6570
06:52:00,000 --> 06:52:00,160
There's...

6571
06:52:06,250 --> 06:52:08,670
But these are like this... I always get this guy.

6572
06:52:08,750 --> 06:52:09,450
I thought it was this.

6573
06:52:10,290 --> 06:52:11,050
The loose jaw.

6574
06:52:18,770 --> 06:52:19,790
Maybe there's some more.

6575
06:52:27,690 --> 06:52:30,150
Bangtooth are more towards the outside of the map.

6576
06:52:32,130 --> 06:52:36,010
Are you just saying that to get me to go towards the outside of the map and then something's gonna eat me?

6577
06:52:37,610 --> 06:52:39,550
Feels like a Subnautica situation.

6578
06:52:39,550 --> 06:52:41,910
And then

6579
06:52:48,080 --> 06:52:49,700
these guys are the angler fish.

6580
06:52:52,440 --> 06:52:55,160
Are you looking for tiger mackerel or goliath?

6581
06:52:55,360 --> 06:52:56,140
Tiger mackerel.

6582
06:52:56,800 --> 06:52:57,580
Tiger mackerel.

6583
06:52:57,640 --> 06:52:59,720
I'm looking... I want to complete...

6584
06:53:01,740 --> 06:53:02,680
This... No!

6585
06:53:03,720 --> 06:53:04,360
Fangtooth!

6586
06:53:04,660 --> 06:53:06,440
It's not a tiger mackerel at all.

6587
06:53:06,600 --> 06:53:07,640
It's a Fangtooth.

6588
06:53:10,400 --> 06:53:12,960
I want to complete this quest.

6589
06:53:13,840 --> 06:53:14,140
You

6590
06:53:19,920 --> 06:53:22,320
might be on top of it.

6591
06:53:22,360 --> 06:53:23,140
No, I'm not.

6592
06:53:23,240 --> 06:53:24,360
These are angler fish.

6593
06:53:46,810 --> 06:53:48,550
What about over here?

6594
06:53:49,170 --> 06:53:49,770
Oh wait!

6595
06:53:49,770 --> 06:53:52,430
Could it be?

6596
06:53:58,030 --> 06:53:59,550
A Fangtooth!

6597
06:54:00,070 --> 06:54:00,550
Fang!

6598
06:54:11,160 --> 06:54:11,920
I

6599
06:54:18,380 --> 06:54:21,160
think I could... Wait.

6600
06:54:22,360 --> 06:54:23,680
Oh no, I'm going inside.

6601
06:54:25,660 --> 06:54:28,800
If we go around... I think we can deliver it to him.

6602
06:54:34,440 --> 06:54:36,460
We finally found it.

6603
06:54:49,940 --> 06:54:50,640
No!

6604
06:54:51,860 --> 06:54:55,260
You will not whisper sweet nothings into my ear.

6605
06:54:56,740 --> 06:54:58,740
Now I don't know where he is.

6606
06:54:59,340 --> 06:54:59,640
Wait!

6607
06:55:01,080 --> 06:55:01,760
Oh my god!

6608
06:55:06,950 --> 06:55:08,970
I know where he is.

6609
06:55:14,080 --> 06:55:14,440
Mister!

6610
06:55:18,380 --> 06:55:19,080
Mister!

6611
06:55:20,460 --> 06:55:22,180
Sorry I kept you waiting, huh?

6612
06:55:25,580 --> 06:55:26,720
Here you go.

6613
06:55:28,680 --> 06:55:32,420
They bring this small fish up to their mouth and bite at where the heart is.

6614
06:55:32,780 --> 06:55:35,700
Their cracked lips part to reveal a row of sharpened teeth.

6615
06:55:36,500 --> 06:55:37,720
Sense an opening.

6616
06:55:38,500 --> 06:55:40,080
They unfurl the final scroll.

6617
06:55:44,320 --> 06:55:45,520
Oh crab!

6618
06:55:49,480 --> 06:55:50,820
Hi, hi, hi.

6619
06:55:51,720 --> 06:55:52,200
What the?

6620
06:55:57,910 --> 06:55:59,290
Guys, what is that?

6621
06:56:09,890 --> 06:56:10,890
It's a ghost ship.

6622
06:56:14,170 --> 06:56:15,750
No, foghorn!

6623
06:56:16,350 --> 06:56:16,950
Scary!

6624
06:56:18,670 --> 06:56:20,170
It's a rare event, really?

6625
06:56:21,130 --> 06:56:21,910
I'm scared.

6626
06:56:25,590 --> 06:56:26,790
Go say hi.

6627
06:56:26,990 --> 06:56:29,310
I've already dealt with two ships!

6628
06:56:33,390 --> 06:56:34,710
It's big.

6629
06:56:43,320 --> 06:56:44,540
Oh it's gone.

6630
06:56:56,050 --> 06:56:56,610
Wait.

6631
06:56:59,810 --> 06:57:00,370
And...

6632
06:57:06,840 --> 06:57:07,880
I'll sleep here.

6633
06:57:08,680 --> 06:57:09,720
Hello photographer lady.

6634
06:57:10,420 --> 06:57:12,780
I hope you don't mind if I just...

6635
06:57:14,980 --> 06:57:16,800
That was so cool!

6636
06:57:18,680 --> 06:57:19,740
Oh I used up all my resources.

6637
06:57:20,040 --> 06:57:20,480
Good night!

6638
06:57:22,340 --> 06:57:24,440
I scared him.

6639
06:57:24,560 --> 06:57:26,800
Well I guess we know who the better ghost is.

6640
06:57:29,000 --> 06:57:34,480
You know, not everyone can be as terrifying and...

6641
06:57:35,580 --> 06:57:39,540
You know, as spooky as I and everything.

6642
06:57:46,200 --> 06:57:47,680
I'm just saying.

6643
06:57:59,000 --> 06:58:00,760
Oh that's where her camera was.

6644
06:58:09,900 --> 06:58:13,440
Alrighty, we're back here because I know we can get some blue crab.

6645
06:58:16,080 --> 06:58:17,920
And we're just collecting fish on the way.

6646
06:58:18,360 --> 06:58:19,340
We're making bank.

6647
06:58:20,280 --> 06:58:20,900
Oh crackers!

6648
06:58:21,860 --> 06:58:23,860
Julius, thank you so much for the raid!

6649
06:58:24,140 --> 06:58:24,880
Thank you, thank you.

6650
06:58:24,980 --> 06:58:25,900
Welcome everybody.

6651
06:58:26,620 --> 06:58:28,480
We're playing dredge.

6652
06:58:28,480 --> 06:58:33,540
It's a game where you fish and nothing creepy happens.

6653
06:58:34,320 --> 06:58:35,260
Ignore that.

6654
06:58:40,770 --> 06:58:43,470
Alright, I think we need to fix my little crab gun.

6655
06:58:44,550 --> 06:58:45,070
My pot.

6656
06:58:45,570 --> 06:58:45,890
Pick up.

6657
06:58:49,370 --> 06:58:50,190
Paper bags!

6658
06:58:50,310 --> 06:58:51,430
Thanks for the gift dude!

6659
06:58:52,170 --> 06:58:52,790
Thank you, thank you.

6660
06:59:00,640 --> 06:59:01,280
Fish?

6661
06:59:02,340 --> 06:59:02,720
Market.

6662
06:59:03,040 --> 06:59:04,540
First we gotta sell my fish.

6663
06:59:05,020 --> 06:59:06,760
I picked up some creepy guys.

6664
06:59:06,960 --> 06:59:07,860
Some creepy crawlies.

6665
06:59:09,920 --> 06:59:12,960
And then we're gonna repair everything.

6666
06:59:21,900 --> 06:59:23,520
Check your net before selling.

6667
06:59:23,640 --> 06:59:24,680
Maybe you caught some...

6668
06:59:26,160 --> 06:59:27,000
Oh crabs?

6669
06:59:27,100 --> 06:59:29,080
I don't think you can catch crabs in your net, can you?

6670
06:59:29,780 --> 06:59:30,960
I never have.

6671
06:59:31,560 --> 06:59:31,960
Nashi!

6672
06:59:32,620 --> 06:59:34,180
Thank you for the farm gift dude!

6673
06:59:35,020 --> 06:59:35,960
Lockstech, welcome to membership.

6674
06:59:36,060 --> 06:59:37,160
Thank you, thank you guys.

6675
06:59:37,960 --> 06:59:38,440
Let's see.

6676
06:59:40,620 --> 06:59:41,720
Large crab pot.

6677
06:59:42,540 --> 06:59:42,860
Release!

6678
06:59:44,940 --> 06:59:46,920
Alright, now we just chill around here.

6679
06:59:50,430 --> 06:59:51,490
Oh, store my wood.

6680
06:59:51,570 --> 06:59:52,350
Wait, do I still have it?

6681
06:59:52,690 --> 06:59:53,470
Oh, you're right!

6682
06:59:53,590 --> 06:59:55,370
Thank you for letting me know.

6683
06:59:56,570 --> 06:59:57,510
Thank you, thank you.

6684
07:00:08,210 --> 07:00:14,530
Let's go get some... There were some other... Where those red eyed fish were, there were some other abyssal stuff.

6685
07:00:14,630 --> 07:00:16,210
We can maybe see if...

6686
07:00:23,200 --> 07:00:24,120
Something's hungry.

6687
07:00:24,660 --> 07:00:25,840
That's totally me.

6688
07:00:28,800 --> 07:00:31,640
Oh, I thought I saw a disturbed water.

6689
07:00:34,660 --> 07:00:35,860
Loose jaw.

6690
07:00:36,820 --> 07:00:38,220
Angler fish.

6691
07:00:38,820 --> 07:00:39,500
Barracuda.

6692
07:00:42,300 --> 07:00:42,980
Barracuda.

6693
07:00:43,800 --> 07:00:44,860
Red snapper.

6694
07:00:45,100 --> 07:00:45,720
Barracuda.

6695
07:00:46,540 --> 07:00:49,800
Gosh, how are we so good at seeing?

6696
07:00:50,080 --> 07:00:52,360
We are like the most experienced fisher ever.

6697
07:00:52,900 --> 07:00:56,100
We can see their swim patterns and we're like, we know what that is.

6698
07:00:56,520 --> 07:00:58,000
We know what that is!

6699
07:00:58,020 --> 07:00:58,500
Easy peasy.

6700
07:01:01,700 --> 07:01:03,000
Is that cloth?

6701
07:01:03,080 --> 07:01:03,360
No!

6702
07:01:03,840 --> 07:01:05,640
Unfortunately, it was...

6703
07:01:07,360 --> 07:01:08,800
It was wood.

6704
07:01:09,780 --> 07:01:10,000
Can

6705
07:01:16,260 --> 07:01:19,240
you fish ducks here?

6706
07:01:20,140 --> 07:01:23,000
Asking for a friend who wants to be fished by a cute ghost.

6707
07:01:29,280 --> 07:01:31,600
There's no ducks in these waters.

6708
07:01:33,900 --> 07:01:36,620
What if there used to be ducks in these waters?

6709
07:01:48,400 --> 07:01:49,920
No crab yet.

6710
07:01:50,920 --> 07:01:52,100
No crab yet.

6711
07:01:52,200 --> 07:01:53,880
I'm just gonna wander around a little bit.

6712
07:01:54,900 --> 07:01:56,100
Maybe we'll catch something.

6713
07:02:04,860 --> 07:02:07,620
I don't think I've been around this side actually.

6714
07:02:07,860 --> 07:02:11,680
I haven't really seen this area.

6715
07:02:11,940 --> 07:02:12,700
Or maybe I have.

6716
07:02:15,640 --> 07:02:16,820
Maybe I don't want to.

6717
07:02:20,480 --> 07:02:22,480
Leave me alone!

6718
07:02:24,720 --> 07:02:26,780
I don't want the whispers.

6719
07:02:41,420 --> 07:02:43,240
Anchovies are so cute.

6720
07:02:44,280 --> 07:02:45,560
So itty bitty.

6721
07:02:47,220 --> 07:02:47,900
This will sleep.

6722
07:02:55,460 --> 07:02:57,000
Blue crab.

6723
07:02:58,040 --> 07:02:58,540
Yes!

6724
07:02:59,860 --> 07:03:00,380
Go home.

6725
07:03:06,220 --> 07:03:08,500
We need this guy for a quest.

6726
07:03:11,800 --> 07:03:13,280
Ignore everything else.

6727
07:03:13,960 --> 07:03:15,440
What are the stones for?

6728
07:03:15,520 --> 07:03:16,580
I still don't know that yet.

6729
07:03:20,580 --> 07:03:21,620
Wood is cute.

6730
07:03:21,880 --> 07:03:23,720
The crab is pretty cute.

6731
07:03:26,100 --> 07:03:28,000
He's about to get his heart ripped out though.

6732
07:03:37,540 --> 07:03:40,440
Catch 150 fish in trawl net.

6733
07:03:42,260 --> 07:03:43,200
No, it is over here.

6734
07:03:45,360 --> 07:03:46,440
Minky is cute.

6735
07:03:54,940 --> 07:03:56,240
Telling lies?

6736
07:03:56,380 --> 07:03:57,040
No papa.

6737
07:03:57,940 --> 07:03:58,860
Open your mouth.

6738
07:04:05,000 --> 07:04:06,500
Sense an opening.

6739
07:04:07,080 --> 07:04:07,880
Here's your crab.

6740
07:04:08,820 --> 07:04:12,580
They crack and bend the crab's legs apart and feast on the flesh inside.

6741
07:04:13,620 --> 07:04:18,700
Lips still covered in crab flesh, they take a book from inside their robe and hand it to you.

6742
07:04:19,740 --> 07:04:20,660
Answer given.

6743
07:04:21,060 --> 07:04:22,300
We await summons.

6744
07:04:22,760 --> 07:04:24,860
They cross their arms and appear to fall into a deep sleep.

6745
07:04:28,320 --> 07:04:29,240
Advance fishing.

6746
07:04:31,240 --> 07:04:32,220
I'm a fisherman.

6747
07:04:32,420 --> 07:04:34,080
This is related to me.

6748
07:04:36,660 --> 07:04:37,120
Lazuli!

6749
07:04:37,880 --> 07:04:39,280
Thank you for the raid!

6750
07:04:40,200 --> 07:04:41,660
Hello, hello, hello!

6751
07:04:42,540 --> 07:04:43,720
Wait, didn't you just debut?

6752
07:04:44,620 --> 07:04:45,140
Congratulations!

6753
07:04:47,760 --> 07:04:49,200
He's trying to be more very cute.

6754
07:04:50,460 --> 07:04:50,980
Stupid.

6755
07:04:52,060 --> 07:04:52,980
Hello, hello!

6756
07:04:53,440 --> 07:04:54,540
Peachy, peachy raid.

6757
07:04:55,060 --> 07:04:55,700
So cute.

6758
07:04:55,800 --> 07:04:56,880
Mervy, thanks for the fun game!

6759
07:04:59,260 --> 07:05:01,820
I just noticed there's like other robes there.

6760
07:05:02,160 --> 07:05:03,880
Does he change or are those his friends?

6761
07:05:04,440 --> 07:05:05,280
Did he eat them?

6762
07:05:05,380 --> 07:05:06,280
I have so many questions.

6763
07:05:09,080 --> 07:05:09,520
Alrighty.

6764
07:05:10,740 --> 07:05:12,700
I'm gonna remove the marker.

6765
07:05:17,920 --> 07:05:18,900
This one too.

6766
07:05:19,580 --> 07:05:20,760

Wait, that's actually so funny.

6890
07:09:54,140 --> 07:09:55,180
I was just thinking about...

6891
07:09:55,180 --> 07:09:58,820
When a streamer...

6892
07:09:58,820 --> 07:10:00,520
You could try this with...

6893
07:10:00,520 --> 07:10:06,560
If you follow any Japanese Vtubers or Japanese streamers When they're ending, you can be like...

6894
07:10:06,560 --> 07:10:07,800
Kita bakari!

6895
07:10:08,600 --> 07:10:09,720
Kita bakari!

6896
07:10:09,940 --> 07:10:12,500
It means, I just got here!

6897
07:10:12,500 --> 07:10:14,080
Kita bakari!

6898
07:10:15,700 --> 07:10:17,060
When they're ending.

6899
07:10:19,420 --> 07:10:20,940

6900
07:10:24,320 --> 07:10:25,460

6901
07:10:26,600 --> 07:10:28,680
It means, I just got here!

6902
07:10:32,280 --> 07:10:34,100
Ki, not hita.

6903
07:10:34,420 --> 07:10:35,800
Ki, ki, ki...

6904
07:10:36,040 --> 07:10:36,980
Kita bakari.

6905
07:10:37,480 --> 07:10:40,500
Ki, ki, ki...

6906
07:10:40,500 --> 07:10:41,260
Kita bakari.

6907
07:10:41,460 --> 07:10:43,440
That's your Japanese lesson for today.

6908
07:10:44,380 --> 07:10:45,300
Kita bakari.

6909
07:10:45,620 --> 07:10:46,820
Bakari is when you say...

6910
07:10:46,820 --> 07:10:49,220
You use it when it's something very recent.

6911
07:10:50,480 --> 07:10:52,360
Or something that...

6912
07:10:53,580 --> 07:10:54,580
Happens often.

6913
07:10:55,000 --> 07:10:55,640
Or a lot.

6914
07:10:55,900 --> 07:10:57,080
So it's like...

6915
07:10:57,080 --> 07:10:59,100
If you're just like...

6916
07:10:59,100 --> 07:11:01,780
If someone says, do you want to go eat spaghetti?

6917
07:11:02,060 --> 07:11:03,380
And you're like, ah, spaghetti!

6918
07:11:03,500 --> 07:11:04,160
Tabeta bakari!

6919
07:11:04,960 --> 07:11:07,500
Then it's like, oh, I just ate spaghetti.

6920
07:11:07,500 --> 07:11:08,740
So maybe not that, you know?

6921
07:11:11,400 --> 07:11:12,700
And then, kita.

6922
07:11:13,400 --> 07:11:15,500
Kuru is like...

6923
07:11:16,300 --> 07:11:19,900
To arrive.

6924
07:11:24,360 --> 07:11:25,080
Wakarimashita.

6925
07:11:25,360 --> 07:11:26,680

6926
07:11:27,540 --> 07:11:29,480
It's pretty useful.

6927
07:11:29,700 --> 07:11:31,780

6929
07:11:35,560 --> 07:11:37,720
You'll hear it quite often.

6930
07:11:38,340 --> 07:11:39,840
Spaghetti-chan.

6931
07:11:42,020 --> 07:11:43,120
Spaghetti-chan.

6932
07:11:44,480 --> 07:11:44,940
