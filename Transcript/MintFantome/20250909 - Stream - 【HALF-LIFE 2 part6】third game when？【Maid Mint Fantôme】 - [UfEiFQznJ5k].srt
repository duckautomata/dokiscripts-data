1
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,340
Hello, hello, hello gamers!

2
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,660
Welcome back to the end of Half-Life 2!

3
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,520
Yubi!

4
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,760
My glasses are really big today.

5
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
So that I can...

6
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,820
Dude, uh, so smart.

7
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,520
Logan, welcome back.

8
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,300
Why are her glasses like that?

9
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,700
Because she's a ghost.

10
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,040
Nah, why are her glasses like that?

11
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,080
But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,860
Um, I'm glad to...

13
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,060
What?

14
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,720
Oh my gosh, I just noticed!

15
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,980
Is that him?

16
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,020
Is that the G, man?

17
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
In the window?

18
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,120
Cool.

19
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,160
Never mind, he's gone.

20
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,540
What?

21
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,740
That's me.

22
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
What are you doing there?

23
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:15,940
What?

24
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,060
What are you doing there?

25
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
It's dangerous.

26
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,260
He's shy.

27
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,780
Does he come back?

28
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
Oh my gosh.

29
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,300
Oh, he was so sassy for a second.

30
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,340
Can...

31
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,520
Wait.

32
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,140
You can see Half-Life 3 with those glasses.

33
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,240
Oh yeah, baby.

34
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,940
Oh yeah.

35
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,180
Though after this.

36
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,460
I know that there's like episode 1 and 2.

37
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,200
But I'm feeling a little burnt out on Half-Life right now.

38
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm still enjoying.

39
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,100
Oh.

40
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,440
Sassy.

41
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,320
I'm still having fun.

42
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
I think just, you know, I want to play other games.

43
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,460
So.

44
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,740
I'll come back maybe.

45
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,660
For like Alex.

46
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,600
And then.

47
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:32,480
maybe episode one and two so yeah it's fine to give it a rest of two who knows maybe something will be announced wouldn't it be insane if i like the next summer whatever directs or awards or whatever those things are called

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:40,940

50
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,360
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

51
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,720
Good, good, good, good.

52
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,360
Joshua, thank you so much for the podcast.

53
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,440
Four to five hours each, probably.

54
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Oh, that's like nothing.

55
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:49,940
Okay.

56
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,340
Well, then whenever I feel like coming back to Half-Life, we can do those and then Alex.

57
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,180
So...

58
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,460
Timberto, thank you!

59
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,080
I was your other...

60
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,820
Is your main account still not good?

61
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,020
Episode 1 plus 2 together are basically Half-Life 3.

62
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
If not Half-Life 2.5.

63
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,420
So it's like Peace Walker.

64
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,620
But Peace Walker is really Metal Gear 5.

65
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,520
Just made it.

66
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,280
Welcome in, welcome in, welcome in!

67
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,800
Alex needs VR.

68
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Yes, I did know that.

69
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,220
And I do have VR.

70
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,340
That's also partially why I'm a little...

71
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,960
A little nervous about it.

72
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,340
Because I'm like, what if I get so sick?

73
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,320
Okay, so thank you for the five good to thank you!

74
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,780
You have VR?

75
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,500
I do!

76
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,840
Wait, let me not see my VR streams.

77
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,640
My other account is still no good.

78
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

79
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,280
Thank you for the super nice.

80
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,140
A 3D Alex stream.

81
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Oh, maybe I could try.

82
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,860
Speaking of 3D, oh my gosh.

83
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,260
My 3D debut concert is like in less than a month.

84
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,180
I saw some, I got some stuff, some confirmation stuff about it.

85
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
Uh, recently.

86
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,740
Lucky, thanks for the vibe, get dead.

87
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,580
We have a date?

88
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,920
Yeah, it'll be on my birthday.

89
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,480
I guess I should probably start advertising.

90
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,760
Well, at first I wasn't sure if it would be done in time, but now it seems it will be.

91
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,260
This is my thanks for being at Vexbo.

92
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,840
Yes, that's it.

93
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,040
Congrats on getting the stand here.

94
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,480
Stinky.

95
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,560
No, not stinky.

96
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,310
Okay, I'll start advertising it.

97
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,110
Because it's costing me a lot of money.

98
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,250
Okay.

99
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,930
Half-life 2.

100
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,270
Ending!

101
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,550
Staddle!

102
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,410
Where do we load?

103
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,750
Oh, follow Freeman!

104
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,750
Where did we end off?

105
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,170
Oh.

106
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,290
Oh, I saw you?

107
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,790
Oh god.

108
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,910
Okay, I'm already hearing so many stuff.

109
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,930
It's your birthday?

110
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,950
It's not my birthday!

111
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,170
This is where we came from.

112
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,070
Yeah, don't look, don't listen, don't look at, don't listen to that.

113
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,370
Yeah, excuse me.

114
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,490
Excuse me.

115
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,780
I'm just gonna run for it.

116
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,760
The horse?

117
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,480
What's... Oh my god!

118
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,720
We were looking to join you, Dr. Freeman.

119
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,580
That's a man!

120
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,840
That's a man!

121
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,820
Right there!

122
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,140
Music goes hard.

123
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,560
Ah!

124
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,980
Where'd you guys come from?

125
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,740
Come on, let me turn it down just a tad.

126
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,500
Okay, well.

127
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's go, team.

128
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,100
We got the squad.

129
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,060
Bam.

130
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,180
Nice.

131
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
Did you pick up something?

132
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,320
Good job.

133
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
This is so much to get into all of a sudden.

134
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,340
We're fine.

135
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,560
We're not fine.

136
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,900
We're...

137
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,240
Are

138
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,480
you okay?

139
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,420
Oh.

140
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,750
They're dropping their things.

141
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,090
I should pick them up.

142
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,170
Glasses are huge.

143
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,690
I just wanted to get this.

144
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,130
I keep pressing G.

145
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,670
I don't know why.

146
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,130
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,090
Oh, yeah.

148
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,470
This is where we're going.

149
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,370
Got it.

150
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,790
But this guy...

151
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,290
No, no, I can help you.

152
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,010
Oh, I took his stuff.

153
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,070
Oh, team!

154
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,830
What happened?

155
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:42,990
Oh,

156
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,260
wait.

157
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,960
How do I get in there?

158
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,800
Get in there.

159
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,320
Get in there.

160
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,160
There we go.

161
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,920
Nice, nice, nice.

162
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,800
I can help you lose body.

163
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,780
These things... How am I supposed to take it out, though?

164
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,430
I don't see any rockets.

165
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,050
Don't stand so close!

166
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,670
Yeah, come over here.

167
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,210
I can't hear anything.

168
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,950
I can't hear myself.

169
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,270
Okay.

170
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,670
Alright, I saved, so we're gonna run for it.

171
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,810
Oops.

172
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,010
I thought I reloaded.

173
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,950
Where's my team?

174
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:53,830
Team?

175
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:55,970
Team?

176
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:57,850
Dude!

177
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,240
We lost him?

178
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,680
How?

179
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,480
No, I think they're probably still waiting over there.

180
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,720
Probably.

181
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,120
Okay, hold on.

182
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,680
We're gonna wait for him to walk back.

183
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,680
I mean, I could go between his legs.

184
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:17,980
A little freaky.

185
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,330
And as soon as he...

186
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:26,690
Okay.

187
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:27,890
Oh my god.

188
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,050
Rocket box.

189
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,430
Rocket box?

190
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,890
No rocket box.

191
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,290
Excuse me.

192
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,510
You know what?

193
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,730
I don't just do this.

194
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,390
I don't usually like doing that.

195
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,170
Because I don't like getting this stuff.

196
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,670
That's fine.

197
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,090
Niels, thank you so much for the pink!

198
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,230
Can't make the Super 2 big since I'm poor after buying so much for my Yavi booth.

199
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,250
Yeah, let's go!

200
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,570
Wait, I think that he's shooting at my team!

201
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,830
Sorry, friends.

202
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:05,610
Oh!

203
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,330
Oh!

204
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:11,930
Um,

205
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,310
welcome back.

206
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:16,850
Thank you!

207
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,690
He doesn't see me.

208
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,490
He sees me.

209
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,930
Oh my god, I'm stuck on the door!

210
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,670
I don't know where you guys are, but hopefully that gets you.

211
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,950
What's that sound?

212
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,530
What's that sound?

213
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,750
What's that sound?

214
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,540
Who are you?

215
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,780
I don't think I can get him from here.

216
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,020
Oh my gosh.

217
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,380
I have to go up.

218
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,880
I have to run up.

219
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,780
Oh, I'm killing your buddy.

220
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,900
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

221
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,580
Okay, we're fine.

222
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:54,770
thought it was a smoke alarm battery I had no idea what I was expecting everything's fine ish I hope my team's okay wherever they are whatever they're doing I hope they're okay not following me follow Freeman they said they said They'll be fine.

223
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,510
Yeah, okay.

224
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,610
Oh, I was like, there's gotta be one in here.

225
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,390
Alright, now we go.

226
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,240
Oh, that's my team!

227
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,960
Who are you?

228
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,340
Where did you come from?

229
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,260
What?

230
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,780
Where are you?

231
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,640
Who are you people?

232
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,850
Are they coming down?

233
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,910
Oh my gosh, I'm missing every shot.

234
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,760
I tried.

235
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,680
Oh thank you.

236
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,620
Do you need one too?

237
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Probably?

238
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:55,730
Ouch!

239
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,190
Ouch!

240
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:56,430
Ouch!

241
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,270
There's too many!

242
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,650
There's too many of them!

243
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,830
You too!

244
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,110
Oh my gosh.

245
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,350
They just... Don't stop coming!

246
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,470
I'm reloading!

247
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,820
Back to Sender.

248
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,900
I didn't get him though.

249
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,760
It was kind of sad.

250
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,880
Okay.

251
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,020
I think they're coming.

252
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,820
I hear them running.

253
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,520
Yeah, drop your gun.

254
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,960
Thank you.

255
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,100
Hey, hi.

256
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,280
You're hurt.

257
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,080
You're my last one left.

258
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,220
Stay in here.

259
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,940
Everybody died so fast.

260
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,660
Like almost immediately, actually.

261
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,400
Oh my god.

262
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,780
I think we just gotta keep going.

263
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,340
Maybe they don't stop coming.

264
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,650
Oh my gosh.

265
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,530
Strider, go inside!

266
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,250
Go inside!

267
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,710
Oh,

268
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,710
you're the only one left?

269
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,410
I can't keep people at all.

270
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,710
All my relationships.

271
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,790
Okay, but...

272
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,350

273
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,210
It's fine.

274
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,510

Use all Dr. Freeman.

302
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,200
This thing has, like, no range.

303
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't do that!

304
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,340
Oh.

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Oh, I'm gonna go this way?

307
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,310
You look like Gray Fox.

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,300
Wow.

314
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Okay, nice.

315
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,340
I'm gonna save.

316
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,940
Oh, you were so close to safety.

317
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:25,600
Woo!

318
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,180
My friends.

319
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,080
Don't...

320
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,320
Uh-oh.

321
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, uh-oh.

322
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,120
Don't stand there.

323
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,130
Don't just stand there, buddy.

324
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,030
Don't just stand there, buddy.

325
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,090
There's bad news.

326
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,230
Wow, they give you so much here.

327
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,490
Okay.

328
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,070
He died?

329
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,310
I'm a lone wolf.

330
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,810
It's fine.

331
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,590
And they also don't stop coming.

332
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,690
Where'd you come from?

333
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:00,850
Hello.

334
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,090
Hello, Dr. Freeman.

335
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:02,450
Oh.

336
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,250
She responded.

337
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:04,950
That's so sweet.

338
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,850
Oh.

339
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:12,730
Why does...

340
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,110
everybody I love, die!

341
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,680
More ammo?

342
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,960
Yeah, we'll take that.

343
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,080
Is he gonna blow this up?

344
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,440
Oh, wait!

345
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,320
I think I go in here?

346
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,220
Oh, I go in here.

347
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:29,660
Okay.

348
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,830
Go somewhere.

349
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,330
Oh my gosh, it's a...

350
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,950
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

351
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,270
Team, team, team!

352
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,730
It's time!

353
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,610
It's time, team!

354
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,250
Oh, geez.

355
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,130
It's time.

356
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,450
Squad.

357
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,250
Um, who are we?

358
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:58,950
Who are we?

359
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,570
Where is he?

360
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,730
There is he.

361
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,890
There he is.

362
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,010
Okay.

363
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,310
Oh my god, there's two of them.

364
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,480
Hey, it's free.

365
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm scared.

366
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm just gonna keep saving.

367
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,220
Oh, my team is dying!

368
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,220
Ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

369
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,700
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, oh, I'm such an idiot.

370
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,380
Oh, my gosh.

371
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,760
Sorry, I didn't notice the wall.

372
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,120
Oh, it's like playing Doom all over again.

373
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,600
They don't stop!

374
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,600
Oh,

375
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,940
my friends!

376
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,950
Oh, Combine, too!

377
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,330
Oh, my gosh.

378
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:44,730
Okay.

379
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,060
Alright, I gotta go.

380
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,460
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

381
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,640
Oh my friends

382
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,320
are...

383
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,780
I wish a medic would stay alive so they could heal me.

384
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,320
Did that get you?

385
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,240
No, that didn't get you.

386
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,840
Wait, can he give me a...

387
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,200
Thank you.

388
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

389
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,180
Okay, I need you to get out of my way.

390
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,960
Like, for real.

391
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,880
I need you to get out of my way.

392
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,400
The Strider killed her?

393
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,640
Okay, as long as it wasn't me.

394
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,340
We're gonna focus on one at a time, you know?

395
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,520
Wait!

396
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,840
I think I took...

397
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,170
Oh, oh, oh, oh, team!

398
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:02,810
Okay.

399
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,490
Wait for me, Dr. Freeman.

400
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,370
I'll come with you.

401
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,930
Oh my gosh.

402
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,270
Thank you.

403
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,790
I'm glad there's so many people, though.

404
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,490
I just came out.

405
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,030
Uh, just wait.

406
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,280
Oh, chill, chill, chill, chill.

407
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,140
Dr. Freeman, I'm coming with you.

408
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:30,740
Thank you.

409
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,580
Can I get a med kit?

410
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:35,980
Thanks.

411
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,600
They're doing their best.

412
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,680
Was that down?

413
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:49,940
Nope.

414
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:50,840
Dang it.

415
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,580
Oh, thank you so much.

416
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,760
So generous.

417
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,340
So generous.

418
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:01,750
These guys.

419
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,550
Survive the rooftop strider battle.

420
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,270
We did it!

421
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,810
Wait.

422
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,850
I did it!

423
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,430
Let's go!

424
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,390
But there's still guys, right?

425
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,150
Yeah, I wonder if I could, like, get them with this.

426
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,570
Where are they, though?

427
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,230
Oh, maybe a little up.

428
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,610
Like that.

429
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,630
What's the horse?

430
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:39,750
What?

431
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,870
Down there?

432
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:41,710
Maybe?

433
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,290
And for the whores.

434
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:46,970
Overkill?

435
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,710
I don't care.

436
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,770
I hear more guys.

437
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,110
I've lost my whole team.

438
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,090
So sad.

439
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,490
I have free rockets.

440
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,230
Why not?

441
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,910
Well, this is where we came from.

442
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,530
Okay, I see what's going on here.

443
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,750
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

444
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,970
Okay, sorry.

445
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,410
I'm just getting my bearings a little bit.

446
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,670
Okay.

447
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:12,810
Let's go.

448
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:15,990
Hello, team.

450
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,970
Actually, team, I'm not quite sure where we go.

451
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,370
Team, am I here?

452
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,650
And then over there?

453
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,250
Wait, is that where I came from?

454
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:25,990
Ah!

455
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,130
No, dang it.

456
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,690
This is where I was.

457
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,270
The horse is on a pillar.

458
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,230
Ah!

459
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,850
Okay, I got it.

460
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,730
I gotta go back.

461
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,660
The horse.

462
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,060
So I go...

463
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,340
Oh, the pillar!

464
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,120
Wait, these?

465
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,520
Okay.

466
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,280
Um, cover me!

467
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,720
Everybody cover me!

468
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,160
Cover me, everybody, cover me!

469
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,380
Everybody...

470
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:08,880
Cover me!

471
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,000
Cover me, everybody, cover me!

472
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,340
That's my friends.

473
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,170
Oh!

474
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,210
Oopsie.

475
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,450
Anybody got a med kit?

476
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,010
I crunched that good.

477
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,890
My ankles are broken.

478
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,270
My ankles are broken, guys.

479
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,210
The horse is down!

480
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,410
The horse is down!

481
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:53,770
Dog!

482
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:55,830
Dog!

483
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,340
Let's go.

484
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,040
Go dog.

485
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,740
Go dog.

486
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Behind me!

487
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,620
Behind me!

488
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,260
Behind me!

489
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,580
Behind me!

490
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,000
He's crashing through the plaza, knocking over walls, and I think he's looking for Alex.

491
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,260
He seems to have it set in his head that she's in the citadel.

492
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,640
I figured Alex wouldn't want him getting any deeper in trouble, but hell, you try stopping him.

493
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,060
Okay.

494
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,800
All right.

495
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,440
My health is not great.

496
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
but I'll still save.

497
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,240
Maybe there's some supplies around here.

498
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,720
Something a little pick me up.

499
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,020
What's that sound?

500
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,720
What is that sound?

501
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,960
I see no supplies, this is fine.

502
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,960
They're waiting for me.

503
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

504
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,090
There, you can't get through that way.

505
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,850
He says drive.

506
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:28,190

the only f word ever said in a valve game by the way our benefactors we got to the next chapter I thought I would be playing with dog for a bit.

509
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,530
Let's go.

510
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,370
Oh, it's bats.

511
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,070
Freaking bats.

512
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,310
Nice teeth.

513
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,910
Skinny legend.

514
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,140
Oh, I see.

515
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,760
But it's...

516
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,200
Why the...

517
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,020
All the sounds...

518
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,320
Whoa!

519
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,780
This is insane.

520
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:37,920
Okay.

521
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,300
Don't look up.

522
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,640
Not quite exactly sure where we're going.

523
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,500
I don't, I feel like we should be going up, not doubt, but okay.

524
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,620
Oh, I almost did not make that.

525
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,680
Right

526
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:07,720
here.

527
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,500
Just jump to where you can land.

528
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,900
That's basically what I'm doing.

529
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,030
That's an entrance, right?

530
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,300
It is a passage.

531
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,180
passage of some sort

532
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,640

533
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:56,310

536
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,140
They increase my perception by two.

537
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,520
Those people?

538
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm just looking around.

539
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,260
Oh!

540
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,180
Plus two glasses.

541
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:57,800
Yeah.

542
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,730
What's that?

543
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,690
What's this owl?

544
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,560
Do they like how this game sometimes goes quiet?

545
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,120
Yeah.

546
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:21,900
Oh,

547
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,900
a lot of buzz.

548
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,880
What's the buzz about?

549
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,280
Where are they going?

550
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,580
Where am I going?

551
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,580
Where am I supposed to go?

552
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Guys, I'm lost.

553
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,470
To Disney?

554
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,310
Nice.

555
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,650
Forward.

556
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Like, oh, down here?

557
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,670
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

558
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,710
Yeah, that's what's happening to me.

559
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,080
I'll go in this one.

560
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,760
Oh, I'll go in this one.

561
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,060
Oh!

562
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,020
It worked!

563
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,020
Dang it?

564
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,100
Wait, was the other one gonna kill me?

565
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,260
No way.

566
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Wait, you didn't pick the...

567
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,360
The other one was that the Zapper kills you?

568
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,220
You guys are just gonna let me die.

569
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,380
This reminds me of the beginning of the game.

570
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,780
And of the first game, too.

571
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,770
When you're just, like, taking in all the atmosphere.

572
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:55,790
Whoa...

573
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,450
Which pod is mine?

574
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,510
Where am I gonna go?

575
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:06,650
Oh!

576
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,950
People!

577
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,970
Are they turning everyone into skinny legends?

578
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,430
Hi, and it's tiny whities!

579
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,330
Skinny eye and it's tiny whities!

580
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,630
I don't want to become that!

581
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,130
This is crazy.

582
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,350
Hate that.

583
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,190
Oh, this is terrible.

584
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,060
I love when games become movies.

585
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,160
Good time for hydration, so true.

586
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,800
Oh, sorry.

587
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,640
I hit my mouth.

588
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,720
Big ol' fingernails.

589
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,470
Striders remind me of Code Miyoko.

590
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,900
Are we going to the tippy top?

591
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,780
Where are we headed?

592
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,360
Unregistered weapons detected.

593
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,660
Wait, I can't move.

594
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,620
Oh, oh!

595
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,360
No, no, no, no, no, no!

596
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,650
I can use it on them.

597
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,690
Wait, it's now blue, I just realized.

598
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,650
I can use it on people!

599
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,390
Oh my gosh, I can use it on people!

600
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,270
I could use that people!

601
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,510
Oh, they're not people.

602
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:25,810
Oh!

603
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,510
Yeah!

604
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,670
So, this is Dr. Freeman.

605
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:41,650
At last.

606
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:48,870
I wish I could say this was a pleasant surprise, but it's neither a surprise nor, as you will surely agree, were it pleasant.

607
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,150
Well, I am nothing if not pragmatic.

608
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:52,870
What?

609
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,030
What?

610
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,250
wait i need them to come to me come here it's

611
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:32,160

612
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,290
how far can i Oh!

613
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,530
You

614
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,360
can rip the computers out?

615
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,170
Oh my god.

616
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,590
Oh my god.

617
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,910
I think the other one's bigger.

618
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,360
Through a grenade, but...

619
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,040
Yeah!

620
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,840
Take that!

621
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:28,220
property now unlimited power well dr. Freeman under other circumstances I like to think we might have been able to work together in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect certainly judging from your brief tenure at Black Mesa while I was its administrator you showed every promise of becoming a valuable and productive contributor to the scientific process and yet I'm not sure what spurred you to it but there is really no place in this enterprise for a rogue physicist.

622
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,000
Anyway, this way?

623
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,220
I can't go this way either.

624
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,380
What is that?

625
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,820
You wanted to grab bodies all game, well now you can.

626
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,280
Yeah!

627
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,420
Trying to move out of here.

628
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,240
Uh...

629
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,100
I can't go this way either, can I?

630
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:12,330
Yeah.

631
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,580
That's not a ladder.

632
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,380
I need to go down?

633
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,520
Kind of spooky down there though.

634
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,620
My gaming PC.

635
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,940
It's okay, we got another one.

636
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,500
This is the newer model.

637
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,320
It still says mmm soup though.

638
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,360
Isn't that so good?

639
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,080
Side passage on the right?

640
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,600
This one?

641
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,800
Left?

642
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:12,800
Oh!

643
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,680
You guys said right.

644
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,700
Someone needs to remember their rights from lives!

645
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,230
I fed the machine!

646
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:37,590
Oh!

647
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,850
Yeah, we like don't want to go in there?

648
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,790
Everybody gets fed to the machine.

649
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,460
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

650
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,080
Right where?

651
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,180
Touch

652
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,080
it.

653
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,140
Just don't touch the center.

654
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,760
Yeah, but what if I get inside and then I start here?

655
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,160
Hold on.

656
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,580
I kind of want to see.

657
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,020
Nice.

658
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:33,560
Ouch!

659
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,300
Oh, I see.

660
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,560
Oh, I was grabbing those on the...

661
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,560
Oh my gosh, that's crazy!

662
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,340
Oh yeah, hold on.

663
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,140
Wait,

664
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,640
if I grab this one...

665
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,840
Ah-ha!

666
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,620
Ah!

667
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,260
Ah!

668
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,560
Ah!

669
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:22,660
Ah!

670
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:22,880
Ah!

671
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,990
My balls can't hurt me?

672
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,630
Still kind of freaks me out, though.

673
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,270
Come here, all of you!

674
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,770
I'll also keep going.

675
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,590
Oh.

676
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,260
My monitor.

677
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,080
Oh.

678
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,120
There he is!

679
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,580
Let's go bullying!

680
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,420
Do they stop eventually?

681
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,620
Maybe.

682
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,870
Wait, I want to get my health back.

683
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,890
This is so awesome.

684
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,510
Nerd!

685
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,490
Waiting for you, Mint, in the test chat.

686
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,330
Oh, I just realized.

687
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:43,810
So they're, like, giving us a little moment of, like, we've struggled so much, and now they're giving us a moment to be, like, invincible main character, like, Sword Art Online.

688
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:50,970
You know?

689
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,370
Giving us our moment.

690
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:08,570
Your mentors are partly to blame, of course, my disappointment in Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner is far greater than my sorrow over your unfortunate choice of career path.

691
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,330
In a way, I suppose you could not have done otherwise.

692
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:26,050
Who knows what seeds of iconoclasm they planted when you were young and gullible, but while they certainly share a great part of the responsibility for the recent troubles, it is to act with such willful disregard for humanity's future.

693
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:29,530
Shut up, Mr.

694
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,910
Just release all the balls!

695
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,510
Release every ball!

696
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,550
Oh, I see that button, though, okay.

697
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,460
I'm invincible, not invincible, but I'm overpowered, but it's still scary.

698
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,160
Ouch,

699
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:58,920
ouch, ouch.

700
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:06,520
I opened something, or I started something, but I'm not sure what I did!

701
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,000
A free mint!

702
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:14,840
Please!

703
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,490
Am I waiting on something?

704
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,230
I hate when they shoot from up there, because I can't...

705
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,450
Maybe I could get them with this.

706
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,130
I was trying to get back to...

707
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:53,290
Heal.

708
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,230
Oh my gosh!

709
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,650
I don't want to be overpowered anymore!

710
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:05,490
I'm scared!

711
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,570
I died.

712
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,190
It's okay.

713
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,530
I just saved... Okay, it just saved outside this.

714
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:13,750
Okay.

715
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,510
Oh my gosh, they don't... Okay, wait, what do I suppose...

716
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:20,230
I press the button and then the red lights flash.

717
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:21,350
Then what?

718
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,990
Right trigger has long range, it does.

719
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:28,450
guys.

720
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,030
They're already coming.

721
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,850
You just wait for the elevator?

722
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:42,870
You just wait it out?

723
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:43,830
Really?

724
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:44,430
That's it?

725
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,070
It's not that long of range.

726
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:52,830
Oh, it's pretty long.

727
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,500
Oh my gosh.

728
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,400
Okay, let's go.

729
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,640
I should have pushed it so that I can wait in a secure location.

730
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,700
Is there a secure location?

731
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,020
I don't even know.

732
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,380
Oh, that's not what I need.

733
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:33,790
Another side of the room, you're so right!

734
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,090
Oh my gosh.

735
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,410
Let's go over there.

736
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,810
Whoa, it's a little more...

737
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:43,110
Oh my gosh, you're right.

738
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,770
I completely forgot about him, though.

739
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:47,090
Come here!

740
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,730
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

741
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:55,770
Oh my gosh!

742
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:58,930
Oh,

743
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:12,840
dang it.

744
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,460
That thing...

745
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,000
It's vaporizing them a little bit, though.

746
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,620
Oh, my gosh.

747
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm gonna save.

748
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:29,960
Ah!

749
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:38,730
Something.

750
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:39,270
Something.

751
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:39,870
Something.

752
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:40,970
Something exploded.

753
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:46,870
Okay.

754
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:47,730
Alright.

755
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:48,570
Bye-bye.

756
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,710
Oh, it's here?

757
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,630
Give it!

758
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,190
Oh,

759
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,020
my god!

760
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:12,610
Where do I hear him?

761
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:13,370
Where are you at?

762
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,390
I hear you.

763
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,090
Holy cow!

764
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:18,950
Craziness!

765
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,990
I should

766
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,700
have, like, used that.

767
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,040
Are you

768
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,440
picking up the same one?

769
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,170
Holy cow.

770
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,390
Holy cow.

771
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,890
We're pulling it back up after I shoot.

772
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,250
I'm not trying to.

773
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:27,890
I'm trying to get like a guy.

774
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,300
Please let this be the top?

775
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:37,760
A little more?

776
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:38,400
Oh.

777
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,320
That's it?

778
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:40,900
Okay.

779
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,060
Oh, we made it, guys.

780
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:59,460
tell me not a thing but if you can you have destroyed so much what is it exactly that you have created can you name even one thing I thought not shut up

781
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,380
oh thank goodness

782
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:14,120
wow gosh even though I I have so much power.

783
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,580
It's tougher than I thought!

784
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,370
She's gonna keep on moving.

785
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,030
Just keep on moving.

786
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,430
Keep moving.

787
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:41,050
Just running.

788
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:42,450
Running along.

789
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:46,850
Just keep on.

790
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:49,310
I have laid the foundation for humanity's survival.

791
01:01:50,250 --> 01:02:04,170
And not as we did earlier, you'll find a- ourselves but as something greater than we could ever imagine something we can now only begin to glimpse huh is

792
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,100
that a strider holy shit

793
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,510
oh that was close

794
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,280
for me major

795
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,930
there we go I don't know how

796
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:21,260
this is a bad idea Oh, no pictures, please!

797
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:32,220
I'm a Bergus fan, I'll follow you until you...

798
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,540
Me too, on the go.

799
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,580
That's me, yeah.

800
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,220
Check keep with Oshi.

801
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,410
Oh, oh, ew.

802
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,110
What are those?

803
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,270
Oh no, another one of my traumas.

804
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,250
No, there's so many of them.

805
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,630
I'm scared of the final boss fight in this game.

806
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,570
Those pictures will be 20 bucks a piece at the end of the ride.

807
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,850
Oh, beta enemies, they were cut from the game.

808
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,390
That was too bad.

809
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,090
Is it gonna drop us, Tower of Terror style?

810
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:33,850
It's beautiful!

811
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,440
This?

812
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,980
It's got nothing on you.

813
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:52,720
Step.

814
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,940
Dark energy.

815
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:57,560
Hello?

816
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,360
This is awkward, huh?

817
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,420
That's mine!

818
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,580
You.

819
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,200
I'll take him from here.

820
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,640
I don't feel...

821
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,260
Don't struggle.

822
01:06:15,280 --> 01:07:21,240
it's no use until you're where he wants you there's nothing you can do I'm sorry Gordon she actually a traitor oh wait this is where we got teleported at the beginning of the game meteorological intelligences worlds stretched thin across the membranes where the dimensions intersect impossible to describe with our limited vocabulary what I've seen is also beyond words green genocide indescribable evil evil god hi well if it isn't gordon freeman at last hello team what's this i'll put it over there what what is this have my gratitude doctor first you lead me straight to the doorstep of my oldest friend then you deliver yourself If I'd known you were going to come straight up to my office,

823
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,960
I wouldn't have bothered hunting you in the first place.

824
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,360
I'm on some Breen machine.

825
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:31,360
Having both of you in my keeping ensures I can dictate the terms of any bargain I care to make with a combine.

826
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,680
Dr. Breen.

827
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,040
Wallace.

828
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:36,900
Yes, Judith.

829
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,020
What is it?

830
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:38,740
Wallace.

831
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,780
The bargain we should be making is for Eli's life so he can continue his research.

832
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,960
Thanks to you, we have everything we need in that regard.

833
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:46,860
No.

834
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,960
You're more than qualified to finish his research yourself.

835
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:50,920
No, oh, he says research.

836
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:57,560
What neither you nor I can't do is convince that rabble in the streets to give up their senseless struggle.

837
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,580
Yet Eli refuses to speak the words that would save them all.

838
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,300
Saved them?

839
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,380
For what?

840
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:12,880
Eli, if you won't do the right thing for the good of all people, maybe you'll do it for one of them.

841
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:15,420
Alex.

842
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:16,340
Daddy!

843
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,000
Gordon?

844
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:19,800
Aye.

845
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,320
No.

846
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,580
God damn you, Green, you let her go!

847
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,860
That's all up to you, my old friend.

848
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:33,520
Will you let your stubborn short-sightedness doom the entire species, or will you give your child the chance her mother never had?

849
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,420
Oh, yeah.

850
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,280
How dare you even mention her?

851
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:41,480
Alex, my dear, you have your mother's eyes but your father's stubborn nature.

852
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,840
You haven't seen a bit of it yet.

853
01:08:45,420 --> 01:09:16,080
see how well it serves you yeah where's barney side of a combine portal go ahead breen if that's the worst you can do send us a vote in the pod well it's hardly the worst but you might find that hard to believe once you get there it isn't necessary i agree it's a total waste fortunately the resistance has shown it is willing to accept a new leader and this one has proven to be a fine pawn for those who control him no don't listen to him gory How about it,

854
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:16,620
Dr. Freeman?

855
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,960
Did you realize your contract was open to the highest bidder?

856
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,860
Gordon would never make any kind of deal with you.

857
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,540
I understand if you don't wish to discuss this in front of your friends.

858
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,940
I'll send them on their way, and then we can talk openly.

859
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,840
Don't struggle on it.

860
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,680
Dad, I'm so sorry, Alex.

861
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,800
No, my friend!

862
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:36,620
Judith?

863
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,360
What did she do?

864
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:38,380
What do you think you're doing?

865
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,400
We're doing what I could never do alone.

866
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,260
We're stopping you.

867
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:42,760
Oh!

868
01:09:44,560 --> 01:10:11,980

869
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,120
Where's my gun?

870
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,340
Where's my gun?

871
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,440
Oh, no, no, just don't worry about me.

872
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,100
There's no time, Alex.

873
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,200
He's on his way to the portal.

874
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:27,920
Hi.

875
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,160
You'll need this.

876
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,080
Dr. Mossman, Judith, look after my father.

877
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:36,640
Don't you worry.

878
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,960
Dad, I'm not saying goodbye.

879
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,340
She's pushing me out of the way.

880
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,480
Come on, Gordon.

881
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:45,780
Let's go.

882
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,180
Are you going to, like, make out what I've got?

883
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,800
I'm not leaving you again, Eli.

884
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,860
We'll give them their space.

885
01:10:59,080 --> 01:10:59,680
We better hurry, Gordon.

886
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,560
Gordon, we haven't known each other very long, but...

887
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,760
Sounds like a yes.

888
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,320
I know you didn't have to do this.

889
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,960
I had to rescue my father.

890
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,120
but you...

891
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,340
Well...

892
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,400
Thanks for coming after me.

893
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,820
You...

894
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,500
Hey, listen.

895
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,460
That's him.

896
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:24,720
Without who?

897
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,160
There's no way I can survive without harm.

898
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,520
A host body must be joking.

899
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:33,360
I can't possibly...

900
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,120
There he is.

901
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,300
Oh, alright, damn it.

902
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,060
That's what it takes.

903
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,060
Just hurry.

904
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,020
He's right behind me.

905
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,360
He's right behind me.

906
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:43,460
happening.

907
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,560
No!

908
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:48,640
Not again!

909
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,470
The gravity gun.

910
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:56,530
Yeah, I got it.

911
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,210
He doesn't have a clue, does he?

912
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:58,870
Nope.

913
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,390
I wonder where he's going.

914
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,690
Doesn't notice what?

915
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:03,830
What am I noticing?

916
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,320
Shoot.

917
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,100
This is the Citadel's dark fusion reactor.

918
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,220
It powers their tunneling entanglement device.

919
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:16,920
Okay.

920
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:23,720
have a chance like this again we've got to stop you see who he's talking to did i miss it

921
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:44,000
i just ran towards him looks like he's turned over control to the other side you'll have to go into the core and do what you can get in the elevator and i'll let you in okay don't forget to charge it what you're saying

922
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:52,340

925
01:13:55,910 --> 01:14:21,900

927
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,560
I don't know what you can possibly hope to achieve apart from your own annihilation

928
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,720
oh I think I'm like doing it right in front of the glass.

929
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:31,340
Okay.

930
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,220
Alright.

931
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,280
I'm making my way.

932
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,280
It's just a little hard to see.

933
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,180
I'm not listening.

934
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,640
I have blood in my ears.

935
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,020
I can't hear anything anymore.

936
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:55,520
I'm dead.

937
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,120
Okay.

938
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:12,400
Okay.

939
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:16,780
Okay, okay.

940
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,280
Alright, we're good, we're good.

941
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:20,420
Good stuff.

942
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:39,720
Great.

943
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:40,940
Great stuff.

944
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,380
Oh no, Green started his ascent.

945
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:44,080
What is this?

946
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,960
Hurry, Gordon, before he escapes.

947
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,880
Um, what do I do?

948
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,500
Do I go in there?

949
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:53,840
With him?

950
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,300
Going up.

951
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,380
So here we go.

952
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,650
Okay, let's see, uh, uh...

953
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:09,790
You

954
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,930
told you that was pointless, Dr. Freeman.

955
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:20,250
Go, Gordon!

956
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,180
I can't see.

957
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:28,340
Um,

958
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:36,120
but...

959
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:36,840
I'm trying!

960
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:37,560
Everybody!

961
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,700
Just a little blind.

962
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:40,800
Oh, here we go.

963
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,500
Let's see it.

964
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,740
Are you still with us, Dr. Freeman?

965
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:45,660
Yes!

966
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,180
Not for much longer, I think.

967
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:47,820
Almost there?

968
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,400
If only you had harnessed your boundless energy.

969
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,180
slow.

970
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,380
Okay, up and see Daisy, please.

971
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,820
Oh my god.

972
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,060
Oh, hi, Alex.

973
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,020
I think I have to take all these out, right?

974
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,300
This is a boss fight.

975
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,320
You're kidding me.

976
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,120
You're kidding me.

977
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,200
Holy cow.

978
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,770
Did I save before this?

979
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:40,730
What the hell?

980
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,150
Where did I last save?

981
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:39,010
Okay, we're fine.

982
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:40,790
That'll be easy to get back up to.

983
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:48,960
I could have told you that was pointless We're okay, we're okay Go, Gordon

984
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:18,240
Are you still with us, Dr. Freeman Not for much longer, I think We got this now, thank you, yeah, now that I know that I don't have to hit the guys I was gonna say, that would be so difficult That would be so crazy Oh my god The portal is opening

985
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,170
I hope you say your farewells.

986
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:33,410
Go back, Freeman.

987
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,100
What did I do?

988
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:42,700
Wait, what did I do?

989
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,780
Wait, what did I do?

990
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,340
Did I fall off the edge?

991
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,200
Did I fall off the

992
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,120
edge?

993
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:12,820
Is it possible?

994
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,440
That's what I was doing before, no?

995
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:19,220
See?

996
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:19,860
Like that.

997
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,040
That's in between the frames.

998
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,500
I hope you said your farewells.

999
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,440
Okay, I need to stop going to the side and see what happens.

1000
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:31,900
Oh my god.

1001
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,760
The portal is opening.

1002
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,880
You can see when it goes through because it goes...

1003
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,880
It goes through.

1004
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,440
Like that, right?

1005
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:41,520
I have no idea what you're doing.

1006
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:43,120
Is that not it going through?

1007
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,080
I hope you said your farewell.

1008
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,640
I was my first time doing this, okay?

1009
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,300
Feel that.

1010
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,060
It's gonna be like that.

1011
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,300
I know it's bouncing off

1012
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:51,140
Found this whole citadel think man think of the people below

1013
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:03,070
Huh The portal is opening

1014
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:14,710
Go back Freeman you have no idea what you're doing I hope you said your farewell.

1015
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:19,190
It's impossible to take out the gunships, but it'd be so, it's so hard like this.

1016
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,070
Yeah, there's no way with the balls.

1017
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:26,470
I mean, not with no way, but you have to be like crazy with...

1018
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,690
I don't like this at all, please!

1019
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,320
One second.

1020
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,560
Wait for them to stop moving and spam balls when it's hard.

1021
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,580
Sorry, people are annoying me.

1022
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,640
You can't hit in the middle.

1023
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:41,780
Okay, okay, okay.

1024
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,460
Go back, Freeman.

1025
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,320
You have no idea what you're doing.

1026
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,240
Just gonna tank it.

1027
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,640
I hope you said your farewells.

1028
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,640
You don't know what you've unleashed.

1029
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,440
You can bring down this old citadel.

1030
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:17,900
man i thought i was hitting it in the middle

1031
01:26:22,540 --> 01:27:45,760
time dr freeman is it really that time again it seems as if you only just derived you've done a great deal in a small time span you've done so well in fact that I've received some interesting offers for your services ordinarily I wouldn't contemplate them but these are extraordinary times rather than offer you the illusion of free choice I will take the liberty of choosing for you if and when your time comes round again I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition dr. Freeman I trust it will like his breathing is reversed the course of well I'm really not at liberty to say in the time this is where i get off oh in front of me it's like the twilight zone

1032
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:39,350
what a boss fight i didn't i didn't think that was the boss fight

1033
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:57,480
now you are with half-life two it's time to start half-life three

1034
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,940
this uh

1035
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:18,390
What?

1036
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:22,950
What?

1037
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:24,310
What?

1038
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:25,550
What?

1039
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:32,130
What?

1040
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:33,410
I'm so...

1041
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,940
How long is episode one?

1042
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,330
Four to six hours.

1043
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:57,910
Okay, okay.

1044
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:58,670
A couple hours.

1045
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:58,950
Okay.

1046
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:05,790
So I was like, oh, I'll just do it today, but like in this stream, but probably a couple hours is real much for me.

1047
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:08,370
What?

1048
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,110
I'm so...

1049
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:24,470
Also, I'm sorry, I didn't realize what you guys were saying when you were like, you can't shoot...

1050
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:25,530
Like, you're shooting the wall.

1051
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:27,270
That's why I was just like, I...

1052
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,670
That's why I thought I was getting it.

1053
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:31,770
I didn't realize that in the middle it was literally like...

1054
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:32,270
Lamar!

1055
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,710
Not working at all.

1056
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:34,950
Oh my gosh!

1057
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:37,030
Where did she get to?

1058
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:57,770
but then you guys help me thank you so thank you so far half life two episode one oh

1059
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:19,290
i can't believe it ended like that and there's no third game i know that there's like so where does episode one and two if if alex is the ending of episode two where does what is Where in the timeline does episode 1 and 2 take place?

1060
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:22,790
Oh!

1061
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:25,370
Right after?

1062
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:27,030
Oh!

1063
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:29,370
Then it's like...

1064
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:34,150
Not a cliffhanger.

1065
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:40,090
Thanks for playing my childhood game.

1066
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:41,390
A winner to you.

1067
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:42,390
A winner is you.

1068
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:43,670
Maybe, surely, potentially.

1069
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:44,810
Yeah!

1070
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:45,810
Thank you.

1071
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:48,470
it was

1072
01:31:54,350 --> 01:32:13,590
a four-year cliffhanger for us I see well then for episode 1 episode 2 and Alex do people really feel like there needs to be a half-life 3 do you still feel like there needs to be

1073
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:25,770
yes okay no spoilers obviously yes or no question without Spoiling, yes.

1074
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:27,430
Oh.

1075
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,140
Play Alex last.

1076
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,420
Yeah, people told me already.

1077
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:36,100
Thank you.

1078
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,940
Special thanks to you, the same as the Walking Dead game.

1079
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,300
They released it by episodes.

1080
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,040
Congrats, and now you know how it feels.

1081
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:52,100
I don't think I know exactly, because I know that there's still a little bit more to continue, but...

1082
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,200
Someone clip that for when she beats episode 2.

1083
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,060
Okay, okay.

1084
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:05,620
You're beginning to understand.

1085
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,100
Yeah, I'm beginning to understand.

1086
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,380
I can't believe that was the ending.

1087
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:16,450
Oh my gosh, I'd love to watch Giver.

1088
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:19,710
I know David Hater's in it.

1089
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:21,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would love to watch Giver.

1090
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:23,270
I don't own it, though.

1091
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:25,330
I don't have it on DVD, so...

1092
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:29,290
I don't want to start episode one.

1093
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:30,250
I think I'm good.

1094
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:33,230
I think I would want to do it all in one stream.

1095
01:33:36,810 --> 01:34:33,490
and then episode let me see hold on a little for Alex because it's a VR I'm kind of nervous about it how long to beat what 12 to 15 hours in VR that's crazy if you're a gamer that strives to see all aspects of the game you are likely to spin around i always i don't go with the like normal length i always go with the gamer length only because i you know i kind of like talk and stuff and i take my time with things usually so 19 hours and vr that's really long for vr i'll try i will try I do want to play it but um

1096
01:34:38,390 --> 01:35:01,070
it's the only VR game that's an actual game and not a tech demo pack up the Dremamine for real also you have to make sure to avoid a game called hunt down the Freeman what I've heard of that before what non what is your name I remember people saying that but I don't remember what it was.

1097
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:04,190
Neck muscle workouts.

1098
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:09,790
That's going to be, I feel like I'm going to be only able to play in like one hour increments.

1099
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:13,110
It'll take a million parts to be.

1100
01:35:17,010 --> 01:35:21,250
I love how everybody is just like, it's awful, don't do it.

1101
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:23,810
And it's legendary, do it.

1102
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:28,810
Do you have VR headset?

1103
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:29,230
I do.

1104
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:33,350
I have the valve index, so I'm all valved out.

1105
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,810
It's probably how they want you to play it.

1106
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:39,230
How did the glasses hold up?

1107
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:41,110
I do have a nose.

1108
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:44,250
Yeah.

1109
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:48,410
It's made for the game.

1110
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,230
I actually thought it would take me a little bit longer to get to the end.

1111
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:08,290
And I guess they were like, we'll give you, after Mega Baby, we'll give you an easy battle.

1112
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:11,110
So excited for me to home out in Aspen.

1113
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:12,350
Thank you!

1114
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:17,290
Yeah, I will be at Holiday Matsuri in Florida this Christmas.

1115
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:19,350
Well, not Christmas.

1116
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,390
It's like, what, the week before Christmas?

1117
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:25,810
Like 19th through 21st?

1118
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,910
Crazy.

1119
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:29,150
As someone who's...

1120
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:30,990
Also motion sick, Alex is worth.

1121
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:31,370
Really?

1122
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:34,290
No, I got your note.

1123
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:35,010
Shut up.

1124
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:36,470
Great job, Ingey.

1125
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:37,190
Episode one is short.

1126
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:40,430
Episode two is longer and Alex splits the different narratively.

1127
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:42,370
But you can't wait.

1128
01:36:42,790 --> 01:36:44,250
But you can screw around a bunch.

1129
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:45,530
I did it in nine hours.

1130
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:47,050
Oh, that's not so bad.

1131
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:54,630
I don't get, I don't intend to get motion sick very much.

1132
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:59,130
I fear for you guys watching more so.

1133
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:13,350
so than me because I feel like I'll be like jerking my head around you know and stuff like that uh so we'll see um yeah we'll see we'll see

1134
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:27,350
uh she's got a jorker we'll see how how it works do those glasses give you those weird nose ear indents because they're so big.

1135
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:31,390
I don't have any, I don't have, they're not even on my face.

1136
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:41,430
Actually, these have been reading glasses the whole time.

1137
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:46,790
There's a mod for Half-Life Alex that makes it much work without VR if the VR sickness is too much.

1138
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:50,170
Oh, don't think about it.

1139
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:54,810
Oh, no.

1140
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:55,970
My glasses.

1141
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:59,130
Oh, there we go.

1142
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:09,550
Um, I, I feel though, um, even though the game ended the way that it did, I still feel very fulfilled.

1143
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:15,730
Because I'm really excited that I've been able to play games that like, here, let me put on some music.

1144
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:20,370
Um, that are like such integral parts of gaming history.

1145
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:27,030
So, it's been really fun to finally experience them.

1146
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:28,830
She's fulfilled!

1147
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:54,530
This one I liked I definitely liked this game more than Half-Life 1 I'd say But Towards the end I was getting so lost Like the part with the Striders I was so lost Like last stream I was super duper lost there It annoyed me But what do I want to put on?

1148
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:55,810
We'll put on this one

1149
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:05,260
It gets intense It really does Because I didn't feel like I had a chance to breathe a lot of the time.

1150
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,920
Because of the story or gameplay?

1151
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,300
Gameplay.

1152
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,860
Actually, I really liked the story of one.

1153
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:24,800
Because you know me, I've mentioned this before, but I really like watching the chaos that comes with an apocalyptic situation.

1154
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:31,760
And so watching Black Mesa kind of get taken over by all the aliens and stuff was really, really fine.

1155
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,680
I really liked that.

1156
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:34,800
The fall.

1157
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:35,880
Yeah, the fall.

1158
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,200
They hired the voice actors based on their looks.

1159
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,840
Eli was literally a homeless guy.

1160
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,060
He sounded so great.

1161
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:46,860
Congrats on beating my favorite game for now, Vito.

1162
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:51,700
One of my favorite aspects of the half-life is how it doesn't use cutscenes and apart from teleporting out of prison.

1163
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:53,560
You never jump time or location.

1164
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,980
Yeah, it's true.

1165
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:02,490
Not voice actors.

1166
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:02,990
The faces.

1167
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:05,190
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

1168
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:06,070
Just his face.

1169
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:07,750
Just the face model.

1170
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:09,410
Did I say, did I say voice actor?

1171
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:10,790
Oh.

1172
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,810
Luxon, you're a little wrong.

1173
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:17,590
You're sorry, you're getting, you're getting, you're getting, um, actual lead in the comments.

1174
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:23,870
Not, not his voice?

1175
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,510
Oh no.

1176
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:28,810
You had the right idea.

1177
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:30,190
Community noted.

1178
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:32,950
Don't cook him.

1179
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:34,790
He had good intentions.

1180
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:41,070
We don't even know the model's name.

1181
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:41,450
What?

1182
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:42,170
That's crazy.

1183
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:43,590
Wait, what's this song?

1184
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:47,570
Oh yeah, I like this song.

1185
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:51,590
I spread misinformation.

1186
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:52,530
No!

1187
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:02,270
Face model was never credited and no one saw or met him since.

1188
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:03,010
Oh my gosh.

1189
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:04,450
Wait, that's so sad though.

1190
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:05,690
I hope he's okay.

1191
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:06,910
I hope the guy's doing alright.

1192
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,340
Have you played Portal 1 and 2?

1193
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:15,280
I have!

1194
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:16,080
Actually!

1195
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,680
I have definitely played Portal 1.

1196
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:26,020
I'm trying to remember if I've played Portal 2.

1197
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:31,560
Thank you for the playthrough.

1198
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,300
I hadn't seen Half-Life games before.

1199
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,000
But I've been really enjoying these.

1200
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:35,860
Question for Science.

1201
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,580
How big do the glasses need to be?

1202
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:40,560
Before you're no longer wearing them and they start wearing you!

1203
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:47,440
I feel like I...

1204
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:47,640
Portal?

1205
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,900
Actually, Portal...

1206
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,900
I feel like I played Portal 2.

1207
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,420
I'm almost positive.

1208
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:55,520
But those were like some of my first like...

1209
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,520
I would say...

1210
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:58,880
Like...

1211
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:05,520
Besides the Sims and like Zoo Tycoon and Roller Coaster Tycoon and like the Simulator type of games.

1212
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:08,320
I think Portal was my first like...

1213
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:09,560
Game.

1214
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:11,400
Game game.

1215
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:12,220
You know?

1216
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:17,980
Portal was my first steam game Yeah, yeah

1217
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:32,300
So I would like to go back And play them I remember really enjoying it

1218
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:41,200
Portal 2 co-op is great fun I have played that one before Yes, yes Yeah

1219
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,900
It would be fun to...

1220
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,320
Especially because it's more puzzle.

1221
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,220
It's more puzzle.

1222
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,520
But I love the turret voices.

1223
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:57,100
They're so cute.

1224
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,340
My first valve was Counter-Strike the OG.

1225
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:01,420
Nice.

1226
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:03,720
Never played the Counter-Strike games.

1227
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:06,560
I never did really FPS anything.

1228
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,240
Until I started streaming.

1229
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:14,100
Does this sound familiar in relation to Portal?

1230
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:15,340
Spice.

1231
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:18,220
If so, you have played Portal 2.

1232
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:30,500
I think of that one thing with what's his name?

1233
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,220
Only place capitalism hasn't touched.

1234
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,400
Space!

1235
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:41,220
Portal Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and TF2 for 20 euro.

1236
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,040
What a time to be alive.

1237
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,640
Have you ever played any of the OG Halo games?

1238
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:48,720
Nope.

1239
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,320
I want to get... Oh, Tim Curry!

1240
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:51,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1241
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,800
Thank you, thank you.

1242
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,480
Yeah, I want to play Halo games, too.

1243
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:01,580
I never was a gamer until I started streaming.

1244
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:05,840
If you are new to me and you're just like, wow, she's so bad at games.

1245
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:07,500
I hope that explains a lot.

1246
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,840
And you might wonder why I got...

1247
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,860
Why I became a gaming streamer?

1248
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:19,420
If I was never a gamer, if I was never...

1249
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,280
If I never played games so much.

1250
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,440
And it's because I've always liked games.

1251
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:25,800
I just never...

1252
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:26,760
I don't know.

1253
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:27,760
I just never played them.

1254
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,080
So...

1255
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:31,580
Hmm.

1256
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:40,860
I think you overwrote Portal Space with Tim Curry.

1257
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:41,740
I did!

1258
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:48,170
Kapian, congrats on joining the Waybray Half-Life 3.

1259
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:52,530
If you get a chance to check out the Games Done Quick Speed Runs for Half-Life 2, they're pretty fun.

1260
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:53,550
Yes!

1261
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:56,850
Also, happy birthday basket Saturday!

1262
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:58,470
Happy, happy birthday!

1263
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:03,630
I'm only good at Ace Combat, other games I'm really bad at.

1264
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,710
Everybody has their thing, that's fine.

1265
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:11,710
Halo Co-op with Doki.

1266
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:14,370
Oh, that would be fun.

1267
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:21,070
But Halo Co- would it be better for me to play Halo?

1268
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:56,750

1269
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:03,010
In case my sarcasm is not being picked up.

1270
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:05,110
Yes, I have played it.

1271
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:08,470
A couple times.

1272
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:12,830
Have you played Metal Gear Solid?

1273
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:13,630
Never.

1274
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:18,410
You're a suit.

1275
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:21,110
E-Tina rolling in her grave.

1276
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:22,350
She's not dead!

1277
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:26,010
Halo Reach with Doki and Matara.

1278
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:35,450
I think Matara has been doing or did a campaign, like a co-op Halo thing, so...

1279
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,750
I don't know if she would want to do it again.

1280
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:42,230
Thank you for the stream today!

1281
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:42,970
Had a rough day.

1282
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,090
Try Princess No!

1283
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:46,670
But your stream really cheered me up and gave me an energy boost.

1284
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:47,730
Thank you for always working hard.

1285
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:48,410
Thank you!

1286
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:49,690
Thank you, thank you.

1287
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:50,990
Yeah, with Bricky.

1288
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:51,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1289
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:52,770
She played all of them already.

1290
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:53,210
Yeah, yeah.

1291
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,190
I thought so.

1292
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:58,430
I thought so.

1293
01:46:59,170 --> 01:46:59,970
Play MGS Minto?

1294
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,950
I'd really like a character that referred to as Revolver Ocelot.

1295
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:05,110
Parentheses, Revolver Ocelot.

1296
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:11,150
I'm trying, someone asked me at Vexpo about Revengeance.

1297
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:13,030
They were like, are you gonna play it?

1298
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:13,890
I was like, of course.

1299
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:16,230
Of course I'm gonna play it.

1300
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:21,570
That's actually my first time replaying it after having played through the mainline series.

1301
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:23,890
So I'm actually going to understand stuff.

1302
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,670
So my reactions will be completely different.

1303
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:29,830
But...

1304
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:33,170
I'm trying to decide when I want to play V.

1305
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:37,230
Trying to decide.

1306
01:47:38,290 --> 01:47:39,950
Because it's such an undertaking.

1307
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:45,750
And I'm like, do I play Revengeance first?

1308
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,730
Before it so I can just get it out of the way?

1309
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:52,930
I played the Sam DLC.

1310
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:54,370
I did not play the Wolf DLC.

1311
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:54,790
it.

1312
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:01,890
Nine years for the meta?

1313
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:04,450
We wait nine years to play V!

1314
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:09,170
I'm sorry it's been nine years.

1315
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:09,670
Buh!

1316
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:10,430
Buh!

1317
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:11,550
Buh!

1318
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:12,570
Buh!

1319
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:12,850
Buh!

1320
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:20,750
Like, tropical floor sometime.

1321
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:22,190
You're into city builders.

1322
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:23,690
Oh, interesting.

1323
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:24,390
I'll check it out.

1324
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:24,950
Thank you.

1325
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,150
Did you play the weird little PSP Metal Gear?

1326
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:30,530
Like Poops and Peace Walker?

1327
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:31,150
I did.

1328
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:32,890
Mm-hmm.

1329
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:37,230
Have you ever played a little indie game called Super Mario?

1330
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:39,150
I think you'd like to play a little indie game called Super Mario.

1331
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:40,190
Do you like Half-Life 2?

1332
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:43,370
Yeah, I gotta try to check that game out.

1333
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:44,650
Don't look behind me.

1334
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:47,630
Asid, I have not played yet.

1335
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,410
Because I'm afraid of...

1336
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:54,890
of card...

1337
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:55,470
gameplay.

1338
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:03,850
Let me play Pokemon X and Y.

1339
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:04,410
I have.

1340
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:06,470
Actually, I still have...

1341
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:08,990
That would be so fun to play.

1342
01:49:09,490 --> 01:49:10,630
Pokemon X and Y.

1343
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:12,410
I still own my copies.

1344
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:18,970
Sometimes I just really crave a Pokemon game, you know what I mean?

1345
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:21,670
Sometimes I...

1346
01:49:21,670 --> 01:49:22,330
There's just...

1347
01:49:22,330 --> 01:49:26,770
I think because, like, when I was a Wii Wisp, I would sit on the toilet.

1348
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:31,890
I wouldn't go to the bathroom, but I would lock myself in the bathroom for, like, hours.

1349
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:36,190
And my mom would be like, Meantong?

1350
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:37,550
Are you okay?

1351
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:41,990
And I'm like, yeah, mom, my tummy hurts because I was just playing Pokemon.

1352
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:43,110
I was not going to the bathroom.

1353
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:56,490
I was locking myself in the bathroom to play Pokemon on my on my game boy And I would use the bathroom I would I would play in the bathroom so no one would bother me for a long time

1354
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:15,330
I say hours in my little baby brain it might have felt like hours It might probably was only like 30 minutes or something, but that's still a long time to be in the bathroom I A little indie game called Fortnite.

1355
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:17,170
It's very small and has snake.

1356
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:18,470
But it's very small.

1357
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:22,770
Oh my gosh, it would be so great to give it some attention, you know.

1358
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,330
Give it a little bit of a boost.

1359
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:30,670
Check out this game called Metal Gear Solid.

1360
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:33,170
I think it's about Metal Gear's and Menkissing.

1361
01:50:42,570 --> 01:50:44,350
Not enough time to play Pokemon.

1362
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:47,370
I was really serious about playing Pokemon.

1363
01:50:50,030 --> 01:51:02,210
from like Christmases when I was like so young and I wouldn't even look up for the camera and all the photos it's me looking down at my game boy

1364
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:35,760
a natural born gamer and then my mom would be like it's a face you'll grow out of Pokemon one day and I think I really that made me angry I was like, don't you put down my interests and my hobbies?

1365
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:38,500
And I took that out of spite, and I became a weeaboo.

1366
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,180
And I

1367
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:46,360
I was like, huh?

1368
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,900
You think I'll grow out of something?

1369
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:52,140
Yeah, I sure showed her.

1370
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:56,200
She can't.

1371
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:59,380
She can't tell me anything now.

1372
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:05,720
I can play Pokemon Pokemon As my job.

1373
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:10,520
Don't forget the Game Boy VR missions where you fight little drones called Wisps.

1374
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:12,460
Wait.

1375
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,640
Um, Metal Gear?

1376
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:20,980
Have you played a game called Stray?

1377
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,700
I have not, actually.

1378
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:25,200
Also, Logan, thank you so much for the five good, then.

1379
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:29,540
Metal Gear?

1380
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,300
But can you Pokemon go to the polls?

1381
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:38,120
Ah, I'm...

1382
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,940
You know, I'm not.

1383
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:42,320
not played Pokemon Go even once.

1384
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:45,120
Because...

1385
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:47,040
Why is everything I do out of spite?

1386
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:51,560
I was living in Japan when it came out, and...

1387
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:53,240
Um...

1388
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:55,680
And it was not available for me.

1389
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,520
And everyone was so into it.

1390
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:00,040
All my friends were so into it.

1391
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,740
And I came back to the States.

1392
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:05,520
And...

1393
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:06,640
Um...

1394
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,620
Everyone was already done with it.

1395
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,500
I was like...

1396
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:14,860
Well, I don't want to play it anymore.

1397
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:17,860
Mati!

1398
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,980
Thank you so much for the 20 gift.

1399
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,800
Your profile picture gets me every time.

1400
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,600
I never thought I would see us a lot.

1401
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:30,380
Mags a lot with Suwako hat.

1402
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:37,900
One thing that stinks about playing Halo nowadays is you won't experience the insane level of community content with new custom game shopping every day.

1403
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,240
So he was like millennial Roblox.

1404
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:48,550
Nobody.

1405
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:49,910
Thank you so much for the five gift.

1406
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:52,030
Oh, hold on.

1407
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:53,250
Let me blow my nose real quick.

1408
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:55,970
I'm still like getting over this stinking cold.

1409
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:12,200
It's allergy season for me.

1410
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:16,380
I wonder if I've if I transitioned from cold to allergies.

1411
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:26,340
If it's allergies and I don't even realize because I thought I was still had a cold.

1412
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:28,360
Could be both.

1413
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:28,820
Maybe.

1414
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:44,720

They're called tiny pretzels They have pumpkin tiny pretzels It's it's they're tiny pretzels and they're covered with like a like a white chocolate.

1421
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:32,370
I think it's white chocolate But this tastes like pumpkins and also has pumpkin seeds on it It's...

1422
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:32,970
Oh my gosh.

1423
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:36,770
Thank goodness they're tiny pretzels because I eat like three at once.

1424
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:40,390
They're so good.

1425
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:43,250
It's so...

1426
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:44,530
It's actually so yummy.

1427
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:48,650

1429
01:55:56,890 --> 01:55:58,330
And healthy?

1430
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:02,250
Hold on, let me go get them.

1431
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:05,470
They're tiny pretzels.

1432
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:08,610
I think a serving size was like...

1433
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:09,450
I don't know, hold on.

1434
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,260
I made a big mistake.

1435
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:45,940
They're not called tiny pretzels.

1436
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:49,200
They're called teeny tiny pretzels.

1437
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:58,500
Trader Joe's pumpkin spiced teeny tiny pretzels.

1438
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:22,040
with oh it's yogurt with yogurt flavored coating and crushed pumpkin spiced pumpkin seeds now does that not sound even are the pick the pictures of them on the bag it says enlarge to show texture because they're so teeny tiny a serving size is 11 pretzels and it's 150 calories

1439
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:30,940
it's fine don't look at the sugars

1440
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,400
Barney and G-Man shared a voice actor.

1441
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:39,020
Oh, wait, they did?

1442
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,200
So talented.

1443
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:44,280
Did you get these on a recommendation?

1444
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,340
No, I just bought them because they looked yummy.

1445
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:48,540
They're my recommendation to you.

1446
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:53,020
If you want to start your fall...

1447
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:54,600
Your fall-ness.

1448
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,280
If you want to be like, wow, it's fall.

1449
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:00,780
Then...

1450
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:01,060
Yeah.

1451
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,580
I trust in your judgment.

1452
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:04,800
I'm going to have one right now.

1453
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:07,940
Teeny tiny pretzel.

1454
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:31,430
Yummy!

1455
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,620
That's it.

1456
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:39,380
I'm convinced.

1457
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,000
Yeah, hashtag not sponsored.

1458
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:45,980
They're my recommendation.

1459
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,100
It's not even like a super pumpkin-y taste.

1460
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:51,200
I think it's like the yogurt's just good.

1461
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,660
Teeny tiny pretzels, that's my recommendation.

1462
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,820
Do you vibe with the Bath and Body Works with all these themes, soaps, and candles?

1463
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:14,700
Actually, I haven't been to Bath and Body Works for stuff like that yet.

1464
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,920
Trader Joe's isn't that close to me.

1465
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:21,080
but you convinced me to make the drive.

1466
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:29,580
There's also, there was like a big, there was like a carrot cake and also like a pumpkin spice cake, but it had like chunky.

1467
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,460
Now I mean chunky, chunky.

1468
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,320
They had chunky frosting.

1469
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:39,580
And not just any type of frosting, it was the cream cheese frosting, the best of the best frosting on top of it.

1470
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:40,420
OYSISIS!

1471
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:48,300
Yeah, I have a friend who I'm gonna be meeting up with.

1472
01:59:48,940 --> 02:00:06,800
that they don't have pumpkin stuff in her country so I'm gonna bring her everything so I've been buying a lot of pumpkin stuff so I can like give it to her I'm like okay I'll try this oh it's good okay now I'm gonna give it to my friend

1473
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:24,180
bring her a pumpkin oh my gosh you're so right no I thought about bringing the pumpkin the pumpkin pie I want to bring a pumpkin pie for her.

1474
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,300
I think I will.

1475
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:30,420
I don't think, though, whipped cream will go well.

1476
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:33,340
Like, I don't think it'll last.

1477
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,400
Can you bring a whole ass pumpkin on a flight?

1478
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:46,240
Probably not, actually.

1479
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:49,380
Because they don't allow, like, vegetables.

1480
02:00:51,580 --> 02:01:07,720
But you can bring food it's gonna consume so much pumpkin that she'll have a pumpkin head that's what my dad would call me pumpkin head my head is my

1481
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:19,210
head is not so gorgeller do you think I have a pumpkin head if

1482
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:26,570
you wear it on your head it's a piece of clothing so true

1483
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:31,760
Yeah, like a gourd.

1484
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:33,640
But gourdular.

1485
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:39,980
Honestly, yeah, you're very pumpkin-headed.

1486
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:43,640
Duh!

1487
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:51,280
Is it the stem, my ahoye?

1488
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,100
I thought I had orange.

1489
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,540
That I could change my hair to.

1490
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:01,140
I could.

1491
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:02,120
Hold on.

1492
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:09,870
Wait, let's see if this works.

1493
02:02:12,130 --> 02:02:12,750
Let's see if this works.

1494
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:21,230

1498
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:16,100
I like this one a lot too.

1499
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:23,620
Miku, Miku, Uigu.

1500
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,560
You guys know this one?

1501
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:31,100
But it can go a little darker.

1502
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:33,400
A little more gothy.

1503
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:35,560
This is like a...

1504
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:37,860
This is like a...

1505
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:40,300
Characters in... what's it called?

1506
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:44,100
I wonder if my hair, if it's long, if it works too.

1507
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:55,910
Hex maniac.

1508
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:03,290
I like this one too, it feels so natural.

1509
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:04,970
Feels like I could be human.

1510
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:12,260
A little darker.

1511
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:14,760
And then...

1512
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:15,020
Kuro!

1513
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:19,760
Black hair.

1514
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:22,940
Chokomi!

1515
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:24,780
Yeah, oh wait, you're right.

1516
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:26,320
This is quite...

1517
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:28,420
White chocolate mint, huh?

1518
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:30,000
Oh, get rid of that.

1519
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:34,450
It kind of matches.

1520
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:37,490
Kind of matches.

1521
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:43,030
Brownie minto!

1522
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:47,810
I can change my eyes too.

1523
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,640
To red.

1524
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:59,600
Wait, red on red?

1525
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,080
It's like pink.

1526
02:05:15,190 --> 02:05:16,310
Okay, I'm done.

1527
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:30,860
I feel like you guys like every variation but me.

1528
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:36,280
You like every variation but the original.

1529
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:40,200
No, no.

1530
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,000
We like them all.

1531
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:48,780
Yeah.

1532
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:50,740
Like the original flavor.

1533
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,740
You're not just saying that?

1534
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:01,240
You're not just saying that!

1535
02:06:06,330 --> 02:06:08,170
It's her strawberry short mint.

1536
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,700
Mint is my favorite ice cream.

1537
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:14,700
Mint floor.

1538
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:16,680
She's a chameleon the whole time.

1539
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:25,540
I like the original the best, but if we didn't shut up about it, we would never have actual combos.

1540
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:26,040
No!

1541
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:27,740
This is not true.

1542
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,740
Well, guys, this was quite the short stream.

1543
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:34,300
So short.

1544
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:42,040
But, wait, I don't think I've kept up with my games that I've beat this year.

1545
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:43,640
One second.

1546
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:45,540
Oh.

1547
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:49,690
Oh.

1548
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:51,450
I have a list.

1549
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:52,990
Let's see.

1550
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:54,070
Completed the games.

1551
02:07:00,910 --> 02:07:01,490
Kept up with it.

1552
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:03,690
Let me go to my channel and make sure I didn't forget any.

1553
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:06,450
Oh, let's see.

1554
02:07:06,590 --> 02:07:06,990
Let's see.

1555
02:07:07,090 --> 02:07:08,650
I ended it on...

1556
02:07:08,650 --> 02:07:09,470
It's loading still.

1557
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:10,430
It's kind of slow.

1558
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:16,550
I

1559
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:24,510
ended it with Devil May Cry back in May.

1560
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:28,910
So let's see.

1561
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:30,850
Back in Devil May Cry.

1562
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:32,550
Devil May Cry.

1563
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:33,570
Devil May Cry.

1564
02:07:34,470 --> 02:07:34,850
Oh jeez.

1565
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:35,810
Okay, Devil May Cry.

1566
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:37,770
I did.

1567
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:40,210
Let's see.

1568
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:41,750
Uh oh.

1569
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:43,870
Emissary Zero?

1570
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:49,110
I did Emissary Zero?

1571
02:07:51,050 --> 02:07:52,730
I did Duck Detective?

1572
02:07:57,080 --> 02:08:00,300
I did Blade Runner?

1573
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:04,400
I did...

1574
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,140
Yeah, RE6?

1575
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:05,940
I'm going in order.

1576
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:09,580
Kirby's Dreamland?

1577
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:13,120
I did...

1578
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:13,500
Oh, wow.

1579
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,500
Okay, more than I thought.

1580
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:15,220
Yippee!

1581
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,440
I'm Jurassic Park Arcade.

1582
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:18,640
Can I count that?

1583
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:21,840
Oblivion?

1584
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,480
No, these are only games I've completed.

1585
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:26,940
Nancy Drew, I think she's already on the list.

1586
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,100
Yeah, she's already on the list.

1587
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:30,020
Yeah, let's go.

1588
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:31,320
Jurassic Park Arcade.

1589
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:38,440
Um...

1590
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:39,560
Lone Shark?

1591
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:40,900
I guess...

1592
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:42,980
I did... That was another game that I did complete.

1593
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:45,120
Um...

1594
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,960
Resident Evil 6?

1595
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:54,660
Oh, that's...

1596
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:03,100
And now I'm completing two more this week.

1597
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:06,120
But Half-Life 2!

1598
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:10,160
Half-Life 2 puts me at 25 games!

1599
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:12,520
Uh-oh.

1600
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,220
I'm only halfway!

1601
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:17,760
And it's already September!

1602
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:20,880
Peak probably counts, right?

1603
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:21,400
Nah.

1604
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:26,100
25 games in 2025.

1605
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:31,120
But I want to get to 50.

1606
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:38,960
25 is still a lot though, is it?

1607
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:41,580
And then

1608
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:48,000
we'll be completing Delta.

1609
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:52,520
And I'll also be completing The Walking Dead so we can add those soon.

1610
02:09:58,530 --> 02:09:59,250
More than me.

1611
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:01,810
I mean, I play games every day almost.

1612
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:04,150
So it makes sense that I'm beating them.

1613
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:04,730
Hopefully.

1614
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:13,760
You want to get to 50?

1615
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:14,520
That's a challenge.

1616
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:15,120
I know.

1617
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:18,900
One game every week.

1618
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:22,340
I have to start or stop playing dummy games.

1619
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:25,220
Well, I guess Waterpark Simulator is technically.

1620
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:28,660
You could beat it once you get to 50 or 5 stars.

1621
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:33,660
But I got to stop playing dummy games.

1622
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:37,880
Add all the YouTube playables to boost your numbers.

1623
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,480
Right!

1624
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,580
I was thinking that, not gonna lie.

1625
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:53,340
Like, I've played simulator games.

1626
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:55,400
Like, I've played more than 50 games.

1627
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:58,780
Or not more than 50, but I've, like, you know, like I've played...

1628
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:00,900
Like, uh...

1629
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:02,560
Like, Peak, and...

1630
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:07,200
Pixel Museum, and Oblivion, and played a lot of stuff.

1631
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:09,240
Planet Zoo.

1632
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:13,160
But, beating them is...

1633
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:16,200
Some of these games are not beatable, So...

1634
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:16,600
Ah.

1635
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:21,400
Yeah, gotcha games can't really be beaten either, exactly.

1636
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:27,490
I didn't beat Peek, though.

1637
02:11:28,530 --> 02:11:29,590
We were carried.

1638
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:31,730
I don't... I'm not gonna count it.

1639
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:40,020
You beat gotcha games and you stop playing them.

1640
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:41,160
So true.

1641
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:45,300
So true.

1642
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:53,730
I beat taxes.

1643
02:11:53,870 --> 02:11:54,490
What's that mean?

1644
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:02,060
You could have been in Minecraft and added to the list.

1645
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,020
What do you mean, could have?

1646
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:09,660
Thank you so much for the gift, thank you.

1647
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:11,220
I want to say your name.

1648
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:12,280
Gillum.

1649
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:13,740
Gillum.

1650
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:14,440
Gillum.

1651
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,360
I'm so sorry.

1652
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,640
Thank you so much, though.

1653
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:19,640
Does that mean you stop playing BA?

1654
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:20,460
No.

1655
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:23,180
I'm still playing Blue Archive every day.

1656
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,300
Can you beat gotcha if you pull everything?

1657
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:31,820
every single character in the game, that's when I've beaten the game.

1658
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:35,820
Minito, can you complete my life?

1659
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:40,920
What did you mean by this?

1660
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:48,040
Shippogaki kept a global and a win?

1661
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:49,060
It was a few weeks?

1662
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:52,720
In a few weeks.

1663
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:56,280
Yeah.

1664
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:02,160
I'll have to think of some other games that we can like...

1665
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:07,400
Should we count Half-Life Episode 1 and 2 as their own games?

1666
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:10,000
Hmm, can we cheat the system a little bit?

1667
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:13,640
But we'll think of some more games that...

1668
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,620
I want to...

1669
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:23,740
I want to really play some more, like, you know, influential games, like, older games.

1670
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:27,200
I'm really into my, like, retro games slash...

1671
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,140
Oh my gosh, you guys!

1672
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,160
And you know how I'm into...

1673
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:31,240
I'm on my zombie kick lately?

1674
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,380
It's actually a web tune that I started reading.

1675
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:35,080
Oh, whoops.

1676
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:44,840
It's by a author that I liked a previous series that they did.

1677
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:49,740
And it's called Paradise on Earth.

1678
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:55,780
And it's about like a group that goes on one of those types of like Love Island type shows.

1679
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:57,640
But then a zombie outbreak happens.

1680
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,500
So far I'm liking it.

1681
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:07,660
And so I'm like, and I was reading it yesterday, and I was like, oh my gosh, wait, this is zombies.

1682
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:10,420
Why am I all about zombies lately?

1683
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:15,080
Why am I all about zombies lately?

1684
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:17,620
Can you say the name again?

1685
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:20,200
Yeah, it's a paradise on earth.

1686
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:23,940
It's pretty fun so far.

1687
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:24,900
It's interesting.

1688
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:33,240
Struck by the zombie craze.

1689
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:34,500
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1690
02:14:39,480 --> 02:15:11,730
media how about rogue the game that all the games are like oh the roguelike i know i suggested after beat blade runner it would be awesome if you played mystery of the druids that would be fun let me write some of these down so i can remember so far i have a small little list it has deadly premonition and near on it but then what else there was one of the thing um the

1691
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:47,100
game that's not doom uh what's the one that's not doom what do they call mint with glasses reading a zombie novel a zombie quake yeah yeah i want to play quake thank you quake quake quake there are a few but there's one that i was thinking of most people knew what I was talking about.

1692
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:48,660
Yeah.

1693
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:52,880
Hmm.

1694
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:58,640
So, didn't you play Typing of the Dead?

1695
02:15:58,780 --> 02:15:59,120
I have!

1696
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:01,020
I streamed it!

1697
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:03,060
Sonic CD.

1698
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:05,660
Sonic CD.

1699
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:07,400
I think Sonic games would be good.

1700
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:11,060
I have a lot of friends.

1701
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:11,900
Or not a lot of friends.

1702
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:12,080
Sorry.

1703
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:12,820
Why did I say that?

1704
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,280
I have a friend.

1705
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:16,600
I was trying to say she's a lot into Sonic.

1706
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,360
She's super duper into Sonic.

1707
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:20,400
So I would like to...

1708
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:22,780
Do more Sonic.

1709
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:26,080
So that I can talk to her more about it.

1710
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:27,820
Stream the new Silent Hill.

1711
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:29,900
Yeah.

1712
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:31,820
Wait, when does that come out?

1713
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:32,940
It had a date, no?

1714
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:36,480
Silent Hill.

1715
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:43,570
September 25th?

1716
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:46,650
That's the end of the month!

1717
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:47,650
Oh my gosh!

1718
02:16:49,890 --> 02:16:51,370
Wait, wait, let me write that down.

1719
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:54,190
Let me put that in my calendar.

1720
02:16:55,930 --> 02:17:25,890
September 25th Silent Hill F Just in time for Spooky Mind I'm here to chill for Mass Effect Honestly though As much as it hurts to call me Mass Effect Retro I remember saying I wanted to play Mass Effect and people were saying not to for some reason and I can't remember why.

1721
02:17:27,810 --> 02:17:29,890
Maybe because it's, like, really long.

1722
02:17:31,470 --> 02:17:33,450
Even though I do really want to play it.

1723
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:38,880
It's a mixed bag.

1724
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:41,500
Deus Ex?

1725
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:43,580

1726
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:53,730

CUE!

1739
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:58,240
Saw you, I have expo too, but I was too anxious to say hi.

1740
02:19:58,900 --> 02:19:59,720
I don't bite.

1741
02:20:03,970 --> 02:20:08,890
Though I will say, I'm glad I took off Sunday yesterday to not stream.

1742
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:15,050
Usually with cons, what makes it really difficult, especially if you're on the little tablet.

1743
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:24,410
So for those who don't know, I was at Vexpo, a convention, a VTuber convention this past weekend.

1744
02:20:24,930 --> 02:20:31,790
And I did two surprise meet and greets, which was where I went around the maid cafe that I was having a collab with.

1745
02:20:33,970 --> 02:21:05,710
meet and greet but um the actual meet and greet was fine because the people talking to me had a mic but when it's on like the tablets oh my gosh it's so difficult because i'm screaming the entire time when i'm talking to everybody and i get so excited that i start like and i can't help it but then if i'm like if i am you know going around and talking to people for a whole hour i'm like for like a whole hour straight.

1746
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:19,730
And so my voice by the end of it is always just like, and then also I'm having to talk even louder because on the tablet, they can't always hear me if the convention is really loud.

1747
02:21:22,650 --> 02:21:53,130
So, just to kind of give you guys a little bit of insight of like how it can be, um it can be like i love and i love meeting everybody but by the end my social battery is and i am tired and i've been yelling how many marriage proposals just one well two one was a marriage proposal and the second one was asking me to marry someone else

1748
02:21:57,130 --> 02:22:34,170
uh so that's why i took office i didn't want to but i was like ah i've been yelling at everybody people for two days so i think i will i just get so excited to meet everybody i love it so much get so excited and someone will be like hi i'm so and so and i like recognize the name and i'm like so and so so so i got some meeting of like two i think you'd like the first day of sex if metal gear solid had a regular weekend drinking buddy it would be like a No way!

1749
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:38,390
Greetings, mid-Mint from VTuberTM.

1750
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:40,630
Congrats on your 27th game.

1751
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:41,350
Wait, 27th?

25th?

1753
02:22:43,870 --> 02:22:45,030
Consider playing Fallout.

1754
02:22:45,210 --> 02:22:45,790
Oh my gosh!

1755
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:47,310
I want to play Fallout too.

1756
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:50,030
Fallout's kind of long though, yeah.

1757
02:22:53,650 --> 02:22:54,950
Yeah, it's so-and-so!

1758
02:22:55,210 --> 02:22:56,170
Oh my gosh, so-and-so!

1759
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:57,610
Thank you so much for the support!

1760
02:22:59,230 --> 02:23:02,810
One day we'll move on from VTubers and Tablets to VTubers Piloting Metal Gears.

1761
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:04,730
Yeah, just comment.

1762
02:23:05,230 --> 02:23:05,630
Omipas.

1763
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:13,130
Ugh, my nose is getting worse.

1764
02:23:13,790 --> 02:23:15,330
Okay, I'm gonna call it here then, folks.

1765
02:23:16,030 --> 02:23:17,410
Thanks for letting me out for a little bit.

1766
02:23:17,570 --> 02:23:20,990
I don't wanna just end the stream after we beat it so quickly.

1767
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:24,770
But thank you, guys!

1768
02:23:25,170 --> 02:23:26,810
Thank you for Half-Life!

1769
02:23:27,170 --> 02:23:28,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1770
02:23:28,810 --> 02:23:29,470
Fake day!

1771
02:23:29,610 --> 02:23:30,490
Thank you so much for that!

1772
02:23:30,710 --> 02:23:31,590
Akasufo, thank you.

1773
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:34,550
Congrats on beating Half-Life 2, certified gamer Minto.

1774
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:36,550
I feel like I had some real gamer moments.

1775
02:23:37,850 --> 02:23:38,890
this time around.

1776
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:41,510
And some really brain-empty moments.

1777
02:23:41,710 --> 02:23:42,150
I apologize.

1778
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:44,690
I have to balance it.

1779
02:23:47,050 --> 02:23:48,190
This game, though.

1780
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:49,810
This game...

1781
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:51,750
I feel like I had some pretty good moments.

1782
02:23:53,690 --> 02:23:55,370
Ah well, thank you so much for the fight, get this!

1783
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:58,770
I think I missed the live finale, but thank you again for playing an old favorite.

1784
02:23:58,850 --> 02:23:59,850
Thank you, Nappos!

1785
02:24:00,430 --> 02:24:01,210
Napp, Napp.

1786
02:24:01,930 --> 02:24:03,630
Napp the moi and glasses look.

1787
02:24:03,970 --> 02:24:05,110
You're gonna play any Persona.

1788
02:24:07,310 --> 02:24:09,050
Persona I'm not really a...

1789
02:24:09,050 --> 02:24:13,950
Well, I am a JRPG player, but I am not really a JRPG streamer, unfortunately.

1790
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:16,330
But never say never.

1791
02:24:17,890 --> 02:24:19,630
It was nice to meet you for a second time.

1792
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:19,970
Yeah!

1793
02:24:20,630 --> 02:24:21,430
Thank you, Miko.

1794
02:24:22,690 --> 02:24:24,130
Already planning to see you at home, Matt.

1795
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:25,190
Oh, thank you!

1796
02:24:25,450 --> 02:24:25,970
Let's go!

1797
02:24:28,410 --> 02:24:29,870
Half-Life 2, Minto, and Yapping.

1798
02:24:30,130 --> 02:24:31,150
I love the series so much.

1799
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:32,190
It's been a blast watching you.

1800
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:33,490
Thank you, thank you, Miko!

1801
02:24:37,210 --> 02:24:37,830
Persona is very...

1802
02:24:37,850 --> 02:24:55,270
long jrpgs very long very long p5 20 minute game trust yeah we'd love to but you know

1803
02:25:00,290 --> 02:25:15,730
i think you'd like no more heroes really persona's turn base too which you aren't a huge fan of true true true true true true yeah not really a huge fan of Turnbase.

1804
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:17,450
Like, it depends on the Turnbase.

1805
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:30,220
Suda is crazy studio.

1806
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:32,420
Maddie, Maddie worked there.

1807
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:35,480
Nice to meet you!

1808
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:37,340
I'm watching the stream from Japan.

1809
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:38,280
Your voice is so cute.

1810
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:39,700
I fell in love with you at first sight.

1811
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:41,400
Moe Moe Q was also good.

1812
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,420

Umu, umu.

1817
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:57,420
Japanese.

1818
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,300
Main character of no more heroes is Kaizen Otaku.

1819
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:11,740
Yeah, it's same as Robert Ackendowns, no?

1820
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:16,160
I've been speaking more Japanese lately, have I?

1821
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:19,240
I think just because some people have been typing in chat.

1822
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:22,200
If they type in Japanese.

1823
02:26:27,070 --> 02:26:28,470
I need to practice more.

1824
02:26:29,870 --> 02:26:31,850
I forget so much all the time.

1825
02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:34,830
