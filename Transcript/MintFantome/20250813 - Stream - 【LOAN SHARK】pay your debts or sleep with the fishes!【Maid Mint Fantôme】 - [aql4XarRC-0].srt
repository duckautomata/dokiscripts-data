1
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,390
Howdy, y'all!

2
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,340
Howdy, howdy!

3
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,060
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

4
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,700
Hello, everybody!

5
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,580
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

6
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,100
Today I'm purple.

7
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,420
Today...

8
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Today I decided to be purple.

9
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,660
I'm purple today.

10
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,120
Howdy.

11
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,840
Oh, princess.

12
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,980
Oh, princess.

13
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,620
Oh, my gosh.

14
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:35,300
If I ever have an ojo-sama that I could call princess, I would say it.

15
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,320
I would go to her and be like, oh, princess.

16
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,940
Oh, princess.

17
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,660
Why is she Orpil?

18
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,140
Because...

19
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,260
Because the thumbnail!

20
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,860
Who are you?

21
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,300
Aminto!

22
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,280
It's my birthday and Taco Tuesday!

23
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,160
Toxtrinx!

24
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,960
Happy birthday!

25
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,780
I love my cringe-o-she.

26
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,320
I think I was thinking so much for that tiny gift.

27
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,160
Thank you!

28
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,260
Does this mean we have purple doki?

29
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,260
This is not her...

30
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,660
This is not about her.

31
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,000
Read the rules.

32
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,040
Do not mention other streamers.

33
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,180
Unless I bring them up first.

34
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,580
Gosh, I don't know.

35
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,460
Ask her.

36
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,120
If you want purple dokey, you're asking the wrong gal.

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,780
I volunteer for the role of poinsers.

38
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,300
Oh, poinsers.

39
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,060
Princess.

40
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,080
Princess, it's me, your maid.

41
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,200
It's time to wake up, Princess.

42
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,620
Princess, may I brush your hair?

43
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,320
Hmm.

44
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,100
Princess, let me help you change out of your nightgown, Princess.

45
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,220
Princess, it's time to bathe.

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Princess, let me...

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240
Let me...

48
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,220
Let me, let me scrub your back for you, princess.

49
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,920
Don't even whiff your little delicate finger.

50
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,940
What the heck is going on?

51
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,920
Don't worry, that's me.

52
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
If I, okay, so I'm a maid cafe maid, right?

53
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,520
But this is if I were to be like a maid in like a real mansion.

54
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,340
Jell!

55
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,780
Mint is a.

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:58,560

57
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:18,500
bustin pride turtles did you know my kamiyoshi is debuting a new alpha in less than a week she's also almost at 400k subs actually guys i have a confession to make It's pretty good that I didn't make it to 400k.

58
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,160
Because...

59
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,400
Eh, sooner, I mean.

60
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,900
Because...

61
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,380
Actually, the cover isn't done yet.

62
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,150
The video is not done yet.

63
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,010
I was just being like, Oh, maybe I could get there.

64
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,070
Maybe...

65
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,610
It'll incentivize people...

66
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,690
But the video's not done.

67
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,850
It'll be done next week.

68
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,730
And hopefully I reach 400k by then.

69
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,870
So...

70
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,710
Hopefully I reach it by then.

71
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,490
And then we will...

72
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,130
I will...

73
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,610
I'll upload it.

74
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,760
That time Minto overestimated herself.

75
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,200
We gotta unsub.

76
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,060
What do you mean?

77
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,620
Overestimate.

78
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,060
You're just too good.

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,820
What do you mean?

80
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
So you were lying to us.

81
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,320
No!

82
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,720
It'll come out when I hit 400k.

83
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,820
It might be just a few days later.

84
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,720
It might just be a little later.

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,960
Then you...

86
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Imagine if I had hit 400k last week.

87
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,900
You would have had to wait two weeks.

88
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,510
You would have had to unsubscribe.

89
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,810
No, no, no.

90
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,010
Don't unsubscribe.

91
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,610
401k special.

92
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,030
My birthday is Thursday.

93
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,310
I don't know if I could catch stream.

94
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,150
Yeah, actually.

95
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,730
Well, Thursday is also a collab, so it would be hard for me to say happy birthday anyway.

96
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,470
JT, happy birthday.

97
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,750
Just play this on Thursday.

98
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,130
Happy 399k subs.

99
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,090
It's somewhat of a special.

100
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,370
Yeah, Eggie.

101
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,770
Get the boarder kid down so he can be scabbed.

102
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,850
That's my middle name, baby.

103
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,790
Mint scam phantom.

104
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,910
Mint scab tub.

105
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,810
Mint scab tub.

106
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,000
Mint scab tub.

107
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

108
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,620
Common color swap skin minto.

109
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,480
Did you guys see I'm a Uma Musume?

110
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,980
Also, oh my gosh, thank you guys so much for all the super chats.

111
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,960
You never promised an instantaneous release so far.

112
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,680
That's true.

113
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,960
That's so true.

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,840
The hair looks good in that color.

115
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,860
Thank you.

116
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,080
What if we all unsub till it's out?

117
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,420
No!

118
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,060
She's gaslighting.

119
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,580
us.

120
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,980
Donating to the 400k fund.

121
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,360
Is this like my 401k?

122
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,400
I don't need that anymore though.

123
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm dead.

124
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,400
Umaminto!

125
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,340
Yeah!

126
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,540
Did you see?

127
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,260
Uh, what was the worst statement?

128
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,760
Hold on.

129
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
What was it?

130
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,540
Was it mint of the maid or maid of the mint?

131
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,060
I can't remember.

132
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,160
made of the mint

133
00:10:06,840 --> 00:11:00,380
made of the mint is a horse I saw people being like I posted this on Twitter in case you're just like I don't know what you're talking about posted a screenshot Snuffy sent me a DM she was just like she slid into my DMs sneaky raccoon she slid into my DMs and she was just like meito look at this thing I discovered while searching horses and it was a horse from 1897 named made of the mint that horse is dead and I saw some people being like ah it's dead oh no and I'm like yeah but that's that's literally me I'm dead too tomorrow I plan on plopping the big question to my special someone Can I get your blessing?

134
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
Now what time is your next dream so I can mentally prepare myself?

135
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,200
Wait, huh?

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,780
What do you mean?

137
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,440
Wait, do you want me to give you the blessing now or next dream?

138
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Why the long face?

139
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,860
Wait, I'm confused by the timing.

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,700
You need it now?

141
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,420
Did I say plopping?

142
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,880
Oh, it does say popping.

143
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,320
I was like, oh, we're plopping the question.

144
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,360
We're just like a chunk of meat on the table.

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,720
I thought for real.

146
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,320
I thought that's what she meant because it was a heavy question.

147
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,440
And you're plopping

148
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,590
it on the table.

149
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,470
You get it!

150
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,170
Do you understand my vision?

151
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,750
Jesus.

152
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,430
Sorry.

153
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,530
I'm crying.

154
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,310
Okay, anyway.

155
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,130
Anyway.

156
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,710
What was I saying?

157
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,270
I don't remember anymore.

158
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,970
Horse confirmed.

159
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,870
Oyse Ningen.

160
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,430
Send me that shit, Murphy.

161
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,150
What the hell?

162
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,020
Good bit.

163
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,640
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,500
Yeah, it was a good bit, right, everybody?

165
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,380
I said you're...

166
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,740
Yeah, you said I'm a dead horse.

167
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,600
Continuing with this bit would be beating a dead horse.

168
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,510
You love it.

169
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,570
You love it.

170
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,660
Ooh, glue factory.

171
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,900
Then you could eat me.

172
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
Turn me to glue!

173
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,660
Turn me to glue!

174
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,220
I will be consumed by some curious child.

175
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,940
Some child that is in probably...

176
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,380
What grade did you guys eat glue?

177
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,160
What grade did you guys eat glue?

178
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,560
Sashimi?

179
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,800
No, I'm too thin.

180
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,340
I don't have enough, I don't have enough fat on me.

181
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,540
I'm too skinny.

182
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,300
You never did?

183
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,340
Really?

184
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,340
I saw an episode of the Powerpuff Girls and the kid ate glue, but they made fun of him for it.

185
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,320
But I also thought, well, it looks, the kid just makes it look so appetizing.

186
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,040
I never stopped.

187
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,790
I just kind of want to try it.

188
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,230
We all ate glue, right?

189
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,390
We all, we all...

190
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,110
Let's make a song out of it.

191
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,170
I ate glue.

192
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,110
And so did you.

193
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,470
We all ate glue.

194
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,630
Yes, that's so true.

195
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,990
Glue plus crayons is our face.

196
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,990
What does a huffing glue do?

197
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,350
How do you huff the glue?

198
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,250
You sniff the glue?

199
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,690
It smells fine.

200
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,910
For you I'll eat glue.

201
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:31,590
Ah!

202
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,250
Don't do that!

203
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,310
Oh really?

204
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,690
Huffing glue gets you...

205
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,310
Wait, really?

206
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,910
What if we all start a glue-eating party?

207
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,850
I see a lot of people that have never eaten glue before.

208
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,350
Depends on the glue.

209
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,670
I...

210
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,550
I...

211
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,010
I was about to say I ate.

212
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,810
I only use non-toxic glue.

213
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,250
What does your glue smell like?

214
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,930
It smelled like...

215
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,430
It smelled like...

216
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,690
Glue has a very specific smell, no?

217
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,390
Do not huff or eat glue.

218
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,370
Yeah, everybody, let's not eat glue.

219
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,230
We're apparently huff the glue.

220
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,430
Don't sniff glue.

221
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,230
This is your PSA.

222
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,450
It's like those PSAs when you're a kid, they're just like...

223
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,970
They're like, cigarettes are bad.

224
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,690
Getting...

225
00:16:40,430 --> 00:17:11,770
the 400k today so we can cancel her for not having to cover out when you hit 400k you won't give me the 400k today you won't do it you can't give me the 400k if I delete my channel haha jokes on you get caught aren't horses in Japan more likely to become sashimi Perhaps.

226
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,450
Well, I got you.

227
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,230
Would you, would it be better to sniff glue or gas?

228
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,390
Oh, I like the smell.

229
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:32,070
I, oh my gosh, I love going into like home, like a, what's it called?

230
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:39,390
Like a, the store is where you get all the wood and the plants.

231
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,190
Um, like the renovation store.

232
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,410
Like a Home Depot?

233
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,850
Yeah, a hardware store!

234
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,710
A hardware store!

235
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,330
I was trying to think of more vague.

236
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,570
Home Depot is a specific place.

237
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,470
Logan, thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

238
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,010
Bye.

239
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,250
Um, yeah, the Home Improvement stores.

240
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,790
I like going to those places.

241
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,470
They smell so good.

242
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,410
You guys think that too?

243
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,350
It smells good.

244
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,750
I love that smell.

245
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,030
Yeah, the weird owl song.

246
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,410
Wait, what do you mean?

247
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,230
There's a weird owl song about it.

248
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:33,250
It's like such a specific smell, like about, like it's like also the wood and all, I guess, the rubber and...

249
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,450
Hardware store!

250
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,150
Wait, I want to listen to it.

251
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,710
Can I, real quick?

252
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,750
If you want a really good smell, open the bags inside a new Lego set and smell that.

253
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:45,770
Really?

254
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,250
Oh, I've been really wanting a new, um, there was a Lego set I saw that I really thought about getting.

255
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,970
Oh, I remember what it was.

256
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,930
It was, um, it was a, like, a little gotcha.

257
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,670
Hold on.

258
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,930
I can't make the, the game shut up, so I'm just, but I'm gonna listen to this song.

259
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,330
Weird Al Hardware Store.

260
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,210
And I bought Tyson's house!

261
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,770
Thank you so much for five years and thank you!

262
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,910
a hardware store.

263
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,330
Oh my gosh, if I search it, weird out comes up.

264
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,690
Is there a music?

265
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,810
Oh, there is a music video.

266
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,050
Okay.

267
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,350
Sorry, I have to turn it off for you guys.

268
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,650
You actually...

269
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,410
Will I get...

270
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,070
You don't think I'll get caught.

271
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,190
Well, actually, I get caught all the time.

272
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,630
Who cares if it's...

273
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,850
I get caught.

274
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,690
Like, so many of my streams are demonetized.

275
00:19:44,510 --> 00:20:12,230
Obviously, the door knows that's your money is not going to to the ether but you know i don't make money off of a lot of like views that's the way my resident evil 6 game play or gameplay uh playthrough got got by the copyright and it was hold on let me see if i can find it what it what it

276
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:49,030
um hold on I think I still have the email what why it's so silly it's actually so silly this video cannot be monetized copyrighted copyrighted content has been detected in your video content used Resident Evil 6 Leon gameplay part 2 content owners Capcom I'm sorry I did Resident Evil 6 Leon Gameplay Part 2 in my video!

277
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,390
No!

278
00:20:51,690 --> 00:21:02,510
But I don't know if it's actually Capcom because it's like doesn't seem like Lego vending machine does look pretty darn cool.

279
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,890
Just know it's on perpetual back order so it'll take a bit to get Oh no, I saw it in a store.

280
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,390
I go to actual Lego stores and I saw it.

281
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,650
I just bought and built Lego Soundwave.

282
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,690
He's so effing cool with arms and super poseable.

283
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,010
Comes with a ravage and laser beacon.

284
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,850
They all transform.

285
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,610
What?

286
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,150
Wait, there's Lego Transformers?

287
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,970
I saw Weird Alive last month and I feel like if he personally knew you, he'd want you to listen to hardware stores so he didn't care.

288
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,150
Okay.

289
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,690
Yeah, I honestly don't care about the copyright kind of stuff.

290
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,410
As long as I don't get a strike on my channel.

291
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,670

It's been 30 minutes and I have just been sitting here.

332
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,840
And also listening to Weird Al.

333
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,040
Woo!

334
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,080

336
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,140
It's, like, making me always want to just all the time with you guys.

337
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,820
Because I don't...

338
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,720
I have so much...

339
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,280
Everything built up on my days off, you know.

340
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,020
Putting off loan payments to buy Legos.

341
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,720
To real.

342
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,420
Can't believe that I'm in shoes.

343
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,780
Oh yeah, the owl generated music.

344
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,160
Only 30 minutes yapping.

345
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
Yeah, sorry to whoever said that.

346
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,980
I don't know if you were being serious or not.

347
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,940
But I think you've been...

348
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,720
You've been...

349
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,860
outvoted.

350
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,380
You've been voted off the island.

351
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,900
No, we'll play, though.

352
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Let's see.

353
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:05,780
Okay.

354
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,800
New debt, baby, loan charge.

355
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:52,280
Okay, so this is a game where you um, you are fishing to pay off your debt, and then a magical fish comes and gives you an eyeball that makes you find more magical fish and they're worth they're worth money I think I think it's like dredge maybe yeah I was up with like fishing games and like horror I forgot my hat wait let me put it on real quick let me put on my hat one second give me a moment I put on my hat

357
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,310
I turned purple and forgot everything.

358
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,960
Where is it?

359
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,980
Okay, I found it.

360
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,750
It's my fishing hat.

361
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,170
It's my fishing hat.

362
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,290
Lucky, let's play the game.

363
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,590
Let's go fishing, baby.

364
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:34,850
New debt.

365
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,630
Loaning money.

366
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,070
How much money are we getting?

367
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,450
The lone shark lent you a pile of money.

368
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,030
Just a big old pile.

369
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,510
Now he wants it back with interest.

370
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,630
No, no interest.

371
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,750
Don't be interested in me.

372
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:06,070
You have to work all night.

373
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,990
Every night.

374
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,170
You have no choice.

375
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,150
Your debt is...

376
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,770
Oh, oh, it's still going up.

377
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,790
Oh, it's still going up.

378
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,930
Oh, it's still going up.

379
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,870
Oh, oh.

380
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:32,950
This fish better be worth 100,000 bucks each.

381
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,730
Fish as much as you can.

382
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,570
Oh.

383
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,430
Okay.

384
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,310
How do I fish?

385
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:45,690
Ooh.

386
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,850
I got my beers.

387
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,530
Holy gulp.

388
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,270
My gosh.

389
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,450
I got a little bell.

390
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,290
I'm on the Vida Nova.

391
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,710
Beer o'clock, baby.

392
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:05,850
Yeah.

393
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,530
Oh.

394
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,930
This isn't so bad.

395
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,090
Everybody.

396
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:14,690
Oh, wait.

397
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:22,550
I'm going to move you guys over just a smidge so that we can see the price better.

398
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:23,930
There you guys go.

399
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,710
Wow, this is actually so nice.

400
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,650
I would be fishing every night if it were like this.

401
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,530
Look, not a soul out here.

402
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,210
Except for me, of course.

403
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,680
Wow, it's pretty, isn't it?

404
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,080
here?

405
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,120
Oh, shut up.

406
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,180
Is that what I think that is right there?

407
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,160
You guys see that?

408
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,000
I think that's a ghostbuster.

409
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,300
Maybe I'm not welcome here.

410
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,220
Fishing logbook.

411
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,680
Fishing notes scribbled on torn out page margins.

412
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,140
Ah, this is some fishing music.

413
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:54,320
the line at least eight meters if you're too close nothing bites oh the fish either struggles or rests when it rests pull without fear when struggles pull too but watch the line tension if the line tension hits the max the line breaks when you feel it's about to snap let go it's kind of cut off a little bit sorry don't repeat his his mistakes who's he My box,

414
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:54,720
oh fish.

415
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,260
You need a gutted fish.

416
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,900
And I saw some blood over here.

417
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,780
Oh, this is the gutting board.

418
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,300
Okay, guys.

419
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,160
Let's...

420
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,900
Fish!

421
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,580
Oh, just above eight meters.

422
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,120
Oh, any fish around?

423
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,860
Oh, oh, yeah, they really are.

424
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,440
They're around.

425
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm just a little... Oh!

426
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,600
I'm just a little...

427
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,800
Little guy in the water.

428
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,140
Where's the fish?

429
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,560
Uh.

430
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,540
Oh, shoot.

431
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,320
How do I pull?

432
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,390
Oh, there we go.

433
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,440
Oh, I'm pulling.

434
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:37,800
I'm pulling.

435
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,240
Don't get it too high.

436
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,320
Oh, my gosh.

437
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,220
How do I...

438
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,120
How the hell...

439
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,900
What am I pressing?

440
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,680
I can't tell.

441
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,000
Is it left click or is it...

442
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,840
Is it WASDA?

443
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,200
Nothing seems to be working.

444
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,980
I'm at the fish.

445
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:07,540
his mercy quite honestly oh I I got him when caught it grinds its teeth oh

446
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:32,620
come here fishy I'm so sorry for you I must put you on the gutting ward oh it's good gruesome.

447
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,620
This is the fishy reality.

448
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,180
Oh, there goes my debt lowering.

449
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,530
The lure... No, I want to pick up the bottles that are rolling around.

450
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,630
Hold on.

451
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,550
Let's see a different song.

452
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,070
I like this one.

453
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,250
I don't actually quite understand how the fishing... Oh!

454
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:04,870
Oops.

455
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:05,810
No, no, no, no.

456
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,390
Come back, come back.

457
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,810
I think it's left click.

458
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,770
Oh, yeah!

459
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,180
This might be the longest stream ever, everybody.

460
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,880
Oh, oh.

461
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,220
We have a little fish.

462
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,380
There they are.

463
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,200
Come on in.

464
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,760
My lure is nice and bright.

465
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,680
I don't understand it.

466
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,460
I think I just left click.

467
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,320
Oh my gosh.

468
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,320
More tension.

469
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,100
More tension.

470
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,120
No, no.

471
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,670
Somehow.

472
00:35:47,750 --> 00:36:00,250
it works it's a mackerel how'd you know it is a fish rip rich it is a fish rip

473
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:15,330
thank you so much for the five gift thank you it is a fish rip rich and lipids

474
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,240
Ripsaba, actually, though.

475
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,220
But she is a mackerel, isn't she?

476
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,080
Now I think about it.

477
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,180
What game would you recommend for someone to get into MGS?

478
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,520
Metal Gear Solid 1!

479
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,460
There goes my debt.

480
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,600
Oh, I'm not very good at this.

481
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:37,900
Hold on.

482
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,640
Let's try again.

483
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,680
I think I...

484
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,440
There we go.

485
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,480
What?

486
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,000
What?

487
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,800
It was in the red.

488
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,760
You guys saw that, no?

489
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,700
Oh, the blue is the max.

490
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,500
Okay, just kidding.

491
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,200
Just kidding, just kidding.

492
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,580
Oh, oh, someone's perusing.

493
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,780
Oh, he's got his own theme song.

494
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,540
Where is he?

495
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,480
Oh, he's ugly.

496
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,240
Oh, we're pulling you in.

497
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,650
I hear my music.

498
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,670
Come on in.

499
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,110
I'm pulling you in.

500
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,350
I'm pulling it...

501
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,870
Jackpot!

502
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,490
It has only one eye.

503
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,050
It's Dfish.

504
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,250
He has one eye.

505
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,880
It's Dfish.

506
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,100
Alright, buddy.

507
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,500
You're getting gutted.

508
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,710
That hurts!

509
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,070
Get it off, get it off, get it off!

510
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,850
Angler, you've caught me.

511
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,970
I'm a magic fish, but I can't leave until I've repaid my debt.

512
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,690
He's just like me.

513
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,430
Private property is sacred.

514
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,790
And now I belong to you.

515
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,710
This is the beginning of your fairy tale.

516
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,710
Want to see how it goes?

517
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,870
I could just gut him.

518
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,650
We'll play the game.

519
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,270
Then turn the page.

520
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,470
Oh!

521
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,410
He just poofs away.

522
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,990
A puff of smoke.

523
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,530
Oh!

524
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,640
My name is Caglioso.

525
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,700
Magic fish, sea vet, and giver of advice.

526
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:31,760
when someone young like you catches me they deserve a reward it's the only way i can free myself and i'm not talking about a bouquet of flowers the magic fish coglios coglios my dear angler i bring you prosperity now i'm gonna open my mouth inside you'll find a tiny little It's mine.

527
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,800
It fell a long time ago.

528
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,060
Cal...

529
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:37,980
Caluso...

530
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,560
Caluso?

531
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,660
Now, I thought he wanted a big old kiss.

532
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,840
It might look like fish waste to you, but it's a powerful artifact.

533
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,400
Hook it on your line like bait.

534
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,140
Oh.

535
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,820
Oh!

536
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,300
I got achievement.

537
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,160
A little help.

538
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,180
Damn.

539
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,340
You wear it well.

540
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,680
Oh my gosh, he's playing.

541
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,900
learning with me.

542
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
Now go and fish.

543
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,100
You'll see.

544
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,640
Okay.

545
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,800
I wear it well, huh?

546
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,880
Oh, I did it again.

547
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,480
What the heck?

548
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,860
That was in the middle.

549
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,400
I'm gonna go up.

550
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,280
Ah, yeah.

551
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,000
20.

552
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,440
20 meters.

553
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:23,800
Oh.

554
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,580
Who's eyeing me?

555
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,540
Who's eyeing me?

556
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,320
Oh.

557
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,980
Who are you?

558
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,860
Who are you, pretty baby?

559
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,580
It sounds kind of spooky in here, no?

560
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,660
Kind of...

561
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,840
The music is like... not the music, the ambience.

562
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,920
How it sounds so much like you're underwater, you know?

563
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,300
It's kind of spooky.

564
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,360
Oh, I hear my music!

565
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,800
The sea is spooky, you think so?

566
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
You were the fish on the hook.

567
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,960
Oh my gosh, we're gonna make it out of here.

568
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,280
We're gonna make it out of here, everybody.

569
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,240
You have to go.

570
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,720
I thought he was talking to me.

571
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,360
I'm sprinting.

572
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,460
Oh.

573
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:31,980
Oh.

574
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:33,780
Oh.

575
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,700
I think I got...

576
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,920
Is this a parrotfish?

577
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,060
I actually didn't see what it was saying.

578
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,240
Nice, huh?

579
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,340
The scales on that fish?

580
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,400
Pure gold.

581
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,160
Worth as much as it weighs.

582
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,000
Eh, eh.

583
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,200
This was my reward for a top-notch angler like you.

584
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,300
Now we're even, and I'm free.

585
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,780
So I'm taking back my...

586
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,220
No!

587
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,240
Don't take back your eye.

588
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,500
As much as I'd love to leave it with you, it's my property.

589
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,400
And private property is sacred.

590
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,760
Aw, man.

591
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,960
We have to go back to a stupid 15-pound fish.

592
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,780
Look, not to pry.

593
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,360
But I've seen you fish in here for weeks now.

594
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,160
Megalodon.

595
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,800
Got him.

596
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,460
We should have gutted him and then taken his eye.

597
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,740
Day in night.

598
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,380
Day in night.

599
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:27,980
Day in.

600
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,940
You get it.

601
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,480
You're working this hard because you have to, right?

602
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,660
Money troubles.

603
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,540
It's none of your beeswax.

604
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,600
Sorry.

605
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,320
You're right.

606
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,480
I've already taken the liking to you.

607
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,320
I worry.

608
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,980
I think he likes me, guys.

609
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,260
You remind me of my younger self.

610
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,840
Minus the gills, of course.

611
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,640
Not in your business.

612
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,340
Nacho cheese.

613
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,900
Fairyfish, but I only see why.

614
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,560
Oh, don't.

615
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,600
Alright, I'm off.

616
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,840
But if you ever need help, ring that nice bell hanging behind you.

617
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,500
I'll come by to check on you.

618
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,920
Goodbye, angler.

619
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,140
No, mister.

620
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,860
Oh.

621
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,550
Oh, is that the phone?

622
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,630
The phone?

623
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,490
Hold on.

624
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,370
I'm busy.

625
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,270
I'm fishing.

626
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,390
Okay.

627
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,850
I don't think anything's...

628
00:43:37,870 --> 00:44:02,650

630
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,510
Nice hair.

631
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,930
You like my hat too?

632
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,790
But it's been too long.

633
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:43,570
Return to port?

634
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,470
Pull into yours.

635
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,550
You need to bring me all the money to the usual spot.

636
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,390
I've got 45 minutes?

637
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,520
Don't screw around.

638
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,040
Wait!

639
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,100
That's a real- that's a real timer!

640
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,160
Whoa!

641
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

642
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,800
Ring a ling ling!

643
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,310
Why'd you call me, angler?

644
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,350
You're looking for more golden fish?

645
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,710
What's going on?

646
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,390
Isn't what I gave you enough?

647
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,250
Bro, I'm in so much trouble!

648
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,750
Lay it out for me.

649
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,530
The lone shark's demanding all his money back tonight.

650
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:30,470
Is that so...

651
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:33,470
You know a thing or two about fishing, that's for sure.

652
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,790
But when it comes to money, you're clueless.

653
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,730
Look at the mess you're in.

654
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,650
I'll lend you the eye.

655
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,470
Enough so you can nearly pay off your debt.

656
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:44,050
Nearly!

657
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,250
Why are you so stingy?

658
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,770
Come on!

659
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,770
But I'm not doing it for free.

660
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,470
I see you've got a nice crate of beer.

661
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,050
Bring me one.

662
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:57,710
Oh, yeah.

663
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,750
A cold bottle of beer.

664
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,430
Oh, yeah, a nice cold one with the fish.

665
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,230
Saltwater leaves your sword.

666
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,310
Your throat sore.

667
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,670
I can't read, everybody.

668
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:11,970
There you go.

669
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,370
You can have as many as you want.

670
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:15,270
Finally.

671
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,310
Working hard or hardly working.

672
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,210
I'm working hard.

673
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,890
Wait, the timer is still going down.

674
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:21,610
Oh my gosh.

675
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:22,610
Finally.

676
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:23,950
I can't take it anymore.

677
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,190
I have to drink it now.

678
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,690
Do you think that our fishy friend here was a human?

679
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:33,290
Didn't the book say don't make the past mis- Don't make his mistakes?

680
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,230
Do you think our fishy friend here...

681
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,290
Was it past angler, maybe?

682
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,410
Beer in exchange for 700k euro.

683
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,550
Open it and pour it into my mouth.

684
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:48,950
Okay.

685
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,090
Um.

686
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,070
Into the mouth.

687
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,730
Nice and cold.

688
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,170
Just how I like it.

689
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,770
You're better as a waiter than as an angler, I guess.

690
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,790
I am a maid, after all.

691
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:10,990
Here's the eye.

693
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,290
Thank you.

694
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,790
Beer battered fish.

695
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,090
Take good care of it.

696
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:16,970
It's just a rental.

697
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,310
You can go.

698
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:19,830
Go.

699
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,290
Oh.

700
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,230
Whoa.

701
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:27,460
It was so loud.

702
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,260
Oh my god.

703
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,480
Go fish now.

704
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,760
Golly, mister.

705
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,700
Oh, okay.

706
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,860
Ah, I drank it on accident.

707
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,720
Okay.

708
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,020
I was going to give it to him.

709
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,980
Maybe he's not thirsty.

710
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,280
Ooh, it's freaky looking.

711
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,580
Did you guys see that?

712
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:06,160
I think if we caught that, if we sold that, it would be crazy bucks.

713
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,340
Hello?

714
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,440
Yeah, I'm not really one of those people that's afraid of the sea, you know?

715
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,020
Can I move at all?

716
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,840
Oh, oh!

717
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,120
We're being viewed!

718
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,740
Hello!

719
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,100
Oh, there it is!

720
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,520
Ooh, its lips look like really...

721
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,480
Like, realistic.

722
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,760
Like a human's...

723
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,740
Human lips, you know?

724
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,500
Oh, I'm...

725
00:48:40,520 --> 00:49:03,320

726
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:13,320
interesting sushi

727
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,500
Whoa, 24!

728
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,500
My PB!

729
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,020
What is that noise?

730
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,060
What is all this noise?

731
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,700
Oh my gosh.

732
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,940
I don't like it.

733
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,160
It sounds huge.

734
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,160
I said I'm not afraid of the ocean, but...

735
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
What if I am?

736
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,200
But like, when I go swimming and stuff, I'm not afraid of the ocean.

737
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:40,620
afraid of like my feet not you know when he can't touch the bottom or whatever i hear i hear our music we're safe come on a peacock bash you can't escape death i'm not trying to can a girl why do i have debt as a ghost this is messed up this is so messed up

738
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,880
Rental's over!

739
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,340
I'm taking back the eye.

740
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,920
Private property is sacred.

741
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,300
Why does it keep saying that?

742
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,780
Fish got walked with legs.

743
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,980
It looked like a frog.

744
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,180
The student loans.

745
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:09,640
No!

746
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,720
No, don't take back my eye, please.

747
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,060
You've made yourself a nice little staff.

748
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,720
You certainly won't need my help anymore.

749
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,580
Actually, I think I do, though.

750
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,180
But in the unlikely case you need me, ring the bell.

751
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,140
Oh, no.

752
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,820
No, no, no.

753
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,480
They're calling me again.

754
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,160
No, no, no.

755
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,600
It's me, Angler.

756
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,300
Change of plans.

757
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,820
You have to bring me double the amount!

758
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,260
I was still at a million, though.

759
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,400
Please!

760
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,600
I protest.

761
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,860
Wait, you think I'm your charity case?

762
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,780
I ask for as much as I want.

763
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,160
And anyway, it's not only up to me.

764
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,560
I also have debts to pay.

765
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,860
Oh, it's not even just like...

766
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,800
It's not even double...

767
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,400
Oh my god.

768
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,780
Listen, I know it's a shitty situation.

769
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,500
So you might want to...

770
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:13,980
I don't know.

771
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,680
Run away.

772
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:16,620
Wait.

773
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:46,080
anchor shall we say don't do it you may run away but your debt stays and i have to go ask for the money from people you know this is so evil think about the people you care about people who don't even know what shit you've gotten into imagine their faces when they hear the doorbell they find me Do I have anyone that cares about me?

774
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,900
I've bought a boat all day and night.

775
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,060
If they don't have the money either, things get really bad.

776
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,580
Do you want it to go like that?

777
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,560
Yes, no, fuck off.

778
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,360
I kind of want to be a little Frenchman.

779
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:03,940
Fuck off.

780
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,640
I'm not the one who makes the rules.

781
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,120
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

782
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,560
I hope you're sailing towards the harbor.

783
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,480
Ah!

784
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:15,620
Fish!

785
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,560
Fish!

786
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:17,680
Fish!

787
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:20,460
Fish!

788
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,540
Ah!

789
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,300
Wait, there was... Did you guys see... There was a... There was a head there!

790
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,640
Did you guys see that?

791
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,820
Sorry.

792
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,060
Ugh!

793
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,240
Again, angler?

794
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,060
Did I imagine that?

795
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,460
What head?

796
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,660
No, you guys didn't see?

797
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,640
You really can't do anything without me, can you?

798
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,800
How much of that debt is still left?

799
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,080
Like, an unimaginable amount.

800
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,960
I'm gonna tell him.

801
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,860
I'm gonna tell him.

802
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,620
So he knows the real...

803
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,300
I need the I for as long as I need it.

804
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,020
Damn.

805
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,320
I've met hungry sharks, but yours is starving.

806
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,160
How do you even rack up that much debt?

807
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,500
That's a great question.

808
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,200
No offense, but come on.

809
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,960
You seemed like a sharp one.

810
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,340
But now I realize you have no clue how to work in this business.

811
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,040
You did everything wrong.

812
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,260
Do you agree?

813
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,540
Hey, answer me.

814
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,620
Do you agree?

815
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,240
Oh, I only have 35 minutes.

816
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,200
But if we start getting big fish, it should be fine, no?

817
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,720
I'll just agree.

818
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,200
I don't want to be a quitter.

819
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,560
Umamusame addiction, so true.

820
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,240
Yes, what?

821
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,500
Yes, I did.

822
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,260
Everything wrong.

823
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:51,960
Exactly.

824
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,980
You reeled in Cogliuso.

825
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,900
Here, only by sheer dumb luck.

826
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,200
Go on, say it.

827
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,560
What do you want me to say?

828
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,400
Oh, what does that have to do with anything?

829
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,200
That has everything to do with it.

830
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,060
We need to define our terms.

831
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,620
You want to waste more time?

832
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,540
No, no, repeat what I told you.

833
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,940
I fished up Caglioso by sheer dove luck.

834
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,840
Now we can get down to business.

835
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,880
This debt isn't something we fix over a couple of beers.

836
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,240
But since I pity you, here's an offer, okay?

837
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,180
I'll sell you my eye.

838
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,000
Just think endless goldenfish, okay?

839
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,580
Pay off your debts tonight.

840
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,560
Become a millionaire by morning.

841
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,140
But in return, I want something valuable.

842
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,000
An eye for an eye.

843
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,400
I want something valuable.

844
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,300
Something like...

845
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,420
Your eye!

846
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,160
I called it.

847
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,400
I know, I know.

848
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,020
You're thinking how gross that is.

849
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,000
But I don't make the rules.

850
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,740
Who's making the rules then?

851
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,800
I run a free enterprise.

852
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,020
Not a charity.

853
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,920
Private property is sacred.

854
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,120
It should be valued.

855
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,200
You're the one who got yourself into debt.

856
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,080
You've already got the gutting knife.

857
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,560
Think about it.

858
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,220
No rush.

859
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,500
We've got all the time in the world, right?

860
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,420
We don't!

861
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:28,960
We don't!

862
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:29,600
We don't!

863
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:29,960
Oh!

864
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:36,830
Am I getting cursed?

865
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,930
We can't go back without the full payment.

866
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,690
No, the onboard phone.

867
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:53,350
Nah, that big thing was a drive by burp fish.

868
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,810
Oh, that was from 15 minutes ago.

869
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,310
Oh, my gosh.

870
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,250
You're hesitant?

871
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:00,970
Let me help you.

872
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:02,270
Gowd out your eye.

873
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,930
It's the best investment you can make in this life.

874
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,130
How do I...

875
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,410
Oh, I need the knife, I guess.

876
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:12,170
Do you want to gouge your eye out?

877
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:12,530
See!

878
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,230
See!

879
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:17,790
I have my eyes.

880
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,790
Ah, you can kind of see it behind me.

881
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,230
Here you go.

882
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,110
That wound's burning now.

883
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,110
But you did the right thing.

884
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:26,870
Trust me.

885
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,050
Here's my eye.

886
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,510
No, your eye.

887
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,490
Yeah, an eye for an eye, mister.

888
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,430
Oh, you wear it so well.

889
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,770
What a nice shiny new eye.

890
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,690
Smile, you can pay off all your debt now.

891
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,270
I'm staying here with you.

892
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,550
I can't do it alone.

893
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,710
That much is clear.

894
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,210
Oh, right?

895
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,050
Answer me.

896
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,990
I can't do it alone!

897
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,470
I'm just... I'm just...

898
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,790
I'm just giving this guy everything he wants.

899
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:08,970
Oh my... You can see the right side is now like all red and stuff.

900
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,110
Oops, that was not a good throw.

901
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,090
I need to look up more.

902
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:15,410
Gamers don't look up.

903
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,050
Oh my god!

904
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,030
That was kind of freaky!

905
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,290
What about his eyes?

906
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,390
Oh, someone's viewing us.

907
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,250
Is this like a speed dating?

908
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:41,550
Here he comes!

909
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:44,150

911
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,880

916
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:14,680
Instead of a goose that lays golden eggs, I have an eyeball that gives me golden fish.

917
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,620
I guess they would be attracted to, like, the shininess of the eye, I suppose.

918
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,580
Oh, yeah, baby!

919
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,000
I'm scared to turn around.

920
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,280
I feel like I'm going to see a spooky thing in the side there.

921
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:35,890
Oh.

922
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:39,050
I feel like my ship's haunted now.

923
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:41,190
Watching you fish.

924
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,310
I really wonder how you thought buying a boat was a good idea.

925
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,810
I mean, you know you fish like shit, right?

926
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,950
Like Saruzo.

927
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,230
He was just like you.

928
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,330
Oh, maybe that's the guy.

929
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,490
We're being compared to.

930
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,930
Oh, my gosh.

931
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,630
I'm just getting better and better, you guys.

932
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,090
25.5.

933
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:09,030
What do you mean I fish like shit?

934
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:17,490
I got 25 meters away.

935
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:19,530
We're gaming.

936
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,320
28 minutes.

937
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,040
Wait, does the game end in 28 minutes?

938
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,480
Johnny, yes, Papa.

939
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,880
Catching fish, no, Papa.

01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,090
Oh.

944
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,330
Oh my god.

945
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,330
Oh my god!

946
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:47,650
My eye!

947
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,840
A giant hand snatched your eye?

948
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,280
That bastard just won't quit.

949
01:02:59,260 --> 01:02:59,480
Who?

950
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,940
That bastard?

951
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:01,900
Nothing, nothing.

952
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,960
Don't worry, you won't see him again.

953
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,140
I'll tell my associate to keep him away from now on.

954
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,840
Let's get back to business.

955
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,220
Saruzo took his eye, yeah.

956
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:16,950
Back to business.

957
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:17,810
Yeah, back to business.

958
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,270
Angler, you lost the eye.

959
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:20,390
You were myself?

960
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,610
But lucky for you, I've got to spit.

961
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,930
How many eyes you have?

962
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,830
But as you know, well, no, I don't do anything for free.

963
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:30,250
Luckily for you, I'm a bit hungry.

964
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:36,910
If you let me eat one of your golden fish, golden-ish, I'll give you a new eye.

965
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,630
Wait, but my dad!

966
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:42,390
Yeah, whose eye is this anyway?

967
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,950
Who else would it be?

968
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:46,230
It's mine.

969
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,630
How many eyes does a fish have?

970
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,710
It's mine because I bought it.

971
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:54,290
I keep a reserve.

972
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,770
Thought you were the first I did business with?

973
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,990
I told you I'm an entrepreneur.

974
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,910
Some invest in oils, some in gold.

975
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:04,270
I invest in eyes.

976
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,150
Enough about my business.

977
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,790
Let's talk about yours.

978
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:09,990
Do you accept my offer?

979
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,990
Oh, I only have 25 minutes.

980
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:16,510
What if I decline?

981
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,430
I need all the fish I can get.

982
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,610
Yes, this is some fishy business, eh?

983
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,030
Can we gut him?

984
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:26,570
I know.

985
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:32,610
I'll just keep going.

986
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:35,490
My belly's calling.

987
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,290
Better not lose this one.

988
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,910
No, the number go up!

989
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,790
No, number go up!

990
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,970
Actually, lose it and I'll have another snack.

991
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,630
I've got plenty in stock.

992
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:49,610
How many times is this guy taking people's eyes?

993
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:50,810
Alright.

994
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:52,310
Nope.

995
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:56,190
We don't want any hand coming from the deep.

996
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:57,330
24!

997
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,530
It just beeped at me.

998
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,290
Also, sorry if that was so loud, the noise.

999
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:06,170
I tried to turn it down when it happened.

1000
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:07,370
It's loud for me, too.

1001
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:09,030
Hello?

1002
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,170
Hello, tasty fish.

1003
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:15,950
You're not tasty, you're you're wealthy.

1004
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,760
Ooh, this one's pretty.

1005
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,960
I like the markings.

1006
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,940
I like how the eyes are shadowed, though.

1007
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,860
We have our Hentai protagonist fish here.

1008
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:40,700
No!

1009
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,520
Oh my gosh, I let the tension get He was too high!

1010
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,080
He was right there!

1011
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,280
I messed up!

1012
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:49,800
No!

1013
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,260
Our fish!

1014
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,180
Oh my gosh, I'm such an idiot.

1015
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,780
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come!

1016
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,300
Oh, he's back, he's back!

1017
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,620
He couldn't resist the temptation.

1018
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,560
He says, yeah, I know.

1019
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,060
I shouldn't be hanging out with you, but...

1020
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,180
You just got such a pretty eye, a little lady.

1021
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,120
I'm

1022
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,920
careful now, I'm careful.

1023
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,520
You

1024
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,990
guys think we'll make it?

1025
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,110
Oh yeah, yeah.

1026
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:45,510
Black spotted grunt.

1027
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:48,010
Saruza wants his eye back!

1028
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:48,810
Wait!

1029
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,630
Wait, wait, wait.

1030
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:54,330
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1031
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,270
Please, please, please.

1032
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:05,150
I have so much more.

1033
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:06,590
It's a fish.

1034
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:08,550
Here, we get the best fish up here.

1035
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,190
This is my best throw.

1036
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,370
Wow, it really is my best throw.

1037
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,610
At 28 meters.

1038
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:17,670
That's crazy.

1039
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:27,770
Yes.

1040
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:29,790
You can't resist.

1041
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:31,450
Oh my god, I'm just getting a hole.

1042
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,270
Oh my god.

1043
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,290
But full of...

1044
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,850
Fish.

1045
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,550
Come on, come on.

1046
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:41,530
Come on, come on.

1047
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:45,110
Actually, how much is that even?

1048
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,730
Two million?

1049
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,180
I can't tell.

1050
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,700
I'm staring at the little white bar.

1051
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,000
Little white bar going back and forth.

1052
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,140
Oh, high tension.

1054
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:58,980
Attention.

1055
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:00,500
Low tension.

1056
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,280
High tension.

1057
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:03,680
Come on.

1058
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:04,660
Come on.

1059
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,660
bored, buddy.

1060
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,220
Come home.

1061
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,160
To Papa.

1062
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:10,680
Stop.

1063
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:14,600
Oh, this butt got in my way!

1064
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,720
Oh.

1065
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,440
That was my best throw, too.

1066
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,240
This butt got in my way!

1067
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,920

Never willing to listen to learn from those who really know shit.

01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,880
In the jaws of the lone shark.

1082
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,220
I don't need to hear your lectures.

1083
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,900
I understand I'm in a predicament.

1084
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,140
Unbelievable.

1085
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,080
You did it.

1086
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,880
Oh my gosh, that was it.

1087
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,900
You have all the gold you need to pay off the debt.

1088
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,900
If I were you, I'd run to the cabin and start the engine right now.

1089
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,140
Why are you saying it like that?

1090
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,460
There are people on the ground waiting.

1091
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,920
But always remember, if you have a problem, you don't know how to solve.

1092
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,400
If you don't know what to do.

1093
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,420
Mint cranking her bowl of the catch fish.

1094
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,020
Ring the bell and I'll come help you.

1095
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,020
I don't see how you could screw things up again.

1096
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:07,620
But you've shown me more than once tonight that you're not exactly sharp.

1097
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,740
So I won't say goodbye.

1098
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,180
Oh, no, please.

1099
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:17,640
Okay.

1100
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,700
I need a drink before I talk to this guy.

1101
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,260
Just drive the bow?

1102
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,200
I should have, right?

1103
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,260
You still haven't shown up.

1104
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,440
Be honest.

1105
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,680
Do you have that money?

1106
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:31,820
Yes?

1107
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:32,800
Yes?

1108
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,220
Yes?

1109
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,780
Then push the engine to the max and teleport yourself here or teleport the money off.

1110
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,640
For all I care.

1111
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,300
I don't want this end badly.

1112
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,060
I really don't.

1113
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,200
So be on time.

1114
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:42,560
I'm going.

1115
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,020
I'm going.

1116
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:47,580
Oh.

1117
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,740
He won't mind if I'm like a few minutes late, right?

1118
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,320
Can I fish while I...

1119
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:01,560
No.

1120
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,940
It's the same as before.

1121
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:22,130
Um.

1122
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:25,210
This is so peaceful, though, no?

1123
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:25,710
No.

1124
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:54,870
this is so nice ring the bell what if i tell him though hey what's up what do you mean you're running late what did you buy that costly autopilot for if you still show up late christ on a bike do you realize the position you're putting me in i would have given you another month but my bosses got tired of waiting you're dead if you don't make it on time i shouldn't have lent you this freaking money why the hell did you go solo Listen,

1125
01:12:55,390 --> 01:13:00,810
pray to San Gennaro, clever stream title.

1126
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:03,870
Pray to the moon, pray to the sea.

1127
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:07,110
But get here before time runs out.

1128
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,440
Angler, hold on a moment, I'm thinking.

1129
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,600
Was it 2008 or 2011?

1130
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,240
I'll let him figure it out.

1131
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:35,500
2011.

1132
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:41,060
I've been thinking about Seruzo, that angler I told you about.

1133
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,180
Yeah, it's 2011, you guys.

1134
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:52,500
If it were 2011, right, like if you were teleported back to 2011 right now, what would you do?

1135
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,780
Are some of you even alive then?

1136
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,460
Invest in Bitcoin!

1137
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,100
Why are so many of you saying that?

1138
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,100
people immediately back on back on back on

1139
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:56,830
so funny they're not wrong it was just so it wasn't like uh i would make sure i studied harder so i passed that exam that i was really sad i didn't get an a in or oh i would i i would i would be brave and i would ask that person out No, Bitcoin, Bitcoin,

1140
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:57,450
Bitcoin!

1141
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,170
Okay, Saruzo was buried in debt too.

1142
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:02,750
Actually, you know what?

1143
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,190
Let me tell you a story.

1144
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,010
Uh, we only have 15 minutes.

1145
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,030
Let's interrupt him.

1146
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:11,830
I'll stop you right there.

1147
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:14,670
You called me because you need my help again, right?

1148
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,250
The terms are simple then.

1149
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,950
I listen to you if you listen to me first.

1150
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:19,690
Fair, right?

1151
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:20,490
Now shut up.

1152
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:22,570
Once upon a time, there was Saruzo.

1153
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,810
He was a young man who wanted to live off the...

1154
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:25,550
the sea and fish.

1155
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:26,970
But he wasn't born into a rich family.

1156
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:28,390
He couldn't just buy a boat with his own money.

1157
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:30,130
He went to work for a rich captain.

1158
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:32,370
But according to Saruso, the captain was useless.

1159
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:35,490
He's captain only because he was born rich, Saruso used to say.

1160
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:36,450
In the end, he quit.

1161
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,870
He wanted to do things his way.

1162
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,490
To captain his own fishing boat.

1163
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,830
He had no money, but he had a friend who could lend him some.

1164
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,090
A lone shark.

1165
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:44,250
So he went into debt.

1166
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,350
What do you think of Saruso's choice?

1167
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,270
Quitting because he worked for an idiot.

1168
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,870
Wait, is that what I did?

1169
01:15:52,890 --> 01:16:15,890
Siruzo was Well, that's what I did Apparently Born with Bitcoin in his mouth Invest in mint coin Yeah, yeah, yeah Stocks are rising He was wrong So you condemn Siruzo's choice What about yours then?

1170
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:50,830
With the lone shark's money Siruzo finally bought his own fishing boat A piece of junk like yours just to be clear but he was so happy too bad reality caught up with him fast being captain of your own boat has its honors but mostly its burdens so Ruzzo had no more set hours no more steady paycheck the lone shark though was always on time demanding payments too bad the fishing season didn't go well that's the sea one day it fills your nets the next it pisses in your face some of you guys should become anglers I would know.

1171
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,070
I'm a sea veteran.

1172
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,870
Even Saruzo's former captain knew it.

1173
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:59,050
And he was rich, so we didn't care about a bad season.

1174
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,910
Saruzo, he never saw it coming.

1175
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,070
He didn't make a dime.

1176
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:08,630
He kept piling up debts just to keep his boat.

1177
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:11,130
Ended up working like a slave.

1178
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:14,950
All day long, every single day, until one night he caught me.

1179
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:18,070
Man, he was so proud to have me on his stupid hook.

1180
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,910
I thought I was some rare catch, that idiot.

1181
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:24,830
I bought my freedom with a golden fish.

1182
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,570
Saruzo wanted more.

1183
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,770
We made a trade, then another.

1184
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:33,310
Fish after fish he was willing to give more and more.

1185
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,890
He just didn't get the value of things.

1186
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:39,470
In the end, he even sold me his eye.

1187
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:41,410
Wait, this guy is just like me.

1188
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,550
The same eye you've got on your line!

1189
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:46,310
Oh!

1190
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,600
Why Saruzo is...

1191
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,160
Reaching from the depths?

1192
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:59,140
You said it was yours and you lost it.

1193
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,780
But it was mine.

1194
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,140
Saruzo sold it to me fair and square.

1195
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,280
It was my property.

1196
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,020
Oh no, the property is sacred.

1197
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,000
One last question.

1198
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:14,420
Who was the fish caught on the hook that night?

1199
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,700
Me or Saruzo?

1200
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,100
Saruzo?

1201
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:22,780
Good.

1202
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,180
And tonight...

1203
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,000
Just kidding.

1204
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,480
No need to answer.

1205
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:29,620
Glary tale's over.

1206
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,760
So what favor do you need this time?

1207
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,000
Deliver all the golden fish to your lone shark on time?

1208
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,260
Wait, how do we know the...

1209
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,300
Obviously the fish has magical powers, but how would we even know the fish could do that?

1210
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,860
You didn't think about deadlines.

1211
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,560
Kid, this job's not for you.

1212
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,640
I can deliver the fish, but that'd be a real miracle.

1213
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,020
I want your boat.

1214
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:53,360
know.

1215
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,040
Doesn't feel good hearing that, huh?

1216
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,540
But seriously, why do you care about that piece of junk?

1217
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,240
You've got my eye.

1218
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,700
Tomorrow you'll be sitting by the sea catching enough gold to buy five boats.

1219
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,560
Come on, I'm helping you out.

1220
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,360
This little boat isn't even worth the upkeep.

1221
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:12,920
Ficious scammer, me thinks.

1222
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,280
Perhaps.

1223
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:19,680
Do yourself a favor, sell it to me, then clear you're dead.

1224
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,540
Just like Ceruso did.

1225
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:23,980
No.

1226
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,580
Think it over, please.

1227
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:28,460
I can wait, and I will.

1228
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,560
But you know it's your best interest.

1229
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,300
Don't check in out now.

1230
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,720
Oh, my bow!

1231
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,500
Vita Nova!

1232
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,480
Oh, my bow.

1233
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,300
Oh, the beer cans.

1234
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh, oh, I have ten minutes.

1235
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:50,220
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1236
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,720
The moon has gone dark.

1237
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,480
I don't think that's the clouds.

1238
01:19:58,930 --> 01:19:59,410
Okay.

1239
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,130
I'll give you my boat.

1240
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:05,730
Do you want to sell me this rust bucket and get yourself out of this mess?

1241
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:07,890
Yes.

1242
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:11,810
How are we getting home without a boat?

1243
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,110
Yeah, I'm wondering that too.

1244
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:14,330
Good for you.

1245
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:18,170
Fish delivered.

1246
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,690
You made it, Angler.

1247
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,390
You don't need me anymore.

1248
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,170
Or my boat.

1249
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:23,830
Goodbye.

1250
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:27,050
Oh, it was.

1251
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,150
I was behind the clouds.

1252
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,580
Angler, I don't know how you did it.

1253
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,900
But I'm damn glad I lit a fire under your ass.

1254
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,380
Where did you get a suitcase full of gold?

1255
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,940
And you leave it to me without even showing up?

1256
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,060
Debt settled.

1257
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,520
You made it!

1258
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,880
Get back here right away.

1259
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:48,960
We gotta celebrate.

1260
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,220
I repaid my debt.

1261
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,560
No!

1262
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,780
Oh, hello.

1263
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,120
Oh.

1264
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,240
Oh.

1265
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:08,960
He's the actual lone shark.

1266
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,300
He's the real lone shark.

1267
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,720
It wasn't just a saying.

1268
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:24,870
Hello?

1269
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:28,830
There must be some misunderstanding.

1270
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,570
Where do you think you're going with my boat?

1271
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:37,110
forced me to have my associate smash your engine.

1272
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,530
That's not very professional of you.

1273
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:42,790
What have I always told you?

1274
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:45,150
Private property is sacred.

1275
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,090
Well now you're my property.

1276
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,990
I thought I thought I've got a part of the boat.

1277
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,470
I'm not public transportation.

1278
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,590
You owe me something in return.

1279
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:00,450
Well what can you offer me?

1280
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,130
Um, another beer.

1281
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:04,930
A beer?

1282
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,810
Pay me back for hauling you to shore?

1283
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:13,430
Give me a break.

1284
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:18,710
I figured you didn't know the true value of things, but now you're just ridiculous.

1285
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:21,970
Sorry, that's not gonna happen.

1286
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1287
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,540
Ah, what a night.

1288
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,520
I've got every satisfaction I wanted from you.

1289
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,460
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

1290
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,870
Am I lagging?

1291
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:42,550
A little bit.

1292
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:45,590
Look.

1293
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,740
Just in time, too, since my associate was getting impatient.

1294
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:57,060
They couldn't resist coming near the boat he was itching to.

1295
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,900
Before we say goodbye, one last question.

1296
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:05,840
Oh, for not to give him just one, make it a good one.

1297
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,280
Do you get the moral of the story?

1298
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:11,840
now?

1299
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:13,680
Not just Sarusos.

1300
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:14,660
Your story.

1301
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:21,340
What's the point of me learning a moral of a story if I don't live to learn from it?

1302
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,180
Attack him!

1303
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,800
I'm gonna attack him.

1304
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,360
Put that...

1305
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,240
Oh.

1306
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,360
Guys.

1307
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,140
07.

1308
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:50,900
No!

1309
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,220
No, please!

1310
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,540
Going towards the moon.

1311
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,640
This is a jump scare!

1312
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,560
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming.

1313
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:14,680
I'm swimming!

1314
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:20,420
What if I just kept swimming forever?

1315
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:23,340
Oh.

1316
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,320
Poor Italy.

1317
01:24:25,560 --> 01:25:07,680

1318
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,600
Why are they calling me a fucker?

1319
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:23,040
Like always the fucker had to quit a job and got independent Not great with numbers either Rumor has it the fucker borrowed

1320
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:54,920
Is someone gonna gonna crop this out with the fucker right next to me is this how they talk in Italy borrowed from the mob to buy a boat brilliant move right our brave angler disappeared into the thin air authorities think this stop calling me that they've

1321
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:12,300
had health issues and drifted off This fucking fucker Bailed on the debts I paid off my debts What are you talking about?

1322
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:19,960
And left the poor family Drowning in crap This is how they talk in Italy Yeah?

1323
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,820
Italian guy?

1324
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:37,720
Meanwhile, poor Italy You're just a little poorer today Uh Maybe that says Tens of thousands of euros Are being poured into searching For this so-called Missing person Tens of thousands of euros.

1325
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,920
That cash wasted on a smart ass who... Oh, I said pounds earlier.

1326
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,120
It was euros, wasn't it?

1327
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,140
I can't tell the difference sometimes.

1328
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:53,240
They look completely different, but my brain switches the two.

1329
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:01,600
Smart ass who almost certainly is sipping a cocktail on some tropical beach.

1330
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,080
Sorry, it's cut off a little bit.

1331
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,980
Something, don't these kids just go for...

1332
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:17,420
Oh, why don't these kids just go work for someone who knows what they're doing?

1333
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,820
Why take out a loan for a boat if you're just gonna sit on it drinking beer?

1334
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:26,180
Truth is, this generation doesn't want to hustle.

1335
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:30,220
I say they've got it coming.

1336
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,600
And I'll say this too.

1337
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,240
Get a damn job!

1338
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,200
Is that the boreal?

1339
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:38,920
Oh.

1340
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,220
The moral of the story is to get a job.

1341
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,500
Wait, it's over.

1342
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,240
That was so fast.

1343
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,930
Oh, yeah, Pixabay.

1344
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:55,270
I use them all the time.

1345
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:02,170
I think that's where I got my picture of the lawn, like.

1346
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,130
Get a job, they say.

1347
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,370
Um.

1348
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,320
Thanks for playing.

1349
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,280
If I go to the venue.

1350
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,000
Wow, we did it.

1351
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,240
Moral of the story is to invest in Bitcoin in 2011.

1352
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,060
Actually, though.

1353
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,720
Wait, that was so fast.

1354
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,780
Strange game.

1355
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:35,400
Thanks for the streaming to help you get 400k subscribers by tomorrow.

1356
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:37,680
Why?

1357
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,840
What's happening tomorrow?

1358
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,760
I'm a streamer.

1359
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:46,020
Is this a...

1360
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,340
But mine is a job, too.

1361
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,880
Is it calling me out?

1362
01:28:59,020 --> 01:28:59,740
Am I?

1363
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,280
Am I getting called out?

1364
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,820
I feel unemployed sometimes.

1365
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,660
Go back and gut him.

1366
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,660
So true!

1367
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,640
Let's try it.

1368
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,160
Let's see if we can gut the guy.

1369
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:19,360
We'll speedrun.

1370
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,860
Let's see if we can gut this dude.

1371
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:31,340

Thank you for this and for that!

1374
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,940
Wait, this unicorn fish is crazy!

1375
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,580
It feeds almost exclusively on algae.

1376
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,260
Wait, it's crazy!

1377
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,980
We could pay off our debts with a million of these.

1378
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,800
Alright, I think it's like what?

1379
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,080
Probably two fish or so?

1380
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:06,820
one.

1381
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:08,220
Unicorn fish.

1382
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,340
I thought it looks like a parrotfish though.

1383
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,860
Maybe parrotfish or more.

1384
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:17,580
Every time I see that like little beak, I think of a parrotfish.

1385
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,760
Ooh.

1386
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,100
Hello.

1387
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:22,980
Hello.

1388
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,880
I'm teasing him too.

1389
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,660
I teased too much.

1390
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,880
hard to get, you guys.

1391
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,460
I give up.

1392
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,820
Oh my gosh.

1393
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,600
Oh, I just didn't want to be seen as, like, too easy.

1394
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,600
Oh, man.

1395
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,680
This is horrible.

1396
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,260
It's fine.

1397
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,400
This guy's big.

1398
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,240
He's going to be worth a ton.

1399
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,080
Great thumbnail, thank you!

1400
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,420
Sorry, oh, there we go.

1401
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:19,340
Never knew how much I needed Shark Tooth, black, mascarid, purple-haired Minto in my life.

1402
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:22,580
Play too hard.

1403
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,660
You can tease me, Minto?

1404
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:25,420
Really?

1405
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:31,520
How?

1406
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:32,940
How do I tease?

1407
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:38,920
If hungry, it resorts to cannibalism.

1408
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:39,920
Wow.

1409
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,680
That's crazy.

1410
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,940
You already do?

1411
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,120
I do a little bit of teasing.

1412
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:56,560
Hey, did he turn off my music?

1413
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:04,990
Okay.

1414
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,070
No, we're speedrunning.

1415
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:06,690
We're speedrunning.

1416
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,910
We're speedrunning.

1417
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:13,130
We're speedrunning.

1418
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:13,750
Hey, come on.

1419
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:14,110
Come on.

1420
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:14,630
Come on.

1421
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,850
Oh, there he is.

1422
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:20,070
Oh, you mother effer.

1423
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:21,630
You call me an effer.

1424
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:22,790
you an F-er.

1425
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:25,030
Come on.

1426
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:26,510
God, you're ugly.

1427
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:28,210
You're ugly.

1428
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,430
I don't remember your name.

1429
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:34,550
Cag-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-g-l-u-so.

1430
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,930
Ugly-us-o.

1431
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,010
That's your name.

1432
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,070
D-fish.

1433
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:42,050
Come on, D-fish.

1434
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:43,990
You wish you could be D-Dog.

1435
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:47,850
It's like when you catch a magic carp and you're just like, God, this thing's useless.

1436
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:52,970
But D-Dog is Great from the start.

1437
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,450
I think she teases us because she kind of likes us.

1438
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:58,410
What are you talking about?

1439
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,220
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1440
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,300
That hurts!

1441
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,680
Angler, you caught me.

1442
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,640
Private property is sacred.

1443
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:11,740
Blah, blah.

1444
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:11,980
Oh!

1445
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:21,330
Okay, he probably would have said the same thing, though, no?

1446
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,920
I hate the way he looks at me.

1447
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,800
I don't think he would have said anything different, though.

1448
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,080
Okay, let me try.

1449
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,360
Let me try.

1450
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,500
Let me try again.

1451
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,520
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1452
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:56,680
I'm the worst.

1453
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,800
The run is dead.

1454
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:03,520
The run is dead.

1455
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:05,540
I can't believe I did that.

1456
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,560
Okay, I'll go slower this time.

1457
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,760
Okay.

1458
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,160
This is kind of nice, though, just the fishing part.

1459
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,840
Yeah, I'm going to tease him.

1460
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,340
Hey, hey there, big boy.

1461
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:29,840
Oh, oh.

1462
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,120
Oh, you like the way I...

1463
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,360
Oh.

1464
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,340
See, this looks like a parrotfish.

1465
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,200
Well, what was it?

1466
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,040
The unicorn, I feel like he's got that little...

1467
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,800
He's got the little thing on his head, no?

1468
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,880
What was with the giant guy in the sea then?

1469
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,160
Was that Ceruso?

1470
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,460
Was that when he got eaten by the shark?

1471
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,560
If he was so big, he could have just crushed the shark himself.

1472
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,220
Teased us with that run.

1473
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:13,360
No, this is...

1474
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,440
Did they just put the scientific name of this fish in?

1475
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:21,080
It is a poisonous but not lethal fish.

1476
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:22,640
Okay.

1477
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:26,570
Property is sacred.

1478
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:29,150
Property is sacred, little guy.

1479
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:32,630
Why do I have to gut them?

1480
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:34,850
Wouldn't it be more money if I...

1481
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:39,150
Let them do all the work?

1482
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,210
Sigma Jarvis.

1483
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:47,430
Here he comes!

1484
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:48,170
Coming in high!

1485
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:49,830
Where is he?

1486
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:50,330
Hello?

1487
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:51,590
Oh, there he is.

1488
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:53,850
Hentai Protag.

1489
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,580
It doesn't help that sometimes they accidentally go too high tension.

1490
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,240
I get too excited.

1491
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,020
I have high tension.

1492
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,400
I'm a high tension ghost.

1493
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,640
Ghost gal.

1494
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:16,080
Incognito cat.

1495
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,100
Thank you so much for the fight.

1496
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:17,980
Get the thank you!

1497
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,020
Thank you, thank you.

1498
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:26,700
Okay.

1499
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:28,720
Next guy.

1500
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,060
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1501
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:30,960
I forgot to tell you.

1502
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,420
I don't usually get VTuber stuff on my TikTok at all.

1503
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,860
Like, I just kind of like to keep it extremely...

1504
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:40,420
It's mostly like idols and animals.

1505
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,460
But if you're watching this...

1506
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,740
If you're...

1507
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:50,040
If you're watching this, I saw your TikTok.

1508
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:54,460
Where it was just like, I asked VTubers where to go eat in Japan.

1509
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:58,460
And it was when I said Mossburger, which is great, by the way.

1510
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:01,020
And...

1511
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,280
And the guy was like, I went to Mossberger.

1512
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,380
Thanks for the gift, the ducky.

1513
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:08,720
I went to Mossberger.

1514
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:11,160
And then people were clowning me in the comments.

1515
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,180
I was like, oh, what could people be saying?

1516
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,860
They were clowning me in the comments.

1517
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:26,120
They were, they were like, deserve!

1518
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:27,300
No!

1519
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:33,280
They were, first of all, they were like, oh my gosh, This is like, what?

1520
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:34,840
Why?

1521
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:46,480
This is, this, this old person is pro is doing this, this voice for this, what the hell?

1522
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,280
Then also mysburger.

1523
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:56,600
Gosh, that's such a, I was like, ooh.

1524
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,400
Yowch.

1525
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:00,960
That hurt.

1526
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,100
Get it off.

1527
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:03,860
Angler, you've caught me.

1528
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:05,220
I'm a magic fish.

1529
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,000
Private property is sacred.

1530
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,440
Now I belong to you.

1531
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,360
This is the beginning of your fairy tale.

1532
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:11,740
Want to see how it goes?

1533
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,400
Gut it.

1534
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,180
Not so fast.

1535
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:18,080
Okay, now we learned.

1536
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,040
He just poofs away every time.

1537
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:23,280
Yeah, you poof every time.

1538
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,000
You tried to gut me?

1539
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,600
But I told you I'm magical that it's a fairy tale and all that.

1540
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:30,580
Are you an idiot?

1541
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:36,830
My name is Ka- Uglyuso.

1542
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:40,590
Magic fish, sea vet, and giver of advice.

1543
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:42,550
The illusion of choice.

1544
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:45,910
But then what?

1545
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:51,450
Maybe we gut him, and then we get the phone call that gives us the 45 minutes, and then we just fail.

1546
01:39:58,010 --> 01:39:59,710
Okay, once I'm out of this.

1547
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:01,330
Oh, wait, I can still.

1548
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:01,970
Me and Nanyo.

1549
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,210
Ah!

1550
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,850
Damn, you wear it well.

1551
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:08,830
Oh, the- The text is still there.

1552
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:13,710
He's not a puffer fish.

1553
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,070
He's a poofer fish.

1554
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:20,570
That's what I say whenever my cat sees something that gets her freaked out.

1555
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:22,430
I say she's all poofed.

1556
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:25,370
I'm like, what's got you poofed, girl?

1557
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:26,630
What's got you poofed?

1558
01:40:28,490 --> 01:40:30,330
Time-saving strat.

1559
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:36,130
Call me the beater, the beta tester.

1560
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:53,990

1562
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:11,200
because i don't remember how it goes at all

1563
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:23,410
Never have been to this town, feel a little down.

1564
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:28,570
The friends told me the news, the news.

1565
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:31,110
You said you don't move, move, move, move.

1566
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:33,910
This is why they're good at building a shop.

1567
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:36,170
Build the parts, bolts, and screws.

1568
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:37,750
Instead, I've been walking on air.

1569
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:40,490
This hair is so excited.

1570
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:41,510
I don't really care.

1571
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:43,730
We're just so since last June.

1572
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:47,370
How happy I'm just to be alive?

1573
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:48,350
I'm not alive.

1574
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:51,530
We inside, well I hope they open to...

1575
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:53,010
I can't wait.

1576
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:55,030
I can't wait.

1577
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:58,270
When are they gonna open up that door?

1578
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:00,870
I'm going, yes, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1579
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:01,830
I'm going to the...

1580
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:05,850
I'm going to the hardware store!

1581
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:09,050
Going to the hardware store!

1582
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,980
Let's see if I can't find the door.

1583
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:19,760
Let's see if there's a light up.

1584
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:34,160
The person who was a character to get the guys Had to be here in the night Gonna give me a flashlight, room, and a pair of pliers I'm convinced the person singing this is also not Oh, but I souls?

1585
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,260
This person is not singing the lyrics

1586
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,360
This person is not singing the lyrics

1587
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:53,860
I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait When are they gonna open up that door?

1590
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,250
Why did you send me the TikTok?

1591
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,040
Oh, this is a good movie.

1592
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:32,360
It was a watch.

1593
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,540
Toggy talk, my wires look at this.

1594
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:37,000
I mean, you know, so many details, brother-in-law, sent the two-point room and pick-and-handless coonie with letters.

1595
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:37,560
I understand.

1596
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,720
What is, what is the fairly odd pair?

1597
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:43,580
One strip and jump came as hunk and table and the ground table and ladles.

1598

Really?

1601
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:52,070
Perfect first try.

1602
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:53,910
Why am I lagging so much today?

1603
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:58,250
Oh, maybe I have too much stuff open.

1604
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:03,500
Hardware store.

1605
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,180
I thought it was the game, but it's just me.

1606
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:09,860
I'm lagging.

1607
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,540
It's the hat.

1608
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,580
Yeah, it's the hat.

1609
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,900
I wonder if they have fairly odd parents on here.

1610
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,460
Song called Albuquerque.

1611
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,700
Wait, I think I know that one.

1612
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:27,900
Oh, wait, they actually do.

1613
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,440
This is crazy.

1614
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:36,040
Timmy is an average kid, but no one understands.

1615
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:41,120
Mom and Dad and Vicky always giving him commands.

1616
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:45,740
Doom and gloom up in his room is broken instantly.

1617
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:48,960
Buy his magic little fish and grant his every wish.

1618
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:54,140
Cause in reality they are his odd parents, fairly odd parents.

1619
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,180
Wants and wings?

1620
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,060
Odd parents, fairly odd parents.

1621
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:01,580
Really odd pea pod, love pod, hot rod.

1622
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:06,800
Octus, rubber goose, green moose, jowl shoes, giant snake, birthday cake, large french, chocolate shakes.

1623
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,400
Who the hell just interrupted my rap?

1624
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Obtuse, rubber goose, green moose, wabajous, giant snake, birthday cake, large fries, chocolate shake!

1625
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:34,530

01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:40,210

1627
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:40,550
Huh?

1628
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:42,250
Hmm?

1629
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,220
She sounds just like him.

1630
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:50,640
Danny Phantom?

1631
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:51,800
That's a good one.

1632
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,140
Suddenly karaoke.

1633
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,360
No, they don't have it on here.

1634
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,480
Hold on, I'll find it.

1635
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:01,960
The stream is already dead.

1636
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:03,520
It's already got and got.

1637
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:04,820
What's it called?

1638
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:06,260
Uh.

1639
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:08,500
Uh.

1640
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:09,740
Oh, Danny.

1641
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:10,840
Phantom.

1642
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,120
Then I'm going to go after this.

1643
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:16,300
I actually have a meeting.

1644
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:22,070
But it's Japan time, so it's so late for me.

1645
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:24,720
Oh, pain meds make me drowsy.

1646
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:25,440
Good night!

1647
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,380
So, um, what is this?

1648
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:31,590
Oh, here we go.

1649
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,760
Does this have lyrics?

1650
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,060
Oh, damn it.

1651
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:39,520
Where does it start?

1652
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,300
Wait, when does it start?

1653
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,580
Apparently, look inside of it.

1654
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:53,580
It was a great big flash.

1655
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:54,600
Everything just changed.

1656
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:56,640
His molecules got all rearranged.

1657
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:57,980
Phantom, phantom.

1658
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:02,140
Did you realize he had growing green eyes?

1659
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:07,480
It was the had to do.

1660
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:09,540
He had to stop all the ghosts that were coming through.

1661
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,640
He's here to fight for me and you.

1662
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:19,380
Gotta catch him all cuz he's Danny Phantom Gotta catch him all cuz he's Danny Phantom Gotta catch him all cuz he's Danny Phantom Where did it start?

1663
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:24,990
When does the song start?

1664
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:28,330
I thought it would like cue me in or something

1665
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:34,650
He's a phantom.

1666
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:36,670
Okay, I think I remember now.

1667
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:37,670
Danny Phantom.

1668
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:51,590

01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:20,570
Maybe.

1673
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,210
Daddy Fat Top.

1674
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:25,350
Snake Eater.

1675
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:31,470

And shorter stream.

1677
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:37,630
I think my computer needs a reset because I'm all laggy.

1678
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:43,230
But I had so much fun and I hope you guys liked seeing lilac a little bit.

1679
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:46,990
Look, you can even see the bags under my eyes.

1680
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:47,730
Pink!

1681
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:51,210

I'm sorry.

1685
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:06,560

And I had a lot of fun.

1690
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,500
And this was silly.

1691
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,660
I just wanted to play a kind of creepy game.

1692
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:25,880
Mike doesn't say that amount.

1693
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,400
Mine says less than that.

1694
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,760
Where are you guys getting your numbers from?

1695
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,160
I'm the poofer.

1696
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:35,980
Good night, Minky.

Otsubito.

1700
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:45,270
Itta-it-a-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai.
