1
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,680
Loyalty to the Khan.

2
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,820
Loyalty to the Khan.

3
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,670
I didn't check.

4
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,470
Oh my god, I have to lower it even more.

5
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,040
Like that.

6
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,500
Oh my god, it's so loud.

7
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
This is the loudest game ever.

8
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,460
It's so loud.

9
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wait, okay.

10
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,500
Today's stream is incredibly scuffed.

11
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
Because my...

12
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,760
This game just broke my computer.

13
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,740
And it thinks that my left monitor is on the right.

14
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,700
And so I have to think about when I want to go over to my right monitor.

15
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,660
I have to go to the left.

16
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,360
And I just had this...

17
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,300
Okay, and also the game is so tiny for me.

18
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,940
But I just had a genius moment.

19
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,820
I'm gonna play through OBS.

20
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,700
Then I can scale it.

21
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Oh my god, I can see the game.

22
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,700
I might be a genius.

23
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,460
Oh wait, no I can't.

24
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,080
I don't think this game is played with controller.

25
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
It seems like this game is played with mouse and keyboard.

26
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,340
It's keyboard only?

27
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,900
Okay, nevermind.

28
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,660
I have to play it really tiny.

29
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,500
It's like the size of my thumb.

30
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,260
It's so small.

31
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
I've been having issues with my...

32
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,300
With my... What's it called?

33
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,240
My monitors.

34
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,440
And so I don't want to change the resolution because only just today did they start getting a little bit...

35
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,520
Maybe not messed up.

36
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,760
I can still play looking at OBS, maybe.

37
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,240
The 4K life.

38
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,260
Don't upgrade to 4K monitors, you guys.

39
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,140
Don't do it.

40
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,060
Don't do it.

41
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,880
You'll regret it.

42
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,320
Don't... You don't need to see in 4K.

43
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,440
The human eyes was not meant for this.

44
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,180
Don't do it.

45
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,900
It's only made my afterlife miserable.

46
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,430
Don't do it.

47
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,730
But also I did it because I wanted pink monitors.

48
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,090
I got to meet David Hayter yesterday.

49
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,810
He was indeed pretty good.

50
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,150
He's such a nice guy.

51
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,010
He's so silly.

52
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,270
I wanted to try mentioning this once more.

53
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,830
You can try Windows Power Toys crop and lock.

54
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,510
I don't have that.

55
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,330
I do not have that, unfortunately.

56
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,510
But also if I touch the window...

57
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,450
Look how big my cursor is.

58
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,510
If I touch the window, like if I try to make it bigger or anything...

59
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,970
Wait, why isn't it moving?

60
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,650
My cursor.

61
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,410
That's weird.

62
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:34,450
That's weird.

63
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,290
If I... What's the word?

64
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,070
Oh, if I make it bigger, it ruins it.

65
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,050
Spank!

66
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,430
Thank you for the haka so far!

67
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,210
Too late.

68
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,150
Already 4K.

69
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,850
Here's some love for Metal Gear Solid.

70
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,810
Thank you!

71
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,930
Your cursor is moving though?

72
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,770
No, no.

73
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,230
I meant like... It's supposed to be dancing.

74
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,990
Me dancing.

75
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,530
I can just paint the housing for a regular monitor.

76
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,090
No!

77
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,570
No!

78
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,710
No!

79
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,910
No!

80
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,850
No!

81
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,370
Bad!

82
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,010
No!

83
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:16,910
No!

84
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:17,670
No!

85
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,350
You can't!

86
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,890
No!

87
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:19,610
No!

88
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,250
It has to be all over pink!

89
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,670
No!

90
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:24,870
No!

91
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,310
What do you mean paint?

92
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,730
Who does that?

93
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,010
What do you want it to look like?

94
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,150
Oh my gosh, it would look horrible.

95
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,390
No!

96
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:35,910
No!

97
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,470
I wanted pink monitors!

98
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,510
Anyway, I'm not here to complain.

99
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,490
We're here to game.

100
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,810
Merry Gear Solid.

101
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,070
I'll stop complaining about the size, I think.

102
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,430
Windows has a magnifier feature.

103
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,570
I don't think you understand how broken my computer is right now at this very moment.

104
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,110
So I don't want to do anything more.

105
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,390
I had to already restart it like three times, okay?

106
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,390
So, please.

107
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,020
F it, we ball.

108
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah, baby!

109
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Let's try.

110
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,960
Let's do a new game.

111
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,240
Oh, enter?

112
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,140
Okay.

113
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,140
Oh my god.

114
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,280
Shift?

115
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,100
Nothing equipped.

116
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,180
You can make distractions by...

117
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,280
Oh, hugging a wall and pressing control.

118
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,980
Look at me, I'm Santa!

119
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,440
Control.

120
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,960
What am I doing?

121
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,760
Oh, I'm knocking.

122
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Is it a birthday?

123
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,540
Yesterday was my 30th birthday.

124
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,160
When the mint plush comes I'm going to take her to eat some yummy cake to celebrate.

125
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,880
Oh my gosh, it might be a mint though.

126
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,740
Happy birthday, Merry Baby!

127
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,860
Happy birthday to you.

128
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,060
Happy birthday to you.

129
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,200
Happy birthday, Merry Baby.

130
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,300
Always and forever a baby.

131
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,340
Happy birthday!

132
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,900
Okay, I think we are getting timed, right?

133
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
I don't care about...

134
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,900
There is voice acting in this?

135
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,240
Tiny Tim?

136
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,640
Ebenezer E?

137
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,380
Military surveillance crafts have been circling the skies in response to the 9-11 attack 6 years ago.

138
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:53,940
What?

139
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
6 years ago?

140
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:55,840
Why?

141
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,260
The traditional way.

142
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,880
We can't risk having you spotted soaring through the sky on a sleigh.

143
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,560
With the nation on high alert as it is, there's far too great of a chance you'll be branded a national threat.

144
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,180
So that's why I'll be delivering gifts by foot I presume?

145
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,340
Precisely.

146
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,860
This is a top secret covert mission.

147
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,980
From this point on, we'll be referring to each other by code name.

148
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,520
Major Tim!

149
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,940
Solid Santa!

150
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,980
What is happening?

151
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,560
Top most floor.

152
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:34,700
Why?

153
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,100
Not the naughty children!

154
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,720
This is a stealth mission.

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,440
You must not be discovered or the mission will be a failure.

156
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,800
Do whatever it takes to stay out of the enemy's field of vision.

157
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,660
To make things easier, you'll need to make use of any tools you find in the house.

158
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,240
I'll be giving you advice and instructions via codec.

159
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,900
My frequency is 012.25.

160
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,980
Commencing Operation Secret Santa.

161
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,060
What's this?

162
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,040
What is...

163
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,140
OK, I have to look through OBS I think.

164
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,340
Maybe I... OK, let me try...

165
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,780
Hold on.

166
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,120
Oh, to the left?

167
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,540
Take it back now, y'all.

168
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,180
Windowed projector.

169
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,660
To the right.

170
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,080
Maybe if I watch through the window, it will be fine.

171
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:39,940
OK.

172
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,640
Oh, sorry.

173
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
One hop this time.

174
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,820
Alright, we're Santa, baby.

175
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,300
Yeah, they're asleep.

176
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,220
Oh, a trap?

177
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,820
Hugging walls.

178
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,380
Hugging walls.

179
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,580
I think this music might drive me crazy.

180
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,080
Oh my god!

181
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,020
Oh my god, Naughty Child.

182
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,560
What is this game?

183
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,080
You were discovered!

184
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,160
Guys, I'm not gonna make it.

185
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,100
How does this kid have such good vision?

186
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,740
How do I run faster?

187
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,700
Santa Claus.

188
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,500
Santa Claus.

189
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,860
How do I get around this kid?

190
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,580
He's gonna see me for sure.

191
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,240
This game is on European extreme difficulty.

192
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,240
Actually though...

193
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,940
OK, hold on.

194
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,100
Alright, once he leaves...

195
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,520
Go!

196
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,520
Oh my gosh, how am I supposed to...

197
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,400
Oh my god.

198
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,340
Wait, so all he does is run up to the wall...

199
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,900
and then waits for Santa again?

200
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,840
I have nothing.

201
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,680
I can't...

202
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,200
I wish I could punch him.

203
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,880
I have nothing.

204
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,800
Wait, what's the controls on this anyway?

205
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,740
C...

206
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,000
Z...

207
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,120
F...

208
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,820
C...

209
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,860
Q...

210
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,500
R...

211
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,280
S...

212
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,620
G...

213
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:41,960
Nothing.

214
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,960
Nothing works.

215
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,640
Wait, space?

216
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,340
Nothing works.

217
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,440
Just a box.

218
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,780
Oh my god, just a present!

219
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,280
Just a present!

220
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,780
You can't punch kids.

221
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,440
Why can't I punch the child?

222
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,300
Why?

223
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,120
Are you gonna play Merry Gear Solid 2?

224
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,680
We'll see how I feel after this.

225
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,700
We'll see how I am after this, you know.

226
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,840
Oh my god.

227
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,800
Where's Santa Claus?

228
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,820
Mommy, does Santa exist?

229
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,260
Santa Claus!

230
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,010
Mommy, does Santa exist?

231
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,330
How good is this kid's vision?

232
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,540
These dead kids!

233
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,880
Santa Claus!

234
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,360
I can't!

235
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,800
I can't with these children!

236
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,460
Santa Claus!

237
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,280
Oh my god.

238
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,040
We made it.

239
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,360
We made it, baby.

240
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,380
We made it.

241
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,060
We made it.

242
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,860
Oh, this is not a door we can go through.

243
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,140
We can only go upstairs.

244
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,960
We made it!

245
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,840
What is this?

246
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,730
Oh my god.

247
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,210
Wait, how do I...

248
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,850
Do you think I just run for it?

249
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,450
How many children are in this place?

250
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,430
How many kids do these people have?

251
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,330
How do I do this?

252
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,390
Just walk?

253
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,610
Santa Claus!

254
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,630
Mommy, does Santa exist?

255
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,050
Santa Claus!

256
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,350
Oh, it starts me at the second story though.

257
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,350
Ok, that's not so bad.

258
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,650
What if I knock?

259
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,670
Oh, I'm going to get discovered.

260
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,590
How am I supposed to do this?

261
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,830
How?

262
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,190
Ok.

263
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,470
So they can only see what's in front of them.

264
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,930
Ok, that's not so bad then.

265
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,770
Ok, ok.

266
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,190
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

267
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,630
Ok, ok, ok.

268
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,350
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

269
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,290
We got the gaps.

270
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,210
Yeah, straight line of sight.

271
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,130
It's not a cone.

272
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,410
It's not a cone like we are used to.

273
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,490
Fat air?

274
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,490
Fat air?

275
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,550
Thank you Amanda for the support.

276
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,390
Thank you Amanda!

277
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,250
Thanks for dropping by!

278
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,750
Amanda is one of the bosses.

279
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,290
One of the big bosses of MGSCon.

280
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,110
Which MGSCon is doing a Kickstarter.

281
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,790
Everybody, link in the description.

282
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,410
The boss, the boss.

283
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,850
The big boss.

284
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,850
Don't forget four sons spinning the hallways.

285
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,610
It's so funny.

286
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,050
Where should we...

287
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,890
I don't know where to knock.

288
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,170
Oh...

289
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,110
Where?

290
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,510
I don't want him to see me.

291
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,930
Where is the door?

292
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,710
Nice.

293
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,350
The third story.

294
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,290
East wing?

295
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,170
No...

296
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,590
I know there is no easy way past this one.

297
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,030
My Christmas spirit?

298
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,870
Telekinesis?

299
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,050
What?

300
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,430
What's the catch?

301
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,750
TV...

302
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,030
You know this is old because otherwise it would be like...

303
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,630
It would be like...

304
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,610
You just summoned TikTok or something.

305
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,110
What happens if I do it?

306
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,030
I was clicking OBS, my bad.

307
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,530
How long does it last?

308
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,930
I can't turn it off.

309
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,030
He did say that, didn't he?

310
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,390
I think I wasted it.

311
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,740
I think I wasted it because now I can't get past this.

312
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,120
I can't get past this one kid.

313
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,680
Oopsie!

314
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,480
Catch me kid!

315
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,540
It's too much.

316
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Who made this?

317
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,340
Why?

318
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,540
For what reason?

319
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:09,940
OK.

320
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,380
Oh, I'm clicking the OBS again.

321
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,820
Oh my gosh.

322
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,260
Run!

323
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:16,980
What's this?

324
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,800
OK, it's just a little area to hide in.

325
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,920
Alright, we got the west wing everybody.

326
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,520
What?

327
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,620
Is this a present?

328
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,620
I got a gift!

329
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
Thank you for the hotdog!

330
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,220
Thank you so much!

331
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,020
Air holes?

332
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,060
No way!

333
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,620
Just a box!

334
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,060
Oh my gosh, we are going to be a present!

335
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,680
Are you guys feeling the Christmas spirit here?

336
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,620
Oh!

337
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,500
What?

338
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,600
It's just Christmas, you know.

339
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,180
It's just how it is, you know, Christmas stuff.

340
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,680
Just Christmas things, you know.

341
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,720
Oh my god, look how cute we are!

342
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,940
Try frequency... How do I get to codec?

343
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,700
I don't think I can just regularly codec them, can I?

344
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,680
OK.

345
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,540
Red light!

346
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,320
Green light!

347
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,720
Red light!

348
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,060
Green light!

349
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,940
Red light!

350
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,840
Green light!

351
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,600
Red light!

352
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,760
Green light!

353
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,160
Nice.

354
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,560
We are awesome.

355
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,600
We are so good at this game.

356
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,110
Shift!

357
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,530
He's not going to care.

358
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,570
He's not going to notice me.

359
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,530
OK.

360
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,310
Does he walk right...What if he walks on top of me?

361
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,150
He's not going to do that.

362
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,510
See guys!

363
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:34,830
Easy.

364
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,530
Oh no.

365
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,470
Wait, this looks like a room with lasers.

366
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,450
We'll come back.

367
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,650
I need the item over there.

368
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:48,910
I see.

369
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,630
What if I go through too?

370
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,510
What if I go through?

371
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,090
Santa!

372
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,210
Don't step there!

373
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,490
Wait, don't take another step.

374
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,330
You're going to set off an alarm.

375
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,850
Who are you?

376
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,590
Let's just say I'm your number one fan.

377
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,170
Call me Santa's Little Helper.

378
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,270
Santa's Little Helper?

379
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,470
How do I know I can believe what you're saying?

380
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:25,650
You don't have to believe anything, but if you want to get out of this mission unnoticed, you don't have much of a choice.

381
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,610
So maybe it's just best if you believe what I say.

382
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,150
Well, seeing is believing.

383
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,590
And I don't see any alarm systems here, so I don't believe a single thing you're saying either.

384
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:41,430
If you can only believe in the things that you can see, you're going to be a very unhappy man.

385
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,670
What do you mean?

386
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,850
Well, can you see gravity?

387
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:45,670
No.

388
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,250
Yes.

389
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,210
You mean we can kind of.

390
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,350
You wouldn't believe in it.

391
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,330
And if you don't believe in it, you'd be floating around.

392
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,350
But we can see things falling.

393
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,370
You said you don't believe in it, but you're not floating.

394
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,050
You're just being a hypocrite.

395
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,250
Nobody likes hypocrites.

396
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,730
Get called out, Santa.

397
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,010
And that's why you're going to be a very unhappy man.

398
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,390
I guess you're right.

399
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,370
I believe you.

400
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,270
This alarm system is set to go off if you touch its infrared laser meter.

401
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,070
Santa's a little helper.

402
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,210
I didn't know you were in the game.

403
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,850
So how am I supposed to get past it?

404
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,030
I'll let you figure that out by yourself.

405
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,410
No!

406
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,330
For someone named Santa's little helper, you sure don't help that much.

407
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,890
I'm a little helper.

408
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,970
I'm a big helper.

409
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,470
Oh god, we're gonna die to the kid.

410
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,270
Oh shoot.

411
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,090
What?

412
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:35,750
Wait.

413
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,290
I thought they could only see...

414
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,630
I thought they only saw what was right in front of them.

415
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:41,930
No way.

416
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,010
OK, interesting.

417
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,850
Santa Claus.

418
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,630
I think he hugs this wall, so I think we can go into the corner.

419
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,490
And we'll be fine.

420
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,070
Santa Claus.

421
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,720
What did we get?

422
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,980
Oh we got a candy cane?

423
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,360
Is that a sea cane?

424
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
We can ring their necks!

425
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,560
Read the wrapper.

426
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,620
But you're welcome to membership.

427
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,360
Thank you.

428
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,440
A what?

429
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,780
Seas candy.

430
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,680
No,

431
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,040
you have to believe Santa!

432
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,940
They think kids shouldn't believe in Santa.

433
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,480
Right!

434
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,080
OK.

435
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,560
Sorry, every time the codex ends I try to...

436
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,980
Oh wow, we're huffing and puffing.

437
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,500
I try to turn the music up and down.

438
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,620
Because it's so loud.

439
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,880
But the voices are kind of soft.

440
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,740
OK,

441
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,540
candy cane.

442
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:26,800
Candy cane.

443
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,500
Do these change?

444
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,820
No, it doesn't look like it.

445
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,400
Gosh, I'm so used to...

446
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,500
So used to other Metal Gears, right?

447
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,460
Doesn't Santa smoke a pipe?

448
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,420
Yeah, you're right!

449
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,100
He does!

450
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,480
Is that a little... What is this?

451
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,080
What's this on the floor?

452
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,430
Uh oh.

453
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,510
Why is there a pile of coals on the ground?

454
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,670
The ghost of Christmas Babble.

455
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,350
No way!

456
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,270
I said follow your footsteps, not follow in your footsteps, you idiot.

457
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,210
This is kind of... This is not a good dialogue.

458
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,970
They're funny.

459
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,310
They're pretty funny.

460
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,750
Wait, I think I need my huffer puffer.

461
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:45,690
OK.

462
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,410
Good thing this kid is not noticing any of the smoke.

463
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:50,790
Mommy!

464
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,370
Fire!

465
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,370
Mommy!

466
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,010
Stop, drop and roll!

467
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,290
OK.

468
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,790
We're gonna leave behind footprints.

469
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,710
And I know which way we need to go.

470
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,690
Does

471
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,290
the coal last?

472
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,370
How long does the coal last for?

473
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,030
Do you think he comes down?

474
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,590
OK, I'm gonna go for it.

475
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,210
Oh my god, this kid is still following me.

476
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,910
Kid!

477
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,670
Leave me alone, please!

478
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,930
TV!

479
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,730
I got something.

480
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:49,090
Oh my god, I'm blinding the children.

481
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:00,990
Oh.

482
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,730
Oh yeah, we're blinding the children!

483
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,030
OK.

484
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:11,330
Why?

485
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,610
Oh no!

486
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,610
Put them on the naughty list.

487
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,710
That's what we'll do with them.

488
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,170
We're gonna put them on the naughty list.

489
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,990
That's what we'll do.

490
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,830
I got a gun!

491
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,230
A Nerf gun!

492
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,550
Film, but it's digital.

493
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,550
Don't worry about it.

494
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,270
OK.

495
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,810
Oh no!

496
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,750
Oh perfect!

497
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,670
You're Santa!

498
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,110
Yeah,

499
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,570
kids.

500
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,910
You were supposed to be in bed.

501
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,670
OK, wait, so...

502
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,730
A Nerf Maverick REV6.

503
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,010
Hold down CTRL to look down the sights.

504
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,930
How did he save me?

505
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,150
Santa Claus!

506
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,050
How did he save me?

507
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,910
Maybe I have to be fast.

508
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,430
Good night, children.

509
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,890
Santa Claus!

510
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,610
Oh, I bumped into him.

511
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,470
I guess that is how it happened, huh?

512
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,730
Oh my god!

513
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,170
There's so many kids!

514
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,010
Why are there so many kids?

515
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,950
And they're patrolling?

516
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,180
I see.

517
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,140
So, press CTRL to place on the ground.

518
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,360
Press again to take a photo.

519
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,460
The camera will automatically go off if an enemy gets too close.

520
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,580
OK.

521
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,420
Oh my god.

522
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,120
Oh, good thing I checked.

523
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,000
Good thing I checked.

524
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
Why are there so many children here?

525
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,740
How do I get through here, actually?

526
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,900
Do I have to... I think I have to put one of the kids to sleep.

527
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,000
And then go...

528
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,620
Wait, can they see past the trees?

529
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
Oh, I guess not.

530
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,000
Because I can... It looks like it acts like a wall, so...

531
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,200
OK.

532
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,540
CTRL...

533
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,860
Oh, SHIFT.

534
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,260
My bad.

535
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:53,900
SHIFT.

536
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,600
Gun.

537
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,140
I think we need to take out these kids.

538
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,120
How do I want to do this?

539
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,580
Oh, I think I know what I want to do.

540
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,040
I think I'm going to put a camera...

541
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,740
here.

542
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,680
And then... Oh, maybe that didn't work.

543
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,680
Wait, how long does this last?

544
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,640
Wait, hold on.

545
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,160
Wait.

546
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,740
Gun.

547
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,520
I might be in trouble.

548
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Where are these presents under the tree?

549
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,460
These poor kids.

550
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,380
What are you talking about?

551
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,100
I'm trying to be... Send them Christmas cheer and they're...

552
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,240
OK.

553
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,200
I think I might have had the right idea.

554
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,420
Maybe.

555
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,960
I'm not quite sure.

556
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,520
OK.

557
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,240
Now, get my gun ready.

558
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:08,490
OK.

559
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:09,930
Now...

560
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:11,770
Wait.

561
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,410
Take this kid down?

562
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,650
Hello?

563
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,550
Oh, there we go.

564
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,750
Nice.

565
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,390
And now I go.

566
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,690
No!

567
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,310
No way!

568
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,180
Oh my gosh.

569
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,620
Let's wait for these kids to come back through.

570
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,140
I don't know why it wasn't... tranquilizing the kids though.

571
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,740
Maybe we're thanks to the vibe gifted.

572
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,350
OK.

573
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:56,810
There we go.

574
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,050
Oh!

575
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,410
I see.

576
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:03,710
I see.

577
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,470
He turns around.

578
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,230
OK.

579
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,110
I'm going to present.

580
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,730
Tis the season.

581
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,530
Gotta ask.

582
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,890
How old were you when you found out that I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus was about Daddy dressed as Santa Claus the whole time?

583
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:19,650
No.

584
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,400
If it was... If that were the case, it would be called I saw Mommy kissing my Dad dressed up as Santa Claus.

585
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,040
What are you talking about?

586
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,040
God, this kid can see?

587
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,920
OK.

588
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,040
I didn't realize he would see me from all the way down there too.

589
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,700
I thought I was far away enough, I'll be honest.

590
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,460
Yeah.

591
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,620
What you're talking about is... not real.

592
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,520
Oh gosh.

593
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,380
I messed up.

594
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,020
Fuck off.

595
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,660
I messed up everybody.

596
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,380
Oh wait, wrong way.

597
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,700
We made it?

598
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,420
We made it somehow?

599
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,420
OK, I'm a gift.

600
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,920
Oh what?

601
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,540
Oh my god.

602
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,600
Sometimes the kids can only see straight in front of them and sometimes it's a con.

603
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,900
Oh my gosh, how am I supposed to get this kid?

604
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,790
They wouldn't write a song about Santa NTR.

605
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,730
That's what...

606
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,540
Nerf him from afar?

607
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,580
I think I have to when he's turned around.

608
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,140
Oh, oh, oh!

609
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,340
I don't need to tranquilize them.

610
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,660
I can just walk right over them.

611
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,060
OK, turn around.

612
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,620
Nice.

613
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,580
Nighty night kid.

614
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,760
Alright.

615
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,580
Tell those kids to go to sleep or Santa will...

616
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,880
Santa will visit their mother and give her a kid she'll actually love.

617
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,000
Oh my god, Nilf!

618
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,680
Oh my god,

619
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,740
Nilf!

620
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,100
OK!

621
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Nilf doesn't want to just...

622
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,520
Nilf doesn't want to just...

623
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,980
Nilf wants to cause trauma to the children.

624
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,280
Oh my god.

625
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,400
Not just to put them on the naughty list.

626
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,780
I don't know.

627
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,020
Oh the...

628
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,080
Oh wait, I want to be here.

629
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,300
OK.

630
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm just going for now.

631
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,360
I'm just... I don't know what I'm doing for now.

632
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,040
What?

633
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,760
These kids!

634
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,840
Oh my gosh, these kids are insane!

635
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,100
Don't you want to be a pretty good child on the nice list?

636
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,400
Yeah, right!

637
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,560
Wait!

638
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,820
Oh, I see kind of an issue here.

639
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,460
OK, hold on.

640
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,800
OK, hold on.

641
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,820
Let's test this.

642
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,540
OK, so they all look up.

643
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:02,840
OK.

644
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,020
Let me get caught now.

645
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:05,900
OK.

646
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,380
She won't get foxhound rank at this rate.

647
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,780
No, it would be reindeer rank.

648
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,750
But then there's the lasers here.

649
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,710
So I don't think I need to go around.

650
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,130
Right?

651
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:35,750
Hold on.

652
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,390
Candy can, that's right.

653
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,470
Yeah, there's lasers there, so going around would be kind of silly.

654
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,730
How do I do this part?

655
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,750
If I put a camera...

656
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,650
Oh, OK.

657
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,770
These kids have like 30-20 vision.

658
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,790
Funs against eagle-eyed kids.

659
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,350
When I was a kid, I had to get glasses.

660
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,550
I can't relate to these new...

661
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,770
Oh my god.

662
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,630
OK, it's right there.

663
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,650
I can't relate to these children that are...

664
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,450
That have this newfound vision.

665
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,110
Oh my god, only...

666
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,530
But how is that one kid able to see me?

667
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,210
This game, I can't.

668
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,810
OK, so that didn't work.

669
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,430
I like that it's kind of puzzly, you know?

670
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,750
Maybe I do... I guess I have to go around.

671
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,650
But...

672
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,570
I guess I have to go around.

673
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,270
Hug the wall near them?

674
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,650
Oh, and place it like that?

675
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,170
Let's see.

676
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,830
You cannot walk and hug the wall at the same time.

677
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,290
How long does the trank last?

678
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,130
I don't know, because they definitely get up.

679
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,630
OK, we'll wait for this kid.

680
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,500
Oh wait, this kid, we need to be a gift.

681
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:19,800
Nothing?

682
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,380
Santa Claus!

683
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,980
If I had moved he would have caught me anyway.

684
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,340
God, these kids.

685
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,940
Yeah, we'll definitely want to trank that guy.

686
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
This one I think is... I feel like I have to go really...

687
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,800
Really fast.

688
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,000
Like I have to distract them with a knock or something?

689
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,700
And then I have to go like...

690
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,280
Hello, fast, all the way back around or something.

691
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,240
I have to...

692
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,140
How do I do it?

693
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,420
Wait.

694
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,180
So I think I have to go around.

695
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,460
I have to trankolize all three of these kids.

696
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,640
On the left.

697
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,160
But then...

698
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,720
And then I use the TV and then I go through.

699
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,280
That's what I think I have to do.

700
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,000
Oh my gosh.

701
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,520
It's so...

702
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,740
Fast.

703
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,400
Stinking... This stinking kid up here.

704
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,160
Set up a flashbang.

705
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,280
Or I could do that.

706
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,640
Yeah, we could put the flashbang and then run by...

707
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,260
When they are like...

708
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,320
My eyes!

709
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,460
Oh wait.

710
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,140
No, wait.

711
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:46,920
How does that... Wait.

712
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,680
When I turn on the TV, all the kids will look up.

713
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,840
How do I run through?

714
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:00,890
My eyes!

715
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:10,290
Let's become a present.

716
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,260
I'm scared to move.

717
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,600
I can't see where he is.

718
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,540
Okay, there he is.

719
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,250
Does he go over anymore?

720
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:25,730
Okay.

721
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,560
Okay.

722
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,440
So from here, we set up the D camera.

723
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,630
I'm a gift.

724
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,470
I'm a simple present.

725
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,910
I'm just a little guy.

726
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,010
Those are some tall kids.

727
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,070
Yeah, you're right.

728
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:52,170
Okay.

729
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,310
I'm still scared.

730
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,710
I'm still scared.

731
00:44:58,890 --> 00:44:59,350
This kid.

732
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,170
Okay,

733
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:05,290
nice.

734
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,750
Nice and nice.

735
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,810
Nice and nice and nice and nice.

736
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:11,910
Okay.

737
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,310
Okay, alright.

738
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,550
Now...

739
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,330
D camera.

740
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,270
So while they are like...

741
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,230
Okay, they go...

742
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,710
We...

743
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,450
Press the TV.

744
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,610
We set up...

745
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,550
Another camera.

746
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,270
And we...

747
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,010
Have it go off.

748
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,030
Gosh, okay.

749
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,990
It didn't work!

750
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,560
It didn't work.

751
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,900
It was behind the wall.

752
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,560
How do I... There is no way for me to...

753
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,560
There is no way for me to...

754
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,200
I don't think I can knock anywhere.

755
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,200
I think I can only knock.

756
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:13,680
Let's see.

757
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,200
Maybe I can knock anywhere.

758
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,960
I swear I feel faster as a present.

759
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,980
Than as regular Santa.

760
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,160
Sorry, you can see my big ol' cursor.

761
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,440
Right up top.

762
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,490
Can you lower?

763
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,390
Lower the lower child.

764
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:47,790
I don't know.

765
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,010
Alright children, your eyes will go...

766
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,290
Knocked on the door just above the camera.

767
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,150
The one on the other side?

768
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,250
The one that I can't get to?

769
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,250
The one that...

770
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,350
Unless this...

771
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,150
The one I can't get to because there is lasers?

772
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,010
Happy Holidays Mito.

773
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:39,850
Happy Holidays!

774
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:40,710
If

775
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,920
I did that...

776
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,300
If I knocked on that door, the kids right there would turn around, would they not?

777
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,990
Get the lower kid to walk out from where he can see the camera.

778
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,290
Yeah, it's just...

779
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,750
It's just... Ooh, timing.

780
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:06,930
Timing.

781
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:07,910
OK.

782
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,630
Knock?

783
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:18,010
Knock?

784
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:22,780
This

785
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,780
is the true final boss.

786
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,870
Santa Claus!

787
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,420
I'm glad this kid is blind at least.

788
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,660
It's this kid down here that I hate.

789
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,780
I hate this guy.

790
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,900
I hate this kid.

791
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:11,130
If I decamera...

792
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,820
If I do this...

793
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,480
And then knock...

794
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,260
I don't think there is much of a...

795
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:29,770
Just...

796
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,810
Trank all three, but they do wake up.

797
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,050
They wake up kind of fast.

798
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,830
Stage is kind of annoying because you got to loop every time to try the difficult part.

799
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:45,790
I just don't know the order of operations.

800
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:51,350
Test to see if the camera takes priority.

801
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,750
True.

802
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,630
They don't even hear it.

803
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,110
Do you think they are going to notice me?

804
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,610
Oh my god.

805
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,660
Do you think he is going to notice me?

806
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,700
No, this kid is blind.

807
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,580
I love this kid.

808
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,000
He causes me no stress.

809
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,180
I don't know the words.

810
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,580
I don't know the words to this song.

811
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,260
This part I swear...

812
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,420
It's got to be like probably some super crazy timing or something.

813
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:34,690
Huh...

814
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,710
Trank those three kids after you blind them to get more time to set up.

815
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,070
You think?

816
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,200
Let's try it.

817
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,640
Oh my gosh.

818
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,120
They ran to the damn laser!

819
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,220
I was just trying to turn sideways!

820
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,360
No!

821
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,360
I don't think you need to go all the way around.

822
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,340
Just knock to lure the three kids and hit them with the camera.

823
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,220
Let's try it.

824
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,300
I have no attachment to this run.

825
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,540
Hit them with the camera then knock them out again.

826
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,300
Or knock to lure the other two.

827
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:53,740
I

828
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,860
don't...I don't know.

829
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,940
We'll see.

830
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,340
Oh it's only the one.

831
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,560
I can't go any higher than that.

832
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,460
I can't go any higher.

833
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,000
Oh my god.

834
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,760
I blinded two.

835
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,860
Yeah, I blinded two, but how am I gonna get the...

836
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,800
The last...The one in the middle probably wouldn't notice me.

837
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,600
It's the one that's on the bottom that's the issue.

838
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:49,760
Dude!

839
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,500
Thanks for the raid!

840
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,780
Hi everybody!

841
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,580
We're playing Christmas Metal Gear.

842
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,860
OK, hold on.

843
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,220
Oh I can go...Wait.

844
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,860
I don't think...

845
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,020
Let's see.

846
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,940
So I can only go up to here.

847
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,700
Let me take them out.

848
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,360
Say goodnight kid.

849
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,260
Oh that's the camera!

850
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:32,900
Anyway...

851
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,780
That kid up there sees me!

852
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,560
OK, wait.

853
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,240
OK, hold on.

854
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,320
Because also I can go up here.

855
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,160
Maybe if I go up here and knock it would be better.

856
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,520
OK, I'm gonna leave the camera here.

857
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,940
I'm gonna go up here and we're gonna knock here.

858
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,380
Oh!

859
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,520
I killed all three of them!

860
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,860
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

861
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,590
Please!

862
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:11,150
No!

863
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,410
I keep switching to the camera!

864
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,570
Wait, I can't get the last kid.

865
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:18,770
Maybe I can.

866
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,230
I think I missed my chance.

867
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:28,030
OK, so that's what I have to...Oh my god, they're awake for such a little amount of time.

868
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,470
OK, that's what I gotta do.

869
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,390
OK, we know what we gotta do.

870
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,490
Then TV...OK, OK, OK.

871
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,430
OK, we know what we gotta do.

872
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:37,910
OK, OK.

873
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,790
I just gotta not mess it up.

874
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,420
Switch to camera.

875
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,980
Then switch to gun.

876
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,100
TV, TV, TV!

877
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,220
The

878
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,210
Christmas tree!

879
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,190
Can I leave?

880
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:16,930
Wait.

881
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,730
We made it!

882
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:26,390
Good.

883
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:27,910
Now get out of there.

884
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,170
Are you kidding me?

885
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,790
Now I have to do it backwards.

886
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,970
Yes, I have to artificially extend playtime somehow.

887
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:34,650
No way!

888
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,630
Oh, wow, excuse me.

889
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,450
I don't know what got into me.

890
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,610
Anyway, good luck.

891
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,450
Wait, there is a chimney right there!

892
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,450
No way!

893
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:46,330
The chimney!

894
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,290
The chimney Santa!

895
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,470
No way!

896
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,220
Wait, what?

897
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,530
USB tactical fitted with a suppressor.

898
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,230
The ideal choice for a stealth mission.

899
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,430
Aim it at someone's back to hold them up.

900
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,210
Wait, why can't I hold it?

901
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,250
Freeze!

902
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,090
Actual solid steak!

903
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,210
Oh my god, we got double crossed.

904
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:50,470
I was sent on a mission to assassinate his twin brother, Bigbeard.

905
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:58,230
You, see, you were part of the Los Bigotes Perfectos Project.

906
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,770
The Los Bigotes Perfectos Project?

907
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,350
Yeah, the Los Bigotes Perfectos Project.

908
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:09,470
It was a top secret project started by Andrew Johnson back in the 19th century.

909
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,870
President Johnson was quite displeased with his lack of facial hair.

910
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:18,350
Especially after the abundant beard of his predecessor, Abraham Lincoln.

911
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:22,950
His wife started funding research on bioengineering with a perfect beard.

912
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:26,170
The research resulted in the birth of twin clones.

913
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,010
Los Bigotes Perfectos.

914
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:32,310
One of the twins received the genes for the perfect beard.

915
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,870
And this twin became known as Bigbeard.

916
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:42,370
But for Bigbeard to be created, you needed to be another twin to whom all this has changed for a good while.

917
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,570
Bigbeard is like also a... also a sibling.

918
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,170
If we have Bigbeard and Bigboss, then we also have Bigbird.

919
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,610
Oh my god.

920
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:06,490
Ooterheaven.

921
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,470
It's cut off.

922
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,650
Metal Gear!

923
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,150
Metal Gear!

924
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,710
Wait, no!

925
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:15,910
This is Mary Gear!

926
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,590
Bigbird leaves the Aerial Division.

927
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,170
Bigbeard!

928
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:41,850
No!

929
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,550
Oh, he's so... OK.

930
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,110
He's so fine with it.

931
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,730
Oh my god, no!

932
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:56,050
Santa!

933
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:05,730
Santa!

934
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:06,990
Secret Santa!

935
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,930
He killed Santa.

936
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,190
Oh my god.

937
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,430
Major Tim.

938
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,650
Solid...

939
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:24,930
What?

940
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,170
What is that?

941
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,110
What?

942
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,110
After Santa Bar?

943
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,690
Thanks to Hideo Kojima.

944
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:52,730
How does this man's name still get put into the game?

945
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,530
Even though he has nothing to do with it.

946
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,150
Bravo, Kojimba.

947
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,570
What?

948
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:06,550
The SA goods?

949
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,170
Like something awful?

950
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,330
Oh no!

951
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,800
Yes, sir.

952
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,120
Yes, sir.

953
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:41,600
No, sir.

954
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,300
Yes, sir.

955
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,640
Yes, sir.

956
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,140
That's me.

957
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,800
No, sir.

958
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,060
I've made a grave mistake.

959
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,820
Did we get the wrong guy?

960
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,800
There is multiple people going and infiltrating houses.

961
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,560
Mammoth.

962
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,200
Does that mean I'm slow?

963
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,220
OK, we get it.

964
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,640
We get it.

965
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,880
Can we sing that song in the next karaoke?

966
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,320
I think I'm good.

967
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,540
Time taken.

968
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,600
That's a lot of seconds.

969
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,480
Times discovered, 22.

970
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,940
Well, there is a second game, but isn't the second... OK, so...

971
01:02:53,940 --> 01:03:02,980
I saw that the first game, this one... I only saw like Vinny play it.

972
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:07,840
And it was like 30 minutes or 40 minutes that he took.

973
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,980
And then he played it again and it was like...

974
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,520
It was like 3 hours.

975
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,000
It was really long.

976
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,320
So I'm like, wait a second.

977
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,700
It's longer though.

978
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:41,870
Big hairy Minto with tusks is so cute.

979
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:49,410
So I'm not sure if I'm up for like a 3 hour adventure.

980
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:51,710
From what we just did.

981
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,410
All these kids look the same.

982
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:58,530
I assume they are clothes.

983
01:03:59,370 --> 01:03:59,890
Johan!

984
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,750
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gifted!

985
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,950
Thank you!

986
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:06,570
What do we want to do?

987
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,350
The genome kids.

988
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,290
Maybe for real Christmas?

989
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:25,210
We could do that, like on Christmas Eve.

990
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:30,410
I was wondering what I wanted to do that week.

991
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:36,150
So, maybe...

992
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:44,550
Watching your streams and hearing you sing gave me karaoke confidence and I sang Snow Halation at a public karaoke last night.

993
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,510
Oh my gosh, Aeon, let's go!

994
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,050
But everyone was just like, wow.

995
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:51,530
Deliver it.

996
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,910
Hope Salazana gives me Ace Combat 8.

997
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,770
I hope for you too.

998
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,700
But I don't want to end stream, it's only been an hour.

999
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,340
What do?

1000
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:11,780
What do?

1001
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,240
What do?

1002
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,780
I guess I could just talk.

1003
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,620
We could just hang out.

1004
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,000
My computer is all messed up though.

1005
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,840
Did we beat the game?

1006
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,840
We beat the game!

1007
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,360
We beat the game!

1008
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,040
No alert run?

1009
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,100
OK, let's try it.

1010
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,600
How do I skip the codex?

1011
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,960
We are speedrunning!

1012
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,860
Skip, skip, skip!

1013
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,060
Oh I got it, nice.

1014
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,460
I'm a genius.

1015
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,880
I'm a genius.

1016
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,740
Skip-a, skip-a, skip-a, skip-a.

1017
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,740
Skip-a, skip-a, skip-a, skip-a.

1018
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,180
Oh gosh, it scares me.

1019
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,170
Oh my gosh!

1020
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:11,610
We almost didn't make that you guys, but we made it!

1021
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,770
First floor!

1022
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:13,810
Down!

1023
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:16,830
Climb the ladder again.

1024
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:17,530
What a thrill.

1025
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,960
Oh wait, I'm an idiot!

1026
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,360
Guys, I'm stupid.

1027
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,440
I'm dumb.

1028
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,480
I was looking at the kid below.

1029
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,020
Instead of the kid, the run is over at the second floor!

1030
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,980
We know Minky, it's OK.

1031
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,080
Diddly diddly diddly diddly did.

1032
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,940
OK, we gotta wait for this kid too.

1033
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:19,150
OK, we are a genius at this part now.

1034
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,190
We are so good.

1035
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:23,330
Third time's the charm.

1036
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,570
I don't know, I think I'm gonna get caught again.

1037
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:29,450
I got caught so many times before.

1038
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,050
OK.

1039
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:35,890
OK.

1040
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:40,830
OK, alright.

1041
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:43,270
OK, nice.

1042
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:51,240
What was that?

1043
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,460
These kids voices are so funny.

1044
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,360
I wish it was that I could get caught sometimes.

1045
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:11,640
I wish I could get caught like...

1046
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:18,600
Like one time on each floor, you know?

1047
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,460
Once on each floor, you know?

1048
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,160
That's what I wish.

1049
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,470
Potentially get caught.

1050
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,250
How about zero times?

1051
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,570
No, I'm trying, I'm trying.

1052
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:39,810
I'm trying, but I'm scared.

1053
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:43,710
If I lose here, it's all over.

1054
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:55,830
So far.

1055
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:57,570
Maybe.

1056
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,270
Oh, this kid comes down, I remember.

1057
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,390
OK, I'm gonna stay right here.

1058
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,640
OK, alright.

1059
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:14,920
Now we wait...

1060
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:24,130
What if I get caught only one time on each floor?

1061
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:28,950
What if I get caught only one time...

1062
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,690
That kid wasn't supposed to turn around!

1063
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:31,430
This bastard!

1064
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:31,770
Bastard!

1065
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:39,690
Solid 2 is more elaborate.

1066
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,090
People have been begging me to play these games.

1067
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:44,350
OK.

1068
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,270
Oh my god, he turns around immediately.

1069
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,010
This kid sucks.

1070
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,690
You're getting coal for the rest of your life.

1071
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:52,670
Little Timmy.

1072
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:54,670
What an asshole.

1073
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:56,630
Ranked terrible, still cute though.

1074
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:57,150
Shut up!

1075
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:02,770
Shut up!

1076
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:06,690
No, not Mammoth!

1077
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:10,270
If we get anything other than Mammoth, I think that's kind of a win.

1078
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,500
I'm being extra cautious.

1079
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,040
I don't want the Mammoth.

1080
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,230
We are speedrunning!

1081
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:33,490
I might get like cheetah for how fast we are.

1082
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,070
They'll be like, whoa!

1083
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:36,690
Speed!

1084
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:38,710
Cheetah!

1085
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,050
You're the fastest.

1086
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,630
So speedy.

1087
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:50,530
Oh.

1088
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,350
Wait, why are you calling me?

1089
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,250
Oh.

1090
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:54,730
Hey!

1091
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,730
Shut up Santa's little helper.

1092
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,670
You're slowing down my playtime.

1093
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,470
Oh my gosh, that was close.

1094
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:04,950
Can you imagine if I accidentally ran into a laser?

1095
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,930
That'd be silly.

1096
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,550
That'd be silliness.

1097
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,450
Guys, we can do this.

1098
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:12,770
Maybe.

1099
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:14,430
Oh, the coal.

1100
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,210
That's right.

1101
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:15,590
OK.

1102
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:20,210
Oh wait, I think... OK.

1103
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,230
OK, that's right.

1104
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:25,030
We step in the coal.

1105
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:26,070
OK.

1106
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:29,850
I can't waste too much time because...

1107
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:30,650
OK, go, go, go!

1108
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:32,750
Who is that?

1109
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,350
Nobody?

1110
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:34,790
Nobody?

1111
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:37,430
No one?

1112
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:40,030
Nobody?

1113
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:41,230
Nobody?

1114
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:41,790
No one?

1115
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,350
Not a single person?

1116
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:45,510
Nobody?

1117
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,510
Are you kidding me right now?

1118
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,440
I think I paused there before thinking that the kid was going to...

1119
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:08,100
Wow.

1120
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,400
I'm so...

1121
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,880
I think... I was thinking the kid would do something else when I first played.

1122
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,480
That's why I didn't know I could get caught if I just didn't stop.

1123
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,100
But you have to stop there.

1124
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,750
But I don't know for how long.

1125
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:32,050
OK.

1126
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:35,790
I know for how long.

1127
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:36,650
Wow!

1128
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,970
This game is... Wow!

1129
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:42,690
It's really trying to kill me, huh?

1130
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,450
Yeah, you paused before.

1131
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:47,970
I did!

1132
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:51,110
It's OK.

1133
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:53,370
We only got caught two times, guys.

1134
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:54,970
Surely...

1135
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,790
Surely everything is fine.

1136
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:01,830
Oh, I got a gun now.

1137
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:02,530
I got the gun.

1138
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:03,190
The Nerf gun.

1139
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,530
OK.

1140
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:07,530
OK.

1141
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:13,170
Nighty night, kid.

1142
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,510
Nighty night, kid, too.

1143
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:17,850
OK.

1144
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,470
Shoot them kids.

1145
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,450
They're going downtown.

1146
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,610
They're going downtown.

1147
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,550
We only got discovered three times.

1148
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:39,150
We only got discovered three times now, guys.

1149
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,450
Don't worry about it.

1150
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:57,070
Oh, I put another one down on accident.

1151
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,850
Oh wait, that's right.

1152
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:01,750
I can just walk past them.

1153
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,520
This kid, though, he has no fear.

1154
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:14,700
Alright, next time.

1155
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:16,580
Wait.

1156
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,340
Oh, OK.

1157
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,040
Next time.

1158
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:19,420
Turn around.

1159
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:19,680
OK.

1160
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,240
My bullet was in mid!

1161
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:25,960
No!

1162
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,810
These kids, literal...

1163
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,850
This is what I meant to do.

1164
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:42,490
OK, there we go.

1165
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,750
OK, we didn't mess up.

1166
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,710
Oh, I did mess up.

1167
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,310
It's fine.

1168
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:52,870
Wait.

1169
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,380
OK, anyway.

1170
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,360
Back on track.

1171
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,550
OK, turn around.

1172
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:17,350
Turn around.

1173
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,050
Got him.

1174
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,450
Little bastard.

1175
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,230
Cool for you.

1176
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:22,730
Cool.

1177
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:23,370
Naughty.

1178
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:25,290
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

1179
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:26,750
Naughty child.

1180
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:28,090
Naughty boy.

1181
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,220
TV.

1182
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,140
TV.

1183
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,580
Run, run, run, run, run.

1184
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:55,820
First try!

1185
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:06,820
Yeah!

1186
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,440
Yeah!

1187
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,800
Oh, I accidentally left a present.

1188
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,040
Freeze.

1189
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,120
Speedrun.

1190
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,280
I can speedrun a little bit.

1191
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:28,560
What was my speed?

1192
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,440
I don't care about the credits anymore, please.

1193
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:32,920
Please let me out.

1194
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,340
Please let me out.

1195
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,160
It's kind of difficult because I'm looking at the window projector.

1196
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,900
But then I have to go back to my tiny screen.

1197
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,160
Oops, sorry.

1198
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,940
I have to go back to my tiny screen to press stuff.

1199
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,540
This entire song is just peaking.

1200
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,720
What an amazing first run.

1201
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,800
I'm just too good at this game.

1202
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,580
Louder?

1203
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,840
Do you want me to put it at what I normally have my music at?

1204
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,620
I don't think you want that.

1205
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,760
I don't think you want that.

1206
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:16,960
I'm dancing.

1207
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:18,400
I'm dancing.

1208
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,640
What do you think my rank is, you guys?

1209
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,560
I wanted to get Fox Santa.

1210
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,140
Foxy Santa.

1211
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,200
But he's probably already Foxy.

1212
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:36,880
Terrible!

1213
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,420
You're right.

1214
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,220
You're right.

1215
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,020
Terrible.

1216
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,560
What is it?

1217
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,580
What could it be?

1218
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,960
Oh wait, can I skip this part too?

1219
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,880
No, I can't.

1220
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,020
Big beard.

1221
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,960
Nice putty!

1222
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:01,720
No, sir.

1223
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,420
Yes, sir.

1224
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,700
No, sir.

1225
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,460
Yes, sir.

1226
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,600
Thinking zebra.

1227
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,460
What would zebra mean?

1228
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,720
Literally just left to heat up leftovers and she beat the game again already.

1229
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,000
I'm too good!

1230
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,580
I'm too good at this game.

1231
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:27,900
There is actually a sequel.

1232
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:28,620
I do know.

1233
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,200
I do know.

1234
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,000
We might not play it today, but that's OK.

1235
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,220
Let's see.

1236
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:45,800
What did I get?

1237
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,320
I'll never escape.

1238
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,980
I'll never escape the allegations.

1239
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,730
Is it the ears?

1240
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:37,810
Ranking.

1241
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:38,530
Elf.

1242
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:40,170
Elf.

1243
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:40,430
Stop.

1244
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,310
Well, even better.

1245
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:44,030
You know what?

1246
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:48,190
It was worth replaying, huh?

1247
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:52,370
For this, right?

1248
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:57,110
It was worth replaying for this, huh?

1249
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:57,830
I guess.

1250
01:19:57,970 --> 01:19:58,410
Maybe.

1251
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,230
Goodness, how silly.

1252
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:03,710
It was worth.

1253
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:09,470
You have the ears for... Oh wait, I have to go to the left to go to the right?

1254
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,260
Elf.

1255
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:23,920
Elf.

1256
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,360
Take the elf, Minto.

1257
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:31,800
Elf on the shelf.

1258
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,840
Oh my gosh, I've been watching a bunch of elf on the shelf videos.

1259
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,240
Because people are so funny with how creative they get with them, you know?

1260
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,760
Like they'll be like...

1261
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:43,000
They'll be like...

1262
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,920
Sometimes some people will put string on their elf, so when the kids walk into the room it looks like the elf is moving.

1263
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:57,020
And then they'll make it look like the elf was like...

1264
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,380
Oh no, I got caught.

1265
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,180
And like drop the strings, you know?

1266
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,700
And the kid will be like, my elf was moving!

1267
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:12,260
And Rainbow, thank you for joining.

1268
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,540
Welcome, thank you.

1269
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,180
Are you skipping elf practice?

1270
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,000
My mom used to get super creative with it for my younger brother, it was really sweet.

1271
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,160
Yeah, it looks fun.

1272
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,020
Looks fun.

1273
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,740
Anyway, let's see.

1274
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:36,900
Hot dog.

1275
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,300
Elf minto would be cute too.

1276
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,320
I can't be a ghost elf.

1277
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:46,240
I think that's too many layers.

1278
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:47,240
Right?

1279
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,060
I can't be a maid and a ghost and an elf.

1280
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,800
I have to be only, like you know, I have to be...

1281
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:00,320
Ghost maid or ghost elf.

1282
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,220
I can't be both.

1283
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,380
I can't be both.

1284
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,640
Oh, sorry.

1285
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,160
You could submit this run on speedrun.

1286
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,560
Why could I?

1287
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,700
Elf minto never beating the alligators.

1288
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,380
I guess, you guys just want to hang out and talk until...

1289
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,100
For just a bit.

1290
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,460
I know that...

1291
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:30,160
I know there is a sequel, but I don't feel like quite doing it today.

1292
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:30,960
I'm sorry guys.

1293
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,280
I'm sorry.

1294
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,520
Okay, let me go to the bathroom first and then we'll just hang out.

1295
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,840
You guys can listen to the song for a bit.

1296
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,600
Okay, hold on.

1297
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,100
I'll be right back.

1298
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,540
I'm going to turn off Amerigear.

1299
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,220
Oh wait, let me do this first.

1300
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,080
There we go.

1301
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,040
Goodbye Amerigear.

1302
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:11,420
Goodbye, goodbye.

1303
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,200
Let's go... Okay, hold on.

1304
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,000
Let's go to... Oh wait, hold on.

1305
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I have to go to the right, to go to the left, to go to the right, to go to the left.

1306
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,640
And then we'll go to here.

1307
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,340
And then we'll do this, and then we'll do that.

1308
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:27,900
Okay,

1309
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:37,950
I have to get rid of that.

1310
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:39,090
Dang it!

1311
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:41,190
It ruined all my stuff!

1312
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:49,610
I've been having so many issues with my... As I told you, I've been having so many issues with my monitors.

1313
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:53,530
And it keeps ruining my OBS settings every time!

1314
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:01,180
It's so frustrating, actually.

1315
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,780
So frustrating, actually.

1316
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:10,620
And then also my... I'm all messed up too.

1317
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,020
Okay, maybe that.

1318
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:14,860
Okay.

1319
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,880
Okay, I'm going to make it a little bigger.

1320
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:23,300
And I'm gonna... We don't need the eye patch anymore, I suppose.

1321
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,360
What happened?

1322
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:27,540
If you didn't see, that's okay.

1323
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,060
It's better that way.

1324
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,540
It's better that way.

1325
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:36,740
If you don't see.

1326
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:36,760
Wait.

1327
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,140
No,

1328
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,780
don't say what it was!

1329
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:46,780
Stop it!

1330
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:47,560
Stop!

1331
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,240
Don't ruin the illusion!

1332
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:50,820
Stop!

1333
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:51,920
Stop!

1334
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,300
Are you sure they're both plugged directly into your GPU ports?

1335
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,960
I've had issues with that before.

1336
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:00,380
They should be.

1337
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,660
I'll check after, though.

1338
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:07,810
Stop.

1339
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:10,230
Stop.

1340
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:12,870
This is the Wizard of Oz.

1341
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,300
There you go, thanks for the five gifted.

1342
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,150
Did you have fun?

1343
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,870
I did!

1344
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:29,150
That was actually so good.

1345
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:33,930
I feel like most of the levels were... I don't want to say too easy.

1346
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:35,710
I liked the last level.

1347
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:37,830
I wish there was more of ones like the last one.

1348
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,430
That were more puzzly, you know?

1349
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,030
So I'll head for the concert next weekend.

1350
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:46,210
It's going to be my first trip to Atlanta.

1351
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,610
Wow, let's go!

1352
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:51,470
Um...

1353
01:27:51,470 --> 01:28:01,670
Things to do in Atlanta.

1354
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:02,910
Waffle House.

1355
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:08,410
I told Doki we should go to Waffle House.

1356
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:14,790
I was like, what do we do while we're there?

1357
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,210
Waffle House.

1358
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,470
The elusive Waffle House.

1359
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:26,750
Don't go to the downtown one.

1360
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:27,610
Why?

1361
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,090
Is it bad?

1362
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:31,550
Wait, isn't it good if it's bad, though?

1363
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:33,870
Wouldn't it be better for it to be bad?

1364
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:39,330
Wouldn't it be better if it's a PvP zone?

1365
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:42,250
Oh, sorry.

1366
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,410
Sorry, my computer is all messed up.

1367
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:48,550
My computer is all messed up.

1368
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:49,570
Good luck with the concert.

1369
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:50,390
Thanks!

1370
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,370
Become a vampire ghost.

1371
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,010
No.

1372
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,550
Waffle House fights are the best.

1373
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:03,130
It's not a Waffle House, it's a Waffle Home.

1374
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:06,310
Cabo, thank you.

1375
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:15,190
Yeah, I'm trying to take it a little bit easy this week in terms of stream lengths.

1376
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:20,130
So, even though tomorrow I want to play Indiana Jones...

1377
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:25,390
But I was like...

1378
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:28,250
The aquarium is really good.

1379
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:28,990
Really?

1380
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:31,750
Wait, it's the biggest in the US?

1381
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,790
What?

1382
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:38,630
Okay.

1383
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:40,230
Noted.

1384
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:46,730
Have fun at the Atlanta Ferris Wheel.

1385
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,770
There's a Ferris Wheel?

1386
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:54,190
Like just... What makes it the Atlanta Ferris Wheel?

1387
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:57,570
Sister, they got a whale shark.

1388
01:29:57,570 --> 01:30:00,390
Oh my god!

1389
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:04,130
I love whale sharks.

1390
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:09,570
Okay, I got a message, Doki.

1391
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:11,930
We're going to the aquarium.

1392
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:14,970
Oh my god!

1393
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:20,310
Because it's Atlanta.

1394
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,490
It's in Atlanta.

1395
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:25,310
I thought it would be like in the shape of a peach or something.

1396
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:28,250
They should theme it.

1397
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:30,070
If it's in Georgia.

1398
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,830
They should theme it as a peach, right?

1399
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:34,270
Oh my gosh.

1400
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,250
Can you imagine going on a Ferris Wheel and being like...

1401
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,050
This is the butt wheel.

1402
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:44,530
You can also tour the Coca-Cola factory?

1403
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,680
It wouldn't be a wheel then, would it?

1404
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:13,160
I don't know what kind of buttocks you were looking at, but I'm always looking at a nice round...

1405
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:17,220
It's round.

1406
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:25,140
I'll see you at Ofuka?

1407
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:25,700
Yeah!

1408
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,760
Gonna need more Ace Combat merch.

1409
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:31,920
Tour the Coke factory and taste sodas from all over the world.

1410
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,420
Most of them are horrible.

1411
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:38,820
Wait...

1412
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,440
A nice round thing.

1413
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,500
An itty bitty waist and a big round thing in your face, you get sprung.

1414
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,900
In the Ferris Wheel, son.

1415
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:58,940
Oh yeah, I don't think I would want to go to the Coca-Cola place though, because...

1416
01:31:58,940 --> 01:31:59,860
I can't have soda.

1417
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,720
So it's like...

1418
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,300
Don't believe them?

1419
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,460
The world of Coke is not worth all.

1420
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,720
Yeah, I can't have soda, so it's like...

1421
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,400
I wouldn't be able to drink anything.

1422
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,060
Pika!

1423
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:18,460
Welcome to Bubble Ship!

1424
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:19,560
Thank you.

1425
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,100
The Coke place is right by the aquarium.

1426
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,300
Double feature.

1427
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:29,260
Do you think we could go to both in a day?

1428
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,940
Or is the aquarium too big?

1429
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,400
A lot of people do.

1430
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,060
The Coke thing is super short.

1431
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,240
Maybe Doki would like it.

1432
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,200
I can't have soda, but Doki might like it.

1433
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,800
Stick to the aquarium.

1434
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:58,640
Go to Legoland?

1435
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,020
Legoland?

1436
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,220
There's Legoland?

1437
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,420
I know that there's the Six Flags in Georgia.

1438
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,640
I'm new here, thanks to Doki Bird.

1439
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,120
Hello.

1440
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,920
Hello, hello.

1441
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:25,640
Is... Do you think there would be... Wait, is the Six Flags... Wait, for people that know...

1442
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:30,260
Is there Six Flags... No, sorry.

1443
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,700
Is the Six Flags close?

1444
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:36,880
Or is it like a Disney situation where it's far?

1445
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,440
There's a Lego Discovery Center.

1446
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,340
What?

1447
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,860
It's not close.

1448
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,180
It's closed?

1449
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:48,240
Oh.

1450
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,380
What?

1451
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,600
It's closed?

1452
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,400
What happened?

1453
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,640
It's closed for the season?

1454
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,860
They don't do... They don't do...

1455
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,160
Like, winter stuff?

1456
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,320
Like Disney does?

1457
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:20,460
It's one hour... Oh, one hour out of Atlanta is closed for the season.

1458
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:21,240
No!

1459
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,880
No, I wanted to ride!

1460
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:32,280
I figured though that probably we wouldn't have time and it would be kind of bad actually to like...

1461
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,280
Can you imagine I go on a rollercoaster and I'm like...

1462
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:40,080
And then at the concert I'm like, hey guys, I can't talk.

1463
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:45,780
Hey guys, I lost my voice at Six Flags.

1464
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,980
But that might happen if I go to the aquarium too.

1465
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:52,320
I'm just like...

1466
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,800
I wonder if we could go...

1467
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,280
We'll have to see our schedule.

1468
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,880
I don't really know...

1469
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,660
We'll have two Dokis on stage.

1470
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,660
Hey guys, I'm Doki Bird.

1471
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:11,500
Do you scream at the fish?

1472
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,580
You don't?

1473
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,980
You don't get so excited over seeing the fish?

1474
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,790
I don't know what our schedule is like yet.

1475
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,210
I don't know.

1476
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:29,630
I actually don't know when Doki gets in, so...

1477
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,350
We haven't made any plans at all.

1478
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:43,100
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's this weekend.

1479
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,680
It's this weekend.

1480
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:48,400
Scary.

1481
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:49,800
I'm so nervous.

1482
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,580
I wanna also check out the convention too.

1483
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,480
I wanna haunt it a little bit if we have time.

1484
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,060
There's too much to do now, huh?

1485
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:04,600
We gotta go to the convention, we gotta go to the Coca-Cola, we gotta go to the aquarium.

1486
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:09,940
We gotta go to the Ferris wheel, but not...

1487
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,480
Wait, so the Ferris wheel...

1488
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,500
It's just a Ferris wheel.

1489
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,560
It's not like at a theme park?

1490
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,170
Atlanta is a big city.

1491
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:29,470
What food would you recommend for anybody that knows?

1492
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:33,070
Food, food, food.

1493
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:35,370
Food, food.

1494
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:36,650
I'm thinking Waffle House.

1495
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,750
I'm thinking...

1496
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:46,430
Wagaya.

1497
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:48,070
Soul food.

1498
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:52,510
The Atlanta Botanical Garden has a beautiful Christmas light display at night.

1499
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:54,250
Be prepared to walk though.

1500
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,470
Oh my gosh, I would love to go to a garden.

1501
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,270
That sounds so nice.

1502
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,870
Minto, is that one girl from Finding Nemo?

1503
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,850
I'm a piranha.

1504
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:21,090
That's like how you... That's the one thing you always ask though when you're going to a place, right?

1505
01:37:21,190 --> 01:37:23,570
What do you get... What do you get to eat?

1506
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:27,610
I remember when Zun went to AWA a while back.

1507
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:31,010
They put Tenchi on the official con t-shirt because of peaches.

1508
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:34,510
Because of the peaches on her hat, right?

1509
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:38,050
That's such a...

1510
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:40,630
That's such a random character.

1511
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,770
That's so random.

1512
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:48,050
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

1513
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,050
Vortex is great.

1514
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,670
The varsity is not worth the trip.

1515
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:52,490
It's basic burgers and fries.

1516
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:53,770
Not terrible.

1517
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:54,750
You could get it anywhere.

1518
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:57,510
Noted.

1519
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,130
The Vortex.

1520
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:01,910
Vortex and Fox Bros Barbecue.

1521
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:04,450
I want some barbecue!

1522
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:06,310
Oh yeah!

1523
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:11,610
And for those who can't make it to the...

1524
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:14,690
To the... To the concert...

1525
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:15,490
Hopefully...

1526
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:19,250
Hopefully...

1527
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:21,190
We can just have another concert, right?

1528
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:30,490
I imagine this is not going to be mine nor Doki's last concert, so...

1529
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:35,310
There's this place called McDonald's?

1530
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:37,830
Wait...

1531
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:38,870
Master?

1532
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,890
Master McDonald?

1533
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:48,170
Wisps are flying Krisu out.

1534
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:50,370
And he'll try to get a recording up.

1535
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:51,230
Yes!

1536
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:52,950
Krisu!

1537
01:38:54,190 --> 01:38:56,230
You guys are flying him out.

1538
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:01,150
There's a super good barbecue place named Woods Chapel near the concert venue.

1539
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:02,810
Fox Bros is also really good.

1540
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:03,970
Okay, I need to write these down.

1541
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:04,950
Fox Bros?

1542
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:06,730
Wait, Fox Bros?

1543
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:07,750
Fox Hound?

1544
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:11,610
I might have to go to Fox Bros because...

1545
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:12,450
My brain rot.

1546
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:14,330
And what was the other one?

1547
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:16,170
Woods Chapel.

1548
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:18,890
Woods Chapel.

1549
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:20,890
And then you guys said...

1550
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:23,690
Vortex.

1551
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:26,490
Not the Varsity.

1552
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:30,410
When are we opening Minto's maxi buns?

1553
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,600
The Vortex.

1554
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,920
Take pics, please, if food.

1555
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:42,780
I will try.

1556
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,120
I'm not usually so good about taking pictures of my food.

1557
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,760
But I'll try.

1558
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,360
I'll try, I'll try.

1559
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,040
Hot dog.

1560
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:53,060
You.

1561
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,820
You're from the North Pole.

1562
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:58,180
There's nothing there but snow drifts and sweet gifts.

1563
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,340
And you don't look cold and powdery to me.

1564
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,080
So that just about narrows it down.

1565
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,340
What is this referencing?

1566
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,880
Just a reminder since another user let me know.

1567
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:11,980
If you order the VIP package, the message closes tomorrow.

1568
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,020
Check your spam folders.

1569
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:16,680
Check, check, check.

1570
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:18,360
He reminded me.

1571
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,340
I need to do some stuff.

1572
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:24,960
There's still so much to do.

1573
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,180
Taking a bunch of plane figures on Bayi.

1574
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,780
I looked up that art book.

1575
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:34,000
He told me about it.

1576
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,500
I looked it up on Mercari.

1577
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:36,480
JP.

1578
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,600
And I saw one and then it got sold out.

1579
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,600
But there was another one.

1580
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:42,480
There was a couple on there.

1581
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,060
I haven't bought it yet.

1582
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,440
Oh, full metal jacket.

1583
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:52,100
Yes!

1584
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,260
Yes, yes, yes.

1585
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,480
Bayi, they're great.

1586
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,080
Yeah, they're very helpful.

1587
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,460
Very helpful, right?

1588
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:10,400
Especially because I get a lot of stuff on Mercari Japan.

1589
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,480
Maybe too much stuff.

1590
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,900
I basically check everyday.

1591
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:19,680
I basically check everyday for Metal Gear things.

1592
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:25,980
I still have to... I got the mats, the floor mats that they recently released.

1593
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,280
And the pillows.

1594
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,320
I haven't bought the little jiggly plushies yet.

1595
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:34,180
I gotta get those too.

1596
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,060
I use Bayi for booth.

1597
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,440
See, I use Tenso for booth.

1598
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:44,160
I had a Tenso account before I had a Bayi account.

1599
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:49,000
And so, all my booth stuff goes through Tenso.

1600
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,420
Which is the same company.

1601
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:51,720
They're getting my money.

1602
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,100
They get a lot of my money.

1603
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,060
I got one from Bayi.

1604
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,440
Guess I was lucky.

1605
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,020
Nice!

1606
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,320
Check Ebay.

1607
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,100
Oh, yeah.

1608
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:06,060
Well, because you mentioned the ones that were in Japanese.

1609
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:09,120
And of course, since it was Mercari Japan, it's in Japanese.

1610
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,100
But I would like to get an English one.

1611
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:12,980
What's the difference?

1612
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,480
So Tenso...

1613
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,320
Okay, so Bayi...

1614
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,260
Yeah, Bayi...

1615
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:23,500
Works for specific sites like Mercari and Yahoo Auctions.

1616
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,780
But Tenso...

1617
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,940
Basically, you send them the item and they buy it for you.

1618
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:34,140
But Tenso gives you your own address.

1619
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:37,980
So you can purchase things directly from the website.

1620
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:41,840
C.O.D.

1621
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,220
Yeah, Tenso is just forwarding.

1622
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:49,580
I stopped using Tenso because they don't do C.O.D.

1623
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:51,060
What is that?

1624
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,300
C.O.D.

1625
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:54,840
What's that?

1626
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,340
Call of Duty?

1627
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,080
Oh, cash on delivery.

1628
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:06,560
What's...

1629
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,100
What circumstance would you...

1630
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,000
Need that?

1631
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,180
Like if you were trying to...

1632
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,000
Pay...

1633
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:19,560
For...

1634
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,880
When you have to pay duties.

1635
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,620
Are you feeling better from yesterday?

1636
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:31,300
I was gonna make a CPR joke, but my cringe sensor is on.

1637
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,640
I am feeling better, thank you.

1638
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,240
Yeah, I'm sorry again, I didn't really want to bring it up.

1639
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,100
But if you saw...

1640
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,260
The...

1641
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,340
What's the word?

1642
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,140
The...

1643
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:47,860
Devil May Cry 3 stream.

1644
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,120
I wasn't feeling very well yesterday.

1645
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:56,920
Basically...

1646
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,420
I was like...

1647
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:00,360
I was having a bad day.

1648
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:03,620
And then I didn't have time to eat.

1649
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:06,820
But I also had no appetite to eat.

1650
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:07,740
Because I was so...

1651
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,940
I've been a little...

1652
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:09,380
I don't know.

1653
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,520
I've been a little brain broke recently.

1654
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,360
And I...

1655
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,920
Got over my chair and I...

1656
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,740
I don't know.

1657
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,600
I don't want to describe it in such a detail.

1658
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:21,220
Or anything.

1659
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,820
But essentially, I like...

1660
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:26,880
Got really dizzy.

1661
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:28,760
And then I like...

1662
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:29,700
Had like a panic attack.

1663
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,860
I was like, I think I should leave.

1664
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,020
So...

1665
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:40,700
You know.

1666
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:42,440
But I'm feeling better today.

1667
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,680
Sorry, again, about it.

1668
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:55,980
But it's okay.

1669
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:57,260
Yeah.

1670
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:58,420
It's okay.

1671
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:04,450
Thank you.

1672
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:07,050
Until my first...

1673
01:45:07,730 --> 01:45:09,010
Vtuber concert yesterday.

1674
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:12,030
I usually don't dance, but...

1675
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:12,170
Thanks.

1676
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:13,030
I dance so much.

1677
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:14,310
Let's go!

1678
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:17,010
Sounds so fun.

1679
01:45:17,910 --> 01:45:20,030
Oh my gosh, I was watching the...

1680
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:21,630
I didn't get tickets for it.

1681
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:24,190
But I was watching like the freebie streaming...

1682
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:25,910
Of Marine's concert.

1683
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:27,490
And...

1684
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:30,350
Oh my gosh, the stage was so cool!

1685
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:33,170
It was like in the shape of a boat!

1686
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:34,830
It was so awesome.

1687
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:37,970
Yeah, our new model.

1688
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:39,530
The one with the horns?

1689
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:40,670
Oh my god.

1690
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,510
I missed it.

1691
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:42,590
I think it's still...

1692
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:44,750
You can still watch the free hour.

1693
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:50,390
It was so cool.

1694
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:54,810
Like I said, I didn't get the full thing.

1695
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:57,450
But...

1696
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:01,100
Did you see the streamer awards?

1697
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:01,720
Oh!

1698
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:04,560
I didn't watch, but I saw...

1699
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,840
Mousy's concert.

1700
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:06,820
Oh my gosh.

1701
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,040
Like her...

1702
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,260
Her 3D thing.

1703
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,480
I guess you call it a concert, right?

1704
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:12,340
Her 3D...

1705
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:12,860
Show?

1706
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:15,280
It was so awesome too!

1707
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:17,600
There was so much going on.

1708
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:19,700
Yeah.

1709
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,480
I don't typically watch...

1710
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,500
Awards.

1711
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,420
Her 3D performance.

1712
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:27,860
Yeah!

1713
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:30,280
It was so good.

1714
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:31,220
It was so, so good.

1715
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:32,240
I was like...

1716
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,160
Oh my gosh.

1717
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:34,380
I was really happy for her.

1718
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,760
I thought...

1719
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:39,480
I saw that...

1720
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,880
I saw a lot of people were there.

1721
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,980
Like Gigi was there.

1722
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,480
Doki was there.

1723
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:47,660
Mousy was there.

1724
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:53,070
I think it's cool what they're doing.

1725
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:53,530
Right!

1726
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:56,690
I'm glad that...

1727
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:57,870
It seems that more...

1728
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:02,850
More people are...

1729
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:03,710
How do I say?

1730
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:05,790
Not accepting, but are more...

1731
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:08,630
Knowing about Vtubers.

1732
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:13,150
Uh...

1733
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:16,750
Doki was there in spirit.

1734
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:17,710
I thought she was actually...

1735
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:19,030
There there.

1736
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:20,130
Or not like...

1737
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:20,410
You know.

1738
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:22,130
I thought I saw her on the iPad.

1739
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:24,410
Recognizing.

1740
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:25,330
Yeah.

1741
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:27,670
Aware of open to Vtubers, right?

1742
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:32,630
She was streaming...

1743
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:40,960
Did she just...

1744
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,260
Think that she didn't win?

1745
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,240
What did she want?

1746
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,480
She was a wallpaper on the iPad?

1747
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:47,040
What?

1748
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:55,910
She was going to pause it.

1749
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:56,750
Oh my god.

1750
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,940
Did she finally beat Silent Hill 2?

1751
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:17,270
She would have had Gumi put her on call.

1752
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,130
Oh, she did beat it.

1753
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:20,270
I wonder if she like...

1754
01:48:20,270 --> 01:48:20,990
Did she like it?

1755
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:25,890
Silent Hill 2...

1756
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:27,010
She got the best ending?

1757
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:38,250
I think she had mixed feelings.

1758
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:39,710
Like is a strong word.

1759
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:50,210
She got the best ending despite what her chat was shouting at her.

1760
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:51,650
That's pretty typical, right?

1761
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:53,890
She checked the map 644 times.

1762
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:54,710
It counts?

1763
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:56,390
How many times did you check the map?

1764
01:48:58,430 --> 01:49:01,070
I still haven't played the remake.

1765
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:04,370
I know it got really great reviews.

1766
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,530
I feel like...

1767
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:06,470
I feel like...

1768
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:11,390
So many games have come out that people have been like...

1769
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:13,070
Kind of like...

1770
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:15,330
I'm not sure how this is going to be.

1771
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:18,810
And so many games have come out that exceeded people's expectations.

1772
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:20,890
I'm really happy about that.

1773
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:26,270
I don't have any plans on streaming it.

1774
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:28,550
I played Silent Hill 2, the original.

1775
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:33,750
But...

1776
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:37,010
It's a bit too combat heavy, IMO.

1777
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:38,070
I've heard that...

1778
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:40,170
I've heard that complaint about it.

1779
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:43,990
How you go into a room and there's basically a mannequin in every single room.

1780
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:46,490
Like you go into a room and you prepare for the combat.

1781
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:54,110
Streaming the Game Awards?

1782
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:54,770
When is that?

1783
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:55,750
When are the Game Awards?

1784
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:58,170
Game Awards...

1785
01:49:58,170 --> 01:49:59,250
Oh, sorry.

1786
01:50:00,630 --> 01:50:01,510
My window...

1787
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:02,870
Oh, my computer's all borked.

1788
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:07,710
Game Awards...

1789
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:09,690
2024.

1790
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:12,510
The twel...

1791
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:12,770
Oh.

1792
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:14,250
Oh, wait.

1793
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:15,910
No!

1794
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:18,010
I can't!

1795
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,280
I cannot.

1796
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:23,540
No!

1797
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,980
I will just think about Astro Bot.

1798
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,140
As an OG Silent Hill 2 fan...

1799
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:43,880
I started it last week.

1800
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:44,980
It's definitely combat heavy.

1801
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,000
But it keeps the game tense in a different way.

1802
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,300
I didn't dislike it at all.

1803
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,020
That's fair.

1804
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:49,900
No, I think...

1805
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:51,860
I think different is good too.

1806
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,640
It's kind of also like a lot of people...

1807
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:58,320
I know it hasn't come out yet, but Delta...

1808
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,380
People have been very like...

1809
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:02,100
I don't think so, but...

1810
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:08,560
A lot of people trying it at Tokyo Game Show and everything...

1811
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,480
Have been like...

1812
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:11,700
Yeah, baby, this is the good stuff.

1813
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,320
Me included.

1814
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,260
I'm very optimistic.

1815
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,920
And I know...

1816
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,960
I know it's hard...

1817
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,580
It's way easier to be jaded about stuff...

1818
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:24,260
When there's been many letdowns.

1819
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:29,660
But I think it's fun to be optimistic about things...

1820
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:31,560
And wanting to like things, you know?

1821
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:35,440
I think it's good to be...

1822
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,140
You know...

1823
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,520
Like excited for stuff.

1824
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:45,630
If only I could get a PS5.

1825
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:49,170
For...

1826
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:51,050
Astro Bot?

1827
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:55,850
Or for Delta, because Delta is not just gonna be...

1828
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:57,090
Not just PS5.

1829
01:51:57,390 --> 01:51:58,370
Unlike what I thought.

1830
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:00,630
But I got Astro Bot, so honestly...

1831
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:04,550
I don't regret my PS5 purchase.

1832
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,010
Astro Bot and Delta.

1833
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:12,930
I wonder...

1834
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:15,950
I wonder if I should play Delta on my PS5.

1835
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:18,890
I don't know, I haven't thought...

1836
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:20,070
I haven't decided yet.

1837
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:24,720
Welcome to membership!

1838
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:25,960
Thank you!

1839
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:26,700
Thank you, thank you!

1840
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:28,240
Fiveever and Lofilesbian.

1841
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,300
Thank you guys!

1842
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:30,960
Welcome, welcome.

1843
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:36,060
No mods on PS5 though.

1844
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:36,980
True.

1845
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:38,800
Very, very true.

1846
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,040
Very, very true.

1847
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,760
I played...

1848
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:48,860
I played MGSV on console.

1849
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,140
So I didn't get any of the mods.

1850
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:55,260
And I wanted to change the music.

1851
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,180
You know how you can like set custom music for P-Quad.

1852
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:03,490
Seems like they're actually trying with Delta.

1853
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:06,590
Especially after the negative reception MGS collection got.

1854
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:07,370
Yeah!

1855
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:11,010
I think they have listened very much to their fans.

1856
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:13,830
Or rather to people's criticisms.

1857
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:14,970
Which is good.

1858
01:53:15,490 --> 01:53:17,670
They haven't shied away from it at all.

1859
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:21,250
Did you see Platypus getting a remaster?

1860
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:22,710
Platypus?

1861
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:34,970
Ever since you told them dragoons have been feminizing each other and won't stop.

1862
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:40,590
This is your fault and I hope you're happy with the chaos you've caused.

1863
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:42,910
I...

1864
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:47,300
I thought Doki said...

1865
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:50,260
Oh she was like I'm gonna nip that in the bud.

1866
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,340
They won't.

1867
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,360
They won't do that.

1868
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:55,180
That's not my fault.

1869
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,520
That's Doki's fault.

1870
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,000
If you ever want to play Fortnite you should invite Doki.

1871
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:07,940
Epic gave her the ability to create custom battle royale lobbies to play with fans.

1872
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:08,500
Oh really?

1873
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:11,840
Interesting.

1874
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,020
Interesting.

1875
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,460
Really?

1876
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,220
That's so gross.

1877
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:18,000
Where exactly?

1878
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:19,520
Yeah.

1879
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:23,300
Can we please direct Fukigan to the...

1880
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:25,140
To the...

1881
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:26,020
To the photos.

1882
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:27,180
For evidence.

1883
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:28,800
For...

1884
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,660
For evidence that we can use...

1885
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:32,400
To...

1886
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:35,960
Learn about the enemy's weakness.

1887
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:39,020
And how we can take him down.

1888
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:40,020
Hold on.

1889
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:50,560
What would he do?

1890
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:51,840
He would just...

1891
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:52,360
He would...

1892
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:56,780
He would encounter an enemy and literally he would auto run away.

1893
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:00,420
He would auto escape.

1894
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,020
People are saying Miku.

1895
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,020
I saw that.

1896
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,400
I saw a tweet actually that was saying...

1897
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:13,840
Miku is going to be in Fortnite.

1898
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:15,100
What?

1899
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:18,520
Fortnite might actually be the most powerful game of all time.

1900
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,540
It's kind of insane.

1901
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,560
Now...

1902
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:27,180
Have they gotten like any...

1903
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:28,940
Like Final Fantasy characters?

1904
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:36,130
This reminds me...

1905
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:37,170
Marry me, Minto.

1906
01:55:37,370 --> 01:55:38,270
What do you mean?

1907
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:41,570
What reminds you?

1908
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:48,470
No Final Fantasy yet.

1909
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:49,950
Not even Caitlyn?

1910
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:52,710
I miss Caitlyn.

1911
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:56,530
Meeting Cait-Syn?

1912
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,630
Stop it!

1913
01:55:58,790 --> 01:56:00,290
I miss him!

1914
01:56:04,670 --> 01:56:06,230
Having Tifa and...

1915
01:56:06,230 --> 01:56:06,640
Tifa...

1916
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:07,990
Did I say Tifa?

1917
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:11,690
Having Tifa and Aerith would be great though.

1918
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:15,790
I'll go nuts if they add Sora.

1919
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:19,150
Have they added any Square Enix characters?

1920
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:22,190
Come on, they gotta...

1921
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:23,390
Those are the negotiations.

1922
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:24,350
They gotta work on.

1923
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:31,040
They have Snake in Fortnite though.

1924
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:31,400
I know.

1925
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:32,220
I have him.

1926
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:35,800
Tifa.

1927
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,580
She's all toothy.

1928
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,340
Fortnite Snake stream.

1929
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,900
I got him.

1930
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:45,120
I need to use him, right?

1931
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,020
I got him.

1932
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:51,300
I'm sad I couldn't get Raiden and Old Snake though.

1933
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:52,640
Because I couldn't play much.

1934
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:53,980
It was...

1935
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,600
Snake came out right before I was leaving for Japan.

1936
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:00,720
So like...

1937
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,080
It was a bad timing for me.

1938
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,840
Earlier this year.

1939
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:08,940
Raiden comes back every so often but...

1940
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:09,840
Old Snake!

1941
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,060
But Old Snake!

1942
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:12,620
Snake!

1943
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,680
I thought you said you got Old Snake.

1944
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:16,080
No, I don't think so.

1945
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,120
I don't think so.

1946
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:22,460
Sad.

1947
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:24,180
So sad.

1948
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,860
Sadly, Fortnite doesn't have Snakes but...

1949
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:29,680
That is true.

1950
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,940
Yeah, it's Disney which is powerful.

1951
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:33,740
True, true.

1952
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:36,170
I think the Disney stuff is so funny and how they're like...

1953
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,120
How they're like...

1954
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:41,800
Oh yeah, some of our Disney characters, they don't have weapons.

1955
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:44,720
Like, you know what game you were putting them in.

1956
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:48,340
You know that...

1957
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:50,900
You know that Fortnite is a shooty game.

1958
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:54,120
If you didn't want your characters to shoot...

1959
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:56,280
Why would you...

1960
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,680
Why would you put them in?

1961
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:04,860
Silliness.

1962
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,020
The season is Baymax.

1963
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:11,560
Cute!

1964
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:18,550
Cute.

1965
01:58:18,910 --> 01:58:20,450
I never got Goku either.

1966
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:21,270
I was so sad.

1967
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:25,210
Do you know Ace Combat series?

1968
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:30,390
The composer is the same one that does the music for Idolmaster in the latest Final Fantasy 7 remake.

1969
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:30,770
Really?

1970
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:34,970
The music in Final Fantasy 7 remake is so...

1971
01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:36,790
It's so beautiful.

1972
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:39,230
I love the many many arrangements of...

1973
01:58:39,230 --> 01:58:43,950
I love Tifa's theme and Aerith's theme and I love how many arrangements there were.

1974
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:45,950
No Goku.

1975
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:47,570
Goku, Goku, Goku.

1976
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:52,330
Snakes don't belong in Tomato Town.

1977
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,530
Vtubers in Fortnite win?

1978
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:57,950
I can 100% see...

1979
01:58:58,510 --> 01:58:59,950
Ironmouse or Gura...

1980
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:03,370
Getting in Fortnite.

1981
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:10,860
I can 100% see either of them.

1982
01:59:15,930 --> 01:59:16,830
Why not Doki?

1983
01:59:18,510 --> 01:59:19,790
I can see her too.

1984
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:24,150
But you know how it's like...

1985
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:26,130
When people think of the big...

1986
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:26,930
The biggest...

1987
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:27,830
The big big biggies...

1988
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:30,050
Of Vtubing...

1989
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:30,650
In the West.

1990
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:32,430
It's Ironmouse and Gura, you know?

1991
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:37,190
Why not Minto?

1992
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:38,210
I think I'm okay.

1993
01:59:39,210 --> 01:59:42,250
No, if I got the offer to be put in Fortnite...

1994
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:45,430
I think that is one offer I would accept.

1995
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:47,430
Some other things...

1996
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:51,110
I have declined.

1997
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:53,410
Because...

1998
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:54,790
I've been like...

1999
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:55,610
I...

2000
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:58,450
Don't want this for myself.

2001
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:01,430
So I would not want others to...

2002
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:07,930
I am not so money hungry to accept everything.

2003
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:11,490
So...

2004
02:00:11,490 --> 02:00:13,410
Some offers I have been like...

2005
02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:15,110
Thank you for the offer!

2006
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,850
But I think I'm good.

2007
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:18,870
Are you allowed to say what?

2008
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:23,410
I will not say exactly...

2009
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:25,600
But...

2010
02:00:27,450 --> 02:00:28,150
Certain...

2011
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:31,490
Companies that make figurines...

2012
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:33,410
And such...

2013
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:36,740
So...

2014
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:38,990
I've been kind of like...

2015
02:00:38,990 --> 02:00:40,350
I don't...

2016
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:42,410
I don't want it, so...

2017
02:00:55,570 --> 02:00:57,690
You guys are not guessing correctly.

2018
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:58,350
But that's okay.

2019
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:02,150
That's okay.

2020
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:06,690
I don't know.

2021
02:01:08,570 --> 02:01:10,470
I don't really like those...

2022
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:14,650
The ones that are like...

2023
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:18,130
You know, not to knock anybody else who gets them, obviously.

2024
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:20,090
If they get them, like...

2025
02:01:20,090 --> 02:01:20,870
That's totally fine.

2026
02:01:21,210 --> 02:01:22,050
But like the...

2027
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:24,230
The companies that like...

2028
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:26,250
Have their like standardized...

2029
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:28,470
Faces or...

2030
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:29,970
Like the...

2031
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:31,430
Figures all look the same.

2032
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:36,010
Either with the same face or like the same...

2033
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:36,870
Body or something.

2034
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:40,490
I'm not a huge fan.

2035
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:42,370
So...

2036
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:43,530
I was just like...

2037
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:48,680
I think I'm good.

2038
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:57,360
But...

2039
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:59,020
Hopefully one day I can get a Nendoroid.

2040
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:04,900
Hopefully one day I can get a Nendoroid or...

2041
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:06,440
I don't really collect Nendoroids.

2042
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:07,600
I really want...

2043
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:10,780
If I could have the option, I would really want a...

2044
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:12,180
Pop-up parade, I think.

2045
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:17,740
I would really want a pop-up parade.

2046
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:22,100
One that's like a...

2047
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:24,260
Not a scale figure, but almost, right?

2048
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,000
I love pop-up parades.

2049
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,340
They're so...

2050
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:29,960
They're such...

2051
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:32,580
They're such nice quality for the price point.

2052
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:35,160
I'm like, thank goodness these exist.

2053
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:38,400
And they have so many...

2054
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,440
So many different people.

2055
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:43,200
Are you going to get the Kiwawa Nendo?

2056
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:44,800
See...

2057
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,580
I'm conflicted, because like I said, I don't...

2058
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:51,120
I don't think I...

2059
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:52,300
Actually, no.

2060
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:55,580
I have some Nendoroids, but they're very old ones.

2061
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:58,320
I haven't bought a Nendoroid in a really long time.

2062
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:01,440
I'm so glad that it finally came out.

2063
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:04,840
I think I'll probably get it, just because it's Kiwawa, you know?

2064
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:08,280
I felt so bad for her.

2065
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:11,240
I was like, please, release the Wawa.

2066
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:13,580
Release the Wawa.

2067
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:16,180
Figma?

2068
02:03:16,420 --> 02:03:17,540
I don't really collect Figma.

2069
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,760
I'm such a scale figure snob, I'm sorry.

2070
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:21,640
I...

2071
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,260
I don't really collect Figmas either.

2072
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,820
I did get those snake Nendoroids.

2073
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:31,560
The snake at the right Nendoroid.

2074
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:32,900
I did get those.

2075
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:39,250
Minto is an elitist.

2076
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:44,310
When you get your own Nendo, you can make them kiss.

2077
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:46,290
If...

2078
02:03:46,290 --> 02:03:48,010
If I get my own, you know.

2079
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:53,230
When is the master grade Minto kit?

2080
02:03:55,330 --> 02:03:56,230
No Venom Nendo?

2081
02:03:56,370 --> 02:03:57,650
They didn't re-release it.

2082
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:00,170
They only re-released the...

2083
02:04:00,170 --> 02:04:02,930
But I don't think I would get a Venom one.

2084
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:08,640
Yeah, I don't think I would.

2085
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:13,500
Venom is just kind of...

2086
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:14,420
To me.

2087
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,680
Minto Nen would be 1 to 1 scale.

2088
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,580
Shut up!

2089
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:19,600
No!

2090
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:21,620
Why do you guys think I'm so small?

2091
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:35,440
This is messed up.

2092
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:36,440
Small Minky.

2093
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:40,120
Doki's Nendoroid looks so great though.

2094
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:42,000
She just had the...

2095
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,060
The colored pictures come out recently.

2096
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:46,000
I like how she has so many accessories.

2097
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:47,220
Like it kind of...

2098
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,100
Almost looks like...

2099
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:51,680
Because you can add Kroaky and the tomato.

2100
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:53,540
Like it looks really full.

2101
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:54,780
I like it a lot.

2102
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:56,520
Smaller than JPEG.

2103
02:04:58,840 --> 02:04:59,120
No!

2104
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:01,360
I'm 149 centimeters!

2105
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:09,040
A perfectly replicated smug.

2106
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:09,340
Yeah!

2107
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,180
Would yours come with Frogbert?

2108
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:13,400
I don't know.

2109
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:17,120
I don't know what I would get for accessories.

2110
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,400
Well, I would have to get a Wisp, right?

2111
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:23,640
I would want one of you guys crying.

2112
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,660
149 millimeters.

2113
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:28,320
No!

2114
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:44,250
Eyepatch.

2115
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:44,950
True.

2116
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:50,840
Maybe a box too.

2117
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:54,600
A cardboard box.

2118
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:55,540
Well, I don't know.

2119
02:05:56,020 --> 02:05:57,760
Maybe I wouldn't want to choose that as my accessory.

2120
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:59,300
Unless I can like...

2121
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:02,160
Unless...

2122
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:03,400
Because you can always make your own.

2123
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:04,660
You heard her.

2124
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,800
She's 1.49 centimeters.

2125
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:07,740
No!

2126
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:11,180
My dog...

2127
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:12,800
JPEG dog cutout is bigger.

2128
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:16,800
You have a cutout of the JPEG dog?

2129
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:20,180
Just a box.

2130
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:22,540
Small copy of Metal Gear.

2131
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,440
What expressions would you guys want?

2132
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:29,740
What expressions?

2133
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:31,520
Maybe like a wink?

2134
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:35,960
Mint is like grandma's homemade food.

2135
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:37,200
Puts a smile on your face.

2136
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:37,720
Full of love.

2137
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:38,440
Everyone likes it.

2138
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,260
And don't forget...

2139
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:44,220
She's spicy.

2140
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:51,630
I do 555...

2141
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:53,310
Oh my god, why is it so big?

2142
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:55,670
That's too big for a dog!

2143
02:06:57,110 --> 02:06:58,110
Disgusted face?

2144
02:06:58,590 --> 02:06:59,250
What, like...

2145
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:04,450
Like this one?

2146
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:10,270
Heart pupils?

2147
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:11,750
I don't even have those.

2148
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,540
I don't even have those!

2149
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:39,360
Disgusted, disappointed face.

2150
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:40,500
You guys are such freaks.

2151
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:43,980
You guys are such freaks.

2152
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,180
The cat eyes.

2153
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:55,400
That would be good too, right?

2154
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,440
Makes me wish that they...

2155
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:02,520
Actually, if they ever have a Koharu Nendoroid...

2156
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,480
Nendoroid, you can just swap the face.

2157
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,560
You can just be like...

2158
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:12,930
You can just swap it!

2159
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:27,770
Execution.

2160
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:29,410
Death penalty.

2161
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:36,540
Bandana, eyepatch, tranquil and cardboard box.

2162
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:38,780
Minifigure of snake.

2163
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:41,500
Gehe, Ojiisan face.

2164
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,220
That's just my normal.

2165
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:46,720
That's just my normal.

2166
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:50,300
I don't know.

2167
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:52,540
I have lots of time to think about it, I suppose.

2168
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:56,940
When I was talking to someone earlier, I was like...

2169
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:00,040
I was like, I'm always thinking of stuff.

2170
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:02,880
But then when it comes time to actually like...

2171
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:03,620
Be like, okay.

2172
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:06,460
Think of something and we'll do it.

2173
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:07,300
I'm like...

2174
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:16,660
Like I've been thinking of...

2175
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:17,360
Next merch?

2176
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:18,500
Hot dog.

2177
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:19,500
Hot dog indeed!

2178
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:24,560
Your chibi model is literally like 90% Nendo.

2179
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:25,140
True!

2180
02:09:28,220 --> 02:09:29,360
Thank you for the great stream.

2181
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,500
It was a great way to end the week.

2182
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:31,700
Thank you, Kuya!

2183
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,860
Show the JPEG dog later after stream.

2184
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:36,480
Okay, good.

2185
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:37,160
I wanna see it.

2186
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:39,720
You should bring it to Half-Kai.

2187
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,240
Next merch.

2188
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:43,020
I know, right?

2189
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:44,720
Already thinking.

2190
02:09:51,190 --> 02:09:53,730
I want you guys to get the plushie first though.

2191
02:09:58,360 --> 02:09:59,760
Chibi Minto Nendo.

2192
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,380
I would have to ask...

2193
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:06,060
The artist of Chibi Minto...

2194
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:07,980
If they would be okay with...

2195
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:10,260
Turning...

2196
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,440
With using their art though, you know?

2197
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:17,080
Obviously, I feel Ayami Mama would be okay.

2198
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:20,280
But...

2199
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,440
For Chibi Minto, might be different.

2200
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:24,580
Amuri!

2201
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:29,980
Happy birthday, Amuri!

2202
02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:34,740
Happy birthday!

2203
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:40,480
Myakama!

2204
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,040
Hello, hello, hello!

2205
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:43,880
Alright, Mac.

2206
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:44,860
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2207
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:52,450
Everybody say happy birthday to Amuri.

2208
02:10:53,370 --> 02:10:53,910

Thanks for the gifted!

We're the Dayon Burais and we're here to make your day jolly.

02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:18,570
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2213
02:11:19,470 --> 02:11:20,190
Thank you guys.

2214
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:21,150
Thank you, thank you.

2215
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:23,750
Hope you had fun.

2216
02:11:24,630 --> 02:11:26,810
You looked so sexy in your...

2217
02:11:28,910 --> 02:11:29,450
Towel.

2218
02:11:33,390 --> 02:11:34,750
Gonna be in the replies.

2219
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:36,050
Okay, I'll look for it.

2220
02:11:37,290 --> 02:11:37,790
Audio!

2221
02:11:38,070 --> 02:11:39,290
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

2222
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:39,950
Phantom!

2223
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:41,630
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

2224
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:48,870
The birthday outfit, yeah.

2225
02:11:49,830 --> 02:11:52,590
Everybody should go see Amuri's...

2226
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:55,710
Amuri's...

2227
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:57,730
Shopkeeper, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2228
02:11:58,150 --> 02:11:59,550
Thank you guys for all the gifted.

2229
02:11:59,650 --> 02:12:00,750
I really appreciate it.

2230
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:04,830
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2231
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:07,530
Yeah, Amuri's, large Amuri's.

2232
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:09,250
Yeah.

2233
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:11,930
Sorry, if you're just like...

2234
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:13,470
Ah, Minto, I need...

2235
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:15,910
I need a little bit of fan service here.

2236
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:16,270
Minto!

2237
02:12:16,750 --> 02:12:17,810
Minto, please!

2238
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:18,630
Minto!

2239
02:12:19,050 --> 02:12:20,150
Give me anything, Minto!

2240
02:12:20,490 --> 02:12:23,430
If you need something like that to satisfy you.

2241
02:12:23,610 --> 02:12:24,370
It's okay, I understand.

2242
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:26,290
You

2243
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:37,640
mean very nice.

2244
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:38,000
Stop!

2245
02:12:41,980 --> 02:12:43,100
Thigh is next.

2246
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:47,380
But I'm standing.

2247
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:55,380
You know what fan service you could give me.

2248
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:57,260
Actually, I don't...

2249
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:58,600
Orca, I don't...

2250
02:12:58,600 --> 02:12:59,640
I'm scared.

2251
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:04,340
I'm scared what you mean by that.

2252
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:06,780
Here, I'll do...

2253
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:08,940
I'll back away from your table.

2254
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:12,500
There we go.

2255
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:17,900
I love my washboard.

2256
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:18,420
Wait!

2257
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:20,340
Don't say a washboard!

2258
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:35,340
Wiggle, wiggle.

2259
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:37,040
Yellow middle.

2260
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:39,660
That's the best of what you are.

2261
02:13:39,980 --> 02:13:41,100
I love your eggs.

2262
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:42,820
White and tender.

2263
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:44,800
Surround the center.

2264
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:48,220
Cozy, sitting in their crackling shells.

2265
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:48,940
I love you!

2266
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:53,440
Be careful when ordering from Good Smile website.

2267
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:54,160
Oh yeah!

2268
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:57,940
I think they got something up with it.

2269
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:00,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2270
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:02,300
That is justice.

2271
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:03,880
It's a status symbol.

2272
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:07,020
But yeah, be careful.

2273
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:08,360
I don't know if it's fixed.

2274
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:09,980
Yeah, I don't know.

2275
02:14:10,660 --> 02:14:12,260
Good Smile US in particular.

2276
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:18,700
Vitamins and minerals in you.

2277
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:20,980
Oodles of the proteins too.

2278
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:22,340
Oodles, doodles.

2279
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,500
Wait, let me look up the lyrics.

2280
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:29,220
Eggs.

2281
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:29,500
Egg song.

2282
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:37,840
What?

2283
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:38,760
Eggs.

2284
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:40,020
Eggs.

2285
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:41,840
Get your eggs here.

2286
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:48,220
Fresh and white eggs are here.

2287
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:53,460
Wiggle, jiggle.

2288
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,380
Yellow middle.

2289
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,180
That's the best of what you are.

2290
02:14:58,640 --> 02:14:59,700
Wait, vitamins.

2291
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:00,100
Wait.

2292
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:01,260
Oodles.

2293
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:07,760
Popular and perfect and so complete in every way.

2294
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:09,360
I love you egg, egg.

2295
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:10,980
Come into my tummy.

2296
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:12,780
Oh, so very yummy.

2297
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:14,360
Crack, crack, crack.

2298
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:17,840
Chip a chip away your shell and come to me.

2299
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:19,800
Get your eggs.

2300
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:22,100
I love you fresh egg.

2301
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:23,960
I love you white eggs.

2302
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:25,440
Really, really love you.

2303
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,380
So eggs, fresh, fresh eggs.

2304
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:29,180
Eggs, I really love you.

2305
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:31,780
Like the sky above.

2306
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,440
Eggs are the best.

2307
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:36,500
I love you fresh egg.

2308
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,300
I love you white egg.

2309
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,900
Really, really love you.

2310
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
So eggs, fresh, fresh eggs.

2311
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,120
365 days.

2312
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:46,100
I really love you so.

2313
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:49,700
I really love you so.

2314
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:51,960
Yummy.

2315
02:15:56,590 --> 02:15:57,670
Egg song.

2316
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:01,730
Egg song.

2317
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:10,210
What a flashback.

2318
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:13,370
There's a Korean version too.

2319
02:16:14,570 --> 02:16:15,990
Oh wait, I think I know that actually.

2320
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:20,310
I think I knew that.

2321
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:28,540
Heard you're strong Mint.

2322
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:29,820
I am strong.

2323
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,660
Remember the milk and cereal song.

2324
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:36,360
No, I don't know that one.

2325
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:39,810
You know another song I sing a lot though from that era is...

2326
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:43,240
The Magical Trevor.

2327
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:46,980
Everybody loves Magical Trevor.

2328
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,420
Cause the tricks that he does are ever so clever.

2329
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,880
Look at him now, disappearing the cow.

2330
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:55,540
Where is the cow?

2331
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:57,160
Hidden right now.

2332
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:00,460
Taking a bow is Magical Trevor.

2333
02:17:07,030 --> 02:17:08,130
I don't remember.

2334
02:17:12,470 --> 02:17:13,550
And then...

2335
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:17,070
I still like...

2336
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:23,990
There's the other one that I sometimes sing to my cat.

2337
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:27,050
Oh.

2338
02:17:27,270 --> 02:17:30,710
He is back and he's got a new trick.

2339
02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:35,010
Magical Trevor is ten times slick as the last time.

2340
02:17:35,210 --> 02:17:37,330
The last time you saw him.

2341
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:40,890
Now you can see why I really adore him.

2342
02:17:41,090 --> 02:17:42,670
I say that except about my cat.

2343
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:46,170
Like when my cat walks into a room I go...

2344
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:49,570
He's back and he's got a new trick.

2345
02:17:55,450 --> 02:17:58,230
The lack of bounce is almost impressive.

2346
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:00,570
I have a really good bra.

2347
02:18:00,570 --> 02:18:01,410
Okay.

2348
02:18:04,970 --> 02:18:06,290
I have a really good bra.

2349
02:18:11,690 --> 02:18:13,110
That's what Doki said too.

2350
02:18:14,470 --> 02:18:16,590
We probably shop at the same place.

2351
02:18:17,450 --> 02:18:20,350
We probably have the same papa.

2352
02:18:22,770 --> 02:18:24,570
We're probably related.

2353
02:18:26,710 --> 02:18:28,930
Can I kindly request a cover of Numa Numa?

2354
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:31,450
I think I've sung it in karaoke before.

2355
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:35,330
I think I've sung Numa Numa in karaoke.

2356
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:45,970
People's

2357
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:50,420
bras.

2358
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:52,520
Or something.

2359
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:55,680
Seems like you do this...

2360
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:01,940
Mushroom, mushroom.

2361
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:04,720
Snake, it's a snake.

2362
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:06,960
It's a snake.

2363
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:10,760
All the internet.

2364
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:15,480
I unfortunately had free reign.

2365
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:18,260
During that time.

2366
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:26,900
2000's meme karaoke.

2367
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:28,960
That'd be fun.

2368
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:33,720
The ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny.

2369
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:38,300
You guys are so old.

2370
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,340
You guys are so old.

2371
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:45,080
Stop.

2372
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:57,840
You too.

2373
02:19:58,340 --> 02:19:59,960
No, I'm a ghost.

2374
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:01,180
I'm not aging.

2375
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:02,140
I'm forever 19.

2376
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:04,660
What's your age?

2377
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:12,840
I saw... what was it?

2378
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:16,240
Something the other day that I saw that was like...

2379
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:19,180
It was like some boomer tweet that was like...

2380
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:20,720
You guys don't understand.

2381
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:24,680
Memes back in the day lasted a whole year.

2382
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:26,700
They didn't last a week.

2383
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:30,280
Memes back in the day meant something.

2384
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:34,060
I wonder why.

2385
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:36,960
I'm tired of pretending I'm not old.

2386
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:37,880
I'm old.

2387
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:38,020
I'm old.

2388
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:41,980
Good luck at the concert, Minta.

2389
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:44,700
I'll be traveling unfortunately, so I can't attend, but I'll be cheering for you.

2390
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:45,520
Thank you, Andrew!

2391
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:50,180
Why do memes like... It's so crazy.

2392
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:53,180
There was like that chill dog that was recent.

2393
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:57,480
Do you think she's aware that Niel C.

2394
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:59,840
Cierga created ultimate battle and busting?

2395
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:01,100
No way!

2396
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:04,480
No way.

2397
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:04,620
There

2398
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:11,020
was like that chill dog.

2399
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:15,520
And then like two days later, people were like, okay, it's over.

2400
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:16,820
The meme is done.

2401
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:17,960
I was like, what?

2402
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:21,000
I just saw this guy for like the first time today.

2403
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:23,940
What do you mean it's done?

2404
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:26,900
What do you mean?

2405
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:32,800
All your base... base... all your base are blondies.

2406
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:36,100
Oh...

2407
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:38,960
Chill dog was kind of annoying though.

2408
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:39,940
Wait, why?

2409
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:43,300
Why was he annoying?

2410
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:44,540
He was so chill.

2411
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:49,460
He got turned into crypto.

2412
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:50,040
What?

2413
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:56,460
Everything... All... All memes turn into crypto.

2414
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:57,140
What happens?

2415
02:21:57,540 --> 02:21:58,760
Why does this happen?

2416
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:04,240
Misuse.

2417
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:07,540
Social media has killed memes faster than in the past.

2418
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:08,520
Nori!

2419
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:10,020
Welcome to memboyshop.

2420
02:22:10,220 --> 02:22:10,740
Thank you.

2421
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:21,060
But it's crazy because like a lot of the older memes have like... I don't want to say survived, but they've...

2422
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:22,540
They've carried on.

2423
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:23,800
They've carried, you know?

2424
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:29,160
Like some of the older ones, like... I mean, Rickroll for example.

2425
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:32,800
Like...

2426
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:33,880
That's so funny.

2427
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:35,100
This is Sparta.

2428
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:40,020
No!

2429
02:22:41,740 --> 02:22:42,780
That's what I hear.

2430
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:47,560
That's actually what I think of every time I hear Sons of Sparta in DMC.

2431
02:22:49,340 --> 02:22:50,300
Oh gosh.

2432
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:52,860
We need to bring back I'm on fire in Malaysia.

2433
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:54,720
We need to bring that back.

2434
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:00,020
I'm... Oh, you guys, you guys.

2435
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:02,640
The game.

2436
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:09,340
You guys just lost it.

2437
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:10,840
Oh no.

2438
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:20,980
So bad.

2439
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:22,220
Maybe, you know what?

2440
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:23,700
Maybe we don't need to bring it back.

2441
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,920
Maybe we're fine.

2442
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:37,400
It's only been a week since I lost it.

2443
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:48,800
Why?

2444
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:06,460
No!

2445
02:24:06,460 --> 02:24:07,520
It's kind of funny.

2446
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:09,680
I didn't really watch any of those.

2447
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,200
Like the Team Four Star and stuff like that.

2448
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:18,040
The Yu-Gi-Oh and the Dragon Ball Z ones.

2449
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:20,620
I never... It's funny because I was so into Yu-Gi-Oh.

2450
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:23,240
I was so into Dragon Ball and just never really watched them.

2451
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:25,580
John, thank you so much for the birthday gift!

2452
02:24:26,140 --> 02:24:27,720
Oh my gosh, thank you!

2453
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:29,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2454
02:24:30,700 --> 02:24:32,080
Thank you so much!

2455
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:36,200
How?

2456
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:36,880
I don't know.

2457
02:24:36,980 --> 02:24:38,340
I just... I don't know.

2458
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:39,500
I just never watched them.

2459
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:44,040
I can't remember what else I was watching back then.

2460
02:24:52,940 --> 02:24:54,560
DBZA, watch a long one.

2461
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:01,160
Maybe I was watching Homestar Runner.

2462
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:04,180
Maybe.

2463
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:04,260
Maybe.

2464
02:25:17,580 --> 02:25:18,620
Hold on.

2465
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:19,960
I'm gonna bring out another meme.

2466
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,540
You know, I died when I was 19.

2467
02:25:41,850 --> 02:25:43,190
Thank God, too.

2468
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:45,230
Can you imagine if I died earlier?

2469
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:53,690
At least I can legally buy... I've died forever 19, so I could forever watch and play Eroge.

2470
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:57,290
And buy Doujin.

2471
02:25:59,790 --> 02:26:01,590
I'm so glad that I died.

2472
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:08,130
You know, and thought about that.

2473
02:26:10,370 --> 02:26:16,370
I mean, I didn't think about that, but you know, it's so convenient that that's...

2474
02:26:19,030 --> 02:26:22,010
That I died at such an age.

2475
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:23,590
Thank goodness, right?

2476
02:26:26,630 --> 02:26:28,390
She can't drink in the US.

2477
02:26:29,350 --> 02:26:29,690
True?

2478
02:26:31,630 --> 02:26:35,070
And I... But I don't really drink, so...

2479
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:39,170
Remember Weeble and Bop?

2480
02:26:39,630 --> 02:26:41,130
I know Weeble's stuff.

2481
02:26:42,490 --> 02:26:43,470
I'm so glad that I died.

2482
02:26:43,570 --> 02:26:43,670
Hello?

2483
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:47,410
Or in Japan either.

2484
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:48,270
Oh, true!

2485
02:26:50,690 --> 02:26:55,810
I was literally typing this super about to mention I'm a fire in my laser and then he said it.

2486
02:26:55,850 --> 02:26:56,670
Please get out of my head.

2487
02:26:56,730 --> 02:26:58,150
Get out of my head!

2488
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:00,850
She can in Germany.

2489
02:27:01,470 --> 02:27:01,770
Okay.

2490
02:27:01,770 --> 02:27:04,150
What about Austria?

2491
02:27:07,410 --> 02:27:09,370
You can in most of Europe.

2492
02:27:09,450 --> 02:27:10,190
Let's go.

2493
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:12,950
Wait, what's the drinking age in Canada?

2494
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:18,980
Most of Europe is 18 plus.

2495
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:19,920
Let's go.

2496
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:26,420
19.

2497
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:29,440
See?

2498
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:34,320
If I want to drink, I just go somewhere else.

2499
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:40,580
I just leave the country for a drink.

2500
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:43,540
Easy peasy.

2501
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:49,780
Basematara.

2502
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:51,140
No.

2503
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:52,920
Oh god, no.

2504
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:57,340
Mentally, I'm in the EU.

2505
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:59,060
What do you mean by that?

2506
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:01,280
What do you mean by that?

2507
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:06,660
Visit Doki.

2508
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:07,960
Oh gosh.

2509
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:11,780
You guys are not making it much better.

2510
02:28:12,580 --> 02:28:15,060
Official Minto Eroge recommendation list when?

2511
02:28:19,470 --> 02:28:24,150
I couldn't recommend you much recent stuff though because I haven't played much recently.

2512
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,370
You know?

2513
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:26,470
Sad.

2514
02:28:27,270 --> 02:28:27,850
So sad.

2515
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:35,940
There was... I don't know if I ever said this.

2516
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:42,800
But before I graduated those years ago, you know?

2517
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:45,400
I got offered...

2518
02:28:46,740 --> 02:28:50,740
I got offered a Steam key for an Eroge.

2519
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:54,940
And I was like, yo, let's go.

2520
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:57,420
I haven't played it yet.

2521
02:28:58,660 --> 02:28:59,260
Graduated.

2522
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:02,540
Yeah, like, you know, I graduated and then I came back.

2523
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:04,720
I graduated and went to heaven and then I came back.

2524
02:29:05,860 --> 02:29:06,780
Did you play it?

2525
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:08,420
I played... Actually, that's a lie.

2526
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:09,520
I played a little bit of it.

2527
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:11,120
But I didn't, like, finish.

2528
02:29:12,220 --> 02:29:14,800
Wait, in more ways than one.

2529
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:15,560
No, I'm just kidding.

2530
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:23,820
But it's funny because the name is called Kiara and My Ara Ara Adventure.

2531
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:29,820
I just got an email one day and they were like, hey, we're gonna give you this code.

2532
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:35,960
And I'm like, I can't stream this.

2533
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:38,500
But thank you.

2534
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,780
Kiara and My Ara Ara Adventure.

2535
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:42,660
So it's funny.

2536
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:48,320
So now, you know, I would be like, we need like a Kiwawa mod for it.

2537
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:55,120
Let's see.

2538
02:29:55,220 --> 02:29:55,500
Hold on.

2539
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:56,500
If I go to the store...

2540
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:58,680
Store page.

2541
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:00,980
Has very positive reviews.

2542
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:06,160
I could write a review.

2543
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:10,300
But I would have to check the box because I received the product for free.

2544
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:14,840
I just wanted you to have it.

2545
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:17,140
Yeah, I was like, kind of surprised.

2546
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:18,500
I was like, oh...

2547
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:20,420
Thank you.

2548
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:32,540
I was like, oh, okay, I'll take it.

2549
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:36,200
It's like a, like a cat girl lady.

2550
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,000
Sorry,

2551
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:46,340
you heard nothing?

2552
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:47,920
You didn't hear that?

2553
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:10,560
Guys, thanks for today's stream.

2554
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,780
I'm glad we could beat Merry Gear Solid.

2555
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:17,180
And, of course, I'll do Merry Gear Solid 2 another day.

2556
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:20,780
Maybe more towards Christmas when I, you know...

2557
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:22,860
We'll beat it.

2558
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:24,220
We'll beat that.

2559
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:27,400
And we'll... yeah.

2560
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:29,020
Yeah.

2561
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:30,880
Sorry, that was for my PC.

2562
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:34,460
What are you doing while you're watching me stream, huh?

2563
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:37,720
Put that away.

2564
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:46,960
I didn't realize that was your cue to... wait, that was my cue... wait.

2565
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:48,180
The cue.

2566
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:51,120
To believe me.

2567
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:52,300
Believe me!

2568
02:31:57,100 --> 02:31:58,300
Eating stroganoff?

2569
02:31:58,380 --> 02:31:59,460
Oh, that sounds great.

2570
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:00,960
I'm hungry too.

2571
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:02,420
I'm gonna go eat dinner.

2572
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:04,820
I'm gonna go eat dinner.

2573
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:05,920
Put that away.

2574
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:07,080
The program.

2575
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:10,160
The game.

2576
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:13,980
Your Ara Ara adventure.

2577
02:32:19,780 --> 02:32:22,420
Yeah, thanks for the tech gift.

2578
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:24,740
Thank you.

2579
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:28,880
Ghost never hungry.

2580
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:30,160
Ghost always hungry.

2581
02:32:30,380 --> 02:32:31,180
I'm always hungry.

2582
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:34,500
Otsumito everybody, thank you.

2583
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:39,160
Maybe, you know what, maybe tonight I'll play the Ara Ara adventure and I'll tell you guys all about it.

2584
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:40,140
How about that?

2585
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:48,860
They were like, man, we really... all those years ago, four years ago, we really wished Mint would play the game and talk about it on stream.

2586
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:50,580
I'll tell you all about it.

2587
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:52,800
I'll tell you all about my adventure.

2588
02:32:53,900 --> 02:32:55,940
I did start a new book recently.

2589
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:56,820
I think.

2590
02:32:57,160 --> 02:32:58,020
Hold on, let me see.

2591
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:06,200
What was it?

2592
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:08,440
I think... oh, I listened to it.

2593
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:10,500
I fell asleep like five minutes in.

2594
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:13,280
It was my minotaur husband.

2595
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:18,760
I literally can't tell you a single thing about this.

2596
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:23,700
No, I can't tell you a single thing about this book because I fell asleep.

2597
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,860
I fell asleep immediately.

2598
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:31,500
I put it on and went...

2599
02:33:34,820 --> 02:33:35,900
My minotaur husband.

2600
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:36,920
Here, let's see what it's about.

2601
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:53,360
Celeste is one of only a hundred remaining humans on Earth, living on a secured preserve away from many dangerous monsters out in the world.

2602
02:33:54,280 --> 02:34:00,860
But some monsters desperately want human companions, and they'll abide by all the strict rules and requirements to get one.

2603
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:05,300
Celeste has applications piling up from those who want to court her.

2604
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:09,280
But she's afraid of taking the leap... until Theo.

2605
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:16,200
Theo, the minotaur, is shy, gentle, and kind, and wants nothing more than a human wife to spoil.

2606
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:30,940
When Celeste agrees to move in and start a trial marriage, he'll do anything in his power to keep her happy and safe in a world where a human might make a great meal for another monster.

2607
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:34,060
The only problem?

2608
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:42,620
Theo is huge... in more than one way.

2609
02:34:56,690 --> 02:35:00,690
And he knows Celeste isn't ready for him yet.

2610
02:35:01,650 --> 02:35:04,430
It will take trust and time to prepare her.

2611
02:35:07,570 --> 02:35:10,310
She's a roast.

2612
02:35:13,810 --> 02:35:16,190
We must prepare the turkey.

2613
02:35:18,730 --> 02:35:26,750
As they start to build their new life together, and it might just lead to falling in love.

2614
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:35,360
Oh, prepare the turkey.

2615
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:40,820
Make me boneless like one of your French girls.

2616
02:35:40,820 --> 02:35:46,340
So yeah, maybe I'll listen to this and I'll play Chiara's Ara Ara Adventure.

2617
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:51,740
Sounds like Celeste will need some ointment.

2618
02:35:59,330 --> 02:36:01,530
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2619
02:36:01,570 --> 02:36:03,090
I'll see you guys later.

2620
02:36:03,790 --> 02:36:10,830
This week, you know, this week coming up, a little more off days, not streaming days.

2621
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:17,150
Because I'm going to Atlanta and then also doing a concert, so...

2622
02:36:18,170 --> 02:36:19,090
Busy, busy.

2623
02:36:19,530 --> 02:36:21,310
But I'll see you guys later!

2624
02:36:22,830 --> 02:36:24,230
Hello minto, hello!

2625
02:36:28,290 --> 02:36:29,330
Bye bye!

2626
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:30,710
Thanks for streaming!

2627
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:33,310
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!
