1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,760
Uh, is it live?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,680
I can't tell.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,060
Uh, oh, I think so.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,460
Sorry.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm nervous.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,260
Hello, everybody.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,180
Hi.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,840
Oh, gosh.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,140
I'm nervous.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh, I don't, I'm not used to stuff like this.

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,000
Um, I wanted to, I wanted to keep this kind of short.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,100
I just, um, uh, wanted to clear up some stuff.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,660
Uh, um, uh, things that I could tell you guys.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,680
Kind of giving you a little more context.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,000
Um, so a little more behind the scenes.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:59,220
A little more, um, uh, reasoning as to, um, some things happening.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,420
Uh, I'm so sorry for doing this.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,820
I really hate, um, kind of, uh, I, I, I would hope that you guys know that.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,480
I don't like to get myself involved in these types of things unless I'm truly actually involved.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Um, and if, and I felt that this sort of, uh, impacted my, um, streaming activities, uh, enough that I should probably make a statement.

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,060
And, um, and, um, and I'm just gonna be pretty frank with you guys.

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,760
And I'm not gonna be, um, you know, I'm going to just kind of tell you guys how things are.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,580
And, um, yeah.

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:50,860
So, uh, first I kind of want to give you guys a bit of a timeline of, um, how, how things were with me, um, and my relationship with Bishoujo.

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,020
Because I don't make this stream lightly.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,680
Um, so, uh, last year I did the podcast, um, with Matara.

27
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:10,820
Um, and at that time, uh, I was not, um, I was only working with Bishoujo.

28
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,000
I was not in Bishoujo as a member.

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,740
Um, and, uh, you know, we released merch and things like that.

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:29,120
Um, I do want to mention I, uh, did not receive, um, money for that, uh, from any of the merch drop.

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,480
Um, but I, uh, you know, it wasn't really about that for me.

32
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,300
So I, um, you know, just kind of wrote it off.

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:46,780
And, you know, Matara and I, we did, uh, from the, we, we have the money from the Patreon itself.

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,240
So it was just the merchandise that we did not get paid for.

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:03,800
But, um, uh, you know, I, I, I, I'm trying to figure out how to say this without it sounding too embarrassing.

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:15,340
Um, you know, uh, last year, um, in, like, mid-podcast time that we were recording, um, we had gone to Japan together.

37
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,080
And we had gotten COVID together and we were stuck in a hotel together.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:30,760
Um, and at that time, I kind of was talking to Matara and I was saying how I, um, how I was, uh, sorry.

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:40,160
Uh, how I, um, was just feeling pretty lonely and how I, um,

40
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:50,260
uh, sorry, was feeling how I, um, was really wanting to join a group or a company.

41
00:03:51,340 --> 00:04:03,340
And, um, you know, how, you know, V Shoujo would, would be good, but it wasn't exactly goal oriented towards the things I wanted to do.

42
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:17,440
And, um, in that, on that trip, we had the idea, or we came up with the idea where, um, potentially I could pitch an idol group, Jen, to V Shoujo.

43
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,900
Oh my gosh, it's so weird saying this out loud to you guys right now.

44
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,640
Um, because I've, you know, haven't really told anybody this entire time.

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,040
And so, um, uh, I pitched that to them.

46
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,880
And, um, actually, Gunrun and I, uh, knew each other even before I became a VTuber.

47
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,760
Um, we connected through idols.

48
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,400
And so he seemed very keen about the idea.

49
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:54,200
And so, um, from then I had signed on as a member, technically.

50
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:10,860
And, um, and, uh, they auditioned for, um, two other members that were going to be, um, that were going to be, uh, a part of the group.

51
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,500
The idol group that we would form.

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:23,460
And, um, so I believe some other people were coming out about their experiences, like, uh, Barry and Pia.

53
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,780
Um, they were not a part of, uh, what I was working on.

54
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,040
They were supposed to be, uh, uh, debuted after us.

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:48,040
And, um, one thing that, uh, I felt very confident in was, um, who we were working with, uh, in Vishojo.

56
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,640
Um, our group actually worked mostly with the JP side of Vishojo.

57
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:03,300
And, um, uh, things, things were, albeit a bit slow.

58
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,380
Um, things were not bad.

59
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,460
Um, and, uh,

60
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,440
uh, sorry.

61
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:41,390
Um, I just was really happy that, um, I was working towards a common goal with, um, two other people that, uh, I was really excited to, um, be with.

62
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:56,970
And, um, uh, um, uh, they were, the staff were really, really good to us, I do want to say.

63
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:09,630
Um, and, uh, there were a lot of, um, opportunities that were lining up.

64
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,270
Um, and some that, probably,

65
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,360
probably will never come to fruition, but that's okay.

66
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
And, uh, sorry.

67
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:42,560
And, um, so, we actually were initially supposed to, um, debut a while ago, but things kept getting pushed back, pushed back, pushed back.

68
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:51,580
Which, you know, was understandable at first, but it kind of got a little frustrating with planning certain projects.

69
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:12,470
And, um, uh, um, I'm trying to, sorry, I'm trying to gather my thoughts so I can give you guys a more transparent idea of what's happening, but also not get in legal trouble.

70
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:28,750
Um, but, um, uh, they, V Shoujo also helped with my, uh, merch drop that I did after Mosul Box with, like, the mugs and stuff.

71
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:48,750
Um, I also did not see that money, but I, again, I was so confident about my, you know, my group working out that I, I, sorry.

72
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,810
It wasn't really about that, and I just, you know, kind of said it, it'll be okay, it'll work out.

73
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,160
And, um, sorry.

74
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:16,380
Uh, so, um, I do want to say, though, that, um, please, you know, obviously support all the talents.

75
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,080
Everybody's kind of going through it.

76
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm sorry, it's, I, I am, um, you know, wasn't an, I wasn't an outward-facing talent, but I guess I was a talent for over a year now, I guess.

77
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:44,700
But, um, but also a lot of the staff are kind of, um, a lot of the, uh, former, uh, staff and a lot of people were, they were really good people.

78
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,800
Um, a lot of them did not know about what was happening until, uh, very recently.

79
00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:07,700
And so, um, uh, our team that we were working with, they told us, they said, you know, we, we want you to, to know what's going on.

80
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:17,140
Um, and it was, it was a lot, um, and, uh, that's now kind of where we're at present day.

81
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,320
Um, basically everything has, uh, there was, yeah, there was a lot of stuff that was being planned.

82
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:44,420
And, um, I'm really sorry that, um, I, uh, I, uh, don't have really anything for you guys anymore at the moment.

83
00:10:44,420 --> 00:11:00,060
Um, but, um, but I can say my, um, my 3D, uh, sorry, 3D debut concert should still happen.

84
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:09,020
Um, and the JP staff were really, really amazing to help that make that happen for me.

85
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,760
Um, and,

86
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,610
yeah, um, I don't really know what else to say.

87
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,350
I didn't want to make this very long anyway.

88
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,450
I just kind of wanted to get this off my chest so I could move forward.

89
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,570
And I'm sorry for, uh, sorry.

90
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,390
I'm sorry for, um, causing this kind of trouble.

91
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,950
And, you know, I like to just keep the vibes good on my channel.

92
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,410
But I felt this was kind of important to bring up.

93
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,470
And so, um,

94
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,380
yeah, I just kind of wanted to, uh, you know, I didn't want to drag this out.

95
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,680
And I'm sorry also for bringing this up as well when there's already so many people coming out about things.

96
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,340
Um, and so much talk.

97
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:26,540
But, um, uh, thank you guys for, for being here for me.

98
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,120
And I hope that you guys can give you support for everybody else as well.

99
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,800
And, um,

100
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,200
yeah, sorry.

101
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,940
Okay, I think that's all I really needed to say.

102
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,740
I hope that, that cleared some things up for you.

103
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:55,220
Um, and I, you know, it's really unfortunate that nobody knew how bad it was.

104
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,020
Except the people who knew how bad it was.

105
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,180
And they were just kind of willing to let everyone else walk into a burning building.

106
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:16,100
And, um, you know, I don't, I, everybody that I worked with was really amazing.

107
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:33,560
And, um, so I, uh, I'm just really sad that it didn't, you know, have a chance to, to even, even see the light of day.

108
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,820
But, um, yeah, uh, sorry.

109
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,780
Um, thank you for taking the time to listen to me.

110
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,300
And, um, uh, I will continue doing my best.

111
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:00,900
And hopefully, um, you know, hopefully something will happen for me one day.

112
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,160
Um, we'll see.

113
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,560
I, you know, I really am not good at marketing myself.

114
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,460
Or doing anything like that.

115
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,880
I, so I was really excited about having a company that could help me with opportunities.

116
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,680
And having a group of friends that I could stream with again.

117
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:45,720
And, um, but, uh, uh, uh, if, I, I guess, you know, the delayed and delays and debut were more of a blessing in disguise.

118
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,820
And, um, I wouldn't be able to do all the things that I can do at the moment without you guys.

119
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,420
So, thank you very much.

120
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,500
And thank you for listening.

121
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,120
Have a good day.

122
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,060
Have a good night.

123
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,520
Thank you.
