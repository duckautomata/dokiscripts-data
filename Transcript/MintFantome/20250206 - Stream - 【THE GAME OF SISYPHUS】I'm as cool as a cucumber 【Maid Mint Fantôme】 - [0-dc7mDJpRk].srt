1
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,860
Welcome home, master.

2
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
Young lady.

3
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:25,830
Hello!

4
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,310
Hello!

5
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,230
Look out behind you.

6
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,860
I'm quick on my...oh my gosh, that one scared me.

7
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,100
Reign of balls!

8
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,600
I don't like that one.

9
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,320
Welcome to the game of Sisyphus.

10
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,280
It's a calm, totally not rage-inducing game.

11
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,060
I...I know this game.

12
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,280
There was two...

13
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,540
It was Korone and somebody else.

14
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,060
That they raced against each other.

15
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,460
And...

16
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,680
Korone got like...she like beat it.

17
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,520
And...the other member was like so, so far behind.

18
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,540
Asuki.

19
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,940
That sounds correct.

20
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,300
That sounds correct.

21
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,480
Yeah, they were like racing against each other.

22
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,800
And Asuki was...

23
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm a new viewer.

24
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,520
Good to see you.

25
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,980
Thanks, train man.

26
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,360
What's your most unhinged opinion?

27
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,840
Unhinged opinion.

28
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,180
Don't get my Oshi cancelled.

29
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,760
No!

30
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,920
It's not unhinged though.

31
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,560
It's not unhinged though.

32
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,650
Your birthday?

33
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,610
Winter Cedar, happy birthday!

34
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,930
Say it.

35
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,190
No, I was going to say...

36
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,070
Sorry, I'm really racking my brain about this.

37
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,890
I'm not delaying starting this game at all.

38
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,470
No.

39
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,980
I don't know!

40
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,020
No!

41
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,680
I was going to say ketchup and eggs.

42
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,640
It's not unhinged at all.

43
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,810
Maybe.

44
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,950
It's normal.

45
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,950
It's normal?

46
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,030
Wait, what about ketchup and mac and cheese?

47
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,030
I think I'm just hungry.

48
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,470
And Draco thinks that's what he gifted.

49
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,790
That's unhinged?

50
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,110
It's not even though.

51
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,190
It's not even though.

52
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,810
Oh, I know!

53
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,970
Maybe... Well, it's not unhinged, but...

54
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,310
I prefer stale popcorn to normal popcorn.

55
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,690
Maybe that's my... I don't know if that's unhinged enough.

56
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,810
Mia had requested months ago for a record time of beating this game.

57
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,150
Did she actually... Did Henya actually beat the game?

58
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,690
Oh yes, I'm playing a game today.

59
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:06,130
I'm playing this sissy game because my kamioshi, Henya the Genius, said you must play this game.

60
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,530
And I said I would do it.

61
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,530
Did I say when I would do it?

62
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,910
No, but...

63
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,690
I did say that I would play it.

64
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:30,450
And I brought up Korone and Asuki before because they... I think it's really only their playthrough that I ever watched of the game.

65
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,270
Because I was just watching poor Asuki cry.

66
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,730
That's so sad.

67
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,190
I'm not stalling.

68
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,550
This is how long I always take before I start games.

69
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,770
Her craziest opinion is that she actually loves Hayley Jelosman.

70
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,370
Oh, sorry.

71
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:50,990
Oh my gosh.

72
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,930
I forgot to sing Happy Birthday.

73
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:52,770
Wait, hold on.

74
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,290
Let me go up.

75
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,670
I'm so sorry.

76
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,550
Hold on.

77
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,830
Wait.

78
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

79
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,670
Winter Cedar!

80
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,370
Hold on.

81
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,490
Happy birthday to you.

82
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,750
Happy birthday to you.

83
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,310
Happy birthday, Winter Cedar.

84
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,410
Happy birthday to you.

85
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,510
Happy birthday!

86
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,550
Okay.

87
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,720
What do you mean it's not their birthday?

88
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
My unhinged opinion is that the moon...

89
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
That's an opinion.

90
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,440
Reread.

91
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,760
Oh, am I stupid?

92
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
But someone... Okay.

93
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,480
Someone said Happy Birthday.

94
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,220
Honestly, if you guys respond to someone...

95
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,560
I see that more better than if...

96
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,660
If I miss the super chat.

97
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,260
So I'll see people responding to a super chat.

98
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,240
And that's usually how I know if it's a birthday or not.

99
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,680
So if you guys say Happy Birthday to a super chat...

100
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,260
That's how I'm going to...

101
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,900
That's how I'm going to do it.

102
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,320
Let me see.

103
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,740
Okay.

104
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
Oh, today isn't my birthday.

105
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,400
Well, I sing you a happy birthday song, so...

106
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,000
So...

107
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
But congratulations!

108
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,620
You guys are now making me throw out birthday songs willy-nilly.

109
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,520
It's a sacred thing you can only give once a year.

110
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,020
Please.

111
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,400
Sorry, every time I click out of the game...

112
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,340
The music stops.

113
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,420
So, it's everybody's birthday.

114
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,300
Not today.

115
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,000
Not today!

116
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,740
Well, yeah, you used yours for this year, Winter.

117
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,580
So sorry.

118
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,140
Like any more viewers than days in a year, there are several birthdays every day.

119
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,140
I mean, I do sing pretty much every stream, I think.

120
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,340
Can you wish my friend Weepin'?

121
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,420
Are you guys just saying that now?

122
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,920
Wait, is it not their birthday?

123
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,080
Today is not my birthday.

124
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,740
Will you sing happy birthday for me anyways?

125
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,200
No!

126
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,820
Am I supposed to sing?

127
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,140
Stop saying happy birthday to everybody!

128
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
You guys are seriously going to ruin the system.

129
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,740
I should have never told you.

130
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,320
I should have never told you.

131
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,000
Now you guys are ruining it.

132
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,460
Can we just pretend it's my cat's birthday?

133
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,160
My cats before stream were going nutso.

134
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,560
Freakazoid mode.

135
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,660
So, one thing about Butaro is that...

136
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,140
That guy is kind of a bully.

137
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,540
My cat Butaro is kind of a bully.

138
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,340
And Paws is so sweet.

139
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,580
She's just like a sweetie baby little princess angel.

140
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,320
I love her.

141
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,420
So aptly named.

142
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,140
Truly.

143
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,900
And...

144
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,040
He's just...

145
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,980
Nice to meet you.

146
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,600
Nice to meet you.

147
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,480
I've seen clips of you here and there.

148
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,520
I haven't properly met you.

149
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,380
You're adorable.

150
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,700
Glad first live words I heard was your preference for stale popcorn.

151
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,620
So many new people today.

152
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,900
That's also another reason I wanted to play this game.

153
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,560
I felt that many...

154
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,900
Maybe too many clips were coming out about me...

155
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,940
You know, crashing out...

156
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,420
And cracking up.

157
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,180
I haven't cracked up in a while.

158
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,860
Rather, I need more clips of me cracking up.

159
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,540
Because I haven't cracked up in a while.

160
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,740
I'm really looking forward to cracking up.

161
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,400
It's not my birthday!

162
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,180
So I was just like, if I play a Rage game...

163
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,260
And if I'm totally super duper cool...

164
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,040
I mean, look at my glasses.

165
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,500
This is the coolest I could be.

166
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,960
But if I'm wearing my glasses...

167
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,300
And I'm acting all calm and cool and collected...

168
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,620
And I don't rage a single bit...

169
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,520
Then people will maybe also make a clip about me.

170
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,840
And they're just like, wow, look at...

171
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,700
In the face of adversity, look how she handles herself.

172
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,620
You know how there's the said calmly meme or whatever?

173
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,880
That's me, but facts.

174
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,720
It's not my birthday!

175
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,500
Stupid!

176
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,980
07, Taminto's vocal chords.

177
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,900
That's another thing.

178
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,060
I need to preserve my voice.

179
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,280
I need to stop screaming about everything, okay?

180
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,760
I need to save it for special moments, like Metal Gear.

181
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,540
Why'd you call me a pervert?

182
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,080
No, I said preserve.

183
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,500
Wait, what did I say?

184
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,630
No, I didn't.

185
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,710
I said...

186
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,860
I said preserve, right?

187
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,880
No way!

188
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,460
Wait, this isn't actually a birthday?

189
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm scared to check now, everybody.

190
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,340
Happy birthday, Taminto.

191
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,140
It's not my birthday!

192
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,980
My birthday is in August.

193
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,680
No, you have to wait, Spank.

194
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,860
I'm looking forward to a generational crashout.

195
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,820
I didn't say pervert!

196
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,800
And if I did, I'm talking about you!

197
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,120
Only a pervert would hear the word pervert come out of my lips.

198
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,680
I'm scared for the clip.

199
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm gonna unarchive this.

200
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,020
Stop, I'm already crying.

201
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,180
I already have tears in my eyes.

202
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,920
Stop it.

203
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,960
I need to pervert my voice.

204
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,560
No!

205
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,260
I said preserve!

206
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,380
Like the jam!

207
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
Like a jelly!

208
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Please understand.

209
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,280
I have a special announcement.

210
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,720
Hi.

211
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,880
Anyway, I was talking about my cats earlier too.

212
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,140
Hi, dog.

213
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm not crying because of the game.

214
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
Not yet.

215
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
I'm gonna start the game and then I'm gonna talk about my cats.

216
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,220
Only a pervert trusts his life to a woman.

217
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,640
Also, white sister Rhyme, welcome back for two months in you!

218
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,740
I have to get gold.

219
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,440
I wanted the apple.

220
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,280
I wanted the apple.

221
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,560
Okay, we'll have to...

222
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,800
A dog!

223
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,200
We'll have to aim for it.

224
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,560
Happy birthday Minto's mustache?

225
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,680
No.

226
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,900
I don't have one, do I?

227
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,840
Do I need to shave my stunning beard?

228
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,120
Did you guys notice it on stream today?

229
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,040
Did I not shave so that you could see how great my beard is?

230
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,660
Okay, we move here.

231
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,100
We run here.

232
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,220
We jump here.

233
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
Why do I need to jump anyway?

234
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,760
Camera zoom.

235
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,780
Oh, camera zoom.

236
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,840
Why am I naked?

237
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,960
I got an achievement for starting the game.

238
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,680
Chat reflects the streamer.

239
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,000
Here we go!

240
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,020
So if I like...

241
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,120
If I wanted to...

242
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,140
Okay, if I wanted to push it to the left...

243
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,360
Okay.

244
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,200
No, no.

245
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,120
I'm just testing it out real quick.

246
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,960
No, don't go that way.

247
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,360
Wait, don't go that way.

248
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:15,900
Stop.

249
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,280
Wait, no.

250
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,580
Why is it so kind of ASMR, so crackly?

251
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,460
No, stop.

252
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,920
Go up.

253
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,760
Why does it have like crazy physics?

254
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,680
It like just moves on its own.

255
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,200
Why am I moving diagonally?

256
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,040
Stop.

257
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,040
Why does it have drift?

258
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,380
What is this Joy-Con drift that it has?

259
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,120
Wait, there's an exit.

260
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,540
It's still going!

261
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:02,680
It's still going!

262
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,010
I don't think this is how it works.

263
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,870
I was only pushing it diagonally because...

264
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,910
I don't think this is how...

265
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,890
Shouldn't it...

266
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,530
Inertia?

267
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,770
What is happening?

268
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,710
Why does it keep moving?

269
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,690
Rolling girl.

270
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,230
One more time, one more time.

271
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,670
It's a very haunted ball.

272
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,870
What's E?

273
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,750
It keeps telling me to do this.

274
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,450
Push and push.

275
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,710
Let's keep going.

276
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,330
I'm not trying to push it diagonally, you guys.

277
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,290
I'm literally pushing straight.

278
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,850
And it's doing this.

279
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,710
I don't know how to change it.

280
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,170
I don't know how to change it.

281
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,490
I'm literally only pressing W.

282
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,310
I'm pressing W.

283
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,740
Mouse buttons.

284
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,460
Wait, what?

285
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,040
What do you mean mouse buttons?

286
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,540
Roll boulder left.

287
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,140
Wait, what?

288
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,760
I thought it meant left and right as in like...

289
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,900
Okay, hold on.

290
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,240
Ah, I see.

291
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,620
So that's how you balance it.

292
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,100
I got it now.

293
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,600
Okay,

294
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,300
anyway, we do need to go a little to the right.

295
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,940
Never mind, to the left.

296
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,620
Take it back now, y'all.

297
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,000
One half this time.

298
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,580
Slide to the left.

299
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,640
Slide to the right.

300
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,200
Criss-cross.

301
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,620
Criss-cross.

302
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,240
I feel like I'm worried that it will be hard to see the Super Chats and apologize in advance.

303
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,260
Oh my god.

304
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,580
I got it.

305
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
No!

306
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:46,260
I thought we had it.

307
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,460
I was talking about my cats.

308
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,600
So, Butaro is a bit of a bully.

309
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,140
And he...

310
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,860
Don't worry, I'll get used to the controls and we'll be like super, super good.

311
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,240
Nanomachine boulder.

312
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,020
And so they'll fight because Butaro wants to be licked, right?

313
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,900
He wants to be licked by Paws.

314
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,400
Because he's just a little freak like that, you know?

315
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,500
Oh wait, I did the wrong direction.

316
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:25,960
There we go.

317
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,460
And so after they fight...

318
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,300
Like 9 times out of 10, I'll also see him take over her spot.

319
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,480
You know?

320
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,220
Oh, I pressed right instead of left.

321
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,100
It's fine.

322
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,520
We're okay.

323
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,360
And so, this guy...

324
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,620
This stinking guy...

325
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,640
Also is very... He's like a possessive freak.

326
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,300
He's so rude.

327
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,420
Oh, left, left.

328
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,500
Wait, oh shoot.

329
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,540
I messed up.

330
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,020
Wait.

331
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,770
When you're like pushing one way, you have to press the mouse a different way.

332
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,550
Didn't you say he's a chill guy?

333
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,370
Not really.

334
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,890
Cat reflects the streamer?

335
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,130
No, what do you mean?

336
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,550
See?

337
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,830
I didn't press left hard enough.

338
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,050
Oh yeah...

339
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,790
But everybody struggles this much in the beginning, right?

340
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,250
Right?

341
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,690
Okay, here I go.

342
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,070
Why are you especially slow all of a sudden?

343
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:56,950
Right.

344
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:57,970
Right.

345
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,210
Right.

346
00:24:59,210 --> 00:24:59,470
Right.

347
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,750
Right.

348
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:02,610
Left.

349
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,090
But also...

350
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,190
Right, but left.

351
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,570
So that's how you balance it out, you know?

352
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,130
Oh gosh, I'm...

353
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,670
How do I...

354
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,410
Right, right, right.

355
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,210
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

356
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,070
Buddy.

357
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,430
Even it out, even it out.

358
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,190
I don't wanna go this way!

359
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,430
I don't...

360
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,110
I don't wanna go this way!

361
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,530
Okay, okay.

362
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:33,810
Alright.

363
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,390
Okay.

364
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,350
We'll just...

365
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,970
The music is kinda nice though, I like it.

366
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,890
I hope I don't get copyright struck.

367
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,830
You'll go where the ball takes you.

368
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,410
I'm taking it nice and slow.

369
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,730
Slowly, slowly.

370
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,050
Okay.

371
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,370
Slowly.

372
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,430
Okay.

373
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,770
Gosh, I feel like I can't reach out at all.

374
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,010
I feel like I have to concentrate everything.

375
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,170
I can't even scratch my face.

376
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,630
I have to have all hands on deck.

377
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,890
I have to be fully focused.

378
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,590
Fully in the zone.

379
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,810
I like this music.

380
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,970
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot.

381
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,990
It's way better than getting over it.

382
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:20,510
Okay.

383
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,190
Alright, nice.

384
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,150
You can stand still.

385
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,170
Oh, shoot.

386
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,910
But it's kinda dangerous too, I'd say.

387
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,210
Okay.

388
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,090
Alright.

389
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,070
Left.

390
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,270
Alright, nice.

391
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,110
Gotta get a little bit of hurdles here.

392
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,250
We're okay.

393
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,250
Oh, gosh.

394
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,570
Oh, left, left, left, left.

395
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,290
Left, left, left.

396
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,410
Right, right, right, right, right.

397
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,330
Right, right.

398
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,250
Left, left.

399
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,310
Right, left.

400
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,310
Right, right, right.

401
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,110
Right, right.

402
00:26:59,410 --> 00:26:59,830
Okay.

403
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,710
Oh, left.

404
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,410
Okay.

405
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,430
We got this.

406
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,510
I got my A.

407
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:05,790
Yeah.

408
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,070
I'm locked in.

409
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:07,550
I am.

410
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,410
I am.

411
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,930
Kind of.

412
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,990
Maybe not as much as I should be.

413
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,870
Don't look at ya.

414
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,450
I can't look at you guys.

415
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,550
I can't look at you guys.

416
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,750
This is my punishment.

417
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,690
Oh, I miss you guys though.

418
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:21,810
What are you guys saying?

419
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,330
What are you guys doing?

420
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,400
Are those logs?

421
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,480
How do I get past those?

422
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,300
No way.

423
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,260
There's a little tiny ramp.

424
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,320
Are you kidding me right now?

425
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,640
No way.

426
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,320
Game.

427
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,900
This is the first level.

428
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,880
How many different area zones are there?

429
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,560
How many are there?

430
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,840
No, no.

431
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,280
No, no, no.

432
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,800
No, no.

433
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,880
No, no.

434
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,580
No.

435
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,550
Okay.

436
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,710
Come on.

437
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:14,830
Come on.

438
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,030
Come on.

439
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,010
99?

440
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:24,710
Shut up.

441
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,290
Seriously?

442
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,730
Well, I wonder what a speedrun of this game looks like.

443
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,990
Okay.

444
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,070
No, no.

445
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,450
I lost my ball.

446
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,870
I

447
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,440
like how he cried.

448
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,020
We were so close.

449
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,840
That part's so tricky.

450
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,270
We were so close.

451
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,250
We were so close.

452
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,460
Can I hop over this?

453
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,560
Actually, how do I get through?

454
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,540
Does it open up?

455
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,680
I wish I could also roll to the bottom.

456
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,650
We can't cheat it.

457
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,510
Says you.

458
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,720
Okay, thank you for the ball cam.

459
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,780
Thank you, I hear it.

460
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,580
Oh yeah, it's very crunchy rolling down there.

461
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,380
Oh yeah, it's very crunchy.

462
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,640
Alright, we got there.

463
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,400
Yeah, ball cam.

464
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,680
Okay.

465
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,360
Alright, we're back.

466
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,800
I had a little bit of a respite.

467
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,780
It was pretty nice actually, I'm not gonna lie.

468
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:32,680
Just being able to walk normally with nothing to worry about or anything.

469
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,280
What's the quote about the Sisyphus that must imagine him happy?

470
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,500
What's the full quote?

471
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,690
Is it because you just can't, you'll be too sad if you think about his eternal pain?

472
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,150
Oh, it's an entire essay.

473
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,460
He might be.

474
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,280
He might be happy, who knows.

475
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,200
I think I got pretty far though.

476
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,920
I think I almost beat the game with that one, not gonna lie.

477
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,220
Now, what if I don't make it through the next one?

478
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,860
Rather, what if I mess up and then it goes all the way back to the beginning?

479
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,740
One must imagine Sisyphus freaking out.

480
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:34,820
True.

481
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,160
What the?

482
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,920
I can't see in front of me, it's a little difficult.

483
00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:02,520
If life is a repetitive grind with no real end or objective, and Sisyphus can't be happy with his repeated unending task, what hope do we have?

484
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,120
Murphy getting real.

485
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,220
I'm dead, so good luck everybody else.

486
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,980
Stop, I read Murphy's, I know it's not his birthday.

487
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,340
You can't fool me.

488
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,700
Oh my gosh, I did not see that.

489
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,240
I did not see that at all.

490
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,880
Oh, I wish they could have made this dang boulder a little smaller.

491
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,720
Just make it really dense.

492
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,240
Just make it a really dense boulder, you know?

493
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,820
But like small so I can see over it.

494
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,100
I'm slowly navigating.

495
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,600
Oh my god, I did not mean to jump.

496
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,440
My thumb got a little too relaxed there.

497
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,560
It's a beach ball.

498
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,860
It looks like the moon.

499
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,320
Like it's very smooth.

500
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,600
Looks like your brain.

501
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:33,460
Oh my gosh, we could get a mod, oh my goodness, where it's a wisp, you know?

502
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,990
That'd be...

503
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,490
Okay,

504
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,250
we made it, we're fine.

505
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:03,630
We have ultimate controls over this thing, kind of.

506
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,930
Okay, alright.

507
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,170
Oh gosh, alright.

508
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,810
We're coming back to where I originally... Oh no!

509
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,770
Easy.

510
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,130
Easy.

511
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,870
Easy.

512
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,170
Slow and steady.

513
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,010
Easy.

514
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,290
Easy.

515
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,090
Easy.

516
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,790
Oh my gosh.

517
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:37,930
Okay.

518
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,070
Wait, wait, wait.

519
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,510
No!

520
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,450
No!

521
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,070
No!

522
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Oh come on!

523
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
You almost stopped!

524
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,020
Please!

525
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,580
Parkour.

526
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,540
Parkour.

527
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,940
What do you mean something goofy?

528
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,000
What's happening?

529
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,580
What did you say?

530
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,640
Oh, would you say something goofy for that much money?

531
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,700
I say goofy things for free!

532
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,260
What?

533
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,160
Okay,

534
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,650
here we go.

535
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,730
Now we get to do it all over again!

536
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,850
I am calm.

537
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,050
I'm good.

538
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,290
What was Henya's time?

539
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,130
Does anybody know?

540
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,710
If anybody wants to look it up?

541
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,170
I'm curious to know as well.

542
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,910
What her time was?

543
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,430
Oh, maybe being at a diagonal is not the strat.

544
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,590
I just wanted to see what was in front of me.

545
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,340
Diagnovable.

546
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,440
Seven hours.

547
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,820
Fake fan.

548
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,860
It's the hard thing about being a VTuber too, is I don't get to watch streams as much.

549
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,760
But you know.

550
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,720
Also, I venture to Twitch like once a week.

551
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,860
So...

552
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,560
If she ever decides to cross stream, then...

553
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,300
Also, we stream at quite similar times.

554
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,540
She sometimes is a little later than me, but sometimes I get to catch like...

555
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,120
If I'm not streaming on a day, then I can usually be able to watch at least a little bit.

556
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,780
Just imagine how hard this game would go in first person mode.

557
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,280
Twitch is rough for non-subscribed channels.

558
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,100
Oh my god!

559
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,740
It's actually the worst.

560
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,160
I got a five minute ad once watching her.

561
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,580
This was the other day, so it's like fresh in my mind.

562
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,120
I got a five minute ad.

563
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,860
And then, not even 20 minutes into her stream, I got another five minute ad.

564
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,320
And I was like...

565
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,340
I can't...

566
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,400
I was like, I only watched 20 minutes.

567
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,260
What do you mean that I am already getting another ad so long?

568
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,820
And I would subscribe.

569
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,580
You know, maybe I should just subscribe to her.

570
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,800
I don't watch because, like I said, I don't go on Twitch very much.

571
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,400
But I enjoy her enough that I don't mind throwing money at her all the time.

572
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,480
But oh my gosh, it's just horrible.

573
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,660
That's why you won't find me on Twitch.

574
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,520
As much as some people are like, I don't like YouTube's chat.

575
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,160
And I do think that YouTube's chat is not great.

576
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,400
And then there's like some...

577
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,600
What's it called?

578
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,820
We miss out on like fun integration stuff, which makes me sad.

579
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:48,900
But...

580
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,460
I just hate Twitch so much.

581
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,540
And it sucks because like my friends are on Twitch and I sometimes go to watch them.

582
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,980
Oh my god!

583
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,580
No, no, no, no, no!

584
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,040
Wait, oh my gosh.

585
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,200
Oh, I thought I was going to stop.

586
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,120
There she goes.

587
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,100
Blame Twitch for this.

588
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,140
Yeah, Twitch threw off my groove.

589
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,710
I just wish YouTube would like...

590
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,610
Give a damn.

591
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:42,550
And like try to improve the YouTube streaming.

592
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,310
But now especially I think since a bunch of the bigger streamers are going back to Twitch.

593
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:52,090
Because YouTube had literally everything in the palm of their hands.

594
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,090
And then totally blew it.

595
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,830
I don't think they'll care at all.

596
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,810
It's so sad.

597
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,030
You dropped your giant ball.

598
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,070
I don't have multiple balls, not balls.

599
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,370
Only one.

600
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,870
I fumbled it so hard.

601
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,210
I know, it's so frustrating.

602
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,430
I still like watching on YouTube better overall, so I'm glad you're here.

603
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,470
I do too.

604
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,670
I forgot to get a drink.

605
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,290
Oh no.

606
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,700
But at least there's the cross streaming.

607
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,940
I just hope...

608
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,520
I just wish maybe more people did it.

609
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,380
But I get it too, because it's like, you know.

610
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,400
Then you're splitting audience.

611
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,540
I don't know.

612
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,800
I don't know.

613
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,320
Whatever.

614
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,020
I was watching stream and I had a tooth fall out.

615
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,460
What?

616
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,440
Kinky?

617
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,100
It was fun to raid Matara.

618
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,700
Yeah, I never get to do that.

619
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,660
So that was fun.

620
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,320
I still don't always remember the raiding as a feature.

621
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,780
Like at the end of the stream.

622
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,380
I'll get raids throughout stream and I'll be like, oh, I should raid somebody.

623
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,300
But also, like, I don't know so many people on YouTube.

624
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,520
And then sometimes, you know, if somebody doesn't have their raids turned on, you know, I can't do that obviously.

625
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:38,640
Wait.

626
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,410
It took seven hours.

627
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,150
Jeez.

628
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,270
I like, I don't...

629
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,730
I don't really enjoy rage games.

630
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,770
Like I enjoy challenges in a game, but yes, usually if it's like...

631
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,770
You know, a notoriously difficult game.

632
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,450
But I don't enjoy necessarily...

633
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:28,630
Like, oh, this game was built to be challenging, but not in a way that's like...

634
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,290
You know, it's like...

635
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,850
Like, I don't know.

636
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,390
I don't feel like I'm developing any skills.

637
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,490
From playing this.

638
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,570
Does that make sense?

639
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,790
Twitch is so awful, its entire staff is...

640
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:56,390
Oh my gosh.

641
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,170
Why don't you and other Vtubers have the DBR on?

642
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,010
That's because...

643
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,630
Usually, I'll get, like, people who are behind.

644
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,910
There's a couple of reasons.

645
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,250
One is, like, people will come in and they'll be, like, behind the stream.

646
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,790
And then the chat will be also...

647
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,690
Like, they'll be chatting.

648
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,410
But they'll be chatting about something from, like, ten minutes ago, you know?

649
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,630
So that's one reason I...

650
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,390
Keep it off.

651
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,850
Hold on, hold on, I really need to concentrate.

652
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:34,910
Hold on, sorry.

653
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:34,990
Sorry.

654
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,630
No, no, no, no.

655
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,690
Okay, we're fine.

656
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,550
We're fine.

657
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,070
We're fine.

658
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:46,750
We're fine.

659
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:47,450
We're fine.

660
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,290
We're fine.

661
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,010
We're fine.

662
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,590
Oh gosh, I'm all the way over here though.

663
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,010
Hold on.

664
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:52,630
Oh gosh.

665
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:53,590
Okay, hold on.

666
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:54,930
Wait, stop.

667
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:55,550
Stop.

668
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:56,050
Stop.

669
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:56,530
Stop.

670
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,090
Okay.

671
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,490
But another reason is...

672
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,090
In case something messes up...

673
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,290
Or something accidentally shows...

674
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,910
People can't, like, go back and...

675
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:16,830
Screenshot it.

676
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,470
It's so far over!

677
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,200
It's all the way over there.

678
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,380
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

679
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,000
Slowly, slowly.

680
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,340
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

681
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,720
Slowly.

682
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,600
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

683
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,800
Slowly, slowly.

684
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,060
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

685
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,300
Slowly.

686
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,480
Slowly.

687
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,620
Oh my gosh, this part's gonna be freaking impossible.

688
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,380
Oh my gosh.

689
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,480
This part's gonna be so difficult.

690
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,720
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

691
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,360
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

692
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,100
Slowly, slowly, slowly...

693
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,340
No, no, no, no, no, please!

694
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,880
I'm cool, I'm calm.

695
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,610
Why are you going over there?

696
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,090
You're trying to sabotage me.

697
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,590
How many areas did you say?

698
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,670
There's not 99.

699
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,910
That's impossible.

700
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,810
I'm googling it.

701
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,310
How... Game of Sisyphus.

702
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:51,730
How many areas in Game of Sisyphus?

703
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,980
There's 29!

704
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,240
You liars!

705
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,080
There's 29!

706
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,420
Oh no.

707
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,440
How is anyone supposed to do these?

708
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,300
Excuse me?

709
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,780
99, my ass.

710
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,960
This is what happened before!

711
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,700
Oh, I just need to hold...

712
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,740
Okay, I think I just need to hold...

713
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,220
I needed to hold...

714
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,300
I needed to hold right...

715
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:37,970
Back in the center.

716
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,690
60 FPS max.

717
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,510
Yeah, why would I need it to be any more?

718
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,950
YouTube doesn't even show...

719
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,450
I'm streaming in 1080p.

720
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,690
Why would I push my computer anymore?

721
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,530
Yeah, it's quaking in our boots right now.

722
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,070
Why?

723
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:00,970
Because I'm so good?

724
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,590
Because I'm so good at this?

725
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:08,450
It's been an hour and I'm only on level 1?

726
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,170
Yeah.

727
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:17,810
Yeah.

728
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:19,470
Yeah.

729
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,090
Yeah.

730
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,630
I'm a god gamer?

731
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,210
I saw some people say F.A.N.A.

732
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,850
only took one hour, so...

733
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,890
I'm not the goddess gamer.

734
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,270
Why is chat so obsessed with FPS?

735
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:46,210
Because high number is exciting.

736
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,990
High number means better.

737
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:50,610
Always.

738
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,370
Always.

739
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:54,490
Yes.

740
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,970
One hour without the ball?

741
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,190
Wait, what do you mean by that?

742
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,110
What do you mean by that?

743
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,360
Freaks per second.

744
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,900
That's why chat is obsessed.

745
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,740
Oh my gosh, 60 freaks per second is...

746
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,640
Actually...

747
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,900
You might need to go see a doctor.

748
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,260
Oh my gosh.

749
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,220
Leave the rock behind, do it kidding style.

750
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,280
What do you mean?

751
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,620
I wanted to send...

752
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,660
What I wanted to send was too long, so you can have my first August number because you're a little freaky.

753
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,340
No!

754
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,360
Wait, what do you want me to say?

755
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,080
Mike Tyson!

756
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,240
Thank you!

757
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,400
Can I push it up?

758
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,520
Over this?

759
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:25,840
No.

760
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,760
Dang it.

761
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,540
Thank you for the first number.

762
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,440
No way.

763
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,340
Thank you!

764
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,780
I'm honored.

765
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,960
Oh my goodness.

766
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,780
I almost lost that actually.

767
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:50,900
Okay.

768
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,240
Happy birthday legend.

769
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,200
What did you want me to say?

770
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,280
She ran to the top without the rock.

771
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,200
But how?

772
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,240
How did she get over the fence?

773
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,260
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

774
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,680
We're good.

775
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:15,740
We're good.

776
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,960
We're good.

777
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,060
We're chill.

778
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,120
Gamer.

779
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,240
See, that's what I'm saying.

780
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,560
She's the ultimate gamer.

781
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,460
Oh my goodness.

782
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,240
This part is scary because I'm not...

783
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,500
Clear!

784
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,600
Clear!

785
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,020
Do I just go in?

786
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,280
Clear!

787
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,620
I just lost it.

788
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,060
The game is kind.

789
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,840
How the heck?

790
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,100
And there's like... Hold on, can I leave you here?

791
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,760
You stay.

792
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,430
What are these?

793
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,150
This is... The game is not kind.

794
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:52,770
The game is not kind.

795
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,970
Excuse me?

796
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,360
It looks like the music makes it sound so lonely.

797
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,000
This game is evil!

798
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,380
This area is huge.

799
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:16,860
What?

800
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,540
We're scoping out the area first, guys.

801
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,440
What the heck is this?

802
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,700
This is so evil.

803
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,480
Here.

804
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,020
How do you even get past the fence?

805
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,700
Go out of bounds.

806
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,620
Go out of bounds.

807
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,600
Go out of bounds.

808
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,320
Go out of bounds.

809
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,340
Go out of bounds.

810
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,320
Go out of bounds.

811
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,160
Go out of bounds.

812
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,240
Go out of bounds.

813
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,580
Let's go get my ball.

814
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,480
Can this hit me?

815
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,440
I'm faster.

816
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,660
Can this hit me?

817
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,620
Oh my gosh!

818
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,440
Can this hit me?

819
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,860
Oh, come on.

820
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,760
I can.

821
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,780
Too short as usual.

822
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,060
Wait a second.

823
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:38,960
Go out of bounds.

824
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:39,940
Go out of bounds.

825
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,980
Go out of bounds.

826
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,440
Go out of bounds.

827
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,180
Go out of bounds.

828
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,920
It's just a fence.

829
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,560
It's just a wooden fence.

830
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:48,620
It's just a fence.

831
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,240
Break the game.

832
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,060
Break the game.

833
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,140
Break the game.

834
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,560
There is no escape.

835
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,780
This one seems longer than the previous one we just did, I'm gonna say.

836
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,080
I'm gonna say this one seems longer.

837
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,580
What's underneath anyway?

838
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:23,770
I'm scared.

839
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,390
I'm truly frightened, actually.

840
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:50,010
Is it actually a birthday?

841
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:53,530
Is it actually a birthday?

842
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,610
I've been having a rough day, so I'm glad you're streaming.

843
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,510
No, Cyber!

844
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,410
Let me have a better day!

845
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,360
Happy birthday to you.

846
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,560
Happy birthday to you.

847
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:16,380
Happy birthday, dear Nicholas.

848
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,240
Happy birthday to you.

849
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,140
Happy birthday!

850
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,340
Alright, we'll make it through.

851
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,460
Make

852
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:39,560
it through.

853
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,620
We gotta get to the other side though, I think.

854
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,800
Alright, look at that sweet, sweet diagonal action.

855
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,820
Did you guys see that?

856
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,200
Okay.

857
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,240
Oh, did you guys see that?

858
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,080
That sweet, sweet... that was clean.

859
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,220
That was clean, wasn't it?

860
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,620
Stop, Cyber!

861
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,500
Cyberfishing did not say it's a birthday.

862
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,040
Wait, thanks for the birthday wishes.

863
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,040
Wait, is it your birthday?

864
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,540
Did I not read it?

865
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,080
Sixty FPS diagonal.

866
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,620
No!

867
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,280
Stop, you guys!

868
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,000
Jeez!

869
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,680
Cheese.

870
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,140
Cheddar.

871
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,660
We're okay.

872
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,680
We're okay.

873
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,820
Alright.

874
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:52,960
Alright.

875
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,120
How do we make it through this one?

876
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,320
I

877
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,610
think I...

878
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,370
Maybe I can go through the middle.

879
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,310
Carefully.

880
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:17,490
Yes.

881
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,050
Let the obstacle help.

882
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:22,590
Middle.

883
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:24,470
Cinto.

884
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,110
Mia.

885
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:26,230
Mia.

886
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,110
I feel like I haven't seen you in a minute.

887
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,490
I hope you're good.

888
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,110
If you've been around...

889
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,830
Sorry, I'm bad at looking at names in chat sometimes.

890
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,350
Pause near the plunger.

891
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:45,670
Okay.

892
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:47,770
Okay.

893
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,350
Stefo, thanks for nine months!

894
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:54,070
Okay.

895
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,470
Minky, please.

896
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,870
That's because I'm reading your actual messages!

897
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,030
I've been getting an education.

898
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:09,890
What have you... Teach... Tell the class what you've learned.

899
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,590
Tell us one thing you've learned.

900
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,430
Pretend you're giving a presentation.

901
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:25,550
Oh my goodness.

902
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:26,830
Oh my goodness.

903
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:27,730
We saved that.

904
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,290
Good job, guys.

905
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,050
I wish I could see it when it's long.

906
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,250
Like when it's pushed out, you know?

907
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,830
It should have a little something on it.

908
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:47,150
I don't know.

909
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:48,050
Like a little flag.

910
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:49,730
Ball is life.

911
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:50,850
Eternal life.

912
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,650
We love the orb.

913
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:53,690
Our little ball.

914
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:54,310
Look at him.

915
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,570
We're using that as a support.

916
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,310
Oh yeah.

917
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:02,350
Oh yeah.

918
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:03,550
Oh yeah.

919
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,490
This is a great thumbnail.

920
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,870
I kind of want the ball, but with my face on it.

921
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:10,050
Good luck.

922
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,830
Thank you!

923
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,710
Okay.

924
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:14,250
Let's go.

925
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,730
It pushes...

926
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,520
a little fast.

927
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,040
Go!

928
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,020
Got it!

929
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,820
Diagonal slide.

930
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,820
Diagonal slide.

931
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,860
There we go.

932
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,080
I think I can make it on the right, right?

933
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,540
Against the wall?

934
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,820
Can I make it against the wall?

935
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,280
I think so.

936
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:25,970
Yeah!

937
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:28,570
Nice.

938
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:33,490
Oh gosh.

939
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:33,790
Oh gosh.

940
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:34,030
Oh gosh.

941
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,530
Okay.

942
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,130
We're good.

943
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:37,130
Alright.

944
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:38,750
Onwards!

945
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,230
Onwards!

946
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,710
Onwards!

947
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,090
Okay.

948
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,770
Nice!

949
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:54,590
Okay.

950
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,210
We can make it past these guys.

951
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,310
Okay.

952
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,390
Nice and easy.

953
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,450
Nice and easy.

954
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,230
Slow and steady.

955
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

956
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,850
Get it twisted.

957
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,450
Why are you telling me?

958
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:15,350
What am I getting twisted?

959
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,570
Don't get it twisted.

960
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,470
This is a little obstacle.

961
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:22,710
Right here.

962
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:23,170
Okay.

963
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,190
We overcame.

964
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,150
We overcame.

965
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,790
We are truly the overcomers.

966
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:31,890
Okay.

967
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,150
Here.

968
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:38,690
I wish I could put my ball somewhere.

969
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,270
Wish I could just plop it down.

970
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,370
It's from a Northern Lion stream.

971
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:50,670
Who is that guy?

972
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:51,650
Wait.

973
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,070
Who is that guy?

974
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,190
I feel like I'm learning about Jerma all over again.

975
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:02,150
Which I still don't even really know who that guy is.

976
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:04,110
So...

977
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,410
Yeah, I know it's fun as Oshie.

978
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,210
I just don't know anything about him.

979
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:11,470
Oh, Nimi likes him too.

980
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,750
He is bald Jerma.

981
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,690
It's just like Jerma.

982
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,450
So you're saying Jerma is not original.

983
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,230
You're saying Jerma is...

984
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:26,850
You know, the way everybody talked about him, he just seemed like the...

985
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,190
Like the end-all be-all streamer.

986
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,590
And that he was the most original man in the world.

987
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:33,970
But you're saying that he's not.

988
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,250
Oh, of America.

989
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:40,850
And then Jerma...

990
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,410
Then Northern Lion is the Canadian.

991
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,010
Vinny, Jerma, Northern Lion, Holy Trinity.

992
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,110
I only really know Vinny, but I mean...

993
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:58,090
I watched his, like, game glitch stuff.

994
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,610
I don't really watch his streams.

995
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:03,630
Don't tell Matara, I guess.

996
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:07,730
Since I know Matara is friends with him.

997
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:09,850
Jerma equals Minto.

998
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,210
Northern Lion...

999
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:11,490
Lion.

1000
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:23,570
It almost, like, sucked in my throat there.

1001
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,370
Northern... It's a hard name to say.

1002
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:32,570
Northern Lion.

1003
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:33,950
Okay.

1004
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:35,670
Guys, I have to focus!

1005
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:40,350
We're about to come up upon a tricky situation.

1006
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,770
First, I need to...

1007
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,860
First, I need to get over.

1008
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,000
Okay.

1009
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,040
It's quite slow, but I'm still nervous.

1010
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:13,890
I'm scared.

1011
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:14,210
I'm scared.

1012
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,950
We've gotten so far through here.

1013
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:30,190
Let's see the end!

1014
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:57,980
Rude!

1015
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,880
Yay!

1016
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,520
Okay.

1017
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,220
Alright.

1018
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,380
I need to get a little closer, I think.

1019
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,500
Oh gosh!

1020
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,200
Oh gosh!

1021
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,520
You guys all saw I almost one-shot this entire level.

1022
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,760
You guys all saw that, right?

1023
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,960
I almost did this level!

1024
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,340
First try!

1025
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,360
I almost did it!

1026
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,160
First try!

1027
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,160
No!

1028
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,340
I don't know the timing on that.

1029
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,460
Hold on.

1030
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,100
Hold on.

1031
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:44,920
Let's see.

1032
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,780
Why couldn't it get stopped by...

1033
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:50,100
Why didn't it shoot up straight into the air like past this part?

1034
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,860
Where it would've stopped.

1035
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,860
Oh, there's two of them even.

1036
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,960
Three of them even!

1037
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,700
You guys, I have to get the timing perfectly three times!

1038
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:06,450
They all have the same timing though.

1039
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:14,630
What is this

1040
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:23,390
one anyway?

1041
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,290
Just rock?

1042
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:27,870
What are the red ones?

1043
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:31,030
Okay, anyway.

1044
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:36,590
Oh, they're explosives.

1045
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:40,390
I love that!

1046
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,560
Be free!

1047
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:47,900
This is the first!

1048
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,040
Grab on to the tree!

1049
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,800
Grab on and pull!

1050
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,730
You've got this!

1051
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:03,110
Return to Minky.

1052
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:05,290
He's already halfway there.

1053
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,930
He's only got pants on.

1054
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:15,640
You...

1055
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:20,240
I'm so stinkin' stinky.

1056
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,760
I'm not stinky.

1057
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:22,640
I'm just, you know.

1058
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,740
You know what I mean.

1059
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,040
You know what I mean.

1060
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,850
Game is stinky.

1061
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,050
Okay.

1062
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,850
We did it once, we can do it again.

1063
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:46,610
I just hate how slow it is, you know?

1064
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,490
Speedrunners must hate this game.

1065
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,950
Don't say that you want to sniff me, please.

1066
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:55,890
Don't say that.

1067
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:07,770
We're good.

1068
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:08,450
We're good.

1069
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,670
Everything's fine.

1070
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:11,910
Oh, here's the one in the middle.

1071
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:19,810
You know, being a Vtuber is such an interesting thing.

1072
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,550
I see...

1073
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:27,630
I see so many strange comments about me on the daily.

1074
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,450
And I just have to be like...

1075
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:32,650
Yeah.

1076
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,490
Like, oh, you guys are so silly.

1077
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,930
I see so many strange comments, though.

1078
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:46,890
I'm just like, wow.

1079
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:49,330
I think if...

1080
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:52,090
If this was normal people... Oh my goodness.

1081
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:52,610
No, no, no.

1082
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,670
They would probably lose their... They would go bonkers.

1083
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:56,850
They would go bonkers.

1084
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:03,210
They would be like, what's wrong with this world?

1085
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:09,930
I think most people would lose faith in humanity if they saw the things.

1086
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,470
How many of those are from Orca?

1087
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,530
It's a variety of people.

1088
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,050
I see it all on Twitter.

1089
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:23,690
People would be like, I lose all humanity in this world.

1090
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,600
Probably.

1091
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,740
Okay, nice.

1092
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,760
Go past.

1093
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,440
Okay, should we tone it down?

1094
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,760
I'm not saying that.

1095
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:54,960
I think it's funny.

1096
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,520
I think it's funny.

1097
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,520
I'm just saying if like an average Joe were to...

1098
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,300
You know, one day be like, I'm gonna become a Vtuber.

1099
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,200
Maybe it's also my fault because I've...

1100
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,920
I've been like, yeah, freaks.

1101
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,660
Rise up.

1102
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,780
I'm like Megatron.

1103
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,800
I think that's just streamers in general.

1104
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,840
I'm sure Flesh streamers also have weird comments about them.

1105
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:26,120
True, but I think also I've encouraged it.

1106
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,380
Freak up.

1107
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,200
Yeah, pretty much.

1108
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,460
I just say, I just, you know, thought about it the other day.

1109
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,700
And I was just like, wow.

1110
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,280
Wow.

1111
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,100
I'm glad my mom doesn't have Twitter.

1112
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,480
Or know about my account.

1113
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,380
Kind of deal, you know.

1114
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,300
Just like that.

1115
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:54,380
Yeah.

1116
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,100
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1117
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:03,960
Come on.

1118
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,060
Come on, buddy.

1119
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,240
And just like that, we're back where we were.

1120
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,200
Maybe the level wasn't much longer than I thought it was.

1121
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,020
Chat reflects the streamer.

1122
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:19,620
Oh no.

1123
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,300
Okay.

1124
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,320
No, I think I'm gonna lose it again.

1125
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,120
One down.

1126
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,620
Two to go.

1127
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,080
Okay, one down.

1128
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:59,800
Not that I get close enough to where they don't touch it, obviously.

1129
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,660
But I can like, get through, you know.

1130
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,060
Go, go, go.

1131
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,240
Okay.

1132
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,820
Another one down.

1133
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,220
Nice.

1134
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:23,550
Okay.

1135
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:25,530
Okay.

1136
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:32,290
Wait, wait.

1137
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:33,430
I'm not ready.

1138
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:35,930
Go!

1139
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:37,570
Go!

1140
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:38,350
Sensei, let's go!

1141
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:46,410
Eerie!

1142
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:05,670
Let's go scope it out.

1143
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,530
If I touch it myself...

1144
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,350
Wait a second.

1145
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:28,360
Wait.

1146
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,060
Oh.

1147
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,060
Okay, game.

1148
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:35,160
Game.

1149
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,340
They respawned.

1150
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,740
They respawned it?

1151
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,100
What the hell is this?

1152
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:51,280
Wait, this could be... I feel like a lot of speedrunners could use this.

1153
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,060
And now you knock the ball way in the front.

1154
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,080
What's this next one?

1155
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,080
Oh my god!

1156
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,360
Oh my god!

1157
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:05,540
Oh my god!

1158
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,760
Don't like that.

1159
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,620
I don't like that.

1160
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,500
Okay.

1161
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,660
This one is... Oh, whoops.

1162
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,960
It's just another slow and steady kind of dealio, I think.

1163
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,080
I think we'll mostly be alright.

1164
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,520
I'm concerned a little bit about the textured road, but...

1165
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,100
It could just also be a texture, right?

1166
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,240
Ever onward, ever higher, ever better!

1167
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:59,510
Hello rock.

1168
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:01,230
Did you miss me?

1169
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:02,830
Did you miss me?

1170
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,650
It's not a bowler.

1171
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,550
It's a rock!

1172
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,410
A rock!

1173
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,410
Okay.

1174
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,680
Really crunchy.

1175
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,080
Okay.

1176
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:30,580
Like...

1177
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,440
Crunchy!

1178
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:38,900
Oh my goodness.

1179
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,620
Like, super...

1180
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,320
This game is actually pretty ASMR.

1181
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,380
Rage game ASMR, yeah!

1182
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:47,860
Right?

1183
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,860
Like, it's actually quite nice.

1184
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,380
I'm gonna try and...

1185
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,700
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1186
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,680
Okay, we're good.

1187
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,980
Yeah, I really like the soundtrack in this one.

1188
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:17,440
I prefer it much more to the...

1189
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,960
Oh my gosh, the talking and...

1190
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,380
And what's it called?

1191
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,640
Is that where I can break out of bounds?

1192
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,320
We found the secret!

1193
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:30,940
To the talking and getting over it or whatever.

1194
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:33,880
Turn off the music?

1195
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,740
No, I like it!

1196
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,580
I'm just talking about how I like it!

1197
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:49,960
Okay.

1198
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,160
Oh, you can push your thing faster.

1199
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,020
Oh my god, guys.

1200
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,100
I think I'm... I think I've been playing hard mode.

1201
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,460
I haven't been pushing my boulder fast at all.

1202
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:05,940
Here

1203
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:15,770
we go.

1204
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:17,750
Oh, geez.

1205
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,130
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1206
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,990
No, no, no!

1207
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:24,330
You're gonna explode!

1208
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,450
I went

1209
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,220
out of bounds three times.

1210
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,870
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

1211
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:53,070
Oh, thank goodness the catchers exist, right?

1212
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:56,730
Okay,

1213
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,360
back to the crunch.

1214
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,570
Yeah, and see, now I'm pushing it faster.

1215
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:16,330
I don't know why I didn't think... Oh, I'm just gonna... I should shift.

1216
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:19,310
I should press run and push at the same time.

1217
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,970
Instead I've been doing it the super slowliest ever!

1218
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:32,070
Perfect VTuber idol is so pure and innocent would never look up anime girl skirts or have a body pillow of a middle-aged man with eyepatch.

1219
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:36,370
I'm... I'm... I'm no idol!

1220
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,610
I couldn't... Oh no, I messed up again.

1221
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:50,150
Catchers!

1222
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:50,690
Catchers!

1223
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,310
Catchers!

1224
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:52,790
No, catchers!

1225
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:53,550
Catchers!

1226
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:54,410
Catchers, please!

1227
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:55,530
Catchers, do your job!

1228
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:56,190
Catchers!

1229
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:00,830
Stop there!

1230
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:01,350
Stop!

1231
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:01,890
Stop!

1232
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:02,470
Stop!

1233
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,890
Stop!

1234
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:03,290
Stop!

1235
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:03,670
Stop!

1236
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,600
We're fine!

1237
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,020
Everything is okay!

1238
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,680
The catchers!

1239
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,000
I literally was just praising you!

1240
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,340
That could be worse.

1241
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,500
I just have to remember how to get through this again.

1242
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,280
I have to get through two of them and not mess up.

1243
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:55,450
Push!

1244
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:10,330
I'm starting to lose control over my bodily functions.

1245
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:13,570
Everything is f'ed.

1246
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,010
Everything sucks.

1247
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:15,710
Trill.

1248
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,190
Trill, trill, trill.

1249
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,070
No, we're happy doing this.

1250
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:23,410
Remember?

1251
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:24,630
Imagine him happy.

1252
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:26,470
He's chilling.

1253
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:28,430
He loves doing this.

1254
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:31,990
Wouldn't you?

1255
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,110
Hold

1256
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:41,690
on.

1257
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:42,690
Hold on.

1258
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:43,510
I'm trying to get it.

1259
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:44,450
There we go.

1260
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:48,810
Okay, we made it.

1261
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:55,930
I'm actually starting to forget controls.

1262
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:56,850
This is so bad.

1263
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,150
Can we sing break stuff?

1264
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:10,430
I'm forgetting to move my mouse and also to press left or press right or press WASDA.

1265
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,750
It's not everything.

1266
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:13,930
Why am I losing all controls?

1267
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:20,150
It's like my brain has actually become mush.

1268
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,510
The minky madness.

1269
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:28,950
After a few rounds, can we sing break stuff to get the happy energy out?

1270
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:32,570
I can't.

1271
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:41,250
I have to prepare my voice for Friday Jazzy Jazz Jazzathon Jazz Jazzness.

1272
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:47,070
Which I made a set list for yesterday?

1273
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:47,950
Was it yesterday?

1274
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:49,690
ViviCorinthanksforthegifted!

1275
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:56,770
And I have quite a few songs to learn which is why I'm taking off tomorrow so I can learn them.

1276
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,030
My brain is smooth.

1277
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:03,630
No, it needs to be like this road.

1278
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,810
It needs to be like this road.

1279
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:10,170
I leave Minto at the foot of the mountain.

1280
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,910
Hold on, I can't read all of this!

1281
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:17,510
She too concludes that all there is is hot dog.

1282
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:21,670
Wait, that all is hot dog?

1283
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:23,650
Hot dog.

1284
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:25,890
Hot dog.

1285
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,950
I have...

1286
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:32,670
Brianthanksforthefivegifted!

1287
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,650
I have a karaoke on...

1288
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:37,730
On...

1289
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:38,290
Friday.

1290
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:40,950
There might be an announcement.

1291
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:44,670
But...

1292
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:45,910
I have to confirm.

1293
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,390
Otherwise the announcement will be another day.

1294
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:59,240
But for those who watched me before I went to heaven...

1295
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,400
Sorry if it is karaoke and announcement.

1296
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,260
For those who don't know...

1297
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,880
That's how I...

1298
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,300
That's how I announced my graduation.

1299
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:19,660
Was karaoke plus announcement.

1300
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,220
But...

1301
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,800
Hold on, I need to stretch.

1302
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,310
The cafe henceforth without a manager seems to be...

1303
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:40,740
Her neither timely nor clean.

1304
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,480
Each subscriber of her channel, each comment...

1305
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,880
I couldn't read the rest, it went too fast.

1306
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:45,680
Thank you.

1307
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:47,720
Karaoke plus announcement, BTS.

1308
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,900
I know, I'm sorry!

1309
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,960
I just tuned in, you're graduating?

1310
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,400
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

1311
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,020
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

1312
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,880
You're not gonna do that again, right?

1313
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,880
No, no.

1314
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,100
What do you mean three out of two?

1315
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,580
Yeah, so...

1316
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,140
Yeah, but I don't know.

1317
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:15,900
It might be...

1318
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,440
Instead the announcement might be next week.

1319
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,600
Announcement, parenthesis, good.

1320
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,460
Announcement, parenthesis, good.

1321
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,180
Actually, hold on, let me check and see if they just messaged me about it.

1322
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,980
Oh, hello, Blue Archive.

1323
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:51,320
Nevermind.

1324
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,700
They haven't, they didn't.

1325
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,700
Announcement, cement.

1326
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,440
Announcement, good.

1327
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:03,460
Did someone say Blue Archive?

1328
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,660
Yeah, I was playing earlier.

1329
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:07,980
And I still had it open.

1330
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,520
I was checking on my phone.

1331
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,920
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, um, what's it called?

1332
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,320
I'm not, um...

1333
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:21,460
I'm not, uh, uh, uh, stalling or anything.

1334
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,400
Do you think I can go through the corner over there?

1335
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,880
No, I don't think I can.

1336
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,780
I showed up in YouTube AI told me Minna will graduate.

1337
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,460
Why would I announce my graduation on this stream?

1338
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,840
Why would I do that?

1339
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,220
Why would I be like, oh yeah, by the way guys, while I'm playing Sisyphus?

1340
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,720
What's it like?

1341
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,520
Extreme crash out, truly.

1342
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,000
Oh guys, I'm scared.

1343
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,420
I can't push it sideways.

1344
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,400
I think we just gotta go.

1345
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,420
I think we just gotta go for it.

1346
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,040
Oh, oh, no,

1347
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:15,170
no.

1348
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,190
Grubba, grubba, grubba.

1349
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:18,090
Grubba.

1350
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,750
Okay, slow and steady.

1351
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,670
Slow and steady.

1352
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,530
Yippee!

1353
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,590
I pushed it sideways!

1354
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:36,050
Alright.

1355
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:39,010
Alright, next one.

1356
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,710
Next one.

1357
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:46,010
Okay.

1358
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:53,310
I wish they made the other pathways, like, possibly doable, you know, but...

1359
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,220
Oh my gosh, this one little guy sticking out.

1360
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,160
What am I supposed to do about him?

1361
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,160
Right there.

1362
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:08,440
Because we would take up the role of Sisyphus if that happened.

1363
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,680
It'd be painfully poetic.

1364
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:10,440
Please don't.

1365
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,200
I can 100% guarantee you I am not graduating.

1366
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:27,440
Why?

1367
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:34,940
See, like, if I could sneak through there, it was just also a little difficult.

1368
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,700
Okay, still less frustrating than The Sims.

1369
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,340
At least I'm playing a game, right?

1370
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:47,620
Hey,

1371
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,080
Bellatro is a game.

1372
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,440
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1373
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,540
That's a sad story.

1374
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,960
Sisyphus if he was freaky.

1375
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:07,840
Wait, not Brock, sorry.

1376
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,620
Rock to push up that thing.

1377
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:11,460
No!

1378
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,820
I was playing Bellatro earlier today and I was on my run.

1379
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,200
And I went to go use...

1380
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,360
I was doing... I was on one of the...

1381
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,980
I was on the boss...

1382
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,360
I was on anti-11.

1383
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,640
And I was on the boss...

1384
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,040
No, sorry, I was on anti-10.

1385
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:36,540
And I was on the boss and the boss was you can only play one hand.

1386
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:46,060
And I had a tarot card that I was like, okay, I'm going to use it on my ace.

1387
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:50,200
And it will turn it into a multiplier.

1388
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:55,300
And I then will have a hand that will be able to get me through it.

1389
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,240
And...

1390
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:01,180
Like I was going to be able to get through the boss.

1391
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,700
But instead of pressing use on the...

1392
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,300
On the ace, I accidentally pressed play.

1393
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:12,280
And it only played the single ace.

1394
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,300
And since it was only...

1395
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:19,300
Since it was the boss where you only get one play...

1396
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:20,980
I... I...

1397
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:24,100
I was so... I was so mad!

1398
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,300
I was so mad at myself, I almost uninstalled the game.

1399
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:32,120
I was like, no!

1400
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:33,880
No!

1401
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,260
Oh my gosh, I was so upset.

1402
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,920
It's not that I got needled.

1403
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,440
It's that I... Well, I mean, I guess maybe.

1404
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,160
But I also just... It was my mess up.

1405
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,020
So that makes it even worse.

1406
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,420
It was my mess up.

1407
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:59,360
I just like instinctively pressed play instead of pressing use on the tarot card.

1408
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,860
I even, when it happened, I quickly closed out of my game.

1409
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:08,660
I was like, what if it didn't save?

1410
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:09,800
What if it didn't save?

1411
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,620
But unfortunately, it had.

1412
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,180
It had.

1413
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:26,030
Unplugs computer.

1414
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:27,490
Gets off of Wi-Fi.

1415
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:28,650
OK, I'm going to stop stalling.

1416
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:30,030
I'm just going to go for it.

1417
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:52,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1418
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,260
That was a close one.

1419
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,660
Close, close, close.

1420
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,300
Close, close, close.

1421
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,520
That is...

1422
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,420
The crowd goes wild.

1423
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,880
Holy moly.

1424
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,140
That one was so close, I feel.

1425
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,660
I was truly terrified for my afterlife there.

1426
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:36,720
My life in game.

1427
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:46,050
What?

1428
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:54,230
I'm scared here.

1429
01:33:55,150 --> 01:33:57,090
I'm scared I'm gonna...

1430
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:58,650
I'm scared I'm gonna...

1431
01:33:59,730 --> 01:33:59,990
OK.

1432
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:01,310
OK.

1433
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:02,770
Just a little bit more.

1434
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,230
Hot dog!

1435
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:06,210
Hot dog, she's coming!

1436
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:13,330
Concentrate!

1437
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:36,490
Got

1438
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:49,710
the next one.

1439
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:51,110
Oh no!

1440
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,860
Break it.

1441
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:09,040
Crush.

1442
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,480
And over.

1443
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,480
And send you into the ball pit.

1444
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,200
Alright, let's see what we got here.

1445
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:22,480
This game is the best representation of a wisp's dating life.

1446
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,500
What do you mean by that?

1447
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:29,100
Then once we get through here...

1448
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,760
I love the sad ball music.

1449
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:38,130
Lift.

1450
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:40,830
Oh, that's so anticlimactic.

1451
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:48,630
OK, this one doesn't seem as bad.

1452
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:52,890
Let's just send... unless you're like...

1453
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:55,630
That one only.

1454
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:59,610
OK, so if you go the wrong way, that's messed up.

1455
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:03,690
This is why we're scoping out the competition first.

1456
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:07,410
Three down, 26 to go.

1457
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:10,430
Water.

1458
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,630
Is it like extra slippery or something?

1459
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:24,450
This one seems really tough, I'm not gonna lie.

1460
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:27,870
A swoop.

1461
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:32,930
Does a literal Shrek come out and beat me to death?

1462
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:37,850
We all be fumbling.

1463
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:40,590
Those denying is a patriot spy.

1464
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,750
I believe in you guys.

1465
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:47,110
I believe in you guys.

1466
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:49,940
But if you, like, you know...

1467
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:56,010
If you get somebody else, just make sure that they let you watch Minto, OK?

1468
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,330
Just make sure that they're like...

1469
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:05,770
Oh yeah, that funny little green thing you watch.

1470
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:06,970
She's fun.

1471
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:10,350
You know?

1472
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:18,250
You have to make sure she also likes watching me.

1473
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:22,510
And if she's just like, stop watching, then break up.

1474
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:24,310
Break up.

1475
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:25,030
Break up.

1476
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:26,250
It's a red flag.

1477
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:26,930
Minto?

1478
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:27,910
Green flag.

1479
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:29,090
I'm green.

1480
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:31,510
Hello, funny green thing.

1481
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:33,350
I would like to purchase a rock fact.

1482
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,210
A rock fact.

1483
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,260
Sometimes the ball rolls and sometimes the ball falls.

1484
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:47,060
It's all part of life.

1485
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,180
That's a rock fact.

1486
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,020
Can't argue with that logic.

1487
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,400
But it also is just like...

1488
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,780
I mean, I think I would also be kind of jealous.

1489
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,660
I'm not gonna lie.

1490
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,520
But I also, you know...

1491
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,240
I watch Vtubers.

1492
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,560
I watch, you know...

1493
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,460
It sounds horrible.

1494
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:08,380
I hate this one.

1495
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:14,400
I'm also just kind of needy, so it's like, I'm different.

1496
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:18,820
Oh, shoot.

1497
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,320
Oh, shoot.

1498
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,240
Oh, shoot.

1499
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:20,920
Oh, shoot.

1500
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:21,680
Oh, shoot.

1501
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:22,100
Oh, shoot.

1502
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:22,800
Oh, shoot.

1503
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:23,760
Oh, shoot.

1504
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:27,700
No.

1505
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:27,980
No.

1506
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:28,440
No.

1507
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1508
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:29,800
No, no.

1509
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:30,320
No, no.

1510
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:42,460
Okay, what I meant to say... Okay, hold on.

1511
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,000
Let me explain my thoughts before I start going in.

1512
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,360
Okay.

1513
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:53,080
Say I was with someone and they watched Vtubers.

1514
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,820
No, I don't think I would be jealous.

1515
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:59,820
I think...

1516
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,400
I don't think so.

1517
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:05,700
It's hard to say.

1518
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,540
It's hard to say.

1519
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,900
But I think...

1520
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:15,300
Honestly, you should just...

1521
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,640
This is real talk, okay?

1522
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,560
This is real talk.

1523
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:22,620
You should be with someone that will let you enjoy your hobbies.

1524
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,520
No matter what it is.

1525
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,960
So, unless it's like, you know, murdering people.

1526
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:30,760
That's a weird hobby.

1527
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,760
Is Minto going to get emotional?

1528
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:42,020
No.

1529
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,520
I'm just saying...

1530
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:49,420
Liking Minto is a...

1531
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:51,620
Crucial, crucial, crucial...

1532
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,880
It's like the biggest...

1533
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,020
The biggest...

1534
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:55,400
The biggest...

1535
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,180
Wrong way.

1536
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,980
It's the biggest...

1537
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,520
Let me meet her first, okay?

1538
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:03,660
Or him.

1539
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:05,560
Let me meet them first.

1540
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:07,720
Let me meet the partner first.

1541
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,100
Let me meet them and I'll give my approval or not, okay?

1542
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:16,280
Minto graduates and we all watch...

1543
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,320
Miracle event.

1544
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:20,680
Hamburger.

1545
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:24,480
Are you our mom?

1546
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:25,400
No.

1547
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,280
But...

1548
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,160
What if they get jealous of my Oshis?

1549
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:34,220
We'll just...

1550
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:35,740
Don't let that happen.

1551
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:41,100
I think if you are, you know, good enough...

1552
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,600
If you're like, you know, attentive enough...

1553
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,040
They shouldn't get jealous, right?

1554
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:49,860
Okay, alright.

1555
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:49,940
Alright.

1556
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:55,240
This one has a factor that I did not take into consideration.

1557
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,300
Which increases the difficulty.

1558
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:02,660
The best kinds of relationships are the ones where you support each other in all areas of life.

1559
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,700
Including your hobbies.

1560
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:05,460
Exactly.

1561
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:10,620
By the way, Minto, I support your MGS brain rot.

1562
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:11,860
As you should.

1563
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,240
As you should.

1564
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:21,120
I don't... I would still have it even if you didn't support it.

1565
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,020
If you were just like...

1566
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:28,360
I can't keep watching you when you're...

1567
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,640
Wasting your afterlife away like this.

1568
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,620
With all this brain rot.

1569
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:34,600
And I would say...

1570
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:35,680
The door is right there.

1571
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,240
I would say...

1572
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:40,880
How am I supposed to stop that?

1573
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,480
When it was involuntary.

1574
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:46,360
I can't help what I feel.

1575
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:52,220
Call it a Metal Gear fetish if you will.

1576
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,680
I don't know.

1577
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,180
You know, it's just one of those things.

1578
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,220
It's just one of those things.

1579
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:12,120
Nice.

1580
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:13,980
Nice.

1581
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,060
Okay, hold on.

1582
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,300
We're gonna go through this one.

1583
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,200
We're gonna wait for it.

1584
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:27,760
We're gonna wait for it.

1585
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,180
Alright.

1586
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,840
Nice and fast over the wood.

1587
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:35,640
That's nice.

1588
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,480
How am I doing, you guys?

1589
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,780
Actually, am I doing well?

1590
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,360
Am I doing well?

1591
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:51,550
Good.

1592
01:42:52,890 --> 01:42:53,610
Rock fat.

1593
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:58,340
Okay, let's wait for this.

1594
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:05,260
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll.

1595
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:06,220
Okay.

1596
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:07,040
Nice.

1597
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:08,240
Nice suit.

1598
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,200
Nice suit.

1599
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:12,640
Okay.

1600
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,080
I did pretty good.

1601
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:16,880
Fine, I guess.

1602
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,960
Okay, macaroni.

1603
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,240
More like Tsundere-caroni.

1604
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:29,980
Alright,

1605
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:42,110
we're making it through.

1606
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:43,510
We're making it through.

1607
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,750
We're making it through.

1608
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,950
Put one foot in front of the other.

1609
01:43:56,750 --> 01:44:00,200
Put one foot in front of the other.

1610
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,020
Okay.

1611
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,320
Hold on, I'm gonna wait for this one.

1612
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:11,240
Okay.

1613
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:18,880
Watching both of your playthroughs of MGS series has pushed me to getting to my best friend slash bro into MGS.

1614
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:22,100
So far, it's been fun watching his reactions of confusion.

1615
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:24,680
Good!

1616
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:24,880
Good!

1617
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,020
Well, I'm assuming then that you've played it then, right?

1618
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,480
If you're making your friend play it.

1619
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,480
I'm assuming that means you've played it.

1620
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,900
I think this is okay.

1621
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,200
And then this one's gonna...

1622
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:50,200
wait.

1623
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:55,340
We're okay.

1624
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:56,140
We're okay.

1625
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:57,600
Wait, no, I have to go this way.

1626
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:58,180
That's right.

1627
01:44:58,180 --> 01:44:59,460
Remember we scoped out?

1628
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:00,400
We scoped.

1629
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:06,180
Oh my gosh, this next part is gonna be...

1630
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,880
Oh, they're all the quickies.

1631
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,640
Nice save, thank you.

1632
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:15,560
Okay, I can probably be a little... you know what, let's just go.

1633
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:25,620
Okay,

1634
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,500
alright, next one.

1635
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:32,800
Go!

1636
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,920
I might be able to do this one too, but I'm just... I'm not gonna risk it.

1637
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:40,440
There we go.

1638
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,860
Good thing I didn't risk it.

1639
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,180
Okay, go!

1640
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,700
Oh gosh, okay.

1641
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,920
Probably take it to the sides, I think.

1642
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,740
I have a first date this Sunday?

1643
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:03,080
With a really cute girl who also likes Vtubers.

1644
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,380
We immediately started asking about...

1645
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,060
I didn't get to finish reading it.

1646
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:10,360
What did you ask about?

1647
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,060
What did they ask about?

1648
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,040
Oh she's...

1649
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:15,360
Wait, wait, wait, don't reach out.

1650
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:17,800
Go,

1651
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:28,970
go, go!

1652
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:31,950
Oh my gosh.

1653
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:33,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1654
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,020
Almost first try.

1655
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:57,980
I know, right?

1656
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,880
Almost first try.

1657
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:07,040
How do I... get it?

1658
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:09,520
How do I move it?

1659
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:11,820
Wait, this is actually a problem.

1660
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:14,900
It's actually stuck.

1661
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:23,110
Oh there we go, I got it.

1662
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:29,110
I'm just gonna stand here?

1663
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:30,350
Alright, there we go.

1664
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:34,090
Alright, alright.

1665
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,790
Yeah, that could've been so much worse.

1666
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:41,110
Though I was literally at the very end and that just makes me...

1667
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,650
A little salty.

1668
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:50,090
But you know, I tried to go diagonal and then I lost it.

1669
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:53,350
Because going diagonal on a...

1670
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:56,830
Quickly is a little scary, you know?

1671
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,340
Like here.

1672
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:06,480
Like this is what I was trying to do.

1673
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,180
Oh my gosh, no, no, no, no.

1674
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:09,680
No, no, no.

1675
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:10,300
There we go.

1676
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:30,400
If only it was more around here that we got flung back to, but...

1677
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:30,920
That's okay.

1678
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:31,060
Okay.

1679
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:35,500
Actually, I don't think I can make it.

1680
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:36,300
I don't think so.

1681
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:36,800
Hold on.

1682
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,280
We're gonna wait, we're gonna wait.

1683
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,820
Alright, and next one.

1684
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:50,620
Alright.

1685
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,500
And there we go.

1686
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:57,160
There we go.

1687
01:48:58,840 --> 01:48:59,280
Okay.

1688
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:03,620
Push, push, push, push.

1689
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,680
Like, not that way.

1690
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:06,540
Can you not?

1691
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:07,680
Okay, there we go.

1692
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:09,220
No, no, no, no.

1693
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:09,580
Left.

1694
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:10,220
I mean right.

1695
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:10,640
Right.

1696
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:11,260
My right.

1697
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,020
My right.

1698
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,100
My right!

1699
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:15,640
Okay.

1700
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:30,570
I'm not gonna go diagonal.

1701
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:30,630
No.

1702
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:44,690
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1703
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:46,330
Please lift up!

1704
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:46,710
Lift up!

1705
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:47,890
Lift up!

1706
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:53,110
We're fine.

1707
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:54,590
Everything's okay.

1708
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:57,890
What if I just push it against the wall?

1709
01:49:58,910 --> 01:50:00,350
For extra stability.

1710
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:04,390
How?

1711
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:05,030
I don't know.

1712
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:07,650
I don't know.

1713
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:09,470
It's right there.

1714
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:10,470
I'm working on it.

1715
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:11,330
We're almost there.

1716
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:15,090
I'm working on it.

1717
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:23,910
I'm doing it again.

1718
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:24,750
I'm doing it again.

1719
01:50:25,290 --> 01:50:26,190
I'm doing it again.

1720
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:27,490
Please, please, please!

1721
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:43,570
Into the hole.

1722
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:47,650
Oh, this is not ASMR.

1723
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:53,410
This is negative ASMR.

1724
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:59,120
Sad rock.

1725
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:01,120
I love the sad rock vision.

1726
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,740
I don't understand what the...

1727
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:12,700
Is this supposed to annoy you to death or...

1728
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,240
Oh my god, next is a cactus.

1729
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:16,500
We go from wet to dry.

1730
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,400
Oh yeah.

1731
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,220
Wet plop.

1732
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:21,860
I know.

1733
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:24,360
It's the plop, plop, plop, plop.

1734
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:31,290
What's special about the cactus?

1735
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:33,970
Maybe it gets stuck.

1736
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:35,470
Maybe it hurts us.

1737
01:51:35,570 --> 01:51:36,410
I don't know.

1738
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:48,700
Rocks are known to be hard stoners.

1739
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:52,920
Or...

1740
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:55,820
They're... Or they're rockers.

1741
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,940
You wanna hear the song I made up when I was in school?

1742
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,280
The song I made up when I was in school...

1743
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,440
Rocks, fossils, rocks, fossils, rocks and minerals.

1744
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:15,860
Rocks, fossils, rocks, fossils, rocks and minerals.

1745
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,940
I'm just gonna continue like that.

1746
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:33,820
I don't remember ever singing Minerals.

1747
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,420
I don't remember.

1748
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:37,240
But yeah.

1749
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:43,590
What the hell?

1750
01:52:48,510 --> 01:52:49,910
Oh yeah, baby.

1751
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:50,790
Starting off strong.

1752
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:04,800
Is that your first original song?

1753
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:05,260
No.

1754
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,720
I make up original songs every day.

1755
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,120
Okay, I think it is a little slippery.

1756
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,940
Maybe that's what this is supposed to be, an issue.

1757
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:18,700
I make up songs every day.

1758
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:23,640
So I probably definitely made up more before that one.

1759
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,900
I sing them all to my cats.

1760
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:32,460
Do you have any songs for your cats?

1761
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:33,500
It's a new one every day.

1762
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:34,820
It's however I feel.

1763
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,380
You know?

1764
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:36,480
I don't know.

1765
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:44,420
I've been compared to Linda Belcher from Bob's Burgers.

1766
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:47,660
Which I don't know if that's a good thing or not.

1767
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:50,380
I was like...

1768
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,120
I forgot I could zoom out.

1769
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:54,560
Oh shoot.

1770
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:03,300
I don't know if it's a good thing or not.

1771
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:08,280
You know, I just have like an opera in my heart.

1772
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:11,220
And I have to just get it out, you know?

1773
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:15,240
It's just how it is, okay?

1774
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,840
Does each cat get a unique song?

1775
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:29,660
Yeah, like I said, it really just depends on what comes out of my brain.

1776
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,480
So...

1777
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:34,480
It's not like they have dedicated songs.

1778
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,420
It's just like...

1779
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:38,820
Oh, this one I've conjured.

1780
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:42,940
So...

1781
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:44,600
Kind of feeling, you know?

1782
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:52,420
Maybe next time I have one I'll try to record it for you guys.

1783
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:58,520
So you can understand what I'm feeling in my brain.

1784
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:01,900
Okay.

1785
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:03,320
Alright.

1786
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,460
This one is just a little slippery.

1787
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:15,330
No, no, no, okay.

1788
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:16,530
Slow and steady.

1789
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:19,030
Hold on, I got an itch.

1790
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:19,890
Okay, I got it.

1791
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:23,710
Oh, I didn't see that rock.

1792
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:30,510
Chill out, chill out.

1793
01:55:30,570 --> 01:55:31,850
We're cool, we're calm.

1794
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:32,530
We're cucumber.

1795
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:38,310
We're cucumber.

1796
01:55:40,290 --> 01:55:40,970
We're fine.

1797
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:44,190
Okay.

1798
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:49,930
I feel like this game is gonna dry out the ectoplasm in my eyes and all.

1799
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,680
I feel like I can't blink.

1800
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:07,540
Alright.

1801
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:11,700
Okay.

1802
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:19,140
This game feels so much more doable than getting over it, I swear.

1803
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:27,960
I feel like with getting over it I'm aimlessly, mindlessly swinging my little shovel.

1804
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:30,080
Blinky.

1805
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,500
For now.

1806
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,180
Oh, really?

1807
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,700
Am I still in the easy phases?

1808
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:39,280
I mean, we haven't even gotten even close to halfway, so I guess you're right.

1809
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:52,830
Some people can speedrun getting over it in like 30 seconds or something crazy.

1810
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:03,420
I think we're on stage...

1811
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:06,780
Four, I don't know actually.

1812
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:11,590
Come on.

1813
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:12,410
Break it.

1814
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:14,190
Break it.

1815
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:16,890
No, I kept pressing left for some reason.

1816
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:18,850
I'm sorry, hold on, let me break it real quick.

1817
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:21,230
Break it.

1818
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:22,490
Break it.

1819
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:23,730
Break it.

1820
01:57:24,610 --> 01:57:25,070
Break!

1821
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:26,550
Okay.

1822
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:28,030
Now go back.

1823
01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:30,910
In there, okay.

1824
01:57:34,690 --> 01:57:40,390
My middle finger hurts from pressing W.

1825
01:57:42,150 --> 01:57:43,090
What the hell?

1826
01:57:45,590 --> 01:57:46,910
Are you okay?

1827
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:49,790
Is this like his idle position?

1828
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:53,190
Alright, what's in here?

1829
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:04,060
There's just cactus.

1830
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,080
Lonely.

1831
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:07,020
Lonely.

1832
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,840
I am so lonely.

1833
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:16,960
I've got nobody to call my own.

1834
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,160
Lonely.

1835
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:22,340
I am so lonely.

1836
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,460
Okay, so you have to go through this.

1837
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:29,640
And then through the cactus again.

1838
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:38,730
What the hell is this?

1839
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:39,290
Why?

1840
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:41,430
They're trying to kill us now!

1841
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:43,450
This is not...

1842
01:58:45,170 --> 01:58:45,610
Wait!

1843
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:49,870
This is not just a normal like...

1844
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:51,070
Oh, you're going through the puddle.

1845
01:58:51,170 --> 01:58:53,170
No, now this is actual life or death.

1846
01:59:09,890 --> 01:59:11,130
Guys, how did she do it?

1847
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:12,830
How did she break the boundary?

1848
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,990
How did she do it?

1849
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:19,250
How did she do it?

1850
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:21,650
Hmm.

1851
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,900
Concrete block, eh?

1852
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:40,070
Wait.

1853
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:42,730
Like this one up here.

1854
01:59:49,130 --> 01:59:52,110
I tried climbing on the other blocks.

1855
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:54,910
Concrete block though.

1856
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:57,770
Wait, can I climb on this one?

1857
01:59:58,590 --> 01:59:59,690
Maybe I need the rock.

1858
02:00:00,330 --> 02:00:01,350
Maybe I need the rock.

1859
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,680
Kill me, I've done wrong!

1860
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,580
Kill me, I've done wrong!

1861
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:14,580
I've cheated the system!

1862
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:15,660
Wait, how do I get out?

1863
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:17,940
Okay.

1864
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:26,480
Guys, we're fine.

1865
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:34,820
But can you imagine if I told Henya I beat the game in two hours?

1866
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:41,790
I mean like...

1867
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,780
Live boulder reaction.

1868
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:52,700
I'm just seeing, I'm just scoping, I'm scoping.

1869
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:59,540
I'm scoping out the...

1870
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:04,260
I think Sisyphus should've worked smarter, not harder.

1871
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:07,700
You know, I mean...

1872
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:08,700
I think you...

1873
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:13,820
I think he could've...

1874
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:15,340
Oh my god, there's guards here!

1875
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:20,460
This game became Metal Gear.

1876
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:25,080
I wanna know what that trident is up there.

1877
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:26,940
I just wanna see what it is.

1878
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,460
Oh my gosh, they really beat you up.

1879
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,160
They beat you up.

1880
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:34,380
My rock is so sad in the...

1881
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:40,580
I'm just curious what the trident is.

1882
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:44,080
I'm just curious.

1883
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:46,900
I just wanna see what that is.

1884
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,340
I just wanna go see what it is.

1885
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:55,300
Him being too smart for his own good is what got him into this mess.

1886
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:58,280
I actually don't know what the story is.

1887
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:04,140
Why he is pushing the boulder, why he likes it.

1888
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:05,260
Or is he happy?

1889
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,400
He cheated death?

1890
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:17,400
Oh, so somebody was salty about it, it seems.

1891
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:22,140
So he cheated death, but they were like...

1892
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:29,290
The Hades?

1893
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:35,870
That's how all the myth stuff goes, you know?

1894
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:41,150
The trident is not the end, right?

1895
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:42,330
Because that would be unfortunate.

1896
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:50,330
In fact, I'll just go to here and then I'm gonna call it.

1897
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:04,530
My oshi told me to play the game properly.

1898
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:04,670
Probably.

1899
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:11,650
My oshi wants me to play the game properly, probably.

1900
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:18,580
But I mean...

1901
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:21,240
What if I took a screenshot of this and was like...

1902
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,920
I got this far...

1903
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:27,580
Wait, I can't take a screenshot because it shows my boulder all the way back there.

1904
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:33,300
I was gonna say, I got my boulder all the way here in two hours!

1905
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:40,300
I don't wanna play this game anymore!

1906
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,900
I've played this game before!

1907
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,760
How do you get over this one, actually?

1908
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:04,810
Sideways jump.

1909
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:09,710
Sideways...

1910
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:17,560
Oh my god, I thought I just heard footsteps behind me.

1911
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:18,440
That's so scary.

1912
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:23,060
What is this, Mario?

1913
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:24,540
How many A-presses?

1914
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:28,580
How many A-presses does it take to...

1915
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:29,000
What the?

1916
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:29,680
Now I can't...

1917
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:32,040
I can't jump properly anymore.

1918
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:32,760
Uh-oh.

1919
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:40,840
Half an A-press.

1920
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:44,720
I can beat this game in half an A-press.

1921
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:51,260
I can do it.

1922
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:52,860
I can do it.

1923
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:03,620
A-press is a press.

1924
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,020
You can't say it's only half an A-press.

1925
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:05,620
No, no, no.

1926
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:07,320
Yeah, I get that reference.

1927
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:10,800
What's that channel called again?

1928
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:12,140
I can't remember that guy's name.

1929
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:14,040
He always plays the...

1930
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:21,320
I kinda know how to beat this one.

1931
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:23,100
Actually, I got stuck.

1932
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:27,520
Pen and co-ax.

1933
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:27,880
Yeah!

1934
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,220
Oh dang, I thought it was me flying.

1935
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:35,060
Wait, this will be good though, right?

1936
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:36,680
When the ball goes through the...

1937
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,000
Through the tar, it gets slow.

1938
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,160
I'm like sweaty.

1939
02:05:58,380 --> 02:05:59,860
I'm chill, but I'm sweaty.

1940
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:05,720
I don't think I've had enough failure to really be so...

1941
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:10,260
So malding.

1942
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:12,740
People malded this game?

1943
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,800
People malded this game?

1944
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:24,160
You can solve any problem in life with a big enough rock.

1945
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:25,820
Scary.

1946
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:28,260
But true.

1947
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:31,200
You can build a house with a big rock.

1948
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:33,960
Uh...

1949
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:37,500
You could...

1950
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:41,600
You could eat minerals.

1951
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,840
You could find minerals in a big rock.

1952
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,540
Is this the one that I'm on?

1953
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,020
The murder level?

1954
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:53,500
Am I on murder?

1955
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:54,780
No, we're in cactus.

1956
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:55,380
That's right.

1957
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,500
I gotta go through the cactus first.

1958
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,460
Oh yeah.

1959
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:06,180
You could hunt with a big rock.

1960
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:13,480
I'm concerned, but the cactus make it look like the ball can't slip through if I accidentally lose control.

1961
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:16,420
If I lose myself in the moment.

1962
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,160
Okay, we're almost home.

1963
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:25,080
We're almost home everybody.

1964
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:36,040
Yeah, see?

1965
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:37,960
It doesn't look like it would go through.

1966
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:42,680
Maybe it would bounce off like, um...

1967
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:45,990
Like, what's it called?

1968
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:48,110
Pinball or something.

1969
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:58,110
Arms sweaty, knees weak, arms heavy, mom's spaghetti?

1970
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:01,930
Yeah.

1971
02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:03,970
Oh my gosh, this guy does look like Eminem.

1972
02:08:06,810 --> 02:08:08,270
Eminem in his tighty whities.

1973
02:08:21,140 --> 02:08:21,660
Onwards.

1974
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:22,820
That was a nice little break.

1975
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:25,820
Especially for my middle finger.

1976
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:29,680
Which is so worn out from...

1977
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:32,980
Oh, I hear it.

1978
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:34,180
I hear the sand.

1979
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,230
On the right...

1980
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:57,540
Oh, we're about to see what happens I suppose.

1981
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:04,100
I messed up.

1982
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:06,980
I'm good.

1983
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:07,700
I'm clean.

1984
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:08,520
I'm clean!

1985
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:15,600
Mental eating sand ASMR.

1986
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:16,340
No!

1987
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:16,520
No!

1988
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:20,900
Don't tell me about your hobbies.

1989
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:35,010
Eat sand.

1990
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:35,410
No!

1991
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:40,010
Oh, I'm gonna miss the sand when we go along this thing.

1992
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:43,390
I don't mind the sand.

1993
02:09:44,210 --> 02:09:45,330
I don't mind it at all.

1994
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:48,150
In fact, I've been going fast.

1995
02:09:48,170 --> 02:09:48,590
Have you noticed?

1996
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:53,230
I've been going fast through it.

1997
02:09:53,490 --> 02:09:54,330
Alright, here we go.

1998
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:55,610
The tough part.

1999
02:09:56,190 --> 02:09:57,470
The actual tough part.

2000
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:59,270
Okay.

2001
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:14,700
Alright.

2002
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:17,040
Who built this?

2003
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:24,920
Oh, come on.

2004
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:27,380
Come on.

2005
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:29,340
Little bitch.

2006
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,660
Oh, and this is the worst part.

2007
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:38,000
I have to push it down to go back up.

2008
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:50,840
Can you cheese it past?

2009
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:52,780
Let's try.

2010
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,500
I don't know.

2011
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:57,240
Let's try.

2012
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:02,230
Let's try.

2013
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:05,090
I don't think you can, but...

2014
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:07,750
What if we cheese it, like...

2015
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:10,570
Let's see what happens.

2016
02:11:11,070 --> 02:11:12,490
Let's see what happens right here.

2017
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:17,070
Wait.

2018
02:11:17,290 --> 02:11:17,570
Wait.

2019
02:11:19,870 --> 02:11:20,390
Ouch.

2020
02:11:22,090 --> 02:11:22,610
Wait.

2021
02:11:23,610 --> 02:11:24,130
Wait.

2022
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:27,110
Uh-oh.

2023
02:11:27,450 --> 02:11:27,890
Uh-oh.

2024
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:28,570
Uh-oh.

2025
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:30,630
Uh-oh.

2026
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:31,990
Uh-oh.

2027
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:33,130
Uh-oh.

2028
02:11:33,510 --> 02:11:33,990
Uh-oh.

2029
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:37,070
Why is it going the exact ways that I need it to not go?

2030
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:47,300
Okay.

2031
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:53,870
Oh my god.

2032
02:11:54,970 --> 02:11:55,750
Seriously?

2033
02:12:03,950 --> 02:12:04,490
Okay.

2034
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:10,710
Live Minto reaction.

2035
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:14,030
I wish it said that.

2036
02:12:14,110 --> 02:12:16,770
I wish it said live boulder reaction, you know?

2037
02:12:19,610 --> 02:12:20,650
Okay.

2038
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:29,080
I thought it was going right back to the start.

2039
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:29,580
No!

2040
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,560
It would have gotten caught someplace, right?

2041
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:37,120
Surely there... I mean, you would have to be the...

2042
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:39,820
The unluckiest ghost in the world...

2043
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:41,820
For it to go...

2044
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,620
All the way back to the start.

2045
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,080
You know?

2046
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:50,820
You would have to be, like...

2047
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,640
Have negative luck stat.

2048
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:56,000
And...

2049
02:13:18,410 --> 02:13:21,070
Negative... Negative luck stat.

2050
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:25,170
You know?

2051
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:31,430
I wish the cactus wouldn't...

2052
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:33,090
Wouldn't block my view.

2053
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:38,150
You would have to be so unlucky...

2054
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:40,750
And have so many...

2055
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:43,950
Things... Unlucky things happen...

2056
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:46,270
All the time in your afterlife.

2057
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:47,410
Or life.

2058
02:13:48,250 --> 02:13:50,370
Whoever's... If you're alive while playing this.

2059
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,670
Come on.

2060
02:14:03,010 --> 02:14:04,130
I messed up my chat.

2061
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:04,530
There we go.

2062
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:04,730
Okay.

2063
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:07,250
Alright.

2064
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:13,270
Alright.

2065
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,670
Nice and slow.

2066
02:14:16,270 --> 02:14:18,290
Nice and slow pace.

2067
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:18,430
Nice.

2068
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:23,480
Oh my god.

2069
02:14:23,620 --> 02:14:23,860
Please.

2070
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:24,340
Please.

2071
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:24,660
Please.

2072
02:14:34,490 --> 02:14:35,970
I wish I could...

2073
02:14:38,630 --> 02:14:39,090
Actually...

2074
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:42,450
I wish I could push it, like...

2075
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:45,810
You know, if I were to get off of the thing...

2076
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:47,630
I wish I could push it that way, you know?

2077
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:53,030
I put live boulder reaction in your live chat.

2078
02:14:53,450 --> 02:14:54,570
No way!

2079
02:14:59,450 --> 02:15:00,490
Nah, no.

2080
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:04,290
I see it!

2081
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:06,890
What?

2082
02:15:07,090 --> 02:15:08,690
Who put a wisp in...

2083
02:15:08,690 --> 02:15:13,590
You guys.

2084
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:15,590
You guys!

2085
02:15:15,770 --> 02:15:16,330
Hold on.

2086
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:18,050
I just saw the other thing.

2087
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:20,190
It showed up right underneath.

2088
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:20,910
Look at this!

2089
02:15:21,870 --> 02:15:22,930
Look at this!

2090
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:25,730
Oh my gosh.

2091
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:26,290
Sorry.

2092
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:27,690
Sorry window sound.

2093
02:15:27,690 --> 02:15:28,550
Look!

2094
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:38,560
That looks amazing, obviously, but it looks miserable to push.

2095
02:15:40,820 --> 02:15:42,580
Me as a boulder.

2096
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,860
You're not a boulder.

2097
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:48,580
You're a rock.

2098
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,900
Wow, that's amazing.

2099
02:15:56,120 --> 02:15:56,660
Okay, hold on.

2100
02:15:57,200 --> 02:16:01,380
Live boulder reaction.

2101
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:04,760
Except screw you!

2102
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,260
I don't need it!

2103
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:10,060
Because I'm never going to have that live reaction ever again!

2104
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:13,220
Okay.

2105
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:33,100
Come on.

2106
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:35,220
You son of a...

2107
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:35,940
I'm baloney!

2108
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:50,080
Um...

2109
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:01,700
He's so sensitive!

2110
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:03,120
You're so sensitive.

2111
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:10,180
That's what you should use the blow up wisp from AWA for.

2112
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:11,920
I never got that though.

2113
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,040
They didn't give it to us.

2114
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:25,340
Oh my gosh.

2115
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:25,600
Wait.

2116
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:25,960
Wait.

2117
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:26,380
Wait.

2118
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:27,680
Thank

2119
02:18:09,370 --> 02:18:13,070
you for coming to the games of Sisyphus.

2120
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:30,620
I hope you enjoyed.

2121
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:48,390
What the fuck?

2122
02:18:50,390 --> 02:18:51,990
What the fuck?

2123
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:54,050
What the fuck?

2124
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:08,970
I'm chill!

2125
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:57,520
All your Oshies like rage games.

2126
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:58,120
I know.

2127
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,100
It didn't show up on Twitter as...

2128
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:06,660
as...

2129
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:09,440
as see-through.

2130
02:20:16,300 --> 02:20:18,540
I wonder if I saved...

2131
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:21,820
I wonder if I saved...

2132
02:20:21,820 --> 02:20:23,640
Actually, I wonder.

2133
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:26,600
Hold on.

2134
02:20:32,170 --> 02:20:32,870
Let's see.

2135
02:20:34,290 --> 02:20:36,130
Where did I save the continue?

2136
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:55,200
I just watched it launch into the air!

2137
02:20:59,890 --> 02:21:00,590
Hold on.

2138
02:21:00,850 --> 02:21:01,210
Hold on.

2139
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:04,010
I'm going to move you guys and we'll all watch together, OK?

2140
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:25,940
Oh my god!

2141
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:28,100
Is it really going to go back to the very beginning?

2142
02:21:29,220 --> 02:21:30,220
Oh my god!

2143
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:32,120
Is it going to go back to the beginning?

2144
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,400
Is it actually going to do this?

2145
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:40,560
I...

2146
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:47,780
No!

2147
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:02,160
I predicted the future.

2148
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:11,300
I...

2149
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:20,260
Saved!

2150
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:22,720
You guys, that's the first level right there.

2151
02:22:24,740 --> 02:22:26,420
That's saved where?

2152
02:22:26,780 --> 02:22:28,360
It's the first level.

2153
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:32,840
It's an actual Xen loss.

2154
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:55,220
I can't...

2155
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:57,620
I can't believe it.

2156
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:58,940
I can't believe I called that.

2157
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:02,040
I can't believe...

2158
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:11,400
Do

2159
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:22,100
you guys know that episode of American Dad where it's the episode...

2160
02:23:22,100 --> 02:23:27,240
Where Roger asks everybody to roast him.

2161
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:31,680
And then after the roast, he's like cool as a cucumber the whole time.

2162
02:23:31,780 --> 02:23:36,340
And then when the roast is over, he takes off his sunglasses and he's crying.

2163
02:23:55,370 --> 02:23:56,470
American Dad.

2164
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:58,090
Yeah, I love American Dad.

2165
02:23:59,690 --> 02:24:02,130
I think I've seen almost every episode.

2166
02:24:02,130 --> 02:24:07,130
I think probably I'm not caught up on the recent season, but...

2167
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:12,310
Because I haven't looked into it, but I've seen like almost every episode of American Dad.

2168
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:17,430
Oh my god.

2169
02:24:20,210 --> 02:24:22,190
Yeah, I think...

2170
02:24:22,930 --> 02:24:25,050
I think we can still make it.

2171
02:24:33,570 --> 02:24:34,490
Wait, hold on.

2172
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:49,440
We can go.

2173
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:07,720
I earned this.

2174
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:10,360
I think I've earned this.

2175
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:13,380
I got like halfway through the game.

2176
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,920
I got halfway through the game.

2177
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:16,960
I got halfway through the game.

2178
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:29,140
Oh, the live boulder reaction.

2179
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,840
But it's not see-through.

2180
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:31,740
Oh wait, I can make it.

2181
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:32,420
I can make it see-through.

2182
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:34,380
I can make it see-through.

2183
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:36,500
There we go.

2184
02:25:53,450 --> 02:25:54,050
Good enough.

2185
02:25:58,450 --> 02:25:59,090
Good enough.

2186
02:26:03,030 --> 02:26:03,410
Wait.

2187
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:11,170
One pixel off.

2188
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:12,270
Cry about it.

2189
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:15,770
It's slightly too wide.

2190
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:16,150
It's OK.

2191
02:26:16,850 --> 02:26:17,890
Don't worry about it.

2192
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:19,630
Don't worry about it.

2193
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:25,410
American Dad reference.

2194
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:26,550
Kamiyoshi confirmed.

2195
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:26,830
Kamiyoshi confirmed.

2196
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:34,690
Don't ask me anything about Family Guy though.

2197
02:26:35,190 --> 02:26:36,590
I know no Family Guy.

2198
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:46,870
I can go the distance.

2199
02:26:49,570 --> 02:26:52,570
I know a place.

2200
02:26:57,330 --> 02:26:58,730
Wait.

2201
02:27:30,890 --> 02:27:31,130
No.

2202
02:27:44,430 --> 02:27:48,390
I can go the distance.

2203
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:52,170
I know where I'm from.

2204
02:27:52,610 --> 02:27:54,890
So I will be strong.

2205
02:27:54,890 --> 02:28:01,550
I know every mile will be worth my while.

2206
02:28:01,890 --> 02:28:10,590
I can go anywhere without a rock to rely on.

2207
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:16,090
I know, I know a place.

2208
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:19,330
It's a place.

2209
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:24,730
A place where there's a boulder.

2210
02:28:25,650 --> 02:28:28,410
It's nice and snug.

2211
02:28:29,090 --> 02:28:31,950
Gives you a warm hug.

2212
02:28:32,310 --> 02:28:36,050
How do I get over this boulder?

2213
02:28:37,830 --> 02:28:40,910
How do I get over this?

2214
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,660
Try A, D.

2215
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:50,560
A, D, jump.

2216
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:52,780
Like at the same time?

2217
02:28:59,030 --> 02:28:59,790
Oh my gosh.

2218
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:02,790
Running diagonally.

2219
02:29:06,210 --> 02:29:07,090
Hold on.

2220
02:29:09,810 --> 02:29:13,270
Yeah, I know I got stuck here before because I couldn't figure it out.

2221
02:29:15,010 --> 02:29:15,610
Oh my goodness.

2222
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:16,030
No.

2223
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:17,230
Diagonal.

2224
02:29:18,270 --> 02:29:19,130
Hold on, I got it.

2225
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:22,830
Wait, so if I like...

2226
02:29:22,830 --> 02:29:24,510
What are you talking about from here?

2227
02:29:25,290 --> 02:29:26,590
Running towards the fence.

2228
02:29:26,590 --> 02:29:27,130
What is this?

2229
02:29:42,090 --> 02:29:43,170
You

2230
02:29:50,110 --> 02:30:00,180
can go through the gap.

2231
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:06,240
Good.

2232
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:21,470
Like that, but the right way.

2233
02:30:32,170 --> 02:30:36,470
Maybe if I try from this side.

2234
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:48,880
Oh!

2235
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:00,560
So close.

2236
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:04,460
What

2237
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:09,570
am I doing wrong?

2238
02:31:12,890 --> 02:31:15,770
It's easier if you bring the rock down.

2239
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:17,310
Glee!

2240
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:25,280
I think you can just glitch through the corner.

2241
02:31:39,690 --> 02:31:41,230
My name is Glee.

2242
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:42,710
You are so true!

2243
02:31:46,130 --> 02:31:48,330
Just play normally with the rock?

2244
02:31:53,210 --> 02:31:54,890
You do understand.

2245
02:31:55,390 --> 02:31:57,730
It took me two and a half hours to get to this point.

2246
02:31:58,350 --> 02:31:59,970
Actually, I didn't even get to this point.

2247
02:32:07,300 --> 02:32:08,620
Mods, ban him!

2248
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:14,480
How did she do it?

2249
02:32:15,020 --> 02:32:16,360
How did she game?

2250
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:18,220
How did she game?

2251
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:19,500
Run along the fence.

2252
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:28,750
I'm running.

2253
02:32:29,610 --> 02:32:31,090
I'm running in slow motion.

2254
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:37,200
Wait, no!

2255
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:39,320
No!

2256
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:40,540
Rock!

2257
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:45,600
You think they patched it?

2258
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:48,320
No way.

2259
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:50,280
No.

2260
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:02,060
When is the last time this game got an update?

2261
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:08,240
September?

2262
02:33:08,780 --> 02:33:09,820
Wait, June?

2263
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:12,700
No, it's a Japanese translation.

2264
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:14,100
Minor update.

2265
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:16,100
No.

2266
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:20,560
When did she play it?

2267
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:25,160
When did she play it?

2268
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:27,620
I don't see anything as of...

2269
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:30,300
As of a long time ago.

2270
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:33,900
So, you know, I think we are good.

2271
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:36,700
Wait, a long time ago.

2272
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:38,060
Hold on, I'm going to look it up.

2273
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,480
I'm looking it up.

2274
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:57,780
Oh, I see.

2275
02:33:57,960 --> 02:33:59,700
I see where she is playing it.

2276
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:00,060
Hold on.

2277
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:03,340
Let's see how she gets over it.

2278
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:06,100
She played it in May.

2279
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:06,200
Let's see.

2280
02:34:14,210 --> 02:34:15,230
Oh, I see!

2281
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:16,490
She does glitch over it.

2282
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:20,590
Wait, sorry guys.

2283
02:34:20,710 --> 02:34:21,370
Let me bring it back.

2284
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:28,210
We watched the pro master do it.

2285
02:34:34,090 --> 02:34:38,910
Just jump on top by glitching over it.

2286
02:34:43,340 --> 02:34:44,140
Can you?

2287
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:58,320
I don't know if you can hear me, but I am...

2288
02:35:02,020 --> 02:35:03,700
I am spamming jump!

2289
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:05,420
Can you hear this?

2290
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:25,460
I'm doing it.

2291
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:26,480
I'm sprinting, yeah.

2292
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:29,120
Do I need to just jump at the same time?

2293
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:31,100
Or jump only?

2294
02:35:52,330 --> 02:35:54,610
Spam harder for ASMR.

2295
02:35:59,240 --> 02:36:01,500
Why doesn't it work?

2296
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:05,620
Why doesn't it work?

2297
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:06,880
Help

2298
02:36:16,310 --> 02:36:19,130
me out!

2299
02:36:21,810 --> 02:36:23,550
Oh, my chat broke.

2300
02:36:36,730 --> 02:36:37,890
I give up.

2301
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:45,270
I suck at the game.

2302
02:36:45,650 --> 02:36:46,510
I can't beat the game.

2303
02:36:46,950 --> 02:36:49,770
I can't beat even glitching through it.

2304
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:26,860
Break the cycle.

2305
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:34,200
You can be your own man.

2306
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:40,080
You don't have to stay here.

2307
02:37:41,940 --> 02:37:43,360
Break the cycle.

2308
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:47,780
It ends with you.

2309
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:55,980
It ends with me.

2310
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:11,370
Uninstall the game.

2311
02:38:14,650 --> 02:38:18,710
Uninstall the game.

2312
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:24,350
Uninstall the game.

2313
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:28,750
Uninstall the game!

2314
02:38:32,910 --> 02:38:34,310
Uninstall.

2315
02:38:34,930 --> 02:38:36,070
Uninstall.

2316
02:38:37,470 --> 02:38:40,750
Uninstall, uninstall.

2317
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,700
Uninstall, uninstall.

2318
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:12,080
Where

2319
02:39:21,990 --> 02:39:23,490
are you guys?

2320
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:26,230
There you are.

2321
02:39:28,410 --> 02:39:29,070
Otsumita!

2322
02:39:29,550 --> 02:39:30,530
Thanks guys!

2323
02:39:32,070 --> 02:39:34,410
Sorry I couldn't beat the game at all.

2324
02:39:35,210 --> 02:39:38,030
But I think I actually won in life.

2325
02:39:38,270 --> 02:39:39,070
After life.

2326
02:39:39,070 --> 02:39:50,030
By not doing anything at all!

2327
02:39:50,170 --> 02:39:50,590
Yeah!

2328
02:39:51,550 --> 02:39:53,050
You won the war!

2329
02:39:53,530 --> 02:39:53,830
True!

2330
02:39:57,110 --> 02:39:57,790
Yes!

2331
02:39:57,850 --> 02:39:59,590
We won the war!

2332
02:40:00,510 --> 02:40:02,650
And you know how many... This game is 7 gigs.

2333
02:40:03,990 --> 02:40:08,110
So now I have plenty of space for more...

2334
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:12,710
I'm gonna go save a meme!

2335
02:40:13,130 --> 02:40:13,530
Yeah!

2336
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:16,770
Otsumita everybody!

2337
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:17,950
Thank you!

2338
02:40:18,970 --> 02:40:23,470
I will see you guys when I see you next!

2339
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:26,270
And if there is an announcement on Friday, then there might be.

2340
02:40:26,470 --> 02:40:27,530
If not, there is one next week.

2341
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:29,410
Oh my gosh!

2342
02:40:29,470 --> 02:40:30,790
And also next week is Valentine's Day!

2343
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:35,650
And I said that next week I'm gonna be only nice to you guys.

2344
02:40:36,410 --> 02:40:36,890
So...

2345
02:40:38,230 --> 02:40:39,190
You might...

2346
02:40:40,570 --> 02:40:42,790
You might get all nice stuff.

2347
02:40:42,910 --> 02:40:43,770
Also that aid!

2348
02:40:43,870 --> 02:40:44,370
Thank you!

2349
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:44,970
Congratulations!

2350
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:45,390
You won!

2351
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:45,790
I did!

2352
02:40:45,890 --> 02:40:46,610
Thanks for the donut!

2353
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:48,350
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2354
02:40:49,910 --> 02:40:50,390
Promise?

2355
02:40:50,670 --> 02:40:53,390
Yeah, it's gonna be niceness week.

2356
02:40:55,430 --> 02:40:57,050
Niceness for Valentine's Day.

2357
02:40:57,430 --> 02:40:57,670
OK!

2358
02:40:58,450 --> 02:40:58,930
Otsumita!

2359
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:00,330
Bye bye!
