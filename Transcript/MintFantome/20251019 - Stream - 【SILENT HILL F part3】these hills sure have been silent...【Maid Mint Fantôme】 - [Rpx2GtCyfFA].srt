Do you read Shimiko Blue Archive?

23
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:58,390
I saw, I woke up, I checked Twitter, and I immediately saw everybody being like, Shimiko, Shimiko, Shimiko, and I was like, what's happening?

24
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:06,970
And then, and then they were saying that, or I saw like her, what was it, the outfit and everything.

25
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,220
And all I could think of was, oh my gosh, I'm so happy.

26
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,280
happy for Ayami mama.

27
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm so happy for Ayami mama.

28
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:33,200
I know she's she has tried so hard to to push Shimiko and I hope that this is one of the big things that really pushes her out there so yeah I'm happy.

29
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm so happy.

30
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,600
This is the one thing I love so much about Ayami mama.

31
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,620
She cares so much about all everything that she draws you know.

32
00:05:43,060 --> 00:06:10,210
Every every person every character so it's something I really really love about yummy mama well I'm drinking hot tea so that hopefully in my maybe I'll maybe my lungs will something because luckily my throat doesn't hurt anymore my cough is all from my chest.

33
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,990
It's nice when it feels personal.

34
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,130
So, hmm.

36
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,890
But anyway, welcome back to Silent Hill F.

37
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,650
We just ended on the boss, right?

38
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,850
I just, I just, it was, oh my gosh, what's her name?

39
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,690
Now I'm wanting to say Shimiko.

40
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,990
It's, it's a big word.

41
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,890
Thank you so much for the gifted!

42
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,790

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,250
Thank you so much!

44
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,470
Thank you, thank you!

45
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,890
Sakuko, thank you.

46
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:50,770
Sakuko.

47
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,250
I was like, I know it ends with a ko.

48
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,270
Everybody's names end with a ko.

49
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,250
Hinako, Sakuko, Rinko, everybody is ko.

50
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,550
Oh yeah, I chose this time.

51
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,010
I'm trying to be more consistent with my schedules.

52
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,850
Whereas I have Wednesday off and Sunday off.

53
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,210
And then Saturday I want to do like an EU friendly stream.

54
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,410
I'm so sorry that today's EU friendly stream is the middle of a game.

55
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,810
So, but hopefully it's still okay.

56
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,930
Lord Kratos, I thank you so much for the time gifted.

57
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,080
Kamakuras, happy birthday!

58
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,300
Happy, happy birthday!

59
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,820
But yeah, I want to be more consistent with my schedule.

60
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,560
scheduling.

61
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,820
Where was I going with that?

62
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,480
I don't remember.

63
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,620
I don't remember.

64
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,200
But that's okay.

65
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,240
Oh, that's right.

66
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,620
I picked this early time because I was like, oh, I want to play a lot more.

67
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,180
I think we have still so much to get through in the game.

68
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,740
So I was like, I really want to lock in and knock out a good, decent chunk today.

69
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,060
But then I was like, we'll see.

70
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,560
If my cough goes away, end up starting to feel better.

71
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,220
I will play because it's not my throat that's hurting, so it's okay.

72
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,100
It's just hard to breathe a little bit, so.

73
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:32,290
How can I sleep well at night knowing my cute ghost mid is moldy and dusty?

74
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,190
Where did the dusty come from?

75
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,270
Wait!

76
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,670
You're making stuff up!

77
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,650

but probably it's not going to happen.

81
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,880
You know.

82
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,900
Road trip.

83
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,140
Okay.

84
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,600
Oh my gosh.

85
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,000
We have to go so far out.

86
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,540
Ah!

87
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,260
I have to go back through.

88
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,200
No.

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,020
I have to go back through the fields.

90
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,920
No, please.

91
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,500
No.

92
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,420
Wait.

93
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:11,940
Eh?

94
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,780
But there's Xs everywhere.

95
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,420
Eh?

96
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,860
How do I get back over there?

97
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,140
Hmm?

98
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,440
Maybe that's X.

99
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:51,340
right there in the middle of the screen how do i do oh there maybe this way but it's crossed out do i have but everywhere back to the fields is crossed out too because i went through this house it only looks like it's a one-way moment of appreciation for how gorgeous the map is i know right wait the but the house is one way let's check out this x and see if maybe It's opened up for us.

100
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,780
Whoa!

101
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,500
What is that?

102
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
You see that over there?

103
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,780
The big lump of flesh?

104
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,460
Um, what is that?

105
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,100
I'm going the right way, right?

106
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,980
Okay, yeah.

107
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,440
Alright.

108
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,980
What is this?

109
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,120
Um...

110
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,300
Uh...

111
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,720
Uh...

112
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,520
Why would you say that?

113
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,360
Horror stories are well known for their happy endings, especially Silent Hill.

114
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,200
Especially Silent Hill, especially things created by Japanese creators.

115
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,120
Okay, wait, hold on.

116
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,040
I also have to remember.

117
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,460
Okay, this is how I...

118
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,860
Okay, oh, this is my focus.

119
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,140
Okay, there we go.

120
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,820
There's my medicine.

121
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

122
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,660
Okay, so we know that this is a bad way.

123
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,140
All right.

124
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,720
Hope you've been practicing your swing.

125
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,440
Good old Shu, but he's been quietly cheering Hinako on from his house while watching her from a telescope way over there.

126
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,540
Yeah, that's our guy.

127
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
That's our friend.

128
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:09,960
Yep.

129
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,620
So maybe whatever was blocking this over here, I don't remember what it was.

130
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,500
Wait, I see a person.

131
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,740
Is that Shu?

132
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,300
Oh, I think it's Shu.

133
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,360
Okay, cool.

134
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,940
So we're just following him.

135
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,220
Oh, and Rinko's there too.

136
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,860
I wish you guys would stop abandoning me.

137
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,000
Hello.

138
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,580
Why are you such a hater?

139
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,060
Isn't that what you would want, Nico, that you don't want him to treat her like a girl?

140
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,880
Right.

141
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,480
Like, wouldn't you want that because then he doesn't see her as a girl?

142
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:40,620
and then they're not she's not a rival right is that not the way of thinking I don't know I don't understand her with friends like Nico who needs enemies right oh gosh okay okay so yeah now it's opened up why was it closed before I don't remember okay perfect we don't have to the game is so kind it's not I also heard,

143
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:49,960
or I read somebody in the comments saying that, if you break your weapon, they will spawn another one on the screen.

144
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,460
So that's very nice.

145
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,820
Adding back to Tokyo this year!

146
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,320
Really want to catch some small idol shows, recommendations, where to look for tickets, or groups to look out for.

147
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,480
Thank you for haunting.

148
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,460
Small idols.

149
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,560
It really depends on your taste.

150
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,340
Uh, you can find a show happening every day.

151
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:15,880
Ah!

152
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,380
Ah!

153
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,510
Mint is small idle.

154
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,470
What are you saying?

155
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,430
What are you saying?

156
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,890
You think they're still in there?

157
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,570
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

158
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,330
This game scares me.

159
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,650
Okay.

160
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,430
What was up here?

161
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,350
Have I gone up there?

162
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,930
I went all the way up there?

163
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,330
I don't remember that.

164
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,310
Yeah, I think I'm gonna sneeze.

165
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:49,950
Oh no.

166
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:50,910
Please.

167
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,390
I don't want to sneeze.

168
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,250
Oh, it hurts.

169
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,690
Wait, I want to sneeze.

170
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,290
I don't want to sneeze.

171
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm fine.

172
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,940
What is that?

173
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,300
Is that flesh?

174
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,520
It's not moving.

175
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,480
Oh, it is definitely...

176
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,040
fleshy of the fleshy variety.

177
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,690
Just waiting for the jump scares?

178
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,250
Yeah, I'm scared.

179
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,850
Wait, okay.

180
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,970
Let's plan a route, right?

181
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,710
Because everything is blocked off.

182
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,990
So much stuff is blocked off at least.

183
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,550
Where am I supposed to get there?

184
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,890
Like, I'm sure they'll...

185
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,850
Yay!

186
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,830
Can we keep going?

187
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,610
Just ignore her.

188
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,790
Things are getting a little...

189
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,110
Oh, my friends are over there!

190
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,210
They're waiting for me!

191
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,630
Everything is so fleshy.

192
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,950
Everything is getting worse!

193
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,250
Oh, golly.

194
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,890
Um...

195
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,730
Yes?

196
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,990
What's wrong?

197
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,030
Why music?

198
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,570
Hello?

199
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,970
Is it my friends?

200
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,870
Oh gosh.

201
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:36,070
Why is she so weird?

202
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,010
Also, I just realized something, give me one second after.

203
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,870
One second.

204
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,250
Why is she so weird, though?

205
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,090
Okay, so we're going this way.

206
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,430
One second.

207
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,370
I think I have the brightness up.

208
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:09,890
One second.

209
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,510
I did!

210
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,850
Oh my gosh, I did.

211
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:16,790
oopsie

212
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:53,020
and then also that okay oh my gosh i had a bunch of stuff that for something else i was doing oopsie there we go okay i was like wait i was looking at obs seriously i was like why is it so bright hmm space wars space wars wasn't just about fighting evil with laser guns We'd pretend to analyze the enemy by drawing alien sketches.

213
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,920
During PE, we'd say that the class was a training camp for the space army.

214
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,100
I think we played with dolls too.

215
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,940
Right.

216
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,760
I think that's when we were training in first aid in order to assist the injured.

217
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,460
Wow, they got really into the space wars thing.

218
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,920
I walk this path every time I go to Rinkos, but to be honest, to this day, I'm still scared that I might get lost.

219
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,940
I mean, I've been told that I should probably just ask an adult.

220
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:35,490
for directions if i get lost but then i remember that one time when i walked on the footpath of the rice fields for fun and got smacked by an old farmer all of a sudden the trauma from the experience made me scared of adults back then and even to this day why did he smack her

221
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:50,140
why is the musical freaky though it's not behind me is it okay no it's just scary for no reason

222
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,680
Uh, sure.

223
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,900
I don't have enough, right?

224
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,080
Oh, I only have one of each, so I'm not going to do that.

225
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,820
It's 500.

226
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,620
Yeah, it's 500 for the Omamori.

227
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,020
And then increased abilities is also 500.

228
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,180
Oh, okay, okay.

229
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,480
Just randomly getting smacked by old farmer.

230
00:19:28,600 --> 00:20:00,200
normal day in japan i suppose okay so yeah see everything's getting more and more red oh my gosh if we go straight what if i feel like maybe it's this path maybe the truck has somehow been moved maybe that one guy moved it or so the big monster one of the most useful life hacks i wish i learned much earlier in life is you can suppress by pressing the roof of your mouth with your tongue.

231
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,800
Yeah, but like, when you guys suppress a sneeze, doesn't your nose get more clogged?

232
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,560
That happens to me.

233
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,980
You see how I sound all sniffly now?

234
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,080
Oh.

235
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,580
Okay, so this way is blocked.

236
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,760
Catch up with Shu and Linko.

237
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,570
I hear one, though.

238
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,710
Oh, I hear it over there.

239
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,710
Okay.

240
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,770
Wait, it hasn't been mine.

241
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,770
Mark just blocked it.

242
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,770
Oh!

243
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,330
A baseball bat!

244
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,410
What's it called?

245
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,970
An ordinary wooden bat.

246
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,570
I would play with this a lot, so I feel right at home.

247
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,350
Oh!

248
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,110
Wait, I got to keep the sickle?

249
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,950
Oh, the sickle's about to break it, it looks like.

250
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,510
I think.

251
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,620
But also...

252
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,800
I think...

253
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,600
I think it probably would be better to get rid of one of the pipes.

254
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,500
I think the sickle was really good though, no?

255
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,820
If I could repair...

256
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,140
I don't...

257
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,160
You get a repair toolkit, right?

258
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,220
Okay, hold on.

259
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:26,620
Oops.

260
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,060
Oops.

261
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,180
Trying to remember how to change my weapon.

262
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:31,920
There we go.

263
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,640
Okay, okay.

264
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,720
Let's try the baseball bat.

265
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,030
I don't like it.

266
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,190
I don't like it.

267
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,610
Now is it marked off?

268
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,430
What the heck?

269
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,110
Why isn't it marking it though?

270
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,290
Because like, it can't cross, you know?

271
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,690
Maybe if I get real close and personal.

272
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,590
Okay, there we go.

273
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,630
I'd like to have my map updated, please.

274
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,010
Up to date.

275
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,220
Catch up with them.

276
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,040
Where did they go?

277
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
Oh, there's two of them.

278
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,300
Okay.

279
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,560
I need to be careful.

280
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,200
Oh gosh, there's two of them.

281
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,900
Oh, I wish I had a gun!

282
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,320
Well, this one is in the fence, so...

283
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,140
Maybe it's okay.

284
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,180
I wish I could go.

285
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,620
I'll win.

286
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,680
Okay, walk away now.

287
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,200
Thank you.

288
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,600
Oh gosh, this one's...

289
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,400
coming back they're gonna hear me they're gonna hear me attack and both double team me

290
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,140
gosh okay hold on i'm gonna try and time this

291
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:10,900
oh my god it's so scary i don't like them at all

292
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,460
uh oh wait did they come after me no stinking way

293
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,200
ah there's three of them oh my god God, it's time to go.

294
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:35,800
It's time to go.

295
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,380
It's time to go.

296
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,840
Oh, wait!

297
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,420
We can't run!

298
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm so lost.

299
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,900
Wait, I'm lost now.

300
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Wait.

301
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,420
Where am I?

302
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,020
Scary!

303
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,520
Okay, there's apparently an alleyway right in front of me.

304
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,240
Take your pills if I can even.

305
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,340
Run, run, run, run.

306
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:12,940
Oh, God.

307
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,260
I can't run anymore.

308
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:48,200
stamina run run run run run run where's my pills take my pills take my pills okay maybe they're not following me anymore i saw something over in that yard too i couldn't grab it though too scary why can i look at the sign real men drink otori beer thank you

309
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,580
Let's see if there's anything over here.

310
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,460
Oh, wait.

311
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,820
Actually, I have to go this way, I think.

312
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,240
Maybe?

313
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,220
Gosh.

314
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,760
That was so bad.

315
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,860
Ah!

316
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,740
If it's just one, though, maybe it's okay.

317
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,480
Oh my gosh.

318
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:10,900
Nice.

319
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,680
Nice dodge.

320
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,140
Nice dodge.

321
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,080
Yeah!

322
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:27,960
Oh my god there's so much combat in this game it's kind of insane

323
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,700
I wonder where it puts me back at all the way here okay

324
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,740
this is fine man

325
00:25:46,960 --> 00:26:06,180
That's one thing I heard of a complaint about this game was like the combat gets like especially towards the end there's so much combat i'm gonna look for more items while i'm here aha aha thank you thank you

326
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,220
if you can beat this you can beat dark souls is that the consensus

327
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:30,160
is that the consensus now all right this off okay uh what was it here we go

328
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:54,490
gosh okay so we know that there's three i just have to run away from them but i know where to go this time now uh when i get to the steel yard i turn left okay

329
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,210
I wonder if I have a...

330
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,690
Wait, no.

331
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,130
If I have a tool repair kit?

332
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,030
I have one!

333
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,350
I could use it on the sickle.

334
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,570
Let's try it.

335
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,150
Wait, full.

336
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,930
What do you mean full?

337
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,590
Maybe I switched...

338
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,230
Oh.

339
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,100
Oh, halfway?

340
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,680
Okay.

341
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,310
I think I'm just gonna run for it.

342
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,170
We're running, we're running, we're running, we're running, we're running, we're running.

343
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,050
I'm dodging.

344
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,290
I'm not dodging.

345
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,090
I'm running.

346
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:51,890
I'm dodging.

347
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,510
I'm dodging.

348
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,190
I'm running.

349
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,050
Oh shit, wrong way.

350
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:54,830
I'm running.

351
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:55,430
I'm running.

352
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,170
I'm running.

353
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:56,870
I'm running.

354
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,430
They're not following me.

355
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,550
They're... uh... following me?

356
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,990
They're not following me?

357
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,720
They're... not following me?

358
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,930
Winner.

359
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,890
Yay.

360
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,310
Oh, God, she scared me.

361
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,490
Wait, you were over here the whole time?

362
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,650
Okay, please help me!

363
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,590
I'm scared!

364
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,680
Aibo!

365
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,900
Oh, Dinko looking real sussy over there.

366
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,480
More higashi.

367
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,360
Wait, what's over here though?

368
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,460
Jump scare?

369
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,040
A shoulder bag?

370
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,020
Increases inventory capacity!

371
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,560
That's huge!

372
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,740
Huge!

373
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Huge!

374
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,300
Let's stay away from there.

375
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,080
More stuff.

376
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,240
Awesome.

377
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
I didn't even have to use any capsules.

378
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,200
Actually, did I get hurt?

379
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,260
No, we're good.

380
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,460
Oh,

381
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,460
so scary.

382
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,580
Oh, why is my controller?

383
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,900
Oh, it's this thing again.

384
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,370
Let's not.

385
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,050
I don't think we can beat it.

386
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,510
I don't think we can beat it.

387
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:22,790
That would be nice, avoiding the town.

388
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,910
So how's my placement?

389
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:43,770
I forgot to ask if I'm not so badly in the way or anything.

390
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,310
If you guys can see.

391
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,430
Wait, you're just going to leave me in the middle of the street with that thing behind me?

392
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,110
Yeah, let's go.

393
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,150
Cut through alleyways.

394
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,930
Wait, what's my journal saying?

395
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:57,510
Middle school.

396
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,910
I'm not blocking anything.

397
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,530
Okay, cool.

398
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,670
This is the middle school that I attended.

399
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,570
It was built when the town was financially well off during the dam construction.

400
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,530
So the beautiful facilities are at odds with the rest of the dull buildings in town.

401
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,430
I think I met Nico during my first year here.

402
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,790
I remember her surprise when she heard that I called Shu Ibo.

403
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:22,830
Partner.

404
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,370
Howdy, partner.

405
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,990
Okay, so we're going through...

406
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,210
Allie...

407
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,630
Wait, where's the current object?

408
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,030
Oh, okay.

409
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,490
Okay.

410
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,830
Cut through alleyways.

411
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,410
Uh.

412
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:43,930
Okay.

413
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,230
I don't...

414
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,690
Are they not going to be on the map?

415
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,140
The fact that I can hear that thing behind me is, like, so scary.

416
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,360
That's cute.

417
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,100
Looks like I could pick that up.

418
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,030
Oh, my God.

419
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,050
We need to just run.

420
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,660
Where's the alleyways, please?

421
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,780
This way.

422
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,900
Alleyway.

423
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,700
Yeah, kuso for real.

424
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,520
Some actual shit.

425
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,820
Kuso for real.

426
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,260
Okay.

427
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,160
Alleyways.

428
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,060
Towards every sokauk, I'm going to school.

429
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,320
Everything is, like, blocked off this way.

430
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,400
I guess we just keep going.

431
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,270
Oh my god.

432
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,370
Time to fight.

433
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,520
I'll try to grab that.

434
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,530
Ooh, it's...

435
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,830
It's losing, what's it called, real fast, though.

436
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,530
It's so good!

437
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,470
Oh, it's so good, though.

438
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,210
The sickle is so good.

439
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:20,870
Dang.

440
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,250
Ah, I took it!

441
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,710
Lucky, so lucky.

442
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:31,950
Awesome!

443
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,890
Ah, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

444
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,050
Okay, we're good.

445
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,090
Yeah, it kills them so fast.

446
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,790
It's so good.

447
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:45,010
I thought I saw something else, but I might have been seeing things.

448
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,310
You know what?

449
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:45,660
It's fine.

450
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,440
Wait, is this a...

451
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,380
Ah!

452
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,380
And where am I supposed to go?

453
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,250

454
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:30,450

456
00:34:47,400 --> 00:35:01,940

458
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:34,260

459
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,360
I feel like I'm just being...

460
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,460
I feel like I'm...

461
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,000
What's the word?

462
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,980
Overthinking it a little bit.

463
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,180
We could get rid of some Higashi.

464
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,940
I don't remember what it does.

465
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,980
Restore stamina.

466
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,880
Guys...

467
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,340
Hint.

468
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,780
Hint, please!

469
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,280
Wait.

470
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,300
Wait.

471
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,440
Oh my gosh, wait.

472
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,800
Is that not the one that was just chasing after me?

473
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,300
Don't notice me.

474
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,900
Wait, how do I lock on again?

475
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,700
How do I lock on again?

476
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,330
Ah!

477
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,190
I got it.

478
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,370
Oh, shh!

479
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,990
I think I had no stamina.

480
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:16,570
Ew.

481
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,030
Ouch.

482
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:18,930
Ouch.

483
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,210
Die!

484
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,090
Oh, it's dead.

485
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,350
Hate.

486
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,050
So punishing.

487
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,490
Alright.

488
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,830

Oh, I see it in the...

496
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,980
I see it in the water.

497
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,060
Okay, we turn around.

498
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,740
You can't get me.

499
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,680
You can't get me.

500
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,460
I mean, you can.

501
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,760
But not there.

502
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,200
What's that?

503
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,220
What was that?

504
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,140
Oh my god.

505
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,960
Are you just coming up here?

506
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,330
Come on.

507
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,650
I thought these things were supposed to be blind.

508
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,090
How do they notice me?

509
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,650
Maybe it is blind.

510
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,350
Stupid, never mind, just kidding.

511
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,170
You're not blind.

512
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,250
Oh, oh, oh, how did you notice?

513
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,970
I'm standing here quietly.

514
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,850
Ah, nice.

515
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,030
I'll tell you though, I'm not sure I'm a fan of the combat.

516
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,530
Maybe, I don't know.

517
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,930
Maybe I just don't like Silent Hill games.

518
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,610
Maybe that's it.

519
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,790
I thought I heard the sussy noise coming from over here.

520
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,850
Do I investigate?

521
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:15,770
Question.

522
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,230
Because I don't remember.

523
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,150
Does the shrine heal me?

524
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,310
When I go pray?

525
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,610
I don't think it does, does it?

526
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,350

527
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,800

529
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:08,960
What is my health?

530
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,720
Actually, we can probably take a pill.

531
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,560
Take a peel, take a chill peel.

532
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,740
What's this?

533
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,860
I got it.

534
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,160
Anything else over here?

535
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,700
Like a thing to repair?

536
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,200
Toolkit?

537
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,340
Do I need toolkits around?

538
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,700
I'm collecting toolkits now.

539
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,540
It's my main source.

540
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,000
My friends are missing.

541
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,780
Oh, I remember this area.

542
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,080
Oh, this area sucks.

543
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,300
Oh, gosh.

544
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,200
Yeah, this is, like, kind of where we first started-ish.

545
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:00,740
I remember.

546
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,100
Okay.

547
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,100
Ah!

548
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,040
It just says catch up.

549
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,800
Wait, okay, hold on.

550
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,320
What if I do?

551
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,560
Oh, catch up with Shu and Rinko at the middle school.

552
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:13,760
Idiot.

553
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,280
Dummy.

554
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,760
Oh, my gosh.

555
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,420
It's ugly.

556
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,000
It's pretty ugly.

557
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,880
It's going to come back over here, though.

558
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,200
It's gonna notice me.

559
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,340
I like watching the move though.

560
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,860
They're so freaky.

561
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,280
The monsters in this game are so...

562
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,180
Actually, I have to go that way.

563
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:36,960
Um...

564
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,760
Could you please?

565
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,800
This is the right way?

566
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,500
Okay, thank you.

567
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm too scared to explore in this game.

568
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,540
The way they like, Twitch?

569
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,520
Ugh.

570
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,540
Oh, it hurts so good.

571
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,140
Oh.

572
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,940
I took one step.

573
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,720
That's so funny.

574
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:09,070
Oop.

575
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:09,610
Oop.

576
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,190
Oop.

577
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:10,990
Oh my gosh.

578
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:11,370
Ah!

579
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,090
No, no.

580
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:12,770
I'm trying to move.

581
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:13,550
I'm trying to move.

582
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:14,710
Oh my god.

583
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,870
The lock-on kind of screws me up, though.

584
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,830
I'm not gonna lie.

585
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:19,910
I can't!

586
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,130
Ah!

587
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,220
Oh, okay.

588
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:27,820
Just kidding.

589
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Oh, please, please, please.

590
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:30,380
Wait.

591
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,040
Ah, shit.

592
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,920
Please, take your pill.

593
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,380
Wait, I don't know what that just did.

594
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,800
Oh, nice.

595
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,040
Ouch.

596
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,380
I tried to dodge, but I'm stupid.

597
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,680
Oh, wait, hold on.

598
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:43,940
Okay.

599
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,080
Block on.

600
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,840
Where are you?

601
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,340
Wait.

602
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,660
Block on.

603
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,380
Okay, there we go.

604
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,620
Yeah.

605
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,300
Oh, oh, I can't get my dang bearings in this game sometimes!

606
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,800
Okay, I think I got it.

607
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,260
Oh.

608
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,680
Oh, oh.

609
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,840
Holy moly.

610
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,400
Let's just, uh...

611
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,160
When did I switch weapons?

612
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,400
Probably out of Scaredy, Scaredy Catness.

613
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,780
Out of button mashing.

614
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,420
We'll stick with...

615
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,180
I don't want to like waste it, but...

616
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh wait, look at that!

617
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,320
A new pipe.

618
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Let's switch out this pipe for this pipe.

619
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,890
Yeah, there we go.

620
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,050
Panic swap.

621
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,190
Yeah, I like panic mashed trying to get through the...

622
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,990
Trying to find my way over here.

623
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,410
Oh, I see.

624
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,410
Thank you so much for letting me get to take you!

625
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,510
Thank you so much!

626
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,010
All right.

627
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,510
Is that...

628
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,410
I feel like...

629
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,430
Probably the ways have opened up now.

630
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,200
Probably things have opened up.

631
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,570
I hear something though.

632
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,390
I hear...

633
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,310
What?

634
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,390
Why are you in there?

635
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:40,770
What?

636
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,230
What's going on?

637
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,130
What?

638
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,570
What's flying?

639
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,130
What's going on?

640
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,330
How did you guys get in there?

641
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,260
Ikki, nasty, nasty.

642
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,280
Sorry, I know I'm like constantly moving the camera around.

643
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:12,020
I'm checking for enemies and I'm also checking for items, so I'm like very sporadically just...

644
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,280
My eyes are darting left and right.

645
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,420
What's happening?

646
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:24,160
I love vase break dot mp3.

647
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,340
And if I miss something, please feel free to point it out to me.

648
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,680
That was so funny.

649
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,920
Wait, that sound like totally took me out of the environment.

650
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,050
Oh, did you see that guy up there?

651
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:51,750
Oh, no.

652
00:47:54,270 --> 00:48:16,290
was the guy that was that was making the horrible noise earlier too oh yeah a hundred percent oh gosh oh the game hasn't given me an excessive amount of pills yet though so maybe i'm saying how much do i have anyway

653
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,690
this game has vine boom wait you're kidding right

654
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,610
Okay, I don't think he's there anymore.

655
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,210
I need to go down the stairs.

656
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,770
But first, what is this?

657
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:50,890
Peels!

658
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:52,710
Thank you.

659
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,170
Anything in here?

660
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:58,010
No?

661
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,750
Don't be scared by the monsters.

662
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,990
Hinako Seifuku continually...

663
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:06,910
Yeah, we just look at the Seifuku.

664
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,730
Yeah, continually going, is there for you.

665
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,310
The back of her Seifuku has got your back.

666
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:13,450
Thank you!

667
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,550
I know, look at you guys.

668
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,930
We pointed it out last time, but you guys see the eyes and the tongue going bleh.

669
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:19,610
bleh.

670
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,470
Yeah, that's a great question.

671
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:29,430
Oh.

672
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:30,210
Oh.

673
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,550
Yeah, where have my friends gone?

674
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,050
Why have they abandoned me so?

675
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,050
Oh, nice.

676
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,610
They like run so...

677
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:58,870
Fast!

678
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,910
Hinako!

679
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,530
This way!

680
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,370
Are you leading me to a trap?

681
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,070
What do you mean this way?

682
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,390
This way?

683
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:15,910
This?

684
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,250
This?

685
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:19,830
Where did she say that from?

686
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,570
Where did she say that from?

687
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,390
She opened a path.

688
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,010
Oh, did she?

689
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,110
I did miss it then.

690
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,010
Oh, right here?

691
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,890
Oh, the thing that's shining really bright.

692
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,230
Oh, thank you, guys.

693
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:43,270
Aha!

694
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:44,730
Thank you, thank you.

695
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:47,030
Kochi?

696
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,170
Kochi.

697
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,790
I don't like it.

698
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,130
I don't want to trust her.

699
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,190
I don't trust if Shu says Kochi, but I don't trust if you say Kochi.

700
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,490
Thank you!

701
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:01,810
Thank you!

702
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,030
Oh!

703
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:04,750
Oh!

704
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:13,130
Thank you so much for the 50 gifts and thank you so much!

705
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,690
Thank you!

706
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:15,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

707
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,770
Oh, the game just saved.

708
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:20,870
Okay, I feel better now.

709
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,580
Like, I feel better, but I don't feel better, you know what I mean?

710
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,340
Like, I feel better because I... if I die...

711
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,640
Oh, it's that thing again.

712
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:44,880
Oh, gosh.

713
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,240
That's the thing.

714
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,940
I don't feel better at all.

715
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,380
Never mind.

716
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:54,840
I lied.

717
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,040
Ouch!

718
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,240
Ouch!

719
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:02,380
Ouch!

720
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Oh,

721
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,300
I stunned him, though.

722
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:07,760
Kind of?

723
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,080
Yeah!

724
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,060
Get his ass!

725
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:13,300
Oh.

726
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,100
I'm out of stamina.

727
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Please.

728
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,440
Restore.

729
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:17,780
Restore.

730
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,280
Restore.

731
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,020
I'm stuck.

732
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:24,960
I'm stuck.

733
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,200
Trying to restore stamina?

734
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,340
Okay.

735
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:32,640
Die!

736
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,140
Oh, I got him!

737
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,140
Yeah!

738
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,480
First try!

739
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:42,880
No!

740
00:52:44,900 --> 00:53:26,980
the heck he was there I think honestly I'm not gonna lie maybe because I'm less afraid of him I I'm less scared of him I can fight him more easily than the other than the mannequin ladies a particularly suspicious monster that walks on all fours the greedily staring odd his eyes the greasy palms the disgusting way acts all chummy with me all of it is completely repulsive what's more it never even bothers with guys typical those things look like the liquors from resident evil yeah i see it

741
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:43,920
is this otaku monster the greedily staring eyes and the greasy palms oh no my palms are sweaty right now is it me am i the monster

742
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,100
Uh-oh.

743
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,480
I forgot about this.

744
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,680
A monster in the form of a Miko or shrine maiden.

745
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,680
It sounds just like Sakuko.

746
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,360
It swings around a spiked mace and chain.

747
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,320
With each swing, the crisp chime of a bell rings out.

748
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,760
Is this actually Sakuko?

749
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,040
Or is this just a monster pretending to be her?

750
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:07,700
Oh.

751
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:08,700
Okay.

752
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:09,920
We're back in.

753
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,920
I wish the game would save again so I don't have to fight him again.

754
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,480
I hear more.

755
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,460
I can't tell if it's squelching from the...

756
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,260
Or if it's like a monster, you know?

757
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,760
Wait, I'm gonna...

758
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,300
Wow, that didn't do like anything.

759
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,720
Anything in there?

760
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,100
No?

761
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,180
Nothing?

762
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:33,500
Okay.

763
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,720
Yeah, it still owes me 500 yen.

764
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,400
So true!

765
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,280
I was a good friend!

766
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,780
Wait, can I go inside this house?

767
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,740
That'd be kind of crazy if I could.

768
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,280
And by crazy means I don't want to.

769
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,200
By crazy I mean...

770
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,200
Don't make me do that.

771
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:58,480
Uh-oh.

772
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,380
Bad music?

773
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,380
Bad music?

774
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,180
Bad music?

775
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:02,560
Bad music?

776
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,480
Bad music?

777
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,580
Where is it coming from?

778
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,220
I can't tell what is meat sound and what is...

779
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:12,560
Ah!

780
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:16,590
Ah!

781
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,770
Get away from me!

782
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,550
Where did you come from?!

783
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,690
Oh, shoot.

784
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:29,550
Whoa.

785
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:31,790
Oopsie.

786
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:33,130
Oh, I got it, though.

787
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,200
Where did she come from?

788
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,740
Okay, nothing over here.

789
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,340
I guess I do have to go up there.

790
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,120
Let's check over here real quick.

791
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,600
Where did she come from?

792
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,260
Oh, wait.

793
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,400
No!

794
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,400
No, don't make me go in!

795
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,490
Okay, we'll stick with...

796
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,750
Well...

797
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,170
I guess we're okay with this for now.

798
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:12,090
Hold on.

799
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:12,930
Up here?

800
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:14,230
There was really nothing?

801
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,490
It just spawned a lady.

802
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,260
I guess.

803
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,420
Nothing over here?

804
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,300
Oh, just kidding.

805
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,920
An antique comb?

806
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,460
Can I offer that?

807
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,460
Is that like an offering?

808
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:34,740
Hmm.

809
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,980
I wish there was a save point before going into this house.

810
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Oh, no.

811
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,490
It feels too much like going into a haunted house, you know?

812
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:07,630
Considering they don't really drop anything, the enemy placement level design seems to really encourage confrontation over avoidance.

813
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:08,710
That's...

814
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:09,930
Yeah, I feel like that, too.

815
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,250
Oh.

816
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:12,910
Oh my gosh.

817
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,070
Don't make me go in there.

818
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,840
Like, there's been times I've been able to avoid, obviously.

819
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,780
But most of the time, I'm having to fight them.

820
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,480
It does auto-save.

821
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,560
And here it does.

822
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,360
I'm trusting you.

823
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,740
What am I doing?

824
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,740
What am I doing?

825
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:38,740
Ah!

826
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,460
It did not auto-save.

827
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,340
Face your fears.

828
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,260
Ah!

829
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,860
Go through the house.

830
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:24,900
it did save though it did save sorry you could see my mouse shouldn't going into a haunted house be super comfy for you though not all ghosts are nice to other ghosts submitting a noise complaint against the hills to the local HOA they're not quiet enough these hills these hills are loud since we're indoors i'm gonna use my My seku.

831
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,200
Because I want to kill quickly.

832
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,020
It's gotten into the house.

833
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:32,740
What do you...

834
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,630
What do you...

835
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,080
What... What is it?

836
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,250
What is it?

837
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,620
What is it?

838
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,020
What is it?

839
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:52,450
What is it?

840
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:57,690
He went that way.

841
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,230
Ouch, out of the way.

842
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,570
Oh, yes, it's dead.

843
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,400
The music, though, kills me when it...

844
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't say that.

845
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,180
A kitchen knife!

846
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,960
It's frail, so I'll need to handle it with care.

847
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,740
A knife, a light knife for slicing meat and fish that's easy to use.

848
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,550
Should I replace the sickle?

849
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,250
Most damage.

850
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:55,690
Yeah?

851
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,840
Lost for good.

852
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,960
So sad.

853
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:03,740
Chocolate.

854
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,800
What does the chocolate do?

855
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,280
Equipment.

856
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:09,760
There we go.

857
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,080
Bye-bye.

858
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,720
I was like, um, items.

859
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,180
Slightly restores current max sanity.

860
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,160
Insanity will not be consumed.

861
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,340
I always forget about focus stuff, you guys.

862
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:18,980
I'm sorry.

863
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,720
I forget about it.

864
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,500
Yields a great deal of faith when enshrined.

865
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,120
skull.

866
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,920
There's a lot of health items, but at the same time there's three things you have to worry about.

867
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:38,720
You have to worry about your stamina, your sanity, and your health.

868
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:45,560
So, you know, I get chocolate, but I'm like, oh, my sanity is...

869
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,540
Like, I wish it was something for health health instead.

870
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,740
Where did that...

871
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,720
Where did that... Where did that come from anyway, that lady?

872
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:12,400
in here maybe gosh I'm so scared bandage huge step back girls this calls for a real show of man the hot blooded baseball samurai steps up to the plate

873
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:28,880
I got it okay okay Me with my baseball bat.

874
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,920
I don't want to turn that off because I'm afraid of it triggering something, you know?

875
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,500
Like a creature being like, hey, you turned off my favorite station.

876
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,840
Bouga, bouga, bouga, bouga, bouga, bouga, bouga, bouga.

877
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,600
Ramanay, hold on, let me also check that.

878
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,040
Sorry.

879
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,620
I'm not stalling.

880
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,080
See, so much stuff for sanity.

881
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,320
She's cosplaying as a Yandere.

882
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,700
This is what Yandere simulator could never be.

883
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,320
it okay

884
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:46,840
who who was that all right go through the house i'm going i'm going okay i think maybe if i get out well actually i guess it depends where i get out there's a save point

885
01:02:52,700 --> 01:03:02,500
this place is humongous among us wait is that blood leading into that room oh are there somebody's pants?

886
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,100
Uh-oh, somebody... It's the mannequin.

887
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,440
Okay, that way is blocked, so we have to go through there, okay.

888
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,780
That definitely looked like a letter I could read.

889
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:16,380
More higashi.

890
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:23,000
Okay, good, we're gonna have a lot to... to pray about.

891
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,300
I sure have a lot to pray about here!

892
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,760
Oh, man.

893
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:36,720
Yeah, we have to go through the blood door, which is never a good idea.

894
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,040
I'm looking at the photos on the, like, the pictures and stuff.

895
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,580
It's kind of fun.

896
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,600
What kind of house is this?

897
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,680
It seems like...

898
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,500
Like, I'm a little confused.

899
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,520
No, I don't.

900
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,840
Okay, before I go in, guys, I have to go to the little ghosties room.

901
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:12,400

902
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:20,900

903
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,640
End combat sequence.

904
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,140
Oh, that's sick.

905
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,020
Is it all the people that were living here?

906
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,940
It looks like it'll throw up.

907
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,340
Yep, I hauled it.

908
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:44,700
Okay.

909
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:50,520
Can I even kill this thing?

910
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,780
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

911
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,360
You can?

912
01:06:59,560 --> 01:06:59,780
Okay.

913
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,340
Do I want to or do I want to just leave?

914
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,220
I'm just gonna leave.

915
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,650
I think it's better so I don't waste my knife.

916
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,500
I don't want to waste my knife, you know?

917
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:27,580
Rinko?

918
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,000
I'm right here!

919
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:43,960

922
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:22,800
That's so freaky.

923
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,380
Okay, there is a save right ahead.

924
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:28,820
Ish.

925
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,740
Ew, ew, ew, ew.

926
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,210
I hear, like, things walking all over.

927
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,090
Oh, my gosh.

928
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:40,810
I'm paranoid.

929
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,630
I'm hella paranoid right now.

930
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:43,890
Wait.

931
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,570
Can I go that way even?

932
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,900
Oh, I think I can.

933
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,040
Sorry, I keep double checking.

934
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,340
Okay, I want to go save real quick.

935
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:55,760
I want to go save.

936
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,580
I want to go save.

937
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:02,800
I think it'll let me.

938
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:03,600
Yes.

939
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,360
Yippee!

940
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,400
Safety!

941
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:16,410
Okay.

942
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:20,090
Let's offer the chocolate.

943
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,490
I mean, I could honestly offer the chocolate.

944
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,590
The comb.

945
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,550
We'll do like two of the Higashi.

946
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:29,270
We'll do one chocolate.

947
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,010
What's the Yohan give me?

948
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:31,310
Health.

949
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,310
We won't offer that.

950
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,710
Arade, hot health.

951
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:43,010
and we'll do like a ramen two ramen yeah two ramen

952
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:51,130
what should we do guys wait do we draw umamori or do we pray

953
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,870
I have one emma

954
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:07,340
save for the umamori slots what umamori do I even I think I have wait

955
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,200
Yeah, I have one space for...

956
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,460
I have only space for one Omamori right now.

957
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:24,820
Yeah, yeah.

958
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:25,480
Oh, that's true.

959
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,000
I think I got stamina before.

960
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,320
That's why it's 800 now.

961
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,500
Health, sanity.

962
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,800
I still don't understand the sanity mechanic.

963
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,300
I think I'm stupid.

964
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:44,940
Oh.

965
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,260
I'll think about it.

966
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,600
Let me save it.

967
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,160
Let me save.

968
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,780
Whoa, did you see my playtime?

969
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,640
It was very spooky.

970
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,460
Am I going this way, actually?

971
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,020
Wait a second.

972
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,940
No, let's turn around and go try the other way real quick.

973
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,960
Oh, my moori, that turns sanity into HP?

974
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,740
Wait, that sounds...

975
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,000
What the?

976
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,840
I locked onto something.

977
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:21,480
I thought I did.

978
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,560
Maybe I saw something drop.

979
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,400
Okay, anyway.

980
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,720
I don't know if I can go this way, but I still want to check.

981
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:36,200
Okay.

982
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:37,880
Wait.

983
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,520
Oh, yes, we can!

984
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:39,820
Okay.

985
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,540
I don't know where we're going.

986
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,360
I don't know where my quote-unquote friends are.

987
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,800
Also, this city is so whack.

988
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,000
There's loot on the other side?

989
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,580
Yeah, I do have Omamori equipped.

990
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:55,960
I do.

991
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,240
I have uh...

992
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,320
This one increases max stamina.

993
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,880
Wait, what's this hand mirror though?

994
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:08,420
When taking fatal damage from normal attacks, this mirror will break instead.

995
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,900
Health, sanity, and stamina will be fully restored.

996
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,240
Whoa!

997
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,120
Wait, I kind of want to save up...

998
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,200
For a boss.

999
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,560
Wait, that's crazy!

1000
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:27,810
Yeah.

1001
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:31,930
It's okay, I think we can.

1002
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:43,850
can keep going or i think this is the way i need to go check for loot nothing stingy stingy people of this town

1003
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:58,090
oh shit okay oh is there two oh my god oh my god i'm stuck i'm stuck i'm stuck

1004
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,010
It's scripted!

1005
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,100
Oh, I'm dead.

1006
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,030
I got stuck on...

1007
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,450
Oh, I didn't realize that the path closed.

1008
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:12,630
Ah!

1009
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:16,730
Holy cow.

1010
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:19,930
Well, let's check down here, then.

1011
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:26,930
Scripted, scripted.

1012
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:28,690
Yeah, let's see.

1013
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:31,970
It seems like this is a dead end, so...

1014
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,150
Wait, I'm not sure.

1015
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:40,290
It seems it's very spooky, that's what it is.

1016
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:41,470
Wait, where the hell?

1017
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:42,770
Where am I going?

1018
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,170
Map too big.

1019
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,870
That's not a box I can open.

1020
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,910
Wait, this is where I'm supposed to go!

1021
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,870
Oh my gosh.

1022
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:57,910
Okay, good thing we died then.

1023
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,570
Okay, good thing we died then.

1024
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:02,470
I don't know.

1025
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:20,850
Oh my god.

1026
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,490
Oh, okay.

1027
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,090
Crazy music for just meeting up with my friends.

1028
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:37,230
Oh my gosh.

1029
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:39,770
Wait, this is where we started the game.

1030
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:42,890
Like, or rather, like, when we encountered our first enemy.

1031
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,000
Vinko is kind of the worst.

1032
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,050
Okay.

1033
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:01,830
I hear something, though.

1034
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,950
I hear...

1035
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,030
What's my...

1036
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:07,450
Okay.

1037
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:17,720
I guess there probably would have been some sick loot the other direction, but...

1038
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,800
It kind of punished me for exploring.

1039
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,880
boring, so...

1040
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,920
Oh, it's the... it's the...

1041
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,580
It's the Otaku!

1042
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:26,700
Otaku!

1043
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,340
Hey, Otaku!

1044
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,040
Otaku touchy!

1045
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,460
Not touchy, no, only one, please.

1046
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,180
It's fine, we're chill.

1047
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,860
We're cool like that.

1048
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:50,460
Me and this guy.

1049
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,080
Okay.

1050
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:17,680
the mountain behind every Sugaoka middle school so we're we're back to trying to go to here okay but what path with what area if meeting your friends triggers music by Akira Yamaoka I'd start reconsidering your friendships I see it an otaku at the bottom right

1051
01:16:22,420 --> 01:17:01,820
I feel like your character had to be willfully ignorant of how awful she was to write the entries we read at the beginning it's not like she tries to hide it wait oh what wrinkle maybe I mean it could be that you know people kind of I don't want to say their personalities change but like in situations like this people are going to act different oh wait this all just opened up oh my gosh okay I was like,

1052
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:02,860
wait, do I need to go around?

1053
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,900
But nope, I definitely need to go towards this filler.

1054
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,620
I was like, do I need to go that way or go around?

1055
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,280
We're fine.

1056
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:13,720
It's chill.

1057
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:14,700
Yeah, it's fine.

1058
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:15,020
We're chill.

1059
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,300
Silent Hill Pro Tag.

1060
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:19,480
No worries.

1062
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:21,420
Oh, wow.

1063
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,040
Back to school.

1064
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,220
Yeah, that sucks.

1065
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,700
I didn't even do my homework.

1066
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,400
Thank you, delinquent.

1067
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:30,240
Oh.

1068
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,540
Well, this guy...

1069
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,960
We fought him before in an alleyway.

1070
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,540
I guess we can, uh...

1071
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,180
Do it again.

1072
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,780
Wrinkle character details.

1073
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:48,460
Enjoys actively being the most obviously aggressive level of passively aggressive that's humanly impossible.

1074
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,480
Okay, here I go.

1075
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,560
I'm being brave.

1076
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,360
Oh.

1077
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:57,520
Okay.

1078
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,260
Okay!

1079
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,160
Yeah!

1080
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,480
Fear me!

1081
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,400
Fear me!

1082
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:17,700
I have a feeling he's gonna, like, jump down at me, though.

1083
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:22,460
Like, right in this area he's gonna ambush me.

1084
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,200
Look, they left the dog bowl for him and everything.

1085
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,560
Okay.

1086
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,360
I was wrong.

1087
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,440
I love being wrong.

1088
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:47,300
I like don't trust open areas as much as I don't trust closed areas, you know.

1089
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,480
You recognize the kindred soul.

1090
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,300
Okay.

1091
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,040
His baby.

1092
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:02,660
Throw up baby.

1093
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,180
Dried carcass.

1094
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,160
Wait, we can offer this, right?

1095
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,520
Does each monster have its own music?

1096
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:11,820
Noticing this now.

1097
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:13,380
Sometimes the music sounds different.

1098
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,740
Baby man, baby man.

1099
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,340
Wait!

1100
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,920
Oh my gosh!

1101
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,140
Wait, why are you on fire now?

1102
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,120
Why are you on fire?

1103
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:42,880
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1104
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,160
Ooh, got his ass.

1105
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,490
Men on fire.

1106
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,950
Go away, baby.

1107
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:02,730
Go away.

1108
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:03,970
Thank you.

1109
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:05,610
My knife, though.

1110
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:09,770
I wonder if I can take this guy out with a bat.

1111
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:20,360
Did you hear the physical release for this game's OSD got canceled?

1112
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,680
Wait, why?

1113
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:25,420
Why, though?

1114
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,720
You could probably just run past him.

1115
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,480
I guess that's true.

1116
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:32,520
Okay.

1117
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,700
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1118
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,860
He'll leave me alone and then I'll be able to save.

1119
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,120
Right?

1120
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,000
Yeah.

1121
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,500
Easy peasy.

1122
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:58,600
Whoa!

1123
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,480
Wait, we can actually almost...

1124
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,020
We're 500 away from the increased Omamori.

1125
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,800
I don't know what to do yet.

1126
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,360
I don't know.

1127
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:09,960
I don't know.

1128
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,700
I don't know if I want to go with, like, my own stats or what, you know?

1129
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,760
Are you still on your first run?

1130
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,380
Yeah, yeah, I am.

1131
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:21,440
I am.

1132
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,440
I'm pretty slow at this game, I'm not gonna lie.

1133
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:30,080
I've been definitely taking my sweet, sweet time, because I'm scared.

1134
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,420
Omamori are OP.

1135
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:40,230
Okay.

1136
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,670
Ducky, thank you so much for the gift, dead!

1137
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:43,730
I did save, right?

1138
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:44,290
I think I did.

1139
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:44,690
Okay.

1140
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:48,070
Anyways, we're in the mountains.

1141
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,670
Whoa!

1142
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,350
What is that?

1143
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,050
Ebisugaoka?

1144
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,470
I think

1145
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:06,140
that was usually pretty good with horror.

1146
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,900
I'm curious what's so spooky about this game.

1147
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,820
Actually, I'm not good with horror at all.

1148
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,620
I'm not good with horror.

1149
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,100
At all, actually.

1150
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,860
If it comes off that way, maybe I'm doing a good job.

1151
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:21,520
Yes.

1152
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,900
Pretending to be brave.

1153
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,220
Wait, can I go in here?

1154
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,900
I don't want to, but I'm asking for a friend.

1155
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,340
Okay, good.

1156
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,380
I think it's really...

1157
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,280
The combat is a little difficult for me.

1158
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,780
That's like something I'm not used to.

1159
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,880
And then also...

1160
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:51,300
Also...

1161
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,600
The tense atmosphere.

1162
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,320
Oh, that's a flag.

1163
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:04,480
But I love horror games.

1164
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,560
And I love horror in general, so...

1165
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:14,060
Because maybe I love horror games so much, it seems like I'm okay with them.

1166
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,380
I'm going to try the other direction.

1167
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:17,240
I don't know why.

1168
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,200
You didn't play enough Souls games to be used to the combat?

1169
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,300
I've played zero Souls games, so...

1170
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:24,940
Yeah.

1171
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,420
I think that's not enough games.

1172
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:28,540
Yeah.

1173
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,560
I think so.

1174
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,380
I think that's not a lot of Souls games.

1175
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,080
But I'm doing my best.

1176
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:50,400
I wouldn't say I'm getting used to it per se, but I'm attempting.

1177
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,740
There is an attempt.

1178
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,820
Oh, I thought that was a metal pipe.

1179
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,400
What's the point of exploration if you're not gonna give me anything?

1180
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,230
But I love the atmosphere.

1181
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:19,450
Very much.

1182
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:23,070
If I'm...

1183
01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:26,710
Even if I'm not so keen on the gameplay.

1184
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:28,310
Oh, okay, never mind.

1185
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:29,910
What?

1186
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:30,510
What?

1187
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,790
What?

1188
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:31,250
Where?

1189
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,190
Behind me?

1190
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:33,190
Where did you come from?

1191
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:34,370
Where did you come from?

1192
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,310
Two hits?

1193
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:43,910
That's it!

1194
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:46,030
Oh my gosh, the knife is amazing.

1195
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,160
Ah, okay, so I do have to go the other way.

1196
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,280
Oh, I got some peels.

1197
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:28,820
the souls guy the timing and movement of this combat makes me weep you're doing well i love it when people that are bad with horror games love playing them yeah well for a long time i would only i watched like i mean there are some youtubers and streamers that i watch that exclusively play horror games and i watch those like almost if not daily and for a long time even before i was a streamer i would watch them like daily and stuff so

1198
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,040
Uh...

1199
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:35,500
You know.

1200
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:45,860
But even still, it's different than me playing them, because I can watch and be like, I'm looking away.

1201
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,720
Here, I can't do that, which is so sad.

1202
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:50,700
That's from the Obon Festival.

1203
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,200
Wait, did I say it's a bit early?

1204
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,840
Wait, Obon!

1205
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,760
That's like my thing.

1206
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:04,510
Oh yeah, we forgot to look at the baby.

1207
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,960
Didn't Minto ever play The Bunker from Amnesia Series.

1208
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,020
No, those games stress me out.

1209
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,160
A face.

1210
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:17,920
Two faces.

1211
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:18,620
Three faces.

1212
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:19,180
Four.

1213
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:20,940
Put in the Dr. Seuss.

1214
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:29,640
A monster with a thronging mass of faces.

1215
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:33,640
I'm not familiar with any of the faces, yet they seem to know me.

1216
01:26:33,960 --> 01:27:24,020
It spouts repulsive things one after the other, violating the peace quiet wherever it goes okay wait i said it updated but i don't know what updated actually maybe characters information oh the lantern evil boarding lantern a type of revolving lantern that has a long history in ebisugaoka the picture silhouette rotates inside the can't the can't the lantern due to the air current that the candle makes oh normally revolving lanterns are for entertainment but the ones in ebisugaoka were specifically used to ward off evil in ebisugaoka there is a custom where women in unlucky ages hang it on the front door during obon what is oh unlucky age is like if i guess you're 44 or something

1217
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:39,270
originally actually i wanted my 3d live to not be well it wasn't originally going to be a birthday thing originally was going to be wearing oboe.

1218
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,730
Good thing I didn't mention oboe in at all.

1219
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:44,390
Good thing I forgot.

1220
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:50,410
Good thing it's not because it had to get pushed.

1221
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:55,190
Good thing it's because I didn't remember.

1222
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:02,840
Big doors.

1223
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:06,920
So an old lady lives here?

1224
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:10,660
All right one second.

1225
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,460
I'm gonna go save real quick since We're right by it.

1226
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:20,630
No, no.

1227
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:21,450
Leave me alone.

1228
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:23,990
Leave me alone.

1229
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,850
And then I also want to...

1230
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:29,610
Maybe...

1231
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,130
What do I have?

1232
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,850
We have three Higashi.

1233
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:40,490
Nice.

1234
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:42,750
Yeah, no music.

1235
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,930
You're not correct.

1236
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:44,610
You're inaccurate.

1237
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:46,210
I'm in no trouble.

1238
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:49,010
Leave me alone.

1239
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,390
Alright.

1240
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:53,590
Okie dokie.

1241
01:28:54,110 --> 01:29:12,470
It would be interesting if you could enter all the houses, but also it would be terrifying, and I Would not do it because I'm a baby What's my The stamina is not looking so great on our knife you guys.

1242
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:39,930
I'm gonna switch to the bat for now If we encounter a big boy, I'll switch to the knife, but For anything that's not a big boy, I think I gotta be little more um oh my he scares me every time i gotta be a little more stingy oh we're right here though wow a locked door is always the most comforting thing in a silent you're right

1243
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:49,350
what is happening why

1244
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:55,110
What?

1245
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:56,230
What about me?

1246
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:57,870
Huh?

1247
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,480
I'm a ghost?

1248
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:37,600
Whoa.

1249
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,460
They said this was like a new fancy in middle school, right?

1250
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:54,340
at all right it should be nice and modern and easy on the eyes right should

1251
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:40,070
be nothing spooky scary about it at all it's more space wars you gotta be kidding me not to brag but we've taken down the enemy's mothership the giant UFO on many occasions however each time that happened the galactic imperium would deploy more and more troops from their whole planet as we grew older we were able to have a better understanding of heroes by watching television and i think we came up with this with some elaborate backstories for the enemy leaders by this time it was the only it was a world that only shu and i knew not to brag but um my invisible demons yeah i beat them up

1252
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:45,570
I'm pretty tough when I'm fighting, you know.

1253
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:49,890
My inner demons and all.

1254
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:55,310
Wait.

1255
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,580
I definitely see something on top of this.

1256
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,870
But I can't tell if it's moving or not.

1257
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,690
I definitely see something on top of that, though.

1258
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:14,670
Maybe I'll go check it out still.

1259
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:15,650
Oh, my gosh.

1260
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:16,570
One sec.

1261
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:17,150
Oh, just kidding.

1262
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:18,330
Okay.

1263
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:34,830
Why don't you just jump it?

1264
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:36,310
It's not even that tall.

1265
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:44,170
OG Silent Hill does have a UFO ending, so this space door stuff could be kept on the way to school.

1266
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:44,910
The little spare...

1267
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:46,050
Oh, I couldn't read it.

1268
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,670
I couldn't read the achievement fast enough.

1269
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:49,130
I'm sorry.

1270
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:51,150
Something about a little sparrow.

1271
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:01,830
How have they been so fast if this is how he's been moving too?

1272
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:06,850
Same.

1273
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:09,750
Actually, Rinko's kind of relatable here.

1274
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:11,790
I got it.

1275
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:12,850
I'm tired, too.

1276
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:16,110
Please stay here.

1277
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:16,470
I'm going to stay here.

1278
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:16,770
I'm going to find the door.

1279
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:18,230
I got it.

1280
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:18,450
What?

1281
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:19,130
What?

1282
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:19,250
What?

1283
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:19,910
What's wrong?

1284
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:20,990
What's wrong?

1285
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,810
What's wrong?

1286
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:30,930
No!

1287
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:32,870
No!

1288
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:36,570
No!

1289
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:42,450
Wait, so if Hinako is dead, but she can still- No!

1290
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:43,130
No!

1291
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:45,670
Wait, so if Hinako is dead, but she can still- I don't care.

1292
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:48,290
No, please let me rest.

1293
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:53,560
Oh my god.

1294
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,960
You don't have to show up.

1295
01:33:55,980 --> 01:34:31,060
shut the door i should look for the keys to the bucket like i thought maybe she was like she's dead because she couldn't like but she's been responding to her and stuff so i'm kind of confused abysugaoka middle school this is oh wait uh abysugaoka used to be a lively town with an ample labor force for construction and coal mining when the school was built the town was always bustling and the school was full of students the students at the time studied how to further improve the students of our time now study so that we can leave to go to a bigger town when we're adults.

1296
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,000
Oh, yeah.

1297
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:38,600
It's like a problem now with all these small um, what's the word?

1298
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:40,420
Small cities and all.

1299
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:45,000
I have all the kids growing up and leaving to go to Tokyo and stuff.

1300
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:56,570
Did you guys hear that?

1301
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,720
Wait, is this the entrance?

1302
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:15,360
Do you guys hear that?

1303
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,320
Spooky.

1304
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,680
This was very quiet.

1305
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,180
Maybe the game is too low for it to pick up.

1306
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,200
Ah, I see, I see.

1307
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,820
Oh, okay, so that is the entrance.

1308
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:33,280
Okay, okay.

1309
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,260
Look at the little drawings are so cute.

1310
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,360
It wasn't breathing.

1311
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,380
It was like a...

1312
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,980
Oh, wait, there we go.

1313
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:00,250
Oh.

1314
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,410
I was like, wow, it's so bright!

1315
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:04,090
No, I'm scared.

1316
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:08,110
Actually, I don't like it.

1317
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:10,030
It's...

1318
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,430
I don't...

1319
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:14,550
When there's light, when there's darkness, I don't like any of it.

1320
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,150
Bold alert to real!

1321
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:20,150
What?

1322
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,750
Can I just leave?

1323
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,530
Okay, bye.

1324
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,830
Who needs a key?

1325
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,600
Why don't I just leave?

1326
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:39,540
Ah!

1327
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,640
It pays to explore.

1328
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,340
Oreg army of rumors.

1329
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:51,060
Next thing someone heard my prayers.

1330
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,720
To whichever god who answered them, thank you.

1331
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,220
It's the Oreg army killer.

1332
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:25,080
origami of grievances oh there's a custom that's said to get rid of your worries like magic you write grievances that you can't tell anyone on a piece of paper fold it into an origami fox and then throw it somewhere that no one else will find it if you happen to come across someone else's origami of grievances you can put it to rest by reading it no matter what's written on it you have to keep the information to yourself and not tell a single soul

1333
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:33,000
that's been in this town for ages, but it was particularly popular with middle schoolers.

1334
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:41,720
Some kids would indirectly bully others by writing gossip about the person they hated and making sure to put it in a place they would see it.

1335
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,700
I personally don't like to write bad things about people or read them for that matter.

1336
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:55,280
They say that you can put those complaints to rest by reading them, so I make the effort to read them out, but to be honest, I'd rather not pick them up when I see them.

1337
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,000
Wait, uh...

1338
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,120
Is it like a collectible?

1339
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,680
A document?

1340
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,060
What's it say?

1341
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,340
Gutsikuyo is an ancient practice within Abisugaoka.

1342
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:18,220
First one writes the grievances, they hold inside their heart upon the sheet of paper, then they make the prayer into the foxes.

1343
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,700
If we're leaving the paper in a place, no one will find it.

1344
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:24,200
Oh, I guess that's what it wrote, what they wrote.

1345
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:24,800
Interesting.

1346
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:26,940
Oh!

1347
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:47,350
Nice.

1348
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:54,730
Nanashi needs to confront the bad origami writers.

1349
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,130
I still have faith.

1350
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,730
I'm still thinking of what to do.

1351
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:07,230
Okay, we'll just leave it as we have it.

1352
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:10,110
What's over here though?

1353
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:15,410
So much to explore.

1354
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:17,270
I hate that.

1355
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:19,710
I don't like that at all.

1356
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:20,890
Freaks me out!

1357
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:21,790
What's that?

1358
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:22,130
Yeah!

1359
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:24,950
For me to sell.

1360
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:28,570
Why would they put that there?

1361
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:30,850
For me.

1362
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:32,910
Hi Minto and chat.

1363
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:34,210
Hi Rees!

1364
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:38,570
I like how the ghost emoji kind of blends into the super chat color.

1365
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:42,170
Yay!

1366
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:48,030
Offer, offer, offer, take this dry chicken!

1367
01:39:52,270 --> 01:40:03,810
We could totally offer like one thing, like a chocolate, and hit the 1500 we need for the increased Omamori slots.

1368
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:08,510
But at the same time...

1369
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,580
What Omamori do I have?

1370
01:40:19,870 --> 01:40:49,490
so right now i have increased oops we have the increased stamina i could do increase max health greatly decrease focus charging time that might encourage me to use it more maybe decrease enemy line of sight and then greatly decrease the damage taken while dodging Hawk is OP.

1371
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,290
I could get it and try it.

1372
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:54,290
Let's try it.

1373
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:56,470
Let's do it.

1374
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:00,290
Why not?

1375
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,380
Oh, your prayers were heard.

1376
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,080
You can now equip more Omamori.

1377
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:14,960
3,000!

1378
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,020
Oh, yeah.

1379
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,900
I just have to remember to do the focus.

1380
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,060
Holy, it's so fast!

1381
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:33,580
Wait.

1382
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:46,360
Oh my gosh, that actually makes a significant difference.

1383
01:41:54,690 --> 01:41:55,710
Focus, Vittobar.

1384
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:57,670
I am, I am!

1385
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:00,170
Wait, who was I...

1386
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:02,110
Oh, I was like, who was I going to attack?

1387
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:04,510
It's because I was focusing.

1388
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,270
is built on stilts.

1389
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:17,390
Anything over here?

1390
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,090
No.

1391
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:31,070
Wow, wee.

1392
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:34,610
That's what I was hearing.

1393
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:35,670
You guys hear it now?

1394
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:37,910
The rattling of the window?

1395
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,190
Okay, I guess we can't just leave.

1396
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:44,470
That really sucks, but...

1397
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:45,950
Okay, wait.

1398
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:48,150
Can you guys remind me how to use the...

1399
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:49,510
Wait, I can just read.

1400
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:51,090
I can read.

1401
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:52,290
Wait, where's the journal?

1402
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:53,130
There we go.

1403
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:54,810
I can read tutorials.

1404
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:59,010
I can read, I can read.

1405
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:03,350
What did I miss about?

1406
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:04,350
Oh, examining.

1407
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:14,870
Health, stamina, sanity, dodging, fleeing.

1408
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:18,690
Focus.

1409
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:21,230
Once your focus gauge is full, use RB.

1410
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:24,710
Okay.

1411
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:29,830
She can read!

1412
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:30,890
She can read!

1413
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:35,610
She's not just blindly trusting chat.

1414
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:41,750
She's figuring out the answers all on her own!

1415
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,130
Wait, okay.

1416
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:44,930
I got the equipment.

1417
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:45,410
Okay.

1418
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:46,350
Cool.

1419
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:51,950
I still don't like it.

1420
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:53,850
I still don't like it.

1421
01:43:56,430 --> 01:44:00,510
But a ghost's gotta do, but a ghost's gotta do.

1422
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:05,150
Oh, oh, wow, there's so much...

1423
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:10,430
Wow, this map in particular is looking so classic Silent Hill.

1424
01:44:12,110 --> 01:44:24,630
Like, this is what I remember maps looking like in Silent Hill, where it's like a bunch of doors, and they're gonna be like scribbled out, kind of like the ones on the left.

1425
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,930
You have entered the dreaded school section.

1426
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,710
Wait, is that...

1427
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:33,090
Do people not like this section?

1428
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:34,130
Why?

1429
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:35,330
Oh gosh, I can't read.

1430
01:44:36,190 --> 01:44:36,890
What's it say?

1431
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:39,310
I can't read kanji.

1432
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:40,930
Human night.

1433
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:42,930
No good.

1434
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,330
It won't budge.

1435
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,420
It's fine, just a little spooky.

1436
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:54,260
It's a fun section.

1437
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:55,020
Oh, okay, cool.

1438
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:55,660
I like fun.

1439
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,100
Okay.

1440
01:44:59,120 --> 01:44:59,740
or something.

1441
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:01,180
Radio static?

1442
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:06,170
All the shoes.

1443
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:06,950
Oh!

1444
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:08,470
Wait, what's going on in here?

1445
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:19,080
I could replace my other steel bat.

1446
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:22,000
Be honest with me, guys.

1447
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,580
How good is the bat?

1448
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:25,800
Or steel pipe I meant, but how good is the bat?

1449
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,940
Be honest with me.

1450
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:37,480
Teacher journal, the vice principal is so paranoid about his keys that he always takes them with him whenever he leaves.

1451
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:40,400
So it's kind of ironic that he lost the keys to the stairwell.

1452
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,320
He's looking for them frantically like a madman.

1453
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,020
He had the nerve to ask me to help him find them.

1454
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:48,700
But I'm the one who needs help with this pile of paperwork I have.

1455
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:56,020
I love how Bat is great and Bat is meh.

1456
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,280
Write two comments right next to each other.

1457
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:03,080
Bat is stronger, pipe is faster.

1458
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:04,760
Okay, okay, okay.

1459
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:11,260
You need a key for the key box.

1460
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:14,060
Oh, to all facility on patrol duty.

1461
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:18,400
To prevent students from going to the second floor, please ensure the corridor is locked at the end of the day.

1462
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:20,800
On patrol this week, Vice Principal Matsu.

1463
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:27,740
Okay, so we have probably like a puzzly type thing going on here.

1464
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,820
Look at all these shoes.

1465
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:30,420
Yohan.

1466
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:39,730
It's stuck.

1467
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:40,810
Okay.

1468
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:42,310
Duality of chat.

1469
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:43,050
I know.

1470
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:46,890
This is how you know you'll never ever be able to please everybody.

1471
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:47,350
You know?

1472
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:53,030
Because you can ask a simple question as, you know, what's the bat like?

1473
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:54,890
And they'll be like, it's great.

1474
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:56,070
Or, it's meh.

1475
01:46:56,830 --> 01:47:00,330
And then you'll get a real answer, like someone saying, the bat is stronger.

1476
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:02,710
But, oh my gosh, Miffy!

1477
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:05,290
It's not Miffy.

1478
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:07,130
But the pipe is faster.

1479
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:19,510
To all students The game known as The Fox's Sacrifice is here by Band Partaking in this recent fad is Forbidden.

1480
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:23,130
Oh gosh, the kids are on TikTok and doing TikTok trends.

1481
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:28,330
Any students caught playing will Have their parents or guardians notified and be Severely punished.

1482
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:38,470
Fad does similar Damage is pipe but has less durability.

1483
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:46,370
Okay, I'm not stalling Goal.

1484
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:47,470
over there or anything?

1485
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:50,950
I'm not stalling or anything.

1486
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,290
I'm not stalling going over there or anything.

1487
01:47:55,450 --> 01:47:57,130
Wait, what's in this big room?

1488
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,130
What is this?

1489
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:05,940
I'm not...

1490
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:08,040
Oh, wait, this is the door that we need to unlock.

1491
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,440
We need to get the key.

1492
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,600
This is like when they banned Beyblaze in school.

1493
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:23,260
Yeah.

1494
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:25,640
How about school?

1495
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:28,860
Schools probably have like Pokemon cards still banned.

1496
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,620
Oh!

1497
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:36,900
Oops.

1498
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:42,750
Why did the music get all bad?

1499
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:45,570
Oh, what's over here?

1500
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:46,010
Uh oh.

1501
01:48:46,130 --> 01:48:47,810
Wait, this is an area I haven't been to before.

1502
01:48:49,110 --> 01:48:49,530
Uh oh!

1503
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:50,510
Okay, freaky.

1504
01:48:52,310 --> 01:48:53,170
I'm brave.

1505
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:54,490
I'm being brave.

1506
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,480
Principal?

1507
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:02,700
Vice Principal?

1508
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,200
Looks like there's an item here, but I'm scared.

1509
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:14,670
Divine water.

1510
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:20,710
Okay.

1511
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:23,910
So we have four more.

1512
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:27,410
We have to find the Vice Principal for his key.

1513
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:29,370
Wait, is he actually, like, here?

1514
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:34,950
Sonna.

1515
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:36,510
Sonna.

1516
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:38,530
That guy is not actually around.

1517
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:40,790
Okay.

1518
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:50,460
It's gonna be a radio- That scared me!

1519
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,720
The little baby!

1520
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:57,200
There's gonna be another radio that tells me some wisdom or something.

1521
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:59,980
Also another window I can hop out of.

1522
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:03,400
School Founders An anecdote.

1523
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,540
Buy as much of that mountain's land as you can.

1524
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,860
Borrow money if you must, for it will surely bring you great wealth.

1525
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:13,680
after the country commenced their damn construction plan.

1526
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:17,380
And the mountain Mr. Yoneda had purchased was indeed a boom.

1527
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:21,800
He spent every last yen he earned on his hometown of Ebisugaoka.

1528
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:26,320
One result of his generosity was Ebisugaoka Middle School.

1529
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:35,380
Mr. Yoneda donated the Inari statue and housed it inside the small shrine seen on school grounds as his way of saying thanks to the fox that blessed him.

1530
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,180
Interesting, interesting.

1531
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:42,280
I like the little...

1532
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:46,440
It's definitely not Miffy, but it looks enough like Miffy that it makes me feel calm.

1533
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:48,700
I really love Miffy, you guys.

1534
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,460
Oh my gosh, the little baby scared me again.

1535
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,380
Oh, there's something nasty out there.

1536
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:04,940
You hear it?

1537
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:11,770
What is that?

1538
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,490
Wait, that's the big guy again!

1539
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:17,370
Okay, let's, uh...

1540
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:18,590
Uh, ignore that.

1541
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,220
Oh, the space invaders.

1542
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:29,120
Why does this, like, little baby look so old?

1543
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:36,510
Space wars, yeah.

1544
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:39,730
Am I at school?

1545
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:51,750
No, no, don't say that.

1546
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:53,070
No, it's scary.

1547
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:55,930
That's like the typical...

1548
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:58,150
Oh, God, that baby scared me again.

1549
01:51:59,030 --> 01:51:59,590
Holy...

1550
01:51:59,930 --> 01:52:02,730
Oh, that's like the- that's like what ghosts say!

1551
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:25,880
No room that opens.

1552
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:27,080
Hate.

1553
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:27,960
Hate.

1554
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:28,740
Hate.

1555
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,120
Gosh, this area is so spooky, isn't it?

1556
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:34,080
Let's take that.

1557
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:35,880
Bless, bless, bless.

1558
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,060
Oh, my health is okay for now, so.

1559
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:40,560
Uh...

1560
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,200
An unlocked room.

1561
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:45,680
Yada, yada!

1562
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,900
For a shade kit!

1563
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:48,880
Uh-oh.

1564
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,740
They give me one health item, it's okay.

1565
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,520
Give me more than one?

1566
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,240
Uh-oh.

1567
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,620
Uh-oh, for real.

1568
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:03,190
Don't give me more than one!

1569
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:11,680
Aoi Takashi.

1570
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:13,800
It's okay.

1571
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:18,080
It can't be 8008.

1572
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,600
there's only three.

1573
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,100
So now that is on...

1574
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:25,880
What?

1575
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,680
Am I trying to steal his clothes?

1576
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:31,920
Hmm.

1577
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:43,620
Why is the girl's room flickering?

1578
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:47,740
Okay.

1579
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,400
I'm guessing though...

1580
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:59,720
I heard something from in there.

1581
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,340
Freaky.

1582
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:02,600
Freaky, freaky, freaky!

1583
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:07,780
I don't like this sign.

1584
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,920
I'm guessing, but...

1585
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:17,820
This area is also weak because we can't get into the second...

1586
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,700
Oh, wait.

1587
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,780
I thought the second floor was, like, off-limits until we got the key.

1588
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:26,380
Oh.

1589
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:29,620
Yeah.

1590
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:31,000
I knew it.

1591
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:37,160
Alright, time to go into the girl's room.

1592
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,860
Oh, boys, close your eyes.

1593
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:47,280
Boys, no peeking.

1594
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,680
No peeking, no peeking.

1595
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,800
Don't open your eyes.

1596
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,280
Oh, it won't open without a key.

1597
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:01,520
Another key?

1598
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:07,800
Okay, well, I've gone many places now.

1599
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:18,410
The only thing I feel like I can find somehow is the code.

1600
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:21,910
You may open your eyes.

1601
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:27,480
Oh, wait.

1602
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:28,860
There's also over here.

1603
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:35,360
There's also out this window, which I definitely don't want to do.

1604
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:40,740
Let me go save.

1605
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,120
let me go save and then we'll go out the window

1606
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:58,750
because i don't i went mainly i want to save because we marked all this stuff down and i don't want to have to redo it all you know

1607
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:15,340
do you think my friends will um let me go inside the room wait yeah it's up here okay

1608
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:25,890
I try not to run because I'm like, oh, I want to save stamina in case like something jumps out at me.

1609
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:35,850
But I guess in this case, things have been decently quiet enough for me to feel like I can run for right now.

1610
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:38,190
Okay.

1611
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:40,010
I did try.

1612
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:41,150
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1613
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:44,310
Here we go!

1614
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:46,070
I don't think it takes stamina to run outside.

1615
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:46,910
Oh, wait, really?

1616
01:56:47,530 --> 01:56:49,410
It doesn't take stamina to run outside of combat?

1617
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:52,350
Oh, stamina only drains in combat.

1618
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:53,870
Oh!

1619
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:55,250
What?

1620
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:58,290
I was being careful this whole time with my stamina.

1621
01:56:58,650 --> 01:57:00,390
That's why I haven't been running at all.

1622
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:03,990
Oops!

1623
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,080
You think you'll notice me?

1624
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:26,380
Do I have to, like...

1625
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:27,360
This looks...

1626
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:27,660
Oh.

1627
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:31,700
He immediately noticed me?

1628
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,320
Wait, though.

1629
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:40,140
I wonder if I have to like run around him Okay

1630
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:50,190
If I die, I die Oh, I'm stuck What do I have to do this time?

1631
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:51,170
Let's see

1632
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:06,170
I'm exploring Against my Against my better judgment Is what I was going to say?

1633
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:14,540
The place is huge Yeah Come here.

1634
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:15,720
Come on.

1635
01:58:26,110 --> 01:58:26,550
Oh, shoot.

1636
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:35,690
Did I take her out?

1637
01:58:35,830 --> 01:58:36,410
Yeah, okay.

1638
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:45,630
Oh, my focus!

1639
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:47,190
You're right.

1640
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:48,390
Wait.

1641
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:49,590
Wait, is that the big baddie?

1642
01:58:49,770 --> 01:58:49,970
Oh.

1643
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:51,530
Come on, fine!

1644
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:52,010
Good.

1645
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:54,390
Wait.

1646
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:57,290
Where did I come from?

1647
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,070
Where have I?

1648
01:58:58,150 --> 01:58:58,590
Oh.

1649
01:58:59,330 --> 01:58:59,850
Uh.

1650
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:02,270
Eww!

1651
01:59:03,410 --> 01:59:05,570
Am I gonna hear them, I think?

1652
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:08,050
Like talking smack about me?

1653
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:16,110
Oh, it's...

1654
01:59:16,110 --> 01:59:16,630
Baby.

1655
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:25,120
I'm a little lost.

1656
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,320
Eww.

1657
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:35,420
Big batty in the bottom, right?

1658
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:43,890
Oh, okay, that goes around.

1659
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:45,410
Oh, the circles around.

1660
01:59:45,530 --> 02:00:18,960
interesting okay but is there anything out here i feel like i've covered the whole area maybe i need to actually go to the shed maybe there's something in there we'll wait for him to leave a little bit longer and we'll run past i mean there has to be something out here otherwise it would be silliness to have it you know wait in here maybe the lady came from?

1661
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:19,780
Oh, nice.

1662
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:21,140
Ah, no!

1663
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:23,500
Uh...

1664
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:25,240
Shoot.

1665
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:29,680
There's a ghost even on the map screen!

1666
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:30,380
Oh!

1667
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:32,820
Ah.

1668
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,000
Ah!

1669
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:39,480
Dang it.

1670
02:00:56,070 --> 02:00:57,830
Wait, so I focus.

1671
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:00,590
Oh!

1672
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:01,150
Ouch.

1673
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:06,640
Did I kill him?

1674
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:08,440
What's he doing?

1675
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:10,320
Zah, zah, zah.

1676
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:14,560
Whoa!

1677
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,400
Oh my god, he's...

1678
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,000
Oh, I got him.

1679
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:22,360
Whoops.

1680
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:23,240
Wrong button.

1681
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:27,420
Oh, so, okay.

1682
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,900
I haven't actually had to fight him so far, I think, so...

1683
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:31,540
Emma!

1684
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:32,460
Okay.

1685
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:34,460
My weapon's about to break!

1686
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:35,380
Oh, shoot, it is.

1687
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:37,200
Uh...

1688
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:41,870
Oh, that's no good.

1689
02:01:43,730 --> 02:01:45,120
And big baddies coming this way.

1690
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:50,050
Oh, I hide.

1691
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,740
And I guess we can replace it with the pipe.

1692
02:02:00,220 --> 02:02:00,840
To my right?

1693
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:03,560
What's to my right?

1694
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:08,300
Over there?

1695
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,740
That little shrine area?

1696
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:17,220
Saw a sledge on your right.

1697
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:17,600
What?

1698
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:19,220
Oh, this?

1699
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:20,860
Oh, it's not equipped.

1700
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:21,680
I think.

1701
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:27,100
Dude was minding his own business dealing with poison ivy allergy reactions.

1702
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:27,820
No!

1703
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:31,140
No, he...

1704
02:02:31,140 --> 02:02:32,300
Oh, oh, that!

1705
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:34,660
Oh, sledgehammer!

1706
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,140
Oh, I see!

1707
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,560
It packs a devastating punch, but its weight makes it hard to wield.

1708
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:44,540
I will attempt to use this.

1709
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:50,860
I'm not sure if I'll be very good at it because I'm not very good with, like, the super heavy weapons, but...

1710
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,540
I will try.

1711
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,740
Hold RT to unleash a powerful attack.

1712
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:00,180
The longer the attack is held, the more brutal it will be.

1713
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:05,040
While using focus, you will remain where you are and take a defensive stance.

1714
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:10,260
Oh, this will allow you to block most attacks, but your weapon's durability will decrease much faster.

1715
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:16,620
When your focus gauge is full, use RB to switch from a defensive position to unleash a focus attack.

1716
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:18,880
Neat.

1717
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:20,180
Thank you, guys.

1718
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:30,860
Okay, what I'm gonna do...

1719
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:36,440
Uh...

1720
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:39,520
I want to go sell stuff.

1721
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,700
I want to sell things!

1722
02:03:49,890 --> 02:03:50,370
Uh...

1723
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:50,810
Wait.

1724
02:03:51,870 --> 02:03:55,390
Yeah, I can't get back to the window from over here, so...

1725
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:56,730
I have to go back down.

1726
02:03:57,190 --> 02:03:58,510
We'll wait for him to pass again.

1727
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:02,030
I can't carry the carcass, that's the issue.

1728
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:05,790
That's why I want to go sell stuff.

1729
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:06,130
Oh,

1730
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,600
we gotta avoid this.

1731
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:16,660
This big boy.

1732
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:17,920
This big boy.

1733
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:21,620
No way.

1734
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:22,800
No stinking way.

1735
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:23,600
No way.

1736
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:25,120
Wait, I think I just trapped myself, you guys.

1737
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:26,480
You guys?

1738
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:27,320
I'm in trouble.

1739
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:28,420
Uh, you guys?

1740
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,060
I just...

1741
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:29,780
I just...

1742
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:30,020
Oh.

1743
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:30,720
Oh my god.

1744
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:31,120
Wait.

1745
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:32,140
There's no...

1746
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:45,940
Can we dodge through it?

1747
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:48,860
We can try!

1748
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:00,500
This is messed up.

1749
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:02,780
This is so messed up.

1750
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:04,720
Wait, this is actually so messed up.

1751
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:06,560
This is so messed up!

1752
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:18,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, this might be my opening!

1753
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:19,180
Get in through!

1754
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:26,900
Oh my god, I can't believe.

1755
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,220
I can't believe I somehow made it.

1756
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:30,240
Oh my gosh.

1757
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,820
I can't believe I somehow made it.

1758
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:35,560
Wait, I went the wrong way.

1759
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:36,380
Uh, shoot.

1760
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:38,680
Wait, we'll do something inside.

1761
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,560
Just run.

1762
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:40,700
Ah!

1763
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:45,770
We'll do something inside!

1764
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:46,310
Just go!

1765
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:12,860
That was too scary.

1766
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:15,040
That was way too scary.

1767
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:22,040
That was way too scary.

1768
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:24,320
Okay.

1769
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:25,980
I'm getting rid of you.

1770
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:27,840
I'm getting rid of you.

1771
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:30,520
Divine water.

1772
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:31,920
Get rid of you.

1773
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:56,840
All right, we can go back now.

1774
02:06:58,800 --> 02:06:59,900
I don't want to.

1775
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:05,450
I don't want to go back.

1776
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:14,080
Especially when they add enemies on top of big enemies.

1777
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:15,640
So mean.

1778
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,700
So mean for them to do.

1779
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:20,740
Oh my gosh, that thing goes.

1780
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:22,220
gets me every time.

1781
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:27,440
It's invincible even.

1782
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:28,900
It's the worst.

1783
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:38,690
I think I got everything I can over there.

1784
02:07:42,110 --> 02:07:47,350
I guess we just have to look around a bit more again.

1785
02:07:55,070 --> 02:08:26,780
Yeah, I need the keys still no i meant sorry when i said over there i meant here this area so i don't want to i don't need to go back all the way over there the shed only had the carcass from what i understand um i did not go into these areas over here so i think there's a hint in the school about where to look is there hold on i'll go read i'll go read what this said again

1786
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:36,760
just says I need the key.

1787
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:39,980
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1788
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,640
I can switch my...

1789
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,000
Steel.

1790
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:43,620
Oh, wait.

1791
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:45,760
I want to try this bad boy.

1792
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:55,240
Actually, I don't know if this is the right time to try this bad boy, because we're kind of in like a need to get out of there quickly kind of situation, but we'll hold on to it.

1793
02:09:06,150 --> 02:09:08,010
Is there anything in here that's had a hint?

1794
02:09:09,970 --> 02:09:10,970
I don't think so.

1795
02:09:16,530 --> 02:09:16,890
Okay.

1796
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:17,890
Aww.

1797
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:20,190
Aww.

1798
02:09:21,690 --> 02:09:22,170
Alright.

1799
02:09:23,990 --> 02:09:27,350
Well, at least he's not like camping just this area now.

1800
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:29,070
He's like walking back and forth, so.

1801
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:30,670
Could be worse.

1802
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,100
Just play dead.

1803
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:47,100
Oh, there's two of them.

1804
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:48,840
Is there...

1805
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:50,420
Okay, that one that was there is gone.

1806
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:51,960
Just play dead.

1807
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:52,580
Just play dead.

1808
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:54,680
She won't even notice.

1809
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:56,040
Okay.

1810
02:09:56,060 --> 02:09:56,540
Who?

1811
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:57,740
Where?

1812
02:09:58,540 --> 02:09:58,780
Who?

1813
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:02,100
Oh, is it him?

1814
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,360
Did he notice me?

1815
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:06,740
I see her, too.

1816
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,560
I see another lady walking around.

1817
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:15,660
From where?

1818
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,300
He's just making his way up.

1819
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:31,700
I'm gonna go get some more water real quick, you guys.

Okay, sorry.

1823
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:10,570
I'm so sorry.

1824
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:43,600
Look.

1825
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:44,680
You hear him?

1826
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:45,940
He's walking around.

1827
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:47,840
Stomp stomp in.

1828
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:50,680
With no regard.

1829
02:12:58,450 --> 02:13:01,690
Stomp stomp in around.

1830
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:03,290
Okaidii.

1831
02:13:03,450 --> 02:13:03,950
Tadaima!

1832
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:13,110
I had no hot water.

1833
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:17,930
I forgot to refill it.

1834
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:35,190
I see you is she the one that i woke up earlier i wonder okay so if i what who is it him noticing me

1837
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:09,850
Go away.

1838
02:14:10,090 --> 02:14:12,070
I'm gonna keep my pipe out just to be.

1839
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:14,270
Okay, go away.

1840
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:17,890
Yeah, this part's a little stinky, but that's okay.

1841
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:24,190
Before going back out, check the second floor stairs for a clue about the key location.

1842
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:26,050
Oh, but I did.

1843
02:14:26,810 --> 02:14:28,110
I went to the second floor stairs.

1844
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:31,150
Alright, we're just gonna run.

1845
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:32,450
If I die, I die.

1846
02:14:32,610 --> 02:14:33,070
That's fine.

1847
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:38,070
If I die, I die!

1848
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:39,070
Sa, sa, sa!

1849
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:40,430
Aw, shoot.

1850
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:43,430
Okay, I don't think I can go in there.

1851
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:47,950
Sa, sa, sa, sa, everything is running at me.

1852
02:14:48,270 --> 02:14:49,490
Everything is currently running at me.

1853
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:51,770
Everything is like running at me so much right now.

1854
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:54,070
I can hear them behind me.

1855
02:14:54,770 --> 02:14:56,310
She is right behind me, isn't she?

1856
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:57,870
Sa, sa, sa.

1857
02:15:00,110 --> 02:15:01,450
Okay, definitely can't go in there.

1858
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:02,750
We're dodging.

1859
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:03,390
You're playing dead.

1860
02:15:04,090 --> 02:15:05,050
I'm smarter than you.

1861
02:15:06,170 --> 02:15:11,310
Sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, I'm searching?

1862
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:14,070
Oh, God, he's right there.

1863
02:15:17,070 --> 02:15:18,850
Sa, sa, sa, sa.

1864
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:23,380
Ah!

1865
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:25,020
Wait, pick up!

1866
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:25,440
Yeah!

1867
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:28,180
Main building, second floor?

1868
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,600
Okay, wait, but I'm in kind of a...

1869
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:32,500
I'm in a bit of a pickle here.

1870
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:42,460
Sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa.

1871
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:44,740
Oh, look, this is where they do all the...

1872
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:47,840
Oh, that didn't sound good.

1873
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:48,680
Just keep running.

1874
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:49,780
Oh, shit!

1875
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:50,860
Wrong one!

1876
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:54,180
Here.

1877
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:55,800
Hit

1878
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:00,250
it.

1879
02:16:00,390 --> 02:16:01,190
Let me go save.

1880
02:16:01,330 --> 02:16:02,290
Oh, it saved for me.

1881
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:02,670
Yippee!

1882
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:03,270
Okay.

1883
02:16:06,770 --> 02:16:07,210
No.

1884
02:16:09,730 --> 02:16:12,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1885
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:12,890
Wait.

1886
02:16:22,810 --> 02:16:26,270
I can't tell if it's getting closer or not.

1887
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:28,510
Is it?

1888
02:16:37,290 --> 02:16:38,550
It doesn't seem like it.

1889
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:43,350
Okay, no, yeah, it doesn't seem like it.

1890
02:16:49,070 --> 02:16:49,430
Cool.

1891
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:55,090
Because you usually start streaming, and then for me, I keep thinking it must be like 2 a.m.

1892
02:16:55,090 --> 02:16:57,030
at least, then I check, and it's 10 p.m.

1893
02:16:57,590 --> 02:16:59,450
Looking for EU-friendly stream, of course!

1894
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:03,550
Oh, wait.

1895
02:17:03,650 --> 02:17:04,310
Okay.

1896
02:17:10,460 --> 02:17:11,620
Let me through.

1897
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:13,940
You're not gonna attack me, are you?

1898
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:15,660
Are you?

1899
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:24,430
Maybe it's fine.

1900
02:17:25,470 --> 02:17:26,290
It's up here, right?

1901
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:27,470
Yeah.

1902
02:17:27,810 --> 02:17:30,610
I guess I could also go the other way, but...

1903
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:31,610
Wait, no, this is...

1904
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:32,690
Wait, the key I got...

1905
02:17:32,690 --> 02:17:33,190
Hold on.

1906
02:17:33,810 --> 02:17:37,090
The key I got is for a second floor, right?

1907
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:40,690
Where is it?

1908
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:42,390
Collectibles.

1909
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:51,790
Yeah, okay, so we don't have the key for in there, which I'm guessing unlocks...

1910
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:55,750
Sorry, I didn't expect them to be behind me either.

1911
02:17:59,150 --> 02:17:59,410
Okay.

1912
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:03,090
Don't mind me.

1913
02:18:03,810 --> 02:18:04,530
Excuse me.

1914
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:05,690
Thank you.

1915
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:13,720
Maybe we're okay.

1916
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:21,040
I have it!

1917
02:18:22,340 --> 02:18:23,580
I have- I have the key!

1918
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:24,780
Wait.

1919
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:25,580
Wait.

1920
02:18:27,140 --> 02:18:28,600
Do I-

1921
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:32,190
Use.

1922
02:18:32,770 --> 02:18:33,690
Use the key!

1923
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:37,850
Oh, this is the annex.

1924
02:18:37,990 --> 02:18:38,410
It's not the second.

1925
02:18:38,870 --> 02:18:40,790
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

1926
02:18:41,390 --> 02:18:43,590
Okay, so we have to decide which way we want to go.

1927
02:18:44,070 --> 02:18:45,310
Pick our poison, I suppose.

1928
02:18:50,590 --> 02:18:50,970
Oh.

1929
02:18:53,470 --> 02:18:55,850
Either way doesn't seem great.

1930
02:18:57,870 --> 02:18:58,270
So...

1931
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:03,680
Let's go this way.

1932
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:05,100
It's closer to the save.

1933
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:09,400
I wish I could tell.

1934
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:12,400
I wish they would, like, twitch just a little bit, you know, sometimes.

1935
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:18,740
No, I forgot to get the carcass!

1936
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:21,860
Oh, shoot.

1937
02:19:22,180 --> 02:19:23,560
I forgot to get the carcass.

1938
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:32,360
Deciding if I want to go back out and get it?

1939
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:35,720
Dang it.

1940
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:36,740
Dang it.

1941
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,540
Yeah, I know I still can.

1942
02:19:39,660 --> 02:19:41,320
I'm just deciding if I want to do it.

1943
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:49,980
Surely I'm close enough.

1944
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:51,880
Yeah, that you're fine.

1945
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:56,320
Don't do anything when I turn around.

1946
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:58,520
Oh, gosh.

1947
02:19:58,600 --> 02:19:59,380
They're so scary.

1948
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:02,180
This one looks like trouble, though.

1949
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:05,700
What are you staring at?

1950
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:09,620
This one looks like trouble.

1951
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:11,100
This one, I think, is going to attack

1952
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:18,690
me.

1953
02:20:21,130 --> 02:20:21,950
Wait, do be dodging?

1954
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:24,390
Okay.

1955
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:28,010
Okay.

1956
02:20:30,910 --> 02:20:31,350
Alright.

1957
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:34,350
Maybe they were just...

1958
02:20:34,350 --> 02:20:35,290
Maybe they're all fine.

1959
02:20:35,390 --> 02:20:38,070
Maybe they're just introducing you that they're now here.

1960
02:20:38,550 --> 02:20:39,430
And you...

1961
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:40,710
You will be sad.

1962
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:43,670
Oh, wait.

1963
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:45,330
I forgot that it just auto-saved.

1964
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:45,830
But that's okay.

1965
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:56,750
that's fine I'm still deciding if I want to go back out we'll decide we'll decide but let's go upstairs first

1966
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:09,320
oh yeah telling you school is no longer safe do

1967
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:32,700
that wait what's here nothing thanks a whole bunch thank you so much

1968
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:56,100
all right let's see what we got what's the damage here oh these are well this one is open

1969
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:06,500
my old classroom oh that means there's something really bad in there

1970
02:22:11,590 --> 02:22:12,790
oh yep

1971
02:22:16,750 --> 02:22:24,390
wait is this this isn't like the in Silent Hill 3 that fills up with gas and he can't get out, right?

1972
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:27,890
I sat here and behind me was Dinko.

1973
02:22:28,050 --> 02:22:29,990
She used to give me the right answers.

1974
02:22:35,050 --> 02:22:35,850
Hinako isn't...

1975
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:37,110
Oh, unopened envelope.

1976
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:38,190
Hinako isn't coming.

1977
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:39,610
I'm sorry for lying to you.

1978
02:22:40,070 --> 02:22:43,790
But I thought that I needed to get you alone to find out how you truly feel.

1979
02:22:48,410 --> 02:22:50,570
Look into your heart and try opening this box.

1980
02:22:50,590 --> 02:22:51,850
with your true feelings.

1981
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:56,670
Do you remember that day when just the two of us went to that cafe?

1982
02:22:57,630 --> 02:23:02,250
We talked about how it felt like we were delinquent since we were supposed to be going to school that day.

1983
02:23:02,870 --> 02:23:03,510
But you know what?

1984
02:23:03,710 --> 02:23:08,770
I didn't care what the other people thought about us because as long as I could spend time with you, that was all I needed.

1985
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:10,970
We both ordered the same cake that day.

1986
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:16,870
I can still remember how my heart almost burst out of my chest the moment the same words flowed from those lips.

1987
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:19,230
The sweet and tart fruit on the cake.

1988
02:23:20,590 --> 02:23:22,030
in my mouth like it was yesterday.

1989
02:23:22,570 --> 02:23:24,350
Do you still remember the taste, too?

1990
02:23:25,490 --> 02:23:27,410
Ooh, la, la, opened the puzzle box.

1991
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:28,470
Okay.

1992
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:31,230
Oh, wait, you were...

1993
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:32,890
Oh, it's an actual puzzle box.

1994
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:35,550
Oh, okay, it's one of these where you, like...

1995
02:23:36,830 --> 02:23:37,470
Have to, like...

1996
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:40,930
Okay, we have to, like, slide it.

1997
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:42,130
Ah, wait!

1998
02:23:42,670 --> 02:23:47,910
What did I just play recently that had something like this?

1999
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:50,050
Okay.

2000
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:57,510
So we need to select the fruit, it seems.

2001
02:23:58,630 --> 02:23:59,710
Is that tamagozushi?

2002
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:11,020
Everything...

2003
02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:11,860
Sweet, maybe?

2004
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:14,420
No.

2005
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:16,140
It was Nancy Drew!

2006
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:24,700
Uh...

2007
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:26,700
Is this not...

2008
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:32,690
Wait, maybe the pie?

2009
02:24:34,550 --> 02:24:34,950
Ah!

2010
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:40,560
Looks like this...

2011
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:42,820
This room is filled with a different kind of toxicity.

2012
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:43,740
Poodoots.

2013
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:47,140
An opened envelope.

2014
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:48,180
So you did remember.

2015
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,220
Well, that makes me feel very special.

2016
02:24:50,860 --> 02:24:52,780
By the way, are you over Hinako now?

2017
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:56,020
I apologize if I sound blunt, but I want to make it clear.

2018
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:57,900
That girl is dead.

2019
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:02,740
I know you're going through a rough time right now, and you must be in so much pain.

2020
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:04,800
But you know I can be there for you.

2021
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:07,020
Would you rather go through it yourself still?

2022
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:10,560
Took you 20 minutes.

2023
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:12,500
It's you just picked the fruit.

2024
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:17,200
All you do is pick the fruit.

2025
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:25,380
I can picture a slowly unfolding the pages of our hearts, talking about all the small mundane details of our day-to-day lives.

2026
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:30,200
By filling up one journal after another with our thoughts, I know we can make a fresh start.

2027
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:34,260
A blank page upon which we can write a new story of our lives.

2028
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:36,040
Surely you can see it too.

2029
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:37,520
Oh, oh more?

2030
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:39,960
Okay.

2031
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:42,580
Starewell.

2032
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:48,320
The vice principal is so paranoid about his keys that he always takes them with him whenever he leaves.

2033
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:51,720
It's kind of ironic that he lost the keys to the stairwell.

2034
02:25:51,980 --> 02:25:52,600
Oh, okay.

2035
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:54,820
That was what we read earlier.

2036
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:57,480
And then this is the secret box.

2037
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:07,740
So I'm guessing just paint the books.

2038
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:09,260
Oh.

2039
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:20,170
Does the origami count?

2040
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:22,870
Maybe not.

2041
02:26:25,770 --> 02:26:28,550
Maybe the letter doesn't count because it's not blank.

2042
02:26:30,010 --> 02:26:30,490
Okay.

2043
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:34,670
Unopened envelope.

2044
02:26:36,010 --> 02:26:37,950
I'm glad to hear that you're trying to stay positive.

2045
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:41,650
And remember, I'll always be here for you if you need anything.

2046
02:26:42,870 --> 02:26:46,830
You know, you're not the only one who's sad because Hinako is no longer with us.

2047
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:48,070
If the two of...

2048
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:51,210
If the two of...

2049
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:54,070
typo.

2050
02:26:57,490 --> 02:27:06,830
If the two of us could huddle together, we could soothe this pain that bites like the cold of winter.

2051
02:27:09,630 --> 02:27:14,810
And then surely spring will arrive, welcoming us with Sakura in full bloom to celebrate our union.

2052
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:18,510
Can you picture the beautifully blooming Sakura awaiting us?

2053
02:27:18,970 --> 02:27:20,750
This girl is kind of...

2054
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:32,700
I'm guessing cherries don't count even though it's like a cherry blossom.

2055
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:35,960
I'm guessing it doesn't count.

2056
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:38,380
Actually, what counts here?

2057
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:39,840
There's a lot of plants.

2058
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:50,380
You're not the only one who sad Hinako is no longer with us.

2059
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:51,740
Sakuko is sad too.

2060
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:57,620
Doesn't it look like the two meteors from your name?

2061
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:00,640
Okay.

2062
02:28:05,630 --> 02:28:07,690
Maybe it's only flowers.

2063
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:14,850
And then these are cherry blossom petals, you can tell.

2064
02:28:15,050 --> 02:28:15,230
Oh, wait.

2065
02:28:15,450 --> 02:28:19,550
So maybe it's actually only the cherry blossoms themselves.

2066
02:28:20,310 --> 02:28:20,470
Whoops.

2067
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:21,170
Not bad.

2068
02:28:25,470 --> 02:28:25,770
Oh.

2069
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:29,950
Dear Shu, I like you.

2070
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:31,830
I love you.

2071
02:28:32,590 --> 02:28:34,650
I always have and I always will.

2072
02:28:35,410 --> 02:28:37,830
I'll be waiting to hear what you think about me.

2073
02:28:40,030 --> 02:28:45,010
Oh, second floor classroom generic key.

2074
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:48,010
It might unlock the classroom.

2075
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:51,010
Oh, Shu hasn't read this letter.

2076
02:28:56,300 --> 02:28:56,540
Okay.

2077
02:29:00,130 --> 02:29:01,370
What else we got in here?

2078
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:03,870
Or a Garmi!

2079
02:29:05,110 --> 02:29:06,310
She should just disappear.

2080
02:29:06,770 --> 02:29:55,730
someone kills her or abducts her abdux ducks ducks her i don't care just whatever gets hinako out of my life once and for all is this rinko's handwriting oh my god you guys were right she was oh i'm guessing that okay yeah that says dinko and shu and this is like those umbrellas the like the love umbrellas wow wow she's like actual yandere i bet behind the scribble says hinnako she's actually yandere oh oh wait that's junko who is junko oh her sister

2081
02:30:00,650 --> 02:30:23,300
oh Oh

2082
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:32,980
no, the school's all messed up now.

2083
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:41,790
Explore the school's second floor!

2084
02:30:42,710 --> 02:30:43,350
Yuppie!

2085
02:30:44,930 --> 02:30:48,970
I maybe should have explored before it turned to flowers.

2086
02:30:50,670 --> 02:30:51,310
Maybe.

2087
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:57,450
It looks like Shu hasn't read this letter.

2088
02:30:58,110 --> 02:30:58,610
That's funny.

2089
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:02,290
Aw, man.

2090
02:31:02,930 --> 02:31:05,370
Wait, was there anything else in here that I missed?

2091
02:31:05,950 --> 02:31:07,090
I don't think so.

2092
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:09,670
Oh, cat.

2093
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:10,030
Oh.

2094
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:11,750
What the hell?

2095
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:13,870
Where did that come from?

2096
02:31:14,050 --> 02:31:14,410
Ew!

2097
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:17,110
Rico, you're such a freak.

2098
02:31:17,530 --> 02:31:18,890
This is a dead bird.

2099
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:21,310
Wait.

2100
02:31:23,370 --> 02:31:24,610
Is that a sparrow?

2101
02:31:27,770 --> 02:31:28,970
Because I...

2102
02:31:28,970 --> 02:31:29,390
Wait.

2103
02:31:29,450 --> 02:31:30,050
hold on.

2104
02:31:30,810 --> 02:31:35,230
I was watching like an explanation of everybody's names.

2105
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:43,250
I was watching a video of an explanation of everybody's names like the other day of this game.

2106
02:31:45,370 --> 02:31:50,970
I think Hinako no because no who was it?

2107
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:52,410
One of them had

2108
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:05,680
one of them had like one of them was Sparrow but I don't remember Hinako is baby bird.

2109
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,760
But I thought it was that...

2110
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:09,180
Wait, isn't that the...

2111
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:12,140
Isn't that the kanji though for Hinamatsuri?

2112
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:18,020
Game over screen has the bird on it.

2113
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:18,900
You're right!

2114
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:20,640
You're right, you're right.

2115
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:24,820
Oh my gosh.

2116
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:27,000
The lighting is like so crazy.

2117
02:32:27,740 --> 02:32:27,920
Spooky.

2118
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:33,740
Yeah, it's kind of bad.

2119
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:35,320
Oh, it just saved.

2120
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:36,160
That's also bad.

2121
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:38,720
Don't like that.

2122
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:40,880
Don't like that.

2123
02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:53,390
This looks important.

2124
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:54,310
Final exam.

2125
02:32:54,490 --> 02:32:55,750
Fourth place, Asakura Ayumi.

2126
02:32:58,750 --> 02:32:59,390
Oh, okay.

2127
02:33:01,390 --> 02:33:01,890
Okay.

2128
02:33:02,370 --> 02:33:02,970
Oh, wait!

2129
02:33:03,890 --> 02:33:04,490
479!

2130
02:33:04,570 --> 02:33:06,390
That must be her thing!

2131
02:33:07,570 --> 02:33:08,550
Nice toolkit.

2132
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:10,530
That must be...

2133
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:12,350
Wait, but it was Aoi, no?

2134
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,340
The locker code.

2135
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:17,800
Wait, but...

2136
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:28,520
that was maybe the guy has a crush on her and made her score or something like his combination what was it wait

2137
02:33:34,070 --> 02:33:50,670
479 479 479 okay I'm gonna go back downstairs and hopefully not die there are more lockers oh there are maybe oh I haven't gone been able to go into the girls locker room yet so Maybe that's why.

2138
02:33:55,620 --> 02:33:59,700
Sometimes I really can't tell what is sound of...

2139
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:03,380
of meaty flowers and what is sound of spooky...

2140
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:09,280
A spooky creature walking.

2141
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:10,600
You know.

2142
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:14,060
I'm scared.

2143
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,320
I'm checking all my angles.

2144
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:18,700
We go in, hesitantly.

2145
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:21,680
Okay.

2146
02:34:22,380 --> 02:34:22,660
Maybe?

2147
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:23,640
Oh, what's this?

2148
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:26,600
Old Anna- Ah!

2149
02:34:27,220 --> 02:34:27,520
Wait.

2150
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:28,180
Oh, no.

2151
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:33,560
Wait, now that I've gotten that, I feel more scary things are going to happen.

2152
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:34,560
No!

2153
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:36,560
Note to teacher.

2154
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:42,440
Ayumi from the track and field club said she found a key with key box written on it during practice.

2155
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:49,200
If she still hasn't gotten it back to you, then she probably left it in her locker when she went to change.

2156
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:51,660
To be honest, I shouldn't be surprised if she forgot.

2157
02:34:52,380 --> 02:34:53,960
Exhausted after practice.

2158
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:56,860
Open the locker in the locker room.

2159
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:09,240
Bandage.

2160
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:10,120
I'll take that.

2161
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:10,920
Thank you very much.

2162
02:35:13,060 --> 02:35:13,720
Anything else?

2163
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:15,040
Maybe not.

2164
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:17,760
Spooky music.

2165
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:19,640
Spooky music.

2166
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:20,180
Spooky.

2167
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:21,020
Spooky, Spooky, don't mind.

2168
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:24,620
Oh, it's spooky.

2169
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:25,320
What?

2170
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:26,820
Oh, this is their schedule.

2171
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:27,600
I was like, what?

2172
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:29,260
That's so much kanji.

2173
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:31,200
Oh, God.

2174
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:34,360
No, this schedule is insane.

2175
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:36,420
Winter break.

2176
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:47,100
What is that?

2177
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:51,660
The Hina and her name has the same kanji in Hinamizawa as well.

2178
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,480
Woo-woo-woo.

2179
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:55,300
Yeah.

2180
02:36:03,220 --> 02:36:04,180
Kanji, no.

2181
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:05,780
Is there even a kanji?

2182
02:36:06,140 --> 02:36:06,540
Let's see.

2183
02:36:07,260 --> 02:36:08,140
Kanji class.

2184
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:10,180
There's Ago.

2185
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:14,300
I don't see it.

2186
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:15,280
If there is.

2187
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:19,340
Just at a glance.

2188
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:20,920
Kanji scares me too, don't worry.

2189
02:36:21,380 --> 02:36:22,420
I'm so bad.

2190
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:25,140
I knew it.

2191
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:25,740
I knew it.

2192
02:36:25,820 --> 02:36:27,300
As soon as I picked up...

2193
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:29,900
As soon as I picked up that key, I knew.

2194
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:32,520
Oh my god.

2195
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:35,560
I knew.

2196
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:36,280
I knew.

2197
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:39,620
I knew I should have explored before picking that up.

2198
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:44,520
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

2199
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:46,460
Ah!

2200
02:36:46,740 --> 02:36:54,300
Well, we've had a good while without having to touch any monsters, so...

2201
02:36:55,860 --> 02:36:57,860
It's so cool looking.

2202
02:36:58,400 --> 02:36:59,940
Wait, how do I...

2203
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:04,740
It's such a good visual, it's so cool.

2204
02:37:23,250 --> 02:37:23,790
Whoa.

2205
02:37:25,390 --> 02:37:26,870
I didn't read what room this was.

2206
02:37:32,190 --> 02:37:34,390
Oh, there's a bunch of toys, though.

2207
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:34,870
What's this?

2208
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:36,850
Oh, my gosh.

2209
02:37:37,630 --> 02:37:40,450
Tee-tee is the most disgusting person I've ever met.

2210
02:37:40,630 --> 02:37:42,270
I wish someone would destroy her locker.

2211
02:37:42,810 --> 02:37:47,330
If anyone wants to make my wish come true, her locker combination is 3-7-7.

2212
02:37:48,090 --> 02:37:48,510
Tee-tee.

2213
02:37:51,850 --> 02:37:53,010
Oh, it's so bad!

2214
02:38:00,330 --> 02:38:01,450
Higurashi real!

2215
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:02,810
Higurashi real!

2216
02:38:06,790 --> 02:38:07,570
Uso da!

2217
02:38:07,830 --> 02:38:08,190
Uso da!

2218
02:38:19,470 --> 02:38:20,690
Um, what was I gonna?

2219
02:38:23,170 --> 02:38:23,650
I...

2220
02:38:23,650 --> 02:38:25,490
Oh yeah, I was gonna check the...

2221
02:38:28,250 --> 02:38:32,750
It seems that making secret codes with numbers and symbols is all the craze these days.

2222
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:33,990
What?

2223
02:38:34,130 --> 02:38:35,090
When did I read that?

2224
02:38:36,950 --> 02:38:37,430
What?

2225
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:44,900
Wait, when did I read that?

2226
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:46,200
I heard that.

2227
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:49,440
Oh.

2228
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:53,580
Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar.

2229
02:38:55,200 --> 02:39:02,680
I personally would have localized that as liar, liar pants on fire, but that's just an artistic choice of mine.

2230
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:13,500
Scary!

2231
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:15,740
So scary!

2232
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:19,400
Yeah!

2233
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:19,620
Yeah!

2234
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:20,580
Yeah!

2235
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:24,740
I think your version captures the nuance better.

2236
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:33,060
Yeah, there's just like, you know, some things are just really hard to, you know, localize.

2237
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:36,040
They have deeper meanings than just being translated directly.

2238
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:42,980
And I think saying liar, liar, pants on fire, really just demonstrates the gravity of the situation.

2239
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:43,780
You know what I mean?

2240
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:48,320
Oh my gosh, the map!

2241
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:49,520
It's so cool.

2242
02:39:51,500 --> 02:40:00,060
Boyd, I wonder if the origami in this room, because it showed the, what's it called?

2243
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:04,060
The combination of the locker?

2244
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:07,220
If that's a lie, if you don't believe it.

2245
02:40:10,260 --> 02:40:11,700
Okay, I'm, like, way scared.

2246
02:40:13,660 --> 02:40:29,100
And I have a, I'm definitely looking like Hinako right now, rubbing my arm, being like, But I feel like maybe it's better to be attacked by only one guy instead of potentially three.

2247
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:32,660
So, I'm going to take a sipy and we're going to be brave.

2248
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:55,360
Bravery!

2249
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:58,540
Bravery rewarded me!

2250
02:41:00,820 --> 02:41:02,440
Bravery rewarded me!

2251
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:04,380
Wow, it's getting really bad in here, though.

2252
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:10,340
It's getting sticky, sticky situation.

2253
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:13,620
Wait, can I even go this way?

2254
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:17,200
Oh my gosh.

2255
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:18,630
I can't see it.

2256
02:41:23,020 --> 02:41:24,020
That's scary.

2257
02:41:28,660 --> 02:41:29,600
Oh, that's scary.

2258
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:33,660
I don't know if I checked over here.

2259
02:41:43,790 --> 02:41:45,270
I don't like it.

2260
02:41:51,670 --> 02:41:53,150
I still can't...

2261
02:41:53,150 --> 02:41:53,790
Okay, yeah.

2262
02:41:55,150 --> 02:41:58,150
But where did all the creatures go here?

2263
02:42:00,270 --> 02:42:01,990
Doesn't look scary to you, yeah?

2264
02:42:04,190 --> 02:42:05,770
Wow, Chucky, you're so brave.

2265
02:42:05,930 --> 02:42:06,450
Oh no!

2266
02:42:07,110 --> 02:42:10,410
We missed out on the carcass.

2267
02:42:10,670 --> 02:42:12,130
Dang it, I should have gone back.

2268
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:14,130
That's my bed.

2269
02:42:14,950 --> 02:42:17,930
That is absolutely my bed.

2270
02:42:20,470 --> 02:42:21,070
Oh, and now...

2271
02:42:21,090 --> 02:42:22,070
now the lights on here.

2272
02:42:22,510 --> 02:42:22,510
Wait.

2273
02:42:23,270 --> 02:42:25,210
Is that someone hanging from the... Yes, it is.

2274
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:29,030
That is somebody hanging from...

2275
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,930
Oh, there's a couple girls.

2276
02:42:30,430 --> 02:42:31,950
A couple people hanging from the ceiling.

2277
02:42:32,690 --> 02:42:33,030
Wow.

2278
02:42:33,130 --> 02:42:35,610
The visuals in this section are immaculate.

2279
02:42:35,730 --> 02:42:36,990
They're so stinking good.

2280
02:42:38,030 --> 02:42:39,630
Okay, we still don't have this.

2281
02:42:39,730 --> 02:42:40,290
Yeah, okay.

2282
02:42:40,610 --> 02:42:44,210
So I'm guessing we get one...

2283
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:49,980
I'm surprised these are alive.

2284
02:42:50,780 --> 02:42:59,940
We get probably the key and to get the key in there to get the key to there is my guess.

2285
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:06,940
It's so good.

2286
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:10,480
I'm loving the visuals in this area!

2287
02:43:12,540 --> 02:43:14,000
It's so scary!

2288
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:19,360
It's so good, so good.

2289
02:43:20,180 --> 02:43:20,520
Sorry.

2290
02:43:21,380 --> 02:43:21,680
Okay.

2291
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,340
Whoa.

2292
02:43:33,480 --> 02:44:08,280
checking my corners checking my corners okay all right actually I'm going to go save if that's all right you guys that game has an auto saved in a minute and I think I want to sell some stuff I think This section is very, very neat.

2293
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:09,780
I like it a lot.

2294
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:11,840
I'm quite a fan.

2295
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:26,680
It hasn't spread, I guess, a crazy amount in this area.

2296
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:30,180
Okay.

2297
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:35,600
We'll just save over that.

2298
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:42,240
And then...

2299
02:44:42,520 --> 02:44:44,060
We got a lot of Arate.

2300
02:44:45,020 --> 02:44:46,520
It restores health, but...

2301
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:50,520
We'll get rid of like...

2302
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:53,540
three of them?

2303
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:56,320
That's like nothing, but whatever.

2304
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:57,020
It's fine.

2305
02:44:57,880 --> 02:45:00,520
If all I can hold is five, I want to have more...

2306
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:04,480
Actually, I don't know how much I can hold, but it's okay.

2307
02:45:05,160 --> 02:45:05,560
Yeah.

2308
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:09,360
Yeah.

2309
02:45:11,380 --> 02:45:11,780
Okay.

2310
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:27,000
There's like a tiny amount of health, and there's also a tiny amount of offering that we get anyway, so...

2311
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:27,980
Okie dokie!

2312
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:31,940
Yeah, they did cook with this area.

2313
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:33,220
It's so spooky.

2314
02:45:36,380 --> 02:45:37,440
So scary.

2315
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:39,900
So, so scary.

2316
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:46,060
Alright.

2317
02:45:48,140 --> 02:45:50,000
Anyway, a gas.

2318
02:45:57,260 --> 02:45:58,920
Well, let's see.

2319
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:05,180
Oh, there's only two doors I can try, so let's do the close one first.

2320
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:16,620
I say that because the further away one probably has important stuff.

2321
02:46:19,740 --> 02:46:21,320
More scribbles.

2322
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:28,750
Um, what is that?

2323
02:46:30,170 --> 02:46:32,750
Well, some sort of letter or something.

2324
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:43,860
Oh, another toolkit!

2325
02:46:44,180 --> 02:46:44,660
Huge!

2326
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,480
Wait, I could heal my knife.

2327
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:50,080
Because we have two.

2328
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:55,080
We'll do that before I, like, forget to, you know.

2329
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:56,320
Alright.

2330
02:46:58,620 --> 02:46:59,180
Maybe, okay.

2331
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:00,160
Walk around.

2332
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:02,520
Little entrance for us, thank you.

2333
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:06,200
What?

2334
02:47:07,260 --> 02:47:08,740
I hate this game.

2335
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:10,740
Well, uh, wait.

2336
02:47:17,770 --> 02:47:20,770
It's square root of six is three, right?

2337
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:21,810
No, wait.

2338
02:47:22,210 --> 02:47:23,710
Oh, I don't know!

2339
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:29,860
So, Miki.

2340
02:47:41,420 --> 02:47:42,380
I give up.

2341
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:46,460
I give up.

2342
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:51,840
I give up.

2343
02:47:55,100 --> 02:48:00,760
Miki learned square roots yesterday in class and said, this is my entire personality now.

2344
02:48:04,870 --> 02:48:06,030
It's actually what happened.

2345
02:48:06,970 --> 02:48:08,110
Note from a male student.

2346
02:48:08,730 --> 02:48:11,550
It's the code for baka, so you know, stupid.

2347
02:48:12,290 --> 02:48:14,150
Girl code is based off the alphabet.

2348
02:48:15,150 --> 02:48:16,150
Girl code.

2349
02:48:17,210 --> 02:48:18,890
Girl code is based off the alphabet.

2350
02:48:19,210 --> 02:48:22,750
Basically, you just switch letters with numbers and symbols that look like them.

2351
02:48:23,350 --> 02:48:29,510
So Sato would be, 5, 4 plus 0, 6.

2352
02:48:30,630 --> 02:48:32,450
5 looks like S.

2353
02:48:32,870 --> 02:48:33,590
And 4 looks like...

2354
02:48:33,590 --> 02:48:34,850
This is just Leet speak.

2355
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:38,230
And the plus is T.

2356
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:40,610
Wow, I wonder...

2357
02:48:40,610 --> 02:48:40,990
What...

2358
02:48:40,990 --> 02:48:42,450
How did they...

2359
02:48:43,670 --> 02:48:45,410
How did they...

2360
02:48:46,050 --> 02:48:46,530
How...

2361
02:48:46,530 --> 02:48:49,150
What the original is like, you know, in Japanese?

2362
02:48:51,690 --> 02:48:52,710
The 0 is O.

2363
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:54,450
Because they're basically the same shape.

2364
02:48:54,590 --> 02:48:56,730
6 doesn't really look like it, but apparently it's...

2365
02:48:56,750 --> 02:49:06,670
you so for my name Yoshida it would be x05174

2366
02:49:10,590 --> 02:49:24,800
okay a uh a i s i

2367
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:30,920
T, B.

2368
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:40,560
I don't know what the hell the square root is supposed to be

2369
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I don't think it's Aish that do you guys unless it does say that it's a love note but it says XOXO

2370
02:49:59,050 --> 02:50:03,390
Aish Oh, instead of the plus being...

2371
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:03,870
Oh, wait.

2372
02:50:04,630 --> 02:50:06,150
Oh, Aishiteru.

2373
02:50:07,310 --> 02:50:07,670
Oh.

2374
02:50:12,250 --> 02:50:14,150
Damn, you're saying that in middle school?

2375
02:50:16,230 --> 02:50:19,170
Girl is serious, serious.

2376
02:50:20,750 --> 02:50:21,290
Dang.

2377
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:24,190
Yeah, Aishiteru makes sense.

2378
02:50:26,330 --> 02:50:26,750
What's that?

2379
02:50:27,090 --> 02:50:27,830
This is...

2380
02:50:27,830 --> 02:50:28,050
Okay.

2381
02:50:33,740 --> 02:50:36,200
Note between lovers, Miki.

2382
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:42,500
I have absolutely no idea how that crazy formula spells Aishteru.

2383
02:50:44,840 --> 02:50:46,280
But I love you too.

2384
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:54,920
Miki, you're...

2385
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:57,560
Girl, you're kind of crazy, but...

2386
02:50:58,240 --> 02:50:59,180
Me too, I guess.

2387
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:04,340
The absolute vibes of that note.

2388
02:51:05,980 --> 02:51:06,780
So funny.

2389
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:18,000
I don't like it, I don't like it!

2390
02:51:21,630 --> 02:51:23,990
I think I hear something breathing, but...

2391
02:51:23,990 --> 02:51:25,950
I could be extremely paranoid.

2392
02:51:33,250 --> 02:51:33,810
Okay.

2393
02:51:35,830 --> 02:51:36,390
Okay.

2394
02:51:37,850 --> 02:51:39,710
Alright, before we do that...

2395
02:51:39,710 --> 02:51:41,530
Oh, we're searching for somebody's desk.

2396
02:51:41,710 --> 02:51:41,890
Okay.

2397
02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:43,050
Oh, geez.

2398
02:51:43,490 --> 02:51:43,730
Okay.

2399
02:51:45,510 --> 02:51:46,070
Oh,

2400
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:50,120
lock a room key!

2401
02:51:52,060 --> 02:51:52,900
Asakura's textbook.

2402
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:54,580
I am a tortoise.

2403
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:57,360
The bus is calling out to me.

2404
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:00,080
I didn't get the news that school would be so far away.

2405
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:00,920
Bus?

2406
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:01,680
Bus!

2407
02:52:01,940 --> 02:52:03,280
The best thing in the world!

2408
02:52:03,700 --> 02:52:06,400
I love it so much that I made it my locker combination.

2409
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,640
Moment of silence for the localizers.

2410
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,320
They just totally...

2411
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:19,160
They completely gave up.

2412
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:21,520
Even translating Aishiteru.

2413
02:52:21,720 --> 02:52:24,660
They were like, if you're playing this game, you probably Wait, no, you wee-a-boo.

2414
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:29,380
Orgar me of grievances.

2415
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:33,800
Oh, how I wish I could just climb inside his locker and drown in his smell.

2416
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:37,760
I can't believe his combination is the same as his name.

2417
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:38,400
Ow!

2418
02:52:38,680 --> 02:52:41,200
Oh, so 401.

2419
02:52:41,720 --> 02:52:44,280
That's so cute of him using his name and code.

2420
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:49,460
Okay, there's so many locker combinations.

2421
02:52:50,720 --> 02:52:50,940
Wait.

2422
02:52:51,480 --> 02:52:52,420
It's chocolate.

2423
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:55,800
Lots of chocolate around these parts too.

2424
02:53:06,770 --> 02:53:07,670
Asakura Ayami.

2425
02:53:10,070 --> 02:53:11,650
Roll four line two.

2426
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:15,070
Well, I already...

2427
02:53:15,070 --> 02:53:16,550
I mean...

2428
02:53:16,550 --> 02:53:18,030
I didn't need to read it.

2429
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:19,610
She's so real.

2430
02:53:20,170 --> 02:53:21,390
Boy smell, boy smell!

2431
02:53:21,930 --> 02:53:26,090
I wish I could just hide in his locker and bask in his gym clothes.

2432
02:53:27,530 --> 02:53:31,550
Does Minky need to go read some Mega Tokyo to brush up on her lead speak?

2433
02:53:32,650 --> 02:53:34,130
Clearly I do.

2434
02:53:39,020 --> 02:53:40,180
Okay, so there's probably...

2435
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:42,120
Ouch, I keep biting my tongue recently.

2436
02:53:44,180 --> 02:53:45,160
Alright, mannequins!

2437
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:47,260
Aha, there you are.

2438
02:53:48,520 --> 02:53:49,400
I knew it.

2439
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,220
I knew you'd be here.

2440
02:53:53,260 --> 02:53:54,620
You're following me.

2441
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:57,420
You like me or something.

2442
02:54:01,980 --> 02:54:02,660
Holy!

2443
02:54:04,140 --> 02:54:04,360
Get

2444
02:54:11,010 --> 02:54:11,350
out!

2445
02:54:12,090 --> 02:54:14,650
We stun-locked her before she could do anything.

2446
02:54:15,750 --> 02:54:19,210
Dang, this thing- No!

2447
02:54:20,490 --> 02:54:23,370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2448
02:54:24,470 --> 02:54:27,190
I wonder if I could kill it so it doesn't stalk me anymore.

2449
02:54:34,490 --> 02:54:37,830
If I- if I kill it, will it stop- keep stalking me?

2450
02:54:39,210 --> 02:54:40,170
Will it stop?

2451
02:54:46,510 --> 02:54:47,650
Give it a whack.

2452
02:55:01,470 --> 02:55:01,910
Again?

2453
02:55:02,290 --> 02:55:02,670
Oh, okay.

2454
02:55:03,930 --> 02:55:04,230
Alright.

2455
02:55:04,450 --> 02:55:05,070
Alright, he's gone.

2456
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:05,510
He's gone.

2457
02:55:07,430 --> 02:55:07,850
We're safe.

2458
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:08,290
We're safe.

2459
02:55:09,830 --> 02:55:15,230
I'm like, I'm not, I will not have you pulling that stunt on me.

2460
02:55:19,220 --> 02:55:21,360
They're not all dangerous now, are you guys?

2461
02:55:22,580 --> 02:55:24,560
You're not gonna fall from the ceiling, are you?

2462
02:55:25,180 --> 02:55:25,980
I have a knife.

2463
02:55:37,770 --> 02:55:38,390
Wait, did I?

2464
02:55:39,490 --> 02:55:40,410
Oh, no, no, no.

2465
02:55:40,650 --> 02:55:41,370
This is...

2466
02:55:41,370 --> 02:55:42,130
Okay, just kidding.

2467
02:55:43,430 --> 02:55:43,610
Ah!

2468
02:55:43,750 --> 02:55:46,970
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.

2469
02:55:47,370 --> 02:55:47,590
Okay.

2470
02:55:47,590 --> 02:55:50,070
Let's go to Aoi Kun first.

2471
02:55:55,610 --> 02:55:56,070
Okay.

2472
02:55:57,270 --> 02:55:57,890
A...

2473
02:55:57,890 --> 02:55:59,470
I call him...

2474
02:55:59,470 --> 02:55:59,710
Okay.

2475
02:55:59,950 --> 02:56:00,330
Aoi.

2476
02:56:00,830 --> 02:56:01,310
Aoi.

2477
02:56:02,570 --> 02:56:03,190
Aoi.

2478
02:56:04,300 --> 02:56:04,610
Aoi.

2479
02:56:06,910 --> 02:56:07,530
Yeah!

2480
02:56:08,550 --> 02:56:09,170
Okay.

2481
02:56:09,790 --> 02:56:10,410
Okay!

2482
02:56:10,830 --> 02:56:11,770
I got...

2483
02:56:11,770 --> 02:56:12,970
Oh, another Orog army!

2484
02:56:13,350 --> 02:56:14,110
I happen to find...

2485
02:56:14,130 --> 02:56:15,910
out Suga's locker combination.

2486
02:56:16,050 --> 02:56:19,430
The weird thing is, when you convert it to code, it looks like a cry for help.

2487
02:56:20,270 --> 02:56:21,310
What am I supposed to do?

2488
02:56:21,710 --> 02:56:23,410
It's not like I can do anything.

2489
02:56:25,330 --> 02:56:25,650
What?

2490
02:56:25,830 --> 02:56:27,130
Were there other lockers?

2491
02:56:30,250 --> 02:56:31,050
That I could get?

2492
02:56:34,260 --> 02:56:36,500
I don't remember seeing any others, but...

2493
02:56:37,360 --> 02:56:38,880
I thought it was just the one, guys.

2494
02:56:40,700 --> 02:56:41,060
Yeah.

2495
02:56:41,800 --> 02:56:42,800
So now we gotta...

2496
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:43,960
Wait, was there anything here?

2497
02:56:44,180 --> 02:56:44,580
Okay, yeah.

2498
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:45,480
So now we gotta go to the...

2499
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:46,200
girl's room.

2500
02:56:52,840 --> 02:56:53,420
Eew.

2501
02:56:59,770 --> 02:56:59,770
I

2502
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:05,460
wish I could shut the door.

2503
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:08,720
Alright.

2504
02:57:09,020 --> 02:57:10,820
Whose lockers we got in here?

2505
02:57:12,340 --> 02:57:14,000
This used to be my locker.

2506
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:19,600
This is Ayumi.

2507
02:57:22,440 --> 02:57:23,540
What was...

2508
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:24,060
Oh gosh.

2509
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:31,880
She had I think hers was probably her score.

2510
02:57:35,640 --> 02:57:37,140
Was it 749?

2511
02:57:37,560 --> 02:57:38,220
Was that what it was?

2512
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:40,300
Let's try it.

2513
02:57:45,490 --> 02:57:45,850
No.

2514
02:57:48,890 --> 02:57:50,430
479, thank you.

2515
02:57:53,790 --> 02:57:54,210
No?

2516
02:57:57,330 --> 02:57:59,070
479 was the score.

2517
02:57:59,490 --> 02:58:01,410
So it wasn't that.

2518
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:05,030
Ayumi, ayumi, ayumi.

2519
02:58:07,190 --> 02:58:07,710
Bus!

2520
02:58:08,230 --> 02:58:09,830
Bus is the best thing in the world.

2521
02:58:10,390 --> 02:58:11,810
So, okay, so that's her lock.

2522
02:58:13,910 --> 02:58:15,550
Staying hydrated, I miss all that whore.

2523
02:58:15,770 --> 02:58:16,350
I am!

2524
02:58:16,490 --> 02:58:17,170
Thank you!

2525
02:58:17,350 --> 02:58:18,230
I'll take another sip here.

2526
02:58:22,020 --> 02:58:23,060
Maybe three.

2527
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:24,600
What was you again?

2528
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:30,680
Six, three, six, five.

2529
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:46,580
five or eight six five eight six six ah why do i keep thinking three for me i should have waited for this one

2530
02:58:51,470 --> 02:58:55,850
i should have waited suga

2531
02:59:03,350 --> 02:59:09,990
looks like a cry for help And then TT is 377.

2532
02:59:11,630 --> 02:59:13,450
Whoever TT is.

2533
02:59:13,770 --> 02:59:14,770
Cry for help.

2534
02:59:14,910 --> 02:59:15,350
SOS?

2535
02:59:22,130 --> 02:59:22,730
Aha!

2536
02:59:25,290 --> 02:59:26,350
You good girl?

2537
02:59:27,430 --> 02:59:31,430
My school bag is a bit worn out for some reason, but it's fine for carrying small things.

2538
02:59:31,830 --> 02:59:32,270
Nice!

2539
02:59:32,930 --> 02:59:34,470
Oh, huge, huge!

2540
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:36,490
Why is my school bag here?

2541
02:59:37,210 --> 02:59:38,070
That's kind of freaky.

2542
02:59:40,370 --> 02:59:42,270
And then this is...

2543
02:59:42,270 --> 02:59:42,630
TT!

2544
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:43,950
377.

2545
02:59:44,830 --> 02:59:49,450
I feel like something bad's gonna happen here though.

2546
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:54,180
Oh!

2547
02:59:54,900 --> 02:59:57,900
Deals additional damage when using weapons with high durability.

2548
02:59:58,260 --> 03:00:00,300
Effective only for weapons with durability.

2549
03:00:04,300 --> 03:00:04,600
Nice!

2550
03:00:05,220 --> 03:00:07,020
And this looks like Ramene, yop, yop, yop.

2551
03:00:08,280 --> 03:00:09,140
Yop, yop, yop.

2552
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:10,640
Yes.

2553
03:00:12,600 --> 03:00:13,160
Cool!

2554
03:00:13,900 --> 03:00:14,540
Cool, cool, cool.

2555
03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:15,260
Okay.

2556
03:00:15,820 --> 03:00:16,680
She the wolf.

2557
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:18,180
She a lone wolf.

2558
03:00:20,340 --> 03:00:25,040
All right, I think I got everything here, so let's, um, face the outdoors.

2559
03:00:25,580 --> 03:00:28,100
Oh, I already see somebody standing there.

2560
03:00:35,950 --> 03:00:38,690
I couldn't perhaps go up the other way.

2561
03:00:39,230 --> 03:00:41,730
Go upstairs and go the opposite way, could I?

2562
03:00:48,030 --> 03:00:50,470
I couldn't have... I couldn't go the long way.

2563
03:00:50,490 --> 03:00:51,130
Could I?

2564
03:00:51,490 --> 03:00:51,610
Maybe.

2565
03:01:02,250 --> 03:01:02,970
Oh, gosh.

2566
03:01:03,790 --> 03:01:04,730
Scared me, sorry.

2567
03:01:10,570 --> 03:01:11,610
I'm deciding.

2568
03:01:12,970 --> 03:01:14,670
I'm currently deciding what I want to do.

2569
03:01:19,460 --> 03:01:22,140
The durability is already I have, and we've only fought, too.

2570
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,260
Let me go upstairs.

2571
03:01:26,040 --> 03:01:27,860
And see what the situation looks like.

2572
03:01:29,220 --> 03:01:31,580
If it's bad, we'll just go back downstairs.

2573
03:01:32,900 --> 03:01:34,800
These ones don't seem to move, though.

2574
03:01:38,560 --> 03:01:39,020
So...

2575
03:01:44,460 --> 03:01:45,660
Is there anyone up here?

2576
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:52,460
Okay.

2577
03:01:56,680 --> 03:02:09,360
I can't again, once again, I'm paranoid because I can't tell if I'm hearing sounds of something walking or flower sounds, you know.

2578
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:12,840
So paranoid.

2579
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:14,860
This game makes me very paranoid.

2580
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:24,980
There was something on the floor to pick up.

2581
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:25,640
Wait, there was?

2582
03:02:26,340 --> 03:02:26,840
Where are?

2583
03:02:29,420 --> 03:02:30,420
Note on the floor.

2584
03:02:32,340 --> 03:02:32,900
Over here?

2585
03:02:34,460 --> 03:02:35,060
Oh, I see.

2586
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:35,760
I see it.

2587
03:02:36,080 --> 03:02:37,000
Wait, there's a couple.

2588
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:37,820
Wait.

2589
03:02:38,700 --> 03:02:39,140
Why?

2590
03:02:39,900 --> 03:02:41,640
Wait, guys, this is bad.

2591
03:02:42,020 --> 03:02:43,600
Wait, there's so many pills on the floor.

2592
03:02:44,620 --> 03:02:45,060
Why?

2593
03:02:46,220 --> 03:02:46,520
Why?

2594
03:02:46,880 --> 03:02:49,140
Gotta go help a buddy move and I don't wanna...

2595
03:02:49,140 --> 03:02:50,660
Gotta get a moi-moi cue, moi-moi go!

2596
03:02:51,240 --> 03:02:52,340
Rest in glitch phase!

2597
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:53,720
Moi-moi-cune!

2598
03:02:54,780 --> 03:02:55,420
Have fun!

2599
03:02:55,680 --> 03:02:56,580
Have fun with your friend!

2600
03:02:57,020 --> 03:02:58,480
Wait, why are there so many pills?

2601
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:00,280
Why are there three pills?

2602
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:04,560
I'm gonna go save.

2603
03:03:07,980 --> 03:03:09,120
I'm gonna go save.

2604
03:03:09,620 --> 03:03:10,580
Then they will come get them.

2605
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:15,020
It's a bad sign.

2606
03:03:15,220 --> 03:03:18,080
If that's 100% like the worst sign you could give me.

2607
03:03:20,100 --> 03:03:20,640
Free health?

2608
03:03:20,860 --> 03:03:21,140
No.

2609
03:03:21,640 --> 03:03:23,120
No, no, no, no.

2610
03:03:23,920 --> 03:03:26,480
Ah, no, no, no, no, no.

2611
03:03:26,980 --> 03:03:28,000
No, no, no.

2612
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:34,840
Absolutely not.

2613
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:36,300
We're going to come back for him.

2614
03:03:37,660 --> 03:03:41,240
But first, since I did all that work, I want to...

2615
03:03:41,240 --> 03:03:43,320
I want to save.

2616
03:03:43,880 --> 03:03:45,140
I'm save scumming a little bit.

2617
03:03:48,460 --> 03:03:48,980
Okay.

2618
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:51,140
Yippee!

2619
03:03:53,120 --> 03:03:53,820
Okay.

2620
03:03:56,820 --> 03:03:59,140
Did I read the newspaper I just passed?

2621
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:00,300
Let me see.

2622
03:04:01,020 --> 03:04:01,900
This one?

2623
03:04:03,140 --> 03:04:03,980
Wait, I don't see this.

2624
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:08,440
Okay.

2625
03:04:09,260 --> 03:04:11,460
Alright, let's go, uh...

2626
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:13,660
Let's go see the damage.

2627
03:04:14,860 --> 03:04:15,680
Oh, this one?

2628
03:04:17,740 --> 03:04:18,940
Oh, but I...

2629
03:04:19,780 --> 03:04:21,020
I don't need this anymore.

2630
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:21,260
anymore?

2631
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:23,040
I already got the...

2632
03:04:23,780 --> 03:04:25,040
I already got the key.

2633
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:35,980
Who's gonna ambush me?

2634
03:04:36,700 --> 03:04:38,240
In fact, maybe we'll do that.

2635
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:41,280
Because these guys are pretty fast.

2636
03:04:41,400 --> 03:04:43,880
If I'm not fast enough, either, you know?

2637
03:04:46,820 --> 03:04:49,480
That one, that one for sure is like the trap.

2638
03:04:51,440 --> 03:04:53,020
I don't see anything around.

2639
03:04:53,620 --> 03:04:55,100
This one's gotta be the trap.

2640
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:58,680
I pick it up and like the guys spawn behind me or something.

2641
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:03,280
I was busy on my birthday on Thursday, so I'm wishing all the best today.

2642
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:04,940
Zikai, happy birthday!

2643
03:05:05,720 --> 03:05:06,500
Happy, happy birthday!

2644
03:05:10,310 --> 03:05:11,910
We have eight pills!

2645
03:05:12,110 --> 03:05:13,590
We don't need it, right?

2646
03:05:26,930 --> 03:05:27,370
Nothing?

2647
03:05:30,010 --> 03:05:30,850
No, what?

2648
03:05:31,610 --> 03:05:31,950
What?

2649
03:05:36,790 --> 03:05:37,650
Ah, a comb.

2650
03:05:38,070 --> 03:05:41,710
I wish I had seen that before I went to go save.

2651
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:48,750
Feels like a boss room.

2652
03:05:48,890 --> 03:05:50,450
As soon as I, like, step across this threshold.

2653
03:05:51,590 --> 03:05:51,850
Nothing?

2654
03:05:56,480 --> 03:05:57,260
None, that's so.

2655
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:10,720
Okay.

2656
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:22,360
Okay.

2657
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:29,340
Expectations subverted for real.

2658
03:06:30,380 --> 03:06:32,320
The game is just messing with us, isn't it?

2659
03:06:32,920 --> 03:06:34,420
I'm gonna go sell this comb.

2660
03:06:37,760 --> 03:06:39,380
I'm gonna go sell it.

2661
03:06:41,980 --> 03:06:45,640
Because we need as much inventory as we can.

2662
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:51,940
We're at 600!

2663
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:53,060
Wait, we could...

2664
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:56,820
Should we do like an Omamori gacha?

2665
03:06:57,220 --> 03:06:59,640
Or I could also increase my abilities.

2666
03:07:01,880 --> 03:07:03,620
I could get more health.

2667
03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:16,170
I would have really liked more of this stuff.

2668
03:07:17,410 --> 03:07:18,450
Like this part of the game?

2669
03:07:19,750 --> 03:07:20,990
Yeah, I really like this.

2670
03:07:21,010 --> 03:07:22,230
It makes me...

2671
03:07:22,230 --> 03:07:25,350
This is like the scariest part of the game so far.

2672
03:07:25,630 --> 03:07:28,910
In just terms of like atmosphere and how paranoid I am and everything.

2673
03:07:29,710 --> 03:07:32,690
I definitely think atmosphere stuff is my favorite.

2674
03:07:33,290 --> 03:07:35,790
So that's why I really like this.

2675
03:07:35,890 --> 03:07:43,060
And I'm kind of lukewarm on the combat.

2676
03:07:53,830 --> 03:07:54,430
Okay.

2677
03:07:55,750 --> 03:07:57,570
We made it.

2678
03:07:57,570 --> 03:07:59,090
We made it.

2679
03:07:59,570 --> 03:07:59,790
Ah!

2680
03:08:01,530 --> 03:08:02,130
Back...

2681
03:08:02,130 --> 03:08:03,790
Key to the back mountains.

2682
03:08:05,530 --> 03:08:05,870
Alrighty.

2683
03:08:06,170 --> 03:08:07,330
Head back to Shu and Ninko!

2684
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:15,700
I'm just gonna run.

2685
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:24,080
This area is unaffected.

2686
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:25,580
Why?

2687
03:08:28,700 --> 03:08:29,300
Uh...

2688
03:08:29,300 --> 03:08:30,280
Oops, wrong door.

2689
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:31,820
Wait, where is it this one?

2690
03:08:31,960 --> 03:08:33,920
Oh, is this one?

2691
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:38,980
I knew they were gonna be talking smack about me.

2692
03:08:39,320 --> 03:08:39,320
What?

2693
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:39,960
What?

2694
03:08:46,640 --> 03:08:48,140
Femme Fatal!

2695
03:08:49,180 --> 03:08:50,260
You wish.

2696
03:09:17,940 --> 03:09:19,300
Oh really?

2697
03:09:23,940 --> 03:09:24,280
Really?

2698
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:26,480
Wait, why are you guys leaving?

2699
03:09:29,120 --> 03:09:29,640
Wait, what?

2700
03:09:29,980 --> 03:09:36,080
Okay, it's time to go to dreams of Foxy's Foxy guy.

2701
03:09:41,640 --> 03:09:43,720
Why is she always talking smack about me?

2702
03:09:45,140 --> 03:09:46,380
Kyo me neo.

2703
03:09:56,890 --> 03:09:58,030
So creepy.

2704
03:09:58,470 --> 03:09:59,330
Shell of the past.

2705
03:09:59,430 --> 03:10:00,950
What exactly have we learned?

2706
03:10:08,950 --> 03:10:11,830
I feel like I'm gonna sneeze again.

2707
03:10:12,990 --> 03:10:13,490
Oh?

2708
03:10:20,240 --> 03:10:22,660
Wait, what?

2709
03:10:24,860 --> 03:10:25,280
Wait, what?

2710
03:10:29,460 --> 03:10:29,720
Oh!

2711
03:10:31,580 --> 03:10:33,360
His mask wasn't on.

2712
03:10:39,030 --> 03:10:39,950
Face reveal?

2713
03:10:40,830 --> 03:10:41,610
Docs yourself!

2714
03:10:41,950 --> 03:10:42,610
Docs yourself!

2715
03:10:53,780 --> 03:10:56,300
Oh my gosh, am I sleeping in his lap?

2716
03:10:58,380 --> 03:10:58,780
Whoa!

2717
03:11:04,500 --> 03:11:06,960
I forgot you guys could hear that.

2718
03:11:16,280 --> 03:11:16,680
Sorry.

2719
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,000
She's so cute.

2720
03:11:23,180 --> 03:11:24,740
Oh yeah, we drank the fire water.

2721
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:27,360
Oh my gosh, I need to blow my nose.

2722
03:11:27,980 --> 03:11:28,660
Bad, bad.

2723
03:11:32,140 --> 03:11:33,800
I'll do it after.

2724
03:11:35,260 --> 03:11:40,640
Head part.

2725
03:11:46,240 --> 03:11:46,610
Yeah?

2726
03:11:51,580 --> 03:11:52,320
Yeah?

2727
03:11:52,520 --> 03:11:54,340
Don't laugh at me!

2728
03:11:58,620 --> 03:11:59,920
What is...

2729
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:01,580
It's like Vader drunk.

2730
03:12:02,880 --> 03:12:03,320
Oh.

2731
03:12:04,380 --> 03:12:05,720
We're finally going in.

2732
03:12:06,960 --> 03:12:08,400
I gotta blow my nose.

2733
03:12:08,520 --> 03:12:09,360
I don't have any tissue.

2734
03:12:10,220 --> 03:12:11,680
Too much ectopatism.

2735
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:28,560
I think I trust our doll more than trust this guy.

2736
03:12:28,760 --> 03:12:30,380
But honestly, do we have another choice?

2737
03:12:31,260 --> 03:12:31,960
Isn't this the guy?

2738
03:12:32,120 --> 03:12:34,340
Like, the notes all said, like, He knock always mine.

2739
03:12:34,520 --> 03:12:35,320
Mine, mine, mine.

2740
03:12:36,140 --> 03:12:36,900
Mine, mine, mine.

2741
03:12:41,550 --> 03:12:42,950
I don't trust this guy at all.

2742
03:12:47,740 --> 03:12:53,840
I know a lot of people said that they kind of, like, called, I guess, whatever the twist is of this story pretty early on.

2743
03:12:54,400 --> 03:12:54,820
But...

2744
03:12:55,540 --> 03:13:00,560
Uh, I'm just, I try not to, sometimes I try not to just, like, theorize.

2745
03:13:00,700 --> 03:13:03,200
I like to just kind of let the game take me on the ride.

2746
03:13:03,540 --> 03:13:07,400
So, I honestly haven't really thought much about it.

2747
03:13:07,800 --> 03:13:08,160
Hold on, though.

2748
03:13:08,200 --> 03:13:09,080
Let me go get some tissue.

2749
03:13:09,580 --> 03:13:10,620
I'm sorry, guys.

2750
03:13:10,900 --> 03:13:12,420
I keep having to leave you all.

2751
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:14,380
I had tissue in here, though.

2752
03:13:15,020 --> 03:13:17,180
I just don't know where I put it.

2753
03:13:19,520 --> 03:13:23,820
My room's not even messy, so I'm like, where could I have put it?

2754
03:13:26,860 --> 03:13:28,120
Okay, let me go.

2755
03:13:28,360 --> 03:13:29,520
Let me go grab a tissue.

2756
03:13:52,800 --> 03:13:53,240
Okay.

2757
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:55,520
I'll grab a tissue pack.

2758
03:13:57,200 --> 03:13:57,460
Oh!

2759
03:13:58,480 --> 03:14:01,400
I tore it, but it, like, didn't tear properly.

2760
03:14:03,280 --> 03:14:03,620
Alright.

2761
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:09,320
I'm not too smart at figuring stuff earlier than, like, one minute before it's revealed.

2762
03:14:09,620 --> 03:14:10,280
That's okay.

2763
03:14:11,440 --> 03:14:13,360
Sometimes it's just fine to live in the moment.

2764
03:14:13,620 --> 03:14:15,860
And, like, you know, just experience it in the moment.

2765
03:14:23,220 --> 03:14:40,080
I'm handling the fox guy better than most other vtubers I've seen even if you are sort of into him it's not that I'm into him it's not I'm into lap pillows and he not goes very cute so seeing her in the lap pillow makes me be like yippee

2766
03:14:47,990 --> 03:14:54,030
sorry I'm muting for me with my nose okay let's go let's follow this guy

2767
03:14:57,070 --> 03:14:58,530

03:15:02,530 --> 03:15:27,370

2769
03:15:31,630 --> 03:15:31,810
hold on.

2770
03:15:31,930 --> 03:15:33,010
Let me look it up real quick.

2771
03:15:33,770 --> 03:15:36,670
I remember the name, but I don't remember anything else about it.

2772
03:15:36,830 --> 03:15:37,400
Wait, hold on.

2773
03:15:38,790 --> 03:15:39,210
One second.

2774
03:15:39,690 --> 03:15:40,190
Fuan.

2775
03:15:40,950 --> 03:15:41,970
Fuan no tan.

2776
03:15:44,930 --> 03:15:45,510
Yes!

2777
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:50,450
Whoa.

2778
03:15:52,710 --> 03:15:55,290
It's like a series of short stories.

2779
03:15:56,470 --> 03:15:57,050
Okay.

2780
03:15:58,230 --> 03:15:59,210
I remember.

2781
03:16:03,680 --> 03:16:06,240
This is the part where I felt the game's quality was dropping.

2782
03:16:06,540 --> 03:16:06,820
Oh no!

2783
03:16:07,340 --> 03:16:09,740
I guess the school section was so good.

2784
03:16:12,340 --> 03:16:12,880
But...

2785
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:15,080
Like, I really, really enjoyed that part.

2786
03:16:15,500 --> 03:16:15,660
Oh.

2787
03:16:16,100 --> 03:16:17,920
So, the door can't be opened.

2788
03:16:18,080 --> 03:16:18,900
Okay, good to know.

2789
03:16:20,440 --> 03:16:22,120
Just telling me how, alright?

2790
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:23,580
Oh.

2791
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:27,140
I think I found a way to open it.

2792
03:16:27,940 --> 03:16:28,840
Open something.

2793
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:29,160
Wait.

2794
03:16:29,200 --> 03:16:31,120
I found a, uh, I opened something.

2795
03:16:32,920 --> 03:16:34,240
Go through the door.

2796
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:35,360
Okay, chill.

2797
03:16:36,260 --> 03:16:37,260
Hold on.

2798
03:16:40,060 --> 03:16:41,060
KFP raid?

2799
03:16:41,220 --> 03:16:41,980
Oh my gosh!

2800
03:16:42,200 --> 03:16:43,420
Wait, I missed it!

2801
03:16:44,080 --> 03:16:45,560
Why KFP?

2802
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:46,540
Hello!

2803
03:16:48,020 --> 03:16:48,800
Hello, hello!

2804
03:16:50,300 --> 03:16:50,960
Wait, actually?

2805
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:53,220
Did I miss it?

2806
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:02,170
Where did that door open up?

2807
03:17:03,970 --> 03:17:04,570
Oh.

2808
03:17:04,890 --> 03:17:05,590
Damn.

2809
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:12,260
Aha.

2810
03:17:13,220 --> 03:17:13,680
Oh.

2811
03:17:15,820 --> 03:17:16,660
Gosh.

2812
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:19,700
Explore the area.

2813
03:17:20,040 --> 03:17:22,040
What the hecky?

2814
03:17:22,240 --> 03:17:24,680
I like how both of these guys are like,

2815
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:40,400
Kikiriki, Kipirin!

2816
03:17:41,380 --> 03:17:42,220
Kikiriki!

2817
03:17:43,340 --> 03:17:45,360
Thank you, STM2.

2818
03:17:45,380 --> 03:17:45,960
Thank you so much for the game.

2819
03:17:45,980 --> 03:17:52,200
I don't

2820
03:17:57,410 --> 03:17:58,630
want to go in there.

2821
03:18:03,050 --> 03:18:04,390
I don't think I want to go in there.

2822
03:18:06,030 --> 03:18:07,470
It was a manual raid.

2823
03:18:08,110 --> 03:18:09,210
Oh, thank you.

2824
03:18:09,750 --> 03:18:10,410
Thanks for coming.

2825
03:18:13,270 --> 03:18:13,530
Whoa.

2826
03:18:14,570 --> 03:18:15,630
Phil, thank you so much for the vibe.

2827
03:18:15,890 --> 03:18:16,050
Get in.

2828
03:18:16,530 --> 03:18:17,590
Welcome in, everybody.

2829
03:18:18,330 --> 03:18:20,690
I'm playing Silent Hill F.

2830
03:18:20,690 --> 03:18:21,850
It's pretty spooky.

2831
03:18:24,110 --> 03:18:24,670
What is this?

2832
03:18:25,350 --> 03:18:26,050
I'm just touching.

2833
03:18:26,190 --> 03:18:27,630
Okay, we're just pulling levers.

2834
03:18:29,550 --> 03:18:31,190
I'm just touching stuff.

2835
03:18:32,450 --> 03:18:33,550
I see, I see.

2836
03:18:33,790 --> 03:18:34,430
So whatever.

2837
03:18:35,370 --> 03:18:36,630
Ah, okay, okay.

2838
03:18:36,990 --> 03:18:38,210
It's one of these types of puzzles.

2839
03:18:46,670 --> 03:18:49,370
Find the missing object to fit in the device.

2840
03:18:49,850 --> 03:18:50,210
Wait!

2841
03:18:51,090 --> 03:18:52,230
Are we going to lower wrinkles?

2842
03:18:54,470 --> 03:18:57,310
Lower Rinko into the fires where she belongs!

2843
03:18:58,470 --> 03:18:59,990
Dorico, thank you so much for the vibe, get this!

2844
03:19:00,590 --> 03:19:01,490
Thank you!

2845
03:19:10,270 --> 03:19:11,030
Okay.

2846
03:19:13,110 --> 03:19:14,690
What is this now?

2847
03:19:18,240 --> 03:19:18,620
Oh!

2848
03:19:18,900 --> 03:19:19,460
Just kidding.

2849
03:19:21,420 --> 03:19:21,920
Yippee!

2850
03:19:23,080 --> 03:19:25,500
I still can...

2851
03:19:26,540 --> 03:19:27,700
upgrade something.

2852
03:19:29,500 --> 03:19:33,160
I'm so mad I didn't get that carcass in the yard.

2853
03:19:35,220 --> 03:19:35,780
Ow!

2854
03:19:37,060 --> 03:19:39,260
Okay, so red is open currently.

2855
03:19:40,420 --> 03:19:40,620
Okay.

2856
03:19:42,220 --> 03:19:42,780
Yes.

2857
03:19:46,690 --> 03:19:48,130
Oh, and so is green.

2858
03:19:48,370 --> 03:19:49,910
Actually, maybe I don't know how this works.

2859
03:19:52,250 --> 03:19:55,570
I hope I didn't open the door for that thing.

2860
03:19:55,950 --> 03:19:56,370
Oh!

2861
03:19:56,950 --> 03:19:58,230
Oh, I don't like that.

2862
03:19:59,330 --> 03:19:59,890
Okay.

2863
03:20:02,690 --> 03:20:04,150
I'm being brave.

2864
03:20:05,810 --> 03:20:06,650
Lala lava.

2865
03:20:07,830 --> 03:20:08,450
Binko.

2866
03:20:08,950 --> 03:20:09,290
All right.

2867
03:20:09,410 --> 03:20:10,630
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

2868
03:20:11,290 --> 03:20:12,570
Thank you so much.

2869
03:20:12,850 --> 03:20:13,370
Oh, jeez.

2870
03:20:13,930 --> 03:20:14,320
Be careful.

2871
03:20:17,250 --> 03:20:18,350
Lala lava.

2872
03:20:20,030 --> 03:20:20,650
Rinko.

2873
03:20:29,750 --> 03:20:30,230
Oh.

2874
03:20:31,330 --> 03:20:31,950
Oh.

2875
03:20:32,290 --> 03:20:32,490
Oh.

2876
03:20:33,290 --> 03:20:33,570
Oh.

2877
03:20:34,430 --> 03:20:34,550
Oh.

2878
03:20:34,610 --> 03:20:35,030
Oh.

2879
03:20:35,030 --> 03:20:35,110
Oh.

2880
03:20:35,250 --> 03:20:35,510
Oh.

2881
03:20:35,790 --> 03:20:36,410
Oh.

2882
03:20:36,410 --> 03:20:36,590
Oh.

2883
03:20:36,590 --> 03:20:36,910
Oh.

2884
03:20:37,530 --> 03:20:37,570
Oh.

2885
03:20:43,950 --> 03:20:45,490
Why do I feel like my...

2886
03:20:48,550 --> 03:20:50,490
Thing doesn't like...

2887
03:20:52,570 --> 03:20:53,970
Load so fast anymore.

2888
03:20:54,270 --> 03:20:54,610
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2889
03:20:54,810 --> 03:20:55,970
Oh my gosh, she's tough.

2890
03:20:57,270 --> 03:20:57,390
Woo!

2891
03:20:58,530 --> 03:21:00,710
Oh gosh, I'm trying to walk on you please!

2892
03:21:03,590 --> 03:21:04,030
Ouch!

2893
03:21:04,490 --> 03:21:05,390
Oh my gosh!

2894
03:21:15,100 --> 03:21:15,980
Oh, okay.

2895
03:21:16,460 --> 03:21:18,220
Oh, she's down but like not out.

2896
03:21:18,400 --> 03:21:19,500
Oh no, okay.

2897
03:21:20,120 --> 03:21:22,160
Oh, things don't truly die here.

2898
03:21:22,820 --> 03:21:24,280
Oh, gosh, that was spooky scary.

2899
03:21:25,100 --> 03:21:25,380
Okay.

2900
03:21:26,420 --> 03:21:26,900
What's this?

2901
03:21:26,980 --> 03:21:27,740
First aid kit?

2902
03:21:27,860 --> 03:21:28,520
Thank you.

2903
03:21:28,980 --> 03:21:30,040
How's my...

2904
03:21:30,900 --> 03:21:31,400
Wait.

2905
03:21:35,160 --> 03:21:35,980
Oh, wait.

2906
03:21:36,140 --> 03:21:37,500
I don't have the...

2907
03:21:39,180 --> 03:21:41,140
I don't have my knife anymore.

2908
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:44,700
Wait, did my...

2909
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:45,700
Was that my knife?

2910
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:47,160
What?

2911
03:21:47,520 --> 03:21:47,780
Wait.

2912
03:21:50,240 --> 03:21:51,100
Oh, it's...

2913
03:21:51,100 --> 03:21:51,300
Whatever.

2914
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:54,420
Oh, that's why I was like, why is it so...

2915
03:21:54,420 --> 03:21:56,200
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2916
03:21:59,100 --> 03:22:00,600
Oinari is Sama's emblem.

2917
03:22:03,060 --> 03:22:03,800
All right.

2918
03:22:04,420 --> 03:22:05,180
Different dimension.

2919
03:22:05,340 --> 03:22:06,600
Yeah, so different weapons.

2920
03:22:07,280 --> 03:22:09,900
Ah, I was like, wait, there's not even like a...

2921
03:22:09,900 --> 03:22:11,180
What's it called thing though?

2922
03:22:13,920 --> 03:22:14,380
This...

2923
03:22:16,940 --> 03:22:17,840
My brain.

2924
03:22:18,280 --> 03:22:18,820
My brain.

2925
03:22:23,240 --> 03:22:23,700
Durability.

2926
03:22:24,180 --> 03:22:25,280
Yes, I kept wanting to say so.

2927
03:22:25,300 --> 03:22:25,700
stamina.

2928
03:22:26,060 --> 03:22:27,220
I knew that was wrong.

2929
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:30,820
Alright, let's go this way.

2930
03:22:40,400 --> 03:22:41,640
Let's go this way.

2931
03:22:48,710 --> 03:22:48,930
Oh!

2932
03:22:52,050 --> 03:22:52,690
What?

2933
03:22:57,710 --> 03:22:58,350
Aha!

2934
03:22:59,530 --> 03:23:00,430
I see!

2935
03:23:01,850 --> 03:23:02,490
Okay.

2936
03:23:03,290 --> 03:23:04,090
Oh, man.

2937
03:23:04,250 --> 03:23:06,930
I think that's the blunt blunt bled from the first time you were here.

2938
03:23:07,490 --> 03:23:08,030
Probably.

2939
03:23:08,990 --> 03:23:09,470
That's why

2940
03:23:13,150 --> 03:23:14,770
Wait, that's me!

2941
03:23:15,070 --> 03:23:16,010
I'm the baby!

2942
03:23:16,190 --> 03:23:17,150
I'm the baby!

2943
03:23:18,630 --> 03:23:18,850
Anyway.

2944
03:23:21,150 --> 03:23:23,230
I'm the baby, I'm the baby.

2945
03:23:27,530 --> 03:23:28,250
Oh, gosh.

2946
03:23:31,190 --> 03:23:33,470
Let's go through here because I can.

2947
03:23:33,810 --> 03:23:33,990
Wait.

2948
03:23:36,930 --> 03:23:38,490
Oh, that's the other thing.

2949
03:23:38,810 --> 03:23:38,970
Okay.

2950
03:23:48,400 --> 03:23:49,000
Whoa.

2951
03:23:54,490 --> 03:23:55,690
Rinko's room?

2952
03:23:56,530 --> 03:23:57,870
I'm gonna steal her stuff.

2953
03:23:58,930 --> 03:24:00,290
We're in Rinko's room?

2954
03:24:02,490 --> 03:24:04,090
Why she got a bunch of dolls?

2955
03:24:05,570 --> 03:24:06,710
Oh my god, Rinko's smell.

2956
03:24:07,190 --> 03:24:07,850
Rinko bed.

2957
03:24:15,040 --> 03:24:18,400
Like, how quiet it is in here with just the clock.

2958
03:24:20,740 --> 03:24:21,880
No thank you.

2959
03:24:22,520 --> 03:24:23,560
No thank you.

2960
03:24:27,850 --> 03:24:28,630
Prumpled letter.

2961
03:24:29,090 --> 03:24:30,790
for writing you a letter out of the blue.

2962
03:24:31,770 --> 03:24:35,090
I know we could just talk at school, but when I'm around you, I always end up...

2963
03:24:37,370 --> 03:24:37,810
beheaded.

2964
03:24:39,150 --> 03:24:40,410
Whoever wrote it stopped here.

2965
03:24:41,570 --> 03:24:46,130
Hey, I know this is really last minute, but would you mind coming shopping with me on Sunday?

2966
03:24:46,230 --> 03:24:48,430
I want to know what clothes would look cute on me.

2967
03:24:48,530 --> 03:24:50,110
From a boy's perspective, that is.

2968
03:24:50,450 --> 03:24:51,210
What do you think?

2969
03:24:51,910 --> 03:24:53,830
The letter ends here abruptly.

2970
03:24:55,130 --> 03:24:56,650
I love you so much.

2971
03:24:56,690 --> 03:24:58,430
You never leave my thoughts.

2972
03:24:59,090 --> 03:25:00,090
Rinko.

2973
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:07,000
Girl!

2974
03:25:09,640 --> 03:25:10,340
Girl!

2975
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:17,040
Should have written it in numbers.

2976
03:25:18,440 --> 03:25:19,180
Or Seifuku.

2977
03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:23,140
Alright.

2978
03:25:23,740 --> 03:25:24,620
Let's grab the thing.

2979
03:25:25,960 --> 03:25:26,040
Oh.

2980
03:25:27,400 --> 03:25:28,840
Rinko collects dolls?

2981
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:32,740
Rinko's got a spooky hobby.

2982
03:25:32,980 --> 03:25:33,720
Don't like that.

2983
03:25:34,380 --> 03:25:35,400
What are we doing?

2984
03:25:37,540 --> 03:25:37,740
What?

2985
03:25:38,040 --> 03:25:38,280
Hi!

2986
03:25:39,260 --> 03:25:40,400
Oh, red means scary.

2987
03:25:44,170 --> 03:25:44,750
What's that?

2988
03:25:49,920 --> 03:25:51,300
What did I do?

2989
03:25:51,860 --> 03:25:52,960
I guess I just opened the door?

2990
03:25:54,660 --> 03:25:55,800
Made it so I could get back out?

2991
03:25:55,880 --> 03:25:58,080
Why is it so musty in here?

2992
03:25:59,220 --> 03:26:00,980
Girl, don't you wash your sheets?

2993
03:26:01,640 --> 03:26:02,120
Your futon?

2994
03:26:03,480 --> 03:26:04,220
Come on!

2995
03:26:08,310 --> 03:26:09,530
Why is it so...

2996
03:26:10,610 --> 03:26:11,650
Stinky!

2997
03:26:13,070 --> 03:26:13,410
Oh wait.

2998
03:26:14,630 --> 03:26:14,770
Oh.

2999
03:26:17,770 --> 03:26:19,030
Things are different now.

3000
03:26:26,140 --> 03:26:26,320
Oh.

3001
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:31,340
I'm back here!

3002
03:26:32,060 --> 03:26:32,760
What?

3003
03:26:40,320 --> 03:26:41,120
What the heck?

3004
03:26:48,330 --> 03:26:48,570
What?

3005
03:26:50,730 --> 03:26:51,890
A

3006
03:26:56,330 --> 03:26:58,090
puzzle is a foot.

3007
03:26:59,370 --> 03:26:59,750

3012
03:27:54,610 --> 03:27:55,250
Yes.

Oh, what's in here?

3014
03:27:59,430 --> 03:27:59,670

Shit, shit.

3017

3020
03:28:20,230 --> 03:28:21,190
Oh my gosh.

3021
03:28:21,290 --> 03:28:21,770
I should have died.

3022
03:28:21,890 --> 03:28:22,430
Just my bad.

3023
03:28:23,870 --> 03:28:24,950
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3024
03:28:25,130 --> 03:28:25,490
I'm gonna die.

3025
03:28:25,610 --> 03:28:26,310
I'm gonna die!

3026
03:28:32,580 --> 03:28:33,280
It's okay.

3027
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:35,040
Now we know.

3028
03:28:35,660 --> 03:28:36,380
Now we know.

3029
03:28:38,140 --> 03:28:39,100
Oh, okay.

3030
03:28:43,600 --> 03:28:45,960
I did not handle that well at all.

3031
03:28:49,580 --> 03:28:53,080
But maybe this thing is not where I need it to be now.

3032
03:28:53,260 --> 03:28:54,080
Maybe it's somewhere else.

3033
03:28:56,800 --> 03:28:57,640
Just kidding.

3034
03:28:59,860 --> 03:29:00,620
Oh my god!

3035
03:29:07,360 --> 03:29:07,880
Oh,

3036
03:29:24,250 --> 03:29:24,730
my stamina.

3037
03:29:31,940 --> 03:29:33,160
Okay, come here.

3038
03:29:35,320 --> 03:29:36,700
You have- Oh my gosh!

3039
03:29:36,900 --> 03:29:37,540
Oh my gosh, okay.

3040
03:29:42,460 --> 03:29:42,980
Ah!

3041
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:44,520
She gets me before I can get her!

3042
03:29:47,300 --> 03:29:47,820
Yeah!

3043
03:29:48,040 --> 03:29:49,160
One for extra pleasure.

3044
03:29:50,720 --> 03:29:51,840
Is it dead?

3045
03:29:53,020 --> 03:29:53,920
I don't think truly.

3046
03:29:54,320 --> 03:29:56,340
Oh, I don't like these areas, though.

3047
03:29:58,200 --> 03:29:59,020
This part.

3048
03:29:59,300 --> 03:30:00,380
I don't like it.

3049
03:30:01,580 --> 03:30:03,320
Okay, let's go back into the room.

3050
03:30:04,260 --> 03:30:04,800
One second.

3051
03:30:06,580 --> 03:30:07,060
Yeah.

3052
03:30:09,100 --> 03:30:10,580
Wait, do I need to do it all over again?

3053
03:30:13,800 --> 03:30:14,280
No.

3054
03:30:15,060 --> 03:30:15,540
Okay.

3055
03:30:29,650 --> 03:30:30,130
Okay.

3056
03:30:30,950 --> 03:30:32,250
So I have to find the thing.

3057
03:30:32,450 --> 03:30:34,950
Probably, but...

3058
03:30:34,950 --> 03:30:35,830
Is it in the doll?

3059
03:30:36,170 --> 03:30:36,330
No?

3060
03:30:36,530 --> 03:30:37,170
Oh, what about you?

3061
03:30:38,450 --> 03:30:38,790
Oh!

3062
03:30:40,210 --> 03:30:40,550
Eww!

3063
03:30:44,310 --> 03:30:44,650
Okay.

3064
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:50,520
Is it in one of these dolls?

3065
03:30:51,020 --> 03:30:52,620
Is it in you?

3066
03:30:55,220 --> 03:30:55,900
Eww!

3067
03:30:57,140 --> 03:30:57,820
Oh!

3068
03:30:58,380 --> 03:30:59,040
Oh no!

3069
03:30:59,740 --> 03:31:00,460
Oh no!

3070
03:31:02,340 --> 03:31:03,360
Oh my god!

3071
03:31:03,820 --> 03:31:05,120

3072
03:31:05,960 --> 03:31:07,400

We got one.

3076
03:31:59,640 --> 03:32:00,560
Out of three.

3077
03:32:02,800 --> 03:32:03,460
Thank you.

3078
03:32:06,100 --> 03:32:07,980

03:32:11,300 --> 03:32:12,680
Now they're...

3081
03:32:12,680 --> 03:32:13,080
Me?

3082
03:32:15,160 --> 03:32:17,200
It says die.

3083
03:32:17,420 --> 03:32:18,520

3086
03:32:51,360 --> 03:32:53,480
but could you keep your distance from Shu?

3087
03:32:57,960 --> 03:32:58,320
Yay!

3088
03:33:06,030 --> 03:33:08,790
I know this is none of my business, but could you keep your distance from Shu?

3089
03:33:08,950 --> 03:33:14,770
You know, people tend to get the wrong idea when boys and girls are aged, spend too much time together, and you don't want to cause any issues for Shu, do you?

3090
03:33:15,430 --> 03:33:17,730
You should really think more about how you beha.

3091
03:33:18,530 --> 03:33:19,630
Beha, beha, beha.

3092
03:33:21,810 --> 03:33:23,170
You are nothing but a fly.

3093
03:33:23,330 --> 03:33:24,290
All you do is get in the way.

3094
03:33:24,450 --> 03:33:25,130
Get lost.

3095
03:33:27,410 --> 03:33:48,650

03:33:51,430 --> 03:33:52,510
Oh, we're a man!

3097
03:33:53,190 --> 03:33:53,910
Not even a man.

3098
03:33:54,090 --> 03:33:54,610
A boy!

3099
03:33:56,690 --> 03:33:57,990
Oh, we're a boy!

3100
03:34:00,130 --> 03:34:02,170
Girl, get it together.

3101
03:34:02,810 --> 03:34:03,430
Oh,

3103
03:34:15,800 --> 03:34:15,800
Nice.

3104
03:34:19,420 --> 03:34:20,420
Oh, my god.

3105
03:34:20,720 --> 03:34:20,820
Ah!

3106
03:34:22,460 --> 03:34:24,080
That was so mean.

3107
03:34:24,540 --> 03:34:26,380
That was so mean!

3108
03:34:34,560 --> 03:34:35,200
I don't know.

3109
03:34:35,380 --> 03:34:36,280
Oh, lock on please.

3110
03:34:36,480 --> 03:34:36,860
Where is she?

3111
03:34:38,220 --> 03:34:38,720
Oh my god.

3112
03:34:39,060 --> 03:34:39,060
Oh.

3113
03:34:40,760 --> 03:34:41,420
Ouch, I'll choke.

3114
03:34:42,060 --> 03:34:45,200
I don't know why I'm not very good at these ones.

3115
03:34:45,380 --> 03:34:46,720
I'm so bad at fighting them.

3116
03:34:50,940 --> 03:34:54,960
I just gotta remember they're like the things on the outside just worse.

3117
03:34:57,440 --> 03:34:58,360
Whoop, whoop, I have no stamina!

3118
03:34:58,600 --> 03:34:59,900
And I have one HP in a dream.

3119
03:35:00,560 --> 03:35:01,420
It's fine if I die.

3120
03:35:02,300 --> 03:35:02,660
Honestly.

3121
03:35:03,320 --> 03:35:05,160
Oh, thank you for the rain!

3122
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:07,260
Thank you, thank you.

3123
03:35:09,760 --> 03:35:10,720
Oh, gosh.

3124
03:35:11,980 --> 03:35:13,720
I'm so bad at them.

3125
03:35:15,880 --> 03:35:17,880
Well, it auto-saved, so I guess we're fine.

3126
03:35:18,200 --> 03:35:19,260
Let me...

3127
03:35:20,760 --> 03:35:21,080
Deal.

3128
03:35:23,820 --> 03:35:24,160
Okay.

3129
03:35:25,640 --> 03:35:26,580
And put this on.

3130
03:35:31,080 --> 03:35:32,060
Is it gonna lower?

3131
03:35:32,200 --> 03:35:32,420
Oh!

3132
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:40,480
Helped?

3133
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:42,360
Helped me?

3134
03:35:46,840 --> 03:35:47,120
Okay.

3135
03:35:49,160 --> 03:35:50,760
Alright, so we went through there.

3136
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:58,500
So now I need to switch it to the white rabbit, maybe, and we can go over to there.

3137
03:36:02,560 --> 03:36:03,860
Oh, wait, but actually...

3138
03:36:08,160 --> 03:36:08,980
Oh, how do I...

3139
03:36:08,980 --> 03:36:09,380
Oh, yeah.

3140
03:36:09,960 --> 03:36:11,240
change it to the white rabbit.

3141
03:36:11,620 --> 03:36:11,860
Oh wait!

3142
03:36:12,040 --> 03:36:12,040
No!

3143
03:36:12,260 --> 03:36:13,540
Oh wait, I have to do it inside there.

3144
03:36:13,800 --> 03:36:14,120
Okay, okay, okay.

3145
03:36:14,800 --> 03:36:15,320
Inside the temple.

3146
03:36:15,640 --> 03:36:15,760
Okay, okay.

3147
03:36:28,290 --> 03:36:30,290
Okay, and we're gonna get ambushed again.

3148
03:36:31,570 --> 03:36:33,490
Oh, it's up there.

3149
03:36:33,690 --> 03:36:33,890
I see.

3150
03:36:34,010 --> 03:36:35,310
I see like it's attack.

3151
03:36:35,870 --> 03:36:37,790
Ah, can't you leave?

3152
03:36:39,030 --> 03:36:40,570
Can you leave, please?

3153
03:36:41,070 --> 03:36:42,690
Maybe it'll come back down and around.

3154
03:36:46,690 --> 03:36:47,090
Phil,

3155
03:36:50,370 --> 03:36:51,210
thank you so much for the farm.

3156
03:36:51,310 --> 03:36:52,050
Good to thank you.

3157
03:36:53,130 --> 03:36:54,350
We can fight it.

3158
03:36:54,450 --> 03:36:55,030
You think so?

3159
03:36:56,090 --> 03:36:58,330
I guess in this area, it's better to fight, huh?

3160
03:37:00,930 --> 03:37:01,730
All right.

3161
03:37:01,930 --> 03:37:02,330
All right.

3162
03:37:05,960 --> 03:37:06,640
So hold on.

3163
03:37:06,680 --> 03:37:07,780
I'm trying to get my bearings.

3164
03:37:07,980 --> 03:37:09,840
Okay, we keep the red open, which I did.

3165
03:37:10,320 --> 03:37:14,640
And then we do the green for the white rabbit.

3166
03:37:14,840 --> 03:37:15,000
Okay.

3167
03:37:15,160 --> 03:37:16,520
And then we go over in there.

3168
03:37:19,580 --> 03:37:24,700
Well, actually, if I did the bird, I could do that first.

3169
03:37:25,220 --> 03:37:26,300
Let's go do that instead.

3170
03:37:28,380 --> 03:37:29,960
Or, wait, is it coming this way?

3171
03:37:31,100 --> 03:37:32,240
Ooh, spooky!

3172
03:37:33,940 --> 03:37:35,060
So scary!

3173
03:37:38,000 --> 03:37:38,900
Why does it only...

3174
03:37:38,900 --> 03:37:42,820
Oh, walk on one foot.

3175
03:37:48,020 --> 03:37:49,780
It's so nasty.

3176
03:37:55,430 --> 03:37:58,090
Oh, I tried dodging, but I think I was stuck.

3177
03:38:07,050 --> 03:38:07,530
Me too.

3178
03:38:09,390 --> 03:38:10,130
Ouch.

3179
03:38:11,190 --> 03:38:12,450
Stop heading, mate.

3180
03:38:13,630 --> 03:38:15,110
Ouch, out, out, out, out.

3181
03:38:15,930 --> 03:38:16,670
Give me sanity.

3182
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:21,840
Okay, good.

3183
03:38:26,160 --> 03:38:26,900
Okay.

3184
03:38:27,920 --> 03:38:30,760
I guess we'll do this last room then.

3185
03:38:32,120 --> 03:38:33,220
And then we'll do this one.

3186
03:38:37,960 --> 03:38:39,620
Alright, I'm about to be ambushed.

3187
03:38:41,720 --> 03:38:42,700
About to be ambushed.

3188
03:38:44,340 --> 03:38:44,820
Scary.

3189
03:38:45,320 --> 03:38:46,880
I'm scared of being ambushed!

3190
03:38:47,200 --> 03:38:49,560
Oh my gosh, they give me good too!

3191
03:38:53,500 --> 03:38:54,220
Dodge, dodge, dodge!

3192
03:38:54,380 --> 03:38:54,560
Please!

3193
03:38:55,880 --> 03:38:56,520
Oh my god.

3194
03:39:02,510 --> 03:39:03,490
Oh shit, oh shit.

3195
03:39:07,850 --> 03:39:09,070
Wait, did that get it?

3196
03:39:09,190 --> 03:39:09,310
No.

3197
03:39:10,110 --> 03:39:10,390
Wait.

3198
03:39:12,010 --> 03:39:12,690
Oh, it did.

3199
03:39:12,770 --> 03:39:12,970
It did.

3200
03:39:13,090 --> 03:39:13,730
Nice, nice, nice.

3201
03:39:14,490 --> 03:39:15,450
Holy cow.

3202
03:39:17,070 --> 03:39:17,930
Oh, really?

3203
03:39:19,110 --> 03:39:19,550
Already?

3204
03:39:20,730 --> 03:39:21,070
No.

3205
03:39:22,170 --> 03:39:23,030
So unlucky.

3206
03:39:24,610 --> 03:39:29,530
Okay, which means this one will wake up shortly too.

3207
03:39:35,300 --> 03:39:36,040
Oh, Inari-zushi!

3208
03:39:37,460 --> 03:39:39,400
I love Inari-zushi.

3209
03:39:40,140 --> 03:39:40,780
Oh, my gosh.

3210
03:39:40,880 --> 03:39:41,720

and it's not on the other way i guess it wouldn't be on the other side on okay we have to fight it again very nice wait uh uh

3214
03:40:24,320 --> 03:40:41,020
i'm checking what this does again oh greatly restores health okay because i have two of them and i've been holding off just in case what i will do is i will do these instead

3215
03:40:45,920 --> 03:40:46,600
There we go.

3216
03:40:46,800 --> 03:40:46,820
Okay.

3217
03:40:48,240 --> 03:40:48,980
We could run.

3218
03:40:49,560 --> 03:40:49,940
I could.

3219
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:54,800
Actually, it's just around the corner, but I feel like I'm going to get ambushed.

3220
03:40:55,200 --> 03:40:55,320
Wait.

3221
03:40:56,220 --> 03:40:56,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3222
03:40:58,900 --> 03:40:59,360
God.

3223
03:41:00,960 --> 03:41:02,080
Oh, oh, my bad.

3224
03:41:15,340 --> 03:41:16,740
Is there something here?

3225
03:41:17,540 --> 03:41:17,840
Okay.

3226
03:41:18,140 --> 03:41:18,360
No?

3227
03:41:18,680 --> 03:41:19,560
Alright, let's go.

3228
03:41:21,640 --> 03:41:22,260
Oh, shit!

3229
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:36,440
I just like...

3230
03:41:36,520 --> 03:41:38,040
With crazy mode on her.

3231
03:41:40,940 --> 03:41:42,780
All right, nice.

3232
03:41:45,180 --> 03:41:47,880
Oh, I went psycho mode on her.

3233
03:41:48,020 --> 03:41:49,120
I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3234
03:41:51,920 --> 03:41:52,320
Classroom.

3235
03:41:52,920 --> 03:41:54,540
Wait, this is where we were at before.

3236
03:42:01,300 --> 03:42:03,720
That was like 20 minutes ago in the game.

3237
03:42:10,700 --> 03:42:11,600
Okay, my health is all right.

3238
03:42:11,860 --> 03:42:12,680
My health is actually good.

3239
03:42:15,040 --> 03:42:15,620
Stop.

3240
03:42:19,400 --> 03:42:20,700
You're making me depressed.

3241
03:42:21,560 --> 03:42:23,500
I also remember school.

3242
03:42:24,760 --> 03:42:25,500
Stop it.

3243
03:42:26,080 --> 03:42:26,340
Stop.

3244
03:42:29,300 --> 03:42:34,300
Yeah, also homework and tests and...

3245
03:42:35,180 --> 03:42:39,820
In continuation of from last semester, I'm to be class president once again.

3246
03:42:40,100 --> 03:42:41,820
I hope we can make this another wonderful semester.

3247
03:42:41,820 --> 03:42:46,920
The role of class president holds a lot of responsibilities, but I think I'm up to the task.

3248
03:42:54,310 --> 03:42:54,310
Prom?

3249
03:42:54,570 --> 03:42:55,490
I didn't go to prom.

3250
03:42:56,870 --> 03:43:01,210
Even when I was young, I always wanted to be the mom or big sister whenever I played house.

3251
03:43:01,510 --> 03:43:04,110
I think it's because I really enjoyed looking after others.

3252
03:43:05,110 --> 03:43:08,350
I was just two seconds away from saying, is this Renko?

3253
03:43:08,850 --> 03:43:14,870
Because it's always the mean girls being hypocritical.

3254
03:43:17,970 --> 03:43:24,970
I believe that every single student in our class has things they excel in, as well as things they could stand to work on.

3255
03:43:26,470 --> 03:43:30,290
In my view, the purpose of a class president is to help others with their shortcomings.

3256
03:43:30,690 --> 03:43:34,430
So we can make school an enjoyable place for everyone.

3257
03:43:39,150 --> 03:43:41,730
You at the prom with five guys?

3258
03:43:42,650 --> 03:43:44,230
They let you bring in burgers?

3259
03:43:45,970 --> 03:43:46,850
What's a goal?

3260
03:43:49,650 --> 03:43:51,810
Wait, did I check back here?

3261
03:43:52,930 --> 03:43:55,170
I kind of want a burger now.

3262
03:44:03,220 --> 03:44:04,520
Stole the joke from me?

3263
03:44:09,750 --> 03:44:10,870
Five guys.

3264
03:44:11,390 --> 03:44:12,310
And fries.

3265
03:44:13,430 --> 03:44:14,750
Why is it called Five Guys?

3266
03:44:15,330 --> 03:44:16,590
Was a single...

3267
03:44:20,190 --> 03:44:21,330
You heard that, right?

3268
03:44:21,850 --> 03:44:24,150
Was a single burger invented by Five Guys?

3269
03:44:26,610 --> 03:44:28,690
Alright, what do we do here?

3270
03:44:32,720 --> 03:44:33,180
Oh.

3271
03:44:34,920 --> 03:44:36,360
One dad, four sons.

3272
03:44:38,120 --> 03:44:40,740
Surprise, this doesn't have anything written on it, you know.

3273
03:44:44,200 --> 03:44:45,680
I'm looking around, sorry.

3274
03:44:50,930 --> 03:44:54,010
In continuation from last semester, I'm to be class president once again.

3275
03:44:54,130 --> 03:44:55,670
I hope we can make this another wonderful semester.

3276
03:44:55,830 --> 03:44:57,270
The handwriting turns wild and erratic.

3277
03:44:58,050 --> 03:45:01,430
I love being class president because I get to look over all these lost causes.

3278
03:45:02,210 --> 03:45:31,910
Even when I was young, I always enjoyed comparing myself to others and fear your kids and basking in my own superiority when i pretend to care about others i can please a lot of people the losers i help the people around me and even my parents and frankly that makes me happy as well right now i'm in charge of two girls who are the definition of morons they're both so carefree and empty-headed neither of them knows the first thing about fitting in the only reason sakuko she's talking about me and sakuko

3279
03:45:35,030 --> 03:45:39,290
The only reason they have any friends in that class is because I'm taking care of them.

3280
03:45:39,530 --> 03:45:42,390
They fawn over me and tell me all the time how grateful they are.

3281
03:45:42,550 --> 03:45:43,410
It feels amazing.

3282
03:45:43,970 --> 03:45:46,590
I really truly think I was born to be class president.

3283
03:45:47,030 --> 03:45:48,270
Nishida Rinko.

3284
03:45:51,930 --> 03:45:53,610
This nasty girl.

3285
03:45:59,980 --> 03:46:01,280
Their true colors.

3286
03:46:01,580 --> 03:46:03,760
Silent Hiller is making her true colors show.

3287
03:46:04,720 --> 03:46:05,080
Oh.

3288
03:46:08,020 --> 03:46:09,480
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

3289
03:46:09,680 --> 03:46:10,220
This is before.

3290
03:46:11,100 --> 03:46:11,820
What is this, though?

3291
03:46:16,460 --> 03:46:17,180
Uh-oh.

3292
03:46:21,360 --> 03:46:22,260
Ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow.

3293
03:46:22,940 --> 03:46:23,740
Wait, is there more than one?

3294
03:46:23,900 --> 03:46:24,720
Oh my gosh, there's two.

3295
03:46:26,120 --> 03:46:26,380
Okay.

3296
03:46:27,060 --> 03:46:29,140
An emblem found in strange room.

3297
03:46:31,840 --> 03:46:32,640
Oh my gosh, stop.

3298
03:46:32,720 --> 03:46:33,100
Stop, stop!

3299
03:46:33,740 --> 03:46:34,020
Stop!

3300
03:46:34,200 --> 03:46:34,940
Don't, don't, no, no!

3301
03:46:35,620 --> 03:46:36,220
Wait, I'm trapped.

3302
03:46:36,520 --> 03:46:37,920
I'm trying not to...

3303
03:46:39,400 --> 03:46:40,020
There we go.

3304
03:46:41,580 --> 03:46:43,000
I was trying not to be...

3305
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:44,400
What's it called on her anymore?

3306
03:46:47,280 --> 03:46:48,440
Locked on her anymore.

3307
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:50,500
Okay.

3308
03:46:51,780 --> 03:46:51,860
Okay.

3309
03:46:52,140 --> 03:46:52,540
That was good.

3310
03:46:53,600 --> 03:46:53,860
Yeah, yeah.

3311
03:46:54,260 --> 03:46:54,520
Sorry.

3312
03:46:54,840 --> 03:46:57,080
I got so...

3313
03:46:57,080 --> 03:47:02,940
Okay, we're not going to get ambushed this time, please.

3314
03:47:03,760 --> 03:47:04,420
Thank you.

3315
03:47:05,960 --> 03:47:06,220
Okay.

3316
03:47:10,040 --> 03:47:10,620
Dinko.

3317
03:47:12,080 --> 03:47:12,660
Dinko.

3318
03:47:14,240 --> 03:47:15,520
Did it save?

3319
03:47:15,760 --> 03:47:18,000
I actually couldn't tell, but that's okay.

3320
03:47:29,740 --> 03:47:32,900
I love Watch Five Guy One Borgher.

3321
03:47:44,060 --> 03:47:48,010
What is she looking at?

3322
03:47:48,990 --> 03:47:50,030
It's stressing me out.

3323
03:47:51,690 --> 03:47:52,130
Okay.

3324
03:47:54,710 --> 03:47:56,790
Bombastic side eye.

3325
03:47:59,150 --> 03:47:59,950
Um...

3326
03:48:02,350 --> 03:48:03,210
We'll do that.

3327
03:48:07,010 --> 03:48:08,170
Alright, let's see.

3328
03:48:08,950 --> 03:48:12,250
Now, we got to get to the board.

3329
03:48:17,850 --> 03:48:19,750
So I open up a green.

3330
03:48:25,610 --> 03:48:26,370
Let's double check.

3331
03:48:27,030 --> 03:48:27,910
If it's closed.

3332
03:48:32,630 --> 03:48:34,190
You could leave at any time, girl!

3333
03:48:35,730 --> 03:48:37,090
Okay, so we open up green.

3334
03:48:38,890 --> 03:48:39,410
Oh, wait.

3335
03:48:39,590 --> 03:48:41,550
Oh, I do have to go back into that room, though.

3336
03:48:42,350 --> 03:48:42,790
No!

3337
03:48:43,070 --> 03:48:43,390
Wait.

3338
03:48:43,670 --> 03:48:44,710
Oh, this sucks.

3339
03:48:44,790 --> 03:48:45,790
I should have done the bird.

3340
03:48:46,450 --> 03:48:48,510
Wait, I should have done the bird first.

3341
03:48:49,490 --> 03:48:50,190
Oh, freaky.

3342
03:48:51,390 --> 03:48:52,270
Dang it.

3343
03:48:53,710 --> 03:48:55,270
Right now she can't.

3344
03:49:02,500 --> 03:49:04,160
Just do bunny and blue?

3345
03:49:07,060 --> 03:49:10,000
No, I can't, because then these doors will shut.

3346
03:49:10,700 --> 03:49:12,760
This one's right here, in the middle.

3347
03:49:21,580 --> 03:49:23,260
Oh, if I enter through the top.

3348
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:25,020
Oh, I see, I see.

3349
03:49:26,420 --> 03:49:32,460
It will unleash two of those screaming baby monsters on me, but I can just run past them.

3350
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:34,900
Okay.

3351
03:49:35,920 --> 03:49:36,940
Yeah, you're right.

3352
03:49:40,220 --> 03:49:41,080
Okay, you're right.

3353
03:49:44,260 --> 03:49:46,080
So bunny and blue.

3354
03:49:53,770 --> 03:49:55,510
Yeah, we just book it to the room, exactly.

3355
03:49:57,110 --> 03:49:58,690
My health is...

3356
03:50:00,230 --> 03:50:00,710
Satisfactory.

3357
03:50:10,280 --> 03:50:11,620
It's really this part.

3358
03:50:27,920 --> 03:50:28,680
Oh, shoot.

3359
03:50:28,920 --> 03:50:29,360
Oh, shoot.

3360
03:50:29,440 --> 03:50:30,220
Oh, shoot!

3361
03:50:30,420 --> 03:50:31,020
Let me out, please!

3362
03:50:34,400 --> 03:50:36,640
And you're also screaming, baby.

3363
03:50:37,740 --> 03:50:40,020
Okay, we got all these screaming babies going on.

3364
03:50:40,300 --> 03:50:41,160
Just dodge past.

3365
03:50:41,640 --> 03:50:43,300
And keep on, keep it on.

3366
03:50:44,180 --> 03:50:45,380
And open the door.

3367
03:50:45,620 --> 03:50:46,020
Open the door.

3368
03:50:49,160 --> 03:50:50,440
Oh, go in.

3369
03:50:51,280 --> 03:50:51,600
Oh, my gosh.

3370
03:50:52,060 --> 03:50:52,140
Okay.

3371
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:53,440
Alright.

3372
03:50:53,760 --> 03:50:55,580
Oh, this is the candy store.

3373
03:50:58,250 --> 03:50:59,850
Letter from Rinko to Hinako.

3374
03:51:00,230 --> 03:51:00,790
Hinako...

3375
03:51:00,810 --> 03:51:02,490
Here, you'll feel better after eating this.

3376
03:51:02,630 --> 03:51:04,370
Forgive what those jerks said today, and don't worry.

3377
03:51:04,770 --> 03:51:06,170
They'll be getting an earful from me.

3378
03:51:06,870 --> 03:51:08,150
You just have to be yourself, Hinako.

3379
03:51:08,350 --> 03:51:10,570
You can't worry about what other people say is normal.

3380
03:51:10,750 --> 03:51:12,110
That's their normal, not yours.

3381
03:51:12,450 --> 03:51:15,390
I'll always be looking out for you from your best friend, Riko.

3382
03:51:16,230 --> 03:51:18,850
Why did it have to turn out like this?

3383
03:51:20,410 --> 03:51:20,850
Why?

3384
03:51:21,170 --> 03:51:21,470
No!

3385
03:51:22,330 --> 03:51:22,690
No.

3386
03:51:22,690 --> 03:51:26,230
I'm going to go to Jisiru Yau.

3387
03:51:28,370 --> 03:51:29,430
I'm going to go to go to the world.

3388
03:51:31,190 --> 03:51:32,070
Aso-san!

3389
03:51:32,390 --> 03:51:34,250
It could have been besties!

3390
03:51:40,680 --> 03:51:41,560
Kutsu tea.

3391
03:51:42,700 --> 03:51:44,360
Oh shoot.

3392
03:51:47,500 --> 03:51:48,020
Maybe it's fine.

3393
03:51:48,100 --> 03:51:48,260
Wait.

3394
03:51:49,000 --> 03:51:50,600
It can also be used as an offering.

3395
03:52:02,350 --> 03:52:05,930
I do have two first full- two first aid kits but...

3396
03:52:09,270 --> 03:52:09,710
Hmm.

3397
03:52:10,310 --> 03:52:11,430
Could replace the chocolate.

3398
03:52:11,530 --> 03:52:12,070
It sells for more.

3399
03:52:12,090 --> 03:52:14,550
Oh, that's what I was actually going to ask.

3400
03:52:14,650 --> 03:52:17,830
I was going to say, does the Kudzu tea, like, well.

3401
03:52:20,230 --> 03:52:21,850
Let's see what else is in here, too.

3402
03:52:24,610 --> 03:52:26,170
Because if we get another chocolate bar.

3403
03:52:28,110 --> 03:52:29,190
Rinko's Secret Journal.

3404
03:52:29,410 --> 03:52:31,230
Why do I have to live here of all places?

3405
03:52:31,650 --> 03:52:33,450
Shu lives all the way on the other side of town.

3406
03:52:33,610 --> 03:52:37,370
This girl is, she has one train of thought, and it's Shu.

3407
03:52:37,970 --> 03:52:40,410
She can't think of literally anything else.

3408
03:52:42,690 --> 03:52:43,890
Katsu is 100?

3409
03:52:44,370 --> 03:52:46,450
Oh, over the chocolate, I think, was 80, right?

3410
03:52:46,970 --> 03:52:49,790
Meaning my dream of us walking home together will never come true.

3411
03:52:50,470 --> 03:52:54,410
I remember how I organized everyone from class to go to Chizuruya together after school.

3412
03:52:54,750 --> 03:52:57,210
We chatted as we walked, then went our separate ways home.

3413
03:52:57,650 --> 03:53:00,630
The walk to the store just pain was painfully short.

3414
03:53:00,990 --> 03:53:05,970
Still having just a few extra minutes that I could spend with Shu outside of school was all that I could have asked for.

3415
03:53:10,980 --> 03:53:14,700
If only a Shu wasn't such an amazing, irresistible hottie.

3416
03:53:15,380 --> 03:53:22,660
they could have been different i know he's just so dreamy shoo

3417
03:53:28,400 --> 03:53:44,680
like i get having a crush i'm not gonna fault her for you know these candies bring back memories i'm not gonna fault her for liking the guy but dang she's so obsessive with him

3418
03:53:47,970 --> 03:53:53,990
okay Is there anything else that I could switch out, though?

3419
03:53:54,950 --> 03:53:56,350
I guess everything else is kind of like...

3420
03:53:56,350 --> 03:53:58,710
I use, like, health items, you know?

3421
03:54:03,980 --> 03:54:06,820
So I guess the chocolate will replace.

3422
03:54:08,120 --> 03:54:10,300
Wait, how much does the divine water sell for?

3423
03:54:18,170 --> 03:54:19,890
How much health sanity do I have?

3424
03:54:20,330 --> 03:54:21,170
Oh, it's only 50?

3425
03:54:21,230 --> 03:54:22,070
Then we'll switch out that.

3426
03:54:22,130 --> 03:54:23,610
My sanity is, like, max.

3427
03:54:26,370 --> 03:54:26,810
So...

3428
03:54:28,090 --> 03:54:30,030
We'll switch out with the divine water.

3429
03:54:32,610 --> 03:54:33,090
Okay.

3430
03:54:36,030 --> 03:54:39,030
Yeah, pills don't sell for anything, but I can use them for my health.

3431
03:54:39,790 --> 03:54:40,790
I have been using them.

3432
03:54:41,090 --> 03:54:42,330
In fact, I'll take one right now.

3433
03:54:44,710 --> 03:54:46,710
I like reading what the...

3434
03:54:46,710 --> 03:54:47,410
What's it called?

3435
03:54:47,630 --> 03:54:50,270
The notes change to after...

3436
03:54:50,270 --> 03:54:53,650
I hope nothing attacks me, though, so I can actually read them, please.

3437
03:54:58,450 --> 03:54:58,930
Oh!

3438
03:54:59,750 --> 03:55:00,230
Quick!

3439
03:55:00,930 --> 03:55:01,310
Break!

3440
03:55:01,830 --> 03:55:01,830
Ow!

3441
03:55:02,270 --> 03:55:02,650
Ow!

3442
03:55:02,850 --> 03:55:03,170
Jeez!

3443
03:55:08,310 --> 03:55:08,670
Ah!

3444
03:55:09,170 --> 03:55:09,670
Nice.

3445
03:55:10,010 --> 03:55:10,570
Oh my god.

3446
03:55:10,890 --> 03:55:11,030
Ow!

3447
03:55:11,190 --> 03:55:11,670
Oh my god.

3448
03:55:11,790 --> 03:55:13,810
I'm getting combo, wombo, comboed right now.

3449
03:55:16,050 --> 03:55:17,130
Oh, it's this guy.

3450
03:55:23,480 --> 03:55:25,120
Oh, so I do need...

3451
03:55:25,120 --> 03:55:27,220
There's like some sort of something going on in here.

3452
03:55:27,740 --> 03:55:28,700
Oh my gosh.

3453
03:55:28,940 --> 03:55:29,220
Please.

3454
03:55:31,840 --> 03:55:32,760
Oh my god.

3455
03:55:33,060 --> 03:55:33,560
Oh my god.

3456
03:55:34,120 --> 03:55:35,260
Oh, my sanity.

3457
03:55:35,640 --> 03:55:37,060
I mean, my stamina.

3458
03:55:45,220 --> 03:55:47,300
The game does not pause during cutscenes.

3459
03:55:47,880 --> 03:55:47,880
Yeah.

3460
03:56:02,770 --> 03:56:04,430
Okay, wait, did I lose him?

3461
03:56:05,290 --> 03:56:05,850
Or...

3462
03:56:05,850 --> 03:56:08,050
Oh, he's doing his echo location on me?

3463
03:56:13,650 --> 03:56:14,530
Holy cow.

3464
03:56:21,720 --> 03:56:24,460
Alright, let's do... Let's do this fast.

3465
03:56:25,480 --> 03:56:26,040
Bandage?

3466
03:56:26,220 --> 03:56:26,840
Pick that up.

3467
03:56:33,580 --> 03:56:38,200
As we got closer to the store, our classmates would peel off one by one as they turned to go home.

3468
03:56:38,540 --> 03:56:40,920
It was never just me and Shu on our own, but I didn't care.

3469
03:56:41,160 --> 03:56:43,020
The handwriting grows more erratic and emotional.

3470
03:56:43,260 --> 03:56:46,480
But of course, there was always a dirty little cockroach crawling all over Shu.

3471
03:56:46,940 --> 03:56:47,700
I mean, come on.

3472
03:56:47,960 --> 03:56:49,520
We're all walking home together.

3473
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:52,580
How about having a conversation that everyone else can join in on?

3474
03:56:52,900 --> 03:56:57,700
Don't just go running off on your own little weird space wars world together.

3475
03:57:01,340 --> 03:57:03,420
I opened something and I...

3476
03:57:03,420 --> 03:57:06,680
Okay, I'm looking for the candy that...

3477
03:57:06,680 --> 03:57:07,200
Ta-da!

3478
03:57:08,980 --> 03:57:13,300
I feel like these are supposed to be shocking, but they end up being kind of goofy, silly.

3479
03:57:13,620 --> 03:57:13,720
Ah!

3480
03:57:13,960 --> 03:57:15,080
We found it!

3481
03:57:16,840 --> 03:57:17,760
Pick up, pick up!

3482
03:57:25,870 --> 03:57:26,970
It's kind of sad.

3483
03:57:27,630 --> 03:57:29,610
Alright, let's go read the last note.

3484
03:57:30,710 --> 03:57:31,230
Right here.

3485
03:57:34,670 --> 03:57:36,590
Shinako, here you'll feel better after eating this.

3486
03:57:36,650 --> 03:57:38,750
The handwriting becomes more erratic and emotional.

3487
03:57:39,050 --> 03:57:40,370
I'm such a kind person, you know.

3488
03:57:40,990 --> 03:57:44,690
Would someone who isn't kind give little treats with a wonderful message to their sad friend?

3489
03:57:44,850 --> 03:57:45,910
I am so kind.

3490
03:57:47,270 --> 03:57:52,310
You just have to be yourself, Shinako, because whenever I'm by your side, I realize what an amazing person I am.

3491
03:57:52,610 --> 03:57:55,210
Whenever I help you out, it makes me realize how kind I am.

3492
03:57:55,550 --> 03:58:02,010
I'll always be looking out for both you and Sakuko, because when I look after you two pitiful creatures, it makes me feel so superior.

3493
03:58:03,230 --> 03:58:08,270
or even pet odor from your best friend, Binkle.

3494
03:58:15,340 --> 03:58:16,660
She's, like, so nice.

3495
03:58:16,860 --> 03:58:17,200
Oh, gosh.

3496
03:58:17,420 --> 03:58:17,420
Wait.

3497
03:58:17,560 --> 03:58:18,400
There's that thing up there.

3498
03:58:18,520 --> 03:58:19,120
We have to be careful.

3499
03:58:30,640 --> 03:58:31,040
Wow.

3500
03:58:40,880 --> 03:58:42,700
Yeah, she's, like, such a good person.

3501
03:58:46,220 --> 03:58:46,700
Binko.

3502
03:58:48,380 --> 03:58:50,000
Wait, where do I go after this?

3503
03:58:52,000 --> 03:58:54,100
Maybe to that one door I couldn't go to before?

3504
03:58:55,900 --> 03:58:56,380
Sayonara!

3505
03:59:02,320 --> 03:59:05,180
Oh my gosh, us just staring at her.

3506
03:59:18,940 --> 03:59:21,020
Tell me the doggies are.

3507
03:59:30,150 --> 03:59:30,870
Oh

3508
03:59:38,190 --> 03:59:39,370
my god!

3509
03:59:43,360 --> 03:59:44,640
I'll be back.

3510
03:59:45,120 --> 03:59:46,380
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

3511
03:59:46,940 --> 03:59:48,320
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

3512
03:59:49,640 --> 03:59:51,040
Oh my god!

3513
03:59:52,780 --> 03:59:53,720
She's not cool!

3514
03:59:54,600 --> 03:59:57,280
She's kind of...

3515
03:59:57,860 --> 03:59:58,420
Dang!

3516
03:59:59,880 --> 04:00:04,600
The Tri-Scale Emblem Key obtained after bidding Bidding Farewell

3517
04:00:07,940 --> 04:00:09,720
Bidding Farewell Turinco.

3518
04:00:10,100 --> 04:00:16,240
This seems to be able to open a door somewhere and it's much bigger than the normal key as if it was made for some huge creature to use.

3519
04:00:23,030 --> 04:00:24,050
What was that?

3520
04:00:24,230 --> 04:00:25,850
Oh, I think all the things opened up.

3521
04:00:26,110 --> 04:00:28,510
Oh, what about...

3522
04:00:28,510 --> 04:00:30,590
Oh, I guess we can't go in ever.

3523
04:00:33,290 --> 04:00:34,330
I suppose.

3524
04:00:39,550 --> 04:00:40,750
Doesn't look back.

3525
04:00:41,570 --> 04:00:42,770
She just...

3526
04:00:42,770 --> 04:00:44,150
She just turned around and...

3527
04:00:44,150 --> 04:00:44,310
Wait.

3528
04:00:47,350 --> 04:00:48,470
Farewell, Rinko.

3529
04:00:48,790 --> 04:00:49,350
Farewell.

3530
04:00:49,950 --> 04:00:51,850
And safe travels to you.

3531
04:00:53,430 --> 04:00:54,550
Like, damn.

3532
04:00:57,110 --> 04:00:59,030
Oh, okay, so there's still monsters.

3533
04:01:06,420 --> 04:01:06,500
Okay.

3534
04:01:08,660 --> 04:01:10,740
I'll find a way to open the sacred door.

3535
04:01:11,180 --> 04:01:11,880
Is it not this?

3536
04:01:20,070 --> 04:01:21,110
We made it!

3537
04:01:21,310 --> 04:01:22,750
Hinako literally said, go to hell.

3538
04:01:30,330 --> 04:01:30,850
Oh.

3539
04:01:31,230 --> 04:01:32,250
No way.

3540
04:01:32,490 --> 04:01:33,690
Wait, there's a second door.

3541
04:01:35,830 --> 04:01:39,750
I was two seconds away from being like, well, that section wasn't so bad.

3542
04:01:42,510 --> 04:01:44,110
we have to do it twice

3543
04:01:47,410 --> 04:01:53,590
is there a journal update for dico let's see oh my bad there we go

3544
04:02:01,570 --> 04:02:09,550
oh my god wait what about sakuko what does she look like no she's still fine god her art is so cute

3545
04:02:14,180 --> 04:02:26,840
dico is always asking whether she and i are an item i tell her every time that that we're not but she never seems to buy it i heard a rumor that ninko was gossiping about me behind my back i suppose love can tear apart even the closest of friends i don't know what to do

3546
04:02:30,610 --> 04:03:16,790
there are times when those kind eyes that watch me through the slits of the fox mask turn frighteningly sharp frightening frighteningly sharp it's as if he is looking right through me piercing the very depths of my soul when we walk hand in hand he always stays one step ahead as if guiding me somewhere with my hand in his wait walking when are we hand holding what when did this happen i can keep my eyes cast down towards my feet when i walk when he tugs gently on my hand i know what true happiness is i don't i don't have to think about anything anymore as long as i do what he tells me i know we will be happy Hello?

3547
04:03:18,250 --> 04:03:18,930
Wait, who?

3548
04:03:19,770 --> 04:03:23,350
Not a regular YouTube viewer here saw your performance at Club Iron Mouse and loved it!

3549
04:03:23,870 --> 04:03:24,150
Whoa!

3550
04:03:24,410 --> 04:03:25,870
Thank you so much for the super chat!

3551
04:03:26,310 --> 04:03:26,910
Thank you!

3552
04:03:28,710 --> 04:03:31,110
I really appreciate you dropping by!

3553
04:03:31,410 --> 04:03:32,290
Thank you so much!

3554
04:03:32,390 --> 04:03:33,410
I really appreciate it.

3555
04:03:37,390 --> 04:03:37,910
Uh.

3556
04:03:39,110 --> 04:03:40,690
There was a dark shrine.

3557
04:03:40,870 --> 04:03:41,810
I think something updated.

3558
04:03:44,570 --> 04:03:45,090
Bizarre.

3559
04:03:45,170 --> 04:03:47,490
monster that looks like a bunch of celluloid dolls.

3560
04:03:47,770 --> 04:03:48,710
Maybe we did see this one.

3561
04:03:51,150 --> 04:03:52,270
Go through the door.

3562
04:03:52,390 --> 04:03:53,810
I don't want to do this again.

3563
04:03:54,510 --> 04:03:54,910
Please.

3564
04:04:07,680 --> 04:04:09,340
Oh, it's dark, though.

3565
04:04:10,400 --> 04:04:12,040
Wait, I don't like this one even more.

3566
04:04:14,160 --> 04:04:15,500
Who are we punishing now?

3567
04:04:15,600 --> 04:04:16,360
Shul, you think?

3568
04:04:22,090 --> 04:04:22,490
Right.

3569
04:04:23,470 --> 04:04:25,010
Whose room is this?

3570
04:04:28,490 --> 04:04:29,250
Saku-ko, okay.

3571
04:04:31,930 --> 04:04:35,470
I already hear somebody wandering around out there.

3572
04:04:39,730 --> 04:04:40,870
She loves bunnies.

3573
04:04:42,210 --> 04:04:43,410
She's so cute.

3574
04:04:47,510 --> 04:04:49,330
Saku-ko, I love you.

3575
04:04:52,410 --> 04:04:52,610
Where?

3576
04:04:53,110 --> 04:04:55,010
Oh, they're right literally as...

3577
04:04:55,030 --> 04:04:56,150
when you open the door.

3578
04:04:57,550 --> 04:04:57,810
I think?

3579
04:05:01,390 --> 04:05:01,790
Maybe?

3580
04:05:02,770 --> 04:05:03,590
That sounds like it.

3581
04:05:06,790 --> 04:05:08,050
I can't see from here.

3582
04:05:09,390 --> 04:05:11,210
We can go white bunny first, though.

3583
04:05:13,350 --> 04:05:14,230
Was there anything over here?

3584
04:05:14,370 --> 04:05:14,690
Oh, yes.

3585
04:05:15,750 --> 04:05:17,290
Sakuko parent teacher journal.

3586
04:05:17,530 --> 04:05:17,910
Just a no.

3587
04:05:18,090 --> 04:05:20,990
As Sakuko's mother, I want to thank you for teaching my daughter.

3588
04:05:21,390 --> 04:05:23,570
I wanted to apologize for what happened the other day on the field trip.

3589
04:05:23,770 --> 04:05:25,910
It seemed Sakuko caused a lot of trouble.

3590
04:05:27,990 --> 04:05:58,450
my daughter has always been that way ever since she was young as a child she always hated when the when we turned off the lights to go to bed and she avoided dark movie theaters and tunnels like the plague i mistakenly thought she had overcome her fear of the dark now that she has grown up i believe the reason her fear came back during the field trip is because she is unaccustomed to sleeping in a different environment i gave her a stern talking to for behaving so shamelessly shame shamefully at her age she has since reflected on her behavior and is sorry for how she except both her and my apologies.

3591
04:05:59,770 --> 04:06:01,330
That's so sad.

3592
04:06:05,800 --> 04:06:07,300
Wait, that's so sad.

3593
04:06:20,370 --> 04:06:20,850
Green.

3594
04:06:21,550 --> 04:06:22,310
It must be open.

3595
04:06:23,010 --> 04:06:23,050
Oh.

3596
04:06:23,990 --> 04:06:24,710
Or not.

3597
04:06:29,370 --> 04:06:31,150
Stop making noise in there.

3598
04:06:31,250 --> 04:06:32,390
You're freaking me out.

3599
04:06:33,730 --> 04:06:36,090
Yeah, let a girl be afraid of the dark in peace.

3600
04:06:36,210 --> 04:06:37,450
I'm afraid of the dark.

3601
04:06:38,450 --> 04:06:40,150
Sakuko, I get you.

3602
04:06:40,230 --> 04:06:41,150
I understand you.

3603
04:06:41,270 --> 04:06:42,170
No one else will.

3604
04:06:53,200 --> 04:06:57,240
what the oh why did i switch to that how did i do that actually

3605
04:07:02,680 --> 04:07:05,640
we'll be unable to reanimate oh interesting

3606
04:07:13,980 --> 04:07:24,300
ow wait so oh why cycle oh you're right i didn't even notice that oh it can't reanimate Oh my gosh.

3607
04:07:26,360 --> 04:07:27,580
Sakako is the best.

3608
04:07:28,120 --> 04:07:28,860
The blue flames.

3609
04:07:42,460 --> 04:07:43,020
Oh, yeah.

3610
04:07:43,180 --> 04:07:44,200
The oboe and lantern.

3611
04:07:50,880 --> 04:07:52,720
Is she in that box?

3612
04:07:53,600 --> 04:07:54,040
No.

3613
04:07:54,500 --> 04:07:55,100
No, no, no.

3614
04:07:55,300 --> 04:07:56,800
We gotta get her out of there.

3615
04:07:58,840 --> 04:08:00,160
It's so sad.

3616
04:08:05,470 --> 04:08:05,690
Ah.

3617
04:08:05,910 --> 04:08:07,090
Let me go sell some of these.

3618
04:08:14,740 --> 04:08:15,380
Yeah.

3619
04:08:19,230 --> 04:08:20,950
Um, Kudzu, chocolate.

3620
04:08:23,570 --> 04:08:24,210
180.

3621
04:08:28,490 --> 04:08:30,110
What's my health looking like?

3622
04:08:33,730 --> 04:08:35,930
Oh yeah, how much does the Enadi go for?

3623
04:08:36,270 --> 04:08:36,750
150.

3624
04:08:40,130 --> 04:08:41,550
I want to eat it though.

3625
04:08:41,930 --> 04:08:43,750
I want to eat it.

3626
04:08:47,390 --> 04:08:50,390
I still could like draw a random Omamori.

3627
04:08:55,270 --> 04:08:57,150
I'm trying to decide what I want to do.

3628
04:08:57,310 --> 04:09:00,170
If I want to increase my abilities or get a new Omamori.

3629
04:09:00,270 --> 04:09:03,170
Try for something else or...

3630
04:09:03,970 --> 04:09:05,350
Hawk is still the best.

3631
04:09:06,930 --> 04:09:09,710
Why does it feel so much slower than before?

3632
04:09:09,950 --> 04:09:10,510
Am I crazy?

3633
04:09:10,610 --> 04:09:13,110
Did I gaslight myself into thinking it's slower?

3634
04:09:16,590 --> 04:09:17,870
And then stamina.

3635
04:09:24,920 --> 04:09:26,200
Wait till more stamina?

3636
04:09:26,520 --> 04:09:27,180
You think so?

3637
04:09:27,740 --> 04:09:29,860
Like, keep saving up for it?

3638
04:09:30,420 --> 04:09:31,500
Maybe, yeah.

3639
04:09:32,580 --> 04:09:34,100
Okay, so this switches to rabbit.

3640
04:09:35,200 --> 04:09:36,260
Which opens up this.

3641
04:09:37,920 --> 04:09:40,540
Which I don't see anybody in there, but you never know.

3642
04:09:41,660 --> 04:09:42,720
Opens up that.

3643
04:09:43,020 --> 04:09:44,220
And the other way.

3644
04:09:47,900 --> 04:09:49,580
But if this is still...

3645
04:09:51,620 --> 04:10:00,000
if I don't know I was going to say does it switch both of them am I going to be locked in here

3646
04:10:03,060 --> 04:10:04,180
yeah okay

3647
04:10:15,280 --> 04:10:23,080
I'm just looking around okay green okay

3648
04:10:28,630 --> 04:10:32,650
we got a killer in here okay Whatever.

3649
04:10:33,010 --> 04:10:33,010
Oh.

3650
04:10:33,690 --> 04:10:34,250
Okay.

3651
04:10:39,860 --> 04:10:40,780
Oh, whoops.

3652
04:10:40,900 --> 04:10:41,460
Why did I do that?

3653
04:10:43,300 --> 04:10:44,000
Come

3654
04:10:53,820 --> 04:10:53,960
on!

3655
04:10:54,160 --> 04:10:55,120
Keep stabbing!

3656
04:10:55,540 --> 04:10:56,420
Keep stabbing!

3657
04:10:57,020 --> 04:10:59,120
Try to get back.

3658
04:10:59,720 --> 04:11:00,220
Or not.

3659
04:11:01,040 --> 04:11:01,660
Keep stabbing.

3660
04:11:02,440 --> 04:11:03,460
Oh, nice.

3661
04:11:06,760 --> 04:11:07,160
Yeah!

3662
04:11:07,740 --> 04:11:08,060
Yeah!

3663
04:11:11,140 --> 04:11:12,520
Keep stabbing.

3664
04:11:12,660 --> 04:11:13,400
Keep stabbing.

3665
04:11:15,240 --> 04:11:15,580
What's happening?

3666
04:11:16,520 --> 04:11:17,500
Is this my locker?

3667
04:11:21,500 --> 04:11:22,640
Something's behind there.

3668
04:11:22,840 --> 04:11:23,480
I don't like it.

3669
04:11:23,580 --> 04:11:24,900
I think it's another...

3670
04:11:25,480 --> 04:11:26,900
I think it's another baby.

3671
04:11:27,300 --> 04:11:27,940
Baby head.

3672
04:11:29,680 --> 04:11:31,700
This changes red.

3673
04:11:32,640 --> 04:11:33,360
Tigashi?

3674
04:11:35,860 --> 04:11:37,060
Is this red?

3675
04:11:38,000 --> 04:11:39,200
Which one's red?

3676
04:11:41,000 --> 04:11:41,720
Oh!

3677
04:11:42,660 --> 04:11:43,080
Wait.

3678
04:11:44,260 --> 04:11:45,060
Oh!

3679
04:11:45,700 --> 04:11:46,100
Oh!

3680
04:11:46,480 --> 04:11:46,780
Oh!

3681
04:11:46,800 --> 04:11:48,000
Oh, it was red and now...

3682
04:11:48,000 --> 04:11:48,840
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3683
04:11:49,240 --> 04:11:49,940
I'm like, hello.

3684
04:11:50,840 --> 04:11:51,780
I'm a little lost.

3685
04:11:54,140 --> 04:11:54,940
Stabby, stabby.

3686
04:11:55,740 --> 04:11:56,540
Sakuko's diary.

3687
04:11:56,940 --> 04:11:57,980
I hate gym class.

3688
04:11:58,160 --> 04:11:58,580
Oh, my gosh.

3689
04:11:58,680 --> 04:11:59,800
Wait, there's so many pages.

3690
04:12:00,320 --> 04:12:02,580
And look at how erratic it's all written.

3691
04:12:03,100 --> 04:12:05,060
Just looking at my gym clothes makes me depressed.

3692
04:12:05,440 --> 04:12:07,460
They're holding a long distance race at school soon.

3693
04:12:07,600 --> 04:12:10,740
I know it's just an excuse for them to watch me come and last and laugh at me.

3694
04:12:13,480 --> 04:12:14,080
I'm so...

3695
04:12:14,080 --> 04:12:15,700
I am here to apologize.

3696
04:12:16,800 --> 04:12:26,580
day i asked about your blue archive pulls afterwards i pulled four six stars and 30 pulls in arc knights i'm sorry i

3697
04:12:30,540 --> 04:13:20,660
don't know actually arc knight pulls is that good okay i'm guessing it's good um yeah thanks for stealing my luck shrub that's fine i would i would much rather other uh you guys have my luck than me it's okay don't don't think about it insanely rare oh six is the highest okay got it got it six stars is three stars equivalent okay okay okay um yeah no it's okay i'd rather you uh have all i'd rather you guys have luck than than me it's fine uh i knew how lonely i would feel if everyone just left me in the dust so i asked binko if she would hang back so we could run across the finish line together and you know What?

3698
04:13:20,800 --> 04:13:21,800
She said yes.

3699
04:13:22,660 --> 04:13:23,920
I asked Hinako too.

3700
04:13:24,620 --> 04:13:25,700
But she said no.

3701
04:13:27,960 --> 04:13:32,540
She said it's because she's in a sports club and she'll get yelled at by the teacher if she doesn't try her best.

3702
04:13:33,560 --> 04:13:35,300
Well, I suppose that makes sense if it's true.

3703
04:13:36,200 --> 04:13:37,680
The handwriting suddenly turns erratic.

3704
04:13:38,260 --> 04:13:38,900
But I know the truth.

3705
04:13:39,020 --> 04:13:43,100
I know it's really because you don't want to be held back by a slowpoke like me.

3706
04:13:43,860 --> 04:13:47,900
I hope Hinako trips and falls and breaks all the bones in her body so she can never run again.

3707
04:13:50,480 --> 04:13:51,900
Are we the bad guy?

3708
04:14:07,580 --> 04:14:09,300
Maybe we can lure it in here.

3709
04:14:09,800 --> 04:14:10,460
Wait, hold on.

3710
04:14:10,660 --> 04:14:11,780
I'm just exploring real quick.

3711
04:14:12,820 --> 04:14:14,040
Maybe we can lure... Oh, wait, there.

3712
04:14:14,440 --> 04:14:14,940
Bandage.

3713
04:14:15,080 --> 04:14:15,380
No, it's okay.

3714
04:14:21,250 --> 04:14:22,290
It's complicated.

3715
04:14:23,990 --> 04:14:25,470
Yeah, it is slightly ill.

3716
04:14:26,270 --> 04:14:26,710
Absolutely.

3717
04:14:28,550 --> 04:14:30,150
Why else would we be here?

3718
04:14:38,820 --> 04:14:40,200
Let's try and lure it.

3719
04:14:50,700 --> 04:14:51,180
Oh my god.

3720
04:14:52,560 --> 04:14:53,540
Are you kidding me right now?

3721
04:15:31,410 --> 04:15:32,450
Okay, nice.

3722
04:15:32,950 --> 04:15:35,290
Well, we got one thing, I guess.

3723
04:15:37,970 --> 04:15:38,990
That was crazy!

3724
04:15:39,890 --> 04:15:42,690
Oh, let's see.

3725
04:15:42,770 --> 04:15:42,910
You.

3726
04:15:44,210 --> 04:15:44,470
Nice.

3727
04:15:45,290 --> 04:15:49,830
My sanity, though, is, like, completely gone.

3728
04:15:54,750 --> 04:15:57,470
But that, does that, like, regenerate over time?

3729
04:15:57,710 --> 04:15:58,350
I can't remember.

3730
04:16:04,780 --> 04:16:05,960
Who needs to be sane?

3731
04:16:06,080 --> 04:16:06,580
So true.

3732
04:16:11,170 --> 04:16:13,110
I could go back and save.

3733
04:16:14,270 --> 04:16:15,510
It'd be kind of a walk, though.

3734
04:16:19,640 --> 04:16:20,040
Come, come.

3735
04:16:20,540 --> 04:16:21,220
I hear you.

3736
04:16:21,920 --> 04:16:22,400
Come.

3737
04:16:23,140 --> 04:16:24,400
Oh, you're in there!

3738
04:16:24,880 --> 04:16:25,740
That's why!

3739
04:16:29,380 --> 04:16:30,960
Oh, you're in there!

3740
04:16:32,140 --> 04:16:33,100
All right, hold on.

3741
04:16:33,180 --> 04:16:34,040
Let me see what's going on.

3742
04:16:34,100 --> 04:16:35,820
Let's see the damage.

3743
04:16:37,340 --> 04:16:38,220
Ah, okay.

3744
04:16:38,520 --> 04:16:39,440
So green is open.

3745
04:16:39,520 --> 04:16:41,020
We could go back to the star.

3746
04:16:41,320 --> 04:16:41,480
Wait.

3747
04:16:44,900 --> 04:16:45,780
But rabbit...

3748
04:16:45,780 --> 04:16:47,140
I think we're on rabbit.

3749
04:16:47,240 --> 04:16:48,040
Yeah, we're on rabbit.

3750
04:16:48,380 --> 04:16:49,080
I could go save.

3751
04:17:03,980 --> 04:17:05,200
Yeah, it's this way.

3752
04:17:05,640 --> 04:17:07,280
Wait, this wasn't written here before, right?

3753
04:17:08,160 --> 04:17:09,380
It's the traitor.

3754
04:17:14,520 --> 04:17:16,140
Oh, it's written all over.

3755
04:17:17,400 --> 04:17:20,440
Oh, it's written all over.

3756
04:17:25,940 --> 04:17:26,140
Okay.

3757
04:17:27,540 --> 04:17:28,720
Good, good, good, good.

3758
04:17:29,440 --> 04:17:30,880
And our sanity is restored?

3759
04:17:31,360 --> 04:17:31,700
Yeah!

3760
04:17:32,300 --> 04:17:32,660
Awesome.

3761
04:17:35,240 --> 04:17:37,500
Oh, that's not so good.

3762
04:17:41,940 --> 04:17:50,380

What's over here?

3768
04:18:31,630 --> 04:18:31,690
Ah!

3769
04:18:34,820 --> 04:18:35,200
Dodge!

3770
04:18:41,040 --> 04:18:42,380
Oh, really?

3771
04:18:42,800 --> 04:18:44,080
No way!

3772
04:18:44,280 --> 04:18:45,380
Parried me!

3773
04:18:46,640 --> 04:18:48,320
Oh my gosh.

3774
04:18:50,020 --> 04:18:51,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3775
04:18:52,160 --> 04:18:53,080
Ouch, ouch.

3776
04:18:53,080 --> 04:18:53,280
Ouch.

3777
04:18:53,280 --> 04:18:53,760
Ouch.

3778
04:18:56,260 --> 04:18:57,720
I should have seen that comment.

3779
04:18:58,220 --> 04:18:58,720
Oh my god!

3780
04:18:59,320 --> 04:19:00,960
Oh, I'm so screwed right now.

3781
04:19:03,080 --> 04:19:03,680
Oh, okay.

3782
04:19:04,800 --> 04:19:06,020
Yeah, yeah, we can't die yet.

3783
04:19:06,100 --> 04:19:06,720
We can't die yet.

3784
04:19:07,220 --> 04:19:07,720
Oh my gosh.

3785
04:19:08,220 --> 04:19:09,840
I thought I was gonna die for real, though.

3786
04:19:12,960 --> 04:19:14,820
Wow, I can't believe she parried me.

3787
04:19:16,640 --> 04:19:17,200
What's even...

3788
04:19:17,200 --> 04:19:18,360
There better be something good.

3789
04:19:18,480 --> 04:19:18,640
Okay.

3790
04:19:19,600 --> 04:19:20,860
I forgive you.

3791
04:19:21,740 --> 04:19:22,640
I forgive you.

3792
04:19:23,220 --> 04:19:23,940
Oh, I could have...

3793
04:19:23,940 --> 04:19:24,900
Actually, I should have probably...

3794
04:19:24,920 --> 04:19:56,380
that instead oh well yeah i was very close whoops we're fine maybe let me go restore my sanity once again and then we will uh uh open that door monsters can't pair you just hit the wall is that what happened that's so funny if if that's it That's so silly.

3795
04:19:57,040 --> 04:19:58,100
I can't believe I parried the wall.

3796
04:19:58,580 --> 04:19:59,240
Alright, not parried.

3797
04:19:59,400 --> 04:19:59,940
I hit the wall.

3798
04:20:00,840 --> 04:20:01,200
Really?

3799
04:20:01,820 --> 04:20:03,180
It didn't look like I hit the wall.

3800
04:20:03,600 --> 04:20:04,480
Oh well, whatever.

3801
04:20:07,020 --> 04:20:08,600
This game is really bad for wall bonking.

3802
04:20:08,880 --> 04:20:09,700
Oh, okay, okay.

3803
04:20:11,260 --> 04:20:11,980
I didn't...

3804
04:20:11,980 --> 04:20:12,320
Oops.

3805
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:19,240
I mean, I knew something was going to be behind there, but at the same time, it always gets me.

3806
04:20:20,500 --> 04:20:22,120
And then I'm bad at dealing with it.

3807
04:20:24,260 --> 04:20:24,620
Okay.

3808
04:20:24,920 --> 04:20:26,760
Okay, calm down!

3809
04:20:29,420 --> 04:20:30,940
I'm coming to get you, baby!

3810
04:20:34,180 --> 04:20:35,720
Wait, oh, you're leaving.

3811
04:20:37,580 --> 04:20:37,900
Wait.

3812
04:20:42,200 --> 04:20:42,640
Um...

3813
04:20:42,640 --> 04:20:45,100
Maybe we can lead it to...

3814
04:20:46,140 --> 04:20:48,360
Uh, oh wait, no, there is no room left.

3815
04:20:49,320 --> 04:20:50,600
That has the lantern.

3816
04:20:51,000 --> 04:20:52,120
I can't get in here either.

3817
04:20:53,440 --> 04:20:54,560
Dang, that kind of sucks.

3818
04:20:57,280 --> 04:20:58,980
But I need to get in there.

3819
04:21:01,140 --> 04:21:01,680
Where'd it go?

3820
04:21:05,080 --> 04:21:06,860
Oh, I think she is right behind me.

3821
04:21:07,020 --> 04:21:07,080
Ah!

3822
04:21:20,460 --> 04:21:22,320
Good thing it's a loop.

3823
04:21:30,000 --> 04:21:31,200
What's in here, anyway?

3824
04:21:35,670 --> 04:21:35,810
Oh.

3825
04:21:37,170 --> 04:21:37,590
Wait.

3826
04:21:38,430 --> 04:21:39,210
That's food.

3827
04:21:39,890 --> 04:21:43,090
Wait, what's in here?

3828
04:21:45,090 --> 04:21:45,930
Find Sakuko?

3829
04:21:47,290 --> 04:21:47,650
Huh?

3830
04:21:48,910 --> 04:21:50,030
That's the thing that I needed?

3831
04:21:59,010 --> 04:22:00,250
Maybe I have to kill it.

3832
04:22:00,390 --> 04:22:00,630
Maybe?

3833
04:22:09,840 --> 04:22:14,120
Forgot to mention yesterday, but I have received the invisible girl figure.

3834
04:22:14,440 --> 04:22:14,740
Whoa!

3835
04:22:15,220 --> 04:22:15,860
So fast!

3836
04:22:15,960 --> 04:22:16,760
It looks so, so good.

3837
04:22:16,860 --> 04:22:18,300
Thank you again for showing this figure to us, Minto.

3838
04:22:18,620 --> 04:22:19,100
Of course!

3839
04:22:19,220 --> 04:22:20,580
I'm glad you got it, Jay!

3840
04:22:21,460 --> 04:22:21,880
Nice.

3841
04:22:22,900 --> 04:22:25,040
I need to enter the green door south.

3842
04:22:26,860 --> 04:22:29,520
Ah, I see them, I see them, I see them!

3843
04:22:32,760 --> 04:22:33,480
Oh, okay.

3844
04:22:34,020 --> 04:22:36,380
Right now we're on red, so we need to switch it to green.

3845
04:22:38,880 --> 04:22:40,420
Oh, I see, okay, I forgot.

3846
04:22:44,040 --> 04:22:45,880
Why did I let this thing out then?

3847
04:22:46,140 --> 04:22:47,940
Oh my gosh, it was an absolute trap.

3848
04:22:49,760 --> 04:22:56,320
It wasn't- Maybe I can get it, though, to the room.

3849
04:22:56,940 --> 04:22:58,340
Now and kill it for good.

3850
04:22:58,760 --> 04:23:00,600
Well, I guess there's really no...

3851
04:23:01,120 --> 04:23:01,760
No, no, no.

3852
04:23:01,880 --> 04:23:02,840
Oh my god, such bad timing.

3853
04:23:03,680 --> 04:23:04,120
Rudd?

3854
04:23:04,120 --> 04:23:04,320
Okay.

3855
04:23:08,140 --> 04:23:08,580
Rudd?

3856
04:23:08,900 --> 04:23:10,560
Go silly.

3857
04:23:11,460 --> 04:23:11,900
Alright.

3858
04:23:12,580 --> 04:23:13,760
Let me sell this, though.

3859
04:23:15,280 --> 04:23:16,100
Because I'm a gamer?

3860
04:23:16,580 --> 04:23:16,900
Oh, wait.

3861
04:23:17,260 --> 04:23:17,900
Well, that's fine.

3862
04:23:18,580 --> 04:23:20,920
If this sells for good money, then why not?

3863
04:23:22,360 --> 04:23:22,800
Whoa!

3864
04:23:27,020 --> 04:23:27,460
Offering!

3865
04:23:33,680 --> 04:23:34,320
Yeah.

3866
04:23:38,540 --> 04:23:38,720
Oh.

3867
04:23:42,560 --> 04:23:44,280
I could do more stamina.

3868
04:23:54,940 --> 04:23:56,220
Health or stamina.

3869
04:23:59,440 --> 04:24:02,660
I almost want to do more health because I haven't increased it yet.

3870
04:24:04,940 --> 04:24:08,780
Oh, stam is the way.

3871
04:24:10,200 --> 04:24:10,760
If you have...

3872
04:24:10,780 --> 04:24:15,080
If you have so much stamina, you can just dodge for days, which is pretty nice.

3873
04:24:16,980 --> 04:24:18,360
So, I think, yeah, stamina.

3874
04:24:18,460 --> 04:24:19,000
We'll go stamina.

3875
04:24:21,460 --> 04:24:21,960
Yippee!

3876
04:24:23,680 --> 04:24:28,420
And, honestly, I mean, I could just offer, like, this.

3877
04:24:29,880 --> 04:24:33,440
And then get health, too, if I really wanted it.

3878
04:24:45,320 --> 04:24:46,700
Wait, I have no more emma?

3879
04:24:47,340 --> 04:24:47,860
Okay.

3880
04:24:48,200 --> 04:24:49,760
Oh my gosh, you're right.

3881
04:24:49,880 --> 04:24:50,280
No!

3882
04:24:53,100 --> 04:24:54,120
Oh, no!

3883
04:24:54,300 --> 04:24:55,620
Okay, we'll find another one.

3884
04:24:56,100 --> 04:24:56,580
Someday.

3885
04:25:01,100 --> 04:25:01,640
Whoops, whoops.

3886
04:25:02,180 --> 04:25:02,480
Uh.

3887
04:25:03,380 --> 04:25:04,880
Alright, now we switch this up.

3888
04:25:16,440 --> 04:25:16,920
Okay.

3889
04:25:19,800 --> 04:25:20,280
Okay.

3890
04:25:20,500 --> 04:25:21,100
Oh, oh.

3891
04:25:21,620 --> 04:25:21,800
Oh.

3892
04:25:22,540 --> 04:25:24,140
Do you see that down there?

3893
04:25:24,380 --> 04:25:25,800
Oh my gosh.

3894
04:25:26,560 --> 04:25:27,880
You see that!

3895
04:25:27,960 --> 04:25:29,360
That person down there in the hall!

3896
04:25:30,560 --> 04:25:31,400
That's freaky.

3897
04:25:32,760 --> 04:25:34,280
Wait, okay, hold on.

3898
04:25:40,580 --> 04:25:42,320
Oh, what about the blue...

3899
04:25:42,840 --> 04:25:43,820
Okay, whatever.

3900
04:25:45,040 --> 04:25:46,160
Just a box.

3901
04:25:48,920 --> 04:25:51,020
We'll have to change it back to blue somehow.

3902
04:25:56,670 --> 04:25:58,230
I don't want to go that way.

3903
04:25:59,990 --> 04:26:00,450
Oh.

3904
04:26:01,250 --> 04:26:02,490
Well, it doesn't matter what I want.

3905
04:26:03,850 --> 04:26:04,830
Does not matter what I want.

3906
04:26:04,990 --> 04:26:05,990
Does not matter what I want.

3907
04:26:06,670 --> 04:26:07,350
Come on.

3908
04:26:07,790 --> 04:26:08,130
Oh

3909
04:26:22,270 --> 04:26:24,290
shoot, dang it.

3910
04:26:26,190 --> 04:26:27,670
Ah, I tried to dodge.

3911
04:26:28,850 --> 04:26:30,270
Bad at it.

3912
04:26:30,590 --> 04:26:31,070
Okay, cool.

3913
04:26:33,390 --> 04:26:34,370
Oh my goodness.

3914
04:26:40,060 --> 04:26:40,860
Okay, okay.

3915
04:26:42,200 --> 04:26:44,400
All right, let's, I guess we'll go that way then.

3916
04:26:49,120 --> 04:26:50,540
I hear like chains.

3917
04:26:51,840 --> 04:26:52,340
Jingling.

3918
04:26:52,640 --> 04:26:53,400
Oh, maybe these.

3919
04:27:12,760 --> 04:27:13,760
I know these are...

3920
04:27:13,760 --> 04:27:14,120
I really...

3921
04:27:14,120 --> 04:27:15,620
I know these areas are like...

3922
04:27:16,780 --> 04:27:17,200
Puzzly.

3923
04:27:18,760 --> 04:27:20,520
They're supposed to be like a puzzle, you know.

3924
04:27:22,580 --> 04:27:23,600
But I just don't...

3925
04:27:23,620 --> 04:27:25,100
like them.

3926
04:27:29,370 --> 04:27:31,110
I'm just not a big fan.

3927
04:27:33,990 --> 04:27:35,670
I wish more puzzle-less combat.

3928
04:27:37,690 --> 04:27:38,730
what's in there?

3929
04:27:41,950 --> 04:27:43,170
No one likes this part?

3930
04:27:43,350 --> 04:27:45,050
Okay, I'm glad it's not just me, then.

3931
04:28:00,840 --> 04:28:01,040
Okay.

3932
04:28:05,800 --> 04:28:07,080
You liked this part?

3933
04:28:07,480 --> 04:28:08,420
It's fine if you do.

3934
04:28:09,360 --> 04:28:10,680
It's just, I don't like it.

3935
04:28:10,920 --> 04:28:11,380
Musagi.

3936
04:28:15,620 --> 04:28:16,260
What's wrong?

3937
04:28:25,200 --> 04:28:26,280
What's in there?

3938
04:28:26,700 --> 04:28:29,640
Oh, there's that guy over there.

3939
04:28:30,320 --> 04:28:31,740
That's not what I was hearing though, is it?

3940
04:28:32,980 --> 04:28:33,600
There's no way.

3941
04:28:33,940 --> 04:28:34,560
Is it?

3942
04:28:40,100 --> 04:28:41,060
I don't think so.

3943
04:28:41,500 --> 04:28:45,940
Yeah, the blue lantern definitely helps a lot.

3944
04:28:46,240 --> 04:28:46,440
Yeah.

3945
04:28:47,860 --> 04:28:49,320
I'm scared to go in here.

3946
04:29:03,420 --> 04:29:05,760
Oh, come on.

3947
04:29:05,900 --> 04:29:07,140
Where did you come from?

3948
04:29:08,180 --> 04:29:10,120
I don't even read, I don't even hear what she said.

3949
04:29:12,040 --> 04:29:13,640
Something about a freak liking bunnies?

3950
04:29:14,300 --> 04:29:15,640
What's wrong with liking bunnies?

3951
04:29:18,720 --> 04:29:20,280
Hey, Mr. Raba, guess what?

3952
04:29:21,040 --> 04:29:22,400
I made my first ever friend today.

3953
04:29:22,480 --> 04:29:24,020
Her name is Shimizu Hinako.

3954
04:29:24,720 --> 04:29:28,320
But Mr. Raba, she's my first ever real-life human friend, so I'm a little scared.

3955
04:29:28,620 --> 04:29:30,260
What if she throws me away and forgets me?

3956
04:29:31,800 --> 04:29:32,320
not happening.

3957
04:29:32,840 --> 04:29:37,540
When I told my new bestest friend Hineko this, she said she never ever, ever abandoned me.

3958
04:29:37,780 --> 04:29:38,440
Not ever.

3959
04:29:38,780 --> 04:29:39,640
She promised me.

3960
04:29:39,960 --> 04:29:41,120
But you know what, Mr. Rabbit?

3961
04:29:41,360 --> 04:29:43,260
His handwriting suddenly turns erratic.

3962
04:29:43,560 --> 04:29:43,620
Uh-oh.

3963
04:29:43,900 --> 04:29:45,300
What if Hineko breaks her promise?

3964
04:29:45,420 --> 04:29:46,340
What if she betrays me?

3965
04:29:46,380 --> 04:29:47,400
What if she's lying?

3966
04:29:47,740 --> 04:29:49,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want to think about that.

3967
04:29:50,320 --> 04:29:52,280
Hineko said she wouldn't ever leave me.

3968
04:29:52,560 --> 04:29:53,320
She promised.

3969
04:29:53,380 --> 04:29:55,620
I have to believe her because that's what friends do, right?

3970
04:29:55,920 --> 04:29:56,820
They believe each other.

3971
04:29:57,280 --> 04:29:59,080
Hineko, if you betray me, you'll pay.

3972
04:29:59,460 --> 04:30:02,820
I'll make you pay Got it!

3973
04:30:09,100 --> 04:30:11,100
Hold on, I'm gonna take a...

3974
04:30:12,740 --> 04:30:13,860
A throat...

3975
04:30:16,260 --> 04:30:17,580
What's it called?

3976
04:30:21,850 --> 04:30:22,610
Cough drop.

3977
04:30:30,780 --> 04:30:31,340
Got...

3978
04:30:31,340 --> 04:30:32,320
Um, well...

3979
04:30:36,080 --> 04:30:37,940
We need that thing to come in here.

3980
04:30:39,400 --> 04:30:40,460
Where did it go?

3981
04:30:40,760 --> 04:30:41,980
It took too long.

3982
04:30:43,620 --> 04:30:45,640
Wait, no, I need you in here!

3983
04:30:51,770 --> 04:30:55,150
I need to in here before I open that and that guy ambushes me.

3984
04:30:56,990 --> 04:30:58,350
Oh, here we are.

3985
04:30:58,690 --> 04:30:59,030
Please?

3986
04:31:02,850 --> 04:31:05,210
Down the long hallway goes.

3987
04:31:05,550 --> 04:31:06,630
Come, come, come.

3988
04:31:07,870 --> 04:31:08,530
Come, come.

3989
04:31:16,780 --> 04:31:17,480
Oh, yeah.

3990
04:31:19,680 --> 04:31:20,160
Ouch!

3991
04:31:25,740 --> 04:31:26,520
Oh, whoops.

3992
04:31:26,720 --> 04:31:27,420
That's not what I meant to do.

3993
04:31:29,720 --> 04:31:30,780
Ah, my sanity!

3994
04:31:32,280 --> 04:31:32,620
Yeah!

3995
04:31:40,740 --> 04:31:41,460
Oh my gosh!

3996
04:31:41,900 --> 04:31:42,540
Oh, my sanity!

3997
04:31:43,480 --> 04:31:46,260
Oh, once sanity goes down, then your health starts going down.

3998
04:31:46,440 --> 04:31:46,860
That's right.

3999
04:31:54,540 --> 04:31:55,380
Wait, what was that?

4000
04:31:57,560 --> 04:31:58,720
There's like a loud bang.

4001
04:32:03,030 --> 04:32:03,430
Okay.

4002
04:32:04,330 --> 04:32:05,430
Also, you can't focus.

4003
04:32:05,590 --> 04:32:06,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4004
04:32:09,470 --> 04:32:11,210
It does eventually...

4005
04:32:11,210 --> 04:32:14,270
It's very slow, but it does Build back up.

4006
04:32:22,020 --> 04:32:24,740
Check in here again in case I...

4007
04:32:25,400 --> 04:32:26,680
I guess I...

4008
04:32:26,680 --> 04:32:27,460
I guess it was nothing.

4009
04:32:30,380 --> 04:32:32,800
It only recovers to about that much.

4010
04:32:33,540 --> 04:32:34,100
Yikes!

4011
04:32:34,480 --> 04:32:34,700
Okay.

4012
04:32:35,520 --> 04:32:37,800
Well, I haven't been, like, keeping...

4013
04:32:37,800 --> 04:32:39,380
Do I have anything for Sanity?

4014
04:32:39,860 --> 04:32:41,420
I think I have, like, just...

4015
04:32:47,400 --> 04:32:48,720
Just the Inazushi.

4016
04:32:50,860 --> 04:32:51,900
I don't want to use it on.

4017
04:32:54,780 --> 04:32:57,360
I'm understanding why sanity is good.

4018
04:32:59,040 --> 04:33:00,320
I don't want to use it on.

4019
04:33:00,460 --> 04:33:01,100
Oh, the pills do?

4020
04:33:06,380 --> 04:33:07,400
Oh, nice.

4021
04:33:08,840 --> 04:33:09,120
Okay.

4022
04:33:14,520 --> 04:33:15,040
Let's...

4023
04:33:15,040 --> 04:33:19,880
Oh, the one thing I hate about these areas is they don't have very many save points.

4024
04:33:21,260 --> 04:33:21,680
You know?

4025
04:33:38,330 --> 04:33:39,990
They don't have very many save points.

4026
04:33:40,010 --> 04:33:43,250
So if I die here, I have to redo everything.

4027
04:33:46,530 --> 04:33:50,210
Yeah, you get a save point and you backtrack for it, pretty much.

4028
04:33:53,660 --> 04:33:55,100
Oh, but this is pretty forgiving.

4029
04:33:56,820 --> 04:33:59,800
Because once I switch this, I can just, I can just, okay.

4030
04:34:02,740 --> 04:34:03,880
Maybe I can lead him.

4031
04:34:05,200 --> 04:34:06,380
And it's only two, right?

4032
04:34:06,760 --> 04:34:08,300
Yeah, they're not like, uh, okay.

4033
04:34:13,000 --> 04:34:14,260
Does he walk all the way down?

4034
04:34:14,280 --> 04:34:14,660
the hall?

4035
04:34:20,700 --> 04:34:21,060
Hello?

4036
04:34:22,820 --> 04:34:23,180
Hello?

4037
04:34:24,580 --> 04:34:25,360
You want to come in here?

4038
04:34:25,600 --> 04:34:25,820
No?

4039
04:34:26,540 --> 04:34:27,000
All right.

4040
04:34:31,750 --> 04:34:32,850
Yeah, I remember he is blind.

4041
04:34:33,930 --> 04:34:34,150
Oh, wait.

4042
04:34:34,350 --> 04:34:35,330
He's gonna go in there first.

4043
04:34:37,490 --> 04:34:38,570
Oh, he goes in there?

4044
04:34:39,050 --> 04:34:40,090
Wait, I thought he went down the hall.

4045
04:34:42,070 --> 04:34:42,790
Oh, that sucks.

4046
04:35:09,380 --> 04:35:10,040
Stealth mission.

4047
04:35:12,020 --> 04:35:13,170
I'm just gonna go for it.

4048
04:35:14,820 --> 04:35:15,360
Because I'm scared.

4049
04:35:15,800 --> 04:35:16,680
Oh, save point.

4050
04:35:21,710 --> 04:35:22,090
Okay.

4051
04:35:29,560 --> 04:35:30,240
Okay, good.

4052
04:35:32,620 --> 04:35:34,080
Yeah, I did see something in that room.

4053
04:35:37,160 --> 04:35:38,480
I don't know if he'll come in here.

4054
04:35:43,820 --> 04:35:45,140
Let's see what else is in here.

4055
04:35:45,520 --> 04:35:48,820
Let's check around before I go back in.

4056
04:35:53,120 --> 04:35:54,720
dream is that what it says

4057
04:35:58,470 --> 04:36:53,390
Sakuko's diary my family has served as caretaker of sennenesugi shrine for generations but for the past few decades the shrine's popularity has been on the deep on the decline when it came time for my dad to become the head priest he declined the role and got a regular office job instead oh wow she wanted to be a miiko oh that's right i think i remember her saying that mom and dad are always saying negative things about the shrine that head priests are obsolete even my grandfather says that the tradition of upkeeping sennen sugi shrine will die with his generation no is it because inadi shrine became so popular oh inadi it became so popular in the in the village in the town oh my gosh look at the cute little rabbit on her drawing paper so cute i help out as a miko at the shrine whenever an event's held i love how dignified the rituals are and the way they make me feel like my soul is being cleansed.

4058
04:36:53,710 --> 04:36:56,310
I'd like to be more than just a helper at the shrine.

4059
04:36:57,270 --> 04:36:59,290
I think I'd like to become head priest one day.

4060
04:37:00,150 --> 04:37:00,590
Oh,

4061
04:37:06,600 --> 04:37:07,940
there's a baby in there.

4062
04:37:10,840 --> 04:37:12,560
Let's see what this guy does.

4063
04:37:15,540 --> 04:37:15,960
Does he loop?

4064
04:37:16,500 --> 04:37:17,280
He doesn't even loop.

4065
04:37:27,910 --> 04:37:28,290
Kudzu.

4066
04:37:28,810 --> 04:37:29,550
Ah, no!

4067
04:37:31,230 --> 04:37:33,050
I have too many things.

4074

4076
04:39:05,900 --> 04:39:07,220
I have money.

4077
04:39:07,380 --> 04:39:08,580
I want to spend it.

4078
04:39:09,940 --> 04:39:10,620
Oh, oops, my bad.

4079
04:39:11,080 --> 04:39:12,240
I think I've done that twice now.

4080
04:39:19,260 --> 04:39:19,740
Gotcha!

4081
04:39:20,420 --> 04:39:20,720
Gotcha!

4082
04:39:23,340 --> 04:39:23,820
Okay.

4083
04:39:24,280 --> 04:39:25,940
I have to just deal with the baby.

4084
04:39:30,220 --> 04:39:32,040
And then I can leave.

4085
04:39:34,440 --> 04:39:35,620
Dodge for good luck.

4086
04:39:37,420 --> 04:39:38,920
We'll let this guy leave again.

4087
04:39:40,120 --> 04:39:42,140
all the way down the other hallway, you know?

4088
04:39:43,100 --> 04:39:44,660
Be really nice of him.

4089
04:39:44,940 --> 04:39:44,940
Hello?

4090
04:39:45,300 --> 04:39:45,920
There we go.

4091
04:39:49,460 --> 04:39:50,580
Close up.

4092
04:39:54,860 --> 04:39:55,740
Come in, please!

4093
04:39:56,680 --> 04:39:58,520
Come in, please, so I can handle you.

4094
04:40:06,760 --> 04:40:07,660
Oh, actually?

4095
04:40:10,860 --> 04:40:13,000
You don't see anything.

4096
04:40:26,660 --> 04:40:28,300
Sheet a fine paper.

4097
04:40:28,920 --> 04:40:32,900
Two must face each other as one to pray for mutual prosperity.

4098
04:40:33,320 --> 04:40:34,400
Those who do not shall...

4099
04:40:35,040 --> 04:40:38,660
Wait, those who do shall lift their heads to level...

4100
04:40:38,660 --> 04:40:39,880
I can't read!

4101
04:40:40,280 --> 04:40:45,220
To level height as if they were reflections in a mirror as custom dictates.

4102
04:40:45,820 --> 04:40:48,800
With the shading of light shall you condemn the past to the dark.

4103
04:40:50,640 --> 04:40:51,540
Okay, what?

4104
04:40:52,020 --> 04:40:54,880
So it's another puzzle, but like...

4105
04:40:57,060 --> 04:40:58,720
Oh, wait, do I have to...

4106
04:40:58,720 --> 04:40:59,500
Okay, hold on.

4107
04:41:01,600 --> 04:41:03,100
Hold on, let me read it again.

4108
04:41:08,670 --> 04:41:12,950
Two must face each other as one to pray for mutual prosperity.

4109
04:41:13,330 --> 04:41:16,010
Those who do shall lift their head to level height.

4110
04:41:16,790 --> 04:41:17,090
As if...

4111
04:41:17,090 --> 04:41:17,350
Okay.

4112
04:41:18,530 --> 04:41:19,630
Good luck with this one.

4113
04:41:21,570 --> 04:41:22,070
Okay.

4114
04:41:29,030 --> 04:41:32,710
I'm kind of just wondering what the end goal is though.

4115
04:41:33,810 --> 04:41:36,430
So I have to make all of these cages.

4116
04:41:36,650 --> 04:41:37,810
Oh, there's this part too.

4117
04:41:39,050 --> 04:41:39,930
The same height.

4118
04:41:44,840 --> 04:41:45,600
Oh, but that doesn't.

4119
04:41:47,340 --> 04:41:47,660
Okay.

4120
04:41:47,980 --> 04:41:49,080
Ah, okay.

4121
04:41:50,280 --> 04:41:50,680
Okay.

4122
04:41:53,780 --> 04:41:55,140
The same height.

4123
04:42:11,410 --> 04:42:12,050
Maybe.

4124
04:42:12,790 --> 04:42:13,410
Oh.

4125
04:42:14,630 --> 04:42:15,510
Oh my god.

4126
04:42:22,400 --> 04:42:23,360
Is that not enough?

4127
04:42:25,880 --> 04:42:27,560
Aren't those the only ones that are moving?

4128
04:42:35,640 --> 04:42:36,920
What did I miss?

4129
04:42:42,930 --> 04:42:44,570
I got it?

4130
04:42:49,530 --> 04:42:50,530
Oh, I did it.

4131
04:42:51,810 --> 04:42:53,270
But then nothing happened.

4132
04:42:53,570 --> 04:42:54,530
Oh, there are items inside?

4133
04:42:55,650 --> 04:42:57,030
Oh, I see!

4134
04:43:00,750 --> 04:43:02,190
Oh, okay, hold on.

4135
04:43:02,990 --> 04:43:04,230
Just looking at what each one has.

4136
04:43:09,800 --> 04:43:10,740
Restraint Lampshade.

4137
04:43:11,040 --> 04:43:12,820
Lampshade found near Sakako's cell.

4138
04:43:13,180 --> 04:43:15,500
The design resembles something tangling.

4139
04:43:18,120 --> 04:43:19,160
And then...

4140
04:43:19,160 --> 04:43:20,200
Talon Lampshade.

4141
04:43:20,360 --> 04:43:21,760
The lampshade found near Sakako's cell.

4142
04:43:21,900 --> 04:43:23,760
The design resembles sharp talons.

4143
04:43:24,520 --> 04:43:24,740
Okay.

4144
04:43:35,320 --> 04:43:36,380
Are we turning off the light?

4145
04:43:36,420 --> 04:43:37,520
I had a feeling that we...

4146
04:43:37,520 --> 04:43:41,480
I thought like maybe the turning of those would like turn off the light.

4147
04:43:41,560 --> 04:43:44,020
No, this is so messed up!

4148
04:43:49,080 --> 04:43:51,200
This is so messed up.

4149
04:43:52,000 --> 04:43:55,400
I mean, she's got a big lamp in there, though.

4150
04:43:56,280 --> 04:43:56,860
Poor babies.

4151
04:44:07,570 --> 04:44:09,850
Hina, Hina, Hina, help me.

4152
04:44:10,510 --> 04:44:12,130
Help me, help me.

4153
04:44:14,450 --> 04:44:15,730
Don't go.

4154
04:45:03,240 --> 04:45:04,860
Pretty messed up.

4155
04:45:05,640 --> 04:45:07,660
Obtained after bidding farewell to Sakuko.

4156
04:45:08,300 --> 04:45:10,260
Seems to be able to open a door somewhere, okay.

4157
04:45:14,920 --> 04:45:16,560
I would like to save the game.

4158
04:45:20,220 --> 04:45:21,580
I don't want to watch that again.

4159
04:45:22,060 --> 04:45:22,880
I didn't like that.

4160
04:45:23,180 --> 04:45:24,080
I didn't like that.

4161
04:45:24,480 --> 04:45:25,380
I don't want to watch that again.

4162
04:45:25,780 --> 04:45:27,000
Or it was just 500 yen.

4163
04:45:28,880 --> 04:45:41,820
I didn't Oh, her voice acting was like I can't tell if they're in if it's in the hallway or what Her voice acting was too good though I didn't like it

4164
04:45:52,590 --> 04:46:07,390
Oh Well wait, I give it to the This guy over here That's right I think honestly Like They really were good at making you dislike Rinko.

4165
04:46:07,550 --> 04:46:09,810
We had no reason to dislike Sakuko, you know?

4166
04:46:11,270 --> 04:46:15,990
Hers was totally... It felt so much worse because she felt so innocent, you know?

4167
04:46:25,000 --> 04:46:26,660
What have you been the last time?

4168
04:46:26,780 --> 04:46:27,160
What?

4169
04:46:28,100 --> 04:46:29,340
What the heck is this?

4170
04:46:29,480 --> 04:46:30,220
Oh, laser gun!

4171
04:46:32,380 --> 04:46:32,900
Jisu!

4172
04:46:33,880 --> 04:46:35,320
Thanks for the 200 yen.

4173
04:46:35,860 --> 04:46:37,480
You're a short five!

4174
04:46:38,220 --> 04:46:39,120
I'm just kidding.

4175
04:46:39,900 --> 04:46:41,520
Choose possessions, okay?

4176
04:46:43,200 --> 04:46:44,460
Can I go through here?

4177
04:46:45,920 --> 04:46:46,940
I guess not.

4178
04:46:48,760 --> 04:46:50,260
Space Wars!

4179
04:46:50,760 --> 04:46:51,460
What is this?

4180
04:46:55,340 --> 04:46:55,760
Aww.

4181
04:47:15,000 --> 04:47:15,440
Yeah,

4182
04:47:21,680 --> 04:47:22,520
he sounds in pain.

4183
04:47:28,430 --> 04:47:31,570
Carried not any memory of what has come to pass beyond this point.

4184
04:47:31,670 --> 04:47:33,410
Lay all bare upon the pedestal first.

4185
04:47:33,810 --> 04:47:36,690
The door shall not open to those who harbor regrets in their hearts.

4186
04:47:39,990 --> 04:47:41,970
Was there something that I already have?

4187
04:47:56,270 --> 04:47:59,790
Oh yeah, let's see the portrait in...

4188
04:48:00,670 --> 04:48:01,510
Wait, what's this?

4189
04:48:01,610 --> 04:48:02,110
Memories.

4190
04:48:02,550 --> 04:48:03,010
Oh, okay.

4191
04:48:05,230 --> 04:48:05,670
Info?

4192
04:48:07,350 --> 04:48:08,350
Characters, there we go.

4193
04:48:08,450 --> 04:48:08,810
Sakuko.

4194
04:48:10,410 --> 04:48:12,110
Oh, poor baby!

4195
04:48:13,790 --> 04:48:17,670
I think Sakako may have read one too many of those bizarre comics.

4196
04:48:17,930 --> 04:48:22,970
Lately, she'll be laughing all happily one moment and turn deadly serious and spout off some weird nonsense the next.

4197
04:48:23,410 --> 04:48:26,190
Apparently, she's acting like that because she thinks it's cool.

4198
04:48:26,610 --> 04:48:28,930
But it kind of creeped me out the first few times she did it.

4199
04:48:29,210 --> 04:48:32,370
I hope she gets over this weird supernatural phase of hers.

4200
04:48:32,810 --> 04:48:34,170
She's in middle school!

4201
04:48:35,730 --> 04:48:38,730
This is what all middle schoolers do.

4202
04:48:39,190 --> 04:48:40,410
She's Chuni Byo.

4203
04:48:40,690 --> 04:48:41,490
It's fine.

4204
04:48:47,560 --> 04:48:49,300
Oh, I didn't finish reading these, too.

4205
04:48:50,780 --> 04:48:54,260
I remember Dinko folding up origami all the time.

4206
04:48:54,860 --> 04:49:00,340
I don't know what was on them, but I saw her writing down things during class and folding paper into foxes on multiple occasions.

4207
04:49:00,880 --> 04:49:06,520
She keeps writing her complaints on pieces of paper, but instead of burning them, she just decides to throw them in the void and let them accumulate.

4208
04:49:07,320 --> 04:49:11,440
I think that maybe one day all of those grievances will pile up and suffocate her.

4209
04:49:13,820 --> 04:49:15,420
Or burn her alive.

4210
04:49:20,520 --> 04:49:46,660
a world that's not a playground like elementary school but not as mature as high school middle school to me it was like the stage between a tadpole and a frog i guess you could say it's a period of grotesque transformations up until elementary school shu and i would have water fights and we wouldn't mind if our underwear showed once we entered middle school though while we might not have paid any mind to things like that others around us did it felt like our world changed in a snap

4211
04:49:50,880 --> 04:49:52,560
Sakuko wasn't trying to freak you out.

4212
04:49:52,560 --> 04:49:53,440
No, Hidako!

4213
04:49:55,300 --> 04:50:01,220
Boys and girls used to think of one another as mortal enemy as always bickering and fighting each other.

4214
04:50:01,400 --> 04:50:06,720
But now it suddenly turned into such a weird dynamic where we have to treat each other in a completely different way.

4215
04:50:07,000 --> 04:50:11,140
It's fine for people who want to do that because the people around them are doing the same.

4216
04:50:11,800 --> 04:50:15,520
But for someone like me who really couldn't care less about what people think, that's not the case.

4217
04:50:17,260 --> 04:50:17,700
Sorry.

4218
04:50:19,160 --> 04:50:20,580
Shu and I decided that this place...

4219
04:50:20,780 --> 04:50:23,280
The Chizuru General Store.

4220
04:50:23,740 --> 04:50:27,720
Shu and I decided that this place was the Space Army HQ when we played Space Wars.

4221
04:50:28,840 --> 04:50:32,620
When it wasn't just us playing, we would gather here to have mission briefings while eating candy.

4222
04:50:35,120 --> 04:50:35,540
Okay.

4223
04:50:35,840 --> 04:50:37,060
Oh, save point.

4224
04:50:38,420 --> 04:50:40,600
Why are you doing all the way back here in the corner?

4225
04:50:43,640 --> 04:50:45,360
Fine shoes prize possession.

4226
04:50:45,460 --> 04:50:48,080
You guys, I think I might actually call it here today.

4227
04:50:53,040 --> 04:51:14,680
thing um because i feel like the last or rather rinko and sakoko took so long i don't know how long shoe will take so yeah i think we'll end it here and then we will pick it up next week

4228
04:51:17,840 --> 04:51:26,840
so but i streamed for way longer than i thought i I thought I would be coughing so much too, but I think once I started talking, the coughing went away from me.

4229
04:51:28,800 --> 04:51:30,800
So I'm glad for that.

4230
04:51:30,860 --> 04:51:31,220
Yay!

4231
04:51:33,260 --> 04:51:37,580
So thank you guys for hanging out with me again today.

4232
04:51:38,840 --> 04:51:41,020
I'm starting to get...

4233
04:51:41,020 --> 04:51:43,380
Wait, let's hear what Shu says for this too.

4234
04:51:53,280 --> 04:51:55,800
The question we have right now, are we the baddies?

4235
04:51:55,940 --> 04:51:58,300
I'm really upset about Sakuko, I'm not gonna lie.

4236
04:52:06,980 --> 04:52:10,440
So we don't like Shu in that way.

4237
04:52:10,960 --> 04:52:12,680
You know, we don't romantically like Shu.

4238
04:52:15,280 --> 04:52:20,120
Rinko is upset at us because she thinks that we let him on and she likes him so much.

4239
04:52:20,780 --> 04:52:50,880
but she's upset that he likes us probably some girl asked me to give you this 500 yen to you oh my gosh from baffo caro thank you so much for the 500 yen i'm gonna go buy a pudding with that yeah i bozo and i bozo hi bozo i bozo and then with sakuko though She,

4240
04:52:51,040 --> 04:52:51,200
what?

4241
04:52:51,840 --> 04:52:53,660
Hinako just thought she was a little weird?

4242
04:52:54,340 --> 04:52:55,040
Thanks for the fun stream.

4243
04:52:55,120 --> 04:52:56,340
Looking forward to the lyric video tomorrow.

4244
04:52:56,940 --> 04:52:58,280
Yeah, thanks, Take Me.

4245
04:52:58,460 --> 04:53:00,800
I do have a lyric video coming out of my original song.

4246
04:53:01,400 --> 04:53:08,900
It's just the same performance from me during my 3D debut, my birthday live, but with lyrics.

4247
04:53:09,440 --> 04:53:10,000
So, yeah.

4248
04:53:11,500 --> 04:53:12,640
Thank you for the stream today, Minto.

4249
04:53:12,820 --> 04:53:14,460
I helped me get through cleaning my house today.

4250
04:53:14,800 --> 04:53:17,160
Now it's Extra Clean for Future Ghost Made Hauntings.

4251
04:53:17,520 --> 04:53:19,000
Yeah, good job.

4252
04:53:20,780 --> 04:53:22,480
I hear and don't know what's going on, but here's $5.

4253
04:53:22,680 --> 04:53:23,740
Star creator, thank you!

4254
04:53:23,920 --> 04:53:25,000
Thanks for dropping by.

4255
04:53:27,740 --> 04:53:28,180
Hmm.

4256
04:53:30,080 --> 04:53:32,640
Which doesn't make sense since Hinako plays space wars.

4257
04:53:33,080 --> 04:53:33,860
Plays space wars.

4258
04:53:33,920 --> 04:53:34,780
Wait, what do you mean?

4259
04:53:36,940 --> 04:53:40,220
Feels like less punishing your friends and more like letting them go entirely.

4260
04:53:41,560 --> 04:53:42,000
Yeah.

4261
04:53:42,740 --> 04:53:46,160
