1
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,980
The game is gone.

2
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,320
The game disappeared.

3
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,100
What a mystery, I think.

4
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
It's so quiet.

5
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,740
Hello, everybody.

6
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,020
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

7
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,040
Howdy, howdy, howdy doody.

8
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,240
The first mystery that we must solve.

9
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Oh my gosh, Katsu, happy birthday!

10
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,120
Happy birthday.

11
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,560
Um, hold on, let me get...

12
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Uh...

13
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,200
Konnan shiwa...

14
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,820
Nan shi doru...

15
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Shama, hold on.

16
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,760
This is my center of operations, my desk.

17
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,260
Go ahead and poke around.

18
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,520
If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do, take a look at the book titled How to Be a Detective.

19
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,820
It's really helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery-solving business.

20
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,750
And be sure to check out my scrapbook.

21
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,660
I put memorabilia from all my past cases in there.

22
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,960
A lot of them were pretty dangerous and at times really scary.

23
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,540
But don't say anything about that to my dad, okay?

24
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:24,980
Okay.

25
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,460
He worries about me enough as it is.

26
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,480
Dang, she's a yapper.

27
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,460
And whatever you do, read what's in the file called Case File.

28
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:31,760
Okay.

29
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,840
That'll tell you all about the mystery I'm about to try to solve.

30
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,180
Okay.

31
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,980
Okay.

32
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,000
If you think you're ready to dive into that mystery, just click on the plane ticket and you'll be on your way.

33
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,560
Okay.

34
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,600
Yay!

35
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,080
Katsu, let me sing your happy birthday before I forget.

36
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,300
Let's do it.

37
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,640
Happy birthday to you.

38
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,040
Happy birthday to you.

39
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,860
Happy birthday dear Katsu.

40
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,260
Happy birthday to you.

41
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,040
Happy birthday!

42
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,660
I have talked about wanting to play an MC Drew games before.

43
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,840
So...

44
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,660
Finally!

45
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,380
I thought this one would be fun to play because...

46
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,880
It's...

47
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,360
I think it's like kind of like a cringe kinono to have her be in Japan.

48
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,640
Thanks for haunting yesterday, Mita!

49
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,640
I got a doctor's appointment for my wrist.

50
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,240
Oh!

51
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:36,620
Good!

52
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,920
Good.

53
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,420
Oh, gosh.

54
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,580
Wait.

55
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,560
It's what I'll say in November.

56
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,380
Oh.

57
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,860
So...

58
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,380
So...

59
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,540
I can't...

60
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,620
It's kind of...

61
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,520
So if I exit out of the game...

62
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,780
Or if I tab out...

63
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,260
Hold on.

64
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,220
Uh...

65
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,560
Wait.

66
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,360
Uh...

67
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,820
Hold on.

68
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,180
Wait.

69
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,720
Wait.

70
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,360
Hold on.

71
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,760
My brain is a little scrambled today.

72
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,080
Um...

73
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,180
If I...

74
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,820
Miss super chat...

75
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:04,720
I...

76
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
Have to...

77
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,500
Tab...

78
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,480
Out of game...

79
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,760
And I...

80
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,860
Miss...

81
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,480
Wait.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,600
I...

83
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,200
Uh...

84
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,840
Oh...

85
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,740
I...

86
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,540
I might...

87
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Miss...

88
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,760
Uh...

89
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,480
You guys!

90
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,940
It's not Tendi's birthday!

91
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,600
He said it's his birthday in November!

92
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,020
But also...

93
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,060
Happy early birthday!

94
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,060
Haun!

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
Happy early birthday.

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
Good luck with your appointment.

97
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,300
Okay.

98
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,620
Uh...

99
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,260
Okay.

100
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,600
See, you can hear the game now.

101
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,760
You can hear the game, right?

102
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,100
Oh no!

103
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,000
I lost the chat!

104
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,040
Oh my gosh!

105
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,200
It's old game!

106
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,640
So it's kind of like...

107
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,040
It's old game!

108
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,080
And then...

109
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,780
You can see...

110
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,140
My cursor...

111
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,920
Is...

112
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,320
It...

113
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,480
It...

114
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,500
It cannot escape.

115
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,760
Is someone mowing the lawn?

116
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,260
What is this?

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,240
Dad...

118
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,600
Dad simulator...

119
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,260
Dad simulator...

120
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,780
Oh yeah!

121
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,840
It's Saturday morning!

122
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,360
But anyway!

123
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,120
So yeah!

124
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,380
I wanted to...

125
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:14,860
Kind of...

126
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,740
I wanted to play...

127
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,920
The Nancy Drew game!

128
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,500
Just because I wanted to play one for...

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,360
For my own...

130
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,460
Silly reasons!

131
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,280
Cause whatever!

132
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,600
My mic sounds different!

133
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,980
Muffle?

134
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,280
It's literally the same mic I've been using!

135
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,580
It's the same mic I've been using!

136
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,770
Bit muted!

137
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,250
Really?

138
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,750
Did you mess around with settings?

139
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,870
For the ASMR?

140
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,630
Oh!

141
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,250
You know what?

142
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:53,770
Oh!

143
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,210
Well...

144
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,350
Not on my...

145
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,450
Well...

146
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,350
I use a different mic...

147
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,810
Hold on...

148
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,450
Let me see...

149
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,950
Yesterday was my first ASMR experience...

150
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,890
It was actually really fun...

151
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,630
I hope you do more...

152
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,190
Thank you!

153
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,570
Hold on...

154
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,450
Let me try...

155
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,250
Hold on...

156
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,050
What's it called?

157
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,340
Let's try...

158
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,780
Does that sound better?

159
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,900
No...

160
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,480
Ah...

161
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,180
Ah...

162
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,900
Oh, wait...

163
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,380
Does that sound...

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,800
Oh!

165
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,640
I think...

166
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,140
Ah, ah, ah...

167
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,340
Oh!

168
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,840
That does actually sound better!

169
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,740
Ah...

170
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,140
I think...

171
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,300
That sounds better...

172
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,300
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

173
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,740
It was just a different...

174
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,520
Preset...

175
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,040
How...

176
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,440
No...

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
My stuff is all messed up...

178
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,680
I didn't change any of the preset though...

179
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,900
That's so strange...

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,040
Mmm...

181
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,480
Hot dog!

182
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,020
Hot dog!

183
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,600
That didn't change anything though...

184
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,440
Oh, the only thing I changed was...

185
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,060
Uh...

186
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,960
I had to like...

187
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,340
Do the stereo output...

188
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,660
But...

189
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,460
It shouldn't have changed anything else...

190
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,180
Maybe I accidentally did...

191
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,940
Oh, well...

192
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,220
We're fine now...

193
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,500
Ha, ha, ha...

194
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,980
Sounding better...

195
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,600
Sorry about that...

196
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,600
Isn't Nancy Drew an old people thing though?

197
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,100
What do you mean old people?

198
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,940
I did see some people being like...

199
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Oh, this is my childhood...

200
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh my god...

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
But I didn't play this game...

202
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,900
Oops...

203
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,180
Sorry...

204
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,620
That long ago...

205
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,120
Brother...

206
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
I've never played these games before...

207
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,020
I've only watched people play them...

208
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,920
Ha, ha, ha...

209
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,140
So...

210
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,540
This is...

211
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,420
This is new to me...

212
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,120
Also, I'm glad you fell asleep too...

213
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,920
The ASMR...

214
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,240
He, he, he...

215
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,880
I'm glad that it...

216
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,700
Um...

217
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,440
That it...

218
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,420
That it worked...

219
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,140
Thanks for the spooky number too...

220
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
He, he, he, he...

221
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,880
So happy I could see you again at Anime Ottawa...

222
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,560
Sorry for spilling my spaghetti...

223
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,140
Ha, ha, ha...

224
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,520
I also...

225
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,200
I also...

226
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,140
Didn't expect to be at Anime Ottawa...

227
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,720
Everything was so...

228
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,180
All over the place for me...

229
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,140
This weekend...

230
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,700
But...

231
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah...

232
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,360
Um...

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,520
Konnichiwa...

234
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,240
Nancy desu...

235
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,480
Yeah...

236
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,340
Wait, these games are older than 30?

237
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,760
No, they're not...

238
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,020
How...

239
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,140
Wait, when did this game come out?

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,420
Actually, I have no idea...

241
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:28,920
Let's see...

242
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,940
Nancy...

243
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,440
Drew...

244
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,940
N...

245
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,860
Nancy...

246
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,140
Drew...

247
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,640
Which one is this?

248
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,340
Shadow...

249
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,760
Arigato, arigato...

250
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,940
Chuuu...

251
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,600
Chuuu...

252
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,760
Oh!

253
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
Wait, hold on...

254
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh my gosh, sorry...

255
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,480
I keep having to...

256
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,460
Tab out...

257
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,300
I forgot to...

258
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,700
Make the notice not...

259
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,020
See through...

260
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,600
Ha, ha, ha...

261
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,860
Let me do this...

262
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
And this...

263
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,600
Okie dokie...

264
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,520
It's been two months since the jazz karaoke...

265
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,700
Won't ask for child support...

266
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,840
Just request you wish me happy birthday...

267
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,540
Brendan, happy birthday!

268
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,160
Why?

269
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,760
Um... I'm sorry, but if...

270
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,920
I don't think a baby is born in two months, okay?

271
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,920
The game is from 2010...

272
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,660
But it's the 23rd game!

273
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,160
It gives...

274
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,940
It does kind of give like an older vibe though, no?

275
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,500
Than 2010...

276
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,860
It's kind of like when you see Japanese videos from like 2006...

277
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,040
And you're like, wow, this looks like the 80s...

278
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,280
Ha, ha, ha...

279
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,860
But Brendan, happy birthday!

280
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,100
Happy birthday to you!

281
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,280
Happy birthday to you!

282
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,560
Happy birthday, dear Brendan!

283
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,400
Happy birthday to you!

284
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,000
This seems way older than 2010...

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,040
Maybe they just kept the same...

286
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,240
Maybe they just never updated their graphics...

287
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,680
Let's see...

288
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,940
How to be a detective...

289
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,200
By Nancy Drew...

290
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,560
What's new?

291
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,080
As always, your mission is to solve the mystery...

292
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,300
By stepping into my shoes...

293
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,920
And deciding my every move...

294
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
Why is she saying that?

295
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh please...

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,340
You may occasionally see a question mark...

297
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,360
In the upper right corner of the top mat...

298
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
If you click on it, it'll bring up a tip...

299
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,420
On how to manipulate the current puzzle...

300
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,520
Your cell phone has lots of features...

301
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,260
Phone, camera, clock, messages, and settings...

302
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,120
When you have a cell phone?

303
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,680
That's how you know it's not so old...

304
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:35,740
Each mode can be accessed...

305
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,360
By selecting its icon from the main menu...

306
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,980
Phone mode stores all the numbers you'll need to know...

307
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,140
I wanna be ninja-lady...

308
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,100
Scroll through to the name of the correct contact...

309
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,340
And press call...

310
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,520
Be sure to check in with Bess and George from time to time...

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,440
Tempo!

312
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,180
Nice!

313
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,160
It was happy to see you too...

314
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,240
Even though it was...

315
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,600
Through phone to phone!

316
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,180
But um...

317
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,820
What I also like about this game...

318
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
Is Nancy...

319
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,640
It's all like fully...

320
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,180
Narrated...

321
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,500
So I don't have to talk as much...

322
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,340
Which is great for my throat, baby!

323
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,760
What?

324
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,300
No...

325
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,980
Wait, what is this?

326
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,120
Use the options button in Contacts...

327
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,300
To go to the scrollable gallery of available images...

328
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,280
Camera mode allows you to take and view photos...

329
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,480
When in camera mode...

330
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,260
You can zoom in and pan...

331
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,140
Before taking a picture...

332
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,440
Click on view photos...

333
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
To see your saved photos...

334
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,940
Set your alarm to take a break...

335
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,720
And wake up hours later...

336
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,980
By entering clock mode...

337
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,220
Any text messages you receive...

338
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,100
Will show up in the messages mode...

339
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,540
Oh gosh...

340
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm not paying attention at all...

341
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,060
And the settings menu...

342
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,880
To personalize the look of your phone...

343
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,280
By choosing one of the options...

344
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,580
In each drop down...

345
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,860
I'm not paying attention at all...

346
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,460
I'm sorry...

347
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,540
Who wants to be...

348
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,600
Who wants to...

349
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,740
Who wants to be...

350
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,460
How to Drop Manga 101...

351
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
Character B...

352
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,240
As their...

353
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,200
As their profile picture...

354
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,220
In my...

355
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,560
In my phone...

356
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,060
As of my contact...

357
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,060
Now that's early 2000s...

358
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,780
It's...

359
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,060
Oh my...

360
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,420
It's so good...

361
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh my gosh...

362
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,380
So we got a camera...

363
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,060
We have an alarm...

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,560
And text messages...

365
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,160
Okay...

366
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,620
To get from one place to another in the game...

367
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,340
Just move your cursor around on the screen...

368
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,600
And click when an arrow pointing in the direction you want to go...

369
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Appears...

370
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,140
An arrow pointing forward allows you to go forward...

371
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,360
While a back arrow allows you to step back...

372
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,140
Sometimes up and down arrows are available too...

373
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,580
Give it a try...

374
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,500
Find the forward arrow...

375
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,820
And check out Mr. Woogle Woggle...

376
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,500
He's my teddy bear...

377
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,940
Mr. Woogle...

378
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,380
Oh wait...

379
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,140
There it is...

380
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,580
When you want to turn around...

381
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,840
Move your cursor to the bottom of the screen...

382
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,500
Until it turns into an arrow that looks like a U-turn...

383
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,200
Or back arrow...

384
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,120
And click...

385
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,760
Where is it?

386
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,540
Up there...

387
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,360
Mr. Woogle Woggle...

388
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,640
She got nothing to say about him...

389
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
He's in pristine condition though...

390
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,780
If that were my bear...

391
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,500
His eyes would be ripped out...

392
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,740
His nose would be ripped out...

393
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,140
His arms would be ripped off...

394
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,660
His ears would be ripped off...

395
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,960
His legs would be ripped off...

396
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
His stomach would be exposed...

397
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,880
I always use my magnifying glass to scan my surroundings for clues...

398
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,760
When it turns red...

399
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,800
I know I'm on to something...

400
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,500
When your magnifying glass turns into a question mark...

401
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,900
You can talk to someone...

402
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,940
When it becomes a hand, you can use it to open and close things, pick up objects, and move things around.

403
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,540
To see how this works, move your mouse over this scene until the magnifying glass turns red.

404
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,380
Then click to zoom in.

405
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,040
See how the magnifying glass...

406
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,440
When you click on an object with a hand cursor...

407
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,940
To see what's in your inventory, just click on the inventory icon at the...

408
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,220
I keep reminders to myself in my journal.

409
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,540
Click on the notebook icon at the bottom left of the screen, and you'll see what I mean.

410
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:04,220
The gear icon allows you to determine how questioning suspects is something all detectives need to know how to do.

411
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,540
In the game, to get people to talk to you, all you have to do is click on them.

412
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,500
Skipper, skipper, skipper.

413
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,420
Before you can start playing, you need to decide whether to play as a junior or senior detective.

414
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,340
If you choose junior detective, you'll get more hints than you will if you're a senior detective.

415
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,580
And the puzzles will be a little easier.

416
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,080
When you're ready to start playing, just click on the plane tickets and hang on to your hat.

417
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,920
Thanks!

418
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,560
Thanks, Miss Nancy!

419
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,180
Senior detective!

420
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,580
What's this?

421
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,360
We got...

422
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,220
Utter pops.

423
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,140
Cream-filled lollipops.

424
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,660
Miss Nancy Drew!

425
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,020
Ummm!

426
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,300
Sorry!

427
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,520
Oh...

428
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,800
Coco C Laneicle!

429
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,560
Milk chocolate crunchies.

430
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:03,880
Yummy.

431
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,700
Crunchy.

432
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,800
Coco- Latte.

433
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,080
It's, very cow!

434
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,360
exaggeration,

435
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,190
Moons-chunk.

436
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,290
Out of this world shoots you snau- It's just a, It's a disk of cheese.

437
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,870
That's what she does.

438
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,850
Never mind, okay.

439
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,790
What's this one?

440
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,390
Licky-loo lollipops.

441
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,050
Thousands of flavors?

442
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,150
Why is she obsessed with cows?

443
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,770
Is this like Nancy Drew lore?

444
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,530
Oh my god, ma'am, stop slurping in my ear.

445
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,390
Raging infernos.

446
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,950
Fiery cinnamon balls.

447
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,210
Why is it all cow-related?

448
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,850
I don't know.

449
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,150
What's this?

450
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,230
A scrapbook.

451
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,590
Oh!

452
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,670
Wow!

453
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,450
Wait, so we're on the 14th game?

454
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,070
Sorry, we're on the 23rd game.

455
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,330
Let's see.

456
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,330
Wow.

457
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,850
This is a lot of stuff.

458
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:32,210
A student was found dead at the bottom of a flight of stairs at Paseo Del Mar High School, where my aunt Eloise... Eloise... Eloise was the librarian.

459
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,450
This was the one case I almost didn't survive.

460
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,340
Damn!

461
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,020
Case 2.

462
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,420
Stay tuned for danger.

463
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,760
Oh my god.

464
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,380
What is... The very first case.

465
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,520
She almost didn't survive.

466
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,620
I like this.

467
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,560
Corner diner.

468
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,520
School library.

469
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,400
Locker hall.

470
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,520
Study dome.

471
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,740
Even the dark, dank basement boiler room.

472
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,800
Wow.

473
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,920
As if living in the Big Apple wasn't exciting enough, I got to mingle with actors, agents, producers.

474
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,800
I even saved Rick...

475
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,960
Arlen's life.

476
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,500
Wow!

477
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,780
Looks like one of those free CD games you get out of a cereal box.

478
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,320
Case number three.

479
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,320
Message in a haunted mansion.

480
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,280
When it comes to ghosts?

481
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,980
I have never been much of a believer.

482
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,300
But I have to admit, this case made me wonder.

483
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,180
Rick Astley, maybe.

484
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,800
Number four.

485
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,620
Treasure in the Royal Tower.

486
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,640
I headed to Wickford Castle in Wisconsin, hoping to do a little skiing.

487
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,480
But a blizzard shut me and a handful of others in and kept everyone else out.

488
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,500
Uh-oh.

489
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,060
She hates me.

490
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
She hates me.

491
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,600
Case number five.

492
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,600
The final scene.

493
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
I wonder if they were going to make this the last Nancy Drew game.

494
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,180
And they're like, nope.

495
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,020
The last thing I expected when I agreed to go with a friend to the Palladium Theater in St. Louis was that she would vanish.

496
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,520
Oh my god!

497
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,400
That's kidnapping.

498
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,160
Secret of the Scarlet Hand.

499
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:30,640
Okay.

500
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,420
I found myself embroiled in a mystery involving art, antiquities, and subterfuge.

501
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,960
What is that?

502
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,720
Ghost dogs of Moon Lake?

503
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,100
What in the...

504
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,180
What in the...

505
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,640
Uh...

506
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,040
Sherlock Holmes is this?

507
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,400
The case started innocently enough.

508
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,340
My friend Sally McDonald invited me out to the house she'd just bought on Moon Lake.

509
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:08,840
But the night before I arrived, a pack of dogs with glowing eyes showed up in the middle of the night, barking and snarling and trying to get into the house, which scared Sally so bad that she dropped everything and fled!

510
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,480
Hmm...

511
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Twinkle dogs?

512
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,220
Twinkle dogs?

513
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,500
The haunted carousel?

514
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay.

515
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,240
Talk about your wild rides.

516
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,640
Why did her handwriting change?

517
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,260
Maybe they thought it would be too difficult to read.

518
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,740
Danger on Deception Island.

519
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,700
Antarctica?

520
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,800
Wait, no.

521
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,680
Pacific Northwest.

522
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:48,060
Oh my gosh, there's an actual place in Antarctica called Deception Island where it's actually a... it's like an active volcano.

523
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,840
And you can dig into the snow and it will like... they used to... like there's a little research base there.

524
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,620
I don't think it's used anymore.

525
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,480
Because it's kind of dangerous.

526
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,280
But you can dig into the snow and like... it will start boiling.

527
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,700
Like you can make your own little bath in the snow.

528
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,500
It's kind of cool.

529
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,490
Yeah.

530
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,030
This one's way lamer.

531
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,830
Probably.

532
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,030
The Secret of Shadow Ranch.

533
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:22,730
Oh.

534
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,910
Wait, her handwriting's back.

535
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:25,850
Yay.

536
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:26,370
Yep.

537
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,930
Okay.

538
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,270
Ghost towns, cowboys, horses.

539
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,190
Rattlesnakes.

540
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,790
This case had everything.

541
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,090
I was supposed to be vacationing at Shadow Ranch in Arizona with Bess and George there.

542
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,490
And an uncle owned the place.

543
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,390
But soon after I arrived, this glowing horse appeared out of nowhere.

544
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,490
Curse of Blackmoor Manor.

545
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,650
Whoa.

546
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,510
This one looks wild.

547
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,310
What is going on here?

548
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,470
Secret of the old clock.

549
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:58,810
Okay.

550
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,890
Um, Nancy Drew goes back in time.

551
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,030
No internet.

552
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,770
No television.

553
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,710
Living in 1930 wasn't exactly a piece of cake.

554
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,710
That's for sure.

555
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,170
Nor was investigating the mysterious occurrences at an inn run by a friend of mine and her guardian.

556
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,290
What?

557
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,400
Why is it...

558
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,120
Did she actually go back in time?

559
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,540
The series is great.

560
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,600
Detective Mito on the case.

561
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:31,960
Yeah.

562
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,900
Last train to Blue Moon Canyon.

563
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:36,860
Okay.

564
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,320
Look at these guys.

565
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:38,740
Wow.

566
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,680
Look at all this...

567
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Look at this cast of characters.

568
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,760
Tino.

569
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,500
Tino looks awfully sus.

570
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,080
My best egg.

571
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,800
Welcome to membership.

572
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,560
Thank you.

573
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,520
Danger by design.

574
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,460
Oh, she went to Florence.

575
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,800
Oh, we, we.

576
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,500
The creature of Kapu Cave in Hawaii.

577
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,660
Nancy's been everywhere.

578
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,020
Where does she get the money for this?

579
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,140
Do people pay her for solving these cases?

580
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,880
The white wolf of Icicle Creek.

581
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,120
Legend of the Crystal Skull.

582
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,020
Wait.

583
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,660
Wait a second.

584
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,400
Indie?

585
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,640
Indiana Jones?

586
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,440
I haven't played these in a long time, but...

587
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,160
In case you can die from eating the wrong sandwich.

588
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,780
Wait, what?

589
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,080
The Phantom of Venice.

590
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,980
Oh.

591
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,340
There I was in Venice, Italy, working undercover, surrounded by canals, gondolas, and romance.

592
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,980
I was in Detective Heaven.

593
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,240
Unfortunately, a thief known as the Phantom.

594
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,500
Wait, it's a phantom thief?

595
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,580
Proved to be a little more elusive and a lot more dangerous than I had counted on.

596
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,400
Ooh.

597
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,700
Haunting of Castle Malloy.

598
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,760
Well, we're getting real international now.

599
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,660
This is Ireland.

600
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,520
Ransom of the Seven Ships!

601
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,260
Bahamas.

602
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,940
Warnings at Waverly Academy.

603
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,480
Okay.

604
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,360
The black cat is watching.

605
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:36,200
I like how they wrote this and then, like, did the claw marks, but, like, went around it.

606
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,400
Trail of the Twister.

607
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,400
This poor guy.

608
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,740
Give him a reshoot.

609
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,640
Give this guy...

610
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,760
This is the, like, worst picture ever of him.

611
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,200
Oh, and that's it.

612
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,660
Nice.

613
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,740
And here we are.

614
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,220
About to go to Japan.

615
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,360
Let's read our case file.

616
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,240
Or I think Nancy will read it for us.

617
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,960
After a string of tough mysteries, I've decided it's time to take a break to do a little sightseeing.

618
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:13,980
I'm taking PG Crowmeister up on his offer to send me to his favorite Ria-Con, or traditional inn, in Kyoto, Japan.

619
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:22,720
I'll spend the days teaching English, and my nights with Bess and George, exploring the sights, fashion, history, and nightlife of downtown Kyoto.

620
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,180
From what I hear, the inn I'm staying at is known as one of the scariest places in the city.

621
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,420
The Ria-Con.

622
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,800
I'm not sure why people say that.

623
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,880
I might have to poke around a little to see what's really going on at the Ria-Con-hie.

624
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,320
The Ria-Con.

625
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,920
Spank, thank you so much for the 10 gift.

626
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,600
Thank you.

627
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,680
The Ria-Con.

628
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,820
Look, there's even a pachinko place right here.

629
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,260
Okay, nice.

630
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,640
The Ria-Con.

631
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,240
Is that it?

632
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,720
All right.

633
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,900
Are you guys ready?

634
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,960
What else is here?

635
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,080
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

636
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,400
Oh.

637
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,320
I guess I'm a senior detective.

638
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,680
Oh.

639
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,580
Ducky,

640
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,350
thanks for the first time.

641
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:13,390
So.

642
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,710
Wow.

643
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,530
So Japanese.

644
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,330
Take off your shoes, Nancy Drew.

645
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,250
Oh.

646
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,610
Okay.

647
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,670
Oh.

648
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,530
She's really into that painting.

649
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,230
Oh.

650
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,370
Konnichiwa.

651
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:30,550
Hi.

652
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,630
I have a reservation under Nancy Drew.

653
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,150
Oh my god.

654
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,250
Do you believe me now?

655
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,670
Obasan, it only fell.

656
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,650
Obasan!

657
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,630
It did not.

658
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,610
You know better.

659
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,390
I'm very sorry.

660
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,410
She...

661
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,210
She's just a little upset.

662
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,350
She does not want her here.

663
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,830
Tell her to go.

664
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:58,570
Now.

665
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,030
What was that about?

666
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,490
Why is she upset?

667
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,410
Please.

668
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,870
Don't worry about that.

669
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,590
Here.

670
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,210
This is your room key.

671
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,730
Thank you.

672
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,150
Why do I hear like a security camera?

673
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,570
Okay.

674
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,750
We...

675
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,250
We...

676
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,870
We just got here.

677
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,010
Nihongo jousu, Nancy Drew.

678
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,950
She didn't even try.

679
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,670
I literally wanted to hear her be like, Konnichiwa.

680
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,170
Otashiwa.

681
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,530
Ne...

682
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,090
Nancy Drew.

683
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,550
Deshi.

684
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,690
Uh...

685
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,870
Yowyaku ga arimasu.

686
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,650
Cool.

687
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,310
Room 24.

688
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,230
Spooky.

689
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,630
Thanks.

690
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,390
Your room is on the second floor.

691
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,070
I've already heard your back.

692
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,790
sent up.

693
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,470
Please.

694
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,850
My name's Miwako.

695
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,290
Come to me if there's anything you need.

696
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,310
Thank you.

697
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,510
Oh, it's...

698
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,210
What the hell is that?

699
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,140
That's the security camera I'm hearing.

700
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,580
Literally got lost for an hour on this game because I wasn't paying attention to my hotel number.

701
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:02,880
No.

702
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,540
Is that a robotic cat?

703
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,460
Yeah, Suki.

704
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,160
Isn't she the greatest?

705
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,980
Lentaro got her for me.

706
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,120
I've wanted my own pet cat for forever, but I can't have one at the ryokan.

707
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:17,980
Ryokan?

708
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,280
I came into work one day, and there she was, right next to the sweetest note from Lentaro.

709
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,780
No refund.

710
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,060
I've never seen a robotic cat before.

711
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,480
What does it do?

712
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,980
She's not on it.

713
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,800
She's Suki.

714
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,260
Oh.

715
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:30,900
It's okay.

716
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,040
She didn't mean it.

717
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,720
Actually, she doesn't really do much.

718
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,480
Mainly sits.

719
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,480
But...

720
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:36,900
Oh, wait.

721
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,380
I just learned something neat.

722
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:38,980
It's terrifying.

723
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,120
Suki, date.

724
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,660
Oh, it stands up too?

725
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,300
Oh, okay.

726
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,160
Now it's kind of cute.

727
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,260
Oh, that's great.

728
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,500
That's all I remember right now.

729
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,120
But she can do a lot more.

730
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,680
Japan.

731
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,980
I should figure out what the rest of the commands are, come to think of it.

732
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,960
Although, to be honest, it's a little more believable if she just does what she wants.

733
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:01,780
Fuck.

734
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,780
Hold on.

735
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,220
Let me...

736
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,400
I'm gonna also move this over just a tiny tad.

737
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,280
Oh.

738
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,020
Let's do this.

739
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,080
Just so that you guys can see everything.

740
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,720
I don't want to be blocking anything.

741
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,220
That should be good.

742
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,840
That should be better.

743
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,480
Okay.

744
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,040
This thing is...

745
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,640
I don't know if I like Suki.

746
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,640
I think Suki is a little...

747
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,360
I don't think I Suki-Suki.

748
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,100
I think I...

749
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,100
What in the FNAF?

750
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,000
Is that its teeth?

751
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,600
Or...

752
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,100
It's just a little...

753
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,860
I think if it was more robot and less realistic looking, it would be cuter.

754
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,160
Suki-Tate.

755
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,560
Your grandmother seemed very upset about the portrait.

756
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,520
Your grandmother seemed very upset about the portrait breaking.

757
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,180
I mean...

758
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,920
It's no big deal.

759
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,480
She thinks it's a bad sign that the portrait fell from the wall.

760
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,900
Why is that?

761
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,640
It's a very special portrait.

762
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,140
It's one of the two remaining images of my mother and it was taken shortly before...

763
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,280
It's one of my grandmother's favorite portraits.

764
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,460
She's trauma dumping on us.

765
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,680
Interesting.

766
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,860
One thing I love about Nancy Drew is she is the nosiest lady ever.

767
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,320
She's got to stick her butt in everything.

768
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Like, clearly it's a sensitive subject.

769
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,540
And she's like, yeah, I just met you.

770
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,000
What happened?

771
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,480
Yeah, I'm not even friends with you.

772
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,760
What happened to your mother?

773
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,540
I shouldn't bother you with our problems, Nancy.

774
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,620
Please.

775
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,340
It is very nice outside.

776
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,460
A perfect time to relax and enjoy your surroundings.

777
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,400
Oh, wait.

778
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:44,820
No, wait.

779
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,780
What's our... Hi.

780
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,720
Hi.

781
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,100
What is a ryokan?

782
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
What is a ryokan?

783
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,020
A ryokan is almost exactly like a hotel or a spa, but far more traditional.

784
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,380
This ryokan has been in my family for generations.

785
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,860
Passed down from mother to oldest daughter in order to preserve the traditional style, the food, the caretaking.

786
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,020
Every little detail is as it would have been generations ago.

787
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,860
How long has the ryokan been in your family?

788
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,400
A very long time.

789
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,320
My grandmother says it has been passed down since the early 1700s.

790
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:19,680
Wow.

791
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,000
So one day you'll pass this place on to your daughter?

792
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,720
That must be very nice.

793
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,640
I didn't know she has a daughter.

794
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,020
Well, I'm the younger daughter.

795
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,320
My older sister, Yumi, will be the one to take over the ryokan.

796
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,340
Oh.

797
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh.

798
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,820
My grandmother is offering a few classes in traditional arts.

799
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,740
She's in room 18 at the end of the hall.

800
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,860
Okay.

801
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,280
I'll let you get back to work.

802
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,620
I'll let you get back to work.

803
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,660
See you later.

804
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,760
Bye.

805
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,620
Alright, what do we got here?

806
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,640
Doru-sama.

807
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,060
Williams-sama.

808
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,340
Schneider-sama.

809
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,560
Miura-sama.

810
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,160
Herman-sama.

811
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,300
Mint the disembodied cat head is giving me a bad trip.

812
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,600
It's just so awkward, right?

813
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,320
Nancy, please be careful.

814
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,300
There's too much broken glass.

815
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:11,960
My bad.

816
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,920
I'm just a nosy, nosy lady.

817
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,760
God.

818
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,320
So nosy.

819
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,500
Whoa.

820
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,000
Whoa.

821
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,000
Ooh.

822
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,620
Nancy, don't stick your hand in the fire.

823
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,020
Please don't hang anything up there.

824
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,880
Okay.

825
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,560
Sorry.

826
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm getting scolded.

827
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,820
Guys would love this place.

828
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,680
We're in Kyoto, Japan.

829
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,780
This is as authentic as it gets.

830
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,420
What else?

831
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:35,800
What else we got?

832
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,580
Anything else?

833
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,700
Hmm.

834
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,760
Oh, no.

835
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,280
We could leave without side.

836
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh.

837
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,660
Hello?

838
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,660
Hello.

839
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,860
Nancy, you made it.

840
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,900
How was your ride?

841
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,220
It was pretty good.

842
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,820
We need to get Bessa.

843
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,300
I love Japan.

844
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,300
I have done so much shopping, and George's convention is crazy.

845
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,360
We need to give her a... a phone, a picture.

846
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,300
I've never seen so many people.

847
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,880
It's totally sold out.

848
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,700
You sound pretty excited.

849
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,700
Well, yeah.

850
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,420
Kinda hard not to be here.

851
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:05,900
Well, yeah.

852
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,120
I don't even know where to start.

853
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,960
Have you ever had mochi?

854
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,920
It's a revelation, Nancy.

855
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm not even kidding.

856
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,400
And the shopping.

857
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,140
Conference me in already.

858
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
Mochi ice cream, yeah.

859
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:16,780
Okay.

860
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,180
Does that do it?

861
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,380
No?

862
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,040
Okay.

863
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,280
No, hit the...

864
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,420
No, the...

865
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,020
J-Rock.

866
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,980
You do it, then.

867
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,480
We all on?

868
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,280
Yes.

869
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,020
Yep.

870
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,360
Why is that so hard?

871
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,080
It so isn't.

872
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,460
Anyway, what's your story?

873
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,620
What are you up to?

874
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,480
You coming over?

875
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,620
I'm still getting settled in, but I'll be out to see you guys soon.

876
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,340
Everyone's so eccentric.

877
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,720
How's the...

878
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,260
Whatever it is you're staying at?

879
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,900
Reacon.

880
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,860
It's great.

881
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,820
A little strange, though.

882
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,740
When I was checking in, a picture fell off the wall, and everyone was really weird about it.

883
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,460
Huh.

884
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,700
Oh, no.

885
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,400
Our train's going to be here in a sec.

886
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,100
Gotta go.

887
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,320
See you, Nancy.

888
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,080
Bye.

889
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,140
Bye.

890
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,380
Wait, if you guys were standing right next to each other, why didn't you just...

891
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,560
Why didn't you just...

892
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Just have...

893
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,280
Talk together.

894
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,290
Instead of...

895
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,100
Paging...

896
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,020
Paging her in.

897
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,500
Alright, we got...

898
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,140
I need a dictionary to translate that.

899
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,720
Oh, no!

900
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,440
She's illiterate!

901
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,220
Do you know what the kanji says?

902
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,740
Kairos!

903
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,720
Thank you for the 20th!

904
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,620
Thank you so much!

905
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,040
Ryokan.

906
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,220
That's right!

907
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,500
Densha!

908
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,920
I'm guessing... I can't read the first kanji, but this is Kinshi, so it probably is like...

909
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,980
Probably like no traffic or like no... cars or whatever.

910
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,880
And then Kyoto...

911
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,240
What is this...

912
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,320
I need to translate that.

913
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
What is that, kian?

914
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,440
Which is no smoking.

915
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,520
No driving.

916
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,580
Yeah.

917
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,780
Will there be any cosplay girls at a RiaCon?

918
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,120
Yeah, the RiaCon.

919
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,040
Oh my gosh, we're at the RiaCon!

920
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,200
Wow!

921
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,380
I've always wanted...

922
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,280
Where are we?

923
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,640
I've always wanted to go!

924
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:08,920
Oh!

925
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,720
Oh, okay.

926
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,440
What's...

927
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,500
What?

928
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,280
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

929
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,680
What's in here?

930
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,480
Oh, this is...

931
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,640
Whoa.

932
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,220
Okay.

933
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:17,980
Uh...

934
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,620
O1.

935
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:18,920
Okay.

936
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,740
Blocked.

937
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,500
Damn, Nancy!

938
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,200
You can't just go into people's rooms!

939
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,600
Yeah, I hope so.

940
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,360
Blocked.

941
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,360
Damn, Nancy!

942
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,700
I need a key to open this door.

943
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,180
Yeah, it's not yours!

944
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,460
Locked.

945
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,700
We could go into the men's side of the...

946
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:38,980
Whoa!

947
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,700
Hang on!

948
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,000
Men only right now.

949
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
What do you mean?

950
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,380
The baths!

951
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,080
The blue banner means the baths are for men.

952
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,700
The red banner means women only.

953
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,940
This guy looks like an otaku.

954
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,840
I don't know why we don't mention this at the front desk.

955
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,140
This is useful information.

956
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,820
I agree.

957
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,800
Anyway, I'm Rentaro.

958
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,120
Oh!

959
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,240
I'm out in the garden if you need anything.

960
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,140
Thanks, Rentaro!

961
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,280
Oh!

962
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:01,760
Oh!

963
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:03,960
Ow!

964
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,840
That hurt.

965
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,330
Hideo Kojima!

966
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,050
I'll have to wait until the banner changes color.

967
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,330
Damn.

968
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,910
Nancy, that never stopped you before.

969
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,350
Come on.

970
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,010
Locked.

971
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,550
Come on, girl.

972
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,050
Seriously?

973
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,570
Locked.

974
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,610
Hmm.

975
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,310
Ooh!

976
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,670
Garden!

977
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,250
Oh, I hear like the little deer scare.

978
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,410
Um...

979
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,090
Oh, wait.

980
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,410
No, no.

981
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:34,710
Back?

982
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,750
Wow, this is like so detailed, no?

983
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,950
Where's our room?

984
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:40,750
19...

985
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,310
Oh, we're close!

986
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:42,970
Uh-oh.

987
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:43,450
Wait.

988
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,450
We're not close.

989
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:44,990
Locked.

990
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,590
We're going the wrong way.

991
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,010
Oh, she said on the second floor.

992
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:48,230
No.

993
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,630
Hahaha!

994
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:50,570
Oh!

995
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,770
We went in a big ol' circle!

996
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,160
It's gonna take me a second, guys, to get rid- Where's the stairs, though?

997
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,800
What's this?

998
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,180
Famous Kyoto Gardens.

999
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,220
A visitor's guide.

1000
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,740
Whoa!

1001
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,620
Oh!

1002
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:08,980
Um...

1003
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,180
It's a lot of reading.

1004
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,020
Thanks.

1005
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,800
What is this music?

1006
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,620
What is this music?

1007
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,440
Hi.

1008
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,940
I met Rentaro.

1009
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,460
Who is he?

1010
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,780
I met Rentaro.

1011
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,960
Who is he?

1012
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,420
Oh, Rentaro.

1013
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,700
He's my boyfriend.

1014
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,860
He's also a handyman around here.

1015
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,440
Boyfriend?

1016
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,760
Have you two been dating long?

1017
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm sorry.

1018
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,920
I should really get back to my paperwork.

1019
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,700
But if you have any questions about the ryokan, please don't hesitate to ask.

1020
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,500
How long have you been dating?

1021
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,660
Nancy, don't ask questions.

1022
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:41,900
Oh shit.

1023
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,920
I'll talk to you later.

1024
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,900
See you later.

1025
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,660
Nancy, stop being so nosy!

1026
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,360
Oh, here we go.

1027
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,660
Locked.

1028
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,120
Damn.

1029
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,500
I need a key to open this door.

1030
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,060
Nancy, we'll get in one of these.

1031
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
I need a key to open this door.

1032
00:39:59,360 --> 00:39:59,580
Wait.

1033
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,140
Locked.

1034
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:00,940
They're going up.

1035
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,640
Oh, shoot.

1036
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,000
Locked.

1037
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,160
Locked.

1038
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,820
Locked.

1039
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,460
Okay, I think it's on the other side.

1040
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,800
So we go down here.

1041
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,580
And we go through here.

1042
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,860
And we go up here.

1043
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,800
Locked.

1044
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:18,880
22.

1045
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,480
We're 24.

1046
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,160
Maybe this one.

1047
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,380
Yippee!

1048
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Locked.

1049
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,100
Oh.

1050
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,800
Alright.

1051
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,240
What else do we have in here?

1052
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,560
Oh, this is the case file.

1053
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:33,860
Okay.

1054
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,120
Are we gonna be able to play pachinko?

1055
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,540
I wonder.

1056
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,440
That'd be awesome.

1057
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,900
What the hell is this?

1058
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,300
No, what is that?

1059
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,040
Okay.

1060
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,340
Um.

1061
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,880
Ooh, what's this?

1062
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,340
Wow!

1063
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,340
Small room.

1064
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,620
I don't think...

1065
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,500
The Japan Teacher Exchange.

1066
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,580
No, wait, wait.

1067
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,240
I...

1068
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,500
I do...

1069
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,700
I...

1070
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,700
She said that she was going to be...

1071
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,160
Like, teaching English.

1072
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,220
But...

1073
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,620
I thought it was like a...

1074
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1075
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,780
Someone's just...

1076
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,600
Hiring me.

1077
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,900
This is actually like jet.

1078
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,340
Oh, wait.

1079
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,180
No, it's TE.

1080
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,600
TE Japan.

1081
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,240
I never thought spending a summer abroad would be so rewarding.

1082
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:19,740
TE.

1083
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,840
Japan was the best experience I could have asked for.

1084
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,500
Duration.

1085
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,060
Two weeks.

1086
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,800
Three to four weeks.

1087
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,800
Five to eight weeks.

1088
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,140
Dear teacher.

1089
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,840
Thank you for teaching us English.

1090
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,180
You were the best teacher ever.

1091
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,020
We'll miss you.

1092
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,740
Your students from class...

1093
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,440
Nine.

1094
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,720
Nine.

1095
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,520
News.

1096
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,260
Nine.

1097
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,460
TE Japan changed my life.

1098
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,640
By the end of the program, I'd learned so much more than I'd ever dreamed.

1099
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,560
Jamie.

1100
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,480
Experience the excitement of living abroad and make a difference as a teacher's aide in Japan.

1101
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,200
You'll team with a certain...

1102
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,760
Oh, sorry.

1103
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,540
Certified instructor to teach English to grade school children during the day.

1104
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,480
Leaving your evenings free to explore and discover Japan.

1105
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,640
I heard Nancy is retiring from solving crimes to become an artist.

1106
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,800
What?

1107
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,540
No, she couldn't.

1108
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:16,080
Programs are available to visiting students during the summer months with 20 hours in the classroom per week.

1109
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:23,060
Responsibilities include preparing lessons, grading, writing assignments, and helping the children practice their conversational skills.

1110
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,520
Make a difference.

1111
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,760
And new friends.

1112
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,140
That will last a lifetime.

1113
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,660
Black.

1114
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,620
Kuro.

1115
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,380
Cat.

1116
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,140
Neko.

1117
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,560
Red.

1118
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,520
Aka.

1119
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,160
You don't know how to...

1120
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,440
You don't even know how to say those.

1121
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,100
Nancy Drew.

1122
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,760
You need a dictionary for the signs.

1123
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,900
Our students.

1124
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,340
Whoa!

1125
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,440
We have Kenta.

1126
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,100
Who likes dinosaurs?

1127
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,880
Robots?

1128
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,020
Playing tag with brothers and friends.

1129
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,600
He's extremely...

1130
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,160
Why are we getting all this stuff about our students?

1131
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,460
He's a bit difficult to get focused.

1132
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,620
Very helpful.

1133
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,120
Can be given additional classroom chores and...

1134
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,880
We're putting Kenta to work.

1135
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,500
Fumiko.

1136
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,640
Reading cats.

1137
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,940
Cooking with her mom.

1138
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,420
Very bright and self-reliant.

1139
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,740
Would consider advancing her to next grade level, but socially is very reserved and somewhat delayed.

1140
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,620
These are too...

1141
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,560
These are too realistic, I'd say.

1142
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,500
Oh my god.

1143
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,160
Kenta rocks.

1144
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,440
Yeah, we love Kenta.

1145
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,200
He's so cool.

1146
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,590
I mean...

1147
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,790
She likes riding her bike.

1148
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,330
Playing with her sister and friends.

1149
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,310
Dolls and puzzles.

1150
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,690
Deliberately split her and her twin sister into different classes.

1151
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,710
As they were relying too much on each other.

1152
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,190
With Kana taking charge and making decisions.

1153
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,630
Aimi is starting to stand on her own, but may need additional encouragement.

1154
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,990
Some difficulties with grammar.

1155
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,930
Yeah, these are the suspects of the crime.

1156
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,110
Sakura enjoys playing by the seaside cliffs.

1157
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,450
Get the seven-year-old away from the cliffs.

1158
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,830
Very interested in wells.

1159
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,550
Are she okay?

1160
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:33,990
Sakura is very quiet and prone to making cryptic statements that other children find disturbing.

1161
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,530
There's something wrong about that Sakura chick.

1162
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,750
She's not right.

1163
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,350
Is she okay?

1164
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,770
A self-directed learner.

1165
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,190
She knows more about historic Japan than most.

1166
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:54,670
Although she does seem overly fixated on some of the more morbid chapters of history.

1167
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,690
Often needs to be redirected towards appropriate class discussion.

1168
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,710
She kind of sounds like me when I was a kid.

1169
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,970
Where I was just like morbidly...

1170
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,090
Or I was obsessed with like the morbid things of...

1171
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,410
Some kids are just like that.

1172
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,050
I, you know...

1173
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,630
I came out fine.

1174
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:19,390
Takeo.

1175
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,450
Likes marine animals visiting seashore with family.

1176
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,830
One year busted!

1177
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,830
Thank you!

1178
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,230
Yeah, that kid ain't right.

1179
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:30,770
Very distractible.

1180
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:31,930
Seemingly intelli...

1181
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:32,730
Seeming...

1182
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,630
Seemingly intelligent.

1183
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,470
He's seven!

1184
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,560
Seven!

1185
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,320
Loses everything and has yet to turn in an assignment on time.

1186
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,720
Does excellent work when and if he remembers to hand it in.

1187
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,780
Tends to get lost easily and is often late to class.

1188
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,760
Those are our students!

1189
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,500
Darja!

1190
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,820
Thank you so much for your ear!

1191
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,260
Thank you!

1192
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,340
Am I...

1193
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,240
Am I...

1194
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,620
Delayed?

1195
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,300
Sorry.

1196
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,840
I put on ultra low latency, but I feel like...

1197
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,720
I feel like it's a little delayed.

1198
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,560
That's okay.

1199
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,500
What's your name?

1200
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,500
Alright, let's grade some homework.

1201
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,180
What?

1202
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,420
We have...

1203
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,380
Sakura.

1204
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,400
Sakura.

1205
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,300
I is Sakura.

1206
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,180
No.

1207
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,280
Bad.

1208
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,780
Wait.

1209
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,220
Sakura.

1210
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, this is her.

1211
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,320
We is Japanese.

1212
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,060
No.

1213
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:37,660
Um...

1214
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,100
You know what?

1215
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,100
I has black hair.

1216
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,400
Already did that one.

1217
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,100
Oh, my bad.

1218
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:44,340
Okay.

1219
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,780
Next.

1220
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:45,900
Aimi.

1221
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,940
My name is Aimi.

1222
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:47,980
I are Japan.

1223
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,640
I is seven.

1224
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,400
My eyes is brown.

1225
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,320
Oh, whoops.

1226
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,340
The first one was good.

1227
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,860
I already snapped that one.

1228
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,400
Fumiko.

1229
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,220
I am Fumiko.

1230
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:03,900
I am Japanese.

1231
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,720
I am seven.

1232
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,440
I have black hair.

1233
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:05,760
Damn.

1234
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,900
Fumiko is a genius.

1235
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,060
Wow.

1236
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,240
My name is...

1237
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,520
Whoa.

1238
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,980
He's using apostrophes.

1239
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,520
Mine's Japanese.

1240
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,020
Seven I am.

1241
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,480
Eyes be brown.

1242
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,900
Oh, no.

1243
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,700
Kenta is so awesome.

1244
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,960
Yeah, Kenta.

1245
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,060
Kenta's great.

1246
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,760
Takeo.

1247
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,420
I name is Takeo.

1248
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,480
I is ten.

1249
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,460
I is Japanese.

1250
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,180
I have blue hair.

1251
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,820
Cool.

1252
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,140
Um, I think there's a ghost behind us.

1253
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,900
Sorry, Takeo.

1254
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,420
Okay.

1255
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,380
We graded.

1256
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,800
What's this?

1257
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,400
Ryokan Hie?

1258
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,160
If I have something to send, this might come in handy.

1259
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,200
Neat.

1260
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,720
Welcome to Ryokan Hie.

1261
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,160
Oh, no.

1262
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,280
Not the papyrus one.

1263
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,080
Where you will experience traditional Japanese culture and hospitality at its finest.

1264
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:22,060
Located near the base of majestic Mount Hie, our Ryokan has been offering a relaxing stay to guests since the 1700s.

1265
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,100
Hi, ghost.

1266
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,620
Hello.

1267
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,940
Ease away.

1268
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,580
The day travels with a calming soak in the hot springs bath.

1269
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,160
The entrance is located on the first floor hallway across from room number seven, with open times changing daily for men and women.

1270
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,360
Showers for pre-washing and towels are available in the baths.

1271
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,280
Hi.

1272
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,940
Oh my gosh.

1273
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,980
I was just thinking the other day how I wanted to go.

1274
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,740
I've only stayed at Ryokan once.

1275
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:49,440
There was a drama called Good Morning Call.

1276
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,860
And I really liked it.

1277
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,980
And I was watching it while I was in Japan.

1278
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,680
And so there's one episode where they go to Ikaho Onsen, which is in Gunma.

1279
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,260
Which is like a little north of Tokyo.

1280
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,700
And so I went to Ikaho Onsen for just like a day.

1281
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,500
I went for like a... it was like a weekend trip.

1282
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:19,380
And I took... I did like Oshikatsu at the places that they filmed at.

1283
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,580
Yeah.

1284
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,670
I've actually never been to Kyoto.

1285
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,610
But right now I don't really want to go because...

1286
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:39,030
Right now all I hear about it is that it's so overly crowded with tourists.

1287
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:40,550
So...

1288
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,350
I don't know.

1289
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,610
I don't know if like...

1290
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,370
One, I don't want to contribute to that.

1291
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,410
And two...

1292
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,250
I...

1293
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,130
Don't want to go with a lot of people.

1294
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:55,890
Yeah, they're not really happy with foreigners right now.

1295
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:58,390
Yeah...

1296
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,610
I think it's just like the...

1297
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:02,990
Over...

1298
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:03,630
Over...

1299
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,710
Crowding...

1300
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,430
Of stuff.

1301
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,890
Like...

1302
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,710
People who are living in Kyoto are having trouble...

1303
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,270
Being able to get to places they need to.

1304
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,530
Because like trains and everything is so crowded.

1305
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,410
Hmm...

1306
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,930
I went during February and it wasn't bad.

1307
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,110
I think it's only a recent thing that happened, no?

1308
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:22,850
But like...

1309
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:23,990
Maybe not.

1310
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:24,730
Because there was...

1311
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,450
What, like last year they were saying they were like...

1312
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,650
Closing off certain streets to for...

1313
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,070
To...

1314
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,070
To foreigners.

1315
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,290
Because they were like chasing after the...

1316
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,190
The...

1317
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:34,630
The...

1318
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,950
The Maiko and everything.

1319
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:38,770
Uh...

1320
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:39,950
So...

1321
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,550
Uh...

1322
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,530
But you know...

1323
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,210
If you go, just be respectful.

1324
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,210
Mm-hmm.

1325
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,510
I mean that's...

1326
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,770
That should be all the time though.

1327
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,430
For guests wishing...

1328
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:52,070
To...

1329
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:52,890
Visit more of Kyoto.

1330
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:53,990
The local...

1331
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,210
Misawa station offers...

1332
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,210
Real access to downtown.

1333
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,390
Popular tourist sites always include the...

1334
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,590
Pachinko Parlor!

1335
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,190
Hey!

1336
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,250
Why don't you gamble while you're at Kyoto?

1337
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,910
So happy you're streaming a Nancy-Ju game!

1338
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,290
Thank you, counselor!

1339
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:09,670
Thank you.

1340
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:12,990
Um...

1341
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,010
At the Kurei...

1342
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:14,710
At...

1343
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,850
Or...

1344
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:14,970
Sorry.

1345
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:15,810
At Kurei?

1346
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,770
Or the Exposition Center.

1347
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,550
Currently hosting the Technology of Tomorrow Ex...

1348
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,670
Expo at...

1349
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:23,070
Uh...

1350
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:23,630
Matsuei.

1351
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,390
It is...

1352
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,090
Suggested that guests pre-purchase their FASCA...

1353
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,930
FASCA train tickets before...

1354
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,250
Arriving at the Ryokan.

1355
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,450
Our front desk is open from...

1356
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,910
7am, 1am daily...

1357
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,310
To help with any additional needs.

1358
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,030
Thank you for choosing Ryokan Hiei.

1359
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:38,870
Welcome home!

1360
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,570
Alright, let's go to Pachinko, baby.

1361
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,010
What else is in our room?

1362
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:47,390
Um...

1363
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,930
Oh!

1364
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:49,030
That's our stuff!

1365
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,210
We got our phrase book!

1366
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:52,710
What's...

1367
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,990
Wait, I need to know...

1368
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,050
Can I use it?

1369
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:56,950
Maybe not.

1370
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:57,210
Okay.

1371
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,130
We've got...

1372
00:51:59,130 --> 00:51:59,410
We've got...

1373
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,130
All the candies and stuff that we...

1374
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,250
Oh!

1375
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,250
There's our FASCA!

1376
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,210
Our train pass...

1377
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,750
I guess that's everything.

1378
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:08,950
Very nice.

1379
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,430
Anything in here?

1380
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,330
Nope.

1381
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,250
I like that we just brought candy.

1382
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,890
There's no food in Japan.

1383
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,370
Okay...

1384
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:19,650
Our...

1385
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,650
One...

1386
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,490
A star!

1387
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,430
Interesting.

1388
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,070
Let's check out our view.

1389
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,190
Just kidding.

1390
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,010
Nevermind.

1391
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:37,510
Wasn't there a table?

1392
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,090
Oh, here.

1393
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,090
Um...

1394
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:42,410
Okay.

1395
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,690
I guess we did everything in the room.

1396
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:45,030
No?

1397
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,410
Seems like it.

1398
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:56,050
Mmm...

1399
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,450
She can't get the cow snacks.

1400
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,970
True!

1401
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,070
The music is so spooky.

1402
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,870
Still for men only.

1403
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:08,670
Let's go to the gardens.

1404
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,490
Do, do, do, do,

1405
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,500
do, do, do, do, do.

1406
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,120
Wow, how...

1407
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,820
I'm feeling so relaxed.

1408
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:26,860
It's so peaceful.

1409
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,040
Yup.

1410
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,720
I'm feeling so relaxed right now.

1411
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,440
Yup.

1412
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,140
Oh, God.

1413
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,300
So scary.

1414
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,780
I'm feeling so relaxed!

1415
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,460
Oh, hello!

1416
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,280
Hi again.

1417
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,560
I'm Rentaro.

1418
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,700
It's nice to meet you officially.

1419
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,580
So, um...

1420
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,880
You're still here.

1421
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
That's surprising.

1422
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,620
I'm Nancy.

1423
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,920
What do you mean, surprising?

1424
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,700
Did I say that?

1425
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,200
Whoops!

1426
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,540
So, you're American.

1427
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,060
From New York City?

1428
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,760
No, a place called River Heights.

1429
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,820
It's in...

1430
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,280
Oh, okay.

1431
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,040
Oh, he doesn't care.

1432
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,400
That's one of the places I always wanted to go.

1433
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,440
I mean, you'd have to be crazy to live there.

1434
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,860
But on the other hand, you'd have to be crazy not to live there.

1435
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,840
It's one of those, um...

1436
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,440
This accent.

1437
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:22,980
Unwinnables.

1438
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,540
Do you work here?

1439
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,440
Technically.

1440
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,320
It's a complicated thing we've got going on.

1441
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,700
I'm sort of like the handyman around here.

1442
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,160
Okay.

1443
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,580
So, should I bother getting to know you, or are you going to be like all of the rest?

1444
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,080
What do all of the rest do?

1445
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,840
He's so cryptic.

1446
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,260
Get spooked in the middle of the night, pack their bags and never come back.

1447
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,580
Even the ones who come to see the ghosts.

1448
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,880
I shouldn't be telling you this.

1449
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,940
Oh, well, already did.

1450
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,740
If you see Takaido, this conversation never happened.

1451
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,300
Ghosts?

1452
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,560
What ghosts?

1453
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,960
We got one of those, um, haunted hotspot guides.

1454
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:08,120
So we get a lot of ghost hunters here.

1455
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,860
And that's always a treat, because they're totally not obnoxious.

1456
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,820
So, people think this place is haunted?

1457
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,500
Uh-huh.

1458
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,980
Well, some people think this place is haunted.

1459
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,220
Kind of like some people think the moon landing was faked.

1460
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,360
And some people like adult contemporary.

1461
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,740
Don't be one of those people.

1462
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,460
He's so judgy.

1463
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,380
You like puzzles?

1464
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,960
I guess you could say that.

1465
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,200
I figured...

1466
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,580
Wait.

1467
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,840
You're going to love this.

1468
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,280
A nonogram?

1469
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,080
It's called a nonogram.

1470
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,040
Wait, that's my thing.

1471
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,420
What's that?

1472
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,600
It's just another example of how awesome numbers are.

1473
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,420
I do those every day.

1474
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,680
The letters are cool and all.

1475
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,980
He looks like young Hideo Koji.

1476
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,800
I mean, get with the game letters.

1477
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:47,680
He really does.

1478
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,720
Numbers on the other hand.

1479
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,040
Uh-huh.

1480
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,640
Get a few handfuls of those.

1481
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,980
And you can make a bridge.

1482
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,500
Or send a person into space.

1483
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,760
Or express the makeup of our genetic code.

1484
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,600
Or...

1485
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,880
They can make a neat picture.

1486
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,460
Okay.

1487
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,900
Take a look in here.

1488
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,860
All you need to do...

1489
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,540
I love nonograms.

1490
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,940
...is look this over and finish the pattern.

1491
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,140
And when you're done, picture!

1492
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,660
Here, take this.

1493
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,740
Give it a shot.

1494
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,180
Bring it back when you're done, and I'll give you something better.

1495
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:17,780
Ooh.

1496
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,360
Sure.

1497
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,060
And there are instructions inside in case you get stuck.

1498
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:23,640
Okay.

1499
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,940
Hold on.

1500
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:25,340
I'll stop.

1501
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:25,980
Uh, wait.

1502
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,620
Actually, let's...

1503
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,340
Miwako seems to really like Suki.

1504
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,420
I know.

1505
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,100
Which is great.

1506
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,680
She's Suki Suki.

1507
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,540
Because that girl is hard to buy for.

1508
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,380
And it's been sort of like...

1509
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:34,940
I thought he said he's...

1510
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,560
She's hot.

1511
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,580
Either she's getting crazy sensitive, or I'm becoming a huge jerk.

1512
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:40,300
Hmm.

1513
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:40,980
Give it a shot.

1514
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,620
Oh, I will.

1515
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,380
It's definitely one or both of those things.

1516
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,400
Okay.

1517
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,380
Um, what are you...

1518
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,640
What are you building there, mister?

1519
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,000
What are you building there?

1520
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,860
Oh.

1521
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,460
This is the Rentaro 4000.

1522
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,360
I sort of got inspired by Suki.

1523
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,000
What's it going to be?

1524
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,880
A robotic dog.

1525
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:01,520
Oh.

1526
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,740
Or maybe just a robotic dog's leg.

1527
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,200
Leg?

1528
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,120
I'll be honest, I had no idea how wrong these things take to build.

1529
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,120
But then again, a dog's leg is not a good gift without the rest of the dog.

1530
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,200
So the borders aren't creepy, come to think of it.

1531
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:16,640
Yeah.

1532
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,680
Is it going to be a gift for Miwako?

1533
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,960
Oh, definitely.

1534
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,680
She's my robotic muse.

1535
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,120
But she's not robotic.

1536
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,580
Not that you'd think she is.

1537
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,000
And this is why I work with machines.

1538
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,800
They're totally oblivious to awkwardness.

1539
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,620
This poor guy.

1540
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,020
Maybe Kenta can help.

1541
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,660
This guy.

1542
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,120
Are you okay?

1543
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,580
Are you okay, Rentaro?

1544
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,140
I'll let you get back to work.

1545
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:45,860
Bye.

1546
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,780
Bye.

1547
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,620
What?

1548
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,400
I don't even know what she's talking about.

1549
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,960
What is he working on?

1550
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,580
Okay, hold on.

1551
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,480
The puzzle book.

1552
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,580
Nonograms!

1553
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,380
I love...

1554
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,320
I don't need the instructions.

1555
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,220
Okay.

1556
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,500
Uh...

1557
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,620
Oops.

1558
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,560
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

1559
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,340
Wait, it's...

1560
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,960
It's 5x5.

1561
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,240
So...

1562
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,740
Uh...

1563
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:15,620
Uh...

1564
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:15,840
Wait.

1565
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,600
Oh, it's 10.

1566
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,840
Oh, I'm thinking of 15.

1567
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,140
Uh...

1568
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,660
But we can...

1569
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1570
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,880
But we can do this.

1571
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,500
We can do that.

1572
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,980
We can do this.

1573
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,420
Uh...

1574
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,040
Uh...

1575
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,440
That...

1576
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:29,560
That...

1577
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,420
Uh...

1578
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,240
I wish you could mark out the ones that you don't use.

1579
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:34,460
No?

1580
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,080
Um...

1581
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,500
Usually, with these, like, you can...

1582
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,800
You can, like, cross out, you know?

1583
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah!

1584
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,540
Picross is a nonogram.

1585
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:48,440
Mm-hmm.

1586
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:48,820
Mm-hmm.

1587
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,180
Mm-hmm.

1588
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:51,640
So...

1589
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,640
Yeah.

1590
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,140
So that's that.

1591
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,440
Oh, and that's that.

1592
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,620
And this...

1593
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,160
So that.

1594
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,480
And then this.

1595
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,420
And...

1596
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,280
That.

1597
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,820
So this, and this.

1598
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,080
One, two, three, four, six, seven...

1599
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,340
Uh...

1600
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:12,920
Uh...

1601
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,900
It's hard when you can't cross out!

1602
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,220
No!

1603
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,660
So that's two.

1604
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,860
And then four...

1605
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,620
Is it a heart?

1606
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,260
Maybe?

1607
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,480
Probably.

1608
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,640
Probably.

1609
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:25,560
It's a heart.

1610
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,140
Probably?

1611
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,660
Like, it's probably this.

1612
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,060
If I had to guess.

1613
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,780
It's probably just this.

1614
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,600
If I had to guess.

1615
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,140
For the dog's nose.

1616
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,000
Oh, maybe!

1617
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,220
Is there more?

1618
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,960
Did I complete it?

1619
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,980
How do I know?

1620
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,720
Maybe I didn't do it right.

1621
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,260
Oh, wait!

1622
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,780
Oh, I just realized the four down here.

1623
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,500
I did it!

1624
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,180
Oh, there we go.

1625
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,560
That's why.

1626
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,560
Is there more?

1627
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:06,720
Nancy?

1628
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:07,920
Oop.

1629
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,200
Give me more puzzle!

1630
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:12,660
No!

1631
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:17,630
I missed...

1632
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,910
Guys, I'm sorry.

1633
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,630
I don't know why, but it seems like my chat is a little delayed.

1634
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:25,810
Upper right?

1635
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,790
No, it doesn't do anything.

1636
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,410
Oh my god, the music is insane!

1637
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,170
What about...

1638
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:35,590
Renogram?

1639
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,930
Oh, never mind.

1640
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,290
I've finished your puzzle!

1641
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:40,170
Hello?

1642
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,190
I've finished the Nanograms puzzle.

1643
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:44,250
Awesome!

1644
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,510
Nice job!

1645
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,110
What do you think?

1646
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:48,370
I...

1647
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:49,650
What if I say...

1648
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,390
I've got something better.

1649
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:54,890
You know it.

1650
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,090
You love it.

1651
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,170
The original!

1652
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,330
Sudoku!

1653
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,070
It's so crazy.

1654
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,330
Oh, I've played that before.

1655
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,590
Oh, I've played that before.

1656
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:04,430
Great!

1657
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:05,150
Great!

1658
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:05,490
Eh!

1659
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,410
I've got some good ones for you here.

1660
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:08,530
Here you go.

1661
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,550
Bring it back if you want more.

1662
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:11,390
Thanks!

1663
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,510
I'm back for more Nanograms!

1664
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,470
I'm back for more Nanograms!

1665
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:16,350
Nano!

1666
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:16,990
Here you go!

1667
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:17,610
Thank you!

1668
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,610
I'll stop bugging you now.

1669
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,950
Catch you around!

1670
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:22,550
Bye!

1671
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,130
Okay, let's do more Nanograms.

1672
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:28,930
Ah!

1673
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:29,370
Yeah!

1674
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:31,950
Okay...

1675
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:32,170
Oop!

1676
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:33,170
3...

1677
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,150
1, 1, 1, 2, 3...

1678
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,150
3...

1679
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,790
2...

1680
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,450
2...

1681
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:38,590
So this one's solved.

1682
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:39,510
This one's solved.

1683
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,690
He is really ganky.

1684
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:46,570
6...

1685
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:50,330
Oh gosh, I hate not being able to...

1686
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:52,490
6...

1687
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,570
So...

1688
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:55,810
I hate not being able to cross him out.

1689
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,490
It's...

1690
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,190
It's on hard mode right now.

1691
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,750
Um...

1692
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,330
3...

1693
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:03,370
3...

1694
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:05,590
2...

1695
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,300
I've never played this before.

1696
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,420
Is it p-cross?

1697
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:14,940
Yeah!

1698
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,560
And p-crosses are just...

1699
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,260
Or p-cross is just a nonogram.

1700
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,000
So...

1701
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,180
Basically, yeah.

1702
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,500
It shows how to put an X, it does.

1703
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,180
Am I stupid?

1704
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,120
You can mark out known blanks with an X.

1705
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:31,400
How?

1706
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,660
How do I do that?

1707
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,540
How?

1708
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,180
Wait, in the column with 2, 1...

1709
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:41,760
Oh?

1710
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,820
It doesn't tell me how!

1711
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:45,800
But...

1712
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,680
What do I click?

1713
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,560
With my brain?

1714
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,440
Click the square again?

1715
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,180
Right click?

1716
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,460
It was a right click this whole time!

1717
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:00,760
Wow.

1718
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,560
No more hard mode.

1719
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,300
Thank goodness.

1720
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,240
Oh wait, I think I was right earlier.

1721
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,340
I'm silly.

1722
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:10,220
Okay.

1723
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,320
2...

1724
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,120
1...

1725
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,640
3...

1726
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,940
See, just like that.

1727
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,620
And then this...

1728
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,680
And then this...

1729
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,560
And so...

1730
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:20,900
Oh, okay.

1731
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,820
I should probably explain how the game works.

1732
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:23,420
So...

1733
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:25,980
You have...

1734
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,140
Your...

1735
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:27,900
Your...

1736
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,200
Your columns...

1737
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,280
And your rows.

1738
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,580
This will say...

1739
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,560
What is filled in.

1740
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,440
So, we have...

1741
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,440
We have a...

1742
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,660
5 by 5.

1743
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,420
So...

1744
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,020
Or...

1745
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,100
Wait...

1746
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,220
Is it 5 by 5?

1747
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,320
Anyway, there's 10 slots.

1748
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,600
So, this says 10.

1749
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,540
You fill them all in.

1750
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,840
And then...

1751
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,580
With this...

1752
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,440
It's 3, 1, 1.

1753
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,440
But...

1754
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,200
They can't touch.

1755
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,600
So, it's 1, 1...

1756
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,780
And then 1, 2, 3...

1757
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:55,900
Oh!

1758
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,020
It's gonna be like that.

1759
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,720
And then either these two will make up the 3, or these two.

1760
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,040
10 by 10.

1761
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:02,100
Yes.

1762
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,200
Yeah.

1763
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:04,520
Yeah.

1764
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:04,860
Oh, yeah.

1765
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,180
Cause this is 5.

1766
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,140
Sorry, my brain is low today.

1767
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,740
But see here?

1768
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,100
It's 1, 1, 1, 1.

1769
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:11,760
So, it'll be 1.

1770
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,140
We have 1 here, and 1 here.

1771
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:13,860
And then...

1772
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:14,980
These...

1773
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,380
One of these will be 1.

1774
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,400
And another 1.

1775
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,500
So, we have 4.

1776
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,780
It can't be this one.

1777
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,060
Because this is...

1778
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:24,780
It's just the...

1779
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,720
The 1.

1780
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,740
So, we do that.

1781
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,000
So, that's 5.

1782
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,620
And then 1 here.

1783
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,320
So, it's that.

1784
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:32,460
Yeah.

1785
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,460
I do these literally daily, you guys.

1786
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,460
Like, I am always...

1787
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,700
And then...

1788
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,240
Oh, okay.

1789
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:40,520
Nevermind.

1790
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,140
We got the 2.

1791
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,100
Um...

1792
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,140
1, 2, 3...

1793
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,060
1...

1794
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,140
Let's see.

1795
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:48,620
Mmm...

1796
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:49,940
I'm slow today, though.

1797
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:53,400
Uh...

1798
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,180
So, this would be 1.

1799
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:54,880
And then 2.

1800
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:55,500
And then 1.

1801
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,080
Like that.

1802
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,780
And then this is 1.

1803
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,180
So...

1804
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,640
This is also 1.

1805
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,240
Wait.

1806
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,240
1, 2, 3...

1807
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,300
1...

1808
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,080
2, 3...

1809
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,000
Oh, so like this.

1810
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:06,620
Like that.

1811
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,900
So, it can't be that.

1812
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,340
Mmm...

1813
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:11,960
Uh...

1814
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,300
They're...

1815
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,240
They're so fun, though.

1816
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:13,900
So...

1817
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,360
See, like, this is 1, 1, 1.

1818
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,840
The reason it's this is because you can't have 3 1's here.

1819
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,480
Because there always has to be a space.

1820
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,420
In between them.

1821
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,020
So, that's why we know that one is 1.

1822
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,380
And that clears that row.

1823
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,040
And then this clears that row.

1824
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,260
Opening Meow Tower right now!

1825
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,740
Oh, I love Meow Tower!

1826
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:32,960
I play Meow...

1827
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,940
That's what I play every day, is Meow Tower.

1828
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:35,660
Hahaha.

1829
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:36,880
So dissonate.

1830
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:37,640
Does not...

1831
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,760
Does not dissonate.

1832
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:41,480
Uh...

1833
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,420
And so...

1834
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,620
Let's see.

1835
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,260
Um...

1836
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,440
So this is gonna be 3.

1837
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,720
Like that.

1838
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,440
So then we know that.

1839
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,060
And then we know that.

1840
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:51,620
And then we know that.

1841
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:51,680
And then we know that.

1842
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,040
See?

1843
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,380
It's all just...

1844
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,780
And that clears that row.

1845
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,760
It's just all about...

1846
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,000
You get it...

1847
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,380
Just one step at a time.

1848
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,180
So we have the 1, 1.

1849
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:02,920
So we know that.

1850
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,120
So that clears that row.

1851
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:04,940
And that clears that row.

1852
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:05,960
There in this.

1853
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,480
1, 2, 3.

1854
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,320
That clears that...

1855
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:08,440
Oops.

1856
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,780
That clears that row.

1857
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:11,220
This.

1858
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:12,760
This.

1859
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:12,960
This.

1860
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,100
Another one down.

1861
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:14,560
Easy.

1862
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,240
What is that?

1863
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,060
A snail?

1864
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,160
What is it?

1865
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,660
What is it?

1866
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,100
A snail?

1867
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,640
A crashing wave?

1868
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,380
Oh, maybe.

1869
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,300
I don't know how to play Sudoku, though.

1870
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,060
I mean, I know.

1871
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,320
I know, but I don't know.

1872
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,880
See, like, that can't be two.

1873
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,880
Two, so it would be...

1874
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,840
It can't be four.

1875
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,780
Six, maybe?

1876
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,440
Can't be six.

1877
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,760
Is it nine?

1878
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,880
I don't understand Sudoku, though.

1879
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,820
Oh, I don't see who raided me, but thank you.

1880
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:13,800
Thank you, thank you.

1881
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,980
I'm just slower at Sudoku.

1882
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,900
Because I don't ever play Sudoku.

1883
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,960
But I know how to play.

1884
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,540
But I just don't know.

1885
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,980
Right box bid is won.

1886
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,220
Thanks, Nicholas.

1887
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,180
Oh, Nyaru!

1888
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,360
Thank you for the raid.

1889
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,280
We're playing Nancy Drew, but right now I'm distracted by the nonograms.

1890
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,600
I'm back for more nonograms.

1891
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,510
I'm back for more nonograms.

1892
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:44,320
I'm back for more nonograms.

1893
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,020
Here you go.

1894
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:45,800
Thanks!

1895
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,720
I'll stop bugging you now.

1896
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,880
Got you around.

1897
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,660
And, Rebac, thank you so much for the gift in.

1898
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,520
Thank you, guys.

1899
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,280
More nonograms.

1900
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,080
I love nonograms.

1901
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:01,620
Oh!

1902
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,580
I love 15 by 15, though.

1903
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:05,320
They're my favorite.

1904
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,440
So, it'll be like this.

1905
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:09,720
15...

1906
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,260
Oh, whoa.

1907
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:11,660
My bad, sorry.

1908
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,720
I got too excited.

1909
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:13,980
I'm too excitable.

1910
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,340
I'm way too excitable.

1911
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,280
Oh, thank goodness.

1912
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:19,220
Okay.

1913
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:20,460
Uh.

1914
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,320
Yeah.

1915
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:23,860
Okay.

1916
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,240
Hmm.

1917
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:26,680
Uh.

1918
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,540
I'm just getting all the obvious things out of the way real quick.

1919
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:30,900
13.

1920
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:32,940
With this.

1921
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,540
Oh, so we have that.

1922
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:35,920
Nice.

1923
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,260
There.

1924
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:37,980
There.

1925
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,040
Wait.

1926
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:39,680
1, 2, 3.

1927
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:40,480
4, 5, 6.

1928
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,060
7, 8, 9.

1929
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:41,920
10, 11, 12.

1930
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,160
Yep.

1931
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:42,900
Okay.

1932
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:43,800
8.

1933
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,220
And then there's 4.

1934
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,200
Oh.

1935
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:48,820
Whoops.

1936
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:49,340
Uh.

1937
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,440
So that's 1.

1938
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:52,560
Uh.

1939
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:55,360
Uh.

1940
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:56,780
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

1941
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,840
4, 6.

1942
01:08:59,360 --> 01:08:59,960
7, 9.

1943
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:00,440
10, 11.

1944
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,440
So it's like that.

1945
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:01,760
See?

1946
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:02,380
Um.

1947
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,280
Like that.

1948
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,020
And then 4.

1949
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,600
Oh!

1950
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:16,260
Whoopsie.

1951
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,000
Heh heh heh.

1952
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:17,860
Um.

1953
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,180
4 here.

1954
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:20,240
What?

1955
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:20,600
What?

1956
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,700
um...ok.

1957
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:26,460
Like that... Like that...

1958
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:35,080
Like that and that and that and that.

1959
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,640
Oh.

1960
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1961
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,300
Like that.

1962
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,060
Okay.

1963
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:25,310
Feels like pressure.

1964
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,430
Oh yeah, I can get rid of that.

1965
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,000
That.

1966
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,500
And that.

1967
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,680
That.

1968
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,320
Yes.

1969
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,320
Like that.

1970
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:09,480
Three.

1971
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:10,460
Two.

1972
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:11,820
There.

1973
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:12,900
Oh.

1974
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:14,740
Uh.

1975
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,960
Sorry, I really like these, you guys.

1976
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,140
I really like nonograms, okay?

1977
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,020
I'm sorry, I can't stop.

1978
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,240
Once I start.

1979
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,760
That's done.

1980
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,420
That's that.

1981
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,320
Wait a second.

1982
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,340
I messed up!

1983
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,680
I messed up somewhere.

1984
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:43,660
No!

1985
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:45,800
Wait!

1986
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,900
Oh no, I messed up somewhere!

1987
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,680
Wait, where did I mess up?

1988
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,060
Where do you hear frogs?

1989
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,420
Why are you guys saying frog?

1990
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,410
Where did I mess up?

1991
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:08,170
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 9, 11, 12.

1992
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:08,630
Oh!

1993
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:10,570
There.

1994
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:12,550
That should be that.

1995
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:13,090
Like that.

1996
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:14,070
Okay, okay, okay.

1997
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:14,550
Thank you!

1998
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:15,970
There.

1999
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:17,990
There.

2000
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:19,290
There.

2001
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:20,110
There.

2002
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:21,070
1, 2, 3.

2003
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:21,670
Wait, nope.

2004
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:23,090
There.

2005
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:24,270
What about it?

2006
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:24,910
Where am I missing?

2007
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:25,670
Uh-oh.

2008
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,290
Oh, it's a frog!

2009
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,450
Where did I mess up?

2010
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,690
I think I went too fast and my brain is too slow today.

2011
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:47,070
Eww, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 3, 4, 9, 1.

2012
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:48,990
Where did I mess up?

2013
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:57,350
No puzzle stands a chance.

2014
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:58,790
I got it.

2015
01:12:58,950 --> 01:12:59,350
Yay!

2016
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:06,250
I never noticed what I'm creating until I'm done with it.

2017
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,130
I'm always just looking at the numbers.

2018
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,330
Can I do one more?

2019
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,530
Hello?

2020
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,730
I'm back for more nonograms.

2021
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,670
Here you go.

2022
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:21,450
Thank you!

2023
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:23,750
I should go.

2024
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,910
I'll talk to you later.

2025
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:26,030
Peace out.

2026
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:27,070
Peace out.

2027
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,370
Hold on, you guys froze again.

2028
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:33,350
Go for it!

2029
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,450
I love a nonogram.

2030
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,110
I love the nonogram.

2031
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2032
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:44,990
Okay.

2033
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:46,330
One more.

2034
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:46,690
Sorry.

2035
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:47,890
Then we'll continue the game.

2036
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:48,810
Just one more.

2037
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:49,510
Just one more.

2038
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:56,900
Okay.

2039
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,520
I don't think I would...

2040
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,640
This would be impossible if I couldn't cross him out though.

2041
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:13,310
I...

2042
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,500
Mm-mm.

2043
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,800
Shh.

2044
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,560
Oh, I...

2045
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:22,200
Uh...

2046
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:22,900
Uh...

2047
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,400
Uh...

2048
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:23,500
Uh...

2049
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:23,880
There we go.

2050
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,200
Can't be that.

2051
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:25,820
Can't be that.

2052
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,520
Can't be that.

2053
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:31,940
Can't be that.

2054
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,360
Let's see.

2055
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,620
Right?

2056
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:38,700
Right?

2057
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,300
Yes.

2058
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:42,920
I think.

2059
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,420
I feel pressure though.

2060
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,140
One, two, three, four.

2061
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,540
One, two.

2062
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,060
I feel pressure.

2063
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,040
Just break out a web browser or hand cam.

2064
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,280
What, for this?

2065
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,460
Oh, finally some relaxing music.

2066
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:08,700
Gosh.

2067
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,620
Never mind.

2068
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:17,760
I lied.

2069
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,500
You're very cute when you're excited about doing them.

2070
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:23,280
No!

2071
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,280
No!

2072
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,520
That should be right.

2073
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:30,720
I think.

2074
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,080
I miss Meow Tower.

2075
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,760
It's way easier.

2076
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,060
I miss Meow Tower.

2077
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:38,200
Meow Tower.

2078
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:43,040
The music is like just almost creepy.

2079
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,300
Oh god.

2080
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,280
It's getting creepier.

2081
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:47,700
Okay.

2082
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,460
Let's see.

2083
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,160
What could this be?

2084
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,180
Meow Tower.

2085
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,680
Can't be that.

2086
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:59,960
So that's that.

2087
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:00,960
That.

2088
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,240
Meow Meow Meow.

2089
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,720
One, two, three, four, five.

2090
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:10,500
Hmm.

2091
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:11,500
Oh!

2092
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,560
Sometimes my hand moves too fast.

2093
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,020
Three, four, five, six.

2094
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:16,280
Okay.

2095
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,300
We're good there.

2096
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,680
We're good, good, good there.

2097
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,560
Uh, this.

2098
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:20,400
Okay.

2099
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,620
So that is not that.

2100
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,580
Uh, that.

2101
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,040
That.

2102
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:24,100
That.

2103
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,240
And there.

2104
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:25,720
Okay.

2105
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:26,660
Alrighty.

2106
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:27,360
Two.

2107
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,140
Two.

2108
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:30,220
Two.

2109
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,700
This one's not so bad, I suppose.

2110
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,600
You got this easy, cutie.

2111
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,760
Thank you!

2112
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:38,480
Yeah.

2113
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,840
I am locked in.

2114
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,540
I am locked in.

2115
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,020
I really like a nonogram though.

2116
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,180
They're so fun.

2117
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:51,360
And, you know, and they're just, you know...

2118
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:51,720
I am locked.

2119
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,040
We're... five, two.

2120
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:03,680
And then two...

2121
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,560
Two.

2122
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,420
Okay and two.

2123
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:09,500
Okay.

2124
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,480
Mama not you not you not you not you.

2125
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:19,740
Oh wait, it could be you... but you and you, what is it making?

2126
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,580
You guys can't tell yet?

2127
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,920
Oh wait, it is not.

2128
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,160
I can't... Lollipop?

2129
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,720
Magnifying glass?

2130
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,680
Ahhh... maybe... maybe...

2131
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,940
I think you guys weren't right.

2132
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,800
I wish I would tell you.

2133
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,840
It just makes you...

2134
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,340
Assume, I suppose.

2135
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,020
Let's see, we have five here.

2136
01:17:58,740 --> 01:17:59,940
Two, three, four there.

2137
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,820
Alright, that's complete.

2138
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,460
And you.

2139
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,080
And you.

2140
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:05,880
And...

2141
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,380
Three, and... wait.

2142
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,820
Oh, is it gonna be a question mark?

2143
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,860
Probably, right?

2144
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,860
It'll probably be a question mark in the middle.

2145
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,540
That's kinda cute.

2146
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,220
Like, if it's like that...

2147
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,180
I'm... I'm guessing.

2148
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,200
Don't wanna get ahead of myself.

2149
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,380
I'm almost positive it's a question mark.

2150
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,640
Wait, oh... like that?

2151
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,840
Take that, puzzle.

2152
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,040
You're solved.

2153
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,380
Yeah!

2154
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,240
Okay, that's the last one I'll do.

2155
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,780
For now.

2156
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,640
Back through my relaxing walk through the gardens.

2157
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,140
Where are we?

2158
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,360
Oh,

2159
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:53,000
wait up.

2160
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,780
What does it want me to do?

2161
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:56,580
Where does it want me to go?

2162
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,800
Oh, let's go talk to the lady.

2163
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:00,640
What's going on?

2164
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,060
I should listen in.

2165
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,840
You are so nosy.

2166
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:04,700
The strange sounds.

2167
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,420
On the pounding.

2168
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,360
On the screaming.

2169
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:07,680
At all hours of the night.

2170
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,180
Waking up my family.

2171
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,080
Scaring the children half to death.

2172
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,820
If you ask me, this rear can needs to be closed down.

2173
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,280
Immediately.

2174
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:16,460
I'm...

2175
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,360
Very sorry.

2176
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,200
Sorry change is nothing.

2177
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,800
This is unacceptable.

2178
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,140
I want my money back.

2179
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,340
And I want a car sent immediately.

2180
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,120
What is the accent?

2181
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:25,780
She's German.

2182
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:26,960
I think.

2183
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,420
Pretty sure.

2184
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,500
Who?

2185
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,020
Uh...

2186
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,460
I didn't mean to listen in, but um...

2187
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,080
Oh damn!

2188
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,100
All the names are gone except us and Williams.

2189
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,100
Sama.

2190
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,200
Williams-sama.

2191
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:45,540
Um...

2192
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:45,960
Are you okay?

2193
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,020
Oh.

2194
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,460
Hello, Nancy-san.

2195
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,460
That guest seemed pretty upset.

2196
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,020
Nancy-san.

2197
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,360
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

2198
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,440
Trust me.

2199
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:59,120
I see a lot at this desk and one thing never changes.

2200
01:19:59,120 --> 01:19:59,520
Is...

2201
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,280
Travel is disorienting.

2202
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:05,000
It's so very easy to get upset when you are far from home.

2203
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,980
That's why we try to make things as comfortable as possible.

2204
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,240
Um...

2205
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:11,540
Uh...

2206
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,900
What has been scaring the guests away?

2207
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,320
What has been scaring the guests away?

2208
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:14,720
Yeah.

2209
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:15,580
Nothing.

2210
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:17,040
They're not scared.

2211
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:17,820
It's...

2212
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:18,600
Something else.

2213
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,760
Can I help you with anything?

2214
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:21,460
I...

2215
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,900
I heard what she said.

2216
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,440
I'll stop bugging you now.

2217
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,060
Okay.

2218
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,500
See ya.

2219
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,380
Matane.

2220
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:27,500
Okay.

2221
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:31,900
Can I leave?

2222
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:32,940
Can I go to Pachinko?

2223
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,220
Oh, wait.

2224
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,040
I need a dictionary to translate that.

2225
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:38,640
I have it.

2226
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,240
I have it.

2227
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,260
A phrase book.

2228
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,000
Oh!

2229
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:41,440
Si!

2230
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,280
Tran.

2231
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,020
We're going to...

2232
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:47,540
Nagoya?

2233
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:48,620
Wait a second.

2234
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,960
That's like kind of far.

2235
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,100
Wait.

2236
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,120
Misawa?

2237
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:55,880
What?

2238
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,480
Oh, I don't think this is accurate.

2239
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,400
Wait a second.

2240
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,360
I don't think this is accurate.

2241
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,260
We're in Kyoto.

2242
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:11,340
We're going to...

2243
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,540
Omiya!

2244
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:14,860
Wait.

2245
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,420
Narita is...

2246
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:16,760
Wait.

2247
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:18,980
Nara is...

2248
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:19,500
Wait.

2249
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,760
I don't think this is accurate.

2250
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,360
Chiba is south.

2251
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,780
Is Sendai is south too?

2252
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:28,900
Um...

2253
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,620
I don't think...

2254
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,640
How is Kyoto east of Tokyo?

2255
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,080
No.

2256
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:38,780
It's...

2257
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:39,720
Where is...

2258
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,060
No.

2259
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,040
Because we are here.

2260
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,520
This is...

2261
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:42,860
This is...

2262
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:43,220
This would be...

2263
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:44,000
Right...

2264
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,860
Right-ish.

2265
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,620
But...

2266
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,240
Well...

2267
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,940
That it's west.

2268
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:47,580
It's west.

2269
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:49,620
But...

2270
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,440
I do...

2271
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:50,880
Um...

2272
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,260
This is...

2273
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:52,920
This is...

2274
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,380
Actually, when people say...

2275
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,480
Don't be scared of the train system in Japan.

2276
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,660
It's not that complicated.

2277
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,700
This is not giving anybody...

2278
01:21:59,700 --> 01:21:59,940
Look!

2279
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,880
Osaka is all the way over here!

2280
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,900
What?

2281
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:03,680
What?

2282
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:08,680
This is not giving anybody...

2283
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,040
Any hope that it's...

2284
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:10,460
Better.

2285
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,540
Map not to scale.

2286
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:15,900
Osaka all the way here.

2287
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:19,460
Yep.

2288
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:21,580
Alright.

2289
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,560
We know where we're going.

2290
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,500
To Nagoya!

2291
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,160
Otsu!

2292
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,280
Otsu Mintau!

2293
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,020
Can I leave?

2294
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,060
Can I go explore?

2295
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,660
Can I get out of here?

2296
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,040
I guess we're going to Otsu.

2297
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:38,360
Why?

2298
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:38,960
What's here?

2299
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,520
What is at this place?

2300
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:42,580
Why is...

2301
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,800
This is like a really...

2302
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,000
A rundown looking station.

2303
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:45,880
It looks like New York.

2304
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:48,600
Oh!

2305
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:49,740
Wait!

2306
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:52,200
We're just casually going to Tokyo.

2307
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,080
What?

2308
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:53,660
Ow!

2309
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,060
Boy!

2310
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:57,900
Okay.

2311
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,940
Where should we go?

2312
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,500
We could go...

2313
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,920
Where are we going?

2314
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,560
Let's just go to Tokyo, baby.

2315
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:14,170
Wait.

2316
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:14,810
I can't leave.

2317
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,210
I can't even go to Tokyo.

2318
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:16,950
Why not?

2319
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:19,670
Um...

2320
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:20,350
Naro?

2321
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:24,510
Akita?

2322
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:29,520
Am I...

2323
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,120
Is this a...

2324
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,720
Where am I supposed to go?

2325
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,620
Is the question.

2326
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,400
I feel.

2327
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,600
What is like the...

2328
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,880
And Draco, thank you so much for the 20 gift.

2329
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:45,580
Thank you.

2330
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,860
This is the maze puzzle.

2331
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:51,700
Oh my god.

2332
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:51,960
Oh my god.

2333
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,300
No way.

2334
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,080
I mean, it's not really a puzzle though.

2335
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,560
I just need to know where to get to.

2336
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,600
Yeah, what's the goal?

2337
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:03,340
Um...

2338
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:03,660
Let's see.

2339
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:04,680
Maybe...

2340
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,120
Nope.

2341
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:05,560
Never mind.

2342
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:05,800
Sorry.

2343
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:06,520
Wrong book.

2344
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:09,460
Uh...

2345
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,200
Uh...

2346
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,000
Uh...

2347
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,440
Uh...

2348
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,220
Rio-con room.

2349
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,200
Yeah, we're so far from Kyoto now.

2350
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:24,450
Is this butterfly?

2351
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:25,770
Ay, ay, ay.

2352
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:30,140
Uh...

2353
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,220
Bess, where are you?

2354
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,600
Whoa.

2355
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,380
Uh...

2356
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:35,660
Wait.

2357
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,460
Kurei Station.

2358
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,100
Okay, kurei...

2359
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:40,800
Kurei...

2360
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,200
Kurei...

2361
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,220
Kurei...

2362
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:45,640
Kurei...

2363
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,220
Kurei...

2364
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,760
This map is making me crazy.

2365
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,760
Oh, here, here, here, here.

2366
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,240
Okay, okay.

2367
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,060
So, we are at Akita.

2368
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:59,000
We can go... Let's see.

2369
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,260
What would be the easiest way, I suppose?

2370
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:10,480
We could go around on the green line.

2371
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,740
Oli desu.

2372
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:14,640
Crazy Oli.

2373
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:24,320
I was watching her on... On, um... Michi's 3D debut.

2374
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,500
We took the train from Kyoto to Hokkaido.

2375
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:29,900
It's fine.

2376
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:30,840
Yeah, obviously.

2377
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,200
Yeah, where this is the best train ever.

2378
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:46,760
I think we could go to... Wait, hold on.

2379
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,440
Oh, the... I think... Oh, the... Yeah, okay.

2380
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:56,300
It shows only two stops per station that intersects.

2381
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,020
So... We could go up to Nara and then Sayo.

2382
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:05,020
And then go down to... Uji.

2383
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,160
Okay, all right.

2384
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:07,260
Nara... Wait.

2385
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,700
What did I just say?

2386
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:09,760
We were going... Nara?

2387
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,280
Nara, then Sayo.

2388
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:15,920
Nara, then Sayo.

2389
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:17,860
Then Fuji.

2390
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,680
Oh, gee.

2391
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,780
All these stations look really similar.

2392
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,600
Then Izumo.

2393
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,980
Oh, no!

2394
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,520
I just noticed it's...

2395
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,900
Okay, I'm stupid.

2396
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,500
I even said...

2397
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,260
Each one only has two lines that it goes to.

2398
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,740
I thought...

2399
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:08,720
Did you hear Hikari and Nozomi...

2400
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,820
Not even a little bit.

2401
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,840
They're so easy.

2402
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,320
Yay!

2403
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:14,680
Pachinko!

2404
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,820
And ramen...

2405
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:19,580
Let's see.

2406
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,500
Where can we go to?

2407
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,040
Only to Pachinko.

2408
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:23,960
Okay.

2409
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,460
Oh my god.

2410
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,370
Oh!

2411
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:32,350
Fun, love, smile, boom, koala!

2412
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:35,450
Shudder, clunker.

2413
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:38,410
Printed, tada.

2414
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:39,370
Oh!

2415
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:40,290
Koala.

2416
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:41,230
Naito.

2417
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,150
обязательно.

2418
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:45,570
Oh my

2419
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:51,770
god.

2420
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:52,770
Oh my god.

2421
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:52,890
A little girl.

2422
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:59,090
Oh my god.

2423
01:27:59,090 --> 01:27:59,610
Oh my god.

2424
01:27:59,610 --> 01:27:59,630
Oh my god.

2425
01:27:59,630 --> 01:27:59,690
Okay.

2426
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:01,730
What are the devs kids?

2427
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,170
Maybe?

2428
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:16,150
Oh my god.

2429
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:16,970
The photo is printed.

2430
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:28,780
Ew.

2431
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,300
Let's try again, Nancy.

2432
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:32,700
Out of order!

2433
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,200
Book was printed?

2434
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,490
What the hell is my background?

2435
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,130
Wait, what the hell?

2436
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:55,890
What do I have on here?

2437
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:56,990
Oh, one out of 30.

2438
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:57,330
Okay.

2439
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:01,790
Can I try again?

2440
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:05,730
Connect phone, choose photos, press print.

2441
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,910
Oh, it doesn't work.

2442
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:08,950
My eyes.

2443
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:10,450
God, this is so funny.

2444
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:18,030
And my other favorite part about it is the plane that's carrying a flag that just says bird.

2445
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,510
Oh.

2446
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:26,790
Bird.

2447
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:30,550
Let me out of here, Nancy Drew.

2448
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:32,030
Alright.

2449
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,790
Oh, we got the vending machine.

2450
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,710
Ooh.

2451
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:39,530
Exchange.

2452
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,350
This is so dead in here.

2453
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,690
It's also so quiet.

2454
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:44,990
Here we go.

2455
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,600
I need to find a card first before I can play Pachinko.

2456
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,880
What do you mean a card?

2457
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,520
That Yurei comic looks interesting.

2458
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,900
I should check it out.

2459
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
A Yurei comic?

2460
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,420
What do you mean by that?

2461
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:04,880
Wait, which one?

2462
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:05,620
This?

2463
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:06,060
This?

2464
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,920
Wait, I want the Yurei comic.

2465
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,860
I'd like to see what the comic has to say about hauntings.

2466
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:14,340
Me too!

2467
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,660
I would love to hear that.

2468
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,000
Wait, where do we get a card at, Nancy Drew?

2469
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:20,740
Where?

2470
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:23,100
No.

2471
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,100
A card.

2472
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,140
Where do we get it?

2473
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,680
Left side of the door?

2474
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,100
I tried clicking that.

2475
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,820
Oh yeah, hold on.

2476
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:34,780
Oh gosh, sometimes turning around is such a pain in the butt.

2477
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:36,280
No, please!

2478
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,380
Yeah, see here, it won't let you do anything.

2479
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:52,190
So we came all the way here for nothing?

2480
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:57,450
Oh my god.

2481
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:05,830
Yurei, what does it mean?

2482
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:06,350
Ghost.

2483
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:10,410
Well, unless you're asking, like, I don't know.

2484
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,500
Okay, we'll go the yellow line.

2485
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,800
To Ube.

2486
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:21,880
Yellow line to Ube.

2487
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:22,920
So we go Izumo.

2488
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:25,240
Wait, where am I?

2489
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:26,960
Oh, we can't?

2490
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,720
Oh, Izumo is...

2491
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,200
Oh, dang it.

2492
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,640
I did it again.

2493
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:34,700
Wait, we can go to Sakai.

2494
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,360
Sakai.

2495
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,440
The most lively Japan has ever been.

2496
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,440
Two Yuri haunting comics, please.

2497
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,920
One for me and one for Nancy Drew.

2498
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,780
We go to...

2499
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,620
Ube.

2500
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,360
Yurei.

2501
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,400
No Amito.

2502
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:59,520
Amito.

2503
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,900
And then...

2504
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,640
To...

2505
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,020
Oh, more?

2506
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:13,600
From Aomori?

2507
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,580
Then from Aomori...

2508
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,580
We can go to...

2509
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,340
Uh...

2510
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,280
Nagoya?

2511
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:28,460
And Misawa.

2512
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:31,650
Dang, what a...

2513
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:32,630
What a waste of our time.

2514
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:35,430
We've wasted, like, two weeks on this trip.

2515
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:36,810
Hahaha!

2516
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:38,010
Our children!

2517
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,370
They're like, when is...

2518
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:39,890
When is...

2519
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:41,610
When is Drew-sama coming back...

2520
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:43,410
To grade our papers?

2521
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:44,070
Hahaha!

2522
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:48,390
Okay.

2523
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:49,330
Awesome.

2524
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:52,070
Uh...

2525
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:53,750
What do I do?

2526
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:55,990
Hey, mister.

2527
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:58,330
What's going on at this place?

2528
01:32:58,590 --> 01:33:00,190
Oh, do you believe that the Ryokan is haunted?

2529
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:02,410
Do you believe that the Ryokan is haunted?

2530
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,090
Sorry, the Ryokan.

2531
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:04,910
I don't believe that anything is haunted.

2532
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:06,130
Gasp!

2533
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:06,990
Ghosts, uh...

2534
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:10,830
Are just what happens when guilty people let their imaginations run wild.

2535
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:13,390
What do you mean?

2536
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:14,230
What do you mean?

2537
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,530
Think about it.

2538
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,470
Why do ghosts always want revenge?

2539
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:21,970
They're what people invent when they feel guilty.

2540
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:26,210
If that wasn't the case, then ghosts would want all sorts of things.

2541
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:29,370
But no, they always want revenge.

2542
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,230
I'm back for more nonograms!

2543
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:33,690
Hahaha!

2544
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:36,730
Oh wait, he's got the portrait from the lobby.

2545
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,210
Is that the portrait from the lobby?

2546
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:38,930
Yeah.

2547
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:40,350
I'm reframing it.

2548
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:44,090
Although it's way harder to do than I thought it would be.

2549
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,810
It's got a really strange backing.

2550
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:47,190
I'm guilty.

2551
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:48,470
Would you like some help?

2552
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:49,450
Have at it!

2553
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,550
I mean, I do want revenge, but...

2554
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:52,230
This thing is officially making me nuts!

2555
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,590
The tools you'll need are neither frame.

2556
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:58,090
Okay, now I'm a professional restorer.

2557
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:58,430
Okay.

2558
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:02,490
It looks like I need to find a way to make sure none of the wires are crossing.

2559
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:04,070
Oh.

2560
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:05,850
Sorry, Nancy Drew.

2561
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,790
Need someone to do nonograms and travel on trains non-stop?

2562
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,290
Nancy Drew is on the case!

2563
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:12,550
Mint is real to me.

2564
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:13,670
I'm real!

2565
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:16,710
I'm real, I promise.

2566
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:17,670
Revengeance.

2567
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:20,050
Oh, okay.

2568
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:21,770
I can just place them anywhere, it seems.

2569
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:24,090
Oh, golly.

2570
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:25,130
What the hell?

2571
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:26,870
How am I supposed to make them knock?

2572
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:27,690
None of them...

2573
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:27,950
Wait, wait.

2574
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:29,170
None of them cross?

2575
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:34,290
Impossible.

2576
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,050
Impossible.

2577
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:40,790
Maybe.

2578
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:47,490
Maybe.

2579
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:47,590
Maybe.

2580
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:49,970
I don't know.

2581
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,970
Maybe I shouldn't have chosen senior citizen.

2582
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,710
Oh, now the creepy music is back.

2583
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:08,890
Impossible.

2584
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,220
Oh, dang.

2585
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,440
I was gonna say, those aren't crossing, but they are.

2586
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,520
Maybe like that.

2587
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,460
It's getting a little less webby.

2588
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,400
Wouldn't you want them to cross?

2589
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:34,680
What?

2590
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:36,140
Who created this contraption?

2591
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,940
What kind of...

2592
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,580
Sadistic...

2593
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:40,740
Creature?

2594
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:46,380
Senior investigator.

2595
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:48,660
Senior citizen.

2596
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,500
This guy's hard too, cause he's like connected to all...

2597
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,120
Four that I have in the corner.

2598
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,120
Maybe I shouldn't put them in the corner.

2599
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,400
I don't know.

2600
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,020
Holy moly.

2601
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:04,440
You're just a figment of my guilty conscience.

2602
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:05,560
Wow.

2603
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,240
What are you guilty of?

2604
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:07,480
Huh?

2605
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,760
What are you guilty of?

2606
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,040
Move them inwards.

2607
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:13,540
These ones?

2608
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:27,190
Oh my gosh.

2609
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:28,850
I feel even more lost than before.

2610
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:44,250
What's like a hint for this?

2611
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:45,970
I don't want to use her tips.

2612
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:47,170
She'll cost me.

2613
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:48,530
She'll charge me.

2614
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:50,290
She'll be like...

2615
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:51,830
One hint is one dollar.

2616
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,150
You guys wouldn't charge me.

2617
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,500
I got no clue.

2618
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,260
Can they overlap...

2619
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,220
The buttons?

2620
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:09,340
Doesn't seem like it.

2621
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,480
If we'd charge two...

2622
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:21,340
Put the ones with a lot of connections in the middle and put direct connections right on...

2623
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:22,140
Next to each other.

2624
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,060
Wait, so like this in the middle?

2625
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,260
This in the middle?

2626
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:33,660
This...

2627
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:34,720
Can they cross themselves?

2628
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,080
This one in the middle?

2629
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:38,620
Okay.

2630
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,300
Direct...

2631
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,060
Next to each other.

2632
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,260
But this one is connected to so many.

2633
01:37:57,330 --> 01:38:00,790
It looks just as bad as it did when I first started.

2634
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:21,930
It looks just as bad as it did when I first started.

2635
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:26,950
More like Nancy screwed on my right.

2636
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:27,670
Damn!

2637
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:30,710
Nancy Drew, I'm too dumb for this!

2638
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:34,170
Okay, RZ, thank you so much for the gifted.

2639
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:34,830
Thank you.

2640
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:43,330
Oh...

2641
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:45,550
Oh...

2642
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,550
See like these...

2643
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:48,450
This...

2644
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:48,800
Maybe...

2645
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:50,850
Over here...

2646
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:51,250
Oh...

2647
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:52,590
Oh gosh...

2648
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:54,870
I can't tell where anything needs to go!

2649
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:58,890
Ha ha ha ha...

2650
01:38:58,890 --> 01:38:59,290
Ha ha ha ha...

2651
01:38:59,290 --> 01:38:59,750
Ha ha ha ha...

2652
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,010
Ha ha ha...

2653
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,870
Maybe I'll put these over here.

2654
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:05,590
This...

2655
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:13,850
I

2656
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:22,090
don't know where to place these little buttons on the board.

2657
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:25,290
I don't know what to do.

2658
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:27,910
Someone help me!

2659
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,500
Why does it look like the stick bug?

2660
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:41,000
It does.

2661
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:47,860
The hell...

2662
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,040
What the hell...

2663
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,440
Okay, where's our hint?

2664
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,020
Oh, because I play...

2665
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,400
I don't need a task list because I'm playing as a senior!

2666
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,200
Oh, I shouldn't have played as a senior detective.

2667
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:06,800
Oh...

2668
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:09,030
Check!

2669
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:12,630
Oh...

2670
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:13,890
Where's my hints?

2671
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:15,590
Where's my hints?

2672
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:19,430
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait...

2673
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,170
Uh...

2674
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:20,970
Quick, exit, exit.

2675
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:22,510
Where's my hints?

2676
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:23,430
That's the truth!

2677
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:31,830
Use the direct connections to make an outer circle, then work inward.

2678
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:35,770
Direct connections like this...

2679
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:36,950
And this...

2680
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:37,170
And...

2681
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:37,830
Like what I...

2682
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:38,970
Like, kind of what I have?

2683
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:40,270
Okay...

2684
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:41,150
Okay...

2685
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:41,670
So...

2686
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:42,190
This...

2687
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:43,250
Maybe here...

2688
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:43,670
Right?

2689
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:46,870
And then...

2690
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:48,570
Like that...

2691
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:48,970
Okay...

2692
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:50,770
Make a circle...

2693
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:51,890
Make a circle...

2694
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:54,150
Make a circle...

2695
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:54,290
Make a circle...

2696
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:54,430
Make a circle...

2697
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:55,590
Oh, see, this one's hard!

2698
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,690
Because I have them on the opposite side!

2699
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:00,830
Okay, hold on...

2700
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:02,390
Make a circle...

2701
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:03,510
Make a circle...

2702
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:05,250
See, this looks so clean now...

2703
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:05,890
Or cleaner...

2704
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:07,290
Kind of...

2705
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,870
More like senior citizen...

2706
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,890
More like senior citizen...

2707
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:17,810
That's what I said!

2708
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:31,770
Ugh...

2709
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,080
Okay...

2710
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,040
Okay...

2711
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:44,400
Okay...

2712
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,780
Okay, this...

2713
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,200
This...

2714
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,020
This is all good!

2715
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,140
This is all good!

2716
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:50,880
Okay, hold on...

2717
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,580
I'm gonna scoot it...

2718
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:52,040
Scoot...

2719
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,200
Scoot it over a little...

2720
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:54,640
Oh wait, it's not all good!

2721
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,220
There's this guy here...

2722
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:57,700
Ugh...

2723
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,660
We're getting close!

2724
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:00,000
We're getting close!

2725
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:05,100
Ish...

2726
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:08,810
Eeeee...

2727
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:20,850
Eeeee...

2728
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:22,270
Eeeee...

2729
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:23,490
Eeeee...

2730
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:24,210
Eeeee...

2731
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:26,910
Agh...

2732
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:28,270
Agh...

2733
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:32,170
Lois went up...

2734
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:32,490
This one?

2735
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:36,540
This one?

2736
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,000
I'm not done...

2737
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:37,480
I'm having...

2738
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,720
I want to touch this area real quick...

2739
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,000
Not yet...

2740
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:45,950
This guy is also...

2741
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:47,030
A pain in my...

2742
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:49,290
Side...

2743
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:50,930
Oh...

2744
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,140
It looks so clean...

2745
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,020
And then you notice...

2746
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:01,560
That it's like...

2747
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,140
Not...

2748
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,760
No...

2749
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,260
No...

2750
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:08,020
Like you...

2751
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:08,560
Oh my god!

2752
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:09,140
What?

2753
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:10,880
This is so...

2754
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:14,800
Seeing even here!

2755
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:15,880
Oh no...

2756
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,480
Eeeee...

2757
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:28,490
Like here looks good...

2758
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:29,510
Until you see this...

2759
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:34,960
Sometimes it looks so clean...

2760
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,200
That I...

2761
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:35,420
It...

2762
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,560
I don't feel like it...

2763
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:36,900
Like...

2764
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:37,120
Look...

2765
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:37,360
Look...

2766
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,140
It looks like almost...

2767
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:39,080
It should be fine...

2768
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:39,580
But then I'm like...

2769
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:40,340
Wait a second...

2770
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:42,180
This is not fine...

2771
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,700
I have no stinking idea...

2772
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:57,220
On the other side...

2773
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:58,040
Pull the top...

2774
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:58,480
Middle...

2775
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,000
Down...

2776
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,780
Below the line...

2777
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,400
This...

2778
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:04,500
This...

2779
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,180
What line...

2780
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,940
What are you talking about?

2781
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:10,780
This...

2782
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,840
Lower all the nodes...

2783
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:15,540
On the right side...

2784
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,700
To fix the middle connections...

2785
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:25,520
Huh...

2786
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,520
It doesn't fix anything...

2787
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,240
Because this doesn't work.

2788
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:36,280
And this doesn't work.

2789
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,200
This doesn't work.

2790
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,100
This doesn't work.

2791
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:55,670
This is so, actually so tricky.

2792
01:44:57,870 --> 01:44:59,410
Topmost to the far left.

2793
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,750
That doesn't... sorry, that doesn't help me.

2794
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:04,290
Pray for me.

2795
01:45:04,410 --> 01:45:05,130
Welcome to Bad Pusha.

2796
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:05,850
Thank you.

2797
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:08,630
I wish I was playing no-no-grams right now.

2798
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:12,870
Can I go back to no-no-grams, please?

2799
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:17,270
I want more no-no-grams, please.

2800
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:28,130
It doesn't work.

2801
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:34,570
I don't even know how to focus.

2802
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:35,250
It's like...

2803
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:38,630
I don't even know how to position them to make it...

2804
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,770
Like, that's where...

2805
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:42,150
I don't even know...

2806
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:44,370
How...

2807
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:46,770
To even... Like, what to focus on...

2808
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:48,050
To make it work!

2809
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:03,240
Bring internal crosses...

2810
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:06,140
Wait, bring internal with crosses to the outside.

2811
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:06,980
So, like that.

2812
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,020
But then there's a cross.

2813
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,940
I don't think that helps, no?

2814
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:29,080
Stop going randomly and fix them in linked groups.

2815
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:30,560
But I don't know how!

2816
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:33,520
Like, I don't even know how to fix this!

2817
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,220
I don't know how to fix it!

2818
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:40,080
I'm not just trying to be random.

2819
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:43,020
I am trying to fix it, but I don't know how!

2820
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:44,720
Maybe...

2821
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,080
Maybe...

2822
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,020
What's still touching?

2823
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,300
A whole lot of stuff!

2824
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,820
There's a lot of stuff that's touching.

2825
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:01,460
You just fixed it?

2826
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,080
No, I didn't.

2827
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:07,900
What, this?

2828
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,380
No, it did not fix it at all.

2829
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:21,140
I think it's because what I have set...

2830
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:23,320
Looks nice and pretty to me...

2831
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,580
But I need to move things.

2832
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,320
You know what I mean?

2833
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:34,040
Okay,

2834
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:39,980
let's see.

2835
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:49,170
This guy... I have no idea.

2836
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:50,830
Ugh!

2837
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:53,570
Gotta undo your work to progress.

2838
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:54,650
I think so too.

2839
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:57,270
Yeah, I think that's what I gotta do.

2840
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:59,890
But my brain doesn't want me to!

2841
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:01,410
Ugh!

2842
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:04,410
My brain is literally like, don't do it!

2843
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:05,610
It looks good.

2844
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:09,630
What kind of sadist created this contraption?

2845
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:10,750
I'll kill them.

2846
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:13,810
I will be the ghost hunting this real kind.

2847
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,480
Is there a reset?

2848
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:20,040
I don't know.

2849
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:23,520
Maybe if I leave... No.

2850
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:24,160
Damn.

2851
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:28,940
Okay, let's focus on this area first.

2852
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,280
So... What

2853
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:38,520
the hell?

2854
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,300
I think this is impossible.

2855
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:41,900
Nancy Drew...

2856
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:44,580
Nancy Drew... Nancy!

2857
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,700
I just did what I did before, but made it wider.

2858
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:50,200
Nancy!

2859
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,160
Okay.

2860
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,820
Let's do this.

2861
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:57,380
Maybe like that.

2862
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,460
Like this?

2863
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:08,100
Oh no!

2864
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:08,680
This guy!

2865
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:10,240
Oh gosh!

2866
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:11,120
Ugh!

2867
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:15,060
Ugh!

2868
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,120
Okay, hold on.

2869
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,920
This guy is... This guy is ruining my mood.

2870
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:30,170
Can I just... Why don't we just break it?

2871
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:31,590
Why don't we just cut it?

2872
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:35,590
Just... It's... The frame is already broken though.

2873
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:46,330
Oh no!

2874
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:47,730
I just realized... Ah!

2875
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:53,110
Okay, ones with a lot of connections go in the middle maybe.

2876
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:55,430
I see people saying that, so we'll try it.

2877
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:58,610
That's... These...

2878
01:49:59,170 --> 01:49:59,990
These ones.

2879
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:00,370
Okay.

2880
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:01,230
These ones.

2881
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:01,230
Okay.

2882
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:05,150
Let's try it.

2883
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:05,510
Ugh.

2884
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:09,330
The ones with the most connections to the corners?

2885
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:11,650
I think we tried that and it didn't...

2886
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,320
Like this seems impossible.

2887
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,800
I don't think this works.

2888
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,360
Because look at this.

2889
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,400
There's too much... There's too much overlap.

2890
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:31,760
There's the most overlap ever.

2891
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,360
This is the hardest puzzle ever.

2892
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:41,360
What the hell?

2893
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:45,380
Nancy, Drew, just break it.

2894
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:45,760
Hold on.

2895
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:52,340
Let me... It looks like I need to find a way to make sure none of the wires are crossing.

2896
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:53,300
Ugh!

2897
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:53,920
Nancy!

2898
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,920
Nancy, I don't think this... This is possible.

2899
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,180
I want the nonograms.

2900
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:07,880
Find pins with three connections or less and make a circle with them.

2901
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:11,580
Are there any like that?

2902
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:12,100
Four?

2903
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:13,200
Four?

2904
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:16,980
I don't think there... I don't think there are any with three or less.

2905
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,340
There's... There's all... They're all four!

2906
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,680
There are none with three or less.

2907
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,900
Each line can only touch two unbroken...

2908
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:27,440
broken shapes.

2909
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:32,040
So I think if you try to make shapes... One at a time it should be slow and steady way to do it.

2910
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:35,520
Huh?

2911
01:51:42,210 --> 01:51:43,450
Top left has three.

2912
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:44,110
Oh.

2913
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:45,950
Yeah, but that's the only one.

2914
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:47,950
I can't make a shape with a single guy.

2915
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:49,270
I need scissors.

2916
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:50,590
I need an adult!

2917
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:58,770
This is gonna put me... I'm gonna be in the senior citizen home and be like... I'm a... I'm a senior... Detective!

2918
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:00,870
This is gonna be...

2919
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:12,360
Then go four or less and make a circle.

2920
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:15,600
Okay.

2921
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:17,420
There are ones with four.

2922
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,840
But not you.

2923
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:26,450
Uh... I made a circle.

2924
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:29,910
Huh?

2925
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:30,310
Huh?

2926
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:30,890
Huh?

2927
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:08,520
This music is really... Oh

2928
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:14,900
my god, this one too.

2929
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,740
This is really sending me, huh?

2930
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:17,560
What?

2931
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:18,240
What the hell?

2932
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:19,260
What the hell?

2933
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:19,960
I'm looking it up.

2934
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:20,840
Fuck this.

2935
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,900
Nancy Drill.

2936
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:29,120
Wire puzzle.

2937
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:43,980
What?

2938
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:50,710
R slash Nancy Drew.

2939
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:52,870
Puzzle Rant.

2940
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:54,790
The picture frame in Saw.

2941
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:55,950
This puzzle.

2942
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,910
I almost wasn't able to finish... Oh, Saw.

2943
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:01,050
I guess that's the...

2944
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:02,050
Secret water.

2945
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:03,770
I thought you meant, like, Saw the movie.

2946
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:08,390
You can...

2947
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:13,190
Try moving the longest direct connections closer and gradually move the nodes...

2948
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:15,570
You think you're done with towards the outside.

2949
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:19,830
There may be times you need to flip orders of nodes.

2950
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:23,990
This is an infamous one, huh?

2951
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:24,330
Yeah.

2952
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:30,730
I was fear... I was... I was... I was... Wait, this... I want to read this rant.

2953
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:35,730
I was almost... I almost wasn't able to finish the game because of it.

2954
01:54:35,890 --> 01:54:38,730
I have been trying for ages to get past this puzzle.

2955
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:42,310
And after hours and hours of work, it finally paid off.

2956
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:45,050
I was worried at first that I wouldn't like the game.

2957
01:54:45,190 --> 01:54:52,890
And therefore wasted so much time and most of it in furious anger at her for making this demonic evil puzzle.

2958
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:54,490
But I'm really glad I... No.

2959
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:55,210
Never mind.

2960
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:56,990
This puzzle never again.

2961
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:58,090
It's terrible.

2962
01:54:58,390 --> 01:55:01,310
Easily one of the hardest ones in this series.

2963
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:09,580
Oh my god!

2964
01:55:14,610 --> 01:55:15,910
Oh my god!

2965
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:23,580
The worst part about it... Someone said the worst part is that if you decide to give up and look at a walkthrough...

2966
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:24,360
It doesn't help!

2967
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:27,520
Because now all the buttons aren't in the same place!

2968
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:28,860
No!

2969
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:42,630
They're right!

2970
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:45,050
Oh, holy...

2971
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:47,010
Okay...

2972
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:47,790
Oh gosh...

2973
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:48,850
I don't know!

2974
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:54,530
Oh my gosh...

2975
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:54,830
Just...

2976
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,090
When they said Saw though...

2977
01:55:56,090 --> 01:55:57,150
What's this game called?

2978
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:57,670
The...

2979
01:55:57,670 --> 01:55:58,010
The...

2980
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:00,690
Shadow at the water's edge or whatever?

2981
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:03,850
I guess they abbreviate it to Saw.

2982
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:07,370
But...

2983
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:09,530
But...

2984
01:56:12,230 --> 01:56:13,830
I'm double checking it.

2985
01:56:15,610 --> 01:56:17,990
Yeah, shadow at the water's edge.

2986
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:18,980
It's...

2987
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:19,870
This...

2988
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:23,170
This feels like though that it would be an actual puzzle in...

2989
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:24,210
Like the...

2990
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:25,610
The torture movie Saw.

2991
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:31,250
Like it feels like this is not real!

2992
01:56:33,170 --> 01:56:34,930
This is not real!

2993
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:37,210
Wait...

2994
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:37,580
That...

2995
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:38,830
Almost works.

2996
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:42,070
Look, this almost works.

2997
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:43,850
Maybe.

2998
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:48,400
You're still here?

2999
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:48,840
Oh yeah!

3000
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Bing Bong, you wanna try?

3001
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,660
Yeah, you wanna try?

3002
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:54,980
Oh!

3003
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:58,160
Okay, hold on.

3004
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:02,740
Bing Bong over here is a genius.

3005
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,920
Says he'll get it immediately for his try.

3006
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:13,340
You can do it easy?

3007
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:13,740
Okay.

3008
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:15,680
I wish I could have...

3009
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,500
Twitch Plays...

3010
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:19,260
Mean Toast Dream.

3011
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:20,100
Twitch Plays...

3012
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:21,720
Antidrew.

3013
01:57:31,610 --> 01:57:34,490
I seriously just don't...

3014
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:35,730
I don't know.

3015
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:41,650
It is actually just mind-boggling to me right now.

3016
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:43,370
Because as soon as I cross...

3017
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:45,150
One thing, it crosses another!

3018
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:47,370
Vivicor, who are you?

3019
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,690
Thank you for the gift.

3020
01:57:57,710 --> 01:58:00,610
The one in the middle, move it outside and you have it.

3021
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:01,370
What, this one?

3022
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:02,670
Like that?

3023
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:03,570
There you go.

3024
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:05,190
The problem is solved.

3025
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:09,010
The problem is solved.

3026
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:21,220
To the top.

3027
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:24,500
Okay.

3028
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:31,090
Good job, team.

3029
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:33,530
Good job, team.

3030
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:38,950
I made a cool...

3031
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:43,890
Wait, no.

3032
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:44,750
That doesn't work.

3033
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,220
Just cut it, Nancy Drew!

3034
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:02,240
Nancy Drew, just...

3035
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:03,300
Just cut.

3036
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:04,780
Just cut it.

3037
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:06,600
Please, God.

3038
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:10,440
Just destroy the frame.

3039
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,920
Just destroy the frame!

3040
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:25,940
We're like making a little...

3041
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:28,560
Something or other here.

3042
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:32,780
But this doesn't work.

3043
01:59:38,030 --> 01:59:42,950
I wish I could just see what the shape is that some people are finishing their puzzles with.

3044
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:43,530
You know what I mean?

3045
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:01,540
Can we bring the music back?

3046
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:05,340
Oh, it doesn't work.

3047
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:07,860
It doesn't work.

3048
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,060
Oh,

3049
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:18,800
my God.

3050
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:26,750
What?

3051
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:28,110
I'm lost again.

3052
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:29,570
I've been lost from the start.

3053
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:32,230
I've been lost from the start.

3054
02:00:33,570 --> 02:00:34,870
Nancy Drew, please.

3055
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:40,290
I don't think this is tangible progress.

3056
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:42,030
Oh, quite honestly.

3057
02:00:42,510 --> 02:00:43,050
Hold on.

3058
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:43,510
I'm gonna see.

3059
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:50,830
I just looked up what the finished look of the puzzle is.

3060
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:51,850
Let me see.

3061
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:56,990
First picture.

3062
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:02,870
No, it's not first for me.

3063
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:07,490
Uh, definitely not that one from the Reddit.

3064
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:09,430
Oh, wait.

3065
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:10,610
Oh!

3066
02:01:10,890 --> 02:01:11,110
Oh!

3067
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:11,750
I see one!

3068
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:12,330
I see one!

3069
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:13,590
Okay.

3070
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:14,510
Okay.

3071
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:15,430
The one with three.

3072
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:18,390
It's here.

3073
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:18,870
Okay.

3074
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:19,750
You know what?

3075
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:21,490
We're just gonna cheese this a little bit.

3076
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:21,810
Okay.

3077
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:22,950
Then this goes...

3078
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:23,630
This...

3079
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:24,310
No, it doesn't.

3080
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:24,850
What?

3081
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:26,330
This goes...

3082
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:27,530
Wait.

3083
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:29,370
Wait.

3084
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:31,250
This goes here.

3085
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:34,310
Oh, God.

3086
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:36,390
What is this?

3087
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:40,560
No!

3088
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:41,560
Wait.

3089
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:49,840
I thought I had a rough day at work, but it's one puzzle.

3090
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,940
I bet the hardy voice would have solved this by now.

3091
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:55,740
You're so right.

3092
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:57,520
Nancy's a stupid woman.

3093
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,860
Of course she can't solve this puzzle.

3094
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:01,700
Wait.

3095
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:02,900
This one also has three.

3096
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:02,960
Three.

3097
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,120
Okay.

3098
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:04,440
Hold on.

3099
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:05,200
Switch!

3100
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:07,220
No, it doesn't.

3101
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,340
I'm a stupid head.

3102
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:09,220
I can't see.

3103
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,460
That's four.

3104
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:13,480
Okay.

3105
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:14,360
The one and three.

3106
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:19,650
And then...

3107
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:21,810
One, two, three, four, five.

3108
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:24,130
It's connected to a...

3109
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:25,110
One with...

3110
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:26,530
One, two, three, four...

3111
02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:26,890
What?

3112
02:02:27,270 --> 02:02:29,390
I think their game is different than mine.

3113
02:02:29,730 --> 02:02:30,730
What is happening?

3114
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:39,130
But there was only one piece that had three.

3115
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:39,810
Three connections.

3116
02:02:39,990 --> 02:02:40,010
Three connections.

3117
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:40,770
No?

3118
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:42,050
Right?

3119
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:44,410
There was only the one piece.

3120
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:49,800
It was this one.

3121
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:50,880
Right?

3122
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:55,580
Are you able to reset the puzzle?

3123
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:55,960
Nope.

3124
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:59,460
You are not allowed to because the game aids now.

3125
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:03,900
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3126
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,060
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3127
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:07,360
Okay.

3128
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,980
I'm just recreating what they did.

3129
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:12,700
In this...

3130
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:13,340
In this photo.

3131
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:21,380
Okay?

3132
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:23,860
I'm recreating how they did it in this photo.

3133
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:24,140
Okay?

3134
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:24,220
Okay.

3135
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:27,420
What?

3136
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:32,900
What?

3137
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:38,060
Huh?

3138
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:39,020
Huh?

3139
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:39,080
What?

3140
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:42,600
You're not allowed to parce you six minutes?

3141
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,080
Every copy of Nancy Drew Saw is personalized.

3142
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:48,720
Oh, the music is back.

3143
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:53,660
Wait, but this isn't like the picture.

3144
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:09,020
Oh, I thought this was connected to this one.

3145
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,080
I feel... wait.

3146
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:14,220
Ah, one, two, three, four.

3147
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:16,140
One, two, three, four.

3148
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:19,860
And then this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3149
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,060
One, two... one, two, three, four, five, six...

3150
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,580
There has to be another one with three connections.

3151
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:41,920
But I don't see any.

3152
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:45,240
Four...

3153
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:46,760
Four...

3154
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:48,660
Four...

3155
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:50,800
Four...

3156
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:52,920
Four...

3157
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,240
This is the only one with three!

3158
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:58,580
Then why?

3159
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:01,700
In the picture...

3160
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:04,380
Okay, I'm gonna... hold on, let me get the picture up for you guys.

3161
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:06,420
I don't know.

3162
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:09,020
Wait!

3163
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:09,900
Oh, wait.

3164
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:12,640
What if the picture I'm looking at...

3165
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:16,300
Is from the baby...

3166
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:16,840
Detective.

3167
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:18,660
And I'm on the senior detective.

3168
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:23,140
I'm no good at these, but my nephew...

3169
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:23,940
See, he loves them.

3170
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:25,260
I'm gonna get some chili.

3171
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,620
Oh, one more thing!

3172
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:41,460
Senior...

3173
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:47,840
Oh my gosh, I can't find... I can't find anywhere that...

3174
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:48,200
Wait!

3175
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:51,940
Oh!

3176
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:53,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3177
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:54,700
Just a minute!

3178
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,500
Okay, I might've... I might've...

3179
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:58,960
I might've...

3180
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,140
I might've...

3181
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:00,360
I might've...

3182
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:00,580
I might've...

3183
02:06:00,580 --> 02:06:01,900
I might've found a solution!

3184
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:03,200
Okay, let's try this one.

3185
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:04,880
No one played senior.

3186
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:06,060
They all knew better!

3187
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:07,120
They were like...

3188
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:09,040
They all knew about this puzzle!

3189
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:15,240
They all knew about this puzzle and was like hell no I'm not doing that.

3190
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:20,680
They saved themselves!

3191
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:22,500
Okay, hold on.

3192
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:31,450
Like that, maybe.

3193
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:36,990
And... No, no, no.

3194
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:47,600
So, anybody, don't use this as a walkthrough.

3195
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:52,740
Oh my god!

3196
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:55,500
I can't believe this is so stupid.

3197
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:58,680
Okay, okay.

3198
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:06,140
What?

3199
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:13,620
The seniors are too old to post a guide.

3200
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:17,340
Speed run.

3201
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,600
Speed run.

3202
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:20,560
Hold on, hold on.

3203
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:25,500
Oh wait, is this... Hold on.

3204
02:07:32,030 --> 02:07:32,550
Origami?

3205
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:33,810
There's origami too?

3206
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:36,450
Maybe we can come back to this.

3207
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:40,090
Holy... Oh yeah.

3208
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:41,070
How long?

3209
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:41,910
The wires?

3210
02:07:44,290 --> 02:07:46,190
Takes this person only ten minutes.

3211
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:47,690
You mother trucker.

3212
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:50,690
How do you do it in ten minutes?

3213
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:52,910
Okay, hold on.

3214
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:03,090
There are other puzzles we can do in the meantime.

3215
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:03,770
You know what?

3216
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:05,130
Let's just do that.

3217
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:06,330
Let's take a break, everybody.

3218
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:07,970
Let's take a break.

3219
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:09,670
We gotta go find grandma.

3220
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:10,910
She's somewhere around here.

3221
02:08:10,910 --> 02:08:10,990
Where?

3222
02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:13,570
I just don't know where.

3223
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:16,270
Oh, maybe in here.

3224
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:17,590
Oh, no.

3225
02:08:17,650 --> 02:08:18,110
That's a hallway.

3226
02:08:19,670 --> 02:08:20,210
Oh my god.

3227
02:08:20,330 --> 02:08:20,690
Game, please.

3228
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:21,310
I'm scared.

3229
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:26,390
Wait.

3230
02:08:26,430 --> 02:08:26,430
Wait.

3231
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:26,930
Oh.

3232
02:08:28,770 --> 02:08:29,410
Turn around.

3233
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:33,440
Grandma!

3234
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:37,600
I understand why that guy was going crazy.

3235
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:44,920
So this is a hallway.

3236
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:48,520
And this is rooms.

3237
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:49,920
Are they all rooms?

3238
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,660
I need a key to open this door.

3239
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:52,480
Locked.

3240
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,260
Locked.

3241
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:53,560
Okay.

3242
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,220
These are all bedrooms.

3243
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:57,540
I feel like I've gone down...

3244
02:08:57,540 --> 02:08:58,380
This is a hallway.

3245
02:08:58,960 --> 02:08:59,280
Yes.

3246
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:07,300
Maybe this is a hallway.

3247
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:16,610
I think if that guy is a literal...

3248
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:20,130
Robotics engineer, he should be able to solve it.

3249
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:21,270
I'm just saying.

3250
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:25,290
I'm just saying.

3251
02:09:25,450 --> 02:09:26,850
It should not be on Nancy Drew.

3252
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:28,770
A.K.A.

3253
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:28,990
me.

3254
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:31,210
Where is grandma?

3255
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:46,480
I'm watching this walkthrough.

3256
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:47,700
Oh!

3257
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:49,020
Okay, okay, okay.

3258
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:55,800
That gave me a literal stomach ache, you guys.

3259
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:56,960
I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

3260
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:57,500
I'm sorry.

3261
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,320
I'll be right back.

3262
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:25,990
Okay.

3263
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:27,070
Okay, okay.

3264
02:12:27,710 --> 02:12:28,070
Alright.

3265
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:29,070
Sorry about that.

3266
02:12:29,070 --> 02:12:30,610
I wanted to go get some more water.

3267
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:33,450
So grandma should be...

3268
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:34,210
Right here!

3269
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:36,770
Hello?

3270
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:37,530
Locked.

3271
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:39,030
Is it too late?

3272
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:40,390
Grandma?

3273
02:12:40,650 --> 02:12:42,290
I need a key to open this door.

3274
02:12:42,490 --> 02:12:43,790
But my cultural...

3275
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:44,550
Experience!

3276
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:46,070
Locked.

3277
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:51,290
Welcome back.

3278
02:12:51,570 --> 02:12:51,590
Welcome back.

3279
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:52,030
Okaeri.

3280
02:12:52,290 --> 02:12:52,810
Tadai Ma!

3281
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:58,020
Can use the clock on the phone.

3282
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,020
Oh, it's almost at midnight.

3283
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:00,520
Wow.

3284
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:03,680
We spent so much time traveling to Pachinko.

3285
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:06,880
Um...

3286
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:10,180
What time did it say it was open?

3287
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:15,180
7 a.m.

3288
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,760
Alright, let's set an alarm for 7 a.m., baby.

3289
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:22,780
Looking up untangling plan or graphs.

3290
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:26,380
There's some web versions called Planarity that are free to play.

3291
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:29,100
I don't want to go through all of that, though.

3292
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:32,980
I don't want to go through all of that.

3293
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:33,920
Okay, clock.

3294
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,220
7 a.m.

3295
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:41,520
I think I'll sleep somewhere more reasonable.

3296
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:43,000
What do you mean, sleep?

3297
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:44,140
Nancy Drew.

3298
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:45,900
This is...

3299
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:47,540
You're pulling an all-nighter, girlfriend.

3300
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:49,800
Here we go.

3301
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:50,960
Back to the...

3302
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,140
Back to hell.

3303
02:13:56,930 --> 02:13:58,710
Grandma said finish your puzzle.

3304
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:00,130
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3305
02:14:00,850 --> 02:14:02,030
Finish your puzzle.

3306
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:07,640
Okay, hold on.

3307
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:08,980
I'm going back to my tutorial.

3308
02:14:18,010 --> 02:14:18,490
Uh...

3309
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:24,250
The person, even in the tutorial, is like...

3310
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:25,150
Kinda, like...

3311
02:14:25,150 --> 02:14:25,610
They don't know.

3312
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:33,180
I'm scat...

3313
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:33,500
I'm scat...

3314
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:33,840
Ah!

3315
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:34,280
Ah!

3316
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:34,660
Ah!

3317
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:35,820
Is that it?

3318
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:36,840
That's it!

3319
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:37,180
Okay.

3320
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:37,760
Alright.

3321
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:39,360
Okay.

3322
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:41,280
Okay!

3323
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:42,140
Okay!

3324
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:43,180
Think they look fun.

3325
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:44,500
Good luck, everybody else.

3326
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:46,560
You can all have fun with your little puzzle.

3327
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:47,680
I...

3328
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:48,940
I have no interest.

3329
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:51,560
I will never touch this again.

3330
02:14:52,060 --> 02:14:52,260
I...

3331
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:54,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3332
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,620
I never want to see this.

3333
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,180
I never...

3334
02:14:58,180 --> 02:14:58,920
Ha ha ha ha.

3335
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:02,120
I never want to see it again.

3336
02:15:02,620 --> 02:15:03,120
Okay.

3337
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:05,400
Well, this is gonna be a doozy.

3338
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:05,680
Okay.

3339
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:08,180
So we'll start with our three-pronged one.

3340
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:10,870
Which they have...

3341
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:13,700
Uh...

3342
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:16,980
Right here.

3343
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:22,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3344
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:27,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

3345
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:28,360
Wait.

3346
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,160
Let me make sure.

3347
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:30,500
Okay.

3348
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:31,760
That one goes down here.

3349
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:36,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

3350
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:39,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3351
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:39,960
Okay.

3352
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:41,560
This is our three-three prog.

3353
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:42,540
This is our three connection.

3354
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:43,820
So then...

3355
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:44,500
Then...

3356
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:45,280
Then...

3357
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:46,100
This one goes here.

3358
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:50,020
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3359
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:53,360
Three...

3360
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:55,060
Four, five, six, seven.

3361
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:56,220
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

3362
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:56,540
Okay.

3363
02:15:57,200 --> 02:15:59,660
Just follow along, everybody, for now.

3364
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:01,380
Follow along for now.

3365
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:03,540
And then, Neil, go here.

3366
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:05,300
Okay, follow along for now.

3367
02:16:05,620 --> 02:16:06,500
Are you guys following?

3368
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:08,600
Are you guys following along for now?

3369
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:09,640
Okay.

3370
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:11,500
Are you guys following?

3371
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:22,980
I don't... This... It's not easy for me, okay?

3372
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:26,000
If it's easy for you, that's so wonderful for you.

3373
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:28,060
It's not easy for me.

3374
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:29,080
So...

3375
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:46,740
And I don't think it's a very easy thing to describe in text, so, um... Okay, um... One, two, three.

3376
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:48,540
Maybe, like, here.

3377
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:49,620
Right?

3378
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:54,640
Okay, the one that connects, so this... No, because this needs... Uh, shoot.

3379
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:58,580
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3380
02:16:59,060 --> 02:17:01,460
Where's our other seven... seven connection?

3381
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:02,920
This one?

3382
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:03,780
Maybe, no.

3383
02:17:05,060 --> 02:17:05,640
Uh, oh.

3384
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,160
One, two, three, four, five, no.

3385
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:12,540
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

3386
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:16,320
I'm throwing you over here.

3387
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:17,240
Oh, see, see, see, see?

3388
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:18,620
See, see, see, see, see?

3389
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:24,760
Remember, any wists that want to make a fangame for Minto, please don't.

3390
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:29,280
Please don't!

3391
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:32,040
Do you hate me?

3392
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:36,960
Oh, Minto, she's so cute when she's dumb.

3393
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:44,360
She's so cute when she doesn't know how to get out.

3394
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:53,860
One, two, three, four, five.

3395
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:54,960
One, two...

3396
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,400
Three, four, five.

3397
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:00,180
Okay, so I think this one goes here.

3398
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:02,260
Mm-hmm.

3399
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:05,700
And we're gonna have a one, two, three, four...

3400
02:18:06,380 --> 02:18:07,040
Up here.

3401
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:07,660
It could be...

3402
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:09,040
It could be any of these, though.

3403
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:09,480
I don't know.

3404
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:17,820
Please make Minto P-Cross instead of whatever this thing...

3405
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:18,140
Yeah!

3406
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:20,400
Make a P-Cross, make a nonogram.

3407
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:22,200
I will do that so much.

3408
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:23,920
Okay.

3409
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:24,860
Okay.

3410
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:25,960
All right.

3411
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:28,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3412
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:32,120
I accidentally took it out of full screen.

3413
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:32,480
Okay.

3414
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:36,650
Mm-hmm.

3415
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:39,150
Mm-mm.

3416
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:40,970
I feel like...

3417
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:45,350
What I had is almost close to what they have.

3418
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:51,360
So maybe I really was a genius after all.

3419
02:18:56,820 --> 02:18:59,220
Maybe I was a genius after all.

3420
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:00,820
Wait a second.

3421
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:02,340
What the hell?

3422
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:03,600
I don't know.

3423
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,440
I'm just kind of moving some things around.

3424
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,420
It seems a little random right now.

3425
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:08,520
Because it is.

3426
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:17,140
One, two, three, four.

3427
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:18,700
One, two...

3428
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:18,820
Wait.

3429
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:36,440
The whole right side looks great.

3430
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:37,160
Yeah!

3431
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:38,740
Yeah, it does.

3432
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:41,960
But I'm lost now.

3433
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:50,750
Let's start from our roots.

3434
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:56,090
Like this.

3435
02:19:56,290 --> 02:19:57,550
This I know is for sure.

3436
02:19:57,850 --> 02:20:00,210
And then this one I think goes like here-ish.

3437
02:20:01,350 --> 02:20:01,590
Oh.

3438
02:20:02,190 --> 02:20:03,470
This will move out.

3439
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:05,590
So this...

3440
02:20:05,590 --> 02:20:06,630
Is here.

3441
02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:09,950
Wait a second.

3442
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:10,910
Oh, there's one...

3443
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:13,510
Maybe this goes here.

3444
02:20:13,630 --> 02:20:13,930
Ah!

3445
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:14,690
Ah!

3446
02:20:15,570 --> 02:20:16,610
I think so.

3447
02:20:16,710 --> 02:20:17,230
I think so.

3448
02:20:17,770 --> 02:20:18,550
I think so.

3449
02:20:18,670 --> 02:20:19,170
I think so.

3450
02:20:19,570 --> 02:20:20,910
And then...

3451
02:20:20,910 --> 02:20:23,570
This one has this maybe go here.

3452
02:20:24,390 --> 02:20:24,530
Oh!

3453
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:27,350
Oh!

3454
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:27,870
Oh!

3455
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:40,890
This one is supposed to have...

3456
02:20:40,890 --> 02:20:41,870
One, two, three, four.

3457
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:42,950
Maybe this goes here.

3458
02:20:43,070 --> 02:20:44,550
I got the backing off the portrait.

3459
02:20:44,870 --> 02:20:45,870
Nice job.

3460
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,980
I got the backing off the portrait.

3461
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:53,680
Nice job.

3462
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:54,860
That's it?

3463
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,660
Certificate of spirit removal.

3464
02:20:59,040 --> 02:20:59,800
What's this?

3465
02:21:04,710 --> 02:21:05,890
I'm sorry.

3466
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:08,330
Konnichiwa.

3467
02:21:08,670 --> 02:21:10,150
Certificate of spirit removal.

3468
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:11,710
This is the...

3469
02:21:11,710 --> 02:21:13,110
Puzzle Master Rita.

3470
02:21:13,690 --> 02:21:14,430
Woo-hoo, Rita!

3471
02:21:16,610 --> 02:21:17,810
Thank you!

3472
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:20,570
First try.

3473
02:21:20,910 --> 02:21:21,070
Yeah!

3474
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:24,860
Wow!

3475
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:26,060
Thank you so much.

3476
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:27,180
Teal.

3477
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:28,720
Thank you, thank you for the...

3478
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:29,760
Thank you, thank you for the...

3479
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:30,000
Thank you.

3480
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:30,440
First try.

3481
02:21:30,700 --> 02:21:30,820
Yeah.

3482
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:32,520
Thank you, thank you for the...

3483
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:33,260
Thank you, thank you.

3484
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:44,140
This is to certify that Relkan Hiei has been cleansed of all malevolent, disruptive, or mischievous spirits, and upon this day is considered fit for human habitation.

3485
02:21:44,620 --> 02:21:48,820
Special attention has been paid to all spaces under beds and within closets.

3486
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:54,740
These areas have been certified 100% permanently ghost-free, even during the middle of the night.

3487
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:56,120
Victory!

3488
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:56,920
Yeah!

3489
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:07,960
It has been duly noted and added to the public record that all spirits previously dwelling in said domicile are now considered non-resident and shall behave themselves accordingly.

3490
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:15,960
At no point will the aforementioned spirits, ghosts, or lurking specters be allowed to return to their previous places of residence.

3491
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:25,380
Without the express written provision of all human residents in the residence.

3492
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,040
A-okay!

3493
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:31,400
Signed, Savannah Woodham-sama, paranormal expert.

3494
02:22:38,140 --> 02:22:39,560
Oh, yes.

3495
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:40,780
This is our very...

3496
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:46,320
Japanese exorcism by Savannah-sama.

3497
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:50,320
You guys wouldn't get anything like this.

3498
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:51,240
I mean, it wouldn't work.

3499
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:53,060
But, like, you guys wouldn't do this, right?

3500
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:55,480
That's so silly.

3501
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:55,940
Oh.

3502
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:57,680
I should hold on to this article.

3503
02:22:57,980 --> 02:22:58,500
Oh, god.

3504
02:22:58,840 --> 02:22:59,160
Oh.

3505
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:12,400
I'm, like, tr- Very, very vaguely piecing together- I can't read kanji.

3506
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:17,900
Oh, it's saying, like, it seems like, uh, the daughter...

3507
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:19,860
Uh, found the mom.

3508
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:32,300
Ooh.

3509
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:33,840
That's not good.

3510
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:37,080
Kanji hard.

3511
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:38,500
Wait, how do I...

3512
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:39,380
Um, oh, I took it.

3513
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:40,380
Okay.

3514
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:42,580
That's it?

3515
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:43,700
Hi.

3516
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:47,720
Um, do you know anything about the certificate behind the portrait?

3517
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:50,480
Do you know anything about the certificate behind the portrait?

3518
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,400
Who's Savannah Woodham?

3519
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:55,440
She was an investigator.

3520
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:59,140
She helped out with the investigation after Kasumi died.

3521
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:00,540
An investigator?

3522
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:01,800
An investigator?

3523
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:04,640
This certificate seems a little less than official.

3524
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:05,740
Don't forget to save.

3525
02:24:05,740 --> 02:24:05,780
Oh, thank you, Ava.

3526
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:08,640
She was more of a paranormal investigator.

3527
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:13,100
I don't really believe in that stuff personally, but Takai wanted her here.

3528
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:13,660
Takai.

3529
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:16,220
Why did Takai want a paranormal investigator?

3530
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,040
Takai.

3531
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,720
I've known Takai since I was a kid.

3532
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:19,180
Takai.

3533
02:24:19,180 --> 02:24:21,260
And let me tell you this from experience.

3534
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:26,680
It is impossible to guess what she's thinking or why she doesn't...

3535
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:28,200
What she does.

3536
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:29,940
What do you mean?

3537
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:30,740
Oh.

3538
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:33,240
I'm sure you'll find out.

3539
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:33,820
Oh.

3540
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:35,320
Oh.

3541
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:35,760
Let me save.

3542
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:36,600
So true.

3543
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:37,420
Shadow.

3544
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:39,680
Minto shadow.

3545
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:40,400
Shit.

3546
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,220
Can you translate this for me?

3547
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:44,100
Can you translate this for me?

3548
02:24:44,660 --> 02:24:44,980
Sure.

3549
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:47,700
No.

3550
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,940
Put this back where you got it.

3551
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:52,920
Uh.

3552
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:55,900
I don't think you like that.

3553
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:56,580
Hey.

3554
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:57,400
Oh.

3555
02:24:57,660 --> 02:24:58,840
Do you know what scare- Oh wait.

3556
02:24:58,940 --> 02:25:01,080
Do you know where I can get a card for the pachinko parlor?

3557
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:03,240
Do you know where I can get a card for the pachinko parlor?

3558
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:06,180
It seems like I'm always running into those things.

3559
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:07,740
Guests leave them everywhere.

3560
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:08,380
Oh.

3561
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:09,060
Take a look around.

3562
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:10,420
I'm sure you'll find one.

3563
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:10,760
What?

3564
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:12,280
That's not helpful at all.

3565
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:14,400
It's just like...

3566
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:16,460
Why are all...

3567
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:17,480
I don't...

3568
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:20,400
Is pachinko that common for like tourists to do?

3569
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:22,100
I've never done it before.

3570
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:24,500
Like...

3571
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:26,120
Is it...

3572
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:26,440
Yeah.

3573
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:28,120
Pick up the trash that the...

3574
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:29,260
That the previous residences...

3575
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:30,460
Uh...

3576
02:25:30,460 --> 02:25:31,500
Residents...

3577
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:31,640
Uh...

3578
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:32,340
Guests...

3579
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:33,200
Uh...

3580
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:34,020
Just left here.

3581
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:36,480
I don't know.

3582
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:37,420
Just find one.

3583
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:38,260
Lamal.

3584
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:41,860
Do you know what's scaring the guests away?

3585
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:44,560
Series stu-per-stitions.

3586
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:45,560
Stu-per-stitions.

3587
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:49,080
We have ghost hunters who come here to find ghosts.

3588
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:52,960
And if they think they've found something, they get all panicked and run away.

3589
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:54,680
This guy is so sussy.

3590
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:56,580
I'll let you get back to work.

3591
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:57,620
See you later.

3592
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:58,500
He...

3593
02:25:58,500 --> 02:25:59,880
I feel like he...

3594
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:01,700
Say there's like...

3595
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:02,920
He can build stuff, right?

3596
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:07,640
So I feel like he would be able to build something to make like a cl...

3597
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:10,960
You know, crashing noises or whatever.

3598
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:13,180
I think this guy is sus.

3599
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:14,400
Because...

3600
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:18,280
I'm gonna ask her to translate it because Nancy has no decorum.

3601
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:25,600
And it's almost when I am...

3602
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:25,940
Hi.

3603
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,580
Oh gosh.

3604
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:31,020
It's about...

3605
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:33,060
Is it about her mom?

3606
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:34,040
It's so horrible.

3607
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:35,600
I found an old article.

3608
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:37,140
Can you tell me what it says?

3609
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:38,180
Sure.

3610
02:26:40,700 --> 02:26:42,040
Where did you get this?

3611
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:44,260
You have no right to have this.

3612
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:50,920
The good news, at least it was Miwako who caught you and not some creepy ghost.

3613
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:54,240
Bad news, what you did mean Miwako's still in her room right now?

3614
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:54,880
That can't be!

3615
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:56,060
Wait, what are you talking about?

3616
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:57,740
Oh, oh!

3617
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:02,540
I...

3618
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:03,680
They killed me!

3619
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:04,700
What are

3620
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:14,550
you...

3621
02:27:15,130 --> 02:27:15,590
Um...

3622
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:19,250
I hear this place has a reputation as a destination for ghost hunters.

3623
02:27:19,590 --> 02:27:20,970
We didn't ask for it.

3624
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:22,850
It's all that stupid book.

3625
02:27:23,070 --> 02:27:26,970
Those people, they have no respect for anyone or anything.

3626
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:28,530
Ooh...

3627
02:27:28,530 --> 02:27:32,930
I can't believe we can get a game over this.

3628
02:27:32,990 --> 02:27:33,450
I can't believe we can get a game over this.

3629
02:27:33,570 --> 02:27:35,490
Can you tell me about that?

3630
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:36,030
What?

3631
02:27:36,590 --> 02:27:39,590
That's no offense, but that seems sort of silly.

3632
02:27:39,830 --> 02:27:40,650
A certificate?

3633
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:43,790
So you don't know anything about it?

3634
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:44,430
No.

3635
02:27:44,810 --> 02:27:47,650
And where exactly did you find this certificate?

3636
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:50,410
Behind the portrait I helped Rentaro repair.

3637
02:27:50,830 --> 02:27:53,030
Maybe you should stay away from what isn't yours.

3638
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:57,250
And maybe he should have the sense to know what is a family matter.

3639
02:27:58,010 --> 02:27:59,790
I have to get back to work now.

3640
02:28:00,350 --> 02:28:00,490
Okay!

3641
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:01,650
Damn!

3642
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:04,910
Nancy Drew!

3643
02:28:06,010 --> 02:28:07,570
Your decorum please!

3644
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:10,410
I think it's this side.

3645
02:28:11,930 --> 02:28:12,240
Is...

3646
02:28:12,910 --> 02:28:13,530
Our...

3647
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:14,750
Our room, right?

3648
02:28:15,070 --> 02:28:15,790
Yeah, okay.

3649
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:15,830
Okay.

3650
02:28:16,170 --> 02:28:16,710
Alright.

3651
02:28:17,070 --> 02:28:18,130
Number 24!

3652
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:19,230
This one?

3653
02:28:19,430 --> 02:28:19,970
26.

3654
02:28:20,170 --> 02:28:20,430
Damn it.

3655
02:28:21,210 --> 02:28:21,590
24.

3656
02:28:22,030 --> 02:28:22,310
26.

3657
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:23,470
Uh, 24!

3658
02:28:25,330 --> 02:28:25,870
Oh!

3659
02:28:26,170 --> 02:28:27,510
Our bed has been set up!

3660
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:28,190
Wow!

3661
02:28:30,810 --> 02:28:31,690
Any ghosts?

3662
02:28:38,190 --> 02:28:40,530
How am I supposed to find just a pachinko card?

3663
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:42,550
All the rooms are locked.

3664
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:44,430
Okay.

3665
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:47,290
Uh...

3666
02:28:48,030 --> 02:28:48,470
Uh...

3667
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:49,630
Wait, how do I get to bed?

3668
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:51,370
Turn around.

3669
02:28:51,530 --> 02:28:51,850
There we go.

3670
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:52,270
Alright.

3671
02:28:53,010 --> 02:28:53,930
Wait, uh, turn around.

3672
02:28:55,350 --> 02:28:56,410
We did this.

3673
02:28:56,910 --> 02:28:58,150
We did all of this.

3674
02:28:58,710 --> 02:28:59,430
Go to sleep...

3675
02:28:59,430 --> 02:28:59,670
Oh, wait.

3676
02:28:59,830 --> 02:29:00,390
Uh, let me...

3677
02:29:00,390 --> 02:29:01,710
If I set my alarm now, I think.

3678
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:02,310
It'll work.

3679
02:29:04,270 --> 02:29:04,710
Clock.

3680
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:08,350
7...

3681
02:29:09,070 --> 02:29:09,510
AM.

3682
02:29:11,810 --> 02:29:12,250
Okay.

3683
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:15,290
I'll be busy then.

3684
02:29:15,370 --> 02:29:17,550
I should set the alarm for a later time.

3685
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:18,710
What do you mean busy?

3686
02:29:18,810 --> 02:29:19,290
What are you doing?

3687
02:29:19,530 --> 02:29:20,210
I'll be busy then.

3688
02:29:20,550 --> 02:29:20,930
What are you...

3689
02:29:20,930 --> 02:29:22,170
I'll be teaching then.

3690
02:29:22,370 --> 02:29:23,790
I should set the alarm for...

3691
02:29:23,790 --> 02:29:24,730
I'll be teaching...

3692
02:29:24,730 --> 02:29:25,570
I'll be teaching...

3693
02:29:25,570 --> 02:29:26,610
I'll be teaching then.

3694
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:27,910
I'll be busy then.

3695
02:29:28,090 --> 02:29:29,450
Can't set my alarm for then.

3696
02:29:29,670 --> 02:29:29,990
Oh my god.

3697
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,810
I'll be teaching then.

3698
02:29:30,910 --> 02:29:31,890
I'll be teaching then.

3699
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:33,250
I'll be teaching then.

3700
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:34,850
I'll be teaching then.

3701
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:35,470
I'll be teaching then.

3702
02:29:35,470 --> 02:29:36,490
It's really late.

3703
02:29:36,690 --> 02:29:37,730
I should get to bed.

3704
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:47,470
I'll be teaching, I'll be, I'll be teaching, I'll be, oh my god.

3705
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:53,070
Oh, alarm!

3706
02:29:54,590 --> 02:29:57,250
Let's go make some origami, baby!

3707
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:01,970
Okay.

3708
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:03,330
Oh, whoops, wrong way.

3709
02:30:05,270 --> 02:30:07,410
Okay, origami, origami.

3710
02:30:08,230 --> 02:30:09,710
Origami, origami.

3711
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:12,130
Origami, origami.

3712
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:14,790
My cultural room.

3713
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:18,350
Nanasi-san, please, sit.

3714
02:30:18,470 --> 02:30:19,230
What did you call me?

3715
02:30:19,490 --> 02:30:20,530
Nanasi-san?

3716
02:30:20,690 --> 02:30:21,430
Nanasi?

3717
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:26,230
I am sorry for the way I behaved when you Farast arrived.

3718
02:30:26,670 --> 02:30:27,430
Farast?

3719
02:30:27,730 --> 02:30:29,130
It was very impolite.

3720
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:31,430
Please, forgive me.

3721
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:33,850
Of course, don't worry.

3722
02:30:34,190 --> 02:30:35,830
It's nice to meet you as well.

3723
02:30:36,270 --> 02:30:39,670
That is very kind of you to say.

3724
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:47,030
But I must always worry about the guests who stay with us.

3725
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:47,870
I think she's French.

3726
02:30:48,970 --> 02:30:49,370
From France.

3727
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:50,330
What is this?

3728
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:52,250
What do you mean, especially now?

3729
02:30:52,810 --> 02:30:55,490
Are you here for a lesson today?

3730
02:30:55,870 --> 02:30:57,670
What is this accent?

3731
02:30:59,510 --> 02:31:01,110
The guests.

3732
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:03,310
The guests.

3733
02:31:04,490 --> 02:31:05,850
The guests.

3734
02:31:06,210 --> 02:31:07,990
A lesson?

3735
02:31:08,210 --> 02:31:08,850
A lesson?

3736
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:15,810
I offer lesson in traditional arts to anyone interested in learning.

3737
02:31:16,650 --> 02:31:18,710
I have much to show you.

3738
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:19,390
Oh, okay.

3739
02:31:20,170 --> 02:31:21,870
Actually, I'd rather ask you a few questions.

3740
02:31:22,090 --> 02:31:22,770
Oh, no, we'll do that.

3741
02:31:22,850 --> 02:31:23,450
Sounds great.

3742
02:31:23,690 --> 02:31:24,410
Why are you shaking your head?

3743
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:26,590
Today, you will be learning katakana.

3744
02:31:26,750 --> 02:31:27,090
Oh, no.

3745
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:32,050
To the outsider, katakana always looks far more difficult to learn than it is.

3746
02:31:32,050 --> 02:31:33,630
Wait, we're learning katakana for real?

3747
02:31:33,630 --> 02:31:39,610
You just need to be patient, and you need to learn to see more than you are used to seeing.

3748
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:42,610
There is a book to help in the chest.

3749
02:31:42,810 --> 02:31:44,210
In the chest.

3750
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:44,710
Practice.

3751
02:31:44,730 --> 02:31:44,810
Practice.

3752
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:48,310
Until it looks like your name, Nanatsi.

3753
02:31:48,550 --> 02:31:49,250
Nanatsi.

3754
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:51,110
Not just some lines.

3755
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:52,610
What do you mean?

3756
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:56,630
Although there are many Nanatsis in the world.

3757
02:31:56,670 --> 02:31:57,310
Nanatsis?

3758
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:57,910
What?

3759
02:31:58,130 --> 02:31:59,270
It's getting worse.

3760
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:00,210
Your name belongs to only you.

3761
02:32:00,330 --> 02:32:02,990
It has always been yours.

3762
02:32:02,990 --> 02:32:09,450
You must try until what you see on the paper is not just a word.

3763
02:32:09,870 --> 02:32:11,410
It is you.

3764
02:32:15,790 --> 02:32:16,090
Wait.

3765
02:32:16,850 --> 02:32:18,310
I pick up my pen.

3766
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:20,930
That's not quite right.

3767
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:22,010
What are you talking about?

3768
02:32:22,390 --> 02:32:22,810
What?

3769
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:24,750
How do I get rid of it?

3770
02:32:26,650 --> 02:32:28,410
She already wrote my name.

3771
02:32:28,570 --> 02:32:28,650
Wait.

3772
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:29,170
No, no.

3773
02:32:29,290 --> 02:32:29,530
Grandma.

3774
02:32:30,850 --> 02:32:31,330
Grandma.

3775
02:32:31,330 --> 02:32:31,670
Grandma, please.

3776
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:33,450
Grandma.

3777
02:32:33,850 --> 02:32:34,750
How do I get it?

3778
02:32:36,010 --> 02:32:37,450
Sit back down, Nanatsi.

3779
02:32:39,770 --> 02:32:40,970
Hello, Nanatsi-san.

3780
02:32:41,270 --> 02:32:41,450
Ah!

3781
02:32:41,770 --> 02:32:42,650
She got my name right!

3782
02:32:42,970 --> 02:32:44,070
I'd like to try calligraphy.

3783
02:32:44,090 --> 02:32:45,590
I'd like to try calligraphy again.

3784
02:32:47,770 --> 02:32:48,790
I don't understand.

3785
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:50,930
So, like, big blotch.

3786
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:52,590
Okay.

3787
02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:53,710
Big blotch.

3788
02:32:54,750 --> 02:32:55,370
Okay.

3789
02:32:55,790 --> 02:32:56,610
Big blotch.

3790
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:58,790
Big blotch.

3791
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:03,870
Big blotch.

3792
02:33:03,870 --> 02:33:03,910
Big blotch.

3793
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:04,770
Big blotch.

3794
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:06,270
Why was I wrong before?

3795
02:33:06,850 --> 02:33:06,910
Ugh.

3796
02:33:07,230 --> 02:33:08,130
Not quite.

3797
02:33:08,210 --> 02:33:09,530
Time to try again.

3798
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:10,670
No, Nanatsi!

3799
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:18,550
Who

3800
02:33:22,030 --> 02:33:24,030
needs duolingo when you have Nanatsi, Drew?

3801
02:33:24,890 --> 02:33:25,790
Okay, okay.

3802
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:26,650
In the lines.

3803
02:33:27,910 --> 02:33:28,550
Okay, okay.

3804
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:33,790
What?

3805
02:33:34,370 --> 02:33:36,090
If you just keep practicing, I'll get it.

3806
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:37,950
Nanatsi.

3807
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:39,990
They're so strict.

3808
02:33:41,070 --> 02:33:41,150
No.

3809
02:33:41,150 --> 02:33:42,690
You think too much.

3810
02:33:43,290 --> 02:33:44,130
Just practice.

3811
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:44,990
I'm trying!

3812
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:47,990
You're laughing too hard.

3813
02:33:53,270 --> 02:33:54,450
This is scary.

3814
02:33:54,670 --> 02:33:55,590
What if I do this one first?

3815
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:57,550
Almost.

3816
02:33:57,890 --> 02:33:58,250
Okay.

3817
02:33:58,410 --> 02:33:59,370
So, you have to...

3818
02:33:59,370 --> 02:33:59,450
Okay.

3819
02:34:00,470 --> 02:34:00,710
Okay.

3820
02:34:01,390 --> 02:34:01,910
Slow.

3821
02:34:02,930 --> 02:34:03,490
Okay.

3822
02:34:03,950 --> 02:34:05,750
Indiana Jones, Nanatsi.

3823
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:16,510
Okay.

3824
02:34:16,730 --> 02:34:16,950
All right.

3825
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:17,430
Nice, nice.

3826
02:34:18,610 --> 02:34:19,070
Okay.

3827
02:34:19,710 --> 02:34:20,330
All right.

3828
02:34:20,430 --> 02:34:21,650
This is where we fumbled last time.

3829
02:34:24,090 --> 02:34:24,650
Oh!

3830
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:25,270
Okay!

3831
02:34:27,230 --> 02:34:27,790
Nanatsi!

3832
02:34:29,250 --> 02:34:29,790
Oh!

3833
02:34:31,470 --> 02:34:32,030
Oh!

3834
02:34:32,170 --> 02:34:32,230
Oh, shoot.

3835
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:33,230
Oh, okay.

3836
02:34:33,290 --> 02:34:33,990
That worked.

3837
02:34:36,950 --> 02:34:37,510
Duh!

3838
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:42,940
Please.

3839
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:43,680
Please, God.

3840
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:45,200
Please!

3841
02:34:47,860 --> 02:34:48,420
Please!

3842
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:00,360
The music is not helping.

3843
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:06,560
Yeah!

3844
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:08,760
Very well done, Nancy.

3845
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:13,240
This is the best I've ever seen from a new student.

3846
02:35:13,970 --> 02:35:16,500
I knew you could do this well.

3847
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:24,400
Leave this to dry, and I'll have it brought to your room to remind you of your success.

3848
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:24,960
Success?

3849
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:25,760
Thank you!

3850
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:27,340
Oh, no.

3851
02:35:27,640 --> 02:35:29,800
I think she'll kill me if I ask her...

3852
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:30,120
Hold on.

3853
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:32,380
Save.

3854
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:36,480
Can you translate this article for me?

3855
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:38,760
I'd be happy to, Nancy-san.

3856
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:39,820
I don't think you will be.

3857
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:43,200
Why would you give me this?

3858
02:35:43,460 --> 02:35:45,200
Put it back where it goes.

3859
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:45,900
Now!

3860
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:47,700
Okay, my bad.

3861
02:35:48,380 --> 02:35:48,740
It's fine.

3862
02:35:52,580 --> 02:35:54,180
I love the gardens.

3863
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:55,620
I love the gardens.

3864
02:35:55,860 --> 02:35:56,960
Do you take care of them?

3865
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:58,500
Yes, of course.

3866
02:35:58,780 --> 02:36:03,100
I sleep here, but my home is out there, in the gardens.

3867
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:03,600
Where?

3868
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:06,820
Even when the whole earth is covered in snow.

3869
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:07,140
What?

3870
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:08,820
I am happiest there.

3871
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:10,300
She doesn't actually mean that she...

3872
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:13,880
Waiting for the first flowers to break through the fast.

3873
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,840
Do yourself a favor, Nancy-san.

3874
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:17,900
Nancy-san.

3875
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:21,980
Find a small piece of earth that begs to be made perfect.

3876
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:25,300
And do whatever it asks of you.

3877
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:27,160
You will thank me.

3878
02:36:27,910 --> 02:36:28,240
What?

3879
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:34,140
Find a small piece of earth that begs to be made perfect.

3880
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:38,040
And do whatever it asks of you.

3881
02:36:41,870 --> 02:36:42,430
What?

3882
02:36:43,630 --> 02:36:45,330
The ryokan seems very important to you.

3883
02:36:45,330 --> 02:36:47,530
The ryokan seems very important to you.

3884
02:36:48,030 --> 02:36:53,390
The world around has become a million different things since I was a girl.

3885
02:36:54,030 --> 02:36:54,250
Gar.

3886
02:36:54,450 --> 02:36:56,170
And I do not have to tell you...

3887
02:36:56,170 --> 02:36:56,690
Since I was a gar.

3888
02:36:56,690 --> 02:37:00,390
That many changes have not been so good.

3889
02:37:01,310 --> 02:37:05,070
But in here, the world does not change.

3890
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:06,210
The world does not change.

3891
02:37:06,210 --> 02:37:08,410
Why do you want Yumi to take over the ryokan?

3892
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:09,960
It is tradition.

3893
02:37:10,830 --> 02:37:12,450
Any other reason?

3894
02:37:12,770 --> 02:37:14,750
I am used to this question.

3895
02:37:15,490 --> 02:37:19,150
Tradition is very often made fun of or ignored.

3896
02:37:19,150 --> 02:37:20,770
Is that why we don't?

3897
02:37:20,770 --> 02:37:24,010
The tradition is how we know ourselves, Nancy-san.

3898
02:37:24,830 --> 02:37:28,810
The traditions of your family are how you know yourself.

3899
02:37:30,010 --> 02:37:32,590
Tradition is a burden in many ways.

3900
02:37:32,910 --> 02:37:33,490
Grandma's yapping.

3901
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:34,670
I understand this.

3902
02:37:34,810 --> 02:37:35,990
She talks so slowly.

3903
02:37:36,330 --> 02:37:41,090
But imagine not knowing who you are or where you come from.

3904
02:37:41,430 --> 02:37:44,430
It would be very lonely, I think.

3905
02:37:46,510 --> 02:37:48,070
She's dodging the question.

3906
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:58,790
What if it's the girl at the reception and her boyfriend conspiring together because she wants to own the ryokan?

3907
02:37:59,410 --> 02:38:00,550
I looked up the cast list.

3908
02:38:00,670 --> 02:38:03,650
Only Miwako's voice actress is Japanese.

3909
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:05,970
I see.

3910
02:38:07,350 --> 02:38:08,710
We fixed the portrait.

3911
02:38:08,990 --> 02:38:10,550
I think it's back up in the lobby.

3912
02:38:11,210 --> 02:38:11,790
It is.

3913
02:38:12,010 --> 02:38:12,390
Yes.

3914
02:38:13,110 --> 02:38:15,810
Rantaro tells me that it's very important to you.

3915
02:38:15,810 --> 02:38:16,690
Yes.

3916
02:38:17,050 --> 02:38:20,150
It is very important to all of us.

3917
02:38:20,470 --> 02:38:22,730
Why were you so upset when it fell?

3918
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:23,970
Because it's important to them.

3919
02:38:24,010 --> 02:38:26,090
You would be upset if something new broke.

3920
02:38:26,810 --> 02:38:27,130
Yeah.

3921
02:38:27,410 --> 02:38:28,990
There was more to it than that.

3922
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:29,610
No.

3923
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:31,390
That was all.

3924
02:38:32,510 --> 02:38:34,410
They want to make it into a different type of ryokan.

3925
02:38:34,510 --> 02:38:34,890
Yeah, yeah.

3926
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:36,410
Maybe she wants to take it over.

3927
02:38:36,730 --> 02:38:40,150
And like, the sister wants to make it, keep it traditional.

3928
02:38:40,410 --> 02:38:42,390
And the other girl is just like, duh.

3929
02:38:43,110 --> 02:38:44,550
I want to make it new.

3930
02:38:44,770 --> 02:38:47,110
Because she's discovered her mom or whatever.

3931
02:38:47,310 --> 02:38:49,170
So she's like, I don't know.

3932
02:38:49,170 --> 02:38:51,310
Have you always lived at the ryokan?

3933
02:38:51,750 --> 02:38:52,130
Ryokan.

3934
02:38:52,130 --> 02:38:53,150
Since I was born.

3935
02:38:53,750 --> 02:38:54,770
Have you ever left?

3936
02:38:55,410 --> 02:38:55,850
I have.

3937
02:38:55,930 --> 02:38:56,150
Damn.

3938
02:38:56,910 --> 02:39:01,790
But I never found anywhere I wanted to be as much as here.

3939
02:39:01,850 --> 02:39:03,170
Robot cat maids!

3940
02:39:03,350 --> 02:39:04,250
Let her take it.

3941
02:39:04,890 --> 02:39:06,490
Have you always offered classes?

3942
02:39:07,070 --> 02:39:07,370
No.

3943
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:08,530
It is new.

3944
02:39:08,990 --> 02:39:11,730
We have developed a reputation.

3945
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:15,650
And for many years, I've wanted to teach our guests.

3946
02:39:15,650 --> 02:39:18,630
I think you need to be less strict.

3947
02:39:20,610 --> 02:39:21,650
I come here.

3948
02:39:21,930 --> 02:39:22,410
I come...

3949
02:39:22,410 --> 02:39:23,190
Why are her eyes...

3950
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:25,330
Did you see her eyes just dart just then?

3951
02:39:30,010 --> 02:39:33,410
She was just like...

3952
02:39:33,410 --> 02:39:35,310
Oh, they're just there.

3953
02:39:36,450 --> 02:39:36,990
Grandma.

3954
02:39:38,330 --> 02:39:39,750
Don't smile at me.

3955
02:39:40,190 --> 02:39:41,730
You're so strict, Grandma.

3956
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:45,510
I just tried to write my name and you had me do it 50 times.

3957
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:46,150
I'll let you go.

3958
02:39:46,430 --> 02:39:46,990
Goodbye.

3959
02:39:48,010 --> 02:39:48,570
Shifty.

3960
02:39:49,470 --> 02:39:50,030
Nancy.

3961
02:39:51,430 --> 02:39:51,650
Nancy.

3962
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:59,110
Okay.

3963
02:39:59,110 --> 02:39:59,890
What time is it?

3964
02:40:00,370 --> 02:40:01,090
7.10.

3965
02:40:01,370 --> 02:40:01,630
Wow.

3966
02:40:03,250 --> 02:40:05,010
That took us 10 minutes, guys.

3967
02:40:05,390 --> 02:40:05,970
What's this?

3968
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:08,150
I'm being nosy.

3969
02:40:08,290 --> 02:40:08,850
Nosy Nancy.

3970
02:40:09,210 --> 02:40:09,310
Oh!

3971
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:10,690
Writing Japanese.

3972
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:13,090
Learn the difference between hiragana and katakana.

3973
02:40:13,550 --> 02:40:14,330
Oh, boy.

3974
02:40:14,570 --> 02:40:14,690
Wait.

3975
02:40:14,730 --> 02:40:15,530
This is an actual...

3976
02:40:15,530 --> 02:40:16,330
Oh, wow!

3977
02:40:30,010 --> 02:40:32,070
And katakana too.

3978
02:40:34,790 --> 02:40:35,870
Wow!

3979
02:40:38,330 --> 02:40:40,950
Writing the Japanese languages...

3980
02:40:40,950 --> 02:40:41,590
Languages?

3981
02:40:42,030 --> 02:40:45,110
Does it count as a different language?

3982
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:48,150
Involves the use of two separate syllabaries.

3983
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:50,550
Hiragana and katakana.

3984
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:53,310
Consisting of 46 symbols in both syllabaries.

3985
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:54,470
Sil...

3986
02:40:54,470 --> 02:40:54,830
Sil...

3987
02:40:54,830 --> 02:40:55,890
Sil...

3988
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:56,310
La...

3989
02:40:59,110 --> 02:40:59,870
La...

3990
02:40:59,870 --> 02:41:04,010
Each character represents a complete syllable instead of a single letter.

3991
02:41:04,010 --> 02:41:06,070
The hiragana syllabary...

3992
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:09,790
Sorry.

3993
02:41:10,030 --> 02:41:15,010
Is mainly used for word endings while katakana is mainly used to write foreign loan words and names.

3994
02:41:15,230 --> 02:41:15,670
Oh, oh, oh.

3995
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:21,590
In addition to hiragana and katakana, a third group of characters known as kanji are also used.

3996
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:25,970
In kanji, each character represents a different meaning and there are thousands of these characters.

3997
02:41:25,970 --> 02:41:33,910
It is a lengthy undertaking and elementary students are given until the end of sixth grade to learn the 1006 basic characters.

3998
02:41:34,210 --> 02:41:38,570
The following charts contain the characters for both the hiragana and katakana syllabaries.

3999
02:41:38,570 --> 02:41:45,670
Japanese is typically written vertically, from right to left, but can also be written horizontally, left to right.

4000
02:41:49,330 --> 02:41:49,650
Okay.

4001
02:41:49,930 --> 02:41:51,190
Everybody learn right now.

4002
02:41:54,070 --> 02:41:56,030
Here's the most important ones.

4003
02:41:57,090 --> 02:41:57,730
Mi...

4004
02:41:58,330 --> 02:41:59,730
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...

4005
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:07,100
Minto.

4006
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:17,560
Or katakana.

4007
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:37,940
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi Is that the thing that I want?

4008
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:44,290
Mito!

4009
02:42:50,140 --> 02:42:51,260
Wait, put it back.

4010
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:52,760
Oh, sorry.

4011
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:53,060
Wait.

4012
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:54,240
Oh, there we go.

4013
02:42:55,940 --> 02:42:56,940
What should I write?

4014
02:42:57,400 --> 02:43:02,460
Oh my gosh, I'm going to be like one of those streamers that's like, Give me your name and I'll write it in Japanese.

4015
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:05,700
Oh, yeah.

4016
02:43:06,660 --> 02:43:08,980
Give me your name and I'll write it in Japanese.

4017
02:43:08,980 --> 02:43:09,320
Yes.

4018
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:12,940
Don't make fun of my stroke order though.

4019
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:14,540
Oppai!

4020
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:15,280
Oh, good one.

4021
02:43:24,730 --> 02:43:25,270
Oppai.

4022
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:25,810
Oppai.

4023
02:43:30,170 --> 02:43:30,710
Suki.

4024
02:43:33,130 --> 02:43:34,030
Oppai suki.

4025
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:48,440
Sorry, it's a little lumpy.

4026
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:51,740
That's my face when I see oppai.

4027
02:43:59,440 --> 02:44:00,720
What else should I write?

4028
02:44:04,640 --> 02:44:06,220
Oh, here's a good one.

4029
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:09,800
Ta-y...

4030
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:11,700
Ga...

4031
02:44:13,320 --> 02:44:13,880
Ga...

4032
02:44:13,880 --> 02:44:15,220
Fa-y...

4033
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:16,880
I-y...

4034
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:18,220
I-y...

4035
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:20,540
Ta-y-gah-fai-ya...

4036
02:44:21,740 --> 02:44:24,400
Ta-y-ga-fai-ya-sai-i-ma-fai-ma-daimama-ma-ma-ma.

4037
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:28,460
Imagine some American girl walks into your ryokan and starts writing Oppai suki.

4038
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:29,620
In Perfect Kata-kana.

4039
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:38,460
What else?

4040
02:44:39,980 --> 02:44:40,080
What else?

4041
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:41,020
Five wiper!

4042
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:43,340
Oh!

4043
02:44:44,420 --> 02:44:45,720
Me...

4044
02:44:47,300 --> 02:44:48,080
Taaru...

4045
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:52,880
Geah.

4046
02:44:56,480 --> 02:44:57,180
Suki?

4047
02:44:57,180 --> 02:45:01,480
What kind of question?

4048
02:45:02,140 --> 02:45:06,960
As long as it says, I'm so sorry for this.

4049
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:11,960
I want to say...

4050
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:12,840
Oh...

4051
02:45:13,940 --> 02:45:15,160
Snake...

4052
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:15,940
...

4053
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:18,780
...

4054
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:23,980
Snake...

4055
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:27,300
...

4056
02:45:42,890 --> 02:45:44,830
Did you know Kai's is part Japanese?

4057
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:45,990
What?

4058
02:45:46,550 --> 02:45:48,010
That guy is part Japanese?

4059
02:45:48,490 --> 02:45:48,970
Wow.

4060
02:45:50,050 --> 02:45:50,650
Wow.

4061
02:45:51,310 --> 02:45:51,970
Here, I'll draw.

4062
02:46:01,180 --> 02:46:05,500
I feel so like... With the music.

4063
02:46:35,980 --> 02:46:36,520
Creature.

4064
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:43,420
Creature.

4065
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:45,780
That's its other foot.

4066
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:46,700
Don't get it twisted.

4067
02:46:51,100 --> 02:46:53,520
That's a lot of strokes for one freaky character.

4068
02:47:02,340 --> 02:47:04,000
You're shuffling on the ground.

4069
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:05,420
Like a...

4070
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:06,260
Like a little bug.

4071
02:47:16,020 --> 02:47:16,900
Just like that.

4072
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:17,500
That's the sound.

4073
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:22,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4074
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:25,340
That's some impeccable brushwork boss.

4075
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:26,360
Thank you.

4076
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:28,020
What can I write?

4077
02:47:31,220 --> 02:47:33,120
Click the guy from Fate.

4078
02:47:55,760 --> 02:47:57,000
La Freak.

4079
02:47:59,100 --> 02:47:59,940
Alright.

4080
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:01,940
Let's save.

4081
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:05,620
What time is it now, Nancy?

4082
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:06,460
Holy!

4083
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:08,460
We've been drawing for 30 minutes!

4084
02:48:10,340 --> 02:48:12,300
Wait to write yaoi right now.

4085
02:48:12,500 --> 02:48:12,800
Why?

4086
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:14,680
Why?

4087
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:17,700
Oh, got nothing in here.

4088
02:48:18,820 --> 02:48:20,080
Gosh, I'm so nosy!

4089
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:22,720
These are not my closets.

4090
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:24,940
Um, where are we going to?

4091
02:48:26,820 --> 02:48:27,960
Uh, maybe here?

4092
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:28,960
Hello!

4093
02:48:30,900 --> 02:48:32,980
Can you tell me anything about Takai?

4094
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:35,300
Can you tell me anything about Takai?

4095
02:48:35,500 --> 02:48:35,960
Takai?

4096
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:37,200
She can be a little tough.

4097
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:38,920
But she's really wonderful.

4098
02:48:39,360 --> 02:48:41,820
She works herself way too hard, though.

4099
02:48:42,380 --> 02:48:45,180
I wish I could get her to just relax a little.

4100
02:48:45,640 --> 02:48:49,660
But you can't tell her to do anything unless you want a lecture back in return.

4101
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:52,780
I take it you've been lectured by Takai before.

4102
02:48:52,780 --> 02:48:55,020
I pretty much grew up here.

4103
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:59,740
And believe it or not, I was not always the saint you see standing before you.

4104
02:48:59,740 --> 02:49:00,580
Wait, so he's a childhood friend?

4105
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:01,400
So...

4106
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:03,120
What do you mean you weren't the saint?

4107
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:05,240
I've been on the sad end of a lecture or two.

4108
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:07,260
But I've overheard more.

4109
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:10,400
Always hilarious when they're not directed at you.

4110
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:16,720
What do you mean- What troubles have you been into, Rentaro?

4111
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:19,700
I'll talk to you later.

4112
02:49:19,960 --> 02:49:20,260
Peace out.

4113
02:49:20,260 --> 02:49:22,440
What do you mean the saint that you see here?

4114
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:22,780
What?

4115
02:49:23,060 --> 02:49:24,520
What is he talking about?

4116
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:27,740
What does he mean by that?

4117
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:31,620
Let's go talk to her, I suppose.

4118
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:36,960
Sush.

4119
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:39,420
I wonder if we can wait until like- Hello?

4120
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:43,220
Until like 1am or whatever?

4121
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:47,320
And then she won't be here and we can talk- We can see behind here, you know?

4122
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:49,440
Do you think that the Ria Khan is haunted?

4123
02:49:49,660 --> 02:49:50,200
By what?

4124
02:49:50,500 --> 02:49:50,980
Ghosts?

4125
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:52,340
No.

4126
02:49:52,340 --> 02:49:53,520
Ghosts aren't real, Nancy.

4127
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:04,000
Your next is Miwako's computer when she's not there.

4128
02:50:04,100 --> 02:50:05,140
Ah, si, si, si!

4129
02:50:05,460 --> 02:50:06,120
I'll let you go.

4130
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:07,460
I guessed it, I guessed it.

4131
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:10,620
Hehehe.

4132
02:50:12,180 --> 02:50:14,800
Um, maybe then, what should we do?

4133
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:15,220
Oh.

4134
02:50:15,920 --> 02:50:19,560
I wonder if we can try and find a card, I guess.

4135
02:50:19,980 --> 02:50:20,340
Wait.

4136
02:50:20,560 --> 02:50:21,140
I wonder.

4137
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:23,180
If the bathrooms aren't right.

4138
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:24,160
Oh, they're for women!

4139
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:25,200
We can go!

4140
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:29,120
We can go to the- We can go to the- We can go to the- Let's see.

4141
02:50:30,020 --> 02:50:30,500
Oh.

4142
02:50:30,760 --> 02:50:31,480
Oh my god.

4143
02:50:31,540 --> 02:50:32,220
That scared me.

4144
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:35,120
Oh.

4145
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:35,520
Oh, Nancy?

4146
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:36,420
Oh!

4147
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:43,900
Oh!

4148
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:44,080
Oh my god!

4149
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:44,880
That's so scary!

4150
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:46,860
What?!

4151
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:47,580
Oh!

4152
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:48,460
Oh!

4153
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:49,040
Oh!

4154
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:49,760
Oh!

4155
02:51:00,420 --> 02:51:01,280
Oh!

4156
02:51:07,420 --> 02:51:08,280
Oh!

4157
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:11,080
What the... What the hell was that?

4158
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:16,900
Scary!

4159
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:18,340
Ouch, ouch!

4160
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:19,160
What?

4161
02:51:25,300 --> 02:51:25,780
What?

4162
02:51:33,660 --> 02:51:35,720
I have Lentalo take care of it right away.

4163
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:38,020
Until then, please stay away.

4164
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:39,480
I don't want you to get hurt.

4165
02:51:39,480 --> 02:51:41,220
But I saw something.

4166
02:51:41,440 --> 02:51:42,380
I'm sure of it.

4167
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:44,240
You work too hard, Nancy-san.

4168
02:51:44,520 --> 02:51:46,500
Up too late, off to teach so early.

4169
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:47,740
You must rest more.

4170
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,460
Your judgment suffers if you do not get enough rest.

4171
02:51:50,700 --> 02:51:51,320
Reflectionless vampire, right?

4172
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:52,300
I know what I saw.

4173
02:51:52,840 --> 02:51:54,220
Nancy-san, please.

4174
02:51:54,660 --> 02:51:57,160
I have to ask you to let me get back to work.

4175
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:01,920
Um... What?

4176
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:04,600
This music is crazy.

4177
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:05,520
What is happening?

4178
02:52:05,700 --> 02:52:06,320
Wait, let me go back.

4179
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:07,360
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

4180
02:52:07,700 --> 02:52:08,460
Let me go back!

4181
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:11,220
I think I have to go up and then turn around.

4182
02:52:11,820 --> 02:52:11,980
Maybe?

4183
02:52:12,220 --> 02:52:12,640
There we go.

4184
02:52:12,780 --> 02:52:12,900
Okay.

4185
02:52:14,120 --> 02:52:15,480
I want to go back to the hot springs.

4186
02:52:17,620 --> 02:52:19,560
That was so freaky, you guys!

4187
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:25,970
That was so stinking scary!

4188
02:52:28,150 --> 02:52:29,010
What the hell?

4189
02:52:29,130 --> 02:52:29,450
Oh!

4190
02:52:29,610 --> 02:52:30,550
This looks important.

4191
02:52:30,870 --> 02:52:32,690
I should figure out where I can use it.

4192
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:33,110
Yeah!

4193
02:52:33,410 --> 02:52:34,670
We got the pachinko card!

4194
02:52:35,610 --> 02:52:36,250
Let's go!

4195
02:52:36,250 --> 02:52:36,670
Oh...

4196
02:52:37,250 --> 02:52:38,270
Oh, it's the only...

4197
02:52:38,270 --> 02:52:38,610
Oh no?

4198
02:52:38,950 --> 02:52:39,970
And a trophy?

4199
02:52:41,030 --> 02:52:43,530
Ghost looks at a mirror, sees a ghost, gets scared.

4200
02:52:45,310 --> 02:52:46,330
What about this one?

4201
02:52:47,570 --> 02:52:48,450
Haunted Tors!

4202
02:52:48,810 --> 02:52:50,290
Went on the search for ghosts.

4203
02:52:50,510 --> 02:52:53,670
You want to make sure you don't call in any additional bad luck.

4204
02:52:53,990 --> 02:52:57,390
Here are 13 Japanese superstitions to be aware of.

4205
02:52:58,450 --> 02:53:01,130
But you guys want ghosts, right?

4206
02:53:01,410 --> 02:53:02,530
Or ghosts.

4207
02:53:03,170 --> 02:53:05,910
You guys don't want to get rid of ghosts.

4208
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:09,570
You guys want more ghosts.

4209
02:53:10,430 --> 02:53:12,730
The number four is pronounced chi.

4210
02:53:13,070 --> 02:53:14,850
The same as the word for death.

4211
02:53:15,050 --> 02:53:16,850
And it is considered very unlucky.

4212
02:53:17,150 --> 02:53:21,110
As a result, many hotels do not have a number four or a fourth floor.

4213
02:53:21,290 --> 02:53:22,930
A room number four or a fourth floor.

4214
02:53:27,130 --> 02:53:31,490
The number nine and the word pain also share the pronunciation ku.

4215
02:53:31,490 --> 02:53:36,850
Though not as unlucky as four, nine is still frequently skipped in numbering rooms on floors...

4216
02:53:36,850 --> 02:53:38,250
Or floors in hospitals.

4217
02:53:39,070 --> 02:53:43,590
Whistling at night will attract s- s- s- sne- snake?

4218
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:02,480
Why can't I whistle right now?

4219
02:54:08,520 --> 02:54:09,700
Did it work?

4220
02:54:10,820 --> 02:54:11,820
He's here!

4221
02:54:12,020 --> 02:54:12,540
Oh my gosh!

4222
02:54:13,140 --> 02:54:15,220
Snake, you came to see me!

4223
02:54:18,020 --> 02:54:19,540
One haunting, please.

4224
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:26,860
Avoid sticking chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice as this is traditionally part of the funeral ritual.

4225
02:54:27,840 --> 02:54:29,200
Yeah, looks like the incense.

4226
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:31,660
Don't sleep with your head pointing north.

4227
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:32,680
Oh.

4228
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:37,780
Breaking a comb or the strap of your geta sandal will bring bad luck.

4229
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:40,580
Never write another person's name in red ink.

4230
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:42,660
Something bad will happen to them if you do.

4231
02:54:43,180 --> 02:54:44,140
Oh wait, what about this?

4232
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:45,220
It's supposed... Oh, there we go.

4233
02:54:47,460 --> 02:54:48,960
Big me to love.

4234
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:50,320
Yeah, thank you!

4235
02:54:53,180 --> 02:54:55,680
Seeing a spider in the morning is good luck!

4236
02:54:56,360 --> 02:54:57,920
I saw a spider today.

4237
02:54:58,140 --> 02:54:59,780
But seeing one at night is bad.

4238
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:05,980
You better not show yourself, little guy.

4239
02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:08,080
He was actually pretty big.

4240
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:10,240
Director's note.

4241
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:11,780
She kissed her little man right now.

4242
02:55:12,080 --> 02:55:12,800
Yeah, I did.

4243
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:17,240
Badgers?

4244
02:55:17,640 --> 02:55:18,520
Not cats.

4245
02:55:19,080 --> 02:55:20,500
Thank you for...

4246
02:55:21,800 --> 02:55:22,400
clarifying.

4247
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:26,760
Are considered unlucky because they wear masks to hide their eyes.

4248
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:29,120
What does that have to do with ghosts?

4249
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:32,960
Why did it single out cats?

4250
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:34,200
I don't know!

4251
02:55:35,440 --> 02:55:39,600
If you lie down immediately after eating, you'll turn into a cow?

4252
02:55:43,350 --> 02:55:47,350
Hide your thumb in if a funeral car passes you.

4253
02:55:49,030 --> 02:55:49,610
Okay.

4254
02:55:50,170 --> 02:55:52,310
Blood type influences one personality.

4255
02:55:52,310 --> 02:55:53,590
That's not a superstition.

4256
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:55,590
Well, I guess it is, kind of, but...

4257
02:55:59,290 --> 02:55:59,970
Ugh!

4258
02:56:00,710 --> 02:56:02,770
Never pass food from chopstick to chopstick.

4259
02:56:02,890 --> 02:56:04,410
This is another funeral ritual.

4260
02:56:09,790 --> 02:56:10,890
An eye...

4261
02:56:10,890 --> 02:56:12,730
Snake was here!

4262
02:56:16,630 --> 02:56:18,750
He left his eye patch!

4263
02:56:18,870 --> 02:56:20,010
And his beauty blender!

4264
02:56:20,390 --> 02:56:21,410
And his comb!

4265
02:56:21,410 --> 02:56:22,230
And his mug!

4266
02:56:22,790 --> 02:56:23,470
And...

4267
02:56:23,470 --> 02:56:24,950
His back massager!

4268
02:56:26,870 --> 02:56:28,610
I can't believe it!

4269
02:56:29,470 --> 02:56:30,510
Oh, no, no, no.

4270
02:56:31,230 --> 02:56:32,050
Oh god, that scared me.

4271
02:56:34,870 --> 02:56:35,410
Uh...

4272
02:56:35,410 --> 02:56:35,790
Turn around?

4273
02:56:39,510 --> 02:56:40,050
Whoa!

4274
02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:45,790
It looks like something is missing here.

4275
02:56:46,150 --> 02:56:46,710
It does?

4276
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:48,210
I don't see it.

4277
02:56:52,010 --> 02:56:53,010
Wait, that's...

4278
02:56:53,010 --> 02:56:54,230
Nancy, you didn't shower!

4279
02:56:56,450 --> 02:56:57,950
She's dirty!

4280
02:56:58,490 --> 02:57:00,710
Nancy Drew, you dirty, dirty!

4281
02:57:01,170 --> 02:57:03,470
You're supposed to shower before you get in!

4282
02:57:04,250 --> 02:57:05,970
The whistling worked!

4283
02:57:06,310 --> 02:57:07,250
Yeah, it did!

4284
02:57:09,570 --> 02:57:11,410
Nancy-san...

4285
02:57:11,410 --> 02:57:16,010
Nancy-san, where is your respect for the culture?

4286
02:57:17,850 --> 02:57:19,130
Kite and behavior!

4287
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:20,730
Truly!

4288
02:57:21,610 --> 02:57:23,190
Nasty Nancy!

4289
02:57:24,970 --> 02:57:27,470
She's ruining the bath for everybody else.

4290
02:57:30,990 --> 02:57:32,410
Well, that was spooky!

4291
02:57:33,970 --> 02:57:34,410
Um...

4292
02:57:34,410 --> 02:57:35,970
Uh, let's go talk to...

4293
02:57:35,970 --> 02:57:36,570
What's his name?

4294
02:57:36,650 --> 02:57:40,170
And see if he has anything to say about the ghost lady we saw in...

4295
02:57:40,170 --> 02:57:41,050
Hey!

4296
02:57:42,050 --> 02:57:42,630
Um...

4297
02:57:42,630 --> 02:57:44,870
Do you know what happened to the mirror in the baths?

4298
02:57:45,170 --> 02:57:46,390
Oh, that thing.

4299
02:57:46,750 --> 02:57:52,010
I sort of hid it a few years back and put a little heroin crack in it.

4300
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:54,630
Its days have been numbered for a while.

4301
02:57:55,050 --> 02:57:56,630
Sorry about breaking it.

4302
02:57:56,630 --> 02:57:56,990
What?

4303
02:57:57,130 --> 02:57:57,470
Oh, no!

4304
02:57:57,950 --> 02:57:58,770
Don't worry.

4305
02:57:59,090 --> 02:58:01,050
I'm just glad you didn't get hurt.

4306
02:58:02,290 --> 02:58:05,090
Mirrors can be very dangerous when they're breaking.

4307
02:58:05,690 --> 02:58:07,150
In more ways than one.

4308
02:58:07,850 --> 02:58:08,770
What do you mean?

4309
02:58:09,590 --> 02:58:11,670
Oh, shards of glass and such.

4310
02:58:12,230 --> 02:58:14,390
Not something to fool around with.

4311
02:58:15,150 --> 02:58:17,370
Something weird happened when I looked in the mirror.

4312
02:58:17,550 --> 02:58:18,470
I didn't see my...

4313
02:58:18,470 --> 02:58:19,410
Wait, that's cat...

4314
02:58:19,410 --> 02:58:20,190
That's actually...

4315
02:58:20,190 --> 02:58:21,830
That wasn't just a game thing?

4316
02:58:22,110 --> 02:58:24,830
Wait, we actually weren't supposed to see our reflection?

4317
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:26,890
Something weird happened.

4318
02:58:27,170 --> 02:58:30,030
When I looked in the mirror, I didn't see my reflection.

4319
02:58:31,030 --> 02:58:31,510
Aha!

4320
02:58:32,390 --> 02:58:33,570
You know what happened?

4321
02:58:34,030 --> 02:58:35,150
You're a vampire!

4322
02:58:35,710 --> 02:58:36,550
That's a vampire!

4323
02:58:36,550 --> 02:58:37,810
Seriously, though, that's pretty messed up.

4324
02:58:38,410 --> 02:58:40,450
Maybe you need to get a little rest.

4325
02:58:40,930 --> 02:58:43,010
This place might be getting to you a little.

4326
02:58:43,210 --> 02:58:44,530
No, I need more nonograms.

4327
02:58:44,530 --> 02:58:45,870
I'm back for more nonograms.

4328
02:58:46,090 --> 02:58:46,830
Here you go!

4329
02:58:47,350 --> 02:58:47,750
Thank you.

4330
02:58:48,970 --> 02:58:50,050
I should go.

4331
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:51,190
I'll talk to you later.

4332
02:58:51,890 --> 02:58:52,730
Catch you around!

4333
02:58:54,650 --> 02:58:56,790
He's been eating whatever the hell that is.

4334
02:58:57,190 --> 02:58:57,390
Oh, wait.

4335
02:58:57,590 --> 02:58:58,430
Maybe he's not eating.

4336
02:58:58,730 --> 02:59:00,390
I thought he was eating a little thing.

4337
02:59:01,130 --> 02:59:02,330
He's looking at something.

4338
02:59:02,530 --> 02:59:03,310
I thought he was...

4339
02:59:03,310 --> 02:59:05,150
I was like, he's been eating that for a long time.

4340
02:59:05,530 --> 02:59:06,790
It's 9 p.m.

4341
02:59:08,510 --> 02:59:08,950
Uh...

4342
02:59:12,170 --> 02:59:13,830
Wait, I can take a picture of him.

4343
02:59:19,860 --> 02:59:21,400
Wow, 2010 camera.

4344
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:24,240
This looks really creepy, huh?

4345
02:59:25,220 --> 02:59:25,660
Real...

4346
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:27,620
Real creeper shot here.

4347
02:59:30,860 --> 02:59:32,020
Oh, God.

4348
02:59:32,740 --> 02:59:33,660
I saved it.

4349
02:59:36,100 --> 02:59:37,900
Can you set it as your wallpaper?

4350
02:59:38,220 --> 02:59:39,060
Oh, let's try it.

4351
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:39,980
Settings.

4352
02:59:40,920 --> 02:59:41,600
Background.

4353
02:59:42,300 --> 02:59:43,360
Dave Gregory?

4354
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:45,000
Who the hell is this?

4355
02:59:58,590 --> 03:00:00,510
I'm Dave Gregory.

4356
03:00:04,270 --> 03:00:06,530
The Canute Farmhouse?

4357
03:00:06,750 --> 03:00:07,450
Okay, cute.

4358
03:00:07,970 --> 03:00:08,730
Lounge.

4359
03:00:09,070 --> 03:00:09,250
Okay.

4360
03:00:10,250 --> 03:00:11,010
Snorkeling.

4361
03:00:11,190 --> 03:00:11,590
Cute.

4362
03:00:11,890 --> 03:00:12,670
Wait, what is that?

4363
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:14,850
Oh, a turtle!

4364
03:00:16,470 --> 03:00:17,590
That's fun.

4365
03:00:19,030 --> 03:00:20,770
Kyler Mallory.

4366
03:00:21,030 --> 03:00:21,190
Why?

4367
03:00:21,450 --> 03:00:22,270
Who are these?

4368
03:00:26,510 --> 03:00:27,390
Uh...

4369
03:00:27,390 --> 03:00:28,170
It's locked.

4370
03:00:29,410 --> 03:00:31,190
Oh, that's cute!

4371
03:00:31,870 --> 03:00:35,590
It's like the original Nancy Drew pictures!

4372
03:00:35,590 --> 03:00:36,790
Wait, that's so cute.

4373
03:00:37,470 --> 03:00:38,130
Classic.

4374
03:00:38,950 --> 03:00:39,330
Aw.

4375
03:00:40,470 --> 03:00:41,190
Silhouette.

4376
03:00:41,810 --> 03:00:41,850
Ooh.

4377
03:00:43,090 --> 03:00:44,330
Okay, Dave Gregory.

4378
03:00:46,010 --> 03:00:47,410
Green, obviously.

4379
03:00:48,850 --> 03:00:50,430
Oh, shut up!

4380
03:00:50,530 --> 03:00:51,410
Oh, my God!

4381
03:00:56,800 --> 03:00:57,860
Oh, shut up.

4382
03:00:59,080 --> 03:00:59,800
Oh,

4383
03:01:04,880 --> 03:01:05,360
my God.

4384
03:01:05,360 --> 03:01:07,380
You know what that just reminded me of?

4385
03:01:07,580 --> 03:01:10,180
Did anybody else have the Nickelodeon alarm clock?

4386
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:11,800
That did that?

4387
03:01:15,360 --> 03:01:17,080
I'm gonna be like, Wake up!

4388
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:18,680
Wake up!

4389
03:01:27,140 --> 03:01:28,700
You still have one!

4390
03:01:28,820 --> 03:01:29,520
That's crazy!

4391
03:01:30,340 --> 03:01:30,940
Boop, boop, boop, boop!

4392
03:01:37,030 --> 03:01:39,310
I think this is Arthur Morgan.

4393
03:01:40,310 --> 03:01:41,110
Oh, God!

4394
03:01:41,430 --> 03:01:42,430
Let's do the explosion.

4395
03:01:42,450 --> 03:01:43,110
I like that.

4396
03:01:44,410 --> 03:01:45,330
Do I have any messages?

4397
03:01:45,530 --> 03:01:46,330
Nobody loves me!

4398
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:56,300
How do I change the photo?

4399
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:02,980
God, the beeping sound is so annoying, though.

4400
03:02:05,580 --> 03:02:07,060
Okay, I guess we'll go to sleep.

4401
03:02:07,580 --> 03:02:08,260
I guess?

4402
03:02:08,500 --> 03:02:10,000
Is there, like, a time limit in this game?

4403
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:10,520
I don't know.

4404
03:02:15,490 --> 03:02:15,830
Okay.

4405
03:02:16,370 --> 03:02:17,430
Yeah, we're on the right side.

4406
03:02:17,610 --> 03:02:17,950
Oh!

4407
03:02:18,170 --> 03:02:18,310
Wait!

4408
03:02:18,410 --> 03:02:18,850
No, no, no!

4409
03:02:19,570 --> 03:02:21,010
We can go to Pachinko!

4410
03:02:24,710 --> 03:02:25,910
We can go to Pachinko!

4411
03:02:26,010 --> 03:02:26,310
I forgot.

4412
03:02:28,310 --> 03:02:29,410
Yeah, Pachinko time, baby!

4413
03:02:29,410 --> 03:02:31,550
All right, so it was, uh...

4414
03:02:32,370 --> 03:02:33,950
All the way at Kurei.

4415
03:02:34,250 --> 03:02:34,990
Oh, wait!

4416
03:02:35,410 --> 03:02:35,750
Oh!

4417
03:02:36,150 --> 03:02:37,270
No way!

4418
03:02:37,990 --> 03:02:39,470
We have a speed!

4419
03:02:41,950 --> 03:02:42,630
Yeah!

4420
03:02:45,820 --> 03:02:46,500
Nice.

4421
03:02:49,380 --> 03:02:52,080
Nancy Drew's crippling Pachinko addiction.

4422
03:02:52,360 --> 03:02:54,040
Look, it didn't even take any time!

4423
03:02:58,250 --> 03:03:01,630
I need to find a card first before I can play Pachinko.

4424
03:03:01,730 --> 03:03:02,130
I did.

4425
03:03:02,630 --> 03:03:03,070
This one.

4426
03:03:04,470 --> 03:03:05,070
Okay.

4427
03:03:06,550 --> 03:03:07,550
Oh my god!

4428
03:03:07,750 --> 03:03:08,470
Wait, it's actual.

4429
03:03:12,530 --> 03:03:13,490
Come on!

4430
03:03:13,850 --> 03:03:14,850
Come on, flower!

4431
03:03:15,450 --> 03:03:15,730
Oh!

4432
03:03:16,210 --> 03:03:16,810
Yippee!

4433
03:03:17,150 --> 03:03:17,370
Okay.

4434
03:03:18,730 --> 03:03:20,630
I have 47 balls left.

4435
03:03:21,590 --> 03:03:22,190
Flower!

4436
03:03:24,170 --> 03:03:24,770
Nice.

4437
03:03:24,930 --> 03:03:25,990
I keep getting the little beaver.

4438
03:03:27,910 --> 03:03:28,450
I don't...

4439
03:03:28,450 --> 03:03:29,270
How many do I need?

4440
03:03:31,690 --> 03:03:32,130
Please!

4441
03:03:32,410 --> 03:03:33,250
Please, flower!

4442
03:03:33,910 --> 03:03:34,350
Oh!

4443
03:03:36,980 --> 03:03:37,420
Ugh.

4444
03:03:37,740 --> 03:03:38,760
How many did I need?

4445
03:03:43,740 --> 03:03:45,800
You need to play a lot to get all the prizes.

4446
03:03:46,060 --> 03:03:46,500
Oh!

4447
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:47,200
So close!

4448
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:48,800
So rude.

4449
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:52,500
Oh!

4450
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:52,820
Oh!

4451
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:53,280
Oh yeah!

4452
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:53,600
Oh!

4453
03:03:53,740 --> 03:03:53,820
Oh!

4454
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:55,020
Okay, nice!

4455
03:04:00,420 --> 03:04:01,880
Okay, it's not worth it.

4456
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:07,860
Nice!

4457
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:12,020
So close.

4458
03:04:12,740 --> 03:04:14,300
To flower...

4459
03:04:16,300 --> 03:04:17,280
Frog!

4460
03:04:18,120 --> 03:04:19,820
40 winnings!

4461
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:20,320
Let's go!

4462
03:04:20,840 --> 03:04:21,680
Okay, nice.

4463
03:04:22,700 --> 03:04:24,600
Okay, flower is totally worth it.

4464
03:04:25,380 --> 03:04:26,720
Flower is the way.

4465
03:04:31,060 --> 03:04:32,620
Big winnings!

4466
03:04:32,700 --> 03:04:33,320
Big winnings!

4467
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:34,840
Come on, flower!

4468
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:35,980
Please!

4469
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:36,920
Ah!

4470
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:44,000
Yeah!

4471
03:04:44,360 --> 03:04:45,800
I love gambling!

4472
03:04:46,320 --> 03:04:47,040
Nice!

4473
03:04:47,280 --> 03:04:48,100
We got the...

4474
03:04:48,100 --> 03:04:48,860
The...

4475
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:49,760
Little raccoon.

4476
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:52,540
Ah!

4477
03:04:56,040 --> 03:04:56,740
What's that mean?

4478
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:59,060
Oh, maybe because I didn't get a star.

4479
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:01,120
But I should have a star.

4480
03:05:04,320 --> 03:05:05,280
I think that's a hole.

4481
03:05:05,460 --> 03:05:05,700
Nice.

4482
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:05,960
Okay.

4483
03:05:06,220 --> 03:05:07,020
Oh yeah, at least got something.

4484
03:05:10,760 --> 03:05:11,940
Oh, oh, so close!

4485
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:12,720
Please!

4486
03:05:26,690 --> 03:05:27,390
Uh-oh.

4487
03:05:31,250 --> 03:05:31,770
Yeah!

4488
03:05:33,190 --> 03:05:35,130
Can Pachinko be the rest of the game?

4489
03:05:41,170 --> 03:05:42,070
Oh my god!

4490
03:05:42,230 --> 03:05:42,730
We almost...

4491
03:05:42,730 --> 03:05:43,990
I hit the jackpot, I think.

4492
03:05:47,660 --> 03:05:48,180
Okay.

4493
03:05:56,810 --> 03:05:57,330
200!

4494
03:05:58,890 --> 03:06:00,490
We have 20 left, you guys.

4495
03:06:00,810 --> 03:06:01,330
Come on.

4496
03:06:02,830 --> 03:06:04,190
Nanshi-doru!

4497
03:06:05,590 --> 03:06:06,270
Nanshi!

4498
03:06:07,470 --> 03:06:08,150
Nanshi!

4499
03:06:08,650 --> 03:06:10,950
9-9-9th Nancy Drew Game.

4500
03:06:11,070 --> 03:06:13,750
Nancy Drew The Vanishing Wallet and Gambling Curse.

4501
03:06:14,350 --> 03:06:17,230
Yeah, Nancy hasn't been the same since she came back from Japan.

4502
03:06:18,110 --> 03:06:19,310
Oh, come on.

4503
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:26,520
Nice!

4504
03:06:32,760 --> 03:06:34,500
Ready for three hour pachinko.

4505
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:37,920
I don't know how many I need, though, for it.

4506
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:40,060
We only have 10 balls left.

4507
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:42,880
Oh, come on.

4508
03:06:42,920 --> 03:06:43,760
That was the worst one.

4509
03:06:47,860 --> 03:06:48,620
Oh, nice!

4510
03:06:48,820 --> 03:06:49,460
Oh, come on!

4511
03:06:52,320 --> 03:06:53,920
Sometimes the other ones will, like, hit it.

4512
03:07:00,020 --> 03:07:00,740
Come on!

4513
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:01,460
Nanshi!

4514
03:07:02,900 --> 03:07:03,340
Nanshi!

4515
03:07:07,660 --> 03:07:08,100
Nanshi!

4516
03:07:08,720 --> 03:07:09,140
Nanshi!

4517
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:11,560
Nanshi!

4518
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:11,920
Nanshi!

4519
03:07:13,420 --> 03:07:14,060
Nanshi!

4520
03:07:22,270 --> 03:07:22,910
Yippee!

4521
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:26,010
That's all of our earnings.

4522
03:07:26,330 --> 03:07:26,690
Nice.

4523
03:07:27,270 --> 03:07:30,610
I'd like to see what the comic has to say about hauntings.

4524
03:07:32,290 --> 03:07:34,090
I don't have enough for anything.

4525
03:07:36,830 --> 03:07:38,050
No way.

4526
03:07:38,810 --> 03:07:39,470
Way.

4527
03:07:42,270 --> 03:07:43,970
I don't have...

4528
03:07:46,100 --> 03:07:48,200
I have nothing.

4529
03:07:58,680 --> 03:08:01,760
I'm taking my earnings with me.

4530
03:08:04,680 --> 03:08:07,260
I'm sorry, but what are these even?

4531
03:08:07,760 --> 03:08:11,220
That this costs 790 balls.

4532
03:08:12,220 --> 03:08:13,460
This is really...

4533
03:08:13,460 --> 03:08:15,540
This is balls, this game.

4534
03:08:17,320 --> 03:08:18,260
All right, Nancy.

4535
03:08:18,400 --> 03:08:19,080
Time to go home.

4536
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:23,700
It's been 10 minutes since we've played.

4537
03:08:36,040 --> 03:08:37,680
We got here so fast.

4538
03:08:38,980 --> 03:08:40,660
Back to our creepy hotel.

4539
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:42,060
Gosh.

4540
03:08:42,540 --> 03:08:43,500
How can I get more?

4541
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:43,940
Please.

4542
03:08:44,340 --> 03:08:44,860
Please.

4543
03:08:45,180 --> 03:08:45,620
Hi.

4544
03:08:45,820 --> 03:08:46,280
Hi.

4545
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:47,220
I'm addicted.

4546
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:47,900
I'll let you go.

4547
03:08:47,960 --> 03:08:49,200
I'm addicted to gambling.

4548
03:08:49,460 --> 03:08:49,660
Please.

4549
03:08:49,660 --> 03:08:52,340
Wait, we need to wait until 1 a.m.

4550
03:08:52,420 --> 03:08:52,580
No?

4551
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:53,400
What should we do?

4552
03:08:54,700 --> 03:08:55,980
Dave is so dreamy.

4553
03:08:57,040 --> 03:08:57,980
What should we...

4554
03:08:57,980 --> 03:08:59,440
I know what we can do.

4555
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:02,100
Nonogram.

4556
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:07,060
Time to join the Yakuza to get money for Pachinko.

4557
03:09:07,220 --> 03:09:08,300
Nancy must gamble.

4558
03:09:09,280 --> 03:09:09,600
Yeah.

4559
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:12,180
All right.

4560
03:09:21,900 --> 03:09:22,900
All right.

4561
03:09:22,900 --> 03:09:24,000
Oh.

4562
03:09:24,180 --> 03:09:24,380
Oops.

4563
03:09:27,140 --> 03:09:27,720
It is?

4564
03:09:30,700 --> 03:09:31,780
Oh my gosh.

4565
03:09:32,120 --> 03:09:32,260
What?

4566
03:09:32,420 --> 03:09:33,000
There we go.

4567
03:09:40,700 --> 03:09:43,000
The music is all creepy again.

4568
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:55,620
Just give me...

4569
03:09:55,620 --> 03:09:57,160
Let me play one game.

4570
03:09:59,720 --> 03:10:00,000
Wait.

4571
03:10:00,180 --> 03:10:03,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

4572
03:10:03,240 --> 03:10:03,320
Okay.

4573
03:10:03,460 --> 03:10:03,580
Okay.

4574
03:10:03,700 --> 03:10:03,760
Good.

4575
03:10:05,820 --> 03:10:06,100
Um...

4576
03:10:07,640 --> 03:10:09,080
Let me just do one game.

4577
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:10,420
One game.

4578
03:10:10,520 --> 03:10:10,940
I promise.

4579
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:11,760
Just one.

4580
03:10:13,140 --> 03:10:14,200
This is me...

4581
03:10:14,200 --> 03:10:17,900
This is literally what I look like before I go to sleep.

4582
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:20,140
I'm just playing P-Cross.

4583
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:22,080
Or...

4584
03:10:22,080 --> 03:10:23,100
You know...

4585
03:10:23,100 --> 03:10:24,320
Not P-Cross.

4586
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:25,800
Meow Tower.

4587
03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:28,520
Um...

4588
03:10:28,520 --> 03:10:28,580
Oh.

4589
03:10:33,740 --> 03:10:34,220
Wait.

4590
03:10:34,740 --> 03:10:35,020
Wait?

4591
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:38,480
Wait.

4592
03:10:38,660 --> 03:10:41,520
I think 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

4593
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:42,260
12.

4594
03:10:42,900 --> 03:10:43,340
You.

4595
03:10:44,220 --> 03:10:44,560
Wait.

4596
03:10:44,720 --> 03:10:46,900
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11.

4597
03:10:47,020 --> 03:10:47,300
Yeah, yeah.

4598
03:10:47,500 --> 03:10:47,700
Okay.

4599
03:10:48,500 --> 03:10:49,460
I can't count.

4600
03:10:49,860 --> 03:10:51,820
I was gonna say that's not right at all.

4601
03:10:55,660 --> 03:10:56,100
5.

4602
03:10:56,500 --> 03:10:57,300
3, 4.

4603
03:10:58,100 --> 03:10:59,520
2, 2, 3.

4604
03:10:59,880 --> 03:11:00,720
There we go.

4605
03:11:00,940 --> 03:11:01,540
There we go.

4606
03:11:01,700 --> 03:11:02,360
There we go.

4607
03:11:09,800 --> 03:11:10,240
There we go.

4608
03:11:10,680 --> 03:11:10,940
Yep.

4609
03:11:11,140 --> 03:11:11,440
There we go.

4610
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:12,960
4.

4611
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:13,420
5.

4612
03:11:21,630 --> 03:11:22,330
Ta-da.

4613
03:11:24,130 --> 03:11:27,270
We require an entire nonogram stream now.

4614
03:11:28,190 --> 03:11:29,890
Too much pressure.

4615
03:11:30,670 --> 03:11:31,750
Too much pressure.

4616
03:11:31,990 --> 03:11:32,910
I like to just play.

4617
03:11:33,470 --> 03:11:35,050
Otherwise, I mess up.

4618
03:11:35,910 --> 03:11:37,450
5, 6, 7.

4619
03:11:38,990 --> 03:11:40,630
Too much pressure.

4620
03:11:47,740 --> 03:11:51,560
2, 2, 2, 3, 1.

4621
03:11:51,780 --> 03:11:51,920
Okay.

4622
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:53,800
2, 3, 4.

4623
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:55,540
Okay.

4624
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:57,000
Okay.

4625
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:00,920
I mean, keep watching from work.

4626
03:12:00,920 --> 03:12:01,480
Have a nice evening.

4627
03:12:01,940 --> 03:12:02,340
You too.

4628
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:05,120
You too.

4629
03:12:05,120 --> 03:12:06,380
2, okay.

4630
03:12:07,560 --> 03:12:08,760
Uh, 4.

4631
03:12:09,660 --> 03:12:11,300
Um, 5.

4632
03:12:12,700 --> 03:12:14,640
Oh, 2, 1.

4633
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:16,180
1.

4634
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:18,480
Uh.

4635
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:29,960
What am I missing?

4636
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,000
This one's done too.

4637
03:12:34,780 --> 03:12:35,380
Five.

4638
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:37,060
Like that.

4639
03:12:37,420 --> 03:12:37,640
Four.

4640
03:12:38,700 --> 03:12:40,540
See, it's actually quite easy.

4641
03:12:41,300 --> 03:12:42,080
You know.

4642
03:12:45,140 --> 03:12:46,720
It's actually quite easy.

4643
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:48,460
Even I get mixed up sometimes too.

4644
03:12:48,460 --> 03:12:49,900
As you saw earlier.

4645
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:52,900
But it's actually very simple.

4646
03:12:56,020 --> 03:12:56,540
Tanuki.

4647
03:12:56,700 --> 03:12:57,520
Oh, I see it.

4648
03:12:57,840 --> 03:12:58,440
I do.

4649
03:12:58,600 --> 03:12:58,920
I see it.

4650
03:12:59,020 --> 03:12:59,320
I see it.

4651
03:12:59,420 --> 03:12:59,960
I see it.

4652
03:13:00,960 --> 03:13:01,820
So cute.

4653
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:03,840
I like that one.

4654
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:05,640
Two.

4655
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:10,300
Let's see.

4656
03:13:11,340 --> 03:13:11,780
One, one.

4657
03:13:23,090 --> 03:13:24,230
What else am I missing?

4658
03:13:38,290 --> 03:13:39,230
One, one, real.

4659
03:13:40,730 --> 03:13:41,530
This one, yeah.

4660
03:13:43,050 --> 03:13:44,910
But I don't know which one it is.

4661
03:13:51,920 --> 03:13:53,620
Gotta be around the cheeks, right?

4662
03:13:54,200 --> 03:13:55,100
Probably like that.

4663
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:57,800
Let's see if it works.

4664
03:13:58,960 --> 03:14:00,040
Let's see if it works.

4665
03:14:02,480 --> 03:14:03,100
Solved it.

4666
03:14:06,420 --> 03:14:07,140
Um.

4667
03:14:07,720 --> 03:14:10,260
This is actually a badger whom we cannot trust.

4668
03:14:10,680 --> 03:14:14,120
Because he wears a mask over his eyes.

4669
03:14:14,580 --> 03:14:14,920
What?

4670
03:14:15,020 --> 03:14:15,940
It's only 10.02!

4671
03:14:16,420 --> 03:14:17,200
10.03.

4672
03:14:17,940 --> 03:14:18,500
Uh.

4673
03:14:19,320 --> 03:14:20,280
Back to Pachinko.

4674
03:14:20,520 --> 03:14:21,600
Someone said it's unlimited, right?

4675
03:14:24,360 --> 03:14:25,080
Wait.

4676
03:14:26,100 --> 03:14:28,140
Let's go back to Pachinko, I suppose.

4677
03:14:31,140 --> 03:14:33,460
Away from this haunted-ass...

4678
03:14:33,460 --> 03:14:34,820
Location.

4679
03:14:35,620 --> 03:14:36,260
Scary.

4680
03:14:37,180 --> 03:14:38,460
Could be a cat.

4681
03:14:38,960 --> 03:14:40,480
I don't think it's a cat.

4682
03:14:45,810 --> 03:14:47,330
Do-do-do-do.

4683
03:14:48,130 --> 03:14:49,610
Are we sure it's unlimited?

4684
03:14:52,150 --> 03:14:53,010
I'll try.

4685
03:14:56,890 --> 03:14:58,630
It is unlimited!

4686
03:15:16,620 --> 03:15:17,260
Oh.

4687
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:24,440
Wait.

4688
03:15:24,540 --> 03:15:26,960
Why did I see like five of them drop down just now?

4689
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:27,100
I don't.

4690
03:15:36,650 --> 03:15:37,130
Winnings!

4691
03:15:37,550 --> 03:15:38,030
Ugh.

4692
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:39,350
Come

4693
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:44,700
on!

4694
03:15:45,060 --> 03:15:45,220
Come on!

4695
03:15:45,220 --> 03:15:45,740
Do-do-do-do-do.

4696
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:50,950
We got more than last time though.

4697
03:15:52,050 --> 03:15:52,470
Damn.

4698
03:15:57,300 --> 03:15:57,500
Come on!

4699
03:15:57,640 --> 03:15:58,380
Big winnings!

4700
03:16:00,760 --> 03:16:01,240
Star.

4701
03:16:03,100 --> 03:16:03,580
Wow.

4702
03:16:03,580 --> 03:16:04,120
This sucks.

4703
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:07,480
Take my winnings and I'll go elsewhere.

4704
03:16:07,900 --> 03:16:08,400
To you!

4705
03:16:09,420 --> 03:16:10,980
Wait, they actually look different.

4706
03:16:11,140 --> 03:16:11,660
That's kind of crazy.

4707
03:16:25,100 --> 03:16:26,400
Go, go, go!

4708
03:16:37,110 --> 03:16:38,810
It's so loud when it does that.

4709
03:16:41,030 --> 03:16:42,110
Let's go gambling!

4710
03:16:47,450 --> 03:16:48,450
Making big money.

4711
03:16:53,210 --> 03:16:54,710
How much do I have?

4712
03:16:54,850 --> 03:16:55,230
600!

4713
03:16:56,170 --> 03:16:59,910
The reason why it's free is because the card is using someone else's wallet.

4714
03:17:01,250 --> 03:17:02,510
Damn, how much we got now?

4715
03:17:03,730 --> 03:17:05,130
1024, how much was it?

4716
03:17:06,830 --> 03:17:07,390
Wait.

4717
03:17:09,810 --> 03:17:11,330
Guys, it's different stuff.

4718
03:17:11,850 --> 03:17:13,130
This must be the comic.

4719
03:17:14,330 --> 03:17:16,430
But it's different stuff.

4720
03:17:16,810 --> 03:17:18,130
This one's so expensive.

4721
03:17:22,180 --> 03:17:26,960
Grandma would love this because she's saying that I'm experiencing real Japanese culture.

4722
03:17:30,740 --> 03:17:31,160
Oops.

4723
03:17:32,660 --> 03:17:34,020
So don't worry about it.

4724
03:17:38,620 --> 03:17:40,740
She would be like, wow, this is authentic...

4725
03:17:41,480 --> 03:17:41,840
Oops, sorry.

4726
03:17:42,180 --> 03:17:43,200
Japanese culture.

4727
03:17:48,250 --> 03:17:50,630
People line up at like 6 in the morning to do this.

4728
03:17:57,660 --> 03:17:59,700
And it's not gambling, it's just little balls.

4729
03:18:04,330 --> 03:18:05,770
Proud grandma moment.

4730
03:18:08,170 --> 03:18:08,990
Uh-oh.

4731
03:18:09,210 --> 03:18:10,150
Guys, our big earnings.

4732
03:18:10,550 --> 03:18:11,730
Where's our big earnings?

4733
03:18:12,330 --> 03:18:14,070
We're gonna walk out with 5?

4734
03:18:14,750 --> 03:18:15,750
Okay, come on.

4735
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:15,770
Huh?

4736
03:18:18,830 --> 03:18:21,090
That should've been huge jackpot.

4737
03:18:26,830 --> 03:18:27,970
Huge jackpot!

4738
03:18:29,370 --> 03:18:32,640
What the?

4739
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:33,620
Spooky number!

4740
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:34,620
Spooky number!

4741
03:19:08,190 --> 03:19:10,530
The adventures of Koji and Kit.

4742
03:19:10,530 --> 03:19:11,470
Yure.

4743
03:19:13,310 --> 03:19:14,150
Shiawase Comics.

4744
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:17,250
What else do you guys want?

4745
03:19:18,010 --> 03:19:18,790
It's on...

4746
03:19:18,790 --> 03:19:19,990
Wait, I could get you...

4747
03:19:20,390 --> 03:19:21,290
What are these?

4748
03:19:22,050 --> 03:19:23,050
I'll get it.

4749
03:19:24,090 --> 03:19:25,690
Oh, it's a little bell.

4750
03:19:25,990 --> 03:19:26,950
That costs too much.

4751
03:19:27,090 --> 03:19:28,030
It's a little bell.

4752
03:19:28,490 --> 03:19:30,850
That one's for you, little princess.

4753
03:19:33,530 --> 03:19:34,550
Pachinko Queen!

4754
03:19:35,390 --> 03:19:36,330
What time is it?

4755
03:19:40,150 --> 03:19:41,730
It's only 10.19!

4756
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:51,160
Let's try for the whale.

4757
03:19:52,520 --> 03:19:53,720
We're whaling!

4758
03:19:54,420 --> 03:19:55,040
Get it?

4759
03:19:58,600 --> 03:19:59,500
Get it!

4760
03:20:01,400 --> 03:20:03,000
This is our lucky one.

4761
03:20:06,900 --> 03:20:08,600
This is my first stone, no sag.

4762
03:20:08,600 --> 03:20:09,580
Oh, sorry!

4763
03:20:09,860 --> 03:20:10,180
Some...

4764
03:20:10,180 --> 03:20:12,940
I said earlier at the beginning of the stream that I'm not gonna...

4765
03:20:12,940 --> 03:20:14,020
Be able to see all of them.

4766
03:20:14,140 --> 03:20:14,580
I'm sorry.

4767
03:20:15,940 --> 03:20:17,460
Is this game in real time?

4768
03:20:22,760 --> 03:20:24,160
No, it can't be.

4769
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:26,760
Wait.

4770
03:20:27,720 --> 03:20:28,280
No!

4771
03:20:31,020 --> 03:20:31,580
No!

4772
03:20:32,180 --> 03:20:32,740
Wait.

4773
03:20:33,660 --> 03:20:36,060
It's 10.21 for me right now.

4774
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:40,000
Wait, you guys.

4775
03:20:40,180 --> 03:20:42,780
It's literally like the time on Nancy's phone for me right now.

4776
03:20:52,570 --> 03:20:54,430
She found her true calling.

4777
03:20:59,550 --> 03:21:02,730
Thank you to whoever told me about the card being...

4778
03:21:04,850 --> 03:21:05,890
Unlimited because...

4779
03:21:06,430 --> 03:21:07,430
That was huge.

4780
03:21:10,430 --> 03:21:11,370
Oh, yeah!

4781
03:21:11,370 --> 03:21:11,570
Yeah!

4782
03:21:15,430 --> 03:21:16,850
Are you Nancy Drew?

4783
03:21:18,590 --> 03:21:19,350
Oh my god!

4784
03:21:19,410 --> 03:21:21,470
It's literally 10.22 for me right now!

4785
03:21:22,010 --> 03:21:24,790
Okay, just turn to 10.23 in the game, but...

4786
03:21:24,790 --> 03:21:25,730
That's freaky!

4787
03:21:27,210 --> 03:21:28,210
That's freaky!

4788
03:21:28,470 --> 03:21:28,650
No!

4789
03:21:31,270 --> 03:21:32,530
It's a little freaky, no?

4790
03:21:42,060 --> 03:21:43,340
We hit something big.

4791
03:21:47,740 --> 03:21:50,400
This is the luckiest machine ever, you guys.

4792
03:21:53,580 --> 03:21:55,060
They forgot to rig this one.

4793
03:22:01,280 --> 03:22:03,180
Oh, that almost was a jackpot.

4794
03:22:10,830 --> 03:22:11,730
Oh, yeah!

4795
03:22:14,810 --> 03:22:17,010
It's also 10.23 for me now.

4796
03:22:18,530 --> 03:22:20,110
East Coast, best coast.

4797
03:22:20,110 --> 03:22:20,190
East Coast.

4798
03:22:23,190 --> 03:22:24,010
All right!

4799
03:22:24,490 --> 03:22:25,030
How much we got?

4800
03:22:25,770 --> 03:22:26,710
1,500.

4801
03:22:29,270 --> 03:22:30,270
I'm unstoppable.

4802
03:22:30,750 --> 03:22:32,190
I'm robbing them blind.

4803
03:22:45,440 --> 03:22:46,000
Oh!

4804
03:23:04,360 --> 03:23:06,060
I think I'm too good at this game.

4805
03:23:12,210 --> 03:23:13,390
Jackpot again.

4806
03:23:13,390 --> 03:23:13,530
Jackpot again.

4807
03:23:14,450 --> 03:23:15,010
Yeah!

4808
03:23:16,770 --> 03:23:17,470
Yeah!

4809
03:23:21,800 --> 03:23:23,060
How much was it?

4810
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:26,760
26.

4811
03:23:27,240 --> 03:23:27,320
Okay.

4812
03:23:28,140 --> 03:23:29,680
Maybe a game or two more.

4813
03:23:30,860 --> 03:23:31,060
Oops.

4814
03:23:32,680 --> 03:23:34,360
A game or two more!

4815
03:23:35,280 --> 03:23:37,360
But we have to wait until 1am.

4816
03:23:38,480 --> 03:23:42,740
I could try setting an alarm, but it says, like, I should sleep.

4817
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:46,080
I don't think she knows about the computer yet.

4818
03:23:46,240 --> 03:23:46,800
Maybe she does.

4819
03:23:46,960 --> 03:23:47,300
I don't know.

4820
03:23:49,660 --> 03:23:51,240
For now, I'll just get the...

4821
03:23:52,200 --> 03:23:53,220
I'll just get the whale.

4822
03:24:04,230 --> 03:24:05,810
I'm getting a cough drop real quick.

4823
03:24:06,350 --> 03:24:08,010
My throat's hurting a little bit today.

4824
03:24:11,830 --> 03:24:12,230
Oh!

4825
03:24:12,730 --> 03:24:13,730
I broke the game.

4826
03:24:17,070 --> 03:24:18,210
Wait, I broke it!

4827
03:24:23,290 --> 03:24:24,350
Wait, I broke it!

4828
03:24:25,150 --> 03:24:25,930
Oh, there they go.

4829
03:24:26,030 --> 03:24:26,490
There they go.

4830
03:24:34,220 --> 03:24:35,300
Gambling looks really easy.

4831
03:24:35,420 --> 03:24:35,960
I gotta try this.

4832
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:36,700
I know!

4833
03:24:38,240 --> 03:24:39,760
Maybe you can change PC clock.

4834
03:24:40,020 --> 03:24:41,180
I don't think it's real time.

4835
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:43,980
But that would be crazy though.

4836
03:24:44,480 --> 03:24:44,880
Let's see.

4837
03:24:44,980 --> 03:24:45,700
Oh my god.

4838
03:24:45,880 --> 03:24:47,220
I keep forgetting these fights.

4839
03:24:49,320 --> 03:24:49,760
1am.

4840
03:24:55,860 --> 03:24:56,820
Don't say you're busy.

4841
03:24:56,940 --> 03:24:58,860
This would be a strange place to sleep.

4842
03:24:59,060 --> 03:25:00,080
Why are we sleeping here?

4843
03:25:06,480 --> 03:25:08,320
One whale for you, my princess.

4844
03:25:14,540 --> 03:25:15,940
Wait, it's not in my inventory.

4845
03:25:17,040 --> 03:25:17,980
Oh, yes it is.

4846
03:25:26,010 --> 03:25:26,410
Um...

4847
03:25:26,830 --> 03:25:27,710
Wait, where is he?

4848
03:25:30,750 --> 03:25:31,830
Wait, where did he go?

4849
03:25:32,450 --> 03:25:33,530
Is he on my phone?

4850
03:25:33,970 --> 03:25:35,630
He's on my phone!

4851
03:25:35,950 --> 03:25:37,010
That's so cute!

4852
03:25:38,970 --> 03:25:40,690
Wait, that's actually so cute.

4853
03:25:47,690 --> 03:25:49,890
Back when phone charms were popular.

4854
03:25:52,250 --> 03:25:52,810
Oh!

4855
03:25:53,070 --> 03:25:53,770
Sorry guys.

4856
03:25:54,090 --> 03:25:54,810
I'm so sorry.

4857
03:25:54,810 --> 03:25:55,730
I'm so sorry.

4858
03:25:56,210 --> 03:25:57,490
I can't stop it.

4859
03:25:57,550 --> 03:25:58,550
I'm addicted to the...

4860
03:25:58,550 --> 03:26:00,210
I'm addicted to the balls.

4861
03:26:01,710 --> 03:26:05,670
I'm addicted to the bing bong bing when I get jackpot!

4862
03:26:07,550 --> 03:26:08,730
Kinda looks like a wisp.

4863
03:26:10,950 --> 03:26:12,090
I can see it.

4864
03:26:12,930 --> 03:26:14,330
Oh gosh, that scared me.

4865
03:26:17,590 --> 03:26:18,830
Let's go to my room.

4866
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:24,140
And we'll sleep...

4867
03:26:24,140 --> 03:26:25,200
Ugh, I keep doing this.

4868
03:26:25,280 --> 03:26:25,660
Locked.

4869
03:26:25,920 --> 03:26:26,460
I know.

4870
03:26:28,680 --> 03:26:30,540
We'll sleep until 1am.

4871
03:26:36,380 --> 03:26:37,060
Uh...

4872
03:26:38,020 --> 03:26:38,700
1am.

4873
03:26:42,470 --> 03:26:43,150
Hello?

4874
03:26:44,290 --> 03:26:46,830
So they put my Nancy Drew on the...

4875
03:26:46,830 --> 03:26:48,390
That's exactly how I wrote it.

4876
03:26:48,490 --> 03:26:49,590
Was that an explosion?

4877
03:26:50,070 --> 03:26:51,010
What the hell?

4878
03:26:51,010 --> 03:26:52,330
What the hell was that?

4879
03:26:52,730 --> 03:26:53,610
To

4880
03:26:59,680 --> 03:27:00,260
the explosion.

4881
03:27:24,540 --> 03:27:25,420
To the explosion.

4882
03:27:25,420 --> 03:27:25,760
Suki.

4883
03:27:26,100 --> 03:27:27,160
Suki, tate.

4884
03:27:27,320 --> 03:27:28,440
Suki, tate.

4885
03:27:30,660 --> 03:27:32,960
Oh god, it's horrifying.

4886
03:27:33,860 --> 03:27:35,120
Oh, it's even worse.

4887
03:27:37,020 --> 03:27:39,320
Experience the Bavarian Alps.

4888
03:27:40,260 --> 03:27:41,140
Greece.

4889
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:43,000
Dread Isles.

4890
03:27:43,280 --> 03:27:43,920
Shark diving.

4891
03:27:44,320 --> 03:27:44,820
Fun.

4892
03:27:47,220 --> 03:27:48,920
We are being so nosy.

4893
03:27:50,900 --> 03:27:52,080
Oh my god.

4894
03:27:52,380 --> 03:27:53,380
What's up, cat?

4895
03:27:56,240 --> 03:27:57,280
Suki, tate.

4896
03:27:57,520 --> 03:27:57,920
Tate.

4897
03:28:03,300 --> 03:28:04,460
Oh my god.

4898
03:28:05,520 --> 03:28:06,180
Okay.

4899
03:28:06,460 --> 03:28:06,760
Okay.

4900
03:28:06,980 --> 03:28:07,300
Okay.

4901
03:28:07,640 --> 03:28:07,840
Okay.

4902
03:28:09,190 --> 03:28:10,790
Suki, who's a good girl?

4903
03:28:10,790 --> 03:28:10,910
Girl.

4904
03:28:12,130 --> 03:28:13,630
I'd better get back to the case.

4905
03:28:14,070 --> 03:28:14,550
Okay.

4906
03:28:15,610 --> 03:28:17,150
Um, let me say it real quick.

4907
03:28:17,990 --> 03:28:19,850
Looks like I'll need a password.

4908
03:28:22,250 --> 03:28:23,770
What would the password be?

4909
03:28:27,130 --> 03:28:27,290
Wait.

4910
03:28:32,310 --> 03:28:32,790
Uh...

4911
03:28:32,790 --> 03:28:34,890
What would the password be?

4912
03:28:36,610 --> 03:28:37,450
Suki?

4913
03:28:38,050 --> 03:28:38,890
Suki?

4914
03:28:38,890 --> 03:28:39,750
But it's so long.

4915
03:28:41,830 --> 03:28:42,670
Oh.

4916
03:28:45,710 --> 03:28:46,870
Suki, tate?

4917
03:28:47,250 --> 03:28:48,310
Minto, tate.

4918
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:01,880
Suki, tate.

4919
03:29:02,560 --> 03:29:03,640
Suki, tate.

4920
03:29:03,640 --> 03:29:04,900
That's all she knows in Japanese.

4921
03:29:05,140 --> 03:29:05,640
Suki, tate.

4922
03:29:06,700 --> 03:29:07,380
Oh, where's ta?

4923
03:29:09,060 --> 03:29:09,380
Ta?

4924
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:11,040
Oh, ta, tate.

4925
03:29:11,840 --> 03:29:12,520
Tate.

4926
03:29:15,940 --> 03:29:16,620
Tate.

4927
03:29:16,780 --> 03:29:16,900
Tate.

4928
03:29:17,260 --> 03:29:17,740
Tate.

4929
03:29:20,080 --> 03:29:22,120
What about what we wrote in earlier?

4930
03:29:22,900 --> 03:29:23,840
Nancy Drew?

4931
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:28,900
Nancy Drew?

4932
03:29:30,580 --> 03:29:32,820
What a horrifying wallpaper, even.

4933
03:29:34,720 --> 03:29:36,100
Oh, what could it be?

4934
03:29:40,300 --> 03:29:40,940
Stop!

4935
03:29:46,060 --> 03:29:47,640
Oh, I thought I'd...

4936
03:29:48,500 --> 03:29:50,200
I thought I'd get him while he was asleep.

4937
03:29:54,020 --> 03:29:54,660
Uh...

4938
03:30:00,990 --> 03:30:01,490
Uh...

4939
03:30:01,490 --> 03:30:03,330
Maybe in Rentaro?

4940
03:30:09,170 --> 03:30:09,670
Hmm...

4941
03:30:09,670 --> 03:30:11,510
There's probably a clue somewhere on the desk.

4942
03:30:11,630 --> 03:30:12,310
Check behind me.

4943
03:30:13,050 --> 03:30:13,350
Oh!

4944
03:30:16,450 --> 03:30:16,950
Wait...

4945
03:30:18,610 --> 03:30:20,430
I don't think I can check behind me.

4946
03:30:20,890 --> 03:30:21,350
Oh, wait!

4947
03:30:21,450 --> 03:30:21,870
Yes, I can!

4948
03:30:23,210 --> 03:30:24,090
What is this?

4949
03:30:26,210 --> 03:30:28,150
Oh, it's one of these types of puzzles!

4950
03:30:31,470 --> 03:30:33,380
Wait, if I move it around, is it...

4951
03:30:36,570 --> 03:30:37,070
Oh!

4952
03:30:38,690 --> 03:30:39,190
Wait...

4953
03:30:40,750 --> 03:30:41,690
Okay, hold on.

4954
03:30:43,770 --> 03:30:45,750
So, if I move like this...

4955
03:30:46,260 --> 03:30:47,750
Okay, what about...

4956
03:30:48,770 --> 03:30:49,270
Okay...

4957
03:30:50,130 --> 03:30:52,610
Oh, this one's not any different, huh?

4958
03:30:53,510 --> 03:30:54,050
Oh...

4959
03:30:56,930 --> 03:30:58,010
That one only...

4960
03:30:58,010 --> 03:30:58,410
Wait...

4961
03:31:01,690 --> 03:31:02,770
Am I stupid?

4962
03:31:03,010 --> 03:31:03,550
Why...

4963
03:31:03,550 --> 03:31:04,410
Is it not moving?

4964
03:31:07,270 --> 03:31:08,230
I think we're...

4965
03:31:08,230 --> 03:31:09,230
Maybe we're missing one, no?

4966
03:31:12,240 --> 03:31:13,450
Yeah, we're missing red.

4967
03:31:14,250 --> 03:31:15,190
Okay, hold on.

4968
03:31:15,190 --> 03:31:16,210
Okay...

4969
03:31:20,640 --> 03:31:21,260
KrollmeisterCard3000.

4970
03:31:21,660 --> 03:31:24,460
Having difficulty remembering all those number security codes?

4971
03:31:24,640 --> 03:31:25,420
Worry no more!

4972
03:31:25,620 --> 03:31:27,040
Introducing the KrollmeisterCard3000.

4973
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:32,420
The latest in state-of-the-art keycard security systems.

4974
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:37,880
Our system uses an 8x8 grid with a unique colored entry code designed by the user.

4975
03:31:40,180 --> 03:31:45,320
The colors are then split and encoded onto 5 keycards by our team of specialists.

4976
03:31:46,640 --> 03:31:49,940
With extra squares on each card for added security.

4977
03:31:50,380 --> 03:31:59,360
To open the secured compartment, place the keycards in the slots in the correct layering order and rotate their displays until they match the entry code pattern.

4978
03:32:02,200 --> 03:32:02,800
Okay...

4979
03:32:03,980 --> 03:32:05,660
So yeah, we are missing one.

4980
03:32:05,660 --> 03:32:07,280
But I can rotate it?

4981
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:08,320
Or...

4982
03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:09,280
Oh!

4983
03:32:11,600 --> 03:32:12,520
I see!

4984
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:13,600
Okay...

4985
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:14,900
Oh, so it's like a double.

4986
03:32:15,240 --> 03:32:18,740
You have to first get it in the order and then also rotate it in the correct way.

4987
03:32:19,280 --> 03:32:20,140
Okay, interesting.

4988
03:32:23,120 --> 03:32:25,740
But that doesn't help us with the TV...

4989
03:32:25,740 --> 03:32:27,200
With the computer.

4990
03:32:27,640 --> 03:32:28,300
Oh god!

4991
03:32:28,660 --> 03:32:29,140
Sookies!

4992
03:32:29,140 --> 03:32:29,760
Woah!

4993
03:32:30,540 --> 03:32:30,900
Woah!

4994
03:32:34,740 --> 03:32:35,960
I know, right?

4995
03:32:36,120 --> 03:32:37,100
The English...

4996
03:32:37,100 --> 03:32:37,760
Instructions.

4997
03:32:37,880 --> 03:32:38,380
Thank goodness.

4998
03:32:40,200 --> 03:32:40,600
Suki!

4999
03:32:41,020 --> 03:32:42,060
Who's a good girl?

5000
03:32:42,400 --> 03:32:42,920
Suki!

5001
03:32:43,540 --> 03:32:44,120
Suki!

5002
03:32:44,440 --> 03:32:44,760
Tate!

5003
03:32:51,370 --> 03:32:51,850
Okay.

5004
03:32:52,830 --> 03:32:53,310
What

5005
03:32:56,690 --> 03:32:58,010
could the password be?

5006
03:33:02,110 --> 03:33:03,550
I can't think of anything.

5007
03:33:04,470 --> 03:33:06,730
Right now, unless I like...

5008
03:33:06,730 --> 03:33:08,330
Oh, we can go in here too!

5009
03:33:09,430 --> 03:33:11,630
I'm snoopin', I'm snoopin'.

5010
03:33:11,630 --> 03:33:13,970
He's building Metal Gear at this very moment!

5011
03:33:16,390 --> 03:33:18,150
Uh, nothing that I can take.

5012
03:33:20,330 --> 03:33:20,810
Hmm...

5013
03:33:21,470 --> 03:33:23,250
Nothing... that I can take.

5014
03:33:32,540 --> 03:33:33,020
Hmm...

5015
03:33:33,020 --> 03:33:34,280
Well, what was that article?

5016
03:33:34,500 --> 03:33:35,400
Maybe it's like this.

5017
03:33:36,560 --> 03:33:38,380
Oh, it doesn't have a date on it or anything.

5018
03:33:40,120 --> 03:33:40,600
Um...

5019
03:33:42,520 --> 03:33:43,080
Hmm...

5020
03:33:49,240 --> 03:33:49,800
Hmm...

5021
03:33:54,280 --> 03:33:54,840
Hmm...

5022
03:33:57,730 --> 03:33:59,210
Is there anything in the ashes now?

5023
03:33:59,430 --> 03:33:59,590
No?

5024
03:34:00,090 --> 03:34:02,890
But there's so many little details, like this being...

5025
03:34:02,890 --> 03:34:05,050
...off at night, things like that.

5026
03:34:07,770 --> 03:34:08,710
Oh, what's this?

5027
03:34:09,130 --> 03:34:10,590
Ghost stories of Japan!

5028
03:34:12,730 --> 03:34:13,590
Oh, Okiku!

5029
03:34:15,970 --> 03:34:16,490
Ooh...

5030
03:34:16,490 --> 03:34:24,090
Near the gates of Himeji Castle is an ancient well set to be haunted by the ghost of a heartbroken woman named Okiku!

5031
03:34:25,670 --> 03:34:27,970
Yeah, she counts in the well, you guys.

5032
03:34:27,970 --> 03:34:32,730
Before her death, Okiku was a beautiful servant who worked for a respected samurai.

5033
03:34:33,110 --> 03:34:39,330
The samurai quickly fell in love with Okiku, but she had no interest in her rich and powerful employer.

5034
03:34:39,670 --> 03:34:46,230
The samurai soon grew tired of Okiku's spurning of his advances and concocted a plan to win her affections.

5035
03:34:48,430 --> 03:34:52,850
Okiku was tricked into believing that she had broken one of the samurai's ten prized plates.

5036
03:34:53,250 --> 03:34:58,890
Fearing for her life, Okiku told the samurai what had happened, begging for his mercy and forgiveness.

5037
03:34:58,890 --> 03:35:02,510
The samurai agreed to spare her life in exchange for her love.

5038
03:35:02,670 --> 03:35:06,770
When Okiku refused, she was thrown into the Himeji Castle well to drown!

5039
03:35:07,450 --> 03:35:15,430
According to legend, Okiku's betrayal was so great and her grief so strong that her spirit cannot leave the dark confines of the well.

5040
03:35:15,430 --> 03:35:17,870
Well, at least not during the day.

5041
03:35:18,270 --> 03:35:23,730
At night, it's said that her spirit springs forth from the well and calls out...

5042
03:35:24,430 --> 03:35:24,870
One...

5043
03:35:25,430 --> 03:35:25,850
Two...

5044
03:35:26,430 --> 03:35:26,770
Three...

5045
03:35:27,430 --> 03:35:27,810
Four...

5046
03:35:28,430 --> 03:35:28,850
Five...

5047
03:35:29,430 --> 03:35:29,930
Six...

5048
03:35:29,930 --> 03:35:30,890
Seven...

5049
03:35:31,430 --> 03:35:31,770
Eight...

5050
03:35:32,390 --> 03:35:32,710
Nine...

5051
03:35:32,710 --> 03:35:35,970
Before being pulled back down the well by an unseen force.

5052
03:35:36,710 --> 03:35:44,730
The spirit's counting has led many to believe that Okiku is forever trapped in that dreadful moment when she discovered the samurai's missing plate.

5053
03:35:44,730 --> 03:35:47,850
Knowing that its absence would cost her life.

5054
03:35:48,350 --> 03:35:54,250
Some say Okiku's ghost was finally released from the well when a neighbor loudly called out, Ten!

5055
03:35:54,710 --> 03:35:56,350
During her nightly haunting.

5056
03:35:56,970 --> 03:36:06,190
Other less optimistic tellings say that her spirit is still trapped within the well, forever living out the terrible last moments of her betrayal.

5057
03:36:09,010 --> 03:36:09,770
Spooky.

5058
03:36:11,090 --> 03:36:14,990
It's like the most famous ghost story in Japan probably.

5059
03:36:20,280 --> 03:36:21,680
I'm scared to go in here.

5060
03:36:24,160 --> 03:36:24,680
Um...

5061
03:36:27,870 --> 03:36:29,630
I went the wrong way but that's fine.

5062
03:36:42,160 --> 03:36:42,680
Um...

5063
03:36:42,680 --> 03:36:43,400
Trying to think.

5064
03:36:44,300 --> 03:36:45,280
It's already 2am!

5065
03:36:47,180 --> 03:36:48,480
What could the past...

5066
03:36:48,480 --> 03:36:50,240
Also, where is William-sama?

5067
03:36:55,070 --> 03:36:56,210
The Yurei manga.

5068
03:36:56,350 --> 03:36:56,630
Oh yeah.

5069
03:36:57,030 --> 03:36:58,170
We haven't read that, did we?

5070
03:36:58,310 --> 03:36:58,470
Oh!

5071
03:36:58,650 --> 03:36:58,830
Whoa!

5072
03:37:02,190 --> 03:37:02,670
Yurei...

5073
03:37:03,170 --> 03:37:03,650
Lee...

5074
03:37:03,650 --> 03:37:04,610
Get on my nerves.

5075
03:37:06,230 --> 03:37:07,670
Starring Koji and Kit.

5076
03:37:08,830 --> 03:37:10,250
What are we doing today, Kit?

5077
03:37:10,570 --> 03:37:11,270
Ghost hunting.

5078
03:37:11,890 --> 03:37:12,170
Gulp!

5079
03:37:12,170 --> 03:37:14,690
Can't we just go fox hunting instead?

5080
03:37:15,290 --> 03:37:18,190
How many times do I have to explain why that's not funny?

5081
03:37:18,390 --> 03:37:19,070
Wait, are we...

5082
03:37:19,070 --> 03:37:20,130
So it's left to right.

5083
03:37:20,150 --> 03:37:21,050
It's not a real...

5084
03:37:21,050 --> 03:37:22,430
Manga, you guys.

5085
03:37:24,270 --> 03:37:25,370
Well, here we are.

5086
03:37:25,610 --> 03:37:27,190
Go ahead and open the door, Kit.

5087
03:37:27,530 --> 03:37:31,090
I'll let you get the door since you're the one with opposable thumbs.

5088
03:37:31,830 --> 03:37:33,530
Solicitors will be slimed?

5089
03:37:34,510 --> 03:37:35,490
No ghosts here!

5090
03:37:35,610 --> 03:37:36,250
Let's head home!

5091
03:37:36,710 --> 03:37:37,610
Scared, Koji.

5092
03:37:37,610 --> 03:37:38,550
No.

5093
03:37:39,070 --> 03:37:40,610
It's just that we came here...

5094
03:37:40,610 --> 03:37:41,670
Came to find a ghost.

5095
03:37:41,870 --> 03:37:43,530
And since there are no ghosts...

5096
03:37:43,530 --> 03:37:44,810
Hey, guys.

5097
03:37:45,370 --> 03:37:46,030
What's up?

5098
03:37:46,050 --> 03:37:49,810
Recording the sight of a haunting might actually be a really good idea.

5099
03:37:50,170 --> 03:37:51,550
I should look into that.

5100
03:37:52,110 --> 03:37:52,470
What?

5101
03:37:52,630 --> 03:37:53,550
What are you talking about?

5102
03:37:54,590 --> 03:37:54,970
Ahem.

5103
03:37:55,190 --> 03:37:56,710
Since there are no ghosts...

5104
03:37:56,710 --> 03:37:57,030
What?

5105
03:37:57,430 --> 03:38:00,130
I'm totally haunting this house.

5106
03:38:01,430 --> 03:38:04,090
We should just get back to the car and...

5107
03:38:05,210 --> 03:38:06,110
Okay, fine.

5108
03:38:06,110 --> 03:38:09,150
This house isn't haunted by just any ghost.

5109
03:38:09,270 --> 03:38:10,290
Ayure lives here.

5110
03:38:10,590 --> 03:38:11,110
Beep, beep.

5111
03:38:12,170 --> 03:38:15,410
That's one of those sassy but friendly ghosts that grants wishes, right?

5112
03:38:16,130 --> 03:38:16,430
No.

5113
03:38:17,490 --> 03:38:17,970
Beep.

5114
03:38:19,090 --> 03:38:19,390
Hehehehe.

5115
03:38:20,270 --> 03:38:24,450
Ayure is a vengeful spirit of a person who died tragically.

5116
03:38:24,770 --> 03:38:28,170
They have unfinished business to take care of before they can rest.

5117
03:38:28,630 --> 03:38:29,270
Just like me.

5118
03:38:31,090 --> 03:38:31,390
True.

5119
03:38:31,390 --> 03:38:33,930
I've got like a million thing...

5120
03:38:33,930 --> 03:38:36,030
Things on my plate right now.

5121
03:38:36,590 --> 03:38:39,890
We can't help the yure if we don't know why she wants revenge.

5122
03:38:42,190 --> 03:38:43,090
Help the yure?

5123
03:38:43,350 --> 03:38:44,690
You want to help a ghost?

5124
03:38:45,510 --> 03:38:48,750
It's for this sort of scavenger hunt I'm doing with friends.

5125
03:38:51,590 --> 03:38:53,970
I was ready to party!

5126
03:38:55,050 --> 03:38:55,610
Yipes!

5127
03:38:56,490 --> 03:38:56,630
Later.

5128
03:38:57,530 --> 03:38:57,930
More tea?

5129
03:38:58,430 --> 03:38:59,350
Uh, no thanks.

5130
03:38:59,730 --> 03:39:00,130
Tea?

5131
03:39:00,410 --> 03:39:01,690
Is that what this is?

5132
03:39:01,910 --> 03:39:02,790
I mean, yes!

5133
03:39:02,830 --> 03:39:03,490
More tea please!

5134
03:39:04,190 --> 03:39:05,490
I'll have all the tea!

5135
03:39:05,870 --> 03:39:06,510
Hooray for tea!

5136
03:39:07,070 --> 03:39:07,430
Gulp!

5137
03:39:10,450 --> 03:39:12,730
What the hell did that teach us?

5138
03:39:15,770 --> 03:39:16,410
What?

5139
03:39:19,520 --> 03:39:20,840
What did that teach?

5140
03:39:21,160 --> 03:39:21,500
What?

5141
03:39:23,380 --> 03:39:24,680
What was that?

5142
03:39:24,900 --> 03:39:26,360
Sassy but friendly Minto.

5143
03:39:26,560 --> 03:39:27,980
I wish for your cutest wink.

5144
03:39:37,990 --> 03:39:40,270
It taught you to record the ghost.

5145
03:39:40,770 --> 03:39:41,390
Oh, right.

5146
03:39:41,910 --> 03:39:43,510
Can we use our phone for that?

5147
03:39:45,530 --> 03:39:46,050
Hmm.

5148
03:39:47,550 --> 03:39:49,530
Oh my gosh, what if you could see the ghost in here?

5149
03:39:50,210 --> 03:39:51,430
Wouldn't that be so scary?

5150
03:39:55,410 --> 03:39:57,350
Ahhhh, I still don't know.

5151
03:39:57,790 --> 03:39:58,930
For the computer.

5152
03:40:00,090 --> 03:40:03,390
I wonder if Miwako hid the password somewhere around here.

5153
03:40:04,670 --> 03:40:06,230
But we can't get in!

5154
03:40:06,970 --> 03:40:08,050
Oh, maybe here.

5155
03:40:09,450 --> 03:40:09,970
Uh...

5156
03:40:11,250 --> 03:40:11,690
No...

5157
03:40:11,690 --> 03:40:12,970
Oh wait, uh...

5158
03:40:14,690 --> 03:40:16,250
I don't think they'd have us.

5159
03:40:16,990 --> 03:40:19,410
Who's my favorite robotic cat?

5160
03:40:20,310 --> 03:40:21,910
I'd better get back to the case.

5161
03:40:22,150 --> 03:40:23,130
Call Bess or George?

5162
03:40:23,270 --> 03:40:23,770
We could do that?

5163
03:40:26,030 --> 03:40:27,410
It's too late to call.

5164
03:40:27,610 --> 03:40:28,770
Oh, I can't call right now.

5165
03:40:30,030 --> 03:40:31,310
Everything for the computer for now.

5166
03:40:31,490 --> 03:40:31,810
Oh, okay.

5167
03:40:32,170 --> 03:40:32,290
Cool.

5168
03:40:34,170 --> 03:40:35,090
Time to go to sleep.

5169
03:40:37,710 --> 03:40:40,710
This music is so good at being so creepy.

5170
03:40:43,930 --> 03:40:44,510
Okay.

5171
03:40:45,230 --> 03:40:45,970
Good night.

5172
03:40:46,390 --> 03:40:47,590
Good night, Nancy Drew.

5173
03:40:48,510 --> 03:40:49,710
Good night, Nancy Drew.

5174
03:40:50,350 --> 03:40:51,150
Good night.

5175
03:40:51,810 --> 03:40:53,210
Why can't I just sleep?

5176
03:40:55,990 --> 03:40:57,910
Sleep, Nancy.

5177
03:40:58,930 --> 03:41:00,010
Use the bed.

5178
03:41:03,090 --> 03:41:04,850
I guess I have to set an alarm.

5179
03:41:11,190 --> 03:41:12,270
Before...

5180
03:41:12,610 --> 03:41:13,710
7 PM.

5181
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:21,380
What's happening?

5182
03:41:21,380 --> 03:41:21,400
What's happening?

5183
03:41:23,540 --> 03:41:24,700
Ooooooh!

5184
03:41:26,500 --> 03:41:27,760
Ooooooh!

5185
03:41:32,270 --> 03:41:33,150
Ooooooh!

5186
03:41:35,690 --> 03:41:36,990
What was that?

5187
03:41:38,130 --> 03:41:39,850
Oh, we're gonna go Jack?

5188
03:41:40,850 --> 03:41:41,550
Nancy...

5189
03:41:41,550 --> 03:41:41,950
Oh...

5190
03:41:41,950 --> 03:41:42,130
Ah!

5191
03:41:42,410 --> 03:41:43,230
Oh no!

5192
03:41:43,470 --> 03:41:44,410
The screen tore!

5193
03:41:44,730 --> 03:41:47,110
I better tell Milwaukee about this tomorrow.

5194
03:41:47,450 --> 03:41:48,790
I didn't expect it to...

5195
03:41:48,790 --> 03:41:49,270
To...

5196
03:41:49,270 --> 03:41:49,830
To...

5197
03:41:49,830 --> 03:41:51,070
To open by itself.

5198
03:41:52,030 --> 03:41:54,150
It must have just been my imagination.

5199
03:41:54,710 --> 03:41:56,970
I should try to get some more sleep.

5200
03:41:57,470 --> 03:41:58,870
Am I gonna get jump scared?

5201
03:41:59,450 --> 03:42:00,070
No?

5202
03:42:00,310 --> 03:42:00,470
Okay.

5203
03:42:01,170 --> 03:42:01,450
Oof!

5204
03:42:04,450 --> 03:42:05,070
Oof!

5205
03:42:06,630 --> 03:42:07,250
Okay...

5206
03:42:07,250 --> 03:42:08,050
Class dismissed!

5207
03:42:14,430 --> 03:42:16,110
It gets me every time.

5208
03:42:20,150 --> 03:42:21,110
The explosion...

5209
03:42:21,110 --> 03:42:21,290
Oh!

5210
03:42:22,410 --> 03:42:23,210
Moshi Moshi.

5211
03:42:23,890 --> 03:42:24,250
Hello.

5212
03:42:25,130 --> 03:42:25,590
Oh, hi Nancy.

5213
03:42:25,890 --> 03:42:28,010
What was the name of the place you're staying at again?

5214
03:42:28,290 --> 03:42:29,650
The Ryokan Hiei.

5215
03:42:29,710 --> 03:42:30,430
Told you!

5216
03:42:30,650 --> 03:42:31,450
Guess you're right.

5217
03:42:31,770 --> 03:42:33,430
What are you two talking about?

5218
03:42:33,690 --> 03:42:38,550
We met this girl at a bento booth at the expo, and she grew up at the Ryokan you're staying at.

5219
03:42:38,750 --> 03:42:38,890
Oh, cool.

5220
03:42:39,070 --> 03:42:40,270
Pretty crazy coincidence.

5221
03:42:40,270 --> 03:42:42,230
Is her name Yumi?

5222
03:42:42,930 --> 03:42:43,450
That's the one.

5223
03:42:43,670 --> 03:42:45,230
You've got to get down here and meet her.

5224
03:42:45,390 --> 03:42:46,350
She's so much fun.

5225
03:42:46,630 --> 03:42:50,690
She told us all about everyone at the Ryokan, and it sounds like you've got your hands full.

5226
03:42:51,070 --> 03:42:52,390
I should come to meet her.

5227
03:42:52,610 --> 03:42:54,170
I have a few questions.

5228
03:42:54,530 --> 03:42:55,150
Uh-oh.

5229
03:42:55,470 --> 03:42:56,770
Uh-oh what?

5230
03:42:57,390 --> 03:42:59,030
I know that tone of voice.

5231
03:42:59,250 --> 03:43:00,150
Must be the wind, yeah.

5232
03:43:00,230 --> 03:43:00,910
What tone of voice?

5233
03:43:01,330 --> 03:43:02,550
Yep, that's the one.

5234
03:43:03,030 --> 03:43:04,470
What are you talking about?

5235
03:43:04,470 --> 03:43:06,950
You're working a case, aren't you?

5236
03:43:07,750 --> 03:43:08,010
What?

5237
03:43:08,150 --> 03:43:08,450
Maybe.

5238
03:43:09,410 --> 03:43:14,170
I don't know exactly what is going on at the Ryokan, but it's really strange.

5239
03:43:14,850 --> 03:43:15,350
Busted.

5240
03:43:15,690 --> 03:43:15,990
Busted.

5241
03:43:16,270 --> 03:43:17,610
Okay, you got me.

5242
03:43:17,810 --> 03:43:19,810
I may have found a mystery.

5243
03:43:20,050 --> 03:43:20,610
The Ryokan.

5244
03:43:20,750 --> 03:43:21,070
Shocking.

5245
03:43:21,430 --> 03:43:23,250
So, what can we do for you?

5246
03:43:23,490 --> 03:43:24,710
Yeah, what's going on?

5247
03:43:25,750 --> 03:43:26,310
Well...

5248
03:43:26,310 --> 03:43:29,350
I saw something really strange in my room.

5249
03:43:29,590 --> 03:43:30,110
What?

5250
03:43:30,470 --> 03:43:35,470
A shadowy figure showed up in my room, but when I looked out on the balcony, no one was there.

5251
03:43:35,790 --> 03:43:38,630
It was like whoever it was just disappeared.

5252
03:43:39,550 --> 03:43:40,070
Creepy.

5253
03:43:40,390 --> 03:43:40,730
Creepy.

5254
03:43:40,930 --> 03:43:41,650
Okay, that's it.

5255
03:43:41,710 --> 03:43:42,530
We're leaving Japan.

5256
03:43:43,030 --> 03:43:45,170
I'm sure there is a logical explanation.

5257
03:43:45,530 --> 03:43:46,230
Me too.

5258
03:43:46,550 --> 03:43:48,510
I'm just not sure what it is yet.

5259
03:43:48,870 --> 03:43:49,690
The two of you.

5260
03:43:49,790 --> 03:43:56,110
I swear, if we were being chased by a dinosaur, you two would be too busy debating about the fossil record to run away.

5261
03:43:56,110 --> 03:43:57,970
Where is your sense of panic?

5262
03:43:58,330 --> 03:43:59,730
I don't think you have to leave all of Japan.

5263
03:43:59,950 --> 03:44:00,450
It was pretty scary, I admit.

5264
03:44:01,110 --> 03:44:03,230
But I don't believe that someone could just disappear.

5265
03:44:04,090 --> 03:44:04,310
Right.

5266
03:44:04,950 --> 03:44:06,550
Well, you said a shadow figure, right?

5267
03:44:06,950 --> 03:44:09,090
Maybe it was some sort of trick of the light.

5268
03:44:09,270 --> 03:44:09,490
Right.

5269
03:44:09,650 --> 03:44:10,710
That's what I was thinking.

5270
03:44:11,150 --> 03:44:13,390
I'll keep an eye out for something like that.

5271
03:44:14,190 --> 03:44:14,590
Spooky.

5272
03:44:15,090 --> 03:44:15,470
Spooky.

5273
03:44:15,490 --> 03:44:16,030
Anything else?

5274
03:44:17,850 --> 03:44:18,250
Oh.

5275
03:44:18,730 --> 03:44:19,210
Yeah, oh.

5276
03:44:19,690 --> 03:44:22,630
I looked in the mirror, and instead of seeing my reflection, I saw a ghostly image.

5277
03:44:22,810 --> 03:44:28,290
I looked in this mirror, and instead of seeing my reflection, I saw a ghostly image.

5278
03:44:28,690 --> 03:44:29,150
Ugh.

5279
03:44:29,650 --> 03:44:30,090
Creepy.

5280
03:44:30,930 --> 03:44:31,390
Cool.

5281
03:44:32,750 --> 03:44:35,710
Actually, I'm going to side with Bess on this one.

5282
03:44:36,230 --> 03:44:38,210
No, I've heard about stuff like this before.

5283
03:44:38,630 --> 03:44:42,470
There's a thing you can do to the glass to throw a false image, but it's a really fussy process.

5284
03:44:42,710 --> 03:44:44,190
It's hard to do without breaking the mirror.

5285
03:44:44,350 --> 03:44:44,570
Oh.

5286
03:44:44,870 --> 03:44:46,370
Yeah, the mirror broke.

5287
03:44:46,370 --> 03:44:49,130
So, do you think it's possible it was rigged?

5288
03:44:49,230 --> 03:44:50,490
It's your sleeper else's demon.

5289
03:44:50,510 --> 03:44:51,710
More possible than the other option.

5290
03:44:53,090 --> 03:44:54,690
Um, how's the expo going?

5291
03:44:54,790 --> 03:44:56,110
How's the expo going, George?

5292
03:44:56,510 --> 03:44:57,590
It's crazy.

5293
03:44:57,850 --> 03:45:00,130
I've never seen so many clever people in one state.

5294
03:45:00,150 --> 03:45:00,790
Thanks, George.

5295
03:45:01,070 --> 03:45:05,670
I'm definitely dealing with a little bit of that small fish, large pond anxiety.

5296
03:45:05,970 --> 03:45:08,690
I'm still trying to get tickets for you, but it's not looking good.

5297
03:45:08,830 --> 03:45:09,210
Oh, no!

5298
03:45:09,270 --> 03:45:09,930
That's okay.

5299
03:45:10,270 --> 03:45:11,030
Thanks for trying.

5300
03:45:11,510 --> 03:45:12,850
Have you seen the robotic cats?

5301
03:45:12,850 --> 03:45:14,870
Have you seen the robotic cats they have here?

5302
03:45:14,870 --> 03:45:15,490
They're terrifying.

5303
03:45:15,610 --> 03:45:16,570
I love those!

5304
03:45:16,870 --> 03:45:20,310
I don't know if they're cute or creepy, but I love them anyway.

5305
03:45:20,770 --> 03:45:21,930
Miwako has one.

5306
03:45:22,110 --> 03:45:24,610
It's cute, but it's a little aggressive.

5307
03:45:24,950 --> 03:45:25,050
Yeah.

5308
03:45:25,290 --> 03:45:26,150
It's in guard mode.

5309
03:45:26,370 --> 03:45:27,670
There's a way to override that.

5310
03:45:27,670 --> 03:45:28,890
Some sort of code word.

5311
03:45:29,530 --> 03:45:29,890
Right.

5312
03:45:30,050 --> 03:45:31,610
I need to figure out what it is.

5313
03:45:31,690 --> 03:45:32,030
Ooh.

5314
03:45:32,510 --> 03:45:35,350
I bet if I check around the expo, I can find someone who knows.

5315
03:45:35,610 --> 03:45:36,950
That would be amazing.

5316
03:45:36,950 --> 03:45:37,390
Awesome.

5317
03:45:37,550 --> 03:45:37,870
Wait.

5318
03:45:38,350 --> 03:45:38,570
Anytime.

5319
03:45:39,030 --> 03:45:39,950
Need anything else?

5320
03:45:40,410 --> 03:45:41,430
I'll let you go.

5321
03:45:41,810 --> 03:45:42,530
Talk to you later.

5322
03:45:43,150 --> 03:45:51,590
If all of them had the same way to disengage it, then what's the point of setting up a guard mode?

5323
03:45:53,930 --> 03:45:57,210
Be like, oh yeah, I know how to get rid of it.

5324
03:46:00,510 --> 03:46:02,230
Why would they know the password?

5325
03:46:02,890 --> 03:46:03,990
What time is it now?

5326
03:46:09,530 --> 03:46:13,230
Is there anything we have to do?

5327
03:46:13,910 --> 03:46:14,990
Oh yeah, that's right.

5328
03:46:15,290 --> 03:46:17,630
I tore one of the screens in my room.

5329
03:46:17,870 --> 03:46:19,170
I'm really sorry.

5330
03:46:19,930 --> 03:46:21,430
Do not worry, Nancy-san.

5331
03:46:21,690 --> 03:46:23,050
This happens often.

5332
03:46:23,490 --> 03:46:24,410
Very easy to fix.

5333
03:46:24,590 --> 03:46:26,330
Just a little steam to loosen the glue.

5334
03:46:27,010 --> 03:46:29,330
I'll have Lentalo take care of it immediately.

5335
03:46:29,330 --> 03:46:30,570
Thank you.

5336
03:46:30,950 --> 03:46:31,150
Thanks.

5337
03:46:32,210 --> 03:46:35,610
When I tore the screen, I think I saw someone on my balcony.

5338
03:46:35,730 --> 03:46:36,270
It's kind of bad at computer security.

5339
03:46:36,390 --> 03:46:36,610
Right.

5340
03:46:37,390 --> 03:46:38,890
It's nothing to worry about.

5341
03:46:39,430 --> 03:46:42,030
The screens really distort things sometimes.

5342
03:46:42,370 --> 03:46:44,130
I'm sure it was just your imagination.

5343
03:46:45,350 --> 03:46:45,970
Um...

5344
03:46:45,970 --> 03:46:46,250
No.

5345
03:46:46,930 --> 03:46:48,310
I don't think...

5346
03:46:48,310 --> 03:46:48,790
Maybe you're...

5347
03:46:48,790 --> 03:46:48,890
No.

5348
03:46:49,030 --> 03:46:50,650
It wasn't my imagination.

5349
03:46:51,150 --> 03:46:56,050
I saw someone walking on my balcony, and then she just disappeared.

5350
03:46:56,050 --> 03:46:57,870
You're seeing things.

5351
03:46:58,250 --> 03:46:59,710
It is just your imagination.

5352
03:47:00,130 --> 03:47:02,370
There is no war in Ba Sing Se.

5353
03:47:02,790 --> 03:47:03,830
She's creepy.

5354
03:47:04,090 --> 03:47:05,150
I'll stop bugging you now.

5355
03:47:05,410 --> 03:47:05,750
Bye.

5356
03:47:06,210 --> 03:47:06,490
Bye.

5357
03:47:07,410 --> 03:47:09,090
Where's the convention at, I wonder?

5358
03:47:09,210 --> 03:47:11,010
Cause we gotta go talk to Yumi, probably.

5359
03:47:12,610 --> 03:47:13,350
Um, hello.

5360
03:47:13,630 --> 03:47:15,090
Did he even fix the mirror?

5361
03:47:15,930 --> 03:47:16,250
Hello?

5362
03:47:17,170 --> 03:47:17,690
Uh...

5363
03:47:17,690 --> 03:47:20,450
Is Sugi supposed to be so...protective?

5364
03:47:20,810 --> 03:47:21,870
Great A gaslighting.

5365
03:47:21,870 --> 03:47:22,430
Took a swipe at you, huh?

5366
03:47:23,110 --> 03:47:24,450
Oh, that's one of her mods.

5367
03:47:24,450 --> 03:47:25,870
Don't take it personally.

5368
03:47:26,350 --> 03:47:28,030
It's actually really clever.

5369
03:47:28,230 --> 03:47:28,530
Uh-huh.

5370
03:47:28,650 --> 03:47:33,090
There are these command words you say, and then Sugi changes into that mode.

5371
03:47:33,670 --> 03:47:36,890
She'll be protective, or aloof, or silly.

5372
03:47:37,590 --> 03:47:37,990
Oh, I...

5373
03:47:37,990 --> 03:47:38,150
Really?

5374
03:47:38,390 --> 03:47:39,710
Do you know the commands?

5375
03:47:40,070 --> 03:47:40,970
I did.

5376
03:47:41,790 --> 03:47:44,190
Can't remember where I put that piece of paper.

5377
03:47:44,410 --> 03:47:44,790
Hmm.

5378
03:47:44,990 --> 03:47:46,210
Okay, it's a piece of paper somewhere.

5379
03:47:46,210 --> 03:47:47,510
I'm back for more nonograms.

5380
03:47:47,710 --> 03:47:48,450
Here you go.

5381
03:47:48,670 --> 03:47:49,070
Thank you.

5382
03:47:50,790 --> 03:47:51,730
Alright, cool.

5383
03:47:51,870 --> 03:47:52,310
Talk to you later.

5384
03:47:52,330 --> 03:47:53,090
I'll talk to you later.

5385
03:47:53,090 --> 03:47:54,370
Catch you around.

5386
03:47:54,710 --> 03:47:56,690
I feel like that's really bad though, no?

5387
03:47:56,930 --> 03:47:57,350
Like...

5388
03:47:57,350 --> 03:48:00,430
What if it malfunctions and it just scratches you all the time?

5389
03:48:01,030 --> 03:48:02,590
Piece of paper, huh?

5390
03:48:03,090 --> 03:48:04,330
Piece of paper, huh?

5391
03:48:10,300 --> 03:48:10,860
Maybe...

5392
03:48:10,860 --> 03:48:12,860
We can go see Grandma too.

5393
03:48:15,100 --> 03:48:16,860
Ask her about some stuff.

5394
03:48:17,760 --> 03:48:18,320
Grandma!

5395
03:48:21,920 --> 03:48:24,380
Oh, what do you have today?

5396
03:48:24,620 --> 03:48:24,920
Nanasi!

5397
03:48:25,120 --> 03:48:28,780
Today, I have a very important lesson.

5398
03:48:29,240 --> 03:48:31,280
We will learn origami.

5399
03:48:31,580 --> 03:48:32,040
Origami!

5400
03:48:32,040 --> 03:48:32,560
Great!

5401
03:48:32,960 --> 03:48:33,720
Let's get started!

5402
03:48:34,340 --> 03:48:35,100
Origami!

5403
03:48:35,480 --> 03:48:38,320
Origami has been around in many forms for centuries.

5404
03:48:39,360 --> 03:48:44,480
Master Yoshizawa brought the art back before it could disappear.

5405
03:48:45,480 --> 03:48:48,580
There is a grave danger, Nancy-san.

5406
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:50,580
She gets Nancy sometimes!

5407
03:48:51,040 --> 03:48:56,820
If the whole world forgets a thing or a person, then it is gone.

5408
03:48:57,420 --> 03:48:57,760
Forever.

5409
03:48:58,600 --> 03:48:59,900
What do you mean by that?

5410
03:49:00,100 --> 03:49:00,320
Nope.

5411
03:49:00,320 --> 03:49:04,600
I have for you here a selection of origami patterns.

5412
03:49:04,900 --> 03:49:06,820
I'm gonna become- That's Nancy's next path.

5413
03:49:06,820 --> 03:49:08,240
A few steps away from the last step.

5414
03:49:08,400 --> 03:49:09,400
She becomes the origami.

5415
03:49:09,400 --> 03:49:13,980
You must simply match the pattern to the completed design.

5416
03:49:16,020 --> 03:49:16,620
Okay.

5417
03:49:18,100 --> 03:49:18,700
Oh!

5418
03:49:21,640 --> 03:49:23,380
What do you guys want to make?

5419
03:49:24,840 --> 03:49:25,640
Wait, what?

5420
03:49:25,840 --> 03:49:28,760
Oh, we match- Oh, we don't get to make it?

5421
03:49:30,360 --> 03:49:31,980
Aww, that's so lame.

5422
03:49:34,880 --> 03:49:35,600
Oh, wait.

5423
03:49:35,820 --> 03:49:36,140
Hold on.

5424
03:49:36,680 --> 03:49:37,480
What is this?

5425
03:49:38,020 --> 03:49:39,320
So I have to figure out...

5426
03:49:40,640 --> 03:49:42,880
What design goes to what thing?

5427
03:49:43,040 --> 03:49:43,840
This is kind of weird.

5428
03:49:45,840 --> 03:49:48,260
I thought I was gonna fold it.

5429
03:49:50,320 --> 03:49:52,720
So I imagine this is that, probably.

5430
03:49:54,220 --> 03:49:56,160
And then this is probably that.

5431
03:49:56,160 --> 03:49:56,440
What?

5432
03:49:56,960 --> 03:49:57,620
What?

5433
03:49:57,660 --> 03:49:58,220
This is weird.

5434
03:49:59,340 --> 03:50:00,440
This is...

5435
03:50:00,440 --> 03:50:01,160
Bizarre.

5436
03:50:05,080 --> 03:50:05,740
What?

5437
03:50:06,160 --> 03:50:06,340
What?

5438
03:50:06,700 --> 03:50:07,260
What?

5439
03:50:07,520 --> 03:50:09,060
These are...

5440
03:50:09,060 --> 03:50:09,560
Huh?

5441
03:50:12,280 --> 03:50:15,140
I can't even tell which one is supposed to be the bird.

5442
03:50:20,380 --> 03:50:21,660
Oh, maybe this one.

5443
03:50:22,240 --> 03:50:23,500
Because you fold it in half.

5444
03:50:23,500 --> 03:50:24,140
It's skinny.

5445
03:50:29,740 --> 03:50:31,620
What does this diagram mean?

5446
03:50:36,930 --> 03:50:37,650
Oh, wait.

5447
03:50:37,930 --> 03:50:38,530
Oh, wait.

5448
03:50:38,790 --> 03:50:39,510
Maybe like that.

5449
03:50:39,710 --> 03:50:41,230
Because they're supposed to be the little leggies.

5450
03:50:41,350 --> 03:50:41,530
Wait.

5451
03:50:41,930 --> 03:50:42,770
I can't tell.

5452
03:50:43,590 --> 03:50:44,990
This is so strange.

5453
03:50:46,350 --> 03:50:46,990
No.

5454
03:50:47,390 --> 03:50:49,030
Do it the right way.

5455
03:50:49,430 --> 03:50:50,810
You're not teaching me!

5456
03:50:51,490 --> 03:50:52,310
Oh, wait.

5457
03:51:04,090 --> 03:51:05,810
She's not saying anything anymore.

5458
03:51:10,620 --> 03:51:11,820
Hello, Nancy-san.

5459
03:51:12,120 --> 03:51:14,120
I'd like to try learning origami again.

5460
03:51:17,160 --> 03:51:19,280
I don't think I'm learning anything.

5461
03:51:21,040 --> 03:51:22,080
This sucks.

5462
03:51:22,440 --> 03:51:23,700
You're the worst teacher ever.

5463
03:51:24,120 --> 03:51:25,740
This is why you don't do your lessons.

5464
03:51:30,470 --> 03:51:32,890
So this one's probably the bird.

5465
03:51:35,630 --> 03:51:36,270
Then...

5466
03:51:36,270 --> 03:51:37,350
Do it right.

5467
03:51:37,870 --> 03:51:39,710
I don't remember what I did before.

5468
03:51:40,010 --> 03:51:40,270
Oh, no.

5469
03:51:42,310 --> 03:51:43,810
Is this the fish?

5470
03:51:44,370 --> 03:51:44,650
Probably.

5471
03:51:44,650 --> 03:51:44,810
Probably.

5472
03:51:47,390 --> 03:51:47,990
Oh.

5473
03:51:50,390 --> 03:51:50,990
Oh.

5474
03:51:55,970 --> 03:51:56,570
Oh.

5475
03:51:58,490 --> 03:51:59,910
Grandma, no, Nancy!

5476
03:52:00,050 --> 03:52:01,050
You must read my mind!

5477
03:52:02,010 --> 03:52:03,990
This one, I feel like, is...

5478
03:52:03,990 --> 03:52:05,290
This one.

5479
03:52:05,650 --> 03:52:08,050
I don't understand what these steps are, though.

5480
03:52:11,130 --> 03:52:13,090
They are perfect.

5481
03:52:13,690 --> 03:52:15,450
Absolutely perfect.

5482
03:52:16,070 --> 03:52:19,050
You have many talents, Nancy-san.

5483
03:52:20,770 --> 03:52:22,150
I should go.

5484
03:52:22,430 --> 03:52:23,590
I'll talk to you later.

5485
03:52:24,150 --> 03:52:26,530
Please visit again, Nancy-san.

5486
03:52:33,060 --> 03:52:34,300
Oh, now...

5487
03:52:34,300 --> 03:52:35,960
Oh, so there's one more activity.

5488
03:52:36,340 --> 03:52:37,080
Or two more, maybe.

5489
03:52:38,080 --> 03:52:40,380
Beginner's origami.

5490
03:52:43,770 --> 03:52:44,460
Okay.

5491
03:52:45,160 --> 03:52:46,220
Can I...

5492
03:52:46,220 --> 03:52:46,340
Wait.

5493
03:52:48,040 --> 03:52:50,320
It just teaches you about origami.

5494
03:52:51,720 --> 03:52:52,220
Okay.

5495
03:52:52,220 --> 03:52:52,360
Hi.

5496
03:52:55,000 --> 03:52:55,520
Mmm.

5497
03:52:58,860 --> 03:52:59,960
Anything in here?

5498
03:53:00,620 --> 03:53:01,140
No.

5499
03:53:03,120 --> 03:53:04,460
Hello, Nancy-san.

5500
03:53:04,800 --> 03:53:05,260
Okay.

5501
03:53:05,260 --> 03:53:05,820
I'll let you go.

5502
03:53:06,220 --> 03:53:06,280
I'll let you go.

5503
03:53:06,320 --> 03:53:08,720
Please visit again, Nancy-san.

5504
03:53:10,960 --> 03:53:11,480
Okay.

5505
03:53:12,820 --> 03:53:13,340
Oh.

5506
03:53:13,960 --> 03:53:14,480
Hello?

5507
03:53:14,780 --> 03:53:15,640
Nancy, good news.

5508
03:53:15,900 --> 03:53:18,300
We met Ryuichi, the creator of the Suki Cat.

5509
03:53:18,380 --> 03:53:18,900
What?

5510
03:53:19,040 --> 03:53:22,200
The thing is, he won't give away the secret phrases unless you buy one of the cats.

5511
03:53:22,600 --> 03:53:23,220
Oh, dang.

5512
03:53:23,320 --> 03:53:24,620
Alright, thanks for trying.

5513
03:53:24,780 --> 03:53:25,620
Well, I would hope so, because...

5514
03:53:25,620 --> 03:53:32,040
But then, the guy told George, for such a captivating, beautiful, gorgeous girl, he'd be willing to make an exception.

5515
03:53:32,560 --> 03:53:33,520
You're turning red.

5516
03:53:33,640 --> 03:53:35,100
Nancy, she's turning red!

5517
03:53:35,420 --> 03:53:36,280
Am not!

5518
03:53:36,980 --> 03:53:38,180
Anyway, there's a catch.

5519
03:53:38,480 --> 03:53:41,420
He only shares secrets with the like-minded.

5520
03:53:41,600 --> 03:53:41,840
No.

5521
03:53:41,880 --> 03:53:44,620
He gave me this monster puzzle to solve.

5522
03:53:44,760 --> 03:53:44,920
No.

5523
03:53:44,920 --> 03:53:47,100
But I'm too busy with expo stuff to solve it right now.

5524
03:53:47,720 --> 03:53:49,500
Any chance that you could take a look at it?

5525
03:53:49,820 --> 03:53:50,220
Sure.

5526
03:53:51,400 --> 03:53:54,220
Anything for such a captivating, beautiful...

5527
03:53:55,220 --> 03:53:55,700
Enough!

5528
03:53:56,440 --> 03:53:58,540
I'll send it right over to you at the rear con.

5529
03:53:58,940 --> 03:53:59,080
Okay.

5530
03:53:59,520 --> 03:54:00,280
I'll talk to you later.

5531
03:54:00,640 --> 03:54:01,280
Talk to you later.

5532
03:54:01,780 --> 03:54:02,200
Cool.

5533
03:54:02,700 --> 03:54:03,660
How do I get it?

5534
03:54:06,040 --> 03:54:06,560
Uh...

5535
03:54:06,560 --> 03:54:07,540
Uh...

5536
03:54:07,540 --> 03:54:08,200
Over...

5537
03:54:08,200 --> 03:54:08,640
Here?

5538
03:54:09,080 --> 03:54:09,980
Do you have it?

5539
03:54:12,000 --> 03:54:12,520
Hello?

5540
03:54:12,520 --> 03:54:12,780
Hi!

5541
03:54:13,580 --> 03:54:14,100
Uh...

5542
03:54:14,100 --> 03:54:14,960
I'll let you go.

5543
03:54:15,240 --> 03:54:15,880
See you later.

5544
03:54:16,560 --> 03:54:17,800
Where are you sending it to?

5545
03:54:19,280 --> 03:54:19,680
Um...

5546
03:54:19,680 --> 03:54:20,440
How do I get it?

5547
03:54:23,440 --> 03:54:23,840
Uh...

5548
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:24,240
How do I...

5549
03:54:24,240 --> 03:54:24,880
How do I...

5550
03:54:25,280 --> 03:54:25,680
Save?

5551
03:54:26,020 --> 03:54:26,800
Yeah, we'll save.

5552
03:54:29,220 --> 03:54:29,620
Uh...

5553
03:54:31,200 --> 03:54:32,000
Phone messages?

5554
03:54:34,740 --> 03:54:35,140
No?

5555
03:54:37,780 --> 03:54:38,740
Maybe in my room.

5556
03:54:38,880 --> 03:54:39,680
Oh yeah, maybe, maybe.

5557
03:54:39,680 --> 03:54:41,000
Oh...

5558
03:54:41,000 --> 03:54:41,400
This way.

5559
03:54:42,680 --> 03:54:44,760
This music is so unsettling.

5560
03:54:45,020 --> 03:54:45,880
It's so creepy!

5561
03:54:50,460 --> 03:54:51,180
Uh...

5562
03:54:51,180 --> 03:54:52,080
Monster...

5563
03:54:52,080 --> 03:54:52,220
Oh!

5564
03:54:52,380 --> 03:54:53,600
We have our little org army!

5565
03:54:55,680 --> 03:54:56,400
Uh...

5566
03:54:58,560 --> 03:54:59,280
What?

5567
03:55:02,370 --> 03:55:03,350
How do I...

5568
03:55:03,350 --> 03:55:04,130
How do I...

5569
03:55:05,430 --> 03:55:06,710
Sit in my...

5570
03:55:06,710 --> 03:55:07,310
Suitcase?

5571
03:55:07,490 --> 03:55:08,190
Oh my gosh.

5572
03:55:11,110 --> 03:55:11,450
No...

5573
03:55:12,950 --> 03:55:14,170
Nancy with all her chocolate...

5574
03:55:14,850 --> 03:55:16,370
Has a crippling...

5575
03:55:17,130 --> 03:55:19,090
A crippling sugar addiction.

5576
03:55:21,370 --> 03:55:21,690
Eh?

5577
03:55:24,650 --> 03:55:26,070
Maybe the next day.

5578
03:55:26,670 --> 03:55:27,250
Maybe.

5579
03:55:27,590 --> 03:55:28,390
We'll go to sleep.

5580
03:55:30,230 --> 03:55:31,090
We'll go to sleep.

5581
03:55:31,190 --> 03:55:31,230
We'll go to sleep.

5582
03:55:31,230 --> 03:55:32,290
It's early, but...

5583
03:55:32,290 --> 03:55:32,910
We'll go to sleep.

5584
03:55:35,210 --> 03:55:36,510
Oh wait, why am I doing that?

5585
03:55:36,930 --> 03:55:37,410
Uh...

5586
03:55:39,650 --> 03:55:40,430
It's late.

5587
03:55:40,730 --> 03:55:41,790
I should get to bed.

5588
03:55:45,310 --> 03:55:45,790
Okay.

5589
03:55:48,190 --> 03:55:49,070
Where's that man?

5590
03:55:49,190 --> 03:55:49,810
I don't know.

5591
03:55:52,130 --> 03:55:54,990
I have no idea who that guy is.

5592
03:56:10,970 --> 03:56:11,850
What?

5593
03:56:15,710 --> 03:56:16,150
What?

5594
03:56:16,390 --> 03:56:17,350
Where is it?

5595
03:56:20,930 --> 03:56:22,670
Nothing makes sense!

5596
03:56:25,700 --> 03:56:27,380
Nothing makes sense!

5597
03:56:27,840 --> 03:56:29,080
Oh, it's her boyfriend!

5598
03:56:30,120 --> 03:56:30,600
Wow!

5599
03:56:31,340 --> 03:56:32,060
What a stud!

5600
03:56:34,600 --> 03:56:36,100
Can't talk on my phone now.

5601
03:56:36,300 --> 03:56:36,640
Why not?

5602
03:56:36,940 --> 03:56:38,360
Shouldn't talk on my phone here.

5603
03:56:38,580 --> 03:56:39,040
Oh, okay.

5604
03:56:40,060 --> 03:56:40,540
Uh...

5605
03:56:40,540 --> 03:56:41,760
We'll go outside and talk.

5606
03:56:50,320 --> 03:56:51,660
Nancy, how's it going?

5607
03:56:52,540 --> 03:56:53,680
I should go.

5608
03:56:53,960 --> 03:56:54,820
I'll talk to you later.

5609
03:56:55,500 --> 03:56:55,960
Bye, Nancy!

5610
03:56:58,900 --> 03:56:59,420
Um...

5611
03:56:59,420 --> 03:56:59,700
George?

5612
03:57:03,620 --> 03:57:04,660
Nancy, what's up?

5613
03:57:05,540 --> 03:57:06,520
Where is it?

5614
03:57:06,520 --> 03:57:07,260
I should go.

5615
03:57:07,460 --> 03:57:08,340
I'll talk to you later.

5616
03:57:08,700 --> 03:57:09,620
Talk to you later.

5617
03:57:09,620 --> 03:57:10,200
What?

5618
03:57:12,120 --> 03:57:14,360
I don't know where the expo is.

5619
03:57:14,500 --> 03:57:15,980
So I don't know how to...

5620
03:57:16,480 --> 03:57:17,200
Get to them.

5621
03:57:17,380 --> 03:57:18,300
Is the other...

5622
03:57:18,300 --> 03:57:18,980
Issue.

5623
03:57:20,440 --> 03:57:20,920
Uh...

5624
03:57:20,920 --> 03:57:21,100
Wait.

5625
03:57:21,220 --> 03:57:22,640
Maybe it says in my room?

5626
03:57:22,880 --> 03:57:24,580
Because there was like a thing that's like...

5627
03:57:24,580 --> 03:57:26,260
The expo is happening...

5628
03:57:26,260 --> 03:57:27,480
At this place.

5629
03:57:31,360 --> 03:57:31,840
Here.

5630
03:57:36,480 --> 03:57:36,960
Uh...

5631
03:57:36,960 --> 03:57:37,780
Ah, Matsue!

5632
03:57:38,080 --> 03:57:38,480
Okay.

5633
03:57:38,640 --> 03:57:40,160
Technology of Tomorrow Expo...

5634
03:57:40,160 --> 03:57:40,940
Me... Matsue.

5635
03:57:41,100 --> 03:57:41,960
We'll go to Matsue.

5636
03:57:53,320 --> 03:57:53,840
Okay.

5637
03:57:55,540 --> 03:57:57,680
To the train, to the train, to the train...

5638
03:58:00,600 --> 03:58:01,640
Matsue... Matsue...

5639
03:58:01,640 --> 03:58:03,400
If you see it, yell, there!

5640
03:58:07,120 --> 03:58:08,160
Matsue... Matsue...

5641
03:58:08,160 --> 03:58:10,660
If you see it, say, right there!

5642
03:58:13,380 --> 03:58:13,900
Matsue...

5643
03:58:16,320 --> 03:58:16,820
Matsue...

5644
03:58:16,820 --> 03:58:18,280
Let's see, Mutsu?

5645
03:58:19,200 --> 03:58:19,700
Oh!

5646
03:58:20,000 --> 03:58:20,120
Ah!

5647
03:58:20,480 --> 03:58:20,860
There!

5648
03:58:22,320 --> 03:58:24,180
Dave is from an older game in the series.

5649
03:58:24,200 --> 03:58:25,100
Got it!

5650
03:58:28,100 --> 03:58:29,060
Ah, let's see.

5651
03:58:29,160 --> 03:58:30,600
What's the easiest way to get there?

5652
03:58:42,310 --> 03:58:43,430
Maybe we go...

5653
03:58:43,430 --> 03:58:44,710
Let's see from Kure, actually.

5654
03:58:50,680 --> 03:58:52,210
Oh, we could go to...

5655
03:58:52,210 --> 03:58:53,210
Eww...

5656
03:58:55,410 --> 03:58:56,650
Eww...

5657
03:58:56,650 --> 03:58:57,250
Eww...

5658
03:58:57,250 --> 03:58:57,890
Ugh...

5659
03:58:59,830 --> 03:59:01,370
I don't know...

5660
03:59:01,710 --> 03:59:03,650
What's the easiest way?

5661
03:59:06,750 --> 03:59:08,710
One second, real quick...

5662
03:59:10,690 --> 03:59:12,650
Time to travel all over...

5663
03:59:12,550 --> 03:59:13,170
Japan!

5664
03:59:13,470 --> 03:59:13,870
For real!

5665
03:59:20,430 --> 03:59:22,090
Just walk...

5666
03:59:22,350 --> 03:59:22,970
Um...

5667
03:59:22,970 --> 03:59:23,970
The music disappeared...

5668
03:59:27,050 --> 03:59:27,770
It's...

5669
03:59:31,380 --> 03:59:32,720
Maybe from Fuji...

5670
03:59:35,220 --> 03:59:36,680
Maybe from Fuji...

5671
03:59:39,960 --> 03:59:41,720
But how do I get to Fuji?

5672
03:59:43,740 --> 03:59:45,920
Oh, we can probably go down to...

5673
03:59:45,920 --> 03:59:47,080
Oh no, Tochigi doesn't...

5674
03:59:47,080 --> 03:59:47,700
Oh, yes it does!

5675
03:59:48,000 --> 03:59:49,720
Okay, let's go to Tochigi...

5676
03:59:52,400 --> 03:59:53,160
So, Nagoya...

5677
03:59:54,260 --> 03:59:55,020
Otsu, Aomori...

5678
03:59:55,020 --> 03:59:55,940
Kochi, Tochigi...

5679
03:59:55,940 --> 03:59:57,640
Okay, I won't remember that at all...

5680
03:59:58,640 --> 04:00:00,320
Next to Otsu...

5681
04:00:00,500 --> 04:00:01,200
Next to Otsu...

5682
04:00:03,420 --> 04:00:04,820
Aomori...

5683
04:00:07,800 --> 04:00:09,700
Does this one...

5684
04:00:09,700 --> 04:00:10,640
Connect to yellow?

5685
04:00:12,540 --> 04:00:13,620
Okay, uh...

5686
04:00:14,200 --> 04:00:15,200
Kochi...

5687
04:00:21,100 --> 04:00:22,500
Tochigi...

5688
04:00:23,340 --> 04:00:24,340
Seto...

5689
04:00:27,040 --> 04:00:28,740
Then from there...

5690
04:00:30,320 --> 04:00:30,980
Uh...

5691
04:00:31,710 --> 04:00:32,720
Oh, wait...

5692
04:00:32,720 --> 04:00:33,340
Uh...

5693
04:00:33,340 --> 04:00:34,000
Niigata!

5694
04:00:36,680 --> 04:00:37,340
Fuji!

5695
04:00:38,080 --> 04:00:39,740
This is so crazy...

5696
04:00:41,760 --> 04:00:42,220
Niiga!

5697
04:00:45,520 --> 04:00:46,180
Matsue!

5698
04:00:48,560 --> 04:00:49,900
Okay, but from here...

5699
04:00:49,900 --> 04:00:50,540
We should have a...

5700
04:00:50,540 --> 04:00:51,540
Be able to get to it...

5701
04:00:51,540 --> 04:00:52,240
Immediately, right?

5702
04:00:52,860 --> 04:00:54,010
Yes, okay...

5703
04:00:54,760 --> 04:00:55,880
We did it!

5704
04:00:56,940 --> 04:00:57,600
Whoa...

5705
04:00:57,600 --> 04:00:58,880
Robot cat...

5706
04:01:02,160 --> 04:01:03,780
Virtual Nyao...

5707
04:01:04,320 --> 04:01:05,600
Vacharu Nyao...

5708
04:01:07,540 --> 04:01:09,700
Lifelike movement...

5709
04:01:09,700 --> 04:01:11,120
Real cat noises...

5710
04:01:11,500 --> 04:01:12,900
Programmable commands...

5711
04:01:12,900 --> 04:01:13,880
Teacher cat to sit...

5712
04:01:13,880 --> 04:01:14,200
Stay...

5713
04:01:14,200 --> 04:01:14,520
Guard...

5714
04:01:14,520 --> 04:01:15,260
Groom...

5715
04:01:15,260 --> 04:01:16,020
And more...

5716
04:01:16,020 --> 04:01:16,920
Allergy free...

5717
04:01:16,920 --> 04:01:17,780
No shedding...

5718
04:01:17,780 --> 04:01:18,840
Oh my god...

5719
04:01:18,840 --> 04:01:19,740
This is...

5720
04:01:22,720 --> 04:01:23,800
Terrifying...

5721
04:01:26,510 --> 04:01:28,930
But there's nobody here...

5722
04:01:28,930 --> 04:01:29,550
Oh...

5723
04:01:31,510 --> 04:01:31,990
Bento...

5724
04:01:31,990 --> 04:01:33,410
I need to translate that...

5725
04:01:33,410 --> 04:01:34,450
It means that they are...

5726
04:01:34,450 --> 04:01:35,130
They are open...

5727
04:01:35,450 --> 04:01:35,930
For business...

5728
04:01:41,010 --> 04:01:41,490
See...

5729
04:01:41,490 --> 04:01:42,630
Guys, I sometimes...

5730
04:01:42,630 --> 04:01:42,970
Know Nihongo...

5731
04:01:48,280 --> 04:01:49,180
What is her...

5732
04:01:49,180 --> 04:01:49,780
Honey...

5733
04:01:49,780 --> 04:01:50,880
Is your name Yumi?

5734
04:01:51,500 --> 04:01:52,220
Absolutely not...

5735
04:01:52,220 --> 04:01:52,760
Who's asking?

5736
04:01:52,940 --> 04:01:53,600
It might be...

5737
04:01:53,600 --> 04:01:54,380
Are you going to order...

5738
04:01:54,380 --> 04:01:55,360
What's your agenda here, stranger?

5739
04:01:55,820 --> 04:01:57,160
I'm Nancy Drew...

5740
04:01:57,160 --> 04:01:57,700
Oh...

5741
04:01:57,700 --> 04:01:57,720
Nope.

5742
04:01:57,900 --> 04:01:58,540
Never heard of you...

5743
04:01:58,540 --> 04:02:00,600
But thank you for saying your name out loud...

5744
04:02:00,600 --> 04:02:01,240
Oh wait...

5745
04:02:01,240 --> 04:02:01,880
Nancy Drew?

5746
04:02:02,140 --> 04:02:03,580
As in friends with Bess and George...

5747
04:02:03,580 --> 04:02:04,840
And staying at the Ryok and Nancy Drew?

5748
04:02:05,000 --> 04:02:06,000
Or are there two of you?

5749
04:02:06,140 --> 04:02:06,820
Which one is it?

5750
04:02:06,980 --> 04:02:07,620
What is that?

5751
04:02:07,700 --> 04:02:07,800
That's me!

5752
04:02:08,300 --> 04:02:08,660
The...

5753
04:02:08,660 --> 04:02:10,520
Friends with Bess and George...

5754
04:02:10,520 --> 04:02:10,980
Excellent.

5755
04:02:11,320 --> 04:02:12,200
Yes, perfect.

5756
04:02:12,420 --> 04:02:13,160
Get over here.

5757
04:02:13,360 --> 04:02:13,660
Come on.

5758
04:02:13,900 --> 04:02:15,440
You're learning to make bento the Yumi way.

5759
04:02:15,560 --> 04:02:15,800
Wait, what?

5760
04:02:15,900 --> 04:02:17,200
Come on, trust me, it's a life skill.

5761
04:02:17,380 --> 04:02:21,240
Once you know how to make a good bento box, you pretty much got the whole world all figured out.

5762
04:02:21,800 --> 04:02:25,620
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sh-sh-sure.

5763
04:02:25,780 --> 04:02:27,060
Sure, sounds good.

5764
04:02:27,580 --> 04:02:27,980
Fantastic.

5765
04:02:28,280 --> 04:02:29,240
Here are the ingredients.

5766
04:02:29,740 --> 04:02:33,840
You may notice that they run the gamut from pretty cute to insanely adorable.

5767
04:02:34,460 --> 04:02:35,720
This is not an accident.

5768
04:02:35,720 --> 04:02:37,080
Okay, very easy.

5769
04:02:37,320 --> 04:02:40,900
The customers will give you a list of what they want and how they want it organized.

5770
04:02:41,140 --> 04:02:42,080
And you pack it together.

5771
04:02:42,360 --> 04:02:43,800
You won't believe how easy it is.

5772
04:02:43,920 --> 04:02:44,040
Oh, I see it.

5773
04:02:44,100 --> 04:02:44,680
Like sandwich.

5774
04:02:45,040 --> 04:02:45,260
Okay, I gotta go.

5775
04:02:45,460 --> 04:02:45,940
Going?

5776
04:02:46,080 --> 04:02:47,180
Where are you going?

5777
04:02:47,480 --> 04:02:48,080
The store.

5778
04:02:48,560 --> 04:02:49,200
Good luck.

5779
04:02:49,880 --> 04:02:50,940
You'll do fine.

5780
04:02:51,180 --> 04:02:51,520
What?

5781
04:02:51,980 --> 04:02:53,340
I'll be back soon.

5782
04:02:54,860 --> 04:02:55,340
Wait.

5783
04:02:55,920 --> 04:02:58,240
I guess I'd better get to work.

5784
04:03:00,220 --> 04:03:01,460
Are you kidding me?

5785
04:03:04,560 --> 04:03:06,480
Rabbit sandwich?

5786
04:03:08,320 --> 04:03:09,280
Um...

5787
04:03:09,280 --> 04:03:10,100
Bear...

5788
04:03:10,100 --> 04:03:10,660
Egg?

5789
04:03:11,660 --> 04:03:13,060
Bear sandwich?

5790
04:03:15,120 --> 04:03:15,600
Bear...

5791
04:03:16,080 --> 04:03:16,700
Rabbit.

5792
04:03:18,580 --> 04:03:19,420
Dun-dun.

5793
04:03:20,240 --> 04:03:20,820
Ding-ding-ding.

5794
04:03:22,760 --> 04:03:23,720
Wait, what's...

5795
04:03:23,720 --> 04:03:24,560
I don't understand.

5796
04:03:24,960 --> 04:03:26,080
What is...

5797
04:03:30,660 --> 04:03:32,040
Oh, my God.

5798
04:03:32,440 --> 04:03:33,200
Mucho texto.

5799
04:03:35,200 --> 04:03:35,840
What?!

5800
04:03:35,840 --> 04:03:38,520
Only three animal types are used per order.

5801
04:03:40,120 --> 04:03:41,540
What is this?

5802
04:03:44,500 --> 04:03:48,380
Wait, with this request you know the rice bear must be in the center.

5803
04:03:49,980 --> 04:03:53,080
This request is also three squares wide.

5804
04:03:53,340 --> 04:03:56,640
Compare its right column with the first request's right column.

5805
04:03:56,960 --> 04:04:02,980
Which has a bear... Is this like... Is this... Oh my gosh, it's...

5806
04:04:02,980 --> 04:04:05,080
It's Sudoku.

5807
04:04:06,860 --> 04:04:07,840
What?

5808
04:04:08,320 --> 04:04:08,540
Okay.

5809
04:04:09,820 --> 04:04:11,640
Uh... Okay.

5810
04:04:12,060 --> 04:04:13,140
So piggy here.

5811
04:04:14,380 --> 04:04:15,340
Right?

5812
04:04:15,880 --> 04:04:20,640
And then... What?

5813
04:04:24,720 --> 04:04:27,300
Wait, but rice rabbit is here.

5814
04:04:27,940 --> 04:04:29,000
Wait, what?

5815
04:04:29,300 --> 04:04:30,420
Am I doing this right?

5816
04:04:35,800 --> 04:04:36,780
Bentoku.

5817
04:04:37,600 --> 04:04:38,780
For real though.

5818
04:04:39,360 --> 04:04:42,240
I like how this is just a freaking egg.

5819
04:04:48,840 --> 04:04:50,500
This makes no sense to me.

5820
04:04:50,620 --> 04:04:51,720
I'm not gonna lie.

5821
04:04:58,600 --> 04:05:06,060
Maybe I... This request is also... Compare its right column with the first request's right column.

5822
04:05:06,260 --> 04:05:09,500
Which has a... Rabbit, bear, and blank.

5823
04:05:09,840 --> 04:05:12,040
With only one available spot for the pig.

5824
04:05:12,360 --> 04:05:14,180
This request must be the bottom row.

5825
04:05:15,300 --> 04:05:16,600
Combine the full request.

5826
04:05:16,760 --> 04:05:17,920
Rice, bear...

5827
04:05:18,720 --> 04:05:19,440
Pig.

5828
04:05:20,020 --> 04:05:20,220
Pig.

5829
04:05:24,470 --> 04:05:25,190
Pig.

5830
04:05:25,190 --> 04:05:25,190
Pig.

5831
04:05:25,190 --> 04:05:25,990
With the bottom row.

5832
04:05:26,710 --> 04:05:28,190
Pig sandwich blank.

5833
04:05:28,450 --> 04:05:30,750
To find that the bottom row contains a rice pig.

5834
04:05:31,510 --> 04:05:32,930
A sandwich bear.

5835
04:05:33,950 --> 04:05:36,270
Oh, I... Oh, okay.

5836
04:05:36,950 --> 04:05:37,750
Oh, I... Oh, okay.

5837
04:05:37,750 --> 04:05:39,470
Ah, I think I get... Okay, hold on.

5838
04:05:49,360 --> 04:05:53,180
This is so... Needlessly complicated.

5839
04:05:54,580 --> 04:05:57,080
Okay, so this must be the rice rabbit, no?

5840
04:05:57,620 --> 04:06:00,780
Because it's like rice... Rice...

5841
04:06:00,780 --> 04:06:02,580
And the rabbit.

5842
04:06:03,280 --> 04:06:03,840
And the rabbit.

5843
04:06:03,840 --> 04:06:04,220
Rice rabbit.

5844
04:06:07,580 --> 04:06:08,420
I...

5845
04:06:08,420 --> 04:06:08,800
I...

5846
04:06:09,920 --> 04:06:10,340
Think...

5847
04:06:10,760 --> 04:06:12,720
Wait, I'm so confused.

5848
04:06:15,560 --> 04:06:17,540
Rice rabbit, middle left.

5849
04:06:18,120 --> 04:06:19,200
Do these rotate?

5850
04:06:19,660 --> 04:06:20,040
Are...

5851
04:06:20,040 --> 04:06:21,700
Is it just in this corner?

5852
04:06:35,570 --> 04:06:37,130
They don't rotate.

5853
04:06:39,250 --> 04:06:40,730
So, bear egg.

5854
04:06:41,430 --> 04:06:42,190
Rice.

5855
04:06:44,450 --> 04:06:46,050
Maybe it's rice pig.

5856
04:06:49,150 --> 04:06:51,670
And rice rabbit, and then...

5857
04:06:51,670 --> 04:06:53,190
Pig.

5858
04:06:53,550 --> 04:06:54,350
Okay, okay.

5859
04:06:54,430 --> 04:06:55,490
I think I understand.

5860
04:06:55,870 --> 04:06:56,730
Okay, so...

5861
04:06:56,730 --> 04:06:57,530
Rice rabbit.

5862
04:06:57,930 --> 04:06:58,850
Pig something.

5863
04:06:59,790 --> 04:07:00,850
Rice pig.

5864
04:07:03,270 --> 04:07:04,910
Maybe it's sandwich pig.

5865
04:07:05,790 --> 04:07:07,270
And then bear rice.

5866
04:07:08,230 --> 04:07:09,350
Hey, I did it.

5867
04:07:09,690 --> 04:07:10,930
It was pretty cute.

5868
04:07:11,490 --> 04:07:12,710
Thanks for helping out, Fancy.

5869
04:07:13,410 --> 04:07:14,210
Rice that...

5870
04:07:14,830 --> 04:07:15,230
Oh.

5871
04:07:15,650 --> 04:07:16,050
Wow.

5872
04:07:16,450 --> 04:07:17,110
You bitch.

5873
04:07:20,710 --> 04:07:21,510
Okay, so...

5874
04:07:21,510 --> 04:07:22,950
Once I got it, it wasn't so bad.

5875
04:07:23,130 --> 04:07:24,550
But at first, I was like, What the hell?

5876
04:07:27,530 --> 04:07:28,830
I'm not into that sort of thing.

5877
04:07:29,070 --> 04:07:30,010
Couldn't you find a pamphlet?

5878
04:07:30,310 --> 04:07:31,870
I was hoping for an...

5879
04:07:32,310 --> 04:07:32,790
Insider's opinion.

5880
04:07:32,790 --> 04:07:33,630
She's such a weirdo!

5881
04:07:33,630 --> 04:07:34,530
Oh, I get it.

5882
04:07:34,530 --> 04:07:36,030
But you want the dirt on the situation, right?

5883
04:07:36,430 --> 04:07:37,730
Yes, exactly.

5884
04:07:38,410 --> 04:07:38,850
Interesting.

5885
04:07:39,570 --> 04:07:41,910
You're working some kind of anger here, aren't you?

5886
04:07:42,450 --> 04:07:43,150
Not that it matters.

5887
04:07:43,310 --> 04:07:44,330
Still, way too busy to talk.

5888
04:07:44,810 --> 04:07:46,710
I know you're busy, but...

5889
04:07:46,710 --> 04:07:47,970
I helped you out with bento.

5890
04:07:48,170 --> 04:07:48,270
So true.

5891
04:07:48,770 --> 04:07:48,950
So true.

5892
04:07:48,950 --> 04:07:50,370
All I want is a little information.

5893
04:07:51,010 --> 04:07:51,230
Okay.

5894
04:07:51,710 --> 04:07:52,210
For free.

5895
04:07:52,270 --> 04:07:54,430
Surrounded by breathtaking views, you'll not soon forget.

5896
04:07:54,730 --> 04:07:57,430
The Ryoka Hiei opens the door to a simpler time.

5897
04:07:58,090 --> 04:08:04,330
Perfect for the business traveler, hoping to experience traditional Japan, or the family in search of that perfect vacation.

5898
04:08:04,830 --> 04:08:07,390
Ryoka Hiei, discover Japan, discover you.

5899
04:08:07,830 --> 04:08:11,970
That's persuasive, but not exactly what I wanted to know.

5900
04:08:12,310 --> 04:08:12,770
Isn't it?

5901
04:08:13,150 --> 04:08:14,530
That's mine from years back.

5902
04:08:14,750 --> 04:08:17,850
I was thinking of going into advertising, but then I thought, nah.

5903
04:08:17,850 --> 04:08:22,050
I was hoping you could tell me a little about some of the strange things that have been happening.

5904
04:08:22,430 --> 04:08:22,830
Aha.

5905
04:08:24,010 --> 04:08:25,430
If you really want to know.

5906
04:08:25,690 --> 04:08:26,250
Oh no!

5907
04:08:26,570 --> 04:08:27,950
I'm running out of bento boxes.

5908
04:08:28,450 --> 04:08:30,610
Can you please go grab my backup stock from my apartment?

5909
04:08:31,210 --> 04:08:34,010
This is the sort of thing that can move us from buddies to straight up besties.

5910
04:08:36,530 --> 04:08:36,930
Um...

5911
04:08:36,930 --> 04:08:37,550
Sure.

5912
04:08:38,250 --> 04:08:38,650
Sure.

5913
04:08:39,050 --> 04:08:39,350
Great.

5914
04:08:39,610 --> 04:08:41,330
It's just over by the Kurume station.

5915
04:08:41,730 --> 04:08:43,790
I could tell right away that we were going to be friends.

5916
04:08:44,010 --> 04:08:44,670
Here's my key.

5917
04:08:44,770 --> 04:08:45,670
She gave me her key?

5918
04:08:46,670 --> 04:08:48,070
Oh, and P.S.

5919
04:08:48,190 --> 04:08:51,030
My number is 075-021-5855.

5920
04:08:51,350 --> 04:08:51,710
What?

5921
04:08:54,050 --> 04:08:54,690
Uh...

5922
04:08:54,690 --> 04:09:02,450
So I'm guessing Miwako wants to own the Ryokan to...

5923
04:09:03,350 --> 04:09:03,990
either...

5924
04:09:03,990 --> 04:09:05,050
to...

5925
04:09:05,050 --> 04:09:08,610
to either keep it the way it is or to sell it.

5926
04:09:08,990 --> 04:09:11,290
And then Yumi doesn't want it.

5927
04:09:11,790 --> 04:09:13,710
And Yumi is either going to...

5928
04:09:15,130 --> 04:09:22,910
sell it and Miwako wants to keep it the way that it is or Yumi is like just so nonchalant and...

5929
04:09:23,610 --> 04:09:24,010
and...

5930
04:09:24,710 --> 04:09:26,090
Miwako wants to sell it.

5931
04:09:26,170 --> 04:09:26,510
I don't know.

5932
04:09:27,390 --> 04:09:27,970
Oh, wait.

5933
04:09:28,070 --> 04:09:29,490
Maybe she'll translate the article.

5934
04:09:29,590 --> 04:09:31,250
Can you translate this article for me?

5935
04:09:31,510 --> 04:09:31,790
Okay.

5936
04:09:32,330 --> 04:09:33,290
Yeah, maybe she'll translate it.

5937
04:09:33,290 --> 04:09:34,110
How did you get this?

5938
04:09:34,670 --> 04:09:35,310
You know what?

5939
04:09:35,370 --> 04:09:36,370
I don't even want to know.

5940
04:09:36,610 --> 04:09:37,490
Just go put it back.

5941
04:09:38,350 --> 04:09:39,210
Oh, damn.

5942
04:09:39,630 --> 04:09:39,750
Okay.

5943
04:09:40,430 --> 04:09:41,850
Nancy, do you have my boxes?

5944
04:09:42,210 --> 04:09:42,950
Not yet.

5945
04:09:43,350 --> 04:09:43,850
Please hurry.

5946
04:09:44,090 --> 04:09:45,230
I need those boxes.

5947
04:09:45,650 --> 04:09:47,030
Oh, wait.

5948
04:09:47,090 --> 04:09:48,570
But the other questions...

5949
04:09:48,570 --> 04:09:49,890
Nancy, do you have my boxes?

5950
04:09:50,170 --> 04:09:50,990
Not yet.

5951
04:09:51,290 --> 04:09:51,930
Boxes, please.

5952
04:09:52,110 --> 04:09:52,890
This is an emergency.

5953
04:09:53,850 --> 04:09:55,510
I messed up.

5954
04:09:57,610 --> 04:09:58,210
Okay.

5955
04:09:58,630 --> 04:10:00,270
Where did she say her house was?

5956
04:10:03,750 --> 04:10:05,510
Just use Google Translate.

5957
04:10:05,630 --> 04:10:05,910
Right.

5958
04:10:07,750 --> 04:10:08,330
Um...

5959
04:10:08,330 --> 04:10:09,730
Oh, look at this.

5960
04:10:10,130 --> 04:10:10,630
Wow.

5961
04:10:10,870 --> 04:10:12,910
Oh, she probably needs the cat bentos, no?

5962
04:10:16,690 --> 04:10:17,270
Kuromi?

5963
04:10:21,890 --> 04:10:22,470
Transition.

5964
04:10:30,570 --> 04:10:32,110
Where did she say it was?

5965
04:10:35,570 --> 04:10:36,150
Kurume.

5966
04:10:36,370 --> 04:10:36,910
Kurume?

5967
04:10:37,610 --> 04:10:38,650
It's so far.

5968
04:10:39,470 --> 04:10:40,490
Oh, my gosh.

5969
04:10:44,370 --> 04:10:46,070
I guess we'll go back to...

5970
04:10:46,070 --> 04:10:46,370
Oh, hey?

5971
04:10:50,730 --> 04:10:51,250
Okay.

5972
04:10:51,490 --> 04:10:52,610
We'll go back to Fuji.

5973
04:10:53,530 --> 04:10:55,790
Actually, maybe we can go back home and...

5974
04:10:56,890 --> 04:10:57,210
Kurume.

5975
04:10:58,070 --> 04:11:00,050
Kurume, kurume, kurume, kurume.

5976
04:11:00,690 --> 04:11:02,010
From the red line.

5977
04:11:02,310 --> 04:11:02,590
Oh, wait.

5978
04:11:02,650 --> 04:11:03,470
No, we can go to Fuji.

5979
04:11:04,390 --> 04:11:04,870
Toyama?

5980
04:11:05,470 --> 04:11:05,950
No.

5981
04:11:07,350 --> 04:11:08,790
Because we need to go to the...

5982
04:11:10,610 --> 04:11:11,010
Uh...

5983
04:11:11,010 --> 04:11:11,490
Fuji?

5984
04:11:16,130 --> 04:11:16,530
Uh...

5985
04:11:18,830 --> 04:11:19,630
Fuji to...

5986
04:11:20,230 --> 04:11:21,950
How do we get to the...

5987
04:11:22,430 --> 04:11:23,470
Oh, to Seto.

5988
04:11:24,090 --> 04:11:24,210
Okay.

5989
04:11:24,570 --> 04:11:24,850
Fuji?

5990
04:11:25,170 --> 04:11:26,110
Okay, let's go back to Fuji.

5991
04:11:31,050 --> 04:11:35,890
Teda-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta...

5992
04:11:35,890 --> 04:11:36,330
Niigata.

5993
04:11:37,690 --> 04:11:38,490
Seto.

5994
04:11:41,410 --> 04:11:42,210
Toyama.

5995
04:11:44,750 --> 04:11:45,730
Wait, what?

5996
04:11:49,750 --> 04:11:52,450
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, we can go...

5997
04:11:52,450 --> 04:11:53,130
Kofu.

5998
04:11:56,410 --> 04:11:57,450
Straight to Saitama.

5999
04:11:57,630 --> 04:11:59,590
Wait, where do you see that, you guys?

6000
04:12:00,990 --> 04:12:01,510
Wait, wait.

6001
04:12:02,350 --> 04:12:06,030
Oh, no, Saitama, you can't, because...

6002
04:12:06,030 --> 04:12:06,510
Wait.

6003
04:12:07,330 --> 04:12:08,590
Saitama, you wouldn't be able to.

6004
04:12:08,710 --> 04:12:10,390
It doesn't have a pink around it.

6005
04:12:13,310 --> 04:12:15,210
It doesn't have a pink around it, you guys.

6006
04:12:17,770 --> 04:12:19,250
I wouldn't be able to transfer there.

6007
04:12:21,650 --> 04:12:22,710
Yes, you can.

6008
04:12:23,010 --> 04:12:23,270
Oh.

6009
04:12:39,630 --> 04:12:42,470
I want an apology from everyone who said Saitama.

6010
04:12:58,860 --> 04:12:59,420
What?

6011
04:12:59,760 --> 04:13:00,680
What is that?

6012
04:13:05,210 --> 04:13:06,870
Oh, her room is so cute!

6013
04:13:08,150 --> 04:13:08,950
I see.

6014
04:13:09,430 --> 04:13:10,350
Oh, I see.

6015
04:13:10,550 --> 04:13:11,510
Oh, wow.

6016
04:13:11,870 --> 04:13:14,190
Wait, did you see the eyes on this thing?

6017
04:13:15,350 --> 04:13:15,950
What's in here?

6018
04:13:16,010 --> 04:13:16,570
What are these?

6019
04:13:18,470 --> 04:13:19,450
What the hell is this?

6020
04:13:19,530 --> 04:13:21,430
I'm mega snooping, but you know what?

6021
04:13:21,510 --> 04:13:22,290
She deserves it.

6022
04:13:24,810 --> 04:13:25,530
Dear Marianne.

6023
04:13:26,550 --> 04:13:27,850
Oh, that was my phone!

6024
04:13:28,230 --> 04:13:28,770
Oh, thank you.

6025
04:13:29,570 --> 04:13:30,070
I'll check it.

6026
04:13:30,150 --> 04:13:30,390
Hold on.

6027
04:13:30,490 --> 04:13:31,150
I'll check it real quick.

6028
04:13:34,150 --> 04:13:34,510
Messages.

6029
04:13:37,950 --> 04:13:38,930
What the hell?

6030
04:13:38,930 --> 04:13:40,750
Who is that?

6031
04:13:42,190 --> 04:13:43,730
Who is this?

6032
04:13:48,540 --> 04:13:50,280
Who is this person?

6033
04:13:53,180 --> 04:13:54,380
Thank you, Yumi.

6034
04:13:57,300 --> 04:13:58,660
Dear Marianne.

6035
04:13:58,780 --> 04:14:00,880
As usual, these letters are piling up.

6036
04:14:00,880 --> 04:14:02,600
And I haven't made it to the post office.

6037
04:14:02,880 --> 04:14:04,480
It was great seeing you during your visit.

6038
04:14:04,840 --> 04:14:05,640
Hurry back soon!

6039
04:14:06,000 --> 04:14:08,660
I know I promised to make my way over to the States.

6040
04:14:08,880 --> 04:14:10,760
But life always has other plans.

6041
04:14:11,060 --> 04:14:12,540
The girls are keeping me busy.

6042
04:14:12,740 --> 04:14:14,700
And Ryokan is double booked as usual.

6043
04:14:15,180 --> 04:14:18,540
Yumi wanted me to tell you that she has a nice time.

6044
04:14:18,680 --> 04:14:20,360
Or she had a nice time during your visit.

6045
04:14:20,360 --> 04:14:27,640
Although, it would be hard to tell with her pouting for the cheap seats the whole time.

6046
04:14:27,840 --> 04:14:30,580
She and Miwako have been at each other's throats lately.

6047
04:14:30,780 --> 04:14:31,480
It's ugly.

6048
04:14:31,760 --> 04:14:35,240
I hope it's a phase, but I'm beginning to worry that it might not be.

6049
04:14:35,740 --> 04:14:37,320
Cassie and Ben are such good friends.

6050
04:14:37,420 --> 04:14:38,960
I wish I knew your secret.

6051
04:14:39,260 --> 04:14:40,380
They're so different.

6052
04:14:40,600 --> 04:14:43,580
You know, they remind me of you and me when we were kids.

6053
04:14:43,900 --> 04:14:47,420
You were always so serious, and I was always doing my best to get you in trouble.

6054
04:14:47,420 --> 04:14:50,260
I think that's what made us such good friends.

6055
04:14:50,480 --> 04:14:52,780
But for the two of them, it's always a battle.

6056
04:14:53,740 --> 04:14:54,440
Enough of that.

6057
04:14:54,700 --> 04:14:55,940
Send my love to the family.

6058
04:14:56,120 --> 04:14:57,160
I can't wait to see you again.

6059
04:14:57,760 --> 04:14:58,220
So-so.

6060
04:14:59,820 --> 04:15:00,720
So-so?

6061
04:15:02,180 --> 04:15:02,660
Kasume.

6062
04:15:02,980 --> 04:15:04,520
What the hell does that mean?

6063
04:15:07,500 --> 04:15:07,980
Oh!

6064
04:15:10,480 --> 04:15:11,160
Wait, what?

6065
04:15:11,380 --> 04:15:13,040
Choose shape, locate colors.

6066
04:15:15,920 --> 04:15:16,400
What?

6067
04:15:17,420 --> 04:15:18,280
What does this mean?

6068
04:15:21,280 --> 04:15:21,660
Huh?

6069
04:15:24,380 --> 04:15:25,840
What is this?

6070
04:15:29,020 --> 04:15:29,780
Oh!

6071
04:15:36,590 --> 04:15:37,350
What?

6072
04:15:42,520 --> 04:15:44,780
Make your own shadow puppets.

6073
04:15:46,020 --> 04:15:46,960
Oh-kay.

6074
04:15:48,900 --> 04:15:49,660
Okay.

6075
04:15:50,600 --> 04:15:50,660
Okay.

6076
04:15:51,780 --> 04:15:54,880
This is probably what they did with that lady, huh?

6077
04:15:54,880 --> 04:15:54,960
Huh?

6078
04:15:56,420 --> 04:15:57,080
Like that.

6079
04:15:58,960 --> 04:16:01,620
Attach the paper fasteners.

6080
04:16:02,500 --> 04:16:03,680
Look, she's got a Wii.

6081
04:16:06,820 --> 04:16:09,520
But seriously, what the hell is this?

6082
04:16:12,180 --> 04:16:14,340
Am I supposed to see a pattern?

6083
04:16:14,640 --> 04:16:17,600
I don't

6084
04:16:27,320 --> 04:16:28,140
have the info yet?

6085
04:16:28,340 --> 04:16:28,500
Okay.

6086
04:16:29,280 --> 04:16:31,080
I want to look at this poster.

6087
04:16:33,060 --> 04:16:34,180
Where's the boxes?

6088
04:16:40,490 --> 04:16:43,010
These must be what Yumi was talking about.

6089
04:16:43,250 --> 04:16:44,590
Yes, I got it.

6090
04:16:44,770 --> 04:16:44,910
Okay.

6091
04:16:45,730 --> 04:16:46,290
What else?

6092
04:16:46,410 --> 04:16:48,270
Look at how cute her apartment is.

6093
04:16:50,610 --> 04:16:51,890
So stinking cute.

6094
04:16:57,190 --> 04:16:58,190
Aw, Mia!

6095
04:16:58,670 --> 04:16:59,530
Thank you so much for the break.

6096
04:16:59,710 --> 04:17:00,170
Thank you!

6097
04:17:01,810 --> 04:17:03,350
God, I am snooping.

6098
04:17:03,470 --> 04:17:05,490
Good thing she doesn't have her undies out.

6099
04:17:07,090 --> 04:17:08,610
Nancy Drew sees all.

6100
04:17:09,510 --> 04:17:12,850
Nancy Drew didn't take off her shoes.

6101
04:17:15,450 --> 04:17:16,410
What's it?

6102
04:17:18,430 --> 04:17:19,890
Dashcon puppet.

6103
04:17:22,210 --> 04:17:23,030
Okay.

6104
04:17:30,090 --> 04:17:30,530
Nancy!

6105
04:17:31,070 --> 04:17:32,330
And you've got my boxes.

6106
04:17:32,590 --> 04:17:32,850
Neat!

6107
04:17:32,850 --> 04:17:34,490
Here, I've got a thing for you.

6108
04:17:34,610 --> 04:17:34,970
What's that?

6109
04:17:36,830 --> 04:17:37,790
It's a phone charm.

6110
04:17:38,090 --> 04:17:39,070
You can't not have one.

6111
04:17:39,950 --> 04:17:41,010
I already have one.

6112
04:17:41,230 --> 04:17:41,670
Thanks.

6113
04:17:42,170 --> 04:17:42,990
What's it do?

6114
04:17:43,350 --> 04:17:46,050
Come to think of it, it doesn't really do anything.

6115
04:17:46,510 --> 04:17:47,890
Get a job, phone charm.

6116
04:17:48,290 --> 04:17:49,290
It probably won't.

6117
04:17:49,490 --> 04:17:49,970
That's okay.

6118
04:17:50,170 --> 04:17:51,130
Just hang it on your phone.

6119
04:17:51,130 --> 04:17:52,210
I've got tons.

6120
04:17:52,490 --> 04:17:55,690
Help me with Bento, and I'll hook you up with some super cute ones.

6121
04:17:56,830 --> 04:17:57,270
Okay.

6122
04:18:00,190 --> 04:18:04,090
Get a job, phone charm.

6123
04:18:04,510 --> 04:18:05,710
That's the shocker of the decade.

6124
04:18:05,930 --> 04:18:07,390
She's hesitant to talk to herself.

6125
04:18:07,390 --> 04:18:09,090
The Minto plushies.

6126
04:18:10,830 --> 04:18:13,770
You can talk, you can say, Get a job, Minto!

6127
04:18:14,210 --> 04:18:14,730
Don't go!

6128
04:18:14,910 --> 04:18:16,110
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

6129
04:18:16,710 --> 04:18:18,030
What do you think of Rantaro?

6130
04:18:18,730 --> 04:18:22,310
Other than that he should get a job at the Nerd Statue Factory as their primary model?

6131
04:18:22,930 --> 04:18:23,810
He's a good time.

6132
04:18:24,350 --> 04:18:25,890
What do you think of Rantaro?

6133
04:18:26,910 --> 04:18:27,350
Rantaro.

6134
04:18:27,650 --> 04:18:29,790
There's something a little weird about him.

6135
04:18:30,190 --> 04:18:32,670
Yeah, that weird thing about him is his personality.

6136
04:18:33,490 --> 04:18:35,650
That kid is his own special kind of neurotic.

6137
04:18:35,950 --> 04:18:36,810
Huh, always has been.

6138
04:18:37,010 --> 04:18:39,170
But he's my fake little brother, so I'm used to it.

6139
04:18:39,510 --> 04:18:42,930
Until someone brings it up, I forget how he must seem when you first meet him.

6140
04:18:43,630 --> 04:18:45,810
What do you mean by fake little brother?

6141
04:18:46,330 --> 04:18:49,250
He first moved in next door when I was seven, and Miwako was five.

6142
04:18:49,730 --> 04:18:51,610
He followed us around day and night.

6143
04:18:51,930 --> 04:18:55,050
One day, when he was being a real pain to Miwako, A real real pain?

6144
04:18:55,210 --> 04:18:56,790
She just snapped and punched him.

6145
04:18:56,950 --> 04:18:57,230
Hard.

6146
04:18:57,450 --> 04:18:57,530
Damn!

6147
04:18:57,670 --> 04:18:58,350
It was bad news.

6148
04:18:58,350 --> 04:18:59,570
My mother saw.

6149
04:18:59,790 --> 04:19:01,970
After that, we had to be nice to him no matter what.

6150
04:19:02,110 --> 04:19:03,390
At least when she was in sight.

6151
04:19:04,310 --> 04:19:05,650
Eventually, he grew on us.

6152
04:19:06,310 --> 04:19:07,030
Especially Miwako.

6153
04:19:07,670 --> 04:19:08,930
Oh, yeah, childhood friend.

6154
04:19:09,770 --> 04:19:10,990
Get a job, Minto.

6155
04:19:11,170 --> 04:19:11,630
Not me!

6156
04:19:12,290 --> 04:19:14,190
You have to say to the plushie, Minto.

6157
04:19:14,450 --> 04:19:16,250
Why do you have a book on shadow puppets?

6158
04:19:16,610 --> 04:19:18,730
What does Takai think of you working here?

6159
04:19:19,110 --> 04:19:19,910
It's a phase.

6160
04:19:20,250 --> 04:19:21,130
Aro snap out of it.

6161
04:19:21,230 --> 04:19:25,450
Like I've been hypnotized, and one day someone says the right word and snaps their fingers, and Aro go.

6162
04:19:25,830 --> 04:19:27,070
Heyro, I am Yumi.

6163
04:19:27,070 --> 04:19:28,850
One job running Ryokan, please.

6164
04:19:29,730 --> 04:19:30,790
She's old school like that.

6165
04:19:31,190 --> 04:19:35,330
Thinks the fun parts of Raif are a phase, and the nasty parts are the bees and knees.

6166
04:19:35,590 --> 04:19:36,510
Bees and knees.

6167
04:19:42,220 --> 04:19:43,080
Bees and knees.

6168
04:19:44,320 --> 04:19:46,480
Hello, I am Yumi.

6169
04:19:49,320 --> 04:19:51,480
Childhood friend angle, my weakness.

6170
04:19:52,100 --> 04:20:06,720
What sucks about if you like childhood friend is, like that trope, is you can only, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't go back in time and make it possible.

6171
04:20:08,180 --> 04:20:08,860
You know?

6172
04:20:09,360 --> 04:20:12,400
Oh my gosh, I have a story though with one of my childhood friends.

6173
04:20:13,420 --> 04:20:24,960
I had moved, and I had my childhood friend come and stay with me for, I think it was like a week or something, when I was a kid.

6174
04:20:25,700 --> 04:20:26,160
And,

6175
04:20:30,440 --> 04:20:37,220
I was a bit of a tomboy, so I only had friends that were boys, but he came and stayed.

6176
04:20:37,640 --> 04:20:40,220
It was not long after, I don't know actually.

6177
04:20:40,480 --> 04:20:41,360
I don't know when it was.

6178
04:20:41,540 --> 04:20:43,580
But it was just for like, it was during summer vacation.

6179
04:20:44,100 --> 04:20:45,440
And so he came and stayed.

6180
04:20:46,300 --> 04:20:49,880
And it was.

6181
04:20:51,580 --> 04:20:54,760
It was the night before he left to go back home.

6182
04:20:56,120 --> 04:20:58,580
And we were just, we were just watching TV.

6183
04:20:58,920 --> 04:21:03,080
And then he gets something written on a paper, he like gets a piece of paper and is like writing on it.

6184
04:21:03,260 --> 04:21:05,320
And I was just like, what's, what's, what's he doing?

6185
04:21:05,620 --> 04:21:07,040
And I go to look at it.

6186
04:21:07,140 --> 04:21:09,260
And he like crumples it up and throws it away.

6187
04:21:09,360 --> 04:21:10,680
And he's just like, I'm gonna go to bed now.

6188
04:21:10,800 --> 04:21:11,140
Good night.

6189
04:21:11,280 --> 04:21:12,520
And I was like, okay, good night.

6190
04:21:13,820 --> 04:21:15,660
And maybe I shouldn't have looked at it.

6191
04:21:21,290 --> 04:21:26,650
because because it was a confession.

6192
04:21:31,340 --> 04:21:34,740
I never, I never told him that I saw it though.

6193
04:21:34,920 --> 04:21:37,960
I just, because I didn't, I didn't.

6194
04:21:42,380 --> 04:21:50,080
And I felt so bad because, because I was like, like, I didn't, I, you know, I was really young.

6195
04:21:50,700 --> 04:21:52,020
Neither of us could drive.

6196
04:21:53,020 --> 04:21:55,880
And, and my mom was really busy.

6197
04:21:56,440 --> 04:22:00,960
And so, she was just like, I can't, you're just gonna have to, like, hang out at the house.

6198
04:22:01,460 --> 04:22:04,800
And we, there was literally, like, nothing to do except watch TV.

6199
04:22:05,200 --> 04:22:06,360
Like, that's how it went.

6200
04:22:06,880 --> 04:22:22,250
And so, we were just like, we were, and, and, and, and, so, that, that was it.

6201
04:22:22,390 --> 04:22:27,330
That was the end of my, that, that was the, actually, after that, I never saw him again either.

6202
04:22:30,410 --> 04:22:33,910
After that, after that, he left and we never met again.

6203
04:22:36,590 --> 04:22:37,850
Are you two still friends?

6204
04:22:38,070 --> 04:22:38,230
No.

6205
04:22:40,710 --> 04:22:41,790
I, I don't know.

6206
04:22:41,950 --> 04:22:44,350
I don't know what that guy's up to anymore.

6207
04:22:44,890 --> 04:22:50,650
I don't, I've never, I haven't, I don't even, ah, yeah, I have no way to even find, talk to him, so,

6208
04:22:54,450 --> 04:22:55,590
I wonder why.

6209
04:22:55,890 --> 04:22:56,670
What do you mean?

6210
04:22:57,310 --> 04:22:58,650
It's not my fault.

6211
04:22:59,730 --> 04:23:01,590
What if I had never looked at the note?

6212
04:23:02,870 --> 04:23:04,190
I was being nosy.

6213
04:23:04,310 --> 04:23:05,310
I was being Nancy Drew.

6214
04:23:09,410 --> 04:23:11,570
I was like, oh, what if he drew, like, a picture?

6215
04:23:17,780 --> 04:23:19,960
That guy went on to write Kimi no shit.

6216
04:23:20,180 --> 04:23:24,540
At least you're saying accurate to the trope.

6217
04:23:24,940 --> 04:23:25,640
What trope?

6218
04:23:25,800 --> 04:23:27,300
Oh, like the childhood friends?

6219
04:23:30,860 --> 04:23:31,420
Yeah.

6220
04:23:32,440 --> 04:23:32,900
Maybe.

6221
04:23:33,340 --> 04:23:34,820
What, that they never get together?

6222
04:23:37,780 --> 04:23:39,380
Uh, so sad.

6223
04:23:40,040 --> 04:23:42,340
Maybe he went to jail or space or space jail.

6224
04:23:42,340 --> 04:23:43,960
Yeah, I should Google him.

6225
04:23:44,200 --> 04:23:45,180
Like, what are you up to?

6226
04:23:48,000 --> 04:23:52,180
My old crush is now my VTuber Oshi light novel anime adaptation.

6227
04:23:55,220 --> 04:23:56,240
That'd be crazy.

6228
04:24:00,840 --> 04:24:01,880
I don't know.

6229
04:24:02,000 --> 04:24:03,640
I don't know what that guy is up to anymore.

6230
04:24:04,440 --> 04:24:06,100
Never saw him again after that.

6231
04:24:06,420 --> 04:24:21,920
I don't think it was because, like, uh, because, you know, I just, I just moved really far away, so, uh, I think it was just a matter of we grew apart and I was, we couldn't meet up, so, you know.

6232
04:24:23,820 --> 04:24:25,460
She's your number one super chatter.

6233
04:24:26,500 --> 04:24:27,480
I hope not.

6234
04:24:30,260 --> 04:24:31,480
Uh, yeah.

6235
04:24:32,980 --> 04:24:35,060
I presume you would have turned him down anyway.

6236
04:24:35,740 --> 04:24:36,640
I don't know.

6237
04:24:37,140 --> 04:24:38,340
I think I was so, like,

6238
04:24:45,020 --> 04:24:47,740
I don't think I thought of him that way.

6239
04:24:47,840 --> 04:24:48,800
I mean, it was a long time ago.

6240
04:24:49,640 --> 04:24:50,040
Hmm.

6241
04:24:52,020 --> 04:24:52,420
Hmm.

6242
04:24:53,160 --> 04:24:58,360
Because it's just, like, you know, uh, all my guy friends, we were all just buddies, so.

6243
04:25:00,440 --> 04:25:01,840
In my, in my eyes.

6244
04:25:04,280 --> 04:25:04,980
But, yeah.

6245
04:25:06,020 --> 04:25:07,800
That's my childhood friend story.

6246
04:25:10,060 --> 04:25:20,440
If you, but yeah, if you like childhood friends, it's not like, uh, you know, like, if you don't keep in touch with your childhood friend, you can never have the trope happen.

6247
04:25:20,760 --> 04:25:21,580
So sad.

6248
04:25:22,340 --> 04:25:23,200
But he's home.

6249
04:25:26,200 --> 04:25:28,000
What do you mean I was a monster?

6250
04:25:28,380 --> 04:25:29,220
What did I do?

6251
04:25:30,160 --> 04:25:31,360
What did I do?

6252
04:25:32,180 --> 04:25:33,640
He dodged a bullet?

6253
04:25:33,820 --> 04:25:35,120
I agree, actually.

6254
04:25:36,080 --> 04:25:38,280
Your outfit is very interesting.

6255
04:25:39,100 --> 04:25:40,260
Where did you get it?

6256
04:25:40,760 --> 04:25:41,220
Get it?

6257
04:25:41,440 --> 04:25:43,760
Oh, you cannot get something this cool in a store.

6258
04:25:43,960 --> 04:25:44,680
I made it.

6259
04:25:45,100 --> 04:25:46,740
You make your own clothes?

6260
04:25:47,120 --> 04:25:47,420
Yeah.

6261
04:25:47,620 --> 04:25:49,660
I got sick of waiting for the boutiques to catch up to.

6262
04:25:50,200 --> 04:25:52,900
The places I go around here, fashion is the business.

6263
04:25:53,080 --> 04:25:54,120
You made us had to listen.

6264
04:25:55,580 --> 04:25:57,320
Oh, I've got the best thing.

6265
04:25:57,480 --> 04:25:58,220
You gotta have it.

6266
04:25:58,360 --> 04:26:00,420
I use it to come up with all of my new ideas.

6267
04:26:00,620 --> 04:26:01,040
What's that?

6268
04:26:01,320 --> 04:26:02,060
Oh, what's that?

6269
04:26:02,580 --> 04:26:03,940
It's a program for your phone.

6270
04:26:04,280 --> 04:26:06,900
You upload pictures to the computer and send them to your phone.

6271
04:26:07,120 --> 04:26:10,060
It lets you test out a new look on you or your friends.

6272
04:26:10,360 --> 04:26:11,720
It's back at my place on the computer.

6273
04:26:12,060 --> 04:26:12,820
Sounds great.

6274
04:26:13,200 --> 04:26:16,180
I don't usually have time to keep up with the latest fashion trends.

6275
04:26:16,900 --> 04:26:21,000
I could sort of tell, but I wasn't sure if you were going for an irony thing with your outfit.

6276
04:26:21,160 --> 04:26:21,280
What?

6277
04:26:21,880 --> 04:26:22,460
So rude!

6278
04:26:22,760 --> 04:26:23,100
Just teasing.

6279
04:26:23,440 --> 04:26:25,560
You pull off the old school thing, Nancy Drew.

6280
04:26:25,920 --> 04:26:27,400
Some things don't go out of style.

6281
04:26:27,640 --> 04:26:31,260
If you help me out with a little more bento right now, I'll hook you up with the program.

6282
04:26:31,680 --> 04:26:31,980
Come on.

6283
04:26:32,160 --> 04:26:32,700
Oh, okay.

6284
04:26:32,880 --> 04:26:35,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

6285
04:26:35,280 --> 04:26:36,100
Oh, okay.

6286
04:26:36,260 --> 04:26:36,760
Bear sandwich.

6287
04:26:38,520 --> 04:26:39,280
Bear rice.

6288
04:26:40,220 --> 04:26:40,360
Uh,

6289
04:26:47,680 --> 04:26:48,800
maybe piggy rice?

6290
04:26:50,120 --> 04:26:54,440
This, like, this is, because this, yeah, this would be a piggy rice.

6291
04:26:56,040 --> 04:26:58,100
Because, well, it doesn't have to be.

6292
04:26:59,180 --> 04:27:00,680
No, I mean piggy egg, sorry.

6293
04:27:01,040 --> 04:27:01,520
Piggy egg.

6294
04:27:03,260 --> 04:27:03,620
Maybe.

6295
04:27:04,540 --> 04:27:05,860
If I'm assuming this.

6296
04:27:08,900 --> 04:27:10,420
And then the bear and the pig.

6297
04:27:10,620 --> 04:27:13,360
It could be a, uh, wait, oh, wait, let's do this one.

6298
04:27:13,360 --> 04:27:15,380
I didn't, uh, piggy rice?

6299
04:27:18,460 --> 04:27:19,580
Or it could be middle.

6300
04:27:20,720 --> 04:27:20,860
Eh,

6301
04:27:26,670 --> 04:27:28,210
sandwiches are in the middle row.

6302
04:27:30,670 --> 04:27:31,610
How do you know?

6303
04:27:37,000 --> 04:27:38,900
Oh, I see.

6304
04:27:39,200 --> 04:27:40,840
Oh, wait, this has to be the, yeah.

6305
04:27:41,700 --> 04:27:43,920
Wait, I just remember.

6306
04:27:43,920 --> 04:27:44,780
Oh, realize.

6307
04:27:46,680 --> 04:27:49,200
Because, if I do this, then we can't do this.

6308
04:27:49,860 --> 04:27:52,940
So, this is this, and then this is, wait, huh?

6309
04:27:54,220 --> 04:27:54,600
Wait.

6310
04:28:02,340 --> 04:28:10,160
See, so if I do this, with sandwich, it wouldn't make sense for this square.

6311
04:28:11,140 --> 04:28:14,300
Um, yeah, we wouldn't be able to do this square.

6312
04:28:15,020 --> 04:28:16,660
So, it has to be down here.

6313
04:28:18,200 --> 04:28:19,780
And then the sandwich here.

6314
04:28:21,180 --> 04:28:21,620
Right?

6315
04:28:26,460 --> 04:28:28,880
And, eggy, eggy.

6316
04:28:30,040 --> 04:28:31,320
So, this is a sandwich.

6317
04:28:35,030 --> 04:28:36,390
And then piggy rice.

6318
04:28:38,330 --> 04:28:39,450
Can be here or here.

6319
04:28:41,310 --> 04:28:42,630
And it could be cat, cat.

6320
04:28:42,810 --> 04:28:43,850
No, it can't be cat, cat.

6321
04:28:46,210 --> 04:28:46,650
Cat.

6322
04:28:47,010 --> 04:28:49,730
Wait, but that would make it, oh no, cat sandwich.

6323
04:28:53,750 --> 04:28:55,750
then maybe cat rice.

6324
04:28:58,530 --> 04:28:59,730
Piggy, egg.

6325
04:29:04,560 --> 04:29:06,180
Oh, wait, hold on.

6326
04:29:07,920 --> 04:29:08,060
Oh,

6327
04:29:16,760 --> 04:29:17,720
put double sandwich.

6328
04:29:19,260 --> 04:29:19,840
Yeah.

6329
04:29:22,100 --> 04:29:24,700
Oh, you're right.

6330
04:29:25,540 --> 04:29:30,360
Ah, ah, I like, I don't mind this one not as much.

6331
04:29:30,540 --> 04:29:32,160
It's a little more challenging, so it's fun.

6332
04:29:36,530 --> 04:29:39,870
So, this would have to be, but it can't be the middle either.

6333
04:29:41,970 --> 04:29:44,110
Because it wouldn't be able to be two cats.

6334
04:29:47,190 --> 04:29:48,430
Unless it's like this.

6335
04:29:50,310 --> 04:29:51,510
wait a second, wait.

6336
04:29:52,010 --> 04:29:53,170
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6337
04:29:53,550 --> 04:29:54,030
Okay, hold on.

6338
04:29:54,530 --> 04:29:57,630
So, if this is sandwich, no.

6339
04:30:00,940 --> 04:30:06,260
Then, like this, could be the sandwich, sandwich.

6340
04:30:12,340 --> 04:30:15,940
So, sandwich, and then the sandwich.

6341
04:30:17,300 --> 04:30:18,940
This is another sandwich.

6342
04:30:33,980 --> 04:30:35,560
I'm just going to put a piggy sandwich.

6343
04:30:36,540 --> 04:30:37,440
So that we know.

6344
04:30:57,050 --> 04:30:57,850
Piggy rise.

6345
04:31:12,040 --> 04:31:15,600
But then, piggy egg, could go down here.

6346
04:31:16,840 --> 04:31:17,460
Wait, no.

6347
04:31:17,780 --> 04:31:18,220
Because, wait.

6348
04:31:18,560 --> 04:31:19,620
Oh, it's the cat cat.

6349
04:31:19,880 --> 04:31:21,120
Yeah, wait, this works, this works.

6350
04:31:21,120 --> 04:31:23,940
So let's say, let's just cat, cat.

6351
04:31:24,600 --> 04:31:26,020
And then this is two eggs.

6352
04:31:26,340 --> 04:31:26,460
Oh!

6353
04:31:30,790 --> 04:31:31,610
Does it work?

6354
04:31:32,710 --> 04:31:34,490
Wait, what's, what's wrong?

6355
04:31:36,090 --> 04:31:36,630
Oh, wait.

6356
04:31:37,270 --> 04:31:37,610
All right.

6357
04:31:37,730 --> 04:31:37,950
Yeah!

6358
04:31:37,950 --> 04:31:38,410
Who's next?

6359
04:31:38,810 --> 04:31:39,590
Step right up.

6360
04:31:39,950 --> 04:31:40,570
Great job.

6361
04:31:40,710 --> 04:31:40,950
Yeah!

6362
04:31:41,090 --> 04:31:41,750
There you go, Nancy.

6363
04:31:42,990 --> 04:31:43,450
See?

6364
04:31:45,050 --> 04:31:45,870
thank you.

6365
04:31:47,750 --> 04:31:49,570
Love that last picture you sent.

6366
04:31:49,910 --> 04:31:51,270
I know, isn't that one great?

6367
04:31:52,170 --> 04:31:53,210
Okay, why do you have a book?

6368
04:31:53,350 --> 04:31:55,390
Why do you have a book on shadow puppets?

6369
04:31:55,910 --> 04:31:57,650
Oh, that's Miwaku.

6370
04:31:57,910 --> 04:31:58,290
See?

6371
04:31:58,950 --> 04:31:59,870
It shouldn't be in my apartment.

6372
04:32:00,190 --> 04:32:01,990
It's just a stupid book about puppets.

6373
04:32:02,210 --> 04:32:06,330
It's just another one of the things that my grandmother is trying to auto-waste push on us.

6374
04:32:06,330 --> 04:32:10,750
Could you use something like this to make spooky shadows from far away?

6375
04:32:11,010 --> 04:32:12,290
It's totally Miwaku.

6376
04:32:12,870 --> 04:32:13,730
Yeah, I guess.

6377
04:32:13,930 --> 04:32:15,250
It's totally Miwaku!

6378
04:32:16,550 --> 04:32:18,410
I met your sister Miwaku.

6379
04:32:18,750 --> 04:32:20,210
You two seem pretty close.

6380
04:32:20,750 --> 04:32:23,890
That doesn't sound like the impression you'd get by having a chat with Miwaku.

6381
04:32:24,650 --> 04:32:26,050
What are you trying to ask?

6382
04:32:26,350 --> 04:32:28,870
Miwaku seemed a little upset about the Ryokan.

6383
04:32:29,130 --> 04:32:30,890
Do you know anything about that?

6384
04:32:31,250 --> 04:32:33,030
That's more her area of expertise.

6385
04:32:33,470 --> 04:32:35,510
I've never been the go-to guru for the Ryoka.

6386
04:32:35,510 --> 04:32:36,010
Guru.

6387
04:32:36,330 --> 04:32:38,010
That place is the definition of repetitive.

6388
04:32:38,330 --> 04:32:39,830
Guests come in, guests come out.

6389
04:32:40,030 --> 04:32:41,450
It's brain-breakingly tedious.

6390
04:32:41,870 --> 04:32:43,670
I don't know how Miwaku puts up with it.

6391
04:32:44,010 --> 04:32:44,350
Okay.

6392
04:32:45,430 --> 04:32:47,710
Does Miwaku like working at the Ryokan?

6393
04:32:47,830 --> 04:32:48,510
Well, yeah.

6394
04:32:48,750 --> 04:32:49,190
I'm gonna give her the other one.

6395
04:32:49,190 --> 04:32:51,250
Why Alice would she be there day in and day out?

6396
04:32:51,350 --> 04:32:51,990
I don't wanna give her my way.

6397
04:32:51,990 --> 04:32:54,150
What that girl needs is to spend some time out here.

6398
04:32:54,390 --> 04:32:58,210
A few weeks with me and my friends would be enough to shake her up and get her to have some fun for once.

6399
04:32:58,330 --> 04:32:58,650
Hmm.

6400
04:33:00,390 --> 04:33:01,790
Would you like a phone charm?

6401
04:33:03,330 --> 04:33:03,730
Oh!

6402
04:33:03,930 --> 04:33:05,430
I could give her back to Oniki.

6403
04:33:07,090 --> 04:33:07,810
Cute, thanks.

6404
04:33:10,270 --> 04:33:12,670
So, you don't wanna take over the Ryokan?

6405
04:33:12,910 --> 04:33:13,030
Oops.

6406
04:33:13,330 --> 04:33:14,130
Not even for a second.

6407
04:33:14,330 --> 04:33:16,310
I mean, I don't even get the whole tradition thing.

6408
04:33:16,550 --> 04:33:17,510
You wanna go to the past?

6409
04:33:17,630 --> 04:33:18,410
Get a time machine.

6410
04:33:18,650 --> 04:33:19,930
I'm not one for living in the past.

6411
04:33:20,030 --> 04:33:20,050
You're wacko.

6412
04:33:20,210 --> 04:33:21,230
Have you ever read a history book?

6413
04:33:21,350 --> 04:33:23,790
The past is where we keep all of the terrible things that have happened.

6414
04:33:25,210 --> 04:33:27,050
Another pronunciation of Ryokan.

6415
04:33:27,190 --> 04:33:27,510
I know.

6416
04:33:28,470 --> 04:33:29,950
Mr. Smovington, welcome to membership.

6417
04:33:30,150 --> 04:33:30,670
Thank you.

6418
04:33:32,030 --> 04:33:33,270
I don't understand.

6419
04:33:33,690 --> 04:33:38,970
If you're the one who's supposed to take over the Ria Khan, why is Miwako the one working there?

6420
04:33:39,470 --> 04:33:40,950
Ugh, Nancy-chan.

6421
04:33:41,130 --> 04:33:43,150
Don't get everyone else on me here.

6422
04:33:43,390 --> 04:33:48,550
If I had known I was supposed to run that place when I grew up, I would have taken a pass on the whole Firstborn thing.

6423
04:33:48,750 --> 04:33:52,130
If Miwako left the Ria Khan, who would run it?

6424
04:33:52,370 --> 04:33:53,050
I don't know.

6425
04:33:53,210 --> 04:33:53,890
It doesn't matter.

6426
04:33:54,150 --> 04:33:55,610
Why do you care so much about it anyway?

6427
04:33:55,870 --> 04:33:58,070
I'm just sort of naturally curious.

6428
04:33:58,070 --> 04:34:02,090
I'd back burner that curiosity as long as you're staying at the Ria Khan if I were you.

6429
04:34:02,290 --> 04:34:03,170
What do you mean?

6430
04:34:03,690 --> 04:34:04,670
Try not to find out.

6431
04:34:04,810 --> 04:34:05,250
Okay, Nancy?

6432
04:34:05,470 --> 04:34:06,210
You seem nice.

6433
04:34:06,910 --> 04:34:08,330
Oh, that's kind of...

6434
04:34:08,330 --> 04:34:08,570
Hello.

6435
04:34:09,190 --> 04:34:09,390
Hello.

6436
04:34:10,270 --> 04:34:13,010
Can you tell me a little bit about what happened with your mother?

6437
04:34:13,690 --> 04:34:15,510
This is not the time or the place.

6438
04:34:15,830 --> 04:34:17,230
Is there a better time?

6439
04:34:17,510 --> 04:34:18,970
Maybe when you're not at work?

6440
04:34:20,430 --> 04:34:22,910
There is never going to be a time or place.

6441
04:34:23,450 --> 04:34:24,150
Just drop it.

6442
04:34:24,290 --> 04:34:24,650
Place.

6443
04:34:27,070 --> 04:34:27,710
Nancy-chan.

6444
04:34:28,650 --> 04:34:29,710
Can you come back in a bit?

6445
04:34:29,850 --> 04:34:30,110
Hold on.

6446
04:34:30,490 --> 04:34:31,550
Can you come back in a bit?

6447
04:34:31,690 --> 04:34:32,170
Oh, okay.

6448
04:34:32,610 --> 04:34:33,750
Let's go to her house then.

6449
04:34:33,830 --> 04:34:36,830
I was going to ask to do more bento so we can try and get another thing.

6450
04:34:38,010 --> 04:34:39,130
Wait, what does that say?

6451
04:34:42,610 --> 04:34:44,270
Oh, Chika Tetsuno Eki.

6452
04:34:46,070 --> 04:34:46,590
What?

6453
04:34:49,290 --> 04:34:50,830
Ah, she's in Kurume.

6454
04:34:53,310 --> 04:34:54,410
I made her mad.

6455
04:34:54,550 --> 04:34:55,170
I think I did.

6456
04:34:55,170 --> 04:34:56,190
It's okay.

6457
04:34:56,230 --> 04:34:56,970
She'll love me later.

6458
04:34:57,210 --> 04:34:59,170
And we'll get more things for the avatar.

6459
04:34:59,830 --> 04:35:00,330
Oh, whoops.

6460
04:35:00,530 --> 04:35:01,770
I just kept her keys?

6461
04:35:02,190 --> 04:35:02,630
Okay.

6462
04:35:03,990 --> 04:35:05,590
At least I remembered to lock up.

6463
04:35:07,070 --> 04:35:09,290
Okay, so we are trying to get...

6464
04:35:11,710 --> 04:35:12,910
This piece...

6465
04:35:12,910 --> 04:35:14,790
Down here with blue...

6466
04:35:14,790 --> 04:35:16,050
Two blues in the corner.

6467
04:35:17,650 --> 04:35:18,990
And a blue up top.

6468
04:35:19,650 --> 04:35:20,670
Like, blue up top.

6469
04:35:21,810 --> 04:35:22,850
Blue up top.

6470
04:35:23,030 --> 04:35:23,790
Blue in the corner.

6471
04:35:25,850 --> 04:35:26,450
Uh...

6472
04:35:26,450 --> 04:35:27,550
No, not that...

6473
04:35:27,810 --> 04:35:28,310
Corner.

6474
04:35:28,310 --> 04:35:28,430
Corner.

6475
04:35:30,010 --> 04:35:31,670
This hurts my eyes.

6476
04:35:31,810 --> 04:35:33,550
Oh, it's so...

6477
04:35:34,310 --> 04:35:35,230
Oh, this one?

6478
04:35:35,610 --> 04:35:36,210
Oh, no.

6479
04:35:39,300 --> 04:35:40,420
Oh, the wrong corner.

6480
04:35:40,680 --> 04:35:40,880
My bad.

6481
04:35:42,040 --> 04:35:44,040
What kind of game even is this?

6482
04:35:44,380 --> 04:35:45,640
It's so horrible.

6483
04:35:46,240 --> 04:35:47,640
Who designed this?

6484
04:35:56,200 --> 04:35:56,800
Yeah!

6485
04:35:57,440 --> 04:35:59,160
Enter phone number to send avatar.

6486
04:36:00,260 --> 04:36:01,260
Choose a model.

6487
04:36:01,400 --> 04:36:01,580
Start!

6488
04:36:02,180 --> 04:36:03,100
Oh my god!

6489
04:36:15,110 --> 04:36:16,830
Wait, I'm gonna make...

6490
04:36:21,500 --> 04:36:22,040
Wow!

6491
04:36:23,400 --> 04:36:23,840
Woo!

6492
04:36:24,820 --> 04:36:25,820
They're different colors.

6493
04:36:30,550 --> 04:36:31,090
Wait.

6494
04:36:31,850 --> 04:36:32,730
It was rainbow.

6495
04:36:32,830 --> 04:36:33,590
What happened to it?

6496
04:36:33,810 --> 04:36:35,030
Oh, it's rainbow on this one.

6497
04:36:36,750 --> 04:36:37,290
Oh!

6498
04:36:38,150 --> 04:36:38,690
Oh!

6499
04:36:40,190 --> 04:36:40,970
Holy...

6500
04:36:44,440 --> 04:36:46,200
Wait, can we do Seifuku?

6501
04:36:47,210 --> 04:36:48,140
Oh, come on.

6502
04:36:48,740 --> 04:36:51,080
Seifuku is like the standard outfit.

6503
04:36:51,660 --> 04:36:52,440
Please!

6504
04:36:54,420 --> 04:36:55,200
What?!

6505
04:36:55,200 --> 04:36:56,280
We have a child...

6506
04:36:56,280 --> 04:36:56,660
Oh no!

6507
04:36:57,600 --> 04:36:58,500
We can...

6508
04:37:00,190 --> 04:37:01,700
This is horrendous.

6509
04:37:02,200 --> 04:37:03,680
What the hell is that?

6510
04:37:08,050 --> 04:37:08,770
What?

6511
04:37:08,770 --> 04:37:09,030
Oh, head.

6512
04:37:10,950 --> 04:37:13,990
What do you think of my anime character desu?

6513
04:37:15,430 --> 04:37:16,770
You're so cute.

6514
04:37:20,990 --> 04:37:23,290
We have a snake on our arm.

6515
04:37:27,170 --> 04:37:29,130
Oh, this is actually pretty moe.

6516
04:37:30,690 --> 04:37:31,950
Let's change the hair.

6517
04:37:34,450 --> 04:37:35,050
Kawaii!

6518
04:37:36,190 --> 04:37:37,270
Nancy-chan!

6519
04:37:40,690 --> 04:37:42,410
Nancy-chan, kawaii!

6520
04:37:44,030 --> 04:37:44,630
Kawaii!

6521
04:37:46,190 --> 04:37:46,790
Kawaii!

6522
04:37:53,610 --> 04:37:54,550
There we go.

6523
04:37:54,730 --> 04:37:55,450
I think this is good.

6524
04:38:00,910 --> 04:38:03,730
I almost thought it said yabai for a glance.

6525
04:38:04,010 --> 04:38:05,410
I was about to be like, no way, yabai.

6526
04:38:07,330 --> 04:38:09,370
The ubu is strong with this one.

6527
04:38:12,490 --> 04:38:14,510
Cool math game splash core.

6528
04:38:15,930 --> 04:38:17,950
Wait, who can I...oh wait, I need a phone number.

6529
04:38:22,500 --> 04:38:27,080
5-2-3-5-5-5-8-7-3-3.

6530
04:38:27,160 --> 04:38:28,260
Can you guys remember that?

6531
04:38:28,600 --> 04:38:33,260
5-2-3-5-5-5-8-7-3-3.

6532
04:38:36,740 --> 04:38:38,120
5-2-3.

6533
04:38:43,150 --> 04:38:44,610
What was the last bit?

6534
04:38:51,820 --> 04:39:04,360
8-7-3-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-6-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-6-6-5-6-5-5-5-6-5-5-5?

6535
04:39:04,700 --> 04:39:04,700
Ding!

6536
04:39:06,440 --> 04:39:07,440
I wonder why.

6537
04:39:08,360 --> 04:39:10,080
We got her phone number, too.

6538
04:39:10,980 --> 04:39:11,220
We got her phone number, too.

6539
04:39:11,220 --> 04:39:11,220
Right?

6540
04:39:12,300 --> 04:39:12,660
Yumi.

6541
04:39:13,060 --> 04:39:14,320
Can't call until I'm finished.

6542
04:39:14,620 --> 04:39:15,920
I can make a call later.

6543
04:39:16,920 --> 04:39:19,260
Do they call her Nancy Drew because Nancy is an artist?

6544
04:39:20,060 --> 04:39:20,500
Clearly.

6545
04:39:26,320 --> 04:39:27,700
Oh, I sent it to Bess.

6546
04:39:28,640 --> 04:39:29,220
I did?

6547
04:39:30,700 --> 04:39:32,080
Yeah, I clicked Bess.

6548
04:39:32,780 --> 04:39:33,720
I clicked Bess.

6549
04:39:34,660 --> 04:39:35,760
Send it to yourself.

6550
04:39:36,080 --> 04:39:37,360
I don't know what my number is.

6551
04:39:39,420 --> 04:39:40,800
Don't you gotta send it to yourself?

6552
04:39:40,900 --> 04:39:41,520
What's my number?

6553
04:39:42,740 --> 04:39:45,100
That's standard in non-Nancy Japan, Minto-chan.

6554
04:39:45,100 --> 04:39:51,540
This is the Japan where Ryokan's, this is Japan where Ryokan's where you learn origami, true!

6555
04:39:52,640 --> 04:39:53,600
I'm a fool.

6556
04:39:54,020 --> 04:39:55,160
Wait, let's make another one.

6557
04:39:58,820 --> 04:40:00,540
What if I pick no body?

6558
04:40:02,700 --> 04:40:04,460
It's just a shadow person.

6559
04:40:06,540 --> 04:40:07,140
Kawaii.

6560
04:40:08,200 --> 04:40:10,260
These are so ugly.

6561
04:40:13,080 --> 04:40:15,020
Oh, Lolita Desu!

6562
04:40:15,020 --> 04:40:17,160
Oh, so...

6563
04:40:17,160 --> 04:40:18,240
So beautiful.

6564
04:40:20,120 --> 04:40:20,760
Lolita?

6565
04:40:22,980 --> 04:40:23,620
Oh...

6566
04:40:23,620 --> 04:40:25,360
Lolita Desu?

6567
04:40:29,840 --> 04:40:31,300
I'll go with this one instead.

6568
04:40:32,000 --> 04:40:32,240
Wait.

6569
04:40:32,980 --> 04:40:34,580
I guess she's just a shadow person.

6570
04:40:35,820 --> 04:40:36,420
Sugoi!

6571
04:40:36,640 --> 04:40:36,880
I did it!

6572
04:40:41,020 --> 04:40:42,960
Like your friend in the hotel room.

6573
04:40:43,480 --> 04:40:44,140
So true!

6574
04:40:44,740 --> 04:40:46,300
Oh, it does kind of look like Peach, huh?

6575
04:40:46,300 --> 04:40:46,360
What's wrong?

6576
04:40:49,080 --> 04:40:49,720
Oh.

6577
04:40:52,280 --> 04:40:54,120
Way to make a style in Avatar.

6578
04:40:54,500 --> 04:40:59,180
Phone fashion software is here to keep your whole contact list looking fashionably fly.

6579
04:41:01,700 --> 04:41:03,200
See you on the runway.

6580
04:41:03,580 --> 04:41:04,100
Oh, gosh.

6581
04:41:04,560 --> 04:41:05,260
Yumi jumpscare.

6582
04:41:12,840 --> 04:41:14,060
Fashionably fly.

6583
04:41:14,560 --> 04:41:14,700
Woo!

6584
04:41:15,440 --> 04:41:17,500
This game is kind of dating itself, huh?

6585
04:41:19,900 --> 04:41:21,200
What is this?

6586
04:41:21,920 --> 04:41:23,020
So that's one...

6587
04:41:23,020 --> 04:41:27,700
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

6588
04:41:28,800 --> 04:41:29,160
Okay.

6589
04:41:30,640 --> 04:41:31,960
Madam Butterfly.

6590
04:41:34,620 --> 04:41:35,280
Hmm.

6591
04:41:35,980 --> 04:41:37,600
I want to make this Avatar.

6592
04:41:39,120 --> 04:41:40,120
Okay, guys.

6593
04:41:40,920 --> 04:41:43,500
I think I'm gonna call it quits for here today.

6594
04:41:43,920 --> 04:41:44,820
This is good fun.

6595
04:41:46,640 --> 04:41:47,860
This is good fun.

6596
04:41:49,340 --> 04:41:51,380
This song is driving me insane, actually.

6597
04:42:00,240 --> 04:42:00,740
Okay.

6598
04:42:04,960 --> 04:42:06,660
I have a delivery for you.

6599
04:42:06,820 --> 04:42:07,040
Oh!

6600
04:42:07,700 --> 04:42:08,540
Oh, she's got it!

6601
04:42:08,820 --> 04:42:09,480
Nancy Drew.

6602
04:42:10,160 --> 04:42:10,560
Thanks.

6603
04:42:11,020 --> 04:42:11,420
Thanks.

6604
04:42:12,120 --> 04:42:12,960
Um, wait.

6605
04:42:14,160 --> 04:42:14,560
Uh.

6606
04:42:15,760 --> 04:42:16,160
Uh.

6607
04:42:16,580 --> 04:42:17,160
Oh, gosh.

6608
04:42:17,240 --> 04:42:17,700
There's so much.

6609
04:42:17,780 --> 04:42:18,320
There's so much here.

6610
04:42:18,420 --> 04:42:18,740
Okay, hold on.

6611
04:42:18,780 --> 04:42:19,960
I'll let you get back to work.

6612
04:42:20,240 --> 04:42:21,060
Okay, see ya.

6613
04:42:21,440 --> 04:42:23,040
Wait, this is, uh...

6614
04:42:23,040 --> 04:42:24,820
This is what we were waiting for.

6615
04:42:25,120 --> 04:42:26,000
Oh, that's not it.

6616
04:42:26,880 --> 04:42:27,740
The package.

6617
04:42:28,280 --> 04:42:29,220
Where is it?

6618
04:42:29,460 --> 04:42:29,880
This one?

6619
04:42:30,160 --> 04:42:30,440
Wow.

6620
04:42:30,980 --> 04:42:32,000
George wasn't kidding.

6621
04:42:32,320 --> 04:42:33,760
This does look hard.

6622
04:42:36,520 --> 04:42:37,120
Oh.

6623
04:42:48,280 --> 04:42:49,600
No, no way.

6624
04:42:54,690 --> 04:42:56,770
Why couldn't it be a doodle grab?

6625
04:42:58,910 --> 04:43:01,750
Oh, but you do it in sections.

6626
04:43:02,330 --> 04:43:02,910
No.

6627
04:43:03,310 --> 04:43:04,310
This is so messed.

6628
04:43:04,610 --> 04:43:05,050
Why?

6629
04:43:05,050 --> 04:43:07,510
But I love the nonogram muscles.

6630
04:43:13,960 --> 04:43:14,600
Okay.

6631
04:43:15,620 --> 04:43:16,080
Uh.

6632
04:43:16,780 --> 04:43:18,060
We will...

6633
04:43:19,020 --> 04:43:21,160
We will do this next time.

6634
04:43:23,540 --> 04:43:25,140
Not right now.

6635
04:43:25,320 --> 04:43:26,080
So I'm gonna save.

6636
04:43:26,900 --> 04:43:27,500
Me too.

6637
04:43:29,140 --> 04:43:30,380
Don't laugh.

6638
04:43:30,560 --> 04:43:31,520
Why are you laughing?

6639
04:43:32,220 --> 04:43:34,060
Actually, before we do...

6640
04:43:34,580 --> 04:43:36,060
One last nonogram.

6641
04:43:40,680 --> 04:43:42,320
Never mind.

6642
04:43:55,010 --> 04:43:58,290
I've never done a 20 by 20 nonogram before.

6643
04:44:00,230 --> 04:44:01,650
I've never done one.

6644
04:44:04,050 --> 04:44:05,390
We will do it next time.

6645
04:44:05,770 --> 04:44:07,770
Thank you guys for Nancy Drew.

6646
04:44:08,670 --> 04:44:09,670
With me.

6647
04:44:09,910 --> 04:44:10,550
With me.

6648
04:44:10,550 --> 04:44:11,490
This was a lot of fun.

6649
04:44:11,990 --> 04:44:12,230
Um.

6650
04:44:13,350 --> 04:44:13,750
And...

6651
04:44:13,750 --> 04:44:14,270
Yeah.

6652
04:44:14,790 --> 04:44:16,370
It's already been almost five hours.

6653
04:44:16,570 --> 04:44:16,870
So...

6654
04:44:16,870 --> 04:44:17,910
I'm getting sleepy.

6655
04:44:18,750 --> 04:44:19,610
I hope...

6656
04:44:19,610 --> 04:44:21,370
You haunt the person that made that...

6657
04:44:21,370 --> 04:44:22,970
That streamwire puzzle.

6658
04:44:23,250 --> 04:44:23,970
I will.

6659
04:44:24,350 --> 04:44:25,130
I will.

6660
04:44:26,970 --> 04:44:27,890
Thank you guys.

6661
04:44:28,230 --> 04:44:28,470
Oh wait.

6662
04:44:28,690 --> 04:44:30,730
Let me lick my ghostly part.

6663
04:44:30,990 --> 04:44:31,450
I'm in the...

6664
04:44:31,450 --> 04:44:32,850
I'm in the haunted...

6665
04:44:32,850 --> 04:44:32,930
My god.

6666
04:44:40,270 --> 04:44:41,610
I slept in the middle.

6667
04:44:41,790 --> 04:44:41,990
Good.

6668
04:44:42,210 --> 04:44:42,550
I'm glad.

6669
04:44:42,830 --> 04:44:42,870
Oh.

6670
04:44:43,050 --> 04:44:43,450
Hi dog.

6671
04:44:43,690 --> 04:44:44,390
Thanks, dry princess.

6672
04:44:45,750 --> 04:44:47,410
My throat's a little sore.

6673
04:44:48,030 --> 04:44:48,550
Today.

6674
04:44:49,670 --> 04:44:50,530
And I'm sleepy.

6675
04:44:50,970 --> 04:44:51,330
Yippee.

6676
04:44:52,690 --> 04:44:52,870
Ha.

6677
04:44:53,390 --> 04:44:53,630
Wait.

6678
04:44:53,810 --> 04:44:54,110
Do I...

6679
04:44:54,110 --> 04:44:54,990
Do I stream tomorrow?

6680
04:44:56,610 --> 04:44:58,450
I can't remember what days I took off.

6681
04:45:01,210 --> 04:45:01,730
Oh.

6682
04:45:01,870 --> 04:45:02,990
I have tomorrow off.

6683
04:45:03,790 --> 04:45:04,310
Yippee.

6684
04:45:05,390 --> 04:45:05,910
Rugamesh.

6685
04:45:05,990 --> 04:45:07,130
Sorry for crashing the line.

6686
04:45:07,350 --> 04:45:09,950
I tried to run from the mid-cafe to make it.

6687
04:45:09,950 --> 04:45:12,650
I'll be sure to be early next time.

6688
04:45:12,690 --> 04:45:12,930
No.

6689
04:45:13,310 --> 04:45:14,250
You're all good.

6690
04:45:16,370 --> 04:45:16,890
Rugamesh.

6691
04:45:16,990 --> 04:45:17,390
All good.

6692
04:45:17,550 --> 04:45:17,810
All good.

6693
04:45:17,930 --> 04:45:18,250
All good.

6694
04:45:18,450 --> 04:45:19,870
I have no stream tomorrow.

6695
04:45:23,090 --> 04:45:25,570
But I have other things to work on.

6696
04:45:25,830 --> 04:45:27,210
So I have...

6697
04:45:27,210 --> 04:45:28,330
I will be busy busy.

6698
04:45:29,210 --> 04:45:29,550
Anyway.

6699
04:45:30,470 --> 04:45:30,990
Yeah.

6700
04:45:31,650 --> 04:45:33,390
Actually, I have lots to do tomorrow.

6701
04:45:35,550 --> 04:45:36,070
Yeah.

6702
04:45:37,090 --> 04:45:37,610
Otsumito.

6703
04:45:37,850 --> 04:45:38,250
Otsumito.

6704
04:45:38,470 --> 04:45:39,250
And thank you guys.

6705
04:45:39,430 --> 04:45:39,630
Bye.

6706
04:45:40,290 --> 04:45:41,430
For Nancy Drew.

6707
04:45:41,830 --> 04:45:42,870
I guess we can...

6708
04:45:42,870 --> 04:45:44,090
Finish this.

6709
04:45:44,230 --> 04:45:44,370
Maybe.

6710
04:45:44,570 --> 04:45:44,850
Next week.

6711
04:45:45,010 --> 04:45:45,330
I don't...

6712
04:45:45,330 --> 04:45:45,650
Let's see.

6713
04:45:45,770 --> 04:45:48,390
How long to beat Nancy Drew?

6714
04:45:49,530 --> 04:45:49,950
Which...

6715
04:45:49,950 --> 04:45:50,910
Which is Shadow...

6716
04:45:52,390 --> 04:45:52,870
Something.

6717
04:45:53,050 --> 04:45:53,190
Something.

6718
04:45:54,190 --> 04:45:55,570
Shadow at the water's edge.

6719
04:45:56,870 --> 04:45:58,650
About eight and a half hours.

6720
04:46:00,650 --> 04:46:01,890
I think we got this.

6721
04:46:03,710 --> 04:46:04,850
I think we got this.

6722
04:46:05,190 --> 04:46:06,390
I'm a little slow though.

6723
04:46:06,510 --> 04:46:07,290
Because I...

6724
04:46:08,370 --> 04:46:09,750
Like to just chit-chat.

6725
04:46:09,950 --> 04:46:10,550
And stuff.

6726
04:46:11,570 --> 04:46:11,970
Okay.

6727
04:46:12,450 --> 04:46:12,810
Okay.

6728
04:46:13,070 --> 04:46:13,150
Okay.

6729
04:46:13,370 --> 04:46:13,450
Okay.

6730
04:46:13,810 --> 04:46:14,970
Thank you guys for watching.

6731
04:46:15,170 --> 04:46:16,090
And I hope you guys have a great day.

6732
04:46:16,210 --> 04:46:16,610
Have a great night.

6733
04:46:16,690 --> 04:46:17,990
And I'll see you next when I...

6734
04:46:17,990 --> 04:46:18,650
See you.

6735
04:46:19,550 --> 04:46:20,230
Bye-bye.

6736
04:46:20,390 --> 04:46:20,650
Bye-bye.

6737
04:46:21,330 --> 04:46:22,110
Bye-bye.

6738
04:46:22,430 --> 04:46:22,670
Bye-bye.

6739
04:46:22,670 --> 04:46:23,130
Thank you.

6740
04:46:23,890 --> 04:46:24,630
Bye-bye.

6741
04:46:24,630 --> 04:46:27,090
Bye-bye.

6742
04:46:27,090 --> 04:46:27,810
Bye-bye.

6743
04:47:13,410 --> 04:47:16,210
Bye-bye.

6744
04:47:23,240 --> 04:47:25,360
Ending screen birthday song.
