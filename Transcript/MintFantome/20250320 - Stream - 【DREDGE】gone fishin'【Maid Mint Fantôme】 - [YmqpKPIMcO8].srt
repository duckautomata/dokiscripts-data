1
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,140
Welcome back, Master!

2
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,460
Hello everybody!

3
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,140
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome!

4
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,920
Welcome in!

5
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,550
No!

6
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,190
Rice nut!

7
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,090
Stop!

8
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,990
Stop!

9
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,410
I think people think it's serious.

10
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,950
Stop!

11
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,090
Stop it, please!

12
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,710
Hello everybody.

13
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,630
Goat men-nasai.

14
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,710
Goat men.

15
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,970
Happy birthday!

16
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,390
So fast.

17
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,890
We'll do a quick birthday song before we continue.

18
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,290
Ooh, J-Rag, thank you so much for the birthday gift.

19
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,970
Thank you!

20
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,610
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

21
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,450
Happy birthday to you!

22
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,890
Happy birthday to you!

23
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,490
Happy birthday, goat men-nasai!

24
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,330
Happy birthday to you!

25
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,350
Happy birthday!

26
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,670
Welcome everybody to Dredge.

27
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,890
Dredge.

28
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,610
Dredge.

29
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,310
Dredge.

30
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,990
Dredge.

31
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,690
Dredge.

32
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,250
Dredge.

33
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,910
What does the hat say?

34
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,130
Should I make it bigger?

35
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,110
Women fear me, fish fear me, men turn their eyes away from me.

36
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,230
As I walk, no beast dare make a sound.

37
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,750
In my presence, I am alone on this barren earth.

38
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,440
Nice.

39
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,920
That's what my hat says.

40
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,280
Hopefully I'm not blocking.

41
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,840
I'll move around if I'm blocking anything, you know.

42
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,260
I heard you weren't graduating, Mint.

43
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,800
Yeah, you heard the real truth.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,860
Lots of people don't graduate.

45
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,700
It doesn't make you any less smart.

46
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,340
Wait!

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,760
Excuse me.

49
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,020
Am I a joke to you?

50
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,520
I graduated clown college.

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,040
Probably.

52
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,760
Thank you so much for the birthday gift, dude.

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,900
Thank you.

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,540
Killer whale.

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,660
Yeah, look at that.

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,020
Look at me with the little clown wig.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,680
It's not a wig.

58
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,100
It was a phase.

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
That's an actual self-portrait.

60
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,540
I went to one of those department stores and got a nice little picture of me.

61
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,760
To commemorate graduating clown college.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,220
It's like I can still hear her.

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,480
What was the clown name?

64
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,160
Lil' Minky.

65
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,440
Obviously.

66
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,740
Lil' Minky.

67
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,980
Yeah.

68
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,700
Lil' Minky.

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,540
Yeah, obviously.

70
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,460
And it's a very versatile name.

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,320
It can work as a lot of things.

72
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,340
Like people are saying it's a good rap name.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,820
Well, it was my rap name.

74
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,840
It's my government name.

75
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,700
It's my clown name.

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
It's... yeah.

77
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,400
It's a lot of things.

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,320
Yeah, my government name.

79
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,460
Lil' Minky.

80
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,560
Minky.

81
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,280
Yeah, first name Lil'.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,420
Last name Minky.

83
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,230
Yeah.

84
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,810
Middle name is...

85
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,550
Crazy.

86
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,510
Lil' Crazy Minky.

87
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,410
You know, I don't want to scare anybody off.

88
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,110
When they first meet me.

89
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,170
If I'm just like, hey, I'm Lil' Crazy Minky.

90
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,770
They'll be like, woah, woah, woah, buddy.

91
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,490
Woah, woah.

92
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,730
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

93
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,530
Your rap name is MCMF?

94
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,350
That sounds wrong.

95
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,510
Wait, I don't get it.

96
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,910
I don't get it.

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,180
Lil' C Minky.

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,960
MC...

99
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,120
MF?

100
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,740
Like I'm an MC?

101
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:12,860
MC?

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,320
Like I'm intro...

103
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,460
Introducing?

104
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,280
Introdu...

105
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,560
No, I almost said it again.

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,720
Introducing the show?

107
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,500
Like I'm talking at the show?

108
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,640
MC Minky.

109
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,180
Welcome to membership.

110
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,280
Thank you.

111
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,460
Guys, we're playing dredge today.

112
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,240
Um...

113
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
I have seen...

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,140
That other people have played this.

115
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,680
And I have thought, I want to play this too.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,420
Because it looks like...

117
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,620
Up my type...

118
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,480
Up my alley.

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
And I was like, oh, but I won't watch.

120
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,420
That's always such a frustrating thing, no?

121
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,240
When I see a game and I'm like, I wanna play this.

122
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,480
I...

123
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,480
I...

124
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,940
Won't watch it, but then I'm just like...

125
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,620
But I wanna watch Marushi's play game.

126
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,020
It's so good, isn't it?

127
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,980
Zero, thank you so much for the 5k.

128
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,040
Thank you.

129
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,960
Thank you, thank you.

130
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,140
Me with Outer Wilds.

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,620
Everybody says not to...

132
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,820
Watch Outer Wilds.

133
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,500
But to experience Outer Wilds.

134
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
But I still think you can watch it.

135
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,760
I don't know.

136
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,580
Can I get a feel better beam?

137
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,260
James!

138
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,560
Oh, my voice.

139
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,440
James!

140
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,540
Feel better...

141
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,060
Beam!

142
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,820
Feel better.

143
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,530
Outer Wilds is better to watch...

144
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,070
After you play.

145
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,110
I guess I get that.

146
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,830
But I was happy.

147
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,870
There were some people that were just like, oh...

148
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,090
You know...

149
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,110
Streamers playing Outer Wilds...

150
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,930
Like when they get to the end, it doesn't hit the same...

151
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,470
To the streamer.

152
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,330
But I still feel like it did.

153
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,450
I don't know, I guess it depends on the person.

154
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,710
Maybe it depends on the person.

155
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,970
I should say.

156
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,110
I just remembered.

157
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,030
Friday, I have to change the time of...

158
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,770
Devil May Cry.

159
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,810
It will probably be...

160
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,850
A few hours early.

161
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:29,930
Maybe.

162
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,410
So, I will...

163
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,370
I will post that later.

164
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

165
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,130
I will post that later, later, later.

166
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,950
I'm not rowdating.

167
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,510
No!

168
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,810
So, yeah.

169
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,950
I meant to say it the other day.

170
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,630
And I forgot.

171
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,450
But, yeah.

172
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,310
Yeah.

173
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,930
It will be like a midday stream for me.

174
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,550
So, sorry.

175
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,890
I'm so sorry.

176
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,670
Yeah.

177
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,250
I meant to say it.

178
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,490
Yeah, exactly.

179
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,530
Thank you for loving us, Minto.

180
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,710
You...

181
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,710
You saw nothing.

182
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,570
Hi Minto.

183
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,430
Hello Unreal Citizen.

184
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,470
Hello.

185
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,410
Too late!

186
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,330
Let's play the game.

187
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,770
Let's play some dredge.

188
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,410
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,870
Let's dredging the depths.

190
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,730
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho.

191
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,990
Job listing.

192
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,190
Angler wanted.

193
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,570
Was that me?

194
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,630
Oh sorry.

195
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,950
Yo-ho, yo-ho.

196
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,310
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho.

197
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,670
I hope that's not me!

198
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,290
That's my ship!

199
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,650
Oh no!

200
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,330
I look rough.

201
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,050
What kind of bait would you use to catch wisps?

202
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,150
A little bit of this.

203
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,750
A little bit of...

204
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,910
The morning light fills your eyes and you try to sit upright.

205
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,670
You're lying on the cold wet dock where you collapsed the night before.

206
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:18,930
Oh!

207
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,550
A short man is shouting orders at a handful of workers disembarking from a boat nearby.

208
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,090
The man notices you.

209
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,690
It worked!

210
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,570
I died.

211
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,950
Ah.

212
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,390
Ah, well, welcome to Greater Marrow.

213
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,570
I must say, quite the dramatic first impression.

214
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,950
I see you've already introduced yourself to the jagged rocks along the bay.

215
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,730
Did you not see the lighthouse that was shining bright at you?

216
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,210
Ah, well, I'm glad to see our new fisherman upright and breathing.

217
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:56,750
A birthday!

218
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:57,810
Wait, hold on.

219
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,170
This game is one of those, see, like, you can see my mouse.

220
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,430
I can't escape, so I can't scroll up.

221
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,290
Hold on.

222
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,150
What if I do this?

223
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,290
Ah, I'm free!

224
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,550
Thank you guys!

225
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,490
Ducky, thanks for the five gifts.

226
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

227
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,110
I missed my birthday song, Cash, and it was early in this month.

228
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,350
Oh!

229
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,890
I got you, Junto.

230
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,250
Happy birthday to you.

231
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,910
Happy birthday to you.

232
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,570
Happy birthday, dear Junto.

233
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,610
Happy birthday to you.

234
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,990
Happy birthday!

235
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,080
Can I get an amen?

236
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,900
Amen!

237
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,020
Alright.

238
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,820
Your boat was hopelessly damaged.

239
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,620
But I've had a few of the locals move your things to one of our old vessels.

240
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,260
We'll catch up later to discuss more details.

241
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,440
I'll let you get out there to catch some fish.

242
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,140
I think I need to see a doctor.

243
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,240
I think I need to catch some Zs.

244
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
I slept on the dock.

245
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,380
Mayor, please!

246
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,620
Give me at least one day to settle in, no?

247
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,380
Walk it off?

248
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,620
I'm so... I'm so... I'm so strong.

249
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,860
It's 6 AM!

250
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,220
See if you can fill your cargo while you get your bearings in the life.

251
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,880
Finally, I don't suppose I need to say this, but get back by sundown before the fog rolls in.

252
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,560
Keep a close eye on the time.

253
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,400
It can really creep up on you.

254
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,320
It's 6 AM.

255
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,220
What are these torturous working hours?

256
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,060
Working from 9 to 9.

257
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,640
Wish you the best in your future.

258
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,820
My future is here!

259
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,060
I'm not graduating!

260
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,560
I can't tell if you're joking or not anymore.

261
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,020
No!

262
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,490
Almost died from drowning, but you're still coming in, right?

263
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,810
Of course, boss.

264
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,590
Alright, let's see.

265
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,070
We're gonna... What's tab?

266
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,930
This is our...

267
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,030
Okay, hold on.

268
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,490
Let me figure out where I should hang out here.

269
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,270
Maybe I just shrink myself.

270
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,790
My hat is in the way.

271
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,170
If I'm like here, does this seem like a decent spot to be in?

272
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,270
Do you think I'll be blocking much?

273
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,850
It's like I'm swimming.

274
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,790
I'm the fishy.

275
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,110
Maybe.

276
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,130
We'll see.

277
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,370
We'll figure it out as the game goes on.

278
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,870
My cabin.

279
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,210
I have pursuits.

280
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,810
Catch fish for the day.

281
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:07,890
Met the mayor of Great Marrow who sent me out to catch some fish and find my bearings.

282
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,090
Seems nice enough.

283
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,950
Warned me to get back before nightfall though.

284
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,230
Said something about fog.

285
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,170
A bit dramatic.

286
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,070
Alright, alright, alright.

287
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,390
We have a map.

288
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,470
Devil's spine.

289
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,070
I'm going that way.

290
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,170
We got some messages.

291
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,070
Nobody loves us.

292
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,050
Okey-dokey.

293
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,110
Move forward with Waseda.

294
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,610
Music's a little loud.

295
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,250
Here we go!

296
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,150
So when I move, the time advances?

297
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,010
That's crazy.

298
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,030
Is this one piece?

299
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,670
Yo-ho.

300
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,030
Give it up for Luffy.

301
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,750
Yo-ho.

302
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,850
Rotate with this and just hide with...

303
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,080
Wait, I don't see the height changing.

304
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,940
Oh, I think just like going up and down.

305
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,300
Just kidding.

306
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,480
Okay, I think this is a fishing spot!

307
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,240
We're gonna start fishing!

308
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,380
I'm too good.

309
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,560
I got a blue mackerel.

310
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:29,800
Wow.

311
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,280
I kind of...

312
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,720
I think because of Keep Driving, if you haven't watched me play that game.

313
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,640
It's like... It's driving roguelike.

314
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,500
Like sort of RPG.

315
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,460
But because of that, I've been like, I kind of want to play like inventory management stuff all of a sudden, you know?

316
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,140
Well, what time is sundown?

317
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,100
I guess it tells us, huh?

318
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,460
Disturbed water.

319
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,820
Oh, I got a cod.

320
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,900
Been wanting to... Yeah.

321
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,080
We're gonna put him right there.

322
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,000
When the sun is down.

323
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,820
Makes sense to me.

324
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,060
Makes sense to me.

325
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,120
Anyways, guys, today is... Wednesday?

326
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,820
Is Wednesday, my dudes?

327
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,880
Is it?

328
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,100
Maybe not for... Oh.

329
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,220
Shallow.

330
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,360
You don't have the right equipment.

331
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,360
Oh, man.

332
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,860
Happy midweek, everybody.

333
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:46,940
Everybody?

334
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,500
This is so calm.

335
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,320
This is so chill.

336
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,560
Oh, we got another blue mackerel.

337
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,280
Hump day!

338
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,340
That's what my dog used to do.

339
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,900
Wait, is this another town?

340
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,700
Ahoy, neighbors!

341
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,720
Wait.

342
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,920
What's that over there?

343
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,860
You guys see that shiny?

344
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm going beyond.

345
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,660
Time only advances when you're moving, fishing, or taking other specific actions.

346
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh, wait.

347
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,520
What's this?

348
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,440
Shipwreck?

349
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm dredging.

350
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,840
I'm dredging.

351
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,040
Oh.

352
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,780
I can't dredge.

353
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,380
What does dredge mean?

354
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,720
I thought it was like a play on dread.

355
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,060
Oops.

356
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,400
It's a message!

357
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,240
It's a message in a bottle.

358
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,420
Collect.

359
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,520
Oh, there's more over there.

360
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,660
Yo-ho.

361
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,360
Wait, this looks like a damaged ship.

362
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,020
It's not my ship, right?

363
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,380
That would be pretty unfortunate.

364
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,820
Lure bottles.

365
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,940
Removing stuff off the sea floor.

366
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,440
I see.

367
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,080
Oh, I can't dredge.

368
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,520
No.

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,420
But this sunken ship is so mysterious.

370
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,240
Let's see.

371
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,960
What do we got here?

372
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,160
It's also a cooking term for covering in batter.

373
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,260
Yummy.

374
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I can't dredge here either.

375
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,280
Give me some fish.

376
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,520
Give me some fish.

377
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,440
Over there.

378
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,000
I see some.

379
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,100
Oh, right here.

380
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,440
Right here.

381
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,880
I'm fishing.

382
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm fishing.

383
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,760
I'm too good.

384
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Wait, what do I hear?

385
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,260
Dolphin?

386
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,400
Those are big.

387
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,360
Those are whales.

388
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,700
Not dolphins.

389
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,180
Whales?

390
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,380
This place has such a rich ecosystem.

391
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,740
That wasn't me.

392
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,300
I don't believe you.

393
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,420
I don't believe you.

394
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,120
Wait.

395
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,600
Uh-oh.

396
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,800
I'm starting to get...

397
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,920
I think we need to go home.

398
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Hot dog.

399
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Indeed.

400
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,160
I'm a gamer.

401
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,000
It's fine.

402
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,840
Is it?

403
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Toggle lights by E.

404
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,340
Light up the night.

405
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,740
Helps you see but makes you more visible.

406
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,500
What is that?

407
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,300
That's kind of scary.

408
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
I don't like that.

409
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,840
That's kind of spooky.

410
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,280
What do you mean I'm more visible?

411
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,960
To what?

412
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,980
To the people.

413
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,660
I did...

414
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,740
What does that mean?

415
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,860
What's that?

416
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,040
Oh, it's gone.

417
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,860
Oh, never mind.

418
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,160
It's totally still there.

419
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,360
Wait, my light is on, right?

420
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,180
I can't tell.

421
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,420
Toggle...

422
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,340
Oh, with right click.

423
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,420
Oh, I see, I see.

424
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,180
Okay, just kidding.

425
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:32,800
We're fine.

426
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,300
I don't need it on.

427
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,520
What's that sound?

428
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,540
Increases my panic.

429
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,560
Bright lights and sleep will reduce it.

430
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,600
What am I panicking for?

431
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,680
Look, there's fish right here.

432
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,900
This is fine.

433
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,880
There's fish right here.

434
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,980
You hear something?

435
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,480
No.

436
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,860
We're night fishing now.

437
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,800
Oh, uh...

438
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,000
Arrow squid.

439
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,080
Nice.

440
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,580
What's this?

441
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,320
Oh, I gotta get this repaired.

442
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:08,680
Okay.

443
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
More squid.

444
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,300
More squid.

445
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,900
How late can I go?

446
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,700
Can I just fish until my heart is content?

447
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,660
Keep watch on my eye meter.

448
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,600
Is it so bad right now?

449
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
What is that over there?

450
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,120
Look, we're like in the...

451
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,100
in the little inner coastal spot.

452
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,320
What?

453
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,360
What's going on?

454
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,340
I think I'm panicking.

455
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,100
Um, hello?

456
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,050
Don't hurt the ship, please.

457
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,310
How do I dock?

458
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,890
Oh, F.

459
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,910
I made it!

460
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,490
Yes, but watch your sanity.

461
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,390
I can't really tell when it's going low.

462
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,330
I just see my eyeball going freaky.

463
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,090
You step onto the dock at Greater Marrow.

464
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,330
I keep wanting to say...

465
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,390
Minnow.

466
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,130
I like small, cozy little towns like this.

467
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,830
You also like losing your sanity.

468
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,390
The mayor is waiting nearby.

469
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,330
Ah, I've seen you returned in one...

470
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,950
Oh, it is one piece!

471
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,610
Before you head off to town, we should discuss the matter of your boat.

472
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,090
As I mentioned earlier, your old boat was too badly damaged to repair.

473
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,170
However, I'm more than happy to sell you that replacement vessel, yours to own.

474
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,570
It's real.

475
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,790
It's real!

476
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,970
Oh my god.

477
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,150
The official dredge stream from Maiden Minnow.

478
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,610
I can't get any...

479
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,490
better...

480
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,230
than this!

481
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,290
What do you mean?

482
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,130
Are you seeing things?

483
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,410
I'm not seeing anything!

484
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,370
Actually, I truly am not seeing anything.

485
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,330
I kinda wanna see something spooky.

486
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,170
Something will happen.

487
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,850
We'll make it.

488
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,810
I understand you may not have the necessary funds on hand, so we'll consider it a loan.

489
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,370
But I wanna make this easy for you.

490
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,450
Until your debt is repaid, a tiny portion of your fish sales will go towards paying it off.

491
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,610
A small amount of interest will go towards improving the town.

492
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,430
Wait...

493
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,790
So you're splitting it three ways?

494
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,370
You're...

495
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,640
You're gonna take...

496
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,910
some for the boat...

497
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,650
and then some for the town.

498
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,290
And then...

499
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,610
I get the...

500
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,250
What a scam.

501
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,550
What if I was just like, nah, I don't wanna be a fisherman anymore.

502
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,410
I'm just gonna chill here now.

503
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,090
How much is a small amount?

504
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,430
Can we talk percent, please?

505
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,670
Thank you so much, TV's brand, for the five gets a thank you.

506
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:33,210
So to recap, you'll need to sell fish to the local market, paying off your debt, and in turn keeping the population fed and satisfied.

507
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,110
Understand?

508
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,950
Where do I sell the fish?

509
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,090
Our local fish...

510
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,790
Our lotion.

511
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,730
Our local fishmonger, he's covered in lotion.

512
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,070
He's like...

513
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,730
You can just see this guy like...

514
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,610
He's like walking up to you.

515
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,050
Like, you know how when you put on a bunch of sunscreen?

516
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,090
Or rather, old sunscreen, right?

517
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:04,170
And it had like that white, like super goopy white texture.

518
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,430
He's just covered in that.

519
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,870
You can't even see his face.

520
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,690
No wonder he's so slippery.

521
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,750
Fill with praise and purchase what you catch.

522
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,310
He's open all hours.

523
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,030
Off you go, then.

524
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,830
Sell those fish while they're still fresh.

525
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:19,830
Okay.

526
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,410
Oh.

527
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,010
Ew.

528
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,010
You enter a squalid shack on the fringe of the marketplace.

529
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,450
The familiar smell of fish...

530
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,210
I'm trying.

531
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,130
I'd rather not.

532
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,330
Thank you so much for the 10 gift.

533
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,310
Thank you.

534
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,590
It rubs the lotion on its skin.

535
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,230
Not the hearts.

536
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,420
The familiar smell of fish fills the air.

537
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,940
That's like a tongue twister, no?

538
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,160
So much... So much alliteration.

539
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,200
Flies buzz haphazardly around the downcast man behind the counter.

540
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,640
Surprised they found a new one so fast.

541
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,340
What happened to the other one?

542
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,840
Hey, it takes a certain type of person to last out here.

543
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,720
It's not a life for everyone.

544
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,660
Anyway, to business.

545
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,240
I'll pay you for fish.

546
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,320
Bigger and fresher means more money.

547
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,060
Some species are just worth more, too.

548
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,960
Ghost goes minted?

549
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,300
Other towns on other islands might pay you different.

550
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,120
While you've still got a debt outstanding here, I'd suggest you work on paying it off first.

551
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,200
My special fish!

552
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,940
So let's see what you've got.

553
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,180
Alright, I've got this guy.

554
00:28:59,320 --> 00:28:59,960
Sell.

555
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,320
How much are you... $12!

556
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,160
Nice, nice.

557
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:05,720
Sell.

558
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,700
What if, like, as I'm standing here, they're depreciating in value?

559
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,180
How much debt do I owe?

560
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Oh wait, there's a sell all fish.

561
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,220
We doing numbers.

562
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:19,920
Oh yeah.

563
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,180
Bye, fish!

564
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,880
Nice.

565
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,800
Is that it?

566
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,800
The mayor is standing outside the fishmonger's store.

567
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,020
Excellent work.

568
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,580
I have no doubt you'll be able to provide for this town.

569
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,760
Look here.

570
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,320
I found this down by the docks.

571
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,160
I'm sure someone like you could make something out of it.

572
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,320
Why don't you take it?

573
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,780
Ooh, research pod.

574
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,360
Oh, one last thing.

575
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,260
Our local shipwright mentioned she might be able to make some modifications to your ship.

576
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,640
You should pay her a visit.

577
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,380
Is this guy stalking us?

578
00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,880
For real?

579
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,980
As you walk into the yard, you see the shipwright making...

580
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,100
Sorry.

581
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,480
Making repairs to a damaged hull.

582
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,180
She looks at you briefly before turning back to her work.

583
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,880
Oh, complete the introduction quest.

584
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,260
You must be the new fisherman.

585
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,860
I can make improvements to your vessel in the yard.

586
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,420
Mind you, I'm not in the business of doing favors around here.

587
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,160
Payment is up front and everything takes time to install.

588
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Also, if you take any damage from the rocks...

589
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,560
Damage?

590
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,880
Couldn't be me.

591
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,900
I would never.

592
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,440
No, ma'am.

593
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,480
You have my fisherman's vow.

594
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,060
I'll never damage my sweep.

595
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,420
Now, yeah, a rock might attack me.

596
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,000
That would not be my fault.

597
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,270
You know?

598
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,030
Any damage at all, I can patch it up.

599
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,370
Mostly.

600
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,250
She shrugs and gestures towards the hull she's currently attempting to repair.

601
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,930
A number of wooden boards, all well above the waterline, are splintered and scratched.

602
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,090
Take a look around.

603
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,470
Just remember, the bigger the equipment, the longer it takes to install.

604
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,650
So plan ahead.

605
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,650
Wait, so we can even get better...

606
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,410
My current thing is coastal, but we could get shallow stuff.

607
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,910
I only have 80 bucks.

608
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,510
Daniel, welcome to membership.

609
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,750
Thank you so much!

610
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,850
We also got better motors.

611
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,770
Maybe I should have done a better job fishing.

612
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,590
I'm gonna die.

613
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,890
Oh my god.

614
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,170
These are so expensive.

615
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,490
We need some investigation at a dock first.

616
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,650
Can she look at this stuff for me?

617
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,630
I think I have to come back.

618
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,610
Well, we can repair this.

619
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,510
Repair all.

620
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,450
Okay.

621
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,210
I at least repaired that.

622
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,970
Boat goes minted.

623
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,950
Boat goes minted.

624
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,550
Oh look, we only have 35 dollars remaining.

625
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,190
We're actually killing it.

626
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,570
And then we also got our special message.

627
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,430
We had a slight accident yesterday around the shallows at the back of Greater Morrow.

628
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,650
A rock seemingly... See, that's what I'm talking about!

629
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,770
A rock seemingly appeared out of nowhere and struck the front of the boat.

630
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,650
See?

631
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,390
The rocks do attack.

632
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:54,150
It did not penetrate the hull, but it jostled us around, and a few items fell overboard into the water.

633
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,710
We did not see what they were, which is of some concern.

634
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,530
But we believe all important articles are accounted for.

635
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,310
He has been checking over some notes from the boat renaming ceremony.

636
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,650
He is paranoid that he performed the steps incorrectly.

637
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,590
I've never known him to be so superstitious.

638
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:12,830
Who's he?

639
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,230
I love my hat.

640
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:17,650
Thanks.

641
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,970
Thank you for the 50 yen.

642
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,630
Thank you.

643
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,270
Boo's Pro Shops.

644
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,170
Thank you so much.

645
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,430
Okay.

646
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,270
Encyclopedia.

647
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:39,210
So we're gonna wanna save up some money so we can get things that are not just coastal fishies.

648
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,980
I guess we sleep.

649
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,280
This is also making me wanna play Dave the Diver.

650
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,670
Alrighty.

651
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,870
Back on the ground.

652
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,810
Back on the ground, back on the ground.

653
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,210
We're gonna go...

654
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,550
Right over here.

655
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,250
Wait, what's that?

656
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,290
A floating buoy.

657
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,250
Buoy!

658
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,390
Did you finish Dave the Diver?

659
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,470
I did, actually.

660
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,550
But there's been so many DLC.

661
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,050
For Dave the Diver, it's kind of insane.

662
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,810
It serves to mark safe passage past dangerous rocks and obscured hazards.

663
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,650
Its dim light also provides a brief respite in the gloom of the night.

664
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,310
The music is so relaxing.

665
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,110
What the heck.

666
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,570
I'm fishing.

667
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,690
Just kidding.

668
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,170
Yeah, there was Godzilla DLC.

669
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:56,210
Okay, I need to learn my lesson about what's shallow waters and not, you know.

670
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,130
This is not shallow waters.

671
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:00,730
Okay.

672
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,570
But we get, like, better fish if we wait until night.

673
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,690
Yeah, the Yakuza DLC!

674
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,990
What if we just fish over and over again?

675
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,070
Until...

676
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:22,810
Until...

677
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,250
Thank you for the Akasuba!

678
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,990
Hold on, hold on.

679
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,970
Token of appreciation.

680
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:35,210
I don't watch a lot of live streams because I work a lot, but I do watch a lot of clips.

681
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,350
Thank you!

682
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,330
I wanted to stop and say thank you for all your hard work.

683
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,050
Many hours spent entertaining everyone, thank you!

684
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,890
Quiet time, thank you!

685
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,970
Really appreciate it.

686
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,110
Thank you so much.

687
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,590
Good luck with work!

688
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:53,850
Welcome back.

689
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:54,530
Thanks!

690
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,010
Molly!

691
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,570
Molly, I missed your... I don't know, I'm so sorry.

692
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:02,970
It's your birthday.

693
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,670
Happy birthday to you!

694
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,410
Happy birthday to you!

695
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,210
Happy birthday, dear Molly!

696
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,690
Happy birthday to you!

697
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,690
Happy birthday!

698
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,420
Sorry I missed it.

699
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,390
I'm Muramasa because I'm a ghost on a ship?

700
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,930
So true!

701
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,630
Not Muramasa, Murasa.

702
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,950
Where am I?

703
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,670
Where's home?

704
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,690
That's home.

705
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,730
I got a little twisted for a second.

706
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,810
These are the twisty fish.

707
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,370
Twisty.

708
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,050
Twist them around.

709
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,430
Twisty.

710
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,670
Get it twisted.

711
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,770
No, don't!

712
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:08,890
Sorry.

713
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,870
Sorry, fish.

714
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,670
Look, they're like... they're spooning.

715
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,170
Gone fishing.

716
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,970
This is the realest I've ever gone fishing.

717
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,250
Gone fishing Rio.

718
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,830
Not clickbait.

719
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,070
Can I get this one or is it too shallow, I wonder.

720
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,010
This one doesn't look too shallow.

721
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,870
Wait, these look big over there, no?

722
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,010
Those look like some big old...

723
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:36,250
What?

724
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,870
No, I think this is the...

725
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,770
Yeah, this is just a mackerel.

726
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,370
Hold on, let's go over here.

727
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,450
Where are these big guys?

728
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,990
Some big ones right here.

729
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,150
What was that sound?

730
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,450
Hello?

731
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,300
Oceanic.

732
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,340
I can't get it yet.

733
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,100
Dang it.

734
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,720
Oh, there's a message.

735
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,340
Sharks.

736
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,640
I collected it.

737
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,680
OK, I guess we just gotta save up.

738
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,220
Dang it.

739
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,280
I'm ready to explore, papa.

740
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,300
Please, I'm not a child anymore.

741
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,000
Please, papa.

742
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,620
Let me explore the ocean blue.

743
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,700
But we do want to save also.

744
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,300
OK, it's starting to get dark.

745
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:36,720
Nice.

746
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,620
We want to save a little bit so that...

747
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,540
Or rather some room so when we get to the spooky things, right?

748
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,020
Which we're almost there.

749
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,520
Can we sell these fish and come back later?

750
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,440
Oh, I didn't think about that.

751
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,600
Probably?

752
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,080
Am I safe in here?

753
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,800
Am I safe?

754
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,260
Yet another graduation joke.

755
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,120
Let's see.

756
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,120
Hopefully we didn't just waste our night, you know?

757
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,940
I've had a special order come through from a customer.

758
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,400
If you can fulfill it, I'll pay you above normal prices.

759
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,040
Tell me about the order.

760
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,740
One gold flounder and one grey eel.

761
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,460
Alright, you'll need to have a rod that can handle shallow water.

762
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,220
Shipwright should be able to sort that out for me.

763
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,700
OK, we got to sell our fish.

764
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,540
101 dollars.

765
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,320
You're always safe when you're docked.

766
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,580
Alright.

767
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,400
Return to town.

768
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,500
Undock!

769
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,440
OK.

770
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,160
It's just a little night.

771
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,140
Look, we're like right here.

772
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,880
If I just...

773
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,960
If I just fish right here, we'll always know which way home is.

774
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,200
It's all lit up and bright.

775
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,380
OK, we got some squid.

776
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,560
Oh, depleted.

777
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,340
That's so sad.

778
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,340
Uh...

779
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,320
Assophobia.

780
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,880
What does that mean?

781
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,650
What's the worst that could happen?

782
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,250
Oh, what's my...

783
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,650
Wait, it's...

784
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,710
I do it and then...

785
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,490
Oh, right click.

786
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:50,930
That's right.

787
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,690
Hello, fish!

788
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,170
Hello, fish!

789
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,110
Can I still see home?

790
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,350
OK, we can still see home.

791
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,410
We're OK.

792
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:03,930
Fish!

793
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,550
Glub glub.

794
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,730
Glub glub.

795
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:09,890
Fish!

796
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,510
I can still see home.

797
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,090
We're OK.

798
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,170
Glub glub.

799
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,190
Glub glub.

800
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,590
Glub glub.

801
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,550
Fish here?

802
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,090
Oh, my light went out.

803
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,590
Maybe I should go home.

804
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,210
I'm scared.

805
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,330
I'm scared!

806
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,510
I'm going home.

807
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,030
I'm going home!

808
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,930
I'm scared.

809
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,610
Oh, it's the rocks that appear out of nowhere.

810
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,850
Oh, it's the rocks that attack.

811
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,930
That's what comes out?

812
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,010
No, no, no.

813
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,310
No, no, no.

814
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,470
No, no, no.

815
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,970
Oh, no, no.

816
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,290
We're docking.

817
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,470
What was that?

818
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,810
I'm docked.

819
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,790
I'm docked!

820
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,030
Why are you here?

821
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,210
I've come to fish.

822
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,810
There's nothing here for someone like you anymore.

823
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,690
Do yourself a favor and move on.

824
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:37,150
She turns and shuffles back along the path that leads to the light.

825
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,830
I got one squid.

826
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,130
Sell that guy.

827
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,470
Some is better than none, right?

828
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,070
Now we should be able to buy...

829
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,790
150.

830
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,230
OK.

831
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,530
Catch is shallow.

832
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,250
40% We should be good with a better one.

833
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,490
How do I do the research?

834
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:12,810
Fish fear me.

835
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:13,490
I fear fish.

836
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:20,910
Our mutual antipathy prevents us from finding inner peace.

837
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,990
Gear icon at the dock.

838
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:24,590
Oh, OK.

839
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,010
Thank you.

840
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:25,750
Alright.

841
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,290
I will do that.

842
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,270
Let's see.

843
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,350
Let's buy this, though.

844
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,630
Rotate.

845
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,190
Nevermind.

846
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,270
Oh, I have to put it in here.

847
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:37,630
OK.

848
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:39,410
Hello?

849
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,170
Ah, there we go.

850
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:41,510
OK.

851
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,110
Installing.

852
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,030
OK.

853
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,590
Gear icon.

854
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:47,250
Research.

855
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,950
What does this do?

856
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,030
Oh!

857
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:56,370
Flexible.

858
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,850
I should have maybe not bought the new rod.

859
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,750
Wisp monger.

860
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,070
How much for one fellow wisp?

861
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,680
Live and learn?

862
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,180
I'm literally dead.

863
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,040
Everyone does that?

864
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,500
Glad to know that.

865
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,740
Everybody... Well, you know what?

866
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,160
Then I'm gonna do this one.

867
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,060
Rather than this one.

868
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
We'll do this one.

869
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,440
So we can now get the oceanic fish, too.

870
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,500
So we got the shallow, we got the oceanic, we got...

871
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,580
Wait, do I have to pay for that?

872
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,200
Oh, it's really expensive.

873
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:42,700
OK.

874
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,260
Interesting.

875
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:44,720
Alright.

876
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,740
Undock time.

877
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:50,500
Let's go.

878
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,900
Oh, I forgot to also look at my...

879
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,520
My messages.

880
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,540
Morning of the second day of the honeymoon.

881
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,260
Mare ignored.

882
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,160
Wait, was he there?

883
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,500
Oops.

884
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,920
Sorry, Mare.

885
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,540
And our first day proper.

886
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,880
Mare wants to speak with you.

887
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,080
OK.

888
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,680
Today we're sailing around the islands and inlets at the back of Great Mara.

889
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,200
I love the rocks here.

890
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,520
The layers and colors are so striking.

891
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,200
Furthermore, the fishing is relatively poor in these shallows.

892
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,920
So I know he will keep his hands on the wheel instead of the rods.

893
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,660
This man can't stop gripping his rods.

894
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,680
He renamed the boat last night.

895
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,540
Julie.

896
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,880
He did a fancy renaming ceremony and everything.

897
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,320
I think he took that more seriously than the wedding.

898
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:55,780
Supposedly, it's very important to perform it correctly, lest you want ill fortune to follow the vessel.

899
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,960
He wanted to throw away everything with the old name on it.

900
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,840
But I kept the keychain Ocean... Oh, keychain.

901
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,840
Ocean's Riches was a good name.

902
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,040
I wonder if that's why the boat was cursed.

903
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,120
You're not supposed to keep anything with the old name.

904
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,620
I think he has prepared a surprise picnic lunch.

905
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,020
I can see the basket half hidden, stuffed under a blanket at the front of the cabin.

906
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,400
I love it when he tries to be romantic.

907
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,600
And then we gotta get the flounder eel.

908
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,140
Let's go into shallow stuff.

909
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,220
Am I gonna die by thunderstorm?

910
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,680
Lightning?

911
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,820
Did you sleep?

912
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,240
I did.

913
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,140
I did, I did.

914
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,820
What is this thing?

915
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,460
I was gonna say this looks like a flounder.

916
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,500
Let's just deplete this area, I guess.

917
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,100
They're kinda big though.

918
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,980
It's bigger than I anticipated.

919
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:13,970
Fish.

920
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,870
It's bigger than I anticipated.

921
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,310
Oh, I just noticed the stock too.

922
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:19,830
Gosh, okay.

923
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,030
I gotta pay more attention.

924
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,230
I had a freaking heart attack checking Twitter today.

925
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:25,090
I'm sorry.

926
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,370
I'm apologizing even though I didn't even do anything.

927
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,590
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

928
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,630
I didn't even do anything.

929
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:51,750
Oh, the music in this game is so nice.

930
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,430
Is this a shallow spot?

931
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,290
No, it's a coastal spot.

932
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,890
How did it all start anyway?

933
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:01,770
I don't know.

934
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,710
I saw... Oh, the eel!

935
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,130
Nice.

936
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,550
Oh, he's kinda big.

937
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,010
I think I need to go sell.

938
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,150
I saw... I saw Lewood comment.

939
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,230
And that's how I saw it start.

940
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,910
But apparently it started before that.

941
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,370
I think somebody retweeted it.

942
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,080
So, essentially for those who don't know...

943
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:36,010
Somebody retweeted my graduation announcement from 2021.

944
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,970
So...

945
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,370
If you see people saying...

946
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,910
Oh, I can't believe Minto is graduating.

947
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:45,950
I'm not!

948
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,510
And now I'm getting messages from people who are just like...

949
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,510
Oh, you're graduating?

950
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,030
Oh my gosh.

951
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,290
Please don't go.

952
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,670
But I'm not.

953
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,530
Let's go to the fish.

954
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,630
You got fish for that order?

955
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:09,010
Yes.

956
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,350
Just leave whatever you have here.

957
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,730
I'll keep the order on ice until it's all ready to go.

958
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,590
You...

959
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:17,570
You...

960
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,310
Hands me... Oh nice.

961
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:19,890
Good, good.

962
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,130
I should be pleased with these.

963
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,810
I've got another order here.

964
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:23,990
This one is a little more curious.

965
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,490
They want a couple of squid and a whole black grouper.

966
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,070
I don't think I've gotten that yet.

967
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,010
Don't go Minto!

968
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,890
But yeah, everything is fine!

969
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,550
Please!

970
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,970
I was like, should I delete the old post?

971
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,530
But it's my history.

972
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:44,730
I can't delete it.

973
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,420
I can't delete it.

974
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,220
It's my history.

975
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:06,120
Twitter be trying to cause population control through wisp heart attacks?

976
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,360
No!

977
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,160
Someone is going to get mad at me.

978
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:11,940
I feel it.

979
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,520
They're going to be like, I can't believe she would joke about that.

980
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,520
Graduation jokes are the worst.

981
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:22,640
I can't believe she would, she would, she would toy with my feelings.

982
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,920
Please, it's a reminder we would miss you.

983
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,820
I can still hear her voice.

984
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,480
Hello!

985
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,800
It's like way less dramatic than I thought it would be.

986
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,680
I'm back!

987
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,180
Hello!

988
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:57,000
It's the Minto of your future!

989
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:10,560
I have come to say...

990
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,700
Say...

991
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,560
Follow the five second rule!

992
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,060
After you drop the pickles...

993
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:34,180
You will get sex...

994
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,000
There you go.

995
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,060
Anyway, don't see many people fishing squids these days.

996
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,060
They only feed at night.

997
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,340
And well, you know what nights are like around here.

998
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,140
Good luck!

999
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,120
Do I?

1000
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,980
Alright, we're selling all the fish.

1001
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,140
Okay.

1002
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,820
How much debt do I have left?

1003
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,680
Only ten dollars remaining!

1004
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:00,720
Nice!

1005
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,540
Nice, nice.

1006
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,120
Tell everyone that tweets you about graduation that their message convinced you to stay.

1007
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,460
You know, yeah.

1008
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,680
Your message convinced me.

1009
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,120
Thank you.

1010
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,880
Thank you, Twitter user.

1011
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,500
Where was the... Oh, here he is.

1012
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,400
That's the person I was hoping to see.

1013
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,140
Will you be sailing out east towards Little Merrill?

1014
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,620
Would you give this package to the dock worker?

1015
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:31,740
Oh, okay.

1016
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,220
I got a small package.

1017
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,000
The mayor hands you a small damp package bound in string.

1018
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,620
It's dripping slightly.

1019
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,600
Should we look up...

1020
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,160
Real squid fishing?

1021
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,120
The dock worker will pay you upon delivery.

1022
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,300
Please be quick about it.

1023
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,240
I don't want it to spoil.

1024
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,080
Oh, okay.

1025
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,620
Alright, to the east!

1026
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,580
To the east, to the east.

1027
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,680
Okay, to the east.

1028
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,360
To the east.

1029
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,240
We're heading north.

1030
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,680
So I need to go...

1031
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,120
Wait.

1032
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,200
No.

1033
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:09,880
Wait.

1034
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,620
I'm heading east.

1035
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,400
I thought the...

1036
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,340
I thought the actual little spinny thing would point to the direction.

1037
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,500
Not...

1038
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,020
Not the compass itself.

1039
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,740
You know what I mean?

1040
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,740
Yeah, straight line.

1041
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,660
All the way across.

1042
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,660
We're gonna get paid, so it's worth it, I think.

1043
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,340
Okay.

1044
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,040
This is correct, right?

1045
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,660
Hello.

1046
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:46,640
What?

1047
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,360
A delivery?

1048
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,440
Let's see here.

1049
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,500
He tears a small hole in the paper and peeks inside.

1050
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,580
You can't say for sure, but it feels as though he's shielding it from your view.

1051
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,020
It's human meat.

1052
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,820
Yeah, nice and fresh.

1053
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,120
This'll do nicely.

1054
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,660
I'm to pay you, I suppose.

1055
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,300
25 bucks.

1056
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,220
I was given this old book a few weeks back, but it didn't make much sense to me.

1057
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,000
You'll surely get more use out of it.

1058
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:11,980
A book.

1059
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,920
The number of pages are folded over.

1060
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,540
This too is a Strand-type game.

1061
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,420
Keep it in your cabin.

1062
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,320
Perhaps you can read it while you're on the water.

1063
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,480
Stop by for a chat any time.

1064
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,500
You know how lonely it can be.

1065
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,280
Wait, I can sleep here?

1066
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,460
Traitor.

1067
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,280
You enter a brightly lit shop.

1068
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,300
It's packed with antiques.

1069
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,200
The shelves are full of jewelry and other baobles.

1070
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:41,720
Baobles!

1071
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,180
An old man peers at you over silver spectacles.

1072
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,620
Is that...?

1073
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:49,620
No.

1074
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,540
I don't believe we've met.

1075
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,260
Forgive me, my eyes aren't what they used to be.

1076
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,440
Baobles.

1077
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,240
Baobles.

1078
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,200
I specialize in antiques and jewelry.

1079
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,200
I'll purchase any special trinkets you happen to have.

1080
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,420
Have you got anything nice with you today, perhaps?

1081
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:07,660
No.

1082
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,880
I got nothing.

1083
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,020
I'm poor.

1084
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,070
Let's get a few more fish.

1085
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,510
Then we'll head home.

1086
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:20,990
Right?

1087
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,990
We're almost out of debt.

1088
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,550
It's so important.

1089
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,810
Alright, we got a car.

1090
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,230
Alright.

1091
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,310
Oh, depleted already?

1092
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,850
The sundown feels so ominous here.

1093
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,550
Sounds like a plan.

1094
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:48,730
It is a plan.

1095
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,430
I'm the man with the plan.

1096
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,390
I'm the ghost.

1097
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,850
Is it already night?

1098
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,470
The squids are out.

1099
00:55:59,530 --> 00:55:59,970
Oh yeah.

1100
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,510
The little... What's it called?

1101
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,210
The eyeballs out.

1102
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,790
But what's in the water here at night?

1103
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,550
What if I just fish?

1104
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,450
And I don't leave.

1105
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,710
Will something still get me?

1106
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,310
The spot is depleted.

1107
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,450
It's starting to get dark.

1108
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:34,870
9PM.

1109
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,670
What's this shiny over there?

1110
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,050
What happens in these waters?

1111
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,970
Only one way to find out.

1112
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,530
Oh no!

1113
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:49,910
I lost an eel!

1114
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,250
I couldn't turn!

1115
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,910
That rock came out of nowhere!

1116
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:58,850
What?

1117
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,450
That rock came out of nowhere.

1118
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:02,870
That was craziness.

1119
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,230
Did you guys see that?

1120
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,250
These rocks do be attacking.

1121
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,290
Oh, yes I do?

1122
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:14,370
What did I get?

1123
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:16,890
Oh no, I lost one.

1124
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,350
He'll have it on ice.

1125
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,330
I need to get this black grouper.

1126
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,350
It's a shallow guy.

1127
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:30,710
Regular business.

1128
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,310
Sell all fish.

1129
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,110
We did it!

1130
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,770
I'm seeing things, I am.

1131
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,970
You actually do be attacking.

1132
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,310
The mayor is walking quickly towards you.

1133
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:46,490
He seems to be in a good mood.

1134
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,790
With a spring in his step.

1135
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:49,930
Fantastic news.

1136
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,010
Thanks partly to your efforts, Greater Maru is growing.

1137
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,030
Our town is sure to be swarming with visitors any day now.

1138
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:00,410
In fact, I've granted a consent for the shipwright to expand her facilities.

1139
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,210
The old dry dock is operational again.

1140
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,950
Yeah, we paid off Tom Nook.

1141
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,190
We're homeowners now.

1142
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,510
This is the best fishing sim.

1143
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,010
No, I'm sorry I scared you.

1144
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,510
I missed the other one and the goodbye.

1145
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,070
I was at work when I found out.

1146
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:26,870
I'm sorry.

1147
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,090
Please have fun and enjoy the rest of the day.

1148
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,090
I'm sorry.

1149
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:36,510
I'm sorry.

1150
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,330
I've also allocated some money to improve the fishmonger's services.

1151
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,450
He might have something to talk to you about soon.

1152
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:47,350
Keep up the good work.

1153
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,410
We're glad you've chosen to be here with us.

1154
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:51,790
Lucky dry dock.

1155
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,770
Juliet, we can make significant improvements to your vessel here.

1156
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,790
We're talking extra space.

1157
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,730
More attachment points for equipment and even superior hulls.

1158
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,550
I wish I still had time to say...

1159
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:07,470
Say what?

1160
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:11,130
Say... Say whaaaaat?

1161
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,650
Say whaaaaat?

1162
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:17,490
We need a decent stock of hard materials for these projects.

1163
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:18,570
Lumber, metal scraps...

1164
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,110
It's time to dredge!

1165
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,710
How do I get materials?

1166
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:27,550
There's plenty of decent materials around the coast from various shipwrecks and the like.

1167
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:29,230
I'm sure you'll find a way to get at them.

1168
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:37,190
Materials assigned towards upgrades here will be stored.

1169
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,270
So don't worry if you only have half of what we need.

1170
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:41,470
Whoa!

1171
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,110
Okay.

1172
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,510
Let's save that for another time.

1173
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,930
I want to save up for...

1174
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,950
I want to save up for this hydraulic rod.

1175
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:57,110
But I guess we also need to learn how to dredge.

1176
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,330
Anything... What's the engines like?

1177
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,650
Mine is also old and rusty.

1178
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,290
Oh, I have a peculiar engine.

1179
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,590
These are rusty engines.

1180
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,270
We could get another engine.

1181
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,270
This is the nets.

1182
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:21,430
These are lights.

1183
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,130
Cloudy lens.

1184
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,130
These are so expensive!

1185
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,590
You can get multiple engines.

1186
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,710
Yeah, yeah, that's what I was just looking at because there's another slot right here.

1187
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,200
We could get it.

1188
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,020
And we can go pretty fast.

1189
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,960
Okay, I'm going to get it and I'm also going to repair.

1190
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:48,960
Install.

1191
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,800
I'm going to repair our ship.

1192
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:54,680
Okay.

1193
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,160
Two engines, baby!

1194
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,160
We are so fast.

1195
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,660
We are so strong.

1196
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,020
What else did I get?

1197
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:03,580
Oh, the book.

1198
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,080
That's right.

1199
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,020
Sustainable fishing.

1200
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,840
Read to unlock.

1201
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,480
Selected as active book.

1202
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,140
Time passed.

1203
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,320
Passed time to read.

1204
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,320
Okay, cool.

1205
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,640
Let's go to sleep.

1206
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,740
We'll read in our dreams.

1207
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,100
It's me listening to my audio books at night.

1208
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,460
And we're off!

1209
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,380
Let's go try and find that...

1210
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,260
Oh my gosh, it already feels like we're faster.

1211
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,500
Let's go try and find that group.

1212
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
What are we trying to get, actually?

1213
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,060
Hold on, there's some stuff over here.

1214
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,640
This looks...

1215
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,820
I'm drifting.

1216
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,480
What is this?

1217
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,820
Oh no, wait, is this dredging?

1218
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,020
I can't do it yet.

1219
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,940
Squid and grouper.

1220
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:53,700
Yes.

1221
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,320
Squid and grouper.

1222
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,080
These are oceanic, right?

1223
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,360
Wait, what do you mean I don't have the right equipment?

1224
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,060
Oh, I didn't buy it.

1225
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,020
I knew that.

1226
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,740
I knew that.

1227
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,000
Maybe he's like a night time guy.

1228
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,360
In the shallow areas.

1229
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,700
I just got unlucky before.

1230
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,440
Music in this game is some of my fave.

1231
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,600
It's so nice.

1232
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,600
It's very chill.

1233
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,560
Despite how...

1234
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,820
I guess spooky this game kind of is.

1235
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,080
Hmm.

1236
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,820
Maybe we fish close and we wait for night.

1237
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,860
And we sell and then we come back.

1238
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,070
The water.

1239
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:57,530
It's so deep sounding.

1240
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:01,410
Oh, what?

1241
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,550
I feel like I hit that.

1242
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,450
I feel like I hit that.

1243
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,280
Everything in this game is totally vanilla.

1244
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,640
Yeah.

1245
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,200
The spooky rocks.

1246
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,200
I saw one spooky rock.

1247
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,860
I wasn't scared even a little bit.

1248
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,300
Let's just get some stuff.

1249
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,320
Make some money.

1250
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,540
Actually, we keep everything that we make now, which is great.

1251
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:36,880
Yay!

1252
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,500
Special fish.

1253
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,360
Let's just go sell it.

1254
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,700
Okay.

1255
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,620
What's that kanji?

1256
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,400
I can't read.

1257
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:55,920
Futo what?

1258
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,280
Sorry, my kanji is so bad.

1259
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,740
Actually stupid.

1260
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,400
Yippee!

1261
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:07,800
Futomomo.

1262
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,120
Sorry.

1263
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,820
It's not because I couldn't read it on the tiny monitor or anything.

1264
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,440
So many fish are being caught.

1265
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:19,800
Yippee!

1266
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:20,860
That was the real catch.

1267
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,020
Gulp.

1268
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,220
Futomomo, I love you.

1269
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,020
Futomomo, I love you.

1270
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,160
I think everybody here would agree, right?

1271
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,860
Everybody loves size here.

1272
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,300
Tiny monitor doesn't support kanji.

1273
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,440
My brain doesn't support kanji.

1274
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,180
We're undocking.

1275
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,800
We're gonna...

1276
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,780
Am I playing the game right, you guys?

1277
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,480
Is this how you're supposed to play the game?

1278
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,980
Am I doing alright?

1279
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,340
There's like no shallow...

1280
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,940
Wait, this part is sparkly over here.

1281
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,660
I wanted to see it before too.

1282
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,540
I get in.

1283
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,400
Oh, inspect?

1284
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,260
No, wrong way.

1285
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,440
Eyes are better than booba?

1286
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,100
Hey, hey, hey.

1287
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,100
We're not waging war here.

1288
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,380
A lighthouse towers above.

1289
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,660
Waves crash endlessly against the perilous rocks below.

1290
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:39,220
All creatures, human or otherwise, would have their brittle bodies broken and thrown at its feet.

1291
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,900
You ponder the intrinsic power of this structure.

1292
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,660
A vast column of stone, shouldering the responsibility of countless lives.

1293
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,320
How long will it stand?

1294
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,540
How long until it decays into ruin?

1295
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,020
Its purpose exhausted.

1296
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,140
The lighthouse towers above.

1297
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,340
We're getting real philosophical out here.

1298
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,360
I have like not a lot of fishing spots.

1299
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,180
Maybe more will spawn at night.

1300
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:10,720
Hopefully.

1301
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:16,620
Hopefully.

1302
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,020
The ocean does that to ya.

1303
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,460
I guess so.

1304
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:26,600
Depleted.

1305
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,320
There is literally nothing here.

1306
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1307
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,680
I see fish!

1308
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,040
We got the black grouper!

1309
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,740
There is DLC for this game too, right?

1310
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,500
Depleted.

1311
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,820
Turn around?

1312
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,800
How do I turn around?

1313
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:07,300
Reverse, reverse!

1314
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,360
Reverse, reverse!

1315
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,140
Drift!

1316
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:25,230
I would keep going.

1317
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:26,590
It's not that I'm scared or anything.

1318
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,270
I would obviously... I wanna see what that is.

1319
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,030
I would obviously keep going.

1320
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,470
It's just that, you know, like...

1321
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:36,590
I don't have any room left in my thing.

1322
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,430
In my inventory.

1323
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,950
Fishing would be totally pointless.

1324
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:45,870
Yeah, it's not that I'm scared.

1325
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:49,730
It's just that the fishing would be, you know, pointless.

1326
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,820
Still go back out?

1327
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,380
Yeah, but I have like these things to do.

1328
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,400
I do need another squid.

1329
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,180
Come back when you have everything.

1330
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,060
Okay, I found this book.

1331
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,500
I got another book.

1332
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,620
Let's go.

1333
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,740
Hey, why is my chat freezing?

1334
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:29,020
Freezing.

1335
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,040
F5?

1336
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,970
Why is it not working?

1337
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,870
We are frozen.

1338
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:42,630
It's cold.

1339
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,090
Oh, there it is.

1340
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:47,210
I think.

1341
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,350
Ah, there we go.

1342
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,990
What if I undock?

1343
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,230
What if I keep going?

1344
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:55,570
We gotta get the eel.

1345
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,490
We gotta get the eel.

1346
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,310
He's just in another shallow area.

1347
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,570
Like right over here.

1348
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:06,950
Probably.

1349
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,320
Oh my gosh.

1350
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,280
I'm so good.

1351
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,240
What's that?

1352
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,280
I think I should leave.

1353
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:26,960
Nevermind.

1354
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,600
I don't have to get the eel.

1355
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,180
I'm leaving!

1356
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,120
I'm leaving!

1357
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,760
There was... You know what?

1358
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,720
There was an attempt.

1359
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:43,820
Okay everybody?

1360
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,380
There was an attempt.

1361
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,460
I gotta get my beauty rest even.

1362
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,360
How much money do I have?

1363
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,640
79% complete.

1364
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,140
Nice.

1365
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,000
Nah, we'll do this one first.

1366
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,960
I have 200 dollars.

1367
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,400
So not quite.

1368
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,700
Now we have to wait until night time again.

1369
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,420
We have to keep waiting until night.

1370
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,060
I want to go beyond.

1371
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,480
I want to go beyond these waters.

1372
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,900
I want to see the world.

1373
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,200
These other islands.

1374
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,600
Back to the ground.

1375
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,020
What if I go beyond?

1376
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,200
Break the boundaries in due time.

1377
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,680
I'm not a kid anymore papa.

1378
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,840
Please let me go.

1379
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,820
Let me go out and explore the world.

1380
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,560
Is that another boat over there?

1381
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,860
Maybe it's a shipwreck like we saw before.

1382
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:19,600
Corrupted scales and bulbous eyes like nothing you've ever seen before.

1383
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,180
What the hell is that?

1384
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,780
I didn't know that was possible.

1385
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,460
Sustainable fishing.

1386
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,720
What if we go to this island over here?

1387
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,600
Do you think we can make it?

1388
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,780
Can I like... Oh see, I think that's a dock over there, no?

1389
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,030
What's over here?

1390
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,040
It gets freaky.

1391
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,820
It's gonna get freakier.

1392
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,160
I'm so excited.

1393
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,260
So excited for the freaky.

1394
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,640
What are we doing here?

1395
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,760
Steel point.

1396
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,800
Oh, I can't do anything.

1397
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,020
Just kidding.

1398
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,440
Okay, well at least we know we have a place to sleep.

1399
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,620
If we need it.

1400
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,480
All the way out yonder.

1401
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,000
What's that over there?

1402
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,280
Looks like another town maybe?

1403
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,000
I also want to know what that bright light thing is in the...

1404
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,200
Now I have so many questions!

1405
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,700
Free cam.

1406
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,840
It's just like a little rest point.

1407
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:53,140
I don't... Can I fish here or is this considered ocean?

1408
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,220
Coastal.

1409
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,000
We can fish.

1410
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,720
Oh, my bad.

1411
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,000
Oh!

1412
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,160
Wholeseeing god!

1413
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,160
Staring outwards, unblinking eyes borrowed from a larger being.

1414
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:15,400
But not the mind to process what it sees?

1415
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:15,440
Please?

1416
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,140
Is this normal?

1417
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,620
Am I gonna start getting only weirdo fish?

1418
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,240
Depleted.

1419
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,100
Alright.

1420
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,740
Do I have enough... I think I have enough space for the eel.

1421
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,660
We just need to make sure it's shallow water.

1422
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,200
Which I don't see... Oh, wait.

1423
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,320
No, that's not shallow.

1424
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,680
What do I do?

1425
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,600
Why can't I get the fish that I need?

1426
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,200
This game is...

1427
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:01,740
Oh, wait.

1428
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,080
No, just kidding.

1429
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:03,660
It's the squid.

1430
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,200
I'm silly.

1431
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,860
I needed this guy.

1432
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:07,720
Yay!

1433
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:08,680
Now we're good.

1434
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,420
Can't just call them weirdo fish.

1435
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,320
They're doing their best.

1436
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:13,920
My bad.

1437
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,060
Squid, squid, squid.

1438
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:17,540
Yay!

1439
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,100
I was thinking the eel in the shallow.

1440
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,020
Okay, we're good.

1441
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,220
Alright.

1442
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:27,680
I love freaky hags.

1443
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,840
The ghost spirits.

1444
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,980
Hey, all ghost spirits.

1445
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:34,200
Yes.

1446
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:35,580
Alright.

1447
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,860
84 bucks.

1448
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:42,200
Let's go.

1449
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,100
Fishmonger wraps up the fish and hands you some money.

1450
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,980
I didn't think you had it in you.

1451
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,620
Night fishing is a tall order.

1452
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,320
Good meaning to talk to you about a new business venture I've been considering.

1453
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,240
Crab pots.

1454
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,500
Crab pots.

1455
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,580
I've got one here for you.

1456
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:09,680
In fact, it's a little banged up, but you could get it fixed at the shipwright.

1457
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,700
Deploy a crab pot.

1458
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,040
Don't forget where you put it.

1459
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,340
Just drop it out at the sea anywhere, then come back after a day or two to check on it.

1460
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,680
Passive income.

1461
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,760
Mr. Crabs.

1462
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:34,330
Canny time.

1463
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:37,110
I've got a customer after a fiddler crab.

1464
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,190
And a common crab.

1465
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,690
I think if it's a common crab, he can definitely get it himself.

1466
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:44,170
Both species can be found around here.

1467
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,410
What is it today?

1468
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,170
You hand the grotesque fish to the fishmonger.

1469
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:54,610
He grins, raising the fish up to his face before inhaling a deep, stuttering breath.

1470
01:15:55,990 --> 01:16:01,290
Now this is the sort of specimen to liven up my day, I wonder.

1471
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:03,150
Planet Mike.

1472
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,950
Welcome to membership.

1473
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:04,890
Thank you.

1474
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:07,370
Uncommon common crab.

1475
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:14,710
He runs his fingers firmly along the length of the fish, as though feeling for something.

1476
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:22,450
He pushes from one side of its stomach, and a small shape can be seen against the bulging scales.

1477
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:26,210
He slices the fish open.

1478
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:32,090
From its stomach, he pulls a small piece of fabric and spreads it on the counter.

1479
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,190
It's a delicately patterned handkerchief.

1480
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:41,750
Well, I've never seen that before in all my days.

1481
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:42,910
I'll give you this.

1482
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,750
And I'll pay you for the fish, too, of course.

1483
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:46,330
Yeah, you better.

1484
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,310
Too hot for you, too.

1485
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,870
This is how handkerchiefs are harvested.

1486
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,510
It's not the first corrupted fish I've seen in these parts.

1487
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,810
So if you find more before too long, I'll pay you well if you find...

1488
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:01,330
Oh, we can buy more of the crab pots.

1489
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,210
I have one.

1490
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,850
This guy.

1491
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:11,470
He sells for 45 bucks.

1492
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:11,990
Nice.

1493
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,970
Oh, we're so close.

1494
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:18,230
I think.

1495
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:24,980
He wants to get the crabs.

1496
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:26,980
We're having crab tonight.

1497
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:31,000
Crab legs on the house.

1498
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,960
I'll treat you, right?

1499
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,900
I'll go... I'll go... I'll go... I'll go out fishing and I'll get you crab legs for you to eat.

1500
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,680
If that's what you want, baby girl.

1501
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,180
If you want crab legs, I'll go out and fish it myself.

1502
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,460
I'll harvest them myself.

1503
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,320
Sometimes they might be a little grotesque.

1504
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,360
But I know you wouldn't mind.

1505
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,960
Just, you know, be sure to chew properly because you might bite into a handkerchief.

1506
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,520
I'm allergic?

1507
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:07,740
Well, I would serve it if I was attempting to assassinate you.

1508
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,420
Which I'm not.

1509
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:15,560
But I mean, if you ever wanted to be with a ghost, it would probably be easier if you were a ghost.

1510
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,500
But luckily, that's not the case with Minto.

1511
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,080
Fumbled.

1512
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:37,590
Someone's eyeing me from their window.

1513
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:40,530
His face is mostly in shadow.

1514
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:45,070
I know what you took to the fishmonger.

1515
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,190
And I'll be clear.

1516
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:48,750
I know he extracted an artifact from it.

1517
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:51,210
I need to inspect it, but not here.

1518
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,110
Meet me on Blackstone Isle.

1519
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,410
Head out this bay and cut south.

1520
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:59,730
I have a business proposition that you'll want to hear.

1521
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:01,990
I'll be waiting.

1522
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:04,550
South.

1523
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,150
Okay, we gotta go south.

1524
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,570
But...

1525
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,750
Wait, what do you mean my equipment?

1526
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:12,270
Oh, this?

1527
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,870
Oh, it's only $7.50.

1528
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:18,610
Oh, we can buy this!

1529
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,010
But I have to sell something else.

1530
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:28,250
Maybe we sell this rod.

1531
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,390
And then buy this simple skin.

1532
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,150
But then I don't have a coastal rod.

1533
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,170
You can put the rod in storage.

1534
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:42,050
Oh, I can?

1535
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:46,610
Uninstall.

1536
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,410
Oh, storage.

1537
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:51,940
Wait.

1538
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,580
It won't let me go to storage.

1539
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:57,060
Wait.

1540
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,780
Oh, to storage I press both.

1541
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:03,900
Wait, middle?

1542
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,410
What did I just do?

1543
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,150
Okay, okay, I did it.

1544
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:15,010
I did it!

1545
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:15,610
I did it!

1546
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,710
Alright, we're gonna buy this.

1547
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,790
The big bad boy.

1548
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,010
Nice.

1549
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:26,470
Fisherman!

1550
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:28,590
Have you run into a photographer on your travels?

1551
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,930
She docked here a few days ago for supplies.

1552
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:36,450
I suggested that she take some pictures of the town for promotional purposes, but she didn't seem too interested.

1553
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,370
She mentioned she was heading south.

1554
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,010
Oh, that's where I'm going.

1555
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,170
After some Z's.

1556
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:51,310
Back.

1557
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,010
Oh, my...

1558
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,310
Wait, what's this?

1559
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,590
When did I get this?

1560
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,910
Dredge.

1561
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,130
Cod.

1562
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:05,830
Oh, it tells me what the fish are.

1563
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,530
When did I get this?

1564
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:13,150
I just... I see, I see.

1565
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,390
I always had it.

1566
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:15,910
That's so funny.

1567
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:19,950
I'm gonna put it right here.

1568
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:22,290
Okay.

1569
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,650
This is south.

1570
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:26,510
Yup, I figured.

1571
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,010
Many people don't see it.

1572
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,040
That's where we're heading to.

1573
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:45,680
I think.

1574
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,280
But first, we're gonna fish.

1575
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,700
Our first time fishing in the ocean.

1576
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:58,360
We got a bronze whaler.

1577
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,100
That's like the most expensive thing you could get.

1578
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,120
Probably.

1579
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,760
We've got... What else is out here?

1580
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:14,860
Oh, this is coastal.

1581
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:15,960
Nevermind.

1582
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,060
Nevermind.

1583
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,580
I leave you for bigger adventures.

1584
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:26,680
This probably is coastal too.

1585
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:30,920
You see a fellow fishing ship, be sure to honk.

1586
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,260
Really?

1587
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,000
Okay.

1588
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,320
Is that proper etiquette?

1589
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,800
Honk at your neighbors?

1590
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:40,540
Workshop.

1591
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,880
The workshop looks as though it hasn't been used in decades.

1592
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,260
We'll go in here first.

1593
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,380
It's a threat.

1594
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,520
Honk if you're haunted.

1595
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,040
Honk if you love Minto.

1596
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:04,520
Maybe I should make some bumper stickers.

1597
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,120
Honk if you love Minto.

1598
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,820
Honk honk.

1599
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:20,020
Honk if you love Minto or if you breathe air.

1600
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,810
Honk honk.

1601
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:34,360
I do not do the second one.

1602
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,220
The man is standing in a doorway, watching you approach.

1603
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,360
He's holding an old book in one hand.

1604
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:43,740
It's bound in crimson with silver ribbons.

1605
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,500
Suddenly gravity falls up in the air.

1606
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,840
You came.

1607
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:48,640
Good.

1608
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,680
Allow me to introduce myself.

1609
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,160
I am a collector of many things.

1610
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,560
Art and artifacts.

1611
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,820
Treasures and truths.

1612
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:01,620
And curi-curios that occupy the periphery of desire.

1613
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,940
And you have something for me.

1614
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:10,560
You give the handkerchief to the collector.

1615
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,440
He holds it up to the flickering light and studies it.

1616
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:23,340
These patterns are unmistakable, even after all this time.

1617
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:31,000
This handkerchief comes from an old ship I've been searching for.

1618
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It sank many years ago.

1619
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:37,700
Every second spent breathing air is a second spent not honking because you love Minto.

1620
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,840
Reject breathing!

1621
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:39,420
No!

1622
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:44,420
You can breathe and honk at the same time.

1623
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,020
Just like that.

1624
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:08,940
Honk!

1625
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,140
Okay, I give up.

1626
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,660
You proved it.

1627
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:24,200
Does breathing strip me away from becoming a ghost?

1628
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:24,640
No!

1629
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,500
I mean, well technically, but like, you know.

1630
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,580
Don't become a ghost!

1631
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,020
Don't become a ghost.

1632
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,060
That means that you have unfinished business.

1633
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,600
That's so sad.

1634
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:39,960
Wait, hold on, sorry.

1635
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,900
I don't know why YouTube chat is being a little stinky today.

1636
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:52,030
I carried items of great importance.

1637
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,690
As you can imagine, retrieving them is proving to be challenging.

1638
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,170
That's where you come in.

1639
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:58,610
She called us stinky.

1640
01:25:58,770 --> 01:25:59,430
Not you!

1641
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:01,710
YouTube.

1642
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:05,270
It's YouTube, as always.

1643
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:07,370
My proposition is this.

1644
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:12,230
I will outfit your vessel with equipment that will let you dredge the wrecks and dark depths.

1645
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:17,730
Find me these lost relics and I will reward you in ways beyond all imagining.

1646
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:22,010
You need not give up your fishing career.

1647
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:28,370
I'll merely need a few hours with your vessel to make the necessary alterations.

1648
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:29,390
I accept.

1649
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,220
An excellent decision.

1650
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,660
I'll prepare the equipment immediately.

1651
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,760
Just tinkering with my boat.

1652
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,840
The relics we're looking for are a ring, a necklace, a watch, a music box, and a key.

1653
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,820
Wait, so I don't find these in the fish?

1654
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,320
Passes out from honk.

1655
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,620
No, don't honk!

1656
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:53,880
Breathe!

1657
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,280
Maybe it was an advanced technique.

1658
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:02,180
I'm so sorry for...

1659
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,180
Very advanced technique to you guys.

1660
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:11,060
I would encourage you to ask around the towns about shipwrecks or other strange occurrences.

1661
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,180
Anything that might be worth investigating.

1662
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:15,980
Return when you have something.

1663
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,200
And what's in the workshop?

1664
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,140
It's locked.

1665
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:24,820
Mysterious.

1666
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:26,120
Mysterious, mysterious.

1667
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,840
Alright, let's go dredge.

1668
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,560
We're dredging, we're dredging, we're dredging.

1669
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:40,600
Nevermind.

1670
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,040
I thought this was the deep water.

1671
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,260
Pay money to get in the... Oh, the workshop is DLC?

1672
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,220
I see, I see, I see.

1673
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,420
I see, I see, I see.

1674
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,360
What are we helling out?

1675
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:01,300
My business is to support my ocean color queue and that work is never done.

1676
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:02,060
Stop!

1677
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,100
Stop!

1678
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,920
Let's dredge.

1679
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:17,910
Wait, press F to change length.

1680
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:19,170
Avoid gaps!

1681
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:21,510
Okay, I have to read...

1682
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,590
Okay, I got it.

1683
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:28,690
Okay.

1684
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,510
Good wisps listen.

1685
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,570
We're traversing.

1686
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:49,050
Okay, I'm dredging.

1687
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,740
Nice, I got some wood.

1688
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,660
Ah, we can use that for upgrade stuff.

1689
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:00,800
For real?

1690
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,040
Wait, these look cute.

1691
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:03,920
What are they?

1692
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,000
I don't have a shallow.

1693
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,120
Dang it.

1694
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:09,900
No!

1695
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,660
I'm gonna sleep at this dock.

1696
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,220
I'm not loyal to one city.

1697
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,280
She ends the stream.

1698
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:20,700
No!

1699
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:21,740
Grieving father?

1700
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:24,120
I'm sorry.

1701
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,180
Hello, is everything okay?

1702
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,100
Do you know of any shipwrecks around here?

1703
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,720
He's like physically crying.

1704
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:35,660
Hello, sir.

1705
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,680
Bad wisps live on in legends.

1706
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,880
What is that saying?

1707
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,100
Oh...

1708
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,660
Women who follow rules don't make history.

1709
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,720
That does not apply to you guys.

1710
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,020
Do you want us to listen or to tell you the truth?

1711
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:55,780
Tell me the truth.

1712
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,900
I can take it.

1713
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,420
Well, yes.

1714
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,120
You see, my only son was lost at sea some years ago.

1715
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,720
He's still out there somewhere.

1716
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,800
In one of those wrecks.

1717
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,020
All alone in the cold, dark water.

1718
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,620
What if he's alive and married to a mermaid?

1719
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:19,860
Minto cute.

1720
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:20,620
That's the truth.

1721
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:23,380
You lie!

1722
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,920
Papa, you lie!

1723
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,840
Papa, you lie!

1724
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:36,080
The man is clearly trying his hardest to remain composed, but tremors of grief wrack his body.

1725
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,360
Truth is Minto cute.

1726
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:39,920
You lie!

1727
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,620
I was wondering.

1728
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,520
I noticed you have some dredging equipment installed on your vessel.

1729
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:54,660
If we were able to retrieve any of his belongings from the wreck, I'd think he'd feel more at peace if his mementos were with me.

1730
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:59,020
He wore a bronze belt buckle, specially engraved.

1731
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,560
I'd recognize it anywhere.

1732
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,920
If there's a chance you could find it, I'd be in your debt.

1733
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,480
Minto is cute.

1734
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:06,760
Stop!

1735
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,880
Any strange occurrences?

1736
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,700
I don't get out a lot anymore.

1737
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,600
So I don't see much of what goes on.

1738
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,780
But I do remember the old mayor in his final days.

1739
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,380
What an awful sight it was.

1740
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,520
Screaming and throwing things into the sea.

1741
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,680
Throw it back!

1742
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,460
He would cry over and over.

1743
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,200
Begging anyone who would listen.

1744
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,720
Howling it to the wind.

1745
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,060
These days I almost feel like I understand.

1746
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:30,920
Anything else?

1747
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:31,880
Nah.

1748
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:35,560
Alright, what are you guys saying?

1749
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,320
What are you guys saying?

1750
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,320
Especially when she's...

1751
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,300
I'm not!

1752
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,240
Let's sleep here.

1753
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:52,510
Throw it back.

1754
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,950
We're throwing it back, baby.

1755
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:58,710
Okay, so we got a ring.

1756
01:31:58,830 --> 01:31:59,690
I wanna dredge.

1757
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,430
I wanna dredge a lot of stuff.

1758
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:02,570
I wanna...

1759
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:03,890
I wanna...

1760
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:05,070
In the deep sea.

1761
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:06,270
I wanna fish.

1762
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,930
We're gonna do lots of stuff.

1763
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,230
We're like...

1764
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,750
We've unlocked the whole game basically at this point.

1765
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,810
That was so close.

1766
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,270
I forgot to sell my whale.

1767
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:28,050
Let's go sell him.

1768
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:32,370
One of the cutest.

1769
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,590
Stop it, please!

1770
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:43,020
That's also material.

1771
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,520
Jesus.

1772
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,110
There is no one here.

1773
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:52,910
Dang it.

1774
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:57,050
We'll never stop.

1775
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,230
My crabs!

1776
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:02,970
My crabs are ready!

1777
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:05,710
Look, they're bustling.

1778
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:16,110
I have a common crab.

1779
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:21,350
I'll leave the pot there for some more time.

1780
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,570
I am a common wisp.

1781
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:35,830
Yeah, I got some crabs.

1782
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:37,930
One...

1783
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:40,090
That's the fiddler crab!

1784
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,770
Holy moly.

1785
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:45,270
Regular business.

1786
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,190
Wait, this guy only sells for...

1787
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:49,170
Oh, he's rotting!

1788
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,450
You guys, I messed up.

1789
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:55,210
I messed up!

1790
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:57,070
No!

1791
01:33:57,810 --> 01:33:58,490
Oh my gosh.

1792
01:33:58,490 --> 01:34:00,310
We're such a hot commodity.

1793
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,650
I waited too long.

1794
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:03,750
I didn't realize.

1795
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:09,310
I didn't realize.

1796
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:13,870
Correct engine operation.

1797
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:16,150
That's right, I have books.

1798
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:20,170
Let's put these...

1799
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:24,930
I'm gonna put these in storage for now.

1800
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:27,450
I'm getting overwhelmed.

1801
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,090
Oh, I can store stuff here.

1802
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:33,670
Maybe we do...

1803
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:38,530
More rod space.

1804
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:40,190
Is what we'll work on, maybe.

1805
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:40,730
I don't know.

1806
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:44,770
I'm not forgetting Tab.

1807
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:46,590
But I did forget Tab, yeah.

1808
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:47,090
I did.

1809
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:48,490
Let's see.

1810
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:50,790
What is this one about?

1811
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:53,470
Correct engine operation.

1812
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,390
Rods, reels, and ropes.

1813
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:57,610
Eh, we'll just read that one.

1814
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:00,130
I'm gonna come back to these guys.

1815
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:02,570
I wanna go fishing first.

1816
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:04,570
And dredging.

1817
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,430
Always have a book selected.

1818
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:08,870
Yeah, I forgot about it.

1819
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:09,490
That's my bad.

1820
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:11,310
That's my bad.

1821
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:15,630
So there is two places I want to go to.

1822
01:35:17,010 --> 01:35:19,650
One is here, because this is a deep ocean.

1823
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:22,630
This is an oceanic, I remember.

1824
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,410
I couldn't fish here before.

1825
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:29,050
I got an...

1826
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:32,150
Okay, we're gonna see this reel amount.

1827
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:33,950
Wait, there's more?

1828
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:37,090
There we go.

1829
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:37,630
Nice, nice.

1830
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:38,190
Start fishing.

1831
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:42,270
We got another, boys.

1832
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:46,500
Nice.

1833
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,000
I don't think I can fit another...

1834
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,360
Can I?

1835
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,340
Fish Tetris.

1836
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,910
Maybe.

1837
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:11,810
We're too good.

1838
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:14,230
We're too good!

1839
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:16,250
Alright.

1840
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:21,130
Then, I remember there was a ship on the other side of that island that I wanna go dredge.

1841
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,070
Back it up, back it up.

1842
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:28,210
Back it up.

1843
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,370
Back it up.

1844
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:33,970
Oh, I don't have the dessert water.

1845
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,970
Why does it sound so ominous?

1846
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:41,350
She said the title.

1847
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:46,150
She's saying the title.

1848
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:48,090
So far, I'm so relaxed.

1849
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:50,350
I feel like I could play this game for like 10 hours.

1850
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:52,450
You know what I mean?

1851
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,250
I feel like I played...

1852
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:57,030
$100 each!

1853
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:57,810
Almost!

1854
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:00,900
Well, this guy is a little...

1855
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,990
You know, he's smaller but he's a bit of a runt.

1856
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:07,870
Do it.

1857
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:11,770
We're rich!

1858
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:14,010
We're so rich!

1859
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:16,710
Let's do the builder.

1860
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,270
It's peaceful.

1861
01:37:27,810 --> 01:37:29,210
This game reminds me of a game called...

1862
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,910
I don't know why I can't hear donuts.

1863
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:33,810
I just realized.

1864
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:38,470
Like the sound isn't playing.

1865
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,240
I don't hear it either.

1866
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,060
Thank you so much for the 50 yen!

1867
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:57,860
Thank you!

1868
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,360
Thank you so much.

1869
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,320
This one of mine earlier...

1870
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:02,240
I'm so sorry!

1871
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:03,720
Oh, I see it.

1872
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,180
Are you a wisp monger?

1873
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,460
Oh wait, no, I've read that one.

1874
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,860
Oh wait, this one.

1875
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,800
Step one, sleep during the day.

1876
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:11,780
Step two, fish at night.

1877
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,460
Step three, question mark, question mark, question mark.

1878
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,440
Step four, profit!

1879
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,580
This game reminds me of a game called Nantucket.

1880
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:22,120
It's a whaling roguelike and is loosely based on Moby Dick.

1881
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:24,020
Fun.

1882
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,720
It's got to be damn sight better than this bloody town.

1883
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:32,960
I think I just need to get away for a while.

1884
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,060
Maybe not come back.

1885
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,340
Going backwards is a mistake, don't you think?

1886
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,380
You should always keep moving forward.

1887
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:39,160
Moving along.

1888
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,600
I can't go back.

1889
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,800
What if we like roleplay our snake?

1890
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,100
She's gazing out to the sea again.

1891
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:50,200
Lost in thought.

1892
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:53,600
Say, if you find some materials, maybe you can help me move.

1893
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:54,780
I mean really move.

1894
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,240
There's an island I've heard of.

1895
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,480
Steel Point to the north.

1896
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:01,600
Two units of lumber and two units of scrap is all I need.

1897
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:03,680
I can make a new place for myself out there.

1898
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,080
You'd be welcome to visit too.

1899
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:09,220
Just stack it up at Steel Point when you have anything.

1900
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:10,920
I'll pay you when the job's done.

1901
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,620
Snake the fisherman.

1902
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,140
Jay, thank you so much for the five gifted.

1903
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:19,160
Thank you.

1904
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,820
What do you think is the best bait to catch a maid?

1905
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:24,820
Specifically of the phantom kind.

1906
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,280
Hopefully mint colored.

1907
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:32,060
You think I would fall so easily for just a measly bait?

1908
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:37,840
If I were to be caught... Oh, I don't know if you're talking about me.

1909
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:44,920
But if you were to try and catch a ghost of the phantom variety that is mint colored...

1910
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:53,860
I would suggest... I would suggest anything with a flashy light lure.

1911
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:56,480
You know?

1912
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,500
Did the stream go down?

1913
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,600
Stream dead?

1914
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:15,610
It's fine here.

1915
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:17,770
Maybe refresh.

1916
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:19,670
Refresh, refresh.

1917
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:23,590
Let's see what the lighthouse keeper has to say.

1918
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:25,130
What is it?

1919
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:29,090
Do you know of any shipwrecks around here?

1920
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:30,850
She eyes you suspiciously.

1921
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:36,410
There's a spot near the back of Greater Miro where the current carries in wreckage from the sea.

1922
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:41,790
Some nights you can see a natural glow rising from the patch of dark water.

1923
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:44,990
I can't imagine what's down there in the deep.

1924
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:49,590
So if you're looking for what I think you're looking for, it's best to just move on.

1925
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:58,000
Stream fine for you.

1926
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:04,260
Yeah, it might be regional issues, but it seems like so many people are saying that it's an issue.

1927
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:06,840
I think it's an NA thing.

1928
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:11,220
It's not on my end.

1929
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,020
For sure.

1930
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:13,080
For sure.

1931
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,630
It's not on my end for sure.

1932
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:23,050
Santiago, thank you so much for the five gift, thank you!

1933
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:27,190
South US and lacked.

1934
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:28,590
JP fine.

1935
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:30,890
Thank you.

1936
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:38,880
Sorry guys.

1937
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,460
Maybe try and remember where you saw... where you last left.

1938
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,920
You can come back during the VOD or something.

1939
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,720
Have you heard of any strange things happening?

1940
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,260
I see plenty of strange things from atop the lighthouse.

1941
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,920
Sometimes I don't know whether I can trust my own eyes.

1942
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:01,280
She holds the lantern up so that it shines brightly into your face.

1943
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,700
Are you really standing here in front of me?

1944
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,100
Or is it just another of the fox tricks?

1945
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,380
Hot dog donut test.

1946
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,160
Hot dog working.

1947
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:12,260
Hot dog working.

1948
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,900
Charm Quark, welcome to membership.

1949
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:15,620
Thank you!

1950
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:18,480
YouTube please, all I did was tell the truth.

1951
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,760
The truth cannot be handled.

1952
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,680
Who lives on Blackstone Isle?

1953
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,660
I see a lot from up here, you know.

1954
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,940
I saw that ill-fated boat return.

1955
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,660
I chose to look the other way.

1956
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:38,240
I watched in a natural glow flicker through those windows.

1957
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:41,700
Whatever you've got planned, I hope you know what you're doing out there.

1958
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:44,340
I don't know actually.

1959
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:49,800
What do you know about the old mayor of Little Morrow?

1960
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:54,380
That's... he's... I try not to think about him.

1961
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,380
It's a painful memory for us all.

1962
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:01,900
Some nights I still think I can hear the hum of his engine sailing past the bay.

1963
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:06,160
But I know he's gone and I don't want to talk about it anymore.

1964
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,940
Okay, I should go.

1965
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:11,220
I should get out of here.

1966
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,560
We have so many... so many... okay.

1967
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,240
We need a fiddler crab.

1968
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,300
We need a belt buckle.

1969
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:29,100
We need the relics.

1970
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:31,220
Neagle!

1971
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:32,280
Welcome to membership.

1972
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:32,880
Thank you.

1973
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:33,700
We back?

1974
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:34,700
Yippee!

1975
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:37,280
Install some headlights for night fishing.

1976
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,260
We should do that.

1977
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:46,540
They're kind of expensive and they're not very good.

1978
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:47,860
Let's see.

1979
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,520
What's our current... oh we have like no light.

1980
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:53,920
These are the same.

1981
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,280
We'll get the $180 one.

1982
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:01,580
Alright.

1983
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:01,660
Alright.

1984
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,580
Wait, so if I right click...

1985
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:17,020
I see, I see.

1986
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:18,580
So it does...

1987
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:20,660
It does.

1988
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:22,580
It does.

1989
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:23,680
It does its thing.

1990
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:27,580
Is this still catching fish or...

1991
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:30,720
Or checkpot?

1992
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:32,220
Needs repair!

1993
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:32,720
Oh.

1994
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:35,660
I guess we'll grab you.

1995
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,880
Let's do a little bit of fishing before we go in.

1996
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,400
I don't have the right equipment.

1997
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:45,640
Okay.

1998
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,380
No worries.

1999
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,420
Now that I have a light I feel so less scared.

2000
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,140
I don't know if that's a good thing or not.

2001
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,820
I don't have the shallow.

2002
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,120
Okay, just kidding.

2003
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:04,010
Go into the dark sea.

2004
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:06,530
Will I die?

2005
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,590
Wait, what's that glowing over there?

2006
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:09,090
You see that?

2007
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:14,090
See that glowing out yonder?

2008
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:20,800
What is that?

2009
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:23,120
Go check it out.

2010
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,760
I hope I don't die.

2011
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:25,800
Okay.

2012
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:29,720
Oh, that's a rock.

2013
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:35,600
Wait, wait, wait!

2014
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:45,710
What's happening?

2015
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:47,690
Oh, hear a foghorn echo.

2016
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:49,790
I think I'm about to get attacked.

2017
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:53,430
I think I messed up!

2018
01:45:53,690 --> 01:45:54,950
No sir, it was a friendly...

2019
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:56,050
It was a friendly gesture.

2020
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,010
It was a greeting.

2021
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:57,090
Greetings!

2022
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:57,610
Hello!

2023
01:45:58,390 --> 01:46:00,570
I think I'm in trouble.

2024
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:01,330
I think I'm in trouble.

2025
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:02,090
I think I'm in trouble.

2026
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:03,370
I think I'm in trouble.

2027
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:07,810
Oh gosh, there's rocks.

2028
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:09,110
Oh gosh, there's rocks.

2029
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:23,980
Oh he's still out there.

2030
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:24,720
Wait, is that him?

2031
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:27,560
Dang it.

2032
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,320
Who told me to honk?

2033
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,340
Who told me to honk?

2034
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,000
Who told me to honk?

2035
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:53,530
But I wanted to see what the shiny was.

2036
01:46:57,630 --> 01:47:00,310
I wanted to see what the shiny was.

2037
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:01,890
So sad.

2038
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,320
Man...

2039
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,700
I haven't died yet.

2040
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,340
I guess you...

2041
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:12,720
Oh well.

2042
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:16,580
Seems very much like you will be able to die in this game.

2043
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:17,820
So...

2044
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:20,820
Alright, let's put our crab pot...

2045
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:22,320
What if we...

2046
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,040
Put it like more in the ocean.

2047
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,160
Plenty of crab, plenty of crab.

2048
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,240
I don't know if the bigger crab needs like a...

2049
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,520
Like more depth, you know?

2050
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:34,760
Maybe like 9 meters?

2051
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:38,520
Right here.

2052
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:41,400
Alrighty.

2053
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,080
I'm never equipping my horn ever again.

2054
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:52,900
Honk honk.

2055
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,360
Wait.

2056
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:58,480
Is this deep water or coastal water?

2057
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,080
I can't tell.

2058
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:03,940
Coastal.

2059
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,620
Why do you hate honk?

2060
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,640
Honk to us.

2061
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,420
Stop it right now.

2062
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,500
What did we learn there?

2063
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,280
Honk is bigger than our oshi.

2064
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:22,640
No!

2065
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:28,470
Not even.

2066
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:30,750
A little?

2067
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:35,530
Alright, I know there's a shipwreck over here.

2068
01:48:38,690 --> 01:48:40,210
We're gonna go check it out.

2069
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:54,530
Right there!

2070
01:48:56,050 --> 01:48:57,830
Look look look look look, it's even shiny.

2071
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:02,450
What if this is the guy's son?

2072
01:49:02,690 --> 01:49:04,070
He was like right next door.

2073
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,370
Go for a sail around the edge of the whole island.

2074
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:08,950
Neat stuff can be found in nooks and crannies.

2075
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:10,530
That's what I'm trying to do.

2076
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:12,070
We'll go to the other side.

2077
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:12,910
Okay, dredge.

2078
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:15,750
Star dredge.

2079
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:17,070
Oh, shoot!

2080
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:17,570
Ah, shoot!

2081
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:19,050
Ah, shoot!

2082
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:21,070
Oh my god.

2083
01:49:21,670 --> 01:49:22,550
Oh my gosh.

2084
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:22,590
Oh my gosh.

2085
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:32,470
Oh my god, the guy's son really did just die on the other side of the island.

2086
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,160
Wait, I was kidding!

2087
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,220
No way!

2088
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:42,280
He was right here!

2089
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,100
No way!

2090
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,940
He was right here!

2091
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,760
A little tragic maybe.

2092
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,280
Why is that funny?

2093
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,620
I'm a nervous laugher.

2094
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:00,960
Okay.

2095
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:03,800
I laugh at everything.

2096
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:04,680
Please understand.

2097
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:12,360
Please.

2098
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,000
There we go.

2099
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,680
Oh, this is still coastal?

2100
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:15,880
Ah, whatever.

2101
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,060
Part of me doesn't want to press F.

2102
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:23,260
You know, I want to press like...

2103
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:26,580
I want to press like space instead.

2104
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:30,140
Uh oh.

2105
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:40,550
What should I do?

2106
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:46,920
You can change the settings.

2107
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:48,200
True.

2108
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,740
We got a shark!

2109
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,000
Okay, good.

2110
01:50:58,780 --> 01:50:59,760
We almost there.

2111
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,780
We weren't able to fit our shark.

2112
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:06,540
Let's see if we can get another one.

2113
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:08,660
If I'm good!

2114
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:09,260
Oh my god.

2115
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:11,220
There we go.

2116
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:13,080
Alright.

2117
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,220
I'm going home, I'm going home, I'm going home.

2118
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:19,840
What is that?

2119
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,000
Oh wait, that's my crab.

2120
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:24,220
Which I will check another day.

2121
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:35,510
Once we upgrade a little bit more, we'll go over to that, you know.

2122
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:40,070
We just got an axe.

2123
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:47,770
Let's see if we have...

2124
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:48,730
Okay, nice!

2125
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:50,090
We can read our other book.

2126
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:53,330
No crab cakes tonight.

2127
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:55,270
Book finished.

2128
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:56,290
Yeah, got it.

2129
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:56,690
Thank you.

2130
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:01,070
And our map is all that.

2131
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:02,510
Encyclopedia...

2132
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:04,910
Pursuits.

2133
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:06,730
We got to return the belt buckle.

2134
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:10,370
And we... I need to find scrap.

2135
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:16,210
Okay.

2136
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:19,870
These are 122 each.

2137
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:20,370
Let's go.

2138
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:23,610
Heck yeah!

2139
01:52:27,590 --> 01:52:28,550
Net time?

2140
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:29,530
Right now?

2141
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:31,130
Should I go check it?

2142
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:35,130
I might get hit by rocks, but I guess it might be okay.

2143
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:38,990
It's not even midnight.

2144
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,650
What should I...

2145
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:46,110
I guess we could... Oh no.

2146
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:50,630
I don't really have much else that I can buy.

2147
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,290
That I don't already have.

2148
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:58,750
And then with this...

2149
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:00,890
I don't have anything.

2150
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:03,410
Upgrade the rod.

2151
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:04,190
Rod.

2152
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:07,210
Oh yeah, I got... Oh!

2153
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:08,230
Like this!

2154
01:53:09,690 --> 01:53:12,270
How do I get research parts though?

2155
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:15,290
Use parts to research new equipment.

2156
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:18,630
Click on things in the dry menu.

2157
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:19,950
Dry drop menu.

2158
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:22,410
So if I'm like this...

2159
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:34,590
I can't purchase it.

2160
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:37,550
I get them from dredging.

2161
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:38,410
Yeah, I know that.

2162
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:39,150
Oh!

2163
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:40,450
Wait, the research...

2164
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:42,470
The research parts too I get from dredging?

2165
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:43,830
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2166
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:46,530
No, no, I'm not...

2167
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:47,290
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2168
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:48,890
These...

2169
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:51,390
Those things... These I'm using for the quest.

2170
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:54,550
I don't want to use it for...

2171
01:53:55,950 --> 01:53:59,250
I don't want to use it for the upgrades just yet.

2172
01:54:00,450 --> 01:54:02,230
Binto is my favorite fisherman.

2173
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:03,750
Thanks, Mio.

2174
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:08,810
Let's check on our crab.

2175
01:54:11,370 --> 01:54:12,970
Like here... Is this dredging?

2176
01:54:14,110 --> 01:54:14,370
No.

2177
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:24,680
Don't do that!

2178
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:25,360
Please.

2179
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:29,440
It doesn't seem that we have any crabs.

2180
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:32,480
I'm heading home.

2181
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:34,240
I'm scared.

2182
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:39,750
No rocks, please.

2183
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:42,730
No rocks, please.

2184
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:45,010
Honk?

2185
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:45,850
I already did that.

2186
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:49,190
I already did that.

2187
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:54,290
Okay.

2188
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:59,350
You ever think how mint sounds like?

2189
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:02,370
What are you gonna say, Ophelia?

2190
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:04,010
Little Tommy Pickles.

2191
01:55:04,410 --> 01:55:05,310
It's one of my favorite games.

2192
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:07,410
And seeing one of my favorite streamers play is a double treat.

2193
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:08,250
Thanks, Everkin!

2194
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:10,770
Alright.

2195
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:11,790
Did I get it?

2196
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:12,890
I sold everything.

2197
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:13,610
We're going to sleep.

2198
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:18,050
Honk shoo, honk shoo, honk shoo, honk shoo.

2199
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:20,390
Honk shoo, honk shoo, honk shoo, honk shoo.

2200
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:26,850
Okay, let's go check our crabs.

2201
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:29,850
And we'll explore around...

2202
01:55:31,690 --> 01:55:33,390
Why is this fancy?

2203
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:35,730
What is this?

2204
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:38,010
Wait, wait, wait.

2205
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:41,270
How do I... It's fancy, it's fancy.

2206
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:42,590
What do I do?

2207
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,670
I need my shallow rod.

2208
01:55:53,710 --> 01:55:54,810
Thank yous out.

2209
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,960
Kinda sound like the guy who plays Steve.

2210
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:03,300
In the Minecraft movie.

2211
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:04,800
Jack Black.

2212
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:07,740
Oh, what does he say?

2213
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:08,660
Flint and steel.

2214
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:18,180
How do I... Wait.

2215
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,840
To cargo.

2216
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:22,060
Okay, so wait.

2217
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:24,240
I need to store this first.

2218
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:27,020
I wish I could get rid of this.

2219
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:28,920
Uninstall.

2220
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,080
Store.

2221
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:33,540
Take.

2222
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,860
I just realized it takes time.

2223
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:43,840
Oh no, will it be gone?

2224
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:46,280
My shiny, please.

2225
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:51,940
Oh, it's still there, it's still there.

2226
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,380
Oh, and we have crabs.

2227
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:55,980
We got crabs!

2228
01:56:57,580 --> 01:56:57,780
Okay.

2229
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,200
Oops, my bad.

2230
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:05,980
A barbed eel.

2231
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:13,000
So the shiny is...

2232
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:17,020
A special guy.

2233
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:21,460
Still a common crab.

2234
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:23,020
Lame.

2235
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,200
Alright, let's check around the island a little bit.

2236
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,720
Need to see a doctor about that.

2237
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:38,120
Really?

2238
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,240
Is it that dangerous?

2239
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,320
Curved?

2240
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,060
We got to get the curved fish?

2241
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:13,370
The music is so ominous.

2242
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:20,230
What's over here?

2243
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:23,090
Shiny.

2244
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:27,370
All that's left of this boat is an old husk.

2245
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:29,170
You pull a little closer.

2246
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:31,510
We got a ring!

2247
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:33,630
We've got research board!

2248
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:36,530
We've got old iron chain!

2249
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,010
Nice.

2250
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:44,890
Okay.

2251
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:47,790
Good stuff, good stuff.

2252
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:51,810
For a Lovecraft inspired game, it's really relaxing.

2253
01:58:51,930 --> 01:58:52,310
Alright!

2254
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:55,290
Thank you for the superchat.

2255
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:56,350
Thank you so much!

2256
01:58:57,010 --> 01:58:57,410
Wood?

2257
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:58,850
Oh, there was wood?

2258
01:58:59,130 --> 01:58:59,810
Okay, I'll go back.

2259
01:58:59,850 --> 01:59:00,810
Sorry, I didn't notice it.

2260
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:07,510
The stone hums quietly, sending ripples through the air around it.

2261
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:12,290
Faint shapes dance upon its surface, vanishing before your eyes...

2262
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:14,310
Before your eyes can focus on them.

2263
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:17,830
The cold stone does not respond to my touch.

2264
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:20,950
I've got to...oh, sorry.

2265
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:22,630
I've got a cold touch.

2266
01:59:24,350 --> 01:59:26,350
I'm a little worried about the time.

2267
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:30,650
I'm a little scared.

2268
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:34,150
Oh, I see the wood.

2269
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:35,590
I can't believe I was so blind.

2270
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:45,020
I need to go insane first.

2271
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:45,860
Really?

2272
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,040
I'm not already?

2273
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:53,200
I'm scared.

2274
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:55,480
I'm scared of being out at night.

2275
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:58,760
It's right there.

2276
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:07,040
Will I die?

2277
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:08,520
Will I die?

2278
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:10,000
Will I die?

2279
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,860
I'm dredging for a keyblade?

2280
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:19,160
Oh shit!

2281
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,540
I'm not very good at this, huh?

2282
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:29,760
This thing is huge!

2283
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:41,000
An abnormally large and heavy key cast from an unfamiliar metal.

2284
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,160
I need to leave.

2285
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:45,380
I need to go.

2286
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:46,540
I think it's time for me to go.

2287
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:57,050
Don't honk back.

2288
02:00:57,590 --> 02:00:58,370
Don't honk back.

2289
02:00:58,830 --> 02:00:59,770
Don't honk back.

2290
02:01:00,230 --> 02:01:01,210
Don't honk back.

2291
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:03,130
I'm gonna go over here and sleep.

2292
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:07,090
I'm gonna go to this part and sleep.

2293
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:15,260
Keep going!

2294
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:15,660
Keep going!

2295
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:16,040
Keep going!

2296
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,320
My ship!

2297
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:22,820
What is that?

2298
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:30,840
Wait, did I lose anything when I got damaged?

2299
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:31,720
I didn't check.

2300
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:33,860
No!

2301
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,880
We lost our special fish!

2302
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,220
Aw man.

2303
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:41,900
Aw man.

2304
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:42,960
That sucks.

2305
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:47,820
I lost the research part too!

2306
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:52,600
That sucks.

2307
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,000
That sucks.

2308
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:02,780
My eel.

2309
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:04,540
My special eel.

2310
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,120
But I can take the key to him.

2311
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,040
Show me.

2312
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,720
You hand him the key.

2313
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:17,920
The cold metal shimmers a strange shine as he holds it.

2314
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,800
The shape of the key, the teeth, the head.

2315
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:22,840
Now somehow it seems changed.

2316
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:23,520
Smaller.

2317
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:24,740
Has it always been this way?

2318
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,800
Is this all?

2319
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:27,540
Where's the lock?

2320
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:28,620
I'm working on it!

2321
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:30,340
The collector grows agitated.

2322
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:34,960
It seems the pieces we're looking for have traveled further than I anticipated.

2323
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:36,700
Much further, I suspect.

2324
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:42,860
It sucks in the early game.

2325
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:43,860
Aw yeah yeah.

2326
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:46,520
In that case, allow me to aid in your travels.

2327
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:49,700
He turns a few pages in the book and mutters something low under his breath.

2328
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,880
A burst of light fills your vision and you stagger back briefly.

2329
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:58,580
Otherworldly speed at a price.

2330
02:02:58,940 --> 02:03:00,660
Now go, we have more relics to uncover.

2331
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:02,380
Am I the bad guy?

2332
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:09,780
My intuition tells me that the current may have carried some debris to the southeast, towards Gale Cliffs.

2333
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:11,200
Make that your priority.

2334
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:14,640
I'll mark a location on your map where you can begin your search.

2335
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:15,880
Anything else?

2336
02:03:19,820 --> 02:03:22,420
The words you read from that book, what did they do to me?

2337
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:24,740
The book holds power from the deep.

2338
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,100
I merely extended its power toward you.

2339
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:30,160
Is there one in particular you wish to know more about?

2340
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,300
The bad guy?

2341
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:35,700
No, we're not the bad guy.

2342
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:36,800
There's no way.

2343
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:44,320
I'm innocent through my innocence.

2344
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:46,640
Obviously.

2345
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:51,120
Arriving to Minto Streams with otherworldly speed.

2346
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,860
The words of haste are instant and cruel.

2347
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,780
They will impart a terrible speed to your vessel.

2348
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:03,040
Be warned, however, it may put a great deal of stress on your engines.

2349
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,360
I'll ask him later.

2350
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:12,380
We'll talk later.

2351
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,360
There is the thing right here.

2352
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,780
Should I even try to get it?

2353
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,300
What if I put my stuff in storage?

2354
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:24,100
Someone said put all your things in storage.

2355
02:04:28,830 --> 02:04:31,790
If I do that, will I not lose them?

2356
02:04:36,910 --> 02:04:38,590
Go store your stuff and go get the thing?

2357
02:04:38,770 --> 02:04:40,550
Okay, let's go get it.

2358
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:40,990
Hold on.

2359
02:04:41,410 --> 02:04:43,670
Why is YouTube so bad?

2360
02:04:43,730 --> 02:04:44,870
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2361
02:04:45,550 --> 02:04:48,190
I feel like I'm always complaining about the chat freezing.

2362
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:56,060
I feel like I'm always like, I care, everything freezes on my end.

2363
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:58,960
Luckily I can still read through OBS, but it's frustrating.

2364
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:03,800
I wonder if maybe I should start using a different browser.

2365
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:11,490
Put us in the microwave.

2366
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:16,710
Yes, I'm gonna fix YouTube.

2367
02:05:17,150 --> 02:05:17,730
It's me.

2368
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:19,190
It's me.

2369
02:05:19,670 --> 02:05:25,630
I use Firefox right now, but the chat is always freezing all the time.

2370
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:27,410
Alright, let's go.

2371
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:33,050
It's like right here.

2372
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:37,890
Or is it right there?

2373
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:39,350
Yes.

2374
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:40,850
What if I die?

2375
02:05:42,190 --> 02:05:43,790
Wait, it seems kind of far away.

2376
02:05:46,730 --> 02:05:47,690
Where is it?

2377
02:05:49,490 --> 02:05:50,490
Is this real?

2378
02:05:50,950 --> 02:05:52,610
I think I got duped.

2379
02:05:52,850 --> 02:05:54,250
I think I'm crazy.

2380
02:05:54,970 --> 02:05:56,090
I think I got...

2381
02:05:57,310 --> 02:06:00,450
I think I got bamboozled.

2382
02:06:12,970 --> 02:06:13,410
Oopsie!

2383
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:14,710
Oh my gosh, it's already 4 AM.

2384
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:16,830
Time for our 2 hour rest.

2385
02:06:19,630 --> 02:06:21,370
The red fog makes you go crazy.

2386
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:22,910
Oh, I thought it was an item.

2387
02:06:27,550 --> 02:06:27,990
Ouch!

2388
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:37,420
What's one more... What's one more thing that we gotta...

2389
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:41,220
That we gotta fix, huh?

2390
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:46,110
Whoa, what?

2391
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:46,410
Oh.

2392
02:06:47,870 --> 02:06:49,470
It's like a water spout.

2393
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:55,570
Try out the haste.

2394
02:06:56,090 --> 02:06:56,670
Should I?

2395
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,000
I don't even feel like I'm going that fast.

2396
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,780
Uh oh, my ship is on fire.

2397
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:15,320
About the belt buckle.

2398
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:22,180
You explain that you found a belt buckle, but it's currently in your sto...

2399
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:24,840
Oh, sorry, it's in my storage.

2400
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:29,670
My storage.

2401
02:07:33,070 --> 02:07:33,430
Well...

2402
02:07:34,270 --> 02:07:34,630
Yeah.

2403
02:07:35,730 --> 02:07:38,190
Well, it only hurts something wide...

2404
02:07:38,190 --> 02:07:40,130
I'm getting all messed up.

2405
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:41,450
How do I get to my storage?

2406
02:07:42,870 --> 02:07:43,590
Oh, here it is.

2407
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:49,590
And we can maybe sell...

2408
02:07:52,530 --> 02:07:54,590
We can maybe sell...

2409
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:59,430
Sorry, it looks so...

2410
02:07:59,430 --> 02:08:00,950
I don't know what I'm thinking.

2411
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:02,350
We can sell these.

2412
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:06,690
And maybe this?

2413
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:14,490
Okay, alright.

2414
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,330
Grieving Father.

2415
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:18,510
About the belt buckle.

2416
02:08:19,370 --> 02:08:21,910
Yes, you give the belt buckle to the man.

2417
02:08:22,550 --> 02:08:24,030
This is... this is his.

2418
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:25,230
Oh, thank you, bless you.

2419
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:26,430
You've returned him to me.

2420
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,870
Please, take this.

2421
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:29,870
I'm not... any money to pay you.

2422
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:32,930
But this might hold value.

2423
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:33,630
Oh, thank you.

2424
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:36,370
Thank you so much.

2425
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:38,870
Okay, and the trader...

2426
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:40,270
Sell all trinkets.

2427
02:08:41,210 --> 02:08:42,290
There we go.

2428
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:42,990
Alright.

2429
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:45,310
Store.

2430
02:08:45,810 --> 02:08:46,830
Yeah, we'll store that.

2431
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:48,870
I've learned my lesson.

2432
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:51,270
And let's go check our...

2433
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:54,330
Crabs.

2434
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:02,300
Alright.

2435
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:03,860
Money, money, money.

2436
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:06,240
Money, money, money.

2437
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:07,960
Oh gosh, seriously?

2438
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:09,860
I

2439
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:18,360
need to put it in a different spot.

2440
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:20,580
I don't need curved fish.

2441
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:24,660
That is exactly what I was just about to search for.

2442
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:27,320
Some curved fish, baby.

2443
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:31,280
Oh wait, we can use this.

2444
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:35,920
There's curved fish!

2445
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:40,680
Oh my

2446
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:57,640
gosh, why am I so silly?

2447
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:00,120
I'm so silly.

2448
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:00,320
Please.

2449
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:08,440
Wow, how many do you think they need in there?

2450
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:12,680
Oh my gosh, we can do even more?

2451
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:17,430
Nice.

2452
02:10:18,290 --> 02:10:20,110
We need lots of curved fish.

2453
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:23,970
We should probably go do that right now.

2454
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,620
We should go do that.

2455
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:30,540
To the shrine!

2456
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:31,320
To the shrine!

2457
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:39,060
Should we be out in the sea on such a bad storm?

2458
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:43,100
Be careful not to crash.

2459
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,120
Hey, hey, don't jinx me.

2460
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,340
The music sounds so scary here.

2461
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:57,080
Curved fish.

2462
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,620
Curved fish.

2463
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:01,840
Curved fish.

2464
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:02,900
Curved fish.

2465
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:04,300
Curved fish.

2466
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:05,440
Oh, is this like a puzzle?

2467
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:16,210
I've figured... I've learned your puzzle.

2468
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:43,120
Can I store this?

2469
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:44,640
I stored it.

2470
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:48,340
What does it do?

2471
02:11:55,860 --> 02:11:57,680
Clashing of bone and sinew?

2472
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:00,020
I was thinking that too.

2473
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,580
Metal gear?

2474
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:02,740
A little bit?

2475
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:04,560
Okay, let's go home.

2476
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:05,360
Don't crash.

2477
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,280
Oh, I say, it's just a buoy.

2478
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:13,900
I didn't make any money, but...

2479
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:17,120
Oh well.

2480
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:20,760
Don't crash.

2481
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:21,500
I can't see!

2482
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,200
Drift!

2483
02:12:26,140 --> 02:12:27,260
Yo, I'm too good.

2484
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:32,920
That reel is worth a lot.

2485
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:35,420
Is it any good?

2486
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,500
Like, should I use it?

2487
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:42,210
I was so close.

2488
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:44,250
Not even a little.

2489
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:46,050
What are you talking about?

2490
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:47,290
I was not even...

2491
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:51,290
I can turn in my sleep.

2492
02:12:54,430 --> 02:12:56,110
It's both shallow and coastal.

2493
02:12:56,610 --> 02:12:57,690
It's huge!

2494
02:13:03,530 --> 02:13:05,810
Oh, it's you.

2495
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:07,490
Who were you expecting?

2496
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:09,590
Your engine, it sounds like...

2497
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:11,810
I'm sorry, I mistook it for the vessel of an old friend.

2498
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:14,710
Dejected, she turns and walks back towards the lighthouse.

2499
02:13:15,610 --> 02:13:17,610
Is it because our engine is busted?

2500
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:23,090
Please repair my ship.

2501
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:24,910
Thank you!

2502
02:13:28,150 --> 02:13:30,830
So this is coastal and shallow.

2503
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:31,010
Shallow.

2504
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:41,820
Please install.

2505
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:46,080
Nice.

2506
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,700
Yeah, we can get rid of this one too.

2507
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:50,760
So uninstall.

2508
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:52,700
Store.

2509
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:55,300
Now...

2510
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:57,020
We can do everything!

2511
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:59,100
Yeah!

2512
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:02,340
Now we can do everything!

2513
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:06,400
No questions.

2514
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:07,480
What, to the lady?

2515
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,260
She just left.

2516
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:11,080
Was there something?

2517
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:18,260
I think we're good.

2518
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,040
Toss the crab in the storage.

2519
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:21,480
I think I should sell him.

2520
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,820
Or rather, my storage.

2521
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:25,480
I think I have some crabs in the storage.

2522
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:26,420
Oh no, he's running!

2523
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:29,180
And I'm gonna use the research.

2524
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:34,900
Yes.

2525
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:38,340
But I don't have that guy, so...

2526
02:14:39,140 --> 02:14:39,820
Done.

2527
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:42,540
Okay, sell my fish.

2528
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:43,960
I get 5 bucks.

2529
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:47,160
My rotting crab.

2530
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:49,260
And we're going to research.

2531
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:51,440
And we're going to...

2532
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:56,940
What the heck are...

2533
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:58,760
Oh my gosh, this gets so intense.

2534
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:04,480
Mangrove?

2535
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:06,140
Volcanic?

2536
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:09,220
This is...

2537
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:10,620
Abyssal?

2538
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,440
Are these spoilers?

2539
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:17,970
What?

2540
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:19,650
Oh no.

2541
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:20,670
I see.

2542
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:23,350
It's okay.

2543
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:29,370
We have to unlock this anyway to get to these, so...

2544
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:31,570
Lava fish.

2545
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,720
Get other tabs.

2546
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,500
What are you talking about?

2547
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:43,220
Like these?

2548
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,120
Oh wait, hold on.

2549
02:15:47,860 --> 02:15:48,200
Sorry.

2550
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:23,100
I wasted it.

2551
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:25,020
And then we lost the other one.

2552
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:29,800
Can I get it back pretty please?

2553
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:35,300
Rookie move.

2554
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:36,840
I am a rookie.

2555
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:39,880
Hold on.

2556
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:41,580
We gotta get that scrap.

2557
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,060
Let's see.

2558
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:44,860
We need the fiddler crab.

2559
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:46,880
Alright, so we got...

2560
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:52,660
We found the key and that's it.

2561
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:53,800
Okay.

2562
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:55,880
Our map.

2563
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:57,540
Steel Point.

2564
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,920
I like the...

2565
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:03,800
Oh, that's where our...

2566
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:04,680
Oh, okay, okay.

2567
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:06,900
Got it.

2568
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,340
So I'm assuming...

2569
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:10,600
Wait, do we have to go there at night or...

2570
02:17:14,490 --> 02:17:15,930
There is scrap by Steel Point.

2571
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:16,550
Got it.

2572
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:17,270
Thank you.

2573
02:17:19,610 --> 02:17:21,870
I'm assuming we have to go at night, no?

2574
02:17:27,590 --> 02:17:28,750
I will go check.

2575
02:17:31,870 --> 02:17:32,270
No?

2576
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:34,170
A night vision...

2577
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:34,870
Oh, sorry.

2578
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:35,930
I was reading chat.

2579
02:17:36,250 --> 02:17:37,590
It's a good thing it was just a buoy.

2580
02:17:38,170 --> 02:17:39,450
Oh my gosh, I just repaired my ship.

2581
02:17:41,670 --> 02:17:43,290
Pay attention Minto, what's your problem?

2582
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:48,310
Alright, now we can fish at our own leisure.

2583
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:50,150
Yeah!

2584
02:17:50,890 --> 02:17:51,690
One hour.

2585
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:53,310
Oh my gosh, we got him!

2586
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:57,870
I'm gonna go give it right now.

2587
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:03,410
I don't want to waste time.

2588
02:18:04,710 --> 02:18:05,570
Let's just go.

2589
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:09,390
Hold on, let me check my map again.

2590
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:14,070
Yeah, I'm on the right way.

2591
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:17,350
But I'm gonna storm.

2592
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:17,510
Storm room.

2593
02:18:20,410 --> 02:18:21,570
It's gonna spoil.

2594
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:24,650
Don't let the...

2595
02:18:24,650 --> 02:18:26,110
Okay, okay, you guys are right.

2596
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:27,490
I don't want it to spoil.

2597
02:18:28,190 --> 02:18:29,790
You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

2598
02:18:30,390 --> 02:18:31,310
You're right, you're right.

2599
02:18:33,390 --> 02:18:34,650
Still rots in storage.

2600
02:18:34,810 --> 02:18:36,350
Okay, we'll go give it now.

2601
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:38,710
I think I saw ViviCorp.

2602
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:39,650
For the gifted.

2603
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:40,250
Thank you!

2604
02:18:47,910 --> 02:18:48,630
It's okay.

2605
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:55,120
Take it.

2606
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:56,920
Yeah, I got your crabs.

2607
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:58,500
I got your crabs.

2608
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:01,740
Alright.

2609
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:03,100
Hands you some money.

2610
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:03,940
These will do.

2611
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:05,280
Glad you got to use...

2612
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:07,100
Some use out of that old pot.

2613
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:08,280
You can always buy more here.

2614
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:09,680
Repair damaged ones at the shipyard.

2615
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:11,340
I have one final request for you.

2616
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:14,760
As you've seen, some fish around here can develop odd deformities.

2617
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:18,680
What do you think happens to a person that eats the flesh of one of these mutants?

2618
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:20,920
They go mad.

2619
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:23,360
Well, perhaps.

2620
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:24,860
But I want to know for sure.

2621
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:29,760
He's going to poison the people.

2622
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:32,640
What?

2623
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,000
Bring me a mutant fish.

2624
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:35,620
Any will do.

2625
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:37,420
Just keep this between the two of us.

2626
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:41,340
I would have had one for you, but...

2627
02:19:44,860 --> 02:19:45,340
Unfortunately...

2628
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:46,460
I...

2629
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:49,860
I got attacked by a killer rock.

2630
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:51,940
Actually, no.

2631
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:53,460
I got attacked by an actual fish.

2632
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:56,820
I got attacked by a killer fish.

2633
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:03,060
Gekko!

2634
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,280
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

2635
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:05,220
Thank you.

2636
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:06,880
Is this a coastal?

2637
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:09,680
Yeah.

2638
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:11,400
We don't need any more.

2639
02:20:11,580 --> 02:20:11,840
Wait.

2640
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:14,900
Can we still give...

2641
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:17,000
Give perved fish?

2642
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:19,260
The bent fish?

2643
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:20,780
Little fish?

2644
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:26,580
No?

2645
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:27,460
One and done?

2646
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:28,560
Okay.

2647
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:30,060
Sad.

2648
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:34,860
Alrighty.

2649
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:36,320
We are looking...

2650
02:20:37,740 --> 02:20:38,540
For a thing.

2651
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:42,440
Around here.

2652
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:45,760
And we can sleep here, so that's not so bad, I feel.

2653
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:47,180
Is that it right here?

2654
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:50,840
I think...

2655
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:51,760
Oh, it's a shipwreck.

2656
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:52,780
I think so.

2657
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:54,080
I think we...

2658
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:54,760
I think...

2659
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:57,020
We found this...

2660
02:20:57,320 --> 02:20:58,220
Wood!

2661
02:21:05,480 --> 02:21:06,040
Wood.

2662
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:18,240
Depleted.

2663
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:20,500
It's already so late?

2664
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:21,200
Excuse me?

2665
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:22,700
At least wood doesn't...

2666
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,780
Doesn't die.

2667
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:34,660
A goblet.

2668
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:37,940
Can I...

2669
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:42,460
Can I put you in storage?

2670
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:42,780
No.

2671
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:47,760
Harry.

2672
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:50,820
Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?

2673
02:21:54,060 --> 02:21:56,160
Do we see any mysterious...

2674
02:21:58,140 --> 02:22:00,340
I think that's it over there, maybe.

2675
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:02,940
But first we sleep.

2676
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:11,640
Thank you Mint for being...

2677
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:12,860
What did I do?

2678
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:16,860
This is the island where the builder wants materials.

2679
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:19,060
I forgot.

2680
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:20,500
This is where she wants it.

2681
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:25,420
We sleep.

2682
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:34,870
Wow, we were so rested.

2683
02:22:36,470 --> 02:22:38,590
Probably the first in a long time.

2684
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,510
Nice.

2685
02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:42,250
Is this it?

2686
02:22:43,210 --> 02:22:44,410
Is this a dredge?

2687
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:45,450
Dredge!

2688
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:47,450
This is...

2689
02:22:49,550 --> 02:22:50,830
Something fascinating!

2690
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:58,830
I hope I'm not stressing you guys out with this.

2691
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:04,450
Why is it sometimes I can store in my...

2692
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:09,450
Why sometimes I can store in my storage but sometimes I can't?

2693
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:21,340
Storage is only when docked.

2694
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:21,920
Okay.

2695
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:26,440
Wakari Master.

2696
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:35,560
Scrap!

2697
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:42,000
Scrap.

2698
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:43,700
Scrap.

2699
02:23:45,820 --> 02:23:46,860
There's more.

2700
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,380
Scrap.

2701
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:52,300
Scrap.

2702
02:23:57,620 --> 02:23:59,140
Do I have more...

2703
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:00,660
I can make space.

2704
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:02,920
We can Tetris this.

2705
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:06,740
I'm a natural now.

2706
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:08,680
I play keep driving.

2707
02:24:16,030 --> 02:24:18,470
Maybe I'm not a natural.

2708
02:24:21,010 --> 02:24:23,050
But I can do another one.

2709
02:24:24,070 --> 02:24:24,510
lol

2710
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:36,840
Well, we can definitely put some of these on the island.

2711
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:42,580
Yeah!

2712
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:43,980
I didn't know that.

2713
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:45,480
That's actually why I wanted to play it.

2714
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,820
I was like, whoa, that's so spooky.

2715
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:49,360
You know?

2716
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:53,820
Storage and island.

2717
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:54,500
Alright.

2718
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:56,260
Alright.

2719
02:24:58,400 --> 02:24:58,840
You...

2720
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:00,960
And you.

2721
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:02,160
She's gonna...

2722
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:04,420
She's literally gonna Tony Stark it.

2723
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:09,000
She's building her house with a box of scraps.

2724
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:13,840
And...

2725
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:14,840
She will probably...

2726
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:16,580
Wait, see?

2727
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:19,120
No, it's still not...

2728
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:21,380
I'm docked but it's not letting me put it in storage.

2729
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,120
In a cave.

2730
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:27,420
No, on an island.

2731
02:25:34,070 --> 02:25:34,650
Okay.

2732
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:36,970
So it's gotta be...

2733
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:39,930
I understand, I understand.

2734
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:43,350
Let's go home.

2735
02:25:43,830 --> 02:25:46,170
Sorry, I'm playing it a little bit safe right now.

2736
02:25:48,030 --> 02:25:50,030
I'm playing it a little bit safe.

2737
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:51,890
Not cause I'm scared.

2738
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:53,080
But because...

2739
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:04,400
Better be safe than sorry.

2740
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:09,540
Why can I hear donuts now?

2741
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:18,640
Even a bird on high dies a glutton's death as do the fish of the deep.

2742
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:28,620
The fish that belong to a family called the deeps died from overfeeding and so did a bird that got...

2743
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:32,120
Octagon?

2744
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:33,780
Mayling?

2745
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:37,940
Okay.

2746
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:39,600
We talked to the builder.

2747
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:41,900
Let's get moving.

2748
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:44,300
Oh, I'm bringing you along.

2749
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:44,820
Okay.

2750
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:46,280
That's...

2751
02:26:46,280 --> 02:26:48,360
That's new to me.

2752
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:49,280
Okay.

2753
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:51,960
I didn't expect that.

2754
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:53,580
I'm gonna put her in storage.

2755
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:00,680
Okay, we put her in storage.

2756
02:27:04,060 --> 02:27:06,300
Actually though, we have some stuff.

2757
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:10,200
So let's see if we can dry dock something.

2758
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:15,230
Oh, I see.

2759
02:27:15,330 --> 02:27:16,790
Like I only need one cloth.

2760
02:27:17,390 --> 02:27:18,010
Oh, see.

2761
02:27:18,270 --> 02:27:19,090
I think we can do this.

2762
02:27:19,210 --> 02:27:19,410
Oops.

2763
02:27:19,690 --> 02:27:20,910
I think we can do this actually.

2764
02:27:27,150 --> 02:27:29,170
You and you.

2765
02:27:30,470 --> 02:27:30,790
Yeah!

2766
02:27:31,570 --> 02:27:32,370
We got the upgrade.

2767
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:38,810
Not exactly cruise liner conditions.

2768
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:39,850
She can live.

2769
02:27:39,970 --> 02:27:40,450
She'll live.

2770
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:42,290
She'll live.

2771
02:27:42,450 --> 02:27:42,970
She'll live.

2772
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:47,190
Modifies one cargo space to also hold lights.

2773
02:27:47,210 --> 02:27:47,550
Okay.

2774
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:49,970
I think we'll do...

2775
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:54,310
the engine maybe next.

2776
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,170
What do I have left?

2777
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:01,370
We have wood.

2778
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:02,950
Wait, I think...

2779
02:28:02,950 --> 02:28:05,510
Was anything like two wood and then a cloth?

2780
02:28:07,170 --> 02:28:09,150
Two cloth and one wood.

2781
02:28:09,530 --> 02:28:10,530
One wood, two scrap.

2782
02:28:11,410 --> 02:28:11,950
Okay.

2783
02:28:11,950 --> 02:28:12,350
No.

2784
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:14,450
Gosh, we're just like...

2785
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:15,710
We're just a little bit off.

2786
02:28:16,370 --> 02:28:17,230
That's okay though.

2787
02:28:17,630 --> 02:28:18,750
We'll get it easily.

2788
02:28:19,050 --> 02:28:21,230
And we can go sell this goblet and sell this lady.

2789
02:28:28,330 --> 02:28:30,250
I wish I got more books.

2790
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:43,320
There's no storage at Steel Peak though.

2791
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:45,980
That's okay.

2792
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,320
There might be once we have her.

2793
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:51,480
Once we put her in.

2794
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:55,320
Thank you.

2795
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:58,200
Uh, that's my name.

2796
02:28:58,580 --> 02:28:59,700
Don't wear it out.

2797
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:03,520
Alrighty.

2798
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,640
I don't think there's so much...

2799
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:11,420
Wait, can I...

2800
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:12,900
I can't get it yet though.

2801
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:14,540
Oh, I already bought it.

2802
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:15,180
No!

2803
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:16,220
I didn't mean to.

2804
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:21,440
Okay, we'll go for the spotlight thing next.

2805
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:24,540
Can I refund?

2806
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:27,220
Press F?

2807
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:27,540
Oh.

2808
02:29:30,340 --> 02:29:32,980
It's like half the money though that I spent.

2809
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:33,400
That's okay.

2810
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:34,300
We'll just keep it in storage.

2811
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:35,760
We'll use it eventually.

2812
02:29:40,620 --> 02:29:41,520
It's too late.

2813
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:44,520
Oh, so if I were to make a mistake...

2814
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,200
I could...

2815
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:49,320
Do F immediately.

2816
02:29:51,340 --> 02:29:52,220
Something, something.

2817
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,820
I'm dead, but I still live and learn.

2818
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:59,920
I don't know another expression that counts for ghosts of the same variety.

2819
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:03,500
If you don't put it in storage.

2820
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:04,040
Okay.

2821
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:06,220
But like I said, we're still gonna use it, so...

2822
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:08,080
It could have been worse.

2823
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:14,030
07 money.

2824
02:30:15,570 --> 02:30:16,450
My money.

2825
02:30:17,290 --> 02:30:17,850
Wait, is this...

2826
02:30:17,850 --> 02:30:19,310
This looks like a dredging location.

2827
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:22,790
Everybody prepare to dredge.

2828
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:32,700
Ooh.

2829
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:35,660
Pearl earrings.

2830
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:37,120
How fancy.

2831
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:46,700
Oh, I think I just realized what you meant that we don't have...

2832
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:50,180
We don't have storage on the island.

2833
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:53,160
Because I put the lady in storage.

2834
02:30:56,200 --> 02:30:58,680
You were like, Mito, you don't have storage on the island.

2835
02:30:58,680 --> 02:30:59,640
And I was like, it's okay.

2836
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:01,120
I don't need anything.

2837
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:07,080
Okay, we'll have to go back home.

2838
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:07,940
Oh no!

2839
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:09,920
No way.

2840
02:31:10,660 --> 02:31:11,560
Put him in storage?

2841
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:13,040
No!

2842
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:14,100
No!

2843
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:15,360
No!

2844
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:17,860
I can't Tetris myself out of this.

2845
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:26,340
Will the earrings?

2846
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:28,700
How?

2847
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:31,560
It won't let me.

2848
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:35,080
It won't let me.

2849
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:42,380
Place on the left?

2850
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:45,340
Oh, I see what you mean.

2851
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:49,420
Thank you guys.

2852
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:52,780
Thank you.

2853
02:31:54,060 --> 02:31:55,500
There's something shiny over here.

2854
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:58,740
Alright, we're gonna have to go retrieve our little lady.

2855
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:03,480
A once strong wooden hole lays broken against the shoreline.

2856
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:04,740
The stern is completely beached.

2857
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:06,900
Try to get inside the stern.

2858
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:10,660
You pull a bit closer and manage to clamber into the back of the wreck.

2859
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:11,720
You look around.

2860
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:14,000
Stuff.

2861
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:20,840
I can't take the scrap, but we'll come back for it.

2862
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:24,720
We shall return.

2863
02:32:29,900 --> 02:32:32,460
For now, let's go sell our wares.

2864
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:34,440
And wonders.

2865
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:36,320
Thanks for streaming.

2866
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:37,140
Thank you!

2867
02:32:37,480 --> 02:32:39,540
Thank you so much for the super chat.

2868
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:40,740
I really appreciate it.

2869
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:43,780
Wait, I think it went so fast and it's your name.

2870
02:32:46,300 --> 02:32:46,780
Aventurine!

2871
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:47,540
Thank you.

2872
02:32:53,900 --> 02:32:58,300
And I can get our lady out of storage on this island.

2873
02:32:59,300 --> 02:33:00,540
Everything's a win, right?

2874
02:33:02,180 --> 02:33:03,620
Yeah, Minto.

2875
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,940
You're playing the game correctly.

2876
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:07,660
Thanks chat.

2877
02:33:31,610 --> 02:33:34,870
Sell all trinkets.

2878
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:37,250
Okay, nice.

2879
02:33:38,990 --> 02:33:42,230
And since we are here, I'm going to use it on the engine.

2880
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:45,790
Now we can go buy the better engine.

2881
02:33:46,850 --> 02:33:50,590
I probably could have unlocked the other thing, but it's fine.

2882
02:33:51,790 --> 02:33:53,110
We need a better engine, I think.

2883
02:33:53,470 --> 02:33:54,810
Dredge is one of my favorite games ever.

2884
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:56,230
I hope you're enjoying it.

2885
02:33:56,250 --> 02:33:56,590
I am!

2886
02:33:56,730 --> 02:33:57,590
I'm having so much fun.

2887
02:33:59,610 --> 02:34:03,370
Oh, I can't let our little lady friend out yet.

2888
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:03,890
That's okay.

2889
02:34:03,890 --> 02:34:08,130
We undocked and we head over to our other place.

2890
02:34:15,640 --> 02:34:18,080
Did I have any...

2891
02:34:18,620 --> 02:34:20,220
One moment please.

2892
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:23,460
One moment please.

2893
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:28,120
The goblet!

2894
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:34,200
I knew I had something to sell.

2895
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:40,860
I was like, I knew I had something to sell.

2896
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:55,280
Harry Potter would be so sad right now to know his favorite goblet is gone.

2897
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:57,760
More money!

2898
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:07,220
Alright lady, I know, sorry, it's taken us two days to take you to the island.

2899
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:09,160
But it's really hard work, okay?

2900
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:09,920
You gotta understand.

2901
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:12,800
How much money is this new engine?

2902
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:18,580
These are probably fresh.

2903
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:19,880
They are fresh.

2904
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:21,540
Oh my gosh, wait.

2905
02:35:22,400 --> 02:35:24,760
I have a peculiar engine and then...

2906
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:28,520
Yeah!

2907
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:31,500
How much faster is this?

2908
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:32,060
15!

2909
02:35:44,350 --> 02:35:44,710
Okay!

2910
02:35:45,930 --> 02:35:46,790
New engine!

2911
02:35:51,060 --> 02:35:54,000
I like how when you sell something it just goes back into the inventory.

2912
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:56,840
Alright, let's see.

2913
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:00,880
We're zooming.

2914
02:36:01,480 --> 02:36:02,160
We're zooming.

2915
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:04,620
Alright, rise and shine lady.

2916
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,460
I need you out of my inventory, out of my storage.

2917
02:36:07,460 --> 02:36:12,140
And we're set in sail!

2918
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:20,690
Okay!

2919
02:36:22,070 --> 02:36:23,490
What a beautiful morning.

2920
02:36:23,550 --> 02:36:24,430
Good morning Mito!

2921
02:36:25,150 --> 02:36:26,450
Good morning Mito!

2922
02:36:31,570 --> 02:36:35,890
The music almost seems like Minecraft-esque sometimes, you know?

2923
02:36:37,070 --> 02:36:38,150
I'm gonna fish right here.

2924
02:36:40,350 --> 02:36:42,130
What if we get a spooky fish?

2925
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:47,980
It's morning!

2926
02:36:49,460 --> 02:36:49,960
Morning!

2927
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:50,820
It's morning!

2928
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:51,840
Wake up!

2929
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:52,260
Wake up!

2930
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:53,020
Wake up!

2931
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:53,400
Wake up!

2932
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:53,720
Wake up!

2933
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:01,940
How silly.

2934
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:03,880
Minecraft is a horror game and this isn't.

2935
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:05,320
So true.

2936
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:07,660
Mito cute.

2937
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:07,740
Search.

2938
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:14,940
Yes, yes this will do.

2939
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:15,620
Thank you fella.

2940
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:18,840
Give me a short while to get things built here.

2941
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:19,860
You're welcome back anytime.

2942
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:23,400
She reaches into her toolbox and pulls out a handful of components.

2943
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:25,160
Take these.

2944
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:26,200
Always good to have...

2945
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:26,820
Two!

2946
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:28,380
Two!

2947
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:34,880
I thought she would only give me one!

2948
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:43,520
It's only at 10 AM so I'm still gonna search around this island a little bit.

2949
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:48,620
This was scrap I think, right?

2950
02:37:58,070 --> 02:37:58,950
Metal scrap.

2951
02:38:01,130 --> 02:38:02,010
All depleted.

2952
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:06,420
Maybe this is it.

2953
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:08,860
Are you guys sure I don't have to get it at night?

2954
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:11,180
I'm sure feeling that way.

2955
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:19,300
Get what?

2956
02:38:19,460 --> 02:38:20,680
The cursed item.

2957
02:38:36,310 --> 02:38:38,830
It's not here, but it was so shown on the map.

2958
02:38:50,830 --> 02:38:52,190
Must drop the scrap.

2959
02:38:52,590 --> 02:38:53,550
My scrap!

2960
02:38:55,590 --> 02:38:57,190
The map was marking the quest for you.

2961
02:38:57,850 --> 02:38:58,850
Oh, you think it was that?

2962
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:07,300
Ewww.

2963
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,560
My scrap!

2964
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:11,120
My scrap!

2965
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:13,840
My scrap!

2966
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:17,380
Drop the fish?

2967
02:39:17,980 --> 02:39:18,280
Yeah.

2968
02:39:18,740 --> 02:39:19,320
Goodbye fish.

2969
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:20,600
You live another day.

2970
02:39:20,840 --> 02:39:21,440
Wait, hold on then.

2971
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:24,280
Oh, you're right.

2972
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:27,400
Hold on.

2973
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:38,920
Gale cliffs.

2974
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:45,680
Gale cliffs.

2975
02:39:45,880 --> 02:39:46,900
Where is that?

2976
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:50,180
Here!

2977
02:39:52,260 --> 02:39:53,460
All the way!

2978
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:56,680
OK.

2979
02:39:57,960 --> 02:39:58,900
I learned.

2980
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:02,920
I learned.

2981
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:04,280
SOS!

2982
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:07,480
Are they OK?

2983
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:10,920
I'm saved!

2984
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:12,080
Saved!

2985
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:14,680
Oh, you were a sight for these sore eyes.

2986
02:40:15,180 --> 02:40:16,380
What happened?

2987
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:18,420
I washed up here.

2988
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:20,900
Oh, it must be some two weeks ago now.

2989
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:25,760
We were in rough seas and when a wave hit us broadside I was jostled overboard and swept away.

2990
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:29,420
I don't have room on board for you, mister.

2991
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:31,520
I have scrap.

2992
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:37,620
I thought my crew would have come to find me by now, but yours is the first ship I've seen pass by here.

2993
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:41,700
Did the boy send you looking for me?

2994
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:45,040
No.

2995
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:47,580
Oh, well, I'm sure they're out there looking anyway.

2996
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:50,080
Can you get me to Little Morrow, stranger?

2997
02:40:50,580 --> 02:40:53,320
I should be able to catch them there when they stop by next.

2998
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:55,000
Yes.

2999
02:40:55,220 --> 02:40:56,080
Oh, yes, yes.

3000
02:40:56,200 --> 02:40:57,520
Sorry buddy, you're going to have to...

3001
02:40:58,480 --> 02:41:00,320
Oh, you're just going to leave me here to starve to death?

3002
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:01,280
Curse you.

3003
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:02,900
I'll be back.

3004
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:40,400
It was like a destiny.

3005
02:41:41,420 --> 02:41:44,020
It was like a divine... You know what?

3006
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:46,680
We lost that and not the research parts.

3007
02:41:47,720 --> 02:41:48,000
Uh-oh.

3008
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:49,180
It's getting dark though.

3009
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:50,600
OK, we gotta go.

3010
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:52,080
We gotta go, gotta go.

3011
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:53,380
Oh gosh, wait.

3012
02:41:53,420 --> 02:41:54,860
I don't want to lose the research parts.

3013
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:58,120
This is...

3014
02:42:03,380 --> 02:42:04,460
Where am I?

3015
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:13,060
Wrong way?

3016
02:42:22,310 --> 02:42:23,830
Heading the right way.

3017
02:42:25,990 --> 02:42:29,690
Do you think we can make it to...

3018
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:37,420
Do you think we can make it to...

3019
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:39,200
Steel Point?

3020
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:44,580
Remember Haste.

3021
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:47,340
But we lose part of our boat, no?

3022
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,520
Beware of overheating.

3023
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,620
Little Morrow is closer.

3024
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:08,000
Hold on.

3025
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:10,320
Planet Mike, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

3026
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:11,080
Thank you.

3027
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:12,660
Thank you, thank you.

3028
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:15,340
Speed.

3029
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:15,440
Speed.

3030
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:39,700
Oh, I see how it works now.

3031
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:40,060
OK.

3032
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:43,240
I thought it was gonna destroy our ship.

3033
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:47,880
I see how it works now.

3034
02:43:53,010 --> 02:43:53,890
OK, OK.

3035
02:43:57,330 --> 02:43:59,350
And this is where he needs to go anyway.

3036
02:43:59,650 --> 02:44:00,390
So we're fine.

3037
02:44:01,390 --> 02:44:02,730
Hohohohoho.

3038
02:44:04,910 --> 02:44:07,190
The sweet rank smell of civilization.

3039
02:44:07,650 --> 02:44:09,450
I think the rank smell is you, buddy.

3040
02:44:09,450 --> 02:44:11,970
I thought I could never miss it.

3041
02:44:12,230 --> 02:44:13,010
He turns to you.

3042
02:44:13,050 --> 02:44:15,170
For someone who has just been saved, he seems gloomy.

3043
02:44:15,690 --> 02:44:18,050
I've not got much on me, as you can imagine.

3044
02:44:18,550 --> 02:44:21,290
And I have a feeling this isn't worth much anymore, for me at least.

3045
02:44:21,370 --> 02:44:22,990
But perhaps it'll be worth something to you.

3046
02:44:23,890 --> 02:44:27,270
He removes a signet ring from his left hand and presses it.

3047
02:44:29,690 --> 02:44:30,370
It's yours.

3048
02:44:30,690 --> 02:44:33,830
It's emblazoned with a symbol of a captain's wheel.

3049
02:44:35,630 --> 02:44:36,510
Sounds fancy.

3050
02:44:37,550 --> 02:44:39,410
On to better horizons, friend.

3051
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:40,290
Farewell.

3052
02:44:41,810 --> 02:44:42,290
OK.

3053
02:44:42,850 --> 02:44:44,010
Wait, can we sell this?

3054
02:44:46,530 --> 02:44:47,770
What am I getting?

3055
02:44:48,070 --> 02:44:48,930
Oh, he gave me a book.

3056
02:44:49,350 --> 02:44:49,750
Nice.

3057
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:52,810
90 bucks.

3058
02:44:55,370 --> 02:44:57,370
Wait, should I sell this?

3059
02:44:58,170 --> 02:45:01,990
The ship's wheel sigil is emblazoned proudly on this ring.

3060
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:05,850
Such a symbol is sure to bring good luck to any captain that holds it.

3061
02:45:07,710 --> 02:45:08,150
Sell?

3062
02:45:08,150 --> 02:45:09,130
It's just loot?

3063
02:45:10,190 --> 02:45:11,090
Is it actually?

3064
02:45:16,130 --> 02:45:16,690
Keep it?

3065
02:45:17,610 --> 02:45:18,510
I can't tell.

3066
02:45:18,610 --> 02:45:20,750
Some people are saying keep it and some people are saying it's loot.

3067
02:45:25,940 --> 02:45:27,020
I can't tell.

3068
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,660
It's fine to sell.

3069
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:34,440
It doesn't do anything.

3070
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:35,080
OK.

3071
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:37,280
I feel like if it did something it would tell us, right?

3072
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:41,740
Well, no going back now.

3073
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:43,800
OK.

3074
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:47,780
That was so scary.

3075
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:50,880
But now I understand how the...

3076
02:45:52,220 --> 02:45:53,060
What's it called?

3077
02:45:53,220 --> 02:45:54,860
The haste.

3078
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:59,900
I thought it was like actively going to destroy our ship.

3079
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:01,800
What's the painter?

3080
02:46:02,700 --> 02:46:03,600
Ah, the fisherman.

3081
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:05,060
I thought you might stop by.

3082
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:06,440
Welcome to my humble studio.

3083
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:12,180
If you're wanting to experiment with some decorations, yes, I'm the person to talk to.

3084
02:46:12,480 --> 02:46:13,420
What sort of decorations?

3085
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:17,580
I can attach flags and bunting to add some style to your boat.

3086
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:19,680
I have a design here already that you might like.

3087
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:23,880
If you find any others on your travels, bring them back to me and I can rig them up for you.

3088
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:27,440
Of course I can also add a splash of color to your whole...

3089
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:30,820
I'm sorry to say that my selection of pigments limited at the moment though.

3090
02:46:31,780 --> 02:46:32,960
How can I find more pigment?

3091
02:46:34,740 --> 02:46:35,620
He thinks.

3092
02:46:36,300 --> 02:46:41,200
The other day down by the shoreline I saw a strange crab with the most strikingly vibrant coloration.

3093
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:45,780
My knees aren't suited to clambering over rocks and chasing crustaceans, you see.

3094
02:46:46,260 --> 02:46:47,960
But if you caught such a creature...

3095
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:52,900
He clears scraps of cloth and paper from his workbench, revealing a large pester and mortar.

3096
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:57,500
With the right binding agent we can grind them together for a new mixture.

3097
02:47:00,820 --> 02:47:02,720
He turns back to you.

3098
02:47:02,760 --> 02:47:04,900
A cunning plan formed in his mind.

3099
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:06,520
This is kind of morbid.

3100
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:09,260
Fisherman, bring me some of those strange crabs.

3101
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,040
Okay.

3102
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:13,760
For now, what can I help you with?

3103
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:16,120
I want to paint my boat.

3104
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:19,160
We're going to paint the roof.

3105
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:20,320
What color?

3106
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:26,580
Wait, is this the crab?

3107
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:26,900
Crab!

3108
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:38,800
We could do a sharp mint, but we need the strange crabs.

3109
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:41,220
Oh man.

3110
02:47:42,180 --> 02:47:44,760
Let's do skewy green and see how it looks.

3111
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:49,800
Oh, it looks like throw-up.

3112
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:52,300
Much better.

3113
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:52,840
Where?

3114
02:47:53,860 --> 02:47:55,840
Hold on, let's try...

3115
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:56,560
Blue depth.

3116
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:57,740
Oh, there's another page.

3117
02:47:57,800 --> 02:47:58,140
Hold on.

3118
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:02,720
I like that.

3119
02:48:04,100 --> 02:48:05,640
Hold on, what other colors do you have?

3120
02:48:06,480 --> 02:48:07,440
Next page.

3121
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:12,180
Maple, orange, royal purple, golden treasure, black abyss.

3122
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:15,420
Let's do the hole.

3123
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:17,620
And we'll do it blue depth.

3124
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,660
Do you guys see a difference?

3125
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:27,360
Do you guys see a difference?

3126
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:29,100
I don't see a difference.

3127
02:48:30,620 --> 02:48:31,960
I want crab.

3128
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:35,940
No.

3129
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:38,720
I don't see a difference.

3130
02:48:40,220 --> 02:48:41,880
Okay, thank you sir.

3131
02:48:42,300 --> 02:48:43,540
Wait, can I change my...

3132
02:48:43,540 --> 02:48:44,640
Let's see.

3133
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,220
Let's do a fish flag.

3134
02:48:46,580 --> 02:48:47,180
Cute!

3135
02:48:50,540 --> 02:48:51,140
And...

3136
02:48:51,140 --> 02:48:52,460
A bunting.

3137
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:55,400
Bunting on.

3138
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:02,000
Bunting off.

3139
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:03,720
What's the difference?

3140
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:07,180
I don't see a difference.

3141
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:12,160
Sharpen into my Yoshi.

3142
02:49:15,980 --> 02:49:17,160
What's bunting?

3143
02:49:17,560 --> 02:49:18,260
I don't know.

3144
02:49:23,190 --> 02:49:24,390
I don't see a difference.

3145
02:49:30,390 --> 02:49:32,210
We'll put it on though.

3146
02:49:37,420 --> 02:49:38,800
What are you doing here?

3147
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:40,460
We already know.

3148
02:49:41,620 --> 02:49:42,760
Splash of color.

3149
02:49:44,020 --> 02:49:45,000
Alright, bye bye.

3150
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:47,540
It's 2 AM.

3151
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:50,540
I think we should sleep.

3152
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:58,920
Okay, now before we venture off...

3153
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:06,040
Spooky, spooky, mysterious creature of the night.

3154
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:07,660
Bidet.

3155
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:13,140
Lumpy mackerel.

3156
02:50:13,820 --> 02:50:15,620
He's so gross.

3157
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:19,400
Nice.

3158
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:21,380
Let's go...

3159
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:24,800
Let's go sell this to this guy.

3160
02:50:24,800 --> 02:50:24,880
Okay.

3161
02:50:27,620 --> 02:50:29,120
Read the flavor text.

3162
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:37,340
A writhing mass of lumps, twisting and pulling their way under the scales of their vessel.

3163
02:50:37,980 --> 02:50:40,720
How long can it have lived like this?

3164
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:43,840
Since yesterday.

3165
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:45,400
Probably.

3166
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:53,060
I will voice what is on everyone's mind.

3167
02:50:53,300 --> 02:50:54,320
More whispers.

3168
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:57,700
I got a mutant!

3169
02:51:00,860 --> 02:51:02,700
There you go.

3170
02:51:02,980 --> 02:51:06,080
He takes the berated fish from you.

3171
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:10,380
He clutches it close to his chest, wringing his hands around its slimy body.

3172
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:12,880
Yes, this should do nicely.

3173
02:51:13,300 --> 02:51:14,320
Here's what the fish is worth.

3174
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:15,880
And why don't you take these...

3175
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:18,780
You were swimming in research.

3176
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:22,220
It sounds like the faintest whispering.

3177
02:51:22,220 --> 02:51:23,500
You listen.

3178
02:51:24,680 --> 02:51:25,080
Silence.

3179
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:29,020
In the stillness of the room, the fishmonger's hands begin to tremble.

3180
02:51:29,580 --> 02:51:30,940
His face grows anguished.

3181
02:51:31,560 --> 02:51:33,160
Please, sell what you need and leave.

3182
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:35,000
I must deal with this creature quickly now.

3183
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:36,660
I got nothing.

3184
02:51:37,060 --> 02:51:37,440
See ya.

3185
02:51:40,680 --> 02:51:42,580
The fishmonger's door slams behind you.

3186
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:45,020
You hear the heavy scraping of a metal bar sliding across it.

3187
02:51:45,640 --> 02:51:46,940
We've been locked out!

3188
02:51:47,660 --> 02:51:48,100
Maybe.

3189
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:48,140
Maybe.

3190
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:57,100
Okay, we got four research parts.

3191
02:51:58,460 --> 02:51:59,740
Refined outboard engine.

3192
02:52:00,280 --> 02:52:03,120
But I don't think we even have...

3193
02:52:04,960 --> 02:52:05,360
Actually...

3194
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:07,680
I don't think... do we?

3195
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:11,820
Oh, I guess, kind of, we have the space for that.

3196
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:17,960
Yeah, we have the space for that, actually.

3197
02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:20,940
We'd have to sell our other two, but...

3198
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:23,240
Or we could get this one.

3199
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:24,820
Twin prop engine.

3200
02:52:25,540 --> 02:52:28,360
This engine is outfitted with a dual propeller system, increasing speed.

3201
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:31,280
High quality components and excellent craftsmanship.

3202
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:33,440
A reliable engine trusted by seafarers.

3203
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:36,000
This one's just cheaper.

3204
02:52:39,240 --> 02:52:40,680
Super engine top, right?

3205
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:41,160
This one?

3206
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:42,400
I don't have enough.

3207
02:52:43,320 --> 02:52:44,480
Relatively new design.

3208
02:52:44,480 --> 02:52:50,000
This unit propels water through the system more efficiently than outboard propeller setups.

3209
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:53,780
Save one more.

3210
02:52:55,140 --> 02:52:56,600
Is this one that good?

3211
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:05,100
Yeah?

3212
02:53:05,560 --> 02:53:07,380
It's the best engines per block.

3213
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:12,140
Oh, because it's nine by four.

3214
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:16,160
Sorry, you have 9.5 and then you have four slots.

3215
02:53:18,080 --> 02:53:19,560
I'm doing math.

3216
02:53:25,250 --> 02:53:27,950
9.5 times four.

3217
02:53:29,190 --> 02:53:29,870
38.

3218
02:53:32,190 --> 02:53:36,330
And then this one is 36.8.

3219
02:53:38,150 --> 02:53:39,430
Is it that much of a difference?

3220
02:53:42,390 --> 02:53:43,110
I masked.

3221
02:53:48,130 --> 02:53:49,890
Plus it fits the eddy configuration.

3222
02:53:50,910 --> 02:53:51,850
Later on, yeah?

3223
02:53:55,450 --> 02:53:55,850
Okay.

3224
02:53:58,740 --> 02:54:00,560
I'll hold off on pots for now.

3225
02:54:04,620 --> 02:54:06,240
I guess I'll hold off on this too.

3226
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:13,480
So...

3227
02:54:13,480 --> 02:54:16,440
Storage, storage, storage, storage...

3228
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:18,140
Storage... Wait!

3229
02:54:18,440 --> 02:54:19,320
Oh yeah, that's right.

3230
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:21,240
I was like, when did I get injured?

3231
02:54:24,140 --> 02:54:25,300
I wonder when.

3232
02:54:25,420 --> 02:54:26,560
I gotta make some money though.

3233
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:29,380
We gotta make more money.

3234
02:54:38,550 --> 02:54:40,650
I can do this light space.

3235
02:54:50,140 --> 02:54:53,380
Yeah, which is actually good because we need that, no?

3236
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:57,320
Oh wait, it's a scrap.

3237
02:54:59,480 --> 02:55:00,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3238
02:55:10,960 --> 02:55:13,260
Okay, light and storage is good.

3239
02:55:14,500 --> 02:55:15,600
I did...

3240
02:55:20,210 --> 02:55:22,930
Modifies four rod spaces to also hold nets.

3241
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:26,690
Okay, that's why we haven't unlocked nets yet.

3242
02:55:27,490 --> 02:55:29,330
But now we can get this bad boy.

3243
02:55:32,690 --> 02:55:35,390
Oh, I have to get uninstalled.

3244
02:55:38,810 --> 02:55:40,010
And installed.

3245
02:55:41,970 --> 02:55:44,130
And I can at least sell this probably.

3246
02:55:44,970 --> 02:55:50,450
Actually, I'm gonna hold on to it for now unless if our setup changes for some reason.

3247
02:55:51,290 --> 02:55:52,430
Should be fine though.

3248
02:55:58,660 --> 02:56:00,100
Uninstall, uninstall.

3249
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:11,420
Gale Cliffs.

3250
02:56:17,160 --> 02:56:18,520
What did I just do?

3251
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:19,220
Remove.

3252
02:56:29,740 --> 02:56:30,960
Gale Cliffs.

3253
02:56:32,720 --> 02:56:34,800
That's south?

3254
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:39,840
So this way?

3255
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:40,700
No.

3256
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:43,280
Yes.

3257
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:46,000
We're going beyond.

3258
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:51,040
Is it bad if I use haste too much?

3259
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:54,600
Will that do anything?

3260
02:56:58,510 --> 02:56:59,590
Markers on the compass.

3261
02:56:59,730 --> 02:57:00,450
I don't see any.

3262
02:57:01,370 --> 02:57:01,990
Spam it?

3263
02:57:02,070 --> 02:57:02,310
Okay.

3264
02:57:03,390 --> 02:57:03,870
Okay,

3265
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:10,600
so this way.

3266
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:14,000
Just let it cool down.

3267
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:15,640
Got it.

3268
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:20,000
Got it, got it, got it.

3269
02:57:24,700 --> 02:57:26,460
Thank you guys for helping me out.

3270
02:57:26,500 --> 02:57:27,560
I really appreciate it.

3271
02:57:30,680 --> 02:57:32,700
Oh gosh, that scared me.

3272
02:57:35,800 --> 02:57:37,260
Little tiny island.

3273
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:40,040
I think we can explore this real quick.

3274
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:43,420
There's like a little something here.

3275
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:45,820
Wait, is that it?

3276
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:47,460
Yeah, I see it.

3277
02:57:47,940 --> 02:57:48,700
Land ho!

3278
02:57:52,620 --> 02:57:54,200
Okay, don't crash.

3279
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:56,840
You pull up to a wreck with a familiar looking hull.

3280
02:57:57,200 --> 02:57:59,380
It's almost identical to the ship given to you by the mayor.

3281
02:57:59,700 --> 02:58:01,900
Except this one has a huge breach on one side.

3282
02:58:02,800 --> 02:58:04,400
You're tied up alongside the old wreck.

3283
02:58:05,740 --> 02:58:06,740
Look in the cabin.

3284
02:58:09,820 --> 02:58:11,740
Check the cupboards and drawers.

3285
02:58:12,040 --> 02:58:14,020
They've been completely and methodically emptied.

3286
02:58:14,420 --> 02:58:15,260
All the drawers are missing.

3287
02:58:15,400 --> 02:58:16,140
You're in the cabin.

3288
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:17,620
Loose floorboard.

3289
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:19,360
There are no floorboards left.

3290
02:58:20,280 --> 02:58:21,340
You're in the cabin.

3291
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:25,700
Electrical equipment is still there, though surely exposure to the elements has fried the internals.

3292
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:29,220
You angle the overhead radio down to get a closer look.

3293
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:30,740
A note slips.

3294
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:33,860
You're in the cabin.

3295
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:37,680
Check out the cargo.

3296
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:41,680
Is this an engine?

3297
02:58:44,400 --> 02:58:45,920
Oh, I can't take it down.

3298
02:58:46,780 --> 02:58:52,200
18.9 No, still ours together is better.

3299
02:58:53,780 --> 02:58:55,000
And a coastal ride.

3300
02:58:55,080 --> 02:58:56,620
I'm going to take this and we can sell it.

3301
02:58:57,460 --> 02:58:59,960
Oh, but it adds us... nevermind.

3302
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:01,480
It adds two hours.

3303
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:02,200
Nevermind, nevermind.

3304
02:59:02,260 --> 02:59:02,800
Oh, to storage!

3305
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:05,060
Thank you, guys.

3306
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:08,260
To storage, to storage.

3307
02:59:09,780 --> 02:59:12,800
It's going to say it adds like two hours.

3308
02:59:12,920 --> 02:59:13,740
I don't want to do that.

3309
02:59:15,540 --> 02:59:16,940
There's something over there, too.

3310
02:59:19,740 --> 02:59:22,160
Goodness gracious, there's so much to explore.

3311
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:24,160
What is this?

3312
02:59:25,540 --> 02:59:27,220
I'm dredging, I'm dredging, I'm dredging.

3313
02:59:33,900 --> 02:59:36,200
It's like... I like that it's a rhythm game.

3314
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:39,140
Ouroboros flag!

3315
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:41,660
Uh-oh!

3316
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:45,880
Time to go, time to go, time to go, time to go.

3317
02:59:46,300 --> 02:59:47,760
Time to go, time to go, time to go.

3318
02:59:48,400 --> 02:59:50,020
Time to go, time to go, time to go.

3319
02:59:50,360 --> 02:59:52,000
Time to go, time to go, time to go.

3320
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:54,580
Time to go, time to go, time to go.

3321
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:56,760
It's our time to go.

3322
02:59:57,280 --> 02:59:58,540
Time to go, time to go, time to go.

3323
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:03,960
Time to go, time to go, time to go.

3324
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:06,020
Time to go, time to go, time to go.

3325
03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:08,080
It's our time to go.

3326
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:09,880
And I'm docked.

3327
03:00:20,050 --> 03:00:21,730
That was so scary.

3328
03:00:22,390 --> 03:00:24,090
Normal ocean things.

3329
03:00:25,190 --> 03:00:25,990
Let's see.

3330
03:00:52,030 --> 03:00:55,090
But our dog keeps digging them up and eating them.

3331
03:00:55,650 --> 03:00:58,150
I can't raise the subject without spoiling the surprise.

3332
03:00:59,030 --> 03:01:01,290
Can you bring me an aged conger eel?

3333
03:01:02,570 --> 03:01:03,130
Yes.

3334
03:01:05,050 --> 03:01:07,390
You'll be decently compensated.

3335
03:01:07,690 --> 03:01:10,550
She looks rich, so I think we will be.

3336
03:01:13,230 --> 03:01:14,230
Anything else?

3337
03:01:14,990 --> 03:01:16,230
Where can I catch one?

3338
03:01:16,230 --> 03:01:18,010
They can be tricky to find.

3339
03:01:18,050 --> 03:01:21,630
I'm told they inhabit the holes and burrows within the cliffs themselves.

3340
03:01:22,590 --> 03:01:28,790
Imagine they've been fished out of the edges, so you may have to venture into the passageway of the cliffs to find them.

3341
03:01:31,810 --> 03:01:33,270
She should give me the doggies.

3342
03:01:33,390 --> 03:01:34,850
What is the dog gonna do for me?

3343
03:01:35,790 --> 03:01:36,910
They only come out at night.

3344
03:01:37,570 --> 03:01:39,090
I do believe they hide during the day.

3345
03:01:39,650 --> 03:01:40,130
Good luck.

3346
03:01:40,830 --> 03:01:41,630
Anything else?

3347
03:01:41,810 --> 03:01:42,930
What can you tell me about the cliffs?

3348
03:01:43,390 --> 03:01:46,950
Many years ago, the cliffs used to be a haven for smugglers and pirates.

3349
03:01:47,210 --> 03:01:51,750
Legend tells of two pirate lords who used gale cliffs as their hideout.

3350
03:01:54,090 --> 03:01:58,630
Supposedly, they got into some disagreement and a huge battle was fought around the south side of the cliffs.

3351
03:01:59,150 --> 03:02:01,590
There certainly are a large number of wrecks in that area.

3352
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:03,810
It's a good travel partner.

3353
03:02:04,390 --> 03:02:06,630
They would eventually be able to fight things for me.

3354
03:02:08,590 --> 03:02:09,030
Probably.

3355
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:16,450
Some sailors might have used an eyepatch to keep one eye adjusted to the darkness.

3356
03:02:20,060 --> 03:02:21,780
Are you telling me...

3357
03:02:26,870 --> 03:02:28,030
to be a pirate?

3358
03:02:38,060 --> 03:02:38,760
Boss.

3359
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:40,380
Snake.

3360
03:02:41,960 --> 03:02:42,660
Arrgh.

3361
03:02:42,820 --> 03:02:43,820
I'm Pirate Snake.

3362
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:44,920
Arrgh.

3363
03:02:44,960 --> 03:02:45,060
Oh.

3364
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:46,960
Liquid.

3365
03:02:47,420 --> 03:02:48,840
I'm Sea Shanty Snake.

3366
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:50,200
Arrgh.

3367
03:02:50,240 --> 03:02:50,800
Arrgh.

3368
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:52,280
Arrgh.

3369
03:02:59,360 --> 03:03:01,220
I'm Sea Water Snake.

3370
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:04,120
Shanty karaoke win.

3371
03:03:07,500 --> 03:03:08,280
I don't know.

3372
03:03:09,100 --> 03:03:10,140
I don't know any.

3373
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:14,540
Both sides were completely destroyed.

3374
03:03:14,660 --> 03:03:17,440
Their treasure hordes left abandoned and unclaimed to this day.

3375
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:20,780
I dare say they'd be worth a lot if anyone knew where to find them.

3376
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:21,920
Anything else?

3377
03:03:21,920 --> 03:03:24,520
Any odd characters around this part?

3378
03:03:25,140 --> 03:03:27,520
Have you heard the tale of Magran?

3379
03:03:28,460 --> 03:03:30,580
He was an old whaler from these parts.

3380
03:03:31,900 --> 03:03:36,300
As the whales got more scarce, the crew spent longer and longer at sea trying to find them.

3381
03:03:36,740 --> 03:03:39,140
Magran, it seems, wasn't cut out for this.

3382
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:42,640
What do we do with a drunken Minto?

3383
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:44,110
What do we do...

3384
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:45,980
Oh, is this a shanty?

3385
03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:48,520
Scurvy Snake!

3386
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:54,940
As the whales got more...oh, it seems Magran wasn't cut out for this.

3387
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:59,140
He formed an unnatural attachment to a scroll he found on one of these trips.

3388
03:03:59,660 --> 03:04:03,800
He says the scroll told him how to become immortal by eating mutated fish.

3389
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:06,920
People started calling him Magran the Fishman.

3390
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:13,660
One day, the town awoke to find all the boats, nets, and lines had been slashed in the night.

3391
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:16,040
And old Magran was nowhere to be found.

3392
03:04:16,460 --> 03:04:18,420
Nor has he been seen since.

3393
03:04:24,010 --> 03:04:24,710
Uh-oh.

3394
03:04:26,130 --> 03:04:27,430
You don't think...

3395
03:04:28,390 --> 03:04:30,770
You don't think that's our fishman, right?

3396
03:04:32,050 --> 03:04:33,130
Where can I sell my fish here?

3397
03:04:33,370 --> 03:04:36,650
We catch our fish ourselves here, so we don't have much need for buying any.

3398
03:04:37,250 --> 03:04:38,590
But there's a merchant that travels around.

3399
03:04:38,690 --> 03:04:41,990
She's usually anchored across the bay and buys and sells almost anything.

3400
03:04:42,270 --> 03:04:43,090
She does repairs too.

3401
03:04:43,210 --> 03:04:43,850
Oh, nice.

3402
03:04:45,570 --> 03:04:46,030
Nothing.

3403
03:04:47,110 --> 03:04:49,110
We're gonna talk to the whaler?

3404
03:04:50,170 --> 03:04:50,870
What is it?

3405
03:04:50,870 --> 03:04:53,230
Uh, any shipwrecks?

3406
03:04:53,410 --> 03:04:56,670
The real wreck here is... around here is the settlement at Gale Cliffs.

3407
03:04:59,530 --> 03:05:00,690
For doubloons.

3408
03:05:03,770 --> 03:05:07,490
My brother ditched us and moved on over to those cliffs years ago.

3409
03:05:09,290 --> 03:05:10,230
Ugh, sorry.

3410
03:05:11,030 --> 03:05:13,530
I suspect he's regretting his decision now, the devil.

3411
03:05:14,050 --> 03:05:14,730
Anything else?

3412
03:05:15,850 --> 03:05:17,550
Any strange things in the area?

3413
03:05:17,550 --> 03:05:22,650
Some time ago, just after the last whale was brought in, there was a sudden exodus from Gale Cliffs.

3414
03:05:23,270 --> 03:05:24,410
What the heck is Gale Cliffs?

3415
03:05:25,170 --> 03:05:29,890
Dozens of ships sailed past, packed up and hurrying away north as fast as they could.

3416
03:05:30,590 --> 03:05:34,010
They were waving and shouting something at us from their boats, but we couldn't make it out.

3417
03:05:34,770 --> 03:05:37,030
Never did see or hear of them since.

3418
03:05:39,950 --> 03:05:41,630
Hey, what can you tell me about Ingfell?

3419
03:05:43,830 --> 03:05:47,670
One Chris Z said, welcome to membership, thank you!

3420
03:05:49,190 --> 03:05:49,670
C...P...

3421
03:05:49,670 --> 03:05:50,310
Yeah.

3422
03:05:51,310 --> 03:05:52,870
Ingfell used to be a whaling town.

3423
03:05:53,090 --> 03:05:54,290
Emphasis on the used to be.

3424
03:05:54,670 --> 03:05:59,690
We would go out, bring in a carcass and then the rest of the town would get to work.

3425
03:06:00,210 --> 03:06:03,890
But the whales got scarce some 20 years ago.

3426
03:06:04,250 --> 03:06:05,270
And look at us now.

3427
03:06:05,750 --> 03:06:07,970
Barely scrapping by for a new candle.

3428
03:06:11,630 --> 03:06:12,170
Can we eat?

3429
03:06:14,590 --> 03:06:16,610
I wanna know what they told them though.

3430
03:06:17,330 --> 03:06:18,310
Why did they leave?

3431
03:06:18,450 --> 03:06:19,690
Okay, so...

3432
03:06:19,690 --> 03:06:22,010
This is... Okay, we are at the Gale Cliffs.

3433
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:30,080
How mysterious.

3434
03:06:35,340 --> 03:06:38,080
I saw the light coming from over there.

3435
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:40,260
The spooky light, so...

3436
03:06:46,770 --> 03:06:47,810
Artifact manifest.

3437
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:49,790
Oh wait, I see it?

3438
03:06:51,810 --> 03:06:52,770
Oh my gosh.

3439
03:06:53,590 --> 03:06:55,230
Are these things common here?

3440
03:06:57,610 --> 03:06:59,990
Is it not gonna chase after me?

3441
03:07:03,730 --> 03:07:04,750
Maybe not.

3442
03:07:08,110 --> 03:07:10,050
I got a black mouth salmon.

3443
03:07:11,830 --> 03:07:13,450
It chased after before.

3444
03:07:18,010 --> 03:07:19,190
More salmon.

3445
03:07:24,010 --> 03:07:27,530
I'm guessing this is the lady that sells?

3446
03:07:28,090 --> 03:07:28,510
Or buys?

3447
03:07:29,730 --> 03:07:30,650
They chase at night.

3448
03:07:31,650 --> 03:07:33,150
I see, I see.

3449
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:36,590
I heard something strange.

3450
03:07:40,380 --> 03:07:40,660
Hello?

3451
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:43,800
Hello?

3452
03:07:49,710 --> 03:07:50,410
I'm docking?

3453
03:07:53,410 --> 03:07:58,790
I feel like we just finally have reached the game.

3454
03:07:58,930 --> 03:07:59,730
You know what I mean?

3455
03:08:01,490 --> 03:08:02,170
Ahoy there!

3456
03:08:02,470 --> 03:08:03,330
You're a new face.

3457
03:08:03,470 --> 03:08:04,430
A fisherman I take it?

3458
03:08:04,730 --> 03:08:05,010
Perfect!

3459
03:08:05,730 --> 03:08:08,070
Well, we should get along like a house on fire!

3460
03:08:10,350 --> 03:08:12,230
I call it chapter 2.

3461
03:08:12,630 --> 03:08:13,410
Yeah, that's fair.

3462
03:08:13,870 --> 03:08:16,850
I feel like we've done the prologue this whole time.

3463
03:08:16,850 --> 03:08:20,010
I'm a traveler and a merchant.

3464
03:08:20,330 --> 03:08:21,250
All rolled into one.

3465
03:08:21,710 --> 03:08:26,230
If you have any fish to sell, I'll take them on board and sell them at the next town I come across.

3466
03:08:26,790 --> 03:08:29,870
Likewise, I haul a small cargo of equipment between places.

3467
03:08:30,490 --> 03:08:34,010
You're welcome to peruse the stock and see if there's anything that takes your fancy.

3468
03:08:35,830 --> 03:08:37,510
Well, fish market.

3469
03:08:39,950 --> 03:08:41,150
I'm selling my fish.

3470
03:08:42,270 --> 03:08:43,730
Like I said, we need more money.

3471
03:08:43,730 --> 03:08:47,170
Have you met the photographer?

3472
03:08:47,430 --> 03:08:49,010
She stopped by my pontoon a little...

3473
03:08:49,010 --> 03:08:49,890
The photographer!

3474
03:08:50,150 --> 03:08:51,190
Someone mentioned that earlier.

3475
03:08:53,690 --> 03:08:58,130
Funny how earlier she said, I think we basically have the whole game unlocked.

3476
03:08:59,830 --> 03:09:03,690
She's loaded up with fancy camera equipment to take pictures of all the wildlife.

3477
03:09:04,190 --> 03:09:05,250
She sighs wistfully.

3478
03:09:05,710 --> 03:09:06,990
I wish I had my own camera.

3479
03:09:07,330 --> 03:09:08,910
Wouldn't it be nice to document everything you do?

3480
03:09:09,270 --> 03:09:10,350
You'd never forget anything.

3481
03:09:11,870 --> 03:09:12,390
Anyway...

3482
03:09:12,910 --> 03:09:16,410
She said she was setting up on a small island to the south of the morrows.

3483
03:09:16,870 --> 03:09:18,770
If you're in the area, maybe you should check on her.

3484
03:09:20,570 --> 03:09:21,670
What else you got?

3485
03:09:24,530 --> 03:09:25,410
Nothing new!

3486
03:09:26,410 --> 03:09:27,190
Just kidding.

3487
03:09:28,970 --> 03:09:29,850
Refined metal.

3488
03:09:32,650 --> 03:09:34,490
I can buy research parts.

3489
03:09:35,790 --> 03:09:36,230
Interesting.

3490
03:09:36,230 --> 03:09:36,330
Interesting.

3491
03:09:39,930 --> 03:09:41,510
And dry docks.

3492
03:09:41,950 --> 03:09:43,090
Oh, so I can upgrade here too.

3493
03:09:48,690 --> 03:09:49,210
Okay.

3494
03:09:49,810 --> 03:09:50,950
At least we saw that.

3495
03:09:58,400 --> 03:09:59,940
Let's check out the cliffs a little.

3496
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:02,420
We also have in here...

3497
03:10:04,040 --> 03:10:06,500
This is the creepy...the creepy...

3498
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:07,720
The creepy creepy.

3499
03:10:08,740 --> 03:10:09,720
The creepy creepy.

3500
03:10:09,940 --> 03:10:10,140
Wait.

3501
03:10:10,140 --> 03:10:12,480
Can I get in here?

3502
03:10:13,660 --> 03:10:14,840
A pile of loose debris.

3503
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,020
Clearing this would take some strong explosives.

3504
03:10:19,660 --> 03:10:20,180
Okay.

3505
03:10:24,060 --> 03:10:24,580
Okay.

3506
03:10:26,580 --> 03:10:28,300
We can't do that yet.

3507
03:10:32,350 --> 03:10:33,510
Let's go in here.

3508
03:10:33,630 --> 03:10:34,390
It's a little...

3509
03:10:44,730 --> 03:10:45,630
Reverse reverse!

3510
03:10:46,270 --> 03:10:46,970
Reverse reverse!

3511
03:10:50,870 --> 03:10:51,430
Reverse!

3512
03:10:51,770 --> 03:10:52,210
Keep going!

3513
03:10:52,490 --> 03:10:52,770
Keep going!

3514
03:10:53,010 --> 03:10:53,330
Keep going!

3515
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:56,250
I'm in trouble!

3516
03:10:56,710 --> 03:10:57,170
I'm in trouble!

3517
03:10:58,430 --> 03:10:58,990
No!

3518
03:11:09,290 --> 03:11:11,910
We might be on fire just a little bit.

3519
03:11:12,410 --> 03:11:14,950
I'm gonna waste all my money repairing the ship.

3520
03:11:22,070 --> 03:11:23,850
That was not good.

3521
03:11:25,470 --> 03:11:26,830
I shouldn't have looked back.

3522
03:11:26,850 --> 03:11:27,790
I didn't mean to.

3523
03:11:30,070 --> 03:11:30,870
Well, no.

3524
03:11:30,990 --> 03:11:33,030
I did mean to look back to see if he was following me.

3525
03:11:33,130 --> 03:11:34,290
Yeah, I shouldn't have looked back.

3526
03:11:34,710 --> 03:11:35,370
You're right.

3527
03:11:44,930 --> 03:11:46,710
Can you repair me?

3528
03:11:48,050 --> 03:11:49,130
How do you repair?

3529
03:11:58,930 --> 03:11:59,770
The shipyard.

3530
03:12:02,670 --> 03:12:03,730
I see, I see.

3531
03:12:04,430 --> 03:12:05,190
Thank you.

3532
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:16,540
We didn't lose anything though.

3533
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:29,440
I'll look around a little bit more before we sleep.

3534
03:12:31,020 --> 03:12:33,240
Is that thing just circling the island?

3535
03:12:40,160 --> 03:12:41,140
Killer whales!

3536
03:12:43,300 --> 03:12:44,500
They're so cute!

3537
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:47,160
What if I get kinda close?

3538
03:12:49,820 --> 03:12:51,080
They're so cute!

3539
03:12:53,480 --> 03:12:54,960
I should head back.

3540
03:12:57,180 --> 03:12:57,820
Sorry.

3541
03:13:04,300 --> 03:13:05,520
Oh, I read it.

3542
03:13:05,620 --> 03:13:05,980
Nice.

3543
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:07,640
Check cabin for bonuses.

3544
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:13,680
Now we get 10% resilience to panic.

3545
03:13:14,380 --> 03:13:15,920
I mean that actually.

3546
03:13:17,620 --> 03:13:19,360
I mean that actually!

3547
03:13:24,220 --> 03:13:25,660
Let's dock.

3548
03:13:26,780 --> 03:13:28,320
We'll dock over down here.

3549
03:13:30,320 --> 03:13:32,340
Well, I know I need explosives.

3550
03:13:34,580 --> 03:13:36,300
Which I do not have.

3551
03:13:40,340 --> 03:13:42,320
So it's kinda stinky.

3552
03:13:43,460 --> 03:13:45,960
I got a black sea bass.

3553
03:13:46,900 --> 03:13:52,800
More sea bass.

3554
03:13:53,900 --> 03:13:55,160
Talk to the merchant.

3555
03:13:55,280 --> 03:13:55,700
I will!

3556
03:13:56,220 --> 03:13:57,300
I will.

3557
03:14:04,540 --> 03:14:05,500
Depleted.

3558
03:14:17,640 --> 03:14:19,080
So far, OK.

3559
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:20,160
So far, so good.

3560
03:14:22,380 --> 03:14:23,620
Now I can sell these.

3561
03:14:26,140 --> 03:14:27,680
We can at least make a little bit of money.

3562
03:14:27,980 --> 03:14:30,580
I didn't make my money back, but you know.

3563
03:14:31,440 --> 03:14:32,180
What does she want?

3564
03:14:33,240 --> 03:14:34,520
You need help with anything?

3565
03:14:34,640 --> 03:14:35,600
Assistance from an angler?

3566
03:14:35,740 --> 03:14:36,100
Absolutely.

3567
03:14:36,380 --> 03:14:39,580
I've been trying to collect records of where each species of fish is located.

3568
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:44,740
Figured out most of them on my travels so far, but there are a few I haven't been able to track down.

3569
03:14:44,740 --> 03:14:46,400
Reckon you could share your info with me?

3570
03:14:46,460 --> 03:14:46,620
Sure!

3571
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:51,780
Oarfish, gulper eel, goliath, tigerfish, coelacanth.

3572
03:14:51,880 --> 03:14:52,360
Oh gosh.

3573
03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:54,960
OK.

3574
03:14:55,920 --> 03:14:59,660
I know a little about each species already, so maybe I can point you in the right direction.

3575
03:15:03,080 --> 03:15:05,000
I will ask about this later.

3576
03:15:05,920 --> 03:15:08,500
Because I'm gonna get out of this area, so we'll come back.

3577
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:13,140
Actually, maybe they might be in an area that...

3578
03:15:13,140 --> 03:15:14,980
Gale cliffs, OK.

3579
03:15:17,360 --> 03:15:20,220
Deepest depths imaginable, yes.

3580
03:15:20,400 --> 03:15:21,680
Specialist gear, OK.

3581
03:15:23,700 --> 03:15:26,920
Murky swampy waters, OK.

3582
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:34,490
Primordial field, OK.

3583
03:15:34,490 --> 03:15:34,650
OK.

3584
03:15:41,290 --> 03:15:43,210
It's a long quest.

3585
03:15:43,350 --> 03:15:45,010
Yeah, I could gather that.

3586
03:15:47,870 --> 03:15:48,290
Yeah.

3587
03:15:49,450 --> 03:15:50,210
So.

3588
03:15:51,770 --> 03:15:53,170
We're at the gale cliffs.

3589
03:15:56,730 --> 03:16:00,330
Twisted strand, devil's spine.

3590
03:16:00,410 --> 03:16:02,050
Everything else sounds terrifying.

3591
03:16:04,650 --> 03:16:10,850
I'm trying to pillage, but I'm dummy thick and the clap of my peg legs keeps alerting the scallywags.

3592
03:16:12,590 --> 03:16:13,230
Wait.

3593
03:16:14,910 --> 03:16:17,490
Let's try going to maybe...

3594
03:16:21,650 --> 03:16:22,670
Stellar basin.

3595
03:16:25,270 --> 03:16:26,230
For now.

3596
03:16:28,610 --> 03:16:32,530
I wanna upgrade things more before I go back into the scary cliffs.

3597
03:16:32,870 --> 03:16:34,570
They were so scary.

3598
03:16:37,530 --> 03:16:40,850
Stellar basin is to the west.

3599
03:16:48,300 --> 03:16:49,300
This...

3600
03:16:50,260 --> 03:16:51,400
This way!

3601
03:16:51,400 --> 03:16:51,680
Yay!

3602
03:17:02,960 --> 03:17:07,880
And we'll catch any fish we see along the way, perhaps.

3603
03:17:12,900 --> 03:17:15,840
We're sailing the ocean blue.

3604
03:17:16,780 --> 03:17:19,520
It's just me and you.

3605
03:17:20,860 --> 03:17:23,940
There's nothing to do.

3606
03:17:24,600 --> 03:17:29,720
So I'm just gonna keep singing through.

3607
03:17:33,500 --> 03:17:34,260
OK.

3608
03:17:39,480 --> 03:17:45,220
When it turns red it gets a little freaky, no?

3609
03:17:46,360 --> 03:17:47,840
Where are all the fish?

3610
03:17:48,680 --> 03:17:50,160
Where are all the fish at?

3611
03:17:52,720 --> 03:17:54,460
It's more like this way, no?

3612
03:17:56,040 --> 03:17:56,960
Wait.

3613
03:17:57,800 --> 03:17:58,780
Fish spotted!

3614
03:18:06,170 --> 03:18:07,550
Blue mackerel.

3615
03:18:08,730 --> 03:18:10,650
Such an average fish.

3616
03:18:15,420 --> 03:18:17,120
Am I going the right way?

3617
03:18:17,860 --> 03:18:18,180
No.

3618
03:18:19,060 --> 03:18:19,780
This way.

3619
03:18:21,620 --> 03:18:22,120
Yeah.

3620
03:18:22,760 --> 03:18:23,940
Past these islands.

3621
03:18:30,560 --> 03:18:33,440
Wish there were some tunes we could listen to.

3622
03:18:33,880 --> 03:18:35,060
It's awfully quiet.

3623
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:40,820
Where'd the music go?

3624
03:18:41,440 --> 03:18:44,560
I don't know, I think the game thinks that like we're...

3625
03:18:47,200 --> 03:18:50,160
We're in the spooky lands or something.

3626
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:09,100
Did I see a sparkly?

3627
03:19:09,360 --> 03:19:10,340
No, I don't think so.

3628
03:19:16,540 --> 03:19:17,180
Oh!

3629
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:18,920
There we go.

3630
03:19:23,130 --> 03:19:24,350
Looking around.

3631
03:19:28,530 --> 03:19:30,430
Is that a whole village?

3632
03:19:30,830 --> 03:19:34,270
Sorry, I know I keep checking the map.

3633
03:19:34,350 --> 03:19:35,530
I don't want to get lost.

3634
03:19:36,110 --> 03:19:36,730
I'm scared.

3635
03:19:39,130 --> 03:19:42,750
Keep dredging DLC where you fish up old records.

3636
03:19:45,190 --> 03:19:46,210
Wait, is that an actual thing?

3637
03:19:46,990 --> 03:19:48,170
Oh wait, uh oh.

3638
03:19:48,770 --> 03:19:50,410
It's time to get dark.

3639
03:19:57,490 --> 03:19:59,690
Can we make it to the dock?

3640
03:20:02,370 --> 03:20:03,630
On this side, right?

3641
03:20:04,250 --> 03:20:04,870
Yeah, yeah.

3642
03:20:10,990 --> 03:20:12,970
It's dark and I don't know where I'm at.

3643
03:20:13,110 --> 03:20:14,350
I'm lost and I'm scared.

3644
03:20:15,170 --> 03:20:16,850
Oh, there's jellyfish.

3645
03:20:17,390 --> 03:20:18,430
I'm guessing they're evil.

3646
03:20:18,430 --> 03:20:20,470
They're probably evil, right?

3647
03:20:20,610 --> 03:20:21,850
They're most likely evil.

3648
03:20:22,190 --> 03:20:23,470
A dock!

3649
03:20:24,950 --> 03:20:26,030
Are they coming for me?

3650
03:20:26,510 --> 03:20:28,370
I feel like something is coming for me.

3651
03:20:29,270 --> 03:20:30,490
Is something coming for me?

3652
03:20:31,410 --> 03:20:32,510
I can't tell.

3653
03:20:32,970 --> 03:20:33,890
This is a dock, right?

3654
03:20:34,310 --> 03:20:34,790
Ok, yeah.

3655
03:20:35,890 --> 03:20:37,850
Is that guy coming for me?

3656
03:20:40,370 --> 03:20:42,450
No, he's leaving me alone.

3657
03:20:43,550 --> 03:20:45,410
That's right, we got another message in the bottle.

3658
03:20:46,490 --> 03:20:47,970
It's so pretty, no?

3659
03:20:49,050 --> 03:20:52,350
What if we docked?

3660
03:20:53,250 --> 03:20:54,370
Alright, watch this.

3661
03:20:54,870 --> 03:20:56,250
We're gonna dock, it saves.

3662
03:20:56,610 --> 03:20:57,610
We're gonna undock.

3663
03:20:58,130 --> 03:21:02,510
If we die, it was worth it for the science.

3664
03:21:03,230 --> 03:21:05,410
Is that a tentacle or...

3665
03:21:10,540 --> 03:21:11,560
I think this...

3666
03:21:14,270 --> 03:21:16,260
See, it's fine.

3667
03:21:22,970 --> 03:21:24,470
Oh, what is that?

3668
03:21:24,850 --> 03:21:26,150
I don't have this.

3669
03:21:26,690 --> 03:21:28,450
I don't...

3670
03:21:29,750 --> 03:21:32,250
She's not gonna get mad if I go the long way.

3671
03:21:34,490 --> 03:21:35,390
Go further?

3672
03:21:36,030 --> 03:21:36,990
You want me to die?

3673
03:21:38,130 --> 03:21:39,590
I'm going the long way.

3674
03:21:41,290 --> 03:21:41,810
Probably.

3675
03:21:46,190 --> 03:21:48,010
I do kinda wanna see what a...

3676
03:21:48,930 --> 03:21:50,210
What a death is like.

3677
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:55,320
Can I dredge here?

3678
03:21:59,300 --> 03:22:00,720
Don't get me please.

3679
03:22:01,580 --> 03:22:02,520
Don't get me.

3680
03:22:03,180 --> 03:22:04,080
I got a ring.

3681
03:22:04,660 --> 03:22:05,940
That looks fancy!

3682
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:09,240
This side.

3683
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:12,520
Where's the spooky...

3684
03:22:13,400 --> 03:22:13,840
What was that?

3685
03:22:14,420 --> 03:22:14,900
I'm scared.

3686
03:22:15,420 --> 03:22:17,020
Mother base!

3687
03:22:19,280 --> 03:22:20,400
What's that sound?

3688
03:22:20,400 --> 03:22:20,460
I don't know.

3689
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:25,520
Where is...

3690
03:22:25,520 --> 03:22:26,840
The thing that we need to collect?

3691
03:22:27,080 --> 03:22:27,980
It's not in the middle, no?

3692
03:22:30,400 --> 03:22:33,080
I like that you can see the lighthouse even all the way from here.

3693
03:22:34,660 --> 03:22:35,680
You saved, right?

3694
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:38,400
I mean I did, yeah, but like...

3695
03:22:42,060 --> 03:22:44,280
You know stuff is messed up when...

3696
03:22:45,760 --> 03:22:47,020
When your lights go out.

3697
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:49,960
It was over here, no?

3698
03:22:54,380 --> 03:22:55,620
Research outpost.

3699
03:23:06,980 --> 03:23:08,780
I thought I saw it.

3700
03:23:13,410 --> 03:23:14,630
But it disappeared.

3701
03:23:19,560 --> 03:23:19,800
Oh!

3702
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:20,400
Hello.

3703
03:23:21,220 --> 03:23:21,860
You're here too?

3704
03:23:26,160 --> 03:23:28,320
I have a seven dollar fish.

3705
03:23:30,160 --> 03:23:32,320
It's the big red evil thing.

3706
03:23:32,740 --> 03:23:34,320
I know, but I didn't see it.

3707
03:23:34,740 --> 03:23:35,000
Did you?

3708
03:23:39,630 --> 03:23:40,150
Oh!

3709
03:23:43,530 --> 03:23:45,430
I saw it, but then...

3710
03:23:45,430 --> 03:23:47,930
I saw it like over here, but then it disappeared, no?

3711
03:23:50,310 --> 03:23:52,150
Is this thing still gonna get mad at me?

3712
03:23:53,650 --> 03:23:54,790
It's in the middle.

3713
03:23:56,450 --> 03:23:57,270
This thing?

3714
03:23:57,690 --> 03:23:58,290
No way.

3715
03:23:59,450 --> 03:23:59,730
Hello!

3716
03:24:00,510 --> 03:24:01,330
Excuse me.

3717
03:24:03,250 --> 03:24:04,490
Oh, you're angry now.

3718
03:24:07,230 --> 03:24:08,610
Hello, I'm here for...

3719
03:24:12,710 --> 03:24:15,390
I died.

3720
03:24:20,040 --> 03:24:22,320
How do I get...

3721
03:24:30,060 --> 03:24:32,130
These look like some interesting fish.

3722
03:24:38,670 --> 03:24:40,710
A barracuda.

3723
03:24:49,130 --> 03:24:50,750
I should've waited.

3724
03:24:53,870 --> 03:24:55,210
Barracuda.

3725
03:24:59,980 --> 03:25:01,460
This game is so fascinating.

3726
03:25:02,080 --> 03:25:03,860
I think I'm gonna call it here.

3727
03:25:03,980 --> 03:25:05,480
I'm starting to get a little sleepy.

3728
03:25:07,540 --> 03:25:09,340
I think I'll call it here.

3729
03:25:24,980 --> 03:25:25,780
RW Bladewing!

3730
03:25:25,880 --> 03:25:27,320
Thank you for the support!

3731
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:29,560
Finally caught a minstrel.

3732
03:25:29,660 --> 03:25:31,940
Also, people will tell you this is a fishing simulator.

3733
03:25:31,940 --> 03:25:34,320
But it's actually going to be a sleep simulator.

3734
03:25:35,240 --> 03:25:35,640
Yippee!

3735
03:25:35,940 --> 03:25:37,500
I can't wait to go to sleep.

3736
03:25:41,440 --> 03:25:43,260
Wait, so it really is the thing in the middle?

3737
03:25:45,740 --> 03:25:48,160
I wish that I could look around while I...

3738
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:49,200
while I boot.

3739
03:25:49,400 --> 03:25:50,000
You know what I mean?

3740
03:25:53,160 --> 03:25:54,060
Wait, is it this?

3741
03:25:56,500 --> 03:25:57,220
I'm dredging.

3742
03:25:58,420 --> 03:25:59,320
Ouch!

3743
03:25:59,580 --> 03:26:00,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

3744
03:26:00,680 --> 03:26:01,500
Hold on man!

3745
03:26:01,800 --> 03:26:02,280
Hold on!

3746
03:26:06,340 --> 03:26:07,240
Nevermind.

3747
03:26:09,060 --> 03:26:09,960
Spyglass!

3748
03:26:10,220 --> 03:26:11,060
Oh you're so smart.

3749
03:26:18,170 --> 03:26:19,530
Mysterious fish.

3750
03:26:20,490 --> 03:26:21,830
Mysterious fish.

3751
03:26:22,750 --> 03:26:23,550
Barracuda.

3752
03:26:24,630 --> 03:26:24,990
What's that?

3753
03:26:25,570 --> 03:26:27,670
Mysterious fish everywhere.

3754
03:26:28,500 --> 03:26:30,650
I can't get that.

3755
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:32,150
Wait.

3756
03:26:32,990 --> 03:26:34,190
Can't get that either.

3757
03:26:35,610 --> 03:26:36,470
I don't see it!

3758
03:26:39,810 --> 03:26:40,990
What's even over here?

3759
03:26:42,570 --> 03:26:45,050
Sorry, I know I said I was going to end, but I really like this game.

3760
03:26:46,590 --> 03:26:48,250
We're in the Stellar Basin.

3761
03:26:55,020 --> 03:26:57,960
We're looking for a ring in the Stellar Basin.

3762
03:26:59,320 --> 03:27:00,080
A ring.

3763
03:27:01,280 --> 03:27:01,960
A ring.

3764
03:27:03,560 --> 03:27:05,100
Different from that ring?

3765
03:27:06,240 --> 03:27:09,640
Is that the...that's not the ring I got before, is it?

3766
03:27:13,340 --> 03:27:15,660
Stellar, Stellar Basin.

3767
03:27:22,940 --> 03:27:23,960
Star Cries!

3768
03:27:24,380 --> 03:27:25,480
Thank you so much for the raid!

3769
03:27:25,560 --> 03:27:26,320
Thank you!

3770
03:27:30,670 --> 03:27:32,690
Maybe we attempt...

3771
03:27:33,690 --> 03:27:34,890
to get it.

3772
03:27:36,730 --> 03:27:37,790
That ring.

3773
03:27:47,420 --> 03:27:49,360
We attempt to get it, maybe.

3774
03:27:51,560 --> 03:27:53,380
Welcome, welcome raiders.

3775
03:27:54,940 --> 03:27:57,120
I'm playing Dredge and it's really fun.

3776
03:27:59,440 --> 03:28:00,640
We're pirating.

3777
03:28:02,060 --> 03:28:03,900
I don't think I'll get mad here, right?

3778
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:05,240
What's this?

3779
03:28:07,400 --> 03:28:09,240
This is also a ring.

3780
03:28:10,180 --> 03:28:10,920
Excuse me.

3781
03:28:11,900 --> 03:28:15,800
If I like, very chill, very...there we go.

3782
03:28:25,460 --> 03:28:25,900
Eeries!

3783
03:28:28,740 --> 03:28:29,180
No.

3784
03:28:31,260 --> 03:28:32,300
Is there a dog?

3785
03:28:38,350 --> 03:28:39,310
Like, is it that?

3786
03:28:39,430 --> 03:28:40,950
Oh gosh, is it the stuff in the middle?

3787
03:28:43,930 --> 03:28:45,930
I feel like it's gotta be in the middle.

3788
03:28:47,170 --> 03:28:47,610
No?

3789
03:28:47,950 --> 03:28:49,310
I feel like they would do that.

3790
03:28:54,410 --> 03:28:56,190
There it is!

3791
03:28:56,330 --> 03:28:56,550
Wait.

3792
03:28:58,150 --> 03:29:00,530
It's that, but we need the other...

3793
03:29:02,130 --> 03:29:03,490
I see it.

3794
03:29:05,270 --> 03:29:06,870
It is in the middle.

3795
03:29:09,210 --> 03:29:10,990
I saw it.

3796
03:29:14,730 --> 03:29:17,570
I didn't think you were lying, I just...

3797
03:29:18,310 --> 03:29:19,670
wanted to confirm.

3798
03:29:20,990 --> 03:29:25,590
You know, I just wanted to see with my own two eyes.

3799
03:29:25,930 --> 03:29:26,730
I will miss you.

3800
03:29:26,790 --> 03:29:27,670
I'm not going anywhere!

3801
03:29:31,950 --> 03:29:32,990
I'm staying.

3802
03:29:34,330 --> 03:29:35,010
What's this?

3803
03:29:35,910 --> 03:29:37,170
Okay, after this.

3804
03:29:38,350 --> 03:29:39,410
Strong explosives.

3805
03:29:39,630 --> 03:29:42,270
Okay, we need explosives for multiple things.

3806
03:29:43,410 --> 03:29:46,090
Okay, we have...oh my god.

3807
03:29:46,090 --> 03:29:48,890
I just...

3808
03:29:48,890 --> 03:29:50,690
I was up on it.

3809
03:29:51,870 --> 03:29:53,070
Up on my ship.

3810
03:29:53,630 --> 03:29:54,910
We're gonna...I'm gonna fish.

3811
03:29:58,550 --> 03:29:59,450
Coral group.

3812
03:29:59,570 --> 03:30:00,710
Oh, this thing is huge!

3813
03:30:04,670 --> 03:30:05,550
Here we go.

3814
03:30:07,250 --> 03:30:09,430
I'm gonna go sell this and then I'm done.

3815
03:30:09,670 --> 03:30:10,110
For real.

3816
03:30:11,190 --> 03:30:13,770
I will miss Minto when she ends stream.

3817
03:30:17,130 --> 03:30:17,610
Really?

3818
03:30:18,870 --> 03:30:19,350
Really?

3819
03:30:21,350 --> 03:30:25,050
I think I occupy enough of your thoughts that you don't miss me at all.

3820
03:30:34,990 --> 03:30:35,470
Maybe...

3821
03:30:52,360 --> 03:30:53,780
My hat grows.

3822
03:30:54,540 --> 03:30:55,840
My hat grows!

3823
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:56,880
Otsumito everybody!

3824
03:30:57,940 --> 03:31:00,880
Thank you for hanging out with me with the drudge!

3825
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:01,840
This is a lot of fun.

3826
03:31:02,180 --> 03:31:04,040
Oh my gosh, this game is so crazy!

3827
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:06,780
But I hope you had fun too!

3828
03:31:07,980 --> 03:31:08,940
I...honestly...okay, so...

3829
03:31:08,940 --> 03:31:10,220
Sorry, I didn't mean to get bigger.

3830
03:31:10,640 --> 03:31:11,080
Oops, sorry.

3831
03:31:11,220 --> 03:31:11,940
I didn't mean to get...sorry.

3832
03:31:12,140 --> 03:31:12,300
Oops.

3833
03:31:13,780 --> 03:31:15,320
Thank you Bearlet for the superchat.

3834
03:31:18,660 --> 03:31:19,140
I...

3835
03:31:20,560 --> 03:31:21,040
I...

3836
03:31:25,120 --> 03:31:25,600
I...I...

3837
03:31:27,100 --> 03:31:29,600
I was like, you know...

3838
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:32,780
This week I'm gonna choose two chill games.

3839
03:31:32,780 --> 03:31:36,060
Because I have three kind of stressful games.

3840
03:31:36,200 --> 03:31:38,780
With like DMC and Metal Gear and...

3841
03:31:40,320 --> 03:31:40,800
And...

3842
03:31:42,140 --> 03:31:42,620
Repo?

3843
03:31:42,760 --> 03:31:44,180
I think that's a stressful game.

3844
03:31:44,280 --> 03:31:45,560
I don't know anything about it.

3845
03:31:45,600 --> 03:31:47,340
I just know it's the hot stuff right now.

3846
03:31:49,320 --> 03:31:53,000
I haven't...I have purposefully not watched anything about it.

3847
03:31:53,420 --> 03:31:55,620
You're so obsessed with us you can't help but get closer, huh?

3848
03:31:55,740 --> 03:31:56,220
No!

3849
03:31:58,960 --> 03:32:00,640
It's lethal company but silly.

3850
03:32:00,760 --> 03:32:01,640
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

3851
03:32:03,680 --> 03:32:04,160
So...

3852
03:32:04,160 --> 03:32:07,080
But then I played Astro Bot and that's...

3853
03:32:07,080 --> 03:32:10,740
I thought that was gonna be really chill but the levels ended up being so difficult.

3854
03:32:11,060 --> 03:32:14,020
I thought they were gonna be easy peasy levels but they were so hard.

3855
03:32:14,340 --> 03:32:15,880
And then this game also scared me.

3856
03:32:16,360 --> 03:32:19,480
I don't think I chose a single chill game at all this week.

3857
03:32:20,440 --> 03:32:21,980
Actually, no, this was pretty chill.

3858
03:32:22,280 --> 03:32:23,400
I'm happy about it.

3859
03:32:25,360 --> 03:32:26,700
I'm happy about it.

3860
03:32:26,920 --> 03:32:27,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3861
03:32:27,320 --> 03:32:32,220
But Otsumito everybody, thank you for hanging out with me.

3862
03:32:33,360 --> 03:32:39,540
And I'll see you guys when I see you next time.

3863
03:32:39,560 --> 03:32:40,900
Thanks for the five gifted!

3864
03:32:41,280 --> 03:32:42,140
Fushigi Sunday.

3865
03:32:42,940 --> 03:32:44,240
Oh yeah, that will be pretty chill.

3866
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:46,120
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

3867
03:32:46,240 --> 03:32:47,720
Actually I have to post something about that.

3868
03:32:50,760 --> 03:32:52,400
I have to post something about that.

3869
03:32:54,300 --> 03:32:54,700
OK!

3870
03:32:55,280 --> 03:32:56,480
Otsumito itterasshai!

3871
03:32:56,620 --> 03:32:57,840
Everybody have a good day, have a good night.

3872
03:32:58,080 --> 03:32:59,640
And I'll see you later!

3873
03:33:00,260 --> 03:33:01,800
Thank you so much for the feed!

3874
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:03,920
Thank you, thank you.

3875
03:33:04,440 --> 03:33:05,280
Bye bye!
