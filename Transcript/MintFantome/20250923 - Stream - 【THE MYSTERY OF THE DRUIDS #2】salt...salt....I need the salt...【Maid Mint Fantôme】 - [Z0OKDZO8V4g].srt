You're not asking about a fishing rod, are you?

8
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,160
I...

9
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,260
It must have been that darn cat knocked it into the water!

10
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,340
Which I also...

11
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,260
Wait, I don't have the cat in the blanket anymore.

12
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:36,880
Okay.

13
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,800
Sorry.

14
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,360
I wanted to give a little bit of a recap.

15
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,020
Because, you know.

16
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,000
So much happened.

17
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,900
Last time.

18
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
Welcome back, everybody, to the Mr. of the druids.

19
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,340
So happy to be here.

20
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,980
Hope one day we get a 3D Minto on a gaming stream.

21
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,780
Hopefully one day.

22
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,020
Yes, we're in France now.

23
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,380
France.

24
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:15,200
And everybody was very adamant that I needed to get salt before I left the screen or else the game would be softlocked.

25
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,760
But we are gamers.

26
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,180
and we avoided Colonel.

27
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,600
We managed to avoid salt locking.

28
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,140
So, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

29
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:43,660
Um, I, I, okay, so this game is about a weird detective and we got this case from another guy that was fired because he thought it was the butcher, but it was not the butcher.

30
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:54,700
And now we learned that maybe It was an ancient ritual because of some gold and a sickle or something.

31
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,880
Good luck on Druids, thank you!

32
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,600
Don't forget to get peppermintky, it tastes great!

33
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,960
Lowry wasn't fired.

34
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,600
He was fired from the case.

35
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,060
He was taken off the case.

36
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,660
Sorry, that's why I knew he wasn't fired as a police officer.

37
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,920
He was taken off the case.

38
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,760
And, yeah, we also lost our wallet and we maybe poisoned a man.

39
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,360
And now we're in France for some reason.

40
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm headed out on a very long road trip tomorrow.

41
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,300
Oh my goodness.

42
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,840
Vanilla, good luck.

43
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,840
I'll probably be watching your 3D live from a tent in rural North Dakota.

44
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,760
It's my first big road trip after health.

45
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,260
of stuff.

46
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Whoa!

47
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,820
Have fun!

48
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
Have fun, have fun.

49
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,920
That's been a while, but my birthday was August 4th.

50
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,960
Wow, it was a... Happy belated birthday, RoboCorps.

51
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,840
But yeah, we're here.

52
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,340
We're gonna go check out a castle.

53
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,980
I want to get a lot done today, so let's just get into it.

54
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,420
Run.

55
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,440
Run, Halagin, run.

56
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,580
Run!

57
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,460
Run!

58
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,680
Run!

59
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,500
So we need to go to How do you pronounce this?

60
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,660
Shlob!

61
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,100
Yes.

62
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,500
How mysterious.

63
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,700
Looks like this used to be a tower.

64
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,320
But it's collapsed.

65
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,820
Used to be a tower, but the way he runs.

66
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,820
He's so tiny.

67
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,000
No, go inside.

68
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,100
Go inside.

69
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:38,800
Go inside.

70
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,760
Shloss.

71
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,860
Ah.

72
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
Thank you.

73
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,400
What's in here?

74
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,420
Something.

75
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,740
Now we can explore.

76
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,820
The music lasted literally two seconds.

77
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:56,960
That's fine.

78
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay.

79
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,900
Is there anything for me to click on?

80
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,740
Nothing.

81
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,200
I can observe.

82
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,440
And that's it?

83
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,700
You're up soon.

84
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,360
Min's next magic trick.

85
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,720
Watch her play this game and make her sanity disappear.

86
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,620
Nothing here.

87
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,040
Oh, that's a castle.

88
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,220
Eh.

89
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah?

90
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,520
Is there anything else?

91
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,580
Around here?

92
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,340
What?

93
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,810
Looks like this used to be a tower, but it's collapsed.

94
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,490
Wait, is this literally all that's it?

95
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,870
Wait, no way.

96
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,070
Why am I here?

97
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,410
Wait.

98
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,210
Why?

99
00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:17,510

100
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,510
Colombo.

101
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,410
Oh, okay.

102
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,690
We can go down here.

103
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,330
Can we go over here?

104
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,090
Oh, what's this?

105
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,010
A tower.

106
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,050
This castle must have been a real fortress before it collapsed.

107
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:37,990
A tower.

108
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,410
Oh, so many towers.

109
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,030
This castle must have been a real fortress before it collapsed.

110
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,430
Okay.

111
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,790
Downstairs.

112
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,110
Boss area, but you're too early.

113
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,330
Oh, we're here.

114
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,650
We're here.

115
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,690
What is this?

116
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:50,690
Okay.

117
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,090
It's not locked, is it?

118
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:52,770
Locked.

119
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,310
It's locked.

120
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,410
Oh, sorry.

121
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,730
It's locked.

122
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,330
Oh, no.

123
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,630
The gate is locked.

124
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,430
An iron gate.

125
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,450
Locked.

126
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,970
Oh.

127
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,030
Anybody that can get me in?

128
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,190
Find a key.

129
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:12,430
Oh.

130
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,290
This looks so suspicious.

131
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,030
No, this like little rock on the ground.

132
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,590
Okay.

133
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,690
If I were...

134
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:26,870
I would be under a rock if I were a key to a place.

135
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,410
I'd be under a rock.

136
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,130
Locked.

137
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,990
Locked.

138
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,830
Locked.

139
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:36,730
Locked.

140
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,850
Maybe in here now.

141
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,190
That's where they're hiding it.

142
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,870
A ghost!

143
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,750
Oh, it's a cute one.

144
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:47,490
Meow.

145
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,690
No, I'm actually quite spooky and scary.

146
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,150
Thank you.

147
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,830
Why are they...

148
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,030
music disappear.

149
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,310
Okay.

150
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,970
It's going to be the tiniest thing.

151
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,690
The tiniest little thing.

152
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,730
It's in the tree.

153
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,030
It's not.

154
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,070
It's in the tower.

155
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,370
It's not.

156
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,370
It's so quiet.

157
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:50,130
anonymous agony playthrough for the birthday stream or maybe pathologic i think birthday stream will just be a little more chill uh watch out for the droods i'm watching notice you love frumpy don't call the frumpy middle-aged bed

158
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,500
unless you're like wanting to feel better about yourself.

159
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,340
Oh, Minto loves grumpy middle-aged men, so when I inevitably become one, it'll be okay.

160
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,640
I ordered an apple cider at the maid cafe, but as soon as I drank it, it passed out of work without my spare change, Missy.

161
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,620
Ah, Missy, your wallet?

162
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,260
Looks like this used to be a tower, but it's collapsed.

163
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,500
I don't...

164
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,120
No.

165
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,300
Okay, wait.

166
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,260
Okay, let's go back.

167
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,520
Okay, what did we get the salt for?

168
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,420
Everybody said I needed it.

169
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,160
But I also have no...

170
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,600
What is it?

171
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,240
Is it going to, like, erode the lock or some stupid baloney?

172
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,240
Okay, let's try it.

173
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,200
Let's try our items on this.

174
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,120
Locked.

175
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,620
It's locked.

176
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
It's locked.

177
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,120
Is this the salt?

178
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,080
That's futile as well.

179
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,200
It's futile.

180
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,100
Worse than that!

181
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,500
Are we going to...

182
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,320
Are we gonna use it for like some food?

183
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,200
It's the one of the dumbest puzzle solutions in the game.

184
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,180
You technically already have the key in your inventory.

185
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,720
How it works just doesn't make sense.

186
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Oh, okay, so it was something in my inventory.

187
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,280
Is it this?

188
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,800
No, better not.

189
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,280
No.

190
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,180
Is it the bone?

191
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,840
I should think about it again.

192
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,300
No.

193
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,500
Is it...

194
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,580
Uh...

195
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,340
I have it?

196
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,220
In my inventory?

197
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,500
Is it...

198
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,140
Is it the blanket?

199
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,880
It won't work like that.

200
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,540
Just go in.

201
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,500
I can't.

202
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,420
The gloves.

203
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,980
That won't get me any further.

204
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:37,760
Okay.

205
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,920
I have to talk to the captain first.

206
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,600
Nothing I have here.

207
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,920
I feel works.

208
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,190
I thought the salt made sense.

209
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,810
Okay.

210
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,150
Okay,

211
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,610
back to here.

212
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,930
Hello, Capitan.

213
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:09,890
Capitan.

214
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,070
Help me.

215
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,130
I've just started the game and I'm lost.

216
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,890
Missila, Capitan.

217
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,350
What can I do for you?

218
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,110
Um, I've got a few more questions.

219
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,430
What was our last conversation?

220
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,010
I've got a few more questions concerning our last conversation.

221
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,670
Good morning, Marty.

222
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,770

You were in all those places.

226
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:01,910
Wow.

227
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,390
And that's not all.

228
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,450
I have seen tsunamis 40 meters high and octopuses with 16 tentacles.

229
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:10,910
What?

230
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,130
I thought octopuses only had 8 tentacles.

231
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,430
Quite, my boy.

232
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:14,930
Quite.

233
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,010
I have seen things a common land lover.

234
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,090
No offense, my boy.

235
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,350
Cannot even begin to imagine.

236
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,050
No offense.

237
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,210
Octopuses with twice the normal.

238
00:18:25,230 --> 00:19:35,090
number of tentacles I do have the item well that's quite incredible but I still do I kind of want to hear stories though of course my logs are full of them take the story of Nantucket Island for instance I was stranded there for a number of years would you like to hear it is a long story like I said I spent a number of years there some other time maybe I'm sorry years how can you have wait you fast-tracked to poisoning a guy so you missed how against co-workers not helping you wait what thank you thank you Masula Capitan you've been a great help you're welcome my boy oh my gosh I'm glad your plushies finally came I know that there's been a bit of a delay on a lot of the second batch so thank you guys for your patience okay so we go back

239
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:56,800
okay let's go down okay I didn't try everything in my inventory we'll try more it's locked

240
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,560
evidence bag we're brute forcing it I don't believe it will work like that are you sure?

241
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,240
um cider that doesn't work okay It doesn't work.

242
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,300
The matches.

243
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,640
We light the place on fire.

244
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
That's futile as well.

245
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,640
No, just kidding.

246
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,520
Okay, clipboard.

247
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,360
Not a good idea.

248
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,220
Oh, I thought it was a fine idea.

249
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,620
What is this?

250
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,000
That won't help either.

251
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,680
It won't help.

252
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,700
Cider on the gate.

253
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,920
It'll dissolve it because it's so alcoholic.

254
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,280
Looks like that won't work.

255
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,540
No, okay.

256
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,560
This?

257
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,440
That would be stupid.

258
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,980
Oh, rude.

259
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:34,880
What about you?

260
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,620
I don't believe it will work like that.

261
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,360
Okay, and this.

262
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,460
Oh, the case file!

263
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,440
Oh, right.

264
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,560
No, stink it.

265
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,220
How is anybody supposed to know?

266
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,780
He's supposed to know.

267
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,680
Sorry, guys.

268
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,100
Weeks.

269
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,220
Weeks of playthrough value.

270
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,920
Oh, my God.

271
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,100
Wow.

272
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,220
We.

273
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,600
Okay.

274
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:19,860
Okay.

275
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,260
What do we got here?

276
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,280
What a fine, Ooh, Cemetery.

277
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:26,780
Yes?

278
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,700
A gravestone.

279
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,300
Pretty weather-beaten.

280
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,400
What is special about this one that you chose to look at this one?

281
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,640
There's a hollow in the top.

282
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,080
A gravestone.

283
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Hollow?

284
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:36,980
Oh, here?

285
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,700
Pretty weather-beaten.

286
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,680
There's a hollow at the top.

287
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,280
Okay.

288
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,680
There's a hollow at the top.

289
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,160
Okay.

290
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,760
Do I put some, oh, what is, is that an owl?

291
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,220
Oh, wow.

292
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,960
Wait, so what can I put here?

293
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,600
Maybe the cider.

294
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,920
That won't get me any.

295
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
I should think up something else.

296
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:55,780
Lang.

297
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,340
Uh, this one.

298
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,780
I should think about it.

299
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,540
Not a good idea.

300
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,160
Just kidding.

301
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,820
Uh.

302
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,560
Uh, the salt.

303
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,180
Oh!

304
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,500
Huh?

305
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,260
Oh, wait.

306
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,220
What?

307
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,280
A gravestone.

308
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,860
Pretty weather-beaten.

309
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,760
What did it do?

310
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,960
How beat it?

311
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,680
Minty Minto says wowie.

312
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,340
Why?

313
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Did I say wowie?

314
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,520
Beep, beep.

315
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,840
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

316
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,200
Wait, why did I do that?

317
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,680
There's a holout, a gravestone.

318
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,380
There's a holout.

319
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,740
Yeah, I did it.

320
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,000
Maybe there's another one.

321
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,100
Wait, what do I...

322
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,040
Why did I do that?

323
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
Why did I do that?

324
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,860
Okay, let's go this way.

325
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,360
Or...

326
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,240
Oh, wait, never mind.

327
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,040
This way first.

328
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,300
The way he turned around.

329
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,160
Oh, I wish the music would come back.

330
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,820
I do wish the...

331
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:57,920
Oh.

332
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,580
Wait, this one too!

333
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,380
Gravestone.

334
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,020
Pretty weather-beaten.

335
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,560
There's a hollow at the top.

336
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,600
Okay.

337
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,380
Do we have to find the correct one?

338
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,520
We're salting our gravestones for dinner.

339
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,740
Oh.

340
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,920
Sake blue.

341
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:23,820
Dade!

342
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,800
French, French, French and Japanese.

343
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,000
Whoa, little monkey.

344
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,420
It looks like...

345
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,280
Wait, does this one...

346
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,060
Wait, do these also?

347
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:40,920
Oh!

348
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,480
A gravest as a hollow at the top.

349
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,020
Okay.

350
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,880
This one also?

351
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,820
Gravest as a hollow at the top.

352
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,900
Okay, I gotta go get my salt back.

353
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,140
Okay.

354
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,620
Wait, this place is huge.

355
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Where'd that guy go?

356
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,080
Okay, let's go here.

357
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,060
Who else salt in their grave?

358
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah, I have to be careful with the salt because I will get exercised.

359
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,140
And today I'm feeling lazy.

360
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,540
Let's go get my salt before I do anything else.

361
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,640
Okay.

362
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:29,370
You probably need to find a medium rare naked it serves this is hockey okay let's grab my grab that thank you very much okay bye-bye

363
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:49,230
hmm who was that though that guy it looked like ricky martin in a tight black shirt um well wait oh wait let's go this way first

364
00:24:52,290 --> 00:25:01,230
oh my gosh this place is humongous why are there so many graves that What?

365
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,330
A grave...

366
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,450
There's a hollow at the top.

367
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,690
They all have a hollow at the top.

368
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,030
What's your favorite gravestone topping?

369
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:12,850
Salt!

370
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,630
A grave...

371
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,070
I love salt on a gravestone.

372
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:24,970
This really makes it nice and easy to lick.

373
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,530
It's like creating your own salt lick, you know?

374
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,590
Okay, so let's go this way.

375
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,450
Salt.

376
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,670
This place is huge.

377
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,790
Huge!

378
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,350
Oh, they all say the same thing!

379
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,990
Oh my gosh!

380
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,470
A great as a Hollywood.

381
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:05,890
What?

382
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,500
It looks like...

383
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,780
The door's walled up.

384
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,100
It looks like a kid's sandcastle.

385
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,740
If you think that's bad, one point and click gives you pie.

386
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,880
You can eat at any time or give away to...

387
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,020
And many times to others, you actually need to save it until the end of the game to throw it in the Yeti's face.

388
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,000
Replayability.

389
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,240
The door's walled up.

390
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,220
A mausoleum.

391
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,820
I expect the lord of the castle's buried in there.

392
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,300
Wow.

393
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,520
It's gigantic.

394
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:40,900
Yeah.

395
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,380
Yeah.

396
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,360
A mausoleum is practically a castle itself.

397
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,780
A mausoleum.

398
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,940
A mausoleum.

399
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,400
Okay, we can go this way.

400
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,660
This place...

401
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,260
Where am I?

402
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,220
Oh, okay.

403
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,420
Okay, so now we have like 50 gravestones that all...

404
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,780
What?

405
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,980
Oh, I see it in the back now.

406
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,460
Okay.

407
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,380
But where did that guy go?

408
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,940
That guy was a real ghost, huh?

409
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:27,580
the captain knows what to do I do have to talk to the captain okay thank you so much let's go talk to him Mr. Mr. What do I use the song for?

410
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:46,520

411
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:57,300

414
00:28:44,120 --> 00:29:01,800

415
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:46,210

416
00:29:54,400 --> 00:31:07,100
you talk to him tell you about the druids and the salt so do I ask what's the line of think okay let's do the merchant Navy then maybe you used to work for the merchant Navy yes I have been to practically every single port all over the world from New York to Zanzibar from Rotterdam to Cape Town I have sailed all known and unknown oceans rivers backwaters lakes and canals I have seen things no other man on earth has ever seen sounds exciting yes but all that was a long time ago i'm gonna okay uh maybe this one we didn't do and now you only captain the ferry from carmore to portsmouth yes that's right is there anything wrong with that don't you like talking to only captain ferries it's an important job people need ferries because it just so happens there's a lot of water between the islands and the continent and somebody has to steer those ferries but i don't suppose a land lover like you would understand that i didn't mean to offend you captain that's monsieur le capitan charles de

417
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:21,040
neuve to you my boy you'd better get a bit dry behind the ears before you start talking to season sailors got that yes sir i should think so too oops oh well thanks for

419
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,900
Ask about the memoirs.

420
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,070
Okay.

421
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,840
You can probably proceed with the salt in the grave now.

422
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,460
Wait, really?

423
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,480
Wait, but I don't know what to do.

424
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,500
Wait.

425
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,740
Huh?

426
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,100
Do I need salt for...

427
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,420
Huh?

428
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,020
What?

429
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,270
I think you got one guide.

430
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:29,950
Oh!

431
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,050
Okay.

432
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:45,750
hold on keep going what can you do with salt in a bowl lick it

433
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,520
maybe i'm maybe i need like a maybe i need salt all i think about is licking salt

434
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:15,040
oh let's see let's find a grave that works If any of these work, I can't imagine I have to go put, like, the salt on every single grave, you know what I mean?

435
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,220
So let's try one.

436
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,140
Let's try, okay, let's do this.

437
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,520
All right, let's put the salt on, and then maybe, towel it.

438
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,080
That won't help either.

439
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:25,500
Okay.

440
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,440
Bone it!

441
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,420
Oh!

442
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,200
Oh!

443
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,620
Oh!

444
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,540
Now I have more salt.

445
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,540
There's no point in that.

446
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,800
Huh?

447
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,790
What?

448
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,230
That didn't answer my question.

449
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:59,750
I love how the game is also so like, if you're stuck, if you're having trouble, just think about your objective.

450
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:05,530
And me, I'm kind of like, what is it?

451
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,690
They make you feel like you're dumb whenever.

452
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,590
Everything is so obtuse.

453
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,130
You know?

454
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,350
Was there...

455
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,750
Okay, this has to feel like...

456
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,250
I feel like this has to be something.

457
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,050
The door's walled up.

458
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,410
Okay, do you need a salt?

459
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,090
Yeah!

460
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,990
No way.

461
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:28,870
No way.

462
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,190
No way?

463
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,090
Wait, no way as in like, no way this will work.

464
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,210
Looks like that won't work.

465
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,750
Okay.

466
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,690
Things are answering my questions.

467
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:50,710
question he keeps fading in and out of existence oh we lost him there he is

468
00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:13,390
oh okay the wall that's what i tried no i expect the lord of the doors walled up the doors walled up it didn't work though hold on that doesn't work it doesn't work Maybe the walls.

469
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,230
The walls walled up.

470
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,670
No, no way.

471
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:17,530
Oh, what?

472
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:21,610
What?

473
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,170
It seems to have worked.

474
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,100
Oh, we got the amulet.

475
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,560
This must be the amulet.

476
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,040
I found it.

477
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,700
This is what will cause.

478
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,120
Wait, this is what will prevent.

479
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,740
Oh, my gosh.

480
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,120
The druids don't know what salt is.

481
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,900
They've never seasoned their steaks.

482
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,440
What the

483
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,050
hell?

484
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,630
How?

485
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:18,370
So, now we have the amulet, this will prevent them from doing their ritual that will destroy the world!

486
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,370
And the babies!

487
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,590
Wait, what if that guy in the black shirt, what if Ricky Martin was one of the guys?

488
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,810
Don't worry, Halligan didn't know how that worked either.

489
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,230
Okay, so now we can leave.

490
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,510
I guess.

491
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,270
Who are you?

492
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,550
Run!

493
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,730
Run, Hologan, run!

494
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,570
Huh.

495
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,070
Mysterious man.

496
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,430
So I'm guessing we can, like, leave the port now, right?

497
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,030
Do you believe me if I told you the game gets dumber?

498
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,390
Wait, what?

499
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,370
Druids have seasoned their stakes before there were no survivors.

500
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,370
Ah, I see, I see.

501
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,450
Is there a spammer?

502
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,930
I don't see it on my side.

503
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,050
Oh wait, yes I do.

504
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,230
Please no spam!

505
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,310
Maybe I should stop salting my food so much.

506
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,170
Okay, sorry about that.

507
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:27,970
I didn't see it.

508
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,190
Okay.

509
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:29,630
Onwards!

510
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,660
We got the amulet.

511
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,920
Let's go back to maybe our guy.

512
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,700
Oh, um...

513
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,740
Talk to him about- I hope the guy is not dead.

514
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,100
You know?

515
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,800
At least it was a nice spammer.

516
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,320
They were nice, yeah.

517
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,780
Saying I was, saying I was cute.

518
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Monsieur Le Capitan.

519
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,480
What can I do for you?

520
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
When are you leaving?

521
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,460
When are you leaving for Portsmouth?

522
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,300
In two hours.

523
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,480
Are you coming?

524
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,580
Yes.

525
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,880
Then come aboard.

526
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,960
Oh, oh, oh.

527
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Wow, my room.

528
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,860
I have to sit on board for two hours.

529
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,060
Wow, they give me so close.

530
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,880
I don't think I need to change my clothes just yet.

531
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,540
Clothes and stuff.

532
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,680
I don't...

533
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,760
Clothes and stuff.

534
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,240
Clothes and stuff.

535
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
Clothes and stuff.

536
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,660
Clothes and stuff.

537
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,640
That's my hold all.

538
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,380
A what?

539
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,460
It's too early to pack.

540
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,840
We won't be arriving yet.

541
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,720
A hold all?

542
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,780
That's my hold all.

543
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,120
Wow, that's what British people call a bag.

544
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,200
My spare suit.

545
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,460
Just in case.

546
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,000
Mm-hmm.

547
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,680
Okay.

548
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,920
Clothes and stuff.

549
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,660
Clothes and stuff.

550
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,240
Clothes and stuff.

551
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:05,400
I'm going to call, I'm going to say that to Limeu next time and be like, Oh, Limeu, today I went to the department store and I got Hodo.

552
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,600
I'm Carl McRug-Angie.

553
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,840
Neal-Minky voice make happy.

554
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,680
Hello.

555
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,620
That's the sea out there.

556
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,100
No kidding.

557
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,560
The sea.

558
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:50,640
what do we take a nap i'm not tired just kidding a bunk rather spartan wow though wait how long of a ride is it that we get a whole room hold on i think i'd better leave the amulet in the cabin i don't lose it otherwise no or it might be stolen i think it might be stolen on the ship in the room you went all the way to france and all you did was steal a fishing rod and blew up a castle with salt maybe in here this is like the least no Hmm.

559
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,680
It's empty.

560
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Okay.

561
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,380
Don't put it in there, though.

562
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,500
You wouldn't be so dumb.

563
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,360
Okay, good.

564
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,680
Well, put it in my spare coat pocket.

565
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:05,920
Oh, whoops.

566
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,820
Wrong button.

567
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,280
I don't want that.

568
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:08,840
Just kidding.

569
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,760
I can't do that.

570
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,040
That won't help either.

571
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,880
No, not a chance.

572
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,660
Not a good idea.

573
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,040
Oh, wait.

574
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,940
I can't see any connection there.

575
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:15,780
Okay.

576
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,540
Hmm.

577
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,920
Let's hide it under my pillow.

578
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,760
for the druid fairy.

579
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:23,840
Wait.

580
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,560
It won't work like that.

581
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,540
Okay, I thought it was about to work.

582
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,540
Pizza.

583
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,700
What part of England is the accent from Minto?

584
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,390
Truffle bottom.

585
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,660
Okay, we could throw it out the window.

586
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,560
Hmm.

587
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,900
Nothing's happening.

588
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,380
Okay.

589
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Uh...

590
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,940
Where can I hold...

591
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Where can I hide this?

592
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,210
Uh, in the bed?

593
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,310
It won't work like that.

594
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,730
No, in my pocket then.

595
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,390
There it goes, in the pocket.

596
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,610
Hide it in the pocket.

597
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:22,950
What?

598
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,680
Hmm.

599
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,760
Back in here?

600
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,060
Hmm.

601
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,520
That doesn't work.

602
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,180
Really?

603
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,760
What about my shoes?

604
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,100
No?

605
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,480
I should think up something else.

606
00:41:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
time to pixel hunt there's no point in that oh my goodness i think i tried everything in here let me just double check this the clothes and stuff i don't want that i don't want that won't get me any further okay the duffel bag it's not that it's not the duffel bag not a good idea that's futile as well think first brent oh my god no way it won't work like that won't get me in no way no way uh-huh if i were a halogen and i'm trying to hide an amulet from an evil cult where would i hide it in the room where would i hide it in the room open the drawer first i don't think it works like that hmm it's empty yeah see he closes it And then it won't let me select it again with the amulet.

607
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:53,380
If I were a guy, if I were a peculiar man who had very...

608
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,720
A light, no?

609
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,320
Under the bed?

610
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,360
It won't work like that.

611
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,300
Top right vent, it doesn't...

612
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,860
No, wait, no.

613
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,500
That won't help either.

614
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,200
Okay, okay.

615
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,200
Off-colored vent panel.

616
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,800
Nope, it was not that...

617
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,060
Oh!

618
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
I'd rather think about it again.

619
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,420
I'd rather think about it again.

620
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,300
What?

621
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,600
But that feels like it...

622
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,700
Then why...

623
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,260
Let me...

624
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,460
Eh?

625
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,360
You'll have to open it first.

626
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:35,780
Ah!

627
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,950
Sorry, I've been really sneezing today.

628
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,010
There we go!

629
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,870
Ah!

630
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,190
Ah!

631
00:43:45,670 --> 00:44:02,070
I see I see okay yeah perfect hiding place for the amulet no one will find it there right I think I'll go and get some fresh air I'm feeling a bit breezy you cut him

632
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:17,450
off God what's been going on here someone's broken into my cabin and searched through all my things oh who would have thought this would happen No, not like that.

633
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,270
What's this?

634
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,070
I think they're fur needles.

635
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,190
Fur needles.

636
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,870
Whoever did this made a thorough job of it.

637
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,130
Whoever did this made a thorough job of it.

638
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,790
Whoever did this made a thorough job of it.

639
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,610
My bed!

640
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,210
Whoever did this made...

641
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,070
Whoever did this made a thorough job of it.

642
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,330
You think they made a thorough job of it, you guys?

643
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:39,710
No!

644
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:40,410
My suit!

645
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,510
Whoever did this made a thorough job.

646
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,410
Whoever did this...

647
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,510
Whoever did this made a thorough job of it.

648
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,990
Whoever did this made a thorough job of it.

649
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:49,590
Okay, okay.

650
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,630
The amulet.

651
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,490
Where's the amulet?

652
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,410
It's been stolen.

653
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,590
I don't believe it.

654
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,950
I don't believe it.

655
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,110
I cannot believe it.

656
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:00,570
Last it.

657
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,170
The thief must still be on board.

658
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,690
But we're pulling into the harbor.

659
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,110
I'll never catch him now.

660
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,250
Walks away with no sense of urgency at all.

661
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:12,830
Uh-oh.

662
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,750
On the...

663
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:37,020
let's go talk to this guy and see maybe is he still alive maybe please be alive Blake

664
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:47,570
I sound extra cute today hello mr.

665
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:56,190
Blake I'm back and did you find the amulet that's a long story mr.

666
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:31,230
it's pretty bad we'll go on then I can't wait to hear what happened I found the amulet it was walled up in the Lord's William really it really does exist then and you've got it show me well I did have it but it was stolen from me stolen how did that happen no idea I hid it in my cabin during the crossing someone broke in and rummaged through all my luggage was anything else missing no not a thing someone must have been following you I didn't notice anyone.

667
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,970
Who could have known I'd be looking for an amulet and a God-forsaken dump.

668
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:39,190
Certain people may be taking a great interest in your investigations, Mr. Holligan.

669
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,030
Do not underestimate the power of the druids.

670
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,410
Oh,

671
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,450
oh, I don't know.

672
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,530
Perhaps it was just a case of ordinary petty theft.

673
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,570
I haven't met anyone who looks like a druid so far.

674
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,190
Are you saying the druids stole the amulet?

675
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,350
That's absurd.

676
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,770
Well, I really haven't met anyone, though.

677
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,810
a druid.

678
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,530
I haven't met anyone who looked like a druid so far.

679
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,670
No, no, Mr. Halligan.

680
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,410
You won't recognize the inheritors by their cloaks and sickles.

681
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,890
They're people, just like you and me.

682
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:18,610
They could be powerful industrialists, high-ranking politicians or influential military men, people in key positions of society.

683
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:19,810
What can I do then?

684
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:25,090
I can't possibly check up on the entire upper class of British society, looking for a couple of druids.

685
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:25,770
No.

686
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,750
But it may be worth your while to keep an eye on groups of neo Druids.

687
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:35,490
If anyone tries to justify their claims to the Druids' inheritance, they will.

688
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,510
Neo... The Matrix Druids?

689
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:42,410
Neo Druids?

690
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:43,250
What are they?

691
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:48,130
There are a number of groups around claiming to be the Druids' rival successors.

692
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,630
They're organized in orders, like Templars or Freemasons.

693
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,970
Tell me more.

694
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,210
Tell me more about these Neo Druids.

695
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:03,010
Like I said, the Neo Druids try to their lives according to ancient druid ideals.

696
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,730
Some of them do a lot of charitable work as well.

697
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:13,090
But there are some really dubious associations going around, combining the druid's customs with occult rites.

698
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,750
Rumors say that they're such a sect at large, somewhere in London.

699
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:19,850
In London?

700
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,790
In London, you said.

701
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,170
Do you know where I might find these people?

702
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:25,210
I have no idea.

703
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:30,950
All I know is that the only people who know anything about the Order refer to it as The circle.

704
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,150
The circle.

705
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:33,870
Oh, okay.

706
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,370
Thank you.

707
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:34,870
Thank you, Mr. Blake.

708
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,290
I'll see what I can make of it.

709
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,810
If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to call on me.

710
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:41,830
Anytime you like.

711
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:42,830
Thank you.

712
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,010
Oh.

713
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,610
Oh, wiggles.

714
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,610
Oh, one more thing, Mr. Blake.

715
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,150
Oh my gosh.

716
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:50,950
Uh-oh.

717
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,150
This means Mr. Blake is the criminal.

718
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,430
One more thing, Mr. Blake.

719
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:55,030
Yes.

720
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,390
I get the impression this business could get pretty dangerous from now on.

721
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,170
Yes.

722
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,110
likely mr.

723
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:19,510
Halligan it may be safer for both of us if we let someone else in on the matter please call Melanie Turner in Oxford and tell her the whole story make sure she learns everything you've told me she works at the Anthropological Museum her numbers in the phone book and tell her I'll get in touch with her myself as soon as possible kind of crazy would you do that for me of course mr.

724
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:24,070
Halligan yeah her numbers you can find it numbers in the phone book no

725
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:38,910
biggie is my favorite song in the whole game so far i'm expecting to see ricky martin and like out of the corner of our eye and every scene now

726
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:57,910
um okay we probably don't need to go talking to her if he's calling her uh maybe we go to the scotland yard and we researched the circle.

727
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:58,290
Halligan?

728
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,110
Into my office at once.

729
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:00,810
Uh-oh.

730
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,270
That doesn't sound good.

731
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,490
What did I do?

732
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,510
Wait, what did I do?

733
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,780
Uh-oh.

734
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,800
Halligan, come on in.

735
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,120
I suppose we should be glad that you drop in now and then.

736
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:17,960
What's the matter, Chief?

737
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,700
I'm doing my job.

738
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,820
You know, Halligan, I was just asking myself what you've been doing.

739
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,460
I've been investigating, Chief.

740
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,500
Well, have you?

741
00:50:26,720 --> 00:51:30,540
And do you know what I've been doing I've been dismissing loads of press people worried citizens and politicians from my office the phone hasn't stopped ringing since this morning the mayor's been to my office and I haven't seen much of you when do you expect to come up with results I'm getting there chief I'm getting there chief but it takes time takes time takes time will I ever get to hear anything else from a detective where the heck have you been Halligan you're get a report at the end of the week the end of the week why not at the end of the month or the end of the year I want the results on my desk tomorrow morning Halligan and now I want to know where you've been all this time we I mean sorry sorry I just got back from France and I'm like you know like still in French Britain we you'll find out when you read the report I'm going to write don't be impertinent detective as your chief I'm entitled to ask you about the results of investigations and your proceedings whenever I like.

742
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,360
Yes, Chief, of course.

743
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,380
That sounds better.

744
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:39,660
Otherwise, I could have you write a report about every single step of your proceedings, and I think you know that.

745
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,380
Very well, then.

746
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,140
I was visiting an expert on druids.

747
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,160
You wrote what?

748
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,880
Alligan, have you lost your marbles?

749
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,060
You're not supposed to be indulging in your hobbies.

750
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,380
You're supposed to be solving the skeleton murders.

751
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,780
Is that all?

752
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,860
Oh, my hobbies!

753
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,040
Wow, I wish I could be a druid.

754
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,180
Is that all, Chief?

755
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,060
No, that is not all.

756
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,120
One of the phone calls this morning was from the 4th District in Oxford.

757
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,000
Another murder?

758
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:05,760
And?

759
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,940
A beggar has been to see them.

760
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,640
He claimed that somebody had first put him to sleep and then robbed him.

761
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,100
Wait.

762
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,420
And do you know who that person was?

763
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,860
Do I have consequences for my actions?

764
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,040
A man who calls himself Detective Halligan.

765
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,700
Our colleagues looked into the central personal database and guess what?

766
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,080
They found a man by the name of Detective Halligan.

767
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,360
for my department I just gave him what he asked for the

768
00:52:35,930 --> 00:53:37,710
the beggar must be mistaken chief the beggar must be mistaken it's a mix-up it's a mix-up I hope so if these accusations turn out to be true you can spend the rest of your professional life washing police cars um I I what did you when did you receive when did you received the phone call from our colleagues oh less than half an hour ago have you any idea how embarrassed i was about the affair the colleague i talked to said that the beggar still had some of the substance he'd been knocked out with medical alcohol with apple juice haligan please tell me you didn't do it i had nothing to do with it chief honestly well i hope your benefit he says honestly you to start looking into the case at hand well chief you know i asked everybody in office to help me find my wallet and you know what nobody agreed so i had to do what i had to do

769
00:53:41,050 --> 00:54:02,950
you know i could be considered the beggar because i was begging for help and nobody wanted to help me it was just a prank okay chief i read you indeed Excellent, detective.

770
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,210
Then get out and do your job.

771
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,110
I've been!

772
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:14,590
If I should hear that you are conducting your investigations in any dubious or illegal way, I'll take you off the case immediately.

773
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:15,650
Understood, Chief.

774
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:16,650
Yes, Chief.

775
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,050
You think he is mad at me?

776
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,330
I didn't think that that would happen.

777
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,710
Let's go talk to the guy that supplied me with the stuff.

778
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:29,850
Are we the baddies?

779
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:30,450
No.

780
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,470
Um, hey you!

781
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,950
Wait, what are you working on over there?

782
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,030
What is this stink?

783
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,690
Wait, what is that?

784
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,150
Was that there before?

785
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,310
Wait, what- There's nothing I can do with this.

786
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,590
What is that?

787
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,370
I don't remember seeing that before.

788
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,550
Okay, anyway.

789
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:53,370
Hello.

790
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,110
Hey, Halligan.

791
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,230
How'd you get on with Miss Turner?

792
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,050
Are you gonna see her again?

793
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,850
You could say that.

794
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:01,550

795
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:35,520

00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,080
Okay, I saw someone say to read a walkthrough.

798
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,500
Oh wait, we have a message though.

799
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,520

802

Is that you?

803
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,900
Or is it the queen?

804
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,800

£275?

808
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,120
Wow, that's my personal record.

809
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:42,980
Guy!

810
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,600
Hello, Mr. Halligan.

811
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,400
This is Melanie Turner speaking.

812
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,860
I was wondering why I hadn't heard from you, but Mr. Blake just called and told me everything.

813
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,600
Oh, my God, I'm crying.

814
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:56,000
I'm out and about quite a lot at the moment, and you may have difficulties trying to get me on the phone.

815
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,440
But if you need me, just leave a message.

816
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:58,960
Okay.

817
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,600

818
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,460
See you later.

819
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,460
Let me give you some good advice, Detective Halligan.

820
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,820
Don't interfere with our affairs.

821
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,400
It wouldn't be very healthy.

822
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,100
What?

823
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:12,920
What was that?

824
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,760
No way!

825
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,960
That's about 485 pounds today.

826
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:23,720
What?

827
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,580
Uh-oh, we got a call from the Druids!

828
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,860

Okay.

832
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:08,800
Resume.

833
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:15,740
Can you guys tell how like messed up my screen is without like the window looks?

834
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,660
Oh gosh.

835
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,600
I hope the Druids win.

836
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,080
Yeah.

837
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:19,400
Okay.

838
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,340
So, do we need to like call?

839
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,340
I never use the receiver.

840
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,860
That thing is just too heavy.

841
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,900
Using the loudspeaker is much more comfortable.

842
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,920
Do we need to like call, what's her name?

843
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,520
Uh...

844
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,880
Melanie, maybe, but I don't know her phone number.

845
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,820
Chief Inspector Miller will get this.

846
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,240
The results of the investigation in my last case.

847
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:42,760
Conclusion?

848
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,880
The offender could not be determined.

849
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:46,720
Oh, no.

850
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,680
My writing desk.

851
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,380
I am definitely the only one who can make head or tail of it.

852
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,160
Can we?

853
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:52,780
Can we?

854
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,620
Yeah, can we?

855
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,200
Unfortunately, there's no pizza in there anymore.

856
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,520
Al's Pizza Palace makes the best pizza in the whole of London.

857
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,360
Al's pizza palace makes the best pizza in the whole of London.

858
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,960
Al's pizza palace makes the best pizza in the whole world.

859
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,060
God, why does he call it that?

860
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,300
Is that a British thing?

861
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,560
Al's pizza palace makes the best pizza in the whole of London.

862
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,640
Oh, sorry, whole of London.

863
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,240
I was getting way ahead of myself.

864
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:34,980
My writing desk.

865
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,980
Oh, it's German.

866
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,840
Oh, okay, okay.

867
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,680
Oh, okay.

everyone.

870
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,460
Uh, my database inquiry.

871
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,500
What about my database inquiry now?

872
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,700
I don't like to repeat myself, Brent.

873
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,340
Have you not been listening?

874
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,820
Yes, of course I have.

875
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,740
Well, then you know it all, don't you?

876
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:30,300
Sure.

877
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,240
In that case, see you later, Brent.

878
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:34,600
Oh, okay.

879
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,040
Good.

880
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:35,960
See you later, then.

881
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,240
Take your time, Brent.

882
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,320
Thank you.

883
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,400
Yeah, she does hate me.

884
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,080
Okay.

885
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:46,940
Um.

886
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,680
Flowery?

887
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,000
You in here?

888
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,200
Oh, yeah.

889
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,040
Can I talk to you?

890
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,480
It's my thumbnail.

891
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,460
It's so good.

892
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,280
What is it this time, Halligan?

893
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,400
Have you ever heard of an organization called the Surveillance?

894
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,020
Have you ever heard of an organization called The Circle?

895
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:20,800
The Circle?

896
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,180
Is that somehow connected to the crop circles?

897
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,620
Okay, forget it, Larry.

898
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,720
She's got her cat-haired, covered scarf back.

899
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,980
I'd like to know how you managed to get a date with Janet.

900
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,780
I'd really like to know how a Braggard like you managed to get a date with Janet.

901
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,240
Well, you know what, Halligan?

902
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,140
Women do like a winner, don't they?

903
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,860
Little Janet is no exception.

904
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,640
We went to the palace yesterday.

905
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,480
What was showing?

906
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,540
The new Schwarzenegger film.

907
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,580
You know how to handle women, don't you?

908
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,240
Of course.

909
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:52,400
Janet said she found it disgusting, but I know for a fact that she was very keen on it.

910
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,700
Women are like that.

911
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,540
Do you understand?

912
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,060
Why should a woman like her find your boring story so entertaining?

913
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,740
Well, I would have thought that Janet had more sense.

914
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,760
Women like winners, minto.

915
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,540
I definitely read that as weeners.

916
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,420
I was like, how's that?

917
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,560
Okay.

918
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,220
Okay.

919
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,930
I love a good hot dog.

920
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,330
Um, yeah, I thought she had more sense.

921
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,350
Well, I would have thought that Janet had more sense.

922
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,850
Oh, actually, I think she's got very good sense.

923
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,870
That's why she always refuses to let you take her out somewhere.

924
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:42,170
She prefers to go out with a man who doesn't dress in rags, dragged out of rubbish bins, or eat the same pizza every day.

925
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,050
Would you say that?

926
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:45,490
The facts speak for themselves, Halligan.

927
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:49,150
You eat pizza in your office, and I go to the cinema with you.

928
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:57,430
Janet that's the way things work oh I'm sorry old boy dang what

929
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:50,510
amazes me is why a woman like her should find your boring stories about cars sports and action films so entertaining Halligan I'm sure you didn't come to tell why is his dialogue so different from the subtitles could I use your phone could I just use your phone haven't you got your own telephone Halligan I just wanted to try something I just wanted to try something and what if I might ask try to get a dialing tone that's right wait what are we where are we going with this that's right the chief can explain it to you for certain have fun you're a really nice you're a really nice person Lowry I do my best okay bye Okay,

930
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,430
I'll talk to you later, Lowry.

931
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:56,090
He doesn't even say bye to me.

932
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:59,070
Wait, but I want to know about the phone.

933
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,110
The phone.

934
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,150
Wait, where can I find Detective Stryker?

935
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:03,890
Who is that?

936
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,050
Where can I find Detective Stryker?

937
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:07,710
Stryker?

938
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,950
On holiday.

939
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:09,290
Why?

940
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,250
He still owes me money.

941
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,830
Okay, I heard he was suspended.

942
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,850
Who is this guy?

943
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:21,310
Okay.

944
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,530
Who is this guy?

945
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,530
Maybe he knows more about the organization called the Circle.

946
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:32,090
Oh, you're still going on about that, are you?

947
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:38,130
Well, if you want to hear my opinion, Halligan, those strange crop circles were drawn in the fields by a pensioner.

948
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,690
By the way, what's that got to do with the skeleton murders?

949
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:45,930
Dear God, Lowry, just tell me where I can find Stryker.

950
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,430
He could tell me in an envelope.

951
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:52,810
about the skeleton murders.

952
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,970
Halligan, I coordinated the case.

953
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,910
Striker was my right hand.

954
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,370
You won't get anything new out of him.

955
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:00,870
Could I use your phone?

956
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,870
Could I just use your phone?

957
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,850
Haven't you got your own telephone, Halligan?

958
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:05,730
I wanted to...

959
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,270
Oh, there's something not quite right with it.

960
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,390
Yes, but there's something not quite right with it.

961
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:10,450
No dialing tone.

962
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,030
Is that it?

963
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:14,990
What's your extension?

964
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:15,750
Tell me, Lowry.

965
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:16,870
What's your extension?

966
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:17,670
196.

967
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:18,650
You know that.

968
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,670
Yes, right.

969
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:20,770
I just forgotten it.

970
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,970
don't phone you so very often.

971
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,710
Yeah, and that's the way I like it, Halligan.

972
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,570
Don't you dare start ringing me up and getting on my nerves.

973
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,070
One nine six, everybody.

974
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,970
That's his codec.

975
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:32,650
How do you know that?

976
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,530
How do you know that?

977
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:41,110
Someone in accounts has had a look at the department's telephone bills, Halligan, and you're the record holder by a very, very wide margin.

978
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:41,550
Wait, what?

979
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,970
Your phone will only work internally from now on.

980
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,970
Janet told me that when we went to the cinema.

981
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,350
Where do you keep calling to?

982
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,490
Anyway, the Caribbean.

983
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,170
I don't think that's got anything to do with you, Lowry.

984
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,490
Oh, yes, okay, of course, sure.

985
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:54,790
It's none of my business.

986
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:58,850
But if you think that you can make your phone calls from here, you're dead wrong.

987
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:02,990
I think we might be a terrible, like, a terrible cop.

988
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,670
What is happening?

989
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:06,750
Wait, what?

990
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,880
Clearly not your mom.

991
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:15,160
Wait.

992
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,880
Tell me, Lowry, what's your extension?

993
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,640
196, you know that.

994
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,540
Yes, right.

995
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:19,880
Okay.

996
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,300
I'll talk to you later.

997
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:22,520
Bye.

998
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:23,360
Wait.

999
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:24,860
Oh.

1000
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,120
Halligan.

1001
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:30,840
Yes.

1002
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,400
Yes.

1003
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,600
Might I ask you what you think you're doing?

1004
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,680
I need Scissors 61.

1005
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,940
I don't know what you mean, Steve.

1006
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,720
I don't know what you mean, Steve.

1007
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,220
You don't know what I mean?

1008
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:50,100
You're trying to steal a pair of scissors from right under my nose, but you haven't got a clue what I'm talking about.

1009
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:50,800
Is that it?

1010
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,900
I don't need your scissors for very long.

1011
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:58,120
Now, listen, Lowry, I really don't need your scissors for very long.

1012
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,120
I said, forget it.

1013
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,980
All right, then, keep them.

1014
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,660
Why can we take the scissors?

1015
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,160
Wait, I was just trying to leave.

1016
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:10,900
Oh, there we go.

1017
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,520
It's at the bottom.

1018
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:11,880
Okay.

1019
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,020
What's wrong with this guy?

1020
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,320
Wait, now 196.

1021
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,600
Okay, 196.

1022
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:25,200
196.

1023
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:26,260
196.

1024
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,820
Scotland Yard, Detective Lowry.

1025
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:33,720
Hello?

1026
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:35,580
Hello?

1027
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,420
I never use the receiver.

1028
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:41,680
Oh.

1029
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,940
That thing is just too heavy.

1030
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,920
Using the loudspeaker is much more comfortable.

1031
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:45,960
What do you mean heavy?

1032
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,840
One, nine, six.

1033
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,380
Scotland Yard, Detective Lowry.

1034
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,340
Hello?

1035
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,240
Who's speaking?

1036
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:31,340
one nine six low level super villain ah pick up pick up Lowry okay I really don't know where to go from here okay actually let's go to maybe our lady friend who is not interested in us at all but we are shooting our shot I suppose she did say she was busy so I don't know if she'll actually be here.

1037
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,100
Get Lowry fired so you could steal his scissors.

1038
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,620
I'm not kidding.

1039
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:43,860
Wait, what?

1040
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,540
Oh, I can't go in.

1041
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:47,800
Did I knock?

1042
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,580
No, okay.

1043
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,320
Locked.

1044
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:52,520
Locked.

1045
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:53,960
Wait, what?

1046
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,490
Wait, is this the truth?

1047
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,150
Did you call her?

1048
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:04,970
I don't know her number.

1049
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:06,710
Oh, I guess we could call here.

1050
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:27,170

1051
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:40,500
i can't call her unless unless i memorized her number oh wait i have no money i can't hear any dialing yeah i have no more money i forgot

1053
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,520
I really needed money for the phone.

1054
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,600
And you got my lovely homemade schnapps in return.

1055
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,020
Gorgeous schnapps.

1056
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,840
That stuff wipe me out straight.

1057
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,600
I want nothing to do with you, mate.

1058
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,400
Get lost.

1059
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:30,420
Come on.

1060
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,440
Don't be like that.

1061
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,540
Don't be like that.

1062
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,280
You again.

1063
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,840
You better leave me alone.

1064
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,160
Yeah, I think he's going to stab me.

1065
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:36,820
You again.

1066
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,440
You better leave me alone.

1067
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,320
I think he might.

1068
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,280
I think he hates me.

1069
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,860
I think everybody hates me in this game.

1070
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,000
All right, let's...

1071
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Okay, well, I guess we're going to get...

1072
01:11:46,020 --> 01:12:14,360
him fired how we do that is um wait so we need the scissors for what justified absolutely you know Miller speaking okay I've had enough oh wait you better come to my office as soon as possible wait did you get that did oh wait what if I play this while I'm on the phone.

1073
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,360
Oh, wait, hold on.

1074
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,480
I just accidentally exited out of my capture.

1075
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,080
One second.

1076
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:18,980
Oh, wait.

1077
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:19,900
Maybe I'm a genius.

1078
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,560
Maybe I'm a genius.

1079
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:31,700
All right.

1080
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,020
So, 196.

1081
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,000
And then, which one was more angry?

1082
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:39,760
Alligan?

1083
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,700
Oh, no, not that one.

1084
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,140
This is Miller.

1085
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,020
Damn it, where are you?

1086
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,780
Do I have to speak to this damned answering machine if I want to get hold of you?

1087
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,820
Okay, it's the next one.

01:12:47,920 --> 01:13:14,520

1090
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,470
Let's see if he's back in there.

1091
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:57,150
Oh!

1092
01:13:59,550 --> 01:13:59,950
Hello.

1093
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,730
Halligan, where are my scissors?

1094
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,810
I've no idea.

1095
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:07,490
I thought they were on your desk just a minute ago.

1096
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:08,970
Don't lie to me, Halligan.

1097
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,270
I know you've got them.

1098
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:13,310
And what was that business with the chief all about?

1099
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,930
I really don't know what you're talking about.

1100
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:16,670
Steve.

1101
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,250
Let me make myself clear.

1102
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,690
I hate that kind of thing, Halligan.

1103
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,170
I've had quite enough trouble with the chief for one day.

1104
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:56,280

1106
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:54,620
uh use the scissors to save the queen

1107
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,040
We tried the museum.

1108
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,740
Well, we didn't have the scissors then, but...

1109
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,440
Check all the inventory items.

1110
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,560
Maybe we can combine it with something.

1111
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,820
That's futile as well.

1112
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:16,380
Just kidding.

1113
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:16,980
Of course.

1114
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:17,640
It can't.

1115
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,540
The green scarf.

1116
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,440
It's Janet's.

1117
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:35,110
Hmm.

1118
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:36,170
We know?

1119
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,230
Scissors are sacred.

1120
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:44,630
about the case.

1121
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,710
The papers with the clipboard.

1122
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:50,270
Oh, let's try it.

1123
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:51,190
That doesn't work.

1124
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:52,630
That doesn't work.

1125
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:53,210
There's no point.

1126
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,610
A sheet of carbon paper.

1127
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:56,950
Very useful when dealing with bureaucrats.

1128
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,150
Oh!

1129
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:59,630
That worked!

1130
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,050
I should think about it again.

1131
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:04,030
That's a form for stationary procurement.

1132
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:06,850
Without that, you don't get anything at Scotland Yard.

1133
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:09,050
Stationary procurement?

1134
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:09,970
What?

1135
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:11,610
A sheet of carbon paper.

1136
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:13,650
Very useful when dealing with bureaucrats.

1137
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,550
Very useful.

1138
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:15,550
A sheet of carbon paper.

1139
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,230
I don't want that.

1140
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:17,590
A sheet of carbon paper.

1141
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:17,930
Okay.

1142
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,950
Very useful when dealing with bureaucrats.

1143
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:22,230
Please draw a veto sitting on the copying.

1144
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:26,070
You need a famous purple stuffed worm.

1145
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,430
Okay, well...

1146
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:39,210
We...

1147
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,650
What about the salt?

1148
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:45,950
We use the salt to blow up the castle or the mausoleum.

1149
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:49,330
Okay, help!

1150
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:50,590
Help!

1151
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:51,870
Help!

1152
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:52,650
Head up in me!

1153
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,890
I don't know what to do next.

1154
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,330
I have no idea.

1155
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,920
No elf vine, then I'll look it up myself.

1156
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:10,980
Mystery.

1157
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,500
Of the druids.

1158
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,180
Walk through.

1159
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,240
We're trying to...

1160
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,660
Well, we didn't get him fired.

1161
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:24,780
Hmm.

1162
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,640
Use the carbon paper to trick a signature.

1163
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,140
I think all three papers did go, no?

1164
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,060
But it won't let me...

1165
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:37,180
That's a...

1166
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,740
A sheet of cart, of course.

1167
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,240
It won't let me like...

1168
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:42,660
Okay, hold on.

1169
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,940
Without that, you don't get anything at Scotland Yard.

1170
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,380
That's...

1171
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:46,200
What we can do...

1172
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:46,760
Okay, hold on.

1173
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,260
Okay, we can't use it unless...

1174
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,520
Maybe I have to be closer to him.

1175
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:53,880
Here we go.

1176
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:57,980
I don't need a signature for obtaining materials.

1177
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,160
I need one for obtaining information.

1178
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,240
That won't help either.

1179
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:11,520
So I need the sign- wait, why didn't I get the- they would have surprised me if it had worked like that.

1180
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,720
Wait, why don't I have the thing for obtaining materials?

1181
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,060
Wait.

1182
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,040
Back here.

1183
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:42,670
Okay.

1184
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:44,010
Which is which?

1185
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,770
We got the carbon paper.

1186
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:53,530
Wait, but...

1187
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:57,510
So I need to forge the signature, but like, what's the order?

1188
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,330
I already took them all.

1189
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,470
I already took them earlier.

1190
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:03,410
And now they're on here.

1191
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:05,890
That's a form for stationary procurement.

1192
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,610
Without that, you don't get anything at Scotland Yard.

1193
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,030
Talk to Janet.

1194
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:12,590
We could try.

1195
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:41,130
already talked to her though how does carbon paperwork i actually don't know hello janet no i don't think this is it it's the same combo anyway it's soaked through from the room the printer oh well we did ask what's his name about how the printer worked why should i copy that i can get loads of them from janet okay you're right this this also we don't why should i copy that

1196
01:20:47,240 --> 01:21:18,200
the order is clipboard carbon paper in both forms together but i did that a clipboard a sheet of carbon paper that's a form for stationary procurement without that you don't get anything at scotland yard you need to put the regular paper in something hard i did the i did oh this is it oh my gosh i didn't realize it moved in my inventory oh that's why okay That's what was confusing me so much,

1197
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:18,780
you guys.

1198
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,740
I was like, what's happening?

1199
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:22,740
Okay, there we go.

1200
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,500
Okay, that's...

1201
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:27,140
Because I was like, oh, it's on the clipboard already.

1202
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,000
That's why I was so confused!

1203
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,580
Okay, we're fine now.

1204
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,600
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1205
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,300
Mr. Mr. I have a form for you to sign.

1206
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,120
The carbon paper's still sticking out.

1207
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:41,400
Oh.

1208
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,480
The chief is bound to notice that.

1209
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:45,500
Okay.

1210
01:21:46,780 --> 01:22:15,260
use the scissors right in front of him okay here you go chief I've got an 88 m9 order form for stationary here for stationary you need new stationary again Halligan you'll lead this department to financial ruin someday do you know that yes sir no I mean no sir it's nothing extravagant I could do with a new pencil sharpener that's all when will you learn to take better care of your things If they hate him so much,

1211
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,120
they should fire him.

1212
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:19,580
Every month the accounts department gives me a hard time because of the deficit.

1213
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,220
Our budget for office costs is limited.

1214
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:26,460
I know, Chief, but I'm not able to work without a minimum of stationary.

1215
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,360
Here, I've prepared this for you.

1216
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,640
You just need to sign it.

1217
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,100
Okay then, okay, give it to me.

1218
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,920
Thank you, sir.

1219
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,300
But that's the last time.

1220
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:39,780
Do you understand?

1221
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,960
You'll have to buy the next sharpener from your own money.

1222
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:42,560
Yes, sir.

1223
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,480
Anything else, detective?

1224
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,260
Nope, that was it.

1225
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,580
No, that was it.

1226
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,240
That's good.

1227
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,920
You know the way out, don't you, detective?

1228
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,640
Of course, chief.

1229
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,920
Oh my goodness, everybody's so rude.

1230
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,360
Okay, yay, we got a signature!

1231
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,560
Now we can use the database to finally learn about the circle.

1232
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:09,760
The circle of London.

1233
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:10,980
Oh, is she okay?

1234
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,500
Oh, I thought she was crying.

1235
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,800
Hello, Janet.

1236
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,200
Hello, Janet.

1237
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:15,640
Oh.

1238
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,700
Wait, I think I need to give the thing to her.

1239
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,360
Here you go.

1240
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,100
It's me again, Janet.

1241
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:21,960
Hello, Brent.

1242
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,180
How's your case going?

1243
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,580
Have you got any further yet?

1244
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:26,600
Um.

1245
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,800
Did you miss me?

1246
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,060
Well, it was nice and quiet without you, Halligan.

1247
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,940
Lowry was in real trouble with the chief.

1248
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,600
But apart from that, heavenly peace.

1249
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,540
Lowry's had bother with the chief?

1250
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,620
Whoa, what did happen?

1251
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,800
Lowry's had a bother with the chief.

1252
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,080
What happened?

1253
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,300
I don't know exactly.

1254
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:48,780
It was strange.

1255
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,520
The chief didn't want to see Lowry for a whole day.

1256
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:56,140
But Lowry still came into his office because he thought that the chief had called him.

1257
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,060
I don't know what was going on there.

1258
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,180
Well, Brent, what do you need?

1259
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,620
I need information about a group.

1260
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,520
I'm looking for information about a group called the Circle.

1261
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,400
The Circle.

1262
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:07,640
Just a sec.

1263
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,140
It won't take a moment.

1264
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,140
Oh, it won't take a moment.

1265
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,120
Will it be longer or shorter?

1266
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:18,020
Yes, we've got something in the database about them.

1267
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,200
Let me see.

1268
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,700
The Circle of London.

1269
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,400
An order of Neo-Druits.

1270
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,180
Their head office is in London.

1271
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:32,080
The head of the group is called Lord Sinclair.

1272
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,400
Lord Sinclair.

1273
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,780
Do you know anyone with a criminal record?

1274
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,120
Do we know about anyone with a criminal record within the group?

1275
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,780
Just give me a second, Brent.

1276
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,040
Wait, why did I say Wyatt?

1277
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,520
No, you're fine.

1278
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,320
Somebody once filed a complaint against Lord Sinclair.

1279
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,340
I was doing the whole like, enjoy your food.

1280
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:53,940
You too.

1281
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,660
Is that all?

1282
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:58,800
Ah!

1283
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,160
No, hang on.

1284
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:05,540
Some months ago, a gardener was killed on Sinclair's estate.

1285
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,020
And the murderer was never found.

1286
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:08,800
Oh my god.

1287
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:44,260
After the murder, Lord Sinclair and his order were under surveillance some time but there was nothing conspicuous to be found oh that's interesting anything else well sinclair was fined once wait so this guy has a record no nothing else wow that's a lot could you print that out for me could you please print that out for me of course would you mind telling me what these neo druids have to do with your case is this one of your usual mad ideas I don't think so.

1288
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,180
I don't think so.

1289
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,460
I'll have a closer look at these people anyway.

1290
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,600
Well then, happy hunting.

1291
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,640
Unless she gave it to me.

1292
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:51,180
Thanks, Jen.

1293
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:51,420
Good.

1294
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:52,720
Thanks a lot, Janet.

1295
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:53,740
I have to go.

1296
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:54,640
Okay, Brent.

1297
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:55,760
See you later.

1298
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,740
Uh, is this it?

1299
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,420
This is not it.

1300
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,160
Where's the thing that she gave me?

1301
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:07,260
Hello, Janet.

1302
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,420
Wait, did she give me the address?

1303
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,760
Calligan, what's up?

1304
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:10,360
A ss.

1305
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,980
Oh, could you print the data once again?

1306
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:44,460
more could you print out the data once more well you've already got one copy that's enough okay okay thank you anyway Janet don't mention it Brent maybe I need a copy of it maybe I can make my own copy not sure why I would need that but we'll see oh is this it it won't work like that ah sorry I was just trying to lift it up.

1307
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:50,000
The printer in the room with her.

1308
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,140
Oh, I see, I see.

1309
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,900
Oh, it printed there and there.

1310
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:59,420
Oh, I thought it was, I thought it was, like, going to print and then she hands it to me.

1311
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,900
Wait, where's the printer?

1312
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,200
Oh, there it is.

1313
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:06,580
Oh, I never noticed it.

1314
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,920
That's the printout of the database information on the circle.

1315
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,840
Lord Sinclair's address is on it as well.

1316
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,180
Oh, okay.

1317
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,540
234 Winchester Street.

1318
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,880
234 Winchester Street.

1319
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,340
We got it.

1320
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,280
Do I want to make another copy?

1321
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,300
I don't know why.

1322
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,160
Let's see.

1323
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,060
I don't know why I would need one, but just in case, because this game is nonsensical.

1324
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:33,580
Interesting.

1325
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,000
We can make another copy.

1326
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:40,920
Okay.

1327
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,560
Now I have two copies.

1328
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,760
Just for whatever I want?

1329
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,720
Okay, let's go.

1330
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,080
234 Winchester Street.

1331
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:54,520
More.

1332
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:56,120
Wait.

1333
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,080
None of these are that address.

1334
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:05,120
Oh, just kidding.

1335
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,000
I should leave a message for Ms. Turner.

1336
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,500
I don't know why I didn't read that at all.

1337
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,320
Oh, leave a message for Ms. Turner.

1338
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:15,880
Here?

1339
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,420
I don't have her number, though.

1340
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,140
The third one for good luck.

1341
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,120
Miss?

1342
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,080
Miller speaking.

1343
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,500
We don't have any new ones, right?

1344
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,480
No, okay.

1345
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,760
Uh, how am I supposed to call her?

1346
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,580
Oh, yeah, my phone doesn't work.

1347
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,140
You're right.

1348
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:48,620
Okay, Lowry, please.

1349
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:49,500
Lowry.

1350
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,520
Lowry, please.

1351
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,140
Wait, do we have to do it again?

1352
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,580
Nowry, can I use your fallen?

1353
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,630
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

1354
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:02,960
Nowry, can I please, please?

1355
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:03,420
You again?

1356
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,660
I don't want to see you here again today, Halligan.

1357
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:06,820
Okay.

1358
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:10,640
Okay.

1359
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,500
Okay, we're going to try the thing we just did.

1360
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:15,540
196.

1361
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,140
196.

1362
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:26,370
I've already got the scissors.

1363
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:26,730
Oh.

1364
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,610
And Lowry has already had enough fun with the boss.

1365
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,090
How do I leave a message for her?

1366
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:38,190
Oh, wait.

1367
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,490
Maybe this guy, he will be able to.

1368
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,470
Because he knows the professor.

1369
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:49,900
I know you can hear the hurt in his voice when he's just like, I don't want to see you again.

1370
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,000
Come on.

1371
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:50,660
Are you alright, Halligan?

1372
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,360
How are you getting on?

1373
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:52,720
Yeah.

1374
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:53,700
Everything's fine.

1375
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:54,280
Thanks.

1376
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:55,900
Wait, what?

1377
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,140
No.

1378
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:56,920
Are you alright, Halligan?

1379
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,000
Yeah.

1380
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,320
It won't let me...

1381
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:03,600
Well, okay, let's...

1382
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,320
It wouldn't let me go to the St. Clair place, but maybe we can go to the museum.

1383
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,320
Since he was saying he wants to leave a message, so...

1384
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,980
Oh, we could probably put the file through the...

1385
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,100
The door.

1386
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,880
Like the little mail slot, you know?

1387
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:34,540
Here.

1388
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,460
There you go, ma'am.

1389
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,160
Okay.

1390
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,220
That should be enough for Ms. Turner to find me in case something happens to me.

1391
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:46,820
Yes.

1392
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,820
There's a little rut.

1393
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,200
I know it's so funny.

1394
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,640
He's such a goofy guy.

1395
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,020
Okay.

1396
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,060
Now we can go to Lord Sinclair.

1397
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,830
Not a bad little villa.

1398
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:09,310
This Sinclair doesn't seem to be a poor man.

1399
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:11,250
Not at all.

1400
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:12,390
Not a bad little villa.

1401
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:14,850
This Sinclair doesn't seem to be a poor man.

1402
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:15,890
Wait, what's over here?

1403
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:22,530
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, let's let's try the front door first.

1404
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:25,350
Ping pong.

1405
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:30,070
Those dogs?

1406
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:33,010
Yes, who's there?

1407
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:34,290
Is that Lord Sinclair?

1408
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:35,370
No, sir.

1409
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:36,530
I'm sorry.

1410
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,210
I am his lordship's butler.

1411
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:40,990
Wait, save?

1412
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:42,690
Should I get out of this first?

1413
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:44,770
Wait, should I save first before I do this?

1414
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:45,310
Hold on.

1415
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:46,390
Oh, wait.

1416
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:47,830
Let's save here.

1417
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:48,750
My bad.

1418
01:31:54,350 --> 01:32:42,170

1420
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:54,090
Am I correct in assuming that you do not possess a search warrant?

1421
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:55,330
Well...

1422
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:56,310
Then I would like to...

1423
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:57,230
Yeah, say Lowry!

1424
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,970
Say Lowry!

1425
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:02,330
Violent and unauthorized intrusion onto the estate can be prosecuted.

1426
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:05,650
I'll be back.

1427
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:07,750
If that's the way you want it, alright then.

1428
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:08,810
I'll be back.

1429
01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:10,050
You can be sure of that.

1430
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:11,250
Of course, sir.

1431
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,850
Oh no!

1432
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,170
Why'd you say her name?

1433
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:14,410
Have a nice day.

1434
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:17,890
Why'd you say it?

1435
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:19,110
Why'd you say it?

1436
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:24,350
Oh, oh, wait, it's that!

1437
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,060
This river is really huge.

1438
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:33,700
Such a palace.

1439
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:34,840
Ricky Martin.

1440
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,120
I need one person.

1441
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:37,980
Ricky Martin.

1442
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:38,700
Ricky Martin.

1443
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:50,520
This man is tall.

1444
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:52,440
Hello.

1445
01:33:53,520 --> 01:34:25,100
today isn't it yeah the weather is great just right for a walk yes that's what i thought i didn't want to sit in the office any longer on such a wonderful autumn day yes i know what you mean what kind of job do you do then me oh i work with the agricultural office administration of public areas that kind of thing you know really is there something wrong with lord sinclair's I'm here on a private visit.

1446
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:27,280
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

1447
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,440
Oh yeah, I'm just like, trust, I'm just walking around this guy's property.

1448
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,520
Always says his day before committing his crimes.

1449
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:41,400
Yeah, professional pride.

1450
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,900
Uh, you work for him?

1451
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,260
Well, yeah, what are you doing?

1452
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,260
What are you doing at the moment?

1453
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,840
I have to cut the hedges.

1454
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,020
They grew rampantly this summer.

1455
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:58,400
Lord Sinclair doesn't want them to project over the paths where they could be in the way of walkers.

1456
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,260
He's a conscientious person.

1457
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,400
Yeah, thank you.

1458
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,020
Oh, yes, absolutely.

1459
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:10,300
He leads a very secluded life here, and he's always conscious of not doing anything that could annoy other people.

1460
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,040
I see.

1461
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:15,440
I.

1462
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,260
You may need...

1463
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:17,540
Wait.

1464
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,280
What could annoy people out here?

1465
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:21,980
Wait, didn't he get that complaint, though?

1466
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,000
He has annoyed people.

1467
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,940
What could annoy people out here?

1468
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:31,280
Well, somebody could feel disturbed by disorderly hedges, for example, or somebody could get hurt.

1469
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:34,560
There would be a complaint or a caution or something like that.

1470
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,660
Oh my gosh, no.

1471
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,380
Not an HOA.

1472
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,200
He doesn't like things like that.

1473
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:43,720
He wants everything done in a way that guarantees that he won't be bothered.

1474
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:44,820
Okay.

1475
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,600
You mean he wants to be left in peace?

1476
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:50,120
Yes, you could say that.

1477
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,360
Even I don't see him very often.

1478
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,440
often travels with a gentleman from his club.

1479
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:56,640
Oh, club.

1480
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,660
What's Lord Sinclair's profession?

1481
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,500
What's Lord Sinclair's profession?

1482
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,000
You mean, does he work?

1483
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,600
Or you don't have to work when you're that rich.

1484
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,580
I think he plays the stock market.

1485
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:10,020
Oh.

1486
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,280
And sometimes his bodyguards talk about new deliveries.

1487
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:13,840
People.

1488
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,100
Lord Sinclair is certainly involved in some sort of import-export business.

1489
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,580
They're probably sacrifices.

1490
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,000
I don't think that he needs the money.

1491
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:55,400
is he's just a hobby of his or something like that yeah flesh so he has bodyguards so he has bodyguards of course a man in his position needs them and i can tell you you wouldn't fool around with them two former officers from the foreign legion you know what kind of people they are i'm always very careful with them anyway i try to keep out of their way is this lordship afraid of something i think he's just a very careful man Does he travel often?

1492
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:56,140
Does he travel often?

1493
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:57,980
Is he at home right now?

1494
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,960
Yes, he is at home at the moment.

1495
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,360
He has some visitors.

1496
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,380
I think he and his friends are planning a little party.

1497
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,540
They're going to have dinner together tonight.

1498
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:08,900
They have done that quite often recently.

1499
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:09,600
The Butler lie.

1500
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:10,940
This guy is just yapping.

1501
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:15,860
Hasn't he got employees who arranged these things for him?

1502
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:18,340
Hasn't he got employees who arranged these things for him?

1503
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,160
Oh, sure.

1504
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,680
But his lordship is very choosy regarding those dinners.

1505
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:27,180
He insists on cooking everything himself and even buys the ingredients.

1506
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,580
He's a really passionate cook.

1507
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,660
He procures the ingredients through nefarious means?

1508
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,360
If I was rich, I'd have all my meals served in bed.

1509
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:37,440
So would I.

1510
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,100
You can bet your life on that.

1511
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,340
But really rich people have their own ideas about all that.

1512
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,740
Lord Sinclair always cooks meals himself.

1513
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:47,500
He buys them.

1514
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,380
He even locks the kitchen door.

1515
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:53,000
He probably doesn't want other people to know the recipes he uses.

1516
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,800
Yeah, because the ingredients are paper!

1517
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,940
Are there going to be many guests?

1518
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:04,480
Well, Lord Sinclair told me that he expects the four gentlemen from his club.

1519
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,360
And as usual, a guest of honor.

1520
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:07,920
Really?

1521
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,900
This guy is spilling all the secrets.

1522
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:13,340
It's a good thing he's not a villain.

1523
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,800
He would tell all his entire plan.

1524
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:22,060
Lord Sinclair always says that the guest of honor is the main person of a successful dinner.

1525
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:23,580
hospitable.

1526
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,980
His guests are very important to him.

1527
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:26,620
I see.

1528
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:27,420
I see.

1529
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,440
Well, I have to go.

1530
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,260
I have to go.

1531
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:30,300
Duty calls.

1532
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,420
It's like the family from the Walking Dead.

1533
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Exactly!

1534
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:33,720
Have a good day.

1535
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,100
Exactly!

1536
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:37,900
Oh.

1537
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,700
You can get back to work.

1538
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:39,960
Oh!

1539
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,690
Oh, so good.

1540
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,150
What's on the other side?

1541
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:56,910
Maybe we can eavesdrop.

1542
01:38:58,210 --> 01:38:58,950
Ricky Martin.

1543
01:39:01,490 --> 01:39:03,390
I don't know any other Ricky Martin.

1544
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:34,630
song other than live in Lavinia Loka but I think that's probably most people too know what's here a fence it's uh wait I can use the scissors some of the wires are too thick for these little scissors dang it I see oh my gloves I can't see any connection there you hold the gloves or you hold this the wires with the He'll rip it apart.

1545
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:38,770
Why won't it say anything, though?

1546
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:44,150
He doesn't say, like, oh, what a peculiar fence.

1547
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:46,110
No, he has no commentary.

1548
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:51,770
Hmm.

1549
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:54,410
What if I say I'm the guest of honor?

1550
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:55,570
Oh, wait.

1551
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,450
Hold on.

1552
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:58,030
Let's save.

1553
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:01,570
Uh.

1554
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:04,490
Sit.

1555
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:04,950
Oh, here.

1556
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:07,070
I'll just do Pinto 7.

1557
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:13,710
Hello, it's me and the guest of honor!

1558
01:40:17,230 --> 01:40:19,030
Yes, the ghost of honor.

1559
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:19,870
That is me.

1560
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:21,390
Yes, who is it?

1561
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:22,250
It's me again.

1562
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:23,150
Open the door.

1563
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:28,670
Sir, I don't think that it makes sense to repeat our unpleasant conversation.

1564
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:30,570
Now you listen to me, my friend.

1565
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:32,830
You will now immediately...

1566
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:39,290
I don't mean to interrupt you, sir, but if you don't mind, I will ignore your ringing from now on.

1567
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:41,190
Have a nice day, sir.

1568
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:46,430
Why did we say that?

1569
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:48,670
After all this information, we were just fed.

1570
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:51,270
Why didn't we say, oh, yes, it's me, the guest of honor?

1571
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:52,670
It's locked.

1572
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,430
Like, why would we...

1573
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:01,590
Why would we be like, oh, yeah.

1574
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:06,600
It's me again.

1575
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:08,560
What if he will hear...

1576
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:09,900
Ignore me this time.

1577
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:15,100
Locked.

1578
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,800
Oh, he did ignore me!

1579
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,960
We have to break an entry.

1580
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:24,940
Let's see.

1581
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:29,740
With this.

1582
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:31,140
That won't get me any further.

1583
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:35,580
Light it on fire.

1584
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:36,080
It won't work.

1585
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,060
No, better not.

1586
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:38,180
It's a distraction!

1587
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:55,460
me it will work like that if you light the plants on fire and then they will run the people will run and there'll be a distraction haligan didn't find the previous conversation to be unpleasant the butler was way more polite to him than all of the colleagues

1588
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:06,680
these aren't the plants that were in my boat room is it i oh

1589
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:17,800
I'm much too far away There's an open window I see

1590
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:42,450
I wish I had more salt Salt, salt We need more salt Snow, snow We need more snow Okay, I'm gonna throw fire on this guy Hello my friend, it's me again Hello.

1591
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:45,010
Not in the right mood for office air yet.

1592
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:45,930
Nah.

1593
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:49,590
I'd like to ask you some things concerning our little conversation.

1594
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:50,310
Of course.

1595
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:51,110
Just ask.

1596
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:52,950
I'll be finished here soon anyway.

1597
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:54,050
Oh.

1598
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:56,750
What are you doing at the moment?

1599
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:57,770
What are you doing at the moment?

1600
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:59,350
I have to cut the hedges.

1601
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:01,550
They grew rampantly this summer.

1602
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:03,290
Lord Sinclair doesn't want to...

1603
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:05,070
Oh, it's always... And his...

1604
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:09,310
Okay, so this is all the same.

1605
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:10,610
I have to go.

1606
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:11,650
Duty calls.

1607
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:13,390
Don't work too hard.

1608
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:13,890
Thanks.

1609
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:15,270
Have a good day.

1610
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:17,630
Thank you.

1611
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:19,310
Oh.

1612
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:22,370
He saw what I was about to do.

1613
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:23,630
I'd better not light that.

1614
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:26,770
He saw what I was about to do.

1615
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:27,030
Wait.

1616
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:28,430
What if I help him out?

1617
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:29,170
Hey, buddy.

1618
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:30,150
You need a little...

1619
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:30,930
A snip in hand.

1620
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:32,430
I'd rather not cut that.

1621
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:33,850
You need a snip in hand?

1622
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,610
I got you.

1623
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:37,270
I can also cut the hedges.

1624
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:38,330
Wait.

1625
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:41,930
I'd rather not cut.

1626
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:42,610
that.

1627
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:47,550
You need some gloves?

1628
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:49,270
That won't feel different with gloves either.

1629
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:50,250
Okay.

1630
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:53,130
Okay.

1631
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:00,530
Okay.

1632
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:03,410
This villa is really huge.

1633
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:07,050
Such a palace for only one person.

1634
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,250
Oh wait, what's this?

1635
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:09,990
Do I set this on fire?

1636
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:15,110
A lot of cut grass.

1637
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:21,370
Oh, wait.

1638
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:24,850
Wait.

1639
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:26,490
What?

1640
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,200
It's a disaster.

1641
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,020
Oh, my God.

1642
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:40,060
Oh, he's acting like a Sims.

1643
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:40,760
For real.

1644
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,500
Okay, let's take his scissors.

1645
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:56,680
Nemi, thank you so much for the break.

1646
01:44:58,660 --> 01:44:59,880
Come back, everybody.

1647
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:24,080
the sims was nimi able to i was able to watch for just only a little bit was nimi able to survive as a teenager oh thank you so much for the redirect this game is really nonsensical but it's very funny nimi actually i i recommend you play this i think you might like it

1648
01:45:30,250 --> 01:46:52,920
oh save oops damn the shears are broken i did commit arson I did wait save game we could always do that again if I have to set things on fire look how many saves I have everybody we could go in now go go go not touch it it could be electrified with my gloves Lord Sinclair is prepared nothing happens yeah then go inside nothing happens with the gloves the green scarf it's Janet's no I don't care maybe it is not a good idea no how do I get in then cut more oh I can cut more okay now these are broken scissors are broken as well but the hole should be big enough now okay let's go in stop wait a minute the fence is electrified oh the gloves here we go I don't know why this is called mystery of the druids and not the many crimes of Brent Halligan stop oh wait a minute go inside oh here we go i thought it wouldn't work like that okay now i can climb through here what if i touch the fence oh my god okay dangerous uh the scarf i'd rather think about it again no the fence that would be stupid

1649
01:46:52,920 --> 01:47:10,080
what do you mean that doesn't work you said it was big enough have you seen my scissors no the scarf it won't work like a scarf at the bottom i'd rather want that.

1650
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:11,580
Think first, Brent.

1651
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:12,240
No, better not.

1652
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:13,200
He's yelling at me.

1653
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,380
It won't work like that.

1654
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:15,080
That won't get me.

1655
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:16,300
It looks like that won't work.

1656
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:17,740
I can't do that.

1657
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:20,780
It's nonsensical.

1658
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:22,560
No, better.

1659
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:23,320
That won't help.

1660
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,140
I thought it was.

1661
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:25,180
There's no point in that.

1662
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,600
That's futile as well.

1663
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,040
Wait.

1664
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,220
I don't believe it will work like that.

1665
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,220
Think, Brent.

1666
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:32,980
Think.

1667
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:35,560
Brento.

1668
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,480
Need to combine two nonsensical items.

1669
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:58,460
it won't work like that now the bucket's hanging from the fishing rod I thought it wouldn't work like that okay uh hmm that doesn't work what what I created a pillow alrighty here we go

1670
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:13,360
not any sense of urgency how do you do Mr. Halligan how nice of you to visit us you know my name Ricky Martin Certainly.

1671
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:16,100
Lord Sinclair has been expecting you.

1672
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,840
I'm the guest of honor?

1673
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,220
Is that boss of yours some kind of psychic or what?

1674
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:22,400
Why don't you ask him that yourself?

1675
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:23,200
Let's go.

1676
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,100
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1677
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:31,480
Uh-oh.

1678
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,460
Uh-oh.

1679
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,580
Is it because I committed arson or...

1680
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:41,220
Okay, we gotta watch them walk inside.

1681
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:42,500
Longest cuts in.

1682
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:47,440
But we know that window was open, so we have an escape route.

1683
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,460
I thought that's how I was getting in.

1684
01:48:57,910 --> 01:49:03,150
Mr. Halligan, it is a great pleasure to meet you in person at long last.

1685
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:05,450
The pleasure's mine.

1686
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:10,530
Would you mind telling your charming pet gorilla here to point a damn pistol somewhere else?

1687
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:11,990
Thank you guys for all the don't know...

1688
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:14,570
Give us this precautionary measure, Mr. Halligan.

1689
01:49:15,610 --> 01:49:17,830
I happen to be a distrustful man.

1690
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:28,230
Lord Sinclair, now that we've met, there are a few questions I'd really like to ask you.

1691
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:31,330
Certainly, certainly.

1692
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:35,570
After dinner, I will answer any questions you tend to ask me.

1693
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:38,150
Until then, please be my guest.

1694
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:42,650
Jack, please be good enough to show our guest to his chamber.

1695
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:45,590
You do not seem to be quite aware.

1696
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:48,270
of the situation you are in, Lord Sinclair.

1697
01:49:49,110 --> 01:49:49,490
Well, no.

1698
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:51,250
I think it's the opposite.

1699
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:53,890
I don't want to have dinner with you.

1700
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:58,230
I'm here because of a series of murders, but you are a prime suspect.

1701
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:04,450
With all due respect, Mr. Halligan, I took you for a wiser man than that.

1702
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:08,990
If anyone here is unaware of the situation they are in, you are.

1703
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:09,810
Yes.

1704
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:11,930
I have asked you to be my guest at dinner.

1705
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:14,470
Please don't disappoint me by refusing.

1706
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:19,610
I will have to ask Jack here to persuade you to stay in his own way.

1707
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:21,230
I understand.

1708
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:23,270
I'm to stay here voluntarily.

1709
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:25,690
Because if I don't, you'll force me.

1710
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:26,350
Is that it?

1711
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:28,850
I'm glad we've settled that.

1712
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:33,870
He's so old, but his skin is so smooth that the thing...

1713
01:50:33,870 --> 01:50:33,950
I...

1714
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:38,230
We will discuss everything else in detail later over dinner.

1715
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:39,030
Okay.

1716
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:40,650
Let's go.

1717
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:46,990
Ooh.

1718
01:50:48,990 --> 01:50:58,900
thank you very much oh he locked the door he locked me in wait did he keep the key in there okay

1719
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:08,390

1720
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:22,300
yep here we are here we are here we are me too i'm just gonna keep making saves too lazy We got some fruit?

1721
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,540
Maybe poisoned.

1722
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,940
The handles are locked.

1723
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,160
Lord Sinclair thinks of everything.

1724
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:34,180
This seems to be the way to the forest behind the house.

1725
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:34,940
I see.

1726
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:35,980
I see.

1727
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:37,400
This seems to be the way to the forest.

1728
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,160
Okay.

1729
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,040
What's in here?

1730
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:40,940
Firmly locked.

1731
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,000
A wardrobe.

1732
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,000
A wardrobe.

1733
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,200
What's this?

1734
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,380
These pictures are ugly.

1735
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:49,420
What are...

1736
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:50,580
These look fine to me.

1737
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:51,260
These pictures are ugly.

1738
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:52,420
This is the ugly thing.

1739
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:55,840
Oh, my God.

1740
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,460
We triggered a cutscene somehow.

1741
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,520
Night has arrived.

1742
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,680
That's all I needed.

1743
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,800
The picture looks even weirder in the dark.

1744
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,460
I took it.

1745
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:21,500
Yoink.

1746
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,420
We just stuffed that in our pockets.

1747
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,060
You think dinner's ready?

1748
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,340
Do we know how to turn on the light?

1749
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:29,560
Typical of guest rooms.

1750
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:31,420
These pictures are ugly.

1751
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:34,240
The music's spooky.

1752
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:38,380
We just took it.

1753
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:40,520
Okay.

1754
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:44,500
That's the picture with a tasteful motif.

1755
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,460
Can't do anything without the key.

1756
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:50,560
This door looks really solid.

1757
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,060
Okay, we know.

1758
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:53,380
We can use the fishing.

1759
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,160
That would be stupid.

1760
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,600
No, it would not because you need to get the key.

1761
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:58,460
What if I slide it under?

1762
01:52:58,740 --> 01:52:58,940
Hmm.

1763
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:00,200
Nothing's happening.

1764
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:03,040
Okay.

1765
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,580
I can feel that something's going on out there.

1766
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:12,040
Screwed on.

1767
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,540
Wait, can I like...

1768
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:14,760
Dang it.

1769
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:15,740
What about with this?

1770
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:21,600
I know that it's like bent, but if it's just...

1771
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:24,580
If they're just screws, you could probably...

1772
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,620
I had the right idea of sliding.

1773
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,140
I did.

1774
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:29,940
Let's try it maybe.

1775
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:33,100
Can't do anything, but not a good idea.

1776
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,380
Okay, maybe not that, obviously, but...

1777
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,420
What else do we have?

1778
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,060
Fingerprint stuff.

1779
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,620
It won't work like that.

1780
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:42,980
No.

1781
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:44,420
This stuff.

1782
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:44,820
Hmm.

1783
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,220
That doesn't work.

1784
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:47,260
That doesn't work.

1785
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:48,900
Hmm.

1786
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:50,720
The bone.

1787
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,000
That would be stupid.

1788
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,380
Okay.

1789
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:53,700
Get closer.

1790
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:55,160
Can't do anything without the key.

1791
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:55,680
Oh, there we go.

1792
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:56,980
I didn't realize it was...

1793
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:57,480
Okay, okay.

1794
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:58,460
Oh!

1795
01:53:59,080 --> 01:53:59,520
Salt?

1796
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:01,140
No way.

1797
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:03,500
Oh, here we go.

1798
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:04,960
Ah, here we go, here we go.

1799
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:11,050
It won't improve if I put this picture next to it.

1800
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:13,550
What is that?

1801
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:15,610
What is the salt for?

1802
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:21,730
Yeah, that stuff is explosive.

1803
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:22,630
We gotta be careful.

1804
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:25,230
That won't feel different with gloves, either.

1805
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:27,150
Um...

1806
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:30,190
You could hurt yourself with those.

1807
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:32,790
There's no point in that.

1808
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:36,390
Okay, I'm trying to think of what, maybe fingerprints.

1809
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:38,010
That won't get me any further.

1810
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:40,530
I mean, I can't do anything with this here.

1811
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:44,470
Uh, hmm.

1812
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:46,450
The paper.

1813
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:51,650
It won't work like that.

1814
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:53,410
I mean, we can only...

1815
01:54:53,410 --> 01:54:56,290
That is no important evidence, I'm sure, about that.

1816
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:59,950
We can only use what we got, so it's got to be the case file again.

1817
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:31,390
it out of the frame i don't believe lauri's paper scissors have suffered a bit part of the blade is gone sorry i'd rather think about it again uh i am missing an item wait what am i missing is it still locked firmly locked a wardrobe okay what am i missing an item nothing in the bed

1818
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:46,150
Nothing on the table that I can grab.

1819
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:48,050
Can I...

1820
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:52,030
I wish I could see.

1821
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:55,030
I can't see anything.

1822
01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:56,310
The keyhole is dark.

1823
01:55:56,690 --> 01:55:57,490
The keyhole is dark.

1824
01:55:58,550 --> 01:56:01,870
Wouldn't it make sense to push something through the keyhole then, huh?

1825
01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:06,090
I feel.

1826
01:56:07,070 --> 01:56:10,730
We use the painting to remove the nail on the wall.

1827
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:11,530
Oh, wait.

1828
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:13,290
can look at it.

1829
01:56:15,650 --> 01:56:15,650
This?

1830
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:16,810
That's a nail.

1831
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:17,870
That is a nail.

1832
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:19,330
Oh my god.

1833
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:23,890
What?

1834
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:25,550
The painting?

1835
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:26,850
Oh.

1836
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:28,490
Wow.

1837
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:32,810
Can't do anything without the key.

1838
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:36,650
Oh my god.

1839
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:37,090
Wait.

1840
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:40,190
No, I would only scratch everything.

1841
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:44,610
So it's not sticking the nail through underneath.

1842
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:45,710
Okay, wait.

1843
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:50,390
What can I combine this with the bone?

1844
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:51,350
That won't help either.

1845
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:55,870
I was going to say, like, to stick up under there and knock it down, but...

1846
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:56,710
I should think about it.

1847
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:57,070
Hmm.

1848
01:56:57,590 --> 01:56:58,390
Nothing's happening.

1849
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:01,430
Wait, keep trying this?

1850
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:06,110
No, I would... No, no, no, I would only scratch everything.

1851
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:07,790
Oh!

1852
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:08,950
Oh, there it is!

1853
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:09,490
Okay, okay.

1854
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:11,010
No, not a chance.

1855
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:11,650
Uh...

1856
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:13,650
That's the canvas I detached from the picture.

1857
01:57:13,850 --> 01:57:15,670
This is the frame of the picture I took down.

1858
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:17,850
I can't see any connection there.

1859
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:18,670
Okay, hold on.

1860
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:20,750
We're brain plastic somehow?

1861
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:23,490
No, no, no, no!

1862
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:27,690
Um, okay, so we took this out.

1863
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:29,670
I don't believe it will work like that.

1864
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:32,030
I'd rather think about it again.

1865
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:35,930
That would be stupid.

1866
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:39,010
This puzzle is the worst one.

1867
01:57:40,150 --> 01:57:41,650
Please trust to use the nail on the floor.

1868
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:43,870
I... I... I...

1869
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:44,770
What the?

1870
01:57:46,870 --> 01:57:50,610
Why is he letting me do it now and didn't let me do it two seconds ago?

1871
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:52,790
Oh, that sound is terrible.

1872
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:54,910
Oh, I hate that.

1873
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:55,910
Wait, why now?

1874
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:04,400
What?

1875
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:15,670
What was that?

1876
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:22,640
God, somebody's screaming out there in the forest.

1877
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,620
It's a specific pixel.

1878
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:26,360
Oh my god, no way.

1879
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,380
What the hell's going on out there?

1880
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,660
I have to get out of here.

1881
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:33,800
I have to get out of here.

1882
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:35,480
We have witness dinner ready.

1883
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:40,260
Okay.

1884
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,340
Now, what, do we scoop this or...

1885
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:47,300
Uh, did we bucket it?

1886
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:49,240
It won't work like that.

1887
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:49,740
Okay.

1888
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,380
What was the point of...

1889
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:54,460
Wait, oh, now I can use the nail to not...

1890
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:56,440
No, I would only scratch everything.

1891
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,020
I'm just saying you don't scratch anything anymore.

1892
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:03,720
Okay, so we undid this for some reason.

1893
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:10,570
Uh-huh.

1894
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:17,140
No, I would only scratch everything.

1895
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:19,120
Of course.

1896
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:20,980
It can't work like that.

1897
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:23,700
Okay.

1898
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:26,820
There's a slit under the door.

1899
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:27,980
Uh-huh.

1900
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,160
Now do I like...

1901
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:59,170
hmm that doesn't work okay so I pushed I'm trying to see how it could push the key I think there's something in it on the other side maybe this they would have surprised me if it had worked like that push it I should think about it again can we turn on the light I wish huh

1902
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:40,370

1903
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:42,050
before I use this, I'm going to save again.

1904
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:44,770
We're on to Minto 10, everybody.

1905
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:47,730
Oh, a key.

1906
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:55,960
I guess that makes sense.

1907
02:00:56,100 --> 02:01:00,100
I guess maybe the slit under the door was not big enough for his hand to go through or something, so.

1908
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:07,810
There we go.

1909
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:08,330
It's locked.

1910
02:01:08,610 --> 02:01:09,490
It's locked.

1911
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:11,330
What about here?

1912
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:15,130
It's locked.

1913
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:16,010
Oh, yeah.

1914
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:18,810
Okay.

1915
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:22,190
It's locked.

1916
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:23,250
It's locked.

1917
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:25,030
Everything is locked.

1918
02:01:25,370 --> 02:01:25,670
It's locked.

1919
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:26,370
It's locked.

1920
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:26,870
A door.

1921
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:29,650
No idea where it leads to.

1922
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:30,250
It's locked.

1923
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:31,070
It's locked.

1924
02:01:31,110 --> 02:01:32,290
Mito's always a 10.

1925
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:32,870
Ah!

1926
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:35,450
It's locked.

1927
02:01:35,730 --> 02:01:35,890
Okay.

1928
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:37,410
Are we going downstairs then?

1929
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,820
Let's go, baby.

1930
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,160
Where can I go?

1931
02:01:46,180 --> 02:01:46,900
Can we go?

1932
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,760
It seems we can check this door.

1933
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,820
Oh, we don't even need to check the door.

1934
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:54,580
Oh, okay, here we go.

1935
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:56,460
So can we go...

1936
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:57,220
We can go this way.

1937
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:58,720
We can go...

1938
02:01:58,720 --> 02:01:59,760
This is probably locked.

1939
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:01,960
It's locked.

1940
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:03,320
I have to find the back door.

1941
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:04,080
A door?

1942
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:06,000
This is the one we just checked.

1943
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:07,300
Oh, wait, what's over here?

1944
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:11,860
Look at this Resident Evil mansion.

1945
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:16,160
Oh, this is Resident Evil based.

1946
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:35,180

1949
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:53,580
The food!

1950
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:55,740
A weird picture.

1951
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:57,900
Is it supposed to be a storm?

1952
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:02,140
What do I need to remember how many trees there are or something?

1953
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:05,500
Poop.

1954
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:07,240
Earth and a shovel.

1955
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:09,720
Hmm.

1956
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:12,840
Oh wow, this one's nice.

1957
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,640
An old castle by the sea.

1958
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,640
Wow, wow, this is nice.

1959
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:21,980
A torrential river.

1960
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:53,880
sure the dinner table is laid for a dinner for six people yes anything I can take here the dinner table is laid for a dinner for six people six people okay oh there's more to observe over here this looks important that seems to be a pictogram but I don't know what it's supposed to mean River and campfire.

1961
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:54,660
Hang on.

1962
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:57,020
Haven't I seen this symbol before?

1963
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:59,900
It's the same as the one on the amulet of the Lord of the Castle.

1964
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,120
It was!

1965
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:02,740
Look at that guy.

1966
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:05,020
Wait, look at this tiny little guy!

1967
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:05,720
Aw.

1968
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:06,960
Uh-oh.

1969
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,620
Wait, there's more.

1970
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:10,820
Grab the silverware.

1971
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:11,860
What's that?

1972
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:14,840
Seems to be a pictogram, but I don't know what it's supposed to mean.

1973
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:15,680
Not the rhino.

1974
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:18,520
It seems to be a pictogram, but I don't know what it's supposed to mean.

1975
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,120
Interesting, interesting.

1976
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:22,840
Can I?

1977
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:23,220
Oh, wait.

1978
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:26,800
The dinner table is laid for a dinner for six people.

1979
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:27,420
For six?

1980
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,200
How many people do you think are going to be at this dinner?

1981
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:30,540
Uh-oh.

1982
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:34,400
Hey, what the?

1983
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:37,860
Yay!

1984
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,320
Yeah!

1985
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:45,060
Oh, my God.

1986
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:46,020
Oh, my God.

1987
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:30,210
Shut up.

1988
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:31,310
Oh, my God.

1989
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:35,790
He keeps going.

1990
02:05:40,500 --> 02:06:35,580
no way the plating the plating though well Mr. Halligan I don't believe I have introduced you to the gentleman of my club yet this is General Myers of the British Army next to him is Bishop Stevenson wow the Earl of Sutcliffe one of the Queen's closest advisors the queen my mom the gentleman sitting beside you is mr smothers of the worldwide foods corporation oh and hear me I'm sure you're curious to learn what our club is all about what is going on I would suggest you have a bite to eat first you look pale what is happening you see mr.

1991
02:06:35,640 --> 02:07:11,240
Halligan you must know we have following your investigations into these shall we say deaths in London for some time I expect your experience in the park will have convinced you that we are to a certain degree responsible for these incidents we're just chowing down notice the meat we are eating at this meal has a rather unique flavor it is It doesn't care.

1992
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:12,060
Keeps on chewing.

1993
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:14,960
This flesh is the source of life force.

1994
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,800
It grants us strength and power.

1995
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:24,160
You will soon discover the incomparable feeling of power for yourself.

1996
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:24,600
Wait, what?

1997
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:29,480
It will be grander than any feeling you have ever felt.

1998
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,620
Very soon now.

1999
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:36,920
The day of the ritual's completion has come, our power will be...

2000
02:07:37,860 --> 02:08:09,540
Then it will be time for the curse That will put an end to the wretched hustle and bustle of this world And make rules for something grand and new A world ruled by druids World ruled by druids I must admit your investigations had us worried for a moment Mr. Halligan We had even made plans to put a stop to them By arranging a little Actually Once you are a very lucky man When you fry it real quick It's a great day yourself.

2001
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:13,100
And you will be there on the right side.

2002
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:16,180
My man has only had pits all his life.

2003
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:22,300
Welcome to the circle, Mr. Halligan.

2004
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:28,820
What?

2005
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,820
Were we brainwashed?

2006
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:32,200
What happened?

2007
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:51,740
The key...

2008
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:52,500
Right there?

2009
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:55,820
My goodness, music.

2010
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:00,000
Gosh, her eyelashes.

2011
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:01,840
What's the routine, sis?

2012
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:10,180
Welcome to the Patriots, Helgen!

2013
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:11,060
No!

2014
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:13,740
You let Clementine eat human meat.

2015
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:15,280
Me and Wild.

2016
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:16,580
Why is...

2017
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:23,160
Why are the games I'm playing recently have so much human meat consumption lately?

2018
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:26,500
What's...

2019
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,520
For zombies?

2020
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:31,420
The zombie the cannibalism pipeline, maybe.

2021
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:42,800
Um, is that still on fire over here?

2022
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,100
Wait, are we playing as a babe now?

2023
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:52,220
They didn't kill him, did they?

2024
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:53,500
No.

2025
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:56,280
Cannibalism is in this season.

2026
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:06,200
They just...

2027
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:07,560
Wait, they just left...

2028
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,060

Just pretending to be a cannibal.

02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:35,340
Wouldn't you?

2042
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:40,140
For the sake of the world!

2043
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,300

What are you doing here?

2049
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:02,600
I'm preparing dinner.

2050
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:04,840
You're having dinner with Lord Sinclair.

2051
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:06,680
That bastard got me locked in here.

2052
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:07,340
I want to see what happens though.

2053
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:09,380
I really don't want to have dinner with someone like that.

2054
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:10,740
You're not being asked.

2055
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:11,240
What?

2056
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:12,320
Mr. Halligan?

2057
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:14,140
Is everything all right with you?

2058
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:15,540
Come with me, Miss Turner.

2059
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:16,280
Where?

2060
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:17,520
Into the garden.

2061
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:19,560
I have to prepare dinner.

2062
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:20,800
In the garden?

2063
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:24,060
Mr. Halligan, what are you talking about?

2064
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:25,420
What's wrong with you?

2065
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:28,600
With me, Miss Turner, dinner will be ready soon.

2066
02:13:28,740 --> 02:13:29,240
Oh, my God.

2067
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,280
And you will be our guest of honor.

2068
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:32,820
Oh, my God.

2069
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:41,220
The skeletonized body of Dr. Melanie Turner was found in a forest near London only a few days after this conversation.

2070
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:46,760
Detective Brent Halligan has been listed as missing.

2071
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,940
He was last seen leaving his Scotland Yard department.

2072
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:55,560
Game!

2073
02:13:58,420 --> 02:13:59,020
Over!

2074
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:06,580
Okay, so I'm guessing I have to, like, distract them with the rocks.

2075
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:08,400
Okay, hold on.

2076
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:09,120
Oh, geez.

2077
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:09,980
Wait, okay.

2078
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:11,360
Load game.

2079
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:13,300
Minto 11.

2080
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:15,700
Okay.

2081
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,720
All right.

2082
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,800
Text is so anticlimactic.

2083
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:28,780
Okay.

2084
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,320
So funny.

2085
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:30,960

2086
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:45,490

2088
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:12,080
I have to go through the whole thing.

2089
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:15,460
Oh, my gosh.

2090
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:16,280
Okay.

2091
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:18,400
Just to push.

2092
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:19,740
How did they know?

2093
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:20,760
How did they know?

2094
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:21,960
Okay.

2095
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,320
Hey, um...

2096
02:15:27,650 --> 02:15:28,930
It's so funny.

2097
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:31,830
Chill Sloth.

2098
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:32,650
Welcome back.

2099
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:33,630
Thank you so much.

2100
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:34,010
Thank you.

2101
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:34,590
Thank you.

2102
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:37,230
Uh, okay.

2103
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:37,850
All right.

2104
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:39,470
Here we go.

2105
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:39,970
Load.

2106
02:15:41,610 --> 02:16:12,370

2107
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:22,140
I can throw them at the other bush.

2108
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:24,580
Oh, wait.

2109
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:29,360
What did that do?

2110
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:32,860
Oh?

2111
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:36,480
Oh, my goodness.

2112
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:37,680
Thank you guys for the donuts.

2113
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:38,140
I go!

2114
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:42,160
Every time it's made been skeletonized.

2115
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:46,080
Remains were found in her computer chair after watching this ending 400 times.

2116
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,760
Thank you so much for the gifted.

2117
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,180
It did nothing, yeah.

2118
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:55,560
And I can't throw it at him.

2119
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:57,360
I can throw it at him.

2120
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:03,000
Throw it at one of the windows.

2121
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:04,260
No.

2122
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:11,060
I still can't throw it at him.

2123
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:20,840
I don't want to just waste them, you know what I mean?

2124
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:24,220
Like, since we have to go through such a castle too.

2125
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:29,500
So I don't want to just try again with throwing it.

2126
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:35,740
Is it like a pixel perfect?

2127
02:17:35,980 --> 02:17:36,200
No?

2128
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:36,840
Well.

2129
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:40,920
Maybe I was like too low on the body.

2130
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:43,340
You know.

2131
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:46,900
Lure them to the other bush.

2132
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:47,880
It doesn't do anything.

2133
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:51,040
Unless I have to wait for him to like come by.

2134
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:53,880
Like.

2135
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:54,520
Like.

2136
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:55,400
Now.

2137
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,360
Stop right there.

2138
02:18:01,550 --> 02:18:02,290
Hey.

2139
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:03,170
Okay.

2140
02:18:03,350 --> 02:18:03,830
What is that?

2141
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:05,810
Leave me alone, you bastards.

2142
02:18:06,330 --> 02:18:07,370
Oh, man.

2143
02:18:07,910 --> 02:18:08,330
What are you?

2144
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:11,650
Stop.

2145
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:14,250
You are violated the law.

2146
02:18:14,470 --> 02:18:17,130
That's how I feel about when I hear this.

2147
02:18:20,490 --> 02:18:20,930
Ah.

2148
02:18:22,910 --> 02:18:23,650
.

2149
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:25,150
.

2150
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:25,850
.

2151
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:36,710
Don't you need to sneak to the other bush?

2152
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:41,450
I might have to, but I tried that before and he still saw me, though.

2153
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:45,540
Let me out of here.

2154
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:46,560
Let me out of here.

2155
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:47,960
Let me out of here.

2156
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:48,840
Oh, there we go.

2157
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:49,120
Okay.

2158
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:50,780
Load game.

2159
02:18:56,760 --> 02:18:57,000
Run.

2160
02:18:57,460 --> 02:18:57,800
Stop.

2161
02:18:58,160 --> 02:18:59,020
Stop right there.

2162
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:03,680
Maybe it's...

2163
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:04,600
There was not great.

2164
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:08,660
Okay.

2165
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:10,780
I'll take the help.

2166
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:32,360
Use the rock in the left bush in front when they're both facing their backs.

2167
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:35,520
Bush on the left.

2168
02:19:36,060 --> 02:19:36,560
Okay.

2169
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:41,080
Okay.

2170
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:44,040
Okay.

2171
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:44,560
Okay.

2172
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:45,120
Okay.

2173
02:19:46,060 --> 02:19:48,620
Okay, I think.

2174
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:52,820
Bush on the left.

2175
02:19:56,350 --> 02:19:56,650
Wait, huh?

2176
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:57,350
Wait.

2177
02:19:58,410 --> 02:19:59,190
This?

2178
02:20:00,010 --> 02:20:01,510
Wait, this?

2179
02:20:02,930 --> 02:20:04,630
This bush right here?

2180
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:13,680
Or is this hitting him?

2181
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:15,080
I can't tell.

2182
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:17,580
Yes.

2183
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:21,930
Okay, hold on.

2184
02:20:23,530 --> 02:20:26,710
Okay, he does kind of keep his back turned for quite a bit, so.

2185
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:29,390
All right, sorry.

2186
02:20:30,210 --> 02:20:33,970
I should have done it when...

2187
02:20:33,970 --> 02:20:36,050
But I was waiting for what his timing was.

2188
02:20:38,530 --> 02:20:39,110
All right.

2189
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:48,510
What was that?

2190
02:20:48,670 --> 02:20:49,450
Let's have a look.

2191
02:21:00,430 --> 02:21:00,950
No rush.

2192
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:04,490
Literal no sense of an urgency.

2193
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:05,070
We're fine.

2194
02:21:08,070 --> 02:21:08,550
Stop.

2195
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:09,890
Right there!

2196
02:21:10,630 --> 02:21:12,030
What did I do?!

2197
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:17,420
Hey!

2198
02:21:18,060 --> 02:21:18,780
Leave me alone!

2199
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:22,840
What happened?!

2200
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:39,100
Was she too- I don't understand what the issue was!

2201
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:47,630
If you don't wait behind the second bush, they get you anyway.

2202
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:48,970
Is that really what it was?

2203
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:57,390
Because I went- I clicked on the second bush first, and then I saw that there was like the way to- I have to do it twice.

2204
02:21:59,730 --> 02:22:00,170
Sorry.

2205
02:22:01,710 --> 02:22:01,710
Wait.

2206
02:22:02,350 --> 02:22:02,770
Oh, oops.

2207
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:05,170
I was trying to...

2208
02:22:05,170 --> 02:22:06,290
Okay, okay, okay.

2209
02:22:07,150 --> 02:22:08,630
Oh my gosh!

2210
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:17,090
What was that?

2211
02:22:17,230 --> 02:22:17,810
Let's have a look.

2212
02:22:20,750 --> 02:22:21,270
Okay.

2213
02:22:22,990 --> 02:22:24,910
So hide in the second bush first.

2214
02:22:29,370 --> 02:22:30,930
So now do I throw it again?

2215
02:22:36,530 --> 02:22:37,730
Nothing to be seen.

2216
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:39,330
Oh my gosh, the game is not paused.

2217
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:40,270
Stop right there.

2218
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:50,660
Hey, what is that?

2219
02:22:50,820 --> 02:22:51,380
Leave me alone.

2220
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:56,700
Okay, so you have to stop in the bush and then go.

2221
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,640
Oh my god.

2222
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:06,840
Dark Souls Appointing, good game.

2223
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:10,720
Go to the second bush, and then once you are there at that bush, you go to the window.

2224
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:11,880
Okay, that's...

2225
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:13,280
Okay, that's...

2226
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:16,080
Okay, okay, okay.

2227
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:24,360
We'll get it this time, folks.

2228
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:26,180
We'll get it this time.

2229
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:28,900
Oh, my gosh.

2230
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:33,860
Okay, load.

2231
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:35,980
This.

2232
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:37,640
Get the rocks.

2233
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:40,060
And throw.

2234
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:44,340
What was that?

2235
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:45,060
Let's have a look.

2236
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:47,960
I'm, like, traumatized by the...

2237
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:49,400

2241
02:25:58,470 --> 02:25:59,130
I guess that's true.

2242
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:00,970
You're making them dance.

2243
02:26:01,330 --> 02:26:03,310
They're like stabbing him and then we stab the next.

2244
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:04,390
Oh, wait.

2245
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,280
I did something.

2246
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:13,860
I think.

2247
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:15,560
I heard it.

2248
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:16,980
Did you guys hear it?

2249
02:26:17,240 --> 02:26:17,940
Something happened.

2250
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:21,660
Oh!

2251
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:22,680
Oh!

2252
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:33,060
Okay.

2253
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:40,770
Oh, I'm a genius?

2254
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:41,490
Yahoo!

2255
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:43,930
Whoa!

2256
02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:45,670
Oh,

2257
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:49,550
okay.

2258
02:26:50,350 --> 02:26:50,790
Oh, dang it.

2259
02:26:50,890 --> 02:26:51,930
I didn't mean to press it again.

2260
02:26:57,030 --> 02:26:59,510
I'll put some rocks on it.

2261
02:26:59,770 --> 02:27:00,170
Dang it.

2262
02:27:00,230 --> 02:27:01,290
She says the same thing.

2263
02:27:02,890 --> 02:27:04,370
Well, this rub is so freaky.

2264
02:27:05,970 --> 02:27:07,670
Are these skulls real?

2265
02:27:07,990 --> 02:27:08,670
Looks like it.

2266
02:27:08,750 --> 02:27:09,570
I think so.

2267
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:12,890
Oh, gosh.

2268
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:13,450
Okay.

2269
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:14,910
Oh, what's in here?

2270
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:44,890
bone soup bones these are definitely human bones nope okay bone soup anything else okay so how do I don't know what this is for we could take this and put it in how can I take this heavy thing with me you could knock somebody out with that and then

2271
02:27:49,490 --> 02:27:51,330
just show the symbols again.

2272
02:27:51,610 --> 02:27:52,810
Maybe we need to remember.

2273
02:27:55,050 --> 02:28:03,290
Up River, Campfire, Three, Sideways River.

2274
02:28:05,770 --> 02:28:10,690
Up River, Campfire, Sideways River, Three.

2275
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:22,910
His desk looks expensive and weird somehow.

2276
02:28:22,970 --> 02:28:24,580
What did this solve, though?

2277
02:28:30,030 --> 02:28:31,170
Not quite sure.

2278
02:28:33,970 --> 02:28:35,830
Can it only go one way?

2279
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:37,310
You're absurd.

2280
02:28:38,710 --> 02:28:42,030
After Zanzibar, Turner's skeletonized body was found.

2281
02:28:45,070 --> 02:28:46,930
Air, fire, earth, water.

2282
02:28:47,070 --> 02:28:48,250
Oh, you're right, maybe.

2283
02:28:58,660 --> 02:28:59,240
Brute force?

2284
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:01,720
Brute force?

2285
02:29:13,390 --> 02:29:14,330
You want this?

2286
02:29:14,350 --> 02:29:15,030
Is it a safe code?

2287
02:29:15,330 --> 02:29:15,630
Yeah.

2288
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:17,210
Oh, I can!

2289
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:17,590
Okay.

2290
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:20,770
Wait.

2291
02:29:21,530 --> 02:29:22,690
Sometimes it...

2292
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:25,950
Sometimes it goes other way and sometimes it goes, you know?

2293
02:29:27,150 --> 02:29:28,950
So wait, is this the one first?

2294
02:29:33,310 --> 02:29:35,470
Code is 1016.

2295
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:36,090
Thank you!

2296
02:29:38,490 --> 02:29:42,850
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2297
02:29:45,650 --> 02:29:46,570
How do I...

2298
02:29:46,570 --> 02:29:47,590
Sometimes I don't know how...

2299
02:29:47,590 --> 02:29:48,290
Okay, so 10.

2300
02:29:49,330 --> 02:29:50,590
Wait, or is this 10?

2301
02:29:51,670 --> 02:29:53,110
Because it does a little click.

2302
02:29:55,390 --> 02:29:57,150
So does this count as one...

2303
02:29:57,150 --> 02:29:58,630
Wait, this one?

2304
02:29:59,590 --> 02:30:00,030
No.

2305
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:07,300
Okay.

2306
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:08,520
Oh, it's like a clock.

2307
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:13,120
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2308
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:14,700
But it's not really.

2309
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:16,560
Okay.

2310
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:18,200
Dang it!

2311
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:21,480
Oh, it is a clock.

2312
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:23,300
Oh, I'm still counting wrong.

2313
02:30:28,510 --> 02:30:29,030
Hehehe.

2314
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:31,830
Okay.

2315
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:38,790
Voila!

2316
02:30:40,270 --> 02:30:44,370
This is the amulet of transformation Mr. Blake talked about.

2317
02:30:44,570 --> 02:30:47,070
It seems to be really important for Lord Sinclair.

2318
02:30:47,390 --> 02:30:47,510
Yeah!

2319
02:30:48,450 --> 02:30:49,250
And the thing.

2320
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:50,250
What is this?

2321
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:52,470
The parchment is full of runes.

2322
02:30:53,850 --> 02:30:55,750
I can't read a single word.

2323
02:30:56,370 --> 02:30:57,960
Well, maybe Mr. Blake can read it.

2324
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:01,870
What's happening?

2325
02:31:02,670 --> 02:31:02,870
Ah!

2326
02:31:08,310 --> 02:31:08,810
No!

2327
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:12,330
Mr. Halligan, God, what a relief.

2328
02:31:14,110 --> 02:31:15,490
Oh, what was that?

2329
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:19,590
Why are you hitting me?

2330
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:20,930
Who are you?

2331
02:31:21,250 --> 02:31:22,390
What are you doing here?

2332
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:25,090
Oh, my God, stop it!

2333
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:26,270
What's the matter with you?

2334
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:27,690
Don't you recognize me?

2335
02:31:28,050 --> 02:31:28,610
Oh, my God!

2336
02:31:31,330 --> 02:31:32,470
Oh my god!

2337
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:34,370
He just keeps slapping her!

2338
02:31:35,150 --> 02:31:35,870
Get it!

2339
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:39,350
Use the skull to knock him out!

2340
02:31:41,410 --> 02:31:41,910
Yeah.

2341
02:31:44,010 --> 02:31:46,030
Rand, you bloody idiot.

2342
02:31:53,210 --> 02:31:55,190
Oh, maybe he's back to normal.

2343
02:31:58,630 --> 02:32:00,550
You think she wants to go see a movie with us?

2344
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:01,650
What happened?

2345
02:32:01,810 --> 02:32:03,430
Brent, is that you?

2346
02:32:03,630 --> 02:32:04,030
Stop yelling!

2347
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:04,870
You recognize me?

2348
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:05,530
Stop yelling, please.

2349
02:32:05,830 --> 02:32:06,750
Of course I recognize you.

2350
02:32:07,090 --> 02:32:08,590
Bloody hell, what's going on?

2351
02:32:08,810 --> 02:32:10,510
Oh my god, I'm feeling sick.

2352
02:32:11,310 --> 02:32:12,130
Everything's spinning.

2353
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:13,230
It's all the human meat.

2354
02:32:13,230 --> 02:32:13,710
I had to hit you over the head.

2355
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:15,790
You were acting like a madman.

2356
02:32:16,310 --> 02:32:19,050
Wait, I just have to get it together for a moment.

2357
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:22,310
Oh, Melanie, you can't imagine what I've gone through here.

2358
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:25,590
Wait, can I?

2359
02:32:25,890 --> 02:32:27,150
Okay, I won't let me save.

2360
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:28,910
Well, yeah.

2361
02:32:29,230 --> 02:32:30,650
How did you get here anyway?

2362
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:32,350
Have you been here long?

2363
02:32:32,610 --> 02:32:33,550
I got your message.

2364
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:34,850
Can't you remember?

2365
02:32:35,210 --> 02:32:36,930
I thought you might need help out here.

2366
02:32:37,150 --> 02:32:37,710
Oh, right.

2367
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:38,610
The copy.

2368
02:32:38,750 --> 02:32:40,410
I had a look around the room, Brent.

2369
02:32:40,630 --> 02:32:41,670
It's a little frozen.

2370
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:43,790
I found the amulet Mr. Blake mentioned on the phone.

2371
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:46,010
It was in Sinclair's safe.

2372
02:32:46,850 --> 02:32:48,030
Together with a parchment.

2373
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:49,590
So Sinclair had it.

2374
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:52,330
I'm sure Mr. Blake will be interested in that.

2375
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:54,910
But now, tell me what's been happening here, Brent.

2376
02:32:55,610 --> 02:32:57,010
What's Sinclair up to?

2377
02:32:57,050 --> 02:32:59,010
They've ruined my pizza only diet.

2378
02:33:00,670 --> 02:33:03,150
Oh, wait, what happened?

2379
02:33:03,350 --> 02:33:04,490
Wait, what?

2380
02:33:04,650 --> 02:33:05,690
What do you mean what happened?

2381
02:33:06,030 --> 02:33:06,630
What happened?

2382
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:07,850
You threatened me.

2383
02:33:08,210 --> 02:33:09,370
You tried to kill me.

2384
02:33:09,490 --> 02:33:10,790
You're not you and you're hungry.

2385
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:12,310
You tried to kill me, Brent.

2386
02:33:12,730 --> 02:33:13,410
You hit me.

2387
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:14,070
Three times.

2388
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:15,310
Don't ever do that again.

2389
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:16,170
Do you understand?

2390
02:33:16,570 --> 02:33:18,590
Melanie, I didn't know what I was doing.

2391
02:33:19,310 --> 02:33:20,870
I can't even remember hitting you.

2392
02:33:21,170 --> 02:33:22,250
Oh, God, Brent.

2393
02:33:22,410 --> 02:33:23,110
It was a triple slap.

2394
02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:24,870
What's this Sinclair done to you?

2395
02:33:25,610 --> 02:33:27,510
It wasn't even like a punch.

2396
02:33:27,610 --> 02:33:30,190
Like, any sort of like, he didn't even like shove her.

2397
02:33:30,210 --> 02:34:01,710
It was just like, like so funny Melanie I saw how this Lord Sinclair killed somebody what when did you see that and where last night here on the estate Sinclair caught me immediately after my arrival and had me locked up I could hear screams when I was in that room horrible screams yeah I escaped and ran outside to the forest behind the estate yeah there I saw it what did you see Sinclair and some other men.

2398
02:34:02,530 --> 02:34:03,610
They wore habits.

2399
02:34:03,790 --> 02:34:04,170
Habits.

2400
02:34:04,390 --> 02:34:08,330
And they were just about to cut a living human being into pieces.

2401
02:34:08,690 --> 02:34:09,030
Yes.

2402
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:10,330
With a sickle.

2403
02:34:10,350 --> 02:34:11,250
They had already done that.

2404
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:11,770
That can't be true.

2405
02:34:12,170 --> 02:34:14,270
I saw it with my own eyes, Melanie.

2406
02:34:15,090 --> 02:34:15,990
It was horrible.

2407
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:17,030
Oh, God.

2408
02:34:17,670 --> 02:34:18,890
And what happened to you?

2409
02:34:19,530 --> 02:34:21,370
Why didn't you recognize me?

2410
02:34:22,630 --> 02:34:25,170
Must have had something to do with the food.

2411
02:34:27,790 --> 02:34:30,650
So, you know, they...

2412
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,380
Wait, wait, you didn't have to eat it.

2413
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:39,680
It must have had something to do with the food.

2414
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:40,720
What food?

2415
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:43,460
Sinclair and his friends invited me to their dinner.

2416
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:45,240
The food did something to me.

2417
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:46,280
He was like, made me lose the job.

2418
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:52,000
Anyway, Sinclair had no compunction in telling me all about the circle and about their future plans over dinner.

2419
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:52,220
Wait.

2420
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:54,060
The circle wants to complete the ritual.

2421
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,100
You remember that.

2422
02:34:55,140 --> 02:34:58,180
And to put a curse on the world which will make us all their slaves.

2423
02:34:58,200 --> 02:34:58,520
Wait.

2424
02:34:58,620 --> 02:34:59,420
That's nonsense.

2425
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:00,480
No, Melanie.

2427
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:05,220
this is Dr. Melanie Turner from the Anthropological Museum in Oxford.

2428
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:06,640
Oh yes, of course.

2429
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,060
We spoke on the telephone.

2430
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:08,740
That's right.

2431
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,960
Nice to meet you at long last, Mr. Blake.

2432
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:12,440
Now, what's been happening?

2433
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,640
Have you found out any more about the circle?

2434
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:15,420
Any more?

2435
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:17,460
It's a nightmare, Mr. Blake.

2436
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:18,180
Go on.

2437
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:23,540
Okay, I want to save so badly, but...

2438
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:26,440
Mr. Blake, we found the amulet you were talking about.

2439
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:28,460
The amulet of transformation.

2440
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:29,680
You found it.

2441
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:52,680
my god show me he just gave it to you that's it where was it in a hidden safe in the office of the leader of this ominous circle there was a parchment with it with completely illegible signs on it here take a look he

2442
02:36:56,250 --> 02:37:34,570
can read it do they make any sense to you hmm very unusual runes you can't read it take a look at this in peace go on with your story you were saying you know who's leading the circle who is it the circle is led by an aristocrat named Lord Sinclair the circle is led by an aristocrat called Lord Sinclair aristocrat Lord Sinclair never heard of him how did you find out research Scotland Yard observed the group for a while there was an entry in the database so I drove out to his place it's a pretty pretentious estate on Winchester Street you drove out there all by yourself yeah that was rather careless of you mr.

2443
02:37:34,750 --> 02:37:57,450
Halligan you can say that again he'd obviously been expecting me and had me locked up at once yeah what happened next I witnessed a murder actually guys give me one second I'm gonna go grab some more water I was waiting for a chance to like save I could grab it but give me one second I'll be right back Oh,

2444
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:57,280
dokey, dokey, dokey, dokey, dokey, dokey, dokey, dokey, dokey, dokey, so much more.

2445
02:38:57,360 --> 02:38:58,940
Oh, dust, different darts.

2446
02:38:59,620 --> 02:39:02,340
I've got to take a cough drop or a throat drop.

2447
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:03,980
A throat drop.

2448
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:06,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I saw a murder.

2449
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:09,280
I witnessed a murder taking place.

2450
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:09,980
Murder?

2451
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:12,180
On Sinclair's estate?

2452
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:15,340
Yes.

2453
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:18,780
I saw them cutting the flesh from a human body.

2454
02:39:18,860 --> 02:39:19,200
Look at that.

2455
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:19,660
Thank you.

2456
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:53,260
body with a sickle yes i knew it what you witnessed was a ritual for the transferal of life force were you seen i passed out when i came to i was sitting at a laid table with sinclair and four other men was there food on the table yes meat you didn't eat any surely yes i did i suppose i know it was the victim's flesh wasn't it yes i did you have taken part in the ritual mr How on earth did you manage to get away?

2457
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,480
Ms. Turner got me out.

2458
02:39:55,240 --> 02:39:57,080
If it hadn't been for her, I wouldn't be here now.

2459
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,880
You're a brave woman, Ms. Turner.

2460
02:39:59,100 --> 02:40:00,320
Yeah, she's awesome.

2461
02:40:00,660 --> 02:40:01,440
What do we do now?

2462
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:04,220
Why don't we just send a police contingent round there?

2463
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:08,100
You're a detective, Mr. Halligan, and Lord Sinclair is a murderer.

2464
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:10,820
There won't be anything to find by the time they get there.

2465
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:12,820
Sinclair and his friends are no fools.

2466
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:15,740
They'll proceed as they've done in all the other cases.

2467
02:40:15,940 --> 02:40:22,320
They'll just dump the bones somewhere to save the police hunting high and low for a Scutland Yard will file it away.

2468
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:23,600
End of case.

2469
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:26,200
That's all for now.

2470
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:27,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2471
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:29,780
But I saw them commit murder!

2472
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,040
But I saw them commit murder.

2473
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:33,560
Yes, you're a witness.

2474
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:37,360
A simple detective up against five highly influential citizens.

2475
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:39,000
Who'd believe you?

2476
02:40:39,320 --> 02:40:40,400
You don't stand a chance.

2477
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:45,700
The way we're all just standing here.

2478
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:48,120
Okay.

2479
02:41:00,940 --> 02:41:02,540
How can we stop these people?

2480
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:04,240
I'm afraid we won't be able to.

2481
02:41:04,740 --> 02:41:06,780
Lord Sinclair and his friends are untouchable.

2482
02:41:07,360 --> 02:41:09,620
And every one of their rituals makes them more powerful.

2483
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:10,180
You don't even know him.

2484
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:15,300
Have you found out yet what stopped the completion of the ritual 1,000 years ago?

2485
02:41:15,740 --> 02:41:21,020
I've deciphered the text a little further, but some of the signs are just completely unknown to me.

2486
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:25,740
I thought you said the amulet was important to the ritual.

2487
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:26,160
Yeah.

2488
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:28,080
Yes, that's what the inscription says.

2489
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:29,760
But then everything's all right now.

2490
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:31,480
After all, I've got it.

2491
02:41:32,680 --> 02:41:34,560
then this nightmare will be over.

2492
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:38,500
Mr. Halligan, you're forgetting the ritual has already taken place.

2493
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:42,140
1,000 years ago, it just didn't reach perfection.

2494
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:45,800
Only part of the power was transferred to the infants.

2495
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:49,720
The inheritors are now trying to complete their ritual.

2496
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:53,900
But if this amulet means so much to Sinclair, surely it must be needed for the perfection.

2497
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:55,540
I'm not so sure about that.

2498
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:58,920
Sinclair may be interested in it for some other reason.

2499
02:41:59,040 --> 02:41:59,960
What makes you think that?

2500
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:02,380
The title written on the parchment you gave me.

2501
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:04,400
What does it say?

2502
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:06,560
What does the parchment's title say?

2503
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:12,480
Unless I'm very much mistaken, the text refers to a place known as Twelve Bridges.

2504
02:42:12,780 --> 02:42:13,820
What kind of place is that?

2505
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:17,600
Twelve Bridges is an abandoned complex near Glastonbury.

2506
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:20,140
The bridges are in great danger of collapsing.

2507
02:42:20,780 --> 02:42:24,660
Ancient Celtic myths refer to the place as the Gate of the Worlds.

2508
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:25,660
Gate of the Worlds?

2509
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:27,660
Yeah, we could still melt it down just to be sure.

2510
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:33,740
You know, Mr. Heligan, the Celts did not regard reality and time insurmountable facts.

2511
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:41,860
On the contrary, they regarded them as illusions, which man's laziness and ignorance made him incapable of overcoming.

2512
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:48,280
Celtic shrines were always special places that allowed them to leave the normality of everyday reality.

2513
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:58,140
Celtic myths claim that 12 bridges has been a consecrated site for millennia, a place where the body can step over into another time.

2514
02:42:59,140 --> 02:43:01,560
Uh oh, this is getting kind of wackadoo.

2515
02:43:03,100 --> 02:43:05,020
Can you read what the parchment says?

2516
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:08,660
The signs resemble those on the inscription I'm working on.

2517
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:11,000
But I'm just not getting anywhere with it.

2518
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:14,460
All I've been able to make out of the parchment so far is the title.

2519
02:43:14,820 --> 02:43:16,860
I need a special book to continue.

2520
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:20,760
The Celtic Orthographic System by Scott M.

2521
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:21,240
Winfield.

2522
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:24,300
Oxford University Library should have it.

2523
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:24,520
Okay.

2524
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:27,360
Mr. Halligan, please get me a copy of that book.

2525
02:43:27,400 --> 02:43:27,900
We can do that.

2526
02:43:28,020 --> 02:43:31,800
I believe the translation of this parchment is the key to Lord Sinclair's intentions.

2527
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:34,680
Perfect, we'll go do that.

2528
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:38,580
But nothing's ever been reported of such a journey.

2529
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:41,160
Nothing's ever been reported of such a journey.

2530
02:43:41,480 --> 02:43:43,320
Well, that doesn't make it impossible, does it?

2531
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:46,820
The place has not been closely examined so far.

2532
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:48,040
It's too dilapidated.

2533
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:49,080
She has no thoughts.

2534
02:43:49,100 --> 02:43:51,540
Entering the place is taking a very serious risk.

2535
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:55,080
Anyway, nobody really believes in time travel anymore these days.

2536
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:57,720
Nah, nobody believes in time travel anymore.

2537
02:43:57,980 --> 02:43:58,380
Geez!

2538
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:02,400
Wait, this might be, if there's time travel, this might become my favorite game ever.

2539
02:44:03,880 --> 02:44:06,300
Why do they call the place 12 bridges?

2540
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:09,500
It's a very strange arrangement of 12 stone bridges.

2541
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:12,220
No one knows why they were built that way.

2542
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:15,100
They probably weren't the first thing that was erected there anyway.

2543
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:18,640
The current bridge array dates from the early Middle Ages.

2544
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:25,920
If, as I suspect, that place has been a Celtic shrine for centuries, there are bound to have been other structures there at some point.

2545
02:44:28,700 --> 02:44:31,340
Why would Sinclair keep a parchment about that place?

2546
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:31,820
She hasn't blinked.

2547
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:32,320
She hasn't done anything.

2548
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:35,400
Mr. Halligan, that's what I've been wondering.

2549
02:44:35,780 --> 02:44:45,220
If Sinclair knows the place and keeps a parchment about it hidden in his safe, wouldn't it be conceivable that journeys through time really are possible from 12 bridges?

2550
02:44:45,380 --> 02:44:47,960
You mean he wants to travel back in time?

2551
02:44:48,340 --> 02:44:51,640
Well, he'd certainly be doing his best to make sure nobody else made that journey.

2552
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:57,180
Maybe Sinclair wants to prevent anyone from traveling back in time and disturbing the ritual.

2553
02:44:57,640 --> 02:44:58,800
Why would anyone do that?

2554
02:44:59,420 --> 02:45:01,520
And why would Sinclair be so concerned about it?

2555
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:03,160
It's easy.

2556
02:45:03,860 --> 02:45:04,360
No ritual.

2557
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:05,660
No inheritors.

2558
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:06,880
No inheritors.

2559
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:09,520
No Lord Sinclair.

2560
02:45:10,700 --> 02:45:11,420
I see.

2561
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:11,820
Yeah.

2562
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:13,720
Of course, these are just speculations.

2563
02:45:14,660 --> 02:45:18,320
As I said, Mr. Halligan, we need the book from the library.

2564
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:21,500
I should be able to tell you more when I've translated the parchment.

2565
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:23,960
Thank you, Mr. Blake.

2566
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:24,720
Thank you, Mr. Blake.

2567
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:26,160
I'll see what I can make of it.

2568
02:45:26,380 --> 02:45:26,620
Good.

2569
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:28,180
We have to go take care of Melanie now.

2570
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:30,660
If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to call on me.

2571
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:31,680
Anytime you like.

2572
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:42,800
okay oh she's fine are you okay okay all these are for the books all right let's keep going

2573
02:45:46,340 --> 02:46:33,000
oh this thing is getting more and more mysterious i can't believe what mr blake said i need to find out why this amulet is so important to sinclair perhaps mr blake is right the amulet is the key to preventing the ritual i expect we'll know more as soon as the finished i have to go to oxford melanie i have to get the book for mr come with me yes of course that's fine by me i really need to check a few things at home where shall we meet later i'll get in touch with you as soon as i have any news okay all right i'll be off then okay melanie see you later i don't think it's good to split up i don't think that's a good idea all right what are we at mental 14 maybe okay oh we saved oh we don't have to go through all that i will ever again.

2574
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:33,960
Awesome.

2575
02:46:34,620 --> 02:46:36,020
Love it.

2576
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:39,800
Never be skeletonized again.

2577
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:44,920
Oxford Library.

2578
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:47,280
Whoa.

2579
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:50,020
A sculpture of a unicorn.

2580
02:46:50,400 --> 02:46:51,580
Not quite to my taste.

2581
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:53,200
Nobody asked.

2582
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,280
What's over there?

2583
02:46:58,920 --> 02:46:59,580
This is it.

2584
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:01,440
Oxford University Library.

2585
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:08,540

Snail!

2589
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:17,820
An old book.

2590
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:19,720
It's bound to be valuable.

2591
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,780
I'm pretty sure this isn't the book, Blake meant.

2592
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:23,480
Okay.

2593
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:26,120
Wait, is the one that he did mean?

2594
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:28,280
Is it going to be in this glass?

2595
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:29,000
Oh, gosh.

2596
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:31,760
I'm pretty sure this isn't the book, Blake meant.

2597
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:33,880
An old illustrated book.

2598
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:37,580
Let's go ask the desk.

2599
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:38,360
Oh, my gosh.

2600
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:39,840
Thank you for another 20!

2601
02:48:41,100 --> 02:48:42,260
Engineer, thank you.

2602
02:48:42,360 --> 02:48:43,140
Thank you so much.

2603
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:48,200
Hello, hello, hello.

2604
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:51,060
Excuse me, I'm looking for a book.

2605
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:53,140
Oh, how nice for you.

2606
02:48:53,420 --> 02:48:53,640
Quite.

2607
02:48:54,220 --> 02:48:55,480
Do you think you could help me?

2608
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:56,140
Help you?

2609
02:48:56,680 --> 02:48:56,940
Why?

2610
02:48:57,420 --> 02:48:57,640
Oh.

2611
02:48:59,680 --> 02:49:00,640
Uh, why?

2612
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:01,340
Why?

2613
02:49:01,880 --> 02:49:03,900
As I said, I'm looking for a book.

2614
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:05,560
I heard what you said.

2615
02:49:05,900 --> 02:49:07,020
You're looking for a book.

2616
02:49:07,300 --> 02:49:07,580
Yeah?

2617
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:08,720
So, go ahead and look.

2618
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:11,240
Aren't you not the librarian?

2619
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:12,700
The music's so nice here.

2620
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:17,900
Yeah, isn't it your job?

2621
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:20,340
Librarian to help me?

2622
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:23,160
I thought it was your job to give people like me information.

2623
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:25,680
Don't think you can tell me what my job is.

2624
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:27,220
It was an obvious question.

2625
02:49:27,700 --> 02:49:31,880
Look, young man, my job is to answer questions the computer can't answer.

2626
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:33,660
Have you asked the computer yet?

2627
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:37,400
Actually, I'm no...

2628
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:37,960
No.

2629
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:40,360
No.

2630
02:49:40,820 --> 02:49:43,860
Well, then, go to the computer and check the database.

2631
02:49:45,360 --> 02:49:45,840
Hmm.

2632
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:48,820
I'll see what I can do by myself, then.

2633
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:49,820
You do that.

2634
02:49:50,500 --> 02:49:51,780
Everybody's so mean here.

2635
02:49:54,380 --> 02:49:54,860
Okay.

2636
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:58,520
We BGM to Animal Crossing Museum, BGM.

2637
02:50:00,480 --> 02:50:01,220
What's this book?

2638
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:04,220
Oh my gosh, there's so many areas to visit in here.

2639
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:06,380
An old book written with a quill pen.

2640
02:50:06,460 --> 02:50:08,280
I'm reasonably sure this isn't the book.

2641
02:50:08,560 --> 02:50:09,800
Okay, what about this one?

2642
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:16,400
Somehow I don't think this is the book Blake was talking about.

2643
02:50:17,240 --> 02:50:18,980
It's so cute though.

2644
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:21,980
I'm pretty sure this is an old book.

2645
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:27,800
I like these statues of like these super skinny women.

2646
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:29,360
Okay.

2647
02:50:30,260 --> 02:50:32,640
Oh, Mr. I need the computer right now.

2648
02:50:33,580 --> 02:50:34,360
Excuse me, sir.

2649
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:37,120
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

2650
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:37,480
Hmm.

2651
02:50:38,720 --> 02:50:40,680
You know whose car that is outside?

2652
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:42,860
Do you know whose car that is outside?

2653
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:44,180
Out in the forecourt?

2654
02:50:44,820 --> 02:50:45,380
That's my car.

2655
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:46,880
That's how we get him off the computer.

2656
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:48,540
Oh my god.

2657
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:58,320
We're going to get him off the computer by breaking into his car and making the car alarm go off.

2658
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:05,580
I think a couple of students have damaged the paintwork.

2659
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:06,300
Hmm.

2660
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:11,480
Are you trying to get me to go out there so that you can perhaps get to the computer?

2661
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:15,320
Not bad, young man, but I've been working here for 30 years now.

2662
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,420
of youngsters trying to pull the wool over my eyes.

2663
02:51:19,700 --> 02:51:22,800
You'll have to come up with something better than that to fool me.

2664
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:28,900
Oh, why don't you go, uh, don't say I didn't warn you.

2665
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:30,080
Oh, well, it's up to you.

2666
02:51:30,940 --> 02:51:32,320
Don't say I didn't warn you.

2667
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:33,240
Mm-hmm, uh-huh.

2668
02:51:33,820 --> 02:51:34,220
Whatever.

2669
02:51:34,580 --> 02:51:36,040
I'm staying right here.

2670
02:51:37,320 --> 02:51:38,160
Why don't you go sit for yourself?

2671
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:39,640
Why don't you go out and see for yourself?

2672
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:41,640
Don't talk nonsense, young man.

2673
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:44,060
Our students wouldn't do that sort of thing.

2674
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:46,260
It could be anybody.

2675
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:47,660
to walk up.

2676
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:48,560
I'm not a student.

2677
02:51:49,700 --> 02:51:51,800
I love that Minto is starting to think like Halligan.

2678
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:53,780
Oh, well.

2679
02:51:54,140 --> 02:51:55,080
That's all right, then.

2680
02:51:55,880 --> 02:51:56,300
Okay.

2681
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:01,440
Now what can I use?

2682
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:03,100
A ladder for reaching the top rows.

2683
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:06,840
What can I use to...

2684
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:07,380
A table.

2685
02:52:08,100 --> 02:52:10,600
A stute observation, Halligan.

2686
02:52:11,140 --> 02:52:13,400
To make his car go off.

2687
02:52:14,580 --> 02:52:15,220
What's this?

2688
02:52:15,620 --> 02:52:16,360
Which one?

2689
02:52:16,720 --> 02:52:17,020
That one.

2690
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:19,080
They don't seem to be sorted by author.

2691
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:19,760
This one.

2692
02:52:20,060 --> 02:52:21,300
The one that's highlighted.

2693
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:22,280
This one.

2694
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:23,180
That one.

2695
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:26,500
They don't seem to be sorted by author.

2696
02:52:26,940 --> 02:52:27,560
Which one?

2697
02:52:29,060 --> 02:52:29,740
A table.

2698
02:52:34,360 --> 02:52:35,480
Which one?

2699
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:37,040
Maybe there's another computer.

2700
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:39,360
There's gotta be more than one computer, right?

2701
02:52:41,620 --> 02:52:42,740
Which one?

2702
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:44,420
The book.

2703
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:47,020
The book, the book.

2704
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:47,560
the book.

2705
02:52:48,380 --> 02:52:49,000
What are these?

2706
02:52:51,620 --> 02:52:52,660
What is this?

2707
02:52:53,060 --> 02:52:53,820
Oh, okay.

2708
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:54,580
It's mine.

2709
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:55,340
That's the book.

2710
02:52:55,620 --> 02:52:59,340
The Roman monetary system and fiscal policies must be a best seller.

2711
02:52:59,900 --> 02:53:00,960
Why did we take it?

2712
02:53:04,480 --> 02:53:07,580
I don't understand this man at all.

2713
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,260
Which one?

2714
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:13,120
Which one?

2715
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:13,480
Really?

2716
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:15,180
There's only one computer?

2717
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:20,260
with a library of this size.

2718
02:53:21,880 --> 02:53:25,600
I know that we're like, what, in the 90s, but come on.

2719
02:53:28,220 --> 02:53:29,240
Which one?

2720
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:31,520
Wolf.

2721
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:34,260
This place is humongous.

2722
02:53:42,930 --> 02:53:44,370
Which one?

2723
02:53:46,930 --> 02:53:47,410
Which?

2724
02:53:47,530 --> 02:53:49,050
There must be thousands of books in here.

2725
02:53:49,210 --> 02:53:49,610
I know.

2726
02:53:50,070 --> 02:53:50,470
Crazy.

2727
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:59,570
um over here all the way over here i'm just exploring at this point then i'll go back outside

2728
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:16,740
okay nothing nothing here let's go okay this guy's car is so cooked

2729
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:28,400
wait oh i was like what happened i thought he got on the ground for a second So I have this book.

2730
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:30,960
Oh my god, there's people up here!

2731
02:54:31,320 --> 02:54:32,540
That does not look safe.

2732
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:35,940
That looks extremely unsafe even.

2733
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:42,560
I say stop right there.

2734
02:54:43,060 --> 02:54:43,500
What's the matter?

2735
02:54:43,940 --> 02:54:45,700
Don't you dare act the innocent.

2736
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:47,940
You're trying to steal that book.

2737
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:49,020
Who, me?

2738
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:50,380
Steal a book?

2739
02:54:50,820 --> 02:54:52,060
Madam, I'm a detective.

2740
02:54:52,520 --> 02:54:53,660
They're always the worst.

2741
02:54:54,100 --> 02:54:55,220
Anyway, I can see it.

2742
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:59,200
If you want to borrow a book, be good enough to come over to my desk.

2743
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:01,760
Okay, this one.

2744
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:03,380
Oh, um, this one?

2745
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:05,180
There must be some mistake.

2746
02:55:05,740 --> 02:55:07,400
I was lost in thought, you see.

2747
02:55:07,560 --> 02:55:09,120
It must have slipped into my pocket.

2748
02:55:09,380 --> 02:55:09,700
This guy?

2749
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:13,220
Just how often do you think I've heard that one?

2750
02:55:13,260 --> 02:55:13,860
He's such a pathological liar.

2751
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:17,380
I'll put the book back and be grateful that I'm not having you thrown out.

2752
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:19,420
Why is he such a...

2753
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:20,620
Why is...

2754
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:22,680
He's such a pathological liar.

2755
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:23,860
He's such a freak.

2756
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:27,460
Oh my gosh.

2757

I thought maybe throwing it over the alarm.

2771
02:56:53,320 --> 02:56:55,060
Let's see if that's what we need to do.

2772
02:56:56,620 --> 02:56:57,060
Oh, wait.

2773
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:01,800

Well, of all the...

2776
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:10,160
Young man, if you're looking for trouble, you're going the right way about it.

2777
02:57:10,580 --> 02:57:12,160
Okay, calm down.

2778
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:13,340
My mistake.

2779
02:57:13,600 --> 02:57:14,840
Lord, give me strength.

2780
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:16,300
What a nerve.

2781
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:19,120
Um...

2782
02:57:20,970 --> 02:57:22,870
You need help?

2783
02:57:26,470 --> 02:57:27,490
Try again.

2784
02:57:27,630 --> 02:57:29,050
Let's try one more time.

2785
02:57:36,350 --> 02:57:37,930
Well, of all the...

2786
02:57:37,930 --> 02:57:38,310
No.

2787
02:57:38,510 --> 02:57:41,950
Young man, if you're looking for trouble, you're going the right way about it.

2788
02:57:42,210 --> 02:57:44,210
Okay, calm down.

2789
02:57:44,610 --> 02:57:45,430
My mistake.

2790
02:57:45,710 --> 02:57:46,870
Lord, give me strength.

2791
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:48,330
What a nerve.

2792
02:57:50,870 --> 02:57:51,670
Um...

2793
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:55,920
Let's see.

2794
02:57:58,840 --> 02:58:00,020
Wait a second.

2795
02:58:01,860 --> 02:58:02,400
No.

2796
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:05,140
Do you want the book, mister?

2797
02:58:07,660 --> 02:58:09,180
Do you want it?

2798
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:10,920
Oh.

2799
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:27,200
We're framing him for the crime Oh

02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:42,190
my We're framing him We're really We're doing this Go

2801
02:58:48,230 --> 02:59:27,370
Brent Halligan Ruinner of all lives I can't believe this I can't believe this guy he's actually so insane um now i i thought maybe i would like throw the book in there or something and cause the alarm to go up but actually i'm not quite sure um no i would only scratch everything oh that's our big problem right now scotland yard's finest You need a key item that I don't have.

2802
02:59:27,790 --> 02:59:29,030
Oh, okay.

2803
02:59:30,370 --> 02:59:30,950
All right.

2804
02:59:33,170 --> 02:59:34,470
Is it here?

2805
02:59:37,290 --> 02:59:39,710
I need to go back all the way to the Sinclair's hedges.

2806
02:59:39,990 --> 02:59:41,170
And take a piece of wire!

2807
02:59:43,330 --> 02:59:43,910
I do!

2808
02:59:44,470 --> 02:59:46,670
I'm not gonna get killed going back here.

2809
02:59:48,570 --> 02:59:49,470
Why do I...

2810
02:59:49,470 --> 02:59:51,330
When was I supposed to pick up the wire?

2811
02:59:53,630 --> 02:59:57,850
I kind of get why that woman at the police station didn't want to go out with him.

2812
02:59:59,430 --> 02:59:59,970
Yeah.

2813
03:00:01,410 --> 03:00:03,490
Wait, how do I...

2814
03:00:05,490 --> 03:00:06,890
How do I grab it?

2815
03:00:10,200 --> 03:00:11,240
Bottom right.

2816
03:00:11,720 --> 03:00:12,040
Oh, wait.

2817
03:00:21,690 --> 03:00:22,890
Holy moly.

2818
03:00:32,830 --> 03:00:35,270
You guys, weeks of entertainment.

2819
03:00:37,730 --> 03:00:39,710
anyone beat this game?

2820
03:00:40,910 --> 03:00:47,710
How did anybody beat this?

2821
03:00:49,970 --> 03:00:50,530
Weeks!

2822
03:00:51,010 --> 03:00:51,570
Weeks!

2823
03:00:51,570 --> 03:00:52,410
Years even!

2824
03:00:53,630 --> 03:00:54,970
I can't do that.

2825
03:00:55,190 --> 03:00:55,530
Yes, you can.

2826
03:00:56,790 --> 03:00:57,090
Wait.

2827
03:00:58,150 --> 03:00:59,090
There we go.

2828
03:01:00,930 --> 03:01:02,190
Wee-woo, wee-woo, wee-woo.

2829
03:01:05,770 --> 03:01:08,330
What are we... Oh, my God.

2830
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:19,560
Oh, thank goodness.

2831
03:01:19,780 --> 03:01:26,880
Oh, they have enough sense to Professor Hastings, what are you doing?

2832
03:01:27,580 --> 03:01:27,580
Who?

2833
03:01:28,040 --> 03:01:28,220
Me?

2834
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:28,980
Nothing.

2835
03:01:29,340 --> 03:01:30,500
I must be off to my car.

2836
03:01:30,780 --> 03:01:32,020
My alarm just went off.

2837
03:01:32,460 --> 03:01:34,320
Professor, what's that book you're carrying?

2838
03:01:34,820 --> 03:01:35,060
Book?

2839
03:01:35,440 --> 03:01:36,180
I don't have a book.

2840
03:01:36,280 --> 03:01:36,480
Book?

2841
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:38,280
Please don't joke now, Mrs. Owen.

2842
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:40,200
I have to see to my car.

2843
03:01:40,420 --> 03:01:41,200
What's this then?

2844
03:01:41,580 --> 03:01:45,160
But how the devil... that's impossible.

2845
03:01:45,480 --> 03:01:46,940
I didn't take this book.

2846
03:01:47,180 --> 03:01:48,600
Then how did it get there?

2847
03:01:48,940 --> 03:01:50,460
There must be some mistake.

2848
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:52,380
A very regrettable mistake.

2849
03:01:52,400 --> 03:01:54,540
I assure you...

2850
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:56,960
I like your nerve, Professor Hastings.

2851
03:01:57,400 --> 03:02:00,700
You steal a book and then try to deny the whole thing ever happened.

2852
03:02:01,300 --> 03:02:03,280
I'm very disappointed in you.

2853
03:02:03,960 --> 03:02:07,720
Mrs. Owen, you've known me for 20 years now.

2854
03:02:08,020 --> 03:02:09,920
You ought to know that I've never...

2855
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:13,500
All I know is that I'm going to have to put this on record.

2856
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:16,280
Please come along over here to the Ishing counter, Professor.

2857
03:02:16,720 --> 03:02:18,220
You will have to fill in a form.

2858
03:02:19,240 --> 03:02:21,740
Oh my god, he's so sad.

2859
03:02:23,360 --> 03:02:24,240
destroying lives.

2860
03:02:24,780 --> 03:02:25,000
Where?

2861
03:02:25,240 --> 03:02:27,480
This is going on his permanent record!

2862
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:29,320
Anyway.

2863
03:02:32,920 --> 03:02:37,680
If you did this without him holding the book, he would have caught you breaking into his car and Halligan gaslights him super hard.

2864
03:02:37,840 --> 03:02:39,440
Reload to save if you want to see.

2865
03:02:41,180 --> 03:02:42,500
Uh, no, it's okay.

2866
03:02:44,440 --> 03:02:45,900
That sounds crazy.

2867
03:02:46,320 --> 03:02:47,300
I should save, though.

2868
03:02:47,460 --> 03:02:48,180
I should save.

2869
03:02:49,420 --> 03:02:50,300
Save game.

2870
03:02:51,400 --> 03:02:52,380

2881
03:04:17,450 --> 03:04:18,710
Wait, let's go back out.

2882
03:04:24,300 --> 03:04:25,560
Doesn't have...

2883
03:04:42,820 --> 03:04:43,580
Do you see it?

2884
03:04:43,640 --> 03:04:46,800
I don't see anything anywhere.

2885
03:04:56,470 --> 03:04:58,010
Two digits means second floor.

2886
03:04:59,310 --> 03:04:59,890
Wait, really?

2887
03:05:01,970 --> 03:05:04,710
I know this guy is stressing me out a little bit.

2888
03:05:06,990 --> 03:05:07,710
Can we go upstairs?

2889
03:05:07,950 --> 03:05:11,190
It's, unless it's not roped off anymore, we couldn't.

2890
03:05:14,650 --> 03:05:16,970
Yeah, see, we can't even go upstairs, you guys.

2891
03:05:25,030 --> 03:05:29,930
Maybe, what was the biggest room was this one, maybe?

2892
03:05:31,930 --> 03:05:35,790
There was ladders, right?

2893
03:05:40,470 --> 03:05:41,970
I don't think that's,

2894
03:05:46,190 --> 03:05:48,450
wait, here?

2895
03:05:51,890 --> 03:05:53,710
They don't seem to be sorted by author.

2896
03:05:55,470 --> 03:06:00,090
It's not, let's go to that one area, Okay, hold on.

2897
03:06:01,190 --> 03:06:04,810
There was one where that book was, like, suspiciously highlighted.

2898
03:06:05,330 --> 03:06:06,390
It could be that one.

2899
03:06:12,390 --> 03:06:14,190
Wait, bookshelf C, middle section.

2900
03:06:16,970 --> 03:06:18,550
Like, I know I was at C.

2901
03:06:19,130 --> 03:06:20,370
But am I at 48?

2902
03:06:28,790 --> 03:06:30,730
Is it, like, a pixel perfect something?

2903
03:06:31,930 --> 03:06:34,350
Oh, oh, now he uses the ladder.

2904
03:06:34,490 --> 03:06:36,690
Oh, my gosh, I tried to get him to use it before!

2905
03:06:39,870 --> 03:06:41,610
Ah, wow, that's a hefty book.

2906
03:06:41,790 --> 03:06:42,270
Oh, okay.

2907
03:06:42,570 --> 03:06:44,150
Slip into...

2908
03:06:45,350 --> 03:06:47,090
What a cool guy!

2909
03:06:48,730 --> 03:06:49,610
Oh, okay.

2910
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:51,910
I guess I got it.

2911
03:06:52,930 --> 03:06:53,290
Interesting.

2912
03:06:56,110 --> 03:06:56,670
What the hell?

2913
03:06:58,310 --> 03:06:59,550
Ma'am, help me, please.

2914
03:06:59,610 --> 03:07:00,750
I would like to check out this book.

2915
03:07:03,050 --> 03:07:03,930
You again.

2916
03:07:04,290 --> 03:07:05,450
Haven't you found your book yet?

2917
03:07:05,850 --> 03:07:06,170
No.

2918
03:07:06,410 --> 03:07:06,590
Wait!

2919
03:07:06,590 --> 03:07:07,210
How could I?

2920
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:09,510
Look, I'd really appreciate your helping me.

2921
03:07:09,870 --> 03:07:11,490
You repeat yourself, young man.

2922
03:07:13,410 --> 03:07:13,770
Huh?

2923
03:07:14,370 --> 03:07:15,890
Wait, no, no, oh, maybe I have to...

2924
03:07:15,890 --> 03:07:16,930
Oh, wait, okay, I have to...

2925
03:07:16,930 --> 03:07:19,690
I thought it was your job to give people like me information.

2926
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:22,190
Don't think you can tell me what my job is.

2927
03:07:22,550 --> 03:07:23,750
It was an obvious question.

2928
03:07:24,190 --> 03:07:28,450
Look, young man, my job is to answer questions the computer can't answer.

2929
03:07:28,850 --> 03:07:30,230
Have you asked the computer yet?

2930
03:07:31,130 --> 03:07:32,130
Okay, hold on.

2931
03:07:32,510 --> 03:07:33,990
I tried to exit out.

2932
03:07:34,730 --> 03:07:35,370
Exit, okay.

2933
03:07:35,690 --> 03:07:37,190
Now I do this.

2934
03:07:37,350 --> 03:07:37,990
Okay, here we go.

2935
03:07:38,370 --> 03:07:38,910

2938
03:08:39,450 --> 03:08:40,210
What do I do?

2939
03:08:42,370 --> 03:08:43,220
Run for it.

2940
03:08:50,390 --> 03:08:51,550
Minto 17.

2941
03:08:52,970 --> 03:08:54,030
I like that movie.

2942
03:08:55,090 --> 03:08:55,790
Here we go.

2943
03:08:56,810 --> 03:08:57,210
Run.

2944
03:08:57,610 --> 03:08:57,850
Run.

2945
03:08:58,170 --> 03:08:58,550
Run.

2946
03:08:59,050 --> 03:08:59,290
Run.

2947
03:09:04,480 --> 03:09:06,460
Well, of all the...

2948
03:09:06,460 --> 03:09:10,080
Young man, if you're looking for trouble, you're going the right way about it.

2949
03:09:10,400 --> 03:09:10,580
Run!

2950
03:09:10,700 --> 03:09:12,260
Okay, calm down.

2951
03:09:12,740 --> 03:09:13,500
My mistake.

2952
03:09:13,580 --> 03:09:15,040
Lord, give me strength.

2953
03:09:15,620 --> 03:09:16,500
What a nerve.

2954
03:09:18,020 --> 03:09:18,220
Okay.

2955
03:09:18,660 --> 03:09:20,600
How do I copy all this down then?

2956
03:09:25,320 --> 03:09:25,820
Hmm.

2957
03:09:27,440 --> 03:09:30,740
Can I get one of the sad students to do it for me?

2958
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:33,340
Wait, how do I...

2959
03:09:33,340 --> 03:09:35,340
How do I write all this down?

2960
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:36,060
For real.

2961
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:38,920
No, no.

2962
03:09:40,220 --> 03:09:40,720
Wait.

2963
03:09:44,760 --> 03:09:45,260
Hmm.

2964
03:09:50,310 --> 03:09:52,350
I think you steal it.

2965
03:09:58,100 --> 03:09:58,820
Oh, you're back.

2966
03:09:59,360 --> 03:10:00,240
It's your car, okay?

2967
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:01,280
Hello, Professor.

2968
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:02,200
Still busy.

2969
03:10:02,940 --> 03:10:04,880
I thought maybe you'd been thrown out by now.

2970
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:05,660
Hmm?

2971
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:06,800
Hang on.

2972
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:07,780
Nearly finished.

2973
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:08,640
It's pointless.

2974
03:10:09,220 --> 03:10:10,480
He's in a world of his own.

2975
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:14,260
Let's see.

2976
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:14,660
Okay.

2977
03:10:19,460 --> 03:10:20,500
Can we...

2978
03:10:20,500 --> 03:10:21,080
Hmm.

2979
03:10:22,020 --> 03:10:22,180
Right.

2980
03:10:22,200 --> 03:10:23,460
Wrap it up as evidence.

2981
03:10:25,880 --> 03:10:26,520
This is official.

2982
03:10:26,740 --> 03:10:28,040
I thought it wouldn't work like that.

2983
03:10:28,100 --> 03:10:28,420
Dang it.

2984
03:10:28,500 --> 03:10:29,460
This is official business.

2985
03:10:30,380 --> 03:10:31,680
That won't help either.

2986
03:10:32,200 --> 03:10:34,480
Uh, can we cut out the pages?

2987
03:10:34,700 --> 03:10:35,840
Looks like that won't work.

2988
03:10:36,080 --> 03:10:36,340
Okay.

2989
03:10:36,580 --> 03:10:37,220
Or this one.

2990
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:38,200
No way.

2991
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:39,300
No way.

2992
03:10:39,500 --> 03:10:39,740
Okay.

2993
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:45,180
Maybe.

2994
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:49,180
That won't get me any further.

2995
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:49,820
No.

2996
03:10:52,220 --> 03:10:52,700
Hmm.

2997
03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:54,320
Hmm.

2998
03:10:55,240 --> 03:10:56,840
Use the book from before.

2999
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:01,440
How would that help, though?

3000
03:11:03,220 --> 03:11:04,340
It was in this one.

3001
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:11,660
I shall combine them and see.

3002
03:11:14,840 --> 03:11:15,300
Yoink.

3003
03:11:17,260 --> 03:11:18,680
I cannot yoink it.

3004
03:11:20,620 --> 03:11:23,080
Why did we try to take this anyway?

3005
03:11:27,220 --> 03:11:27,800
Swapping.

3006
03:11:27,820 --> 03:11:28,600
out the covers.

3007
03:11:28,780 --> 03:11:31,060
Well, I can't take it anyway, so...

3008
03:11:37,720 --> 03:11:39,740
What if I damage it?

3009
03:11:41,620 --> 03:11:42,780
With my drink.

3010
03:11:42,980 --> 03:11:44,140
That's futile as well.

3011
03:11:46,140 --> 03:11:47,320
There's no point in that.

3012
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:51,340
Drag it into the pile.

3013
03:11:51,720 --> 03:11:52,240
Try.

3014
03:11:53,960 --> 03:11:56,580
Oh, so smart.

3015
03:11:56,780 --> 03:11:58,080
Use the frame to frame the profile.

3016
03:11:58,400 --> 03:12:00,560
Ah, that's how we disguise it.

3017
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:20,240
history book is a perfect fit for the book I want to borrow wait but this one will also set off the alarm no what is the logic here how to swapping the cover don't the covers have the alarms on them

3018
03:12:24,390 --> 03:12:34,630
well off oh wait I can check it out if you're looking for trouble you're going the right way about it okay calm down I got it I got it!

3019
03:12:35,050 --> 03:12:35,530
I got it!

3020
03:12:35,530 --> 03:12:36,090
I got it!

3021
03:12:36,090 --> 03:12:36,670
I got it!

3022
03:12:36,670 --> 03:12:37,110
I got it!

3023
03:12:37,710 --> 03:12:41,670
Were you guys yelling at me to say that you were like, no, we don't, don't go through the alarm!

3024
03:12:44,590 --> 03:12:45,930
This is not a reference copy!

3025
03:12:46,090 --> 03:12:47,110
No, no, no, no, no.

3026
03:12:48,510 --> 03:12:50,830
You've played two games with accidental cannibals.

3027
03:12:51,510 --> 03:12:56,070
One star is a vicious, dangerous criminal willing to break the rules to get his way, and the other star is Lee.

3028
03:12:58,650 --> 03:12:59,930
Right, I've finished here.

3029
03:13:00,370 --> 03:13:02,150
I found a different book that interests me.

3030
03:13:02,470 --> 03:13:04,270
I assume you'll let me borrow this one.

3031
03:13:04,590 --> 03:13:05,130
We'll see.

3032
03:13:05,570 --> 03:13:06,470
checking it out.

3033
03:13:06,810 --> 03:13:08,030
Solve this, the logic is stupid.

3034
03:13:08,110 --> 03:13:09,430
No, no, this one actually makes sense.

3035
03:13:09,630 --> 03:13:12,370
Oh, the Roman monetary system and fiscal policies.

3036
03:13:13,110 --> 03:13:14,570
Yes, you may borrow this one.

3037
03:13:15,050 --> 03:13:17,550
And just think, I've actually read this one.

3038
03:13:18,070 --> 03:13:18,810
What a coincidence.

3039
03:13:19,030 --> 03:13:21,390
It's because they have so many copies of this one.

3040
03:13:21,690 --> 03:13:21,950
Very vivid.

3041
03:13:22,090 --> 03:13:23,430
It's not a reference copy.

3042
03:13:24,030 --> 03:13:25,750
That's why swapping the covers is okay.

3043
03:13:26,530 --> 03:13:28,770
And Roman coins were my special field.

3044
03:13:29,190 --> 03:13:31,530
But then I met my husband here at the university.

3045
03:13:32,210 --> 03:14:17,090

Please run.

3050
03:14:43,780 --> 03:14:44,580
There we go.

3051
03:14:44,740 --> 03:14:44,860
Okay.

3052
03:14:46,800 --> 03:14:48,540
Oh, yeah, baby!

3053
03:14:49,620 --> 03:14:51,240
Now steal the car.

3054
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:53,480
Okay, now let's go back to Mr. Blake.

3055
03:14:56,540 --> 03:14:57,720
He's alive, right?

3056
03:14:58,100 --> 03:14:59,020
He's still alive.

3057
03:14:59,460 --> 03:15:00,020
He's here.

3058
03:15:00,340 --> 03:15:01,400
He's alive and well.

3059
03:15:01,840 --> 03:15:02,680
Blake, open the door.

3060
03:15:02,880 --> 03:15:04,780
It's not going to be Ricky Martin.

3061
03:15:05,560 --> 03:15:06,540
Ask her to the cinema.

3062
03:15:07,360 --> 03:15:07,880
Okay.

3063
03:15:11,210 --> 03:15:11,610
Okay.

3064
03:15:18,070 --> 03:15:18,850
Here you are.

3065
03:15:19,270 --> 03:15:20,690
Here's the book you asked for.

3066
03:15:20,930 --> 03:15:21,530
Ah, yes.

3067
03:15:21,750 --> 03:15:22,470
Don't mind the cover.

3068
03:15:23,830 --> 03:15:24,670
Thank you, Mr. Halligan.

3069
03:15:24,870 --> 03:15:25,130
You're welcome.

3070
03:15:25,430 --> 03:15:28,190
Well, did you have any difficulties with Mrs. Owen at the issuing counter?

3071
03:15:28,590 --> 03:15:29,610
None I couldn't handle.

3072
03:15:29,910 --> 03:15:30,150
Good.

3073
03:15:30,510 --> 03:15:31,570
I'll get to work at once.

3074
03:15:31,870 --> 03:15:33,730
Oh, by the way, Mr. Halligan.

3075
03:15:34,170 --> 03:15:36,090
Miss Turner called about an hour ago.

3076
03:15:36,370 --> 03:15:36,390
Miss Turner!

3077
03:15:36,430 --> 03:15:40,010
She's worried about you because you haven't been in touch for such a long time.

3078
03:15:40,130 --> 03:15:41,230
The way his arms.

3079
03:15:41,330 --> 03:15:41,530
Yes.

3080
03:15:41,850 --> 03:15:44,070
She said she needs to speak to you urgently.

3081
03:15:44,090 --> 03:15:45,690
Do you mind if I use your phone?

3082
03:15:46,070 --> 03:15:46,410
No need.

3083
03:15:46,670 --> 03:15:48,370
I asked her to come out here and join me.

3084
03:15:48,710 --> 03:15:50,690
She should be arriving any minute now.

3085
03:15:51,330 --> 03:15:52,410
Any minute now?

3086
03:15:53,150 --> 03:15:54,270
Oh my god!

3087
03:15:54,490 --> 03:15:56,030
Sorry, the music just...

3088
03:15:56,030 --> 03:15:57,530
How long will the translation take?

3089
03:15:58,010 --> 03:15:59,090
Oh, not long, I hope.

3090
03:15:59,990 --> 03:16:01,110
The book will be a great help.

3091
03:16:01,390 --> 03:16:03,250
You'd better just wait here for a moment.

3092
03:16:03,550 --> 03:16:05,630
I'll just take a look around then, if you don't mind.

3093
03:16:05,990 --> 03:16:06,550
Of course not.

3094
03:16:06,890 --> 03:16:07,470
Be my guest.

3095
03:16:09,330 --> 03:16:12,850
Be our guest, be our guest.

3096
03:16:13,470 --> 03:16:13,690
Oh!

3097
03:16:14,090 --> 03:16:14,830
That was so fast.

3098
03:16:15,610 --> 03:16:16,910
Mr. Halligan, there you are.

3099
03:16:17,490 --> 03:16:19,290
I've been looking everywhere for you.

3100
03:16:20,590 --> 03:16:26,350
I don't know if you've seen Amazing World of Gunball, but there's a scene where Darwin turned into a ghost as I can finally do this and kiss his carry.

3101
03:16:26,950 --> 03:16:27,810
Yeah, that's me.

3102
03:16:31,830 --> 03:16:33,330
What do you mean by that?

3103
03:16:36,710 --> 03:16:38,470
I'm touched at your concern.

3104
03:16:38,910 --> 03:16:40,390
I'm touched at your concern.

3105
03:16:40,790 --> 03:16:42,390
Now, don't go imagining things.

3106
03:16:44,090 --> 03:16:46,270
that I should be worried about you and mr.

3107
03:16:46,350 --> 03:16:48,810
Blake she's really not into us at all and mr.

3108
03:16:49,090 --> 03:16:51,270
Blake well I had to get him well I had to get mr.

3109
03:16:51,410 --> 03:17:44,650
Blake this book that took rather a long time I've been phoning around asking for you you've been trying to get hold of me yes I also went to Scotland Yard and spoke to your chief he's a bit cross with you cross with me why what have I done now Lord Sinclair's planning to bring charges against you for burglary what I don't believe it that old devil Sinclair seems to feel he's pretty safe doesn't he he looks that way seems he has very influential friends in the police force whatever your chief asked me to tell you that you're suspended effective immediately oh and the next time you come to the office he expects you to give him a comprehensive report in writing what he can't be serious don't tell he's handing the case back to that thick-headed big-mouthed Lowry.

3110
03:17:45,070 --> 03:17:45,710
I wouldn't know.

3111
03:17:46,290 --> 03:17:50,050
All he said was that he expects you to hand the fire to him as soon as you get back to the yard.

3112
03:17:50,510 --> 03:17:51,770
I certainly will not.

3113
03:17:52,470 --> 03:17:54,590
This business is just too important to let go.

3114
03:17:54,990 --> 03:17:56,310
I don't care what the chief says.

3115
03:17:57,110 --> 03:17:59,090
I'm gonna carry this case through on my own.

3116
03:18:00,610 --> 03:18:01,430
Oh, what's happening?

3117
03:18:01,890 --> 03:18:02,370
A cutscene?

3118
03:18:03,050 --> 03:18:04,610
What's going on out there?

3119
03:18:06,270 --> 03:18:07,190
What's happening?

3120
03:18:07,430 --> 03:18:07,610
Oh.

3121
03:18:08,890 --> 03:18:09,770
What is it?

3122
03:18:09,870 --> 03:18:10,610
What's happening?

3123
03:18:11,250 --> 03:18:14,890
Oh my god, we almost got smushed by that clock.

3124
03:18:15,110 --> 03:18:16,830
Leave me, get out of the danger zone.

3125
03:18:17,530 --> 03:18:18,910
Here, take the parchment and go.

3126
03:18:19,070 --> 03:18:19,890
The danger zone?

3127
03:18:19,970 --> 03:18:20,910
Come along, Mr. Blake.

3128
03:18:21,330 --> 03:18:22,210
Let's get out of here.

3129
03:18:23,050 --> 03:18:24,130
You get out of here.

3130
03:18:24,610 --> 03:18:25,450
I'll follow you.

3131
03:18:28,990 --> 03:18:30,050
Wait, what's happening?

3132
03:18:31,370 --> 03:18:32,310
Get out of here.

3133
03:18:32,830 --> 03:18:33,670
Quickly, run!

3134
03:18:33,690 --> 03:18:34,910
What's the danger zone?

3135
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:46,700
I believe you have to.

3136
03:18:46,720 --> 03:18:49,080
something of mine, Mr. Hannigan.

3137
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:54,260
I shall give you until sunset to give my property back to me.

3138
03:19:00,980 --> 03:19:01,700
What just happened?

3139
03:19:05,020 --> 03:19:06,340
What just happened?

3140
03:19:12,810 --> 03:19:14,470
Why was the house shaking?

3141
03:19:15,090 --> 03:19:15,950
Was it a tank?

3142
03:19:16,410 --> 03:19:18,390
And now we're just standing here, staring at it.

3143
03:19:18,570 --> 03:19:19,050
Oh, God!

3144
03:19:19,350 --> 03:19:19,970
Mr. Blake!

3145
03:19:20,630 --> 03:19:22,130
I have to go back and get him out of there.

3146
03:19:22,330 --> 03:19:23,130
Are you crazy?

3147
03:19:23,410 --> 03:19:49,110
Don't it's pointless you can't help him anymore he's dead yeah you're right oh my god let's get out of here Melanie otherwise we'll be next where can we go to Scotland yard no that's not a good idea the chief inspector's waiting for me there we'd only lose time and Sinclair is getting more and more powerful with each new murder so what can we do you heard what mr.

3148
03:19:49,110 --> 03:20:20,610
Blake said Sinclair has the power to complete the ritual no matter what we do for the time being nobody can fireball no melanie we have one chance left what do you mean we have to go to 12 bridges we have to try to move the gate of the world's if we want to stop time travel we have to stop those who gave him his power a thousand years ago you believe in that gate of the world's thing it's just a myth a fairy tale we just saw a fireball blow up this guy's house the question is

3149
03:20:23,870 --> 03:20:47,010
come on then oh my god whoa what the hell is this structure what oh my this is this is just out here in the open oh my god two

3150
03:20:51,070 --> 03:21:03,170
thirds way through the game yippee yeah i was thinking probably calling it here but let's we're at caution danger oh my god

3151
03:21:07,320 --> 03:21:26,240
this place is just incredible yes it's beautiful but also rather ramshackle just like mr blake told us why is my game like this um okay let's have a look around There we go.

3152
03:21:30,460 --> 03:21:30,940
Wee!

3153
03:21:32,080 --> 03:21:33,240
Mr. Blake!

3154
03:21:34,020 --> 03:21:36,300
I called his death like five times.

3155
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:38,400
I was like, this guy's gonna die!

3156
03:21:38,980 --> 03:21:40,000
He's gonna die!

3157
03:21:41,740 --> 03:21:42,480
Let's see.

3158
03:21:43,080 --> 03:21:44,040
12 doors.

3159
03:21:44,440 --> 03:21:45,160
Is that what it's called?

3160
03:21:45,260 --> 03:21:45,780
12 doors?

3161
03:21:46,340 --> 03:21:47,420
We'll just save it as that.

3162
03:21:48,660 --> 03:21:49,260
My goodness.

3163
03:21:51,160 --> 03:21:53,900
I did not give them the rights to use the likeness of my house.

3164
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:58,380
Do you think my house would sell for a lot if I built one of these in the backyard?

3165
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:01,000
I think honestly, everyone could.

3166
03:22:02,300 --> 03:22:03,680
The music is so whimsical.

3167
03:22:07,020 --> 03:22:08,300
Every British town has one of these?

3168
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:12,380
A church, a Starbucks, and a giant chasm pit with a tower in the middle.

3169
03:22:13,300 --> 03:22:14,220
It's pretty cliche.

3170
03:22:15,260 --> 03:22:16,240
Oh, 12 gates.

3171
03:22:17,900 --> 03:22:18,180
Oops.

3172
03:22:22,080 --> 03:22:23,360
This is so beautiful.

3173
03:22:23,920 --> 03:22:24,260
Oh.

3174
03:22:29,880 --> 03:22:31,840
I didn't think anyone knew about this game.

3175
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:33,600
Well, I'm playing it.

3176
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:40,900
Oh, it's already been a crazy, crazy ride, but this has been so much fun.

3177
03:22:41,580 --> 03:22:42,500
I'm almost tempted.

3178
03:22:42,700 --> 03:22:42,960
Okay.

3179
03:22:44,580 --> 03:22:47,800
Can I beat this game instead of played Bloons this week?

3180
03:22:48,980 --> 03:22:49,760
Can I play?

3181
03:22:49,820 --> 03:22:52,860
I don't think I want to wait until when I get back.

3182
03:22:54,180 --> 03:22:55,860
I might edit my schedule.

3183
03:22:58,000 --> 03:22:59,240
I think I'll play this.

3184
03:22:59,360 --> 03:23:03,120
I think I'll beat this on Wednesday instead of playing Bloons.

3185
03:23:06,280 --> 03:23:07,720
We'll do that instead.

3186
03:23:09,520 --> 03:23:10,520
I don't want to wait until...

3187
03:23:10,520 --> 03:23:11,580
Because I would have to wait.

3188
03:23:12,400 --> 03:23:15,100
Then I'll be gone for a couple days and then...

3189
03:23:15,100 --> 03:23:17,480
I'd have to wait until after my birthday stuff.

3190
03:23:18,080 --> 03:23:20,680
And then I have a collab with...

3191
03:23:20,680 --> 03:23:21,440
Well, yeah.

3192
03:23:22,500 --> 03:23:22,900
So...

3193
03:23:22,900 --> 03:23:23,800
I want to just...

3194
03:23:23,800 --> 03:23:25,460
I just want to see what happens.

3195
03:23:27,820 --> 03:23:54,080
So we'll do that Instead of playing Bloons We will beat this game So exciting Yeah, Bloons can wait Bloons can wait Oh my gosh Collab Oh yeah, I have a collab with Doki It's been a while since she and I had just been Done a collab with She and I Bloons isn't going anywhere Yeah,

3196
03:23:54,120 --> 03:24:00,500
we gotta save the world This game has been a trip so far if you want to play similar but less insane game.

3197
03:24:01,160 --> 03:24:03,120
Broken Sword Shadow of the Templars.

3198
03:24:03,780 --> 03:24:05,160
But I love the insanity.

3199
03:24:07,340 --> 03:24:09,200
I've been laughing so much at this.

3200
03:24:09,400 --> 03:24:10,040
It's so great.

3201
03:24:10,400 --> 03:24:10,680
What?

3202
03:24:12,360 --> 03:24:12,800
What?

3203
03:24:15,360 --> 03:24:15,800
What?

3204
03:24:15,960 --> 03:24:18,060
It's my favorite point and click game of all time.

03:24:18,260 --> 03:24:18,640
Thank you, Mindo.

3206
03:24:18,820 --> 03:24:19,360
Thank you!

3207
03:24:19,900 --> 03:24:24,560
Thank you guys for all the help as well with some of these crazy obtuse puzzles.

3208
03:24:24,700 --> 03:24:25,140
Some of them!

3209
03:24:25,460 --> 03:24:29,620
I sometimes get on my own, a little bit.

3210
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,780
But, yeah, it's been so much fun.

3211
03:24:34,720 --> 03:24:37,980
And I can't wait to beat it and see what the conclusion is.

3212
03:24:38,200 --> 03:24:39,700
I'm so hyped.

3213
03:24:42,680 --> 03:24:43,900
We learned so much today.

3214
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:47,120
Arson, vandalism, trespassing, forgery, theft, cannibalism.

3215
03:24:48,640 --> 03:24:51,860
We're the best of the best to ever do it at the Scotland Yard.

3216

Have you ever heard of the game lunacy?

3219
03:25:33,320 --> 03:25:34,660
It's like this but even more scuffed.

3220
03:25:35,060 --> 03:25:36,700
I don't think so.

3221
03:25:37,920 --> 03:25:38,800
I don't think so.

3222
03:25:40,160 --> 03:25:43,330
But yeah, it's Amido.
