1
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,420
There we go.

2
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,140
Hello everybody.

3
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,980
Hello, hello.

4
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,640
Why is it so quiet?

5
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,740
I clicked out again.

6
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
That's why.

7
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,640
Hold on, I forgot to...

8
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,320
It took me a little minute.

9
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:14,760
Hold on.

10
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,380
It took me a second because I...

11
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,400
Went to go make some tea.

12
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,740
And I was getting my tea because it's in my cabinet.

13
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,660
And I heard a cat outside.

14
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
And I was like, kitty.

15
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,180
And I opened the door a little bit.

16
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,040
I was like, kitty.

17
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,300
And I see the cat run by.

18
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,360
And actually, this cat I saw yesterday.

19
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,380
And I saw this cat yesterday because Paz started...

20
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,060
So, Paz sometimes... I guess I have a lot of strays around the maid cafe.

21
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
And yesterday,

22
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,580
Paz...

23
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,960
So, Paz sometimes sees the strays.

24
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,300
And will like, yell at them from the window.

25
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,740
And so that's what she did yesterday.

26
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,820
She was just like...

27
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,840
And I was really upset.

28
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,660
And then I saw this cat again.

29
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,180
And I'm like, oh my gosh.

30
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,100
She's just running around, this little kitten.

31
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,820
And I kind of want her, but...

32
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,500
I don't think Paz likes her very much.

33
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,320
Anyway, sorry.

34
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,380
That just happened, so...

35
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
It's in my brain.

36
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,040
It's on my brain.

37
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,420
Anyway, welcome!

38
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you!

39
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeah, Paz does not want her.

40
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,580
No.

41
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,780
It's funny too, because Paz and Butaro...

42
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,600
I feel have grown even closer lately.

43
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,420
Where like, you know...

44
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,180
Where it's like...

45
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,240
They have recently started cuddling with each other.

46
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,780
Like sleeping...

47
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,100
Not cuddling, but they sleep next to each other recently.

48
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,980
And I'm like, oh my gosh.

49
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,440
It's only been a year and they are finally more friends.

50
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,700
Can't stay.

51
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,500
Oh no, Brandon!

52
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,860
I hope you feel better.

53
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,580
That's tough.

54
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,760
But thanks for the superchat.

55
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,880
Thanks for dropping by.

56
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,220
Rest up.

57
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,380
Using each other as pillows.

58
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,760
So...

60
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,780
Yeah, they've been getting closer.

61
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,900
And I feel lately even Paz has started to like me a bit more.

62
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,460
Because, you know, it's been almost a year since I've had her.

63
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,260
But only recently has she really been purring more often.

64
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,960
She took a really long time to kind of super warm up.

65
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,960
But now I feel that she has.

66
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,240
Utaro finally learned the required phrases to take her to the love box.

67
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,280
Yeah, I moved up from dislike to acceptable.

68
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,520
Yeah, I give her lots of love.

69
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,720
All the time.

70
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,220
Anytime I see her...

71
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,800
Oh my gosh, one of my favorite things about her...

72
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,300
Sorry, now I'm talking about my cat.

73
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,520
But every time I see her...

74
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,460
She'll like do a little...

75
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,820
She does like little chirpy types of meows.

76
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,280
And I can see her bottom teeth.

77
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,600
Cats have really small bottom teeth.

78
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,600
And it's so cute.

79
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,240
Is Paz still farting?

80
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:41,960
Sometimes.

81
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,980
I actually got her a new food just the other day.

82
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,580
And she pooped solids.

83
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,020
But it was like the longest poop I've ever seen.

84
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,800
It was probably like six inches of just straight poop.

85
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,880
I was like, whoa.

86
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,080
Whoa.

87
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:05,940
Yeah.

88
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,600
Impressive.

89
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,560
It was pretty.

90
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,600
I was like, dang.

91
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,320
I was so shocked.

92
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,040
That actually happened today.

93
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,200
Where I was like, whoa.

94
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,980
I was like, whoa.

95
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,820
I almost wanted to take a picture of it.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,940
It was just...

97
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,580
I've never seen anything...

98
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,040
Like it before.

99
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,060
I was like, whoa.

100
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,420
That's such a long poop.

101
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,940
Do it next time.

102
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,240
I wasn't prepared.

103
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,720
I wasn't prepared.

104
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,660
I heard her in the litter box and I turned and watched.

105
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,820
Because, you know, I like to make sure that my cats are going properly.

106
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,040
Because, you know, that's a sign of if they're not going to the bathroom.

107
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,820
It's a sign, you know, of something wrong.

108
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,600
So I like...

109
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,500
I just watched my cat's poop.

110
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,720
And I watched this.

111
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,540
I was like, whoa.

112
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,220
And then she covered it up while I was like stun-walked.

113
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,240
Because she's, you know, polite.

114
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,440
And she covers her poop.

115
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,220
Whereas Butaro is a foul sub-beast.

116
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,080
He doesn't even do that.

117
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,940
What have I stepped into here?

118
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
Six inches of what?

119
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,560
Some would say that's average, no?

120
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,780
Looking quite dorky today.

121
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,620
Oh my gosh.

122
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,260
Mika's Fries.

123
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,820
I haven't seen you in so long.

124
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,900
Hi.

125
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,000
Welcome back.

126
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,380
DMC Netflix tomorrow.

127
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,960
Do I have to get Netflix?

128
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,700
I don't want to.

129
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,340
But I got Apple TV for severance.

130
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,280
Maybe I'll...

131
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,980
Is it gonna be a bingeable series?

132
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,220
Can I binge it and then cancel, I wonder.

133
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,960
I'd wait until you're done with games.

134
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,340
You know what?

135
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,560
True.

136
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,280
True.

137
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,140
I think I'll wait until I'm done.

138
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,400
And also once I've heard what people...

139
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,060
But even if people say something, usually I still want to watch it.

140
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,680
Even if people say it's really, really bad.

141
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,700
Lord Grosses, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

142
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,360
Thank you, thank you.

143
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,280
Because you know, some people can be like...

144
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,940
I feel sometimes...

145
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,680
In a crowd, if a majority is overly critical...

146
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Then other people kind of adopt that belief.

147
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,680
Or they go in very like...

148
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,580
Like already...

149
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,080
They're already in it for a bad time.

150
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,240
Bandwagoning.

151
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Yeah, yeah, I think that's a good way to put it.

152
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
The herd mindset.

153
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,400
So...

154
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,220
Pessimistic?

155
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,140
Maybe.

156
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,470
Though, I understand why people often are pessimistic about...

157
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,700
About stuff.

158
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,580
Oh my gosh!

159
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,240
Speaking of pessimism...

160
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,820
Thank you, thanks for the gifted.

161
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,860
I...

162
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,660
I almost tweeted.

163
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,660
I almost tweeted yesterday.

164
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
I was about to say...

165
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,660
Because I can't watch the Switch 2 Direct...

166
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,040
Hollow Knight, what's it called?

167
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,480
What's the new one?

168
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,120
Silksong.

169
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, Silksong will be announced.

170
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,580
You're welcome.

171
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,060
In the same way that I did for Tomodachi Life.

172
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
But I was just like...

173
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,860
Nah, I'm not gonna say that.

174
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,460
I should have done it!

175
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,060
I should have done it!

176
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,760
But I was thinking...

177
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,240
I was like...

178
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,700
Nah, just whatever.

179
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,760
That would have been crazy.

180
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,320
I totally thought it though.

181
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,320
You have to believe me.

182
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,800
Nothing new shown.

183
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,880
But they showed a new date.

184
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,800
That's new.

185
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,900
They showed the year.

186
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,780
But yeah, I did watch the...

187
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,140
The...

188
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,220
The Direct.

189
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,840
Earlier.

190
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,240
So that was fun.

191
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,240
Today is my birthday!

192
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,640
Could I get a very special happy birthday from the cutest guy's maid?

193
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,020
Your boy, Gaster.

194
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,300
Happy birthday!

195
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,080
Happy birthday to you.

196
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,360
Happy birthday to you.

197
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,020
Happy birthday, your boy, Gaster.

198
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,200
Happy birthday to you.

199
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
Happy birthday!

200
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
Can you also miss all future Directs for prosperity?

201
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,320
Right?

202
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,120
But it feels like between last week and this week, many, many people are quite pleased.

203
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,240
So that's always a good thing, huh?

204
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,200
I got my number one The Jorker Dead Society badge.

205
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,600
I also have that.

206
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,340
Whoa, that was weird.

207
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,240
What was weird?

208
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,880
What happened?

209
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,460
Sorry, that's not what was weird.

210
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,020
That is my controller disconnecting because I'm yapping.

211
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,300
$4.50 for Switch 2 though.

212
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,340
Yeah, the pricing...

213
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,340
is very pain.

214
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,320
Save predictions for Twin Snakes on Switch 2?

215
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,720
Oh my gosh, wait.

216
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,020
Actually though, because we're getting GameCube games.

217
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,580
I didn't think about that.

218
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,820
It could actually happen.

219
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,400
It could actually happen.

220
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,160
Oh my gosh.

221
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,340
What controller am I using?

222
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,740
It's the Bitdo, 8Bitdo controller.

223
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,720
Yeah, yeah, I always use this one.

224
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,160
But also, it's my friend Marcelo's birthday.

225
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,240
The other day, can you please sing him the MGS5 happy birthday?

226
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,480
Of course, Winter Cedar.

227
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,220
Happy birthday, congratulations.

228
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,520
Happy birthday, with salutations.

229
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,460
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

230
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,640
Happy birthday to you, Marcelo!

231
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,920
Happy birthday!

232
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,290
Cool, cool, cool.

233
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,150
They have good controllers.

234
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:35,990
I have a couple of theirs.

235
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,430
Yeah, I really like this one.

236
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,450
If you're ever wanting a new controller that works for your computer.

237
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,710
You plan to play DMC4 reboot?

238
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,550
What is... DMC Devil May Cry?

239
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,240
Hashtag ad?

240
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,720
No.

241
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,480
This is my own personal recommendation.

242
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,740
Dropping offerings so one day my childhood video games get a revamp, remake someday.

243
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,540
Thank you for the offerings.

244
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,880
Product not guaranteed.

245
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,360
8BitDo controllers are the best, never going back.

246
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,880
Yeah, I really do like their controllers.

247
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,160
And it's pink.

248
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,580
So it's cute.

249
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,690
OK-ish time.

250
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,650
Waste turbo overall, it fell short.

251
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,130
DMC is a good game, but a bad Devil May Cry.

252
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,150
So it's...

253
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,050
Survival.

254
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,930
It's Metal Gear Survive.

255
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,790
I said survival, sorry.

256
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,730
Metal Gear Survive.

257
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,830
What type?

258
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,570
Mine is a wireless one.

259
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,770
Can my goat Kasane Teto get a late happy birthday?

260
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,790
Was it her birthday really?

261
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,890
That's one way to put it.

262
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,970
Did you get my direct related ping on the blue sky?

263
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,690
Sorry Nicholas, I am bad at checking blue sky.

264
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,070
I'm really bad.

265
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,110
So, I'm sorry though.

266
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,150
But yeah, I've yapped enough, I've yapped enough.

267
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,110
Shall we start?

268
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,210
So we are back to...

269
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,650
We are back to Dante.

270
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,950
Dante, Dante, Dante.

271
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,110
I'm going to Japan for the first time.

272
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,070
Do you want me to pick you up anything?

273
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,950
Jelly, jelly, jelly, please.

274
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,550
Side topic 2.

275
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,450
When I was playing a game hunting demons last night, I suddenly heard a ghastly...

276
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,630
Wait, what?

277
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,490
Real?

278
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,250
Oh, turned out the debut stream had randomly started playing during your mic test in the background window.

279
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,470
You're confirmed to be scary.

280
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,830
I am.

281
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,710
I told you all.

282
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,690
Some people like the DMC Reboot's music.

283
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,430
Can you blame them with lyrics like...

284
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,310
Ready, set, zombie, fist fight.

285
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,170
I don't know.

286
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,310
I don't think anything can top this song.

287
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,610
But I could be wrong.

288
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,970
You know?

289
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,630
Is it time?

290
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,050
Is it time for...

291
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,790
For fancy...

292
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,510
William Dante fancy pants?

293
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,770
Are you excited for the Nintendo Switch 2?

294
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,190
I think so.

295
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,130
It's hard to say.

296
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,450
There's not much that has been announced that's only for the Switch 2 that I'm like, gotta have it.

297
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,810
You know?

298
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,850
I'm not a super Mario Kart head.

299
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,550
I miss Ducky.

300
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,690
He'll come back, maybe.

301
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,510
He's going indie, I think I heard.

302
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,470
Celebrating my two months and my birthday.

303
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,790
Just for me!

304
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,470
I will sing a happy birthday and then we'll start.

305
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,390
Happy birthday to you.

306
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,130
Happy birthday to you.

307
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,010
Happy birthday just for me.

308
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,350
Happy birthday to you.

309
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,110
Happy birthday!

310
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,330
OK.

311
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,670
I think I'll try it.

312
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,790
Where are we at?

313
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,250
Mission.

314
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,650
Drive down the dragon that spreads its wickedness through the forest.

315
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,310
OK, that sounds...

316
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,590
I don't think we watched the cutscene for this mission yet.

317
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,120
So...

318
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,580
Is that red my DT?

319
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh good, all these carried over.

320
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,840
It did say that it would, didn't it?

321
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,340
Oh, we can get more porb!

322
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,040
There is no cutscene.

323
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,740
There wasn't?

324
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,620
Porb.

325
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,060
Dante's DT is red.

326
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,120
I think...

327
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,890
Oh, I've used that before.

328
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,110
I need to get...Oh, is charge shot good with Dante?

329
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,990
I didn't really use it so much, did I, before?

330
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,010
I tried and I sucked at it.

331
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,390
Not as good as Nero?

332
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,170
Always stinger.

333
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,350
So true!

334
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,510
So, so true.

335
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,970
We got that.

336
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,950
Oh, I don't have enough.

337
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,670
Big Mac!

338
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,350
Thanks for the gift!

339
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,450
Get more orbs!

340
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,410
Look at all those surrounding him.

341
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,350
Gosh.

342
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,930
Let me stop.

343
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,210
OK.

344
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,190
I'm sorry, I'm just going through everything again.

345
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,870
Right now I think we are OK.

346
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,430
ABS, always be stinger.

347
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,570
I love this music.

348
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,590
OK.

349
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,720
Power of the forest master is preventing you from escaping.

350
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,080
What's this sound?

351
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,950
OK.

352
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:03,510
Oh!

353
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,490
Oh no, we are back here.

354
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,150
Big fan of...you are...well, it is my birthday today!

355
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,090
Yes, me, Pedro Pascal.

356
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,230
From the hit series, The Mandalorian and The Last of Us.

357
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,470
Can you wish me a quick happy birthday?

358
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,310
Stay awesome, you lovely lady.

359
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,870
I don't think this is identity theft, right?

360
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,890
I have motivation.

361
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,570
Wait, that's so good.

362
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,630
Dante's ET is red, Nero's is blue.

363
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,470
I have motivation.

364
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,750
How about you?

365
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,510
Happy birthday, Pedro Pascal.

366
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,130
Happy birthday, Pedro Pascal.

367
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,710
Happy birthday, Pedro Pascal.

368
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,070
Happy birthday to you.

369
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,000
Gosh, rough weather we have here.

370
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,900
Inside.

371
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,600
It's nasty out.

372
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,900
OK, so now we actually have to go this way.

373
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,140
Do I go down?

374
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh, more.

375
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,500
DMC4 today, Framinto and the DMC anime tomorrow.

376
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,200
DMC fans are eating well this week.

377
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,100
It wasn't even planned either.

378
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,480
The purple fogs are teleporters?

379
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,200
Oh, they are?

380
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,520
Oh, I thought it was just a wall.

381
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,480
Is this a maze?

382
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,300
Oh my gosh, I forgot that we look like that for a second.

383
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,500
I can't.

384
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,220
Who's the gal that 100% all...

385
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,540
All robs.

386
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,060
That's the girl, Minfanta.

387
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,290
Wasn't this the exit?

388
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,130
Oh, well...

389
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,610
Oh no, we are back here.

390
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,390
I could go down.

391
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:41,850
Hold on.

392
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,770
What does this one take me to then?

393
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,410
Does this rain destroy the bitrate?

394
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,790
I'm curious.

395
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,840
Oh, we are back here.

396
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,440
OK.

397
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,940
A little?

398
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,320
Sorry about that.

399
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,040
Sorry about that.

400
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,540
OK, I definitely think we have to go down then.

401
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,880
Wait, or I went... Wait.

402
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,140
I think I went this way and then it teleported me.

403
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,120
Oh my gosh, I just noticed that it's all collapsed.

404
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,560
Because it happened last time, yeah.

405
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,880
OK, let's go.

406
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,880
Wait.

407
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,960
Don't come at me like that.

408
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,400
Gross, nasty.

409
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,730
I hear someone laughing.

410
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,330
Who's laughing at me?

411
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,650
Oh, there's more.

412
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,150
There's more.

413
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,870
I'm going to teleport.

414
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,610
Wait, can I go through?

415
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,270
Point and laugh.

416
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,270
Point and laugh at the VTuber.

417
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,150
Oh, I can't tell where I'm at at all.

418
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,010
No 100% roar for me.

419
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,330
Just kidding.

420
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,010
Oh wait, I think I kind of remember this area.

421
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,790
Yes, I remember this area.

422
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,390
She's laughing at me.

423
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,870
All sexy like.

424
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,150
Oh, what the hell?

425
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,450
Damn.

426
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,320
Oh,

427
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,940
you're still alive?

428
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,820
I

429
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,070
just gave him one shot.

430
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,670
Point blank to the face, baby.

431
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,910
Where is this lady at?

432
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,800
Stop, she's so sexy.

433
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,860
Oh, can I not activate this since I don't have the spooky hand?

434
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,500
Oh, I can.

435
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,320
Interesting.

436
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,340
Find the sexy lady.

437
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,520
I thought we killed her.

438
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,640
She's such a sore loser.

439
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,240
No, I was so close.

440
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,900
Ok, I give up.

441
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,200
When I get here, she sounds closer, but...

442
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,680
Oh, is it because... Am I supposed to go over there, lady?

443
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,130
I love finding these little eggs.

444
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:38,990
It's like Easter.

445
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,450
Oh, she did run away.

446
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,120
Ok, I'll go in.

447
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,390
Lady?

448
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:51,710
Oh.

449
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,990
Seems like we are in the right direction.

450
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,930
Otherwise it wouldn't stop us.

451
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,430
Where are you?

452
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,150
Oh, I see you.

453
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,140
Don't get up.

454
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,050
Get your balls now.

455
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,960
Return to IA.

456
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,420
Return to IA.

457
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,300
Blast off.

458
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,120
IA.

459
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,160
Blast off.

460
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,180
IA.

461
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,160
Blast off.

462
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,360
Oh, my robes over here.

463
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,620
I didn't get them in time.

464
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,100
The more robes, the more plorbs, everybody.

465
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,180
It's very important.

466
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,920
IA.

467
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,720
IA.

468
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,200
Are you guys having a good Wednesday?

469
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,680
It's hump day.

470
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,860
Hi,

471
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,460
Mito.

472
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:30,860
Hello.

473
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,910
Oh, why did it change like that?

474
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,770
What do you mean you are now?

475
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,570
That's pretty nice.

476
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,950
That's good.

477
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,060
No, because I'm working.

478
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,500
Boo.

479
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,320
Oh, I hear her again.

480
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,540
We are close.

481
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,240
Is this still here?

482
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,980
Oh, my gosh.

483
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,500
It is.

484
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,020
What is it?

485
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,400
Oh, wait.

486
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,060
We did this one.

487
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,420
That's right.

488
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,760
I completed it.

489
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,880
I was like, why isn't it red?

490
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,520
Because I'm so good.

491
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,720
Oh, wait.

492
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,620
No.

493
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,160
Oh, gosh.

494
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,620
Please.

495
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,340
Wait, how am I supposed to beat you guys without the grabby grab?

496
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,720
Oh, my God.

497
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,420
Wait, I'd rather... I don't want to.

498
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,520
I don't want to.

499
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,860
Yes.

500
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,100
Ouchie.

501
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,410
Gun.

502
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,940
Nice.

503
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,530
Easy peasy.

504
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,770
Tricks.

505
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,770
Nice.

506
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,520
Lady.

507
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,640
Lady, my lady.

508
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,760
Not that lady, but other...

509
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,360
Other lady.

510
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,700
I hear you laughing.

511
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,740
Which way do I go?

512
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,800
Do I go inside or do I go to the purple?

513
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,920
Hey, what?

514
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,380
Then there's also this purple.

515
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,360
Where does that lead to?

516
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,760
Use your lady detection senses.

517
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,260
You can hear how stuffy my nose is.

518
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,420
Because of my allergies.

519
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,970
How is that cute?

520
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,830
Wait, look at this.

521
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,590
Look at this nerd.

522
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,410
He's probably... Oh, my gosh.

523
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,270
This is the worst outfit to wear in the rain.

524
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,410
He's like soaked and it's probably dripping and just heavy.

525
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,890
Why did I... Why?

526
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,310
Why?

527
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,970
Why?

528
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,530
Why?

529
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,390
Why?

530
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:04,970
Why?

531
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,570
Why?

532
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:05,890
Why?

533
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,910
Why?

534
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,230
Why?

535
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:08,750
Why?

536
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,370
Why?

537
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:10,810
Why?

538
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,750
Why?

539
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,030
Why?

540
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:12,590
Why?

541
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,030
Why?

542
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:13,970
Why?

543
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,270
Why?

544
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:15,830
Why?

545
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,610
Why?

546
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,520
Give me my money.

547
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,180
It's stuck down there.

548
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,040
No, my money!

549
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,100
Why?

550
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,540
Why?

551
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,240
Ouch.

552
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,400
You know what?

553
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,000
Dang it, I hate this area.

554
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,860
I hate this area.

555
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,160
Yeah.

556
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,650
Oh no!

557
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,150
Please come back!

558
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,250
We missed her.

559
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,630
I have a feeling I go into the one underneath.

560
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:31,950
Maybe.

561
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,570
Again?

562
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,510
Seriously?

563
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,230
Maybe not.

564
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:37,990
Where am I?

565
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,250
Wait, I'm lost.

566
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,270
Oh, here we are.

567
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,410
Where are you?

568
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,100
No, no, no!

569
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,520
Turn around!

570
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,410
Nice!

571
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,740
Get him!

572
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,360
No!

573
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,370
Tricks!

574
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:46,870
Who are you?

575
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,210
Which do you guys think?

576
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,010
This way or down here?

577
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,590
Which do you guys think?

578
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,810
Oh, Ebony Ivory!

579
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,130
Wait, how do I...

580
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,330
There we go.

581
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,150
Ebony Ivory.

582
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,670
There we go.

583
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,850
This way.

584
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,110
Whatever I think.

585
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,830
I think... I'm gonna try this way then.

586
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,970
She's laughing.

587
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,070
Oh, dang it.

588
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,610
She's laughing here.

589
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,550
Oh, she's laughing.

590
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,430
She's laughing.

591
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,350
She thinks it's really funny.

592
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,990
I told the best joke ever.

593
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,490
She's into me.

594
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,250
Maybe not.

595
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,730
She's laughing at the idea.

596
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,690
Dang it.

597
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,730
Am I supposed to get back to her or...

598
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,730
Wait, I can do this now because I'm...

599
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,990
Oh my God!

600
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,550
I can do this one now.

601
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,640
I don't feel like it though.

602
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,080
Sorry.

603
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,840
Guys...

604
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,240
Is anyone else feeling lazy today?

605
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,920
Try with Sword Master.

606
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,280
Sword Master.

607
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,650
It's remembering all the combos.

608
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,810
We're so close though.

609
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,860
Blade!

610
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,140
Circle in the air.

611
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,580
Square, circle.

612
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,780
This one?

613
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,280
She's so loud.

614
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,860
Loud lady.

615
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,640
Oh, but we can't do this one.

616
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,260
Oh wait, this...Oh wait.

617
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,600
This is just the other one.

618
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,420
What did this one go to again?

619
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,540
I remember we opened up the path down there though.

620
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,960
Maybe I go that way instead.

621
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,840
I think... Do I not go down?

622
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,440
Do I not go through here instead?

623
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,180
I feel like I go through here.

624
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,460
Let me see.

625
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,700
Oh, it's not raining here.

626
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,080
Oh, hello.

627
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,310
What?

628
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,860
Oh my goodness.

629
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,120
You, chill out.

630
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,260
Oh, you're both dead.

631
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,100
Quit your whining.

632
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,990
The music is kind of funny here.

633
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,370
Do I have to do this again?

634
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:01,210
Oh wait, because didn't I do this to get to the area where the lady is at?

635
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,230
Those who treat her unkindly will fall into darkness.

636
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,830
Okay, so I go... Wait, hold on.

637
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,570
Let me read it.

638
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,570
Those who do not wish for darkness should seek the light.

639
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,090
Okay, so I just follow...

640
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,650
the shadow...

641
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,930
and also collect robes.

642
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,060
Okay, so we go this way.

643
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,730
If you go the wrong way once, you can get a Bloor fragment.

644
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,110
Is that...

645
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,870
Is that real?

646
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,770
How many Bloor fragments do I have right now?

647
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,750
2 out of 4.

648
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:16,950
It is true?

649
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,710
Chat, is this real?

650
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,150
It's real.

651
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,030
Try it.

652
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:24,850
Really?

653
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,190
Well, we've only gone one way.

654
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,550
Let's try it.

655
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,370
I was supposed to fill your dark zone with light.

656
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,360
Oh my goodness, stop.

657
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm trying to stinger you.

658
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,680
Please.

659
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,320
I'm trying to get close to you.

660
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,040
Why

661
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,420
do...

662
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,740
Everytime...

663
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,720
You are near...

664
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,600
Just like me...

665
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,480
I long to be...

666
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,480
Close to you...

667
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,540
That's it?

668
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,180
Bloor!

669
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,200
Bloor fragment at the top far right wall.

670
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,310
Here?

671
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,530
There really is one!

672
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,950
I don't think I can...

673
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,610
Can I not get it though?

674
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,010
Because I don't have a grabby grab.

675
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,710
Oh no!

676
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,610
DT can triple jump.

677
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,270
Thank you!

678
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,390
Nice!

679
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,080
Oh my gosh, again?

680
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm running!

681
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,450
Run away!

682
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,150
So it is the same.

683
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,070
What's this purple one?

684
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:42,190
If you want to leave this forest, do not fall into darkness, but rather treat her kindly to proceed.

685
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,490
Where there is light, there must be shadow, but shadow leads only to darkness.

686
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,300
And then this probably says the same thing though.

687
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,920
So we go back from where we came.

688
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:55,860
Bamboo!

689
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,820
Welcome to bamboo ship!

690
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,180
Okay.

691
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,380
Is there a third one now?

692
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:06,940
This.

693
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,180
Am I going the right way?

694
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:08,520
Hold on.

695
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,260
Thanks for telling me about the blower fragment you guys.

696
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,840
I really appreciate it.

697
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,260
It's this way right?

698
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:32,720
If you get it wrong they add more hints.

699
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,560
Oh that's so cute!

700
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,140
That's so nice actually.

701
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,000
She's laughing.

702
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:40,900
She's laughing.

703
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,110
Fifty...Wait!

704
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,030
30,000!

705
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:50,750
I can get one!

706
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,000
I wish I could buy another blower.

707
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,040
Oh I can only get one more blower.

708
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,460
Am I kind of in the way?

709
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,540
Let me shrink down just a tiny bit.

710
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,360
Okay.

711
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,060
Very good DT time.

712
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,440
I'm here for...Oh my gosh I'm all dressed up for the date you guys.

713
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,760
This is the perfect outfit to pick actually.

714
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,240
Are we going to use brother's sword to close the game?

715
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,510
She's...He just shakes his head.

716
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,190
She's spitting her seed.

717
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,130
I don't want...Yeah, kick him back into the woods.

718
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,090
This is an invasive species.

719
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:09,980
Good!

720
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,100
Dark souls are the best.

721
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:21,880
But the kindest fate I offer is to unify and spend eternity with a child of mine.

722
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,760
Sweet child of mine.

723
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,120
And slurp him up like a little spaghetti.

724
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,020
He looks so stupid.

725
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:44,620
Interesting.

726
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,050
Sexy lady, where'd you go?

727
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,300
I don't know how I dodged that, but I am so good.

728
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,900
Damn.

729
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,820
Oh no, she's going to spit.

730
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,140
Oh come on, I thought I got it.

731
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,080
Can I get her?

732
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,280
Get her sack.

733
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,560
Gross.

734
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,240
She's so gross.

735
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,020
Let me get that thing real quick.

736
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,060
Alright.

737
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,960
Hit the sack.

738
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,220
I did not avoid it this time.

739
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,260
Oh no, please, please let me...

740
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,180
Please, let me get a hit, please.

741
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,220
Oh my god, please.

742
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,580
Please, oh my god.

743
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

744
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,500
Oh, that did like nothing.

745
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,920
I wish I could... Wait, is it because I'm sword master?

746
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,140
How do I... Wait, oh here we go.

747
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,340
Okay, hold on, I'm remembering.

748
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,940
Sorry guys.

749
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,200
There we go.

750
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,180
Circle mid-area.

751
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:43,980
There we go.

752
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,050
Oh my god.

753
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:05,130
Okay, she's just spamming the same attack over and

754
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:09,380
over.

755
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,220
What are you doing?

756
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:14,600
No.

757
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:20,860
Oh

758
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,110
my god, she just took that guy out.

759
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:43,570
Woop.

760
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,960
Save it.

761
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,100
No, please.

762
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,640
My health.

763
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,080
She's strong.

764
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,240
Oh my gosh, she's strong.

765
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,060
I'm healing, I'm healing.

766
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,580
Oh my gosh, how do I avoid?

767
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,160
I'm so dead.

768
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,300
No, I'll just do it again.

769
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,280
I'll just redo it.

770
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,540
But I wasted a lot of health, I feel.

771
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,580
Not remembering the mid-air attack.

772
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,110
Abandon all hope.

773
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,100
Trickster dash for dodge.

774
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,700
That could work.

775
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,600
Did it save my stuff?

776
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,100
No, we lost all of my DT.

777
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,520
I'm gonna have to re-get it back.

778
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,280
Try to upgrade swordmaster and trickster.

779
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,880
I'm pretty sure I have both of them at max.

780
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,880
Or at least, I can't afford the max I think of swordmaster.

781
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,600
Also gonna try... Is gunslinger any good in this fight too?

782
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,460
Maybe if I use that one.

783
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,960
Wait, what was it?

784
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,380
Hold on.

785
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,180
Hold on, I gotta look up.

786
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,180
Wait, hold on.

787
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,840
Systems maybe?

788
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,940
Not options.

789
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,000
I don't remember how to do the dodge.

790
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,960
It's under skills?

791
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,660
Abilities?

792
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,400
Side roll?

793
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:10,620
RB?

794
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,220
Oh, I was doing RT.

795
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,180
And A.

796
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,760
Okay.

797
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:18,860
RBA.

798
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,260
So I lock on and A.

799
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:21,560
Okay.

800
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,720
Maybe that's what I was doing earlier.

801
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,020
Or trickster circle.

802
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,220
Yeah.

803
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,300
Or trickster circle.

804
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,080
But I still wanted to know how to do it just in case I wasn't switched.

805
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,220
RB.

806
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:43,420
Okay.

807
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:43,640
Okay.

808
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:09,790
Nasty!

809
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,930
She spit another thing or not?

810
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,010
Oh, come on!

811
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:18,690
Come on!

812
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:19,170
Come on!

813
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,490
I'm not even... Come on!

814
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:21,290
Dante!

815
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:22,890
There we go.

816
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:34,620
Woo!

817
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,780
Oh, that worked actually.

818
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,900
Oh, wait!

819
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,380
Oh, I did it though!

820
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,280
Yay!

821
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,880
Oh, I didn't press A!

822
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,300
I did like...

823
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,220
Did

824
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,200
I kill this thing?

825
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,820
Oh, no I didn't.

826
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:24,710
Yeah!

827
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:25,490
Take it down!

828
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:25,890
Take it down!

829
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,610
Oh, if only I had DT'd!

830
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,500
Ouch!

831
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Ouch!

832
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Ouch!

833
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:05,790
Okay.

834
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:07,910
Nice!

835
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:08,250
Nice!

836
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,690
Nice!

837
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,420
Come

838
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,460
on!

839
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:43,280
Just a little bit!

840
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:43,640
There we go!

841
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,870
Did we get to absorb her power?

842
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,460
One down.

843
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,660
This does not fit the look at all.

844
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,740
Oh my gosh!

845
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,720
She looks so cool!

846
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,900
I was drinking my tea.

847
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,400
Yeah!

848
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,320
He's kicking!

849
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:45,900
He's punching!

850
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:46,420
He's kicking!

851
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,080
He's punching!

852
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:56,490
Oh my gosh!

853
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,130
He's stacking!

854
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:01,350
Jenga!

855
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,040
Two to go.

856
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,440
Okay.

857
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,840
Nice!

858
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,340
Gilgamesh!

859
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:20,560
A devilish weapon that absorbs organic material and transforms it to steel.

860
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,360
This weapon is capable of creating powerful impacts.

861
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:25,780
Damn!

862
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,400
Why?

863
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:26,720
Why?

864
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,040
Why?

865
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,460
Why?

866
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,220
Any part of this combo can be charged by holding down.

867
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:30,740
Why?

868
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,200
Girugamish!

869
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,180
Alright, he had to change swords.

870
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:35,480
Yup!

871
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:35,580
Yup!

872
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:35,780
Yup!

873
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,900
And now we can escape.

874
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,020
Yippee!

875
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,800
Oh!

876
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,140
Oh!

877
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:45,440
Oh!

878
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,100
Hold on!

879
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,100
Let me get my money.

880
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,300
My rewards.

881
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,100
Wowee!

882
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,970
My rewards, exactly!

883
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,990
My rewards!

884
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,690
And I didn't even need to heal in that fight.

885
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,650
Let's go baby!

886
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,930
Though I spent all of it on the plorbs.

887
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,970
So I would like to get a little bit more back.

888
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:22,370
Thank you!

889
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:22,770
Thank you!

890
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,010
Okey dokey!

891
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:27,110
I guess we just go from...

892
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:28,470
Well, we can't go this way.

893
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:29,310
Well, not us.

894
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,070
Wow!

895
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:36,450
Man!

896
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:36,910
Gravity!

897
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,290
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

898
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,730
Gaming go!

899
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,730
Movies!

900
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:42,390
Welcome to the membership!

901
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:43,270
Thank you!

902
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,930
She is literally gaming.

903
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:47,490
I'm gaming.

904
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,930
I'm literally playing a game.

905
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:53,210
Yay!

906
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,050
Nice job on that boss.

907
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,590
I'm impressed with the evolution of your gaming skill.

908
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:58,990
Really?

909
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:02,210
Thanks!

910
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:02,390
Easy!

911
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:05,670
C.

912
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,590
C for C!

913
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,390
I told you I can do it!

914
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:11,790
C!

915
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:19,950
Mission.

916
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:25,530
Get through as quickly as possible.

917
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,050
Okey, I'm going to have to remember how to get home.

918
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:36,250
Okey, as quickly as possible.

919
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:40,030
My therapist said that Monocle Dante wasn't real.

920
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,550
My Oshi can dodge!

921
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:43,310
I'm so proud!

922
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,890
Sign me up for Dark Souls, baby!

923
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,510
I'll play that new not-Bloodborne game.

924
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,990
Okey, so far there is not a timer.

925
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,830
What in the world is that?

926
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,070
That thing is ugly as hell!

927
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:06,050
It reminds me of those...

928
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,070
Do you guys know...

929
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,390
I won't be greedy.

930
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,530
Do you guys know the...

931
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:22,190
In Legend of Zelda, like Link's Awakening, there is the little guys that come from the sand.

932
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:33,350
I'm not very fast, so...

933
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,630
Oh my Stinger!

934
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:39,730
I miss you, Stinger!

935
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,170
The Octor... I don't think it's the Octoroks.

936
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:47,510
They don't shoot.

937
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,710
These things are nasty.

938
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,890
They come from the ground and they look just like these guys.

939
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:00,710
How do I get out of here?

940
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:01,790
Oh my gosh.

941
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:01,870
Oh my gosh.

942
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:05,530
Oh my goodness.

943
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,380
Did I kill him?

944
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:25,350
Or...

945
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,500
I don't know.

946
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,740
I think I missed my opportunity with the other guy.

947
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,520
That's kind of stinky.

948
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,500
No!

949
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,100
Oh my gosh.

950
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,560
I'm going to switch back for this.

951
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,460
I need to be faster.

952
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,660
I need to be faster here.

953
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,700
There we go.

954
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,890
These guys are so stinky.

955
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,180
There we go.

956
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,740
Holy moly.

957
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,560
Wait, there is more?

958
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:15,900
Where?

959
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,360
Oh my gosh.

960
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,140
There is more.

961
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,260
No!

962
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,100
Please leave me alone.

963
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,700
Oh no, it's you.

964
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,100
Ouch,

965
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:36,340
ouch, ouch.

966
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,520
Oh my gosh.

967
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:40,880
Please.

968
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,540
I hate you.

969
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,620
I hate you already.

970
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,980
No, dodge, dodge, dodge, please.

971
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,080
Dodge, dodge, dodge.

972
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,760
I'm just gonna...

973
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,080
Get out of my face, please.

974
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,680
So bad, those dark souls.

975
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,680
Maybe I spoke too soon.

976
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,880
Maybe I got a little overly confident.

977
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,880
Maybe I got a little...

978
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,260
I'm grabbing some health while we can.

979
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,900
I don't remember how to get out of here.

980
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,720
No, I've run through these forest so much.

981
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,620
I don't know which way.

982
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,580
Give me more green.

983
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:55,800
Thank you.

984
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,120
Ok, that should be good.

985
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,900
Minto eating her words?

986
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,880
Check the map.

987
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,220
I don't think that's the map actually.

988
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,500
We are trying to get to there, right?

989
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,960
Oh, so I am...

990
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:15,190
Wait.

991
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,990
Yeah, we are trying to get to there.

992
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,290
That's it, right?

993
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,190
No, that's...

994
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,730
To the castle?

995
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:23,110
Wait.

996
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:25,910
Which is the exit?

997
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:31,730
I didn't know you could kill that thing.

998
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,010
I've played this game 10 times.

999
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,490
What?

1000
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:36,990
Wait.

1001
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,050
You are leaving the forest?

1002
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:41,830
Yeah, but I can't tell which way is the forest.

1003
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:42,970
Wait, forest entrance.

1004
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,350
Ok, ok.

1005
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,190
So, yes, I am going...

1006
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:47,510
Wait, but can I get through here?

1007
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,110
Can I get through that area?

1008
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:55,910
Oh, shoot.

1009
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,110
Wait, I must...

1010
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:00,870
Be able to.

1011
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,150
Did you see Wonderfest?

1012
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:10,370
They are making figures of Naked Snake from Snake Eater and Raiden from MGS4.

1013
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:11,410
I did see that!

1014
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,350
I saw the news.

1015
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,730
I can't believe tomorrow is your last day.

1016
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:16,670
I'll miss you, boss.

1017
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:17,730
What news?

1018
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:19,570
No!

1019
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,970
You read wrong!

1020
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,990
Ok.

1021
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,810
Wait, hold on.

1022
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:31,490
I'm checking the map.

1023
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:31,730
Ok.

1024
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:34,730
I think we are going the correct direction.

1025
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,150
I think we are going...

1026
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:39,870
The right way.

1027
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,070
Who's in here?

1028
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,870
You guys.

1029
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:47,210
Ouch!

1030
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,390
Oh my gosh, they spit?

1031
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:49,710
Since when?

1032
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,110
Since when do you spit?

1033
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:56,590
Where are you?

1034
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:57,970
Oh, shoot.

1035
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,250
Are

1036
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,600
you dead?

1037
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,920
Making sure I get my glory.

1038
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,680
My fame and glory.

1039
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,750
My fame and glory.

1040
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:55,630
Don't believe him.

1041
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:56,470
He's a spy.

1042
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:57,750
Wait, who am I believing?

1043
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,430
Who am I to believe?

1044
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,810
What am I not trusting?

1045
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:04,770
What's going on?

1046
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:05,750
What are you guys talking about?

1047
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:10,350
Ok.

1048
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:12,990
Stop!

1049
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,030
These guys are so obsessed with me.

1050
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:19,990
They're like Dante.

1051
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:24,510
It's got them really sick out, but...

1052
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,510
I'm going the right way, right?

1053
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,010
Yep.

1054
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,220
And then we go...

1055
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,000
We go upwards.

1056
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,660
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1057
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,180
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1058
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,040
Sunny day, oh sunny day.

1059
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,800
What are we going to fight in here, I wonder?

1060
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,930
Puppets!

1061
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,820
Oh my goodness, ouch!

1062
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:23,560
Stop

1063
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:29,990
doing...

1064
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:32,790
Go away!

1065
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,870
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

1066
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:35,130
You know what?

1067
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:35,550
Screw it.

1068
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,200
I don't want to deal with your stinky anymore.

1069
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:44,900
Two guys.

1070
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:45,620
Two guys.

1071
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,420
At least these guys give me health.

1072
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,280
That's kind of nice.

1073
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:00,940
Ok.

1074
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,520
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1075
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,080
Gravity, thank you for the 20 gets a dick!

1076
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,640
No grabby arm on Dante, I know it's so sad.

1077
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,480
It's like so sad actually.

1078
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,160
Do these guys like never unspawn?

1079
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,580
It's kind of nice if they do.

1080
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,600
Ok, we go...

1081
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,920
That seems to be the case.

1082
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,080
Breakdown!

1083
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:44,240
They don't stop coming, they don't stop coming, they don't stop coming.

1084
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,420
But they can't come on the cliff.

1085
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,820
Okie dokie.

1086
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,120
Hello?

1087
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,420
Hello?

1088
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,700
Rorb statue.

1089
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,700
Hello?

1090
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:11,580
Nice.

1091
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,360
A little treasure trove in here.

1092
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,420
Nice.

1093
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,160
Take that and that and that and that.

1094
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,260
Did we do this one?

1095
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,100
Sacred mission.

1096
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:32,360
Royal blocker.

1097
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,760
Successfully execute a royal block 5 times.

1098
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,640
I think I'm good.

1099
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,020
A royal block?

1100
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:48,100
You mean I actually have to use royal guard?

1101
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,840
You mean I actually have to play the game to it's full potential?

1102
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,960
What is that?

1103
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,420
Bright?

1104
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,960
I saw something glowing over here.

1105
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,600
Vital star.

1106
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,020
It's gonna be a whole stream?

1107
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:09,940
Surely.

1108
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,760
What a nice day.

1109
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,420
Why is it starting to get rainy again?

1110
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,400
I'm just making sure...

1111
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:21,540
Okay.

1112
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,760
Okay, I'm leaving.

1113
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:27,980
I'm getting out of here.

1114
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:31,980
What's that?

1115
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,120
Why are there...

1116
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:39,680
Oh, I thought that was a carpet.

1117
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:43,640
Quickly Dante.

1118
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,800
Oh yeah, that was the mission wasn't it?

1119
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,400
Get out of here as quick as possible.

1120
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:50,480
Oops.

1121
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,020
They didn't give me a timer so...

1122
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,000
Quick is subjective, no?

1123
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:29,870
That's a nice score by Dusei.

1124
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,130
So myself, SPA.

1125
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:35,010
More like SUPA.

1126
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:41,950
If I could, I think I'd get the letter P. That's my stylish point.

1127
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:45,790
Nice.

1128
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,490
Costume change?

1129
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,410
We can change.

1130
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,490
Fortuna Castle.

1131
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:55,390
Exterminate the defenders of the icy plain.

1132
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,470
Alright, let me go to...

1133
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:00,550
Mission menu.

1134
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,030
And we shall change outfits.

1135
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:03,670
Don't worry.

1136
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:12,330
Don't worry about that guy.

1137
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,710
The P stands for points, obviously.

1138
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:23,550
Virgil jumpscare?

1139
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:26,690
Who?

1140
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,190
That's my brother!

1141
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,430
That's my brother!

1142
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:31,890
That's my brother!

1143
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,270
That's my brother!

1144
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:37,270
That's my brother.

1145
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,110
Sorry, wrong room.

1146
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:42,110
What did you say about my brother?

1147
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,690
That's not a who, that's my brother.

1148
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:50,270
SBA stands for... that's right, super badass, a ghost.

1149
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:55,310
Wait, it stands for... SBA stands for super badass?

1150
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:55,810
Super badass?

1151
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,790
Exterminate the defenders of the icy plain.

1152
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,750
Why is it suddenly icy?

1153
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:06,710
You got blue Dante?

1154
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,570
Blue Dante.

1155
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:17,010
So do you think Dante is cherry flavored and Virgil is blue raspberry flavored?

1156
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,390
What flavor do you think Nero is?

1157
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:22,510
I imagine him to be a grape flavor.

1158
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,390
Like a mix between...

1159
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:27,270
blue and red.

1160
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:29,750
Dante is cherry.

1161
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,160
Nero is a lemon.

1162
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,080
Lemon lime?

1163
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,760
You think lemon instead of grape?

1164
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,060
I see Dante more as cola than cherry.

1165
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:49,680
I can't exp...

1166
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,540
No, no, no!

1167
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,280
Swiftfish?

1168
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,100
I get it, actually.

1169
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,080
I get what you mean.

1170
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,280
No, no, no.

1171
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,740
You are onto something.

1172
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,660
Dante being cola flavored makes sense, actually.

1173
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,740
No, I get it.

1174
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:06,580
Cherry cola!

1175
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:08,880
Yes!

1176
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,900
That's so good.

1177
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:12,880
Nero is Pepsi?

1178
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,400
Wouldn't Virgil be Pepsi?

1179
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:19,720
Anyway.

1180
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,560
Power up?

1181
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,980
I don't think I can get anything, can I?

1182
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,620
Well, I guess...

1183
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,180
Yes, we can!

1184
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,200
A dramatic display of power.

1185
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,440
Flush.

1186
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,060
Transform simple jumps into damage dealing attacks.

1187
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,820
Let's try it.

1188
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,580
Wait, so this is just...

1189
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,080
This is just a stinger.

1190
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,560
Oh my god!

1191
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,080
I wonder what flavor mint would be.

1192
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,080
Who knows?

1193
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,660
No one tell him.

1194
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,160
No one tell him, guys.

1195
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:20,810
Whoa!

1196
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,130
Oh, I made it!

1197
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,330
I made it to the top!

1198
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:33,950
I just realized we don't have Nero's little glowy arm anymore, so we don't know what secrets are around.

1199
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,730
Wow, this is crazy!

1200
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,370
Oh, I can do this one!

1201
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:50,070
Wait.

1202
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:53,610
There we go.

1203
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,010
There we go.

1204
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:56,230
Okay.

1205
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:58,450
Actually, I didn't check out what that was before.

1206
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:03,710
Okay.

1207
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,870
I don't actually feel like doing that.

1208
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:06,610
I'm sorry, guys.

1209
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,870
I don't know why I'm so lazy today.

1210
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,310
I think it's because I woke up so early.

1211
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:12,130
I'm just quite lazy today.

1212
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:12,690
I'm sorry.

1213
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:17,050
I also did a lot of cleaning, so I'm just like...

1214
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:17,110
Ah!

1215
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:31,590
Oh!

1216
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,830
That seems...

1217
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,180
Yeah!

1218
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,140
What is that reaction?

1219
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:52,230
Oh my god, his lightning speed.

1220
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,450
This guy is insane!

1221
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,650
Oh my god!

1222
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:10,160
Oh my gosh!

1223
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,880
What the hell am I supposed to do with you?

1224
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,840
Oh my god!

1225
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,350
Oh dang it!

1226
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:24,510
Okay.

1227
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,290
Oh, shoot.

1228
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:36,370
Oh!

1229
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:38,750
Oh my gosh!

1230
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,090
He's insane!

1231
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:44,190
I think maybe my sword might be better here.

1232
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:46,050
Oh my gosh, maybe not.

1233
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,340
He's not electricity anymore.

1234
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,760
Electricity out of him.

1235
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:15,120
Oh, nevermind.

1236
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:15,580
Uh-oh.

1237
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,140
I spoke too soon.

1238
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,200
Oh shoot!

1239
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:23,920
Oh my god.

1240
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,560
I'm trying to dodge him.

1241
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:32,670
Oh, okay.

1242
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,960
Does he even absorb this?

1243
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,900
Oh my god.

1244
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,140
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1245
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,600
I'm actually gonna die to this guy.

1246
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,780
I think I've just been taking damage this entire time.

1247
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,380
No, I'll just redo it.

1248
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,320
Oh man!

1249
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,280
Oh my god!

1250
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,780
Gunslinger, use your gun until you stun Gilgamesh.

1251
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,400
Yeah, I think I was like thinking I was damaging him, but I was just taking damage.

1252
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,460
Because you touch him and it's like so bad.

1253
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,740
There we go, Gunslinger.

1254
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,600
What the heck?

1255
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,400
He's really cool though.

1256
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,140
Oh my goodness!

1257
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:53,890
Oh my god!

1258
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,730
Even then I can't dodge.

1259
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:19,880
Oh my gosh!

1260
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,900
Maybe I switch... Oh no.

1261
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,440
Oops.

1262
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,220
Where is he?

1263
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,100
Let's just spam I guess.

1264
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,240
Where is he?

1265
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,120
Okay,

1266
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,280
and then...

1267
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,160
No, no way.

1268
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:23,860
No way.

1269
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,360
Oh my god.

1270
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,720
Oh no, please.

1271
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:29,960
Shoot.

1272
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,320
Oh my god.

1273
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:34,380
Oh my god, please!

1274
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:48,680
I'm abandoned all hope real.

1275
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,180
Oh my god.

1276
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,670
This is insane!

1277
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,690
This guy is just the real skill check.

1278
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:06,910
He just comes out of nowhere.

1279
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,570
I was just like, oh by the way, are you good at the game yet?

1280
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,990
And he also... It takes so long.

1281
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:14,950
Maybe... Okay, let me switch to Evony and Ivory.

1282
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:17,790
We're on Gunslinger.

1283
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:19,850
Oh my god.

1284
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,330
He's so crazy!

1285
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:25,790
He takes so much...

1286
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,210
Ouch.

1287
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:32,770
I thought I dodged that.

1288
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:34,150
Oh my god.

1289
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:34,970
Okay, fine.

1290
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:35,730
Thank you.

1291
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:36,030
Fine.

1292
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,580
Ouchie ouch.

1293
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:54,800
I wanna see if I can just get him like...

1294
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,280
Oh my god.

1295
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:55,760
Oh please.

1296
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,840
There we go.

1297
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,080
No,

1298
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:05,660
no.

1299
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:06,560
Okay, nevermind.

1300
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,740
I think I know what to do.

1301
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,200
Please, don't recharge.

1302
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:13,920
Please, don't recharge.

1303
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,220
Please, don't recharge.

1304
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:16,140
Please...

1305
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,860
No, no, no, no!

1306
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,600
No, no, no!

1307
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,880
No, please!

1308
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:24,440
Please!

1309
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:25,600
No!

1310
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:25,720
No!

1311
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:30,700
Oh, I killed him.

1312
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,940
He killed himself actually.

1313
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:45,070
Just screaming for my life.

1314
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,580
Blitz is my favorite demon in the entire Devil May Cry series.

1315
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,240
Especially when I'm fighting him as Nero because the buster for Blitz looks so cool.

1316
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:56,040
I have to fight him again!

1317
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,340
No!

1318
01:25:59,340 --> 01:25:59,520
No!

1319
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,820
Don't make me!

1320
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,620
I see you.

1321
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,820
I see you.

1322
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,900
The floor is completely shrouded by the ice wall.

1323
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,460
Reaching the door to return to town is an impossible dream.

1324
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,240
To destroy this magical barrier of ice, it must be stopped at its source.

1325
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,740
Oh well, where is that?

1326
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:25,820
Okay.

1327
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:35,020
This is the roar we've been wanting to get.

1328
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:47,890
Does it...

1329
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:51,370
Oh no!

1330
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,690
Oh no!

1331
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:58,710
How icy are we talking?

1332
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:07,530
This one is open.

1333
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,530
13...

1334
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,290
Kick 13 has an enhanced version and D2 likes Stinger.

1335
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:16,090
Oh, thank you.

1336
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:19,270
I'll try and...

1337
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:23,370
I feel so fast with my sword so that's why I use it more often.

1338
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:26,210
But...

1339
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,710
I'll try to...

1340
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,950
use it too.

1341
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:34,190
Oh.

1342
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:36,810
Wait, I can't...

1343
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:38,250
I can't defeat this guy?

1344
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,610
Oh, I can!

1345
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:42,010
I just missed every time.

1346
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:51,130
My aim...

1347
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:53,730
Nice, nice.

1348
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:55,010
Yeah, get those...

1349
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:55,810
Get those...

1350
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:57,490
Grorbs!

1351
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:02,290
I can't do this one anymore.

1352
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:02,910
So sad.

1353
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,230
Can I hit the mirror?

1354
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:08,350
Oh, I didn't even notice that right there.

1355
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:09,810
Good to know.

1356
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:10,630
Cool, cool, cool.

1357
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,460
No Beyblade.

1358
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,000
No Beyblade!

1359
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:26,600
Let me see where I'm at in terms of...

1360
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,280
skill.

1361
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,160
Wait, no.

1362
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:34,040
Styles, there we go.

1363
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:34,960
Yes, yeah.

1364
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,780
Upgraded Trickster all the way.

1365
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,880
And Swordmaster, we're...

1366
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,060
close-ish.

1367
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,060
I guess I... What does Trickster give me?

1368
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,100
Wait, no.

1369
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,440
Oh, that's right.

1370
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:51,540
I like Teleport.

1371
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,460
I guess I can refund it and try with Swordmaster instead.

1372
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:58,600
TP.

1373
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:00,980
We'll try this.

1374
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:02,880
Why not?

1375
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:06,700
Swordmaster.

1376
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,720
What's in here?

1377
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:13,100
I guess this is where I'm supposed to go.

1378
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,700
Oh, it's you guys!

1379
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:20,420
Oh my god.

1380
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,200
Wait, I'm scared of you.

1381
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,340
With my fists?

1382
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,180
Oh no.

1383
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,380
Oh my god, wait.

1384
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:31,140
Wait.

1385
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,360
Please, let me move.

1386
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:40,520
No.

1387
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,820
Can I get the other guy, actually, please?

1388
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,000
Like, this guy, yeah.

1389
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:49,720
Ouch!

1390
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,240
No, I'm stuck on the wall.

1391
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,530
I'm using this as an opportunity to learn...

1392
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:04,490
Gerugumish.

1393
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,660
There's another one.

1394
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,500
Oh god, okay, I'm gonna DT.

1395
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,560
Run!

1396
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,190
Holy moly!

1397
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,770
These guys are difficult.

1398
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:39,410
These guys are so tough.

1399
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,390
I don't like it.

1400
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:41,870
I don't like it.

1401
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,110
I'm a sticker!

1402
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,870
I really appreciate being able to fly across the room.

1403
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:59,710
In such a way.

1404
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:00,870
Ouch!

1405
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:33,850
I've become reliant upon...

1406
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:37,370
I've become reliant upon...

1407
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:39,590
upon my sword.

1408
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:43,790
Nice.

1409
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:44,830
Oh, that was a good one.

1410
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:49,950
Okay.

1411
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,760
Yeah, I forgot about my sword master.

1412
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,720
What was it again?

1413
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:24,240
Is it just that I...

1414
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,990
Is that what I unlocked?

1415
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,340
While on the ground, press...

1416
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:50,860
With a rebellion equipped, press...

1417
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,980
RB back plus B.

1418
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,900
They're executing...

1419
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:57,080
Oh wait.

1420
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,480
While on the ground...

1421
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,540
Creepy music.

1422
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:03,460
While on the ground with a rebellion, press B plus Y.

1423
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,540
After executing a drive, press B immediately after...

1424
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:14,770
Back...

1425
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,840
And then B again.

1426
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,200
Wait, I...

1427
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,800
I'm trying, hold on.

1428
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,340
There we go.

1429
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,320
Like that.

1430
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,300
Oh, I was too slow.

1431
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,420
Okay, okay.

1432
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:11,420
Nice.

1433
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,100
Okay, what else was there?

1434
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,480
Don't play fighting games.

1435
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:22,340
I don't remember combos.

1436
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,700
I'll try the same but forward instead.

1437
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,680
That's just...

1438
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,100
Oh wait.

1439
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,300
Sorry, the camera got all of me.

1440
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,820
Get out of here.

1441
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,320
Get out of here.

1442
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,680
Get out of here.

1443
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:55,520
Yeah,

1444
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:00,500
easy combo.

1445
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,920
This is easy.

1446
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,700
And it seems powerful.

1447
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,800
Thank you.

1448
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,540
Okay, so back...

1449
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:12,580
Wait.

1450
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:15,760
Okay, alright.

1451
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,000
I think I can do those.

1452
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,280
Stinger plus combo, yeah.

1453
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,440
That's good.

1454
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:25,980
That's good.

1455
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:28,940
Real impact was that.

1456
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,020
Nope.

1457
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:41,440
While on the ground...

1458
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,700
Oh, this is Gilgamesh.

1459
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,220
Real impact.

1460
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,220
That's like a crazy uppercut.

1461
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,240
Real impact destroys?

1462
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:08,500
Is that why you guys were saying that Gilgamesh is so good?

1463
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,540
I just didn't know the secret technique.

1464
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,520
Let me try it.

1465
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:18,420
Wait.

1466
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:23,380
Wait.

1467
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:25,760
Like that?

1468
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,040
So only the full move you actually hit.

1469
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,020
Okay, but I am...

1470
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,100
Before I am executing it.

1471
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,360
Where did I come in from?

1472
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,360
This is nothing.

1473
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:54,620
Is there anything up here?

1474
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:00,880
What's here?

1475
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:02,900
I can't see.

1476
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:03,540
It's so dark.

1477
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:06,140
Okay.

1478
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,220
And this was the...

1479
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:12,640
The Roarb statue.

1480
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,480
Is there anything down there?

1481
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:21,680
Maybe?

1482
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,680
Oh yeah, there was.

1483
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,260
There's also a secret.

1484
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,120
Real impact the shorter you can can hit an extra time if you double trigger while you're raising a punching.

1485
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,460
This does wildly huge damage.

1486
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,480
I see.

1487
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,400
You see when that hits and you do like four times...

1488
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,640
You guys love this move.

1489
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,720
What is this one?

1490
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,180
Let's see.

1491
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:46,520
Eliminate all enemies without taking damage and without being captured by a fault.

1492
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,320
Sounds boring.

1493
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:53,760
Okay.

1494
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:55,640
Where are we?

1495
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,160
I'm in the mirror.

1496
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,040
Oh wait.

1497
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:03,600
Where are we?

1498
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:14,610
Hold on.

1499
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:16,310
I'm gonna go back out real quick.

1500
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:18,410
Not because I'm lost.

1501
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:21,110
But because...

1502
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:24,490
I'm lost.

1503
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:27,250
Okay, we came from over here.

1504
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:29,890
Oh that's really it.

1505
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,670
Okay, nevermind.

1506
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:31,970
I guess that is where we need to go.

1507
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:32,830
Okay, my bad.

1508
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:48,320
Whoa!

1509
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,120
I hope you guys don't have motion sickness.

1510
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,380
What the hell was that?

1511
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,200
Canoli.

1512
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:10,940
Canoli.

1513
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,520
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1514
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:23,500
This was... Okay, I thought we were in a different area than where we were at.

1515
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:24,960
Please...

1516
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:27,560
So that's why I didn't go through.

1517
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:28,840
Oh, makes sense, makes sense.

1518
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,880
Why can't I just punch it with my fist?

1519
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:33,980
It's just ice.

1520
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,680
It's magical ice.

1521
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:41,700
Yes, regain health and gather orb.

1522
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:45,240
Regain health, gather orb.

1523
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:52,500
Wait, so if I...

1524
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,060
Oh wait, uh, nope.

1525
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:02,560
I missed the chair.

1526
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:09,690
Punch it.

1527
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:18,670
I think it's already lit up, no?

1528
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:23,150
Yeah, it's already lit up.

1529
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:27,750
Let's check out here.

1530
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,560
It's been awfully quiet.

1531
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:35,120
What the heck?

1532
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,140
I'm Spider-Man.

1533
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:39,200
Pardon, welcome to Bamboo Ship.

1534
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:39,920
Thank you.

1535
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:45,980
What is this?

1536
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,480
To proceed further, the power to repel fire must be...

1537
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,240
Oh, that's... Yeah, yeah, I got that.

1538
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,760
Okay, that's what this room is.

1539
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:54,400
Okay, okay.

1540
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,220
Yes, thank you.

1541
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,640
I'm a little lost.

1542
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,720
I'm just a tiny tad bit lost, guys.

1543
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:12,520
I wish I could make Dante's hands into like giant hands.

1544
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:14,960
They hit everything.

1545
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:24,270
I did it!

1546
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:26,670
No, no, back.

1547
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:31,910
I did it!

1548
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:37,010
I did that too.

1549
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:45,450
I'm doing it!

1550
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:46,450
What the hell is that?

1551
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:47,470
Wait, what is that?

1552
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,550
What is that thing?

1553
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:49,630
That's really big.

1554
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,490
Wait, what are you?

1555
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:51,750
What are you?

1556
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:54,570
Come

1557
01:41:58,050 --> 01:41:58,250
on.

1558
01:41:58,290 --> 01:41:58,850
Come on, Dante.

1559
01:41:59,230 --> 01:41:59,870
Do it.

1560
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:06,680
I think I did it.

1561
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,240
Nice.

1562
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:11,230
Nice.

1563
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,300
It's hard for me to time it sometimes, but...

1564
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:25,340
This thing's big.

1565
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,100
Wait, what was the other thing we did?

1566
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,880
What was the other thing I learned?

1567
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:40,580
Other...

1568
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,070
I'm not good at like time...

1569
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:47,750
There we go.

1570
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:53,750
Sucker!

1571
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:56,370
Oh, it was the sword move.

1572
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:57,770
That's right, it was the sword move.

1573
01:42:58,410 --> 01:42:58,930
Thank you.

1574
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:03,110
I like this one now.

1575
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:05,490
Happy to see you enjoying Gilgamesh.

1576
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:09,430
Let's get all these rawr.

1577
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:15,530
Nice.

1578
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:19,810
Get everything off the table.

1579
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:21,070
It's clean now.

1580
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:31,670
Yeah, I like that move.

1581
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:35,230
It's kind of hard for me to get the...

1582
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:36,650
part of it though.

1583
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:38,650
But I'll work on it.

1584
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:39,470
I'll work on it.

1585
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,330
Oh, we're on the other side.

1586
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:42,870
Lovely.

1587
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:53,430
I was going to say, do you think it's in there?

1588
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:54,810
But it does not seem to be.

1589
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:57,590
Or maybe it is.

1590
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:58,770
I don't know.

1591
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:59,670
I'm not a doctor.

1592
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:06,250
The other uppercut move.

1593
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:13,010
I'm getting my uppercuts all mixed up.

1594
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:22,690
There are two.

1595
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:25,270
How do I know if I'm doing one or the other?

1596
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,330
Or rather, how do I...

1597
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:30,090
differentiate with my fingers?

1598
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:33,190
Okay, so not through here.

1599
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:34,770
And not down here.

1600
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:36,510
So we'll go in that other door.

1601
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,080
Hold the button.

1602
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,660
I see.

1603
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:51,420
I was going to say, is this room...

1604
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,220
I know this room always has enemies.

1605
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,540
The torture room.

1606
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:00,060
Wait.

1607
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:06,890
Wait.

1608
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:10,090
Jump.

1609
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:15,110
Wait.

1610
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:17,010
Hold on.

1611
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:17,530
Hold on.

1612
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:17,910
Hold on.

1613
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:20,770
Oh, I did that instead.

1614
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:21,590
Hold on.

1615
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:22,950
Ah.

1616
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:29,640
Ouch.

1617
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,000
Ouch.

1618
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:30,220
Ouch.

1619
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:30,400
Ouch.

1620
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:40,610
Oh my god.

1621
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:41,170
Oh my god.

1622
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:41,750
Oh my god.

1623
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:42,210
Oh my god.

1624
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:42,450
Wait.

1625
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:44,290
I think I'm too... I feel too slow.

1626
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,990
I'm trapped.

1627
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,610
I'm trapped in here.

1628
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:57,490
Wait.

1629
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:04,810
Yeah!

1630
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:07,090
Jump away.

1631
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:17,580
Get out of here.

1632
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,880
Except he didn't do that.

1633
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:25,960
Okay.

1634
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:27,280
Let's try now.

1635
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:29,940
Oh.

1636
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:33,280
That was unfortunate timing.

1637
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:35,260
Wait.

1638
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:49,970
It's a work in progress.

1639
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:53,030
It's a work in progress.

1640
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:57,010
We'll get there.

1641
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:58,450
Do I go down?

1642
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:00,470
Or do I go...

1643
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:03,210
There was a... I think it's the room...

1644
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,190
Is up.

1645
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:07,170
You're doing it?

1646
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:07,770
I am?

1647
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:08,510
You think so?

1648
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:22,830
Down is the way up.

1649
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:27,030
Button mashing goes intense there.

1650
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:27,910
Truly.

1651
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:29,930
Okay.

1652
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:47,250
Do I just... What does this do again?

1653
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:50,710
Oops.

1654
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:55,810
Wait.

1655
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:56,490
Yes.

1656
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:58,210
This is what I was supposed to do.

1657
01:47:58,210 --> 01:47:58,950
Yes.

1658
01:47:59,310 --> 01:47:59,850
Okay.

1659
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,410
No parkour.

1660
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:03,870
We're too good.

1661
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:06,250
Wait.

1662
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:07,590
And then this lowered.

1663
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:08,650
I do remember that.

1664
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:12,150
And there's the torture area down there.

1665
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:14,470
I'm trying not to fall.

1666
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:14,930
Okay.

1667
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:15,110
Okay.

1668
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:15,410
Okay.

1669
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:16,430
Yeah.

1670
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:16,650
Yeah.

1671
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:19,050
Because we lowered that with that thingy right there.

1672
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:20,570
No!

1673
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:49,660
No.

1674
01:49:21,490 --> 01:49:22,990
Show them your new moves.

1675
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:25,110
Yeah.

1676
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:28,990
Ugh.

1677
01:49:35,050 --> 01:49:36,790
She has PTSD already.

1678
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:42,210
It's like the one guy that has taken me multiple lives to kill.

1679
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:49,200
One second.

1680
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:51,640
I've been sitting on it.

1681
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,340
So I got a bracelet in the mail.

1682
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,240
I thought it was cute.

1683
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,120
So I bought it.

1684
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,720
But it came all crinkled.

1685
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,980
Because it's like a PVC.

1686
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,360
So I've been sitting on it.

1687
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:03,020
And I sat on it wrong.

1688
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:07,620
I sat on it wrong.

1689
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:08,840
It became more crinkled.

1690
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:12,800
Whoops.

1691
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,240
He is lightening the rain transform.

1692
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,380
I don't want to play Raiden.

1693
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,220
Is it still wearable?

1694
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:20,640
Yeah.

1695
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,100
I fixed it.

1696
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:22,920
Or I will fix it.

1697
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,040
I'm just sitting on it.

1698
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,400
It's better than it was when I first got it.

1699
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:29,620
We're obsessed with you.

1700
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:30,440
I know.

1701
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:30,660
No.

1702
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,060
I'll buy that bracelet.

1703
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:34,420
No.

1704
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:35,320
It's my bracelet.

1705
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:37,860
I'm just sitting on it.

1706
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,540
Because it's getting nice and toasty.

1707
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:44,020
Just sitting on it.

1708
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:44,660
Uncrinkle it.

1709
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:44,840
Yeah.

1710
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:46,100
Because it's like a plastic.

1711
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:49,180
And so I've been sitting on it.

1712
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,380
I've been heating it up with my bum.

1713
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,000
Okay.

1714
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:07,360
I'm plastic.

1715
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,980
It doesn't poke your butt?

1716
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:10,440
No.

1717
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:13,900
No.

1718
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,060
You can't buy it from me.

1719
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:18,920
It's my special bracelet.

1720
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,180
Why would I sell it if I bought it for me to wear?

1721
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,300
I'm a bird.

1722
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,760
It's my little egg.

1723
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,020
I'm waiting for it to hatch.

1724
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:34,340
Okay.

1725
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,900
I'm not stalling or anything.

1726
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,020
I'm just, you know...

1727
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,420
I'm not stalling or anything.

1728
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,000
Okay.

1729
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:48,280
I'm gonna try and take out those other guys first and then we shoot the other guy.

1730
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:53,760
Oh god.

1731
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:56,560
No.

1732
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:56,640
No.

1733
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:56,840
No.

1734
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:57,040
Please.

1735
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:57,260
No.

1736
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:57,460
Please.

1737
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:57,680
No.

1738
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:58,020
Please.

1739
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:58,540
Go away.

1740
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:01,140
Please go away.

1741
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:02,160
There we go.

1742
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:02,360
Okay.

1743
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,500
That's one guy taken care of.

1744
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,740
Where's the other guy?

1745
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:05,760
He's right there.

1746
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:09,720
Ouch.

1747
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:11,280
Ouch.

1748
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:11,440
Ouch.

1749
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:11,620
Ouch.

1750
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:11,760
Ouch.

1751
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:11,800
Ouch.

1752
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:11,920
Ouch.

1753
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:16,020
Okay.

1754
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:16,460
Ouch.

1755
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:16,840
Ouch.

1756
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:17,000
Ouch.

1757
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:17,200
Ouch.

1758
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:18,340
Oh gosh.

1759
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:20,540
I can't read his moves yet.

1760
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:23,140
Even though I fought him multiple times.

1761
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,360
Bloodslinger.

1762
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:32,220
Where are you?

1763
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:54,430
We're also gaining D.A.T.

1764
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:19,960
Please.

1765
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:20,700
Okay.

1766
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:21,720
There.

1767
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:22,360
Sword.

1768
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,120
No.

1769
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:27,440
Please.

1770
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:28,540
I'm bad.

1771
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,140
Oh no.

1772
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:29,660
Please hold on.

1773
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:30,540
Please hold on.

1774
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:31,320
Please.

1775
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:32,840
Please.

1776
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:35,800
Please.

1777
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:38,000
Please.

1778
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:39,020
Please.

1779
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:39,640
Please.

1780
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,340
I think I messed up you guys.

1781
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:49,660
No.

1782
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:54,380
Oh gosh.

1783
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:55,960
Oh god.

1784
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:07,410
I messed up.

1785
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:08,310
No.

1786
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:08,650
No.

1787
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:08,810
No.

1788
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:09,030
No.

1789
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:10,010
Oh gosh.

1790
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:10,310
Please.

1791
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:16,990
Okay.

1792
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:18,230
I'm just gonna...

1793
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:19,690
No.

1794
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:28,550
No.

1795
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:29,130
Please.

1796
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:30,630
Please leave me alone.

1797
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:31,190
No.

1798
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:32,210
Please leave me alone.

1799
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:33,250
Leave me alone.

1800
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:34,130
Leave me alone.

1801
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:34,390
Please.

1802
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:35,090
Please.

1803
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:36,570
Please leave me alone.

1804
01:54:40,710 --> 01:54:41,210
Ouch.

1805
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,830
I'm on Royal Guard for some reason.

1806
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:45,830
No.

1807
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:47,530
Please.

1808
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:48,470
Leave me alone.

1809
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:49,210
Please.

1810
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:49,570
Please.

1811
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:14,720
When in doubt, play like you're playing DMC2.

1812
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,160
Oh gosh.

1813
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:25,350
Yeah.

1814
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:27,510
Time to go back for that grurb, huh?

1815
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:29,530
Golly.

1816
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:35,450
Please.

1817
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:37,210
High five.

1818
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:38,070
Oh my god.

1819
01:55:40,150 --> 01:55:43,390
My favorite part is when you start playing on hard and these guys start popping.

1820
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:48,370
But it's only stage 3 and you have to fight two of them at the same time.

1821
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:49,590
I could never.

1822
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,520
Thanks for all the silly noises.

1823
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,020
It's not on purpose.

1824
01:56:17,020 --> 01:56:18,720
Should I go back for the grurb?

1825
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:25,000
Should I go back for it?

1826
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,040
Yes.

1827
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:30,320
No.

1828
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:30,800
Yes.

1829
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:31,360
No.

1830
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:34,500
You have plenty of health.

1831
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:35,260
So true.

1832
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:40,240
Look at that grurb up there.

1833
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:41,060
He's huge.

1834
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:46,970
Wow.

1835
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:48,770
Time is beautiful, isn't it?

1836
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:51,130
OK.

1837
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:55,590
Just don't get hit.

1838
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:01,470
Please don't be another guy.

1839
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:01,550
No.

1840
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:06,610
Maybe there's some grurbs in here.

1841
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:11,470
The death brings us life in terms of...

1842
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:13,710
See?

1843
01:57:13,790 --> 01:57:13,950
See?

1844
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:14,090
See?

1845
01:57:16,210 --> 01:57:20,250
They bring us life from their sacrifice.

1846
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:26,740
Oh wow.

1847
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,340
I was gonna say there's gates here now.

1848
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,420
Yeah, I didn't do that one.

1849
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:35,740
I'm getting pops and turvy.

1850
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:41,960
I like just destroying the furniture.

1851
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,320
Grurb.

1852
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:48,100
Grurb.

1853
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:49,160
Grurb.

1854
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:50,760
Grurb.

1855
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:51,340
Grurb.

1856
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:51,700
Please.

1857
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:53,400
Please.

1858
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,160
Won't someone spare me just a little bit of green?

1859
01:57:59,160 --> 01:57:59,620
Wow!

1860
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:00,940
That's a big green!

1861
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,700
Yeah, let's go baby.

1862
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:08,040
Is that a yorb up there?

1863
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:09,820
How do I get to it?

1864
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:12,960
How do I get to that?

1865
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:23,240
Good thing I didn't go all the way back.

1866
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,660
Oh, can't destroy the tree.

1867
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:31,500
How do I get to it?

1868
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:31,860
Oh wait.

1869
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,160
One more statue.

1870
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,420
I have full health.

1871
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:37,900
Let's go.

1872
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:44,430
Take some skill.

1873
01:58:58,670 --> 01:59:01,210
Yeah, I think I have to do the... Can I DT?

1874
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:02,550
I have no DT.

1875
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:08,710
I have no DT.

1876
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:15,830
Where did my bracelet go?

1877
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:20,190
I found it.

1878
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:25,420
Two stars as well.

1879
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,640
I only see the yorb and the rorb.

1880
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:29,480
There's stars up here even?

1881
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:33,100
I kind of want the yorb.

1882
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,320
I already have one, but I think it might be good for a boss battle.

1883
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:37,620
I don't know.

1884
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,140
Devoured by my huge Oshiri.

1885
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:43,520
Why would you say that?

1886
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,700
Why would you say it like that?

1887
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:54,100
I wonder if this area... Oh my goodness, camera please.

1888
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,640
You're really not helping.

1889
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:58,500
It was this one, no?

1890
01:59:58,940 --> 01:59:59,940
I had the secret.

1891
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:03,660
I remembered.

1892
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,720
Did this one have a secret too?

1893
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,260
It did!

1894
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,400
Why would you read that?

1895
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:23,560
I like reading.

1896
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,480
Why are you victim blaming here?

1897
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,120
It's more like, why would you write that?

1898
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:32,900
Why are you blaming me?

1899
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:37,800
I'm the one...

1900
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:43,320
You're like, hey, why did you read that thing about yourself?

1901
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,260
Why did the person type it?

1902
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:57,080
I meant to love you.

1903
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:57,980
Hello!

1904
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:01,600
Thanks.

1905
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:03,320
Devil stars maybe?

1906
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:08,820
I'm so close to a final porb though.

1907
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:12,040
I'm so close to the final porb.

1908
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,760
I wish I could... Oh I have zero.

1909
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,420
I have one M star and one L star.

1910
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:19,320
Actually, I don't think I need to buy any.

1911
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:20,720
Those are some devil stars.

1912
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:21,880
I have two devil stars.

1913
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:23,720
Small.

1914
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,260
Two holy waters!

1915
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,260
Holy moly!

1916
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:31,400
Hi Mito, I see you as a little sister.

1917
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,400
Hi Mustacheman, I see you all over YouTube.

1918
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:41,230
Little sister.

1919
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:44,750
Hopefully you're not a brocon then.

1920
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:48,430
Imagine it's like, I just see you as a little sister.

1921
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:51,050
And I'm a brocon.

1922
02:01:55,470 --> 02:01:57,110
I actually prefer that.

1923
02:01:57,270 --> 02:02:00,650
I prefer if you see me as like, you know, a sister.

1924
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:04,910
Or you could see me as one of your homies.

1925
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:07,290
As just a bro.

1926
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:09,130
We're just hanging out.

1927
02:02:09,370 --> 02:02:10,450
We're just the bros.

1928
02:02:10,450 --> 02:02:12,410
Oh yeah, I would be a siscon.

1929
02:02:12,570 --> 02:02:13,130
You're right.

1930
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:16,710
You're right, you're right.

1931
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:19,370
Or...

1932
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:24,010
Actually, what if they're just like, I see you as my sister and I am a brocon.

1933
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:26,990
I wish you were my brother.

1934
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:32,950
I wish you were...

1935
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:34,810
Is that you?

1936
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:38,310
It's complicated.

1937
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:40,370
You have such complicated feelings, right?

1938
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:43,550
Oh, it's so sad.

1939
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:45,470
I always wanted a brother.

1940
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:48,910
Because I'm a brocon.

1941
02:02:50,330 --> 02:02:52,410
But honestly, I did always want a brother.

1942
02:02:53,970 --> 02:02:55,130
I only have a sister.

1943
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:58,370
And my sister is mean.

1944
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:03,290
And I wanted a big brother to protect me.

1945
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:12,910
Brother-in-law.

1946
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:17,610
Who am I marrying?

1947
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:22,790
Okay, whoever I marry must have a brother.

1948
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:25,830
I guess.

1949
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:28,390
Okay, let's save up for the final porb.

1950
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:31,130
50,000 porb.

1951
02:03:31,710 --> 02:03:32,410
Craziness.

1952
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:33,630
How much?

1953
02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:35,870
How many fragments do I have?

1954
02:03:36,170 --> 02:03:37,310
3 out of 4.

1955
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:38,770
We're close.

1956
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:49,680
Oh, it's stinky in here.

1957
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,180
Smelly.

1958
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:53,560
Woman smell.

1959
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:57,400
It's a big fish man.

1960
02:03:58,140 --> 02:03:59,860
Good morning, my brother.

1961
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,580
Big brother expectations protects you.

1962
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:07,080
Big brother reality sits on you in parts.

1963
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:10,740
I always see you as my brother.

1964
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:14,160
Dante is into it.

1965
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:20,320
Miro is just... Oh my god, he's...

1966
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:29,560
Oh my god, he's literally interpretive dancing for them.

1967
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,700
This is beautiful.

1968
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:33,980
Jump!

1969
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:43,160
So true.

1970
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:49,360
Say it, don't spray it man.

1971
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:00,940
Oh,

1972
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:05,820
nasty.

1973
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:06,720
Oh, I'm frozen.

1974
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:20,730
Shot

1975
02:05:25,550 --> 02:05:26,090
you.

1976
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:26,470
Awesome.

1977
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:27,870
To build some DT.

1978
02:05:29,210 --> 02:05:29,730
Get

1979
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:51,020
real close.

1980
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:51,480
Get nice.

1981
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:58,800
Use Gilgamesh DT for one hit?

1982
02:05:58,860 --> 02:05:59,120
Really?

1983
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:08,660
It's time for sexy lady time.

1984
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:14,510
But I don't want them to catch me.

1985
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:18,410
Nice, they give a lot of roar.

1986
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:21,390
Oh no!

1987
02:06:24,590 --> 02:06:26,610
I got caught.

1988
02:06:27,710 --> 02:06:29,030
I got caught.

1989
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:31,050
He's chomping on me.

1990
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:35,620
Where did he go?

1991
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:41,500
Sexy.

1992
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:45,400
Which I would never say most of the time, but...

1993
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:48,660
You know, this is a specific circumstance.

1994
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:51,900
Stay away, sexy.

1995
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,280
Don't touch me.

1996
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:55,200
DT to escape.

1997
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:55,900
Oh, thank you.

1998
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:08,490
How does he make that really pretty laugh?

1999
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:11,810
You have such a nice laugh, madam.

2000
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:17,070
Stay away from me.

2001
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:21,010
At least I'm doing... I'm doing some damage.

2002
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:31,600
Oh, wait.

2003
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:36,040
Uh-oh.

2004
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:38,300
I'm not anywhere close to him.

2005
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,460
Oh, there we go.

2006
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:44,100
Wait, there we go.

2007
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:56,010
That could have gone better, but...

2008
02:07:56,010 --> 02:07:59,910
That could have gone better, but I did some good damage.

2009
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:04,170
I keep doing the wrong move.

2010
02:08:04,230 --> 02:08:05,270
Yeah, because I'm panicking.

2011
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:08,490
I'm a panicker.

2012
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:10,270
Oh, there they are.

2013
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:12,090
Hello, lady.

2014
02:08:27,290 --> 02:08:28,390
Can I do this here?

2015
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:32,350
Wait, I did the wrong thing.

2016
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:34,150
Oh, wow, that actually worked.

2017
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:37,390
I can't DT.

2018
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:38,310
This sucks.

2019
02:08:39,690 --> 02:08:41,330
I messed up.

2020
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:44,110
I should have just done what I was doing before.

2021
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:50,030
I really screwed that one up.

2022
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:02,060
And he gains... Wait, is he regaining health?

2023
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:02,980
Or am I crazy?

2024
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:05,660
No?

2025
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:11,120
Okay.

2026
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:18,080
Where's the other lady?

2027
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:22,060
Where are you?

2028
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:25,460
Oh, I saw you.

2029
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:29,800
Stinger, my beloved!

2030
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:35,620
Is he gonna come eat me?

2031
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,580
She wishes she could though.

2032
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:47,220
I won't let you.

2033
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:50,880
Okay.

2034
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,780
Sexy lady.

2035
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:58,960
Sexy lady.

2036
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:00,840
Okay.

2037
02:10:08,140 --> 02:10:09,440
Trying to gain some...

2038
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:10,500
Oh my goodness.

2039
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:12,020
Here we go.

2040
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:14,800
Dang it.

2041
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:24,250
Oh my

2042
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:29,060
gosh.

2043
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:30,360
I'm not doing it right.

2044
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:31,780
There we go.

2045
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:39,840
Oh my gosh.

2046
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:40,500
Oh my gosh.

2047
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:41,540
I can't DT.

2048
02:10:41,980 --> 02:10:42,300
No!

2049
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:43,880
Don't eat me!

2050
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:45,380
Don't eat me!

2051
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:47,300
Don't eat me!

2052
02:10:57,460 --> 02:11:00,180
I at least finished with that combo.

2053
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:02,240
Combo combo.

2054
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:09,320
Yeah, I get styled on.

2055
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:11,900
Yeah, I could at least finish with that.

2056
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:21,080
This guy, I think, was not as bad as the other sexy lady.

2057
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:23,920
I love that YouTube font of the sexy lady.

2058
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:29,360
Oh wow, big briefcase.

2059
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,820
I'm going to work.

2060
02:11:36,940 --> 02:11:37,980
It's Dante's...

2061
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:41,040
Salaryman era.

2062
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:41,440
What?

2063
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:43,060
Oh yeah, these guys.

2064
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:44,340
There were more of them, weren't there?

2065
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,020
Oh no.

2066
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:20,370
This doesn't stop!

2067
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:26,020
What is this?

2068
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:28,100
He's gyrating.

2069
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:28,940
Oh my god!

2070
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:31,260
What the...what is this?

2071
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:33,120
It's like a gyroid.

2072
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:34,040
What?

2073
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:57,380
Wait.

2074
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:07,280
A demonic weapon capable of 666 calamitous forms.

2075
02:13:07,740 --> 02:13:10,640
It spells misery and disaster for countless foes.

2076
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:13,980
While on the ground, press X.

2077
02:13:14,540 --> 02:13:18,840
Transform Pandora into a bowgun capable of firing ravaging projectiles.

2078
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:23,140
Successful attacks will increase the disaster gauge.

2079
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:26,440
If you're using gunslinger mode, you can do all of these moves.

2080
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,680
It's great, if confusing to learn.

2081
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:29,140
What?

2082
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:36,460
Change the weapon's form by entering a transformation code while holding X.

2083
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:40,800
How do I use it though?

2084
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:42,360
How do I shoot it?

2085
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:43,000
Oh wait.

2086
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:44,940
What the?

2087
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:47,960
Oh, just like that.

2088
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:49,000
I just let go.

2089
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:52,380
Oh, interesting.

2090
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:55,760
Oh my god!

2091
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:56,160
Wait.

2092
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,520
Is it under sword?

2093
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:07,420
What is it under?

2094
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:09,720
Stability?

2095
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:17,320
Yesterday was my birthday, but I didn't have time to watch yesterday's stream.

2096
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:18,340
No problem, Ren.

2097
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:21,520
I'll be honest, I wouldn't have been able to sing you happy birthday yesterday anyway.

2098
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:23,900
So I can sing you happy birthday today!

2099
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:41,380
One more time!

2100
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:00,110
To the both of you.

2101
02:15:00,910 --> 02:15:02,190
Do I just leave?

2102
02:15:02,830 --> 02:15:04,330
I hope so.

2103
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:09,330
Oh yeah, because we gotta get through the...

2104
02:15:10,850 --> 02:15:12,470
Now all the ice should be gone.

2105
02:15:19,250 --> 02:15:20,290
Happy birthday.

2106
02:15:20,830 --> 02:15:21,470
Happy birthday.

2107
02:15:24,890 --> 02:15:25,450
Next.

2108
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:32,230
It's a bad time to say my birthday.

2109
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:35,530
Why are so many people's birthdays on April Fool's?

2110
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:38,810
You're a Lian god, is that how you say it?

2111
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:43,910
Happy birthday to you!

2112
02:15:44,470 --> 02:15:46,630
Happy birthday to you!

2113
02:15:47,130 --> 02:15:50,050
Happy birthday, Lian god!

2114
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:54,750
Happy birthday to you!

2115
02:15:56,170 --> 02:15:57,110
Happy birthday!

2116
02:15:58,590 --> 02:15:59,810
Mission 16.

2117
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:03,150
Return the Conqueror of the Fire Hell back to his domain.

2118
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:06,930
Is this another boss?

2119
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:10,050
One second real quick.

2120
02:16:10,150 --> 02:16:10,810
There we go.

2121
02:16:11,690 --> 02:16:13,370
There we go.

2122
02:16:14,410 --> 02:16:15,630
Is this another boss?

2123
02:16:18,790 --> 02:16:20,550
Yup, Nero's first boss.

2124
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:22,010
What was the first boss we did?

2125
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:22,710
I'm trying to think.

2126
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:28,670
So the Pandora codes are just moving the analog stick while holding X then releasing.

2127
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:30,850
You'll realize because you'll see the weapon transform.

2128
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:34,110
Let's check it out I suppose.

2129
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:34,890
Pandora.

2130
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:43,950
While holding X, move L, S in any combination of left or right three times.

2131
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:45,910
Revengeance.

2132
02:16:46,490 --> 02:16:51,270
After executing hatred, spin L, S twice in any direction.

2133
02:16:52,550 --> 02:16:53,970
1, 2, 3.

2134
02:16:54,590 --> 02:16:56,890
So I go like 1, 2, 3 and then...

2135
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:03,170
Left, right, left.

2136
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:06,170
And then spin.

2137
02:17:07,290 --> 02:17:08,410
Left, right, left.

2138
02:17:10,170 --> 02:17:11,110
Wiggle that stick.

2139
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:11,770
I'm good at that.

2140
02:17:12,570 --> 02:17:13,190
I can do it.

2141
02:17:14,010 --> 02:17:14,670
We can try it.

2142
02:17:14,730 --> 02:17:15,330
Let's buy it.

2143
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:17,570
Why not?

2144
02:17:21,170 --> 02:17:22,130
Why not?

2145
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:27,890
Oh my gosh, we are so close to...

2146
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:32,610
Did I get any orbs for beating the frog?

2147
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:33,730
I don't think so.

2148
02:17:34,890 --> 02:17:36,430
We got scammed.

2149
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:40,130
Left, right, left, spin!

2150
02:17:42,390 --> 02:17:44,410
It's very good for a specific boss.

2151
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:46,630
It said specific boss.

2152
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:47,870
Coming up.

2153
02:17:49,410 --> 02:17:50,910
I only have 16.

2154
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:52,890
I think...

2155
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:55,670
I was... no, not round trip.

2156
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:57,890
I was going to do maybe...

2157
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:03,860
Styles.

2158
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:07,860
I was thinking of upgrading trickster, but it's ok.

2159
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:10,340
Did they get more expensive?

2160
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:12,380
I thought I remember it being 5,000.

2161
02:18:16,730 --> 02:18:18,070
Ok, mission started.

2162
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:22,630
I'm gonna try it right now.

2163
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:26,930
Oh, great.

2164
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:29,970
Yeah, great.

2165
02:18:31,730 --> 02:18:34,170
Oh, no going back up I suppose.

2166
02:18:35,190 --> 02:18:37,270
They get more expensive the more skills you get.

2167
02:18:37,410 --> 02:18:39,390
Ah, skillflation.

2168
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:45,530
Oh, the stinky room.

2169
02:18:46,990 --> 02:18:48,350
Oh, smells bad.

2170
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:51,710
Oh, it really is.

2171
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:53,510
A poisonous gas permeates the air.

2172
02:18:54,430 --> 02:18:56,370
You must escape before your life is drained.

2173
02:18:59,610 --> 02:19:01,110
Oh, there's more.

2174
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:02,970
No!

2175
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:10,660
Oh, shoot.

2176
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:11,580
It's these guys.

2177
02:19:22,050 --> 02:19:26,930
I don't think I even hit one.

2178
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:32,440
Oh, I can't move it.

2179
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:35,520
Oh, you better just hope that...

2180
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:36,760
Ok, this is not working.

2181
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:40,320
I wish I could grabby-grab these guys.

2182
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:41,120
This sucks.

2183
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,020
Oh, this sucks.

2184
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,040
Oh, shoot.

2185
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:12,740
Oh my gosh.

2186
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:17,320
My life!

2187
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:18,780
My life!

2188
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:24,720
Get a little roar.

2189
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:30,830
I fear I must... Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2190
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:41,620
I fear I should get closer to...

2191
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,020
Oh my goodness.

2192
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:02,340
I'm not good at this.

2193
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:04,000
I'm not good at this.

2194
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:06,500
Please die!

2195
02:21:09,700 --> 02:21:10,800
Shotgun is better.

2196
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,240
Oh gosh.

2197
02:21:32,230 --> 02:21:33,690
Why is this so bad?

2198
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:35,610
Why am I so bad at this?

2199
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:37,430
There we go.

2200
02:21:37,530 --> 02:21:38,490
Oh my gosh, finally.

2201
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:39,910
Please no.

2202
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:41,070
Please get that creature.

2203
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:42,010
Please get that creature.

2204
02:21:42,690 --> 02:21:44,030
Why am I so bad at this?

2205
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:46,110
Hold on.

2206
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:48,350
I

2207
02:21:59,030 --> 02:22:00,130
don't like this at all.

2208
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:03,110
Oh my gosh.

2209
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:05,290
I'm gonna die you guys.

2210
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:07,050
I'm not gonna have to redo this part.

2211
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:08,850
Oh, this sucks.

2212
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:10,670
I don't like it.

2213
02:22:10,730 --> 02:22:11,750
I don't like it.

2214
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:16,930
Please come out of the water.

2215
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:19,750
Please come out and not like that though.

2216
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:22,050
Yeah, I'm dead.

2217
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:30,920
Oh, no.

2218
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:34,880
This part sucks.

2219
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:45,860
We went this way.

2220
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:46,520
Where do I go?

2221
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:48,340
Oh, never mind.

2222
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:49,960
This way!

2223
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,120
DT stinger should pop them out of the water.

2224
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:55,540
It should?

2225
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,620
I don't have much DT, but...

2226
02:23:14,030 --> 02:23:15,130
Okay, that's one.

2227
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:25,490
Okay, I'm running.

2228
02:23:26,050 --> 02:23:27,830
Wait, all my grorbs are gone.

2229
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:29,010
Wait, this sucks.

2230
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:32,550
Wait, all my grorbs are gone.

2231
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:33,190
This sucks.

2232
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:33,990
Oh, no!

2233
02:23:37,010 --> 02:23:37,290
No!

2234
02:23:55,390 --> 02:23:55,870
Somebody

2235
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:04,200
in ivory.

2236
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:06,380
Wait, some people said that the shotgun is better.

2237
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:11,440
Oh, shoot.

2238
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:14,440
Wait, no.

2239
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:19,340
Wait, get that guy.

2240
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:20,980
Get that guy before he goes back in the water.

2241
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:23,420
Okay, that's another guy.

2242
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:24,180
Nice.

2243
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:35,610
Where did he go?

2244
02:24:37,490 --> 02:24:37,970
Hello?

2245
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:51,450
Please come out.

2246
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:56,430
Oh my god.

2247
02:24:56,750 --> 02:24:58,170
I hate these guys.

2248
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:59,930
I miss Nero.

2249
02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:00,870
Dante!

2250
02:25:02,330 --> 02:25:02,870
Please!

2251
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:14,410
Please, let me out.

2252
02:25:14,950 --> 02:25:15,530
Let me out.

2253
02:25:16,050 --> 02:25:16,870
Let me out.

2254
02:25:19,310 --> 02:25:19,770
There we go.

2255
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:25,710
Do you hate them more than the angels in 3?

2256
02:25:25,710 --> 02:25:27,890
I don't know actually.

2257
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:30,490
Oh gosh.

2258
02:25:31,370 --> 02:25:33,610
No, not this again.

2259
02:25:40,290 --> 02:25:43,010
We say enough with your nonsense.

2260
02:25:51,650 --> 02:25:54,070
I can't grab it.

2261
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:54,510
I can't.

2262
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:55,690
Oh, but I can.

2263
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:57,350
Kind of grab it.

2264
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:11,700
Oh my gosh.

2265
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:13,660
Ouch, ouch.

2266
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:15,700
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2267
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:22,830
You know what?

2268
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:23,270
Screw it.

2269
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:28,370
Wait, can one of you plant into the ground again, please?

2270
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:39,400
I got one.

2271
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:40,460
Let's go.

2272
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:42,400
I got two.

2273
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:43,900
Three.

2274
02:26:54,730 --> 02:26:55,210
Ouch.

2275
02:26:56,610 --> 02:26:59,810
Wait, wait, wait.

2276
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:03,830
I thought I was on trickster for a second.

2277
02:27:04,210 --> 02:27:05,230
Oh wait, I think I missed it.

2278
02:27:12,690 --> 02:27:14,210
Trickster, trickster, trickster.

2279
02:27:14,630 --> 02:27:15,110
There we go.

2280
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:22,540
There we go.

2281
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:26,120
No please.

2282
02:27:26,460 --> 02:27:27,540
Ouch, I was trying to get that guy.

2283
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:29,440
Do they ever stop?

2284
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:35,840
There we go.

2285
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:37,620
Yeah!

2286
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:41,670
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2287
02:28:09,050 --> 02:28:10,410
Oh my goodness, please.

2288
02:28:12,410 --> 02:28:13,750
I'm gonna grab this roar.

2289
02:28:16,290 --> 02:28:17,150
Where are you?

2290
02:28:17,690 --> 02:28:18,170
Oh.

2291
02:28:19,210 --> 02:28:19,610
Come here.

2292
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:31,480
Was that the trick?

2293
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:34,880
Wait, could I have left at any time?

2294
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:45,320
Oh, but what about the blue?

2295
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:47,520
Wait a second, no way!

2296
02:28:48,220 --> 02:28:49,060
It was blue!

2297
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:52,540
There was the blue!

2298
02:28:53,060 --> 02:28:54,300
There was the blue!

2299
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:56,040
There was the blue!

2300
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:57,040
Wait!

2301
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:58,800
There was the blue!

2302
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:00,400
No way!

2303
02:29:08,910 --> 02:29:09,870
Nice.

2304
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:16,350
No way.

2305
02:29:16,910 --> 02:29:18,410
I could have left at any time.

2306
02:29:20,670 --> 02:29:22,490
That's so stupid.

2307
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:31,900
They tricked me!

2308
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:33,620
Oh shoot.

2309
02:29:44,970 --> 02:29:46,930
At least my health is not doing so poorly.

2310
02:29:52,610 --> 02:29:53,410
OK.

2311
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:57,750
It was a good red orb farm though.

2312
02:29:58,390 --> 02:30:03,630
Yeah, that's totally why I did it.

2313
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:22,920
There we go.

2314
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:26,640
We're so close to the last orb.

2315
02:30:27,360 --> 02:30:31,420
I can't believe I got bamboozled.

2316
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:39,180
Actually, I can't believe it.

2317
02:30:40,580 --> 02:30:41,740
Maybe I can't believe it.

2318
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:43,140
Donkey Kong?

2319
02:30:44,220 --> 02:30:45,260
Oh no!

2320
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:46,340
We're back in!

2321
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:47,980
Come on, seriously?

2322
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:52,080
How dare they bamboozle me.

2323
02:30:58,900 --> 02:31:01,420
Wait, what if I...

2324
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:01,720
Wait.

2325
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:08,100
He's pretty good.

2326
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:14,340
How did I start doing that?

2327
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:20,680
What?

2328
02:31:20,980 --> 02:31:22,440
I'm not trying to do that!

2329
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:23,800
Get me out of here!

2330
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:25,440
I don't like this.

2331
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:29,660
Wait.

2332
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:35,480
I'm trying to... It's because I'm on Gunslinger.

2333
02:31:35,540 --> 02:31:36,300
I'm such an idiot.

2334
02:31:39,640 --> 02:31:41,180
I'm on Gunslinger.

2335
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:42,240
That's why.

2336
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:50,620
Please.

2337
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:52,840
No, I'm too slow.

2338
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:53,560
I'm too slow.

2339
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:02,450
There.

2340
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:04,810
Like that.

2341
02:32:04,810 --> 02:32:06,950
That's what I'm trying to do.

2342
02:32:08,490 --> 02:32:09,270
Golly.

2343
02:32:10,270 --> 02:32:11,410
You're too slow.

2344
02:32:13,290 --> 02:32:15,050
You're too slow.

2345
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:17,490
I was too slow.

2346
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:20,030
This way.

2347
02:32:25,610 --> 02:32:26,090
Right?

2348
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:28,510
Actually, which way?

2349
02:32:28,830 --> 02:32:29,230
Which way?

2350
02:32:29,910 --> 02:32:31,270
Wait, I'm lost.

2351
02:32:32,270 --> 02:32:34,710
Guys, I'm lost.

2352
02:32:34,810 --> 02:32:35,650
The map doesn't help.

2353
02:32:38,350 --> 02:32:38,950
Oh!

2354
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:39,750
Oh!

2355
02:32:40,550 --> 02:32:41,130
I see.

2356
02:32:41,930 --> 02:32:43,350
Tiny map doesn't help.

2357
02:32:43,470 --> 02:32:45,750
Big map...good idea.

2358
02:32:46,510 --> 02:32:48,210
Wait, so then I...

2359
02:32:48,210 --> 02:32:51,770
I go underneath.

2360
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:52,890
Wrong way.

2361
02:32:52,970 --> 02:32:54,670
Yeah, I'm so lost in the sauce right now.

2362
02:32:58,390 --> 02:32:58,710
Call?

2363
02:32:59,130 --> 02:32:59,590
Wait.

2364
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:13,880
The circular cage has a gap you can jump through.

2365
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:16,020
That gap.

2366
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:17,740
I'm so lost.

2367
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:19,060
In here?

2368
02:33:24,230 --> 02:33:27,250
Ok, I do remember the...

2369
02:33:27,250 --> 02:33:29,150
Oh, come on.

2370
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:30,890
You're welcome.

2371
02:33:30,890 --> 02:33:31,430
Damn.

2372
02:33:43,540 --> 02:33:44,600
Yeah, you wanna...

2373
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:03,540
Why

2374
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:25,310
am I...Oh, I think I need to hold it, right?

2375
02:34:26,290 --> 02:34:26,770
No?

2376
02:34:30,210 --> 02:34:30,850
I'm confused.

2377
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:40,680
I'm so confused how to do this, though.

2378
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:43,820
I am doing...Maybe it's because the camera...

2379
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:45,180
Ouch.

2380
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:46,260
Ouch.

2381
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:46,580
Ouch.

2382
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:50,840
Oh, come on!

2383
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:52,120
Dante!

2384
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:54,040
Dante.

2385
02:34:54,740 --> 02:34:55,040
Dante.

2386
02:35:20,380 --> 02:35:24,160
Ok, I give up.

2387
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:24,800
I give up.

2388
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:32,000
Oh

2389
02:35:42,010 --> 02:35:43,030
my god.

2390
02:36:01,970 --> 02:36:02,650
This

2391
02:36:07,570 --> 02:36:10,910
is no longer pain...Oh, it is no longer painful to breathe.

2392
02:36:12,110 --> 02:36:12,790
Finally.

2393
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:17,310
Painful

2394
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:39,170
to breathe, says you.

2395
02:36:40,370 --> 02:36:41,690
It's painful for me.

2396
02:36:45,090 --> 02:36:46,910
It's painful for me.

2397
02:36:52,630 --> 02:36:54,750
Oh, we're back inside.

2398
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:08,240
By eliminating its source, the magical barrier of ice has been melted.

2399
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:11,200
Yeah, looks like you will be able to leave the castle now.

2400
02:37:11,780 --> 02:37:12,340
Yippee!

2401
02:37:17,930 --> 02:37:19,650
We're at 5,000!

2402
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:20,490
Or 50,000!

2403
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:21,870
Hold on.

2404
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:25,280
Let's get our final orb.

2405
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:31,960
I will have literally two orbs to my name.

2406
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:34,520
Yippee!

2407
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:42,960
Two orbs to my name!

2408
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:45,380
KZU, welcome to membership.

2409
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:46,320
Thank you.

2410
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:51,540
Nothing there?

2411
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:51,860
Ok.

2412
02:37:57,620 --> 02:37:59,020
Oh, that's not what I meant.

2413
02:37:59,080 --> 02:37:59,420
There we go.

2414
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:03,340
I can DT for like two seconds.

2415
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:07,840
Here.

2416
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:08,380
Ok.

2417
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:09,880
We're gonna do it.

2418
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:16,940
Was it worth it?

2419
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:18,180
Maybe.

2420
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:22,400
Mr. Matt Johnson, welcome to membership.

2421
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:23,100
Thank you.

2422
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:27,500
Yeah, what's my disaster gauge?

2423
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:31,720
It said that I have a disaster gauge since I got Pandora.

2424
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:34,600
But it did not explain what it is.

2425
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:42,160
The purple bar.

2426
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:42,780
Yeah, I know.

2427
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:43,920
But what is it?

2428
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:44,440
What does it mean?

2429
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:46,140
What does it do?

2430
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:48,760
It fills using Pandora.

2431
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:50,120
Yeah, I know, but what does it do?

2432
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:54,080
It's for gunslinger moves of Pandora.

2433
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:54,960
Ah, ok.

2434
02:38:57,820 --> 02:38:59,200
I see, I see.

2435
02:39:04,050 --> 02:39:05,790
La la la, I'm leaving.

2436
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:08,210
Where's the heat guy?

2437
02:39:09,690 --> 02:39:11,090
How far away is he?

2438
02:39:12,850 --> 02:39:18,590
This is where we first met sexy Trish.

2439
02:39:21,730 --> 02:39:23,150
I'm feeling the heat.

2440
02:39:36,930 --> 02:39:37,850
Come here boy.

2441
02:39:38,070 --> 02:39:38,590
Come here boy.

2442
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:42,350
Oh, he just... Oh my god.

2443
02:39:42,710 --> 02:39:43,310
Oh, dog.

2444
02:39:43,470 --> 02:39:44,690
This is...

2445
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:46,030
Oh, mini dogs.

2446
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:05,020
I lost a lot of health though.

2447
02:40:20,830 --> 02:40:21,830
Twinkle dogs?

2448
02:40:21,950 --> 02:40:22,770
They wish.

2449
02:40:22,770 --> 02:40:25,110
They wish they could be twinkle dogs.

2450
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:36,740
Diamond dogs.

2451
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:44,480
Oh, they are all shooting at once.

2452
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:49,250
Ok.

2453
02:40:49,770 --> 02:40:50,310
Alright.

2454
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:51,670
I should probably fight them now.

2455
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:55,650
They are so fast.

2456
02:40:57,950 --> 02:40:58,590
Ouch.

2457
02:40:59,910 --> 02:41:00,550
Goodbye.

2458
02:41:22,780 --> 02:41:23,140
Meow.

2459
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:26,540
Tread Pandora.

2460
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:37,540
But the thing is that... Oh, you can direct it like this.

2461
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:40,140
But you can't move it side to side which kind of sucks.

2462
02:41:44,690 --> 02:41:46,770
DT singer is really the solution to everything.

2463
02:41:46,910 --> 02:41:47,690
It feels that way, huh?

2464
02:41:47,850 --> 02:41:49,110
Oh, this is where we came from.

2465
02:41:50,010 --> 02:41:50,590
My bad.

2466
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:55,320
Okie dokie.

2467
02:41:57,280 --> 02:41:58,180
I know.

2468
02:41:58,340 --> 02:41:59,140
Stinger is really...

2469
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:03,000
Such a lovely tool.

2470
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:06,780
Such a lovely little trick they have given us.

2471
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:08,180
Ah, yeah baby.

2472
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:09,720
No more?

2473
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:11,800
Stingy.

2474
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:22,940
Pandora seems to have a big learning curve.

2475
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:24,340
Perhaps.

2476
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:26,680
Wait, is it not this way?

2477
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:28,740
Oh, here.

2478
02:42:30,340 --> 02:42:30,900
That's right.

2479
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:31,460
I remember.

2480
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:35,380
I love backtracking.

2481
02:42:45,190 --> 02:42:45,750
Slippery.

2482
02:42:57,750 --> 02:42:58,870
More dogs!

2483
02:43:01,550 --> 02:43:02,370
Where am I?

2484
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:04,250
Come here.

2485
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:12,620
Come here dog.

2486
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:27,900
Stop being so fast!

2487
02:43:32,030 --> 02:43:34,710
Oh, that's not at all where I should be.

2488
02:43:39,570 --> 02:43:41,310
These guys aren't so tough.

2489
02:43:43,310 --> 02:43:45,710
Can you tell they ran out of level by halfway through?

2490
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:55,200
Don't fall off the edge.

2491
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:57,420
Don't fall off the edge.

2492
02:43:58,160 --> 02:43:59,820
Don't fall off.

2493
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:03,360
Don't fall off the edge.

2494
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:08,410
Grab that roar.

2495
02:44:09,530 --> 02:44:10,830
Grab that roar.

2496
02:44:11,850 --> 02:44:12,190
Nice.

2497
02:44:12,730 --> 02:44:13,250
Do a flip!

2498
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:19,960
Long level.

2499
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:24,260
Wait, what's this way?

2500
02:44:26,300 --> 02:44:26,860
Open?

2501
02:44:31,510 --> 02:44:35,670
I like remember these areas and I'm also like...

2502
02:44:37,510 --> 02:44:38,370
Oh, see?

2503
02:44:38,810 --> 02:44:40,670
I remember going through here.

2504
02:44:41,570 --> 02:44:43,090
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

2505
02:44:43,790 --> 02:44:44,590
What's up here?

2506
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:49,050
Oh, we can't go...

2507
02:44:49,050 --> 02:44:50,190
Oh, look how cute!

2508
02:44:50,730 --> 02:44:52,210
Who's working down here?

2509
02:44:55,290 --> 02:44:56,650
Yeah, they existed.

2510
02:45:01,490 --> 02:45:02,090
Who's

2511
02:45:05,380 --> 02:45:05,980
still...

2512
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:07,260
Ok, easy.

2513
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:08,380
Easy Dante.

2514
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:09,480
Nice!

2515
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,540
Good job Dante.

2516
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:11,240
Oh!

2517
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:13,040
Oh no, that's not a roar.

2518
02:45:16,260 --> 02:45:17,140
This way?

2519
02:45:18,220 --> 02:45:19,320
But what is over here?

2520
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:22,240
Oh, I think that's wrong.

2521
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:24,060
Up top.

2522
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:25,620
Up top!

2523
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:29,340
And then what's over here?

2524
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:44,680
Sword.

2525
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:48,380
What's over here?

2526
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:49,020
Nothing.

2527
02:45:49,400 --> 02:45:50,480
What's over here?

2528
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:51,240
Exit.

2529
02:45:52,020 --> 02:45:53,100
We are so rich!

2530
02:45:53,420 --> 02:45:54,620
Oh no!

2531
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:55,480
Wait!

2532
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:01,620
Oh yeah, this guy!

2533
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:06,480
Oh my god.

2534
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:11,580
Wait, isn't the enemy of my enemy my friend?

2535
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:12,360
No?

2536
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:21,040
We can work together and get rid of that guy, no?

2537
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:25,360
Oh yeah.

2538
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:33,640
No, still enemy.

2539
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:35,680
That's sad.

2540
02:46:51,190 --> 02:46:52,890
That does some damage.

2541
02:46:53,710 --> 02:46:55,770
Put your shades on, we got him.

2542
02:46:57,770 --> 02:46:58,530
Please.

2543
02:47:00,190 --> 02:47:02,150
Oh, I can't turn sideways everybody.

2544
02:47:25,320 --> 02:47:26,840
Absolutely nothing.

2545
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:28,320
That's so unfortunate.

2546
02:47:29,360 --> 02:47:30,740
That's so sad.

2547
02:47:31,400 --> 02:47:32,500
That did nothing.

2548
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:37,960
It actually did nothing.

2549
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:38,260
Nothing.

2550
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:42,380
I fired it at the ground.

2551
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:45,260
Pandora is hard.

2552
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:48,700
Pandora is hard.

2553
02:47:49,540 --> 02:47:50,740
He was right in front of me.

2554
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:51,640
How could I miss?

2555
02:48:00,370 --> 02:48:01,830
Let's actually play.

2556
02:48:02,410 --> 02:48:03,670
Let's actually fight.

2557
02:48:03,890 --> 02:48:04,370
Here we go.

2558
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:06,230
I don't want you.

2559
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:09,130
Let's build up some DT.

2560
02:48:09,130 --> 02:48:11,470
Is it only good if I hit his head?

2561
02:48:41,070 --> 02:48:42,310
Wait, oh shoot.

2562
02:48:42,490 --> 02:48:43,130
I should've...

2563
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:46,150
Ouch, ouch.

2564
02:48:54,570 --> 02:48:55,150
Yes.

2565
02:48:57,050 --> 02:48:58,210
Come here.

2566
02:49:11,100 --> 02:49:13,290
I was like, I'm gonna regret this probably.

2567
02:49:14,370 --> 02:49:14,930
Ouch.

2568
02:49:16,650 --> 02:49:17,450
Ouch, ouch.

2569
02:49:18,330 --> 02:49:18,970
Ouch.

2570
02:49:19,390 --> 02:49:22,390
I think I dodged right into his socks.

2571
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:33,820
He got me with his back legs even.

2572
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:39,040
Damn it, I pressed the wrong button.

2573
02:49:39,220 --> 02:49:39,820
I'm so stupid.

2574
02:49:46,650 --> 02:49:47,290
Nice.

2575
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:54,670
I did the wrong move.

2576
02:49:56,330 --> 02:49:57,050
I

2577
02:50:01,490 --> 02:50:03,730
finished with it!

2578
02:50:04,310 --> 02:50:09,930
I did it!

2579
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:19,150
With

2580
02:50:22,820 --> 02:50:25,260
one bullet.

2581
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:27,640
Hehehe.

2582
02:50:35,970 --> 02:50:38,070
I'm so proud of myself.

2583
02:50:38,470 --> 02:50:40,810
I was able to do it on the last shot.

2584
02:50:40,910 --> 02:50:41,850
On the last hit.

2585
02:50:48,510 --> 02:50:49,950
What is...

2586
02:50:49,950 --> 02:50:51,430
What is going on?

2587
02:51:30,110 --> 02:51:30,210
Ah!

2588
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:48,640
Damn.

2589
02:52:07,550 --> 02:52:09,050
First I whip it out.

2590
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:25,900
Wow!

2591
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:29,800
I'm literally crying.

2592
02:52:31,380 --> 02:52:33,120
That was a masterpiece.

2593
02:52:44,550 --> 02:52:45,310
Wow.

2594
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:48,630
In the end we are all satisfied.

2595
02:52:48,710 --> 02:52:50,810
He was talking about his sword.

2596
02:52:51,410 --> 02:52:53,170
Like with a sword, right?

2597
02:52:53,170 --> 02:53:00,950
I love so much that the game springs that on you and then expects you to go about your business.

2598
02:53:01,310 --> 02:53:02,810
As if it never happened.

2599
02:53:03,750 --> 02:53:05,170
I want to know what the...

2600
02:53:05,830 --> 02:53:10,640
I want to know what the room was like when someone proposed that.

2601
02:53:12,740 --> 02:53:17,200
You know, like someone went into work that day and was just like...

2602
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:21,420
Okay, what if we just introduce this musical number out of nowhere.

2603
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:35,180
Lucifer, a hellish...

2604
02:53:38,850 --> 02:53:45,750
A hellish weapon capable of summoning an infinite number of exploding blades that hover ominously in the air.

2605
02:53:46,210 --> 02:53:50,950
I love how in the cutscenes the power-ups are so cool, but then you actually use them and they are not as cool.

2606
02:53:51,250 --> 02:53:52,270
I get it.

2607
02:53:52,270 --> 02:53:53,830
Like I get it, but it's just funny.

2608
02:53:54,170 --> 02:53:55,710
No, it's so cool.

2609
02:53:57,470 --> 02:53:57,990
Wow.

2610
02:53:59,490 --> 02:54:03,190
I feel like I only want to use Lucifer because I...

2611
02:54:04,670 --> 02:54:05,830
Sexy Spanish guitar.

2612
02:54:05,870 --> 02:54:09,410
I know when the guitar started playing I was like where is this music coming from?

2613
02:54:09,750 --> 02:54:11,370
And then it was a full number.

2614
02:54:12,150 --> 02:54:15,490
From what I remember, all that stuff he said was improvised by the VA.

2615
02:54:15,610 --> 02:54:16,490
No way.

2616
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:18,730
In JP too?

2617
02:54:21,930 --> 02:54:25,250
Every cutscene in this game feels like the devs are having a little too much fun.

2618
02:54:25,370 --> 02:54:28,130
You know what, that's the best way to make a game, no?

2619
02:54:29,270 --> 02:54:33,950
Nero is having the worst moment of his life and this guy is collecting weapons and messing around.

2620
02:54:36,570 --> 02:54:39,710
Nero is like dissolving into darkness.

2621
02:54:41,410 --> 02:54:47,850
Nero is dissolving into darkness with his girlfriend and here we are being like first time, whip it out.

2622
02:54:52,140 --> 02:54:54,740
Oh, JP voice acting didn't exist in this game.

2623
02:54:55,700 --> 02:54:56,820
I see.

2624
02:54:57,280 --> 02:54:57,920
I see.

2625
02:54:59,620 --> 02:55:00,700
That's even better.

2626
02:55:03,240 --> 02:55:05,920
Position swords around you and pierce your enemies repeatedly.

2627
02:55:06,580 --> 02:55:08,400
I like it's why why why why?

2628
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:10,740
I assume.

2629
02:55:10,980 --> 02:55:12,300
What's the dot dot dot dot for?

2630
02:55:16,360 --> 02:55:18,220
Wait, can we see the big guy from here?

2631
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:19,500
No.

2632
02:55:19,660 --> 02:55:20,780
It would be cool if we could see him.

2633
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,700
Oh wait I'm still in DT, oh my goodness.

2634
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:37,780
Always press Y.

2635
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:41,680
Sorry, I turned it up because that song was so good.

2636
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:47,280
Now taunt...

2637
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:51,180
But...

2638
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:52,680
Come on.

2639
02:55:56,530 --> 02:55:57,430
Come on.

2640
02:55:58,290 --> 02:55:59,210
Come on.

2641
02:55:59,450 --> 02:56:02,130
Come on.

2642
02:56:02,130 --> 02:56:04,150
Is Nero dissolving that important?

2643
02:56:04,390 --> 02:56:05,610
Gotta have the right priorities.

2644
02:56:05,810 --> 02:56:06,390
So true.

2645
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:07,950
Okay.

2646
02:56:08,950 --> 02:56:09,610
Up, up.

2647
02:56:10,250 --> 02:56:11,130
Wait, this way.

2648
02:56:11,890 --> 02:56:12,550
Wait, yeah.

2649
02:56:13,050 --> 02:56:14,050
I'll practice with it.

2650
02:56:20,020 --> 02:56:20,840
Oh my...

2651
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:23,340
Oh, yeah, I totally beat the boss with that.

2652
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:27,820
BAB!

2653
02:56:28,980 --> 02:56:29,500
BAB!

2654
02:56:36,030 --> 02:56:36,950
Just a BAB.

2655
02:56:37,410 --> 02:56:37,990
Just a BABy.

2656
02:56:39,530 --> 02:56:40,050
Oh...

2657
02:56:41,710 --> 02:56:45,270
I think I might call it here, guys.

2658
02:56:45,950 --> 02:56:48,090
Next time we should be able to finish, no?

2659
02:56:48,970 --> 02:56:50,990
We'll have a few more missions left?

2660
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:52,110
What?

2661
02:56:52,190 --> 02:56:52,630
This was...

2662
02:56:52,630 --> 02:56:53,550
This was 17.

2663
02:56:53,690 --> 02:56:54,510
Oh, hold on.

2664
02:56:55,150 --> 02:56:55,590
Mission...

2665
02:56:55,590 --> 02:56:56,970
If I go to next, let's see.

2666
02:56:59,110 --> 02:56:59,550
Yes.

2667
02:57:01,790 --> 02:57:02,870
That was Peak Cinema.

2668
02:57:03,090 --> 02:57:04,230
Have you played DMCV?

2669
02:57:04,810 --> 02:57:05,290
If not...

2670
02:57:05,290 --> 02:57:06,390
No, I'm going in.

2671
02:57:07,130 --> 02:57:07,950
I'm going in.

2672
02:57:08,290 --> 02:57:08,530
It's B.

2673
02:57:08,710 --> 02:57:09,970
Oh, like it's in Metal Gear.

2674
02:57:09,970 --> 02:57:11,870
No, I haven't played 5 yet.

2675
02:57:12,510 --> 02:57:12,990
I'm...

2676
02:57:14,110 --> 02:57:15,790
I'm going in...

2677
02:57:15,790 --> 02:57:17,070
Release in order.

2678
02:57:17,590 --> 02:57:17,990
So...

2679
02:57:17,990 --> 02:57:21,570
And this is my first time ever playing the series, so...

2680
02:57:21,570 --> 02:57:21,950
Yeah.

2681
02:57:22,070 --> 02:57:22,430
Oh, okay.

2682
02:57:22,510 --> 02:57:23,190
That was...

2683
02:57:23,190 --> 02:57:23,990
That was 6.

2684
02:57:24,110 --> 02:57:25,210
Oh, I thought we were...

2685
02:57:25,210 --> 02:57:26,450
I thought we just did 17.

2686
02:57:26,930 --> 02:57:29,670
So now we have 17, 18, 19, 20.

2687
02:57:29,730 --> 02:57:30,430
So 4 left.

2688
02:57:30,990 --> 02:57:32,130
I thought that was 17.

2689
02:57:32,470 --> 02:57:33,730
I'm all mixed up.

2690
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:38,390
V...

2691
02:57:40,310 --> 02:57:41,610
V has come to...

2692
02:57:43,190 --> 02:57:45,470
Check Sword Master moves for Lucifer.

2693
02:57:51,430 --> 02:57:52,150
Pin up.

2694
02:57:52,530 --> 02:57:55,270
Throw multiple swords and position them in the air in front of you.

2695
02:57:58,050 --> 02:57:59,310
What do the swords do?

2696
02:57:59,410 --> 02:58:00,310
Do they just pierce?

2697
02:58:01,310 --> 02:58:02,090
Well, I'll buy it.

2698
02:58:03,110 --> 02:58:05,090
But I'll look at that again next time.

2699
02:58:05,850 --> 02:58:06,370
So, yeah.

2700
02:58:06,530 --> 02:58:07,610
We should be able to...

2701
02:58:08,390 --> 02:58:10,030
Which DMC has been your favorite so far?

2702
02:58:10,110 --> 02:58:11,130
I'm going to have to say this one.

2703
02:58:11,130 --> 02:58:11,930
I'm not going to lie.

2704
02:58:12,070 --> 02:58:14,010
Oh, so the explosion does do damage.

2705
02:58:21,410 --> 02:58:21,770
Woo!

2706
02:58:21,990 --> 02:58:22,710
Prince of Denmark!

2707
02:58:23,330 --> 02:58:25,830
I didn't want to distract you during gameplay, so I waited until now.

2708
02:58:25,890 --> 02:58:30,290
I just wanted to tell you how much I value hiding out in your livestream when I get the chance.

2709
02:58:31,930 --> 02:58:32,650
Thank you!

2710
02:58:34,710 --> 02:58:36,010
Thanks for hiding out.

2711
02:58:37,550 --> 02:58:38,970
You did say hiding, right?

2712
02:58:39,350 --> 02:58:39,710
Yeah.

2713
02:58:41,450 --> 02:58:42,670
I appreciate it.

2714
02:58:42,670 --> 02:58:43,790
You're going to love 5 then?

2715
02:58:43,950 --> 02:58:44,370
Oh my gosh.

2716
02:58:44,590 --> 02:58:46,250
My friends have been telling me that too.

2717
02:58:46,390 --> 02:58:47,130
They're like...

2718
02:58:47,770 --> 02:58:50,490
They were saying that most people are probably waiting for me to get to 5.

2719
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:52,950
Because that's like the peak of peak.

2720
02:58:53,550 --> 02:58:53,730
No?

2721
02:58:55,010 --> 02:58:56,130
I'm so excited.

2722
02:58:56,410 --> 02:58:56,890
Oh my gosh!

2723
02:58:56,930 --> 02:58:58,230
I'm so excited to get to 5!

2724
02:59:00,850 --> 02:59:03,530
Are you planning on playing the reboot before 5?

2725
02:59:03,590 --> 02:59:06,910
Because it's technically released first, even though it's unconnected.

2726
02:59:07,250 --> 02:59:08,250
Probably not.

2727
02:59:09,030 --> 02:59:11,150
Probably we'll just go until 5.

2728
02:59:23,790 --> 02:59:24,350
True.

2729
02:59:25,470 --> 02:59:26,350
It's cute though.

2730
02:59:26,430 --> 02:59:27,070
It's cute.

2731
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:28,530
I like Nero a lot.

2732
02:59:29,110 --> 02:59:30,090
I do like that guy.

2733
02:59:30,170 --> 02:59:31,310
He's my little baby boy.

2734
02:59:33,130 --> 02:59:34,890
He's my little baby boy.

2735
02:59:34,890 --> 02:59:37,050
The best way to end the stream.

2736
02:59:37,090 --> 02:59:38,210
You did some good gaming tonight.

2737
02:59:38,290 --> 02:59:39,070
Thank you!

2738
02:59:40,850 --> 02:59:42,890
I just want you to know I see you like a sister.

2739
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:44,570
Questionable intent.

2740
02:59:45,890 --> 02:59:46,370
Oh no!

2741
02:59:46,450 --> 02:59:47,510
We got the sis card!

2742
02:59:50,470 --> 02:59:51,790
Wait, what if it's like...

2743
02:59:51,790 --> 02:59:54,790
I see you as a sister, but as in like a Maria-sama...

2744
02:59:54,790 --> 02:59:58,590
Maria-sama ga miteiru way of sister, you know?

2745
02:59:58,810 --> 03:00:00,630
Where it's like a holy sister.

2746
03:00:00,910 --> 03:00:01,710
And it's like...

2747
03:00:01,710 --> 03:00:03,350
Oh yeah, you're a sexy nun.

2748
03:00:06,750 --> 03:00:07,910
Okay, I've decided.

2749
03:00:08,050 --> 03:00:09,590
I'm going to do a nun outfit then.

2750
03:00:10,070 --> 03:00:12,370
And so then I can say you see me as a sister.

2751
03:00:14,530 --> 03:00:15,770
Like Mari from BA.

2752
03:00:16,110 --> 03:00:17,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2753
03:00:21,990 --> 03:00:23,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2754
03:00:25,410 --> 03:00:25,850
Sister.

2755
03:00:27,530 --> 03:00:28,410
Holy sister.

2756
03:00:29,770 --> 03:00:30,250
Oh...

2757
03:00:32,730 --> 03:00:34,790
This was so much fun though today.

2758
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:37,950
Oh man, we really got through a bunch.

2759
03:00:38,070 --> 03:00:39,050
So we have four missions.

2760
03:00:39,370 --> 03:00:40,670
How many missions did I get through today?

2761
03:00:41,550 --> 03:00:43,030
IDK if you're holy enough for that.

2762
03:00:43,250 --> 03:00:43,530
What?

2763
03:00:44,630 --> 03:00:46,730
I'm literally the holy...

2764
03:00:46,730 --> 03:00:48,570
I'm a holy spirit.

2765
03:00:50,650 --> 03:00:54,010
The manual for DMC4 had a little blurb about the characters.

2766
03:00:54,010 --> 03:00:58,330
And describes Kirie as both a sister and mother to Nero.

2767
03:01:16,100 --> 03:01:18,220
Yeah, sister as in a nun.

2768
03:01:18,900 --> 03:01:20,120
She is a sister.

2769
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:21,400
She's a nun.

2770
03:01:23,540 --> 03:01:24,240
Mother?

2771
03:01:26,520 --> 03:01:27,440
I don't know.

2772
03:01:29,020 --> 03:01:33,300
Sister Minky, I'm here to confess my love for Kirie.

2773
03:01:35,780 --> 03:01:37,860
That reminds me of Fruits Basket.

2774
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:39,980
Do you guys know Fruits Basket?

2775
03:01:40,360 --> 03:01:42,400
The anime manga.

2776
03:01:43,320 --> 03:01:46,140
I really loved Toru with Yuki.

2777
03:01:48,280 --> 03:01:52,760
When I first read it when I was a young wisp, I really liked Toru with Kyo.

2778
03:01:53,380 --> 03:01:55,540
And I never finished the series.

2779
03:01:56,120 --> 03:01:58,820
And then when I reread it slash watched it.

2780
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:00,540
Actually I watched it, I did not read it.

2781
03:02:00,580 --> 03:02:01,460
I don't know why I said read it.

2782
03:02:02,180 --> 03:02:04,360
When I rewatched it, the remake.

2783
03:02:04,360 --> 03:02:08,540
I was like, oh my gosh, I really love Toru with Yuki.

2784
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:12,420
And I know he's not like the guy she's gonna get with.

2785
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:13,980
So that makes me so sad.

2786
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:16,100
And then I kept watching it.

2787
03:02:16,340 --> 03:02:20,000
And for those who don't know, the reason she doesn't get with Yuki.

2788
03:02:20,340 --> 03:02:23,980
Is because suddenly midway through the season or through the series.

2789
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:26,860
He's like, oh, I don't love Toru Honda.

2790
03:02:27,220 --> 03:02:29,040
I love her like she's my mom.

2791
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:32,580
She got mom zoned.

2792
03:02:32,580 --> 03:02:35,140
And that makes me so sad.

2793
03:02:39,460 --> 03:02:41,500
I've never seen that happen before.

2794
03:02:41,860 --> 03:02:43,280
Especially in like a shoujo.

2795
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:45,140
To get mom zoned.

2796
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:47,180
Makes me sad.

2797
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:52,840
I was like, because I was always just like, oh, I wonder, you know, what happens with Yuki.

2798
03:02:53,720 --> 03:02:55,540
Like, I really like him.

2799
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:57,040
He's so polite.

2800
03:02:57,540 --> 03:02:58,780
And he's so cute.

2801
03:02:58,780 --> 03:03:00,420
And then...

2802
03:03:01,100 --> 03:03:03,780
And I was just like, oh, he's so good for Toru.

2803
03:03:05,980 --> 03:03:07,700
And then he mom zoned her.

2804
03:03:07,820 --> 03:03:10,460
And it's funny because she acts like a mom to Kyo.

2805
03:03:10,660 --> 03:03:12,780
So I'm just like...

2806
03:03:16,200 --> 03:03:17,720
It's honestly so funny.

2807
03:03:18,940 --> 03:03:21,260
Maple, that was my ship.

2808
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:24,080
That's my ship and you say it's funny.

2809
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:26,920
That was my ship.

2810
03:03:30,900 --> 03:03:33,180
Is my ship a joke to you?

2811
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:40,180
Like Char and Char's counterattack.

2812
03:03:40,260 --> 03:03:40,740
Oh wait.

2813
03:03:42,100 --> 03:03:43,300
I have to watch Gundam.

2814
03:03:45,220 --> 03:03:46,560
Ships are serious business.

2815
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:49,500
The ship sailed into the sunset.

2816
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:51,600
And no, it didn't sail.

2817
03:03:52,180 --> 03:03:54,040
It actually, it docked.

2818
03:03:54,440 --> 03:03:55,440
It didn't sink.

2819
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:56,480
My ship did not sink.

2820
03:03:56,500 --> 03:03:56,980
It docked.

2821
03:03:56,980 --> 03:03:59,340
At like a...

2822
03:03:59,980 --> 03:04:01,520
At like a port.

2823
03:04:13,730 --> 03:04:16,440
I love ending a bloodline.

2824
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:22,800
This is a lot of fun.

2825
03:04:23,500 --> 03:04:24,680
So four missions left.

2826
03:04:25,260 --> 03:04:27,280
We'll be able to do it next week.

2827
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:30,240
Yes, yes, yes.

2828
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:32,620
I'm going to go eat dinner.

2829
03:04:34,140 --> 03:04:39,420
Thank you guys for joining me for more Devil May Cry.

2830
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:41,820
And next week we'll beat it.

2831
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:43,680
And then the week after...

2832
03:04:44,320 --> 03:04:45,760
No, not the week after.

2833
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:47,940
I might give a little bit of time between...

2834
03:04:49,240 --> 03:04:50,440
Between starting five.

2835
03:04:50,860 --> 03:04:51,880
But it will happen obviously.

2836
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,320
I think you'd like Gundam as an MGS fan.

2837
03:04:55,640 --> 03:04:57,500
Source, I am an MGS fan who loves Gundam.

2838
03:04:57,740 --> 03:04:58,440
I want to!

2839
03:04:58,620 --> 03:05:00,680
I want to get into Gundam.

2840
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:02,160
What would you start with?

2841
03:05:02,260 --> 03:05:03,280
What should I start with?

2842
03:05:03,580 --> 03:05:04,180
Thanks for the one stream.

2843
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:04,620
Thank you!

2844
03:05:05,420 --> 03:05:07,620
The ship docked at the mother base.

2845
03:05:09,720 --> 03:05:10,600
Watch Gundam.

2846
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:13,100
Minto is pure, pure freak.

2847
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:16,580
Oedipus!

2848
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:19,320
Hey Minto, I see you as a mother figure.

2849
03:05:20,980 --> 03:05:21,540
No!

2850
03:05:25,360 --> 03:05:26,480
The original Gundam?

2851
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:27,140
Start at the beginning.

2852
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:30,720
OG Gundam.

2853
03:05:30,820 --> 03:05:31,540
Start with 00.

2854
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:32,760
Is that OG?

2855
03:05:33,480 --> 03:05:34,540
Is that the beginning, beginning?

2856
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:45,560
I want to watch the original too because of the new series.

2857
03:05:45,980 --> 03:05:47,400
The Geckos.

2858
03:05:47,700 --> 03:05:48,620
What's it called?

2859
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:50,900
Watch Gundam in release order if real.

2860
03:05:51,100 --> 03:05:51,320
OK.

2861
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:52,120
OK.

2862
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:53,020
OK.

2863
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:56,200
Thanks for the one stream.

2864
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:56,700
Thank you!

2865
03:06:07,580 --> 03:06:09,040
The Gundam dock.

2866
03:06:11,900 --> 03:06:13,800
Yes, the Suisei one.

2867
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:20,960
I see you as a father-brother figure that tries to kill me.

2868
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:22,000
Let's go!

2869
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:25,540
Anyway, thank you so much you guys!

2870
03:06:25,660 --> 03:06:26,560
I'm starting to get really hungry.

2871
03:06:26,900 --> 03:06:27,640
So I'm going to go eat.

2872
03:06:28,080 --> 03:06:30,500
And yeah, I will see you when I see you next.

2873
03:06:30,600 --> 03:06:31,740
Tomorrow I'm doing karaoke.

2874
03:06:32,680 --> 03:06:37,880
So if you want to watch some karaoke then come hang out.

2875
03:06:40,780 --> 03:06:41,180
Otsumito!

2876
03:06:41,540 --> 03:06:41,940
Otsumito!

2877
03:06:43,960 --> 03:06:45,920
I'll see you guys later!

2878
03:06:46,460 --> 03:06:46,860
Otsumito!

2879
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:47,880
Bye bye!

2880
03:06:47,960 --> 03:06:48,260
Bye bye!

2881
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:48,780
Bye bye!

2882
03:06:48,780 --> 03:06:49,820
Bye bye!

2883
03:06:50,440 --> 03:06:52,260
Oh, someone eat something delicious.

2884
03:06:52,440 --> 03:06:54,120
Or actually everybody eat something delicious.

2885
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:58,020
And then I'll possess you and I will have a delicious, delicious meal.
