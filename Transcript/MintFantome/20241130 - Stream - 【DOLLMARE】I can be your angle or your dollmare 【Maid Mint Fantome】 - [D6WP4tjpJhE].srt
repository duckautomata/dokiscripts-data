00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,880
Hello, gamers.

2
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,600
Oh my god.

3
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
I just... Sorry.

4
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,860
I just realized...

5
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
So... Oh my gosh.

6
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,420
I was like, why does this sound louder...

7
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,420
Than I'm used to...

8
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,720
In my headphones.

9
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,420
Oh my god.

10
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,180
These are the same headphones that Matara was using for PT yesterday.

11
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,780
And there's a little knob on them that turns the volume up.

12
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,040
And I do that when I'm recording stuff.

13
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,320
So I can hear my voice better.

14
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,860
Without having to turn my voice up, up.

15
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,120
So that it's not peaking.

16
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,780
Which means Matara...

17
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,200
Turned the game up.

18
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,880
So that means the game was probably five times louder.

19
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,980
That's why she was so scared.

20
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,420
Oh my god.

21
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,220
No wonder she was so scared.

22
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,080
I literally... Because I was like, wow, my voice sounds really loud right now.

23
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,060
Because I have monitoring on so I can hear me talk.

24
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,720
Oh my gosh, sorry.

25
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
I literally... I just... I just...

26
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,760
Just now noticed this.

27
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Oh my gosh.

28
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,720
Oh, sorry, hold on.

29
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,880
The audio is a little loud.

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,560
Too bad.

31
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,440
Try again, Ashes.

32
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Also, happy belated birthday.

33
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,260
Oh man.

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,820
Did you already know about the wife ghost behind the character the whole time?

35
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,360
Yes, yes.

36
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,820
I've watched the things about like PT.

37
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,480
So I did know that.

38
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,900
That's why sometimes I'd be like, well, technically she's always there.

39
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,720
But yeah, yeah.

40
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,360
Anyway.

41
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,280
Yes.

42
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,320
Welcome to Dalmer.

43
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,720
The way that this game was described was like...

44
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,220
Kind of papers, please.

45
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,220
Oh, wait, you switched it.

46
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,040
You switched it, Ashes.

47
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,640
You got the hot dog this time.

48
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,700
Hot dog.

49
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,480
And like papers, please.

50
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,760
But also observation duty.

51
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,460
I don't know.

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,320
I just found it.

53
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,280
Sorry, I've been on such a horror streak recently.

54
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,980
I have been like non-stop horror games.

55
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,000
But I'm a ghost and I'm kind of always in the horror mood.

56
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,380
So I apologize.

57
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,300
Pampers, please.

58
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,580
That's so good.

59
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,300
That's so good.

60
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,640
Tis the season.

61
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,860
I do want to do for anyone curious.

62
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,700
Anybody who's been like, Mito, you should play Merry Gear Solid.

63
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,240
I do want to play that.

64
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,120
The Merry Gear Solid.

65
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,640
So I have that on the schedule for, I think, next week?

66
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,500
Week after?

67
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,780
Next week.

68
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,920
Next week.

69
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,460
Mito, but I'm scared.

70
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,900
Don't be scared.

71
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,940
We're all here.

72
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,760
I'm here with you.

73
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,520
And I'm a ghost.

74
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,750
And then, that's why I'm also like...

75
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,910
I, you know, used to be someone that would watch a lot of Let's Plays of horror games.

76
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,670
I could always... I would never play them myself.

77
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,290
I would always be like, I'm too scared.

78
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,190
So now I've become... I feel like I've become so much more brave.

79
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,530
Because now I'm the person playing the horror games.

80
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,410
And then other people are like, I'm too scared.

81
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,310
I can't play it.

82
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,650
So now it's me.

83
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,050
I took that role.

84
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,690
Wow, Crasher!

85
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,310
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

86
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,910
Thank you!

87
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

88
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,550
Thank you so much!

89
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,490
The music in this though...

90
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,230
Oh my gosh, I have another Mitara story.

91
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,290
She left back home today.

92
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,850
This morning.

93
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,350
But I...

94
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,090
So last night, when we were...

95
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,470
When we were streaming...

96
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,410
We got some twin snake gummies.

97
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,350
You know, like the ones that are half...

98
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,970
Half sour, half sweet.

99
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:43,650
Right?

100
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,070
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,710
I saw there was a second one too.

102
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,890
Yeah, I want to do them both.

103
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,010
Dr .Glorious, thank you for the 10 gifted.

104
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,790
And ViviCore, thanks for the 5 gifted.

105
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,870
Thank you guys!

106
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,770
Zephyx, welcome back!

107
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,150
Thank you.

108
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,430
Mervy, thanks for the 5 gifted.

109
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,370
Those sound great right now.

110
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,110
They're my favorite gummies ever.

111
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,750
They're so delicious.

112
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,990
If you've never had...

113
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,730
If you've never had twin snakes.

114
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,390
But I bought...

115
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,470
I bought a bag and she bought a bag.

116
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:12,770
Right?

117
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,530
So...

118
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,790
I had my own bag.

119
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,410
She had her own bag.

120
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,330
Last night...

121
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,570
She left the room for a second.

122
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,390
And came back with a bag of twin snakes.

123
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,470
And I was like...

124
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,810
Are those my twin snakes?

125
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,350
She was like, yeah.

126
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,610
I went and I stole your bag because I ate all of mine.

127
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,770
What?!

128
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,870
Those are my twin snakes!

129
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,950
And so...

130
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,870
She didn't finish the bag last night.

131
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,830
I left it on my desk here.

132
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,150
In my office, right?

133
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,830
I left them on my desk here in my office.

134
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,470
Which is where I stream.

135
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:52,990
And...

136
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,370
Then...

137
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,610
They were not finished.

138
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,350
I go to sleep.

139
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,330
I wake up this morning.

140
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,950
The bag is gone.

141
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,710
The bag is gone.

142
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,930
And it's empty.

143
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,090
And in the trash.

144
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,250
She was not sleeping in this room.

145
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,730
She was sleeping in the guest bedroom.

146
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,850
She came back into here.

147
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,030
She came back into here.

148
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,630
To grab my bag of twin snakes.

149
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,570
And finish my bag.

150
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,670
And finish eating them.

151
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,450
And I even bought her bag.

152
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,510
I bought her bag and my bag.

153
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,890
I bought both of our bags.

154
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,570
And she ate both of them.

155
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,650
I got like three snakes.

156
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,350
Also Zenflex!

157
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,110
Thank you so much for the pin.

158
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,930
Congratulations on the new job!

159
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,190
Let's go!

160
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,050
Thank you.

161
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,230
No!

162
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,430
That should be your celebratory money.

163
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,490
Roach behavior.

164
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,170
Truly!

165
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,370
Truly!

166
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,830
And then I have like a bowl of candy.

167
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,010
She kept eating at that.

168
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,470
And...

169
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,470
She also bought other candies.

170
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,910
At the store.

171
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,030
And she left the wrappers.

172
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,610
She actually cleaned up all the wrappers.

173
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,430
But there were just wrappers everywhere.

174
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,070
Of these little candies.

175
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,670
She is like a fiend.

176
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,910
This is actual roach behavior.

177
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,800
Boyfriend isn't home today?

178
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,820
Does boyfriend not like Vtubers?

179
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,860
Dump him.

180
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,200
We'll go out later in an hour.

181
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,240
High five wherever you go!

182
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,860
Thank you for the super chat.

183
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
Stream title says you can be an angle.

184
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,060
I agree you are an acute angle.

185
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,060
Maybe a little obtuse sometimes.

186
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,820
Are you sure you didn't eat them all in your sleep?

187
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm positive.

188
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,000
Actually I didn't even realize that they were gone.

189
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,700
Like I left them on my desk.

190
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,400
And then I came back into here.

191
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,040
And I was like...

192
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,240
And then I see a trash bag.

193
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,320
And I see both wrappers in there.

194
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,500
And I was like...

195
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,060
And then I was like...

196
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,220
Both bags are in the trash!

197
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,660
And one of them I left on my desk!

198
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,220
So I know she ate it.

199
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,900
Playing Metal Gear for the first time today.

200
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,260
Whoop deers have so much fun.

201
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,580
Minto, it was my birthday yesterday.

202
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,100
I wanted to share some of my birthday money.

203
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,480
No!

204
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,420
Keep your birthday money!

205
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,100
I was too shy to ask for a birthday song yesterday.

206
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,840
I could have gotten one now.

207
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,760
You could have, Noxy!

208
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,320
You could have gotten one with the both of us.

209
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,380
Happy birthday to you!

210
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,380
Happy birthday to you!

211
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,180
Happy birthday dear Noxy!

212
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,440
Happy birthday to you!

213
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,340
Happy birthday!

214
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,240
But yeah, that was an eventful last couple of days.

215
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,640
It's nice and quiet now.

216
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,360
There's so much peace and tranquility in my afterlife now.

217
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,620
It's like I can finally breathe again.

218
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,660
I don't really breathe, but...

219
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,220
It's just like there's less negative energy in my myth cafe.

220
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,100
Thank you, of course!

221
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,900
Thank you!

222
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,160
AI summary says you're the one with the sweet tooth, Minto.

223
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,840
But yeah, but still, I have lots to keep me busy.

224
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,320
Lots of prep still for Phantom Thief concert and some other stuff I've been preparing.

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,420
I know I said something might be happening this week, but I believe it's actually might going to be happening early next week.

226
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,480
I apologize for the delay.

227
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,340
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll have to just see when it all happens.

228
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,040
I didn't know it was Halloween.

229
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,420
Thanks for celebrating my birthday, Minto.

230
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:24,860
Wait!

231
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,160
Like your birthday was Halloween, Cooper?

232
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,900
Something is happening.

233
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,240
Something.

234
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,660
Something, something.

235
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,460
I heard Minto is a great dancer.

236
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,040
I like dancing.

237
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,020
I really do.

238
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,820
I haven't danced so much in a long time.

239
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm a little rusty, so...

240
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,140
I'm nervous.

241
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,600
Finally started Astro Boy.

242
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,400
Oh, it's side play.

243
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,000
Astro's playroom.

244
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,220
I thought about doing playroom.

245
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,440
I've only done the first level.

246
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,380
I'm loving it already.

247
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,220
Thanks for inspiring me to start playing this.

248
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,500
Yeah!

249
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,920
Happy you could play.

250
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,700
So good.

251
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,100
I like dancing.

252
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,380
I just...

253
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,060
I don't know.

254
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,220
Can you guys already believe that it's December tomorrow?

255
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,000
That's crazy.

256
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,360
Sorry if you can hear me sipping on my tea.

257
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,780
That's crazy, right?

258
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,320
Haribo and Konami should do a Twin Snakes collab.

259
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,940
I agree.

260
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,700
This year has been very, very fast.

261
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:42,640
And for the VTuber sphere, I'll say.

262
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,760
For the VTuber world, it has been very, very eventful.

263
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,160
I hope everybody's doing okay.

264
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,460
It's been very, very eventful.

265
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,940
But, you know, I think VTubing is still a lot of fun.

266
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,040
And hopefully you still can enjoy it as a medium, if anything.

267
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,120
You know, kind of like if you're like, I enjoy this band.

268
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
I enjoy VTubing.

269
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,020
It's been wild.

270
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,340
2024 is a very tough year for VTubers.

271
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,180
Yeah.

272
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
But there's also been a lot of really great things that have happened, too.

273
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,420
So, you know.

274
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,640
I think, obviously, it's very easy to focus on the negative.

275
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,680
But there's been a lot of really awesome things that happened this year, too.

276
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,680
I think that, you know, we can...

277
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,580
You know, sad things might happen in 2025 as well.

278
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,860
But I think there will also be a lot of really awesome things that happen in 2025.

279
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,760
And we still have one more month to go.

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,440
And we have more events, even, in that month.

281
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,780
Like, you know, the Phantom Thief concert.

282
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,420
And that same weekend, even, is Hololive concert.

283
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,060
So, and whatever people have planned for Christmas and New Year.

284
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:20,920
Yeah.

285
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,360
Just, you know.

286
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
Go along with the ride.

287
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,280
Have fun with it.

288
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,980
My cat keeps opening my window.

289
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,400
Pa, stop it.

290
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,800
Stop opening.

291
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,460
Hold on.

292
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,460
She likes to watch the birds.

293
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,600
Pa, stop.

294
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,780
Stop it.

295
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,060
Okay, Mint's return is one of those positives.

296
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm happy to be here.

297
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm happy to be considered a positive.

298
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,040
Maybe.

299
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,460
She wants to eat them.

300
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:56,800
I know.

301
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,200
She, like, does that weird, like...

302
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
Have you ever...

303
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,400
For those who don't have birds... Sorry, not birds.

304
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:01,860
Cats.

305
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,400
When a cat sees, like, a bird or, like, a squirrel or something outside...

306
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,440
They do this thing where they go...

307
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,020
Yeah, the chirping noises.

308
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,860
They go...

309
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,480
It's so cute.

310
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
Sometimes she does it.

311
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,980
Butaro doesn't really do it so much.

312
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,480
I think because he's older, he doesn't really care about looking outside.

313
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,200
But she...

314
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,300
Because I think I got her from a shelter...

315
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,320
And all she did ever was, you know, she was inside a cage...

316
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,820
And all she could ever do was look outside.

317
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,920
I think she's obsessed with looking outside.

318
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,220
Back to MGSCon at boss level!

319
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,300
You gotta call me boss for now.

320
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,160
No.

321
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,660
There's only...

322
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,340
There's only room for one boss and one snake.

323
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,880
Got me an artist wife.

324
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,940
She draws lots of cute mint art.

325
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,320
Really?

326
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,680
That's the sound I make when Minto is on screen.

327
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,360
Shut up, Murphy!

328
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,200
She wants to eat those birds.

329
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,540
I know, it's so cute.

330
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,280
It's so cute.

331
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,110
Alright.

332
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,650
You guys ready to play Dollmare?

333
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,950
Again, I don't really know anything about this game.

334
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,090
So let's check it out.

335
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,230
So you can barely see the dolls scattered around.

336
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,670
Okay, like that maybe.

337
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,430
I can barely see them.

338
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,170
The lighting is kind of...

339
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,090
Oh, in this game, every playthrough is slightly different.

340
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,910
Many events in the game are not scripted.

341
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,670
Meaning that what you encounter is unique for...

342
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,610
Only for you!

343
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:46,990
Wow.

344
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,110
Stop it, Paz!

345
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,270
Stop opening my window, please!

346
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,710
I love you.

347
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,850
Let's stop, you're stinky.

348
00:18:59,390 --> 00:18:59,930
God.

349
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,450
She lets in the silence.

350
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,290
Okay.

351
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,210
You will not be chased by a monster.

352
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,510
Nothing will scream or jump in your face.

353
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,670
But it is still a horror game.

354
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,350
Be prepared of being scared.

355
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,770
Are you ready to start working?

356
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,930
Okay, so I guess no...

357
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,690
No jump scares?

358
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,130
That's good to know at least, right?

359
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,270
With rent and bills piling up, I took a part-time job at an old toy factory.

360
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,670
People whisper about its shady reputation, but I don't care.

361
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,070
I just need the money.

362
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,330
Today is my first day.

363
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,110
I could...

364
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,750
I never could have imagined what's waiting for me inside.

365
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,510
Hold space.

366
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,550
Alright.

367
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,130
What if that's a lie?

368
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,670
I know, what if they lead you into like a false sense of...

369
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,310
Like...

370
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,890
False sense of security?

371
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,410
Still really dumb.

372
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,750
Sweet cheeks!

373
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,530
Okay.

374
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,430
Okay.

375
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,310
What the hell was that?

376
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,090
Task, go to locker room and put on your uniform.

377
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,410
Can I run?

378
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,290
I'm so...

379
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,690
I'm so small!

380
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,850
I can barely...

381
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,750
I'm tiny!

382
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,850
Oh my gosh!

383
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,490
Locker room.

384
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,270
What else is here?

385
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,730
Assembly, generator, utility, exit.

386
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,110
Okay.

387
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,310
Hello, gamers!

388
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,110
Oh, nevermind.

389
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,990
Nice, we got water in here.

390
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,750
Does it seem dark to you?

391
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,350
Maybe it's dark because I have my windows open.

392
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,030
Is this my locker?

393
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,390
Alright.

394
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,130
Very good.

395
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,310
I'm sure we're looking right...

396
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,590
Stopper.

397
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,150
Okay.

398
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,750
Workshop, workshop, workshop.

399
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,350
Workshop, workshop, workshop.

400
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,330
Employee of the month.

401
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,990
That's gotta be me.

402
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,630
Is that your POV?

403
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,210
Canonical height?

404
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,170
Blah, blah, blah.

405
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,390
Look at this.

406
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,830
Even the light switches are ginormous.

407
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,810
Maybe we're actually a doll.

408
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,870
Gosh, it's really dark.

409
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,430
Fulfillment.

410
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,170
I will feel very fulfilled.

411
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,590
Repairs.

412
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,410
Gosh, it's really dark.

413
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:30,970
Place.

414
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,270
Oh.

415
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,210
Inspect.

416
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,930
Sweet Cheeks Factory.

417
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,910
OC Department.

418
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,270
Quality control...

419
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,650
Oh, sorry.

420
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,070
QC.

421
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,170
Quality Control Instructions.

422
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,450
Hello, everyone.

423
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,170
Today is my birthday.

424
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,870
I'm glad I get to spend a part of it watching you.

425
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,370
Happy birthday, Gingerbread Man!

426
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,270
Run, run, as fast as you can.

427
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,970
You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.

428
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,010
And today is the Gingerbread Man's...

429
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,250
Wait.

430
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,170
Wait.

431
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,170
Hold on.

432
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,990
Run, run, as fast as you...

433
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,170
Wait.

434
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,590
Wait.

435
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,570
Run as fast as you can.

436
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,610
You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.

437
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,490
And the Gingerbread Man has a special day.

438
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,150
Wait.

439
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,190
Has something to say.

440
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,890
Today is his happy birthday.

441
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,930
Happy birthday!

442
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,430
Gingerbread Man.

443
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,270
Happy birthday!

444
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,950
Gingerbread Man.

445
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,550
Run, run, as fast as you can.

446
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,390
You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.

447
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,210
And the Gingerbread Man has something to say.

448
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,750
It's his happy birthday!

449
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,110
Okay.

450
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,590
I hope you like your special version.

451
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:42,850
Okay.

452
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,170
Pick up a doll from the left conveyor belt.

453
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,090
Oh, conveyor.

454
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,510
Inspect it carefully.

455
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,670
If the doll passes the check, put it on the approval conveyor.

456
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,510
If there is something wrong with the doll, throw it in the disposal chute immediately.

457
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:55,730
Okay.

458
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,450
Keep doors closed.

459
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,770
Oh, oh, okay.

460
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,210
Okay.

461
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,610
I'm glad I saw that.

462
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,170
Why do they want that there though?

463
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,890
This door is closed.

464
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,410
Gosh, I can barely see it!

465
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,290
Guys, I'm gonna turn up the brightness a little bit more.

466
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,050
Nevermind.

467
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,470
Oh, here.

468
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,870
Even still!

469
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,610
Does that even do anything?

470
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,430
Epic settings.

471
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,050
Okay, so this is the disposal.

472
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,150
Okay.

473
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,150
Oh my god!

474
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,080
No,

475
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,200
I'm a good worker.

476
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,500
Perform quality checks.

477
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:01,960
Here we go.

478
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,860
Look carefully.

479
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,300
All body parts present.

480
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,740
All fingers present.

481
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,900
No dents.

482
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,300
They don't...

483
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,200
They are not a gamer.

484
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,600
Alright.

485
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,500
How many fingers are they supposed to have?

486
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:18,860
Five?

487
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,620
We're inspecting.

488
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,240
Five fingers.

489
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,640
Five toes.

490
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,420
This guy looks...

491
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,020
He's got a little bit of a bald spot.

492
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,840
Is that a defect?

493
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,380
Did the eyes move?

494
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,880
Oh, I can't tell.

495
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,600
No.

496
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,370
Looks fine to me.

497
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,940
There he goes.

498
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,300
Yay!

499
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,350
Missing an arm.

500
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,770
Defective!

501
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,810
Defective!

502
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,530
Sayonara.

503
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
This is incredibly inefficient.

504
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,300
Oh my god.

505
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,620
Little grandpa doll.

506
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,780
Five.

507
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,400
One, two, three, four, five.

508
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,320
One, two, three, four, five.

509
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,260
He's got his toes.

510
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:22,900
Yeah.

511
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,980
He looks like a little grandpa for real.

512
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,640
Is that supposed to be there?

513
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,180
The tail?

514
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,700
Yeah.

515
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,980
Good job guys.

516
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,720
Yes, Columbo?

517
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,400
I'm not... I'm not...

518
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,830
Okay.

519
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:52,770
Yeah.

520
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,010
I am.

521
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,370
Thank you, sir.

522
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,390
I'm not defective.

523
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,630
I'm scared of winning this game.

524
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,510
It says that there's no, like, nothing that jumps out, but like...

525
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,330
I'm scared.

526
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,990
This game has, like, such an atmosphere.

527
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,370
Five, five, five, five.

528
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,190
No tears.

529
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,050
No rips.

530
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,890
No head bumps.

531
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,450
No head dents, I guess.

532
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,170
A sweet little baby.

533
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,490
Wait, the hair?

534
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,370
Big dumpy check.

535
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,370
Does that count as a dent?

536
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,150
Because god damn!

537
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,490
That's a dent, baby!

538
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,510
I think it's a good dent.

539
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,510
Alright.

540
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,890
What's laughing at me?

541
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,030
Is it her?

542
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,030
Are you laughing at me?

543
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,090
Oh my god!

544
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,800
It gave me chills.

545
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't know.

546
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,120
They're clowning on me.

547
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,160
Oh boy.

548
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh god, that scared me, Roden.

549
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,280
I can't beat MGSV because of the cursed parasites.

550
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,840
You did.

551
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,280
You'll get it.

552
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,600
You'll get it.

553
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,700
Alright, let's...

554
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,640
Four fingers, I mean five fingers, five fingers.

555
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,420
Five toes.

556
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,580
Hair...

557
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,640
It's missing a little bit of hair at the top, but...

558
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,100
Nothing like a good brush can't fix, you know?

559
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,520
Bald.

560
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,720
Bald.

561
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,480
Slightly bald.

562
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,200
I don't think that's a defect, is it?

563
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,900
I think it's just how...

564
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,060
Maybe, I can't tell.

565
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,220
Is that the hairline?

566
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,840
I can't tell.

567
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,460
I think it's normal.

568
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,780
I wish they would give us more light in this room.

569
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,680
Okay.

570
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,020
Alright, little baby.

571
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,080
Defective.

572
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,520
He had a tear.

573
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,210
Don't like that.

574
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,250
Oh, he speaks.

575
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,630
He's got a dent.

576
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,410
Looks fine to me.

577
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,970
I don't think he'd appreciate it if I threw him out, you know?

578
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,310
This is just one of those, like...

579
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,290
Somebody was taking their anger out on the baby, you know?

580
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,490
But I don't want to get in trouble, so...

581
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,570
Oh no!

582
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,690
Another one!

583
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,650
Defective.

584
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,840
What's that rumbling?

585
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,720
Oh!

586
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,500
Oh, sorry.

587
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
I think I made the baby mad at me.

588
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,920
Yeah, it was one of Sid's from Toy Story's experiment.

589
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,760
That was just like a little demon baby.

590
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,440
Did I hear another one?

591
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,390
Nothing rumbling at me, okay.

592
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,770
Oh, okay, that's a light.

593
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,590
Gosh, I'm getting a little...

594
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,430
I'm getting a little paranoid, you guys.

595
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,810
I'm getting a little paranoid!

596
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,430
I'm scared!

597
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,750
What about this guy?

598
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:16,830
Stop.

599
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,350
You're under arrest for having the fattest dumpy in the west.

600
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,610
Gosh, how are you supposed to chop down any trees with that?

601
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,930
He's catching the logs in between there.

602
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,050
It's just so crazy.

603
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,270
Oh yeah, his fingers.

604
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,410
He's got enough fingers.

605
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,670
He's got enough toes.

606
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,290
His hair is good.

607
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,450
This is a perfectly normal baby child.

608
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,210
Dog.

609
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,270
Lumbergat.

610
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,710
This is our entirely unique...

611
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,710
Keep that close.

612
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,170
We're keeping all doors closed here.

613
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,870
I can't see over there.

614
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,050
It's so dark, I can't see!

615
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,590
Oh gosh, okay.

616
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,540
Kid looks fine.

617
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,280
Four fingers.

618
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,800
I mean, sorry, I keep counting the ones excluding the thumb, which is why I say...

619
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,780
Yeah, he's got crazy purple eyes.

620
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,200
This guy looks like he could be a VTuber.

621
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,000
Four fingers is not five.

622
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,520
But he has five fingers.

623
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,500
He has four fingers and one thumb.

624
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,120
Four fingers plus a thumb.

625
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,160
Oh my god!

626
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:39,920
Stop!

627
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,160
That scared me!

628
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Boo!

629
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,900
Screw you, ducky!

630
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,360
Make ten correct sorts.

631
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,120
That's what the achievement I just got was.

632
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,660
Oh!

633
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,270
I think this doll...

634
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
has some...

635
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,700
sclera lenses in.

636
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,480
It's just cosplaying.

637
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,880
Obviously.

638
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,460
It's streaming.

639
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,860
I thought I smelled something.

640
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,480
What do you mean?

641
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,240
What do you mean by that?

642
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,780
Guys, we're killing it.

643
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,200
And by it, I mean little dolls.

644
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,880
We're killing defective dolls.

645
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,120
Does he have anything he wants to say?

646
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,520
What do you think he...

647
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,200
What do you think he wants to say?

648
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm just going to keep throwing them away.

649
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,160
Just finished the...

650
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,480
Just finished TFAP.

651
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,660
Got the birthday cutscene.

652
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,800
Wait, does that mean it's your birthday?

653
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,620
Happy birthday!

654
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,420
Thank you, mundane.

655
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,110
Who you calling pinhead?

656
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,550
Oh yeah.

657
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,390
Five.

658
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,330
Five.

659
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,970
Looks normal to me.

660
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,450
See ya, normal.

661
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,130
Nice.

662
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,670
Alright, alright.

663
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,010
What is this curse game?

664
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,890
I know, right?

665
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,730
And it's interesting.

666
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,510
I'm like, none of it's scripted, so...

667
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,310
God, this bald spot is egregious.

668
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,010
We are the worst at... Look at this!

669
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,090
That's crazy!

670
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,690
I would... If I were a kid, I'd be pulling that out.

671
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:14,690
That would be fully... I would see that and be like, I gotta pull the rest out.

672
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,510
And it would become fully bald.

673
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,790
Give me my next baby.

674
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,130
No,

675
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,810
I don't like that.

676
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,350
Generator.

677
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,930
Oh, there's a baby doll!

678
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,590
Oh no.

679
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,910
Do a flip!

680
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,190
Is that...

681
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,810
This is just...

682
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,170
It's just oil.

683
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,730
It's a well-oiled machine, so there's just, you know, oil all around.

684
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,090
Someone's crying in there.

685
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,070
And there was a hand.

686
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,970
I thought it was a hand.

687
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,570
Or rather, when I first saw it, I thought it was a hand, and then I was like...

688
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,510
Oh, I don't think it's a hand.

689
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,090
I think it's...

690
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,270
I hear little footsteps.

691
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,350
This is so scary.

692
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,470
I hear it laughing.

693
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,450
I thought it was part of piping or something, but it was a hand.

694
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,370
Little pitter-patter.

695
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:30,450
Pitter-patter.

696
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,110
Okay, close the door.

697
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,670
Because I say close...

698
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,450
I'm doing it!

699
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,190
Okay.

700
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,350
What am I hearing?

701
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,150
Oh, the door is locked.

702
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,430
Interesting.

703
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,850
I got an achievement for completing a day with no errors.

704
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,750
Uh-oh.

705
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,650
Guys, I left this door open.

706
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,270
Oh no.

707
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,590
Wait, what about...

708
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,150
But I can keep playing.

709
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,830
Or, well, I say playing.

710
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,790
Working?

711
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,470
Does this count for overtime?

712
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,680
Where do I...when do I stop?

713
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,080
Oh, burning that midnight oil.

714
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,800
Do I go home?

715
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,170
He's not stopping me.

716
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,470
Hold on, let's see.

717
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,130
Is there actually like a...do I leave?

718
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,910
It says exit.

719
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,430
I'll go home.

720
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,830
Oh, I left all this stuff open.

721
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,610
I thought I heard something.

722
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,910
I go home in my uniform.

723
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,410
I'm really committed to the bit.

724
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,350
I wish there was a run, but there's not.

725
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,470
Sayonara, babies!

726
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,270
Okay.

727
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,830
Complete day one.

728
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:29,850
Oh, 300!

729
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,290
$320 in one day.

730
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,290
Wait, what is this?

731
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,070
Gift shop?

732
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,370
What's the motivator?

733
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,290
Wait, I want the jack-o'-lantern.

734
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,670
Let's get motivator.

735
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,450
And then we'll get the jack-o'-lantern tomorrow.

736
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
I just finished my first day at the factory.

737
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,520
There's something strange about this place.

738
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,380
Though I can't quite put my finger on it.

739
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,460
At least I got paid.

740
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,160
I keep telling myself tomorrow will be better, but deep down...

741
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,620
I'm not so sure anymore.

742
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,600
Yeah, easy, right?

743
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,880
Not like I'm impressed or anything.

744
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,650
Hello to you too.

745
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,590
Okay.

746
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,170
I'm on my way.

747
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,850
Wait, where's the... Oh, down here.

748
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,570
Oh, this is now utility and locker room.

749
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,010
Oh, don't like that.

750
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,010
Close the door.

751
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,310
Okay, close that.

752
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,290
What happens... Can you die in this game, I wonder?

753
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,730
Like if you don't close the doors, right?

754
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,050
Or will I die because I closed the door?

755
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,310
Oh my god.

756
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,450
What if I open it?

757
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,730
Oh, I had to.

758
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,770
I got a bucket.

759
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,750
Any baby leftovers, please leave.

760
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:24,650
Thank you.

761
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,570
Alright.

762
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,250
I think we're... I think we're good.

763
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,650
This place is absolutely cursed.

764
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,370
I would know.

765
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,790
Why is there already spooky music?

766
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,450
What is fulfillment anyway?

767
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,650
Also, it said I noticed...

768
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:52,170
I don't know if you guys saw, but it said that there was secret notes and I got none of them.

769
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:01,070
Put doll in a box, attach the order slip, send the... Oh no, I hate that.

770
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,630
Wait, I'm gonna be doing more work?

771
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,090
Okay.

772
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,090
Oh, I heard a drip.

773
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,310
And this door is still locked.

774
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:14,610
Okay.

775
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,870
Welcome to Amazon.

776
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,270
The big old workplace.

777
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,510
I wonder if we can find the secret notes now then.

778
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,510
You know, like...

779
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,990
Door is locked.

780
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,930
No repairs.

781
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,470
Okay.

782
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,440
This is gonna drive me insane.

783
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,500
I have improved the dolls.

784
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,260
Okay.

785
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,840
Wait, what is this?

786
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,400
Open box.

787
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,180
This is my motivation.

788
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,060
Success comes to those who don't ask for a break.

789
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,760
Tilt the doll, then bring it back to an upright position to activate the voice function.

790
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,340
Make sure the doll does not say anything inappropriate.

791
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
It's like those... What was it?

792
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,820
The Wicked dolls?

793
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,660
The Wicked Barbie dolls that had Wicked.com or whatever, but it actually...

794
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,480
No movement!

795
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,620
But it actually went to the naughty website.

796
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,320
Alright, our first little doll.

797
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,820
What are you gonna say to us?

798
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,420
I love you.

799
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,860
I love you.

800
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,940
I love you.

801
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,220
Memorable Med!

802
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,420
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gifted!

803
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,640
Thank you, thank you!

804
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,620
Oh my god.

805
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,840
I feel like the guy we see in the lights is just a cardboard cutout.

806
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,660
Probably.

807
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,100
This looks good.

808
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,990
Oh, pajama baby.

809
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,370
Okay.

810
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,210
We got you a little onesie.

811
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:22,590
Oh yeah.

812
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,010
What?

813
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,900
I want to scream.

814
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:31,780
I

815
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,000
want to scream.

816
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,500
Sorry.

817
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,840
You can scream on your way down to garbage.

818
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,960
I'm gonna turn up the game a little bit just for you guys.

819
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,700
Nice.

820
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,620
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want to scream.

821
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,420
Remix of the year?

822
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That was very nice.

823
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,020
What does that mean?

824
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
I want ice cream.

825
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:28,660
I don't know if that's like an inappropriate thing for a doll to say, but it's not a...

826
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,320
It's rather, it's not an appropriate thing, but it's not inappropriate.

827
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,920
You know, like, it's kinda just weird to say.

828
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,080
I think it's fine.

829
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,360
Oh my god.

830
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,450
Okay.

831
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,970
Okay.

832
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,690
Yellow eyes.

833
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,030
Lumberjack clothes.

834
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:15,450
Okay.

835
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:15,530
Okay.

836
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,410
First, first one.

837
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:24,890
Yellow eyes.

838
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,170
Lumberjack clothes.

839
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,770
That was very nice.

840
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,290
Okay, what do I do with him?

841
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,070
What do I, what do I do with him?

842
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,890
Do I just place him?

843
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:42,570
Look at the pillar.

844
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,860
Put the doll in a box.

845
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
Like one of these?

846
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,900
Oh god, it's so dark.

847
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,260
And there's like secret notes around here, but I don't know how to find them.

848
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,500
I mean, that's why they're secret, but...

849
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,420
Oh, in utility.

850
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:15,570
Okay, okay.

851
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,490
In utility.

852
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,890
Do not, under any circumstances...

853
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,050
Do not...

854
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,910
Do not...

855
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,550
The dolls...

856
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,490
Under any circumstances...

857
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,050
In the AmiAmi box, yeah, exactly.

858
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:30,710
Wait!

859
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,070
It changed!

860
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,230
To utility.

861
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,250
Hello, locker room.

862
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,450
I'll be seeing you later.

863
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,790
Okay, a box?

864
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:51,870
A box, a box?

865
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,010
Oh!

866
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:56,910
I got a note.

867
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:58,930
Why am I sorting dolls?

868
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,550
The director always knows when I've sorted them wrong.

869
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,770
Down to the slightest defect.

870
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,070
What's the point of me being here?

871
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,550
True though.

872
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,990
I found a thing, nice.

873
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,070
Oh, so thanks for the shoutout for Ace Combat 7.

874
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,370
You have the DLC missions, yeah.

875
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,270
Yeah, I got them, I got them too.

876
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:24,530
Yeah.

877
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,190
Do not.

878
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,450
I was actually so surprised at how much traction that...

879
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,030
That tweet got, honestly.

880
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,450
Because I was like...

881
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,910
Like, I tweeted about Ace Combat 7 being on sale.

882
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,330
Which is like a really good sale too.

883
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,450
But I was just so shocked at how many people were like...

884
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,730
Responded to it even.

885
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,250
Do I get the dolls in their fulfillment?

886
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,890
Or here?

887
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,530
Or not dolls, the boxes.

888
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,250
Maybe I just bring the doll to a box.

889
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,530
Maybe I pick them up and put them in one.

890
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,720
Oh gosh, something...

891
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,850
Oh my god, the shadow baby scared me.

892
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,800
Yeah, I don't cast a shadow, it's scary as hell.

893
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,680
What do I do with him?

894
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:24,940
In fulfillment.

895
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,800
Okay, let's just take him with us then.

896
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,500
The shadow baby.

897
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,820
Oh, one of these.

898
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,750
Okay, now place.

899
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,890
Put the doll inside.

900
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,870
Pick up.

901
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,850
Attach order slip.

902
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,470
Sorry, I'm trying to place it down.

903
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:56,890
There we go.

904
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,250
Where do I get the order slip from?

905
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:04,590
Maybe...

906
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,850
It's this piece of paper.

907
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:15,910
Did I just hear music?

908
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:16,750
Or am I crazy?

909
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,520
Printed paper.

910
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,820
Just crazy?

911
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:28,260
Okay.

912
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,340
Wait, both?

913
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,740
Okay, pick up.

914
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,360
Put inside.

915
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,040
Set.

916
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,680
Gosh, that was confusing.

917
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,980
Wait, did you guys hear music or not?

918
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,760
Crazy?

919
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,040
I was crazy, weren't you?

920
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,880
No?

921
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,620
It sounded almost like a...

922
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,880
What's the word?

923
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,240
Sweet cheeks!

924
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,600
Okay, this guy is fine.

925
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,800
Like an ice cream truck.

926
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,070
Alright, this doll is demonic, I can already tell.

927
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,490
Oh my god, also her shirt doesn't fit her.

928
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,650
Okay, I knew it.

929
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,150
I want to scream!

930
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,670
She just had a look in her eyes.

931
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:41,970
I could tell.

932
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:43,950
What about...

933
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,220
No movement.

934
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,700
Guys?

935
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,960
The disposal is gone.

936
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:10,810
Hello?

937
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,090
The trash can is gone.

938
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,810
She keeps staring at me.

939
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:20,690
Can

940
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,600
I go into repairs?

941
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:29,940
No?

942
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,760
She knows what I'm trying to do.

943
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,060
That was very nice.

944
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,140
I'm going to get a bad error though.

945
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,280
Try looking outside the room.

946
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,020
Oh my god.

947
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,200
Messed up!

948
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,380
Oh my gosh, it's back!

949
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,360
This game is wild.

950
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,800
Oh my god.

951
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,840
Sweet cheeks!

952
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,940
Okay, enough fingers.

953
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,700
Enough toes.

954
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,300
Seems fine to me.

955
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,120
That was not very nice.

956
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,020
There is a mod to add Minto?

957
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,480
What was that?

958
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,370
What was that sound?

959
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:31,050
What's happening?

960
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,530
What's going on?

961
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,410
Okay.

962
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,650
Green eyes, denim dress clothes should say hello.

963
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,170
What's going on?

964
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,350
Why was it getting so scary?

965
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:49,530
Ventilation.

966
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,570
Someone in the walls?

967
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,070
Lisa behind you.

968
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,390
What was that?

969
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:01,710
What did she just do?

970
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,570
I say send them all to that doll island in Mexico.

971
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,010
True!

972
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,170
That was not very nice.

973
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:19,250
I think blinking is a feature though, right?

974
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,110
Oh, another cursed doll.

975
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,410
What do you say?

976
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:30,770
You would be perfect if not.

977
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,130
Green eyes.

978
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:35,690
Kaneki-kun.

979
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,510
You would be perfect otherwise.

980
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,770
What if someone wants a demon doll?

981
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,270
We haven't had this one before.

982
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,650
That's like grey eyes.

983
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,030
Denim dress.

984
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,290
I love you.

985
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,550
Me talking to my cat, making sure she... Let me see.

986
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,170
Okay, she's alright.

987
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,370
I love you.

988
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,090
Okay, she seems alright.

989
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,410
Look at her fingers.

990
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,370
Yeah, I know.

991
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,510
I know you do.

992
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:09,410
I think she's good.

993
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,590
I don't want to do that.

994
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,590
What's over here anyway?

995
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,330
It's kind of bright.

996
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,190
Just a random light source.

997
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:31,490
Okay.

998
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,530
I really would prefer not to do that.

999
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,470
Oh, okay.

1000
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:40,710
Alright.

1001
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,650
One man job.

1002
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,070
Seriously.

1003
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,550
Oh my god, we are going back down here again.

1004
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,730
Assembly is which way?

1005
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,650
Oh, we can't close this door.

1006
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,130
Interesting.

1007
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,870
Baby backup!

1008
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,570
Baby overload!

1009
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,190
Oh my god, this is the thumbnail, isn't it?

1010
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,810
Oh lordy lord.

1011
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,590
This is where babies are made.

1012
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,930
This is how babies are made, everybody.

1013
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,790
Let's search for some notes real quick.

1014
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:20,170
Before we... I wish they gave us a flashlight.

1015
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:21,790
Something!

1016
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,310
This is the baby boom.

1017
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,470
Baby got back.

1018
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,090
Look at all of them.

1019
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,590
All these little babies.

1020
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,450
I see no notes.

1021
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,930
I don't like the music in here.

1022
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,350
I just kind of want to leave.

1023
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:41,410
Oh!

1024
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:46,890
Sir?

1025
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,330
Bossman?

1026
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,490
What are you doing in here?

1027
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,330
Mister?

1028
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:53,650
Oh my god.

1029
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:56,370
And he's gone.

1030
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,370
Of course he is.

1031
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,360
Gosh, I have to go... What was that?

1032
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,740
Gosh, I don't like this at all.

1033
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,280
It does say you won't be chased.

1034
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,460
I think that's a note right there.

1035
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,620
So, at least it gives you that kind of, you know...

1036
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,720
What's the word?

1037
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:21,800
Reassurance?

1038
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,760
A few weeks in and I still haven't seen anyone else.

1039
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,940
All I've got is this director's voice from the loudspeakers.

1040
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,440
He's always watching.

1041
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,400
I can feel it.

1042
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,560
Does he ever leave?

1043
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,280
So the notes are actually pretty easy to see.

1044
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,840
Good to know.

1045
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,840
This looks like we are about to get chased though.

1046
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,460
Does it not?

1047
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,760
Ok, just squeeze.

1048
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,460
This looks like a room that you would have to like...

1049
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,840
avoid...

1050
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,500
stuff while running away.

1051
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,140
You know what I mean?

1052
00:55:58,990 --> 00:55:59,390
Hey!

1053
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:00,950
Get back in line!

1054
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,370
Get back in line little baby!

1055
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,190
You are going to mess up the whole assembly line!

1056
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,630
This is why...

1057
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,710
This is why our thing is jammed.

1058
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,690
We have babies dancing on the assembly line.

1059
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,390
Oh no!

1060
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,310
Oh no.

1061
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:22,910
Bit of a baby jam.

1062
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,330
Baby jam.

1063
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:26,290
Baby jam.

1064
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,090
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby jam.

1065
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,210
I want to what?

1066
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,650
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want to scream.

1067
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:33,550
I want ice cream.

1068
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:36,950
Everything good now?

1069
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,290
Oh!

1070
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,370
Oh my gosh.

1071
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,770
It's so creepy.

1072
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,470
No delivery trucks.

1073
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,630
No raw materials.

1074
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,830
How does this place even work?

1075
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,490
I looked for info about this place but found nothing.

1076
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:00,910
Yet the dolls just keep coming.

1077
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,170
I need to sort them.

1078
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:04,970
But also...

1079
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,220
Also...

1080
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,880
Yeah.

1081
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,100
Also, what do you mean you tried to look this place up?

1082
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,400
How did you get the job then?

1083
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,120
Very SCP-esque.

1084
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,680
How does this even work?

1085
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,060
Someone assembles the babies.

1086
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,120
It will probably be my job later.

1087
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,580
I'm going to make their job even more difficult.

1088
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,880
I'm going to hide the babies.

1089
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,200
There we go.

1090
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,180
Scouted by the CEO.

1091
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,060
Truly.

1092
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,200
Oh, we can't even go down here.

1093
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,620
Oh, we can't go up.

1094
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,120
I was going to say, but we can go up.

1095
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,520
No, we can not.

1096
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,560
Close the door.

1097
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,180
Alright, back to the...

1098
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,740
Oh, everything is messed up.

1099
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,640
The flying foolment.

1100
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,260
The orky lemonco.

1101
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,260
Oh my gosh, my mom at her house, she has like those...

1102
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,860
She has candles that...

1103
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,580
They are like individual candles, but they spell out home.

1104
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,600
You know, each one is a letter.

1105
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,040
Every time I go over, I mix it up.

1106
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,620
I think that's just a ghost thing.

1107
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,700
Now we have the ghost babies doing it too.

1108
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,780
It's just a normal old ghost thing.

1109
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,340
Yeah, like me-hole.

1110
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,800
Wait, is this a denim dress?

1111
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,360
Does this count?

1112
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,700
I think this counts.

1113
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,000
Denim dress, green eyes, says hello, right?

1114
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,800
$300 plus a day for like 30 minutes of work, no ghost or demon would stop me.

1115
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,280
I even start punching.

1116
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,100
I think that's so fair.

1117
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,220
Alright, let's go.

1118
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,520
Do fulfillment.

1119
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,240
How are the fingers?

1120
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,820
Oh, true.

1121
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:14,600
Thank you.

1122
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,840
5, 5, 5.

1123
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,800
Perfect.

1124
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,340
Oh, things are okay again.

1125
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,060
I like that this feels so random.

1126
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:39,640
Like it is random and it feels like, you know, it's fun.

1127
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,820
Okay, let me go get the paper.

1128
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,500
Oh, I hate that I have to open and close the doors though.

1129
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,860
It really freaks me out.

1130
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,320
I feel like I'm gonna open the door at some point and there's gonna be something crazy.

1131
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,250
What's in here?

1132
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,230
No, pick up.

1133
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,830
And send.

1134
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,720
Cool.

1135
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,900
I guess that was correct.

1136
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,360
I can't tell.

1137
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,460
What was that?

1138
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,980
This game is making me paranoid for real.

1139
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,400
Alright, next baby.

1140
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,580
Can you bring the box with you?

1141
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,620
Oh god!

1142
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,240
Holy moly.

1143
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,000
Do it again.

1144
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,700
Garbage, garbage, garbage doll.

1145
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,660
Guys, we are gonna make so much money I think of this round.

1146
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,320
What you got?

1147
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,080
I love you.

1148
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, nevermind.

1149
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:08,620
Cursed.

1150
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,120
Cursed doll.

1151
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,700
Oh man.

1152
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:18,750
At least they are getting easier to spot, right?

1153
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,690
Sweet cheeks.

1154
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:26,950
Let's give it a second, see if she makes any sudden movements.

1155
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,490
Sweet cheeks.

1156
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,230
Yeah, I like the blue hair too.

1157
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:33,850
It's fun.

1158
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,130
Seems fine.

1159
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:38,270
Is that Bulma?

1160
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:43,870
Guys, I was so excited to see Goku.

1161
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,890
This guy seriously looks like an old man.

1162
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:51,030
Goku and Luffy and Pikachu.

1163
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,030
In the Macy's Day Parade.

1164
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:55,850
That was very nice.

1165
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,570
It was very nice seeing them.

1166
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,310
Yeah, I liked it a lot.

1167
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,030
First Bulma, now Vegeta.

1168
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:06,030
What, are we gonna get Trunks next?

1169
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,020
Okay, seems fine.

1170
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,100
We still haven't gotten an error.

1171
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,260
Make 30 correct sorts.

1172
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,600
That's what I got.

1173
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,980
Master of the assembly line.

1174
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,800
Okay, I like the twin tails.

1175
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,600
I love you.

1176
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,280
Missing fingers!

1177
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,580
They cut a bit off.

1178
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,580
I kinda wanna see what happens when you get one wrong, but...

1179
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,020
I'm just too good at the game.

1180
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,960
I think.

1181
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,320
Wow, first time we got a...

1182
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,580
First time we got a wrong...

1183
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,060
fingers.

1184
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,120
He seems fine.

1185
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,220
See ya, kid.

1186
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,260
His eyes glue.

1187
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,150
Hey!

1188
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:32,290
Oh my god.

1189
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,270
Oh my god, she wasn't like that before.

1190
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,010
That's crazy!

1191
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:41,130
Wait!

1192
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,990
Are you...me?

1193
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:49,790
If only she had blue eyes, but the silver hair and everything.

1194
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,510
That's kinda wild.

1195
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,810
His bootleg Minto.

1196
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:01,770
Let's see.

1197
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,230
What do you say?

1198
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,050
Seems fine.

1199
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,010
All fingers and toes attached.

1200
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,270
Seems fine.

1201
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,550
How long is this day?

1202
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:23,870
What was that?

1203
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,470
Our bucket!

1204
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:28,610
Rude!

1205
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,830
It is going in, right?

1206
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,690
Gosh.

1207
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,030
Kicking the bucket over here.

1208
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:42,830
These dolls are inconvenient.

1209
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:49,090
Do you think there is like a cult following for Sweet Cheeks dolls?

1210
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:50,130
You know?

1211
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,990
People are like, we love the Sweet Cheeks!

1212
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,530
There is a lot of defective dolls.

1213
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,630
There is a lot of defective dolls though.

1214
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,530
I think they need to...

1215
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,110
OK.

1216
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,230
Thank you sir.

1217
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,430
Oh look!

1218
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,810
It won't let me use it now, but yesterday it let me use it.

1219
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:17,810
I think we should leave the bucket, right?

1220
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,790
The leak did not get solved.

1221
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,350
I'm feeling very...what's the word?

1222
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:31,290
Stanley parable with my bucket.

1223
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,130
Don't come tomorrow.

1224
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,840
I'm getting bullied?

1225
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,120
Sorry.

1226
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,220
Place.

1227
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:56,820
Fine.

1228
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,180
I'll just leave it here on the ground.

1229
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,400
There is even blood in here.

1230
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,460
That's a lot of spray paint.

1231
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,160
The pay though.

1232
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:04,940
I know, right?

1233
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,940
Don't come tomorrow.

1234
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,960
The kid is telling me not to come tomorrow.

1235
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:23,330
Alright.

1236
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,880
I'm gonna leave.

1237
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,980
I sure hope no possessed dolls.

1238
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,100
You know, I really need to eat.

1239
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,620
Complete day 2.

1240
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,640
Keep it rolling.

1241
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,080
Production report.

1242
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,020
Correct sorts.

1243
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,590
3 out of 4.

1244
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:05,570
$800.

1245
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,510
Alright, let's get the jack-o-lantern.

1246
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,810
Let's get the puzzle toy.

1247
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:10,710
The mug.

1248
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:12,890
Okay, that's all we can get.

1249
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,430
We'll just go down the line.

1250
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,290
I made it through another shift.

1251
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:20,270
The dolls seem different today.

1252
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:21,250
Their eyes.

1253
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,530
I swear they followed me as I moved across the factory.

1254
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:28,370
So proud of me for reaching such a high level of adequacy.

1255
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,390
You mean accuracy.

1256
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:34,990
Right?

1257
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:35,430
Accuracy.

1258
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:38,930
Good job Mito.

1259
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,130
Here's a tiny bonus.

1260
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,090
Oh, thank you!

1261
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,810
They follow me as I move across the factory.

1262
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:51,350
I keep telling myself it's all in my head, but this place is getting to me.

1263
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,610
I can feel it.

1264
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,670
I wonder... Sorry.

1265
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:00,830
I wonder how many days there are.

1266
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,150
Hello dolls!

1267
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:07,330
I need to eat, so don't bother me please.

1268
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:12,830
Dolls, I just... What the hell is that?

1269
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,990
Oh, we have a different packaging now?

1270
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:22,650
Alright.

1271
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,470
Anything in this locker?

1272
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,490
Still nothing in here.

1273
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,510
Let's just turn on all the lights while we can.

1274
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,610
Oh, the bucket is back in there.

1275
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:35,310
I think we need to come grab it.

1276
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:35,910
Oh shoot!

1277
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,550
Oh my god, I've been leaving the doors open.

1278
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:38,490
You guys, the doors!

1279
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:39,510
I've been leaving the doors open!

1280
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,910
Five nights at Dollhairs.

1281
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:51,490
Everything fine in here?

1282
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:51,810
OK.

1283
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,350
Alright.

1284
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,630
Let's go see all of our stuff that we bought.

1285
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:00,630
I'm so excited.

1286
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:01,230
Wow!

1287
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,030
Don't throw it on the ground!

1288
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,420
What was that?

1289
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,760
Was that someone laughing?

1290
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:11,260
Notice.

1291
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,220
New employee.

1292
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,240
Employee's name.

1293
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,400
You left the locker open.

1294
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:16,780
Oops.

1295
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,380
What happens if the doors are open?

1296
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,120
I don't know.

1297
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,280
I've got some business to handle elsewhere, so I won't be around the factory today.

1298
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,780
There's a new task for you.

1299
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,220
We've got a bunch of dolls that have missing eyes, hands, legs or heads.

1300
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:32,820
Throwing those into the trash from now on is prohibited.

1301
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,100
You'll find all the info you need in the repair room behind you.

1302
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,290
Don't mess up.

1303
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:38,840
The director.

1304
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:41,540
OK.

1305
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:44,680
Our mug.

1306
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,020
Rubik's cube.

1307
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,760
Jack-o'-lantern!

1308
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,460
Does it turn on?

1309
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:56,780
Or...

1310
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,700
Don't blink too often?

1311
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,820
I'll try.

1312
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:13,590
OK.

1313
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:14,950
Nothing is open.

1314
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:18,630
God, I thought that baby was staring at me.

1315
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:22,370
Don't blink.

1316
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:33,960
Uh...

1317
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,490
Oh, wow.

1318
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,650
It's a whole little baby workshop.

1319
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,590
Oh, my God.

1320
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:45,350
Oh, wow!

1321
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:46,950
Pick up detail.

1322
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,170
Oh, sorry.

1323
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,770
No, no, no.

1324
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:49,070
Please.

1325
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,290
I got another note.

1326
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:54,410
I found something in the archives.

1327
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,930
This factory was famous for making dolls with incredible detail.

1328
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,990
Perfect toys, they said.

1329
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,790
But it was burned to the ground... 20 years ago.

1330
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,970
Wee-woo!

1331
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,250
OK.

1332
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:10,790
I guess we'll just have to try this out once we get a bad baby.

1333
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,090
Spooky!

1334
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:16,630
There's a little bit of lore going on.

1335
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,270
OK!

1336
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:21,610
Of course, it's our first doll that we have to go repair.

1337
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,370
Alright.

1338
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,570
Let's... Gosh, so scary!

1339
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:35,470
But dolls... I'm not... I wouldn't say that doll... Baby dolls really scare me so much.

1340
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:37,630
The Hudson River, 20 years ago.

1341
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,050
You're not going to clean up your peanuts?

1342
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:44,010
What am I supposed to do with my peanuts?

1343
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,730
What's that do?

1344
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:50,030
Oh!

1345
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:52,510
We gave her a whole new hairstyle!

1346
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,490
This is the repair... Maybe I should read first.

1347
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:01,790
If a doll is missing body parts, place it on the holding stand and attach the missing limbs.

1348
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,890
If the doll is missing hair, there's a special tool behind the holding stand.

1349
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,310
Use it to create new hair.

1350
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,130
Do not put your head inside it.

1351
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,250
It is not a hair dryer.

1352
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:13,510
Someone tried once and it didn't end well.

1353
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,610
Get back to work, the director.

1354
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:20,770
This factory may be fake, but the money is 100% real.

1355
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:21,990
Oh yeah, baby!

1356
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:25,650
What color eye did she have?

1357
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,350
Oh no, they're grey.

1358
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:31,350
Ok, grey eye.

1359
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,210
What was that?

1360
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:34,690
Ok, and an arm.

1361
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:39,510
I hope they don't mind the new hairstyle.

1362
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:40,730
Unsuitable part?

1363
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:41,710
What are you talking about?

1364
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,010
Wait, no, no, no.

1365
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:48,650
That's not what I meant.

1366
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:50,750
So it's a left hand?

1367
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:54,650
Oh, repair a doll for the first time.

1368
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:57,090
It's a ninja.

1369
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,680
Stop it.

1370
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,900
Oh wait, we forgot to see what it says.

1371
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:09,980
Ok.

1372
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,160
See ya.

1373
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,840
You're right, it's left.

1374
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,240
You're right.

1375
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,440
You're right.

1376
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,600
You're right.

1377
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,120
Ok, workout baby.

1378
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:24,980
I love you.

1379
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,220
Workout balding.

1380
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,620
I think it's fine.

1381
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,060
Oh wait, it's got all it's fingers and toes.

1382
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:34,800
I think we're ok.

1383
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,220
Now it says just repair if body parts missing.

1384
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,660
They know we're too good for everything else.

1385
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,860
You know what this game actually reminds me of?

1386
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,120
A little bit.

1387
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,080
Is mortuary assistant.

1388
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,060
And that the events are random.

1389
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,340
And it's a very quiet atmosphere.

1390
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,920
You just do your job and freaky things happen.

1391
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,480
Very mortuary assistant to me.

1392
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,340
Hello.

1393
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,280
I think it's fine.

1394
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,260
It didn't do anything while I was holding it.

1395
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:30,800
Help!

1396
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,160
I guess it doesn't say anything.

1397
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:36,800
It's shy.

1398
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,200
I guess it wouldn't say anything because it's got no mouth to scream.

1399
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,980
What kind of head do you want?

1400
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,980
We'll give you whatever you want.

1401
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,960
Here, I'll do the brown eyes since I have that one from earlier.

1402
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,020
Brown eyes and some hair.

1403
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,670
But the speaker is on the back.

1404
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:12,490
That just suits you perfectly.

1405
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:17,730
The comb over special.

1406
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:21,870
He's like, you couldn't birth me with more hair?

1407
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:24,370
Justin Bieber.

1408
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,310
He's even got the Canadian fit.

1409
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:27,930
It's perfect.

1410
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,130
Oh my god!

1411
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:47,670
God, that scared me.

1412
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:52,970
She's got lifeless eyes.

1413
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,850
Blue eyes like a doll's eyes.

1414
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,130
Very scary.

1415
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:57,350
Grandma.

1416
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,090
Alright grandma, let's give you an arm.

1417
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:04,570
I like how...

1418
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,690
I like how I saw it spawn in.

1419
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,890
That was kind of funny.

1420
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,190
So it's this arm then.

1421
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:14,850
Left hand.

1422
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,840
Did you guys hear that?

1423
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,890
Oh my god, that was so...

1424
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,950
Oh, I got goosebumps everywhere.

1425
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:42,590
Oh, I got absolute goosebumps everywhere.

1426
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:44,070
I said the others...

1427
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,250
It was very, very faint.

1428
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:53,210
I said the others... something, something.

1429
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,830
The others... It sounded like the others never left.

1430
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,190
That was...

1431
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:03,970
Get out of there.

1432
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,630
Get out of there.

1433
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,710
That was not very nice.

1434
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:09,830
I did not like that.

1435
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,170
That was freaky.

1436
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,570
That was so freaky.

1437
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,470
That wasn't very nice.

1438
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,510
I didn't like it at all.

1439
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:23,750
I didn't like it at all.

1440
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:27,850
Oh man.

1441
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:34,510
It sounded like... I had to look over my shoulder.

1442
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:37,010
It sounded like it didn't come from the game.

1443
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:38,310
Ok, I think she's good.

1444
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:39,490
Wait, let me see her fingers.

1445
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:41,090
Ok, you're good.

1446
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,390
Urgent?

1447
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,330
Ok.

1448
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:52,990
I heard another giggle.

1449
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,930
Oh, it's the clown baby.

1450
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:04,710
We have received a report about an unusual doll with claims that it moves on its own when unobserved.

1451
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:09,690
If encountered, must be packaged and sent via the fulfillment room.

1452
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:11,930
Immediately.

1453
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,650
With this order slip attached.

1454
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:20,270
Moves when unobserved, weathered appearance, single yellow eye.

1455
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:22,590
Ok.

1456
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:23,310
Urgent.

1457
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:27,110
So it moves when unobserved.

1458
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,710
This is actual SCP.

1459
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:33,550
Peanut baby.

1460
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,330
That was very nice.

1461
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:41,570
So if the clothes are ripped, I guess then...

1462
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:44,410
It looks like a stain on her shirt.

1463
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:49,790
I guess this is fine though.

1464
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:52,670
Is it actual?

1465
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:53,290
Oh, what?

1466
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:53,850
7-3?

1467
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:58,670
It's gonna escape when Mint goes back for the slip.

1468
01:18:58,730 --> 01:18:58,890
No!

1469
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:00,790
I'm gonna bring the box here.

1470
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:03,810
Oh wait, but how would we...

1471
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,710
How would we...

1472
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:06,050
No!

1473
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:07,530
I'll bring the box here.

1474
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,290
I think it's fine.

1475
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:18,300
Grandma!

1476
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,040
This game is getting to me.

1477
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,340
Toes, fingies, all good.

1478
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,180
I love you.

1479
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,560
She's staring at me though.

1480
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:29,820
That's not normal.

1481
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,660
You're not supposed to be looking at me!

1482
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:36,020
You're not supposed to be looking at me!

1483
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,380
What do

1484
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,800
I do?

1485
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,760
Get a box preemptively.

1486
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,220
No, no, I said it was weathered.

1487
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,900
Weathered appearance, single yellow eye.

1488
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,420
Do you think it's okay?

1489
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,040
Okay.

1490
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,540
Good call everybody.

1491
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,540
I love... That one blinks.

1492
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,010
Don't blink so much.

1493
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,450
Don't blink too often.

1494
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:22,750
Dummy.

1495
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:24,790
Stupid doll.

1496
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:27,530
The one from the start of the game.

1497
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:28,710
What one?

1498
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:29,670
What?

1499
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,710
I

1500
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:42,630
love you.

1501
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:44,810
This one seems fine.

1502
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:49,470
Watch it like starts glitching out when I put it on the conveyor belt.

1503
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:54,170
We found it!

1504
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:58,290
It's so sweet.

1505
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,950
It's eyes are really bugging out.

1506
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,110
Hmm...

1507
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,410
Okay.

1508
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:08,790
Moves when unobserved.

1509
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,650
Check if it moves?

1510
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,270
How would I know?

1511
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,290
I'm gonna lose it.

1512
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:21,010
Okay, we got it.

1513
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,510
Oh god.

1514
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:31,110
Okay, come with me freaky, freako, freakazoid baby.

1515
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:34,070
Okay, place you there.

1516
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,610
Oh gosh, place...

1517
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:37,490
The box.

1518
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,970
Oh god, place the box.

1519
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,750
Place the box.

1520
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:44,970
Place you there.

1521
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:46,570
Pick up box.

1522
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:48,090
Place the box.

1523
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:49,690
Place the box.

1524
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,630
Okay, put doll inside.

1525
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:54,890
Pick up.

1526
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,290
Okay, nice.

1527
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:02,210
Why lights be flickering?

1528
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,770
You think it's still in here though, right?

1529
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:11,050
It's still in there, right?

1530
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,990
Because even...

1531
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:14,250
Check if it's in the box.

1532
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:15,190
Okay, hold on.

1533
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,230
Now it's unobserved.

1534
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:26,790
Schrodinger's doll.

1535
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,370
You look inside the box.

1536
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:34,550
Yeah, we are fine.

1537
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:37,210
It's still in there.

1538
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,670
I don't think the game is that cruel.

1539
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,510
Okay, quantum doll.

1540
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,160
If you are reading this, you have been trapped.

1541
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,420
The fulfillment room door is shut and you can't get out, right?

1542
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,780
Don't panic, there is a way out.

1543
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:15,480
Squeeze into the lift shaft and press the dispatch button.

1544
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,640
It took me to another place.

1545
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,360
From where I have found a way back to my workplace.

1546
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,380
I'm leaving this note in the shaft in case you get stuck too.

1547
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,700
I hope you manage to escape and figure out what's going on.

1548
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:27,440
If I haven't already.

1549
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:28,840
The worker before you.

1550
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,320
Wait, in here?

1551
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,940
Get inside!

1552
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,130
Find a way out.

1553
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:58,770
I don't like this.

1554
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:13,630
Oh my gosh!

1555
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:15,330
Look up.

1556
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:21,070
Wow!

1557
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:23,310
I wonder if you can die in this game.

1558
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,450
I can jump just a tiny bit.

1559
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:28,230
I just realized.

1560
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,330
There is this doorway too and then there is this here.

1561
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,390
Oh gosh!

1562
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:41,150
Okay.

1563
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:44,670
Okay.

1564
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:44,770
Okay?

1565
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:48,210
Oh my god.

1566
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:49,390
What?

1567
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:51,090
This is ridiculous.

1568
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:54,590
This place is bigger than I thought.

1569
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:55,910
Why was it built this way?

1570
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,030
Why are there so many boxes?

1571
01:24:57,570 --> 01:24:59,010
Why can't I find an exit?

1572
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,770
Why am I so huge all of a sudden?

1573
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:04,330
Baby door.

1574
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:06,610
Oh, I can go through.

1575
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:09,950
Kei-chan.

1576
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,170
Kei-chan.

1577
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:14,890
Kei-chan led us astray.

1578
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:16,870
What if Kei-chan is an evil doll?

1579
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,790
Do you think I went the right way, guys?

1580
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,470
I think...

1581
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:26,930
Oh, what?

1582
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,570
Wait, this is where I just came from.

1583
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:30,510
Oh my god.

1584
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:31,770
No way.

1585
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:34,230
Oh my god.

1586
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:34,950
What?

1587
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:38,870
This way for sure.

1588
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:42,870
I don't like this.

1589
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:45,390
Oh, it's so dark.

1590
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,780
So that's the door I...

1591
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:02,450
Where did I come from?

1592
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,610
Okay, so we went through there.

1593
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,610
Let's try the one that's blinking.

1594
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:09,670
Maybe not.

1595
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:09,890
Okay.

1596
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,860
Wait, did I go this way before?

1597
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,240
I

1598
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,530
have to go through this one.

1599
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:25,830
No!

1600
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,990
I think... Wait, let's try upstairs again.

1601
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:32,690
These ones?

1602
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,770
We didn't really go through, right?

1603
01:26:36,210 --> 01:26:37,010
Spooky door.

1604
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,630
Wait, this one has a note, so good thing we checked.

1605
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,670
If you're reading this, you're still alive.

1606
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:42,990
Hopefully.

1607
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:44,370
But you might be trapped.

1608
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:47,710
The doors here lead nowhere and the stairs bring you back to where you started.

1609
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:48,530
There's no exit.

1610
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,910
Follow the blinking light if you want to get out.

1611
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:53,310
Just don't let them catch you?

1612
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:55,650
The worker before you.

1613
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:59,610
What do you mean by that?

1614
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:06,810
Don't let what catch me?

1615
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:09,510
Oh, I think that looped around.

1616
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:09,950
Okay.

1617
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:15,430
Okay guys, if I die...

1618
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:20,330
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

1619
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,810
I'm scared.

1620
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,890
The blinking light.

1621
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,590
Blinking light, blinking light.

1622
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,800
Which one is blinking?

1623
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:40,690
I'm scared to drop down.

1624
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:44,610
I'm scared.

1625
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:47,170
PT Redux.

1626
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:49,430
I don't want to redo.

1627
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:52,810
Poor K-chan.

1628
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:57,750
At least K-chan was nice enough to try and help us out.

1629
01:27:58,730 --> 01:27:59,330
Oh, over there.

1630
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,940
Are we going the right way?

1631
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:14,730
Oh gosh.

1632
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,870
I hear something blinking, but I don't know where.

1633
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:18,570
Maybe upstairs?

1634
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:23,390
Yeah.

1635
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,210
Which one?

1636
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:24,790
This one?

1637
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:26,190
Yeah.

1638
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:28,430
Oh my goodness.

1639
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:29,730
Oh, it's different this time.

1640
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:31,090
Oh, we made it!

1641
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:33,250
We made it!

1642
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,790
We made it!

1643
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:40,750
Oh my gosh.

1644
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:42,030
Footsteps.

1645
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:43,130
I hear them all the time.

1646
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,910
Sometimes I see the shadows in the hallway.

1647
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:49,830
But I'm the only one here, except the director and the dolls.

1648
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,530
Is it going to say like sprint to run or whatever?

1649
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:58,270
Shift to sprint?

1650
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:07,920
Oh shoot.

1651
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,120
Oh,

1652
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,880
this game is crazy.

1653
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,460
Now it's like Little Nightmares vibes.

1654
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,340
If I'm ever stuck in a pre-horror game...

1655
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,420
Wait, what about K-chan?

1656
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:35,520
Oh, I thought something was going to like come in.

1657
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,080
We made it to...

1658
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,520
Another... Wow.

1659
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,380
Okay.

1660
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:50,940
Locked?

1661
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,180
Locked?

1662
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,040
I'm scared.

1663
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:55,780
Locked?

1664
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:56,720
Locked?

1665
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,400
It's too quiet you guys.

1666
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,080
Locked?

1667
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:01,220
Locked?

1668
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:03,080
I'm glad I have my cat in my room with me.

1669
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:09,400
I keep looking at her every couple of minutes to regain sanity.

1670
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,760
Oh, we are in the utility.

1671
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:26,930
He did tell me don't come to work tomorrow.

1672
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:30,130
They told me and I didn't listen.

1673
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,230
They told me don't come to work tomorrow.

1674
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:34,030
But I didn't listen.

1675
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:35,230
I'm the fool.

1676
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,160
I heard the voice whispered again.

1677
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,260
You shouldn't be here.

1678
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:46,920
Creepy.

1679
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,160
What was in the locker?

1680
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:50,720
Oh, there was nothing in the locker.

1681
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:54,140
It didn't seem like...

1682
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:55,940
How do I know when the day is over?

1683
01:30:56,140 --> 01:31:00,360
Gosh, I'm so glad I have my mug and my toy and everything.

1684
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,400
Okay, Justin Bieber.

1685
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,340
This seems fine.

1686
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,060
How many more days are there?

1687
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,300
You're not gonna get paid for that unauthorized break.

1688
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,600
Yeah, we just continue on.

1689
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,800
The hustle never ends.

1690
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,420
Oh, I think.

1691
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,320
Oh my gosh, so cute though.

1692
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,320
But that's definitely like...

1693
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,360
Sweet cheeks.

1694
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,880
That's like something wrong with your head.

1695
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,200
I think that counts as a dent.

1696
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,580
Oh my gosh.

1697
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,580
I think that's the first dent that we've seen.

1698
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:54,740
Something is breathing.

1699
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,720
Do you guys hear it?

1700
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:05,130
Anyway...

1701
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:12,980
Wait, maybe...

1702
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,600
Maybe I can't fix it.

1703
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,760
Maybe I can't fix her.

1704
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,840
I think because... Oh gosh, I don't like the lights.

1705
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,340
I don't think I can fix her because it's a dent.

1706
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,680
I think we have to throw her away.

1707
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:39,510
Okay, so only missing parts we can fix.

1708
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:41,190
Everything else we can't fix.

1709
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:43,490
Alright, what do you have to say?

1710
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:45,050
You look mighty possessed.

1711
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:49,350
Is the door closed?

1712
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,790
Yeah, I closed it.

1713
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:55,350
That doesn't stop the dolls from opening it though.

1714
01:32:55,890 --> 01:33:03,230
Maybe I didn't close the door.

1715
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:07,610
Oh my god.

1716
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:12,270
Freaky.

1717
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:13,790
Was that me?

1718
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,010
Did I do that?

1719
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:18,070
I thought you meant that door.

1720
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:26,910
A knife is a safe and fun toy.

1721
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:38,870
A knife is

1722
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,580
a safe and fun toy.

1723
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,880
That's my favorite remix.

1724
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,880
A knife, a knife, a knife, a knife, a knife, a knife.

1725
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:52,960
What was that?

1726
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:55,960
It was like a high pitch.

1727
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:57,680
Alright, Granny.

1728
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:01,020
I love you.

1729
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:05,000
You got all your toes, you got all your feet, you got all your arms.

1730
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,240
I love you.

1731
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,960
You're not making any sudden movements?

1732
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,200
A knife, a knife, a knife, a knife, a knife, a knife.

1733
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,120
We are so good at this game.

1734
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,980
To the repair!

1735
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:30,570
I wanted to make sure there was no...

1736
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:31,510
What's the word?

1737
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:34,830
Any issues with the...

1738
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:39,190
With the... Let's give him blue eyes.

1739
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:39,810
Blue.

1740
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:42,190
No issues with the clothes.

1741
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,410
And the hairstyle.

1742
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:46,990
Why can't the baby be bald?

1743
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,250
I wonder.

1744
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:52,290
Why can't the baby be bald?

1745
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:56,650
Wouldn't someone want a maybe bald baby?

1746
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,330
Check the voice.

1747
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:10,770
What would you say if held upside down and shaken?

1748
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,620
I'll have another.

1749
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:30,540
The ominous lighting when they go.

1750
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:33,400
No, no, no.

1751
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,820
No, no, no.

1752
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,720
Oh my god, I didn't release Samara!

1753
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:47,820
Oh my gosh, I was about to say wait seven days and she actually came out!

1754
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,040
That's so cute.

1755
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:51,700
Sadako!

1756
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:54,220
Hello.

1757
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:55,980
I think she's good.

1758
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,160
She's got all her fingers and all her toes.

1759
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:04,520
No, I tried to grab her.

1760
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,160
It wouldn't let me.

1761
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,380
How do we know when the day ends?

1762
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:08,860
You think we can just leave?

1763
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:10,360
Oh my gosh.

1764
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:19,030
You think we can just leave whenever we want to?

1765
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,330
Infinite money glitch.

1766
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:25,210
Truly.

1767
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:27,730
We don't have a supervisor.

1768
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:29,110
What if I tried?

1769
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:33,030
Oh gosh.

1770
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:33,770
Stop it.

1771
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:36,770
Stop it, you stinking... OK, so it's the right leg.

1772
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,250
What's that clack?

1773
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:42,950
Is that you?

1774
01:36:43,150 --> 01:36:43,330
Oh.

1775
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,750
Chill out!

1776
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,110
Chill out!

1777
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:49,790
Please!

1778
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:52,270
Unsuitable.

1779
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:52,890
Nevermind.

1780
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:54,010
I was wrong.

1781
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:54,850
Please.

1782
01:36:56,590 --> 01:36:57,950
Oh, that's the hand.

1783
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:58,870
That's why.

1784
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,650
I'm stupid.

1785
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,670
There we go.

1786
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:07,730
I grabbed an arm.

1787
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,330
That was very nice.

1788
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:16,910
Having your arms ripped off was very nice.

1789
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:17,950
Grandpa?

1790
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:20,350
Because these kids look like...

1791
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:25,170
These babies are like... They have that real baby adult...

1792
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:29,290
Like, you know, how some babies really look like grandpas.

1793
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:34,430
Some of these children really have that syndrome.

1794
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:35,770
Middle aged man.

1795
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:39,550
Alright, you got all your fingers, all your toes.

1796
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:40,070
What did he say?

1797
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:40,930
Hello!

1798
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:49,870
She seems fine.

1799
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:52,650
She's not moving at all.

1800
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:56,610
One is going to say, I want another beer.

1801
01:37:56,830 --> 01:38:00,910
Have you guys seen those videos of the... I don't know what the alcohol is called.

1802
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:04,190
I think it's Jepson's Malure.

1803
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:10,270
Have you guys seen those videos of people trying to say the Jepson's Malure and then...

1804
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:12,050
I'll have another.

1805
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,680
It's basically... I don't know what it tastes like, but...

1806
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,860
If you've had one, it's...

1807
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:28,360
Oh!

1808
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,840
Thank you!

1809
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:40,120
I just heard something.

1810
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:49,240
Basically, you try to say it, but it just tastes horrible.

1811
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,920
So people are going, Jepson's Malure.

1812
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,500
And then they drink it and then...

1813
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,300
Oh no!

1814
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,340
It's all messed up!

1815
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:02,680
What do I do with you?

1816
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,140
I'll dispose of it.

1817
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:11,540
Into the bin.

1818
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:12,640
Anyway, what was I saying?

1819
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,100
Oh yeah, it just tastes so horrible.

1820
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,980
People are just like, Jepson's Malure.

1821
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,120
And then they take it and they are like...

1822
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,700
I can't say it because it just tastes so horrible.

1823
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:32,060
I'm really curious though, but it sounds like it's actually awful.

1824
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:42,370
I use Malure for bets at festivals.

1825
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:43,330
No way!

1826
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:46,790
No way!

1827
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:54,890
Dang it, I still missed a secret note.

1828
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:58,810
Also, it goes so fast, I don't even have time to...

1829
01:39:59,330 --> 01:39:59,690
Yay!

1830
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:01,250
We bought all the stuff!

1831
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,030
Big spender.

1832
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:03,690
Buy all items in the gift shop.

1833
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:04,090
What?

1834
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:05,110
It says...

1835
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:10,470
The achievement had a typo.

1836
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:11,450
It said gift shop.

1837
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:13,310
Shot instead of gift shop.

1838
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:34,670
Something is pulling me in.

1839
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,550
Why do I keep coming back?

1840
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:39,810
Maybe it's not a typo.

1841
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:41,430
The gift shot.

1842
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:43,690
What if I leave?

1843
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:49,510
I'm not late!

1844
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:50,890
Am I?

1845
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:54,550
I'm late!

1846
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:56,490
Ew!

1847
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:58,970
It said are you scared of me?

1848
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:02,110
Oh my gosh, we just got here.

1849
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:03,030
Can you chill?

1850
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:06,910
Can you please calm down with the spookiness right now?

1851
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:11,270
I know, but the money is too good honestly.

1852
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:15,870
The money is too good for me to want to leave.

1853
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:17,670
Stinking ghosts.

1854
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:21,130
Let's see.

1855
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:23,230
We are fashionably late.

1856
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:26,210
Anything in here?

1857
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:27,370
Nope.

1858
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:28,250
Here?

1859
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:29,330
Just a bucket.

1860
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:31,110
I don't think we need anymore.

1861
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:43,350
Another day, another doll, another dollar.

1862
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:49,310
What else you have for me today Mr. Director?

1863
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:53,030
That doll looked at me.

1864
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:54,170
My face, my feet.

1865
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:56,130
That doll looked like me!

1866
01:41:56,850 --> 01:41:58,370
My face, my features, everything.

1867
01:41:58,590 --> 01:41:59,750
I threw it into the disposal.

1868
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:02,150
The director didn't comment on it.

1869
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,360
Freaky.

1870
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,880
Oh wow!

1871
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:21,300
OK.

1872
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:23,880
Wait, what's a foreign object?

1873
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:26,500
Place the doll inside the x-ray machine.

1874
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:28,540
Press one of the green buttons to make a shot.

1875
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,880
Use the same buttons to rotate the doll.

1876
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,400
Oh, like a screenshot.

1877
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,000
OK, got it.

1878
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,940
Like a picture.

1879
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,840
Make sure there are no foreign objects inside the doll.

1880
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:43,660
Teddy!

1881
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,220
Fidget spinner!

1882
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,800
I don't even know what I bought.

1883
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:51,740
I just bought everything.

1884
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:54,620
What's this?

1885
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,560
I will contact you today.

1886
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,040
The director must not notice anything.

1887
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:01,060
Don't be scared K.

1888
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:06,880
K for cactus.

1889
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,680
I just heard something go pew pew again.

1890
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:12,660
Someone's here.

1891
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:14,880
We got another little doll about...

1892
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:19,040
Wait, how is K going to... How is K going to contact us?

1893
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:21,620
OK.

1894
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:23,720
Alright, enter!

1895
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,280
And then what do I do?

1896
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:27,900
Sorry, I forgot again.

1897
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,000
Press on the green button.

1898
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:37,430
It has a heart?

1899
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:41,630
Is that a foreign object?

1900
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:45,670
Are you

1901
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:49,980
supposed to have that?

1902
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:56,080
No foreign objects inside.

1903
01:43:57,620 --> 01:43:58,140
OK.

1904
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,360
Alright, they are not supposed to have hearts.

1905
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:05,560
Human hearts.

1906
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,780
How am I supposed to... I'm so freaked out.

1907
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,500
When is K going to contact us?

1908
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:12,760
Alright, what are you saying?

1909
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,200
Alright, yes it was.

1910
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:15,960
Place the doll.

1911
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,520
Alright, so...

1912
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,820
This guy's got nothing inside him.

1913
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,400
Not even a brain.

1914
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,920
Stupid dummy doll.

1915
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,420
Alright.

1916
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,200
Let's go.

1917
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:34,960
You threw away a human heart.

1918
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:38,980
That's to the black market.

1919
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,120
Don't talk to dolls.

1920
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:42,620
They lie.

1921
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,060
What do you say?

1922
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:48,500
Sweet cheeks?

1923
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,920
That doesn't seem like a lie.

1924
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,740
These guys do have sweet cheeks.

1925
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,900
Oh my god!

1926
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:18,070
This game is really fun for how simple it is.

1927
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:22,150
That was very nice.

1928
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,130
I don't think that was.

1929
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:28,010
OK, wait.

1930
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:29,490
Anything inside it's mouth?

1931
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:30,230
I don't think so.

1932
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:37,030
The scratchy sounds you sometimes hear is from your task in the top left changing.

1933
01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:38,650
Oh, I see.

1934
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:40,090
Thank you.

1935
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:41,250
Thank you Fluffy.

1936
01:45:42,150 --> 01:45:43,210
You solved the mystery.

1937
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:46,930
The clown doll looked like...

1938
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:49,510
So funny.

1939
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:51,130
Very funny.

1940
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:56,530
They lie.

1941
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,030
They lie.

1942
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:01,270
He has teeth in him!

1943
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:08,390
Where did that come from?

1944
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:13,370
Does K stand for chair?

1945
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,640
Take a seat.

1946
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,880
I'm squatting.

1947
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:28,960
Clown?

1948
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,700
You think I threw him away?

1949
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:34,620
Wait, was K the clown and I threw him away?

1950
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,460
Wait, where did that note go anyway?

1951
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:42,360
Wait, the note that I...

1952
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,120
That K left, it's gone.

1953
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:46,640
Wait!

1954
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:59,030
OK, we got to go put a little here.

1955
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:00,690
Let's investigate you first.

1956
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:02,870
OK, nothing inside.

1957
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:05,630
What note?

1958
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:12,010
There was a blue note that K left that said I will come and don't be scared or whatever.

1959
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:14,230
Under the thing?

1960
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:15,530
What thing?

1961
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:17,890
Under this?

1962
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:19,010
No?

1963
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:23,420
The chair is gone.

1964
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:24,660
Oh yeah, you're right!

1965
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,420
Oh my gosh.

1966
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,120
I didn't even notice.

1967
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,560
Freaky.

1968
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:30,100
Gosh, this room.

1969
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,940
Oh, there is another note.

1970
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:34,780
Hold on.

1971
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,480
K, what are you trying to tell me?

1972
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:40,640
Something is changing in me.

1973
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,340
I don't feel right.

1974
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,580
My reflection in the mirror doesn't look like me anymore.

1975
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,700
The director knows he is doing this.

1976
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:54,560
All the notes that K leaves are also yellow, but the one that K left on the monitor was blue.

1977
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:56,880
I don't think it's actually K.

1978
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,980
I don't think it's actually K, you guys.

1979
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:10,020
Maybe K has changed beyond recognition.

1980
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:11,360
Do

1981
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:17,070
you think the dolls are former workers?

1982
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:18,910
Maybe.

1983
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:20,610
Wow, how dapper.

1984
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:22,670
Are you K?

1985
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:26,770
I am K, destroyer of worlds.

1986
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:31,790
OK, seems fine.

1987
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:31,830
What?

1988
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:34,090
Maybe they got a new notepad.

1989
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:36,750
I somewhat doubt it.

1990
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:39,470
I somewhat doubt it.

1991
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:40,650
Sorry, I'm just looking around.

1992
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:41,690
I'm on lookout.

1993
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:45,830
That one is super haunted.

1994
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:47,570
He wasn't.

1995
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:48,630
He was just fine.

1996
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:51,510
Oh, another guy is super dapper.

1997
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:57,810
I don't like when they turn off the lights.

1998
01:48:57,810 --> 01:49:00,850
But I'm glad we had our jack-o-lantern.

1999
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:02,110
He was very bright.

2000
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:06,470
Haunted with style.

2001
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:09,650
Haunted with style.

2002
01:49:12,190 --> 01:49:13,910
And nothing inside of there.

2003
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,070
Oh my god.

2004
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:16,170
Stop, please!

2005
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:17,590
Stop turning off the lights!

2006
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:18,830
It's my least favorite thing!

2007
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:22,850
Oh, there is a note over there.

2008
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:34,090
No one knows about the factory.

2009
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,330
No one even heard about it.

2010
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:36,690
These dolls aren't being sold anywhere.

2011
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:38,630
Sweet cheeks, is this place even real?

2012
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:41,090
Oh my god, stop!

2013
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:44,390
Guys, they keep turning off the light.

2014
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:47,890
And the disposal is gone again.

2015
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:48,730
Oh my god.

2016
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:49,990
This guy was fine though.

2017
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:51,350
I think.

2018
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:51,930
I don't know.

2019
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:54,150
As soon as I got you, everything bad happened.

2020
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:55,190
Get out of my sight.

2021
01:49:58,830 --> 01:49:59,050
What?

2022
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:00,010
Wait, what was it?

2023
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:04,580
Sorry, sir.

2024
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:06,560
What did I... What was the issue?

2025
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:09,400
I did the x-ray, did I not?

2026
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:10,440
He had nothing in there.

2027
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:15,710
It wasn't.

2028
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:17,350
Not very nice at all.

2029
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:24,180
He was turning off the lights.

2030
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:29,140
Every time I grabbed him, it was turning off the lights, I think.

2031
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,140
Oh, the disposal machine is gone.

2032
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:33,720
Wait, I think someone mentioned that.

2033
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,580
Yeah, I think it's outside probably.

2034
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:47,070
Oh my god, demon baby.

2035
01:50:48,590 --> 01:50:49,210
He's gone.

2036
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,190
Be gone.

2037
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:55,990
I have no time for your nonsense.

2038
01:50:56,990 --> 01:51:00,430
I have no time for demon nonsense, OK?

2039
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:03,850
I guess she's fine.

2040
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:05,850
Place.

2041
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:10,030
What?

2042
01:51:15,090 --> 01:51:15,870
Oh no.

2043
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:19,270
Oh guys, I'm not gonna be... You know what?

2044
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:22,130
I don't need to make so much money anyway, because...

2045
01:51:22,130 --> 01:51:25,890
I bought everything that I wanted, but I'm getting weak.

2046
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:27,490
Alright, too many fingers.

2047
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,030
Got it.

2048
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:28,630
Sorry, sir.

2049
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:33,410
Sorry, sir.

2050
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:40,390
You shouldn't have come back.

2051
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:41,970
Oh my god, what just happened?

2052
01:51:43,410 --> 01:51:45,150
It transported me!

2053
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:47,270
Oh my god.

2054
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:51,670
This game is so...

2055
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:54,270
This game is so...

2056
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:56,330
This game is so...

2057
01:51:57,150 --> 01:51:58,930
Oh no, that's my cactus.

2058
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:04,370
You think I can leave?

2059
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:07,070
Sweet cheeks.

2060
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:15,570
Doesn't seem like it does anything.

2061
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:19,550
It's not turning off lights.

2062
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:21,550
It's being just a doll.

2063
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:22,330
Fingers?

2064
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:23,030
Oh, thank you.

2065
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:25,550
Four, four...

2066
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,330
OK, I mean five and five.

2067
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:28,010
You know what I mean.

2068
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:34,250
I wanna go home.

2069
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:50,970
Anyway...

2070
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:53,350
Is she doing that?

2071
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,620
I think it's her.

2072
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:08,990
I can't tell if those are my footsteps and I just never heard them before or if it's somebody else's.

2073
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:11,710
Hello?

2074
01:53:15,610 --> 01:53:20,590
I don't know if it's cursed or if that was just a little funky moment, you know?

2075
01:53:21,450 --> 01:53:22,350
A little prank.

2076
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:26,570
A little funny prank, right?

2077
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:27,450
I have spiders.

2078
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:31,130
Because I picked her up again and nothing happened, so...

2079
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:32,910
I think she's fine, right?

2080
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:35,070
Right?

2081
01:53:35,150 --> 01:53:35,830
She's probably OK.

2082
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:40,050
A little funny haha.

2083
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:46,990
Well, I guess we'll see.

2084
01:53:48,670 --> 01:53:49,430
Yeah!

2085
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:50,550
See?

2086
01:53:53,370 --> 01:53:54,890
Everything's fine.

2087
01:53:58,990 --> 01:54:00,510
Everything's fine.

2088
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,100
She's got a bug in her.

2089
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:09,360
Matara can't leave this place.

2090
01:54:13,850 --> 01:54:14,250
Alright.

2091
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:15,550
Nice.

2092
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:18,130
Nice.

2093
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:20,690
Sweet cheeks.

2094
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:21,590
Let me check her fingers.

2095
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:22,670
Alright.

2096
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:24,850
That was also, I think, our first one.

2097
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:26,390
The one that I got wrong initially.

2098
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:31,210
I think that was our first one wrong with too many fingers.

2099
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:32,210
You know?

2100
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:34,050
I never had one with too many fingers.

2101
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:37,710
We had the ones that were missing fingers, but...

2102
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:41,590
I like how all these parts just hang around here.

2103
01:54:41,710 --> 01:54:43,530
Let's just say...

2104
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:45,090
Hair color change?

2105
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:45,850
What?

2106
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:51,310
I don't think so.

2107
01:54:57,250 --> 01:55:02,450
Is that a doll behind the screen?

2108
01:55:03,550 --> 01:55:03,790
Here?

2109
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:05,590
I don't see anything.

2110
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:07,890
Sweet cheeks.

2111
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:08,690
What's that?

2112
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:11,110
Disposal.

2113
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:11,890
That's what that is.

2114
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,890
That's what that is.

2115
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:39,010
Yeah, that's where I was going to go.

2116
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:40,610
Hide in the locker room.

2117
01:55:43,390 --> 01:55:44,430
That's where I was going to go.

2118
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:45,490
Okay.

2119
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:48,210
What if I yeeted him?

2120
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:04,210
He's a ginger.

2121
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:05,030
Should we trust him?

2122
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:16,950
Yeah?

2123
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:24,370
Sorry, I went to the bathroom.

2124
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:26,190
Sorry.

2125
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:36,290
Do we trust him?

2126
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:40,610
A few days?

2127
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:48,590
Okay.

2128
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:49,830
Okay.

2129
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:56,570
Yeah.

2130
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:01,650
Oh no.

2131
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:09,290
I don't know.

2132
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:12,170
I don't trust the director, but I don't think I trust him either.

2133
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:13,270
Right?

2134
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:15,490
I wonder if there are multiple endings.

2135
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:16,950
Actually, you are right.

2136
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:18,310
There are multiple endings.

2137
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:19,610
There are two endings.

2138
01:57:21,130 --> 01:57:23,270
Let's just trust him for now and if we're done, we're done.

2139
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:29,990
Potty!

2140
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:33,930
Sorry.

2141
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:34,050
Sorry.

2142
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:43,450
One doll, green eyes.

2143
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:44,130
Alright.

2144
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:44,990
Easy.

2145
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:46,950
One doll, green eyes.

2146
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:48,250
We can do that.

2147
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:50,570
Look at that.

2148
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:52,030
Immediate.

2149
01:57:52,190 --> 01:57:52,890
Is she possessed?

2150
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:56,650
Okay, she doesn't say bad things.

2151
01:57:59,330 --> 01:58:02,110
She has no foreign objects in her?

2152
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:04,250
I think we're fine.

2153
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:05,110
Right?

2154
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:10,230
I'll go get the box.

2155
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:12,170
Fingers?

2156
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,050
Oh, thank you.

2157
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:14,370
Yeah, let me check the fingers.

2158
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:18,110
Five, five.

2159
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:24,070
Yeah, no extra fingers inside her.

2160
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:27,650
I can't believe we just saw K and he spoke to us.

2161
01:58:28,430 --> 01:58:29,710
That was kind of wild.

2162
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:33,310
That was kind of ridiculous.

2163
01:58:35,410 --> 01:58:37,270
You'll never be alone again.

2164
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:40,510
The whispers are starting to get way more frequent.

2165
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,870
I gotta up my haunting game.

2166
01:58:44,970 --> 01:58:47,590
I gotta up my haunting game.

2167
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:49,950
Seriously.

2168
01:58:50,910 --> 01:58:52,270
They're so good at this.

2169
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:56,810
I had a feeling K would be a doll.

2170
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:58,030
Yeah, me too.

2171
01:58:58,910 --> 01:59:01,030
I just, you know...

2172
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:07,070
I don't know what I expected to happen though.

2173
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:10,790
I'm not sure what I expected to happen.

2174
01:59:11,190 --> 01:59:14,030
So, I guess to get both endings...

2175
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:17,030
Maybe you have to...

2176
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:19,250
Like, yeet him.

2177
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:19,890
I don't know.

2178
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:26,430
But I don't know if I'm willing to go through the whole game again just to get the second ending.

2179
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:26,970
You know what I mean?

2180
01:59:29,290 --> 01:59:30,170
Are you haunted?

2181
01:59:34,230 --> 01:59:36,130
Signs say don't talk to the dolls.

2182
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:36,830
They lie.

2183
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:37,710
That is true.

2184
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:39,510
That is true.

2185
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:46,030
And honestly, if we were bad guys, or rather if the director was the bad guy...

2186
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:47,490
Why would he 1.

2187
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:48,910
Pay me and 2.

2188
01:59:49,010 --> 01:59:51,790
Why would he want to dispose of the haunted dolls?

2189
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:52,830
You know?

2190
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:56,310
You should unironically do a haunting ASMR.

2191
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:58,190
Maybe.

2192
01:59:59,570 --> 02:00:00,690
That was very nice.

2193
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:10,770
10 hours of silence sometimes interrupted by haunting Minto ASMR.

2194
02:00:13,890 --> 02:00:14,730
Oh, sorry.

2195
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:15,210
Fingers.

2196
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:18,570
I think we're good.

2197
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:23,230
Noise.

2198
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:26,150
Oh my god.

2199
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:27,770
This one is so cute.

2200
02:00:30,450 --> 02:00:31,890
I love this one.

2201
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:37,430
This one is fun.

2202
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:40,010
I want to give him heterochromia.

2203
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:44,710
No.

2204
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:45,810
Guys, I can't see.

2205
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:46,950
Guys, I can't see.

2206
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:47,390
I'm scared.

2207
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:47,710
I'm scared.

2208
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:48,050
I'm scared.

2209
02:00:48,170 --> 02:00:48,350
I'm scared.

2210
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,730
I'm scared.

2211
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:50,530
God.

2212
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:52,910
Oh my god.

2213
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:10,490
I liked you.

2214
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:12,270
I liked you.

2215
02:01:14,910 --> 02:01:16,450
I also heard laughing.

2216
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,530
I think we have a clown amongst us.

2217
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:23,850
Or maybe not.

2218
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:24,430
I don't know.

2219
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:28,330
The games aren't lagging though.

2220
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:32,290
Oh gosh.

2221
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:35,950
It was not very nice.

2222
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:41,310
Do you have anything else?

2223
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:42,730
Any extra toes?

2224
02:01:44,410 --> 02:01:46,270
No rips and tears?

2225
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:50,210
A clown you say.

2226
02:01:56,430 --> 02:01:57,510
I think it's fine.

2227
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,340
This one is...

2228
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:13,980
This one is messed up, but I don't think we repair this, right?

2229
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:16,680
Yeah, we just throw them away.

2230
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:21,100
Yeah, it's too much work.

2231
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:23,660
We can replace parts, but it's too much work to pull them apart.

2232
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:27,460
Sweet cheeks.

2233
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:36,500
Young Sheldon.

2234
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:40,940
We get so much variety out of this guy.

2235
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:42,060
Wait, what is this?

2236
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,220
Oh, that's our button.

2237
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,600
It moved all the way over here.

2238
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:57,750
That's funny.

2239
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:06,270
The anomalies, I suppose you call them, are so funny in this game.

2240
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:10,790
Alright, we got our little dapper bunch again.

2241
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:15,390
I feel like I'm hearing something, but maybe not.

2242
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:16,410
I don't know.

2243
02:03:17,710 --> 02:03:19,050
Oh, he's got a heart.

2244
02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:20,610
No foreign objects.

2245
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:25,630
Did he do that right?

2246
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:29,850
Now it's hard to tell who's doing what.

2247
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:34,790
Those look like windows, but does that mean we...

2248
02:03:35,610 --> 02:03:37,010
We have the night shift?

2249
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:43,190
Thank you, director.

2250
02:03:44,990 --> 02:03:45,950
Go home.

2251
02:03:46,990 --> 02:03:48,110
Will it let me in?

2252
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:56,650
Yeah, it was only that first day that we could have, I guess, taken advantage of the extra...

2253
02:03:57,790 --> 02:03:59,610
The others never left, yeah.

2254
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:05,570
OK, I'm going home.

2255
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:09,010
We didn't find any notes this time really, but that's OK.

2256
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:10,970
That's fine.

2257
02:04:11,270 --> 02:04:12,730
I think we're still getting the lore.

2258
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:21,200
Day 4 complete.

2259
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:23,980
We made some errors, you guys.

2260
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:25,980
Oh, but we only lost $60.

2261
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:35,420
This is easy money.

2262
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:39,380
Gosh, we can leave now.

2263
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:41,900
We can leave now.

2264
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:43,280
We can go find another job.

2265
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:46,160
I saw him today, or what's left of him.

2266
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:48,480
The worker before me, the one who disappeared.

2267
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:50,700
He's still here, but he's a doll now.

2268
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:56,260
He spoke to me, said the director did this to him, that everything is a lie, and I'm next.

2269
02:04:57,820 --> 02:05:01,140
I should have left while I had the chance, but it's too late now.

2270
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:03,720
It all started in the factory, and it can only end here.

2271
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:07,520
This company must have the slowest output in the world.

2272
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,600
It's because Day 5?

2273
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:15,500
The sign is crooked.

2274
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:29,520
We take our time with quality control so that we can...

2275
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:32,980
Everything is whispering at me now.

2276
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:36,520
So we can ensure the highest quality.

2277
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:41,520
If all else perished and he remained, I will still continue to be...

2278
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:47,240
And if all else remained and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty straight...

2279
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,840
Why is it so ominous?

2280
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:55,110
What's this?

2281
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:58,330
I remember my hands, flesh and bone.

2282
02:05:58,390 --> 02:05:59,130
Now they're different.

2283
02:05:59,270 --> 02:05:59,930
They don't ache.

2284
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:01,190
They don't move the same.

2285
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:02,710
I wonder if you've noticed it yet.

2286
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:03,830
You will.

2287
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:09,070
Niels, happy birthday!

2288
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:12,030
Can I have a birthday smooch?

2289
02:06:13,730 --> 02:06:15,290
Just a little kiss on the cheek.

2290
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:16,650
A tiny little peck.

2291
02:06:17,330 --> 02:06:19,070
You sure are asking for a lot.

2292
02:06:20,610 --> 02:06:22,770
You sure are asking for a lot.

2293
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:24,310
Thank you for the Akusupa!

2294
02:06:24,970 --> 02:06:25,650
Happy birthday!

2295
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:28,990
Sorry I couldn't sing happy birthday to you.

2296
02:06:31,070 --> 02:06:35,640
Oh, hold on.

2297
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,880
I keep hearing a bunch of noises going on.

2298
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:43,340
Oh, it's the lights flickering.

2299
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:49,600
Happy birthday to you!

2300
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,700
Happy birthday to you!

2301
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:55,540
Happy birthday Niels!

2302
02:06:56,020 --> 02:06:57,460
How do I say your last name?

2303
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,420
I'm just going to say Niels.

2304
02:06:59,180 --> 02:06:59,900
Niels!

2305
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:04,660
Happy birthday to you!

2306
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:22,010
Another day, another dollar, another doll hair.

2307
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:28,090
What is...

2308
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:34,230
Oh wow!

2309
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:37,310
Okay!

2310
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:40,810
Wow!

2311
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:42,130
We are...

2312
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:45,150
Beware of something.

2313
02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:52,310
We are expediting the problems with these dolls.

2314
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:53,070
It's crazy.

2315
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:55,910
Sweet cheeks!

2316
02:07:59,230 --> 02:08:02,210
Why are all the lights flickering so much?

2317
02:08:08,810 --> 02:08:10,490
Okay, he's got nothing in there.

2318
02:08:13,350 --> 02:08:14,610
How do I... Oh, place.

2319
02:08:15,350 --> 02:08:15,930
Place him.

2320
02:08:18,170 --> 02:08:19,170
He seems fine to me.

2321
02:08:20,630 --> 02:08:22,530
I like how it's like no radiation.

2322
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:25,370
Do I just... That's it?

2323
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:27,950
And then let's check his toes.

2324
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:32,730
Oh my god.

2325
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:37,490
They have a nice little tune going on though.

2326
02:08:38,190 --> 02:08:39,210
I think he's fine.

2327
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:43,430
Examine him while he's in there.

2328
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:47,510
Oh my gosh!

2329
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:49,490
He's got... Sweet cheeks!

2330
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:50,790
Oh!

2331
02:08:51,370 --> 02:08:54,410
He's got like a mark of... Okay.

2332
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:56,510
Not sweet cheeks.

2333
02:08:58,850 --> 02:09:00,290
Mark of the devil.

2334
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:04,850
Alrighty.

2335
02:09:06,130 --> 02:09:07,070
I mark.

2336
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,190
I like the little angel outfit.

2337
02:09:10,550 --> 02:09:11,010
It's cute.

2338
02:09:13,970 --> 02:09:15,450
Okay, what do you say?

2339
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:17,330
Hello!

2340
02:09:19,690 --> 02:09:22,090
I don't like... I really don't like the blinking.

2341
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:24,590
I really... Oh gosh.

2342
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:26,950
I really don't like the blinking now.

2343
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:28,270
Okay.

2344
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:32,750
Seems fine.

2345
02:09:32,990 --> 02:09:36,470
It's kind of hard to... This one is hardest I think because...

2346
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:39,090
You have to have it at like the correct, you know.

2347
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:40,430
Alright.

2348
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:41,790
Oh wait, she's fine.

2349
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:45,230
What?

2350
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:48,190
My sheets do the same thing under UV.

2351
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:54,730
What do you mean by...

2352
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:56,250
Oh gosh, this game.

2353
02:09:56,530 --> 02:09:57,530
What do you mean by that?

2354
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:06,790
If you encounter a doll with steel nails embedded in it, treat it as an extremely dangerous object.

2355
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:10,810
This doll poses a serious threat and may interfere with equipment or cause harm.

2356
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:13,890
Dispose this doll immediately by any means necessary.

2357
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:18,430
Exercise caution during removal to prevent further risk to yourself or the machinery.

2358
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:24,770
Report the incident to your supervisor as soon as the doll is disposed of, ensuring that no additional hazards remain in the area.

2359
02:10:27,590 --> 02:10:29,630
Yeah, we had that doll earlier.

2360
02:10:31,690 --> 02:10:31,970
Hello.

2361
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:41,170
We had that doll earlier.

2362
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:45,510
Hello.

2363
02:10:46,150 --> 02:10:50,870
I think she's not good.

2364
02:10:52,990 --> 02:10:56,050
That means like some children have been getting like...

2365
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:02,230
Some kid got this doll and then probably like a black light for Christmas and was just like...

2366
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:07,850
And then just sees like all this blood splatter all over their doll.

2367
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:12,030
Do you?

2368
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:12,090
Do you?

2369
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:15,510
Do you actually?

2370
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:18,430
Oh wait, hold on.

2371
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:21,530
Or the marking is bad though.

2372
02:11:21,690 --> 02:11:23,950
Well, it means it's dirty at least, right?

2373
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:30,730
It's just got nastiness all over it.

2374
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:31,690
Right?

2375
02:11:33,390 --> 02:11:34,730
I think she's fine.

2376
02:11:39,630 --> 02:11:40,750
I love you.

2377
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:40,910
I love you.

2378
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:44,810
Come here little doll.

2379
02:11:45,630 --> 02:11:47,690
No rips, no tears, no extra fingers.

2380
02:11:49,110 --> 02:11:50,950
Alright, into the x-ray.

2381
02:11:52,630 --> 02:11:53,350
Nothing.

2382
02:11:54,510 --> 02:11:55,550
Into the UV.

2383
02:11:58,290 --> 02:12:00,070
Oh gosh, she ages.

2384
02:12:00,970 --> 02:12:02,530
She like becomes a real grandma.

2385
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:04,190
Okay.

2386
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:04,290
Okay.

2387
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:16,020
Sorry.

2388
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:18,860
I don't know why I did that.

2389
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:19,860
I'm so sorry.

2390
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:25,680
I don't know why I did that.

2391
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,900
Yeah, I'm on autopilot.

2392
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:33,800
Parent of a child with special needs orders a personalized doll with quite unique features and interesting looking shapes.

2393
02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:35,800
Purple eyes and says hello.

2394
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:36,260
Okay.

2395
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:36,400
Okay.

2396
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:40,980
Literally on autopilot.

2397
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:41,920
Oh my gosh.

2398
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:44,680
She was too perfect.

2399
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:48,900
She had to be disposed of.

2400
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:51,420
That's a first.

2401
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:54,920
Stop oozing ectoplasm all over the dolls.

2402
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:56,000
I'm sorry.

2403
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:59,280
It's just how my hands are.

2404
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:01,580
Emo doll.

2405
02:13:02,820 --> 02:13:03,540
Crawling.

2406
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,440
I'm scared.

2407
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:15,050
Okay, seems fine.

2408
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:17,150
Nice.

2409
02:13:18,330 --> 02:13:18,990
Oh gosh.

2410
02:13:19,810 --> 02:13:20,850
Seems fine.

2411
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:22,550
National warning.

2412
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:23,590
Did you buy a Minto doll?

2413
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:26,310
You may have to check her under her dress.

2414
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,730
No!

2415
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:29,350
Don't do that.

2416
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:31,670
That's actually...

2417
02:13:32,330 --> 02:13:34,350
I was really embarrassed to...

2418
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:37,010
Wait, what did it say?

2419
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:40,070
Purple eyes and gray hair.

2420
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:42,330
Well, this one has purple eyes.

2421
02:13:42,410 --> 02:13:42,790
Let's see.

2422
02:13:44,070 --> 02:13:45,450
Dang it, it does not say hello.

2423
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:52,030
I was embarrassed if I got like the dolls where you can change the clothes and stuff.

2424
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:56,130
So I purposefully got one where you could change the clothes.

2425
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:57,730
Okay, into the disposal.

2426
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:02,870
Stop blinking please.

2427
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:05,390
I don't like this.

2428
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:10,190
Why was it day 5 question mark even?

2429
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:13,810
Oh, there is the demon baby.

2430
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:14,430
I heard him.

2431
02:14:15,170 --> 02:14:16,110
Go away demon.

2432
02:14:18,190 --> 02:14:19,290
Just balding.

2433
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:21,510
Purple eyes and says hello!

2434
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:22,710
Oh my gosh.

2435
02:14:23,230 --> 02:14:24,090
Purple eyes says hello.

2436
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:26,170
Nothing inside.

2437
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:31,390
Crawling in my skin.

2438
02:14:35,090 --> 02:14:35,290
Hello!

2439
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:38,430
Thank you so much for the...

2440
02:14:38,430 --> 02:14:42,530
My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath.

2441
02:14:42,670 --> 02:14:46,050
A source of invisible delight, but necessary.

2442
02:14:47,410 --> 02:14:48,210
Heathcliff.

2443
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:49,890
Is that like the...

2444
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:51,310
What are those?

2445
02:14:51,470 --> 02:14:52,570
The chocolate bars?

2446
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:56,790
Alright, order number 1.

2447
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:58,830
Let's go get the box.

2448
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:05,770
I didn't hear that one.

2449
02:15:05,850 --> 02:15:07,290
Sorry, I'm too fast for you ghosts.

2450
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:08,470
You're gonna have to speak up.

2451
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:15,170
You're gonna have to speak up because I'm moving fast and you're not whispering loud enough.

2452
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,060
The light is getting pretty craziness.

2453
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:28,100
I wish I could pick up more than one thing at a time.

2454
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,140
It's a withering heights quote.

2455
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:48,610
You little bitch.

2456
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:49,790
Get out of my sight.

2457
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:51,830
You!

2458
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:52,910
Get out of here.

2459
02:15:54,490 --> 02:15:55,270
Thank you.

2460
02:15:56,910 --> 02:15:58,950
I'm sick of being clowned on.

2461
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:00,830
Thank you.

2462
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:02,490
I'm trying to do my job here.

2463
02:16:02,670 --> 02:16:04,030
I'm just trying to be an honest worker.

2464
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:11,350
I'm just trying to be an honest worker.

2465
02:16:12,970 --> 02:16:16,170
I do wonder what happens if you keep the doors open though.

2466
02:16:19,910 --> 02:16:23,250
Gosh, we can continue.

2467
02:16:29,410 --> 02:16:30,470
A knife.

2468
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:34,590
A knife.

2469
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:38,970
Oh no.

2470
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:47,080
Is that you?

2471
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:49,640
No.

2472
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:51,560
I think the lights just turned off.

2473
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:56,020
A knife.

2474
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:02,180
I hate this room because this guy is always clicking.

2475
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:04,140
Demon baby?

2476
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:11,320
The demon baby is so funny.

2477
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,920
All you just hear is...

2478
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:16,300
What if I...oh.

2479
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:19,740
What if I made this doll to become the order, you know?

2480
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:21,080
What hair are we going to get?

2481
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:27,410
Cute!

2482
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:29,770
Actually I love that.

2483
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:33,010
How miraculous ladybug of you.

2484
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:36,330
What do you say?

2485
02:17:37,290 --> 02:17:38,210
Sweet cheeks.

2486
02:17:42,330 --> 02:17:43,410
Sweet cheeks.

2487
02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:51,780
That's what I'm going to say from now on instead of thank you.

2488
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:52,680
Sweet cheeks.

2489
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:00,080
What's your name, Miku?

2490
02:18:06,710 --> 02:18:07,330
What do you say?

2491
02:18:07,870 --> 02:18:08,150
Hello.

2492
02:18:09,170 --> 02:18:10,150
What's inside of you?

2493
02:18:10,970 --> 02:18:11,570
Nothing.

2494
02:18:12,990 --> 02:18:14,230
What's on you?

2495
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:19,320
Nothing?

2496
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:20,020
Okay.

2497
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:22,640
I think she's good.

2498
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:25,960
Sweet cheeks.

2499
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:27,700
Noice.

2500
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:32,620
What about you?

2501
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:33,540
This guy looks haunted.

2502
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:34,700
There is something wrong with him.

2503
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:38,400
Oh my god.

2504
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:39,280
What's inside you?

2505
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:44,200
It doesn't show up as anything, but do you see his mouth?

2506
02:18:49,310 --> 02:18:50,230
That's crazy.

2507
02:18:52,050 --> 02:18:53,450
Radioactive!

2508
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:55,450
Radioactive!

2509
02:18:59,090 --> 02:18:59,790
Alright.

2510
02:19:00,630 --> 02:19:01,870
No rips, no tears.

2511
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:03,510
No extra fingers.

2512
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:06,190
Sweet cheeks.

2513
02:19:09,860 --> 02:19:12,940
To the garbage.

2514
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:18,940
Gosh.

2515
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:24,340
No.

2516
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:27,580
No, I don't like that.

2517
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:28,440
Oh my god.

2518
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:32,460
Find all dolls?

2519
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:35,180
What?

2520
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:37,500
I don't like this.

2521
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:41,420
I hear one laughing.

2522
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:46,360
Where are you laughing from?

2523
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:46,900
Oh right here.

2524
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,220
What do I do with you?

2525
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:51,160
Doll found.

2526
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:51,540
Okay.

2527
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:54,760
Oh there is a note.

2528
02:19:57,380 --> 02:20:00,140
The air feels thicker, heavier, like it's pressing down on me.

2529
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,240
I saw myself in a reflection.

2530
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:03,160
For a second I didn't recognize my own face.

2531
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:04,120
Was it ever mine?

2532
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:09,540
Yeah, I wanted a treasure.

2533
02:20:13,890 --> 02:20:14,930
Let's check in here.

2534
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:22,410
I think I just heard something whisper, run.

2535
02:20:24,010 --> 02:20:24,450
Creepy.

2536
02:20:25,730 --> 02:20:27,990
I don't hear any giggling, so not in here.

2537
02:20:29,430 --> 02:20:31,670
Is there like a secret time limit?

2538
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:36,830
Oh my god.

2539
02:20:37,150 --> 02:20:38,390
No, the door is open.

2540
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:40,490
No, we hate that.

2541
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:41,230
Oh, there is one.

2542
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:46,830
Yikes.

2543
02:20:47,130 --> 02:20:47,890
It's kind of cute.

2544
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:51,370
They are kind of cute, I'm not going to lie.

2545
02:20:53,050 --> 02:20:54,270
Can you fix me?

2546
02:20:55,770 --> 02:20:58,290
Said one of the dolls, or the whispers.

2547
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:04,470
That scared me though.

2548
02:21:04,770 --> 02:21:07,710
The megaphone upstairs, or above the door.

2549
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:09,750
Freaked me out.

2550
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:19,150
Okay, you think I'm going to have to go downstairs?

2551
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,510
Are you scared?

2552
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:35,960
Why is this open then?

2553
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:38,500
Oh snap!

2554
02:21:39,870 --> 02:21:43,640
Oh, it wasn't me!

2555
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:46,880
I'm sorry!

2556
02:21:55,930 --> 02:21:58,230
This is messed up!

2557
02:21:58,670 --> 02:21:59,890
This is so messed up!

2558
02:22:01,090 --> 02:22:03,490
I'm a baritone, but a tenor when you play.

2559
02:22:04,510 --> 02:22:05,230
Spooky game.

2560
02:22:05,450 --> 02:22:06,630
Did something just fart?

2561
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:11,290
Oh, I think it was my cat.

2562
02:22:15,310 --> 02:22:16,890
Did you guys hear that in the game?

2563
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:19,150
That was me, sorry.

2564
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:20,410
Paz!

2565
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:21,910
Paz, was that you?

2566
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:22,930
No.

2567
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:26,170
She was just stretching.

2568
02:22:28,250 --> 02:22:30,430
Did you guys hear it, or am I crazy?

2569
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:35,390
I guess I'll smell it in a second.

2570
02:22:35,630 --> 02:22:36,290
Oh no.

2571
02:22:45,470 --> 02:22:48,550
This game said nothing scary would happen.

2572
02:22:49,990 --> 02:22:52,450
They were like, don't worry.

2573
02:22:53,630 --> 02:22:55,350
Nothing will jump out at you.

2574
02:22:55,690 --> 02:22:57,370
I guess that's true, technically.

2575
02:22:58,690 --> 02:22:59,430
Oh, you're good.

2576
02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:04,510
What are you doing Paz?

2577
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:05,630
Are you waking up?

2578
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:07,930
Hold on, I'm going to say hello to her.

2579
02:23:09,050 --> 02:23:10,890
Paz, what are you doing girl?

2580
02:23:11,390 --> 02:23:13,010
What are you doing baby girl?

2581
02:23:13,270 --> 02:23:14,690
Yeah, you're so cute.

2582
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:16,130
You're so sweet.

2583
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:21,050
My little stinky cat.

2584
02:23:25,850 --> 02:23:29,010
Next, we got to fix this guy.

2585
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:35,770
I'm assuming the ones that are broken are like... fine.

2586
02:23:36,530 --> 02:23:37,970
You know, like they're not possessed.

2587
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:39,770
You just have to fix them.

2588
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:41,470
I'm assuming.

2589
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:44,410
Is that door downstairs still open?

2590
02:23:44,530 --> 02:23:45,130
I don't know.

2591
02:23:45,530 --> 02:23:47,210
I don't know why it was open to begin with.

2592
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:48,790
Maybe... Oh my gosh, it is.

2593
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:51,530
But it wouldn't let me shut it, you know.

2594
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:55,010
I'm wondering if it opens just in case...

2595
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:56,510
Shut up!

2596
02:23:56,990 --> 02:23:58,690
Yeah, see, it won't let me shut it.

2597
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:03,010
Oh my god, we can go in here and stuff though?

2598
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:07,610
It's kind of weird that we can... Wait, why can't we go down here actually in the first place?

2599
02:24:10,510 --> 02:24:10,910
Exit?

2600
02:24:11,410 --> 02:24:13,370
Oh, oh, like...

2601
02:24:13,370 --> 02:24:14,590
Why are we allowed down here?

2602
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:17,450
I just brought this baby doll with me.

2603
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:21,470
Huh.

2604
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:24,390
Exploration time.

2605
02:24:24,790 --> 02:24:25,810
Okay, I'm taking him with me.

2606
02:24:25,970 --> 02:24:26,910
This is my hostage.

2607
02:24:28,450 --> 02:24:31,150
This is my hostage, so...

2608
02:24:31,150 --> 02:24:32,130
Probably more notes.

2609
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:34,470
I imagine that the dolls...

2610
02:24:34,470 --> 02:24:35,530
The, uh, what's it called?

2611
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:36,110
Girlies?

2612
02:24:36,910 --> 02:24:40,830
That were hiding around probably could hide down here.

2613
02:24:40,930 --> 02:24:45,430
It's RNG, and so they just open it up just in case.

2614
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:50,150
Just in case, so you don't get softlocked, you know?

2615
02:24:56,090 --> 02:25:00,250
The generator is running and the sound of it freaked me out.

2616
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:03,090
Oh, there is a note!

2617
02:25:06,010 --> 02:25:07,210
They whispering.

2618
02:25:08,410 --> 02:25:09,770
They're telling me secrets.

2619
02:25:10,130 --> 02:25:11,010
They told me about him.

2620
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:12,550
They told me about you.

2621
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:16,730
Okay, I don't think K is okay anymore, you guys.

2622
02:25:17,330 --> 02:25:19,710
Guys, I don't think K is okay anymore.

2623
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:25,530
I think K is, uh, lost a little bit.

2624
02:25:29,970 --> 02:25:31,490
K was never okay.

2625
02:25:32,250 --> 02:25:34,950
He used to be okay, now he's just K.

2626
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:37,310
Now he's just K.

2627
02:25:39,610 --> 02:25:40,730
Oh, another one.

2628
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:43,630
I'm becoming one of them.

2629
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:44,410
I can't stop it.

2630
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:45,310
I don't have much time left.

2631
02:25:45,350 --> 02:25:47,110
If you're reading this, it's too late for you too!

2632
02:25:54,850 --> 02:25:55,530
Uh...

2633
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:02,200
I don't think we're K either.

2634
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:06,160
Uh-oh.

2635
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:08,300
We might be in trouble.

2636
02:26:12,730 --> 02:26:14,330
The others never left.

2637
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:16,410
The others are all dolls.

2638
02:26:16,590 --> 02:26:19,150
How many people worked at this factory?

2639
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:25,580
Okay, let's give you an eyeball.

2640
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:28,120
You are getting a green eyeball.

2641
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:32,350
Alright.

2642
02:26:35,250 --> 02:26:36,290
And we checked.

2643
02:26:38,070 --> 02:26:41,770
We checked his UV and his X-ray.

2644
02:26:42,510 --> 02:26:43,230
He says hello.

2645
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:43,950
He's all good.

2646
02:26:44,390 --> 02:26:45,950
We walked around with him a ton.

2647
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:51,730
Wait, what do you mean I missed one?

2648
02:26:56,010 --> 02:26:56,570
Stop!

2649
02:26:56,570 --> 02:26:56,650
Stop!

2650
02:27:00,290 --> 02:27:01,690
I missed one what?

2651
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:02,530
A doll?

2652
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:16,280
I heard the Satan baby.

2653
02:27:18,860 --> 02:27:20,320
He's probably around.

2654
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:21,680
Just, you know...

2655
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,780
Let him be.

2656
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:28,940
They silenced you.

2657
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:30,620
And so will I.

2658
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:33,660
Nice.

2659
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:37,360
Creepy.

2660
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:42,600
Fingers, hands, toes.

2661
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:44,340
I love you.

2662
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:50,040
Nothing inside that brain of yours.

2663
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:52,200
Okay.

2664
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:55,900
We haven't gotten the nail doll.

2665
02:27:55,900 --> 02:28:00,340
Well, we actually technically got him in the first day.

2666
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:01,900
Which was probably...

2667
02:28:02,460 --> 02:28:04,440
I imagine that's scripted, right?

2668
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:07,960
I imagine that's scripted.

2669
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:11,140
I know this game says that there's nothing scripted in here.

2670
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:13,320
But there's some scripted things.

2671
02:28:18,490 --> 02:28:20,190
Especially for your first day.

2672
02:28:20,730 --> 02:28:21,350
Alright, let's see.

2673
02:28:21,350 --> 02:28:26,690
A couple adopting a child from overseas requests a doll that reflects the child's cultural heritage.

2674
02:28:26,910 --> 02:28:29,810
They hope it will help the child feel connected to their new home.

2675
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:36,790
Do we need to get the bucket?

2676
02:28:39,910 --> 02:28:41,710
Anyway, that's a hazard.

2677
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:45,990
I think this... Oh, nevermind.

2678
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:47,710
It's gone now.

2679
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:49,870
Anyway, blue eyes.

2680
02:28:51,350 --> 02:28:54,610
I like that these all have very descriptive reasons.

2681
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:58,730
They can't just request a doll for any whatever reason that they want.

2682
02:29:00,550 --> 02:29:03,570
They have to have a really...

2683
02:29:05,050 --> 02:29:05,630
Descriptive...

2684
02:29:05,630 --> 02:29:06,070
Everything.

2685
02:29:07,810 --> 02:29:08,850
Sweet freaks.

2686
02:29:11,410 --> 02:29:12,550
Sweet cheeks.

2687
02:29:13,510 --> 02:29:14,450
Yeah, I know.

2688
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:14,950
I heard you.

2689
02:29:18,510 --> 02:29:19,770
Sounds... Looks good to me.

2690
02:29:23,530 --> 02:29:25,310
Boo boo boo.

2691
02:29:26,490 --> 02:29:29,550
I wonder how many... Oh, wow!

2692
02:29:31,230 --> 02:29:32,190
We have a mutant?

2693
02:29:33,610 --> 02:29:34,950
We have a mutant?

2694
02:29:35,890 --> 02:29:39,330
Hey, someone would want this one.

2695
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:44,710
Literal third leg.

2696
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:46,650
It was an arm!

2697
02:29:46,650 --> 02:29:46,910
Oh!

2698
02:29:49,450 --> 02:29:52,930
This is the loading screen.

2699
02:29:53,470 --> 02:29:54,250
Or like the menu.

2700
02:29:55,210 --> 02:29:55,730
That's fun.

2701
02:29:56,050 --> 02:29:57,770
There's so many... I wonder how many like...

2702
02:29:58,270 --> 02:29:59,090
Oh, okay.

2703
02:29:59,270 --> 02:29:59,590
Nevermind.

2704
02:30:01,130 --> 02:30:02,910
Stop interrupting me, game!

2705
02:30:03,030 --> 02:30:04,650
I wonder how many more like...

2706
02:30:05,210 --> 02:30:09,510
Not anomalies, but like little occurrences that happen in the rooms.

2707
02:30:09,930 --> 02:30:12,170
There are... There seems to be a ton.

2708
02:30:13,290 --> 02:30:14,610
That we've gotten.

2709
02:30:14,610 --> 02:30:17,930
And of like a decent variety too, you know?

2710
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:22,940
Blue eyes!

2711
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:23,460
You're right!

2712
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,100
Thank you.

2713
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:27,480
I completely forgot about it, I'll be honest.

2714
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:28,960
Blue eyes!

2715
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:29,320
Okay.

2716
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:32,420
So, just blue eyes.

2717
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,160
Alright, nice.

2718
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:34,520
Yeah, a lot of variations.

2719
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:36,500
Lots and lots.

2720
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:38,060
Okay, let's go bring the box in.

2721
02:30:43,750 --> 02:30:45,410
I heard something laugh.

2722
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:48,430
I think that means there's...

2723
02:30:48,990 --> 02:30:51,150
I think that means there's a clown around.

2724
02:30:51,490 --> 02:30:52,210
Oh, there he is!

2725
02:30:58,650 --> 02:31:00,710
I wonder if it's the doll boxes talking.

2726
02:31:00,810 --> 02:31:01,370
I think so.

2727
02:31:01,450 --> 02:31:03,430
I think that's why it talks every time I...

2728
02:31:06,330 --> 02:31:08,930
Every time I leave...

2729
02:31:08,930 --> 02:31:12,330
Like this room, like every time I walk by, some of the dolls are talking to me.

2730
02:31:13,790 --> 02:31:14,430
Hmm.

2731
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:16,170
Okay.

2732
02:31:17,010 --> 02:31:18,250
Get in there.

2733
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:20,050
Box it up.

2734
02:31:20,690 --> 02:31:21,710
And pick up.

2735
02:31:22,030 --> 02:31:23,090
And off we go.

2736
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:33,490
Because now it's happening...

2737
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:36,850
Now it's happening literally every time I leave the door.

2738
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:38,070
Like I leave the room.

2739
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:41,890
So...

2740
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:45,860
It's very frequent.

2741
02:31:47,220 --> 02:31:48,600
Very, very frequent.

2742
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:49,720
Little whispers.

2743
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:51,460
The first time though really got me.

2744
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:54,380
First time though was so, so freaky.

2745
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:57,280
Okay.

2746
02:31:57,860 --> 02:31:59,720
A little angel.

2747
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:01,660
Do you have anything inside of you?

2748
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:03,540
No bugs?

2749
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:05,120
Okay.

2750
02:32:07,720 --> 02:32:09,280
Nothing on you either?

2751
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:10,880
That was very nice.

2752
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:11,960
That was very nice.

2753
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:15,260
This one also has blue eyes.

2754
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:19,360
No fingers?

2755
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,080
No.

2756
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:22,400
Yeah!

2757
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:24,820
You scared me!

2758
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:26,620
You scared me!

2759
02:32:26,740 --> 02:32:28,540
You made me think!

2760
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:30,520
You made me think!

2761
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:31,880
I messed up.

2762
02:32:31,960 --> 02:32:32,120
Okay.

2763
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:33,740
I do need to look at the fingers though.

2764
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:34,260
What was that?

2765
02:32:59,770 --> 02:33:01,490
I love the pumpkin outfit.

2766
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,210
Oh wait.

2767
02:33:03,290 --> 02:33:03,670
Fingies?

2768
02:33:05,070 --> 02:33:06,410
Maybe they said no fingers.

2769
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:08,910
As in like you didn't check the fingers.

2770
02:33:09,950 --> 02:33:11,130
Which that was true.

2771
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:12,290
I didn't check the fingers.

2772
02:33:13,390 --> 02:33:14,510
I love you.

2773
02:33:16,390 --> 02:33:17,690
Guys I have to go to the bathroom.

2774
02:33:19,250 --> 02:33:20,490
Has it been two hours?

2775
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:21,210
Yep it has.

2776
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:22,830
Oh my god.

2777
02:33:25,510 --> 02:33:26,550
This thing...

2778
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:28,150
It looked like a tiny head.

2779
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:32,230
Like a tiny head of a person.

2780
02:33:32,470 --> 02:33:33,630
Oh my god!

2781
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:37,330
Oh no, this guy is good.

2782
02:33:38,990 --> 02:33:39,390
Hi!

2783
02:33:42,610 --> 02:33:43,830
Mito-chan good morning!

2784
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:44,990
Good morning!

2785
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:48,150
Good morning Koyu-chan.

2786
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:55,840
Actually okay.

2787
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:57,760
I'm gonna be right back.

2788
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:00,700
Oh my god!

2789
02:34:00,820 --> 02:34:01,320
Oh my god!

2790
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:02,240
Sorry.

2791
02:34:03,220 --> 02:34:04,520
Paz don't do that!

2792
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:09,000
Oh my god she was...Oh my god she was hanging from my curtains.

2793
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:10,400
Okay I'll be right back.

2794
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:12,100
I gotta let her out too.

2795
02:34:17,070 --> 02:34:18,530
Dan thank you for the superchat.

2796
02:34:20,850 --> 02:34:22,070
Oh my gosh.

2797
02:37:09,550 --> 02:37:12,310
I don't have my emotional support cat anymore.

2798
02:37:13,690 --> 02:37:14,650
She left.

2799
02:37:16,050 --> 02:37:19,970
Oh yeah sorry for everybody who came in and I was going around.

2800
02:37:23,910 --> 02:37:25,290
Paz doko she left.

2801
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:30,250
Sorry I'm opening up a box of eyedrops that I got earlier.

2802
02:37:31,610 --> 02:37:33,450
I got new eyedrops.

2803
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:35,570
Welcome back.

2804
02:37:35,790 --> 02:37:36,170
Thank you.

2805
02:37:36,330 --> 02:37:37,030
Gone fashion.

2806
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:38,310
Except I forgot to put it up.

2807
02:37:38,970 --> 02:37:40,370
I wonder how long this game is.

2808
02:37:42,310 --> 02:37:43,290
Oh wait hold on a second.

2809
02:37:45,430 --> 02:37:46,590
I got jumpscared by Minto.

2810
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:47,510
Sorry.

2811
02:37:48,490 --> 02:37:49,210
Sorry, sorry.

2812
02:37:59,030 --> 02:38:01,210
I have something I need to do.

2813
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:02,370
I just gotta check the time.

2814
02:38:09,050 --> 02:38:10,250
Oh okay I have lots of time.

2815
02:38:10,970 --> 02:38:12,650
I wonder how much we have though.

2816
02:38:12,650 --> 02:38:13,450
It's not that long.

2817
02:38:13,510 --> 02:38:14,230
Maybe 30 minutes left.

2818
02:38:14,330 --> 02:38:14,990
Oh okay perfect.

2819
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:16,670
That's actually great.

2820
02:38:17,970 --> 02:38:19,950
Cause then I'm gonna go get some food.

2821
02:38:20,330 --> 02:38:21,470
I'm gonna possess somebody.

2822
02:38:21,990 --> 02:38:23,010
With a meal.

2823
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:28,710
Mentioned earlier it's a wild year for vtubers.

2824
02:38:28,930 --> 02:38:29,430
So I'm good bye.

2825
02:38:29,530 --> 02:38:32,330
I was curious what you think the state of vtubing is in.

2826
02:38:33,430 --> 02:38:35,750
I don't want to get into it so much.

2827
02:38:35,990 --> 02:38:38,770
I'll talk while I'm trying to open up my...

2828
02:38:38,770 --> 02:38:40,670
The eyedrops are so difficult to open.

2829
02:38:44,170 --> 02:38:45,110
I...

2830
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:49,990
I think...

2831
02:38:49,990 --> 02:38:53,650
I don't know how to say...

2832
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:55,570
State of the industry at best.

2833
02:38:56,090 --> 02:39:03,260
I think maybe...

2834
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:05,460
In terms of...

2835
02:39:07,410 --> 02:39:09,380
Why people might be leaving.

2836
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:12,610
Is that...

2837
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:17,840
No...

2838
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:20,300
People's priorities are changing.

2839
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:23,460
Or people are realizing...

2840
02:39:28,140 --> 02:39:32,460
That they can be successful with or without...

2841
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:34,640
You know, some sort of backing.

2842
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:37,040
I think the industry is changing.

2843
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:41,820
I was kind of talking with Matara about it last night too.

2844
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:43,700
How like...

2845
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:45,480
You know, sometimes when...

2846
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:47,240
Someone's oshi graduates.

2847
02:39:49,500 --> 02:39:51,260
And then they're just like...

2848
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:53,140
Oh man, I really just miss...

2849
02:39:53,140 --> 02:39:56,280
I just miss my oshi so much.

2850
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:58,180
And like...

2851
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:02,060
How do I explain this?

2852
02:40:02,140 --> 02:40:02,660
Oh gosh.

2853
02:40:02,740 --> 02:40:03,600
It's kind of hard to say.

2854
02:40:04,140 --> 02:40:05,220
But like...

2855
02:40:05,220 --> 02:40:08,080
For me, I miss my oshis too that have graduated.

2856
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:09,940
But I think...

2857
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:12,680
Because my oshis remind me of a simpler time.

2858
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:16,600
When like, you know...

2859
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:21,180
I was just getting into VTubing or something like that.

2860
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:25,340
So...

2861
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:26,300
Oh gosh, sorry.

2862
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:27,880
I was not prepared at all.

2863
02:40:27,940 --> 02:40:29,320
I don't even know why I commented.

2864
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:34,700
Let me get back to my editor.

2865
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:38,160
And then I'll make my formally public...

2866
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:40,800
My formal statement.

2867
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:46,140
Let me get back with my publisher, please.

2868
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:51,760
It is weird how things change.

2869
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,180
It's not...

2870
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:54,280
Sweet cheeks.

2871
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:56,220
It's not necessarily like a bad thing.

2872
02:40:56,300 --> 02:40:56,700
It's just...

2873
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:59,240
You know, sometimes things will change.

2874
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:00,000
And you'll be like...

2875
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,140
Oh, I love this change.

2876
02:41:01,740 --> 02:41:02,840
I think I mentioned like...

2877
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:04,160
Nope.

2878
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:05,980
Into the bucket.

2879
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:07,790
I think I mentioned how like...

2880
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:09,700
You know, some people...

2881
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:13,100
I compared it to like a band earlier.

2882
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:15,720
Sometimes a band will like change singers.

2883
02:41:17,300 --> 02:41:18,260
Not swingers.

2884
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:20,740
They'll change singers.

2885
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:24,820
You know, and sometimes people are like...

2886
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:26,080
Oh, it's still my favorite band.

2887
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:27,360
They still perform the same song.

2888
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:28,160
They still love it.

2889
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:30,040
But it's also different, you know.

2890
02:41:31,180 --> 02:41:32,920
Oh wait, this person I think is good.

2891
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:35,020
Oh wait, check their fingers.

2892
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:37,200
And their toes.

2893
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:38,900
34.

2894
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:39,840
We're good.

2895
02:41:44,730 --> 02:41:46,930
But for some people...

2896
02:41:46,930 --> 02:41:47,590
A change...

2897
02:41:47,590 --> 02:41:50,090
Like something that changes like that...

2898
02:41:50,090 --> 02:41:52,390
Do they talk?

2899
02:41:54,050 --> 02:41:55,570
Oh my god, they don't talk.

2900
02:41:56,930 --> 02:41:58,190
Some people like it.

2901
02:41:58,190 --> 02:41:58,930
Some people don't.

2902
02:41:59,150 --> 02:41:59,550
I don't know.

2903
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:17,130
Go home.

2904
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:19,610
Okay.

2905
02:42:20,690 --> 02:42:22,090
You don't have to tell me twice.

2906
02:42:22,850 --> 02:42:23,390
See ya.

2907
02:42:25,190 --> 02:42:26,170
Behind that door?

2908
02:42:27,030 --> 02:42:27,690
This one?

2909
02:42:31,690 --> 02:42:33,170
I think it said behind that door.

2910
02:42:34,510 --> 02:42:35,780
That's the bucket I left...

2911
02:42:36,130 --> 02:42:38,070
I spilled on the ground and didn't pick up.

2912
02:42:39,270 --> 02:42:42,550
Can't wait for your formal opinion on VTubing in the weekly Minto Memo.

2913
02:42:42,930 --> 02:42:43,430
Yeah.

2914
02:42:44,770 --> 02:42:45,370
Sorry.

2915
02:42:47,010 --> 02:42:47,610
I...

2916
02:42:48,310 --> 02:42:48,910
I...

2917
02:42:49,790 --> 02:42:51,390
Have many thoughts.

2918
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:53,470
It's just that I'm not very articulate.

2919
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:56,750
It's so cold.

2920
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:57,910
Is that what you said?

2921
02:42:58,170 --> 02:42:58,670
Oh no.

2922
02:42:59,270 --> 02:43:00,950
Give the babies some clothes.

2923
02:43:01,770 --> 02:43:03,030
The dolls are cold.

2924
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:15,710
My insight is still appreciated.

2925
02:43:16,070 --> 02:43:18,410
I appreciate you appreciating that.

2926
02:43:20,270 --> 02:43:21,570
Oh no, my...

2927
02:43:21,570 --> 02:43:22,110
Oh my gosh.

2928
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:24,590
Ah!

2929
02:43:26,190 --> 02:43:27,310
I would have...

2930
02:43:27,310 --> 02:43:29,170
Oh no, I wouldn't have had a thousand dollars.

2931
02:43:29,250 --> 02:43:30,570
But that was a lot.

2932
02:43:31,710 --> 02:43:32,590
That was good.

2933
02:43:35,910 --> 02:43:38,010
950 dollars for one day of work.

2934
02:43:39,270 --> 02:43:40,390
And we got all the notes.

2935
02:43:40,450 --> 02:43:41,130
Yeah, exactly.

2936
02:43:41,330 --> 02:43:41,850
That was good.

2937
02:43:42,770 --> 02:43:44,090
There's something different about today.

2938
02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:46,770
I can feel the factory even when I'm not there.

2939
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:48,770
It's like it knows I'm coming back.

2940
02:43:48,770 --> 02:43:50,210
Like it's been waiting for this.

2941
02:43:50,730 --> 02:43:51,530
The dolls...

2942
02:43:51,530 --> 02:43:52,310
The dolls.

2943
02:43:52,490 --> 02:43:52,910
Those eyes.

2944
02:43:52,910 --> 02:43:54,950
They linger in my mind.

2945
02:43:55,430 --> 02:43:55,770
Watching.

2946
02:43:55,970 --> 02:43:56,670
Always watching.

2947
02:43:57,230 --> 02:43:59,670
I don't know why, but it feels like they're waiting for me too.

2948
02:44:00,330 --> 02:44:03,530
I thought about not going back, but deep down I know I have no choice.

2949
02:44:04,090 --> 02:44:07,390
Something's waiting for me inside and I can't avoid it any longer.

2950
02:44:09,610 --> 02:44:12,770
Can we get your official stance on the geopolitical situation?

2951
02:44:14,450 --> 02:44:16,370
Of the world and benefits of quantum sci...

2952
02:44:16,370 --> 02:44:16,470
What?

2953
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:37,620
The baby dolls.

2954
02:44:41,150 --> 02:44:42,810
Run away.

2955
02:44:45,050 --> 02:44:46,190
Run away.

2956
02:44:47,750 --> 02:44:48,970
Are you scared yet?

2957
02:44:50,070 --> 02:44:54,470
You weren't always like this?

2958
02:44:56,090 --> 02:44:58,790
Time to play.

2959
02:44:58,790 --> 02:44:58,870
Okay.

2960
02:45:01,870 --> 02:45:04,790
Oh no, the locker room is...

2961
02:45:05,990 --> 02:45:06,970
Can you fix this?

2962
02:45:07,050 --> 02:45:07,810
I can fix you.

2963
02:45:07,950 --> 02:45:08,390
Don't worry.

2964
02:45:09,090 --> 02:45:09,870
Everything's locked?

2965
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:13,070
Don't let it touch you.

2966
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:18,750
He'll never be alone.

2967
02:45:18,870 --> 02:45:19,070
Alright.

2968
02:45:24,110 --> 02:45:26,390
Sir, I'm here for my shift.

2969
02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:30,130
I'm looking to make about a bajillion bucks today.

2970
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:36,160
Previous error.

2971
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:37,400
Coming back here?

2972
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:40,920
What's this say?

2973
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:44,340
Does anybody read webdings?

2974
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:45,560
Wingdings?

2975
02:45:46,580 --> 02:45:47,190
Ding-dongs.

2976
02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:53,300
I got my emotional support pet.

2977
02:45:55,060 --> 02:45:56,520
Oh my god!

2978
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:01,080
We're still working.

2979
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:02,540
We're kind of crazy.

2980
02:46:05,580 --> 02:46:06,920
It says you're dead.

2981
02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:07,460
Wait, where?

2982
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:10,240
Where does it say that?

2983
02:46:19,950 --> 02:46:21,950
Headless doll, but I can't repair it.

2984
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:24,290
I'll just... Oh wait, what's this say?

2985
02:46:25,130 --> 02:46:26,090
Look careful.

2986
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:26,810
All body.

2987
02:46:26,910 --> 02:46:27,550
Fingers, fingers.

2988
02:46:28,170 --> 02:46:28,930
Fingers, fingers.

2989
02:46:29,530 --> 02:46:31,250
Factory is watching move.

2990
02:46:36,490 --> 02:46:37,670
The webdings.

2991
02:46:37,810 --> 02:46:38,790
Oh no way, really?

2992
02:46:40,330 --> 02:46:40,930
Freaky!

2993
02:46:41,350 --> 02:46:42,690
I can't pick this up.

2994
02:46:43,050 --> 02:46:44,190
Or it doesn't budge.

2995
02:46:53,350 --> 02:46:55,470
Okay, I'm just doing my job.

2996
02:46:56,050 --> 02:46:56,630
Kind of.

2997
02:46:57,730 --> 02:46:59,030
Can't really do anything.

2998
02:46:59,270 --> 02:47:00,130
I'll just approve it.

2999
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:05,920
Yellow light?

3000
02:47:12,750 --> 02:47:14,250
Oh, that's a cactus.

3001
02:47:15,550 --> 02:47:17,490
I love that we're still picking these up.

3002
02:47:21,210 --> 02:47:24,210
This one is definitely not good, but I can't...

3003
02:47:24,210 --> 02:47:26,710
Yeah, I guess we just have to approve all of them.

3004
02:47:27,810 --> 02:47:29,670
I'm not getting paid today, am I?

3005
02:47:30,510 --> 02:47:31,950
Can I make negative money?

3006
02:47:34,490 --> 02:47:35,730
That was very nice.

3007
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:37,850
What did you say?

3008
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:38,770
That was very nice.

3009
02:47:41,330 --> 02:47:42,210
You can find out.

3010
02:47:43,090 --> 02:47:44,870
Well, technically it's like working though.

3011
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:56,410
If you had to say cheesy one quote for a video to promote yourself along the lines of...

3012
02:47:57,430 --> 02:47:58,330
What a night... Wait.

3013
02:48:02,410 --> 02:48:03,010
Wait.

3014
02:48:18,390 --> 02:48:20,950
The cave lion said nothing would jump out at us!

3015
02:48:22,110 --> 02:48:22,690
Oh my god.

3016
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:29,110
I'll get back to you, super chat.

3017
02:48:30,610 --> 02:48:33,510
I'm kind of going through it, if you couldn't tell.

3018
02:48:34,530 --> 02:48:36,210
Now it teaches me how to crouch.

3019
02:48:37,770 --> 02:48:40,410
Oh my gosh, it's going to tell us to sprint later too, isn't it?

3020
02:48:47,690 --> 02:48:48,430
Where do I go?

3021
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:50,410
I guess forward?

3022
02:48:51,350 --> 02:48:51,830
March?

3023
02:48:52,590 --> 02:48:53,330
That's a wall.

3024
02:48:55,690 --> 02:48:59,170
It says do not let it... They keep saying don't let it touch you.

3025
02:48:59,230 --> 02:49:00,610
Is there like something around in here?

3026
02:49:02,970 --> 02:49:05,270
Ok, I'm just... I'm hugging the wall.

3027
02:49:05,410 --> 02:49:06,050
Oh, here we go.

3028
02:49:10,510 --> 02:49:11,470
Oh boy.

3029
02:49:14,150 --> 02:49:15,250
Can we get through this?

3030
02:49:18,770 --> 02:49:21,750
Ok, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

3031
02:49:24,110 --> 02:49:25,050
Walk, walk, walk, walk.

3032
02:49:25,050 --> 02:49:26,630
I wish I could run, but I can't.

3033
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:27,990
Oh my gosh.

3034
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:31,070
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

3035
02:49:32,590 --> 02:49:34,650
Maybe this is what they meant, don't let it touch you.

3036
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:39,130
Oh gosh.

3037
02:49:39,450 --> 02:49:40,230
Ok, we made it.

3038
02:49:40,810 --> 02:49:41,410
We made it.

3039
02:49:44,510 --> 02:49:45,450
Let's turn on the light.

3040
02:49:47,690 --> 02:49:49,350
I'm just burning all the babies.

3041
02:49:55,530 --> 02:49:56,770
Goodbye little babies.

3042
02:50:00,590 --> 02:50:01,110
Nice.

3043
02:50:03,310 --> 02:50:03,990
What's over here?

3044
02:50:05,530 --> 02:50:05,970
Nothing.

3045
02:50:07,990 --> 02:50:10,370
Do I turn off the fire?

3046
02:50:12,230 --> 02:50:13,270
Plastic fumes.

3047
02:50:13,410 --> 02:50:14,090
Oh yeah, baby.

3048
02:50:14,350 --> 02:50:15,050
Smells so good.

3049
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:16,110
Oh, turn off?

3050
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:16,390
Nice.

3051
02:50:34,430 --> 02:50:37,290
Oh, requires a valve.

3052
02:50:37,950 --> 02:50:39,130
Oh no.

3053
02:50:40,730 --> 02:50:42,530
Ok, understandable.

3054
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:47,410
Maybe it's around here.

3055
02:51:01,730 --> 02:51:04,010
Gabe, Gabe, where are you?

3056
02:51:04,870 --> 02:51:05,370
Gabe.

3057
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:05,690
Gabe.

3058
02:51:07,930 --> 02:51:11,590
I was showing Matara some Mega64 videos.

3059
02:51:12,410 --> 02:51:14,450
Like the one with Gabe Newell in it.

3060
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:18,250
Oh, there it is.

3061
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:19,510
I found it.

3062
02:51:26,060 --> 02:51:27,060
Brings me back.

3063
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:27,740
I know, right?

3064
02:51:28,400 --> 02:51:33,340
It was fun watching some of the old ones too.

3065
02:51:33,820 --> 02:51:35,380
That I hadn't seen in a while.

3066
02:51:37,700 --> 02:51:38,420
Oh shoot.

3067
02:51:38,620 --> 02:51:38,760
Ok.

3068
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:42,980
Oh they move but we don't.

3069
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:44,040
Ok, that's fine.

3070
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:50,960
Ok!

3071
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:53,740
I knew it.

3072
02:51:53,900 --> 02:51:54,780
You tricked me.

3073
02:51:59,940 --> 02:52:01,520
What do you mean by that?

3074
02:52:04,020 --> 02:52:04,300
What?

3075
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:08,880
What the?

3076
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:11,840
I like how my task is to perform the quality checks.

3077
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:20,090
Ok, you kind of suck.

3078
02:52:23,310 --> 02:52:24,450
Oh, I hear crying.

3079
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:29,050
I think we got betrayed.

3080
02:52:30,690 --> 02:52:31,090
Anyway.

3081
02:52:33,330 --> 02:52:34,110
I can't see anything.

3082
02:52:34,270 --> 02:52:34,910
Oh, there we go.

3083
02:52:39,020 --> 02:52:42,840
Oh my gosh, it's parkour jail.

3084
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:46,220
No!

3085
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:47,940
Sad baby!

3086
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:49,260
No!

3087
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:51,260
Don't be so sad baby!

3088
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:55,760
You are no longer alone.

3089
02:52:55,940 --> 02:52:57,740
Oh, sad babies!

3090
02:53:09,610 --> 02:53:11,630
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

3091
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:13,030
Is this what it made for me?

3092
02:53:18,230 --> 02:53:19,170
Oh my god.

3093
02:53:19,290 --> 02:53:20,090
Oh my god!

3094
02:53:24,470 --> 02:53:25,830
This is crazy.

3095
02:53:29,730 --> 02:53:32,050
At least put your feet down.

3096
02:53:33,250 --> 02:53:34,130
Poor guy.

3097
02:53:34,570 --> 02:53:35,310
These guys are so sad.

3098
02:53:35,330 --> 02:53:35,890
Oh my god!

3099
02:53:35,950 --> 02:53:37,090
You guys get to stay together.

3100
02:53:37,890 --> 02:53:40,370
And they are... I don't know what they are doing.

3101
02:53:43,250 --> 02:53:46,950
Mega64 Deus Ex episode had a better story than the game.

3102
02:53:54,320 --> 02:53:55,580
What did you say?

3103
02:53:55,660 --> 02:53:56,100
Run away?

3104
02:53:57,140 --> 02:53:57,740
I'm trying.

3105
02:53:59,080 --> 02:54:00,660
I'm working on it I think.

3106
02:54:00,760 --> 02:54:01,900
Ok, don't fall maybe.

3107
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:04,760
Look at all these sad, sad little babies.

3108
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:06,740
Oh my god!

3109
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:07,100
No!

3110
02:54:07,180 --> 02:54:08,300
Don't do it baby!

3111
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:11,720
The yapping baby.

3112
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:16,980
I shouldn't be laughing.

3113
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:17,880
They are all prisoners.

3114
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:22,960
But I can't.

3115
02:54:23,540 --> 02:54:25,300
Their little positions... Oh my goodness.

3116
02:54:25,560 --> 02:54:26,860
Their positions are so funny.

3117
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:28,960
The way they are just standing around.

3118
02:54:29,900 --> 02:54:30,700
So funny.

3119
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:38,000
Hey what?

3120
02:54:38,380 --> 02:54:39,180
Hey is for horses.

3121
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:44,820
This guy is just like...

3122
02:54:49,910 --> 02:54:52,190
He is crying and I can't stop laughing.

3123
02:54:57,530 --> 02:54:58,490
Side eye baby.

3124
02:54:59,330 --> 02:55:00,730
Toy story really went off the rails.

3125
02:55:00,810 --> 02:55:04,810
This is what Sid would have created if he had the means and all.

3126
02:55:06,490 --> 02:55:08,170
This is Sid's... Oh my god!

3127
02:55:09,290 --> 02:55:10,970
He is actually trying to get through there.

3128
02:55:11,050 --> 02:55:11,930
Here, take my hand baby.

3129
02:55:12,730 --> 02:55:13,870
You have your big old forehead.

3130
02:55:17,850 --> 02:55:19,330
You can't stupid.

3131
02:55:19,970 --> 02:55:22,010
You can't grab me with your little baby hands.

3132
02:55:22,270 --> 02:55:24,770
Your butt is too big to fit through.

3133
02:55:26,570 --> 02:55:30,130
There is just something really funny about the guys that are just standing there.

3134
02:55:32,370 --> 02:55:35,130
This is what Alice in Toho has to deal with, right?

3135
02:55:36,430 --> 02:55:37,750
Can I grab it?

3136
02:55:37,890 --> 02:55:38,350
Oh man.

3137
02:55:38,510 --> 02:55:38,930
Come on.

3138
02:55:40,350 --> 02:55:40,850
Oh there we go.

3139
02:55:40,910 --> 02:55:41,130
Nice.

3140
02:55:43,350 --> 02:55:45,430
That stuffed doll in his room.

3141
02:55:45,830 --> 02:55:47,110
I'm somehow attached to it.

3142
02:55:47,370 --> 02:55:48,310
Can't say no to him.

3143
02:55:48,690 --> 02:55:51,770
If I would destroy it, I will be free.

3144
02:55:58,910 --> 02:56:00,750
Back to back baby.

3145
02:56:02,010 --> 02:56:03,270
I know I just sent a super through.

3146
02:56:03,430 --> 02:56:05,650
I just realized they can fit through those bars.

3147
02:56:05,870 --> 02:56:06,990
They are small enough to fit.

3148
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:07,710
They can just leave.

3149
02:56:07,810 --> 02:56:08,450
Not that guy.

3150
02:56:08,530 --> 02:56:09,190
He was trying.

3151
02:56:09,270 --> 02:56:09,830
Look at him.

3152
02:56:11,130 --> 02:56:12,190
He was trying.

3153
02:56:14,570 --> 02:56:16,030
Oh my god!

3154
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:32,520
Oh my

3155
02:56:36,860 --> 02:56:37,360
baby.

3156
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:40,000
I'm obsessed with seeing what each baby is doing now.

3157
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:42,420
Kill?

3158
02:56:42,660 --> 02:56:43,540
Is that what she just said?

3159
02:56:44,260 --> 02:56:44,760
Kill.

3160
02:56:45,560 --> 02:56:47,300
Oh my god!

3161
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:49,400
This looks like a fresh baby.

3162
02:56:50,680 --> 02:56:51,880
Can't say that.

3163
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:53,760
What do you say?

3164
02:56:57,720 --> 02:56:59,240
Please help me.

3165
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:00,500
Oh sorry baby.

3166
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:06,340
Oh they are so dramatic.

3167
02:57:07,480 --> 02:57:08,640
It's so funny.

3168
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:12,300
Alright.

3169
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:12,720
Alright.

3170
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:14,220
We drop down again over here.

3171
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:20,440
Alright.

3172
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:24,000
Now we go around through there.

3173
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:25,480
Oh my god.

3174
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:26,740
These are the freak babies.

3175
02:57:27,360 --> 02:57:28,780
These are the real freaks here.

3176
02:57:31,840 --> 02:57:34,360
This guy is really... Oh my god.

3177
02:57:34,460 --> 02:57:35,780
They are all going through it.

3178
02:57:36,300 --> 02:57:37,180
Dance baby!

3179
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:37,960
Dance!

3180
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:41,240
Everyone is so mean to me.

3181
02:57:41,340 --> 02:57:42,340
Baby is MVP.

3182
02:57:45,740 --> 02:57:46,940
Make it stop.

3183
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:52,660
Why do I feel like I'm gonna get chased though?

3184
02:57:52,660 --> 02:57:54,860
Do you think there is anything in these rooms?

3185
02:57:54,980 --> 02:57:55,640
Like another note?

3186
02:57:57,400 --> 02:57:58,700
I guess I'll check it out.

3187
02:57:59,060 --> 02:57:59,780
Just in case.

3188
02:58:00,860 --> 02:58:02,700
Kind of invasion of the baby's privacy.

3189
02:58:07,410 --> 02:58:09,450
You can hear the gentle...

3190
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:12,210
The gentle sound of his little baby head...

3191
02:58:12,870 --> 02:58:14,050
Against the rails.

3192
02:58:14,750 --> 02:58:15,910
Look at this guy up here.

3193
02:58:16,010 --> 02:58:16,930
What's going on?

3194
02:58:19,330 --> 02:58:20,590
No, I'm baby.

3195
02:58:20,590 --> 02:58:20,710
I'm baby.

3196
02:58:23,150 --> 02:58:25,190
I want what that baby has.

3197
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:29,790
He's not even inside his jail cell.

3198
02:58:29,890 --> 02:58:30,890
Just leave baby.

3199
02:58:32,430 --> 02:58:34,470
Get out little baby while you can.

3200
02:58:35,630 --> 02:58:38,610
Let's leave through the red scary passage.

3201
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:44,630
They look like FNAF animatronics sometimes.

3202
02:58:46,990 --> 02:58:47,630
FNAF.

3203
02:58:48,470 --> 02:58:49,330
Oh my gosh.

3204
02:58:49,830 --> 02:58:52,090
Wow, I almost fell through.

3205
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:57,520
Baby.

3206
02:58:57,880 --> 02:58:58,660
Alright, here we go.

3207
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:02,240
Oh my god.

3208
02:59:02,460 --> 02:59:02,720
More?

3209
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:11,840
Is the money that he pays you worth it?

3210
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:13,040
Oh my god.

3211
02:59:15,850 --> 02:59:17,010
I don't know.

3212
02:59:22,270 --> 02:59:23,590
Lay down and cry?

3213
02:59:23,730 --> 02:59:24,270
Is that what you said?

3214
02:59:26,270 --> 02:59:27,990
Oh my god, there's so many babies.

3215
02:59:28,270 --> 02:59:29,650
Now he's ran out of room.

3216
02:59:29,850 --> 02:59:30,870
They're shoving him in.

3217
02:59:32,090 --> 02:59:34,450
Oh my god, there's so many babies.

3218
02:59:39,770 --> 02:59:41,330
They sound kind of slay.

3219
02:59:41,550 --> 02:59:41,930
Oh god.

3220
02:59:42,530 --> 02:59:43,690
Okay, run, run, run.

3221
02:59:45,910 --> 02:59:46,710
Oh my god.

3222
02:59:47,550 --> 02:59:48,290
Oh shoot.

3223
02:59:51,390 --> 02:59:52,390
I can make it!

3224
02:59:52,490 --> 02:59:52,890
I can make it!

3225
02:59:52,910 --> 02:59:53,590
I can make it!

3226
02:59:55,990 --> 02:59:56,690
I think.

3227
03:00:07,530 --> 03:00:07,970
Oh!

3228
03:00:08,190 --> 03:00:09,350
I'm in my own jail cell.

3229
03:00:25,100 --> 03:00:25,540
Reset.

3230
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:26,900
Oh my god, the gas!

3231
03:00:27,460 --> 03:00:29,340
Oh my god, there's gas everywhere.

3232
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:31,360
I'm in baby jail.

3233
03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:34,140
I'm a baby!

3234
03:00:42,220 --> 03:00:43,940
I'm a dapper baby though.

3235
03:00:51,260 --> 03:00:52,840
I hear someone walking.

3236
03:00:54,140 --> 03:00:55,720
I'm a dapper baby though.

3237
03:00:55,720 --> 03:00:58,100
Time to turn Minto into a marketable doll.

3238
03:00:58,580 --> 03:00:59,880
I got ending A.

3239
03:01:00,260 --> 03:01:01,460
Doll's life.

3240
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:05,100
Wow!

3241
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:10,700
Ending 1 of 2 is what it says in the corner now.

3242
03:01:11,660 --> 03:01:14,080
So I wonder what to do to get ending 2.

3243
03:01:15,700 --> 03:01:16,580
Mint baby.

3244
03:01:16,960 --> 03:01:18,000
That was so fun.

3245
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:21,660
What happens if I click continue?

3246
03:01:24,700 --> 03:01:26,080
Where does it leave me off?

3247
03:01:27,800 --> 03:01:28,400
Imagine...

3248
03:01:29,360 --> 03:01:31,080
I imagine it...

3249
03:01:35,800 --> 03:01:36,400
will...

3250
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:38,220
Let's just try it out.

3251
03:01:38,300 --> 03:01:39,080
I imagine...

3252
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:43,080
it leads... lets me continue...

3253
03:01:48,610 --> 03:01:49,210
Oh?

3254
03:01:50,250 --> 03:01:51,750
I can't get it now.

3255
03:01:51,990 --> 03:01:52,810
I don't think so.

3256
03:01:53,350 --> 03:01:58,890
I was going to say I imagine it, but I think it just lets you continue at the day you were at.

3257
03:01:59,190 --> 03:02:00,190
Gotta restart I think.

3258
03:02:01,650 --> 03:02:02,510
That's okay then.

3259
03:02:03,630 --> 03:02:04,610
This was still such a...

3260
03:02:05,590 --> 03:02:06,790
Funny little game.

3261
03:02:08,490 --> 03:02:10,310
There was a prerequisite on an earlier day.

3262
03:02:11,390 --> 03:02:14,830
Yeah, I guess don't listen to K or I guess you throw them away or something.

3263
03:02:15,970 --> 03:02:19,410
It's my birthday today so I figured I'd celebrate by sending my first superchat to you.

3264
03:02:19,510 --> 03:02:20,490
Oh my gosh, Somari!

3265
03:02:20,630 --> 03:02:21,270
Thank you!

3266
03:02:22,230 --> 03:02:23,670
That's a silly way to celebrate.

3267
03:02:23,790 --> 03:02:25,410
You should have spent it on yourself!

3268
03:02:25,950 --> 03:02:27,510
And I of course will sing you happy birthday!

3269
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:32,510
Happy birthday to you.

3270
03:02:32,930 --> 03:02:35,810
Happy birthday to you.

3271
03:02:36,210 --> 03:02:39,250
Happy birthday dear Somari.

3272
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:45,090
Happy birthday to you.

3273
03:02:46,850 --> 03:02:47,710
Happy birthday!

3274
03:02:47,710 --> 03:02:47,890
Yay!

3275
03:02:50,310 --> 03:02:53,410
I saw someone say that you have to get something to open up that boarded door.

3276
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:55,370
Which makes sense.

3277
03:02:57,270 --> 03:02:58,990
Makes sense, makes sense, makes sense.

3278
03:02:59,390 --> 03:03:00,670
That key makes it if I get it.

3279
03:03:01,190 --> 03:03:03,750
You need to get a particular note past that door.

3280
03:03:05,530 --> 03:03:06,450
That opens it.

3281
03:03:06,550 --> 03:03:07,610
Get a crowbar.

3282
03:03:08,330 --> 03:03:09,190
For a thousand.

3283
03:03:11,850 --> 03:03:13,130
Fun, fun, fun.

3284
03:03:14,590 --> 03:03:17,770
Well, maybe if you guys want to see the other ending.

3285
03:03:18,570 --> 03:03:21,510
Maybe another Vtuber or streamer will have done it.

3286
03:03:22,070 --> 03:03:24,230
Or you can play it yourself.

3287
03:03:24,990 --> 03:03:25,510
Very cool.

3288
03:03:27,510 --> 03:03:31,970
You find to find a voucher apparently which lets you get an item.

3289
03:03:32,330 --> 03:03:33,310
That's cool!

3290
03:03:33,790 --> 03:03:34,450
That's fun.

3291
03:03:35,190 --> 03:03:38,030
So I guess it does reward you for exploring.

3292
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:43,270
I'm assuming it lets you into the room with the big bash man.

3293
03:03:43,990 --> 03:03:44,890
Wait, sorry.

3294
03:03:45,030 --> 03:03:46,330
The big boss man.

3295
03:03:46,670 --> 03:03:48,150
I was trying to say...

3296
03:03:48,850 --> 03:03:50,810
I was going to say the bad boss.

3297
03:03:51,690 --> 03:03:55,490
Big boss man's room and then you get the doll and you destroy it.

3298
03:03:55,730 --> 03:03:56,870
The bash man.

3299
03:04:03,780 --> 03:04:04,900
But this was fun.

3300
03:04:05,080 --> 03:04:05,840
It was way...

3301
03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:06,740
It wasn't...

3302
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:11,020
I honestly went in with zero expectations but it was cute.

3303
03:04:11,480 --> 03:04:12,140
It was fun.

3304
03:04:13,540 --> 03:04:16,680
And I liked how they kept adding on to the dolls.

3305
03:04:17,380 --> 03:04:20,000
I think maybe it was a little too easy.

3306
03:04:20,340 --> 03:04:24,400
I think I was kind of too good at the game.

3307
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:27,200
I think I was kind of too good at the game.

3308
03:04:28,580 --> 03:04:31,380
The only times I messed up was when I was on autopilot.

3309
03:04:33,800 --> 03:04:36,380
I was about to say good morning but then I saw it was 4pm.

3310
03:04:37,180 --> 03:04:38,040
So good evening, Minto.

3311
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:39,780
Good evening, king.

3312
03:04:41,400 --> 03:04:41,840
MintoGamer.

3313
03:04:42,300 --> 03:04:42,900
We're gaming.

3314
03:04:44,520 --> 03:04:45,620
We made lots of money.

3315
03:04:45,920 --> 03:04:48,380
I love that one doll that was like, was the money worth it?

3316
03:04:50,060 --> 03:04:50,500
Yeah.

3317
03:04:52,280 --> 03:04:52,880
I don't know.

3318
03:04:53,020 --> 03:04:53,260
Maybe.

3319
03:04:53,800 --> 03:04:54,200
Whatever.

3320
03:04:54,800 --> 03:04:55,240
Who cares.

3321
03:04:57,580 --> 03:04:58,600
Thanks for the stream.

3322
03:04:58,680 --> 03:05:04,260
Did you know in two weeks or today there will be the Phantom Thief concert at the Tabernacle in Atlanta, Georgia.

3323
03:05:04,740 --> 03:05:05,260
Yes!

3324
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:08,900
Atlanta, Georgia.

3325
03:05:10,140 --> 03:05:10,660
Tabernacle.

3326
03:05:11,140 --> 03:05:15,360
Same weekend as Anime Weekend Atlanta but not affiliated with the convention.

3327
03:05:15,560 --> 03:05:23,060
But just the same weekend so if you're like, oh I can't travel for just one event, you can travel for multiple events because there's also the Hololive concert.

3328
03:05:23,060 --> 03:05:27,560
Which is not conflicting with our concert.

3329
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:28,920
Two weeks.

3330
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:30,660
Two weeks!

3331
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:32,020
Gosh.

3332
03:05:33,460 --> 03:05:35,000
There's still so much for me to do.

3333
03:05:36,100 --> 03:05:36,880
Oh god.

3334
03:05:37,080 --> 03:05:37,860
I'm scared.

3335
03:05:38,120 --> 03:05:38,700
I'm nervous.

3336
03:05:39,100 --> 03:05:40,420
I'm so nervous.

3337
03:05:42,480 --> 03:05:43,400
Oh gosh.

3338
03:05:44,660 --> 03:05:45,580
Silly quote time.

3339
03:05:45,720 --> 03:05:46,220
Oh yeah!

3340
03:05:46,380 --> 03:05:46,920
Silly quote.

3341
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:54,920
If I had to think of a silly quote to describe me...

3342
03:05:55,940 --> 03:05:56,340
Oh!

3343
03:05:56,700 --> 03:05:58,180
I'm just here for the boobs.

3344
03:05:59,900 --> 03:06:01,500
Get it?

3345
03:06:01,960 --> 03:06:04,720
Like boo but boobs.

3346
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:08,300
That would be my silly quote.

3347
03:06:09,460 --> 03:06:10,120
Sweet cheeks.

3348
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:16,300
I can recommend a plane DLC.

3349
03:06:16,900 --> 03:06:18,820
F-15 SMTD.

3350
03:06:19,700 --> 03:06:23,060
Since I was playing my Oshi... wait.

3351
03:06:23,580 --> 03:06:24,660
My plane is my Oshi too.

3352
03:06:24,740 --> 03:06:25,900
I want to see you fly it one day.

3353
03:06:26,720 --> 03:06:28,180
Yeah I got all the DLC.

3354
03:06:28,480 --> 03:06:29,900
I got like the Top Gun DLC.

3355
03:06:32,020 --> 03:06:33,720
Which I actually didn't have before.

3356
03:06:34,460 --> 03:06:38,040
So now I have it and I just re-bought the game.

3357
03:06:40,780 --> 03:06:41,740
Oh gosh.

3358
03:06:43,660 --> 03:06:44,860
Honestly, aren't we all?

3359
03:06:47,180 --> 03:06:47,660
Boob.

3360
03:06:47,660 --> 03:06:48,940
Boob, boob, boob.

3361
03:06:50,760 --> 03:06:51,820
Well guys, this was fun.

3362
03:06:52,200 --> 03:06:54,280
Thanks for joining me for Dollmare.

3363
03:06:57,900 --> 03:06:59,340
The dolls were so funny.

3364
03:06:59,540 --> 03:07:02,640
Oh my gosh, I can't get over how dramatic they were in their little jail cells.

3365
03:07:03,060 --> 03:07:04,520
I want to be the most dramatic.

3366
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:06,240
What should we do?

3367
03:07:06,480 --> 03:07:08,300
We just got turned into a doll.

3368
03:07:08,720 --> 03:07:13,120
What should we do to make our doll so dramatic?

3369
03:07:13,560 --> 03:07:16,280
Like suffering.

3370
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:19,720
I like the ones that were kind of just facing the corners.

3371
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:26,320
Somewhere where they had their hands up in the air.

3372
03:07:26,620 --> 03:07:28,060
Oh god, why?

3373
03:07:28,120 --> 03:07:28,720
Why me?

3374
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:32,400
I bought all the DLC because I love the game a lot.

3375
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:35,480
Walking on the ceiling?

3376
03:07:39,810 --> 03:07:41,950
I like the ones with the black light smudges on them.

3377
03:07:42,170 --> 03:07:42,930
It's kind of freaky.

3378
03:07:43,510 --> 03:07:44,390
It's kind of freaky.

3379
03:07:44,530 --> 03:07:46,790
Hold your chains out like the Ghost of Christmas Past.

3380
03:07:46,870 --> 03:07:47,690
Oh that's good.

3381
03:07:48,290 --> 03:07:49,070
That's good.

3382
03:07:54,230 --> 03:07:56,830
Make your doll constantly poop and spit.

3383
03:08:00,510 --> 03:08:02,070
I don't want that.

3384
03:08:02,070 --> 03:08:03,550
A doll.

3385
03:08:04,050 --> 03:08:05,210
I had a doll like that.

3386
03:08:05,550 --> 03:08:08,870
Don't forget the event Horizon Beat Idol Festival at AWA before the concert.

3387
03:08:08,970 --> 03:08:10,750
Oh yeah, I will also be in that.

3388
03:08:12,570 --> 03:08:15,110
I will also be in that right before the concert.

3389
03:08:15,610 --> 03:08:16,870
Lots of stuff going around.

3390
03:08:18,250 --> 03:08:19,250
Lots of stuff.

3391
03:08:20,370 --> 03:08:21,290
Stinky doll.

3392
03:08:21,770 --> 03:08:22,990
360 head spinning.

3393
03:08:23,870 --> 03:08:25,870
I want something that's like... I don't know.

3394
03:08:27,250 --> 03:08:28,730
Something that's just so like...

3395
03:08:28,730 --> 03:08:30,450
Oh, woe is me.

3396
03:08:30,710 --> 03:08:32,090
Oh, I know what I want.

3397
03:08:32,170 --> 03:08:32,910
I know what I want.

3398
03:08:33,130 --> 03:08:34,790
I want in my jail cell.

3399
03:08:35,090 --> 03:08:36,730
You know those like medieval...

3400
03:08:37,750 --> 03:08:40,230
I guess it's considered a torture device.

3401
03:08:40,470 --> 03:08:42,730
But it's the one where you like stick your head through.

3402
03:08:43,130 --> 03:08:45,730
And then you have your wrists through and they're like shackled.

3403
03:08:46,230 --> 03:08:47,730
And you just like...

3404
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:51,870
That one where they put you out in town square.

3405
03:08:52,510 --> 03:08:53,410
The stalks.

3406
03:08:53,670 --> 03:08:54,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3407
03:08:54,750 --> 03:08:57,250
I want my doll to be in the stalks.

3408
03:08:59,850 --> 03:09:04,130
And then I'm just in my jail cell like...

3409
03:09:04,130 --> 03:09:06,010
I'm in the stalks.

3410
03:09:06,370 --> 03:09:07,370
It's so dramatic.

3411
03:09:09,230 --> 03:09:12,590
Oh, the fetus and doll in Rita's this week got me thinking of Death Stranding.

3412
03:09:13,310 --> 03:09:16,150
Would enjoy watching you stumble into bosses in that game.

3413
03:09:17,670 --> 03:09:19,610
I have been thinking about it recently.

3414
03:09:21,090 --> 03:09:23,730
Maybe I will give a...

3415
03:09:26,670 --> 03:09:27,110
A...

3416
03:09:27,630 --> 03:09:28,410
Sorry, I was drawing.

3417
03:09:28,630 --> 03:09:29,550
A full shot.

3418
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:32,570
Because I did like playing it before.

3419
03:09:32,690 --> 03:09:35,050
I played it before a little bit, but I never finished it.

3420
03:09:35,090 --> 03:09:38,050
I was like, I'll finish it off stream, but...

3421
03:09:38,050 --> 03:09:40,730
Finishing games off stream is difficult because...

3422
03:09:42,150 --> 03:09:44,770
You know, some games have become work for me, right?

3423
03:09:44,950 --> 03:09:48,830
So if I'm streaming or if I'm playing a game, I'm just like...

3424
03:09:48,830 --> 03:09:50,590
Sometimes feeling like it's work.

3425
03:09:53,490 --> 03:09:54,010
So...

3426
03:09:55,250 --> 03:09:57,590
Sometimes it's just like...

3427
03:10:00,370 --> 03:10:02,010
Makes playing games for fun hard.

3428
03:10:02,170 --> 03:10:06,530
I mean, that's quite literally a first world problem.

3429
03:10:06,690 --> 03:10:08,150
It's like the...

3430
03:10:09,090 --> 03:10:10,310
Oh, woe is me.

3431
03:10:10,710 --> 03:10:12,050
Oh, woe is me.

3432
03:10:12,170 --> 03:10:14,150
I play games all day, so...

3433
03:10:15,130 --> 03:10:19,070
When I want to play games for fun, it's just not fun anymore.

3434
03:10:19,490 --> 03:10:21,010
Oh, woe is me.

3435
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:23,430
But...

3436
03:10:28,250 --> 03:10:29,790
I'm gonna look it up.

3437
03:10:30,170 --> 03:10:31,890
Make sure you know what I'm talking about.

3438
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:38,000
Yes!

3439
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:39,280
The pillory.

3440
03:10:39,900 --> 03:10:43,180
Yes, yes, a wooden or metal frame with holes for the hands and head.

3441
03:10:43,960 --> 03:10:44,920
Public punishment.

3442
03:10:46,760 --> 03:10:51,140
Have you ever accidentally commented on a game to chat when playing alone?

3443
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:53,900
I don't think so.

3444
03:10:53,900 --> 03:10:55,900
But I have like...

3445
03:10:56,720 --> 03:10:58,140
Reacted and been like...

3446
03:10:59,540 --> 03:11:02,300
There was something that...

3447
03:11:02,300 --> 03:11:03,660
Happened last night.

3448
03:11:04,480 --> 03:11:05,900
That I said...

3449
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:07,900
And Matara...

3450
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:10,700
I got a good reaction out of Matara.

3451
03:11:10,920 --> 03:11:12,860
And I was like, I'm not even entertaining anybody.

3452
03:11:13,040 --> 03:11:13,840
I just...

3453
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:16,640
I just act like that.

3454
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:20,280
I can't remember.

3455
03:11:23,900 --> 03:11:25,160
It was silliness though.

3456
03:11:28,800 --> 03:11:31,780
Stream Death Stranding with a guest on, though it would be hard to schedule.

3457
03:11:31,940 --> 03:11:32,320
True.

3458
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:37,180
Yeah, just freaky like that.

3459
03:11:37,260 --> 03:11:37,720
So true.

3460
03:11:39,160 --> 03:11:41,640
Is the postcard from the tweet the same art you and Doki signed?

3461
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:41,960
Yeah!

3462
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:43,800
That's the one we signed.

3463
03:11:43,960 --> 03:11:44,940
Yes, yes, yes.

3464
03:11:48,040 --> 03:11:50,800
I offer this monopoly money in exchange for good times.

3465
03:11:51,260 --> 03:11:51,980
Thank you.

3466
03:11:55,480 --> 03:11:55,940
So...

3467
03:11:59,090 --> 03:12:01,870
I'll think of a way to stream Death Stranding.

3468
03:12:01,930 --> 03:12:03,470
I could always just stream it.

3469
03:12:05,110 --> 03:12:07,030
I'll get to like part 50.

3470
03:12:09,410 --> 03:12:10,050
You know.

3471
03:12:11,090 --> 03:12:12,490
There will be two viewers.

3472
03:12:13,470 --> 03:12:16,410
Two people that are like, oh man, I can't wait for part 51.

3473
03:12:16,410 --> 03:12:16,570
Oh god.

3474
03:12:21,110 --> 03:12:27,170
Have you ever had an experience where you bought too many games and you don't want to play any of the games because you can't decide what to play next?

3475
03:12:29,410 --> 03:12:30,390
Yes and no.

3476
03:12:30,890 --> 03:12:34,850
Sometimes I like have to be in a very specific mood for a game.

3477
03:12:35,010 --> 03:12:41,210
Like I want to play Bellatro, but I feel like for some games I have to be in a very specific mood for it.

3478
03:12:42,310 --> 03:12:42,710
So...

3479
03:12:42,710 --> 03:12:43,290
Thanks for the stream.

3480
03:12:43,390 --> 03:12:45,310
I'm taking the JLPT N3 tomorrow.

3481
03:12:45,730 --> 03:12:47,310
So this was a much needed break from studying.

3482
03:12:47,790 --> 03:12:49,270
Oh my gosh, Paul!

3483
03:12:49,770 --> 03:12:50,150
Ganbare!

3484
03:12:51,230 --> 03:12:52,070
Good luck.

3485
03:12:53,190 --> 03:12:54,010
Break a leg?

3486
03:12:57,990 --> 03:12:58,930
Loving the BGM.

3487
03:12:59,130 --> 03:13:00,770
Yeah, let's stop listening to the babies.

3488
03:13:02,490 --> 03:13:03,370
Let's listen...

3489
03:13:03,370 --> 03:13:04,370
Here, I'll put on my own BGM.

3490
03:13:05,950 --> 03:13:06,730
Where is it?

3491
03:13:08,530 --> 03:13:09,310
Oh, weird.

3492
03:13:15,230 --> 03:13:16,050
Ganbare!

3493
03:13:16,490 --> 03:13:17,110
Fight on!

3494
03:13:19,130 --> 03:13:20,070
O-ensuru yo.

3495
03:13:21,530 --> 03:13:23,150
O-ensuru yo.

3496
03:13:24,630 --> 03:13:25,690
Get that kanji.

3497
03:13:27,690 --> 03:13:29,590
You don't need to know stroke order.

3498
03:13:30,090 --> 03:13:31,250
But you got this.

3499
03:13:33,830 --> 03:13:35,070
Paul-san.

3500
03:13:39,110 --> 03:13:39,930
Yeah.

3501
03:13:39,930 --> 03:13:43,990
Well, I have some other stuff I'm going to be doing tonight.

3502
03:13:44,650 --> 03:13:46,170
So if I see you there, I'll see you.

3503
03:13:47,910 --> 03:13:53,270
And if not, tomorrow I'll be playing Made in Akiba...

3504
03:13:53,270 --> 03:13:54,290
What is it called?

3505
03:13:54,350 --> 03:13:55,450
Made Cafe in Aki...

3506
03:13:55,450 --> 03:13:55,890
Electric.

3507
03:13:56,130 --> 03:13:56,990
No, not Akiba.

3508
03:13:57,170 --> 03:13:58,850
It's not, because it's specifically Osaka.

3509
03:14:02,530 --> 03:14:04,170
Made in Electric Street, I think.

3510
03:14:06,730 --> 03:14:07,090
So...

3511
03:14:07,090 --> 03:14:08,510
Thank you for seven months.

3512
03:14:08,510 --> 03:14:09,130
Thank you!

3513
03:14:09,550 --> 03:14:10,710
Thanks real bad!

3514
03:14:14,130 --> 03:14:18,370
I'm trying to think.

3515
03:14:20,310 --> 03:14:20,970
What other stuff?

3516
03:14:21,310 --> 03:14:24,230
Oh, I might be making an appearance at somebody's birthday.

3517
03:14:26,410 --> 03:14:27,130
Just short.

3518
03:14:27,230 --> 03:14:28,570
I gotta go get some food first though.

3519
03:14:29,230 --> 03:14:30,450
I gotta get some food first.

3520
03:14:31,070 --> 03:14:32,250
So, thank you for stream.

3521
03:14:32,410 --> 03:14:32,890
Thank you!

3522
03:14:33,090 --> 03:14:34,490
Thank you for watching stream.

3523
03:14:34,610 --> 03:14:35,530
Thanks for hanging out with me.

3524
03:14:35,590 --> 03:14:36,830
I always appreciate it so much.

3525
03:14:37,530 --> 03:14:38,330
Looks so cute.

3526
03:14:38,370 --> 03:14:39,450
I was waiting for you to play it.

3527
03:14:39,850 --> 03:14:40,710
Wait, what looks cute?

3528
03:14:43,830 --> 03:14:44,550
What, what, what?

3529
03:14:48,030 --> 03:14:49,110
Before I forget...

3530
03:14:49,110 --> 03:14:50,630
Thanks Wall-E!

3531
03:14:51,390 --> 03:14:55,090
Wall-E for Space Golly, aka Wall-E for Golly.

3532
03:14:56,130 --> 03:14:58,150
Pink Bacon, thank you also for seven months.

3533
03:15:01,170 --> 03:15:02,650
Thank you for streaming too!

3534
03:15:03,070 --> 03:15:03,770
That's cool!

3535
03:15:06,830 --> 03:15:07,270
Okay.

3536
03:15:10,570 --> 03:15:11,530
Yeah, okay.

3537
03:15:11,770 --> 03:15:12,410
Thank you guys!

3538
03:15:12,850 --> 03:15:13,350
What's the main deal?

3539
03:15:13,730 --> 03:15:14,290
The maid game.

3540
03:15:14,410 --> 03:15:14,630
Oh!

3541
03:15:15,770 --> 03:15:16,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3542
03:15:16,770 --> 03:15:18,270
So many people tagged me about it.

3543
03:15:20,470 --> 03:15:23,290
Actually, they sent me an email about it.

3544
03:15:23,650 --> 03:15:26,510
They were going to give me a code for it.

3545
03:15:26,710 --> 03:15:29,470
I don't think it was going to be sponsored, technically.

3546
03:15:30,030 --> 03:15:35,550
But, in the end, I responded and then they never responded back.

3547
03:15:37,010 --> 03:15:40,310
But, it's funny because another friend gifted it to me instead.

3548
03:15:40,950 --> 03:15:43,010
So, another ghostly friend.

3549
03:15:45,710 --> 03:15:47,190
So, I was like, no!

3550
03:15:48,730 --> 03:15:49,530
It's okay!

3551
03:15:51,710 --> 03:15:53,470
The ghost got ghosted.

3552
03:15:54,210 --> 03:15:54,710
It's okay.

3553
03:15:55,230 --> 03:15:56,670
Like I said, I don't think it was sponsored.

3554
03:15:56,970 --> 03:15:59,010
I think they were just wanting to give me the code.

3555
03:15:59,150 --> 03:16:01,050
They were like, we saw you commenting.

3556
03:16:02,630 --> 03:16:03,130
One game?

3557
03:16:03,210 --> 03:16:03,410
Okay.

3558
03:16:03,810 --> 03:16:05,650
I'm going to try and not do another horror game.

3559
03:16:05,650 --> 03:16:08,730
But, I really want to do that cabin factory game.

3560
03:16:09,350 --> 03:16:11,630
Like, I mean, another horror game soon.

3561
03:16:11,810 --> 03:16:13,990
But, I think I'm going to try and do my next...

3562
03:16:13,990 --> 03:16:17,030
I feel like the cabin factory is very similar to this one.

3563
03:16:17,790 --> 03:16:19,610
I want to play the cabin factory.

3564
03:16:19,790 --> 03:16:20,750
I'm so excited for that one.

3565
03:16:25,370 --> 03:16:27,390
The game looks totally like a Minto game.

3566
03:16:27,490 --> 03:16:29,850
Yeah, I'm excited to see what it's all about.

3567
03:16:30,110 --> 03:16:31,350
I don't know if we'll beat it.

3568
03:16:32,330 --> 03:16:32,870
We'll see.

3569
03:16:34,470 --> 03:16:38,010
It's funny because they did ask me not to stream up to a certain point.

3570
03:16:38,890 --> 03:16:41,370
But then, they didn't give me the game.

3571
03:16:41,490 --> 03:16:43,370
So, do I have to still abide by that?

3572
03:16:43,970 --> 03:16:44,830
I'm not quite sure.

3573
03:16:46,190 --> 03:16:50,290
I might abide by it just so that I stay in their good graces.

3574
03:16:56,670 --> 03:17:00,310
If they ever want to sponsor me in the future or something.

3575
03:17:01,150 --> 03:17:02,270
I don't know.

3576
03:17:07,240 --> 03:17:08,700
Thank you guys!

3577
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:09,540
Otsubito!

3578
03:17:11,580 --> 03:17:17,960
Have a lovely day, a lovely night and I will see you guys next time!

3579
03:17:18,440 --> 03:17:19,340
Bye bye!

3580
03:17:19,680 --> 03:17:19,920
Bye bye!

3581
03:17:20,100 --> 03:17:21,140
Bye bye!

3582
03:17:23,060 --> 03:17:23,580
Otsubito!

3583
03:17:23,700 --> 03:17:23,980
Otsubito!

3584
03:17:24,300 --> 03:17:24,800
Bye bye!
