1
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,650
Hello,

2
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,510
everybody.

3
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,050
Hello, hello.

4
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,470
Hello, hello, hello.

5
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,250
Hello, hello.

6
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,330
Hello, hello, hello.

7
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,150
Howdy, do you welcome me?

8
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,300
I got my crowbar.

9
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,300
I got my glasses.

10
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,980
I'm ready for silence.

11
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,460
How many more Barneys, Minto?

12
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,740
How many more are there?

13
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,360
How many more?

14
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,040
They're all safe.

15
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,200
They all left.

16
00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:00,220
They all went to Grandpa's place in another city.

17
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,080
The farm.

18
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,720
Grandpa's farm.

19
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,660
And they are really being fed well.

20
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,820
Always.

21
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,920
She blinded me with science.

22
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,060
Also, Dante, welcome to Bamboo Ship.

23
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,860
Thank you.

24
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,760
Yeah, they're being fed well.

25
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:27,320
They get a good helping of creamed corn every day.

26
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,540
That is fresh from the farm.

27
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,000
And then they also get goat milk.

28
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,540
Can you drink that?

29
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,940
Can you drink goat milk?

30
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,880
They went to the farm up north.

31
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,360
Yee-haw.

32
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,300
Can we meet them anytime soon?

33
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,840
They're really busy.

34
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,800
Really, really, really busy.

35
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,580
Let's go!

36
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,180
Let's go!

37
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,780
Rodrigo, thank you so much for the five gifted.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
And Felix, welcome to Bamboo Ship.

39
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,040
Thank you.

40
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,400
Any remaining Barneys or stragglers who deserve what they get?

41
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,240
No!

42
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,140
I wouldn't recommend it.

43
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,300
What?

44
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,220
Drinking goat milk?

45
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,160
I don't drink regular milk really anymore at all.

46
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,100
I only drink oat milk.

47
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,140
So... I don't know how long today's stream will be.

48
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,980
I've heard conflicting information about how much of the game we have left.

49
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,540
Mito-chan.

50
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,280
What?

51
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,680
Oh!

52
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,260
Hi!

53
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,100
What do you like?

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Taka Mito!

55
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,860
Yorima A-nata!

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,940
My favorite art... I saw one... Hold on.

57
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,500
Hold on.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
Let me play one for you that I saw on TikTok yesterday.

59
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,820
Hold on.

60
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,080
Let me play it for you guys.

61
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,460
Hold on.

62
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
Let me play it for you guys.

63
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,840
I saved it because I was laughing.

64
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
Wait, where is it?

65
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,780
Wait, where is it?

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,060
Where did it go?

67
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,400
No!

68
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,390
No!

69
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,070
Wait, did they delete it?

70
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,950
No way, I saw it literally yesterday.

71
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,290
Oh wait, I found it.

72
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,030
I think this is it.

73
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,850
Okay, it's trains.

74
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,830
Oh, and buses.

75
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,650
And then it shows for their favorite flavor.

76
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,250
It shows...

77
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,950
It shows for their favorite flavor.

78
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,870
It's like coal.

79
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,210
And for the bus, it's like...

80
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,470
It's like petroleum.

81
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,720
Yeah.

82
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,860
Coal and electricity.

83
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,740
Yeah, it's so good.

84
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,160
So I was laughing about that.

85
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,460
Good afternoon, Mintero.

86
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,120
Good afternoon!

87
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,380
Coal yorimo a-na-ta.

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,660
But um, yeah.

89
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,760
So, I don't know how long today will be.

90
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,680
I guess we'll...

91
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,060
I guess we'll...

92
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,480
Just play and find out.

93
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,920
Me and my best friend just took our relationship to the next level!

94
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,700
Oh, we bought a Lego set together.

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,960
What kind of Lego set?

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,180
Because that also really determines the friendship.

97
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,060
Or not...

98
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,240
The relationship, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,500
The relationship level.

100
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,780
You should later check out the prototype model for Gordon.

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,620
Also known as Lumberjack Gordon.

102
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,520
I will.

103
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,160
Barney's been to live up...

104
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,880
Live on that farm up north along with the goldfish from her childhood.

105
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,280
Yeah!

106
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,860
Yeah, I have betta fish.

107
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,200
Wake up, Miss Phantom.

108
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,620
Wake up and finish Half-Life.

109
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,540
I need to wake up.

110
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
It's such a...

111
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,660
It's such a sleepy day for me.

112
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,450
It's a sleepy day for me!

113
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,650
Star Wars Lego!

114
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,110
Okay, that's pretty serious.

115
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,370
That's really...

116
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,710
That's actually pretty serious.

117
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,050
Thank you for all your positive entertainment though.

118
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,970
You're welcome!

119
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,930
Was that good?

120
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,990
Goat cheese is a whole different game from cow.

121
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,810
I eat sometimes cheese.

122
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,110
EP Saturday is relatable.

123
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,710
I know!

124
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,690
Oh, and because I wasn't gonna initially stream today...

125
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,970
I guess I had it in my brain that I was like...

126
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,590
I don't know...

127
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,690
I'm just gonna...

128
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,090
I'm just gonna work on stuff today.

129
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,030
So I can...

130
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,310
But...

131
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,370
That's not the case.

132
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,630
Instead, we're playing Half-Life.

133
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,570
And that's okay.

134
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,070
We are here.

135
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,110
Forget about Freeman.

136
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,630
Right?

137
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,430
Yeah!

138
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,170
Yeah!

139
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,690
Forget about...

140
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,710
Forget about him!

141
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,370
Forget about him!

142
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,890
Forget about him!

143
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,490
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

144
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,910
So...

145
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,110
Wait, hold on.

146
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,350
Let me see something real quick.

147
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,590
Uh...

148
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,670
Uh...

149
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,890
Uh...

150
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,330
Cutscene.

151
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,410
Not an actual...

152
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,810
Not an actual chapter.

153
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,550
So...

154
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,470
We can doubt it.

155
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,070
We got this.

156
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,210
We got this.

157
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,310
Two of those chapters are really nothing.

158
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,710
Oh!

159
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,610
A couple of them are very short.

160
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,350
Alright!

161
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,410
I'm excited!

162
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,650
I can't wait to see the ending!

163
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,390
I wanna know what's going on with...

164
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:55,930
With...

165
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,670
With...

166
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,630
With...

167
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,790
The man!

168
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,230
The man!

169
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,610
The Hakai!

170
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,070
Oh...

171
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,870
G-Man!

172
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,030
G-Man!

173
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:07,970
G-Man!

174
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,730
I wanna see...

175
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,650
I wanna see...

176
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,470
The man!

177
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,170
The man!

178
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,610
The man!

179
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:12,710
The man!

180
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,390
So let's get into it.

181
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,830
Oh, I still have my little snark in my hand.

182
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,130
I remember this part.

183
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,570
I got...

184
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,370
I could die here.

185
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,190
What is my...

186
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,830
What is my...

187
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:27,950
What is my...

188
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,210
Bullet situation?

189
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,950
Look at 13.

190
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,310
250.

191
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,790
121.

192
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,730
24 crossbows.

193
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
Uh...

194
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,520
Oh...

195
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,360
Oh...

196
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh...

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,900
Oh, here's somebody.

198
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,600
Oh, here's somebody in there.

199
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:49,940
Um...

200
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,540
But I'm just gonna...

201
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,100
I'm just gonna equip my revolver.

202
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,960
Equip...

203
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,400
Equip my revolver.

204
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,880
Reload my guns, maybe?

205
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,860
That's such a good idea.

206
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,180
Does this...

207
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,220
What is this usually at?

208
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,080
Okay, it's good.

209
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,300
This is...

210
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,220
Eight.

211
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,680
Yeah.

212
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,160
I guess that's one...

213
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,320
Oh, that one's at five.

214
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:17,580
Okay.

215
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,900
That one's always at one.

216
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,220
This is the energy beam.

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,040
Our little...

218
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,520
Or is this...

219
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,100
This is...

220
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,640
Not the snark.

221
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:27,960
Okay.

222
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay.

223
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,640
Alright, I'm gonna save just because I just reload.

224
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,920
So...

225
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm safe.

226
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm safe.

227
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm not safe.

228
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,680
I'm not safe.

229
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,620
Uh...

230
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,360
Let me out, please.

231
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm not safe.

232
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,780
I'm not safe.

233
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,540
I'm not safe.

234
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm not safe.

235
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,320
I was not safe.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,340
Oh my goodness.

237
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,740
Is there a...

238
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,660
Is there a way I can crash jump?

239
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,160
No.

240
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,600
Okay.

241
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,780
Uh...

242
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,540
Understandable.

243
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,440
Oh my gosh.

244
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,880
Uh...

245
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh my gosh.

246
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,900
Okay.

247
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,740
I got it.

248
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,840
I got it.

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
Oh, yeah.

250
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:26,980
Yes.

251
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,960
Not yes.

252
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,320
No, Marty!

253
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,660
I'm running!

254
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:33,740
You like!

255
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,080
Oh!

256
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,120
God.

257
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,700
I'm running!

258
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,440
I'm running!

259
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,760
Oh my god!

260
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,120
I don't think I should just be running.

261
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,040
Wait...

262
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,300
Um...

263
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,780
I think I'm in trouble.

264
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,530
Barney!

265
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,670
Barney, get to safety!

266
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,610
Barney, get to safety!

267
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,810
What are you doing?

268
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,650
We gotta... we gotta... we gotta get out of here!

269
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,170
Yeah, you should.

270
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,850
You should have a bad feeling.

271
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,990
Okay, I'm gonna use my crossbow and...

272
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,710
He's dead.

273
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,690
Oh my god.

274
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,990
Oh my god, there's a guy there, too.

275
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,150
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

276
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,550
Okay, I got his ass.

277
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,750
Ugh.

278
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:50,810
Okay.

279
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,250
Barney!

280
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,810
Oh...

281
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,490
We better be careful.

282
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,530
Yeah, we should.

283
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,310
Okay.

284
00:13:59,290 --> 00:13:59,890
Let's see.

285
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,790
I'm scared.

286
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,570
I thought I saw something over there, but...

287
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,710
I guess it's a guy behind here?

288
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,510
Oh my god!

289
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,210
Oh my god!

290
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,930
Oh my god, an ambush for real!

291
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,250
Ah!

292
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:19,990
Okay.

293
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,010
Hmm.

294
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,550
He knew!

295
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,050
How did he know?

296
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,150
My guy's so smart.

297
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,210
Maybe...

298
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,730
I'm trying to think of a different gun to use.

299
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,470
My target range time is gonna pay off today.

300
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,730
What just... what are you talking about?

301
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,430
Ugh.

302
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,230
Now you know when no one gets half the battle.

303
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,210
True?

304
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,510
Wait.

305
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:47,590
Wait.

306
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,280
I think I got him.

307
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,250
I think I got him.

308
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,650
Wait.

309
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,390
Okay.

310
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,730
Oh, I only have four, though.

311
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,570
Okay, we're gonna have to be...

312
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,490
We're gonna have to be good.

313
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,790
Oops.

314
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,090
I'm warming up, you guys.

315
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,690
We're gonna get my hands on the guy who spawns

316
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:37,970
him.

317
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,190
Put C4 where they spawn!

318
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,530
That is so stinking smart.

319
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,970
Like, here?

320
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,910
Do you think Barney will get hit?

321
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:50,330
Oh.

322
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,710
Okay, Barney.

323
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,870
Just...

324
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,470
Oh, shoot.

325
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,490
I didn't think he would, like...

326
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,530
He would, like, toss it.

327
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,470
I didn't think it bounced.

328
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,030
I thought C4 was heavy.

329
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,150
Ah...

330
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,420
Rip Barney.

331
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:08,980
No!

332
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,420
He's blocked by...

333
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,380
Gosh.

334
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,260
No!

335
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,540
That's not what I meant to do.

336
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,380
Sorry, Barney.

337
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:17,760
Okay.

338
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,920
Um, hopefully...

339
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,840
We'll be fine.

340
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,520
I bet to press...

341
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,460
F7.

342
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Ah!

343
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,460
C4!

344
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,280
Oh, my God.

345
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,000
Uh...

346
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,670
Critical.

347
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,490
It worked.

348
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,760
Don't even.

349
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,800
Don't even!

350
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,600
And Barney is...

351
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,640
Oh.

352
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,180
Another one?

353
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,440
It doesn't look right.

354
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,300
You're right, Barney.

355
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,740
This is so bad!

356
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,720
We're in a predicament, Barney!

357
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,020
I wonder if those boys could have made a bigger mess.

358
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,280
I wish I could...

359
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,700
Oh, gosh.

360
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,020
It doesn't help that there's two of them.

361
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,260
There's two of the big...

362
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,900
The Beemen!

363
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,700
Oh, gosh.

364
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
Take Barney with you.

365
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,660
That's for sure.

366
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,880
That will for sure kill him.

367
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,500
Lead him away.

368
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,400
Oh, you know what?

369
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,920
That's even better.

370
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,580
Okay, I'll cover you.

371
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,340
Come here, come here, come here.

372
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,660
Is this far away enough for you?

373
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah, I'll wait here.

374
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,180
This should be far away enough.

375
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm trying to figure out what to do here.

376
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,880
What's the best course of action?

377
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,720
Maybe...

378
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,700
Maybe just grenade?

379
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,000
I only have four, though.

380
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,500
A fear for this thing.

381
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,040
Tripmine?

382
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,340
This is the tripmine, right?

383
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,600
Alright.

384
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,420
But doesn't...

385
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,440
Don't they have to be, like, close to this thing?

386
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,700
No?

387
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,530
I know, me too.

388
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,070
They have to touch the laser.

389
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,950
Okay, if I put it, like, here...

390
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,340
If we die, we die.

391
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,360
Okay.

392
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,760
I guess we'll just keep...

393
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,640
We'll just keep trying until we make it.

394
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,430
Maybe this...

395
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,480
This gun might be better, even.

396
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,440
Oh, I don't know.

397
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,240
Okay.

398
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,420
Put them everywhere where the dudes spawn.

399
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,880
Trial and error.

400
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,790
It's quiet?

401
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,090
It's not quiet.

402
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,510
It's not quiet at all.

403
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,490
Oh, my God!

404
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,770
Barney!

405
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,350
Barney, you did it!

406
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,430
He's a hero!

407
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,590
He's a hero!

408
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,370
Oh, my God!

409
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,130
How did you do that?

410
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,830
You're amazing.

411
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,390
You stay here, Barney.

412
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,630
Oh, my gosh.

413
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,630
The goat.

414
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,730
The greatest of all time, actually!

415
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,220
Can I...

416
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,500
See, there's two ways we can go, it seems.

417
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,020
Okay, hold on, sorry.

418
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:07,800
Oh.

419
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,340
Dang it.

420
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,020
Okay, hold on.

421
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,280
Oh.

422
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,260
No, no, no, no.

423
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,740
I'm trying to figure out...

424
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,840
Oh!

425
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,820
Oh!

426
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,360
Oh!

427
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,740
Oh, oh, oh!

428
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh!

429
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,260
Oh, my God.

430
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, we're doing...

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,700
We're doing it!

432
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,820
I regret my retract...

433
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,540
Retract...

434
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,240
Earlier statement.

435
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,680
Straggler Barney for the win.

436
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,020
It's me, Gordon!

437
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Wait, what is...

438
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,780
Wait, what is...

439
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,480
What's going on?

440
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,620
What is that?

441
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,080
Wait, what just happened?

442
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,940
What is this?

443
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Oh, it's a snark!

444
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,810
Oh, my God, they're killing me!

445
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,730
They explode!

446
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:04,790
Dude!

447
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,010
Okay.

448
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,910
Redo.

449
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
Okay.

450
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,660
They're like little fleas!

451
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,240
Oh, my God.

452
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,020
I got another one.

453
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,020
Good job, Barney!

454
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,880
He has aim of a God!

455
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,100
You should be playing this game, not me.

456
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,400
Those don't look like my snarks.

457
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,380
Mine are much cuter.

458
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,420
I think.

459
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,410
Okay.

460
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,830
So true.

461
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:03,890
Yeah.

462
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,450
Another one of these.

463
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,290
Okay.

464
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,690
Oh, what is that?

465
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,810
Oh, another thing.

466
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,050
Wait, I don't want to waste mine.

467
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,290
What if I do this?

468
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,770
Get me out of here!

469
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,430
Barney, save me!

470
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,490
Barney, I don't trust anybody but you!

471
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,190
Barney!

472
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,170
Barney, they're coming!

473
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,170
They're coming for me, Barney!

474
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,050
What was that?

475
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,070
He walked away.

476
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,590
He was like, this is your...

477
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,770
This is your...

478
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:48,830
Oh, wait.

479
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,570
I think they exploded.

480
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,970
Oh, they're exploding!

481
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,670
Stupids.

482
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,190
Apparently, Steve!

483
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,290
Thank you so much for the ticket to take you!

484
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,330
Oh my gosh.

485
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,990
Okay, so we know...

486
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,890
The arrows are leading this way, but we know this room is kinda crazy.

487
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,110
So...

488
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,490
Get my crossbow out.

489
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,510
Reload it.

490
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,050
Okay.

491
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,480
Alright.

492
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,680
Got two of them?

493
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,360
Anybody else in here?

494
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,800
Got you!

495
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,020
I'm save scumming, saving after every hit.

496
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
And this will unleash the snarks?

497
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,000
That's what that does?

498
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:48,690
Yeah.

499
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,170
Barney!

500
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,930
That's a great question.

501
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,730
They'll explode.

502
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,450
This might not be the strat, but...

503
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,490
Might also be the strat.

504
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,710
Emotional support, Barney.

505
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,290
There's so much...

506
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:28,990
What is...

507
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,610
I don't...

508
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:29,910
Like...

509
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,270
So...

510
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,270
I'm assuming I have to...

511
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,050
Or maybe...

512
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,110
Do I have to kill these?

513
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,390
What is sniffing around in there?

514
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,370
You hear that?

515
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,990
Oops.

516
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,630
There we go.

517
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,840
We just ran away.

518
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,640
I don't have good enough aim to deal with these guys!

519
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,500
They'll...

520
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,300
If it works, it works!

521
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,430
They're like, what?

522
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,850
Is this a...

523
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,010
Oh, is this a...

524
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,290
No?

525
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,910
Oh, this...

526
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,450
Okay, hold on.

527
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,330
Before we...

528
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,470
Empty that though...

529
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,290
I do want to see what's on this side.

530
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:29,870
You know?

531
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:33,810
Oh my god!

532
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,190
Let's see...

533
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,370
What's the best gun for this guy?

534
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,170
Maybe...

535
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,770
Maybe...

536
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,190
Uh...

537
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,810
This.

538
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,110
Where are you?

539
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,340
I guess I could've blown him up with this, but...

540
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,500
Whatever.

541
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,740
I hear another one.

542
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,860
Oh!

543
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,860
Barney help!

544
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,820
Barney help!

545
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,790
The fleas!

546
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,770
Dang it, I was trying to get both of the nests at once.

547
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,370
But...

548
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,690
Clearly that doesn't happen.

549
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:37,550
Okay.

550
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,470
Okay, maybe...

551
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,110
Maybe like this.

552
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,290
I feel kinda silly running away each time, but...

553
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,740
Barney, are you okay?

554
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,620
They didn't explode on you?

555
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,620
Alright, we're fine.

556
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,880
I should like try and lead them over here and blow up the...

557
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,520
The C4 that I left.

558
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,600
Maybe if I like...

559
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,860
Run over here this way, I can blow them up.

560
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,620
And I'll...

561
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,100
Go heal up!

562
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,160
I have no health left!

563
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,960
Unless there's some up here.

564
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,960
Did I miss one in here?

565
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,100
I know I picked up something.

566
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,400
What is this?

567
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,060
Oh.

568
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,800
Uh...

569
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
What did I just do?

570
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,780
Oh my god, no!

571
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,370
Barney?

572
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,580
Is this thing gonna come out every time I go down now?

573
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Wait, what's this do?

574
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,380
Maybe I should...

575
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,160
Maybe I should not...

576
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,120
Maybe I should not...

577
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,920
Brist pull levers.

578
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,780
No way.

579
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,340
Barney!

580
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,460
Barney, I'm sorry.

581
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,260
I didn't know!

582
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,900
I didn't know!

583
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,400
Load for Barney.

584
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,540
Wait, how far am I?

585
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,380
How...

586
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,780
I don't think I killed this guy.

587
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,860
Yeah.

588
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,540
Easy.

589
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,140
It's fine.

590
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,520
Everything's fine!

591
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,720
I only have four grenades.

592
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,220
Okay.

593
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,660
We won't do it again!

594
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't worry!

595
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,300
I missed everything!

596
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,980
Barney!

597
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,280
I missed every shot!

598
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,220
There goes another Barney to the farm up north!

599
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:33,980
No!

600
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,340
Guys, I missed every single shot.

601
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,040
It was...

602
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,680
It was pathetic.

603
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,300
It was sad.

604
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,320
We all saw it.

605
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,600
Okay.

606
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,660
We don't need to...

607
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,240
We don't need to think about it any longer.

608
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,560
It was...

609
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:46,840
Oh wait.

610
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,840
Oh wait.

611
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,460
I can redeem myself!

612
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,800
Here...

613
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,420
Uh, well...

614
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,320
I'm just gonna keep...

615
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,620
It's fine.

616
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,120
Okay.

617
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,340
I'm gonna redeem myself!

618
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm gonna redeem myself!

619
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,480
It was impressive, was it?

620
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,080
Watch out Barney!

621
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,240
Wait!

622
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,960
No!

623
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,540
No!

624
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:08,760
No!

625
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,200
I hit it!

626
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,040
I hit it!

627
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,120
I hit it though!

628
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,300
No, I didn't.

629
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,860
Maybe I did?

630
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,920
Hold on.

631
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,600
You can't shoot them.

632
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:35,940
Oh...

633
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,460
Yeah!

634
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,720
You need to use the trigger.

635
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,040
Well, shucks.

636
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,870
How do I get in there?

637
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,890
Through the door?

638
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,730
Oh!

639
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,440
This looks like an ambush.

640
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,800
Oh!

641
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,620
Oh!

642
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,900
It kind of was.

643
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,700
Can I take that?

644
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,200
Wait, let me have that.

645
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,180
Can I take it?

646
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,820
I must be full.

647
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,560
Full on snarks.

648
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,720
Dang.

649
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,960
Okay, but let's just remember this area, just in case.

650
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,340
Can I use snarks?

651
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,880
On the demons?

652
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,220
Like, on the monsters?

653
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,460
Does it work?

654
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,260
Look at this guy.

655
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:39,960
Wow.

656
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,820
That looks crazy.

657
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,340
I never noticed that he's got an arm coming out of his chest.

658
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,960
Yes!

659
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,920
You can use Q to hot-swap the last and current gun.

660
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,580
I don't do that, only because I think it'll mess me up.

661
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,240
No.

662
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,400
No!

663
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,120
No!

664
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,260
So much for trying the snarks.

665
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,640
They're not loyal.

666
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,110
I can't tell which one this is.

667
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,310
What's making the noise?

668
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,210
Oh.

669
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,010
Fuck the doors!

670
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,970
Okay, never mind.

671
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,920
Oh, he's running around.

672
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,240
Did someone just teleport behind me?

673
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,700
Who teleports behind you?

674
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
Oh, that personnel, kid.

675
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,700
Snark him?

676
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,240
You saw what happened last time.

677
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,440
No?

678
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,400
Oh, hello?

679
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,240
Ouch.

680
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,280
I got him.

681
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:10,800
It's okay.

682
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,620
I think there's another one.

683
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,020
Oh, yeah.

684
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,680
Yep, yep, yep.

685
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,140
Yep.

686
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,680
Oh, my God!

687
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,180
Ouch!

688
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,600
Oh, the homing beats suck!

689
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,500
What if I...

690
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,620
Wait, how do you use this again?

691
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,620
Um...

692
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,160
You, like...

693
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
These ones home.

694
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,620
Come back.

695
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,300
Oh, look!

696
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,400
Oh, I think that worked!

697
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:52,810
Awesome.

698
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,370
I think that worked.

699
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,070
Yeah, baby.

700
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,750
What else is in here?

701
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,630
There's some crates.

702
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,350
Hopefully some health.

703
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,250
I don't want to quite go on that yet.

704
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,370
Uh...

705
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,170
Oh, my gosh.

706
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,410
Is that...

707
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,210
Yes.

708
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,370
Just a little bit of armor.

709
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,610
Just the tiniest bit.

710
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,670
Oh, yes!

711
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,790
Okay.

712
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,570
That scares me.

713
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:25,450
Oh.

714
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,840
Nothing.

715
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,300
Okay.

716
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,440
Wow, he's tough.

717
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,540
No.

718
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,700
Delta, thank you so much for the 5th sentence.

719
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,080
Thank you.

720
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,380
Holy cannoli.

721
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:04,800
Okay.

722
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:05,700
Alright.

723
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,360
Get my crossbow ready.

724
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,780
Oops.

725
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,160
More snarks.

726
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,380
There's something on top there, too.

727
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,460
Oh, there's stuff up there, too.

728
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,720
No, no, no.

729
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,360
Stop, stop, stop.

730
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,420
No.

731
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,700
Like, let me get off.

732
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,200
Get me off this ride!

733
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,580
Okay.

734
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,420
Oh, I missed.

735
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:30,840
Oh, wait.

736
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,860
I think I can just jump here.

737
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,320
Oh, no.

738
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
I don't think I can jump this high.

739
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,640
Okay, hold on.

740
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,760
Where do I go, though?

741
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,160
Oh, duh.

742
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,460
I know where we need to go.

743
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,380
Remember, we need the...

744
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,660
The...

745
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,980
Oh, I think I'm hearing electricity.

746
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,640
We gotta lower the water.

747
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,370
Oh, just kidding.

748
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,610
That doesn't lower the water.

749
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,430
We go in.

750
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,550
Okay, watch.

751
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,030
Don't die.

752
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,630
Don't die.

753
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,990
What was I saying?

754
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,230
Watch the ladder.

755
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,010
Do you see the laser?

756
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,180
Oh, my God.

757
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,600
No way.

758
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
I can't shoot through the...

759
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,060
Oh, yes, I can.

760
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,680
That guy was gonna jump and he was...

761
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,140
No, no.

762
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,240
They said forget about Freeman.

763
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,540
They don't care about me anymore.

764
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,460
Right?

765
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,160
They don't care about me anymore.

766
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,280
Right?

767
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,580
I wanna get rid of this thing, though.

768
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,840
Um, okay, hold on.

769
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,420
I'm gonna throw...

770
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,720
I'm just gonna throw a grenade down.

771
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,520
Wait.

772
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,160
Will it work?

773
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,600
I wonder.

774
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,800
Time to see.

775
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,540
Will I die?

776
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,750
Oh, it's a turret laser.

777
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:26,990
Oh, no.

778
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,140
Thank you so much for the spooky doll.

779
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,800
Thank you.

780
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,860
Aw, man.

781
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,860
But we can get it first, maybe.

782
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,200
Can I...

783
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,280
Can I...

784
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,480
Say if I, like...

785
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,300
Can I duck underneath it?

786
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,920
Okay.

787
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,980
I guess that worked.

788
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm scared of the men more than the monsters.

789
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,160
I'm scared of the men more than the monsters.

790
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,620
Oh, my God!

791
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,180
I didn't want to use a crossbow on you, but...

792
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,640
Whatever.

793
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,940
BabyCore, thank you so much for the vibe.

794
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,720
Good to thank you!

795
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,960
I don't see any men.

796
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,500
Come on.

797
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:26,800
Come on, guys.

798
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,580
Team...

799
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,060
Teamwork!

800
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,000
Let's work to...

801
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,960
Forget about Gordon!

802
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,280
Forget about Freeman!

803
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,460
Right?

804
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,380
That's what they all say!

805
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,140
Oh, shoot.

806
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,280
Oh, oh.

807
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,540
Hold on.

808
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,600
Uh...

809
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,540
What if I just...

810
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,680
Leave me alone!

811
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,860
Wait, was that another one?

812
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,820
No...

813
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,300
Shot?

814
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,720
Is that...

815
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,920
Is that one in the water?

816
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,740
Just a touch overkill?

817
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,680
Maybe, but...

818
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,960
Oh, it was the bits?

819
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,160
That were still flying around?

820
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,460
Little bits...

821
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:08,960
Flying around.

822
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,360
Okay.

823
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,780
I'll have my...

824
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,100
Revolver open instead.

825
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,280
Oh, wait.

826
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,320
I have full water.

827
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:20,900
Uh...

828
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,320
Full water?

829
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,720
I'm sorry.

830
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,360
Full health!

831
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,460
Sorry.

832
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:27,920
Sorry.

833
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,100
Just looking at the water.

834
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,110
Wait, didn't I just kill that guy?

835
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:41,750
So...

836
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,390
I should be able to jump on top?

837
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:47,490
Like...

838
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,950
The sound's...

839
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,490
Electrified.

840
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,250
Full of water, baby!

841
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,220
I'm full of water.

842
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,540
I actually am.

843
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,780
You're scared of me!

844
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,700
You're scared of me!

845
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
Oh, there's a head grab.

846
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,360
Uh...

847
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,700
Ah!

848
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,940
Okay.

849
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,860
I'm just gonna save.

850
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,830
Maybe it's just a radio.

851
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,250
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

852
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,590
A rope?

853
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:42,730
Help!

854
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,690
Oh my god, not you again.

855
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,470
Oh my god!

856
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,710
I don't know how I didn't get hurt at all from that, but...

857
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,990
Wait, I can't...

858
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,250
Oh, I can only shoot with this in the water, right?

859
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,890
He came straight at me!

860
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,750
Where could he be?

861
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,070
Where could he be?

862
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,990
You think he's still right there?

863
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,830
C4 him.

864
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,210
Pistol too.

865
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:14,690
Ah...

866
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,610
But pistol probably would take a lot of hits, huh?

867
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,550
Fish grenade.

868
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,650
I don't have so many, uh...

869
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,810
Oh my god, he is right there.

870
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,810
Oh my god.

871
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,310
I can't see!

872
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:25,650
Ow!

873
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,810
I can't see!

874
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,970
I can't see!

875
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,480
When did I switch to that?

876
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:38,590
Oops.

877
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:39,370
Okay.

878
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,130
We're fine.

879
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,640
Oh my god, he's stronger than I thought!

880
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,550
Okay.

881
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,790
I thought he would take like two hits.

882
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,430
He's tanky.

883
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,470
I can't...

884
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,530
I know the water is so opaque.

885
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,750
Oh my god, wait.

886
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,710
I can't see where he walked!

887
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,010
Okay, fine.

888
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:13,650
We'll...

889
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,250
We'll...

890
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,010
We'll grenade him.

891
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,750
Think I got him?

892
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,360
Not even close.

893
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,880
What do you mean not even close?

894
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,060
Think he's still underneath me?

895
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,750
You can crouch by where you saved to see it.

896
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,150
Oh, true!

897
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,050
Oh!

898
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,350
There he is!

899
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,290
Aw, man!

900
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,250
Well done.

901
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,790
Okay, let's try it.

902
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,150
Can I shoot him through here?

903
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,070
Instead?

904
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,930
Where is he?

905
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:23,210
Where is he?

906
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:23,650
Oh, there he is.

907
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,590
Oh!

908
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,390
Oh.

909
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,450
That was ineffective.

910
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,370
Hornet gun can get him?

911
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,050
True!

912
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,690
I love the hornet gun.

913
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,410
Reload, reload, reload!

914
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:42,530
Run!

915
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,680
Where are they?

916
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,220
Oh.

917
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,420
They can't go inside.

918
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:57,840
Okay.

919
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:58,960
Good to know.

920
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,520
Not the bees.

921
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,380
Do you think they're homing in on him though?

922
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,500
Hmm.

923
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,180
That's what I want...

924
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,340
Oh!

925
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,120
Wait!

926
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,640
Oh, no.

927
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,280
Oh, God!

928
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:14,720
Oh, no!

929
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,500
Oh, God!

930
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,540
Wait!

931
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,680
What was that sound then?

932
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,480
Oh, my God!

933
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:33,920
Is that it?

934
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,200
I don't trust it.

935
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,460
Okay, okay.

936
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,160
Checking.

937
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,060
Oh, my God!

938
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,080
Oh!

939
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:01,980
That sounded...

940
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,920
That sounded promising!

941
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,500
Oh, my God!

942
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,520
Seriously!

943
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,680
He's the biggest fish ever!

944
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,060
Do you think that was it?

945
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,940
Okay, it didn't hit.

946
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:22,540
So, maybe.

947
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,320
No, I think I just saw him swim.

948
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,920
Oh, I forgot there's a man around.

949
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,160
It's too mis...

950
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,580
Is he eating the bees?

951
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,660
I don't...

952
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,040
Just fighting raw dog.

953
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,780
With my...

954
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,920
With my...

955
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,640
With my...

956
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,100
Oh, my gosh, bow!

957
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,060
I mean, my...

958
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,160
Crowbar!

959
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,900
Alright, let's try.

960
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,680
Save first.

961
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,480
Yeah, we have nothing to lose.

962
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,720
Two hits!

963
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,060
After all of that!

964
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,260
Two stinking hits!

965
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,300
What is that?

966
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,720
It looks like a bomb, no?

967
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,810
Two stinking hits!

968
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,190
The bee gun actually did work, though.

969
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,230
Yeah, he was already low because of the bee gun.

970
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:37,790
So, cool.

971
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,630
Um...

972
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,910
Now we don't have to worry about...

973
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,130
Stupid.

974
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,110
Oh, there's another gun.

975
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,090
There's another turret.

976
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,110
Right there.

977
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,010
Um...

978
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:00,610
Hmm...

979
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:05,410
I feel like I could get it through the bars, but...

980
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,110
I would have to be...

981
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:09,750
Exact.

982
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,950
Like that.

983
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,200
Okay.

984
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,580
We got six shots left!

985
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,200
No!

986
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,520
My revolver!

987
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,390
That was some fancy shooting.

988
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:36,050
Thanks!

989
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,390
Alright, let's just go, I suppose.

990
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,470
Hope there's no other big guy around.

991
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:43,290
Wait, what the heck is this?

992
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,450
Oh, I go through the hole.

993
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,600
Uh...

994
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,140
How do I get through this one?

995
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,140
Uh...

996
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:13,540
Uh...

997
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,650
Same way, crouch?

998
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:21,770
Oh, god.

999
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,650
Oh...

1000
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,170
We made it somehow.

1001
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,490
Let's go.

1002
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:39,950
Damn it.

1003
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:41,830
Uh...

1004
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:42,170
Hold on.

1005
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,320
Did mine get him?

1006
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:54,840
Might have?

1007
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,720
Oh, no!

1008
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,140
Nope!

1009
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,700
Nope!

1010
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,620
Okay, we got him.

1011
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,380
Let's go.

1012
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,080
Oh my gosh, please.

1013
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,440
Please.

1014
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,960
I can't...

1015
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,540
I can't jump.

1016
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,780
I don't know how.

1017
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,580
Okay.

1018
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,560
I know that I took out the thing, but I just don't trust it, you know?

1019
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,820
I'm scared.

1020
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,100
Oh.

1021
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,180
Nice!

1022
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:30,980
Nice!

1023
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:31,780
That scares me.

1024
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,440
Why did they give us two med packs?

1025
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,400
Why did they give us two med packs?

1026
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,400
I'm scared.

1027
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:38,980
Okay.

1028
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,580
Save.

1029
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,900
A lot of rocket launchers.

1030
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,300
Yeah, it's like they're telling me something or...

1031
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:45,940
Something.

1032
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,840
No reason.

1033
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,180
What if I bee him?

1034
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,960
Go, my bees!

1035
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,320
Bees!

1036
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,200
This is actually helping the environment.

1037
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,040
We're repopulating the bee's population.

1038
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,400
Hello?

1039
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,880
Oh shit.

1040
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,940
Oh my god, they're all throwing.

1041
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,760
Wait, is that a tank?

1042
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,460
Oh, no!

1043
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,200
It's a tank!

1044
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:40,960
Uh...

1045
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,760
Where's mine?

1046
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,660
Uh...

1047
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,000
Hmm...

1048
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,470
Uh, wait.

1049
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,090
It's the red laser that follows, right?

1050
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,570
Or...

1051
00:50:58,570 --> 00:50:59,670
Oh my goodness.

1052
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,030
Stop!

1053
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,120
Is this doing anything?

1054
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,100
Oh, it did!

1055
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:15,800
It totally did!

1056
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,320
Nice.

1057
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,520
Oh my gosh.

1058
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,000
Uh...

1059
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,880
No!

1060
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,160
I'm gonna die!

1061
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,080
Oh gosh!

1062
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,060
Oh my god, that was so close.

1063
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,400
Oh, he's dead.

1064
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,960
Oh my god.

1065
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,140
Oh my god!

1066
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,490
Five HP!

1067
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:39,730
That's not great.

1068
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,470
That's not good.

1069
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,110
Black Mesa Central Complex.

1070
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,480
Oh my god!

1071
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,400
Oh my god!

1072
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,560
That's evil!

1073
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,340
That's so evil!

1074
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,290
I don't even know.

1075
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,150
I'm gonna manually save this one.

1076
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,910
I don't know if I should keep the save for this.

1077
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:29,290
So bad.

1078
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,580
Wait, what?

1079
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,780
Oh, okay.

1080
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,140
The HEV suit has no confidence in you.

1081
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,720
I have no confidence in me.

1082
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,760
Why are we going down?

1083
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,820
Where are we going, Gordon Freeman?

1084
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,900
Grab the rockets.

1085
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,960
Oh yeah, you're so right, actually.

1086
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,400
Thank you.

1087
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,040
That's a good idea.

1088
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,240
Yeah, grab those extra rockets.

1089
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,240
Oh gosh.

1090
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,280
Don't die.

1091
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,460
Okay.

1092
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,780
We're fine.

1093
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,260
Yeah.

1094
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,240
Yeah, since I used all of them.

1095
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,380
On the tank.

1096
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,660
Good thinking.

1097
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,320
Thanks, guys.

1098
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,290
Is this the Lambda Complex?

1099
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,870
It says not that.

1100
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:29,090
Sorry.

1101
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,450
Oh, I think it was this one.

1102
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:31,110
Save it.

1103
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,010
Okay.

1104
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:33,330
Okay.

1105
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,870
Okay.

1106
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,420
Okay.

1107
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,460
We're going down, down.

1108
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,790
Ooh.

1109
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:50,630
I'm ready.

1110
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:51,790
Oh.

1111
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,790
My Geiger counter is going crazy.

1112
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:13,910
Okay.

1113
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,450
Maybe there wasn't anybody over there.

1114
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,690
What's the emergency sound for?

1115
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:22,750
Barney?

1116
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:24,150
Oh, no.

1117
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,450
Oh, Barney.

1118
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:26,610
Barney!

1119
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,350
He's the juice!

1120
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,190
Wait, there's...

1121
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,350
There's some armor over there.

1122
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,870
He loves Mountain Dew, that guy.

1123
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,710
He drank too much of the juice.

1124
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:43,930
You think I can get it?

1125
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,310
Ouch.

1126
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,130
Maybe it wasn't worth it.

1127
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:49,810
Hahaha.

1128
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,160
I hear a critter.

1129
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,660
Ouch.

1130
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,710
I'm sneaking?

1131
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:14,110
Woof!

1132
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:14,790
That was close.

1133
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,350
All clear, sure.

1134
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,090
All clear.

1135
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:18,850
Sure.

1136
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:19,790
Exactly.

1137
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,470
Exactly.

1138
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:23,930
Exactly.

1139
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:24,970
All clear.

1140
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,670
All clear.

1141
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,270
Do I need to destroy this one, too?

1142
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:36,970
Alright.

1143
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,490
Stealth archery.

1144
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:41,730
Yeah!

1145
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,090
Okay.

1146
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,790
We're doing so much better than before.

1147
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:45,450
Hahaha.

1148
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,710
I wish I could get some more...

1149
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:51,630
Some more bow and arrows, but...

1150
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,950
It is what it is.

1151
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,880
I hear something.

1152
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,620
Hahaha.

1153
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,380
This is an oblivion stream now.

1154
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,110
Who do you think is gonna win?

1155
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:16,690
Uh-oh.

1156
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:17,350
I hear bees.

1157
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,190
Wait.

1158
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,770
This is...

1159
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,110
This is pretty intense music.

1160
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:22,610
Uh-oh.

1161
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,150
Uh-oh.

1162
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,330
Sounds like someone's coming up.

1163
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,570
Oh, he's down there eating them.

1164
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,050
You see it?

1165
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,830
They're eating him!

1166
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,710
And then they're gonna eat me!

1167
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,450
Snark time?

1168
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,070
Oh my gosh.

1169
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,830
That's a great idea.

1170
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,630
Oh my god!

1171
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,960
What are they doing?

1172
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:56,690
They didn't do anything.

1173
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,070
Oh my god.

1174
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:11,770
Did they notice me?

1175
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,520
Uh-uh.

1176
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,640
Actually, since it's a crossbow, the ammo is called bolts.

1177
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,080
Oh.

1178
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,440
Um, actually...

1179
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:43,410
They're Um, no.

1180
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:43,590
Yeah.

1181
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,890
I...

1182
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,470
Oh, oh, oh!

1183
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,690
He was never... He was never there!

1184
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,760
I think we have to use the can or the tank to open that up.

1185
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,440
No, that's what it seems like, at least.

1186
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,840
He was never there!

1187
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,520
My snarks suck!

1188
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,240
They're stupid!

1189
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,040
It's not the best situation.

1190
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,900
But I will still save.

1191
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,220
They're cute?

1192
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,100
I guess that's true.

1193
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,840
Ooh!

1194
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,540
Ooh, isn't there...

1195
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,640
Okay, they're still giving me rocket ammo.

1196
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,060
Oh, golly.

1197
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,260
Colby, welcome to membership!

1198
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,100
Thank you!

1199
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:53,860
Thank you, thank you.

1200
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,360
Okay.

1201
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,500
I'm guessing I just... I'm gonna get this ready.

1202
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,040
I don't know why.

1203
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,890
Oh, shoot.

1204
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,690
Oh, shoot.

1205
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,290
Oh, my God.

1206
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,250
I'm so stupid.

1207
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:30,830
Uh, I'm gonna reload.

1208
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,510
Hold on.

1209
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,090
There's a tank?

1210
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,850
Can I use it?

1211
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,250
How do I use it, though?

1212
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,110
Like...

1213
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,450
Oh!

1214
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:42,610
Okay.

1215
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,000
No!

1216
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,240
No!

1217
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:56,440
No!

1218
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:56,620
No!

1219
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:56,800
No!

1220
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:56,900
No!

1221
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,360
Don't kill me!

1222
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:57,800
Don't kill me!

1223
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,160
I think you can use the cannon, too.

1224
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,540
If I did this.

1225
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,260
I'm gonna try one more time.

1226
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,860
Does it have, like, a cooldown on it?

1227
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,280
Yes.

1228
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,100
Yes, it do.

1229
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,000
Yes, it do.

1230
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:29,760
Oh, my God.

1231
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,020
Oh, and...

1232
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,360
Oh, God.

1233
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:35,800
It's...

1234
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,340
It's not good.

1235
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,240
It's not good.

1236
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,100
Guys!

1237
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,980
We messed up!

1238
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:40,940
Oh, my God.

1239
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,420
Oh, my God.

1240
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:43,660
Oh, my God.

1241
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,100
I messed up.

1242
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,400
I messed up bad.

1243
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,260
I messed up good.

1244
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,060
I messed up bad.

1245
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,600
I messed up.

1246
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,200
I messed up!

1247
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,520
I messed up!

1248
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:54,770
The tank is not good.

1249
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,310
The tank!

1250
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:03,070
No.

1251
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:24,990
Okay, I think that was the last guy.

1252
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,080
Dang.

1253
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:39,180
Guys!

1254
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,520
That was a lesson for us all, huh?

1255
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,000
It was a good lesson.

1256
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,040
It was a good lesson.

1257
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:51,340
Shoot.

1258
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:57,270
What do I want to use?

1259
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,110
His bees against him.

1260
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,010
Wait, what if I... Oh, no.

1261
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:07,840
Ouch!

1262
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,340
Ouch!

1263
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,340
Bees on bees!

1264
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,500
Bees on bees on bees!

1265
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,760
Bees on bees!

1266
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:32,920
Bees!

1267
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,840
Actually, I don't know... He's gotta be still there.

1268
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,080
That's him, right?

1269
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,540
What if we...

1270
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:40,560
Instead...

1271
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,780
Oh, this is my last one.

1272
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,260
Never mind.

1273
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,020
Bees on bees.

1274
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,620
Is he still there?

1275
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,460
Actually, I can't tell.

1276
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,720
If I die...

1277
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,900
If I die, I die!

1278
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,760
Oh, my God.

1279
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,300
Oh, my God.

1280
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,320
How did I...

1281
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,400
How did I avoid that?

1282
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,700
I really didn't.

1283
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,220
What the hell is that?

1284
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:11,600
Oh.

1285
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,420
Uh-oh.

1286
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,800
Wait, now they have turrets?

1287
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,320
I don't think I'm gonna live this.

1288
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,140
I don't think I'm gonna live this.

1289
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,630
Oh, my God.

1290
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:32,430
Alien turret.

1291
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,350
Wait, did that kill it?

1292
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,570
Did that destroy it?

1293
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,330
The alien turret?

1294
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:39,970
Oh, it did!

1295
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,430
It did!

1296
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:45,230
I'm so dead.

1297
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,110
I'm so dead!

1298
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,600
I'm bee!

1299
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:01,890
Let's see.

1300
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:02,870
How do I want to do this?

1301
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:09,290
Oh.

1302
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,850
I forgot that was my last one.

1303
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:12,590
He didn't see me.

1304
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,710
I wish I could throw c4.

1305
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:17,350
Can I?

1306
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:23,410
I killed his bees.

1307
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:26,990
Go, snark gull!

1308
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,270
Will he actually work for me this time?

1309
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,000
That guy's just running!

1310
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:40,980
That guy's not...

1311
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,240
I'm trying to figure out...

1312
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:00,760
Oh, okay.

1313
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,980
Okay, I'm gonna reload.

1314
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,900
I'm going to switch to this bad boy.

1315
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,880
I'm gonna try...

1316
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,500
and handle him.

1317
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,380
Okay.

1318
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,700
That's one guy down.

1319
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,720
All right, now I'm gonna try and rocket the other side.

1320
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,560
Holy shoot!

1321
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,540
Holy cow!

1322
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,700
I got bees after me?

1323
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:49,580
Oh!

1324
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,180
Oh, he already shot.

1325
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:54,500
Oh!

1326
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,340
We got it!

1327
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,060
Yippee!

1328
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:56,720
Yeah!

1329
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,260
We got it, we got it.

1330
01:05:59,260 --> 01:05:59,560
Okay.

1331
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,080
Nice!

1332
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,480
I'm just gonna go back to this guy.

1333
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,120
Ow!

1334
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:10,860
Oh, I thought you were dead.

1335
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,800
Am I shooting in between?

1336
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:13,860
Hold on.

1337
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,040
Was I even hitting you?

1338
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,300
I don't think I was.

1339
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,980
I don't think I was shooting him.

1340
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
I think I was missing.

1341
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,100
I think I was getting in between his legs.

1342
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,680
Can I open that?

1343
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:50,780
Okay.

1344
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,600
Okay.

1345
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,620
We're in the lambda car!

1346
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,040
Oh my gosh, you guys, we made it!

1347
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,300
Took us a whole hour in that level, but we made it!

1348
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,900
Oh my gosh!

1349
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,620
Oh my gosh, we made it!

1350
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,260
Any health?

1351
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:12,940
Anything?

1352
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,760
In here?

1353
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,800
In the car?

1354
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,220
Oh my god!

1355
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:27,980
Oh, that shot's it.

1356
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:28,240
Okay.

1357
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:39,950
I'm scared.

1358
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,230
Why is it so serious?

1359
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:44,530
Here we go.

1360
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,070
Can I get in?

1361
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:46,010
What's the car for?

1362
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,360
What's down here?

1363
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,620
What's gonna be waiting for me?

1364
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:05,860
Oh.

1365
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:07,620
Just some...

1366
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,720
Just some head crabs?

1367
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,000
Oh.

1368
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,340
That guy is...

1369
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,100
I see more.

1370
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:20,760
Oh my god.

1371
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,720
I see that one up there.

1372
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:26,580
Okay.

1373
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,060
I see health over there.

1374
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,260
Dog versus crab.

1375
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,660
What's down here?

1376
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,780
Can I go down here?

1377
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,660
What's down here?

1378
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:39,500
Anything?

1379
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,720
Can I get squished?

1380
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,300
Oh, is it...

1381
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,420
If you accidentally fall?

1382
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,640
What the hell?

1383
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:52,970
Mother Trucker, where the heck did he...

1384
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:53,910
Where did he come from?

1385
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:59,010
Where the heck did that guy come from?

1386
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:03,850
Oh my god.

1387
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:17,950
That area is coming up.

1388
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:18,950
You guys are scaring me.

1389
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:21,650
What do you mean by that area?

1390
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:25,650
What's gonna happen?

1391
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,630
I'm scared.

1392
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,290
Oh wait.

1393
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:30,890
There's a ladder.

1394
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,470
My bad.

1395
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:35,990
Oh my god.

1396
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:36,750
Where?

1397
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,670
I was trying to heal myself.

1398
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,010
Where did he come from?

1399
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:47,250
Okay.

1400
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:51,190
I guess it's fine.

1401
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,270
We've been in worse situations, huh?

1402
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:56,330
Maybe?

1403
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,010
Maybe?

1404
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,690
Yeah?

1405
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,050
Oh.

1406
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:05,130
Wait, what about...

1407
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,270
What's this area down here though?

1408
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,010
Does this go to anything or no?

1409
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,190
Who did this to you?

1410
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,900
But is this the area you guys are talking about?

1411
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:46,270
This looks like a boss fight.

1412
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:47,810
Oh.

1413
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:48,690
What was that?

1414
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,290
Oh no.

1415
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:53,710
Oh no.

1416
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,370
It's these guys again.

1417
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:55,410
Oh it's the...

1418
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,270
These snipers again.

1419
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:57,650
Oh my god.

1420
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:58,070
Oh my god.

1421
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:00,830
Come back.

1422
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:11,700
I'm too slow.

1423
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,980
I got him last time.

1424
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,580
I don't hear anybody.

1425
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,790
I thought they said forget about me.

1426
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,770
Why are you guys so obsessed, huh?

1427
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,390
Oh, I'm...

1428
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:39,750
Oh my god.

1429
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:40,750
I just noticed my bullets.

1430
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:41,950
Holy hell.

1431
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,890
Okay.

1432
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:43,750
No ammo.

1433
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:49,370
I might have to redo this one, but I guess we'll see how it goes.

1434
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,970
I'm just gonna like blow up some of these.

1435
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,410
Maybe I'll get a lady.

1436
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:02,230
In order to beat the puzzle, the game, you must solve this Sudoku puzzle.

1437
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,170
Nooo.

1438
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:04,830
Nooo.

1439
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:07,690
Evil.

1440
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,490
Evil.

1441
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:09,110
Evil.

1442
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,130
I thought I heard somebody.

1443
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:14,310
Oh my god.

1444
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,830
Got him.

1445
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:26,770
I'm scared.

1446
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:27,790
I feel like I should save.

1447
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:31,110
Thank you so much for the bird.

1448
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:31,690
Thank you.

1449
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,850
That was a pretty good shot though, isn't it?

1450
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,650
If I do say so myself.

1451
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:46,830
Felix, thank you so much for the pink.

1452
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:47,210
Hold on.

1453
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,690
Kind of left a lot of people behind.

1454
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,210
And they're not exactly going to ignore their last...

1455
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,910
Last orders.

1456
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:55,350
I guess that's fair.

1457
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:56,970
Take up.

1458
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,770
Thank you so much for the gifted.

1459
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,470
I guess thank you so much for the gifted.

1460
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:03,270
I thought I heard somebody.

1461
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:11,530
Reload please.

1462
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:13,390
Reload.

1463
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:14,370
Reload.

1464
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:14,850
Oh, there we go.

1465
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:15,530
Oh my gosh.

1466
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,010
Oh, I think I'm too low.

1467
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,130
Got him.

1468
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,710
Okay.

1469
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,350
What about anybody in here?

1470
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:30,150
This looks like a trap.

1471
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,890
Like if I destroy it, somebody's going to be behind here.

1472
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:40,960
Okay, okay.

1473
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,540
This is good.

1474
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,580
This is, this is better.

1475
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,480
This is better.

1476
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,240
This is better.

1477
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,080
This is better.

1478
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:49,660
This is better.

1479
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,680
I heard all their feet.

1480
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,340
I heard them.

1481
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,550
It's kind of ASMR.

1482
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:07,590
I kind of like it.

1483
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:17,930
How many are there?

1484
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,250
I want to destroy this, but...

1485
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:20,530
Okay, what?

1486
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:21,330
It's Q, right?

1487
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,030
Okay.

1488
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:40,060
Sorry.

1489
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,500
I'm scared.

1490
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:45,820
Oop.

1491
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,560
She's styling on me.

1492
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,780
Oh gosh, she snipes so fast.

1493
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,860
That's gotta be everybody.

1494
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:11,520
No?

1495
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,160
Probably not.

1496
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,220
I say that.

1497
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:13,960
Why did I say that?

1498
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,540
Why did I say that?

1499
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,000
Can I go down?

1500
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,420
Oh my god.

1501
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:29,860
I wanted...

1502
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,140
I was hoping that there would be a hole so I could get to the house.

1503
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,280
What was that light there?

1504
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,080
Oh.

1505
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,240
Oh, I think it's just a reflection.

1506
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,580
Kept you waiting, huh?

1507
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,620
Thank you, Venom.

1508
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:53,630
I hear no more...

1509
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,090
I hear no pitter-patter.

1510
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,190
This looks like an elevator.

1511
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:03,770
There is a way to the health.

1512
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:04,570
Yeah, there's gotta be.

1513
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,150
Is it this one?

1514
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:14,210
Surely they won't ambush me while I'm doing this.

1515
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:18,530
Nice.

1516
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,690
I'm also almost out of crossbows.

1517
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:23,490
This really sucks.

1518
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:25,790
This is really bad.

1519
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:30,990
I will save though.

1520
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,700
I did it without deaths?

1521
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,280
Was that it?

1522
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,520
Did we do...

1523
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,300
Was that all of them?

1524
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,100
All the girlies?

1525
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:42,660
I guess so.

1526
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,860
Otherwise, they'd be coming up on me, huh?

1527
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,360
Let's go.

1528
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:57,290
Good job getting through that part.

1529
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:58,370
Oh, that was it.

1530
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:00,490
Okay, let's go.

1531
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,670
Just in case there's any head crabs.

1532
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,640
Why are there so many things to blow up?

1533
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,300
Head crab?

1534
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,600
Where?

1535
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,000
Where?

1536
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,260
Oh gosh.

1537
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,500
Oh, I'm surrounded.

1538
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,220
I don't like it.

1539
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,580
Ah, I don't like it!

1540
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,580
Save.

1541
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:54,750
I already did, right?

1542
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,250
I'll save again, just in case.

1543
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,230
Oh my god.

1544
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,570
Okay, we got that guy.

1545
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:20,250
Jump scare!

1546
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,190
Bee jump scare!

1547
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,170
And there was another guy.

1548
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,430
I don't want to use my...

1549
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:26,070
Maybe bees.

1550
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,270
Bee versus bee!

1551
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,050
Oh my gosh.

1552
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:36,110
Maybe not bee versus bee.

1553
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,130
This gun is better.

1554
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:41,440
Ouch!

1555
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,760
Ouch, ouch!

1556
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:53,690
Oh my god.

1557
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:54,350
Another guy!

1558
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:57,950
Where are they coming from?

1559
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,030
These guys are so stinking annoying.

1560
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,490
Wait, you can...

1561
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:04,590
Oh, this you can charge?

1562
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,210
I think so, but...

1563
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:09,030
I mean, we only have 11 left, so...

1564
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:12,070
Oh, thank goodness.

1565
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:14,630
I'm running out of ammo and everything.

1566
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:15,630
This is so bad.

1567
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:19,530
Oh yeah, the thank you for the reminder on the right click for the shotgun.

1568
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:20,730
Thank you.

1569
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:22,250
I'm gonna save.

1570
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,750
Yeah, thank you for the reminder on that.

1571
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:29,510
More ammo next room?

1572
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:30,130
Oh, really?

1573
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,670
Okay.

1574
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:32,510
I'm trusting.

1575
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:33,170
I'm trusting.

1576
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:35,250
I'm trusting.

1577
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:45,950
Oh!

1578
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:47,130
Oh my gosh, Doctor!

1579
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:47,770
I almost...

1580
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:49,870
I almost blew your head off just then!

1581
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,070
Holy cow!

1582
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,070
I apologize, Mr. Freeman.

1583
01:19:56,290 --> 01:20:00,090
But I couldn't risk opening that door until I was sure you had scoured the area.

1584
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,550
This is the last entrance to the Lambda Complex.

1585
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:05,570
Every other has been sealed off to contain the invasion.

1586
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:11,630
When we realized that you might actually make it here, we drew straws to see who should stay behind to let you through.

1587
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:13,730
Obviously, I drew the short one.

1588
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,170
Aww.

1589
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,870
My colleagues are waiting at the tip of the Lambda Reactor.

1590
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,610
Waiting for you, I mean.

1591
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:19,230
For me?

1592
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:22,910
The reactor is shut down right now, but you could activate it on your way up.

1593
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:26,450
You'll have to flood the core anyway to get into the teleportation labs.

1594
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:28,850
You're not authorized to know about those.

1595
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:29,310
Oh.

1596
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:33,450
But I can see you already know a great deal more than any one man is supposed to.

1597
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:34,290
Uh, clearly.

1598
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:39,530
Well, actually, I know everything and nothing, I think.

1599
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:41,890
I fear...

1600
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,030
I know everything and nothing.

1601
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,690
I like this little table here for defense.

1602
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,010
That's pretty cute.

1603
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:51,750
Oh.

1604
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:55,170
We got ammo, but what was that ammo for?

1605
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:56,490
Not this.

1606
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,190
What was it?

1607
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:58,570
It was like spiky.

1608
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:01,750
Oh, it was more...

1609
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:02,750
More bolts.

1610
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:03,370
Oh my gosh.

1611
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:04,150
Thank goodness.

1612
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:05,570
Okay, hold on.

1613
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:06,370
Oh, you know what?

1614
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:06,810
Screw it.

1615
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:06,970
Whatever.

1616
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:07,970
I'm gonna...

1617
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:08,510
Sorry, guys.

1618
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,690
I gotta go use the little ghosties room real quick.

1619
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:11,490
I'm sorry.

1620
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:12,250
I'm sorry.

1621
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:15,270
But, um, you keep this guy company, okay?

1622
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:18,710
You keep him company and...

1623
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:18,790
Oh.

1624
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:22,970
Uh.

1625
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:24,750
Maybe he doesn't care for it.

1626
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:27,530
You keep him company.

1627
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:28,790
I'll be right back.

1628
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:29,390
I'll be real quick.

1629
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:32,050
Yay!

1630
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:33,970
Yay!

1631
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:35,690
We're back.

1632
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:37,270
We're back, baby.

1633
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:38,830
Thank you for all that super chat.

1634
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:41,030
Thank you guys.

1635
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:41,810
What was that?

1636
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,670
What did I just do?

1637
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:45,650
What was that?

1638
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:47,850
Oh.

1639
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:48,890
We're doing it now?

1640
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:49,330
Oh.

1641
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:49,730
Okay.

1642
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:54,860
Thank you, sir.

1643
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:56,200
Don't die now.

1644
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,800
Oh gosh.

1645
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,740
They're giving me...

1646
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,580
They're giving me armor and health.

1647
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,400
Are we about to do a...

1648
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,380
Are we about to do a bus?

1649
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,520
Okairi tadaima.

1650
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,300
Thank you.

1651
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,240
Oh, do I have to take it?

1652
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,220
What's over here?

1653
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,100
Test firing chamber.

1654
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,190
What was that?

1655
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:45,630
Oh!

1656
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,070
Are you in weapons research too?

1657
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:47,750
Oh my gosh.

1658
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:52,850
I built the gluon gun, but I just can't bring myself to use it on a living creature.

1659
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:53,590
The gluon gun?

1660
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:55,570
You don't look as if you have any trouble killing things.

1661
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:56,050
Oh.

1662
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:56,550
Yeah.

1663
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:58,530
Oh!

1664
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,290
New gun?

1665
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:02,710
New gun?

1666
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:03,110
Oh wait.

1667
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:04,930
This thing also uses the same as...

1668
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:06,990
The same as...

1669
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:07,250
Oh wait.

1670
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,630
Oh.

1671
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:08,710
This is the gluon.

1672
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,210
This is the same as that one.

1673
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:12,030
Interesting.

1674
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,470
Oh, what the hell?

1675
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:27,070
Can I redo?

1676
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,530
I have to hold it.

1677
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:30,910
Oh.

1678
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,450
I ended up getting hurt for nothing.

1679
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,410
It's kind of lame.

1680
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,240
Oh, but it uses...

1681
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,660
I feel like I'm wasting a lot of it.

1682
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,320
No?

1683
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,340
I wish there was more ammo.

1684
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,500
Mister, you got any more?

1685
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:02,610
You got any more ammo?

1686
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,250
It's the best weapon in the game.

1687
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:05,870
Oh, hell yeah.

1688
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,530
Yeah, I'm like a head crab.

1689
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:09,090
I know.

1690
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:13,270
Hold on.

1691
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:13,910
I'm gonna reload.

1692
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,910
And we're just gonna grab it again.

1693
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:19,070
But I'm not even gonna do the test.

1694
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:21,410
I'm just gonna grab it and go.

1695
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:23,330
Thank you.

1696
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,630
Were you in weapons research too?

1697
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,230
Thank you.

1698
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,150
Thank you.

1699
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:30,310
But I just can't prove myself to use it on a living creature.

1700
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:32,990
No, because if you have any trouble killing things.

1701
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:34,370
Okay.

1702
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:35,650
Thank you, sir.

1703
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,010
Don't press those buttons.

1704
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,490
Do not press those buttons.

1705
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:40,690
Don't do it.

1706
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,890
You hold down the right click, it makes an animation.

1707
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:48,690
Like while it's firing or...

1708
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:54,230
Here we go.

1709
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,350
Oh no, just normally?

1710
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,610
Oh, it's like...

1711
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,310
Doing a little shaky.

1712
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,980
Or no, I'm doing that.

1713
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,140
I'm holding down right.

1714
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:12,780
Nothing's happening.

1715
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:14,240
Ssss.

1716
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,340
Uh oh.

1717
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:25,690
Oh.

1718
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,030
Oh.

1719
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:31,250
Oh.

1720
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:32,170
Oh gosh.

1721
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:32,650
Okay.

1722
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:38,730
Oh my god.

1723
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:41,890
I like how they say die.

1724
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:43,330
All right.

1725
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:43,790
Hold on.

1726
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,370
I'm gonna equip not this.

1727
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:47,270
We'll use it for...

1728
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:49,990
We're special situations, right?

1729
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:54,790
Oh my god.

1730
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:56,470
Where the hell did you come from?

1731
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:57,770
You asshole.

1732
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:58,630
Oops, wrong gun.

1733
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,730
Wrong gun.

1734
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,190
Oops, oops.

1735
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:08,430
Seriously?

1736
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,340
This sounds so bad.

1737
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,880
There sounds like something everywhere.

1738
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,380
Okay, I'm gonna test it out on this guy.

1739
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,880
I'm gonna test it out on this guy.

1740
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:34,900
You missed the first shot.

1741
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:35,460
I know.

1742
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:36,860
I know.

1743
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:38,940
He was like about here.

1744
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:48,330
Wowie powie.

1745
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,180
Holy cow.

1746
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,040
He's going to obliterate me.

1747
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,180
He's going to obliterate me.

1748
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,140
I'm gonna die.

1749
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,760
I'm gonna die.

1750
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:10,560
Oh my god.

1751
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,640
No, not like this.

1752
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:12,880
Not like this.

1753
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,400
Not like this.

1754
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,300
That wasn't good.

1755
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,280
That wasn't very...

1756
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,160
That wasn't nice.

1757
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:36,580
That wasn't very nice.

1758
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:40,860
Thumbs away!

1759
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,320
Can I get him from here?

1760
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,180
Oh, oh my god.

1761
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,900
No kidding.

1762
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,260
What the bees?

1763
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:08,880
Oh, I forgot.

1764
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,440
Oh my god.

1765
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,240
No, no, no, no.

1766
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,540
No, no.

1767
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:12,960
Please.

1768
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,380
Please let me out.

1769
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,300
Please let me out.

1770
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:18,380
Actually, I lied.

1771
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:19,040
I don't want to...

1772
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,520
I don't want to leave.

1773
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:24,640
Please.

1774
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:28,780
Oh my god.

1775
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,560
Locked yourself in a murder cage.

1776
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:40,690
What is this hell?

1777
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,950
What is this hell?

1778
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:46,310
This is where I can't...

1779
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:46,930
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1780
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:50,870
What's going on?

1781
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,860
I guess we'll go maintenance station.

1782
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,740
Box reactor access.

1783
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:01,680
Okay.

1784
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:05,910
Barney!

1785
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:07,790
Oh my god.

1786
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:09,950
What are you doing here?

1787
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:12,450
Your luck has to change sooner or later.

1788
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,990
Shenzel Air, thank you so much for the tag gift.

1789
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:15,710
And thank you!

1790
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:17,830
Oh yeah, you would think, right?

1791
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:19,270
You...

1792
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:20,930
You would think, right?

1793
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:22,470
This is the evil room.

1794
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:24,750
Maybe not.

1795
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:26,670
Actually, I don't know.

1796
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:28,430
I'm just gonna save.

1797
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,730
Oh, scientist!

1798
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:38,030
You'll need to activate both pumps and flood the reactor.

1799
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:41,030
And then that access pipe down there will take you to the core.

1800
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:42,170
Time is short.

1801
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:43,150
Time is short.

1802
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:47,770
Oh my gosh.

1803
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:48,370
Let's go.

1804
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:52,210
They know that this area is kind of torturous.

1805
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,390
Okay, let's go.

1806
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:56,610
Please move.

1807
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:04,770
Alright!

1808
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:05,890
Alright!

1809
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,770
Now we're talking.

1810
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:10,850
Expansions in the future.

1811
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:12,170
Maybe.

1812
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:18,570
He's just talking to himself.

1813
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:20,330
Alright.

1814
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:21,590
I think if we...

1815
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:21,910
Alright.

1816
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:25,470
If I use this... Okay.

1817
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,090
I can finally afford a membership.

1818
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:28,750
I've been watching since the olden days.

1819
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:31,210
For the best we thought, also use a dork.

1820
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,650
Thank you, Benny!

1821
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,810
Thank you so much.

1822
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:35,890
Alright.

1823
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:42,210
Oh my god.

1824
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,330
I'm stuck on something.

1825
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,270
Oh, I got stuck on... Oh my god.

1826
01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:48,170
Let me help, let me help, let me help!

1827
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:51,330
Okay.

1828
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:51,950
Alright.

1829
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:53,870
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1830
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:54,590
Please.

1831
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,730
Hell room.

1832
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,010
It really is a hell room.

1833
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,500
I think... He was the... He was the big guy.

1834
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:04,400
The super gun.

1835
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:05,900
Maybe, yeah.

1836
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,200
There's one more guy.

1837
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:27,810
Okay, okay.

1838
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:30,910
Yeah, the one guy noped out.

1839
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:32,850
But I got him.

1840
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:33,470
Oh, wait.

1841
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:33,910
Where'd he go?

1842
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:36,550
Wait, where did he go?

1843
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:40,290
Oh, he... Wait.

1844
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:41,510
Like, you guys saw him, right?

1845
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:42,730
He, like, ran that way.

1846
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:43,970
I don't die.

1847
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:45,070
I didn't think I killed him.

1848
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:47,510
Health back.

1849
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:49,930
Oh, your sacrifice was not in vain.

1850
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:51,190
Thank you, scientist.

1851
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:55,230
I didn't see him die.

1852
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,130
Yeah, me neither.

1853
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:58,790
Oh, my serious.

1854
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:01,170
Okay.

1855
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:02,590
Well, we took care of that room.

1856
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:06,530
We took care of that room.

1857
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,330
And now I guess we go down...

1858
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:11,710
Is that where he went?

1859
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:12,710
What do you think?

1860
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:13,590
Oh, my gosh.

1861
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,000
Oh,

1862
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,400
I think I missed!

1863
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,620
Stop shooting me!

1864
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:41,190
Where did that guy even come from?

1865
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:44,010
I thought I took care of everything around here.

1866
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,300
I hear more.

1867
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,040
I guess you're... I guess they're never fully gone, huh?

1868
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:04,770
This is really nice looking water.

1869
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:08,190
Like, this looks like such a nice room, though.

1870
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:09,290
Like a nice swimming pool.

1871
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:20,670
I had a feel...

1872
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:23,290
The hallway was way too long for that to not happen.

1873
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:29,770
Screw it.

1874
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:35,090
I don't want to deal with you.

1875
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:39,780
Okay.

1876
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,180
It's quiet.

1877
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,660
It's quiet.

1878
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,420
It's not quiet.

1879
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,400
You know what?

1880
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:46,840
Screw it.

1881
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,480
Okay, we got him.

1882
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,020
Close quarters shotgun.

1883
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,540
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

1884
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,820
So what's going to happen when I activate this?

1885
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,820
Is it going to start flooding and I have to, like, run back?

1886
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,000
Actually, I'm just going to reload and then...

1887
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:45,460
No, we're not in the best position here, but...

1888
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:45,980
Oh gosh, we got...

1889
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,620
We were at a hundred ammo...

1890
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:48,780
Or a hundred arm...

1891
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,120
A hundred armor, a hundred health.

1892
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:52,920
Oh my god.

1893
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:53,420
No way.

1894
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:55,600
I don't want to deal with you.

1895
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,400
These guys are the worst.

1896
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,340
And they...

1897
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,800
They deal such a stupid amount of health, I fear.

1898
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,040
No!

1899
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,720
I shot him!

1900
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:22,020
No!

1901
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:27,100
Just a little nibble of my head.

1902
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,220
Oh, there's one down there.

1903
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:34,540
Wait.

1904
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:39,940
Nice.

1905
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:41,800
Shoot-in'.

1906
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:41,980
Okay.

1907
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:49,030
Oh, okay.

1908
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:50,150
I see how it is.

1909
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:51,190
Oh, there he is.

1910
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:02,970
Perfect.

1911
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:08,310
Mince playstyle appears to be conservative about ammo like most people are about health potions.

1912
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:10,310
I mean...

1913
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:10,650
I mean...

1914
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:12,590
They only give you a limited amount.

1915
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:18,950
Wait, do I have to go down there?

1916
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:24,770
Oh my god!

1917
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:26,150
Oh my god!

1918
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:28,730
Excuse me.

1919
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:38,070
Rude.

1920
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:39,990
Wait, do I have to remember this?

1921
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:42,750
Pump one, tank one, tank...

1922
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,410
Do I have to remember this?

1923
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:49,860
I see the lever.

1924
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,380
Okay.

1925
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,300
Okay.

1926
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:07,680
Pull the lever, crunk.

1927
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,640
Please, go down the...

1928
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:14,980
There we go.

1929
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:17,400
Okay.

1930
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:20,660
Did that do the thing?

1931
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:26,940
Do I just go to the other side now?

1932
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:32,030
Yes, you did it.

1933
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:32,270
Oh.

1934
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:34,350
Neato!

1935
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,690
I think so.

1936
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:39,090
Okay.

1937
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:40,150
Cool.

1938
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:41,050
Oh my gosh.

1939
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:42,530
I'm shrimping playing this game.

1940
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:44,170
Hold on.

1941
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:47,510
I'm like a shrimp right now.

1942
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,930
What if I go back to...

1943
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:56,170
Oh wait, I think I used all the ammo, but...

1944
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,310
Let me see if I go back here.

1945
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:57,930
Hey Barney.

1946
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:02,050
I think there was still some health left.

1947
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:07,750
Not much, but...

1948
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:07,870
Oh!

1949
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:09,310
Look at that!

1950
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,290
Hey Mr. Look, I did it!

1951
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:12,490
Okay.

1952
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,110
Shrimp phantom.

1953
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:18,710
Beep, beep, beep.

1954
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,370
I'm just a shrimp.

1955
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,040
This is messed up.

1956
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,360
This is actually messed up.

1957
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:29,560
This is actually messed up.

1958
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:33,620
Ouch!

1959
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:49,110
My HP!

1960
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:52,230
I'm not even gonna save.

1961
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:53,210
If we...

1962
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:54,250
If I have to do it again, I will.

1963
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,040
What does that mean?

1964
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,220
Wait, what?

1965
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:09,590
Okay.

1966
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:12,970
Seems bad.

1967
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:14,370
Yeah, seems pretty bad, huh?

1968
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:16,990
I'm gonna switch to my crossbows.

1969
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,670
Maybe this will be easier.

1970
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,030
And I'm gonna switch to...

1971
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:26,410
I don't...

1972
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:28,450
I can't use this gun for very much longer, so...

1973
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,460
Wait, I can use it ten more.

1974
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,840
Oh, shoot.

1975
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:42,260
And that's that!

1976
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:43,540
Whoop!

1977
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:47,040
Still got rockets, true!

1978
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:49,680
Where'd he go?

1979
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,360
Where'd he go?

1980
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:55,460
Wait, where'd he go?

1981
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,000
Oh my god, there's ropes!

1982
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,980
Wait, where'd he go?

1983
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:00,960
He died?

1984
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,020
I killed him?

1985
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,360
There's health over there!

1986
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,400
There's two packs of health!

1987
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:12,320
That's huge.

1988
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,000
Oh my gosh, that's huge!

1989
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,640
I got him with the crossbows.

1990
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:18,860
I'm just so good!

1991
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:26,400
Any others?

1992
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:28,740
I think I got him.

1993
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:34,570
All right!

1994
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:35,810
Onwards!

1995
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,290
Onwards and upwards!

1996
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:39,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

1997
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,280
That was...

1998
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:45,980
RUDE!

1999
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:55,490
Oop, there we go.

2000
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:56,270
Let's reload.

2001
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:00,090
My health!

2002
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,490
My health!

2003
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:03,750
My health!

2004
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,620
What's going on in here?

2005
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,640
Oh golly.

2006
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,760
So much for the health packs.

2007
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:18,820
Well, they helped enough.

2008
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:20,880
I for sure helped.

2009
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,520
Without them.

2010
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:24,880
Would have been done-zo for sure.

2011
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:26,420
Pump station.

2012
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,020
I imagine it's going to be similar to the other room.

2013
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,300
I'm just going to save, but like, new save.

2014
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:49,580
I imagine it's similar to the other room where those guys are going to pop out of nowhere.

2015
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:50,960
Like they're going to spawn.

2016
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:53,860
But then we also have...

2017
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:55,200
Why didn't I come this way first?

2018
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,780
This one seems harder because we got the tongue men's too.

2019
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:26,200
Wait.

2020
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,300
Oh, I thought I saved.

2021
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,200
Oh, I did save.

2022
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:28,500
Wait.

2023
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:28,820
Hold on.

2024
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,080
Hold on.

2025
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:30,880
You.

2026
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:34,840
Where was he?

2027
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:38,840
You guys see him?

2028
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,100
Anywhere?

2029
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:41,320
Where'd he come from?

2030
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:44,360
Plenty of HP.

2031
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,500
Where'd he come from?

2032
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:54,710
There he is.

2033
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:05,820
Nice eyes.

2034
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:07,140
I saw him.

2035
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:08,140
Because I'm wearing glasses.

2036
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:11,720
There's armor down there.

2037
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:19,780
Thank you.

2038
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:23,280
Thank you.

2039
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:23,960
All right.

2040
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:26,260
Pull the lever.

2041
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,720
And we skedaddle.

2042
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:29,720
Let's get out.

2043
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,100
Oh, it's moving now.

2044
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:50,140
Does that do anything?

2045
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,700
Or...

2046
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,020
No?

2047
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:53,620
Maybe not?

2048
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:57,720
Okay.

2049
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:05,420
I'm like so weary of things spawning, you know?

2050
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:06,980
Okay.

2051
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,380
Spawning behind me, I mean.

2052
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:14,280
We're not doing so high!

2053
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:21,020
I haven't played it a long time, but aren't small boxes with lightning on them breakable?

2054
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:23,180
With lightning?

2055
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,620
They are?

2056
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,620
The ones with the lightning?

2057
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:32,400
I thought only the wooden...

2058
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:32,920
Like this?

2059
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:33,620
Wait.

2060
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,500
This looks like...

2061
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,080
It looks like it means it'll explode.

2062
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,500
I think this just explodes.

2063
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,940
Oh, which I should have been shooting at it instead then, huh?

2064
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:53,760
They...

2065
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,520
Go...

2066
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,180
Boom.

2067
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:58,540
All right.

2068
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:00,540
So now that I'm here...

2069
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,580
And we did this...

2070
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:06,080
Do I go in here?

2071
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:10,600
Uh...

2072
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,380
Scientist?

2073
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,400
I pulled your levers.

2074
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:15,700
Scientist can heal you.

2075
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,420
Oh, that's all right.

2076
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,180
You're right.

2077
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:18,480
Hi, Barney.

2078
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,400
Hey, Barney, Barney, boy.

2079
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,480
Don't linger, Mr. Freeman.

2080
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,860
You've turned on the pumps.

2081
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:30,760
Now take the access pipe, flood the core, and get on up to the labs without delay.

2082
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:32,660
Can I...

2083
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:33,040
Can you heal me?

2084
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:34,540
Allow me to treat that injury.

2085
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:35,600
Oh, thank you!

2086
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:38,220
Oh my gosh!

2087
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:39,580
Thank you!

2088
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:40,060
Wow!

2089
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:41,880
He gave us so much health!

2090
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,100
Wait, you stay here.

2091
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:44,940
Yeah, you stay here.

2092
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:45,500
Dang!

2093
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:50,810
That was huge!

2094
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:53,930
I know.

2095
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:56,170
Wait, so I have to take the...

2096
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:57,010
Pipe?

2097
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:57,990
Is that what he said?

2098
01:48:58,330 --> 01:48:58,830
To where?

2099
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:02,950
What is he?

2100
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:03,830
Down there?

2101
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:07,150
Swim?

2102
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:08,910
Oh, there's a ladder.

2103
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,120
Oh, oh.

2104
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:18,740
Oh, thank goodness.

2105
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:20,900
I was about to be like, um...

2106
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:23,820
Okay, here we go.

2107
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:34,130
What do I hear?

2108
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:39,860
Okay.

2109
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,120
I'm not stalling.

2110
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:49,960
So...

2111
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,540
Do I...

2112
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:01,580
Okay, I guess I just...

2113
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:02,320
Open these up.

2114
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,220
The lightning guy.

2115
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:12,630
Okay.

2116
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:14,290
All right.

2117
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:15,150
And then we do this one.

2118
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:22,750
Go, go, go, go!

2119
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:24,510
Oh, that's not a guy.

2120
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:24,910
Oh, I see.

2121
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:25,370
I'm up there.

2122
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:26,410
Can I get him from here?

2123
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:31,850
I did...

2124
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:32,730
Oh, no.

2125
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:35,150
I...

2126
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:36,610
I did, and I did.

2127
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:37,550
I did.

2128
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:38,290
I did that.

2129
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:40,770
Is that the only guy?

2130
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:47,370
Oh, gosh.

2131
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:50,430
How do I know where they're going to...

2132
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:54,010
What is that?

2133
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:56,970
Okay.

2134
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:06,180
Oh, my...

2135
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:06,660
My health!

2136
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:07,220
Oh, my gosh.

2137
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:07,700
I'm dying.

2138
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,040
I'm dying.

2139
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:08,580
Holy crap.

2140
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:09,300
Uh-oh.

2141
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:09,720
Uh-oh.

2142
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:19,710
I didn't even notice.

2143
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:20,770
My bad.

2144
01:51:21,370 --> 01:51:21,870
Oh, no.

2145
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:22,490
That guy...

2146
01:51:22,490 --> 01:51:23,550
Oh, I did kill him still.

2147
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:23,770
Okay.

2148
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:27,010
Okay.

2149
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:29,990
All right.

2150
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:31,610
Let's just not stick around to...

2151
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:32,410
To admire.

2152
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,040
Oh, shoot.

2153
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:38,400
Ow!

2154
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:39,680
Oh, I got hit.

2155
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,000
Ouch!

2156
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:42,660
Ow!

2157
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:44,660
No, no.

2158
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:45,720
Please!

2159
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,520
Uh-oh.

2160
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,660
I'm at one HP again.

2161
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:52,640
I'm at one HP again.

2162
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:53,120
Okay.

2163
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,060
Yeah, don't hang around here.

2164
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:58,460
I didn't notice that they were, like, going around in circles before.

2165
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:00,880
Oh!

2166
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,280
Right in front of the door!

2167
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:08,700
Okay, okay.

2168
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:10,180
Okay, okay.

2169
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:14,880
Oh, my God.

2170
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:15,860
Oh, my God.

2171
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:16,520
Oh, my God.

2172
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,160
Did I get hit?

2173
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:17,860
I don't know, actually.

2174
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:21,840
Oh, my God.

2175
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:29,950
Please!

2176
01:52:36,230 --> 01:52:37,950
Watch your head, Gordon!

2177
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:45,530
This one's fast.

2178
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:49,110
Okay.

2179
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:54,720
Come in!

2180
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:04,270
Messed up.

2181
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:05,570
Messed up!

2182
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,660
Wait for it to come back around.

2183
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,120
Oh, please, please, please.

2184
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:37,980
Oh, I see it.

2185
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:38,680
I see it.

2186
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:38,940
Oh.

2187
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:42,400
Is it...

2188
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,820
It's...

2189
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:43,700
It's also ran...

2190
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:44,080
Oh, my God.

2191
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,440
It's not random, but...

2192
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:46,380
Oh, my gosh.

2193
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,040
All right.

2194
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:57,050
Oh, my God.

2195
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:58,310
Oh, please!

2196
01:53:58,510 --> 01:53:59,170
Stop, stop, stop!

2197
01:53:59,710 --> 01:54:01,870
Stop, stop!

2198
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,450
Holy cow!

2199
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:07,410
I only got hit a little bit, actually.

2200
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:08,490
So...

2201
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:09,770
Could be worse.

2202
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:10,670
Could be worse.

2203
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:11,330
Could be worse.

2204
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,270
Does it go through the door?

2205
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:16,530
Oh!

2206
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:17,010
Oh!

2207
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:17,690
Oh!

2208
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:18,210
Oh!

2209
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:18,690
Oh!

2210
01:54:18,690 --> 01:54:18,830
Oh!

2211
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:19,810
Scared me!

2212
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:22,170
Okay.

2213
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:22,810
Never mind.

2214
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,020
Surely nothing got past those lasers.

2215
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:33,160
And could get to over here to the reactor core.

2216
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:35,540
Surely!

2217
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:50,600
Why'd they give me so much stuff?

2218
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:55,960
Why'd they give me so much stuff?

2219
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:04,430
Up we go.

2220
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:23,170
I made it.

2221
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:24,390
I made it!

2222
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:28,910
More supply?

2223
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:29,750
Uh-oh.

2224
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:30,610
Oh, no.

2225
01:55:31,050 --> 01:55:31,970
More supply.

2226
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:33,170
Uh-oh.

2227
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:34,310
More supply!

2228
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:36,570
What's down here?

2229
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:38,010
Okay.

2230
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:40,630
All right.

2231
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:45,350
27-year-old scientist with PhD saying things like hot dog, ouchy, ouch, nido, and dog dog.

2232
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:47,350
Oh!

2233
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:48,290
Barney!

2234
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:51,890
Hey, Mr. Freeman.

2235
01:55:52,090 --> 01:55:52,470
Hi!

2236
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:53,710
Hi!

2237
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:54,690
Hello!

2238
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:56,470
Hello!

2239
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:57,270
Hello!

2240
01:55:59,190 --> 01:55:59,730
Yeah!

2241
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,750
You're doing well in here!

2242
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:09,880
Hold on.

2243
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:11,160
I want to see what's down here first.

2244
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:15,360
Is it just in case you fall?

2245
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,580
What's the point then?

2246
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:18,640
What's the point?

2247
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:20,180
Wait, can you make it to the other side?

2248
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:29,070
He's seen some shit.

2249
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:30,270
Clearly.

2250
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:31,810
Wait, can I jump over it?

2251
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:34,130
Push the crate?

2252
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:34,550
No.

2253
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,250
Tough with the pipe.

2254
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:39,790
It must be...

2255
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:40,330
I guess you can...

2256
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:42,050
I guess it's a shortcut from the other side.

2257
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,730
Yeah, I think it's a loop around.

2258
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:52,250
Shut the door, Barney.

2259
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:54,070
Oh my god.

2260
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:58,210
This is why I told you to shut the door, buddy.

2261
01:56:58,910 --> 01:56:59,190
Oh my god.

2262
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:07,200
Yeah, he listened to what I said.

2263
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:11,240
Oh gosh, they're just gonna be ambushing from now on too, huh?

2264
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:24,120
Oh, I'm reloading.

2265
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:24,660
Oh god.

2266
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:27,580
That's not good.

2267
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:34,660
I really just went up to his face and was like...

2268
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,720
All my health.

2269
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:47,880
Let's redo that.

2270
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:48,460
Okay.

2271
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,900
Let's just redo that part.

2272
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,500
And I'm gonna do it with my Karasbo instead.

2273
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:12,030
And then I think a second guy.

2274
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,470
Good job, Barney.

2275
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:15,290
Good job, Barney.

2276
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:17,530
Good job.

2277
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:20,590
Okay.

2278
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:22,210
And then there's still this guy here.

2279
01:58:22,850 --> 01:58:23,510
Oh my gosh.

2280
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:24,090
Oh my gosh.

2281
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:24,670
Oh my gosh.

2282
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:25,990
Oh my gosh.

2283
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:26,910
Oh my gosh.

2284
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:27,430
Oh my gosh.

2285
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:28,030
Oh my gosh.

2286
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:28,530
Oh my gosh.

2287
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:32,650
Excuse me.

2288
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:37,510
Well, um, I could have gone better, I suppose.

2289
01:58:39,370 --> 01:58:41,510
Nice shot, thank you.

2290
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:43,370
Alright.

2291
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,090
What is this?

2292
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:57,340
Oh, it turns on the... Turns on the gas.

2293
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:03,780
What the?

2294
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,880
That was a G-Man, no?

2295
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,860
Oh, can I get these guys from here?

2296
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:18,170
I'm guessing this is a... I'm guessing this is a glass.

2297
01:59:19,950 --> 01:59:20,950
That was him.

2298
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:22,470
Let's try it anyway.

2299
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:26,630
Never mind, it's not gas.

2300
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:28,570
Oh, okay.

2301
01:59:30,110 --> 01:59:30,630
Oh.

2302
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,930
Oh, no.

2303
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:38,890
I just made that harder for myself, huh?

2304
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:44,850
Wait.

2305
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:46,170
Where did you come from?

2306
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:49,170
Are they just respawning?

2307
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,880
I hear another one.

2308
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:58,160
Oh, man.

2309
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:01,460
They are endless, I think.

2310
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:01,840
Oh.

2311
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:03,340
I don't know.

2312
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:04,100
Can I get in here?

2313
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:12,580
Doesn't seem to be the case.

2314
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,520
Guess we gotta go around.

2315
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,460
Which, uh, let's go back to this.

2316
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:19,320
Hold on.

2317
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:21,200
I'm gonna have my secondary gun.

2318
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:23,740
As that.

2319
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:24,320
Okay.

2320
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,560
I don't know if it's good that I turn these on.

2321
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:30,360
Can I get through now?

2322
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:36,680
Oh, you can go through the yellow ball or the green ball.

2323
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:46,070
I don't know, but it's good that I took these.

2324
02:00:46,230 --> 02:00:47,150
Or I turned these on.

2325
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:47,750
Oh.

2326
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:48,330
Oh my god.

2327
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,910
Oh my god.

2328
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,530
Oh my god.

2329
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:02,220
Oh, wait.

2330
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:03,700
I think they're dying to it.

2331
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,040
Because I definitely didn't get that gun.

2332
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:09,200
Yeah, they died to the steam.

2333
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:09,880
So it's good.

2334
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:10,400
It's good.

2335
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,720
Yeah, I cooked them.

2336
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,940
It's so bad, I still can't differentiate the different sounds that the craters make.

2337
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:53,220
I'm still so bad at it.

2338
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:56,020
Reload?

2339
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:56,880
Oh, thank you.

2340
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,360
I want all that sweet, sweet health.

2341
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,540
Well, I guess I don't need it right now.

2342
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,020
Oh!

2343
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:15,800
The yellow orb goes here.

2344
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:19,120
Wait, the green orb goes there and the yellow orb goes there.

2345
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,780
Oh!

2346
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:35,110
Oh.

2347
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:40,110
Oh.

2348
02:02:41,050 --> 02:02:41,690
Oh.

2349
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:46,370
Am I okay?

2350
02:02:49,410 --> 02:02:51,590
Did I sustain the injuries?

2351
02:02:52,410 --> 02:02:53,010
Maybe not.

2352
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:54,490
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2353
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:57,870
Holy cow!

2354
02:02:58,030 --> 02:03:00,330
I have sustained a lot of injuries from the fire!

2355
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:01,250
Or from the steam!

2356
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:02,630
Oh my god!

2357
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:07,780
That's a lot of damage!

2358
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:11,240
I don't know when I last saved.

2359
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:12,500
Oh wait, I think I saved in there.

2360
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:16,800
I think I saved right before this, so we'll just run out.

2361
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,320
Okay.

2362
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:24,940
As long as they don't respawn.

2363
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:31,620
Steam, not even once.

2364
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:33,740
Oh, this is, this is the bees guy, right?

2365
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:34,960
Oh, look at this, unfortunately.

2366
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:36,160
Oh my god.

2367
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:37,820
Oh my god.

2368
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:38,480
Oh my god!

2369
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:39,720
Stop shooting bees!

2370
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:47,520
Oh my god.

2371
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,500
Stupid homing bees.

2372
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:03,380
Now he'll come back through and he'll die to the steam.

2373
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:04,620
Get steamed!

2374
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:05,120
Oh.

2375
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:06,480
Uh.

2376
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,540
Get s- Uh.

2377
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:14,600
Uh.

2378
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:16,560
Steam?

2379
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:21,860
Wait, did he?

2380
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:23,280
I can't tell.

2381
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:26,300
If he died on top of the other guy or not.

2382
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:31,120
I can't tell.

2383
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:35,260
Is that a valve steam reference?

2384
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:41,690
He made the dying sound?

2385
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:42,330
Oh, you heard it?

2386
02:04:42,490 --> 02:04:44,010
Okay, I'm trusting you guys.

2387
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:46,390
I'm trusting you guys.

2388
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:51,210
I only have six bolts left.

2389
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,500
It does look like two.

2390
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:01,480
Okay, I think we're good.

2391
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:04,940
Six shots.

2392
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:14,460
Oh, never mind.

2393
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:18,380
Okay,

2394
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:35,440
so I have to teleport in when there's something underneath.

2395
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:39,220
Or else I'll get squashed.

2396
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:40,420
Probably.

2397
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:43,940
What's down here, though?

2398
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,500
I'm guessing if I just fall through.

2399
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:47,020
Ah, okay, never mind.

2400
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:47,960
I can walk through here.

2401
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:49,980
Okay, good to know.

2402
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:54,440
Have you played Portal, Minto?

2403
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:54,940
I have.

2404
02:05:56,380 --> 02:06:11,800
I feel like Portal was definitely, like, one of my first, like, games that I played by my, like, that wasn't like a, like a visual novel or a, oh yeah.

2405
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:12,380
Ready?

2406
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:19,010
So, wait, how?

2407
02:06:19,330 --> 02:06:20,290
Oh, wait, that's right.

2408
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:21,770
You have to go through the opposite one.

2409
02:06:22,010 --> 02:06:23,330
And, wham!

2410
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:24,750
Okay, I'm on it now.

2411
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:28,590
And then I have to go into here.

2412
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:32,390
But you know what I mean.

2413
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:34,050
Oh.

2414
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:36,030
Oh, I made it.

2415
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:37,610
I made it in here.

2416
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:38,190
Oh, my God.

2417
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:40,130
Oh, I did it.

2418
02:06:40,710 --> 02:06:41,950
Oh, this spooked me.

2419
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:44,750
Let's go.

2420
02:06:45,290 --> 02:06:45,490
Let's go.

2421
02:06:45,490 --> 02:06:45,570
Okay.

2422
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:47,250
We did it.

2423
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:48,030
Oh, nice.

2424
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:49,870
Okay.

2425
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:50,550
Cool.

2426
02:06:52,450 --> 02:06:54,690
And we have an extra health, just in case.

2427
02:06:56,030 --> 02:06:57,170
Anything goes awry.

2428
02:06:57,370 --> 02:06:59,190
What about up there?

2429
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:00,750
Do I not need to get up there or anything?

2430
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,300
Pretty good shape, too.

2431
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:06,180
Oh, not bad.

2432
02:07:10,990 --> 02:07:11,430
Hmm.

2433
02:07:12,490 --> 02:07:12,930
Hmm.

2434
02:07:13,690 --> 02:07:13,990
Hmm.

2435
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:14,470
Hmm.

2436
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:21,120
Well, there is a downstairs, so...

2437
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:36,300
Oh.

2438
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:38,880
Doctor.

2439
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:44,360
Wait, could I have gone back and do that?

2440
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:45,800
Could I go back and do that puzzle?

2441
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,140
Or is it...

2442
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,580
Is that where I am right now?

2443
02:07:48,580 --> 02:07:49,980
You are here.

2444
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:50,940
Level C.

2445
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:53,060
C for creepy.

2446
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,640
The most confusing part of the game?

2447
02:07:58,800 --> 02:07:59,100
Oh, no.

2448
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,140
Is it because we have to...

2449
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,480
Zap ourselves back and forth between places?

2450
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:12,250
Oh, golly.

2451
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:17,680
Look at the code.

2452
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:18,040
Wait.

2453
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:18,480
Oh!

2454
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:20,520
247.

2455
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:22,040
I didn't even see it.

2456
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:22,740
It's dying.

2457
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:24,680
Oh my god.

2458
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:25,780
I didn't even see it.

2459
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:26,420
Oh.

2460
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:27,700
247.

2461
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:32,840
My gun is, like, perfectly in the way.

2462
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:34,600
For me to not see it.

2463
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:38,820
247.

2464
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:41,280
Wow.

2465
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:42,220
Oh, wow.

2466
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:43,700
Oh, wow.

2467
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:46,600
Oh my gosh.

2468
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:48,120
What is going on in there?

2469
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:49,020
Wait.

2470
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:49,400
Can I...

2471
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:50,540
Oh, I can get up here, I think.

2472
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,780
Oh, we can get above.

2473
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:54,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2474
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:54,320
Okay.

2475
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:04,710
Oh.

2476
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:06,190
Oh.

2477
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:13,470
Oh, gosh.

2478
02:09:13,630 --> 02:09:14,190
Don't fall in.

2479
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,210
Gordon, try it myself.

2480
02:09:17,570 --> 02:09:18,190
There we go.

2481
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:18,690
Nice.

2482
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:22,170
Oh.

2483
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:28,810
Is there anything else we need in here?

2484
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:30,410
It's just a little secret?

2485
02:09:30,410 --> 02:09:32,430
It's just a little extra area?

2486
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:33,970
Okay.

2487
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:34,990
I'll take it.

2488
02:09:37,950 --> 02:09:39,150
Free supplies?

2489
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:42,230
Sounds good to me.

2490
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:42,810
Okay.

2491
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:50,740
Alright.

2492
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:52,900
Very nice.

2493
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:54,800
Very nice.

2494
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,140
Okay, so let's go back to up here.

2495
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:58,560
Obviously.

2496
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:00,620
It's the only thing we can do, I think.

2497
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:01,900
I'm confused.

2498
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:02,640
Where are we?

2499
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:03,600
Um.

2500
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,160
I think you're asking the wrong ghost.

2501
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:10,560
Oh, so I went into port...

2502
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,220
What?

2503
02:10:14,250 --> 02:10:14,810
No.

2504
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:16,270
Because I went in through that...

2505
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:16,630
Oh, wait.

2506
02:10:16,730 --> 02:10:17,870
Each side is port two.

2507
02:10:18,230 --> 02:10:20,290
I don't remember going in through the...

2508
02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:21,590
So...

2509
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:22,490
Hold on.

2510
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:24,570
I went in through port two?

2511
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:26,850
Done.

2512
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:30,550
I went into three.

2513
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,650
Three.

2514
02:10:30,910 --> 02:10:31,470
Oh, okay, okay.

2515
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:33,450
So two, and then four, and then seven.

2516
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:37,030
Aha.

2517
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:40,550
I naruho do.

2518
02:10:44,590 --> 02:10:45,110
Oh.

2519
02:10:48,450 --> 02:10:50,390
I didn't consider...

2520
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:50,830
Um.

2521
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:51,370
You know what?

2522
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:51,810
Let's up.

2523
02:10:52,450 --> 02:10:56,170
I did not consider having to time the other parts.

2524
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:57,850
That's so evil.

2525
02:10:57,850 --> 02:10:59,170
Wait, this is so evil.

2526
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:09,930
But I don't even know which...

2527
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:10,110
Uh.

2528
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:12,350
So I guess that one?

2529
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,890
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2530
02:11:15,850 --> 02:11:16,330
Ah.

2531
02:11:17,790 --> 02:11:19,550
We'll be safe scumming here a little bit.

2532
02:11:19,630 --> 02:11:20,630
Where does one go?

2533
02:11:21,330 --> 02:11:22,030
I'm curious.

2534
02:11:25,050 --> 02:11:25,530
Oh.

2535
02:11:29,130 --> 02:11:29,610
Oh.

2536
02:11:29,610 --> 02:11:30,430
Let's see where one goes.

2537
02:11:33,490 --> 02:11:33,910
Oh.

2538
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:34,250
Oh.

2539
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:38,720
I didn't mean to use that on you.

2540
02:11:48,070 --> 02:11:49,710
Oh, it's this room!

2541
02:11:51,810 --> 02:11:53,170
With all the head crabs!

2542
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:53,810
Oh!

2543
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:03,850
Oh, do I have to go through here?

2544
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:05,130
I really don't want to.

2545
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:08,250
Uh, we can come...

2546
02:12:08,250 --> 02:12:09,730
I feel like we can come back here.

2547
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:10,950
Yeah, where we saw Jimin.

2548
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:11,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2549
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:15,150
Oh, are you kidding me right now?

2550
02:12:19,290 --> 02:12:20,690
Oh,

2551
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:25,620
you saw Jimin?

2552
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:27,240
BTS Jimin?

2553
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,140
Ugh.

2554
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:37,540
Yeah.

2555
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:42,160
Oh, I'm full on grenades!

2556
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:45,600
Oh, I'm full on grenades!

2557
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:46,900
Never mind.

2558
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:50,840
That one is so fast.

2559
02:12:57,570 --> 02:12:58,550
Oh, this is one.

2560
02:12:58,710 --> 02:12:59,430
Oh, I almost went.

2561
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:07,940
Nice.

2562
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:12,400
Okay, four.

2563
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:14,200
Oh, no!

2564
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:17,400
Holy...

2565
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:18,360
Holy cow.

2566
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:25,640
Wait, don't go through that.

2567
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:27,220
Seven.

2568
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:28,320
Seven.

2569
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:29,520
Holy cow.

2570
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:31,260
No!

2571
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:31,580
Oh!

2572
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:55,950
Strongest toes.

2573
02:13:56,270 --> 02:13:59,490
I can even imagine him, like, literally, like, gripping it.

2574
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:00,470
Like, so...

2575
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:02,910
Like, his toes are like...

2576
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:06,290
He's just like...

2577
02:14:09,710 --> 02:14:11,270
Oh, my goodness.

2578
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:12,350
Gracious.

2579
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:14,890
Okay, this part's gonna be a little tricky now, huh?

2580
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:15,470
Okay.

2581
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:15,830
Okay.

2582
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:15,950
Oop!

2583
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:18,290
Ah!

2584
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:19,010
Oop!

2585
02:14:19,450 --> 02:14:19,830
Oop!

2586
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:20,750
Oop!

2587
02:14:20,890 --> 02:14:21,090
Oop!

2588
02:14:23,410 --> 02:14:24,230
Where's the entrance?

2589
02:14:25,510 --> 02:14:26,210
There?

2590
02:14:27,010 --> 02:14:27,590
Oh.

2591
02:14:27,590 --> 02:14:29,710
Oh my toes are doing the work again.

2592
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:38,280
I came from... Okay, that's where the code was.

2593
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,440
I came from... There?

2594
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:47,600
Do I just go to... Or do I crouch and jump in here?

2595
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:52,460
I'm gonna die.

2596
02:14:59,220 --> 02:14:59,740
Okay.

2597
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:03,600
Oh gosh, I just noticed there's this thing too that comes down.

2598
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:08,980
Okay.

2599
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,200
Oh my gosh, please.

2600
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:10,740
Please.

2601
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:15,780
So I have to get to like two or... There's a button on one of the rings?

2602
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:16,580
Is there?

2603
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:19,500
Hold on.

2604
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:20,900
I'm trying to see if there's anything.

2605
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:24,980
We're on the worst carousel ever.

2606
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:33,390
Check the door number.

2607
02:15:33,490 --> 02:15:36,990
This is what I'm... Like, do I jump over to the... Oh, they do have buttons on them.

2608
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:38,530
They do have buttons on them.

2609
02:15:38,610 --> 02:15:39,170
Okay, okay, okay.

2610
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:47,600
We'll go to... We'll try to... Oh, why did I do that?

2611
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:50,880
Okay, just kidding.

2612
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:51,800
Just kidding.

2613
02:15:57,340 --> 02:15:57,780
Alrighty.

2614
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:03,300
Just a joke.

2615
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:04,380
A silly joke!

2616
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,080
Okay.

2617
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:16,280
And then that probably... And then two will lower it.

2618
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:17,440
And then we... Okay.

2619
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:17,760
Alright.

2620
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:18,000
Alright.

2621
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:18,960
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2622
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:19,520
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2623
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:20,260
Alright.

2624
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:21,060
Save that.

2625
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:21,440
Save that.

2626
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:23,300
We... Press the button.

2627
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:25,080
Now we go back... In.

2628
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:26,160
And we go to two.

2629
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:27,440
And then we go...

2630
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:30,300
Ooh.

2631
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:30,580
Whoop!

2632
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:31,880
Oh my God.

2633
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:32,380
Oh my God.

2634
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:33,040
Oh my God.

2635
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:37,620
Please.

2636
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:38,300
Yes!

2637
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:44,580
Yes!

2638
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:45,040
Alright!

2639
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:48,000
Who designed this?

2640
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:49,080
Alright!

2641
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:51,300
That's a great question.

2642
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:51,900
Who?

2643
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:53,220
Who?

2644
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:54,860
Oh my god.

2645
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:55,120
Oh.

2646
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:55,760
Oops.

2647
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,620
Oh, I am jumping.

2648
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:01,640
Guys.

2649
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:05,020
Guys.

2650
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:06,600
Oh no.

2651
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:10,400
My fingers hurt.

2652
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:12,800
My fingers hurt.

2653
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,140
My fingers hurt.

2654
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:18,020
My fingers hurt.

2655
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:23,140
It's okay.

2656
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:26,800
It probably saved when we came into this room.

2657
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:33,290
No.

2658
02:17:34,250 --> 02:17:34,850
Wait.

2659
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:36,090
Yeah.

2660
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:36,830
Yeah, yeah.

2661
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:37,870
There's a four minute difference.

2662
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:39,930
There's a four minute difference.

2663
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:43,090
There's a four minute difference.

2664
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:43,330
There's a four minute difference.

2665
02:17:46,110 --> 02:17:46,630
Right?

2666
02:17:50,510 --> 02:17:51,030
Okay.

2667
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:51,370
Okay.

2668
02:17:51,870 --> 02:17:52,330
Okay!

2669
02:17:52,790 --> 02:17:53,130
Okay!

2670
02:17:56,850 --> 02:17:58,990
I can't believe my fingers hurt.

2671
02:17:59,430 --> 02:18:01,330
This is why you don't have...

2672
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:04,110
This is why... We just have to press the buttons again.

2673
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:05,150
But it could be worse.

2674
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:06,590
Oop.

2675
02:18:06,590 --> 02:18:06,990
Oop.

2676
02:18:06,990 --> 02:18:07,210
Oop.

2677
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:09,490
This is why you don't have the quick save and the...

2678
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:12,730
And the quick load right next to each other, huh?

2679
02:18:14,190 --> 02:18:14,670
See?

2680
02:18:15,030 --> 02:18:15,710
Number one.

2681
02:18:15,870 --> 02:18:16,070
Easy.

2682
02:18:19,010 --> 02:18:20,450
Legit was sweating over here.

2683
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:21,310
Oh, the time!

2684
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,350
Why was it saying that?

2685
02:18:22,430 --> 02:18:22,810
Like...

2686
02:18:22,810 --> 02:18:23,570
I think...

2687
02:18:23,570 --> 02:18:24,730
Is that like...

2688
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:27,710
I don't know.

2689
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:29,670
I have no idea why there's such a...

2690
02:18:29,670 --> 02:18:31,790
A crazy amount of elapsed time between...

2691
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:32,330
I don't know.

2692
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:34,030
But, uh...

2693
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:34,650
It is what it is.

2694
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:35,070
It's okay.

2695
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:39,350
It's time between saves.

2696
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:40,450
Oh...

2697
02:18:40,450 --> 02:18:40,830
I see.

2698
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:41,950
Oh...

2699
02:18:42,570 --> 02:18:43,450
Alright, we're good.

2700
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:44,470
Okay.

2701
02:18:44,830 --> 02:18:46,310
Now we just go to number two.

2702
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:49,670
Easy peasy!

2703
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:50,570
See?

2704
02:18:50,730 --> 02:18:51,610
Just like that, guys.

2705
02:18:52,030 --> 02:18:53,570
It's like nothing...

2706
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:54,630
It's like...

2707
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:56,990
It's like we didn't lose any time.

2708
02:18:57,710 --> 02:18:58,910
I'm too good.

2709
02:18:59,270 --> 02:18:59,930
I'm too good.

2710
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:07,090
I'm too good.

2711
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:07,890
I'm too good.

2712
02:19:07,890 --> 02:19:08,410
I'm too good.

2713
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:09,790
I'm too good.

2714
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:12,530
First try for real, for real.

2715
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:13,330
Alright.

2716
02:19:14,310 --> 02:19:14,610
And...

2717
02:19:14,610 --> 02:19:15,470
Jump.

2718
02:19:16,310 --> 02:19:17,090
And crouch.

2719
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:17,590
Jump.

2720
02:19:17,850 --> 02:19:18,270
Nevermind.

2721
02:19:20,210 --> 02:19:20,610
Okay.

2722
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:23,010
And...

2723
02:19:23,010 --> 02:19:23,370
Jump.

2724
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:23,610
Oh.

2725
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:23,890
Oh.

2726
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:24,230
Oh.

2727
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:27,270
Oh.

2728
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:29,810
I'm just not even gonna quick load myself.

2729
02:19:30,150 --> 02:19:31,910
I'm just gonna let the game do it for me.

2730
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:36,380
Hey!

2731
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:37,760
We made it!

2732
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:41,100
Okay.

2733
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,340
Ikimasu.

2734
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:47,040
Oh!

2735
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:48,880
Now I'm on the other side!

2736
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:49,900
Oh!

2737
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:51,100
Oh!

2738
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:54,880
Okay.

2739
02:19:57,060 --> 02:19:57,840
Okay.

2740
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:58,500
What does...

2741
02:19:58,500 --> 02:19:59,840
Don't enter this one?

2742
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:01,700
Where does this one take me?

2743
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:07,660
Gordon Freeman more like Gordon Feetman.

2744
02:20:08,530 --> 02:20:08,920
Yeah!

2745
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:11,160
Try it.

2746
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:12,520
This one?

2747
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:13,880
Save then enter?

2748
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:14,280
Okay.

2749
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:19,400
Understandable.

2750
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,800
There's big badness going on in here too!

2751
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:34,940
Big badness everywhere.

2752
02:20:35,140 --> 02:20:35,440
Oh!

2753
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:35,740
Hello!

2754
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:40,520
Uh...

2755
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:42,660
Collateral damage!

2756
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:53,090
Anymore?

2757
02:20:54,370 --> 02:20:57,610
I like how politely they've just come crawling out.

2758
02:20:58,150 --> 02:20:58,490
You know?

2759
02:21:02,590 --> 02:21:03,790
Can't tell...

2760
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:06,090
If I killed something or...

2761
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:07,010
Those are the bees.

2762
02:21:09,970 --> 02:21:11,470
Are we going in the hole?

2763
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:13,490
Far in the hole!

2764
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:13,570
Ooh!

2765
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:14,350
What if I do this?

2766
02:21:14,750 --> 02:21:15,030
Oh.

2767
02:21:15,130 --> 02:21:15,450
Dang it.

2768
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:15,730
Okay.

2769
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:17,710
Oh.

2770
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:18,770
I guess we're going in the hole.

2771
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:19,870
Oh!

2772
02:21:20,630 --> 02:21:20,950
Uh...

2773
02:21:20,950 --> 02:21:21,570
I didn't do that.

2774
02:21:21,670 --> 02:21:22,410
That was definitely them.

2775
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:22,910
Wait.

2776
02:21:22,970 --> 02:21:23,810
There's a ladder here.

2777
02:21:28,030 --> 02:21:28,570
Oh gosh.

2778
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:29,230
It's so spooky.

2779
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:35,020
45% Thank you.

2780
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:39,900
I didn't kill him.

2781
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:41,960
It totally wasn't me.

2782
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:44,500
That would be crazy.

2783
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:46,020
Right.

2784
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:47,360
What a thrill.

2785
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:58,420
That don't sound good.

2786
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,180
That don't sound good.

2787
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:01,360
That don't sound good.

2788
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:11,900
Doctor!

2789
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:13,980
Hold on.

2790
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:14,940
Before I go in there.

2791
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:16,600
Is there anything in here?

2792
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:17,320
No?

2793
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:17,720
Okay.

2794
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:20,220
And Barney!

2795
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:21,100
Let me in!

2796
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:22,820
Let me in, mister.

2797
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:24,820
Let me in!

2798
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:25,320
Let me in!

2799
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:28,580
You finally found us.

2800
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:29,920
So this is the guy.

2801
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:31,720
We thought you'd never make it.

2802
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:34,760
This is the supply depot for our first survey team.

2803
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:38,440
Quite a few handsome specimens were collected from the border world.

2804
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:39,540
And brought back this way.

2805
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:44,200
Before the survey members started being collected themselves, that is.

2806
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:47,300
We suspect there is an immense portal over there.

2807
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:50,120
Created by the intense concentration of a single powerful demon.

2808
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:51,120
This guy is freaking out.

2809
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:53,100
You will know it when you see it.

2810
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:53,960
It's okay.

2811
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:54,400
Calm down.

2812
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:55,400
It's okay.

2813
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:56,200
You don't have to keep...

2814
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:56,840
He's twitching.

2815
02:22:57,380 --> 02:22:58,660
You better kill it.

2816
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:00,600
What am I killing?

2817
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:02,400
You owe us nothing, Mr. Freeman.

2818
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:03,900
But you've come this far.

2819
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:06,280
You know as much about these creatures as anyone.

2820
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:11,020
Enough to know that if you don't wipe it out, there won't be much for you to come home to.

2821
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:11,500
True.

2822
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:13,500
So...

2823
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:17,060
If you're willing, my colleague is waiting for you at the main portal controls.

2824
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,160
He will open the gates for you, Mr. Freeman.

2825
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:19,920
Do hurry.

2826
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:20,900
Okay.

2827
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:21,860
Don't forget to gear up.

2828
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:24,580
And I'll cover you while you're waiting for that portal to warm up.

2829
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:26,360
He'll cover me, Barney!

2830
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:30,660
Sweet man.

2831
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:31,880
Sweet barn.

2832
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:33,080
Sweet barn.

2833
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:33,460
Sweet barnster.

2834
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:35,620
Oh my gosh.

2835
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:36,240
Uh oh.

2836
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:37,560
Is this...

2837
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:39,700
Guys, is this like the final battle?

2838
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:41,300
Is this like...

2839
02:23:41,300 --> 02:23:42,600
What is this?

2840
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:44,660
There's everything in the world here.

2841
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:46,540
Is this the final battle?

2842
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:48,600
No!

2843
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:49,880
Aw man.

2844
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:51,120
Oh my god.

2845
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:51,580
What is this?

2846
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:53,760
What is this?

2847
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:54,300
What is all of this?

2848
02:23:58,280 --> 02:23:59,300
Oh my god.

2849
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:03,060
They were like, by the way, if you didn't get any of these guns, here you go.

2850
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,980
If you forgot to get them.

2851
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:11,070
What was that?

2852
02:24:11,690 --> 02:24:12,510
What are you doing?

2853
02:24:12,970 --> 02:24:14,430
I will understand soon.

2854
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:19,900
Almost done with the intro.

2855
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:23,400
That soon the game will begin.

2856
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:25,580
Reload your guns.

2857
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:26,500
Okay.

2858
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:31,600
This Mr. Freeman is a long jump module created expected for navigation in the world beyond.

2859
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:34,600
I certainly hope you received long jump training.

2860
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:37,580
Because once you're in Zen, you will need it.

2861
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:39,980
I would advise you to practice before crossing over.

2862
02:24:41,340 --> 02:24:41,940
I...

2863
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:42,680
I...

2864
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:43,360
I...

2865
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:44,620
Just now...

2866
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:47,140
I...

2867
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:48,780
Just now I'm getting the...

2868
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:51,960
The...

2869
02:24:52,780 --> 02:24:53,820
No kidding.

2870
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:54,440
Wait, wait, wait.

2871
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:55,100
I'm not ready.

2872
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,460
Don't open the door.

2873
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:02,440
Hope you remember.

2874
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:03,180
Wow.

2875
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:04,400
They give you even more...

2876
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:05,940
They give you even more health.

2877
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:07,320
They give you health packs.

2878
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:09,060
So many health packs.

2879
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:09,860
And then...

2880
02:25:09,860 --> 02:25:11,360
Even more health.

2881
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:12,740
That's insane.

2882
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:15,800
I don't remember how to use it.

2883
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:18,060
Uh...

2884
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:18,360
Okay.

2885
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:19,560
I'm gonna reload everything.

2886
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,900
I'm gonna reload every...

2887
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:25,300
Oh, okay.

2888
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:25,960
It's reloaded.

2889
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:26,440
Just kidding.

2890
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:27,400
Reload.

2891
02:25:29,610 --> 02:25:29,900
Nice.

2892
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:33,000
That's good.

2893
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:34,160
That's...

2894
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:34,800
That's good.

2895
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:35,740
This is all good.

2896
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:36,400
Okay.

2897
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:39,240
This is...

2898
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:41,280
I still only have 11, but...

2899
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:42,240
I'm gonna save...

2900
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:44,240
And then I'm gonna...

2901
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,020
It's not...

2902
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:51,140
It's not doing anything.

2903
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:52,020
Wait.

2904
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:54,380
Why isn't it...

2905
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:56,400
Just run and crouch jump.

2906
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:57,080
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

2907
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:57,300
Come on.

2908
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:00,040
It's my birthday!

2909
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:00,840
What's up?

2910
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:01,560
Wasabi-san!

2911
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:02,320
Happy birthday!

2912
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,580
Jump while crouched.

2913
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:36,560
I was trying before, though.

2914
02:26:37,980 --> 02:26:38,840
Like that?

2915
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:40,920
Okay.

2916
02:26:41,360 --> 02:26:43,880
For some reason, it doesn't feel like it does much of a difference.

2917
02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:49,420
You guys are bad teachers.

2918
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:58,700
He's like, crouch!

2919
02:26:59,020 --> 02:26:59,700
And jump!

2920
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:06,200
I'll notice a difference in Zen.

2921
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:07,640
Alright, well...

2922
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,280
I guess this is it.

2923
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:13,500
Am I in Zen?

2924
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,740
Do you feel...

2925
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:29,220
Feel Zen?

2926
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:36,710
Not really.

2927
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:43,600
There's a scientist up there.

2928
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:47,680
Is...

2929
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:48,420
Am I in Zen?

2930
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:53,700
Yeah!

2931
02:27:56,900 --> 02:27:57,360
Okay!

2932
02:27:58,620 --> 02:27:59,060
Wait.

2933
02:28:03,740 --> 02:28:04,960
I'll practice it up here.

2934
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:06,660
Might be better, huh?

2935
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:08,180
From like...

2936
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:08,760
Oh my gosh!

2937
02:28:08,900 --> 02:28:09,700
I'm kind of trying it...

2938
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:09,840
Okay.

2939
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:15,340
I messed up?

2940
02:28:17,580 --> 02:28:18,020
Okay.

2941
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:20,040
Hold on.

2942
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:21,220
I'm gonna save when I'm up there.

2943
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:22,100
It's dead.

2944
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:23,480
Okay!

2945
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:24,960
Okay!

2946
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:25,100
Okay!

2947
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:30,360
I thought I was gonna be in like...

2948
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:31,360
Zero gravity mode.

2949
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:33,140
I don't know why.

2950
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:38,360
I'm not playing though.

2951
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:39,920
I was lucky enough to get a membership.

2952
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:40,440
Ooh!

2953
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:41,260
Thank you!

2954
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:43,840
Thank you, Chris!

2955
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:43,860
Yes!

2956
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:44,920
Heh heh.

2957
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:46,520
I'm back...

2958
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:49,620
Um...

2959
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:52,540
Is there another place...

2960
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:53,560
I can practice?

2961
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:54,840
Let's see...

2962
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:56,020
Maybe...

2963
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:02,340
Okay!

2964
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:06,920
Oh!

2965
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:08,000
Understood!

2966
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:16,060
I have a friend who is so dense about this game that he made all the gang hate this game without knowing a thing about it.

2967
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:16,640
What?

2968
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:23,460
I'm assuming that...

2969
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:26,500
What the hell is that?

2970
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,140
Oh my god.

2971
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:29,380
What are those?

2972
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:30,560
Oh my god.

2973
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:31,260
What are you?

2974
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,180
Alien babies!

2975
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:35,860
Oh my god.

2976
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:37,260
I'm really bad at shooting at these guys.

2977
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:38,380
Holy cow!

2978
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:40,080
Hello?

2979
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:44,520
Oh my god.

2980
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:45,840
I'm not good at shooting at you at all.

2981
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:48,440
Kill the babies!

2982
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:49,920
Oh no!

2983
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:52,260
Mister, I'm not good at this!

2984
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:54,000
I need...

2985
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:54,600
Barney!

2986
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:55,680
Barney said he was gonna help me!

2987
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:56,220
Oh my god.

2988
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:56,800
Oh my god.

2989
02:29:57,640 --> 02:29:59,320
Barney said he would help me!

2990
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:00,960
You're almost there, Freeman.

2991
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,520
Put yourself in position.

2992
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:04,960
Barney said he would help!

2993
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:07,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2994
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:08,420
Woo!

2995
02:30:23,310 --> 02:30:24,170
I missed!

2996
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:29,620
She shoots!

2997
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:32,920
That's okay.

2998
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:34,600
I kind of want to redo that part anyway.

2999
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:35,540
Cause the babies...

3000
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:36,540
I want to practice with them.

3001
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:38,220
Maybe...

3002
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:39,580
Cross...

3003
02:30:39,580 --> 02:30:40,280
How...

3004
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:42,500
What would be good for these guys?

3005
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:45,360
Maybe the bees?

3006
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:47,000
Cause they can home in on them.

3007
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:48,880
Maybe the bees.

3008
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:50,800
I thought I saved also at the top of that.

3009
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:51,800
But clearly I didn't.

3010
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:53,400
Revolver?

3011
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:53,540
Revolver?

3012
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:54,800
Oh, Revolver would be good.

3013
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:56,840
Practice your long jump if you must, but hurry up!

3014
02:30:57,420 --> 02:30:58,860
Tanya, thank you so much for the vibe!

3015
02:30:59,040 --> 02:30:59,800
Thank you!

3016
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:00,400
Okay.

3017
02:31:00,760 --> 02:31:01,720
Now I'm gonna save.

3018
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:02,720
Okay, here we go.

3019
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:04,140
Ha ha ha ha!

3020
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:06,880
Revolver would be good?

3021
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:08,280
Alright, I'll try it.

3022
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:09,560
Here, I'll even have...

3023
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:11,040
I'll have this to switch between.

3024
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:19,200
I was so close!

3025
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:21,020
I went...

3026
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:22,880
Too far to the left.

3027
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:24,360
Ha ha ha ha!

3028
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:26,840
I don't have to jump from here?

3029
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,560
Oh, I guess I could jump down there too, no?

3030
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:29,200
Alright, I can open the portal now.

3031
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:30,960
The process is complicated.

3032
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:33,540
And once it's begun, I must not be interrupted.

3033
02:31:33,620 --> 02:31:35,540
Or I will have to start all over again.

3034
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:37,740
Don't enter the beam until I give the okay.

3035
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:38,520
Understood?

3036
02:31:39,180 --> 02:31:39,780
I will begin.

3037
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:41,040
Yes, teacher!

3038
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,000
Close doesn't count.

3039
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:43,680
I know.

3040
02:31:44,060 --> 02:31:44,700
Ha ha ha ha!

3041
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:45,640
You're right.

3042
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:48,980
What does right click do?

3043
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:49,540
Nothing.

3044
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:49,980
Okay.

3045
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,360
I couldn't remember if I did anything.

3046
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:53,080
Oh!

3047
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,580
The first guy!

3048
02:32:00,530 --> 02:32:01,790
Oh, I shot him down!

3049
02:32:02,290 --> 02:32:02,890
Click out!

3050
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:04,030
I actually got him!

3051
02:32:04,810 --> 02:32:05,590
Oh my god!

3052
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:06,110
I got him!

3053
02:32:07,490 --> 02:32:08,430
Oh my god!

3054
02:32:10,210 --> 02:32:11,230
I got him!

3055
02:32:15,230 --> 02:32:15,950
Oh my god!

3056
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:16,770
And they still spawn.

3057
02:32:16,970 --> 02:32:17,170
Oh!

3058
02:32:17,290 --> 02:32:18,190
They keep spawning.

3059
02:32:18,610 --> 02:32:19,050
Oh shoot!

3060
02:32:20,150 --> 02:32:23,690
They don't stop spawning and they don't stop spawning and they don't stop spawning.

3061
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:24,730
Oh!

3062
02:32:24,930 --> 02:32:25,070
Whoa!

3063
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:26,730
Whoa!

3064
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:28,290
No!

3065
02:32:30,630 --> 02:32:31,110
Oh!

3066
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:31,350
No!

3067
02:32:31,810 --> 02:32:33,710
Get yourself in position.

3068
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:35,850
I got him?

3069
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:40,070
Oh my gosh, they just keep coming.

3070
02:32:40,770 --> 02:32:41,570
Here I go!

3071
02:32:41,930 --> 02:32:42,590
Oh, not yet.

3072
02:32:42,910 --> 02:32:43,310
Almost!

3073
02:32:43,310 --> 02:32:43,410
Almost!

3074
02:32:43,690 --> 02:32:44,330
Here I go.

3075
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:45,770
Here I am about to go.

3076
02:32:46,150 --> 02:32:46,450
Oh my god.

3077
02:32:47,070 --> 02:32:47,790
Can I go?

3078
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:48,630
It's ready!

3079
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:49,730
You must go!

3080
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:50,230
Now!

3081
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:58,500
Alright, I can open the portal now.

3082
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,200
The process is complicated.

3083
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:04,840
Once it's begun, I must not be interrupted or I will have to start all over again.

3084
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:07,060
Don't enter the beam until I give the okay.

3085
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:07,840
Understood?

3086
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:08,780
Yes, sir.

3087
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:13,200
I think I need to practice my job.

3088
02:33:17,740 --> 02:33:18,420
Oh yeah.

3089
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:19,600
Oh my goodness.

3090
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:23,860
There's a platform?

3091
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:25,160
Oh my gosh, you're right!

3092
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:25,820
There is!

3093
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:29,540
Oh, oops.

3094
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:33,440
Leave him alone!

3095
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,740
He's just an old man!

3096
02:33:36,500 --> 02:33:37,900
He's just an old man!

3097
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:39,820
Oh, I'm not doing so hot this time.

3098
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:42,420
Leave him alone!

3099
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:44,320
Leave him alone!

3100
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:48,640
That guy died in mid-air.

3101
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:51,220
Leave him alone!

3102
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:52,240
That's my grandpa!

3103
02:33:53,320 --> 02:33:53,800
No!

3104
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:56,000
Leave him alone!

3105
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:57,120
That's my grandpa!

3106
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:02,160
There.

3107
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:02,980
Okay, cool.

3108
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:03,720
Uh oh.

3109
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:07,300
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

3110
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:07,900
Platform.

3111
02:34:14,530 --> 02:34:15,730
Oh, that's it.

3112
02:34:15,970 --> 02:34:16,670
There we go.

3113
02:34:17,250 --> 02:34:17,590
Yeah!

3114
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:18,910
Hey, you must go!

3115
02:34:26,150 --> 02:34:26,750
Whoa!

3116
02:34:28,270 --> 02:34:28,750
Whoa!

3117
02:34:29,390 --> 02:34:29,630
Whoa!

3118
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:38,540
Um...

3119
02:34:45,350 --> 02:34:46,550
I'm in Zen.

3120
02:34:48,430 --> 02:34:49,910
This is what they meant.

3121
02:34:55,870 --> 02:34:56,250
Oh!

3122
02:34:56,490 --> 02:34:56,590
Oh!

3123
02:35:00,570 --> 02:35:02,530
I thought I overestimated it.

3124
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:04,850
Oh.

3125
02:35:05,370 --> 02:35:06,070
Oops.

3126
02:35:06,230 --> 02:35:06,650
Oh, sorry.

3127
02:35:07,950 --> 02:35:08,970
I can't wait.

3128
02:35:10,970 --> 02:35:13,650
That's part of the game, Zen-haters aren't welcome here.

3129
02:35:14,130 --> 02:35:14,250
Oh?

3130
02:35:17,650 --> 02:35:18,450
Oh, yeah!

3131
02:35:21,150 --> 02:35:21,930
What the hell?

3132
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,240
Why is it, like, shaking?

3133
02:35:28,700 --> 02:35:30,180
It feels like it's gonna fall.

3134
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:31,140
It's scary.

3135
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:34,160
Okay, let's go!

3136
02:35:34,980 --> 02:35:35,980
Hope you like platforming.

3137
02:35:35,980 --> 02:35:36,880
This is...

3138
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:38,360
This might take a bit of a...

3139
02:35:38,360 --> 02:35:39,100
You know...

3140
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:42,460
Oh my gosh, I barely made that.

3141
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:43,280
Holy...

3142
02:35:45,740 --> 02:35:46,700
No siree!

3143
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,360
Not on my watch.

3144
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:50,040
Uh uh.

3145
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:52,800
No ma'am.

3146
02:35:53,460 --> 02:35:54,420
No ma'am.

3147
02:35:58,770 --> 02:35:59,250
Um...

3148
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,350
What do I platform to?

3149
02:36:01,950 --> 02:36:03,170
What the heck do I...

3150
02:36:03,170 --> 02:36:03,850
That over there?

3151
02:36:05,250 --> 02:36:06,130
Oh my goodness.

3152
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:10,500
What do I...

3153
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:11,520
Oh, this one right there.

3154
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:14,680
I missed.

3155
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:20,100
I missed.

3156
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:23,700
The s...

3157
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:25,340
The very slow-moving platform.

3158
02:36:30,750 --> 02:36:32,830
Major fracture detected.

3159
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:33,430
Okay.

3160
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:42,520
I got it.

3161
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:45,760
I darn done it.

3162
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:48,100
I darn done it.

3163
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:49,920
Okay.

3164
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:51,600
Can I just jump to this?

3165
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:53,940
Oops.

3166
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:55,460
No!

3167
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:58,700
Okay.

3168
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:00,880
Maybe...

3169
02:37:02,060 --> 02:37:03,500
What is happening right now?

3170
02:37:03,500 --> 02:37:04,240
I don't...

3171
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:04,760
I have...

3172
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:05,140
Your...

3173
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:06,380
Your guess is as good as mine.

3174
02:37:10,820 --> 02:37:11,300
Hup!

3175
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:13,340
Oh!

3176
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:16,980
Save's coming.

3177
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:17,620
That's okay.

3178
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:28,800
Um...

3179
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:29,780
What's the next platform?

3180
02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:34,390
Is it that?

3181
02:37:34,490 --> 02:37:35,750
But I'm always just chasing it.

3182
02:37:38,030 --> 02:37:38,510
Uh...

3183
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:42,550
Uh...

3184
02:37:45,630 --> 02:37:46,730
I'm not quite sure.

3185
02:37:48,490 --> 02:37:49,570
Maybe it is.

3186
02:37:49,750 --> 02:37:51,570
Maybe I do have to jump over to there.

3187
02:37:59,220 --> 02:38:00,320
Just a little bit.

3188
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:02,040
But...

3189
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:02,800
That's okay.

3190
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:16,520
Oh!

3191
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:20,460
We'll take it, we'll take it.

3192
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:21,640
We take these.

3193
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,660
We take these!

3194
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:26,060
Um...

3195
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:26,440
Wow.

3196
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:28,920
It's so pretty here.

3197
02:38:32,380 --> 02:38:33,020
Okay.

3198
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:37,640
I'm mostly saving because...

3199
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:39,520
They...

3200
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:41,160
We have to like, kind of wait, you know?

3201
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:43,200
So I don't want to have to always be waiting.

3202
02:38:44,980 --> 02:38:45,620
Oh.

3203
02:38:46,380 --> 02:38:47,160
One damage.

3204
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:56,220
One damage.

3205
02:38:56,220 --> 02:38:56,440
Tipsy!

3206
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:03,040
One single damage.

3207
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:06,120
Let's see.

3208
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:07,460
I didn't even take damage this time.

3209
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:11,840
I didn't even...

3210
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:13,840
Where's the...

3211
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:14,320
Where's the platform?

3212
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:14,820
There it is.

3213
02:39:15,300 --> 02:39:15,540
Okay.

3214
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:16,460
You?

3215
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:17,380
Where?

3216
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:20,420
Oh.

3217
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:21,380
It's filled with dogs.

3218
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:22,980
Oh.

3219
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:24,100
And beams.

3220
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:27,340
Oh gosh.

3221
02:39:27,540 --> 02:39:27,680
Okay.

3222
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:30,280
Uh...

3223
02:39:30,280 --> 02:39:32,580
I'm gonna switch back to my revolver.

3224
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:36,000
Where are we going?

3225
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:36,600
Oh.

3226
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:37,780
Limbo!

3227
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:40,880
How can you go?

3228
02:39:41,980 --> 02:39:42,600
Alright.

3229
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:43,380
What else is there?

3230
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:44,680
Come here, dog.

3231
02:39:45,220 --> 02:39:45,720
Oh my gosh.

3232
02:39:46,580 --> 02:39:47,020
I'm...

3233
02:39:47,020 --> 02:39:47,420
Oh.

3234
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:47,780
Oh.

3235
02:39:48,340 --> 02:39:48,760
Ah!

3236
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:52,640
Okay.

3237
02:39:52,740 --> 02:39:53,600
I don't think that...

3238
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,360
What about these?

3239
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:58,040
Did I save when I got down here?

3240
02:39:58,120 --> 02:39:58,500
You know what?

3241
02:39:58,520 --> 02:39:58,840
It's fine.

3242
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:02,320
Um...

3243
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:04,560
We're limboing again.

3244
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:05,100
Oh.

3245
02:40:05,220 --> 02:40:05,760
I should crouch.

3246
02:40:06,220 --> 02:40:06,660
Okay.

3247
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:08,000
I'm good.

3248
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:13,560
I don't think I got that dog.

3249
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:14,840
I don't think I got that dog.

3250
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:17,740
Oh, but I didn't get zapped this time.

3251
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:19,900
Can I actually destroy this?

3252
02:40:22,380 --> 02:40:23,840
Let me try...

3253
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:24,860
This instead.

3254
02:40:26,860 --> 02:40:27,020
Hmm.

3255
02:40:27,020 --> 02:40:27,060
Hmm.

3256
02:40:28,380 --> 02:40:29,680
Can we shoot that dog?

3257
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:31,820
Hmm.

3258
02:40:39,620 --> 02:40:40,320
Bees gun?

3259
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:41,120
You know what?

3260
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:42,800
Honestly, that's probably the best idea.

3261
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:48,580
Oop.

3262
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:49,160
Oop.

3263
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:49,640
Oop.

3264
02:40:52,760 --> 02:40:53,320
Hahaha.

3265
02:40:55,060 --> 02:40:56,060
Get them dogs.

3266
02:40:56,540 --> 02:40:57,460
Oh, they're fast though.

3267
02:41:00,140 --> 02:41:00,700
Hmm.

3268
02:41:00,700 --> 02:41:00,740
Hmm.

3269
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:01,540
I wonder if they're too...

3270
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:03,100
I wonder if they outrun the bees.

3271
02:41:04,980 --> 02:41:06,200
I'm just gonna go on.

3272
02:41:06,660 --> 02:41:07,740
I'm just gonna go up.

3273
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:10,420
Um...

3274
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:10,700
No.

3275
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:12,800
Oh.

3276
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:17,900
Boo!

3277
02:41:21,380 --> 02:41:23,740
Oh, the lights turn off when I walk past.

3278
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:25,940
Look how cute!

3279
02:41:37,370 --> 02:41:38,970
Can't get me from behind here.

3280
02:41:38,970 --> 02:41:39,410
They're...

3281
02:41:39,410 --> 02:41:40,090
They're shy.

3282
02:41:41,710 --> 02:41:42,770
Just run.

3283
02:41:42,890 --> 02:41:43,630
That's what I'm about to do.

3284
02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:48,730
I'm gonna go into the magical puddle.

3285
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:51,910
It's healing me!

3286
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:53,090
What?

3287
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:56,730
No kidding.

3288
02:41:58,150 --> 02:42:00,210
The puddle of healing.

3289
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:01,770
I'll save here.

3290
02:42:06,170 --> 02:42:06,610
Ouch.

3291
02:42:07,050 --> 02:42:07,490
Hahaha.

3292
02:42:09,810 --> 02:42:12,190
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3293
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:17,540
Not...

3294
02:42:17,540 --> 02:42:18,780
Quite sure what to do here.

3295
02:42:23,450 --> 02:42:24,750
Is this like a little secret?

3296
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:33,200
Crouch tunnels.

3297
02:42:33,460 --> 02:42:34,040
Yeah, yeah.

3298
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:35,820
I noticed this one.

3299
02:42:37,080 --> 02:42:37,940
Secret tunnels.

3300
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:39,420
Okay, let's go find them.

3301
02:42:40,420 --> 02:42:42,340
Let's go find the secret tunnels.

3302
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:46,360
Whoa!

3303
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:47,080
Ah!

3304
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:48,800
I'm stuck!

3305
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:49,800
Oh, there we go.

3306
02:42:50,580 --> 02:42:51,600
Don't need this though.

3307
02:42:51,980 --> 02:42:52,240
Okay.

3308
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:53,780
Alright.

3309
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:56,080
Uh...

3310
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:57,600
Secret tunnel.

3311
02:42:57,960 --> 02:42:58,900
It has health in it.

3312
02:42:59,160 --> 02:42:59,900
But then what's the...

3313
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:01,020
What's with the pool of healing?

3314
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:02,320
Nothing.

3315
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:07,300
Secret tunnel!

3316
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:09,420
Whoa!

3317
02:43:18,510 --> 02:43:19,510
Oh, this is...

3318
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:20,290
This is gross.

3319
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:26,310
A weird place to put a health pack when you have healing water, right?

3320
02:43:26,310 --> 02:43:27,530
Unless you can like...

3321
02:43:27,530 --> 02:43:28,450
Hold heal...

3322
02:43:28,450 --> 02:43:29,290
Health packs.

3323
02:43:29,890 --> 02:43:30,490
Oh, we gotta let...

3324
02:43:30,490 --> 02:43:31,530
The butterflies free!

3325
02:43:40,250 --> 02:43:41,050
Oh!

3326
02:43:43,310 --> 02:43:44,230
The butterflies!

3327
02:43:47,530 --> 02:43:48,930
How do I get...

3328
02:43:49,310 --> 02:43:50,470
To the...

3329
02:43:50,470 --> 02:43:51,090
Over the...

3330
02:43:51,090 --> 02:43:51,850
Can I shoot this?

3331
02:43:52,870 --> 02:43:53,910
Maybe not.

3332
02:43:58,140 --> 02:44:00,200
The music is so pretty...

3333
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:01,900
Ouch.

3334
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:03,700
Okay, we're fine.

3335
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:04,000
Oh!

3336
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:09,000
I guess this isn't...

3337
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:11,520
This isn't goop that will kill you?

3338
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:12,720
Maybe?

3339
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:13,800
Maybe?

3340
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:15,920
It's not toxic.

3341
02:44:16,220 --> 02:44:17,360
Yeah, it doesn't seem to be.

3342
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:21,160
What do you require?

3343
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:24,000
Um...

3344
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:25,020
What...

3345
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:26,160
What do you require?

3346
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:28,980
Oh!

3347
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:30,180
Oh!

3348
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:30,760
Okay!

3349
02:44:30,760 --> 02:44:30,900
Okay!

3350
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:32,360
Oh, I got one?

3351
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:38,420
Number two?

3352
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:41,520
Oh, the butterfly!

3353
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:42,500
Oh, come here.

3354
02:44:42,980 --> 02:44:43,700
Oh, so close.

3355
02:44:43,880 --> 02:44:44,600
Come, but...

3356
02:44:44,600 --> 02:44:45,160
Come, little butterfly.

3357
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:47,260
Oh!

3358
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:52,440
All right.

3359
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:54,860
And...

3360
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:55,560
Whoop!

3361
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:57,100
Okay.

3362
02:44:58,040 --> 02:44:58,700
Little butterfly!

3363
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:02,600
I get butterflies in my stomach every time I see mint.

3364
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:03,400
Stop!

3365
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:07,100
Sure it's not, Abby, yes?

3366
02:45:11,870 --> 02:45:13,550
Should I save, or...

3367
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:15,590
Okay, I'm gonna save.

3368
02:45:17,790 --> 02:45:19,350
Okay, it looks like I go in that.

3369
02:45:19,790 --> 02:45:20,550
All right, here I go!

3370
02:45:27,260 --> 02:45:27,780
Oh!

3371
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:29,000
Gonark Slayer?

3372
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,240
Oh!

3373
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:35,040
The music's kinda funky.

3374
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:36,520
Why does it feel like Doom?

3375
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:39,640
Oh, did we just find Gonark?

3376
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:39,920
Oh!

3377
02:45:40,220 --> 02:45:40,820
Oh, ouch!

3378
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:41,360
Oh, okay.

3379
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:41,880
See you.

3380
02:45:45,380 --> 02:45:46,340
Boss dive!

3381
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:47,700
Holy cow!

3382
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:56,580
Oh!

3383
02:45:56,580 --> 02:45:57,340
Oh, I can't hide in there.

3384
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:57,740
Okay.

3385
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:58,240
Just kidding.

3386
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:01,940
Do I attack your sack, or...

3387
02:46:07,050 --> 02:46:07,990
Who was attack- Oh!

3388
02:46:08,990 --> 02:46:09,710
No way!

3389
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:10,630
No way!

3390
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:17,400
Does it make headcrabs?

3391
02:46:19,860 --> 02:46:20,480
Oh my god.

3392
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:21,180
Oh my god.

3393
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:21,520
Oh my god.

3394
02:46:21,660 --> 02:46:21,940
Oh my god.

3395
02:46:23,380 --> 02:46:23,740
Miss.

3396
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:24,280
Madam.

3397
02:46:24,620 --> 02:46:24,880
Mommy.

3398
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:30,540
Oh!

3399
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:31,220
Baby!

3400
02:46:31,780 --> 02:46:32,900
Oh, it's so cute!

3401
02:46:33,700 --> 02:46:34,460
It's not cute.

3402
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:35,320
It's not cute at all.

3403
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:36,040
It's actually...

3404
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:36,840
It's killing me.

3405
02:46:47,770 --> 02:46:49,170
Oh, I can't go in here just yet.

3406
02:46:50,310 --> 02:46:50,730
Woo!

3407
02:46:53,010 --> 02:46:53,450
Mama!

3408
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,430
Mama!

3409
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:01,690
Oh, what did I just grab?

3410
02:47:09,130 --> 02:47:10,470
Am I doing this right, guys?

3411
02:47:11,990 --> 02:47:12,430
Mama!

3412
02:47:12,430 --> 02:47:12,590
Mama!

3413
02:47:14,270 --> 02:47:14,630
Oh!

3414
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:15,250
Oh, shoot.

3415
02:47:17,990 --> 02:47:18,350
Yeah?

3416
02:47:18,670 --> 02:47:18,890
Okay.

3417
02:47:21,030 --> 02:47:21,630
Oh my god.

3418
02:47:22,550 --> 02:47:23,770
Don't attack me trees, please.

3419
02:47:25,710 --> 02:47:26,070
Woo!

3420
02:47:26,170 --> 02:47:26,350
Oh!

3421
02:47:26,470 --> 02:47:27,230
I just ran into her.

3422
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:31,010
Oh my god.

3423
02:47:31,090 --> 02:47:32,930
The little baby headcrabs are still attacking after me.

3424
02:47:34,390 --> 02:47:35,210
They're so persistent.

3425
02:47:35,350 --> 02:47:35,430
Oh!

3426
02:47:35,570 --> 02:47:36,450
She just ran in there.

3427
02:47:36,610 --> 02:47:37,250
Nice, nice, nice.

3428
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:42,760
Go after her.

3429
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:43,580
I'm going, I'm going!

3430
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:48,060
Are they still after me?

3431
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:48,980
Maybe not.

3432
02:48:00,130 --> 02:48:00,810
Oh my gosh.

3433
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:06,820
Why is this area so much smaller?

3434
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:08,980
Oh my god.

3435
02:48:09,160 --> 02:48:09,540
I'm trapped.

3436
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:09,960
Ow!

3437
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:10,420
I'm trapped!

3438
02:48:10,600 --> 02:48:10,820
Ow!

3439
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:11,100
I'm trapped!

3440
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:11,600
I'm trapped!

3441
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:16,140
Oh gosh.

3442
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:17,380
I just noticed the floor too.

3443
02:48:18,680 --> 02:48:18,920
Ooh!

3444
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:19,580
Ah!

3445
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:20,900
Oh my god.

3446
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:21,140
I'm trapped.

3447
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:21,780
Oh, I'm trapped.

3448
02:48:21,960 --> 02:48:22,140
I'm trapped.

3449
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:22,480
Please.

3450
02:48:22,700 --> 02:48:23,020
Please.

3451
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:23,700
Let me free.

3452
02:48:25,100 --> 02:48:25,660
Uh.

3453
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:27,820
Okay, um.

3454
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:51,490
Oh.

3455
02:48:51,850 --> 02:48:53,330
Okay, this is not so bad.

3456
02:48:53,690 --> 02:48:54,370
Oh, ouchy, ouch.

3457
02:48:54,430 --> 02:48:54,790
Yes it is.

3458
02:48:59,260 --> 02:48:59,820
Oh.

3459
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:01,140
Where did I go?

3460
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:04,580
Oh.

3461
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:05,780
Where am I?

3462
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:07,460
Hello?

3463
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:10,200
Hello?

3464
02:49:11,080 --> 02:49:11,640
Ouch!

3465
02:49:21,700 --> 02:49:23,500
What if an udder had legs?

3466
02:49:24,260 --> 02:49:24,880
I see.

3467
02:49:25,100 --> 02:49:25,280
Ah!

3468
02:49:25,900 --> 02:49:26,340
Please!

3469
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:30,380
Okay.

3470
02:49:31,980 --> 02:49:33,220
Thank you for the raid!

3471
02:49:36,020 --> 02:49:36,460
I'm...

3472
02:49:36,460 --> 02:49:37,060
Oh my gosh.

3473
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:37,740
Oh my god.

3474
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:38,380
Oh my god.

3475
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:39,720
I'm in a boss fight right now.

3476
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:40,880
So I'm a bit...

3477
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:42,100
I'm a bit...

3478
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:42,560
blessed.

3479
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:45,220
Thank you for the raid!

3480
02:49:47,240 --> 02:49:47,940
Oh my...

3481
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:48,080
Oh my...

3482
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:48,760
Where did you come from?

3483
02:49:56,560 --> 02:49:57,770
I see there's more...

3484
02:49:58,320 --> 02:49:59,280
stuff in here.

3485
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:00,540
There's a friend!

3486
02:50:01,180 --> 02:50:01,500
No!

3487
02:50:01,900 --> 02:50:02,980
Wait, what is the...

3488
02:50:02,980 --> 02:50:03,420
blue light?

3489
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:08,640
Save?

3490
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:09,800
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

3491
02:50:10,540 --> 02:50:11,100
I'm gonna save it.

3492
02:50:18,760 --> 02:50:19,600
Oh my gosh.

3493
02:50:19,660 --> 02:50:20,680
I just took health for that.

3494
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:21,840
Hold on, let me...

3495
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,480
let me just reload.

3496
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:24,820
Reload.

3497
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:25,700
Reload and reload.

3498
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:28,480
Cause a guy's gonna come down here.

3499
02:50:29,060 --> 02:50:29,660
Maybe?

3500
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:35,360
They live here!

3501
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:36,340
What?

3502
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:37,280
Oh!

3503
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:38,220
Sorry.

3504
02:50:40,380 --> 02:50:41,020
Reload?

3505
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:42,980
Reload.

3506
02:50:43,220 --> 02:50:43,420
Save.

3507
02:50:43,720 --> 02:50:43,900
Okay.

3508
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:44,960
Jump.

3509
02:50:45,220 --> 02:50:45,780
What?

3510
02:50:48,880 --> 02:50:50,060
Can I not jump here?

3511
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:51,160
Am I stupid?

3512
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:53,180
Okay.

3513
02:50:53,460 --> 02:50:53,960
There we go.

3514
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:54,420
Oh!

3515
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:55,280
It's a healing pool!

3516
02:50:55,620 --> 02:50:56,540
Oh my god!

3517
02:50:57,080 --> 02:50:57,720
Oh my god!

3518
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,660
How did I find this little hole?

3519
02:50:59,720 --> 02:51:00,540
I don't know actually.

3520
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:04,660
I don't know actually how I found this little hole.

3521
02:51:12,550 --> 02:51:13,910
She has so much.

3522
02:51:14,050 --> 02:51:15,550
Yeah, I just kinda fell into it.

3523
02:51:17,010 --> 02:51:18,930
She has so much HP.

3524
02:51:20,190 --> 02:51:20,910
Okay.

3525
02:51:21,310 --> 02:51:22,310
She's waiting for me.

3526
02:51:22,890 --> 02:51:23,990
Mommy dearest.

3527
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:33,830
The hole found you.

3528
02:51:34,150 --> 02:51:35,290
Oh my god!

3529
02:51:36,090 --> 02:51:37,170
Oh shoot.

3530
02:51:37,530 --> 02:51:38,430
That's awkward.

3531
02:51:39,650 --> 02:51:39,970
No.

3532
02:51:40,230 --> 02:51:40,670
There we go.

3533
02:51:49,150 --> 02:51:50,330
Hey now game.

3534
02:51:51,490 --> 02:51:52,430
Hey now.

3535
02:51:56,150 --> 02:51:56,990
Hey now.

3536
02:51:57,190 --> 02:51:57,410
Hey now game.

3537
02:51:59,030 --> 02:52:00,650
Suddenly it's like by the way.

3538
02:52:00,930 --> 02:52:02,430
You're gonna fall through every hole.

3539
02:52:03,690 --> 02:52:05,270
Careful not to save over this.

3540
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:07,970
Yeah, I know.

3541
02:52:08,130 --> 02:52:08,330
I know.

3542
02:52:15,420 --> 02:52:17,120
A little guy comes down.

3543
02:52:17,280 --> 02:52:18,140
I'm waiting for him.

3544
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:18,380
But...

3545
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:21,000
Okay.

3546
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:23,180
Can you shoot from under?

3547
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:23,520
Oh!

3548
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:24,020
There he is!

3549
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:28,600
Can I shoot from under?

3550
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:33,260
Oh!

3551
02:52:33,420 --> 02:52:34,920
I think it actually is doing damage.

3552
02:52:37,620 --> 02:52:38,060
Wait.

3553
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:39,180
Wait, you...

3554
02:52:39,180 --> 02:52:39,380
No?

3555
02:52:40,460 --> 02:52:42,180
I'm the type of gamer who doesn't look down.

3556
02:52:43,820 --> 02:52:44,960
Through the gaps.

3557
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:49,620
Like how big of a gap are we talking?

3558
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:50,600
Like this gap?

3559
02:52:50,760 --> 02:52:51,620
The one I fell through?

3560
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:54,260
I feel like I heard her making noise though, no?

3561
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:00,440
Like she was upset.

3562
02:53:02,500 --> 02:53:03,320
Like that!

3563
02:53:03,820 --> 02:53:04,260
No?

3564
02:53:13,820 --> 02:53:14,340
Oh!

3565
02:53:17,420 --> 02:53:18,420
We lost her.

3566
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:22,020
We lost her.

3567
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:28,260
I feel like if I sit in there, the head crabs will keep coming down at me, you know?

3568
02:53:29,460 --> 02:53:30,180
Okay, hold on.

3569
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:31,860
She leaves.

3570
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:33,560
She moves!

3571
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:34,320
She moves!

3572
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:36,400
She leaves!

3573
02:53:36,540 --> 02:53:37,160
She leaves!

3574
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:42,260
We can get her from right here.

3575
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:43,320
Oh!

3576
02:53:43,800 --> 02:53:44,240
Oh!

3577
02:53:44,380 --> 02:53:44,700
There he goes.

3578
02:53:46,160 --> 02:53:47,740
Mommy, your babies are stupid!

3579
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:53,300
I could use like a better gun for this.

3580
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:53,720
Let's see.

3581
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:54,220
Hold on.

3582
02:53:58,420 --> 02:53:58,900
Nice!

3583
02:53:59,200 --> 02:53:59,960
Chill out!

3584
02:54:07,380 --> 02:54:08,240
I don't know.

3585
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:09,280
Maybe not this one.

3586
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:10,600
Maybe a crossbow would be good.

3587
02:54:11,220 --> 02:54:12,060
And then...

3588
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:13,460
Let's do a crossbow.

3589
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:15,240
And then I'll have my...

3590
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:17,500
My pistol on the ready for...

3591
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:18,740
For these guys.

3592
02:54:18,740 --> 02:54:19,680
For you.

3593
02:54:21,300 --> 02:54:21,700
Okay.

3594
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:24,540
Wait, did I hear one behind me?

3595
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:27,980
I don't know, I can't though.

3596
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:30,060
I think one's sneaking up.

3597
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:31,600
No?

3598
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:32,380
Am I wrong?

3599
02:54:34,620 --> 02:54:35,400
Maybe I'm wrong.

3600
02:54:35,560 --> 02:54:36,020
Okay, just kidding.

3601
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:38,320
Alright!

3602
02:54:41,020 --> 02:54:41,420
SMG?

3603
02:54:41,720 --> 02:54:42,640
Oh, that might be good too.

3604
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:46,100
Let's cheese her a little bit.

3605
02:54:48,740 --> 02:54:50,200
No, this is actually working pretty well.

3606
02:54:50,580 --> 02:54:51,000
One...

3607
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:52,380
Two...

3608
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:53,240
Three...

3609
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:54,100
Four...

3610
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:55,740
Five...

3611
02:54:55,740 --> 02:54:56,780
Shoot tanky.

3612
02:54:57,200 --> 02:54:58,140
Shoot tanky.

3613
02:54:59,020 --> 02:55:02,820
Shoot tanky.

3614
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:04,280
Okay.

3615
02:55:05,320 --> 02:55:06,160
Come on.

3616
02:55:06,920 --> 02:55:07,500
Here we go.

3617
02:55:13,460 --> 02:55:15,100
And a one and a two.

3618
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:15,160
And a one and a two.

3619
02:55:25,120 --> 02:55:27,380
But she's gonna run away into that hole, no?

3620
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:29,140
That's where she's gonna go next.

3621
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:35,800
When she's low enough.

3622
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:37,000
No!

3623
02:55:40,060 --> 02:55:42,460
It does really just look like a big ol' teat.

3624
02:55:42,460 --> 02:55:43,240
It...

3625
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:46,280
Oh, gosh.

3626
02:55:50,680 --> 02:55:52,160
I have one...

3627
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:52,700
One more.

3628
02:55:52,980 --> 02:55:53,360
That's it.

3629
02:55:59,580 --> 02:56:00,380
Oh my...

3630
02:56:00,380 --> 02:56:00,960
Flashlight.

3631
02:56:03,380 --> 02:56:04,220
Um...

3632
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:06,680
Um...

3633
02:56:17,570 --> 02:56:18,530
Oh my...

3634
02:56:18,530 --> 02:56:19,010
God!

3635
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:32,400
Does she have iframes?

3636
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:37,140
Does she have iframes?

3637
02:56:37,300 --> 02:56:38,420
Because I feel like...

3638
02:56:38,420 --> 02:56:40,360
I would shoot her and...

3639
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:42,660
It's getting redder?

3640
02:56:42,780 --> 02:56:43,260
Is it?

3641
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:44,080
I don't know.

3642
02:56:44,500 --> 02:56:44,980
Are you sure?

3643
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,540
Are you seeing what you wanna see?

3644
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:52,600
Ah!

3645
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:58,580
Try moving back up.

3646
02:56:58,860 --> 02:56:58,980
Okay.

3647
02:57:04,310 --> 02:57:05,570
She's waiting for me.

3648
02:57:05,930 --> 02:57:06,130
Alright.

3649
02:57:06,390 --> 02:57:06,990
I'll try going up.

3650
02:57:07,090 --> 02:57:07,230
Okay.

3651
02:57:08,310 --> 02:57:09,350
Before I do that...

3652
02:57:09,350 --> 02:57:10,390
I see that guy right there.

3653
02:57:10,570 --> 02:57:10,970
I see...

3654
02:57:11,530 --> 02:57:12,270
Oh my god!

3655
02:57:12,430 --> 02:57:12,910
Stop it!

3656
02:57:15,330 --> 02:57:16,790
Trying to get that guy right there.

3657
02:57:18,190 --> 02:57:19,530
And this guy right here.

3658
02:57:20,410 --> 02:57:20,790
I can't...

3659
02:57:20,790 --> 02:57:20,950
Okay.

3660
02:57:21,010 --> 02:57:21,630
I'm gonna save!

3661
02:57:23,090 --> 02:57:23,530
Save.

3662
02:57:25,650 --> 02:57:26,330
And...

3663
02:57:26,330 --> 02:57:27,050
Uh...

3664
02:57:27,050 --> 02:57:27,290
Jump.

3665
02:57:28,350 --> 02:57:29,030
And...

3666
02:57:29,030 --> 02:57:29,570
Heal.

3667
02:57:30,670 --> 02:57:33,210
I'm gonna heal and then we'll go up there.

3668
02:57:34,690 --> 02:57:35,370
Alright.

3669
02:57:35,830 --> 02:57:36,010
Alright.

3670
02:57:39,910 --> 02:57:41,150
Get that guy!

3671
02:57:41,710 --> 02:57:42,210
Alright.

3672
02:57:42,470 --> 02:57:42,770
Alright.

3673
02:57:42,970 --> 02:57:43,310
Alright.

3674
02:57:43,530 --> 02:57:43,690
Alright.

3675
02:57:44,130 --> 02:57:44,650
Oh!

3676
02:57:45,190 --> 02:57:46,050
That's why I saved.

3677
02:57:47,350 --> 02:57:48,410
That's why...

3678
02:57:48,410 --> 02:57:49,310
I saved.

3679
02:57:49,510 --> 02:57:49,770
Baby!

3680
02:57:49,770 --> 02:57:50,270
Heee!

3681
02:57:53,650 --> 02:57:54,130
Oh!

3682
02:57:58,060 --> 02:57:58,540
Up!

3683
02:57:58,620 --> 02:57:59,160
Let me up please!

3684
02:57:59,620 --> 02:58:00,560
Please let me up!

3685
02:58:01,820 --> 02:58:02,300
Oh!

3686
02:58:10,060 --> 02:58:12,340
I need to stop falling through the hole.

3687
02:58:14,420 --> 02:58:16,380
I need to stop falling through the hole!

3688
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:18,820
I really need to stop...

3689
02:58:18,820 --> 02:58:19,800
I need to stop...

3690
02:58:19,800 --> 02:58:20,500
Please!

3691
02:58:20,720 --> 02:58:20,980
Jump!

3692
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:21,320
Okay.

3693
02:58:21,320 --> 02:58:21,860
Oh my gosh!

3694
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:22,280
Jump!

3695
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:28,680
Um...

3696
02:58:28,680 --> 02:58:29,420
What would be good?

3697
02:58:31,260 --> 02:58:31,980
Oh my god!

3698
02:58:32,200 --> 02:58:32,580
Uh...

3699
02:58:32,580 --> 02:58:37,040
Oh my

3700
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:43,860
god!

3701
02:58:43,860 --> 02:58:44,520
Oh my god!

3702
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:45,820
There's so many baby head crabs.

3703
02:58:45,820 --> 02:58:47,900
There's so many baby head crabs.

3704
02:58:48,260 --> 02:58:49,060
Oh my god!

3705
02:58:49,220 --> 02:58:49,300
No!

3706
02:58:56,280 --> 02:58:56,760
Oh...

3707
02:58:57,440 --> 02:58:57,920
Okay...

3708
02:58:57,920 --> 02:58:58,200
Oop!

3709
02:58:58,780 --> 02:58:59,060
Oop!

3710
02:59:02,930 --> 02:59:03,410
Oop!

3711
02:59:03,550 --> 02:59:03,650
Oop!

3712
02:59:03,870 --> 02:59:03,970
Oop!

3713
02:59:03,970 --> 02:59:04,050
Oop!

3714
02:59:04,170 --> 02:59:04,330
Oop!

3715
02:59:05,010 --> 02:59:05,490
Okay...

3716
02:59:06,130 --> 02:59:07,670
Maybe I should save here...

3717
02:59:08,370 --> 02:59:09,790
Instead of like...

3718
02:59:09,790 --> 02:59:10,770
You know...

3719
02:59:10,770 --> 02:59:11,090
Jump...

3720
02:59:11,090 --> 02:59:12,490
When I jump across...

3721
02:59:14,210 --> 02:59:14,810
Rockets...

3722
02:59:14,810 --> 02:59:15,750
I have five!

3723
02:59:16,130 --> 02:59:16,930
Let's try it!

3724
02:59:18,690 --> 02:59:18,950
Oop!

3725
02:59:29,240 --> 02:59:30,540
Taking a lot of damage!

3726
02:59:30,860 --> 02:59:31,300
Ahahaha!

3727
02:59:33,100 --> 02:59:33,700
Oh!

3728
02:59:36,040 --> 02:59:37,000
Oh my gosh!

3729
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:38,340
I thought I was cheesing it!

3730
02:59:39,280 --> 02:59:40,580
Let's go back to this one maybe...

3731
02:59:49,290 --> 02:59:50,190
Oh gosh!

3732
03:00:02,680 --> 03:00:03,160
Please!

3733
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:04,180
Don't kill me!

3734
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:05,000
Little head crabs!

3735
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:06,900
The babies are so annoying!

3736
03:00:07,060 --> 03:00:07,800
They're the worst part!

3737
03:00:08,280 --> 03:00:08,420
Oh!

3738
03:00:08,480 --> 03:00:08,780
Oh!

3739
03:00:08,780 --> 03:00:09,340
Oh my god!

3740
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:10,000
Oh my god!

3741
03:00:10,200 --> 03:00:10,580
She's going!

3742
03:00:10,700 --> 03:00:11,060
She's leaving!

3743
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:16,820
I almost had her!

3744
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:19,960
Oh!

3745
03:00:21,580 --> 03:00:22,920
I almost had her!

3746
03:00:23,520 --> 03:00:24,860
Did I die to a tree?

3747
03:00:26,140 --> 03:00:27,540
Did I die to a tree?

3748
03:00:31,460 --> 03:00:31,940
Okay...

3749
03:00:31,940 --> 03:00:34,060
Drop down the hole to heal in the water!

3750
03:00:34,180 --> 03:00:35,760
That's easier said than done, pal!

3751
03:00:36,520 --> 03:00:37,880
Buddy old friend of mine!

3752
03:00:38,040 --> 03:00:38,380
That's...

3753
03:00:38,380 --> 03:00:39,500
Much easier...

3754
03:00:39,500 --> 03:00:40,720
Said than done for me!

3755
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:41,600
Okay...

3756
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:42,040
Alright!

3757
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:42,800
Ugh!

3758
03:00:44,620 --> 03:00:46,420
If you haven't seen how many times I've...

3759
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:47,000
Okay, please!

3760
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:48,760
Please!

3761
03:00:48,980 --> 03:00:49,260
Stop it!

3762
03:00:50,300 --> 03:00:51,120
Stop it!

3763
03:00:52,740 --> 03:00:53,700
Stop it!

3764
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:54,780
Please!

3765
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:55,160
Stop!

3766
03:00:56,680 --> 03:00:57,660
Okay...

3767
03:00:58,700 --> 03:00:59,300
Huah!

3768
03:01:13,670 --> 03:01:14,650
Save...

3769
03:01:14,650 --> 03:01:15,330
Okay...

3770
03:01:15,330 --> 03:01:16,490
Now...

3771
03:01:16,490 --> 03:01:16,850
Go ahead!

3772
03:01:16,930 --> 03:01:17,670
Jump back over!

3773
03:01:18,830 --> 03:01:19,630
I'm gonna heal!

3774
03:01:23,490 --> 03:01:23,980
Okay...

3775
03:01:25,220 --> 03:01:25,920
Alright...

3776
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:26,270
Totally...

3777
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:26,880
Yeah...

3778
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:28,460
Totally intended...

3779
03:01:28,460 --> 03:01:28,760
Yeah...

3780
03:01:28,760 --> 03:01:29,060
Yeah...

3781
03:01:29,060 --> 03:01:30,980
Totally intended...

3782
03:01:37,710 --> 03:01:38,060
Oh!

3783
03:01:38,440 --> 03:01:38,980
Oops...

3784
03:01:38,980 --> 03:01:40,880
My bad...

3785
03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:41,240
Flip!

3786
03:01:43,680 --> 03:01:45,580
This guy gets me every time...

3787
03:01:45,580 --> 03:01:45,960
Alright...

3788
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:46,780
Alright...

3789
03:01:46,780 --> 03:01:47,560
Alright...

3790
03:01:47,560 --> 03:01:48,400
Alright...

3791
03:01:48,400 --> 03:01:49,740
I have 10 left...

3792
03:01:49,740 --> 03:01:50,980
So I'm just gonna go back to the...

3793
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:52,980
To the...

3794
03:01:52,980 --> 03:01:53,340
Huah!

3795
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:04,800
Run back and forth!

3796
03:02:05,180 --> 03:02:05,400
Haha!

3797
03:02:07,100 --> 03:02:08,220
Oh my god...

3798
03:02:08,220 --> 03:02:08,680
Not the tree!

3799
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:09,380
Not the tree!

3800
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:10,320
Not the tree!

3801
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:11,200
Thank you for the...

3802
03:02:12,140 --> 03:02:12,940
Thank you!

3803
03:02:14,220 --> 03:02:17,720
Thank you!

3804
03:02:17,720 --> 03:02:17,940
I'll...

3805
03:02:17,940 --> 03:02:18,660
Thank you!

3806
03:02:19,960 --> 03:02:20,560
Haha!

3807
03:02:24,730 --> 03:02:26,110
Should've written the balls!

3808
03:02:26,250 --> 03:02:26,710
Thank you!

3809
03:02:28,790 --> 03:02:29,390
Okay...

3810
03:02:30,810 --> 03:02:31,410
Uh...

3811
03:02:33,270 --> 03:02:33,870
Oh...

3812
03:02:33,870 --> 03:02:34,250
Oops...

3813
03:02:35,330 --> 03:02:35,630
Uh...

3814
03:02:35,930 --> 03:02:36,290
Go!

3815
03:02:37,490 --> 03:02:38,050
And...

3816
03:02:38,050 --> 03:02:38,890
Get in the...

3817
03:02:38,890 --> 03:02:39,750
There we go!

3818
03:02:39,870 --> 03:02:40,190
There we go!

3819
03:02:43,050 --> 03:02:44,190
There we go!

3820
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:53,240
Please leave!

3821
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:55,900
Please leave!

3822
03:02:57,040 --> 03:02:58,000
Oh, she's leaving!

3823
03:02:59,500 --> 03:03:00,580
Oh my god, finally!

3824
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:01,680
Ouch!

3825
03:03:08,580 --> 03:03:09,460
Oh god...

3826
03:03:09,460 --> 03:03:09,820
That's not good!

3827
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:10,400
Oh god...

3828
03:03:10,400 --> 03:03:10,540
That's not good!

3829
03:03:12,720 --> 03:03:13,680
Just kidding...

3830
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:14,400
Ha ha ha ha...

3831
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:14,560
Ah!

3832
03:03:15,240 --> 03:03:15,720
Ah!

3833
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:17,760
Wait...

3834
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:19,360
One second please...

3835
03:03:20,120 --> 03:03:20,960
Leave me alone!

3836
03:03:23,600 --> 03:03:24,080
Okay...

3837
03:03:24,620 --> 03:03:25,100
Alright...

3838
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:26,080
Now I have a second to think...

3839
03:03:27,720 --> 03:03:28,200
Okay...

3840
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:28,980
Um...

3841
03:03:28,980 --> 03:03:30,360
Do I need the heal?

3842
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:31,240
Because I'm at...

3843
03:03:32,640 --> 03:03:33,120
98...

3844
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:34,980
Frick them kids!

3845
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:36,580
Hahaha...

3846
03:03:38,180 --> 03:03:38,780
Probably...

3847
03:03:38,780 --> 03:03:39,840
Shouldn't have wasted...

3848
03:03:39,840 --> 03:03:40,660
Because I only have...

3849
03:03:40,660 --> 03:03:41,620
One...

3850
03:03:41,620 --> 03:03:44,440
I only have one left!

3851
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,040
That's like my last strong weapon!

3852
03:03:49,880 --> 03:03:51,100
C4 will help?

3853
03:03:51,260 --> 03:03:51,620
Okay...

3854
03:03:51,620 --> 03:03:51,940
C4...

3855
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:52,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

3856
03:03:52,560 --> 03:03:54,000
We do have C4 and grenades...

3857
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,360
You're right, you're right...

3858
03:03:59,970 --> 03:04:01,370
You get more ammo later?

3859
03:04:01,370 --> 03:04:01,830
Oh, I do?

3860
03:04:01,990 --> 03:04:02,750
Okay, cool...

3861
03:04:06,350 --> 03:04:06,830
Um...

3862
03:04:06,830 --> 03:04:08,370
We'll reload on this...

3863
03:04:10,110 --> 03:04:10,590
Uh...

3864
03:04:11,590 --> 03:04:12,070
Reload...

3865
03:04:16,460 --> 03:04:17,420
That's good...

3866
03:04:17,420 --> 03:04:18,040
Okay...

3867
03:04:18,040 --> 03:04:19,640
I'll just hold on to this...

3868
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:20,020
Alright...

3869
03:04:20,020 --> 03:04:20,720
Let's save...

3870
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:21,940
And let's...

3871
03:04:21,940 --> 03:04:23,360
Let's go, baby!

3872
03:04:23,940 --> 03:04:24,640
Here, I'll save...

3873
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:25,340
Actually, right here...

3874
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:27,000
Okay...

3875
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:30,900
How am I supposed to get down here...

3876
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:31,300
Without, like...

3877
03:04:31,880 --> 03:04:33,300
Breaking my knees...

3878
03:04:34,120 --> 03:04:35,300
I guess like that...

3879
03:04:38,460 --> 03:04:38,940
Okay...

3880
03:04:38,940 --> 03:04:40,280
There we go...

3881
03:04:40,280 --> 03:04:40,500
Oop!

3882
03:04:47,030 --> 03:04:47,290
Oh!

3883
03:04:47,530 --> 03:04:47,770
Oh!

3884
03:04:49,570 --> 03:04:51,410
This is not good...

3885
03:04:53,330 --> 03:04:54,810
That's not good at all...

3886
03:04:54,810 --> 03:04:56,150
That's not good...

3887
03:04:56,150 --> 03:04:56,350
That's...

3888
03:04:56,350 --> 03:04:57,210
Really not good...

3889
03:04:57,210 --> 03:04:57,650
Oh my god!

3890
03:04:57,770 --> 03:04:58,190
That's not good!

3891
03:04:58,970 --> 03:04:59,250
Ah!

3892
03:04:59,450 --> 03:05:00,110
That's not good!

3893
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:03,990
Oh god!

3894
03:05:04,230 --> 03:05:04,670
Babies!

3895
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:05,410
Babies everywhere!

3896
03:05:06,110 --> 03:05:07,810
I don't want...

3897
03:05:07,810 --> 03:05:09,050
Okay...

3898
03:05:09,050 --> 03:05:09,670
Um...

3899
03:05:09,670 --> 03:05:10,110
Oh my gosh!

3900
03:05:10,230 --> 03:05:10,390
Please!

3901
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:13,770
Please!

3902
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:14,470
Ah!

3903
03:05:14,970 --> 03:05:15,850
Crowbar!

3904
03:05:15,970 --> 03:05:16,490
I'm so true!

3905
03:05:19,070 --> 03:05:20,390
Stupid babies!

3906
03:05:25,570 --> 03:05:26,450
Damn!

3907
03:05:26,890 --> 03:05:28,470
They really don't stop coming...

3908
03:05:29,590 --> 03:05:30,470
Okay...

3909
03:05:30,470 --> 03:05:31,050
Alright...

3910
03:05:31,790 --> 03:05:33,150
Alright, mama...

3911
03:05:33,970 --> 03:05:34,370
Mama!

3912
03:05:34,370 --> 03:05:34,530
Ah!

3913
03:05:35,270 --> 03:05:36,290
Will this work?

3914
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:38,770
Time to find out...

3915
03:05:43,660 --> 03:05:43,990
Uh...

3916
03:05:43,990 --> 03:05:45,350
How do I get back up?

3917
03:05:46,430 --> 03:05:47,090
Like...

3918
03:05:48,430 --> 03:05:50,210
Am I trapped down here forever?

3919
03:05:51,770 --> 03:05:52,430
Oh...

3920
03:05:53,690 --> 03:05:54,350
Nice...

3921
03:05:57,590 --> 03:05:58,250
Um...

3922
03:05:58,250 --> 03:05:59,850
Let's use our grenades...

3923
03:06:03,410 --> 03:06:04,550
You don't...

3924
03:06:04,550 --> 03:06:05,610
Other than reloading...

3925
03:06:06,490 --> 03:06:07,790
Gotta unload on her...

3926
03:06:07,790 --> 03:06:08,370
Okay...

3927
03:06:08,370 --> 03:06:08,870
Oh...

3928
03:06:10,810 --> 03:06:12,550
I don't think so...

3929
03:06:33,380 --> 03:06:35,160
We are getting her...

3930
03:06:38,340 --> 03:06:39,700
Cock the grenade...

3931
03:06:39,700 --> 03:06:41,080
Then throw...

3932
03:06:41,860 --> 03:06:43,180
I'm scared...

3933
03:06:43,980 --> 03:06:44,940
Here, I'm gonna save...

3934
03:06:44,940 --> 03:06:46,100
I'm not gonna quick save...

3935
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:48,100
So it's like...

3936
03:06:48,880 --> 03:06:49,600
And...

3937
03:06:51,420 --> 03:06:52,140
Oh...

3938
03:06:52,140 --> 03:06:52,720
Where the hell?

3939
03:06:56,840 --> 03:06:59,160
Count to three...

3940
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:00,060
One...

3941
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:01,120
Two...

3942
03:07:01,720 --> 03:07:02,280
Three...

3943
03:07:21,490 --> 03:07:22,130
Oh no!

3944
03:07:22,330 --> 03:07:22,830
No, no, no, no!

3945
03:07:23,590 --> 03:07:24,890
Poor babies!

3946
03:07:25,250 --> 03:07:26,010
Poor babies!

3947
03:07:36,410 --> 03:07:37,890
Come this way...

3948
03:07:38,650 --> 03:07:40,170
They're kinda cute...

3949
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:47,680
Ooh...

3950
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:48,420
Golly...

3951
03:07:55,480 --> 03:07:57,080
She still let him fly!

3952
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:02,280
More!

3953
03:08:16,670 --> 03:08:17,210
Mommy!

3954
03:08:17,590 --> 03:08:17,810
Please!

3955
03:08:19,830 --> 03:08:20,910
Alright...

3956
03:08:21,190 --> 03:08:21,730
One...

3957
03:08:21,730 --> 03:08:23,350
Two...

3958
03:08:25,430 --> 03:08:25,970
One...

3959
03:08:25,970 --> 03:08:26,590
Two...

3960
03:08:26,590 --> 03:08:27,990
They do do damage, you guys!

3961
03:08:28,990 --> 03:08:30,330
They are doing damage...

3962
03:08:30,330 --> 03:08:30,770
They do...

3963
03:08:30,770 --> 03:08:32,430
They do damage...

3964
03:08:35,010 --> 03:08:36,990
They're so stinkin' annoying...

3965
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:41,990
Do do babies...

3966
03:08:42,590 --> 03:08:44,450
Please stop having babies!

3967
03:08:44,930 --> 03:08:45,610
Please!

3968
03:08:46,770 --> 03:08:48,470
I can't do this anymore!

3969
03:08:55,210 --> 03:08:57,270
Oh my god...

3970
03:08:57,270 --> 03:08:59,670
I do kinda wanna just unload on her...

3971
03:08:59,670 --> 03:09:00,290
Oh my god...

3972
03:09:00,290 --> 03:09:00,710
Please!

3973
03:09:00,910 --> 03:09:01,510
Leave me alone!

3974
03:09:02,170 --> 03:09:03,470
I was hoping that she would...

3975
03:09:03,470 --> 03:09:04,310
Get into that...

3976
03:09:04,310 --> 03:09:05,670
How she was before...

3977
03:09:05,670 --> 03:09:06,030
But...

3978
03:09:06,030 --> 03:09:06,930
That doesn't seem to be...

3979
03:09:06,930 --> 03:09:07,910
The case...

3980
03:09:09,890 --> 03:09:10,410
Uh...

3981
03:09:14,940 --> 03:09:15,460
Oh...

3982
03:09:15,460 --> 03:09:16,640
I'm out of ammo!

3983
03:09:16,960 --> 03:09:17,480
No...

3984
03:09:17,480 --> 03:09:18,660
Stinkin' way...

3985
03:09:20,200 --> 03:09:20,720
Uh...

3986
03:09:25,750 --> 03:09:26,630
Oh my god!

3987
03:09:27,790 --> 03:09:28,190
Oh!

3988
03:09:31,290 --> 03:09:32,450
Oh my god!

3989
03:09:32,570 --> 03:09:32,970
I'm stuck...

3990
03:09:32,970 --> 03:09:33,990
I'm stuck on the babies!

3991
03:09:36,830 --> 03:09:37,530
Oh...

3992
03:09:37,530 --> 03:09:37,890
Oh...

3993
03:09:37,890 --> 03:09:38,110
Uh...

3994
03:09:38,110 --> 03:09:38,470
Did we...

3995
03:09:38,470 --> 03:09:39,210
Did we...

3996
03:09:39,210 --> 03:09:39,790
Did we do it?

3997
03:09:40,170 --> 03:09:40,870
Stop!

3998
03:09:45,090 --> 03:09:46,230
Oh my god!

3999
03:09:46,950 --> 03:09:49,090
I'm gonna die because of the babies!

4000
03:09:56,640 --> 03:09:58,420
Oh my god!

4001
03:10:00,730 --> 03:10:01,350
Babies!

4002
03:10:01,930 --> 03:10:02,090
Two!

4003
03:10:02,570 --> 03:10:02,910
Throw!

4004
03:10:04,750 --> 03:10:05,470
Oh!

4005
03:10:05,470 --> 03:10:05,510
Oh!

4006
03:10:05,610 --> 03:10:06,510
That did actually hit her though!

4007
03:10:08,670 --> 03:10:09,830
Oh my god!

4008
03:10:10,070 --> 03:10:10,770
These stupid...

4009
03:10:10,770 --> 03:10:11,610
Stupid babies!

4010
03:10:12,310 --> 03:10:13,270
Stupid babies!

4011
03:10:23,050 --> 03:10:23,410
One...

4012
03:10:24,010 --> 03:10:24,370
Two...

4013
03:10:25,850 --> 03:10:26,570
Please!

4014
03:10:26,730 --> 03:10:26,970
Come here!

4015
03:10:27,410 --> 03:10:28,510
Come here stupid babies!

4016
03:10:28,870 --> 03:10:29,650
Stupid babies!

4017
03:10:30,190 --> 03:10:31,150
Babies hate!

4018
03:10:31,290 --> 03:10:31,730
Babies hate!

4019
03:10:33,690 --> 03:10:34,410
One...

4020
03:10:34,410 --> 03:10:34,570
Two!

4021
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:37,670
Nice!

4022
03:10:39,350 --> 03:10:40,190
One...

4023
03:10:40,190 --> 03:10:40,350
Two!

4024
03:10:42,850 --> 03:10:43,270
I...

4025
03:10:43,270 --> 03:10:43,930
I got something!

4026
03:10:45,810 --> 03:10:46,650
Babies!

4027
03:10:46,870 --> 03:10:47,470
Babies!

4028
03:10:47,950 --> 03:10:48,370
Babies!

4029
03:10:48,850 --> 03:10:49,690
Babies!

4030
03:10:49,790 --> 03:10:50,570
Babies everywhere!

4031
03:10:53,090 --> 03:10:54,370
Oh my gosh!

4032
03:10:55,250 --> 03:10:56,290
More babies!

4033
03:10:57,550 --> 03:10:58,850
R slash no big...

4034
03:10:58,850 --> 03:10:59,310
No kids!

4035
03:11:02,490 --> 03:11:03,810
Get out of here babies!

4036
03:11:05,110 --> 03:11:06,450
Get out of here babies!

4037
03:11:07,050 --> 03:11:08,510
I said they were cute and I...

4038
03:11:08,510 --> 03:11:09,070
I...

4039
03:11:09,070 --> 03:11:09,890
Don't mean it anymore!

4040
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:12,970
Oh, that's right.

4041
03:11:13,090 --> 03:11:13,990
I was almost out of this one.

4042
03:11:14,270 --> 03:11:14,870
Oh my god!

4043
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:20,140
As long as I start...

4044
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:22,100
Kill them while I'm also attacking her.

4045
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:22,960
I think it's...

4046
03:11:22,960 --> 03:11:23,800
Not so bad.

4047
03:11:25,360 --> 03:11:28,020
She just keeps non-stop having the kids!

4048
03:11:29,640 --> 03:11:30,300
Holy cow!

4049
03:11:31,280 --> 03:11:32,260
Shoot the sack!

4050
03:11:32,380 --> 03:11:32,780
I know this!

4051
03:11:32,960 --> 03:11:34,200
What do you think I'm trying to do?

4052
03:11:35,300 --> 03:11:35,640
Oh!

4053
03:11:35,820 --> 03:11:35,980
Oh!

4054
03:11:36,180 --> 03:11:36,740
We got her!

4055
03:11:36,860 --> 03:11:37,040
We got her!

4056
03:11:37,140 --> 03:11:37,980
We got her!

4057
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:41,660
Oh my god!

4058
03:11:41,780 --> 03:11:42,960
But there's so many freaking kids!

4059
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:44,180
I keep getting stuck on the kids!

4060
03:11:57,530 --> 03:11:58,070
Yippee!

4061
03:12:01,150 --> 03:12:01,690
Woohoo!

4062
03:12:02,530 --> 03:12:03,370
Oh my god!

4063
03:12:03,610 --> 03:12:04,310
I'm going... I'm leaving!

4064
03:12:05,110 --> 03:12:05,850
Say yodoro!

4065
03:12:17,700 --> 03:12:18,240
Interloper...

4066
03:12:18,770 --> 03:12:19,900
Why is it shaking so much?

4067
03:12:20,020 --> 03:12:20,120
Oh!

4068
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:24,480
Oh!

4069
03:12:29,340 --> 03:12:29,660
Ouch!

4070
03:12:29,900 --> 03:12:30,060
Ouch!

4071
03:12:30,220 --> 03:12:30,340
Ouch!

4072
03:12:30,500 --> 03:12:30,620
Please!

4073
03:12:30,760 --> 03:12:31,020
Hold on!

4074
03:12:31,620 --> 03:12:32,560
I just made it here!

4075
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:32,920
Please!

4076
03:12:37,580 --> 03:12:37,900
Ouch!

4077
03:12:39,660 --> 03:12:40,260
Oh my god!

4078
03:12:40,380 --> 03:12:41,160
There's guys everywhere!

4079
03:12:41,920 --> 03:12:42,800
Okay, this is not safe.

4080
03:12:42,980 --> 03:12:44,260
I need to...

4081
03:12:46,020 --> 03:12:46,340
Um...

4082
03:12:46,340 --> 03:12:47,780
I have one HP and a dream.

4083
03:12:48,040 --> 03:12:49,220
Probably gonna have to restart this.

4084
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:52,540
Um...

4085
03:12:52,540 --> 03:12:52,940
Oh!

4086
03:12:54,300 --> 03:12:54,860
Well...

4087
03:12:54,860 --> 03:12:55,400
That's...

4088
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:55,640
Oh!

4089
03:12:57,640 --> 03:12:58,740
Oh, oh, okay.

4090
03:12:58,800 --> 03:12:59,600
I was like, where am I?

4091
03:12:59,720 --> 03:13:00,380
Ah, please!

4092
03:13:00,580 --> 03:13:01,440
I'm stuck on the babies!

4093
03:13:04,160 --> 03:13:04,720
Okay.

4094
03:13:05,240 --> 03:13:05,620
Alright.

4095
03:13:06,140 --> 03:13:06,660
Okay.

4096
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:07,500
Alright.

4097
03:13:10,500 --> 03:13:11,600
What is that sound?

4098
03:13:15,560 --> 03:13:16,920
It's gonna break anyway.

4099
03:13:24,250 --> 03:13:26,250
Oh, why am I going up the same way as before?

4100
03:13:28,550 --> 03:13:28,950
Okay.

4101
03:13:29,630 --> 03:13:30,030
Alright.

4102
03:13:37,620 --> 03:13:38,020
Okay.

4103
03:13:38,540 --> 03:13:39,900
Maybe if I save here, it's okay.

4104
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:42,700
Um...

4105
03:13:43,300 --> 03:13:43,980
Oh my god.

4106
03:13:44,120 --> 03:13:44,800
Oh my god.

4107
03:13:47,140 --> 03:13:48,040
Oh my god.

4108
03:13:48,380 --> 03:13:48,860
I don't...

4109
03:13:48,860 --> 03:13:49,320
Now what?

4110
03:13:49,420 --> 03:13:50,200
Yeah, now what?

4111
03:13:50,200 --> 03:13:51,180
That is a great question.

4112
03:13:52,280 --> 03:13:52,760
Um...

4113
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:54,300
Things keep dropping from the sky.

4114
03:13:55,300 --> 03:13:55,780
And...

4115
03:13:55,780 --> 03:13:56,380
Uh...

4116
03:13:56,380 --> 03:13:57,080
Oh, there's a cave.

4117
03:13:57,340 --> 03:13:58,180
Maybe with health?

4118
03:14:01,160 --> 03:14:02,320
Oh, healing water!

4119
03:14:02,580 --> 03:14:03,160
Oh my god.

4120
03:14:03,240 --> 03:14:03,600
We got the...

4121
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:04,780
We made it to the healing water!

4122
03:14:05,020 --> 03:14:06,060
Oh my gosh.

4123
03:14:06,320 --> 03:14:06,640
Ah!

4124
03:14:08,900 --> 03:14:09,300
Ah!

4125
03:14:10,660 --> 03:14:12,340
Worst enemy in the game incoming...

4126
03:14:12,340 --> 03:14:12,560
What is it?

4127
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:13,360
The alien babies?

4128
03:14:13,460 --> 03:14:14,200
Because I hate those guys.

4129
03:14:17,980 --> 03:14:18,380
Alright.

4130
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:19,240
We'll save in here.

4131
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:20,900
100%.

4132
03:14:20,900 --> 03:14:21,560
Oh my god.

4133
03:14:30,510 --> 03:14:30,910
Okay.

4134
03:14:33,350 --> 03:14:35,190
This took me so long to figure out.

4135
03:14:35,190 --> 03:14:37,190
Let me try for a bit.

4136
03:14:37,530 --> 03:14:38,370
And then I'll...

4137
03:14:38,370 --> 03:14:38,770
Um...

4138
03:14:38,770 --> 03:14:40,390
See if I want any hints or anything.

4139
03:14:42,150 --> 03:14:43,390
Oh, uh...

4140
03:14:44,100 --> 03:14:44,410
Okay.

4141
03:14:44,970 --> 03:14:46,010
I'm in here.

4142
03:14:48,110 --> 03:14:49,110
Where am I?

4143
03:14:50,550 --> 03:14:51,770
This doesn't hurt.

4144
03:14:51,790 --> 03:14:52,310
I remember.

4145
03:14:53,110 --> 03:14:54,430
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4146
03:14:55,030 --> 03:14:55,650
Okay.

4147
03:14:56,750 --> 03:14:57,770
No elk.

4148
03:14:58,030 --> 03:14:58,450
For now!

4149
03:15:00,230 --> 03:15:00,850
Okay.

4150
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:07,180
Oh.

4151
03:15:07,440 --> 03:15:08,080
Stinking.

4152
03:15:12,610 --> 03:15:18,050
I never want to see another headcrap ever again in my afterlife after this game.

4153
03:15:18,470 --> 03:15:20,450
Which is funny because if I...

4154
03:15:20,970 --> 03:15:21,610
Oh.

4155
03:15:22,170 --> 03:15:22,710
Oh.

4156
03:15:23,170 --> 03:15:23,610
Oh.

4157
03:15:24,290 --> 03:15:24,750
Oh.

4158
03:15:25,030 --> 03:15:25,410
Uh.

4159
03:15:25,630 --> 03:15:26,010
Uh-oh.

4160
03:15:26,350 --> 03:15:26,630
Uh-oh.

4161
03:15:30,370 --> 03:15:30,550
Okay.

4162
03:15:33,490 --> 03:15:34,130
That happened?

4163
03:15:38,390 --> 03:15:39,030
Wait.

4164
03:15:39,150 --> 03:15:40,190
Until Half-Life 2.

4165
03:15:40,330 --> 03:15:40,830
Oh, I know.

4166
03:15:41,730 --> 03:15:42,330
Why not?

4167
03:15:43,150 --> 03:15:44,470
Oh, I thought that was a headcrap.

4168
03:15:44,930 --> 03:15:45,590
That's funny.

4169
03:15:46,830 --> 03:15:47,070
Okay.

4170
03:15:50,330 --> 03:15:51,950
How do I have no more?

4171
03:15:52,070 --> 03:15:52,530
Oh my gosh.

4172
03:15:52,550 --> 03:15:53,070
That's crazy.

4173
03:15:57,810 --> 03:15:59,810
I wish I could hold on to more ammo.

4174
03:16:05,530 --> 03:16:07,690
I hear someone behind me, but I don't know where.

4175
03:16:09,750 --> 03:16:10,650
What the hell?

4176
03:16:10,830 --> 03:16:11,090
Oh.

4177
03:16:11,290 --> 03:16:11,990
It's this guy.

4178
03:16:20,270 --> 03:16:21,190
Oh my god.

4179
03:16:24,110 --> 03:16:24,630
Okay.

4180
03:16:25,110 --> 03:16:25,210
Uh.

4181
03:16:25,450 --> 03:16:26,350
B-b-b-bees.

4182
03:16:26,530 --> 03:16:27,310
Maybe is best.

4183
03:16:30,290 --> 03:16:31,890
Just wanna figure out where to go.

4184
03:16:34,010 --> 03:16:35,190
I'm going to save.

4185
03:16:36,590 --> 03:16:39,230
Maybe against my better judgment, but you know.

4186
03:16:39,550 --> 03:16:40,350
It's fine.

4187
03:16:41,250 --> 03:16:41,710
What is this?

4188
03:16:41,790 --> 03:16:42,550
Health pack!

4189
03:16:42,910 --> 03:16:43,270
Oh!

4190
03:16:44,070 --> 03:16:44,510
Okay.

4191
03:16:44,870 --> 03:16:45,070
Cool.

4192
03:16:46,690 --> 03:16:48,190
Thank you, alien planet.

4193
03:16:48,870 --> 03:16:50,090
How kind of you.

4194
03:16:50,870 --> 03:16:52,250
To kid or to me.

4195
03:16:53,270 --> 03:16:54,170
And my needs.

4196
03:16:55,970 --> 03:16:56,990
What's under here?

4197
03:16:57,250 --> 03:16:57,510
Nothing.

4198
03:16:57,710 --> 03:16:57,830
Okay.

4199
03:17:01,870 --> 03:17:03,090
I guess we go this way.

4200
03:17:07,490 --> 03:17:08,550
Rocket and health.

4201
03:17:08,930 --> 03:17:09,090
Cool.

4202
03:17:17,220 --> 03:17:18,860
I don't know why I thought that would work.

4203
03:17:26,870 --> 03:17:28,210
Med kits for guests.

4204
03:17:28,630 --> 03:17:29,170
Yeah, exactly.

4205
03:17:30,850 --> 03:17:31,410
Oh!

4206
03:17:35,700 --> 03:17:36,260
Um.

4207
03:17:41,370 --> 03:17:41,930
Oh!

4208
03:17:43,790 --> 03:17:44,770
Uh.

4209
03:17:46,690 --> 03:17:47,670
Oops.

4210
03:17:55,440 --> 03:17:57,680
It's the longest pillar ever.

4211
03:17:57,860 --> 03:17:59,020
It's such a big burrito.

4212
03:18:15,710 --> 03:18:17,050
Oh my god.

4213
03:18:17,290 --> 03:18:18,230
Oh my god.

4214
03:18:19,130 --> 03:18:19,650
Woo!

4215
03:18:20,970 --> 03:18:21,950
Uh.

4216
03:18:22,990 --> 03:18:23,190
Uh.

4217
03:18:23,670 --> 03:18:24,610
Wait.

4218
03:18:26,030 --> 03:18:27,710
Oh my gosh, please.

4219
03:18:28,850 --> 03:18:29,490
Okay.

4220
03:18:30,070 --> 03:18:30,570
Aaaah.

4221
03:18:35,310 --> 03:18:36,270
Aaaaah.

4222
03:18:36,430 --> 03:18:36,670
God.

4223
03:18:37,010 --> 03:18:37,710
Oh my god.

4224
03:18:41,430 --> 03:18:41,910
Oh!

4225
03:18:42,410 --> 03:18:44,070
Combat platforming.

4226
03:18:44,530 --> 03:18:45,210
Oh.

4227
03:18:55,170 --> 03:18:56,130
Sorry.

4228
03:18:56,290 --> 03:18:57,030
I was blocking it.

4229
03:18:59,050 --> 03:18:59,530
Okay.

4230
03:18:59,530 --> 03:18:59,570
Okay.

4231
03:19:04,050 --> 03:19:05,490
Zen is... yeah.

4232
03:19:06,410 --> 03:19:08,030
Kill them before going up.

4233
03:19:08,910 --> 03:19:10,190
I could just try.

4234
03:19:11,090 --> 03:19:11,150
Oh.

4235
03:19:13,430 --> 03:19:15,390
I somehow just did that.

4236
03:19:15,630 --> 03:19:15,750
Okay.

4237
03:19:16,490 --> 03:19:16,810
Okay.

4238
03:19:19,950 --> 03:19:21,330
Don't hurt me, please.

4239
03:19:24,250 --> 03:19:26,470
He's like eating them up when I kill them.

4240
03:19:30,770 --> 03:19:31,590
Or... something.

4241
03:19:32,090 --> 03:19:32,590
Maybe not.

4242
03:19:35,950 --> 03:19:37,030
I thought he was.

4243
03:19:38,510 --> 03:19:39,510
Okay, never mind.

4244
03:19:42,090 --> 03:19:44,250
The devs apologize for Zen.

4245
03:19:46,610 --> 03:19:48,450
This is... this is pretty rough.

4246
03:19:48,670 --> 03:19:49,230
I'm not gonna lie.

4247
03:19:50,730 --> 03:19:52,570
Okay, we got one alien.

4248
03:19:53,590 --> 03:19:55,090
I wish I could go heal again.

4249
03:19:55,270 --> 03:19:55,910
In fact, we can.

4250
03:19:56,210 --> 03:19:56,590
Actually.

4251
03:19:57,130 --> 03:19:57,690
Oh my gosh.

4252
03:20:00,850 --> 03:20:02,490
All I have to do is go in here and we can heal.

4253
03:20:05,630 --> 03:20:06,970
And... oh my gosh, I missed the ammo.

4254
03:20:10,070 --> 03:20:10,590
Oh.

4255
03:20:11,330 --> 03:20:11,650
Oh.

4256
03:20:12,010 --> 03:20:12,370
Uh, hello?

4257
03:20:12,530 --> 03:20:12,850
There we go.

4258
03:20:16,970 --> 03:20:18,990
Back to the Minto cave.

4259
03:20:20,970 --> 03:20:21,490
Oh.

4260
03:20:22,210 --> 03:20:23,110
We'll heal.

4261
03:20:23,590 --> 03:20:24,350
We'll take out.

4262
03:20:24,510 --> 03:20:24,950
Oh my gosh.

4263
03:20:25,110 --> 03:20:26,570
We're Nancy Drew in the onsen.

4264
03:20:27,130 --> 03:20:28,450
And at the Rio Con.

4265
03:20:33,270 --> 03:20:34,610
Zen has some nice onsen.

4266
03:20:34,610 --> 03:20:35,850
It's what I just said.

4267
03:20:38,050 --> 03:20:39,830
Exactly what I just said.

4268
03:20:40,710 --> 03:20:40,910
Alright.

4269
03:20:41,890 --> 03:20:43,190
I assume there's a guy in here.

4270
03:20:43,590 --> 03:20:44,550
Oh, he's right there.

4271
03:20:47,330 --> 03:20:47,890
Jerk.

4272
03:20:49,370 --> 03:20:50,690
This is my bath time.

4273
03:20:52,730 --> 03:20:53,950
Alright, so I...

4274
03:20:53,950 --> 03:20:56,170
I'm not gonna go back in there.

4275
03:21:00,290 --> 03:21:00,690
Where?

4276
03:21:00,790 --> 03:21:02,010
Did I get all the aliens?

4277
03:21:04,990 --> 03:21:06,910
Maybe I did, but I'm just not sure.

4278
03:21:07,370 --> 03:21:07,930
Do I...

4279
03:21:08,370 --> 03:21:10,370
When they beam, do I touch it?

4280
03:21:10,530 --> 03:21:12,190
I feel like I shouldn't, but...

4281
03:21:12,190 --> 03:21:14,010
I don't know anymore in this game.

4282
03:21:14,590 --> 03:21:14,810
Oh!

4283
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:21,360
Oh!

4284
03:21:22,500 --> 03:21:23,880
I don't know where that leads.

4285
03:21:23,880 --> 03:21:25,100
I don't know.

4286
03:21:26,980 --> 03:21:27,500
Um...

4287
03:21:27,500 --> 03:21:27,580
Oh!

4288
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:28,640
I...

4289
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:29,600
Stupid.

4290
03:21:30,220 --> 03:21:30,860
Think they keep...

4291
03:21:30,860 --> 03:21:31,820
No, I meant the...

4292
03:21:31,820 --> 03:21:33,740
I don't think the big aliens do, right?

4293
03:21:34,380 --> 03:21:35,740
The small ones...

4294
03:21:35,740 --> 03:21:36,100
Oh, shoot.

4295
03:21:37,620 --> 03:21:38,680
Forgot about that guy.

4296
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:41,720
I don't see any...

4297
03:21:41,720 --> 03:21:42,900
Any alien babies.

4298
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:46,740
Anymore, at least.

4299
03:22:00,340 --> 03:22:00,820
Oh...

4300
03:22:00,820 --> 03:22:01,320
Oh...

4301
03:22:05,190 --> 03:22:06,010
I'm gonna die.

4302
03:22:08,780 --> 03:22:09,680
That was fun.

4303
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:10,540
That was good.

4304
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:11,180
That was harsh.

4305
03:22:18,440 --> 03:22:18,920
Okay.

4306
03:22:19,140 --> 03:22:19,740
Let me try again.

4307
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:20,320
Oh, no.

4308
03:22:21,420 --> 03:22:21,740
Zap!

4309
03:22:21,900 --> 03:22:22,520
Beam me up!

4310
03:22:22,860 --> 03:22:23,600
Beam me up!

4311
03:22:24,380 --> 03:22:26,080
Alien overlords, I welcome thee!

4312
03:22:28,300 --> 03:22:29,080
Oh, shoot.

4313
03:22:29,360 --> 03:22:29,860
Oh, no.

4314
03:22:30,280 --> 03:22:30,740
Oh, no.

4315
03:22:30,900 --> 03:22:31,400
Oh, no.

4316
03:22:31,820 --> 03:22:31,900
Oh, no.

4317
03:22:32,420 --> 03:22:34,480
Felix, thank you for the...

4318
03:22:35,280 --> 03:22:35,600
Ah!

4319
03:22:42,340 --> 03:22:43,680
Thank you for the pink.

4320
03:22:46,450 --> 03:22:47,610
Oh, my God.

4321
03:22:50,330 --> 03:22:51,350
I gamed.

4322
03:22:51,650 --> 03:22:52,430
I gamed!

4323
03:22:55,330 --> 03:22:56,270
I'm stuck.

4324
03:22:56,590 --> 03:22:58,350
I don't know what to do.

4325
03:22:59,630 --> 03:23:00,990
I don't know...

4326
03:23:00,990 --> 03:23:02,650
I don't know what to do.

4327
03:23:10,580 --> 03:23:11,460
Elp time?

4328
03:23:11,740 --> 03:23:12,700
Yeah, I think so.

4329
03:23:13,380 --> 03:23:14,340
Maybe elp time.

4330
03:23:15,400 --> 03:23:17,180
Do I get up on the hydra's back?

4331
03:23:18,300 --> 03:23:18,860
Or...

4332
03:23:20,360 --> 03:23:20,920
Save?

4333
03:23:21,940 --> 03:23:22,480
Okay.

4334
03:23:22,760 --> 03:23:23,200
I saved.

4335
03:23:24,020 --> 03:23:25,100
Look to the left.

4336
03:23:25,800 --> 03:23:26,580
Is it that?

4337
03:23:26,920 --> 03:23:28,220
That's where I came from, though?

4338
03:23:30,980 --> 03:23:31,980
Go to the portal.

4339
03:23:33,300 --> 03:23:34,640
You need to enter that portal.

4340
03:23:35,460 --> 03:23:35,960
Oh, really?

4341
03:23:37,180 --> 03:23:38,300
Isn't that where I came from?

4342
03:23:44,090 --> 03:23:45,870
I don't know why I didn't think I'd get this far.

4343
03:23:49,550 --> 03:23:50,570
To the portal.

4344
03:23:51,950 --> 03:23:53,970
Do I have to ride on those guys' back?

4345
03:23:54,170 --> 03:23:55,570
Oh, he just died.

4346
03:23:57,930 --> 03:23:58,910
Catch a ride.

4347
03:23:59,730 --> 03:24:01,490
A little stingray.

4348
03:24:03,830 --> 03:24:06,650
This is like the worst one to be on.

4349
03:24:06,890 --> 03:24:11,970
I can't... Like,

4350
03:24:16,290 --> 03:24:21,350
I can't make it to... Ouch.

4351
03:24:22,550 --> 03:24:22,990
Okay.

4352
03:24:24,170 --> 03:24:24,690
Alright.

4353
03:24:26,750 --> 03:24:28,770
Unfortunately, I had to take damage for that.

4354
03:24:30,930 --> 03:24:32,050
Oh, gosh.

4355
03:24:35,550 --> 03:24:37,570
And sometimes, they dive.

4356
03:24:37,830 --> 03:24:38,030
Okay.

4357
03:24:38,110 --> 03:24:38,590
Good to know.

4358
03:24:39,550 --> 03:24:42,630
Sometimes, they just... They... Okay.

4359
03:24:42,730 --> 03:24:46,490
So, we need to go to the guys on the... Oh, my God.

4360
03:24:46,730 --> 03:24:46,950
Oh!

4361
03:24:49,170 --> 03:24:49,610
Hello.

4362
03:24:51,770 --> 03:24:52,210
Goodbye.

4363
03:24:55,830 --> 03:24:56,270
Alright.

4364
03:24:56,410 --> 03:24:57,210
Catch a ride.

4365
03:24:59,090 --> 03:25:00,430
Catch a ride.

4366
03:25:00,590 --> 03:25:01,290
Catch a ride.

4367
03:25:01,510 --> 03:25:02,030
Catch a ride.

4368
03:25:02,170 --> 03:25:02,350
Oh.

4369
03:25:02,350 --> 03:25:03,410
Huh?

4370
03:25:12,640 --> 03:25:13,300
Huh?

4371
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:34,700
Wrong way.

4372
03:25:35,060 --> 03:25:35,860
Let's figure it out.

4373
03:25:36,040 --> 03:25:36,400
We'll see.

4374
03:25:42,340 --> 03:25:48,040
I thought that's why... I thought I didn't come to... I didn't think about going to this portal, because I thought this is where I came from.

4375
03:25:53,610 --> 03:25:54,070
Woohoo!

4376
03:26:08,090 --> 03:26:10,750
Anything else to help me out around here?

4377
03:26:11,170 --> 03:26:12,050
Who is speaking?

4378
03:26:15,550 --> 03:26:16,390
My friend.

4379
03:26:31,830 --> 03:26:33,210
Oh, I think I keep missing.

4380
03:26:34,510 --> 03:26:35,570
Or, maybe not.

4381
03:26:36,370 --> 03:26:37,350
Maybe he got bored.

4382
03:26:38,150 --> 03:26:39,030
The bee gun.

4383
03:26:39,310 --> 03:26:39,770
Oh, gosh.

4384
03:26:40,110 --> 03:26:40,830
Okay, bee gun.

4385
03:26:47,930 --> 03:26:49,630
Oh, these are the tentacles!

4386
03:26:50,430 --> 03:26:51,910
Oh, it's this guy!

4387
03:26:54,110 --> 03:26:55,890
The one that doesn't like sound!

4388
03:26:56,250 --> 03:26:57,010
Oh, no.

4389
03:26:58,390 --> 03:26:59,310
I see.

4390
03:27:02,710 --> 03:27:03,630
What was that?

4391
03:27:10,630 --> 03:27:13,190
Okay, I'll be sneaking this whole area then.

4392
03:27:17,520 --> 03:27:18,440
What is that?

4393
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:20,260
Oh, my gosh.

4394
03:27:20,400 --> 03:27:21,600
And the trees can get me.

4395
03:27:21,800 --> 03:27:22,360
This sucks.

4396
03:27:22,560 --> 03:27:24,020
Wait, is that the... is that bee man?

4397
03:27:32,670 --> 03:27:33,190
Uh-oh.

4398
03:27:33,830 --> 03:27:34,330
Uh-oh.

4399
03:27:34,770 --> 03:27:35,650
I think they know I'm here.

4400
03:27:38,830 --> 03:27:40,030
I think they know I'm here.

4401
03:27:49,170 --> 03:27:49,730
Shit.

4402
03:27:50,890 --> 03:27:51,630
Oh, my God.

4403
03:28:05,270 --> 03:28:07,350
That's definitely not the suit that's talking.

4404
03:28:07,670 --> 03:28:08,290
Something's talking.

4405
03:28:08,490 --> 03:28:08,950
Something's speaking.

4406
03:28:16,780 --> 03:28:23,960
Okay, so if I move, if I run, the tentacles come out it seems.

4407
03:28:25,680 --> 03:28:29,120
But I wanna jump some... I don't know.

4408
03:28:29,440 --> 03:28:30,580
I actually don't know.

4409
03:28:30,780 --> 03:28:31,280
Okay, let's see.

4410
03:28:35,430 --> 03:28:36,710
You don't hear anything?

4411
03:28:38,630 --> 03:28:40,770
It's like a very like...

4412
03:28:46,270 --> 03:28:47,150
Like that.

4413
03:28:50,070 --> 03:28:50,630
Oh!

4414
03:28:50,810 --> 03:28:52,210
Oh my god, I'm getting hit by the tree.

4415
03:28:53,770 --> 03:28:55,070
Sticking trees, man.

4416
03:28:58,390 --> 03:28:58,950
Okay.

4417
03:28:59,490 --> 03:29:01,410
There's a floating rock over here.

4418
03:29:01,690 --> 03:29:05,890
But if I... get this guy, then they know I'm here.

4419
03:29:06,270 --> 03:29:08,250
And then they're like, wee-woo, wee-woo!

4420
03:29:08,550 --> 03:29:10,290
So let's just try going in.

4421
03:29:12,390 --> 03:29:14,170
Who the heck is that guy over there?

4422
03:29:14,530 --> 03:29:17,250
He was throwing his hands around like he's yapping.

4423
03:29:23,980 --> 03:29:26,040
Oh, I think that's one of the zappy guys.

4424
03:29:26,200 --> 03:29:27,300
Yeah, that's one of the zappy guys.

4425
03:29:29,160 --> 03:29:29,640
Okay.

4426
03:29:47,320 --> 03:29:48,580
He's hard at work.

4427
03:29:48,740 --> 03:29:50,120
And he's being looked over.

4428
03:29:53,200 --> 03:29:55,200
I'm trying to figure out...

4429
03:30:09,430 --> 03:30:10,410
I have no idea.

4430
03:30:17,030 --> 03:30:19,970
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna sneak in and see what happens.

4431
03:30:21,150 --> 03:30:21,230
Oh.

4432
03:30:22,070 --> 03:30:22,630
Oh.

4433
03:30:24,230 --> 03:30:24,790
Run!

4434
03:30:31,760 --> 03:30:33,160
What the hell is this room?

4435
03:30:33,380 --> 03:30:33,640
Oh.

4436
03:30:33,940 --> 03:30:35,580
Wait, this sounds like... a healing room.

4437
03:30:36,460 --> 03:30:36,980
Please.

4438
03:30:38,700 --> 03:30:39,960
I hear water!

4439
03:30:41,680 --> 03:30:42,540
No way.

4440
03:30:43,860 --> 03:30:45,420
Oh, that's so rude.

4441
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:47,560
That's so rude.

4442
03:30:50,240 --> 03:30:52,280
Don't even be like that.

4443
03:30:54,360 --> 03:30:55,740
New onsen.

4444
03:30:56,760 --> 03:30:58,780
Yeah, but now it's contaminated with...

4445
03:30:58,780 --> 03:31:00,940
with bits of monster.

4446
03:31:01,860 --> 03:31:03,020
Bit of alien.

4447
03:31:03,400 --> 03:31:03,820
Gross.

4448
03:31:05,420 --> 03:31:06,220
Gross.

4449
03:31:06,220 --> 03:31:06,520
Gross.

4450
03:31:24,110 --> 03:31:26,030
Maybe we can get some more stuff inside.

4451
03:31:27,810 --> 03:31:28,510
Go, go, go.

4452
03:31:28,730 --> 03:31:28,890
Okay.

4453
03:31:30,670 --> 03:31:31,150
Never mind.

4454
03:31:31,350 --> 03:31:34,710
Oh, this is where the nastiness was being pushed out.

4455
03:31:37,890 --> 03:31:38,650
No, no, no.

4456
03:31:38,910 --> 03:31:40,110
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4457
03:31:40,110 --> 03:31:42,610
No, no, no, no, no.

4458
03:31:43,510 --> 03:31:44,070
No, no, no, no, no.

4459
03:31:51,860 --> 03:31:53,140
It's because I was walking.

4460
03:32:04,410 --> 03:32:04,890
Oh,

4461
03:32:08,890 --> 03:32:09,690
see, now they're alert.

4462
03:32:09,830 --> 03:32:11,690
The guards are alerted.

4463
03:32:12,210 --> 03:32:13,250
So, let's see.

4464
03:32:13,590 --> 03:32:15,710
I should have just taken them out anyway, then.

4465
03:32:21,050 --> 03:32:25,430
I should have just taken them out from behind when I had the chance.

4466
03:32:25,430 --> 03:32:27,590
Wait, but there is something over here, too.

4467
03:32:31,090 --> 03:32:32,170
He doesn't see me?

4468
03:32:33,390 --> 03:32:34,570
I'm too small.

4469
03:32:35,510 --> 03:32:37,610
I'm just an itty-bitty human!

4470
03:32:51,810 --> 03:32:56,030
Oh my god!

4471
03:33:01,580 --> 03:33:02,820
Holy cow!

4472
03:33:07,600 --> 03:33:10,120
I don't think the bees do anything against him.

4473
03:33:22,300 --> 03:33:25,740
I'm wondering if I should save or not, you know?

4474
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:31,500
Only explosives or gluon works.

4475
03:33:31,720 --> 03:33:32,240
Oh, what?

4476
03:33:32,700 --> 03:33:33,260
Okay.

4477
03:33:34,020 --> 03:33:36,140
But what if we sneak past him?

4478
03:33:36,520 --> 03:33:38,060
Yeah, let's make a new save.

4479
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:41,620
Instead of a quick save.

4480
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:42,120
Okay.

4481
03:33:49,620 --> 03:33:52,300
I'm sneaking, I'm sneaking, I'm sneaking.

4482
03:33:53,140 --> 03:33:56,660
Cause I don't know if you guys remember, but I don't have like any ammo.

4483
03:33:57,520 --> 03:33:58,360
Oh, just kidding.

4484
03:33:58,360 --> 03:33:58,920
I have 65.

4485
03:33:59,300 --> 03:33:59,940
When did I get that?

4486
03:34:01,620 --> 03:34:03,040
I don't want to waste it all.

4487
03:34:05,680 --> 03:34:06,880
I see a hole.

4488
03:34:11,450 --> 03:34:12,590
Oh my god.

4489
03:34:17,770 --> 03:34:19,130
Cause there's no one in here, right?

4490
03:34:27,970 --> 03:34:29,010
Oh gosh.

4491
03:34:29,550 --> 03:34:30,830
I didn't see any other holes.

4492
03:34:33,950 --> 03:34:35,610
I didn't see any other holes.

4493
03:34:37,790 --> 03:34:38,230
Safe.

4494
03:34:38,670 --> 03:34:38,970
Okay.

4495
03:34:45,540 --> 03:34:46,960
Oh my god, look at him.

4496
03:34:47,520 --> 03:34:48,320
He's kinda cool.

4497
03:34:48,980 --> 03:34:50,200
Oh, did he notice me?

4498
03:34:50,620 --> 03:34:52,340
Wait, he's also got an arm.

4499
03:34:53,480 --> 03:34:54,520
On his chest.

4500
03:34:55,000 --> 03:34:56,220
He's just a- Oh my god.

4501
03:34:56,360 --> 03:34:56,760
Oh my god.

4502
03:34:56,940 --> 03:34:57,520
Oh my god.

4503
03:34:57,740 --> 03:34:58,200
Oh my god.

4504
03:34:58,200 --> 03:34:58,200
Okay.

4505
03:35:04,460 --> 03:35:05,620
He's spawn camping.

4506
03:35:09,810 --> 03:35:12,350
Do I need to go up on- Is this an elevator?

4507
03:35:12,610 --> 03:35:12,990
Let me see.

4508
03:35:16,510 --> 03:35:17,170
Maybe not.

4509
03:35:29,280 --> 03:35:34,720
I don't- Is there- A way to even sneak past this guy.

4510
03:35:35,900 --> 03:35:37,640
He gets aggroed so easily.

4511
03:35:39,120 --> 03:35:40,960
Is it this right here that I go to?

4512
03:35:41,200 --> 03:35:42,280
I thought that's where I came from.

4513
03:35:42,280 --> 03:35:43,580
Oh- Or is this where I came from?

4514
03:35:44,400 --> 03:35:45,500
No, I came from over there.

4515
03:35:45,660 --> 03:35:46,660
Okay, so I go straight ahead.

4516
03:35:46,880 --> 03:35:47,000
Okay.

4517
03:35:57,250 --> 03:35:57,570
Oops.

4518
03:36:04,350 --> 03:36:05,630
Wait, why do I hear planes?

4519
03:36:09,150 --> 03:36:10,490
Yeah, I didn't know that was a pit.

4520
03:36:12,210 --> 03:36:13,570
Yeah, I didn't know that was a pit.

4521
03:36:17,070 --> 03:36:17,930
Yeah, that's okay.

4522
03:36:27,270 --> 03:36:27,670
Shoot.

4523
03:36:33,170 --> 03:36:33,570
Okay.

4524
03:36:35,450 --> 03:36:36,670
We got this though.

4525
03:36:38,770 --> 03:36:39,750
We got this.

4526
03:36:40,870 --> 03:36:42,310
Why does it take so long to load?

4527
03:36:42,510 --> 03:36:44,050
Oh, that's- I was like, hello?

4528
03:36:44,250 --> 03:36:46,130
I didn't realize that it wasn't a loading screen.

4529
03:36:46,330 --> 03:36:48,810
I thought it was- It was my dead body lying there.

4530
03:36:49,030 --> 03:36:50,290
I thought it was a loading screen.

4531
03:36:50,290 --> 03:36:50,610
Okay.

4532
03:36:51,490 --> 03:36:52,770
We've got this!

4533
03:36:54,870 --> 03:36:56,590
He looks like a big...

4534
03:36:57,850 --> 03:36:59,410
Like a big roly-poly.

4535
03:37:00,010 --> 03:37:01,050
He's kind of cute.

4536
03:37:03,170 --> 03:37:05,110
The way he runs away is so funny.

4537
03:37:07,030 --> 03:37:07,630
Okay.

4538
03:37:08,150 --> 03:37:09,170
Oh, please.

4539
03:37:09,390 --> 03:37:09,670
Please.

4540
03:37:09,990 --> 03:37:10,390
Please.

4541
03:37:10,690 --> 03:37:10,850
Please.

4542
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:16,340
Why can't I jump?

4543
03:37:16,540 --> 03:37:17,300
Why can't I move?

4544
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:18,240
Okay.

4545
03:37:18,660 --> 03:37:19,100
Right there.

4546
03:37:19,100 --> 03:37:20,560
And there.

4547
03:37:20,720 --> 03:37:21,420
And there.

4548
03:37:22,160 --> 03:37:22,860
And...

4549
03:37:31,480 --> 03:37:32,180
Wait.

4550
03:37:34,920 --> 03:37:37,120
I don't know if this is...

4551
03:37:37,120 --> 03:37:37,880
Uh...

4552
03:37:39,020 --> 03:37:39,760
What...

4553
03:37:39,760 --> 03:37:40,500
Uh...

4554
03:37:40,500 --> 03:37:41,540
Well, I guess it...

4555
03:37:41,540 --> 03:37:43,500
Could be worse.

4556
03:37:44,760 --> 03:37:46,400
Could be worse, huh?

4557
03:37:47,040 --> 03:37:47,400
Okay.

4558
03:37:47,720 --> 03:37:49,420
Let me actually try this.

4559
03:37:51,160 --> 03:37:52,600
And these guys.

4560
03:37:52,800 --> 03:37:52,900
Yeah.

4561
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:53,860
And...

4562
03:37:53,860 --> 03:37:55,400
These guys.

4563
03:37:56,970 --> 03:37:58,340
But I'm full on health.

4564
03:38:01,060 --> 03:38:02,120
As long as I...

4565
03:38:02,120 --> 03:38:02,900
As long as I...

4566
03:38:02,900 --> 03:38:03,940
As long as I sneak, they will notice me.

4567
03:38:04,260 --> 03:38:04,720
Wait.

4568
03:38:12,440 --> 03:38:15,080
I might have used all my grenades on the...

4569
03:38:15,080 --> 03:38:16,740
On the head crab mama.

4570
03:38:16,920 --> 03:38:17,240
Oh, no.

4571
03:38:19,480 --> 03:38:20,820
If I blow him up...

4572
03:38:28,640 --> 03:38:30,000
He's just picking at something.

4573
03:38:31,140 --> 03:38:32,200
He's eating dirt.

4574
03:38:34,920 --> 03:38:35,860
Look at that.

4575
03:38:37,120 --> 03:38:37,640
Wow.

4576
03:38:37,920 --> 03:38:38,600
The game knows.

4577
03:38:40,660 --> 03:38:42,160
Game 100% knows.

4578
03:38:42,840 --> 03:38:43,040
Okay.

4579
03:38:43,120 --> 03:38:44,500
I am gonna quick save here then.

4580
03:38:55,630 --> 03:38:56,670
Is it...

4581
03:38:56,670 --> 03:38:57,910
How do I like...

4582
03:38:57,910 --> 03:38:58,850
Just kind of roll it?

4583
03:38:59,950 --> 03:39:01,830
How do I just kind of roll the grenade?

4584
03:39:02,690 --> 03:39:03,550
Don't get me.

4585
03:39:03,810 --> 03:39:04,230
Don't get me.

4586
03:39:04,490 --> 03:39:04,770
Don't...

4587
03:39:04,770 --> 03:39:05,210
Don't do it.

4588
03:39:05,510 --> 03:39:07,110
Don't do it.

4589
03:39:07,470 --> 03:39:08,070
Right click.

4590
03:39:11,870 --> 03:39:12,350
Eh?

4591
03:39:17,290 --> 03:39:17,770
Eh?

4592
03:39:18,590 --> 03:39:19,490
It's not working.

4593
03:39:27,090 --> 03:39:28,050
I think...

4594
03:39:28,050 --> 03:39:29,190
I'm just gonna ignore them.

4595
03:39:30,690 --> 03:39:31,970
Can I just go around them?

4596
03:39:34,930 --> 03:39:36,190
There's so many of them.

4597
03:39:40,570 --> 03:39:41,050
Yes?

4598
03:39:41,250 --> 03:39:41,390
Okay.

4599
03:39:42,130 --> 03:39:42,890
Let's just go around.

4600
03:39:43,150 --> 03:39:44,010
This is...

4601
03:39:45,750 --> 03:39:46,850
Are you okay, buddy?

4602
03:39:47,070 --> 03:39:47,230
Oh!

4603
03:39:52,010 --> 03:39:53,190
Where do I go to?

4604
03:39:56,030 --> 03:39:57,470
I have to go up.

4605
03:40:00,250 --> 03:40:00,910
So...

4606
03:40:00,910 --> 03:40:01,750
Nope.

4607
03:40:03,410 --> 03:40:04,070
Mmm...

4608
03:40:04,070 --> 03:40:05,430
Over the ledge?

4609
03:40:13,130 --> 03:40:15,110
Once again, mysterious planes.

4610
03:40:20,870 --> 03:40:22,190
You don't hear anything.

4611
03:40:22,490 --> 03:40:22,930
You don't...

4612
03:40:22,930 --> 03:40:23,890
You don't sense anything.

4613
03:40:30,740 --> 03:40:31,980
I made it home alive!

4614
03:40:32,400 --> 03:40:32,880
Kairos!

4615
03:40:33,500 --> 03:40:34,300
Welcome home.

4616
03:40:34,820 --> 03:40:35,300
Oh, Kairi!

4617
03:40:35,920 --> 03:40:39,540
Half-Life does have an oddly satisfying sound effects to listen to on the drive.

4618
03:40:42,800 --> 03:40:45,040
I have to make it over the ledge.

4619
03:40:45,680 --> 03:40:46,940
Like this one?

4620
03:40:47,180 --> 03:40:47,420
Oh!

4621
03:40:47,860 --> 03:40:48,400
I see, I see.

4622
03:40:48,400 --> 03:40:48,860
Okay.

4623
03:40:49,180 --> 03:40:49,920
I went the wrong way.

4624
03:40:53,180 --> 03:40:54,220
From grenades and up.

4625
03:40:54,400 --> 03:40:54,900
Yup, yup, yup.

4626
03:40:55,200 --> 03:40:55,760
I see it.

4627
03:40:55,860 --> 03:40:56,340
I see it.

4628
03:40:56,720 --> 03:40:57,420
I see it.

4629
03:40:57,500 --> 03:40:57,960
I see it.

4630
03:41:02,220 --> 03:41:03,020
Keep digging.

4631
03:41:03,640 --> 03:41:05,120
They remind me of birds.

4632
03:41:09,640 --> 03:41:12,540
They remind me of like...

4633
03:41:14,080 --> 03:41:14,500
45.

4634
03:41:14,640 --> 03:41:15,540
You didn't hear that, right?

4635
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:16,260
Okay, we're fine.

4636
03:41:16,660 --> 03:41:17,300
Maybe we're okay.

4637
03:41:17,480 --> 03:41:17,840
Oh, gosh.

4638
03:41:17,880 --> 03:41:18,760
There's a tree here.

4639
03:41:20,000 --> 03:41:21,280
There's a tree here.

4640
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:23,680
All right.

4641
03:41:24,520 --> 03:41:25,000
Onwards.

4642
03:41:26,780 --> 03:41:27,260
Onwards.

4643
03:41:27,940 --> 03:41:28,180
Onwards!

4644
03:41:28,300 --> 03:41:28,780
Okay!

4645
03:41:32,180 --> 03:41:33,100
Not bad!

4646
03:41:34,560 --> 03:41:35,040
Maybe?

4647
03:41:39,550 --> 03:41:40,030
What?

4648
03:41:40,190 --> 03:41:40,350
Oh!

4649
03:41:40,470 --> 03:41:40,830
Oh!

4650
03:41:40,970 --> 03:41:41,170
Oh my gosh!

4651
03:41:41,350 --> 03:41:41,770
Sorry, guys.

4652
03:41:41,970 --> 03:41:42,950
I just...

4653
03:41:43,790 --> 03:41:45,530
I just got out of the game somehow.

4654
03:41:46,050 --> 03:41:46,290
Okay.

4655
03:41:49,210 --> 03:41:49,690
Okay.

4656
03:41:51,270 --> 03:41:54,310
Guys, I'm gonna go grab a drink real quick.

4657
03:41:54,310 --> 03:41:55,450
I'm out of tea.

4658
03:41:56,230 --> 03:41:57,410
So, I'm gonna go get that.

4659
03:41:58,990 --> 03:41:59,390
And...

4660
03:41:59,390 --> 03:41:59,590
Hold on.

4661
03:41:59,670 --> 03:41:59,910
Let's see.

4662
03:41:59,990 --> 03:42:00,590
Where are we?

4663
03:42:00,890 --> 03:42:01,610
Where are we?

4664
03:42:01,710 --> 03:42:02,170
Where are we?

4665
03:42:02,870 --> 03:42:03,270
Um...

4666
03:42:04,230 --> 03:42:04,630
Half...

4667
03:42:06,630 --> 03:42:07,430
We're on...

4668
03:42:08,450 --> 03:42:08,850
Uh...

4669
03:42:08,850 --> 03:42:09,270
Oh!

4670
03:42:09,650 --> 03:42:11,350
Wait, I think I just have this chapter?

4671
03:42:11,350 --> 03:42:12,650
And then the boss?

4672
03:42:12,750 --> 03:42:13,670
And then that's it, right?

4673
03:42:13,990 --> 03:42:14,930
Oh my gosh!

4674
03:42:16,470 --> 03:42:16,870
Woohoo!

4675
03:42:17,650 --> 03:42:18,050
Oh!

4676
03:42:18,370 --> 03:42:19,530
Yeah, I gotta stay hydrated.

4677
03:42:19,750 --> 03:42:20,150
Cause my...

4678
03:42:20,150 --> 03:42:21,050
My voice...

4679
03:42:21,050 --> 03:42:22,350
My throat has not been so good.

4680
03:42:22,350 --> 03:42:25,930
So I wanna make sure that I'm drinking lots of water and tea and stuff.

4681
03:42:26,150 --> 03:42:26,390
So...

4682
03:42:26,390 --> 03:42:26,630
Yeah!

4683
03:42:26,850 --> 03:42:27,530
I'll be right back!

4684
03:42:28,450 --> 03:42:28,890
Um...

4685
03:42:28,890 --> 03:42:29,950
Actually, do I have any?

4686
03:42:30,850 --> 03:42:31,430
Let's see.

4687
03:42:31,670 --> 03:42:33,470
I have no throat tea left, I think.

4688
03:42:33,570 --> 03:42:34,710
But I do have...

4689
03:42:36,130 --> 03:42:37,810
I do have some...

4690
03:42:38,250 --> 03:42:40,390
Some other stuff that I can use.

4691
03:42:42,650 --> 03:42:43,550
Okie dokie!

4692
03:42:45,430 --> 03:42:47,370
I think even next week...

4693
03:42:47,370 --> 03:42:49,930
I might take some more days off, you guys.

4694
03:42:50,210 --> 03:42:51,910
Cause I have so much I need to work on.

4695
03:42:52,090 --> 03:42:53,090
And it's all singing.

4696
03:42:54,710 --> 03:42:57,330
And I can't sing if my voice is not good.

4697
03:42:59,130 --> 03:42:59,670
So...

4698
03:43:00,370 --> 03:43:00,640
Nah...

4699
03:43:01,750 --> 03:43:02,290
Nah...

4700
03:43:03,110 --> 03:43:04,750
I feel so bad about it.

4701
03:43:05,130 --> 03:43:05,690
What the heck?

4702
03:43:07,990 --> 03:43:09,450
I feel so bad about it.

4703
03:43:12,070 --> 03:43:16,230
Since in May I'll be taking a lot of days off, but...

4704
03:43:18,070 --> 03:43:19,290
But after May...

4705
03:43:19,290 --> 03:43:20,510
After May it'll be all good.

4706
03:43:21,330 --> 03:43:21,630
After...

4707
03:43:21,630 --> 03:43:23,530
May is just my really, really busy month.

4708
03:43:23,930 --> 03:43:26,050
And then after May I'll be mostly good, I think.

4709
03:43:26,650 --> 03:43:27,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4710
03:43:27,770 --> 03:43:28,050
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4711
03:43:28,050 --> 03:43:28,490
Okay, I'll be fine.

4712
03:44:59,530 --> 03:44:59,810
Okay!

4713
03:45:00,470 --> 03:45:01,290
Okay, okay!

4714
03:45:02,010 --> 03:45:02,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4715
03:45:03,190 --> 03:45:03,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4716
03:45:03,810 --> 03:45:04,630
Oh, did I get a raid?

4717
03:45:04,790 --> 03:45:05,310
Thank you!

4718
03:45:05,590 --> 03:45:06,710
Thank you, whoever raided me.

4719
03:45:06,830 --> 03:45:07,230
Thank you!

4720
03:45:08,470 --> 03:45:09,710
Sorry, I went to go get some tea!

4721
03:45:22,710 --> 03:45:23,870
I did save, right?

4722
03:45:24,990 --> 03:45:25,930
I'll just save anyway.

4723
03:45:26,090 --> 03:45:26,250
Oh god.

4724
03:45:29,170 --> 03:45:29,830
What's here?

4725
03:45:30,450 --> 03:45:31,290
What's in here?

4726
03:45:33,290 --> 03:45:34,570
Oh, this is a bee man!

4727
03:45:35,970 --> 03:45:37,190
Shoot him in the butt.

4728
03:45:39,170 --> 03:45:39,610
Uh...

4729
03:45:39,610 --> 03:45:40,750
What do I want to use?

4730
03:45:42,530 --> 03:45:45,090
If I release the snarks...

4731
03:45:45,090 --> 03:45:45,990
Will it actually?

4732
03:45:51,330 --> 03:45:52,590
I don't think...

4733
03:45:52,590 --> 03:45:52,990
Oh...

4734
03:45:52,990 --> 03:45:54,310
I don't think that worked.

4735
03:45:55,590 --> 03:45:57,310
They turned on me!

4736
03:45:57,710 --> 03:45:59,110
They turned on me!

4737
03:46:01,750 --> 03:46:05,900
They turned on me!

4738
03:46:10,540 --> 03:46:11,600
Oh no!

4739
03:46:13,440 --> 03:46:14,820
That's so funny.

4740
03:46:15,540 --> 03:46:17,640
And terrifying and horrible at the same time.

4741
03:46:17,860 --> 03:46:17,940
Okay.

4742
03:46:22,180 --> 03:46:23,140
Oh my god, please.

4743
03:46:23,860 --> 03:46:24,820
Oh my god, I'm out!

4744
03:46:26,240 --> 03:46:26,980
Just kill me.

4745
03:46:27,180 --> 03:46:27,840
Just let me die.

4746
03:46:27,920 --> 03:46:28,280
Let me die.

4747
03:46:28,400 --> 03:46:28,620
Let me die.

4748
03:46:28,700 --> 03:46:29,940
Oh, I can just run past them.

4749
03:46:31,220 --> 03:46:31,980
Just let me die.

4750
03:46:32,180 --> 03:46:32,640
Just kill me.

4751
03:46:32,760 --> 03:46:33,160
Just kill me.

4752
03:46:33,320 --> 03:46:33,880
Just kill me.

4753
03:46:34,240 --> 03:46:35,000
Just kill me!

4754
03:46:36,740 --> 03:46:37,720
Yeah, I forgot to reload.

4755
03:46:39,260 --> 03:46:40,600
I forgot to reload!

4756
03:46:48,970 --> 03:46:51,690
Could I just run past them?

4757
03:46:55,810 --> 03:46:57,910
Do I even need to handle these guys?

4758
03:46:58,350 --> 03:46:59,210
You can try.

4759
03:47:02,770 --> 03:47:04,590
Just aim for the fleshy bits.

4760
03:47:06,270 --> 03:47:07,450
Like his arm?

4761
03:47:07,670 --> 03:47:08,250
His head?

4762
03:47:11,910 --> 03:47:13,170
Oh, damn!

4763
03:47:13,970 --> 03:47:15,190
That was smooth!

4764
03:47:18,870 --> 03:47:21,470
That actually ended up being so... not bad.

4765
03:47:21,610 --> 03:47:22,030
At all.

4766
03:47:22,690 --> 03:47:23,910
He didn't even notice!

4767
03:47:39,850 --> 03:47:44,750
I didn't need that, but it's nice to have.

4768
03:47:45,530 --> 03:47:46,850
Thank you very much.

4769
03:47:46,970 --> 03:47:47,350
What's this?

4770
03:47:48,670 --> 03:47:49,590
What was that?

4771
03:47:49,850 --> 03:47:50,750
Oh, more armor.

4772
03:47:55,400 --> 03:47:55,940
60%.

4773
03:47:55,940 --> 03:47:57,860
Okay.

4774
03:47:59,860 --> 03:48:03,980
We love you and would rather you take care of yourself than overwork yourself for us.

4775
03:48:04,180 --> 03:48:05,260
Please rest if you need to.

4776
03:48:06,520 --> 03:48:07,360
Stop it.

4777
03:48:07,640 --> 03:48:08,280
Thank you.

4778
03:48:08,560 --> 03:48:09,740
Only two bolts left, though.

4779
03:48:09,740 --> 03:48:10,200
I know.

4780
03:48:13,100 --> 03:48:17,220
I don't know what kind of final boss it is, so...

4781
03:48:17,220 --> 03:48:17,860
Whatever.

4782
03:48:19,040 --> 03:48:19,660
We'll see.

4783
03:48:30,120 --> 03:48:31,420
That's what I heard earlier!

4784
03:48:31,820 --> 03:48:32,880
That's what I heard, though!

4785
03:48:32,880 --> 03:48:33,980
I was like...

4786
03:48:34,680 --> 03:48:37,880
That's what I heard, and you guys said it was my suit going 15%.

4787
03:48:39,440 --> 03:48:39,880
No!

4788
03:48:40,700 --> 03:48:42,000
It was a...

4789
03:48:42,920 --> 03:48:45,200
It sounded like he's saying, You are not alone.

4790
03:48:45,240 --> 03:48:46,400
You are not alone.

4791
03:48:46,880 --> 03:48:48,420
That's what it sounded like he was saying.

4792
03:48:56,440 --> 03:48:57,320
Still sneaking.

4793
03:48:57,520 --> 03:48:58,480
I'm still sneaking.

4794
03:49:05,290 --> 03:49:06,930
I have five bullets.

4795
03:49:06,950 --> 03:49:07,510
That's it.

4796
03:49:07,730 --> 03:49:08,410
That's so sad.

4797
03:49:08,730 --> 03:49:09,310
What about this one?

4798
03:49:09,810 --> 03:49:11,050
Okay, we can reload this.

4799
03:49:23,190 --> 03:49:23,870
Oh, my God.

4800
03:49:23,870 --> 03:49:25,130
It's a whole society.

4801
03:49:26,310 --> 03:49:27,990
They live in a society.

4802
03:49:29,190 --> 03:49:29,970
Oh, come on.

4803
03:49:34,260 --> 03:49:36,300
You are not alone.

4804
03:49:36,720 --> 03:49:37,920
You are not alone.

4805
03:49:39,880 --> 03:49:42,620
They live like... It looks like a little beehive.

4806
03:49:47,860 --> 03:49:49,480
I don't want them to notice me.

4807
03:49:50,140 --> 03:49:51,220
Oh, they're talking.

4808
03:49:55,060 --> 03:49:56,380
Oh, my God.

4809
03:49:56,500 --> 03:49:56,680
Baby.

4810
03:50:06,760 --> 03:50:07,420
Come, baby.

4811
03:50:07,420 --> 03:50:07,500
Come, baby.

4812
03:50:08,720 --> 03:50:09,320
Mint, stop.

4813
03:50:09,620 --> 03:50:11,060
Oh, should I not have done that?

4814
03:50:15,590 --> 03:50:16,610
Oh, my gosh.

4815
03:50:16,710 --> 03:50:17,630
I finally get to see him.

4816
03:50:19,070 --> 03:50:19,510
Ew.

4817
03:50:19,510 --> 03:50:20,350
Omega My...

4818
03:50:20,350 --> 03:50:21,430
Oh, there he goes.

4819
03:50:24,510 --> 03:50:25,590
Peace is optional.

4820
03:50:25,590 --> 03:50:25,930
Wait.

4821
03:50:26,210 --> 03:50:27,510
Should I be... Should I...

4822
03:50:27,510 --> 03:50:28,670
Are they nice to me?

4823
03:50:31,410 --> 03:50:31,970
Oh.

4824
03:50:32,290 --> 03:50:32,710
Oh.

4825
03:50:36,210 --> 03:50:36,770
Oh.

4826
03:50:40,040 --> 03:50:40,660
There's more.

4827
03:50:42,140 --> 03:50:42,880
Not now.

4828
03:50:43,320 --> 03:50:43,660
Oh.

4829
03:50:43,980 --> 03:50:46,280
Should I not have killed their friends and family?

4830
03:50:47,160 --> 03:50:48,840
You're saying that's a bad idea?

4831
03:50:51,540 --> 03:50:52,320
Oh, God.

4832
03:50:52,780 --> 03:50:53,060
Okay.

4833
03:50:53,240 --> 03:50:53,820
Oh, oh, oh.

4834
03:50:53,960 --> 03:50:54,140
Hello.

4835
03:50:55,560 --> 03:50:56,820
Oh, he's not killing me.

4836
03:50:57,240 --> 03:50:58,900
Oh, he's just a worker bee.

4837
03:51:00,960 --> 03:51:02,120
He's a worker bee.

4838
03:51:02,120 --> 03:51:02,140
He's a worker bee.

4839
03:51:03,580 --> 03:51:04,020
Oh.

4840
03:51:04,680 --> 03:51:05,100
Oh.

4841
03:51:05,300 --> 03:51:06,100
I think I messed up.

4842
03:51:08,240 --> 03:51:09,400
Oh, I think I messed up.

4843
03:51:09,560 --> 03:51:10,420
Yeah, I'm gonna kill you.

4844
03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:12,660
I'll kill the baby, though.

4845
03:51:14,840 --> 03:51:16,260
Oh, there's many of them.

4846
03:51:16,480 --> 03:51:17,000
There's multiple.

4847
03:51:18,020 --> 03:51:18,460
Uh...

4848
03:51:18,460 --> 03:51:19,900
How do I...

4849
03:51:21,640 --> 03:51:22,080
Uh...

4850
03:51:22,080 --> 03:51:22,540
Redo!

4851
03:51:22,840 --> 03:51:23,220
Okay.

4852
03:51:30,190 --> 03:51:36,770
You alone, not you alone, not you alone.

4853
03:51:37,490 --> 03:51:39,070
Yeah, I'm not you alone.

4854
03:51:40,710 --> 03:51:41,670
That's not my name.

4855
03:51:41,910 --> 03:51:42,870
My name's MinPhantom.

4856
03:51:46,840 --> 03:51:48,580
Wow, I'm watching them work.

4857
03:51:48,800 --> 03:51:49,680
Look at them talking!

4858
03:51:49,680 --> 03:51:51,420
Oh, he's...

4859
03:51:56,800 --> 03:51:58,920
The work is too demanding!

4860
03:51:59,300 --> 03:52:00,120
That's what he says.

4861
03:52:00,840 --> 03:52:03,140
Okay, so I got a platform around here, I suppose?

4862
03:52:03,200 --> 03:52:04,540
Or, maybe not a platform.

4863
03:52:06,740 --> 03:52:07,300
Um...

4864
03:52:07,300 --> 03:52:08,940
But these don't seem like stairs.

4865
03:52:09,380 --> 03:52:09,840
Oh, wait!

4866
03:52:11,920 --> 03:52:12,480
Okay.

4867
03:52:13,040 --> 03:52:13,900
This is really...

4868
03:52:13,900 --> 03:52:15,440
This is triggering my trypophobia.

4869
03:52:17,660 --> 03:52:18,180
Oh!

4870
03:52:18,480 --> 03:52:19,120
Excuse me.

4871
03:52:21,960 --> 03:52:22,820
What's this?

4872
03:52:24,100 --> 03:52:24,620
Um...

4873
03:52:24,620 --> 03:52:25,040
Hold on.

4874
03:52:26,880 --> 03:52:27,400
Uh...

4875
03:52:27,400 --> 03:52:29,920
Maybe I need to go into there?

4876
03:52:30,300 --> 03:52:31,560
Let me look around, though.

4877
03:52:32,480 --> 03:52:35,340
This game kind of indirectly tells you here that...

4878
03:52:35,340 --> 03:52:40,560
The vortigons, zappy guys, are the slaves of the society forced to fight you under the control of the mine babies!

4879
03:52:42,100 --> 03:52:43,720
They're actually slaves to the babies!

4880
03:52:43,720 --> 03:52:44,480
To the bee men!

4881
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:45,560
Oh, my God!

4882
03:52:45,920 --> 03:52:47,920
The bee men are made in a factory!

4883
03:52:48,580 --> 03:52:50,400
This game doesn't give you too much to tell.

4884
03:52:50,580 --> 03:52:52,680
They're friendly here, and eventually they aren't.

4885
03:52:53,080 --> 03:52:54,420
Oh, my God!

4886
03:52:55,480 --> 03:52:55,960
No!

4887
03:52:56,820 --> 03:52:58,380
The poor little bees!

4888
03:52:58,940 --> 03:52:59,780
I mean, not bees.

4889
03:52:59,960 --> 03:53:00,720
Those guys suck.

4890
03:53:00,840 --> 03:53:03,380
But these guys are just little worker bees!

4891
03:53:04,240 --> 03:53:04,940
Oh, no!

4892
03:53:11,090 --> 03:53:13,050
Wait a second, I'm making sure...

4893
03:53:13,050 --> 03:53:14,410
Okay, I'm gonna go into the zappy tap.

4894
03:53:15,150 --> 03:53:15,890
Excuse me.

4895
03:53:18,950 --> 03:53:19,430
It...

4896
03:53:21,190 --> 03:53:22,150
Does nothing.

4897
03:53:22,790 --> 03:53:23,430
Okay, cool.

4898
03:53:26,330 --> 03:53:29,610
Just a lowly alien trying to provide for my family!

4899
03:53:32,310 --> 03:53:33,950
Oh, it's a healing pod!

4900
03:53:34,310 --> 03:53:35,670
I see, I see it.

4901
03:53:37,470 --> 03:53:39,050
How do I get up there, then?

4902
03:53:41,410 --> 03:53:42,110
Let's stop...

4903
03:53:42,110 --> 03:53:42,950
Wait, does this go higher?

4904
03:53:43,830 --> 03:53:45,050
Oh, my God!

4905
03:53:46,210 --> 03:53:47,350
I see now.

4906
03:53:49,010 --> 03:53:51,430
I've learned the errors of my ways!

4907
03:53:54,390 --> 03:53:54,990
Uh...

4908
03:53:54,990 --> 03:53:56,350
Oh, please don't go...

4909
03:53:57,950 --> 03:53:59,330
Oh, he's so fru...

4910
03:53:59,330 --> 03:54:00,530
He's frustrated!

4911
03:54:02,750 --> 03:54:03,870
He's like...

4912
03:54:03,870 --> 03:54:05,390
I can't take it anymore!

4913
03:54:06,530 --> 03:54:07,150
Wait!

4914
03:54:07,270 --> 03:54:08,110
What did I do?

4915
03:54:11,260 --> 03:54:12,230
What did I do?

4916
03:54:20,640 --> 03:54:22,100
I mocked them.

4917
03:54:23,220 --> 03:54:23,780
Okay, let's...

4918
03:54:23,780 --> 03:54:24,280
Okay, restart.

4919
03:54:28,670 --> 03:54:30,930
Not you alone...

4920
03:54:31,610 --> 03:54:32,030
Oh, hello.

4921
03:54:32,410 --> 03:54:32,710
Thank you.

4922
03:54:33,110 --> 03:54:34,410
He also uses it.

4923
03:54:34,550 --> 03:54:35,090
It's so cute!

4924
03:54:42,490 --> 03:54:43,290
Oh, hello.

4925
03:54:45,710 --> 03:54:47,090
Wait, uh...

4926
03:54:47,090 --> 03:54:47,590
Here?

4927
03:54:47,790 --> 03:54:48,730
Oh, no, this is the...

4928
03:54:48,730 --> 03:54:49,670
This is the pod.

4929
03:54:50,010 --> 03:54:51,290
The healing pod.

4930
03:54:51,610 --> 03:54:51,930
What?

4931
03:54:52,310 --> 03:54:53,670
How do I get up there?

4932
03:54:54,850 --> 03:54:56,130
I think I'm stupid.

4933
03:55:00,070 --> 03:55:00,710
What...

4934
03:55:00,710 --> 03:55:01,410
Can I...

4935
03:55:01,410 --> 03:55:01,990
Jump to?

4936
03:55:02,550 --> 03:55:03,490
From here?

4937
03:55:04,430 --> 03:55:05,070
What?

4938
03:55:06,650 --> 03:55:07,290
Eh?

4939
03:55:07,950 --> 03:55:08,950
The other part?

4940
03:55:09,110 --> 03:55:09,950
Stand on the arm?

4941
03:55:10,330 --> 03:55:11,430
Oh, I guess we could try that.

4942
03:55:17,140 --> 03:55:19,900
I thought about that, but I thought this would also go high enough.

4943
03:55:21,160 --> 03:55:21,680
Oh, wait.

4944
03:55:21,980 --> 03:55:22,240
Oh, okay.

4945
03:55:22,660 --> 03:55:24,340
And then...

4946
03:55:24,340 --> 03:55:25,260
Okay, okay.

4947
03:55:27,520 --> 03:55:28,060
No, no!

4948
03:55:28,460 --> 03:55:29,100
No, no, don't go!

4949
03:55:29,280 --> 03:55:30,680
Don't turn evil, please!

4950
03:55:32,960 --> 03:55:34,060
Mister, mister, mister!

4951
03:55:38,310 --> 03:55:39,090
This isn't...

4952
03:55:39,090 --> 03:55:39,650
This isn't...

4953
03:55:39,650 --> 03:55:39,990
This isn't like you!

4954
03:55:40,850 --> 03:55:41,670
Oh, my God!

4955
03:55:42,010 --> 03:55:42,550
Oh, my God!

4956
03:55:42,950 --> 03:55:43,690
Holy cow!

4957
03:55:44,070 --> 03:55:44,310
Okay.

4958
03:55:46,990 --> 03:55:47,430
Um...

4959
03:55:48,470 --> 03:55:48,910
I'm...

4960
03:55:48,910 --> 03:55:49,590
I'm going in!

4961
03:55:50,810 --> 03:55:52,790
I don't know what's in, but I'm going in.

4962
03:55:52,910 --> 03:55:53,310
Oh, no.

4963
03:55:53,450 --> 03:55:54,030
It's a drop.

4964
03:55:54,370 --> 03:55:55,410
Uh, maybe I shouldn't go in.

4965
03:55:55,850 --> 03:55:57,010
Wait, what's down there?

4966
03:55:58,210 --> 03:55:59,730
My goop, or...?

4967
03:56:00,750 --> 03:56:02,070
Do I go into the goop?

4968
03:56:02,850 --> 03:56:03,810
They're just into...

4969
03:56:03,810 --> 03:56:03,950
Oh!

4970
03:56:15,950 --> 03:56:18,230
I have such fragile...

4971
03:56:18,230 --> 03:56:19,730
My bones are made of...

4972
03:56:19,730 --> 03:56:21,630
My bones are made of...

4973
03:56:21,630 --> 03:56:22,530
Of paper!

4974
03:56:22,890 --> 03:56:23,510
Or glass!

4975
03:56:23,730 --> 03:56:25,250
And my skin is made of paper!

4976
03:56:29,670 --> 03:56:31,850
Saddest moments of all time.

4977
03:56:34,970 --> 03:56:36,250
I don't know which one to go...

4978
03:56:36,250 --> 03:56:37,090
I guess...

4979
03:56:37,830 --> 03:56:39,490
I can't tell which one is...

4980
03:56:39,490 --> 03:56:39,750
The...

4981
03:56:39,750 --> 03:56:40,990
Appropriate one to go into.

4982
03:56:43,090 --> 03:56:44,010
So we'll just...

4983
03:56:44,010 --> 03:56:45,170
I guess I'll go down...

4984
03:56:45,170 --> 03:56:45,810
The goop chute.

4985
03:56:48,710 --> 03:56:49,150
Okay.

4986
03:56:50,070 --> 03:56:50,510
Alright!

4987
03:56:51,350 --> 03:56:51,790
Alright!

4988
03:56:52,330 --> 03:56:52,930
Are the...

4989
03:56:52,930 --> 03:56:54,250
Are the bee men in this?

4990
03:56:54,450 --> 03:56:55,010
Are they...

4991
03:56:55,010 --> 03:56:56,310
Is this what the bee men are?

4992
03:57:02,470 --> 03:57:03,070
Yes!

4993
03:57:03,490 --> 03:57:03,730
Oh!

4994
03:57:05,630 --> 03:57:06,230
Oh!

4995
03:57:06,970 --> 03:57:07,570
Oh!

4996
03:57:07,570 --> 03:57:07,610
Oh!

4997
03:57:07,930 --> 03:57:07,950
Oh!

4998
03:57:07,950 --> 03:57:08,170
Oh!

4999
03:57:08,170 --> 03:57:09,050
I don't think this was a good idea.

5000
03:57:11,350 --> 03:57:11,950
Oh!

5001
03:57:12,110 --> 03:57:12,530
Oh goodness!

5002
03:57:12,810 --> 03:57:13,370
Oh gosh!

5003
03:57:15,610 --> 03:57:17,490
I don't wanna hurt you anymore!

5004
03:57:18,030 --> 03:57:19,070
But I will!

5005
03:57:20,110 --> 03:57:20,710
Oh!

5006
03:57:21,870 --> 03:57:22,470
Ouch!

5007
03:57:24,990 --> 03:57:25,890
Fine then!

5008
03:57:26,870 --> 03:57:27,330
Asshole!

5009
03:57:29,190 --> 03:57:29,790
Oh!

5010
03:57:38,790 --> 03:57:39,950
There's a baby too!

5011
03:57:44,280 --> 03:57:45,200
Holy cow!

5012
03:57:49,890 --> 03:57:52,070
I can't see them from so far away!

5013
03:57:52,870 --> 03:57:53,470
I'm trying to snipe them!

5014
03:57:55,530 --> 03:57:55,990
Oh!

5015
03:57:56,950 --> 03:57:57,610
Oh my gosh!

5016
03:57:57,730 --> 03:57:59,450
Luba, thank you so much for the...

5017
03:57:59,450 --> 03:57:59,790
Ah!

5018
03:58:01,130 --> 03:58:01,590
Super!

5019
03:58:02,070 --> 03:58:03,410
I took a lot of damage there.

5020
03:58:03,610 --> 03:58:03,910
Shoot!

5021
03:58:05,370 --> 03:58:06,190
Oh my god!

5022
03:58:07,670 --> 03:58:09,030
Oh, I'm gonna die here probably.

5023
03:58:10,670 --> 03:58:11,130
No!

5024
03:58:11,370 --> 03:58:12,250
There's so many babies!

5025
03:58:12,950 --> 03:58:14,210
And so many...

5026
03:58:14,210 --> 03:58:15,670
So many electric guys!

5027
03:58:17,590 --> 03:58:17,950
Woo!

5028
03:58:18,830 --> 03:58:19,490
Oh gosh!

5029
03:58:23,420 --> 03:58:24,700
Hope you're liking the game!

5030
03:58:24,860 --> 03:58:27,200
I love Half-Life 1 and it's expansions.

5031
03:58:27,280 --> 03:58:28,320
I replayed it recently.

5032
03:58:28,680 --> 03:58:30,640
Using Svenkoop with friends.

5033
03:58:31,280 --> 03:58:32,560
I don't know what that is, but...

5034
03:58:32,560 --> 03:58:33,020
No!

5035
03:58:33,780 --> 03:58:34,240
Ah!

5036
03:58:34,940 --> 03:58:36,420
It loaded so...

5037
03:58:36,420 --> 03:58:37,840
I thought that it had...

5038
03:58:37,840 --> 03:58:40,400
Like it loaded into that area, so I thought it had saved.

5039
03:58:41,460 --> 03:58:42,580
Aw, that sucks.

5040
03:58:47,520 --> 03:58:48,380
Aw, man.

5041
03:58:51,360 --> 03:58:52,960
I thought the goop was a save!

5042
03:58:53,200 --> 03:58:53,540
Yeah, me too!

5043
03:58:58,950 --> 03:59:01,650
It's a G mod for Half-Life.

5044
03:59:02,110 --> 03:59:02,450
I see.

5045
03:59:03,950 --> 03:59:04,930
Co-op client.

5046
03:59:05,170 --> 03:59:06,010
Ah, okay, okay.

5047
03:59:07,770 --> 03:59:09,570
Does this game not usually have co-op?

5048
03:59:09,690 --> 03:59:10,310
I thought it did.

5049
03:59:18,090 --> 03:59:18,570
Okay!

5050
03:59:19,010 --> 03:59:20,270
I'm gonna save here.

5051
03:59:20,410 --> 03:59:22,490
Maybe I want to go into this room instead.

5052
03:59:22,490 --> 03:59:22,710
But...

5053
03:59:22,710 --> 03:59:23,730
Maybe I want to go this way.

5054
03:59:23,870 --> 03:59:24,210
I don't know.

5055
03:59:25,030 --> 03:59:25,390
Let's...

5056
03:59:25,390 --> 03:59:26,750
Let's change it up a little.

5057
03:59:31,150 --> 03:59:31,590
Oh!

5058
03:59:31,790 --> 03:59:32,390
We're going up?

5059
03:59:32,830 --> 03:59:33,810
I'm not going up.

5060
03:59:34,130 --> 03:59:34,850
I'm gonna get crushed.

5061
03:59:35,750 --> 03:59:36,190
Uh...

5062
03:59:36,190 --> 03:59:36,970
Don't mind me.

5063
03:59:41,110 --> 03:59:41,550
Okay.

5064
03:59:42,690 --> 03:59:44,510
We're going into the goop chute.

5065
03:59:46,750 --> 03:59:49,010
Why does he say that every time I reload in?

5066
03:59:49,070 --> 03:59:49,750
It's so creepy!

5067
03:59:51,510 --> 03:59:51,950
Okay.

5068
03:59:58,290 --> 03:59:58,770
Alright.

5069
04:00:04,870 --> 04:00:06,530
I shot him in the back.

5070
04:00:06,870 --> 04:00:07,950
I'm sorry, mister!

5071
04:00:08,130 --> 04:00:08,510
I'm sorry!

5072
04:00:08,670 --> 04:00:09,650
Okay, I'm gonna get these guys...

5073
04:00:10,470 --> 04:00:10,950
First?

5074
04:00:16,180 --> 04:00:16,940
Oh my god.

5075
04:00:17,060 --> 04:00:17,900
I didn't see him up there.

5076
04:00:20,080 --> 04:00:20,560
Stupid.

5077
04:00:20,800 --> 04:00:21,500
Stupid baby.

5078
04:00:22,880 --> 04:00:23,200
Yeah.

5079
04:00:23,380 --> 04:00:24,200
Fall into the goop.

5080
04:00:25,480 --> 04:00:26,380
Baby alien.

5081
04:00:26,380 --> 04:00:26,540
Man.

5082
04:00:28,020 --> 04:00:29,460
I could've sworn there was a guy here.

5083
04:00:31,340 --> 04:00:32,880
Do I jump using these?

5084
04:00:33,100 --> 04:00:33,320
No.

5085
04:00:33,840 --> 04:00:34,520
Please say no.

5086
04:00:35,820 --> 04:00:37,120
Please say no!

5087
04:00:42,260 --> 04:00:43,160
I'm gonna save.

5088
04:00:43,520 --> 04:00:43,620
Okay.

5089
04:00:44,160 --> 04:00:44,360
Oop!

5090
04:00:44,560 --> 04:00:44,640
Oop!

5091
04:00:45,320 --> 04:00:45,480
Oop!

5092
04:00:45,760 --> 04:00:46,000
Ouch!

5093
04:00:46,480 --> 04:00:47,360
Did that really hurt me?

5094
04:00:52,560 --> 04:00:53,300
Oh my god!

5095
04:00:53,480 --> 04:00:53,660
Ah!

5096
04:00:56,660 --> 04:00:57,140
Please!

5097
04:00:57,840 --> 04:00:58,800
Oh god.

5098
04:01:02,640 --> 04:01:03,260
Baby.

5099
04:01:05,020 --> 04:01:05,640
Baby.

5100
04:01:06,340 --> 04:01:06,800
Baby.

5101
04:01:07,120 --> 04:01:07,740
Baby.

5102
04:01:08,060 --> 04:01:08,360
Baby, baby!

5103
04:01:08,600 --> 04:01:08,800
No!

5104
04:01:11,360 --> 04:01:12,840
I know, I hate these guys.

5105
04:01:13,200 --> 04:01:14,440
They're so awful.

5106
04:01:14,620 --> 04:01:14,900
Look at that.

5107
04:01:14,900 --> 04:01:15,600
They're all teaming up.

5108
04:01:15,700 --> 04:01:16,640
They're all talking together.

5109
04:01:19,080 --> 04:01:20,220
They're all talking.

5110
04:01:20,840 --> 04:01:22,360
They're scheming.

5111
04:01:22,580 --> 04:01:23,240
Oh my gosh.

5112
04:01:23,360 --> 04:01:23,920
Stop running.

5113
04:01:24,560 --> 04:01:26,040
Stop running and scheming.

5114
04:01:32,310 --> 04:01:33,430
Stop running!

5115
04:01:38,320 --> 04:01:39,100
What's up?

5116
04:01:40,140 --> 04:01:42,260
Do you guys know that...

5117
04:01:42,260 --> 04:01:43,660
There's like a...

5118
04:01:43,660 --> 04:01:45,300
A video of...

5119
04:01:46,340 --> 04:01:47,720
Of like a...

5120
04:01:47,720 --> 04:01:48,980
It's like a professor in...

5121
04:01:49,780 --> 04:01:50,700
A class.

5122
04:01:51,020 --> 04:01:53,120
And I guess it's like during when you know...

5123
04:01:53,120 --> 04:01:53,960
What like people...

5124
04:01:55,160 --> 04:01:56,000
Oh shoot!

5125
04:01:56,200 --> 04:01:57,600
I didn't realize that I was gonna get hit.

5126
04:01:58,340 --> 04:01:58,860
When...

5127
04:01:58,860 --> 04:01:59,060
Uh...

5128
04:01:59,060 --> 04:02:00,840
Classes were taught online and stuff.

5129
04:02:02,240 --> 04:02:02,760
And...

5130
04:02:03,680 --> 04:02:05,120
And there's one where the...

5131
04:02:05,120 --> 04:02:06,000
The professor's like...

5132
04:02:06,000 --> 04:02:06,880
Do you have any questions?

5133
04:02:06,940 --> 04:02:08,360
And this person has this like...

5134
04:02:08,360 --> 04:02:09,640
Alien voice mod on.

5135
04:02:09,780 --> 04:02:10,920
And it goes...

5136
04:02:10,920 --> 04:02:11,680
Blap blap.

5137
04:02:12,300 --> 04:02:13,740
Blap blap blap.

5138
04:02:13,940 --> 04:02:14,680
Blap blap blap.

5139
04:02:14,680 --> 04:02:15,980
Blap blap blap.

5140
04:02:17,100 --> 04:02:18,480
That's what the voice...

5141
04:02:18,480 --> 04:02:19,740
I'm hearing...

5142
04:02:20,520 --> 04:02:21,100
Sounds like.

5143
04:02:22,720 --> 04:02:24,200
I've wasted so many bullets.

5144
04:02:24,340 --> 04:02:25,340
I'm gonna have to redo this part.

5145
04:02:25,480 --> 04:02:25,740
It's okay.

5146
04:02:25,980 --> 04:02:26,480
Honestly.

5147
04:02:26,480 --> 04:02:27,340
Oh my gosh.

5148
04:02:27,620 --> 04:02:28,060
Baby!

5149
04:02:32,360 --> 04:02:34,960
Oh, there's a healing pod down there.

5150
04:02:39,260 --> 04:02:41,260
But honestly, I'm not concerned about my health...

5151
04:02:41,260 --> 04:02:42,540
As much as I am about...

5152
04:02:43,340 --> 04:02:44,220
My bullets.

5153
04:02:45,780 --> 04:02:46,600
My bu...

5154
04:02:46,600 --> 04:02:47,360
Oh no!

5155
04:02:47,760 --> 04:02:48,880
What did he cause a...

5156
04:02:48,880 --> 04:02:49,340
Okay.

5157
04:02:49,600 --> 04:02:51,200
I thought he caused a disrup...

5158
04:02:51,200 --> 04:02:52,520
Disruption in the...

5159
04:02:52,520 --> 04:02:54,440
In the flow of the...

5160
04:02:54,440 --> 04:02:55,460
How do we get down here though?

5161
04:02:58,560 --> 04:02:59,000
Um...

5162
04:02:59,000 --> 04:02:59,720
Can I just jump?

5163
04:03:04,240 --> 04:03:04,680
Uh...

5164
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:05,960
Save?

5165
04:03:07,360 --> 04:03:08,700
Yeah, I'll make a new save.

5166
04:03:08,860 --> 04:03:09,460
So that...

5167
04:03:21,290 --> 04:03:23,270
This area sucks, but it's the last stretch.

5168
04:03:23,470 --> 04:03:23,930
Yeah!

5169
04:03:24,550 --> 04:03:24,910
Yeah!

5170
04:03:30,890 --> 04:03:31,810
That's the...

5171
04:03:31,810 --> 04:03:32,630
Oh, what is that?

5172
04:03:32,890 --> 04:03:33,130
Okay.

5173
04:03:40,310 --> 04:03:40,790
Bubble?

5174
04:03:41,350 --> 04:03:41,830
Where?

5175
04:03:42,010 --> 04:03:42,570
Where are you?

5176
04:03:45,090 --> 04:03:46,010
Is that a guy?

5177
04:03:47,490 --> 04:03:48,230
Oh my god!

5178
04:03:48,370 --> 04:03:48,530
Friend!

5179
04:03:48,890 --> 04:03:49,530
What is this?

5180
04:03:52,310 --> 04:03:52,790
Nothing?

5181
04:03:53,070 --> 04:03:53,350
Okay.

5182
04:03:54,850 --> 04:03:55,230
Save.

5183
04:03:55,470 --> 04:03:56,190
Save on the save one.

5184
04:03:56,190 --> 04:03:56,870
Alright.

5185
04:03:58,130 --> 04:03:58,310
Huh.

5186
04:04:07,510 --> 04:04:08,330
Uh...

5187
04:04:09,020 --> 04:04:09,430
Okay.

5188
04:04:11,210 --> 04:04:12,990
You son of a gun!

5189
04:04:14,720 --> 04:04:15,130
Yeah!

5190
04:04:16,920 --> 04:04:18,010
Let's see...

5191
04:04:18,010 --> 04:04:18,770
Do I...

5192
04:04:18,770 --> 04:04:19,630
I guess...

5193
04:04:19,630 --> 04:04:21,150
How do I get back upstairs?

5194
04:04:24,270 --> 04:04:25,090
Um...

5195
04:04:25,090 --> 04:04:26,730
That's the better question.

5196
04:04:27,920 --> 04:04:29,170
How do I get back up...

5197
04:04:29,170 --> 04:04:29,630
Is it this?

5198
04:04:29,630 --> 04:04:30,690
Is this like a little elevator?

5199
04:04:31,550 --> 04:04:32,430
Oh-ho!

5200
04:04:32,870 --> 04:04:33,770
I knew!

5201
04:04:34,290 --> 04:04:35,650
I was like, it's a different color...

5202
04:04:36,270 --> 04:04:37,630
For a reason...

5203
04:04:38,290 --> 04:04:38,770
Okay.

5204
04:04:39,810 --> 04:04:40,330
Alright.

5205
04:04:41,630 --> 04:04:43,470
Just don't open any of the containers.

5206
04:04:43,870 --> 04:04:45,450
I wasn't planning on it!

5207
04:04:50,590 --> 04:04:51,110
Okay.

5208
04:04:52,590 --> 04:04:53,390
Another one?

5209
04:04:55,390 --> 04:04:56,490
Where'd you come from, baby?

5210
04:04:57,470 --> 04:04:57,810
Yeah.

5211
04:04:58,790 --> 04:04:59,630
Where'd you come from?

5212
04:04:59,730 --> 04:05:00,790
I sound like I'm hitting on him.

5213
04:05:02,150 --> 04:05:02,550
Oh my god.

5214
04:05:02,690 --> 04:05:02,850
Please.

5215
04:05:03,490 --> 04:05:04,070
Oh no.

5216
04:05:05,050 --> 04:05:05,490
No, no, no.

5217
04:05:06,530 --> 04:05:07,230
Oh my god.

5218
04:05:07,350 --> 04:05:07,590
Ouch!

5219
04:05:12,350 --> 04:05:13,650
At least there's...

5220
04:05:14,090 --> 04:05:15,450
At least there's...

5221
04:05:16,410 --> 04:05:17,930
Towers in this to...

5222
04:05:18,410 --> 04:05:19,710
To hide behind and stuff.

5223
04:05:20,590 --> 04:05:21,730
I'm hitting on him.

5224
04:05:21,850 --> 04:05:22,770
Where'd you come from, baby?

5225
04:05:22,770 --> 04:05:23,130
Yeah.

5226
04:05:24,130 --> 04:05:24,690
Yeah.

5227
04:05:31,210 --> 04:05:31,770
Okay.

5228
04:05:32,610 --> 04:05:33,490
I think...

5229
04:05:34,450 --> 04:05:35,490
Where's he coming from?

5230
04:05:36,290 --> 04:05:36,850
Where?

5231
04:05:38,510 --> 04:05:39,070
Where?

5232
04:05:39,450 --> 04:05:40,190
I can't...

5233
04:05:40,190 --> 04:05:40,730
I can't tell.

5234
04:05:40,970 --> 04:05:41,610
Up there?

5235
04:05:42,050 --> 04:05:42,770
Oh yeah.

5236
04:05:44,390 --> 04:05:45,330
Oh, dang it.

5237
04:05:45,510 --> 04:05:45,910
It's fine.

5238
04:05:46,030 --> 04:05:46,550
Just leave him alone.

5239
04:05:48,930 --> 04:05:50,130
Oh, this goes down.

5240
04:05:50,350 --> 04:05:50,550
Oh, this goes down.

5241
04:05:50,550 --> 04:05:50,610
Okay.

5242
04:05:51,130 --> 04:05:51,290
Okay.

5243
04:06:00,350 --> 04:06:00,790
Golly.

5244
04:06:02,270 --> 04:06:03,210
I can't remember.

5245
04:06:03,330 --> 04:06:05,310
What did we say that they sounded like they were saying?

5246
04:06:05,570 --> 04:06:07,150
It doesn't sound like it anymore to me.

5247
04:06:07,570 --> 04:06:08,690
I can't remember.

5248
04:06:09,750 --> 04:06:11,650
It was like something's really silly.

5249
04:06:12,370 --> 04:06:13,410
The guys.

5250
04:06:13,790 --> 04:06:14,070
Oh yeah.

5251
04:06:14,170 --> 04:06:15,050
Booty shot.

5252
04:06:15,510 --> 04:06:16,190
Booty shot.

5253
04:06:17,870 --> 04:06:19,310
That's what it sounded like.

5254
04:06:19,470 --> 04:06:20,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5255
04:06:20,510 --> 04:06:21,470
Booty shot.

5256
04:06:21,710 --> 04:06:22,350
Booty shot.

5257
04:06:23,550 --> 04:06:24,650
I hear it now.

5258
04:06:25,690 --> 04:06:26,870
I hear it again.

5259
04:06:30,780 --> 04:06:31,740
Booty shot.

5260
04:06:32,040 --> 04:06:32,680
Booty shot.

5261
04:06:36,280 --> 04:06:37,320
Oh, uh oh.

5262
04:06:37,640 --> 04:06:37,800
Okay.

5263
04:06:37,860 --> 04:06:38,960
I'm in trouble now.

5264
04:06:39,180 --> 04:06:39,740
Okay, let's...

5265
04:06:39,740 --> 04:06:40,920
Oh, I'm in real trouble now.

5266
04:06:45,460 --> 04:06:47,320
Oh, boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop.

5267
04:06:51,380 --> 04:06:52,320
Oh my God.

5268
04:06:52,860 --> 04:06:53,460
Let me aim.

5269
04:06:54,100 --> 04:06:55,440
For your big ol' head.

5270
04:06:55,920 --> 04:06:56,660
And we're out.

5271
04:06:57,020 --> 04:06:57,240
Okay.

5272
04:06:57,640 --> 04:06:58,160
Uh...

5273
04:07:02,140 --> 04:07:03,660
The bees don't use ammo.

5274
04:07:03,840 --> 04:07:05,440
Do they attack the guys?

5275
04:07:05,760 --> 04:07:06,320
I can't remember.

5276
04:07:06,640 --> 04:07:07,440
Booty shot.

5277
04:07:07,720 --> 04:07:08,360
Booty shot.

5278
04:07:13,380 --> 04:07:13,700
Booty shot.

5279
04:07:13,700 --> 04:07:14,100
Oh, I hear them.

5280
04:07:14,260 --> 04:07:15,020
Yeah, they are getting hurt.

5281
04:07:15,360 --> 04:07:15,740
Okay, hold on.

5282
04:07:15,860 --> 04:07:16,620
I'm gonna...

5283
04:07:17,280 --> 04:07:18,320
I will save here.

5284
04:07:18,500 --> 04:07:19,140
I will click save.

5285
04:07:19,400 --> 04:07:19,700
It's fine.

5286
04:07:22,280 --> 04:07:23,360
Wait, maybe if I...

5287
04:07:24,880 --> 04:07:25,600
Did it kill him?

5288
04:07:30,740 --> 04:07:31,520
Oh, I guess it did.

5289
04:07:31,520 --> 04:07:32,220
Okay, cool.

5290
04:07:33,020 --> 04:07:34,060
Booty shot.

5291
04:07:34,400 --> 04:07:35,060
Booty shot.

5292
04:07:35,720 --> 04:07:36,320
Booty shot.

5293
04:07:41,150 --> 04:07:42,190
Booty shot.

5294
04:07:44,190 --> 04:07:45,190
What's all this?

5295
04:07:46,250 --> 04:07:48,130
It's not ammo that I need.

5296
04:07:53,420 --> 04:07:54,560
Ammo I need here?

5297
04:07:55,320 --> 04:07:56,740
I wish I could move this.

5298
04:07:57,040 --> 04:07:58,440
Wait, there's like something behind here.

5299
04:07:58,440 --> 04:07:59,440
It's like a...

5300
04:08:00,720 --> 04:08:01,800
Wait, what's over there?

5301
04:08:02,060 --> 04:08:03,000
What's that over there?

5302
04:08:03,060 --> 04:08:04,260
This is all secret passage.

5303
04:08:08,080 --> 04:08:09,580
Don't break any of the barrels.

5304
04:08:25,900 --> 04:08:26,540
Break the barrels.

5305
04:08:26,540 --> 04:08:26,880
Got him.

5306
04:08:29,280 --> 04:08:30,400
Break the barrels.

5307
04:08:31,920 --> 04:08:33,200
I could, uh...

5308
04:08:33,200 --> 04:08:33,600
Let's see.

5309
04:08:33,900 --> 04:08:34,440
Hold on.

5310
04:08:35,940 --> 04:08:37,000
Let's do this.

5311
04:08:39,160 --> 04:08:40,160
And then...

5312
04:08:40,160 --> 04:08:41,240
I'll put a second one.

5313
04:08:47,630 --> 04:08:50,110
Oh, whatever was in there also got exploded.

5314
04:08:52,430 --> 04:08:53,170
Never mind.

5315
04:08:53,470 --> 04:08:54,450
He didn't get exploded.

5316
04:09:08,320 --> 04:09:09,300
Booty shot.

5317
04:09:09,540 --> 04:09:10,460
Booty shot.

5318
04:09:13,040 --> 04:09:14,460
You blew up more than one?

5319
04:09:14,660 --> 04:09:15,040
I did?

5320
04:09:15,160 --> 04:09:15,560
No way.

5321
04:09:16,000 --> 04:09:16,840
Are we in trouble?

5322
04:09:19,400 --> 04:09:20,900
Oh, we did, but...

5323
04:09:20,900 --> 04:09:21,360
Oh, I see.

5324
04:09:21,500 --> 04:09:22,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5325
04:09:22,660 --> 04:09:24,620
It exploded a different one too.

5326
04:09:24,980 --> 04:09:25,140
Ah.

5327
04:09:26,340 --> 04:09:27,480
What is in here anyway?

5328
04:09:27,660 --> 04:09:28,180
Better be good.

5329
04:09:28,680 --> 04:09:29,860
It's just a shortcut.

5330
04:09:36,340 --> 04:09:37,460
Yeah, it's just a...

5331
04:09:37,460 --> 04:09:38,440
It's just a...

5332
04:09:39,560 --> 04:09:40,040
Um...

5333
04:09:40,540 --> 04:09:45,800
For everybody who's curious of the like-minded curious community such as me.

5334
04:09:51,210 --> 04:09:52,010
I just...

5335
04:09:52,010 --> 04:09:53,310
I just answered your question.

5336
04:09:53,590 --> 04:09:55,270
I solved all your questions.

5337
04:09:55,390 --> 04:09:55,530
Oh!

5338
04:09:56,070 --> 04:09:57,150
I don't need health.

5339
04:09:57,450 --> 04:09:59,030
I think there's a guy like right behind this.

5340
04:10:00,090 --> 04:10:02,470
Actually, since I'm getting so close to them, might as well use...

5341
04:10:04,330 --> 04:10:05,050
Oh, no?

5342
04:10:05,290 --> 04:10:05,590
Maybe not.

5343
04:10:05,890 --> 04:10:06,010
Okay.

5344
04:10:06,350 --> 04:10:07,770
It's giving us a lot of health and stuff.

5345
04:10:10,070 --> 04:10:10,510
Okay.

5346
04:10:12,070 --> 04:10:13,070
Thank you, Minto.

5347
04:10:13,370 --> 04:10:14,390
You are so...

5348
04:10:14,890 --> 04:10:15,330
Welcome.

5349
04:10:16,790 --> 04:10:17,470
Um...

5350
04:10:22,950 --> 04:10:24,170
Holy cow.

5351
04:10:24,770 --> 04:10:25,270
No!

5352
04:10:28,170 --> 04:10:28,950
Booty shot!

5353
04:10:34,580 --> 04:10:35,260
Yeah!

5354
04:10:35,580 --> 04:10:36,040
Take that!

5355
04:10:36,900 --> 04:10:38,300
And we're getting more stuff here.

5356
04:10:38,860 --> 04:10:39,880
Oh, that's a bunch of C4.

5357
04:10:43,100 --> 04:10:43,780
Uh...

5358
04:10:43,780 --> 04:10:46,180
Surely they gave us...

5359
04:10:46,180 --> 04:10:47,100
Um...

5360
04:10:47,100 --> 04:10:47,360
Nope.

5361
04:10:48,260 --> 04:10:49,160
Surely they...

5362
04:10:49,160 --> 04:10:49,580
Uh, nope.

5363
04:10:49,580 --> 04:10:52,640
Anything that I used, they didn't give us a single thing of.

5364
04:10:52,900 --> 04:10:53,440
That's okay.

5365
04:10:54,620 --> 04:10:55,460
That's fine.

5366
04:10:55,660 --> 04:10:56,060
Probably.

5367
04:10:59,860 --> 04:11:00,640
SMG grenades?

5368
04:11:00,800 --> 04:11:00,880
Oh!

5369
04:11:01,300 --> 04:11:01,960
That's good.

5370
04:11:02,220 --> 04:11:03,040
That's actually pretty big.

5371
04:11:04,100 --> 04:11:04,640
Wait, hold on.

5372
04:11:06,120 --> 04:11:06,440
Okay.

5373
04:11:11,290 --> 04:11:11,810
Oh!

5374
04:11:12,070 --> 04:11:13,490
I didn't even notice you up there.

5375
04:11:14,530 --> 04:11:15,610
Time to use...

5376
04:11:15,610 --> 04:11:16,990
More C4.

5377
04:11:16,990 --> 04:11:17,390
More C4.

5378
04:11:22,170 --> 04:11:22,570
Uh...

5379
04:11:22,570 --> 04:11:23,930
Can you come down, please?

5380
04:11:25,390 --> 04:11:26,410
Can you come down?

5381
04:11:27,270 --> 04:11:27,450
Oh!

5382
04:11:27,550 --> 04:11:28,770
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.

5383
04:11:35,250 --> 04:11:35,650
Please?

5384
04:11:36,490 --> 04:11:37,270
Okay, I got him.

5385
04:11:40,070 --> 04:11:40,650
Oh no!

5386
04:11:40,730 --> 04:11:42,430
I have to destroy this, don't I?

5387
04:11:46,190 --> 04:11:48,350
I have to destroy this, don't I?

5388
04:11:50,550 --> 04:11:51,470
Oh, shoot.

5389
04:11:51,930 --> 04:11:54,110
Time to leave, like, five C4s.

5390
04:11:55,110 --> 04:11:58,070
You've been my travel buddy since I went out at 11 a.m.?

5391
04:11:58,070 --> 04:11:58,750
Welcome home!

5392
04:12:09,930 --> 04:12:10,630
Oh, no.

5393
04:12:12,410 --> 04:12:12,890
No!

5394
04:12:14,430 --> 04:12:15,870
You can jump on it.

5395
04:12:15,970 --> 04:12:16,430
I'm trying.

5396
04:12:23,830 --> 04:12:25,190
Oh, I did it!

5397
04:12:26,090 --> 04:12:26,950
I'm a gamer.

5398
04:12:27,270 --> 04:12:27,910
I'm a gamer.

5399
04:12:28,190 --> 04:12:28,930
I'm a gamer!

5400
04:12:30,830 --> 04:12:31,670
Okay, cool.

5401
04:12:34,390 --> 04:12:35,350
Oh, reload.

5402
04:12:38,290 --> 04:12:40,090
Your Honor, shoot a game.

5403
04:12:42,550 --> 04:12:43,110
Oh.

5404
04:12:44,230 --> 04:12:44,790
Okay.

5405
04:12:46,590 --> 04:12:50,390
Someone is, like, for real having a crazy conversation in here.

5406
04:12:53,090 --> 04:12:54,010
Oh, my gosh.

5407
04:12:54,330 --> 04:12:54,930
Oh, my gosh.

5408
04:12:55,150 --> 04:12:56,130
Oh, my gosh.

5409
04:12:56,370 --> 04:12:57,310
Oh, my gosh.

5410
04:12:57,690 --> 04:12:58,870
Oh, shoot!

5411
04:13:01,770 --> 04:13:02,890
Let's, uh...

5412
04:13:02,890 --> 04:13:06,810
I had to double check if I was pressing load or save.

5413
04:13:10,170 --> 04:13:11,690
This looks like doom now.

5414
04:13:11,810 --> 04:13:12,770
I know, right?

5415
04:13:12,770 --> 04:13:13,650
It really does.

5416
04:13:13,970 --> 04:13:14,950
It feels like doom.

5417
04:13:15,450 --> 04:13:16,730
Let's do the bees instead.

5418
04:13:22,730 --> 04:13:24,270
Yeah, let's do the bees instead.

5419
04:13:37,690 --> 04:13:38,090
Oh!

5420
04:13:38,570 --> 04:13:38,730
Oh.

5421
04:13:39,530 --> 04:13:41,110
That didn't work out so well for me.

5422
04:13:43,170 --> 04:13:45,750
Okay, I think I have to take care of the...

5423
04:13:45,750 --> 04:13:47,930
the electric guys first.

5424
04:13:49,030 --> 04:13:51,270
I need to take out the electric guys first.

5425
04:13:51,270 --> 04:13:52,310
And then...

5426
04:14:00,430 --> 04:14:01,910
But, like, make sure I don't...

5427
04:14:01,910 --> 04:14:02,790
Yeah, do that.

5428
04:14:02,890 --> 04:14:03,490
Okay, there we go.

5429
04:14:03,830 --> 04:14:04,150
And...

5430
04:14:05,950 --> 04:14:06,590
And then...

5431
04:14:06,990 --> 04:14:07,610
Then bees.

5432
04:14:23,240 --> 04:14:24,200
I think I got one.

5433
04:14:24,320 --> 04:14:24,440
No?

5434
04:14:24,560 --> 04:14:24,880
Just kidding.

5435
04:14:37,850 --> 04:14:38,430
Please die.

5436
04:14:38,670 --> 04:14:39,050
Oh, my God.

5437
04:14:39,070 --> 04:14:39,630
Please die.

5438
04:14:40,190 --> 04:14:40,510
Yes!

5439
04:14:40,970 --> 04:14:41,290
Oh!

5440
04:14:43,710 --> 04:14:44,150
That

5441
04:14:48,880 --> 04:14:50,020
just grazed me!

5442
04:14:50,180 --> 04:14:50,480
Oh, my God!

5443
04:14:50,600 --> 04:14:51,420
It did so much damage!

5444
04:14:51,640 --> 04:14:52,460
It grazed me!

5445
04:14:58,110 --> 04:14:59,450
I wonder if I should have...

5446
04:15:00,150 --> 04:15:01,490
I wonder if I should try again.

5447
04:15:05,150 --> 04:15:06,030
My friend.

5448
04:15:06,070 --> 04:15:06,890
My pal.

5449
04:15:07,350 --> 04:15:08,090
What is this?

5450
04:15:09,190 --> 04:15:09,630
Wait.

5451
04:15:09,850 --> 04:15:11,070
Oh, but there's a healing thing.

5452
04:15:13,550 --> 04:15:14,790
Nah, we're fine.

5453
04:15:15,090 --> 04:15:16,050
We got the healing thing.

5454
04:15:16,050 --> 04:15:17,790
I have no armor anyway.

5455
04:15:18,110 --> 04:15:18,890
I don't think.

5456
04:15:26,530 --> 04:15:30,670
The bee gun does have alt fire, but it is not the homing bees.

5457
04:15:30,950 --> 04:15:31,590
It's like the...

5458
04:15:32,150 --> 04:15:32,970
The bees.

5459
04:15:33,430 --> 04:15:33,890
They...

5460
04:15:33,890 --> 04:15:34,610
They...

5461
04:15:34,610 --> 04:15:35,670
The bees.

5462
04:15:35,930 --> 04:15:36,810
I had, like, 30?

5463
04:15:38,810 --> 04:15:39,490
We'll see.

5464
04:15:40,470 --> 04:15:41,590
Barely none, yeah.

5465
04:15:47,810 --> 04:15:48,330
Okay.

5466
04:15:51,330 --> 04:15:53,210
I wish there was some health in here.

5467
04:15:54,450 --> 04:15:55,690
But, alas.

5468
04:15:56,010 --> 04:15:57,930
We must crawl into...

5469
04:15:57,930 --> 04:15:59,510
This red hole.

5470
04:15:59,710 --> 04:16:00,190
I'm gonna...

5471
04:16:00,190 --> 04:16:00,950
I'll make a new save.

5472
04:16:06,790 --> 04:16:07,390
Oh.

5473
04:16:08,750 --> 04:16:09,350
Oh.

5474
04:16:10,870 --> 04:16:12,130
Oh, I don't like that.

5475
04:16:12,410 --> 04:16:12,610
Okay.

5476
04:16:13,750 --> 04:16:14,710
Where are they?

5477
04:16:19,060 --> 04:16:20,100
Booty shot.

5478
04:16:20,360 --> 04:16:21,140
Booty shot.

5479
04:16:22,800 --> 04:16:23,800
Where are they?

5480
04:16:23,860 --> 04:16:24,380
I hear them.

5481
04:16:25,780 --> 04:16:27,520
The fun continues.

5482
04:16:27,980 --> 04:16:28,000
The fun continues.

5483
04:16:28,000 --> 04:16:28,680
Of course.

5484
04:16:32,020 --> 04:16:33,560
Maybe they're in the walls.

5485
04:16:38,080 --> 04:16:39,540
They're in the walls.

5486
04:16:42,060 --> 04:16:42,900
Okay.

5487
04:16:44,020 --> 04:16:44,600
Alright.

5488
04:16:50,300 --> 04:16:51,140
Uh.

5489
04:16:52,620 --> 04:16:52,960
Uh.

5490
04:16:53,120 --> 04:16:53,860
Pick your poison.

5491
04:16:57,000 --> 04:16:58,560
I guess they go to the same...

5492
04:16:58,560 --> 04:17:00,620
Why do they make things like this?

5493
04:17:01,700 --> 04:17:03,120
No, I'm in the walls.

5494
04:17:03,340 --> 04:17:03,760
Hahaha.

5495
04:17:05,400 --> 04:17:06,440
It goes to the same place.

5496
04:17:06,540 --> 04:17:08,060
Why do they have two openings, then?

5497
04:17:11,950 --> 04:17:12,830
Drop my...

5498
04:17:12,830 --> 04:17:13,050
Wait.

5499
04:17:13,190 --> 04:17:14,650
I don't think the bugs will work, though.

5500
04:17:16,330 --> 04:17:18,130
I don't think the bugs will work.

5501
04:17:18,430 --> 04:17:18,570
They...

5502
04:17:18,570 --> 04:17:18,930
They...

5503
04:17:18,930 --> 04:17:20,350
They don't attack the people...

5504
04:17:20,890 --> 04:17:21,750
In here, do they?

5505
04:17:22,270 --> 04:17:24,590
They don't attack the guys in here, right?

5506
04:17:25,530 --> 04:17:27,690
The snarks will not work, you know.

5507
04:17:28,770 --> 04:17:29,330
Unfortunately.

5508
04:17:34,390 --> 04:17:35,490
Only humans.

5509
04:17:37,210 --> 04:17:38,830
The snarks always work.

5510
04:17:38,870 --> 04:17:39,510
What do you mean?

5511
04:17:39,710 --> 04:17:40,010
Hahaha.

5512
04:17:40,310 --> 04:17:40,530
Yeah.

5513
04:17:41,070 --> 04:17:42,490
They've never once let me down.

5514
04:17:45,790 --> 04:17:46,630
Oh, gosh.

5515
04:17:46,910 --> 04:17:47,870
There's so many...

5516
04:17:47,870 --> 04:17:48,850
I can hear everything.

5517
04:17:52,490 --> 04:17:53,050
It's...

5518
04:17:53,050 --> 04:17:53,730
It's...

5519
04:17:53,730 --> 04:17:54,510
It sounds...

5520
04:17:54,510 --> 04:17:55,490
Like it won't be good.

5521
04:17:55,890 --> 04:17:56,210
Hahaha.

5522
04:17:57,050 --> 04:17:58,850
It doesn't sound like it will be good.

5523
04:18:03,210 --> 04:18:04,830
I only have 50 ammo.

5524
04:18:08,210 --> 04:18:09,170
Good time to save.

5525
04:18:09,290 --> 04:18:09,910
I'll just save.

5526
04:18:10,030 --> 04:18:10,570
I'll save again.

5527
04:18:14,430 --> 04:18:14,850
Just...

5528
04:18:14,850 --> 04:18:16,610
Let's just drop down and see what the...

5529
04:18:16,610 --> 04:18:17,390
What the damage is.

5530
04:18:21,650 --> 04:18:23,590
I'm running, running, I'm running, running.

5531
04:18:26,010 --> 04:18:26,850
Oh, my God.

5532
04:18:27,550 --> 04:18:28,170
Oh, my God.

5533
04:18:28,230 --> 04:18:29,350
It really feels like doom right now.

5534
04:18:29,710 --> 04:18:30,110
Hahaha.

5535
04:18:30,310 --> 04:18:30,910
Feels like doom.

5536
04:18:31,090 --> 04:18:31,690
Like crazy.

5537
04:18:31,830 --> 04:18:32,050
Ouch!

5538
04:18:35,670 --> 04:18:36,110
Hahaha.

5539
04:18:38,410 --> 04:18:40,050
Feels like doom like crazy right now.

5540
04:18:45,130 --> 04:18:45,630
Can't you see?

5541
04:18:46,830 --> 04:18:47,330
Okay.

5542
04:18:53,130 --> 04:18:55,070
Can this heal any slower?

5543
04:18:55,690 --> 04:18:56,410
Okay, there we go.

5544
04:18:56,630 --> 04:18:56,730
Okay.

5545
04:18:57,810 --> 04:18:57,990
Okay.

5546
04:18:57,990 --> 04:19:01,810
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

5547
04:19:03,930 --> 04:19:04,390
Oops.

5548
04:19:05,270 --> 04:19:06,030
Oh, come on.

5549
04:19:12,020 --> 04:19:18,540
How about... Oh, I only have five left.

5550
04:19:18,980 --> 04:19:20,620
This might be a good place to use them, though.

5551
04:19:22,600 --> 04:19:24,220
Use them or lose them.

5552
04:19:25,900 --> 04:19:26,360
Maybe.

5553
04:19:27,680 --> 04:19:28,140
Bees?

5554
04:19:28,340 --> 04:19:29,060
Oh, okay.

5555
04:19:29,300 --> 04:19:29,860
Maybe bees.

5556
04:19:30,720 --> 04:19:31,340
I don't know.

5557
04:19:31,760 --> 04:19:32,460
I don't know.

5558
04:19:44,980 --> 04:19:46,500
Oh, we got a guy.

5559
04:19:47,080 --> 04:19:47,700
Yeah.

5560
04:19:49,400 --> 04:19:50,720
Booty shot.

5561
04:19:50,960 --> 04:19:51,860
Booty shot.

5562
04:19:53,580 --> 04:20:01,860
Is he... Is he stuck down there, or... Get his butt.

5563
04:20:06,360 --> 04:20:06,960
Get his butt.

5564
04:20:06,960 --> 04:20:07,460
Come on.

5565
04:20:08,960 --> 04:20:10,040
Yeah, come on.

5566
04:20:10,140 --> 04:20:10,680
Get his butt.

5567
04:20:13,780 --> 04:20:14,380
Woo!

5568
04:20:14,380 --> 04:20:16,040
That was a crazy dodge.

5569
04:20:17,860 --> 04:20:18,740
Did he die?

5570
04:20:18,920 --> 04:20:19,320
I think so.

5571
04:20:26,070 --> 04:20:26,670
Um.

5572
04:20:26,670 --> 04:20:28,170
I heard someone up there.

5573
04:20:30,590 --> 04:20:31,650
He's quiet.

5574
04:20:33,170 --> 04:20:33,730
Oh!

5575
04:20:33,910 --> 04:20:34,290
Oh!

5576
04:20:34,550 --> 04:20:35,870
Oh, please!

5577
04:20:40,820 --> 04:20:42,700
I think we did it, guys!

5578
04:20:45,560 --> 04:20:47,060
I think we did it, guys!

5579
04:20:47,180 --> 04:20:47,400
I think we did it, guys!

5580
04:20:47,400 --> 04:20:48,340
If we...

5581
04:20:48,340 --> 04:20:48,740
Oh.

5582
04:20:49,000 --> 04:20:49,420
Okay.

5583
04:20:50,640 --> 04:20:51,580
Booty shot.

5584
04:20:51,800 --> 04:20:52,180
Booty!

5585
04:20:54,620 --> 04:20:56,760
Here's someone else...

5586
04:20:56,760 --> 04:21:00,120
Come on, come... uh... There we go.

5587
04:21:00,240 --> 04:21:00,860
Oh, no!

5588
04:21:01,100 --> 04:21:02,540
There's still another baby!

5589
04:21:03,120 --> 04:21:04,460
Oh, the baby!

5590
04:21:09,300 --> 04:21:10,540
This is not good.

5591
04:21:15,380 --> 04:21:18,400
The baby's back, the baby's back, the baby's back, the baby's back, the baby's...

5592
04:21:18,400 --> 04:21:20,440
The baby's back, the baby's... Okay.

5593
04:21:20,920 --> 04:21:22,660
I don't think I should be using this weapon anymore.

5594
04:21:23,460 --> 04:21:24,560
Um... Oh my god.

5595
04:21:26,420 --> 04:21:27,440
I'm almost dead.

5596
04:21:29,120 --> 04:21:30,180
I'm almost dead.

5597
04:21:31,460 --> 04:21:32,480
This is pretty bad.

5598
04:21:33,160 --> 04:21:34,260
This is pretty bad.

5599
04:21:37,680 --> 04:21:41,720
Sniping with my... with my... with my... oh my god.

5600
04:21:42,480 --> 04:21:43,420
With my shotgun.

5601
04:21:44,340 --> 04:21:44,860
Ouch!

5602
04:21:45,360 --> 04:21:45,720
That's it.

5603
04:21:45,800 --> 04:21:46,800
This is it for me, guys!

5604
04:21:48,200 --> 04:21:50,740
Why are there so many babies?!

5605
04:21:50,740 --> 04:21:51,980
Oh my god!

5606
04:21:54,560 --> 04:21:56,000
There's so many babies!

5607
04:21:58,340 --> 04:22:00,600
I'm gonna go try to get to the other side.

5608
04:22:09,720 --> 04:22:11,400
That was less than ideal.

5609
04:22:13,880 --> 04:22:15,820
Try the... grenade launcher.

5610
04:22:15,940 --> 04:22:19,660
I was trying to save all my big boys for... the final fight.

5611
04:22:19,660 --> 04:22:21,960
Cause I don't know what kind of fight it is.

5612
04:22:22,460 --> 04:22:25,480
So I'm trying to save all my big stuff for...

5613
04:22:25,980 --> 04:22:28,440
I don't even have any... I don't have revolver bullets...

5614
04:22:28,440 --> 04:22:29,320
Oh wait, I got more!

5615
04:22:29,460 --> 04:22:30,200
When did that happen?

5616
04:22:31,460 --> 04:22:36,100
Mankey, mankey, mankey, mankey, mankey, mankey, mankey, mankey, mankey...

5617
04:22:36,100 --> 04:22:36,840
Sunset!

5618
04:22:37,020 --> 04:22:37,660
Thank you!

5619
04:22:38,340 --> 04:22:39,860
Thank you so much!

5620
04:22:40,860 --> 04:22:42,200
Happy, kinky, mankey.

5621
04:22:42,720 --> 04:22:45,160
It's slow and dumb, you should be good, they'll restock you.

5622
04:22:45,440 --> 04:22:47,820
Okay, okay, okay!

5623
04:22:48,340 --> 04:22:49,280
At least I say so.

5624
04:22:50,360 --> 04:22:51,700
I'm looking around real quick.

5625
04:22:57,770 --> 04:23:00,350
I think I got his ass for real this time.

5626
04:23:02,430 --> 04:23:03,830
I think I got that... oh.

5627
04:23:04,790 --> 04:23:06,190
Please, hold the door!

5628
04:23:07,010 --> 04:23:08,770
Would you hold the door for me?

5629
04:23:08,890 --> 04:23:10,310
Whoa, what is that up there?

5630
04:23:11,170 --> 04:23:14,350
This thing is... this thing is... woof.

5631
04:23:17,290 --> 04:23:17,770
Ouch!

5632
04:23:17,850 --> 04:23:18,930
I just got up here, please!

5633
04:23:22,470 --> 04:23:23,810
Okay, I'm running.

5634
04:23:26,270 --> 04:23:27,370
Uh-oh, they're coming?

5635
04:23:28,850 --> 04:23:29,330
Okay.

5636
04:23:29,690 --> 04:23:30,830
I'm back in the walls.

5637
04:23:32,550 --> 04:23:34,430
Oh, where the heck am I?

5638
04:23:35,590 --> 04:23:36,510
Oh my god.

5639
04:23:39,150 --> 04:23:41,070
Oh, this is literal hell.

5640
04:23:43,910 --> 04:23:44,430
Um...

5641
04:23:45,770 --> 04:23:48,490
Uh... I'm trying to see if I see any guys, but I don't.

5642
04:23:48,670 --> 04:23:49,430
I hear them.

5643
04:23:49,930 --> 04:23:50,770
Oh, there you are.

5644
04:23:52,250 --> 04:23:54,030
He's hoarding all the supplies!

5645
04:23:58,470 --> 04:23:59,070
Uh...

5646
04:23:59,070 --> 04:24:00,850
You gotta share...

5647
04:24:02,250 --> 04:24:02,850
Where?

5648
04:24:03,170 --> 04:24:03,690
Where?

5649
04:24:04,430 --> 04:24:05,490
Oh, there he is.

5650
04:24:09,570 --> 04:24:12,610
Yeah, good luck doing your job when you're dead.

5651
04:24:13,890 --> 04:24:14,490
Bozo.

5652
04:24:15,110 --> 04:24:17,490
Maybe I should have gone through the other one.

5653
04:24:18,470 --> 04:24:19,950
Is there anything down here?

5654
04:24:21,450 --> 04:24:22,950
Maybe I should have gone through...

5655
04:24:24,090 --> 04:24:24,870
Oh, wait.

5656
04:24:25,390 --> 04:24:26,330
It's a bunch of...

5657
04:24:26,330 --> 04:24:26,790
Oh, wait.

5658
04:24:26,890 --> 04:24:27,390
There's some health.

5659
04:24:27,730 --> 04:24:28,570
That's huge!

5660
04:24:29,030 --> 04:24:29,530
Let's go.

5661
04:24:31,990 --> 04:24:34,210
You've become my second Kamiyoshi.

5662
04:24:35,190 --> 04:24:36,070
Thank you.

5663
04:24:36,070 --> 04:24:36,250
Yeah.

5664
04:24:45,010 --> 04:24:45,350
Where?

5665
04:24:46,110 --> 04:24:47,630
This room is so scary because...

5666
04:24:50,990 --> 04:24:52,590
We're just gonna ignore the Hellcores?

5667
04:24:52,810 --> 04:24:53,430
Yeah, yeah.

5668
04:24:53,930 --> 04:24:54,270
Yeah.

5669
04:24:56,130 --> 04:24:56,470
Ain't...

5670
04:24:56,470 --> 04:24:57,450
Ain't no big deal.

5671
04:24:57,650 --> 04:25:00,230
Okay, let's go through the other one and then we'll be able to get the other stuff.

5672
04:25:01,410 --> 04:25:03,070
Dang, I thought this was the way out.

5673
04:25:03,230 --> 04:25:04,410
Or like the way we were supposed to go.

5674
04:25:06,430 --> 04:25:07,550
But clearly...

5675
04:25:08,350 --> 04:25:08,630
Not.

5676
04:25:09,990 --> 04:25:10,550
Alright.

5677
04:25:10,730 --> 04:25:11,870
All the babies are out here.

5678
04:25:14,990 --> 04:25:15,550
Nice.

5679
04:25:23,640 --> 04:25:25,060
Can't aim, little baby?

5680
04:25:25,720 --> 04:25:27,480
You don't have any functions yet?

5681
04:25:27,600 --> 04:25:28,460
Look, he's doing a jig.

5682
04:25:28,820 --> 04:25:29,620
He's dancing.

5683
04:25:35,100 --> 04:25:36,440
I have to go to the other side.

5684
04:25:37,600 --> 04:25:38,640
Why did the minky...

5685
04:25:39,340 --> 04:25:40,320
cross the road?

5686
04:25:44,200 --> 04:25:45,960
I heard another guy in here.

5687
04:25:48,780 --> 04:25:49,220
Somewhere.

5688
04:25:53,810 --> 04:25:55,690
I can't pick any of this up either?

5689
04:25:57,210 --> 04:25:57,730
Surely.

5690
04:25:58,930 --> 04:25:59,770
Surely game.

5691
04:26:00,510 --> 04:26:01,330
Surely game.

5692
04:26:01,530 --> 04:26:01,730
You...

5693
04:26:01,730 --> 04:26:03,510
You will give me some revolver ammo.

5694
04:26:03,790 --> 04:26:04,270
Surely.

5695
04:26:06,050 --> 04:26:06,570
Save.

5696
04:26:06,670 --> 04:26:07,190
Yeah, that's a good idea.

5697
04:26:08,210 --> 04:26:10,490
I keep making new saves because I'm not committed.

5698
04:26:11,070 --> 04:26:12,170
But I should be.

5699
04:26:12,490 --> 04:26:13,010
Because...

5700
04:26:13,010 --> 04:26:14,150
We've gotten this far already.

5701
04:26:16,090 --> 04:26:16,870
Oh my god.

5702
04:26:19,810 --> 04:26:20,630
Holy cow.

5703
04:26:20,630 --> 04:26:22,190
If I hadn't saved!

5704
04:26:22,690 --> 04:26:24,290
If I hadn't saved!

5705
04:26:24,490 --> 04:26:25,010
If I hadn't saved!

5706
04:26:25,010 --> 04:26:25,330
Holy cow.

5707
04:26:27,090 --> 04:26:28,530
Should be good to quicksave.

5708
04:26:28,730 --> 04:26:29,730
Probably at this point.

5709
04:26:32,870 --> 04:26:34,970
Probably at this point, it's good to...

5710
04:26:34,970 --> 04:26:36,010
I can quicksave.

5711
04:26:36,530 --> 04:26:37,090
But...

5712
04:26:37,390 --> 04:26:38,010
I don't know.

5713
04:26:38,290 --> 04:26:38,990
I'm not committed.

5714
04:26:41,170 --> 04:26:42,110
Anything else?

5715
04:26:42,330 --> 04:26:42,590
No?

5716
04:26:43,630 --> 04:26:44,290
What's up here?

5717
04:26:45,730 --> 04:26:46,290
None!

5718
04:26:46,670 --> 04:26:47,990
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

5719
04:26:48,190 --> 04:26:48,730
Thank you!

5720
04:26:52,610 --> 04:26:54,010
There's a hole there, Minky.

5721
04:26:54,390 --> 04:26:55,270
Wait, where's a hole?

5722
04:26:55,730 --> 04:26:56,550
Oh my gosh.

5723
04:26:58,190 --> 04:27:00,530
I had to be very careful about where I...

5724
04:27:00,530 --> 04:27:01,330
How I shot that.

5725
04:27:03,530 --> 04:27:04,430
My friend!

5726
04:27:06,330 --> 04:27:07,150
My friend!

5727
04:27:09,870 --> 04:27:11,610
Oh my gosh, where the hell did you come from?

5728
04:27:17,700 --> 04:27:19,140
We got two bullets left.

5729
04:27:23,150 --> 04:27:24,550
I will quicksave.

5730
04:27:26,210 --> 04:27:27,410
Did we get crossbow ammo?

5731
04:27:28,130 --> 04:27:29,270
No way.

5732
04:27:29,690 --> 04:27:29,990
Wait.

5733
04:27:32,150 --> 04:27:33,310
Only five.

5734
04:27:34,590 --> 04:27:35,690
Only five.

5735
04:27:44,130 --> 04:27:45,150
Save's coming.

5736
04:27:45,350 --> 04:27:45,730
Always.

5737
04:27:46,510 --> 04:27:47,030
Absolutely.

5738
04:27:49,450 --> 04:27:51,970
In games like these, I feel like it's encouraged.

5739
04:27:52,590 --> 04:27:54,290
I feel like it wouldn't be encouraged...

5740
04:27:54,710 --> 04:27:55,430
Oh my gosh.

5741
04:27:55,430 --> 04:27:56,270
Oh my god.

5742
04:27:57,670 --> 04:28:00,750
I feel like...

5743
04:28:01,490 --> 04:28:03,530
Aw man, all my armor.

5744
04:28:04,070 --> 04:28:10,190
I feel like a game, if they do quick saves and quick loads, that's encouraging saves coming.

5745
04:28:11,190 --> 04:28:13,250
That's my philosophy.

5746
04:28:30,310 --> 04:28:31,650
We gotta go up.

5747
04:28:34,630 --> 04:28:35,310
No!

5748
04:28:35,690 --> 04:28:36,510
Leave me alone!

5749
04:28:36,510 --> 04:28:36,630
Come on!

5750
04:28:40,890 --> 04:28:42,090
Oh, are you kidding me?

5751
04:28:42,970 --> 04:28:43,590
Never mind.

5752
04:28:43,730 --> 04:28:44,590
We did need to go up.

5753
04:28:45,710 --> 04:28:46,110
Uh...

5754
04:28:46,110 --> 04:28:46,430
Wait.

5755
04:28:47,390 --> 04:28:48,390
Is there another...

5756
04:28:48,390 --> 04:28:49,730
Oh, there's even more up.

5757
04:28:49,850 --> 04:28:51,410
Okay, we gotta go up, up, up.

5758
04:29:01,130 --> 04:29:03,010
Oh my god, there's so many babies again!

5759
04:29:04,030 --> 04:29:04,430
No!

5760
04:29:04,430 --> 04:29:04,510
No!

5761
04:29:06,510 --> 04:29:07,230
Oh god!

5762
04:29:15,690 --> 04:29:16,690
Okay, okay, okay.

5763
04:29:17,130 --> 04:29:17,590
You know what?

5764
04:29:17,710 --> 04:29:18,030
Screw it.

5765
04:29:19,710 --> 04:29:20,990
You can ignore most of them.

5766
04:29:21,130 --> 04:29:22,010
Yeah, I'm going to try.

5767
04:29:26,710 --> 04:29:27,810
Up, up, and away!

5768
04:29:27,810 --> 04:29:27,970
Me!

5769
04:29:35,330 --> 04:29:37,150
Oh, we made it!

5770
04:29:43,450 --> 04:29:45,330
I am the last.

5771
04:29:45,790 --> 04:29:48,290
Last, I am the last.

5772
04:29:54,930 --> 04:29:56,210
This time?

5773
04:30:08,020 --> 04:30:10,480
Mates don't get tired, they get sleepy.

5774
04:30:12,400 --> 04:30:12,920
Sweepy.

5775
04:30:12,920 --> 04:30:13,040
Sweepy.

5776
04:30:18,330 --> 04:30:19,550
I don't know where to go.

5777
04:30:21,010 --> 04:30:21,530
Hello.

5778
04:30:24,830 --> 04:30:25,890
Is this it?

5779
04:30:26,390 --> 04:30:27,370
This is it?

5780
04:30:27,930 --> 04:30:29,150
This is the boss!

5781
04:30:29,530 --> 04:30:30,770
The final boss!

5782
04:30:35,060 --> 04:30:36,320
Get the big boy out.

5783
04:30:47,350 --> 04:30:49,110
Oh, it did let me quicksave.

5784
04:30:49,210 --> 04:30:50,890
I thought it didn't let me quicksave for a second.

5785
04:30:50,890 --> 04:30:51,630
Alright.

5786
04:30:52,150 --> 04:30:52,450
Let's go!

5787
04:30:55,890 --> 04:30:57,330
Wait, what did I just...

5788
04:30:57,330 --> 04:30:58,590
I just heard someone speak.

5789
04:31:00,730 --> 04:31:01,490
Oh.

5790
04:31:04,910 --> 04:31:07,050
Oh my god, it's a big baby!

5791
04:31:07,630 --> 04:31:08,290
Oh no!

5792
04:31:09,050 --> 04:31:09,810
Oh no!

5793
04:31:11,790 --> 04:31:12,590
Oh no!

5794
04:31:14,050 --> 04:31:18,470
Giant baby!

5795
04:31:18,470 --> 04:31:20,950
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5796
04:31:20,950 --> 04:31:21,870
Ha ha ha ha ha!

5797
04:31:23,810 --> 04:31:24,850
You're spinning!

5798
04:31:27,310 --> 04:31:27,930
Um...

5799
04:31:30,120 --> 04:31:30,600
Right.

5800
04:31:31,980 --> 04:31:32,600
Oh.

5801
04:31:35,890 --> 04:31:36,820
What is that thing?

5802
04:31:40,360 --> 04:31:41,820
Do I need to destroy that?

5803
04:31:42,890 --> 04:31:44,040
Shoot the crystal, yeah.

5804
04:31:44,910 --> 04:31:46,440
I discovered that afterwards.

5805
04:31:47,840 --> 04:31:49,560
It's like the ender dragon.

5806
04:31:50,080 --> 04:31:50,740
Ha ha ha ha ha!

5807
04:31:52,660 --> 04:31:53,040
Oh!

5808
04:31:55,320 --> 04:31:56,100
Woo!

5809
04:32:00,000 --> 04:32:00,780
Ugh.

5810
04:32:01,600 --> 04:32:01,880
Ugh.

5811
04:32:02,240 --> 04:32:03,000
Please.

5812
04:32:03,760 --> 04:32:04,320
Oh gosh.

5813
04:32:04,560 --> 04:32:04,740
Okay.

5814
04:32:06,660 --> 04:32:07,440
Uh...

5815
04:32:07,440 --> 04:32:07,780
Oh.

5816
04:32:11,440 --> 04:32:12,220
Oh.

5817
04:32:13,040 --> 04:32:13,420
No.

5818
04:32:13,880 --> 04:32:14,280
No.

5819
04:32:14,720 --> 04:32:15,660
Oh no.

5820
04:32:16,120 --> 04:32:16,860
I'm just gonna reload.

5821
04:32:16,860 --> 04:32:17,680
Okay.

5822
04:32:17,900 --> 04:32:18,180
Anyway.

5823
04:32:19,280 --> 04:32:20,060
Ha ha ha ha ha.

5824
04:32:20,580 --> 04:32:21,540
Let's just, uh...

5825
04:32:21,540 --> 04:32:22,240
Let's try that again.

5826
04:32:26,440 --> 04:32:27,520
And then...

5827
04:32:29,000 --> 04:32:30,200
Like, you hear it?

5828
04:32:31,100 --> 04:32:32,600
I hear someone speaking.

5829
04:32:36,140 --> 04:32:37,180
Oh, it's...

5830
04:32:37,180 --> 04:32:37,820
Oh, the scientists!

5831
04:32:38,120 --> 04:32:39,380
They're like, thank god you're here!

5832
04:32:39,940 --> 04:32:41,220
Oh my god!

5833
04:32:41,840 --> 04:32:43,080
It's the scientists!

5834
04:32:45,360 --> 04:32:46,000
Whoa!

5835
04:32:46,580 --> 04:32:47,560
That's cool!

5836
04:32:52,360 --> 04:32:54,540
The roomie teleports you to have his arm...

5837
04:32:54,540 --> 04:32:55,360
Ammo and...

5838
04:32:56,360 --> 04:32:57,000
Oh.

5839
04:33:03,870 --> 04:33:04,510
Wait!

5840
04:33:04,650 --> 04:33:05,110
Oh, there we go.

5841
04:33:05,310 --> 04:33:05,690
That's...

5842
04:33:05,690 --> 04:33:06,190
That was weird.

5843
04:33:08,610 --> 04:33:09,690
You know what I mean?

5844
04:33:13,910 --> 04:33:14,410
Run!

5845
04:33:15,310 --> 04:33:16,690
I don't wanna get teleported!

5846
04:33:45,250 --> 04:33:46,650
Okay.

5847
04:33:46,650 --> 04:33:48,290
Please, little baby.

5848
04:33:48,750 --> 04:33:49,670
Oh my gosh.

5849
04:33:51,150 --> 04:33:51,730
Ow!

5850
04:33:54,070 --> 04:33:55,690
Is it just you, little baby?

5851
04:33:57,150 --> 04:33:58,070
Where are you?

5852
04:33:58,230 --> 04:33:58,730
Where'd you go?

5853
04:33:59,050 --> 04:34:00,350
Oh, you're so small.

5854
04:34:00,950 --> 04:34:02,030
You're just a baby.

5855
04:34:02,890 --> 04:34:03,510
Oh my gosh.

5856
04:34:04,390 --> 04:34:05,570
I think I killed him.

5857
04:34:07,830 --> 04:34:10,450
Please, let me onto the platform.

5858
04:34:11,810 --> 04:34:12,190
Okay.

5859
04:34:13,850 --> 04:34:15,430
Is another guy coming in?

5860
04:34:18,950 --> 04:34:19,670
Okay.

5861
04:34:19,670 --> 04:34:20,390
Okay.

5862
04:34:21,810 --> 04:34:21,950
Okay.

5863
04:34:26,210 --> 04:34:26,930
Nice.

5864
04:34:33,310 --> 04:34:36,130
Oh, what are those?

5865
04:34:37,350 --> 04:34:38,370
What is that?

5866
04:34:38,470 --> 04:34:39,030
Is that a baby?

5867
04:34:47,320 --> 04:34:48,380
They're babies.

5868
04:34:48,380 --> 04:34:48,500
Please.

5869
04:34:54,150 --> 04:34:55,110
I'm reloading.

5870
04:35:01,810 --> 04:35:03,310
It's like the Titanic movie.

5871
04:35:07,070 --> 04:35:08,630
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5872
04:35:12,110 --> 04:35:13,330
It's a matter, baby.

5873
04:35:13,790 --> 04:35:14,690
What's the matter, baby?

5874
04:35:14,690 --> 04:35:14,750
Okay.

5875
04:35:16,510 --> 04:35:17,310
Everything's a matter.

5876
04:35:19,190 --> 04:35:20,030
Everything's a matter.

5877
04:35:20,710 --> 04:35:24,350
Including platforming in your, in the final boss fight.

5878
04:35:24,510 --> 04:35:26,870
And it's, I'm not even fighting the boss right now.

5879
04:35:27,010 --> 04:35:29,730
I'm just, I'm fighting his kids.

5880
04:35:30,530 --> 04:35:31,710
Which are also baby.

5881
04:35:31,850 --> 04:35:32,530
He's a baby.

5882
04:35:32,790 --> 04:35:33,690
His kids are babies.

5883
04:35:35,370 --> 04:35:36,410
Everything's a baby.

5884
04:35:37,250 --> 04:35:37,250
Everything's a baby.

5885
04:35:37,250 --> 04:35:37,750
I don't know which one.

5886
04:35:37,830 --> 04:35:41,090
Everything looks the same too, so I can't tell where I need to go.

5887
04:35:45,190 --> 04:35:46,730
Everything looks the same.

5888
04:35:48,630 --> 04:35:49,630
We're babies.

5889
04:35:52,510 --> 04:35:57,030
Like, can I just like, I can't tell what is a platform.

5890
04:35:57,650 --> 04:35:58,250
Sometimes.

5891
04:35:58,930 --> 04:36:00,870
I think that's...

5892
04:36:00,870 --> 04:36:01,910
I can't tell.

5893
04:36:02,710 --> 04:36:04,390
These textures are horrible!

5894
04:36:05,850 --> 04:36:07,150
Jump to the left.

5895
04:36:07,430 --> 04:36:07,950
This one?

5896
04:36:12,300 --> 04:36:12,900
This?

5897
04:36:13,140 --> 04:36:13,280
Okay.

5898
04:36:14,460 --> 04:36:15,940
There is more...

5899
04:36:16,580 --> 04:36:17,240
Stuff here.

5900
04:36:17,400 --> 04:36:18,060
Oh, there's a baby.

5901
04:36:18,780 --> 04:36:19,700
Killed that guy.

5902
04:36:21,460 --> 04:36:22,920
Alright, um...

5903
04:36:23,680 --> 04:36:26,380
I feel like I'm in Junji Ito world right now.

5904
04:36:26,500 --> 04:36:26,920
For real.

5905
04:36:27,920 --> 04:36:28,700
Oh, no, please.

5906
04:36:28,920 --> 04:36:29,720
Oh, god, thank you.

5907
04:36:33,180 --> 04:36:34,520
Attack of the trypophobia.

5908
04:36:34,820 --> 04:36:35,000
Right!

5909
04:36:38,830 --> 04:36:39,990
No, no, no, no!

5910
04:36:43,330 --> 04:36:43,690
Okay.

5911
04:36:45,190 --> 04:36:45,810
Quick save?

5912
04:36:46,710 --> 04:36:47,410
So true.

5913
04:36:47,590 --> 04:36:48,450
You guys are so smart.

5914
04:36:49,450 --> 04:36:50,570
You guys are so smart.

5915
04:36:50,710 --> 04:36:51,090
Thank you.

5916
04:36:51,330 --> 04:36:52,230
I didn't think about it.

5917
04:36:52,370 --> 04:36:54,590
I didn't think you could quick save in a boss fight.

5918
04:36:56,570 --> 04:36:57,630
Save often here.

5919
04:36:57,630 --> 04:36:58,410
I didn't even...

5920
04:36:58,410 --> 04:36:59,790
That didn't even occur to me!

5921
04:37:05,080 --> 04:37:07,180
Note the broken shackles on the...

5922
04:37:07,180 --> 04:37:08,080
On the wrists.

5923
04:37:08,340 --> 04:37:09,180
Not a strategy hint.

5924
04:37:09,680 --> 04:37:11,000
Just implied lore.

5925
04:37:11,540 --> 04:37:11,760
Mmm.

5926
04:37:20,190 --> 04:37:20,510
Mmm.

5927
04:37:21,630 --> 04:37:23,310
Why am I so bad at jumping less?

5928
04:37:23,630 --> 04:37:24,630
You can do it.

5929
04:37:25,230 --> 04:37:25,790
Normal?

5930
04:37:27,010 --> 04:37:28,150
I don't think so.

5931
04:37:30,750 --> 04:37:32,070
I'm so bad at this.

5932
04:37:33,110 --> 04:37:35,130
Stand right next to it and jump up.

5933
04:37:37,350 --> 04:37:37,750
Oh.

5934
04:37:38,310 --> 04:37:38,710
Oh.

5935
04:37:44,540 --> 04:37:45,340
Oh, I see.

5936
04:37:46,660 --> 04:37:47,460
Oh, I see.

5937
04:37:51,190 --> 04:37:51,590
Octopath.

5938
04:37:51,830 --> 04:37:52,250
Wait, sorry.

5939
04:37:52,350 --> 04:37:53,610
I can't read your super turbo now.

5940
04:37:53,630 --> 04:37:54,470
I went so fast!

5941
04:37:54,750 --> 04:37:54,890
Oh!

5942
04:37:55,050 --> 04:37:55,790
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

5943
04:37:56,610 --> 04:37:57,390
But thank you!

5944
04:37:57,570 --> 04:37:58,010
Oh, my god.

5945
04:38:02,320 --> 04:38:03,400
Leave me alone.

5946
04:38:04,260 --> 04:38:05,660
I don't want to talk to you.

5947
04:38:05,940 --> 04:38:07,300
What is this thing right here?

5948
04:38:08,120 --> 04:38:09,700
What am I picking up that...

5949
04:38:09,700 --> 04:38:10,360
That thing?

5950
04:38:10,360 --> 04:38:12,000
I can't tell what it does.

5951
04:38:17,510 --> 04:38:18,090
Oh.

5952
04:38:19,150 --> 04:38:20,330
Good thing I said it.

5953
04:38:21,430 --> 04:38:22,210
Ammo serv...

5954
04:38:22,210 --> 04:38:23,450
Oh, it's a random ammo.

5955
04:38:23,770 --> 04:38:24,590
Oh, okay.

5956
04:38:28,580 --> 04:38:28,940
Oh.

5957
04:38:33,960 --> 04:38:35,400
Almost there.

5958
04:38:35,740 --> 04:38:37,260
Isn't this so great, guys?

5959
04:38:37,720 --> 04:38:38,660
Almost there!

5960
04:38:53,660 --> 04:38:54,580
Oh.

5961
04:38:54,580 --> 04:38:56,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

5962
04:39:03,620 --> 04:39:08,960
Gordon Freeman is so... this guy is so... fast.

5963
04:39:10,940 --> 04:39:12,020
Booty shot.

5964
04:39:12,300 --> 04:39:13,000
Booty shot.

5965
04:39:18,990 --> 04:39:21,410
Oh, I forgot to save once I got up there.

5966
04:39:22,350 --> 04:39:22,610
Okay.

5967
04:39:23,170 --> 04:39:23,650
Save.

5968
04:39:23,870 --> 04:39:24,370
Okay, cool.

5969
04:39:27,640 --> 04:39:29,740
Oh, I should have changed my weapon.

5970
04:39:30,320 --> 04:39:32,000
Oh, no, now the babies are here?

5971
04:39:34,300 --> 04:39:35,260
Say it ain't so.

5972
04:39:36,040 --> 04:39:36,380
What the?

5973
04:39:37,320 --> 04:39:37,600
Okay.

5974
04:39:46,790 --> 04:39:47,250
Oh.

5975
04:39:47,250 --> 04:39:48,270
What the hell is this?

5976
04:39:49,190 --> 04:39:49,890
What am I?

5977
04:39:50,090 --> 04:39:50,710
Where am I?

5978
04:39:51,190 --> 04:39:51,970
What is going on?

5979
04:40:07,400 --> 04:40:07,940
The truth.

5980
04:40:08,240 --> 04:40:09,700
You can never know.

5981
04:40:10,260 --> 04:40:11,220
There's so many babies.

5982
04:40:12,920 --> 04:40:16,060
What do I... What do I kill?

5983
04:40:16,240 --> 04:40:16,900
The babies?

5984
04:40:19,840 --> 04:40:20,720
One baby.

5985
04:40:26,670 --> 04:40:27,710
Oh, I'm out.

5986
04:40:28,090 --> 04:40:28,950
Reload, please.

5987
04:40:32,410 --> 04:40:33,250
Oh, my God.

5988
04:40:33,430 --> 04:40:34,270
You're on the ground.

5989
04:40:34,650 --> 04:40:35,250
Get up.

5990
04:40:35,450 --> 04:40:36,050
You lazy.

5991
04:40:38,090 --> 04:40:46,050
How do I... Oh, I have to platform, like, these little bubbles?

5992
04:40:46,410 --> 04:40:47,190
Are you kidding me?

5993
04:40:48,790 --> 04:40:49,610
Please reload.

5994
04:40:51,210 --> 04:40:52,530
This is the worst room.

5995
04:40:55,230 --> 04:40:55,690
SMG?

5996
04:40:56,470 --> 04:40:59,430
Do I just... just... just... take them out?

5997
04:40:59,670 --> 04:41:00,170
Like that?

5998
04:41:05,100 --> 04:41:05,880
Oh, my gosh.

5999
04:41:06,000 --> 04:41:06,580
I'm, like, stuck.

6000
04:41:06,800 --> 04:41:07,800
I'm... I'm actually stuck.

6001
04:41:07,940 --> 04:41:08,500
Okay, there we go.

6002
04:41:13,360 --> 04:41:14,980
I lost, like, everything.

6003
04:41:15,340 --> 04:41:17,640
Wait, do I have to platform these bubbles?

6004
04:41:35,850 --> 04:41:36,450
Oh.

6005
04:41:36,910 --> 04:41:38,190
Oh, it's not platforming, really.

6006
04:42:00,500 --> 04:42:01,020
Ah!

6007
04:42:01,400 --> 04:42:02,560
It didn't even touch me!

6008
04:42:03,300 --> 04:42:04,180
Uh-oh.

6009
04:42:10,100 --> 04:42:11,140
Oh, my gosh.

6010
04:42:12,160 --> 04:42:13,380
Wait, what's in here?

6011
04:42:16,960 --> 04:42:17,520
Um...

6012
04:42:18,900 --> 04:42:19,180
Uh...

6013
04:42:20,480 --> 04:42:21,360
Booty shot!

6014
04:42:21,520 --> 04:42:22,040
Booty shot!

6015
04:42:28,780 --> 04:42:29,680
Oh, my gosh.

6016
04:42:29,960 --> 04:42:30,200
Eugh!

6017
04:42:47,670 --> 04:42:49,510
He will deceive you.

6018
04:42:57,290 --> 04:42:59,130
Ugh, I took so much damage there.

6019
04:42:59,610 --> 04:43:00,290
Oh, my God.

6020
04:43:00,370 --> 04:43:00,770
This guy's...

6021
04:43:02,430 --> 04:43:03,650
Oh, my gosh!

6022
04:43:04,810 --> 04:43:07,110
Take cover if you don't want to be teleported.

6023
04:43:07,270 --> 04:43:08,230
Is that how that works?

6024
04:43:09,930 --> 04:43:10,830
Like this?

6025
04:43:13,570 --> 04:43:14,210
Oh.

6026
04:43:15,730 --> 04:43:16,750
Oh, my God.

6027
04:43:17,330 --> 04:43:18,270
Holy cow!

6028
04:43:18,910 --> 04:43:19,470
About to die.

6029
04:43:21,790 --> 04:43:25,410
I think I got rid of all the crystals.

6030
04:43:25,410 --> 04:43:27,390
Using dead energy.

6031
04:43:28,130 --> 04:43:28,950
I think?

6032
04:43:32,970 --> 04:43:33,570
Oh.

6033
04:43:47,610 --> 04:43:48,130
Oh, my God.

6034
04:43:48,630 --> 04:43:49,450
That's awkward.

6035
04:43:50,170 --> 04:43:50,430
Boop!

6036
04:43:54,890 --> 04:43:55,590
I can't tell.

6037
04:43:58,790 --> 04:44:00,290
He has a weak spot.

6038
04:44:01,830 --> 04:44:02,370
Ouch!

6039
04:44:02,990 --> 04:44:04,210
It's, uh...

6040
04:44:04,210 --> 04:44:06,690
Uh, I go up through these, right?

6041
04:44:06,690 --> 04:44:09,090
Yeah, because, like, see, there's, like, glowing light over there.

6042
04:44:09,230 --> 04:44:09,990
I'm trying to figure out.

6043
04:44:11,890 --> 04:44:12,250
Oh.

6044
04:44:12,470 --> 04:44:13,330
I'm just in here.

6045
04:44:15,790 --> 04:44:16,150
Okay.

6046
04:44:16,350 --> 04:44:16,750
Wrong one.

6047
04:44:19,870 --> 04:44:20,510
Oh, my God.

6048
04:44:20,690 --> 04:44:21,630
It didn't go up high enough.

6049
04:44:21,870 --> 04:44:22,050
Ah!

6050
04:44:26,610 --> 04:44:26,970
Okay.

6051
04:44:28,370 --> 04:44:28,730
Okay.

6052
04:44:32,980 --> 04:44:34,580
This weak spot is made.

6053
04:44:35,000 --> 04:44:38,280
I wish... I wish the battle would be over then.

6054
04:44:54,460 --> 04:44:55,740
You spooked me.

6055
04:45:03,280 --> 04:45:03,880
Okay.

6056
04:45:06,280 --> 04:45:08,800
I'm hoping to get some health and stuff in here.

6057
04:45:11,980 --> 04:45:13,620
Uh... somewhere, maybe.

6058
04:45:16,340 --> 04:45:17,660
We barely... oh, wait, wait, wait.

6059
04:45:19,160 --> 04:45:20,220
There is stuff in here.

6060
04:45:27,570 --> 04:45:28,890
There's the fishy monster!

6061
04:45:30,430 --> 04:45:32,010
Oh, oh, oh, oh god.

6062
04:45:32,410 --> 04:45:34,690
It puts me in, like, such an awkward position.

6063
04:45:40,190 --> 04:45:40,870
Ouchy, ouch!

6064
04:45:44,170 --> 04:45:45,850
Oh my god, where did you show up?

6065
04:45:48,650 --> 04:45:50,010
Where the hell did you come from?

6066
04:45:52,030 --> 04:45:52,910
Oh my god.

6067
04:45:53,130 --> 04:45:53,910
Oh my god.

6068
04:46:03,220 --> 04:46:03,620
Oh my god.

6069
04:46:05,940 --> 04:46:06,340
Oh...

6070
04:46:07,160 --> 04:46:07,560
Okay.

6071
04:46:07,820 --> 04:46:09,600
I'm gonna try and get to the top of the head.

6072
04:46:12,480 --> 04:46:14,060
Let me see if I can...

6073
04:46:16,240 --> 04:46:16,980
From here.

6074
04:46:20,280 --> 04:46:21,380
Oh no, no, no!

6075
04:46:21,980 --> 04:46:22,780
It's not tall enough!

6076
04:46:23,840 --> 04:46:24,240
Oh...

6077
04:46:30,830 --> 04:46:31,230
Maybe...

6078
04:46:31,230 --> 04:46:31,730
Oh my gosh.

6079
04:46:31,890 --> 04:46:32,430
No, no, no!

6080
04:46:32,590 --> 04:46:32,770
Oh!

6081
04:46:33,010 --> 04:46:33,530
No, please!

6082
04:46:41,560 --> 04:46:43,360
I'm not jumping on top of it!

6083
04:46:44,580 --> 04:46:44,940
Oh...

6084
04:46:46,540 --> 04:46:47,360
Oh, it does...

6085
04:46:47,360 --> 04:46:48,980
I see what random stuff it gives you.

6086
04:46:49,060 --> 04:46:50,060
Oh, that's pretty nice, actually.

6087
04:46:50,240 --> 04:46:50,820
Oh, there he is.

6088
04:46:53,420 --> 04:46:54,860
These areas are so pain.

6089
04:46:55,180 --> 04:46:55,760
Oh my god.

6090
04:46:57,300 --> 04:47:02,280
It doesn't help that it, like, kind of puts me in a bad area when I, um...

6091
04:47:02,280 --> 04:47:02,820
load in.

6092
04:47:03,080 --> 04:47:04,480
In fact, I'll just save right here.

6093
04:47:04,480 --> 04:47:04,860
Okay.

6094
04:47:06,400 --> 04:47:07,120
This is better.

6095
04:47:07,320 --> 04:47:07,920
This is a better save.

6096
04:47:08,200 --> 04:47:09,460
Than being out in the open.

6097
04:47:10,380 --> 04:47:10,780
Okay.

6098
04:47:12,660 --> 04:47:13,060
Um...

6099
04:47:13,060 --> 04:47:13,540
Alright.

6100
04:47:15,640 --> 04:47:16,440
Let's see...

6101
04:47:16,440 --> 04:47:17,360
Let's go this way.

6102
04:47:19,640 --> 04:47:20,180
Hang on!

6103
04:47:26,030 --> 04:47:26,730
No, no, no!

6104
04:47:27,570 --> 04:47:30,650
Wait, maybe I can make it!

6105
04:47:30,830 --> 04:47:31,670
Maybe I can make it!

6106
04:47:31,870 --> 04:47:32,810
Maybe I can make it!

6107
04:47:32,930 --> 04:47:33,490
Oh my god!

6108
04:47:33,690 --> 04:47:34,330
Oh my god!

6109
04:47:34,470 --> 04:47:35,270
I made it!

6110
04:47:37,070 --> 04:47:38,210
Where he gets higher?

6111
04:47:54,150 --> 04:47:56,070
I didn't think he would still get me, but...

6112
04:47:56,570 --> 04:47:56,910
Boink!

6113
04:47:59,790 --> 04:48:02,390
I can hide behind the pillar when he shoots the thing.

6114
04:48:03,170 --> 04:48:03,290
Okay.

6115
04:48:03,770 --> 04:48:04,950
Go, go, go!

6116
04:48:05,970 --> 04:48:07,310
Into the health pool!

6117
04:48:07,890 --> 04:48:08,950
Alright, alright, alright.

6118
04:48:09,870 --> 04:48:10,390
Um...

6119
04:48:10,390 --> 04:48:11,250
Hide behind the pillar?

6120
04:48:11,450 --> 04:48:11,730
No!

6121
04:48:15,870 --> 04:48:16,390
No!

6122
04:48:16,830 --> 04:48:17,310
Please!

6123
04:48:17,310 --> 04:48:17,470
Please!

6124
04:48:17,810 --> 04:48:18,090
Hahaha!

6125
04:48:20,090 --> 04:48:20,630
Okay, okay.

6126
04:48:28,500 --> 04:48:29,340
I had it too.

6127
04:48:29,480 --> 04:48:30,240
I know I did!

6128
04:48:31,200 --> 04:48:32,220
I know I did!

6129
04:48:33,600 --> 04:48:35,060
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

6130
04:48:36,480 --> 04:48:37,140
Go, go, go!

6131
04:48:37,240 --> 04:48:38,900
Down, go, down, go, down, go, down, go, down.

6132
04:48:38,900 --> 04:48:40,520
I'm gonna...

6133
04:48:41,220 --> 04:48:43,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6134
04:48:43,100 --> 04:48:43,460
Oh, gosh.

6135
04:48:44,340 --> 04:48:44,980
Please don't.

6136
04:48:45,100 --> 04:48:45,400
Please.

6137
04:48:45,660 --> 04:48:46,440
Mr. Please.

6138
04:48:46,800 --> 04:48:47,940
Please, Mr. Please.

6139
04:48:48,360 --> 04:48:48,600
No!

6140
04:49:00,750 --> 04:49:02,210
I'm doing my best over here.

6141
04:49:05,660 --> 04:49:06,360
And... whoop!

6142
04:49:08,100 --> 04:49:09,840
Uh-oh, I think that's the teleporter.

6143
04:49:10,680 --> 04:49:12,000
Yes, indeed it is.

6144
04:49:12,220 --> 04:49:12,640
Please.

6145
04:49:13,000 --> 04:49:13,980
No, you don't see me.

6146
04:49:19,670 --> 04:49:20,150
Redo.

6147
04:49:26,310 --> 04:49:27,590
We're gonna get this perfect.

6148
04:49:31,680 --> 04:49:32,160
Okay.

6149
04:49:45,170 --> 04:49:46,510
Okay, save.

6150
04:49:46,830 --> 04:49:47,910
Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

6151
04:49:50,850 --> 04:49:51,330
Okay!

6152
04:49:51,690 --> 04:49:53,210
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

6153
04:49:53,430 --> 04:49:54,590
I just don't... wait.

6154
04:49:54,910 --> 04:49:56,710
I just don't know how to get from...

6155
04:49:57,730 --> 04:49:58,210
What?!

6156
04:50:02,150 --> 04:50:04,370
I just don't know how to get from...

6157
04:50:08,680 --> 04:50:10,660
From here, all the way over...

6158
04:50:10,660 --> 04:50:12,200
Do you see any other platforms?

6159
04:50:22,810 --> 04:50:23,690
Okay, sit...

6160
04:50:23,690 --> 04:50:24,890
I'm sitting in here?

6161
04:50:25,090 --> 04:50:25,270
Oh.

6162
04:50:25,750 --> 04:50:26,470
Hello, mister.

6163
04:50:28,910 --> 04:50:30,570
I'm sniping you with my...

6164
04:50:30,570 --> 04:50:31,070
Ouchie!

6165
04:50:35,270 --> 04:50:36,250
Oh, golly.

6166
04:50:36,410 --> 04:50:36,790
Oh, golly.

6167
04:50:36,790 --> 04:50:36,890
Wait.

6168
04:50:46,800 --> 04:50:49,400
Someone said I can shoot the portals...

6169
04:50:49,400 --> 04:50:50,420
To get rid of them.

6170
04:50:50,680 --> 04:50:51,240
Let's try it.

6171
04:50:52,160 --> 04:50:52,680
Oh, god.

6172
04:50:54,220 --> 04:50:54,660
Okay.

6173
04:50:55,720 --> 04:50:56,580
Okay, this is...

6174
04:50:56,580 --> 04:50:57,260
Here, I'm gonna try.

6175
04:51:00,640 --> 04:51:01,080
Oh.

6176
04:51:01,900 --> 04:51:03,900
I don't know if that was this, or...

6177
04:51:06,380 --> 04:51:06,820
Oh!

6178
04:51:07,060 --> 04:51:07,680
It does work.

6179
04:51:07,940 --> 04:51:08,880
It does work.

6180
04:51:08,880 --> 04:51:10,100
Okay, okay.

6181
04:51:10,140 --> 04:51:10,560
Let's see.

6182
04:51:11,040 --> 04:51:11,920
Gonna bees them?

6183
04:51:14,400 --> 04:51:14,960
Bees!

6184
04:51:18,420 --> 04:51:19,980
This is not a good spot.

6185
04:51:24,260 --> 04:51:26,720
But I don't know how I can...

6186
04:51:26,720 --> 04:51:29,680
Get all the way to the other side from this...

6187
04:51:29,680 --> 04:51:30,500
From the jump.

6188
04:51:40,580 --> 04:51:41,140
Mmm...

6189
04:51:41,140 --> 04:51:43,400
Gotta jump to the left using the pad.

6190
04:51:45,300 --> 04:51:46,340
Oh, god.

6191
04:51:47,580 --> 04:51:49,200
You don't have to get to the other side.

6192
04:51:49,520 --> 04:51:50,120
I don't.

6193
04:51:54,500 --> 04:51:56,800
Oh, I don't know, actually, if it's the portal or not.

6194
04:52:04,120 --> 04:52:05,260
No, no, no, no!

6195
04:52:06,540 --> 04:52:09,600
I was pressing left like my life depended on it.

6196
04:52:09,820 --> 04:52:10,700
Which it... which it did.

6197
04:52:11,080 --> 04:52:11,860
But, um...

6198
04:52:15,280 --> 04:52:16,860
Okay, I'm just gonna go back to...

6199
04:52:18,120 --> 04:52:18,840
Throwing grenades.

6200
04:52:20,200 --> 04:52:21,000
Oh, no, see?

6201
04:52:21,400 --> 04:52:22,860
It doesn't always...

6202
04:52:25,260 --> 04:52:26,760
I really don't like this room.

6203
04:52:26,900 --> 04:52:28,140
I really don't like this room.

6204
04:52:28,360 --> 04:52:28,740
I really...

6205
04:52:28,740 --> 04:52:29,920
I wasn't ready for this room!

6206
04:52:29,940 --> 04:52:31,340
I really don't like this room!

6207
04:52:31,940 --> 04:52:33,740
Don't make me come into here, please!

6208
04:52:34,060 --> 04:52:34,640
Oh, my god.

6209
04:52:34,880 --> 04:52:36,120
Don't make me be in the water.

6210
04:52:36,280 --> 04:52:37,420
Don't make me fight the guys.

6211
04:52:37,900 --> 04:52:38,260
Please!

6212
04:52:40,620 --> 04:52:42,980
This is my least favorite of the room so far!

6213
04:52:43,760 --> 04:52:45,020
Because it's so dark.

6214
04:52:45,940 --> 04:52:47,660
And I don't like the electric guys.

6215
04:52:48,480 --> 04:52:50,020
I'm just gonna turn my lights on.

6216
04:52:51,880 --> 04:52:53,880
Oh, I shot your dead friend!

6217
04:52:55,040 --> 04:52:56,720
Okay, don't go into the water.

6218
04:52:57,240 --> 04:52:58,720
The water's not worth it.

6219
04:53:03,460 --> 04:53:05,640
Something else just spawned, I think.

6220
04:53:07,740 --> 04:53:08,600
Ouch!

6221
04:53:08,980 --> 04:53:09,260
Ouch!

6222
04:53:11,640 --> 04:53:12,500
Ugh!

6223
04:53:14,220 --> 04:53:15,740
Sippy the water!

6224
04:53:17,420 --> 04:53:19,060
I'm struggling here.

6225
04:53:28,410 --> 04:53:31,330
I'll save once we get full health and the armor.

6226
04:53:35,090 --> 04:53:35,890
Deep breath.

6227
04:53:38,410 --> 04:53:39,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6228
04:53:39,550 --> 04:53:41,210
I think it's just because I'm...

6229
04:53:41,210 --> 04:53:44,370
I was focused on people telling me to get on his head or something.

6230
04:53:44,770 --> 04:53:47,090
But I think I'm just gonna shoot at him.

6231
04:53:48,330 --> 04:53:49,810
I think I'm just gonna shoot at him.

6232
04:53:56,350 --> 04:53:57,810
No, you don't need to go up yet.

6233
04:53:57,990 --> 04:53:58,470
Oh, see.

6234
04:53:59,870 --> 04:54:01,570
That's where I was making the mistakes.

6235
04:54:03,030 --> 04:54:05,110
I think people just get so...

6236
04:54:05,990 --> 04:54:06,670
What's the word?

6237
04:54:07,570 --> 04:54:09,070
They get so excited.

6238
04:54:09,250 --> 04:54:12,530
Like, you know, they're like, Oh, you need to get up there so you can take it out!

6239
04:54:12,710 --> 04:54:13,270
But it's...

6240
04:54:13,270 --> 04:54:16,450
But it's not the case just yet, you know?

6241
04:54:16,990 --> 04:54:19,990
People get a little too excited and tell me info too quickly.

6242
04:54:22,650 --> 04:54:23,950
Yeah, a little worked up.

6243
04:54:24,090 --> 04:54:24,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6244
04:54:24,590 --> 04:54:25,490
That's a good way to put it.

6245
04:54:26,030 --> 04:54:27,530
Okay, so I'm guessing it's this nipple.

6246
04:54:32,170 --> 04:54:33,410
Beam me up, nipple.

6247
04:54:36,570 --> 04:54:37,910
I don't want to go into the water.

6248
04:54:38,230 --> 04:54:39,270
I'm trying to avoid the water.

6249
04:54:40,050 --> 04:54:40,250
Ouch.

6250
04:54:43,610 --> 04:54:44,510
Did you save?

6251
04:54:49,640 --> 04:54:50,040
Yes?

6252
04:54:52,680 --> 04:54:53,620
I did, right?

6253
04:55:03,490 --> 04:55:05,190
I wanted to be full health.

6254
04:55:05,490 --> 04:55:05,970
Oh, God.

6255
04:55:06,270 --> 04:55:07,550
I'm going into the water!

6256
04:55:07,750 --> 04:55:08,550
And then I'm gonna get right out.

6257
04:55:08,550 --> 04:55:09,430
Okay.

6258
04:55:10,450 --> 04:55:11,310
Alright, alright.

6259
04:55:11,450 --> 04:55:12,170
This is a good place to save.

6260
04:55:12,310 --> 04:55:12,650
Okay, okay.

6261
04:55:15,410 --> 04:55:15,910
Oh.

6262
04:55:23,460 --> 04:55:23,960
Okay.

6263
04:55:24,340 --> 04:55:25,320
Let's try the other one.

6264
04:55:28,920 --> 04:55:29,920
Rog pad.

6265
04:55:30,480 --> 04:55:30,780
Maybe.

6266
04:55:33,780 --> 04:55:34,280
And...

6267
04:55:34,280 --> 04:55:34,700
Whoop!

6268
04:55:38,820 --> 04:55:40,460
Oh, I should have gotten my...

6269
04:55:40,460 --> 04:55:41,380
Big guns ready.

6270
04:55:54,330 --> 04:55:55,270
Oh, gosh.

6271
04:55:55,410 --> 04:55:56,050
He still got me.

6272
04:55:56,310 --> 04:55:56,530
No!

6273
04:56:02,920 --> 04:56:04,100
You may now die.

6274
04:56:04,320 --> 04:56:04,620
Is that what you...

6275
04:56:04,620 --> 04:56:05,500
Oh, no!

6276
04:56:05,500 --> 04:56:05,820
Oh!

6277
04:56:13,200 --> 04:56:15,000
I am about to die, huh?

6278
04:56:17,420 --> 04:56:19,860
Look at him doing a little jab over there.

6279
04:56:26,100 --> 04:56:27,480
It's okay, we can load.

6280
04:56:28,020 --> 04:56:30,980
And what I'll do is I'm gonna get this gun out.

6281
04:56:31,900 --> 04:56:32,600
Reload it.

6282
04:56:33,680 --> 04:56:40,560
We're gonna... take out the guy who's doing the zappies.

6283
04:56:42,320 --> 04:56:44,100
Oh wait, let me save on the other side.

6284
04:56:44,640 --> 04:56:47,200
We'll take on... take out the guy doing the zappies.

6285
04:56:48,400 --> 04:56:50,420
Yeah, I know you can cancel the portals.

6286
04:56:50,780 --> 04:56:54,900
I... just... I... didn't have a... chance to get behind anything.

6287
04:56:55,200 --> 04:56:55,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6288
04:56:59,060 --> 04:57:00,100
Okay, alright.

6289
04:57:00,360 --> 04:57:01,520
Guy that's doing the zappies.

6290
04:57:01,560 --> 04:57:02,260
Where are you at?

6291
04:57:03,240 --> 04:57:04,020
There you are.

6292
04:57:05,300 --> 04:57:05,820
Okay.

6293
04:57:11,010 --> 04:57:11,630
Oh my god.

6294
04:57:11,630 --> 04:57:12,750
Woo-wee-wee.

6295
04:57:36,960 --> 04:57:38,620
Woo-wee-wee-wee.

6296
04:57:40,080 --> 04:57:43,620
This is a nice big thick... um... wall.

6297
04:57:44,000 --> 04:57:44,900
Woo-we-wee-wee.

6298
04:57:51,230 --> 04:57:52,090
Booty Shot!

6299
04:57:52,250 --> 04:57:52,710
Booty Shot!

6300
04:57:53,510 --> 04:57:54,190
Where at?

6301
04:57:56,550 --> 04:57:57,990
Where at Booty Shot?

6302
04:57:59,490 --> 04:58:00,750
Oh, I think he's behind.

6303
04:58:01,130 --> 04:58:01,590
Okay, hold on.

6304
04:58:05,470 --> 04:58:08,090
Get that, get rid of that guy before he gets rid of me.

6305
04:58:17,910 --> 04:58:20,510
They don't call, that's why they don't call me revolver.

6306
04:58:28,180 --> 04:58:29,880
Yeah, eat that baby.

6307
04:58:34,630 --> 04:58:36,850
That's why they don't call me revolver.

6308
04:58:41,610 --> 04:58:42,630
Okay, we got a baby.

6309
04:58:44,350 --> 04:58:45,410
Was that a second baby?

6310
04:58:46,130 --> 04:58:47,130
Two babies down.

6311
04:58:50,130 --> 04:58:51,990
Oh my god, his head is open!

6312
04:58:52,470 --> 04:58:54,610
Oh, now I go up!

6313
04:58:54,810 --> 04:58:56,030
I see, I see!

6314
04:58:56,810 --> 04:58:57,290
Okay.

6315
04:58:59,750 --> 04:59:00,830
What is that noise?

6316
04:59:01,190 --> 04:59:01,850
What is that...

6317
04:59:01,850 --> 04:59:03,670
Oh, oh, it's the booty shot.

6318
04:59:04,050 --> 04:59:04,290
Ouch.

6319
04:59:06,010 --> 04:59:08,490
Oh no, uh...

6320
04:59:12,670 --> 04:59:13,550
I messed up.

6321
04:59:13,650 --> 04:59:13,970
Wait, hold on.

6322
04:59:13,970 --> 04:59:14,570
I'm gonna reload.

6323
04:59:14,790 --> 04:59:15,670
One moment, please.

6324
04:59:16,990 --> 04:59:17,850
One moment, please.

6325
04:59:19,690 --> 04:59:20,290
What the?

6326
04:59:20,530 --> 04:59:22,050
Oh no, I messed up.

6327
04:59:22,330 --> 04:59:22,610
No!

6328
04:59:22,850 --> 04:59:23,570
That's not what I'm about to do.

6329
04:59:23,690 --> 04:59:23,930
Hold on.

6330
04:59:24,210 --> 04:59:24,790
My bad.

6331
04:59:25,030 --> 04:59:25,810
Okay, excuse me.

6332
04:59:25,950 --> 04:59:26,270
There we go.

6333
04:59:26,370 --> 04:59:26,550
Okay.

6334
04:59:28,590 --> 04:59:28,990
Okay.

6335
04:59:29,370 --> 04:59:30,310
All right, all right, all right.

6336
04:59:30,530 --> 04:59:30,710
Nope.

6337
04:59:31,010 --> 04:59:31,910
Oh, nope, nope.

6338
04:59:32,130 --> 04:59:32,390
Yes.

6339
04:59:32,650 --> 04:59:33,810
And exchange.

6340
04:59:34,130 --> 04:59:34,250
Okay.

6341
04:59:34,250 --> 04:59:34,310
Okay.

6342
04:59:34,750 --> 04:59:36,190
Now, uh...

6343
04:59:38,230 --> 04:59:39,850
I wanna get him in the brains.

6344
04:59:40,790 --> 04:59:42,330
I wanna get his brains.

6345
04:59:42,730 --> 04:59:43,170
Uh...

6346
04:59:43,170 --> 04:59:44,230
Oh, here it is, here it is.

6347
04:59:44,390 --> 04:59:45,230
I was right next to it.

6348
04:59:46,230 --> 04:59:47,570
What am I getting electrocute?

6349
04:59:48,690 --> 04:59:50,070
Oh, never mind.

6350
04:59:50,810 --> 04:59:51,250
Uh...

6351
04:59:51,250 --> 04:59:51,930
It's this one?

6352
04:59:54,650 --> 04:59:55,890
It's this one, I think.

6353
04:59:59,810 --> 05:00:00,650
Uh...

6354
05:00:27,500 --> 05:00:29,600
Oh my god!

6355
05:00:31,020 --> 05:00:31,860
Oh!

6356
05:00:32,060 --> 05:00:32,660
Gee Man!

6357
05:00:33,520 --> 05:00:34,060
Awww!

6358
05:00:34,620 --> 05:00:44,160
Gordon Freeman in the flesh, or rather, in the hazard suit, I took the liberty of believing you of your weapons.

6359
05:00:44,160 --> 05:00:47,160
Most of them were government property.

6360
05:00:47,620 --> 05:00:51,020
As for the suit, I think you've earned it.

6361
05:00:51,560 --> 05:00:52,640
I have a suit?

6362
05:00:52,940 --> 05:00:53,020
Oh!

6363
05:00:54,300 --> 05:00:58,460
The border world, Zen, is in our control.

6364
05:00:58,720 --> 05:01:01,220
For the time being, thanks to you.

6365
05:01:01,640 --> 05:01:04,700
Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there.

6366
05:01:04,700 --> 05:01:05,420
You used me!

6367
05:01:10,700 --> 05:01:11,960
Oh, I can walk around.

6368
05:01:11,960 --> 05:01:14,840
What if I fall down here?

6369
05:01:15,300 --> 05:01:21,100
Mr. Freeman, I have recommended your services to my employers.

6370
05:01:21,920 --> 05:01:25,940
And they have authorized me to offer you a job.

6371
05:01:26,220 --> 05:01:31,220
They agree with me that you have limitless potential.

6372
05:01:31,940 --> 05:01:33,980
Limitless potential.

6373
05:01:35,040 --> 05:01:35,880
Easy toros!

6374
05:01:35,980 --> 05:01:37,420
Thank you so much for the take of the Deku!

6375
05:01:37,620 --> 05:01:43,320
You've proved yourself a decisive man, so I don't expect you'll have any trouble deciding what to do.

6376
05:01:43,900 --> 05:01:50,100
If you're interested, just step into the portal and I will take that as a yes.

6377
05:01:50,420 --> 05:01:51,220
I did save, guys.

6378
05:01:51,300 --> 05:01:51,540
Don't worry.

6379
05:01:51,540 --> 05:01:52,000
I saved.

6380
05:01:52,160 --> 05:01:53,220
Otherwise, well...

6381
05:01:54,540 --> 05:01:58,940
I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning.

6382
05:01:59,720 --> 05:02:01,140
Save here.

6383
05:02:01,360 --> 05:02:02,120
Instead?

6384
05:02:04,440 --> 05:02:04,560
Ok.

6385
05:02:05,460 --> 05:02:06,660
Thank you so much.

6386
05:02:07,480 --> 05:02:08,400
Thank you!

6387
05:02:08,400 --> 05:02:10,500
Time to choose.

6388
05:02:11,000 --> 05:02:11,280
What?

6389
05:02:11,920 --> 05:02:12,920
What am I choosing?

6390
05:02:13,900 --> 05:02:14,880
What do you want me to do?

6391
05:02:16,360 --> 05:02:18,120
It's time to choose.

6392
05:02:18,380 --> 05:02:18,640
Oh.

6393
05:02:19,340 --> 05:02:19,920
Time to choose?

6394
05:02:27,250 --> 05:02:30,890
Well, it looks like we won't be working together.

6395
05:02:31,090 --> 05:02:31,470
Oh.

6396
05:02:32,010 --> 05:02:34,550
No regrets, Mr. Freeman.

6397
05:02:34,550 --> 05:02:34,870
Ooh!

6398
05:02:48,940 --> 05:02:51,260
Declined offer of employment.

6399
05:02:58,130 --> 05:02:59,810
Valve is...

6400
05:02:59,810 --> 05:03:01,150
Mito.

6401
05:03:02,790 --> 05:03:04,490
Now go through the portal.

6402
05:03:04,750 --> 05:03:06,230
Okay, let's skip the...

6403
05:03:06,230 --> 05:03:08,750
Let's load my quicksave.

6404
05:03:09,010 --> 05:03:09,430
Endgame.

6405
05:03:10,610 --> 05:03:13,170
Oh, my game is glitched.

6406
05:03:14,930 --> 05:03:16,810
My game is glitched.

6407
05:03:17,070 --> 05:03:20,230
It's kind of epic, but it's kind of awesome.

6408
05:03:21,570 --> 05:03:22,290
Woohoo!

6409
05:03:25,170 --> 05:03:27,570
Wisely done, Mr. Freeman.

6410
05:03:27,930 --> 05:03:29,930
I will see you up ahead.

6411
05:03:35,640 --> 05:03:37,320
Oh, then it started over again.

6412
05:03:37,500 --> 05:03:37,700
Yay!

6413
05:03:39,120 --> 05:03:40,660
Awaiting assignment.

6414
05:03:51,730 --> 05:03:52,130
Yay!

6415
05:03:52,890 --> 05:03:53,810
We beat it!

6416
05:03:55,090 --> 05:03:55,490
I

6417
05:03:58,680 --> 05:04:06,980
was thinking with the baby, when everybody was saying that he had a weak point on his head, I was thinking that it was going to be like a little bitty hole at the top of his head.

6418
05:04:07,200 --> 05:04:09,280
And that's why I had to get up there, you know?

6419
05:04:11,320 --> 05:04:11,720
Ay!

6420
05:04:13,910 --> 05:04:14,030
Ay!

6421
05:04:14,890 --> 05:04:14,890
Ay!

6422
05:04:14,890 --> 05:04:15,130
Ay!

6423
05:04:15,610 --> 05:04:15,610
Ay!

6424
05:04:15,910 --> 05:04:17,510
Thank you for the big nipples!

6425
05:04:18,050 --> 05:04:20,490
Thank you!

6426
05:04:22,390 --> 05:04:26,770
Half-Life can be seen how cranky and mean sometimes, but she's got a unique charm.

6427
05:04:27,510 --> 05:04:27,710
True.

6428
05:04:28,370 --> 05:04:28,990
GG, nice run.

6429
05:04:29,110 --> 05:04:29,650
Thank you!

6430
05:04:31,690 --> 05:04:32,690
Thank you, thank you!

6431
05:04:34,810 --> 05:04:35,570
Mito gaming!

6432
05:04:36,070 --> 05:04:36,230
Yeah!

6433
05:04:36,590 --> 05:04:38,150
Well done, Miss Rantome.

6434
05:04:38,350 --> 05:04:38,970
Thank you!

6435
05:04:43,790 --> 05:04:45,150
Congratulations on beating Half-Life!

6436
05:04:45,150 --> 05:04:48,050
This is one of those games that just sticks with you after a while.

6437
05:04:48,290 --> 05:04:50,370
I can't wait to see you not rage at Half-Life 2!

6438
05:04:50,630 --> 05:04:51,550
It's honestly better!

6439
05:04:52,130 --> 05:04:52,250
Oh!

6440
05:04:52,610 --> 05:04:54,590
I thought you were being sarcastic for a second.

6441
05:04:58,740 --> 05:05:00,040
Please no spamming!

6442
05:05:00,260 --> 05:05:00,820
Thank you though!

6443
05:05:01,420 --> 05:05:02,240
Please no spamming!

6444
05:05:07,190 --> 05:05:08,210
It's a lot smoother.

6445
05:05:11,910 --> 05:05:15,010
Yeah, I'm excited for... I don't know if I'll do the...

6446
05:05:15,570 --> 05:05:17,170
If I'll do...

6447
05:05:17,710 --> 05:05:18,230
Um...

6448
05:05:18,230 --> 05:05:18,870
The DLC?

6449
05:05:19,470 --> 05:05:20,210
Or like the...

6450
05:05:20,210 --> 05:05:23,350
I guess it's considered DLC for this game before Half-Life 2?

6451
05:05:23,510 --> 05:05:23,970
Or what?

6452
05:05:25,330 --> 05:05:25,850
Oh...

6453
05:05:25,850 --> 05:05:27,110
I don't know yet.

6454
05:05:27,610 --> 05:05:28,350
Wow, Frank D!

6455
05:05:28,430 --> 05:05:29,330
Thank you so much!

6456
05:05:29,590 --> 05:05:31,610
Congrats, being a certified gamer!

6457
05:05:32,010 --> 05:05:32,390
Woohoo!

6458
05:05:35,130 --> 05:05:36,630
Yay, thank you!

6459
05:05:37,130 --> 05:05:38,390
Please do...

6460
05:05:38,390 --> 05:05:40,790
Please do take any breaks needed to heal.

6461
05:05:40,950 --> 05:05:41,590
Thank you!

6462
05:05:42,150 --> 05:05:43,550
Thank you so much.

6463
05:05:45,690 --> 05:05:46,290
Ah...

6464
05:05:46,290 --> 05:05:48,410
Don't forget all the thousands of mods.

6465
05:05:48,710 --> 05:05:48,890
Oh!

6466
05:05:49,610 --> 05:05:51,490
This was such a fun game though.

6467
05:05:52,610 --> 05:05:53,810
I'm still...

6468
05:05:53,810 --> 05:05:54,950
Like, what the heck?

6469
05:05:56,410 --> 05:05:58,150
I hope we get more...

6470
05:05:58,150 --> 05:06:01,710
More explanations, I suppose, in Half-Life 2.

6471
05:06:02,990 --> 05:06:03,470
Um...

6472
05:06:03,470 --> 05:06:05,610
The ending bit was...

6473
05:06:05,610 --> 05:06:06,390
I think that...

6474
05:06:06,390 --> 05:06:07,110
It was...

6475
05:06:07,710 --> 05:06:08,830
It was the...

6476
05:06:08,830 --> 05:06:09,990
Chapter before...

6477
05:06:09,990 --> 05:06:10,490
It was one...

6478
05:06:10,490 --> 05:06:11,970
The one that I was like sneaking around.

6479
05:06:12,630 --> 05:06:13,470
From the...

6480
05:06:13,470 --> 05:06:13,990
From the...

6481
05:06:13,990 --> 05:06:15,050
From the claw guys.

6482
05:06:16,510 --> 05:06:17,190
In the...

6483
05:06:17,190 --> 05:06:18,490
Like, in the last...

6484
05:06:18,490 --> 05:06:18,850
In the...

6485
05:06:18,850 --> 05:06:19,830
In Zen or whatever.

6486
05:06:20,130 --> 05:06:23,230
That one, I think, was the one that confused me the most.

6487
05:06:23,770 --> 05:06:25,070
Because it felt...

6488
05:06:25,070 --> 05:06:25,650
I don't know.

6489
05:06:25,770 --> 05:06:26,690
I felt like I was...

6490
05:06:26,690 --> 05:06:29,470
Was not going the right way like 50% of the time.

6491
05:06:30,450 --> 05:06:31,740
I was like...

6492
05:06:32,570 --> 05:06:33,170
Huh?

6493
05:06:33,670 --> 05:06:34,250
Huh?

6494
05:06:34,590 --> 05:06:34,990
Huh?

6495
05:06:36,390 --> 05:06:37,830
But, um...

6496
05:06:38,650 --> 05:06:41,070
I would like to see how everything looks.

6497
05:06:41,430 --> 05:06:41,790
Huh?

6498
05:06:41,910 --> 05:06:42,290
Sorry.

6499
05:06:42,430 --> 05:06:44,470
N is done in Black Mesa.

6500
05:06:44,470 --> 05:06:45,730
Uh...

6501
05:06:45,730 --> 05:06:46,290
So...

6502
05:06:46,290 --> 05:06:47,930
Will you play Blue Shift and Opposing Forces?

6503
05:06:48,570 --> 05:06:49,290
Probably.

6504
05:06:51,270 --> 05:06:51,630
Probably.

6505
05:06:53,530 --> 05:06:54,250
Probably.

6506
05:06:55,050 --> 05:06:56,230
I'd like to go through...

6507
05:06:56,850 --> 05:06:57,410
Oh...

6508
05:06:57,410 --> 05:06:58,550
Just heard something.

6509
05:06:58,690 --> 05:06:59,770
Sounded like someone fell outside.

6510
05:07:00,710 --> 05:07:01,270
Um...

6511
05:07:01,270 --> 05:07:02,990
I would like to go through...

6512
05:07:02,990 --> 05:07:03,630
The...

6513
05:07:03,630 --> 05:07:04,390
The series.

6514
05:07:05,790 --> 05:07:06,350
So...

6515
05:07:06,350 --> 05:07:07,190
Hmm...

6516
05:07:07,190 --> 05:07:09,730
But it was really cool to finally...

6517
05:07:09,730 --> 05:07:11,150
Play a classic like this.

6518
05:07:11,210 --> 05:07:11,510
You know?

6519
05:07:11,950 --> 05:07:13,310
Finally, I understand.

6520
05:07:14,170 --> 05:07:15,530
Well, I don't understand.

6521
05:07:15,530 --> 05:07:17,390
But finally, I'm like...

6522
05:07:17,390 --> 05:07:18,090
Oh, head crab.

6523
05:07:18,270 --> 05:07:18,590
Yeah, I know.

6524
05:07:18,730 --> 05:07:18,810
I...

6525
05:07:18,810 --> 05:07:20,270
I fought those now.

6526
05:07:20,470 --> 05:07:20,610
You know?

6527
05:07:20,730 --> 05:07:22,090
It feels so much better...

6528
05:07:22,090 --> 05:07:23,090
When you...

6529
05:07:23,090 --> 05:07:24,730
When you finally understand...

6530
05:07:24,730 --> 05:07:25,430
Like...

6531
05:07:25,430 --> 05:07:26,350
What things are from.

6532
05:07:27,430 --> 05:07:27,930
And...

6533
05:07:28,730 --> 05:07:29,810
Okay, what you mean?

6534
05:07:30,010 --> 05:07:30,270
Yeah!

6535
05:07:30,550 --> 05:07:31,630
I have the experience!

6536
05:07:32,270 --> 05:07:33,330
I killed the baby!

6537
05:07:33,710 --> 05:07:33,930
Woo!

6538
05:07:37,750 --> 05:07:40,370
Now it's time to host some multiplayer lobbies.

6539
05:07:40,670 --> 05:07:42,670
What is multiplayer like in this game?

6540
05:07:42,790 --> 05:07:43,830
Is it just the whole game?

6541
05:07:44,490 --> 05:07:44,850
But...

6542
05:07:44,850 --> 05:07:45,710
In multiplayer?

6543
05:07:47,310 --> 05:07:47,670
How?

6544
05:07:50,330 --> 05:07:52,570
Half-Life 2 adds way more story...

6545
05:07:52,570 --> 05:07:53,590
Is way more story heavy.

6546
05:07:53,650 --> 05:07:54,510
Adds some context.

6547
05:07:54,790 --> 05:07:55,630
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

6548
05:07:56,010 --> 05:07:57,050
Oh, it's deathmatch!

6549
05:07:57,130 --> 05:07:57,710
I think I...

6550
05:07:57,710 --> 05:07:59,290
Actually, I remember you guys telling me that.

6551
05:07:59,950 --> 05:08:02,430
If I hosted one and you guys joined, would you let me win?

6552
05:08:02,630 --> 05:08:03,630
I know you wouldn't.

6553
05:08:03,630 --> 05:08:04,290
No!

6554
05:08:05,370 --> 05:08:06,690
I know you wouldn't.

6555
05:08:07,290 --> 05:08:08,730
PvP deathmatch.

6556
05:08:08,970 --> 05:08:09,570
It's...

6557
05:08:09,570 --> 05:08:10,230
It's...

6558
05:08:10,230 --> 05:08:10,830
It's...

6559
05:08:10,830 --> 05:08:11,890
Half-Life Fortnite.

6560
05:08:12,630 --> 05:08:13,230
No.

6561
05:08:13,470 --> 05:08:14,170
I knew it.

6562
05:08:15,210 --> 05:08:17,010
Oh, I can't sell me out of here.

6563
05:08:17,450 --> 05:08:17,750
Ah!

6564
05:08:19,150 --> 05:08:19,490
Nah!

6565
05:08:20,770 --> 05:08:21,370
After...

6566
05:08:21,370 --> 05:08:23,510
After I started actually attacking the baby...

6567
05:08:23,510 --> 05:08:25,350
Instead of trying to get on top of its head...

6568
05:08:25,350 --> 05:08:26,270
It was so easy.

6569
05:08:30,250 --> 05:08:32,470
After I started actually attacking the baby...

6570
05:08:32,970 --> 05:08:34,190
It wasn't even that bad.

6571
05:08:35,450 --> 05:08:36,010
It wasn't...

6572
05:08:36,010 --> 05:08:36,430
Ha ha ha!

6573
05:08:38,130 --> 05:08:39,210
She said it was...

6574
05:08:39,210 --> 05:08:39,710
Easy.

6575
05:08:40,370 --> 05:08:41,430
Easy, baby!

6576
05:08:41,890 --> 05:08:42,570
Ha ha ha!

6577
05:08:43,610 --> 05:08:44,130
Ha ha ha ha!

6578
05:08:44,130 --> 05:08:44,510
Yup!

6579
05:08:44,970 --> 05:08:45,390
Ha ha ha!

6580
05:08:45,890 --> 05:08:46,930
I didn't say easy.

6581
05:08:46,970 --> 05:08:47,850
I said it wasn't bad.

6582
05:08:48,550 --> 05:08:51,070
Anyone else remember the G-Man squad series?

6583
05:08:51,510 --> 05:08:52,490
I don't know that.

6584
05:08:55,010 --> 05:08:55,870
Ha ha ha!

6585
05:08:56,810 --> 05:08:57,530
Ha ha ha ha!

6586
05:08:57,530 --> 05:08:58,870
The first part of that boss is the platform.

6587
05:09:00,050 --> 05:09:07,050
I tried to follow everybody's advice.

6588
05:09:07,490 --> 05:09:09,230
I should actually just shoot.

6589
05:09:09,890 --> 05:09:11,770
I'm never gonna follow advice again.

6590
05:09:12,910 --> 05:09:17,050
I'm a free... I'm minty free woman!

6591
05:09:24,680 --> 05:09:25,500
Good.

6592
05:09:26,100 --> 05:09:27,560
Never trust wisps.

6593
05:09:27,560 --> 05:09:28,140
Yeah!

6594
05:09:31,340 --> 05:09:33,460
Yeah, free woman.

6595
05:09:34,060 --> 05:09:34,740
Freeman?

6596
05:09:35,200 --> 05:09:35,740
Gordon Freeman?

6597
05:09:35,980 --> 05:09:36,140
Who?

6598
05:09:38,680 --> 05:09:40,160
Minty... Did I say minty?

6599
05:09:40,240 --> 05:09:41,320
Minky free woman.

6600
05:09:43,060 --> 05:09:43,740
Yeah!

6601
05:09:44,380 --> 05:09:45,320
But thank you guys!

6602
05:09:46,500 --> 05:09:49,960
I will probably go eat some dinner now.

6603
05:09:51,580 --> 05:09:53,180
She's gonna ignore us!

6604
05:09:54,940 --> 05:09:57,160
Now you understand why this game is a classic.

6605
05:09:57,160 --> 05:09:58,040
I know.

6606
05:10:00,140 --> 05:10:00,840
I do.

6607
05:10:01,300 --> 05:10:03,340
There were a lot of parts where I felt like I was really...

6608
05:10:04,020 --> 05:10:07,700
It's funny because the game feels so linear and then not at the same time.

6609
05:10:07,780 --> 05:10:09,200
And I was like, am I going the right way?

6610
05:10:09,380 --> 05:10:10,660
Like, so many times.

6611
05:10:11,880 --> 05:10:17,120
I was like, I feel like I'm not going where I need to go.

6612
05:10:20,080 --> 05:10:21,780
Blue shift is about two to three hours.

6613
05:10:21,920 --> 05:10:23,140
Opposing force is about two...

6614
05:10:23,140 --> 05:10:25,020
Two regular streams.

6615
05:10:25,860 --> 05:10:27,080
Or one long one.

6616
05:10:27,320 --> 05:10:27,700
Oh, okay.

6617
05:10:28,920 --> 05:10:29,700
Good to know.

6618
05:10:30,080 --> 05:10:30,520
Good to know.

6619
05:10:31,020 --> 05:10:31,340
Mm-mm.

6620
05:10:35,380 --> 05:10:35,820
So...

6621
05:10:35,820 --> 05:10:36,500
You did great.

6622
05:10:36,640 --> 05:10:38,200
Sorry for any strange pieces of help.

6623
05:10:38,200 --> 05:10:38,560
No!

6624
05:10:39,260 --> 05:10:39,380
No!

6625
05:10:39,960 --> 05:10:40,680
I under...

6626
05:10:40,680 --> 05:10:41,660
I, you know...

6627
05:10:41,660 --> 05:10:42,620
I think it's...

6628
05:10:42,620 --> 05:10:45,120
You know, when I'm in mid-battle, my...

6629
05:10:45,120 --> 05:10:47,380
My anxiety is high.

6630
05:10:47,760 --> 05:10:48,060
So...

6631
05:10:48,060 --> 05:10:48,880
I might...

6632
05:10:48,880 --> 05:10:50,800
Come off as like a...

6633
05:10:50,800 --> 05:10:51,200
Blah!

6634
05:10:51,420 --> 05:10:51,820
But...

6635
05:10:51,820 --> 05:10:54,220
I understand that people are just trying to help.

6636
05:10:54,280 --> 05:10:54,660
You know?

6637
05:10:54,660 --> 05:10:54,860
Now...

6638
05:10:54,860 --> 05:10:55,980
I get it.

6639
05:10:56,880 --> 05:10:59,000
Now you can watch the 20-minute speedrun.

6640
05:10:59,640 --> 05:11:00,480
Oh, yeah!

6641
05:11:01,120 --> 05:11:01,760
I can!

6642
05:11:01,920 --> 05:11:02,560
Of the game!

6643
05:11:03,200 --> 05:11:03,500
Yeah!

6644
05:11:03,760 --> 05:11:03,860
Yeah!

6645
05:11:04,900 --> 05:11:05,180
Mm.

6646
05:11:07,160 --> 05:11:07,600
So...

6647
05:11:07,600 --> 05:11:08,640
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

6648
05:11:09,380 --> 05:11:10,780
I'm also very passionate about this game.

6649
05:11:10,860 --> 05:11:11,040
Yeah!

6650
05:11:11,060 --> 05:11:12,320
It's one of those types of games, right?

6651
05:11:12,460 --> 05:11:15,360
But you guys were very helpful for a lot of it.

6652
05:11:15,480 --> 05:11:16,320
So thank you very much.

6653
05:11:16,320 --> 05:11:17,360
I really appreciate it.

6654
05:11:17,620 --> 05:11:17,760
Mm.

6655
05:11:18,700 --> 05:11:19,140
Yeah.

6656
05:11:19,540 --> 05:11:20,140
It's always...

6657
05:11:20,140 --> 05:11:20,580
It's always...

6658
05:11:20,580 --> 05:11:21,200
I feel like...

6659
05:11:21,200 --> 05:11:23,240
I feel like I'm playing with like a...

6660
05:11:23,240 --> 05:11:23,520
You know?

6661
05:11:23,620 --> 05:11:24,180
Like a bigger...

6662
05:11:24,180 --> 05:11:25,720
Older brother who's like...

6663
05:11:25,720 --> 05:11:27,100
Who's played the games.

6664
05:11:27,280 --> 05:11:28,440
And it's just like...

6665
05:11:28,440 --> 05:11:29,580
Mint, you gotta do this!

6666
05:11:29,900 --> 05:11:30,760
And I'm like, okay!

6667
05:11:32,880 --> 05:11:33,620
You know?

6668
05:11:33,860 --> 05:11:35,220
So it's like...

6669
05:11:35,860 --> 05:11:36,880
So it's...

6670
05:11:36,880 --> 05:11:37,660
It's like...

6671
05:11:37,660 --> 05:11:39,040
I'm playing...

6672
05:11:39,040 --> 05:11:40,080
With people.

6673
05:11:40,360 --> 05:11:40,700
It's fun.

6674
05:11:43,660 --> 05:11:44,900
Little sister Minto.

6675
05:11:45,360 --> 05:11:45,780
He-he.

6676
05:11:45,780 --> 05:11:46,680
He-he-he.

6677
05:11:48,660 --> 05:11:49,180
Yeah.

6678
05:11:50,660 --> 05:11:51,420
But yeah!

6679
05:11:51,840 --> 05:11:53,220
So I'm gonna go eat.

6680
05:11:54,220 --> 05:11:54,740
Um...

6681
05:11:54,740 --> 05:11:56,380
I'm glad I started this earlier.

6682
05:11:56,520 --> 05:11:57,940
It ended up being five hours.

6683
05:11:58,960 --> 05:11:59,320
Huh!

6684
05:11:59,460 --> 05:12:02,560
Now you know the context for full life consequences mostly.

6685
05:12:02,880 --> 05:12:03,100
Wait!

6686
05:12:03,280 --> 05:12:04,460
Can I watch that again?

6687
05:12:04,700 --> 05:12:06,080
And like...

6688
05:12:06,080 --> 05:12:07,320
Understand it?

6689
05:12:09,700 --> 05:12:12,240
Or do I have to play Half-Life 2 first?

6690
05:12:15,460 --> 05:12:20,600
If you ever finish Half-Life 2 Episode 2, you will understand the struggle of the fans from back in 2007.

6691
05:12:21,160 --> 05:12:21,740
Uh-oh.

6692
05:12:22,120 --> 05:12:22,560
Like...

6693
05:12:22,560 --> 05:12:23,520
Like the...

6694
05:12:23,520 --> 05:12:25,020
How it's not...

6695
05:12:25,020 --> 05:12:26,580
How it's not...

6696
05:12:27,720 --> 05:12:28,160
Um...

6697
05:12:28,160 --> 05:12:28,500
Uh...

6698
05:12:28,500 --> 05:12:28,860
Finished?

6699
05:12:29,160 --> 05:12:30,260
Like how there's no three?

6700
05:12:30,480 --> 05:12:30,960
After two.

6701
05:12:31,180 --> 05:12:31,500
Okay, okay.

6702
05:12:31,920 --> 05:12:32,560
Oh, Lambda!

6703
05:12:32,560 --> 05:12:33,020
Thank you!

6704
05:12:33,540 --> 05:12:36,520
I think you should try playing Hunt Down the Freeman too, Minky.

6705
05:12:36,720 --> 05:12:37,720
It's a really great spin-off.

6706
05:12:37,780 --> 05:12:40,280
I heard Kojima also worked on this game.

6707
05:12:40,460 --> 05:12:40,700
What?

6708
05:12:41,740 --> 05:12:43,160
Hunt Down the Freeman.

6709
05:12:48,660 --> 05:12:49,680
I like it up.

6710
05:12:52,800 --> 05:12:53,680
I like it up.

6711
05:12:54,020 --> 05:12:54,560
Wait, don't.

6712
05:12:54,920 --> 05:12:55,340
Wait, no.

6713
05:12:55,820 --> 05:12:56,160
Don't.

6714
05:12:56,500 --> 05:12:56,620
Wait.

6715
05:12:56,800 --> 05:12:57,320
Oh, it's a joke.

6716
05:12:57,740 --> 05:12:57,900
Oh.

6717
05:13:00,440 --> 05:13:00,880
Oh.

6718
05:13:01,400 --> 05:13:01,800
Oh.

6719
05:13:02,360 --> 05:13:02,800
Don't.

6720
05:13:02,920 --> 05:13:03,500
It's a meme.

6721
05:13:03,600 --> 05:13:03,800
Don't.

6722
05:13:03,960 --> 05:13:04,080
Oh.

6723
05:13:04,080 --> 05:13:04,820
She's...

6724
05:13:11,590 --> 05:13:13,190
I like that I...

6725
05:13:13,190 --> 05:13:13,530
I...

6726
05:13:13,530 --> 05:13:16,990
When I was typing it, I was not looking at chat.

6727
05:13:17,370 --> 05:13:20,130
And then I looked back to everyone being like...

6728
05:13:20,130 --> 05:13:20,850
Nooo.

6729
05:13:21,130 --> 05:13:22,450
In slow motion.

6730
05:13:24,470 --> 05:13:26,570
Here's a shorter version of what I super chat to you earlier.

6731
05:13:26,570 --> 05:13:27,910
There was a boss in Octopath 2.

6732
05:13:27,950 --> 05:13:28,110
Oh.

6733
05:13:28,570 --> 05:13:29,150
Thank you, Roka.

6734
05:13:29,350 --> 05:13:29,650
I'm so sorry.

6735
05:13:29,690 --> 05:13:30,370
No, I'm so sorry.

6736
05:13:30,510 --> 05:13:31,710
It felt like you had the super chat again.

6737
05:13:32,850 --> 05:13:33,790
I tried her again.

6738
05:13:34,030 --> 05:13:34,350
Oh.

6739
05:13:34,370 --> 05:13:36,130
A boss in Octopath 2 that you lost to.

6740
05:13:36,290 --> 05:13:38,970
I tried her again during your last stream and won this time.

6741
05:13:39,270 --> 05:13:40,530
Thank you, Miss Lucky Ghost.

6742
05:13:43,870 --> 05:13:45,930
Minto was baited by the Kojima mention.

6743
05:13:46,070 --> 05:13:46,870
I was like...

6744
05:13:46,870 --> 05:13:47,730
I didn't...

6745
05:13:47,730 --> 05:13:49,570
I didn't fully believe it.

6746
05:13:49,690 --> 05:13:50,510
Because I was like...

6747
05:13:50,510 --> 05:13:51,800
What did Kojima have...

6748
05:13:53,550 --> 05:13:55,290
At all to do with it?

6749
05:13:55,670 --> 05:13:55,970
You know?

6750
05:13:58,670 --> 05:13:59,210
But...

6751
05:13:59,210 --> 05:14:00,010
Yeah.

6752
05:14:01,670 --> 05:14:02,210
Silly.

6753
05:14:02,710 --> 05:14:04,590
Silly, silly, silly, silly.

6754
05:14:05,590 --> 05:14:09,570
Isn't terrible if you change to in-dev beta, but it's not official and not good.

6755
05:14:09,570 --> 05:14:11,510
Oh, well, I don't even know what it is.

6756
05:14:11,890 --> 05:14:13,910
Half-Life directed by Kojima though.

6757
05:14:14,930 --> 05:14:15,690
I feel like...

6758
05:14:15,690 --> 05:14:19,490
I almost feel like Death Stranding is as close as what you're gonna get to that.

6759
05:14:21,630 --> 05:14:24,990
I somehow feel like Death Stranding is...

6760
05:14:25,410 --> 05:14:27,570
Like the closest you'll get to a...

6761
05:14:28,110 --> 05:14:29,690
Half-Life directed by...

6762
05:14:30,710 --> 05:14:31,270
Kojima.

6763
05:14:35,130 --> 05:14:38,870
I highly recommend the documentary Valve release for the 20th anniversary.

6764
05:14:39,570 --> 05:14:40,690
Also, thank you for the gift sub.

6765
05:14:41,070 --> 05:14:41,190
Oh!

6766
05:14:41,650 --> 05:14:42,890
Thank you whoever gifted the sub.

6767
05:14:43,330 --> 05:14:45,990
I would like to watch that probably once I finish the games though.

6768
05:14:50,420 --> 05:14:51,820
Half-Life has no cut scenes though.

6769
05:14:51,940 --> 05:14:52,140
True?

6770
05:14:52,740 --> 05:14:53,760
True, true, true.

6771
05:14:53,920 --> 05:14:54,360
Oh my gosh.

6772
05:14:54,840 --> 05:14:56,360
Well, I can already see like...

6773
05:14:57,380 --> 05:14:58,320
Like the game...

6774
05:14:59,300 --> 05:15:02,380
Doesn't look like MGS1, but it's close enough.

6775
05:15:02,380 --> 05:15:03,780
You know where...

6776
05:15:03,780 --> 05:15:04,660
So during...

6777
05:15:04,660 --> 05:15:06,920
During some of the hallways I could see how like...

6778
05:15:06,920 --> 05:15:08,520
Kojima might frame it.

6779
05:15:08,700 --> 05:15:09,180
Or like...

6780
05:15:09,180 --> 05:15:09,820
How...

6781
05:15:09,820 --> 05:15:11,500
He would show off like the headcrabs...

6782
05:15:12,100 --> 05:15:12,520
Kind of like...

6783
05:15:13,080 --> 05:15:14,240
Down the hallways.

6784
05:15:14,260 --> 05:15:15,000
Or something like that.

6785
05:15:15,260 --> 05:15:15,500
You know?

6786
05:15:15,940 --> 05:15:17,400
It's a lot of environmental storytelling.

6787
05:15:17,640 --> 05:15:18,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6788
05:15:19,220 --> 05:15:21,860
It's a fan mod that was overhyped and...

6789
05:15:21,860 --> 05:15:22,720
Under good.

6790
05:15:22,900 --> 05:15:24,380
Is the best way to describe it.

6791
05:15:24,380 --> 05:15:25,260
I see.

6792
05:15:25,640 --> 05:15:27,760
Are there any other classics you want to try out?

6793
05:15:28,480 --> 05:15:30,380
There's a lot of games I want to try out.

6794
05:15:32,220 --> 05:15:32,620
Hmm...

6795
05:15:33,360 --> 05:15:33,760
Hmm...

6796
05:15:33,760 --> 05:15:35,000
I still gotta start...

6797
05:15:35,000 --> 05:15:36,680
I still gotta start at...

6798
05:15:36,680 --> 05:15:38,020
Very beginning Ace Combat.

6799
05:15:38,620 --> 05:15:40,700
I don't know if we would consider that a classic.

6800
05:15:43,000 --> 05:15:43,400
But...

6801
05:15:44,740 --> 05:15:45,140
Uh...

6802
05:15:46,180 --> 05:15:46,580
Uh...

6803
05:15:46,580 --> 05:15:48,080
I gotta do Death Stranding.

6804
05:15:48,140 --> 05:15:48,800
That's not a classic.

6805
05:15:49,000 --> 05:15:49,820
But I really want to do that.

6806
05:15:49,940 --> 05:15:50,340
Especially...

6807
05:15:50,340 --> 05:15:53,580
I don't think I'll be able to get in before Death Stranding 2, unfortunately.

6808
05:15:54,240 --> 05:15:54,760
But...

6809
05:15:54,760 --> 05:15:55,540
Halo!

6810
05:15:55,880 --> 05:15:56,060
Yes!

6811
05:15:56,780 --> 05:15:57,300
Halo!

6812
05:15:59,180 --> 05:15:59,700
Halo!

6813
05:16:00,300 --> 05:16:01,140
Would be great.

6814
05:16:01,380 --> 05:16:02,000
More Castlevania?

6815
05:16:02,140 --> 05:16:02,380
Yeah!

6816
05:16:02,680 --> 05:16:04,240
More Castlevania would be great.

6817
05:16:05,380 --> 05:16:05,760
Uh...

6818
05:16:05,760 --> 05:16:07,160
Portal 1 actually...

6819
05:16:07,160 --> 05:16:09,080
Does have lore relating to Half-Life.

6820
05:16:09,500 --> 05:16:10,600
Once you've played this...

6821
05:16:10,600 --> 05:16:11,400
Really?

6822
05:16:11,980 --> 05:16:13,080
Wait, that's so exciting!

6823
05:16:13,360 --> 05:16:13,840
Oh my gosh.

6824
05:16:14,460 --> 05:16:15,700
Now I'm gonna have to replay Portal.

6825
05:16:18,300 --> 05:16:21,060
If you're ever looking for a spooky game that's a classic...

6826
05:16:21,060 --> 05:16:23,440
You could try the Blair Witch Project.

6827
05:16:26,350 --> 05:16:27,430
A childhood?

6828
05:16:28,290 --> 05:16:30,770
Didn't they have a Blair Witch Project game?

6829
05:16:31,210 --> 05:16:32,970
Wasn't that just a couple years ago?

6830
05:16:33,370 --> 05:16:34,710
But also...

6831
05:16:36,430 --> 05:16:37,110
I...

6832
05:16:40,270 --> 05:16:40,670
I...

6833
05:16:41,630 --> 05:16:42,710
A few years back.

6834
05:16:42,830 --> 05:16:43,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6835
05:16:44,210 --> 05:16:44,610
I...

6836
05:16:44,610 --> 05:16:45,650
Yeah, the one with the dog.

6837
05:16:45,810 --> 05:16:48,030
I won't ever play that game because of the dog.

6838
05:16:48,490 --> 05:16:50,850
Not to get into spoilers or anything.

6839
05:16:51,270 --> 05:16:53,010
But I feel like this is good to know.

6840
05:16:53,230 --> 05:16:55,270
If you do want to play this kind of game.

6841
05:16:55,270 --> 05:16:56,270
Because...

6842
05:16:56,270 --> 05:16:57,590
There's a scene...

6843
05:16:57,590 --> 05:17:00,010
In the Blair Witch Project where...

6844
05:17:00,010 --> 05:17:01,370
The dog gets hurt.

6845
05:17:01,730 --> 05:17:03,290
And like you're carrying him.

6846
05:17:03,430 --> 05:17:04,630
And he's just like...

6847
05:17:04,630 --> 05:17:05,810
He's just whimpering.

6848
05:17:06,850 --> 05:17:07,450
And...

6849
05:17:07,450 --> 05:17:07,970
I...

6850
05:17:07,970 --> 05:17:08,430
I...

6851
05:17:09,050 --> 05:17:09,650
I...

6852
05:17:10,210 --> 05:17:10,910
I won't...

6853
05:17:10,910 --> 05:17:11,350
I won't...

6854
05:17:11,350 --> 05:17:12,150
I can't do it.

6855
05:17:12,250 --> 05:17:12,630
No, no.

6856
05:17:12,770 --> 05:17:14,110
I can't do that kind of stuff.

6857
05:17:14,450 --> 05:17:15,390
I guess...

6858
05:17:15,390 --> 05:17:18,950
I hate when horror hurts animals just for the shock factor.

6859
05:17:20,090 --> 05:17:20,970
It's so...

6860
05:17:20,970 --> 05:17:21,330
Mm-mm.

6861
05:17:21,550 --> 05:17:21,910
Mm-mm.

6862
05:17:22,070 --> 05:17:22,370
Mm-mm.

6863
05:17:23,530 --> 05:17:23,970
I...

6864
05:17:23,970 --> 05:17:25,290
I'm really, really against that.

6865
05:17:25,870 --> 05:17:27,610
Planning to play the Splinter Cell series.

6866
05:17:27,790 --> 05:17:28,170
Oh!

6867
05:17:29,030 --> 05:17:29,470
Ugh!

6868
05:17:31,590 --> 05:17:32,430
You know what?

6869
05:17:32,530 --> 05:17:33,610
In the past...

6870
05:17:33,610 --> 05:17:35,070
If you had asked me...

6871
05:17:35,070 --> 05:17:37,210
If you had asked me...

6872
05:17:37,830 --> 05:17:38,050
Like...

6873
05:17:38,650 --> 05:17:39,730
Three years ago.

6874
05:17:40,010 --> 05:17:40,910
Even two years ago.

6875
05:17:41,130 --> 05:17:42,130
If I would play Splinter Cell.

6876
05:17:42,350 --> 05:17:43,390
I would have told you no.

6877
05:17:43,550 --> 05:17:44,350
But now...

6878
05:17:44,750 --> 05:17:45,670
I might consider it.

6879
05:17:45,710 --> 05:17:47,210
Though I've heard it's much more difficult.

6880
05:17:48,270 --> 05:17:48,710
So...

6881
05:17:52,870 --> 05:17:53,390
Hmm...

6882
05:17:53,390 --> 05:17:54,530
I've heard it's more difficult.

6883
05:17:55,390 --> 05:17:55,910
But...

6884
05:17:55,910 --> 05:17:56,750
I...

6885
05:17:56,750 --> 05:17:58,390
Am willing to try it.

6886
05:17:59,310 --> 05:18:01,650
Just to say that I've tried it.

6887
05:18:01,850 --> 05:18:02,450
You know what I mean?

6888
05:18:02,790 --> 05:18:03,130
Hahaha.

6889
05:18:03,630 --> 05:18:05,290
Not because I wanna be like...

6890
05:18:05,290 --> 05:18:05,610
Oh...

6891
05:18:05,610 --> 05:18:07,230
I love stealth games now.

6892
05:18:07,350 --> 05:18:08,010
I love Metal Gear.

6893
05:18:08,110 --> 05:18:08,950
I love stealth games.

6894
05:18:09,230 --> 05:18:09,750
But...

6895
05:18:09,750 --> 05:18:11,830
Just because I wanna be like...

6896
05:18:11,830 --> 05:18:12,430
Hmm...

6897
05:18:13,310 --> 05:18:14,950
I feel like...

6898
05:18:15,790 --> 05:18:17,370
As a Metal Gear fan...

6899
05:18:17,370 --> 05:18:18,590
People will say like...

6900
05:18:18,590 --> 05:18:20,470
Oh, you need to try Splinter Cell 2.

6901
05:18:20,950 --> 05:18:22,430
Or Splinter Cell as well.

6902
05:18:22,730 --> 05:18:23,930
And if I say...

6903
05:18:23,930 --> 05:18:24,230
Ah...

6904
05:18:24,230 --> 05:18:24,490
No.

6905
05:18:25,630 --> 05:18:26,590
But if I say...

6906
05:18:26,590 --> 05:18:27,410
Oh yeah, I tried it.

6907
05:18:27,470 --> 05:18:28,150
I didn't like it.

6908
05:18:28,190 --> 05:18:29,690
I can at least say that I tried it.

6909
05:18:30,990 --> 05:18:31,390
Hmm...

6910
05:18:31,390 --> 05:18:32,250
Max Payne.

6911
05:18:32,530 --> 05:18:32,590
Haha.

6912
05:18:33,110 --> 05:18:34,450
Since we're on a topic of recommendations.

6913
05:18:34,710 --> 05:18:35,930
I don't know how we got on this topic.

6914
05:18:36,330 --> 05:18:36,650
Haha.

6915
05:18:37,430 --> 05:18:38,230
Crypta FM.

6916
05:18:38,870 --> 05:18:40,410
I've never heard of that one either.

6917
05:18:41,050 --> 05:18:42,270
Thank you, DFT.

6918
05:18:42,770 --> 05:18:43,930
I've never heard of that actually.

6919
05:18:44,130 --> 05:18:45,250
Two games beaten in two days.

6920
05:18:45,410 --> 05:18:46,310
Three of you count Visage.

6921
05:18:46,310 --> 05:18:46,850
Yeah!

6922
05:18:47,270 --> 05:18:48,070
We're killing it!

6923
05:18:50,430 --> 05:18:51,450
You were very...

6924
05:18:51,970 --> 05:18:55,250
Literally distracted and derailed by a Splinter Cell meme on your...

6925
05:18:55,250 --> 05:18:57,410
May 3rd, 2024 stream.

6926
05:19:03,300 --> 05:19:03,860
Wait!

6927
05:19:03,980 --> 05:19:05,200
Exactly one year ago?

6928
05:19:07,380 --> 05:19:07,940
Really?

6929
05:19:09,160 --> 05:19:09,720
Wow.

6930
05:19:10,520 --> 05:19:11,460
I don't remember...

6931
05:19:11,460 --> 05:19:13,520
I think I vaguely remember the meme.

6932
05:19:13,760 --> 05:19:15,280
But I also don't remember it.

6933
05:19:15,340 --> 05:19:16,260
I remember seeing it.

6934
05:19:16,320 --> 05:19:17,320
I don't remember what it was.

6935
05:19:19,460 --> 05:19:22,540
If you do one split jump on Splinter Cell...

6936
05:19:22,540 --> 05:19:23,740
I'd say that's enough.

6937
05:19:27,120 --> 05:19:29,180
Haven't seen some VTubers stream Max Payne.

6938
05:19:30,620 --> 05:19:31,160
Wait.

6939
05:19:31,280 --> 05:19:32,480
What kind of game is Max Payne?

6940
05:19:35,060 --> 05:19:36,240
Is it FPS?

6941
05:19:48,090 --> 05:19:49,450
Third person.

6942
05:19:51,650 --> 05:19:52,130
Actually...

6943
05:19:52,130 --> 05:19:53,450
Speaking of third person shooter...

6944
05:19:55,770 --> 05:19:56,250
Mogu...

6945
05:19:56,250 --> 05:19:57,250
Mogu asked me...

6946
05:19:57,250 --> 05:19:57,930
She was just like...

6947
05:19:57,930 --> 05:19:58,550
Do you want to play?

6948
05:19:58,830 --> 05:19:59,510
She asked...

6949
05:19:59,510 --> 05:20:00,930
She invited me to...

6950
05:20:00,930 --> 05:20:01,790
It was like...

6951
05:20:01,790 --> 05:20:02,210
Oh gosh.

6952
05:20:02,770 --> 05:20:04,530
I can't remember what the other game was.

6953
05:20:04,670 --> 05:20:05,790
I think it was like...

6954
05:20:06,810 --> 05:20:07,290
Wow.

6955
05:20:07,290 --> 05:20:08,430
Let me just open up Discord.

6956
05:20:10,570 --> 05:20:11,050
Mogu...

6957
05:20:11,050 --> 05:20:11,610
Where are you?

6958
05:20:11,710 --> 05:20:12,050
There you are.

6959
05:20:12,530 --> 05:20:14,490
She asked if I wanted to play...

6960
05:20:14,490 --> 05:20:15,630
Split Fiction?

6961
05:20:16,450 --> 05:20:17,410
Or RE5?

6962
05:20:17,410 --> 05:20:18,390
And I was like...

6963
05:20:18,390 --> 05:20:18,730
Oh my gosh.

6964
05:20:18,830 --> 05:20:20,410
I've been wanting to get into Resident Evil.

6965
05:20:20,790 --> 05:20:21,630
So I was like...

6966
05:20:21,630 --> 05:20:23,510
Let's play Resident Evil 5, please!

6967
05:20:25,670 --> 05:20:26,190
So...

6968
05:20:26,770 --> 05:20:27,290
Probably...

6969
05:20:27,290 --> 05:20:29,530
It won't be until I...

6970
05:20:29,530 --> 05:20:30,230
Until the...

6971
05:20:30,230 --> 05:20:31,450
Until the end of...

6972
05:20:31,450 --> 05:20:33,730
Until I get back from my Japan trip.

6973
05:20:34,330 --> 05:20:34,850
So...

6974
05:20:34,850 --> 05:20:36,470
In June...

6975
05:20:36,470 --> 05:20:37,910
Sometime maybe...

6976
05:20:37,910 --> 05:20:38,590
We'll start it.

6977
05:20:39,350 --> 05:20:40,790
Or maybe later this month.

6978
05:20:40,850 --> 05:20:41,210
I don't know.

6979
05:20:41,350 --> 05:20:42,330
When I'm less busy.

6980
05:20:43,110 --> 05:20:43,630
Or...

6981
05:20:43,630 --> 05:20:44,890
No, I'm gonna be more busy...

6982
05:20:44,890 --> 05:20:45,310
Later this month.

6983
05:20:45,530 --> 05:20:48,570
I remember there was a time...

6984
05:20:48,570 --> 05:20:49,310
When the MGS series...

6985
05:20:49,310 --> 05:20:50,170
Is almost forgotten...

6986
05:20:50,170 --> 05:20:51,670
And Sam from Splinter Cell series...

6987
05:20:51,670 --> 05:20:52,370
Made a note to...

6988
05:20:52,370 --> 05:20:52,770
Yes!

6989
05:20:52,770 --> 05:20:54,390
I've seen that cutscene...

6990
05:20:54,390 --> 05:20:55,170
They're talking about...

6991
05:20:55,170 --> 05:20:55,930
Where he's just like...

6992
05:20:55,930 --> 05:20:57,310
I guess it's just me then.

6993
05:20:57,590 --> 05:20:57,950
Yeah!

6994
05:20:58,150 --> 05:20:58,870
I've seen that!

6995
05:21:00,350 --> 05:21:01,850
RE5 is peak goofy fun.

6996
05:21:02,030 --> 05:21:03,250
I wanna play it so bad.

6997
05:21:03,850 --> 05:21:05,090
Have you played the other RE games?

6998
05:21:05,150 --> 05:21:05,770
I've only played...

6999
05:21:06,470 --> 05:21:07,390
And this is so bad.

7000
05:21:07,490 --> 05:21:08,230
I've only...

7001
05:21:08,230 --> 05:21:08,950
Literally only played...

7002
05:21:08,950 --> 05:21:10,230
Resident Evil 1.

7003
05:21:10,230 --> 05:21:11,730
And that was...

7004
05:21:11,730 --> 05:21:13,310
I didn't beat it or anything.

7005
05:21:13,550 --> 05:21:13,970
It was...

7006
05:21:13,970 --> 05:21:15,290
When I was a kid...

7007
05:21:15,290 --> 05:21:16,710
And I was playing like...

7008
05:21:17,470 --> 05:21:18,390
Silent Hill...

7009
05:21:18,390 --> 05:21:19,250
And everything like that.

7010
05:21:19,710 --> 05:21:20,170
So...

7011
05:21:22,250 --> 05:21:22,710
Yeah.

7012
05:21:23,210 --> 05:21:24,190
Max Payne is technically...

7013
05:21:24,190 --> 05:21:25,590
The beginning of the Remedyverse...

7014
05:21:25,590 --> 05:21:27,330
Which includes control and...

7015
05:21:27,330 --> 05:21:27,550
Oh!

7016
05:21:27,730 --> 05:21:28,290
Oh my gosh!

7017
05:21:28,370 --> 05:21:28,550
Gato!

7018
05:21:28,770 --> 05:21:29,550
I literally...

7019
05:21:29,550 --> 05:21:29,910
When you...

7020
05:21:29,910 --> 05:21:31,730
I just thought about Owl and Wake...

7021
05:21:31,730 --> 05:21:32,150
And I was like...

7022
05:21:32,150 --> 05:21:33,070
I wanna play those too!

7023
05:21:33,470 --> 05:21:34,690
There's so many games!

7024
05:21:34,930 --> 05:21:36,590
There's too many games to play!

7025
05:21:36,590 --> 05:21:36,630
Yay!

7026
05:21:37,330 --> 05:21:37,810
Oh!

7027
05:21:38,150 --> 05:21:39,510
I'm canceling all my...

7028
05:21:39,510 --> 05:21:40,130
Concerts.

7029
05:21:42,090 --> 05:21:43,290
I'm canceling them!

7030
05:21:43,470 --> 05:21:44,470
So I can play more games.

7031
05:21:44,990 --> 05:21:45,470
Just kidding.

7032
05:21:47,650 --> 05:21:48,390
Just kidding.

7033
05:21:48,530 --> 05:21:50,430
Max Payne and the other Remedy games are amazing.

7034
05:21:50,570 --> 05:21:51,090
You'd love them.

7035
05:21:51,710 --> 05:21:52,810
Sam Lake is...

7036
05:21:52,810 --> 05:21:54,170
Finish Hideo Kojima.

7037
05:21:54,310 --> 05:21:54,990
Ask Maddie?

7038
05:21:55,170 --> 05:21:55,890
Okay, I will.

7039
05:21:56,990 --> 05:21:57,950
JK on this?

7040
05:21:59,570 --> 05:22:00,090
Nah...

7041
05:22:02,950 --> 05:22:03,470
Yeah.

7042
05:22:04,770 --> 05:22:05,770
RE2 is the best.

7043
05:22:06,390 --> 05:22:06,910
I...

7044
05:22:06,910 --> 05:22:08,650
I don't know if I should play the originals.

7045
05:22:09,190 --> 05:22:10,590
I really don't wanna play original...

7046
05:22:11,230 --> 05:22:12,270
Resident Evil.

7047
05:22:12,870 --> 05:22:13,930
But I'm like...

7048
05:22:13,930 --> 05:22:14,490
Do I play...

7049
05:22:15,530 --> 05:22:17,490
The remakes or the originals?

7050
05:22:17,590 --> 05:22:17,970
I don't know.

7051
05:22:20,010 --> 05:22:20,530
But...

7052
05:22:22,290 --> 05:22:23,150
I've heard...

7053
05:22:23,150 --> 05:22:24,490
Mixed about everything.

7054
05:22:24,770 --> 05:22:25,430
You should play the remakes.

7055
05:22:25,530 --> 05:22:26,230
The remakes are good.

7056
05:22:27,030 --> 05:22:27,470
Yeah.

7057
05:22:30,480 --> 05:22:31,000
Oh!

7058
05:22:31,120 --> 05:22:32,160
Lollipop Chainsaw!

7059
05:22:32,160 --> 05:22:32,500
Yeah.

7060
05:22:34,060 --> 05:22:36,440
I have not played it myself.

7061
05:22:36,460 --> 05:22:37,600
But I do know it.

7062
05:22:38,660 --> 05:22:39,340
No More Heroes?

7063
05:22:39,520 --> 05:22:41,800
I think I actually watched Maddie play No More Heroes.

7064
05:22:41,900 --> 05:22:42,080
Wait.

7065
05:22:42,440 --> 05:22:43,240
Was it No More Heroes?

7066
05:22:43,360 --> 05:22:43,560
No.

7067
05:22:43,980 --> 05:22:45,500
What's the one that curses a lot?

7068
05:22:45,620 --> 05:22:46,280
And has the...

7069
05:22:46,280 --> 05:22:47,360
The gun that...

7070
05:22:48,120 --> 05:22:49,080
It's another...

7071
05:22:49,080 --> 05:22:50,200
Grasshopper game.

7072
05:22:54,520 --> 05:22:56,060
It's like really raunchy.

7073
05:22:58,340 --> 05:22:59,380
Shadows of the Damned!

7074
05:23:00,140 --> 05:23:00,720
Was that it?

7075
05:23:00,720 --> 05:23:01,260
Let me check.

7076
05:23:01,760 --> 05:23:03,100
I think that's the one I watched.

7077
05:23:03,340 --> 05:23:05,060
Shadows of the Damned.

7078
05:23:07,060 --> 05:23:07,520
The...

7079
05:23:07,520 --> 05:23:08,260
Yes.

7080
05:23:13,020 --> 05:23:14,180
It got a re...

7081
05:23:14,180 --> 05:23:15,460
It got a remake recently.

7082
05:23:16,380 --> 05:23:17,300
For Killer7.

7083
05:23:18,840 --> 05:23:20,440
For those who don't know who I'm talking about.

7084
05:23:20,560 --> 05:23:20,880
Maddie.

7085
05:23:21,000 --> 05:23:23,500
She goes by Oh That's Raspberry on...

7086
05:23:24,100 --> 05:23:24,560
Twitter.

7087
05:23:24,840 --> 05:23:26,020
Maddie's a big Grasshopper fan.

7088
05:23:26,020 --> 05:23:27,180
She's a big Grasshopper fan.

7089
05:23:27,360 --> 05:23:27,940
And she...

7090
05:23:28,860 --> 05:23:29,300
Worked...

7091
05:23:29,300 --> 05:23:30,060
Works...

7092
05:23:30,060 --> 05:23:31,200
Worked for...

7093
05:23:31,200 --> 05:23:32,240
Grasshopper even.

7094
05:23:32,720 --> 05:23:33,160
So...

7095
05:23:33,160 --> 05:23:34,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7096
05:23:34,300 --> 05:23:34,740
She...

7097
05:23:34,740 --> 05:23:35,300
She...

7098
05:23:35,300 --> 05:23:36,000
She made it.

7099
05:23:36,240 --> 05:23:38,000
She was a fan who made it.

7100
05:23:40,560 --> 05:23:41,660
That's Shadows of the Damned.

7101
05:23:41,740 --> 05:23:41,920
Okay.

7102
05:23:41,980 --> 05:23:42,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7103
05:23:43,220 --> 05:23:44,360
But she's really...

7104
05:23:44,360 --> 05:23:44,980
She's really great.

7105
05:23:45,080 --> 05:23:45,800
She's one of my friends.

7106
05:23:45,800 --> 05:23:47,600
She does those MGS comics.

7107
05:23:47,720 --> 05:23:48,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7108
05:23:49,180 --> 05:23:49,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7109
05:23:49,560 --> 05:23:50,180
She's really great.

7110
05:23:50,380 --> 05:23:50,860
I love her.

7111
05:23:51,040 --> 05:23:51,600
She streams.

7112
05:23:52,240 --> 05:23:52,720
So...

7113
05:23:52,720 --> 05:23:53,300
Um...

7114
05:23:53,300 --> 05:23:54,720
If you ever wanna see some...

7115
05:23:54,720 --> 05:23:55,900
She does a lot of like...

7116
05:23:55,900 --> 05:23:56,880
Niche things too.

7117
05:23:57,200 --> 05:23:57,360
So...

7118
05:23:57,360 --> 05:23:58,220
If you ever...

7119
05:23:58,220 --> 05:23:59,960
Wanna watch someone play some like...

7120
05:23:59,960 --> 05:24:00,780
Niche video games.

7121
05:24:00,820 --> 05:24:01,540
I'm pitching...

7122
05:24:01,540 --> 05:24:03,380
I'm pitching her Twitch right now.

7123
05:24:04,460 --> 05:24:05,880
I love her so much.

7124
05:24:06,820 --> 05:24:07,940
She's a super sweetheart.

7125
05:24:10,280 --> 05:24:11,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7126
05:24:12,500 --> 05:24:13,460
But um...

7127
05:24:13,460 --> 05:24:13,660
Mmm.

7128
05:24:14,480 --> 05:24:14,940
Mmm.

7129
05:24:17,280 --> 05:24:20,580
I actually told her how to make Snake barf on MGS3 when she streamed it.

7130
05:24:20,700 --> 05:24:21,320
No way!

7131
05:24:25,310 --> 05:24:25,970
Half-Life.

7132
05:24:26,070 --> 05:24:27,530
More like half my wife.

7133
05:24:28,010 --> 05:24:30,050
Anyway, Maddie's comics rule and we love you.

7134
05:24:30,190 --> 05:24:31,470
Enjoy the end of Gordon's adventure.

7135
05:24:31,890 --> 05:24:33,890
Wait, what do you mean end of Gordon's adventure?

7136
05:24:34,210 --> 05:24:36,430
I'm gonna play him again in 2, right?

7137
05:24:44,810 --> 05:24:45,290
Yes.

7138
05:24:46,850 --> 05:24:47,330
Yeah.

7139
05:24:48,470 --> 05:24:48,830
Yes.

7140
05:24:49,250 --> 05:24:49,550
Yes.

7141
05:24:51,290 --> 05:24:52,410
Thanks for the Half-Life stream.

7142
05:24:52,710 --> 05:24:53,590
Miss Free Woman.

7143
05:24:53,770 --> 05:24:54,470
Thank you, Kavu!

7144
05:24:55,390 --> 05:24:55,970
And Pirate.

7145
05:24:56,070 --> 05:24:58,530
I don't think yours is gonna get through all the other...

7146
05:24:58,530 --> 05:24:59,710
Super chats and everything.

7147
05:24:59,870 --> 05:25:00,710
So thank you, I see you.

7148
05:25:00,810 --> 05:25:01,130
Don't know.

7149
05:25:01,310 --> 05:25:02,430
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

7150
05:25:02,810 --> 05:25:04,290
And thank you guys for the stream.

7151
05:25:04,530 --> 05:25:05,310
I'm gonna head out now.

7152
05:25:06,250 --> 05:25:07,110
I'm gonna go...

7153
05:25:07,110 --> 05:25:09,070
I'm gonna go eat like I said I would before.

7154
05:25:10,350 --> 05:25:11,270
Thank you, thank you.

7155
05:25:12,130 --> 05:25:13,530
Oh, it did make it through.

7156
05:25:13,710 --> 05:25:14,250
Look at that!

7157
05:25:14,690 --> 05:25:15,170
Yippee!

7158
05:25:18,560 --> 05:25:19,040
Guys!

7159
05:25:19,720 --> 05:25:20,520
Have a good day.

7160
05:25:20,820 --> 05:25:21,460
Have a good night.

7161
05:25:21,680 --> 05:25:23,540
Tomorrow is DMC5.

7162
05:25:24,220 --> 05:25:24,700
So...

7163
05:25:24,700 --> 05:25:25,860
I'll get some rest...

7164
05:25:25,860 --> 05:25:28,760
I gotta do my daily login so I can get a gorb.
