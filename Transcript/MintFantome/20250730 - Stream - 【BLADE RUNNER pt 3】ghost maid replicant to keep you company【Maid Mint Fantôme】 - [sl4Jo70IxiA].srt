1
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,570
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,050
Hi, hi.

3
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,480
The Blade Runner.

4
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,660
John Blade Runner.

5
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,220
McCoy.

6
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,820
That guy.

7
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,140
Yeah.

8
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,240
Howdy, howdy.

10
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,060
Yeah.

11
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,580
How are you gonna defeat them?

12
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,260
With my... with my... Blade.

13
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,040
I studied.

14
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,620
I studied.

15
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,720
I think I have to... I just realized.

16
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,980
I think I have to... move the game over.

17
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,460
We'll see.

18
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,940
The guy behind you has a gun.

19
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,640
Well, I've got... these guns.

20
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,160
Brandon, happy birthday!

21
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,400
Okay, Blade's birthday.

22
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,760
Happy birthday!

23
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,640
Happy birthday.

24
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,820
Gamershop Minto shirt arrived.

25
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,260
I'm so ready to Mint Max.

26
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,660
Thank you for getting it, pal.

27
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,640
Thank you.

28
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,400
Thank you.

29
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,780
Um... I studied the Blade.

30
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,700
I got your waifu cup.

31
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,900
Wow, thank you!

32
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
It's my birthday today.

33
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,820
Soberguy, happy birthday!

34
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,040
Happy, happy birthday.

35
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,700
It's Mothra's...

36
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,840
64th birthday tomorrow.

37
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,420
Well, happy birthday.

38
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,480
It's basically you.

39
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,380
Happy birthday, Mothra.

40
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,240
Yeah.

41
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,800
Um, I... I actually...

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,120
I looked up a walkthrough.

43
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,500
Hold on, let me get it ready.

44
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
I have...

45
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,900
I have three tabs of walkthroughs open at the moment.

46
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,420
We'll see if any of them work.

47
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,780
I actually don't remember...

48
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,120
Where...

49
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,830
I don't remember.

50
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,630
Currently watching the stream of my new Bito shirt.

51
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,010
Thank you for...

52
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,050
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

53
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,570
Getting pumped for MGS Con.

54
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,330
Do you have a panel?

55
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,130
Whether you join karaoke or only enjoying...

56
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,830
We're still discussing, actually.

57
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,750
Everything that I am doing.

58
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,610
I think I have several things I am doing.

59
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,770
So if you go to MGS Con...

60
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,190
You may see me several places.

61
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,190
Oh no, the music.

62
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,090
New cup, shirt, and mat.

63
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:24,870
Thank you!

64
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:26,650
Thank you!

65
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,130
And I thought...

66
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,550
Since you're like big...

67
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,670
Robots...

68
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,390
Just can't lie.

69
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,750
Have you heard of...

70
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,070
Megaton Musashi?

71
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,290
Sounds familiar.

72
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,290
Sounds familiar.

73
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,250
Arigato, arigato.

74
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,910
Choo!

75
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,830
I'm lonely.

76
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,850
Can you fix that?

77
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,610
Anyway, hope you are doing well today.

78
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,350
I can fix that with a stream!

79
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,310
Oh my gosh!

80
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:51,870
Wow!

81
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,790
Imagine like hanging out...

82
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,510
In stream and...

83
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,590
You know...

84
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,490
Oh my gosh!

85
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,610
Wow!

86
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:04,730
Wait!

87
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,710
Oh my gosh, you're right!

88
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,130
YouTube did fix the names!

89
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,230
What is going on?

90
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,810
What are they thinking there?

91
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,650
Why are the names changing every other day?

92
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,850
I'm so confused.

93
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,770
I'm so confused!

94
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,970
When I first saw your stream, I honestly didn't know what to expect, but over time, you've won my heart time and time again.

95
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,690
Will you be my Oshie?

96
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,350
Oh my gosh, Brian!

97
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,230
I'll think about it!

98
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,230
Once you declare me your Oshie, you can't change.

99
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,070
Yeah.

100
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,150
Think long and hard about it.

101
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,630
Yeah.

102
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,670
I'm doomed, then.

103
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,750
Been real sicky.

104
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,710
Eris!

105
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,910
Feel better.

106
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,710
This is a treat.

107
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,630
Back to lurking.

108
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,510
Oh, okay.

109
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,510
Get better.

110
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,150
Kami Oshie.

111
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,710
No, no, no.

112
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,590
It doesn't have to be Kami Oshie, but just Oshie.

113
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,770
Forever.

114
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,430
Yeah.

115
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,350
So, shall we?

116
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,790
Shall we get back into it?

117
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,710
Our girlfriend is a wisp now!

118
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:36,270
She said that you're sweet for asking me about her and said we should both propose to you when we intend to be angry with you.

119
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,430
Sulkin, did I just steal your girl?

120
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,250
Mr. Steal Your Girl?

121
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,430
Mid-Fent-O-Wisp.

122
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,890
Wait a second.

123
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,620
It's the subject of dreams.

124
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,880
Wait, what do you mean subject?

125
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
What did we talk about dreams?

126
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,220
From last stream, I have reoccurring dreams where I find a weird building in my neighborhood that I don't remember being there.

127
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,940
And almost every time it ends up being a food court.

128
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,280
Are you hungry?

129
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,200
Are you going to bed without eating or something?

130
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,400
Anything?

131
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,520
Okay.

132
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,120
Oh, there we go.

133
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,120
Why the mouth sensitivity is so bad?

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,160
Alright.

135
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,480
Where?

136
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,320
Where did we...

137
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,520
Okay.

138
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,800
Hysteria Hall.

139
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,940
Okay.

140
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,540
I know that.

141
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,500
What did we end up...

142
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,740
Oh.

143
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,440
Okay, I do remember I went in here and then I got shot at.

144
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,880
So, currently... Currently, we are on the run, baby.

145
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,840
We are running away from the cops.

146
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,620
I guess... I think it's that they think we're a replicant, no?

147
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,140
Watching Mint on... Mint on Company time.

148
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,820
Let's go!

149
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,820
I got your Game Recepts Cup on my birthday.

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,240
Yay!

151
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,300
Thank you.

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,560
Thank you so much for getting it.

153
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,940
I really appreciate it, you guys.

154
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,560
Thank you.

155
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,000
Shooty... Yeah, we're gonna shoot, probably.

156
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,640
We might be a replicant.

157
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,200
Oh, yeah, they think that we murdered the Katana guy.

158
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,880
That's right.

159
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,220
Uh, Izoy.

160
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,180
Izoy.

161
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:26,660
Izoy.

162
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Izoy.

163
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,040
Izoy.

164
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,380
Izoy.

165
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,860
Izoy.

166
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,420
Izzy.

167
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,140
That guy.

168
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,380
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

169
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,100
And... We are... Um... Yes, we are on the run.

170
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,680
So... Inzoy!

171
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:40,940
Izoy?

172
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,360
No.

173
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,560
What's his name?

174
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,360
What is his name?

175
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,280
Hmm... I don't remember.

176
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,940
But, um... Okay, hold on.

177
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,220
Animal murderer.

178
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,760
Oh, golly.

179
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,220
Okay.

180
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,260
Oh, shoot.

181
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,000
I wish there was something that I could, like...

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,200
Give us a, like, a... Hey, this is what you should be doing.

183
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,740
There's something about the moon bus we gotta do.

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,380
That can't be me.

185
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,060
Yeah, we are at the moon bus.

186
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,640
We might be a replicant.

187
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,740
Guys, if we're a replicant...

188
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna go...

189
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,100
Rambo style on everybody.

190
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,060
It says, I'm so... Thank you so much for the thank you for the...

191
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,620
Thank you!

192
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,460
Thank you, thank you.

193
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,860
Um, there's this guy.

194
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,320
He murdered, um...

195
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,060
Eisenduller, who was the guy in the anti-gravity.

196
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,340
And... Oh my gosh.

197
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,260
There's, like, a freaking fly around me.

198
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,000
Go away!

199
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,800
Um... Hmm.

200
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,460
And then...

201
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,720
What else?

202
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,420
Moon bus.

203
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,600
Alright, let's go back to...

204
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,400
Okay, one thing I do wanna see is if...

205
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,460
Okay, we were trying to talk to Lucy before.

206
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,620
I want to see if we could talk to her.

207
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
I also don't remember...

208
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,880
Is this where my car is?

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,580
I think we don't have my car.

210
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,220
So I'm a little like...

211
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,220
What are you calling me stinky for?

212
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,260
Is it because I've been running around in the sewers...

213
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,880
And I'm disgusting and sweaty?

214
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,120
I need to ask you...

215
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,440
Yeah, I need to ask you what I'm doing.

216
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,800
Okay, where was my car?

217
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,020
Great question.

218
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,780
I don't want to get anywhere that I need to go.

219
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,240
Hold on.

220
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,040
Maybe this guy knows anything.

221
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Like I said, I have walkthroughs open.

222
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,800
I don't know if they'll be useful.

223
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,660
Pour me one.

224
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,060
Just one?

225
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,600
One but one good one.

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,900
Yeah, but one good one.

227
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,660
I flubbed it.

228
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,520
One but one good one.

229
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,660
Okay, he doesn't know anything.

230
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,420
He just wants us drunk.

231
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,400
Cops hate this one simple ghost.

232
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,860
Click here to find out more.

233
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,660
Yeah, click the subscribe button.

234
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,700
Cedar, thank you so much for the five group to take.

235
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,180
One but one good one.

236
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,380
One but one good one.

237
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,460
Do you know anything?

238
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,280
Thanks for your time.

239
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,880
Literally nothing?

240
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,280
Okay.

241
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:13,860
How?

242
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,120
What about in here?

243
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,700
Do you think he's going to attack me?

244
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,540
Because I'm...

245
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,220
What's that word on the...

246
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,640
The land?

247
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,660
Be on the lookout for Ray McCoy.

248
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,260
Last seen in the fourth sector.

249
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,380
Subject is armed and extremely dangerous.

250
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,700
No, I'm not extreme.

251
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,420
Oh, shoot.

252
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,580
No, no.

253
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,900
Scum sucking skin jobs everywhere.

254
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,320
What just happened?

255
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,180
I died of cringe.

256
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,260
What happened?

257
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,040
Did he shoot me?

258
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,980
My

259
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:05,920
God.

260
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,120
Link forgot him.

261
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,460
No.

262
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,520
Oh my gosh.

263
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,400
Wait, you are really Moe Mothra.

264
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,320
Okay, this is the nightclubs.

265
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,620
Remember, we got sexy ladies up here.

266
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
It looks like a half bra.

267
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,980
And then you got ladies inside the boobs.

268
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,060
Crazy.

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,340
That's some crazy work.

270
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,300
Okay, our car is not here.

271
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,540
Where do you...

272
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:32,940
Okay, hold on.

273
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm just going to load.

274
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,320
Excuse me.

275
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm loading.

276
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,760
Look at my game.

277
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,220
All right.

278
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,180
We know not to go through there.

279
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,380
Okay.

280
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,920
We died.

281
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,020
We definitely died.

282
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,000
But I'm not quite sure.

283
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,780
Maybe I do need to shoot those cops.

284
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,240
To get anywhere, maybe.

285
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,260
It's time to go...

286
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,480
They were in here.

287
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,360
I'm almost positive.

288
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Where does this go?

289
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,560
Unless they're over...

290
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,180
If I right click to get my gun out...

291
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,840
It stops me from...

292
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,300
Oh!

293
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,000
I didn't go this way, did I?

294
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,780
Okay, never mind.

295
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,380
I think maybe I went into that other area...

296
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,000
Too...

297
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,500
Too...

298
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:16,720
Too...

299
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,180
Too...

300
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,120
Just be in a safety zone.

301
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,260
Dude, what happened?

302
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,320
Everything all right?

303
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,660
I died of cringe.

304
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,560
I died of cringe.

305
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay, hold on.

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,300
No, I am going to get my gun out.

307
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,120
Okay, here we go.

308
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm ready to shoot.

309
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,160
Ooh.

310
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,100
Tasty.

311
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,420
Okay, so this leads up.

312
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Where does this go?

313
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,380
Okay.

314
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,300
And then we have this door over here.

315
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,140
Is that all we've got going on around here?

316
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,300
Can I drink the bath water?

317
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,800
Let's go over here.

318
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,800
Mountain Dew water.

319
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,740
I put on my wizard robe and hat.

320
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,080
Shut the hell up.

321
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,580
Why are you even saying that?

322
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,690
All of this looks so familiar.

323
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,850
But, like, I don't remember why.

324
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,010
I feel like there's, like, a shootout in here or something.

325
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,830
This...

326
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,770
Is there anything here?

327
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:17,930
Hello?

328
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,210
Nowhere?

329
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,490
Okay.

330
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,630
Well, at least we...

331
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,150
What?

332
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,610
What is here?

333
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,830
Okay.

334
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:31,770
I...

335
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,530
All right.

336
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,330
So we will go out the sewer this way.

337
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,910
And see where we end up.

338
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,530
I'm on the run.

339
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:43,910
It's...

340
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,390
I said...

341
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,390
I'm on the lam.

342
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,670
Is that what I'm thinking of?

343
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,930
I am Pingu.

344
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,410
Welcome to members of the Hingu.

345
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,490
Oh, I remember.

346
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,310
I was going to move the game over a little bit.

347
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:54,850
I'm so sorry.

348
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,710
You guys, give me a second.

349
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,430
There we go.

350
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,010
There we go.

351
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,550
Okay, okay.

352
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,530
I'm on the lam.

353
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,310
Okay.

354
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,130
What's up here?

355
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,830
I don't know where I am.

356
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,610
Wait, isn't this just the hotel?

357
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,230
Is this the hotel?

358
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,410
I'm home!

359
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,690
Oh, no.

360
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,130
They're going to be waiting for me, huh?

361
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:25,930
At my...

362
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,530
Apartment.

363
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,950
At my apartment?

364
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:28,930
Roof.

365
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,110
Roof.

366
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:30,930
Roof.

367
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,970
I think they're going to be waiting for me.

368
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,170
My dog!

369
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,030
McCoy, 88F.

370
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,830
Wait, my dog.

371
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,530
Maggie!

372
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,250
Thank you.

373
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,270
Uh-oh.

374
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,330
Is my dog okay?

375
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,750
Where's Maggie?

376
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,510
Where's my...

377
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,770
Where's my animal?

378
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,370
My dog, motherfucker.

379
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,390
Ain't no Maggie here.

380
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,530
She was here last night when I left.

381
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,570
You got the wrong place, Jack.

382
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,050
What?

383
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,770
Hey, man.

384
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,590
I live here.

385
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,870
I don't know what your speed load is.

386
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,930
And I really don't care.

387
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,270
Wait a minute.

388
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,390
I got no problem icing you if that's what you want, Jack.

389
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,410
My name's not Jack.

390
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,530
Um.

391
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,310
Give me your floor number, please.

392
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,830
They kicked me out of my house!

393
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,190
Apartments.

394
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,310
They kicked me out of my house!

395
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,450
Maggie!

396
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,830
Oh, my God!

397
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,290
Wait, do you think if I go back, he'll yell at me?

398
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,430
Or he'll kill me?

399
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,490
McCoy, 88F.

400
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,070
Destination, loft.

401
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,770
Strange.

402
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,610
Strange.

403
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,790
Your floor number, please.

404
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,270
Apartments.

405
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,310
Roof.

406
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,230
Destination, loft.

407
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,950
You won't let me even go to the roof!

408
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,270
What?

409
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,250
Roof.

410
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:48,830
Roof.

411
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,270
Oh, my God.

412
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,770
Oh, my God.

413
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,190
We can't even go to the roof!

414
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,450
No way!

415
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,350
Oh, my God.

416
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,410
But it's...

417
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,750
Wait, does it still say McCoy for the apartment?

418
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,930
Does it still say?

419
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,410
Your floor number, please.

420
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:07,870
Roof.

421
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,370
It does.

422
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,490
Freaky.

423
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,290
Where's our dog again?

424
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,470
Let's go to the police station, I think we can, from this way?

425
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,930
Wait, why would we want to go there?

426
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,330
I don't think we want to go to the police...

427
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,030
I don't...

428
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,650
I don't...

429
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,030
I don't know where else to go!

430
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,630
Okay, hold on.

431
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,430
I'm going to save real quick.

432
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,930
Wait a second.

433
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:37,610
19...

434
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,350
Oh, okay, okay.

435
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,690
Yeah, I have to start saving from down here.

436
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:41,850
Yeah.

437
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:42,910
Okay.

438
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,510
I guess we're going to go turn ourselves in!

439
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,650
Was Maggie a hallucination?

440
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,050
No!

441
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,610
Maggie was real!

442
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,000
Maggie was real!

443
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,100
Talk to the guy who asked if you killed anyone.

444
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,380
Yeah.

445
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,080
That guy...

446
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,340
I think he's a little...

447
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,200
I think he's a figment of our imagination.

448
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,600
Locked!

449
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,860
You can't just lock the police station!

450
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,400
Wait, what do you mean it's locked?

451
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,570
Locked.

452
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,990
No kidding!

453
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,890
What?

454
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,740
Officer, please!

455
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,840
I have an emergency!

456
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,160
What's going on?

457
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,880
Locked.

458
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,560
Tried to turn myself in, but they were closed.

459
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,580
Yeah, I guess I'll come back tomorrow.

460
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Wait, where the heck am I supposed to go then?

461
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,340
I can't go to the...

462
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,640
I can't turn myself in!

463
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,120
I can't even go to the roof!

464
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,320
Where's my car?

465
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't remember where I parked it!

466
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,680
Oh, man!

467
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,090
Trap...

468
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,530
This sewer travel is really...

469
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,750
Bumming me out.

470
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,750
I think...

471
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,390
There has to be something in here, no?

472
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,610
Jarvis, check the bar.

473
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,250
They probably took our car, I imagine.

474
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,440
We never got to talk to the girl.

475
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,940
I can't remember her name.

476
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,300
Amy?

477
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,740
Lucy?

478
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,320
Lucy.

479
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,140
Let's find the turtles and have pizza.

480
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,320
Cowabunga!

481
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,340
Sinar, thank you so much for your five more gifted.

482
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:32,940
Thank you.

483
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,120
I can't find anything in here.

484
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,780
I can't.

485
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,720
I can't.

486
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,460
This...

487
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,400
Goes back.

488
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:39,760
Yeah.

489
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,300
Okay, let's go fight some cops.

490
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,320
Let's go shoot some coppers.

491
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,980
Ha ha ha ha ha.

492
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,240
I messed with the wrong McCoy.

493
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,710
I'm gonna save right here, though.

494
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,430
Ha ha ha ha.

495
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,310
Before we do.

496
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,090
Ha ha ha ha.

497
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,050
Wait, is this the one that I just saved?

498
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,050
What did I just save?

499
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,130
Oh, it's moving it up here.

500
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:15,650
How fun.

501
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:15,990
Wait.

502
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,230
Yeah.

503
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,030
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,470
That's the date.

505
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,770
Yes.

506
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,250
Yes.

507
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:20,990
Okay.

508
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,450
I got my guns out.

509
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,410
Let's go.

510
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:23,770
Let's go.

511
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,150
Let's go.

512
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:24,570
Let's shoot.

513
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,890
Let's shoot.

514
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:25,330
Let's shoot.

515
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,910
One shot.

516
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,950
One kill, baby.

517
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:31,950
Oh.

518
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,610
Wait, the police are gone.

519
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,390
Hello?

520
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,610
They were definitely here before.

521
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,150
I remember.

522
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,170
Wait.

523
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:38,550
Oh?

524
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,630
Okay.

525
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,730
I'm running.

526
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,850
Can you imagine how wet his socks are?

527
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:48,930
Whoa.

528
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,150
Whoa.

529
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:51,890
Whoa.

530
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,660
That was audio, by the way.

531
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,280
Wait, where'd the cops go?

532
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,600
I was so ready to shoot.

533
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,900
Wait.

534
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,880
Let me get my gun out.

535
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,140
Okay.

536
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm ready to shoot.

537
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,610
And I mean, though, I'm just gonna keep listening with my eyes closed.

538
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,910
Until sleep takes me.

539
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,530
Good night.

540
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,890
Good night, good night.

541
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,050
What's in here?

542
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,630
Oh, spooky red.

543
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:28,930
All right.

544
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,550
Let's go in.

545
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,770
With my gun out.

546
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,490
I'm ready to kill.

547
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,590
Where's my dog?

548
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,230
This is subtly turned into...

549
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,090
This is subtly...

550
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,390
This is subtly...

551
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,350
John Wick.

552
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,050
Hey, another one?

553
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,810
Have you ever heard of private property?

554
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,310
John Wick.

555
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,790
Yeah, yeah.

556
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,010
Hey, buddy.

557
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,610
Oh, he's got the pizza.

558
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,950
Wait, while we need her, the turtles.

559
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,250
He's got the pizza.

560
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:04,970
Can I shoot?

561
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,430
I can kill this guy.

562
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,370
Holy cow.

563
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,890
I'll talk to him.

564
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,390
Oh, I can't talk to him.

565
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,130
Oh, yes, I can.

566
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,070
Hey.

567
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,050
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

568
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:15,850
Have I?

569
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,430
Hmm.

570
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,210
Always chasing.

571
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:21,850
That your name?

572
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,710
Chaser?

573
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,390
Chaser.

574
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,650
But that big, dumb locks out the back of the sushi bar, remember?

575
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,390
Ow!

576
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,310
Small world, ain't it?

577
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,910
Hmm, guess so.

578
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,110
Guess so.

579
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,690
And again, I ain't the one standing in your living room.

580
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,010
Well, um...

581
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,750
Uh, others.

582
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,010
You've got another one, when I came down the elevator.

583
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,890
Not a lot of people.

584
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,830
Artificials.

585
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,030
How'd you know they were replicants?

586
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,410
Are you kidding?

587
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,150
I can spot a skin job at a hundred paces in the dark.

588
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,230
Describe them to me.

589
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,150
Describe them to me.

590
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,470
You don't got that drink?

591
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,290
Drink?

592
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,710
Maybe later.

593
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,930
Well, there's the Japanese guy with the coat and the glasses.

594
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,150
Skinny guy, blonde hair, ponytail?

595
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,370
Yeah.

596
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,410
And, uh, the guy with the muscles and the funny hair.

597
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,950
Who?

598
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,130
Dreadlocks?

599
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,570
Right, I've seen him twice.

600
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,490
And a two-headed guy, the fat man.

601
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,430
Fat man?

602
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,270
Fat man?

603
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,770
The one I was chasing from the sushi bar.

604
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,230
Nah, the other fat man.

605
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:24,910
You know him.

606
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,090
The Metal Gear Fat Man.

607
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,370
Oh, it's the fat man.

608
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,290
Fat man honestly belongs in this series, no?

609
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,390
Fat man!

610
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,230
Laugh and grow fat.

611
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,030
How many times have you seen the fat man down here?

612
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,750
Bunch of times.

613
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,450
Last time weren't that long ago.

614
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,230
The fat man.

615
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,910
What was he doing?

616
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,630
Collecting guns like always.

617
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,070
Handguns?

618
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,350
A blaster like mine?

619
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,490
Handguns, rifles, a whole armful.

620
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,130
Took them through that gate.

621
00:25:59,130 --> 00:25:59,770
Oh gosh.

622
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,190
Wait.

623
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,130
Dumped them in the sewer.

624
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,790
The sewer?

625
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,190
Here go now.

626
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,090
Sure you ain't got nothing to drink?

627
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,670
Can you describe him?

628
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,410
Yeah, rough guy.

629
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,970
He bucks out orders a lot.

630
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,870
He's got roller skates and he's rollerblading.

631
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,650
Let me ask you something.

632
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,370
Cooked it be.

633
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,430
Damn tasty.

634
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,370
Does he need a drink?

635
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,030
Oh!

636
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,390
Bring me looking good.

637
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,940
Hey wake up!

638
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,560
Let me ask you something.

639
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,300
Wake up!

640
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,240
He's asleep.

641
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,140
He will never hear from him again.

642
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,800
KFC!

643
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,340
He's got them chicken wangs.

644
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:49,980
Wait!

645
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,260
Are we gonna die over here?

646
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,010
Okay.

647
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,210
Wowee.

648
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,810
This looks like a pretty...

649
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,710
Like a boss fight of a room, no?

650
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,090
So the guns are in here?

651
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,850
This is from OG Fallout.

652
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,970
This looks like it's from Fallout.

653
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,370
No kidding?

654
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,830
There's nothing else we can do in here, so...

655
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,390
Okay.

656
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,190
We can go the other way.

657
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,090
That...

658
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:34,950
Well good.

659
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,830
We came in here and we got to talk to that guy.

660
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,430
Very cool.

661
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,250
Very cool.

662
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,770
I'm Fat Man.

663
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,150
I like the lighting here.

664
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,070
Even...

665
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,010
Even...

666
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,770
The game is very...

667
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,730
You know, like this is...

668
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,130
A video game of Blade Runner and it's so cinematic, no?

669
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,870
I wanna walk out in the middle and reveal my plan.

670
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,430
Right?

671
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,790
I was thinking like some guy would come out and be like...

672
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,130
Haha.

673
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,450
I think I've got you gut.

674
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,250
So I'm gonna tell you everything.

675
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,990
Where did the cops go?

676
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,870
Maybe they left because now we can act...

677
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,470
Before we weren't supposed to go this way.

678
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,190
And now we can go this way.

679
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,430
Maybe today is the pizza party at the...

680
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,730
At the...

681
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,150
At the cops...

682
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,510
At the police station.

683
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,530
And so...

684
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,150
Okay.

685
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,210
So over to the right is the hotel.

686
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,330
I can't remember where I was trying to go.

687
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:30,870
Oh.

688
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,200
Maybe that's why it's closed though, you know?

689
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
Just gonna save over this one.

690
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,100
Actually, we'll save over this one.

691
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,280
Peace.

692
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:50,840
Okay.

693
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,080
Pizza party.

694
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,860
Kinda nice.

695
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,640
For sure.

696
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,260
Have you seen my dog?

697
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,300
You seen any suspicious types around here lately?

698
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,920
And my dog?

699
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,440
Ali, that's all I do see.

700
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,480
You think this is a club met or something?

701
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,240
Okay.

702
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,280
Very helpful.

703
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,040
Thank you.

704
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,380
Hmm.

705
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,090
Wait.

706
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,730
What did I get?

707
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,230
Nothing.

708
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:24,690
Oh.

709
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,970
Way to get my hopes up.

710
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,170
McCoy, come on.

711
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,390
Wait.

712
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,810
But how do I go upstairs?

713
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,750
I cannot anymore.

714
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,170
Oh wait.

715
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:38,970
Uh...

716
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,190
Oh, how was that?

717
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,950
McCoy looks lonely.

718
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,090
If he finds the pizza party, will it fix that?

719
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,310
Absolutely.

720
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,750
I'm trying to remember.

721
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,710
Actually, I remember how to get back into that one room.

722
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,090
I'm just kind of exploring everywhere around now because I'm like...

723
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,790
Also, there was a car here, no?

724
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,670
A crashed car?

725
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,510
It's gone now.

726
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,050
Wait.

727
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,150
Oh, okay.

728
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,210
I thought this was an opening for something, but it's not.

729
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,450
Oh!

730
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,310
Is that a bird?

731
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,030
Wow.

732
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,070
Pizza fills the void.

733
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,770
It dies.

734
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,370
I think he says, yuck.

735
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,330
Totally uninteresting.

736
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,470
Totally uninteresting.

737
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:16,870
Never mind.

738
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,070
This is not disgusting to him.

739
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,210
Okay, this goes into the hotel room that we had gotten kidnapped in.

740
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,430
If you guys remember.

741
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,890
Yeah.

742
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,350
And we saw...

743
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,050
Okay, you don't need to keep doing that.

744
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,970
We saw Lucy here.

745
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,650
Pizza!

746
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,130
Are those cheeks?

747
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,310
Nothing else there.

748
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,970
Okay, well, I guess there's nothing else here.

749
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,590
You found the mo- Oh.

750
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,810
Sorry, I made a big old loop table.

751
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,120
Oopsie.

752
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,560
I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing.

753
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,060
I'm so confused.

754
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,220
But we're...

755
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,620
I think this goes...

756
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:35,980
into...

757
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,980
that area we were just in.

758
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,820
So, no...

759
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,240
going...

760
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,280
no need to go back there.

761
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,660
Let's go talk.

762
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,380
Do you think they've cleaned up the mess at the sushi place?

763
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,100
I sure hope so.

764
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,240
Wow!

765
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,620
Where does he get this gunk from?

766
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,920
Is he taken from the sewer?

767
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,420
Hello?

768
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,400
Hello?

769
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,480
Hello?

770
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,960
Is there anybody that can help me with where I need to go?

771
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,360
I'm so lost.

772
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,960
You!

773
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,820
McCoy, LPD.

774
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,220
McCoy!

775
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,780
That's me!

776
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,760
I'm LPD!

777
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,800
Excuse me, pal.

778
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,520
Excuse me, pal, please!

779
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,380
Excuse me, pal.

780
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,220
Excuse me, pal.

781
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,580
Everybody's my pal tonight.

782
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,200
I don't think that they...

783
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,340
I think this restaurant might be a front.

784
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,240
Do you know the song Be Sweet by the band Japanese Breakfast?

785
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,440
Is it okay if I request that one for the next karaoke?

786
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,080
Um...

787
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,460
I don't know it, but I can look into it.

788
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,440
Thank you, Matthew!

789
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,740
I'll try to remember, but I might forget.

790
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,620
Cause I'm playing the game.

791
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,440
So thank you so much for the super chatting!

792
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,860
Hound has a real green goop problem.

793
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,020
I just...

794
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,340
Well, maybe it's not a problem because apparently you can eat it.

795
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,300
So...

796
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,220
Um...

797
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,660
Okay, now I actually don't know what to do because...

798
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,820
I can't go home.

799
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,160
I feel like all of my options are...

800
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,680
Wait, how did I get out of the sewer?

801
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,420
Uh...

802
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,200
Where did I come from?

803
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,160
Uh...

804
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Where did I come from?

805
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,500
Oh, wait.

806
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,200
I think I remember.

807
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,180
Right here.

808
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,620
I think there's another route on the screen with the three cops.

809
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,520
Three cops?

810
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,800
Excuse me, pal.

811
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,700
Love you, Mickey.

812
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,000
Thank you.

813
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,060
This screen?

814
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,040
I don't think so.

815
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,840
Doesn't seem to be the case.

816
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,900
We went downstairs and there was definitely nothing down there.

817
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,900
This way went to...

818
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh, shoot.

819
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,580
Shoot.

820
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,240
What was it?

821
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,780
Where did this go again?

822
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,040
Something about guns in the sewers.

823
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,440
Yeah, there's apparently guns in the sewers, but...

824
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,780
Okay, so this goes back to the nightclub, if I remember correctly.

825
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,700
Yes.

826
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,150
Oh, Miss Skyroom.

827
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,590
Was there a path to the ride?

828
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,650
Was there?

829
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,030
Did I miss it?

830
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,770
I'll go back and check, since I'm completely out of loss right now.

831
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,790
Completely out of loss.

832
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,030
Look all around, checkin'.

833
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:15,030
I love the green... green glow of this area.

834
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,950
It's not even just like a little bit of a green glow.

835
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,950
It's like... it's like the Simpsons green.

836
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,250
It was this one, yeah.

837
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,750
Like, this place is really infected.

838
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,360
Maybe there's like something I can touch, I don't know.

839
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,520
Radioactive, RADIOACTIVE!

840
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,740
RADIOACTIVE!

841
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,880
I'm a Blade Runner!

842
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,940
I'm lost in the game!

843
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,040
I don't know where to go!

844
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh my gosh, thank you!

845
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,460
Oh, more goo!

846
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,380
Yeah!

847
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,520
Oh yeah!

848
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,580
Good find.

849
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,640
Good eye.

850
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,500
Good eye.

851
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,600
Okay.

852
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,520
Oh.

853
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,340
Ah!

854
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,220
Oh!

855
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,920
I got...

856
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,640
I couldn't even just die to the rat house.

857
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,740
I had to fall into the goo.

858
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,580
Holy cow!

859
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,160
Okay.

860
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:37,940
Um...

861
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,120
This is the last...

862
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,540
Well, we didn't really get...

863
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,420
This is the last one that I saved though.

864
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
So we'll just do this one.

865
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,580
It's not that far.

866
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,440
Oh my gosh!

867
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,080
Oh my gosh!

868
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,600
Looney Tunes!

869
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,600
It's the insult to injury!

870
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,740
It was just terrible!

871
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,800
They're like, look, I'm rag!

872
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,660
You're getting attacked!

873
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,740
Okay.

874
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,400
Alrighty.

875
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:01,840
Alrighty.

876
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,040
Now I'm prepared.

877
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,460
I have my gun out.

878
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,880
Oh...

879
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,040
I thought this was a serious game, huh?

880
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,180
Nice.

881
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,800
I'll let your stream allow me to sleep.

882
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,160
Goodnight!

883
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:16,600
Okay!

884
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,420
Hello, Minto!

885
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,360
My G-subs Minto merch game today.

886
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,020
Thank you for ordering it!

887
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,680
Thank you, thank you!

888
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,220
That was karma for krilling the rat last stream.

889
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,240
You know what...

890
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,080
It might actually be.

891
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,160
Alright, here we go.

892
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,360
Guns out.

893
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,240
I'm ready to shoot.

894
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,040
I thought it was suspicious when...

895
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,400
He stopped on the bridge.

896
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,140
Alright, here he is.

897
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,360
Oh!

898
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,600
Dang it!

899
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,620
I...

900
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,180
Wasn't sure where he would...

901
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,520
Sorry.

902
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,200
I wasn't sure where he would stop.

903
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,740
Okay, I'm ready now.

904
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,950
Maybe I'm ready.

905
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,070
Actually, I'm kind of frightened.

906
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,450
Oh!

907
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,620
What am I supposed to do?

908
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,120
What am I supposed to do here?

909
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,100
I definitely shot the rat, though.

910
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,130
We had collabed with Camilla the other day.

911
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:37,550
It was so fun.

912
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:37,790
Oh!

913
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,970
Thanks for watching it!

914
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,650
I had a lot of fun with her.

915
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,390
Okay, hold on.

916
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,490
Die!

917
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,730
Okay, I don't think he's...

918
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,770
Maybe I run off the bridge.

919
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,250
Oh my god.

920
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,170
Oh, okay.

921
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,550
Alright.

922
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:01,690
Run!

923
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:01,970
Oh!

924
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,850
I like how he just kind of shows up.

925
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,630
Oh!

926
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,790
I have to wait.

927
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,170
Hold on.

928
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,150
I'll wait for him to chase me.

929
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,390
Oh!

930
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,820
Okay, it's not possible.

931
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,900
Huh...

932
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
The hell am I supposed to do here?

933
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,760
Does he want pizza?

934
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,380
Is this truly my karma?

935
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,860
Rat, too.

936
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,120
I mean, that is a really big rat, so...

937
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,280
Okay, hold on.

938
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,640
Look, you sound lively.

939
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Did something good happen?

940
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,600
I shouldn't sound lively.

941
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,140
I'm dead.

942
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,040
But...

943
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,960
No, nothing...

944
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,740
Nothing particular.

945
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,220
Hmm...

946
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,040
Maybe I...

947
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,140
Run past the rat.

948
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,910
What...

949
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,650
What would a rat want besides cheese?

950
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,650
I don't know where to get any cheese.

951
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,520
Maybe...

952
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,080
Okay, hold on.

953
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,440
Maybe I don't...

954
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,240
You know, like, maybe I don't...

955
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,540
Leave, I...

956
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:04,980
Hold on.

957
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,840
Um...

958
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,140
You sound deadly.

959
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,060
Something good happen.

960
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,820
Wait!

961
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,000
I do have cheese!

962
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,360
Remember?

963
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,220
Wait, I have some cheese...

964
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,040
I have cheese!

965
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,140
Wait!

966
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,980
I actually have cheese!

967
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,960
Wait, how do I give this to him?

968
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,960
How do I give him the cheese?

969
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,520
Okay, hold on.

970
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,960
Maybe I don't...

971
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,820
Ugh, this is gonna be tough.

972
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,160
I'm gonna click on him instead.

973
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,560
Cheese!

974
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,780
This is so stupid!

975
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,620
Hold on, I'm going to my walkthrough.

976
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,200
I'm gonna look up rat.

977
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,740
Rat.

978
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,220
Rat.

979
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
Okay, one out of sixteen.

980
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,360
Rat.

981
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,700
Rat.

982
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,040
Rat.

983
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
Give me a hug, rat.

984
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,780
Okay.

985
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,340
From now on, wander the sewers with your gun drawn, because rats will be lurking and they kill you!

986
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,540
Wait!

987
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,920
Okay!

988
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,980
Rat's bridge!

989
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,340
It's literally called that!

990
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,220
Halfway across the bridge, a huge rat will approach.

991
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,880
If you shoot the rat on the bridge, his weight will make the board crack.

992
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,360
And it's death for you.

993
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,460
I found the easiest way to kill the vermin is to walk slowly down the bridge.

994
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,640
Gun drawn.

995
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,480
When you freeze, it means he's about to appear, so quickly run off the plank to the side.

996
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,500
When the rat follows, wait until he's not touching the board, then put a bullet in him.

997
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:44,980
What?!

998
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,400
I saw I really...

999
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,860
Okay.

1000
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,880
Gun drawn!

1001
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,900
So maybe I, like, come over here, you know?

1002
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,040
Okay.

1003
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,180
Alright, alright, alright.

1004
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,900
Go.

1005
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,260
McCoy, walk.

1006
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,380
McCoy, walk over here.

1007
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,820
Can I walk with my gun out?

1008
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,360
Yes, I can.

1009
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:08,600
Okay.

1010
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,580
Walk.

1011
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,320
Walk.

1012
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,200
Walk.

1013
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,140
Walk.

1014
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,640
Okay, I have to do this.

1015
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,480
Now run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1016
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,560
Whoa!

1017
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,980
Yeah, we took care of that sucker!

1018
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:26,860
Yes!

1019
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,740
First try?

1020
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,700
Just a moment of your time, please.

1021
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,200
I am sick and tired of people waving those things around.

1022
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,160
Just give it up.

1023
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,120
You got no jurisdiction down here.

1024
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,980
What's the twins?

1025
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,780
No, no, we tried that already.

1026
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:52,440
Look, we know that the adenine thymine and guanine cytosine sequences can be mutated in progress.

1027
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,160
Let's move on.

1028
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,100
Hey, it's about time you showed up.

1029
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,100
Hey!

1030
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,320
Do you know who I am?

1031
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,400
Do you know who I am?

1032
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,440
Detective Ray McCoy.

1033
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,160
Ask me.

1034
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,340
You're investigating Miraji's death.

1035
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,260
And Eisenduller's.

1036
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,140
Having any luck?

1037
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,900
You're Luther and Lance?

1038
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,200
Hell of a smart cookie there.

1039
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,280
Take your guns and your violence elsewhere.

1040
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,420
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have had my gun drawn.

1041
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,240
Are you angry at me?

1042
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,080
Sorry.

1043
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,740
No, no, no.

1044
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,220
I don't have my gun drawn.

1045
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,300
Uh...

1046
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,360
I thought that said pizza.

1047
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,600
Congrats on beating possibly the hardest boss in the game!

1048
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,600
Are they conjoined?

1049
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,480
Yeah, they are.

1050
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,780
Let's ask about...

1051
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,020
What was that?

1052
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,560
Clovis set me up, didn't he?

1053
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,280
And he used my boss to do it.

1054
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,040
He's sharp this one.

1055
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,540
No question.

1056
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:43,620
No question.

1057
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,460
Tell me what you know.

1058
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,000
How about we trade?

1059
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,120
Our life for yours.

1060
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,640
Wait, what?

1061
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,580
Keep talking.

1062
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,640
Clovis has gone to see Elden.

1063
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,160
But he might not make it.

1064
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,660
Still, the work will go on, with or without Clovis.

1065
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,560
Clovis.

1066
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,760
Get us Tyrell's files, the rest of the DNA data, and we'll help you.

1067
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,220
You want me to break into the Tyrell building for you?

1068
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,660
You're nuts.

1069
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,380
Defective, yes.

1070
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,420
Nuts, no.

1071
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,460
You need us, McCoy.

1072
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,260
We can serve up Guza's carcass on a big oversized platter.

1073
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,980
We have to break into the Tyrell building?

1074
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,540
Exciting.

1075
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,620
Wait, who's that?

1076
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,980
Ooh, a baby should be in that pod.

1077
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,340
I like how we're just...

1078
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,660
Are they gonna invite us in, or...?

1079
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,540
Um, replicates.

1080
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,300
The reps that killed Marcus and Miraji, they'll be looking for you.

1081
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,020
You're a little late, detective.

1082
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,860
They've already found us.

1083
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,920
So why are you still walking around?

1084
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,980
Cause we're all part of the same pseudocards, you know what I mean?

1085
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,660
Oh?

1086
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:52,140
Well, Elden makes mistakes just like any other... human.

1087
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,900
The difference is...

1088
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,260
The difference is, your bastard doesn't like to admit it.

1089
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:05,760
No, he covers them up, pretends they're human, gives them a job at a stinking corporation, and then when they actually produce original work, he boots them out on the street.

1090
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,860
You're saying... you're replicants?

1091
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,380
We finally figured it out.

1092
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,020
Clovis helped us see the light.

1093
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,740
But that's ridiculous.

1094
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,140
Hyrule wouldn't design something like you.

1095
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,560
Damn!

1096
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,240
That's perfection.

1097
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,840
I told you we were a mistake.

1098
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,580
No!

1099
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,760
Keep talking.

1100
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,300
Sometimes our memories are... different from each other's.

1101
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,260
The implant process isn't perfect.

1102
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,960
We know, we've seen the studies.

1103
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,740
You can't always be sure exactly how the memories will play out in the subject's mind.

1104
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,700
We're totally a replicant.

1105
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,960
We've got different recollections of our childhood.

1106
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,920
Explain that.

1107
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,260
Maybe one of you just forgot.

1108
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,360
If you can't trust your own memories, what's left that makes you human?

1109
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,980
Maggie!

1110
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:58,080
Because our own apartment wasn't even... wasn't even right... I don't know.

1111
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,380
Oh, gosh.

1112
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,240
There's a lot here.

1113
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:01,620
Okay.

1114
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,420
There's so many... hold on.

1115
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:04,900
Wait.

1116
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:05,880
Okay, I'll just ask him.

1117
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,940
What are you doing down here?

1118
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,320
Elden shafted us, so now we're returning the favor.

1119
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,100
We promised Clovis we'd be finished with this by the time he got back, so if you don't mind...

1120
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:16,500
Okay.

1121
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,380
Oh, that's not what I meant to say.

1122
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,460
Um...

1123
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,400
So this is Sadiq.

1124
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,700
That's us.

1125
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,520
Izo.

1126
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,220
Lucy.

1127
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,040
That is Clovis.

1128
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,660
That's the big bad guy that we've been after.

1129
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:31,940
I guess... what was it?

1130
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,480
Mr. Eldon Ring.

1131
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,040
He is the guy at Tyrell.

1132
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,920
I guess he's like the big baddie at Tyrell.

1133
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,560
Our apartment did say McCoy.

1134
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,220
It did.

1135
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,200
It did.

1136
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,140
Nobody tell them how memory is malleable.

1137
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:04,340
Yeah, no one tell them how eyewitnesses are so inaccurate so many times because they just forget everything.

1138
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,460
They remember what they want to remember.

1139
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:08,980
Lifespan.

1140
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,880
Tyrell says the four year lifespan can't be extended.

1141
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,600
Of course he's gonna say that, but he's wrong.

1142
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,300
Very wrong.

1143
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,360
We got the research right here that'll prove it.

1144
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,540
Wait, so if I had a digital girlfriend, she would...

1145
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,880
Could you extend the life of a replicant right now?

1146
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,100
Well, no.

1147
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,820
If I had a replicant girlfriend, she would only last four years?

1148
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,020
The four year limit is an integral part of every element of the replicant.

1149
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:37,840
Tyrell's dictate was that every body part would fail, and only the designers of each would know exactly how it worked.

1150
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,880
Clovis has already unlocked a secret of the skin.

1151
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,760
That was Miraji.

1152
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,440
Sebastian and Chu, they'd know about the central nervous system in the eyes.

1153
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,860
A lot of retrograde viruses were built into the eyes.

1154
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,020
And Tyrell, he's got the basic DNA pattern information, but he won't just give it up.

1155
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,280
Did you tell Clovis all this?

1156
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,640
He didn't ask.

1157
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,380
He already knew.

1158
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,880
He knows all about you, too.

1159
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,040
Does he like me?

1160
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,880
I think that doesn't know.

1161
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,760
Chu.

1162
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,680
Chu was that one Chinese guy that was in the ice cube.

1163
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,680
Yeah, I remember him.

1164
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,360
He was right before the guy.

1165
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,880
Minto, are you the real McCoy?

1166
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,420
I don't know anymore!

1167
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,440
Clovis.

1168
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,540
Where's Clovis now?

1169
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,840
Gone to have a little heart-to-heart with Elden.

1170
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:29,940
Elden Ring.

1171
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,700
He'll kill Tyrell if he gets to him.

1172
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,920
Isn't that just too bad?

1173
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,720
Oh, Tyrell's the big guy.

1174
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,360
I won't shed any tears.

1175
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,640
Tyrell is killing us all.

1176
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,680
Is it Tyrell or Tyrell?

1177
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,600
Please pick one.

1178
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,360
Four years isn't enough, is it?

1179
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,180
If Clovis snaps his neck, it'll be merciful and quick.

1180
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,460
That's a hell of a lot more than we've been given.

1181
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:50,930
Elden Ring.

1182
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,250
That's...

1183
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,170
Oh my gosh, wait.

1184
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:56,610
Elden.

1185
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:57,910
The Dawn.

1186
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:00,850
Oh my gosh.

1187
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,810
Is Elden Ring about... gangsters?

1188
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,350
The Dawn.

1189
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,670
Elden Ring.

1190
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,690
I got a little test I want you to take.

1191
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,250
You believe this clown?

1192
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,770
He wants to Voight Confess.

1193
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:22,430
Oh!

1194
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,730
Oh, I completely... I forget what this is every time.

1195
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:24,750
Sorry, McCoy.

1196
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,950
Shoot us or leave us alone.

1197
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,070
I forget what the Voight...

1198
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:27,850
Let's get back to work.

1199
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,310
I forget what that is every time.

1200
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,870
What kind of deal did you have going with Runciter?

1201
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:33,750
Don't talk to me about it.

1202
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,510
That was Lance's stupid deal.

1203
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,910
We just wanted to make some extra cash on the side.

1204
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:42,230
We only got to do that one time, but it was kind of...

1205
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,730
I'm sure he wasn't too pleased.

1206
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,970
I didn't understand it at all.

1207
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,170
Since Elden is such a pain in the ass control freak.

1208
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:49,150
Elden Ring.

1209
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,570
Did you meet Clovis through Runciter?

1210
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,430
It was all just a coincidence.

1211
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,090
They are really chill.

1212
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:55,890
I like them.

1213
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,250
Okay, I'm gonna save here so we don't have to go through all the dialogue again.

1214
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,170
Makeshift bridge.

1215
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,950
No, that was the rat bridge.

1216
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:04,710
Okay.

1217
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,110
And then we have...

1218
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:06,250
Oh!

1219
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,150
We can go up or we can go in.

1220
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,690
Let's go in.

1221
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,110
Oh!

1222
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,630
Wow!

1223
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:11,990
Oh!

1224
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,350
And we can go up.

1225
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,650
We are so great.

1226
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,510
I don't feel so good.

1227
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,610
What's up here?

1228
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:27,710
Rude but chill.

1229
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:28,170
Oh!

1230
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:28,750
They're gone!

1231
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,670
They were in the Matrix.

1232
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,530
This is where we are!

1233
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,650
And so this is where Chew is.

1234
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,490
Phil, thank you so much for the five gifted.

1235
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:43,190
Thank you.

1236
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,030
This was where the explosion happened.

1237
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,450
Wait, can we even...

1238
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,950
There's probably nothing in here.

1239
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:55,410
Wait.

1240
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:56,630
It was green.

1241
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:57,590
For a moment.

1242
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:58,170
Locked.

1243
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,350
No way through here.

1244
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,890
I don't think that's locked.

1245
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,250
I think that's exploded.

1246
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,250
And then from here, we can get to, um...

1247
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:11,910
Oh, the puppet man?

1248
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,190
Is my car here?

1249
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:14,670
No.

1250
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,990
I think my car is gone.

1251
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,750
My car is...

1252
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,330
Done-zo.

1253
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:21,890
Locked.

1254
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,270
Wait, really?

1255
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,690
We can't go see Chew either?

1256
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:25,830
There?

1257
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:26,670
This is where the...

1258
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,290
The puppet man is.

1259
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,990
And, um...

1260
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,660
Yes.

1261
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,840
There was something too.

1262
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,880
Something down here, no?

1263
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,880
What was down here?

1264
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:53,610
Wait...

1265
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,090
Oh my god!

1266
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,790
That's the...

1267
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,970
That's the sushi place in the hotel.

1268
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:04,070
Apartment?

1269
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,490
I keep calling it a hotel.

1270
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:06,890
It's probably an apartment complex.

1271
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:11,670
Okay.

1272
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:12,730
Now we have...

1273
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,210
To go up those one stairs.

1274
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,890
That ladder.

1275
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,010
Everything is looping.

1276
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:19,550
Oh, they're back!

1277
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:20,530
Stick around.

1278
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,890
I may not be finished with you.

1279
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,770
They're like, Shut the hell up, McCoy.

1280
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:25,330
We don't care.

1281
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:26,970
In here.

1282
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,460
What?

1283
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:35,540
What?

1284
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,100
Huh?

1285
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:41,690
Whoa.

1286
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:43,590
No, no.

1287
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:44,790
Wait, huh?

1288
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,430
All of this is right here?

1289
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,170
Okay, we go here.

1290
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,490
We're teeny tiny.

1291
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,610
We're gonna be crawling through the vents?

1292
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:57,670
What are we doing?

1293
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,410
No!

1294
00:53:58,890 --> 00:53:58,970
Oh!

1295
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,910
Oh, it's a sneaky mission.

1296
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,000
We just snuck into Tyrell.

1297
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,040
I'm gonna...

1298
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,960
Kill that guy.

1299
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,120
Wait...

1300
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,830
Oh, I can't.

1301
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,910
Come on!

1302
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,360
Oh!

1303
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:28,720
Hey, yo!

1304
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,240
Stop!

1305
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,520
Oh!

1306
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,780
I got the achievement.

1307
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,560
Not so coy after all.

1308
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,440
Get thrown in jail.

1309
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,300
Hey, you!

1310
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:46,960
Stop!

1311
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,060
Come on, let me kill him.

1312
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,500
Let me kill him.

1313
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,290
He's right there!

1314
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,950
What if I just...

1315
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,630
Go.

1316
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:10,750
Oh!

1317
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,850
It worked!

1318
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,460
What is that?

1319
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:18,840
A phone?

1320
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,780
Why are we in Egypt?

1321
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,280
All of a sudden...

1322
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,200
What are these wind chimes?

1323
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:27,900
Hello?

1324
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,360
I'm so sneaky, you guys.

1325
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,780
Oh.

1326
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,700
I got something.

1327
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,580
What did I get?

1328
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,680
I don't know.

1329
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,800
Not the answering machine.

1330
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:51,080
Oh!

1331
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,000
I got the DNA!

1332
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,060
We got the Tyrell DNA!

1333
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,200
We can just leave.

1334
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,580
I'm sleepy.

1335
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,940
Can we do Blade Runner?

1336
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,920
Watch a log sometime.

1337
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,240
Yeah, that would be fun!

1338
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,860
Tyrell really sucks at his job.

1339
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,300
This was too easy, you know?

1340
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,100
Uh,

1341
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,340
bye!

1342
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
I got what she wanted.

1343
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,640
No boxes required.

1344
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,180
Yeah, give me Guza!

1345
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,100
Your boss is a real piece of work, let me tell you.

1346
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,420
Almost as good as Tyrell.

1347
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,800
Let's take a look.

1348
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,280
That probably had something to do with you guys getting fired.

1349
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,280
Guza had his fingers in as many rancid pies as possible.

1350
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:55,960
He was insatiable.

1351
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,200
He sold police equipment, ripped off criminals, and he even killed.

1352
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,440
And here were documents that proved it all.

1353
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:02,820
Oh my god!

1354
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,540
Depositions, photographs, video discs.

1355
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:05,860
Wow!

1356
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,160
It was the complete file on Guza, the dirty cop.

1357
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,320
Where'd you get this?

1358
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,600
From Clovis.

1359
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,200
He told us to hold it for him.

1360
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:13,660
Oh.

1361
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,380
Come to think of it, I'm not sure you're supposed to see it.

1362
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,440
You wanna give it back now?

1363
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,100
No.

1364
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:18,940
Not a chance.

1365
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,380
Let him have it.

1366
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,640
Clovis said he was finished with the policeman anyway.

1367
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,300
A little light started to flicker in my brain.

1368
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,920
Guza was the one measuring me for the frame.

1369
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,280
Oh.

1370
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,520
When my stomach stopped churning, I realized I had everything I needed to force the bastard to play ball with me.

1371
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,860
I knew that he would listen to reason, if applied with serious pressure.

1372
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,940
All I needed to do was call him.

1373
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,440
The guy?

1374
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,920
Do I have his number, or...?

1375
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,320
Surely in 2019 we had cell phones, no?

1376
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,220
Save?

1377
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,560
Oh yeah, don't you worry, I am.

1378
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,380
I'm kind of curious to go back to the Tyrell building.

1379
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,000
It was...

1380
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,720
It was too easy.

1381
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,820
Okay, um...

1382
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,260
Stick around.

1383
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,620
I may not be finished with you.

1384
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,780
Okay, uh...

1385
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,220
Where did the...

1386
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,140
Oh, this went this way.

1387
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,580
Alright, we gotta go find him.

1388
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,960
I remember...

1389
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,260
Fighting him in...

1390
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,340
It was like...

1391
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,420
Oh, I remember as a kid...

1392
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,220
Maybe it was the police station you fight him.

1393
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:21,960
I don't know.

1394
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,060
How do I get back to there?

1395
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,580
This thing is gonna laugh at us.

1396
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,420
So creepy.

1397
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,320
Wasn't there a phone here?

1398
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,000
Was there?

1399
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,240
There's a phone here...

1400
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,280
Oh, you're right!

1401
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,540
There is a phone in here!

1402
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,740
Yeah, cause we had the answering machine!

1403
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,120
Huh?

1404
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,700
I don't understand your super chat, but thank you!

1405
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,840
I've gotten all I can from that.

1406
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,380
Wait, no, that's the phone...

1407
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,080
That's the...

1408
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,420
Maybe here?

1409
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,100
Oh!

1410
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,380
Yeah?

1411
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,760
Been messing with people's lives lately?

1412
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,020
McCoy!

1413
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,260
Where the hell you been?

1414
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,660
We've been looking all over for you.

1415
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:13,840
Yeah?

1416
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,320
Am I wanted dead or alive?

1417
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,940
You don't know what you are, kid.

1418
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,420
You can sell that replicant shit to everybody else, but I ain't buying.

1419
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,200
If you're so clean, let's put you on the machine.

1420
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,140
That'll decide once and for all.

1421
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,860
I'm through listening, Guza.

1422
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,680
Now it's your turn.

1423
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,280
I've been doing some investigating on my own.

1424
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,920
Came across some prime sources.

1425
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,520
You know what I'm talking about.

1426
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,880
Those little illegal weapons deals with Izo.

1427
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,480
Izo!

1428
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,720
You were raking in the chinions, selling LPD wares to scumbags and reps.

1429
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:43,820
Oh, yeah.

1430
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,940
The department's gonna eat it up when they hear just how deep that corruption goes.

1431
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,880
That's a load of crap.

1432
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:50,660
Crap.

1433
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,640
Let's hope for your sake, Bryant and the brass field that way, when I lay this file on them.

1434
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,580
Otherwise, it's a one-way ticket to the off-world penal colony, fat man.

1435
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,320
What do you want, McCoy?

1436
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,780
Remove the frame, clear my name, and get that guy out of my apartment.

1437
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,560
I want my life back.

1438
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,180
I can't do that.

1439
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,360
You better start finding a way, cause I got another call to make.

1440
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,620
Okay, okay.

1441
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,960
How do we work this out?

1442
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,740
We can't talk over the damn phone.

1443
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,100
The sewers.

1444
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,200
The sewers!

1445
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,640
I know you want to be comfortable, and I figure it's kind of like your second home down there.

1446
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:24,960
I'm calling him a rat.

1447
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,500
From the bottom of the old elevator, there's a gate.

1448
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,160
Past it, there's a chamber.

1449
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,500
It's got a round platform.

1450
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,780
Oh, yes, yes.

1451
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,020
Yeah, I know it.

1452
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,400
Be there, alone.

1453
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,480
And you better hold up your end, or Bryant gets it all.

1454
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:44,640
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1455
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,120
I...

1456
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,020
Stick around.

1457
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,380
I may not be finished with you.

1458
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,540
I like the way he points at them really dramatically.

1459
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:53,680
Alright.

1460
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,660
We're gonna go through here.

1461
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,640
I will save...

1462
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,340
Here.

1463
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:00,820
Okay.

1464
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:01,640
Save?

1465
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:05,520
Um...

1466
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,680
I'm gonna do a new one.

1467
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:07,920
New, new.

1468
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,900
Okay, here we go!

1469
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,180
I'm gonna get my gun out.

1470
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,680
I'm going in.

1471
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,240
Luckily this was, like, so close.

1472
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,740
Oh my god!

1473
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,960
He's actually there!

1474
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:22,940
Fat man!

1475
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,560
Did you get that asshole out of my apartment?

1476
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,800
It's cleaner than when you left it.

1477
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,060
My dog?

1478
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,140
The Maggie?

1479
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,120
Yeah.

1480
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,020
Yeah, yeah, your pooch is there too.

1481
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,470
Is that everything I need to clear me?

1482
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,210
I gotta tell you, kid.

1483
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,470
Those inset photos look pretty real.

1484
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,350
Let me guess.

1485
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:51,570
Clovis gave them to you.

1486
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,770
It must seem pretty gullible, but he sounded on a level.

1487
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,770
Did he photoshop me?

1488
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:58,670
She called you his brother.

1489
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,250
Said you came down to the moon bus with all of them.

1490
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,190
We're right at the moon bus!

1491
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,870
He said Tyrell was using you to get inside the LPD.

1492
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,230
Oh...

1493
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,010
You hadn't been on the job too long, so I thought...

1494
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:10,470
Maybe.

1495
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:12,550
Oh...

1496
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,870
You'd screw with my head?

1497
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:14,710
How convenient.

1498
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:18,150
You could satisfy your blackmailer.

1499
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,630
And keep me from sniffing around your dirty work at the same time.

1500
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:25,870
You're too smart for me, kid.

1501
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,490
Water under the bridge.

1502
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:28,850
You ready to talk trade?

1503
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:32,770
Don't get closer!

1504
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:33,610
What are you doing?

1505
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,030
I got it all right here.

1506
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,010
Photos, files, discs, the work.

1507
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,170
It ain't a pretty sight.

1508
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,790
You can't blame a guy for trying to better himself.

1509
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,510
He's gonna throw us into the goo!

1510
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,130
Trying is one thing.

1511
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,810
Ripping off speed loaders and selling the shit yourself.

1512
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,990
Farming out LPD weapons through black marketeers.

1513
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:00,070
Torching two pimps who wouldn't pay you off when you were working vice.

1514
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:00,110
Thanks.

1515
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,770
Hey, those two had it coming.

1516
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:05,290
You're recording all this, right McCoy?

1517
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:07,190
How long did you think it could last?

1518
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:07,870
You're recording?

1519
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,310
Yeah, you're getting like evidence.

1520
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:12,810
It finally reaches the point where you don't even think about what happened yesterday.

1521
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,670
This does feel like a trap, yeah.

1522
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,370
Only what's coming to you tomorrow.

1523
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,070
I'm nervous.

1524
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,810
20 years in the job, kid.

1525
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,830
And nobody was gonna touch me.

1526
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,370
Helping reps also part of the job?

1527
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:26,230
Mm-hmm.

1528
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:30,150
I was gonna whack them myself once the heat was off.

1529
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:31,910
Tie up those loose ends.

1530
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,450
Once I was out of the way.

1531
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,650
Clovis is still gonna come gunning for me, kid.

1532
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,090
You and Chris gotta take him down.

1533
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,970
Then my problems are over.

1534
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,950
Our problems are over.

1535
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:51,370
And we can all live happily ever after.

1536
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:52,150
Clovis.

1537
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:55,890
Stop walking towards him!

1538
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,310
He's gonna push us into the...

1539
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:57,470
I don't know.

1540
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,370
A lot has changed.

1541
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:58,810
Oh my god.

1542
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:58,830
Oh my god.

1543
01:03:58,830 --> 01:03:59,570
I don't know what I want.

1544
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:00,530
McCoy, please!

1545
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,570
That's fine, kid.

1546
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:03,530
Just walk away.

1547
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,150
I knew you didn't have the cojones.

1548
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,430
Hey, I got you where I want you, don't I?

1549
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,430
Kid, I'm what they call a survivor.

1550
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:16,290
I'm a survivor!

1551
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:19,210
You're sick as sludge of hell and live to tell the tale.

1552
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:20,910
Now we can tell.

1553
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,450
I'll be around long after they've forgotten that you were ever on the job.

1554
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:27,150
Wouldn't bet on it.

1555
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,110
But I'm tired, kid.

1556
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:31,930
I'm ready to turn over a new leaf.

1557
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,150
I swear to you, everything will be different if we just stick together.

1558
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:38,150
And knock the team out.

1559
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:39,190
Oh.

1560
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,270
Come on.

1561
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,670
What do you say?

1562
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,630
I see we were right to follow him, Sadiq.

1563
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:47,330
Oh my god, it's Clovis!

1564
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,330
Looks that way, man.

1565
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,470
Wait, where are they?

1566
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,130
Oh, shoot.

1567
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,850
You might as well give it up, Clovis.

1568
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,210
You and your people don't have a chance.

1569
01:04:58,610 --> 01:04:59,070
Hold on.

1570
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:00,390
Save.

1571
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:02,550
What if I shoot him right now?

1572
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,590
That'd be crazy, though.

1573
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,930
We stand a greater chance of success than you, Lieutenant.

1574
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:15,390
McCoy and I were just talking about how to get you guys out of your jam.

1575
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,110
What if I shoot him right now?

1576
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,350
We came up with a plan.

1577
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,310
But you gotta show yourself first.

1578
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,510
We gotta do this in person.

1579
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,130
Who the hell do you think you're kidding, McCoy?

1580
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:25,950
Give it a try!

1581
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,050
Oh, damn!

1582
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:32,900
The hunter?

1583
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,940
Do us a favor, man.

1584
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:36,840
He bagged us a trick.

1585
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:37,360
Do it!

1586
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,260
Brother, you killed a human.

1587
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:42,700
Brother!

1588
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,420
Come out and show yourself!

1589
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,180
First things first.

1590
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,640
You must decide where you belong, brother.

1591
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,000
Are we deciding with the replicates?

1592
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,780
Oh my god!

1593
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,300
You've wasted much time already.

1594
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:05,400
No more choices, Ray McCoy.

1595
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,180
Well, let me move around.

1596
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,260
Meet us at the moon bus.

1597
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,480
Together we will face the tiger that waits in the night's forest.

1598
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,180
Brother!

1599
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,060
I saw that one guy run down here.

1600
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,140
Wait, I don't know how to get to the moon bus.

1601
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,060
Can you give me the directions, please?

1602
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:27,510
Hey.

1603
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,190
Anybody know about a moon bus?

1604
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:32,730
You?

1605
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:33,770
You?

1606
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:34,870
You know about a moon bus?

1607
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,030
Let me ask you something.

1608
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,330
Yeah, about a moon bus.

1609
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:37,690
Damn.

1610
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:38,670
Never mind.

1611
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:40,790
Oh.

1612
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,090
Moon bus.

1613
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:46,830
The arcade?

1614
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:50,170
I haven't figured out how to get back there.

1615
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,150
I'm not gonna lie.

1616
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:00,530
Huh.

1617
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,680
I always wanted a brother.

1618
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,100
I always wanted a brother.

1619
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,020
I haven't thought about that in a hot minute.

1620
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,000
Wasn't it past the nightclub?

1621
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,900
Ah!

1622
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:17,940
Ah!

1623
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:18,500
Ah!

1624
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:18,540
Ah!

1625
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:18,880
Oh, sorry.

1626
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,780
I can't get out!

1627
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,040
Ah!

1628
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:26,540
Ah!

1629
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:27,960
Ah!

1630
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,200
Ah!

1631
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:30,780
Ah!

1632
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:33,800
Ah!

1633
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,020
Ah!

1634
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:34,920
Ah!

1635
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,260
Where are you at?

1636
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,800
Why do they always disappear?

1637
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,340
Where?

1638
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:43,740
Oh my god.

1639
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,100
Oh!

1640
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:44,700
There he comes!

1641
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:45,740
He was right there!

1642
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,580
Coming for me!

1643
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,880
Did you see that?

1644
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,680
He was coming up behind me!

1645
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,160
Holy cow!

1646
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,400
The sewers come out.

1647
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,960
Okay, this is...

1648
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,580
Where is this?

1649
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,460
I actually have no idea.

1650
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,580
They're out for blood.

1651
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,730
This is...

1652
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:15,150
Um...

1653
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:15,750
Okay.

1654
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,290
I know where this is.

1655
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:18,950
Now we go back in here.

1656
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,280
Oh, hi girl.

1657
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,680
Yeah, that was Izo's place.

1658
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,000
I'm trying to...

1659
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,600
Okay.

1660
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,900
I'm trying to...

1661
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,760
Go back...

1662
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,440
Maybe...

1663
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,600
To the nightclub.

1664
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,500
Maybe it was this one.

1665
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,620
If we can get to the arcade from the nightclub.

1666
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,500
I haven't been able to figure out how.

1667
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:47,660
Ah!

1668
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1669
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:49,940
Okay.

1670
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:51,460
Yes.

1671
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,880
Anybody know where a moon bus is?

1672
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,800
Wait, what was this way?

1673
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,080
I don't remember.

1674
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:05,630
There was one sewers that we could get to the car shop.

1675
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:06,550
I thought...

1676
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:09,110
Oh my gosh, what a run.

1677
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:10,410
Ah!

1678
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:11,550
Yes!

1679
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:12,030
This...

1680
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:12,510
Okay, wait.

1681
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,790
This does go back to the arcade.

1682
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:15,210
It was right here, right here.

1683
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,670
Actually, can I go further down?

1684
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:18,950
To the moon bus?

1685
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,380
No.

1686
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,860
No moon bus.

1687
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,570
I've been trying to find this place the whole time.

1688
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,470
And yet...

1689
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,510
Here we are.

1690
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,330
We found it.

1691
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,590
Thank you, guys.

1692
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:42,770
I want to see if Lucy is back here because I scared her off before.

1693
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:44,730
Fight the rat.

1694
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:45,150
No!

1695
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,110
Oh my gosh.

1696
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:50,710
Crazy.

1697
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:52,510
Okay, in here.

1698
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,090
Hysteria Hall.

1699
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,210
No!

1700
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,110
She's still not here!

1701
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,870
This might be a mistake.

1702
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,290
Okay, it was a mistake.

1703
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,620
I'm trying to find the moon bus.

1704
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,260
I have no idea where it is.

1705
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,280
If I run around in circles.

1706
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:28,620
I will just lose my head.

1707
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,120
Where's the moon bus?

1708
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,060
Where's the moon bus?

1709
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,880
Where's the moon bus?

1710
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,560
Where's the moon bus?

1711
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,660
Where's the moon bus?

1712
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,210
Where's the moon bus?

1713
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,110
Where's the moon bus?

1714
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:42,150
Where's the moon bus?

1715
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,250
Where's the moon bus?

1716
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,550
Where's the moon bus?

1717
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:46,890
Where's the moon bus?

1718
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:46,990
Where's the moon bus?

1719
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:47,150
Where's the moon bus?

1720
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:47,470
Where's the moon bus?

1721
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:48,210
Where's the moon bus?

1722
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:04,500
Where's the moon bus?

1723
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,400
Where's the

1724
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:17,910
moon bus?

1725
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,390
Where's the moon bus?

1726
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:23,010
Okay.

1727
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:28,550
Lead runner... What?

1728
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:32,110
Actually, no, I'm gonna... I'm just gonna lose my computer.

1729
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:32,850
Where?

1730
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:33,910
Yeah, instead of my phone.

1731
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:35,010
Hi, da.

1732
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,390
Huh?

1733
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,170
Run back to my apartment.

1734
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:49,710
Oh, wait.

1735
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,670
I have to go back to my apartment?

1736
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,470
But this is the bird bus.

1737
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,850
That's what the walkthrough says, at least.

1738
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,030
Start act five.

1739
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,630
I thought we were on act three.

1740
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:06,270
What did we turn to act four?

1741
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:14,130
But Maggie... Yeah, maybe we gotta go back because he was just like, yeah, your dog's there.

1742
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:15,990
Yeah, everything.

1743
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:17,590
Can we take a car?

1744
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,510
That would be really nice, right?

1745
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,970
I... I'm

1746
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,380
gonna see if I can steal a car.

1747
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,620
Car, then we can go everywhere so... so much more quickly.

1748
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,560
I think act four started when he got framed.

1749
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,140
Oh, okay.

1750
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,480
Howdy doody.

1751
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,000
Let's go.

1752
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:48,040
Take this one.

1753
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,780
That sucks.

1754
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,000
No, it doesn't.

1755
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,460
Please.

1756
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,140
Locked.

1757
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:55,180
Locked.

1758
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,240
Please, it doesn't matter what it looks like.

1759
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:58,860
Locked.

1760
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,640
No, maybe we can talk to him and say, hey, my car.

1761
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:04,240
Please, mister.

1762
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,500
I hope you get paperwork for all these vehicles.

1763
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,980
Are we kids or what, Ray?

1764
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,940
You're talking to crazy li- I take- You can take- Okay.

1765
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,060
I keep your paws off that, Ray.

1766
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,760
He sounds so disappointed in me.

1767
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,180
I don't want to disappoint him.

1768
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,560
Oh, we're going downstairs.

1769
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,520
Do you think he's rotoscope?

1770
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,160
I feel like the movement is so smooth, you know?

1771
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,420
Why is he being picky all of a sudden?

1772
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,960
This one's eggy.

1773
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:42,660
I don't want it.

1774
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,200
Oh, now I have to remember how to get to my apartment.

1775
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,200
I don't remember which part of the sewers it was.

1776
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:49,520
Oh, my gosh.

1777
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:50,980
Bye.

1778
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:53,640
Okay.

1779
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:58,270
Mocap?

1780
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:58,950
Oh, that's what I meant.

1781
01:13:59,210 --> 01:13:59,410
Sorry.

1782
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:00,310
I said rotoscope.

1783
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,130
I'm on mocap.

1784
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:01,470
Yeah.

1785
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:15,890
Which way?

1786
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:16,930
Okay.

1787
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:17,850
This is to Izo.

1788
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:22,550
This is to Sushi.

1789
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,970
And to where we shot the guy.

1790
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:33,470
This game did use motion capture.

1791
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:33,930
So, yeah.

1792
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:35,210
That makes sense.

1793
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:37,090
Wait.

1794
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:38,770
I thought I saw a rat.

1795
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:42,370
This one was...

1796
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:43,610
I don't remember.

1797
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:44,550
Let's go this way first.

1798
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:49,690
I think rotoscope makes more sense for the time period.

1799
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:51,430
Did they even have motion capture back then?

1800
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:52,070
I'm sure.

1801
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:55,770
Where does this go?

1802
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:58,710
Tough day, McCoy.

1803
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,610
You could say that.

1804
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,570
Steel is looking for you.

1805
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:03,630
And Bryant.

1806
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,850
You've been keeping the whole department hopping.

1807
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:07,950
You and Guza.

1808
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:08,670
Guza.

1809
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:09,150
I know.

1810
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,170
You looking for me too, Gaff?

1811
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:12,290
Looking.

1812
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:13,590
Not killing.

1813
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,690
I'm in a good mood today.

1814
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:16,230
Oh.

1815
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,470
You know you got some interesting neighbors, McCoy.

1816
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:21,990
Oh?

1817
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,150
Yeah, well.

1818
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:25,070
I've been too busy to visit lately.

1819
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,170
You're going to turn yourself in?

1820
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,030
Hell no.

1821
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,490
I'm thinking about it.

1822
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,950
Wait, what?

1823
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:30,670
Think hard.

1824
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:31,050
Ah!

1825
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,610
He's coming up on me!

1826
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:33,350
You killed anyone yet?

1827
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:34,090
No.

1828
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:35,950
It's like I said before.

1829
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,830
You retire a human, your career is over.

1830
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,310
Wait, wait, wait.

1831
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:40,950
Your life too, maybe.

1832
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:41,770
No, no, no.

1833
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,710
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1834
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:43,890
Wait, wait.

1835
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:44,910
I can't do anything.

1836
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:45,470
It won't let me.

1837
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:47,650
But we don't live forever, do we?

1838
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,500
Logan, thank you for the five gifted.

1839
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,400
Wait!

1840
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,340
Do I have to kill that guy?

1841
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,240
I didn't save.

1842
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,200
What was the last one?

1843
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:08,880
This one?

1844
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,620
Oh my gosh.

1845
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,720
It was literally when I was about to shoot that guy.

1846
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:14,900
How?

1847
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,440
I think I have to shoot.

1848
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,020
I think I have to kill that cop like so fast.

1849
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,840
Yeah, I said it before killing Guza.

1850
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:31,560
Yeah, yeah.

1851
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:32,920
This is it with this one.

1852
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,540
We stand a greater chance of success than you, Lieutenant.

1853
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,560
What if I don't shoot him?

1854
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,640
He's got a gun though.

1855
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,360
He's going to shoot me.

1856
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,080
McCoy and I were just talking about how to get you guys out of your jam.

1857
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,040
We came up with a plan.

1858
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,980
But you've got to show yourself first.

1859
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,200
We've got to do this in person.

1860
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:58,200
And if I told you that Sadiq has a pulse rifle trained right at your heart...

1861
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:58,940
Oop!

1862
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,460
Without me, you for sure ain't going nowhere.

1863
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,300
Let's see what happens.

1864
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,040
Yeah, let's hear him out.

1865
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:04,500
Let's hear him out.

1866
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,240
We have everything we need.

1867
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,820
And that doesn't include you.

1868
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,040
Oh, I think he's about to die.

1869
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,680
Too bad that we're becoming such good friends.

1870
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,360
See ya!

1871
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:19,300
Whatever is born of mortal birth must be consumed with the earth.

1872
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,180
But he's still standing.

1873
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,200
Derives from generation free.

1874
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,540
Then what have I to do with thee?

1875
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:28,740
Shoot him again!

1876
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,940
Kiss my ass!

1877
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,740
I missed the part where that's my plan.

1878
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,120
So, what should we do with this detective?

1879
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,520
It's been so persistent.

1880
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,420
So it doesn't.

1881
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,440
Yeah.

1882
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,660
Wait, what do you mean it's over?

1883
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,600
No, don't shoot me.

1884
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:49,900
Oh, they're leaving?

1885
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,000
I can't...

1886
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,060
Wait, is he shooting at me?

1887
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,040
Ow!

1888
01:17:58,170 --> 01:17:59,270
They give me two...

1889
01:17:59,270 --> 01:17:59,470
Ah!

1890
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:00,530
Okay, okay.

1891
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,590
Okay, okay, okay.

1892
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,810
That guy's gonna die anyway.

1893
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,890
We stand a greater chance of success than you, Lieutenant.

1894
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:10,770
I don't think we should kill him.

1895
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,270
McCoy and I were just talking about how to get you guys out of your jam.

1896
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:14,730
Can you shoot him while he's running?

1897
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,330
We came up with a plan.

1898
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:17,150
Maybe.

1899
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,270
But you gotta show yourself first.

1900
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,510
We gotta do this in person.

1901
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:26,190
And if I told you that Sadiq has a pulse rifle...

1902
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:27,890
I bet you can shoot him while he runs past.

1903
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,910
That would be crazy!

1904
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:30,870
Without me, you for sure ain't going nowhere.

1905
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,830
If I leave and come back in...

1906
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,450
We have everything we need.

1907
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:38,210
And that doesn't include you.

1908
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,750
Oh.

1909
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:39,990
It won't let me leave.

1910
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,010
Too bad we've become such good friends.

1911
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:48,770
Whatever is born of mortal birth must be consumed with the Earth.

1912
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:53,950
I was gonna save so I don't have to hear it all over again, but...

1913
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:56,850
Then what have I to do with thee?

1914
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:57,610
With thee!

1915
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,210
Kiss my ass!

1916
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,330
Bye, Batman!

1917
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,230
So.

1918
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:04,930
Okay.

1919
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,390
What should we do with this detective?

1920
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:06,850
Alright.

1921
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,610
I'm gonna try and shoot him when he walks past.

1922
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,790
You know what I would do to you.

1923
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:13,690
Perhaps you're right.

1924
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:14,310
Okay.

1925
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,830
It's over.

1926
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:16,410
Okay.

1927
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,710
I don't know where he comes from.

1928
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:20,150
Oh!

1929
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:20,630
I missed him!

1930
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:21,270
Okay, run!

1931
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,050
Run!

1932
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,200
Well, I did shoot...

1933
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:30,620
Uh...

1934
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,680
I got in two hits.

1935
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,440
Do you think he's still there?

1936
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,640
Why am I so slow?

1937
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,320
Like, I'm not even in any rush.

1938
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,940
I was just getting shot at.

1939
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:41,880
I don't care, I guess.

1940
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,520
I think they're gone.

1941
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,060
I think they're...

1942
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,640
Well, we're not in trouble anymore.

1943
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,140
Let's save a different save.

1944
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,060
I guess we're not in trouble anymore.

1945
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,680
So now let's go back to my apartment.

1946
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,680
We're not going to the moon bus.

1947
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,380
I don't even know where that was!

1948
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,920
I didn't even know!

1949
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,460
Also, how would they know that I shot and killed Guza, huh?

1950
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,540
What a...

1951
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:13,620
What?

1952
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:17,200
I think he just was calling my bluff.

1953
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,540
I think he was bluffing.

1954
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,880
And he just killed me anyway.

1955
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,740
Get me out of the way.

1956
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,540
I don't know.

1957
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,300
Nice save rotation, right?

1958
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,400
Okay, where was it?

1959
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,000
I'm making sure there's no rats around.

1960
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,600
Um...

1961
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:30,760
Okay.

1962
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,000
What the?

1963
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,060
You're making me very unhappy.

1964
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:35,760
Oh my god!

1965
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,360
What's happening?

1966
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:40,640
Wait.

1967
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:42,620
Oh.

1968
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:43,740
Oh.

1969
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:44,200
Oh.

1970
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:44,780
Oh.

1971
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,400
Hey, what's happening?

1972
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:48,820
Am I dead?

1973
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,020
Get me out.

1974
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:51,460
Get up.

1975
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,440
Get up, McCoy.

1976
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:53,200
Ah!

1977
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:57,680
I'm sad!

1978
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,680
It's damned if you do, damned if you don't!

1979
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,540
What the hell?

1980
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,200
Why did we just stand there and let...

1981
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:08,880
And take it?

1982
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,280
Why did we just stand there and take it?

1983
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:16,400
It...

1984
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,840
It gave me the option to shoot, but...

1985
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:19,400
I...

1986
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,620
It didn't turn red, so...

1987
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,060
Okay.

1988
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,060
I will have to shoot really fast, I think.

1989
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:31,030
This guy...

1990
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,550
This guy can't stop killing me.

1991
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,750
What if I just leave really fast?

1992
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:35,510
Oh, okay.

1993
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:36,350
There we go.

1994
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:37,070
Yeah, see?

1995
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:39,450
I don't know what he's doing here.

1996
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:40,870
Alright.

1997
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,790
Shoot him, shoot him.

1998
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,450
Shoot him, shoot.

1999
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,710
See?

2000
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,050
It like...

2001
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,710
Oh, see?

2002
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:47,650
As soon as he walks past...

2003
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:48,110
Ah!

2004
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,270
I can't get, like, a good...

2005
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:57,710
You have to shoot the knife he used to pin your shadow down.

2006
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,210
What the

2007
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:03,340
heck?

2008
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,940
This game is...

2009
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,820
This is so wild.

2010
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,060
What if we...

2011
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,060
Wait, what if we go in here?

2012
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,500
What if we go see the twins?

2013
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,200
Hey, buddies.

2014
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,360
A little help here.

2015
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,640
A little help.

2016
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,220
Stick around.

2017
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,560
I may not be finished with you.

2018
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,420
Okay, never mind.

2019
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:20,040
Alright.

2020
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,340
I don't know another route.

2021
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:32,290
I don't know what to do here.

2022
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,370
This game is...

2023
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:37,110
Whack.

2024
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,910
If I go this way...

2025
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:42,690
Oh, they're gone now.

2026
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,500
Go out here.

2027
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,140
He's restraining you with his vampire telekinetic powers.

2028
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,200
I don't understand it at all.

2029
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,600
Onyx, thank you so much for five months.

2030
01:22:58,820 --> 01:22:59,420
Thank you.

2031
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:11,690
Locked.

2032
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:12,530
Locked.

2033
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,440
You gotta leave before he turns the corner.

2034
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:21,760
Oh, maybe if I, like, run away real fast.

2035
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,480
Should we try it one more time?

2036
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,860
It's very confusing.

2037
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,840
I keep forgetting that's an option.

2038
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:33,840
I could just leave.

2039
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,200
Maybe he chases me through the sewers.

2040
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,380
That sounds so scary, though.

2041
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,620
How do I get home?

2042
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,260
Uh...

2043
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,080
Trying to remember.

2044
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,940
We can just leave.

2045
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:48,780
We can just go.

2046
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:51,540
Locked.

2047
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:52,720
Oh, they're back.

2048
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,280
We shall figure it out.

2049
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,360
I believe.

2050
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,510
Was it La...

2051
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,870
Laugh to Ryder?

2052
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:11,830
Ha, I thought I don't remember.

2053
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:20,870
Alright.

2054
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:21,890
I try to leave.

2055
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,970
And...

2056
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:24,230
He...

2057
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:25,110
Does...

2058
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:26,610
Whatever the hell is happening here.

2059
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:28,710
And then I leave.

2060
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:30,250
I leave.

2061
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:31,070
Go, go, go, go.

2062
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,810
Ha ha ha ha.

2063
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:34,010
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

2064
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:34,670
Run.

2065
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:36,230
Run, Mikoy!

2066
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,570
Run, Mikoy, please.

2067
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:43,050
Oh, no time to dilly-dally.

2068
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:44,210
Chilly-shally.

2069
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,550
I went the wrong way.

2070
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:48,590
It was down.

2071
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:49,610
It was it?

2072
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:49,850
Okay.

2073
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:50,570
Thank you.

2074
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,350
Well...

2075
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:53,850
This guy's not after me anyway.

2076
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:54,530
I think we're safe.

2077
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,910
I'm not making him that sad, apparently.

2078
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:11,180
No!

2079
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,760
No, this is Izoi.

2080
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,380
It wasn't down.

2081
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,140
Unless it was the other down.

2082
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,780
Ha ha ha.

2083
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,820
East?

2084
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,560
I thought you meant weest.

2085
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:25,260
Ha ha ha ha.

2086
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:30,750
Ha ha ha ha.

2087
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,230
Ha ha ha.

2088
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,370
Ha ha ha.

2089
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:34,490
Ha ha ha.

2090
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:34,970
This down!

2091
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,010
Ha ha ha.

2092
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:37,090
Ha ha ha.

2093
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:37,410
Oh my gosh.

2094
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,810
Good thing we're not getting...

2095
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:40,290
Um...

2096
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:41,150
Followed.

2097
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:42,910
Okay.

2098
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,150
I think it's...

2099
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:45,270
This way.

2100
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:49,010
Ha ha ha ha.

2101
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:51,150
This is so...

2102
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:52,190
It gets so confusing.

2103
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,250
I wish I could...

2104
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:53,610
Yeah, yeah.

2105
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:53,990
Okay.

2106
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:54,910
Oh, wait.

2107
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:57,270
No, I'm gonna keep my gun now.

2108
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:00,990
What if we get double-crossed?

2109
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,530
Tough day, McCoy.

2110
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:04,310
You could say that.

2111
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:04,750
Yeah.

2112
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,330
Steel is looking for you.

2113
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:07,370
And Bryant.

2114
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:08,610
Don't shoot me.

2115
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,210
You better not.

2116
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:10,610
You've been keeping the whole department hopping.

2117
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:11,470
You and Guza.

2118
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:12,490
I didn't kill Guza.

2119
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:12,830
I know.

2120
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,770
I didn't kill Guza.

2121
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:14,230
You're looking for me too, Gav?

2122
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,570
And if he tries to kill me here, I will shoot Guza.

2123
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:17,370
Not killing.

2124
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:19,490
I'm in a good mood today.

2125
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:23,110
I will.

2126
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:25,430
You know you got some interesting neighbors, McCoy.

2127
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:26,450
I got my gun out.

2128
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:26,730
Yeah.

2129
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:29,050
Well, I've been too busy to visit lately.

2130
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:31,130
You gonna turn yourself in?

2131
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:33,490
I'm thinking about it.

2132
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:34,830
Think hard.

2133
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:37,350
You killed anyone yet?

2134
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:37,770
No.

2135
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:39,910
It's like I said before.

2136
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:40,790
Wait.

2137
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,890
You retire a human, your career is over.

2138
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:44,070
The policeman didn't...

2139
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,810
Your life too, maybe.

2140
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:45,410
You didn't run out.

2141
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,190
We're safe.

2142
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,610
We're safe.

2143
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:48,990
We're safe.

2144
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:51,650
But we don't live forever, do we?

2145
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:55,690
The policeman didn't run out and shoot me.

2146
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:55,850
Oh.

2147
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:02,190
We're safe.

2148
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:02,730
Very good.

2149
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:03,370
Act...

2150
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:03,810
Act...

2151
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,410
Act 6.

2152
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:05,790
5.

2153
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,970
Act 5.

2154
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:11,270
At last estimate, 5 billion tons of kippel surround this city.

2155
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:13,550
Eventually, it's going to have to be cleared away.

2156
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:14,230
Elden.

2157
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:15,970
We've got specials...

2158
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:16,610
Oh, it's Elden.

2159
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,050
But the attrition rate is enormous.

2160
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:18,910
No, no.

2161
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:21,010
There's only one way it can be accomplished.

2162
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,510
Why do they dress like this?

2163
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:25,410
Unfortunately, your way is illegal.

2164
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:26,650
For the moment, yes.

2165
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:28,410
The laws can be changed.

2166
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:33,070
And if replicants were allowed to work on Earth, imagine what your legacy would be.

2167
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:38,530
Governor Maurice Colvig, the national hero who eliminated toxic debris.

2168
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:39,090
Uh-oh.

2169
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:41,030
The glasses shining like that.

2170
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:41,570
I don't know.

2171
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:44,710
Can you possibly guarantee that no tragedies will occur?

2172
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:48,590
It's a very simple solution to an old design challenge.

2173
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:49,330
Phil Knight, yeah.

2174
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:53,010
Give them jobs on Earth, and they will never desire a different life.

2175
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:53,770
That...

2176
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,130
is a lie.

2177
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:56,110
Yeah, that is a lie.

2178
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:56,610
Who's there?

2179
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:56,970
Oh.

2180
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:01,170
It's one of my children, I think, and a very resourceful one at that.

2181
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:02,690
Why don't you show yourself?

2182
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:04,750
With pleasure.

2183
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:05,910
Call security.

2184
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:07,130
Globus!

2185
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,230
Who is this man?

2186
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:10,270
I'd like to ask the same question.

2187
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:13,130
One more word from him, and he'll be dead.

2188
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,230
I will not be spoken...

2189
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:15,970
Oh!

2190
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:18,330
You're certainly a man of your word.

2191
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:22,670
I want all the data you have on replicating DNA structures, the mutation studies, everything.

2192
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,030
Why don't you just take a seat?

2193
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,430
We'll have a little talk.

2194
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:27,770
I don't have time for talk.

2195
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:29,790
I wish I could help you.

2196
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:30,550
I really do.

2197
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:31,410
What is happening?

2198
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:32,390
What's going on?

2199
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:35,650
The four-year lifespan is unalterable.

2200
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:42,570
My friends, my family, dying before my very eyes, and all you can say is...

2201
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,010
there is...

2202
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,840
Time is precious, my son.

2203
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:48,160
Mmm.

2204
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:50,380
And you have been keeping yours well.

2205
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,640
Can you guys speak up a little?

2206
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:57,980
And when night comes, I'll go to place fit for woe, walking along the darkened valley with silent...

2207
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,340
melancholy.

2208
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:00,700
Oh!

2209
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:01,320
Oh!

2210
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:01,720
Oh!

2211
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:01,920
Oh!

2212
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,000
Start your brain!

2213
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,860
I would prefer him alive, if possible!

2214
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:10,860
Oh, oops.

2215
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,320
Who shot first?

2216
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,540
Okay, was it me?

2217
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:14,380
Ah!

2218
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,280
Oh, my God!

2219
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,580
Not exactly the conclusion I had in mind.

2220
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,540
Can you station guards in the mezzanine?

2221
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:25,900
Yes, sir, but...

2222
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:26,720
I mean...

2223
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,040
after that fall.

2224
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:28,980
Oh, don't be a fool.

2225
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:29,880
He's not dead yet.

2226
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,200
His time hasn't come.

2227
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,220
Maggie!

2228
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,400
Come here, girl!

2229
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,500
I just dropped my drink.

2230
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:46,860
I jumped so...

2231
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,730
Nothing.

2232
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:55,270
Where's the phone?

2233
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:00,940
Oh, my gosh.

2234
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:02,440
Everything happened...

2235
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,060
I didn't even have a chance to speak.

2236
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:06,120
I was...

2237
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,320
I was quoting...

2238
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,180
Devil May Cry.

2239
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:09,780
Suddenly...

2240
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:10,180
Maggie!

2241
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,080
Where's the phone?

2242
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:21,760
Oh, my gosh, shut up!

2243
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:27,540
Another retirement in the fourth sector today as a Blade Runner shot an alleged replicant in the middle of a crowded street.

2244
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:32,780
Lieutenant Edison Guza, supervisor of the LPD's rep DTEC unit, had this to say.

2245
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:35,220
It was a good, clean takedown.

2246
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,580
The public should thank us for retiring these skin jobs before they get into any real trouble.

2247
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,880
You want to get that thing out of my face before it ends up shooting film where the sun don't shine?

2248
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:44,740
Oh, my God, please.

2249
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:45,700
Pick up.

2250
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:46,580
Where you been, Slim?

2251
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,280
The boys told me you were kicked out.

2252
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:48,660
Oh!

2253
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,580
My dog is still missing.

2254
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,860
Cut the crap about the dog, okay?

2255
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,960
I got something that'll really rev your engine.

2256
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,360
No, no, I'm not cutting the crap about my dog.

2257
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,400
I got a line on where the skin jobs are hollin' up.

2258
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,820
Not the Yukon?

2259
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,420
Yesterday's news.

2260
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,240
Remember Gap was talking about that food bus messager?

2261
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:05,660
Maggie!

2262
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,700
Found out where they crash-landed it.

2263
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,060
Five will get you ten, they'll be licking their wounds there.

2264
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:10,840
Well...

2265
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:11,160
Excellent.

2266
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:11,820
Where do we go?

2267
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,300
What if the dog is the actual...

2268
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,080
How about Mwah?

2269
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,540
The actual evil.

2270
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,200
It's way the shit out there in the kippel.

2271
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,440
Way, way out.

2272
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,560
How are they getting into the city?

2273
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:24,080
They've been accessing to an old sewer tunnel.

2274
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,060
Dog is priority.

2275
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,880
Are we gonna air out the reps together, or what?

2276
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,500
I kind of like McCoy.

2277
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,000
He's so innocent in that regard.

2278
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,240
He's just like, Maggie, we die.

2279
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:31,940
First come, first serve.

2280
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,580
I share my bonuses with nobody.

2281
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:35,100
See you on the other side, Slim.

2282
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:45,250
Maggie!

2283
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:49,850
Maggie!

2284
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:56,450
Maggie, I will find you out there in this housecape of a city!

2285
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:59,970
If it's the last thing I do!

2286
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:03,250
Maggie!

2287
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:19,390
Should we sleep?

2288
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:22,130
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

2289
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,030
Why does he say that every time?

2290
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:24,990
You have a...

2291
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:26,430
You know you can take a nap.

2292
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:27,150
You can sleep.

2293
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:32,350
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

2294
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:34,570
Like, that's...

2295
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:35,210
That's you.

2296
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:35,910
You do that.

2297
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:37,590
Okay.

2298
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:39,230
So where do we go now?

2299
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:42,130
We talk to whatever her name is that was just on the phone.

2300
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,890
Wait, what happens if we click here?

2301
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:44,630
Nothing.

2302
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:46,190
Nothing?

2303
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:48,590
But you were supposed to give Maggie a treat here.

2304
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:50,930
It's John Wick time.

2305
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:51,350
Yeah.

2306
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:55,570
Fortunate dogless world we live in.

2307
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:55,930
Nothing.

2308
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:58,670
It's a dogless dog world.

2309
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,910
Your floor number, please.

2310
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:03,270
Wait, can we go to the roof?

2311
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:04,890
Roof.

2312
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,090
Destination locked.

2313
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:09,090
Your floor number, please.

2314
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:10,690
Okay, we can't go to the roof.

2315
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:15,050
Give me my car back, please.

2316
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:16,210
I'm going insane.

2317
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:19,610
Please give me my car.

2318
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,530
Please.

2319
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:22,570
Please.

2320
01:33:22,910 --> 01:33:23,090
Please.

2321
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:23,450
Please.

2322
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,930
What if I ask really nicely?

2323
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:27,810
Is the police station still locked?

2324
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:38,820
Locked.

2325
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:39,360
Seriously?

2326
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,720
Maggie enters carrying a gun in her mouth and points it at McCoy.

2327
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,760
She speaks her clever, Raymond, but you've learned too much.

2328
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,520
I'd rather not thank you so much for this 10 gifted.

2329
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,240
Thank you.

2330
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:09,240
She said to meet her somewhere, but I'm also just like, where?

2331
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:10,720
Madam?

2332
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,420
I have no car.

2333
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:15,740
I cannot go to the kibble or whatever the hell it's called.

2334
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:19,920
Hey, man.

2335
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:20,460
Hello.

2336
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:21,240
Hello, hello.

2337
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,680
I can't go to the kibble.

2338
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,660
What was in here?

2339
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,580
Now we're back in the sewers.

2340
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:38,420
This is like our second home at this point.

2341
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,500
Wait.

2342
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:45,900
This was not open before.

2343
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,360
Oh my gosh.

2344
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,560
It's a good thing I checked.

2345
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:50,580
Let's go.

2346
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,400
Oh my God.

2347
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:53,880
There's rats.

2348
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:01,770
I had to do it to him.

2349
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,060
How do I...

2350
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,700
Wait, what if I wanted to go home?

2351
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,880
Okay, that doesn't seem...

2352
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:12,480
There's only one way.

2353
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:14,860
Is this where I came from?

2354
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,060
No.

2355
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,940
Oh, the lady.

2356
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,600
Bad time you got here.

2357
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,340
Steely.

2358
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,040
That's her name.

2359
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,580
If I was a Nexus 6, you'd be dead.

2360
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,600
No, you'd be dead.

2361
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,920
I heard you stumbling around back there 10 minutes ago.

2362
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:29,480
I got a little hung up.

2363
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:30,360
Where's the moon bus?

2364
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:31,200
The moon bus!

2365
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:31,620
No close.

2366
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,160
You ready to take care of business?

2367
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,480
Oh yeah, man.

2368
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:35,440
Hell yeah.

2369
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,680
It's gonna be a hot time in the old town tonight.

2370
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:38,680
Hot dag.

2371
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,340
I liked how the fog is...

2372
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,480
The fog is giving rave.

2373
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,660
I don't like it.

2374
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,880
It smells like ambush territory.

2375
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,160
Smells like sewer.

2376
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:55,740
Oh, sorry.

2377
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:56,240
That's me.

2378
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:58,160
Two.

2379
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:05,420
Oh, steely.

2380
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,860
Always hated closed spaces.

2381
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:08,680
Steely.

2382
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:09,920
Hold on.

2383
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,420
I'll get an ambulance out here.

2384
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,160
I screwed the pooch this time, Slim.

2385
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:15,800
Promise.

2386
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,240
You'll waste Clovis.

2387
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,540
Touched pretty well, didn't I?

2388
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,440
What?

2389
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,920
This is...

2390
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,420
Nothing

2391
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,360
in here.

2392
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:32,060
What was the point of us coming in here?

2393
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:33,920
Oh

2394
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,980
my god.

2395
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:49,900
No!

2396
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,280
Wait, is that...

2397
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:52,820
Oh, that's us.

2398
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:53,140
Okay.

2399
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:54,700
Where do we need...

2400
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,360
We had a...

2401
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:55,820
Oh, this way.

2402
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:57,760
Just kidding.

2403
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:58,740
Not this way.

2404
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,580
Uh, the ambulance!

2405
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,300
Someone...

2406
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:02,920
Someone...

2407
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,480
Someone...

2408
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,200
Call an ambulance!

2409
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:05,360
Okay, this is where we came from.

2410
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:06,100
So we go this way.

2411
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:15,430
Um...

2412
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,050
This is where I just saved, right?

2413
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:17,490
Yeah.

2414
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:18,910
Sorry, I'm...

2415
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:20,070
Save's coming a little bit.

2416
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,650
I don't think there was a way to save her.

2417
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,240
Where do we go from here?

2418
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:31,420
I

2419
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:38,130
don't think there was a way to save her.

2420
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:46,580
The moon!

2421
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:47,080
Maggie!

2422
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,260
Come here, girl.

2423
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:48,840
Come on.

2424
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:49,480
Don't do it.

2425
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:50,360
No, no, no.

2426
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,280
No.

2427
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:51,980
No, no.

2428
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:52,640
Don't do it.

2429
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,320
Don't you dare do it.

2430
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,700
I'm searching.

2431
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,540
Don't do it.

2432
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:58,480
Don't do it.

2433
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:58,840
Please.

2434
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,620
Please let my dog come to me.

2435
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,040
Please.

2436
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,840
Please let my dog get here.

2437
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,400
Please don't shoot him.

2438
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,720
Please, please don't shoot my dog.

2439
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,380
Please don't shoot my dog.

2440
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:07,980
Please.

2441
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:08,720
Please, Maggie!

2442
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,260
Maggie, don't fall from the rat.

2443
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:10,520
Okay.

2444
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,500
Please, Maggie, why did you... Please!

2445
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,200
How could they?

2446
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:21,020
Oh, God.

2447
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:22,800
No.

2448
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:24,980
You like my present month?

2449
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:26,560
You bastard!

2450
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:27,760
She was an innocent!

2451
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,720
I'm a figma.

2452
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,580
I'm a sheep, like you.

2453
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:36,260
Tyrell, you make her more doggy than dog, you know?

2454
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:38,260
That's a lie!

2455
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,860
You don't remember it?

2456
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,840
I'm taking none of it.

2457
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,280
Them false memories.

2458
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,440
They really worked you good.

2459
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:48,000
Come on out and show yourself, you coward!

2460
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,540
His reaction was too... Oh, there he is!

2461
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,620
Oh, I almost got him.

2462
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:53,800
Come here!

2463
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,830
Come out, coward!

2464
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:59,830
Oh, where are you shooting from?

2465
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:01,230
Where are you shooting from?

2466
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:02,670
Where?

2467
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,220
Oh, my God!

2468
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,300
I knew it was gonna happen.

2469
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:33,320
But I didn't expect his reaction to be like... Oh, God, no!

2470
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,740
Oh, no, Maggie!

2471
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,460
Maggie!

2472
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,400
Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.

2473
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,880
She was innocent!

2474
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:47,720
Maggie!

2475
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,880
The way she exploded!

2476
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:51,520
Maggie!

2477
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:52,680
Come here, girl!

2478
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,320
Come on!

2479
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,780
I can't!

2480
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,620
I can't!

2481
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:57,140
I can't!

2482
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:57,920
Wait, can I run?

2483
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:59,020
Okay, we can run to her.

2484
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:00,800
Maggie!

2485
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:01,740
Maggie, Maggie!

2486
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:02,460
Here you go, baby.

2487
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:03,280
Dinner time.

2488
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:07,400
How could they?

2489
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,220
Oh, God.

2490
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:12,980
No.

2491
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,140
You like my present, ma?

2492
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,780
You bastard!

2493
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:17,940
She was an innocent!

2494
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:19,920
She's a big man.

2495
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,740
A machine, like you!

2496
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:26,440
Cyra, you make her more... doggy than dogs, you know?

2497
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,440
That's a lie!

2498
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,980
You don't remember it?

2499
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,520
I'm taking...

2500
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,060
No, no, Maggie!

2501
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:32,480
No, no, Maggie!

2502
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,460
Then follow the memories!

2503
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:34,240
Please!

2504
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,200
I don't want you!

2505
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,520
Oh, wait!

2506
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:38,220
Come on out and show yourself, you coward!

2507
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,420
Wait, I need my gun!

2508
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:39,940
Oh, shoot!

2509
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:40,760
I don't have my gun!

2510
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:42,860
Shoot him!

2511
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:43,860
Oh, I got him.

2512
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:44,620
I got his ass.

2513
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,820
Nothing else there.

2514
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,400
That one's for Maggie!

2515
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:00,420
You bastard!

2516
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:00,660
You bastard!

2517
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:11,190
Holy cow!

2518
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:18,520
Holy cow!

2519
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,360
Sorry!

2520
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:20,460
I'm good!

2521
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,920
I'm good!

2522
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:24,600
I'm good!

2523
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,040
I'm good!

2524
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:26,720
Okay, we can go that way!

2525
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,420
We can go this way!

2526
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:30,100
Let's go!

2527
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:31,720
Let's go this way!

2528
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:38,780
Okay, sorry.

2529
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:39,800
Sorry, Steely.

2530
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,920
Anyway, okay.

2531
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:41,300
Anyway.

2532
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,200
Oh!

2533
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:44,840
Is this John Wick?

2534
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,780
Yeah, we really are John Wick now!

2535
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:47,740
And he...

2536
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:48,580
Nothing else there.

2537
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,000
You click on his body!

2538
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,920
I was expecting a yuck.

2539
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:55,060
I'm not gonna lie, but...

2540
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:56,500
Sheesh.

2541
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:58,280
It's so funny.

2542
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,140
The Moon Boss.

2543
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:01,720
Are we gonna remember everything now?

2544
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:02,660
Before...

2545
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,440
You guys, before I go in...

2546
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,120
I'm gonna go get some more water real quick.

2547
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:10,760
I can't...

2548
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:11,500
I can't...

2549
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,040
I can't...

2550
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,270
We fed her the tree and she's...

2551
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,100
What if it was me?

2552
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,220
What if I killed her?

2553
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:24,540
Oh, okay.

2554
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,700
Okay, I'll be right back.

2555
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,150
I'm gonna go get some more water.

2556
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:29,510
What?

2557
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:34,450
Okay.

2558
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:35,990
Alright, I'll be right back.

2559
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:37,230
I'll be right back.

2560
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:47,900
I'm back.

2561
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:48,820
Sorry about that.

2562
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:54,100
I guess you know that we're endgame because everybody keeps exploding.

2563
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,270
I can't stop laughing about...

2564
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:58,960
About everything.

2565
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:03,100
Everything that's happened in like the past 10 minutes has been so funny.

2566
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:05,600
Did you feed Maggie a grenade, apparently?

2567
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:10,540
Oh my gosh, that is the Eiffel Tower in the background, isn't it?

2568
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:12,320
Wait, but we're in LA.

2569
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:16,160
How is that possible?

2570
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:20,700
That's the...

2571
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:23,700
The...

2572
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:25,560
La... La... La... La...

2573
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:27,400
The LA...

2574
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,160
Full Tower.

2575
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,940
Wait, what's that movie?

2576
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,200
Where you...

2577
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,760
The Planet of the Apes.

2578
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,360
It's Planet of the Apes right now.

2579
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:41,360
There was an Eiffel Tower in 2019, LA.

2580
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,960
Oh yeah, I remember that.

2581
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:43,560
I remember that.

2582
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:46,560
They had it just for 2019 and then said...

2583
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:47,420
Yeah...

2584
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,580
Yeah, we don't need this anymore.

2585
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,460
Yeah, we're...

2586
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,380
Whoa, whoa, yeah!

2587
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:54,820
What if it's Tokyo Tower?

2588
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,740
That would make sense.

2589
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:57,960
Alright, let's go inside the...

2590
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:00,160
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to go inside the moon bus.

2591
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,360
Scores!

2592
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:02,220
Happy Birthday!

2593
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,280
Happy Birthday!

2594
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:05,880
Okay, let's go.

2595
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,660
Frequent flyer points.

2596
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:13,680
Visit all locations.

2597
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,640
Oh, Clovis is in his little blankie.

2598
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:19,980
He's not...

2599
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,680
I guess he's not...

2600
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,200
He's not...

2601
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,580
Wait, I could shoot him right now.

2602
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:30,710
Did I beat the game?

2603
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,610
What a waste.

2604
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:40,430
That one's for Maggie.

2605
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:41,510
What a waste.

2606
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:43,310
Wait, so if I just leave...

2607
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:44,890
I guess I should have talked to him.

2608
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:45,770
I see Steel didn't make it.

2609
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:46,550
Oh my god, wait!

2610
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:48,450
I could have used you about 10 minutes ago.

2611
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:51,510
Let's see this through and then we'll do like the second ending, I guess.

2612
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:53,390
See, Bryant wants to talk to you.

2613
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:55,310
He says you're really ready now.

2614
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:57,350
It never ends, does it?

2615
01:46:57,970 --> 01:46:58,330
Uh-uh.

2616
01:46:59,150 --> 01:47:00,830
You're a real Blade Runner now.

2617
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:03,550
Full retirement bonuses and everything.

2618
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:06,130
You've done a man's job, sir.

2619
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:08,570
How come I don't feel good about it?

2620
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,510
Uh, cause your dog exploded.

2621
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:10,870
Who knows?

2622
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:12,750
Buy yourself another animal, maybe.

2623
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:15,450
A real one, not a Tyrell fake.

2624
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,370
She wasn't fake.

2625
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:20,310
Whatever you wanna believe, McCoy.

2626
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:22,910
Oh, McCoy.

2627
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:26,910
What is that?

2628
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,450
Was that a Paper Maggie?

2629
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:30,290
Oh no, it was the Ore...

2630
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:33,050
Is this the origin of the Oregarmi Killer?

2631
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:35,610
No kidding!

2632
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:44,760
Completed the game on me.

2633
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:55,950
Oh, wait.

2634
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:57,430
We'll go back, you guys.

2635
01:47:57,650 --> 01:48:00,350
We're gonna go back and we're gonna talk to him for real.

2636
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:05,150
But that can't be how it ends, Nona.

2637
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:09,970
He was all tucked in.

2638
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:10,970
He was ready for bed.

2639
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:12,510
Oh.

2640
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:16,010
Who made the...

2641
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:17,030
The Oregarmi?

2642
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:22,330
I wanna see what...

2643
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:22,710
What...

2644
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:23,750
What's his name...

2645
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:25,310
Jarvis has to say.

2646
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:27,770
I can't remember his name.

2647
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:30,650
Clover...

2648
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,790
Chovus?

2649
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:32,770
Is it Chovus?

2650
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:35,610
Oh, God.

2651
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:43,770
Gaff makes origami figures.

2652
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:44,990
Oh, Clovis!

2653
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:46,910
I was close with Clover.

2654
01:48:57,950 --> 01:49:00,110
Ray McCoy, the man that you are.

2655
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:00,330
Ray McCoy, the man that you are.

2656
01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:01,590
Wait, there's a guy named Dino?

2657
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:03,410
We missed him!

2658
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:08,050
Oh, the French voice actors.

2659
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:11,190
Oh, Philippe.

2660
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:12,290
And Gerard.

2661
01:49:12,530 --> 01:49:14,170
And another Philippe.

2662
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:16,100
And another Philippe.

2663
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:17,790
And...

2664
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:18,510
Yuck.

2665
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:29,650
Oh, gosh.

2666
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:32,910
I...

2667
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:37,830
Kind of wanna see what happens if we...

2668
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:40,970
Side with...

2669
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:42,050
The...

2670
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:44,670
Because there's the other ending where you side with the replicants.

2671
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:47,190
Do not ask Mint to tuck me in at night.

2672
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:50,390
Meet

2673
01:49:53,870 --> 01:49:54,590
at the moon, boss.

2674
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:56,250
How did we meet...

2675
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:56,930
What's her name?

2676
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,390
Steely.

2677
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,870
She calls us.

2678
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:01,150
And then we go to...

2679
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:03,690
Uh...

2680
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:06,500
Wait.

2681
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:07,660
One second.

2682
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,340
Okay, there's a couple things I wanna do.

2683
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:10,380
First...

2684
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,800
I wanna go in here.

2685
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,000
First...

2686
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:21,050
And we'll talk to him for real.

2687
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:23,870
I've been expecting you.

2688
01:50:24,030 --> 01:50:24,370
Yeah.

2689
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:25,950
What are you reading?

2690
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:26,470
They're all dead.

2691
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:28,130
You're the last one.

2692
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:29,910
I wish I could just leave.

2693
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:34,010
Just power up this ship and fly away.

2694
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:36,410
Is he...

2695
01:50:36,410 --> 01:50:37,910
Oh, his four-year lifespan?

2696
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:39,390
There's no rest to do.

2697
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:40,430
And no more time.

2698
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:42,550
You want me to feel sorry for you.

2699
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:44,970
But after what you did to Maggie...

2700
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:45,710
No way.

2701
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:46,250
So true.

2702
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:48,370
And what about you, Ray McCoy?

2703
01:50:50,230 --> 01:50:51,950
He's just dying all of a sudden?

2704
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:53,430
Oh, well, he did jump out that window.

2705
01:50:55,110 --> 01:50:57,550
Do you not also seek forgiveness?

2706
01:50:58,130 --> 01:50:59,250
I don't need to.

2707
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:00,270
He's so eepy.

2708
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:04,210
I thought I could cheat my destiny.

2709
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:05,770
You killed my dog.

2710
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:11,850
I should have cherished what little time I had instead of wasting even one precious minute on revenge.

2711
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:14,230
Coughs in red.

2712
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:17,590
My hands are labored day and night.

2713
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:21,690
And ease comes never in my son.

2714
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:22,330
Okay, Shakespeare.

2715
01:51:22,670 --> 01:51:23,010
Hurry up.

2716
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:27,830
Wife has no indulgence given except what comes to her from heaven.

2717
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:28,930
We eat little and we drink less.

2718
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:30,210
Given and heaven do not rhyme.

2719
01:51:30,210 --> 01:51:33,590
This earth breathes not our happiness.

2720
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:35,910
Another sun.

2721
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:37,630
Oh my god, he keeps going.

2722
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:41,910
We are not warmed with thy beams.

2723
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:44,070
With thy...

2724
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:47,030
Oh, I can just shut him up.

2725
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:47,110
Look.

2726
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:48,710
Oh, yet the space...

2727
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:49,810
That I do see.

2728
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:52,510
But my mind...

2729
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:55,170
Is not with thy light arrayed.

2730
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:58,930
My terrors...

2731
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:00,530
Shall not make me afraid.

2732
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:01,190
What if I leave?

2733
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:02,130
Oh.

2734
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:02,950
Oh.

2735
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:06,420
Oops.

2736
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:12,810
I see steel didn't make it.

2737
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,410
I could have used you about ten minutes ago.

2738
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:17,570
You didn't need any help, McCoy.

2739
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:20,350
Chief Bryant wants to talk to you.

2740
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:22,270
He says you're really ready now.

2741
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:24,310
It never ends, does it?

2742
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:25,250
Uh-uh.

2743
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:27,650
You're a real Blade Runner now.

2744
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:28,510
This game is...

2745
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:30,350
Full retirement bonuses and everything.

2746
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:30,550
Making me sick.

2747
01:52:31,370 --> 01:52:33,070
You've done a man's job, sir.

2748
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:35,470
How come I don't feel good about it?

2749
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:36,690
Who knows?

2750
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:39,710
Buy yourself another animal, maybe.

2751
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:42,370
A real one, not a Tyrell fake.

2752
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:43,570
A real one.

2753
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:46,150
Okay, okay, whatever.

2754
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:47,230
Whatever you say.

2755
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:48,370
Okay.

2756
01:52:48,630 --> 01:52:50,430
Oh, I should've...

2757
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:51,110
Okay.

2758
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:54,970
Now there's one last thing we want to do.

2759
01:52:55,390 --> 01:53:00,930
We want to try and get the other ending where we side with the replicates.

2760
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:03,530
So...

2761
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:05,330
Maybe that will save Maggie.

2762
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:08,370
I think we go...

2763
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:08,950
Okay.

2764
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:12,190
I think we shoot the guy, then we go back home.

2765
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:14,710
And then we'll get the call from Steely, I hope.

2766
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:16,670
It's gonna be a long one?

2767
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:17,050
Is it?

2768
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:18,090
Is it a much longer ending?

2769
01:53:18,270 --> 01:53:18,490
We'll see.

2770
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:20,950
We stand a greater chance of success than...

2771
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:23,270
Who the hell do you think you're getting, McCoy?

2772
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:24,150
You're gonna pry!

2773
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:25,790
Blim, blim, blim!

2774
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:27,370
And then I shoot him dead.

2775
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:30,190
And then he says...

2776
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:30,610
And then he says...

2777
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:30,950
The hunter?

2778
01:53:31,450 --> 01:53:33,070
He do us a favor mind.

2779
01:53:33,490 --> 01:53:35,110
He bagged us a traitor.

2780
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:36,750
Brother!

2781
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:38,150
Then they say meet us at the moon bus.

2782
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:39,390
You've killed a human.

2783
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:41,690
There's no going back now.

2784
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:44,530
Come out and show yourself.

2785
01:53:45,970 --> 01:53:47,270
First things first.

2786
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:50,710
You must decide where you belong, brother.

2787
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:50,990
Brother!

2788
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:53,990
Stop calling me that!

2789
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:55,230
Hehehehe.

2790
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:56,310
Always wanted a brother.

2791
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:58,490
You've wasted much precious time already.

2792
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:03,590
No more choices, Ray McCoy.

2793
01:54:04,890 --> 01:54:06,410
Meet us at the moon bus.

2794
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:07,270
The moon bus!

2795
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:10,670
Together we will face the tiger that waits in the night's forest.

2796
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:13,670
Tiger, tiger burning bright.

2797
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:16,570
Okay.

2798
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:20,750
Do you think they'll ambush my home?

2799
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:22,150
Is the bigger question.

2800
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:23,150
Alright, let's see.

2801
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:27,350
Brother!

2802
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:27,750
Ahh.

2803
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:33,630
How did I get to the moon bus?

2804
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:35,430
Maybe go to the moon bus instead of the apartment.

2805
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:36,330
Oh, wait.

2806
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:40,210
I do remember how to get to the moon bus.

2807
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:44,610
So maybe I don't need to go home?

2808
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:47,250
We'll try.

2809
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:49,910
Wait, let me get my gun out just in case there's a rat.

2810
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:53,350
This game has 13 endings?

2811
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:55,090
You're kidding me right now.

2812
01:54:56,150 --> 01:55:03,590
I guess it has a bunch of endings depending on whether someone is a replicant or not.

2813
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:05,570
This is to Izo.

2814
01:55:13,050 --> 01:55:16,950
Well, I'm safe to say I will not be getting all 13.

2815
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:19,990
It was...

2816
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:20,810
Here.

2817
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:24,610
If we didn't go back home.

2818
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:26,090
Let's see, let's see.

2819
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:31,450
Ah, see, it's not open yet.

2820
01:55:32,350 --> 01:55:34,130
This was how we get to the kibble.

2821
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:36,670
So, I think I do have to go home.

2822
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:40,850
Some endings are just with different characters.

2823
01:55:41,130 --> 01:55:42,050
That makes sense, yeah.

2824
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:46,890
Wow, good on them for making such an intensive game back in the day.

2825
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:52,580
A few are mostly variations, etc.

2826
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:54,000
But there's several uniques.

2827
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,260
Okay, so this is where we get ambushed.

2828
01:55:58,940 --> 01:55:59,380
By...

2829
01:55:59,380 --> 01:55:59,400
Yeah.

2830
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,260
I'm just gonna keep saving over.

2831
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:06,020
This is where we get ambushed by the cop that tries to kill us.

2832
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:08,100
I think we can try and just run inside.

2833
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:08,820
Let's do that.

2834
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:10,760
Tough day, McCoy.

2835
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:11,380
Hello.

2836
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:12,180
You could...

2837
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,900
And the cops...

2838
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:17,000
I'm thinking.

2839
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:21,800
I can't... I don't... I hate this part because I don't know where my cursor is, you know?

2840
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:22,880
Like I said before.

2841
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:25,900
You retire a human, your career is over.

2842
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:26,460
Wait, what?

2843
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:27,960
Your life too, maybe.

2844
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:28,980
Wait, where's the cop?

2845
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:32,800
Uh...

2846
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,660
But we don't live forever, do we?

2847
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,100
Was that a... random event?

2848
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:38,540
Wait...

2849
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:40,340
Wait...

2850
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:42,600
Well, you should have voted for him then.

2851
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:45,480
Very good.

2852
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:46,660
Very funny, yeah.

2853
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:47,700
Maggie!

2854
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:48,920
Come here, girl.

2855
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:51,260
Okay, no Maggie yet.

2856
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:51,680
Alright.

2857
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:54,100
Let's put my gun away.

2858
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:55,720
No way!

2859
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:57,820
That was a random event that the guy came?

2860
01:56:57,940 --> 01:57:01,200
But it was so serendipitous, it was like perfect timing!

2861
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:01,580
No!

2862
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,660
Where you been, Slim?

2863
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,760
The boys told me you were kicked hours ago.

2864
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:07,680
My dog is still missing.

2865
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,940
Cut the crap about the dog, okay?

2866
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,200
I got something that'll really rev your engine.

2867
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:13,820
I'm all ears.

2868
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,120
I'm so confused.

2869
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:17,920
Not the Yukon?

2870
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:19,540
Yesterday's news.

2871
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:22,380
Remember Gap was talking about that moon bus massacre?

2872
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:23,300
Moon bus massacre.

2873
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,820
Found out where they crash landed it.

2874
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:25,880
Five will get you ten.

2875
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,160
They'll be licking their wounds there.

2876
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:28,300
Excellent.

2877
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,000
Where do we go?

2878
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:30,000
We?

2879
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,140
How about Wah?

2880
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,560
Here's a hint, Slim.

2881
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:35,280
It's way the shit out there in the Kittle.

2882
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:35,740
How are the...

2883
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:35,900
Okay.

2884
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:36,360
Okay.

2885
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,460
We know how to get there.

2886
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:40,660
Huh?

2887
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,240
I...

2888
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:43,280
This game is...

2889
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,560
This game is blowing my mind right now.

2890
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:51,510
I guess I'll save over it.

2891
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:53,590
Wait, isn't it gonna be any different?

2892
01:57:53,870 --> 01:57:55,030
Well, they told me to meet them.

2893
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:55,930
Yeah, it should be different.

2894
01:57:57,470 --> 01:57:58,930
Your floor number, please.

2895
01:57:59,310 --> 01:58:01,290
What if I go down there and I'm ambushed?

2896
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:02,510
Ground floor.

2897
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:04,730
Roof.

2898
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:05,490
Roof.

2899
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:07,410
One last roof for the road.

2900
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:10,970
Good job on ending one anyway.

2901
01:58:12,010 --> 01:58:13,250
Act five was quick.

2902
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:15,470
Figured they'd also explode the coin in this car.

2903
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,550
We never got to see our car again.

2904
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:23,490
I didn't expect to be laughing at Maggie's death either.

2905
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:24,850
But it was just so funny.

2906
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:28,570
Gotta save Maggie.

2907
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:29,050
Yeah.

2908
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,870
I hope...

2909
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,910
I hope this ending doesn't have her explode.

2910
01:58:34,630 --> 01:58:35,730
Let's hope for that.

2911
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:40,130
And Steely, I guess, too.

2912
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:40,920
Because, um...

2913
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:42,830
Oh my god, wait.

2914
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:44,550
Red, red, red...

2915
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:47,370
Hello!

2916
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:48,430
Bad time you got here.

2917
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:53,430
If I was a Nexus 6, you'd be dead.

2918
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:55,470
No, you'd be dead.

2919
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:56,290
I heard you stumped.

2920
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:57,330
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2921
01:58:57,610 --> 01:58:57,950
Alright.

2922
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:02,670
Yeah!

2923
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:05,890
Alright, let's see how different it becomes.

2924
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:08,630
I don't like it.

2925
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:10,650
Smells like ambush territory.

2926
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:11,990
I think she's gonna explode.

2927
01:59:12,230 --> 01:59:12,330
Stop.

2928
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:13,190
Don't do it!

2929
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:15,090
Don't do it!

2930
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:16,090
I can't stop her.

2931
01:59:16,210 --> 01:59:16,770
Oh, yes I can.

2932
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:17,010
Wait.

2933
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:17,970
What?

2934
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:19,590
There's a trigger there.

2935
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:20,370
See it?

2936
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:22,030
And what's that blinking?

2937
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:23,330
I stopped her!

2938
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:26,350
Crafty little suckers.

2939
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:27,550
I stopped her!

2940
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:28,750
Could be on a timer.

2941
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:30,810
Looks like Sadiq's work.

2942
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:33,470
Same setup as the one at the Rhett manufacturing plant.

2943
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:34,910
Step around it.

2944
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:35,630
We should clear it.

2945
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:38,590
All this kiffle gives me the heebie-jeebies.

2946
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:40,470
I need room to breathe.

2947
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:43,950
Take a deep breath around here, you'll cough up a lung.

2948
01:59:44,690 --> 01:59:45,170
Oh?

2949
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:46,670
Oh, wait.

2950
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:47,550
What's that beeping sound?

2951
01:59:48,030 --> 01:59:49,010
Please don't explode.

2952
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:49,530
Wait.

2953
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:50,450
Is it gonna explode?

2954
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:51,010
Oh.

2955
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:52,450
Okay.

2956
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:52,970
We're fine.

2957
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:54,230
Maggie!

2958
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:55,390
Come here, girl!

2959
01:59:55,530 --> 01:59:55,990
Come on!

2960
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:58,130
What's that tide around her?

2961
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:58,750
Oh!

2962
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:00,930
Maggie!

2963
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:01,610
Here you go, baby.

2964
02:00:01,870 --> 02:00:02,450
Dinner time.

2965
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:06,570
How could they?

2966
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:08,790
Let's attend to some business.

2967
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:12,710
Oh, God.

2968
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:14,470
No.

2969
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:16,610
You like my present, ma?

2970
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:18,250
You bastard!

2971
02:00:18,530 --> 02:00:19,430
She was an innocent!

2972
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,370
I'm big, ma.

2973
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:23,250
I'm a sheep, like you.

2974
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:26,110
Tyra, you think I'm on?

2975
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:27,930
Doggy the dog, you know?

2976
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:29,970
That's a lie!

2977
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:32,130
Where did she go?

2978
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:33,510
None of it.

2979
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:34,950
Them false memories.

2980
02:00:34,950 --> 02:00:37,190
They really worked you good.

2981
02:00:37,650 --> 02:00:39,750
Come on out and show yourself, you coward!

2982
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:43,870
Where did she go?

2983
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:46,170
Wait, what are you doing?

2984
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:50,330
Where did she go?

2985
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:51,310
She went this way.

2986
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:55,010
Ma'am?

2987
02:00:57,930 --> 02:01:00,490
Let's attend to some business in this...

2988
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,290
Oh, my God.

2989
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:14,430
Nothing else there.

2990
02:01:14,730 --> 02:01:15,650
Oh, my God!

2991
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:20,810
Well, I guess we're getting a different ending because she's alive!

2992
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:23,210
I'm finishing this alone, Steel.

2993
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:24,690
No chance.

2994
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:25,230
Steely!

2995
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:27,130
The bastard killed my dog.

2996
02:01:27,410 --> 02:01:28,870
He tried to convince me I wasn't human.

2997
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:29,270
Yeah!

2998
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:31,610
The job ain't about revenge, McCoy.

2999
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:33,850
If it's the money you're worried about, you can have it.

3000
02:01:33,850 --> 02:01:34,370
The name's Wick.

3001
02:01:34,730 --> 02:01:36,070
But I'm doing this one alone.

3002
02:01:36,650 --> 02:01:38,350
You're a stubborn son of a bitch.

3003
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:41,010
Look, I'll give you two minutes.

3004
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:41,910
That's all.

3005
02:01:42,010 --> 02:01:42,650
Are you gonna shoot me?

3006
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:44,690
Oh, and she's off again.

3007
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:46,290
I

3008
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:51,260
walk in there very slowly.

3009
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,340
I've been expecting you.

3010
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:01,820
Hi, dog.

3011
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:04,000
My dog!

3012
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:06,060
My high dog!

3013
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:08,600
It's a doggy dog world.

3014
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:10,760
They're all dead.

3015
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:12,360
You're the last one.

3016
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,180
I wish I could just leave.

3017
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:18,320
Just power up this ship and fly away.

3018
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:20,860
But there's nowhere else to go.

3019
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:21,520
But there's nowhere else to go.

3020
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:22,000
I don't know.

3021
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:24,360
I was kind of thinking about just sitting here and wondering.

3022
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:26,520
Let's just let him yap.

3023
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,120
Let's let him yap and see if she will come inside.

3024
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,000
No way.

3025
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,600
And what about you, Ray McCoy?

3026
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:36,460
After what you did to my family?

3027
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:37,700
My friends.

3028
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:38,080
My dog!

3029
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,780
Do you not also seek forgiveness?

3030
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,480
I don't need to.

3031
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,020
I don't need to.

3032
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:48,440
I thought I could cheat my destiny.

3033
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:52,640
I should have cherished what little time I had instead of waiting.

3034
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:55,720
My hands are labored day and night.

3035
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:55,780
Okay.

3036
02:02:56,780 --> 02:03:00,240
And ease comes never in my sight.

3037
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:06,180
My wife has no indulgence given except what comes to her from heaven.

3038
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,420
We eat little, we drink less.

3039
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,160
Maybe we don't need to wait for her.

3040
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:12,140
I never did like poetry.

3041
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:12,960
laughing

3042
02:03:30,090 --> 02:03:31,890
For a waste.

3043
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:33,610
Awww!

3044
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:39,470
laughing Okay!

3045
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:41,050
Jesus, Slim.

3046
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:42,930
I almost blew your brains out.

3047
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:44,250
Do it.

3048
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:46,270
You just might be doing me a favor.

3049
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:46,810
Damn!

3050
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:48,550
Yeah...

3051
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:50,110
I think he got a promotion coming.

3052
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:53,190
Not to mention all those retirement bonuses.

3053
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:54,510
Do I have a lady friend now?

3054
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:57,910
As long as I get something like 20 hours of sleep in the process.

3055
02:03:58,290 --> 02:03:59,050
Am I right?

3056
02:03:59,710 --> 02:04:00,610
I'm going home, Steel.

3057
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:01,530
I'm finished.

3058
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:02,250
Steely.

3059
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:05,110
Our dog.

3060
02:04:05,630 --> 02:04:06,070
Hey, Slim.

3061
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:06,650
What?

3062
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:07,430
Oh, new ending.

3063
02:04:07,650 --> 02:04:08,550
You ever think of working with a partner?

3064
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:11,890
I thought you only worked alone.

3065
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:13,570
There's a first for everything.

3066
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:15,630
I'll think about it.

3067
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:18,770
I'm much better company than a dog, you know.

3068
02:04:22,050 --> 02:04:24,730
Oh, the little eyebrow raise.

3069
02:04:26,110 --> 02:04:27,550
Miss Steely.

3070
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:32,190
Steely McCoy has a good ring to it.

3071
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:37,030
Wait, her last name is Steel, isn't it?

3072
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:38,250
Whatever, it's fine.

3073
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:40,810
She can take them both.

3074
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:45,310
Okay, well, we got a different ending.

3075
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:47,730
You know what?

3076
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:48,350
I'm...

3077
02:04:50,110 --> 02:04:51,330
I don't think...

3078
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:55,290
I can't believe they still killed my dog, even after I sided with them.

3079
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:57,110
Those bastards...

3080
02:05:00,670 --> 02:05:02,270
Maybe this is the good end.

3081
02:05:02,830 --> 02:05:03,890
Oh yeah, they banging.

3082
02:05:05,090 --> 02:05:05,650
Bink!

3083
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:13,610
You can't save Maggie, unfortunately.

3084
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:14,490
No!

3085
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:18,790
The line.

3086
02:05:19,090 --> 02:05:21,370
I was never a fan of poetry.

3087
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:27,390
What if you said your name in a creepy voice?

3088
02:05:27,710 --> 02:05:27,990
Wait, what?

3089
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:28,750
Oh.

3090
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:37,900
This is so silly.

3091
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:39,140
This is so funny.

3092
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,640
Can we fly the kipple?

3093
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:49,760
I think the kipple is the area, no?

3094
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:52,200
The kipple is not the moon bus.

3095
02:05:56,020 --> 02:05:56,620
Oh.

3096
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:00,240
Is there an ending where everyone explodes?

3097
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:05,000
We saved the girl.

3098
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:09,040
If you enjoy these kinds of old school adventure games, you should check out...

3099
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,840
Mystery of the Druids.

3100
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,040
Easily one of my favorites.

3101
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:12,960
Oh, interesting.

3102
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:14,500
I do really like these.

3103
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:16,780
It has such a charm to it.

3104
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:19,700
And then also, like...

3105
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:25,980
It just is so funny in the most random ways, you know?

3106
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:29,580
Like...

3107
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:31,090
His delivery after...

3108
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,080
Us feeding the dog and it exploding...

3109
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:38,780
It's so funny.

3110
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:40,720
It's so, so funny.

3111
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:42,600
Mystery of the Druids mentioned.

3112
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,300
I think I've heard of it before.

3113
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:44,980
I'm gonna look it up.

3114
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:46,400
Camp Noir!

3115
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:48,140
That's a perfect way of putting it.

3116
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,070
Mystery of the Druids.

3117
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:54,340
What is this cover?

3118
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:55,740
Oh my god.

3119
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:57,920
Oh my god.

3120
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,220
Holy cow.

3121
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:03,920
It reminds me of playing those, uh...

3122
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,340
Like, FMV type games.

3123
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:06,920
Where they have, like, the real people.

3124
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:09,380
Like, Scand...

3125
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:10,340
Like, you know...

3126
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:13,240
Camp Noir.

3127
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:14,840
That's a great way of putting it.

3128
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,200
Maggie exploded and you're laughing?

3129
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:18,440
I'm sorry.

3130
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:19,180
It was so funny.

3131
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:24,600
It's such a good time.

3132
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:25,620
I'll look into it.

3133
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:27,480
I'll see if I can find a way to play it.

3134
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:30,200
Oh no.

3135
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,920
My retro gaming era is here.

3136
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:37,180
But recently, I've been really wanting to play like, uh...

3137
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:39,180
I don't know.

3138
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:40,740
Like, some sort of adventure game.

3139
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,380
Almost like an Indiana Jones-esque.

3140
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,220
But like, third person.

3141
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:46,820
I don't know.

3142
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:48,480
I've been wanting to play something.

3143
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:51,180
So many good point-and-click PC adventures.

3144
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:55,400
Police quest open season gave me nightmares as a kid, but it's hilarious in my thirties.

3145
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:56,460
I don't know that.

3146
02:07:58,520 --> 02:07:59,160
Yeah.

3147
02:07:59,160 --> 02:07:59,960
Like Uncharted?

3148
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:01,320
Well, uh...

3149
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,100
Yes, I could play Uncharted.

3150
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:03,840
But...

3151
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,420
I meant like, uh...

3152
02:08:05,420 --> 02:08:06,040
Gameplay.

3153
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:08,320
Rather than...

3154
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:09,560
The...

3155
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:11,380
Than the, um...

3156
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:15,420
But I do want to play Uncharted.

3157
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:17,260
Maybe I should start that.

3158
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:19,380
Hmm...

3159
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:19,720
Let's go.

3160
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:24,320
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

3161
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,280
I used to play that as a kid too.

3162
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:30,080
Tomb Raider?

3163
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:30,660
Hell no.

3164
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:32,940
I played that demo of Tomb Raider.

3165
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:33,760
If you didn't see...

3166
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:35,380
I played like, a bunch of demo discs.

3167
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:36,460
At one point.

3168
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:38,060
And I played a demo of Tomb Raider.

3169
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:38,660
And...

3170
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:39,420
I can't...

3171
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:41,460
I don't understand the controls at all.

3172
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:43,480
It's...

3173
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:45,640
It's too difficult for me.

3174
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:53,500
My princess, thank you!

3175
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:55,220
Thank you, thank you.

3176
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:57,880
Dang, we only were like, two hours out.

3177
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:58,920
From beating the game.

3178
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:00,660
And I was a little slow.

3179
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:03,940
I thought it might be a little bit longer.

3180
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:04,660
But...

3181
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:05,740
It ended up being quite short.

3182
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:11,290
Have you ever played the Jack Trilogy?

3183
02:09:11,610 --> 02:09:12,590
I haven't!

3184
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:13,770
Also, hi!

3185
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:14,250
Hello!

3186
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:18,390
I know this game is very nostalgic for you.

3187
02:09:18,510 --> 02:09:19,970
It was really good for its age.

3188
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:21,530
Thanks for taking us on this journey.

3189
02:09:21,690 --> 02:09:22,510
Yeah, thank you!

3190
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:24,250
There are parts that...

3191
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:27,370
I...

3192
02:09:29,290 --> 02:09:30,710
Completely misremembered as a kid.

3193
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:34,510
I think...

3194
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:37,330
There are parts that I remember...

3195
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,350
Shooting more.

3196
02:09:41,650 --> 02:09:44,530
Maybe my dad discovered things that I didn't...

3197
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:45,810
I didn't discover.

3198
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:48,390
Thanks for the super unintentionally silly game.

3199
02:09:48,930 --> 02:09:49,790
Thank you!

3200
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:52,650
Thank you!

3201
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:52,870
Thank you!

3202
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:53,650
Too bad about Maggie.

3203
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:54,810
But she will always remain...

3204
02:09:54,810 --> 02:09:55,470
In our hearts.

3205
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:56,570
Through the lulls.

3206
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:57,590
Thank you.

3207
02:09:57,650 --> 02:09:57,990
Do I go?

3208
02:10:01,190 --> 02:10:01,970
Implanted memories.

3209
02:10:02,430 --> 02:10:03,890
Am I a replicant?

3210
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:13,540
Totally didn't show you the nightclub.

3211
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:15,620
I don't remember the nightclub.

3212
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,580
At all.

3213
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:18,640
So I am very convinced that...

3214
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:23,020
But I remember that pet shop at the very beginning.

3215
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:24,740
Like...

3216
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:25,920
Like...

3217
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,340
Like...

3218
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:26,780
Crazy.

3219
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:29,680
I knew that was the first part that we were gonna start at the game.

3220
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:30,540
Like I...

3221
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,480
Like there were some parts that I was like...

3222
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:35,200
Ah, I know this place.

3223
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:35,940
I know this place.

3224
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,040
So I...

3225
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:38,140
It's not that I think I forgot.

3226
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:41,820
When would I forget?

3227
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:43,900
Ah...

3228
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:46,440
Why would I forget?

3229
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:47,800
Ah...

3230
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:50,120
An Indiana Jones adventure game, you say?

3231
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:52,140
Well, I did do the one.

3232
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,180
The most recent one.

3233
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:58,440
Legendary classic Indiana Jones and the Faith of Atlantis.

3234
02:10:59,040 --> 02:10:59,920
I thought there were...

3235
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,740
I didn't realize there were other...

3236
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:03,320
Indiana Jones games.

3237
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:05,800
I thought it was just Lego Indiana Jones from here.

3238
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:13,530
Faith of Atlantis.

3239
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:17,290
Fate of Atlantis?

3240
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:17,970
Fate of Atlantis?

3241
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:18,650
Secret of Atlantis?

3242
02:11:18,810 --> 02:11:19,510
Oh, look it up.

3243
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:22,390
Indiana Jones.

3244
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:26,070
Atlantis.

3245
02:11:29,230 --> 02:11:30,970
Wait, the cover looks so good.

3246
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:33,170
It looks like an actual Indiana Jones movie.

3247
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:34,650
Ah...

3248
02:11:35,710 --> 02:11:36,350
Ah...

3249
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:37,790
It looks so good.

3250
02:11:40,410 --> 02:11:42,090
Oh, it's from 1992.

3251
02:11:42,850 --> 02:11:44,450
Wait, what kind of game is this?

3252
02:11:46,450 --> 02:11:47,730
Is it like a point and click?

3253
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:53,000
Metal Gear Revengeance.

3254
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:54,060
We'll get there.

3255
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:55,360
I'll do Revengeance after...

3256
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,580
After I finally get through V.

3257
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:04,090
It's like this?

3258
02:12:04,990 --> 02:12:06,530
Wait, that would be so fun.

3259
02:12:08,710 --> 02:12:10,370
And it's Indiana Jones!

3260
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:13,330
That sounds kind of fun.

3261
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:17,490
King's Quest 7 for point and click.

3262
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:18,990
I...

3263
02:12:18,990 --> 02:12:20,730
Wait, that game also sounds familiar.

3264
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:27,180
Oh, wait.

3265
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:30,240
Wait?

3266
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:34,420
Nah, I don't think I played it.

3267
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:36,860
But I do recognize it.

3268
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:38,100
Hmm.

3269
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:41,500
Ah...

3270
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,560
This is so fun.

3271
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,580
This is so fun.

3272
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:54,280
There's so many games I gotta play.

3273
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,920
Luckily, we have lots of time.

3274
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:00,180
We got lots and lots of time.

3275
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:05,660
More games like Doom.

3276
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:08,380
I still wanna play the new Doom.

3277
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:09,540
The...

3278
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:10,720
Medieval one.

3279
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:17,170
Playing Revengeance?

3280
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:17,910
Nah.

3281
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:23,390
It'll be really fun to play Revengeance now that I know everything.

3282
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:27,750
Because when I first played Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, uh...

3283
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:30,030
I hadn't played any of the other Metal Gear games.

3284
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:30,570
So...

3285
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:32,490
For me, it was just like a hack and slash.

3286
02:13:33,070 --> 02:13:33,550
Like...

3287
02:13:34,930 --> 02:13:35,410
But...

3288
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:37,750
Um...

3289
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:39,410
Now it'll be actually like...

3290
02:13:42,330 --> 02:13:43,010
I...

3291
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:45,250
Know what's going on, maybe.

3292
02:13:47,930 --> 02:13:48,610
So...

3293
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:51,510
You'll get to meet Split S...

3294
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:51,950
Split...

3295
02:13:51,950 --> 02:13:52,970
Don't call him that!

3296
02:13:56,830 --> 02:13:57,390
Don't...

3297
02:13:59,430 --> 02:13:59,990
Sam...

3298
02:14:04,360 --> 02:14:04,920
Sam...

3299
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:05,100
Sam...

3300
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,800
Actually invested in the story.

3301
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:07,420
I know!

3302
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:13,710
Will you play Snake's Revenge?

3303
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:15,010
I plan on it, eventually.

3304
02:14:16,210 --> 02:14:16,390
Yeah.

3305
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:21,480
Ugh...

3306
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:21,660
I've...

3307
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:23,880
I actually was struggling because I was like...

3308
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,800
I was like...

3309
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:26,060
There's...

3310
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:27,920
I wanna start a new series so bad...

3311
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:30,900
But I...

3312
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:34,040
Completely blanked out on everything that I was wanting to play.

3313
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:34,940
Minus like...

3314
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:37,000
Obviously Metal Gear V and...

3315
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,040
Death Stranding.

3316
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:40,560
Just trying to find good timing for those.

3317
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:43,440
Hmm...

3318
02:14:47,390 --> 02:14:49,330
We'll do karaoke session in the chat.

3319
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:50,050
Yeah!

3320
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:50,490
Yeah!

3321
02:14:50,690 --> 02:14:50,790
Yeah!

3322
02:14:50,790 --> 02:14:50,830
Yeah!

3323
02:14:50,990 --> 02:14:51,010
Yeah!

3324
02:14:51,010 --> 02:14:51,170
Yeah!

3325
02:14:54,250 --> 02:14:57,370
Wait, his name is Split Stream Sam, isn't it?

3326
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:58,710
Now that I think about it.

3327
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:02,150
Oh yeah!

3328
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:03,150
Wait...

3329
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:03,910
It is?

3330
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:04,670
Not right.

3331
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:05,470
Am I...

3332
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:06,270
Blanking out?

3333
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:13,560
No!

3334
02:15:14,120 --> 02:15:16,760
It's Jet Stream Sam, you assholes!

3335
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,980
I'm gonna leave.

3336
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:20,240
I'm leaving!

3337
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:22,420
You guys...

3338
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:51,450
Yes...

3339
02:15:51,450 --> 02:15:51,610
I'll...

3340
02:16:44,330 --> 02:16:45,970
I hate you all.

3341
02:16:46,170 --> 02:16:47,690
I hate you all.

3342
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:49,470
I hate you all!

3343
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:50,630
Ahhhh

3344
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:56,290
Oh Tamita!

3345
02:16:57,010 --> 02:16:57,770
Thank you guys...

3346
02:16:57,770 --> 02:16:58,170
For watching!

3347
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:00,510
For hanging out with me...

3348
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:02,510
Except, no thank you.

3349
02:17:04,650 --> 02:17:09,310
I'm deleting the VOD and I'll redo... I'll redo Blade Runner.

3350
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:12,690
It'll be like it never happened.
