1
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,660
Oh, there we go.

2
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,120
I forgot the music.

3
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,810
My, my, boo!

4
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,530
Oh, jeez, go back to the house.

5
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,630
Gochitin'ama, gochitin'ama.

6
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,450
Sorry, my voice is still recovering.

7
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,890
My voice is still recovering.

8
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,950
Napling Choice Awards.

9
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,830
Can you finish the Breaking Bad recap?

10
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,710
Okay, for those who don't know, I was watching Numi's
stream, too, so.

11
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,130
Nimi...

12
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,870
Nimi asked me the other day, she was like, Can you, she
asked me, I think while I was at Hallmat, and I was like, oh

13
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,470
my gosh, she was like, can you do, I'm gonna do like a
halftime show during my not playing choice awards, could you

14
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,610
do a song for it?

15
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,250
And I was like, whoa, of course!

16
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,130
And she was like, just anything that you're comfortable with
singing, she was like, you could sing, snake eater!

17
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,810
You could sing, you could sing, Leve!

18
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,490
You know, anything!

19
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:16,650
I know it just turned New Year's for the UK Happy New Year's
But it's not New Year's yet for me But I was like Can I make

20
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,490
it kind of silly?

21
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,530
She was like yeah And so I was like what if I just
summarized Breaking Bad

22
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,110
That's a song

23
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:40,990
I said season 1 through 3, but actually I kind of stopped
like, oh, oh, the reason I stopped was because I realized I

24
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:49,390
was like, I was singing it, and then I looked over at the
timer, and it was like, five minutes, and I was like, oh,

25
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,150
no!

26
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,270
I was like, wait!

27
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,270
This is getting too long!

28
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,570
So I stopped where I did.

29
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,410
Yeah.

30
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,270
Happy New Year, everybody!

31
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,050
Oh my gosh!

32
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,450
Can you call us?

33
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,310
I will call you.

34
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,990
Happy New Year!

35
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,690
And...

36
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,070
Wisps!

37
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,010
Happy do you!

38
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,910
Ake-o-me-yu timing is difficult, huh?

39
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,090
But...

40
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,490
Yeah, it's all good.

41
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,250
Crediting you for all the insane Breaking Bad edits showing
up on my Twitter feed now.

42
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,250
I've heard that from multiple people, and I'm not quite
sure.

43
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,130
Will I cause a breaking bad renaissance?

44
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,290
Happy Boo Year!

45
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,290
Also, Kmart, thank you so much for the hot guys there, but
thank you.

46
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,470
Happy early New Year, Minto.

47
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,790
Thank you for always being a beacon of joy and positivity in
my life.

48
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,150
I hope everybody is celebrating well and feeling well.

49
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,630
I woke up with my migraine this morning again, and I was
like, no!

50
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,010
And then I went back to sleep for like two more hours, and I
woke up and it was basically gone!

51
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,890
It's a Christmas miracle!

52
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,130
My new year resolution is to watch Minto and be happy.

53
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,530
It goes hand in hand.

54
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,310
I hope I can keep making you guys happy in 2026!

55
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,090
Wow.

56
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh.

57
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,540
Wow, 2026!

58
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Crazy!

59
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,320
Phil, thank you for the walk, I see.

60
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,120
Happy New Year, Minto, and Aibus.

61
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,260
One thing I'm grateful for to 2025 is for introducing me to
your channel.

62
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,780
I hope this year is amazing, and I'm looking forward to all
your hard work individually within the two weeks.

63
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,400
It pay off.

64
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,840
Here's where Freaky Ghost made virtual YouTuber.

65
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Thank you!

66
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,620
Thank you, Phil.

67
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,880
And you went bald.

68
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,610
I'll start watching Breaking Bad again today as well.

69
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,410
Totally forgot it was you who brought it into my mind again.

70
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,930
If someone told me your performance at Nimmy's show was how
I got spoiled on Breaking Bad, I wouldn't have believed

71
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,230
them.

72
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,850
Hey, I only spoiled, like, very early of the show.

73
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,870
I don't know anything that's gonna happen.

74
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,370
I'm on episode 8?

75
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,330
Of...

76
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,030
Whoa, I heard the note of so huge.

77
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:02,750
Sorry, one second.

78
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,350
I'm on episode 8?

79
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,210
I think of...

80
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,270
of...

81
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,970
Season 3?

82
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,790
You could have plugged your ears if you didn't want
spoilers.

83
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,950
I want to rewatch it now.

84
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,190
I can skip to season 3.

85
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,730
No, you have to see all the Skylar drama.

86
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,270
I didn't even bring her up.

87
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,070
Well, you have to see all the Skylar.

88
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,710
Maybe we could do a watch-along for like, the last couple of
episodes or something.

89
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:43,850
like of the seat of the like of the whole show because i've

Did you watch the whole scene of Skylar singing Happy
Birthday?

94
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,960
I did, and I cringed like crazy.

95
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,520
I was like,

96
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,690

97
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,170

Oh.

100
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,270
Gosh, I forgot about that scene.

101
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,870
And I'm reliving the secondhand cringe again.

102
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,490
Making New Year cute talks!

103
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,730
Thank you for haunting my heart in May 26th.

Thank you guys so much!

111
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,090
Oh my gosh!

112
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,730
I'm also in Nimmy's, um, Napling Choice Awards.

113
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,850
Everybody voted.

114
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,730
Even though Loveful was my favorite, as much as I love Ten
Ten, Ten, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go.

115
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:19,930
I was really happy that everybody voted, not everybody, but
a lot of, that won for Nimi's best cover of 2025, so I'm

116
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,250
really happy.

117
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,710
So, yeah.

118
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,450
I'm in the future.

119
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,630
I'll try my best to wake up for Sloppy Sisters.

120
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,550
Oh, my gosh.

121
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:40,430
I, you guys, this stream, so I will be on another stream
tonight with Sloppy Sisters.

122
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,650
Me, Doki, Lai Mu, Snuffy.

123
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,210
And it starts at 1 a.m.

124
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,810
my time.

125
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,330
So I'm wondering if I...

126
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,590
I was gonna, like, stream up until the countdown.

127
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,270
Also, my voice is giving out.

128
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,870
I wonder if I should take a nap before...

129
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,230
Baby.

130
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,750
Well, we'll just have our own countdown.

131
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,090
Don't worry about the time down there.

132
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,010
Happy New Year, I mean, thought we did not start 2025, I'm
expecting to watch VTubers let alone.

133
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,230
Discover my Kami, Mg.

134
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,570
Get up, Mature!

135
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,530
Thank you so much.

136
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,750
Now I can't wait to watch what you intend to accomplish next
year.

137
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,510
Thank you for being my goofy Mg's loving ghost, Oshi.

138
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:25,830
Thank you!

139
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,650
Thank you.

140
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,750
Take that nap, VTuber.

141
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,010
I feel like I should.

142
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,190
I'm already about to y'all.

143
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,110
For those that don't know this game, though, Mint Phantoms,
Freak or Treat.

144
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,370
I, um, me and the team, we made this game, um, together.

145
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,010
Uh, year before, wait, well, no, last year.

146
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,990
It's not 20, 26 just yet.

147
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,470
Last year we made it.

148
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,550
Wait, was it last year?

149
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,010
Yeah, it had to be, because the Christmas update.

150
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,130
So, um...

151
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,910
Yeah, 2024.

152
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,430
Oh my gosh, my brain.

153
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:32,770
And so, it's based off of a game that I used to play a lot
on the Cartoon Network website that was like a

154
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,510
trick-or-treat game that I loved.

155
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,310
So, I based it off of that.

156
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,630
I really wanted it like that.

157
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,330
And I included some of my friends in there.

158
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:50,350
I would love to do another update and include more people
because I've made so many more friends now, so...

159
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,130
I think it would be fun.

160
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,910
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,030
Thank you, guys.

162
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,870
Thank you.

163
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,210
Thanks for another great year with you.

164
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,450
We're so stoked to continue to cheer for you.

165
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,770
Thank you so much.

166
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,350
Thank you.

167
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,510
Happy New Year, Minky.

168
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,270
Thank you.

169
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,490
Hope the courthouse Oshikatsu satisfactory.

170
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,350
Oh my gosh, it was more than...

171
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,330
I can't believe you're... You're crazy!

172
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,470
2025 was a lot, but I'm proud of you for making through it.

173
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,450
Save for wait.

174
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,330
The new year will bring you and then set to Yixi.

175
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,330
Hmm.

176
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,450
You're gonna hit the... Hit the ground running.

177
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,610
There's already... Oh my gosh.

178
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,190
I can already think of things in January.

179
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,030
Excited, excited.

180
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,160
Brendan, welcome to Mambuship.

181
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,720
Thank you.

182
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,520
And Brendan.

183
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,740
Pop back later.

184
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,660
I'll see you later.

185
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,260
Puzzle!

186
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,180
Thank you!

187
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,270
Your streams are always such a joy to tune into.

188
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,790
I'm so glad to have found you this year.

189
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,330
You made me know I was so happy.

190
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,670
Thank you.

191
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,270
I really, sorry, don't have such a crazy thing planned for
New Year's this year.

192
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,290
But, um, honestly, I was just kind of like...

193
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,670
I kind of want to just chill with you guys.

194
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,910
I feel like 2025 was so much already.

195
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,910
and I feel like, you know, we could all just hang out.

196
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,550
It doesn't need to be a big spectacle this time.

197
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:31,950
We can just, you know, we can ring in the new year as a
chill little party.

198
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,230
Spank!

199
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,890
Thank you!

200
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,490
Thank you for the pink.

201
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,070
Looking forward to a new year full of tree frogs and snakes.

202
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:39,490
Wait!

203
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,030
Wait.

204
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,190
Let's just realize something.

205
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,770
losing the year of the snake.

206
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,160
It won't be the year of the snake anymore.

207
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,420
It's gonna be the year of the haunts!

208
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,320
Yeah!

209
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,740
Haunts!

210
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,820
Now, well, thank you so much!

211
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,280
Thank you for that, guys.

212
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,100
I hope you ain't glad to have found you last year, so
remember the first stream I watched.

213
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,240
Wait, what was the first stream?

214
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,180
You have to tell me now.

215
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,460
Thank you so much!

216
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,940
Recycling a thing you can give someone is your time so you
spoil us whether you admit it or not if you say so when is

226
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you!

227
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,300
And thanks for sticking with me throughout the year.

Sorry.

233
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,720
Every time I click out of the thing.

234
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,960
I mean, take a sip in.

235
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,480
Oh, my God.

236
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,700
No, no, no, no.

237
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,920
No more cry.

238
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,020
No more cry.

239
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,080
Oh, my gosh, wait.

240
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:29,800
Oh, no.

241
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,500
Oh, my God.

242
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,020
No, no, no.

243
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,480
I feel the headache coming back.

244
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,140
No, no.

245
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,920
No more cry.

246
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,300
Okay.

247
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,260
Tears be gone.

248
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,140
Okay, we're fine.

249
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,160
Oh, my gosh.

250
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,480
When I cry, I get a headache.

251
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,340
Does anybody else?

252
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,680
Headache be gone.

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,780

254
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,800

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,460
Thank you and all the super chats.

258
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,360
Thank you.

259
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,860
I feel like I'm not going to be able to get to everybody.

260
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh my gosh, Gato.

261
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,440

262
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,300

It's all good, thank you so much for the peek.

267
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,280
Thank you, cars.

268
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,520
Ah, all your New Year's messages, you're gonna make me cry
again.

269
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,160
This is the awesome freak or treat game from last October,
right?

270
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,220
It's the very same.

271
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,180
Cash money robot!

272
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,940
I was watching, I was watching, when I was watching Nimmy's
Napling show, I was like, what are some clips that I would

273
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,240
like?

274
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,600
What are some moments that I think I would highlight
throughout the year?

275
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,160
And I totally thought of you!

276
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,880
I totally thought of that one moment at the end of Journey
where we were like, we were like, who's our partner?

277
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,820
And it just slowly fades in.

278
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,300
Cash money robot.

279
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,660
It was too good.

280
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,740
Yeah, I think it's pink will haunt me forever, pun intended.

281
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,240
Rest in good verse!

282
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,420
Thank you for the pink.

283
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,240
Ladies of the past year and a brighter new one.

284
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm stuck at my parents' house for a while, so thank you for
the sanity restoration too.

285
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,520
I'm now the udon guy and swept in the family card games.

286
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,220
Wait, why the udon guy?

287
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:49,750
Pink.

288
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,010
It's pink.

289
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,410
Was I not wearing this?

290
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:04,210

295
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:30,930
Yes, Nan!

296

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,030
I feel like I have to play it.

299
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,970
Wait, did they say Ace Combat 8 is coming out?

300
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,790
2026, or was it 2027?

301
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,150
I'm wondering if I should play the series before I move or
not.

302
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,610
That's why I'm wondering.

303
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,430
Or did they even give a...

304
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,170
Oh, 2026!

305
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,910
Okay, so I do gotta...

306
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,330
I gotta...

307
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,850
It's probably towards the end of the year.

308
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,110
Happy New Year from the UK!

309
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,630

I'm scrolling up and going through everybody's...

317
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,700
Everybody's super chats reading them.

318
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,880
Thank you so much!

Sorry, guys.

324
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,800
I was just jorking it.

325
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,940
That was, that was, uh, that was metal, not metal gear.

326
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,760
Um, the, the not metal gear.

327
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,260
Un, unmetal?

328
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,020
Wait, what was it?

329
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,310
Or was it Ghost Babble?

330
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,450
That was Ghost Babble, I think.

331
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,030
Ghost Babble?

332
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,930
That makes more sense.

333
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,350
I was like, I think it was a Metal Gear.

334
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:06,130
game but it wasn't metal gear one or two so i don't think it
was unmetal yeah it was ghost babble

335
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:20,710
oh ace gear ghost babble ghost babble is me

Oh, stop!

338
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,200
That one was just me misspeaking.

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,740
Fabius, thank you so much for the pick.

340
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,900

341
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,460

Happiness, wellness, and love.

Yes, yes, yes.

346
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,200
Lifeline was amazing.

347
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,940
Maybe for you guys.

348
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,240
Oh, so many fun memories.

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,280
Oh, yes!

352
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,320
Glad you liked that one too.

353
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
I love coming up with stuff like that.

354
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,740
Just came from Limestream.

355
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,620
I hope you have a great time in your collab later.

356
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,640
Thanks, Copper!

357
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,720
Thank you!

358
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,780
Yeah, we'll see Lyme later.

359
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,600
Was Lifeline really this year?

360
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,460
The bed?

361
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,240
Okay.

362
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,060
The bed?

363
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,360
In her mouth!

364
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,280
In her mouth!

365
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,060
I don't think I could have ever had as much fun as I did
without you in the window.

366
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,740
No!

367
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:07,740
You know, I know that this year, the past couple of years,
honestly, have been a turbulent times for for a lot of

368
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:18,300
youtuber stuff um but honestly you know we're still chugging
along i'm still doing my own minto thing my own minto way um

369
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:29,700
and and you know i i you know obviously we're we're just
streamers at the end of the day most of us at least you know

370
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:37,480
the people that do stream obviously there's gonna be vtubers
that make videos and everything but um i think also what's

371
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:46,060
so special is we're we're a little different than regular
like you know regular streamers because i feel we have these

372
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:56,160
kind of communities that will get together and uh you know i
that's what i really love about being a vtuber is is how how

373
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:07,200
much i'm able to connect you guys and you know you guys are
able to um have Like watch events or go to events or hang

374
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,760
out with people, meet people.

375
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,880
And I just think that's really special.

376
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,840
So especially when it's very easy to be in a digital world
and feel very lonely.

377
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,640
So I'm just really happy that, you know, I feel very...

378
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:37,020
That's like the most... That's what gives me the most
satisfaction is when someone will say, because of you or I I

379
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:47,940
went to this event I would do I can't have it up because of
you things like that so don't get too paranormal I'm

380
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,700
extremely paranormal so

381
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm really happy about that and that's what I want to keep
doing for many many more years to come so i will do my best

382
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:21,500
i think that i booze are the strongest and the nicest and
the most fun and the cutest and everything ever ever

383
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:37,770
but are we the freakiest that too

384
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,260
Get freakier!

385
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,100
Get freakier!

386
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,240
Thank you for the super chat!

387
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,420
Thank you guys!

388
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:52,880
Thank you, thank you!

389
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,600
Sorry, I was on my little... I was on my little spiel.

390
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,460
But thank you so much!

391
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank

392
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,340
Thank you, thank you.

393
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,700
Okay, fine.

394
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Maybe I will.

395
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,300
Happy pull you!

396
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,850
I went back to find the exact moment I became a membo and I
just lost your worst men in MGS Peacewalker and you were so

397
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,310
caring.

398
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,850
Maybe you went to tear you up.

399
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,470
My men, I care so much about them.

400
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,750
Oh my gosh, I'll be worse when I play Phantom Pen.

401
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,890
And here with Minto was a good year.

402
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,710
Whimsy, thank you so much for the fun, gifted.

403
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,190
Thank you.

404
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:41,690
Bye, JD.

405
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,070
Thank you so much for the fun, gifted.

406
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,170
It's really crazy how many names come back and all.

407
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,870
I really appreciate it.

408
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,330
You know, you guys probably, you might, you know, it might
be like, she doesn't know I'm here.

409
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,730
But I know this.

410
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,510
I know this.

411
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,490
Glad your voice has gotten better over the year.

412
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,750
Well, it's pretty bad right now, but it's gotten better over
the year.

413
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,630
For sure.

414
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,170
Marco, thank you so much for the podcasting.

415
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,690
Carvadaji!

416
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,830
Happy birthday!

417
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,830
Happy, happy birthday!

418
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:18,630
Wait.

419
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,850
Two bears, thank you!

420
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,690
Happy early New Year, OPA, but whatever, 2026.

421
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,730
Wait, I feel like I'm just reading all your guys' messages.

422
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,870
Chat, moving so fast.

423
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,830
Mint won't notice.

424
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:38,690
Congratulations.

425
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,870
I boo for life.

426
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,210
Thank you.

427
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,710
Oh, no-no's.

428
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,580
Do we play games here?

429
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,380
There is no such thing as a dumb question.

430
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,820
Oh my gosh, it's already been a half hour, though.

431
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,640
I've just been like, hey, first time chatter here?

432
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,460
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

433
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:12,740
Show.

434
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,400
Oh my gosh, respectable!

435
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,580
Haven't you're still here?

436
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,900
I still can't say your name.

437
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,900
How many years has it been?

438
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,780
I can't say your name at all.

439
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,320
No!

440
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:32,970
Man.

441
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,630
Someone started...

442
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,190
Oh no!

443
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,170
No chance I'm going.

444
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,250
I could say yippee!

445
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,830
But not yippee for your family.

446
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,450
I hope they're okay.

447
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,150
I gave an opportunity to a YouTuber con.

448
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,190
I rarely got to use any con because I'm so shy.

449
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,910
It's nice.

450
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,110
Did Ace Combat cosplay?

451
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,890
Everybody loved the PNG dog.

452
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,130
I mean, JPEG dog.

453
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:53,750
Sorry.

454
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,290
I got his name wrong.

455
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,150
Someone was flying so fast, man won't read that I'm actually
gay.

456
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,130
Congratulations!

457
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,810
I'm almost out of my tea already.

458
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,510
You guys are having me up.

459
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,570
Who is PNG dog?

460
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,350
We don't know him.

461
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,910
That's the cousin.

462
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,610
Oh, I wonder if I'll have my...

463
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,610
I wonder if we'll have that outfit ready for Ace Combat 8
then.

464
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,570
I was talking to Barry yesterday before Colab.

465
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:42,970
And I was telling her that, you know, Sylia is so amazing.

466
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,370
And because she's so amazing, she's also very busy, Sylia
Papa.

467
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:55,610
And so, I was like, I wonder, I wonder.

468
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:02,690
to ask you guys too because um part of i really love
consistency so i was like i think i will only stay with

469
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:10,270
cilia forever and ever as long as i can have her but uh at
the same time i want more than just one outfit a year i

470
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:22,050
think so if i found if i i still need to talk to cilia about
this obviously but if i found another person not another

471
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:31,250
rigor that is that cilia i think could work with or um
vouches for or something like that if i had maybe worked

472
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:43,290
with two people um hopefully i would hope that or i would
aim for that there is not too much difference in how i how i

473
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:52,090
look but um I would like, like I said, I would like to have
more than one outfit a year or so.

474
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,610
He is PNG original, but fan love to call him JPEG.

475
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,270
Yeah, I know.

476
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,610
That's why I call him PNG, because it feels more proper.

477
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,110
But, you're right, he doesn't move.

478
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:06,750
It's so funny.

479
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,870
He's just a good boy.

480
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,210
Thank you for the funny years, James Binto.

481
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,370
I look forward to more fun times from both you and Densitoo.

482
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:13,930
Thank you.

483
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,510
From the gop gop gop gop.

484
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,910
In the blue, I mean the booty shot.

485
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,510
Booty shot.

486
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,630
So many fun games we've done.

487
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,850
Why not webp?

488
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,270
I hope Minto Senpai will notice me, not that I like her or
anything.

489
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,110
Happy New Year!

490
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,430
He's hot too!

491
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,990
Happy New Year!

492
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,430
Ayami would make the costumes too, right?

493
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,030
Of course!

494
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,830
Ayami forever.

495
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,010
As long as Ayami, Mama will have me.

496
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,190
Yes, yes, yes.

497
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,980
I already have...

498
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,220
My next outfit is planned.

499
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
But then I have another one after that.

500
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,600
That is like basically complete.

501
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,640
But obviously I switched the timing on it.

502
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,740
Just don't block her.

503
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,080
I don't!

504
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,800
I don't block her.

505
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,300
I just remember this year, I got dumped.

506
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,080
Mint made it into a clip.

507
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,780
And the eyeballs just kept wishing me good wishes in the
comments, you have an amazing thought.

508
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,570
You were misfortune.

509
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,110
Happy New Year!

510
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:07,030
Wait, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, from France!

511

00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,270

I made it in Photoshop.

523
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,190
All me, baby.

524
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,300
How many OBS scenes you got anyway?

525
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,160
Not that many.

526
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

527
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,960
Only nine.

528
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:38,060
But it's because when I do, like, when I do a, like, a
special stream, I make it as, like, a different, what's the

529
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,340
word?

530
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,240
Scene collection.

531
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,360
I still have, like, a...

532
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,660
Wait, what is the Valentine's one?

533
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,820
What is it?

534
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,920
I know some truly disorganized people.

535
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:54,780
Yeah.

536
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,820
I try to stay organized.

537
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,060
Also, cherry cola.

538
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,900
Thank you!

539
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,940
And my yearly minke tax, please don't send the IBUS on me.

540
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,720
I don't run them.

541
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,300
I don't do have anything to do with them.

542
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,820
Okay.

543
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,680
Shall we play the game, Mom?

544
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,780
This is so...

545
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,300
Wow.

546
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Each costume gives Mint a unique ability.

547
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,160
Use them with space bar to overcome obstacles.

548
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,500
Collect every coin to unlock the next level.

549
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,260
Collect candies for bonus points.

550
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,740
Explore the levels and interact with things that find every
coin and candy.

551
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,740
Starting at the very beginning, baby.

552
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,820
Wait, look at this!

553
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,620
There's so many!

554
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,640
That's me!

555
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,440
Look, look, look.

556
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,420
Lookie, spooky.

557
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,400
Oh wait, that's really weird.

558
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,100
Okay, the reason I didn't play this sooner is because it's
so strange.

559
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,960
Like you?

560
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,920
Hearing my own voice!

561
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,560
It's so weird!

562
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,280
Like I'm not...

563
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,200
Smash, smash!

564
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,560
It's so strange!

565
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,280
And then there's a time limit, you know, so...

566
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,280
Oh my god, the old BGM.

567
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,140
Oh, Maria!

568
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,660
Happy Halloween!

569
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,060
Happy Halloween!

570
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,120
Reggie!

571
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,980
Reggie!

572
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,060
Rime!

573
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,740
I'll see you see Halloween!

574
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,160
I'll see you tonight.

575
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,780
Oh wait, that's a fence.

576
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,620
And look at this side!

577
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,720
I will...

578
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,460
Boo, I must give you a kiss.

579
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,340
Mwah!

580
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,060
Big energy!

581
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,500
Cute fairy costume.

582
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,550
So that's how the game goes.

583
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,510
But people were saying that like the further levels are
pretty difficult.

584
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:17,910
So...

585
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,530
I'm excited.

586
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,050
Yay.

587
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:31,510
And then I had lots of help from good team for making all
the music and everything.

588
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,250
Yeah.

589
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,810
It was an ordeal, but it was a lot of fun.

590
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,410
Froggy.

591
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,270
Froggy.

592
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,710
Wait, is this a... Oh, we can go this way.

593
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,230
Hello.

594
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,310
You're in the way.

595
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:42,490
Ashton!

596
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,510
Bonfire!

597
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,510
How fun!

598
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,590
They got a really good voice actor for this game.

599
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,730
She sounds spot on.

600
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,650
I know, right?

601
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,350
Like, crazy.

602
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,750
And then look!

603
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,350
And look at the...

604
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,350
sneaky boxes?

605
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,890
Who's my star?

606
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,550
It's just so cute.

607
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,230
Everything's so cute.

608
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,950
Big energy!

609
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,380
Dead thing.

610
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:35,290
I sprinkled my fairy dust on these they're extra special
what's she mean where it comes from what's she mean by that

611
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:46,630

614
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,060
Why did she say that to us?

615
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,700
Like, seriously.

616
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,640
What the hell, Berrybug?

617
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,980
I played the game.

618
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,300
This was based on, as a kid.

619
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:18,980
Happy New Year.

620
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,360
Yeah!

621
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,180
Thank you, Vanilla.

622
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,140
She's weird.

623
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,080
Just ignore her.

624
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,620
I think we should, honestly.

625
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,160
Like, such a weirdo.

626
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,020
Mawikung, mawikung.

627
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,780
Wait, can I get through here?

628
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,000
Am I...

629
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,500
I need to...

630
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,700
I need to smash.

631
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,500
It's like energy.

632
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,920
Where's the smash?

633
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,060
We need to smash.

634
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,400
Where is...

635
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,040
Oh, there's smash.

636
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,960
There's smash.

637
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,260
I just ran right past it.

638
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,680
You gotta smash things because sometimes there will be candy
in there.

639
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,460
Bye, Kim.

640
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,480
Wait.

641
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,380
Smash.

642
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,360
Smash.

643
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,360
Oh, wait.

644
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,120
Bye, Kim.

645
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,460
Kiss.

646
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,580
Kiss.

647
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,020
Kiss!

648
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,540
Isn't that so nice?

649
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,660
I thought of you guys.

650
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,120
Just kissing you all.

651
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,920
And then you get so happy you go to heaven.

652
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,120
Isn't that so exciting?

653
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,140
This game is bringing back memories of waiting for Flash
Game Solo because my parents had died.

654
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,120
Spooky.

655
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,080
That old, huh?

656
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,380
Like you?

657
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:30,700
Wait.

658
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,800
Spooky.

659
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,820
There we go.

660
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,140
Here, have some candy.

661
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,800
Like you?

662
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,680
Why'd she say that?

663
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,700
Spooky.

664
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,660
I love all the animations and everything.

665
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,660
Everybody did such a good job.

666
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,920
It's so cute.

667
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,240
I think this is our last guy, no?

668
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,240
Spooky.

669
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,360
Wait, we gotta...

670
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,440
Oh.

671
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,280
No.

672
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,020
We must become...

673
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,700
We must become made!

674
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,300
Makyum.

675
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,740
Tainwaianyu!

676
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,620
Thank you!

677
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,620
Big Minki now!

678
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,920
Thank you for being so uplifting this year!

679
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,280
Of course!

680
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,160
What the heck?

681
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,040
What the heck?

682
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,780
What the heck?

683
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,140
Phoenix bites and fright?

684
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,400
I love Phoenixes.

685
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,020
Minky, Minky, but what?

686
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,940
What is something that you...

687
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,180
Oh!

688
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,080
Trick or treat, you stinky.

689
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,280
Geary!

690
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,660
What is something that you did this year that was, like, a
lot of fun?

691
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,400
Doesn't have to be VTuber related.

692
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,420
Anything, anything.

693
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,720
I just want to hear all the trouble you got into.

694
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,560
Geary, grandma.

695
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,300
Off Kai.

696
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,900
Second trip to Japan.

697
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,840
Went to all-for-one.

698
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,920
Watching Mint.

699
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,020
Come on.

700
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,860
I don't answer.

701
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,760
Korea for the first time.

702
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,840
I've been thinking about, like, doing that.

703
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,400
Did I still have the cruise?

704
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:30,320
Not cruise, but, like, the boat from Japan to Korea.

705
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,120
I've been thinking.

706
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,280
I was like, I mean, I go to Japan so often.

707
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,740
Maybe...

708
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,420
Oh, my God.

709
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,760
This map is huge.

710
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,680
What was I thinking?

711
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,760

00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,360
Okay, wait.

730
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,940

732
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,260

00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,280
For each effect.

741
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,140

Give me a little hat and the right thing.

744
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:40,580
It was over a year ago, but I still think of all the time in
planning that went into this game.

745
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,800
Craziness.

746
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,740
Doop, doop, doop, doop.

I don't even know my own game.

775
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,500
To be fair.

776
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,300
Oh, my gosh.

777
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,180

You guys, I finally, finally got the goods from...

784
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,820
This is going to sound so bad.

785
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:11,740
I finally got goods from the podcast that Matara and I did.

786
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,520

787
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:15,980

00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,080
And I got a package from her.

789
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:26,200
And I was like looking at, I was like, How the hell did she
package this?

790
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,180
Like energy.

791
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,280

792
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,040

Push, push!

796
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,880
Are those postcards still happening?

797
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,620
You know...

798
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,640
I...

799
00:48:51,640 --> 00:49:02,440
Matara got so busy and I got so busy, still have all of them
uh i have i have a thousand of them signed and then need to

800
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:14,480
sign a thousand more of like the the last ones matara tried
to find a way to um get the refunds for everybody for the

801
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:22,000
last two months for it because we were like we are so busy
we're not gonna have time to meet up that many yeah that's

802
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,100
why it was like a that's why it was really difficult for us
to do the last two batches because we ended up getting so

803
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:40,520
busy and then my hand was like becoming jelly um but so
matara tried to find a way to refund everybody and then

804
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:49,980
maybe we would give the postcards away at like an event or
something um but since i still have them i would like to

805
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,380
send them out before I move.

806
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,120
So I wanted to talk to Matara again and

807
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,520
have her help me with it.

808
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,260
Or rather, like, see if she's in a position to be able to.

809
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,980
So, it's not that we're like...

810
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,760
It's not that we were like, oh no, we're just gonna, like,
drop this forever.

811
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,560
Like, in the behind the scenes, we've been trying to figure
out what to do.

812
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,220
So...

813
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,860
Yeah, yeah.

814
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:27,980
Um...

815
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,620
We're just trying to figure out what to do, basically.

816
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,980
I hope nothing shipped to me yet.

817
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:35,720
No?

818
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,100
We haven't shipped anything.

819
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,060
But yeah.

820
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,560
Can you call us pathetic and sad again?

821
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,640
Why?

822
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,400
Do you really like that?

823
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,780
Well yeah, I do apologize that like the last two months of
the Patreon drawn stuff.

824
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,180
It became pretty overwhelming because it was you know, just
her and I handling everything.

825
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,900
but it's no excuse, obviously.

826
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,080
and I still would like to wait, what am I looking for?

827
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm looking for froggy.

828
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,780
I would still like to obviously finish everything.

829
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:10,900
Where was he?

830
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:11,480
Over here?

831
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,600
Wait, I think I can fly up here.

832
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:17,740
Instead.

833
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,140
These walls keep me down.

834
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,440
Nope, that's not froggy.

835
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,100
I love the gnome.

836
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:26,980
It's so cute.

837
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,180
Wait, there's a trash can here!

838
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,660
Oh my god.

839
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,980
Oh my god.

840
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,180
Oh!

841
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,180
I do have Iboos left to shoot.

842
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:36,740
You're right.

843
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,680
I should get them too.

844
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,080

845
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:43,940
Mawikung.

846
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,280
Love the gnome.

847
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,200
haircut sticking out of the hat.

848
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,040
What do you mean by that?

849
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,400
Wait, it looks exactly...

850
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,480
Wait, doesn't it...

851
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,520
Doesn't it look exactly at what I'm wearing right now?

852
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,640
Wait a second!

853
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,180
Wait, it looks exactly...

854
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,180
Wait, this is messed up!

855
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,990
There was somebody sad and pathetic up here.

856
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,670
Where are you, poor little eyeball?

857
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:24,210

Just kidding, I got you already.

859
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,190

You!

861
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,050

891
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:11,290
Reggie.

892
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:11,710
Reggie.

893
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:14,650
Alright.

894
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,730
To the pond!

895
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,890
I sure hope I didn't forget anything.

896
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:22,790
You guys can backseat me if you're like, You forgot the
thing!

897
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,010
We're missing two!

898
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,570
Uh-oh, we're missing two candies, guys.

899
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,610
Where?

900
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:36,250
Where?

901
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,330
Where could they be?

902
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,470
There's a trash can behind the lamp.

903
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,610
There's this poor pathetic soul right here.

904
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:45,710
Alright, that's one.

905
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:47,870
And this trash can may be.

906
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:48,630
Is that the one?

907
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,210
Wow.

908
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:52,250
Hidden.

909
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,770
This is 100% run.

910
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,130
It's more like...

911
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,190
Whoops, I went to the wrong one.

912
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,370
It's more like you can't complete it.

913
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,390
You can't move on unless you 100%.

914
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:08,630
Smash!

915
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,570
Where was, uh...

916
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,510
Where was my actual outfit, though?

917
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:17,640
Literally...

918
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,680
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

919
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:23,960
You!

920
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,720
Okay!

921
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,460
That means the eye blue is literally the last one!

922
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:28,980
Wait.

923
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,800
Where did I leave her?

924
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,740
Up here?

925
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:33,420
Please.

926
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,080
Yes!

927
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,260
Thank you!

928
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,600
We've done it!

929
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,540
My mouse is on the screen.

930
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,140
I know.

931
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,740
It's like a mosquito.

932
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,690
Alright, graveyard gathering.

933
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,250
And then we'll move on to a spooky neighborhood too.

934
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,710
And there's a reward if you complete all of these things.

935
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,490
I remember doing all these first games.

936
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,310
Or the first levels.

937
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:17,830
I've done all of these ones.

938
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:20,490
But...

939
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:28,610
I don't think I did the new levels, so that will be all new
to me.

940
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,250
How many levels are there?

941
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,450
Exactly what you see.

942
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,870
Smash!

943
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,510
Big energy!

944
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,910
Smash!

945
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,250
When did the new levels come out?

946
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,350
They came out Christmas last year.

947
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,190
Big energy!

948
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:53,330
So, we're about a year old.

949
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:54,970
But, you know.

950
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:56,590
Oh, let's go get...

951
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,090
Let's go get Froggy.

952
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,830
What you say is what you get.

953
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:05,990
Froggy.

954
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,260
Is she saying big?

955
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,420
What is she saying?

956
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,980
She says big energy.

957
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,440
Oh!

958
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,120
Another somebody that I'm...

959
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,660
Hanging out with tonight.

960
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,700
Here's some candy.

961
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,120
Why she say it like that?

962
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,620
Here's some candy.

963
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,280
Big energy.

964
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,540
Why she say it like that?

965
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,500
Doki bird.

966
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:40,640
Like you?

967
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:46,640
Oh, she put razor blades.

968
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,400
Yeah, she did.

969
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,260
Rise up lights.

970
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,700
Rise up lights.

971
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,160
Raise up lights.

972
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,680
Raise up lights.

973
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:55,740
Rise up.

974
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,840
Rise up lights.

975
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,220
Rise up.

976
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,540
Rise up lights.

977
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,260
Rise up lights.

978
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,340
What am I saying?

979
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,500
Razor Blades or Rise up lights?

980
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,500
You'll never know.

981
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,180
What could I be saying?

982
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,940
What could I be saying?

983
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,820
Who are you making fun of Vicky?

984
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,440
If Vicky were, um...

985
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,820
Australian.

986
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,180
Spooky.

987
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,300
Okay.

988
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,040
Rise up, light!

989
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,580
You can't tell at all!

990
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,780
You can't, you can't.

991
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,860
Don't pretend you can.

992
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,350
She's not...

993
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,150
See, you can't even do...

994
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,430
You can't even pretend that like...

995
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,230
Oh, Vicky is not...

996
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:57,110
British when she's like so painfully British.

997
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:01,010
You can't even be like, I thought she was Australian.

998
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,350
There's literally no way you could ever think that.

999
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,130
Also, game devs...

1000
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,530
I would like to report harassment.

1001
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
Niro-sama!

1002
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,760
Trick or treat.

1003
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,940
Trick or treat.

1004
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,660
Niro-sama.

1005
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,740
Where is the smash?

1006
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,340
Harassment for what?

1007
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,000
For my eyes is all.

1008
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,300
Wait, do we have to become fairy?

1009
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:45,800
I think so.

1010
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,560
Where was fairy?

1011
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,280
Fairy was last seen over here.

1012
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:55,260
Oh.

1013
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,360
Smash.

1014
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,400
Yeah, I invited a bunch of people.

1015
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,120
Big energy to join in my game.

1016
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:26,060
I was really surprised how many people said yes honestly I
was like whoa thanks for being in my game I love the I love

1017
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:38,760
the summoning circle of candy smash smash why would they not
I don't know I mean like if they're busy not interested

1018
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,380
Hello!

1019
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,220
But it's also fun to see...

1020
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,400
Whoops, I just realized I didn't get that one.

1021
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:56,660
It's fun to see how many people I'm like, Oh, my friends!

1022
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,220
It's my friends, my friends!

1023
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,280
You know?

1024
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,360
I think there was nothing up here.

1025
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,540
I vaguely remember a few couldn't, but so many became a part
of it anyway.

1026
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:11,640
Yeah!

1027
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,780
Now I'm like, who else?

1028
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,840
You know, there's so many more people I could have bought.

1029
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,100
Which would be nice.

1030
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,200
Another update.

1031
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,220
Maybe like a...

1032
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,220
Maybe we could do...

1033
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,280
Because we did a Christmas update.

1034
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:27,780
We could do a summer update.

1035
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,480
The spring update?

1036
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:29,700
Summer update?

1037
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,240
Something.

1038
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,200
Oh, sad, sad.

1039
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:44,070
But...

1040
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:45,250
It was all, you know.

1041
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,290
It was all just for fun.

1042
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:53,610
I never, you know.

1043
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,040
For things like this.

1044
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,560
You kind of just do it because you want to.

1045
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,780
Not because it's like a...

1046
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,000
I mean, there's no way I can make my money back on this.

1047
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,440
It doesn't make any money.

1048
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:13,880
Yeah.

1049
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,320
Lifeguard Nimi.

1050
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,580
Wait, that would be great for a summer one.

1051
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,200
Oh my gosh.

1052
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,280
Wait, you're so right.

1053
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,880
You're right.

1054
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:27,620
Microtransactions.

1055
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,100
Oh my gosh, it could be pay to win.

1056
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:38,380
Send me a super chat right now and I'll give you a cheat
code that you can type in that will help you win the level.

1057
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,400
Do we need the froggy again?

1058
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:50,320
Or it will be like you send the super chat.

1059

01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:31,670
Do you not?

1064
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,810
Do you hate me or something?

1065
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,290
I'm trying to send a kiss and you're like, no.

I'll only give you candy if you dress up as a werewolf.

1071
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:49,510
You heard the lady.

1072
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,330
Well, I think these are all good.

1073
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:59,250
Okay, we have all the coins.

1074
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:00,850
I need one cat!

1075
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:01,250
Oh, wait.

1076
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,070
I think it was that sad, pathetic guy.

1077
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,390
The poor, poor guy was our last one.

1078
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,130
One cheat code, please.

1079
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,210
This is literally a walkthrough, everybody.

1080
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:12,270
Oh, no.

1081
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:12,750
Not again.

1082
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:13,350
Oh, no.

1083
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,150
My buddy.

1084
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,510
I'm not looking for a cheat code.

1085
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,150
I just want to super chat.

1086
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,810

1094
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,490
She's hogging all the cheat codes.

1095
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:12,570
Okay, hold on.

1096
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:13,330

1097
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,270
I turn off.

1098
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,090
I turn off.

1099
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:16,750
I turn off.

1100
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:17,470
I turn off.

1101
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,670
where is it?

1102
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:20,030
Super chat.

1103
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,890
I understand.

1104
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,010
YouTube is so funny about this.

1105
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:27,750
They're like, if you continue, your fans will no longer see
super chat as an option.

1106
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,770
and you will no longer earn revenue.

1107
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:32,670
I understand the implications of this action.

1108
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,790
Turn off.

1109
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,210
Turn off.

1110
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:39,850
There we go.

1111
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,040
Thank you, doll.

1112
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,000
Thank you, thank you.

1113
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,660
Oh my gosh, frog for death.

1114
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,040
You might be the last super chat.

1115
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,260
Thank you.

1116
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,160
Thank you so much.

1117
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,800
Don't cry over not being able to send me money.

1118
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,760
What is wrong with you?

1119
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,520
Free me.

1120
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,120
Wait, how did you send that?

1121
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,120
How did you just send that?

1122
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:06,660
Oh my gosh.

1123
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:07,520
Zeno Fala!

1124
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,840
Thank you so much for the...

1125
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,240
See you, bro.

1126
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,260
Rise Knight!

1127
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:20,160
Stop!

1128
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:28,260
I can't turn these off.

1129
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,500
I can't turn off the memberships.

1130
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:30,600
Do I go, thank you!

1131
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,460
Burn and thank you.

1132
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,100
Oh my god.

1133
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,700
Everything is green.

1134
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,500
I do not see.

1135
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,560
I close my eyes and I pretend not to see.

1136
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,920
But I have to squint a little.

1137
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,380
I have to see a little bit.

1138
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,740
So that I can play the game.

1139
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,320
Wait, I think it's over here.

1140
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,040
So much green.

1141
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:55,900
Green women.

1142
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,780

Okay, this should be the last one.

1158
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,240

Thank you, Oimo, for your art.

1163
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,600
Thank you for playing our silly little game!

1164
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,940
May your Halloween be filled with more treats than tricks!

1165
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,500
Happy Halloween!

1166
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,320
But we still have more games to play.

1167
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,760
We still have neighborhood too.

1168
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,440
Which this is all new to me.

1169
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,880
I don't remember if they asked me if I should check the game
or not.

1170
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,000
I wonder if I lied and said that I did.

1171
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,040
I wonder if I was like, yep, looks good.

1172
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:14,920
I wonder.

1173
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:30,090
I mean it does look good Don't make that face Spooky
Foxblade, don't make that face Why are you making that face?

1178
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,400
Very good.

1179
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,600

1180
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,760
Oh, I keep trying to go between this car.

1181
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,380

Come here, baby.

1185
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:12,740
Come here.

1186
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,960
Is there anybody else up here?

1187
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,860
Solid recap.

1188
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,100
It was Freaking epic.

1189
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:27,580
Nome.

1190
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,260
Dang it, no no froggy.

1191
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,400
I think I need to smash a little bit more.

1192
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,020
No I do not.

1193
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,240
It's such a good sound effect.

1194
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,620
We need to...

1195
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,100
Oh, okay.

1196
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,300
There is a sad guy down here.

1197
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,400
Poor little pathetic fella.

1198
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,040
Do you have any fun collabs planned for today?

1199
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,660
I bet I do.

1200
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,360
You can catch me later.

1201
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,600

1202
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:06,420

01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,320

01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,020

1206
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:14,560
In five hours on Doki Bird Channel.

1207
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,160
Where we will be in VR chat.

1208
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,620
And there might be some special stuff as well.

1209
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,080
So you should...

1210
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,240
Oh my gosh, I did it again.

1211
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,340
You should come watch and hang out with us.

1212
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,380
Hey, Ham, thank you!

1213
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,060
You have a 2 a.m.

1214
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,480
collab?

1215
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,420
Well, for me, it's 1 a.m.

1216
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:40,880
But yeah.

1217
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,640
I do, yeah.

1218
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,220
Alright, we grab him.

1219
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,520
We'll go get the key because there's two keys we gotta
unlock.

1220
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,500
We must become spooky.

1221
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,740
Gosh, Doki, what are you doing up there?

1222
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,320
Why are you so...

1223
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,420
So out of the way.

1224
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,040
Where did I leave the spooky?

1225
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:02,780
Yeah.

1226
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:03,720
Spooky.

1227
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:04,760
Spooky.

1228
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,740
Don't fall asleep.

1229
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:07,460
I know.

1230
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,380
I'm already like, oh geez.

1231
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,880
Am I going to fall asleep during this?

1232
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,480
I have to be high energy because it's VR chat.

1233
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,660
So I think I'll take a nap.

1234
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,740
Don't get sick from VR.

1235
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,500
That's another thing I have to not do.

1236
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,300
I know.

1237
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:25,380
I was just like...

1238
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,640
I'll try and stay for as long as I can.

1239
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:41,740
Obviously, I'd like to stay for the whole collab, but if I
start feeling so bad, it kind of can't be helped, but she

1240
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,620
was like, were you just raw-dogging your long streams like
that?

1241
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,400
And I was like, yes.

1242
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,400
I was.

1243
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,800
Okay, there's a lot to smash here.

1244
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,320
Okay.

1245
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:02,090
I hear...

1246
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:02,590
Smash!

1247
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,930
I hear...

1248
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,150

1249
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,210

1252
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,120
Do you guys do fireworks for New Year's?

1253
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,890

Thank you!

1256
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,490
That's why I was like...

1257
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,370
I could...

1258
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,370
Do a stream...

1259
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:38,370
On big energy!

1260
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:39,590
New Year's Day!

1261
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:42,690

1262
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:48,010
So, I, don't you worry, you're pretty little head.

1263
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:48,690
Trick or treat.

Oh, by the way, I'm inside your home.

1265
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,250

Yeah!

1274
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:55,660
I always spend New Year's at a relative's place except once.

1275
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:02,160
And now, I, you know, someone, I was talking to a friend
today, and they were like, you're working tonight.

1276
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,840
I was like, I was like, why are you working on New Year's
Eve?

1277
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,440
That's so silly.

1278
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,680
And they were like, you're working tonight.

1279
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,640
And I was like, well, I don't feel like I'm working.

1280
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:16,920
I feel like I'm, you know, keeping people company because,
I'm not doing I'm not hanging out with anybody I'm just I'm

1281
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:28,580

people too that aren't hanging out with anybody so we're

1282
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:32,120
we're just hanging out if

1283
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:46,720
it was my rotation I'd be working it I'm after all or so you
get probably the big money for working new years right Heck

1284
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,500

1285
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,500
Spooky maze.

1286
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,560
Spooky maze.

1287
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,480
Wait, this is really a maze.

1288
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,420
Out the way, out the way.

1289
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,920
Got paid for New Year's.

1290
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,100
Nice.

1291
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,600
Do we have some people getting bonuses?

1292
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:11,420
Yeah.

1293
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,660

1294
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:16,480

01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:17,820

1296
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:20,700
Oops.

1297
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,060
I made that guy turn around.

1298
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,120
Oh no, they were buddies.

1299
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,080
Okay, we're gonna have to smash some.

1300
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:38,000
I got a nice Christmas bonus.

1301
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:39,480
Yippee!

1302
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:44,150
Kiwi.

1303
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,790
Trick or treat, you stinky.

1304
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,330
I think I need to go smash.

1305
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,150
I am unemployed.

1306
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,750
That's okay, too.

1307
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:07,150
I'm so work brand It's just, you know It comes from when I
was in Oh well, okay

1308

01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:16,390
Yes Smash

1310
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:22,830
How can we buy Minto merch if unemployed?

1311
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:25,430
That should not be your top priority.

1312
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:26,890
Don't say that.

1313
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:29,010
Don't say that.

1314
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,050
It could make me angry.

1315
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:40,230
I don't know, I just want you guys to eat yummy on a holiday
like this, you know?

1316
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:41,450
Maria!

1317
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:44,530
Trick or treat!

1318
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,250
Trick or treat!

1319
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:47,890
So cute.

1320
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,150
Addicted to merch.

1321
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,750
Oh my god, that's one time I change over.

1322
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:03,350
There's... I thought I got all the doors!

1323
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:04,550
No!

1324
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,090
Truly an angel.

1325
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:08,670
Meow.

1326
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:10,750
Wee.

1327
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:15,550
I'm making cowboy steaks at bacon mac and cheese.

1328
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:17,570
What is a cowboy steak?

1329
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:19,950
What is that?

1330
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,530
What makes it different from a regular steak?

1331
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:24,970
Cowboy steak.

1332
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,890
Okay, fairy is down here.

1333
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,050
Probably will be the last thing we do.

1334
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,130
Trick or treat.

1335
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,730
It's made of cowboys.

1336
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,010
What part of the cowboy?

1337
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:45,550
What part of the cowboy is it made out of?

1338
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:46,610
Oh, this is scary.

1339
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,690
Does it have a cowboy hat?

1340
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:51,630
The rump.

1341
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,190
Juicy tender.

1342
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:58,470
The boy part.

1343
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,640
Alright, let's go get that spooky alley!

1344
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,580
It's made from the hat.

1345
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,680
I'm getting a whole lot.

1346
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,360
Okay, some of you guys have, like, obviously, like, regional
recipes or something.

1347
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,060
Because I'm getting all sorts of different answers here.

1348
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,160
I guess in some households, they...

1349
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,060
Wait, I'm lost?

1350
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,660
Regional differences, yeah.

1351
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:28,640
Yeah, clearly.

1352
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,560
Wait, oh, God.

1353
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,660
Get out of the way!

1354
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,060
Get out of the way!

1355
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,040
It's over here.

1356
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:37,940
Yes.

1357
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:38,800
Yes.

1358
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,710
Lots of stakeable parts of the cowboy.

1359
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,010
Sounds like it.

1360
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:50,630
I'll have to...

1361
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:52,150
Where could I acquire?

1362
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:56,730
Do I go to my local outback and say, Give me one...

1363
01:20:58,430 --> 01:20:59,010
Boy.

1364
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:00,810
Give me it.

1365
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,510
How do you cook them?

1366
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:04,570
You ketchup.

1367
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:08,010
Now that sounds like a lot of work.

1368
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:11,690
Gary.

1369
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:14,990
One boy.

1370
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:16,250
Hold the cow.

1371
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,560
Okay, this is to fairy.

1372
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:28,500
I think we have one more poor Aibu to kiss.

1373
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:31,220
Yeah.

1374
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,860
Guys, this is what would happen if I kissed you.

1375
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,620
You would dissolve.

1376
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,820
Alright, that should be all of them.

1377
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,080
You would dissolve and be so sad.

1378
01:21:47,160 --> 01:22:02,900
Worth it It's true, I'm melting I want to dissolve I imagine
it being like the The big energy The, um, what's the words

1379
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:15,800
Like the You know those videos of the raccoons That wash the
That wash their Cotton candy And then they're like Where to

1380
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,140

1381
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,420
Where to go?

1382
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,120
Where to go?

1383
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,110
That's what I imagined.

1384
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:28,530
Doodle-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1385
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,210
Poor raccoon.

1386
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:39,170
Yeah, but you have to admit it's pretty funny.

1387
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:40,330
What are we missing?

1388
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:43,190
Okay, we're missing quite a bit of candy candy.

1389
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,430
Where?

1390
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:48,010
Hmm.

1391
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,510
Oh, here's one.

1392
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:54,830
If I were a candy candy, where would I be?

1393
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,670
You would be so sad to dissolve us.

1394
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:01,270
I would!

1395
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,490
I would be so sad.

1396
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:07,950
I talked to Garia in my belly.

1397
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:08,410
Wait!

1398
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:09,790
Here's one.

1399
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:12,950
You passed one in the middle.

1400
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:14,230
Other?

1401
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:16,630
Oh!

1402
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:17,170
Oh!

1403
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,000
Now we're missing just one.

1404
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,660
Uh-oh.

1405
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,440
That's like the worst, and we're almost out of time.

1406
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,320
There's one near Geary?

1407
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:39,510
Bee!

1408
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:46,790
Haunted Cemetery.

1409
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:50,210
Whoa.

1410
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,010
Whoa.

1411
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:52,650
It really is a cemetery.

1412
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,050
Whoa.

1413
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:01,760
Happy New Year, Minto!

1414
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,740
Happy New Year!

1415
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,380
What thing?

1416
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,300
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1417
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,140
Because I was gone for so much of like...

1418

Kiwawa!

1419
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,860
I think she was one of the people I tried initially to get.

1420
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,480
Triven says, thank you!

1421
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:30,600
Thank you for always haunting everyone bringing joy and
laughter through your stream singing and other activities.

1422
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,940
Riding Idol made the new year.

Thank you!

1426
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,480
It's so funny.

1427
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,100
Because usually you always donate at like the end of the
stream.

1428
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,600
And I appreciate it so much.

1429
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,600
And I'm just like, oh.

1430
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,960
There's the Tri-Princess donation.

1431
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,220
Feels like the end of the stream.

1432
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,480
I don't mean that in a way to be like.

1433
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,440
Okay, you gotta keep it up.

1434
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,900
It's just kind of like a...

1435
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,500
Oh yeah.

1436
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:05,760
There it is.

1437
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,360
Smash!

1438
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,460
Spooky.

1439
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,520
Spooky.

1440
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,960
But um, because I was gone for like the...

1441
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,440
The, um...

1442
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,660
Holidays and stuff.

1443
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,820
One thing I didn't get...

1444
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,020
Was a pumpkin pie.

1445
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,240
I didn't get pumpkin pie.

1446
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:35,700
And, and while I was in Japan, one thing I was desperately
trying to find, was just some dang gingerbread.

1447
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,420
I just want...

1448
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,200
They don't have any gingerbread.

1449
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:45,000
So if anybody is in Japan and knows where to get
gingerbread, please tell me.

1450
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,880
I think it's still time, right, for me to be able to get
pumpkin pie?

1451
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:50,740
Probably right.

1452
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:58,900
I went to a Christmas market and I searched everywhere and
could not find any...

1453
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,100
any gingerbread.

1454
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:02,940
Do you like gingerbread?

1455
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,680
Yes!

1456
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,400
Oh my gosh, I love ginger snaps!

1457
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,960
And I love ginger snaps the most with milk.

1458
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,500
Smash.

1459
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,760
It's... Oh wait.

1460
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,720
Let's go get this guy.

1461
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,860
I love me a ginger snap with the milk.

1462
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,520
So good.

1463
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,720
Reggie.

1464
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:26,840
Hmm.

1465
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,460
Best combo for sure.

1466
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:29,120
I agree.

1467
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,040
They're great with chai too.

1468
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,560
I can believe that.

1469
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,520
100%.

1470
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,740
I can definitely believe that.

1471
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:39,800
Ginger chew candies.

1472
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:40,660
Raggy.

1473
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,840
Usually ginger is like kind of too...

1474
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,760
It's too spicy for me.

1475
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,580
Let's hear Wawa.

1476
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:53,700
Merry Kitty Christmas.

1477
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:56,800
Smash.

1478
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,540
I remember now.

1479
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,500
I was like, Kiwawa, do you want to be in my Halloween game?

1480
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,840
And she sent her audio...

1481
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,080
Through like Discord.

1482
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:12,360
Wait, where's the last coin?

1483
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,660
Oh, there it is.

1484
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,540
So the quality is kind of funny.

1485
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:23,740
Hot dog indeed.

1486
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,060
Uh-oh.

1487
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,720
We're missing the candy candy.

1488
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:30,840
Oh, wait.

1489
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,920
I'm too good.

1490
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,500
Josh, thank you.

1491
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:43,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

1492
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,860
Keep up, we're almost done.

1493
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,080
Wait, we have one more!

1494
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,080
And then we can play Mind Sweeper.

1495
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,360
She's just too good at her own game.

1496
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:01,380
I know.

1497
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:08,680
This is, this is the, this is the true um, tutorial.

1498
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:15,780
Oh, getting this game done, baby.

1499
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,980
Mama, happy Halloween!

1500
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:23,540
Push, push, push, push.

1501
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:29,150
Smash!

1502
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:30,070
Smash!

1503
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,270
No Christmas levels.

1504
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:35,070
Well, they were like Christmas fad.

1505
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,990
But we did add extra levels.

1506
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:39,710
Yeah, yeah.

1507
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:40,850
Does it smash?

1508
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:41,310
No.

1509
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:42,950
I think I tried that before too, even.

1510
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:56,290
yeah they were christmas-fied a little bit i got my hat and

1513
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:20,830
Oh!

1514
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:22,590
I need to become spooky again.

1515
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:29,590
I don't watch Twitch very often.

1516
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,770
So when she started cross-streaming, I was like...

1517
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:33,170
Spooky!

1518
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,130
Oh my god, finally.

1519
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:38,110
Saba and Dubi?

1520
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:38,830
Oh yeah!

1521
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,690
Dubi would be really great to add too!

1522
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:42,450
Yeah!

1523
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,030
And Saba.

1524
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:47,130
I haven't been able to talk to her so much.

1525
01:29:47,230 --> 01:29:48,030
Just a little bit.

1526
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:52,430
She's very, very nice.

1527
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:53,970
Sabah is.

1528
01:29:54,710 --> 01:29:55,970
I hope her health is okay.

1529
01:29:56,410 --> 01:30:01,550
I saw that she said she would be streaming somewhere come
2026.

1530
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:02,910
So I'm excited about that.

1531
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:07,530
Because, I don't know, there's just something so relaxing
about watching her and her voice and everything.

1532
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:09,910
So I really like watching her.

1533
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:17,190
Phoebe and Vicky!

1534
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:18,510
Oh my gosh, that's a total given!

1535
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:19,870
Of course.

1536
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:23,770
You see, like I said, there's so many more people I can add
now.

1537
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:25,890
Oh.

1538
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:31,010
I'm excited, like, to be able to add so many more people.

1539
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,130
Okay, that's for the eyeball.

1540
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:35,070
Happy Halloween!

1541
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:38,830
I sprinkled my fairy dust on these, so they're extra
special.

1542
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:39,730
Extra special.

1543
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:41,030
Oh, that's where it comes from.

1544
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:42,170
Mm-mm.

1545
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:44,350
Got beasties!

1546
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:45,290
Oh my gosh.

01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:47,530
Wait, I'm gonna have to bake like...

1549
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:52,970
Where?

1550
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:58,310
Where was I getting?

1551
01:30:58,810 --> 01:30:59,250
What was I getting?

1552
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:00,030
I don't remember.

1553
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,770
Wait.

She's so real for that.

1581
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:26,420
What could go wrong?

1582
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:31,980
Surely none of the people that would be invited would ever,
ever get cancelled.

1583
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:33,460
Ever.

1584
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,460
Not on my watch.

1585
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,780
I mean, they're in a steamed game freak retreat.

1586
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,400
They must keep up appearances.

1587
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,400
They can't just be going off willy-nilly.

1588
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:45,400
Ashton!

1589
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:46,620

1602
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,760
So much content.

1603
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:46,760
Oh, for free.

1604
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:47,820
Free DLC.

1605
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,140
Look at the eyeball with the Santa hat.

1606
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:51,920
It's too cute.

1607
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,420
There's Henya, yeah.

1608
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:01,960
We'll go steal.

1609
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:02,340
Wait.

1610
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:08,770
And then...

1611
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:09,290
Was it here?

1612
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:10,330
No.

1613
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:13,990
Game of...

1614
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:16,930
Yeah, where was my nomination for the Game of Words?

1615
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,460
I have one...

1616
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,620
Where was my nomination?

1617
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:42,950
Big energy!

1618
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:52,260
It would be Expedition 33.

1619
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,200
Truly!

1620
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:57,760
Don't...

1621
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,440
We could just say don't knock it till you try.

1622
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,160
There's always next year.

1623
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:11,180
well do they I mean Elden Ring DLC got nominated so why
couldn't my DLC be

1624
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:29,180
nominated lost to Expedition 33 how could this happen how
could this happen wait oh did I mess up I thought there was

1625
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:36,200
more smash oh there's no more smash we gotta go back to
fairy

1626
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:43,740
Rigged!

1627
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,600
Rigged!

1628
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,700
What do?

1629
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,420
I've only heard about Expedition 33 that people be crying
about it.

1630
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,380
Oh, there was this smash!

1631
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,220
That's right!

1632
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:55,940
But I had to open this first.

1633
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,060
Uh-oh, I messed up again.

1634
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,080
Except I know where it is though.

1635
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,180
I know where to smash.

1636
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:05,360
I know.

1637
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,180
It gets emotional, does it?

1638
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:16,020
It does look fun, but it's also like the type of game that
I'm...

1639
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:16,600
I don't know.

1640
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,680
It's not really my type.

1641
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:18,640
Maybe.

1642
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:21,700
Big energy.

1643
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:22,720
Smash.

1644
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,320
But it might be fun.

1645
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:28,540
Big energy.

1646
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:29,120
Smash.

1647
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:29,820
Smash.

1648
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,340
Very good game.

1649
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,120
Is it long?

1650
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,200
I'm not so into turn-based stuff.

1651
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,440
That's how I feel.

1652
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,760
So that's why I'm like, I don't know.

1653
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:44,760
Might not be like for me, probably.

1654
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:46,720
It's pretty long.

1655
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,660
Devs?

1656
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,700
Devs?

1657
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,840
Do you see that on the house?

1658
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,500
30, 40 hours?

1659
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:02,440
Dang.

1660
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,560
Romance is in the air.

1661
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:17,220
Were they under the mistletoe, you think?

1662
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:19,900
Froggy streets.

1663
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:31,150
I think the music I chose for this is pretty cute still
though.

1664
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,530
I still think it's kind of cute.

1665
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:36,610
I'm not gonna lie.

1666
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:41,650
You like the music?

1667
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:44,550
It's extremely Christmas, isn't it?

1668
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:46,550
What was it, wasn't it?

1669
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:48,470
Yeah, we got everything here.

1670
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:50,290
See you!

1671
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:54,110
Froggy!

1672
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:58,010
Froggy!

1673
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:04,310
That's me right now.

1674
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:07,370
I see Fauna.

1675
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:11,630
I...

1676
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:12,310
Mayoshi.

1677
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:15,270
Man.

1678
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:17,130
Wait!

1679
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:18,310
I did include Duby!

1680
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:19,330
I thought I did!

1681
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:23,430
Christmas time is here.

1682
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:25,510
Merry Christmas!

1683
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,470
I was like, wait a second, though.

1684
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:28,790
I thought I included Duby.

1685
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:40,730
It's been a whole Wow you guys There's been so much going on
in the year My own game is surprising me Isn't that so fun?

1686
01:39:47,880 --> 01:40:00,040
It's also like a good little I mean It's also I feel Good
time capsule for For things to Roll the coaster over here

1687
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:00,840
For real.

1688
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:06,460
It feels like, oh, I can't even believe it's only been one
year from so many things.

1689
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,300
Big energy.

1690
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:13,220
That's what kind of blows my mind where I'm like, whoa.

1691
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,420
Good way to reflect on the past year.

1692
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:26,240
Yeah, even though I mean this is older, but that doesn't
matter.

1693
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,180
It's fine, whatever.

1694
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,160
Kiwawa's so cute.

1695
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:36,180
She's so cute and ganky.

1696
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,660
Physically, it's been one year, mentally like five.

1697
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:41,760
So true!

1698
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,320
Five words, five.

1699
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,200
Oh!

1700
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,300
I like how Kiwawa's outside.

1701
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,860
Of KFP.

1702
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:12,760
Big energy!

1703
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,060
What did I miss?

1704
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:15,140
Only just one.

1705
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:17,020
Oh, I think there was a Smash.

1706
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:21,580
Smash!

1707
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:23,660
Can't wait!

1708
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,460
Thank you!

1709
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:35,360
Retweeted that stupid pin asset I made because the postcard
talk reminded me.

1710
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,120
Wait, there's still more.

1711
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:41,300

coworkers.

1721
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:03,140
Jaguar.

1722
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,680
That's actually still kind of blew my mind that it's not
pronounced Jaguar.

1723
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:16,920
Wait, what did I miss?

1724
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:24,320
It is kind of blown my mind that it's not pronounced Jaguar.

1725
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,740
I still say Jaguar.

1726
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:31,280
Jaguar.

1727
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,200
Jaguar.

1728
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,600
Jaguar.

1729
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,640
Big energy.

1730
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,620
Jaguar.

1731
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:42,200
Jaguar.

1732
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,720
Jaguar.

1733
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,780

1734
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:47,760
Uh-uh.

Oh!

1736
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,520

Christmas style.

1747
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:11,340
Wait, I think I forgot the house.

1748
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,360
Doki is around.

1749
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,140
She's somewhere.

1750
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:23,300

Yeah, so that's why she's in the game.

01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:31,520
I haven't talked to her at all.

1768

Fairy down here.

1772
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,110
Big fish.

Spooky.

1774
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:00,050
Spooky?

1775
01:46:00,930 --> 01:46:01,390
Fairy.

1776
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:03,150
Right here.

1777
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:04,210
Big energy.

1778
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,830
We do be flying.

1779
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,800
It's like you were in charge of the development?

1780
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:32,980
Yeah, I mean, it was my creative idea, so I guess so.

1781
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:36,060
Cute!

1782
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,020
Oh.

1783
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:38,940
Oh.

1784
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:39,660
Oh.

1785
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:39,800
Oh.

1786
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:41,940
Smash!

1787
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:43,980
Smash!

1788
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,300
That's it.

1789
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:49,920
P-san.

1790
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:56,380
But I have no game development brain so most of that was
left up to the team.

1791
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,700
I kind of was just like, guys, here's my idea.

1792
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:00,980
Can we do this?

1793
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:05,080
And they were like, makashete, me too.

1794
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:06,880
And I said, thank you!

1795
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:08,920
Uh, nihonko?

1796
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,840
That's exactly how the whole conversation went.

1797
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:25,970
You eat Japanese?

1798
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:26,990
No, I don't know.

1799
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:29,050
No, I said I don't understand Japanese.

1800
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:32,370
I don't understand it.

1801
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:38,290
No questions asked.

1802
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:40,430
No, I asked many questions.

1803
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:47,950
But it would be great to get the team back together to do
some more.

1804
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:51,950
It's not a jailbird!

1805
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:55,510
To do more stuff in the game.

1806
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:57,350
Snuffers!

1807
01:47:58,130 --> 01:47:59,010
Merry Christmas.

1808
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:05,710
The full sloppy sister crew is about.

1809
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:08,210
Snuffy.

1810
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:23,690
This map is pretty big too.

1811
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:25,670
Smash.

1812
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,910
Do I need to smash in there?

1813
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:28,610
Oh, maybe we're fine.

1814
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:30,170
Oh wait, I need the froggy.

1815
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:32,790
Directed by...

1816
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:38,970
Exactly.

1817
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:42,790
A hundred percent.

1818
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:47,210
Feliz Año Nuevo!

1819
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:48,250
Buenas...

1820
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,370
Buenas noches!

1821
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:53,110
Buenas noches!

1822
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:56,030
Yeah!

1823
01:48:57,850 --> 01:48:58,970
Uh...

1824
01:48:58,970 --> 01:48:59,810
What was I missed?

1825
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:00,290
Oh, fairy.

1826
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:03,990
Subkoshi, tabemash.

1827
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,750
No, tabemasen, tabemasen.

1828
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:12,010
Tabemasen!

1829
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:12,850
Tabemasen!

1830
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:16,010
Egg energy!

1831
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:18,370
Did I say everything right?

1832
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:21,610
Did I say it right?

1833
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:25,330
Where's my pronunciation?

1834
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:26,710
Way bien?

1835
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:31,610
Yeah, it was good.

1836
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:34,820
Yeah.

1837
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:36,710
Yeah.

1838
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:38,270
Yeah.

1839
01:49:38,690 --> 01:49:38,930
Yeah.

1840
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,970
Wait, I'm missing two.

1841
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:43,770
Rock roll.

1842
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:48,770
Reggie!

1843
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:52,150
Hehehehe.

1844
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:52,750
Hehehehe.

1845
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:55,630
Hehehehe.

1846
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:58,190
Uh-oh.

1847
01:49:59,430 --> 01:49:59,930
Team?

1848
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:01,390
I'm lost.

1849
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:07,010
Team, we need two more candies.

1850
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:11,630
Team, we're gonna run out of time.

1851
01:50:12,570 --> 01:50:13,400
Oh, I found them.

1852
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:18,240
Gang, we might be lost.

1853
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:19,560
Never.

1854
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:20,600
Never lost.

1855
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,220
Alright!

1856
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:24,800
Four more levels.

1857
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,980
I love how this one is just parking lot.

1858
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,260
I think they ran out of names.

1859
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:38,300
We're like, guys, Merry Christmas at the parking lot.

1860
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,520
The most festive place.

1861
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:44,120
Okay, but parking lots you gotta be at.

1862
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:45,820
For...

1863
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:49,380
You park to go get presents.

1864
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,620
Everybody knows that.

1865
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,140
Short, sweet, to the point.

1866
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:01,660
Wait, why did I start off as a skelly if I need to?

1867
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:03,440
Wait, was there... Did you guys see it?

1868
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:06,320
A place to open?

1869
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:07,180
I didn't.

1870
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,160
Smash!

1871
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:10,340
Smash!

1872
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:17,780
Trick or trunk to buy Christmas?

1873
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,220
Look at, we're seriously in the parking lot.

1874
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:21,920
How festive.

1875
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:28,620
We joke, but some people are celebrating New Year's right
now in the parking lot.

1876
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,220
So, who are we to judge?

1877
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:38,740
Poppin' in to wish me a happy new year!

1878
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:41,880
Happy new year!

1879
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:52,280
One thing, I want to talk a little bit about my goals for
new year.

1880
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:54,460
I have...

1881
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:55,820
This is I, I, go in.

1882
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,220
Say, Merry Christmas!

1883
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,080
Her voice is so cute.

1884
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:01,760
Um...

1885
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,980
What did I write down?

1886
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,080
I wrote down some stuff.

1887
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:09,380
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1888
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:23,360
Um, one thing that I have not done in quite a long time, and
some of it has been because of my voice.

1889
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:24,300
Looky.

1890
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:31,540
Some of it has been because, excuse me, has been because
just, I don't know, I get so tired.

1891
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,160
But I want to bring back more.

1892
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:43,860
post game yapping just where I'm like you know I finish a
game and then I'm like okay we're gonna talk now for long

1893
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:53,860
time oh my god get out of the way Aibu please Aibu Aibu
please Aibu how did I get out of here how did I get past you

1894
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:05,300
so I'm not very I don't feel like I'm very confident in
doing like full Zatsudan stream full like chatting streams

1895
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:14,280
so I feel like I can instead supplement with more yapping
post game sometimes give sometimes I just game until I'm

1896
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:24,720
like literally so like I can give no more and so that's when
I'm like okay I'm tired I'm gonna go I'm gonna go rest but

1897
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:37,440
that's one of my goals is to bring that back and one thing I
want to do more are like more freebies Um, you know, just in

1898
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:45,860
general, like also membership stuff, like I want to start
doing, um, maybe some like meetups in VR chat, like kind of

1899
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:46,800
like a meet and greet.

1900
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:52,220
If you can't get a meet and greet, um, smash at, wait, what
am I missing?

1901
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,000
Oh, here.

1902
01:53:55,020 --> 01:54:00,120
If you can't get a meet and greet, if you can't go to a
convention or something, maybe one in VR chat or something

1903
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:00,960
like that.

1904
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:08,360
I don't want to commit entirely to doing like the monthly
wallpapers.

1905
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,480
Just yet.

1906
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:14,620
Because it's a lot to sometimes...

1907
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,800
I can't keep track of who I contact with artists sometimes.

1908
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:21,980
But that's another thing.

1909
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:26,180
Maybe I'll just offload that to Densa to staff.

1910
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,060
But yeah.

1911
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:32,800
And yeah, those are some more things that I want to do.

1912
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:37,960
Maybe some, like, also things that you can, like, what's the
word?

1913
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:46,500
Like, freebies that you can print out, like, 3D printable
things, or I did the stickers for members not too long ago.

1914
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:48,480
I want to do more things like that.

1915
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:50,760
So, yeah.

1916
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:54,460
That's another thing that I had in mind.

1917
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:58,300
Nexi!

1918
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,180
Get donated to.

1919
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:01,400
Stop it.

1920
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:02,880
Halloween!

1921
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,680
I sprinkled my fairy dust on these so they're extra special.

1922
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:10,520
I miss Halloween!

1923
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,760
Let me ask where it comes from.

1924
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:16,300
Oh my god, wait, the eyeball post is too cute.

1925
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,200
Where's anything to unlock?

1926
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:25,940
I miss Halloween.

1927
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:27,700
Me too.

1928
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:28,260
Yeah.

1929
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:29,680
I miss Halloween.

1930
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:32,620
Gingerbread.

1931
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:33,620
I want gingerbread.

1932
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:35,740
If...

1933
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:36,540
Oh my gosh, wait.

1934
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:40,380
You guys, I think stores will be closed tomorrow.

1935
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,120
I can't get...

1936
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:47,140
I was like, oh, I'm gonna get pumpkin pie tomorrow.

1937
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:51,740
I can't get it if the stores are closed.

1938
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:55,680
Rip my chungus live.

1939
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:57,940
After live.

1940
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:00,260
Well, I actually, you know, rip in general.

1941
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:03,540
You can say rip to me, but I'm a ghost.

1942
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:05,920
So it's kind of like telling me to die.

1943
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:09,180
You're like, rest in peace.

1944
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:10,640
What, you want me to go away?

1945
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:13,180
So rude.

1946
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:26,120
Just, don't, you can't just tell me that.

1947
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,080
Rest in misery?

1948
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:31,440
Well, it's more like, just don't say it at all.

1949
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,700
You can just say...

1950
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:41,670
Spooky.

1951
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:44,770
You can say...

1952
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:48,770
You know what?

1953
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:53,750
If you have nothing nice to say, you don't need to say
anything at all.

1954
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:56,690
Oopsie poopsie.

1955
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:57,530
Perfect.

1956
01:56:58,890 --> 01:56:59,650
Merry Christmas.

1957
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:01,570
Merry Christmas, Nuffie!

1958
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:05,130
I'll see you in a few hours.

1959
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:08,650
I think I need to smash.

1960
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:10,570
No!

1961
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:12,630
I need to moly kill me.

1962
01:57:13,690 --> 01:57:14,490
Loopsie poopsie.

1963
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:15,710
Yeah, loopsie poopsie!

1964
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:20,850
Oh, I do need to smash, though.

1965
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:26,280
You could say rest in pizza.

1966
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:27,860
Rest in pepperoni.

1967
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,060
Because then it's like, oh, yeah.

1968
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,140
I don't really like pepperoni, though.

1969
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,260
I'm offended by that.

1970
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:33,840
Never mind.

1971
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:34,820
Don't say that to me.

1972
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:40,600
In pizza.

1973
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:41,920
Rest in pizza.

1974
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:47,840
Rest in pineapple.

1975
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:50,540
So...

1976
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,160
Rest in pineapple.

1977
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:54,780
Wait, where's a fairy?

1978
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:56,560
Besides Maya.

1979
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,360
There it is.

1980
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:04,180
Big energy.

1981
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:05,460
Hot soup.

1982
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,320
Look, it's corn soup, everybody.

1983
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:10,020
Corn soup.

1984
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,040
I'm going to have that after stream.

1985
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:14,900
Do you guys ever think about, like...

1986
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:15,240
Oh, wait.

1987
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:16,040
We got to kiss you.

1988
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:22,000
Do you guys ever try to, like, plan your final meal of the
year?

1989
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:23,180
I try to do that.

1990
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:32,940
Um, and after I talked about those pizza rolls on stream, I
was like, I think I'm going to make that my final food of

1991
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,240
the year.

1992
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:34,140
Big energy.

1993
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:35,120
And so I made them today.

1994
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:37,080
But I made them for lunch.

1995
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:42,120
So I was like, wait, I'm going to have to eat something else
in the day.

1996
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:42,940
What do I eat?

1997
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:48,600
And so I think I will have corn soup as my final food of
2025.

1998
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,860
I thought you were going to stop at final meal.

1999
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,500
Like a single person said yes.

2000
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:04,310
Think about it.

2001
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:11,490
Like, you end the year with a good food and then you are
starting the next year with something delicious in your

2002
01:59:11,490 --> 01:59:14,570
tummy and on your taste buds and you're like, yeah!

2003
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:17,550
I'm getting jolly bee as my last meal.

2004
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:19,830
You do?

2005
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:20,810
Okay, machi.

2006
01:59:20,850 --> 01:59:21,850
Machi my man.

2007
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,030
Not really.

2008
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:25,190
I never think about it.

2009
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:28,230
Well, I think a good food is like the cure to anything.

2010
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:32,730
If you're having a bad day, Just get something yummy.

2011
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:38,660
I think is a great plan.

2012
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:46,600
Oh my gosh, sometimes I feel like I'm getting Hansel and
Gretel with collecting these candies like this.

2013
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:55,110
I had Popeyes.

2014
01:59:55,590 --> 01:59:57,230
I don't think I've ever had a Popeyes.

2015
01:59:58,090 --> 01:59:59,690
What is your best biscuit?

2016
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:06,870
Like, what is your, like, you know how everyone was like,
there was, what was the other, there was like those biscuit

2017
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:07,230

2018
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:12,110
Um...

2019
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:12,770
Carbonara!

2020
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:13,730
Wait, can I come over?

2021
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:14,530
Can I pizzazz?

2022
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:16,110
Can I have it by, please?

2023
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:21,580
Red lobster.

2024
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,420
Those are the cheddar biscuits, right?

2025
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:24,480
I've never had those either.

2026
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:27,800
Bojangles.

2027
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,100
Popeye's biscuits are my fave.

2028
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:41,610
No, please!

2029
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:42,910
Turn back around!

2030
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:44,490
Turn back around!

2031
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:46,570
Oh my god.

2032
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:50,370
Okay, I don't think we're going to be able to get that until
we kiss them.

2033
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:52,030
They're two in the way.

2034
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:57,050
Happy early New Year's.

2035
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:58,390
Happy New Year!

2036
02:00:59,910 --> 02:01:00,370
Oh my gosh.

2037
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:01,450
My aim.

2038
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:08,170
Smash.

2039
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:10,630
Like you.

2040
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:13,170
Chicken and waffles.

2041
02:01:13,490 --> 02:01:14,530
I love...

2042
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:16,710
Oh my gosh, I'm so obsessed with chicken and waffles.

2043
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:19,150
But I don't know ever where to get them.

2044
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:21,290
I always just kind of make them myself.

2045
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:25,370
There's like something, I don't know.

2046
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:34,670
Like, there used to be a place that was, unfortunately moved
away from it, and then after I moved, they closed down.

2047
02:01:34,790 --> 02:01:37,010
So I can't even, I can't even go anymore.

2048
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:41,910
But they made the most amazing chicken and waffles ever.

2049
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:44,610
You can get them at IHOP sometimes.

2050
02:01:45,150 --> 02:01:45,870
No kidding.

2051
02:01:51,680 --> 02:02:02,820
you were keeping them in business clearly they were so good
i'm telling you and it was a local place so it wasn't like a

2052
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:13,560
chain or anything why is this on the ground is that liz's uh
sword i just noticed

2053
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:27,720
i've never had the chicken and waffles combo it's i'm a huge
sweet savory fan so for me it's like perfect but if you

2054
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:33,560

2055
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:43,060

2056
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:58,740

pineapple on pizza i there i said it Sweet and savory.

You guys don't think so?

2093
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:04,540
That I've gotten pretty bad with speaking?

2094
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:07,680
You would think the more I public speak, the better.

2095
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:10,660
But I think I've just regressed.

2096

02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:14,690
It's exactly at midnight.

2133
02:08:15,290 --> 02:08:17,610
You can order your spaghetti.

2134
02:08:18,350 --> 02:08:20,390
Not 12... not 1159.

2135
02:08:21,410 --> 02:08:22,990
Not 1201.

2136
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:24,810
Ho ho ho ho!

2137
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:27,890
Christmas time is here.

2138
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:33,630
This gotta be exactly on the dot 12.

2139
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:35,610
Spooky.

2140
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:45,400
And we'll deliver the spaghetti the following midnight.

2141
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:48,580
You hear me?

2142
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:53,120
My screen is gonna have a high contrast, mint shaped
imprint.

2143
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:56,660
That sounds like a scam?

2144
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:57,560
That's annoying?

2145
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:58,620
What do you mean?

2146
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,740
We're very exclusive.

2147
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:02,000
Oh, sorry.

2148
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:10,600
We're a very exclusive and, like, sought-after spaghetti
making company.

2149
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:11,980
You can't just, you know.

2150
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:19,020
Sorry that we don't cater to your needs, but this is just
how the world works, baby.

2151
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:31,580
I forgot some over here.

2152
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:37,620
Sad.

2153
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:40,400
High-end spaghetti.

2154
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:45,800
Yes, our clientele, they understand everything that goes
into like this.

2155
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:46,460
Happy Halloween!

2156
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:50,180
I sprinkled my fairy dust on these so they're extra special.

2157
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:51,580
Into our company.

2158
02:09:58,930 --> 02:10:00,290
Please understand.

2159
02:10:02,510 --> 02:10:03,790
It's just business.

2160
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:04,690
I booze understand.

2161
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:05,650
That's what I'm saying!

2162
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:09,290
That's exactly what I'm saying.

2163
02:10:12,090 --> 02:10:13,930
This is a huge map.

2164
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:16,190
Final level, baby.

2165
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:23,090
Can I pay extra for chicken parm?

2166
02:10:23,210 --> 02:10:25,910
No, no, you get it as we make it.

2167
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:27,970
That's how we only make it one way.

2168
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:29,390
Regular spaghetti.

2169
02:10:30,410 --> 02:10:32,010

Push, push, mama, push, push.

2180
02:11:46,530 --> 02:11:46,990
You're joking.

2181
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:47,910
No, I wish I were.

2182
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:50,050
It's kind of awesome though.

2183
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:55,710
And then there are people that will like, time their roller
coasters.

2184
02:11:56,410 --> 02:12:01,870
So they'll time trying to get on a roller coaster and
exactly fill his vault.

2185
02:12:04,430 --> 02:12:05,450
Superchat time!

2186
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:07,130
No Superchat though.

2187
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:10,370
Honestly, stream labs are better.

2188
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,030
because you're not giving money to YouTube.

2189
02:12:12,190 --> 02:12:13,110
Big energy.

2190
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:15,930
So thank you.

2191
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:19,070
Thank you for not giving money to YouTube.

2192
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,170
Naughty YouTube.

2193
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:22,050
Uh-oh.

2194
02:12:22,410 --> 02:12:22,870
No!

2195
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:26,510
But what was I saying?

2196
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,940
Oh yeah, people will time their roller coasters.

2197
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:39,760
They'll get on roller coasters and time it so that the first
drop is on the new year.

2198
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:41,840
That also seems... I want to try that.

2199
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:42,760
That seems exciting.

2200
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,420
Big energy.

2201
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:45,360
Big energy!

2202
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:47,080
Spooky!

2203
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:53,460
Happy Halloween!

2204
02:12:54,540 --> 02:12:57,380
Slavic fellow, thank you so much for the 20 gift!

2205
02:12:57,600 --> 02:12:58,400
Trick or treat!

2206
02:12:59,100 --> 02:12:59,880
Thank you!

2207
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,080
Thank you!

2208
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,680
I think...

2209
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:06,340
There we go.

2210
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:08,000
Here.

2211
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:09,200
Got a feeling.

2212
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:11,300
There was something I needed to open.

2213
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:12,980
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

2214
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:19,180
I need to find a way to cure these poor lonely Aibu.

2215
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:23,100
And welcome to Membushet!

2216
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:24,860
Thank you!

2217
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:28,480
This map is humongous you guys.

2218
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:29,300
Look at the time.

2219
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:30,600
We've barely...

2220
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:35,000
Who's hoarding all this stuff here?

2221
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:36,060
Oh, stuffy.

2222
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:39,100
Is lime in this game?

2223
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:39,760
Yeah.

2224
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,160
Merry Christmas!

2225
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:50,510
Raccoon moment.

2226
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:51,990
Truly smash.

2227
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:59,280
That would have been so easy to miss that.

2228
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,180
I think this level is going to be hard, you guys.

2229
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:04,800
Dio.

2230
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:08,880
Is there anything...

2231
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:14,320
I know sometimes people will time movies to certain things.

2232
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:16,020
Oh, let's go get that trash can real quick.

2233
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:18,500
Smoothie.

2234
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:21,620
Some people will time movies to certain things for midnight.

2235
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:24,140
Is there anything you guys have, like, tried to time before?

2236
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:24,860
Wait.

2237
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:27,540
What if we timed this stream?

2238
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:40,960
What if, okay, what if you timed the stream to where if you
start watching this stream at so many minutes and so many

2239
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:43,740
seconds in, I will say happy new year.

2240
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:48,320
Wouldn't that be so crazy?

2241
02:14:53,540 --> 02:15:02,520
Spider-Man 2 and he says Pizza time at midnight Coco Welcome
to a membership Thank you

2242
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,500
Do be trying

2243
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:22,160
Not fair yet I think he's the only guy around here Or maybe
there's one more Let's go check

2244
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:26,460
guy.

2245
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:28,500
Thank you for the vibe get it!

2246
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:32,340
You have to end stream before midnight then.

2247
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:36,100
Yeah, I think I have to because I'm getting sleepy.

2248
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:38,580
Oh.

2249
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:41,620
I was talking with Phoebe yesterday.

2250
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:44,360
I was just like, she was like, do you want to try?

2251
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:47,620
She's like, I always try to stay up for the sunrise, the
first sunrise.

2252
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,260
And I've tried to do that before too.

2253
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:53,400
I was like, yeah, I've tried that before.

2254
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:55,900
She's like, you want to do it together tomorrow?

2255
02:15:56,080 --> 02:16:00,080
when I was like, I don't think I'll make it.

2256
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:01,740
Maybe though, I might make it.

2257
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:06,060
I might get so excited because of, Merry Christmas.

2258
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:09,020
I might get so excited because of the collab.

2259
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:09,940
I'm excited.

2260
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:12,960
I'm, like, I'm all, like, buzzed from it.

2261
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:15,980
I'm like, Happy Halloween.

2262
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:23,740
It's hard for me to stream late because I get, even though
I'm, like, yawning and I'm like, oh, guys, I'm so sleepy.

2263
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:32,580
Oh, Like, like right now, I will, I end stream and I'm like
so like...

2264
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:36,580
It's hard for me to...

2265
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:39,840
For me to sleep after.

2266
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:48,680
I may seem Eepy, but then I'm like awake for so much longer.

2267
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:51,480
Okay, we got Duby over here.

2268
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:51,800
Really?

2269
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:53,000
Thank you so much for the...

2270
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,020
Oh, I've kept going!

2271
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:56,560
Oh wait, there's some things I need to smash.

2272
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:57,160
Oh shoot.

2273
02:16:58,820 --> 02:17:00,540
I always yawn when I'm not sleepy.

2274
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:01,520
Me too!

2275
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:03,400
I don't know why.

2276
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:09,020
There's a fairy here.

2277
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:11,260
There's a maid here.

2278
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:13,780
No smash.

2279
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:17,260
Smash here.

2280
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:22,240
Happy late New Year, Minto.

2281
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:23,620
You're early for me!

2282
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:29,400
I think there's one.

2283
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:33,260
In here.

2284
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:39,060
I guess I could have done this.

2285
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,840
Push them!

2286
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:44,300
Here, got some candy.

2287
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:45,620
Thank you.

2288
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:45,780
Oh.

2289
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:47,200
You can have the green ones.

2290
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,580
In here, there's smash.

2291
02:17:58,820 --> 02:17:59,240
Smash.

2292
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:00,840
Okay, time to smash.

2293
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:03,380
What time is it for you?

2294
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:04,860
That time right there.

2295
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:07,060
9-18.

2296
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:09,480
Because I...

2297
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:15,760
My maid cafe operates It's in the EST time zone, even though
I'm virtual Akihabara.

2298
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:23,600
I gotta get, I haven't adjusted my clock, so I just, I just
stay in EST.

2299
02:18:30,490 --> 02:18:31,810
Oh, I was here.

2300
02:18:36,030 --> 02:18:36,930
She's worldwide!

2301
02:18:37,370 --> 02:18:38,230
Oops, smash.

2302
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:39,170
More smash.

2303
02:18:43,890 --> 02:18:45,690
Virtual world time is funky like that.

2304
02:18:45,770 --> 02:18:46,490
Yeah, exactly.

2305
02:18:46,710 --> 02:18:47,470
It's kind of, you know.

2306
02:18:48,450 --> 02:18:49,610
It's all wonky.

2307
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:53,250
Oh my god, there were none in here.

2308
02:18:59,650 --> 02:19:01,090
Were there anything else over here?

2309
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:02,990
I think I got everything, though.

2310
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:08,370
Uh-oh, guys.

2311
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:11,150
I passed a candy?

2312
02:19:12,550 --> 02:19:13,630
I walked past one.

2313
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:16,330
I went past it twice now.

2314
02:19:16,430 --> 02:19:17,290
Wait, was it over here?

2315
02:19:20,310 --> 02:19:22,090
My VTuber is blind.

2316
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:26,550
Oh, I see it.

2317
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:33,030
My VTuber is blind.

2318
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:39,850
And then I need to go down here towards Ashton.

2319
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:51,320
Goes over here.

2320
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:52,680
Oh.

2321
02:19:57,460 --> 02:19:58,940
Look what they're specialized.

2322
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:00,460
My brand.

2323
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,240
Uh-oh, wait.

2324
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:03,180
Oh no, I want to...

2325
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,120
I'm stuck.

2326
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:08,460
Wait, maybe I go around this way.

2327
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:09,470
I can make it.

2328
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:12,820
Happy New Year.

2329
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:16,380
What are some of your New Year resolutions, your goals?

2330
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:26,100
Was there anything that you wanted to do this year and ended
up being lazy?

2331
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:30,260
More gym!

2332
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:32,180
Oh boy.

2333
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:34,020
Big energy.

2334
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,560
Wait, I have to go down this way.

2335
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:39,040
Be less lazy.

2336
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:42,220
Good egg smoking!

2337
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:45,060
I can help with that.

2338
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:49,100
If we need me to.

2339
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:52,860
I can be of assistance.

2340
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:54,820
I've done it before.

2341
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:00,380
Nice.

2342
02:21:01,180 --> 02:21:02,360
My garbage candy.

2343
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:06,220
Yeah, I'm going to be trying to draw more.

2344
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:08,900
That's one of my goals.

2345
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:15,190
Start the Appalachian Trail.

2346
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:19,050
How long is it?

2347
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:20,810
The Appalachian Trail.

2348
02:21:23,890 --> 02:21:25,590
Guys, I don't know.

2349
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:29,770
We still have a lot of coins left, and I have no idea where
I haven't checked.

2350
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:31,370
Uh-oh.

2351
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:45,210
Check the water.

2352
02:21:46,230 --> 02:21:47,630
It's like a A month long?

2353
02:21:48,270 --> 02:21:48,750
What?

2354
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:51,110
I thought it was like...

2355
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:53,790
I thought it was like a week.

2356
02:21:58,370 --> 02:21:59,830
A whole month.

2357
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:01,830
I don't think I missed talking to somebody.

2358
02:22:02,170 --> 02:22:06,590
I need to find Frogbert, but I don't know where I put him.

2359
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:08,050
Oh gosh.

2360
02:22:08,970 --> 02:22:10,250
Where did I put Frogbert?

2361
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:11,430
Uh-oh.

2362
02:22:12,130 --> 02:22:14,430
Three, wait, three to six months?

2363
02:22:16,950 --> 02:22:17,730
East Coast.

2364
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:22,010
Pretty sure I talked to Doki, no?

2365
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:27,540
Frogbird!

2366
02:22:28,580 --> 02:22:29,020
Frogbird!

2367
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:31,440
I remember you left a frogbird at the right side.

2368
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:32,180
Alright.

2369
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:35,140
Orbital Vagabond, I'm trusting you.

2370
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:36,940
I'm trusting you.

2371
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:42,120
I'll go talk to Doki anyway, because we're right here.

2372
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:43,520
That's a fairy.

2373
02:22:44,980 --> 02:22:45,420
Smash!

2374
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:46,700
Yep, we talked to Doki.

2375
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:50,400
It's among the barrels.

2376
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:56,280
Wow, amazing memory.

2377
02:22:57,140 --> 02:22:58,140
Froggy.

2378
02:22:58,800 --> 02:22:59,080
Froggy.

2379
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:01,640
Wow, amazing memory.

2380
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:10,180
Check out more of the water.

2381
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,380
Oh, very bug!

2382
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:16,280
You're on an island!

2383
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:18,120
Kick or cheat.

2384
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:21,880
I'm inside your hole.

2385
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:34,280
We still have 26 minutes remaining.

2386
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:34,980
That's crazy.

2387
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:36,540
No!

2388
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:40,440
I don't want to let...

2389
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:41,420
Wait, here, I'll...

2390
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:43,820
I'm going to go get some more water and you guys can watch
this, okay?

2391
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:45,800
Or...

2392
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:49,960
Do you want to play the game yourself and then you get the
reward yourself?

2393
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:55,570
Play it.

2394
02:23:57,430 --> 02:24:00,610
Okay, I'm going to get more water then and you guys can
watch.

2395
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:02,810
Boo!

2396
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:07,570
It is I, Minto, the Christmas bear!

2397
02:24:08,830 --> 02:24:13,710
And if you are seeing this video, that means you completed
Freak or Treat!

2398
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:17,230
Or the additional Christmas levels.

2399
02:24:18,270 --> 02:24:19,570
I don't know what to call that part.

2400
02:24:20,630 --> 02:24:21,630
Is it still Freak or Treat?

2401
02:24:22,710 --> 02:24:27,290
Maybe we can call it Jingle Freaks.

2402
02:24:29,470 --> 02:24:31,350
It's a work in progress.

2403
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:38,390
Anyway, you probably already got the other gift from the
Halloween levels if you got this far.

2404
02:24:39,050 --> 02:24:46,790
I wanted to come personally, and thank you for not only
playing my game, but also taking the time to finish it.

2405
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:48,490
So, thank you!

2406
02:24:49,370 --> 02:24:51,670
I hope some of the levels didn't give you too much trouble.

2407
02:24:52,210 --> 02:25:02,050
I know those final candies can be a little tricky sometimes,
but I hope you have a super duper, super Merry Christmas.

2408
02:25:02,070 --> 02:25:04,870
and a happy Halloween!

2409
02:25:06,050 --> 02:25:12,170
I hope we can spend many, many more holidays together, and I
will catch you later.

2410
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:14,210
Ew.

2411
02:25:15,230 --> 02:25:16,130
In your walls.

2412
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:20,330
Anyway, thank you so much.

2413
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:21,410
Merry Christmas.

2414
02:25:22,670 --> 02:25:23,450
Bye-bye!

2415
02:25:37,890 --> 02:25:38,770
Bye!

2416
02:25:41,090 --> 02:25:41,970
Yay!

2417
02:25:43,290 --> 02:25:44,170
Yay!

2418
02:25:44,610 --> 02:25:44,650
Yay!

2419
02:25:44,670 --> 02:25:45,110
Wait!

2420
02:25:45,590 --> 02:25:46,790
I get to do it!

2421
02:25:47,550 --> 02:25:48,370
I get to put it!

2422
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:52,190
Hold on, let me... let me... I had to click out so I'm gonna
put it onto my own BGM.

2423
02:25:54,530 --> 02:25:55,530
We'll do...

2424
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:56,670
We'll do...

2425
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:08,780
50 games.

2426
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,240
My completed list.

2427
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,860
I must put it on.

2428
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:16,660
12, 31, 2025.

2429
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,660
Freak or treat.

2430
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,990
Give me a second.

2431
02:26:26,270 --> 02:26:27,610
I'll show you guys my list.

2432
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:30,990
Give me a second.

2433
02:26:35,850 --> 02:26:37,170
One second, one second.

2434
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:04,040
There it is.

2435
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:04,680
Wait, hold on.

2436
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:06,580
I'm gonna put it underneath.

2437
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:07,340
There we go.

2438
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:09,620
Oh, wait, but then it blocks off some of it.

2439
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:10,400
I can make it smaller.

2440
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:13,360
Wait, hold on.

2441
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:15,440
There we go.

2442
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:15,620
Wait.

2443
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:16,340
Oh, where'd it go?

2444
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:20,780
Wait, where'd it go?

2445
02:27:27,130 --> 02:27:28,330
How to do that?

2446
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:32,930
Wait, do you guys see it?

2447
02:27:38,770 --> 02:27:39,530
Where'd it go?

2448
02:27:41,990 --> 02:27:43,930
No, yeah, but you see it...

2449
02:27:43,930 --> 02:27:44,730
You see it now?

2450
02:27:46,730 --> 02:27:47,430
Do you see it here?

2451
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,600
That's so weird.

2452
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:55,320
It's only showing up.

2453
02:27:55,460 --> 02:27:56,980
Hold on, let me try this again.

2454
02:28:00,270 --> 02:28:00,930

02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:03,840

games for me to play in one stream.

I, um...

2516
02:32:44,050 --> 02:32:52,010

one, I don't want to feel so rushed with playing games.

2517
02:32:53,710 --> 02:33:01,250
challenge is that like for some of these I was just like oh

so yeah it was fun to do it for this year but I don't think

2521
02:33:26,990 --> 02:33:35,830
I'll do it again next year it wasn't that it stopped being
fun not for not at all but it was a bit of a challenge to be

games that I put off because I was like oh these will take a

And this is like me, I thought I was being like kind of
critical too.

2564
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:42,280
I was like, you know, this isn't even all the games that
we've played, you know?

2565
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:48,700
Like there's even more games that I don't count for like
having endings and things like that, so I don't include them

2566
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:50,620
on the list.

2567
02:39:54,860 --> 02:39:59,280

2576
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:34,020
Yeah.

2577
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:36,460
I might be a gamer.

2578
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:38,020
I might be a gamer.

2579
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:42,140
What's your game of the year?

2580
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:44,220
Of these?

2581
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:46,620

2582
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:48,080

2585
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:52,660
What is my game of the year?

2586
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:56,200
Trying to think of something that like really sticks out.

2587
02:40:58,380 --> 02:40:58,700
Hmm.

2588
02:41:01,930 --> 02:41:02,330
Um.

2589
02:41:05,470 --> 02:41:06,270
In general.

2590
02:41:09,050 --> 02:41:10,530
Of things that I've played.

2591
02:41:12,010 --> 02:41:12,130
Hmm.

2592
02:41:12,150 --> 02:41:14,130
Let's see...

2593
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:16,150
Let's see...

2594
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:19,470
Going through...

2595
02:41:19,470 --> 02:41:21,070
Maybe Mystery of the Druids.

2596
02:41:29,810 --> 02:41:30,210
Dredge?

2597
02:41:30,210 --> 02:41:32,390
I think it has to be dredge.

2598
02:41:32,670 --> 02:41:33,910
Dredge or Oblivion?

2599
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:37,150
Both of those I got like super...

2600
02:41:38,530 --> 02:41:40,250
Super like obsessed with.

2601
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:46,200
I loved dredge.

2602
02:41:47,480 --> 02:41:48,480
I really love dredge.

2603
02:41:49,540 --> 02:41:51,400
I think that is my Game of the Year is dredge.

2604
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:53,480
I played it so much.

2605
02:41:56,260 --> 02:41:57,500
I forgot about E-Tina.

2606
02:41:57,780 --> 02:41:58,880
I never forget about E-Tina.

2607
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:02,540
Wait, hold on.

2608
02:42:02,580 --> 02:42:03,680
This is not what I meant to put on.

2609
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:06,540
This one also is so sad.

2610
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:09,000
There we go.

2611
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:13,480
Let's see what else I got on here.

2612
02:42:19,870 --> 02:42:21,350
Do you guys see my tweet?

2613
02:42:22,070 --> 02:42:31,090
If you didn't, I had a dream the other night where I was on
a date with Dante from Devil May Cry.

2614
02:42:31,650 --> 02:42:33,770
And we were, like, in New York or something.

2615
02:42:33,910 --> 02:42:37,030
We were, like, on some, like, street cafe in New York.

2616
02:42:38,270 --> 02:42:40,210
And I remember his legs.

2617
02:42:40,270 --> 02:42:45,330
He, like, did that thing where he, like, swiped his legs,
like, up onto the table.

2618
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:48,330
And he, like, put them down really hard.

2619

I was like whoa he was like I'm gonna be seeing some other

the side and so and so and so and so and so and so and so

2624
02:43:25,370 --> 02:43:36,450

was so funny though I never thought that I would dream about

2628
02:44:10,830 --> 02:44:19,250
Dante Especially being on a date with Dante It was like And
my dream from what I remember It was like It started

02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:53,050
It might have been the migraine.

2641
02:44:56,530 --> 02:44:57,810
The migraine might have done...

2642
02:44:57,830 --> 02:45:00,790

02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:45,720
It's so funny because even if I don't have like a super
great experience playing a game itself, like Harvester.

2650
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:49,060
Playing it like was fine.

2651
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:54,240
But I always think of games and how much I reference them.

2652
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:55,320
You know.

2653
02:45:57,740 --> 02:45:59,980
Phil, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

2654
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:02,600
Tribe Princess, thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

2655
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:03,540
Thank you both.

2656
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:04,480
Thank you.

2657
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:07,900
You always were a kidder.

2658
02:46:08,740 --> 02:46:11,160
Like, I referenced Druid so much.

2659
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:13,220
I referenced Metal Gear so much, obviously.

2660
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:15,980
I referenced Harvester so much.

2661
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:26,120
Like, those are the games that I will remember so much
because of how much I referenced them.

2662
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:28,540
Weeks of fun, weeks of fun.

2663
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:31,420
And then Half-Life, I referenced so much.

2664
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:33,900
No, well, thank you so much for the 50s.

2665
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:37,240
Thank you!

2666
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:40,680
Booty shot!

2667
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:41,640
Booty shot!

2668
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:48,730
I love that we just say weeks of fun, weeks of fun!

2669
02:46:50,330 --> 02:46:52,990
What was your favorite stream this year?

2670
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:55,590
That's hard!

2671
02:46:55,830 --> 02:46:58,090
Wait, hold on, I'm gonna go through my channel again.

2672
02:47:00,310 --> 02:47:01,170
My favorite!

2673
02:47:02,190 --> 02:47:07,890
Part of me, I really like the Valentine's Day stream because
I just like doing those kinds of streams so much.

2674
02:47:07,910 --> 02:47:08,470
much.

2675
02:47:10,390 --> 02:47:11,370
Let's see what else.

2676
02:47:15,330 --> 02:47:16,050
Um,

2677
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:24,620
there's a lot of collabs that I had a lot of fun with.

2678
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:28,360
Burger bots was pretty fun.

2679
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:32,060
With uh, Nimmy Limu Snuffy Doki.

2680
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:35,700
Oh, let's see.

2681
02:47:40,300 --> 02:47:43,020
Peek with Moni, Kamimi and Mimi.

2682
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:45,260
was fun.

2683
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:49,940
I really like collabs because I feel like it's so fun.

2684
02:47:50,260 --> 02:47:50,880
Oh my god!

2685
02:47:51,140 --> 02:47:55,020
My Metal Gear figure unboxing was so...

2686
02:47:58,660 --> 02:48:00,440
That made me...

2687
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:07,670
That one and making the puppets I think I had a lot of fun
with.

2688
02:48:09,330 --> 02:48:11,550
Despite the It's Pink Incident.

2689
02:48:12,170 --> 02:48:14,510
I think those two are my favorites.

2690
02:48:14,650 --> 02:48:16,470
And it's funny because They're both hand cam.

2691
02:48:22,830 --> 02:48:23,510
Yeah.

2692
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:27,890
I'm glad I could give Nimmy her puppet.

2693
02:48:31,270 --> 02:48:33,570
I will be making more puppets in the future.

2694
02:48:35,050 --> 02:48:35,610
I was...

2695
02:48:35,610 --> 02:48:37,690
Oh, at my Jurassic Park arcade stream.

2696
02:48:37,810 --> 02:48:38,910
That was really fun, too.

2697
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:42,430
But I was asked about maybe...

2698
02:48:42,430 --> 02:48:45,330
So there was a convention that...

2699
02:48:45,350 --> 02:48:59,470
does a like a charity auction and they asked if I would like
to be a part of the charity auction and it's usually like

2700
02:48:59,470 --> 02:49:06,870
it's like people's kind of personal items it's not supposed
to be like you know high-ticketed items or anything like

2701
02:49:06,870 --> 02:49:16,330
that but I I suggested making a puppet for the auction for
the charity auction And I thought about also maybe making,

2702
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:20,590
like, you know, honestly, they're not so difficult to make.

2703
02:49:20,990 --> 02:49:25,370
So I feel like if I asked Steiner, we could do like a couple
times a year.

2704
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:32,130
I could have like very, I mean, they would be like the most
limited slots ever.

2705
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:36,310
For some handmade puppets.

2706
02:49:39,110 --> 02:49:40,310
Of like a few slots.

2707
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:47,060
That's one thing I also want to do.

2708
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:58,480
is uh I mean I don't I'm not super crafty but I do like
making hand made things so um one thing I would love that I

2709
02:49:58,480 --> 02:50:07,760
wish I could do but there's just too many of you guys is
like drawing my own like checky like like actually printing

2710
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:15,680
my own and then drawing on it and then sending it to you
guys um but luckily we'll have the checky for the Denzetsu

2711
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:22,460
Patreon on yeah like a deco checky there's too many of you
guys

2712
02:50:27,690 --> 02:50:34,290
everything would have to be super limited and then i would
feel so bad that only a few people can get them

2713
02:50:39,790 --> 02:50:48,430
so i do what i can in the ways that i can so but there's
that's more stuff that i I would like to do in 2026.

2714
02:50:48,750 --> 02:50:49,390
Yeah, yeah.

2715
02:50:49,910 --> 02:50:51,950
I bought that checkie binder today for that Patreon.

2716
02:50:52,770 --> 02:50:53,590
Thank you!

2717
02:50:53,910 --> 02:50:54,510
Thank you!

2718
02:50:54,650 --> 02:50:57,810
Yeah, just a couple more hours for the Densetsu.

2719
02:50:58,630 --> 02:50:59,330
Here, hold on.

2720
02:50:59,390 --> 02:51:00,950
Wait, can I...

2721
02:51:02,570 --> 02:51:03,250
Let's see.

2722
02:51:03,730 --> 02:51:04,050
What?

2723
02:51:05,410 --> 02:51:05,770
Sorry.

2724
02:51:09,610 --> 02:51:10,690

2725
02:51:14,490 --> 02:51:15,050
Two

2726
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:21,960
more hours.

2727
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,540
What was that noise?

2728
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:24,240
It was the game.

2729
02:51:24,580 --> 02:51:25,940
It was the freak-a-treat game.

2730
02:51:26,320 --> 02:51:34,080
Just a few more hours for the Tenetsu debut merch item so
you can get, like, the happy...

2731
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:34,360
Ooh!

02:51:39,060 --> 02:51:41,100

So cute!

2743
02:51:52,920 --> 02:52:00,240
acrylic stands which I think actually I love the way our
logo looks with the as the base like I think the colors look

2744
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:11,100
so good with the acrylic stand these and the checkie albums
because we will be starting checkies for um for the patreon

2745
02:52:11,100 --> 02:52:21,220
monthly checkies and and if uh if I can do checkies as well

are just the heads you guys look at this look at this

phoebe heads or vicky heads or all three of us heads yeah

2748
02:52:39,500 --> 02:52:51,340
there's also the merch from the maid cafe the one at asa

2749
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:56,580

more OIMO art.

2750
02:52:57,100 --> 02:52:58,000
Okay, add over.

2751
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:03,990
Add finished.

2752
02:53:15,410 --> 02:53:19,850
I was told that I should do one more final push for Densetsu
merch.

2753
02:53:21,330 --> 02:53:22,870
So I did it.

2754
02:53:22,970 --> 02:53:23,850
I did it.

2755
02:53:26,950 --> 02:53:28,030
Yes, yes, yes.

2756
02:53:28,990 --> 02:53:30,130
It would be a great...

2757
02:53:31,350 --> 02:53:31,850
Alright.

2758
02:53:32,470 --> 02:53:33,710
Setsuna.pro.

2759
02:53:34,410 --> 02:53:37,250
Den-Setsu.exe.

2760
02:53:37,690 --> 02:53:39,430
Debut merch.

2761
02:53:40,030 --> 02:53:42,390
Pre-order ends tonight.

2762
02:53:44,290 --> 02:53:45,070
There you go.

2763
02:53:46,890 --> 02:53:49,170
P. Hot dog.

2764
02:53:50,090 --> 02:53:54,550
Celebrating that I got a new job for the new year by giving
you a spiritual offering is a nice treat.

2765
02:53:55,070 --> 02:53:55,770
Sendah!

2766
02:53:55,930 --> 02:53:56,830
Congratulations!

2767
02:53:57,950 --> 02:53:58,650
Congratulations!

2768
02:54:01,350 --> 02:54:02,570
Should we play Mind Sweeper?

2769
02:54:07,100 --> 02:54:08,380
Wait, let me zoom in.

2770
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:09,960
Oh, wait.

2771
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:11,660
Wait, what if I do this?

2772
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:19,320
I don't want these randos here, though.

2773
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:29,250
It's a little scuff, don't worry about it.

2774
02:54:30,150 --> 02:54:33,380
Sorry, though.

2775
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:34,220
That works.

2776
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:39,740
Guys, I've never beat Mind Sweeper before.

2777
02:54:47,820 --> 02:54:50,000
Three means that three things are touching, right?

2778
02:54:50,380 --> 02:54:51,100
would be bad.

2779
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:56,540
And the one thing means one is touching, so that would be
bad.

2780
02:55:05,850 --> 02:55:06,950
Diagonals count too.

2781
02:55:07,330 --> 02:55:07,510
Yes.

2782
02:55:07,970 --> 02:55:09,950
So that's why it's three like this.

2783
02:55:12,590 --> 02:55:12,610
Right?

2784
02:55:13,250 --> 02:55:15,130
Oh, unless this is the diagonal.

2785
02:55:16,210 --> 02:55:17,150
Because it's a diagonal.

2786
02:55:18,950 --> 02:55:19,610
But what would be...

2787
02:55:19,610 --> 02:55:20,550
Oh, and then like that.

2788
02:55:22,610 --> 02:55:27,450
like that because then it's too oh wait but you don't know
this one because it could be too too

2789
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:39,780
oh this is a three oh my god wait now hold on i'm rethinking

No, I didn't say that.

2797
02:56:40,550 --> 02:56:41,270
I didn't say that.

2798
02:56:41,510 --> 02:56:42,170
I didn't say that.

2799
02:56:42,430 --> 02:56:43,730
Okay, I'm gonna do a random one.

2800
02:56:44,330 --> 02:56:45,490
Wait, this one though is easy.

2801
02:56:45,830 --> 02:56:47,750
One, two, three, four.

2802
02:56:49,750 --> 02:56:50,830
Four is easy.

2803
02:56:51,010 --> 02:56:52,010
This one is awesome.

2804
02:56:52,570 --> 02:56:52,870
Right?

2805
02:56:53,930 --> 02:56:54,390
Oh,

2806
02:56:59,510 --> 02:57:00,290
what do you mean though?

2807
02:57:08,570 --> 02:57:09,490
That's five.

2808
02:57:09,810 --> 02:57:11,150
Yeah, because of the ones here.

2809
02:57:12,290 --> 02:57:16,370
Oh, but it might not be that diagonal, is what you guys are
saying.

2810
02:57:18,970 --> 02:57:20,270
But this is for sure.

2811
02:57:22,630 --> 02:57:26,410
Guys, I did four, and then I added an extra one because of
these wands.

2812
02:57:26,670 --> 02:57:27,390
I can count.

2813
02:57:28,590 --> 02:57:29,030
Gosh.

2814
02:57:30,190 --> 02:57:32,230
You now have five flags around four.

2815
02:57:33,370 --> 02:57:35,750
Oh, oh, so then it would say five.

2816
02:57:39,430 --> 02:57:41,490
I get why you're yelling at me.

2817
02:57:49,620 --> 02:57:50,980
I get it.

2818
02:57:51,420 --> 02:57:52,940
This one probably, though, right?

2819
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:55,080
Oh, wait, no.

2820
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:56,500
Because then it would say two.

2821
02:57:58,780 --> 02:58:00,100
So this one's safe.

2822
02:58:06,740 --> 02:58:07,640
This one's safe.

2823
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,800
So then it would have to be this.

2824
02:58:24,970 --> 02:58:26,090
Oh, that is four.

2825
02:58:26,230 --> 02:58:27,650
Sorry, I didn't think of this one up here.

2826
02:58:27,890 --> 02:58:28,370
You're right.

2827
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:30,290
This is hard.

2828
02:58:33,890 --> 02:58:35,230
This is hard.

2829
02:58:35,530 --> 02:58:37,690
Wait, but then it has to be this.

2830
02:58:38,970 --> 02:58:41,990
Because that's one, two, three, four.

2831
02:58:57,370 --> 02:58:59,490
And it has to be this one too, right?

2832
02:59:01,390 --> 02:59:02,270
Because it's all...

2833
02:59:02,270 --> 02:59:02,730
Wait, no.

2834
02:59:02,930 --> 02:59:03,810
That's two already touched.

2835
02:59:03,990 --> 02:59:04,910
So this one's safe.

2836
02:59:06,930 --> 02:59:07,370
Oh!

2837
02:59:07,950 --> 02:59:08,390
Oh!

2838
02:59:08,390 --> 02:59:08,610
Oh!

2839
02:59:08,790 --> 02:59:09,230
Oh!

2840
02:59:09,390 --> 02:59:11,270
What a thrill I feel touching them.

2841
02:59:11,390 --> 02:59:12,010
Oh my god.

2842
02:59:16,870 --> 02:59:18,810
I'm gonna do a random one for funsies.

2843
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:30,520
Oh my god.

2844
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:33,840
Where do you go from here though?

2845
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:35,300
Playing with fire.

2846
02:59:37,960 --> 02:59:39,560
Where do I go from here though?

2847
02:59:40,740 --> 02:59:41,700
Like what would you do?

2848
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:46,060
The ones?

2849
02:59:49,780 --> 02:59:51,340
Oh, this one.

2850
02:59:56,350 --> 02:59:58,790
One's on the outside corners.

2851
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:09,550
This one.

2852
03:00:15,340 --> 03:00:17,240
Below the three is safe.

2853
03:00:17,960 --> 03:00:18,580
Which three?

2854
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:23,480
Maybe you should start with a smaller map.

2855
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:23,960
No.

2856
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:25,840
This is the...

2857
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:27,120
This is the...

2858
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:31,360
Mind Sweeper experience that I must beat.

2859
03:00:32,380 --> 03:00:35,060
Maximus, I'm Mimi, so welcome to Membyship.

2860
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:35,760
Thank you!

2861
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:40,700
I'm gonna do another free-for-all.

2862
03:00:41,180 --> 03:00:45,710
Oh my god, oh, wait.

2863
03:00:45,890 --> 03:00:47,170
Oh, I thought there was a timer.

2864
03:00:47,350 --> 03:00:48,650
But it's going up, not down.

2865
03:00:48,830 --> 03:00:49,490
Okay, good.

2866
03:00:54,970 --> 03:00:58,330
There's that three above the bottom right three.

2867
03:00:58,970 --> 03:00:59,510
This one?

2868
03:01:10,570 --> 03:01:11,450
Wait, one.

2869
03:01:12,890 --> 03:01:13,590
Two, three.

2870
03:01:14,250 --> 03:01:14,630
Right?

2871
03:01:16,270 --> 03:01:17,850
It has to be this, sir.

2872
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:28,760
What else is it touching?

2873
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:30,420
Oh, I just noticed this one over here.

2874
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:30,800
Just kidding.

2875
03:01:31,300 --> 03:01:31,780
You're right.

2876
03:01:33,260 --> 03:01:34,460
That would be four.

2877
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:36,060
Oh, my gosh.

2878
03:01:36,200 --> 03:01:37,140
I get so focused.

2879
03:01:37,320 --> 03:01:38,420
I get so tunnel visioned.

2880
03:01:40,340 --> 03:01:42,220
I get so tunnel visioned.

2881
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:52,700
Thank you.

2882
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:54,600
Speaking of the stickers, thanks for the Vemble ones.

2883
03:01:54,740 --> 03:01:55,340
I like my pink.

2884
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:58,160
I saw your earbuds are so cute.

2885
03:01:58,460 --> 03:02:01,740
Thank you for printing out the stickers and using them.

2886
03:02:06,550 --> 03:02:13,970
Start with the one at the top But it could be either of
these It could be this one or this one How am I to know?

2887
03:02:14,430 --> 03:02:17,010
How am I to know?

2888
03:02:20,900 --> 03:02:31,840
This one, though It has to be this one because of this one

Like, here, here.

2894
03:03:17,960 --> 03:03:20,040

Okay, okay, okay.

Look up, gamer.

2962
03:07:40,370 --> 03:07:41,460
What's up?

2963
03:07:44,190 --> 03:07:45,130
Oh, like this one.

Happy New Year, Setsunan.

2971
03:08:10,760 --> 03:08:11,940
Is this all?

2972
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:12,900
Like this?

2973
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:15,160
Like all of that?

2974
03:08:15,860 --> 03:08:16,420
It's like that?

2975
03:08:17,340 --> 03:08:17,960
Like that?

2976
03:08:19,260 --> 03:08:20,860
Is that the name of the game?

2977
03:08:30,170 --> 03:08:32,130
We're only down to 88 bombs!

2978
03:08:34,650 --> 03:08:34,890
One.

2979
03:08:39,820 --> 03:08:41,240
So this one must be also.

2980
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:43,320
Right?

2981
03:08:46,010 --> 03:08:47,110
So one, two.

2982
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:52,340
Yes.

2983
03:08:54,720 --> 03:08:55,640
And this one, too.

2984
03:08:56,560 --> 03:08:57,260
So this one.

2985
03:08:58,440 --> 03:08:58,880
Safe.

2986
03:09:00,620 --> 03:09:00,980
Safe.

2987
03:09:01,420 --> 03:09:01,980
Safe.

2988
03:09:04,260 --> 03:09:05,220
Corner ones?

2989
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:05,460
Yeah.

2990
03:09:05,800 --> 03:09:06,100
Oh, here!

2991
03:09:06,300 --> 03:09:06,980
More corners!

2992
03:09:07,120 --> 03:09:08,100
You're right, you're right, you're right.

2993
03:09:08,680 --> 03:09:09,480
More corners!

2994
03:09:10,740 --> 03:09:16,380
Wait, would it be...

2995
03:09:17,080 --> 03:09:17,560
Wait.

2996
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:18,820
Is this one safe?

2997
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:20,920
No.

2998
03:09:21,380 --> 03:09:21,860
Oh, wait.

2999
03:09:22,100 --> 03:09:23,160

Too scary for me.

I'm a liar.

3022
03:10:55,350 --> 03:10:56,530
Sorry, I was looking at the corners.

3023
03:11:10,630 --> 03:11:12,930
If you explode in the game, you explode for real.

3024
03:11:13,070 --> 03:11:14,810
I know, that's why I'm so scared.

3025
03:11:17,130 --> 03:11:18,670
Yeah, I cornered too hard.

3026
03:11:18,990 --> 03:11:19,950
I got too comfy.

3027
03:11:20,510 --> 03:11:21,570
Too comfy for real.

3028
03:11:22,750 --> 03:11:23,890
But this one's safe.

3029
03:11:24,950 --> 03:11:25,230
Chill.

3030
03:11:29,390 --> 03:11:31,050

Safe.

3038
03:12:48,940 --> 03:12:50,960
We have left the safe zone.

It was touching, was it?

3050
03:13:29,700 --> 03:13:30,420

All right.

3053
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:39,640
Mistakes are the best teachers.

3054
03:13:39,900 --> 03:13:40,800
Exactly, everybody.

3055
03:13:41,380 --> 03:13:47,460

Hello!

03:14:51,860 --> 03:14:53,900
I'm learning Mind Sweeper.

3070
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:00,120
If I graduated, she means exploded into a thousand small
chunks.

3071
03:15:00,700 --> 03:15:08,080
Luckily, when that happens to me, all my ectoplasm, all you
gotta do is just like mop me up and then put me in a bucket

3072
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:12,540
and I will eventually get enough spiritual energy to...

3073
03:15:13,980 --> 03:15:15,660
To become me again.

3074
03:15:31,880 --> 03:15:37,100

went with the big one okay we're gonna go with the big one

Mop me up.

03:16:58,580 --> 03:17:00,000

3087
03:17:01,160 --> 03:17:02,180
You think this is a joke?

3088
03:17:13,580 --> 03:17:14,480
She's dead!

3089
03:17:15,560 --> 03:17:16,400

3094
03:17:51,350 --> 03:17:53,410
I don't think I'm ever gonna graduate.

3095
03:17:55,610 --> 03:17:57,330
I'm never gonna make it through school.

3096
03:17:58,110 --> 03:17:59,750
I'm never gonna catch my breath.

3097
03:18:00,210 --> 03:18:01,870
Say goodbye to those who knew me.

3098
03:18:02,230 --> 03:18:04,630
Why was I a fool in school for cutting Jim?

3099
03:18:09,870 --> 03:18:11,590
Hope he doesn't say right to me.

3100
03:18:12,230 --> 03:18:14,570
God, I really wish I knew how to play Mind Sweeper.

3101
03:18:16,070 --> 03:18:17,390
Click the button.

3102
03:18:17,710 --> 03:18:19,370
You must be swift as the core.

3103
03:18:19,390 --> 03:18:22,250
Coursing river, push the button.

3104
03:18:23,230 --> 03:18:28,850
With all the knowledge of the numbers, push the button.

3105
03:18:32,750 --> 03:18:33,270
I'm scared.

3106
03:18:33,470 --> 03:18:34,730
I'm going to push something in the middle.

3107
03:18:35,770 --> 03:18:36,330
One.

3108
03:18:37,170 --> 03:18:38,850
Enrolling Girl DM Academy.

3109
03:18:39,050 --> 03:18:42,690
Honestly, isn't she like crazy good at Mind Sweeper?

3110
03:18:44,530 --> 03:18:46,550
Guys, what move should I make right now?

3111
03:18:46,810 --> 03:18:47,390
I'm stuck.

3112
03:18:48,110 --> 03:18:48,770
I'm stuck.

3113
03:18:48,950 --> 03:18:49,830
I don't know what to do.

3114
03:18:51,050 --> 03:18:52,370
How many safe spots at the moment?

3115
03:18:52,610 --> 03:18:53,010
Gotta guess.

3116
03:18:53,470 --> 03:18:54,350
I just have to guess?

3117
03:18:57,690 --> 03:18:58,570
Look down, gamer.

3118
03:18:58,730 --> 03:18:59,270
At three.

3119
03:19:00,170 --> 03:19:00,230
This?

3120
03:19:02,650 --> 03:19:04,410
Three on bottom is safe.

3121
03:19:04,870 --> 03:19:05,470
Which one?

3122
03:19:19,660 --> 03:19:20,780
The left three.

3123
03:19:21,400 --> 03:19:22,220
This is safe?

3124
03:19:23,360 --> 03:19:24,940
How do you even know?

3125
03:19:30,930 --> 03:19:32,610
There's the only one with...

3126
03:19:35,890 --> 03:19:37,350
Oh, it's not safe.

3127
03:19:37,610 --> 03:19:38,870
Oh, they're all bombs!

3128
03:19:39,650 --> 03:19:40,750
Oh, I see what you mean!

3129
03:19:40,990 --> 03:19:43,750
Oh, because it's touching all three of these spaces and
there's nothing here.

3130
03:19:44,150 --> 03:19:44,370
Ah!

3131
03:19:44,950 --> 03:19:46,390
I see, I see, I see, I see.

3132
03:19:49,130 --> 03:19:50,590
I see, Kurim.

3133
03:19:53,190 --> 03:19:54,330
So then this is safe.

3134
03:19:55,710 --> 03:19:56,090
Yes.

3135
03:20:00,450 --> 03:20:01,750
Amtrak, thank you!

3136
03:20:02,730 --> 03:20:04,030
That was big YouTube!

3137
03:20:21,600 --> 03:20:26,220
These aren't like, these aren't speed run times, are they?

3138
03:20:29,790 --> 03:20:30,970
Oh good, thank goodness.

3139
03:20:31,710 --> 03:20:34,890
Thank you, thank you for gifting the membership so it
blocked my time.

3140
03:20:41,370 --> 03:20:48,290
for the flag of the I don't think any of these people were
streaming though when they when they beat it in 50 seconds

3141
03:20:48,290 --> 03:20:54,490
because I'm talking I'm not caught I have

3142
03:20:58,930 --> 03:21:10,590
93 left you're on world record pace I think I am I think I
am I'm gonna do it I'm gonna press it oh I'm

3143
03:21:14,360 --> 03:21:17,780
gonna eat a Kodoro for good luck okay I'm still trapped
though

3144
03:21:23,950 --> 03:21:26,370
More safe ones below the bottom one.

3145
03:21:26,550 --> 03:21:27,390
Oh, you're right!

3146
03:21:31,380 --> 03:21:32,200
I'm not gonna choke.

3147
03:21:38,430 --> 03:21:38,990
Oh my god.

3148
03:21:40,470 --> 03:21:40,890
One, two.

3149
03:21:41,470 --> 03:21:42,050
One, two, three.

3150
03:21:43,850 --> 03:21:44,550
We did it.

3151
03:21:50,350 --> 03:21:50,710
Nice.

3152
03:21:51,830 --> 03:21:53,490
It's still scary, though, everybody.

3153
03:21:54,590 --> 03:21:54,910
Please.

3154
03:21:55,710 --> 03:21:58,290
You might think I'm brave, but I'm actually very afraid.

3155
03:22:00,050 --> 03:22:01,730
I'm actually very scared, though.

3156
03:22:02,470 --> 03:22:03,990
The two is also safe.

3157
03:22:04,650 --> 03:22:15,030
I think you guys don't realize how many numbers are on this
board you can solve the three at the top wait this one how

3158
03:22:15,030 --> 03:22:39,150
it could be any three of these the one next to it gives it
away but it could be either of these look

3159
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:53,920
at them thank you don't just lurking don't mind me I don't
think you're lurking if you're Doing that.

3160
03:22:57,120 --> 03:22:58,720
That's advanced tactics.

3161
03:22:58,920 --> 03:23:00,980
You guys, I'm literally a kindergartner, okay?

3162
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:04,300
Right of three is safe.

3163
03:23:05,100 --> 03:23:06,480
I'm trusting you, one guy.

3164
03:23:07,640 --> 03:23:08,560

How did you know?

3167
03:23:21,250 --> 03:23:23,150
Three touches only one bomb.

3168
03:23:23,590 --> 03:23:32,470
Wait, three touches one known bomb, one touches one bomb

me that in Yu-Gi-Oh trust in the heart of the sweep

3179
03:25:25,800 --> 03:25:31,960
you can flag the corner block on the lower middle two with a
flag above it

3180
03:25:36,770 --> 03:25:46,670
this one you're right you are so correct you were so you
were so correct You were so accurate.

3181
03:25:58,840 --> 03:26:00,640
Then this one is safe.

I have to look for like many seconds.

3197
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:07,360
I'm learning, I'm learning though.

3198
03:27:07,760 --> 03:27:09,780
I really feel good that I'm learning.

3199
03:27:18,610 --> 03:27:20,350

I'm observing.

3229
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:36,060

3230
03:29:39,600 --> 03:29:40,980

3235
03:29:52,260 --> 03:29:52,440

3238
03:30:04,360 --> 03:30:05,360

03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:07,940

Okay.

3242
03:30:12,220 --> 03:30:13,840
I'm gonna click these three now.

3243
03:30:19,700 --> 03:30:21,280
This one is too scary!

3244
03:30:23,500 --> 03:30:25,200
This one is too scary!

3245
03:30:35,350 --> 03:30:36,130
It's free.

3246
03:30:36,250 --> 03:30:36,630
Trust.

3247
03:30:37,050 --> 03:30:37,310
Dang!

3248
03:30:40,430 --> 03:30:40,970
Scary.

3249
03:30:41,010 --> 03:30:55,110
that was the scariest moment of my afterlife we have one
tell me if I'm wrong one wait but then wait one one two

3250
03:30:55,110 --> 03:31:03,590
three is that correct correct dang we

3251
03:31:11,010 --> 03:31:22,130
have 84 slowly but surely wait so this is also good I'm
doubting my I'm doubting myself.

3252
03:31:22,350 --> 03:31:23,970
And so the ones are safe.

3253
03:31:26,010 --> 03:31:26,450
Oh,

3254
03:31:30,590 --> 03:31:30,890
wait.

3255
03:31:31,450 --> 03:31:33,150
Oh, I have to make a decision here.

3256
03:31:40,510 --> 03:31:43,050
It has to be this one is safe, right?

3257
03:31:44,290 --> 03:31:45,690
And this one is evil.

3258
03:31:46,890 --> 03:31:48,170
Wait, no, I'm a liar.

3259
03:31:48,450 --> 03:31:51,790
This one is this one and this one is safe.

3260
03:31:54,750 --> 03:31:55,910
I meant the other way around.

3261
03:31:58,030 --> 03:31:59,770
Because I'm sorry, I was looking at the tail.

3262
03:31:59,830 --> 03:32:00,030
Okay.

3263
03:32:02,430 --> 03:32:02,950
Then...

3264
03:32:03,850 --> 03:32:08,350
To beat the game, do you have to clear the board?

3265
03:32:08,470 --> 03:32:11,650
Like, say I just marked the correct bomb, but I never
touched that.

3266
03:32:11,950 --> 03:32:14,130
Would it still beat the game for me, or no?

3267
03:32:15,330 --> 03:32:16,950
You scared me.

3268
03:32:21,420 --> 03:32:23,120
You have to mark all the bombs.

3269
03:32:24,540 --> 03:32:25,640
You have to clear all tiles.

3270
03:32:26,440 --> 03:32:27,680
Mark every mine correctly.

3271
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:28,380
Oh.

3272
03:32:29,680 --> 03:32:32,000
You can win without ever using flags.

3273
03:32:32,060 --> 03:32:32,880
That's two.

3274
03:32:33,840 --> 03:32:34,640
Hell no.

3275
03:32:36,960 --> 03:32:38,200
One, two, three.

3276
03:32:39,500 --> 03:32:41,580
Oh my gosh, we're almost to the 70s.

3277
03:32:42,280 --> 03:32:43,320
So this is safe.

3278
03:32:43,780 --> 03:32:45,020
This is safe.

3279
03:32:45,540 --> 03:32:47,780
This is safe.

3280
03:32:47,860 --> 03:32:48,220
This is safe.

3281
03:32:49,280 --> 03:32:50,860
This is safe.

3282
03:32:51,240 --> 03:32:52,320
No, it's not.

3283
03:32:54,400 --> 03:32:54,600
Wait.

3284
03:32:57,730 --> 03:32:58,850
This is safe, though.

3285
03:33:03,900 --> 03:33:05,060
This is not safe.

3286
03:33:07,700 --> 03:33:10,080
That is not safe at all.

3287
03:33:11,080 --> 03:33:11,680
That's not safe.

3288
03:33:12,360 --> 03:33:13,400
This is safe.

3289
03:33:14,580 --> 03:33:14,720
DIN.

3290
03:33:15,580 --> 03:33:16,120
This is safe.

3291
03:33:18,140 --> 03:33:18,860
This is safe.

3292
03:33:19,220 --> 03:33:19,420
DIN.

3293
03:33:20,560 --> 03:33:21,160
This is safe.

3294
03:33:21,480 --> 03:33:21,680
DIN.

3295
03:33:25,960 --> 03:33:28,120
It's still too scared though.

3296
03:33:30,940 --> 03:33:32,300

If I can beat it in an hour, then it'll be New Year's.

If I can feed it in one hour, it will be New Year's.

3344
03:38:51,170 --> 03:38:52,230
Because that's four.

3345
03:38:56,550 --> 03:38:59,170

It wasn't locked?

3364
03:40:13,660 --> 03:40:14,480
I knew, I knew.

3365
03:40:14,860 --> 03:40:15,760
It wasn't a gamble!

3366
03:40:16,200 --> 03:40:17,160
It wasn't a gamble!

3367
03:40:18,820 --> 03:40:21,300

It's still too scary to do it though.

3372
03:40:38,340 --> 03:40:39,440
It's still way too scary.

3373
03:40:41,340 --> 03:40:41,740

If there was a fourth floor, it would be so spooky.

3525
03:51:00,700 --> 03:51:02,020
You don't mind restarting lots.

3526
03:51:02,140 --> 03:51:02,840
I guess that's true.

3527
03:51:03,660 --> 03:51:05,520
It breaks 50-50s.

3528
03:51:08,040 --> 03:51:11,060
I think I saw a stat that said corners are more likely to be
bombs.

3529
03:51:12,240 --> 03:51:12,540
Oh.

3530
03:51:15,860 --> 03:51:16,840
Look at the ones.

3531
03:51:17,740 --> 03:51:18,100
Safe.

3532
03:51:18,560 --> 03:51:20,400
Another five, guys.

3533
03:51:21,340 --> 03:51:22,880
It's too much pressure.

3534
03:51:23,240 --> 03:51:24,360
It's too much pressure.

3535
03:51:29,140 --> 03:51:30,960
One, two, three, four.

3536
03:51:31,020 --> 03:51:32,420
It has to be this, though.

3537
03:51:35,260 --> 03:51:35,740
Gasp

3538
03:51:44,170 --> 03:51:51,730

Did it?

3543
03:52:02,110 --> 03:52:03,430
Did it do the other four too?

3544
03:52:04,010 --> 03:52:13,970
One, two, three, four It did No way I'm Yu-Gi-Oh-ing it out
Guys, you guys, I can't stop Yu-Gi-Oh-ing out!

3545
03:52:16,270 --> 03:52:17,630
Wait, that's five.

3546
03:52:18,290 --> 03:52:19,390
One, two, wait.

3547
03:52:20,370 --> 03:52:21,250
Uh-oh, wait.

3548
03:52:22,570 --> 03:52:26,050
One, wait, one, two, three, four.

3549
03:52:27,330 --> 03:52:29,150
No, we're okay still, we're okay, right?

3550
03:52:31,330 --> 03:52:33,790
One, two, three, four.

3551
03:52:34,690 --> 03:52:35,410
We're okay still.

3552
03:52:40,500 --> 03:52:41,440
I'm good!

3553
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:42,240
Okay, okay.

3554
03:52:42,840 --> 03:52:45,080
I thought someone said it's five.

3555
03:52:49,100 --> 03:52:49,960
Okay, we're good.

3556
03:52:50,600 --> 03:52:52,020
So then this is okay.

3557
03:53:04,930 --> 03:53:06,770
One, two, three, four.

3558
03:53:10,230 --> 03:53:12,090
But I can...

3559
03:53:12,090 --> 03:53:13,210
No, no, sorry.

3560
03:53:13,970 --> 03:53:14,830
I can't do the three.

3561
03:53:15,410 --> 03:53:15,410
Oh,

3562
03:53:18,690 --> 03:53:19,610

3563
03:53:20,290 --> 03:53:20,490
One.

03:53:22,150 --> 03:53:22,730
And...

3565
03:53:22,750 --> 03:53:23,690
1.

3566
03:53:28,920 --> 03:53:29,720
I did it.

3567
03:53:33,160 --> 03:53:34,140
Clear the ones.

3568
03:53:34,340 --> 03:53:34,720
We cleared it.

3569
03:53:34,880 --> 03:53:35,340
We cleared it.

3570
03:53:35,600 --> 03:53:35,900
We're clear.

3571
03:53:36,100 --> 03:53:36,380
We're clear.

3572
03:53:36,600 --> 03:53:37,120
We're clear.

3573
03:53:37,540 --> 03:53:38,060
Area sweeped.

3574
03:53:38,240 --> 03:53:39,580
Area sweeped.

3575
03:53:41,240 --> 03:53:42,580
I declare thumb war.

3576
03:53:42,740 --> 03:53:46,360
What comes after the 5, 6, 7, 8 of the thumb war?

3577
03:53:47,660 --> 03:53:49,000
1, 2, 3, 4.

3578
03:53:49,400 --> 03:53:50,680
I declare thumb war.

3579
03:53:55,180 --> 03:53:56,680
What do you do?

3580
03:53:56,680 --> 03:53:59,080
try to keep your thumb straight

3581
03:54:03,540 --> 03:54:05,980
try to keep your thumb straight

3582
03:54:12,390 --> 03:54:22,710
I was I thought it was who do we appreciate I'm ignoring

3584
03:54:35,870 --> 03:54:37,370
Area is clear.

3585
03:54:39,910 --> 03:54:41,710
Which means I can do this too, right?

3586
03:54:45,210 --> 03:54:47,190
For this three, one, two, three.

3587
03:54:50,850 --> 03:54:51,290
Swipped.

3588
03:54:56,030 --> 03:54:57,110
Wait, what do you mean one more?

3589
03:54:57,350 --> 03:54:59,130
Which one, which, which other one is there?

3590
03:55:00,610 --> 03:55:01,510
Above the two.

3591
03:55:07,970 --> 03:55:09,830
Where's the more ones?

3592
03:55:10,530 --> 03:55:12,150
But I don't know this one yet.

3593

03:55:17,370 --> 03:55:18,030
Underwear.

3597
03:55:19,550 --> 03:55:20,450
Underwear.

3598
03:55:20,970 --> 03:55:21,250
Oh, wait.

3599
03:55:21,890 --> 03:55:22,010
No.

3600
03:55:22,170 --> 03:55:23,110
Oh, this one.

3601
03:55:24,390 --> 03:55:24,610
Didn't.

3602
03:55:26,730 --> 03:55:27,770
Oh, this one.

3603
03:55:31,600 --> 03:55:34,640
Area has been swept.

03:55:35,280 --> 03:55:36,660

03:56:53,430 --> 03:56:54,930
Oh, it can be this one.

3613
03:56:57,370 --> 03:56:59,970
Wait, just the top one.

3614
03:57:00,090 --> 03:57:01,850
Wait, how do you...

3615
03:57:01,850 --> 03:57:02,350
How do you know?

3616
03:57:04,280 --> 03:57:05,620
It could be either, right?

3617
03:57:09,090 --> 03:57:09,890
The second...

3618
03:57:09,890 --> 03:57:10,690
This one...

3619
03:57:10,690 --> 03:57:11,770
The top one is safe.

3620
03:57:12,970 --> 03:57:14,990
I'm getting lost in the sauce a little bit.

3621
03:57:15,830 --> 03:57:21,080
I got lost in the sauce.

3622
03:57:23,000 --> 03:57:23,980
Thank you.

3623
03:57:24,700 --> 03:57:25,760
Thank you, everybody.

3624
03:57:38,510 --> 03:57:39,350
Whew, saved.

3625
03:57:41,570 --> 03:57:41,910
This one?

3626
03:57:42,150 --> 03:57:42,670
Not safe.

3627
03:57:46,590 --> 03:57:48,550
Only have 37 bombs left.

3628
03:57:49,290 --> 03:57:49,910
Holy cow.

3629
03:57:51,850 --> 03:57:52,390
And this one?

3630
03:57:52,810 --> 03:57:53,410
Not safe.

3631
03:57:54,050 --> 03:57:55,030
36 bombs.

3632
03:57:56,670 --> 03:57:57,650
Crisis averted.

3633
03:57:57,730 --> 03:57:58,310
We did it, guys.

3634
03:57:58,450 --> 03:57:59,550
The evil is defeated.

3635
03:58:02,430 --> 03:58:03,350
I have one hour.

3636
03:58:04,090 --> 03:58:06,730
As long as I beat this one, I will complete my goal.

3637
03:58:09,010 --> 03:58:12,710
Of beating Mind Sweeper in 2025.

3638
03:58:25,760 --> 03:58:27,200
There's another isolated three.

3639
03:58:31,920 --> 03:58:32,680
This one.

3640
03:58:34,120 --> 03:58:35,040
No, yes.

3641
03:58:36,700 --> 03:58:37,140
This one?

3642
03:58:37,560 --> 03:58:38,900
One, two, three.

3643
03:58:39,380 --> 03:58:39,780
That one?

3644
03:58:53,100 --> 03:58:55,540
I should start making that sound effect.

3645
03:58:55,680 --> 03:58:57,040
It sounds like an explosion.

3646
03:59:00,810 --> 03:59:01,870
One, two, three.

3647
03:59:02,990 --> 03:59:04,410
Oh, wait, I did it again.

3648
03:59:10,890 --> 03:59:12,330
That's scary me.

3649
03:59:12,470 --> 03:59:14,750
One, two, three, four.

3650
03:59:15,490 --> 03:59:15,630
Okay.

3651
03:59:18,210 --> 03:59:19,170
Another five.

3652
03:59:20,870 --> 03:59:21,310
Evil.

3653
03:59:21,910 --> 03:59:22,930
Okay, wait, this one.

3654
03:59:23,150 --> 03:59:23,390
Right?

3655
03:59:25,430 --> 03:59:25,870
One, two, three.

3656
03:59:28,050 --> 03:59:29,050
This is two.

3657
03:59:29,290 --> 03:59:31,150
Okay, okay, okay.

3658
03:59:33,630 --> 03:59:34,730
Okay, okay, okay.

3659
03:59:36,830 --> 03:59:39,610
Oh my gosh, one more hour until the new year!

3660
03:59:40,210 --> 03:59:42,490
I don't think I'm gonna nap before the collab, but I'm
feeling okay.

3661
03:59:42,690 --> 03:59:44,170
As long as I eat, I think I'll be alright.

3662
03:59:47,010 --> 03:59:48,930
As long as I eat, I think I'll be alright.

3663
03:59:51,010 --> 03:59:51,150
Boop!

3664
03:59:54,970 --> 03:59:55,370
Boop!

3665
04:00:05,140 --> 04:00:07,760
Oh my god, oh my god, okay.

3666
04:00:10,580 --> 04:00:11,480
Oh gosh.

3667
04:00:13,740 --> 04:00:15,620
You can brag about your win during the collab.

3668
04:00:15,840 --> 04:00:17,900
I bet no one else has ever beat Mind Sweeper.

3669
04:00:18,320 --> 04:00:19,660
Don't look at the scores down there.

3670
04:00:20,080 --> 04:00:21,980
They're task bots.

3671
04:00:22,180 --> 04:00:23,260
They don't count.

3672
04:00:30,420 --> 04:00:31,700
This one is okay.

3673
04:00:36,630 --> 04:00:37,910
It's so scary.

3674
04:00:38,470 --> 04:00:40,210
I'll never get over how scary this is.

3675
04:00:41,090 --> 04:00:42,270
This one is also...

3676
04:00:43,190 --> 04:00:45,270
Wait, this one's also okay.

3677
04:00:48,430 --> 04:00:49,330
Actually, nope.

3678
04:00:50,730 --> 04:00:52,690
Yeah, all of these are my alt accounts.

3679
04:00:55,850 --> 04:00:57,030
This one, okay.

3680
04:01:04,320 --> 04:01:06,500
This one, not safe.

3681
04:01:14,300 --> 04:01:15,840
So then this one is safe?

3682
04:01:16,420 --> 04:01:16,760
Yeah.

3683
04:01:17,060 --> 04:01:17,980
Wait, is this one safe?

3684
04:01:18,660 --> 04:01:20,100
That's too scary for me to click.

3685
04:01:21,880 --> 04:01:23,000
I'm just gonna leave it alone.

3686
04:01:24,060 --> 04:01:27,580
Oh, it hurts.

3687
04:01:27,900 --> 04:01:28,540
Oh, so scary.

3688
04:01:29,020 --> 04:01:29,840
Oh my god.

3689
04:01:33,820 --> 04:01:34,460
Okay.

3690
04:01:35,540 --> 04:01:36,340
This one's safe.

3691
04:01:40,730 --> 04:01:41,070
This one?

3692
04:01:41,510 --> 04:01:41,750
Safe.

3693
04:01:46,690 --> 04:01:47,610
Check the threes.

3694
04:01:48,050 --> 04:01:48,490
What threes?

3695
04:01:49,910 --> 04:01:51,370
The threes, knees.

3696
04:01:54,150 --> 04:01:54,750
And above?

3697
04:01:55,110 --> 04:01:55,790
Oh yes, and above.

3698
04:01:56,370 --> 04:01:57,010
Thank you.

3699
04:02:00,730 --> 04:02:02,370
This one's also safe.

3700
04:02:08,330 --> 04:02:08,850
Holy cow.

3701
04:02:09,330 --> 04:02:10,290
Everything is...

3702
04:02:10,290 --> 04:02:13,310
We still have 30 bombs left in so little...

3703
04:02:13,310 --> 04:02:14,630
So little slots.

3704
04:02:14,850 --> 04:02:15,930
It's kind of insanity.

3705
04:02:26,710 --> 04:02:28,410
I am afraid for you.

3706
04:02:28,570 --> 04:02:29,250
Yeah, I believe.

3707
04:02:32,350 --> 04:02:33,330
It gets harder.

3708
04:02:34,210 --> 04:02:34,450
Wait.

3709
04:02:34,670 --> 04:02:35,630
Oh, no, never mind.

3710
04:02:35,870 --> 04:02:37,570
I was about to do something stupid.

3711
04:02:44,740 --> 04:02:48,200
Oh, I don't know where to go from here.

3712
04:02:53,160 --> 04:02:54,280
This is safe.

3713
04:02:55,560 --> 04:02:56,180
One, two.

3714
04:03:02,040 --> 04:03:02,580
One, two.

3715
04:03:02,760 --> 04:03:03,540
This is safe.

3716
04:03:08,660 --> 04:03:09,640
This is bad.

3717
04:03:14,470 --> 04:03:16,230
You could do the long line of twos.

3718
04:03:16,430 --> 04:03:17,370
I'm too scared.

3719
04:03:20,010 --> 04:03:21,470
I'm kind of doing only two.

3720
04:03:21,490 --> 04:03:23,630
Only the ones that I feel comfortable with.

3721
04:03:25,230 --> 04:03:26,390
Check around the road too.

3722
04:03:26,590 --> 04:03:27,870
Wait, not yet, not yet!

3723
04:03:28,190 --> 04:03:29,030
Not yet, not yet!

3724
04:03:30,030 --> 04:03:30,290
Boom.

3725
04:03:34,140 --> 04:03:34,540
Dadoom.

3726
04:03:37,660 --> 04:03:38,160
Dadoom.

3727
04:03:38,900 --> 04:03:39,160
Okay.

3728
04:03:44,180 --> 04:03:46,880
Try clicking the one some versions auto clears.

3729
04:03:47,840 --> 04:03:48,280
The one?

3730
04:03:48,740 --> 04:03:49,340
Wait, what one?

3731
04:03:54,110 --> 04:03:55,790
My heart is beating fast.

3732
04:03:56,770 --> 04:03:57,890
Yeah, me too!

3733
04:04:05,160 --> 04:04:07,620
Okay, this one is definitely not good.

3734
04:04:13,720 --> 04:04:16,480
Mito's brain expanding before our eyes.

3735
04:04:17,040 --> 04:04:20,720
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm getting smarter, mom.

3736
04:04:23,460 --> 04:04:24,800
This two is safe.

3737
04:04:28,080 --> 04:04:30,160
I say things out loud, but I don't believe them.

3738
04:04:31,540 --> 04:04:33,480
This one is safe.

3739
04:04:33,860 --> 04:04:37,780
Two, do I go, thank you.

3740
04:04:38,240 --> 04:04:41,100
Mito grew three sizes that day, talking about your mind
sweeping.

3741
04:04:50,540 --> 04:04:52,760
Gotta hear it to decide if it's true.

3742
04:04:53,040 --> 04:04:53,500
Yeah, exactly.

3743
04:04:54,020 --> 04:04:55,480
This one, it's safe.

3744
04:04:57,860 --> 04:04:59,280
Oh, round here, though, also.

3745
04:05:05,010 --> 04:05:08,230
The three is full of mines.

3746
04:05:08,990 --> 04:05:10,850
There's threes everywhere.

3747
04:05:11,410 --> 04:05:13,450
I don't know which one you're talking about.

3748
04:05:20,610 --> 04:05:21,290
Safe.

3749
04:05:23,310 --> 04:05:24,330
And safe.

3750
04:05:31,860 --> 04:05:34,520
It's going to be devastating if we end with a 50-50.

3751
04:05:35,580 --> 04:05:40,960
If we end with a 50-50, that'll just be the way.

3752
04:05:44,700 --> 04:05:45,380
Spoiler alert.

3753
04:05:45,760 --> 04:05:46,580
Threes are red.

3754
04:06:00,260 --> 04:06:00,760
This one?

3755
04:06:01,680 --> 04:06:02,000
Safe.

3756
04:06:02,460 --> 04:06:03,120
Oh, God.

3757
04:06:03,640 --> 04:06:04,760
I didn't believe myself.

3758
04:06:05,520 --> 04:06:05,940
One.

3759
04:06:07,480 --> 04:06:09,480
One, two, three.

3760
04:06:21,590 --> 04:06:22,730
Lupine, that is me too.

3761
04:06:23,390 --> 04:06:24,870
Like the fingers over my eyes.

3762
04:06:25,050 --> 04:06:26,010
I'm just like...

3763
04:06:26,010 --> 04:06:27,990
I can't look.

3764
04:06:28,870 --> 04:06:29,590
I can't look.

3765
04:06:29,790 --> 04:06:30,550
It's too scary.

3766
04:06:34,610 --> 04:06:35,330
Okay.

3767
04:06:36,070 --> 04:06:37,610
We're closing in.

3768
04:06:40,350 --> 04:06:42,430
The two near the four is safe.

3769
04:06:51,150 --> 04:06:51,750
This...

3770
04:06:51,750 --> 04:06:52,070
What?

3771
04:06:57,830 --> 04:06:59,810
Oh, this one is safe.

3772
04:07:05,680 --> 04:07:06,820
Not safe.

3773
04:07:07,640 --> 04:07:09,360
But then also, safe.

3774
04:07:22,680 --> 04:07:25,120
Have we tried clicking the gray tiles?

3775
04:07:25,740 --> 04:07:27,020
Yeah, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

3776
04:07:36,780 --> 04:07:38,800
You can figure out the top right twos.

3777
04:07:40,980 --> 04:07:41,300
This?

3778
04:07:41,520 --> 04:07:43,040
These twos here?

3779
04:07:58,230 --> 04:07:59,670
Places without minds are safe.

3780
04:07:59,750 --> 04:08:00,830
Where's my mind detector?

3781
04:08:02,270 --> 04:08:03,190
Am I a dog?

3782
04:08:04,310 --> 04:08:04,550
Oh, wait.

3783
04:08:04,690 --> 04:08:05,490
This is not safe.

3784
04:08:09,470 --> 04:08:10,630
Which means this.

3785
04:08:12,370 --> 04:08:12,850
Six!

3786
04:08:17,150 --> 04:08:20,890
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3787
04:08:22,470 --> 04:08:22,870
Oh!

3788
04:08:34,380 --> 04:08:36,080
One, two, three, four.

3789
04:08:36,420 --> 04:08:36,680
Safe.

3790
04:08:44,490 --> 04:08:45,210
We're going...

3791
04:08:45,210 --> 04:08:47,470
You guys remember when I said I want to get to fifth?

3792
04:08:47,510 --> 04:08:49,170
We're almost at 20!

3793
04:09:11,360 --> 04:09:16,370
These are safe.

3794
04:09:17,930 --> 04:09:18,650
Because one, two.

3795
04:09:20,530 --> 04:09:22,790
I clicked them so fast.

3796
04:09:30,390 --> 04:09:32,510
Okay, we're closing in, everybody.

3797
04:09:32,750 --> 04:09:33,830
We're closing in.

3798
04:09:37,680 --> 04:09:39,420
I have 50 minutes to beat this.

3799
04:09:41,060 --> 04:09:45,620
I don't know if I'll beat it in 50 minutes, even though we
only have 21 left.

3800
04:09:49,900 --> 04:09:52,240
I'm not ready for the line of two, you guys.

3801
04:09:52,440 --> 04:09:53,260
I don't know yet.

3802
04:09:53,480 --> 04:09:56,020
You say I can beat the line of twos, I don't understand.

3803
04:09:58,000 --> 04:09:58,600
I don't know.

3804
04:10:10,460 --> 04:10:12,220
Like, you know, I don't see what you guys are saying.

3805
04:10:31,550 --> 04:10:33,550
I'm not seeing at all what you guys are saying.

3806
04:10:42,770 --> 04:10:44,210
This one has to be.

3807
04:10:44,550 --> 04:10:45,310
Because 2-2.

3808
04:10:45,610 --> 04:10:46,190
I see it.

3809
04:10:49,330 --> 04:10:50,450
Which means...

3810
04:10:50,450 --> 04:10:51,610
This one is safe.

3811
04:10:57,300 --> 04:10:57,860
Okay.

3812
04:10:59,240 --> 04:11:00,440
To this one.

3813
04:11:01,460 --> 04:11:02,080
Like that.

3814
04:11:03,520 --> 04:11:04,320
Okay, okay.

3815
04:11:05,120 --> 04:11:06,080
Okay, which means...

3816
04:11:09,880 --> 04:11:11,600
These are all safe then, no?

3817
04:11:12,060 --> 04:11:12,980
All three of these?

3818
04:11:13,580 --> 04:11:14,060
Wait, no?

3819
04:11:16,340 --> 04:11:17,500
Oh, you're right, you're right.

3820
04:11:17,600 --> 04:11:17,980
Just kidding.

3821
04:11:18,260 --> 04:11:19,120
I see it, I see it.

3822
04:11:19,860 --> 04:11:21,860
But then that means this is safe.

3823
04:11:28,670 --> 04:11:29,650
I'm stressed out.

3824
04:11:29,790 --> 04:11:30,190
I'm stressed.

3825
04:11:30,330 --> 04:11:31,450
I'm stressing even more.

3826
04:11:31,530 --> 04:11:32,470
I'm the stressedest.

3827
04:11:32,870 --> 04:11:33,570
I'm stressed.

3828
04:11:34,310 --> 04:11:35,270
Just out.

3829
04:11:42,620 --> 04:11:45,000
One, two, three.

3830
04:11:45,360 --> 04:11:46,120
This is safe.

3831
04:11:52,320 --> 04:11:53,700
One, two, three.

3832
04:11:56,540 --> 04:11:59,000
All three of these are safe.

3833
04:12:11,730 --> 04:12:12,110
Oh, wait.

3834
04:12:12,550 --> 04:12:14,210
One, two, three, so it's safe.

3835
04:12:14,410 --> 04:12:14,970
Oh my god.

3836
04:12:17,170 --> 04:12:19,810
So, one, two, three, four.

3837
04:12:21,810 --> 04:12:22,290
Okay.

3838
04:12:23,090 --> 04:12:23,510
All right.

3839
04:12:25,110 --> 04:12:25,830
We're making progress.

3840
04:12:25,990 --> 04:12:27,150
We're making good progress, everybody.

3841
04:12:28,350 --> 04:12:29,370
We're making good progress.

3842
04:12:31,910 --> 04:12:32,990
This is safe.

3843
04:12:33,210 --> 04:12:34,990
One, two, three, safe.

3844
04:12:37,170 --> 04:12:44,390
My scariest thing is if I place a thing wrong, a flag wrong,
and so I say one, two, three, safe, but it's not actually

3845
04:12:44,390 --> 04:12:45,210
safe.

3846
04:12:45,850 --> 04:12:48,030
Then who was fallen?

3847
04:12:49,530 --> 04:12:50,810
One, two, three.

3848
04:13:02,620 --> 04:13:03,580
That's the thrill.

3849
04:13:03,780 --> 04:13:04,960
I think I'm too scared now.

3850
04:13:05,840 --> 04:13:08,500
I was having a good old time when it was nice and full.

3851
04:13:08,800 --> 04:13:10,440
I mean nice and empty, but now I'm scared.

3852
04:13:11,880 --> 04:13:12,820
Not a very pro gamer.

3853
04:13:12,960 --> 04:13:14,420
Welcome to Membushhip.

3854
04:13:14,520 --> 04:13:15,480
Thank you.

3855
04:13:16,580 --> 04:13:18,200
Yeah, scared if you misclick something.

3856
04:13:18,300 --> 04:13:19,040
Yeah, exactly.

3857
04:13:20,360 --> 04:13:20,800
Exactly.

3858
04:13:30,300 --> 04:13:31,260
One, two.

3859
04:13:31,460 --> 04:13:32,580
This must be one.

3860
04:13:42,660 --> 04:13:43,020
Come on.

3861
04:13:43,140 --> 04:13:47,560
Now I just have to decide which one is the scariest.

3862
04:13:47,580 --> 04:14:01,460
one here uh this one is the scary one and this one is clean
oh my god

3863
04:14:09,200 --> 04:14:21,200
one two three that's one two three four which means these
two are safe right No.

3864
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:22,200
Wait.

3865
04:14:23,100 --> 04:14:23,400
Wrong.

3866
04:14:23,760 --> 04:14:24,520
What did I do wrong?

3867
04:14:25,400 --> 04:14:25,800
Oh.

3868
04:14:26,480 --> 04:14:27,240
Oh, wait.

3869
04:14:27,320 --> 04:14:28,460
This is the one I just did, right?

3870
04:14:29,320 --> 04:14:30,380
So, one, two.

3871
04:14:30,420 --> 04:14:31,540
Oh, I missed this one.

3872
04:14:31,760 --> 04:14:32,280
Thank you, guys.

3873
04:14:32,420 --> 04:14:32,720
Thank you.

3874
04:14:32,960 --> 04:14:33,820
So, this one is safe.

3875
04:14:34,100 --> 04:14:34,840
And then it's these two.

3876
04:14:36,660 --> 04:14:37,140
Or no.

3877
04:14:37,500 --> 04:14:37,780
One.

3878
04:14:38,060 --> 04:14:39,080
It has to be only one.

3879
04:14:39,360 --> 04:14:39,500
Wait.

3880
04:14:39,780 --> 04:14:40,100
Safe.

3881
04:14:42,660 --> 04:14:43,060
One.

3882
04:14:44,180 --> 04:14:44,820
Let's see.

3883
04:14:45,280 --> 04:14:45,680
Okay.

3884
04:14:45,860 --> 04:14:46,680
Time to do math.

3885
04:14:47,080 --> 04:14:47,260
Maybe.

3886
04:14:48,340 --> 04:14:49,180
It's this one.

3887
04:15:01,950 --> 04:15:29,690
safe one last corner oh my gosh this is safe because one two
three okay one two three four six okay slow and steady Minto

3888
04:15:29,690 --> 04:15:38,810
yes yes slow and steady slow and steady is honestly, I mean,
is saving me, so I would have died a long time ago.

3889
04:15:38,810 --> 04:15:44,530
I would have died so long ago, I think, but but we're okay.

3890
04:15:46,910 --> 04:15:48,050
We're fine-ish.

3891
04:15:59,810 --> 04:16:00,990
A win is a win, maybe.

3892
04:16:05,740 --> 04:16:06,980
You're a suit.

3893
04:16:08,420 --> 04:16:09,660
Dodeca, thank you!

3894
04:16:09,980 --> 04:16:10,740
Happy New Year!

3895
04:16:10,860 --> 04:16:12,540
It's nice to see you learn the ropes, Gumbare.

3896
04:16:12,680 --> 04:16:18,040
For hardcore puzzle enthusiasts, there is a brilliant game
called 19 Mind Sweeper variants on Steam.

3897
04:16:18,640 --> 04:16:20,820
Thank you for raising Mind Sweeper awareness.

3898
04:16:21,240 --> 04:16:21,840
Of course!

3899
04:16:24,080 --> 04:16:25,460
Of course, of course!

3900
04:16:28,860 --> 04:16:30,040
You're a suit.

3901
04:16:33,060 --> 04:16:33,620
Okay, hold on.

3902
04:16:33,660 --> 04:16:37,000
I'm trying to find any sort of rope that I can grasp onto.

3903
04:16:37,480 --> 04:16:37,660
Wait!

3904
04:16:38,160 --> 04:16:38,680
One, two.

3905
04:16:38,780 --> 04:16:39,620
This one is safe.

3906
04:16:44,930 --> 04:16:45,930
Watch me one, two.

3907
04:16:52,130 --> 04:16:54,890
Yeah, buddy, yeah, buddy, yeah, buddy.

3908
04:16:55,170 --> 04:16:56,210
Yeah, buddy, yeah, buddy.

3909
04:17:06,350 --> 04:17:07,410
Wait, I have to guess?

3910
04:17:10,610 --> 04:17:12,250
Wait, what do you mean I'm down to guessing?

3911
04:17:15,630 --> 04:17:16,950
Wait, what do you mean I have to guess?

3912
04:17:18,010 --> 04:17:19,230
Wait, what do you mean I have to guess?

3913
04:17:20,410 --> 04:17:21,810
Above four is danger.

3914
04:17:22,790 --> 04:17:23,630
Four is danger.

3915
04:17:24,450 --> 04:17:25,010
I have to guess.

3916
04:17:25,050 --> 04:17:28,570
You have to take a guess now to advance

3917
04:18:08,140 --> 04:18:11,380
I'm looking around I'm grasping at straws

3918
04:18:16,160 --> 04:18:17,640
Be strong, Minto

3919
04:18:21,000 --> 04:18:26,300
Two more flags above the top five How do you know though?

3920
04:18:26,640 --> 04:18:27,080
This?

3921
04:18:27,860 --> 04:18:28,740
How do you know?

3922
04:18:32,780 --> 04:18:33,500
How do you know?

3923
04:18:41,860 --> 04:18:42,800
Right here?

3924
04:18:43,160 --> 04:18:46,250
Wait, but one...

3925
04:18:46,250 --> 04:18:46,890
No, it's two.

3926
04:18:46,910 --> 04:18:52,030
many wait oh wait wait but

3927
04:18:55,700 --> 04:19:06,620
how do you know it's not the wait huh those top two are
confirmed but how I don't know how I don't know how they're

3928
04:19:06,620 --> 04:19:09,560
confirmed because

3929
04:19:19,370 --> 04:19:42,180
of the bottom five who because the last mine is shared oh
okay okay okay oh so it's either it has to be this one or

3930
04:19:42,180 --> 04:19:50,100
this one or this one oh my gosh you guys are applying really
big brain logic here

3931
04:19:59,000 --> 04:20:04,680
okay well we got rid of some i'll take it

3932
04:20:10,130 --> 04:20:12,410
now it's time for 50 50

3933
04:20:20,190 --> 04:20:34,780
hold on i need some like i need some like music here the
song is called thinking time I

3934
04:20:43,440 --> 04:20:50,660
can't take it seriously I'm scared

3935
04:21:23,660 --> 04:21:42,880
we praise everybody we praise I need only Minto pray emotes
if you have member ship and other and regular praying if you

3936
04:21:42,880 --> 04:21:46,500
don't have a membership even

3937
04:21:50,550 --> 04:21:57,430
though smiley face is like oh here I go three two

3938
04:22:07,340 --> 04:22:11,580
we manifested we manifested

3939
04:22:19,200 --> 04:22:21,560
um can I do anything with that

3940
04:22:25,020 --> 04:22:26,640
What did that do though?

3941
04:22:27,380 --> 04:22:28,880
Um, it wasn't a bomb?

3942
04:22:32,220 --> 04:22:32,900
Uh...

3943
04:22:43,290 --> 04:22:45,130
Yeah, we didn't die?

3944
04:22:46,470 --> 04:22:47,810
What is this song?

3945
04:22:47,910 --> 04:22:48,410
It's awesome?

3946
04:22:48,570 --> 04:22:49,750
It's from Dova Syndrome.

3947
04:22:51,970 --> 04:22:53,810
It's called Thinking Time.

3948
04:22:54,950 --> 04:22:55,830
Alright, there we go.

3949
04:22:59,890 --> 04:23:01,650
We did not die.

3950
04:23:14,270 --> 04:23:15,590
I'm scared though.

3951
04:23:17,170 --> 04:23:18,850
How do I work with this?

3952
04:23:22,450 --> 04:23:24,210
I think I have to guess again, no?

3953
04:23:40,140 --> 04:23:41,680
Top of two is a mine.

3954
04:23:42,600 --> 04:23:43,380
I thought that.

3955
04:23:43,560 --> 04:23:44,880
But I know it's a shared mine.

3956
04:23:45,060 --> 04:23:46,520
But why couldn't it be this one, you know?

3957
04:23:46,700 --> 04:23:48,020
Because then it would share with the three.

3958
04:23:50,520 --> 04:23:52,980
So I don't want to quite just be like this is...

3959
04:23:52,980 --> 04:23:54,060
This is...

3960
04:23:54,060 --> 04:23:54,420
Right?

3961
04:23:55,340 --> 04:23:55,700
Like...

3962
04:24:04,240 --> 04:24:05,460
And then it could be like...

3963
04:24:05,460 --> 04:24:08,000
Well, I guess it can't be that if it were to that.

3964
04:24:19,140 --> 04:24:20,460
Right of top two is a mine.

3965
04:24:20,780 --> 04:24:21,080
Really?

3966
04:24:21,160 --> 04:24:21,720
This one?

3967
04:24:24,580 --> 04:24:27,040
4 wouldn't work Wait, what do you mean 4 wouldn't work?

3968
04:24:35,310 --> 04:24:40,550
Must be a mine that shares the other two spaces With a 3
That only has one undiscovered

3969
04:24:45,040 --> 04:24:58,920
Okay I think I get it So it could be like this one and this
one Or like this one and this one And then this one or

3970
04:24:58,920 --> 04:25:20,100
something I think it takes me a second to...

3971
04:25:20,100 --> 04:25:22,040
I get it, but I don't get it at the same time.

3972
04:25:22,340 --> 04:25:23,860
Like, I get it, but I don't get it.

3973
04:25:26,680 --> 04:25:28,960
Oh my god, I only have 30...

3974
04:25:28,960 --> 04:25:30,660
35 minutes, you guys!

3975
04:25:37,330 --> 04:25:38,910
It's really hard to visualize.

3976
04:25:39,170 --> 04:25:39,950
Yeah, yeah.

3977
04:25:43,270 --> 04:25:44,950
These are advanced strats.

3978
04:25:45,310 --> 04:25:46,710
I don't get it.

3979
04:25:49,410 --> 04:25:50,970
Do I have to guess again?

3980
04:25:54,050 --> 04:25:56,830
You gotta guess near a 4 or a 5.

3981
04:25:57,130 --> 04:25:57,450
Yeah.

3982
04:25:59,090 --> 04:26:00,630
4's top right is safe.

3983
04:26:00,770 --> 04:26:01,230
This one?

3984
04:26:01,830 --> 04:26:02,490
How do you know?

3985
04:26:04,930 --> 04:26:05,850
How do you know?

3986
04:26:08,610 --> 04:26:09,770
No guessing yet.

3987
04:26:10,270 --> 04:26:10,830
Wait, where?

3988
04:26:10,950 --> 04:26:12,050
How do you calculate that?

3989
04:26:24,740 --> 04:26:25,880
Because of the 2?

3990
04:26:27,260 --> 04:26:29,360
These are too advanced for me, everybody.

3991
04:26:29,880 --> 04:26:30,680
I'm gonna click it!

3992
04:26:30,760 --> 04:26:31,720
I'm gonna click right here!

3993
04:26:32,080 --> 04:26:32,680
I'm sad.

3994
04:26:33,560 --> 04:26:37,780
My brain is like seriously like frizzing out.

3995
04:26:45,660 --> 04:26:47,640
Okay, I'm going to click this one right here.

3996
04:26:49,180 --> 04:26:49,600
Whoa!

3997
04:26:52,480 --> 04:26:56,060
So then one, two, three.

3998
04:26:57,840 --> 04:26:58,000
I

3999
04:27:02,050 --> 04:27:03,490
don't know how you guys did that.

4000
04:27:05,190 --> 04:27:07,530
I have no idea how you guys did that.

4001
04:27:11,150 --> 04:27:17,870
three, four, one, two, one.

4002
04:27:20,210 --> 04:27:21,990
This one is also safe.

4003
04:27:25,230 --> 04:27:25,910
Safe.

4004
04:27:35,550 --> 04:27:37,550
I'm relying on you guys like hardcore.

4005
04:27:38,330 --> 04:27:40,310
One, two, three, so safe.

4006
04:27:42,150 --> 04:27:44,690
One, two, three, four, five, safe.

4007
04:27:50,510 --> 04:27:50,950
Um...

4008
04:27:50,950 --> 04:27:52,450
One, two, three...

4009
04:27:53,250 --> 04:27:56,450
One, two, three, four...

4010
04:27:57,850 --> 04:27:58,290
Uh...

4011
04:27:58,290 --> 04:27:59,510
Oh, this one is also clear.

4012
04:28:01,550 --> 04:28:01,990
Uh...

4013
04:28:02,750 --> 04:28:03,630
One, two...

4014
04:28:03,630 --> 04:28:05,930
Oh my god, I almost left click right...

4015
04:28:05,930 --> 04:28:07,450
Wait, not... No, just kidding.

4016
04:28:11,670 --> 04:28:12,710
There we go.

4017
04:28:12,890 --> 04:28:13,090
Okay.

4018
04:28:14,350 --> 04:28:15,390
I caught myself!

4019
04:28:15,510 --> 04:28:16,110
I caught myself!

4020
04:28:16,270 --> 04:28:16,810
I caught myself!

4021
04:28:17,090 --> 04:28:17,170
I caught myself!

4022
04:28:18,450 --> 04:28:19,550
I caught it!

4023
04:28:20,050 --> 04:28:21,390
I caught it!

4024
04:28:21,450 --> 04:28:22,190
I caught it!

4025
04:28:22,630 --> 04:28:23,110
I caught it!

4026
04:28:24,750 --> 04:28:25,370
I'm...

4027
04:28:25,370 --> 04:28:28,050
One, two, three, four, five.

4028
04:28:28,870 --> 04:28:29,230
Okay.

4029
04:28:39,650 --> 04:28:42,250
Two, four, corner...

4030
04:28:42,250 --> 04:28:42,710
Oh?

4031
04:28:42,870 --> 04:28:45,050
There's two, four, corner two.

4032
04:28:46,730 --> 04:28:47,110
Whoa.

4033
04:28:52,000 --> 04:28:53,420
Okay, hold on.

4034
04:28:53,820 --> 04:28:54,440
Uh...

4035
04:28:55,800 --> 04:28:57,580
Oh, this one is... There we go.

4036
04:28:57,740 --> 04:28:58,640
Okay, so yes.

4037
04:28:58,840 --> 04:28:59,020
Okay.

4038
04:28:59,500 --> 04:29:01,120
One, two, three, four!

4039
04:29:01,260 --> 04:29:02,520
So this one is Boom.

4040
04:29:05,100 --> 04:29:07,220
If not boom, as in a bomb going off.

4041
04:29:12,940 --> 04:29:14,960
Just to be, just to clarify.

4042
04:29:18,180 --> 04:29:22,160
It's, it's, it's, okay, we have just seven left.

4043
04:29:22,340 --> 04:29:23,000
Oh my gosh.

4044
04:29:24,060 --> 04:29:27,140
Oh, our board has abs.

4045
04:29:40,320 --> 04:29:41,160
Directly right.

4046
04:29:41,180 --> 04:29:42,520
of two is safe.

4047
04:29:43,880 --> 04:29:44,140
This one?

4048
04:29:44,300 --> 04:29:44,440
This?

4049
04:29:44,700 --> 04:29:45,200
This one?

4050
04:29:47,080 --> 04:29:47,800
How do you know?

4051
04:29:53,110 --> 04:29:54,570
Someone, please explain.

4052
04:29:56,050 --> 04:29:57,970
Because of the two ones above it.

4053
04:30:11,430 --> 04:30:11,510
Oh!

4054
04:30:12,550 --> 04:30:17,250
Oh, because it would be sharing here and then if it were
this one, it would have to be sharing there.

4055
04:30:19,050 --> 04:30:19,530
Or...

4056
04:30:23,090 --> 04:30:24,890
This one's a bit harder to explain.

4057
04:30:25,030 --> 04:30:25,610
Just trust.

4058
04:30:26,110 --> 04:30:28,070
Yeah, I got I think I understood.

4059
04:30:28,390 --> 04:30:28,930
It's difficult.

4060
04:30:29,090 --> 04:30:32,750
It's still hard for me to visualize, but I think I
understood.

4061
04:30:33,990 --> 04:30:34,690
I think so.

4062
04:30:36,390 --> 04:30:37,270
It's hard.

4063
04:30:37,650 --> 04:30:38,410
This is hard.

4064
04:30:38,630 --> 04:30:42,730
I'm going to go play Meow Tower right after this, so I feel
smart again.

4065
04:30:46,110 --> 04:30:47,370
I'm going to play Meow Tower.

4066
04:30:47,410 --> 04:30:48,870
We only have 30 minutes, you guys.

4067
04:30:49,030 --> 04:30:49,790
Oh my gosh.

4068
04:30:50,130 --> 04:30:51,670
I'm starting to get a migraine again.

4069
04:30:54,170 --> 04:30:55,170
I need to eat.

4070
04:30:56,270 --> 04:30:58,990
Do you guys mind if I Wait, no, but I have to cook it
myself.

4071
04:31:01,350 --> 04:31:02,930
I'm gonna go get some water real quick.

4072
04:31:03,630 --> 04:31:04,430
I'll be right back.

4073
04:31:04,550 --> 04:31:05,190
Let me get some water.

4074
04:31:05,410 --> 04:31:06,990
And I'm gonna heat up my oven.

4075
04:31:07,310 --> 04:31:08,190
I'll be right back.

4076
04:32:34,300 --> 04:32:34,780
Okay.

4077
04:32:35,880 --> 04:32:36,300
Okay.

4078
04:32:46,020 --> 04:32:46,980
Welcome back.

4079
04:32:47,460 --> 04:32:47,940
Tadaima!

4080
04:32:51,000 --> 04:32:52,260
It's guessing time again.

4081
04:32:58,720 --> 04:33:00,360
Is it guessing time again?

4082
04:33:18,040 --> 04:33:20,760
Area near 4, 5, 5 should be solvable.

4083
04:33:22,800 --> 04:33:23,160
Should it?

4084
04:33:24,180 --> 04:33:26,380
1, 2, 3, 4.

4085
04:33:26,640 --> 04:33:28,820
I don't know where else to put a thing, though.

4086
04:33:30,380 --> 04:33:31,000
Like...

4087
04:33:31,000 --> 04:33:32,160
And then...

4088
04:33:32,160 --> 04:33:35,200
1, 2, 3, 4.

4089
04:33:36,400 --> 04:33:37,920
Just one of these.

4090
04:33:49,400 --> 04:33:49,920
Yeah.

4091
04:33:55,750 --> 04:33:56,490
Not solvable.

4092
04:33:56,510 --> 04:33:57,190
No.

4093
04:34:05,470 --> 04:34:06,550
I'm too scared.

4094
04:34:08,850 --> 04:34:10,010
Above two should be safe.

4095
04:34:10,170 --> 04:34:11,170
How do we know that though?

4096
04:34:20,010 --> 04:34:21,050
We don't.

4097
04:34:23,850 --> 04:34:24,890
We don't.

4098
04:34:25,670 --> 04:34:27,310
From vibes, all vibes.

4099
04:34:28,510 --> 04:34:30,330
Do you think I should just hit in the middle?

4100
04:34:31,730 --> 04:34:32,210
Like that?

4101
04:34:39,130 --> 04:34:40,410
I don't know what to do.

4102
04:34:41,350 --> 04:34:43,650
Honestly, my head is starting to hurt so bad again.

4103
04:34:44,270 --> 04:34:47,130
So I really need to stop thinking.

4104
04:34:51,350 --> 04:34:55,160
I might need you guys to hand hold me all the way through.

4105
04:34:58,270 --> 04:35:05,490
Because I can't take a medicine until I can eat.

4106
04:35:09,770 --> 04:35:11,690
On top of three is bomb.

4107
04:35:13,670 --> 04:35:14,530
Is this true?

4108
04:35:19,020 --> 04:35:20,240
I'll mark it.

4109
04:35:24,390 --> 04:35:24,730
Maybe.

4110
04:35:26,230 --> 04:35:27,470
We don't know.

4111
04:35:28,070 --> 04:35:28,790
It's a guess.

4112
04:35:32,720 --> 04:35:33,420
I'm guessing everything.

4113
04:35:33,540 --> 04:35:36,600
I'm getting so many responses from everybody in the chat.

4114
04:35:36,780 --> 04:35:38,720
I don't know what I want to believe anymore.

4115
04:35:50,690 --> 04:35:52,870
I'm gonna try maybe a cough drop will help.

4116
04:35:54,550 --> 04:35:56,350
I thought my migraine went away.

4117
04:35:56,530 --> 04:35:57,650
Why is it coming back?

4118
04:36:07,700 --> 04:36:08,360
Debs in chat?

4119
04:36:13,260 --> 04:36:15,180
I'm gonna do this one randomly.

4120
04:36:20,020 --> 04:36:21,240
I'm gonna do this one randomly.

4121
04:36:22,100 --> 04:36:22,880
I'm gonna do it.

4122
04:36:23,960 --> 04:36:24,920
I'm gonna do it!

4123
04:36:36,470 --> 04:36:36,950
Crazy.

4124
04:36:40,790 --> 04:36:45,970
Yeah, it doesn't change anything, I think, but...

4125
04:36:45,970 --> 04:36:58,030
Honestly, the probability is better of just like, 1, 2, 3,
4, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

4126
04:36:59,750 --> 04:37:01,110
With seven bombs?

4127
04:37:01,410 --> 04:37:03,070
I mean, the odds are in my favor.

4128
04:37:08,240 --> 04:37:10,220
Top right corner should be safe.

4129
04:37:21,120 --> 04:37:22,900
Which 50-50 spot would be good?

4130
04:37:23,720 --> 04:37:24,300
Like, uh...

4131
04:37:35,710 --> 04:37:37,430
Below three is safe.

4132
04:37:39,030 --> 04:37:40,450
50-50 by the fives.

4133
04:37:40,810 --> 04:37:41,710
What, like, one of these spots?

4134
04:37:43,810 --> 04:37:45,230
We're out a little.

4135
04:37:55,240 --> 04:37:57,740
I love when everybody just answers yes or no.

4136
04:38:00,580 --> 04:38:02,340
And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.

4137
04:38:07,740 --> 04:38:09,820
I'm gonna do below this three.

4138
04:38:14,380 --> 04:38:15,180
Here I go.

4139
04:38:17,380 --> 04:38:18,320
Moment of truth.

4140
04:38:21,600 --> 04:38:22,320
Here I go.

4141
04:38:41,870 --> 04:38:42,350
usable.

4142
04:38:50,350 --> 04:38:51,550
We have one.

4143
04:38:58,840 --> 04:39:01,060
I have 20 minutes.

4144
04:39:04,680 --> 04:39:06,340
Below the other three is safe.

4145
04:39:06,560 --> 04:39:07,100
This one?

4146
04:39:23,860 --> 04:39:25,420
Oh gosh, okay.

4147
04:39:29,630 --> 04:39:30,850
We can logic again.

4148
04:39:31,030 --> 04:39:31,730
Solve the two.

4149
04:39:32,770 --> 04:39:33,170
Boom!

4150
04:39:34,390 --> 04:39:34,770
Boom!

4151
04:39:40,250 --> 04:39:41,270
Uh, I'm...

4152
04:39:41,270 --> 04:39:41,490
Boom!

4153
04:39:47,530 --> 04:39:48,570
Not boom!

4154
04:39:48,910 --> 04:39:49,130
Boom!

4155
04:39:49,530 --> 04:39:49,650
Boom!

4156
04:39:57,190 --> 04:39:58,330
Five left!

4157
04:39:59,070 --> 04:39:59,710
Bam,

4158
04:40:03,390 --> 04:40:04,450
bam, bam, bam.

4159
04:40:06,830 --> 04:40:07,470
Uh...

4160
04:40:07,470 --> 04:40:10,130
Alright, one, two, uh...

4161
04:40:11,350 --> 04:40:12,330
One, two...

4162
04:40:12,330 --> 04:40:13,210
Okay, hold on.

4163
04:40:30,410 --> 04:40:31,130
The three...

4164
04:40:31,130 --> 04:40:32,210
Wait, oh, that's it?

4165
04:40:33,250 --> 04:40:35,150
Guess between the twos?

4166
04:40:35,330 --> 04:40:36,030
Oh, man.

4167
04:40:38,870 --> 04:40:39,510
Ugh...

4168
04:40:42,290 --> 04:40:43,870
Which three am I going below?

4169
04:40:44,710 --> 04:40:46,290
There's two threes that I can go below.

4170
04:40:46,790 --> 04:40:47,310
What are you saying?

4171
04:40:47,670 --> 04:40:48,450
The lower three.

4172
04:40:48,830 --> 04:40:49,350
This one?

4173
04:41:25,840 --> 04:41:28,580
I'd say, though, this was a pretty good...

4174
04:41:29,240 --> 04:41:33,320
Pretty solid attempt for my first time ever playing Mind
Sweeper.

4175
04:41:39,480 --> 04:41:42,460
A lot of people were telling me below this three, though.

4176
04:41:43,480 --> 04:41:43,880
Earlier.

4177
04:41:49,320 --> 04:41:49,600
Shit.

4178
04:41:51,640 --> 04:41:53,520
Okay, I'm going to go hope that this guy...

4179
04:41:53,540 --> 04:41:57,580
goes away before my collab.

4180
04:42:00,140 --> 04:42:04,900
But thank you guys for helping me with Mind Sweet, but maybe
I won't.

4181
04:42:08,760 --> 04:42:11,720
It's not a, it's not a, what's the word?

4182
04:42:12,640 --> 04:42:15,520
Hold on, I'm gonna change the, it's this one.

4183
04:42:17,420 --> 04:42:19,280
Oh, that's so awkward.

4184
04:42:21,520 --> 04:42:22,300
That's fine.

4185
04:42:23,540 --> 04:42:25,360
I just picked a song.

4186
04:42:26,160 --> 04:42:27,560
But it's okay, we party.

4187
04:42:34,980 --> 04:42:39,580
Thank you guys for helping me with my first time ever
playing Mind Sweeper.

4188
04:42:39,920 --> 04:42:42,520
I'm sorry I can't count down with you right now.

4189
04:42:44,200 --> 04:42:46,760
But I will be there for the other countdown, so.

4190
04:42:48,800 --> 04:42:50,520
I'll be there for the next countdown.

4191
04:42:51,200 --> 04:42:52,220
So sorry, EST.

4192
04:42:52,640 --> 04:42:53,300
Just pretend.

4193
04:42:54,460 --> 04:42:55,800
Let's just pretend, okay?

4194
04:42:56,060 --> 04:42:58,080
Get right, go away, clock.

4195
04:42:58,660 --> 04:42:58,960
Go away.

4196
04:43:00,440 --> 04:43:03,900
Three, two, one.

4197
04:43:05,600 --> 04:43:06,980
Happy New Year!

4198
04:43:09,780 --> 04:43:12,960
Just play this right before...

4199
04:43:12,960 --> 04:43:13,980
Wait, no, we're pretending.

4200
04:43:14,140 --> 04:43:15,980
We're a happy New Year!

4201
04:43:21,820 --> 04:43:23,620
Thank you, guys!

4202
04:43:24,100 --> 04:43:32,400
And if you are PST, then we will celebrate that countdown
together, hopefully, if I can stay the whole time.

4203
04:43:35,740 --> 04:43:42,680
Happy New Year, East Coast, happy New Year, Europe.

4204
04:43:43,940 --> 04:43:45,400
That was a while ago, though.

4205
04:43:46,320 --> 04:43:55,760
And I guess Asia has been in it, too, for a while.

4206
04:43:58,180 --> 04:44:06,860
2026 Thank you Thank you thank you Yeah in Australia Yeah
