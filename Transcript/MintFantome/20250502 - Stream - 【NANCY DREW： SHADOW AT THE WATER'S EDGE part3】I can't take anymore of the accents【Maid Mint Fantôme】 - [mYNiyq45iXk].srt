1
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,730
Oh, my God.

2
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,390
Hi, I'm Nancy Drew.

3
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,730
This is my center of operations, my desk.

4
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,290
Go ahead and poke around.

5
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,570
If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do, take a look at the book titled How to Be a Detective.

6
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,830
It's really helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery-solving business.

7
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,150
And be sure to check out my scrapbook.

8
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,690
I put memorabilia from all my past cases in there.

9
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,650
Yapper!

10
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,090
She's just a yapper!

11
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,650
Okay.

12
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh, my God, she's yappin'!

13
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,230
Oh, my God!

14
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:55,630
Oh,

15
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,910
my God!

16
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,730
Look, every time I think she's done.

17
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,810
Wrap it up, Nancy.

18
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,310
Yeah, I have the sign.

19
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,170
I'm holding it up.

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,730
Wrap it up, Nancy.

21
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,910
Nancy would make a good VTuber.

22
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,730
That's what I was thinking.

23
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,110
Hey, we're...

24
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,710
We...

25
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,290
We're out of need for more detective...

26
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,350
VTubers, huh?

27
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,090
We have an opening, so...

28
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,670
Nancy!

29
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,890
Nancy Drew!

30
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:32,990
True!

31
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,810
At least she's not asking us blunt personal questions.

32
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,210
True!

33
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,170
Ah...

34
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,560
Hello, everybody!

35
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,180
Welcome back to Nancy Drew!

36
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,300
Wake up, vlog!

37
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,680
Thank you for letting me get in!

38
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,020
Thank you so much!

39
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,760
Thank you!

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,940
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

41
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,540
Two left us?

42
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,680
Oh!

43
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,640
I forgot about that guy!

44
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:05,760
Hi!

45
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,770
Anyway...

46
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,550
Um...

47
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,790
Hello...

48
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,670
Uh...

49
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,310
Welcome!

50
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,370
Howdy doody!

51
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,330
You good girl?

52
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,190
I'm great!

53
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,510
I'm so good!

54
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,190
I have no context.

55
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,770
You know what?

56
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,750
That's okay.

57
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,250
That's a-okay!

58
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,130
Dark Ray!

59
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,470
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

60
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,630
Thank you!

61
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,430
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

62
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,010
Grass cutting.

63
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,750
I know!

64
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,470
You can hear the lawnmower!

65
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,750
It's like a Sunday morning ASMR...

66
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,330
Is how I feel about this.

67
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,790
Excited to finish Shadow at Water's Edge today?

68
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,470
Yeah!

69
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,270
Chip!

70
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,810
Oh my gosh!

71
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,750
Thank you so much for all your help yesterday.

72
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,730
With the...

73
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,310
With the stuff.

74
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,290
Um...

75
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,730
I'm gonna do my best to...

76
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,770
To game.

77
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,350
To...

78
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,430
To game!

79
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,450
And...

80
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,730
Tensai my way through...

81
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,650
All the puzzles today.

82
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,170
It's your birthday!

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,070
Wait...

84
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,830
Make sure all these years of enjoyment...

85
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,730
I know you can't sing happy birthday, Munstead.

86
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,930
What about saying...

87
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,570
To them, you're a freak...

88
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,310
Like me!

89
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,370
From Dark Knight!

90
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,190
Blue-eyes Thunder Dragon!

91
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:37,890
Happy...

92
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,270
Birthday!

93
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,630
Wait...

94
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,530
How do I say that?

95
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,990
Wait...

96
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,970
Hold on...

97
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,270
Is it like a...

98
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,790
Is it like a...

99
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,810
Is it like...

100
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,090
So it's...

101
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,850
I'm guessing it's the Joker who says it, right?

102
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:47,730
Oh gosh!

103
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,910
It's been a long time since I've seen the Dark Knight.

104
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,550
What if I say like...

105
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:51,870
To them!

106
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,910
You're a freak like me!

107
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,250
Nya!

108
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,930
Ha ha ha ha!

109
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,370
Embracing the freak.

110
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,250
Me!

111
00:06:59,450 --> 00:06:59,850
A...

112
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,690
Real freak!

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,970
What's the...

114
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,810
Heath Ledger impression.

115
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,530
He's like...

116
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:04,590
He's like...

117
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:04,730
Kind of...

118
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,970
He kind of does that like a...

119
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,870
But...

120
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,630
But...

121
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,590
Heath Ledger as the Joker.

122
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,410
He does the...

123
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,450
Like the...

124
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,150
You know, you see...

125
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,130
I'm the Joker.

126
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,090
And...

127
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,850
Uh...

128
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,090
Why so...

129
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,830
Serious?

130
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,390
Ha ha ha ha!

131
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,470
Ha ha ha ha!

132
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,300
Ha ha ha ha!

133
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,920
Is that good?

134
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,040
Was that good?

135
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,900
Is that a good impression?

136
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,840
Probably...

137
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,520
The best ever?

138
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,960
The Joker!

139
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,740
I'm the Joker.

140
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,820
I'm the Joker.

141
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm the...

142
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm the...

143
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,140
I'm the...

144
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,220
I'm the baby.

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,000
Joker?

146
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm the baby.

147
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,380
Joker?

148
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,220
What about...

149
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,540
What if we switch it up a little bit?

150
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,140
What if we become the baby?

151
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,100
The minkler.

152
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,000
Ha ha!

153
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,080
So...

154
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,560
Ah.

155
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,540
Last time...

156
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,400
We were so close to finishing the game.

157
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,220
We made like crazy progress.

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,560
We were going so slow.

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,040
It was like a snail's pace.

160
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,980
And then all of a sudden, boom, bam, boom, bam.

161
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,020
Here's a card key.

162
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,760
Here's a key.

163
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,160
Here's another card key.

164
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,020
Here's a thing.

165
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,240
Boom, here's a password.

166
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,700
Here's a... Here's a collar for your cat and definitely not your girlfriend.

167
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,620
Boom, bam, boom, bam, boom.

168
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,360
And we made so much progress.

169
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,700
My theory is it's Rentaro.

170
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,280
That guy is sussing me out way too much.

171
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,680
I think him and Miwako need to break up.

172
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,860
100%.

173
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,880
They're like... They're like... They're like Jack and Rose, but not as entertaining.

174
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,480
You playing one of my childhood games, Dice.

175
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,260
I hope you play more Nancy Drew.

176
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,320
Maybe.

177
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,600
Maybe in the future.

178
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,040
Super slow, but I realized the same studio that did Oblivion Remastered is doing Delta?

179
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,260
No way.

180
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,680
I promoted to head chef.

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,760
That's awesome.

182
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,600
Congrats.

183
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,500
Is that not... Why is... Double... Workload has doubled.

184
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,200
No.

185
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,660
No.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,780
But... Head chef.

187
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,520
Wow, you must be really good at cooking.

188
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Hope you didn't forget Mito Healthcare Plan installment week too.

189
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,280
No.

190
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,900
Thank you.

191
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,040
I hope she's just as nosy in the other games.

192
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,900
I 100% believe she is.

193
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,160
Nozomu, hello.

194
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,820
Welcome back.

195
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,400
Thank you.

196
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,740
Thank you, thank you.

197
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,000
So, yeah.

198
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,500
Today we're going to finish this up.

199
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,200
Later on, I have a stream with Doki Bird on her channel.

200
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,020
We'll be also finishing Visage.

201
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,800
Do I get to count that in my games that I finished?

202
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,940
For this year?

203
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,940
I technically played it with her from start to finish.

204
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,540
Yes?

205
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
Yeah, hi, hi, hi.

206
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,920
Let's go.

207
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,120
So, let's load...

208
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,060
The game.

209
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,600
Second chance Suki owl.

210
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,120
What is this?

211
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,760
Second chance Suki owl.

212
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,820
That's, I think, when we got killed by Suki.

213
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,260
Which they really need to figure that out.

214
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,680
Definitely should sue.

215
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,480
Sukiyawi.

216
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,000
Nope.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,580
If Doki finishes it.

218
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,600
What do you mean if?

219
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,020
She's got to finish it.

220
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,200
She has to for charity.

221
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,760
I didn't even...

222
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,660
I wasn't even involved in her charity stream.

223
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,240
And somehow I got roped into this.

224
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,180
Okay.

225
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,140
Where were we?

226
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,840
What time is it?

227
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,320
3 a.m.

228
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
Oh boy, 3 a.m.

229
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,580
Okay, Nancy's gonna go to sleep in a couple minutes.

230
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,600
She goes to sleep at 4 a.m.

231
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,660
Where was I?

232
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,520
Let's check our items.

233
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:03,900
Okay.

234
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,740
Oh yes, we...

235
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,800
The cultural room key.

236
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,260
The skeleton key.

237
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,500
The skeleton key opens all doors.

238
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Ending in 8 and 9.

239
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,100
The chest key that opens up the thing in the...

240
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,020
In the cultural room.

241
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,340
We got these numbers for a nonogram.

242
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,300
But we don't know where it goes to yet.

243
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,500
I guess what we can do is...

244
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:44,420
I guess what we can do is check the rooms that end in 8 or 9.

245
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,540
We just done that color block puzzle, right?

246
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, the one right here.

247
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,300
We just did this.

248
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
And it gave us the skeleton key.

249
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,520
Music is getting...

250
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,380
So intense.

251
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,200
Okay.

252
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,740
And then...

253
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,700
Let's go upstairs.

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,360
I don't think we've...

255
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,860
This ends in a 1.

256
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,300
I don't think we investigated...

257
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,940
We've investigated all of these rooms...

258
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,560
But we haven't investigated anything on this side.

259
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,560
So let's check it out.

260
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,020
Okay.

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,640
Alright.

262
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,360
Alright.

263
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,400
Alright.

264
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,900
Okay.

265
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,320
A lot of nothing.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
But we can check it out because we have this magnetic key.

267
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:32,660
Yes.

268
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,120
Good thing nobody else is staying.

269
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,660
It's late.

270
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,040
No!

271
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,960
I should get to bed.

272
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,720
Nancy, no!

273
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,620
We just started.

274
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Did you do the stones?

275
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,740
Yes, I did the stones.

276
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,500
I did the stones.

277
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:53,950
Gosh.

278
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,030
I can't get used to it ever.

279
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,810
Do we have any more homework?

280
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,690
Nope.

281
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,950
We've graded all of these.

282
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,370
Yeah.

283
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,620
Let me call.

284
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,200
Let's call like...

285
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,840
Oh, wait!

286
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,400
We were going to call...

287
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,060
Savannah.

288
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,220
Because we also noticed that she...

289
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,800
Her...

290
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,760
Her...

291
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,680
Name is not at all in the guest list.

292
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,980
Yes!

293
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,660
Spayback, you should make Doki backseat you during an even scarier game.

294
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,920
I would suggest Fatal Frame, but that might thrill her.

295
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,780
I think...

296
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,660
I think...

297
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,760
Honestly...

298
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,400
I...

299
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,440
As scary as I think Fatal Frame is, I wouldn't say it's scarier.

300
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,020
I don't know.

301
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,340
I don't know.

302
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,340
Savannah here.

303
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,820
Savannah here.

304
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,620
Okay.

305
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,320
Alright, here we...

306
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,020
Oh, I just heard, like, the AC turn on in my room.

307
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,420
But, like, in the game.

308
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,140
That's so weird.

309
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,720
I found watery footprints in my room.

310
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,200
Did you see them appear?

311
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,020
Or were they there and you found them?

312
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,580
They were already there.

313
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,520
Well, at least that's good.

314
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,860
Why's that?

315
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,220
To make wet footprints appear, you just need a wet foot and something to put it on.

316
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,740
But when they just start appearing out of the blue...

317
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,120
Oh, yeah.

318
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,320
Ain't nothing too good about that.

319
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,920
Especially considering what happened to the previous innkeeper.

320
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,100
Oh, my God!

321
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,100
What do you mean?

322
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,540
What do you mean?

323
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:19,900
What do you mean?

324
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,180
I know you ain't the superstitious guy.

325
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,160
You know what happened!

326
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,960
Otherwise, you'd be long gone by now.

327
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,540
But it ain't always good to talk about the dead.

328
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,120
Especially those not at rest.

329
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,360
Did you already play Until Dawn now that the movie...

330
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,340
Oh, I have played Until Dawn before.

331
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,820
Actually, Doki and I, we did Man of Medan together.

332
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,020
But, um...

333
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,880
I think the movie is out, though.

334
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,440
I watched someone...

335
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Do a review about the new Until Dawn movie.

336
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,380
And it just is so...

337
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
Even from the trailer, you could tell that they don't follow the game at all.

338
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,580
And it's so...

339
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,500
It's so...

340
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,780
Why?

341
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,940
Why?

342
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,080
Why?

343
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,140
You have, like...

344
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,440
The perfect...

345
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,420
Not perfect...

346
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,200
But you have a plot right there.

347
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,520
Why would you call it Until Dawn?

348
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,300
That's...

349
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,500
Like...

350
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,140
Okay, I get it.

351
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,380
If it's called Until Dawn...

352
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,480
And that's just a coincidence with the game name...

353
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,740
But it's literally supposed to be an adaptation.

354
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,960
Logos, welcome to membership.

355
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,860
Thank you!

356
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,080
Yeah...

357
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,340
I heard it was not great...

358
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,280
But, you know...

359
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,340
It might be good as a standalone by itself movie.

360
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,140
I don't know.

361
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,380
Logan told me you're writing a second ghost hunting book.

362
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,320
Make Donkey play live, right?

363
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,820
Now, that ain't true.

364
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,320
Yeah.

365
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,460
Something happened to make you stop writing the book, didn't it?

366
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,400
Yes.

367
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,560
What happened?

368
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,220
What happened?

369
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,740
Nancy, I like you.

370
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,900
So I ain't ever gonna tell you why.

371
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,780
But I will tell you this.

372
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,960
Don't go looking in dark corners.

373
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,680
Lest you ready to live with knowing what's hiding there.

374
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,540
Okay.

375
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,580
This is...

376
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,400
This is the...

377
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,300
Important thing.

378
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,660
Do you remember what room you stayed in?

379
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,740
We'll keep that for the end.

380
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,560
Ryo!

381
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

382
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,000
Thank you!

383
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,080
See, the thing about Lifeline is...

384
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,260
I don't want to experience it again.

385
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,120
What do you know about EVP?

386
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,780
It's a ghost hunter's best friend.

387
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,260
In more ways than one.

388
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,280
How's that?

389
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,840
Well...

390
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,600
If you're just looking to find evidence that you got a bunch of wild spirits running amok, you'll find it in your EVP recordings.

391
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,180
How do you mean...

392
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh my god, Nancy, stop acting stupid!

393
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,380
It doesn't sound like you think it works.

394
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,880
Oh, you'd be surprised.

395
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,120
The movie The Game and Vice Versa Curse is still strong to this day.

396
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,340
But one thing it doesn't do for such is that you eavesdrop on the whole property without drawing too much attention to yourself.

397
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,260
If something ain't on the level, you'll hear it.

398
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,620
But Nancy...

399
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,200
Yeah?

400
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,180
You might just stumble into something you don't want to hear.

401
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,040
You best be ready for that.

402
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,500
Hmm...

403
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:01,940
Okay.

404
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
How did you get into ghost hunting?

405
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,300
I guess you could say I was born into it.

406
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,680
Oh.

407
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,660
My daddy'd always drag me with him to these spooky old houses, looking for broken down things to fix up.

408
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:11,980
Oh.

409
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,420
I guess that's where I got my start.

410
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,360
Standing in those old falling apart houses.

411
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,680
It was hard not to imagine ghosts coming around in the corner.

412
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,380
Used to scare me something bad, but somewhere along the road, all the fear turned to curiosity.

413
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,320
She's just like Zach Baggins.

414
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,700
When I was a kid, something terrifying happened to me.

415
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,540
I was dragged to houses.

416
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,520
My dad was a realtor.

417
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,300
She sounds like Nico.

418
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,160
Everybody with a country accent sounds like Nico.

419
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,700
Not a realtor.

420
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,740
What is the scariest thing you've seen while ghosts turning?

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,420
What's the scariest?

422
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,020
The really scary things are the ones you'll never see.

423
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,840
What do you mean by that?

424
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,880
But, I guess one of the most frightening places I've been was this little town in the middle of nowhere in Germany.

425
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,280
Oh.

426
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:09,840
Germany.

427
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,940
I was there writing a chapter on an old castle that the locals all said was haunted.

428
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,400
Germany.

429
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,100
Hundreds of years ago, the castle had belonged to this terrible family.

430
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,720
They had a reputation for all sorts of cruelty.

431
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:27,360
At first, I didn't believe the stories, but the more exploring I did, the more I started to see some of the terrible things that had happened now.

432
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,440
She's so vague.

433
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
All those stories, they were true?

434
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,540
Didn't find any ghosts.

435
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,380
That would have been better, I think.

436
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,240
Wait, what do you mean?

437
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,680
Wait.

438
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,160
So she found evidence of them being horrible people?

439
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,420
She strikes me as a liar.

440
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,500
She's like, it's like, ma'am, you're not writing any more ghost books, so just tell me the deets.

441
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,260
It's like she's trying to hold out on me so that she can put it in her book.

442
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm not, I just, I'm just, I'm just nosy Nancy, please.

443
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,580
Okay, just a few more.

444
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,760
Have you run across someone rigging doors to slam before?

445
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,580
Sure.

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Now that one's older than the hills.

447
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,180
What's the best way to do something like that?

448
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
Oh, plenty of ways.

449
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,320
You can use remote control, wire, and pulleys.

450
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,260
We saw that wire.

451
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,140
One place I went even used air pressure.

452
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,640
Air pressure?

453
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Y 'all believe that mess?

454
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,620
Hmm, that makes sense.

455
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,740
What do you mean, I don't believe in air pressure?

456
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,260
What should I keep an eye out for?

457
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,940
Anything that looks out of place.

458
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,100
I don't, she doesn't believe, Savannah doesn't believe in air pressure.

459
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,700
She's telling us so much and nothing at the same time.

460
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,260
I know!

461
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,740
Savannah should go into politics.

462
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,120
Air isn't real.

463
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,460
Air pressure isn't real.

464
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
What does that mean?

465
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,820
Savannah, she's got such a funny way with words.

466
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,760
Okay, here's the important one.

467
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,400
Do you remember what room you stayed in at the Rio Con?

468
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,860
That was so long ago, I don't even have the slightest.

469
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,140
Do you remember anything?

470
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:06,660
Anything!

471
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,540
I remember I was on the second floor.

472
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:08,840
Okay.

473
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,540
And it had this strange passageway in it.

474
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
But that's about it.

475
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,620
Passageway?

476
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,640
I got the impression they weren't too crazy about having me stay there.

477
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,340
So maybe you should check the records for a room that they don't let out to customers.

478
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,960
A passageway to where?

479
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,920
Yeah, it was bizarre.

480
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,240
I don't really remember exactly where it went.

481
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,100
Down into the basement, maybe?

482
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,180
Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to explore the room before I had to leave.

483
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,060
Oh, so it's not that she wasn't on the records.

484
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:43,600
It's that she probably came so long ago that the records didn't go back far enough.

485
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,800
And so now we have to find the room that is not in the records.

486
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,720
Okay, okay, okay.

487
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,040
Can you tell me anything else about your stay here?

488
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Not much to tell, I had to leave too soon.

489
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Such a sweet family.

490
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,460
I hate to think of what those poor girls are going through.

491
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,960
Losing their mother so young and then having them hauntings to deal with.

492
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,600
Bye.

493
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,340
Bye.

494
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,500
Bye-bye, Nancy.

495
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,200
Okay.

496
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,420
Nancy.

497
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,400
Nancy.

498
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,380
Nancy has a heart of steel.

499
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,640
I wonder when we're going to solve this.

500
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,400
Whatever the heck this is.

501
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:31,680
Okay.

502
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,340
So now we have to wait until 1 a.m.

503
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,540
I don't think there was anything else for us.

504
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,120
We can go talk to...

505
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,960
See if they have anything they want to mention.

506
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,020
Like Rental or Miwako or the grandma.

507
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,340
Anything else we can talk to them about.

508
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,700
Hi.

509
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,440
Nope.

510
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,560
I'll talk to you later.

511
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,520
See you later.

512
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,500
Never change, Nancy.

513
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,220
She is so...

514
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,000
She is so Nancy.

515
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,400
Hello, Nancy-san.

516
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,560
Oh, okay.

517
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,040
Do you believe that people have a sense of what's to come?

518
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,960
You probably think I'm silly.

519
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,360
But I do.

520
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,820
Did Kasumi believe this?

521
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,520
Why do you ask?

522
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,280
Was she worried about things before the accident?

523
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,380
I'm sorry.

524
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,100
I must prepare.

525
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,740
I have more lessons.

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
Grandma, there's nobody here except us.

527
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,620
What lessons?

528
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,260
Grandma, it's just me here.

529
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,720
Everybody else is gone.

530
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,100
I've done all your lessons.

531
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,260
Hey.

532
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,460
Okay.

533
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,500
I'll let you get back to work.

534
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,120
Bye.

535
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:41,900
Bye.

536
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay, so we gotta go to our bedroom.

537
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,900
And sleep until 1 a.m.

538
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,960
Okay.

539
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,940
Clock.

540
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,240
We'll give ourselves as much time as possible.

541
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,480
All right.

542
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,020
I love waking up at 1 a.m.

543
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,560
I mean, she does go to sleep at like 7.

544
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,620
So I guess it's not so bad.

545
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,200
I guess it's not so bad.

546
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,140
All right.

547
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,240
I wish that I didn't have to turn this way.

548
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,920
And then like turn around, you know, every time.

549
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,460
All right.

550
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,420
So let's go to the computer.

551
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,300
I think I remember the computer password.

552
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,080
Meow.

553
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,240
Oh, God.

554
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,600
It's glitching out.

555
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,740
Oh, wait.

556
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,180
I don't have to remember the password.

557
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,680
What's the point?

558
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,740
All right, guys.

559
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,020
Let's look for any room that we see is not being rented out.

560
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,100
FNAF cat.

561
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,220
All right.

562
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,200
I see one.

563
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,820
Duargo.

564
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,240
Thank you so much for the 20th.

565
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,420
Thank you.

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,460
I don't see two.

567
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
Or three.

568
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,460
Or four.

569
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,440
I see five.

570
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,770
No six.

571
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,170
There's seven.

572
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,550
And nine.

573
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,630
I should be writing these down, Shadow Nine.

574
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,470
Oh, gosh.

575
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:26,810
Okay.

576
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,250
Hold on.

577
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,490
Hold on.

578
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,870
Hold on.

579
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,510
Hold on.

580
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,710
Hold on.

581
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,270
Uh, note.

582
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,890
Note.

583
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,450
Notepad.

584
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,210
No two, three, four.

585
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,050
Two.

586
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,510
Oops.

587
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,510
Three, four.

588
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,570
Oh, there was five.

589
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,190
I think there was no six, right?

590
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,990
This is so many rooms to check.

591
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,490
Six.

592
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,550
Time to count to 40.

593
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,390
I know.

594
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,170
Uh, we have seven, but there's no eight.

595
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,570
We have nine.

596
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,830
Ten.

597
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,950
Eleven.

598
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,830
Uh, twelve.

599
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,390
Thirteen.

600
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:14,890
Fourteen.

601
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,250
Fifteen.

602
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:15,930
Sixteen.

603
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,510
No.

604
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,070
No seventeen.

605
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,400
Eighteen.

606
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,220
Nineteen.

607
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,620
Twenty.

608
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,550
No, twenty-one.

609
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,970
Twenty-two.

610
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:46,630
Oh, wait.

611
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:46,910
Yes.

612
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,350
Just kidding.

613
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,050
There is twenty-one.

614
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,950
I lied.

615
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,230
I'm a liar.

616
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:50,870
Twenty-two.

617
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,010
Twenty-three.

618
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,670
Twenty-four.

619
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,270
Twenty- Oh, that's thirty-five.

620
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,790
Uh.

621
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,650
I don't see twenty-five.

622
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,230
No twenty-five at Sam's.

623
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,830
Twenty-six.

624
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,810
Twenty-six?

625
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,050
I think I saw twenty-seven as well.

626
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,950
Twenty-seven.

627
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,150
Twenty-eight.

628
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,230
Twenty-eight.

629
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,570
Uh.

630
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,270
Uh... 29.

631
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,230
Sure is a puzzle.

632
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,950
We know how to count.

633
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,850
I don't see 30.

634
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,690
Are there this many?

635
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,410
I have not seen this many rooms.

636
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,830
I'll be honest.

637
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,130
I don't think there's 40 rooms.

638
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
Suck a love.

639
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,480
Uh, 31.

640
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,760
31.

641
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,220
32.

642
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,730
No 33, it seems.

643
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,730
No 33.

644
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,610
33.

645
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,430
34.

646
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,010
34.

647
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,210
34.

648
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:36,550
34.

649
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,410
35.

650
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,050
Oh, 36.

651
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,310
37.

652
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,230
38.

653
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,070
39.

654
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,890
I don't think I saw 40 either.

655
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,150
But I don't even know if there is a room 40.

656
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,410
Genghis, Genghis.

657
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,690
Happy birthday.

658
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,290
Happy, happy birthday.

659
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,150
Thank you so much for the super time.

660
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,530
I don't see 40.

661
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,050
So I'm going to assume there is none.

662
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:14,350
Okay.

663
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,170
Goodbye, Suki.

664
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:17,650
Suki?

665
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:18,990
Wait.

666
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:21,730
Alright.

667
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,370
Let's go to...

668
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,530
Room 2.

669
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,130
I think this... Yes.

670
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:28,610
Alright.

671
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,170
Wait, how do we get... Oh, this is room 3.

672
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,830
Are they on the other side?

673
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,830
There is no room 2.

674
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,470
Oh, it's on the second floor.

675
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,870
You're right.

676
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,290
You're right.

677
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,610
Okay.

678
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,280
So it's not...

679
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,970
2 through 8.

680
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,130
It's got to be...

681
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,790
Uh, 7...

682
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,070
17, I believe, is also on the first floor.

683
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,570
Let me double check.

684
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,590
17, I think, is down here.

686
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

687
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,130
Thank you.

688
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

689
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,590
Good luck with Nancy Drew.

690
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,310
Go see...

691
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,710
Thank you!

692
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:11,950
Locked.

693
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,350
Oh, I don't want it in there anyway.

694
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:13,710
Okay.

695
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,670
So it's not a 17.

696
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,290
25, 30, or 33.

697
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,150
Okay.

698
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,030
25.

699
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,730
I don't think we got to explore any of these.

700
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,030
Okay.

701
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,810
We can go into...

702
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,730
33.

703
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,390
We got to get to the end, though.

704
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,030
I need a key to open this door.

705
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,370
All right, so let's get in here.

706
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,590
Breaking and entering.

707
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,510
And then we turn around.

708
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,890
And we go here.

709
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,630
I should find something that matches that symbol.

710
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,230
Yeah, I know.

711
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,370
Right there, Nancy.

712
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,950
What's that sound?

713
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,080
What's that sound?

714
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,960
I can't do anything!

715
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,840
Ah!

716
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,100
I can't get out!

717
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,460
Uh-oh.

718
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,260
Uh...

719
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,140
It's locked.

720
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,660
Uh-oh.

721
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,500
I can't get out.

722
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,540
Uh-oh.

723
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,040
Am I gonna die?

724
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,760
Uh-oh.

725
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,000
These look like mirror images.

726
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,120
I bet if I could match these up perfectly, I could get out.

727
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:14,960
Oh my god.

728
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,200
Wait, what do you mean by that?

729
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,120
Oh my god!

730
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,100
Oh, okay, okay.

731
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,040
Um...

732
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,580
How fast do I have to be?

733
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,240
Oh my god!

734
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:26,660
Oh my god!

735
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,400
I think we're gonna die!

736
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,180
Oh my god, I think we're gonna die.

737
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,370
Wait.

738
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,250
Huh?

739
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,650
Uh-oh.

740
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,810
Oops, I didn't mean to do that.

741
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,190
Ah!

742
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,470
Wait, why can't I...

743
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,650
Oh my god!

744
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,330
Rip Nancy drill.

745
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,090
She didn't stand a chance.

746
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,530
Wait, how am I supposed to mirror these?

747
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,470
The music actually makes sense for once.

748
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,650
Eek!

749
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,770
Oh my god!

750
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,490
Oh my god!

751
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,350
This is...

752
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,070
This is murder!

753
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,150
This is attempted assassination!

754
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,330
Suddenly, it got so intense.

755
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,880
I'm too...

756
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,480
I'm too frightened to even notice what's going on.

757
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,820
How to do this.

758
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,280
Am I doing this correctly?

759
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,160
How do I make these mirrored, though?

760
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,040
Great content to watch before I sleep.

761
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,320
Don't worry!

762
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,680
We know it's just a...

763
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,760
It's not real ghost.

764
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,280
I'm the only real ghost.

765
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,500
You need...

766
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,720
Oh, this one too.

767
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,860
Was that her opening the door?

768
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,020
Wait, how the heck am I supposed to do these, though?

769
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,900
The sides are flipped.

770
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,040
What do you mean the sides are flipped?

771
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,650
Oh, wait!

772
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,590
Is this supposed to be...

773
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,870
Mirrored this...

774
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,630
Like, up and down?

775
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,550
Or diagonally?

776
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,890
Oh!

777
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,150
Oh!

778
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:29,510
Oh my god!

779
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:29,950
Shh!

780
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:30,630
Oh!

781
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,530
Okay, so I think this is correct.

782
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,650
This all looks the same.

783
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,270
So maybe diagonally.

784
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,250
Okay, okay, hold on.

785
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,130
Yeah!

786
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,890
So we need this...

787
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,950
And then this...

788
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,410
No, we don't.

789
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,670
I can't change this yellow.

790
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,670
I wish I could restart it, so I can know.

791
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,030
Um...

792
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,660
If it's vertically...

793
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,060
Uh...

794
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,560
Can I...

795
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,140
If it's...

796
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,680
I can't go diagonal, because I can't change this...

797
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,500
These two, see?

798
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,180
I can't change these colors.

799
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,780
So it's not diagonal.

800
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,780
I don't think.

801
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,400
Noisy ghost.

802
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,730
I think it's gotta be up and down.

803
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,990
Oh, oops.

804
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,210
Yeah.

805
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,030
Oh, oh.

806
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,330
It keeps sounding like she's opening the door.

807
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,530
Ooh!

808
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,080
Oh yeah, see?

809
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,500
I can't change any of...

810
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,020
What?

811
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,780
Wait, so it's not these two.

812
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,480
It's not diagonal.

813
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,040
What else could it be mirrored?

814
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,780
You gotta purple wear a blue should be.

815
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,840
Which one, though?

816
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,680
Unless it's...

817
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,140
Wait.

818
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:08,980
Like that?

819
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,500
Uh, and blue here?

820
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,500
But then, this one still doesn't make sense.

821
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:14,960
If...

822
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,080
Ugh.

823
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,220
But I'm still confused, because...

824
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,370
I'm still confused.

825
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,590
I'm still very confused.

826
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,430
I wish I could...

827
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:40,950
Okay, hold on.

828
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,870
I can't get rid of that.

829
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,130
So we gotta put that here.

830
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,350
Do I have to fill in every piece?

831
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,490
No way.

832
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:50,710
Okay.

833
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,250
This is purple.

834
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,580
Um...

835
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,400
Three and...

836
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:09,980
Oh!

837
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,560
Oh my god!

838
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,980
I actually died!

839
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,500
The good news, gravity still works.

840
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,560
The bad news, people won't stop putting stuff above that door.

841
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,360
Is that what it said?

842
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,500
Oh my god!

843
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,580
I actually...

844
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,880
These look like mirror images.

845
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,000
I bet if I could match these up perfectly, I could get out.

846
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,360
Okay.

847
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:32,840
Alright.

848
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,640
Here we go.

849
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:35,860
Wait.

850
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,920
Uh, yes.

851
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,480
Okay.

852
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,620
So here we go!

853
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,440
This is...

854
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,160
This will be a little bit easier if I can already tell what is...

855
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,460
What is here.

856
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,100
You know what I mean?

857
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,860
And then red on this side.

858
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,980
Okay.

859
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,000
And then green.

860
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,400
Here.

861
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,340
Wait.

862
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,720
Oh wait.

863
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,760
If it's mirrored...

864
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,320
Oh my gosh.

865
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,100
Oh, this is so confusing.

866
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,680
This is so...

867
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,040
My brain hurts.

868
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,800
So it's gotta be red on...

869
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,020
This side.

870
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,000
Right there.

871
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,920
And then little...

872
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,860
And then blue in the middle.

873
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,360
And then a little blue...

874
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,180
On this side.

875
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,740
Ooh!

876
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,480
I can't give you a lot of time, but also...

877
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,780
I feel no time.

878
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,220
Okay.

879
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,520
Alright.

880
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,280
Blue, blue.

881
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,480
This, this.

882
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,260
Um...

883
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,200
Yellow on this side.

884
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,480
Green on this side.

885
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,400
Yellow...

886
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,480
On...

887
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,580
Uh...

888
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,480
This...

889
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Side, right?

890
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,500
And then...

891
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,240
Like that.

892
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
And then green.

893
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,020
And then blue.

894
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,780
Oh my gosh.

895
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,280
It always sounds like she's going...

896
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,640
Getting in.

897
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,700
And then like that.

898
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,040
Okay.

899
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,060
Now just these two.

900
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:51,980
Okay.

901
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,800
Uh...

902
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Wait.

903
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,360
Okay.

904
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,120
Red, red.

905
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,560
Um...

906
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,220
Purple here.

907
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,160
Yeah.

908
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,740
Uh...

909
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,720
Red on this side.

910
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,200
And then...

911
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,640
Uh...

912
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,280
Purple...

913
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,860
Oh gosh.

914
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,360
Here.

915
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,380
And purple...

916
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:21,600
Here.

917
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,120
Is that everything?

918
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,560
What am I missing?

919
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,220
Missing a red.

920
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,560
Where at?

921
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,320
You're missing a little red.

922
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,020
I am?

923
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,720
Oh gosh.

924
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,440
Wait.

925
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,040
Is it this one?

926
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,680
Ah.

927
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,720
Oh.

928
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:46,980
No.

929
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,800
I messed it up.

930
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,520
Uh...

931
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:50,980
No.

932
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,220
I didn't mess it up.

933
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,840
I...

934
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,260
Wait.

935
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:53,840
Uh...

936
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,040
No.

937
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,460
I didn't mess it up.

938
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,040
I'm just kidding.

939
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,460
Uh...

940
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,680
Uh...

941
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,980
Below purple top right.

942
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,280
Yeah.

943
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:04,900
I got that.

944
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,220
Uh...

945
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,380
Liz, I can't read your...

946
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,700
I'm sorry.

947
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
I can't read your super chat right now.

948
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,080
Just because this is timed.

949
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,860
But thank you so much.

950
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:17,780
Um...

951
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,560
What am I missing?

952
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,860
You gotta fill in the whole thing.

953
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,460
Wait.

954
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:24,740
What?

955
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,550
What?

956
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,810
How is that...

957
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,150
Possible?

958
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:32,970
What?

959
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,730
I just put in my own random colors?

960
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:36,930
Huh?

961
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,560
Fill it in mirrored.

962
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,730
The goal is unclear.

963
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:52,450
Wait.

964
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,650
Yeah.

965
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,530
I'm so confused.

966
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,230
Every slice needs to look the same.

967
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:57,590
What?

968
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,170
What?

969
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:58,990
Huh?

970
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,630
Every...

971
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,870
That's not possi...

972
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,530
What?

973
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,350
All the pies have to look the same?

974
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:12,750
Oh...

975
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,570
No...

976
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,450
Way.

977
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,550
Oh my god.

978
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,730
Are you kidding me?

979
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,090
Oh my god.

980
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,790
Are you kidding me?

981
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,170
For real?

982
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:22,530
Oh.

983
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:22,710
Oh.

984
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:22,970
Shoot.

985
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,610
No way.

986
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,750
No way.

987
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,050
Oh my god.

988
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,170
Oh my god.

989
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,290
That's insane.

990
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,830
Do we even have time for that?

991
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,730
I feel like I'm going to need to screenshot.

992
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,690
How this is supposed to look?

993
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,750
Oh, I even...

994
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,810
Have time.

995
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,690
Okay, like that.

996
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,730
Let's just do what all this...

997
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,310
Wait.

998
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,170
Eh?

999
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,310
Eh?

1000
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,070
Eh?

1001
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,650
Ah, blue.

1002
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,090
Blue.

1003
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:57,770
Oh, what?

1004
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,350
Eh?

1005
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,410
Oh gosh.

1006
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,310
I'm messing it up.

1007
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:00,710
Ah!

1008
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,750
Wait, this is so evil.

1009
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,090
Oh my god.

1010
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,190
Okay.

1011
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:17,790
Okay.

1012
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:18,470
Okay.

1013
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,350
And then...

1014
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,050
Purp...

1015
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,350
Oh.

1016
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:22,770
Purple.

1017
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,370
I thought I was about to die.

1018
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,690
Green.

1019
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,370
I'm doing like all the really easy ones.

1020
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,350
The like, you know, middle ones first.

1021
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,310
You know, the ones that...

1022
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:32,630
Ah!

1023
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,430
No!

1024
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,310
Oh!

1025
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,550
Don't rush.

1026
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,510
We have to!

1027
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,470
What the hell?

1028
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,000
Scientists say that a blow to the head may inspire moments of clarity and also a sense of deja vu.

1029
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:53,960
Scientists...

1030
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,300
There's different...

1031
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,260
There's different...

1032
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,500
Death...

1033
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,800
These look like mirror images.

1034
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,000
I bet if I could match these up perfectly, I could get out.

1035
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,880
Okay.

1036
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,480
Okay.

1037
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,020
Okay.

1038
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,660
Okay.

1039
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,260
Okay.

1040
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,520
Okay.

1041
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:06,780
Okay.

1042
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:06,820
Okay.

1043
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,340
I'm gonna start like by filling in the middles.

1044
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,460
Kind of with what we know.

1045
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,600
You know?

1046
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,680
So it's like this.

1047
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,280
This.

1048
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,820
This.

1049
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,680
This.

1050
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,280
This.

1051
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,780
And then red is on the other side.

1052
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,140
Like that.

1053
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:27,520
Okay.

1054
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:27,760
Okay.

1055
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:27,940
Okay.

1056
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,120
Um...

1057
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,900
And it's diagonal.

1058
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,580
So like that.

1059
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,540
How am I supposed to know the other middle colors though?

1060
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:36,960
Okay.

1061
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,040
I'm just...

1062
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:40,960
Okay.

1063
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:46,810
Wait.

1064
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,390
Nope.

1065
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,640
I know it might be wiser to do one color at a time.

1066
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,220
But I don't know.

1067
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,740
Center is all red?

1068
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,700
Like that?

1069
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,260
Why are they all not red?

1070
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,280
I don't know.

1071
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,200
I don't know.

1072
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,200
I don't know.

1073
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,500
Okay.

1074
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,020
These ones are gonna be the hardest for me.

1075
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,360
So this is like this.

1076
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,430
Oh, it's so confusing for me.

1077
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:36,970
Wait.

1078
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:37,490
No.

1079
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,210
No?

1080
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,130
I don't know.

1081
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:40,870
Yeah, I don't know.

1082
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,550
I redo.

1083
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,130
I redo.

1084
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,870
Okay, hold on.

1085
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,770
Ah!

1086
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,470
Too much pressure!

1087
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,190
Too much pressure!

1088
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,430
Oh my gosh.

1089
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,630
This is making my head hurt.

1090
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,050
Because it's so like...

1091
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,950
I have to do the opposite side.

1092
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:55,250
Okay.

1093
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,010
So it's the right.

1094
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:56,970
And then the green.

1095
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:57,870
Okay.

1096
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,650
Alright.

1097
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:58,990
Okay.

1098
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,310
Okay.

1099
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:04,690
Okay.

1100
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:05,530
Green.

1101
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,730
Green.

1102
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,570
Green.

1103
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,610
Okay.

1104
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,710
What was in the other corner?

1105
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,290
Red.

1106
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,630
Okay.

1107
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:28,630
Okay.

1108
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,410
Oh.

1109
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,410
Oops.

1110
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,530
That's purple.

1111
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:41,810
Purple.

1112
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,390
Purple.

1113
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,010
Blue.

1114
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,130
Uh.

1115
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,050
Blue.

1116
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,090
Oh.

1117
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:50,730
Blue.

1118
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:52,750
Blue.

1119
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,550
Purple, purple.

1120
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,630
Ah!

1121
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:55,530
We're so close!

1122
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,290
We're so close!

1123
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,970
Okay, um... Okay.

1124
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,170
Uh, the tiny... It's the tiny ones that really screw me up.

1125
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,430
Okay, like this.

1126
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,390
So it's on the left side.

1127
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,750
And then red is on the other one.

1128
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:08,050
Okay.

1129
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,050
Yes.

1130
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,890
Then red.

1131
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:15,650
Yes.

1132
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:16,010
Okay.

1133
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,690
We got this.

1134
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:18,090
Okay.

1135
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:18,710
Nice.

1136
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,390
Okay.

1137
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,710
Uh, which...

1138
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,950
triangle is that one?

1139
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,010
I can't find it.

1140
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,170
But we have green triangle here.

1141
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,470
So on the right side?

1142
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,030
Right.

1143
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,190
Right.

1144
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,090
Right.

1145
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:32,670
Right.

1146
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,670
Where's the... Where's this triangle?

1147
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,090
I can't find it.

1148
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,190
Ah!

1149
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:38,630
I can't find it.

1150
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,310
I can't find it!

1151
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:47,970
Is it also... Is it also... Eee!

1152
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,050
It's all green?

1153
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,950
The tiny ones.

1154
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,270
I can't find that.

1155
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:57,670
Oh gosh.

1156
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,690
Now that I'm like, we're filling it in so much.

1157
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,450
I can't tell.

1158
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:02,190
Okay.

1159
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:02,730
Purple.

1160
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,090
Purple.

1161
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:04,590
Purple.

1162
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:05,970
Blue.

1163
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:07,770
Blue.

1164
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:11,190
Purple.

1165
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:11,730
Please.

1166
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:12,150
Please.

1167
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,610
Just give me a little more time Gabe.

1168
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:14,450
Please.

1169
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:15,970
I'm so close.

1170
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,410
Please Gabe.

1171
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,470
I'm so close.

1172
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,190
Purple.

1173
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,550
On this side.

1174
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:23,210
Wait.

1175
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:23,650
Purple.

1176
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,750
Oh my gosh.

1177
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,190
I can't find the other little triangle.

1178
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:27,970
Oh wait.

1179
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:28,990
Which one am I filling in?

1180
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,070
This one next to green.

1181
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:32,350
Okay.

1182
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,810
It's red.

1183
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:33,290
Okay.

1184
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:33,650
It's red.

1185
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,470
Okay.

1186
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:35,850
Please.

1187
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,310
Just Gabe.

1188
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:36,710
Please.

1189
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,530
Just a little bit of time.

1190
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,070
Just a little bit of time.

1191
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:39,370
Please.

1192
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:40,130
Purple.

1193
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,110
Purple.

1194
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,170
Purple.

1195
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:42,970
Purple.

1196
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,390
Red.

1197
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,010
Red.

1198
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,070
Red.

1199
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,040
Save.

1200
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,120
The game.

1201
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,350
Okay.

1202
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,730
Hold on.

1203
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:03,970
Now I'm going to look at it.

1204
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,630
So it's purple.

1205
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,230
Wait.

1206
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:06,450
It's.

1207
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:07,270
Yeah.

1208
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,770
Purple.

1209
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:08,150
Green.

1210
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,190
Okay.

1211
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:09,470
Hold on.

1212
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,990
Purple.

1213
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:12,870
Um.

1214
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:13,650
See.

1215
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,890
This one really confuses me.

1216
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:15,530
I don't know why.

1217
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,570
I don't know why this one confuses me so much.

1218
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:20,470
Wait.

1219
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:20,790
That.

1220
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:21,950
That doesn't seem right.

1221
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,230
No.

1222
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:22,850
Oh.

1223
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,330
It's the opposite.

1224
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:23,830
I'm stupid.

1225
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:24,450
Why am I.

1226
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,270
Why am I so stupid?

1227
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:25,650
Sorry.

1228
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,550
I'm just gonna go.

1229
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,130
No.

1230
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:37,870
No.

1231
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:38,630
No.

1232
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:38,990
No.

1233
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:39,670
No.

1234
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:39,730
No.

1235
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:39,770
No.

1236
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:39,870
No.

1237
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,250
Wait.

1238
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,090
Did I just save the game?

1239
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:41,990
No.

1240
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:42,690
Load.

1241
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,570
Load.

1242
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,500
I saved the game.

1243
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,470
These look like mirror images.

1244
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,610
I bet if I could match these up perfectly, I could get out.

1245
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,530
Guys.

1246
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,490
I'm sorry.

1247
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,250
I'm so sorry.

1248
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,650
I'm so sorry.

1249
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,590
I'm so sorry.

1250
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:22,490
Okay.

1251
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,990
Wait, I, oh, uh, wait.

1252
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:44,730
Oh, I forgot this one.

1253
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,150
Does that look right?

1254
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,450
Wait, does that look right?

1255
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,030
Did I mess this one up?

1256
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,140
Yeah?

1257
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,620
Oh, yeah, because it's opposite.

1258
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,260
Okay, okay, okay.

1259
00:47:59,640 --> 00:47:59,940
Blue.

1260
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,920
I can't believe.

1261
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,560
I can't believe.

1262
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,320
I mean, I can believe.

1263
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,080
I can believe, actually.

1264
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,600
You know.

1265
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,160
Okay, gosh.

1266
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,340
Oh, gosh.

1267
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:15,840
Okay.

1268
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,940
Okay.

1269
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,400
Ah.

1270
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:18,620
Yellow.

1271
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,240
Yellow.

1272
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,200
Yellow.

1273
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:21,780
Yellow.

1274
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,640
Yellow.

1275
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,360
This is, yeah, this is the pizza pie.

1276
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,380
We got the pizza.

1277
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,000
Oh, nope, nope.

1278
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,440
We got the pizza pie.

1279
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,000
Pizza pie, pizza pie, pizza pie, pizza pie.

1280
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,660
They're opposites.

1281
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,240
They're opposites.

1282
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:38,680
They're opposites.

1283
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,140
Okay.

1284
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,240
Okay.

1285
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:41,700
Alright.

1286
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,720
This little triangle is... What are you?

1287
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,240
I can't even see it.

1288
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,440
Okay, hold on.

1289
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:49,820
Purple.

1290
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,860
Wait, is that the right one?

1291
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,300
No.

1292
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,340
I didn't even fill in the right one.

1293
00:48:59,560 --> 00:48:59,600
Okay.

1294
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:00,920
Okay.

1295
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,500
Okay.

1296
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,300
Pizza pie, pizza pie, pizza pie.

1297
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,360
Purple, purple.

1298
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,320
What's the other one, though?

1299
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,120
Red.

1300
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:14,840
Okay.

1301
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,500
So this is purple.

1302
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,540
And purple.

1303
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,220
And red.

1304
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:27,320
I like how it sounds like it's opening up, but it's just not even... Okay.

1305
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,740
And then red.

1306
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,280
Red.

1307
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,520
Red.

1308
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,220
Red.

1309
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Red.

1310
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,960
Purple, purple.

1311
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,320
It's just... It's not even... She's not even the thing that kills me.

1312
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,660
Red.

1313
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,520
Red.

1314
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,620
Red.

1315
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:45,880
Red.

1316
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:46,920
Red.

1317
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,240
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

1318
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:53,680
Okay.

1319
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,460
Alright.

1320
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,140
We're getting the tiny pieces out of the way.

1321
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:03,000
We're getting all these teeny tiny, itsy-bitsy, yellow polka dot bikini pieces out of the way.

1322
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,360
Um... And yellow.

1323
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,240
Okay.

1324
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,140
So it's...

1325
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,660
Purple.

1326
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,740
Purple.

1327
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,400
Purple.

1328
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,240
Purple.

1329
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:15,700
Purple.

1330
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,120
Purple.

1331
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:16,960
Purple.

1332
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,420
Yellow.

1333
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,360
Yellow.

1334
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,060
Yellow.

1335
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:19,820
Yellow.

1336
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:20,620
Yellow.

1337
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Yellow.

1338
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,480
Is that opposite?

1339
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,040
Yes, it is.

1340
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,460
Red.

1341
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,560
And then red on this side.

1342
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,080
Red.

1343
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:25,780
Red.

1344
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,660
Red.

1345
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:27,500
Red.

1346
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,000
Red.

1347
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,100
Red.

1348
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:29,420
Red.

1349
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:29,460
Red.

1350
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:29,840
Green.

1351
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:30,960
Green.

1352
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:31,620
Green.

1353
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,500
Green.

1354
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:32,880
Green.

1355
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:33,240
Green.

1356
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,280
Green.

1357
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,860
What's the middle?

1358
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:34,280
Okay.

1359
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:34,900
Blue.

1360
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,200
Oh my gosh.

1361
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,340
She sounds so close, though.

1362
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,280
Okay.

1363
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,320
Alright.

1364
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,740
Blue.

1365
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,320
Blue.

1366
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,220
Blue.

1367
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:46,860
Blue.

1368
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,500
Blue.

1369
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,070
Okay.

1370
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,910
I'm saving again, once again.

1371
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,330
I love watching your VODs have a nice day.

1372
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:58,890
Thank you.

1373
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,750
Thank you so much.

1374
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:03,590
Purple.

1375
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,610
Purple.

1376
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:06,470
Purple.

1377
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,130
Purple.

1378
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:09,390
Purple.

1379
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,310
Oh, oh, uh, purple.

1380
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,550
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

1381
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,370
Alright, just the triangles left.

1382
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:18,810
Okay.

1383
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:20,410
Oh.

1384
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,350
Where?

1385
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:22,890
Oh, green.

1386
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,210
Oh, these are all green, right?

1387
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,730
I'm getting out of here, now.

1388
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,030
Just in case.

1389
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,550
Oh, oh my gosh, we hopped the fence.

1390
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,790
Um...

1391
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,250
It's 2 a.m.

1392
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,390
Do we go back?

1393
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,000
Well...

1394
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,140
Do we... Do we go back?

1395
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,680
I'm going back.

1396
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,730
Excuse me.

1397
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,510
I should find something that matches that symbol.

1398
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:20,850
Yeah.

1399
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,740
Okay, hold on.

1400
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,680
It's this room.

1401
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,180
This is the one that, um...

1402
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,180
Uh, it's no...

1403
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:35,660
No?

1404
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,620
No?

1405
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,340
No, no tunnel?

1406
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,460
Was it this one?

1407
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,640
No?

1408
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,420
No?

1409
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,920
None of these have a tunnel.

1410
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:50,940
None of these have a tunnel.

1411
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,720
The detective is persistent.

1412
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,060
Thank you.

1413
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,400
Uh...

1414
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,480
Tunnel was on the second floor.

1415
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,680
I went up on the second floor.

1416
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,140
I'm on the second floor.

1417
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:08,400
See?

1418
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,640
It was like a...

1419
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,000
Um...

1420
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,600
So we...

1421
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,400
Figured that maybe it was room 30...

1422
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,900
Three.

1423
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,260
Which was this...

1424
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,440
Oh.

1425
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,280
Wait.

1426
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,880
Which was this one.

1427
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,400
Which I just went in.

1428
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,160
Hmm...

1429
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,440
Kirby was something I made up.

1430
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:31,860
Oh.

1431
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,240
I think I remember you saying that there was like a Kirby live action.

1432
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,380
Green bear.

1433
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,300
Call Savannah.

1434
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,140
At 3am?

1435
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:43,580
Okay.

1436
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,820
It's a little late.

1437
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,080
I should call tomorrow.

1438
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:47,800
Dang it.

1439
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,320
Nancy, that's where you draw the line?

1440
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,380
Okay, hold on.

1441
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,160
But there was also...

1442
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,940
25 it could have been.

1443
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:54,800
Let's go to 25.

1444
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,530
Okay, so it's the third door down.

1445
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,150
Alright.

1446
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,490
Third door down.

1447
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,050
Gosh.

1448
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,990
They really need like a security or something.

1449
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:13,610
At this...

1450
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:14,750
At this video, guys.

1451
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,270
We're just wandering around doing whatever we want.

1452
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,130
Just Nancy drewing it up.

1453
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,310
The whole place.

1454
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:21,770
What?

1455
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,430
There's no secret passage here either.

1456
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,200
Hmm.

1457
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,380
Hmm.

1458
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,100
Are we gonna have to do that puzzle again in our own room?

1459
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,190
Because I'm pretty sure our room has the, uh...

1460
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,080
Yeah, look.

1461
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:52,980
It has it.

1462
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:53,740
Oh no!

1463
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,920
Am I gonna have to do it again?

1464
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,540
Hmm...

1465
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:02,120
It's definitely not our room that has the secret tunnel.

1466
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,040
I guess we wait until morning.

1467
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,020
I guess we wait until morning.

1468
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,300
I guess we wait until morning.

1469
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,180
Still, I don't know where to find the nonograms at.

1470
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,840
Let's sleep.

1471
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,860
Until 7pm.

1472
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,640
I think it is room 33, but we need a hint or something.

1473
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,340
I don't know.

1474
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,100
I feel like the only thing we can do to get a hint is call people.

1475
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,420
Or talk to people.

1476
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,140
Alright.

1477
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,360
Nancy, go to sleep.

1478
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,500
Okay.

1479
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,180
Where's my bed?

1480
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,050
Okay.

1481
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:00,870
How did it get so late already?

1482
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,290
I should get to bed.

1483
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,050
I should get to bed.

1484
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:06,830
Alright.

1485
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:08,910
We teach.

1486
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,490
By day, we are a teacher.

1487
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,670
And by night, we are the nosiest person to exist.

1488
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,230
You chose PM.

1489
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:19,130
Yes.

1490
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,870
We have to.

1491
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,150
We have to.

1492
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,630
We can't wake up at 7am.

1493
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,910
Nancy will say that...

1494
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,390
That...

1495
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,770
She will be busy.

1496
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,310
It's literally part of the game.

1497
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:35,790
Hi.

1498
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,130
Hi.

1499
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,770
I'll let you get back to work.

1500
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,950
See you later.

1501
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:48,950
Hello.

1502
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:49,870
Oh my god.

1503
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,410
I should go.

1504
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:52,530
I'll talk to you later.

1505
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:53,650
Peace out.

1506
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,710
Peace out.

1507
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,130
Peace, peace.

1508
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:57,690
I don't think we...

1509
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,730
Okay, let's call...

1510
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:01,570
Phone...

1511
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:02,630
Savannah.

1512
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:04,670
What?

1513
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,890
Ducted by aliens.

1514
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,550
Turns out it was a mothership.

1515
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,950
Can you think of anything else about the room you stayed in when you were here?

1516
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:15,390
Yeah, yeah.

1517
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,330
Not really.

1518
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:17,590
I'm so Nancy.

1519
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,370
Wait a minute now.

1520
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,330
Come to think of it.

1521
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,970
It had a carved wooden bud that triggered the patch.

1522
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,330
I hope that helped.

1523
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,290
Oh, okay.

1524
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,330
That does actually.

1525
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,270
I better get going.

1526
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,190
Bye bye, Nancy.

1527
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:30,390
Bye bye.

1528
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:31,110
Bye bye.

1529
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:31,730
Okay.

1530
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,470
Let's go back.

1531
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,630
A wooden bird that triggered it.

1532
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,570
Did you guys see a wooden bird anywhere?

1533
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:46,970
Let's see a wooden bird.

1534
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,810
A wooden...

1535
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,670
Oh my god.

1536
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,710
I was gonna say if it's freaking Yumi sending me more things.

1537
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,070
Thank you, Yumi.

1538
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:02,530
Okay.

1539
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,730
Yumi, we almost...

1540
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:05,950
We actually just died.

1541
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:06,850
But, you know.

1542
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,390
Keep sending your cute little purikura.

1543
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,640
What room are we in?

1544
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,100
Wooden bird.

1545
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:17,900
Maybe one more?

1546
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:22,800
Wooden...

1547
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,460
Oh.

1548
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,540
The wooden bird!

1549
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,460
Oh.

1550
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,140
Uh.

1551
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,860
She cut out.

1552
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,820
Nancy, what were you saying?

1553
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,460
Oh my god.

1554
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,060
Nancy, get a flashlight.

1555
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,000
Nancy, I'm scared.

1556
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,040
Nancy, hold my hand!

1557
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,660
Oh my god.

1558
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,840
Oh my god!

1559
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,460
This was me where she died!

1560
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:49,980
Yes!

1561
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,960
They did seal it off.

1562
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,780
Looks like they really wanted to keep people out of here.

1563
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,240
I wonder why.

1564
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,000
Oh, Nancy!

1565
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,100
Oh, Nancy!

1566
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:58,540
Oh, Nancy!

1567
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:58,760
Come on!

1568
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,160
Can you not use your big brain for one second?

1569
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,860
Come on!

1570
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,120
Girl!

1571
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,500
Bento!

1572
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,500
Em, stop it or you'll be sorry.

1573
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,040
Miwakl!

1574
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,220
Stop it or you'll be sorry from Yumi!

1575
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:20,840
Okay.

1576
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,700
The girls are fighting.

1577
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,680
The girls are fighting.

1578
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,700
Look, they even have their...

1579
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,700
The nonogram!

1580
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,180
They even have like a little shrine set up to mom.

1581
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,560
You guys have that in your house for me too, right?

1582
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,900
Whoa!

1583
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,040
What is going on with the water?

1584
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,360
Uh...

1585
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,380
Should we solve the puzzle first or...

1586
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:46,680
No!

1587
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,810
I definitely don't want to go in there.

1588
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,430
Someone peed in the water.

1589
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,230
I mean, yeah.

1590
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,290
It looks ancient.

1591
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,670
Looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years.

1592
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:03,350
Okay.

1593
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:06,390
It looks like I need another set of numbers.

1594
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:07,590
Oh no!

1595
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:08,750
Where?

1596
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,190
No way!

1597
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,530
Oh no!

1598
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,410
I didn't even think about that.

1599
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:18,670
Okay.

1600
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,630
Well, let me out.

1601
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:20,950
Oh my gosh!

1602
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:21,450
Where?

1603
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,480
Where could we get the other set?

1604
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,180
Um...

1605
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,500
Uh...

1606
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,640
Anything here?

1607
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,940
It's so creepy in here.

1608
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,900
Where could we get the other set?

1609
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,780
Is my question.

1610
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,300
Because...

1611
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,860
I don't know where else to go.

1612
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:49,720
Actually.

1613
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,620
I don't like the looks of that pool.

1614
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,340
What is it?

1615
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,040
Swimming pool?

1616
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,220
In the dookie water?

1617
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,520
Um...

1618
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,280
This is like the...

1619
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,980
This is like the...

1620
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,040
This is like the...

1621
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,760
The mummy sarcophagus juice.

1622
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,380
Where could the other half be?

1623
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,720
I don't know where I haven't searched.

1624
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:24,510
Oh my gosh.

1625
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,070
Thank you so much again for the summertime!

1626
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,070
I'm picturing something.

1627
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,510
Nancy drew me an actual ghost.

1628
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,770
And she is mint phantom.

1629
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:32,730
And she is the ghost.

1630
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,930
The spirit that the detective's assistant.

1631
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:35,510
Telling Nancy.

1632
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,450
Use your brain for once.

1633
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:37,750
Yeah.

1634
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:38,890
I can picture that too.

1635
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,010
Time to chat up some people.

1636
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:44,770
I guess so.

1637
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,110
I'm surprised we can't look at the...

1638
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,530
The shrine right there.

1639
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:53,310
I guess Nancy does have a little bit of decency.

1640
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,110
Oh wait.

1641
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,370
I don't know why I thought that I have to leave the way I came in.

1642
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,070
But...

1643
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:02,430
I guess to be less suspicious.

1644
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,630
I wonder if they're ever just like...

1645
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,290
Why is Nancy roaming the...

1646
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,150
The ryokan?

1647
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,230
Like...

1648
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,050
What is she...

1649
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,410
What is she trying to get?

1650
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:10,930
You know?

1651
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,810
Let's see if Miwako has anything to say.

1652
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:18,410
Hello.

1653
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:19,030
Nope.

1654
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,790
I should go.

1655
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,990
I'll talk to you later.

1656
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,470
See you later.

1657
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,530
Thank you Dr. Avocado.

1658
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:23,610
Thank you.

1659
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:24,530
Alright, let's talk.

1660
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:27,170
Maybe Yumi has something to say.

1661
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,630
We haven't been to her place either in a bit, so...

1662
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,730
I like how they left towels and shower stuff.

1663
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:36,290
I know.

1664
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:37,510
Oh.

1665
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:38,030
Hello.

1666
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:39,530
Not in.

1667
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,620
Hello.

1668
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,340
Not in.

1669
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,880
Let's try...

1670
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,440
George.

1671
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:55,760
Hello.

1672
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,960
I got a great picture of...

1673
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,340
From you...

1674
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,740
Of you from Yumi, Bess.

1675
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,500
I got a great picture of you from Yumi, Bess.

1676
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,300
I got a great picture of you from Yumi, Bess.

1677
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,800
Yumi really seems to love those machines.

1678
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,660
I wonder why she keeps sending me these pictures.

1679
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:11,760
I don't know.

1680
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,840
Maybe it's just her way of being friendly?

1681
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:15,700
Oh.

1682
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:16,860
Okay.

1683
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,580
I'll let you get back to work.

1684
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,560
Talk to you later.

1685
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,760
Bye bye.

1686
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,320
Bye bye.

1687
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,320
Not in.

1688
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,760
Bye bye.

1689
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:28,580
Alright.

1690
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,660
She is in...

1691
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,140
Matsue.

1692
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,780
I feel like if there's a clue in the photos...

1693
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,950
It's like these...

1694
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:55,350
It's like the...

1695
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,050
The kanji.

1696
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:56,570
You know?

1697
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:57,870
Cause she keeps sending...

1698
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,110
It says like, you know...

1699
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,470
It's the numbers.

1700
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,350
The numbers!

1701
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:04,370
This looks like cut off five.

1702
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,630
Maybe this isn't Roppongi after all.

1703
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:10,170
I don't know.

1704
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,170
I feel like it's gotta be the numbers.

1705
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,050
The numbers!

1706
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:18,230
Hello!

1707
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,990
Great picture of Bess.

1708
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,690
Yeah.

1709
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:23,810
I love that one.

1710
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,350
That's it?

1711
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,250
I'm ready to help with more Bento.

1712
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:30,030
Okay.

1713
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,750
We're doing...

1714
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,150
Oh, wait.

1715
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:31,630
Oh!

1716
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:32,630
This one's not so bad.

1717
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,390
Look, we have...

1718
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:33,910
Already have...

1719
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:34,710
We have a cross.

1720
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:37,470
Maybe.

1721
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:38,730
It's not so bad.

1722
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:42,750
Uh...

1723
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:44,470
Uh...

1724
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:45,130
Okay.

1725
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,750
So this middle one's gotta be a rabbit sandwich.

1726
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,410
What are you?

1727
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:50,090
What are you?

1728
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,170
Oh, rabbit sandwich.

1729
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,530
Oh, rabbit sandwich.

1730
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:57,570
Uh...

1731
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,570
Uh...

1732
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,230
I'm just hoping that she'll give us more stuff.

1733
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,390
Which is why I'm...

1734
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,550
Continuing back to these once again.

1735
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:04,850
Um...

1736
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:08,110
What if this is like a cat sandwich and a piggy sandwich?

1737
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,270
Cat sandwich, piggy sandwich.

1738
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:10,810
Like this.

1739
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:14,290
And this could be a piggy something or other.

1740
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,130
Do, do, do, do, do.

1741
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:19,990
Do, do, do, do, do.

1742
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:23,510
I don't know.

1743
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:24,670
These ones are so confusing.

1744
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,070
I wish I could like write it down.

1745
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:28,950
And move it around.

1746
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:30,810
I think I saw someone say that...

1747
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:33,550
Oh, maybe this is a rice pig.

1748
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:34,930
Oh wait, no.

1749
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:35,790
Cause this wouldn't...

1750
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,290
That wouldn't work.

1751
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,170
Uh...

1752
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:40,350
Actually...

1753
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:41,910
With the way I have it, none...

1754
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,810
This doesn't work anywhere.

1755
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:45,890
Okay.

1756
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:47,130
Back to the drawing board.

1757
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:50,670
Um...

1758
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,250
Maybe not a rabbit.

1759
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:58,030
Uh...

1760
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,250
This has to be rice and...

1761
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:05,590
Eggie, I imagine.

1762
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:06,950
No.

1763
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:07,810
Oh, because it's...

1764
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:08,410
Oh, it's a sandwich.

1765
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,850
Oh, that's why we did the sandwich.

1766
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,450
Okay, hold on.

1767
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:11,510
I...

1768
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,910
Oh...

1769
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,990
Wait, how do we even do this one then?

1770
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,710
How is this one possible?

1771
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,650
Because every...

1772
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,430
Option leads us with...

1773
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,750
Today's thumbnail is so cute.

1774
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:27,810
Thank you!

1775
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,060
Pig rice in the middle.

1776
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:33,860
It has to be.

1777
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:35,620
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

1778
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,120
Piggy rice in the middle.

1779
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1780
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,760
And then this is an eggy.

1781
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,020
So this is an eggy.

1782
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,540
Uh...

1783
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,980
A cat.

1784
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,980
Oh, why did I determine it was a cat?

1785
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,660
Oh, because I was following this one, I think.

1786
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,600
Oh, so this is not a sam... cat sandwich then.

1787
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,280
Because I was following this one.

1788
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,220
That...

1789
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,700
And then this could be...

1790
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,480
The...

1791
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,880
Another eggy and a piggy.

1792
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,360
Right?

1793
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,220
Uh...

1794
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,540
So, eggs in both the bottom corners.

1795
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:24,680
Yes.

1796
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,160
Wait...

1797
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,380
Well, not necessarily.

1798
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,560
Oh yeah, wait...

1799
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,680
Because this has to be a...

1800
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,100
This could be a sandwich pig, you know?

1801
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,880
Oh no, because this has to be a sandwich.

1802
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:37,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1803
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,240
So Eggie's in both corners.

1804
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,320
Eggie in both corners.

1805
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:49,720
So I think it's gonna be... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna put rabbit and cat because it's not gonna be the piggy.

1806
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,820
Or... or it could be a piggy-eggie.

1807
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,700
No, it can't be piggy-eggie.

1808
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,640
Wait, it could be piggy-eggie.

1809
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,200
It could... be piggy-eggie.

1810
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,180
Oh!

1811
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,520
Okay, hold on.

1812
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,060
I think...

1813
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:23,160
This is either cat sandwich and... No, this has to be... Wait.

1814
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:23,640
No.

1815
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,990
Then where the heck do I put the cat and... Where the heck do I put this one?

1816
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:38,830
This one's so... This one is so confusing.

1817
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:42,790
Because it has to be...

1818
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:43,970
Rice Rabbit.

1819
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:48,710
But the corners are the piggy- or the Eggie's.

1820
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:49,590
Maybe.

1821
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:59,780
They give you so much information and so many options at the same time, you know?

1822
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,040
Oh my goodness.

1823
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,910
Rice Rabbit has to be bottom left or right?

1824
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:11,550
Yeah, that's what it seems to be.

1825
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:14,130
But we thought that those would have to be...

1826
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:14,910
Eggie.

1827
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:17,050
But it's not Eggie.

1828
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,690
Yeah, one of the bottom corners has to be a Rice Rabbit.

1829
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:24,450
So...

1830
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,370
I'm just gonna put him in this corner for right now.

1831
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:28,790
Or...

1832
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,450
Here, we'll do this.

1833
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:30,170
Cat sandwich.

1834
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:32,570
Like that.

1835
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:37,510
What if it's...

1836
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,650
Piggy sandwich.

1837
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:39,350
Piggy rice.

1838
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:39,990
Piggy eggy.

1839
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:44,170
And then a cat.

1840
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:45,730
Something here.

1841
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:47,330
I'm just...

1842
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,690
I'm just throwing out stuff right now.

1843
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:50,950
Oh no, it can't be.

1844
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:51,570
Wait.

1845
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:53,610
Because we have the double rabbit.

1846
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:54,930
We have to have a double rabbit.

1847
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,530
We have to have a double...

1848
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:05,270
So maybe this.

1849
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:08,830
What if this is a rabbit sandwich?

1850
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,170
Rabbit egg.

1851
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:11,570
Maybe.

1852
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:15,510
No.

1853
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:15,910
Sorry.

1854
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:16,490
Not Eggie.

1855
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,310
Rabbit rice.

1856
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:19,050
There we go.

1857
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,110
What in the Sudoku lunchbox?

1858
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,290
This is like...

1859
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,490
Probably...

1860
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:28,470
The more creative and interesting puzzles of this...

1861
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,030
Whole game.

1862
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:31,610
And I...

1863
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,890
Don't know if I like it or not.

1864
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:36,890
So maybe a cat sandwich here.

1865
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,230
And then cat eggy here.

1866
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,200
Wait.

1867
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,360
Piggy...

1868
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,320
One thing I don't have is a piggy egg.

1869
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,160
I can't do the piggy egg.

1870
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,500
Let me see.

1871
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,490
It also doesn't...

1872
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:16,890
So that would be solved.

1873
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:23,110
Oh, we're so close.

1874
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,850
This is the rice and the egg.

1875
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,450
This is...

1876
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,850
Oh, see also...

1877
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:29,970
Cat and rice.

1878
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,430
So it can't...

1879
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,510
It has to be the cat here.

1880
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,370
If we're doing the bunny...

1881
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,470
Here.

1882
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,470
If we're doing rice bunny there.

1883
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,070
So we have two problems.

1884
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,090
We have piggy eggy.

1885
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,730
And we have cat and bunny rice.

1886
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,590
Okay, okay, okay.

1887
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:53,210
Also pig and egg diagonal.

1888
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:53,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1889
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,630
That's why I said those are two problems.

1890
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:04,190
If rice bunny isn't bottom left...

1891
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:06,650
Or if rice bunny is bottom left...

1892
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:07,970
Cat sandal must be above it.

1893
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:09,950
Yeah.

1894
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:14,820
Yeah.

1895
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,920
So cat sandal...

1896
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,300
Plus...

1897
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,800
Oh, and then we have...

1898
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,800
Ah, then we have piggy and eggy.

1899
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,200
So now we need...

1900
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,180
Um...

1901
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,740
What was the last thing that I needed?

1902
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,220
Does that not solve my problem?

1903
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,480
Cat...

1904
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,060
Pig...

1905
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,220
Sandwich...

1906
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:38,560
Cat...

1907
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,360
Pig...

1908
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,180
Sandwich...

1909
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:40,500
Sandwich...

1910
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:40,660
Sandwich...

1911
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,400
Which one is wrong?

1912
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,360
Egg and rice is missing though.

1913
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:46,280
Ah...

1914
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:46,940
Um...

1915
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:02,130
What if we did...

1916
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:04,270
Oh, but it's rice...

1917
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:05,970
Um...

1918
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,900
Switch bunny egg and rice.

1919
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,400
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1920
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,480
Let's...

1921
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,500
Well...

1922
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,560
I'm trying to see what...

1923
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:23,780
That...

1924
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:24,960
Disrupts...

1925
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,080
Of the ecosystem.

1926
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:28,400
Ah...

1927
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,960
Oh, see, it has to be the cat bunny...

1928
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:32,860
Or the cat...

1929
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,640
Bunny rice.

1930
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,000
That's why we have that there.

1931
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,860
I feel like it has to do with something in here.

1932
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,360
I'm just trying to figure it out.

1933
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,200
What we can swap around, you know?

1934
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:45,440
Um...

1935
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:46,860
Mmm...

1936
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,260
Ben!

1937
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:48,240
Welcome to my bush.

1938
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:48,800
Thank you!

1939
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,880
Rice bunny has to have the cat above it.

1940
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1941
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:55,580
Ah...

1942
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:58,520
I think it might be egg piggy in the middle.

1943
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,760
But then we lose...

1944
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,460
Piggy...

1945
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,440
Oh no, we still have piggy egg.

1946
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,660
What do we lose now?

1947
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,640
What do we lose now?

1948
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,500
It still doesn't solve the...

1949
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,660
Rice...

1950
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,320
And...

1951
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,100
Egg...

1952
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,260
Yet.

1953
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,180
We're so close though.

1954
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,180
We're so close.

1955
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,880
I feel...

1956
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:38,790
We lose the pig and egg combo.

1957
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:39,270
No, we don't.

1958
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:40,990
Because we have kitten egg right here.

1959
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,210
So piggy egg...

1960
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,050
To kitten egg.

1961
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:44,990
So...

1962
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:45,770
That's still...

1963
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:46,870
That's still...

1964
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:47,510
But it's the...

1965
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,050
It's still the rice and the eggy...

1966
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:49,990
That we're trying to figure out.

1967
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,890
I don't think ordering bento through Sudoku is smart.

1968
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:56,430
You think?

1969
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,230
Hmm.

1970
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:00,070
Shido!

1971
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,070
Welcome to membership.

1972
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:01,650
Thank you.

1973
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,410
Oh, we see...

1974
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,390
It feels like we're so close and yet so far.

1975
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,370
I can't tell.

1976
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:08,670
This one's a tricky one, huh?

1977
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,410
My brain is...

1978
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:13,410
Cooked.

1979
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:14,210
It's cooking.

1980
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,940
Change the bunny egg and the bunny rice.

1981
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,740
We can't do that.

1982
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,760
It has to be...

1983
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,100
It has to be...

1984
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:32,560
Um...

1985
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,440
The rice under the cat.

1986
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,140
See?

1987
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,380
We have the cat and then bunny rice has to be underneath it.

1988
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,930
I just joined it.

1989
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:52,090
I have no idea what we're looking at.

1990
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:52,770
Welcome!

1991
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,790
We are...

1992
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:57,170
We are doing bento Sudoku.

1993
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:59,850
We are on random.

1994
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:00,550
Welcome to membership.

1995
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:01,550
Thank you so much.

1996
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,010
Swap the two cats.

1997
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,260
Which two cats?

1998
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:15,790
Like sandwich cat.

1999
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:17,250
Well, that...

2000
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:17,750
This one...

2001
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,570
This one...

2002
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,390
Makes up...

2003
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:22,030
It has to be sandwich here if we're doing this corner piece.

2004
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:22,950
Like so.

2005
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,570
There's a lot to keep track of.

2006
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:34,130
I know!

2007
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:35,270
It's so hard!

2008
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,250
That's why I'm like...

2009
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,030
We're so close...

2010
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:40,390
Like, we have all the things fulfilled except the one.

2011
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,190
Just take it.

2012
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,090
The customer won't know.

2013
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,710
The customer won't know!

2014
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:47,730
Oh my gosh.

2015
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:50,210
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

2016
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,770
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

2017
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:54,090
One of the races definitely needs to move.

2018
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,770
Yeah, I mean, obviously, someone needs to move because...

2019
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,590
Because...

2020
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:00,570
Because...

2021
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:00,830
Because...

2022
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:01,730
Because...

2023
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,010
Because...

2024
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:03,030
Because...

2025
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,790
Because...

2026
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:04,230
Because...

2027
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:05,530
That's the rules of the game.

2028
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,350
But I don't know why.

2029
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:14,780
Hmm.

2030
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:15,520
I don't...

2031
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,720
I don't even know if we're gonna get anything out of it for this.

2032
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,760
I'll let you go.

2033
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:21,480
Bye!

2034
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,340
We'll come back.

2035
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:26,930
I don't even know.

2036
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:31,070
So, Yumi was a flop.

2037
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:32,690
Is there anyone else we can call?

2038
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:35,710
Oh, wait.

2039
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:39,570
Savannah, maybe?

2040
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:40,510
It has some more.

2041
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:46,910
Another one.

2042
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:56,760
Now that you checked the letter, can you check the bamboo thing in the garden?

2043
01:17:58,940 --> 01:17:59,680
A letter?

2044
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,640
Um, I don't think...

2045
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,640
I think we got everything we needed out of the bamboo.

2046
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,880
That was the first monogram.

2047
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:06,900
No?

2048
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:10,680
Right?

2049
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:22,530
I'm totally stumped right now.

2050
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,750
Oh, wait.

2051
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:27,890
Ah!

2052
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:30,850
Okay, okay, okay.

2053
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:31,510
Finally.

2054
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,590
Okay, so let's go to Kurei.

2055
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:35,230
For Pacheco.

2056
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:36,410
Oh, okay, finally.

2057
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:39,370
Oh, not Pachinko, sorry.

2058
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,510
For the Purikura.

2059
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:42,790
Okay, okay, okay.

2060
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,630
Wait, I'm sorry.

2061
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:45,650
What was that picture?

2062
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:46,990
I just noticed, wait.

2063
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:51,070
Why, how did she get Rintaro to take a picture with her?

2064
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:54,370
I assume we use this machine to print them out.

2065
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,050
Yes, yes, print.

2066
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:58,170
Connect phone.

2067
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:02,610
How do I connect?

2068
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:04,790
How to connect?

2069
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:06,150
Connect phone.

2070
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:08,270
It's out of order.

2071
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:09,710
Wait.

2072
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:10,990
Insert phone here.

2073
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:11,670
Oh, there we go, okay.

2074
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:15,670
Print.

2075
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,510
Do I have to do them each individually?

2076
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,090
Okay.

2077
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:25,810
Okay, each individually.

2078
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:28,190
Rintaro cheating?

2079
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:28,970
No way.

2080
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,070
Thank you, game.

2081
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:36,810
Thank you, game.

2082
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,130
What is that last picture?

2083
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,650
I don't know.

2084
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:41,150
It's got an eggy.

2085
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:41,850
I don't know.

2086
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,970
Oh, shoot.

2087
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,310
Wait, did I just print this one?

2088
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:46,090
Oh, gosh.

2089
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:46,890
I can't remember now.

2090
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,380
We're missing two, maybe?

2091
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,580
Oh,

2092
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,940
I got an eggy.

2093
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,980
Something's not right here.

2094
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,080
Something's not right here.

2095
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,460
Okay, I think I got all of them.

2096
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,630
What do I do with the cat egg?

2097
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:23,110
What the hell?

2098
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,370
Let me try calling Yumi again.

2099
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:35,980
Maybe she's...

2100
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:36,480
Hello.

2101
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:37,380
Oh, my God.

2102
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:39,180
Yumi, pick up the phone.

2103
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,640
Pick up the phone.

2104
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,160
Let's see.

2105
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:48,560
How can I arrange...

2106
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,820
Where can I arrange these at?

2107
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,360
Maybe her place.

2108
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:51,940
I don't know.

2109
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,760
That was effectively an achievement.

2110
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,400
That's what the standard noise...

2111
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,540
Whenever you get an achievement in these...

2112
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,360
No, I've only gotten one achievement.

2113
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,060
Now she's doing crimes.

2114
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,020
Oh, Yumi.

2115
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,620
Maybe because she's got the program on her computer.

2116
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,940
I love that we still have the...

2117
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,560
Keys to her place.

2118
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:23,660
Oh, wait.

2119
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,900
No, this is pretty good.

2120
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:25,520
What am I thinking?

2121
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,360
Where can I arrange these at?

2122
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,040
How well do you think Columbo would do in this case?

2123
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:38,700
Oh, my gosh.

2124
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,660
Nancy Drew Columbo crossover would go so hard.

2125
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,200
Finding a table.

2126
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,840
There's plenty of tables around here.

2127
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:53,700
Let's go back.

2128
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,420
Let me arrange them, please.

2129
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:07,460
Was it called?

2130
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,760
Move along, folks?

2131
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,100
What the hell does that mean?

2132
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,280
What the hell does that mean?

2133
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:16,840
Go back to the Purikura.

2134
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,660
You think it'll let me?

2135
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:32,830
If I were wanting to go to Japan, but I was nervous about the train system, I would be terrified.

2136
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,350
Seeing this, I would be like, there's no way.

2137
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:38,590
My eyes.

2138
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:40,530
There's no way I'll ever go to Japan.

2139
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:53,330
Where am I supposed to set these up so I can arrange them?

2140
01:22:57,690 --> 01:23:00,070
I believe there's a design on the bottom of the machine.

2141
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:01,610
Oh, my God.

2142
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:02,910
I see it.

2143
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:05,870
Wait, but it won't let me use it.

2144
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,790
Wait.

2145
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,010
Please, let me use it.

2146
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:18,250
Let me use it.

2147
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:21,710
Maybe I have to go talk to Yumi again.

2148
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:23,250
That's the only thing I can think of.

2149
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:30,970
Maybe if I'm like, Yumi, you've been sending me all these things.

2150
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,950
And she's like, oh, yeah, you can arrange them.

2151
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:34,650
It's going to be some...

2152
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:39,030
Some arbitrary opening, I feel.

2153
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:42,110
There's no sequence breaking in this game.

2154
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:43,690
Uh...

2155
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:45,570
She was in Matsui.

2156
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:00,000
I really like the picture of you and Rantaro.

2157
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:00,860
Thanks.

2158
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,620
Her interactive should make a game crossover with Mint.

2159
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:05,360
No.

2160
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,880
The newest game should not...

2161
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,340
Wait.

2162
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,600
The newest game is not the best, but if Mint is in it, I will play without question.

2163
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,480
Me and the game?

2164
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,280
I'll talk to you later.

2165
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,340
See you later.

2166
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:25,180
It shouldn't tell us anything.

2167
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,620
I think we're missing a photo.

2168
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:37,920
Possibly.

2169
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,680
It looked like we were missing two, actually.

2170
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:46,100
Just based on, like, the number that we are able to print out.

2171
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:00,750
Possibly two, unless this is another Easter egg.

2172
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,490
Oscar Rantaro.

2173
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:04,250
Maybe, yeah.

2174
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:05,190
Let's go talk to him.

2175
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:13,930
Hey, Rantaro, what are you doing taking Purikura with your sister's boyfriend, huh?

2176
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:15,890
Awfully sus.

2177
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:17,750
Awfully sus.

2178
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,560
I can't tell.

2179
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,820
It seems like she sends them at random.

2180
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,900
So hopefully that's not the case.

2181
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:33,940
Rantyarno.

2182
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,040
No.

2183
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,740
Let's go see what Miwako says about that.

2184
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,000
Let's go see what Miwako...

2185
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,760
I'm talent.

2186
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,520
I'm snitching.

2187
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,560
I'm snitching.

2188
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,140
Hi.

2189
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,680
I should go.

2190
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:06,900
I'll talk to you later.

2191
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:07,380
Nancy.

2192
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:07,940
Okay, see ya.

2193
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,840
You are so nosy and yet...

2194
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:14,130
I'm at a loss.

2195
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,330
I'm at a loss.

2196
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:18,730
What to do?

2197
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:24,680
Why is he visiting his girlfriend's sister's place?

2198
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:25,420
I know.

2199
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:29,740
Arrange him in our room.

2200
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:31,960
Yeah, that's where I was originally going to head to.

2201
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,800
Let's try it.

2202
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:42,700
No.

2203
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,750
The game isn't telling me anything!

2204
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:49,270
Nancy Drew!

2205
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:50,930
Please!

2206
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,370
This feels so...

2207
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:56,710
What?

2208
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,710
I have no direction.

2209
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:02,470
Oh my gosh.

2210
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,030
Kuro, thank you so much for the...

2211
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:04,990
Haka Super!

2212
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,370
Finally got my very first pay check.

2213
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:08,590
No, please!

2214
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,010
You didn't have to say so much though.

2215
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:11,910
May 2nd...

2216
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:14,130
Will forever be known as the day of gold.

2217
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:14,810
Oh my...

2218
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:17,230
Congratulations!

2219
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,910
I'm gonna try calling Bess again.

2220
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,510
Maybe I have to...

2221
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:26,330
Nancy, how's it going?

2222
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,170
Here, maybe this.

2223
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:29,210
Yumi sent me a great picture of you two.

2224
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:30,990
Oh, isn't that cool?

2225
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:33,170
I love the Porakura booth here.

2226
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:33,730
Porakura?

2227
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,430
I'll show you where a really great one is.

2228
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:38,390
If you get done with your mystery before we have to head back home.

2229
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:39,090
Porakura.

2230
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:39,690
I'm working on it.

2231
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:42,090
I promise I'll see you guys soon.

2232
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:45,910
Takai is really difficult to talk to sometimes.

2233
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:48,550
I think she might be hiding something.

2234
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:52,430
From what Yumi says, Takai may be a lot less sweet than she seems.

2235
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:53,470
How so?

2236
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:58,670
Yumi didn't really say, but I get the sense that she thinks Takai might be behind the hauntings.

2237
01:27:58,870 --> 01:28:05,590
She told me that Takai never believed in the supernatural until recently, which seems a little suspicious to me.

2238
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,930
I'll talk to you later.

2239
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:10,530
Bye!

2240
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:12,530
Interesting.

2241
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:13,390
What time is it?

2242
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:16,970
Well, it's time to go talk to Grandma.

2243
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:25,090
I like how fast it seems like we're speeding down the hallways of this place.

2244
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,470
Hello, Nancy-san.

2245
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,610
Excuse me?

2246
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:30,970
Were you ever married?

2247
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:31,970
Of course.

2248
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:34,230
Your husband, he...

2249
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:37,370
He would have been very impressed with you.

2250
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:37,950
Impressed.

2251
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:40,110
He loved questions, too.

2252
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:45,210
My friends would say, tell him enough with the interrogations.

2253
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:50,150
But if he liked someone, he wanted to know everything.

2254
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:52,070
She was married to Columbo.

2255
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:55,830
And I'm impressed.

2256
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:57,590
Okay?

2257
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,030
I should go.

2258
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:00,450
I'll talk to you later.

2259
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,370
Goodbye, Nancy-san.

2260
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:03,490
Nancy-san.

2261
01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:04,950
Please say it correctly.

2262
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:07,190
You're disgracing my culture.

2263
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:09,450
Hi.

2264
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,130
I'll talk to you later.

2265
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:12,130
Okay, see ya.

2266
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:14,890
Guys, I don't know.

2267
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:17,550
Let me try calling George, I suppose.

2268
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:21,050
Call everybody, I guess.

2269
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:21,730
I don't know.

2270
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:25,930
I still don't know what her accent's supposed to be.

2271
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:27,130
I'm sick.

2272
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:28,410
I'll let you get back to work.

2273
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,570
I can't deal with these accents anymore.

2274
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,570
Okay, Savannah was nothing.

2275
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:33,770
I'll try again.

2276
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,530
Call out of God.

2277
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,850
I wish.

2278
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:38,250
Savannah here?

2279
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:39,590
I should go.

2280
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:40,470
Bye now.

2281
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,670
Bye-bye now.

2282
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:43,770
And Yumi never picks up.

2283
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:46,330
Hello.

2284
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:47,870
Not in.

2285
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:49,030
Bye-bye.

2286
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:51,350
Change your...

2287
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,210
Change your...

2288
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:53,970
Your voicemail.

2289
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,850
Thank you so much for the vibe gift.

2290
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:57,710
And thank you.

2291
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:00,510
I know.

2292
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:02,010
Every conversation is, hey.

2293
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:03,470
Okay, I should go.

2294
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:04,430
Bye-bye.

2295
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:07,230
Sleep, maybe.

2296
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:09,030
I guess.

2297
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:14,900
I have no idea.

2298
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,180
Let's sleep until 7 p.m.

2299
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,120
Oh boy, 7 p.m.

2300
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,880
How'd it get so late already?

2301
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,360
I should get to bed.

2302
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,660
Nancy, it's 9.

2303
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,530
Oh, sorry.

2304
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:41,230
That was my alarm.

2305
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:41,690
Dang it.

2306
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:42,310
I thought it was...

2307
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:44,870
We have no more homework.

2308
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:47,010
I seriously have no idea what to do.

2309
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:49,070
I'm about to consult...

2310
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:51,110
...old reliable...

2311
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:52,370
...walkthrough...

2312
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:53,110
...game facts.

2313
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,230
I'm about to consult game facts.

2314
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:02,910
There should be 7 pictures.

2315
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:07,980
We need one more.

2316
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,920
How do we get the last one?

2317
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:18,450
Justin, thank you so much for the 5 gift attack.

2318
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:27,680
I don't know.

2319
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,040
I don't know.

2320
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:28,780
Hey.

2321
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,740
I'll let you get back to work.

2322
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,020
Catch you around.

2323
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,140
Yumi, please.

2324
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,300
Go back to Purikura.

2325
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,840
Just wait until she sends the last one.

2326
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:44,580
Is it time-based?

2327
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,760
Let's see.

2328
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,200
2 game facts.

2329
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,260
Oh, sorry.

2330
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,700
This is game Zeebo.

2331
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,280
That's what I'm looking at.

2332
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:56,920
Let's see.

2333
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,200
Okay, I did that.

2334
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,460
Hidden passage.

2335
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,140
Did that.

2336
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,660
You should have 7...

2337
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:08,700
...plus a blurry...

2338
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,100
...black and white one.

2339
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:11,740
If you don't have all 7...

2340
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,240
...she will send them to you soon.

2341
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,080
So go and play more Pachinko or something.

2342
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,380
That's literally what the guide just says.

2343
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,380
Oh my god.

2344
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,140
No way.

2345
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:27,020
Okay.

2346
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,900
Time to go play more Pachinko or something.

2347
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:33,820
I guess we'll...

2348
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:36,180
We'll become the greatest Pachinko player ever.

2349
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,320
The luckiest to ever do it.

2350
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:42,480
Back to Bento.

2351
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:43,620
Oh yeah.

2352
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:44,880
We gotta solve that Bento, huh?

2353
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,000
Okay, we'll go solve the Bento.

2354
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:50,840
Oh, oops.

2355
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,780
Sorry, I went back home.

2356
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,980
I went back home.

2357
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:54,880
What's it?

2358
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,280
Okay.

2359
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,060
Hello.

2360
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:08,820
Hello.

2361
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:11,000
I'm ready to help with more Bento.

2362
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,780
It reset it.

2363
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:16,580
No!

2364
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,500
No way!

2365
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,900
It reset it!

2366
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:28,710
No stinking way.

2367
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:30,530
I'm sorry, guys.

2368
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:31,270
I'm sorry.

2369
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:34,670
This one seems easier, though.

2370
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:35,570
Look, look, look.

2371
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:36,890
It can...

2372
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:39,450
So the bear has to be one of these two.

2373
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:42,150
That doesn't seem so bad.

2374
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:45,130
So bear rice has to be one of these two.

2375
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:47,770
Oh, okay.

2376
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:50,790
Is this like dominoes?

2377
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:53,170
Actually, I don't know how to properly play dominoes.

2378
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,370
I only know how to set them up and let them rip.

2379
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:02,640
I'm sorry, guys.

2380
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,200
I had no idea I would do that.

2381
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,080
But...

2382
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:16,630
I was gonna say...

2383
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:19,610
This has to be...

2384
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,350
Piggy sandwich.

2385
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,110
But a piggy sandwich...

2386
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:24,550
Could be this one.

2387
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:25,410
Or this one.

2388
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,200
You connect side numbers and dominoes.

2389
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:35,680
Oh.

2390
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:36,920
Wait.

2391
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:40,880
Side number.

2392
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,000
Like two would go to two.

2393
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,300
And then on the other side, say there's a six.

2394
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:45,800
It would...

2395
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,700
It would touch butts with six.

2396
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:49,380
Okay.

2397
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,260
Middle row has to be all rise.

2398
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,080
If we're following this.

2399
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,680
Because it could be...

2400
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,380
The top row has to be all rise.

2401
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,140
You know?

2402
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:58,500
Oh, wait a second, though.

2403
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,200
It has to be...

2404
01:34:59,200 --> 01:34:59,580
Actually, no.

2405
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,620
This definitely does have to be where the bear is.

2406
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:03,800
Because...

2407
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:05,820
Wait.

2408
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:06,620
Hold on.

2409
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,480
I wish I could draw these out.

2410
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:08,900
Oh, my God.

2411
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,320
Like, I wish I could place these, you know, in here.

2412
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,000
Um...

2413
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:21,960
Yeah.

2414
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:22,440
Okay.

2415
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:23,900
Because of this...

2416
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,240
Because this is rice, we know rice has to be in the middle.

2417
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:27,580
Okay.

2418
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:27,820
Okay.

2419
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:27,960
Okay.

2420
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,500
Mm-mm-mm.

2421
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,060
So, then this is a cat.

2422
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:32,360
This is bear sent...

2423
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:32,480
Oh.

2424
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:33,820
Bear...

2425
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,040
This is bear sent...

2426
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:35,500
Bear sandwich.

2427
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,540
This is bear...

2428
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,460
Why did I put bear sandwich up there?

2429
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,760
So, then this is cat cat.

2430
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,020
Why did I put bear sandwich up there?

2431
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,080
So, then this is cat rice.

2432
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,620
And this is piggy rice.

2433
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:02,790
Why did I put that up there?

2434
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:04,790
I don't know.

2435
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:07,710
Mysterious.

2436
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:08,430
This puzzle hurts...

2437
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:09,010
My brain.

2438
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,430
This puzzle hurts my brain.

2439
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:13,510
Yeah.

2440
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:14,790
Me too.

2441
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:15,570
A little bit.

2442
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:17,770
Me too.

2443
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:18,210
A little.

2444
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:21,270
I think this is cat sandwich.

2445
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:24,550
Or...

2446
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:25,230
Yeah.

2447
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:25,610
Hmm?

2448
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:28,590
I think this is cat sandwich.

2449
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:30,350
Yeah.

2450
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:32,170
Because cat eggy has to be up top.

2451
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:36,410
I think this is cat egg.

2452
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:39,690
Because...

2453
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:39,990
Yeah.

2454
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:42,370
And then this is piggy...

2455
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:42,950
Something.

2456
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:44,030
Piggy...

2457
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:44,310
What else?

2458
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:45,690
Piggy...

2459
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:48,750
Because this could be piggy sandwich.

2460
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,410
And this could be piggy egg.

2461
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:51,450
And this...

2462
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:54,960
Oh, no.

2463
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:55,500
Oh!

2464
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,440
Okay, never mind.

2465
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:57,100
I see.

2466
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:58,780
Wait.

2467
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:00,720
Bear egg.

2468
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:15,370
Oh, no.

2469
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:16,210
My brain hurts.

2470
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:17,210
Oh, no.

2471
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:17,830
My brain hurts.

2472
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:19,810
Oh, no.

2473
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,370
My brain hurts.

2474
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:21,110
Okay, hold on.

2475
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:25,330
We know!

2476
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:31,010
This is probably correct.

2477
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:38,100
I'm buying with coworkers a round of Mexican Cokes.

2478
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,420
What's the difference between...

2479
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:41,520
What's the difference?

2480
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,600
Is there a difference in...

2481
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,580
Coca-Cola flavor around the world?

2482
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,120
Oh, real sugar.

2483
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:51,880
Oh!

2484
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,120
The sugar type.

2485
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,540
Cane sugar.

2486
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:56,680
Ah!

2487
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,920
People say it tastes better.

2488
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,500
It must if it's real sugar instead of corn syrup.

2489
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:06,600
Um...

2490
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,000
I don't know how it would be.

2491
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,760
Sounds like you mean...

2492
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,880
To complete more Ren Taro's puzzles.

2493
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:13,740
Sometimes...

2494
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:14,180
It...

2495
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,420
The trigger glitches.

2496
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,200
No!

2497
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,100
So not...

2498
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:17,520
Oh, wait.

2499
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:19,560
I'm ready to help with more bento.

2500
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2501
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,220
Okay.

2502
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,760
I'll let you get back to work.

2503
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,360
Bye!

2504
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:31,240
Sorry, guys.

2505
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:33,540
It's fine.

2506
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,760
Let's do some Sudoku.

2507
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,140
Actually, let's...

2508
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,560
Yeah, let's do Sudoku.

2509
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,420
We'll just do the...

2510
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:38,960
Oops, my bad.

2511
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,720
We'll do the easy things.

2512
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,360
Which one...

2513
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,120
Which book was it?

2514
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:46,160
Which book was it?

2515
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,840
This is our...

2516
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,920
Dictionary.

2517
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:52,520
What's this?

2518
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:53,860
Flyer.

2519
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:55,980
Flyer.

2520
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,020
Pants on fire.

2521
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,380
Wait, where's my...

2522
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,600
Where's my puzzle book?

2523
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,340
Oh, my puzzle book is missing.

2524
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:07,380
Just kidding.

2525
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,720
What the heck is a Renogram?

2526
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,560
Oh, God.

2527
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:15,380
It looks so...

2528
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:16,320
I'm gonna throw up.

2529
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,800
I'm gonna throw up.

2530
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:23,740
Okay.

2531
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:25,480
Okay.

2532
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:30,560
This can't be two.

2533
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,220
This or this could be two.

2534
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:40,990
No, don't throw.

2535
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:41,950
You're so pretty.

2536
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:46,870
This one's not so bad.

2537
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:48,090
I may be because...

2538
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:48,450
Okay, wait.

2539
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:48,930
One.

2540
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:49,350
Okay.

2541
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:49,750
Two.

2542
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:51,210
Four.

2543
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:51,870
Five.

2544
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:52,050
Five.

2545
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:54,750
So, this is five.

2546
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:57,170
This is four.

2547
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:00,450
Wait.

2548
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:02,110
Why did I determine that?

2549
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:03,030
I don't know.

2550
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:07,830
Did I put in that nine here?

2551
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:09,370
I didn't mean to put that in.

2552
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:10,590
Did they put that in for me?

2553
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:12,170
Did I put that in?

2554
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:13,050
I don't know.

2555
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,300
I was right?

2556
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2557
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:21,780
Okay, that's because of the four.

2558
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,860
Okay, I knew I had a method to my madness.

2559
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,360
I knew I had a method.

2560
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,980
I was like, how did I see that so fast?

2561
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:30,820
Nine would have gone in there anyway.

2562
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:31,660
How?

2563
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,420
Maybe the game was kind.

2564
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,040
Okay, so we need four...

2565
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:39,800
And six.

2566
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:43,420
Four and six.

2567
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:44,660
We don't know yet.

2568
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,580
The erase above the tanooki...

2569
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:52,200
It looks...

2570
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,400
It doesn't look evil.

2571
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,100
So, two is one of these.

2572
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,930
I don't know which one next is easy to solve.

2573
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:23,910
Seven in the bottom right.

2574
01:41:24,290 --> 01:41:24,850
This one?

2575
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:26,030
Micmac!

2576
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,610
Thank you so much for the...

2577
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:28,890
For the gifted.

2578
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:29,450
Thank you!

2579
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:33,650
The tanooki looks so moi-kawaii.

2580
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:36,510
Okay, so we need two here.

2581
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:37,690
So, two goes up here.

2582
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:40,010
We need three, uh...

2583
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:41,710
Four, five, six...

2584
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:43,850
Seven...

2585
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,200
Eight and nine.

2586
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:49,060
Wait.

2587
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:50,580
Wait.

2588
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,200
Oh, we're missing one.

2589
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,240
Okay, one is here.

2590
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,600
And eight is here.

2591
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:57,580
Like that.

2592
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,840
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2593
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:03,640
Um...

2594
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:07,080
Do I have to complete this and then be like, I need more Sudoku?

2595
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,780
Maybe then we'll get a...

2596
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:20,800
Five...

2597
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:22,740
Six...

2598
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:24,380
One square...

2599
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:25,420
One square, done!

2600
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:29,140
Um...

2601
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:31,360
And two is one of these.

2602
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,320
And we need three also.

2603
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:40,270
So one is two and one is three.

2604
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:47,720
I wish I could like, tentative...

2605
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,400
I wish I could put like, a tentative two.

2606
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:50,400
Three.

2607
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,060
Buttertoe is all good about you.

2608
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:53,760
Thank you.

2609
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,180
Okay, um...

2610
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,420
Oh, one.

2611
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,500
Two, uh...

2612
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:01,880
Three.

2613
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,760
Four is one of these as well.

2614
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:05,720
Five.

2615
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,100
Seven.

2616
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:12,310
I think this is...

2617
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:13,350
Eight.

2618
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,260
Nine.

2619
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:20,900
Four.

2620
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:23,940
I think.

2621
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:25,900
Scratches at...

2622
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:26,940
Scratches at two.

2623
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,360
With deeper grooves at level three.

2624
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:35,780
Um...

2625
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,000
I'm not guessing on eight and nine.

2626
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:38,780
I don't think.

2627
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:39,340
Am I?

2628
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:39,920
Oh, wait.

2629
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:40,640
Maybe I am.

2630
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,280
Wait.

2631
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,500
Why did I guess that?

2632
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,180
Okay.

2633
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:46,740
You're right.

2634
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,760
Maybe I am guessing.

2635
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:48,620
Okay.

2636
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:49,040
Yeah.

2637
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,260
Mito, don't guess!

2638
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,160
I didn't try!

2639
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:52,120
I thought I was right!

2640
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:52,440
Okay!

2641
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:52,620
Eight!

2642
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,400
I didn't try to guess!

2643
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:55,780
I didn't try to guess!

2644
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:57,700
I didn't try!

2645
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,260
I made a mistake!

2646
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,640
My brain put eight here, okay?

2647
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,800
I mistook the three for an eight!

2648
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:10,560
Ugh!

2649
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,400
This has to be three.

2650
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,100
Because there's three in here.

2651
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:28,010
Five.

2652
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:31,010
Oh, wait.

2653
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:31,870
This can't be five.

2654
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:34,250
Oh, there's five here.

2655
01:44:34,410 --> 01:44:34,770
Just kidding.

2656
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:36,210
Six.

2657
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:36,270
Six.

2658
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,950
So it's six and eight.

2659
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:42,450
Like that.

2660
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,790
Like that.

2661
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:47,950
Hmm.

2662
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:53,170
And then...

2663
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:56,250
Clear that four.

2664
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:57,410
What do you mean, that four?

2665
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:58,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

2666
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,000
Okay, let's see.

2667
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:15,990
So this is still, what?

2668
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:16,870
Two and three, right?

2669
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:17,790
We still don't know, though.

2670
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,040
So...

2671
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,880
I think this is two.

2672
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,340
I think that's two.

2673
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,840
Because there's two here.

2674
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,860
Two here.

2675
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:53,460
Uh, three...

2676
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:55,120
Would be this one.

2677
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:57,100
Four.

2678
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,080
Five.

2679
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:58,660
Six.

2680
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,440
Seven.

2681
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:02,440
Okay, that's another row.

2682
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:03,640
That's another row.

2683
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:06,360
Ah.

2684
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:10,920
Okay.

2685
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:17,380
Hey.

2686
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:25,460
Vodwatcher skipped 15 minutes.

2687
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:26,860
Please don't make fun of me.

2688
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:27,960
How slow I am.

2689
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:28,360
Okay.

2690
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:29,780
Please.

2691
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:33,820
I will cry.

2692
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,240
I see numbers and I start to cry.

2693
01:46:58,660 --> 01:46:59,260
Okay.

2694
01:46:59,460 --> 01:46:59,980
Okay, okay.

2695
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,720
I need to stop reading chat.

2696
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:04,940
And just focus my full brain.

2697
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:14,700
So one is either...

2698
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,220
This or this.

2699
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:25,590
What do we...

2700
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:26,230
Also missing.

2701
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:26,730
Two.

2702
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:31,780
Which is...

2703
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:33,020
Oh, this is the same.

2704
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,420
Where it's like one and two...

2705
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,060
Wait.

2706
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:39,660
Wasn't this...

2707
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,440
What were these two?

2708
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,920
Oh no, I forgot.

2709
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:45,480
Uh...

2710
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,140
I forgot.

2711
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:49,340
Sudoku was one of my favorite games growing up.

2712
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,060
Until Fred...

2713
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:50,740
Who's Fred?

2714
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:52,380
Who's Fred?

2715
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:53,260
Freddy Flintstone.

2716
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,140
Fred Scooby-Doo.

2717
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,340
Oh, two and three.

2718
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:57,700
Okay.

2719
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:07,390
Thank you for the super time.

2720
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:09,630
Freddy Fazbear!

2721
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:13,790
That's Freddy.

2722
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:14,550
That's not Fred.

2723
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:16,810
That's Freddy.

2724
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:16,870
That's Freddy.

2725
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:22,590
Second from the bottom.

2726
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:23,470
This one?

2727
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,750
That's what I'm looking at, too.

2728
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:26,710
One, two, three.

2729
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:30,410
We're missing four.

2730
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:33,050
And six, it seems.

2731
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:38,830
I don't think it's pot.

2732
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:40,030
How is it...

2733
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:41,210
Oh, wait.

2734
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:42,050
It is possible.

2735
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:42,990
Because we have a six here.

2736
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:43,450
Four.

2737
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,790
Six.

2738
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:46,470
Oh, thank you.

2739
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:49,590
I see, I see.

2740
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:57,290
I'm using my brain!

2741
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:03,110
I'm so tired.

2742
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:06,610
I'm so tired.

2743
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,710
Even in the afterlife, I'll have to do math.

2744
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:15,330
What a pain.

2745
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:22,970
This music is going to make me go insane.

2746
01:49:24,330 --> 01:49:24,450
Wait.

2747
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:25,330
One, two.

2748
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:26,890
Okay, so one, three.

2749
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:28,650
Seven.

2750
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:29,950
Seven.

2751
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:31,430
Okay, I don't think I can...

2752
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,630
Oh, wait.

2753
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:35,050
Seven is one of these.

2754
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:42,380
And not...

2755
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,700
And three is...

2756
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:45,340
Wait, okay, hold on.

2757
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,000
Seven can't be this.

2758
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:52,520
But three or one could be either.

2759
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:54,120
Right?

2760
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:55,260
Yeah.

2761
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:56,200
I don't know.

2762
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,200
Did she ask for help, chat?

2763
01:49:59,400 --> 01:49:59,680
No.

2764
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,840
I'm trying to solve it all on my own.

2765
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,620
I'm trying to solve it all on my own.

2766
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,820
So you can shout to the void.

2767
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,320
You can shout to the void.

2768
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:13,560
You can use my chat to shout to the void.

2769
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:29,100
But it's hard for me to figure out where to start.

2770
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,180
Like...

2771
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:39,060
It could be anywhere.

2772
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:40,740
It could be any...

2773
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:43,640
Two, three.

2774
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,220
Four can't be this one.

2775
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:46,580
Oh, wait.

2776
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,580
Four is this one.

2777
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:48,800
Four.

2778
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:49,840
Five.

2779
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,720
Six is not this one.

2780
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:52,080
Or this one.

2781
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:52,900
So six.

2782
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:55,140
Seven.

2783
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:56,840
Can't be that one.

2784
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:57,340
So it's middle.

2785
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:57,740
Seven.

2786
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:58,340
Eight.

2787
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,320
Nine.

2788
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:01,280
Wait.

2789
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:02,360
What do you mean it can't be four?

2790
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:05,740
Oh!

2791
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:06,500
Oh, I saw it.

2792
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,120
I just saw it.

2793
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:07,380
Okay.

2794
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:08,480
Redo.

2795
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,840
One, two.

2796
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,460
Oh, wait.

2797
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:16,980
This is three.

2798
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:17,420
For sure.

2799
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,620
One, two, three.

2800
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,140
Aw.

2801
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:24,580
Four.

2802
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:25,840
Okay.

2803
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,200
There we go.

2804
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:26,600
There we go.

2805
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,140
Okay.

2806
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:28,400
Okay.

2807
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:28,760
Okay.

2808
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,940
Oh, there's five.

2809
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:36,680
I was going to say, wait.

2810
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:37,200
Wait.

2811
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:39,060
But I can't put five anywhere.

2812
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:39,860
Five.

2813
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:40,960
Six.

2814
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:42,540
Can't be that.

2815
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:45,980
Can't be this.

2816
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,360
Six.

2817
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:51,040
Seven.

2818
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:55,100
It's either.

2819
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:57,360
Eight.

2820
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,260
Or nine.

2821
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,120
Okay.

2822
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:03,000
I fixed it.

2823
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:07,120
I fixed it.

2824
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:08,240
Ugh.

2825
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:09,360
Thank you, guys.

2826
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:10,760
Thank you.

2827
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:12,420
Okay.

2828
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:15,840
This is one.

2829
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:19,380
Two.

2830
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:20,000
Three.

2831
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:20,560
Four.

2832
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:25,350
Five.

2833
01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:27,090
Five is up here.

2834
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:28,370
Five.

2835
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:34,380
So quiet.

2836
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,620
Don't know which one.

2837
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:37,960
Six.

2838
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:38,920
Seven.

2839
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:40,840
Okay.

2840
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:42,520
So, we don't know this one.

2841
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,360
I don't think.

2842
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:44,680
Oh, wait.

2843
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:45,100
Yes, we do.

2844
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:45,680
Six.

2845
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:46,980
Eight.

2846
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:53,090
Thank you.

2847
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,020
So, this is three.

2848
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:00,700
Four.

2849
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:01,000
Five.

2850
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:01,400
Six.

2851
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:02,020
Seven.

2852
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:02,840
Eight.

2853
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:03,320
Nine.

2854
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:09,280
Which made this one eight, right?

2855
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:10,640
Yeah.

2856
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:11,060
Yeah.

2857
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:12,220
Oh.

2858
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:13,180
Oh.

2859
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:13,720
Oh.

2860
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,400
Okay.

2861
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,180
You're doing it, boss.

2862
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:22,120
I'm doing it.

2863
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:22,700
Slowly.

2864
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:23,880
Minto pace.

2865
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,100
Minto pace.

2866
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,100
So, this one is 2.

2867
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:40,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

2868
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:57,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

2869
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:07,060
I can't tell if this is... I guess this is way easier than the bentos, I feel.

2870
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:10,080
Wait, let her cook.

2871
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,800
I'm cooking, I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

2872
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,440
I'm in the kitchen.

2873
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:14,320
I'm serving the bestest meal.

2874
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:16,960
Be our guest.

2875
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:18,460
Be our guest.

2876
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:27,240
5, 6, 7, 8.

2877
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:30,760
9.

2878
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,420
Minto pace equals best pace.

2879
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:35,100
Thank you.

2880
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:39,940
2, 3, 4,

2881
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:46,610
wait.

2882
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:51,390
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

2883
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:53,230
So, it's gotta be 4.

2884
01:54:54,710 --> 01:54:57,290
5, 6, 7, 8.

2885
01:54:58,090 --> 01:54:58,210
9.

2886
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:02,210
My job today has been such a pain in the amount of hoops.

2887
01:55:02,490 --> 01:55:02,890
No.

2888
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:05,970
At least I have Minto Sudoku.

2889
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:13,330
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, there's steam coming out my ears.

2890
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:22,470
5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

2891
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:24,570
5, 6,

2892
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,030
7, 8, 9.

2893
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,970
Oh, we're almost there.

2894
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:35,390
We're almost there.

2895
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,600
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

2896
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:44,260
This is where I start to get a little crunchy though.

2897
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:48,580
Because there's so many numbers everywhere that my, I physically can't see them.

2898
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:51,640
Like, it actually starts to hurt my eyes.

2899
01:55:52,300 --> 01:56:00,280
1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.

2900
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:04,560
So, 4, 8.

2901
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,280
Like that.

2902
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,180
And crunching numbers.

2903
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,560
Okay.

2904
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,140
1 and 2.

2905
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:19,520
1 and 2.

2906
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:23,400
Okay.

2907
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:30,520
1, 2, 3.

2908
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:34,700
I did it!

2909
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:40,320
Alright, send me a thing, please.

2910
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,040
Okay, let's go to...

2911
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,020
Let's go back home.

2912
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,160
I did it!

2913
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:50,900
Let's go ask him for another one.

2914
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:51,960
We're not gonna do it.

2915
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:54,100
Let's go ask him for another.

2916
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:58,040
And maybe we'll get the text.

2917
01:56:58,740 --> 01:56:59,980
Listen for the elephant.

2918
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:03,100
The elephant will be our side.

2919
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:03,480
Hey!

2920
01:57:04,580 --> 01:57:06,240
I finished at the Sudoku.

2921
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:07,320
Way to go!

2922
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:09,540
So, what do you think?

2923
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,100
It's not really my thing.

2924
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:12,960
Hmm.

2925
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:15,960
I'll have to keep an eye on you, Nancy.

2926
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,360
You're trying to get me all wound up.

2927
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,460
Not a big fan.

2928
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:24,500
I've got one last type of puzzle to show you.

2929
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,620
This is one of my favorites.

2930
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:28,240
Thank you, thank you so much for the Five Gifted.

2931
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,220
Renograms.

2932
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:32,240
It's all about creating an unbroken string of numbers.

2933
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:34,740
Tell me what you think when you're done.

2934
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:35,360
Okay.

2935
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:36,240
Here you go.

2936
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:37,100
Thank you.

2937
01:57:39,820 --> 01:57:41,000
I should go.

2938
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:42,160
I'll talk to you later.

2939
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:42,920
Bye.

2940
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:44,280
I've never heard of this before.

2941
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:44,860
Is this real?

2942
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,440
Renogram.

2943
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:49,740
Where's our puzzle book?

2944
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:50,520
Oh, here.

2945
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:58,040
Fill the grid with available numbers to create a single consecutive string from 1 to 56.

2946
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:03,160
With each number connecting to the next along a...

2947
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:03,940
Huh?

2948
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:06,760
The next horizontal vertical...

2949
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:08,200
Has anybody heard of this before?

2950
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:10,300
Oh, hold on.

2951
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:11,400
I have to pee real quick.

2952
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:12,160
I'll be right back.

2953
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:14,800
Wait, what?

2954
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,160
Seems easy enough.

2955
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,940
Okay, you guys solve it while I go to the bathroom.

2956
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:20,620
I'll be right back.

2957
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,000
What the heck is this?

2958
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:05,100
It kind of sucks that...

2959
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:07,020
Did we get an elephant noise or anything?

2960
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:11,360
It kind of sucks that we're trapped in the void until...

2961
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:13,520
We're trapped until we get a text message.

2962
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,460
We can't do anything.

2963
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:16,540
It's not as hard as it looks.

2964
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:17,320
Oh, my gosh.

2965
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:19,360
There's so many numbers.

2966
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:21,020
No elephant.

2967
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:22,260
No.

2968
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:23,280
Okay.

2969
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:25,320
So if that's like 2...

2970
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,060
3...

2971
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:27,840
Oh, what?

2972
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:31,820
How do I get to 4 from that?

2973
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:35,560
What?

2974
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:39,680
I'm so confused.

2975
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:44,880
Wait, hold on.

2976
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:45,980
Can I take the numbers back?

2977
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:46,820
No, no.

2978
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,640
Let me take them back.

2979
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:48,180
Wait.

2980
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:48,620
Oh, no.

2981
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:50,260
Oh, dog.

2982
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:56,630
So it's like 2...

2983
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:58,230
No.

2984
02:00:59,090 --> 02:00:59,610
3...

2985
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:00,790
4...

2986
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:02,990
Then 5...

2987
02:01:02,990 --> 02:01:04,690
Then 5...

2988
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:06,810
6...

2989
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:07,430
Oh, no.

2990
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,050
I can't reach.

2991
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:09,790
Oh, wait.

2992
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:10,650
Uh...

2993
02:01:10,650 --> 02:01:10,910
5...

2994
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:11,990
Oh, my gosh.

2995
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:14,190
It's just placing more numbers for me.

2996
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:15,110
Please.

2997
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:18,350
No.

2998
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:19,170
Oh, gosh.

2999
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:19,810
I can't...

3000
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:21,090
I can't get rid of the numbers.

3001
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:21,970
Please.

3002
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:22,910
Get rid of the...

3003
02:01:22,910 --> 02:01:23,070
Okay.

3004
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:23,530
There we go.

3005
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:23,830
There we go.

3006
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:24,030
Okay.

3007
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:24,810
There we go.

3008
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:25,050
Okay.

3009
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,770
Because it was confusing me so much.

3010
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:27,410
Okay.

3011
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:28,530
9...

3012
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:32,770
10...

3013
02:01:33,810 --> 02:01:34,210
What?

3014
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:35,810
How am I supposed to get there?

3015
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:39,150
How?

3016
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:44,770
Top right corner is 9.

3017
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:45,170
Okay.

3018
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:47,190
9...

3019
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:47,930
10...

3020
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:48,550
11...

3021
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:49,410
12...

3022
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:49,950
13...

3023
02:01:49,950 --> 02:01:50,810
14...

3024
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:53,710
15...

3025
02:01:53,710 --> 02:01:54,750
16...

3026
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:55,870
17...

3027
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:56,470
18...

3028
02:01:56,470 --> 02:01:57,730
Oh, this is not so bad, actually.

3029
02:01:58,870 --> 02:01:59,590
Uh...

3030
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:01,270
19...

3031
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:02,010
Uh...

3032
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:03,090
This isn't so bad, actually.

3033
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:05,650
20...

3034
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:07,170
Or 21 could go either way.

3035
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:10,870
We'll go 20...

3036
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:12,770
21...

3037
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:14,230
20...

3038
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:15,510
20...

3039
02:02:17,470 --> 02:02:18,430
23...

3040
02:02:18,430 --> 02:02:19,370
24...

3041
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:20,530
25...

3042
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:22,150
26...

3043
02:02:22,150 --> 02:02:22,830
27...

3044
02:02:22,830 --> 02:02:23,650
28...

3045
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:24,130
Ah, ah.

3046
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:24,910
I gotta move.

3047
02:02:25,230 --> 02:02:25,850
Okay, hold on.

3048
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:28,710
I gotta move.

3049
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:29,230
20...

3050
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:29,390
Okay.

3051
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:31,110
19...

3052
02:02:31,110 --> 02:02:31,670
20...

3053
02:02:31,670 --> 02:02:31,810
Here.

3054
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,990
Okay.

3055
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:34,510
29...

3056
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:35,010
30...

3057
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:38,370
31...

3058
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:40,090
32...

3059
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:40,490
33...

3060
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:40,890
34...

3061
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:41,370
35...

3062
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:42,490
36...

3063
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:42,910
37...

3064
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:43,390
38...

3065
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:44,470
39...

3066
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:45,010
40...

3067
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:45,490
41...

3068
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:46,370
42...

3069
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:47,170
43...

3070
02:02:47,170 --> 02:02:47,830
40...

3071
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:48,550
Oh, wait.

3072
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:49,190
Oh, oh.

3073
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:52,830
42...

3074
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:53,670
43...

3075
02:02:54,150 --> 02:02:54,630
44...

3076
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:55,890
45...

3077
02:02:55,890 --> 02:02:56,510
46...

3078
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:57,270
47...

3079
02:02:58,050 --> 02:02:58,530
48...

3080
02:03:01,370 --> 02:03:01,850
49...

3081
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:02,490
50...

3082
02:03:02,490 --> 02:03:03,010
51...

3083
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:03,370
52...

3084
02:03:03,370 --> 02:03:03,930
53...

3085
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:04,590
54...

3086
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:04,790
55...

3087
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:05,410
I did it!

3088
02:03:05,530 --> 02:03:06,070
I did it!

3089
02:03:09,210 --> 02:03:10,110
I did it!

3090
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:13,150
Wow.

3091
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:15,390
It's not as bad as that.

3092
02:03:15,390 --> 02:03:16,670
Not at all as I thought it would be.

3093
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,440
That wasn't as bad as at all that I thought it would be.

3094
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,260
Okay, let's walk around a little bit.

3095
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:26,200
Wait, what if I tell them about the...

3096
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:26,560
Hello?

3097
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,840
I finished up the Renograms puzzle.

3098
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:30,860
That's actually kind of fun.

3099
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:31,660
I knew you would.

3100
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:32,480
It, like, moved...

3101
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,380
Don't tell the other puzzles, but this is my favorite.

3102
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:36,080
Hey, hey, hey.

3103
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,740
Now, let's not get like that.

3104
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:38,720
I...

3105
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:38,860
I...

3106
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:41,600
It actually is, like, kind of fast-paced, so it's fun.

3107
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:43,900
Uh...

3108
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,560
I finished another Renograms puzzle.

3109
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:46,540
Here you go.

3110
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:47,420
Thank you.

3111
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:50,040
I finished the Sudoku puzzle.

3112
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:51,160
Here you go.

3113
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:51,660
Thank you.

3114
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:53,360
Maybe...

3115
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:54,920
I'll let you get back to work.

3116
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:55,060
Maybe now.

3117
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:55,540
Bye.

3118
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:24,090
Maybe do some pachinko.

3119
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:25,970
I guess so.

3120
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:30,990
That's what the guide told me to do, was to do pachinko or whatever until time.

3121
02:04:30,990 --> 02:04:32,130
I need to translate that.

3122
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:33,050
No, we don't.

3123
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:40,240
I wish I wasn't, like...

3124
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:42,380
Stuck in the will of the game.

3125
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:43,860
Like, I'm waiting on the game.

3126
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:46,140
I wish that I could just, you know...

3127
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,480
I wish I could do it.

3128
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:51,940
I know what I need to do.

3129
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:52,820
Please, game.

3130
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:53,760
Let me do it.

3131
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:55,380
Let me do it.

3132
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:56,700
It's okay.

3133
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:58,760
We'll just get some of the cool prizes, I suppose.

3134
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,920
We still have Nonograms.

3135
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,120
Yeah, but I don't want to get all Nonogrammed out.

3136
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:13,580
I feel like this will be faster to move time, I suppose.

3137
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:14,840
You know what I mean?

3138
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:20,220
I don't want to get Nonogrammed out before the big Nonogram that we have to do.

3139
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:32,850
Pick weddings.

3140
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:33,510
Never mind.

3141
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:37,250
Don't tell the other puzzles.

3142
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:38,410
This one's my favorite.

3143
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:40,690
From a guy visiting his girlfriend's place.

3144
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:44,850
You mean girlfriend's sister's place.

3145
02:05:47,930 --> 02:05:50,190
His girlfriend's sister's place.

3146
02:05:53,410 --> 02:05:54,390
Bing, bing.

3147
02:05:58,070 --> 02:06:02,370
I would do the Nonogram, but we're on the 15x15 now, you guys.

3148
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:08,270
We're on the 15x15, and I've never done that one before.

3149
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:09,090
It'll take a while.

3150
02:06:09,550 --> 02:06:11,670
I want to save it for...

3151
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:14,110
And we have to do it for the Paizo.

3152
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:18,110
Lirion!

3153
02:06:18,330 --> 02:06:19,010
Welcome to Mumble Shop.

3154
02:06:19,170 --> 02:06:19,570
Thank you!

3155
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:23,110
Does he know it's his sister?

3156
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:24,230
It's her sister?

3157
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:25,150
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3158
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:27,570
A hundred percent, he knows.

3159
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:31,010
Bing, bing.

3160
02:06:36,450 --> 02:06:38,990
Have you played the Pachinko IRL besides the Metal Gear Solid?

3161
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:39,890
I have!

3162
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:42,010
But not like at a...

3163
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:43,270
Not like at a...

3164
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:45,150
Pachinko parlor or anything.

3165
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:47,910
Um, sometimes, you know, like conventions...

3166
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:49,610
People will bring some...

3167
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:51,670
Like, their own machines or whatever.

3168
02:06:52,090 --> 02:06:55,170
And at one that I went to, someone brought a Pachinko machine.

3169
02:06:56,570 --> 02:06:58,610
So I was at least able to try it.

3170
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:01,910
And it was very, like...

3171
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:02,550
Underwhelming.

3172
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:05,550
But I...

3173
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:06,530
I...

3174
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:08,290
Thought about maybe...

3175
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:09,070
Getting one.

3176
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:12,450
Like, I saw one for an anime series...

3177
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:13,750
That I was just like, wait...

3178
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:15,830
I kind of want this, because I like the anime.

3179
02:07:18,610 --> 02:07:19,410
Bing, bing, bing.

3180
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:21,010
Wow, we made a lot of money this time.

3181
02:07:21,010 --> 02:07:22,270
Oh, oh, oh!

3182
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:24,430
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

3183
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:30,380
Hello?

3184
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,780
What's going on?

3185
02:07:38,450 --> 02:07:38,850
Creepy.

3186
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:40,190
What is this?

3187
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:41,770
Oh my gosh, 3,000!

3188
02:07:42,470 --> 02:07:43,590
How many do we have?

3189
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:45,790
That might be the most expensive one.

3190
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:46,450
We have 1,800.

3191
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:47,990
We can totally get the...

3192
02:07:47,990 --> 02:07:49,230
We can get the 3,000.

3193
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:55,030
Okay, progress is happening, maybe.

3194
02:07:57,650 --> 02:08:00,450
There is a progression of the story, maybe?

3195
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:21,410
One of those was 4,600.

3196
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:22,230
Wait, which one?

3197
02:08:22,510 --> 02:08:23,590
I didn't see 4,000.

3198
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:27,030
I only saw the 3,000 one.

3199
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:28,250
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

3200
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:28,910
Do-do-do-do-do.

3201
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:35,710
Ah, I wish someone would stop creepily calling my phone.

3202
02:08:36,830 --> 02:08:37,930
Hi, Nancy.

3203
02:08:37,970 --> 02:08:39,350
You have a cell phone.

3204
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:42,950
You can just call the number back and see what happens.

3205
02:08:45,170 --> 02:08:47,130
I bet Ren-Taro would pick up.

3206
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:49,690
Oh, it's Geta.

3207
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:50,810
I didn't see those.

3208
02:08:53,190 --> 02:08:53,610
Nice.

3209
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:57,170
What time is it even?

3210
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:00,490
It's only...

3211
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:01,130
It's not even 8.

3212
02:09:03,650 --> 02:09:05,290
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

3213
02:09:10,550 --> 02:09:14,130
Guys, this is the riveting gameplay that we hoped for.

3214
02:09:17,270 --> 02:09:20,930
This is the riveting Nancy Drew puzzle game.

3215
02:09:21,410 --> 02:09:22,270
I'll be honest.

3216
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:25,850
When I played this, or when I was just like, I'm going to play the Nancy Drew game.

3217
02:09:26,630 --> 02:09:28,550
I thought it was a hidden object game.

3218
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:33,730
I was like, oh, I'm really in the mood to play a hidden object game right now.

3219
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:35,950
I thought it was that kind of game.

3220
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:40,450
I was so wrong.

3221
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:43,650
Hidden object games are so fun.

3222
02:09:43,770 --> 02:09:44,250
I know.

3223
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:47,030
I was really just in the mood to play one.

3224
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:59,200
There's a hidden trigger for the pics behind this time that I haven't been watching enough to know if Minto did.

3225
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:01,760
Well, what is it?

3226
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:05,000
Don't hold out on us, Jacob.

3227
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:06,160
What's the hidden trigger?

3228
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:09,340
Where's the MGS Pachinko?

3229
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:10,540
It's not Pachinko.

3230
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:11,600
It's Pachislot.

3231
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:13,780
The secret bath?

3232
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,920
Oh yeah, we did that.

3233
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3234
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:17,720
We went there.

3235
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:18,340
We went there.

3236
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:21,860
Holy cow!

3237
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:22,240
Oh no!

3238
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:24,840
Is this our...

3239
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:25,420
Is this it?

3240
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:27,100
Yeah!

3241
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:28,820
Okay.

3242
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:29,660
We got it.

3243
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:32,700
And we're at the Purikura to even...

3244
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:32,880
Oops.

3245
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:34,500
Okay.

3246
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:37,700
Which one was it?

3247
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:39,260
This one?

3248
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:40,320
Oh shoot.

3249
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:40,760
I don't know.

3250
02:10:41,220 --> 02:10:41,520
Wait.

3251
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:42,420
Hold on.

3252
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,160
I have to look at my inventory.

3253
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:44,860
Okay.

3254
02:10:44,860 --> 02:10:46,000
We have the sunglasses one.

3255
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:49,140
We have this one.

3256
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:51,100
We have this one.

3257
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:51,980
We have this one.

3258
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:52,620
We have this one.

3259
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:53,960
We have this one.

3260
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:54,140
Okay.

3261
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:54,860
So it's just this one.

3262
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:55,560
Okay.

3263
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:58,580
All right.

3264
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:00,620
Now, Nancy.

3265
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:02,720
Oh!

3266
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:03,080
Oh!

3267
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:03,900
It's letting me do it!

3268
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:04,120
Okay.

3269
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:04,320
Okay.

3270
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:04,680
Perfect.

3271
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:04,840
Perfect.

3272
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:06,500
Okay.

3273
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:10,040
Uh, let's see.

3274
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:17,000
Oh, this don't line up back.

3275
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:25,310
Oh, wait, this is, this is... Maybe if I put them in the middle.

3276
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:27,870
They have nothing on the other side of them.

3277
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:29,870
Uh, this is to that.

3278
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:32,130
Okay.

3279
02:11:36,670 --> 02:11:38,150
Which one also goes to five?

3280
02:11:40,050 --> 02:11:41,130
This goes to two.

3281
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:45,010
I'm just throwing them everywhere.

3282
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:48,730
There's no rhyme or reason here.

3283
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:51,870
There's no rhyme or reason.

3284
02:11:52,090 --> 02:11:52,710
Oh, two.

3285
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:56,010
Okay.

3286
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:05,080
There's a hidden message.

3287
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:07,460
I need to talk to Yumi about this.

3288
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:18,720
Oh, it's, it's the, it's, oh my gosh, it's the numbers for her, um, it's the numbers for her, uh, Oh my gosh, I feel like we could have brute forced this.

3289
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:21,700
For the thing in her room.

3290
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:23,340
Okay, okay, okay.

3291
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,780
Yes, the frog!

3292
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:28,620
The frog, the frog!

3293
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:30,280
The frog, the frog!

3294
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:30,840
Okay.

3295
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:31,960
Okay.

3296
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:38,040
Let me out.

3297
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:43,900
Guys, can you remember the number?

3298
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,740
Wait, we had it.

3299
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:45,460
No, I have it.

3300
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:47,620
Uh, her place is...

3301
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:48,820
...Kurume.

3302
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:50,680
...Kurume.

3303
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:51,020
...The frog.

3304
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:53,620
The frog.

3305
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:54,620
If you kanji, I can't read.

3306
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:55,160
It's okay.

3307
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:56,580
We got you.

3308
02:12:56,620 --> 02:12:57,240
They're just numbers.

3309
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:58,780
They're just numbers.

3310
02:12:59,460 --> 02:12:59,860
They're just numbers.

3311
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:01,160
Hello, let me in.

3312
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:03,940
I don't need to talk to Yumi about this at all.

3313
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:05,620
I need to talk to Yumi first.

3314
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:06,020
Why?

3315
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,560
No, I don't.

3316
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:12,220
Six...

3317
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:14,820
Five...

3318
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:15,680
Wait, what was it?

3319
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:18,340
Six, nine...

3320
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:21,620
Uh...

3321
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:22,640
Two, five.

3322
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:24,540
I'm sequence breaking.

3323
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:29,670
Please, let me in.

3324
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:32,470
I can't believe it.

3325
02:13:33,010 --> 02:13:33,950
This, this...

3326
02:13:33,950 --> 02:13:34,590
I...

3327
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:35,430
I...

3328
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:38,330
I'm being shamed for knowing the hongol!

3329
02:13:38,630 --> 02:13:39,150
Hahaha!

3330
02:13:40,930 --> 02:13:42,430
I'm being shamed!

3331
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:46,490
I can't believe this.

3332
02:13:46,630 --> 02:13:48,310
Why do we have to talk to Yumi?

3333
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:49,230
Oh, no!

3334
02:13:51,710 --> 02:13:52,310
Please!

3335
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:54,150
Hello!

3336
02:13:55,310 --> 02:13:58,890
There's a hidden message in all those pictures you sent, isn't there?

3337
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:00,070
What do you mean?

3338
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:02,750
All of these pictures together show a set of numbers...

3339
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:02,990
I don't know what you mean.

3340
02:14:03,570 --> 02:14:03,670
Yeah.

3341
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:05,910
This can't just be a coincidence.

3342
02:14:06,290 --> 02:14:08,490
You're trying to tell me something, aren't you?

3343
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:10,290
You're sure they mean something?

3344
02:14:10,810 --> 02:14:13,650
Maybe you've been spending a little too much time at the Ryokan.

3345
02:14:14,030 --> 02:14:14,830
I'm positive.

3346
02:14:15,370 --> 02:14:15,890
You're right.

3347
02:14:16,210 --> 02:14:17,150
Nice job, Nancy.

3348
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:19,390
Oh, she was gaslighting me.

3349
02:14:19,390 --> 02:14:20,470
Why not just ask me?

3350
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:22,330
I know you want to help, Nancy.

3351
02:14:22,730 --> 02:14:24,030
But that doesn't mean you can help.

3352
02:14:24,650 --> 02:14:27,450
If you could break this code, I knew you could help me.

3353
02:14:27,590 --> 02:14:28,110
And you did.

3354
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:29,890
But what do these numbers mean?

3355
02:14:30,370 --> 02:14:31,250
You mean the numbers!

3356
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:33,170
Take a good look around.

3357
02:14:33,450 --> 02:14:35,670
Think about situations where numbers come in handy.

3358
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:37,530
Can you tell me a little bit more?

3359
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:40,430
I would, but I'm falling way behind as it is.

3360
02:14:40,610 --> 02:14:41,470
I need your help.

3361
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:42,050
Come on!

3362
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:43,350
Oh, no.

3363
02:14:43,690 --> 02:14:44,090
No, no.

3364
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:44,830
No, no, no.

3365
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:48,450
Guys, this is inescapable.

3366
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:54,030
Guys, they're forcing me.

3367
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:56,650
She's forcing me into labor.

3368
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,080
No way.

3369
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:06,140
Oh my god.

3370
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:11,520
She's forcing me.

3371
02:15:12,260 --> 02:15:13,560
This is...

3372
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:15,220
This is messed up, Yumi.

3373
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:17,360
This is messed up.

3374
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,340
Oh my gosh.

3375
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:20,620
You're a maid, aren't you?

3376
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:25,620
I just want to cast the spells.

3377
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:27,020
Okay.

3378
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:29,120
Alright.

3379
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,420
Alright, so bear, bear.

3380
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:33,180
Cat, rice, rice.

3381
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:42,140
Okay.

3382
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:46,700
Okay.

3383
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:53,040
No piggies at all.

3384
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:54,680
No piggy eggy is nothing.

3385
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:58,460
Can you imagine if they combined all four animals, though?

3386
02:15:58,900 --> 02:15:59,880
It would be...

3387
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:01,980
It would be chaos in this bento.

3388
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:03,380
That's a real...

3389
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:03,740
Nobody...

3390
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:05,000
It's such a pricey bento.

3391
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:06,240
Nobody pays for it.

3392
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:10,040
You think eggy bear in the middle?

3393
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:11,180
I don't know.

3394
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:12,440
What if it's sandwich bear?

3395
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,040
We don't know.

3396
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:14,860
We don't know yet.

3397
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:15,700
We don't know yet.

3398
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,700
We just know it's bear in the middle.

3399
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:26,020
But, I know for a fact that this is a rabbit rice.

3400
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:28,960
That is a rabbit rice.

3401
02:16:29,060 --> 02:16:29,600
A hundred percent.

3402
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:32,040
That one right there is rabbit rice.

3403
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,960
So, from there...

3404
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:38,920
Such confidence.

3405
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:39,760
Yeah.

3406
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:41,180
I am confident.

3407
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:43,400
A hundred percent rabbit rice.

3408
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:46,840
But...

3409
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:47,840
I don't know what's below it.

3410
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:51,900
We don't know if it's rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, this, or rabbit, rabbit, this yet.

3411
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:55,260
I'm still trying to figure out.

3412
02:16:57,820 --> 02:16:59,310
And then cat...

3413
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:02,380
I put the rabbit eggy.

3414
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:09,400
So then rabbit eggy is probably here.

3415
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:13,540
That's probably rabbit eggy.

3416
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:16,500
That must be a rabbit eggy.

3417
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,040
Then this is cat.

3418
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:20,720
Yes.

3419
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:21,440
Yes.

3420
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:22,120
Yes.

3421
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:23,600
Yes.

3422
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:26,730
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3423
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,380
Okay.

3424
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:31,480
And then cat.

3425
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:37,530
So I believe then...

3426
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:41,940
This is either the sandwich eggy...

3427
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:42,040
No.

3428
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:43,760
This is our sandwich eggy.

3429
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,360
So it's a bear sandwich.

3430
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:47,140
In the center.

3431
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:49,660
Because otherwise we can't do...

3432
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:50,860
Because this has to be rice.

3433
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:52,720
So this is a bear sandwich.

3434
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:59,100
This game keeps surprising me with how much content it actually...

3435
02:17:59,100 --> 02:17:59,800
I don't...

3436
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,260
Right?

3437
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:03,100
I can't believe we're on part three of this game.

3438
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:04,980
And I've already been streaming for two hours.

3439
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:09,360
Rabbit sandwich below rabbit rice.

3440
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:11,920
Well, hold your horses.

3441
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:14,560
Hold your horses because why...

3442
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,600
This could possibly be a bear something.

3443
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:17,620
This could...

3444
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:18,960
Because this is the sandwich, you know?

3445
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:20,700
We don't know quite yet.

3446
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:21,820
We don't know quite yet.

3447
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:23,640
Hold your horses.

3448
02:18:38,310 --> 02:18:38,910
Maybe...

3449
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:40,370
I'm thinking...

3450
02:18:40,370 --> 02:18:41,190
This...

3451
02:18:42,330 --> 02:18:42,930
Is...

3452
02:18:42,930 --> 02:18:44,430
This is a...

3453
02:18:44,730 --> 02:18:45,490
Cat rice.

3454
02:18:47,170 --> 02:18:48,590
And then this is cat.

3455
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:50,290
And then this is bear rice.

3456
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:52,250
Yeah.

3457
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:53,950
It has to be like that.

3458
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:56,430
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3459
02:18:56,990 --> 02:18:57,270
Yes.

3460
02:19:00,130 --> 02:19:01,790
So then that would be...

3461
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:03,470
Cat something here.

3462
02:19:03,810 --> 02:19:04,730
Cat eggy?

3463
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:06,450
Cat sandwich?

3464
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:08,870
We don't know yet.

3465
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:14,620
I think the triangle goes into the square hole.

3466
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,260
So then we have a bear down here.

3467
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:22,300
That's our final bear.

3468
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:27,680
But then also...

3469
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:28,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3470
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:28,740
Wait.

3471
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:29,260
Oh.

3472
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:30,660
Yeah, bear eggy.

3473
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:32,420
We'll have to be here.

3474
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,100
That's all we got left.

3475
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:35,940
That's all we got left.

3476
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:39,480
Okay, so we figured out this one.

3477
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:40,580
We're still...

3478
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:40,980
We don't...

3479
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:42,640
I don't quite know the placement of that one yet.

3480
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:45,340
Sandwich to egg.

3481
02:19:46,860 --> 02:19:48,120
Sandwich to egg.

3482
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:49,860
Could be...

3483
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:52,660
A cat eggy.

3484
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:56,800
Then this one's a cat sandwich.

3485
02:19:57,940 --> 02:19:59,600
Another order out the door.

3486
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,620
Nancy, great job.

3487
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:04,280
Araso, Nancy, bad news.

3488
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:05,540
What do you mean?

3489
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:07,640
I didn't notice how late it was getting.

3490
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:10,320
I sort of made you miss your last train back to the Ryokan.

3491
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:11,780
You're not mad, are you?

3492
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:12,300
Uh-oh.

3493
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:13,480
Oh!

3494
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:14,880
Wait, seriously?

3495
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:15,720
I've...

3496
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:16,980
Never had this happen.

3497
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:18,540
Um...

3498
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:19,780
Yes, I am.

3499
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:22,820
Yes, I am.

3500
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:23,260
Yeah!

3501
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:24,320
Oh, no!

3502
02:20:24,820 --> 02:20:25,600
Okay, don't worry.

3503
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:27,120
I think I have a solution.

3504
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:27,620
What's that?

3505
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:29,140
I want you to stay at my apartment tonight.

3506
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:30,680
I ought to stay at a friend's.

3507
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:34,180
I do this all of the time for Rantaro, so I'm not taking no on this one.

3508
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:38,700
Why is Rantaro sleeping at your apartment?

3509
02:20:43,490 --> 02:20:44,590
Excuse me?

3510
02:20:47,770 --> 02:20:48,970
Excuse me?

3511
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:51,630
Um...

3512
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:52,510
What if I just say thanks?

3513
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:57,230
Um...

3514
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:59,730
Does Rantaro have keys to your apartment?

3515
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:01,310
Because, uh...

3516
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:04,890
But also, if I miss the last train...

3517
02:21:04,890 --> 02:21:05,750
Does...

3518
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:07,690
I have to take the train to get to your place, too.

3519
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:11,230
Um...

3520
02:21:11,950 --> 02:21:13,830
Let's just say thanks, I guess.

3521
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:15,590
Thanks.

3522
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:18,130
Yeah, we gotta go check the frog safe.

3523
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:23,220
What was it?

3524
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:24,900
Uh...

3525
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:26,120
I don't remember.

3526
02:21:28,380 --> 02:21:29,500
It was...

3527
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:32,280
6, 9, 2, 5.

3528
02:21:40,170 --> 02:21:40,910
Oh, uh.

3529
02:21:42,610 --> 02:21:45,670
These look like the numbers for one of Rantaro's monogram puzzles.

3530
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:47,310
We got the other ones!

3531
02:21:48,010 --> 02:21:48,490
Alright.

3532
02:21:48,910 --> 02:21:49,790
What time is it?

3533
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:50,650
12 a.m.

3534
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:52,470
Um...

3535
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:53,170
I guess we'll sleep?

3536
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:55,850
I guess we wake up at...

3537
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:56,690
7 p.m.?

3538
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:03,220
Okay.

3539
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,620
Now we can go do that one in the...

3540
02:22:07,380 --> 02:22:08,500
In the...

3541
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:09,620
Uh...

3542
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:16,730
Uh...

3543
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:19,670
Uh...

3544
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:39,600
Uh...

3545
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:41,180
Love to your family.

3546
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,260
Can't wait to see you again.

3547
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:44,020
Yumi, I know your secret!

3548
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:46,380
I can't wait to see you again!

3549
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:49,040
Wee-hoo!

3550
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:50,400
What's going on?

3551
02:22:50,620 --> 02:22:51,840
What was that?

3552
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:54,940
What is Yumi's secret?

3553
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:01,550
What could it be?

3554
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:10,620
I think we gotta talk to Yumi.

3555
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:14,700
I think Yumi's got some splainin' to do.

3556
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:20,680
Oh my god.

3557
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:22,620
Why won't anyone give me a straight answer?

3558
02:23:23,380 --> 02:23:26,600
Why won't anyone give me a straight answer about what happened to Kasumi?

3559
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:30,080
You think you're entitled to a straight answer about my life?

3560
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:31,080
My mother's life?

3561
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:32,700
Who are you, Nancy?

3562
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:34,380
A stranger.

3563
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:34,880
Yes!

3564
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:35,500
Tell her!

3565
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:36,780
You forget that too easily.

3566
02:23:36,820 --> 02:23:37,920
You tell her, Miwako.

3567
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:40,220
You put Nancy Drew in her place!

3568
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:43,860
God damn, Nancy!

3569
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:47,340
Why won't anyone tell me their personal stories?

3570
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:50,420
Why won't anyone share with me their trauma?

3571
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:52,320
Like...

3572
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:52,480
Hey!

3573
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:55,420
I'll let you get back to work.

3574
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:56,540
Catch you around!

3575
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:57,780
Someone said it finally.

3576
02:23:57,940 --> 02:23:58,600
For real!

3577
02:23:58,920 --> 02:23:59,360
Nancy!

3578
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:00,500
God!

3579
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,080
Nancy was stunned into silence.

3580
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:04,440
She didn't even say anything back.

3581
02:24:08,610 --> 02:24:10,230
Hello, Nancy-san.

3582
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:13,450
Did you want to run the Ryokan when you were a girl?

3583
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:14,270
No.

3584
02:24:14,470 --> 02:24:15,810
She's a drama vampire.

3585
02:24:16,510 --> 02:24:17,810
I wanted to travel.

3586
02:24:18,330 --> 02:24:19,110
What happened?

3587
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:22,670
I fell in love with the Ryokan.

3588
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:24,050
The guests.

3589
02:24:24,390 --> 02:24:25,510
The seasons.

3590
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:26,350
The seasons.

3591
02:24:26,550 --> 02:24:29,570
I realized that I wanted to take care of it.

3592
02:24:29,570 --> 02:24:34,130
I wanted my daughters to have the chance to know it here.

3593
02:24:34,370 --> 02:24:35,030
Daughters?

3594
02:24:35,410 --> 02:24:36,830
Kasumi had a sister?

3595
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:37,830
No.

3596
02:24:38,350 --> 02:24:39,610
I don't understand.

3597
02:24:40,370 --> 02:24:41,110
My youngest.

3598
02:24:41,410 --> 02:24:44,550
She met some man from overseas.

3599
02:24:44,990 --> 02:24:46,990
She never has visited.

3600
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:48,950
Says it's too far.

3601
02:24:49,570 --> 02:24:50,710
Wants me to visit.

3602
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:53,670
She knows I can't leave here.

3603
02:24:54,470 --> 02:24:58,330
She did not even come home for the funeral.

3604
02:24:58,750 --> 02:24:59,190
What?

3605
02:24:59,330 --> 02:25:00,150
That's so sad.

3606
02:25:03,710 --> 02:25:04,510
Okay.

3607
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:06,750
I'll stop bugging you now.

3608
02:25:07,170 --> 02:25:09,550
Please visit again, Nancy-san.

3609
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:11,650
Was she disowned?

3610
02:25:12,050 --> 02:25:12,730
Or...

3611
02:25:12,730 --> 02:25:14,510
Is that the Marianne person?

3612
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:16,550
What?

3613
02:25:16,910 --> 02:25:19,330
Did she adopt like a foreign name?

3614
02:25:19,330 --> 02:25:21,350
You know how some people do that?

3615
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:22,430
Alright.

3616
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:25,530
I'm debating if I want to go talk to Yumi.

3617
02:25:26,130 --> 02:25:26,610
Or...

3618
02:25:26,610 --> 02:25:27,470
Do the nonogram.

3619
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:30,710
I think we could do the nonogram at night.

3620
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:32,490
So let's go talk to Yumi instead.

3621
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:39,430
This family.

3622
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:40,510
I know for real.

3623
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:41,350
They got some drama.

3624
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:45,670
Wait.

3625
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:53,510
Okay.

3626
02:25:55,210 --> 02:25:55,690
Yumi.

3627
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:58,090
Someone tried to break and enter into your home last night.

3628
02:25:58,790 --> 02:25:59,770
What's going on?

3629
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:04,530
I think someone was outside your apartment trying to scare you last night.

3630
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:05,650
What do you mean?

3631
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:09,630
I woke up in the middle of the night and there was this weird writing on the window.

3632
02:26:09,770 --> 02:26:12,610
And it said, I know your secret, Yumi.

3633
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:14,450
See you again soon.

3634
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:16,790
That's not funny, Nancy.

3635
02:26:17,130 --> 02:26:18,510
I wasn't trying to be funny.

3636
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:19,310
It's true.

3637
02:26:19,410 --> 02:26:20,170
That's not funny.

3638
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:22,550
That was written on my window in my apartment.

3639
02:26:22,790 --> 02:26:23,790
You're not lying?

3640
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:24,670
I'm not.

3641
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:25,470
That's not funny, Nancy.

3642
02:26:25,470 --> 02:26:25,950
You swear?

3643
02:26:26,390 --> 02:26:27,570
I promise you.

3644
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:27,930
Yeah, in English.

3645
02:26:28,230 --> 02:26:28,730
What does it mean?

3646
02:26:29,330 --> 02:26:30,290
It means...

3647
02:26:30,290 --> 02:26:32,370
It means my grandmother is right.

3648
02:26:32,630 --> 02:26:33,790
What was she right about?

3649
02:26:34,290 --> 02:26:35,810
Nancy, don't go back to the ryokan.

3650
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:36,670
Just...

3651
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:37,790
Just go home, okay?

3652
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:39,590
Find your friends and go home.

3653
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:40,130
I agree.

3654
02:26:46,150 --> 02:26:47,710
Time to go back to the ryokan.

3655
02:26:50,590 --> 02:26:51,370
I'm

3656
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:55,880
not funny, Nancy.

3657
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:56,860
You should...

3658
02:26:58,700 --> 02:27:00,260
Oh, golly.

3659
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:02,360
Golly goodness me.

3660
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:03,040
Okay.

3661
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,400
Time to be a snoop again.

3662
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:12,500
This place has the most lax security ever.

3663
02:27:16,460 --> 02:27:17,640
Is it this one?

3664
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:19,080
Yeah.

3665
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:22,600
Press the bird.

3666
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:24,280
Oh, just kidding.

3667
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:28,000
The music stopping is so unnerving.

3668
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:31,000
Okay, I've got to save.

3669
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:34,440
Just in case this is timed for whatever.

3670
02:27:34,580 --> 02:27:35,320
It shouldn't be.

3671
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:37,420
There's no way this is timed.

3672
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:38,520
Holy cow.

3673
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:41,740
Okay, I've never done a 15 by 15 one before.

3674
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:42,240
This is...

3675
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:43,680
15, 20.

3676
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:44,460
Oh, never mind!

3677
02:27:44,460 --> 02:27:46,840
Wait, 5, 10, 15, 20...

3678
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:48,340
25 by 25!

3679
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:50,720
Wait, I've never done anyone this big before.

3680
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:51,580
Okay.

3681
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:52,300
Oh.

3682
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:55,000
Oh my gosh.

3683
02:27:55,360 --> 02:27:55,560
Okay.

3684
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:57,820
This is gonna take me a minute.

3685
02:27:58,840 --> 02:27:59,400
P-cross?

3686
02:27:59,660 --> 02:27:59,880
Yeah.

3687
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:02,880
But like huge P-cross.

3688
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:04,200
Holy cow.

3689
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:06,000
Oh my god.

3690
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:06,940
Okay.

3691
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:12,480
Are these all...

3692
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:14,420
These are already put in, so they're correct, right?

3693
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:16,580
Oh, that's nice.

3694
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:17,140
Okay, cool.

3695
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:25,040
So 5, 10, 15, 20.

3696
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:29,520
Wait.

3697
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:30,360
Is that...

3698
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:30,480
Yeah.

3699
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,200
1, 2, 3.

3700
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:32,040
4, 5, 6.

3701
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:33,020
7, 8, 9.

3702
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:33,960
10, 11, 12.

3703
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:34,860
30, 40, 15.

3704
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:36,240
60, 70, 18.

3705
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:36,960
19, 20.

3706
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:37,780
Yes.

3707
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:38,620
That's good.

3708
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:39,100
That's good.

3709
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,820
Okay, then 3.

3710
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:43,720
That.

3711
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:44,960
Uh.

3712
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:46,420
That.

3713
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:50,200
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3714
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:51,740
Uh.

3715
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:52,840
This should...

3716
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:53,200
Oh, whoops.

3717
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:53,740
That.

3718
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:54,300
That.

3719
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:57,940
2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

3720
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:05,700
Now I'm in my element.

3721
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:09,160
I'm in my element.

3722
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:12,020
That 2 mark you put in the bottom right might be wrong.

3723
02:29:12,860 --> 02:29:13,920
No, I don't think so.

3724
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:19,740
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

3725
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:21,420
I might be wrong.

3726
02:29:21,580 --> 02:29:21,940
Who knows?

3727
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:24,380
Like I said, I've never done one this large before.

3728
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:26,020
It's humongous.

3729
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:27,860
No, I lied?

3730
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:28,140
Oh.

3731
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:30,620
Liar.

3732
02:29:31,880 --> 02:29:32,680
Let's see.

3733
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:44,640
Okay, so this is the 3 here.

3734
02:29:44,940 --> 02:29:45,700
Like that.

3735
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:46,060
Okay.

3736
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:47,380
So then...

3737
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:48,460
Oh, it's 5 and then 11.

3738
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:49,060
It's still...

3739
02:29:49,060 --> 02:29:49,500
It's still...

3740
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:50,120
Oh, this...

3741
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:50,680
Actually...

3742
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:52,740
5, 10, 11.

3743
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:53,260
Oh.

3744
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:54,720
Like that.

3745
02:29:55,860 --> 02:29:56,380
Okay.

3746
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:58,060
Oh.

3747
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:00,500
5, 6, 7, 8.

3748
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:02,060
8.

3749
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:03,420
Okay, like that.

3750
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:11,340
She's talking about me.

3751
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:12,020
What do you mean?

3752
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:12,840
What?

3753
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:13,380
A liar?

3754
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,160
No.

3755
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:15,320
No.

3756
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:16,840
5, 6, 7, 8.

3757
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:21,940
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

3758
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:23,540
You're not a liar, are you?

3759
02:30:26,140 --> 02:30:26,540
Okay.

3760
02:30:27,940 --> 02:30:30,020
This one is so ginormous.

3761
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:31,620
My brain is hurting.

3762
02:30:32,220 --> 02:30:33,220
Okay, so 2...

3763
02:30:33,220 --> 02:30:34,840
If this is 2, then this is 1.

3764
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:36,560
And then 1, 2, 3.

3765
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:38,920
1, 2, 3, 4.

3766
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:42,400
Which means this is 2.

3767
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:46,740
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

3768
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:49,700
I'm on the right one, right?

3769
02:30:49,980 --> 02:30:50,340
Okay, good.

3770
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:58,200
I came back for a bit.

3771
02:30:58,520 --> 02:30:59,040
I left for a bit.

3772
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:00,340
I came back to 25 by 25.

3773
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:00,740
Yeah!

3774
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:02,320
Isn't it huge?

3775
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,040
It's so big.

3776
02:31:08,380 --> 02:31:09,260
Oh, wait.

3777
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:11,660
Then this one, we can also cross off all of this.

3778
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:13,260
Because it's 2, 1.

3779
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:14,200
Like so.

3780
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:24,520
3, 4, 5.

3781
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:27,800
So then this...

3782
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:28,120
Oh my gosh.

3783
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:28,600
My...

3784
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:29,620
I can't even like...

3785
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:30,960
It's so large.

3786
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,580
Like if I look up, I don't even know where I am.

3787
02:31:36,620 --> 02:31:37,020
2.

3788
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:38,300
Okay.

3789
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,640
So this one would also have to be the 2.

3790
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:45,060
And then the end is 2.

3791
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:46,520
Oh yeah, we did these 2 also.

3792
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:47,940
3, 3.

3793
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:51,320
2, 2, 2, 1.

3794
02:31:52,220 --> 02:31:53,180
So 9.

3795
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:54,080
2.

3796
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:54,580
Okay.

3797
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,040
We're doing it.

3798
02:31:57,380 --> 02:31:58,380
We're doing it.

3799
02:31:58,500 --> 02:31:58,940
We're doing it.

3800
02:31:58,980 --> 02:31:59,460
We're doing it.

3801
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:00,080
We're doing it.

3802
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:01,600
We're figuring it out.

3803
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:03,600
Little by little.

3804
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:05,440
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

3805
02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:09,440
This would be 4.

3806
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:12,040
Okay.

3807
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:12,700
Like that.

3808
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:15,940
Like that.

3809
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:17,980
Oop.

3810
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:20,860
Okay.

3811
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:23,340
We're figuring it out.

3812
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:24,380
Okay.

3813
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:25,740
And then 14.

3814
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:30,320
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

3815
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:30,840
Wait.

3816
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:31,160
Sorry.

3817
02:32:31,540 --> 02:32:31,960
1, 2, 3.

3818
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:33,280
4, 5, 6.

3819
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:35,200
7, 8, 9.

3820
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:36,240
10, 11.

3821
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:38,340
12, 13, 14.

3822
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:38,520
14.

3823
02:32:45,700 --> 02:32:46,180
Okay.

3824
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,120
Okay.

3825
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:49,640
Okay.

3826
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:51,220
This is 6.

3827
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:53,240
3, 4, 5, 6.

3828
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:54,260
All right.

3829
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:01,340
We can get rid of all of those.

3830
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:06,640
What's it making?

3831
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:07,680
Can you guys see anything?

3832
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:12,220
A mistake has been made.

3833
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:13,120
Uh-oh.

3834
02:33:16,510 --> 02:33:18,110
A mistake has been made.

3835
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:26,000
No.

3836
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:28,580
No.

3837
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:34,020
It's this.

3838
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:34,380
Oh.

3839
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:35,980
I think I read this as 2.

3840
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:37,060
Okay.

3841
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:37,320
Wait.

3842
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:39,080
This is actually supposed to be 7.

3843
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:40,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3844
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:41,600
Maybe.

3845
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:42,900
Maybe it's okay.

3846
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:44,740
Right?

3847
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:45,480
Oh my gosh.

3848
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:47,160
I think I was reading this one as 7.

3849
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:47,500
Okay.

3850
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:48,560
Okay.

3851
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:49,020
Wait, wait, wait.

3852
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:49,620
I think we're okay.

3853
02:33:52,380 --> 02:33:53,320
I think we're okay.

3854
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:55,040
For now.

3855
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:58,620
I think we're okay for now.

3856
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:01,840
It's Minesweeper.

3857
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:04,200
Isn't Minesweeper...

3858
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:05,460
Is Minesweeper or Picross?

3859
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:06,240
Actually, I don't know.

3860
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:09,940
If so, I would be killer at Minesweeper.

3861
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:11,560
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

3862
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:14,660
Imagine you're colorblind.

3863
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:15,600
No, not at all.

3864
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:16,080
Oh, okay.

3865
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:17,920
Then no, it's not Minesweeper.

3866
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:20,440
Okay.

3867
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:22,440
2, 2.

3868
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:23,780
2.

3869
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:36,100
It doesn't help that it looks like...

3870
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:39,580
I don't think they are, but it looks like some of these are not...

3871
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:42,060
Rather, it feels like some of them are not...

3872
02:34:42,060 --> 02:34:42,980
Like, it's not even.

3873
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:45,280
So, my brain is working overtime.

3874
02:34:52,950 --> 02:34:54,430
1, 3, 2.

3875
02:34:55,650 --> 02:34:56,890
And another 2.

3876
02:34:58,330 --> 02:34:59,530
And then...

3877
02:34:59,530 --> 02:35:00,890
1, 2, 3.

3878
02:35:01,150 --> 02:35:02,170
Can't do that yet.

3879
02:35:02,430 --> 02:35:02,610
3.

3880
02:35:03,450 --> 02:35:03,730
Okay.

3881
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:07,150
2, 2, 2, 3, 2.

3882
02:35:07,890 --> 02:35:09,470
6, 2, 2.

3883
02:35:10,110 --> 02:35:10,710
7.

3884
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:13,530
Alright, got that.

3885
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:14,650
2.

3886
02:35:16,310 --> 02:35:16,910
Okay.

3887
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:19,070
I could have figured that out anyway.

3888
02:35:19,390 --> 02:35:19,770
But that's fine.

3889
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:23,250
This is...

3890
02:35:23,250 --> 02:35:24,610
2.

3891
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:26,590
2.

3892
02:35:29,190 --> 02:35:30,190
4.

3893
02:35:32,170 --> 02:35:33,170
3.

3894
02:35:34,690 --> 02:35:35,230
Okay.

3895
02:35:35,810 --> 02:35:36,950
And this one's 3.

3896
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:38,410
But...

3897
02:35:38,410 --> 02:35:39,390
1, uh...

3898
02:35:39,390 --> 02:35:39,650
3.

3899
02:35:40,150 --> 02:35:40,930
Figured it out.

3900
02:35:45,710 --> 02:35:47,150
There's an art to Minesweeper.

3901
02:35:47,170 --> 02:35:49,750
It's like a reverse Minion nonogram every couple squares.

3902
02:35:52,050 --> 02:35:52,650
Um...

3903
02:35:52,650 --> 02:35:52,810
Yeah.

3904
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:54,410
I have no idea.

3905
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,670
Um...

3906
02:35:56,670 --> 02:35:56,970
I'm...

3907
02:35:56,970 --> 02:35:58,170
I'm only smart...

3908
02:35:59,730 --> 02:36:00,970
In one thing.

3909
02:36:01,850 --> 02:36:03,250
And that's sometimes nonograms.

3910
02:36:04,190 --> 02:36:04,270
Okay.

3911
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:12,430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

3912
02:36:13,250 --> 02:36:13,770
Boom.

3913
02:36:15,630 --> 02:36:17,150
Which means this one is a 3.

3914
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:18,850
And that's the 1.

3915
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:20,970
Like so.

3916
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:25,590
And then we can also do...

3917
02:36:26,450 --> 02:36:26,970
Um...

3918
02:36:26,970 --> 02:36:34,690
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

3919
02:36:36,370 --> 02:36:37,270
This is 7.

3920
02:36:38,930 --> 02:36:39,330
Perfect.

3921
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:39,890
Perfect.

3922
02:36:41,090 --> 02:36:41,410
Perfect.

3923
02:36:41,410 --> 02:36:41,670
Perfect.

3924
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:42,730
Perfect.

3925
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:42,930
Yeah.

3926
02:36:43,530 --> 02:36:43,930
Yeah.

3927
02:36:44,970 --> 02:36:45,370
Whoa.

3928
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:51,130
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

3929
02:37:10,670 --> 02:37:14,810
See, this is about the part when I would give up and come back to it like a couple hours later.

3930
02:37:19,550 --> 02:37:19,990
Uh...

3931
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:20,430
1.

3932
02:37:21,070 --> 02:37:21,510
Okay.

3933
02:37:21,990 --> 02:37:22,930
Which means...

3934
02:37:22,930 --> 02:37:24,250
Wait, where did I just place that 1?

3935
02:37:24,370 --> 02:37:24,550
Here?

3936
02:37:24,910 --> 02:37:31,250
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

3937
02:37:32,070 --> 02:37:32,450
Okay.

3938
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:33,250
Oh, I see.

3939
02:37:33,250 --> 02:37:34,550
I could have figured that one out anyway.

3940
02:37:36,050 --> 02:37:37,930
So this is also 1 here.

3941
02:37:39,930 --> 02:37:40,810
And we...

3942
02:37:40,810 --> 02:37:41,470
Uh...

3943
02:37:41,470 --> 02:37:41,750
Wait.

3944
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:42,910
Am I on the wrong row?

3945
02:37:44,810 --> 02:37:45,350
I'm on...

3946
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:45,490
Wait.

3947
02:37:46,570 --> 02:37:47,090
2...

3948
02:37:47,830 --> 02:37:48,350
Ah!

3949
02:37:48,570 --> 02:37:49,490
It's too big!

3950
02:37:49,770 --> 02:37:50,450
I can't see!

3951
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:54,150
2, 1, 5.

3952
02:37:56,230 --> 02:37:57,550
I think we can actually...

3953
02:37:57,550 --> 02:37:57,750
Hold on.

3954
02:37:57,870 --> 02:37:59,050
Let's see if we can finish this row.

3955
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:03,270
2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

3956
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:05,910
1, 2, 3, 4...

3957
02:38:05,910 --> 02:38:06,910
No, not quite.

3958
02:38:07,270 --> 02:38:09,150
But we can put in some...

3959
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:11,030
We can put in those.

3960
02:38:14,470 --> 02:38:15,730
3, 4, 5.

3961
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:21,160
Get a ruler.

3962
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:22,180
I know, right?

3963
02:38:24,400 --> 02:38:25,800
I actually need one.

3964
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:26,880
That's 6 there.

3965
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:30,400
Did we do 1, 2, 3...

3966
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:33,000
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

3967
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:33,600
Yes.

3968
02:38:35,020 --> 02:38:35,820
Yes, indeedy.

3969
02:38:36,020 --> 02:38:36,240
We did.

3970
02:38:36,400 --> 02:38:36,920
That's 2.

3971
02:38:37,820 --> 02:38:38,740
1, 2, 3, 4.

3972
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:39,100
Florm Club.

3973
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:44,300
Lazy Bug.

3974
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:45,740
Thank you so much for the...

3975
02:38:45,740 --> 02:38:46,740
Thank you.

3976
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:47,840
Thank you.

3977
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:48,040
Thank you.

3978
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:48,660
Welcome, guys.

3979
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:50,300
We're doing nonograms.

3980
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:52,280
Which is a little bit of my element.

3981
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:53,360
Wait.

3982
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:54,020
Why did I do that?

3983
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:54,540
Hold on.

3984
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:54,860
Wait.

3985
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:55,420
1, 2, 3.

3986
02:38:55,460 --> 02:38:55,660
Oh, yeah.

3987
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:56,240
Wait.

3988
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:57,080
Yeah.

3989
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:58,060
This has to be 4.

3990
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:00,980
And then this is 3.

3991
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:01,720
And this is 6.

3992
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:03,560
Boom.

3993
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:04,940
Column done.

3994
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:08,480
That's only our first column done.

3995
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:09,240
Oh, my gosh.

3996
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:12,820
Oh, my gosh.

3997
02:39:13,220 --> 02:39:13,700
Teacup.

3998
02:39:13,860 --> 02:39:15,500
Thank you for the gifted.

3999
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:16,380
Thank you.

4000
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:17,200
Thank you.

4001
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:17,460
Thank you.

4002
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:17,820
Thank you.

4003
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:25,860
1, 2, 3.

4004
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:26,940
4, 5, 6.

4005
02:39:27,140 --> 02:39:27,720
7, 8, 9.

4006
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:28,420
10.

4007
02:39:29,700 --> 02:39:30,180
1.

4008
02:39:31,060 --> 02:39:31,540
4.

4009
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:34,360
Which means this is...

4010
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:36,860
4.

4011
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:37,900
2.

4012
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:38,760
1.

4013
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:40,380
Got it.

4014
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:41,220
Joy Princess.

4015
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:42,320
Thank you so much for the gifted.

4016
02:39:42,340 --> 02:39:43,160
Thank you.

4017
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:46,640
Sorry she's taking so long, Raiders.

4018
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:47,340
What?

4019
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:49,460
How dare.

4020
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:49,960
Well, okay.

4021
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:50,400
Quack.

4022
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:51,060
You saw it.

4023
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:51,620
Go ahead.

4024
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:52,720
Go ahead.

4025
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:53,860
Go ahead.

4026
02:39:54,020 --> 02:39:55,640
In fact, I'll give you...

4027
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:57,120
I'll give you...

4028
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:58,460
Remote desktop.

4029
02:39:58,940 --> 02:39:59,440
Go ahead.

4030
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:00,440
Go ahead.

4031
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:01,460
Go ahead.

4032
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:02,440
Go ahead.

4033
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:03,360
Go ahead.

4034
02:40:04,500 --> 02:40:05,020
Valentine.

4035
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:06,000
Thanks for the vibe gifted.

4036
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:06,980
Thank you.

4037
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:10,280
I'll give you a remote desktop so that you can just finish it yourself.

4038
02:40:10,280 --> 02:40:10,480
12.

4039
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:11,160
Haha.

4040
02:40:20,730 --> 02:40:21,070
Wait.

4041
02:40:21,750 --> 02:40:22,490
Ah, uh...

4042
02:40:22,490 --> 02:40:22,850
There we go.

4043
02:40:23,830 --> 02:40:24,230
One.

4044
02:40:24,430 --> 02:40:24,610
Okay.

4045
02:40:24,690 --> 02:40:24,970
Sorry.

4046
02:40:25,130 --> 02:40:26,890
It's so easy to look at the wrong one here.

4047
02:40:29,210 --> 02:40:29,610
Hmm.

4048
02:40:29,890 --> 02:40:30,010
Hmm.

4049
02:40:30,430 --> 02:40:31,470
Is that a challenge?

4050
02:40:32,270 --> 02:40:34,110
I'm already solved most of it.

4051
02:40:34,210 --> 02:40:35,150
You would have to...

4052
02:40:35,150 --> 02:40:38,710
You would have to solve it not looking at my screen.

4053
02:40:39,330 --> 02:40:41,090
I've already solved like half of it.

4054
02:40:42,470 --> 02:40:48,430
Don't come in here being like, I solved it so much faster than you after I did most of the legwork.

4055
02:40:49,950 --> 02:40:51,410
Oh, thank you so much.

4056
02:40:51,550 --> 02:40:52,610
Wait, who gifted the 50?

4057
02:40:53,130 --> 02:40:53,990
Oh my god.

4058
02:40:54,170 --> 02:40:54,770
Thank you.

4059
02:40:56,090 --> 02:40:57,530
Lirio, thank you so much.

4060
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:58,390
Thank you, thank you.

4061
02:40:59,110 --> 02:41:01,510
Take as much time as possibly to spite him.

4062
02:41:02,710 --> 02:41:04,190
Actually though, I want to continue.

4063
02:41:04,970 --> 02:41:05,930
The story.

4064
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:09,290
That's two.

4065
02:41:12,430 --> 02:41:14,070
Which means this is two.

4066
02:41:14,830 --> 02:41:18,470
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

4067
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:20,030
All right, we got that.

4068
02:41:21,330 --> 02:41:24,110
It's all the little ones, you know?

4069
02:41:25,970 --> 02:41:26,490
Three.

4070
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:31,970
I wish I would cross out what I've done.

4071
02:41:31,970 --> 02:41:34,490
I wish I could cross out what I've done.

4072
02:41:34,830 --> 02:41:37,590
So I don't, so I don't repeat.

4073
02:41:37,990 --> 02:41:39,050
And I don't want to.

4074
02:41:41,230 --> 02:41:44,590
It's a portrait of Kasumi drowning.

4075
02:41:45,090 --> 02:41:47,550
Finally, we'll learn what happened to Kasumi.

4076
02:41:51,890 --> 02:41:53,230
Oh my gosh, finally.

4077
02:41:53,830 --> 02:41:56,030
Someone tells us what happened to Kasumi.

4078
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:00,850
That'd be insane.

4079
02:42:01,490 --> 02:42:03,410
Holy cow, that would be so insane.

4080
02:42:06,890 --> 02:42:08,610
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

4081
02:42:08,610 --> 02:42:09,730
One, one.

4082
02:42:14,530 --> 02:42:16,210
Liz, thank you so much for the 10, Captain.

4083
02:42:16,390 --> 02:42:16,990
Thank you.

4084
02:42:19,930 --> 02:42:23,510
Oh, okay.

4085
02:42:34,270 --> 02:42:36,110
So this is the two.

4086
02:42:37,170 --> 02:42:39,370
So we can get rid of all of this, actually.

4087
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:41,490
And then this is the three.

4088
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:44,430
Next column down, baby!

4089
02:42:44,910 --> 02:42:47,190
Gosh, this is taking...

4090
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:48,450
...forever!

4091
02:42:50,610 --> 02:42:51,730
This is so long.

4092
02:42:52,650 --> 02:42:53,650
And then this is three.

4093
02:42:53,990 --> 02:42:55,970
Yep, we could have deduced that.

4094
02:43:00,930 --> 02:43:04,390
If they can show that in 25 by 25 pixel art, I gotta give them props.

4095
02:43:04,570 --> 02:43:08,590
You'd be surprised what you can see in nonograms.

4096
02:43:08,630 --> 02:43:10,330
Like what little pictures they can make, you know?

4097
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:12,990
You'd be surprised.

4098
02:43:13,850 --> 02:43:15,570
All right, four, one.

4099
02:43:16,350 --> 02:43:18,290
Oh, I really wish I could cross these out.

4100
02:43:18,510 --> 02:43:21,050
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

4101
02:43:21,210 --> 02:43:22,190
Like Nancy, come on!

4102
02:43:27,380 --> 02:43:28,340
This was six.

4103
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:31,280
Another row completed!

4104
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:40,240
Which is two, five, four, four.

4105
02:43:40,620 --> 02:43:43,420
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right!

4106
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,520
Wait, which one was it, this one?

4107
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:51,560
This can't be three.

4108
02:43:52,160 --> 02:43:52,860
So get rid of that.

4109
02:43:56,450 --> 02:43:58,490
And this one looks like we could...

4110
02:43:59,290 --> 02:43:59,650
Two...

4111
02:44:01,650 --> 02:44:05,130
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

4112
02:44:05,770 --> 02:44:07,870
Wait, one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine!

4113
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:08,170
Yes!

4114
02:44:08,170 --> 02:44:08,650
Okay.

4115
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:11,970
Very good, very good, very good.

4116
02:44:12,030 --> 02:44:14,490
Slowly but surely, we are getting this.

4117
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:17,510
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

4118
02:44:17,770 --> 02:44:17,870
Okay.

4119
02:44:18,230 --> 02:44:19,170
Still can't do that one yet.

4120
02:44:19,930 --> 02:44:20,330
Potentially.

4121
02:44:21,030 --> 02:44:21,490
Sure, Doc.

4122
02:44:21,570 --> 02:44:23,890
I see Homer Simpson running from Katakana.

4123
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:38,260
That's 2 right there.

4124
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:42,560
4, 9.

4125
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:47,220
Okay.

4126
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:54,820
This is art.

4127
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:56,360
Right?

4128
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:00,880
This might not be 2.

4129
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:02,080
It could be part of the 6.

4130
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:04,300
So I'm not going to cross that out just yet.

4131
02:45:10,140 --> 02:45:12,400
3, 3, 2, 3.

4132
02:45:16,260 --> 02:45:16,540
Wait.

4133
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:16,840
Okay.

4134
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,460
So 2, 1.

4135
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:20,780
Okay.

4136
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:23,440
So we can get rid of these and get rid of that.

4137
02:45:23,620 --> 02:45:23,720
Okay.

4138
02:45:24,180 --> 02:45:26,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

4139
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:28,160
See, see, see, see, see here.

4140
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:28,860
See, see, see, see here.

4141
02:45:29,220 --> 02:45:30,560
And then, oh, oh, oh.

4142
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:31,100
This one too.

4143
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:31,760
3, 3.

4144
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:36,660
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 3.

4145
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:39,520
Another call I'm done.

4146
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:43,060
90% this isn't loss.

4147
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:44,740
Um, loss...

4148
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:47,440
Kind of matches the theme, not going to lie.

4149
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:52,680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

4150
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:52,980
Come on.

4151
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:58,700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

4152
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:04,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

4153
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:05,320
Wait.

4154
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:10,680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

4155
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:15,840
Okay.

4156
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:17,900
Not so devil!

4157
02:46:18,380 --> 02:46:19,260
Thank you for the five gifted.

4158
02:46:19,540 --> 02:46:20,160
Thank you!

4159
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:21,300
Thank you guys for all the gifted.

4160
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:22,080
Thank you so much.

4161
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:22,840
Thank you!

4162
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:24,360
Okay.

4163
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:24,420
Okay.

4164
02:46:31,180 --> 02:46:31,980
4.

4165
02:46:32,380 --> 02:46:33,540
What's the 4?

4166
02:46:33,780 --> 02:46:34,060
1.

4167
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:36,100
1?

4168
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:38,100
1.

4169
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:43,080
And then it's another 4.

4170
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:45,020
Like so.

4171
02:46:45,280 --> 02:46:45,960
And then 1.

4172
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:47,840
Another row completed.

4173
02:46:52,460 --> 02:46:53,880
I can't tell at all.

4174
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:56,300
I can't... I literally don't see anything in this photo.

4175
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:59,200
I don't... I don't see anything.

4176
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:04,440
I am... I am... Lost?

4177
02:47:04,440 --> 02:47:04,760
Lost?

4178
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:13,370
Oh, wait.

4179
02:47:13,450 --> 02:47:14,090
We already have 6.

4180
02:47:20,510 --> 02:47:21,170
Oh, shoot.

4181
02:47:21,270 --> 02:47:21,450
Wait.

4182
02:47:21,970 --> 02:47:24,850
Uh... It was... 6 that I could... Oh, here.

4183
02:47:24,970 --> 02:47:27,270
1, 2, 3... 4, 5.

4184
02:47:27,890 --> 02:47:29,030
So, 2, 1.

4185
02:47:30,030 --> 02:47:31,790
Uh... 1, 2, 1.

4186
02:47:32,390 --> 02:47:35,710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

4187
02:47:37,250 --> 02:47:38,290
3, 4, 5.

4188
02:47:40,330 --> 02:47:40,770
Okay.

4189
02:47:41,470 --> 02:47:42,030
Getting there.

4190
02:47:42,210 --> 02:47:42,670
We're getting there.

4191
02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:43,910
Oh my gosh, Liz.

4192
02:47:44,050 --> 02:47:44,910
Thank you for the 15th.

4193
02:47:45,050 --> 02:47:45,570
Thank you.

4194
02:47:45,830 --> 02:47:46,670
Thank you so much.

4195
02:47:47,170 --> 02:47:47,470
Thank you.

4196
02:47:47,530 --> 02:47:47,710
Thank you.

4197
02:47:47,810 --> 02:47:48,310
Thank you.

4198
02:47:48,590 --> 02:47:48,590
Thank you.

4199
02:47:50,930 --> 02:47:52,630
1, 1, 1.

4200
02:47:55,190 --> 02:47:57,130
I sure hope I'm getting this.

4201
02:47:57,330 --> 02:47:59,390
I'm so scared I'm making a mistake.

4202
02:48:01,250 --> 02:48:03,870
I'm so scared I've made a mistake somewhere.

4203
02:48:04,410 --> 02:48:05,990
I'm so scared.

4204
02:48:06,850 --> 02:48:07,970
Holy cow.

4205
02:48:08,410 --> 02:48:09,470
I'm so scared.

4206
02:48:09,650 --> 02:48:10,310
You're doing fine?

4207
02:48:10,530 --> 02:48:10,650
Okay.

4208
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:16,360
Okay.

4209
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:22,800
Okay.

4210
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:26,580
1, 1, 1.

4211
02:48:26,660 --> 02:48:29,520
And it's... It doesn't help that they made the...

4212
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:30,220
I'm sorry.

4213
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:31,260
The X's and...

4214
02:48:31,260 --> 02:48:32,940
Like, they're just too similar of a color.

4215
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:34,780
It's all like... It's all brown.

4216
02:48:35,460 --> 02:48:36,740
It's too similar.

4217
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:39,720
1, 1, 5.

4218
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:40,100
Okay.

4219
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:41,340
Awesome.

4220
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,340
Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.

4221
02:48:50,050 --> 02:48:51,550
This is my necky-neck-o.

4222
02:48:52,630 --> 02:48:53,250
Oh!

4223
02:48:53,910 --> 02:48:54,970
It might be!

4224
02:48:55,670 --> 02:48:58,170
I see the little arm up right here, right?

4225
02:48:59,010 --> 02:48:59,630
Maybe.

4226
02:49:00,230 --> 02:49:01,650
Oh, it might be my necky-neck-o.

4227
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:04,990
Oh!

4228
02:49:06,770 --> 02:49:07,430
I'd rather not!

4229
02:49:07,570 --> 02:49:08,050
Thank you for the gift!

4230
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:08,730
Thank you!

4231
02:49:09,950 --> 02:49:10,750
Thank you, thank you.

4232
02:49:11,190 --> 02:49:12,430
Alright, I think this is 2.

4233
02:49:12,910 --> 02:49:13,610
1, 1.

4234
02:49:14,450 --> 02:49:15,470
Oh, the music's back.

4235
02:49:18,050 --> 02:49:18,970
1, 1, 1.

4236
02:49:19,470 --> 02:49:20,110
1, 1, 2, 3.

4237
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:21,030
5, 5, 6, 7, 8.

4238
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:22,070
Okay!

4239
02:49:27,800 --> 02:49:29,680
So, I think this is 4.

4240
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:31,160
2, 4, 2.

4241
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:33,940
2, 4, 2, 1.

4242
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:38,120
2.

4243
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:38,900
Sorry.

4244
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:39,960
4, 2.

4245
02:49:40,700 --> 02:49:42,300
1, 2.

4246
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:45,220
3, 1.

4247
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:47,720
Another column finished.

4248
02:49:49,340 --> 02:49:50,500
It's Garfield.

4249
02:49:54,620 --> 02:49:56,260
Hits him with his lasagna.

4250
02:50:01,170 --> 02:50:03,230
Alright, 3, oh, 4 here.

4251
02:50:06,930 --> 02:50:09,370
2, 3, 2.

4252
02:50:09,790 --> 02:50:10,230
Awesome.

4253
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:12,150
Oh, 7 here.

4254
02:50:12,910 --> 02:50:13,730
Alright, we got that.

4255
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:18,050
2, 2, 3, 3.

4256
02:50:22,730 --> 02:50:23,890
And then that.

4257
02:50:24,410 --> 02:50:24,670
5.

4258
02:50:26,170 --> 02:50:27,230
Oh, 4.

4259
02:50:27,630 --> 02:50:28,330
1, 2, 3.

4260
02:50:29,010 --> 02:50:30,290
1, 2, 3, 4.

4261
02:50:30,670 --> 02:50:33,130
Which means that is 4 there.

4262
02:50:33,470 --> 02:50:34,990
And then 5 here.

4263
02:50:37,010 --> 02:50:38,370
I think that's it.

4264
02:50:39,110 --> 02:50:39,410
3.

4265
02:50:40,670 --> 02:50:41,190
2.

4266
02:50:42,250 --> 02:50:43,550
1, 1, 1.

4267
02:50:43,810 --> 02:50:44,370
4, 1.

4268
02:50:44,530 --> 02:50:44,710
Yep.

4269
02:50:46,530 --> 02:50:47,470
5, 1.

4270
02:50:47,870 --> 02:50:49,090
Alright, we're almost there!

4271
02:50:50,570 --> 02:50:51,690
We're almost there, guys.

4272
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:52,410
We're almost there.

4273
02:50:58,610 --> 02:50:59,810
Oh my gosh.

4274
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:01,190
1.

4275
02:51:03,150 --> 02:51:03,630
1.

4276
02:51:03,910 --> 02:51:04,170
Wait.

4277
02:51:04,470 --> 02:51:04,650
3.

4278
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:06,710
1.

4279
02:51:07,150 --> 02:51:07,630
2.

4280
02:51:07,810 --> 02:51:07,950
3.

4281
02:51:08,070 --> 02:51:09,570
Oh, this can all be crossed out.

4282
02:51:10,290 --> 02:51:10,750
Wait.

4283
02:51:11,970 --> 02:51:12,450
Yeah.

4284
02:51:12,670 --> 02:51:13,510
That can all be crossed out.

4285
02:51:13,670 --> 02:51:13,890
Awesome.

4286
02:51:16,970 --> 02:51:18,750
5, 1, 1, 2.

4287
02:51:20,290 --> 02:51:20,710
6.

4288
02:51:21,210 --> 02:51:21,390
Okay.

4289
02:51:21,930 --> 02:51:21,990
Okay.

4290
02:51:24,230 --> 02:51:26,470
And then this is gonna be 4 and right.

4291
02:51:26,770 --> 02:51:32,750
5, 1, 3, 2.

4292
02:51:36,780 --> 02:51:37,440
2, 2.

4293
02:51:37,720 --> 02:51:37,820
Okay.

4294
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:45,190
Looks more like a fox now.

4295
02:51:45,690 --> 02:51:46,830
Oh, I think I see it.

4296
02:51:46,890 --> 02:51:48,070
Yeah, because of the pointy ears.

4297
02:51:50,970 --> 02:51:52,830
Oh, it does look more like a fox.

4298
02:51:53,630 --> 02:51:56,510
Oh, so this is 4, 2.

4299
02:52:02,780 --> 02:52:04,480
4, 2, 1, 1, 8.

4300
02:52:04,580 --> 02:52:04,720
Okay.

4301
02:52:05,780 --> 02:52:06,640
All right.

4302
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:12,360
5, 1, 1, 2.

4303
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,480
I almost messed that up just then.

4304
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:16,360
Okay.

4305
02:52:17,400 --> 02:52:17,900
Okay.

4306
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:22,900
This row as well.

4307
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:27,980
1, 1, 2, 3.

4308
02:52:27,980 --> 02:52:29,740
Can't do that one yet.

4309
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:31,180
From that way.

4310
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:32,140
2, 3.

4311
02:52:32,660 --> 02:52:33,340
3.

4312
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:35,480
Okay.

4313
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:35,880
What was it?

4314
02:52:36,320 --> 02:52:37,100
1, 3.

4315
02:52:37,580 --> 02:52:38,300
Like that.

4316
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:40,400
Okay.

4317
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:45,300
I do see tails.

4318
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:47,660
Yeah.

4319
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:50,480
Wait.

4320
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:52,440
3, 1, 1.

4321
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:53,700
Oh my gosh.

4322
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:54,880
It looks so similar.

4323
02:52:55,240 --> 02:52:55,600
4.

4324
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:01,740
2, 2.

4325
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:04,280
2, 3.

4326
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:04,760
Okay.

4327
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:07,580
My eyes!

4328
02:53:10,440 --> 02:53:11,960
5, 1.

4329
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:16,160
4, 1, 1, 2.

4330
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:19,300
2, 2, 1, 2.

4331
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:19,860
Right?

4332
02:53:20,460 --> 02:53:21,540
2, 2, 1, 2.

4333
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:23,080
Okay.

4334
02:53:24,580 --> 02:53:26,400
1, 1, 2.

4335
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:28,460
We're in the homestretch.

4336
02:53:29,560 --> 02:53:30,860
We're in the homestretch.

4337
02:53:32,240 --> 02:53:33,800
What am I even looking at?

4338
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:36,260
I can't see anything.

4339
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:39,440
I can't see anything, literally.

4340
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:40,880
Oh...

4341
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:45,740
4, 1, 1, 2.

4342
02:53:45,960 --> 02:53:46,920
4, 1, 1, 2.

4343
02:53:47,240 --> 02:53:47,660
What?

4344
02:53:48,080 --> 02:53:48,440
What?

4345
02:53:49,640 --> 02:53:49,740
What?

4346
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:49,860
What?

4347
02:53:49,860 --> 02:53:50,000
What?

4348
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:50,280
What?

4349
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:50,460
What?

4350
02:53:50,460 --> 02:53:50,520
What?

4351
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:50,540
What?

4352
02:53:50,540 --> 02:53:50,720
What?

4353
02:53:51,240 --> 02:53:52,120
Oh gosh.

4354
02:53:52,300 --> 02:53:52,360
Okay.

4355
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:55,060
3, 3.

4356
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:56,560
So this would be 1.

4357
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:00,140
Now 4...

4358
02:54:00,140 --> 02:54:00,240
Wait.

4359
02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:02,260
5, 1, 1.

4360
02:54:03,960 --> 02:54:05,460
2, 1, 1.

4361
02:54:10,060 --> 02:54:13,640
I feel like I need to hold this from so far...

4362
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:14,920
Oh, Tenki-chan!

4363
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:16,340
It's been so long!

4364
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:25,580
Oh my gosh...

4365
02:54:25,580 --> 02:54:26,420
Oh, Tenki-chan.

4366
02:54:26,680 --> 02:54:27,740
It's been so long.

4367
02:54:29,800 --> 02:54:30,640
Wow.

4368
02:54:30,640 --> 02:54:30,840
Wow.

4369
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:36,640
Um...

4370
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:37,060
Okay.

4371
02:54:39,340 --> 02:54:40,460
Thanks for the report.

4372
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:41,000
Okay.

4373
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:41,280
Okay.

4374
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:42,900
We're like... we're just a couple away.

4375
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:44,220
I need to lock in.

4376
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:44,920
I need to lock in.

4377
02:54:45,140 --> 02:54:45,380
Okay.

4378
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:46,200
So two, two.

4379
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:48,140
So it's this one.

4380
02:54:56,010 --> 02:54:57,430
A hidden compartment.

4381
02:54:58,070 --> 02:54:59,730
Who would hide something here?

4382
02:55:00,710 --> 02:55:02,750
I didn't even make any mistakes.

4383
02:55:03,530 --> 02:55:05,230
Over 600 squares clicked.

4384
02:55:05,410 --> 02:55:05,810
Great job.

4385
02:55:05,950 --> 02:55:06,570
Thank you.

4386
02:55:08,330 --> 02:55:09,590
Oh my god.

4387
02:55:09,990 --> 02:55:10,590
Wait, what?

4388
02:55:10,950 --> 02:55:11,110
Oh.

4389
02:55:11,850 --> 02:55:12,510
The note.

4390
02:55:13,610 --> 02:55:14,590
To my daughters.

4391
02:55:14,930 --> 02:55:17,310
I hope that you will never need to see this note.

4392
02:55:17,490 --> 02:55:20,450
But I'm worried that I might be leaving you much sooner than I wanted to.

4393
02:55:20,830 --> 02:55:21,430
Than I want to.

4394
02:55:21,710 --> 02:55:23,170
There are a few things you need to know.

4395
02:55:23,750 --> 02:55:25,430
First, you need to take care of each other.

4396
02:55:25,630 --> 02:55:27,850
If you found this, it's because you've worked together.

4397
02:55:28,390 --> 02:55:28,470
Oh.

4398
02:55:29,150 --> 02:55:29,870
Keep it up.

4399
02:55:30,230 --> 02:55:33,790
On your 15th birthday, I will give you each half of what you need...

4400
02:55:34,350 --> 02:55:36,270
Of what you needed to find this note.

4401
02:55:37,090 --> 02:55:40,150
I know you'll be able to work things out between each other if you try.

4402
02:55:40,570 --> 02:55:41,970
Please try as a favor to me.

4403
02:55:43,450 --> 02:55:45,910
Second, the ryokan is just a place and nothing more.

4404
02:55:46,270 --> 02:55:48,190
Neither of you have to stay to take care of it.

4405
02:55:48,750 --> 02:55:48,950
Oh.

4406
02:55:49,170 --> 02:55:50,250
These are your lives.

4407
02:55:50,450 --> 02:55:52,310
You have to live in a way that makes you happy.

4408
02:55:52,310 --> 02:55:55,150
All I ask is that you work out your decision together.

4409
02:55:56,190 --> 02:55:58,870
How nice of the mother to write this in perfect English.

4410
02:55:59,270 --> 02:55:59,510
I know.

4411
02:56:01,490 --> 02:56:03,730
Finally, if you're reading this, then I'm sorry.

4412
02:56:03,990 --> 02:56:06,710
If I had my way, I'd be there for you always.

4413
02:56:07,030 --> 02:56:09,490
Take care of each other and take care of your grandmother.

4414
02:56:09,490 --> 02:56:12,150
I know she disagrees with what I want for you, too.

4415
02:56:12,550 --> 02:56:13,630
But don't take that personally.

4416
02:56:13,890 --> 02:56:16,950
In her own way, she only wants the best for you, too.

4417
02:56:18,410 --> 02:56:18,810
No!

4418
02:56:18,970 --> 02:56:19,790
We got a katana!

4419
02:56:20,430 --> 02:56:22,510
The ultimate password, Kasumi Sonicose.

4420
02:56:24,830 --> 02:56:25,510
Wait, hold on.

4421
02:56:25,570 --> 02:56:26,410
Let me save also.

4422
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:27,350
Holy cow.

4423
02:56:28,350 --> 02:56:29,030
And then there's a bunny.

4424
02:56:29,490 --> 02:56:30,390
That's not important.

4425
02:56:30,390 --> 02:56:32,010
Just the katana?

4426
02:56:32,590 --> 02:56:32,710
Okay.

4427
02:56:34,170 --> 02:56:34,710
Uh-oh.

4428
02:56:35,570 --> 02:56:35,830
Ah!

4429
02:56:36,350 --> 02:56:36,870
Ah!

4430
02:56:40,750 --> 02:56:43,550
I've got to find a way to cut these cords in half and fast.

4431
02:56:43,910 --> 02:56:45,150
Wait, what do you mean by that?

4432
02:56:45,530 --> 02:56:46,870
The sword?

4433
02:56:50,440 --> 02:56:52,160
Cut faster, Nancy!

4434
02:56:52,720 --> 02:56:53,640
Oh my god.

4435
02:56:55,400 --> 02:56:56,460
What do I cut?

4436
02:56:58,440 --> 02:56:59,500
What do I cut?

4437
02:57:02,920 --> 02:57:03,620
No way.

4438
02:57:03,760 --> 02:57:04,360
I'm gonna die.

4439
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:04,800
Wait.

4440
02:57:05,240 --> 02:57:05,340
What?

4441
02:57:05,620 --> 02:57:06,060
What?

4442
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:06,780
What?

4443
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:07,080
What?

4444
02:57:10,050 --> 02:57:11,510
Good timing on that save.

4445
02:57:11,650 --> 02:57:12,110
No kidding!

4446
02:57:18,350 --> 02:57:20,410
This is a puzzle that I don't understand.

4447
02:57:20,770 --> 02:57:20,990
Uh-oh.

4448
02:57:21,090 --> 02:57:21,650
We're so dead.

4449
02:57:22,970 --> 02:57:23,790
Make a pat...

4450
02:57:25,010 --> 02:57:25,450
Wow!

4451
02:57:25,810 --> 02:57:26,270
Oh my gosh.

4452
02:57:26,470 --> 02:57:27,270
Nancy actually...

4453
02:57:27,270 --> 02:57:29,090
There is no good news!

4454
02:57:29,430 --> 02:57:31,170
Now you know how long you can hold your breath.

4455
02:57:31,470 --> 02:57:31,890
Bad news.

4456
02:57:32,030 --> 02:57:34,290
It is less time than presently required.

4457
02:57:34,890 --> 02:57:35,410
That's...

4458
02:57:35,410 --> 02:57:35,750
There is...

4459
02:57:36,990 --> 02:57:38,410
Game, read the room.

4460
02:57:38,830 --> 02:57:39,890
What is happening?

4461
02:57:40,190 --> 02:57:41,790
I'm drowning by the ghost!

4462
02:57:42,610 --> 02:57:43,350
Oh no!

4463
02:57:43,630 --> 02:57:45,650
I'd better find a way to cut these cords in half.

4464
02:57:45,850 --> 02:57:46,210
And fast!

4465
02:57:46,570 --> 02:57:47,250
I don't under...

4466
02:57:47,250 --> 02:57:47,410
Wait.

4467
02:57:47,630 --> 02:57:49,110
So, path from bottom to top.

4468
02:57:49,290 --> 02:57:49,370
Oh.

4469
02:57:54,220 --> 02:57:55,020
Like this?

4470
02:57:55,320 --> 02:57:56,600
If I like connect them?

4471
02:58:00,050 --> 02:58:01,430
Is it cutting both of them?

4472
02:58:02,290 --> 02:58:02,710
No.

4473
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:07,760
Timed wire puzzle.

4474
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:08,640
Oh god.

4475
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:11,420
I don't know if I'm doing this right.

4476
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:12,220
Girl, no.

4477
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:13,260
I don't know what I'm doing!

4478
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:16,600
What do you mean Vito?

4479
02:58:16,900 --> 02:58:17,680
I just...

4480
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:18,200
How...

4481
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:18,620
Me.

4482
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:19,600
I don't know what I'm doing.

4483
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:21,220
Everybody judging me in chat.

4484
02:58:36,500 --> 02:58:38,140
You were just drowned by a ghost.

4485
02:58:38,360 --> 02:58:38,620
Good news.

4486
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:41,400
The inscription on your tombstone is going to be the coolest ever.

4487
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:42,980
Yeah?

4488
02:58:43,300 --> 02:58:43,620
Maybe.

4489
02:58:46,980 --> 02:58:48,760
Separate the left and right parts.

4490
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:49,240
Wait.

4491
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:49,440
What?

4492
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:53,680
Cut into two pieces.

4493
02:58:54,380 --> 02:58:54,520
What?

4494
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:54,620
What?

4495
02:58:54,780 --> 02:58:56,000
You guys are so confusing.

4496
02:58:57,680 --> 02:58:58,900
You guys are so confusing.

4497
02:58:59,160 --> 02:58:59,280
Okay.

4498
02:58:59,320 --> 02:58:59,500
Hold on.

4499
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:01,140
I need water really bad.

4500
02:59:01,140 --> 02:59:02,880
In a second.

4501
02:59:03,180 --> 02:59:03,380
Okay.

4502
02:59:03,440 --> 02:59:03,720
Hold on.

4503
02:59:04,720 --> 02:59:04,980
Oh.

4504
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:07,420
I hate that I need to take out my knife each time.

4505
02:59:07,580 --> 02:59:07,680
Okay.

4506
02:59:07,720 --> 02:59:07,960
Hold on.

4507
02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:14,980
Diagonal?

4508
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:20,500
I wish that...

4509
02:59:20,500 --> 02:59:21,560
Nancy, be efficient!

4510
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:22,660
Cut two at once!

4511
02:59:25,060 --> 02:59:25,780
Be efficient.

4512
02:59:25,940 --> 02:59:27,860
What's the shortest way to go, I wonder?

4513
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:29,360
Oh, wait!

4514
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:31,000
I think this might be the shortest one.

4515
02:59:32,300 --> 02:59:32,920
Oh, hold on.

4516
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:33,340
Redo!

4517
02:59:33,460 --> 02:59:33,980
Redo, please!

4518
02:59:34,900 --> 02:59:35,260
Wait.

4519
02:59:35,360 --> 02:59:35,460
No.

4520
02:59:35,560 --> 02:59:36,080
What are you doing?

4521
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:37,900
What did you just do?

4522
02:59:38,020 --> 02:59:38,220
No!

4523
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:39,180
I didn't click that one!

4524
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:40,820
I think this one might be the shortest.

4525
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:43,500
Okay, Nancy.

4526
02:59:43,620 --> 02:59:43,940
Redo.

4527
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:45,760
I'll save you, Nancy.

4528
02:59:49,640 --> 02:59:50,020
Okay.

4529
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:51,340
Okay.

4530
02:59:52,220 --> 02:59:53,580
If I'm supposed to cut it...

4531
02:59:53,580 --> 02:59:53,780
Oh, no!

4532
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:55,960
I'd better find a way to cut these cords in half!

4533
02:59:56,220 --> 02:59:56,260
Okay.

4534
02:59:56,260 --> 02:59:56,600
And fast!

4535
02:59:57,160 --> 02:59:59,560
If I'm supposed to cut it in half...

4536
03:00:00,040 --> 03:00:02,860
Like everybody says I'm supposed to do...

4537
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:03,800
Thank you for the super tie.

4538
03:00:03,900 --> 03:00:04,360
I can't read it.

4539
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:04,780
I'm sorry.

4540
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:21,520
That one.

4541
03:00:24,080 --> 03:00:24,780
And then this.

4542
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:28,520
No?

4543
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:29,120
This?

4544
03:00:31,400 --> 03:00:31,840
Nope.

4545
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:33,700
I followed the line.

4546
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:34,320
It didn't work.

4547
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:40,560
It

4548
03:00:43,750 --> 03:00:44,130
didn't...

4549
03:00:44,130 --> 03:00:45,750
Oh, I missed one!

4550
03:00:46,070 --> 03:00:46,730
No way.

4551
03:00:47,250 --> 03:00:47,890
I did?

4552
03:00:48,910 --> 03:00:50,450
There was one connection missed.

4553
03:00:50,590 --> 03:00:51,190
No way!

4554
03:00:52,810 --> 03:00:54,210
You left it connected in the middle.

4555
03:00:54,330 --> 03:00:54,490
I did?

4556
03:00:54,590 --> 03:00:54,830
Hold on.

4557
03:00:54,930 --> 03:00:55,890
I need water like...

4558
03:00:55,890 --> 03:00:57,410
Desperate bad right now, you guys.

4559
03:00:57,510 --> 03:00:57,750
Hold on.

4560
03:01:56,210 --> 03:01:57,250
Okay, okay, okay.

4561
03:01:57,550 --> 03:01:57,770
Alright.

4562
03:01:58,170 --> 03:01:59,050
Let's try this again.

4563
03:01:59,150 --> 03:01:59,470
Oh, no!

4564
03:01:59,770 --> 03:02:00,070
Oh, no!

4565
03:02:00,070 --> 03:02:01,730
I'd better find a way to cut these cords in half!

4566
03:02:01,910 --> 03:02:02,270
And fast!

4567
03:02:02,370 --> 03:02:02,710
Oh, shoot.

4568
03:02:03,150 --> 03:02:04,270
Which one did I miss?

4569
03:02:07,790 --> 03:02:09,010
Actually, I wonder if this one...

4570
03:02:09,010 --> 03:02:09,350
Oh, no.

4571
03:02:09,570 --> 03:02:10,670
Oh, I'm wasting time.

4572
03:02:12,790 --> 03:02:14,970
What in the graph theory is this puzzle?

4573
03:02:15,210 --> 03:02:15,910
I don't know!

4574
03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:16,630
Welcome back!

4575
03:02:16,690 --> 03:02:17,090
Thank you!

4576
03:02:17,370 --> 03:02:18,230
Wait, did I miss up here?

4577
03:02:18,230 --> 03:02:18,270
Another?

4578
03:02:24,950 --> 03:02:25,750
Okay.

4579
03:02:26,770 --> 03:02:28,470
The middle straight horizontal.

4580
03:02:29,010 --> 03:02:29,250
Huh?

4581
03:02:29,370 --> 03:02:29,690
This one?

4582
03:02:33,330 --> 03:02:34,310
Oh, no!

4583
03:02:34,990 --> 03:02:36,370
I missed the middle.

4584
03:02:36,930 --> 03:02:37,930
What's the middle?

4585
03:02:38,170 --> 03:02:38,570
This one?

4586
03:02:39,010 --> 03:02:39,710
This one?

4587
03:02:41,130 --> 03:02:41,530
This one?

4588
03:02:41,530 --> 03:02:42,050
This one?

4589
03:02:42,050 --> 03:02:42,610
The teeny one?

4590
03:02:43,030 --> 03:02:44,290
Oh, my God!

4591
03:02:44,690 --> 03:02:46,070
Nancy, come faster!

4592
03:02:48,170 --> 03:02:49,870
Nancy, come faster!

4593
03:02:49,870 --> 03:02:50,070
Water!

4594
03:03:01,310 --> 03:03:03,050
Why cut the rope from both sides?

4595
03:03:03,350 --> 03:03:04,110
I don't know.

4596
03:03:04,630 --> 03:03:05,350
Voice crack.

4597
03:03:05,510 --> 03:03:07,050
I know, my voice is really bad.

4598
03:03:08,010 --> 03:03:09,230
That's why I needed water.

4599
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:23,760
What is going on?

4600
03:03:24,060 --> 03:03:24,620
Wait.

4601
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:26,760
What is going on here?

4602
03:03:26,900 --> 03:03:27,080
Okay.

4603
03:03:28,140 --> 03:03:32,960
Let's see if we can use this tiny little preview to figure out what I need to cut.

4604
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:38,140
So, I've been doing this one.

4605
03:03:39,560 --> 03:03:42,060
Just line up the crosshair and use...

4606
03:03:42,060 --> 03:03:42,640
What?

4607
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:44,880
Oh, sand...

4608
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:45,960
Sand...

4609
03:03:45,960 --> 03:03:46,020
Sand...

4610
03:03:46,020 --> 03:03:46,740
That drew...

4611
03:03:50,060 --> 03:03:50,540
Hmm...

4612
03:03:50,540 --> 03:03:51,280
Uh...

4613
03:03:51,280 --> 03:03:53,100
The corner is where they connect to the wood.

4614
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:55,280
This?

4615
03:03:56,420 --> 03:03:56,900
No.

4616
03:03:57,340 --> 03:03:57,600
There's...

4617
03:03:57,600 --> 03:03:58,380
No, that's not...

4618
03:03:58,380 --> 03:03:58,560
No.

4619
03:03:58,980 --> 03:04:02,620
There's no way that I would be able to cut that much in this little bit of time.

4620
03:04:12,780 --> 03:04:13,260
Um...

4621
03:04:18,320 --> 03:04:20,700
Maybe I'll just do what I did before but try and be faster.

4622
03:04:22,540 --> 03:04:24,160
I don't know if I need to cut this top one.

4623
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:24,800
Probably though.

4624
03:04:27,160 --> 03:04:28,780
I don't think I'm going to get it this time either.

4625
03:04:36,810 --> 03:04:38,510
I don't think I'm going to get it.

4626
03:04:39,410 --> 03:04:40,750
I don't think it's timed.

4627
03:04:40,990 --> 03:04:42,470
I 100% think it's timed.

4628
03:04:42,810 --> 03:04:43,030
I don't think it's timed.

4629
03:04:45,050 --> 03:04:46,190
Oh, oh, oh.

4630
03:04:46,790 --> 03:04:47,670
Please, please!

4631
03:04:48,470 --> 03:04:48,930
Please!

4632
03:04:49,230 --> 03:04:49,890
Nancy, don't die!

4633
03:04:52,090 --> 03:04:52,530
Okay.

4634
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:00,880
Wow.

4635
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:02,500
Being a human is rough some days.

4636
03:05:04,480 --> 03:05:04,920
Ugh.

4637
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:06,120
Okay.

4638
03:05:06,300 --> 03:05:06,680
Oh, no!

4639
03:05:08,760 --> 03:05:09,200
Okay.

4640
03:05:18,400 --> 03:05:20,020
I'm cutting parts I don't need to.

4641
03:05:20,280 --> 03:05:21,640
I don't know what I need to!

4642
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:23,340
I'm just cutting a...

4643
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:24,260
I'm doing a...

4644
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:27,380
I'm making a line like I was told to by people in the beginning.

4645
03:05:31,860 --> 03:05:35,440
People said, hey, you should make a line from the top to the bottom.

4646
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:36,620
That's what I'm doing.

4647
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:41,860
Well, hold on.

4648
03:05:41,960 --> 03:05:42,500
Let's see now.

4649
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:44,060
Oh!

4650
03:05:44,820 --> 03:05:45,880
Where did the ghost go?

4651
03:05:47,800 --> 03:05:49,380
Oh, the ghost is down here.

4652
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:53,900
The joint near the elbow looks a lot like what Rentaro was working on in his shed.

4653
03:06:02,130 --> 03:06:03,010
Ren-Taro?

4654
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:09,340
Ren-Taro, you say?

4655
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:23,200
She's head-banging.

4656
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:24,080
Head-o-bang!

4657
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:24,420
Yeah!

4658
03:06:30,910 --> 03:06:31,730
Head-o-bang!

4659
03:06:31,870 --> 03:06:32,310
Head-o-bang!

4660
03:06:34,670 --> 03:06:34,830
Head-o-bang!

4661
03:06:34,830 --> 03:06:35,110
Head-o-bang!

4662
03:06:35,290 --> 03:06:35,950
Head-o-bang!

4663
03:06:39,310 --> 03:06:40,190
Let me out of here.

4664
03:06:41,750 --> 03:06:42,170
Um...

4665
03:06:42,170 --> 03:06:42,690
Time...

4666
03:06:42,690 --> 03:06:42,870
Uh...

4667
03:06:42,870 --> 03:06:44,670
Ren-Taro, you have some splainin' to do.

4668
03:06:44,970 --> 03:06:47,550
And also, you're going to jail for attempted murder.

4669
03:06:48,590 --> 03:06:49,590
Not even attempted!

4670
03:06:49,990 --> 03:06:50,850
Nancy died!

4671
03:06:53,370 --> 03:06:54,610
That wasn't my fault.

4672
03:06:54,730 --> 03:06:55,810
It was your fault, Ren-Taro.

4673
03:06:58,810 --> 03:06:59,750
Miywako, your boyfriend.

4674
03:06:59,850 --> 03:07:00,370
Get away from him!

4675
03:07:00,410 --> 03:07:00,790
He's a...

4676
03:07:00,790 --> 03:07:01,510
He's a psychopath.

4677
03:07:02,050 --> 03:07:03,070
Wait, what time is it?

4678
03:07:03,550 --> 03:07:04,370
Why is it...

4679
03:07:04,910 --> 03:07:05,330
Wait...

4680
03:07:05,330 --> 03:07:06,710
Miywako's not here, but it's 7.

4681
03:07:06,710 --> 03:07:07,990
Uh-oh.

4682
03:07:09,310 --> 03:07:10,430
Wait...

4683
03:07:10,430 --> 03:07:11,370
What's going on?

4684
03:07:12,730 --> 03:07:13,150
Ah!

4685
03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:14,630
Nobody's here.

4686
03:07:16,490 --> 03:07:17,870
But it's only 7pm!

4687
03:07:22,710 --> 03:07:23,870
Where could they be?

4688
03:07:26,390 --> 03:07:27,510
Um...

4689
03:07:27,510 --> 03:07:28,030
Hello?

4690
03:07:28,770 --> 03:07:29,390
Any...

4691
03:07:32,870 --> 03:07:34,390
Maybe they're in the bathtub...

4692
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:35,110
In here?

4693
03:07:35,370 --> 03:07:35,910
No, I can't call.

4694
03:07:35,910 --> 03:07:37,150
I'll have to wait until later.

4695
03:07:37,250 --> 03:07:38,150
Uh, this is an emergency.

4696
03:07:38,370 --> 03:07:39,050
I think we're fine.

4697
03:07:40,270 --> 03:07:41,650
Uh, let's try calling.

4698
03:07:45,130 --> 03:07:45,930
Y-Yumi?

4699
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:51,000
Hello!

4700
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:52,280
Oh my god, Yumi!

4701
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:53,240
I'm not in!

4702
03:07:53,240 --> 03:07:53,640
Bye-bye!

4703
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:54,480
It's an emergency!

4704
03:07:54,480 --> 03:07:54,720
Nancy!

4705
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:57,020
I already saved.

4706
03:07:57,180 --> 03:07:57,760
We're all good.

4707
03:07:57,880 --> 03:07:58,180
We're all good.

4708
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:00,120
Uh...

4709
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:00,600
Do I have...

4710
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:01,120
Is this me?

4711
03:08:07,520 --> 03:08:10,500
Nancy died so many times, she might as well be the ghost yourself, right?

4712
03:08:11,720 --> 03:08:12,240
Hello!

4713
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:14,020
Not in!

4714
03:08:14,720 --> 03:08:15,280
Bye-bye!

4715
03:08:15,620 --> 03:08:16,300
Nancy, how's it going?

4716
03:08:17,240 --> 03:08:19,440
I know who's behind everything.

4717
03:08:19,700 --> 03:08:20,680
It's Rintaro.

4718
03:08:20,900 --> 03:08:23,640
And that fake ghost of his almost drowned me.

4719
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:24,580
Oh no!

4720
03:08:25,400 --> 03:08:26,440
I'm glad you're okay.

4721
03:08:26,920 --> 03:08:28,220
Where's Rintaro now?

4722
03:08:28,220 --> 03:08:28,780
I don't know!

4723
03:08:29,280 --> 03:08:29,940
I'm not sure.

4724
03:08:30,260 --> 03:08:33,160
But I'm gonna track him down and find out what his problem is.

4725
03:08:33,320 --> 03:08:34,800
Be careful, Nancy.

4726
03:08:35,280 --> 03:08:37,180
Um, we're also going to- I'll talk to you later.

4727
03:08:37,300 --> 03:08:38,680
We're also going to send him to jail.

4728
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:39,140
Talk to you later.

4729
03:08:39,140 --> 03:08:40,980
He literally attempted murder!

4730
03:08:44,240 --> 03:08:45,400
Grandma- Grandma's here!

4731
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:46,360
Hello, Nancy-san.

4732
03:08:46,700 --> 03:08:48,720
Did you know about Kasumi's will?

4733
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:51,040
She did not have a will.

4734
03:08:51,320 --> 03:08:52,560
She was too young.

4735
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:53,900
She did.

4736
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:55,260
I found it.

4737
03:08:55,640 --> 03:08:56,120
No.

4738
03:08:56,120 --> 03:08:58,980
You don't understand what you found.

4739
03:08:59,340 --> 03:09:02,520
Whatever that says, she didn't mean it.

4740
03:09:02,600 --> 03:09:03,220
Grandma?

4741
03:09:04,160 --> 03:09:06,020
She told you what she wanted, didn't she?

4742
03:09:06,420 --> 03:09:07,980
And you ignored it.

4743
03:09:08,380 --> 03:09:09,320
Oh, the smile.

4744
03:09:09,940 --> 03:09:09,960
No.

4745
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:11,120
You don't understand.

4746
03:09:11,960 --> 03:09:14,400
Oh, I understand perfectly.

4747
03:09:14,400 --> 03:09:20,020
You didn't tell the girls what their mother really wanted because you're afraid of losing the Ria Khan.

4748
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:20,920
The Ria Khan?

4749
03:09:21,300 --> 03:09:24,820
You made up all of this ghost business to scare the girls into doing what you want.

4750
03:09:25,720 --> 03:09:26,160
Stop!

4751
03:09:26,500 --> 03:09:26,980
Stop!

4752
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:28,260
You're wrong!

4753
03:09:29,800 --> 03:09:30,960
What do you mean?

4754
03:09:31,200 --> 03:09:31,680
What do you mean?

4755
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:32,640
What do you mean, Nancy?

4756
03:09:32,840 --> 03:09:36,600
You- What do you mean, Nancy, about what do you mean?

4757
03:09:36,880 --> 03:09:38,280
I knew what Kasumi wanted.

4758
03:09:38,280 --> 03:09:38,540
What do you mean?

4759
03:09:38,540 --> 03:09:40,960
Then why did you hide it from them?

4760
03:09:41,400 --> 03:09:43,780
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

4761
03:09:44,300 --> 03:09:45,140
Try me.

4762
03:09:45,520 --> 03:09:47,680
I can't lose them too.

4763
03:09:48,440 --> 03:09:51,480
There's no guaranteeing that they'll leave if they know the truth.

4764
03:09:52,220 --> 03:09:53,880
Yes, there is.

4765
03:09:54,040 --> 03:09:57,100
There is too much sadness for them here.

4766
03:09:57,100 --> 03:09:58,200
I think we need to find Ren Taro.

4767
03:09:58,340 --> 03:10:05,620
They've forgotten about how things used to be before, before she died.

4768
03:10:06,320 --> 03:10:11,240
They've forgotten about how this used to be our home.

4769
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:12,140
Our home.

4770
03:10:12,260 --> 03:10:15,060
But why would you fake these hauntings if you want them to stay?

4771
03:10:15,560 --> 03:10:17,740
I would never do that.

4772
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:21,760
I think- I think it's still Ren Taro.

4773
03:10:22,060 --> 03:10:23,100
But also...

4774
03:10:24,380 --> 03:10:24,860
Um...

4775
03:10:24,860 --> 03:10:25,960
Hold on, I'm gonna say it real quick.

4776
03:10:29,220 --> 03:10:29,720
Uh...

4777
03:10:30,440 --> 03:10:33,400
Cause I think if I say I don't believe you, she might get arrested.

4778
03:10:34,980 --> 03:10:35,480
Um...

4779
03:10:36,760 --> 03:10:37,260
Um...

4780
03:10:38,220 --> 03:10:39,200
What was I gonna say?

4781
03:10:39,400 --> 03:10:39,980
I don't- Oh!

4782
03:10:40,800 --> 03:10:41,920
I don't remember, sorry.

4783
03:10:43,940 --> 03:10:46,860
I think maybe I jumped to a decision too quickly.

4784
03:10:47,240 --> 03:10:49,560
I know you mean well, Nancy-san.

4785
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:51,780
You can't help us here.

4786
03:10:52,280 --> 03:10:54,300
But thank you for trying.

4787
03:10:54,300 --> 03:10:56,660
What really happened to Kasumi?

4788
03:10:56,860 --> 03:10:57,900
I need to know.

4789
03:10:58,460 --> 03:11:00,540
The police said it was an accident.

4790
03:11:01,160 --> 03:11:03,340
It wasn't an accident.

4791
03:11:03,780 --> 03:11:04,780
What did happen?

4792
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:08,280
It was my job to take care of the bass.

4793
03:11:08,820 --> 03:11:10,780
I was supposed to be there.

4794
03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:12,080
She...

4795
03:11:12,080 --> 03:11:12,960
She...

4796
03:11:12,960 --> 03:11:16,620
She was supposed to be meeting with that pen pal friend of hers.

4797
03:11:16,640 --> 03:11:16,800
Marianne!

4798
03:11:16,980 --> 03:11:17,200
Downtown.

4799
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:20,740
She was so excited to go.

4800
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:22,680
I should have let her go.

4801
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:25,660
I should have taken care of everything myself.

4802
03:11:25,660 --> 03:11:25,900
But I didn't want to.

4803
03:11:25,900 --> 03:11:28,500
She would have gotten final destination probably on the way there.

4804
03:11:28,660 --> 03:11:28,700
But I didn't want to.

4805
03:11:28,700 --> 03:11:30,660
I didn't like her going into the city.

4806
03:11:30,940 --> 03:11:33,720
I didn't like that pen pal of hers.

4807
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:38,060
Always getting her so wound up about leaving here.

4808
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:39,480
So...

4809
03:11:39,480 --> 03:11:40,580
Do you think they were...

4810
03:11:40,580 --> 03:11:42,880
I played sick, so she couldn't go.

4811
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:44,620
I don't understand.

4812
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:45,460
What are you...

4813
03:11:45,460 --> 03:11:46,460
Nancy, come on.

4814
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:48,600
Nancy, use your brain.

4815
03:11:48,600 --> 03:11:49,780
You must know where to walk.

4816
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:53,500
There was a reason I never let her do that part.

4817
03:11:53,500 --> 03:11:57,260
But I wasn't thinking about that.

4818
03:11:57,680 --> 03:11:59,300
I was too selfish.

4819
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:03,540
She drowned that night in the bats.

4820
03:12:04,240 --> 03:12:06,880
It should have been me down there.

4821
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:09,960
And she knows that.

4822
03:12:10,760 --> 03:12:12,920
You can't blame yourself for that.

4823
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:14,880
You don't understand.

4824
03:12:15,500 --> 03:12:16,620
I do.

4825
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:18,120
Accidents happen.

4826
03:12:18,380 --> 03:12:23,560
As much as we wish they didn't, you can't keep everyone safe, no matter how hard you try.

4827
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:27,240
It is different for a parent, Nancy-san.

4828
03:12:28,100 --> 03:12:30,400
Miwako and Yumi blame themselves, too.

4829
03:12:30,740 --> 03:12:34,560
If you can't let Kasumi go, how will you be able to help the girls?

4830
03:12:34,940 --> 03:12:36,400
I don't know...

4831
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:38,220
if I can do that.

4832
03:12:45,480 --> 03:12:48,040
Well, if I was Rintaro, where would I be?

4833
03:12:48,040 --> 03:12:48,280
Yeah.

4834
03:12:55,820 --> 03:12:56,940
You scumbag!

4835
03:13:00,380 --> 03:13:03,480
This must be the recorder Rintaro was talking about earlier.

4836
03:13:03,860 --> 03:13:06,480
I'll take this and leave the other one here.

4837
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:07,640
Okay.

4838
03:13:08,160 --> 03:13:08,720
Mine?

4839
03:13:09,380 --> 03:13:09,940
And...

4840
03:13:09,940 --> 03:13:11,240
The other one?

4841
03:13:11,900 --> 03:13:13,080
Did I leave it?

4842
03:13:14,820 --> 03:13:15,900
Is this...

4843
03:13:15,900 --> 03:13:16,740
Oh my gosh.

4844
03:13:16,880 --> 03:13:17,740
Is this the one I'm leaving?

4845
03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:18,160
Ah!

4846
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:18,560
Stop!

4847
03:13:18,680 --> 03:13:18,780
Stop!

4848
03:13:18,880 --> 03:13:19,280
It's so loud!

4849
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:20,560
Is...

4850
03:13:20,560 --> 03:13:21,360
Which one am I leaving?

4851
03:13:22,960 --> 03:13:24,040
Which one am I leaving?

4852
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:26,440
Okay.

4853
03:13:30,260 --> 03:13:31,080
Oh, there we go.

4854
03:13:32,440 --> 03:13:32,880
Okay.

4855
03:13:33,180 --> 03:13:34,240
I think we're good.

4856
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:36,520
Okay.

4857
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:37,420
What's this here?

4858
03:13:37,420 --> 03:13:40,340
I should translate this and figure out what he's up to.

4859
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:41,180
Oh, no!

4860
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:48,040
Must finish today.

4861
03:13:48,380 --> 03:13:48,420
Oh.

4862
03:13:51,260 --> 03:13:52,540
Finish us off!

4863
03:13:54,060 --> 03:13:54,920
Oh, it's this.

4864
03:13:55,080 --> 03:13:57,740
I thought he meant like he was trying to finish us today.

4865
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:02,860
I was like...

4866
03:14:07,490 --> 03:14:08,790
Finish her!

4867
03:14:10,510 --> 03:14:11,770
Wait, what did I just get?

4868
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:16,040
Oh.

4869
03:14:16,360 --> 03:14:16,480
Oh.

4870
03:14:16,660 --> 03:14:16,960
Stop it.

4871
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:22,780
I was like, he's really trying to kill us.

4872
03:14:25,120 --> 03:14:26,240
Oh my god.

4873
03:14:31,280 --> 03:14:32,300
Um, hello?

4874
03:14:33,440 --> 03:14:34,240
Suki doko.

4875
03:14:34,380 --> 03:14:35,980
Suki doko.

4876
03:14:35,980 --> 03:14:37,000
Suki doko.

4877
03:14:37,840 --> 03:14:38,220
Oh.

4878
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:40,080
Hey, Suki.

4879
03:14:40,260 --> 03:14:41,580
You're not even a real cat.

4880
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:43,040
Why are we bullying her?

4881
03:14:45,120 --> 03:14:47,620
Why are we bullying the robot cat?

4882
03:14:50,520 --> 03:14:51,160
Hello?

4883
03:14:53,020 --> 03:14:54,740
Nancy, what's wrong with you?

4884
03:14:55,900 --> 03:14:57,080
Where could they be?

4885
03:14:57,580 --> 03:14:57,760
Where could they be?

4886
03:14:57,760 --> 03:14:59,000
Maybe in my room.

4887
03:15:01,600 --> 03:15:02,160
Hello?

4888
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:04,080
Um.

4889
03:15:05,620 --> 03:15:10,500
I can't believe Nancy couldn't even like fend off a robot on top of her.

4890
03:15:11,140 --> 03:15:12,680
How weak are you, Nancy?

4891
03:15:21,680 --> 03:15:23,560
Room 33 is what the paper said.

4892
03:15:23,620 --> 03:15:23,980
What paper?

4893
03:15:28,460 --> 03:15:30,300
Wait, is the paper in here?

4894
03:15:32,540 --> 03:15:34,980
Is room 33 not the one that...

4895
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:39,980
Oh yeah, it says room 33, but...

4896
03:15:42,420 --> 03:15:44,680
That's where the underground tunnel is, no?

4897
03:15:45,140 --> 03:15:46,400
Yeah, it's the hidden room.

4898
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:47,980
Suki will remember this.

4899
03:15:50,460 --> 03:15:51,020
Oh.

4900
03:16:04,860 --> 03:16:06,040
Unless we have to go back down.

4901
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:11,880
Yeah, I know.

4902
03:16:17,380 --> 03:16:17,760
Oh.

4903
03:16:19,440 --> 03:16:20,880
Wait, is that the... is that the one?

4904
03:16:21,380 --> 03:16:21,760
Yeah.

4905
03:16:22,060 --> 03:16:22,420
What?

4906
03:16:22,500 --> 03:16:23,680
Why is it working anymore?

4907
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:26,540
Uh...

4908
03:16:31,660 --> 03:16:32,040
Okay...

4909
03:16:32,040 --> 03:16:33,040
Oh, whoops.

4910
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:33,540
Not bad.

4911
03:16:36,260 --> 03:16:36,780
Um...

4912
03:16:36,780 --> 03:16:38,040
We have...

4913
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:40,520
Uh...

4914
03:16:41,060 --> 03:16:41,580
Uh...

4915
03:16:42,520 --> 03:16:43,460
The clicker?

4916
03:16:43,720 --> 03:16:44,700
Will it work, you think?

4917
03:16:45,660 --> 03:16:46,340
Clicky click.

4918
03:16:46,640 --> 03:16:47,480
Let's try it.

4919
03:16:47,740 --> 03:16:48,260
Locked.

4920
03:16:48,340 --> 03:16:50,080
Oh my gosh, I just unlocked it, Nancy.

4921
03:16:50,440 --> 03:16:50,720
Please.

4922
03:16:51,880 --> 03:16:52,340
Oops.

4923
03:16:56,210 --> 03:16:57,010
Oh my god.

4924
03:16:57,170 --> 03:16:57,510
Turn around.

4925
03:16:58,110 --> 03:16:58,250
There.

4926
03:16:58,550 --> 03:16:58,770
Okay.

4927
03:17:02,220 --> 03:17:03,100
That's strange.

4928
03:17:03,380 --> 03:17:04,720
It's not working anymore.

4929
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:06,620
I should find another way in.

4930
03:17:06,780 --> 03:17:06,800
No.

4931
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:07,800
Not the clicker.

4932
03:17:08,760 --> 03:17:09,740
That's strange.

4933
03:17:10,040 --> 03:17:11,320
It's not working anymore.

4934
03:17:11,540 --> 03:17:13,280
I should find another way in.

4935
03:17:15,280 --> 03:17:16,420
What's the clicker?

4936
03:17:16,480 --> 03:17:17,200
I wish I could...

4937
03:17:17,200 --> 03:17:18,300
Look at it again.

4938
03:17:18,920 --> 03:17:20,020
I clicked too fast.

4939
03:17:23,720 --> 03:17:25,440
I wish I could observe it again.

4940
03:17:26,280 --> 03:17:27,160
Does it work for Suki?

4941
03:17:31,120 --> 03:17:31,560
Suki!

4942
03:17:33,860 --> 03:17:34,300
No.

4943
03:17:34,780 --> 03:17:36,480
I don't have time for this right now.

4944
03:17:41,140 --> 03:17:42,220
Try it from the hallway.

4945
03:17:44,280 --> 03:17:47,240
Yeah, I guess I can try it like on just the...

4946
03:17:47,760 --> 03:17:48,720
Door itself.

4947
03:17:48,980 --> 03:17:49,740
Oh wait, that's 35.

4948
03:17:51,580 --> 03:17:52,420
Let's see.

4949
03:17:53,660 --> 03:17:54,040
Oh!

4950
03:17:54,560 --> 03:17:55,440
It worked.

4951
03:17:55,780 --> 03:17:56,420
RUTARO!

4952
03:17:59,900 --> 03:18:01,680
What are you doing in here?

4953
03:18:01,900 --> 03:18:04,480
You're the one trying to scare everyone away, aren't you?

4954
03:18:04,660 --> 03:18:05,480
No, Nancy.

4955
03:18:05,860 --> 03:18:08,080
I'm not trying to scare everyone away.

4956
03:18:08,340 --> 03:18:10,820
I am scaring everyone away.

4957
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:11,960
Oh, I called it!

4958
03:18:12,180 --> 03:18:14,020
The Ryokan needs to close down.

4959
03:18:14,360 --> 03:18:16,820
But why would you want to close this place down?

4960
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:18,700
Look around you.

4961
03:18:19,100 --> 03:18:21,080
Does this look like a good place?

4962
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:23,200
Everyone can sense it immediately.

4963
03:18:23,620 --> 03:18:25,200
And it makes them leave.

4964
03:18:25,200 --> 03:18:26,880
Everyone but you.

4965
03:18:27,460 --> 03:18:34,260
But when I tell Miwako that you're here to collect info for Savannah's next book, you'll be out of here too.

4966
03:18:34,600 --> 03:18:34,740
No!

4967
03:18:35,240 --> 03:18:37,480
I've got to find a way to keep him from escaping.

4968
03:18:37,700 --> 03:18:38,100
Punch him!

4969
03:18:40,140 --> 03:18:40,680
Uh...

4970
03:18:41,090 --> 03:18:41,820
Knock him out!

4971
03:18:42,400 --> 03:18:42,880
Bonk!

4972
03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:44,380
Uh...

4973
03:18:44,380 --> 03:18:44,960
Cat egg.

4974
03:18:45,360 --> 03:18:45,800
WAAAH!

4975
03:18:46,240 --> 03:18:46,900
Oh my god.

4976
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:53,440
Okay.

4977
03:18:53,960 --> 03:18:54,940
It's just...

4978
03:18:54,940 --> 03:18:55,400
Okay.

4979
03:18:56,740 --> 03:18:59,000
I've got to find a way to keep him from escaping.

4980
03:19:00,700 --> 03:19:01,260
Okay.

4981
03:19:01,940 --> 03:19:02,500
Um...

4982
03:19:02,500 --> 03:19:02,760
This.

4983
03:19:04,180 --> 03:19:04,940
Play it.

4984
03:19:05,980 --> 03:19:06,840
Not now.

4985
03:19:07,100 --> 03:19:08,360
I've got to find Rentar...

4986
03:19:08,360 --> 03:19:09,440
He's in front of me!

4987
03:19:15,420 --> 03:19:15,980
Uh...

4988
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,520
I've got to find a way to keep him from escaping!

4989
03:19:20,920 --> 03:19:22,680
Um... Knock him out with the balls!

4990
03:19:24,960 --> 03:19:25,840
Uh... Puzzles!

4991
03:19:26,200 --> 03:19:26,820
Oh, oops.

4992
03:19:27,680 --> 03:19:28,600
I think he left.

4993
03:19:31,340 --> 03:19:32,220
Thank you!

4994
03:19:35,200 --> 03:19:36,500
Um... Close the door?

4995
03:19:36,840 --> 03:19:38,820
I've got to find a way to keep him from escaping!

4996
03:19:40,420 --> 03:19:42,160
No, that's not a viable option.

4997
03:19:43,320 --> 03:19:43,980
Oh, wait!

4998
03:19:44,140 --> 03:19:44,480
Clicker!

4999
03:19:45,980 --> 03:19:46,880
Not so fast!

5000
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:47,240
Yeah!

5001
03:19:47,800 --> 03:19:48,280
There we go.

5002
03:19:52,300 --> 03:19:55,040
I've got to find a way to convince everyone about Rintaro.

5003
03:19:55,280 --> 03:19:55,540
Quickly!

5004
03:19:55,840 --> 03:19:56,400
This one!

5005
03:19:57,780 --> 03:19:58,640
Play it!

5006
03:19:59,500 --> 03:20:00,720
I don't get it.

5007
03:20:00,880 --> 03:20:02,760
You're the one who told me the ghosts aren't real.

5008
03:20:03,140 --> 03:20:08,460
No one usually listens to that line because they want to believe in the ghosts.

5009
03:20:08,940 --> 03:20:10,380
I didn't start that.

5010
03:20:10,700 --> 03:20:11,280
They did.

5011
03:20:11,280 --> 03:20:16,280
They wanted a show and I gave it to them because enough with them!

5012
03:20:16,720 --> 03:20:17,940
And enough of this place!

5013
03:20:19,540 --> 03:20:21,920
I asked Miwako to leave.

5014
03:20:22,480 --> 03:20:24,160
I even left myself.

5015
03:20:24,860 --> 03:20:26,460
Why did you come back?

5016
03:20:26,460 --> 03:20:28,620
I can't leave Miwako here alone.

5017
03:20:29,300 --> 03:20:32,480
I need to convince her to leave or close this place down.

5018
03:20:33,380 --> 03:20:34,660
It doesn't matter to me.

5019
03:20:35,620 --> 03:20:36,640
But you!

5020
03:20:37,380 --> 03:20:39,140
It's time that you leave!

5021
03:20:39,480 --> 03:20:39,820
Now!

5022
03:20:39,820 --> 03:20:42,220
This feels like Ace Attorney, like timed Ace Attorney.

5023
03:20:42,220 --> 03:20:42,220
Look familiar?

5024
03:20:42,480 --> 03:20:43,860
It's been on this whole time.

5025
03:20:44,100 --> 03:20:48,900
I just push this button and I'll send everything you've said to every voicemail box in the place.

5026
03:20:49,440 --> 03:20:49,920
No!

5027
03:20:50,980 --> 03:20:51,460
Don't!

5028
03:20:51,560 --> 03:20:52,200
Oh my god, do it!

5029
03:20:52,680 --> 03:20:53,520
Why shouldn't I?

5030
03:20:53,660 --> 03:20:57,000
After everything you've done, your ghost almost drowned me!

5031
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:57,140
Yeah!

5032
03:20:58,260 --> 03:20:59,140
Attempted murder!

5033
03:20:59,840 --> 03:21:01,640
Let me be the one to tell her.

5034
03:21:02,060 --> 03:21:04,680
If I do, she might forgive me.

5035
03:21:04,760 --> 03:21:05,320
Do it, Nancy.

5036
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:05,860
Do it!

5037
03:21:06,300 --> 03:21:06,320
Eventually.

5038
03:21:06,740 --> 03:21:06,880
No.

5039
03:21:15,290 --> 03:21:15,810
Um...

5040
03:21:15,810 --> 03:21:17,510
Not a chance, Rantaro.

5041
03:21:21,030 --> 03:21:21,790
All right.

5042
03:21:22,130 --> 03:21:24,190
I don't want to be here when you tell her.

5043
03:21:24,970 --> 03:21:26,010
You coward!

5044
03:21:26,390 --> 03:21:30,450
Dear Hana, Rantaro left and never returned to the Ryokan.

5045
03:21:30,810 --> 03:21:32,930
To this day, no one knows where he went.

5046
03:21:33,270 --> 03:21:38,670
When I told Miwako and Takai what he'd been up to, they were furious and relieved.

5047
03:21:38,670 --> 03:21:45,510
After living in the shadow of Rantaro's hauntings for so long, they were finally able to feel at home again in the Ryokan.

5048
03:21:45,990 --> 03:21:51,770
Once the girls found out Kasumi's true wishes, everyone agreed that the Ryokan should be passed on to Miwako.

5049
03:21:52,250 --> 03:21:53,790
Miwako accepted the position.

5050
03:21:53,950 --> 03:21:57,270
As the official owner, she started to really enjoy her work.

5051
03:21:57,430 --> 03:21:58,250
And it shows.

5052
03:21:58,550 --> 03:22:03,590
Now that there's no pressure to take over the family business, Yumi's been spending more time at the inn.

5053
03:22:03,830 --> 03:22:07,850
She's even agreed to expand her business to include catering to the Ryokan.

5054
03:22:08,670 --> 03:22:13,190
Thanks to Yumi's incessant pushing, Miwako finally agreed to spend a little time in the city.

5055
03:22:13,470 --> 03:22:15,790
From the looks of it, she had a great time.

5056
03:22:16,230 --> 03:22:18,410
She got her sister to start gambling!

5057
03:22:18,870 --> 03:22:20,850
Takai is finding herself busier than ever.

5058
03:22:21,210 --> 03:22:24,670
Her classes in the traditional arts are booked for months in advance.

5059
03:22:24,970 --> 03:22:30,070
She said she'd always fit me in for a calligraphy lesson, even if it may be a bit of a lost cause.

5060
03:22:30,510 --> 03:22:34,670
From what I hear, the Ryokan's no longer the creepy place I remember.

5061
03:22:35,270 --> 03:22:37,250
Customers are returning with a vengeance.

5062
03:22:37,750 --> 03:22:41,510
Guess that means it'll be harder for me to get reservations next time I visit.

5063
03:22:41,750 --> 03:22:45,850
As for me, I finally got to spend some time in the town with Bess and George.

5064
03:22:46,130 --> 03:22:47,430
And it was worth the wait.

5065
03:22:48,110 --> 03:22:48,570
Nancy?!

5066
03:22:50,750 --> 03:22:53,790
I don't think we've ever had so much fun on the trip.

5067
03:22:54,190 --> 03:22:54,830
See you soon!

5068
03:22:55,250 --> 03:22:56,070
Love, Nancy!

5069
03:22:57,610 --> 03:22:58,470
Yeah, oh!

5070
03:22:59,050 --> 03:23:01,290
Who is not a guest at the Ryokan?

5071
03:23:01,450 --> 03:23:02,330
Oh my god, no way!

5072
03:23:02,450 --> 03:23:03,490
I'm getting quiz now!

5073
03:23:05,270 --> 03:23:07,570
There's a- there's a quiz at the end!

5074
03:23:08,310 --> 03:23:08,530
Oh!

5075
03:23:12,650 --> 03:23:13,430
Pop quiz!

5076
03:23:16,180 --> 03:23:17,560
I have no idea!

5077
03:23:23,800 --> 03:23:26,600
Cat Whisperer for taming the wild beast.

5078
03:23:27,620 --> 03:23:28,600
Easter egg!

5079
03:23:28,940 --> 03:23:31,440
Fashion designer for sharing your costume designs with the world.

5080
03:23:31,900 --> 03:23:34,000
Mystery seeker for watching eerie footage.

5081
03:23:34,420 --> 03:23:38,240
Password pilferer for returning borrowed goods to their rightful home.

5082
03:23:38,540 --> 03:23:40,100
Oh, I could've put it back!

5083
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:42,500
Puzzle Pro for solving all of Ren's puzzles.

5084
03:23:42,820 --> 03:23:45,380
Recording artist for listening to the world around you.

5085
03:23:47,260 --> 03:23:49,560
Souschef for mastering the art of bento.

5086
03:23:49,900 --> 03:23:51,760
Souvenir searcher for getting all the prizes.

5087
03:23:52,580 --> 03:23:55,140
Squeaky Clean for enjoying the- I did go to the bath!

5088
03:23:56,480 --> 03:23:58,040
Mint is not over yet!

5089
03:23:58,300 --> 03:23:58,560
Mint!

5090
03:24:01,040 --> 03:24:05,340
Ren Taro would go on to develop video games about Cold War Mecha MVL.

5091
03:24:07,660 --> 03:24:11,300
Teacher's pet for making sure your jo- I did all the- No, no, no!

5092
03:24:11,420 --> 03:24:13,100
I did- I graded the homework!

5093
03:24:13,980 --> 03:24:15,080
Maybe I missed one day.

5094
03:24:15,560 --> 03:24:18,000
Trivia tamer for correctly answering the trivia question.

5095
03:24:18,300 --> 03:24:18,580
Oh!

5096
03:24:19,160 --> 03:24:19,880
Let's go!

5097
03:24:20,480 --> 03:24:24,760
Residents of a German castle are being terrorized by a fearsome creature.

5098
03:24:24,820 --> 03:24:25,280
We got a trailer for next game.

5099
03:24:25,280 --> 03:24:27,460
And it's up to me to crack the case.

5100
03:24:30,260 --> 03:24:32,320
To where grandma thought she was from, Germany.

5101
03:24:32,320 --> 03:24:36,760
I begin to suspect that there may be more to this monster story than just superstition.

5102
03:24:37,060 --> 03:24:46,100
As monster sightings become more frequent and creepy signs begin appearing, I find myself in danger of becoming the monster's next victim.

5103
03:24:46,520 --> 03:24:53,980
Join me as I try to solve the case without becoming another entry in the castle's long and grisly history.

5104
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:58,100
In my next adventure, the captive curse.

5105
03:25:00,160 --> 03:25:00,680
Oooooooohhhhhh.

5106
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:01,220
Hahahaha.

5107
03:25:03,320 --> 03:25:04,360
Senior detective!

5108
03:25:05,180 --> 03:25:07,320
Wait, why am I missing 3 stars?

5109
03:25:07,900 --> 03:25:08,620
Oh wait!

5110
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:10,480
No, I think I only got 3 stars.

5111
03:25:10,900 --> 03:25:15,100
Yeah, because I did 3- I got 3 achievements.

5112
03:25:15,820 --> 03:25:18,620
We have to listen to this stinking song one more time.

5113
03:25:18,620 --> 03:25:20,320
Oh my goodness.

5114
03:25:24,700 --> 03:25:26,320
I don't think that was the bad end.

5115
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:30,420
Hold on, I'm gonna load... okay, load this.

5116
03:25:33,340 --> 03:25:34,820
Let's see what we get for the other ending.

5117
03:25:43,540 --> 03:25:45,920
But also, there's the...

5118
03:25:45,920 --> 03:25:46,820
Enough with them!

5119
03:25:47,280 --> 03:25:48,040
And enough of this place!

5120
03:25:48,040 --> 03:25:48,920
If we accuse the grandma...

5121
03:25:55,580 --> 03:25:58,160
Yeah, the accused grandma ending.

5122
03:25:58,940 --> 03:26:00,120
Yeah, I wanna try that.

5123
03:26:06,260 --> 03:26:07,220
But you!

5124
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:09,840
It's time that you leave.

5125
03:26:10,400 --> 03:26:10,820
Now!

5126
03:26:14,360 --> 03:26:21,560
The fact that this game has, like, such expressive models, though, is really impressive.

5127
03:26:22,800 --> 03:26:28,460
They could've really cheaped out, but they didn't.

5128
03:26:37,220 --> 03:26:37,740
Eventually.

5129
03:26:38,300 --> 03:26:39,240
Um, okay.

5130
03:26:39,580 --> 03:26:40,580
But I'll be watching.

5131
03:26:40,860 --> 03:26:41,200
Okay!

5132
03:26:41,520 --> 03:26:42,580
But I'll be watching!

5133
03:26:42,760 --> 03:26:43,360
Let's see what happens.

5134
03:26:43,360 --> 03:26:43,940
You better do it!

5135
03:26:49,430 --> 03:26:50,410
Thanks, Nancy.

5136
03:26:52,810 --> 03:26:55,050
This is going to be terrible, isn't it?

5137
03:26:56,930 --> 03:26:57,450
Okay.

5138
03:26:57,990 --> 03:26:58,150
Yep.

5139
03:26:59,350 --> 03:27:01,110
He's gonna run away like the weenie here.

5140
03:27:01,390 --> 03:27:01,590
There he is.

5141
03:27:02,150 --> 03:27:02,170
Oh!

5142
03:27:04,650 --> 03:27:05,210
Oh!

5143
03:27:05,210 --> 03:27:07,690
On the bridge!

5144
03:27:07,910 --> 03:27:15,530
After many months of apologizing and begging, Mawako agreed to allow Rintaro to undo some of the damage he'd done to the Ryukon's reputation.

5145
03:27:15,850 --> 03:27:21,070
Instead of scaring away guests, Rintaro was using his skills to modernize the Ryukon.

5146
03:27:21,210 --> 03:27:23,510
In small, Takai-approved ways.

5147
03:27:23,770 --> 03:27:24,450
Okay, like what?

5148
03:27:24,450 --> 03:27:26,810
Mawako broke up with Rintaro after he confessed.

5149
03:27:26,810 --> 03:27:27,330
Yeah!

5150
03:27:27,670 --> 03:27:29,730
He's hopeful that one day, she'll change her mind.

5151
03:27:29,930 --> 03:27:30,070
Yeah!

5152
03:27:30,190 --> 03:27:32,070
He wouldn't hold my breath if I were him.

5153
03:27:32,990 --> 03:27:34,470
Value yourself, Mawako!

5154
03:27:35,150 --> 03:27:38,510
Everyone agreed that the Ryukon should be passed on to Mawako.

5155
03:27:38,610 --> 03:27:38,650
Happy ending.

5156
03:27:38,990 --> 03:27:40,470
Mawako accepted the position.

5157
03:27:40,690 --> 03:27:43,970
As the official owner, she started to really enjoy her work.

5158
03:27:44,090 --> 03:27:44,830
And it shows.

5159
03:27:45,210 --> 03:27:45,470
Happy ending.

5160
03:27:45,510 --> 03:27:50,230
Now that there's no pressure to take over the family business, Yumi's been spending more time at the inn.

5161
03:27:50,490 --> 03:27:54,490
She's even agreed to expand her business to include catering to the Ryukon.

5162
03:27:54,490 --> 03:27:55,890
I think it's pretty funny, though, that...

5163
03:27:55,890 --> 03:27:58,590
Thanks to Yumi's incessant pushing, Mawako finally agreed to spend a little time in the city.

5164
03:27:58,590 --> 03:28:02,430
The other ending just has them, like, oust Rintaro forever.

5165
03:28:02,730 --> 03:28:05,270
I think it's pretty funny.

5166
03:28:05,410 --> 03:28:07,490
Takai is finding herself busier than ever.

5167
03:28:07,690 --> 03:28:11,330
Her classes in the traditional arts are booked for months in advance.

5168
03:28:11,590 --> 03:28:14,310
She said she'd always fit me in for a calligraphy lesson.

5169
03:28:14,730 --> 03:28:15,510
Even if it may be a bit of a lost cause.

5170
03:28:15,510 --> 03:28:16,430
I think the rest is all the same.

5171
03:28:17,010 --> 03:28:20,510
From what I hear, the Ryukon's no longer the creepy...

5172
03:28:20,510 --> 03:28:21,530
Yeah, I think this is all the same.

5173
03:28:22,150 --> 03:28:24,370
So, what I'm gonna do...

5174
03:28:25,410 --> 03:28:26,450
Is, um...

5175
03:28:26,450 --> 03:28:28,410
Let's go back to the grandma ending.

5176
03:28:30,090 --> 03:28:31,130
Which was...

5177
03:28:31,130 --> 03:28:32,210
This one.

5178
03:28:33,170 --> 03:28:34,830
This one we're gonna go back to.

5179
03:28:36,850 --> 03:28:37,890
And, uh...

5180
03:28:37,890 --> 03:28:38,910
See if this changes it.

5181
03:28:38,910 --> 03:28:40,690
I would never do that.

5182
03:28:40,930 --> 03:28:45,250
So let's see if we accuse the grandma and say you were the one causing the hauntings.

5183
03:28:45,470 --> 03:28:46,630
Then if that changes.

5184
03:28:46,630 --> 03:28:47,670
I don't believe you.

5185
03:28:47,950 --> 03:28:48,930
You must.

5186
03:28:49,790 --> 03:28:50,090
You must.

5187
03:28:50,090 --> 03:28:50,930
Kasumi was...

5188
03:28:50,930 --> 03:28:51,930
So...

5189
03:28:51,930 --> 03:28:53,130
Special to me.

5190
03:28:53,430 --> 03:28:56,730
I would never use her memory that way.

5191
03:28:57,170 --> 03:28:57,670
Never.

5192
03:28:58,490 --> 03:28:59,250
Oh!

5193
03:28:59,690 --> 03:29:00,530
Nevermind.

5194
03:29:01,430 --> 03:29:02,330
I literally did nothing.

5195
03:29:05,130 --> 03:29:05,970
Okay.

5196
03:29:06,770 --> 03:29:07,610
Uh...

5197
03:29:07,610 --> 03:29:08,630
Nevermind.

5198
03:29:15,070 --> 03:29:15,750
Okay.

5199
03:29:19,270 --> 03:29:19,950
Special.

5200
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:20,810
Special.

5201
03:29:22,430 --> 03:29:24,270
I think that was everything.

5202
03:29:25,590 --> 03:29:26,910
I think we did it.

5203
03:29:27,050 --> 03:29:28,170
I think we solved the mystery.

5204
03:29:29,370 --> 03:29:30,050
And...

5205
03:29:30,050 --> 03:29:30,510
Yeah!

5206
03:29:31,590 --> 03:29:32,030
Wait.

5207
03:29:32,390 --> 03:29:33,890
There is one last mystery.

5208
03:29:34,730 --> 03:29:37,030
Did I grade all the homework?

5209
03:29:37,430 --> 03:29:37,790
Wait.

5210
03:29:38,250 --> 03:29:38,310
Oh.

5211
03:29:38,530 --> 03:29:38,630
My bad.

5212
03:29:39,190 --> 03:29:40,290
Did I grade all the homework?

5213
03:29:40,550 --> 03:29:41,390
I must know.

5214
03:29:41,630 --> 03:29:42,630
I must know.

5215
03:29:43,930 --> 03:29:44,930
Grading time!

5216
03:29:45,090 --> 03:29:45,790
Oh my god!

5217
03:29:48,970 --> 03:29:49,610
Sakura.

5218
03:29:50,050 --> 03:29:50,750
How you be?

5219
03:29:51,550 --> 03:29:52,690
I be happy.

5220
03:29:54,210 --> 03:29:55,250
What you do?

5221
03:29:55,790 --> 03:29:56,990
I learn English.

5222
03:29:59,630 --> 03:29:59,950
Next.

5223
03:30:01,130 --> 03:30:01,470
Aime.

5224
03:30:02,170 --> 03:30:03,330
How's are you?

5225
03:30:03,890 --> 03:30:04,270
Aww.

5226
03:30:05,190 --> 03:30:06,530
I am egg-cited.

5227
03:30:06,670 --> 03:30:07,050
Oh!

5228
03:30:07,270 --> 03:30:07,710
Eggie!

5229
03:30:08,590 --> 03:30:09,010
Woohoo!

5230
03:30:09,910 --> 03:30:10,630
Why you doing?

5231
03:30:11,330 --> 03:30:13,050
Why you doing, B-Tuber?

5232
03:30:13,550 --> 03:30:14,110
Sad.

5233
03:30:14,650 --> 03:30:15,690
I'm learning English.

5234
03:30:17,150 --> 03:30:17,770
Fumiko.

5235
03:30:18,010 --> 03:30:18,590
How are you?

5236
03:30:18,790 --> 03:30:19,510
I'm well.

5237
03:30:19,850 --> 03:30:20,910
What are you doing?

5238
03:30:21,170 --> 03:30:22,670
I am learning English.

5239
03:30:23,170 --> 03:30:24,390
Our genius, Fumiko.

5240
03:30:24,610 --> 03:30:26,350
You get gold stars across the board, baby.

5241
03:30:27,430 --> 03:30:27,930
Kenta.

5242
03:30:28,210 --> 03:30:28,910
You are how?

5243
03:30:29,230 --> 03:30:30,110
I is good.

5244
03:30:30,390 --> 03:30:31,210
What do you?

5245
03:30:31,550 --> 03:30:32,670
English learning.

5246
03:30:32,670 --> 03:30:32,770
That's disgusting.

5247
03:30:36,430 --> 03:30:37,490
How are you?

5248
03:30:37,730 --> 03:30:38,850
I am fined.

5249
03:30:39,990 --> 03:30:40,910
What happened?

5250
03:30:41,690 --> 03:30:42,750
I be learned English.

5251
03:30:45,130 --> 03:30:45,910
All done.

5252
03:30:56,450 --> 03:30:57,370
I don't want to go.

5253
03:30:57,490 --> 03:31:00,010
I wish I could skip like the dialogue.

5254
03:31:00,010 --> 03:31:02,090
The dialogue, but that is not the case.

5255
03:31:02,410 --> 03:31:10,850
So, we'll just finish here on the balcony of the beautiful Ryokan that we have all to ourselves.

5256
03:31:11,250 --> 03:31:12,830
Because everybody else is gone.

5257
03:31:16,750 --> 03:31:18,150
And we know it's not haunted.

5258
03:31:19,190 --> 03:31:21,210
It was just Ventaro because he sucks.

5259
03:31:21,530 --> 03:31:22,670
Try Princess, thank you!

5260
03:31:24,190 --> 03:31:28,090
Guys, I have another stream in about an hour and a half.

5261
03:31:28,230 --> 03:31:29,130
So I'm going to go eat.

5262
03:31:29,430 --> 03:31:30,290
Great job solving the case.

5263
03:31:30,290 --> 03:31:32,330
Personally, I thought Savannah was the best character.

5264
03:31:32,530 --> 03:31:33,210
Thanks for the game.

5265
03:31:33,290 --> 03:31:33,730
Thank you!

5266
03:31:34,050 --> 03:31:34,890
Thank you!

5267
03:31:35,290 --> 03:31:38,890
If interested in exploring more in the Ancestrian series, I recommend...

5268
03:31:39,990 --> 03:31:44,270
I recommend warnings at Waverly Academy for streamability.

5269
03:31:44,730 --> 03:31:45,550
Oh, thank you!

5270
03:31:45,770 --> 03:31:46,570
I appreciate it.

5271
03:31:47,650 --> 03:31:49,010
Thank you so much for the pink!

5272
03:31:49,870 --> 03:31:50,930
Are you VTuber?

5273
03:31:53,170 --> 03:31:53,750
Yeah.

5274
03:31:54,330 --> 03:31:54,910
Yippee!

5275
03:31:56,810 --> 03:31:58,290
Well, I hope you guys enjoyed...

5276
03:31:58,290 --> 03:32:03,990
I enjoyed the ending of Nancy Drew's shadow at the water's edge.

5277
03:32:04,430 --> 03:32:05,710
And this was a lot of fun.

5278
03:32:05,870 --> 03:32:09,110
Oh gosh, we wouldn't have been able to finish this yesterday for sure.

5279
03:32:10,470 --> 03:32:11,830
But I'm going to go eat.

5280
03:32:12,510 --> 03:32:14,590
And then if I see you...

5281
03:32:14,590 --> 03:32:15,130
Oh, let me...

5282
03:32:15,130 --> 03:32:16,830
I guess I can raid us into...

5283
03:32:16,830 --> 03:32:17,230
Um...

5284
03:32:17,750 --> 03:32:18,650
The next stream.

5285
03:32:19,870 --> 03:32:21,550
If she has a...

5286
03:32:22,270 --> 03:32:23,490
Ha-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

5287
03:32:23,710 --> 03:32:24,830
Ha-pa-pa-pa.

5288
03:32:25,130 --> 03:32:25,670
Ha-pa-pa-pa.

5289
03:32:25,670 --> 03:32:25,990
Ha-pa-pa-pa.

5290
03:32:26,450 --> 03:32:27,790
A waiting room up.

5291
03:32:29,410 --> 03:32:30,230
Doki Bird.

5292
03:32:30,470 --> 03:32:31,030
She does!

5293
03:32:31,230 --> 03:32:31,550
Okay, cool.

5294
03:32:39,070 --> 03:32:40,370
Thank you guys.

5295
03:32:40,550 --> 03:32:41,810
Thanks for all the help too.

5296
03:32:42,430 --> 03:32:43,590
Thank you for all the help.

5297
03:32:43,730 --> 03:32:45,950
Some of the puzzles my brain does not...

5298
03:32:45,950 --> 03:32:47,230
Does not comprehend.

5299
03:32:47,810 --> 03:32:51,410
And some puzzles, aka nanograms, my brain comprehends.

5300
03:32:53,670 --> 03:32:54,610
Thank you guys.

5301
03:32:54,810 --> 03:32:55,890
Happy thing, thank you!

5302
03:32:57,570 --> 03:32:58,970
I hope you play more games.

5303
03:32:59,110 --> 03:32:59,690
Thank you so much!

5304
03:32:59,830 --> 03:33:00,910
Thank you for all the Super Chats!

5305
03:33:01,030 --> 03:33:01,890
Thank you so much!

5306
03:33:02,010 --> 03:33:02,550
Thank you, thank you!

5307
03:33:02,650 --> 03:33:07,590
Sorry, I feel like you sent so many and then, I was like I'm sorry, I can't read it because I'm doing an Italian thing!

5308
03:33:08,110 --> 03:33:09,150
Thank you though, thank you!

5309
03:33:09,250 --> 03:33:09,870
More in on!

5310
03:33:10,550 --> 03:33:12,630
Thanks, and thank you for playing one of my favorite game series!

5311
03:33:12,750 --> 03:33:14,490
Is that a meeting, Is that a meeting?!

5312
03:33:17,090 --> 03:33:18,470
Congrats on the 25 by 25.

5313
03:33:18,610 --> 03:33:18,930
Yeah!

5314
03:33:19,490 --> 03:33:24,310
You guys saw me solve my first ever 25 by 25 nanogram.

5315
03:33:25,710 --> 03:33:26,070
Nonogram.

5316
03:33:27,550 --> 03:33:28,350
I need food.

5317
03:33:28,650 --> 03:33:28,790
Okay.

5318
03:33:29,130 --> 03:33:29,810
You're pretty good.

5319
03:33:29,990 --> 03:33:31,150
Oh, you is pretty good.

5320
03:33:33,210 --> 03:33:34,010
Thank you, Shine.

5321
03:33:34,210 --> 03:33:34,790
Thank you.

5322
03:33:35,730 --> 03:33:36,230
It's all right.

5323
03:33:36,330 --> 03:33:36,930
Don't worry about it.

5324
03:33:37,010 --> 03:33:37,590
Thank you.

5325
03:33:38,630 --> 03:33:38,990
Atsumito.

5326
03:33:39,670 --> 03:33:40,370
Atsu, atsu, atsu.

5327
03:33:41,230 --> 03:33:41,730
Itte rasha.

5328
03:33:41,810 --> 03:33:42,270
Have a good day.

5329
03:33:42,370 --> 03:33:42,670
Have a good night.

5330
03:33:42,770 --> 03:33:44,010
If I see you later, I'll see you later.

5331
03:33:44,130 --> 03:33:44,470
And if not...

5332
03:33:44,470 --> 03:33:46,870
But... I'll see you when I see you.

5333
03:33:47,490 --> 03:33:54,350
Buh-bye-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-
