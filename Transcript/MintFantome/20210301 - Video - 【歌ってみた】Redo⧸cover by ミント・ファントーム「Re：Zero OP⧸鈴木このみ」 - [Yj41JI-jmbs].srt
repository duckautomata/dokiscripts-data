1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:01:00,020
自分の中に囚われ迷って そうじゃないよと言い聞かせて 全てを自由に擦れるかなんて わからないよと空を霞んで 全てを自由に擦れるかなんて わからないよと空を霞んで A little pause... and we are back.

2
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:16,500
A little pause... and we are back.

3
00:01:33,360 --> 00:02:00,020
A little pause...

4
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,020
and we are back.

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,820
A little pause... and we are back.

6
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,480
A little pause...

7
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,480
and we are back.

8
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,640
I will fight against fate.

9
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,020
I will fight against fate.

10
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,400
I will fight against fate.

11
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,720
I won't give up!

12
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,680
The stone I was tied to is not a struggle, but strength.

13
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,000
The stone I was tied to is not a struggle, but strength.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,300
I will search for it.

15
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,940
The eyes I found will turn food into reality.

16
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,520
The world is for you.

17
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,820
It's the first time.

18
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,900
The memories I held in my heart will continue from that day on.

19
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,320
I can fly.

20
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,160
Brain-2!

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,320
Brain-2!

22
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,380
Brain-3!

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,120
Brain-4 and Brain-3 make a thousand lives.

24
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,300
Can't you give up?!

25
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:30,280
This is the next organisation.

26
00:03:30,280 --> 00:04:02,090
A little pause... and we are back.

27
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:14,090
A little pause... and we are back.
