1
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,520
Whoa!

2
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Whoa!

3
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,180
Whoa!

4
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,860
Oh, I forgot to start the game!

5
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,440
Wait!

6
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

7
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,820
I forgot to start the game!

8
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

9
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,880
There is...

10
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,420
Oh, Kairi Dasaiimasu!

11
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,460
Goshunjin Japan!

12
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,380
It's a must!

13
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,930
Hello, hello, hello!

14
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,410
Hi, hi, hi!

15
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,490
We're here to...

16
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,530
to...

17
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,910
Gamble, baby!

18
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,450
We're here to gamble, gamble.

19
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,250
Nice shades.

20
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,810
Thank you.

21
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,930
I thought this is what you would wear in Vegas.

22
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,010
Thought this is what you would wear in Vegas.

23
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,630
So I thought maybe it, uh...

24
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,570
Why are people saying hashtag free Nimi?

25
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,310
Huh?

26
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,280
Is it because of her stream?

27
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
I was watching right before this.

28
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,340
Did her stream get taken down again?

29
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,780
I saw like her stream went suspended or something.

30
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,260
I love gambling.

31
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,720
I love putting all my money on the line.

32
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,400
I'm going to win it all.

33
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,420
Oh, speaking of Nimi, I will be on her stream tomorrow for her birthday.

34
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
So, yeah.

36
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,340
Maybe I can, like, raid into that waiting room or something.

37
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,380
So I'll be there tomorrow!

38
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,680
Yeah!

39
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,600
But today, we're playing Clover Pit.

41
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
I want to gamble.

42
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,920
I forgot to watch Kiwawa's Vod.

43
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,680
But she said that she got really, really far.

44
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,780
So I want to.

45
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,240
I have three job interviews.

46
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,120
Can I get a big old minky?

47
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,380
Good luck from you and the wisps.

48
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,440
Joshua!

49
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,900
Good.

50
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,100
Luck!

51
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,980
I'm enjoying some chicken tenders.

52
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,480
Who said you could sleep this much?

53
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,240
All right.

54
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,360
We're back in it, baby.

55
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,300
We're back in it, baby.

56
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,920
We're back in it, baby!

57
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,890
I'm ready.

58
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,290
I'm ready...

59
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,370
To lose it all!

60
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,750
Or...

61
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,330
Well, I guess I was gonna say die trying.

62
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,310
They can't get me, I'm already dead.

63
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,210
So, what do we have to start with?

65
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,990
So this is my second run, everybody.

66
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,050
This is my...

67
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,810
Oh, we can get another key!

68
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,070
This is my second run.

69
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,350
I forgot, there was a body part in here, but I don't remember what it was.

70
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,970
If this piece is inside, a drawer at the end of any deadline discarded.

71
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,790
What do they mean by that?

72
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,870
It's discarded.

73
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,390
Like, throw it away.

74
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,070
I know what it means, but like...

75
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,370
Why don't I throw it away right now?

76
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,490
Oh, am I kind of big?

77
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:49,870
Hold on.

78
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,730
Let me shrink my head like a tad.

79
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,410
There we go.

80
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,150
You can basically ignore it.

81
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,750
Okay, okay.

82
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,630
We got our lucky cat, we got our golden treasure, we got our stonks!

83
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,670
Wait, I kind of want to take a lucky cat and the stonks already.

84
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,190
I wish I could do more.

85
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,330
I wish I could get more!

86
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,250
Yeah, I don't want more dirt.

87
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,870
I don't want it.

88
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,730
Rotated hamsa.

89
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,750
Hamsa.

90
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,570
What does it do?

91
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,510
Grand luck plus seven for the last spin of a round.

92
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,770
I can't...

93
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,530
Someone said take it.

94
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,450
I can't even take it.

95
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,510
I don't have three.

96
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,010
But I want the lucky cat.

97
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,750
I don't know which...

98
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:40,890
Wait.

99
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,250
Whenever three plus patterns trigger during a spin, you earn money, you go to your current address.

100
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,770
I should go...

101
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,890
I hope I get the stonks.

102
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,230
Welcome to the Gumbach Coffin.

103
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,390
Spooky number for spooky month!

104
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:54,870
Yeah!

105
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,970
What are we chasing today?

106
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,630
We're chasing the thrill, baby!

107
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,990
It doesn't matter!

108
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,130
Win or lose!

109
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,470
I want it all!

110
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,130
I want that... I want that feeling in the pit of my stomach.

111
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,770
I want it there, baby!

112
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,710
Yeah!

113
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,020
Um...

114
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,270
I'm gonna take the stonks, everybody.

115
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,410
I think I will invest in stonks for the first time in my afterlife?

116
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,170
Oh, what a thrill.

117
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,610
I think I will.

118
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,510
Take the stonks.

119
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,050
Yes, yes.

120
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,950
Higher stonks.

121
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,790
Higher stonks.

122
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,010
Then we'll...

123
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,390
I guess I'll just start.

124
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,030
What's our...

125
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,590
What's our...

126
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,590
Debt is 75?

127
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,290
Oh, we got this.

128
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,150
We got this.

129
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,470
We got this.

130
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,050
We got this.

131
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,830
Let's just...

132
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,450
Oh, yeah, boy.

133
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,250
So far so good.

134
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,510
Oh!

135
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,290
Oh!

136
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,810
Best way to play this is to blast 777 by silk sonic and start cranking that lever.

137
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,570
We're gambling.

138
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:22,700
Three!

139
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:24,980
Bing!

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,280
Wait, now I can get...

141
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,200
Now I can get the cat.

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:31,860
Uh.

143
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,250
Nice.

144
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,830
Let's go gambling.

145
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,190
Let's go gambling.

146
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,250
Yeah, you guys can't remember.

147
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,940
How old?

148
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,880
The luckiest ever!

149
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,460
Wait, would that have been...

150
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,020
How do I get a jackpot?

151
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
It was my birthday yesterday.

152
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,460
Happy birthday!

153
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,000
Happy birthday to you!

154
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,820
Happy birthday to you!

155
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,220
Happy birthday dear Fudge Tart!

156
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,320
Happy birthday to you!

157
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,400
Happy birthday!

158
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,700
What

159
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,520
should we aim for?

160
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,580
Why should we go for you guys this time?

161
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,480
Wait, how did I get three spans?

162
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,540
None of that happened.

163
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
Where'd those come from?

164
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm making money here, please!

165
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,680
Oh, oops!

166
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,260
Oh, I didn't realize, I saw the crown and I was like, what's that mean?

167
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,520
Oopsie.

168
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,580
Oopsie, poopsie.

169
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,150
By the way, the cost to play the slot machine, yeah, yeah, yeah, we know, we know, we know.

170
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,090
We know, we know how this works.

171
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,170
this works.

172
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,470
And if you don't, if this is your first time watching how this works, you'll know how this works.

173
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,690
You'll know, you'll know, you'll know.

174
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,770
Oh, let's see.

175
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,630
We could go for Clovers and Bells.

176
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,780
Or we could go for Diamonds.

177
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,900
I don't know the diamonds.

178
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,700
I don't have a good history with those.

179
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,940
I don't have a good history with those.

180
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,720
Why do you guys always say in lemons?

181
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,480
Everybody's always telling me to do lemons.

182
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,100
Is there something special about the lemons?

183
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,160
I mean, I do love a good lemon.

184
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,840
I'll eat those whole...

185
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,620
Go jackpot.

186
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,540
Lemons.

187
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,940
They're yummy.

188
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,800
Yeah, they are.

189
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,040
I love lemons.

190
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,580
But I heard they're not good for your teeth.

191
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,700
Maybe that's why I have no teeth right now.

192
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,640
I hate too many lemons.

193
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,860
Sinclair, thank you so much for the tech gifted.

194
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,360
Thank you.

195
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,300
I got one tooth.

196
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't be like me.

197
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,860
I hate too many lemons.

198
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,980
You'll end up with one tooth.

199
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,860
Please allow that goo.

200
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,820
Well, one old tooth.

201
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,260
This is what they call them, lemon mine.

202
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,240
It's my birthday!

203
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,600
It's my birthday!

204
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,560
Happy birthday!

205
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,720
Happy birthday to you!

206
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,760
Happy birthday to you!

207
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,720
Happy birthday to you!

208
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,080
Happy birthday to you!

209
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,900
Happy birthday!

210
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,560
Happy birthday to you!

211
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Happy birthday!

212
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,940
I don't know, I'm feeling lucky!

213
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm gonna go with this one because it says I'm feeling lucky.

214
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,160
You are really Wait, you...

215
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,080
I'm delusional?

216
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,760
Then I don't want to be insane.

217
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,680
If I'm delusional...

218
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
Wait, we could get cat food for our cat.

219
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:36,980
Oh, wait!

220
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,080
Clovers manifest more often.

221
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,460
Wait, this one would be huge with what we just got, no?

222
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,730
Wait, this one's legendary.

223
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,950
All lucky charms triggered by the red button triggered one more time, but I don't have any with the button.

224
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,550
This one is the button.

225
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,030
Hmm.

226
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,890
Clover build, maybe, perhaps.

227
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,890
Increases interest.

228
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,090
Do we want to...

229
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,470
Wait, but decreases by 3% after every round.

230
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,190
I feel like Grandma's purse is probably good to get later, no?

231
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,090
You want the...

232
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,470
Or wait.

233
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,990
It increases the interest, but it doesn't go back down, right?

234
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,110
Or does it...

235
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,410
Wait, but decreases by 3% after every round.

236
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,070
Our interest is not so great.

237
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,210
right now.

238
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,410
It would be better for later.

239
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,830
Yeah, 15%.

240
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,970
Yeah, it would go down, so.

241
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,730
To spam jackpot, you need to get your luck to 15 above your spin.

242
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,890
Each spot on the slot is one.

243
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,910
Wait.

244
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,770
So, like, these have to be 15?

245
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,670
Wait, I don't have anything for the...

246
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,330
Oh, duh.

247
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,830
I just bought the... I'm stupid.

248
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,610
I was like, I don't have anything for the butt.

249
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,150
Okay, let's spin.

250
00:15:59,330 --> 00:15:59,730
Oh.

251
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,730
Oh, my bad.

252
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,310
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

253
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,130
Cancel, cancel, cancel.

254
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,310
Okay.

255
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

256
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

257
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,410
Trigger!

258
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:19,790
Spin!

259
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,930
Already, already.

260
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,190
Big money.

261
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,330
Big money.

262
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,810
Big money.

263
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,430
You know what?

264
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:49,570
I feel like this needs kind of like that rave music that uh is in buckshot roulette i feel like it needs that a little bit two rounds left thank you

265
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:17,770
maybe i'll think i'm gonna think on this one the nuclear button because if we do want big old bucks buckaroos if we want the green green the baby green green i love all sorts of I'm a green woman and I love the green baby.

266
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,510
Then maybe we go green.

267
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,710
Oh, well, thank you for the break.

268
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,670
I don't know that once you sit and start gambling, you don't even need to move unless you want to pee.

269
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,590
Anyway, let's download.

270
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,070
Let's download our winnings.

271
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,080
I love green.

272
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,120
I love green.

273
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,840
Green.

274
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,260
Green.

275
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,660
It's the green I see.

276
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,440
In my future, it's the green I get.

277
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,020
Maybe.

278
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,000
Green like this, Supa?

279
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,340
Uh, yeah!

280
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,140
Wait, am I gonna get...

281
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,600
Okay, there we go.

282
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,820
A little bit.

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Yahoo!

284
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,270
Okay.

285
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,130
We're starting off a little slow, but that's just how the game goes.

286
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,470
We're just at the very beginning, you know?

287
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,470
I have to be careful not to go over.

288
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,530
Okay.

289
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,410
Ah!

290
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,370
Ah!

291
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:23,530
More!

292
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,930
Doggy thanks for the gifted!

293
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,950
Now we gotta trust the process.

294
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,350
Come on, I'm getting so many clovers, but like not in a row.

295
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,070
Did I make any money?

296
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,990
Okay, I was gonna say...

297
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,790
I was about to say...

298
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,630
Can you imagine?

299
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,190
Huge!

300
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,970
Okay, there we go.

301
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,010
There we go.

302
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,190
Okay.

303
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,330
But, do I get this?

304
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,710
Do I get the nuclear?

305
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,270
You know what?

306
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm gonna try it.

307
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,650
I'm gonna try it.

308
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,470
Why not?

309
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,590
We'll get the button.

310
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,290
We'll get the button.

311
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,050
Yeah!

312
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,960
I forgot about the 666.

313
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,700
We'll be fine.

314
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,940
We're fine.

315
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,600
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

316
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,860
Double your coins.

317
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:37,820
Set your...

318
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,660
Oh, it's this one.

319
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,300
Actually, the first one might not be so bad.

320
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,180
The first one might not be so bad.

321
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,900
Make two random lucky charms store free.

322
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,780
Set your ticket.

323
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,480
Oh, wait.

324
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,800
Wait, let's see what we got first.

325
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,520
Let's see what we got first.

326
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
We might want to re-roll.

327
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,540
We got the electrician.

328
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,200
What's the battery modifier?

329
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,240
Wait, restoring a symbol with the modifier will restore one charge.

330
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
So a random charm triggered by the red button.

331
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,460
Yeah, three is good.

332
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:11,920
Wait!

333
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,520
Oh, it's a book of shadows.

334
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,200
I got the skull!

335
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,320
Do these do anything?

336
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,700
Do I...

337
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,840
If I create Exodia, does it do anything?

338
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,040
Pick number three.

339
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,940
Three, my lord.

340
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,540
It does?

341
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,720
It does.

342
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,040
If you have the corpse pieces.

343
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,620
Yeah.

344
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,060
I mean, I already got rid of my arm, though.

345
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,000
I feel like...

346
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,280
Oh, wait.

347
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,800
I can't even get the green pepper, though.

348
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,120
No!

349
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,400
No pepper for me.

350
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,000
No pepper, no pepper.

351
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:58,880
Nope.

352
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,000
You need to have all four drawers to assemble Zodia.

353
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,480
Yeah, I was gonna say Because they They don't go on my desk, right?

354
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,840
I don't display these.

355
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,560
Why don't I Just reach in there for some more parts?

356
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,400
Hmm I don't think I'm optimizing Very well.

357
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,520
Um Yeah, I'll re-roll Because what if I get like these two?

358
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,500
I'll be so sad.

359
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,220
Re-roll.

360
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,300
Diamonds Diamonds Seven.

361
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,300
Coin.

362
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,020
Charity.

363
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,580
I guess it could be worse.

364
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:51,980
Ugh.

365
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,260
Excuse me, hold on.

366
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,460
Get the coin.

367
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,960
Yeah, I don't think it's...

368
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,080
These are so not good for what I have going on, you know?

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,120
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

370
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,640
What's my debt?

371
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,760
Six, six, six.

372
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,840
Six, six, six.

373
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,380
What build are you going for?

374
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,380
Clover.

375
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,480
Right now.

376
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,660
I honestly don't know enough about the builds in this game, but we kind of got like a stonks clover thing going on.

377
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
I feel I feel stonks.

378
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,580
I feel interest is a very a good thing to invest in.

379
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,460
So...

380
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,040
No!

381
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,100
I think I'll...

382
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,040
Okay, what I think I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the coin.

383
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,760
And then I'm going to re-roll.

384
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,200
Why am I always getting the pool, man?

385
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,240
If only one pattern shows during a spin trip, transformed its symbols into the most valued symbol.

386
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,420
Wait!

387
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,480
That could be good.

388
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,360
Because if its value is either of these, that would be good.

389
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,040
Maybe...

390
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,600
Well, would it choose?

391
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,840
Who is good for Clover?

392
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,740
All patterns with non-yellow symbols will trigger an additional time.

393
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,180
Okay, I'm gonna...

394
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,160
Last three deadlines, then discard this charm.

395
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,380
At the end of each deadline, give as many tickets as the deadlines left of this charm.

396
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,500
Huh?

397
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,620
I don't get it.

398
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
What would Patrick Bateman do?

399
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:48,800
That?

400
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,380
Is that psycho?

401
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,320
Wait.

402
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,780
Is that the guy?

403
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,340
Wait.

404
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,900
Is that psycho?

405
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,220
Yeah?

406
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:00,660
Okay.

407
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,360
Wait, no.

408
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,360
American psycho.

409
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:05,720
Wait.

410
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,240
Is that the guy that kills the lady in the shower?

411
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,760
Vivi Kor, thank you for the five gifted!

412
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,200
Dresses up as his mom?

413
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,400
That's just psycho.

414
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,320
That's Norman.

415
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:24,980
Wait.

416
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
That's Norman Bates.

417
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,460
What?

418
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,200
Wait, then who's Patrick?

419
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,270
Who's Patrick Bates?

420
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,110
I'm thinking of Norman Bates.

421
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,910
American Psycho equals Christian Bale.

422
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,270
You guys said Patrick.

423
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,770
Patrick.

424
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:40,190
Baitman is Christian Bale American Psycho oh it's Baitman what do you think of Huey Lewis and the news what news is this the crusty crap no this is a Patrick Bates Norman Patrick middle name Norman Bates oh my goodness I Tony, thank you so much for the Tony gift and thank you!

425
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,180
What?

426
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,580
Okay, let's try for free and let's hope for the poo.

427
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,060
And maybe...

428
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,660
Maybe painkillers.

429
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,380
Let's hope for... Let's try it.

430
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,580
What do we have to lose?

431
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,880
I mean, I could double my coins, but I think we'll get good coins.

432
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,020
Patrick Starman.

433
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,660
Patrick Bateman played by Ryan Gosling.

434
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,440
Okay, you can't blame me, though, because they're both from a thing called Psycho.

435
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,080
And then, or at least Psycho in the name.

436
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,020
And then their last names are almost the same.

437
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,480
Are you sure?

438
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,880
I already made the decision.

439
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,820
Ah, dang, we didn't get our poo for free.

440
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,040
Dang, that's the one I needed the most.

441
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,040
Uh-oh, I only have one slot left.

442
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,480
Wait a second.

443
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,480
Oh, because this one takes away a slot.

444
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,760
Oh, well.

445
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,910
Why cherry and sell it?

446
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,950
Wait, can I do that?

447
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,010
I don't think I would get so much for it, though.

448
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,610
I don't think I would get three, Bach.

449
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:08,970
Oh, well, it's fine.

450
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,110
Let's see how this works with it.

451
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,730
If you use the drawer, put the button in the drawer.

452
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,250
How would I...

453
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,950
Oh, oh, put in drawer.

454
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:28,070
Oh, you guys are thinking with portals.

455
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,610
You guys are thinking with portals.

456
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,390
Oh my gosh!

457
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,050
I do get three.

458
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,550
That's the only thing that makes sense to get eaten, huh?

459
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,470
And then...

460
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:49,930
Equip.

461
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,010
Ha!

462
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,330
Ha!

463
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Ha!

464
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Ha!

465
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,420
Ha!

466
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Ha!

467
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Ha!

468
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,180
Ha!

469
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,180
Ha!

470
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Ha!

471
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,220
A one!

472
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,720
Wait, let me deposit my money.

473
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,260
Oh, please.

474
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,320
Whoa!

475
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,020
A one!

476
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,440
Two.

477
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,060
Three.

478
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,320
Why did it turn to sebit?

479
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,080
Oh, because that's the most...

480
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,560
Oh, yeah, I see, I see.

481
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,900
Kepia, welcome to Membo Ship.

482
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,740
Ah, good!

483
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,180
Lemon, lemon, lemon.

484
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,080
Um, am I gonna get...

485
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,160
Am I gonna get, um...

486
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,820
Oh, shucks.

487
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,780
Okay, thank you.

488
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,280
I've never done real Pachinko.

489
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:40,380
Only like a Pachinko that's free at like events you know I think okay what I'm gonna do is I'm not gonna press the button and I'm gonna let these charge together you know what I mean I'm scared of doing pachinko I'm gonna I'm scared

490
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,100
change the lemon

491
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,220
That would have been crazy.

492
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,620
Am I gonna make it?

493
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,460
Am I gonna die?

494
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,780
I'm not getting anything.

495
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,600
Honestly, this is kind of terrible.

496
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,480
Wait, the painkillers are terrible right now.

497
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,100
Well, not terrible, but...

498
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,620
You know what I mean.

499
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,120
Oh, shucks.

500
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,520
I think I might have to...

501
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,180
Uh...

502
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,260
I think I might have to...

503
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,220
Press the button.

504
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,500
Painkillers really, they're keeping you alive.

505
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,240
Yeah.

506
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,160
Like, they're good, but they're not what I want them to do because I need more...

507
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,580
I need more power on my Clover.

508
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,620
Ha!

509
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,760
We just need one good round.

510
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,880
One, but a good one.

511
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,920
This is pretty bad.

512
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,780
This is pretty bad.

513
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,920
I might be dead.

514
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,120
I might be done so right now.

515
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:10,290
If your knight is reliant on painkillers and poo, I promise it's not a good time.

516
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,400
Um...

517
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,720
Yeah, I think we're in desperate times.

518
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,760
I need to push the button.

519
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,760
It's desperate times!

520
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,340
It's double, too.

521
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,940
So this might actually be good.

522
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, come on.

523
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,300
Oh!

524
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
Okay!

525
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,580
This will...

526
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah!

527
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,120
Okay!

528
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,080
Woo!

529
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,360
This is...

530
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,240
This is...

531
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,720
This is the...

532
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,540
This is the gamble, baby.

533
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,340
This is the gamble, baby.

534
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,040
Oh, okay, nice.

535
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,480
One spin left.

536
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,200
That might have saved me.

537
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,520
That might have been what saved me!

538
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,240
Oh my god!

539
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,980
Yeah, I have enough!

540
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,740
We may or may not need the Takanashi Kiara build.

541
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,560
No, everybody can't do the same build all the time, you guys.

542
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,360
That's boring.

543
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,440
Boring, boring.

544
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,960
Wait, what was I doing?

545
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're good.

546
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:47,930
Barely.

547
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,970
Holy cow!

548
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,930
I'm putting it all on green.

549
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,810
Oh, we're so screwed.

550
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,210
Oh, I could double the value of clovers and bells.

551
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,490
What's the...

552
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,490
Oh, every last pattern triggers one more time.

553
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,970
I think we're feeling lucky.

554
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,310
What do we got here going on?

555
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,230
We got some red peppers.

556
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,450
We got some clickers.

557
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,830
We got some irons.

558
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,910
We got some horseshoe.

559
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,650
Choose Charms with trigger randomly activate double more.

560
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,900
I think we just got it.

561
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,560
I can't.

562
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,900
Neither of them are charged.

563
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,800
This is so bad.

564
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,240
But look at that now.

565
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,720
Maybe it's okay.

566
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,500
Yeah.

567
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,740
Do we need the poop jar?

568
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,300
Oh!

569
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:15,690
Three.

570
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,010
It didn't even come up!

571
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,490
The pills will work now.

572
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,310
Yeah, exactly.

573
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,410
Let's go gambling.

574
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,170
Oh, geez.

575
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,570
This is so bad.

576
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,830
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it.

577
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,870
Guys.

578
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,050
This might be a bust.

579
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,560
All we need is one.

580
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,860
One but a good one.

581
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,220
One but a good one.

582
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,730
I think I'll be able to do the poop on the last spin.

583
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,410
Let's go, carefully.

584
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:23,770
Hi!

585
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,400
Terry!

586
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,480
Terry, Terry boy!

587
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,280
Terry, Terry girl!

588
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,400
This is quite bleak.

589
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,720
Guys, this is pretty bleak.

590
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,800
I think we're cooked.

591
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,180
I think we're cooked.

592
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,640
Guys!

593
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,000
Hey!

594
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,120
My things are not aligning at all, which is what's really bad.

595
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,120
It's my fault, I guess, but...

596
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,700
Next spin is a... 10,000?

597
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,710
Oh!

598
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,910
See, that would have been really great if it was a lot more close.

599
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,550
Oh, please!

600
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:53,990
Oh,

601
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,970
I got an extra spin!

602
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,350
Uh-oh.

603
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,030
Are you bad at me?

604
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:14,670
Ah!

605
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,570
Let me have the buddy at least!

606
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,390
I'll die with it!

607
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,100
Sad.

608
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,440
How did I get so lucky the first time, huh, I wonder?

609
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,260
I had such a good first run.

610
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,500
This next one is hot dog, I swear.

611
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,900
Again, again, again!

612
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,940
Oh, we got something new.

613
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,840
What's that, though?

614
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,100
When you are about to die, you get two extra rounds.

615
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Then discard this charm.

616
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,820
I see, I could have used that.

617
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,100
I could have used that.

618
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
I could've...

619
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:08,880
I could've.

620
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,300
I could...

621
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,860
Yeah!

622
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,280
Yeah!

623
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,520
I think maybe.

624
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,120
We'll just grab the coin for now.

625
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,940
But is this one of lucky time triggers during a spin?

626
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,760
Or is this bonus by one?

627
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,720
Oh yeah, that's right.

628
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,160
Thank you, thank you!

629
00:38:34,120 --> 00:39:18,660
Rip me into wait You can still say that I you can still wish for me to rest in peace I mean I'm not Because I'm here I'm not Because I'm dead but It's still nice to you know Wish for that and for ghosts I'm a restless spirit But you know I need more luck I need more luck Maybe we will get the hamster Maybe we will get it Let's go gambling Let's go gambling

630
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:33,290
Maybe I will go with lemon Lemon is kind of like I like to collect things I have lemons on them you know What's the salt for?

631
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:33,910
Huh?

632
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,480
Oh Lemon, lemon, lemon.

633
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,960
I think I made $1.

634
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,720
I think I made, like, no money.

635
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,080
So sad.

636
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,440
Can I even, actually, can I even get this?

637
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,900
Will I be able to get three?

638
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,500
I guess.

639
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,640
Maybe not.

640
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,080
I think this is the sign.

641
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,060
This is the sign that I need to go.

642
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,980
I'm so full lemon!

643
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,500
Maybe you guys were right.

644
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,120
Maybe I should have... Maybe I wasn't getting one guide.

645
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:23,900
Maybe.

646
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,720
Oh, more lemons!

647
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,660
More lemons!

648
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,280
Lemon maxing?

649
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,760
Oh,

650
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,620
I can get this.

651
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
I'm gonna try it.

652
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,860
I want to be lucky.

653
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,200
I want to be lucky!

654
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,440
Please!

655
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,520
Hey!

656
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,160
I got lemons again!

657
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,740
And more lemons!

658
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Why?

659
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,060
Why?

660
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:20,840
Why?

661
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,180
Why?

662
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,920
Thanks for the lemon, Murphy.

663
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,460
Boop, boop!

664
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,190
Oh, nice.

665
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,930
Lemons are only worth two, but I guess because there's so many, huh?

666
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,050
Lemon!

667
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,410
Lemon!

668
00:41:59,170 --> 00:41:59,510
Lemon!

669
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:00,350
Lemon!

670
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,370
Lemon!

671
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,150
Sorry for Club Iron Mouse?

672
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,550
I'm excited!

673
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,490
I am!

674
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,850
I'm so excited!

675
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,410
I'm so excited!

676
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,530
Thank you, thank you!

677
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,790
Cha-ching!

678
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,550
So I go, thank you so much for the fun!

679
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,870
Thank you!

680
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,590
Lemons?

681
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,790
Gold and diamonds are a good investment.

682
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,610
Double the value of diamonds and treasures.

683
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:33,590
At the ambitious trait, patterns multiplier plus one to a random lucky charm you have equipped.

684
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,930
And the ore I could get 5...

685
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,200
5.

686
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,480
When life gives you lemons, you re-spin.

687
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,300
Let's see, hold on real quick, what we have here as well.

688
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,880
D4 re-rolls all symbols that are not inside a pattern during the current spin.

689
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,540
Ah, I see I see.

690
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,820
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, go, go, go, go, go, go!

691
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,740
Thank you!

692
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,480
Thank you!

693
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,440
I don't want to...

694
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,960
I don't think I need to really spend here, so maybe I re-roll.

695
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,720
D4 is good.

696
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,260
I guess it always helps guarantee that you...

697
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,340
Or not, it's not always, but it guarantees that you will then get money.

698
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,580
But I would have to not re-roll, I would have to get the green, the green...

699
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,140
How much is it?

700
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,440
Three?

701
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,660
I'll be able to get it at the end, no?

702
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,660
Yeah, let's re-roll this.

703
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,100
And then...

704
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,800
And then...

705
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,680
I'll just play.

706
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:58,960
Oh.

707
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:06,900
Oh.

708
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,680
Oh.

709
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,940
Do we become a cherry boy instead?

710
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,180
But lemons, it was like prophesied to me, I feel.

711
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,360
I've been getting so many lemons.

712
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,620
Increase the value of patterns with three or less symbols by their base value.

713
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,560
Fruit run?

714
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,300
Wait, but then I should have gotten the cherry earlier.

715
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,480
I do like cherries.

716
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,420
Do you?

717
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:49,660
Oh, wait!

718
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,200
I do have cherries.

719
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,740
Oh, I do say...

720
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,480
I do have cherries.

721
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,960
Oh, but I can only get one or the other.

722
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,440
Let's go for now.

723
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,260
Let's go for now.

724
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,700
Look at this!

725
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,140
This just feels like it's meant for me.

726
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,980
Lemons.

727
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,300
Oh, thank God.

728
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:18,740
Something.

729
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,180
Guys, this is not...

730
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,960
Oh, just a little.

731
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,240
Oh, one more!

732
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,760
Thank you!

733
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,520
So kind!

734
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,750
What is this lock?

735
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,950
Oh, you must be new here.

736
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:50,850
Welcome to Mint Phantom Channel, where I love gambling, and I also am an extremely unlucky ghost.

737
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,870
Thank you!

738
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,510
That's the part of the thrill!

739
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,890
Is when I hit them highs!

740
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,090
Which I don't do often.

741
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,510
I sure hit them.

742
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:06,610
Sometimes.

743
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,150
Sometimes.

744
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:16,010
I've become a wist just before your 3D debut.

745
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:17,710
Thank you!

746
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,090
Thank you so much!

747
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,250
So, welcome!

748
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,850
How can this cute and small body create such a powerful, wonderful voice?

749
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,540
I love your clear laugh as well.

750
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,570
Thanks.

751
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:30,770
Thank you.

752
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,350
Thank you.

753
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,150
Who's kissing the cherry poll?

754
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,130
Polaroid!

755
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,290
Gambling loves you too.

756
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,630
It's me, I'm kissing it.

757
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,380
Hi, these cherries are They're betraying me!

758
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,420
I wish the coin would trigger on the final spin.

759
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:08,820
Oh!

760
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,520
Like that!

761
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,140
Like that!

762
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,580
And then I do...

763
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,570
With no... With no multipliers!

764
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,290
I got my first jackpot!

765
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,180
You, you, you!

766
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,180
Well, I guess that is a multiplier, huh?

767
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,400
But you know what I mean!

768
00:47:50,540 --> 00:48:07,580
I told you The lows are low, but the highs are highs, baby Wait Is this my last turn or Can I Oh yes, I can spin again Right?

769
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,170
One more round Okay, okay

770
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,860
I'm still deciding Oh, I singly trace, thank you Let's go!

771
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,820
For anyone playing at home, let's finish your drink.

772
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,460
What are you, what are you playing?

773
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,580
Well, this one has a higher rarity, so maybe I get the D4, huh?

774
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,380
Maybe I get the D4.

775
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,500
Let's go get it.

776
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,900
It's so beautiful!

777
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,040
Yeah!

778
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:59,220
I think they'll get the D4.

779
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,120
I think so.

780
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,060
Yeah, 30% isn't bad.

781
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,240
You're right, you're right, you're right.

782
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,480
Free spin!

783
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,840
What are my cherries looking at?

784
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,840
Oh, actually, that's okay, you know.

785
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,900
Oh, that scared me.

786
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,620
I didn't realize.

787
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,440
Oh!

788
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,100
Oh!

789
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,020
Lucky hand, lucky hand!

790
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,500
Wait, this is kind of awesome.

791
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,920
Wait, this combo is kind of crazy.

792
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:30,900
Wait.

793
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,540
Wait.

794
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:34,620
Wait.

795
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,000
It's kind of great.

796
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,080
Peep.

797
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,240
I'll be back for you, little cherry.

798
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,000
I'll be back for you, my sweet.

799
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,860
Yes.

800
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,580
Yes.

801
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:05,740
Yes.

802
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,380
Have some peace.

803
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,980
It doubles your clover tickets, it sets your coins to zero.

804
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,880
Make random lucky charms in the store free.

805
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,580
Well, what we have?

806
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,480
What we got?

807
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:21,960
Doesn't take space.

808
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,800
Immediately earn 30% of the debt amount.

809
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,820
Oh, wait.

810
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,680
Oh, but I can't buy.

811
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,240
I have nothing.

812
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,140
Wait, one is good.

813
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh, because we're trying to get more cherries, right?

814
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:38,880
Oh.

815
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,040
And or lemons.

816
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,040
Yeah, less of those means more cherries, exactly.

817
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,600
We'll go with it.

818
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,460
Thank you guys for helping me out.

819
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,640
Thank you.

820
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,080
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

821
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:00,350
All right.

822
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,620
I only have a couple things.

823
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,660
We'll see how the...

824
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,340
What does this do again?

825
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,480
Oh, yes, yes.

826
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,120
We'll see how our D24...

827
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,380
Whoa, that like crazy took them out.

828
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,120
Wow.

829
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,280
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

830
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,780
I need to raise my cherry amount though.

831
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,580
We need to get more.

832
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,220
I can't afford anything though.

833
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,320
Let's go carefully.

834
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:33,660
Wait!

835
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:36,800
Whoa.

836
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,320
Whoa!

837
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,140
Whoa, it's triggered immediately.

838
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,880
Big cherry!

839
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,250
Like, right now, I'm getting stuff ish, but like the amount is so low, it's like, you know?

840
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,940
Lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon!

841
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:22,770
Yeah, the value is low, but that's why you like kind of, they show up more though, you know?

842
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,970
Lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon.

843
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:37,230
That's crazy because lemons show up so much, but I have the higher multiplier or higher percentage on cherries.

844
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,650
It's so strange.

845
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:41,110
Okay.

846
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,300
See, look at this!

847
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,140
How?

848
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,000
No, I think it's... I think lemons is cheating!

849
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,240
Oh, that was scary.

850
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
I think it's...

851
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,460
Whoa!

852
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,160
Sorry.

853
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,220
Oh my gosh, so close.

854
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,050
I need to take a sip before that.

855
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,810
Come on, baby!

856
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:34,370
And...

857
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:35,550
Lucky spin?

858
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,750
Mkai.

859
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:42,890
Mkai.

860
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,430
Thanks for the drinks, you guys.

861
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,090
Thank you.

862
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:49,650
Alright.

863
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:50,930
Alright.

864
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:52,710
Wait.

865
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,750
I'm not quite there yet.

866
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:59,670
Not quite there yet.

867
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:02,310
Yeah.

868
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,570
Let's just keep going.

869
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,570
I know the payouts are so small.

870
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:08,110
It's kind of...

871
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,790
painful right now.

872
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:13,070
I think next round it's really gonna hurt us.

873
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,510
Unless we can do some.

874
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,270
Unless we give something.

875
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,020
Briefcase doesn't mean you're safe.

876
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,460
Oh, true.

877
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,560
True, true, true, true.

878
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,280
But...

879
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,190
We'll see.

880
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,310
Because...

881
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:42,230
Yeah.

882
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,610
Oh, we need scaling.

883
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,890
Oh, we're getting more spins though, this is kind of awesome.

884
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,680
Everything's just so small, everything, look, we're six, that's nothing.

885
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,880
Need that golden cherry.

886
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,080
All right, lucky spin!

887
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,900
Ah, so close!

888
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,400
Dusty dog, thank you so much for the time!

889
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,220
Thank you!

890
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:11,660
Okay.

891
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,280
So stinking close.

892
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,400
Because immediately earned 30% of the debt amount.

893
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,880
I don't think it's worth spending the two tickets on it, you know?

894
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,790
Oh, we're so screwed.

895
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,510
Charm space by one permanently.

896
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,910
Add the ambitious trait.

897
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,550
Patterns multiplier plus one to random lucky charm.

898
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:58,950
Okay, let's see what we got.

899
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,030
Plus one option is at the telephone.

900
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:11,650
Wait, during every spin, increase all symbols by their base value for every pattern triggered after the second one.

901
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,540
That'll...

902
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,540
Mushroom is good?

903
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,480
I don't really understand it though.

904
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,380
Explain it to me like I'm a baby.

905
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,340
Explain it to me like I'm a baby.

906
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:48,080
What I could do It keeps adding points per roll scored Oh

907
00:56:52,610 --> 00:57:11,140
Big numbers I like big numbers What I'm thinking though Okay hold on If I do the diary And then I go back to the phone I could get an extra option And then after the next round I could get the mushrooms Okay

908
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,850
Oh wait, but this stays over here, doesn't it?

909
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:26,820
Treasures.

910
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:39,740
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this.

911
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,290
Plus one charm slot is really good.

912
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:53,230
I need to start multiplying my...

913
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,330
That's why I want to...

914
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:00,770
I can get it next round.

915
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,150
I can get it next round.

916
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,330
Will I have enough money?

917
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,070
You know?

918
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,270
I'm going to get the mushroom.

919
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,450
We can maybe get this again someday.

920
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:18,530
I'm going to get the mushroom.

921
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:19,910
I'm going to get the mushroom.

922
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:22,070
Okay.

923
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:27,270
Oh, wait.

924
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,290
Okay, shoo!

925
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,110
Let's go gambling!

926
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,310
Yeah, we need to not die!

927
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,470
Okay.

928
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,450
How do I know what the mushroom is doing?

929
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,990
Alright, mushroom!

930
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,830
For charms!

931
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,480
What did it do?

932
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,820
Check cherry.

933
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:06,860
Oh!

934
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,980
So many clover.

935
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,560
It's not bad though.

936
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,920
It's worth a good amount.

937
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,080
It resets every round.

938
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,140
Okay, okay, okay.

939
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,160
Another hodou?

940
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,660
I see, I see.

941
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,800
I don't know though, guys.

942
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,740
It's still not a lot.

943
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,700
It's still not a lot that we're reaping in, you know?

944
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,980
I don't think we're gonna make it.

945
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,260
I don't think we're gonna make it.

946
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,900
Let's go get ready.

947
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,880
I don't think we're gonna make it.

948
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,740
Oh, we're not gonna.

949
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,540
gonna make it.

950
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,120
We're not gonna make it!

951
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,480
We're not gonna make it!

952
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,680
This is so bad.

953
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,440
We're not gonna make it.

954
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:37,160
I think

955
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:58,220
since I'm not gonna make it we just re-roll and see what we get maybe

956
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,540
the pepper pepper might work yeah

957
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:50,110
where do you see what my luck is or is this the no this is the money wait where do you see what the luck is because I see sometimes you guys are like oh if you have 15 luck you guarantee It's jackpot.

958
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,130
Oh, it's hidden.

959
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:56,370
Oh, okay, okay.

960
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,010
I was gonna say.

961
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,210
How do you guys know then?

962
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,610
Should I reroll again?

963
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,410
I really, I'm like...

964
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:09,410
It will, like, basically half my amount over, but...

965
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:12,610
Uh...

966
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,410
More clovers?

967
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:21,510
We get free money?

968
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,790
All abilities that you pick on the telephone trigger one more time.

969
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:26,990
Uh...

970
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:27,690
Labid!

971
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,470
Wait!

972
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:35,330
I could get the briefcase.

973
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,990
Let's do a free money.

974
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:44,790
And...

975
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,210
Immediately earn 30% of the dead amount.

976
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:48,850
I guess...

977
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:49,870
Yeah.

978
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:51,470
I could use that.

979
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:56,790
I could definitely use that.

980
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:24,650
get the lemon but like lemon I don't know

981
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:33,860
I don't think so I don't know I don't know

982
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:47,250
I'm gonna die if I die I die I guess you know whatever let's go gambling

983
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:58,250
all of that all of that for what

984
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:14,050
okay more lemons please trying to look over okay see there I just want to see them out

985
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:22,250
okay as long as we keep getting spins from the coin it's not so bad I suppose.

986
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,410
Okay.

987
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,950
What are you doing anyway, huh?

988
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,570
Are you even helping?

989
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,230
Are you even helping right now?

990
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,930
Cherries are like...

991
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,330
Ah, it's all us, baby.

992
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:49,430
Ah!

993
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,540
That was insane!

994
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,030
Never back down, never won!

995
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,690
Oh my god!

996
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,510
Oh my god!

997
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,610
Oh, we're...

998
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,650
I don't know about this one, guys.

999
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:56,810
Wait, what?

1000
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,550
All of these are...

1001
01:05:58,550 --> 01:05:59,890
None of these are...

1002
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:02,510
Okay, but she's hooked.

1003
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,880
When life gives you lemons, make money.

1004
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,040
Four is good, this one.

1005
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,600
Here's the value of patterns with four plus symbols by their base value.

1006
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:22,600
Okay.

1007
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,100
Pattern one.

1008
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,320
There's the other pattern.

1009
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,100
I don't know.

1010
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,180
I found a winning strategy!

1011
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:29,980
Oh my gosh, wait!

1012
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,500
How do they have that emoji?

1013
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:33,640
Wait!

1014
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,340
When you're about to die, you get the two extra rounds!

1015
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:37,240
Wait!

1016
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,740
Lucky cat!

1017
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,520
And we could get the 30%!

1018
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:43,260
Wait.

1019
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:45,920
What is it?

1020
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,580
What am I at?

1021
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,740
Well, I'm at 7 out of 7, you lies.

1022
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,900
I think I'll sell the book.

1023
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:59,660
I think I'll sell the book...

1024
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,780
And then we can get the briefcase and the cat.

1025
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,680
Store it?

1026
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,620
I guess that's... Well, oh, I only get one back for it.

1027
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,480
Wait, how much was it?

1028
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:16,680
Three.

1029
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,820
Oh, I can.

1030
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,920
I don't have to sell it at all.

1031
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:19,380
Just kidding.

1032
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,220
She's not gonna make it!

1033
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,380
She's not gonna make it!

1034
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,120
She bought it!

1035
01:07:29,320 --> 01:08:59,600
that references my all-time it's not even my favorite ride okay there's this okay you guys i think i've talked about this on i'm almost positive i talked about this on stream before the the dinosaur ride uh animal kingdom and oh i have okay we'll watch it later i'll show you guys i'll show you guys like a little i watch this like uh pov of riding the ride every like every now and then but at the end of the ride it's so funny because like okay so the ride is you are going back in time to um to dinosaur era to get an iguanodon i don't know reason they teleport you back in time to like to like two minutes before the meteor hits because you know whatever the the thrill of it all i suppose and so um and so uh uh you are riding through and you're you're looking at the dinosaur and you're just like no not that dino that not that dino and then and then the meteor starts coming in they're just like oh gosh oh don't worry about it these are just tiny meteors you'll be fine just dodge them okay

1036
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:13,500
and then you finally find the iguanodon and he's like no just leave it you're we gotta get you back and then at the very end of the ride he goes they're not gonna make it they're not gonna make it

1037
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:55,200
it's so funny down the ride for Indiana Jones and I'm so sad I'm gonna try and make time to go on it one last time I've only been on it like once but I remember it so vividly even before even before like watching the POV of it I remember it so vividly anyway what was I doing oh I was putting you in the drawer and then we're gonna buy you and buy you money money money

1038
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:03,120
Okay, now we have a decent interest.

1039
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,980
500, not bad.

1040
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:05,920
Thank you, Cat.

1041
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:06,480
Thank you.

1042
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,320
And I think we can start.

1043
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,380
Great save on the ride.

1044
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,100
I, oh my gosh, I can't believe we actually lived.

1045
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,220
I can't believe it.

1046
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,210
This could be better.

1047
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:24,870
Oh, thank you.

1048
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:29,270
Lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon.

1049
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:30,450
The U.S.

1050
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:31,850
Mint got nothing on...

1051
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:32,670
Made men.

1052
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,250
What's the U.S.

1053
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:34,550
men?

1054
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:36,890
Wham!

1055
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,770
I like the sound the 666 makes.

1056
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:41,470
Okay, this is not good.

1057
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,070
I could be really lucky right now!

1058
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:47,270
Uh...

1059
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:48,790
Oh!

1060
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,470
That wasn't so bad at the end.

1061
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,330
I suppose?

1062
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:55,230
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1063
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,050
Cat carry.

1064
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,970
Honestly, cat is so good.

1065
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,290
I feel like he is for every run.

1066
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,090
I wish my lemon would recharge, though.

1067
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,450
Almost!

1068
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:28,430
Oh my gosh.

1069
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:34,270
Let's go.

1070
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:36,450
Cherry, cherry, cherry.

1071
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:40,830
Yeah!

1072
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,340
Cherry.

1073
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,620
I can't...

1074
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,440
Oh, thank goodness.

1075
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,460
We got another spin.

1076
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,460
Please, please!

1077
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,300
Please, please!

1078
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,160
Oh!

1079
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,320
Cat is OP.

1080
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:07,760
Yeah, for real.

1081
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,380
I don't know, though.

1082
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:16,840
Maybe.

1083
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,720
If we...

1084
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,700
Maybe.

1085
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,820
I keep thinking the dark mass to the left of the machine is a person.

1086
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:28,900
This?

1087
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,260
Oh, I see it.

1088
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,980
I see, like, the head and the shoulders here.

1089
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,840
Oh, freaky!

1090
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:35,560
Creepy!

1091
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,580
I don't have room for the yonk.

1092
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,060
I don't have room for it.

1093
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,540
My D... whatever.

1094
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,960
D4 has not gone off in a bit.

1095
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:55,720
Oh wait, yes it has.

1096
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,260
I'm sorry.

1097
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,260
I forgot what it did.

1098
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,300
Sell lemon?

1099
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,600
I guess we could.

1100
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,180
Just in case, have this.

1101
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,040
Just in case.

1102
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:14,920
Hmm.

1103
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,400
Check the pepper.

1104
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:19,530
What about it?

1105
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:24,670
4 activate.

1106
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:28,010
Oh, I forgot that we have to get rid of it after a certain amount of time.

1107
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,070
No, no, no!

1108
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:32,790
No!

1109
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,120
I think I'll get the Ankh just in.

1110
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:45,900
Okay.

1111
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,220
Oh yeah, it would work well with this too, huh?

1112
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,720
Because we get the extra rounds.

1113
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:06,420
Juicy.

1114
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,580
Whoa, it's glowing.

1115
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,130
Let's go gambling.

1116
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,430
Let's go gambling.

1117
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:17,770
Hoi!

1118
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,150
Oh, come on.

1119
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:30,070
Seriously?

1120
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,430
Okay, it's a good thing we bought it.

1121
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,530
It's a good thing we bought it!

1122
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:50,830
Oh my gosh It's a good thing we bought it It's a really good thing we bought it Oh it's a good thing we bought it Oh my gosh it's a good thing we bought it

1123
01:14:53,990 --> 01:15:01,430
What no I have more Wait no no way to have it Use use use use Wait how do I use it

1124
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:11,640
Oh okay I uses it Well well well Looks like I'm obliged to give you those extra rounds.

1125
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,420
Mere death experience survive.

1126
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,740
Oh, nice.

1127
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,420
Oh my gosh.

1128
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,460
Look, we were so close even, too.

1129
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,560
That's kind of messed up.

1130
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,380
Okay.

1131
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,040
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take...

1132
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,920
It doesn't really do anything, but I'm going to equip it so that we can at least get the...

1133
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:40,820
extra things.

1134
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,600
Holy cow!

1135
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:46,660
Cherry,

1136
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,780
cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, oh!

1137
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,200
We made it!

1138
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,780
Where were you?

1139
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,340
Where was this luck before, huh?

1140
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,280
But it's fine because we get the two extra rounds, so we'll get some extra money.

1141
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,440
Okay.

1142
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:28,540
Yeah, a little bit of a head start, exactly, exactly.

1143
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,040
Oh, nice!

1144
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,250
My pepper.

1145
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:55,490
That was a good amount.

1146
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:59,290
That was a good amount, everybody.

1147
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:10,650
Oh, I want to deposit it for the extra interest, but I will refrain since we paid for this extra round.

1148
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:11,770
So I will...

1149
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:12,090
Yeah.

1150
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,190
We paid for it.

1151
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:18,370
Let's go gambling.

1152
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:19,950
Let's go gambling.

1153
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:27,390
Yeah, we'll also get two extra tickets.

1154
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:32,190
Whoa, whoa.

1155
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:35,830
Where are the cherries?

1156
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,490
Where are the cherries?

1157
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,590
Nice, nice, and nice.

1158
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,290
Look at them.

1159
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:44,530
One of these numbers is not blind.

1160
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:47,450
Yeah!

1161
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:51,510
Cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry!

1162
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,980
Look how much we're getting!

1163
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,600
Cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry!

1164
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,540
Yippee!

1165
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,360
Deposit your coins!

1166
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:22,740
Okay!

1167
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,400
We have many more.

1168
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,380
We have a good head start now!

1169
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:30,360
Oh!

1170
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,460
Okay, cool.

1171
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:36,950
One checky!

1172
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,610
Uh, I'm gonna hold on to this.

1173
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:43,350
Wait, let's see.

1174
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:45,710
Cherry!

1175
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:47,410
What?

1176
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:48,150
Uh-oh.

1177
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:49,810
Well, we have to make the decision.

1178
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,950
Cherries versus lemons.

1179
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:54,150
Wait!

1180
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,170
Cherries versus Leavitts!

1181
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,430
Wait, what do we have here?

1182
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,970
Because I think the only way that...

1183
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,690
What is this?

1184
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,630
Okay.

1185
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:07,330
The only way...

1186
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:12,510
The only way we can...

1187
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:15,610
I've kept the extra money, so just in case I wanted to restock.

1188
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:21,390
The only way we could survive, though, is making the cherries more expensive, you guys!

1189
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:31,710
more it's the only way it's the only way i do have oh i only have one slot left oh it's oh because of the

1190
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:51,400
patterns multiplier plus one that could be good oh i wait i can't afford it i could i could give it i could put the book away again okay what i'm gonna do is go for the cherry

1191
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,020
Next round, I guess that's true.

1192
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,980
Play one round, yeah.

1193
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,400
We'll play one round.

1194
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,100
And then I could re-roll after if I wanted to.

1195
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,680
Sapphire Eagle!

1196
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,460
I got my main gear flash on Tuesday and some of the B-Day merch.

1197
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,620
Thank you!

1198
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,000
Sadly, I haven't been able to stop by recently, but I've been busy finishing college!

1199
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,460
You got this!

1200
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,860
I might graduate real soon.

1201
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,820
Hope your luck is good today.

1202
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:43,700
Thank you!

1203
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,020
Learn lots.

1204
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,260
Learn lots.

1205
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:48,500
Okay.

1206
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:49,580
Alright.

1207
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:51,420
Alright.

1208
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,760
I mean, we're not doing so poorly right now.

1209
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,400
So, we'll do the one round.

1210
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,100
And then we will...

1211
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,020
Grab the stonks.

1212
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,260
So much!

1213
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:13,600
Oh!

1214
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:13,900
Oh!

1215
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,920
So much!

1216
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:19,640
Oh.

1217
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,720
I thought I had a pattern there, no.

1218
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:31,320
It's always the same amount, though.

1219
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,360
Nice!

1220
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,720
Wait, this is so awesome.

1221
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,600
It's not going to be super sustainable forever, but it's pretty great right now.

1222
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,720
Oh, so many Terry!

1223
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:02,620
Yawa!

1224
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,120
Nice!

1225
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,040
Oh, it's the cat adding the entrance.

1226
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:11,700
Okay, okay.

1227
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,440
So now I can buy...

1228
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,140
Ew.

1229
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,040
And we have a...

1230
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,780
Yeah, we have two.

1231
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:20,080
Okay.

1232
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:26,700
Wait.

1233
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,480
It will tell me, right?

1234
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,580
I don't remember when it stops.

1235
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,900
Oh, it stops telling me after...

1236
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:32,740
I get this, right?

1237
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,280
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1238
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:36,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1239
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,720
Okay, and this also...

1240
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,880
It had, like, a special thing.

1241
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,600
Patterns, multiplier, plus one.

1242
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,120
So, that's exciting.

1243
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:49,020
Maybe...

1244
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,340
Eight ticket bonus.

1245
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,160
What if we...

1246
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,140
No, it's okay, I think.

1247
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,880
Big fat cat!

1248
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:09,800
Wait, what was

1249
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:19,980
the...

1250
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,340
Oh, wow!

1251
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,640
Wow, the money is going kind of insane now.

1252
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,340
Okay.

1253
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:42,250
I forgot I've been meaning to ask Can I like leave Even if I'm mid like round

1254
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:54,120
Many lemons Oh yeah Oh you can't Okay that's what I thought

1255
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:04,170
Yubi Holy...

1256
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:04,470
Money!

1257
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:06,970
Money!

1258
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,100
Chonky cat.

1259
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,800
Look at that fat cat.

1260
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:24,440
Whenever seven plus patterns trigger during a spin you earn money equal to double your current interest!

1261
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,400
Let's hope we get this guy.

1262
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:38,220
Should I...

1263
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,320
I want to almost...

1264
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,500
I almost want to like restock, but we only have one round.

1265
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,140
How much?

1266
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,700
I get four tickets if I sell early.

1267
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,080
Hmm.

1268
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,340
What do you guys think?

1269
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,880
You can get it if you restock, but it's not guaranteed.

1270
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,400
I do need tickets.

1271
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:08,200
Well, yes.

1272
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,080
But also, what I have right now is not so bad.

1273
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:16,590
Okay.

1274
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:17,770
I'm gonna

1275
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,740
restock.

1276
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,460
I restock if I'm about to deposit?

1277
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:52,490
I've never tried to leave before.

1278
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:55,590
But then at the same time,

1279
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:03,290
I've never tried to leave before.

1280
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:04,950
Look at the golden lemon!

1281
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,960
What does it... If I click on this, you could spoil.

1282
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:20,180
If I click on this, don't spoil what happens, but if I click on this, will it make it so that i can't open a drawer

1283
01:26:25,100 --> 01:27:16,160

1284
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,060
add the gambler trait gain one free restock every deadline to a random Lucky charm.

1285
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,440
I think I'm still going to go with the cherries.

1286
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,920
I think I'll still go with the cherries, though.

1287
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:41,860
You do you.

1288
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:46,900
Cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry.

1289
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,940
Do I get the extra spins?

1290
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,500
Cherry, cherry, boy, cherry, cherry, girl.

1291
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,740
That is a song from aka 48 if you were wondering what i was singing

1292
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,430
look to the left of the shop

1293
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:31,740
what this i've already looked at this and the toilet i've already done the toilet is there anything else i can do maybe i should do the cat food

1294
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:41,980
spins pair well with the mushroom true oh my gosh wait you're so right i was thinking of the hand but the mushroom is That's huge!

1295
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,640
Okay, I think we're good to go.

1296
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,320
Let's go gambling.

1297
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,020
What's, what?

1298
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,780
You really don't know when to stop!

1299
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:52,840
I know.

1300
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,460
More cherries!

1301
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,880
More cherries!

1302
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,080
Cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry!

1303
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:15,800
Cherry!

1304
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:20,840
Yay!

1305
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,540
Oh, so close.

1306
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,260
Yay!

1307
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:36,220
I really need to get the cherry, the golden cherry, though, I think.

1308
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,920
I think I need...

1309
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,700
The final speed.

1310
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:02,400
I think we'll be okay.

1311
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:03,660
It's just the first round.

1312
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:07,660
Okay.

1313
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:10,920
That was so sad!

1314
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,300
That was so sad!

1315
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,560
Ah,

1316
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,400
so close.

1317
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,800
Yeah, it's the catfoods farm!

1318
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,040
Look, we almost made it back.

1319
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,700
It's the catfoods farm!

1320
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,710
We're all shot, but I have no...

1321
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:56,270
Well, I guess I could try for the golden cherry.

1322
01:30:56,370 --> 01:30:57,410
I need the golden cherry.

1323
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:59,710
I need the cherries to be, like, way more...

1324
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:03,660
Hmm.

1325
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,840
I could!

1326
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,540
Yeah, we have two more turns.

1327
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:14,020
We're okay.

1328
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:14,840
We're okay for sure.

1329
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,680
I could get eight tickets.

1330
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,600
That'd be crazy.

1331
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,160
They're only worth two.

1332
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:21,680
I know!

1333
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,980
We need to increase their value somehow.

1334
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,600
Well, well, it's only manifest, though.

1335
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,020
Clover voucher.

1336
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,420
Free money?

1337
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,780
The cherry, or the mushroom increases it, the more you get...

1338
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:52,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1339
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:04,850
I don't know what I would get.

1340
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:08,790
Probably the D4, maybe, to get rid of...

1341
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:33,530
that let me store it let me store that and then we can get that d4 is good yeah but what else do i get rid of maybe the cat food i'm not gonna sell the d4 the chamsa no no this thing this thing has saved my booty

1342
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:44,560
stonks can go in the drawer now i know you're trolling

1343
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,340
It's sell the interest, you guys are crazy.

1344
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,740
I'm gonna put this in the...

1345
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:06,760
I'm gonna put the food in my drawer.

1346
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:12,080
And then we'll buy this and see how we go.

1347
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,180
See how we go, see how we go.

1348
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:18,200
We're fine anyway, so...

1349
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:25,710
Okay.

1350
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:27,810
Looking real nice.

1351
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,760
So close.

1352
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:54,830
Yeah, baby!

1353
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:13,060
Evil!

1354
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,620
That's so evil!

1355
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:20,460
That's so evil!

1356
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:27,390
Wow!

1357
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,170
Ah!

1358
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:37,560
I almost want to just...

1359
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,600
Can't decide.

1360
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:39,640
I'm being indecisive.

1361
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,880
I'm being indecisive.

1362
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,000
Um...

1363
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,040
Do I want the four tickets?

1364
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,510
I already re-rolled.

1365
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:56,730
What do you mean, re-roll once?

1366
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,610
I re-rolled before.

1367
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:05,390
Tickets to fix our build.

1368
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:06,570
What's wrong with our build?

1369
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:07,790
What are you talking about?

1370
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:09,230
Fix the build.

1371
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:11,350
What are you talking about?

1372
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,660
I got a golden cherry.

1373
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,440
I got a golden cherry.

1374
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,520
Da da da da da da da da da da da da.

1375
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,040
And Chris.

1376
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:50,590
Interest?

1377
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:51,010
What?

1378
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,570
Oh yeah, that's right.

1379
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,270
Oh, this is hard!

1380
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:58,790
This is hard!

1381
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,420
I guess I could get rid of this now.

1382
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,240
We could get rid of it.

1383
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:18,300
We could get rid of it.

1384
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:42,450
But this like... I don't want to get rid of the mushroom because it's the...

1385
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:47,330
Well, this would also be a way to increase the value.

1386
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,070
You know what I mean?

1387
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:53,890
But...

1388
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:56,050
Uh...

1389
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:57,950
You like the coin?

1390
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:01,090
I like the coin I feel...

1391
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:03,210
I like the extra spin that it gives.

1392
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:05,230
Because sometimes if it gives a last spin...

1393
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:08,110
Then it triggers the hand as well.

1394
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:17,950
We need to have the mushroom with the golden cherry.

1395
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:21,450
You think it'll be enough if we don't have the mushroom?

1396
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:28,730
I mean, I guess I don't have as many spins because I got rid of the cat food, so...

1397
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:32,490
Patrick, thank you so much for the super chat, thank you!

1398
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,060
I think, though, at the very least I should get the cherry.

1399
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,760
The fat guy?

1400
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,400
Plus 3% chance for the ticket modifier to be applied to any shimbo.

1401
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,560
Raises by 1% every time you buy a lucky charm.

1402
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:02,710
Ticket modifier, scoring a symbol with the modifier earns you one ticket.

1403
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,730
Well, let me just get the cherry for now.

1404
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:15,470
This stream has recharged my Mentonium reserves.

1405
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:17,390
Where are they, lol?

1406
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,830
I've been streaming.

1407
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:21,150
But thank you.

1408
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:30,270
I guess I haven't made it to late game enough to know when tickets become so useful, you know.

1409
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:57,930
is just like get more tickets get more tickets don't be low on tickets but i'm like oh i guess for this when you need to reroll huh i suppose when you're on the phone and you need or you need more stuff there and everything uh maybe well i'm i'm not gonna do the other round we're pretty we're pretty good i think so okay

1410
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:07,580
re-rolling in some items cost a lot more tickets oh yeah yeah yeah

1411
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:27,500
I'm gonna I'm gonna deposit we will try golden cherry next round if I want to start uh

1412
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:40,840
I'm also I am reconsidering I don't know yet I don't know I don't know.

1413
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:43,600
We'll figure it out.

1414
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,080
We'll figure it out.

1415
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,780
Oh, scary, scary, scary!

1416
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:50,700
Chonky cat!

1417
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,780
Chonky cat!

1418
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,620
Also, the briefcase.

1419
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,760
Increases charm space!

1420
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,820
Oh my gosh, huge, huge, huge!

1421
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,040
We were hoping for this.

1422
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,680
Nice!

1423
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:11,520
Oh, got something new?

1424
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:15,740
Property certificate.

1425
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,220
Make space for two more lucky charms!

1426
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,680
Should I...

1427
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,680
So the Chonky Cat.

1428
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,260
I could get both.

1429
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,540
I could get the briefcase and the Chonky Cat.

1430
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,280
I'm gonna hold off on the briefcase.

1431
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:31,960
Just in case.

1432
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,020
Might not need it, you know.

1433
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:36,280
Yeah!

1434
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:37,300
Wait, what is it?

1435
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:38,920
Wait, where'd he go?

1436
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:39,500
Oh, there he is.

1437
01:40:40,640 --> 01:41:01,540
whatever seven plus patterns trigger during a spin you earn money equal to double your current interest okay all right okay cat build suddenly okay okay okay briefcase is good for interest that's true oh yeah let me thank you for reminding me let me put my interest away

1438
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:15,360
okay okay okay okay okay i mean like oh that is true that is true Because then we would have way more interest, right?

1439
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,820
You're right.

1440
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:18,960
You're right!

1441
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,160
Let's get it.

1442
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,660
You are now interest build.

1443
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,280
I'm...

1444
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,940
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1445
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:32,720
I'm...

1446
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,000
Build, build.

1447
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:42,900
Yeah.

1448
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,460
The interest will save us.

1449
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,220
Let's go gambling.

1450
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:54,580
Let's go gambling.

1451
01:41:55,120 --> 01:42:02,040
But I need...

1452
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,040
I need...

1453
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,680
Still to rely on cherries?

1454
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,640
Because basically...

1455
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,740
So...

1456
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:21,200
Because with the cat, we need the seven, you know what I mean?

1457
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:26,800
We need like the patterns of seven or higher to unlock Lucky Cat.

1458
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:31,740
Which means we need still things that...

1459
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:38,260
That will trigger more often, you know what I mean?

1460
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:38,820
Like this.

1461
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:50,470
Oh, I got something new!

1462
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:52,850
Good amount.

1463
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,460
So we're still a little bit...

1464
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:10,100
reliance on the cherries it doesn't matter their amount so much but i don't think that was a cat you guys wow

1465
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:34,640
that was a lot of money what did we get personal trainer plus 25 chance for the repetition modifier to be applied to any symbol decreased by 5% at the end of every round 25% Discard has...

1466
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:38,480
Wait, scoring a symbol with this modifier re-triggers patterns containing...

1467
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,400
Interesting, interesting.

1468
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:45,300
What do I have in here?

1469
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:46,440
Oh, the cat food.

1470
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,600
And then this is the book.

1471
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:51,960
Yes, yes, yes.

1472
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:04,080
I think I'm gonna go for it so I can get more tickets.

1473
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,340
What's the value of our cherries?

1474
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,520
44!

1475
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:12,580
What?

1476
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,360
44!

1477
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:19,200
Rewel the shop.

1478
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:19,940
So true!

1479
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:22,560
Wow.

1480
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:24,660
Bell.

1481
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:26,640
Patterns.

1482
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,240
They're kind of lame.

1483
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:34,400
Pentacle.

1484
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:36,140
Symbols multiplier plus one.

1485
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:39,100
This bonus grows by whenever five plus patterns triggers during a spell.

1486
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,390
Is it good for our build though?

1487
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:51,450
Oh, it's permanent.

1488
01:44:51,710 --> 01:44:52,270
Oh, okay.

1489
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:57,610
I'm trying to think of what we can start actually like.

1490
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:10,790
I still think the hand is good because it increases our luck so much by the end that we could, like, trigger not just a jackpot, but kind of like how we got that one clover where it did the seven pattern.

1491
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:16,110
Yeah, mushroom maybe.

1492
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:19,690
Oh, I think a mushroom is time to go.

1493
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:23,990
I think the mushroom is time to go.

1494
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:26,070
You did your job.

1495
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:26,670
Good job.

1496
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:29,650
Good job, mushroom.

1497
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:33,250
Yeah, because now we're actually really reliant.

1498
01:45:33,330 --> 01:45:35,130
Honestly, even the golden cherry.

1499
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:38,250
Even though I just got it.

1500
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:48,030
Because if we're doing more interest stuff now, We need cherry added, but we don't need the cherry number so much, you know?

1501
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:50,730
Like the amount of it, I guess.

1502
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:53,350
Golden cherries for scaling.

1503
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:53,890
Does it?

1504
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:55,850
Oh, it does, doesn't it?

1505
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:57,330
Yeah.

1506
01:45:58,470 --> 01:45:59,110
Okay, it does.

1507
01:45:59,350 --> 01:45:59,670
Never mind.

1508
01:45:59,770 --> 01:45:59,990
You're right.

1509
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:00,310
You're right.

1510
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:00,650
You're right.

1511
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:01,230
Okay.

1512
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:01,670
Never mind.

1513
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:02,210
Just kidding.

1514
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:02,730
You're right.

1515
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:03,050
You're right.

1516
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:03,410
You're right.

1517
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:08,550
I'm thinking about everything else for now.

1518
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:11,390
Gumba gotta go.

1519
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:14,070
Goomba gotta go.

1520
01:46:20,650 --> 01:46:21,210
Did I...

1521
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:21,510
Okay.

1522
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:23,270
I was wondering if I...

1523
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:25,550
I guess it wasn't ringing, so...

1524
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:28,650
Um...

1525
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:29,410
Plus...

1526
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:30,570
Symbols Multiplier.

1527
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:31,250
Plus one.

1528
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:34,070
I'll try it.

1529
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:36,590
I'll get it.

1530
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:39,110
And then I'm gonna get the eight tickets.

1531
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:43,270
Or wait, oh, if I wanna start scaling it.

1532
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:55,400
One more?

1533
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:00,980
You guys are saying re-roll shot, but like, I have no tickets.

1534
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,640
There's no point for me to re-roll.

1535
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,240
There's no point.

1536
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,040
I'll do one more.

1537
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:18,380
Let's go.

1538
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:34,770
Yippee!

1539
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:46,740
Chonky cat.

1540
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,040
What the?

1541
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:49,500
Zombie duck.

1542
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:51,540
I got mailed.

1543
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,040
Oh, so...

1544
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,740
Oh, it did!

1545
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,500
Oh, it did trigger!

1546
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:03,700
Yeah, baby!

1547
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:05,140
Oh, girl!

1548
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:06,960
Thank you so much for the brutal wreck!

1549
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:07,580
Hello!

1550
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:09,540
Hello, everybody!

1551
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,100
We're making money!

1552
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,180
We're gambling!

1553
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:17,180
If you've never played this game, it's so fun, girl.

1554
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:19,160
We're back.

1555
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:20,220
Thank you for the five gifted, donkey.

01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:20,880

Thank you, the champion.

Thank you so much for the gifted!

1559
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:25,180
Okay.

1560
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,400
Oh, I do have another spin.

1561
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,400
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

1562
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:31,640
Oh, wait.

1563
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:33,280
I feel like that...

1564
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,540
Wait, I feel like I had more cherries, and then I...

1565
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:38,480

Wait.

1569
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:21,710
You fell into the clover pit, too, huh?

1570
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:22,430
Oh, yeah.

1571
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:23,690
Wait.

1572
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:26,030
Re-roll for him.

1573
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:32,780
One more?

1574
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,580
Well, I need...

1575
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,580
Tickets anyway, so I'm going to...

1576
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,560
I'm gonna just...

1577
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:49,580
and the...

1578
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,560
One million?

1579
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,780
Oh, thank you so much for the thank you, the thank you!

1580
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:58,320
Oh, we got the little guy!

1581
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:02,920
Double the value of lemons and cherries!

1582
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:05,680
I

1583
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:15,070
love a cherry!

1584
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:19,290
No wonder you can't survive on drinks.

1585
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:20,410
I need supplements!

1586
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,360
Didn't use the book.

1587
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:43,860
It's okay.

1588
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:54,170
I want to spin first.

1589
01:50:57,570 --> 01:50:58,130
Let's go.

1590
01:50:58,130 --> 01:50:58,590
Unlucky?

1591
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:06,990
I always know when they're gonna do the 6-6, if I'm gonna get like a 6 because it starts going real slow.

1592
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:13,530
Yeah, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry!

1593
01:51:27,950 --> 01:51:29,130
Why is it showing up?

1594
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:29,970
more often now.

1595
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:30,350
Huh?

1596
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:31,430
Why is this?

1597
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:31,870
Why?

1598
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:33,390
That's the second time.

1599
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:44,340
Oh, my gosh, I'm wood.

1600
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:49,720
I love how many items are in this game.

1601
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:50,620
It's kind of insane.

1602
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:54,960
Nice.

1603
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,160
Lucky hand!

1604
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:02,230
Oh!

1605
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,920
Oh my god Wait, I've already met

1606
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:42,450
My gosh Wood Plus 35% chance for any cherry Wait, wait, wait Wait, this was made for my Build!

1607
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:49,970

1608
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:52,930

1609
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:57,210
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

1610
01:52:57,870 --> 01:52:58,630
Oh my god!

1611
01:53:00,850 --> 01:53:02,970
Everything's coming up, cherries!

1612
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:04,930
Let's just re-roll.

1613
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:06,710
Cherry.

1614
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:12,790
Free?

1615
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:16,630
Roll.

1616
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:21,380
Bro!

1617
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:28,820
Fruits basket.

1618
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:29,260
Oh!

1619
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,140
I said fruits basket.

1620
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:34,240
Like the anime.

1621
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:47,080
What would I get rid of?

1622
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,640
I don't know what I would get rid of even though.

1623
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:03,380
Coin?

1624
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,520
Yeah, we could probably get rid of the coin.

1625
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:08,440
Got my plushie today!

1626
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:11,300
I can't wait to soak it in milk and throw it against the wall!

1627
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:23,390
It's a limited item.

1628
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:24,030
It does?

1629
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:25,170
Oh, you're right, you're right.

1630
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:25,710
It does.

1631
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:26,770
Oh, no.

1632
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:31,090
I'm gonna... Okay, I'm gonna sell our cat food for now.

1633
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:31,830
Oh, wait.

1634
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:33,250
I forgot I have this book, too.

1635
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:40,290
I'm gonna...

1636
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:44,050
I'm gonna sell the cat food because we don't have the, what's it called anymore?

1637
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:46,470
The, uh...

1638
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:49,710
Oh, what's it called?

1639
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:55,850
Mushroom.

1640
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:00,030
Yeah.

1641
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:01,850
So, and then I'm gonna...

1642
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:03,390
So, I'm gonna...

1643
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:04,310
Throw away.

1644
01:55:06,210 --> 01:55:08,470
And then I'm going to...

1645
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:09,870
Store our coin.

1646
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,560
And then I'm going to try the fruit basket.

1647
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:30,450
I need wood!

1648
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:34,030
That's the goal.

1649
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:35,950
Wood is the goal.

1650
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:37,990
Eye on the...

1651
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:39,850
I...

1652
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:42,450
Oh my god!

1653
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:44,310
Eye on the wood!

1654
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:22,820
Please!

1655
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:24,720
Let me live!

1656
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:29,090
Please!

1657
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:34,290
Oh my god.

1658
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:40,180
Oh my god.

1659
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,060
Ah, not the...

1660
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,580
Wait, no.

1661
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,600
Was

1662
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:01,420
it, it was like not lucky and not...

1663
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:01,840
Oh my god.

1664
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:02,980
Oh my god.

1665
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,400
No, let me just do that real quick.

1666
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,000
Naughty dealer is good.

1667
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:23,960
But I...

1668
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:25,840
Ah, but the one!

1669
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,700
Ditch the hand for the dealer.

1670
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,080
You're- you're- I think you're so right actually.

1671
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1672
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,380
Goodbye hand.

1673
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1674
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:50,320
I'm just gonna go with that.

1675
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:52,660
And I think I'm gonna depart...

1676
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:55,420
Well...

1677
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:57,660
Should I decide if I need to deposit for...

1678
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,200
For more tickets or not?

1679
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:04,780
Save the ink.

1680
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:07,040
What do I have in here again?

1681
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:07,980
Oh yeah, my coin.

1682
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:09,260
Well...

1683
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:16,340
I guess we could keep it in the drawer, huh?

1684
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:22,460
I guess we could keep it in the drawer, and then if we ever need it, we just swap it out, right?

1685
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:24,560
Yeah.

1686
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:26,960
What's in here?

1687
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:27,440
The book?

1688
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:28,660
I'm gonna...

1689
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:31,800
I don't want to get rid of the book, but I think I shall get rid of the book.

1690
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,160
Or...

1691
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,860
The coin, what do you do again?

1692
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:39,680
Oh, wait, sorry.

1693
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:41,220
One extra spin...

1694
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:42,160
Oh, triggers randomly.

1695
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:49,920
I mean, it's 10%, but it's, I feel like it triggered pretty often, but I think it's, yeah, throw away.

1696
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,980
Equip it from the drawer when you lose.

1697
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:01,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1698
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:03,460
It did crazy for 10%.

1699
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:04,340
That's what I'm saying.

1700
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:05,840
That's what I'm saying, but yeah.

1701
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:10,820
I think we need the assurance.

1702
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:13,580
You reach the lucky charms limit.

1703
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:17,680
Oh, I need two space.

1704
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:18,960
Oh!

1705
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:20,900
Ah!

1706
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:23,360
Ah!

1707
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:24,320
Okay.

1708
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:25,820
Ah!

1709
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:28,020
Aw, man.

1710
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:29,600
Okay.

1711
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,340
Well...

1712
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:41,640
Oh, I almost...

1713
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:42,520
Put it in drawer.

1714
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:44,380
Why?

1715
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:47,240
Put it in drawer.

1716
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:50,760
Equip.

1717
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:51,480
Okay.

1718
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:53,680
Okay.

1719
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,180
And I'm gonna re-roll.

1720
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:01,460
The hand's like, you can't get rid of me.

1721
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:05,740
The book is like, you can't get rid of me!

1722
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:13,850
The purse is pretty good.

1723
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:15,810
And it's...

1724
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:17,190
Okay, how about this?

1725
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:20,290
It decreases by 3%.

1726
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:22,470
We put...

1727
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:23,910
Away the...

1728
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:25,570
The D4.

1729
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:27,970
For the purse.

1730
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:41,670
I know the book has interest too There was like please please I'll be better I'll be better But um We put away the D4 for the purse And then once the purse depletes we try to get the wood You know

1731
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:48,710
I think

1732
02:00:52,090 --> 02:01:04,610
That could be our goal Our strategy for right now Alright I'm gonna put away so I can get more Coins We need the wood We need the wood And there's wood!

1733
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:05,070
Okay.

1734
02:01:05,790 --> 02:01:06,450
And there's wood.

1735
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:07,970
There's none.

1736
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:10,030
Cherries?

1737
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:11,490
Uh-oh.

1738
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,250
Speculative trait.

1739
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:13,930
Ah!

1740
02:01:14,370 --> 02:01:15,570
Wait, this actually helps!

1741
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:18,450
Thank you!

1742
02:01:18,890 --> 02:01:20,890
Bring your interest to 30% or more.

1743
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:22,970
What's a D4?

1744
02:01:24,470 --> 02:01:25,890
It's a dice, right?

1745
02:01:29,290 --> 02:01:29,870
The cat!

1746
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:33,510
The cat.

1747
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:36,130
Now the hand is glowing.

1748
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:37,490
Patterns multiplier.

1749
02:01:38,330 --> 02:01:38,570
Yeah.

1750
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:42,970
Let's, let's, um, oh, um.

1751
02:01:46,150 --> 02:01:48,170
Deposit one million coins.

1752
02:01:48,990 --> 02:01:49,970
Not an addiction.

1753
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:52,850
Okay.

1754
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:54,650
All right.

1755
02:01:55,470 --> 02:01:56,290
All right.

1756
02:01:58,450 --> 02:01:59,930
Let's go gambling.

1757
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,070
Let's go gambling.

1758
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:03,950
Oh, I forgot the fruit basket is also gonna...

1759
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:05,910
Deplete.

1760
02:02:09,290 --> 02:02:10,270
Stop it.

1761
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:12,190
Don't do that.

1762
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:13,050
Stop it.

1763
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:17,570
Holy...

1764
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:18,460
Wait, how did I...

1765
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:21,330
Because of the interest multiplier!

1766
02:02:21,970 --> 02:02:23,670
Oh, my dealer...

1767
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:24,550
dealer duck.

1768
02:02:28,330 --> 02:02:29,470
Stop it!

1769
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:31,510
It's only supposed to be 1.5!

1770
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:46,720
Yeah!

1771
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:58,930
Yeah!

1772
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:27,500
Thank you!

1773
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,060
Oh my...

1774
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:37,860
Gosh!

1775
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:42,770
Let's spin.

1776
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:44,630
Or not spin.

1777
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:45,030
Restock?

1778
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:46,050
Oh!

1779
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,960
It's

1780
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:07,240
at 12% This still has five rounds left.

1781
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:11,600
The wood is here, everybody.

1782
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:13,600
Also, it's only one ticket.

1783
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:20,280
Oh, that I need more.

1784
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:26,440
Oh, she's got wood!

1785
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:28,620
Sell the golden cherry.

1786
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,660
I don't know, though.

1787
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:36,640
Because the golden cherry, it stacks, no?

1788
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:37,940
Like, it scales?

1789
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,480
Yeah, we want to keep the golden cherry.

1790
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:44,640
Yeah.

1791
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:46,660
Get rid of the purse.

1792
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,860
Yeah, I think we get rid of the purse.

1793
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:58,020
Yeah, I think we get rid of the purse.

1794
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:05,460
Because...

1795
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,500
The fruit...

1796
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:13,120
So basically, if this has the modifier and it doubles, like that's huge.

1797
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,060
Yeah, Fruit Basket has crazy value on those five uses still.

1798
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,060
I agree, I agree.

1799
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,300
No, you can't buy a drawer.

1800
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,900
What's in here anyway?

1801
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:39,940
Oh, my D4.

1802
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:42,060
And the Ankh.

1803
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,540
Purse will just be useless later.

1804
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,780
Yeah, I know, yeah, so...

1805
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:52,940
I think I'll get rid of the purse.

1806
02:06:02,290 --> 02:06:04,710
Golden Cherry only adds basic value per trigger.

1807
02:06:06,070 --> 02:06:06,750
Am I crazy?

1808
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:09,590
Everyone was telling me it stacks, though.

1809
02:06:09,670 --> 02:06:10,290
Am I crazy?

1810
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:20,320
I'm...

1811
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:21,860
I get so many mixed messages.

1812
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:25,060
I think maybe I just don't understand what it does, like, exactly.

1813
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:30,840
So...

1814
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:34,600
Because we got to 264 because it's been adding the plus 2 every time, no?

1815
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:44,830
We could always get another golden cherry eventually.

1816
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,600
Not good late game.

1817
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:52,160
Oh.

1818
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,120
So if we sold this and then...

1819
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:56,380
You

1820
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:10,150
want multipliers, not addition.

1821
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:11,030
I guess that's fair.

1822
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:17,630
I don't know.

1823
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:21,110
The only thing is because the purse has depleting value.

1824
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:22,610
I'm like, why do I keep it?

1825
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:24,610
Why would I get rid of...

1826
02:07:24,610 --> 02:07:28,930
I mean, I'm sure something else might come along if I still sell the cherry and this is gone.

1827
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:31,450
But...

1828
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:33,870
I think I...

1829
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:36,390
I...

1830
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:36,390
I

1831
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:47,120
could get another purse.

1832
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,820
Yeah, that's so true.

1833
02:07:49,460 --> 02:07:50,140
I'm gonna...

1834
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:51,880
Okay.

1835
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:59,400
I'll get rid of the cherry until the purse is kind of similar to how I was like I'll keep the purse until we get the wood.

1836
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:01,380
We'll keep...

1837
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:04,980
Maybe the purse will stay until we get another cherry or something like that.

1838
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:08,180
You get 20k from cherries and 2m from cats.

1839
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:11,400
The value of cherries isn't going to scale higher than interest.

1840
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:13,860
I guess that's fair, too.

1841
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:17,120
I guess that's fair.

1842
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:18,160
fair too.

1843
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:24,200
Okay, fine.

1844
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,620
Goodbye, Cherry.

1845
02:08:34,830 --> 02:08:36,330
We're wood people now.

1846
02:08:38,190 --> 02:08:39,770
We're wood people now.

1847
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:49,700
I must... Oh my God!

1848
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:51,200
Do you see that amount?

1849
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:53,300
Wait.

1850
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,780
I want to see... I want to see... I want to see it happen.

1851
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:58,160
Let's go.

1852
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:00,500
Oh!

1853
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:04,860
I need another fruit.

1854
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:13,260
I need

1855
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:21,520
another fruit basket.

1856
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:24,320
Oh my god!

1857
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:27,060
The- the wood is already paying off!

1858
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:31,420
The wood!

1859
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:32,340
The wood!

1860
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,320
The wood!

1861
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:33,560
The wood!

1862
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:09,030
Woohoo!

1863
02:10:11,290 --> 02:10:13,590
I got an achievement for that event.

1864
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:17,590
Which was like, get 15...

1865
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:18,950
Oh.

1866
02:10:19,710 --> 02:10:20,950
Oh my god!

1867
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:22,050
Don't do...

1868
02:10:22,050 --> 02:10:23,250
Don't do this to me!

1869
02:10:26,150 --> 02:10:27,870
Oh my god!

1870
02:10:31,170 --> 02:10:33,330
Did we lose our...

1871
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:33,690
No.

1872
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,290
How many... How many do you have left?

1873
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:36,530
Four left, okay.

1874
02:10:52,620 --> 02:10:55,000
I think I'm just gonna...

1875
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:01,140
Is that 144 million?

1876
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:06,820
Is that 144 million?

1877
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:17,820
Wait, before we do that, let's see what we got too.

1878
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:24,720
Oh...

1879
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:27,680
Lucky times at the store are discounted by two.

1880
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:31,860
What's the clicker?

1881
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:33,520
This guy?

1882
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:38,320
Oh, oh, oh, wait!

1883
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:42,240
Wouldn't that replace the fruit basket?

1884
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:46,140
If, uh,

1885
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:50,530
pretty much.

1886
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:52,110
If we got it?

1887
02:11:53,830 --> 02:11:55,230
And they stack!

1888
02:11:58,330 --> 02:11:59,270
What's that?

1889
02:11:59,290 --> 02:12:00,070
What's this guy do?

1890
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:01,070
The Pentacle do again.

1891
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:03,570
Oh, symbols multiplier plus 13.

1892
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:05,390
This bonus grows by one whenever...

1893
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:06,190
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1894
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:10,490
That's pretty huge.

1895
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:13,750
Could be big.

1896
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:20,620
Could be big.

1897
02:12:28,660 --> 02:12:30,340
Pentacle is not as good as Retro, girl.

1898
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:31,780
I think so, too.

1899
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,540
Sell the D4.

1900
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:39,180
I think honestly the D4 is kind of...

1901
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,940
We don't need it anymore.

1902
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:50,300
If we wanted to get the clicker, we could like...

1903
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:53,960
We could put the pentacle in the drawer or something.

1904
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:59,680
That's what I think I'll do.

1905
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:08,760
Oh!

1906
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:15,840
I forgot to do the discount.

1907
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:23,840
Oopsie.

1908
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:27,000
Oopsie.

1909
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:28,740
But I'll still go with three, yeah.

1910
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:30,000
That's what I was thinking, anyway.

1911
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:32,600
Okay.

1912
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:34,320
Let's try this out.

1913
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:35,360
Let's see how...

1914
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:35,600
Oh, wait.

1915
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,040
Just kidding.

1916
02:13:41,510 --> 02:13:41,990
Let's...

1917
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:42,450
Okay.

1918
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:47,410
Our interest is 13 million, so we might be okay.

1919
02:13:49,410 --> 02:13:50,790
Let's go gambling.

1920
02:13:51,110 --> 02:13:52,150
Let's go gambling.

1921
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:54,750
Wait,

1922
02:14:00,230 --> 02:14:01,550
but it's only like plus 500.

1923
02:14:02,610 --> 02:14:02,930
Wait.

1924
02:14:04,210 --> 02:14:05,290
Why is it so low?

1925
02:14:19,690 --> 02:14:20,250
What

1926
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:27,180
is the plus 528 then?

1927
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,040
What am I seeing?

1928
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:11,930
I'm speechless.

1929
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:15,270
I'm just listening to the numbers happening.

1930
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:18,970
I'm just listening to dollar sign go up.

1931
02:15:19,630 --> 02:15:20,330
Why is it so low?

1932
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:23,090
She says, the greed sickens me.

1933
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:26,950
Her greed.

1934
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:28,390
It sickens me!

1935
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:32,870
Thank you for my ticket.

1936
02:15:34,990 --> 02:15:36,390
Oh my guys!

1937
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:38,630
Guys, guys!

1938
02:15:38,930 --> 02:15:40,730
I think you broke it.

1939
02:15:43,350 --> 02:15:44,710
I mean...

1940
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:46,290
We don't know quite yet.

1941
02:15:46,430 --> 02:15:47,910
Thank you so much for the 50!

1942
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:50,550
We don't know.

1943
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:51,850
We don't know quite yet.

1944
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:56,470
I still want to get my...

1945
02:15:56,470 --> 02:15:59,790
Honestly, I want to give more, like, than 50% for charity.

1946
02:16:00,170 --> 02:16:00,930
Money go up!

1947
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:02,270
Money go up!

1948
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:06,370
What's in the shop?

1949
02:16:10,810 --> 02:16:12,470
I'll reroll just for fun.

1950
02:16:19,510 --> 02:16:20,750
Where is this one?

1951
02:16:20,830 --> 02:16:22,450
Last three deadlines and discard this trolley.

1952
02:16:22,770 --> 02:16:24,990
The end of each deadline gives us many...

1953
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:26,350
Oh, the many...

1954
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:27,230
Tickets.

1955
02:16:27,590 --> 02:16:27,750
Yeah.

1956
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:29,710
Wee.

1957
02:16:29,710 --> 02:16:30,090
Yeah.

1958
02:16:32,930 --> 02:16:36,410
Build a surplus because the money requirements are gonna start going be an expo.

1959
02:16:36,510 --> 02:16:37,590
Yeah, I know exactly.

1960
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:41,650
Oh, eight plus.

1961
02:16:41,770 --> 02:16:43,030
Oh yeah, we get plus two now.

1962
02:16:43,170 --> 02:16:43,670
That's right.

1963
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:46,470
Let's go.

1964
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:47,350
Let's go gambling!

1965
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:53,030
How

1966
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:03,810
many more do I have on my fruit basket?

1967
02:17:05,230 --> 02:17:06,030
We'll check.

1968
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:08,750
Two rounds left.

1969
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:11,710
I want to secure a new one, honestly.

1970
02:17:18,730 --> 02:17:20,510
I'm gonna hear the sound of my dreams.

1971
02:17:20,810 --> 02:17:22,090
Oh my god!

1972
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:32,200
Jackpot would be insane right now.

1973
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:34,140
I don't think my luck is high enough.

1974
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:36,880
Unfortunately.

1975
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:49,540
Almost at a billion!

1976
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:57,480
Let's see.

1977
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:01,380
Should I just...

1978
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:04,300
I think I'll just end around here.

1979
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:10,320
Well, I have 11 tickets, but maybe we'll want to reroll, so I'm going to end here, I think.

1980
02:18:11,460 --> 02:18:11,940
Yeah.

1981
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,000
It's okay.

1982
02:18:18,180 --> 02:18:18,860
It's okay, guys.

1983
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:19,300
It's okay.

1984
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:21,740
Holy moly!

1985
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:23,160
So much!

1986
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,380
Oh my gosh.

1987
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,720
Oh my gosh!

1988
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:28,800
Wait.

1989
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:33,260
Double jackpot's value.

1990
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:40,020
Wait, what else do we have?

1991
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:40,400
Oops.

1992
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:44,980
Make space for two more lucky times!

1993
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:47,400
That's kind of huge, actually.

1994
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:51,360
Wait, so it...

1995
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:55,420
Wait, it takes up space but then gives more space?

1996
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:03,480
Wait.

1997
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:05,480
I have to make space for the space.

1998
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,280
I have to make space for more space.

1999
02:19:15,720 --> 02:19:17,280
So it's plus one.

2000
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,120
Okay, okay, okay.

2001
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:20,460
The basket's about to go.

2002
02:19:20,660 --> 02:19:21,020
True.

2003
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:24,200
Oh, it has two rounds left.

2004
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,180
Wait, what about this one?

2005
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:26,000
Oh, oh, wait.

2006
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:26,900
The purse.

2007
02:19:27,060 --> 02:19:27,400
There we go.

2008
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:28,720
Oh, is that three?

2009
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,120
Oh, we can get rid of the purse.

2010
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:33,020
Oh.

2011
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:36,240
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye purse.

2012
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:45,230
Oh, what is that?

2013
02:19:47,130 --> 02:19:48,030
Cardboard house.

2014
02:19:48,510 --> 02:19:48,930
Snake.

2015
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:51,250
Make space for one more lucky time.

2016
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:53,530
This charm will not show up again after usage.

2017
02:19:54,430 --> 02:19:55,790
Oh, and it doesn't take up space!

2018
02:19:56,170 --> 02:19:57,950
Okay, we gotta get the cardboard house.

2019
02:20:01,650 --> 02:20:02,130
Okay.

2020
02:20:03,890 --> 02:20:05,450
I wonder, though, what's your...

2021
02:20:05,470 --> 02:20:08,650
I guess we'll put the Pentacle back up because I quit.

2022
02:20:09,310 --> 02:20:10,130
Because we can.

2023
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:14,410
Okay.

2024
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:17,030
Oh, all right.

2025
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:21,470
And I think for the phone, I'm gonna...

2026
02:20:22,870 --> 02:20:23,010
Re...

2027
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:25,050
Roll.

2028
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:29,370
What, the other charms?

2029
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:33,530
Ew, ew, it's not really anything that I need.

2030
02:20:34,430 --> 02:20:35,290
I'm gonna reroll.

2031
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:40,090
Wait!

2032
02:20:43,230 --> 02:20:44,730
Maybe the obsessive trait?

2033
02:20:48,730 --> 02:20:50,850
Obsessive would probably be good.

2034
02:20:51,150 --> 02:20:51,930
Does it...

2035
02:20:51,930 --> 02:20:53,330
To a random lucky charm.

2036
02:20:56,970 --> 02:20:57,690
So...

2037
02:20:58,650 --> 02:21:00,090
Does it...

2038
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:02,830
Does it trigger to whatever it's...

2039
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:04,490
I'm guessing it triggers to whatever it is.

2040
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:09,240
So...

2041
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:13,200
so it's useless wait

2042
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:23,700
wait it's wait it's good?

2043
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:24,640
Wait how

2044
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:31,590
whatever goes last spin oh so it doesn't matter

2045
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:50,180
okay it's passive okay I was what I was trying to say is I didn't know if it triggered like if it was on the cat if it triggered the cat again or something but it's the last Oh!

2046
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:51,700
Yippee!

2047
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:52,940
Okay.

2048
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:58,620
I'm gonna deposit now.

2049
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:02,880
What I'm gonna do probably this time is all three...

2050
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,140
I don't know.

2051
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:07,160
Do I want the more...

2052
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:11,300
Well, regardless, I don't have enough, so...

2053
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:12,160
Buy a charm.

2054
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:14,840
Well, what... I don't have... I'm not gonna buy a charm.

2055
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:15,860
What are you talking about?

2056
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:22,420
I know I have one more charm space, but I'm not gonna just buy one.

2057
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:23,760
What are you guys talking about?

2058
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:27,340
You guys are silly.

2059
02:22:29,980 --> 02:22:31,040
You guys are silly.

2060
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:36,120
Okay, I'm gonna deposit this.

2061
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:42,740
Okay, we need quite a bit, but deposit one billion coins!

2062
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:43,180
Yippee!

2063
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:43,760
Okay.

2064
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:46,880
Let's go.

2065
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:00,680
Guys, the thing in the drawer, I'm not, I don't need to take it out, it's okay.

2066
02:23:26,860 --> 02:23:29,440
Did I, wait, did I already reach it or?

2067
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:34,760
Oh wow, a rare spin where I got nothing.

2068
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:41,700
13 billion, okay, thank you.

2069
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:51,740
Wow, oh wow, that's so lame!

2070
02:23:54,260 --> 02:23:55,880
Getting nothing is so lame.

2071
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:02,820
200.

2072
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:07,960
I need more fruit basket.

2073
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:10,840
Wait, what if I had double fruit basket?

2074
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,400
What if I got another one and then I double?

2075
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:14,920
You know?

2076
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,040
204.

2077
02:24:18,660 --> 02:24:20,440
Are you, are you...

2078
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:24,700
Are you screwing with me right now?

2079
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:25,340
Game!

2080
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:27,900
Don't... don't mess with me.

2081
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:29,240
Ah!

2082
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:33,760
It's not greed, it's desperation.

2083
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:36,060
Oh yeah, let me deposit.

2084
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:36,580
Thank you.

2085
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:46,440
I think I'm gonna have to go the other two rounds, honestly.

2086
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:49,260
I think I'm gonna have to go.

2087
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:51,760
The other two rounds.

2088
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:59,740
What I'll do is after this, I could reroll.

2089
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:10,400
and then um because I think the fruit basket will be done after this so we will have two extra slots if we get lucky with a re-roll you know

2090
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:34,650
we're not getting such a good I mean we are but like at the same time you know I don't feel confident I don't feel confident though wait I already made quota oh Oh,

2091
02:25:38,130 --> 02:25:45,110
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

2092
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:56,300
oh.

2093
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:57,560
Yippee!

2094
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:00,220
Oh, no, my fruit!

2095
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,880
My fruit, my fruit.

2096
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:07,140
Wait.

2097
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:11,540
Oh, yeah.

2098
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:15,860
Okay, I'm gonna do one re-roll.

2099
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:36,700
Well, I don't need to I don't need to go again, but it would be maybe good to do it Do I save up more money or do I I'm gonna roll And then I'm gonna do another round Yeah

2100
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:46,550
Do these?

2101
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:48,310
These don't stack though, right?

2102
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:53,570
The trainers Like the modifiers, I guess?

2103
02:27:01,260 --> 02:27:03,660
I don't think I will do the cat food.

2104
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:07,360
I think I will do the personal trainer.

2105
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:10,760
Modifiers do not stack.

2106
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:13,400
It will overlap.

2107
02:27:13,580 --> 02:27:14,320
But it'll...

2108
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:16,040
Well...

2109
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:16,600
Yeah.

2110
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:17,960
No, I get what you mean.

2111
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:23,260
Oh, but it's temporary.

2112
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:24,340
I forgot about this.

2113
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:27,400
No.

2114
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:56,710
I have two I have two slots I think I'm still going to go with the personal trainer though I think it's I think having the repetition modifiers honestly good enough

2115
02:28:00,070 --> 02:28:03,230
by both I don't have enough I don't have enough tickets

2116
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:10,120
I'm a celebrity everything.

2117
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:12,480
Ah, yeah.

2118
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:14,620
We'll go with the personal trainer.

2119
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:21,400
And then, I'm going to do another round, but we're going to deposit first.

2120
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:25,740
More interest, more interest.

2121
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:26,900
Oh, yeah.

2122
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:27,660
Oh, well.

2123
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:29,140
That's fine.

2124
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:31,800
Let's go gambling.

2125
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:33,180
Let's go gambling.

2126
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:33,480

Oh, thank goodness.

2132
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:06,060
I think it's good that I did another round.

2133
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:09,250
Unless I lose it all.

2134
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:28,300
Yeah.

2135
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,700
Deposit your coins now!

2136
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:41,960
I have enough.

2137
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:43,700
Don't you worry.

2138
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,260
I've got enough.

2139
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:49,360
Don't you worry.

2140
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:52,200
Don't you worry, your pretty little head.

2141
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:56,420
We've reached the E!

2142
02:29:57,880 --> 02:29:59,320
E, E, E, E.

2143
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:00,840
And I get plus four!

2144
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:04,320
So honestly, not so bad.

2145
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:07,020
E, E, E, E!

2146
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:09,560
What do we got here?

2147
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:12,820
Avid.

2148
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:16,020
I got the D4 back.

2149
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,060
Couldn't do that.

2150
02:30:21,460 --> 02:30:25,260
Double the value of lemons and cherries!

2151
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:27,160
I mean...

2152
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:34,520
I wish I got adds more chance of getting cherries.

2153
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:38,420
Not this late.

2154
02:30:38,740 --> 02:30:40,220
Honestly, I was thinking that.

2155
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:42,440
I wish that's why I was like...

2156
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:45,260
Ha!

2157
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:50,300
But the tickets?

2158
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:56,840
Nah, we're interest people now.

2159
02:30:58,180 --> 02:30:59,440
What do I have here again?

2160
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:02,980
Wonder if I should get the D4.

2161
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:08,660
I think I'll get the tickets, yeah.

2162
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:13,100
I see cherry symbol and I get excited.

2163
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,440
Buy the D4.

2164
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:21,540
Is it worth so much to get it?

2165
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:26,860
I mean, I guess so that you can have a pattern.

2166
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:30,480
I guess so.

2167
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:33,820
You could D4 into a jackpot if I'm so lucky.

2168
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:35,140
I need more luck.

2169
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:38,760
If I am so lucky.

2170
02:31:43,900 --> 02:31:47,860
How much even is this that it's requesting of me?

2171
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:48,680
Look at this!

2172
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:50,180
Almost every single thing!

2173
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:56,580
It's a lot of money, isn't it?

2174
02:32:01,060 --> 02:32:02,540
It saved the run.

2175
02:32:02,700 --> 02:32:03,180
Not the run.

2176
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:04,540
Saved the spin.

2177
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:05,580
I

2178
02:32:10,790 --> 02:32:20,230
need more chances to get cherries.

2179
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:23,130
I couldn't you be a cherry.

2180
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:43,280
More cherry, cherry, cherry, more cherry, cherry, more cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry.

2181
02:32:45,460 --> 02:32:47,340
Are we doing it in the fruit basket?

2182
02:32:51,270 --> 02:32:52,690
Again, again, again!

2183
02:33:00,610 --> 02:33:03,170
Oh, you... I can't... I

2184
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:09,720
was...

2185
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:16,050
So stinking close!

2186
02:33:20,810 --> 02:33:29,400
I think it

2187
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:33,780
liked that.

2188
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:36,880
I think the But she liked that.

2189
02:33:37,740 --> 02:33:39,460
Like, I feel like I'm edging it or something.

2190
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:45,740
I saw a certain rock princess hit 1033.

2191
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:46,820
I bet you...

2192
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:48,260
But you bet what?

2193
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:51,420
Oh

2194
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:58,830
my gosh, she's asking for so much.

2195
02:33:59,510 --> 02:34:00,230
Uh...

2196
02:34:00,230 --> 02:34:01,210
Oh, ah!

2197
02:34:04,130 --> 02:34:04,850
Okay.

2198
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:06,470
We keep going.

2199
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:17,440
Hold on.

2200
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:18,400
I'm...

2201
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:18,780
Thank you.

2202
02:34:23,270 --> 02:34:25,890
If only this were a jackpot!

2203
02:34:26,550 --> 02:34:27,610
I think we got robbed.

2204
02:34:41,950 --> 02:34:43,350
It was no money.

2205
02:34:45,050 --> 02:34:46,290
It was no money.

2206
02:34:46,930 --> 02:34:48,350
Now I got robbed!

2207
02:34:53,610 --> 02:34:55,770
Oh my gosh!

2208
02:34:58,570 --> 02:35:01,450
That was so scary!

2209
02:35:03,730 --> 02:35:05,550
That was so scary!

2210
02:35:09,750 --> 02:35:12,550
Lucky 666 ever, I know!

2211
02:35:14,910 --> 02:35:17,090
I need to go get some more water soon.

2212
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:28,150
We hit E!

2213
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:39,010
Wait, we might make it!

2214
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:43,630
I think we'll make it!

2215
02:35:44,270 --> 02:35:44,570
Maybe.

2216
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:47,350
No, no, no, go!

2217
02:35:49,130 --> 02:35:49,810
Hey!

2218
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:50,830
Hey!

2219
02:35:51,610 --> 02:35:53,510
Why aren't you doing your job?

2220
02:35:53,890 --> 02:35:54,390
Huh?

2221
02:35:57,930 --> 02:36:02,430
Oh, now you choose.

2222
02:36:06,790 --> 02:36:09,010
Imagine if we last it out.

2223
02:36:11,490 --> 02:36:13,130
That's the thrill, baby!

2224
02:36:13,450 --> 02:36:14,590
That's the thrill!

2225
02:36:17,810 --> 02:36:20,130
Do you guys think I should spin?

2226
02:36:20,770 --> 02:36:21,790
Wait, what are you at?

2227
02:36:23,470 --> 02:36:24,830
But this is...

2228
02:36:26,070 --> 02:36:28,890
I kind of want the plus four tickets though.

2229
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:52,120
Wait, what am I...

2230
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:54,180
Oh, I see, I see.

2231
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,340
Oh, okay.

2232
02:36:58,460 --> 02:36:59,900
So we're not quite yet.

2233
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:02,720
Wait, what?

2234
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:06,100
Am I not over?

2235
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:28,880
I don't know how E works.

2236
02:37:36,300 --> 02:37:37,540
I couldn't make it?

2237
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:39,700
Oh, yikes.

2238
02:37:43,140 --> 02:37:44,180
Oh, yikes.

2239
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:47,860
Ugh.

2240
02:37:50,020 --> 02:37:51,840
If I got a jackpot, maybe.

2241
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:55,520
Might be good time for Ankh.

2242
02:37:55,640 --> 02:37:56,660
You were so right.

2243
02:37:58,360 --> 02:37:59,700
I'm gonna move.

2244
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:00,860
I'm gonna take...

2245
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:02,180
Which one do I take, though?

2246
02:38:04,180 --> 02:38:04,720
You're right.

2247
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:05,920
This is a good time for Ankh.

2248
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:07,940
Onk time, onk time.

2249
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,320
D4 is slacking?

2250
02:38:25,580 --> 02:38:27,120
I thought so too, honestly.

2251
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:33,120
But we'll keep it just because it could come in handy.

2252
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:34,440
We'll see.

2253
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:37,160
It could come in handy.

2254
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:39,780
This is too scary.

2255
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:40,640
I need water.

2256
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:43,300
I need water.

2257
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:44,420
I'll be right back.

2258
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:52,920
Paz has joined us.

2259
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:55,720
I didn't realize she snuck in.

2260
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:57,400
Hey!

2261
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:00,340
What are you doing, silly girl?

2262
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:01,280
Okay!

2263
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:03,060
I'm scared!

2264
02:40:04,460 --> 02:40:05,500
I'm scared!

2265
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:07,660
I'm scared!

2266
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:10,060
Oh, God!

2267
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:12,180
Oh, fruit basket!

2268
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:13,640
Ah!

2269
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:19,980
We gotta eat!

2270
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:26,000
We got

2271
02:40:29,380 --> 02:40:30,620
more E!

2272
02:40:36,830 --> 02:40:36,910
E!

2273
02:40:41,330 --> 02:40:46,190
We might, the interest might help us.

2274
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:53,050
But we're also losing at the same time because of the personal trainer.

2275
02:40:53,670 --> 02:40:54,770
Oh, I got a shoe.

2276
02:40:56,370 --> 02:40:58,870
The personal trainer is also depleting, you know?

2277
02:41:02,850 --> 02:41:03,170
Oh!

2278
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:05,810
D4 kind of came in clutch there.

2279
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:20,160
Babe babe.

2280
02:41:20,360 --> 02:41:20,720
Wait.

2281
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:23,080
Are you gonna get mad at me?

2282
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:26,380
Don't get mad at me.

2283
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:27,340
Come on.

2284
02:41:27,380 --> 02:41:27,880
Come on, buddy.

2285
02:41:27,980 --> 02:41:28,840
We're buddies, no?

2286
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:30,160
We're buddies, right?

2287
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:34,720
Come on, I just need a little bit more time!

2288
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:42,240
Well, well, what?

2289
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:44,720
Okay, I have a question if anybody has tried this.

2290
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:47,760
If you...

2291
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:49,820
If you...

2292
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:51,760
What's the word?

2293
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:58,440
If you were like, if it was doing the boop, boop, boop, boop, you know, and it was still in here, do you...

2294
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:01,860
Are you able to switch it out or does it like not let you?

2295
02:42:09,550 --> 02:42:11,810
You can very quickly switch things around.

2296
02:42:12,230 --> 02:42:13,570
Oh, that's kind of exciting.

2297
02:42:14,610 --> 02:42:15,890
That's kind of really exciting.

2298
02:42:16,730 --> 02:42:17,250
Okay, guys.

2299
02:42:17,470 --> 02:42:18,190
Oh, my gosh.

2300
02:42:18,350 --> 02:42:19,990
It's so expensive to reroll.

2301
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:27,580
Wait, what was my mail?

2302
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:28,900
I got the shoe.

2303
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:33,720
Plus 20% chance for any cherry to have a ticket modifier.

2304
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:39,820
Scoring a symbol with this modifier earns you one ticket.

2305
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:40,560
Okay.

2306
02:42:45,100 --> 02:42:46,580
I can reroll.

2307
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:51,040
It's just...

2308
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:52,300
I don't think I should.

2309
02:42:54,180 --> 02:42:56,260
But we have two more...

2310
02:42:56,260 --> 02:43:01,380
We have two more rounds now, so...

2311
02:43:06,930 --> 02:43:08,510
Do it after you're safe.

2312
02:43:08,610 --> 02:43:09,510
I think so, too.

2313
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:14,260
I don't like the E.

2314
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:15,300
It confuses me.

2315
02:43:21,740 --> 02:43:22,220
Okay.

2316
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:24,080
Okay.

2317
02:43:26,240 --> 02:43:28,380
Interest, the interest might save us, honestly.

2318
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:31,120
I think it will save us.

2319
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,040
Oh!

2320
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:35,760
Oh!

2321
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:37,360
Oh!

2322
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:38,480
That was so close!

2323
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:45,380
What, are you mad that you came in here?

2324
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:49,700
She's looking at me with such disdain.

2325
02:43:56,340 --> 02:43:58,560
I got a mega cat.

2326
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:01,260
Wait, this is what I need, right?

2327
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:06,700
Oh my gosh, don't do that to me!

2328
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:11,540
Buff cat.

2329
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:26,580
I want the buff cat.

2330
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:30,320
Oh.

2331
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:36,740
Okay, I think now we actually have enough.

2332
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:37,120
Yay!

2333
02:44:42,410 --> 02:44:42,630
Oh.

2334
02:44:43,530 --> 02:44:43,730
Oh.

2335
02:44:47,730 --> 02:44:47,930
Oh.

2336
02:44:49,370 --> 02:44:49,630
Oh.

2337
02:44:51,110 --> 02:44:51,450
Oh.

2338
02:44:54,930 --> 02:44:56,130
Stop jinxing it.

2339
02:44:56,390 --> 02:44:57,490
Isn't that part of the thrill?

2340
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:10,950
No spans out.

2341
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:13,050
Oh, he's gone!

2342
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:22,510
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone.

2343
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:27,670
Swole cat.

2344
02:45:29,310 --> 02:45:36,530
Whenever 15 plus patterns trigger during a spin you earn money equal to four times your current interest.

2345
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:47,450
15 patterns though, I would need The most cherry build ever.

2346
02:45:49,910 --> 02:45:53,130
I will re-roll once because also we have two slots, so.

2347
02:45:57,550 --> 02:45:59,070
First, free money.

2348
02:46:00,990 --> 02:46:02,310
And then, fruit the basket.

2349
02:46:15,810 --> 02:46:17,590
Do I go for it?

2350
02:46:17,670 --> 02:46:18,650
Well, I have 12.

2351
02:46:24,010 --> 02:46:24,790
tickets, I mean.

2352
02:46:28,110 --> 02:46:28,670
Should we?

2353
02:46:30,430 --> 02:46:31,490
Always roll.

2354
02:46:31,770 --> 02:46:32,050
Okay!

2355
02:46:32,950 --> 02:46:33,310
Okay!

2356
02:46:35,790 --> 02:46:36,510
Oh,

2357
02:46:41,350 --> 02:46:41,850
my pentacle!

2358
02:46:42,130 --> 02:46:43,270
I forgot about it.

2359
02:46:44,010 --> 02:46:44,730
Oopsie!

2360
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:03,000
What was I gonna say?

2361
02:47:05,320 --> 02:47:06,620
Oh my gosh.

2362
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:08,980
Thank you!

2363
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:10,340
Oh my god, please!

2364
02:47:13,820 --> 02:47:15,280
Don't leave me with nothing!

2365
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:21,160
We need more cherries.

2366
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:24,140
Cherries, cherries, we need more cherries!

2367
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:26,820
Okay!

2368
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:37,120
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2369
02:47:37,780 --> 02:47:39,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2370
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:45,120
17!

2371
02:47:47,580 --> 02:47:49,500
I don't know how much this is at all.

2372
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:52,780
What if we get cherries?

2373
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:59,100
Lemons manifest more often.

2374
02:48:06,830 --> 02:48:08,190
A gazillion?

2375
02:48:12,850 --> 02:48:13,950
Hold on.

2376
02:48:14,770 --> 02:48:16,190
One second, more in second.

2377
02:48:17,350 --> 02:48:18,690
What do we have here?

2378
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:21,650
Oh!

2379
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:24,030
I got the cardboard box!

2380
02:48:26,490 --> 02:48:27,530
That's so...

2381
02:48:28,650 --> 02:48:30,900
But, I mean, I'm gonna get it.

2382
02:48:31,950 --> 02:48:32,210
Yeah.

2383
02:48:34,630 --> 02:48:37,130
And then I can equip this as well.

2384
02:48:37,870 --> 02:48:39,430
So I don't forget, you know.

2385
02:48:42,730 --> 02:48:43,390
Um...

2386
02:48:44,210 --> 02:48:44,870
Yahoo!

2387
02:48:46,690 --> 02:48:55,010
wondering if i should like have something like a green pepper you know just kind of on hand get the pepper why not that's what i'm thinking

2388
02:48:58,630 --> 02:49:08,570

2389
02:49:11,890 --> 02:49:21,010

2390
02:49:21,830 --> 02:49:24,090
But we'll have it just for now, because why not?

2391
02:49:25,950 --> 02:49:28,530
And then for this, what do we want to add it to?

2392
02:49:28,990 --> 02:49:29,150
Wait.

2393
02:49:33,090 --> 02:49:34,270
I guess the obsessive.

2394
02:49:35,410 --> 02:49:36,510
I guess obsessive.

2395
02:49:45,990 --> 02:49:48,310
Stop projecting your ideas onto reality.

2396
02:49:51,170 --> 02:49:52,810
What did it add to?

2397
02:49:53,030 --> 02:49:54,610
Oh, Mr. Dilla.

2398
02:49:57,650 --> 02:49:59,570
Hide the fruit first.

2399
02:50:00,050 --> 02:50:00,590
Ah, it's okay.

2400
02:50:00,930 --> 02:50:01,680
It didn't get there.

2401
02:50:09,170 --> 02:50:09,790
Oopsie.

2402
02:50:11,350 --> 02:50:11,710
Um.

2403
02:50:13,910 --> 02:50:14,310
Okie dokie.

2404
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:15,890
Deposit.

2405
02:50:16,630 --> 02:50:17,490
Alright, let's go.

2406
02:50:18,990 --> 02:50:19,230
Oh.

2407
02:50:20,310 --> 02:50:21,750
Let's go gambling.

2408
02:50:22,050 --> 02:50:23,050
Let's go gambling.

2409
02:50:23,330 --> 02:50:30,190
It's kind of interesting that I have nothing right now that is for, uh, with a button, you know?

2410
02:50:32,330 --> 02:50:32,930
Oh!

2411
02:50:33,930 --> 02:50:34,530
Oh!

2412
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:37,810
Nothing with a button right now though.

2413
02:50:38,390 --> 02:50:39,450
Are you winning son?

2414
02:50:40,330 --> 02:50:42,130
Oh, I almost lost.

2415
02:50:42,550 --> 02:50:43,010
Oh,

2416
02:50:46,250 --> 02:50:47,070
so lame.

2417
02:50:47,610 --> 02:50:48,090
Come on.

2418
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:57,360
Never stop projecting game announcements into reality.

2419
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:03,620
How can you guys read these numbers?

2420
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:06,840
I can't tell at all what I have...

2421
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:08,300
What I'm getting anymore.

2422
02:51:09,400 --> 02:51:10,520
I have no idea!

2423
02:51:15,510 --> 02:51:16,150
Again!

2424
02:51:17,150 --> 02:51:17,150
Again!

2425
02:51:17,610 --> 02:51:17,930
Again!

2426
02:51:22,050 --> 02:51:23,770
He means nothing to me.

2427
02:51:23,810 --> 02:51:25,230
I don't understand it at all.

2428
02:51:27,670 --> 02:51:29,330
D4 came in clutch here.

2429
02:51:39,940 --> 02:51:41,320
Oh, it's starting to get a little crazy.

2430
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:43,720
Oh, oh, oh, you're okay.

2431
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:49,220
Why is it do that sometimes?

2432
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:56,060
We get a little worked up, huh?

2433
02:51:56,380 --> 02:51:57,100
Mr. Machine.

2434
02:52:05,860 --> 02:52:08,560
The numbers, what do they mean?

2435
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:10,300
Thank you!

2436
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:14,720
You're holding over 500 trillion.

2437
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:16,060
Really?

2438
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:17,100
But what do I...

2439
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:20,660
What do I need?

2440
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:22,760
I can't read.

2441
02:52:24,620 --> 02:52:26,100
I can't read.

2442
02:52:26,400 --> 02:52:26,840
I don't know.

2443
02:52:29,580 --> 02:52:34,500
Take the first number, add zero, the same amount after the E number.

2444
02:52:35,160 --> 02:52:35,260
Huh?

2445
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:36,520
Huh?

2446
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:37,640
What?

2447
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:39,540
You need a lot more.

2448
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:41,440
Yeah, I think so.

2449
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:51,430
Uh.

2450
02:52:53,130 --> 02:52:54,250
Should I?

2451
02:52:55,550 --> 02:52:56,110
Oh, wait.

2452
02:52:56,190 --> 02:52:57,390
I don't think I can roll.

2453
02:52:58,010 --> 02:52:58,470
Uh-oh.

2454
02:52:59,250 --> 02:53:00,390
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.

2455
02:53:02,730 --> 02:53:03,950
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.

2456
02:53:06,070 --> 02:53:08,110
Oh my gosh, I could only deposit once.

2457
02:53:08,870 --> 02:53:09,370
Oh, no.

2458
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:11,850
Oh, no, we're in trouble.

2459
02:53:13,210 --> 02:53:15,330
Let's go get- Oh, no, we're in trouble!

2460
02:53:16,310 --> 02:53:16,670
Team!

2461
02:53:27,140 --> 02:53:31,640
It means- oh, you guys can try to explain it, but I think I'm just dumb.

2462
02:53:35,240 --> 02:53:38,480
Maybe we'll get a jackpot from the pepper.

2463
02:53:41,360 --> 02:53:43,900
We shall hope, we shall pray.

2464
02:53:46,500 --> 02:53:48,200
That's not a jackpot.

2465
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:01,600
One E number to go up.

2466
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:03,240
Yeah, yeah, that's what I figured.

2467
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:16,720
D4 sleeping on the job.

2468
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:17,420
I know!

2469
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:22,780
I need my pepper to work too.

2470
02:54:27,820 --> 02:54:29,720
I need you to work, please.

2471
02:54:29,760 --> 02:54:30,740
I need more luck.

2472
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:33,480
I need more luck, please.

2473
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:35,360
Oh, this

2474
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:44,020
is so bad.

2475
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:45,180
This is so bad.

2476
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:46,700
This is so bad.

2477
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:49,380
Help!

2478
02:55:02,700 --> 02:55:07,780
Guys, this is just how the slots go.

2479
02:55:09,400 --> 02:55:17,160
You know, sometimes the slots, I like to describe them as a beautiful one.

2480
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:43,200
and all just spinning you round and round in circles and sometimes you score and most times you don't but I love women I love women in their cherries hey

2481
02:56:00,220 --> 02:56:00,460
mr.

2482
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:02,280
dealer ma'am why aren't you working huh

2483
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:09,520
Why aren't you working?

2484
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:11,900
Wait, cancel?

2485
02:56:14,910 --> 02:56:17,070
Oh, this modifier, that's right.

2486
02:56:19,650 --> 02:56:20,130
Jackpot!

2487
02:56:20,670 --> 02:56:21,170
Just kidding!

2488
02:56:34,460 --> 02:56:40,430
I think the pepper also screwed me over.

2489
02:56:42,050 --> 02:56:44,110
This is a thing you just said.

2490
02:56:44,270 --> 02:56:44,690
Yeah?

2491
02:56:46,250 --> 02:56:48,030
Can you imagine?

2492
02:56:50,170 --> 02:56:52,450
Can you imagine?

2493
02:56:53,530 --> 02:56:54,110
Jackpot!

2494
02:56:55,030 --> 02:56:55,250
Wait.

2495
02:56:56,550 --> 02:56:57,710
That's not it.

2496
02:57:00,610 --> 02:57:01,550
That's not it.

2497
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:08,760
That's a lot of zeros.

2498
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:13,980
Ah!

2499
02:57:22,250 --> 02:57:23,910
One jackpot saves the run.

2500
02:57:29,210 --> 02:57:30,450
Guys, this is the last round.

2501
02:57:30,630 --> 02:57:31,110
It's over.

2502
02:57:32,750 --> 02:57:34,150
Unless we get jackpot.

2503
02:57:36,070 --> 02:57:37,470
Unless we get jackpot.

2504
02:57:39,370 --> 02:57:40,170
It's over.

2505
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:49,560
Okay, I'm going to close my eyes.

2506
02:57:50,040 --> 02:57:50,780
I'm not going to look.

2507
02:57:51,180 --> 02:57:52,440
I'm just going to pull the trigger.

2508
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:57,580
Hold on.

2509
02:57:57,620 --> 02:57:58,540
I'm going to let my cat out.

2510
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:03,820
going crazy I'm

2511
02:58:17,090 --> 02:58:32,090

2512
02:59:20,790 --> 02:59:22,030
Good run, everybody.

2513
02:59:22,430 --> 02:59:25,010
Good run, good run, good run, good run.

2514
02:59:26,570 --> 02:59:29,930
I was struggling at the beginning of the stream, but...

2515
02:59:30,910 --> 02:59:31,310
We...

2516
02:59:31,310 --> 02:59:33,330
The challenge is increasing!

2517
02:59:35,030 --> 02:59:35,630
What does that mean?

2518
02:59:37,350 --> 02:59:38,050
Welcome back.

2519
02:59:38,190 --> 02:59:38,890
Time to gamble.

2520
02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:40,670
You already know how it works?

2521
02:59:40,790 --> 02:59:41,210
Come on.

2522
02:59:41,650 --> 02:59:42,750
Wait, let's see what we got.

2523
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:43,490

02:59:47,150 --> 02:59:48,330

02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:50,290

Bilatro.

2529
02:59:54,430 --> 02:59:55,070
Bilatro.

2530
02:59:56,670 --> 02:59:59,630
By the way, try earning a lot of coins.

2531
02:59:59,990 --> 03:00:01,710
I might have a deal for you.

2532
03:00:02,170 --> 03:00:05,250

2533
