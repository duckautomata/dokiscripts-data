No, no, no.

18
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,580
I feel like this is, I feel like honestly so many people have been telling me to get a dual setup.

19
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,220
But at the same time, I'm playing it.

Okay, I'm going to GOG.

56
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,590
I'll just refund the Steam one, because I didn't play it.

57
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,660
I didn't think it would be a problem.

58
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,540
Okay, GOD.

59
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm glad it is on GOD, right?

60
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,740

61
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,440

Search.

65
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,500
The Steam one is broken anyway, is it really?

66
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, I didn't see any of that in the reviews.

67
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,660
I usually check for that.

68
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,840
Um,

69
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,650

70
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,050
I didn't update the client.

71
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,750
And it keeps yelling at me.

72
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,050

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,820

116
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,620
Why can't I...

117
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,010

118
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,730

Okay, let me go get my credit card.

123

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,870
Okay, hold on.

125
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,640

142
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,320
Okay.

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,280
Okay.

144
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,180
That was so...

145
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,360
It was so loud.

146
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,140
It was so loud, I'm so sorry.

147
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,620
Okay, I'll be right back.

148

Okay, I'm back.

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm putting in my credit card information.

150
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,590
Which one is the credit card?

151
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,630
Oh, this is it.

152
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,610
They're both the same color.

153
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:57,710
Pink.

154
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,390
Oh, I put it in!

155
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,190
Wait, where did I just type it?

156
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,790
I used the wrong keyboard!

157
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,210
Oh my god.

158
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,090

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,770
Wait, okay, I didn't have chat open.

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,130
That would have been wild.

161
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,850
I'm crying.

162
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,020
I'm crying.

163
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,540
Okay.

164
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,100
Where did it go?

165
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,740
Okay, there it is.

166
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,990
I'm typing it in.

167
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,420
I'm typing it in.

168
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,760
Oh!

169
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm typing it in.

170
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,300
Check out.

171
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,640
Thank you.

172
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,520
Mint Phantom for buying.

173
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,980
Okay, thank you.

174
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,540
Install the game now.

175
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,420
Oh.

176
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,920
All games.

177
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
Wait, my games.

178
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,840
Owned games.

179
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,280
Harvester.

180
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,300
Install game.

181
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,040
We're installing the game.

182
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,580
Why?

183
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,680
I hope this version works.

184
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,420
Harvester funds.

185
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,160
Oh, thank you.

186
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,380
I think you should put it on your intro screen for 30 seconds.

187
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,600
And we all pretend like stream just started.

188
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,980
Can we do that?

189
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,820
Is it okay?

190
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,580
Can we do that?

191
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,640
I'll pretend that everything's fine.

192
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,680
Yeah?

193
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,220
Wait, how long will it take to...

194
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,400
It's still installing.

195
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,140
This game is actually much bigger than I imagined it.

196
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,200
I guess it's all the FMVs.

197
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,740
Wait, is it loading?

198
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,980
Is it installing?

199
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,280
Wait, what's this mean?

200
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,100
Failed to connect to GOG server!

201
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,500
ReTroy!

202
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,080
No!

203
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Oh my god!

204
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,700
Wait, it's actually...

205
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,140
It's not installing!

206
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,840
Oh my god!

207
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,640
Wait, it's actually...

208
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,660
Internet out!

209
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,500
What is how it happened?

210
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,940
Oh my god.

211
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,200
Wait.

212
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,620
I can't.

213
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,560
Amazon AWS down?

214
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,280
Oh.

215
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,130
Oh.

216
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,550
It shouldn't be down.

217
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,350
I just bought something off of Amazon earlier.

218
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,610
Retry.

219
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:35,490

It's going, it's going!

222
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,060
Ah!

223
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,140
Okay.

224
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,020
Alright, I restart stream.

225
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,280
Okay, we're almost at 50%, so, uh...

226
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,140
Okay, uh, redo!

227
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,050
Why isn't it showing up?

228
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,070
Oh, I hit it, that's why.

229
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,310
Welcome to Harvest, population 51!

230
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,730
Oh,

231
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,730
this is a stream where everything will go right and has been gone.

232
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,510
going right.

233
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,210
has and will go right.

234
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,530
Whoa, through the legs.

235
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,010
Why did the aspect ratio become so strange?

236
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,250
Let's have a fun time.

237
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:02,790
Whoa!

238
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,430
Whoa!

239
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,450
By reading this super chat, you have changed your luck.

240
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,670
Which way?

241
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,490
Love this game and I love you.

242
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,370
Really?

243
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,310
So much.

244
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,630
So many of you.

245
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,790
Well, that shit ends with directed by Hideo Kojima.

246
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,850
That would be the greatest twist of all time.

247
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,180
It would be so awesome.

248
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,820
That was the audio, by the way.

249
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,140
Looks like a Sims neighborhood.

250
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,680
Okay.

251
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,560
Oh my god.

252
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,760
I asked about the audio.

253
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,440
Like...

254
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:25,900
Okay.

255
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,440
Okay.

256
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,060
Okay.

257
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:28,980
Okay.

258
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,310
Thank goodness you put on a shirt.

259
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,330
I was scared for a second.

260
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,290
He's humongous!

261
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,890
His room is also slanted.

262
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,350
Ah, here we are!

263
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,530
Harvester gameplay tips.

264
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,050
You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose.

265
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,010
But you can't pick your friend's nose.

266
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,170
Okay!

267
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,130
Wait a second, I just realized the game is cut off, so...

268
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,030
There we go.

269
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,020
That should be...

270
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,600
I'll scoot over a little bit.

271
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,320
That should be good.

272
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,470
One second.

273
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,150
I'm redoing my setup.

274
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,210
Um.

275
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,390
Yeah, we'll keep the tips on.

276
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,650
Yes, I can.

277
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,510
Come here, Minto.

278
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,710
No!

279
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,570
Right-clicking on some objects in inventory show a close-up of that object.

280
00:31:57,390 --> 00:33:05,230

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,000

283
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,060
Oh!

284
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:32,820
Oh!

285
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,340
Middle punch, low punch.

286
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,280
High punch, middle punch, low punch.

287
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,740
So good!

288
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,780
Paper doll by the Mills brother sits on the turntable.

289
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,240
It doesn't...

290
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,060
Okay, it does examine the clarinet.

291
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,280
Obviously some fat high school girl left it there.

292
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,810
What if they draw...

293
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,790
Wait, put him on MS Paint to slow damage.

294
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,870
Why did he say that like that?

295
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:22,730
A handful of faded hardbacks litter the lower shelf.

296
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,510
Is this your bed?

297
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,550
The mattress is speckled with odd stains.

298
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:34,650
A pair of plastic binoculars with the lenses melted to the table.

299
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,030
Not the acne medicine!

300
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,110
An empty acne medicine container!

301
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,030
Can we take it?

302
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:43,550
Nope.

303
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,870
Oh my

304
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,450
god.

305
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,730
A photo of a beautiful girl, blonde, about 17 years old.

306
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,410
She can't play this game.

307
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,930
Examine the pinup.

308
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,970
A sexy pinup.

309
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,330
Woo-wee!

310
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,240
Yeah!

311
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,040
The official Dust Bowl Basketball.

312
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,020
Autographed by GPL.

313
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,360
I want to take some stuff.

314
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,700
An empty trash can so clean you could eat from it.

315
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,620
This dresser drawer is unlocked.

316
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,280
We'll open it.

317
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:34,980
Oh, there we go.

318
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,760
We've got a quarter.

319
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,000
Date of 1952.

320
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,620
Take that.

321
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,040
Okay, never mind.

322
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,380
Wait.

323
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,700
Pick up the quarter.

324
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,500
Ah, I got it.

325
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,080
I got it.

326
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,560
The protagonist is the true horror already.

327
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,340
We love games like that, though, don't we?

328
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,080
I tried searching Minto instead of Mint, and apparently there's a small town in Canada called Minto.

329
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,480
My sunglasses?

330
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,860
As of yet, the future isn't so bright.

331
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:05,680
Yeesh.

332
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,360
This game looks so goosebumps, I'm having childhood flashbacks.

333
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,820
A pen.

334
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,840
Shoe marks are visible at the end of this ballpoint pen.

335
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,960
Pick it up.

336
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,400
Okay, we'll take it with us.

337
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,380
Anything else in here?

338
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,700
I like the please wait.

339
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,660
He's got the cuck chair in his own room.

340
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:33,260
A cheap folding chair such as you find at swap meets bingo parlors and other religious gatherings.

341
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,860
Seven flannel shirts accompanied with matching blue jeans are hanging neatly in the closet.

342
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,940
Oh, he's got a plant and everything.

343
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,980
A recently watered plastic...

344
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,700
Why did you walk...

345
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:48,860
Wait.

346
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,320
This game is silly.

347
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,420
One of your typical wall clocks.

348
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,640
I like looking at everything.

349
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:55,840
Oh no.

350
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,380
I'm a looker, you guys.

351
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,600
P-47 Thunderbolt!

352
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,660
A 148th scale P-47 Thunderbolt with a broken propeller.

353
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,260
Ah.

354
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,580
And he's got a P-51 Mustang.

355
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,380
There's a town in Australia called Minto, too.

356
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,580
Apparently it's not very nice.

357
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,420
Aw.

358
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,840
What?

359
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,880
What do you mean?

360
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,800
Okay.

361
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,960
Let's leave.

362
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,620
The walking is so...

363
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,060
Why is he standing there like that?

364
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,520
A stunning depiction of the earth made of paper mache.

365
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,200
Who are you?

366
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,300
Leave me alone, Steve, or I'll tell Mom on you.

367
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,180
What other?

368
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,640
What can I say?

369
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,380
Wait, I could say whatever I want?

370
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,660
Stupid.

retro.

374
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,480
It means...

375
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,320
It means...

376
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,980
Oh, man, I know what I mean.

377
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:58,760
Uh-oh.

378
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,740
That everything here is wrong.

379
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,120
But I can't picture the difference.

380
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,440
Then shut up and quit bugging me.

381
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,260
It's so wide.

382
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,900
I want some trouble shut.

383
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,000
Congratulations on the marriage.

384
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,780
Oh, he's got that ultra-wide screen.

385
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,820
It just... it takes up like this amount.

386
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,800
Have you noticed that your show isn't black and white?

387
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,940
What else?

388
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,840
Color?

389
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,160
a TV?

390
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,500
Well, I think I've seen a color television before.

391
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,560
Have not.

392
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,860
What did it run on a TV?

393
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,820
41.9.

394
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,360
Look at that.

395
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,340
Your mother lets you watch this stuff?

396
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,340
Sure.

397
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,980
This is part of history.

398
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,920
Part of history.

399
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,920
In America, great.

400
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,100
And besides, blood and guts are needed.

401
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,460
Blood and guts.

402
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,660
Oh, you're right.

403
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,200
That is really neat.

404
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,600
We could be an ultra psycho, or we could say little kids shouldn't watch violence.

405
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
Yeah, we'll say it's Nito.

406
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,520
I'm glad you're catching on, Steve.

407
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,360
You're not too bad.

408
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,060
Well, lousy rat.

409
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,740
The audio is so...

410
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,240
Okay, bye.

411
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:04,820
Good.

412
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,920
Final.

413
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,440
Oh, my gosh.

414
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,200
Pendulum-driven cuckoo clock with the cuckoo oddly absent.

415
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,840
Oh!

416
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,620
Fine bone china?

417
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,060
Gleams from the mahogany shelves.

418
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:49,440

Or not.

420
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,940
Mom.

421
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,380
Wait, there's a baby!

422
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,060
A newborn is sleeping soundly.

423
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,380
How old am I?

424
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,780
How old am I?

425
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,340
This is my mom and she has a newborn.

426
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,860
Say the F word to the mom.

427
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,100
There's a unique dialogue.

428
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,020
Oh, cool.

429
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,480
Expertly embroidered old-fashioned wall plaque.

430
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,960
These cookies are hot out of the oven.

431
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,840
Well, hello there.

432
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,200
How about some cookies?

433
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,060
There's plenty of rejects in the trash.

434
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,300
Who are you?

435
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,920
That's a fine way to talk to your mother.

436
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,140
You're my mother?

437
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,440
That's right.

438
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,560
Though sometimes I get treated like the hired help around here.

439
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,840
I don't remember you.

440
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,360
Of course you don't.

441
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,360
Until you need your socks washed.

442
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,900
No, you don't understand.

443
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,720
I can't remember where I am or even who I am.

444
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,760
Landsake, stop your joshing, won't you?

445
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,180
Yeah.

446
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,680
Steve, I thought you'd grow up a little after graduation.

447
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,360
I only hope that new job will plant your feet on the ground.

448
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,260
So that's my name.

449
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,540
Steve.

450
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,400
Steve.

451
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,980
Your name will be M-U-D.

452
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,540
Mudd!

453
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:03,940
The...

454
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,320
Listen.

455
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,320
This may sound strange.

456
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,420
Kitchen is...

457
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,820
But I've lost my memory.

458
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,660
So loud.

459
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,080
Do you believe me?

460
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,580
Well, you always were a kidder, Steve.

461
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,780
I'm serious.

462
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:15,960
Sure.

463
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,840
And next, you'll be telling me you don't remember Hank and your little...

464
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:51,710
little sister oh gosh okay there's so much I don't know Hank but my little sister you always were a kidder when did I graduate four months ago as if you could forget that what college college a high school diploma is all you need to get a job and besides you can't marry Stephanie if you're going to waste your time going to college 18 years old and you're just now getting your first job What the?

465
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,530
Better late than never.

466
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,650
I guess we can thank Stephanie for that.

467
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,570
What, Stephanie?

468
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,610
Is that my girlfriend?

469
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:00,990
And just who is Stephanie?

470
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,210
Don't you dare toy with that sweet girl.

471
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:10,390
If you started on her with all this amnesia poop, she'll think her fiance is having second thoughts about the wedding.

472
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,490
I don't know.

473
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,370
I don't know.

474
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,490
Wait, okay, hold on.

475
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,290
I'm gonna save.

476
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,410
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

477
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,850
You know how he gets.

478
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,050
This is this menu.

479
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,570
Save game.

480
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,270
Wow, they gave us 25 saves.

481
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:36,610
Save.

482
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,410
Right?

483
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:38,970
Save.

484
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,310
Did it save?

485
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,090
Did that work?

486
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,290
I can't quite tell.

487
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,350
Save?

488
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,070
Oh, I'm stuck in this.

489
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:48,430
I'm stuck.

490
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,410
I'm stuck down here.

491
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,450
Oh, I have to give it a name!

492
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:57,270
Uh...

493
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:58,970
I...

494
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,910
I am Steve.

495
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,630
It's not Steven, sorry.

496
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:08,490
Okay.

497
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:11,090
Um...

498
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,250
What else we got in here?

499
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,870
I am Steven.

500
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,670
Oh, I messed it up!

501
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,170
Oh, I told you I'm busy, Steve.

502
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:28,130
Why don't you talk to Hank or go next door and visit Stephanie or go get an early start on your new job?

503
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,590
If I say...

504
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,830
Guys, this is something that I need to censor if I say the...

505
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,750
If I say F word to her.

506
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,250
Flint and Steel is the F word.

507
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,130
Don't look up what happened to the actor who plays Steve.

508
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,330
Um, I think...

509
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,430
Okay, I definitely saw some people...

510
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,830
Saying that in pre-chat, I think you guys need to learn what the Streisand effect is.

511
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:54,970
If you...

512
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,330
I would have never looked up this guy.

513
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,790
I don't really care about the actor.

514
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,010
I would have never had a reason if everybody in the chat wasn't like, don't!

515
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,590
It's like, don't play this game at 3 a.m.

516
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,310
What does that mean?

517
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,450
The Streisand effect?

518
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:47,670
so basically barbara strizam was just like they what okay i might get the story wrong but her house was on like google or something and she was like stop looking at my house don't you dare look at my house and was trying to get her house taken down and and it made everyone be like oh so why well now i need to know why you want me to go look or you don't want me to look at your house.

519
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,870
Yeah, trying to hide something will bring more attention to it.

520
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,450
Yeah, if you come in, you're just like...

521
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,570
Or you're like, Hey, don't do this thing.

522
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:05,930
But yeah, whatever.

523
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:08,490
Um...

524
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,550
I was listening to the pre-chat craziness on the way home.

525
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:12,310
What did it say?

526
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,570
Good job fighting through the craziness.

527
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,230
Thank you!

528
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:15,750
Okay, what was it?

529
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,090
Oh, yeah.

530
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,430
Okay, so...

531
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,670
So I don't need to censor.

532
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,290
We can just say...

533
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,470
We can just say it.

534
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,510
Can I say that?

535
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,190
Will it work?

536
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,070
Stop speaking nonsense, dear.

537
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,650
Oh, do I just say the regular word?

538
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,640
It's like when Mint tells us not to call her Q.

539
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,680
Just the word.

540
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,740
What a thing to say to your mother.

541
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,160
Was that an invitation now that your father is out of action?

542
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:52,620
Um...

543
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,540
I didn't mean it.

544
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,640
Wait.

545
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,510
YouTube's gonna take down my channel.

546
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,010
YouTube's gonna take down my channel!

547
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,700
I'm kind of scared though.

548
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,660
What if I said... I'm kind of scared... I'm so curious about saying yes.

549
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,040
But I'm scared.

550
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,840
Press one.

551
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,740
Maybe later, dear.

552
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,000
Right now, I have housework to do.

553
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,180
So you can watch if you want.

554
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,440
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

555
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,720
You know how he gets.

556
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,740
She just changes it so fast.

557
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,560
The subject.

558
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,700
Mom?

559
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,100
Mom?

560
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,360
It's full of junk mail bills and bake sale flyers.

561
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,600
Is this Jimmy?

562
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,760
Jimmy James!

563
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,180
Hey, Steve, I'm Jimmy James.

564
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:00,940
Remember me?

565
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,260
I guess not.

566
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,060
Hey, how come you haven't been putting the paper out for me in the morning?

567
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,280
Hey, Steve, I'm Jimmy James.

568
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,280
You remember me?

569
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,060
Why'd they hire an actual child for this game?

570
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,560
Sweet home, Alabama.

571
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,380
Hey, Steve, I'm Jimmy James.

572
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,640

575
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,000
Sh-neakers.

576
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,200
I'm in this mood every day, as worn holes in mine.

577
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,680
Say, you got any spare sneakers?

578
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,940
You got any spare sneakers?

579
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,340

00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,640
Look, you funny.

582
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,760
I'd be willing to trade you for him.

583
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,460
Something really neat of.

584
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,640
Think about it.

585
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,200
See you later, alligator.

586
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,100
In a while, crocodile.

587
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,400
Wait, there's a frisbee up there.

588
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,600
A dayglow Lima Space Disc.

589
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,260
Stuck on the roof.

590
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,760
What's wrong with the air conditioner?

591
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,100
An army surplus air conditioner.

592
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,040
Okay.

593
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:33,800
Can I...

594
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,520
Oh, I can leave.

595
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,940
The way he walks.

596
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:37,760
Whoa!

597
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,300
Whoa.

598
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,840
Oh, wait.

599
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,920
Where did I just go?

600
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,380
Oh, what's happening?

601
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,600
I think I went to the military base on accident.

602
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,600
This air...

603
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,100
This air...

604
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,840

00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,240
W-2.

608
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,000
When I got my lower torso shot off in the war.

609
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,860
Those penny wastes in Washington wanted to stick me behind a desk.

610
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,880
To hell with that.

611
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,420
They owed me.

612
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,960
I left my legs in Dusseldorf.

613
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,680
I thought he was sitting crisscross applesaued.

614
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:52,400
Of course, they felt that after the trauma of having to crawl from Germany to England trailing my intestines behind me, I was too emotionally unstable to continue in the military.

615
00:52:52,400 --> 00:53:54,720

620
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,160

621
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,120
Okay.

622
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,960
The meatplat.

623
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,790
Whatever that kid Stevie's gone.

624
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,950
I think this place is a little cooked.

625
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,570
Okay.

626
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,310
Well, her mom is strange.

627
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:28,570
Everything is strange.

628
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,370
Everyone keeps telling me to save.

629
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,090
We'll keep saving on I.

630
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:33,770
I'm Steve.

631
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:36,790
Jimmy.

632
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,270
What did I call him?

633
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:39,910
Jimmy James.

634
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,210
Tall girl Vanessa, welcome to Mamba Chef.

635
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,810
Thank you.

636
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,470
Well, I guess we just leave.

637
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:47,330
What else do I have?

638
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:53,630
Wait.

639
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,250
Oh, do I need to put the paper out?

640
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,910
It wouldn't let me re-grab it.

641
00:54:59,310 --> 00:54:59,690
Let me try.

642
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,090
Oh, don't worry.

643
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,630
I'm going to do multiple saves, you guys.

644
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,190
Don't worry.

645
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:07,610
I understand when you guys tell me to do saves, it should be multiple.

646
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:08,330
But...

647
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,590
Oh, no, it doesn't let me.

648
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,410
Hmm.

649
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:15,210
But just because we didn't do anything, that's why I saved it again.

650
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,590
Air-conditioned.

651
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,650
The tired air conditioner weezes in the unseasonal heat.

652
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:28,470
Yum.

00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,260
Wait, hold on.

685
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,680
If I click my inventory, okay, we got the quarter.

686
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,760
Use quarter on Ms. Phelps.

687
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:24,500
Ah-ha!

688
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,760
The only thing a quarter will buy you is an adult magazine.

689
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,980
A girly magazine?

690
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,040
Why, Steve, I'm surprised at you.

691
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,560
I'd expect that sort of thing from Deputy Loomis, but never from you.

692
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:41,800
He's always coming in here, ogling the girly magazines behind my counter.

693
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,340
Darned if I'd sell him one though.

694
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,720
I know his wife for heaven's sakes.

695
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,300
Oh Well, will you sell me one?

696
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,280
Certainly will Steve.

697
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:58,080
That kind of interest is healthy for a young fellow Stairs him away from being a fireman.

698
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,580
What's wrong with being a fireman?

699
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:10,080
Water cooler dead roaches and bits of arid grit coat the water cooler's bone-dry reservoir.

700
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,540
Ew Wait, so now I have a magazine.

701
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:14,660
I'll see Let's check it out.

702
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,600
Let's read it in public.

703
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,260
Come here.

704
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,640
Come here, Steve.

705
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:18,500
All right.

706
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,790
Wait, how do I, uh, I think it's right click.

707
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,070
Dang it.

708
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,330
Oh, I do have the newspaper!

709
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:31,950
Let's go back home.

710
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,890
I'll put the newspaper out, I suppose.

711
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:42,600
Somewhere.

712
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:49,470
Well, that didn't work.

713
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:50,390
Oh, okay.

714
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:51,350
Okay?

715
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:52,730
Okay.

716
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:53,210
Okay.

717
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:54,570
Just kidding.

718
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:57,630
Alright.

719
01:00:58,410 --> 01:00:59,470
Let's go to...

720
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,310
Where did she say?

721
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,290
There was like some guy.

722
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,990
Let's just go everywhere.

723
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:06,870
Okay.

724
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,610
41% off packing peanuts.

725
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:10,830
Nice.

726
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,650
Be a pal and put the magazine out.

727
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,210
Well.

728
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:19,790
Examine the woman.

729
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,370
A blind woman is trying to read her...

730
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:29,850
His mailbox is...

731
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:39,170
seem hardly used yes I need some help mr.

732
01:01:39,890 --> 01:02:03,150
postmaster Boyle what can I do for you today assorted colors I'd like a lodge application oh wait what is that for sorry youngster we're out of applications right now come on you must have one around here somewhere well I do have the master but you can't write on that and I only make copies once a month on the button,

733
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,510
regulars, clockwork.

734
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,930
Adjust my seat.

735
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:07,370
Okay.

736
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:09,670
Oh, a job.

737
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:13,010
Come on, I won't kill you to make a lousy copy.

738
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:15,030
Wait, we can do it for free at the general store.

739
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,310
It's not the effort, son.

740
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,650
It's the principle.

741
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:18,790
He's angry at me.

742
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,130
We must adhere to our standards.

743
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:23,530
They're all that stand between civilization and chaos.

744
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:24,950
I'm sorry.

745
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,670
You'll just have to come back in a month, same as anyone else.

746
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,470
And even then, I can't guarantee you'll get an application.

747
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:33,990
The line is always long, and there are never enough to go around.

748
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,330
It's very important that I get in quickly.

749
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,110
That's what they all say.

750
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:38,470
Why?

751
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,630
Post-Mester Boyle, I'll just die if I don't get into the lodge.

752
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,590
I can't make an exception, young man.

753
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,290
It just wouldn't be right.

754
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,280
Uh, lodge.

755
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,880
I certainly don't wish to discourage you from joining, young man.

756
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,080
That's just what you should be striving for.

757
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,620
But I can't break the rules for you.

758
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:33,240

759
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,240
Exit.

760
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,900
Here's a man of principal here.

761
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,080
What's at the barbershop?

762
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,360
This nice little trees here.

763
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:50,900
Okay.

764
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,960
Where's the sheep's...

765
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,420
Was that an alien?

766
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,000
Oh, yeah.

767
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,880
An unfortunate extraterrestrial who journeyed hundreds of light years to wind up mounted on a barber's wall.

768
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,680
Okay.

769
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:08,920
Sheep.

770
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:14,120
I mean, I meant, oh, except for its occasional hairball cough, it's hard to tell if the sheep is alive or not.

771
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,030
Pokemon music.

772
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:26,290
He must be a volunteer fireman on the side.

773
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:26,670
True!

774
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,350
Look at that.

775
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,990
Sculpture made of solidified moose and sticky hairspray.

776
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:36,010
This lovely mannequin is a work of art.

777
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,030
There's so much going on in here.

778
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,830
It's a picture of Mr. Pastroli as a young buck.

779
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,630
I like how the sheep is part of the OST.

780
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,170
Fargo, thank you so much for the fact it did.

781
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:54,370
Thank you.

782
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,610
Okay, we'll start with Mr. Pastorelli.

783
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,750
Mr. Pastorelli doesn't respond.

784
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,130
Not understanding English.

785
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:01,630
No!

786
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,290
What about you, Mr. Swell?

787
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:05,830
Howdy, Steve.

788
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,810
Howdy.

789
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,870
Howdy back, Mr. Pete Swell, Steve.

790
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:12,690
Don't you pull my old leg now?

791
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,050
What takes place inside of every barber shop?

792
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,350
Change your mind about that aluminum siding.

793
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:17,570
What are you talking about?

794
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,110
What?

795
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:21,430
I really think you should talk your father into buying some.

796
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:23,250
He can afford it.

797
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:28,210
And I can't stress enough the value on some really fine aluminum siding.

798
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:28,390
Yeah, his eyes are.

799
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:34,410
It keeps it warm in the summer, cool in the winter, and it keeps out the shoes.

800
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:40,090
Pastorelli oughta look into some, but I can't get him to understand the word I say.

801
01:05:41,310 --> 01:06:12,670
this is so bad the sheep I'm curious about the sheep can't no sorry I clicked too fast he just said can't aluminum side a pastorelli click pastorelli's a rubed from way back ask Clem Parsons how he followed up with oh I can type it in I could fix it for him,

802
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:14,610
but he just won't listen.

803
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,190
Cheap.

804
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:18,590
Wait.

805
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:21,250
Sometimes the clicking is a little, you know.

806
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:25,450
Can't understand why Pastorelli keeps that nasty thing in here.

807
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,490
Must remind him of the pastures in Italy.

808
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,870
Kind of like why I keep wrenches under my pillow.

809
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,270
So as I can dream about plumbing.

810
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:37,750
So as I can dream about plumbing.

811
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:39,030
Blumbing?

812
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:40,350
Well.

813
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:47,390
I've seen the end coming for the aluminum siding game, so I took a mail course and learned how to be a plumber.

814
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:51,630
Now, there's a business that never lets up.

815
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:55,150
You'd be surprised what people flushed down the toilet.

816
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,390
That is so true.

817
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,890
Goodbye.

818
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,090
Nice to see you again, Steve.

819
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,170
He was nice.

820
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,690
Mr. Parsons.

821
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:04,490
Hello there, youngster.

822
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,110
They say them aliens I was telling you about.

823
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:08,650
Well, they came back last night.

824
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:41,590

825
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,570
wrapped all special-like.

826
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:46,010
Ooh, oh, that's so cute.

827
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,770
Colored glass with some bulbs stuck up in it.

828
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,990
Buddy thinks it's to be all-in-all.

829
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:54,890
Installed that alarm system just to protect it.

830
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:59,290
Though who in tarnation did want to steal a worthless piece of junk like that?

831
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,630
The aliens, the aliens.

832
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:01,590
Maybe an alien, friend?

833
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,310
Oh, Pete, don't be ignorant.

834
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:08,610
Them aliens don't give a fig for no colored glass.

835
01:08:09,770 --> 01:09:08,050
build spaceships they can't make a bad gum barber pole crazy hit don't know nothing about science the science wait what about more what about aliens aliens well son the ways of the alien is a specialized area would craft the known thank you so much for the fight what you got to remember is your average alien is smarter than your average human so you got to be extra careful building you're blind if you want a bag one you hunt aliens son after nailing an alien you can never go back to quail what you think you can get one of those that has swapped me you know when you like line you're blind with lead to fool their sensing machines lady eating the aliens preferably in the woods around the nuclear base oh they love messing around out there why not wait outside your field,

836
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,550
Clem.

837
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:11,350
Wait for them to come a carving.

838
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:15,830
Oh, they do their crop doodles with zap guns you darn full, don't you know nothing?

839
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:19,470
Besides, ain't no place to put the blind out in the field.

840
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,690
Now, you listen to Clem Parsons if you want to tag an unearthly being.

841
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:24,430
I see.

842
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:34,730
They cross the void, wondering what lies beyond, all the time not knowing that what awaits them is buckshot.

843
01:09:35,090 --> 01:10:39,190
The aliens face looks like when I'm like messing around in the Sims and I make their their mouth really really small so what about alarm system I feel like we need to know the alarm system if we have to break in here eventually maybe probably pasty rarely shelled out for an alarm system all right but he's too cheap to hire an electrician to hook her up dang idiot crosswired it through the fire sprinkler and the alarm goes off it sets the sprinkler oh no tarnation tarnation aliens looking for intelligent life ought to stay away from this shop sure enough oh it's so mean okay bye anytime steve what is this behind them i'm trying clem parsons took this rare photograph of an extraterrestrial okay this is not what i expected of the barber shop but um very cool After playing Mass Effect,

844
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:42,790
it really isn't the same after you've nailed one of them aliens.

845
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,670
Are you also eating aliens?

846
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,430
The Lodge!

847
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:51,370
This is the place we're trying to get in.

848
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,280
Okay.

849
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,970
We didn't really do anything, so I'll just keep saving.

850
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:12,190
Only initiates may enter the Hall of the Order of the Harvest.

851
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:42,730
moon did you say something i did not speak but my mind touched yours telepathy but how only those who seek enlightenment warrant my attention do you hunger for true knowledge yes i'd like to join the lodge there are always obstacles to the path you must First,

852
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:48,350
you fill out an application to be considered for initiation into the mysteries.

853
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:51,370
Paperwork?

854
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:52,470
Yeah, paperwork?

855
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:57,690
Members of the Order are privy to many hidden truths.

856
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:00,750
You have telepathy and you're making me do paperwork?

857
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:04,870
They know what the trees whisper to the wind to make it howl.

858
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,620
The worm knows as it squirms in a rotting leg.

859
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,660
They know what you've found.

860
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:44,500
gotten wait you you know i think i can live without no no you're talking about my amnesia when you find the truth will be revealed to you when you possess the truth you will know what you knew and if anything remains forgotten then it was never worth the knowing okay interesting looks like it looks as ancient as the building itself I think you've got,

861
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,540
like, a rat problem.

862
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,140
Red eyes gleam with eerie malevolence from the darkness.

863
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,420
I could just sneak in, probably.

864
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,500
And then we got this pipe.

865
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,580
Alarming green sludge oozes from the drain.

866
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,820
The masonry looks as though it may be from the dark ages.

867
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:08,620
Okay.

868
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,120
What else we got?

869
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,040
Pottsdem.

870
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,840
I'm just gonna enter this house.

871
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,860
The glass is so clear, the reflection makes it difficult to see.

872
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,700
What was that?

873
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:27,540
Did you guys hear that?

874
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:28,760
It sounded like gunshots.

875
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,920
The garage needs a new paint job.

876
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,760
Mr. Potsdam.

877
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,530
Wait, what?

878
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:47,150
A funerary earned is the cabinet's sole occupant.

879
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,790
The man of the house.

880
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,030
Squeezing his meat.

881
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,430
Almost made of leather.

882
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:16,090
Polyester's music is really just...

883
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,790
Mrs. Potts, um...

884
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:26,730
Hello, Steve.

885
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:28,590
Have you flossed today?

886
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:33,430
You look just like my mom, except for the hair.

887
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,970
Oh, Stephanie, yeah, I want to meet Stephanie.

888
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:38,810
Well, Stephanie is grounded, Steve.

889
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:39,170
What?

890
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:39,670
Why?

891
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:41,830
I'm sure I don't know.

892
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:48,130
Mr. Poston has sent her to a room, and in her room she'll stay until Mr. Poston says otherwise.

893
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,330
Probably until the wedding.

894
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:53,530
What if I type mom?

895
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,170
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

896
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:58,070
Okay, never mind.

897
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:00,630
Tell me about this wedding.

898
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:02,650
Well, it's set for three weeks.

899
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:06,910
We're holding it over at Shady Oaks, Mr. Moynihan's funeral parlor.

900
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:08,250
A funeral parlor!

901
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:13,390
Now, I know it's not a very romantic place, but there's nowhere else to hold it.

902
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,390
What is this music?

903
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,170
Everything is overlapping.

904
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:19,530
Uh...

905
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:23,990
Mr. Moynihan runs the Wayward Hotel and the Shady Oaks funeral parlor.

906
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:27,350
It's rumored he has connections with the lodge.

907
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,670
But the order keeps that kind of thing secret so mr.

908
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:56,890
Paxton has tried to get him to put in a good word for his lodge application but so far the lodge we need to know more about the lodge what can you tell me about the lodge yeah just that they're exclusive and secretive if you're curious you want to pick up a lodge application at the post office and take it over to the sergeant at arms isn't that a thought.

909
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:58,890
Forget Mr. Podstum.

910
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:04,730
If you became a member of the order, we could hold the wedding inside the lodge.

911
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:08,230
My, wouldn't that be lovely?

912
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,030
What is going on so far?

913
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,910
You mustn't be too hard on Mr. Podstum, Steve.

914
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:17,290
He's a disappointed man.

915
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,330
This money returns my bank account tomorrow.

916
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:21,390
I could be sure I was dreaming.

917
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:22,330
No!

918
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,890
He has a new application in, though, so keep...

919
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:27,250
Keep your fingers crossed.

920
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:33,330
If he joins the lodge, you and Stephanie can have your wedding in the Chapel of Love.

921
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:36,150
Rather than over at Moynihan's place.

922
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:38,350
The Chapel of Love.

923
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:41,250
Love.

924
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:44,010
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

925
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,030
If I also say the...

926
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:48,470
Give my regards to your parents.

927
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:50,470
The F word to her, will she...

928
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,570
Stephanie's mom.

929
01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:28,530
Stephanie's mom save yeah we're gonna try it most people won't react that's okay oh dear come to see Stephanie have you yes please she's upstairs oh go right on up just remember she's grounded until the wedding so we could see her but okay sorry I didn't catch that okay bye give my regards to your parents ice box the Bushes are preventing it from opening.

930
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:30,290
You can't even use the door?

931
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:32,130
Okay.

932
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:33,230
Exit.

933
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:33,830
Exit.

934
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,370
Exit.

935
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:40,570
The entire kitchen has a minty fresh look and scent!

936
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:44,230
Minty fresh!

937
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:48,570
Me!

938
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,690
We'll talk to him in a second.

939
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:52,910
Let's go talk to our girl.

940
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:55,370
Examine the thing.

941
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:58,690
It's, you know, one of those things.

942
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,590
The closet door won't budge.

943
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:02,950
What's in here?

944
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:08,970
Wait, wait, wait.

945
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,110
Before we talk to her.

946
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,730
Why are we so small?

947
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:16,690
Before we were so huge and now we're so small.

948
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:17,830
What is this music?

949
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:18,990
Is Stephanie and Haley?

950
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,030
I don't know.

951
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:24,490
A thin layer of hair coats virtually every inch of ceramic.

952
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:27,610
Nasty.

953
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:28,810
Operate the toilet.

954
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:29,090
Wait.

955
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:31,950
What's the picture?

956
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:33,350
She's purdy.

957
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,710
What the hell?

958
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:38,470
The picture on the wall is hanging a bit crooked.

959
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:42,390
It's covered with what appears to be toothpaste.

960
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,770
Wow, they don't clean!

961
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,720
Oh my gosh, we're in our girlfriend's room.

962
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,260
This is huge, you guys.

963
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:55,860
This is huge.

964
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,300
Who are you?

965
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,540
What are you doing in my room?

966
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,240
She doesn't know.

967
01:19:03,920 --> 01:20:26,960
so you're the one Steve isn't it she's so cute I mean you don't know me I mean I don't know anyone I don't remember anything how many times do I have to say it just one Stephanie because I can't remember a damn thing either oh really oh God I thought it was just me you're not alone can you tell me what's going on here those people downstairs have locked me in my room they say I'm grounded wedding those people wait amnesia maybe my amnesia isn't total after all you're familiar to me like we've met before in another life you say God maybe we really do the music stop maybe we were together and the same thing happened to both of us an axis something neither of us has bumps on our heads if that's what you're getting at have you been able to remember anything else I mean anything at all well I have had these recurring dreams just fragments really kicking them hearts strange abstract images liquid chrome probably just a dream well have you thought about how to escape harvest oh it came back

968
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,270
What is...

969
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:42,710
I'm examining his figure.

970
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:49,110
My man, look at the Laura Croft booty on this guy.

971
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,050
It's so sharp.

972
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:54,150
The wedding is only three weeks away.

973
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:57,310
Not much time to get to know each other, is it?

974
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:04,270
Uh, suddenly the idea of a wedding doesn't seem so bad.

975
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,190
Wait, am I into her or not?

976
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:29,310
she's like okay hold on he's one two three he's about say like 10 lips high oh that's maybe generous but she's probably like 15.

977
01:21:32,610 --> 01:22:14,550
do you like blondes yeah into it thanks but I wouldn't marry anyone with things you know as they are tall clean yeah well they can't force us to go through with it if it comes down to it we just think it's more less about him being short in just the proportions of everything too many people are determined that we get hitched why potstam wants the meat your father promised him your parents want to force you to settle down mrs potstam wants to have the wedding in the lodge me i just want to escape

978
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:41,040
escape harvest is a prison steve oh yeah don't forget that yeah yeah i think you're right yeah these people are just eccentric but they are of course i'm right i don't think we did the lodge yet everything in harvest seems to revolve around this This order of the Harvest Moon.

979
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,480
They're responsible for this insane fake sale that's coming and for the Harvest Blood Drive too.

980
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,260
When people talk about the lodge, it's always in this hushed, reverent tone.

981
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:51,720
Yeah.

982
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,080
Oh, what's happening?

983
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,700
Mom keeps telling me that women can't join.

984
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,800
But she keeps pressuring me to get you to join.

985
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:00,900
Oh.

986
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:03,500
She's not the only one who wants me to sign on with the lodge.

987
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,300
That's probably the worst thing you could do.

988
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:38,740
a trap i think all of harvest is a trap yeah that's true maybe joining the lodge is the way out look why not explore the town a little i can't get out of here but if i could that's what i do maybe you can figure out what's happening here without going anywhere near the lodge you're really afraid of the lodge aren't you i look at that building all lit up at night and i get scared same cutscene.

989
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,120
I mean, look at the damn thing.

990
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:40,820
Oh.

991
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,940
Seem like a harmless bunch of masons to you.

992
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,760
She's so pretty.

993
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,100
Okay, bye.

994
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,080
Come back and visit me soon.

995
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,000
Okay.

996
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:52,900
Okay.

997
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,500
Let's go talk to her papa.

998
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,180
With the alien music.

999
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:05,960
There he is.

1000
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,280
My future son-in-law.

1001
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,920
And how's he doing today?

1002
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,600
What brings him to the Potsdam House sold.

1003
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:11,780
Huh?

1004
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:13,420
Huh?

1005
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,300
Uh-huh?

1006
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,700
I came over to see...

1007
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,600
Wait, what if I say I've also lost my memory?

1008
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,000
What a card.

1009
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,380
Would I kid about something like that?

1010
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,880
Why won't you believe me?

1011
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:26,300
Well, you always were a kidder, Steve.

1012
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,700
You rather just telephone dust about your lady's shenanigans.

1013
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,880
Isn't that right, Mrs. Potsdam?

1014
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,880
Sure did, Mr. Potsdam.

1015
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,640
You little rascal.

1016
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:36,600
Little rascal.

1017
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,160
Imagination's a swell thing to have in small amounts.

1018
01:24:40,260 --> 01:25:53,500
man needs to keep his feet on the ground especially if he's getting married tell me is your father feeling better is he going back to the slaughterhouse slaughterhouse oh that must be the meat place um amnesia this is sick I'm supposed to marry this Stephanie and I don't even know who she is it's so loud why is there like a breeze in this house but don't go scaring me like that it's so windy in here now look is a commitment you're going to marry my daughter will be one happy family and your dad's going to give me all the meat I want right right oh why is he love meat he has the meat on the wall what's what is the meat made of the meat aliens like why is Stephanie grounded well don't look at me Mrs. Podstam wants Stephanie to study hard for her finals if it was up to me you could go straight upstairs but you know the little woman you'll have to ask her permission to see Stephanie oh well I did sorry Steve the last thing I should have talked to him first my bad and your father before the

1019
01:25:53,500 --> 01:26:12,000
wedding not with the meat at stake you will remind your dad about the meat won't you I think that sound is TV static I think he's watching straight up TV static oh he might be the meat I need to know the of any decent society.

1020
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:15,760
Everyone needs at least three servings of red meat a day.

1021
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,940
And anyone who says otherwise is a commie.

1022
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:24,660
And once you're married to Stephanie, I'll be part of the family too.

1023
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,040
And your father will give me all the meat I want.

1024
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,840
Kind of makes up for not getting into the lodge.

1025
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,540
Oh my god.

1026
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:51,680
I haven't seen my father He's locked in a room Wait, he's locked in a room He's not going to die, is he?

1027
01:26:52,120 --> 01:27:05,700
Like I said, I don't know That woman mom Tends to him herself Well, next time you've seen Be sure to tell him that I said hello And tell him that I'm praying For his speedy recovery

1028
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:14,480
I can't hear you over the The sound of the If I see...

1029
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,400
Greasy waves.

1030
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:16,940
Like ASMR.

1031
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,500
If he dies, then who's going to take over the slaughterhouse?

1032
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,520
Who's going to tend to the meat?

1033
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,700
I guess as a son...

1034
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,440
The meat!

1035
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,140
You take over.

1036
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:28,540
Right?

1037
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,080
I can't hear you.

1038
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:33,940
Slaughterhouse?

1039
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,300
Did I ask?

1040
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:37,560
I can't imagine a better job than working in a slaughterhouse.

1041
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,120
A slaughterhouse?

1042
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,060
I think working in a slaughterhouse might be cool.

1043
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:43,620
Okay.

1044
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,760
Sure, it'd be just dandy.

1045
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,840
And you can't argue with success.

1046
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,760
Everyone in harvest gets their meat from your dad.

1047
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,380
There's a fun scene in the bathroom?

1048
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,740
Me, wait, wait.

1049
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:58,460
Oh, sure.

1050
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,100
Oh, my God.

1051
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,280
Cutting animals open may not be much fun.

1052
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:08,700
Reaching into their bodies and yanking out the bloody guts, intestines dangling and slapping against you.

1053
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:12,560
The smell of death and shit in your nostrils all the time.

1054
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:35,820
those are all definite comms but once you're done your guts have been washed oh my god what was that you left with me scared me my ears I literally jumped okay bye I don't want to talk to you anymore

1055
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,880
something in the bathroom what can I do Oh.

1056
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,400
God, that scared me.

1057
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,040
I think I examined everything in here though.

1058
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:50,900
Oh, medicine cabinet.

1059
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,780
Reeks of various toiletries.

1060
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:58,260
Uh, a window affords a spectacular view of aluminum siding.

1061
01:28:58,620 --> 01:28:59,800
Oh, the aluminum siding!

1062
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,800
Quads of used tissue.

1063
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,160
Ew.

1064
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,400
Fix it?

1065
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:06,620
Oh!

1066
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,360
Oh!

1067
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,100
You just...

1068
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,740
Okay.

1069
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:19,600
Okay.

1070
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,160
The music?

1071
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,620
It's a start?

1072
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:40,330
The music was so like...

1073
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:40,550
Where?

1074
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:41,330
Where?

1075
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:41,970
Where?

1076
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:46,670
None of the music in this game fits the situation.

1077
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,690
It's an awesome...

1078
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:49,550
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1079
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,270
Who... who are you wearing that for?

1080
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:56,090
She's just... she's just wanting to look sexy all by herself?

1081
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:01,670
Yeah, I can't help that the game is stretched.

1082
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:02,410
I'm sorry.

1083
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:06,410
Unfortunately.

1084
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:08,310
It did that on its own.

1085
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:12,450
Oh.

1086
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,370
Let a girl play dress up.

1087
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:16,270
You're so right.

1088
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:17,750
Wow.

1089
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,690
She was like...

1090
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:24,130
Was that a chicken?

1091
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:28,530
It's impossible to prepare anyone for this game.

1092
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,790
I feel...

1093
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:32,750
Wait, is it...

1094
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,870
Oh no, I thought it was night time for a second.

1095
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:36,890
Abandoned house.

1096
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,130
What's here?

1097
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:40,590
Ooh, spooky!

1098
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,290
Are those flies?

1099
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:47,810
The car...

1100
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:50,330
The old car is a perfect nesting ground for wasps.

1101
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:52,290
Oh, wasps.

1102
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:59,950
The rusty gutter is the perfect nesting ground for wasps.

1103
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:04,710
The attic window is a perfect nesting ground for wasps.

1104
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:08,890
The overhang is a perfect nesting ground for wasps.

1105
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,450
It is not the perfect...

1106
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:14,070
Wait, I can go in.

1107
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:15,270
Oh.

1108
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,420
Oh, there's wasps.

1109
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:25,540
Okay, maybe this is the only time the music has been...

1110
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,200
The icebox is sealed shut with wasp nests.

1111
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:40,130
Bees!

1112
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:45,770
The Mint Cafe is a perfect nesting ground for wasps.

1113
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,130
For wisps.

1114
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:53,110
A wasp nest.

1115
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:55,850
A rather colorful picture of a wasp.

1116
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:58,170
What is going on in this game?

1117
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:04,600
Oh, I can't walk anymore.

1118
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,280
Tetsua Crum.

1119
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,820
It's not often that I get visitors.

1120
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:11,860
I am Tetsua Crum.

1121
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,760
call me the wasp woman.

1122
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,080
A pejorative, no doubt.

1123
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,980
Born of fear and a poverty of imagination.

1124
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,620
I don't understand.

1125
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,860
The politics of honey.

1126
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:37,340
The Judeo-Christian rights of sacrifice and conventional taboos against unbridled pleasure are all responsible for the prejudice against wasps.

1127
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:37,640
What?

1128
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:38,640
Wasps?

1129
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,040
Wasps.

1130
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,200
Um, pleasure?

1131
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,660
Yes, a great deal of pleasure.

1132
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:55,560
The wasp is a sensual being, not a laborer, hedonistic instead of industrial.

1133
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,480
Some think them quick to anger.

1134
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,680
In truth, they are easily swayed to ecstasy.

1135
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:11,260
They penetrate your flesh, and the muscular contractions in their thorax as they pump venom

1136
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:24,740
contractions of ejaculation each painful welt an act of love

1137
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:38,370
this lady fuses your personas what are you what is that supposed to mean um regard

1138
01:33:41,460 --> 01:34:22,440
the wasps i'm not sure what to say about i have no comment wasps produce nothing for others but only for themselves wasps spill nests and more wasps nothing more they spread into ease and addicts not to make honey for supermarkets gonna do a great tumbler in six years perpetuating their own agenda growing stealthily i was stung by a lot of wasps the most relentless of insects that's the that's the lodge oh my god oh my god Oh my god!

1139
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:23,780
Even the wasps?

1140
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:29,720
What does this mean for the pain in Metal Gear Solid 3?

1141
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:36,740
When a bee stings, it rips itself apart and dies for its audacity.

1142
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:44,220
This appeals to those raised worshiping a god that demands sacrifice and atonement.

1143
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:48,010
But the wasp is promiscuous.

1144
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:50,160
Promiscuous.

1145
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,440
They are not as sympathetic.

1146
01:34:51,680 --> 01:35:24,320
to the masses because they don't die when they sting yeah they live to sting another day and they take pleasure from it but what if i say be a triviality this super chat is the perfect destined ground for wasps the pain what do i say um i think yeah i think i I'm just going to go.

1147
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:25,340
Bye.

1148
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:31,800
Wow.

1149
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:34,420
That.

1150
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:35,900
Let's.

1151
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,180
Okay.

1152
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,620
Wait a second.

1153
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,880
One second before we talk to Mr. Johnson.

1154
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,500
I want to go back home.

1155
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,760
Because they said that my dad is in a room.

1156
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:51,820
I want to see.

1157
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,220
Oh, the master bedroom.

1158
01:35:53,240 --> 01:36:40,380
maybe here the master bedroom door is firmly locked if I talk to my mom I told you I'm busy Steve why don't you talk to Hank or go next door and visit Stephanie or go get an early start on your new job what's my new job what's my job that's right a job oh your father has everything set up at the meat plant after your honeymoon with Stephanie you'll start out as a butcher in the slaughterhouse just like anybody else don't expect any favors just because you're the boss's son okay don't forget to put the papers out for jimmy you know how he gets that's the true horror my mom telling me to get a job

1159
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:56,380
i part of me wants to go to this to the meat house because i'm so curious now the meat plant But there's also some...

1160
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:59,160
We've been kind of just making our way around town, you know?

1161
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:01,140
Nah, we'll go to the meat.

1162
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,820
Meat plant.

1163
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,340
What is that?

1164
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,360
Oh.

1165
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,180
Red brick building with a horrible stench coming from within.

1166
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,900
Harvest meats, ink.

1167
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:23,030
I don't think it's human.

1168
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,580
I don't want to see this part.

1169
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,840
I actually don't want to though.

1170
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:42,360
I'm okay with most stuff but I don't want to see this.

1171
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:47,780
Uh...

1172
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:55,880
Uh...

1173
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:57,200
Let chat play.

1174
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,380
I know I have to.

1175
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,360
Oh wait, I only just saved up bees.

1176
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,460
I think I don't have to save again.

1177
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:10,860
It's okay.

1178
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:12,780
I don't have to go here yet?

1179
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,780
Okay, we'll come back then.

1180
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:17,800
Let's go.

1181
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:18,880
Let's go to the Johnson.

1182
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,080
Why is he always really upset with...

1183
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,520
Or obsessed with the cat meat?

1184
01:39:23,600 --> 01:40:01,980
Steve how's the husband to be I'm having no memory I guess I'm all right all right holy you should be ecstatic considering what you're getting into if you haven't gotten into it already what does that mean speaking of which I heard Stephanie was grounded her daddy's worried about getting his meat so if I were him I'd more concerned about Stephanie getting some meat right and you are you always were a kid or Steve I'm mr.

1185
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:58,040
Johnson remember glad you stopped by just got finished waxing the Tucker I could use a little relaxation but since Edna's not here i might as well talk to you sure uh oh but who's edna edna fitzpatrick is one of the snootiest women in town i declare there is an i declare that turned me away if i was interested that is oh sure just because she owns dna's she's got all these highfalutin ideas about independence and her with a little girl to raise that child needs a father and Edna well she needs a good hard penis what

1186
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:52,570
makes you so sure she needs a penis you seeing Edna's getting it from someone else like maybe that damn sheriff Dwayne Dwayne he's sheriff every day from noon to one feeding his dad gum pie and i got a feeling he'd like edna for dessert oh sure it's the only diner in town but i'm sure he's got more of his mind than food i think you're projecting mr no not the sheriff dwayne dwayne No!

1187
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:54,990
No!

1188
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:56,510
Anybody but him!

1189
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:00,330
I'll admit DNA's diner does good business.

1190
01:42:01,170 --> 01:42:01,190
Why?

1191
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,910
What is the name DNA's diner?

1192
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:04,530
That's weird.

1193
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:07,370
Can money keep you warm at night?

1194
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:10,870
Can you wrap your thighs around it?

1195
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:16,290
Rigged bloody gases in its back with your painted hollered fingernails?

1196
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:17,770
Edna?

1197
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:19,750
Edna?

1198
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:20,750
Fuck.

1199
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:25,130
So, how's Stephanie?

1200
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:35,240
How does it feel getting out freaked?

1201
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:41,220
I, like, bro is crashing out.

1202
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,660
I was, oh my gosh, octopus.

1203
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,260
I was thinking the same thing.

1204
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,560
It was so like a, oh, hi, Steve.

1205
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,640
Oh, hi, Bark.

1206
01:42:51,220 --> 01:43:31,540
is that speaking of stephanie i still haven't gotten an invitation to the wedding yet i don't have anything to do with that that's okay the chicken getting shot in the background what is happening you could use the back seat of my tucker for the for a pass to the voyage it's plenty big believe you and me did he just ask to come on the honeymoon and i wouldn't look in the back seat guarantee it though if you'd like to come up front and take the wheel a while i wouldn't say nay his eyes are so insane

1207
01:43:39,870 --> 01:44:23,930
painted harlot fingernails this guy's so this is so insane heck of an automobile isn't she the tucker damn shame i have to sit out here and watch over the time but if I didn't those stupid kids might scratch her up playing ball oh can I take a look at it don't see why not but don't touch her okay mighty particular about my Tucker I had the garage remodeled like a fortress so I could lock her up at night and get some sleep I'm sure she's safe enough inside a few months back someone broke into my house trying to get into the the garage.

1208
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:30,990
I had to gripe like hell before the sheriff agreed to start the evening patrols and instigate the curfew.

1209
01:44:31,870 --> 01:44:32,230
Curfew?

1210
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:34,450
I'm gonna steal his car.

1211
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:34,910
Bye now.

1212
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:35,430
Bye.

1213
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:40,630
During the day, Mr. Johnson keeps watch over his precious 48 Tucker.

1214
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:43,130
I can't go inside.

1215
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:44,310
The garage.

1216
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:49,690
Mr. Johnson erected an impenetrable fortress to protect his Tucker during the night.

1217
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:51,270
Okay.

1218
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:56,850
Wow, that guy was Where's the...

1219
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:58,010
I want to go see Edna.

1220
01:44:59,070 --> 01:44:59,510
Oh, wait.

1221
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:00,310
It's here, right?

1222
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:01,950
Oh, there's a TV station.

1223
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:02,990
I think I missed that.

1224
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:04,150
Edna's diner.

1225
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:10,200
I'm curious about here.

1226
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:17,280
A 1955 Frag 100 with a real leather seat.

1227
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,920
Oh, DNA is because the E is out.

1228
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:23,480
I see.

1229
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:27,120
Oh, Steve, what are you doing?

1230
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:58,540
sneaking up on me like that god for a second i thought you were mr johnson not mr johnson please what would you like to order you know me sure and my name's edna fitzpatrick i'm not the one with amnesia then you believe me well you always were a kid or steve i guess i've changed i'm not kidding now steve faking amnesia won't help her face if you don't If you don't want to marry Stephanie,

1231
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,260
then don't.

1232
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,540
But don't play sick for heaven's sake.

1233
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,760
I'd expect that from Karen, not an 18-year-old.

1234
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,840
Karen is the kid down here.

1235
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,940
You've met Karen, my 8-year-old.

1236
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,320
Other than the diner, she's all I have.

1237
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:33,190
Yeah, we're like a really tough 18.

1238
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:39,290
They keep saying we're 18, but I'm like, How many times?

1239
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:44,730
You always wear a kidder window.

1240
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:49,730
There isn't a nicer girl in Harvest than Stephanie's Eve.

1241
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:50,610
Yeah, 18 going on 30.

1242
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:53,250
You should be grateful that she's promised you her hand.

1243
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:55,210
I don't remember that happening, Edna.

1244
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:58,570
Honestly, you men are so childish.

1245
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:04,490
I don't know what it is about marriage that turns even the bravest man into a coward.

1246
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,050
I was going to marry Karen's father.

1247
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:09,750
when he just up and ran out on me one night.

1248
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:10,430
Oh, my God.

1249
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:11,890
I heard that he'd joined the lodge.

1250
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:12,890
The lodge!

1251
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:14,890
But if he did, I never saw him come out again.

1252
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:18,470
Even Sheriff Dwayne wasn't able to find out what happened to him.

1253
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:18,910
No.

1254
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:22,430
Um, I'm really curious about Mr. Johnson.

1255
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:26,530
Mr. Johnson has a liking for me.

1256
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:27,410
Uh...

1257
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:30,290
I call it a crush, but that's too innocent a word.

1258
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:34,130
He's a bitter man with too much time on his hands.

1259
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:37,350
He's never gotten over being rejected by him.

1260
01:47:37,370 --> 01:48:11,330
by the lodge and there's something unwholesome in the way unwholesome I'm always glad when the sheriff comes in every day at noon the lodge the lodge is the repository of all wisdom you should join the order of the harvest moon Steve and soon why for God's sake what is it about me apparently they're rejecting everybody ripens and waits not for the side there's only 50 people here in this town that he used the to rip his own stomach out than to stay his side when the wheat ripens.

1261
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:14,670
The harvest moon wanes and then comes winter.

1262
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:19,270
An empty belly, the body sun's belly, gurgling within or bloody on the ground.

1263
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:23,310
What does it benefit a man if he gains his soul and loses the world?

1264
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:24,970
You hunger.

1265
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:29,590
Feed yourself before it's too late.

1266
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:31,070
Oh.

1267
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:32,770
Edna?

1268
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:34,130
Steve.

1269
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:37,350
What happened?

1270
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:37,730
What happened?

1271
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,750
Were we talking about Boyle?

1272
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:43,310
Or was it Karen?

1273
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:45,410
You seem strange there for a minute.

1274
01:48:46,130 --> 01:48:46,570
I'm sorry.

1275
01:48:47,790 --> 01:48:48,990
I'm under a lot of stress.

1276
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:51,390
Running this diner all alone.

1277
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:56,520
Forgive me.

1278
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,180
Oh.

1279
01:48:58,640 --> 01:48:59,260
Interesting.

1280
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:03,760
Okay.

1281
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:08,400
I'm still waiting on my order.

1282
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:10,240
Postmaster Boyle.

1283
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:15,420
Though I see them together a lot, Boyle and the sheriff never act very friendly towards each other.

1284
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,420
I need the postmaster to give me the application.

1285
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,840
Almost like there's some kind of bond between them besides friendship.

1286
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,160
Though what it might be, I can't imagine.

1287
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,960
Maybe Sheriff Dwayne resents the fact that he's never been able to get into the lodge.

1288
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,980
Though that's not Boyle's fault.

1289
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,080
He just hands out the applications.

1290
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,380
He doesn't decide who gets admitted.

1291
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:37,620
And the sheriff?

1292
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,640
Sheriff Dwayne is such a dear man.

1293
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,460
A dear man.

1294
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:45,260
And I didn't just say that because he's my most regular customer.

1295
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:50,160
Every single day, rain or shine, he comes in here at noon for lunch.

1296
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:52,120
Sits in the same spot, too.

1297
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:56,720
That's at least an hour every day when I can be sure Mr. Johnson won't show up.

1298
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:57,720
Bellow yellow.

1299
01:49:58,140 --> 01:49:58,860
You know, it's funny.

1300
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,220
Dwayne never comes in here with Deputy Rookie.

1301
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:02,340
Yeah, he's a dear man.

1302
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,040
I wouldn't be surprised if he had books.

1303
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:06,440
You know, the owner of the TV station.

1304
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,100
Sometimes he comes in with Postmaster Boy.

1305
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:16,320
but somehow I don't think they're friends is nobody friends TV station mr.

1306
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:37,240
McKnight owns the TV station WHAR he seems to get along with Sheriff Dwayne better than Boyle does okay better than just about anyone to tell the truth I don't see the connection between them but I'll bet you dollars to donuts that it's there anyhow I see you bye stop by anytime Steve thank you Edna mr.

1307
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,320
kid what's your name Karen Sharon.

1308
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:40,380
What are you doing?

1309
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:41,620
Playing.

1310
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:45,460
My mom is working, so I gotta stay out of her hair.

1311
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:46,580
Wanna play?

1312
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,560
Not now, maybe later.

1313
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:49,480
Okay.

1314
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:50,180
Okay.

1315
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:50,860
Bye-bye.

1316
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,020
Bye-bye.

1317
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:53,920
Okay.

1318
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:55,800
Bye-bye.

1319
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:57,160
Bye-bye.

1320
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:04,730
Uh...

1321
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:06,170
Oh, I'm trying to...

1322
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:10,130
Oh, even from the ground you can hear the sonorous buzz of the neon.

1323
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:11,830
I don't know if I said that right.

1324
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:12,710
Okay, let's see if...

1325
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:17,290
Um, the TV, okay, wait, I think the...

1326
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:19,430
Probably we need to go... Oh, let's go to the mortuary.

1327
01:51:19,530 --> 01:51:20,630
This is where we're getting married?

1328
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:23,170
Wait, it's actually quite nice!

1329
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:24,630
Oh, no, that's the symbol.

1330
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:27,610
The hideous symbol stands out like a...

1331
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:27,970
AHH!

1332
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:30,070
Or a spider.

1333
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:36,900
I was thinking it looked...

1334
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:39,650
Um...

1335
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:40,910
Like, uh, what's it called?

1336
01:51:45,990 --> 01:52:09,090
like a oh my gosh like a Pokemon symbol I don't even see the squash spider Steve that's my last name for the record I don't own a TV station are you sure are you sure.

1337
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:12,250
Sideways, see?

1338
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:15,430
The cool symbol, the cool S.

1339
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:17,830
A large translucent window.

1340
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:20,090
Professionally kept landscape.

1341
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:21,430
Let's go in.

1342
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,320
It's quiet.

1343
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:35,060
Schedule of this week's funerary events.

1344
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:36,980
How many people are dying in this town?

1345
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,640
It's population 51.

1346
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,500
Soon to be 50.

1347
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,220
Pair of comfortable looking sofas.

1348
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:45,700
Hmm.

1349
01:52:45,720 --> 01:53:09,820
on today's episode young minto visits a town where nearly everyone she runs into is freakier than she is turns out you can be too freaky i'm not even that freaky you guys you know i do wear the freak phantom title with pride but i definitely know i'm not the freakiest phantom empty coat tree Let's go to the door on the left.

1350
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,400
Oh, that...

1351
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:24,660
The sound effects are...

1352
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:32,870
It sounded like the sound effect from the Zubini's.

1353
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:39,090
The heart, a disembodied organ which was never meant to pump formaldehyde.

1354
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:42,310
Oops, he spilled.

1355
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:43,010
Eww!

1356
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:49,030
It sounds just like a symphony sound effect.

1357
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:51,090
Very nasty looking sink.

1358
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:55,290
On the counter sits a new tube of astroglu.

1359
01:53:56,890 --> 01:53:57,850
Temperature gauge.

1360
01:53:57,870 --> 01:54:00,110
Here I'll turn it down for everybody who gets bothered by this.

1361
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:02,690
The needle lies on 33 degrees Fahrenheit.

1362
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:03,590
Ooh, chilly.

1363
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:08,910
The fans wearing blades barely stir the stench-laden air.

1364
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:11,990
Hermito is tastefully freaky.

1365
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:13,150
Thank you.

1366
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:15,970
Mr. Moynihan.

1367
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:16,690
Stephen.

1368
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:17,550
Who are you?

1369
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:18,390
Abraham Lincoln.

1370
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:19,350
I am Daniel Moynihan.

1371
01:54:20,310 --> 01:54:23,090
Mortician and proprietor of the Wayward Hotel.

1372
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:23,390
Wow.

1373
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:25,390
Most people ask me why I don't remember their names.

1374
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:28,250
Well, you always were a kidder, Steve.

1375
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:35,270
Besides, as one who deals with the dead, I try not to involve myself in the affairs of the living.

1376
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:38,890
Your loss of memories of no concern to me, true or false.

1377
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:43,930
Ironic, considering my recent involvement in a charity event.

1378
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:45,790
Sometimes sounds like someone's flushing a toilet.

1379
01:54:46,050 --> 01:54:50,170
My complaints were central to the scheduling of the upcoming harvest bake sale.

1380
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:54,050
I'm gratified the order of the harvest moon got involved.

1381
01:54:54,710 --> 01:54:57,370
The proceeds will certainly help cover my losses.

1382
01:54:58,830 --> 01:55:01,710
Oh, what the bake sale.

1383
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:07,530
This bake sale is a joint effort of the harvest PTA and the order of the harvest moon.

1384
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:46,490
seeds will be used to set up a fund for transients in other words bonds and societal rejects without families who wander into harvest or uninvited then the order is setting up shelters for the homeless not shelters you see a great number of these hobos die while passing through don't ask me why it's what those people do use your common sense steven they're getting turned into the meat if they were involved in setting up the cannibalism why would i be involved and why would i be sustaining losses

1385
01:55:49,890 --> 01:57:05,290
losses it seems that like some elephants graveyard people of low station come to harvest to die they simply drop penniless and they all need burials god knows it feels like we're in life though the wayward hotel i do more than my fair share so why must i pay for the coffins like in between and the afterlife you know my losses to the dead this is angel beats but bad the bake sale yeah purgatory purgatory effort of the harvest pta and the order of the harvest moon the proceeds will be used to set up a fund for transience in other words angel beats that's what i said rejects without families who wander into harvest uninvited then the order is setting up shelters for the homeless not shelters graves oh wait he already said that part order of the harvest moon as always the order of the harvest moon has taken the lead in addressing our societal ills through their sponsorship of the blood drive and the bake sale the lodge ensures that all our needs are met needs Such as...

1386
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:05,990
Yeah, such as...

1387
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:08,310
Pardon me, there are corpses to prepare.

1388
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:08,990
Oh, excuse me?

1389
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:11,610
And my losses have been substantial of late.

1390
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:18,530
If you're sincerely interested in the order, however, you should stop by the lodge and speak with the sergeant at odds.

1391
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:19,170
I keep trying!

1392
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,790
Why should I be interested, Mr. Moynihan?

1393
01:57:21,630 --> 01:57:27,370
Of all the spots in Harvest, the lodge is the most prominent, literally and figuratively.

1394
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:29,110
They would explain also why, like...

1395
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:30,970
It is the ambition of everyone here to join.

1396
01:57:31,810 --> 01:57:33,890
And join you must to attain wisdom.

1397
01:57:34,010 --> 01:57:35,910
Why Edna's...

1398
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:37,610
If I knew I'd be a member.

1399
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:39,730
Went in and never came back.

1400
01:57:39,730 --> 01:57:42,330
I have the feeling you have what it takes to join the order, Stephen.

1401
01:57:42,730 --> 01:57:43,970
If this is like a purgatory.

1402
01:57:45,550 --> 01:57:50,330
Whether or not you live up to your potential is up to you.

1403
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:54,470
Did I talk about the bake sale?

1404
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:55,250
Uh, we'll just leave.

1405
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:55,650
It's fine.

1406
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:56,210
Oh, whoops.

1407
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:57,550
I don't know what he said, my bad.

1408
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:58,590
Examine the corpse.

1409
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:01,230
The messy remains of some poor soul.

1410
01:58:01,970 --> 01:58:02,490
Okay, boy?

1411
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:07,740
Whoa.

1412
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:12,640
The light from the candelabra gleams unwholesomely pink.

1413
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,800
Why is everything pink?

1414
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:20,200
This game is mocking me.

1415
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:24,620
Like the eyes of a horde of rats balancing on thin wires.

1416
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:28,240
The pews.

1417
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:32,760
Rows and rows of empty wooden pews, caked with the dust of indifference.

1418
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,120
Oh!

1419
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,620
A lectern.

1420
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:44,320
A small lectern for a priest.

1421
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,200
I haven't saved in a bit.

1422
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:46,920
Let's save.

1423
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:51,680
Pink.

1424
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:53,020
Okay.

1425
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:55,820
Examine the window.

1426
01:58:56,020 --> 01:59:03,500
A hauntingly beautiful stained glass window in which a man holds a scythe in one hand and some ethereal power in the other.

1427
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:06,540
A saint kneels before a shepherd.

1428
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:09,840
Jubilently terrified.

1429
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:32,880
image just flipped okay the brass candelabra holds several strange smelling candles wait an empty vessel of the dead oh I was gonna say is there something in the casket and the imprint of a hand buttocks and sliding heels are scraped into the thick dust of the pew

1430
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:49,900
head and butt and sliding heels you say

1431
01:59:56,590 --> 02:00:01,590
How for what reason would they be sliding for?

1432
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:07,930
Why is the head...

1433
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:16,340
Pretty normal stuff, yeah?

1434
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:18,560
Did someone say but?

1435
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:21,060
Let's go to the cemetery.

1436
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:34,140
This place...

1437
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:34,880
Whoa!

1438
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,140
Here lies boxcar Willy.

1439
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:43,680
The air here reeks of fresh soil and manure.

1440
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:48,200
Two years in harvest was too long.

1441
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:49,340
Fear not in death.

1442
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:50,960
Monty Jakes.

1443
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,800
The scripture on the headstone has faded beyond legibility.

1444
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,360
November 27th, 1948.

1445
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:03,120
Another unknown visitor.

1446
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,720
Stop, stop, stop.

1447
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:14,660
It's another resting place amongst the graves.

1448
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:15,920
Okay.

1449
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:17,120
We're walking.

1450
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:18,500
Whoa.

1451
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:21,900
The marble doors have been sealed shut.

1452
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:23,440
There's a big old crypt!

1453
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:25,100
We can blow it up!

1454
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:29,360
Just like in the druids.

1455
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,880
All we gotta do is throw something at it.

1456
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:35,000
The Potsdam family crypt.

1457
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:36,740
Wait, what?

1458
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:37,800
What?

1459
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:40,760
Why do they have such a crazy crypt?

1460
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:44,620
Yeah, the salt!

1461
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:45,080
The salt!

1462
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:47,300
We just gotta throw the salt and it'll explode.

1463
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:49,160
I've learned!

1464
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:49,880
I've learned!

1465
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,020
So far, we've just kind of been wandering around.

1466
02:01:56,140 --> 02:02:01,740
We haven't done, like, anything with the stuff that I have, you know?

1467
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:04,880
Hmm.

1468
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:08,240
Can I go to the cemetery on this side?

1469
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:09,840
Is it the same?

1470
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:12,260
Let's see.

1471
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:15,180
Boxcar Willy?

1472
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:15,840
Wait.

1473
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:17,600
Boxcar Willy.

1474
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:18,260
Okay, never mind.

1475
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:23,940
What is this place?

1476
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,220
A hotel!

1477
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:28,740
Wayward...

1478
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:29,000
In?

1479
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:29,720
Is that what I said?

1480
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,900
There is vacancy.

1481
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:39,420
What the?

1482
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:41,700
How did you get in here?

1483
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:46,720
The door is locked.

1484
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:51,020
Reflections make the lobby seem more spacious than it actually is.

1485
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:54,660
Young man, we really have nothing to say to each other.

1486
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:59,040
I have the feeling your image shall soon adorn my slab.

1487
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:03,080
And I'd rather not know the face of the meat I'm slicing.

1488
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:05,500
Oh, sir, this is a hotel.

1489
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:07,780
Hotel.

1490
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:17,620
As owner of the only hotel in town, I do my best to accommodate any hobo who straggles into town, vacancy is permitted.

1491
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:19,500
Uh...

1492
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:21,940
Were the guys who dropped dead staying at your hotel?

1493
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:23,960
I really don't recall.

1494
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:30,280
We get so many low-life dregs passing through here I can't remember every little death that occurs.

1495
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,280
Oh my god!

1496
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,440
Are there that many?

1497
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,560
As I said, Slice open on a mortician's slab, every corpse looks the same.

1498
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:39,740
For him.

1499
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:41,480
And juicy.

1500
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:45,740
But surely you'd remember if these deaths were an unusual occurrence.

1501
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:49,440
You sound like you're launching some sort of investigation, Stephen.

1502
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:50,320
Stephen.

1503
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,680
That would be most unwise.

1504
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,780
Oh, so he is Stephen.

1505
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:54,660
Okay, bye.

1506
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:01,260
I'd say it's been a pleasure, but I find the company of the living so wearisome.

1507
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:04,340
Radio.

1508
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:08,720
The somewhat ponderous console radio evokes an earlier era.

1509
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:13,020
I can't really do anything in here, I suppose.

1510
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,320
Wait, the ledger?

1511
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:17,940
A ledger of names, the last being Jonathan A.

1512
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:18,900
Reinkliff.

1513
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:20,040
Checked in Monday.

1514
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:22,880
Okay, bye!

1515
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:25,740
See ya!

1516
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:28,220
Alright, on to the next location.

1517
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:28,800
The fire!

1518
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:29,300
Oh no!

1519
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:31,980
Wait, we cannot become a fireman.

1520
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,160
Newspaper building and police station.

1521
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:35,660
Let's see if the sheriff is in town.

1522
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:38,320
Who's that?

1523
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:39,960
The cop ignores you.

1524
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:42,140
Too busy writing a bug report.

1525
02:04:44,800 --> 02:05:42,170
okay this is him it is sheriff Dwayne hello Steve let me introduce myself I'm sheriff Dwayne Dwayne and this here is Loomis pleasure I reckon we haven't met before of course we have but I heard about your alleged amnesia and figured I'd play along I sure hope this is just a prank and not the start of some insanity please keep your nose clean or you'll wind up in jail and that's no place to hold a wedding i'd be gonna go to jail just because i have amnesia it's not my fault dwayne dwayne why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this amnesia bunk i'm telling you the truth why won't anyone believe me is it because i'm a kidder you've always been a kidder steve yeah So everybody keeps telling me.

1526
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:45,980
Boy, you need to stop all this funning and get serious.

1527
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:48,340
You've got a wedding coming up soon.

1528
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:52,420
Heck, you should be thinking about your career and about joining the launch.

1529
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:55,180
This is the perfect reason not about the boy who cried wolf.

1530
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:01,800
And if you start, if you are the boy who cried wolf, everybody will start calling you a kidder.

1531
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:09,660
Amnesia or no, you can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing at Harvest.

1532
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,380
I think you and Stephanie are perfect for each other.

1533
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:17,300
I just hope her father's disappointment doesn't spoil it.

1534
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:18,340
Wait, wait, all he wants is me.

1535
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:19,440
Disappointment?

1536
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:24,160
Mr. Potsdam wants to hold a wedding in the lodge, but he'll never get in.

1537
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,100
It's so weird.

1538
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:29,620
Like all the rest, he's always hanging around the post office the first day of the month.

1539
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:32,140
Waiting for Boyle to bring out that much lodge.

1540
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,160
I don't know if I would recommend.

1541
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:36,100
There's always a long line.

1542
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,820
Never enough applications to go around.

1543
02:06:40,560 --> 02:07:14,520
an application chances are you're right out of luck viewer call to the order and even less accepted allison wonderland meets midsummer they've turned him down so many times unless he does something radical he'll never get in uh crime crime wise nothing much has happened in harvest since the newspaper fire this paper fire oh sure every week or so we get the odd transient dropping you But other than that,

1544
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:16,720
it gets pretty slow around here.

1545
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:20,880
Kiwawa's point-and-click adventure arc incoming?

1546
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:22,140
Please!

1547
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:28,700
Kiwawa, I think this game gets kind of...

1548
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:29,640
Sure.

1549
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:30,480
You remember?

1550
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:33,840
The Sentinel building burned down about six months ago.

1551
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:36,080
That's what I'm telling you, Sheriff.

1552
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:37,980
I don't remember anything.

1553
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,660
Why won't you believe I have amnesia?

1554
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:43,060
Well, you've always been a...

1555
02:07:43,080 --> 02:08:15,640
kidder steve anyway the fireman said the fire was caused by arson i never caught the perp though but we found the gas can that was used yes sir re bob it's in the evidence room he's talks that's classified darn it talk so slow how many times you're gonna have to tell me to keep my mouth shut i wonder sorry boss you've got the gas can in the evidence room did you dust it for prince

1556
02:08:18,840 --> 02:09:11,380
you've been watching too much tv steve heck just a box you can make out all those curvy lines anyhow no it's sitting in there gathering dust oh okay is the day we found it just in case i ever need a spare gas can that case is closed it's not closed you never you never you never solved it what's lumus without him I'd have a hard time keeping the peace or at least taking a lunch break mainly Loomis answers the phone and babysits the office while I'm out though sometimes he likes to go in the back and stain the jail mattress isn't that right Loomis oh now sheriff what you gotta go and say that for Loomis has more than his share of problems I wouldn't invite him to the I wouldn't invite him.

1557
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:14,680
Or if you do, make sure he doesn't catch the garter.

1558
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:16,920
That could be embarrassing.

1559
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:21,500
Oh, I wouldn't do nothing, Dwayne.

1560
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:27,300
But I sure would like a little garter than being around Stephanie's thigh.

1561
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:31,720
Oh, well, that'd be right, special.

1562
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:37,360
I think we need to have, I think we need to make, stop Loomis from speaking.

1563
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:38,580
Bye.

1564
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:40,940
anytime, Steve.

1565
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:41,920
Thank you.

1566
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:43,640
The door is locked.

1567
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:44,760
Wait, is this the evidence room?

1568
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:45,820
The door is locked?

1569
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:47,080
That's the evidence room.

1570
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:47,200
Ah!

1571
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:47,380
Ah!

1572
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,040
Where we store items lifted from crime scenes.

1573
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:50,640
Yes, yes.

1574
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:52,120
It's kept locked at all times.

1575
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:54,740
Okay, we gotta get Mr. Dwayne out.

1576
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:56,380
Make people jump through hoops.

1577
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:02,880
And then we'll probably Loomis won't care if we go into the evidence room.

1578
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:05,940
I think that guy won't care at all.

1579
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,760
Okay, so what's so wrong with fire, man?

1580
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:12,660
I do wonder.

1581
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:14,760
Please excuse the mess.

1582
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:18,220
They've done wonders with the upstairs bedroom.

1583
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:21,260
But this garage defies color coordination.

1584
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:27,040
A fire truck with a lovely shade of pink.

1585
02:10:35,730 --> 02:10:38,150
Please excuse the mess.

1586
02:10:38,830 --> 02:10:38,970
Oh!

1587
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:44,630
Oh!

1588
02:10:45,690 --> 02:11:39,870
the dog up saliva is foaming from his barking chops what's happening here don't bother me i'm sketching oh look what you made me do oh i'm so sorry sparky welcome to the house of flame as we like to call it oh cut it out spots honestly one thing gets barking a good piece of meat is the only way to shut him up there you go spot there you go oh Very important Very important to have The cutscene of The dog licking his lips I'm fire marshal Sparky Head of your fire department Sparky My friend is a fireman I guess this is what he actually does all day When you're waiting for fires What else are you supposed to do?

1589
02:11:41,630 --> 02:11:48,130
I don't think He's not nude He's definitely have Okay Oh no, the alien music is back.

1590
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:55,830
Why are you sketching nude men in the fire department?

1591
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:56,250
Please.

1592
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:59,230
It's not the subject, it's the process.

1593
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:00,990
Don't be such a party group.

1594
02:12:01,950 --> 02:12:03,650
We're talking about art.

1595
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:05,890
I can't hear you over.

1596
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:10,730
Besides, we haven't had a fire and harvest since the newspaper building burned down.

1597
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:15,670
Though I'll admit that the Wasp Woman's place is one big accident waiting to happen.

1598
02:12:15,690 --> 02:12:19,030
This is what some of you guys' fan art of me looks like, you know?

1599
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:22,790
What is happening?

1600
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:24,610
What's going on?

1601
02:12:36,750 --> 02:12:38,190
What's that supposed to mean?

1602
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:40,250
That's just my booty.

1603
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:48,130
They were like, get the dog in as many shots as possible.

1604
02:12:48,230 --> 02:12:49,790
Everybody just wants to see the dog.

1605
02:12:50,730 --> 02:12:51,390
Wasp woman.

1606
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:52,570
Wait, let's go in order.

1607
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:55,810
Art enriches the community, Steve.

1608
02:12:56,430 --> 02:13:02,550
No less than a pulsing fire hose or a fireman beating down a blazing door.

1609
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:04,910
So what if we're drawing a nudes man?

1610
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:06,010
The Lisp's are atrocious.

1611
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:12,690
The only ever draws a nude man or the same nude man over and over in all sorts of provocative positions.

1612
02:13:14,050 --> 02:13:14,210
Provocative?

1613
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:16,290
Procrast, not subject.

1614
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:18,990
Don't be so ghosty, it's beneath you.

1615
02:13:19,150 --> 02:13:20,450
Oh, my bad.

1616
02:13:22,110 --> 02:14:05,210
oh newspaper fire a dreadful affair you wouldn't think that a brick and steel building with a sprinkler system could go up that quickly maybe you were too busy trying to put it out was it arson had to have been actually yeah oh please Dwayne was glad enough to see the thing go up and so was night if you could get into that safe and his wall forget it look Steve as far as I know the fire was an accident let's just leave it at that oh now don't you go moving

1617
02:14:11,770 --> 02:14:18,130
oh he I don't think he did who

1618
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:33,010
just crashed oh my god the wasp woman Some people think all we do is sit around, sketching fetching examples of manhood for our own amusement.

1619
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:35,730
Nothing could be farther from the truth.

1620
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:41,730
Why, just the other day we sighted Ted threw a crumb for firecoat violations.

1621
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:46,970
All the dried-out paper wasp nests clustered around our wooden house.

1622
02:14:47,410 --> 02:14:50,690
Why, it's a Kenlog just waiting for the right faggot.

1623
02:14:51,610 --> 02:14:56,250
Believe me, none of us wants to see another fiasco like the Sentinel fire.

1624
02:14:56,270 --> 02:15:09,310
but what's her deal why does she like the wasps okay we asked about hey bye oh male model I could talk to him I don't converse on the job Steve

1625
02:15:21,880 --> 02:16:04,720
oh I didn't get to ask about spots hold on can't talk now Steve I'm inspired no no spots the dog is that the dog right spots wait spot the pedantic watchdog but like the rest of us he has one awful vice none of us can resist why do they keep showing me the booty oh okay that's uh goodbye i'm examining the dog did i talk to this guy stop it you're messing me up oh yeah i forgot i did this is such a nice firehouse A painting?

1626
02:16:05,580 --> 02:16:07,120
Phallic-like structures.

1627
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,940
Standing all in a row.

1628
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,700
The lights are too high up to reach.

1629
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:14,800
Okay.

1630
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,220
I don't understand the alien.

1631
02:16:24,030 --> 02:16:25,070
What's happening?

1632
02:16:26,830 --> 02:16:28,050
Okay, the newspaper building.

1633
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:29,030
Is it still like...

1634
02:16:29,030 --> 02:16:30,530
I was going to say, is it still like...

1635
02:16:30,530 --> 02:16:32,110
Wow, it really burnt down.

1636
02:16:33,310 --> 02:16:35,130
What's left of the newspaper building after...

1637
02:16:35,150 --> 02:16:36,030
an extreme fire.

1638
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:38,370
The alien's here too.

1639
02:16:39,370 --> 02:16:42,930
At least the plumbing held up.

1640
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:50,560
The shovel.

1641
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,800
Shovel is sticking out of the building's ashes.

1642
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:55,420
Mysterious.

1643
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:56,520
Hmm.

1644
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,260
Mysterious.

1645
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:03,220
Three fire hydrants and the building still burned down?

1646
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:05,080
Miss.

1647
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:06,360
Can I grab it?

1648
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:07,540
Oh, I can!

1649
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:08,720
Oh, I can!

1650
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:14,400
What's left of the newspaper building after an extreme fire?

1651
02:17:15,980 --> 02:17:16,620
Oh, there it is.

1652
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:19,260
Bake.

1653
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:23,080
A supplier for the harvest bake sale.

1654
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:29,220
A postal worker's button, and it looks like it was ripped from the cloth.

1655
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:32,480
Now we're getting somewhere.

1656
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,340
Nice, nice, nice.

1657
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:39,760
Sometimes because I can examine.

1658
02:17:39,780 --> 02:18:11,360

And what's your name, Hombre?

02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:48,200
Hombre?

1663
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:50,280
Steve's a swell name.

1664
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:51,980
My dog's name is Steve.

1665
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:53,280
How'd they write that right?

1666
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:54,960
Would you like my autograph, Steve?

1667
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:55,460
What?

1668
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:03,920
Uh...

1669
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:05,080
Yeah.

1670
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:07,360
Here you go then.

1671
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:08,520
Hombre.

1672
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:09,860
TV violence.

1673
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:10,500
Violence?

1674
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:11,880
What about it?

1675
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:16,460
I love all the blood and gore on you.

1676
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:22,140
This is the show that our alleged little brother was watching.

1677
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:24,140
Children, watch your show.

1678
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:26,360
Don't you think this violence is bad for them?

1679
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:28,900
I love all the blood it got.

1680
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:31,980
What red-blooded American doesn't?

1681
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:35,460
Nothing like an exploding head to get the blood pumping.

1682
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:36,940
Literally that is.

1683
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:41,000
Even so, do you think society pays a heavy price for the violence in the media?

1684
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:43,600
Of course they pay a heavy price.

1685
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:45,200
Just look at the net profits.

1686
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:48,240
They'll line up around the block to see a good slaughter.

1687
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:51,820
Now, excuse me, we're going back on the air.

1688
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:53,240
Wait, is someone going to actually die?

1689
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:54,920
You think?

1690
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:57,560
A corny Western backdrop.

1691
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:01,300
Complete with the cardboard teepee.

1692
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:04,680
Aw, no one is operating the cameras.

1693
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:08,260
Pew!

1694
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:11,780
Wait, can we watch?

1695
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:17,440
Either the show isn't compelling or no one wanted to be taken out by friendly fire.

1696
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:20,820
I think we can go this way.

1697
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:25,220
Oh!

1698
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:27,900
Mr. McKnight!

1699
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:30,340
Very poor reception.

1700
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:32,760
Strange since the broadcast originates from here.

1701
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:33,960
Hello!

1702
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:34,680
Hey, Sport.

1703
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,280
This is a private office.

1704
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:37,400
Yeah, I know.

1705
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:39,280
Mr. McKnight.

1706
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:41,320
I like how you can still hear the alien music.

1707
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:42,860
They really just snuck it in there.

1708
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:45,840
I've lost my memory.

1709
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:46,740
That's news.

1710
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:47,180
War.

1711
02:20:47,340 --> 02:21:43,500
the hell it is you always were a kidder steve how does everybody any real news to tell me actually i was just wanting to know more about the tv i can't hear you over the everything w-h-a-r is the only television station in harvest since the old sentinel went under what with the newspaper building burning down and all war has changed nobody competes with us yeah that's a strange thing to say kidder been well and always steve you've what an odd coincidence hey now sport that's an irresponsible allegation I had nothing to do with that fire just because WHAR may have benefited from it and I danced on the ashes a little doesn't mean I torched a little you can ask Sheriff Dwayne you have any doubts you seem awfully touchy on the subject sport I'm touchy when people try to muscle their way into my business I'd appreciate it if you leave my office.

1712
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:45,280
And don't come back.

1713
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:45,940
Uh-huh.

1714
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:46,700
Uh-huh.

1715
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:49,560
Cubicles.

1716
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,200
An assortment of empty cubicles.

1717
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:55,520
Either McKnight loves to recall his salad days as an insurance salesman.

1718
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:58,420
Or he can't keep his employees happy.

1719
02:21:59,980 --> 02:22:04,260
A picture of a gorgeous model signed with Kiss My Pineapple.

1720
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:05,060
What?

1721
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:06,120
What?

1722
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:09,000
I kind of want some fruit.

1723
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:13,720
Wait.

1724
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:16,120
So people don't die here?

1725
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,760
Silver Tucker.

1726
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:19,200
Oh, Tucker.

1727
02:22:25,450 --> 02:22:26,250
Uh, okay.

1728
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:28,670
The Memorial School.

1729
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:30,650
I think I...

1730
02:22:30,650 --> 02:22:31,370
Wait, did I save?

1731
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:33,470
Oh, yeah, I did.

1732
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:34,390
Because I did button.

1733
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:35,590
That's right.

1734
02:22:37,630 --> 02:22:39,190
We're going back to school.

1735
02:22:40,730 --> 02:22:41,350
Bake sale.

1736
02:22:41,510 --> 02:22:41,830
Oh, yeah.

1737
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:43,010
Principal Harold.

1738
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:46,150
Steve, good of you to drop by, big guy.

1739
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:46,810
Big guy.

1740
02:22:46,990 --> 02:22:48,290
I haven't seen you since graduation.

1741
02:22:48,650 --> 02:23:30,230
a lot of changes i hear you could say that we've only seen one good good that's a nice part of my job turning fine young men and women out into the world and then watching them prosper of course i was able to reach more people at the old sentinel god bless her but then again i never got to see the results of my work up close before who are you who are you you know very well i'm mr herald the principle of gain memorial Steve I've heard about this amnesia nonsense I had hopes you'd be in the lodge by now fine young fellow like yourself but now I think maybe you need a little more quality time

1742
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:47,840
what did he mean by that quality time what did he mean by that I'm scared this game scares me this game It was real horror.

1743
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:49,520
Boy, I sure missed the old newspaper.

1744
02:23:50,180 --> 02:23:52,820
The sheriff never did investigate that fire properly.

1745
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:55,780
Call it a newspaper man's instinct.

1746
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:59,740
Though I can't imagine why Sheriff Dwayne would cover up anything.

1747
02:24:01,220 --> 02:24:07,100
I mean, the only ones who stood to profit from the newspaper going out of business was the owner of the TV station.

1748
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:10,840
And Mr. Magnite had an airtight alibi.

1749
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:14,100
Didn't they say Mr. Magnite and the post office guy?

1750
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:17,000
I never would have wound up as principal of...

1751
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:19,040
Like, you gotta get out of here, me too!

1752
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:23,520
The creepy children in the background.

1753
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:24,940
Keen Memorial.

1754
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:28,500
Sounds like a cemetery or a hospital, not a school.

1755
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:31,860
This institution was named for a great man.

1756
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,160
Whose first name, excuse me.

1757
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:38,520
He epitomized the great potential within us all, big guy.

1758
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:39,320
Big guy.

1759
02:24:39,400 --> 02:24:42,020
I hear there's an honorary plaque commemorating him.

1760
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:43,780
Within the lodge.

1761
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:44,960
So we gotta get...

1762
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:46,480
The lodge.

1763
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:50,280
It's not Ed, is it?

1764
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:56,950
That would be insane.

1765
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:01,910
Stop calling me Big Guy.

1766
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:08,810
The greatest gift I can bestow upon you as your former principal is a word of advice.

1767
02:25:10,230 --> 02:25:13,210
Join the order of the Harvest Moon at any cost.

1768
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:14,030
Big Guy.

1769
02:25:14,190 --> 02:25:18,490
Within the lodge lies your future and without...

1770
02:25:18,870 --> 02:26:02,490
dust dust yeah um big guy why do you keep calling me big guy a sign of respect lad as principal my station is higher than yours now but you never know what the future holds so you should always hedge your bets oh wait that's kind of cute to your inferior oh wait you never know who will come to power or who even now wheels it behind the scenes for all i know you might already be a member yeah we are a little bit wide it's not my fault i'd be all that much better off having shown you respect and spent some quality time with you i keep saying it like that

1771
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:43,060
you were oh you always were a big guy you kidder you surprised that even the big the guy has been awarded the title big guy wait but i kind of i kind of like it you get you call everyone a big guy because you're just like you know in the future you could be the big guy and i'm i'm respecting you that you i believe that you have big things coming and so you call him a big guy it's kind of cute wait that's kind of cute try calling us that hey big guy

1772
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:55,000
i don't like it never mind i i I erased my opinion.

1773
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,160
What's the quality time?

1774
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:01,440
What do you mean, quality time?

1775
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:05,680
Some, like Miss Whaley, favor stern discipline.

1776
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:09,680
Corporal punishment as a means of socialization.

1777
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:11,280
Socialization.

1778
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:15,280
I temper discipline with love.

1779
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:20,080
Quality time can be such a warm, sharing experience.

1780
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:31,960
After just a few sessions, You'd stop this amnesia nonsense and become a productive member of society and a fit candidate for the lodge.

1781
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:36,590
Okay.

1782
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:38,250
Goodbye.

1783
02:27:38,910 --> 02:27:40,270
Drop in again soon.

1784
02:27:41,550 --> 02:27:47,770
Adult education is a wonderful thing, as is adult quality time.

1785
02:27:47,950 --> 02:27:50,770
Oh my god, the way he says it.

1786
02:27:51,090 --> 02:27:53,010
Nobody in this town is normal.

1787
02:27:57,070 --> 02:28:00,190
Where did they find the voice actors for this game?

1788
02:28:00,350 --> 02:28:00,990
It's insane.

1789
02:28:02,630 --> 02:28:02,990
Oh, wait, sorry.

1790
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:03,730
I was just...

1791
02:28:03,730 --> 02:28:04,590
The door is locked.

1792
02:28:05,130 --> 02:28:09,690
The lockers are riddled with inexplicable stains and dents.

1793
02:28:11,290 --> 02:28:12,430
But there was something here.

1794
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:13,430
Let's go there.

1795
02:28:14,530 --> 02:28:14,990
Come on.

1796
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:17,070
Wait, there are children here.

1797
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:18,150
Oh, my gosh.

1798
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:19,590
Miss Whaley.

1799
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:22,430
A rough sketch of the lodge.

1800
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:24,890
The children look stunning.

1801
02:28:24,910 --> 02:28:53,110
and zombified yeah I would be stunned and zombified too if I lived in this hell scape of a town the music even the paper cutouts look stunned and zombified I can't get over how he keeps reading it as koala tea time a

1802
02:28:57,070 --> 02:29:01,330
projector engineered to sound good when played underwater?

1803
02:29:02,890 --> 02:29:04,870
Mint, we might need an actual grown-up.

1804
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:05,610
Yeah, I know.

1805
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,730
This place is scary.

1806
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:08,990
My goodness, class, this is Stevens.

1807
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:11,710
He used to be a student here at Geen Memorial.

1808
02:29:12,050 --> 02:29:13,190
Say hello, class.

1809
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:14,910
They're reticent.

1810
02:29:15,250 --> 02:29:17,750
The educator's greatest problem today is the apathy of the students.

1811
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:18,970
I can't hear you over the music.

1812
02:29:19,230 --> 02:29:21,210
What's wrong with their heads?

1813
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:23,830
I can tell you in one word, Stevens.

1814
02:29:24,390 --> 02:29:24,870
Discipline.

1815
02:29:25,450 --> 02:29:27,590
Thank goodness you weren't a sulky bear.

1816
02:29:29,210 --> 02:30:02,030
smiley bear then you remember me not as such so many pupils Steven they come and they go but I can always spot those who were nice boys you can tell from the forehead the lows right class thank you so much I'm glad you stopped by Steven would you care to say a few words to the class about civic responsibility not really I was just passing through oh but you must Steven a positive role model might be just the thing to inspire these little monsters.

1817
02:30:03,010 --> 02:30:04,730
Steven, have you any questions for me?

1818
02:30:05,010 --> 02:30:06,670
Or shall I continue with class?

1819
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:09,750
Uh, sure.

1820
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:10,350
Sure.

1821
02:30:10,510 --> 02:30:11,290
Yeah, I have some questions.

1822
02:30:11,770 --> 02:30:12,670
Ask away then.

1823
02:30:13,410 --> 02:30:15,190
Yes, pause music?

1824
02:30:15,990 --> 02:30:17,530
Wait, actually, I want to say...

1825
02:30:17,530 --> 02:30:19,310
Stop by anytime, Steven.

1826
02:30:20,130 --> 02:30:22,230
Also, actually, this music is...

1827
02:30:24,370 --> 02:30:25,730
Is this the same classroom?

1828
02:30:26,990 --> 02:30:27,610
Okay, yeah.

1829
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:37,460
Save.

1830
02:30:40,300 --> 02:30:41,580
Beautiful silence, I know.

1831
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:44,320
We'll come, we'll come back.

1832
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:48,300
Where were you?

1833
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:51,420
Wow, what a school.

1834
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,480
We gotta find a way into the lodge.

1835
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:58,280
Now I still don't want to go to the meat plant because...

1836
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:00,260
I don't want to go.

1837
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:03,960
But the missile base, we went and then I didn't talk to anybody.

1838
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:05,280
Or I talked to this guy and then I left.

1839
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:06,960
Who goes there?

1840
02:31:07,420 --> 02:31:08,060
It's just me.

1841
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:08,860
Steve.

1842
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:09,700
Just me.

1843
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:10,200
Steve.

1844
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:11,960
Did the llamas send you?

1845
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:13,080
Lamas?

1846
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:15,860
Uh, of course they did.

1847
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:17,120
I knew it.

1848
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:19,040
They won't leave me alone.

1849
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:21,360
Them in the Kukaburos.

1850
02:31:22,060 --> 02:31:22,500
Nine!

1851
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:23,480
Nine!

1852
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:29,100
Okay,

1853
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:35,050
the llamas are not good.

1854
02:31:35,290 --> 02:31:36,670
Wait, I think we just...

1855
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:40,510
I think we...

1856
02:31:40,530 --> 02:31:43,990

02:31:52,530 --> 02:31:56,610

02:32:20,050 --> 02:32:21,610
Uh, where's the...

1860
02:32:22,750 --> 02:32:24,490
It's like not letting me exit.

1861
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:26,790
Wait.

1862
02:32:27,430 --> 02:32:28,110
Oh, here it is.

1863
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:30,310
Oh my gosh, it's pixel perfect.

1864
02:32:30,950 --> 02:32:32,410
Okay, let's go back.

1865
02:32:33,830 --> 02:32:35,170
Why does this place exist?

1866
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:35,610
Who goes there?

1867
02:32:36,030 --> 02:32:36,770
It's just me.

1868
02:32:37,190 --> 02:32:37,570
Steve!

1869
02:32:37,750 --> 02:32:38,010
Steve!

1870
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:38,590
What do you want?

1871
02:32:39,390 --> 02:32:40,590
Did the llamas send you?

1872
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:43,430
No, the llamas fear me.

1873
02:32:43,450 --> 02:32:43,910
That's good.

1874
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:46,010
Someone has to keep them in check.

1875
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:46,250
Check.

1876
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:48,590
I'm glad you stopped by again.

1877
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:51,430
I want you to infiltrate those firemen, mister.

1878
02:32:51,730 --> 02:32:52,150
Oh, okay.

1879
02:32:52,190 --> 02:32:54,110
There's a lot of art going on over there.

1880
02:32:54,910 --> 02:32:57,650
I want to make sure they haven't turned into Kami bastards.

1881
02:32:57,690 --> 02:32:58,910
Is that what the art is?

1882
02:32:59,430 --> 02:33:02,790
And don't come back unless you've got information for me.

1883
02:33:04,010 --> 02:33:04,190
Oh.

1884
02:33:05,150 --> 02:33:05,710
Bye.

1885
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:08,390
Remember duck and cover?

1886
02:33:08,810 --> 02:33:10,070
Remember the alamo.

1887
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:13,030
These are some, like, hefty...

1888
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:15,970
This base is well stocked with missiles.

1889
02:33:16,030 --> 02:33:23,850
like these are some really big missiles i think you would blow a hole to the other side of the earth

1890
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:48,760
we don't like that sissy art stuff what's this looks like mr pastorelli forgot to point out the paper for jimmy or put out the paper oh my gosh jimmy is is breaking holes into people's houses i prefer vtubers that don't Don't start nuclear war.

1891
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,280
I'm not!

1892
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:50,120
I'm not!

1893
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:53,060
No!

1894
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:54,420
It's not me!

1895
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:55,460
It's not me!

1896
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:00,040
Yeah, we're in the 50s.

1897
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:06,200
Somewhere, during this time, somewhere Peace Walker is happening.

1898
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:08,100
Sorry, son.

1899
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:09,040
No time to talk.

1900
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:13,640
Neither rain nor sleep nor snow nor hell shall keep the mail from its appointed rounds.

1901
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:15,680
I thought he was gonna rhyme.

1902
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:17,160
Um, I have your button, mister.

1903
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:18,660
What's that you say?

1904
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:21,300
Oh, yes, my button.

1905
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:26,160
It's been missing for months now.

1906
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:30,480
I keep meaning to get another, but, well, the button's very distinctive.

1907
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:35,760
I'd have to file an S-411 with Washington to get another, and I just don't need the extra paperwork.

1908
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:38,260
Sure wish I could find it.

1909
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:46,130
Next time you post, don't forget the zip code!

1910
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,890
My button!

1911
02:34:53,970 --> 02:34:55,310
Where did you find it?

1912
02:34:55,850 --> 02:34:56,590
Funny thing, that.

1913
02:34:56,750 --> 02:34:57,090
Yeah.

1914
02:34:57,190 --> 02:34:58,190
I found it in the ashes.

1915
02:34:58,930 --> 02:35:00,310
At the newspaper building.

1916
02:35:00,710 --> 02:35:00,750
Yeah.

1917
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:01,770
What are you implying?

1918
02:35:02,210 --> 02:35:03,910
That I had something to do with setting the fire?

1919
02:35:03,930 --> 02:35:05,450
His face is so scrunched up.

1920
02:35:05,950 --> 02:35:08,910
Why a hundred people must have visited that site since the fire?

1921
02:35:11,150 --> 02:35:13,810
But none of them had buttons like this.

1922
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:16,530
You just try showing that button to Sheriff Dwayne, son.

1923
02:35:16,890 --> 02:35:18,550
He'll laugh you right out of his office.

1924
02:35:21,150 --> 02:35:21,630
Okay.

1925
02:35:22,090 --> 02:35:23,470
Wait, maybe I could try again.

1926
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:59,410
my button why I lost funny thing what do you let's see you we both know you set that fire and what if I did I guess I'd be pretty grateful to anyone who could help get me off the hook how you seem like a capable lad hypothetically let's say there was a gas can sitting in the evidence room at the sheriff's office a gas can which might have some incriminating prints on it uh-huh Someone might be very grateful for the return of that gas can.

1927
02:35:59,970 --> 02:36:05,290
Say, grateful enough to provide whoever returned it with a lodge application.

1928
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:09,990
Oh, and Steve, you'll keep this to yourself.

1929
02:36:10,850 --> 02:36:13,150
Oh, ooh.

1930
02:36:14,570 --> 02:36:18,650
The boss's other son, Revolver Ocelot's brother, Kidder Steve.

1931
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:20,990
Look at his idle animation.

1932
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:24,790
Okay, let's leave.

1933
02:36:25,970 --> 02:36:26,850
Let's leave.

1934
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:30,070
I don't think it was a threat.

1935
02:36:30,250 --> 02:36:34,050
I think it was a bit of a trade, rather.

1936
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:34,750
You know?

1937
02:36:34,930 --> 02:36:36,270
They're like, come...

1938
02:36:36,270 --> 02:36:37,770
They're like, get that evidence.

1939
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:38,850
Wait.

1940
02:36:39,230 --> 02:36:40,750
We know that...

1941
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:41,270
What's his name?

1942
02:36:42,110 --> 02:36:42,550
It's...

1943
02:36:43,290 --> 02:36:45,830
At noon here at the diner.

1944
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:48,190

Oh, well gosh darn, she's pretty.

I hound like a hound dog.

1963
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:47,860
The broom going up and down.

1964
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:50,880
Flashing straw and blood, blood and straw.

1965
02:39:50,980 --> 02:39:51,340
Blood?

1966
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:58,420

02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:39,200
Oh, thank you, Steve.

1987
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:40,820
That's the real deal.

1988
02:42:41,240 --> 02:42:42,540
Excuse me, get home.

1989
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:49,300
I gotta go check the jail for clean tiles.

1990
02:42:49,660 --> 02:42:50,580
Hey, get out of here.

1991
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:56,280
He walks...

1992
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:57,780
So fast, thank goodness.

1993
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:00,180
Okay, examine now, let's see.

1994
02:43:00,460 --> 02:43:28,600
Examine the drawer, drawer is unlocked, open it up, grab the keys, key to the evidence room, yippee, what's the note, a barely legible note, checkbook, a sheriff's way's checkbook, let me in, okay cool, yay, into the evidence, oh, uh, evidence room, to the evidence room,

1995
02:43:28,860 --> 02:43:29,900
yay!

1996
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:34,480
I can pick those up too, can I?

1997
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:36,760
What is going on in here?

1998
02:43:37,380 --> 02:43:37,440
Oh!

1999
02:43:38,580 --> 02:43:39,540
Hello, Steve.

2000
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:40,860
Where's Loomis?

2001
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:43,580
Uh-oh.

2002
02:43:45,420 --> 02:43:47,300
Oh, that's good.

2003
02:43:49,140 --> 02:43:50,940
Loomis, stab you!

2004
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:52,680
Wait, no!

2005
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,440
No!

2006
02:43:53,440 --> 02:43:53,760
No!

2007
02:43:54,260 --> 02:43:54,480
No!

2008
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:57,340
Uh, no!

2009
02:43:58,180 --> 02:43:59,600
Setting up the mattress again!

2010
02:44:07,790 --> 02:44:09,490
Wait, did I just ruin my...

2011
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:11,250
Okay, good.

2012
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:15,110
Pick it up.

2013
02:44:15,210 --> 02:44:15,850
Oh, there we go.

2014
02:44:16,230 --> 02:44:16,690
Pick up the note.

2015
02:44:16,830 --> 02:44:17,690
Oh, thank you so much.

2016
02:44:17,790 --> 02:44:18,650
I totally missed that.

2017
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:20,710
Thank you.

2018
02:44:20,850 --> 02:44:21,050
Thank you.

2019
02:44:21,230 --> 02:44:21,610
Let's see.

2020
02:44:23,370 --> 02:44:25,030
Right click to view the checkbook.

2021
02:44:25,670 --> 02:44:29,750
Wait, there could be some incriminating things in here.

2022
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:31,370
Deposit boil.

2023
02:44:31,550 --> 02:44:32,170
Deposit boil.

2024
02:44:32,390 --> 02:44:32,850
Deposit boil.

2025
02:44:33,130 --> 02:44:33,270
Deposit boil.

2026
02:44:33,650 --> 02:44:34,230
Deposit war.

2027
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:37,750
Does that say $15,000?

2028
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:41,710
Sounds like someone got paid off.

2029
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:46,610
Tulips ammunition.

2030
02:44:50,410 --> 02:44:50,990
Ah!

2031
02:44:53,230 --> 02:44:55,430
It's a lot of dollars.

2032
02:44:58,250 --> 02:45:16,900
Sheriff, if you think I'm going to keep paging, this forever you are crazy there are limits boil oh paying this forever who was boil again

2033
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:42,500
this one looks like one of luma's late relatives this prop helps the sheriff meet his parking tickets quota there are 50 people 50 50 five zero 50 people that live in this town and you're You have quotas?

2034
02:45:46,440 --> 02:45:49,940
One of the developers had to have to experience something like that in their life.

2035
02:45:50,180 --> 02:45:53,340
Seems too specific by getting slapped with a rolled up paper.

2036
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:54,440
I don't know.

2037
02:45:55,220 --> 02:45:57,780
Not surprisingly, Loomis has tainted this evidence.

2038
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:01,880
From the smell of it, you wouldn't want to open this refrigerator.

2039
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:07,320
Real old-fashioned dartboard riddled with holes and crimson smears.

2040
02:46:08,220 --> 02:46:09,260
What's the Santa hat?

2041
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:12,540
A vital clue in the mysterious, jolly fat man murder spree.

2042
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:41,470
read lawn dart this makes sense they're illegal what's a lawn dart a pair of bloody sneakers he did not like green eggs and ham so they killed him what the hell an insta shot camera just point and click oh it's a checky camera this bathroom this bathroom kit is missing its razor

2043
02:46:44,910 --> 02:47:14,850
saw normal cap too small to fit a normal sized head oh the gas can okay oh no put it in my inventory dummy a Volkswagen engine sits rusted up to the core oh that's a plane I thought it was a gun a well-built 148th scale B 17 model the beer can is empty except for tar sediment pair of binoculars without lenses.

2044
02:47:17,470 --> 02:47:18,730
Cabinets are empty.

2045
02:47:19,530 --> 02:47:20,330
A padlock.

2046
02:47:21,030 --> 02:47:22,450
Slightly tarnished finish.

2047
02:47:23,330 --> 02:47:23,570
Toast!

2048
02:47:25,830 --> 02:47:28,530
That most improbable of all murder weapons.

2049
02:47:29,530 --> 02:47:29,990
Toast.

2050
02:47:32,610 --> 02:47:35,010
Lawn darts were a toy game you could buy back in the day.

2051
02:47:35,110 --> 02:47:38,370
You threw them up in the air and they had a metal spike that landed in the lawn.

2052
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:40,570
Ban because they're obviously dangerous.

2053
02:47:41,230 --> 02:47:41,230
Oh!

2054
02:47:43,170 --> 02:47:43,650
What?

2055
02:47:45,050 --> 02:47:46,290
That's kind of insane.

2056
02:47:46,870 --> 02:47:50,150
Clearly an impertinent little vine...

2057
02:47:50,150 --> 02:47:50,630
What is...

2058
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:52,090
I clicked on a bottle.

2059
02:47:53,090 --> 02:47:54,710
Big nose and woody finish.

2060
02:47:55,470 --> 02:47:55,610
Hmm?

2061
02:47:56,810 --> 02:47:57,010
Okay.

2062
02:47:57,510 --> 02:47:57,970
We got it.

2063
02:47:58,010 --> 02:47:58,450
We can go.

2064
02:48:03,570 --> 02:48:03,930
Alright.

2065
02:48:04,410 --> 02:48:04,750
Alright.

2066
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:05,110
Alright.

2067
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:05,570
Oh.

2068
02:48:06,010 --> 02:48:06,690
No, no, no, no.

2069
02:48:07,070 --> 02:48:07,290
Okay.

2070
02:48:07,410 --> 02:48:07,650
Cancel.

2071
02:48:07,770 --> 02:48:07,950
Cancel.

2072
02:48:08,510 --> 02:48:08,890
Not load.

2073
02:48:08,990 --> 02:48:09,350
Not load.

2074
02:48:09,690 --> 02:48:09,890
Save.

2075
02:48:10,950 --> 02:48:11,290
Not load.

2076
02:48:14,530 --> 02:48:15,810
Grab the sneakers.

2077
02:48:16,250 --> 02:48:16,650
Oh.

2078
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:21,460
I forgot.

2079
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:23,020
Where does that kid live?

2080
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:25,840
But they're bloody.

2081
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:27,740
Well, that didn't work.

2082
02:48:29,220 --> 02:48:30,500
Can I pick up anything else?

2083
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:34,920
Oh, I can pick up the camera.

2084
02:48:36,200 --> 02:48:38,520
I'm just stealing all this evidence.

2085
02:48:42,820 --> 02:48:44,260
Yeah, it's mine.

2086
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:45,000
Yoink.

2087
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:45,820
Yoink.

2088
02:48:46,980 --> 02:48:47,480
Yoink.

2089
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:49,940
Okay, now we can leave.

2090
02:48:53,850 --> 02:48:54,370
All right.

2091
02:48:54,970 --> 02:48:55,750
Save as

2092
02:48:59,810 --> 02:49:00,210
larceny.

2093
02:49:00,390 --> 02:49:03,750
Actually, it has to be like a really big theft to be larceny.

2094
02:49:03,850 --> 02:49:06,250
We'll just say petty theft.

2095
02:49:09,270 --> 02:49:10,070
Hours now.

2096
02:49:10,190 --> 02:49:10,950
Yeah, exactly.

2097
02:49:14,090 --> 02:49:16,410
Oh, Phil, thanks for the toast.

2098
02:49:19,150 --> 02:49:21,070
I wonder what we use the camera for?

2099
02:49:22,030 --> 02:49:23,670
We've been to the barbershop, we've been to the post office.

2100
02:49:25,110 --> 02:49:26,670
Did we go to the general store?

2101
02:49:27,950 --> 02:49:30,270
I don't think we'd... Oh, yes I did!

2102
02:49:30,370 --> 02:49:31,430
That's where I got the magazine.

2103
02:49:31,890 --> 02:49:32,350
Just kidding.

2104
02:49:35,730 --> 02:49:36,710
Yes, yes, yes.

2105
02:49:38,230 --> 02:49:39,890
I missed a person at my house?

2106
02:49:40,970 --> 02:49:41,610
I did?

2107
02:49:47,860 --> 02:49:49,560
Oh, you're thinking grand larceny.

2108
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:51,600
Larceny just means dealing with no intent to return.

2109
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:53,300
Oh, I learned.

2110
02:49:54,620 --> 02:49:56,260
But where is Jimmy?

2111
02:49:58,140 --> 02:49:59,900
This is to my room, right?

2112
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:00,480
Yeah.

2113
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:03,140
Oh, my room.

2114
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:04,380
My room.

2115
02:50:07,770 --> 02:50:08,650
These are the cookies.

2116
02:50:09,950 --> 02:50:11,470
Jimmy will appear next morning.

2117
02:50:12,370 --> 02:50:14,070
So we gotta...

2118
02:50:14,070 --> 02:50:14,810
It does...

2119
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:17,250
If I click on me, it says...

2120
02:50:17,250 --> 02:50:17,670
Monday.

2121
02:50:20,730 --> 02:50:21,110
Okay.

2122
02:50:30,730 --> 02:50:33,930
Let's just do what we can for now here.

2123
02:50:37,950 --> 02:50:38,510
Uh...

2124
02:50:38,510 --> 02:50:40,990
Alright, I got the goods.

2125
02:50:43,230 --> 02:50:43,970
Oh my god.

2126
02:50:44,430 --> 02:50:45,430
I can't believe it.

2127
02:50:45,630 --> 02:50:47,250
After all this time...

2128
02:50:47,250 --> 02:50:48,630
Where's my application, Boyle?

2129
02:50:49,650 --> 02:50:50,650
Here, take it.

2130
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:51,670
With my thanks.

2131
02:50:53,590 --> 02:51:00,730
You know, this morning as I was making my rounds, I noticed an awful lot of television aerials on the roofs.

2132
02:51:01,570 --> 02:51:03,490
Seems like more and more each day.

2133
02:51:04,650 --> 02:51:07,330
You've got me this can just in time, youngster.

2134
02:51:08,250 --> 02:51:09,910
I may have need of it again.

2135
02:51:10,170 --> 02:51:10,830
What do you mean?

2136
02:51:10,850 --> 02:51:11,770
Wait, well, yeah, what do you mean?

2137
02:51:11,850 --> 02:51:15,550
There's another reason why Sheriff Dwayne didn't investigate the Sentinel fire.

2138
02:51:16,330 --> 02:51:20,650
If you'd like to get something else on the blackmailing bastard, check around the television station.

2139
02:51:21,490 --> 02:51:22,490
Why are you still can?

2140
02:51:23,430 --> 02:51:25,210
Oh, I think...

2141
02:51:25,990 --> 02:51:31,030
I think Postmaster Boyle has a bit of an arsonist streak.

2142
02:51:33,190 --> 02:51:34,190
I think...

2143
02:51:34,270 --> 02:51:38,070
I think now that he's done it once, he can't stop himself again.

2144
02:51:40,050 --> 02:51:41,470
To the TV station!

2145
02:51:42,190 --> 02:51:43,630
To the TV station!

2146
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:49,780
Arsonist.

2147
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:53,760
Uh...

2148
02:51:54,580 --> 02:52:02,400
If I go in here, and I talk to the big, big man, this guy, about this...

2149
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:05,740
The checkbook, let's see what he says.

2150
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:07,640
Oh, now sport.

2151
02:52:07,820 --> 02:52:11,440
This is really interesting Boyle's done something wrong.

2152
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:17,700
Otherwise the sheriff wouldn't be blackmailing him But what God I'd love to nail him to the wall.

2153
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:22,060
Yeah, and don't forget about the sheriff Dwayne is a blackmailer after all.

2154
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:22,520
Wait, no.

2155
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:35,460
Oh Yeah Sorry, I decided not to run with this story that kind of fire man, but this is all the evidence you need for your newscast Evidence of a blackmail situation canceled checks.

2156
02:52:35,480 --> 02:53:01,600
Wait, but also what about the the payment the war payment no can do matter of fact i think i may have to shoot the share of a private little news i haven't played it i'll look into it thank you i know i know it may cause you some problems but hey let's do lunch okay my treat what what wait hold on let's talk to it i hate this i hate this room don't hurry back i hate this room don't hurry back oh it's so loud

2157
02:53:09,400 --> 02:53:12,540
A fairly primitive form of mind control?

2158
02:53:13,020 --> 02:53:14,520
The apply sign?

2159
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:18,160
Okay.

2160
02:53:19,700 --> 02:53:21,920
What else am I supposed to examine here?

2161
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:28,910
I don't think any other people will talk to me.

2162
02:53:35,370 --> 02:53:35,510
Hmm.

2163
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:41,580
Let's go to the diner.

2164
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:47,260
Oh yeah, let's- oh that's right, we gotta apply for the lodge.

2165
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:49,320
Yeah, yeah.

2166
02:53:52,220 --> 02:53:52,740
Hello.

2167
02:53:54,020 --> 02:53:58,020
Um, I have my...

2168
02:53:58,020 --> 02:53:58,760
What is this?

2169
02:53:58,940 --> 02:53:59,200
Note.

2170
02:54:00,480 --> 02:54:01,560
Wait, no, where's my lodge?

2171
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:03,240
Oh, wait, I have a lodge application.

2172
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:08,420
Have you obtained an application from the postmaster?

2173
02:54:09,140 --> 02:54:15,160
If you would find knowledge, you must seek it from the first realization of the wanting.

2174
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:18,180
Oh.

2175
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:21,440
Oh, wait.

2176
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:22,400
Did I miss it?

2177
02:54:23,740 --> 02:54:24,180
Ah!

2178
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:25,800
Here it is.

2179
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:29,040
Oh, I wish I could read it.

2180
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:30,380
Oh, dang.

2181
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:32,300
I thought I would be able to know the questions.

2182
02:54:34,420 --> 02:54:34,820
Hello!

2183
02:54:36,500 --> 02:54:37,380
What is...

2184
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:39,780
I did get an autograph from this guy.

2185
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:45,120
Someone's gonna want this autograph.

2186
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:46,080
I know it.

2187
02:54:50,050 --> 02:54:50,490
Hello.

2188
02:54:50,570 --> 02:54:51,190

2191
02:55:32,750 --> 02:55:33,010
Wait!

2192
02:55:34,590 --> 02:55:36,890
Is this the same handwriting as the note?

2193
02:55:38,570 --> 02:55:41,530
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2194
02:55:41,690 --> 02:55:42,850
It might be.

2195
02:55:43,630 --> 02:55:45,290
The same writing as the note.

2196
02:55:51,310 --> 02:55:52,270
This one.

2197
02:55:55,130 --> 02:55:55,410
Maybe?

2198
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:57,710
Let's check.

2199
02:55:58,610 --> 02:55:59,170
Let's wait.

2200
02:56:00,390 --> 02:56:01,150
Show him.

2201
02:56:02,670 --> 02:56:34,130

Wait, oh.

2203
02:56:38,050 --> 02:56:39,410
Is that not your handwriting?

2204
02:56:41,030 --> 02:56:42,170
Can't talk now, Buckaroo.

2205
02:56:42,570 --> 02:56:43,810
We're on in just a sec.

2206
02:56:44,430 --> 02:56:44,890
Oh, okay.

2207
02:56:47,130 --> 02:56:48,530
Happy trails, Buckaroo.

2208
02:56:49,350 --> 02:56:50,510
Did I give him the...

2209
02:56:57,420 --> 02:56:59,340
I accidentally solved it, by the way.

2210
02:56:59,440 --> 02:57:00,140
Wait, what do you mean?

2211
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:09,800
It says boiled.

2212
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:11,340
What does it?

2213
02:57:25,700 --> 02:57:28,060
The name is on the note.

2214
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:32,480
Hold on.

2215
02:57:33,180 --> 02:57:34,980
The music is driving me crazy too.

2216
02:57:35,340 --> 02:57:37,160
I'm confused of who I've talked to.

2217
02:57:37,820 --> 02:57:38,380
And everything.

2218
02:57:39,740 --> 02:57:41,760
Boy, Sheriff Dwayne sure is...

2219
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:41,900
Okay.

2220
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:43,040
That's the same thing.

2221
02:57:44,180 --> 02:57:44,980
That's the same thing.

2222
02:57:48,730 --> 02:57:49,870
Yeah, sorry, I can't read.

2223
02:57:49,990 --> 02:57:50,470
So true.

2224
02:57:50,930 --> 02:57:53,510
Like how you can see the green screen outline of everybody.

2225
02:57:58,860 --> 02:57:59,300
What?

2226
02:58:00,260 --> 02:58:02,140
How do I fill this out?

2227
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:04,760
Where do I...

2228
02:58:04,760 --> 02:58:06,460
I don't have a pen.

2229
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:08,700
Wait, I do!

2230
02:58:09,060 --> 02:58:10,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2231
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:11,780
Hold on, let's go back to my house.

2232
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:13,120
Yeah, I have a pen!

2233
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:16,460
I say as I say I don't have a pen?

2234
02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:18,220
That's a ticket.

2235
02:58:19,240 --> 02:58:20,120
Let's see what he wrote.

2236
02:58:22,220 --> 02:58:23,980
How much do you...

2237
02:58:23,980 --> 02:58:24,600
Something something.

2238
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:25,740
Three times a day.

2239
02:58:26,780 --> 02:58:27,220
Okay.

2240
02:58:28,040 --> 02:58:29,640
First name, Steve.

2241
02:58:32,600 --> 02:58:34,180
Middle, oh, maybe middle name, last name.

2242
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:35,300
Nobody will tell me.

2243
02:58:37,420 --> 02:58:39,960
Maybe that's street something.

2244
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:42,000
City harvest.

2245
02:58:44,120 --> 02:58:45,900
How often do you eat meat?

2246
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:53,640
Do you have any physical disabilities that prove you from something, something?

2247
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:54,240
No.

2248
02:58:55,360 --> 02:58:57,020
Do you something, something, something?

2249
02:58:57,240 --> 02:58:59,240
Do you enjoy...

2250
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:02,580
People watching?

2251
02:59:02,980 --> 02:59:03,320
Yes?

2252
02:59:05,320 --> 02:59:05,640
Huh?

2253
02:59:09,630 --> 02:59:11,030
And then...

2254
02:59:11,030 --> 02:59:13,410
I don't even know what it is.

2255
02:59:16,690 --> 02:59:17,390
I...

2256
02:59:18,350 --> 02:59:19,590
Maybe they'll...

2257
02:59:19,590 --> 02:59:20,590
They say it to us later.

2258
02:59:27,120 --> 02:59:27,820
Hello!

2259
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:30,340

2260
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:30,900

2266
03:00:39,970 --> 03:00:41,190
What do you people want from me?

2267
03:00:41,410 --> 03:00:42,930
Welcome to our horror.

2268
03:00:43,910 --> 03:00:44,530

03:00:46,890 --> 03:00:48,150

2271
03:00:55,370 --> 03:00:56,650
What is...

2272
03:01:03,550 --> 03:01:04,490
Good morning!

2273
03:01:04,490 --> 03:01:04,550
Good morning!

2274
03:01:05,550 --> 03:01:08,190
We're in the same shirt as yesterday.

2275
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:13,840
18, by the way.

2276
03:01:14,340 --> 03:01:14,920
Yeah, this guy.

2277
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:21,520
I love our 30-year-old teenager.

2278
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:24,140
Yeah, maybe the kid, actually.

2279
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:28,520
Let's see if he wants the autograph.

2280
03:01:30,120 --> 03:01:31,040
Big whoopsie.

2281
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:35,660
Okay, Hank.

2282
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:37,680

2284
03:02:10,320 --> 03:02:12,980
Maybe you'd feel better if you stopped watching television and went to bed.

2285
03:02:13,620 --> 03:02:16,160
Maybe you'd be quiet with a stigma in your heart.

2286
03:02:16,720 --> 03:02:17,000
What?

2287
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:19,000
Just leave me alone, Steve.

2288
03:02:19,660 --> 03:02:22,080
Believe me, you got your own problems.

2289
03:02:23,220 --> 03:02:24,120
Oh my god!

2290
03:02:25,340 --> 03:02:25,920
Good.

2291
03:02:26,480 --> 03:02:27,360
Find them.

2292
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:30,340
My brother hates me.

2293
03:02:34,510 --> 03:02:35,970
Hello, Jimmy James.

2294
03:02:36,310 --> 03:02:38,210
Hey, did you ever find any sneakers?

2295
03:02:39,170 --> 03:02:39,770
Yes, I did.

2296
03:02:40,090 --> 03:02:41,210
Whoa, that's great.

2297
03:02:41,650 --> 03:02:42,510
Maybe we could try.

2298
03:02:42,970 --> 03:02:43,910
What could you give me?

2299
03:02:44,730 --> 03:02:47,250
You know this Waley and Principal Harold down at the school?

2300
03:02:47,430 --> 03:02:47,870
Unfortunately.

2301
03:02:47,930 --> 03:02:51,430
Well, I found out there messing around with each other in the broom closet.

2302
03:02:51,990 --> 03:02:52,170
What?

2303
03:02:52,170 --> 03:02:56,890
I can tell you when they meet and trade you some keys that'll let you catch some red-handed.

2304
03:02:57,390 --> 03:02:58,370
What do you say?

2305
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:06,960
Oh, sure.

2306
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:08,500
Take the...

2307
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:12,360
Well, here's the keys to the broom closet at Gain Memorial.

2308
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:13,820
That's where they meet every day.

2309
03:03:14,900 --> 03:03:16,720
As soon as everyone has gone home.

2310
03:03:17,680 --> 03:03:19,020
Sometimes I hide in there beforehand.

2311
03:03:19,480 --> 03:03:22,360
Daddy-o, I see some stuff that's real nasty.

2312
03:03:22,920 --> 03:03:23,780
Take it from me.

2313
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:25,240
You made a good swap.

2314
03:03:25,700 --> 03:03:27,100
See you later, alligator.

2315
03:03:28,260 --> 03:03:29,300
Jimmy James!

2316
03:03:32,260 --> 03:03:34,420
You're hiding in the broom closet!

2317
03:03:38,480 --> 03:03:39,960
Jimmy James, where?

2318
03:03:40,120 --> 03:03:41,520
What would your parents think?

2319
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:44,080
Wait, also, don't I have a newspaper?

2320
03:03:44,840 --> 03:03:47,520
Oh yeah, let's give this to him too.

2321
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:51,420
Hey, Steve, you've been doing a swell job putting the paper out in the morning.

2322
03:03:52,040 --> 03:03:55,060
You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems.

2323
03:03:55,380 --> 03:03:57,060
That's not much to ask, is it?

2324
03:03:57,520 --> 03:03:59,000
I'm scared of Jimmy James.

2325
03:04:02,440 --> 03:04:05,240
What do you, why does he talk like a mafia boss?

2326
03:04:06,960 --> 03:04:10,000
Just keep doing that and we won't have any problems, right?

2327
03:04:11,860 --> 03:04:13,060
Yeah, let's punch him.

2328
03:04:14,380 --> 03:04:14,820
Yeah.

2329
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:16,940
I've

2330
03:04:32,230 --> 03:04:33,950
been scared of Jimmy James!

2331
03:04:42,480 --> 03:04:43,180
I don't think I...

2332
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:43,740
Oh, dang it.

2333
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:47,520
I don't think I saved before the whole cutscene.

2334
03:04:54,640 --> 03:04:56,440
I didn't think it would do anything.

2335
03:05:00,700 --> 03:05:01,440
Oh, oops.

2336
03:05:02,500 --> 03:05:03,880
Pen, pen, pen.

2337
03:05:05,560 --> 03:05:06,320
That's a ticket.

2338
03:05:07,380 --> 03:05:08,240
Well, okay, wait.

2339
03:05:08,320 --> 03:05:11,480
There was one thing I think I wanted to do before I...

2340
03:05:11,600 --> 03:05:12,580
Handed in.

2341
03:05:14,540 --> 03:05:19,080
Maybe it was, I was going to try the autograph photo, but it didn't work.

2342
03:05:19,420 --> 03:05:20,240
So that's fine.

2343
03:05:20,680 --> 03:05:27,140
I just realized this is a very, very big inventory, isn't it?

2344
03:05:27,900 --> 03:05:28,420
Riposo.

2345
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:32,820
Jimmy James is kind of insane.

2346
03:05:35,420 --> 03:05:36,660
Okay, we can just skip all this.

2347
03:05:36,760 --> 03:05:37,360
So sorry, everybody.

2348
03:05:37,540 --> 03:05:37,900
I'll save.

2349
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:38,500
I'll save.

2350
03:05:39,460 --> 03:05:41,580
I say you've managed to...

2351
03:05:43,060 --> 03:05:44,840
Your sister is in a crib.

2352
03:05:45,360 --> 03:05:47,100
Yeah, yeah, I've interacted with it before.

2353
03:05:47,440 --> 03:05:48,460
Not it, sorry, the baby.

2354
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:52,300
I've interacted with the sister before.

2355
03:05:52,740 --> 03:05:53,620
I'll try again, though.

2356
03:05:53,940 --> 03:05:54,920
Okay, let's save.

2357
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:58,960
That's why you should not punch kids.

2358
03:06:00,040 --> 03:06:01,520
Scared of Jimmy James.

2359
03:06:04,780 --> 03:06:05,900
Jimmy James.

2360
03:06:13,310 --> 03:06:15,390
I didn't mean to say it, I'm sorry!

2361
03:06:16,450 --> 03:06:17,990
Oh, a newborn baby.

2362
03:06:18,090 --> 03:06:18,410
Yeah, see?

2363
03:06:19,370 --> 03:06:20,810
I interacted with her before.

2364
03:06:22,110 --> 03:06:23,430
Ew, it smells like dirty diapers.

2365
03:06:23,710 --> 03:06:24,630
Why in the kitchen?

2366
03:06:26,630 --> 03:06:28,050
Let's talk to Hank.

2367
03:06:29,650 --> 03:06:30,670
We'll ask this one.

2368
03:06:30,790 --> 03:06:31,530
Is Dad feeling any better?

2369
03:06:31,610 --> 03:06:34,510
I hear him at night, thrashing and moaning.

2370
03:06:35,370 --> 03:06:36,490
I crawl out my window.

2371
03:06:37,390 --> 03:06:39,330
I'm seeing Mom's shadow on his shade.

2372
03:06:40,150 --> 03:06:41,570
Pot holders on her hands.

2373
03:06:42,050 --> 03:06:43,030
Reaching for him.

2374
03:06:43,590 --> 03:06:45,830
How can she do the stitches on him wearing those?

2375
03:06:46,330 --> 03:06:47,930
Or didn't she slip?

2376
03:06:48,510 --> 03:06:49,130
Don't be silly.

2377
03:06:49,370 --> 03:06:50,270
I need to ask the mom about the baby.

2378
03:06:50,450 --> 03:06:51,170
Okay, okay.

2379
03:06:51,390 --> 03:06:53,090
Yeah, that's why he's not getting better.

2380
03:06:53,110 --> 03:06:53,670
Don't yell at me.

2381
03:06:55,990 --> 03:06:56,330
Good.

2382
03:06:57,190 --> 03:06:57,590
Finally.

2383
03:06:58,190 --> 03:06:58,530
Bye.

2384
03:06:59,650 --> 03:07:01,510
Okay, I'll ask the mom about the baby.

2385
03:07:01,890 --> 03:07:02,470
Hello, dear.

2386
03:07:02,650 --> 03:07:03,590
How are you today?

2387
03:07:04,650 --> 03:07:05,490
That's a baby.

2388
03:07:05,710 --> 03:07:06,250
I'll say baby.

2389
03:07:06,770 --> 03:07:06,790
Baby.

2390
03:07:07,810 --> 03:07:09,410
Stop speaking nonsense, dear.

2391
03:07:09,610 --> 03:07:11,750
Okay, you yelled at me for no reason.

2392
03:07:13,650 --> 03:07:15,470
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

2393
03:07:15,850 --> 03:07:22,410

2395
03:07:49,050 --> 03:07:51,350
you're crazier than sparky down at the firehouse.

2396
03:07:52,350 --> 03:07:54,010
Fine, maybe I am crazy.

2397
03:07:54,390 --> 03:07:55,450
I can't rule that out.

2398
03:07:55,690 --> 03:07:57,050
Why can't you just help me a little?

2399
03:07:57,410 --> 03:07:58,310
Is that too much to ask?

2400
03:07:58,310 --> 03:08:00,130
Why are there wasps in the- Uh-oh.

2401
03:08:00,430 --> 03:08:01,070
Are you happy?

2402
03:08:02,130 --> 03:08:03,010
Poor baby.

2403
03:08:03,290 --> 03:08:04,570
There, there.

2404
03:08:04,750 --> 03:08:06,190
Did your brother scare you?

2405
03:08:06,490 --> 03:08:07,390
Let me see.

2406
03:08:10,190 --> 03:08:10,630
Ah!

2407
03:08:10,870 --> 03:08:11,730
It was a snap!

2408
03:08:11,950 --> 03:08:12,590
Oh my god.

2409
03:08:14,590 --> 03:08:42,890

2410
03:08:43,050 --> 03:08:45,410
you can't miss a house covered with paper nests.

2411
03:08:46,310 --> 03:08:47,390
That's so funny.

2412
03:08:48,830 --> 03:08:50,990
By the golly, I'll take it up with the PTA.

2413
03:08:51,710 --> 03:08:52,450
Or the lodge.

2414
03:08:52,830 --> 03:08:53,710
Not the lodge.

2415
03:08:53,970 --> 03:08:54,790
What's the PTA?

2416
03:08:55,750 --> 03:08:57,790
That's a parent-teacher association, no?

2417
03:08:57,870 --> 03:08:59,790
What's the PTA got to do with anything?

2418
03:08:59,930 --> 03:09:00,830
Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

2419
03:09:00,990 --> 03:09:02,550
Show some respect, Steve.

2420
03:09:03,070 --> 03:09:05,130
The PTA has a lot of cloud in harvest.

2421
03:09:05,150 --> 03:09:05,970
Not the cloud.

2422
03:09:06,130 --> 03:09:07,670
We run the 1950s cloud.

2423
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:10,930
By gosh, we even have ties to the lodge.

Oh my gosh!

2429
03:11:10,240 --> 03:11:11,220
Searching the body!

2430
03:11:11,520 --> 03:11:12,700
You find a key and a gun!

2431
03:11:14,420 --> 03:11:15,960
I think I...

2432
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:17,040
I can't...

2433
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:17,660
I can't...

2434
03:11:17,660 --> 03:11:17,720
I can't...

2435
03:11:17,820 --> 03:11:19,820
I killed Jimmy James!

2436
03:11:30,490 --> 03:11:32,010
Oh my god!

2437
03:11:36,480 --> 03:11:37,700
Oh, I got sent to jail.

2438
03:11:43,490 --> 03:11:44,150
Um, hello?

2439
03:11:44,390 --> 03:11:48,170
Boy, in Harvest, you can't just go around killing little children in public.

2440
03:11:48,730 --> 03:11:50,830
You're under arrest for murder in the first degree.

2441
03:11:51,490 --> 03:11:52,150
Come with me.

2442
03:11:52,710 --> 03:11:54,290
This is your first arrest, Steve.

2443
03:11:54,890 --> 03:11:59,250
You just remember, we've got a three strikes, you're out rule here in Harvest.

2444
03:12:00,050 --> 03:12:01,510
But you keep your nose clean.

2445
03:12:01,910 --> 03:12:02,410
you're here.

2446
03:12:03,490 --> 03:12:04,050
Yes, sir.

2447
03:12:07,190 --> 03:12:08,630
Does that mean you can kill everyone?

2448
03:12:08,950 --> 03:12:10,270
I don't know.

2449
03:12:13,670 --> 03:12:15,350
Oh, he's tucking me in.

2450
03:12:29,940 --> 03:12:30,700
Tete, tete.

2451
03:12:31,160 --> 03:12:31,460
Amazing.

2452
03:12:31,580 --> 03:12:32,820
That's why you're the best boss.

2453
03:12:33,020 --> 03:12:33,620
Great job.

2454
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:35,260
It's literally the meme.

2455
03:12:36,140 --> 03:12:40,160
Bless your ghostly soul, Mitt, for braving yourself to go on this acid trip that is Harvester.

2456
03:12:40,440 --> 03:12:42,020
You will never unsee everything.

2457
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:44,960
Thank you, Philip.

2458
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:46,780
Congrats, Mint, you murderer.

2459
03:12:50,760 --> 03:12:52,960
Wait, so I lost a day, but like...

2460
03:12:56,520 --> 03:12:58,480
I mean, I lost a day.

2461
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:02,480
But...

2462
03:13:02,480 --> 03:13:03,700
Do we still have the god?

2463
03:13:03,840 --> 03:13:04,360
Yeah, what's in my...

2464
03:13:04,360 --> 03:13:04,700
Oh, whoops.

2465
03:13:04,820 --> 03:13:05,820
I didn't mean to click that.

2466
03:13:08,740 --> 03:13:09,340
I do!

2467
03:13:09,560 --> 03:13:11,980
And this is the broom closet key.

2468
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:13,280
Wait, I thought he was...

2469
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:14,780
Oh, I was supposed to give him the sneakers.

2470
03:13:15,300 --> 03:13:17,840
But he actually didn't give me the closet key.

2471
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:20,600
9mm pistol.

2472
03:13:31,890 --> 03:13:33,070
Mom, I killed a child.

2473
03:13:33,350 --> 03:13:33,750
Hello, dear.

2474
03:13:33,970 --> 03:13:34,870
How are you today?

2475
03:13:35,830 --> 03:13:36,150
Bye.

2476
03:13:36,890 --> 03:13:38,550
Wait, let me type in Jimmy James.

2477
03:13:39,050 --> 03:13:39,370
Jimmy.

2478
03:13:40,890 --> 03:13:41,190
Jimmy.

2479
03:13:42,190 --> 03:13:43,990
Stop speaking nonsense, dear.

2480
03:13:44,210 --> 03:13:45,770
We don't know a Jimmy here.

2481
03:13:46,670 --> 03:13:48,350
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

2482
03:13:48,750 --> 03:13:49,790
You know how he gets.

2483
03:13:50,190 --> 03:13:51,070
They don't know.

2484
03:13:51,970 --> 03:13:52,910
They don't know.

2485
03:13:53,010 --> 03:13:54,270
I've never actually seen Jimmy different.

2486
03:13:54,290 --> 03:13:55,950
Good job!

2487
03:13:59,290 --> 03:14:00,290
He's on here!

2488
03:14:03,270 --> 03:14:04,190
Jimmy hoo!

2489
03:14:07,770 --> 03:14:12,290
Okay, so we have the thing with the missile base where they want me to talk to...

2490
03:14:13,250 --> 03:14:15,930
Or they want me to investigate the firehouse.

2491
03:14:16,490 --> 03:14:18,630
I have only gone to the...

2492
03:14:18,630 --> 03:14:22,450
I only want to go to the meat plant when it's like absolutely necessary.

2493
03:14:23,790 --> 03:14:24,330
so...

2494
03:14:24,970 --> 03:14:27,450
I really don't want to do it right now.

2495
03:14:29,810 --> 03:14:31,410
Who's Jimmy James?

2496
03:14:41,020 --> 03:14:42,460
But what else?

2497
03:14:44,340 --> 03:14:46,720
Oh, we have the broom closet key now?

2498
03:14:48,420 --> 03:14:50,860
I guess let's go to the fire station.

2499
03:14:53,040 --> 03:14:54,600
Oh, and the wasp lady.

2500
03:14:54,760 --> 03:14:57,020
Actually, let's go to the top wasp lady first.

2501
03:14:57,560 --> 03:14:58,960
Yeah, Wasp Lady for my mom.

2502
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:04,120
You should show your brother.

2503
03:15:05,360 --> 03:15:06,920
It's so horrible.

2504
03:15:09,860 --> 03:15:10,280
Ta-ta!

2505
03:15:10,980 --> 03:15:13,020
It's not often that I get visitors.

2506
03:15:13,560 --> 03:15:13,840
My...

2507
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:14,000
Oh.

2508
03:15:15,440 --> 03:15:15,920
Uh...

2509
03:15:15,920 --> 03:15:16,440
Mom.

2510
03:15:17,080 --> 03:15:18,400
A triviality.

2511
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:21,120
Okay, I guess I can't talk to her then.

2512
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:24,040
Is there anything I can show her?

2513
03:15:28,430 --> 03:15:29,970
The pistol I can show her.

2514
03:15:29,990 --> 03:15:31,050
my gun.

2515
03:15:36,510 --> 03:15:37,050
Attack her?

2516
03:15:40,660 --> 03:15:41,660
Take her out?

2517
03:15:42,120 --> 03:15:42,120
Okay.

2518
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,280
Death of Jimmy James arc starting.

2519
03:15:48,720 --> 03:15:50,620
I'm fed she's gonna attack me with the bees.

2520
03:16:00,400 --> 03:16:02,380
Wait, I can't get behind her.

2521
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:03,500
Wait, I can get in front of her.

2522
03:16:04,260 --> 03:16:05,580
What is What's she eating?

2523
03:16:16,680 --> 03:16:19,940
Wait, why can't I get around her now?

2524
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:26,960
Wait, what is it?

2525
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:28,080
Right click to...

2526
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:30,180
There was something... I guess...

2527
03:16:30,180 --> 03:16:31,500
Oh, right click to arm disarm.

2528
03:16:35,010 --> 03:16:36,510
I have no bullets!

2529
03:16:38,870 --> 03:16:39,570
Oh, no.

2530
03:16:39,590 --> 03:16:39,930
No!

2531
03:16:41,970 --> 03:16:42,490
Maybe?

2532
03:16:45,710 --> 03:16:51,590
Okay, well that's good to know that we don't have any bullets because then...

2533
03:16:52,470 --> 03:16:54,590
What if I actually tried to use it for real?

2534
03:16:57,010 --> 03:16:58,470
God damn it, Jimmy.

2535
03:17:02,310 --> 03:17:04,230
Thought I saw something pop up.

2536
03:17:04,970 --> 03:17:06,010
Examine the fence.

2537
03:17:06,130 --> 03:17:09,570
Oh, the pickets of the fence gleam with a fresh coat of white paint.

2538
03:17:09,590 --> 03:17:16,770

Oh, here.

2562
03:19:18,050 --> 03:19:20,150

2563
03:19:32,810 --> 03:19:33,890

2573
03:20:48,870 --> 03:20:52,090
A glass protected fire.

2574
03:20:52,170 --> 03:20:54,030
I don't think there's anything else that I can go into.

2575
03:20:54,130 --> 03:20:54,650
Oh, okay.

2576
03:20:55,530 --> 03:20:56,510

2578
03:20:59,870 --> 03:21:01,150
Well, that didn't work.

2579
03:21:01,390 --> 03:21:02,410

2583
03:21:16,570 --> 03:21:17,130

I'm actually kind of stuck now since...

2587
03:21:35,720 --> 03:21:38,080

2588
03:21:40,440 --> 03:21:41,200
Wait, really?

2589
03:21:49,480 --> 03:21:49,780

2590
03:21:51,100 --> 03:21:54,040
I killed Jimmy with the bat.

2591
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:55,140
Ah!

2592
03:21:56,200 --> 03:21:57,600

2605
03:24:05,740 --> 03:24:07,800
How do I get Mr. Tucker to leave?

2607

03:24:16,880 --> 03:24:18,080
Walk this way.

03:24:21,480 --> 03:24:22,120
No.

2612
03:24:24,340 --> 03:24:24,660
Okay.

2613
03:24:25,360 --> 03:24:26,340
Okay, hold on.

2614
03:24:28,690 --> 03:24:29,730
One step forward.

2615
03:24:32,110 --> 03:24:32,350
Oh.

2616
03:24:33,090 --> 03:24:34,030

2617
03:24:36,370 --> 03:24:36,490
Ah.

2618
03:24:40,330 --> 03:24:42,250
Make him leave permanently.

2619
03:24:42,810 --> 03:24:44,030
He goes to the diner.

2620
03:24:44,690 --> 03:24:45,390

Why did he say his wife's name like that?

2624
03:25:59,310 --> 03:26:05,550
I'd be right applied if you could just see Claire to bringing me just one of them books.

2625
03:26:06,550 --> 03:26:10,570
Believe me, it'll be worth your time to do it.

You want another one?

They're a whole quarter, mister.

2630
03:26:19,310 --> 03:26:21,770
I don't have that money just lying around.

2631
03:26:22,770 --> 03:26:23,890
Come on!

2632
03:26:25,010 --> 03:26:26,810
I wonder if they've restocked them though.

2633
03:26:27,890 --> 03:26:28,770
For my own.

2634
03:26:29,410 --> 03:26:31,810
Wait, this is all cleaned up now.

2635
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:42,900
L-L-Lumis has loose lips?

2636
03:26:43,980 --> 03:26:45,200
The guy I was just talking to?

2637
03:26:46,760 --> 03:26:48,600
Aw man, nothing else.

2638
03:26:52,140 --> 03:26:52,480
Ah.

2639
03:26:53,640 --> 03:26:54,600
Wait, oh, exit.

2640
03:26:57,900 --> 03:26:58,460
Um...

2641
03:27:00,560 --> 03:27:01,600
Hello, Steve.

2642
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:02,060
Hi.

2643
03:27:02,060 --> 03:27:03,160
Tell you to buy anything today?

2644
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:04,620
Uh, no thanks.

2645
03:27:05,120 --> 03:27:05,800
I don't have any money.

2646
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:06,880
Okay, dear.

2647
03:27:07,460 --> 03:27:09,880
You check back if you decide there's anything you want.

2648
03:27:10,320 --> 03:27:11,480
I'll be happy to help you.

2649
03:27:11,960 --> 03:27:12,700
Come back soon.

2650
03:27:13,200 --> 03:27:13,780
Who is...

2651
03:27:13,780 --> 03:27:15,540
This is Mrs. Phelps.

2652
03:27:22,200 --> 03:27:24,760
I don't know how to make the day pass, though.

2653
03:27:27,240 --> 03:27:28,120
My house.

2654
03:27:28,860 --> 03:27:30,320
Where does even this guy live?

2655
03:27:30,360 --> 03:27:31,260
He talks about his wife.

2656
03:27:31,280 --> 03:28:03,540
but he's where does he live of mysterious I'm a little lost might be time to bust out the walkthrough Stephanie yeah we haven't seen her in a bit no thank you so much for the 50 gift thank you holy cow thank you thank you oh my gosh thank you this place is so bizarre The alien music.

2657
03:28:05,700 --> 03:28:07,800
Steve, I'm so glad you came back.

2658
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:09,820
What have you been doing?

2659
03:28:09,940 --> 03:28:10,680
Murdering children.

2660
03:28:10,860 --> 03:28:11,760
I visited the lodge.

2661
03:28:11,880 --> 03:28:11,960
Oh.

2662
03:28:12,440 --> 03:28:14,080
Talked to the sergeant-at-arms there.

2663
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:17,200
He knows that there's something out of whack here.

2664
03:28:17,520 --> 03:28:20,700
He told me if I wanted to find out what it is, I should join the lodge.

2665
03:28:21,240 --> 03:28:23,200
I've decided to join the lodge, Stephanie.

2666
03:28:23,420 --> 03:28:23,820
Uh-oh.

2667
03:28:23,940 --> 03:28:26,560
I think the answer to all our questions is inside.

2668
03:28:27,140 --> 03:28:28,960
That place...

2669
03:28:29,420 --> 03:28:30,500
It's so sinister.

2670
03:28:32,880 --> 03:28:35,120
Maybe, but I've got to join anyway.

2671
03:28:35,460 --> 03:28:37,300
You may be playing right into their hands.

2672
03:28:37,920 --> 03:28:38,780
Did you think of that?

2673
03:28:39,340 --> 03:28:41,960
Doesn't it seem like you're being herded toward the lodge?

2674
03:28:42,680 --> 03:28:44,440
That's one of the things I hope to find out.

2675
03:28:45,060 --> 03:28:46,900
I hope finding out doesn't get you killed.

2676
03:28:50,520 --> 03:28:52,820
Come back and visit me soon, okay?

2677
03:28:53,060 --> 03:28:54,080
She's so cute.

2678
03:28:56,520 --> 03:28:58,560
Um, she has nice taste.

2679
03:29:01,180 --> 03:29:02,400
That's so funny.

2680
03:29:03,520 --> 03:29:04,800
Yeah, she's got nice taste.

2681
03:29:07,180 --> 03:29:08,060
Uh, kiss her?

2682
03:29:08,300 --> 03:29:08,560
Can I?

2683
03:29:08,940 --> 03:29:10,470
I'm going to ask her if I can kiss her.

2684
03:29:12,920 --> 03:29:13,560
Excuse me.

2685
03:29:13,660 --> 03:29:15,660
Wait, I'm going to save in case she shoots me.

2686
03:29:16,080 --> 03:29:17,320
Just like Jimmy James.

2687
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:23,740
I'm glad to see you.

2688
03:29:24,700 --> 03:29:26,660
I feel so alone, cooped up in here.

2689
03:29:31,940 --> 03:29:33,520
You're not making sense.

2690
03:29:43,970 --> 03:29:44,010
Stephanie!

2691
03:29:46,330 --> 03:29:46,910

Come back and visit me soon, okay?

2693
03:29:56,790 --> 03:30:00,890
I was supposed to be sad with the music, but then it got all whimsical.

2694
03:30:05,420 --> 03:30:07,500
Stephanie, why won't you let me...

2695
03:30:07,500 --> 03:30:09,720

2696
03:30:12,920 --> 03:30:13,500

Slimy manhole key.

2756
03:35:29,560 --> 03:35:30,380

There we go.

2766
03:35:52,090 --> 03:35:56,310
If it becomes night now, Nightfall descends upon harvest.

03:35:56,710 --> 03:35:57,330
Oh, okay, okay.

03:35:58,530 --> 03:35:59,390

2770
03:35:59,750 --> 03:36:00,490

A manhole cover is locked in place.

2774
03:36:23,410 --> 03:36:25,630
Nasty stench drifts up from the sewers below.

2781
03:37:12,390 --> 03:37:15,970

Yeah, thank you.

2804
03:38:56,840 --> 03:38:59,880
The window has been bricked up and sealed off.

2805
03:39:01,600 --> 03:39:02,200
All right.

2806
03:39:03,640 --> 03:39:07,040
Mr. Johnson has a myriad of goodies on his tool bench.

2807
03:39:08,160 --> 03:39:09,800

Gas can.

2811
03:39:15,580 --> 03:39:18,420
This gas can is a similar model to the Postmaster's gas can.

2812
03:39:19,280 --> 03:39:21,060
I mean, I can't imagine there's so many, eh?

Not the only thing.

2815
03:39:28,520 --> 03:39:29,300
The window is what?

2816
03:39:36,100 --> 03:39:36,580
Flashlight.

Rubber mallet.

Poster.

2822

03:39:53,660 --> 03:39:56,200

Wait, wait, Mr. Johnson?

2825
03:40:05,700 --> 03:40:08,540
He might have amazing taste.

2826
03:40:10,040 --> 03:40:13,620
How many license plates does Mr. Johnson need for October in one year?

2827
03:40:15,040 --> 03:40:18,880
The annual blood drive has been mark down for the upcoming Saturday.

2828
03:40:18,880 --> 03:40:20,700
I thought it was Sunday.

2829
03:40:21,960 --> 03:40:24,420
The carrying case is filled with nothing but lint and sawdust.

2830
03:40:25,920 --> 03:40:26,620
Is there anything here?

2831
03:40:26,920 --> 03:40:26,920
Oh.

2832
03:40:27,940 --> 03:40:29,160
Eched in the side.

2833
03:40:29,440 --> 03:40:29,640
Oh, sorry.

2834
03:40:29,800 --> 03:40:31,240
I'm covering it, but there's a blow torch.

2835
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:33,220
Reads thinking of you, Edna.

2836
03:40:35,360 --> 03:40:35,800
Wait.

2837
03:40:36,180 --> 03:40:39,740
Eched in the side of the blow torch reads thinking of you, Edna.

2838
03:40:40,260 --> 03:40:41,220
What does that mean?

2839
03:40:42,480 --> 03:40:44,080
Wait, what the hell does that mean?

2840
03:40:53,370 --> 03:40:54,890
How do I get out of it?

2841
03:40:54,970 --> 03:40:55,270
Oh, exit.

2842
03:41:02,870 --> 03:41:05,310
Garbage bags are piled up against the wall.

2843
03:41:06,510 --> 03:41:07,730
Do I now use the key?

2844
03:41:08,770 --> 03:41:09,850
I wonder if it's a sword.

2845
03:41:10,570 --> 03:41:11,710
Use broom closet key.

2846
03:41:15,880 --> 03:41:16,400
Did it.

2847
03:41:17,960 --> 03:41:18,440
Did it.

2848
03:41:19,620 --> 03:41:20,280
Did it.

2849
03:41:23,740 --> 03:41:25,700
There was nothing else on the tool bench.

2850
03:41:26,900 --> 03:41:27,420
Okay, bye.

2851
03:41:29,360 --> 03:41:30,420
Yeah, that was not a mine.

2852
03:41:30,500 --> 03:41:32,280
They said don't hurt the car.

2853
03:41:33,760 --> 03:41:35,320
That was kind of insane.

2854
03:41:36,720 --> 03:41:37,380
La la la.

2855
03:41:38,480 --> 03:41:43,780
So we back in the mine swinging our pickaxe from side to side.

2856
03:41:53,860 --> 03:41:56,380
Can I recover the manhole?

2857
03:41:56,720 --> 03:41:56,960
No?

2858
03:41:57,960 --> 03:41:58,920
He's gonna know.

2859
03:42:00,500 --> 03:42:01,760
Get pranked!

2860
03:42:02,360 --> 03:42:03,400
Mr. Johnson!

2861
03:42:04,680 --> 03:42:05,900
Wait, it's nighttime.

2862
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:08,320
This is kind of exciting, no?

2863
03:42:08,980 --> 03:42:10,620
Wait, hold on.

2864
03:42:12,280 --> 03:42:13,480
Before we go anywhere.

2865
03:42:15,760 --> 03:42:18,220
I think I can save over this one.

2866
03:42:19,000 --> 03:42:19,920
Well, I don't know.

2867
03:42:20,060 --> 03:42:20,500
I'm scared.

2868
03:42:21,960 --> 03:42:22,640
Pranked.

2869
03:42:24,380 --> 03:42:24,720
Okay.

2870
03:42:28,300 --> 03:42:29,660
Let's, uh...

2871
03:42:29,660 --> 03:42:31,380
Check a couple places.

2872
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:34,360
Let's...

2873
03:42:34,360 --> 03:42:36,020
Maybe Edna's diner.

2874
03:42:37,120 --> 03:42:37,520
Close!

2875
03:42:39,360 --> 03:42:40,880
What do you mean, closed?

2876
03:42:41,340 --> 03:42:42,980
The diner is locked up.

2877
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:46,160
What do you mean by that?

2878
03:42:49,670 --> 03:42:50,630
The cemetery?

2879
03:42:50,830 --> 03:42:52,190
Yeah, we can go to the cemetery.

2880
03:42:52,430 --> 03:42:52,910
Spooky!

2881
03:43:09,640 --> 03:43:10,920
Mr. Podstum.

2882
03:43:12,640 --> 03:43:14,040
What are you doing here?

2883
03:43:15,640 --> 03:43:18,360
What are you doing here at this hour, Mr. Potsdam?

2884
03:43:19,460 --> 03:43:19,920
Potsdam.

2885
03:43:21,980 --> 03:43:23,000
I'm burying our cat.

2886
03:43:23,320 --> 03:43:24,920
She passed away, and I'm burying her.

2887
03:43:25,300 --> 03:43:27,060
Go away and mind your own business.

2888
03:43:27,900 --> 03:43:29,340
Then, where's the cat?

2889
03:43:29,980 --> 03:43:31,380
I left her at home.

2890
03:43:31,740 --> 03:43:33,000
Now leave me alone!

2891
03:43:40,320 --> 03:43:44,060
This kind of stuff can come back to haunt you.

2892
03:43:46,480 --> 03:43:47,080
Matches.

2893
03:43:47,080 --> 03:43:49,120
Matches prepared especially for your...

2894
03:43:49,220 --> 03:43:49,760
Wedding.

2895
03:44:00,540 --> 03:44:01,100
Potsdam.

2896
03:44:01,680 --> 03:44:04,660
Isn't this the Potsdam crypt?

2897
03:44:05,200 --> 03:44:05,580
Yeah.

2898
03:44:06,380 --> 03:44:08,080
What is he doing here?

2899
03:44:10,480 --> 03:44:13,000
V and y'all, welcome back to Vembership, thank you.

2900
03:44:13,520 --> 03:44:14,180
Thank you.

2901
03:44:15,420 --> 03:44:15,860
Hmm.

2902
03:44:16,740 --> 03:44:18,180
Do you still have the gas?

2903
03:44:18,260 --> 03:44:18,920
I don't think so.

2904
03:44:19,220 --> 03:44:19,500
No.

2905
03:44:24,770 --> 03:44:26,030
Let's see, where else can we go?

2906
03:44:27,010 --> 03:44:28,470
Um, the TV station maybe?

2907
03:44:29,550 --> 03:44:30,330
Can we go inside?

2908
03:44:30,790 --> 03:44:32,190
The TV station is closed.

2909
03:44:34,050 --> 03:44:38,170
I thought someone said I missed something, but I don't know from where.

2910
03:44:44,340 --> 03:44:48,160
Do you walk like the guy in the game IRL?

2911
03:44:49,400 --> 03:44:49,960
Absolutely.

2912
03:44:51,320 --> 03:44:53,340
The meat plant only has day shifts.

2913
03:44:54,060 --> 03:44:56,060
There's so many cats around here.

2914
03:44:56,080 --> 03:44:56,920
Why does it have to...

2915
03:44:56,920 --> 03:44:57,940
I hate...

2916
03:44:57,940 --> 03:45:06,800
I was like, okay, you can be as stupid and you can be as vulgar and you can be as edgy as you want, but just leave the animals out of it.

2917
03:45:08,080 --> 03:45:09,420
It's my only thing.

2918
03:45:09,620 --> 03:45:11,400
I don't care about your dark humor.

2919
03:45:11,600 --> 03:45:13,280
Just leave the animals out.

2920
03:45:15,740 --> 03:45:21,940
It's not one thing that annoys me about horror games is when they do stuff to the pets.

2921
03:45:23,940 --> 03:45:24,340
Yeah.

2922
03:45:25,660 --> 03:45:26,060
Yeah.

2923
03:45:27,260 --> 03:45:27,980
Let's see.

2924
03:45:28,220 --> 03:45:29,820
I imagine everything else will be closed.

2925
03:45:30,120 --> 03:45:32,660
I'll go back here and see if there was anything, though.

2926
03:45:34,660 --> 03:45:37,540
I really thought I got everything, but I'll double check.

2927
03:45:42,680 --> 03:45:43,620
Johnson's, apparently.

2928
03:45:44,840 --> 03:45:44,840
Okay.

2929
03:45:46,520 --> 03:45:47,100
Let's see.

2930
03:45:48,400 --> 03:45:49,780
Zam and the bags.

2931
03:45:52,360 --> 03:45:53,400
A dolly.

2932
03:45:54,300 --> 03:45:56,720
This dolly might be useful after the wedding.

2933
03:45:57,020 --> 03:45:57,620
Oh, okay.

2934
03:45:57,760 --> 03:45:58,500
We're just...

2935
03:45:58,980 --> 03:46:00,640
Just stealing that.

2936
03:46:02,460 --> 03:46:04,480
Yeah, I think I need that for the wedding.

2937
03:46:08,160 --> 03:46:11,240
Oh, I'll double check the guide if there's anything else too.

2938
03:46:17,200 --> 03:46:17,760
Um...

2939
03:46:17,760 --> 03:46:18,540
Oh, let's see.

2940
03:46:19,420 --> 03:46:19,980
Uh...

2941
03:46:21,420 --> 03:46:22,640
And the pitchfork.

2942
03:46:22,980 --> 03:46:24,400
Oh, take a screwdriver.

2943
03:46:24,940 --> 03:46:27,520
Oh, it's telling me to use the screwdriver on the car.

2944
03:46:28,620 --> 03:46:29,060
Oh!

2945
03:46:29,580 --> 03:46:31,560
But I use the key instead!

2946
03:46:33,940 --> 03:47:57,820
I was I was resourceful with my with oh okay okay well we'll take it just in case I need it later okay anyway I think we can go tell them that we did the scratching you can key it with any key it's smart never knew that yeah that's such a because you know when I think of like keying a car like that's why I figured the key would be the thing to use it with that's so fun must be for those who don't have the key yet probably that's a nice way to know i've heard that this game can like soft lock you so i guess that's one of the ways that they attempted to not soft lock you garbage person welcome to membership thank you so you have completed your first task now that you've scratched the tucker you may proceed to your second task you will steal a bolt of fabric from the fireman and bring it to be fabric the lodge is comprised of thieves okay I don't need a novel to pigeonhole that it exerts control over is

2947
03:48:01,680 --> 03:48:10,600
not a fact whatever you may think of the order is only speculation You just talk so slowly.

2948
03:48:13,360 --> 03:48:14,960
Is this the Thieves Guild?

2949
03:48:26,160 --> 03:48:26,600
Okay.

2950
03:48:27,240 --> 03:48:28,600
Oh my god, okay.

2951
03:48:29,260 --> 03:48:29,320
Okay.

2952
03:48:29,320 --> 03:48:31,920
The decaying corpse that is your memory.

2953
03:48:32,540 --> 03:48:33,200
You'll be back.

2954
03:48:33,700 --> 03:48:36,760
The only answer for you is here, Steven.

2955
03:48:37,100 --> 03:48:37,500
Okay.

2956
03:48:38,100 --> 03:48:39,200
Don't forget that.

2957
03:48:51,110 --> 03:48:53,170
He sounds like a...

2958
03:48:53,650 --> 03:48:55,530
I'm trying to do my demon voice.

2959
03:48:57,130 --> 03:49:00,990
Steven, the only place for you is here, Steven.

2960
03:49:01,410 --> 03:49:02,650
No, no, not again.

2961
03:49:06,110 --> 03:49:06,430
Oh!

2962
03:49:10,000 --> 03:49:11,420
I'm saving you guys!

2963
03:49:12,360 --> 03:49:12,950
The shirtless...

2964
03:49:13,400 --> 03:49:13,440
Ah!

2965
03:49:24,390 --> 03:49:25,870
It's pouring.

2966
03:49:26,850 --> 03:49:29,150
The old man is snowing.

2967
03:49:31,890 --> 03:49:36,310
I love the burger.

2968
03:49:39,070 --> 03:49:43,170
The burger is the absolute best part.

2969
03:49:53,370 --> 03:49:55,770
Hold the pepperoni.

2970
03:49:57,430 --> 03:49:59,770
We're not body shaming here.

2971
03:50:01,110 --> 03:50:03,710
It's just not what I want to see at the moment.

2972
03:50:06,070 --> 03:50:06,890
Let's see.

2973
03:50:06,990 --> 03:50:09,550
Well, guys, I think I'm gonna call it here.

2974
03:50:10,750 --> 03:50:12,590
I think we'll call it here.

2975
03:50:13,550 --> 03:50:14,170
Pepperoni.

2976
03:50:20,390 --> 03:50:21,010
Um...

2977
03:50:21,010 --> 03:50:23,930
This game is, uh...

2978
03:50:25,230 --> 03:50:25,850
Well...

2979
03:50:31,010 --> 03:50:32,810
This game is a fever dream.

2980
03:50:33,530 --> 03:50:35,090
What's the burger all about?

2981
03:50:36,090 --> 03:50:37,250
This game is bananas.

2982
03:50:42,820 --> 03:50:46,480
I don't understand what's going on at all.

2983
03:50:48,260 --> 03:50:51,000
But I'm here for the ride.

2984
03:50:53,540 --> 03:51:03,060
I'm here to experience something that I felt I have never experienced in life or after life.

2985
03:51:05,780 --> 03:51:06,560
It is a game.

2986
03:51:06,700 --> 03:51:09,400
I'm going to spoil myself a little bit.

2987
03:51:09,900 --> 03:51:40,600
reading ahead but oh wow okay okay i just wanted to see how many days there were okay and we're on well i guess we're on day three no it gets insane i'm very excited for that i'm very excited for that hot dog hamburger thanks for the quality time don't say that Thank you,

2988
03:51:40,660 --> 03:51:41,360
SleeperDiam.

2989
03:51:42,200 --> 03:51:42,740
How many are there?

2990
03:51:42,860 --> 03:51:43,760
There's six days.

2991
03:51:46,400 --> 03:51:47,000
And...

2992
03:51:47,000 --> 03:51:49,480
So most violent adventure game of all time, you say.

2993
03:51:49,960 --> 03:51:51,520
Mostly been crimes against decency.

2994
03:51:55,260 --> 03:51:56,460
Quality time.

2995
03:51:57,800 --> 03:51:59,900
Yeah, I'm excited to see the more...

2996
03:52:04,180 --> 03:52:05,420
See what happens there.

2997
03:52:08,040 --> 03:52:08,640
But...

2998
03:52:10,580 --> 03:52:13,260
Are you playing with the sensor on?

2999
03:52:15,680 --> 03:52:16,280
I...

3000
03:52:16,280 --> 03:52:17,880
Part of me says yes.

3001
03:52:18,200 --> 03:52:19,900
Part of me says...

3002
03:52:20,780 --> 03:52:21,900
You know...

3003
03:52:23,540 --> 03:52:28,040
Yes, it's real people, but it's also special effects, so I'm kind of like...

3004
03:52:28,680 --> 03:52:29,280
Hmm...

3005
03:52:29,280 --> 03:52:30,180
I don't know yet.

3006
03:52:31,720 --> 03:52:33,400
I will remember Jimmy.

3007
03:52:34,260 --> 03:52:35,340
Jimmy James.

3008
03:52:39,600 --> 03:52:41,820
Oh wait, you mean like sensor in the game?

3009
03:52:42,280 --> 03:52:43,880
Oh no, I don't have that.

3010
03:52:44,420 --> 03:52:45,100
I have sensor.

3011
03:52:45,580 --> 03:52:46,360
I have this sensor.

3012
03:52:46,560 --> 03:52:48,180
Which we really didn't even need.

3013
03:52:49,620 --> 03:52:51,340
Thank you for playing these older games.

3014
03:52:51,800 --> 03:52:53,000
Yeah, thank you, Andy.

3015
03:52:53,780 --> 03:52:55,320
Thank you, thank you.

3016
03:52:56,460 --> 03:52:59,400
Yeah, kind of missed we didn't have more time with Jimmy, but whatever.

3017
03:53:02,460 --> 03:53:02,840
Whatever.

3018
03:53:06,300 --> 03:53:07,880
