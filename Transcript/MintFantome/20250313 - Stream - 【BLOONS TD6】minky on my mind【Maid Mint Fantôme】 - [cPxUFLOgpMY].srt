00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,600
Hello, Minky.

2
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Wait, hold on.

3
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm trying to figure out where I put my drink.

4
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,820
I'll just leave it where it's at.

5
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,960
Ice monkey drink.

6
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,000
No...

7
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840
It's milk tea.

8
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,920
Milk... wait.

9
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,380
Milk tea...

10
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,980
Minky...

11
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,120
With ice...

12
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
Ice Minky!

13
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,060
Wait!

14
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,360
I think it works!

15
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,670
I'm not reaching, am I?

16
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,890
The prophecy.

17
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,030
The prophecy.

18
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,930
I'm not reaching, right?

19
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:17,910
No.

20
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,350
I could never.

21
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,970
I got my plush into the jar, it goes...

22
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,230
No!

23
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,650
No jar.

24
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,070
Actually, maybe it's for your safety.

25
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,590
Thank you, Burly!

26
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,430
My tapestry came in the mail yesterday.

27
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,330
Teru-pon-one?

28
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,150
I saw that.

29
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,950
Some other people were receiving theirs, too.

30
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,310
Minto, do you know if there will be a restock of merch?

31
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,790
I was able to grab some of it, but a couple things I had my eye on got past me.

32
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,350
No worries if you don't know.

33
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,050
Like... some things?

34
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,050
Like...

35
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:05,970
Like...

36
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,830
Oh...

37
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,630
I think, like, we'll have...

38
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,150
I think...

39
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,930
I know the blocks I don't plan on doing a restock of.

40
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,120
And...

41
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,810
The mugs I might do a restock of.

42
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,270
I think.

43
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,130
You can't reach too far with those short arms, anyway.

44
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,930
What are you talking about?

45
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,330
Welcome back.

46
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,370
Thanks, Pendo!

47
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,830
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,470
What if we held hands on the banana farm?

49
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,850
Wait, I gotta get my dailies.

50
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,190
I was scared, because I got a new computer, right?

51
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,530
Teru-minto tapestry.

52
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,810
Thank you for the gift, Minto.

53
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,550
Of course!

54
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,770
Congrats on winning.

55
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,950
Got my plushie too.

56
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,030
It's so firm and punchable.

57
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,710
It is really firm, though.

58
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,450
It was even firmer before, and I had to say, like, hey, can you soften her up a little bit?

59
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,930
Can you soften her up a little bit?

60
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,550
What was I saying, though?

61
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,790
Uh...

62
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,690
Oh, yeah, I got a new computer not too long ago, right?

63
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,390
And so I had to reinstall the game.

64
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,010
And when I did...

65
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,550
Oh my gosh, so many pops to Murmonkey.

66
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:55,490
When I did, it made me do the tutorial again, and then also I didn't have my account.

67
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,890
And I was like, oh no!

68
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,110
Where's the cloud save?

69
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,110
But, as you can see, all is well.

70
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,550
Hi, Mintope, you're doing well.

71
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,670
Get Gator.

72
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,710
My friend Aphen says he's investing in sexy Mint stocks.

73
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,310
Oh, I thought you meant... I thought it said socks.

74
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,750
I was like, no, my socks are not for sale.

75
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,190
Stocks.

76
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,530
Are these stocks sold somewhere specifically?

77
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,190
I'm the wolf of Wall Street?

78
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,950
What does that mean, actually?

79
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,190
Wait...

80
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,450
I'm the ghost of Wall Street?

81
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,570
I'm the ghost of Wall Street's past.

82
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,110
It's a movie.

83
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,170
It doesn't have a meaning?

84
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,290
No?

85
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,630
Or...

86
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,670
Welcome back, Mintope.

87
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,770
Thank you, Snow.

88
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,990
No worries, no big deal, by the way.

89
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,390
Welcome back.

90
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,030
Thanks, Brandon.

91
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,450
Just say so.

92
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,030
Welcome to membership.

93
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,730
Thank you.

94
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,450
My oshi, Pat Fusty.

95
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,550
Pat is... Wait, new?

96
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,250
What do you mean, new?

97
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,270
Pat... This is Pat Fusty, everybody.

98
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,010
Kaiju Pat?

99
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,170
Wait, it looks so good.

100
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,750
New skins?

101
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:46,410
Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky...

102
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,190
Thank you, Pyroboog!

103
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,490
Thank you for the Akadono!

104
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,410
Thank you!

105
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,270
I appreciate it.

106
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,910
If you guys couldn't tell, I switched out the Minky to the Akadono...

107
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,690
Instead.

108
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,890
So the Arigato Arigato to Spongebag is now the 50 and then the Minky is the 100.

109
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,850
Nice aka sound.

110
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,390
Thank you.

111
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,970
Wait, I think I've seen this one before.

112
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,550
Oh my gosh.

113
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,950
Harlequin is such a good name though.

114
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,510
It's so freaking cute.

115
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,050
Octo Jones.

116
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,850
I still like mine the best.

117
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,750
I'm not gonna lie.

118
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,950
Our current Soda skin is pretty great.

119
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:35,970
Snow.

120
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,330
Hi Minky.

121
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,110
Thank you guys for all the memberships.

122
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:41,790
Welcome back.

123
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

124
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,530
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back.

125
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,030
Sexy Mint Socks sounds like great merch.

126
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,070
I don't know about that.

127
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,010
My socks however are for sale.

128
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,070
Oh, you heard it here folks.

129
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,950
Ocean Guardian.

130
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,810
Rosalia.

131
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,430
She new?

132
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,080
I've seen these ones.

133
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,560
I've seen these ones.

134
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:19,980
This one?

135
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,440
Smudge Cat.

136
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,180
Okay.

137
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,680
I like the cat.

138
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,240
Nerd.

139
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,220
Oh my gosh, literal nerd.

140
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,700
Did you just say nerd?

141
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:38,810
Okay.

142
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,530
Lifeguard.

143
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,230
Brickla.

144
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,810
Sleepy.

145
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,410
Happy birthday to Aru from Blue Archive.

146
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,950
One of my most favorite fail girls ever.

147
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,110
Wait, is it Aru's birthday?

148
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,110
No way.

149
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,410
I love Aru.

150
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,150
She's so silly.

151
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,230
I mean though, I hope you're doing well.

152
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:01,950
I am.

153
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,030
Thank you.

154
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,970
My name is Minky.

155
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,810
Son of Minky.

156
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,450
Blue Archive Aru is so good.

157
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,350
Okay so, thank you for the 5 gifted Reku.

158
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,650
Thank you so much.

159
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,290
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

160
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,770
Gator.

161
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,210
Thanks for the 5 gifted Gator.

162
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,680
So, I have...

163
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,620
My reason for choosing Bloons today is because...

164
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
My brain is empty.

165
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
Brain's slow.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,940
I had to go to the dealership to get...

167
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,660
Well, I haven't gotten a new boomobile.

168
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,080
For those who don't know, my car broke down.

169
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,980
So, I'm on the hunt.

170
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,440
Or the haunt.

171
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,900
For a new car.

172
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,780
Actually, they loaned me one so I can try it for the night.

173
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,300
And I was driving it around a little bit right before stream.

174
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,220
I think I really like it.

175
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,000
Obviously, I'm not going to say what it is.

176
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,240
Obviously.

177
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,900
But I do like it.

178
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,260
So, yeah, free car.

179
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,680
BMW.

180
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,640
Pool Minky Wheels time.

181
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,440
Let's go.

182
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,760
Finally done with finance.

183
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,040
Year-end money sign.

184
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,260
Finally approved my long weekend vacation.

185
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,580
I can breathe a little.

186
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,220
Thanks for all your content these past three months helped me survive.

187
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,420
Ghost mint!

188
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,900
Is it mint colored?

189
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,620
Oh my gosh.

190
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,580
When I was driving it earlier, I was just like...

191
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,140
I'm going to have to resist probably.

192
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,960
I want an Itasha.

193
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
I must resist though.

194
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,320
I must resist the Itasha urge.

195
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,240
Get one with ejection seats.

196
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,220
What is that?

197
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
I was just thinking today, oh man, I wonder when Minky will play Bloons again.

198
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,000
Lucky day for you.

199
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
Minky, it was my birthday while you were in Japan.

200
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,720
I'll have an exam later today.

201
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,520
Please send me the best of luck.

202
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,680
Meow yellow!

203
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,620
Happy, happy boppy.

204
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,460
And also, good luck with your exams!

205
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,080
Happy birthday to you.

206
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,440
Happy birthday to you.

207
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,960
Happy birthday, meow yellow.

208
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,200
Meow yellow?

209
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,180
Happy birthday to you.

210
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,820
Boomobile.

211
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,760
Now my boomobile.

212
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,820
Is it possible if you can do co-op?

213
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't think I'll do co-op today.

214
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,800
But thanks for asking.

215
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,520
What kind of Itasha would you do?

216
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,360
Probably Blue Archive.

217
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,500
Something about stopping pregnancy.

218
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,040
Oh my gosh, that was Bloons, wasn't it?

219
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,640
That famous clip.

220
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,620
That clip went kind of everywhere.

221
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,240
Now I'm known for that.

222
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,840
I can't believe that was Bloons.

223
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,300
No way.

224
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,560
The ovary map.

225
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,240
Where it all began.

226
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,520
This one!

227
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,340
No!

228
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,300
No way.

229
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,220
I thought that was a toothbrush for a second.

230
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,040
Today, I kind of want to get to like a level 200.

231
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,240
That's my goal.

232
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,400
I'm still recovering from not only just a jet lag.

233
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,580
My battles against the jet hag continue.

234
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,740
But also...

235
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:43,460
I went to the dealership but that made my brain hurt.

236
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,020
You guys praise me.

237
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,460
I went and I was brave.

238
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,360
Praise me.

239
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,080
Say good job, Minto.

240
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,320
Good job.

241
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,880
You did such a good job.

242
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Good, Minky.

243
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
You did so good.

244
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
I was so brave.

245
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,340
Yeah, I was really brave.

246
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
I didn't let them boss me around.

247
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,280
I was practicing saying no.

248
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,840
They were like, do you want to take this home with you today?

249
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,880
And I said no.

250
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,500
And then they were like, do you want to take it home with you tonight for a loan?

251
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,000
And I said, oh, yeah.

252
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,500
And I was like, is it free?

253
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,040
And they said, no, it's $500 per hour.

254
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,320
No, per mile.

255
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,860
And I was like...

256
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,060
And then they were like, it's a joke.

257
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,090
They had humor.

258
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,690
Thank you so much for the 5 Gets.

259
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,410
Thank you.

260
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,630
Good job, Minky.

261
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,410
Very brave girls.

262
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,070
Thank you.

263
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,430
You're pretty good.

264
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,330
Thank you for all the praise.

265
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

266
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,230
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

267
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,410
Yeah, they were jorking it.

268
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,450
I mean, yeah.

269
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:15,970
No.

270
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,410
Yeah, they were just jorking.

271
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:28,980
Spank!

272
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,300
Thank you for the 30 gifted!

273
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,500
You changed your profile picture.

274
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,960
I didn't recognize you for a second.

275
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,640
In front of the cars?

276
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,500
Because of the cars.

277
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,320
I do like the one that I have right now.

278
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,340
The loaned one.

279
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,400
I might get it.

280
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,820
I'm gonna try driving it more tomorrow.

281
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,460
And make my decision.

282
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,420
Let's see.

283
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,500
Let's start playing.

284
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,620
I don't know.

285
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,100
I don't know.

286
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,380
I wanna get to level 200, but it's been a while since I've played.

287
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,440
Maybe I take it a little bit easy.

288
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,200
Maybe the frozen one.

289
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
A loner.

290
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,180
Yeah, a loner.

291
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,980
Just like me.

292
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,620
Ducky!

293
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,620
Thanks for the 5 Gifts.

294
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,620
Thank you.

295
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,360
Thank you, thank you.

296
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,000
Good job, Minky.

297
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,420
Buying a car is super intimidating.

298
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,620
Stay strong, get that B.A.

299
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,240
Itachi route.

300
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,580
No!

301
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,180
I won't get it.

302
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,860
I'll dream about it though.

303
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,920
Hope your car situation shapes up.

304
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,420
Stay, Minky.

305
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,680
Thank you, Shinzulu!

306
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,260
Hot dog.

307
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,440
Resort is good map for getting high levels.

308
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:46,880
Is it?

309
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,100
Wait.

310
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,640
Resort is...

311
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:50,980
Wow.

312
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,440
Hashtag ouchie ouch.

313
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:53,860
Resort.

314
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,280
Oh, this one!

315
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,800
Oh yeah, this is an easy one, huh?

316
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,560
Hello?

317
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,280
Are you an otaku too?

318
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,060
Okay.

319
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,060
I haven't done hard mode.

320
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,480
To get the money money.

321
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,460
Wait, yes I have.

322
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,840
What is this one?

323
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
What's the last... I don't have the...

324
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,500
I want the money money.

325
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,990
You like the spooky one?

326
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,050
This one?

327
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,290
Yeah.

328
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,390
I like this map better.

329
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,790
The cabin feels spookier than this one.

330
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,130
This one feels forced, right?

331
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,620
Impoppable and chimps.

332
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,380
Impop... Impoppable.

333
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,880
What's the chimps?

334
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,760
I mean...

335
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,940
It's blooms.

336
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,000
It's nine months.

337
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,020
It has to be died.

338
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,480
No!

339
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,260
I forget these are things.

340
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,280
YouTube never... They never remind me either.

341
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,260
I always forget too.

342
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,480
Impoppable.

343
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,340
Have you considered a surplus Humvee from a government auction site?

344
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,820
Can you imagine just driving that around casually?

345
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,600
Let's go with the medium.

346
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,340
Whole military only.

347
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,880
Reverse!

348
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,940
We get extra money.

349
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,520
What's the sandbox?

350
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,240
I guess we have to do... So reverse...

351
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,740
Means that they just come from the other way.

352
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,580
I feel like it wouldn't make so much of a difference.

353
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,760
We lose this part right here though.

354
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,060
Humvee got stolen recently?

355
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,330
I would drive over other cars if I had that.

356
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,030
I would be like, look out!

357
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,650
Minky incoming!

358
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,730
I'm gonna try reverse.

359
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,230
On some maps it really does and on a lot of maps it's no different.

360
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,850
I feel this one is no different so we'll be fine.

362
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,830
I know Soda goes good here so we'll stick her right in there.

363
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,790
But...

364
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,750
This one I think it's okay to have it reversed.

365
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,370
We'll try.

366
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,950
Today... Today I...

367
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,450
I...

368
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,390
Today...

369
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,050
Today my brain...

370
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,970
Can you guys help me?

371
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,810
Do you guys mind helping me out today?

372
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,450
And then just try not to get too backseated.

373
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,670
But...

374
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,890
Let her cook.

375
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,310
No!

376
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,230
That's the issue.

377
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,190
Don't let me cook.

378
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,990
We missed out on some.

379
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,110
Get him Soda.

380
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,830
Good job.

381
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,190
Yeah, just lay off the caps lock.

382
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,490
Yeah.

383
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,830
You can tell me just don't caps lock.

384
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,190
Not tomorrow.

385
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,890
Today!

386
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,670
Joshua!

387
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,990
Thank you so much for the five gifts.

388
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,470
Today.

389
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,370
Today.

390
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,330
Welcome back Minto.

391
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,990
Thank you.

392
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,210
Boy no worky.

393
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,270
I fear that maybe my brain will be broken.

394
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,370
For...

395
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,330
For indefinite.

396
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,990
I will not help.

397
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:41,930
Okay.

398
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,590
Brain gooder finds.

399
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,330
Thank you.

400
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,130
Actually, no.

401
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,230
You need those more than I do.

402
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,590
You need those more than I do.

403
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,270
Thank you.

404
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,250
Brain is currently running in safe mode.

405
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,990
It's true.

406
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,250
The way she like...

407
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,950
Her head.

408
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,850
She's stretching baby.

409
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,690
She's stretching.

410
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,050
It's also been a minute since I've played Bloons.

411
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,370
So I'm like... Oh gosh.

412
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,110
How do I...

413
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,110
Joshua is like...

414
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,190
For 200 you should get a dark temple.

415
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,150
You need... Wait, I don't even...

416
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,850
Wait, I don't have...

417
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,950
Super monkey.

418
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,670
Wait, I don't have that unlocked.

419
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,920
Magic military primary $40k then upgrade super for...

420
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,960
Is this real?

421
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,440
Is this real?

422
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,380
Place ice monkey.

423
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,000
Got it.

424
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,240
Wait, I can't joke around with that because my... Actually, when I was doing the tutorial earlier...

425
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,820
When I was doing the tutorial earlier... My mouse is having issues yesterday.

426
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,500
If you watch the karaoke...

427
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
You'll know that my mouse is having a bit of issues.

428
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,600
And so when I was doing the tutorial it was like placing monkeys in places I didn't want to place them.

429
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,020
Engineer bottom path is pretty broken.

430
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,340
No way.

431
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,220
Engineer... I want the mermonkey.

432
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,220
Oh sorry, my big ol' head.

433
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:28,720
Mermonkey.

434
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,980
Engineer is this guy, no?

435
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,040
I guess I can place him.

436
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,420
What if I just have engineers all the way lined here?

437
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,340
Let's put him in.

438
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,260
I'm gonna get him some XP, you know?

439
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,080
Counter offer to last guy.

440
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,960
0-0-0 ice monkey.

441
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,580
0-0-0 ice monkey will get us to level 200.

442
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,580
Trust.

443
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,280
40 ice monkeys.

444
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,700
Trust the 0-0-0 ice monkey.

445
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,240
What is that thumbnail?

446
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,540
It's me.

447
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,860
It's me.

448
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,320
Oh wait, we have quite a bit now.

449
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,400
No?

450
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,620
It's me not having time to create a thumbnail because I had to go to the car dealership.

451
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,580
Friend's birthday and they're a huge fan.

452
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,300
Can you say happy birthday, Maple?

453
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Of course I can.

454
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,220
Aww, you're a nice friend.

455
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,120
Happy birthday, Maple!

456
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,580
Happy birthday to you.

457
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,720
Happy birthday to you.

458
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,940
Happy birthday, dear Maple.

459
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,180
Happy birthday to you.

460
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,380
Happy birthday.

461
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,160
Happy birthday.

462
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,050
So we're just gonna try and...you know what?

463
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,330
Yeah.

464
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,250
Spend all the money, baby!

465
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,110
Oh, he's so fast.

466
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,550
He's so fast.

467
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,090
He's so fast!

468
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,550
I'm gonna line it up here.

469
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,830
Maximize.

470
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,050
Maximize engineer monkey.

471
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:24,930
Wait, oh no.

472
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,650
My mouse.

473
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:32,850
Maximize.

474
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,860
I maximized, but...this guy's just too good.

475
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,200
Actually, too fast.

476
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,380
A little cash to put towards a snake car rub.

477
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,200
A snake car rub!

478
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,460
So everyone in town knows you're cool.

479
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,800
We'll do Octocam on my car.

480
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,120
Thank you guys though, I really appreciate it.

481
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,620
Middle path is the best one.

482
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,620
We can...we can do everything we want to do.

483
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,080
We can.

484
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,840
Someone said that the bottom path is broken though.

485
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,220
I just blindly believe you guys.

486
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,000
Maybe I like you guys too much.

487
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,400
Someone says something and I'm like, I believe you.

488
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,400
This is how I get one guy wrong, maybe.

489
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,840
Thank you so much for the five minutes.

490
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,960
Bottom path gives you money.

491
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,140
Wait, does?

492
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,280
Money, money, baby.

493
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,220
Oh, for this one.

494
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,000
Balloon trap captures balloons until full.

495
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,520
Empty for cash!

496
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,720
This guy though can be the...this path.

497
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,840
Oh, I don't wanna...

498
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,080
Unlock.

499
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,740
Gross!

500
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,520
I don't know if I like that sound.

501
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,140
Bottom path will make you money.

502
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,900
We're gonna be rich, baby, once we...once we get there.

503
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,140
For maximum big snake energy, get a Dodge Viper or Shelby Cobra.

504
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,400
Yeah.

505
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,500
Not to say too much about my car.

506
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,340
Because, you know, some people were saying like, oh, it might be this.

507
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,100
It might...it's probably this issue, but it's not.

508
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,140
And also like, oh, it probably would just be cheaper to, you know, buy or to fix it.

509
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,260
If it's...if that's the problem, then buy a whole new car.

510
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,760
But you guys have to understand that my car...

511
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,320
I already...I already sunk like twelve hundred dollars into it recently for the brakes.

512
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,760
And then the brakes started acting up again.

513
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,160
Like, not even a month later.

514
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,280
And then the windows, they don't really go up and down anymore.

515
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,640
Well, one of them does.

516
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,140
But they're...it's really bad.

517
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,160
And then there's a touch panel on the middle.

518
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,680
And that completely stopped working.

519
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,020
And then there's also the transmission thing that happened.

520
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:39,140
So, quite honestly, I just...I think it's just better to get a new one.

521
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,680
Yes.

522
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,200
So, yeah.

523
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,300
Yeah, I've been like, kind of just like, you know, dealing with it.

524
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,700
Because it still drove.

525
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,280
And I was like, yeah, you know, I'll still drive it.

526
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,360
Can we upgrade?

527
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,100
No, not yet.

528
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,960
Oh, close, close, close.

529
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,180
This is good, this is good.

530
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,600
So far, we're killing it right now.

531
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,310
Sounds dangerous if the brakes don't work properly.

532
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,610
I'm already dead.

533
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,350
What does it matter to me?

534
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,070
I guess it matters to living people.

535
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,230
Zero...oh, X5, X engineer buffs everyone around by 66.

536
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,930
Oh, well, that's this guy.

537
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,070
We'll be doing this one.

538
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,050
Hopefully we get enough XP for both, no?

539
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,990
Let's see.

540
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,030
Unlock this.

541
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,950
Now we can start making cash money.

542
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,640
Yay!

543
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,780
Rip OL commuter car.

544
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,030
How do I open it?

545
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,950
Ninky Lamborghini!

546
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,130
How's the audio, by the way?

547
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,370
It sounds kind of loud, no?

548
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,920
Crisp.

549
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,200
It's good?

550
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,620
A little loud?

551
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,080
I'll turn it down just a bit.

552
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,480
Oh wait, maybe it's this one.

553
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,160
We'll go back here.

554
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,640
There we go.

555
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,520
Make it louder.

556
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,960
How do I open it?

557
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,740
How do I get my money out?

558
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,080
How do I get...

559
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,900
How do I get the money out?

560
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,560
Wait until it fills.

561
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,360
How do I know when it's full?

562
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,420
Oh, that's how much it sells.

563
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,260
My bushi is back.

564
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,580
Thank you, Iris!

565
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,050
If you upgrade...oh, it exploded.

566
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:24,470
Nice.

567
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,250
If you upgrade the middle path for your balloon trap, you can trap the target.

568
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,190
The middle...

569
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,230
Like this one.

570
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,210
Well, that's what I'm working on.

571
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,870
We're gonna do these two.

572
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,730
What about this?

573
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,070
Oh, it'll be a lot though.

574
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,990
We're doing our best.

575
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:55,630
If I can upgrade these guys and then maybe if I have to restart before we get to level 200, it will still be OK maybe.

576
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,550
We'll see.

577
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,810
Yeah, no rush.

578
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,230
We're just vibing.

579
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:02,650
Nice!

580
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,150
We're just vibing.

581
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,010
You need to farm.

582
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,090
Oh my gosh, thank you!

583
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,430
I completely forgot about farming.

584
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,590
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

585
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,630
Let's put it...

586
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,330
Wait...

587
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,310
Who's good...

588
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,050
Was it him that's good around farms?

589
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,670
Who is good around farms?

590
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,540
I recommend unlocking everything and playing optimally at all times!

591
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,320
Druid.

592
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,260
Oh, so it is him.

593
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,980
OK, good, good, good.

594
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,660
So if I put him...

595
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,700
Maybe like here.

596
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,360
Here.

597
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,860
And then we can surround him with farms.

598
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,940
And his is this one, right?

599
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,560
And then farm.

601
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,620
Farm, baby, farm.

602
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,820
Farm.

603
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,620
Thank you for reminding me about the farm.

604
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,220
Farm.

605
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,500
Farm.

606
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,340
Farm.

607
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,840
Farm.

608
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,820
OK.

609
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,240
VTuber, why?

610
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,260
What am I doing?

611
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,120
What am I doing wrong?

612
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,240
Everything.

613
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,100
VTuber, you're just so bad at games.

614
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,250
It's hard being as bad as I am.

615
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,290
I'm bad to the bone.

616
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,410
I have no bones.

617
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,350
No bones about it.

618
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,350
Let's go with...

619
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,770
Bananers.

620
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,490
Yummy.

621
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,030
Roxas, thank you for two months in.

622
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,770
Sherry, welcome to membership.

623
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,470
Thank you.

624
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,410
Which would you guys say?

625
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,570
Maybe banana sentrero?

626
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,850
And then...

627
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,970
Wait, this one.

628
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,490
Collects income in radius.

629
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,330
Maybe this one in the middle.

630
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,450
Monkey Wall Street for this one.

631
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,490
And then this one...

632
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,190
The banana sentrero.

633
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,150
Right, maybe?

634
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,690
Bottom auto-collects.

635
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,550
Yeah, bottom auto-collects.

636
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,690
Give me more money.

637
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,600
Bottom is the buy and forget.

638
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,660
Top and middle require micro, but give slightly more money.

639
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,660
I don't mind just being like...

640
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,920
Oh my gosh, Joshua, our Bloons expert.

641
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,860
Thank you.

642
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,640
Thank you for the streaming.

643
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,480
Donated it today.

644
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,160
I'll borrow it.

645
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:17,820
I'll be okay.

646
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,060
Thank you for being here at the stream.

647
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,320
Tonight I will beat MGS1 for the first time.

648
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,940
I beat... I beat... I beat... I'm sorry.

649
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,360
I beat Vulcan Raven yesterday and got into the room with Metal Gear.

650
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,240
Vulcan Raven, you can do it!

651
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,180
Slimebunny, thanks for the membership.

652
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,700
Okay, farm 2-0-5 is best early game.

653
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,860
5-2-0 is mid game.

654
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Are we mid?

655
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,760
Am I mid?

656
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,720
2-5 is in late game.

657
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,420
The too big to fail?

658
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,760
The monkeynomics?

659
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,960
2-5-0 for farms.

660
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,990
Mid Minto.

661
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,750
Can't wait for Christopher Nolan's next film, Top Hat Minky Goes West.

662
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,030
Wait, I'm so confused.

663
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,330
Okay.

664
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,550
Sorry, brain very slow today.

665
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,810
So, we should do...

666
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,390
Maybe 5-2-0.

667
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,750
Let's just do 5 on this one.

668
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,750
Let's go 5.

669
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,630
And 2.

670
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,890
Increase the value, baby.

671
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,730
Increase the value.

672
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,170
More money, more money.

673
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,810
But also, let's...

674
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,760
Money, money, money.

675
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,640
Oh shoot.

676
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,320
I didn't notice what round we were on.

677
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,030
Everything is fine.

678
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,350
Everything is okay, guys.

679
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,090
Calm down, calm down.

680
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,930
Calm down, it's okay.

681
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,590
All good.

682
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,230
Yeah, not even close.

683
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:40,970
Don't

684
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,360
panic, don't panic.

685
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,720
We've got this.

686
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,680
I just need a lot more money.

687
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,280
Nice.

688
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,180
I'm like wondering...

689
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,400
I like to also put these guys, the gunner...

690
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,060
The gunner monkeys, like on the edges.

691
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,200
They're pretty good when they're like...

692
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,440
See, look at this placement.

693
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,320
Is that not so good?

694
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,500
Oh my god, he's so snug in there.

695
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,180
He's so good.

696
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,240
Need more sniper monkey.

697
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,860
Sniper monkey.

698
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,040
Is she a pro?

699
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,180
I am.

700
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,160
He's so cozy.

701
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,480
I kind of want to just place him in there because it's so perfect.

702
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:37,680
No?

703
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,080
I'm gonna.

704
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,720
I'm gonna put him in there.

705
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,800
I like to have him...

706
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,000
The ray of doom.

707
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,970
I don't know how...

708
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,550
Locked and loaded, baby.

709
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,730
There we go.

710
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,430
Need more bows.

711
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,570
I'm working on it.

712
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:05,650
I'm

713
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,910
working...

714
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,020
Sniper monkey.

715
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,800
Oh yeah, that's true.

716
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,520
The 250 sniper allows for farming.

717
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,120
So true.

718
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,660
We can have those guys.

719
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,240
I like to have my sniper monkeys on vacation.

720
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,620
So I like to put them on the...

721
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,920
On the mats.

722
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,060
What's it called?

723
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,680
Be damned.

724
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:34,800
Be damned.

725
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,420
Optimization, be damned.

726
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,980
Let's collect some more money a little bit.

727
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,100
So fast.

728
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,100
It's so fast, it's so scary.

729
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,060
Okay, I'm gonna do...

730
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,700
Like I said, I think I'm gonna do the top one.

731
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,370
Or should I do the more...

732
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,420
We can do another one.

733
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,960
My birthday was yesterday.

734
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,120
Thank you so much for the karaoke.

735
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,320
Otel, happy birthday!

736
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,580
Happy birthday to you.

737
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,100
Happy birthday to you.

738
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,220
Happy birthday dear Otel.

739
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,260
Happy birthday to you.

740
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,720
Happy birthday!

741
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Let's put in some sniper monkeys.

742
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,270
And we're gonna go with...

743
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,510
We'll go with this one and...

744
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,030
We'll go with one and two.

745
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,030
You will be this one.

746
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,010
Shrapnel.

747
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,870
You will be this one.

748
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,850
Give me more money.

749
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,830
I do need to upgrade my farm, so...

750
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,150
Let's start upgrading those.

751
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,110
Pro Minto gaming.

752
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,930
Welcome back Minto!

753
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,230
Yesterday was my friend NineLive's birthday.

754
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,630
Can I get a happy birthday from you for him?

755
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:26,810
Of course!

756
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,130
So many birthdays yesterday.

757
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,690
Happy birthday to you.

758
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,370
Happy birthday to you.

759
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,270
Happy birthday dear NineLive.

760
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,170
Happy birthday to you.

761
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,730
Happy birthday!

762
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,390
Which one are we doing for this one?

763
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,890
This one is obviously this one.

764
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,870
Maybe we do the increase.

765
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,090
More monkey.

766
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,310
I mean banana.

767
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,070
Oh my goodness.

768
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,870
So fast.

769
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,250
I also gotta upgrade this guy, but for right now he's okay.

770
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,150
Hope you enjoyed your vacation Minto.

771
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,970
I'm not gonna lie, I honestly enjoyed it so much like...

772
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,230
I kind of...

773
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,350
Actually sort of logged off.

774
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,550
Like when I was out and about and doing stuff for the first time...

775
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:29,190
I felt like I could really kind of turn my brain off and...

776
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,030
I really felt like I was actually like on a vacation.

777
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,950
I wasn't thinking about stuff so much.

778
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:37,970
It was really nice.

779
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,940
But now my brain is too off.

780
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,880
Now my brain is too off I think.

781
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,080
I'm gonna focus on upgrading these guys that we have, you know?

782
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,860
Because I know it's better to have a strong monkey than a lot monkey.

783
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,240
Did you remember to turn it on?

784
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,980
I don't know how to do it anymore.

785
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,040
Today is my unbirthday.

786
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,900
Happy unbirthday Blake!

787
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,620
He beat my super!

788
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,020
Happy birthday 9!

789
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,040
Happy birthday!

790
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,300
Yay!

791
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,140
Quality over quantity.

792
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,420
Exactly, exactly.

794
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,280
Perfect mental state for bloons.

795
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,440
I might drive some people crazy.

796
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,140
I apologize in advance.

797
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,460
Okay.

798
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,140
Okay.

799
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,660
We're getting some money.

800
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,900
But I still need... What's the second one here?

801
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,820
Nail gun and sentry shots do extra damage to MOAB.

802
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,680
That might be good.

803
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,720
And you... We can unlock this.

804
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,220
Okay, we're fine.

805
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,160
We're all good.

806
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,380
Wow, thank you for all the memberships!

807
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:26,820
What the heck?

808
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,200
Thank you guys!

809
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,780
Welcome back!

810
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,900
Welcome back, welcome back.

811
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,920
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

812
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,660
Welcome home.

813
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,320
Thank you!

814
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,040
Good foam cleanser.

815
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,480
Yeah.

816
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,160
Lots of green.

817
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,820
All of a sudden...

818
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,760
Green is a good color, no?

819
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,640
Green is the best color.

820
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,340
Maybe.

821
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,040
Minto green.

822
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,480
We can move the trap closer to the... Oh, you can?

823
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:53,980
Wait.

824
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,700
I did not click that.

825
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,040
My mouse is having issues.

826
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,900
Handle it.

827
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,180
MOAB.

828
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,480
Handle it.

829
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,060
Okay.

830
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,080
I really like the spirit of the forest, so I kind of want to save up for that, but...

831
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,540
Let's get the supply drop.

832
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,740
And then I also want to do this one.

833
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,090
Pranked by the exit button.

834
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,150
I know.

835
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,250
Goodness gracious.

836
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,830
The sounds are insane.

837
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,730
Huh?

838
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,330
Am I streamed in?

839
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,510
What happened?

840
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,390
YouTube failing.

841
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,810
It's not me, it must be YouTube.

842
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,800
Limicorn, thanks for the gifted!

843
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,780
Marco, thanks for the gifted!

844
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,120
Thank you so much!

845
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,300
Forgot I had one of these.

846
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:16,700
Hello, Mickey.

847
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,740
I think it's YouTube, because I don't see any... Usually if something is wrong on my end, it will be through OBS.

848
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,160
But nothing is wrong through OBS, so...

849
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:32,820
Uh-oh.

850
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,300
YouTube!

851
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:35,920
YouTube!

852
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,280
Oh, I forgot completely.

853
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,560
What do we want to upgrade this guy to?

854
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,240
Our last banana farm.

855
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,130
Big bobbly boondonkas.

856
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,570
I don't think that's an upgrade.

857
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,050
250.

858
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,820
250.

859
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,960
520.

860
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,080
Middle and top.

861
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,200
Please no spamming!

862
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,860
Please no spamming.

863
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,380
I think we're back.

864
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,380
I wonder what happened.

865
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,140
So strange, YouTube.

866
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,180
So funny.

867
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,220
I'm gonna go with...

868
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,960
Just make one of each.

869
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,680
I don't have a bottom path, I don't think.

870
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,320
Or wait, this one is...

871
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,480
Oh, this is my bottom path.

872
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,100
That's right.

873
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,560
I was gonna say, I do have a bottom path.

874
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,980
Maybe we do 520 then.

875
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,140
Or wait, this one is... Let's do the middle path.

876
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,080
Just give me more money, please.

877
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,360
More money, please!

878
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,320
More money, please.

879
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,020
Nice.

880
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,420
More money, please.

881
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:19,800
More money.

882
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,560
Oh, we're almost to the end of the round.

883
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,920
Very good.

884
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:40,950
Supply drop.

885
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:41,750
Thank you!

886
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,030
Thank you for reminding me.

887
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:44,910
This one too.

888
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,650
I gotta remember it.

889
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,410
Thank you, thank you.

890
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,630
Yes, please feel free to remind me about supply drop.

891
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:51,930
And such.

892
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:55,690
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

893
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,430
I recently replayed Rayman Origins.

894
00:50:59,250 --> 00:50:59,910
A refiller game.

895
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,850
It's an Xbox 360 PS3 game and Series XS can play it.

896
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,110
When I played it, I forgot the nymphs looked spicy.

897
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:10,330
Rayman.

898
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,450
I never played Rayman.

899
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:11,770
Rayman.

900
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,690
I think I always thought he was kind of ugly.

901
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,430
So I just never played it.

902
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,280
Rayman platformers are great, you know?

903
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,790
Sometimes I fall asleep to the sound of balloons popping.

904
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,450
Sounds like rain.

905
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:41,530
Good night.

906
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,050
Good night!

907
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,150
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the...

908
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:46,910
Thank you!

909
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,390
Get my money.

910
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,410
The trap is kind of insane.

911
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,710
Thank you so much for the...

912
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,370
What are we at?

913
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,630
Oh, our XP could be better.

914
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,090
We'll get there eventually.

915
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:07,070
One day.

916
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,110
One day, I suppose.

917
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,610
What was I going to do?

918
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,390
Oh, this is the banana plantation one.

919
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,830
What's this thing do?

920
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:19,910
Select a monkey.

921
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,330
I don't know what that just did.

922
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,750
Free play.

923
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,020
Check my bank.

924
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,840
Thank you.

925
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,520
Okay.

926
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,440
What did that do?

927
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,240
Time to ramp it up.

928
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,480
I'm scared.

929
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,460
What does this one do again?

930
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,920
Place bins.

931
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,780
Also increases foam effectiveness.

932
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,620
Let's do the foam effectiveness.

933
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
You are this one.

934
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,540
Okay.

935
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,440
I'm gonna start saving for Spirit of the Forest now.

936
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,520
Also so we can get more hearts, you know.

937
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,420
Mickey, I miss you.

938
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,760
Did you...

939
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,960
Were you obsessed with me or something?

940
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,360
You missed me, huh?

941
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,070
When I'm here, it almost feels like she's back from Japan.

942
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,390
She's probably out there holding hands with that yummy sensei.

943
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,770
I wish.

944
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,270
Goodness gracious.

945
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,350
Oh my gosh, so much money!

946
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,270
Holy money!

947
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,650
So much money!

948
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,630
We're gonna be able to give Spirit of the Forest soon.

949
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:08,890
We're scaling.

950
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,150
Holy money, money, money.

951
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,860
I need to make boats, huh?

952
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,380
I need to make my Merchantman.

953
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,430
It's not like I missed you or anything.

954
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,330
Yeah, yeah.

955
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,190
Yeah, yeah.

956
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,600
Get him, Minto.

957
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,300
As the least obsessed Wisp, I can safely say that I missed Minto.

958
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,940
You guys are so silly.

959
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,680
I still have this guy I need to upgrade.

960
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,980
He's just chilling here.

961
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,380
Oh,

962
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,440
we can get the Elite Sniper.

963
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,540
Let's just...

964
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,620
Yeah, let's just finish upgrading him.

965
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,460
Zero, zero, zero, Gunner Monkey.

966
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,200
He's the new meta.

967
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,260
Forget about Ice Monkey.

968
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,460
It's zero, zero, zero, Gunner Monkey now.

969
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,320
Forgotten in the cozy corner.

970
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,560
Yeah, we'll start doing this one.

971
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,180
There we go.

972
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,280
Oh, he's barreling now.

973
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,160
He's barreling now.

974
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,840
I pressed that.

975
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,700
Just keep on going.

976
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,660
I don't like to do the automatic.

977
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,780
Because I like to...

978
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,400
I like to stop and be like...

979
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,580
Do I need to upgrade stuff?

980
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,080
So sorry if you're like...

981
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,820
Please, just do the auto rounds.

982
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,380
I'm just... That's not really my play style.

983
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,540
In the bank, oh yeah.

984
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,680
Collect our money.

985
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:32,940
Okay.

986
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,530
Wait, what did I miss?

987
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,410
Misses a lot all on her own.

988
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:44,410
What are you talking about?

989
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,190
Missed disability.

990
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:47,390
What is happening?

991
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,920
Returned from my first ever Japan trip.

992
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,740
Only took the wrong train once.

993
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,280
Me too.

994
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,660
I also took the wrong train.

995
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,120
I did the Ayaman Cafe on the 10th.

996
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,600
And my friends took me to my first ever Mint Cafe in Akiba.

997
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,420
Wait, where did you go?

998
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,200
And they had a made mint too.

999
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,560
Oh, you went to At Home.

1000
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,200
It was the perfect Mito day.

1001
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,460
I'm guessing you went to At Home.

1002
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,240
Was I correct?

1003
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:26,600
Maybe.

1004
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,260
And big O's!

1005
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,300
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

1006
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,730
Thank you so much.

1007
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,510
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1008
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,310
Alright.

1009
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,410
Just a little bit more.

1010
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:46,490
Just a little bit more.

1011
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,950
What is this hoarding of cash?

1012
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,910
I'm saving up!

1013
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,170
Patience.

1014
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:55,690
Patience.

1015
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,470
Patience.

1016
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,750
My dear...

1017
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:00,270
Minky.

1018
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:03,890
There we go.

1019
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:04,830
Yay!

1020
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:06,670
Grow!

1021
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:08,510
Grow!

1022
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:08,930
Grow!

1023
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:12,530
Grow.

1024
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,130
Grow.

1025
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:13,990
Grow.

1026
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,750
Grow.

1027
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:15,590
Grow.

1028
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:16,270
Grow.

1029
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,670
Grow.

1030
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,010
Grow!

1031
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,170
Let's see.

1032
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,090
We'll upgrade the farms after.

1033
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:31,130
That's what we'll aim for now.

1034
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,460
Grow.

1035
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:35,900
Grow.

1036
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:35,960
Grow.

1037
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,160
You should try Ember Ward.

1038
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,920
It's a very similar playstyle.

1039
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,700
There's a certain upgrade you might recognize.

1040
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,660
What does that mean?

1041
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,740
New car fund deposit!

1042
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,820
Take us on a road trip.

1043
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,200
That'll be us tomorrow...

1044
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,320
when we play Keep Driving.

1045
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:00,860
Let's see.

1046
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,420
What do I want to also do for this guy?

1047
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,900
Maybe they'll do the shrapnel shot.

1048
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,370
We don't need it though.

1049
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,970
We'll do fast.

1050
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:17,350
Fast firing.

1051
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,490
Research.

1052
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,030
Come on.

1053
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:30,590
Nice.

1054
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,210
Shotgun!

1055
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:42,330
Ota!

1056
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,170
Thank you.

1057
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,280
And we'll upgrade the central market after.

1058
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,880
We can also upgrade the lawn.

1059
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:11,840
As I wait for the Shinkansen back to Tokyo from Osaka, the collab cafe hasn't ended yet.

1060
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,220
Has it?

1061
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:12,880
No!

1062
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,060
It ends Sunday.

1063
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,600
I didn't get a chance after Fest, but would love to stop by today or tomorrow.

1064
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,460
Yeah, it ends Sunday.

1065
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,460
I don't think probably the lines are as bad anymore.

1066
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,600
I'm not quite sure to be honest.

1067
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,950
If anybody is still in Japan.

1068
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,090
I think most people have left or are leaving.

1069
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,790
She's killing it.

1070
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,340
There we go.

1071
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,320
I got the spammer, don't worry.

1072
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,540
Let's collect this.

1073
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,460
Let's do this.

1074
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,900
And then...

1075
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,460
We'll work on the cripple MOAB.

1076
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,120
That will be our next thing that we do.

1077
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:44,710
Stay strong Minto!

1078
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:46,490
Thanks!

1079
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,130
I'm staying strong!

1080
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,250
I have a question.

1081
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,470
When these are like exploding, these little boxes, am I missing the money?

1082
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,390
If I don't hover over it?

1083
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:59,250
Or does it automatically...

1084
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,570
Does it automatically do it?

1085
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:03,750
Wait, I'm scared.

1086
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,430
I'm working on some things.

1087
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:11,890
What's happening?

1088
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,850
Oh, it's fighting something.

1089
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,970
What are they fighting?

1090
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:17,430
Oh!

1091
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:19,910
Oh, that's what they're fighting.

1092
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,450
It does auto-collect?

1093
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,070
Okay, good, good.

1094
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:24,630
Thank you.

1095
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,420
Kidai, thank you for 4 months!

1096
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:41,600
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 50 gifted.

1097
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,280
Thank you so much!

1098
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1099
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,840
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1100
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,380
What is going on today?

1101
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,340
I think Bloons honestly attracts like some kids.

1102
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,060
It just happens.

1103
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,640
You can ignore them.

1104
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,960
I'll take care of it.

1105
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,700
You guys don't have to worry about it.

1106
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,420
Just ignore it.

1107
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,140
Wait, this guy we need to...

1108
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:03,520
You!

1109
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,180
Cripple!

1110
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:04,800
There we go.

1111
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:05,640
Cripple Moab.

1112
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,180
There we go, there we go.

1113
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,580
It happens like every time I play Bloons.

1114
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,340
It's one of those types of games.

1115
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,400
Trial detected.

1116
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:24,560
Trial detected.

1117
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,240
Alright, this one we're gonna do the long.

1118
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,810
So far so good, huh?

1119
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:42,330
What is the one round before level 100 that really filters people?

1120
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:45,830
Which one is it?

1121
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:46,430
I don't remember.

1122
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:48,490
Hamster!

1123
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,190
Welcome to membership.

1124
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:49,950
Thank you!

1125
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:50,570
Thank you.

1126
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,970
It's my turn to play Bloons.

1127
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,230
96...

1128
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,850
Okay, I think I'm thinking of 96.

1129
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:00,850
The fortified DDTs.

1130
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,630
Are they?

1131
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:02,970
Maybe.

1132
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:04,770
It's Tuesday.

1133
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:07,210
Still had 100 plus people line up at 2 PM.

1134
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:08,990
Lines are not going away anytime soon.

1135
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,270
Someday Mint will realize how many people...

1136
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,270
I...

1137
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,530
It's a matter of...

1138
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,430
I just don't know how many people are in Japan.

1139
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,170
I don't know.

1140
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,950
You banned a child.

1141
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,270
Should we do some more engineer monkeys up here?

1142
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:32,250
Should we really just lay them all out here?

1143
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:36,650
Big ol' engineer monkey parade.

1144
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:41,750
250 spike factory is a good DDT.

1145
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,010
Really?

1146
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:47,990
I don't think I have mine upgraded.

1147
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,610
Wait, what was it?

1148
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,410
2...5...

1149
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,550
I think that's what I was working on before.

1150
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,310
You can tell.

1151
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,670
After you beat game mode, you only...

1152
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,610
Yeah, I know you only get the 30% XP.

1153
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:05,510
It's kinda stinky.

1154
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:13,550
There are approximately 124.5 million people in Japan.

1155
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,750
And probably like 10 of those people are my fans.

1156
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,430
So, yeah.

1157
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:22,890
Okay?

1158
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,030
Hermes spikes are better.

1159
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,490
We can do all of them.

1160
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,330
Oh, but I don't have that one unlocked.

1161
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:42,350
Might as well just put it out there and start having it farmed, no?

1162
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,440
Even if it's a little bit of XP.

1163
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,760
Every XP maybe will help.

1164
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,320
More XP?

1165
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:56,960
Maybe.

1166
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,520
What else?

1167
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,740
What else do we need to upgrade?

1168
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,540
This one, 115.

1169
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,680
70,000.

1170
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,580
100,000.

1171
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,220
We've got our sniper minkies.

1172
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,100
This one we can't upgrade.

1173
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,160
This one we can't upgrade.

1174
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,920
This one is also 75.

1175
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:17,740
75...

1176
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,940
Mink, you can count higher than 10?

1177
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,560
How do you know?

1178
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,220
How do you know my counting capabilities, huh?

1179
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,880
How would you know?

1180
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,160
What would you do if you became the most popular Vtuber one day?

1181
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,960
Like popular for one day?

1182
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,020
Okay.

1183
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,920
Same thing I'm doing now.

1184
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,180
Check out the XXL trap for engineer.

1185
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,160
This one.

1186
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,640
I don't have enough though.

1187
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:01,620
I can't.

1188
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,260
Huge balloon traps can trap some of the largest balloons.

1189
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,600
That sounds so awesome.

1190
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,160
I want to unlock it.

1191
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:10,960
Lampy, thanks for the gifted!

1192
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,220
Gifted!

1193
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,410
Okay, we're almost...

1194
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:24,610
If I became the most popular Vtuber for one day, I would play balloons.

1195
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,610
At Minecraft.

1196
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,210
Yeah, balloons at Minecraft!

1197
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,970
Wait, we're so close to being able to get to 75?

1198
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:39,850
Holy moly.

1199
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:41,190
Checks out.

1200
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,270
Yeah.

1201
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:43,930
Let's get a load.

1202
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,190
Okay, I have more money now.

1203
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,040
So far, not so bad.

1204
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:53,920
I'm gonna go to 90.

1205
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,400
Scary.

1206
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,300
Okay.

1207
01:07:59,420 --> 01:07:59,940
75.

1208
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,520
We might have enough for an ice monkey.

1209
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,500
We might have enough for an ice monkey.

1210
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:10,960
I don't know.

1211
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,200
Those guys are priceless.

1212
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,040
We shouldn't be putting a price on the ice monkey's head, no?

1213
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,580
Just enough.

1214
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:33,380
He's our last resort defense guy.

1215
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,420
He's crazy.

1216
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,760
Holy moly.

1217
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,380
I should start doing boats, huh?

1218
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,960
Maybe I should have done those a long time ago, actually.

1219
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,340
Holy cow.

1220
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,340
Wait, what was he at before?

1221
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,300
I just clicked on him.

1222
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,300
Now he's at 56,000.

1223
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,140
What are these guys at?

1224
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,280
He's so little!

1225
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,600
This engineer monkey.

1226
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,540
He has such little stuff.

1227
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,560
This one's at 73.

1228
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,240
Wait, this guy has been going this whole time, and this guy comes in and immediately gets... Holy cow.

1229
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,540
You'd expose more people to Metal Gear.

1230
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,280
Oh,

1231
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,620
I forgot about my bank!

1232
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,260
Oh my gosh, I forgot about my bank!

1233
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,100
No!

1234
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,360
The big laser is absolutely insane.

1235
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,760
It's not even letting anything pass.

1236
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:49,000
It popped almost 100,000 since we've upgraded it.

1237
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:49,820
That's insane.

1238
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,960
Since last round!

1239
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,460
Holy moly!

1240
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,960
The laser is so OP.

1241
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,820
Holy cow!

1242
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,240
Stealing all the kills for real.

1243
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,240
Let's go!

1244
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:11,560
Okay, I believe we'll definitely be able to get to level 100 at least.

1245
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,700
I'm still scared for level 200.

1246
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,880
But, let's see.

1247
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,320
Maybe we can do another one.

1248
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,820
It's crazy.

1249
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,440
What is this one?

1250
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,580
We'll do the monkey wall straight first before we do the other two.

1251
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:45,180
Not just because they're more expensive, but also just because I want it to auto-collect the stuff in the radius so I'm not constantly doing this.

1252
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,240
Popped 1% of monkey fanbase.

1253
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,810
It's so strong.

1254
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:02,070
It's actually just so strong.

1255
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:02,630
It's crazy.

1256
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,440
Holy cow!

1257
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,240
Auto-collect, baby.

1258
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:18,340
Woo!

1259
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,160
There we go.

1260
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,080
We'll be in a little bit of debt.

1261
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,600
That's fine.

1262
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:32,640
Get merchants.

1263
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,140
Yeah, let's start getting some merchant monkeys in here too.

1264
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,720
I said that like 50 rounds ago, didn't I?

1265
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,480
Thank you, Dante!

1266
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:42,840
Thank you for 5 months.

1267
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,100
Oh my gosh, speaking of Dante.

1268
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,320
The...

1269
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:48,840
The Devil May Cry anime trailer!

1270
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,920
I was like...

1271
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,800
Learner!

1272
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,200
I was so excited.

1273
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:06,590
Merchant.

1274
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,540
I still have to unlock this.

1275
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:19,040
The Navark of the Seas.

1276
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,080
What is a good...

1277
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,620
What is a good one for the other round though?

1278
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,380
Hotshot?

1279
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,420
Hotshot or doubleshot?

1280
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,180
Oh, yeah!

1281
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,220
Osaka!

1282
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:44,200
From Azumanga.

1283
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,160
I did see that.

1284
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,340
Middle?

1285
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,840
Okay, I believe you.

1286
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:51,740
Hotshot.

1287
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,680
I believe you.

1288
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,360
Thank you, guys.

1289
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:57,540
Nice.

1290
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,420
Let's keep going.

1291
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:04,260
Scary!

1292
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,440
Scary!

1293
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,120
Locksmith Wisp here.

1294
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,420
Most dealerships are stingy with keys nowadays.

1295
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,240
New or used car...

1296
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,660
The norm is only getting one key.

1297
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:18,120
Try not to let them rip you off and get charged another 300 to 400 dollars for a second key.

1298
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,060
Why so much?

1299
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,510
Cripple Moab Sniper feeling neglected.

1300
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,050
No!

1301
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,910
He's got a good amount of stuff going on.

1302
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,380
Check the bank.

1303
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,080
Thank you!

1304
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,140
So...

1305
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,700
What would I...

1306
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,740
What would I say?

1307
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,620
Oh, the sniper is strong.

1308
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,360
Yes, thank you.

1309
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,160
Okay, that's a good idea.

1310
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,600
Oh wait, what's elite?

1311
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,300
What's the difference between elite...

1312
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,960
I imagine elite is better, no?

1313
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,520
Than strong?

1314
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,020
Elite is strong until it gets to the end of the course.

1315
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,150
Mix of strong and first.

1316
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:30,010
If balloons get to the end, it switches to first.

1317
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:33,330
Oh...

1318
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,490
So maybe sniper...

1319
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:38,110
Cripple Moab sniper on strong and...

1320
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:42,190
This guy on elite.

1321
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:42,910
Maybe?

1322
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,110
Hot dog.

1323
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:47,650
Oh my goodness.

1324
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,190
Wait, Gary!

1325
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,090
You know...

1326
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:53,050
I think you sent the same message twice.

1327
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,050
It's just a little backed up, but I see your messages.

1328
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:56,090
Thank you!

1329
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:58,870
The donos are a little backed up.

1330
01:14:59,130 --> 01:14:59,990
Kyoki, thank you!

1331
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:05,730
Had your 24-7 karaoke stream on while working to keep you going from insane.

1332
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:07,870
Started watching the summer podcast as well.

1333
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,070
Thank you!

1334
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:11,890
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

1335
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,970
I made sure to wash all the dishes like you asked before you left.

1336
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,390
Had to use wisp tears.

1337
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:21,870
Oh, you had plenty of water then.

1338
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:22,930
I believe.

1339
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:28,070
I just realized what round we're on.

1340
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:31,830
Not...

1341
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:33,390
Even...

1342
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,030
Close.

1343
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,790
Not even close.

1344
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,890
Endless supply.

1345
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,350
I was waiting for so...

1346
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,210
Wait, I waited too long for a birthday greeting, but you went on break during my birthday.

1347
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,490
Is it too late to ask for one?

1348
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:45,950
No!

1349
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,910
Monika!

1350
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,110
I'm so sorry.

1351
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,350
I'm so sorry.

1352
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:54,990
Happy birthday to you.

1353
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,890
Happy birthday to you.

1354
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:01,030
Happy birthday dear Monika.

1355
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,350
Happy birthday to you.

1356
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:07,910
Happy birthday!

1357
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:10,670
This guy...

1358
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,670
Oh my gosh, he's actually...

1359
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,130
Insano style.

1360
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:16,430
What else should we add?

1361
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,030
I feel like we could...

1362
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:20,770
We could get some more monkeys now.

1363
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:22,270
Or maybe I should max these out.

1364
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,510
Let's max out the banks and then we'll...

1365
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,090
Oh, this too.

1366
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:26,510
There we go.

1367
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,560
Okay, next.

1368
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,500
Bananas.

1369
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,420
I like watching numbers go up.

1370
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,660
Have you checked the money?

1371
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,280
I have now.

1372
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:11,980
Do I like mint candy?

1373
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:12,480
I do!

1374
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:12,520
I do!

1375
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,340
I've worked in the auto industry for 11 years.

1376
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,940
All new cars come with two keys.

1377
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,880
I didn't get a new car.

1378
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,580
Well, the one I'm looking at is not a new car though.

1379
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,040
It's a used car.

1380
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,500
I didn't want to go so much money.

1381
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:37,940
So I didn't get a new.

1382
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,800
Thanks for the hotdogs, you guys!

1383
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,180
Thank you!

1384
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:43,580
Oh!

1385
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,500
Finished my first MGS.

1386
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,820
MGS3 on the 3DS!

1387
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,600
Oh my gosh, thank goodness for the laser.

1388
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,180
Thank goodness for the laser!

1389
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,020
So what does this one do again?

1390
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,000
I don't even remember.

1391
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,300
We're trying to get to 100,000.

1392
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,170
Yeah, the laser is kind of...

1393
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,450
This is like the perfect spot for the laser.

1394
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,730
I might do one on this side too.

1395
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:26,310
Maybe we do another...

1396
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:26,890
Gatling?

1397
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:28,290
Darling?

1398
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,150
Oh my gosh!

1399
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:31,630
Darling!

1400
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:33,250
Darling Gunner!

1401
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:36,170
We'll do...

1402
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,010
Upgraded to 6 barrel.

1403
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:43,570
Massively increased damage.

1404
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,070
Bloons are excluded from existence.

1405
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:48,970
Moab Destroyer.

1406
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:51,250
We could do a 3 of course.

1407
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:52,950
Obviously we could do one right here.

1408
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,430
One right here.

1409
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,230
Or one right here.

1410
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:58,270
Whatever we so choose.

1411
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,110
Which do you guys think?

1412
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:06,550
Row 2 or row 3?

1413
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:17,330
Top left pointing to entrance.

1414
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,110
We can't technically point to the entrance though.

1415
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,170
Unless like here?

1416
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:25,790
But it would be angled.

1417
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:26,970
2?

1418
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:28,410
Okay, we'll go with 2.

1419
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,700
A slight angle.

1420
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,800
Mad is an amazing tower.

1421
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,340
Is it?

1422
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,300
I'm scared though.

1423
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,160
Would this really work?

1424
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,980
Would this work?

1425
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,420
Does it?

1426
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,700
It does work?

1427
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:51,740
It does work.

1428
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,520
I'm trusting you guys a lot right now.

1429
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,400
Wait, did it lock there?

1430
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,520
Did it lock?

1431
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,800
Yes, it worked.

1432
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,940
Okay, 2.

1433
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,000
Trust?

1434
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:11,440
Okay.

1435
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:12,560
We're trusting!

1436
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:14,640
I went full loaded!

1437
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,880
I went full loaded.

1438
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,000
Which one should we do then also?

1439
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,440
Because I don't know this...

1440
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,980
This setup very well.

1441
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:24,600
250?

1442
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:25,280
Okay.

1443
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,040
Trust.

1444
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:27,500
Trust.

1445
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,400
Wow.

1446
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:45,570
I'm trusting!

1447
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:47,350
I'm trusting!

1448
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:48,470
I'm trusting!

1449
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:52,070
Aim it a bit above the path.

1450
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:52,370
Okay.

1451
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:54,750
Like here?

1452
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,310
Wait, not... I feel like that's too far.

1453
01:20:58,690 --> 01:20:59,230
Like there?

1454
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:03,250
Big bullets.

1455
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,200
They run into the wall.

1456
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,260
What's the goal for today?

1457
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,220
200!

1458
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,600
Okay, we're getting money, money.

1459
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,740
They're running into the wall.

1460
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,340
They're running into the wall.

1461
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,040
Collect.

1462
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,920
What did this do?

1463
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,340
We're getting money!

1464
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,440
We're so close to be able to do one of these.

1465
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,820
Monkeynomics or Banana Central.

1466
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,200
Either one.

1467
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,380
My bank?

1468
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,620
We're okay with the bank right now.

1469
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,960
It only has 300 dollars in it.

1470
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,000
But I could do more bank.

1471
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,040
Oh, oh, oh.

1472
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:19,820
I saw it.

1473
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,140
You guys saw it too, right?

1474
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,700
The perfect placement.

1475
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,220
The perfect...

1476
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:33,120
Oh!

1477
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,340
I got it.

1478
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,250
You spin it.

1479
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,730
What did you guys say That was a good end game.

1480
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:52,170
I assume this is end game though.

1481
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:53,310
I don't know.

1482
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:54,430
End game.

1483
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,150
What is end game in this game anyway?

1484
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:02,990
4-2

1485
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,360
You guys are the best.

1486
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,240
Thank you!

1487
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,120
Said no name in other streamers.

1488
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,580
So to rephrase my old super chat.

1489
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,380
Oh sorry, Influx.

1490
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,100
I didn't see it.

1491
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,460
Any plans to build Metal Gear Gunpla with other Bishoujo memes while in Japan?

1492
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,300
Well, I just got back from Japan.

1493
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,660
I'm not really thinking.

1494
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,820
I know when I'm going back to Japan next.

1495
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,560
But I don't want to think about it right now.

1496
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,780
Probably not.

1497
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,000
Because I don't know if anybody else likes...

1498
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,500
If anybody in Bishoujo likes Metal Gear.

1499
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,620
But also...

1500
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:59,020
I feel taking my kit to Japan would be quite big.

1501
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:04,450
Matara?

1502
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,190
Is she in Japan?

1503
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,750
Is Matara-Kan in Japan?

1504
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,200
Though I will be collabing with a Bishoujo member.

1505
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,220
Soon-ish.

1506
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:19,920
This month.

1507
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,400
That I have not collabed with before.

1508
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,100
I'm kind of really nervous about it.

1509
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,700
It's gonna be like a big group collab.

1510
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,500
That I was invited to.

1511
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,580
This month.

1512
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,880
Actually, I have so many collabs.

1513
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,000
This month.

1514
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,140
It just happened that way.

1515
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:42,540
Suddenly.

1516
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,760
Many big group collabs too and stuff.

1517
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,640
I was like...

1518
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,060
There's so much happening.

1519
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,400
Wait, hold on.

1520
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,660
Let me actually open Discord.

1521
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,940
Just in case.

1522
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,180
I have...

1523
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,620
There we go.

1524
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,570
Right now we'll stay as we are.

1525
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:16,710
Until I feel...

1526
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,990
Banana Central!

1527
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:21,450
Until I feel that we must...

1528
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,670
Create more monkeys.

1529
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,740
The DDTs are scaring me.

1530
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,200
The DDTs are scaring me.

1531
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,480
Maybe we create more monkeys.

1532
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:38,640
Monkey.

1533
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,380
What does this one...

1534
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,680
Isn't the Monkeynomics just gives you...

1535
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,300
It's not a loan.

1536
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:49,140
It just gives you money.

1537
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,460
Sentry 025.

1538
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,220
I actually don't think...

1539
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:54,400
Wait.

1540
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:55,980
Sentry is...

1541
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:56,940
Not engineer.

1542
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,260
Is it?

1543
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:00,300
No.

1544
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,920
Sentry 025.

1545
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,400
I can't do the 5 though.

1546
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:04,540
Look.

1547
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,440
It just gives you the 10k.

1548
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,300
Hope your trip was good, Mr. Minto.

1549
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,860
Thank you, Zornia.

1550
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,340
Thank you.

1551
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,700
I feel like I should...

1552
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,700
I feel like I should...

1553
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,780
Get another monkey and...

1554
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,020
Have it like...

1555
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,180
Full upgrade and all.

1556
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:29,440
Glue is good?

1557
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,360
Glue!

1558
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,000
Glue like right here maybe.

1559
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:34,080
Maybe.

1560
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:36,760
Right in the front.

1561
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,040
A pirate lord.

1562
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,980
We should do that too.

1563
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:41,260
Glue.

1564
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:42,720
Like a super glue.

1565
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,400
Alchemist.

1566
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:49,760
Okay.

1567
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,000
Let's focus on the glue monkey.

1568
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,260
Let's do the super glue.

1569
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,600
First and then we can do like...

1570
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,280
The pirate and the...

1571
01:26:59,280 --> 01:26:59,980
Nice.

1572
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,420
Bigger glob.

1573
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,900
I'm gonna do the bigger...

1574
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,800
025 probably, right?

1575
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,100
Yeah, 025.

1576
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:11,620
Thank you.

1577
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:18,900
I'm in Florida today and just picked up...

1578
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,620
37,593 pounds of orange juice.

1579
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,500
Bound for Pacific Northwest.

1580
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,260
Why do you have so much orange juice?

1581
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:30,480
What?

1582
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,020
Why do you have so much?

1583
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,940
You'll never get scurvy ever again.

1584
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,220
Oh my god, the glue is killing it.

1585
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:42,840
Yeah!

1586
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,260
Nice.

1587
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:57,520
May I have a glass?

1588
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,620
Oh, a truck driver.

1589
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,500
I thought...

1590
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,760
My initial thought was that you literally handpicked...

1591
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,660
That many...

1592
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:12,120
That amount of oranges...

1593
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,840
To create the orange juice.

1594
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,740
I was like...

1595
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,900
No way!

1596
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,020
How did you do that?

1597
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:21,960
Why?

1598
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,340
Do I have for alchemist monkey?

1599
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,540
That's wizard monkey.

1600
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,200
Alchemist monkey.

1601
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,680
What was it that someone suggested?

1602
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,460
I don't think I have enough...

1603
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,180
XP for the...

1604
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,220
For it though, maybe.

1605
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:39,960
Wait, hold on.

1606
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:40,960
I go up a little.

1607
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,120
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

1608
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,060
I'm looking for...

1609
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,440
Top is good.

1610
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,360
The permanent brew.

1611
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,780
Oh, this is the one that...

1612
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,000
Buffs the monkeys, right?

1613
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:57,300
520?

1614
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,700
Where would I place him though?

1615
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:03,540
What's up?

1616
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,380
He went to his bag.

1617
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,060
Thank you!

1618
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,320
Thank you so much!

1619
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:11,640
Thank you so much for the silver chat.

1620
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,320
I really appreciate it!

1621
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:17,420
Oh, dang it, I clicked it.

1622
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,760
I'm saving up money for the Monkeynomics, by the way.

1623
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,140
Next to Gloomonkey.

1624
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:24,560
Okay.

1625
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,780
Next to Gloomonkey.

1626
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:35,650
Do I still have to pay off this loan?

1627
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:36,930
If I upgrade?

1628
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:41,430
And... upgrade.

1629
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:42,410
Oh, I do.

1630
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:43,650
That's so rude.

1631
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:51,490
Biowm, biowm!

1632
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:54,490
Biowm, biowm!

1633
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,150
Biowm, biowm!

1634
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:02,590
I'm pulling out all the stops right now.

1635
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,070
Easy peasy.

1636
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:08,370
Oh, it's my superchat from Astro Bot.

1637
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:10,970
It was so long ago.

1638
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:13,850
Where your nervous laughter silently told us all...

1639
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:15,910
What are you talking about?

1640
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,430
Glad you enjoyed your Japan trip.

1641
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:22,950
I wanna make a point to go to Holo Expo next year.

1642
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:26,210
Side note, as a muscular man, which holo fam should I cosplay as?

1643
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,010
Anybody with their...

1644
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:34,350
I feel like Marien is a really good muscular cosplay to do, no?

1645
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,490
Actually, I got a picture with some of the muscular guys.

1646
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:43,310
Me and my friend group, they were like, we wanna get pics with the muscular men.

1647
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:52,870
But anyone that has their guns out, no?

1648
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,230
Looking forward to DMC4 and Peace Walker this week?

1649
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:59,030
Thank you!

1650
01:30:59,210 --> 01:30:59,730
Me too.

1651
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:02,250
I'm so excited for both.

1652
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:04,230
Okay, we're doing Alchemist.

1653
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:04,970
No, that's a wizard.

1654
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:06,350
Alchemist.

1655
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:11,540
Should I... Wait, what does...

1656
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:20,550
Target another tower to supercharge the attack.

1657
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,810
I don't think we should do that one.

1658
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:26,770
Oh, I should have moved this over, huh?

1659
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:27,930
I'm a dummy-dum.

1660
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:28,930
That's okay though.

1661
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:32,410
Mito stream during my work.

1662
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:33,890
It's not good work!

1663
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:39,810
I was gonna say, maybe I can sneak him here and then maybe another guy right there.

1664
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:42,630
So let's kind of optimize, optimize.

1665
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:47,530
Wait, actually, he should reach the other guys though, nevermind.

1666
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:48,930
Wait, cells?

1667
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:51,570
It's okay, we'll make that money back.

1668
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:54,430
He should reach the other guys, no?

1669
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:57,230
So it might be better to do here, right?

1670
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:06,260
Yes.

1671
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,220
I unironically started going to the gym because I wanted to do a buff Mint cosplay.

1672
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:22,400
I wanna see it!

1673
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:23,800
Mito games.

1674
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,420
I ran out of snack.

1675
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,080
Oh no!

1676
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:27,860
What are you gonna offer to me then?

1677
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:30,980
Going to Japan tomorrow for the first time.

1678
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,580
Planning to watch your Akiba tour on the plane.

1679
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,340
Any advice?

1680
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:33,880
Steer stage?

1681
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,600
Yes, steer stage.

1682
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,740
And you can go to the collab cafe.

1683
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:42,900
And...

1684
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,500
I made cafes.

1685
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,440
Whatever you want.

1686
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,940
Thank you!

1687
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:50,940
Thank you so much.

1688
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,340
Okay, so we're gonna place him right here.

1689
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:57,160
Yeah.

1690
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:58,380
Place you.

1691
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

1692
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,480
What would be better?

1693
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:05,840
Wait, it's 520, right?

1694
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,500
520.

1695
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:12,870
520, okay.

1696
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:14,490
Thank you!

1697
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,850
We're already at 120.

1698
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:29,950
Let's go.

1699
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:31,710
Okay.

1700
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:35,810
Pirate ship.

1701
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:39,610
Yo-ho, yo-ho.

1702
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:41,930
A pirate's life.

1703
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:44,610
We'll do more merchant ships too, so we can get more money.

1704
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:47,490
More money.

1705
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:03,390
It is so loud.

1706
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,090
I'm gonna turn it down a little bit.

1707
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:09,530
My ears are rumbling.

1708
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,440
What's a pet sound?

1709
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,080
Are there pets in this game?

1710
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:21,420
Ahoy!

1711
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,120
Oh, easy.

1712
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:24,560
Wait.

1713
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,440
What should be...

1714
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,060
What should be the others for the pirate lord?

1715
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:32,680
Sorry, I know I'm asking so many questions.

1716
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,180
It's just been so long since I've played.

1717
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,960
Oh, for the beast handler!

1718
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:42,940
That's right.

1719
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,740
I trust you.

1720
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:49,840
I trust you guys.

1721
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:51,220
I'm trusting you with my afterlife.

1722
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,680
Yo-ho, yo-ho.

1723
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,320
Pirate's life for me.

1724
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:07,220
Yo-ho, yo-ho.

1725
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:08,940
Pirate's life for me.

1726
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:16,310
Backseaters are thriving today.

1727
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:17,430
Hell yeah!

1728
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,990
It's your time to shine!

1729
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:25,030
Backseaters, rejoice!

1730
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:27,350
Bank check!

1731
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:29,510
That's 800 bucks.

1732
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:32,530
Meet those booties.

1733
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:36,690
You'll find my booties in one piece.

1734
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:39,010
Or something like that.

1735
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:41,110
I hope so.

1736
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:43,930
I sure hope my booty is in one piece.

1737
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:45,650
Oh gosh.

1738
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,240
Road work ahead.

1739
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,180
I sure hope it does.

1740
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:53,960
Yeah, look at this.

1741
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,000
We're not making anything.

1742
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,840
We're definitely not going to be able to upgrade those guys unfortunately.

1743
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:58,660
What about this one?

1744
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,440
Was it any close?

1745
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,300
This one might actually be able to get to the carpet of spikes.

1746
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:04,940
That would be insane.

1747
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,600
In a one piece swimsuit.

1748
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,680
It's all I have!

1749
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,740
All I have is a one piece swimsuit.

1750
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,580
Gosh, I have a lot of money.

1751
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:27,280
Keyboard mash.

1752
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,560
No keyboard mash!

1753
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,820
What should we do next you guys?

1754
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,460
Everything is fully maxed.

1755
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,920
That I can do.

1756
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:37,640
Right?

1757
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,640
Oh my gosh.

1758
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,240
We're...

1759
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:41,740
We're doing it!

1760
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:43,000
We're playing Bloons!

1761
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,640
Ice monkey.

1762
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,060
But he has to be 0, 0, 0.

1763
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,040
He's on vacation.

1764
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:01,050
He's on vacation.

1765
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:08,030
2, 0, 5 boomerang.

1766
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:10,770
I don't know if my boomerang is upgraded, is it?

1767
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:11,490
No.

1768
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,430
Wait.

1769
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,930
2, 0, 5.

1770
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:17,970
It could maybe...

1771
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:22,410
Why wouldn't it let me unlock?

1772
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:24,610
Oh, I have enough.

1773
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:25,590
2, 0, 5.

1774
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:26,090
Is that good?

1775
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,110
I don't think I've ever...

1776
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:29,490
I'll try it.

1777
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:29,930
Why not?

1778
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:30,870
We have enough.

1779
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:32,270
Let's do it.

1780
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:33,770
Why not?

1781
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:36,330
Why not?

1782
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,410
Where should I put... I'm gonna put him right here.

1783
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:42,550
Super monkey or monkey... Oh yeah, the plane.

1784
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:48,900
Wait.

1785
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:50,060
2, 0, 5 is alive.

1786
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,180
0, 2, 5 is what the...

1787
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:53,740
The hollies?

1788
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:54,540
What's the hollies?

1789
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,680
0, 2, 5.

1790
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,280
Oh, you can totally see that I literally had it set up for that.

1791
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,960
I do 0, 2, 5.

1792
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,980
Maybe the initial person meant that.

1793
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,120
And they got a little silly.

1794
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,940
I'm gonna put him right here.

1795
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,260
Nice and snug.

1796
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,860
0, 2, 5.

1797
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,800
Was that called a thang?

1798
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,320
Wait.

1799
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,180
Oh, rang.

1800
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,080
Oh my gosh.

1801
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,640
Boomerang monkey, swing on that thang.

1802
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,180
That's what I thought.

1803
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,460
Oh no.

1804
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:40,700
A bikini can be a one piece if you just don't wear half of it.

1805
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:00,390
The DDT made it pretty far.

1806
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:03,410
Into the... into here.

1807
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:04,650
It's kinda scary.

1808
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,730
Oh, and plane.

1809
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:11,790
Plane monkey.

1810
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:14,250
Is there any place I should put him?

1811
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:17,390
And then we were gonna... I could do...

1812
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:19,790
I could do any of them.

1813
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:21,330
I like plane monkey.

1814
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:31,540
You're a genius.

1815
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:34,560
I don't think so.

1816
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:35,560
I think if I did...

1817
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:40,680
I think if I wore my bathing suit in that particular way...

1818
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,720
I would go to jail.

1819
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:47,000
Ice monkey, that funky monkey.

1820
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,540
2, 0, 5.

1821
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,480
Plane is goaded.

1822
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:57,360
Put a 2, 5, 0 village next to snipers and put the plane next to the village.

1823
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,380
Wait, 0... Hold on.

1824
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,360
Village?

1825
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:03,600
What was it?

1826
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:04,040
0?

1827
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:08,840
2, 5, 0.

1828
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,120
Okay, let's try it.

1829
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,480
2, 5, 0.

1830
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:18,620
You guys have such knowledge.

1831
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,320
2...

1832
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:23,660
Wait.

1833
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,280
I messed up.

1834
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:26,540
Wait.

1835
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,220
No, I didn't.

1836
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:28,960
2, 5...

1837
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,440
2, 5...

1838
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,620
I thought I messed up for a second.

1839
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:41,360
And then the plane.

1840
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:42,460
Oh, I forgot about the plane.

1841
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:44,800
What's this do?

1842
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,400
These guys have...

1843
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,740
Sniper monkey is almost to a million.

1844
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,200
Sniper monkey is at a million.

1845
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,460
Big news.

1846
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,600
Plane 2, 0, 5.

1847
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,960
Plane 2, 0, 5.

1848
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:09,320
Plane.

1849
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:11,780
Like, right here.

1850
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:14,420
2...

1851
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:16,480
0, 5.

1852
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,640
Okay, I just need a little bit more money.

1853
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:23,960
But we are making bucks, baby.

1854
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,960
We're making money, baby.

1855
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,460
This is so exciting.

1856
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,240
We're a thriving business.

1857
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:39,310
Do you guys believe in...

1858
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:44,610
Do you believe in love after love?

1859
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:48,050
Do you believe we'll get to 200 today?

1860
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:53,590
Economy is booming.

1861
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,750
Bloons are booming.

1862
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:58,970
Donating to meet the bills.

1863
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:04,830
Only one way to find out.

1864
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:08,310
Let's not count our bananas before they drop.

1865
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:14,050
Look at this guy, though.

1866
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,560
200 is hard.

1867
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:19,480
I know I'm scared.

1868
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,000
I'm not gonna lie.

1869
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,900
Have I ever made it to 200 before?

1870
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:25,540
I can't quite remember.

1871
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:35,430
Navark is...

1872
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:36,650
200 stride.

1873
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:38,430
That's the one with the boats, right?

1874
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:41,570
Yeah, unfortunately I don't think we'll get there.

1875
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,070
But that's okay.

1876
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,540
But also... Hold on.

1877
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,220
I'm cooking right now.

1878
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:55,940
If I do a boat right here...

1879
01:42:55,940 --> 01:43:00,800
If I do the carrier right here, then we'll have more monkey...

1880
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,160
To be able to become Berserker Monkey.

1881
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:05,520
Right?

1882
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,060
But what would I put on top?

1883
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,660
What would fit on there?

1884
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,110
Ice monkey.

1885
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:31,330
No, he's on vacation.

1886
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:36,010
He doesn't need to lift... If this guy has lifted a finger...

1887
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:37,310
Okay, good.

1888
01:43:40,350 --> 01:43:42,590
He doesn't need to lift his little paw.

1889
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:49,970
Strawberry banana smoothie.

1890
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:50,450
Yummy!

1891
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:54,970
A cannon on the carrier.

1892
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:55,870
Wait, will it fit?

1893
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:59,510
I guess only one way to find out.

1894
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:02,610
It's top, right?

1895
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:08,510
I want it!

1896
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,350
I want it so bad.

1897
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:12,890
Oh my god, I can't even see anything.

1898
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:13,750
Wait, cannon.

1899
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,040
Bomb.

1900
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,040
Oh my god, it does fit!

1901
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:25,180
It does fit.

1902
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:27,260
Sir Simple Eye, thank you so much for the gifted!

1903
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,600
Thank you.

1904
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:35,160
My paws look like this so ice monkeys can look like that.

1905
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:37,800
502 bomb shooter, let's do it.

1906
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,040
Five...

1907
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:41,660
Oh no!

1908
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:42,600
Are you serious?

1909
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:43,740
I haven't...

1910
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45,380
Oh, I cannot... Oh no, I'm so close.

1911
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:46,880
I think we'll be able to get enough.

1912
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:48,100
502.

1913
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:56,340
I think we'll be able to get it eventually there.

1914
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,600
I'm so close.

1915
01:44:58,660 --> 01:44:59,860
Yeah, we're really, really close.

1916
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:05,900
I'm surprised because I feel like I use the bomb shooters a lot.

1917
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:08,040
Oh, it's the only one that I haven't.

1918
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,420
Oh, 520!

1919
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:21,060
Sorry, I have that thing where I read numbers wrong.

1920
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:27,720
I'll just sell it.

1921
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:28,520
We'll take the L.

1922
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,860
We'll take the L.

1923
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:31,580
It's okay.

1924
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:34,960
Five...

1925
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,680
What was it?

1926
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:40,740
520.

1927
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:41,980
520.

1928
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:42,440
Okay.

1929
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,320
We're gonna get there.

1930
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,240
I believe.

1931
01:45:58,340 --> 01:45:58,780
I trust.

1932
01:45:58,860 --> 01:45:59,180
I trust.

1933
01:45:59,260 --> 01:45:59,620
I trust.

1934
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:03,640
I trust.

1935
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:04,100
I trust.

1936
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:04,700
I trust.

1937
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:07,940
Minty-lexia.

1938
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:13,520
Give me money.

1939
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,040
Welcome to my mansion.

1940
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:17,780
Thank you!

1941
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:19,940
No super monkey?

1942
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,540
We could super monkey.

1943
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:24,660
That guy is fun.

1944
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,640
Why is it so slow?

1945
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,380
My mouse is acting so bizarre recently.

1946
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,440
Spam cannons for XP.

1947
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,920
For XP!

1948
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:42,680
For XP!

1949
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:47,760
Does it work in that every monkey on the whole stage gets the same XP?

1950
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:53,340
Or if I have more cannons... How does it work?

1951
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:59,630
Check the farm.

1952
01:46:59,730 --> 01:46:59,930
Thank you.

1953
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:07,970
Based on money spent.

1954
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:16,160
I know it barely matters in free play, but we're so close to this, I think we'll be able to get it.

1955
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:26,880
I know it reduces a ton in free play, but we're so close, I feel we could possibly get it.

1956
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,880
Whoa, that's so crazy.

1957
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:37,840
You just said that.

1958
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,940
Oh, winds of change.

1959
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:44,640
The tarot tapestry I won in your giveaway last month arrived last night.

1960
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,660
Now my very ghost can haunt my house!

1961
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,220
Thank you!

1962
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:51,080
Thank you!

1963
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,680
I want to use your hotdog donut sound as my phone notif.

1964
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,360
Do you ever plan on releasing those sound bites in an official way?

1965
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,420
I haven't thought about it.

1966
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,000
I never thought that people would want it.

1967
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:04,020
Give me money.

1968
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:04,920
Got it, boss.

1969
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:11,060
Maybe we'll just do some more bomb shooters then, huh?

1970
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,780
I'm just gonna put one here too.

1971
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,480
Why not?

1972
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,580
Why not?

1973
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,660
What should we do?

1974
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:24,200
I'm just gonna have him right there for now.

1975
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:26,500
He's just 0, 0, 0.

1976
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:28,540
Bomb, bomb.

1977
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,420
0, 5, 2.

1978
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,340
0, 5, 2.

1979
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:40,960
Wait, no.

1980
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:41,560
0, sorry.

1981
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,020
0, 2.

1982
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:43,720
Wait, I get so confused.

1983
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,420
Chatting from Osaka!

1984
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:53,180
Love the cafe.

1985
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,280
Thank you, KuriNinja!

1986
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:07,190
So this one is 5, 2.

1987
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:08,250
0.

1988
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:12,330
Oh, 2, 5, 0.

1989
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,890
Wait.

1990
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:18,750
2, 5.

1991
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,800
Alright, alright.

1992
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:26,680
We spent a lot of money on that one so we better get more XP.

1993
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:30,520
Come on.

1994
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:36,260
Come on, keep working, keep working.

1995
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,740
Keep shooting, keep shooting.

1996
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,020
Keep popping, keep ballooning.

1997
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,500
Come on, strong.

1998
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:45,760
Yeah, thank you.

1999
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,240
I always forget to do this.

2000
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,480
That I always forget to do the most.

2001
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:53,000
Keep popping, keep popping.

2002
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:55,200
Let's see.

2003
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,320
Yeah, the XP.

2004
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:57,760
Oh, see?

2005
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:59,280
It was at 60 before.

2006
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:00,580
We are so close.

2007
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,980
We are so close.

2008
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:03,660
We'll be able to get it for sure.

2009
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,480
We'll be able to get it for sure.

2010
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:06,240
In fact, I'm just gonna add another one.

2011
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,180
Like right...

2012
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:12,380
Right here.

2013
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,680
I can always tell it later.

2014
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,180
This one will be...

2015
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:23,320
0, 2, 5.

2016
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:24,820
Yeah.

2017
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:27,320
There we go.

2018
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:29,560
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

2019
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,660
Big bugs, big bugs, big bugs, big bugs.

2020
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:34,480
I mean, big bombs, big bombs, big bombs.

2021
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:36,240
This one also wants strong.

2022
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,820
You can find the correct build in the back of the CD case.

2023
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:43,900
Good.

2024
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,000
How do I say your name?

2025
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:49,280
Smiley, welcome to the bubble shop.

2026
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:49,620
Thank you.

2027
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,180
Yeah, I think I am winning so far, maybe.

2028
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,800
I think I am winning so far.

2029
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,340
Crazy how next month is gonna be the...

2030
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:05,540
Oh my gosh, soul smug.

2031
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:06,720
I was just thinking that.

2032
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:08,640
How next?

2033
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:10,480
Next?

2034
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:11,220
Next?

2035
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:13,500
Oh my gosh, like in just a couple weeks?

2036
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,340
In three weeks?

2037
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:18,740
In three weeks it will be a whole year since I came back.

2038
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:24,650
Isn't that so crazy?

2039
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:35,940
I got a knowledge point.

2040
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,820
Clearly only for in-game.

2041
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,300
Your boat doesn't have a grape shot.

2042
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,600
Oh, this one?

2043
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:46,140
Thank you.

2044
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:49,900
Thank you, thank you.

2045
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:51,440
Thank you, thank you.

2046
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,340
I'm also gonna do another merchant.

2047
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,140
I'm like, I'm gonna do another merchant.

2048
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,700
So much money.

2049
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:07,840
Maybe actually we'll do the super monkey finally.

2050
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:10,580
I don't think I have a lot upgraded for him.

2051
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,760
I don't have so much for him.

2052
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,300
I'm scared of the sun temple.

2053
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,980
Creed is a turtle.

2054
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,380
You could upgrade the last farm.

2055
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:28,860
This one?

2056
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:30,200
No, they're all maxed.

2057
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:30,360
No.

2058
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,840
They're all maxed.

2059
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,220
I mean, I could make another farm.

2060
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,620
The sun temple is scared of you?

2061
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:42,420
I don't think so.

2062
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:45,160
If it was scared of me, it wouldn't eat my monkey.

2063
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:49,280
2-5 for super monkey.

2064
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:52,240
I don't have 5 though.

2065
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,160
I have barely any XP.

2066
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,440
I think the reason I don't invest in super monkey is because he's so expensive.

2067
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,960
And so, I get him late game.

2068
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:09,420
And then by the time I get him late game, I don't have much time to get the experience and all.

2069
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:17,560
Banana central boosts 4-2-0 farms.

2070
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:18,000
Really?

2071
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:18,920
No way.

2072
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,240
4-2-0 farms.

2073
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:32,600
Right.

2074
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:35,920
Right.

2075
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:36,520
I saw it.

2076
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:39,980
Wait.

2077
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:43,260
There we go.

2078
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:53,000
4-4-2-0.

2079
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,060
Nice T-spin.

2080
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:04,790
This guy is fully maxed.

2081
01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:12,210
I want... I don't think I've ever made a paragon.

2082
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:13,410
Paragon.

2083
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:18,630
I don't think because I haven't... Never unlocked it.

2084
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:20,630
All my things are not high enough.

2085
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:22,670
This is like the closest one that we have.

2086
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:25,370
But even still, we'll definitely not get it.

2087
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:27,610
Paragon.

2088
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:28,190
Paragon.

2089
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:28,930
Paragon.

2090
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:30,630
I am...

2091
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:33,470
I am my brain.

2092
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:36,030
Dart.

2093
01:54:36,130 --> 01:54:36,690
Paragon.

2094
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:37,450
Pinky.

2095
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:38,070
Paragon.

2096
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:39,290
Bloom.

2097
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:40,090
Paragon.

2098
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:41,090
Bomb.

2099
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:41,810
Paragon.

2100
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:41,830
Paragon.

2101
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:48,350
Bloon Master Alchemist.

2102
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,130
Oh, that's Boomerang Minky.

2103
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:51,530
Wow, 2 million!

2104
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:56,690
See, I don't even have it all unlocked.

2105
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:03,030
You guys have such good advice and I just can't take it.

2106
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:03,590
I'm sorry.

2107
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:04,770
I can't do it.

2108
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:05,390
I'm useless.

2109
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,090
That's an EU VOD watcher.

2110
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:10,230
May I humbly ask...

2111
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:12,090
If you want to be my wife...

2112
01:55:14,130 --> 01:55:16,330
Whatever your answer is...

2113
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:17,890
Please keep being cringe and free.

2114
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:24,150
Smiley, I think you are also cringe and free.

2115
01:55:25,450 --> 01:55:28,530
I'll keep lurking as long as you exist.

2116
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:38,130
Maybe we should do like a world...

2117
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:38,970
World...

2118
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:41,270
World Wife Minto Day.

2119
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:45,370
Where just for one day I can be your wife.

2120
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:46,990
But I wouldn't be very good at that.

2121
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:48,950
I can't cook.

2122
01:55:49,690 --> 01:55:50,670
I can clean.

2123
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:55,570
I don't think you know what you are signing up for when you...

2124
01:55:55,570 --> 01:55:56,090
Oh my god.

2125
01:55:57,350 --> 01:55:59,010
Did we lose lives?

2126
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:00,750
That was so scary.

2127
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:02,690
Did we lose lives?

2128
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:16,770
That was so scary.

2129
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:26,130
There's a chance?

2130
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:27,190
Well, not really.

2131
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:34,570
Guys, I don't think a maid can become a wife.

2132
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:37,410
It's like in the maid code.

2133
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:44,480
What do we use 300k for?

2134
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,860
That's a great question.

2135
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:48,200
What should we...

2136
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:49,020
No thanks.

2137
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:51,120
I think we should see other people.

2138
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,820
Get out of here, Chovek.

2139
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,520
You wouldn't even want to.

2140
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,480
I wouldn't even want to.

2141
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,020
I'm rejecting you before you reject me.

2142
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,180
I'm not fired.

2143
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:03,800
I quit.

2144
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:09,580
World Wife Minto Day definitely checks out with the world...

2145
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:09,900
Wait.

2146
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:11,140
Widespread of urium.

2147
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:13,160
What happened?

2148
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,460
I leave and Tia gets a girlfriend.

2149
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:17,180
How did this happen?

2150
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:20,340
Why does something happen every time I leave?

2151
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,020
How did this happen?

2152
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:24,320
Tia, are you here?

2153
01:57:25,460 --> 01:57:26,200
What happened?

2154
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:33,210
It's because you missed the date.

2155
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,150
Doesn't that work out better then?

2156
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:47,540
What should we add, guys?

2157
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:48,940
What's the next thing we should do?

2158
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:53,720
Skip the date.

2159
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,380
Save the date?

2160
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,600
No, skip the date.

2161
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:00,900
What?

2162
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:01,540
Submarine.

2163
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:04,840
Get a temple.

2164
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,880
With the super monkey?

2165
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:08,960
The sun temple?

2166
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,400
No, it's so scary.

2167
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:16,120
If I go with submarine, submarines scare me.

2168
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:17,460
What else do they do?

2169
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:18,540
They buff, right?

2170
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:32,800
Submarine.

2171
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:35,740
I got

2172
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,040
two.

2173
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:43,360
Thank you.

2174
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:44,520
Hold on, I'll read it in a second.

2175
01:58:52,110 --> 01:58:53,930
Emma was a maid who became a wife.

2176
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:54,950
Anime can be real.

2177
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:55,350
Emma?

2178
01:58:57,970 --> 01:58:59,370
You're seeing other maids?

2179
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:03,050
Who's Emma?

2180
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:07,310
You're seeing other maids?

2181
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:08,910
Who's Emma?

2182
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:10,450
Who's Emma?

2183
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:11,610
Who's Emma?

2184
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:16,930
You're seeing other maids?

2185
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,220
Who's Emma?

2186
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:39,680
Who's Emma?

2187
01:59:40,770 --> 01:59:41,800
Another maid?

2188
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:58,130
Who's Emma?

2189
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,840
What's wrong with EE?

2190
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:06,020
EE.

2191
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:09,680
Are you the jealous type?

2192
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:12,020
Not even a little.

2193
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:22,780
Emma goes to another cafe minto in Canada.

2194
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:23,520
What?

2195
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,220
What were we doing?

2196
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:32,620
What were we doing?

2197
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:34,480
I'm not a simp.

2198
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,440
Are you saying Rem isn't wife material?

2199
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:39,120
Well, she's not married, is she?

2200
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:45,420
Okay.

2201
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:46,860
Temple?

2202
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:47,480
No!

2203
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:50,600
Two, five... Two, five, O, sub.

2204
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:51,700
Two, five, O, sub.

2205
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:00,600
Two, five.

2206
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,320
And also a temple.

2207
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:04,920
No!

2208
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:05,840
I don't want to do a temple!

2209
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:16,000
Top and middle path are both good.

2210
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,320
If we did the... Hold on.

2211
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,640
Why did I just place him there?

2212
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:22,880
Oh...

2213
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:32,560
I'll just do the top path.

2214
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:36,560
Okay.

2215
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,900
I'm getting a little nervous.

2216
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:51,780
I'm not gonna lie about our chances.

2217
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:54,860
I'm getting a little nervous.

2218
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:02,230
Five, O, two, sub.

2219
02:02:03,670 --> 02:02:04,090
What is that?

2220
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:05,710
Konbanwa, konbanwa.

2221
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:08,570
I'm gonna say you're a minky.

2222
02:02:08,890 --> 02:02:09,650
Oh my gosh, wait.

2223
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,770
Wait, you guys are at 11 months.

2224
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:14,550
Scary.

2225
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:21,050
What are we doing for one year back anyway?

2226
02:02:22,150 --> 02:02:22,990
I don't know!

2227
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:41,670
Wife day apparently.

2228
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:44,110
It's joke!

2229
02:02:44,250 --> 02:02:44,970
It's joke!

2230
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:48,350
It's joke!

2231
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:48,910
It's joke!

2232
02:02:48,990 --> 02:02:49,490
It's joke!

2233
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:56,010
I was just jerking it!

2234
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:15,130
What is...

2235
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:18,250
We will do a super monkey though.

2236
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:20,410
I will do him.

2237
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:21,210
Right.

2238
02:03:22,310 --> 02:03:23,410
Can he fit in here?

2239
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:25,050
Make room!

2240
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:27,150
Everybody get comfy and cozy.

2241
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:29,570
Maybe here?

2242
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:29,610
Here?

2243
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:39,270
What do you mean?

2244
02:03:39,430 --> 02:03:39,910
Do what?

2245
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:42,250
Place him.

2246
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:49,010
On the carrier?

2247
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:49,830
I have no room.

2248
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:54,190
I put the bombs there.

2249
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:55,510
Wait, oh wait.

2250
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:55,990
Let's check.

2251
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:01,830
Why has it like not gone up at all?

2252
02:04:03,410 --> 02:04:04,990
Remember it was at 600?

2253
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:07,870
Wait, why hasn't it gone up at all?

2254
02:04:11,170 --> 02:04:12,330
It has.

2255
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:13,790
The tiniest bit maybe.

2256
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:17,910
11 months is a typical gestation period for horses.

2257
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:23,150
Is that why they turn into glue?

2258
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:25,350
Because they have such sticky stomachs?

2259
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:34,900
Just jerking it because you can't be anyone's wife.

2260
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:37,300
My penis.

2261
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:38,240
No!

2262
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:44,580
That's why they make a good glue?

2263
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:45,500
Wait, seriously?

2264
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,680
They become...

2265
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:56,320
Because their stomachs are so sticky and just chase...

2266
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:01,940
...for 11 months and then they become glue.

2267
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:02,180
No.

2268
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:07,540
Probably.

2269
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:12,520
Someone said put this guy down here.

2270
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:15,440
But he's like so out of the way.

2271
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:20,580
Gestation is birth period?

2272
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:20,980
Oh!

2273
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,300
I thought that was...

2274
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:26,680
I'm thinking of...

2275
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:27,420
Is that

2276
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:37,120
not?

2277
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:37,720
Wait.

2278
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:47,470
I was like wow, the food stays in their stomach for 11 months.

2279
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:07,900
Bless your heart.

2280
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,920
Don't say that to me.

2281
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:09,640
I know.

2282
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:15,280
I know that when people in the south say bless your heart, they mean that you're stupid.

2283
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,520
3-2-0, super monkey.

2284
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:22,200
Okay, Todd Howard, I believe you.

2285
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,380
I'm gonna put him right here.

2286
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:24,100
We got a 3.

2287
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,320
2-0 him, baby.

2288
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:27,940
Let's go.

2289
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:30,880
Look at him, he's just chilling.

2290
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,880
Bless your heart.

2291
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:45,560
No temple.

2292
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:46,120
No temple.

2293
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:47,960
Temple too spooky.

2294
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,000
Never change.

2295
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:54,320
No, I should change.

2296
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:56,740
I should go to the bank right now.

2297
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:58,440
Get some change.

2298
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,480
I should.

2299
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:02,160
I should go back to school.

2300
02:07:11,610 --> 02:07:14,250
Let's just blame it on the jet lag, okay?

2301
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:17,350
Let's just say...

2302
02:07:18,290 --> 02:07:21,630
Jet lag is so crazy right now.

2303
02:07:23,710 --> 02:07:24,990
Never change.

2304
02:07:25,950 --> 02:07:30,350
It takes like 3 Paragons, 10 plus farms to beat round 200.

2305
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:31,490
Don't say that!

2306
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:31,590
What?

2307
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:33,330
No way.

2308
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:37,730
We're almost just 50 levels away.

2309
02:07:40,130 --> 02:07:40,970
MintoBrain404.

2310
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:50,770
MintoSAT, test stream, when?

2311
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:52,350
No, please.

2312
02:07:58,070 --> 02:08:00,070
Paragon, Paragon, Paragon.

2313
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:02,790
I don't have a single Paragon.

2314
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:05,490
How do you need so much money though?

2315
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:09,490
Am I not so rich already?

2316
02:08:13,330 --> 02:08:15,850
Maybe I'll do more...

2317
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:20,700
What else could I do more of?

2318
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:25,180
Oops, I tried clicking it.

2319
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:25,600
My bad.

2320
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:30,200
No, IceMinky's on vacation!

2321
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:31,660
We're not touching IceMinky!

2322
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:35,700
We're not touching him!

2323
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:37,720
He's on vacation.

2324
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:41,860
It's the third Gallant.

2325
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:42,500
Yeah, you know what?

2326
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:43,160
That's a good idea.

2327
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:44,480
We can put him right down here.

2328
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,320
To protect the IceMinky.

2329
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,680
Locked and loaded.

2330
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:55,100
And he will become...

2331
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:56,940
This is the second one, right?

2332
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:57,580
Yeah.

2333
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:00,080
So he'll become...

2334
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,200
Third.

2335
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:04,520
And also...

2336
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:07,300
Faster?

2337
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,500
How much pops for Sniper?

2338
02:09:12,860 --> 02:09:13,900
This one has a million.

2339
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:15,660
This one has two million.

2340
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:19,680
Wait, there's a third Sniper pathway that we can do also.

2341
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:20,880
I just realized.

2342
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:22,100
Let's do that too.

2343
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:24,120
Third Sniper.

2344
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:27,640
We'll put him right...

2345
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:36,840
Bottom.

2346
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:44,330
We'll do that one.

2347
02:09:45,410 --> 02:09:47,030
This guy looks insane.

2348
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:53,090
For this guy, which would it be?

2349
02:09:54,010 --> 02:09:54,530
205?

2350
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:55,470
Or is that for the Sniper?

2351
02:09:58,630 --> 02:10:02,290
I got to round 200 before without Paragon, so it is possible.

2352
02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:04,050
I also covered the map with monkeys.

2353
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:05,550
I had two Sun Temples.

2354
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:07,150
Oh.

2355
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:10,210
We're gonna have to...

2356
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:12,250
025 for this one.

2357
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:15,450
Let's go.

2358
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:19,410
I believe.

2359
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:20,050
I trust.

2360
02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:20,470
I trust.

2361
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:21,030
I trust.

2362
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:31,100
What's this one do again?

2363
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:33,320
I lost my mouse.

2364
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:36,260
Oh no!

2365
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:38,240
Thank goodness.

2366
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:44,020
Not a single finger lifted.

2367
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:48,120
Can you upgrade the Spike Factory?

2368
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:50,120
No.

2369
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:52,720
Unfortunately no.

2370
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:55,640
I don't think we'll be able to either.

2371
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:01,400
I'm trying to think of other ones that I have like fully unlocked, you know.

2372
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:03,320
There's the Tac.

2373
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:03,620
Shoot.

2374
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:04,460
No, nevermind.

2375
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,020
Not that one.

2376
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:10,860
We could do Dart Monkey.

2377
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:15,480
Top Path Druid.

2378
02:11:18,940 --> 02:11:21,240
Oh, the Super Storm is actually so good.

2379
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:26,380
Let's do that and we'll do it like... We'll do him right here.

2380
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:28,940
Or...

2381
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:33,260
I'm trying to think of what's a good place because he'll like start blowing them away, you know.

2382
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:35,800
The knockback is so good.

2383
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:38,660
In the village range?

2384
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:48,060
I feel like he's too far away though for like...

2385
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:51,000
Are there any rules for fan games?

2386
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:52,780
I wanted to make a visual novel about...

2387
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,620
Oh, for Game Jam!

2388
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:54,980
Your voice pack inspired me.

2389
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:55,620
Oh my gosh!

2390
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:57,960
No, I don't really have it.

2391
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,860
I mean, if you want to make a fan game, that'd be really cool.

2392
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:01,620
Thank you!

2393
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:07,700
Hold on, I also forgot to check my bank.

2394
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:08,600
Nice.

2395
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:10,220
Necromancer.

2396
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:11,860
Oh yes, we can get Necromancer Monkey.

2397
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:16,020
Yeah, we have these also.

2398
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:17,140
We do have these.

2399
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,060
And Phoenix Monkey.

2400
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:23,720
We have so many more that we can do to their full potential.

2401
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:29,060
So what I'm gonna do... So for the village...

2402
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:40,870
Let's...

2403
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:43,930
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking...

2404
02:12:43,930 --> 02:12:46,370
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking...

2405
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:47,550
I'm scared of the temple.

2406
02:12:48,750 --> 02:12:50,350
I've never used it before.

2407
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:55,070
Sacrifices enhance and modify the temple's attacks.

2408
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:57,090
Should we just do it?

2409
02:12:57,790 --> 02:12:59,170
Should I do it?

2410
02:13:00,090 --> 02:13:02,670
Who do I sacrifice?

2411
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:05,230
Get all the wizards.

2412
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:05,530
Okay.

2413
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:15,700
This message is endorsed by President George Sears.

2414
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:19,500
Oh my gosh, Solid Age.

2415
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,620
Thank you for 5 months.

2416
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:26,460
Wow, my president is in the chat.

2417
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:30,920
If you do more druids, put them together.

2418
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:32,160
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, right?

2419
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:33,480
Because they enhance each other, no?

2420
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:37,780
I'm gonna put this guy here.

2421
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:44,000
And I could always put a village there.

2422
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,260
And we also have this guy.

2423
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,020
The more bloons there are, the more damage it does.

2424
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:51,340
Let's just upgrade this guy for right now.

2425
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:57,000
And we'll do...

2426
02:13:58,360 --> 02:13:59,360
A heart of oak.

2427
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,520
And wrath can also...

2428
02:14:10,210 --> 02:14:10,770
Ah...

2429
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:21,060
Rune recommend making a temple from a fresh 300 super.

2430
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:23,580
Don't use one with range boost.

2431
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:24,840
Ah, he's gonna eat stuff.

2432
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:28,000
So, I was gonna ask too, because...

2433
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:32,440
So, everything that the light touches...

2434
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:33,280
He would eat?

2435
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:38,760
Because I was gonna say, do you select what you want sacrificed?

2436
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:43,040
Ah, I see, I see, I see, I see.

2437
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:46,900
I see, I see, I see, I see.

2438
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:49,120
What's poplust?

2439
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:00,940
Oh, oh!

2440
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,320
Okay, hold on.

2441
02:15:03,020 --> 02:15:04,000
We're gonna try this.

2442
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:06,680
We're gonna add a couple.

2443
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:10,340
So, this guy is gonna go right here.

2444
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,460
This guy is gonna go right... We're gonna surround them.

2445
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:16,120
They're gonna have a little party.

2446
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:17,460
Druid party!

2447
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:20,240
This guy can breach him, right?

2448
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,340
Oh, these are wizards.

2449
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm an idiot.

2450
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:24,960
Sorry, hold on.

2451
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:27,060
Being sold!

2452
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:28,160
Sell the monkeys!

2453
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:29,680
My bad, those are wizards.

2454
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:34,480
Okay, redo this guy right here.

2455
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,460
Redo this guy right here.

2456
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:42,540
I was just kidding.

2457
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,780
Okay, now this guy becomes a wrath.

2458
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:54,780
Wait, he will reach, right?

2459
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:55,660
Oh, yeah!

2460
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:58,580
Big wrath.

2461
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,600
Wrath, wrath, wrath.

2462
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:04,940
Poplust, poplust.

2463
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:11,120
Okay, now everything the light touches becomes...

2464
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:14,300
Ice monkey is down here, he's having a vacation.

2465
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:22,120
This thing looks like the... What are the guys in...

2466
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:24,400
Doctor Who.

2467
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,760
Hit five poplusts?

2468
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:30,140
Really?

2469
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:33,640
Oh my gosh, such a lust for revenge.

2470
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:39,720
Can they be anywhere?

2471
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:45,540
Daylick.

2472
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:46,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2473
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:54,120
Let's just try it.

2474
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:56,000
Wait, what did I just do?

2475
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,220
It needs to be extra range.

2476
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:58,500
They are though.

2477
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:01,400
They are as far as they can go.

2478
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:02,700
Daylick.

2479
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,200
Yeah, that thing.

2480
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:22,780
Oh yeah, oh yeah baby, oh yeah baby, oh yeah baby.

2481
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:25,160
I can't see anything.

2482
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:28,160
Oh yeah baby, oh yeah baby, oh yeah baby.

2483
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:29,720
Oh yeah.

2484
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:32,960
Dalick.

2485
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:34,840
Dalick.

2486
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:42,710
I didn't even think about the other things for these though.

2487
02:17:49,450 --> 02:17:52,150
I guess we'll just...

2488
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:55,330
We'll just enter.

2489
02:17:58,510 --> 02:17:59,190
There we go.

2490
02:18:00,070 --> 02:18:00,530
Good enough.

2491
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,120
Can you build a popping homie?

2492
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:17,810
Oh, I missed my chance.

2493
02:18:17,930 --> 02:18:18,750
Why did I use that?

2494
02:18:20,410 --> 02:18:21,270
Ice monkey?

2495
02:18:21,490 --> 02:18:21,930
He's chilling.

2496
02:18:22,970 --> 02:18:24,930
I want him to never lift a finger.

2497
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:30,070
Popping homie.

2498
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:31,890
What's popping homie?

2499
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:42,780
Nothing much, what's popping with you?

2500
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:49,430
Tommy!

2501
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:53,530
Necromancer.

2502
02:18:53,650 --> 02:18:57,250
He'll be good around down here probably, no?

2503
02:18:59,230 --> 02:18:59,970
Necromancer.

2504
02:19:01,190 --> 02:19:02,550
Summon the minkies.

2505
02:19:03,450 --> 02:19:05,870
Summon minkie, summon minkie, summon minkie.

2506
02:19:07,170 --> 02:19:09,990
Summon minkie, summon minkie.

2507
02:19:10,550 --> 02:19:12,250
Wait, where can I place it?

2508
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:13,550
Right there?

2509
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:20,330
What is a necromancer?

2510
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:21,430
205?

2511
02:19:23,010 --> 02:19:24,190
Say no more.

2512
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:26,610
Say no more.

2513
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:27,850
I believe you.

2514
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:49,800
No more.

2515
02:19:54,040 --> 02:19:55,180
He should be close to the front.

2516
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:56,060
Oh, should he?

2517
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:57,680
Oops.

2518
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,960
Oh, I can't make another one.

2519
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:04,400
I like your laugh so much.

2520
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:10,900
For some reason, have you guys seen that video of Justin Bieber in an interview?

2521
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:12,940
And the lady laughs.

2522
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:15,740
And he's like, I like that laugh.

2523
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:21,400
I like that laugh.

2524
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:25,580
I thought you were...

2525
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:29,380
I thought you were referencing that.

2526
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:31,140
I was like, oh no, you have a...

2527
02:20:31,140 --> 02:20:32,000
It's so funny.

2528
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:36,220
I get a lot of comments though from people being like, gosh, her laugh is so annoying.

2529
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:40,500
Sorry.

2530
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:45,660
Handle it.

2531
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:01,920
Annoyingly cute laugh.

2532
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:06,460
I think it's because sometimes I...

2533
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:10,640
Sometimes I, like, I get too into it.

2534
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:16,180
I get too into it maybe.

2535
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:18,460
It becomes a gross laugh.

2536
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:19,620
It's okay.

2537
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:21,280
It doesn't hurt my feelings or anything.

2538
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:24,920
There's a lot of people that also think my voice is annoying, so...

2539
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,260
But it doesn't hurt my feelings or anything.

2540
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:29,100
I just see the comments, you know.

2541
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:32,060
What

2542
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:37,740
do you think for the bitrate?

2543
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:40,160
Is it like craziness right now?

2544
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:43,900
Is it like craziness bitrate right now?

2545
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:47,900
Quinn, welcome to membership.

2546
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:48,660
Thank you.

2547
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:55,610
It's dying?

2548
02:21:55,890 --> 02:21:56,810
Oh no.

2549
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,110
It's starting to die for me a little.

2550
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:02,890
Oh gosh.

2551
02:22:03,430 --> 02:22:06,230
Oh gosh, do you think we'll be able to get the mermonkey after this?

2552
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:07,670
I sure hope so.

2553
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:20,000
I love your laugh so much.

2554
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:22,540
It's cute and definitely funny to see how easily amused you are.

2555
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:25,580
Oh my gosh, I brought this up the other day too.

2556
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:28,120
With some friends when I was in Japan.

2557
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:30,540
Sometimes, like, I just laugh at everything.

2558
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:34,660
And sometimes I get comments from people being like, why is she laughing so much?

2559
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:36,580
What did she take?

2560
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:37,400
What's wrong with her?

2561
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:38,420
Why is she always laughing?

2562
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:41,980
I just think everything is so silly.

2563
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:43,080
I can't help it.

2564
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:47,320
I'm just... I'm just always laughing at stuff.

2565
02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:50,100
Everything is so silly and fun.

2566
02:22:56,780 --> 02:22:58,660
I like to laugh.

2567
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:04,680
Can we get a nice monkey?

2568
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:07,860
Nice monkey.

2569
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:17,760
Nice monkey.

2570
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:20,600
Are you cracking up?

2571
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:24,420
I'm really looking forward to cracking up.

2572
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:28,280
That frog bird laugh is my rage tone the whole way.

2573
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:29,700
That's the worst.

2574
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:36,120
The only time I've gotten a comment on a clip of calling you annoying, I went to their channel.

2575
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:38,000
You were stalking them.

2576
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:41,440
They were stalking them.

2577
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:44,620
I went to their channel and they were 12 years old and posted Roblox videos.

2578
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:47,920
That's Barry.

2579
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:51,120
That's Barry's account actually.

2580
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:54,020
That's so funny though.

2581
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:58,120
Maybe the 12 year olds would think I'm annoying, huh?

2582
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:02,840
Oh,

2583
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:11,560
Barry catching strays.

2584
02:24:16,570 --> 02:24:18,110
Wow, wow.

2585
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:20,310
It's starting to lag a little bit.

2586
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:24,450
Gosh, this round is long.

2587
02:24:25,370 --> 02:24:25,970
160!

2588
02:24:27,930 --> 02:24:30,830
One of my favorite Minto laughs is the two more balls.

2589
02:24:32,570 --> 02:24:38,670
Speaking of the crane game, literally my Metal Gear Tumblers arrived today.

2590
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:40,850
I got them.

2591
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:43,430
They finally came.

2592
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:47,390
They're a little bit smaller than I expected, but they're a good size.

2593
02:24:48,050 --> 02:24:51,090
They're a really good size for cold drinks, I think.

2594
02:24:53,270 --> 02:24:54,970
I will be using them.

2595
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:57,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2596
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:59,590
They actually arrived just today.

2597
02:25:00,310 --> 02:25:01,130
Good timing.

2598
02:25:03,290 --> 02:25:04,970
Two more balls.

2599
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:07,230
Were they worth the money?

2600
02:25:07,370 --> 02:25:09,210
They're very cute, I'm not gonna lie.

2601
02:25:09,210 --> 02:25:11,150
They're really, really cute.

2602
02:25:11,570 --> 02:25:13,230
So I am quite pleased with them.

2603
02:25:14,190 --> 02:25:15,690
Should we do any Ninja Monkey?

2604
02:25:17,810 --> 02:25:20,110
Let's do a Master Bomber.

2605
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:22,670
What he would be...

2606
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:25,550
Master Bomber right here.

2607
02:25:26,670 --> 02:25:27,090
Nice.

2608
02:25:27,630 --> 02:25:30,070
Wait, if a Ninja Monkey, what is a good second?

2609
02:25:31,070 --> 02:25:31,630
205?

2610
02:25:31,730 --> 02:25:33,650
Alright, Huey, I'm trusting you right now.

2611
02:25:33,650 --> 02:25:35,410
My birthday was on the second.

2612
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:38,450
I couldn't get a birthday soup then, so I'm doing it now.

2613
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:38,910
Sky!

2614
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:40,490
Oh my goodness, my voice.

2615
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:40,790
Sorry.

2616
02:25:41,830 --> 02:25:43,030
Sky, happy birthday!

2617
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:48,170
Happy birthday to you.

2618
02:25:48,710 --> 02:25:51,090
Happy birthday to you.

2619
02:25:51,690 --> 02:25:54,050
Happy birthday, dear Sky.

2620
02:25:56,090 --> 02:25:58,870
Happy birthday to you.

2621
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:01,710
Happy birthday!

2622
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:07,830
I was honestly really hoping that me taking a break would...

2623
02:26:07,830 --> 02:26:12,570
Like, you know, going to Japan would help repair my voice a little bit.

2624
02:26:14,510 --> 02:26:19,810
But as you can tell, it's still a little rough sometimes.

2625
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:26,170
I wonder... I was thinking, I was like, I feel like I would have to take off like a whole month or something.

2626
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:30,370
To fix it.

2627
02:26:31,870 --> 02:26:33,750
But obviously I don't want to do that.

2628
02:26:34,050 --> 02:26:38,710
But I feel like if I went to a doctor, they would be like, Missy, you gotta take off a whole month.

2629
02:26:40,490 --> 02:26:42,990
You gotta stop talking for a while now.

2630
02:26:44,150 --> 02:26:45,670
You're gonna lose it.

2631
02:26:45,730 --> 02:26:46,710
You're gonna make lose it.

2632
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:49,190
You need to take off a whole month.

2633
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,500
I wonder what this guy's at.

2634
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:00,160
4 million!

2635
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:04,880
You gotta stop yapping.

2636
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:08,220
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like he would say that.

2637
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:15,690
They'd say it just like that too.

2638
02:27:15,890 --> 02:27:16,650
They would!

2639
02:27:18,770 --> 02:27:20,830
Better you take a month off than having to quit forever.

2640
02:27:21,350 --> 02:27:22,870
I felt it really bad yesterday.

2641
02:27:24,030 --> 02:27:24,870
During karaoke.

2642
02:27:25,910 --> 02:27:28,070
Usually it's not that my throat hurts.

2643
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:32,490
But lately it has been hurting a little bit.

2644
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:35,990
Obviously I don't want to take off a month.

2645
02:27:36,930 --> 02:27:38,890
I just can't help...

2646
02:27:38,890 --> 02:27:40,930
I can't help how I am.

2647
02:27:40,970 --> 02:27:43,270
So I get excitable and then I yell.

2648
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:44,150
And I'm sorry.

2649
02:27:45,570 --> 02:27:47,770
I get excitable and I'm like, Woo!

2650
02:27:48,410 --> 02:27:49,430
And I yell.

2651
02:27:51,050 --> 02:27:52,690
But I really need to take it easy.

2652
02:27:54,750 --> 02:27:56,110
Uh oh, I think my chat broke.

2653
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:56,530
Hold on.

2654
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:01,880
Well after this round I'll fix it.

2655
02:28:06,390 --> 02:28:08,410
I'll bring you guys back to life for me.

2656
02:28:11,830 --> 02:28:14,510
But it's been something on my mind for quite a bit.

2657
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:16,010
Not gonna lie.

2658
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:18,210
It's been on my mind like...

2659
02:28:19,830 --> 02:28:20,850
What do I do?

2660
02:28:23,030 --> 02:28:24,510
I was never...

2661
02:28:24,510 --> 02:28:27,030
You know a lot of Vtubers have this issue, right?

2662
02:28:27,130 --> 02:28:30,990
And then finally it's hitting me too.

2663
02:28:31,770 --> 02:28:34,530
Pop to us, sabotage that thing.

2664
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:44,920
But we'll see.

2665
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:50,480
Yell more to develop charming rasp.

2666
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:51,240
No!

2667
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:58,130
But yeah, maybe I should go to a doctor.

2668
02:28:58,690 --> 02:29:02,310
I think they really will just say, Stop yapping for a bit.

2669
02:29:03,010 --> 02:29:04,090
What else would they do?

2670
02:29:06,330 --> 02:29:08,450
What else would they tell me to do, you know?

2671
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:10,850
The DDTs are so scary.

2672
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:14,850
I can't see anything that's going on.

2673
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:25,600
No more crash outs.

2674
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:27,060
Doctor's orders.

2675
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:28,780
I know!

2676
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:32,240
I've crashed one too many times.

2677
02:29:32,580 --> 02:29:35,540
I've crashed out, I've outed one too many crashes.

2678
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:39,480
I don't know what else they would tell you.

2679
02:29:39,560 --> 02:29:42,680
Maybe if you ask the doctor they'd know what...

2680
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:46,180
Maybe if you stopped being such a smartass.

2681
02:29:51,970 --> 02:29:53,250
Okay, 164.

2682
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:00,400
Oh shoot.

2683
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:05,260
I think I have a meeting in 30 minutes.

2684
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:06,380
Wait, hold on.

2685
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:09,560
Uh oh.

2686
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:13,360
Uh oh, I think I forgot.

2687
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:21,520
But we're around 200.

2688
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:25,980
Think about it, if you don't do something about it, you're going to sound like Mata.

2689
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:26,640
No!

2690
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:28,200
That'd be the worst.

2691
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:30,760
Actually, some people would probably be like punching the air.

2692
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,380
She sounds like Mata.

2693
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:34,580
She sounds like a mommy.

2694
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:36,760
Okay, let's go.

2695
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:39,340
What if we do another plane?

2696
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:43,240
We have like the Sky Shredder.

2697
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:44,440
Let's do that one.

2698
02:30:45,420 --> 02:30:46,540
We're Sky Shredding.

2699
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:49,360
And I also have a helicopter.

2700
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:50,680
Oh my gosh, I completely forgot.

2701
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:06,180
Let's do...

2702
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:09,840
205 is only good for...

2703
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,960
Oh wait, that's what I have.

2704
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:17,440
Oh, Heli 502 is good in MOAB show.

2705
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:20,360
Okay, so we'll do Heli.

2706
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:23,000
Oh, that's not that.

2707
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:25,620
Come here, you.

2708
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:28,420
Helicopter.

2709
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:30,140
Helicopter.

2710
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:31,280
What was it?

2711
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:32,400
502?

2712
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,260
502.

2713
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:40,570
PS3 or Xbox?

2714
02:31:40,810 --> 02:31:41,730
I think Xbox.

2715
02:31:43,450 --> 02:31:46,070
I'm thinking Xbox, probably.

2716
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:55,480
Because last time I did it on PS3.

2717
02:31:56,400 --> 02:32:00,180
Xbox, you can still buy the game on the store, you know.

2718
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:03,300
So...

2719
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:04,820
I'm thinking...

2720
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:05,880
Xbox.

2721
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:12,720
Bitrate Shredder.

2722
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:14,160
I'm sorry!

2723
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:24,780
Even I can't tell what's going on.

2724
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:26,880
It's like lagging hardcore too.

2725
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:30,960
It's lagging so hard.

2726
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:36,580
What do I look like right now?

2727
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:40,940
There we go.

2728
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:41,620
That's better, no?

2729
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:44,800
I'll protect you!

2730
02:32:45,100 --> 02:32:46,740
I'll protect you from the bitrate.

2731
02:32:51,070 --> 02:32:52,470
The balloons are popping.

2732
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:54,230
The balloons are popping.

2733
02:32:54,890 --> 02:32:56,010
The balloons are popping.

2734
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:57,730
The balloons are popping.

2735
02:33:06,310 --> 02:33:08,890
There's lots of balloons happening right now.

2736
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,040
Nothing else is happening.

2737
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:24,820
It's kind of boring.

2738
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,860
Stonks are up.

2739
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:36,510
And such.

2740
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:42,010
Look into my eyes, Minto.

2741
02:33:42,610 --> 02:33:44,010
No, you look into my eyes.

2742
02:33:45,850 --> 02:33:47,250
Are you gonna watch the DMC anime?

2743
02:33:47,330 --> 02:33:49,110
Not the Netflix one too, after finishing 4?

2744
02:33:50,830 --> 02:33:51,390
Maybe.

2745
02:33:52,170 --> 02:33:55,150
I might wait until I finish the series though.

2746
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:02,520
If bunny girl, why no opai?

2747
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:05,220
Because not all girls have big opai.

2748
02:34:06,260 --> 02:34:07,260
That's okay.

2749
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:23,530
Send out the guns!

2750
02:34:23,530 --> 02:34:23,730
Guns!

2751
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:32,280
Send out the guns!

2752
02:34:37,160 --> 02:34:39,220
Oh my god, the game is freezing.

2753
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:44,420
Oh my god, the game is freezing real.

2754
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:45,860
My screen!

2755
02:34:48,260 --> 02:34:49,380
My screen!

2756
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:54,500
Is there anything that I can upgrade?

2757
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:55,740
Oh, this one.

2758
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:56,500
Let's see.

2759
02:35:01,460 --> 02:35:03,460
I don't think this one matters very much.

2760
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:04,720
We'll do the exploding I suppose.

2761
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:07,040
Any size is a prize.

2762
02:35:08,220 --> 02:35:08,980
So... true.

2763
02:35:12,770 --> 02:35:15,730
The true challenge of getting to 200 is the game not crashing.

2764
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:19,170
Don't forget the meaning.

2765
02:35:19,310 --> 02:35:21,630
Don't worry, I'm noticing the time.

2766
02:35:23,210 --> 02:35:23,970
Thank you though.

2767
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:34,220
All good.

2768
02:35:35,240 --> 02:35:36,060
Maybe.

2769
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:41,740
Is there anything out of...

2770
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:49,690
This!

2771
02:35:51,230 --> 02:35:52,950
We finally got the bomb shooter!

2772
02:35:54,910 --> 02:35:57,490
We finally got the balloon crush!

2773
02:35:58,130 --> 02:35:58,750
This one right?

2774
02:35:58,850 --> 02:35:59,090
Yeah!

2775
02:36:00,610 --> 02:36:02,290
Oh my gosh, finally.

2776
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:03,950
It happened!

2777
02:36:04,650 --> 02:36:05,690
It happened!

2778
02:36:05,690 --> 02:36:06,090
It happened!

2779
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:09,550
He's not even doing anything.

2780
02:36:09,630 --> 02:36:09,970
Is he?

2781
02:36:10,230 --> 02:36:10,870
Oh, there he goes.

2782
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:18,220
Nice.

2783
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:20,540
Nice!

2784
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,580
Guys, we only have 30 rounds left.

2785
02:36:39,790 --> 02:36:41,090
Oh, the pineapples.

2786
02:36:41,250 --> 02:36:42,210
That's what they do.

2787
02:36:42,410 --> 02:36:43,330
Oh, it's kind of weird.

2788
02:36:44,570 --> 02:36:45,670
I don't like it.

2789
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:51,310
Hmm...

2790
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:52,170
The super bunky?

2791
02:36:52,910 --> 02:36:54,350
He only has 45,000.

2792
02:36:57,090 --> 02:36:58,530
What's the longest we made it to?

2793
02:36:58,630 --> 02:37:00,290
I don't remember to be honest.

2794
02:37:00,410 --> 02:37:02,230
I feel like it was like 180 something.

2795
02:37:03,910 --> 02:37:04,510
I feel.

2796
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:06,050
Snipers?

2797
02:37:06,110 --> 02:37:07,190
My snipers are all here.

2798
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:22,300
I deploy everything we have.

2799
02:37:22,300 --> 02:37:25,280
Oh gosh.

2800
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:35,060
Deploy everything!

2801
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:37,380
Why are they getting stronger?

2802
02:37:41,570 --> 02:37:43,820
Okay, maybe we are okay.

2803
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:45,040
Maybe we are okay.

2804
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:53,700
Such chaos.

2805
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:00,740
Laser save us.

2806
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:02,420
It's okay.

2807
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:06,140
It's like they always say.

2808
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:08,340
When you are in for a penny...

2809
02:38:17,810 --> 02:38:20,270
Maybe a mortar monkey, but he doesn't have...

2810
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:22,350
I have him so upgraded, you know.

2811
02:38:23,490 --> 02:38:24,990
I'm trying to think of who else.

2812
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:32,340
Maybe grandmaster ninja monkey.

2813
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:35,200
We'll just get as many towers as we can.

2814
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:36,580
And that like...

2815
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:41,640
That can...

2816
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:43,860
What's the word?

2817
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:46,080
Do anything.

2818
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:48,380
That can upgrade to their full potential.

2819
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:53,860
Grand saboteur monkey.

2820
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:55,840
I can't unlock it though.

2821
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:56,980
I don't have it yet.

2822
02:38:58,280 --> 02:38:58,840
Glue storm.

2823
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:00,120
That's a good idea too.

2824
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:01,700
Good idea.

2825
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:04,940
I'm just gonna put him...

2826
02:39:12,790 --> 02:39:13,750
Glue storm.

2827
02:39:16,490 --> 02:39:16,970
Nice.

2828
02:39:21,530 --> 02:39:23,250
Glue storm will eat the frames.

2829
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:24,630
We have to do it though.

2830
02:39:25,310 --> 02:39:26,450
We have to do it.

2831
02:39:43,330 --> 02:39:45,550
Wait, you can lower the projectile size?

2832
02:39:45,630 --> 02:39:46,170
No way.

2833
02:39:47,490 --> 02:39:48,270
How do you do that?

2834
02:39:51,910 --> 02:39:53,050
I don't see it.

2835
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:56,270
I'm getting one guy maybe.

2836
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:11,890
Oh, accessibility.

2837
02:40:15,290 --> 02:40:20,650
Oh my god!

2838
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:36,500
It looks like...

2839
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:38,320
Oh my god, there are four ants!

2840
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:41,800
Oh my god!

2841
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:46,900
Everything is so tiny!

2842
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:52,840
That's so funny.

2843
02:40:54,220 --> 02:40:56,580
It doesn't make the bloons tiny though, right?

2844
02:40:56,660 --> 02:40:57,920
I still need to see those.

2845
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,420
I need to see those.

2846
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:02,540
Hold on, I'm gonna make it a little bit bigger.

2847
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:04,160
Like 30...

2848
02:41:04,160 --> 02:41:05,380
Thank you percent.

2849
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:07,280
They look just like you.

2850
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:07,680
Stop!

2851
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:10,140
Why am I catching strays?

2852
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:14,340
Oh no, okay, they're good size.

2853
02:41:14,460 --> 02:41:15,080
They're good size.

2854
02:41:16,220 --> 02:41:17,080
It's perfect.

2855
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:19,500
Oh, I hate actually how this looks.

2856
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:24,820
Maybe I don't like how that looks.

2857
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:25,780
Hold on.

2858
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:28,220
Sorry, I'm gonna make it smaller again.

2859
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:30,140
25 percent.

2860
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:31,900
Okay.

2861
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:34,720
Nice.

2862
02:41:41,670 --> 02:41:44,110
It looks like nothing is happening on the screen now.

2863
02:41:44,170 --> 02:41:45,370
And it's kind of stressing me out.

2864
02:41:50,030 --> 02:41:51,110
It's so small.

2865
02:41:51,190 --> 02:41:53,190
It looks like we're not even firing at them.

2866
02:41:53,470 --> 02:41:54,090
I'm scared.

2867
02:41:56,710 --> 02:41:57,190
173.

2868
02:41:57,390 --> 02:41:57,730
Okay.

2869
02:42:01,970 --> 02:42:02,890
173, you guys.

2870
02:42:03,710 --> 02:42:04,930
Make it zero, then panic.

2871
02:42:05,270 --> 02:42:05,470
No!

2872
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:08,450
The laser is gone!

2873
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:11,270
I don't like it.

2874
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:23,140
I can barely see the...

2875
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:26,880
The supply drop.

2876
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:30,860
Guys, I think we're gonna make it to a million bucks.

2877
02:42:32,660 --> 02:42:34,220
We're gonna make it to so much money.

2878
02:42:39,390 --> 02:42:40,590
Even the weeds are tiny.

2879
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:42,490
I know, the thorns are so small.

2880
02:42:44,010 --> 02:42:45,130
It's so funny.

2881
02:42:48,740 --> 02:42:50,420
I'm gonna be a millionaire.

2882
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:53,360
Just like the TV show.

2883
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:59,040
Wall Street should auto-collect the supply drop.

2884
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:00,400
I don't think it does, no?

2885
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:01,340
Let's see.

2886
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:02,560
Oh, it does!

2887
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:03,240
You're so right!

2888
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:06,240
I was a fool!

2889
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:08,020
Wow.

2890
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:09,680
I was a fool.

2891
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:13,740
Anything else we should add, everybody?

2892
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,140
I mean, I know there should be things we should add.

2893
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:17,860
I just don't know what.

2894
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:20,800
Check the bank?

2895
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:23,940
Oh, I have not checked the bank in a long time.

2896
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:29,720
Helicopter?

2897
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:33,320
Come on.

2898
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:34,080
No!

2899
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:35,900
Oh, yeah.

2900
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:39,240
This one is Apache.

2901
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:42,240
So we'll do this one as...

2902
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:44,740
Oh, we only have Apache on the...

2903
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:49,260
We'll do the Moab shove.

2904
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:52,500
And...

2905
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:54,720
Pursuit, maybe?

2906
02:43:59,550 --> 02:44:00,950
I like Pursuit.

2907
02:44:11,900 --> 02:44:14,940
I like how it doesn't flashbang me anymore.

2908
02:44:15,100 --> 02:44:15,860
It's kinda nice.

2909
02:44:20,840 --> 02:44:21,300
Push!

2910
02:44:21,380 --> 02:44:21,600
Push!

2911
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:22,380
Push!

2912
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:22,760
Push!

2913
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:23,120
Push!

2914
02:44:23,380 --> 02:44:23,380
Push!

2915
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:23,640
Push!

2916
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:24,080
Push!

2917
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,480
Oh, it collects it.

2918
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:32,740
I forgot.

2919
02:44:36,390 --> 02:44:37,190
Alright.

2920
02:44:42,090 --> 02:44:43,110
I think we're alright.

2921
02:44:43,590 --> 02:44:44,670
I think we got this.

2922
02:44:49,180 --> 02:44:50,380
We're fortified.

2923
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:56,420
Oh my gosh.

2924
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,920
The necromancer balloons are tiny too.

2925
02:44:58,920 --> 02:45:00,900
Oh, we got the phoenix too.

2926
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:01,800
We can do the phoenix.

2927
02:45:03,060 --> 02:45:04,000
Wizard monkey.

2928
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:05,820
Where should he go though?

2929
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:10,280
If I put him around here, will he be buffed?

2930
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:13,820
Yes.

2931
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:22,040
And...

2932
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:25,100
Maybe...

2933
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:28,460
Arcane blast?

2934
02:45:32,300 --> 02:45:32,880
Chihuahua.

2935
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:40,340
What other... What's the last wizard?

2936
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:42,660
Arc mage.

2937
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:46,040
Let's get him too.

2938
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:53,100
Also, wait.

2939
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:54,440
Not first.

2940
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:54,820
Strong.

2941
02:45:59,380 --> 02:46:00,760
I'm pressing everything.

2942
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:01,260
I'm pressing...

2943
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:03,340
Blue blast!

2944
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:03,860
Oh my gosh.

2945
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:05,820
Everything is moving so slowly.

2946
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:09,440
You got this game!

2947
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:10,820
You got this!

2948
02:46:24,110 --> 02:46:25,710
I think we're okay, maybe.

2949
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:28,790
I think we're okay.

2950
02:46:29,850 --> 02:46:30,910
Oh, why did I do that?

2951
02:46:31,030 --> 02:46:31,670
I'm such an idiot.

2952
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:32,150
No!

2953
02:46:32,550 --> 02:46:33,070
I didn't mean to.

2954
02:46:34,610 --> 02:46:35,610
I got ahead of myself.

2955
02:46:36,990 --> 02:46:38,030
Actually, maybe it's fine.

2956
02:46:50,910 --> 02:46:52,650
This guy's got no balloons.

2957
02:46:53,270 --> 02:46:54,890
I think I put him in a bad spot.

2958
02:46:56,050 --> 02:46:57,650
Maybe I should sell him and...

2959
02:46:57,650 --> 02:46:59,690
I wish I could re-home him.

2960
02:47:00,830 --> 02:47:03,670
I wish I could... There's a tower, right?

2961
02:47:03,710 --> 02:47:06,790
That allows you to move the minkis.

2962
02:47:07,450 --> 02:47:07,990
Check the bank.

2963
02:47:08,030 --> 02:47:08,590
I think it's okay.

2964
02:47:09,330 --> 02:47:10,250
Yeah, it's only at 800.

2965
02:47:11,990 --> 02:47:13,150
0-4-0.

2966
02:47:13,230 --> 02:47:13,990
Heli can move.

2967
02:47:14,190 --> 02:47:14,330
Yeah.

2968
02:47:17,730 --> 02:47:18,130
Okay.

2969
02:47:18,330 --> 02:47:20,070
Well, I have a lot of money so let's just get him.

2970
02:47:20,390 --> 02:47:21,150
It doesn't hurt.

2971
02:47:21,390 --> 02:47:23,230
It doesn't hurt to have him.

2972
02:47:23,810 --> 02:47:24,210
Probably.

2973
02:47:24,210 --> 02:47:24,370
Probably.

2974
02:47:25,810 --> 02:47:26,290
Zero.

2975
02:47:27,670 --> 02:47:28,150
Four.

2976
02:47:29,910 --> 02:47:31,550
And then, how do I use this?

2977
02:47:33,430 --> 02:47:35,010
Blows back many balloons.

2978
02:47:35,170 --> 02:47:35,670
Gains abilities.

2979
02:47:35,830 --> 02:47:36,410
Drops lives.

2980
02:47:36,650 --> 02:47:38,950
Cache crates and pick up and redeploy.

2981
02:47:39,850 --> 02:47:40,470
It's an ability.

2982
02:47:40,650 --> 02:47:41,070
Okay, okay.

2983
02:47:42,850 --> 02:47:45,670
Let's... I'm lazy so I just like to put them all on pursuit.

2984
02:47:45,770 --> 02:47:46,310
I'm not gonna lie.

2985
02:47:49,630 --> 02:47:50,110
Origin!

2986
02:47:50,650 --> 02:47:52,110
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

2987
02:47:52,110 --> 02:47:53,470
Thank you!

2988
02:47:57,710 --> 02:47:58,310
Oh.

2989
02:47:58,310 --> 02:47:59,350
I'll do it.

2990
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:00,010
Wait.

2991
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:08,360
I'm glad everyone else can relate.

2992
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:20,620
You can only do it mid-round?

2993
02:48:20,780 --> 02:48:21,100
Oh shoot.

2994
02:48:21,220 --> 02:48:21,380
Okay.

2995
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:22,340
You.

2996
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:24,140
And drop you.

2997
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:26,720
Oh no.

2998
02:48:27,580 --> 02:48:28,100
Oh no.

2999
02:48:28,100 --> 02:48:28,640
I'll do it.

3000
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:29,400
Do-do-do.

3001
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:30,480
Do-do-do.

3002
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:32,160
Do-do-do.

3003
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:34,760
Oh, good.

3004
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:35,660
Okay.

3005
02:48:36,740 --> 02:48:38,040
We still have him attached.

3006
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:39,220
Oh no, what do I do?

3007
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:40,960
Oh no, where do I put him?

3008
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:42,360
Oh no!

3009
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:45,880
I can put him here, no?

3010
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:48,020
This still works kind of, no?

3011
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:50,780
His range is really big.

3012
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:53,600
So I think it will work, no?

3013
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:53,660
No?

3014
02:48:56,580 --> 02:48:57,260
Yeah?

3015
02:49:01,820 --> 02:49:03,860
One more time!

3016
02:49:05,900 --> 02:49:07,380
There we go.

3017
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:09,420
Wait, why didn't he move?

3018
02:49:10,180 --> 02:49:10,720
Oh, there he goes.

3019
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:10,980
Okay.

3020
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:11,800
Nice.

3021
02:49:15,160 --> 02:49:16,360
I'm flicking everything.

3022
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:18,360
I'm flicking it all.

3023
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:20,400
Glue bomb!

3024
02:49:21,340 --> 02:49:22,060
Yeah,

3025
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:29,680
get pushed.

3026
02:49:29,780 --> 02:49:30,460
Get pushed.

3027
02:49:33,250 --> 02:49:34,390
Get pushed.

3028
02:49:34,490 --> 02:49:35,050
Get pushed.

3029
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:36,090
The frames.

3030
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:37,530
I know, it's so bad.

3031
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:40,250
It's so bad, it's funny.

3032
02:49:49,730 --> 02:49:50,450
Nice.

3033
02:49:51,130 --> 02:49:53,590
Oh my gosh, almost a 20.

3034
02:49:53,870 --> 02:49:56,630
Almost a 20 rounds left.

3035
02:49:57,530 --> 02:49:58,910
This game is so demanding.

3036
02:49:59,910 --> 02:50:02,270
Time to upgrade my computer to NASA.

3037
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:07,940
Move alchemist?

3038
02:50:07,980 --> 02:50:08,740
Yeah, but to where?

3039
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:12,380
Nowhere to move him.

3040
02:50:30,170 --> 02:50:31,410
The frames.

3041
02:50:32,810 --> 02:50:34,290
The slowest game ever.

3042
02:50:37,170 --> 02:50:39,390
Is this how people usually play?

3043
02:50:40,090 --> 02:50:41,270
You play like this?

3044
02:50:42,190 --> 02:50:43,750
Yeah, I play Bloons.

3045
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:47,950
Everyone needs a 50-80 for Bloons.

3046
02:50:51,110 --> 02:50:54,770
This game will surely be the one to set your PC on fire though.

3047
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:07,620
Buy the snipers or the heli?

3048
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:08,020
Okay.

3049
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:09,000
The alchemist?

3050
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:10,740
Because then he'll buff these guys, no?

3051
02:51:20,930 --> 02:51:21,330
Okay.

3052
02:51:21,930 --> 02:51:23,070
Oh, I have to do it mid-round.

3053
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:23,750
Okay, here we go.

3054
02:51:24,750 --> 02:51:26,410
Oh, I have to make sure I click the right guy.

3055
02:51:26,410 --> 02:51:28,330
Okay, here we go.

3056
02:51:30,310 --> 02:51:31,890
Oh, he'll only buff a couple.

3057
02:51:50,860 --> 02:51:51,640
Oh gosh.

3058
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:52,460
Oh golly.

3059
02:51:53,060 --> 02:51:53,560
Oh golly.

3060
02:51:53,660 --> 02:51:54,060
Oh gosh.

3061
02:51:54,140 --> 02:51:54,520
Oh golly.

3062
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:55,000
Oh gosh.

3063
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:55,420
Oh golly.

3064
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:55,920
Oh gosh.

3065
02:51:55,980 --> 02:51:56,320
Oh golly.

3066
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:56,800
Oh gosh.

3067
02:51:57,460 --> 02:51:58,260
Oh gosh.

3068
02:51:58,840 --> 02:52:00,420
Everything is scaring me right now.

3069
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:02,260
180!

3070
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:26,470
I'm just gonna keep boosting my laser.

3071
02:52:27,750 --> 02:52:29,110
I'm boosting my laser.

3072
02:52:31,530 --> 02:52:32,750
I'm doing everything.

3073
02:52:32,910 --> 02:52:33,770
I'm clicking it all.

3074
02:52:35,110 --> 02:52:36,550
I'm clicking it all.

3075
02:52:44,830 --> 02:52:45,470
You.

3076
02:52:45,470 --> 02:52:46,110
You.

3077
02:52:46,410 --> 02:52:46,810
You.

3078
02:52:47,130 --> 02:52:47,370
You.

3079
02:52:47,750 --> 02:52:48,410
Okay, nevermind.

3080
02:52:48,470 --> 02:52:48,850
Not you.

3081
02:52:50,310 --> 02:52:50,690
You?

3082
02:52:51,070 --> 02:52:51,370
You?

3083
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:54,610
It's not... It's like not...

3084
02:52:55,190 --> 02:52:56,350
For some reason.

3085
02:53:04,640 --> 02:53:07,280
Is one million gold possible in this run?

3086
02:53:07,380 --> 02:53:08,080
Oh, absolutely.

3087
02:53:08,320 --> 02:53:09,300
We're basically there.

3088
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:12,160
We're basically there, no?

3089
02:53:15,460 --> 02:53:15,980
Please!

3090
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:26,240
Nice.

3091
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:27,180
Nice.

3092
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:34,540
A million!

3093
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:36,900
I'm a millionaire!

3094
02:53:38,360 --> 02:53:39,800
That's me, mom!

3095
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:42,040
That's me, mom!

3096
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:42,780
I'm a millionaire!

3097
02:53:58,740 --> 02:54:01,740
I don't know why it doesn't like this one down here in the corner.

3098
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:02,400
There we go.

3099
02:54:03,800 --> 02:54:07,400
It just really doesn't like to grab to let me press it.

3100
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:13,160
I like that comment.

3101
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:16,320
If you invest in better defense, it will be easier to get to round 200.

3102
02:54:18,740 --> 02:54:19,880
That's the game.

3103
02:54:21,080 --> 02:54:24,100
It's a defense game.

3104
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:25,960
That's all you can do.

3105
02:54:42,560 --> 02:54:44,220
That's all you can do.

3106
02:54:44,220 --> 02:54:44,240
No!

3107
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:54,760
It's so funny.

3108
02:54:59,350 --> 02:55:02,050
I don't think we'll be able to do that one.

3109
02:55:05,050 --> 02:55:06,230
It's a funny comment.

3110
02:55:11,790 --> 02:55:12,630
Wait, hold on.

3111
02:55:12,810 --> 02:55:14,970
Let me double check if my... Oh yeah, my meeting.

3112
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:22,080
I'm asking.

3113
02:55:37,610 --> 02:55:38,530
Hot dog.

3114
02:55:38,690 --> 02:55:39,410
Thank you!

3115
02:55:39,810 --> 02:55:40,750
Thanks, Trine Princess.

3116
02:55:47,290 --> 02:55:48,830
Round 200 next stream?

3117
02:55:49,430 --> 02:55:50,210
Yeah, maybe.

3118
02:55:52,470 --> 02:55:54,410
Play muted while it streams?

3119
02:55:56,170 --> 02:55:57,310
Or while in the meeting?

3120
02:56:00,390 --> 02:56:01,470
Sorry I'm late.

3121
02:56:01,530 --> 02:56:02,690
I became a millionaire.

3122
02:56:05,630 --> 02:56:07,030
We might have to save it.

3123
02:56:07,810 --> 02:56:09,110
We might have to save it.

3124
02:56:10,070 --> 02:56:11,770
We're so close though.

3125
02:56:12,730 --> 02:56:14,210
We're so close.

3126
02:56:15,570 --> 02:56:16,970
We're so close.

3127
02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:22,670
Complimentary birthday, Supa.

3128
02:56:23,090 --> 02:56:24,610
It already passed on March 2nd though.

3129
02:56:24,670 --> 02:56:26,010
That's so long ago.

3130
02:56:27,370 --> 02:56:27,630
Where?

3131
02:56:27,830 --> 02:56:28,830
I was here.

3132
02:56:30,590 --> 02:56:33,990
First thing I did was hop on MGSV for the birthday cutscene.

3133
02:56:35,410 --> 02:56:37,090
Nana, happy birthday!

3134
02:56:38,330 --> 02:56:40,890
Happy birthday to you.

3135
02:56:41,470 --> 02:56:43,730
Happy birthday to you.

3136
02:56:44,030 --> 02:56:46,610
Happy birthday dear Nana.

3137
02:56:48,210 --> 02:56:51,110
Happy birthday to you.

3138
02:56:52,530 --> 02:56:53,390
Happy birthday!

3139
02:56:54,450 --> 02:56:55,790
I spent too much at the mint cafe.

3140
02:56:56,010 --> 02:56:56,470
Thank you.

3141
02:56:56,530 --> 02:56:57,470
Oh my gosh, thank you.

3142
02:56:58,850 --> 02:56:59,910
Thank you, thank you.

3143
02:57:00,250 --> 02:57:01,410
Let's do one more round.

3144
02:57:03,230 --> 02:57:04,710
Who else can we add?

3145
02:57:06,430 --> 02:57:07,110
More...

3146
02:57:08,590 --> 02:57:10,570
More monkey pirates.

3147
02:57:21,800 --> 02:57:23,000
We'll do this one.

3148
02:57:24,060 --> 02:57:25,360
Bigger range.

3149
02:57:26,240 --> 02:57:27,320
More monkeys.

3150
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:30,440
I'm sorry I'm late.

3151
02:57:31,540 --> 02:57:32,400
I'm becoming a millionaire.

3152
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:34,460
I'm becoming the Bloons champion.

3153
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:37,820
You can't blame me.

3154
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:39,740
I'm a Bloons champion.

3155
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:51,640
No one ever popped.

3156
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:56,560
Oh, they actually know this one.

3157
02:57:58,280 --> 02:57:59,360
Attack faster.

3158
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:02,840
Everybody, keep attacking.

3159
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:04,940
And keep making money.

3160
02:58:07,580 --> 02:58:08,960
I don't think it's in range.

3161
02:58:10,460 --> 02:58:11,800
I hear the foam still.

3162
02:58:11,840 --> 02:58:12,620
You guys hear that?

3163
02:58:21,190 --> 02:58:23,170
Where does that thing drop?

3164
02:58:24,790 --> 02:58:26,230
Game is dying.

3165
02:58:26,930 --> 02:58:27,550
Check my bank.

3166
02:58:27,610 --> 02:58:28,290
It's fine.

3167
02:58:28,490 --> 02:58:29,390
I checked the bank.

3168
02:58:29,550 --> 02:58:30,130
I checked it.

3169
02:58:30,330 --> 02:58:30,770
It's okay.

3170
02:58:32,670 --> 02:58:33,050
Hello?

3171
02:58:34,970 --> 02:58:35,730
There we go.

3172
02:58:43,340 --> 02:58:44,680
Spoken like a real millionaire.

3173
02:58:46,900 --> 02:58:47,720
I know, right?

3174
02:58:50,740 --> 02:58:51,180
Go!

3175
02:58:51,340 --> 02:58:51,600
Go!

3176
02:58:51,740 --> 02:58:51,920
Go!

3177
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:52,160
Go!

3178
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:02,940
Oh, I could.

3179
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:03,360
I could.

3180
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:03,820
I could.

3181
02:59:07,450 --> 02:59:08,490
Attack faster!

3182
02:59:09,050 --> 02:59:09,750
Attack harder!

3183
02:59:12,630 --> 02:59:13,710
Oh my...

3184
02:59:14,650 --> 02:59:18,190
I was going to say minions, but make it like blinions.

3185
02:59:21,670 --> 02:59:23,190
My Bloon minions.

3186
02:59:23,950 --> 02:59:25,250
I can't save this.

3187
02:59:25,670 --> 02:59:26,770
I don't think I can save it.

3188
02:59:29,030 --> 02:59:31,010
I can't save it.

3189
02:59:33,050 --> 02:59:34,470
There we go.

3190
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:42,320
Okay,

3191
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:48,980
I'm being called upon.

3192
02:59:50,720 --> 02:59:53,300
I'm becoming... I'm being called upon.

3193
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,480
Well guys, one more round.

3194
02:59:56,480 --> 02:59:56,520
One more round.

3195
02:59:58,980 --> 03:00:00,280
We can't end it.

3196
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:02,280
We have to end it on 185, no?

3197
03:00:07,160 --> 03:00:07,600
Go!

3198
03:00:07,740 --> 03:00:08,000
Go!

3199
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:08,440
Go!

3200
03:00:11,420 --> 03:00:12,400
We got this.

3201
03:00:12,460 --> 03:00:12,940
We got this.

3202
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:13,460
We got this.

3203
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:14,080
We got this.

3204
03:00:15,440 --> 03:00:16,260
We got this.

3205
03:00:16,300 --> 03:00:16,720
We got this.

3206
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:17,280
We got this.

3207
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:20,280
We're doing so well.

3208
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:27,080
It's fine.

3209
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:27,740
They understand.

3210
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:29,620
It's fine.

3211
03:00:29,700 --> 03:00:30,220
They understand.

3212
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:35,760
I was popping off.

3213
03:00:37,180 --> 03:00:38,220
It's true.

3214
03:00:41,750 --> 03:00:44,410
I haven't even seen anything this round.

3215
03:00:56,160 --> 03:00:56,800
Monkey!

3216
03:00:57,440 --> 03:00:58,020
Monkey!

3217
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:00,740
Thank you Weebsie for 4 months.

3218
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:01,700
Kyle!

3219
03:01:01,940 --> 03:01:02,360
Thank you.

3220
03:01:03,080 --> 03:01:04,320
We're not well met.

3221
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:07,260
That super chat reminded me that my birthday was on the 4th.

3222
03:01:08,300 --> 03:01:09,360
Solid Snake.

3223
03:01:09,540 --> 03:01:12,460
Okay, we'll do a nice birthday song and then I gotta go for real.

3224
03:01:12,880 --> 03:01:13,200
For real.

3225
03:01:13,460 --> 03:01:13,740
For real.

3226
03:01:14,740 --> 03:01:17,240
Happy birthday to you.

3227
03:01:17,460 --> 03:01:19,480
Happy birthday to you.

3228
03:01:20,080 --> 03:01:22,680
Happy birthday, Solid Snake0079.

3229
03:01:24,360 --> 03:01:26,740
Happy birthday to you.

3230
03:01:27,800 --> 03:01:28,940
Happy birthday.

3231
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:32,840
By the way, your laugh is the best protector.

3232
03:01:32,920 --> 03:01:33,980
Maybe a nebulizer.

3233
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:34,480
Maybe.

3234
03:01:34,480 --> 03:01:37,480
I do have something like that.

3235
03:01:47,520 --> 03:01:48,360
Next time.

3236
03:01:48,480 --> 03:01:48,660
Wait.

3237
03:01:48,980 --> 03:01:49,940
If I... Hold on.

3238
03:01:51,540 --> 03:01:52,420
How does it save?

3239
03:01:52,520 --> 03:01:54,220
If I just click home, will it save?

3240
03:01:56,860 --> 03:01:58,740
If I click home...

3241
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:00,420
Do I have to exit out of the game completely?

3242
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:01,000
I'm scared.

3243
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:02,660
Yes?

3244
03:02:05,990 --> 03:02:07,450
Wait, I got an achievement.

3245
03:02:07,810 --> 03:02:10,090
Reveal 10,000 Bloons using Shimmer.

3246
03:02:10,330 --> 03:02:10,690
Neat.

3247
03:02:13,090 --> 03:02:13,950
I get monkey money.

3248
03:02:14,750 --> 03:02:16,130
Win a game in reverse mode.

3249
03:02:16,270 --> 03:02:16,570
Nice.

3250
03:02:18,270 --> 03:02:18,670
Wait.

3251
03:02:19,110 --> 03:02:20,850
How close are we to...

3252
03:02:21,570 --> 03:02:23,930
Still so many Bloons.

3253
03:02:24,370 --> 03:02:25,250
So many.

3254
03:02:27,810 --> 03:02:28,310
Okay.

3255
03:02:30,090 --> 03:02:31,110
I'll go play this combat.

3256
03:02:33,250 --> 03:02:34,010
But...

3257
03:02:35,050 --> 03:02:37,110
We didn't make it to our...

3258
03:02:38,770 --> 03:02:40,410
To our goal today.

3259
03:02:40,690 --> 03:02:42,190
But we're so close.

3260
03:02:42,770 --> 03:02:45,530
We're like so stinking close you guys.

3261
03:02:46,030 --> 03:02:48,290
We'll make it next time.

3262
03:02:54,690 --> 03:02:56,550
Thank you guys.

3263
03:02:56,930 --> 03:02:57,690
Thank you, thank you.

3264
03:02:57,690 --> 03:02:58,750
See you guys.

3265
03:02:58,850 --> 03:02:59,390
Bye bye.

3266
03:03:01,330 --> 03:03:03,150
Oh wait, I wanted to check real quick.

3267
03:03:03,490 --> 03:03:03,950
I'm scared.

3268
03:03:05,850 --> 03:03:06,950
Okay, save.

3269
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:08,530
It's there, it's there, it's there.

3270
03:03:09,030 --> 03:03:09,770
Bye bye!
