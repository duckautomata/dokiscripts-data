Wow.

3
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,630
I can't believe it has those numbers in there.

4
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,570
That's crazy.

5
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,550
And five more.

6
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,870
Oh my God.

7
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:25,830
Wow.

8
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,950
That's my social security number.

9
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,810
Wow.

10
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,570
All right.

11
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:37,390
Anybody who wants a piece of made mint precious money.

12
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:37,870
Yep.

13
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,190
What do you even get out of having someone's social security number?

14
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,010
Identity.

15
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,170
fraud.

16
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,270
They could become me!

17
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,210
Yeah, we're all mint.

18
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,690
We're all mint-o.

19
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,130
Oh yeah, you guys could open a credit card.

20
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,330
Yeah, everyone open a credit card, but like take care of it really well and increase mint's credit score.

21
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:23,570
I'll get like updates, they'll be like you're overdue on a payment and I'll just make a community post being like hey whoever didn't pay your bill get to yeah

22
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:49,450
okay that's actually a great idea that's not like fraud is it if like it feels too good to be fraud if that's fraud then I don't want to be right exactly I don't want to be yeah like having your viewers open uh uh cards in your name so that they can increase your credit score.

23
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,070
There was one time I was watching Matara's stream.

24
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,830
This was like a year ago or something.

25
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,170
And she was like seriously proposing some sort of like...

26
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,530
I don't remember.

27
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,750
It was like some sort of money scheme.

28
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,590
And she was just like, I'm going to do this.

29
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,290
And everyone in her chat was like, you can't do that.

30
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,070
You're going to go to jail.

31
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,370
I think she should have done it.

32
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,890
I think it's okay.

33
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,750
If you have a pure heart, then it shouldn't matter if you commit a crime.

34
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,550
It was so funny.

35
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,950
I was watching it.

36
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,470
And just everyone.

37
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,710
Yeah, it was like some sort of pyramid scheme or something.

38
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,110
I wish he was legitimately proposing it.

39
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,690
It was so funny.

40
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,290
It was crazy.

41
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,170
What the hell?

42
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,270
Or a stocks thing.

43
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:42,750
Yeah.

44
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,550
I don't know.

45
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,210
She's so silly.

46
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,550
Matara Khan.

47
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,270
No.

48
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,470
Matara fraud.

49
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,650
Matara fraud.

50
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,210
No.

51
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,230
Let's create a pyramid scheme together, Barry.

52
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,610
Okay.

53
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,790
What do you want the main thing to be?

54
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,670
We should...

55
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,690
Should we sell something or should we like...

56
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,110
Yeah.

57
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,650
Maybe we should...

58
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,770
Maybe we should sell something or maybe we should...

59
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,050
I kind of think it would be honest.

60
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:22,390
if we like locked like a hundred bug bros and a hundred wisps in like a room and just and like you know like had a death game or something.

61
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,410
Oh yeah that's not a pyramid scheme but it's still like a scheme.

62
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,990
That is a scheme yeah.

63
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:42,930
I was thinking I was thinking we create a business where you like sell smiles and then you know you you then recruit more people to smell sell smiles.

64
00:07:44,070 --> 00:08:36,830
and then they should do it do it like you know um like in times square like when you take a picture with a mascot they like hound you to pay them they should yeah yeah yeah yeah so you tell you like you go up to a person you tell a joke and they laugh and you like harass them for five bucks yeah you're like hello and then and then you're like okay well if you don't want to pay me five bucks uh then you have to go to another person and make them smile yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh there's so many smiles in my chat right now yeah everyone's so everyone's smiling you guys stop i accidentally said smell now they're making fun of you it's okay i think you're cute when you're made fun of that's messed up

65
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,670
oh wait wrong toggle wait what did you toggle what What did you do?

66
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,010
The knife.

67
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,230
I took out the knife.

68
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:47,630

88
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,910

I sell smiles.

113
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,450
I was recruited two years ago.

114
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,630
I'm ranked...

115
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,130
Wow.

116
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,210
I'm ranked 50,072.

117
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,210
Yeah.

118
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,330
Um.

119
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,430
Wow, you're high enough to like, when you die, you're definitely going to get a planet.

120
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,410
Oh yeah.

121
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,770
I forgot to say, our pyramid scheme works like Scientology.

122
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,370
Hell yeah.

124
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,330
So you'll become astral projected when you sell enough smiles.

125
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,210
And everybody below you also sells enough smiles.

126
00:11:39,450 --> 00:12:08,110
yeah yeah and see you guys definitely want to sell some smiles now right this is i feel like this is just smiling friends oh my god wait i've never watched that show but i learned okay have you heard about the what is it like awesome autistic gamer 777 a cool autistic gamer i forgot the about that.

127
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,130
I don't, I've never watched Smiling Friends before, but I learned about that the other day.

128
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,550
It's so funny.

129
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:26,990
I'm just gonna start doing that with you where I'm just gonna like, I'm just gonna have clips of you on my stream and I'm just gonna like pretend it's a collab where it's like you're like playing India and Jones and I'm just like, wow, that was a nice one,

130
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,390
Mint.

131
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,370
And you like time it where I'm like, oh, thanks.

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,230
And then you'll be like, hi.

133
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,550
You just watched it awesome.

134
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,450
You just watched the cool bug gamer.

135
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,210
774.

136
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,370
Thank you.

137
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,170
Thank you.

138
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,070
I know.

139
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,230
I've been kind of obsessed with that concept.

140
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,070
It's so funny.

141
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,350
He's so awesome, actually.

142
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,890
Because he's been getting better at like animate.

143
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,070
People think it's like a psyop by one of the creators.

144
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,450
No, it has to be.

145
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,310
Because there's like, he's now in the show.

146
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,390
And...

147
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,430
Like, it's kind of insane.

148
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,710
Like, kids, but I don't know.

149
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,650
They've been doing it for, like, years.

150
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,150
So it's crazy.

151
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,590
It's, like, the longest running joke ever.

152
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,490
It's so silly.

153
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,110
It's so crazy, man.

154
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,170
The fact that it's, like, even somewhat believable that one of the creators can be behind it is, like, insane to me.

155
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,570
Have you watched Smiling Friend?

156
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,150
Yeah.

157
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,410
Oh, my God.

158
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:33,810
Yeah.

159
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,370
Is it good?

160
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,390
It's very, it's very fun.

161
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,250
There's like stuff that there's stuff that I repeat from that show all the time.

162
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,190
It's so bad.

163
00:13:42,390 --> 00:14:08,470
Okay, I'm gonna watch it now Yeah, it's so it like gets into your brain like a little worm You're gonna you're gonna start saying you're gonna start repeating stuff from that show my real person Oshi is also in that Show as a voice actor Rocco's in the show not Rocco If he were in it,

164
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,750
that would make sense too.

165
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,690
No, it's this guy named Mike Staclossa.

166
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,590
He's from a YouTube channel called Red Letter Media.

167
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,150
And he is my Oshie.

168
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,710
Who was he in the show?

169
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,770
I don't remember the guy's name.

170
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,630
He wants to die.

171
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,190
He wants to die?

172
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:32,710
Yeah.

173
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,330
I feel like that could probably be a lot of characters in the show, to be honest.

174
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,970

Like, actually, he's so silly.

183
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,650
It's really cool because they have, like, a lot of new grounds people, like, and a lot of old internet references.

186
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,550
Kind of very like Gumball.

187
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,090
Gumball-ish.

188
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,330

They have like Claymation.

190
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,810
They have like a PlayStation character in one of the episodes where he's like all polygonal.

191
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:21,830
It's crazy.

192

Woo!

200
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:41,270
Yeah, and but speaking of Newgrounds, this game is very Newgrounds coded, I feel.

201
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:41,930
We're here!

202
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,550
We're back with Battle Block, Berry Block Theater.

203
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,650
We're back with Meat and Block Kingdom.

204
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,470
Yeah!

205
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,530
What?

206
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,610
What?

207
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,990
What?

208
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,370
What?

209
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,210
You know, after our collab, I went to Newgrounds and I was like, I wonder if any of those games are still there.

210
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,090
But now you need an account!

211
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,650
Oh, really?

212
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,270
Okay.

213
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,330
To look at like...

214
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,350
Oh, that is also dead, no?

215
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:20,990
Oh.

216
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,710
Oh, I don't know what they did with all the games, right?

217
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,550
Hmm.

218
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,750
Did they, did they like adapt all the games?

219
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,350
I have no idea.

220
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,090
I haven't been since...

221
00:17:34,390 --> 00:18:05,430
forever so i have no idea yeah there's also flashpoint there where they save like a bunch of old flash games and like uh animations that you can use too yeah yeah yeah minto's not able to play meat and kingdom anymore i just wanted to relive my nostalgia i was like oh i'll go see what they're if they're there walking along i'm going doing my little side quests the elves.

222
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,070
Oh, no.

223
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,390
The controller just...

224
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,670
Wait, your controller is acting up.

225
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,190
What the heck?

226
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:14,890
No, it's okay.

227
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,810
It disconnected because we're inactive.

228
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:18,870
Oh, okay, okay.

229
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,550
That makes sense.

230
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,270
Yeah.

231
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,230
But yeah, so...

232
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,950
I was gonna go see.

233
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,510
And then, um...

234
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,670
Yeah, you need an account.

235
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,410
And I was like, I don't think I'm gonna make a new crowds account.

236
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,650
So...

237
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,450
You don't want to start...

238
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,370
You don't want to start uploading.

239
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,410
uploading content to Newgrounds.

240
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,510
You should- Wait, can you- I wonder if you could stream on Newgrounds.

241
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,450
Wait, you could probably- Maybe, but you could definitely upload videos at least, right?

242
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,390
Wait, I would love to see you on Newgrounds.

243
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,590
Wait, I have a game.

244
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,290
And- What, really?

245
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,970
Yeah, you're in it, remember?

246
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,370
Oh, oh!

247
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,870
I thought we met a different genre.

248
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,570
I was like, what are you doing?

249
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,490
I mean, I mean, I could make one.

250
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,770
Mint and...

251
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,470
Just like one of those visual novel, novel-like creator things.

252
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,490
And then I'll do all the art and the voice acting.

253
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,750
Oh my god, wait.

254
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,030
Like you should draw all the art yourself.

255
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,770
Yeah.

256
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,370
Yeah, well, we'll meet.

Let's play Battle Block Theater.

260
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,990
Yeah, we're playing, of course, we have to play Meat and Block Kingdom.

261
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,910

262
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,350

266
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,270
All right, let's start.

I forgot which one I was.

271
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,850
You forgot I was the triangle head.

272
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,570
Yeah, we're both cats, I think, right?

273
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,230
Yeah, we're little cats.

274
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:44,470
Ah!

275
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,770

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,990
I'm bullying you.

279
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,010
Why?

280
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:50,750
Why?

281
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,750
It's silly!

282
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,130
It is silly!

283
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,590
Oh, no!

284
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,690
Oh, wait, where'd she go?

285
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,270
You pushed me into the other room.

286
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,190
What's wrong with you?

287
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,590

Ah!

293
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,990
Fight back, Berrybug!

294
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,930

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,510
Uh, with this, oh, okay, never mind.

352
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,210
We're not.

353
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,090
Oh!

354
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:42,770
Ow!

355
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,710
Ow!

356
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,590
I died!

357
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,090
Oh, I think we need to stack them.

358
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,970
We need to stack them.

359
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,190
Yeah, yeah.

360
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,110
How did I die?

361
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,010
How did I die?

362
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:55,850
How?

363
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:55,870
How?

364
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,250
What the heck?

365
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,310
How will this affect our time?

366
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,890
Oh, help me out!

367
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,910
Do you remember how to do that?

368
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,550
Wait, why are you crossing your arms?

369
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,910
Don't explode on me.

370
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,050
Oh, it's that button.

371
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,390
Oh, there you go.

372
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,670
No, no, keep doing it.

373
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,070
Keep doing it.

374
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,890
Keep doing it.

375
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,190
Wait, why?

376
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,250
What's happening?

377
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,940
There we go.

378
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,360
My god!

379
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,560
Why are you keep dying?

380
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,720
I don't know, why do I keep dying?

381
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,360
Why do you save me?

382
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,660
Okay, okay.

383
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,480
I'll help you.

384
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,920
Oh, oops.

385
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,520
Don't look there.

386
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,500
Don't look now, but...

387
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,480
Don't look that way.

388
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,040
What the heck?

389
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,600
How do we do that?

390
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh, we have to go from above.

391
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,200
I think.

392
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,440
I don't think we're beating the speed run for this.

393
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,420
There you go.

394
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:00,900
Good job.

395
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,480
Good job.

396
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,020
Oh, thank you.

397
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,820
Thank you.

398
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,200
I don't know what that...

399
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,720
Oh!

400
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,120
Okay, these developers might be a little bit smart.

401
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,020
Oh!

402
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:12,980
Oh, oh, oh!

403
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,400
Kill him!

404
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:13,680
Kill him!

405
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,760
I killed him!

406
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,820
You're a killer.

407
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,240
You're a...

408
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,040
This is the...

409
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,580
Why do I keep dying?

410
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,560
I don't touch his head.

411
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,700
Oh, dude!

412
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,160
Wait!

413
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,580
Ah!

414
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,280
Kill him!

415
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,160
Oh, good job.

416
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,020
Wait, oh no!

417
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,640
Oh, wait, do we need...

418
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,820
Okay, I got it.

419
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,120
It's okay.

420
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,960
Yeah, good enough.

421
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,120
Okay, let's go.

422
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,340
There you go.

423
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,460
Look at us working together.

424
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,220
Oh, isn't it nice?

425
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,140
Yeah!

426
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,700
Look at us!

427
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,400
Look at us!

428
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:42,720
Look at us!

429
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,540
Okay, now...

430
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,760
Oh!

431
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,460
Oh!

432
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:57,520
Oh!

433
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
Wait, which way are we going?

434
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,040
Oh!

435
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,140
I don't know.

436
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,160
Where are we going?

437
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:01,900
In here!

438
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,540
Go!

439
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,240
Oh!

440
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,760
Get in there!

441
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,480
Get in there!

442
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,740
Oh, I can't!

443
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,160
I can't!

444
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,480
Stop!

445
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,020
I can't!

446
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,660
You're right.

447
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,500
You're right.

448
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,100
Um...

449
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,860
Then what do we do?

450
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,880
And we think we go up.

451
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,140
Oops.

452
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,680
Oh, there's a teleporting thing somewhere.

453
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,680
Oh, wait.

454
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,920
Is this not a...

455
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,260
Oh, nope.

456
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,780
There's gotta be a secret here.

457
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,720
Ah!

458
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,720
What are you laughing at?

459
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,400
Ah, how cute you are!

460
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,600
I'm looking.

461
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm...

462
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,040
Ah!

463
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,580
Observing.

464
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,020
Hold on.

465
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,440
Wait.

466
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,720
How do I go back down?

467
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,980
We have to like, yeah, we have to like go down here.

468
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:43,800
Ow!

469
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,380
But I don't know how to, how do you do that?

470
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,120
Oh, no, I don't know.

471
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

472
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,780
What are we doing?

473
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,820
I don't know.

474
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,000
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

475
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,780
This is really, this is really shaving off, shaving on a lot of time.

476
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,160
Yeah.

477
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,900
This is really adding a lot of time to our speed run.

478
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,200
I thought I could do it.

479
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,940
I thought I could, I could tank it.

480
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,960
I should, I could take it.

481
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

482
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,080
No, no, we definitely do.

483
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,180
We have to, we have to go up.

484
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,180
How'd you do that?

485
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,920
With my brain.

487
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,740
Oh.

488
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,980
Oh, okay.

489
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
This is fine.

490
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,740
Okay.

491
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,740
And then boom.

492
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,460
And then, oh, whoa.

493
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,020
Is that it?

494
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,020
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

495
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,620
Okay, now we're good.

496
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,060
Now, okay.

497
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,920
I'm fine.

498
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,820
We're fine.

499
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,520
Everything's okay.

500
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,900
Okay, okay, we're back.

501
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,220
We're back.

502
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,060
We're back to her.

503
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,550
I forgot that that was a thing.

504
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,740
Just like seeing you die in like a thousand different ways.

505
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,820
Wait, I don't...

506
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,720
Oh, there's another gemmy!

507
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,640
Yeah, yeah, get that.

508
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,080
Get that.

509
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,780
Oh, how do I?

510
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,680
I will get it.

511
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,320
I will get it.

512
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,020
I'm getting it.

513
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,380
Okay.

514
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,580
Yeah, wait, wait, there's more!

515
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,440
Is there another one?

516
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:56,900
Okay.

517
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,980
Why can't I jump?

518
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,200
What's wrong with me?

519
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,420
I'm leaving this tree.

520
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,960
It is weird.

521
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,660
We have to get used to the game again, guys.

522
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,060
It's been a while, okay?

523
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,120
Oh my God, we just missed two!

524
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,820
We've been!

525
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
Oh, no way.

526
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,380
It's because we were too busy speed running, obviously.

527
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,240
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,400
Oh, I think I need to throw you.

529
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,400
I think I need to throw you.

530
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,020
Oh, okay, okay.

531
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,160
Welcome back.

532
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,560
Oh.

533
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

534
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:31,940
Oh, oh.

535
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,580
Okay.

536
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,200
Go, go, go.

537
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,180
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

538
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,100
Okay, okay.

539
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,620
Okay.

540
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,060
What was that for?

541
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,220

00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,490
Okay, we're fine now.

721
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,390
Okay.

722
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,650
Also, thank you for the raid, Lumi.

723
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,930
Thank you, thank you.

724
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,210
Thank you for the raid!

725
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,010
Thank you!

726
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,830
Get it!

727
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,030
Get it!

728
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,050
I'm trying!

729
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:35,790
Get it!

730
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,410
I'm trying!

731
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,510
Oops!

732
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,390
I deserve that.

733
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:44,050
Ah!

734
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,490
What do we do?

735
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,130
Okay.

736
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,810
There's also, I think maybe, I don't know actually.

737
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:53,910
Maybe...

738
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,950
Oh, oh, wait!

739
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,550
Leap, wait.

740
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,630
Oh, oh.

741
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,390
Jump on my head!

742
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,170
Jump, jump!

743
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,070
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

744
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:01,790
Okay.

745
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,690
Oh, I think you need to throw me, or I throw you.

746
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,670
Oh, okay, okay.

747
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:09,210
Okay.

748
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,050
Okay.

749
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,130
Up there.

750
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,510
Nice.

751
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,310
We're here.

752
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,550
Thank you.

753
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,130
Oh, ha!

754
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:21,510
Whoa!

755
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:22,750
Wow!

756
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,920
Why I just thought, why are you kicking me while I'm down?

757
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,600
That's not very...

758
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,020
sportsmanship of you.

759
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,260
Wait, you're the one who's making everything terrible.

760
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,320
I'm making it terrible.

761
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,300
Oh my god.

762
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,500
Is that how you do it?

763
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,240
What is that?

764
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,260
I don't know, actually, what we're supposed to do here.

765
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,480
Oops.

766
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,380
I didn't get...

767
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,600
I can't.

768
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,940
Oh, we need two of them.

769
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,680
Yeah, I know.

770
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,420
That's why I was trying to get the other.

771
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,860
Wait, where does it go?

772
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,980
It goes to...

773
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,080
Wait, hold on.

774
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,700
I want to see...

775
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,340
Is this anything?

776
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,180
Like up here?

777
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,240
Yeah!

778
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,760
How many times have I died by Boulder?

779
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,140
Oh shit, wait!

780
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,060
Oh, I think it went back to the beginning.

781
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,940
I think so, I think so.

782
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,260
Oh my god, I'm gonna pass out, dude.

783
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,320
Throw!

784
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,380
Damn it.

785
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,120
Yo!

786
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,940
Okay, it's a little heavier than I thought it would be.

787
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,520
Yea, yeah, yeah, you got it.

788
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,420
Okay, move.

789
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,240
Throw!

790
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,260
Okay.

791
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,840
Grab it.

792
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,260
Grab it!

793
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,520
Wait, wait.

794
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,640
I thought you were gonna cry.

795
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:55,530
What?

796
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,710
Okay, okay, okay, I'll see you.

797
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,310
I'll see you here.

798
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:57,850
I'll see you here.

799
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,410
Okay.

800
00:40:59,690 --> 00:40:59,890
Okay.

801
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,670
And then I grab it and I throw it.

802
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

803
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:03,830
There we go.

804
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:04,390
Yay!

805
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:04,990
There we go.

806
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,690
Oh, sorry I threw out a frog again.

807
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,950
You're like puking frogs.

808
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,750
What is this thing?

809
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,290
I know.

810
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,490
What is this thing?

811
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:12,770
Oh!

812
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,130
Oh!

813
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,190
Oh, we can ride it?

814
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,610
We can ride him.

815
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,610
Oh, you can go on spikes!

816
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,290
Oh!

817
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,770
Wait, this is huge!

818
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:22,430
Ah!

819
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,170
Ah!

820
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,110
Ah!

821
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,970
Alright guys!

822
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:28,830
Oops!

823
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,530
There are you!

824
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,390
Nice aim!

825
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,150
Thanks!

826
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,790
Is pixel perfect?

827
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,670
Oops.

828
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:38,890
What?

829
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:39,650
It's gracious!

830
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,370
Oh,

831
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,530
dude, they come to you when you cry for help.

832
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

833
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,130
Wait, you can't jump though.

834
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,890
Yeah, you have to like...

835
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,570
Wait, how do they...

836
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,210
Oh, I think.

837
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,890
Just like that.

838
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,710
Did we miss anything?

839
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,350
I feel like we definitely did.

840
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,150
I'm gonna go back up.

841
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,450
Okay.

842
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,170
You think so?

843
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,430
Oh, we did miss something.

844
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,650
We did miss something at the end.

845
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,330
I'm getting sandwiched!

846
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,330
I got it!

847
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,290
Good job!

848
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,090
Good job!

849
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,630
I got it.

850
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,750
I'm just down here.

851
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,330
Oh, you're getting sandwiched.

852
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,990
Let me alone.

853
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,590
Let me alone.

854
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,130
Ah!

855
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,960
You good?

856
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,100
Yeah, I'm fine.

857
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:31,940
Kill that guy.

858
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,660
Kill that guy.

859
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,500
I'm killing him.

860
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,860
Oh, and yourself.

861
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,460
Stop!

862
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,820
Stop!

863
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,960
I'm not trying, dude.

864
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,640
Go away!

865
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,020
Okay!

866
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,680
She hates me, you guys.

867
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,900
It's sweet.

868
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,100
You got...

869
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,700
Oh, what?

870
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,320
Wait, what are we supposed to do here?

871
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,000
How are we supposed to get the...

872
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:55,960
The...

873
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,480
The thingy?

874
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,380
I don't know.

875
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,360
Also up here.

876
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,360
Okay.

877
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,460
Okay.

878
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,520
Okay.

879
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:06,920
Oops.

880
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,900
Oh my god.

881
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:08,660
Okay.

882
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,200
No.

883
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:13,780
Okay.

884
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,740
Okay, jump off of me.

885
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,820
Okay.

886
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,460
Yeah, we got all of them!

887
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
Yeah, we didn't get the yarn.

888
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,740
Yeah, try and get the yarn.

889
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,440
How are you supposed to get the yarn, though?

890
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,100
Oh my god!

891
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,700
Oh, oh, oh!

892
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,480
You're so close!

893
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,520
You're so close!

894
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,720
Oops.

895
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,840
Oh!

896
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Oh!

897
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,340
Okay, I think you boosted me.

898
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:42,660
Yeah!

899
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,960
Oh, guys, I don't think we're making the speedrun record.

900
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,280
What are you talking about?

901
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,020
They're literally writing our names up right now.

902
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,800
Oh, true, true, true.

903
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

904
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,940
Oh, my God.

905
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,660
I forgot there's, like, glasses and stuff in this.

906
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,600
Well, yeah, we'll shave off a lot of time with our boss time because we'll be so good at the bosses.

907
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,580
Yeah, exactly.

908
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,520
If there are bosses.

909
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,140
Yeah.

910
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,440
Okay, come, come, come.

911
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,900
Yeah, yeah.

Don't.

00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,220
Thank you.

916
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,440
I always trusted you.

917
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,060
I never, I never, I never doubted you for a second.

918
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,600
Never doubt me.

919
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,620
Never doubt me.

920
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,980
Is there a secret?

922
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,040
There's gotta be.

923
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:29,700
Oh, oops.

924
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,760
Uh-oh, I don't have any wings anymore.

925
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:34,720
Ah.

926
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:37,800
Uh-oh.

You probably...

930
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,920
I mean, you need to press the switch at the bottom to...

931
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,980
Oh, that's what those do.

932
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,400
Okay, here.

933
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,220
Yeah.

934
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,800

00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,350
Okay, I'm drinking water.

00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,710
I'm no longer dying.

949
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,470
You can get up here on your own, right?

950
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:24,950
Yeah.

951
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:25,770
Okay.

952
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:26,970
Oh, there we go.

953
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,750
Alright, don't die.

954
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,610
Actually, I think I'm...

Okay, okay, okay.

1020
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,680
Let's try the other side.

1021
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,180
Let's try.

1022
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:56,780
Okay.

1023
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,760
I'm gonna launch you.

1024
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:58,980
Okay, let's try.

1025
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,540
Let's go back to the main plan.

1026
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,780
Okay, okay, okay.

1027
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,680
Okay, okay, okay.

1028
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,300
Okay, okay, okay.

1029
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,480
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:06,920
Okay.

00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,520
Oh, and shit.

1032
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,120
Okay, you're good.

1033
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oops.

1034
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,040
I think we go back now, maybe?

1035
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,220
Oh, yeah, probably do.

1036
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1037
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:21,880
The other side is open.

1038
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,380
All right.

1039
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:23,400
Hoi.

1040
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:24,760
Hoi.

1041
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,880
Oh, we're so back.

1042
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,360
Okay.

1043
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,480
We are so- Why did you do that?

1044
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,420
Why is this- Well, why- that's so suspicious, isn't it?

1045
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,980
Oh, you're right.

1046
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,180
I don't see anything there, though.

1047
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,860
Yeah, maybe not.

1048
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:39,580
Thank you.

1049
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,680
This is really dangerous.

1050
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,760
Okay, don't worry.

1051
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,140
And there's a...

1052
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,040
There's a little guy... there's a gemmy.

1053
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,040
I'm gonna launch you.

1054
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,100
Okay, launch me.

1055
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,640
I told you I don't want to get launched anymore.

1056
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,740
I have pixel perfect aim.

1057
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,440
I don't think you see it.

1058
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,280
I die by grenade, you die by...

1059
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,440
I'm scared.

1060
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,530
Okay, I got rid of him, though.

1061
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:17,390
Oh, good job, good job.

1062
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:18,630
Yeah, we're good.

1063
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:20,810
Oh, okay.

1064
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:21,730
Let me out.

1065
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,350
You know, we're playing a team game.

1066
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.

1067
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,570
This is a team game.

1068
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,630
This is not...

1069
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,690
This is co-op, if you guys can believe it.

1070
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:34,650
Oh!

1071
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:35,670
Oh!

1072
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:36,390
Oh!

1073
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:39,710
Oh!

1074
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:40,610
Oh, what the heck?

1075
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,890
What the?

1076
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:42,850
Kill him!

1077
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:43,890
Oh.

1078
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:44,930
Kill!

1079
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,370
Kill, kill, kill!

1080
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,900
Um, I'm gonna launch you.

1081
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,320
No, I'm gonna launch you.

1082
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:53,580
Oh.

1083
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,180
No.

1084
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,960
I'm gonna launch you.

1085
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,240
Okay, launch me.

1086
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,920
See?

1087
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,300
Oh my god, it worked!

1088
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,280
Oh, and then you...

1089
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:05,640
Drop it.

1090
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1091
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,080
Okay, okay, okay.

1092
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,680
Uh, yeah.

1093
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,900
Come on.

1094
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,320
Thank you.

1095
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,260
Wait, is this the way we go?

1096
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,060
I guess so.

1097
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,280
How do we get through, though?

1098
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,260
How do we...

1099
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,600
I don't think we go this way.

1100
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:24,820
Uh...

1101
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,400
But then how do we get the...

1102
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,000
I think down here, down here, maybe?

1103
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,840
Hold on.

1104
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,960
Hold on, I have an idea.

1105
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,240
Okay.

1106
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,460
Oh, wait.

1107
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,440
I don't want you.

1108
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,440
Don't launch you.

1109
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,240
I don't think that's gonna work.

1110
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,160
I don't think that's gonna work.

1111
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:48,900
Never mind.

1112
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,640
It worked.

1113
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,100
My plan failed.

1114
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,340
Oh, wait.

1115
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,140
Was this open before?

1116
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,080
No, it wasn't.

1117
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,140
Ah!

1118
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,380
You have to distract him!

1119
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,060
Okay, I have to distract him!

1120
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,100
Okay, I have to distract him!

1121
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,080
You're just so tasty!

1122
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,160
Oh, wait, what is this?

1123
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,080
Oh, and then, and then...

1124
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,520
We call him.

1125
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,440
Oh, they come over!

1126
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,220
Help!

1127
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:12,840
Help!

1128
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,400
Wait, we can use them to get over to here.

1129
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,600
Through here.

1130
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,760
True, true, true, true.

1131
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,580
Okay.

1132
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,380
Oh, wait, but the...

1133
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:20,660
Hold on.

1134
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,540
There's also a yarn.

1135
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,800
Yeah, we gotta get the yarn.

1136
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,140
Wait.

1137
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,180
No, we can't.

1138
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,280
Uh, what's...

1139
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,820
Where's the...

1140
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,480
Oh, I see where the teleport is.

1141
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:31,780
Where?

1142
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,200
It's right...

1143
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,080
Oh, okay, hold on.

1144
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,180
Oh, it was a secret!

1145
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,260
Yeah, it was a secret.

1146
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,360
Oh.

1147
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,160
We got this, guys.

1148
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:39,780
We got this.

1149
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,400
Okay, you go get it.

1150
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,480
I'll...

1151
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,960
I'll stay near the spot.

1152
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,380
Okay.

1153
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:44,860
Okay.

1154
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,540
Oh, wait, no.

1155
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,440
Maybe you need my help, though.

1156
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,180
No, I don't think so.

1157
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,000
I think you need me.

1158
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,560
I think you need me.

1159
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
Oh, I do need you.

1160
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,780
Oh, say that again.

1161
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,740
I can't fly this plane without by myself.

1162
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,220
Okay.

1163
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:02,900
Okay.

1164
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,040
Yeah!

1165
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,300
Oh!

1166
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:06,500
Oh!

1167
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,180
Oh, you got this.

1168
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:09,560
There you go.

1169
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,080
There you go.

1170
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,140
Okay.

1171
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:11,960
All right.

1172
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,140
Now we can leave.

1173
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,960
Now we can go.

1174
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,120
Oops.

1175
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:16,760
Oops.

1176
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,020
Oops.

1177
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,340
Indeed.

1178
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:18,880
Okay.

1179
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,680
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1180
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,080
Wait me.

1181
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,340
No, I'm coming!

1182
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:24,340
Please!

1183
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,580
Don't leave me behind!

1184
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,100
Ah.

1185
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,520
Alright.

1186
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,320
Yay!

1187
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,660
Oh my god, everything.

1188
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,100
Yippee!

1189
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,540
I survived rabies!

1190
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,680
Yeah, we all survived rabies.

1191
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,080
Wait, I want to go to the store.

1192
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:43,880
Yeah, me too.

1193
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,180
Unless you want to go to the store, maybe.

1194
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,860
Yeah, okay, okay.

1195
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,120
Let's go.

1196
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:47,880
Oh, oh.

1197
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,520
Wait, sorry?

1198
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,180
Wrong button, wrong button.

1199
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,840
I have 38 jemmies.

1200
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,040
Which one is the...

1201
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,320
Oh!

1202
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,240
10?

1203
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,780
Yeah.

1204
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,020
I want to use a square.

1205
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,380
I want to go into the square.

1206
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:03,920
Square.

1207
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,120
Be there, and she's square.

1208
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:07,960
TV!

1209
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,040
Wow!

1210
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,620
Okay.

1211
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,900
Oh, that's it.

1212
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,500
That's all I have.

1213
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:17,880
Okay.

1214
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
I'm gonna try to.

1215
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,360
Okay, okay.

1216
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,800
Angory.

1217
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,460
Okay.

1218
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,220
That's good if you didn't survive rabies.

1219
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,740
That's like a chupacabra.

1220
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,260
That's like a chupacabra.

1221
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,340
That's a regular iguana.

1222
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,560
No, that's a porcupine, isn't it?

1223
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,680
I don't know.

1224
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,380
Wait, how much are these?

1225
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,620
Five?

1226
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,820
Oh, I have four.

1227
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:46,660
What do you have?

1228
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,880
Oh, I have five.

1229
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,720
Did you just get a golf ball?

1230
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,900
Yeah, what is that?

1231
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:52,620
Wait, hold on.

1232
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,020
What the hell?

1233
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,580
You're playing games.

1234
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,640
Wait, that's it.

1235
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,060
Oh.

1236
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,260
Oh, sorry.

1237
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,960
Wait, that's it.

1238
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,940
It's only... It's nothing.

1239
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,060
I can't even interact with it.

1240
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:08,600
Oh, yes, I can!

1241
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,480
It's just a bouncy ball.

1242
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,000
I just got a bouncy ball.

1243
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,820
Yeah, but we can play catch with it.

1244
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,740
Okay, catch.

1245
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,360
Oh.

1246
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,680
All right, let's go.

1247
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,580
No, I don't know if I can detonate it.

1248
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,500
I think it's just...

1249
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:36,940
Oh my god.

1250
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,680
Oh my god.

1251
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:38,680
Oh my god.

1252
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,340
Oh my god.

1253
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:39,720
Oh my god.

1254
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:39,860
Oh my god.

1255
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,020
Oh my god.

1256
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,400
Oh my god.

1257
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,660
Very bug.

1258
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,940
You're really dragging down the morale.

1259
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,340
No, my morale is at an all-time high.

1260
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:51,680
Yay!

1261
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:52,540
Yay!

1262
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,920
Shall we find some sparkly gems?

1263
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:56,920
Sparkly gems.

1264
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:57,660
All right.

1265
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,820
Sparkly gems.

1266
00:54:59,140 --> 00:54:59,180
Oh!

1267
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,900
Oh, there's a secret!

1268
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,600
We must follow the secret.

1269
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,420
Do we follow this guy?

1270
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,060
I think so.

1271
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,080
It seems like we do, right?

1272
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,960
He's like going up?

1273
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,920
Or wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1274
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,480
Yeah, no, I think you're right there.

1275
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:12,620
Oh.

1276
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,280
Oh, wait, hold on.

1277
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,160
You go, and then I'll go.

1278
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,220
Okay.

1279
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,120
There you go.

1280
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,580
Okay.

1281
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
This just seems like the way to progress.

1282
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:23,740
Oh, yeah, I think.

1283
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,160
So.

1284
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,400
Oh, oh.

1285
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,760
Wait, it's supposed to be down here?

1286
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:32,560
Oh!

1287
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,100
Keeping lucky.

1288
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,680
Thank you for the raid.

1289
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,420
Thank you for the raid on Twitch.

1290
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,900
Thank you for the raid!

1291
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,840
I'm gonna die.

1292
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,080
Oh, wait, we need the boulder here.

1293
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,280
To block it.

1294
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,680
Right?

1295
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,920
Oh, oh, no.

1296
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,420
Wait.

1297
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,460
Wait, should we restart?

1298
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,520
How do we...

1299
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,400
Oh, is that the restart?

1300
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,400
If you... if we both do the left one?

1301
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,020
Or... Is that it?

1302
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,160
I don't know what this is.

1303
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,240
I don't know what this is either.

1304
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,620
What is that?

1305
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,280
Oh!

1306
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,680
Wait, I have a... Oh, I have an option.

1307
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,700
Maybe that's just...

1308
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1309
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,460
No, I did.

1310
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,900
All right, all right, all right.

1311
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,120
I won't just throw it down.

1312
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,360
Okay, okay.

1313
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1314
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,420
We know now.

1315
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:18,940
Yeah.

1316
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:20,740
Oops.

1317
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:21,580
Oops.

1318
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,300
Okay.

1319
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,360
Okay.

1320
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,980
Oh, shoot.

1321
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,320
Okay.

1322
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:25,780
My bad.

1323
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,120
Okay.

1324
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:26,320
Okay.

1325
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,280
I got it.

1326
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:34,480
Oh, why did I not mess?

1327
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,460
Oh, you got it.

1328
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:36,880
Okay.

1329
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,020
Okay.

1330
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,680
I got it.

1331
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:39,940
Ah.

1332
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,320
Oh, she gamed.

1333
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:42,840
Yeah.

1334
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,800
Nice.

1335
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,100
Okay.

1336
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:44,660
Okay.

1337
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,560
Have your ticket ready.

1338
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,640
Wait, is that it?

1339
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,560
Uh.

1340
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:51,940
Ah!

1341
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,000
There it is!

1342
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,820
That's it!

1343
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,000
Oh there it is!

1344
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:02,200
How do I get up here?

1345
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,380
Oh my gosh, here we go.

1346
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,680
Oh my god, oh my god.

1347
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,060
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

1348
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,460
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

1349
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:09,600
Bye bye.

1350
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,780
Bye bye.

1351
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,020
Oh shit.

1352
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,300
Is that it?

1353
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:28,900
Is that everything?

1354
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,140
No, there's a gold.

1355
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,640
There's a...

1356
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,600
There's a...

1357
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
I gotta get the...

1358
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,460
Yeah, how do I...

1359
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,080
How do you...

1360
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:35,440
There you go!

1361
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:35,980
Oh, there you go.

1362
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,600
Okay, okay.

1363
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,060
Is that it?

1364
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:37,720
No, there's more.

1365
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,040
There's gotta be more.

1366
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:41,900
Oh god.

1367
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:42,900
Oh god.

1368
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,670
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1369
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:47,990
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

1370
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,230
I got it!

1371
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:50,630
Nice!

1372
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,330
Yay!

1373
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,410
We got all of it!

1374
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:01,730
That was...

1375
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:02,610
That was insanity.

1376
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,430
Yeah, they're so fucking chaotic.

1377
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,150
It's time too!

1378
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,060
I'm gonna redo this.

1379
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:13,520
Yeah.

1380
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,820
Yeah, I guess we do.

1381
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,140
Ah, mean.

1382
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,020
Ah, mean.

1383
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:20,940
Alright.

1384
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,800
Okay, ignore that guy.

1385
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:23,840
Ignore him.

1386
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,900
Yeah, ignore that guy.

1387
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,300
Freak that guy, man.

1388
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,020
Oh, wait, but this gemmy here.

1389
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,840
Okay, I'll get it, and then I'll die.

1390
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,800
Yeah, just...

1391
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,280
Okay, die.

1392
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,100
Okay, I die.

1393
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,260
And then we can just move on.

1394
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,420
Yeah, now we can keep going.

1395
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,640
Okay.

1396
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,100
Okay.

1397
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,040
Oh.

1398
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,360
Okay.

1399
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,660
I thought there might be a secret up there, but...

1400
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,460
There was not.

1401
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,700
Oh, wait.

1402
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,400
Ah!

1403
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1404
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,680
The thing is over there.

1405
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,520
Oh, oh, you see, I see, I see.

1406
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:58,460
Wait.

1407
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,500
Is that good enough?

1408
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,780
Can you get it with that?

1409
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:03,520
Um...

1410
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:04,740
No.

1411
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,220
Well, I messed up.

1412
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,080
Yeah, you can.

1413
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,460
Yeah, yeah.

1414
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:09,940
I got it.

1415
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:10,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1416
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,980
You can climb out there.

1417
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,400
Oopsie.

1418
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,520
Yeah, we're fine.

1419
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,800
Alright, we'll just climb back here.

1420
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,000
Yeah, whatever, whatever, man.

1421
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,200
Okay, I'll press this.

1422
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,120
Okay, go grab that and kill that guy.

1423
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:23,960
Yeah.

1424
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,040
Oh, hi.

1425
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,180
Okay.

1426
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,300
And then...

1427
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:29,880
Oh, okay, nice.

1428
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,480
Nice.

1429
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,060
Okay.

1430
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,030
Get this guy out of here.

1431
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,250
Oh, oh, oh.

1432
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:39,210
Okay.

1433
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,910
I'm so strong.

1434
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,050
You are so strong.

1435
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:42,930
I'm so brave.

1436
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:43,550
I'm so strong.

1437
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,590
We're doing it.

1438
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:44,930
I'm so strong.

1439
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,150
Oh, I didn't even notice that.

1440
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,510
Okay, that's all the gems, I think.

1441
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,030
Oh, yeah, it was.

1442
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,270
Actually, this is the exit.

1443
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:50,670
Was it?

1444
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,250
Okay, okay, okay.

1445
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:53,170
Yeah, we're good, right?

1446
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,030
Yeah, I think so.

1447
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

1448
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,570
I think?

1449
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:57,190
Right?

1450
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:58,490
Yeah.

1451
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:06,710
I mean, did you do your homework from last time and listen to the song that I recommended you?

1452
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,590
Almost.

1453
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,250
What was it again?

1454
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:14,010
Uh, the, the, the, the FNAF song I recommended you.

1455
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:15,610
Yes, I did.

1456
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,610
How did you think about it?

1457
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,350
I don't remember.

1458
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:26,810
It was just so good that it shocked your system that you forgot it.

1459
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:27,270
Yeah.

1460
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:28,970
Yeah, yeah.

1461
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,490
I don't remember, actually.

1462
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:32,310
Oh, shoot.

1463
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,830
My name is Edwin, and I made the mimic.

1464
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,130
Oh, keep going.

1465
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:41,470
It was difficult to put the pieces together.

1466
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:44,450
Sorry.

1467
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,550
Oh, sorry.

1468
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,450
Okay, maybe you time it better.

1469
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:51,290
Very...

1470
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,010
Okay, okay, okay.

1471
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,270
There you go.

1472
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:55,330
Is that good?

1473
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,670
Or...

1474
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:56,870
Yep.

1475
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,030
Yeah.

1476
01:00:58,990 --> 01:00:59,810
We're fine.

1477
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:00,910
Go, go!

1478
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,660
Okay, we can't...

1479
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,880
There's two of ones!

1480
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:06,660
Okay.

1481
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,840
Oh, let's see.

1482
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,960
This looks like a whole lot of fun.

1483
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,300
You...

1484
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,120
What about...

1485
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,080
You didn't like the...

1486
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,140
My name is Jackie.

1487
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,000
And I'm fucking backy.

1488
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,520
I don't know why I don't remember this song.

1489
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,580
Like, I do, but I don't.

1490
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,440
You like actually blocked it from your number.

1491
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,340
I think I did.

1492
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,080
Wait, I think I need your help.

1493
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,000
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

1494
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,720
It's like a fan.

1495
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,520
Send me over!

1496
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:33,240
Ah!

1497
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:33,720
Yeah!

1498
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,760
Okay, okay, stay there.

1499
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,620
Okay, okay, wait, hold on.

1500
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,600
I'm trying.

1501
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,580
Okay, hold on.

1502
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,100
Okay, hold on.

1503
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,240
Okay, okay.

1504
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,540
Okay, hold on.

1505
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,360
Okay, okay.

1506
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,260
You got this?

1507
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:44,800
Oh!

1508
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,100
Okay.

1509
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:46,640
It's good now.

1510
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:46,940
Okay.

1511
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:47,460
There we go.

1512
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:47,780
There we go.

1513
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:49,460
I think you're good.

1514
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:51,980
Maybe.

1515
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,140
Is that it over there?

1516
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,820
I think so.

1517
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,140
Okay.

1518
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,320
I killed him.

1519
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:58,800
Oh.

1520
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,600
Come on.

1521
01:01:59,700 --> 01:01:59,820
Oh.

1522
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:02,240
Oh.

1523
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:02,380
All right.

1524
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:02,800
You're good.

1525
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,500
We're fine.

1526
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,400
Everything's cool.

1527
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:04,960
All right.

1528
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:05,260
Chill.

1529
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:06,660
Okay.

1530
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,480
Wait, what is...

1531
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:07,940
Oh, there's a...

1532
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,040
The ball of yarn!

1533
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:09,880
Where?

1534
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,420
Down here?

1535
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,760
Oh, I see it.

1536
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:12,460
Over...

1537
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,160
Oh, wait, wait.

1538
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,800
Oh, so you hold that and then you...

1539
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,580
Okay, I go here.

1540
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,160
Oh, okay, okay.

1541
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,540
But what is this?

1542
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:19,900
What is...

1543
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:20,920
I don't know.

1544
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,380
It's a death trap.

1545
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,220
That's the way it is.

1546
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,860
I think you have to...

1547
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,360
Yeah, because staying on this makes it go up.

1548
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,840
So I think you have to...

1549
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,420
You have to get me to go up.

1550
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1551
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,040
And not die.

1552
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,680
Okay, I'll let you handle this.

1553
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,920
No, I think...

1554
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,900
I need your help timing.

1555
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:46,980
Oh!

1556
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,760
Well, why do we need it?

1557
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,160
How far?

1558
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,360
Oh, I guess because it...

1559
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,460
Why don't I just launch you?

1560
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:51,940
Come here.

1561
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,060
Okay, okay.

1562
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:54,440
Alright.

1563
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,180
Oh, okay.

1564
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:55,960
Okay.

1565
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,220
Um, there you go.

1566
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:57,920
Okay, hold on.

1567
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,700
Oh, that way.

1568
01:02:59,340 --> 01:02:59,480
No, wrong way.

1569
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:00,180
There we go.

1570
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,060
Okay, okay, okay.

1571
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,300
Right here is the way to do it.

1572
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:03,920
Okay, come on.

1573
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,280
Yeah.

1574
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:04,820
Okay, okay.

1575
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,320
Okay, let's time this.

1576
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:09,500
Okay.

1577
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,000
Oops.

1578
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:10,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1579
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,800
Hold on.

1580
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,320
Hold on.

1581
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:12,880
Okay, I saw her.

1582
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,340
I'm sorry.

1583
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:16,940
Okay.

1584
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:17,480
Okay.

1585
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,020
Okay.

1586
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:18,260
Okay.

1587
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,100
Oh, sorry.

1588
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:19,460
Okay.

1589
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:19,960
I turn.

1590
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:20,640
Okay.

1591
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:22,320
Oh, sorry.

1592
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:23,520
Okay.

1593
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,300
Wait, hold on.

1594
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,220
That was close though.

1595
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:25,760
That was close.

1596
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:26,500
That was close.

1597
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:27,140
Oh,

1598
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,020
wait, wait.

1599
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,840
Just stay up there.

1600
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,560
Just stay up there.

1601
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,720
You're so right!

1602
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,570
How do I get up there?

1603
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,830
Just kill yourself.

1604
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1605
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,650
Wait, I spawn down here again.

1606
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:56,210
Okay.

1607
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:58,170
What?

1608
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,910
Oh, there's nothing else up here!

1609
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:00,550
There's nothing!

1610
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,670
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1611
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:05,330
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

1612
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:06,590
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

1613
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,790
Oh god, the camera is...

1614
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:08,710
Oh my god!

1615
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,850
Why did it spawn me here?

1616
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:13,950
Why did you spawn there?

1617
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,250
Why did it spawn here too?

1618
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:18,550
Oh my god.

1619
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:19,530
Oh my god.

1620
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,150
Oh my god.

1621
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,070
I killed us both.

1622
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,430
I took us both out.

1623
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,210
Why does this exist?

1624
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,530
Why why does it exist, like.

1625
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,470
What the, what the?

1626
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:32,330
What the?

1627
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:32,570
What the?

1628
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:32,750
What the what the?

1629
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:34,270
What the what the?

1630
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:36,990
Oh no,

1631
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:42,290
no!

1632
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,730
Oh damn it!

1633
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:47,570
I lost the hat!

1634
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,290
Oh, oh, oh...

1635
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,050
Wait, hold on... You got the hat?

1636
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,730
No, I didn't get it.

1637
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:56,230
Wait, oh wait, it drowned!

1638
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:57,950
The hat drowned?

1639
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,590
No, stinking way.

1640
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:01,850
What the heck?

1641
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:03,250
No!

1642
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,260
Stop the violence!

1643
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,400
Stop the violence!

1644
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,800
Oh, you are!

1645
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,400
Oh, you are!

1646
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,260
Yeah, we were so close.

1647
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:26,740
It's okay.

1648
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,440
It's okay.

1649
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,420
I didn't like...

1650
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:29,700
What is this?

1651
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,280
Oh.

1652
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:32,800
Okay.

1653
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,020
This is a...

1654
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,340
Let's go.

1655
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,000
Oh wait, no.

1656
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:35,960
Is he staying on that?

1657
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,480
Yeah, he's staying on it.

1658
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:39,480
Okay.

1659
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,620
Maybe you should stay there.

1660
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,880
I think I should launch you.

1661
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:44,680
Oh, maybe.

1662
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,280
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,380
Like an actual, actually this time.

1664
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1665
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,600

Minto, Minto.

1667
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:55,920
Thank you.

1668

No!

1669
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,040
I'm setting you on fire.

1670
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,540
What the heck?

1671
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,860
Trick or treat?

1672
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,460
I only bring tricks.

1673
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,140
Wait, I'll use my...

1674
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:09,560

Dang it!

1676
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:24,050
I'll launch you.

1677
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:25,010
I'll launch you.

1678
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:26,470
Alright, okay, okay.

1679
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:27,910
Is it a launching?

1680
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,910
Actually, I don't know what this part is.

1681
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:31,270
Oh, okay.

1682
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:32,370
Go, go.

1683
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,770
I can just stand on your head.

1684
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:37,290
Oops.

1685
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,350
Oh, come on.

1686
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,290
Oh, maybe you can use that?

1687
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:42,950
Yeah, like...

1688
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:43,990
Oh, you could, yeah.

1689
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,850
Oh, I can!

1690
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,270
Yeah.

1691
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:49,170
Handy.

1692
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,530
Oh god, there's a...

1693
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:52,790

1694
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:55,410
Oops.

1695
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:57,970
Okay.

1696
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:00,170
Sorry, my bad.

1697
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,070
Oh, ouch.

1698
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:02,530
Oh.

1699
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:03,590
Ah!

1700
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:04,850
Okay.

1701
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,070
How did I die?

1702
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,170
I don't know.

1703
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:08,970
Me and Boulders?

1704
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,070
We don't really get a log, you guys.

1705
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,950
You're like a lunatune skipper.

1706
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,410
I think it's my controller.

1707
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,870
But, who knows?

1708
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:22,470
You're like wily coyote-ing yourself.

1709
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:26,550
What is this?

1710
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,690
Oh, we have to make it match.

1711
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:28,290
There we go.

1712
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:29,250
Oh, nah, okay, okay.

1713
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,310
Oh, I thought I died.

1714
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:30,970
Oh, I did.

1715
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:33,930
Oh, no.

1716
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,530
Wait, where have I...

1717
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:35,730
Oh!

1718
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,190
Fuck you.

1719
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:41,430
Get out of here!

1720
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:42,910
Yeah, kill him!

1721
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:44,250
Kill him!

1722
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:45,310
There you go.

1723
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,050
Oh, that was close.

1724
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:49,510
Yeah, turn it off.

1725
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,250
Did you miss anything?

1726
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,130
No, but I'm gonna go up here.

1727
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:54,230
I feel like there's... Oh, maybe there's nothing.

1728
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:54,770
Just kidding.

1729
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:55,710
Maybe there's nothing.

1730
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:57,750
Okay.

1731
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,170
Whoa!

1732
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:02,430
Be careful.

1733
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:03,410
Be careful.

1734
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,170
Oh, wait!

1735
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,030
Up there!

1736
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,190
Oh, oh, oh!

1737
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,170
Wait, I think I have to go back through it.

1738
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,210
I gotta go through it!

1739
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:10,810
Wait, wait, what?

1740
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,050
You think so?

1741
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,670
I don't think so.

1742
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:12,950
Oh, hello.

1743
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,150

1749
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:25,030
Why?

1750
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:26,890
Okay, let me know what?

01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,340
It opens up right here.

1845
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,440
On the left.

1846
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,480
Oh, sorry.

01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,200
Wait, how are you supposed to do this?

01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:12,560
Okay.

1849
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,720
I'll keep blowing them up.

1850
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,800
I'll keep blowing them up.

1851
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,540
I don't think you blow them up.

1852
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,160
I think we're supposed to use the...

1853
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,340
We're supposed to put it on it.

1854
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,880
Oh, I think so.

1855
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:23,520
You're right.

1856
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:24,820
Okay.

1857
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,440
Okay.

1858
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,580
And then get on the next one.

1859
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,240
Oh, no, no.

1860
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,260
Sorry, I fireballed.

1861
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,100
You fireballed.

1862
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,040
Okay.

1863
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:36,780
Okay.

1864
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:36,920
Okay.

1865
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,580
Well, let it grow.

1866
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,140
Let it grow.

1867
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,520
Let it grow.

1868
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:40,840
Okay.

1869
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,520
Let it go.

1870
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,560
There we go.

1871
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:44,900
There we go.

1872
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:44,960
There we go.

1873
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:45,600
30 seconds.

1874
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:46,520
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1875
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:52,740
Nice, nice.

1876
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,060
Keep going.

1877
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,990
Oh, we're fine.

1878
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,270
Okay, okay, we're fine.

1879
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,830
No, we're not fine.

1880
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:03,590
Well, I'm okay.

1881
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,110
I'll be okay.

1882
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,450
I'm just, I'm continuing.

1883
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:06,750
Yeah, just keep going.

1884
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:07,190
Keep going.

1885
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:07,710
Keep going without me.

1886
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:08,410
I'm going.

1887
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:10,050
I'm sandwiched.

1888
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:11,730
Okay.

1889
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:12,750
Wait, there's a ball there.

1890
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:16,100
Can you, it's at the bottom.

1891
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:16,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1892
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,400
I got it.

1893
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,380
Okay, you got it.

1894
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:19,960
Okay, we're going.

1895
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:20,320
Okay.

1896
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,120
Oh, that is not a good block to remove.

1897
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:31,320
Okay.

1898
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:31,860
Wait.

1899
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,980
How do you do this?

1900
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,260
Oh, I'll stand on your head and then- Oh, there you go.

1901
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:36,400
Yeah.

1902
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,560
I'll go this way.

1903
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:38,800
And then...

1904
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,880
And then now you go down.

1905
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,000
Oh, okay, okay.

1906
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:43,800
Okay.

1907
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:44,680
And then...

1908
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,160
And then now you can go...

1909
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:47,700
Uh...

1910
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,120
Nowhere.

1911
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:49,800
No...

1912
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,360
No, where.

1913
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,260
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,560
Don't step on that.

1915
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,220
Don't step on that.

1916
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:56,640

1919
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,320
Wait, there's another.

1920
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,400
Oh, you got it.

Oh, what the freak?

1923
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,700
Oh, you're supposed to go there.

1924
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,040
Um, I'm already here.

1925
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:39,780
You're supposed to go there.

1926
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:40,280
Oh, okay.

1927
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:41,800
Okay, okay.

01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,900
Now, now.

1929
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,720
I feel like there's something down here, though.

1930
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,320
Oh, a boulder?

1931
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,100
Maybe?

1932
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,560
We got a boulder, yeah.

1933
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:49,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1934
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,260
Okay.

1935
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:53,720
Uh.

1936
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,060
Okay.

1937
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:55,480
Yeah.

1938
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:55,860
Up.

1939
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:56,900
Okay.

1940
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:57,660
going up?

1941
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,220
Yeah.

1942
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,520
What does that do?

1943
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,000
Oh, I was supposed to throw it!

1944
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,360
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1945
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,780
You got it, you got it, you got it.

1946
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:04,920
Oh, oh, no, wait, hold on.

1947
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,240
Okay.

1948
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,440
Don't trust me.

1949
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:08,920
It's okay, it's okay.

1950
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,360
Oh, okay, now I'm gonna... Oh, my God!

1951
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,040
Oh, my God.

1952
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:12,760
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1953
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,360
Okay, okay.

1954
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,620
It's gonna go up here.

1955
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,440
Can you get to...

1956
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,680
My, my trigger...

1957
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,580
My... I don't... Don't trust me with the boulder.

1958
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:24,940
Don't trust me.

1959
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,360
My trigger is... It's out.

1960
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,140
It's sabotaging.

1961
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,180
Wait, wait, wait, you gotta go!

1962
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:28,880
Wait, hold on.

1963
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:29,720
Can you...

1964
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,940
Yeah, yeah, nice, nice, nice!

1965
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:31,540
Nice!

1966
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:33,460
Okay!

1967
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:34,640
You got it!

1968
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,200
Okay, nice, nice!

1969
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,180
Okay, we have to rush, we have to rush.

1970
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1971
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:39,520
Just go.

1972
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:41,520
Just go.

1973
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:42,480
Just go!

1974
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:43,780
Just go!

1975
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,080
Just go!

1976
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,660
Go, go, just go!

1977
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:48,580
Just go!

1978
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,520
I got it!

1979
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,160
Oh my god!

1980
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:54,420
Let's go!

1981
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:56,420
Oh my god!

1982
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:56,880
Oh my god!

1983
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:58,960
That was awesome!

1984
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,580
Oh, I don't even know what happened.

1985
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:08,420
Take my dainty hand as I wish you back to a time long forgotten.

1986
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,500
Long before the poop hit the fan here.

1987
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:16,000
The year was 17, oh, 59-ish, whatever.

1988
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:21,200
Self-made billionaire, cat fanatic, and theatrics officiato Perham Furbottom.

1989
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,680
Perham Furbottom.

1990
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,420
Ritsiest, most thrill-inducingest theater ever.

1991
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,220
And you did.

1992
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,100
And it was the talk of the town.

1993
01:16:29,580 --> 01:17:29,080
Titanic went there you are most assuredly square Wow seriously like what you weren't there what are you a nerd opening night was a thing to hear the square organized the grandest jaw-dropping ever seen there was explosions dancing girls dancing girls who exploded oh my god exotic animals who exploded incredible feats of magic and wonder with fantastic production values all around for days on end marveling at his breathtaking creation and packing handful of delicious buttery popcorn I like a popcorn but alas his logical contempt for intermissions ultimately caused his demise during the show Furbottom passed what having pooped himself to death on the way to the bathroom legend I was like did he get Abraham Lincoln but his little cheeks just gave out Furbottom left nothing behind why did he how did he poop himself more like poop bottom and of course his bloated course which was lovingly drifted out of the sea and immediately ravaged by sharks and that children is the legend of Purham

1994
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:29,880
Furbottom bottom.

1995
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,080
What a way to go.

1996
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,840
Apparently delicious, a gentleman.

1997
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,680
But the show must go on, right?

1998
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,220
Right.

1999
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:38,460
For thousands of years, Perham's hat passed from head to head.

2000
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,360
Leader to leader.

2001
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,020
And the theater still operates to this very day.

2002
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,180
And what a piece of crap it's become.

2003
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,940
I bet Perham is rolling over in his sharks right now.

2004
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,320
I mean, everything's poorly run and the whole place stinks like pee in feet.

2005
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:54,440
And with everyone involved walking a fine line between moodiness and furblown insanity.

2006
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,180
It's only a matter of time before something truly horrifying happens.

2007
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:32,660
disposition as you sink further into darkness yeah nobody likes a cry baby so so haddy is possessed by a ghost of we're glitched together i don't why are you saying it like that i forgot how many chapters are there naked oh yeah he took off all his clothes i know it looks like the next one is maybe the end like maybe there's five and then six and then maybe that's the end He is just like the people on Everest.

2008
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,280
What are you saying?

2009
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:42,700
You know, you start going crazy, you hallucinate, you take off your clothes, you walk off the edge.

2010
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,540
Oh my god.

2011
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,240
Hold on, I gotta blow my nose.

2012
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,180
I'm so sorry.

2013
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,480
It's okay, blow it into my ear.

2014
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,000
Okay, let me find my tissues.

2015
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,840
Okay, okay, I'll mute Discord so they don't get to hear.

2016
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,740
Yeah, you guys don't get to hear.

2017
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,620
Hold on.

2018
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,700
Yeah, only I get to hear.

2019
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:07,080
Come to Phantom Channel to hear me blow my nose.

2020
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:07,960
I'm not muting.

2021
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:08,960
No, no, no, no, no.

2022
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,000
Mute on OBS.

2023
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:10,880
Mute on OBS.

2024

There is a secret.

2122
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,880
I was so distracted by the Mario game.

2123
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:03,700
I got so excited.

2124
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:04,900
That's understandable.

2125
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,360
Wait, did I drop that?

2126
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,080

2127
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,400
Or I don't know how.

2128
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:12,460
Or maybe...

2129
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,640
Oh, oh, is that how I come over?

2130
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:15,980

2132
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,040
But why is there...

2133
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:19,960

2135
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,180

2136
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,380
Oh, maybe you take it out.

2137
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,120
Oh, yeah, I think you take it out.

2138
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,000
I don't think you can take it out.

2139
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,780

2140
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,240

01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:43,680
Okay.

2207
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,400
Okay.

2208
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:46,880
Oh!

2209
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,400
Yeah, but I don't think I reach.

2210
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,000
Yeah.

2211
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,260
I need it.

2212
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:51,660
I need it.

2213
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:52,160
Okay, hold on.

2214
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:53,500
Hold on.

2215
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,480
Yeah, yeah, come on.

2216
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:56,420
Okay.

2217
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,280
Die again.

2218
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,020
Yeah, die again.

2219
01:26:59,140 --> 01:26:59,580
Just die.

2220
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,600
What if it's not even here?

2221
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,260
It has to be.

2222
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:02,640
Wait, maybe?

2223
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:08,240
Oh!

2224
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:09,320
She was gaming!

2225
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:10,660
Wait.

2226
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:11,420
Where is it?

2227
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:11,760
Oh!

2228
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,560
The music is not the music.

2229
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,660
We're used to.

2230
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:21,060
Come on.

2231
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:25,000
I think it's different between the stages.

2232
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,280
Oh my god, this one's hard.

2233
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,980
Oh my, this is, wait, this is actual parkour.

2234
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:31,060
Oh my god, wait, I can't get anything.

2235
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:32,680
Wait, this sucks.

2236
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:33,520
This kind of sucks.

2237
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:34,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2238
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:35,680
Wait, oh you did it?

2239
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,660
Oh, okay, nice.

2240
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2241
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,360
There's so many though.

2242
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:39,960
Oh my god, I know.

2243
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:41,740
Wait.

2244
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:45,180
How the heck am I supposed to time?

2245
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,400
This, uh...

2246
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,340
I'm sorry.

2247
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,120
I'm so sorry.

2248
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:51,740
I'm so sorry.

2249
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,880
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

2250
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,060
I wanna get it, can I get the ball at least maybe?

2251
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,420
How are you standing on ones that don't exist?

2252
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,560
You just guess the timing.

2253
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,080
I'm sorry, I messed up.

2254
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,540
Three gems is still three gems.

2255
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:13,260
Three gems is still three gems.

2256
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,040
How are we feeling?

2257
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,680
We have to redo this one though, don't we?

2258
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,680
We don't have to actually.

2259
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,820
I think we, I feel like we got a majority of the, we were like close to the end.

2260
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:21,400
You're right.

2261
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,180
Okay.

2262
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,000
Wait, actually, maybe we should redo it, because I don't know if it counts any of the gems that we do.

2263
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,180
That's what I was wondering.

2264
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:31,680
Yeah.

2265
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,240
Okay, maybe we should redo that.

2266
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,320
Go back and redo that.

2267
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:34,560
Oh.

2268
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,880
Really fantastic timing there.

2269
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:38,240
Okay.

2270
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,200
I'm coming.

2271
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:46,900
Sorry.

2272
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:48,060
Oh, my gosh.

2273
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,020
Yeah, get him, get him, get him.

2274
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:52,480
Feed him up.

2275
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,440
And wait, that was me.

2276
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,360
My bad.

2277
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,560
Oh, X.

2278
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:55,860
Okay.

2279
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:27,260

Yeah, you gotta beat, yeah, okay, good job.

2282
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:30,900
You got it, you got it.

2283
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,180
Alright.

2284
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:50,480
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, wait, what if I said no?

2285
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:51,580
Wait, there's two of them.

2286
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,960
I would try.

2287
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:53,940
Wait, why are there two of them?

2288
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,040
There's, there's two of them?

2289
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,400
Wait, I'm actually stuck, I'm like, I can't...

2290
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,880
I can't stop making love to this machine.

2291
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:00,560
Wait.

2292
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,340
Why did you...

2293
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,400
Why should you say it like that?

2294
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,240
I don't know why I can't let go!

2295
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,400
Wait, I can't let go!

2296
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,020
I actually...

2297
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:08,700
Let go!

2298
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:09,500
Let go!

2299
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,240
Wait!

2300
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,940
I still have it!

2301
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,240
Why is it like this?

2302
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:34,120
I'm gonna stop making love to her!

2303
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:37,460
Wait!

2304
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:43,960
I still...

2305
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:44,560
It's

2306
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,360
like a little tiny dog and a stuffed animal.

2307
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,860
I can't stop.

2308
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:02,210
Mint has so many...

2309
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:05,530
She has so much invisible burden on her.

2310
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:08,470
What do I do with it?

2311
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:09,150
What do I do?

2312
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:09,910
What's going on?

2313
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:11,610
Do we have to reset the lobby?

2314
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:12,790
I don't know.

2315
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:14,370
Hold on, let me leave.

2316
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:15,970
No, it's still happening.

2317
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:21,390
Maybe we should reset the lobby.

2318
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,910
We'll reset the...

2319
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,710
Jump on my block.

2320
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:31,970
Jump on my block.

2321
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:33,390
Jump on my block.

2322
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,010
I can't even punch you.

2323
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:39,870
Yeah, I'm invincible.

2324
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:41,930
Wait, this might be game-breaking.

2325
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:44,310
Like, what if I can...

2326
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:45,190
Yeah, for real.

2327
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:49,010
What if I can get through everything because I have an extra block?

2328
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:51,710
Oh, it's lagging.

2329
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:53,690
Is it also lagging, like, crazy on your side?

2330
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:57,670
It's not lagging, though.

2331
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:00,110
I'm just slow because I have this...

2332
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:02,890
Okay, how about that?

2333
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:05,510
Okay, let's go in!

2334
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,270
We were just gonna stay like that?

2335
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:10,750
Yeah.

2336
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:13,370
Is that any way to live?

2337
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:14,750
Mine, fan, poem.

2338
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,530
Oh, I thought I was cured.

2339
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:23,070
It's kind of game-breaking, though.

2340
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:25,750
You can't play

2341
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:34,680
it.

2342
01:32:34,780 --> 01:33:05,720
wait it is kind of lagging now yeah oh my god wait she's just i can't move i can't get out oh you can't go down blocked though okay let's restart the lobby okay how do i restart the lobby hold on oh my goodness let me let me uh yeah exit the game yeah oh my god what even happened how Why did you do that?

2343
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,280
I don't know.

2344
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,000
I saw it duplicate, like when I grabbed it earlier.

2345
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,500
That's when I was like, wait a second.

2346
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,880
Oh, you saw duplicate?

2347
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,100
Yeah, and I was like, oh, maybe there's two of them.

2348
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,560
And then I couldn't let go of it.

2349
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,540
Oh, that's why you said there was two of them.

2350
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:29,700
I was like, what's going on?

2351
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:30,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2352
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:35,940
We broke it.

2353
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:36,920
We broke it.

2354
01:33:37,880 --> 01:34:05,440
it's over you think that these people playing as us like we're so like this is hmm we're like the people on the title screen oh yeah like we're that we're just that gamer yeah i think it's us yeah actually they took our footage and yeah yeah we need we want royalties but oh do you send me a thing okay sorry i just saw it yeah yeah yeah no you know you're you're fine okay

Yeah, I missed my block.

2358
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:49,020
I think your PC is haunted by someone other than you.

2359
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:49,640
Makes sense.

2360
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,240
All right.

2361
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:54,760
All right.

2362
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:55,640
Back to five.

2363
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:56,540
All right.

2364
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:57,900
Here we go.

2365
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,000
Very well.

2366
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,380
Oh, my God.

2367
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:01,420
I forgot to capture the game.

2368
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,420
Oh, oopsie.

2369
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:03,920
Okay, okay.

2370
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:04,240
Here we go.

2371
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:04,600
No, we're good.

2372
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:04,880
We're good.

2373
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:06,200
We're good.

2374
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,600
Okay, the game won't break this time, everybody.

2375
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:12,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2376
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,630
All right.

2377
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:17,490
Oh, I should have gone.

2378
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,630
Now Mint is playing.

2379
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:24,350
Mint is now cheating at the battle block feeder.

2380
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:25,410
Nice.

2381
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:25,930
Like I died.

2382
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:26,990
Ow, ow, ow.

Okay.

Hold on.

2387
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:33,190
How do I...

2388
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:33,310
Oh!

2389
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:33,790
Oops.

Okay.

2409
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:59,870

01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:00,470
We're fine.

2411
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:01,110
Everything's good.

2412
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:01,490
It's okay.

2413
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:02,850

2414
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:03,430
Wait.

2415
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:04,850
Maybe you should grab it.

2416
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:05,030
Yeah.

2417
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:05,670

Oh, be careful.

2437
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:30,090
Actually, you might have to...

2438
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:30,730

2439
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:32,190
Oh.

01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:34,630
No, not.

2442
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:35,130
There we go.

2443
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:35,990
Okay.

2444
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:36,950
Very good.

Okay.

2449
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:42,690
And then you go drop it.

2450
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:43,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nice.

2451
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:45,470
And now I die.

2452
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:47,430
Not, yeah.

Oh, oh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

2458
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:00,210
Yeah, surely it won't happen again.

2459
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:01,190
Oh, I can't do it.

2460
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:01,830

Oops.

Nice, nice.

2570
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:13,550
Oh, it's one of these.

2571
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:17,230
Okay, uh...

01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:19,490
Okay.

2574
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:22,250
You should be good.

2575
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:22,770
Oh!

2576
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:24,690
That was such an unlucky spawn.

2577
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:25,170
Oh, cool.

2578
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:25,650
We're fine.

2579
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:27,670
Yeah, that was unlucky.

2580
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:28,750
Okay.

2581
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:30,870
Wait, sorry, I stopped.

2582
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:31,690

2583
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:34,250
Okay, there we go.

2584
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:36,350
Oops.

2585
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,830
Oh, I tried to self-destruct.

2586
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:39,350
I pressed the wrong button.

2587
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,790
Okay, we're fine.

2588
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:43,070
Okay.

2589
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:47,990

Oh, you're gaming.

2592
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:51,750
It's not that hard.

2593
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:53,450
It's actually really easy.

2594
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:56,630
All right, have some confidence.

2595
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:57,890
Is there anything here?

2596
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:58,490
Okay, no.

2597
01:40:58,670 --> 01:40:59,450
Why is that there?

2598
01:40:59,450 --> 01:40:59,830
Or maybe there is.

2599
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:00,190

I don't want anything that stuns, though.

2709
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,620

2751
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:14,800
Okay.

2752
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,260
There was also a teleporter down...

2753
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,760
But I...

2754
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,760
Maybe we missed it.

2755
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,620
Because I feel like it was a while ago.

2756
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,100
Maybe?

2757
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:25,080
Oh, there was?

2758
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:25,980
I didn't see it.

2759
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,100

2760
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:27,640
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2761
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:33,620
Ah!

2762
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:34,860
Get out of here!

2763
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:35,260
Stop!

2764
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,180
Kill him!

2765
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,240
Uh, my...

2766
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:40,840

01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:47,400
Um, oh, oh, uh, how do we get- Oh, they're gone, they're gone.

2768
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,360
There we go, there we go.

2769
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:51,260
Says we go, uh, uh...

2770
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:51,520
Ow!

2771
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:52,680
Oh no!

2772
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,780
Oh, what- There was a guy.

2773
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:56,440
Okay.

2774
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:58,160
Oops, oopsie, I got stunned.

2775
01:47:58,340 --> 01:47:59,860
Oh, hey, I'm gonna kill you.

2776
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,580
I'm gonna kill you.

2777
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,240
I'm gonna kill you.

2778
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:02,340
Kill him, kill him!

2779
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:02,940
Yeah, kill him!

2780
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:04,320

2781
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,700
I killed his air!

2782
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:08,260
Okay.

2783
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:10,220
Nice, nice.

2784
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:11,440
Oh, you're on fire?

2785
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:11,980
That's okay.

2786
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:12,580
Oh, wait.

2787
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:13,720
No, I have to get back up there.

2788
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:14,120
Shoot.

2789
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:15,080
It's okay.

2790
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,060
But we don't have that guy anymore, so.

2791
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:18,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2792
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,480
You don't have to worry about him.

2793
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:20,460
Okay.

2794
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:21,120

01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:22,780
Okay.

2797
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:27,340
Oh, I got rid of this thing, yeah.

01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:33,480
There you go.

2803
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,020
Oh, yeah.

2804
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:38,300

01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:36,780
Okay.

2822
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:41,570
Wait, hold on.

2823
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,500
Yeah, that's easier.

2824
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,220
Did it kill you?

2825
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:45,840
The rock did, maybe.

2826
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,460
But maybe I wasn't supposed to drop it.

2827
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,220
Oh my god!

2828
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:51,360

01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,060
Everything's fine.

2835
01:49:58,180 --> 01:49:58,740
Everything's fine.

2836
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:00,700
Everything is okay.

2837
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,000
How do you get through this?

2838
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,620
Nothing's okay.

2839
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,160
Oh, how did you do that?

2840
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,200
How did you do that?

2841
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:08,860
What the hell?

2842
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,260
What the hell?

2843
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:13,620
I think I keep breaking the game.

2844
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,260
How do we get that though?

2845
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:20,300
Oh, now we go this way.

2846
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,640
But how do we...

2847
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,200
There should be a way to get that, right?

2848
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:26,720
Oh, there's like a secret thing there maybe.

2849
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:27,280
Where?

2850
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:28,020
Somewhere.

2851
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,060
There's something that there's a launcher above here.

2852
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:32,740
Yeah, I know, but how do we get in there?

2853
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:34,620
I don't know.

2854
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:36,800
Uh...

2855
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:38,960

2858
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,260
How would you...

2859
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,260
How would you...

2860
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:50,720
How?

2861
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:52,160

2862
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:52,440
How do you...

2863
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:52,520
How?

2864
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:52,940

2865
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:53,940

2866
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:54,560

2867
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:55,980
How?

2868
01:50:56,380 --> 01:51:04,260
If you had a... If you had a dream that was so real and you could have a... Do anything, what would you do?

2869
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:05,160
What would you do?

2870
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,680
Oops, I tried the same.

2871
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:12,760
hack as before.

2872
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:13,980
The same hack sores.

2873
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:14,760
Get on my body.

2874
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:15,480
Get on my body.

2875
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:18,420
Lay on my body.

2876
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:19,020
Lay on my body.

2877
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:20,920
I'm laying.

2878
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:21,540
I'm laying.

2879
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:22,980
Why did it put me up here?

2880
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:24,480
Okay.

2881
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:24,840
Oops.

2882
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:26,300
Okay.

2883
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:26,920
Nice.

2884
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:27,300
Oh.

2885
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:27,480

01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:28,620
Oh, I get it.

2887
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:28,960
I get it.

2888
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:29,700
It's like you die.

2889
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:30,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2890
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:32,620
Die.

2891
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:33,300
Okay, nice.

2892
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,600
I don't think that's how we're supposed to do it, but... But we do it.

2893
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,460

01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:04,620
Sacrifice herself.

2935
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:09,520
How would she say this?

2936
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:10,600
What the heck?

2937
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:11,860
It's out of blood.

2938
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:43,320

2939
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:44,740
Then we're glitching.

2940
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,180
Yeah, I don't know.

2941
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,700
Like we got through so many levels.

2942
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,560
No, I think we can keep going.

2943
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:50,160
I did get a new computer during that time.

2944
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:54,900
So maybe like my internet like is messed up now?

2945
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:55,500
I don't know.

2946
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:56,560
I have no idea.

2947
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:00,280
Oh my god, my computer.

2948
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:01,360
One second.

2949
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,520
Oh, it's time.

2950
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:04,380
Okay, okay, okay.

2951
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:17,490
Yeah, my Wi-Fi antenna is plugged in.

2952
01:54:18,690 --> 01:54:19,550
I use Wi-Fi.

2953
01:54:19,870 --> 01:54:28,550
I didn't want to say it because I know- I don't, I didn't want to say it because I know people were gonna say something, but I, yeah, I'm- I use Wi-Fi.

2954
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:31,210
Okay, I think I should host the game.

2955
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:37,390
Ooh, oh.

2956
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:40,730
I didn't want to say- I don't know what you're gonna be like.

2957
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:42,770
Oh.

2958
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,490
Wait, there's a- there's a secret up there.

2959
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:46,910
Do you want to- do you want to reset now?

2960
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:48,950
Oh, I see.

2961
01:54:49,150 --> 01:54:49,650
You got it.

2962
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:51,190
No, let's do it after this level.

2963
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:51,890
Now go through.

2964
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:52,910
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2965
01:54:55,570 --> 01:54:55,710
Okay.

2966
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:56,470
God damn it.

2967
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:57,810
Why did you have to...

2968
01:54:57,810 --> 01:55:00,490
Why did you have to out me like that, man?

2969
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:02,830
What's wrong with you?

2970
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:03,170
Oh, no.

2971
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:04,250
I don't think I can get through.

2972
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:06,610
Oh, there you go.

2973
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:07,870
Oh, thank you.

2974
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:08,330
I did it.

2975
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:09,010
I shut it off.

2976
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:11,470
Okay.

2977
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,570
What's wrong?

2978
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:17,090
Nothing's wrong with having Wi-Fi.

2979
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:17,830
Okay?

2980
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:19,850
Wi-Fi is what our...

2981
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:23,870
Your computers were originally built on before you were a computer nerd, okay?

2982
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:25,990
Anyone

2983
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:46,780
good?

2984
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:48,340
Okay, I'm turning...

2985
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:57,950
Oh, it puts me back right...

2986
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2987
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:02,860
Ah!

2988
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:06,090
Oh, I see too.

2989
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:08,030
Oops.

2990
01:56:09,150 --> 01:56:10,730
You got it?

2991
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:11,270
You got it?

2992
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:12,510
Okay, I'll go next.

2993
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:14,630
Okay, you got it?

2994
01:56:15,730 --> 01:56:16,350
You got it?

2995
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:19,030
This still launched me.

2996
01:56:19,310 --> 01:56:19,890
Oh, we're fine.

2997
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,490
It's okay.

2998
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:21,430
We're fine.

2999
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:22,790
I don't have to do anything properly.

3000
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:27,990
Oh, oh, ah, okay, okay.

3001
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:32,110
Okay, it's because I have the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi buff.

3002
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:33,390
Yeah, clearly.

3003
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:34,450
I'm hosting on Wi-Fi.

3004
01:56:36,110 --> 01:56:36,850
Oh, dang it!

3005
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:37,770
I almost had it.

3006
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,710
I got it.

3007
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:39,650
I got it, you got it.

3008
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:41,110
We got it!

3009
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:41,990
Yeah, we got it!

3010
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:42,690
All right.

3011
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:44,170
I'm trapped.

3012
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:45,230
Yeah.

3013
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:51,680
A host buff.

3014
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,740
Yeah, the host buff.

3015
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:53,860
The host buff.

3016
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:55,340
And the wrong Wi-Fi.

3017
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,380
We'll reset the lobby.

3018
01:56:57,820 --> 01:57:00,060
Again for the third time.

3019
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:02,160
It's okay.

3020
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:05,460
It's so that Mint can have zero ping.

3021
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,200
I don't even know what cat I have.

3022
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:10,500
Oh yeah, that's right.

3023
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:11,760
Do you want to...

3024
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,200
Okay, okay.

3025
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:13,620
Okay.

3026
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:14,520
Alright.

3027
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:16,200
I think I have to hide the game, right?

3028
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,320
You don't have to.

3029
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:20,340
I don't think it shows anything, but just in case, maybe.

3030
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:20,720
Okay.

3031
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:22,560
Online play.

3032
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:23,900
Fine.

3033
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:24,640
Uh...

3034
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:26,900
Oh, host player.

3035
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:28,040
Yeah.

3036
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:32,180
And then friends only or private.

3037
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:33,380
Public lobby.

3038
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:37,480
I think you should pick cool things and not dumb and stupid things.

3039
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,760
And now how do I invite you?

3040
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:41,400
Oh, here we go.

3041
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,120
Invite friends.

3042
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:42,820
Wait, did you do public lobby?

3043
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:43,400
Yes.

3044
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:46,380
So you don't do public lobby.

3045
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:48,240
You better hurry up.

3046
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,120
Wait, wait, wait.

3047
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:49,320
Don't.

3048
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,840
What did you do?

3049
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,400
Wait, why do I join?

3050
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:54,520
Okay.

3051
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:55,540
I sent you the invite.

3052
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:57,380
Okay, okay, thank you, thank you.

3053
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:59,040
Jesus Christ!

3054
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:01,520
I didn't do public lobby.

3055
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:02,560
Oh, okay.

3056
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:08,220
Why do you feel so good about lying to me?

3057
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:08,840
Yes!

3058
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:12,720
So messed up.

3059
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:14,760
She's so messed up, man.

3060
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:16,200
It's because I love you.

3061
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,780
Let me know if it's laggy on your end of it.

3062
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:21,760
I don't feel it.

3063
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:22,800

01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:23,600

Oh, wait.

Can't get it.

I'm stuck.

3094

I need you, Mint.

3095
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:14,900
I'm stuck.

3096
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,020
I'm stuck.

3097
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:17,220
I'm stuck.

3098
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:18,160
I'm stuck.

3099
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:18,900
I'm stuck.

3100
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:19,160
I'm stuck.

3101
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:20,260
I'm stuck.

3102
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:21,380
I'm stuck.

3103
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,460
I'm alive yourself.

02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,400
Wait, hold on.

Dang it.

3109
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:28,820
That would work.

3110
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,320
There you go.

3111
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,320
And then I need you to...

3112
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:39,900
Nice!

3113
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:40,780
Woo!

3114
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,560
Oh, that's how you get through.

3115
02:00:44,060 --> 02:00:45,900
Oh, wait, is there anything down here?

3116
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:46,220
No.

3117
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:46,820
No.

3118
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:49,360
No.

3119
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:51,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3120
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,660
I believe in you.

3121
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,320
Me too.

3122
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:56,740
Oh, I did it.

3123
02:00:58,280 --> 02:00:59,160
Okay, nice.

3124
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:00,240
Oh, wait.

3125
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:00,640
What the?

3126
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:01,400
Oh, ah!

3127
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,620
Can we slide under that?

3128
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:04,780
How do we get under that?

3129
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:06,860
I feel like it's too...

3130
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:07,620
Oh, okay.

3131
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:08,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3132
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,640
I can do it this time.

3133
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:12,080
Ah!

3134
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:15,600
Oh, oh.

3135
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:17,580
Nice.

3136
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:18,420
Oh.

3137
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:22,620
Wait.

3138
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:25,620
Get down!

3139
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:27,980
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

3140
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:30,160
Up?

3141
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:31,460
I think you need me.

3142
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,600
I think so, too.

3143
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:34,740
I need you, I need you!

3144
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,840
I need you!

3145
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:37,220
Okay.

3146
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,320
Wait, how though?

3147
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,520
Okay, okay.

3148
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:40,980
Oh, oh, okay, okay.

3149
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:42,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3150
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:43,580
There we go!

3151
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:46,020
We're coming.

3152
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:46,820
Yeah, yeah.

3153
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:47,540
Is this anything?

3154
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:50,000
Oh, yes.

3155
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:51,460
Ah.

3156
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:53,740
Um, he's shooting.

3157
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:54,760
Nice.

3158
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:56,980
Nice.

3159
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:59,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3160
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:01,060
Wait, I got it.

3161
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:01,820
Get me!

3162
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:02,580
Oh!

3163
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:04,140
You hit me!

3164
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:05,000
You hit me!

3165
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:06,440
There we go.

3166
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,360
Okay.

3167
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,860
Oh, wait.

3168
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:11,860
Wait.

3169
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:12,700
Okay.

3170
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:12,960
Thank you.

3171
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:13,800
Yeah.

3172
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:14,260
All right.

3173
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:15,620
Okay.

3174
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:17,760
Ow.

3175
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:22,920
Nice.

3176
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:24,700
Nice, nice.

3177
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,520
Kill that bozo.

3178
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:27,760
Kill that bozo.

3179
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:29,860
Kill that bozo.

3180
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:34,460
Um, I was gonna say, yeah, that's why I went back up.

3181
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:34,900
That's why I went back up.

3182
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:36,340
Oh, is it everything?

3183
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,160
Yep, that's everything.

3184
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:37,960
It is, yeah.

3185
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:39,620
Okay.

3186
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:40,780
Yippee!

3187
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,360
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

3188
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:43,120
Yo, yo!

3189
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,000
Oh, wait.

3190
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:47,380
You're not on the...

3191
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:48,300
Oh, my bad.

3192
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,360
I thought I heard...

3193
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:50,680
I thought we both got...

3194
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,300
Sorry.

3195
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:52,840
I thought that this was...

3196
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:53,980
I thought you were waiting for me.

3197
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:54,420
Oh my god.

3198
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,880
Oh my god, man.

What if I, like, destroyed...

3200
02:02:57,780 --> 02:02:59,160
What if we had time there?

3201
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:00,740
And I destroyed our time.

3202
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,640
I would never forgive you.

3203
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:06,360

02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:09,020
I don't know what this does.

3208
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:10,780
Oh, I think I'm gonna kill you.

3209
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,160
It's supposed to hold...

3210
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,680
Yeah, it's supposed to hold me.

3211
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,600
Here, I'll just...

3212
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:16,060

3213
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,360
Okay.

3214
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:17,840
Okay.

3215
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:20,640
And then...

3216
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:21,640
And then...

3217
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:22,440
Supposed to do this.

3218
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:23,460
Wait.

3219
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:24,000
There we go.

3220
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:26,620
Yeah, so that you can go over there.

3221
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,040
I just want to make sure that there's no...

3222
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,240
Oh, no, you got it.

3223
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:29,440
Okay.

3224
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:30,060
Yeah, I got it.

3225
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:30,720
Wait, what?

3226
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:31,940
Wait, what?

3227
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:32,380
I don't know.

3228
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:33,520
I don't actually get it though.

3229
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:37,740
I don't actually understand, I think.

3230
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:40,480
I think I'm actually quite confused.

3231
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:42,860
Uh...

3232
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:44,140
Where we, uh...

3233
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:45,420
Oh, I see right here, right here.

3234
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:47,480
Oh, okay.

3235
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,140
Wait, no, but that's not us.

3236
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:51,340
Oh, wait, no, we just started the saw.

3237
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,440
We started the saw.

3238
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,080
I see.

3239
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,860
Follow me, follow the leader, follow the leader.

3240
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:58,380
Oh, oh, get it!

3241
02:04:58,620 --> 02:04:59,340
Ah, you got it!

3242
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:00,000
I got it!

3243
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:00,340
Woo!

3244
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:04,400
Oh, don't be like me.

3245
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,480
Oh, how'd you do that?

3246
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:08,500
We're both hacking.

3247
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:09,440
What's going on?

3248
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:10,780
We're both hacking.

3249
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:11,980
Okay, I got it.

3250
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,120
Okay, I'm coming to you.

3251
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:17,760
Oh, I die.

3252
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:18,460
I've got to die.

3253
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:19,000
Oh, wait.

3254
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:20,080
There's a secret in there.

3255
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,660
Don't die.

3256
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:22,200
Don't die.

3257
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:22,620
Oh, okay.

3258
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:23,200
Yeah, yeah.

3259
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:24,440
Wait, where am I?

3260
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:24,820
Oh, I'm here.

3261
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:26,440
Okay, how did I land?

3262
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:27,580
Oh, I'm just safe.

3263
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:31,840
Oh, dang it.

3264
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:34,020
Wait, what the?

3265
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,040
How did I get down here?

3266
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:35,980
I don't know.

3267
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:38,460
Oh, yeah, I got down here.

3268
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:39,400
Oh, oh, oh.

3269
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:40,100
Oh, dang it.

3270
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:40,860
Oh, you got it.

3271
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:41,780
Oh, oh, oh, no.

3272
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:42,700
I made it, though.

3273
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:43,220
Wait, oh.

3274
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,240
Wait, wait.

3275
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:45,500
Okay.

3276
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:46,420
What's going on?

3277
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:47,100
What's going on?

3278
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:47,920
What's going on?

3279
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:48,940
Wait,

3280
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,120
why is it sending me over that way?

3281
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:58,240
Okay.

3282
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,920
Okay, you got it.

3283
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:04,800
You got it?

3284
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,260
You got it?

3285
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:06,300
Oh, I don't have it.

3286
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,180
Wait, oh, this is so much easier.

3287
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:11,260
Wait, what's over here?

3288
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:11,800
Oh, nothing.

3289
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:15,640
Ah!

3290
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:17,580
Dude, die.

3291
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:25,040
Oh, oh, okay.

3292
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:26,940
Okay.

3293
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,420
How are you supposed to make this?

3294
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:28,680
No.

3295
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:29,940
Wait, am I dumb?

3296
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:34,040
You're supposed to, like, time it.

3297
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,160
Chat, I think I'm stupid.

3298
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:37,160
It's tricky.

3299
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:38,340
No, you're not.

3300
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,760
No, don't say that, but my friend, Minto!

3301
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:43,720
Oh, oh my gosh, I can't...

3302
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:44,380
I got stuck.

3303
02:06:44,980 --> 02:06:45,180
Okay.

3304
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:46,040
A big head.

3305
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:47,840
It's okay.

3306
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:49,340
Your big head is lovable.

3307
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:50,440
Oh, there you go, you made it.

3308
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:50,860
I made it!

3309
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:51,820
Oh, okay, you're good.

3310
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:52,800
I don't know.

3311
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:55,700
Oh, this part is kind of...

3312
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:57,340
Ah, I mistimmed it.

3313
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:00,040
Ah, oh, okay, okay.

3314
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:01,720
Okay.

3315
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:03,220
Okay.

3316
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:04,420
I made it.

3317
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:05,240
Oh, you made it!

3318
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:05,960
What the heck?

3319
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:07,180
How'd you do that?

3320
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:09,060
Ah!

3321
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:11,900
Hi.

3322
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:14,980
I made it again.

3323
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:16,780
And I'll do it again.

3324
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:17,200
Whatever.

3325
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:17,840
Oh my god.

3326
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:18,860
Don't...

3327
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:20,760
Not in the phantom.

3328
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:22,340
Where did it put me?

3329
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:22,860
Where'd it go?

3330
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:24,100
No.

3331
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:24,640
No.

3332
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:25,140
No.

3333
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:25,680
Don't do this.

3334
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:26,900
I didn't put you over there.

3335
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:27,680
I don't know.

3336
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:28,700
Wait, why did it put me?

3337
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:32,660
Stop.

3338
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,200
Man, I need you to move.

3339
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:35,480
Man, I need you to move.

3340
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,220
Okay, okay.

3341
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:40,460
What are these spawns?

3342
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,060
Oh, nice.

3343
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:42,720
Oh, okay.

3344
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:43,600
Nice.

3345
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:49,870
Wow.

3346
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:51,110
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

3347
02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:52,930
We did it.

3348
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:53,450
We did it.

3349
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:53,990
We did it.

3350
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:56,470
What is this?

3351
02:07:56,850 --> 02:07:58,650
We have one more to the boss.

3352
02:07:59,950 --> 02:08:00,210
Yeah.

3353
02:08:00,910 --> 02:08:05,630
The iconic duo, Mint Phantom, and Rabie Survivor.

3354
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:08,110
Okay.

3355
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:13,660
Okay, okay.

3356
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:14,880
I don't think that's working.

3357
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:15,860
I don't think that's working.

3358
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:17,160
I don't think that's working.

3359
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,600
It will one day.

3360
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:19,760
Oh!

3361
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:20,080
Oh!

3362
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:23,840
It's gonna work!

3363
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:24,800
It's gonna work now!

3364
02:08:27,740 --> 02:08:28,520
Okay, there we go.

3365
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,040
There we go.

3366
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:30,340
We got it.

3367
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:30,980
We got it.

3368
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:31,660
Oh!

3369
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:34,320
You were definitely in my way.

3370
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,060
I see, I see.

3371
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,920
Ah, no!

3372
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:40,880
I was so close!

3373
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3374
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:44,220
Oh, oh, oh.

3375
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,320
Ah!

3376
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:47,620
Never punished, baby.

3377
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:49,140
Never punish baby.

3378
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:51,740
Never punish...

3379
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:54,200
Never punish baby.

3380
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:55,280
Never punish baby.

3381
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:57,700
Oh my god, oh my god.

3382
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,020
Wait, how do you get through this?

3383
02:08:59,600 --> 02:08:59,920
Ah!

3384
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,380
Wait, what is the...

3385
02:09:03,380 --> 02:09:05,200
Wait, get off the platform.

3386
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,240
Oh, my bad.

3387
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,260
What's the point of this area?

3388
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:10,780
Oh, there's a teleporter!

3389
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:12,020
Oh, I see it now.

3390
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:13,220
I didn't notice it before.

3391
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:15,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3392
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:16,880
Oh God.

3393
02:09:17,640 --> 02:09:17,900
Ah!

3394
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:18,780
Where'd I go?

3395
02:09:18,980 --> 02:09:19,340
Oh, hello.

3396
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:20,680
Okay.

3397
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:21,820
No ice?

3398
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:22,460
Okay.

3399
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,420
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

3400
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:28,740
Yeah, our our chibi models, oh.

3401
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:32,480
Our chibi models are by hexos.

3402
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:34,420
Yeah, oh.

3403
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,360
Oh my goodness.

3404
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:36,020
Oh my god.

3405
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,180
It's just a massacre.

3406
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:37,940
It's just a massacre.

3407
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:38,640
What the heck?

3408
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,460
How do you do this?

3409
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:41,680
Oh.

3410
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:42,800
Wait, what?

3411
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:43,620
Oh, what?

3412
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:47,560
Okay.

3413
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:48,500
Oh, nice!

3414
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:48,980
Nice!

3415
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:49,460
Nice!

3416
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:50,560
Oh, you're so good.

3417
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:51,440
You're dead.

3418
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:52,320
But you're so good.

3419
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:52,880
I did it.

3420
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:53,340
I did it.

3421
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:53,800
It's fine.

3422
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:54,520
You did it.

3423
02:09:54,540 --> 02:09:54,760
I did it.

3424
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:55,100
I did it twice.

3425
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:58,240
Oh, shoot.

3426
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:00,380
Okay.

3427
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:01,860
Okay.

3428
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:03,420
Hey!

3429
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:04,740
Oh!

3430
02:10:10,510 --> 02:10:11,330
Oh, go, go!

3431
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:11,970
Oh!

3432
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:12,690
Oh!

3433
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:17,650
Wait, how are you supposed to do this for me?

3434
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:22,770
I think maybe we're supposed to go on the blue thing and you throw me over maybe.

3435
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:25,170
But I made it really well.

3436
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:26,750
Oh, okay, there we go.

3437
02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:28,610
Oh, okay, nice, nice, nice.

3438
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:29,790
Okay, get back, get back here.

3439
02:10:30,530 --> 02:10:31,430
I will try.

3440
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:33,650
Okay, okay, now.

3441
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,310
Okay, nice.

3442
02:10:37,450 --> 02:10:37,930
Woohoo!

3443
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:40,430
Okay, what's going on here?

3444
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:41,250
Woohoo!

3445
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:45,110
Yeah, that seems like a secret.

3446
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:46,550
It does, right?

3447
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:48,150
Yeah, what the heck?

3448
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:49,650
We're like so paranoid now.

3449
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:51,450
I know, everything is secret.

3450
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:53,930
Okay, maybe Maybe not.

3451
02:10:57,130 --> 02:10:58,030
You got it?

3452
02:10:58,170 --> 02:10:58,590
Good job.

3453
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:58,870
Okay.

3454
02:10:59,870 --> 02:11:00,270
Okay.

3455
02:11:01,170 --> 02:11:01,570
All right.

3456
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:02,570
Oh, okay.

3457
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:05,070
All right.

3458
02:11:05,730 --> 02:11:06,290
What is this?

3459
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:07,630
Did this do anything?

3460
02:11:09,310 --> 02:11:11,170
I think it lifts it up.

3461
02:11:12,610 --> 02:11:13,290
Oh, you think so?

3462
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:14,170
Beam me up!

3463
02:11:14,370 --> 02:11:14,710
Barry!

3464
02:11:15,310 --> 02:11:15,850
Oh, just kidding.

3465
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:16,530
I think it's automatic.

3466
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:17,170
I think it's automatic.

3467
02:11:17,490 --> 02:11:18,030
Wait, maybe not?

3468
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:19,850
Oh, okay, okay.

3469
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:20,650
Go.

3470
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:21,230
Oh, oh.

3471
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:21,990
Maybe that's...

3472
02:11:21,990 --> 02:11:22,590
Oh, it goes too.

3473
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:25,230
Okay, it's a little...

3474
02:11:25,230 --> 02:11:25,450
Oh.

3475
02:11:26,290 --> 02:11:26,770
Okay.

3476
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:28,370
Um...

3477
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:28,750
Okay, okay.

3478
02:11:28,870 --> 02:11:29,690
There's flaws.

3479
02:11:30,070 --> 02:11:30,690
There's flaws.

3480
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:31,650
Okay, okay, okay.

3481
02:11:31,890 --> 02:11:32,650
Just dodge.

3482
02:11:32,890 --> 02:11:33,270
Just dodge.

3483
02:11:33,370 --> 02:11:35,530
Oh, I see.

3484
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:36,370
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3485
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:37,070

02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:41,960
Nice.

3546
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:42,220
Nice.

02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:46,640
Oh.

3549
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:47,640
Why is that everything?

3550
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,820
Yeah, I think so.

3551
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:49,920
Why did you get up there?

3552
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:50,920
Why invite...

3553
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:51,320
I'm all for trouble.

3554
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:52,680
Hello?

3555
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:53,000
Hello?

3556
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,180
I'm pushing it higher.

3557
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:59,400
Yeah, I think if it...

3558
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:02,060
I think if you keep staying on it, it doesn't go as hot.

3559
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:04,240
You have to like continuously jump on it.

3560
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:05,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3561
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:06,460
Or maybe not.

3562
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,060
Maybe not.

3563
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:07,720
I don't understand.

3564
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:09,360
I don't understand.

3565
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:09,700
Or maybe not.

3566
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:10,020
I don't know.

3567
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:11,320
Okay, I'm gonna set it up.

3568
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:15,560
You got it!

3569
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:16,480
Oh, there you go.

3570
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:19,740
Huh?

3571
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:22,180
Huh?

3572
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:23,040
Huh?

3573
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:31,050
Huh?

3574
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:32,690
All right, boss time.

3575
02:14:34,910 --> 02:14:35,130
Huh?

3576
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:39,360
Huh?

3577
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:42,620
I punched you the baby.

3578
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:44,060
I punched you the baby.

3579
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:47,620
I said the baby, I'm fine.

3580
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:52,300
All right.

3581
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:52,520
Oh.

3582
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:54,240
I was scratching my nose.

3583
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:56,000
Oh my god.

3584
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:57,120
I wish I was there.

3585
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:01,260
Oh, I wish I could just ride on your head.

3586
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:02,900
Yeah, imagine.

3587
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:04,140
Oh, okay, okay.

3588
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:04,640
We got lock-in.

3589
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:04,920
We got lock-in.

3590
02:15:04,940 --> 02:15:06,220
All right, lock-in, lock-in, lock-in.

3591
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:07,160
Lock-in, lock-in.

3592
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:08,460
Okay.

3593
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:09,860
Oh.

3594
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,400
Cut that out.

3595
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:13,920
Cut that out.

3596
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,460
We're still locked in.

3597
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:17,360
We're still locked in.

3598
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:18,080
We're still locked in.

3599
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,500
We're still locked in no matter what.

3600
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:20,200
Okay, I got it.

3601
02:15:23,420 --> 02:15:24,060
I don't know what.

3602
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:24,360
We're good.

3603
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:25,420
Oh, no.

3604
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:26,320
Oh, keep continuing.

3605
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:27,220
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3606
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,040
Why did you spawn there?

3607
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:28,720
I don't know.

3608
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:30,080
Oh, the game hates me.

3609
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:40,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, I was on your head.

3610
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:42,420
Okay, okay, we're fine, we're fine.

3611
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:43,360
Everything's good.

3612
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:45,240
Okay, nice.

3613
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:46,500
Anything here?

3614
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:47,060
Nothing here?

3615
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:47,360
Okay.

3616
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,480
Yeah, I'm going to go now.

3617
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:52,560
What is that?

3618
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:53,680
Jump on my head.

3619
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:55,420
Okay, I'm jumping.

3620
02:15:56,300 --> 02:15:56,560
Okay.

3621
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:58,400
I take the boulder off.

3622
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:00,640
Okay, okay.

3623
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:04,600
And then, I don't think you go that way anymore.

3624
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:05,780
Oh.

3625
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:07,380
Oh!

3626
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:08,780
Okay, okay.

3627
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:09,160
I see!

3628
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:11,320
Okay.

3629
02:16:12,660 --> 02:16:14,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3630
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:15,120
Okay.

3631
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:17,680
Oh, wait, how do I get out of this?

3632
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:20,440
How do I...

3633
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:21,280
What are you doing?

3634
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:23,220
I don't know how to get out of this.

3635
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:24,680
You might have to just die.

3636
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:25,400
You might just have to die.

3637
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:26,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3638
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:30,160
Okay, okay, nice.

3639
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:33,180
What do you want?

3640
02:16:33,300 --> 02:16:34,960
You got the checkpoint over there, though.

3641
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:36,380
Yeah, that's so messed up.

3642
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:36,820
Just keep going.

3643
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:37,380
Just keep going.

3644
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:38,580
Okay, I'm going.

3645
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:39,200
Okay, okay.

3646
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:40,580
The wind, the wind.

3647
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:42,780
Oh, I see.

3648
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:43,360
You have to climb.

3649
02:16:43,460 --> 02:16:44,720
Okay, okay, nice, nice.

3650
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:45,740
Okay, nice.

3651
02:16:46,100 --> 02:16:46,300
Okay.

3652
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:48,080
The rocks are gonna fall.

3653
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:48,840
Oh!

3654
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:52,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, God.

3655
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:54,060
Oh, God, oh, that's a lot of rocks.

3656
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:55,260
There's a lot of rocks.

3657
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:56,780
There's a lot of rocks.

3658
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:58,320
Nothing up here?

3659
02:16:58,820 --> 02:16:59,460
Uh-oh.

3660
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:00,680
Uh...

3661
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:01,820
Wait, um...

3662
02:17:01,820 --> 02:17:05,100
Oh, did we... did we mess up now?

3663
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:05,740
Wait, did I mess up?

3664
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,880
Oh, I guess we...

3665
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:07,960
No, no, no, no, we met...

3666
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:09,120
We, we...

3667
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:09,940
It was a group effort.

3668
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:10,920
It's okay, we're just still.

3669
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:11,480
Wait.

3670
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,780
We don't need everything.

3671
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,800
Yeah, we don't need everything!

3672
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:15,360
What the...

3673
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:15,700
Help!

3674
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:18,240
Wait.

3675
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:19,000
Okay.

3676
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:20,720
Oh, I can't see...

3677
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:22,080
Oh, why did it spawn me there?

3678
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:24,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3679
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:25,960
Let's fly straight!

3680
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:27,220
Oh, I'm at the top!

3681
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:28,060
How did I get here?

3682
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:33,040
Help!

3683
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:35,300
Help!

3684
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,220
Why is it so hard to fly?

3685
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:40,180
Help!

3686
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:41,540
Oh, oh, I got it, I got it.

3687
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:42,020
You're at the top!

3688
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:43,660
We got it!

3689
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:45,500
Yippee!

3690
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:47,660
Wait, there's like a capa.

3691
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:49,100
Oh, he's cute.

3692
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:50,440
What the heck?

3693
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:52,340
I think you're stuck.

3694
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:52,800
I'm stuck.

3695
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:53,780
Oh, okay, there we go.

3696
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:54,740
Okay.

3697
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:58,100
I think that was everything.

3698
02:17:58,280 --> 02:18:00,240
There was an emerald there.

3699
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:01,180
Oh, he like walked.

3700
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:02,240

I get it.

3703
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:04,360
Oh.

3704
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:05,740
Oh, whoops.

3705
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:09,520
Now we're thinking with my...

3706
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,540
Oh my god.

3707
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:16,180
Oh my god, my timing is all...

3708
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:17,100
It's okay, it's okay.

3709
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:18,260
We just have to go to the goal now.

3710
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:19,140
We just have to go to the goal.

3711
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:21,120
Yeah, we just have to get to the goal.

3712
02:18:22,060 --> 02:18:23,320
Yeah, we have to get to the goal.

3713
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:23,720
Just get to the goal.

3714
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:24,400
Just get to the goal.

3715
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:24,780
Ah!

3716
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:28,820
Ah, wait!

3717
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:29,580
No!

3718
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:30,500
No!

3719
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:42,380
Ow.

3720
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:44,720
Okay.

3721
02:18:47,170 --> 02:18:47,470
Nice.

3722
02:18:47,610 --> 02:18:48,690
There's an emerald over there.

3723
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:48,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3724
02:18:49,070 --> 02:18:49,070
Yeah.

3725
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:50,930
Oh, uh...

3726
02:18:50,930 --> 02:18:51,390
Oops.

3727
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:53,150
Oh, do I need to throw you?

3728
02:18:54,230 --> 02:18:54,450
What?

3729
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:54,790
Go!

3730
02:18:55,130 --> 02:18:55,970
Oh, don't go.

3731
02:18:57,730 --> 02:19:00,240
Oh, oops.

3732
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:03,240
I also was able to just jump over there, to be honest.

3733
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:04,960
Like that?

3734
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:05,200
Yeah.

3735
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:05,900
Okay.

3736
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:06,560
Oh, my God.

3737
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:06,940
Okay.

3738
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:09,660
Okay, we just... The timing is all off.

3739
02:19:09,860 --> 02:19:10,940
The timing is all off!

3740
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:11,260
Okay, okay.

3741
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:12,300
You got it!

3742
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:12,640
You got it!

3743
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:13,440
Okay, nice, nice.

3744
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:14,100
Okay, just continue.

3745
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:14,500
You just continue.

3746
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:15,680
No, I got the emerald.

3747
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:16,100
I got the emerald.

3748
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:16,460
Oh, you did?

3749
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:17,200
Oh, just kidding.

3750
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:17,600
Okay.

3751
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,400
We're fine.

3752
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:18,940
Oh.

3753
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:21,800
Oh, my God.

3754
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:25,920
Oh, dang

3755
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:36,080
it.

3756
02:19:37,220 --> 02:19:38,040
You got it?

3757
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:39,420
You got it?

3758
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:39,860
Okay, okay.

3759
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:41,080
Okay.

3760
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:42,000
All right.

3761
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:42,360
Remove.

3762
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:42,960
Okay.

3763
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:44,720
All right.

3764
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:45,340
We'll get trapped.

3765
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:48,200
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

3766
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:49,680
Go, go, go, go.

3767
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:54,540
All right.

3768
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:55,120
Okay, we're good.

3769
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,700
The boulders are coming!

3770
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:58,540
Get the diamond!

3771
02:19:58,680 --> 02:19:59,240
Get the diamond!

3772
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:01,470
Get it!

3773
02:20:01,590 --> 02:20:02,070
I got it!

3774
02:20:02,170 --> 02:20:02,350
Okay!

3775
02:20:03,010 --> 02:20:03,370
Go!

3776
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:05,930
Where am I?

3777
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:06,990
Oh, I was...

3778
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:13,680
Oh, yeah, I did.

3779
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:13,920
Okay.

3780
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:16,060
Where am I?

3781
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:16,660
I got this.

3782
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:17,900
Oh, I didn't!

3783
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:18,760
Oh my gosh, you're right.

3784
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:19,680
Oops.

3785
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:20,160
It's okay.

3786
02:20:21,860 --> 02:20:24,380
Uh, I think I have to wait for him to...

3787
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:25,340
Yeah, turn it off.

3788
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:25,800
There you go.

3789
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:26,940
Okay.

3790
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:26,980
Okay.

3791
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:27,620
Goodbye.

3792
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:28,500
Goodbye.

3793
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:29,520
Goodbye.

3794
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:30,300
Okay.

3795
02:20:30,660 --> 02:20:31,060
All right.

3796
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:31,500
Hello.

3797
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:32,000
Hello.

3798
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:32,520
Okay.

3799
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:32,680
All right.

3800
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:33,220
Let's go.

3801
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:34,860
All right, we're at the end here.

3802
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,040
We have plenty of...

3803
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,700
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

3804
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:40,120
We have plenty of time now.

3805
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,220
Oops, oops, oops, oops.

3806
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:43,740
Wait, hold on.

3807
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:44,740
Okay, hold on, okay.

3808
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:48,580
Oops, oops.

3809
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:48,900
Okay.

3810
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:59,200
There's a ball at the end, so don't go on the actual, don't go on the ending thing.

3811
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:00,980
Oh my God, it undone!

3812
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:03,360
Ah, it was right there because I was waiting.

3813
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:04,540
close.

3814
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:08,460
I could see it by the hair on your chinny chin chin.

3815
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:09,120
I got the ball.

3816
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:10,180
Just go in.

3817
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:10,680
Okay, okay.

3818
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:14,080
We just have to go on the we just have to go on the the final thing.

3819
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,900
Yeah, just get in there.

3820
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:19,320
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.

3821
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:21,840
Sorry, not you, not you.

3822
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:26,700
I'm just trying to not curse.

3823
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:27,120
Okay.

3824
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:28,040
Okay.

3825
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:29,920
Oops, oops, and then they're climbing wrong.

3826
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:32,000
Have you gotten over there even once, Barry?

3827
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:34,400
Can we not talk?

3828
02:21:34,660 --> 02:21:36,120
I was there last time.

3829
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:36,640
Okay.

3830
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:37,920
I don't need to prove anything.

3831
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:39,580
Ah!

3832
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:40,320
Wait, wait, wait!

3833
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:41,440
Oh, you already got the ball!

3834
02:21:42,220 --> 02:21:42,440
Okay.

3835
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:45,220
I forgot.

3836
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:46,720
Oh.

3837
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:47,580
Oh.

3838
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:51,900
Ah!

3839
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:52,580
Okay.

3840
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:53,800
Well, we got that.

3841
02:21:54,220 --> 02:21:55,120
What is...

3842
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:56,300
What's exploding?

3843
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:58,940
The job?

3844
02:21:59,740 --> 02:22:00,180
Okay, nice.

3845
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:01,560
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

3846
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,180
You're okay?

3847
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:06,060
Oh, oh, oh!

3848
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:08,720
Oh, okay.

3849
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:09,040
Oh, man.

3850
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,700
This is rough.

3851
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:18,670
I'm trying.

3852
02:22:18,930 --> 02:22:19,390
We got it.

3853
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:21,720
Okay, okay.

3854
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:22,100
Okay.

3855
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:23,100
Is there any secrets?

3856
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:23,560
No secrets?

3857
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:23,920
No secrets?

3858
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:25,480
I don't think there's actually secrets.

3859
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:26,020
Oh, oops.

3860
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:27,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3861
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:31,100
You got to slide.

3862
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:31,700
You got to slide.

3863
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:32,280
You got to slide.

3864
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:33,000
That should count.

3865
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:34,420
That should count.

3866
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:34,800
That should count.

3867
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:36,920
Freak!

3868
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:38,060
Freak!

3869
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:39,220
Oh, oops.

3870
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:40,820
Okay, it's okay.

3871
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:41,040
It's good.

3872
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:41,700
Okay.

3873
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:43,760
Nice!

3874
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:45,280
Oh, I had it!

3875
02:22:46,340 --> 02:22:47,280
I did slide.

3876
02:22:48,460 --> 02:22:48,800
Oh!

3877
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:49,640
Good job!

3878
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:51,020
Okay, you got it, you got it.

3879
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:51,240
Nice.

3880
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:54,300
Okay, I don't know how I got that.

3881
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:54,940
Thank you.

3882
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:56,080
I used your head, I think.

3883
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:56,700
Okay, cool.

3884
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:57,740
Okay, whatever works.

3885
02:22:58,700 --> 02:22:59,140
Whatever works.

3886
02:22:59,240 --> 02:22:59,540
Whatever works.

3887
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:00,340
I made it somehow.

3888
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:00,940
Okay, nice.

3889
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:02,080
Keep going, keep going.

3890
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:02,620
Okay, I'm going.

3891
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:04,160
Okay.

3892
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:05,860
Okay, okay.

3893
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:06,420
Watch out here.

3894
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:06,660
Okay.

3895
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:09,600
I'm going through you.

3896
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:10,600
Okay, nice.

3897
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:12,440
Good job, good job.

3898
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:12,760
No!

3899
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:15,160
Don't follow me!

3900
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:16,100
Ah!

3901
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:20,330
Oh gosh, okay.

3902
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:23,410
Oh, dang it, I didn't notice it.

3903
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:27,950
It's so hard to see with like the little exclamation points everywhere.

3904
02:23:30,110 --> 02:23:30,830
Oh my god.

3905
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:31,790
Okay, I think I got it.

3906
02:23:31,790 --> 02:23:32,030
Dang it!

3907
02:23:32,450 --> 02:23:33,090
Okay, you got it.

3908
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:33,990
Just keep going, just keep going.

3909
02:23:34,970 --> 02:23:35,350
Okay, we're good.

3910
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:36,410
Okay.

3911
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:38,590
And then- Oh, we gotta go down.

3912
02:23:38,590 --> 02:23:39,050
Oh, we gotta slide.

3913
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:39,690
We gotta be down.

3914
02:23:40,390 --> 02:23:41,170
Oh, wait, hold on.

3915
02:23:41,290 --> 02:23:41,910
I stopped.

3916
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:43,770
Oops.

3917
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:45,250
Uh, whatever.

3918
02:23:45,430 --> 02:23:45,970
Just stop.

3919
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:46,570
I don't know.

3920
02:23:46,610 --> 02:23:47,190
I came to a stop.

3921
02:23:47,350 --> 02:23:47,470
Okay.

3922
02:23:49,190 --> 02:23:49,790
I'm going.

3923
02:23:50,530 --> 02:23:51,730
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

3924
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:52,630
I got it.

3925
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:54,050
Oh my god, you're so fucking good.

3926
02:23:55,250 --> 02:23:56,250
Oh, okay, okay.

3927
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:56,630
Wait, hold on.

3928
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:58,010
Don't jinx it.

3929
02:23:58,290 --> 02:23:58,910
Oh, yeah, it's okay.

3930
02:23:59,170 --> 02:24:00,370
Sorry, I should have said it.

3931
02:24:01,070 --> 02:24:01,430
Okay.

3932
02:24:04,510 --> 02:24:05,650
Oh, I'm not good.

3933
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:06,570
Just keep going.

3934
02:24:06,970 --> 02:24:08,650
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3935
02:24:08,650 --> 02:24:09,690
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3936
02:24:12,250 --> 02:24:12,330
Okay, okay.

3937
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:12,670
Okay, keep going.

3938
02:24:14,770 --> 02:24:18,470
Oh my gosh, wait, there's, oh, I didn't notice that, okay.

3939
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:39,700
Emphid!

3940
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:40,820
Emphid!

3941
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:41,760
It vexes me so.

3942
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:42,740
It truly does.

3943
02:24:42,940 --> 02:24:44,240
But where did it come from?

3944
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:48,000
Well, children, some say the hat was blessed by a voodoo witch doctor.

3945
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:51,100
And then cursed by another voodoo witch doctor like 30 minutes later.

3946
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:52,040
I'm gonna eat goldfish.

3947
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:54,460
Without me?

3948
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:55,260
Without me?

3949
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:59,040
When he found the hat perched atop a giant ruby.

3950
02:24:59,380 --> 02:25:02,160
A ruby that naturally formed into the shape of a skull.

3951
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:03,420
A human skull.

3952
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:04,620
Oh.

3953
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:09,740
I think the hat is haunted by all the souls of its previous owners.

3954
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:10,120
By you?

3955
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:12,460
All of their dreams and failures mashed together.

3956
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:13,180
I've never had that hat.

3957
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:14,540
I've never had that hat.

3958
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:14,760
Oh.

3959
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:15,460
Oh.

3960
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:22,240
Well, I guess if you ever have a future outfit where there's a hat, it's gonna be a little suspicious.

3961
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:25,120
Stuff I've ever heard in my entire life, but I'm the dumb one.

3962
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:25,700
That's fine.

3963
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:28,040
And not just anyone can dom the hat you know.

3964
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:32,200
It calls out only to those who embody the exemplary qualities required.

3965
02:25:34,340 --> 02:25:36,840
Ah, so it only corrupts pure souls.

3966
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:38,940
Like us.

3967
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:40,940
Oh, so I definitely can have this hat.

3968
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:42,480
Yeah, yeah.

3969
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:43,840
Me too.

3970
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:44,980
That's preposterous.

3971
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:47,020
And heavyweighs the crown.

3972
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:55,160
He who wears the hat calls the shots and in a time long forgotten maintain balance and ensure that everyone was plump and happy and wanted for nothing.

3973
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:57,440
But all good things come to an end, children.

3974
02:25:57,780 --> 02:25:58,960
Well, that's not entirely true.

3975
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:00,840
I figure pizza will always exist.

3976
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:06,040
But this hat, let's just say it's days of benevolent You don't really...

3977
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:07,540
I feel like...

3978
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:17,480
A lot of games nowadays try to establish this type of like narrative style where it's like very quirky.

3979
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:19,320
But I feel like they don't really...

3980
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:22,600
They don't really get it like this.

3981
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:24,040
Yeah, I get it.

3982
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:24,420
Yeah, right?

3983
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:27,780
Like it always feels like too cringe, but this feels like cringe in a good way.

3984
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:29,840
This is cringe, you know.

3985
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:32,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

3986
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,780
I need you more than ever now.

3987
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:38,800
I guess maybe it's just the fact that it's like more indie feeling.

3988
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:40,160
Yeah, not a lot of games.

3989
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:44,380
It feels authentic where like new games are like quirky to be quirky.

3990
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:45,580
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3991
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,360
It feels very corporate the other game.

3992
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:47,900
Yeah.

3993
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,860
I think we escape after this.

3994
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:52,660
I think so too.

3995
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:53,480
I think we're gonna escape.

3996
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:54,860
Yeah.

3997
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:56,040
That cat's looking at me.

3998
02:26:56,820 --> 02:26:58,040
Wait, what's on the other side?

3999
02:26:58,200 --> 02:26:58,980
What's over here?

4000
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,340
It's a locked back yard.

4001
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,020
Yeah, I think we're escaping after this.

4002
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:05,120
What's a piece?

4003
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:05,500
You see him here?

4004
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:07,440
It's hopeless.

4005
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:09,980
Oh, oh, oh, wait.

4006
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:11,060
They're protesting.

4007
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:12,000
They're protesting.

4008
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:12,820
Oh my god, they're Hattie.

4009
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:14,180
Oh my god.

4010
02:27:14,380 --> 02:27:16,060
Shame on Hattie Hattieton.

4011
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:17,680
What?

4012
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:21,080
Oh my god.

4013
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,300
I know what I did.

4014
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:27,200
Okay.

4015
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:28,140
Oh, whoa.

4016
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:30,580
It's like that one Neopets.

4017
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:33,500
Oh my god, I know exactly what you're talking about.

4018
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:35,780
Oh, okay.

4019
02:27:37,940 --> 02:27:38,700
Oh, be careful!

4020
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:39,740
Just kidding.

4021
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:41,060
Wait, is it that way?

4022
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:41,320
Oops.

4023
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:42,800
Oh, wait, wait.

4024
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,120
There's like something up here, I think.

4025
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, that might be something.

4026
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:47,760
Yeah, try.

4027
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:50,280
Nice.

4028
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:52,820
Nice.

4029
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:55,240
Oh, I think I need you.

4030
02:27:55,340 --> 02:27:55,860
I think I need you.

4031
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:56,560
Okay, I'm coming.

4032
02:27:56,580 --> 02:27:58,380
Wait, but then we can also go this way as a team.

4033
02:27:58,380 --> 02:28:01,140
Yeah, this is like the most...

4034
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:02,140
It's like open-ended.

4035
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:02,640
What the heck?

4036
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:05,320
Oops.

4037
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:09,620
Oh, yeah, which way do we want to go then?

4038
02:28:10,660 --> 02:28:14,440
I guess I could just go this way since we already kind of started it.

4039
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:17,400
Oh, I'm so bad at this.

4040
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:18,340
It's okay.

4041
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:19,720
I hate wall jump.

4042
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:20,840
Please.

4043
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,240
You just have to keep going on the slime.

4044
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:24,000
I know.

4045
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:25,260
If I could reach the slime.

4046
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:26,880
Slime, slime, slime.

4047
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:27,720
You got it, you got it.

4048
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:28,820

Oh, be careful.

4052
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:34,200
We just have to...

4053
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:35,860
Do you want to launch me or should I launch you?

4054
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:36,040

Because we have to move these, I guess, again.

4120
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:37,960
Oh, so it stops.

4121
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:38,920

Okay, okay, okay.

4127
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,940
You do the bolder thing because I think you're better at it.

4128
02:31:53,980 --> 02:31:54,280
Push it close.

4129
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:55,420
There we go.

4130
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:57,280
Okay, I need you to go the other way.

4131
02:31:57,340 --> 02:31:57,980
Oh, okay, okay.

4139
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:09,460

Oops.

4142
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:11,060

02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:18,440
Okay.

4145
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:19,200
Oh, whoa.

4146
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:20,080
What?

4147
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:21,320
Why are you going on?

4148
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:21,760
I don't know.

4149
02:32:22,120 --> 02:32:22,940
Wait, keep going.

4150
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:23,340
Wait.

4151
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:24,240
Keep doing that.

4152
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:25,620
Because then you could have just...

4153
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:25,820
Oh!

4154
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:27,160
Sorry.

4155
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:27,980
I didn't...

4156
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:28,200
It's okay.

4157
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:28,680
It's okay.

4158
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:28,820
It's okay.

4159
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:36,220
Okay.

4160
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:38,400
Just all according to Keikaku.

4161
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:39,880
Okay, okay.

4162
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:40,760
Hold on.

4163
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:41,800
Hold on.

4164
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:42,500
How do I...

4165
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:42,980
Yeah, yeah.

4166
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:43,880
Okay, now jump.

4167
02:32:44,380 --> 02:32:44,980
Oh, what?

02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,820
Yeah, jump with me on it.

4169
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:47,980
Or you should have been holding it.

4170
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:49,140
There we go.

4171
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:50,300
This works too.

4172
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:51,760
Yeah, this kind of works.

4173
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:54,260
Oh!

4174
02:33:00,070 --> 02:33:01,070
It's okay, it's okay.

4175
02:33:01,350 --> 02:33:02,010
One more time.

4176
02:33:02,350 --> 02:33:03,990
One more time!

4177
02:33:04,390 --> 02:33:06,010
Right on your dead body.

4178
02:33:07,150 --> 02:33:07,610
Okay.

4179
02:33:08,330 --> 02:33:08,810

We both worked hard for it.

What is this upset?

4194
02:34:06,710 --> 02:34:07,450

Okay.

4199
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:16,230
I'm being so careful right now.

4200
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:17,530
It's okay though.

4201
02:34:18,470 --> 02:34:23,630
You have the help!

4202
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:33,800
Wait, why did the music stop when you...

4203
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:36,300
Everybody hated that.

4204
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:36,940
What the heck?

4205
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:37,800
I got it.

4206
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:38,780
First try.

4207
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:40,620
Shut up!

4208
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:46,360
Okay, how do we... Where do we go?

4209
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:48,240
Or I guess maybe you throw me?

4210
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:51,360
Oh, hold on.

4211
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:52,020

02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:55,600
That way.

4215
02:34:55,820 --> 02:34:55,980
Okay.

4216
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:57,040
Okay, little baby.

4217
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:57,920
Come on, little baby.

4218
02:34:59,080 --> 02:34:59,740
Okay, I'm going.

4219
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:03,040
I'm getting pissed off.

4220
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:04,320
Hold on.

4221
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:06,340
My dad is collateral damage.

4222

The secret!

4294
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:21,940
It was nothing.

4295
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:23,520
It was nothing at all.

4296
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:25,100

Good job, good job.

4303
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:45,670
There's nothing else over there.

4304
02:38:46,310 --> 02:38:46,950
It's just a loop.

4305
02:38:47,890 --> 02:38:48,510
Okay, okay.

4306
02:38:50,410 --> 02:38:52,350
Oops, I still died.

It's okay.

4308
02:38:55,550 --> 02:38:56,990
I don't know how to...

4309
02:38:56,990 --> 02:38:58,230

Wait, wait, wait.

4317

Okay.

4319
02:39:14,730 --> 02:39:15,350
Oh, ah!

4320
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:16,310
I should have let go.

4321
02:39:16,430 --> 02:39:16,910
I should have let...

4322
02:39:16,910 --> 02:39:17,250
Maybe?

4323
02:39:17,330 --> 02:39:17,810
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

4324
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:18,550
Do it again, do it again.

4325
02:39:19,650 --> 02:39:19,930
What?

4326
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:21,770
Oh, oh, you were so close.

4327
02:39:23,030 --> 02:39:23,270
Okay.

4328
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:24,470
Go!

02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:25,370
Yay!

4330
02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:26,190
Nice!

4331
02:39:26,350 --> 02:39:27,050
Oh, that was perfect.

4332
02:39:27,470 --> 02:39:27,930
Okay, okay.

4333
02:39:28,310 --> 02:39:28,890
What did that do?

4334
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:29,590
I don't know.

4335
02:39:29,970 --> 02:39:32,430
Oh, we got the yarn from it.

4336
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:34,110
Oh, we missed the secret.

4337
02:39:35,150 --> 02:39:36,550
Where is the secret?

4338
02:39:37,170 --> 02:39:38,970
Oh, good job.

4339
02:39:39,290 --> 02:39:40,550
Oh, you got both of them though.

4340
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:41,330
Thank you.

4341
02:39:42,910 --> 02:39:44,370
Maybe no secret.

4342
02:39:44,970 --> 02:39:46,090
No, there has to be.

4343
02:39:46,190 --> 02:39:46,930
Oh, my God.

4344
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:56,220
Oh, oh.

4345
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:58,600
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

4346
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:05,600
Yeah, I don't know.

4347
02:40:06,740 --> 02:40:07,080
Oh,

4348
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:14,600
yeah, yeah, do that.

4349
02:40:17,780 --> 02:40:18,860
Oh, okay, I killed us.

4350
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:21,160
Oh, wait, we missed the secret.

4351
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:22,420
Where is the secret?

4352
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:25,400
I think it was maybe in the beginning?

4353
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:25,920
I think so.

4354
02:40:26,260 --> 02:40:28,580
We can just complete the level and then come back if we want.

4355
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:29,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4356
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:31,400
Mito stuck!

4357
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:34,840
Mito stuck!

4358
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:36,020
Mito stuck!

4359
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:39,480
Alright, so the second level had a secret.

4360
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:40,880
Yeah.

4361
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:43,980
Alright.

4362
02:40:44,980 --> 02:40:45,880
Launch me.

4363
02:40:46,940 --> 02:40:47,580
Sorry.

4364
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:48,380
Okay.

4365
02:40:49,340 --> 02:40:49,960
I'll...

4366
02:40:49,960 --> 02:40:50,120
Wait!

4367
02:40:51,500 --> 02:40:52,140
Okay.

4368
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:54,380
Yeah, goop yourself.

4369
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:55,520
Wait.

4370
02:40:56,300 --> 02:40:56,800
Wait.

4371
02:40:58,240 --> 02:40:58,560
Oh.

4372
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,460
Oh my god.

4373
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:00,120
Okay, you'll die.

4374
02:41:00,740 --> 02:41:01,620
There's a death trap.

4375
02:41:02,020 --> 02:41:02,660
Oh, oh my god.

4376
02:41:02,860 --> 02:41:03,720
Oh my, oh my.

4377
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:03,980
Oh my god.

4378
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:05,260
Oh my god.

4379
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:05,280
Oh my god.

4380
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:06,260
I hit himself.

4381
02:41:07,420 --> 02:41:07,980
Very good.

4382
02:41:08,820 --> 02:41:09,320
Stupid.

4383
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:11,140
Whoa.

4384
02:41:14,300 --> 02:41:15,860
How did you get over?

4385
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:18,120
Sound like a monkey in the wild.

4386
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:19,780
Oh my god.

4387
02:41:20,620 --> 02:41:22,380
What's going on over here?

4388
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:25,260
Ah!

4389
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:26,560
Ah!

4390
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:26,920

02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:27,420
Ah!

4392
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:34,560
Come on, man.

4393
02:41:44,930 --> 02:41:49,210
I fell and I died, but I'm here and it's fine.

4394
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:50,050
We're here now.

4395
02:41:53,230 --> 02:41:54,550
Jump on my head.

4396
02:41:55,850 --> 02:41:57,390
Oh, I still have a knife for some reason.

4397
02:41:58,490 --> 02:42:00,230
Why have a knife?

4398
02:42:01,550 --> 02:42:02,130
Okay, jump.

4399
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:03,210
Wait.

4400
02:42:03,670 --> 02:42:03,670
Yeah.

02:42:04,370 --> 02:42:05,570
Okay, get up.

Get up.

4405
02:42:07,950 --> 02:42:08,150
Get up.

4406
02:42:08,150 --> 02:42:08,230
Get up.

4407
02:42:08,890 --> 02:42:10,410
You get it.

4408
02:42:10,570 --> 02:42:10,870
You get it.

4409
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:11,010
You get it.

4410
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:11,850
Oh, you got it.

4411
02:42:12,050 --> 02:42:12,190
You got it.

4412
02:42:12,390 --> 02:42:12,550
Okay.

4413
02:42:12,930 --> 02:42:13,650
Now what?

4414
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:16,490
Jump onto the...

4415
02:42:17,890 --> 02:42:18,810
Oh, oh, I see.

4416
02:42:18,830 --> 02:42:19,030
Yeah.

4417
02:42:19,970 --> 02:42:20,810
Oh my god.

4418
02:42:21,810 --> 02:42:22,690
Okay, close.

4419
02:42:23,590 --> 02:42:23,930
Okay.

4420
02:42:26,350 --> 02:42:26,810
Ow.

4421
02:42:27,090 --> 02:42:27,190
Ow.

4422
02:42:31,970 --> 02:42:33,810
It requires a finesse.

4423
02:42:34,970 --> 02:42:35,310
Okay.

4424
02:42:35,690 --> 02:42:35,950
Oh!

4425
02:42:36,970 --> 02:42:37,270
Okay.

4426
02:42:38,050 --> 02:42:39,010
I think you can climb...

4427
02:42:40,690 --> 02:42:41,410
Can you...

4428
02:42:41,410 --> 02:42:49,590
It requires a certain lady's touch.

4429
02:42:49,910 --> 02:42:50,370
Uh...

4430
02:42:50,370 --> 02:42:51,150
Uh...

4431
02:42:51,150 --> 02:42:55,150
You gotta stop talking, man.

4432
02:42:58,850 --> 02:43:00,210
You got this?

4433
02:43:00,270 --> 02:43:01,890
Go, go, go, go up.

4434
02:43:02,250 --> 02:43:02,810
Okay.

4435
02:43:04,010 --> 02:43:04,610
Oops.

4436
02:43:04,930 --> 02:43:05,590
Oh, good bye.

4437
02:43:05,690 --> 02:43:07,110
Oh, God, no.

4438
02:43:08,250 --> 02:43:08,550
No!

4439
02:43:09,350 --> 02:43:09,750
No!

4440
02:43:10,910 --> 02:43:11,550
That

4441
02:43:15,900 --> 02:43:16,820
is so terrible.

4442
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:18,060
Okay.

4443
02:43:18,680 --> 02:43:19,580
This one's hard.

4444
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:21,620
This is, like, actual hard, man.

4445
02:43:21,860 --> 02:43:23,480
It, like, jumped up and...

4446
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:23,960
What's that?

4447
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:25,080
What's that?

4448
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:26,860
I don't know.

4449
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:28,820
What is that?

4450
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:32,280
A little something something.

4451
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:34,920
Wait, is that the song?

4452
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:43,680
What song is so important if you're making up a song.

4453
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:44,380
I know.

4454
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:46,900
Wait, what are you saying right now?

4455
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:47,820
What are you saying?

4456
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:52,480
We'll take back the regular minto.

4457
02:43:53,960 --> 02:43:55,680
Who are you?

4458
02:43:58,600 --> 02:43:59,400
Okay.

4459
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:00,220
Oops.

4460
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:04,120
How are we overthinking this?

4461
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:04,800
Like...

4462
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:08,840
No, you're supposed to, like, go through the thingies...

4463
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:11,920
Yeah, you're supposed to go through the thingies...

4464
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:12,780
Oops.

4465
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:14,420
Like, one at a time.

4466
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,540
Like, threading the...

4467
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:16,360
Like, Flappy Bird.

4468
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:17,720
You're supposed to Flappy Bird.

4469
02:44:19,500 --> 02:44:20,620
I'm pretty sure.

4470
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:23,420
Flappy Bird.

4471
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:24,920
You have Flappy Bird on your...

4472
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:27,180
Flappy Bird!

4473
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:28,200
You know, Flappy Bird!

4474
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:29,900
Flappy Bird!

4475
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:30,800
Flappy Bird, man!

4476
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:31,600
Flappy Bird!

4477
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:34,080
You know, Flappy Bird!

4478
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:36,520
Oops.

4479
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:37,340
Ow.

4480
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:38,200
Oh, my God.

4481
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:42,400
It keeps putting me underneath the spikes because it hates me.

4482
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:45,260
Yeah, I don't, this is tough.

4483
02:44:47,820 --> 02:44:53,980
Guys, welcome to the finale of Battle Block Theater where it's just us on this screen for 30 minutes until we stop playing.

4484
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:55,080
Is that what it is?

4485
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:59,080
I just double jump to control my jump a little bit more.

4486
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:00,500
Yeah, but it's hard.

4487
02:45:01,340 --> 02:45:02,320
It is tough.

4488
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:05,800
You're supposed to Mega Man this what does that mean?

4489
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:06,660
Make a million!

4490
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:07,160
Make a million!

4491
02:45:07,400 --> 02:45:09,320
That means, like, really platform.

4492
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:15,780
It means I'm money smart, not book smart.

4493
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:17,280
Makes me more intelligent.

4494
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:19,260
Ah.

4495
02:45:20,060 --> 02:45:20,580
No.

4496
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:23,240
Hey!

4497
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:24,740
What?

4498
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:25,040
No.

4499
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:26,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4500
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:28,540
Wait, hold on.

4501
02:45:28,820 --> 02:45:29,140
Ow.

4502
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:35,360
Uh, oh.

4503
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:42,780
I see the vision.

4504
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:44,480
I just think the skill is.

4505
02:45:44,500 --> 02:45:45,500
is not...

4506
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:51,240
No!

4507
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:54,800
Wait, why didn't you put it there again and it saves us a step?

4508
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:56,840
I can't get the second...

4509
02:45:56,840 --> 02:46:00,300
No, you can just do the one and we can just jump over top of it.

4510
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:02,620
Oh, oh, oh, you're right.

4511
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:06,360
Oh my gosh, this is so tough!

4512
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:07,780
Oops.

4513
02:46:08,620 --> 02:46:10,620
Oh my god, that's what I'm saying.

4514
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:14,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, jump in my head.

4515
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:20,580
Okay, okay.

4516
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:23,760
Now...

4517
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:42,360
Only one of us has to make it though.

4518
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,880
Wait, let me jump on your head again.

4519
02:46:45,140 --> 02:46:46,760
Oh, you made it.

4520
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:47,240
Oops.

4521
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:51,920
I don't know how I got the edge, the edge glitch.

4522
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:52,460
I know.

4523
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:55,020
Oh my gosh.

4524
02:46:56,420 --> 02:46:56,580
Ow.

4525
02:46:57,240 --> 02:46:57,480
Ow.

4526
02:46:57,600 --> 02:46:57,840
Sorry.

4527
02:46:58,200 --> 02:46:58,840
Oh, sorry.

4528
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:00,960
We are...

4529
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:01,960
You think we're gonna get this?

4530
02:47:01,980 --> 02:47:02,720
time on this?

4531
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:05,720
I think we might get, like, negative time.

4532
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:06,480
Oh, dang it.

4533
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:07,740
I was trying to get it, too.

4534
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:10,300
Oops.

4535
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:12,360
Wait, what if...

4536
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:13,400
What am I getting hit by?

4537
02:47:13,720 --> 02:47:14,020
Yeah?

4538
02:47:14,460 --> 02:47:17,240
What if we both were on the thing at the same time?

4539
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:19,440
What thing?

4540
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:20,040
This thing?

4541
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:22,120
No, the fire block.

4542
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:23,080
Oh, this thing.

4543
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:23,380
Okay.

4544
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:24,720
Oops.

4545
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:25,840
If I could get there.

02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:27,820
Okay, okay, you got it.

02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:30,080

02:49:13,910 --> 02:49:14,250
Okay.

Oh my god.

02:49:23,470 --> 02:49:24,610
Oh, wait, where am I?

4584
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:25,630
Oh, ouch.

Okay.

4586
02:49:28,550 --> 02:49:29,470
Oh, you got the hat.

4587
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:31,590
Oh, I died.

4588
02:49:32,450 --> 02:49:33,210
Don't let the hat.

4589
02:49:33,370 --> 02:49:34,330
Don't let the hat die.

4590
02:49:37,810 --> 02:49:38,170
No.

4591
02:49:39,070 --> 02:49:39,810
I think only...

4592
02:49:39,810 --> 02:49:42,490
I think it only dies if you're, if you go into the water.

4593
02:49:43,250 --> 02:49:43,470
Yeah.

4594
02:49:43,690 --> 02:49:43,930
Well.

4595
02:49:44,950 --> 02:49:46,450
Okay, I'm gonna try.

4596
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:48,050
Let me try!

4597
02:49:48,910 --> 02:49:49,270
No!

4598
02:49:51,610 --> 02:49:52,550
I want the hug!

4599
02:49:52,630 --> 02:49:54,030
Oh, I pressed the wrong button anyway.

4600
02:49:56,670 --> 02:49:57,650
Ah, damn it.

4601
02:49:57,850 --> 02:49:58,690
Got it.

4602
02:50:09,370 --> 02:50:11,190
I've planted myself here.

4603
02:50:14,890 --> 02:50:16,710
Do we get all the jewels though?

4604
02:50:17,050 --> 02:50:17,390
I think?

4605
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:18,290
Oh, no, we did it.

4606
02:50:18,310 --> 02:50:19,050
Oh, no, there's one there.

4607
02:50:19,510 --> 02:50:19,870
There's one there.

4608
02:50:19,890 --> 02:50:20,330
I can get it.

4609
02:50:20,390 --> 02:50:20,770
I can get it.

4610
02:50:23,190 --> 02:50:25,130
You don't want to lose your precious hand.

4611
02:50:25,330 --> 02:50:25,750
I know.

4612
02:50:26,110 --> 02:50:27,690
I haven't had one the whole stream.

4613
02:50:29,150 --> 02:50:30,050
I didn't either.

4614
02:50:32,970 --> 02:50:33,890
You got this?

4615
02:50:34,090 --> 02:50:35,010

02:50:36,870 --> 02:50:37,490
Okay, okay, okay.

02:50:37,710 --> 02:50:37,930
Let's go.

4620
02:50:38,170 --> 02:50:38,450
Let's go.

4621
02:50:43,530 --> 02:50:44,490
Oh, my God.

4622
02:50:45,810 --> 02:50:46,570
Oh, my God.

4623
02:50:46,650 --> 02:50:47,170
You got it?

4624
02:50:47,210 --> 02:50:47,630
I'm trying.

4625
02:50:47,770 --> 02:50:48,410
You got it?

4626
02:50:48,470 --> 02:50:48,870
I'm trying.

4627
02:50:49,430 --> 02:50:49,830
You got it?

4628
02:50:49,890 --> 02:50:51,670
Why is there water right in front?

4629
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:52,430
Oh, my gosh.

4630
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:54,510
No, no, you're not gonna die.

4631
02:50:54,610 --> 02:50:54,890
It's okay.

It was all due to your powers, everybody.

4639
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:42,480
And whoever said, I don't, I hope you don't play the lottery.

4640
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:47,580
How long were we on that one level?

4641
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:51,360
I know, that took, I feel like that took like an hour, man.

Oh, okay.

4657
02:52:20,400 --> 02:52:21,380
You gotta die?

4658
02:52:21,780 --> 02:52:22,740
Oh, you blocked us.

4659
02:52:22,940 --> 02:52:23,580
You blocked us.

4660
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:24,720

02:52:34,220 --> 02:52:36,780

4668
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:37,900

02:54:44,060 --> 02:54:44,620
Wait, not yet!

4734
02:54:55,190 --> 02:54:56,850
She's trying to kill me!

4735
02:54:57,210 --> 02:54:59,270
That was a mistake!

4736
02:55:00,270 --> 02:55:01,530
Alright, stay there, stay there.

4737
02:55:01,830 --> 02:55:02,130
Okay.

4738
02:55:02,910 --> 02:55:04,210
Wait, maybe not?

4739
02:55:04,830 --> 02:55:05,850
Wait, how do we...

4740
02:55:07,350 --> 02:55:07,490
Oh.

4741
02:55:10,770 --> 02:55:11,170
Maybe...

4742
02:55:11,830 --> 02:55:13,110
Come on, this one maybe?

4743
02:55:16,130 --> 02:55:16,330
Yeah.

4744
02:55:17,590 --> 02:55:18,510
Just run for it.

4745
02:55:18,590 --> 02:55:19,370
Yeah, just run for it.

4746
02:55:19,570 --> 02:55:19,790
Yeah, yeah.

4747
02:55:21,390 --> 02:55:21,790
Oops.

4748
02:55:22,450 --> 02:55:22,630
Oh.

4749
02:55:23,370 --> 02:55:24,990
Wait, we missed so much though.

4750
02:55:25,870 --> 02:55:26,270
Yeah.

4751
02:55:27,750 --> 02:55:28,550
I don't know.

4752
02:55:28,950 --> 02:55:30,390
I mean, maybe there's only five.

4753
02:55:33,150 --> 02:55:33,550
Maybe?

4754
02:55:33,830 --> 02:55:35,710
No, there's definitely more.

4755
02:55:36,150 --> 02:55:37,910
I think there was something that we missed.

4756
02:55:38,290 --> 02:55:38,610
It's fine.

4757
02:55:38,850 --> 02:55:39,490
We can't go back.

4758
02:55:39,650 --> 02:55:40,550
We can just go, yeah.

4759
02:55:41,150 --> 02:55:41,950
Nah, it's fine.

4760
02:55:42,130 --> 02:55:42,230
Whatever.

4761
02:55:42,350 --> 02:55:43,010
We're rich.

4762
02:55:43,090 --> 02:55:44,270
We're rich, man.

4763
02:55:44,410 --> 02:55:45,490
We don't need any more money.

4764
02:55:45,490 --> 02:55:47,730
There was something in, like, the top right, but that's okay.

4765
02:55:48,710 --> 02:55:49,030
Oh.

4766
02:55:49,150 --> 02:55:49,750
Did we get the ball?

4767
02:55:50,270 --> 02:55:51,170
Yeah, I got it.

4768
02:55:51,410 --> 02:55:52,630
That's when you tried to kill me.

4769
02:55:52,670 --> 02:55:53,710
Okay, I think it's fine.

4770
02:55:53,830 --> 02:55:54,490
Oh, we missed two.

4771
02:55:54,510 --> 02:55:55,270
Yeah, we missed two.

4772
02:55:57,610 --> 02:55:58,010
Oopsie.

4773
02:55:58,270 --> 02:55:58,670
Oopsie.

4774
02:55:59,010 --> 02:55:59,890
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

4775
02:55:59,930 --> 02:56:00,290
All right.

Oh, how do you do this?

03:00:42,520 --> 03:00:42,580
But there's spikes.

4914
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:45,060
But then...

Like, shoot the guns.

4958
03:02:59,560 --> 03:02:59,920
Okay, okay.

4959
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:02,400
And then we only have to time him when he's over on the other side.

4960
03:03:03,700 --> 03:03:03,960
Okay.

4961
03:03:06,400 --> 03:03:06,840
Like...

4962
03:03:06,840 --> 03:03:08,160
Oh, well, I missed.

4963
03:03:18,990 --> 03:03:20,450
Oh, so close.

4964
03:03:20,670 --> 03:03:22,710
Dude, those claws are so insane.

4965
03:03:22,870 --> 03:03:24,010
You think this is gonna give out?

4966
03:03:24,130 --> 03:03:24,970
Oh, no!

4967
03:03:26,370 --> 03:03:27,050
Ah, no!

4968
03:03:30,230 --> 03:03:31,750
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4969
03:03:32,630 --> 03:03:33,590
You got it, you got it.

4970
03:03:33,730 --> 03:03:34,730
Oh, nice, you got it!

4971
03:03:34,870 --> 03:03:36,670
I got it!

4972
03:03:37,690 --> 03:03:39,250
You can make it!

4973
03:03:39,370 --> 03:03:39,810
Oh, I did!

4974
03:03:40,270 --> 03:03:40,330
Yeah!

4975
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:44,510
Wait, your turn.

4976
03:03:54,220 --> 03:03:58,360
No, it's just like the way you set it in the punch really got me.

4977
03:04:03,340 --> 03:04:05,660
Oh my goodness gracious.

4978
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:06,560
I'm gonna...

4979
03:04:06,560 --> 03:04:07,520
I'm gonna...

4980
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:08,000
I'm gonna die!

4981
03:04:08,320 --> 03:04:08,720
I'm gonna die!

4982
03:04:09,060 --> 03:04:09,220
Ah!

4983
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:09,820
No, no!

4984
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:10,600
Okay, don't die!

4985
03:04:12,180 --> 03:04:12,620
Oh,

4986
03:04:15,750 --> 03:04:15,890
okay.

4987
03:04:19,850 --> 03:04:20,730
Oh, okay.

4988
03:04:20,810 --> 03:04:21,250
Alright.

4989
03:04:21,650 --> 03:04:21,870
Oops.

4990
03:04:23,050 --> 03:04:23,630
Oh, cool.

4991
03:04:24,030 --> 03:04:24,530
Thank you.

4992
03:04:24,650 --> 03:04:24,870
Okay.

4993
03:04:25,110 --> 03:04:25,750
What is this?

4994
03:04:25,910 --> 03:04:27,090
Oh, you go the other way, I think.

4995
03:04:27,190 --> 03:04:27,590
Okay, okay.

4996
03:04:28,510 --> 03:04:29,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4997
03:04:31,370 --> 03:04:31,810
Oh!

4998
03:04:33,970 --> 03:04:34,410
Okay,

4999
03:04:40,580 --> 03:04:41,280
that wasn't on me.

5000
03:04:41,360 --> 03:04:42,280
That wasn't on me.

5001
03:04:42,600 --> 03:04:45,700
Okay, I thought you were pressing the button, not...

5002
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:46,600
No, no!

5003
03:04:46,780 --> 03:04:47,760
Okay, now you go.

5004
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:52,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5005
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:55,380
Okay, okay.

5006
03:04:56,620 --> 03:04:57,080
Okay, okay, okay.

5007
03:04:59,460 --> 03:04:59,900
Oh!

5008
03:05:00,560 --> 03:05:01,840
Oh, no, what the heck?

5009
03:05:01,960 --> 03:05:02,520
Oh, oh, oh.

5010
03:05:04,320 --> 03:05:05,180
Oh, my God.

5011
03:05:05,260 --> 03:05:05,960
Oh, my God.

5012
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:08,860
Okay, just don't stop pressing the button.

5013
03:05:09,800 --> 03:05:13,140
Maybe sometimes, stop pressing the button.

5014
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:15,060
Actually, how do we get in here?

5015
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:16,140
Is this the secret here?

5016
03:05:16,940 --> 03:05:17,380
No.

5017
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:20,360
I think it's, like, over...

5018
03:05:20,360 --> 03:05:21,180
Over...

5019
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:22,800
Maybe...

5020
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:23,460
Wait.

5021
03:05:23,600 --> 03:05:24,860
Oh, I think it's in that hole.

5022
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:26,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5023
03:05:27,700 --> 03:05:28,060
Uh-oh.

5024
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:32,580
Am I...

5025
03:05:32,580 --> 03:05:33,340
Oh, hello.

5026
03:05:33,460 --> 03:05:33,600
Hello.

5027
03:05:37,720 --> 03:05:38,160
Alright.

5028
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:42,500
You're so stupid!

5029
03:05:43,180 --> 03:05:43,620
Oh my god.

5030
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:44,380
Oh my god.

5031
03:05:44,460 --> 03:05:44,940
Oh god.

5032
03:05:45,660 --> 03:05:45,780
Oh god.

5033
03:05:46,460 --> 03:05:46,760
Oh god.

5034
03:05:46,760 --> 03:05:48,560
No, I want the jetpack back.

5035
03:05:49,900 --> 03:05:51,360
We don't need the jetpack.

5036
03:05:51,860 --> 03:05:52,200
I do.

5037
03:05:52,340 --> 03:05:52,480
Oh wait.

5038
03:05:52,480 --> 03:05:53,880
Maybe we do need the jetpack.

5039
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:57,000
No, we don't need the jetpack.

5040
03:05:57,280 --> 03:05:58,400
Oh, I keep dying anyway.

5041
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:00,240
Oh, you got it already?

5042
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:00,580
Okay.

5043
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:01,980
Yeah, I got it.

5044
03:06:02,820 --> 03:06:03,820
We don't need the jetpack.

5045
03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:04,760
Why did I do that?

5046
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:07,200
Oh wait.

5047
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:11,160
We need to go over there.

5048
03:06:11,300 --> 03:06:11,620
Go.

5049
03:06:12,280 --> 03:06:12,920
You got...

5050
03:06:12,920 --> 03:06:13,920
Okay, one more try.

5051
03:06:14,380 --> 03:06:14,900
One more time.

5052
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:15,160
Okay.

5053
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:16,020
Okay, okay.

5054
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:17,300
Go.

5055
03:06:18,380 --> 03:06:18,860
Nice.

5056
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:19,600
Okay.

5057
03:06:20,540 --> 03:06:21,020
Okay, nice.

5058
03:06:22,300 --> 03:06:22,780
Yeah.

5059
03:06:22,780 --> 03:06:22,800
All right.

5060
03:06:23,320 --> 03:06:24,380
Yeah, we're killing it.

5061
03:06:24,400 --> 03:06:25,500
We're killing it and each other.

5062
03:06:25,660 --> 03:06:26,140
We're doing it.

5063
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:26,880
We're doing it.

5064
03:06:28,240 --> 03:06:28,720
Uh...

5065
03:06:28,720 --> 03:06:29,300
Ooh!

5066
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:30,820
Wow.

5067
03:06:31,540 --> 03:06:32,580
Oh, that's tough.

5068
03:06:33,860 --> 03:06:35,440
Okay, there's a jewel over there.

5069
03:06:37,940 --> 03:06:38,420
Oh.

5070
03:06:38,660 --> 03:06:38,840
Okay.

5071
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:40,200
I took it for you.

5072
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:41,280
I tanked it for you.

5073
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:42,760
Thank you, thank you.

5074
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:44,120
Oh wait, shit.

5075
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:45,180
Can't swim.

5076
03:06:46,080 --> 03:06:47,260
Wait, where did it put... Oh, yeah.

5077
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:48,700
Hello?

5078
03:06:49,900 --> 03:06:50,580
It...

5079
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:50,920
Okay.

5080
03:06:57,670 --> 03:06:58,350
Team!

5081
03:07:00,590 --> 03:07:01,270
Team!

5082
03:07:03,190 --> 03:07:04,650
Is my team cooked?

5083
03:07:06,550 --> 03:07:09,630
The kids might call us chopped.

5084
03:07:10,670 --> 03:07:11,590
No, shh!

5085
03:07:15,170 --> 03:07:16,530
Chat, am I chopped?

5086
03:07:18,290 --> 03:07:19,510
Chat, are we cooked?

5087
03:07:20,430 --> 03:07:21,030
We got it.

5088
03:07:21,050 --> 03:07:21,430
We got it.

5089
03:07:21,630 --> 03:07:21,930
We got it.

5090
03:07:22,010 --> 03:07:22,230
We got it.

5091
03:07:22,230 --> 03:07:22,230
We got it.

5092
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:22,450
We got it.

5093
03:07:22,450 --> 03:07:22,630
We got it.

5094
03:07:23,030 --> 03:07:23,150
Okay.

5095
03:07:24,510 --> 03:07:25,330
Oh, you got it?

5096
03:07:25,870 --> 03:07:26,590
Yeah, I got it.

5097
03:07:26,690 --> 03:07:26,910
I got it.

5098
03:07:27,190 --> 03:07:27,590
Yippee!

5099
03:07:28,170 --> 03:07:28,170
You're fine.

5100
03:07:28,290 --> 03:07:28,630
You're fine.

5101
03:07:28,910 --> 03:07:30,230
Cooked, chopped, washed.

5102
03:07:31,250 --> 03:07:31,850
It's over.

5103
03:07:32,030 --> 03:07:33,170
No, I'm not chopped.

5104
03:07:34,410 --> 03:07:37,570
We're all sorts of adjectives you wouldn't even imagine, man.

5105
03:07:39,330 --> 03:07:39,730
Flambade.

5106
03:07:41,750 --> 03:07:42,150
Flambade.

5107
03:07:43,850 --> 03:07:44,870
Oh, I made it.

5108
03:07:45,170 --> 03:07:48,450
Things must be chopped and cooked before they can be eaten and served.

5109
03:07:48,730 --> 03:07:49,310
That's true.

5110
03:07:50,090 --> 03:07:51,290
I'm always serving.

5111
03:07:52,530 --> 03:07:54,550
Why did it put me down up there?

5112
03:07:54,970 --> 03:07:55,650
Okay, thank you.

5113
03:07:55,690 --> 03:07:56,550
Oh my god.

5114
03:07:56,910 --> 03:07:57,270
Okay.

5115
03:07:57,830 --> 03:08:00,910
Oh my god, wait, this is messed up.

5116
03:08:01,770 --> 03:08:02,130
How?

5117
03:08:03,690 --> 03:08:05,050
I literally made it.

5118
03:08:05,050 --> 03:08:06,310
Wait, oh, there's the...

5119
03:08:06,470 --> 03:08:06,870
There's a...

5120
03:08:06,870 --> 03:08:07,090
Yeah.

5121
03:08:07,410 --> 03:08:08,010
I see it.

5122
03:08:08,390 --> 03:08:09,210
I got it.

5123
03:08:10,130 --> 03:08:11,130
I don't got it.

5124
03:08:12,530 --> 03:08:13,610
You got it.

5125
03:08:14,570 --> 03:08:26,110
I don't Oh, okay, over there Nice, she's gaming I don't know how you get the ball though How do you get the ball?

5127
03:08:33,610 --> 03:08:36,570
You're drowning It's okay Get it, get it, get it!

5128
03:08:36,990 --> 03:08:37,410
Get it!

5129
03:08:37,730 --> 03:08:38,510
Wait, why aren't you?

5130
03:08:38,750 --> 03:08:40,490
See, it happened to me too!

5131
03:08:40,630 --> 03:08:41,330
It happened to me too!

5132
03:08:42,010 --> 03:08:43,210
It's tough, it's tough.

5133
03:08:45,070 --> 03:08:45,870
Alright.

5134
03:08:46,270 --> 03:08:47,270
Guys, don't say...

5135
03:08:47,270 --> 03:08:52,850
We just want a B for Barry, okay?

5136
03:08:53,210 --> 03:08:56,050
B for Barry Bog.

5137
03:08:57,090 --> 03:08:58,530
B for Barry Bog.

5138
03:08:59,510 --> 03:09:01,590
B for everyone.

5139
03:09:01,990 --> 03:09:05,410
F for...

5140
03:09:05,410 --> 03:09:09,550
What is it for?

5141
03:09:10,590 --> 03:09:11,390
Phantom!

5142
03:09:12,510 --> 03:09:14,270
Yeah, Phantom!

5143
03:09:16,250 --> 03:09:16,690
Oh!

5144
03:09:17,090 --> 03:09:18,450
I didn't know what you were doing.

5145
03:09:19,150 --> 03:09:21,150
I was like, why are you posing like that?

5146
03:09:21,350 --> 03:09:23,350
I was just aura farming.

5147
03:09:25,150 --> 03:09:25,850
Oh my gosh!

5148
03:09:25,950 --> 03:09:27,310
I can't do the double job!

5149
03:09:29,170 --> 03:09:30,030
There you go.

5150
03:09:30,270 --> 03:09:30,310
Okay.

5151
03:09:31,170 --> 03:09:31,630
Uh-oh.

5152
03:09:34,090 --> 03:09:34,530
Uh.

5153
03:09:34,530 --> 03:09:35,370
I don't think...

5154
03:09:35,370 --> 03:09:36,230
Oh wait, I got it!

5155
03:09:36,270 --> 03:09:37,270
Okay, okay, you jump?

5156
03:09:37,670 --> 03:09:38,630
Oh, or not.

5157
03:09:39,090 --> 03:09:39,090
Whatever.

5158
03:09:39,390 --> 03:09:40,290
Do it properly.

5159
03:09:40,610 --> 03:09:41,630
Oh wait, do it properly.

5160
03:09:42,050 --> 03:09:42,490
Ah!

5161
03:09:42,550 --> 03:09:42,770
Ah!

5162
03:09:43,050 --> 03:09:43,290
Ah!

5163
03:09:45,880 --> 03:09:46,420
Oh shit.

5164
03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:46,720
Ah!

5165
03:09:48,180 --> 03:09:50,020
No, no, no, no, no!

5166
03:09:50,260 --> 03:09:51,400
Oh, she made it!

5167
03:09:51,960 --> 03:09:52,760
I made it.

5168
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:01,820
Oh shit.

5169
03:10:02,520 --> 03:10:03,500
Send me over.

5170
03:10:04,660 --> 03:10:08,980
No, no, no, you're supposed, I think you're supposed to, like, you know, the...

5171
03:10:08,980 --> 03:10:09,900
Like the...

5172
03:10:09,900 --> 03:10:10,840
Yeah, yeah, time it.

5173
03:10:11,700 --> 03:10:12,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5174
03:10:12,540 --> 03:10:13,640
You just gotta be good at it.

5175
03:10:13,740 --> 03:10:14,520
You just gotta be good.

5176
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:16,000
You just gotta be good at it.

5177
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:17,280
You just gotta do it.

5178
03:10:17,560 --> 03:10:18,900
You just gotta be good at it.

5179
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:19,620
You just gotta be...

5180
03:10:19,620 --> 03:10:20,320
Wait, hold on.

5181
03:10:21,260 --> 03:10:21,620
Okay.

5182
03:10:21,620 --> 03:10:22,600
Wait, hold on.

5183
03:10:22,640 --> 03:10:23,180
Wait, hold on.

5184
03:10:23,460 --> 03:10:23,480
Wait.

5185
03:10:24,400 --> 03:10:25,520
Wait, it's tough!

5186
03:10:27,380 --> 03:10:28,020
Okay, chief.

5187
03:10:28,260 --> 03:10:28,440
Oh!

5188
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:32,060
Not anything else!

5189
03:10:34,520 --> 03:10:36,240
Okay, okay, I got it.

5190
03:10:37,100 --> 03:10:37,620
I die!

5191
03:10:39,040 --> 03:10:39,800
Hey, hey, hey.

5192
03:10:40,340 --> 03:10:41,180
Do it properly.

5193
03:10:42,120 --> 03:10:42,140
Okay.

5194
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:42,380
Wait.

5195
03:10:42,380 --> 03:10:43,360
Do it properly.

5196
03:10:43,380 --> 03:10:45,180
Wait, how am I supposed to jump up there?

5197
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:49,080
Do it properly.

5198
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:50,240
Hey.

5199
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:51,380
I've tried.

5200
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:51,880
Hey.

5201
03:10:52,520 --> 03:10:52,940
Lisa.

5202
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:54,540
I can't jump any higher.

5203
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:55,660
Lisa.

5204
03:10:56,480 --> 03:10:56,880
Lisa.

5205
03:10:57,640 --> 03:11:02,120
Sir, I actually cannot jump the appropriate amount to be able to continue.

5206
03:11:09,850 --> 03:11:11,190
Okay, I'm going to die now.

5207
03:11:12,070 --> 03:11:12,550
All right.

5208
03:11:13,710 --> 03:11:14,050
Wait!

5209
03:11:22,920 --> 03:11:23,840
Do it properly.

5210
03:11:24,100 --> 03:11:25,380
Wait, how did you get up there?

5211
03:11:26,860 --> 03:11:27,740
Double jump.

5212
03:11:28,020 --> 03:11:28,780
I did too.

5213
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:31,320
I don't think you did it well.

5214
03:11:32,880 --> 03:11:34,040
That's what I...

5215
03:11:34,040 --> 03:11:36,080
Man, he's bull.

5216
03:11:36,660 --> 03:11:38,060
Oh, like that.

5217
03:11:38,720 --> 03:11:39,580
I'm begging you.

5218
03:11:41,940 --> 03:11:42,380
Mint.

5219
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:46,960
Fireball.

5220
03:11:49,280 --> 03:11:49,720
Fireball.

5221
03:11:57,390 --> 03:11:59,330
Okay, I think I...

5222
03:11:59,330 --> 03:12:01,230
I got the jewels.

5223
03:12:01,530 --> 03:12:01,970
You done?

5224
03:12:02,810 --> 03:12:03,110
Oh, wait.

5225
03:12:03,230 --> 03:12:03,610
Oh, no, no, no.

5226
03:12:03,730 --> 03:12:04,950
On your side, there's one.

5227
03:12:05,770 --> 03:12:06,210
There is?

5228
03:12:06,290 --> 03:12:06,510
Okay.

5229
03:12:06,690 --> 03:12:07,230
You got it.

5230
03:12:07,230 --> 03:12:07,810
Yeah, you got it.

5231
03:12:08,410 --> 03:12:09,270
You got that, right?

5232
03:12:09,290 --> 03:12:11,380
Oh, oh, no you don't.

5233
03:12:11,990 --> 03:12:13,450
Oh, that's evil.

5234
03:12:14,070 --> 03:12:14,850
That's evil.

5235
03:12:15,610 --> 03:12:17,110
Maybe you need me to do that.

5236
03:12:17,250 --> 03:12:19,350
I don't need nobody in my afterlife.

5237
03:12:19,590 --> 03:12:20,370
Why are you killing me?

5238
03:12:20,470 --> 03:12:22,050
This is why I don't need anybody.

5239
03:12:22,430 --> 03:12:24,610
Because all they do is disappoint you.

5240
03:12:25,330 --> 03:12:26,510
What do you mean?

5241
03:12:29,850 --> 03:12:31,570
Someone's not a team player.

5242
03:12:33,350 --> 03:12:33,590
Okay.

5243
03:12:34,430 --> 03:12:35,330
Alright, okay.

5244
03:12:36,830 --> 03:12:38,410
I think I throw you over.

5245
03:12:38,710 --> 03:12:38,870
Okay.

5246
03:12:39,470 --> 03:12:39,870
No!

5247
03:12:41,650 --> 03:12:42,050
Oops.

5248
03:12:42,550 --> 03:12:43,770
How do you do that?

5249
03:12:45,170 --> 03:12:45,570
Hello.

5250
03:12:46,650 --> 03:12:47,930
Oh, maybe I don't jump.

5251
03:12:48,290 --> 03:12:48,450
Maybe...

5252
03:12:48,450 --> 03:12:49,050
Maybe...

5253
03:12:49,050 --> 03:12:50,550
Like, we gotta get closer, yeah.

5254
03:12:51,230 --> 03:12:52,650
Yeah, maybe you have to be at the edge.

5255
03:12:53,650 --> 03:12:54,530
Oh, why is...

5256
03:12:54,530 --> 03:12:55,790
I'm holding right trigger.

5257
03:12:55,890 --> 03:12:56,450
Why am I not?

5258
03:12:56,570 --> 03:12:56,690
Okay.

5259
03:12:57,350 --> 03:12:57,690
Okay.

5260
03:13:01,980 --> 03:13:02,200
Ah!

5261
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:03,000
Okay.

5262
03:13:04,200 --> 03:13:04,560
Throw me!

5263
03:13:05,820 --> 03:13:06,780
Oh, that wasn't...

5264
03:13:06,780 --> 03:13:07,200
Oh, sorry.

5265
03:13:07,380 --> 03:13:07,800
That wasn't...

5266
03:13:07,800 --> 03:13:08,660
No, I think it was me.

5267
03:13:08,760 --> 03:13:09,360
I didn't have enough free.

5268
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:12,340
Okay.

5269
03:13:12,920 --> 03:13:13,560
Alright, alright.

5270
03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:14,860
Here, I'll throw you.

5271
03:13:17,460 --> 03:13:18,340
Okay, okay.

5272
03:13:19,520 --> 03:13:19,960
Ah!

5273
03:13:20,240 --> 03:13:20,560
Oh!

5274
03:13:20,560 --> 03:13:21,000
We got it!

5275
03:13:21,060 --> 03:13:22,000
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

5276
03:13:23,160 --> 03:13:24,160
Let's get out of this hellhole.

5277

Oh my goodness gracious indeed!

Oh, come on, it's always the spikes.

03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:08,760
Or I jump off of you.

5330
03:16:09,400 --> 03:16:09,660
Okay.

5331
03:16:10,180 --> 03:16:10,860
There you go.

5332
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:11,980
Okay, I jumped.

5333
03:16:12,340 --> 03:16:12,500
Okay.

5334
03:16:13,400 --> 03:16:14,800
I don't see that every day.

5335
03:16:15,780 --> 03:16:16,180
Oh!

5336
03:16:16,480 --> 03:16:16,700
Oh!

5337
03:16:17,980 --> 03:16:19,440
Okay, I got this.

5338
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:20,500
I got this.

5339
03:16:21,240 --> 03:16:21,720
I got this.

5340
03:16:21,920 --> 03:16:22,840
One more time.

5341
03:16:23,080 --> 03:16:24,600
This one's for you, Liz.

5342
03:16:25,020 --> 03:16:25,500
Okay.

5343
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:26,040
Yeah.

5344
03:16:33,310 --> 03:16:34,590
I got you.

5345
03:16:34,730 --> 03:16:35,490
I got you.

5346
03:16:35,630 --> 03:16:35,990
You might...

5347
03:16:35,990 --> 03:16:36,390
Yeah, okay.

5348
03:16:36,650 --> 03:16:37,350
Okay, we're fine.

5349
03:16:41,380 --> 03:16:42,400
Oh, we got everything.

5350
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:43,980
Oh, oopsie.

5351
03:16:45,800 --> 03:16:46,020
Okay.

5352
03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:47,300
Okay.

5353
03:16:47,560 --> 03:16:48,700
Nice first try, yeah.

5354
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:49,740
Yeah, first try.

5355
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:51,600
First try, first try.

5356
03:16:52,280 --> 03:16:52,640
Good job.

5357
03:16:52,880 --> 03:16:53,080
Oh.

5358
03:16:55,120 --> 03:16:55,580
I...

5359
03:16:55,580 --> 03:16:57,400
Why would it put me there?

5360
03:16:58,060 --> 03:16:58,520
Why

5361
03:17:02,100 --> 03:17:03,580
would it put me there?

5362
03:17:09,570 --> 03:17:10,410
We did it!

5363
03:17:10,490 --> 03:17:10,950
Yippee!

5364
03:17:12,930 --> 03:17:15,710
Oh my goodness, yeah, first try, first try.

5365
03:17:16,290 --> 03:17:17,770
Thank you guys for all the gifts, thank you.

5366
03:17:18,790 --> 03:17:20,010
Thank you, thank you.

5367
03:17:20,250 --> 03:17:21,230
Oh my god.

5368
03:17:22,050 --> 03:17:23,550
Oh my goodness gracious.

5369
03:17:24,990 --> 03:17:25,870
Wait, do you kill?

5370
03:17:26,610 --> 03:17:27,450
Do you kill, right?

5371
03:17:28,030 --> 03:17:28,690
Yeah, kill.

5372
03:17:30,810 --> 03:17:32,170
Oh, that wasn't kill.

5373
03:17:33,090 --> 03:17:33,650
Stop.

5374
03:17:37,150 --> 03:17:37,430
Wait.

5375
03:17:41,120 --> 03:17:43,360
I went up one too far many.

5376
03:17:43,560 --> 03:17:44,460
Oh, they're all here?

5377
03:17:51,250 --> 03:17:52,130
Okay, okay.

5378
03:17:52,470 --> 03:17:52,810
I'm okay.

5379
03:17:53,910 --> 03:17:54,470
Everything's fine.

5380
03:17:55,270 --> 03:17:55,390
Yep.

5381
03:17:55,870 --> 03:17:56,290
Everything's fine.

5382
03:17:56,790 --> 03:17:56,950
Yep.

5383
03:17:57,330 --> 03:17:58,030
Everything's okay.

5384
03:17:58,330 --> 03:17:58,730
Everything's A-OK.

5385
03:17:59,130 --> 03:17:59,730
Everything's A-OK.

5386
03:18:02,390 --> 03:18:02,810
Okay.

5387
03:18:03,010 --> 03:18:03,470
I'm going.

5388
03:18:04,350 --> 03:18:05,250
I turned off something.

5389
03:18:06,190 --> 03:18:07,230
I'm still going.

5390
03:18:07,990 --> 03:18:08,170
Okay.

5391
03:18:08,190 --> 03:18:08,670
I'm going.

5392
03:18:09,530 --> 03:18:10,650
Okay, wake up the Kappa.

5393
03:18:11,110 --> 03:18:12,090
How do you, okay, okay.

5394
03:18:13,310 --> 03:18:14,610
Oh, wait, am I going the right way?

5395
03:18:15,330 --> 03:18:16,810
I think we were supposed to follow him.

5396
03:18:19,250 --> 03:18:19,510
Maybe.

5397
03:18:20,870 --> 03:18:21,270
Oh.

5398
03:18:21,770 --> 03:18:23,530
Oh my God, this is gracious.

5399
03:18:24,230 --> 03:18:24,570
Help!

5400
03:18:24,850 --> 03:18:24,950
Okay.

5401
03:18:25,670 --> 03:18:27,450
Help, wait, hold on.

5402
03:18:27,550 --> 03:18:27,790
Oh.

5403
03:18:29,870 --> 03:18:31,330
Like that, maybe?

5404
03:18:32,590 --> 03:18:32,890
What?

5405
03:18:33,190 --> 03:18:33,830
Oh, he's dead.

5406
03:18:34,090 --> 03:18:34,330
Where?

5407
03:18:39,070 --> 03:18:42,010
Oh, wait, oh, we're supposed to like ride on top of...

5408
03:18:42,010 --> 03:18:43,810
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5409
03:18:43,910 --> 03:18:44,810
Hold on.

5410
03:18:44,950 --> 03:18:47,430
Because he's supposed to like step on the thing?

5411
03:18:47,950 --> 03:18:49,050
Oh, yeah, he does.

5412
03:18:49,490 --> 03:18:51,030
Or what's going on here?

5413
03:18:52,070 --> 03:18:53,650
No, he just...

5414
03:18:53,650 --> 03:18:55,530
He dies after a while, I think.

5415
03:18:56,610 --> 03:18:56,870
Yeah.

5416
03:18:59,310 --> 03:18:59,750
Okay.

5417
03:19:02,430 --> 03:19:02,870
Uh...

5418
03:19:02,870 --> 03:19:04,110
Oh, oh, oh, goodbye.

5419
03:19:05,130 --> 03:19:07,090
How am I supposed to get on top of him?

5420
03:19:08,190 --> 03:19:09,010
I don't know.

5421
03:19:09,350 --> 03:19:09,490
Ah!

5422
03:19:12,190 --> 03:19:14,150
Okay, maybe let's not just go that way.

5423
03:19:14,350 --> 03:19:15,270
I think it's fine.

5424
03:19:15,570 --> 03:19:18,630
I don't think there's any other way to go.

5425
03:19:19,750 --> 03:19:21,050
Any other way to go?

5426
03:19:21,750 --> 03:19:22,690
Here, I'm gonna keep trying.

5427
03:19:22,770 --> 03:19:23,450
You try down there.

5428
03:19:23,550 --> 03:19:24,190
I try up here.

5429
03:19:25,070 --> 03:19:25,370
Okay.

5430
03:19:26,990 --> 03:19:27,430
Fireball.

5431
03:19:28,270 --> 03:19:29,270
I think I need you.

5432
03:19:29,930 --> 03:19:30,870
No, I need you.

5433
03:19:31,070 --> 03:19:31,610
I need you.

5434
03:19:32,010 --> 03:19:32,470
I need you.

5435
03:19:32,530 --> 03:19:33,490
Mint, I need you.

5436
03:19:33,710 --> 03:19:34,950
Oh, okay.

5437
03:19:35,110 --> 03:19:35,890
I need you.

5438
03:19:36,090 --> 03:19:37,170
You need me to throw you?

5439
03:19:37,210 --> 03:19:37,590
Lock the hook in.

5440
03:19:38,190 --> 03:19:39,830
No, can you press on the button?

5441
03:19:40,210 --> 03:19:40,710
Oh, okay.

5442
03:19:42,290 --> 03:19:42,650
Oops.

5443
03:19:47,110 --> 03:19:47,470
Ah!

5444
03:19:47,830 --> 03:19:48,630
I wasn't ready!

5445
03:19:49,090 --> 03:19:49,430
Okay.

5446
03:19:50,150 --> 03:19:50,570
One more?

5447
03:19:50,810 --> 03:19:50,830
Okay.

5448
03:19:51,470 --> 03:19:52,070
Yeah, one more.

5449
03:19:53,670 --> 03:19:54,150
Nice.

5450
03:19:54,690 --> 03:19:55,250
Very good.

5451
03:19:56,110 --> 03:19:56,870
Okay, there we go.

5452
03:19:57,270 --> 03:19:57,330
Yep.

5453
03:19:59,150 --> 03:19:59,870
Is it?

5454
03:20:00,330 --> 03:20:01,390
Or maybe we should...

5455
03:20:01,390 --> 03:20:01,590
Okay.

5456
03:20:02,070 --> 03:20:02,770
I think it's...

5457
03:20:02,770 --> 03:20:04,530
I think this is the right idea.

5458
03:20:04,630 --> 03:20:05,770
We just gotta...

5459
03:20:05,770 --> 03:20:06,850
I have no idea.

5460
03:20:07,470 --> 03:20:07,810
Oh, yeah.

5461
03:20:07,870 --> 03:20:08,170
I don't know.

5462
03:20:08,190 --> 03:20:08,530
I don't know.

5463
03:20:10,810 --> 03:20:14,130
Well, maybe, maybe it's not, maybe we don't use him.

5464
03:20:14,670 --> 03:20:15,510
I think we do.

5465
03:20:15,930 --> 03:20:16,730
Hold on.

5466
03:20:17,210 --> 03:20:17,890
Did so?

5467
03:20:19,670 --> 03:20:20,110
Oh!

5468
03:20:21,030 --> 03:20:24,690
But, but, but how do you, yeah, how do you get past the- Yeah, he dies.

5469
03:20:24,990 --> 03:20:25,690
There's no way.

5470
03:20:28,650 --> 03:20:30,650
Yeah, he's- oh, oh, he stops there.

5471
03:20:30,850 --> 03:20:31,990
Yeah, but then he dies.

5472
03:20:33,250 --> 03:20:33,890
What the?

5473
03:20:33,910 --> 03:20:34,030
Wow.

5474
03:20:35,230 --> 03:20:35,830
Is that you?

5475
03:20:36,170 --> 03:20:36,550
Ah!

5476
03:20:36,770 --> 03:20:37,450
Yeah, that was me.

5477
03:20:38,870 --> 03:20:40,010
Oh, okay.

5478
03:20:40,550 --> 03:20:41,630
Oh, sorry.

5479
03:20:56,140 --> 03:20:56,840
Go.

5480
03:20:57,680 --> 03:20:58,820
Oh, he's...

5481
03:21:00,100 --> 03:21:01,000
Okay, there we go.

5482
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:01,840
Go.

5483
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:05,700
Whoa.

5484
03:21:06,180 --> 03:21:06,360
Hello?

5485
03:21:08,400 --> 03:21:09,320
Don't move.

5486
03:21:09,560 --> 03:21:11,020
Just wait it out.

5487
03:21:12,040 --> 03:21:12,960
See what happens.

5488
03:21:13,900 --> 03:21:17,540
Oh, he does die.

5489
03:21:17,620 --> 03:21:18,080
What the?

5490
03:21:18,140 --> 03:21:19,260
What are we supposed to do then?

5491
03:21:19,640 --> 03:21:20,920
Yeah, he stops at the stop side.

5492
03:21:21,020 --> 03:21:22,460
I think I'm supposed to jump.

5493
03:21:22,980 --> 03:21:25,160
Or maybe we're supposed to both make it through?

5494
03:21:25,420 --> 03:21:25,940
I don't know.

5495
03:21:26,160 --> 03:21:27,040
I have no idea.

5496
03:21:27,380 --> 03:21:28,260
Oh, sorry.

5497
03:21:30,860 --> 03:21:31,220
Wait.

5498
03:21:35,890 --> 03:21:36,650
Wait, hold on.

5499
03:21:36,670 --> 03:21:37,690
I have no idea.

5500
03:21:39,250 --> 03:21:40,570
He dies from the sign.

5501
03:21:41,790 --> 03:21:43,530
Yeah, but like...

5502
03:21:45,470 --> 03:21:45,910
Eh?

5503
03:21:47,010 --> 03:21:47,450
Eh.

5504
03:21:48,750 --> 03:21:49,190
Huh?

5505
03:21:49,330 --> 03:21:49,710
Huh?

5506
03:21:55,930 --> 03:21:56,330
What?

5507
03:21:56,730 --> 03:21:59,830
Oh, he turns around and he eats you and shoots you!

5508
03:22:00,330 --> 03:22:01,590
Oh my god, right!

5509
03:22:03,570 --> 03:22:04,530
Okay, okay.

5510
03:22:05,790 --> 03:22:06,810
Oh my god!

5511
03:22:07,230 --> 03:22:08,250
Okay, there we go.

5512
03:22:08,450 --> 03:22:09,150
There we go.

5513
03:22:09,610 --> 03:22:11,290
Why didn't he turn around any other time?

5514
03:22:11,530 --> 03:22:12,170
I don't know.

5515
03:22:12,570 --> 03:22:14,050
He just decides to show us his booty.

5516
03:22:14,290 --> 03:22:15,690
All of a sudden he wants to turn around.

5517
03:22:15,830 --> 03:22:16,670
I think that probably...

5518
03:22:16,670 --> 03:22:17,190
There you go, yeah.

5519
03:22:17,390 --> 03:22:17,890
Go on up.

5520
03:22:18,190 --> 03:22:18,670
Oh, there you go.

5521
03:22:23,330 --> 03:22:24,330
Okay, nice.

5522
03:22:24,550 --> 03:22:24,650
Okay.

5523
03:22:25,850 --> 03:22:26,730
Jam, jam.

5524
03:22:27,570 --> 03:22:29,810
Oh god oh god oh god oh god.

5525
03:22:30,370 --> 03:22:30,730
Okay yeah.

5526
03:22:30,790 --> 03:22:31,350
We're fine.

5527
03:22:31,590 --> 03:22:31,790
Okay.

5528
03:22:38,810 --> 03:22:40,010
What is that?

5529
03:22:40,390 --> 03:22:41,920
I'm trying to get there but...

5530
03:22:42,410 --> 03:22:47,470
Oh that probably that probably when you go to the bottom it like probably sends you to the- Oh!

5531
03:22:47,550 --> 03:22:48,810
Probably like a loop.

5532
03:22:50,550 --> 03:22:50,830
Oh.

5533
03:22:51,110 --> 03:22:51,210
Oh.

5534
03:22:51,350 --> 03:22:51,710
Oh.

5535
03:22:51,830 --> 03:22:51,930
Oh.

5536
03:22:52,330 --> 03:22:52,410
Oh.

5537
03:22:52,550 --> 03:22:52,670
Oh.

5538
03:22:52,810 --> 03:22:55,050
Oh you are?

5539
03:22:55,210 --> 03:22:55,770
I'm stuck.

5540
03:22:56,370 --> 03:22:56,830
Oh you are?

5541
03:22:57,390 --> 03:22:58,070
I'm stuck!

5542
03:22:58,190 --> 03:22:59,210
No, you're not.

5543
03:22:59,930 --> 03:23:00,090
Oh, wait.

5544
03:23:00,470 --> 03:23:01,530
I have to DC my controller.

5545
03:23:01,750 --> 03:23:02,290
Hold on.

5546
03:23:02,290 --> 03:23:02,830
Oh, okay.

5547
03:23:03,750 --> 03:23:04,190
Hello?

5548
03:23:04,650 --> 03:23:04,870
Hello?

5549
03:23:06,750 --> 03:23:07,050
Hello?

5550
03:23:08,990 --> 03:23:09,870
Uh-oh.

5551
03:23:10,070 --> 03:23:10,730
Curse game.

5552
03:23:10,970 --> 03:23:11,250
Uh-oh.

5553
03:23:11,430 --> 03:23:11,990
Curse game.

5554
03:23:12,130 --> 03:23:12,470
Uh-oh.

5555
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:13,570
Uh-oh.

5556
03:23:13,650 --> 03:23:14,130
What happened?

5557
03:23:16,330 --> 03:23:16,770
Barry!

5558
03:23:22,640 --> 03:23:25,540
I-I'm trying to control my controller, but...

5559
03:23:26,600 --> 03:23:27,820
You're unable to join the match.

5560
03:23:27,880 --> 03:23:29,280
Could not connect to all players?

5561
03:23:29,980 --> 03:23:30,300
Huh?

5562
03:23:30,960 --> 03:23:32,440
You're right here in front of me.

5563
03:23:32,540 --> 03:23:33,940
I know, I see you.

5564
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:35,440
You're moving around right now.

5565
03:23:35,600 --> 03:23:36,380
Yeah, I am.

5566
03:23:37,500 --> 03:23:38,040
Wait, hold on.

5567
03:23:38,140 --> 03:23:39,880
Maybe I can...

5568
03:23:39,880 --> 03:23:42,540
How do I...

5569
03:23:44,180 --> 03:23:44,640
Uh...

5570
03:23:46,240 --> 03:23:46,700
What?

5571
03:23:47,540 --> 03:23:49,280
Why doesn't my controller work?

5572
03:23:49,760 --> 03:23:50,980
Let me re-plug.

5573
03:23:51,720 --> 03:23:52,060
Yeah.

5574
03:23:52,480 --> 03:23:55,140
Mint, I think you'll have to finish it without me.

5575
03:23:55,240 --> 03:23:55,840
I can't!

5576
03:23:55,880 --> 03:23:56,900
I literally cannot!

5577
03:23:59,580 --> 03:24:00,940
You have to believe.

5578
03:24:01,260 --> 03:24:02,520
If you believe, you can finish it.

5579
03:24:02,540 --> 03:24:23,680

03:24:40,060 --> 03:24:40,860
Yeah, it's...

5585
03:24:40,860 --> 03:24:44,040
I'm trying to use my keyboard and it's not even letting me play on my keyboard.

5586
03:24:48,860 --> 03:24:49,260
Wait.

5587
03:24:50,780 --> 03:24:51,480
We're done.

5588
03:24:52,040 --> 03:24:52,400
No!

5589
03:24:53,620 --> 03:24:54,380
Wait, what?

5590
03:24:54,500 --> 03:24:55,220
Don't die on me.

5591
03:24:55,320 --> 03:24:55,980
Oh, where'd you go?

5592
03:24:56,420 --> 03:24:56,520

5593
03:24:56,520 --> 03:24:57,880
Oh, I think you're gone now!

5594
03:24:58,740 --> 03:24:59,280
No, wait.

5595
03:24:59,320 --> 03:25:00,100
Okay, I'm...

5596
03:25:00,100 --> 03:25:00,120
No, I'm going to respawn.

5597
03:25:01,400 --> 03:25:03,040
I, I, okay, let me come back.

5598
03:25:04,180 --> 03:25:04,560

5599
03:25:04,780 --> 03:25:05,080
I'm coming.

5600
03:25:05,560 --> 03:25:05,840
I'm coming.

5601
03:25:05,940 --> 03:25:07,160
You need me to send you an invite?

5602
03:25:07,320 --> 03:25:08,520
Oh, all players have left again.

5603
03:25:08,520 --> 03:25:09,600
No, I just joined off of you.

5604
03:25:09,940 --> 03:25:10,080
Huh?

5605
03:25:10,380 --> 03:25:11,520
Oh my god.

5606
03:25:12,340 --> 03:25:12,500
What?

5607
03:25:12,720 --> 03:25:13,120
Uh-oh.

5608
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:14,620
Yeah, you're gone.

5609
03:25:14,820 --> 03:25:15,360
You're gone.

5610
03:25:16,040 --> 03:25:16,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5611
03:25:16,820 --> 03:25:17,140
I'm coming.

5612
03:25:17,220 --> 03:25:17,440
I'm coming.

5613
03:25:17,540 --> 03:25:18,480
I'm coming back online.

5614
03:25:19,260 --> 03:25:20,120
No, you're gone.

5615
03:25:20,300 --> 03:25:20,840
You're gone.

5616
03:25:21,680 --> 03:25:24,120
It says I can't complete.

5617
03:25:26,660 --> 03:25:28,880
Why is my controller just not working?

5618
03:25:31,420 --> 03:25:33,240
I do this every time.

5619
03:25:34,060 --> 03:25:34,860
Okay, I quit the game.

5620
03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:37,080
Let me send you an invite.

5621
03:25:38,340 --> 03:25:38,740
Oh, wait.

5622
03:25:38,840 --> 03:25:40,880
No, my controller's not working anymore now.

5623
03:25:41,400 --> 03:25:42,240
What the heck?

5624
03:25:42,260 --> 03:25:43,880
Hold on, I gotta use my other controller.

5625
03:25:44,120 --> 03:25:44,800
Oh, my God.

5626
03:25:45,200 --> 03:25:45,940
Oh, no.

5627
03:25:47,060 --> 03:25:47,820
Oh, no.

5628
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:48,500
Please hold.

5629
03:25:48,500 --> 03:25:50,000
We're so close to the end.

5630
03:25:50,560 --> 03:25:51,100
I know.

5631
03:25:51,480 --> 03:25:53,280
It's not because of the Wi-Fi, you guys.

5632
03:25:53,500 --> 03:25:53,680
Okay.

5633
03:25:54,320 --> 03:25:55,060
Oh, wait.

5634
03:25:55,480 --> 03:25:55,980
Okay, good.

5635
03:25:56,140 --> 03:25:58,280
My spy controller stopped working for a second.

5636
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:00,580

5640
03:27:40,860 --> 03:27:42,860
I thought I was getting Thai food.

5641
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:46,060
Oh, that's right.

5642
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:48,280
Why are you saying it with an accent?

5643
03:27:50,640 --> 03:27:52,140
Because you don't like my accent?

5644
03:27:53,220 --> 03:27:55,200
I want to hear your best British accent.

5645
03:27:56,160 --> 03:27:57,120
All right, what should I say?

5646
03:27:58,180 --> 03:28:00,520
Say, do you want T.F.

5647
03:28:00,680 --> 03:28:01,720
Crumpets in the morning?

5648
03:28:02,860 --> 03:28:05,120
Do you want Tay and Crump?

5649
03:28:05,300 --> 03:28:06,540
It's in the morning.

5650
03:28:07,520 --> 03:28:14,880
Do you want Tay and Crump?

5651
03:28:15,500 --> 03:28:15,700
Crump.

5652
03:28:16,080 --> 03:28:16,720
Crump.

5653
03:28:18,720 --> 03:28:23,920
Every accent I try to do always turns into something southern.

5654
03:28:24,260 --> 03:28:24,680
I know.

5655
03:28:24,900 --> 03:28:25,740
I noticed that.

5656
03:28:27,020 --> 03:28:28,680
Every, every.

5657
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:30,440
Every.

5658
03:28:31,120 --> 03:28:31,140
Every.

5659
03:28:32,800 --> 03:28:35,660
T-T-T-T and cramp.

5660
03:28:36,080 --> 03:28:38,420
You just gotta play it up like stupid, you know?

5661
03:28:38,500 --> 03:28:39,580
Oh, I did it again.

5662
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:41,960
Oops, I did it again.

5663
03:28:42,240 --> 03:28:44,900
Oops, I did it again.

5664
03:28:45,180 --> 03:28:46,860
Oh my god, they launched me.

5665
03:28:47,740 --> 03:28:49,140
Wait, how did you do this before?

5666
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:52,340
Just the second from the top, I think, maybe?

5667
03:28:52,700 --> 03:28:53,640
Or maybe not even that.

5668
03:28:53,680 --> 03:28:54,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that.

5669
03:28:54,660 --> 03:28:55,500
And then I just...

5670
03:28:57,440 --> 03:28:59,020
Oh, just don't get caught.

5671
03:28:59,160 --> 03:28:59,380
All right.

5672
03:28:59,840 --> 03:29:00,860
Yeah, don't get caught.

5673
03:29:01,720 --> 03:29:03,080
I love...

5674
03:29:03,080 --> 03:29:04,860
I love...

5675
03:29:04,860 --> 03:29:05,640
I love...

5676
03:29:05,640 --> 03:29:06,160
I...

5677
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:08,700
What are you trying to say?

5678
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:09,960
I love...

5679
03:29:09,960 --> 03:29:11,500
I love Doctor Who.

5680
03:29:12,020 --> 03:29:13,720
Oh, I love...

5681
03:29:15,320 --> 03:29:15,980
I love...

5682
03:29:16,820 --> 03:29:17,500
I love...

5683
03:29:17,500 --> 03:29:20,140
I love me...

5684
03:29:20,140 --> 03:29:21,840
I love Doctor Who.

5685
03:29:24,620 --> 03:29:25,820
I can't...

5686
03:29:25,820 --> 03:29:27,260
I can't listen to this anymore.

5687
03:29:28,380 --> 03:29:30,280
I'm taking on my damn headphones.

5688
03:29:33,340 --> 03:29:35,540
Oh god, we have to do this nightmare again.

5689
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:37,060
I know, it's okay though, we know now.

5690
03:29:37,220 --> 03:29:37,940
Why doesn't he...

5691
03:29:37,940 --> 03:29:38,540
Wait, you got...

5692
03:29:38,540 --> 03:29:39,700
Can we help me do this first?

5693
03:29:40,420 --> 03:29:41,160
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

5694
03:29:47,910 --> 03:29:49,050
Oh, come back!

5695
03:29:49,210 --> 03:29:50,050

Oh my...

5700
03:29:55,810 --> 03:29:59,590
It's like so much easier once you understand what it wants from you.

5701
03:29:59,870 --> 03:30:00,470
This asshole...

5702
03:30:00,470 --> 03:30:00,910
Okay, whatever.

03:30:01,650 --> 03:30:02,130
For real.

5704
03:30:02,330 --> 03:30:02,990
I'm over it.

5705
03:30:03,290 --> 03:30:04,830

5716
03:30:18,210 --> 03:30:19,810

5717
03:30:20,590 --> 03:30:21,210
Okay, we're good, we're good.

5718
03:30:23,330 --> 03:30:23,690
Nice.

5719
03:30:24,950 --> 03:30:25,770
And now what?

5720
03:30:25,970 --> 03:30:27,270
Oh, wait, I stopped here.

5721
03:30:27,290 --> 03:30:27,890
You jump, you jump.

5722
03:30:28,310 --> 03:30:29,530
I'm jumping, I'm jumping.

5723
03:30:30,130 --> 03:30:30,750
Oh, you got it.

5724
03:30:30,770 --> 03:30:31,310
I set it off.

5725
03:30:32,030 --> 03:30:32,770
What does that do?

5726
03:30:33,590 --> 03:30:34,250
There's a boulder.

5727
03:30:36,070 --> 03:30:37,470
Now I think we can teleport.

5728
03:30:37,610 --> 03:30:38,190
Yeah, yeah.

5729
03:30:38,270 --> 03:30:40,570
Oh, the boulder was blocking.

5730
03:30:40,650 --> 03:30:40,750
Oh.

5731
03:30:41,470 --> 03:30:43,150
The boulder was blocking it.

5732
03:30:45,170 --> 03:30:46,590
He's unleashing frogs!

5733
03:30:48,070 --> 03:30:50,270
Oh, yeah, I guess that's all of it.

5734
03:30:50,390 --> 03:30:50,590
Oops.

5735
03:30:53,990 --> 03:30:54,790
You got it?

03:30:54,810 --> 03:30:55,050
Nice.

03:31:07,870 --> 03:31:08,170
Oh, God.

5749
03:31:09,510 --> 03:31:10,330
Wait, we need the ball.

5750
03:31:10,510 --> 03:31:11,550
We need the ball of yarn.

5751
03:31:12,730 --> 03:31:13,330

Oh, if I wall jumped, I would be able to.

03:34:57,290 --> 03:34:59,710
Ah, wait, let me change my weapon back.

5884
03:35:00,370 --> 03:35:01,670
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

5885
03:35:02,690 --> 03:35:03,290
I'm fine.

5886
03:35:04,990 --> 03:35:05,670
Okay, there you go.

5887
03:35:06,110 --> 03:35:06,430
Oops.

5888
03:35:09,570 --> 03:35:11,010
Whoa, my god.

5889
03:35:11,150 --> 03:35:12,190
Get this guy out of here, man.

5890
03:35:12,330 --> 03:35:13,590
Get this guy out of here.

5891
03:35:14,030 --> 03:35:14,430
I don't know.

5892
03:35:18,050 --> 03:35:18,410
Okay.

5893
03:35:19,250 --> 03:35:20,610
Oh, oh, there's the emerald.

5894
03:35:20,930 --> 03:35:21,590
Yeah, I got it.

5895
03:35:22,250 --> 03:35:22,970
Okay, you got it.

5896
03:35:23,150 --> 03:35:23,950
All right, nice.

5897
03:35:26,570 --> 03:35:28,250
Are there any secrets though?

5898
03:35:28,350 --> 03:35:29,190
We'll never know.

5899
03:35:29,810 --> 03:35:30,170
Oops.

5900
03:35:30,550 --> 03:35:30,990
What happened?

5901
03:35:31,630 --> 03:35:32,610
I don't know.

5902
03:35:34,590 --> 03:35:35,310
They just...

5903
03:35:35,310 --> 03:35:36,090
Wait, what did I do?

5904
03:35:36,330 --> 03:35:36,650
The button...

5905
03:35:36,650 --> 03:35:37,250
Oh, it's on the button.

5906
03:35:37,270 --> 03:35:38,130
I don't know.

5907
03:35:38,270 --> 03:35:38,870
Oh my god.

5908
03:35:39,390 --> 03:35:39,610
Oops.

5909
03:35:40,770 --> 03:35:40,870
Ah!

5910
03:35:41,910 --> 03:35:42,350
Okay.

5911
03:35:43,210 --> 03:35:43,430
Be careful.

5912
03:35:44,630 --> 03:35:44,930
Okay.

5913
03:35:46,650 --> 03:35:47,310
All right.

5914
03:35:47,470 --> 03:35:47,910
Okay.

5915
03:35:48,770 --> 03:35:48,950
Okay.

5916
03:35:51,410 --> 03:35:51,510
Okay.

5917
03:35:52,030 --> 03:35:52,350
Okay.

5918
03:35:52,350 --> 03:35:52,370
Okay.

5919
03:35:53,330 --> 03:35:53,770
Okay.

5920
03:35:53,890 --> 03:35:54,050
Okay.

5921
03:35:54,330 --> 03:35:54,430
Okay.

5922
03:35:55,510 --> 03:35:55,950
Nice.

5923
03:35:56,170 --> 03:35:56,490
Nice.

5924
03:35:56,490 --> 03:35:56,790
Nice.

5925
03:35:59,850 --> 03:36:00,810
Oh my god.

5926
03:36:01,370 --> 03:36:02,270
Oh, we got it.

5927
03:36:02,270 --> 03:36:02,650
We got it.

5928
03:36:02,810 --> 03:36:03,390
We got it though.

5929
03:36:03,490 --> 03:36:04,150
We got it though.

5930
03:36:05,450 --> 03:36:06,130
Okay, nice.

5931
03:36:07,270 --> 03:36:07,590
Nice!

5932
03:36:09,310 --> 03:36:11,610
Died in the process, but it's all part of the plan.

5933
03:36:11,810 --> 03:36:12,370
It's okay, it's okay.

5934
03:36:12,510 --> 03:36:13,070
It's all worth it.

5935
03:36:13,150 --> 03:36:13,910
It's all worth it.

5936
03:36:14,230 --> 03:36:14,450
Yeah.

5937
03:36:14,770 --> 03:36:14,790
Okay.

5938
03:36:14,790 --> 03:36:14,870
Oops.

5939
03:36:16,050 --> 03:36:16,370
Okay.

5940
03:36:16,610 --> 03:36:17,770
I think, I think we got...

5941
03:36:18,950 --> 03:36:19,390
Oh.

5942
03:36:20,070 --> 03:36:20,510
Oh.

5943
03:36:20,670 --> 03:36:21,150
Just go!

5944
03:36:21,270 --> 03:36:21,710
Just go!

5945
03:36:22,030 --> 03:36:23,370
Okay, let's go!

5946
03:36:23,370 --> 03:36:23,750
Let's go!

5947
03:36:24,050 --> 03:36:24,670
Do we miss anything?

5948
03:36:25,210 --> 03:36:25,750
Is that it?

5949
03:36:26,170 --> 03:36:26,410
Four?

5950
03:36:26,670 --> 03:36:28,450
I think we missed some stuff.

5951
03:36:28,970 --> 03:36:30,150
I think we might have missed.

5952
03:36:30,250 --> 03:36:31,190
I don't... I didn't... Oh.

5953
03:36:32,310 --> 03:36:32,910
Oh, wow.

5954
03:36:32,930 --> 03:36:33,630
We missed two.

5955
03:36:33,730 --> 03:36:34,030
Two.

5956
03:36:34,810 --> 03:36:35,650
That's fun.

5957
03:36:36,550 --> 03:36:37,210
That's fun.

5958
03:36:37,270 --> 03:36:39,270
We're fine.

5959
03:36:40,510 --> 03:36:42,150
B for Bantone.

5960
03:36:42,650 --> 03:36:45,050
Shame on Harry Hattigton.

5961
03:36:45,270 --> 03:36:46,730
Shame on you!

5962
03:36:46,730 --> 03:36:46,730
Shame!

5963
03:36:47,530 --> 03:36:47,530
Shame!

5964
03:36:47,970 --> 03:36:48,430
Shame!

5965
03:36:49,830 --> 03:36:51,150
All right.

5966
03:36:52,530 --> 03:36:54,570
Oh my, oh, they're booing him.

5967
03:36:55,290 --> 03:36:55,570
Wow.

5968
03:36:55,670 --> 03:36:56,090
Are they?

5969
03:36:56,910 --> 03:36:58,270
Yeah, yeah, they're booing him.

5970
03:36:58,630 --> 03:37:02,470
You cannot walk, for this is a race against the clock.

5971
03:37:02,830 --> 03:37:03,150
Okay.

5972
03:37:03,790 --> 03:37:04,050
Oh.

5973
03:37:04,510 --> 03:37:05,210
Okay, here we go.

5974
03:37:05,290 --> 03:37:05,750
Good start.

5975
03:37:08,330 --> 03:37:09,010
Oh god.

5976
03:37:09,570 --> 03:37:10,150
Oh my god.

5977
03:37:10,470 --> 03:37:11,090
Oh my god.

5978
03:37:11,110 --> 03:37:11,970
Oh my god.

5979
03:37:12,090 --> 03:37:12,570
Oh my god.

5980
03:37:13,010 --> 03:37:15,630
When the screen gets so small, it's so hard to tell.

5981
03:37:16,290 --> 03:37:16,430
Oh.

5982
03:37:16,650 --> 03:37:16,930
Ah!

5983
03:37:17,450 --> 03:37:17,970
It's okay.

5984
03:37:18,330 --> 03:37:19,350
Or it's okay for me.

5985
03:37:19,530 --> 03:37:19,790
Yeah.

5986
03:37:20,590 --> 03:37:21,530
Well, you made it.

5987
03:37:21,570 --> 03:37:21,890
It's cool.

5988
03:37:23,370 --> 03:37:23,990
It's okay.

5989
03:37:24,090 --> 03:37:24,830
I don't want to live anywhere.

5990
03:37:25,070 --> 03:37:25,110
Ouch.

5991
03:37:25,150 --> 03:37:25,330
Ouch.

5992
03:37:25,970 --> 03:37:25,970
Ouch.

5993
03:37:27,150 --> 03:37:27,530
Ouch.

5994
03:37:28,890 --> 03:37:29,510
Hold on.

5995
03:37:29,530 --> 03:37:30,330
Let me use your head.

5996
03:37:30,710 --> 03:37:31,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5997
03:37:31,150 --> 03:37:32,030
Use my head.

5998
03:37:32,730 --> 03:37:33,170
Use my noggin.

5999
03:37:33,490 --> 03:37:34,310
Oh, it will.

6000
03:37:34,530 --> 03:37:34,990
Oh, there we go.

6001
03:37:35,230 --> 03:37:35,330
Okay.

6002
03:37:35,330 --> 03:37:35,970
There we go.

6003
03:37:36,070 --> 03:37:36,330
There you go.

6004
03:37:37,310 --> 03:37:37,710
what?

6005
03:37:38,490 --> 03:37:40,530
Why can't I okay?

6006
03:37:40,550 --> 03:37:40,950
Okay.

6007
03:37:43,010 --> 03:37:43,010
Okay.

6008
03:37:43,230 --> 03:37:43,330
Hello.

6009
03:37:43,810 --> 03:37:44,030
Hello.

6010
03:37:44,270 --> 03:37:44,410
Okay.

6011
03:37:45,110 --> 03:37:45,710
Oh, there we go.

6012
03:37:46,150 --> 03:37:46,150
Nice.

6013
03:37:46,310 --> 03:37:46,530
Nice.

6014
03:37:47,190 --> 03:37:47,590
Nice?

6015
03:37:48,530 --> 03:37:48,930
Okay.

6016
03:37:49,530 --> 03:37:49,670
Nice.

6017
03:37:50,390 --> 03:37:51,490
You're so good at this game.

6018
03:37:51,590 --> 03:37:52,470
You're so good at this game.

6019
03:37:52,550 --> 03:37:53,150
Ditto gaming?

6020
03:37:53,650 --> 03:37:55,170
I can't see anything anymore.

6021
03:37:56,270 --> 03:37:56,670
Okay.

6022
03:37:57,750 --> 03:37:58,850
Oh, you got something up there?

6023
03:37:59,170 --> 03:38:00,710
Oh, why am I all the way back here?

6024
03:38:01,210 --> 03:38:01,810
Oh my gosh.

6025
03:38:01,830 --> 03:38:02,270
Oh my goodness.

6026
03:38:02,650 --> 03:38:03,050
Yeah, just...

6027
03:38:03,050 --> 03:38:03,290
Okay.

6028
03:38:03,490 --> 03:38:03,950
Alright, we're good.

6029
03:38:04,550 --> 03:38:04,750
Oh.

6030
03:38:04,990 --> 03:38:05,450
Oh my goodness.

6031
03:38:05,610 --> 03:38:06,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

6032
03:38:06,290 --> 03:38:06,510
Why?

6033
03:38:06,870 --> 03:38:06,870
Why?

6034
03:38:06,910 --> 03:38:07,110
Why?

6035
03:38:07,270 --> 03:38:09,310
What are these weird spawns?

6036
03:38:09,410 --> 03:38:12,990
It's because of that guy blowing us up.

6037
03:38:13,330 --> 03:38:13,870
Okay, here we go.

6038
03:38:13,950 --> 03:38:14,310
Yeah, okay.

6039
03:38:14,990 --> 03:38:15,490
Oh my god.

6040
03:38:17,090 --> 03:38:18,450
How did you actually get past him?

6041
03:38:18,610 --> 03:38:19,550
Oh, there we go.

6042
03:38:19,730 --> 03:38:20,210
That works.

6043
03:38:20,230 --> 03:38:20,630
Wait, hold on.

6044
03:38:20,690 --> 03:38:22,150
Can you push me up there?

6045
03:38:24,370 --> 03:38:24,750
Or...

6046
03:38:24,750 --> 03:38:26,270
Wait, uh...

6047
03:38:26,270 --> 03:38:26,990
Oh my god.

6048
03:38:27,450 --> 03:38:27,750
No!

6049
03:38:27,930 --> 03:38:28,330
Oh, there we go.

6050
03:38:29,210 --> 03:38:29,950
Wait, hold on.

6051
03:38:30,050 --> 03:38:30,610
Wait, wait, wait.

6052
03:38:30,670 --> 03:38:30,850
Hold on.

6053
03:38:30,850 --> 03:38:31,470
Oh my god!

6054
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:32,310
Ah, bitch!

6055
03:38:33,170 --> 03:38:34,610
I hate this guy, man.

6056
03:38:35,070 --> 03:38:36,130
I know, they're so annoying.

6057
03:38:36,630 --> 03:38:36,930
Okay.

6058
03:38:36,930 --> 03:38:38,090
Can you jump?

6059
03:38:38,510 --> 03:38:38,810
Oh, wait.

6060
03:38:39,130 --> 03:38:40,030
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6061
03:38:40,170 --> 03:38:40,490
Over here.

6062
03:38:40,530 --> 03:38:41,150
Oh, here, I'll kill him.

6063
03:38:41,990 --> 03:38:42,150
Okay.

6064
03:38:42,470 --> 03:38:43,770
Can you come over here?

6065
03:38:44,090 --> 03:38:44,310
Yeah.

6066
03:38:45,050 --> 03:38:45,150
Okay.

6067
03:38:45,150 --> 03:38:46,030
Yeah, okay.

6068
03:38:46,470 --> 03:38:47,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

6069
03:38:48,250 --> 03:38:49,630
Just bounce, bounce, bounce.

6070
03:38:49,950 --> 03:38:50,330
There we go.

6071
03:38:50,550 --> 03:38:50,690
Yeah!

6072
03:38:51,170 --> 03:38:52,110
Okay, okay, we're good.

6073
03:38:53,610 --> 03:38:54,050
Oh, what do we need?

6074
03:38:54,050 --> 03:38:54,530
Get in the paper boat.

6075
03:38:56,650 --> 03:38:57,050
Maybe?

6076
03:38:57,450 --> 03:38:57,710
What?

6077
03:38:57,890 --> 03:38:58,190
Oh, yeah.

6078
03:38:58,410 --> 03:38:58,630
Maybe?

6079
03:38:58,950 --> 03:39:00,230
Oh, you have to use it.

6080
03:39:00,270 --> 03:39:00,590
Uh-oh.

6081
03:39:01,210 --> 03:39:01,610
Wait.

6082
03:39:01,870 --> 03:39:02,050
What?

6083
03:39:03,110 --> 03:39:05,730
You have to use it to get into the teleporter.

6084
03:39:06,510 --> 03:39:06,910
Okay.

6085
03:39:06,930 --> 03:39:08,470
Oh, wait, wait, wait, we're about to run out of time.

6086
03:39:08,570 --> 03:39:09,430
We're about to run out of time.

6087
03:39:09,490 --> 03:39:09,770
Oh, uh-uh.

6088
03:39:09,850 --> 03:39:10,710
Okay, hold on.

6089
03:39:13,590 --> 03:39:14,670
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

6090
03:39:15,870 --> 03:39:16,270
Okay.

6091
03:39:16,850 --> 03:39:18,010
Now jump into a...

6092
03:39:18,010 --> 03:39:18,590
Yeah, there we go.

6093
03:39:18,810 --> 03:39:19,270
Oh, nice!

6094
03:39:19,450 --> 03:39:20,670
Wait, no, that just...

6095
03:39:20,670 --> 03:39:21,250
What?

6096
03:39:22,050 --> 03:39:22,630
Oh, my God!

6097
03:39:22,650 --> 03:39:23,270
That is nothing!

6098
03:39:23,570 --> 03:39:24,350
It's so misleading!

6099
03:39:24,710 --> 03:39:25,030
What?

6100
03:39:25,450 --> 03:39:27,250
The boat was for the yarn?

6101
03:39:27,550 --> 03:39:29,210
Oh, what the heck?

6102
03:39:29,330 --> 03:39:31,870
I guess that makes a little bit of sense, maybe.

6103
03:39:33,850 --> 03:39:34,710
Oh, oopsie.

6104
03:39:36,030 --> 03:39:36,830
Yeah, that's...

6105
03:39:36,930 --> 03:39:37,790
That's weird.

6106
03:39:39,450 --> 03:39:41,430
Jump on my head and then jump from there maybe?

6107
03:39:42,110 --> 03:39:42,130
Yep.

6108
03:39:42,270 --> 03:39:42,870
There you go.

6109
03:39:43,790 --> 03:39:44,350
Okay, nice.

6110
03:39:46,610 --> 03:39:47,370
Oh, you got it?

6111
03:39:47,450 --> 03:39:47,590
Nice.

6112
03:39:48,090 --> 03:39:48,810
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

6113
03:39:49,910 --> 03:39:51,010
Just keep going, just keep going.

6114
03:39:55,030 --> 03:39:56,190
Uh, oh, thank you.

6115
03:39:56,530 --> 03:39:57,030
Okay, there we go.

6116
03:39:57,870 --> 03:39:58,190
Nice.

6117
03:40:01,210 --> 03:40:01,530
Okay.

6118
03:40:01,770 --> 03:40:02,250
Oh, ouch.

6119
03:40:02,550 --> 03:40:03,150
But it's okay.

6120
03:40:03,330 --> 03:40:03,690
We're cool.

6121
03:40:03,690 --> 03:40:04,050
You got it.

6122
03:40:04,050 --> 03:40:04,330
You got it.

6123
03:40:04,430 --> 03:40:04,970
We got it.

6124
03:40:05,110 --> 03:40:05,150
Yeah.

6125
03:40:05,930 --> 03:40:06,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6126
03:40:06,970 --> 03:40:07,410
I can't.

6127
03:40:07,450 --> 03:40:08,070
Tiny screen.

6128
03:40:08,350 --> 03:40:08,470
Tiny screen.

6129
03:40:08,490 --> 03:40:09,050
Green, okay.

6130
03:40:11,890 --> 03:40:13,070
Oh, oops, not bad.

6131
03:40:14,470 --> 03:40:14,870
Okay.

6132
03:40:15,530 --> 03:40:15,930
I'm gonna...

6133
03:40:15,930 --> 03:40:16,550
Oh, damn it.

6134
03:40:16,770 --> 03:40:18,270
Okay, move the boat to the bottom.

6135
03:40:22,620 --> 03:40:23,520
I'll wait if I could.

6136
03:40:24,500 --> 03:40:25,400
I'll handle him.

6137
03:40:25,520 --> 03:40:25,780
Okay, okay.

6138
03:40:26,400 --> 03:40:26,940
Okay, go.

6139
03:40:26,940 --> 03:40:27,680
I thought I would.

6140
03:40:27,960 --> 03:40:28,680
Well, um...

6141
03:40:28,680 --> 03:40:29,280
Okay, it's okay.

6142
03:40:29,920 --> 03:40:30,440
Just get the...

6143
03:40:30,440 --> 03:40:30,980
Go get the yarn.

6144
03:40:31,040 --> 03:40:31,540
Go get the yarn!

6145
03:40:32,420 --> 03:40:33,080
Oh, what?

6146
03:40:33,220 --> 03:40:33,940
Oh, my God.

6147
03:40:34,240 --> 03:40:34,880
Did you get it?

6148
03:40:35,460 --> 03:40:35,860
No.

6149
03:40:36,200 --> 03:40:36,360
Oh.

6150
03:40:36,660 --> 03:40:37,060
Ah.

6151
03:40:40,740 --> 03:40:41,180
Okay.

6152
03:40:42,080 --> 03:40:42,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

6153
03:40:43,800 --> 03:40:44,500
I got it.

6154
03:40:44,680 --> 03:40:45,180
Oh, nice.

6155
03:40:45,300 --> 03:40:45,740
Okay, nice.

6156
03:40:46,720 --> 03:40:47,780
And I exploded.

6157
03:40:48,220 --> 03:40:48,380
Okay.

6158
03:40:48,620 --> 03:40:49,700
And then we just go down here.

6159
03:40:49,840 --> 03:40:50,020
Yep.

6160
03:40:50,240 --> 03:40:51,720
And then...

6161
03:40:52,300 --> 03:40:53,560
Uh, we go here.

6162
03:40:53,920 --> 03:40:54,000
Oh!

6163
03:40:57,140 --> 03:40:57,360
Ow!

6164
03:40:59,000 --> 03:41:00,720
Wait, how the heck are we supposed to do this fire?

6165
03:41:01,020 --> 03:41:02,440
Oh, because of the...

6166
03:41:02,440 --> 03:41:03,740
Oh, I guess...

6167
03:41:03,740 --> 03:41:04,840
Oh, that's a weird time.

6168
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:05,240
Yeah.

6169
03:41:05,560 --> 03:41:05,980
It's weird timing.

6170
03:41:07,120 --> 03:41:07,940
Oh, my God.

6171
03:41:09,380 --> 03:41:09,820
Oh.

6172
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:12,920
Oh my gosh, okay.

6173
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:15,340
It's like just barely enough time to push you down.

6174
03:41:17,060 --> 03:41:17,580
What?

6175
03:41:18,780 --> 03:41:20,380
You have to like swoop under it.

6176
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:22,380
Yeah, that feels so exact.

6177
03:41:22,680 --> 03:41:22,960
Yeah.

6178
03:41:23,980 --> 03:41:24,460
Uh-oh.

6179
03:41:24,840 --> 03:41:25,500
Good timing.

6180
03:41:25,700 --> 03:41:26,160
Oh my goodness.

6181
03:41:27,240 --> 03:41:28,160
Oh my god.

6182
03:41:29,480 --> 03:41:30,000
Ah!

6183
03:41:31,180 --> 03:41:31,520
Ah!

6184
03:41:32,060 --> 03:41:32,400
Ah!

6185
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:33,900
This is gonna be...

6186
03:41:33,900 --> 03:41:35,280
That can't be it, is it?

6187
03:41:36,760 --> 03:41:38,280
That can't be it, is it?

6188
03:41:39,900 --> 03:41:40,420
Oh!

6189
03:41:40,720 --> 03:41:42,000
You're supposed to use...

6190
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:42,060
Oh!

6191
03:41:42,680 --> 03:41:43,200
Yeah, okay, okay.

6192
03:41:43,220 --> 03:41:43,660
That makes sense.

6193
03:41:43,780 --> 03:41:44,420
That makes sense.

6194
03:41:44,480 --> 03:41:45,680
The timing?

6195
03:41:46,040 --> 03:41:47,000
We both did it?

6196
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:47,320
Okay.

6197
03:41:47,900 --> 03:41:48,940
Oh my god.

6198
03:41:49,160 --> 03:41:51,240
At least we know what we know now.

6199
03:41:51,400 --> 03:41:51,900
We know now.

6200
03:41:52,360 --> 03:41:52,860
Oh my god.

6201
03:41:53,160 --> 03:41:57,060
I feel like the last few levels like jumped in difficulty so much.

6202
03:41:57,080 --> 03:41:57,800
I know, like crazy.

6203
03:41:58,660 --> 03:41:58,920
Oh, sorry.

6204
03:41:58,920 --> 03:41:59,680
Yeah, what the heck?

6205
03:42:01,300 --> 03:42:03,140
Okay, good job, good job.

6206
03:42:05,520 --> 03:42:07,240
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

6207
03:42:11,250 --> 03:42:11,550
Nice.

6208
03:42:11,710 --> 03:42:12,550
Oh, not nice.

6209
03:42:12,850 --> 03:42:13,270
That's okay.

6210
03:42:16,330 --> 03:42:17,290
You got it?

6211
03:42:17,370 --> 03:42:17,370

Yep, yep, yep.

We're freaking gaming.

6216
03:42:23,110 --> 03:42:24,050
We're gaming, yeah.

6217
03:42:24,370 --> 03:42:24,370
Gaming?

6218
03:42:26,230 --> 03:42:26,910
Okay, nice.

6258
03:45:49,580 --> 03:45:50,760
How do we...

6259
03:45:50,760 --> 03:45:52,420
I mean, we can't go back up.

6260
03:45:52,680 --> 03:45:53,620
Oh, oh, the boulder.

6261
03:45:54,720 --> 03:45:55,960
What does the boulder do, though?

6262
03:45:56,400 --> 03:45:56,980
For what?

6263
03:45:58,160 --> 03:45:59,360
There's a thing at the end.

6264
03:45:59,460 --> 03:46:00,340
There's a thing at the end.

6265
03:46:01,200 --> 03:46:02,600
There's a cloud at the end.

6266
03:46:03,060 --> 03:46:04,880
Oh, oh, that's right, that's right, the cloud!

6267
03:46:05,160 --> 03:46:06,640
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

6268
03:46:07,160 --> 03:46:08,020
Don't go underneath.

6269
03:46:08,800 --> 03:46:09,920
Here, I'll just send this in too.

6270
03:46:11,460 --> 03:46:13,040
Oh my, oh my, oh my god.

6271
03:46:13,500 --> 03:46:13,860
Ow!

6272
03:46:14,580 --> 03:46:16,160
Oh my god, oh my god.

6273
03:46:16,560 --> 03:46:17,540
This is a nightmare!

6274
03:46:17,780 --> 03:46:17,980
What?

6275
03:46:20,480 --> 03:46:21,440
What is this?

6276
03:46:21,760 --> 03:46:23,020
Oh my gosh.

6277
03:46:23,480 --> 03:46:24,080
Oops, oops.

6278
03:46:24,200 --> 03:46:25,020
Oh my god.

6279
03:46:28,880 --> 03:46:29,800
What the heck?

6280
03:46:30,960 --> 03:46:31,700
You sucker.

6281
03:46:37,930 --> 03:46:40,230
Oh, I see what you meant about the...

6282
03:46:40,230 --> 03:46:40,330
Oops.

6283
03:46:41,050 --> 03:46:41,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6284
03:46:42,250 --> 03:46:43,250
Did you grab that or no?

6285
03:46:43,870 --> 03:46:44,330
Oh, my gosh.

6286
03:46:44,510 --> 03:46:44,910
I did, I did.

6287
03:46:48,570 --> 03:46:48,930
Okay.

6288
03:46:50,930 --> 03:46:52,250
Idiot, you hit yourself.

6289
03:46:52,810 --> 03:46:52,970
Yeah.

6290
03:46:53,490 --> 03:46:56,170
Oh, please, please, please, please.

6291
03:46:56,450 --> 03:46:58,630
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

6292
03:46:59,450 --> 03:46:59,690
Okay.

6293
03:47:01,130 --> 03:47:03,150
Ah, I was trapped in a loop!

6294
03:47:03,770 --> 03:47:04,090
Ah!

6295
03:47:06,490 --> 03:47:07,290
Who is?!

6296
03:47:08,010 --> 03:47:09,250
Okay, we're fine.

6297
03:47:09,710 --> 03:47:10,030
Okay, I'll go.

6298
03:47:10,230 --> 03:47:11,950
How do we do it this time?

6299
03:47:12,110 --> 03:47:14,350
Because that doesn't make anything disappear.

6300
03:47:15,050 --> 03:47:16,270
I guess it's just the boulder.

6301
03:47:16,710 --> 03:47:17,870
Yeah, we just gotta do the boulder.

6302
03:47:18,510 --> 03:47:23,750
Like, use it to, like, stand, you know, like, like this.

6303
03:47:24,230 --> 03:47:24,530
Yeah.

6304
03:47:25,650 --> 03:47:26,690
Oops, my bad.

6305
03:47:26,890 --> 03:47:27,110
Oh god.

6306
03:47:27,590 --> 03:47:29,010
Uh-oh, now we have to grab him again.

6307
03:47:29,230 --> 03:47:29,430
Okay.

6308
03:47:30,690 --> 03:47:31,090
Okay.

6309
03:47:31,670 --> 03:47:32,050
Wait!

6310
03:47:32,410 --> 03:47:34,570
You could get the, what's it called if you want?

6311
03:47:35,450 --> 03:48:09,040

03:48:09,160 --> 03:48:09,440
Barry.

6313
03:48:11,580 --> 03:48:12,740
I can't do it anymore.

6314
03:48:13,460 --> 03:48:14,780
I can't do this shit anymore.

6315
03:48:15,520 --> 03:48:16,320
I'm like, wait, what?

6316
03:48:16,420 --> 03:48:17,380
What are we supposed to do here?

6317
03:48:18,920 --> 03:48:20,620
Did you grab the yarn or no?

6318
03:48:21,200 --> 03:48:21,780
Yeah, I did, I did.

6319
03:48:22,020 --> 03:48:22,380
Oh, nice.

6320
03:48:23,340 --> 03:48:24,420
What the hell are we supposed to do?

6321
03:48:24,440 --> 03:48:26,600
I think we're supposed to, like, fall onto the...

6322
03:48:28,080 --> 03:48:30,360
onto the pink stuff, the goo.

6323
03:48:31,240 --> 03:48:33,500
Oh, the goo makes sense.

6324
03:48:36,890 --> 03:48:38,190
Wait, does it make sense?

6325
03:48:41,890 --> 03:48:43,490
Oh, we're gonna lose...

6326
03:48:46,230 --> 03:48:47,110
How the hell?

6327
03:48:48,490 --> 03:48:48,590
Oh?

6328
03:48:50,270 --> 03:48:50,990
Wait, that's crazy.

6329
03:48:51,170 --> 03:48:51,370
What?

6330
03:48:51,570 --> 03:48:52,450
What do we do there?

6331
03:48:56,240 --> 03:48:57,420
This is tough.

6332
03:48:58,580 --> 03:48:59,960
Wait, there's another one on the left side.

6333
03:49:00,140 --> 03:49:00,960
Yeah, try and grab it.

6334
03:49:01,040 --> 03:49:01,380
There you go.

6335
03:49:01,580 --> 03:49:02,860
Yeah, yeah.

6336
03:49:09,670 --> 03:49:10,070
Oh.

6337
03:49:14,590 --> 03:49:15,350
Oh, oh, oh.

6338
03:49:16,530 --> 03:49:19,380
Can I move?

6339
03:49:19,440 --> 03:49:19,780
You got it.

6340
03:49:19,780 --> 03:49:20,280
You got it.

6341
03:49:20,440 --> 03:49:21,660
I'm just going to die.

6342
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:22,940
I'm going to just die.

6343
03:49:23,200 --> 03:49:23,600
Don't die.

6344
03:49:23,820 --> 03:49:24,060
Don't die.

6345
03:49:24,160 --> 03:49:26,500
Believe in yourself.

6346
03:49:26,940 --> 03:49:27,800
Okay, I'm going.

6347
03:49:28,620 --> 03:49:28,780
Okay.

6348
03:49:29,820 --> 03:49:31,200
I don't think the button does anything.

6349
03:49:31,420 --> 03:49:31,780
Golders?

6350
03:49:31,900 --> 03:49:32,500
Oh, oops.

6351
03:49:32,560 --> 03:49:32,820
Oh, shoot.

6352
03:49:33,220 --> 03:49:34,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.

6353
03:49:35,200 --> 03:49:36,360
Okay, one at a time.

6354
03:49:37,240 --> 03:49:38,360
Okay, one at a time.

6355
03:49:39,000 --> 03:49:39,440
Here we go.

6356
03:49:41,420 --> 03:49:41,700
Oh!

6357
03:49:42,560 --> 03:49:43,340
Oh, you got it!

6358
03:49:43,360 --> 03:49:43,840
You got it!

6359
03:49:44,500 --> 03:49:45,260
Oh, my gosh.

6360
03:49:45,300 --> 03:49:46,020
I got it, I got it!

6361
03:49:46,120 --> 03:49:46,860
You got it, you got it.

6362
03:49:46,900 --> 03:49:48,160
Okay, now this is our next hurdle.

6363
03:49:48,180 --> 03:49:49,840
I do want a follow yarn, though.

6364
03:49:50,200 --> 03:49:50,560
Oh, yeah.

6365
03:49:50,620 --> 03:49:51,320
You can keep trying.

6366
03:49:51,780 --> 03:49:53,760
I'll try to figure this out or something.

6367
03:49:53,760 --> 03:49:54,120
Okay, okay.

6368
03:49:54,640 --> 03:49:55,880
Or I'll try and get the yarn.

6369
03:49:56,100 --> 03:49:57,880
You're better at wall jumping than I am.

6370
03:49:58,020 --> 03:49:59,540
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

6371
03:49:59,580 --> 03:50:00,020
I got it.

6372
03:50:00,140 --> 03:50:00,700
I got the yarn.

6373
03:50:01,560 --> 03:50:01,760
Okay.

6374
03:50:01,900 --> 03:50:02,620
Nice, instantly.

6375
03:50:02,780 --> 03:50:03,620
Okay, okay.

6376
03:50:03,700 --> 03:50:06,500
But how do you do you do this, man?

6377
03:50:07,240 --> 03:50:08,380
How do you do this?

6378
03:50:10,240 --> 03:50:11,240
I have no idea.

6379
03:50:12,380 --> 03:50:13,960
Because you can't really double jump.

6380
03:50:16,760 --> 03:50:17,160
Maybe.

6381
03:50:17,480 --> 03:50:18,360
Okay, I guess you're...

6382
03:50:19,220 --> 03:50:19,620
See,

6383
03:50:22,910 --> 03:50:25,050
there's like no place for you to like catch your...

6384
03:50:25,050 --> 03:50:26,170
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

6385
03:50:26,470 --> 03:50:26,870
Oh.

6386
03:50:34,330 --> 03:50:36,010
I'm not even going to try, guys.

6387
03:50:37,630 --> 03:50:37,970
Sorry.

6388
03:50:38,490 --> 03:50:41,390
Okay, it's okay.

6389
03:50:43,130 --> 03:50:43,510
Okay.

6390
03:50:44,230 --> 03:50:44,310
Okay, okay.

6391
03:50:44,970 --> 03:50:45,690
Okay, he's dead.

6392
03:50:45,770 --> 03:50:45,950
He's dead.

6393
03:50:46,070 --> 03:50:46,690
Go, go, Minto!

6394
03:50:47,170 --> 03:50:47,170
Go!

6395
03:50:49,550 --> 03:50:50,330
We're so close!

6396
03:50:50,510 --> 03:50:51,130
We're so close!

6397
03:50:52,050 --> 03:50:52,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

6398
03:50:53,090 --> 03:50:53,610
Okay, okay, okay.

6399
03:50:53,910 --> 03:50:54,470
Oh, wait, what?

6400
03:50:54,470 --> 03:50:55,070
Almost there, almost there, almost there.

6401
03:50:57,170 --> 03:50:57,550
Ah!

6402
03:51:00,960 --> 03:51:02,620
Oh my god!

6403
03:51:02,620 --> 03:51:03,820
Oh my god!

6404
03:51:04,880 --> 03:51:06,740
These are messed up, man.

6405
03:51:06,880 --> 03:51:08,300
These are messed up.

6406
03:51:10,880 --> 03:51:11,820
Oh my goodness.

6407
03:51:12,520 --> 03:51:17,920
I can only do it because you- Because you are here too.

6408
03:51:17,960 --> 03:51:18,880
Oh, is that true?

6409
03:51:19,140 --> 03:51:21,980
Oh my, the staff is really upset now.

6410
03:51:22,260 --> 03:51:25,260
The lack of proper leadership has really twisted their fanny cheeks.

6411
03:51:25,700 --> 03:51:26,040
Hard.

6412
03:51:26,200 --> 03:51:27,440
Where's the appreciation?

6413
03:51:27,800 --> 03:51:29,460
Where's the sparkly money's at?

6414
03:51:29,620 --> 03:51:30,400
Oh yeah.

6415
03:51:30,700 --> 03:51:31,520
Good one, bro.

6416
03:51:31,820 --> 03:52:03,520

6418
03:52:32,900 --> 03:52:33,480
It's...

6419
03:52:33,780 --> 03:52:34,540
You should be.

6420
03:52:35,780 --> 03:52:36,160
Bang!

6421
03:52:36,280 --> 03:52:37,040
This is chat right now.

6422
03:52:37,440 --> 03:52:37,460
No!

6423
03:52:37,460 --> 03:52:37,980
No!

6424
03:52:40,840 --> 03:52:41,840
It's terrible.

6425
03:52:42,420 --> 03:52:45,000
Everyone's naked and rioting and pooping on the floor.

6426
03:52:45,400 --> 03:52:45,580
No!

6427
03:52:45,900 --> 03:52:47,440
Clawing the expensive curtains.

6428
03:52:47,600 --> 03:52:48,120
Come on, guys.

6429
03:52:48,260 --> 03:52:48,760
They're expensive.

6430
03:52:49,380 --> 03:52:52,040
Everything is going up in a horrifying blaze of chaos.

6431
03:52:52,660 --> 03:52:56,360
Plus, the picnic was cancelled and I've kind of got a little headache coming on.

6432
03:52:56,520 --> 03:52:57,780
It just never ends.

6433
03:52:58,200 --> 03:52:59,840
But go forth and give it your all.

6434
03:53:00,220 --> 03:53:00,800

Wait, so there is...

03:53:36,560 --> 03:53:37,880
I think people were right.

6441
03:53:37,940 --> 03:53:38,880
There are eight chapters.

6442
03:53:39,940 --> 03:53:40,900
Are there eight chapters?

6443
03:53:41,100 --> 03:53:41,580
Uh-uh.

6444
03:53:42,340 --> 03:53:43,140
Oh, my goodness.

6445
03:53:43,300 --> 03:53:44,240
We gotta lock in.

6446
03:53:44,340 --> 03:53:44,720
Yeah.

6447
03:53:47,700 --> 03:53:48,660

6451
03:53:51,420 --> 03:53:51,740
That's okay.

6452
03:53:52,160 --> 03:53:52,700
Yeah, I already went in.

6453
03:53:52,720 --> 03:53:54,700
I think it's the same amount as usual, anyway.

6454
03:53:54,940 --> 03:53:55,520
Yeah, probably.

6455
03:53:56,060 --> 03:53:56,280
Yeah.

6456
03:53:56,520 --> 03:53:58,380
Gems of three will set you free.

03:53:59,260 --> 03:53:59,920
Okay, okay.

6458
03:54:00,140 --> 03:54:00,420
Okay.

03:54:00,820 --> 03:54:02,060
We just gotta lock in.

6460
03:54:02,220 --> 03:54:02,820
We don't have to...

6461
03:54:02,820 --> 03:54:04,800
Oh my... Wait, look at that!

6462
03:54:04,900 --> 03:54:05,380
Look at that!

6466
03:54:12,840 --> 03:54:13,400

03:54:13,400 --> 03:54:13,680
Okay.

6469
03:54:17,620 --> 03:54:18,960
Uh, let's see.

6470
03:54:21,000 --> 03:54:21,560
What?

6471
03:54:21,920 --> 03:54:22,260
Okay.

6472
03:54:23,920 --> 03:54:24,480
And...

6473
03:54:24,480 --> 03:54:26,060
Oh my god, everything is... Ow!

6474
03:54:27,220 --> 03:54:27,780
Nice.

6475
03:54:31,740 --> 03:54:32,020
Okay.

6476
03:54:32,160 --> 03:54:32,440
Not one.

6477
03:54:32,640 --> 03:54:32,920
Uh-oh.

6478
03:54:33,260 --> 03:54:33,600
Uh-oh.

6479
03:54:33,600 --> 03:54:33,860
Uh-oh.

6480
03:54:35,260 --> 03:54:35,880
Oh, shoot.

6481
03:54:36,260 --> 03:54:37,560
Oh, ow.

6482
03:54:38,040 --> 03:54:38,460
Oh, pfft.

6483
03:54:39,000 --> 03:54:39,640
Double kill.

6484
03:54:40,200 --> 03:54:41,700
Oh, I'm fine

6485
03:54:55,260 --> 03:54:55,620
now.

6486
03:54:56,680 --> 03:54:58,000
But we definitely...

6487
03:54:58,000 --> 03:54:58,760
Oh, oh, oh, there we

6488
03:55:07,240 --> 03:55:07,400
go.

6489
03:55:08,060 --> 03:55:08,460
It's okay.

6490
03:55:08,580 --> 03:55:08,820
It's okay.

6491
03:55:09,380 --> 03:55:10,080
Yeah, put it to that.

6492
03:55:12,080 --> 03:55:12,720
Oh, okay.

6493
03:55:14,220 --> 03:55:14,540
It's

6494
03:55:20,130 --> 03:55:20,650
in a loop now.

6495
03:55:20,850 --> 03:55:21,750
Oh, it's in a loop, too.

6496
03:55:21,770 --> 03:55:22,010
We're good.

6497
03:55:27,600 --> 03:55:27,660
Okay.

6498
03:55:27,660 --> 03:55:28,220
Oh, God.

6499
03:55:28,300 --> 03:55:28,660
I'm sorry.

6500
03:55:28,820 --> 03:55:29,040
I'm sorry.

6501
03:55:29,780 --> 03:55:30,700
Maybe I'll just leave it to you.

6502
03:55:30,780 --> 03:55:31,400
I'll just leave it to you.

6503
03:55:31,940 --> 03:55:32,580
I'm trying.

6504
03:55:35,080 --> 03:55:35,940
Oh, my God.

6505
03:55:40,500 --> 03:55:40,820
How

6506
03:55:44,580 --> 03:55:45,940
do I get back to you?

6507
03:55:46,500 --> 03:55:46,900
Uh-oh.

6508
03:55:47,100 --> 03:55:48,600
I don't think I can get back to you.

6509
03:55:49,580 --> 03:55:50,420
Oh, you did it!

6510
03:55:50,440 --> 03:55:51,340
I got it, I got it, I got it!

6511
03:55:51,440 --> 03:55:51,880
It's okay, it's okay.

6512
03:55:52,120 --> 03:55:52,280
Okay.

6513
03:55:52,700 --> 03:55:53,640
What is that news for?

6514
03:55:54,440 --> 03:55:55,340
A bunch of stuff.

6515
03:55:56,400 --> 03:55:57,820
Oh, wait, no, we needed to...

6516
03:55:57,820 --> 03:55:59,840
Oh, wait, no, I messed up the boat.

6517
03:56:07,450 --> 03:56:07,990
Oh, reset.

6518
03:56:08,510 --> 03:56:08,570
It's okay.

6519
03:56:09,030 --> 03:56:09,590
No, it's okay.

6520
03:56:13,450 --> 03:56:14,130
Where am I?

6521
03:56:14,250 --> 03:56:15,350
You're down in the bottom.

6522
03:56:15,470 --> 03:56:15,990
I'm like...

6523
03:56:15,990 --> 03:56:18,190
I don't think I can do anything up here.

6524
03:56:19,010 --> 03:56:20,990
Yeah, I think you should try... Oh, hello.

6525
03:56:21,330 --> 03:56:21,510
Hello.

6526
03:56:21,850 --> 03:56:23,290
Oh, I don't know what to do here though.

6527
03:56:24,030 --> 03:56:25,190
Oh, we need another boulder, I guess.

6528
03:56:27,890 --> 03:56:28,450
Oh, shoot.

6529
03:56:31,650 --> 03:56:32,870
Oh, fuck.

6530
03:56:33,390 --> 03:56:34,070
Get on my head.

6531
03:56:37,020 --> 03:56:38,160
Get on my head.

6532
03:56:38,400 --> 03:56:39,320
Ah, the timing!

6533
03:56:40,040 --> 03:56:40,480
The timing.

6534
03:56:40,700 --> 03:56:40,860
Okay.

6535
03:56:41,100 --> 03:56:42,240
Oh, why am I down here?

6536
03:56:44,660 --> 03:56:44,980
Okay.

6537
03:56:46,180 --> 03:56:47,000
Get on my head.

6538
03:56:47,680 --> 03:56:48,420

Uh...

6543
03:57:25,760 --> 03:57:26,240

Okay.

6547
03:57:30,760 --> 03:57:31,460
And then...

6548
03:57:31,460 --> 03:57:32,180
There's an alien.

6549
03:57:32,380 --> 03:57:33,100
Oh, I went the wrong way.

6550
03:57:33,100 --> 03:57:33,480
Oh, my God.

6551
03:57:34,440 --> 03:57:35,140
Oh, oh, it's okay.

6552
03:57:35,920 --> 03:57:36,360
Oh, my God.

6553
03:57:36,520 --> 03:57:37,280
There's also a robot.

6554
03:57:38,060 --> 03:57:39,840
There's a great alien and a robot.

6555
03:57:40,400 --> 03:57:40,840
There's...

6556
03:57:40,840 --> 03:57:41,760
There's so many.

6557
03:57:45,360 --> 03:57:45,800
Uh...

6558
03:57:46,240 --> 03:57:46,680
Or...

6559
03:57:46,680 --> 03:57:47,460
What is...

6560
03:57:47,460 --> 03:57:47,900
What is this?

6561
03:57:48,020 --> 03:57:48,720
Oh, a boulder!

6562
03:57:49,020 --> 03:57:50,680
Yeah, there's a boulder for something.

6563
03:57:51,860 --> 03:57:52,300
Yeah.

6564
03:57:55,230 --> 03:57:56,890
Uh, for what, though?

6565
03:57:58,090 --> 03:58:00,230
I think maybe we have to take it upstairs.

6566
03:58:01,830 --> 03:58:02,950
Or somehow.

6567
03:58:03,710 --> 03:58:04,270
Maybe?

6568
03:58:05,230 --> 03:58:06,010
There was.

6569
03:58:06,190 --> 03:58:07,710
Or we take it to the teleport?

6570
03:58:08,990 --> 03:58:09,890
Do we have to take it up?

6571
03:58:10,650 --> 03:58:13,630
There was another place for a thing.

6572
03:58:14,510 --> 03:58:17,410
I just don't know how to get it up there.

6573
03:58:20,090 --> 03:58:20,650
Uh.

6574
03:58:23,800 --> 03:58:26,040
Maybe we put it in here.

6575
03:58:26,400 --> 03:58:28,000
Maybe we teleported through here.

6576
03:58:30,020 --> 03:58:31,860
I'm not sure how, though.

6577
03:58:32,940 --> 03:58:35,620
I was thinking maybe we use the...

6578
03:58:35,620 --> 03:58:36,660
Like this thing?

6579
03:58:36,740 --> 03:58:37,280
Throw it?

6580
03:58:37,880 --> 03:58:38,620
Yeah, yeah.

6581
03:58:38,700 --> 03:58:39,280
Oh, okay.

6582
03:58:39,520 --> 03:58:39,960
There you go.

6583
03:58:40,100 --> 03:58:40,540
There you go.

6584
03:58:40,680 --> 03:58:41,600
Okay, nice, nice, yeah.

6585
03:58:42,120 --> 03:58:42,320
Okay.

6586
03:58:42,400 --> 03:58:42,920
Nice, nice.

6587
03:58:43,860 --> 03:58:44,660
Awesome, awesome.

6588
03:58:45,160 --> 03:58:46,280
Okay, now let's go this way.

6589
03:58:47,900 --> 03:58:48,940
Okay, what does this do?

6590
03:58:49,700 --> 03:58:49,980
Ah!

6591
03:58:52,760 --> 03:58:53,600
Uh, okay.

6592
03:58:53,960 --> 03:58:57,140
I think I keep it like that, I'm stuck.

6593
03:58:57,840 --> 03:58:58,500
Oh yeah, yeah.

6594
03:58:59,300 --> 03:59:01,080
Oh, oh, oh, and I go right here?

6595
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:02,380
Oh, hello.

6596
03:59:02,660 --> 03:59:03,400
Oh, why?

6597
03:59:03,700 --> 03:59:04,900
You're all the way back at the top.

6598
03:59:05,460 --> 03:59:06,280
Whoa, why?

6599
03:59:06,880 --> 03:59:08,280
Uh, well, I don't know.

6600
03:59:08,720 --> 03:59:10,360
But you can get back to the boulder now.

6601
03:59:10,780 --> 03:59:11,440
See there, there.

6602
03:59:11,740 --> 03:59:12,820
Yeah, and you can put it in.

6603
03:59:13,580 --> 03:59:14,200
God damn it!

6604
03:59:14,240 --> 03:59:14,740
What the heck?

6605
03:59:15,120 --> 03:59:16,160
The boulder killed you.

6606
03:59:16,260 --> 03:59:17,400
The boulder killed you.

6607
03:59:17,700 --> 03:59:18,840

And it should be there, okay.

6618
04:00:03,760 --> 04:00:05,340
Wait, no, you have to, yeah, you have to be there.

6619
04:00:05,380 --> 04:00:05,640
Yeah, go.

6620
04:00:06,140 --> 04:00:06,280
Okay.

6621
04:00:07,720 --> 04:00:08,440
And then...

6622
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:08,680
Okay

6623
04:00:13,200 --> 04:00:13,560
Nice.

6624
04:00:15,360 --> 04:00:15,720
Okay.

6625
04:00:19,780 --> 04:00:20,140
Nice!

6626
04:00:23,500 --> 04:00:23,860
Okay.

6627
04:00:24,520 --> 04:00:24,880
Yeah!

6628
04:00:26,020 --> 04:00:26,380
Yeah!

6629
04:00:27,020 --> 04:00:28,080
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

6630
04:00:30,900 --> 04:00:31,680
All right.

6631
04:00:34,900 --> 04:00:35,800
There's no ball.

6632
04:00:36,440 --> 04:00:37,480
There's no ball.

6633
04:00:38,760 --> 04:00:40,600
Wait, did we get the ball or there was none?

6634
04:00:40,900 --> 04:00:41,940
No, it was trapped.

6635
04:00:42,440 --> 04:00:43,080
Oh, that's right.

6636
04:00:43,260 --> 04:00:43,960
It was the...

6637
04:00:43,960 --> 04:00:45,020
It's okay.

6638
04:00:45,220 --> 04:00:45,860
Don't worry about it.

6639
04:00:49,280 --> 04:00:51,100
You should be cursing me out, Minto.

6640
04:00:52,820 --> 04:00:54,200
Screw you, Barrybug.

6641
04:00:54,300 --> 04:00:56,660
I'm really serious about this game.

6642
04:00:56,940 --> 04:00:57,600
And I'm upset.

6643
04:00:57,640 --> 04:01:00,000
Barrybug lives on 123 Main Street.

6644
04:01:03,160 --> 04:01:17,380
Fairy bug lives One, two, three In my walls In my walls Get it, get it, there you go Thank you The exit's over Where do I go from here?

6646
04:01:33,340 --> 04:01:33,580
Okay, hello.

6647
04:01:33,820 --> 04:01:34,080
Hello.

6648
04:01:34,360 --> 04:01:34,680
Okay.

6649
04:01:35,360 --> 04:01:37,180
Okay, I can throw you into the portal.

6650
04:01:38,020 --> 04:01:38,180
Maybe.

6651
04:01:38,300 --> 04:01:38,820
Oh, maybe not.

6652
04:01:39,020 --> 04:01:39,400
Sorry.

6653
04:01:40,620 --> 04:01:42,740
Wait, I think it's going to send me here.

6654
04:01:44,400 --> 04:01:45,960
Do you think so?

6655
04:01:48,620 --> 04:01:49,580
Oh, my gosh.

6656
04:01:49,620 --> 04:01:51,420
Am I just double jumping poorly?

6657
04:01:51,480 --> 04:01:51,820
How about that?

6658
04:01:54,000 --> 04:01:54,740
There you go.

6659
04:01:55,500 --> 04:01:55,860
Oh, yeah.

6660
04:01:58,320 --> 04:01:59,560
I guess I can go here.

6661
04:01:59,980 --> 04:02:00,380
Ah!

6662
04:02:01,860 --> 04:02:02,540
Go where?

6663
04:02:03,260 --> 04:02:04,020
Oh my god!

6664
04:02:09,660 --> 04:02:09,940
Oh my god!

6665
04:02:09,940 --> 04:02:10,920
Oh no, is that where we came from?

6666
04:02:11,020 --> 04:02:12,200
Is that where we came from?

6667
04:02:12,720 --> 04:02:16,580
We need to figure out a way to...

6668
04:02:16,580 --> 04:02:19,120
We need to figure out a way to...

6669
04:02:19,120 --> 04:02:19,300
Oh.

6670
04:02:19,720 --> 04:02:20,780
I'm trying to get up here.

6671
04:02:20,840 --> 04:02:21,240
There we go.

6672
04:02:21,420 --> 04:02:21,600
Thank you.

6673
04:02:21,620 --> 04:02:21,940
There you go.

6674
04:02:23,300 --> 04:02:24,920
Oh, that was a close one.

6675
04:02:27,300 --> 04:02:27,660
Oh!

6676
04:02:31,860 --> 04:02:32,820
Can I just run?

6677
04:02:33,060 --> 04:02:33,260
Run.

6678
04:02:34,400 --> 04:02:35,140
You got it?

6679
04:02:35,380 --> 04:02:35,660
Yep.

6680
04:02:35,660 --> 04:02:36,580
Okay, nice.

6681
04:02:37,180 --> 04:02:39,080
I guess up here we break in.

6682
04:02:39,340 --> 04:02:39,860
What is this?

6683
04:02:40,220 --> 04:02:40,640
But...

6684
04:02:40,640 --> 04:02:40,660
Yeah.

6685
04:02:40,960 --> 04:02:41,820
Oh, you want to go up?

6686
04:02:42,000 --> 04:02:42,420
I don't know.

6687
04:02:42,820 --> 04:02:43,600
I don't think so.

6688
04:02:43,700 --> 04:02:44,200
I don't think so.

6689
04:02:44,580 --> 04:02:45,360
Oh, get the boat.

6690
04:02:46,380 --> 04:02:47,220
Yeah, get the boat.

6691
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:50,960
But then we have like a...

6692
04:02:50,960 --> 04:02:51,120
Oh!

6693
04:02:51,920 --> 04:02:52,360
Oh!

6694
04:02:52,700 --> 04:02:53,120
Oh!

6695
04:02:54,360 --> 04:02:56,040
Oh, oh, we have to...

6696
04:02:56,040 --> 04:02:56,340
Hold on.

6697
04:02:56,380 --> 04:02:56,920
Let me beat...

6698
04:02:56,920 --> 04:02:57,900
Let me beat you this one.

6699
04:02:58,060 --> 04:02:58,720
Oh, yeah!

6700
04:02:58,900 --> 04:03:01,720
We gotta turn off the fan.

6701
04:03:02,040 --> 04:03:03,000
And then...

6702
04:03:04,540 --> 04:03:04,980
That'll...

6703
04:03:04,980 --> 04:03:05,640
Oh my god.

6704
04:03:05,660 --> 04:03:07,860
It's taking a sweet-ass time.

6705
04:03:10,040 --> 04:03:11,240
And boom.

6706
04:03:17,360 --> 04:03:18,580
And then do that.

6707
04:03:18,760 --> 04:03:19,340
Oh, okay.

6708
04:03:19,680 --> 04:03:21,580
Whoa, that opened up everything in the world.

6709
04:03:23,000 --> 04:03:23,300
Okay.

6710
04:03:24,140 --> 04:03:24,500
Okay.

6711
04:03:25,800 --> 04:03:27,000
And then...

6712
04:03:27,000 --> 04:03:27,840
Did that turn off?

6713
04:03:27,960 --> 04:03:28,680
Oh, we're back here.

6714
04:03:31,920 --> 04:03:32,520
Huh?

6715
04:03:36,200 --> 04:03:36,600
Howie.

6716
04:03:36,980 --> 04:03:37,420
Oh, oops.

6717
04:03:37,760 --> 04:03:38,160
I feel it.

6718
04:03:38,180 --> 04:03:41,300
We need the little guys, the pink guys.

6719
04:03:41,600 --> 04:03:43,480
Yeah, we definitely need them to get...

6720
04:03:43,480 --> 04:03:44,440
Oh, oopsie.

6721
04:03:46,420 --> 04:03:48,660
That's what I was trying to do earlier was like...

6722
04:03:48,660 --> 04:03:49,080
Yeah, yeah.

6723
04:03:49,480 --> 04:03:50,220
But maybe not.

6724
04:03:50,440 --> 04:03:51,100
No, I think you're...

6725
04:03:51,100 --> 04:03:51,740
I think it's right.

6726
04:03:51,880 --> 04:03:52,400
I think it's right.

6727
04:03:52,780 --> 04:03:53,120
Really?

6728
04:03:53,300 --> 04:03:53,580
Yeah.

6729
04:03:55,460 --> 04:03:56,600
It's just hard to attempt.

6730
04:04:03,020 --> 04:04:04,640
I don't have to put...

6731
04:04:04,640 --> 04:04:05,320
Hold on, hold on.

6732
04:04:05,740 --> 04:04:06,060
Okay, okay.

6733
04:04:07,240 --> 04:04:07,640
Yeah!

6734
04:04:07,640 --> 04:04:08,620
There you go.

6735
04:04:08,800 --> 04:04:08,800
See?

6736
04:04:09,020 --> 04:04:09,020
See?

6737
04:04:09,700 --> 04:04:10,420
Yeah, you got it.

6738
04:04:10,480 --> 04:04:10,810
You got it.

6739
04:04:14,020 --> 04:04:14,360
No!

6740
04:04:15,960 --> 04:04:16,500
It's fine.

6741
04:04:16,640 --> 04:04:17,160
I got him up here.

6742
04:04:17,240 --> 04:04:17,700
I got him up here.

6743
04:04:17,840 --> 04:04:18,280
Yeah, you got it ready.

6744
04:04:18,400 --> 04:04:18,740
You got it ready.

6745
04:04:18,940 --> 04:04:19,220
Oh, oops.

6746
04:04:19,340 --> 04:04:19,560
My bad.

6747
04:04:21,580 --> 04:04:21,960
Okay.

6748
04:04:22,300 --> 04:04:22,680
Okay.

6749
04:04:23,900 --> 04:04:24,280
Yeah!

6750
04:04:24,280 --> 04:04:25,000
In here.

6751
04:04:25,980 --> 04:04:26,600
In there?

6752
04:04:27,440 --> 04:04:27,820
No.

6753
04:04:28,160 --> 04:04:28,540
Oops.

6754
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:31,380
Okay.

6755
04:04:32,360 --> 04:04:33,480
Oh, my bad.

6756
04:04:33,760 --> 04:04:34,020
Okay.

6757
04:04:35,020 --> 04:04:37,620
And then, I don't know how you would come over here.

6758
04:04:37,640 --> 04:04:38,840
My pig is invincible.

6759
04:04:40,780 --> 04:04:41,620
Wait, okay.

6760
04:04:41,920 --> 04:04:43,640
I somehow...

6761
04:04:46,180 --> 04:04:46,540
Um...

6762
04:04:46,540 --> 04:04:49,840
I think I can't make it.

6763
04:04:51,320 --> 04:04:51,680
Did...

6764
04:04:51,680 --> 04:04:52,980
Oh, wait.

6765
04:04:53,680 --> 04:04:57,780
Leave your guy over there and then do the help thing and then my pig will come over.

6766
04:04:58,300 --> 04:04:59,240
Oh, wait.

6767
04:04:59,400 --> 04:04:59,900
I made it.

6768
04:04:59,960 --> 04:05:00,200
Oh, wait.

6769
04:05:00,220 --> 04:05:00,800
No, it works out.

6770
04:05:00,880 --> 04:05:01,180
It worked out.

6771
04:05:01,340 --> 04:05:01,380
Yeah.

6772
04:05:01,380 --> 04:05:02,900
Wait, what am I supposed to do here, though?

6773
04:05:03,040 --> 04:05:03,700
Oh, I go...

6774
04:05:03,700 --> 04:05:04,040
And then you...

6775
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:04,780
Yeah, okay, okay.

6776
04:05:05,000 --> 04:05:05,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6777
04:05:06,700 --> 04:05:07,060
Oh.

6778
04:05:07,640 --> 04:05:09,060
Oh, again, whatever.

6779
04:05:09,480 --> 04:05:09,840
Okay.

6780
04:05:10,360 --> 04:05:11,320
Well, what is this to do?

6781
04:05:12,960 --> 04:05:13,120
Ah!

6782
04:05:14,220 --> 04:05:14,580
Ah!

6783
04:05:15,080 --> 04:05:15,300
Ah!

6784
04:05:17,080 --> 04:05:18,560
What is this to do?

6785
04:05:20,180 --> 04:05:20,540
Um...

6786
04:05:20,540 --> 04:05:22,620
It makes it so...

6787
04:05:23,160 --> 04:05:24,140
We can run.

6788
04:05:24,720 --> 04:05:27,680
Oh, yeah, I think we gotta do the thing where you, like, push me over again, you know?

6789
04:05:28,360 --> 04:05:29,080
You think so?

6790
04:05:29,160 --> 04:05:29,380
Yeah.

6791
04:05:29,540 --> 04:05:29,640
Okay, okay.

6792
04:05:30,180 --> 04:05:30,380
Wait.

6793
04:05:30,580 --> 04:05:33,040
Oh, I didn't get enough momentum, my bad.

6794
04:05:33,540 --> 04:05:33,980
Okay, ready?

6795
04:05:34,600 --> 04:05:34,840
Wait!

6796
04:05:35,240 --> 04:05:35,980
No, I don't...

6797
04:05:35,980 --> 04:05:36,860
Oh, wait, wait.

6798
04:05:36,940 --> 04:05:37,460
No, no, no, no, no.

6799
04:05:37,640 --> 04:05:39,780
It's supposed to be...

6800
04:05:40,240 --> 04:05:41,640
We put it here.

6801
04:05:42,700 --> 04:05:43,640
And then you...

6802
04:05:46,380 --> 04:05:47,260
How would you...

6803
04:05:47,260 --> 04:05:48,040
How would you do that?

6804
04:05:48,780 --> 04:05:49,580
Do you do it by yourself?

6805
04:05:50,020 --> 04:05:50,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

6806
04:05:51,120 --> 04:05:51,920
Oh, oh, oh!

6807
04:05:51,920 --> 04:05:53,120
I turned it off on accident though.

6808
04:05:53,120 --> 04:05:53,320
You got it!

6809
04:05:53,420 --> 04:05:53,900
You got it!

6810
04:05:54,020 --> 04:05:54,200
Yeah.

6811
04:05:54,360 --> 04:05:54,840
No, no, no, no, no.

6812
04:05:54,860 --> 04:05:55,660
You're just supposed to run.

6813
04:05:55,780 --> 04:05:56,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

6814
04:05:57,840 --> 04:05:58,200
Yeah, okay.

6815
04:06:00,560 --> 04:06:01,540
But now what?

6816
04:06:02,220 --> 04:06:03,080
Where's the exit?

6817
04:06:04,820 --> 04:06:07,340
The ball of yarn is over there too is the thing.

6818
04:06:07,640 --> 04:06:08,780
The exit's right over there.

6819
04:06:08,880 --> 04:06:10,780
Like, once we get sent here.

6820
04:06:12,240 --> 04:06:12,960
Oh, I see.

6821
04:06:13,320 --> 04:06:14,420
Oh, but the ball of yarn.

6822
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:15,900
But the ball of yarn.

6823
04:06:16,340 --> 04:06:16,780
Ew.

6824
04:06:18,360 --> 04:06:18,580
Ew.

6825
04:06:19,860 --> 04:06:20,760
Ew, what the...

6826
04:06:20,760 --> 04:06:22,060
Was it always making that noise?

6827
04:06:22,520 --> 04:06:22,860
Ew.

6828
04:06:23,120 --> 04:06:23,860
I don't know.

6829
04:06:24,380 --> 04:06:24,820
Ew.

6830
04:06:25,140 --> 04:06:26,380
I thought that was you for a second.

6831
04:06:26,480 --> 04:06:27,080
I was like, whoa.

6832
04:06:27,380 --> 04:06:28,260
Are you eating?

6833
04:06:30,680 --> 04:06:31,560
It's horrible.

6834
04:06:32,880 --> 04:06:33,900
Okay, I think we should...

6835
04:06:33,900 --> 04:06:34,840
We could just end it.

6836
04:06:35,000 --> 04:06:35,340
Okay.

6837
04:06:36,480 --> 04:06:36,920
Okay.

6838
04:06:37,640 --> 04:06:39,220
The shlop, shlop, shlop.

6839
04:06:39,600 --> 04:06:41,220
It's so horrible.

6840
04:06:42,180 --> 04:06:43,480
Oh my god.

6841
04:06:44,040 --> 04:06:45,080
Oh my god.

6842
04:06:45,460 --> 04:06:46,080
That was terrible.

6843
04:06:47,160 --> 04:06:51,820
It was so bad.

6844
04:06:54,000 --> 04:06:54,080
Oh.

6845
04:06:55,340 --> 04:06:56,960
I'm trying to get hungry though, Barry.

6846
04:06:57,140 --> 04:06:58,200
I want dinner soon.

6847
04:06:59,120 --> 04:07:01,820
Alright, we could probably do this level and then wrap up.

6848
04:07:01,860 --> 04:07:02,100
Okay.

6849
04:07:03,000 --> 04:07:03,480
Yeah.

6850
04:07:03,960 --> 04:07:04,620
I'm gonna get tied.

6851
04:07:04,620 --> 04:07:06,360
It might take a while on the last few levels.

6852
04:07:06,880 --> 04:07:06,880
I know.

6853
04:07:07,080 --> 04:07:12,640
I'm feeling like Like, how, did we gaslight ourselves into thinking there was less than there actually was?

6854
04:07:13,860 --> 04:07:17,520
No, we're like, I think it's just we didn't expect how hard it would be.

6855
04:07:17,780 --> 04:07:21,580
We didn't expect it to be, like, so, so difficult.

6856
04:07:25,360 --> 04:07:26,680
Yeah, it, like, really ramped up.

6857
04:07:26,680 --> 04:07:28,400
I know, it did ramp up like crazy.

6858
04:07:28,600 --> 04:07:28,980
Oh, wait.

6859
04:07:29,800 --> 04:07:30,080
Jesus.

6860
04:07:30,480 --> 04:07:31,120
Oh, goodbye?

6861
04:07:31,500 --> 04:07:31,760
Hello?

6862
04:07:32,700 --> 04:07:33,180
Hello?

6863
04:07:33,640 --> 04:07:34,040
Hi.

6864
04:07:34,480 --> 04:07:36,260
I don't know how I got here.

6865
04:07:37,260 --> 04:07:38,480
Uh, okay.

6866
04:07:38,560 --> 04:07:38,760
Yay!

6867
04:07:42,090 --> 04:07:42,710
Oh, okay.

6868
04:07:42,990 --> 04:07:43,670
Oh, that.

6869
04:07:44,950 --> 04:07:45,670
Oh, oopsie.

6870
04:07:46,150 --> 04:07:47,190
Jesus, it's okay.

6871
04:07:47,470 --> 04:07:49,510
But I don't know, how would you get over there?

6872
04:07:49,650 --> 04:07:51,170
Wait, how did you press the right trigger?

6873
04:07:52,570 --> 04:07:52,930
Hmm.

6874
04:07:54,330 --> 04:07:54,970
There we go.

6875
04:07:55,230 --> 04:07:55,450
Okay.

6876
04:07:55,890 --> 04:07:56,710
Oh, oh, oh.

6877
04:07:57,810 --> 04:07:59,390
It's me, I'm screwing up.

6878
04:07:59,770 --> 04:08:00,910
No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.

6879
04:08:02,950 --> 04:08:03,890
Maybe you go on the ladder.

6880
04:08:06,130 --> 04:08:07,310
Oh, no, you got it, you got it.

6881
04:08:07,510 --> 04:08:07,910
Oh, shoot.

6882
04:08:08,210 --> 04:08:09,010
Oh, okay.

6883
04:08:10,530 --> 04:08:10,890
Okay.

6884
04:08:11,570 --> 04:08:11,930
Okay.

6885
04:08:11,930 --> 04:08:11,990
Oh.

6886
04:08:12,010 --> 04:08:12,630
Holy moly.

6887
04:08:13,470 --> 04:08:13,470
Okay.

6888
04:08:15,010 --> 04:08:15,410
Okay.

6889
04:08:15,690 --> 04:08:15,750
Okay.

6890
04:08:15,750 --> 04:08:17,010
I gotta wait for him to...

6891
04:08:22,420 --> 04:08:23,020
Look at him.

6892
04:08:23,280 --> 04:08:23,460
Okay.

6893
04:08:25,840 --> 04:08:27,200
Well, there's no button!

6894
04:08:28,160 --> 04:08:29,240
I know, I don't know.

6895
04:08:29,560 --> 04:08:31,000
I don't know what you're supposed to do.

6896
04:08:31,240 --> 04:08:32,080
Oh, oh, oopsie.

6897
04:08:32,160 --> 04:08:32,880
Let me use your body.

6898
04:08:33,100 --> 04:08:34,000
Yeah, use my body.

6899
04:08:34,240 --> 04:08:34,840
Use my body.

6900
04:08:35,140 --> 04:08:36,260
There's so many things.

6901
04:08:36,800 --> 04:08:38,380
Okay, but how do you get all the...

6902
04:08:38,380 --> 04:08:39,960
I guess you have to...

6903
04:08:39,960 --> 04:08:42,880
At some point, they'll, like, let you go back and...

6904
04:08:42,880 --> 04:08:43,640
Do you have a level?

6905
04:08:44,200 --> 04:08:44,760
Wait, what?

6906
04:08:44,820 --> 04:08:45,800
No, we missed the button!

6907
04:08:46,300 --> 04:08:47,460
We missed a button?

6908
04:08:49,660 --> 04:08:51,940
Yeah, it's at the beginning, I guess?

6909
04:08:52,140 --> 04:08:53,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

6910
04:08:54,800 --> 04:08:55,700
Oh, oh.

6911
04:08:56,580 --> 04:08:58,500
No, no, no, no, no, we have to just get through this.

6912
04:08:58,600 --> 04:08:59,960
And then I think the button's at the end.

6913
04:09:00,680 --> 04:09:01,920
Oh, my God, it's ice.

6914
04:09:02,920 --> 04:09:04,780
No, you go, oh, my God, wait, you're such a gamer.

6915
04:09:06,200 --> 04:09:08,140
Yeah, and then you go...

6916
04:09:08,140 --> 04:09:08,740
I gave it!

6917
04:09:08,740 --> 04:09:10,660
Oh, my God, what is this?

6918
04:09:13,340 --> 04:09:13,960
First try?

6919
04:09:16,260 --> 04:09:16,980
Try first try.

6920
04:09:17,500 --> 04:09:17,900
Uh-oh.

6921
04:09:18,040 --> 04:09:19,180
Oh, and then...

6922
04:09:19,180 --> 04:09:19,760
Oh, okay.

6923
04:09:20,080 --> 04:09:21,340
And then we do it again!

6924
04:09:22,580 --> 04:09:24,780
Without the boxes this time.

6925
04:09:25,280 --> 04:09:26,360
Yeah, without the box.

6926
04:09:26,360 --> 04:09:26,960
Oh, my bad.

6927
04:09:27,200 --> 04:09:27,940
I was not prepared.

6928
04:09:28,000 --> 04:09:29,820
I was not prepared.

6929
04:09:29,880 --> 04:09:30,780
Oh, I was sorry.

6930
04:09:30,960 --> 04:09:31,620
Here, you go.

6931
04:09:31,760 --> 04:09:31,940
You go.

6932
04:09:32,040 --> 04:09:32,260
It's okay.

6933
04:09:32,660 --> 04:09:33,100
Oh, okay, okay.

6934
04:09:33,280 --> 04:09:34,060
There you go.

6935
04:09:38,100 --> 04:09:39,660
You were eating that.

6936
04:09:39,680 --> 04:09:41,300
You were eating that for real.

6937
04:09:42,020 --> 04:09:43,040
Oh, my God.

6938
04:09:44,240 --> 04:09:45,080
Holy moly.

6939
04:09:46,260 --> 04:09:47,820
I think you can get in there, yeah.

6940
04:09:47,960 --> 04:09:48,400
There you go.

6941
04:09:50,260 --> 04:09:50,980
Thank you.

6942
04:09:52,140 --> 04:09:52,540
Yeah.

6943
04:09:53,400 --> 04:09:55,620
Why is my right trigger acting up?

6944
04:09:55,800 --> 04:09:56,140
Oh, it's fine.

6945
04:09:56,580 --> 04:09:57,200
Uh-oh.

6946
04:09:58,180 --> 04:09:59,720
Oh, that explains all the...

6947
04:09:59,720 --> 04:10:00,920
That explains why that...

6948
04:10:00,920 --> 04:10:01,400
There is that.

6949
04:10:01,600 --> 04:10:03,140
It's like temporary stuff, guys.

6950
04:10:04,880 --> 04:10:05,480
Oh, Minto!

6951
04:10:05,860 --> 04:10:06,000
Oops.

6952
04:10:06,140 --> 04:10:06,540
Not bad.

6953
04:10:06,740 --> 04:10:10,000
Oh, shit.

6954
04:10:10,320 --> 04:10:10,500
Oh.

6955
04:10:10,860 --> 04:10:11,400
Hold on.

6956
04:10:11,480 --> 04:10:11,880
Yeah, yeah.

6957
04:10:11,940 --> 04:10:12,460
Get on my head.

6958
04:10:16,630 --> 04:10:17,290
Nice, nice.

6959
04:10:17,370 --> 04:10:17,750
There we go.

6960
04:10:18,250 --> 04:10:18,430
Okay.

6961
04:10:18,490 --> 04:10:19,810
Is there a secret over there though?

6962
04:10:21,410 --> 04:10:23,430
Wait, because there's a ladder up there.

6963
04:10:24,490 --> 04:10:25,270
What on, send me over?

6964
04:10:28,830 --> 04:10:30,870
Oh, I don't think so.

6965
04:10:31,110 --> 04:10:32,130
Never mind, never mind, never mind.

6966
04:10:32,170 --> 04:10:32,650
Don't worry about it.

6967
04:10:33,030 --> 04:10:34,490
Hannah, you're me!

6968
04:10:34,730 --> 04:10:36,170
Thank you so much for the...

6969
04:10:36,170 --> 04:10:37,330
Thank you so much for the raid.

6970
04:10:37,510 --> 04:10:37,990
Hi, Hannah.

6971
04:10:38,530 --> 04:10:39,590
Thank you for the bait!

6972
04:10:39,770 --> 04:10:40,270
Let me read the...

6973
04:10:40,270 --> 04:10:40,730
There you go!

6974
04:10:41,090 --> 04:10:41,450
Nice.

6975
04:10:44,050 --> 04:10:44,310
Alright.

6976
04:10:45,070 --> 04:10:45,430
Oh!

6977
04:10:45,770 --> 04:10:46,230
Oh, nice!

6978
04:10:46,410 --> 04:10:46,770
Oh, nice!

6979
04:10:48,670 --> 04:10:49,910
Wait, where was it?

6980
04:10:50,130 --> 04:10:50,510
Oh, here.

6981
04:10:51,130 --> 04:10:51,870
Yeah, the teleporter?

6982
04:10:52,030 --> 04:10:53,190
Okay, there we go.

6983
04:10:54,850 --> 04:10:55,110
Oh!

6984
04:10:55,350 --> 04:10:56,670
Oh, it shot me too.

6985
04:10:56,870 --> 04:10:57,990
Okay, that's cool.

6986
04:11:01,170 --> 04:11:01,390
Oops.

6987
04:11:02,030 --> 04:11:03,050
That's a new one.

6988
04:11:05,050 --> 04:11:05,830
You're good.

6989
04:11:07,750 --> 04:11:08,890

6992
04:11:14,470 --> 04:11:15,490

Okay.

Yeah, oh!

6996
04:11:20,270 --> 04:11:21,930
There was a secret in there.

6997
04:11:22,330 --> 04:11:23,930
Oh, me too.

6998
04:11:25,570 --> 04:11:29,030
Yeah, this game's old.

6999
04:11:30,430 --> 04:11:33,150
Wait, oh, I've mixed up my character with yours.

7000
04:11:33,910 --> 04:11:36,390
Yeah, it's pretty easy.

7001
04:11:38,930 --> 04:11:39,490
Sorry.

04:11:44,910 --> 04:11:47,390
Oh, come on, I already did this, please.

7005
04:11:49,870 --> 04:11:51,830
I don't know where that came out.

7006
04:11:52,610 --> 04:11:56,930
Oh, oh, please, Barry, just make it.

7007
04:11:57,110 --> 04:11:57,690

Okay, there we go.

04:12:01,430 --> 04:12:01,650
Okay.

7010

04:12:02,610 --> 04:12:03,290
Oh, my gosh.

7012
04:12:04,470 --> 04:12:05,750
Wait, why am I in here?

7013
04:12:08,710 --> 04:12:10,350
Is there no secret?

7014
04:12:10,810 --> 04:12:11,070
Okay.

7015
04:12:11,550 --> 04:12:12,270

04:12:13,930 --> 04:12:14,250
Okay.

Ah!

7020
04:12:18,490 --> 04:12:19,670
See, it was so easy.

7021
04:12:20,250 --> 04:12:20,830
You should do it.

7022
04:12:21,910 --> 04:12:23,550
Hey, hey, hey.

7023
04:12:24,350 --> 04:12:24,450

04:12:39,760 --> 04:12:40,320
That's true.

7028
04:12:40,600 --> 04:12:42,780

7034
04:12:51,800 --> 04:12:52,480
All right.

Did you see what you got?

7059
04:13:33,220 --> 04:13:33,760
It was like a bear.

7060
04:13:33,860 --> 04:13:34,560
It was cute.

7061
04:13:34,980 --> 04:13:35,960
Oh, I like the teeth.

7062
04:13:37,540 --> 04:13:39,800

04:13:49,000 --> 04:13:49,640
A shark.

7067
04:13:51,160 --> 04:13:51,760
Eyeball.

04:14:10,940 --> 04:14:12,200
It's not letting me buy.

7080
04:14:12,320 --> 04:14:14,040
I think I bought everything, maybe, that they have.

7081
04:14:14,040 --> 04:14:14,600

Yeah, oh, okay.

7092
04:14:30,760 --> 04:14:32,540
Yeah, I don't know if you would use the yarns for it.

7093
04:14:33,740 --> 04:14:34,900
What's the fan do?

7094
04:14:36,060 --> 04:14:37,200

04:20:11,150 --> 04:20:11,710
Oh, my gosh.

7168
04:20:12,070 --> 04:20:13,250
Oh, my gosh.

7169
04:20:13,410 --> 04:20:13,890
Ah.

7170
04:20:14,770 --> 04:20:15,410
Busy.

7171
04:20:15,610 --> 04:20:18,530
So busy lately, my mind.

7172
04:20:21,150 --> 04:20:21,570
Yes.

7173
04:20:21,890 --> 04:20:24,710
The Iron Mouse concert as well.

7174
04:20:27,050 --> 04:20:30,750
Wait, so did I thought I, Yami Mama, maybe announced something.

7175
04:20:30,950 --> 04:20:34,010
But I guess I'll let you guys know that I'll just be there.

7176
04:20:34,230 --> 04:20:37,950
But I'm not, like, appearing in 3D or anything like she did for me.

7177
04:20:39,130 --> 04:20:41,750
I'm just going to be there asking her to do poses.

7178
04:20:46,670 --> 04:20:50,490
Guys, for the next couple of months, I'm not even kidding you.

7179
04:20:51,950 --> 04:20:55,110
It's like, I'm so busy up until Christmas.

7180
04:20:56,070 --> 04:20:58,370
After Christmas, I'm free.

7181
04:21:00,950 --> 04:21:01,670
Until then!

7182
04:21:02,310 --> 04:21:02,510
Oh!

7183
04:21:08,830 --> 04:21:12,110
But some things...

7184
04:21:13,930 --> 04:21:15,410
But things are...

7185
04:21:16,330 --> 04:21:18,590
Not as many things have been announced yet.

7186
04:21:18,790 --> 04:21:20,790
So once they're announced, then...

7187
04:21:20,790 --> 04:21:22,170
You'll be like, wow!

7188
04:21:23,650 --> 04:21:24,190
Wee!

7189
04:21:24,490 --> 04:21:25,910
Ginto has B-Day merch too.

7190
04:21:26,010 --> 04:21:28,110
Oh, that's also until the end of the month!

7191
04:21:28,850 --> 04:21:29,790
My birthday merch!

7192
04:21:30,270 --> 04:21:32,230
I should probably put that like somewhere.

7193
04:21:32,410 --> 04:21:39,490
I mean, do you want to raid the same person?

7194
04:21:41,050 --> 04:21:41,130
Oh, yeah.

7195
04:21:41,130 --> 04:21:42,010
I guess you're on YouTube.

7196
04:21:42,690 --> 04:21:45,150
Oh, I can raid YouTube person, too.

7197
04:21:45,510 --> 04:21:46,330
Who's on YouTube?

7198
04:21:47,890 --> 04:21:48,170
I know.

7199
04:21:48,370 --> 04:21:50,250
We raided Matara last time.

7200
04:21:51,250 --> 04:21:51,630
I feel like...

7201
04:21:51,630 --> 04:21:52,070
Did we?

7202
04:21:52,450 --> 04:21:52,930
Oh, my God.

7203
04:21:52,950 --> 04:21:53,450
We did.

7204
04:21:53,630 --> 04:21:54,510
She caught me a whore.

7205
04:21:55,290 --> 04:21:57,110
Oh, Nimi is streaming.

7206
04:21:58,330 --> 04:21:58,810
Oh, okay.

7207
04:21:59,210 --> 04:21:59,550
Yeah.

7208
04:22:00,550 --> 04:22:00,990
Okay.

7209
04:22:01,270 --> 04:22:01,290
Okay.

7210
04:22:01,290 --> 04:22:02,690
Do you want to raid Nimi Nimi?

7211
04:22:03,770 --> 04:22:04,210
Okay.

7212
04:22:06,830 --> 04:22:07,790
What's wrong?

7213
04:22:09,190 --> 04:22:09,930
I'm shy.

7214
04:22:10,190 --> 04:22:10,990
But also, wait, hold on.

7215
04:22:11,250 --> 04:22:14,770
Let me see if I can write anyone who's Twitch only.

7216
04:22:17,050 --> 04:22:22,870
I'll read someone Twitch only, and then I'll also redirect my YouTube raid to Nimmy as well.

7217
04:22:24,270 --> 04:22:24,670
Okay.

7218
04:22:25,310 --> 04:22:26,450
Sorry, did I...

7219
04:22:26,450 --> 04:22:28,790
You can continue your wrap-up.

7220
04:22:28,970 --> 04:22:29,590
No, it's fine.

7221
04:22:29,690 --> 04:22:31,810
I was just lamenting about...

7222
04:22:31,810 --> 04:22:32,650
Lamenting?

7223
04:22:33,070 --> 04:22:33,530
Oh.

7224
04:22:33,830 --> 04:22:34,210
Oh.

7225
04:22:34,770 --> 04:22:35,910
Oh, no.

7226
04:22:36,470 --> 04:22:36,790
No, no.

7227
04:22:36,830 --> 04:22:37,330
It's okay.

7228
04:22:37,670 --> 04:22:38,730
Don't be so busy.

7229
04:22:38,850 --> 04:22:39,830
Don't be so busy.

7230
04:22:39,990 --> 04:22:40,330
I don't.

7231
04:22:40,370 --> 04:22:41,330
Okay, I'm gonna rain.

7232
04:22:42,150 --> 04:22:45,110
Mia was here earlier, so I'll raid Mia on Twitch.

7233
04:22:45,570 --> 04:22:45,890
Okay.

7234
04:22:47,190 --> 04:22:48,030
Oh, gosh.

7235
04:22:48,210 --> 04:22:49,490
I hate the new YouTube setup.

7236
04:22:49,730 --> 04:22:50,610
It's so bad.

7237
04:22:51,430 --> 04:22:51,810
Uh-oh.

7238
04:22:52,070 --> 04:22:53,090
There's a new YouTube setup?

7239
04:22:53,190 --> 04:22:54,030
Yeah, on the back end.

7240
04:22:54,090 --> 04:22:54,910
Do you not see it?

7241
04:22:56,510 --> 04:22:59,850
Uh, it's the same for me, but maybe it's yet to update for me.

7242
04:22:59,990 --> 04:23:00,610
Oh, maybe.

7243
04:23:01,170 --> 04:23:02,510
Oh, Matara is streaming.

7244
04:23:03,890 --> 04:23:06,110
Do we want to raid Matara again?

7245
04:23:07,290 --> 04:23:07,970
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

7246
04:23:08,290 --> 04:23:09,110
No, you can raid Nimi.

7247
04:23:09,430 --> 04:23:12,570
I can't raid Nimi because I don't think she has me on favorites.

7248
04:23:12,910 --> 04:23:13,390
Oh, then that's...

7249
04:23:13,390 --> 04:23:15,050
Let's raid Matara then.

7250
04:23:15,790 --> 04:23:17,270
Oh, okay, okay, hold on.

7251
04:23:17,310 --> 04:23:17,670
Yeah, yeah.

7252
04:23:17,910 --> 04:23:20,270
Then I'll raid Matara on Twitch as well then.

7253
04:23:20,470 --> 04:23:20,750
Okay.

7254
04:23:21,590 --> 04:23:22,370
Okay, okay.

7255
04:23:22,690 --> 04:23:24,550
Triple Matara raid!

7256
04:23:28,860 --> 04:23:29,520
All right.

7257
04:23:30,420 --> 04:23:32,500
I'll raid Mia next time.

7258
04:23:32,620 --> 04:23:33,620
I'm sorry, Mia.

7259
04:23:34,140 --> 04:23:34,660
Okay.

7260
04:23:35,980 --> 04:23:54,540
