00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,500
Welcome to the company!

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,920
Welcome!

3
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,060
Welcome!

4
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,320
I like

5
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,100
the employees here.

6
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,180
Yeah, all the employees are cute.

7
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,160
They're gonna have a good time at the company.

8
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,650
Yes, please!

9
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,670
Hi!

10
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,610
Banana!

11
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,310
Oh, wow!

12
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,350
She's really good dancer.

13
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,550
Yeah!

14
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,670
Isn't this what you do at work?

15
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,310
You just dance?

16
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,890
Yeah!

17
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,430
Yeah!

18
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,010
Oh my gosh, they're so in sync!

19
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,610
Oh my gosh, yeah!

20
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,110
Should we do introductions?

21
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,490
Yes!

22
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,550
Who wants the cold first?

23
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,190
Order!

24
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,210
Yes, you!

25
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,590
Point?

26
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,370
Ouija?

27
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,310
Ouija?

28
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,890
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

29
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,510
Hi, everyone!

30
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,290
It's Emily!

31
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,950
I'm a housewife Vtuber that plays the violin.

32
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,130
And in my free time, I take care of my friends.

33
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:58,910
Nice to meet you!

34
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,570
And yes, I'm Ouija.

35
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,970
I'm Ouija for this co-op.

36
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,090
I'm green!

37
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,710
Green man!

38
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,210
Green sexy man!

39
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,270
Green sexy man!

40
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,550
Awesome!

41
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,390
Woohoo!

42
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,970
Green nickel man!

43
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,110
Me!

44
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,130
Me!

45
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,790
You!

46
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,030
Hi!

47
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,720
I'm Ayla Coleman from Production Kawaii.

48
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,410
Should I do my intro?

49
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,410
Princess from Another World Vtuber in Your World!

50
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,290
Me?

51
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,110
My world?

52
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,430
No, your world!

53
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,850
Yeah!

54
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,250
Everybody's world!

55
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:38,870
Yeah!

56
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,610
It's my first time playing lethal company ever, so I'll do my best not to die!

57
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:48,870
Yeah!

58
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,210
Yay!

59
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,650
I believe in you!

60
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,450
Yay!

61
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,430
Yay!

62
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,010
Alright, let's go!

63
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,010
No!

64
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,230
No!

65
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,030
Oh no!

66
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
What is she gonna do?

67
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,960
I was gonna point!

68
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,880
Oh my god!

69
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
I was gonna rob her!

70
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:13,960
Yeah!

71
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah!

72
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,380
Yeah!

73
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,520
Eww!

74
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,320
I like tokusatsu.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,180
And I like hard games because I'm a masochist.

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,300
I do silly challenges on my channel.

77
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,140
And that's it!

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,560
Yay!

79
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,140
Yay!

80
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,440
I think you'll like this company if you're a masochist.

81
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,820
Oh, true, true, true.

82
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,800
That's why I apply.

83
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,320
I've got a good CV.

84
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,720
You!

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,760
You!

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,200
Big boss!

87
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,260
Um...

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,120
Hello!

89
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,520
Um...

90
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,540
My name is Mint Phantom.

91
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,820
I'm a ghost maid.

92
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
Um...

93
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm here to suck the life force of others, everybody who I collab with, and everybody who comes to my streams.

94
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,880
Nice to meet Uwu.

95
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,100
Yay!

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,940
Can you suck my life force?

97
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,240
Can you suck my life force?

98
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,860
Please?

99
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,280
Can I what?

100
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,860
Can I what?

101
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,220
Can you suck my life force?

102
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,900
The sucky wucky!

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,200
Oh!

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,140
Oh my god!

105
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,820
For free?

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,700
For free?

107
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,380
Live?

108
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,400
On stream?

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,920
It just kind of happens, you know?

110
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,700
It's like...

111
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,480
On the first day of work?

112
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,720
Oh my god.

113
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,640
It's a team building activity.

114
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,160
Yeah!

115
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
It's an ice cream.

116
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,900
Yay!

117
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,180
Woohoo!

118
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,800
Yay!

119
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,700
That's everybody!

120
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,100
Oh my gosh.

121
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,080
This game.

122
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,520
Time to go to a first moon.

123
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait, you have Mountain Dew!

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,980
As your...

125
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,460
Oh my gosh, yeah!

126
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,800
Your stuff is Mountain Dew.

127
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,300
Naki!

128
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,980
What is it called?

129
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,980
The backpack.

130
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,580
The true gamer.

131
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,520
Oh!

132
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,500
The power of a gamer Jewish!

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,200
Woohoo!

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,440
Woohoo!

135
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,760
So...

136
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm scared of the mods we have in here.

137
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,780
I don't know what everything we've got.

138
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,920
We need her.

139
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,760
We love you.

140
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,780
There's also a big game update that I don't know anything about.

141
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,300
Yeah!

142
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,720
The game was just updated.

143
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,560
It's kind of crazy.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,800
Yeah, actually some mods broke from it.

145
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,300
Maybe it's for later content.

146
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,680
We were gonna try and have a...

147
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,980
Maybe it's for the harder mode.

148
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,100
Yeah.

149
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,720
We were gonna do a Minecraft mod, but it doesn't work.

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,440
Yeah, the Minecraft world.

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,480
So sad.

152
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,840
It's okay though.

153
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,060
Yeah, new monsters I think.

154
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,280
I don't know anything about the new monsters, but that's okay.

155
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
I'm scared guys.

156
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,160
How do I...

157
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,580
I shouldn't be on the computer.

158
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,480
I don't know what I'm doing.

159
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,180
I don't know what I'm doing either.

160
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,640
What moon do you wanna go to?

161
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,680
Anything!

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,120
The first one.

163
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,860
Yeah, maybe the first one.

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,660
Experimentation?

165
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,040
I don't know.

166
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,540
I think that's the first one.

167
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,220
Yeah, experimentation.

168
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Ayla, do you know how to play?

169
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,440
Do you know what we're doing?

170
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
Yeah, I have an idea.

171
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,100
I equip myself with basic knowledge.

172
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,660
Oh, she's got the knowledge.

173
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,280
Watch her.

175
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,860
100 lethal company tips.

176
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,520
Guys,

177
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,760
I just didn't want to be carried.

178
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,760
I don't want to hold you guys back.

179
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,740
So I...

180
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,100
I watched the 100 tips.

181
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,360
Oh, sorry.

182
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,580
Oh my gosh!

183
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,660
I tried to clap!

184
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,560
I tried to clap!

185
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,760
Wait, Naoki, how did you know?

186
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,120
How did you know?

187
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,180
I watched it too.

189
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,380
Wait, you guys are probably...

190
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,520
I watched Monster Deep Dive video.

191
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,560
Like, I don't know.

192
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,540
Explaining AI.

193
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,960
You're probably more professional than me.

194
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,620
Yeah.

195
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,220
I don't know.

196
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,160
I know it in theory.

197
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,340
I don't know how it works in practice.

198
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,600
Theory?

199
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,120
Great.

200
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,520
I have some mechanics too, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.

201
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,840
Oh, really?

202
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,700
There's like one mod.

204
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah, the present!

205
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,380
Oh, the present.

206
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,760
That's right.

207
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,940
You guys ready?

208
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,120
Naoki, you take care of it.

209
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,140
Let's go!

210
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
Let's pull the lever.

211
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,060
Naoki, you wanna pull it?

212
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,780
Pull it.

213
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Pull it.

214
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,960
Pull it.

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Pull it.

216
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
Pull it.

217
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
Why can't I even touch it?

218
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,760
Let's go!

219
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,260
Oh, actually, I don't know if we can pull it.

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,960
I can't.

221
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,460
Oh, really?

222
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,900
Oh, yeah, there's no option.

223
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,320
My bad.

224
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,620
Maybe it's just you, Emily.

225
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,020
It has to be me.

226
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,360
I need the trigger.

227
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,540
Whoopsie.

228
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,000
Whoopsie.

229
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Then everything breaks.

230
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,200
Whoopsie.

231
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,040
What's going on?

232
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,700
There we go.

233
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,560
Oh!

234
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,240
Oh, shoot!

235
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,720
We're here!

236
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Oh my god!

237
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,200
Oh, yeah, you're supposed to scan things.

238
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,680
Hey, guys.

239
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,880
Show me where the ship is.

240
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,060
In case you wanna come back.

241
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Yeah, in case I get lost.

242
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,180
Yeah, come up here.

243
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,440
Up here, up here, up here.

244
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,080
Alright.

245
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:34,680
Oh!

246
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,380
Wow!

247
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,140
Here we go!

248
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,900
Oh!

249
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,860
Oh, it's dark.

250
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,190
It's dark.

251
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,250
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

252
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,390
Wait!

253
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,030
Wait, wait, wait, where'd you guys go?

254
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,770
Where are they?

255
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,420
It's a ceiling.

256
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,860
It'll come down from the ceiling.

257
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,780
It's far away from us anyway.

258
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,140
Are you sure?

259
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Are you sure?

260
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,000
It won't hit us.

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,200
Yeah.

262
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,520
Wait, it's far away.

263
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,680
I don't know about that.

264
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,100
Naki!

265
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,520
Oh my god!

266
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,440
Ayla, you said it was far away.

267
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,040
We gotta go back!

268
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,060
We gotta go back!

269
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,760
We gotta go back!

270
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,100
I have her body!

271
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,620
I have her body!

272
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,560
Do we have anything?

273
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,200
We don't have anything.

274
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,000
We have her...

275
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,120
Naki died too!

276
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,240
You have to get her body!

277
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,840
You have to retrieve her body!

278
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,640
Okay, um, hold on.

279
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,360
How do I pick it up?

280
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,060
How do I pick it up?

281
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,420
Eh, eh, eh!

282
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,180
I'm trucking

283
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,140
you up, Naki!

284
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm sorry!

285
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,100
No!

286
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,920
Wait, wait, wait!

287
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,720
Wait, wait, wait!

288
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,540
I'll come over there!

289
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,200
We gotta put back Cori's body first!

290
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:35,840
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,440
Oh, I can grab her body.

292
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,520
You wanna try and get Naki's and I take Emonie?

293
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,360
Alright, sure, sure.

294
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Ayla, how do I grab the body?

295
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,400
Sorry!

296
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,260
I can't wait for me here!

297
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:47,860
Okay!

298
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,540
Okay.

299
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,000
It's fine.

300
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,340
She knows the way back.

301
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,080
Emonie, what happened?

302
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Emonie!

303
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,260
Emonie!

304
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,500
Emonie!

305
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,800
One second, guys.

306
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,780
Okay.

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,070
It would have been better if I died first.

308
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:28,850
What?

309
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,470
What do you mean?

310
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,410
I couldn't get her body.

311
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,610
Wait, I wonder what's wrong.

312
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,930
Maybe it's kinda bugged.

313
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,350
Yeah.

314
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:36,910
It's okay.

315
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,210
Let's just go grab a couple things and then we can leave.

316
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,430
Okay.

317
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:40,950
Okay.

318
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:41,950
Don't die.

319
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,730
Don't die.

320
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,030
Don't die.

321
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,390
We got this.

322
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,110
We'll go the other way.

323
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,050
We'll go the other way.

324
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,130
The other way.

325
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,370
Alright.

326
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:47,750
Yeah.

327
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,630
Okay, here we go.

328
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,010
Okay.

329
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:52,530
This way?

330
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,170
Wait, who is this?

331
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,010
Wait.

332
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,950
No, that's Emory!

333
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,270
Wait, you left her body?

334
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:57,830
No, no!

335
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,810
I took her to the ship!

336
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:00,730
Wait!

337
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,050
Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,430
What?

339
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,030
We can get Naki's body?

340
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,830
Oh my god!

341
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,750
What are we gonna do with this?

342
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,490
I don't know!

343
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,690
Wait, why do we have two of them?

344
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,610
Infinite money hack, maybe?

345
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,270
Here, I'm gonna... Let's go check over here real quick and I'll see if there's any items.

346
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,970
Alright, Emory, stay there.

347
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,930
Where are you?

348
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,750
Oh, there's nothing here.

349
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,610
It's empty, completely.

350
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,590
Nothing we can grab?

351
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:33,870
No.

352
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,290
Always just keep clicking right click.

353
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,690
Oh, body of Emory.

354
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:40,850
What?

355
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,530
Wait, why is it red?

356
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:45,990
Oh, yeah.

357
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,850
It wasn't her thing.

358
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,070
Oh, it's green.

359
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,130
It's still the same.

360
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,070
The trap is over here.

361
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,610
Oh, here's a... I got a thingy.

362
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,230
We're good?

363
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,050
We gotta follow you.

364
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,510
Okay, grab Emory.

365
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,290
Oh, Emory.

366
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,510
Let's grab her.

367
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,340
There we go.

368
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:10,740
There we go.

369
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,460
Time to go back.

370
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,980
We got one thing.

371
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,120
So far.

372
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,540
We got two things.

373
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,440
We got an extra body.

374
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,880
We got an extra body.

375
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,820
You know, I wonder if we go back if she'll still be there again.

376
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,900
Oh, right, right.

377
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,340
We gotta check.

378
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,980
Run, run, run, run.

379
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,500
Unlimited Emory works.

380
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,580
Where did you place her body?

381
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,600
In here.

382
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,200
What?

383
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,760
Pause.

384
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,180
I'm not crazy, you guys.

385
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,660
I'm not crazy, you guys.

386
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,100
I'm not crazy.

387
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,680
Are you sure you got her body the first time?

388
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,520
I was holding her the whole time, Isla.

389
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,320
I was holding her the whole time.

390
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,260
I promise.

391
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,020
It was in my hands.

392
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,140
My chat.

393
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,780
It's okay.

394
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,840
It wasn't your fault.

395
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,660
Isla, no.

396
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,420
You believed me, right?

397
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,640
Yeah.

398
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,260
She was right here.

399
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,700
Come on.

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,640
Also, I wonder...

401
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,300
This isn't picking up that I grabbed it.

402
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:15,900
This isn't picking up that I grabbed it.

403
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,700
It usually goes ding.

404
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,440
Maybe it's because of the mod?

405
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,320
Maybe.

406
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,380
Should we just go?

407
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,240
It's almost five.

408
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,360
You wanna try one more thing?

409
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,860
Try and get a little bit more stuff.

410
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,620
Try and get a little bit more stuff.

411
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,260
Okay.

412
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,120
I want more.

413
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,040
More stuff?

414
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,740
Yeah.

415
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,060
I think we need the money.

416
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,780
We're gonna have to run.

417
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,660
Let's go.

418
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,520
We might all die.

419
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Oh, no, no, no.

420
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm gonna be the first one for sure.

421
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,600
It's gonna go back.

422
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah?

423
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,800
Yeah.

424
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:00,900
Yeah.

425
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,340
Okay.

426
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,460
Oh, wait.

427
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,680
It says near activity detected.

428
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,120
I think there's a monster right there.

429
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,120
I'll check.

430
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,380
I don't remember this song.

431
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,480
What just happened?

432
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:24,770
Oopsie.

433
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,370
It was camping.

434
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,630
It was camping.

435
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,170
That's so unfair.

436
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,230
Oh, my gosh.

437
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,070
Unfortunate.

438
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,570
Unfortunate.

439
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,570
Unfortunate.

440
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,930
I'm the lady here.

441
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,390
Let's go.

442
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,790
Yeah, practice run, guys.

443
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,310
We're fine.

444
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,790
The quota's only like a hundred dollars.

445
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,950
Yeah, it's okay.

446
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,510
We got this.

447
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,590
Yeah, we got this.

448
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,190
Yeah.

449
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,530
Oh, sorry.

450
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,730
I died so fast.

451
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,750
I don't know what was going on with the bodies.

452
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,250
Wait.

453
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,730
From...

454
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,310
Yeah.

455
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,050
From your screen.

456
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,050
Was I holding you?

457
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,490
Yeah.

458
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,310
I was?

459
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:07,810
Yeah.

460
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,510
What?

461
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,410
That's so weird.

462
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,290
Someone in my chat said I might have the Gaslight mod installed, but I don't remember installing that.

463
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,670
The Gaslight mod?

464
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,910
I don't know.

465
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,990
Gaslight girl boss mod.

466
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,690
Yeah.

467
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,790
Yeah.

468
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,470
Party.

469
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,830
This is so good.

470
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,010
Oh, yeah.

471
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,950
Woohoo.

472
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,970
Oh, yeah.

473
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,590
Let's go.

474
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,450
That was how fast everyone died.

475
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,610
The minion greedy.

476
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,070
The minion greedy.

477
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,410
Okay, we could do Assurance.

478
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,030
Maybe.

479
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,790
Is that the second map?

480
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:50,790
Yeah.

481
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,830
Let's try it.

482
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,770
Okay.

483
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,870
Yeah.

484
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,250
Here we go.

485
00:20:59,170 --> 00:20:59,690
Woohoo.

486
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,610
Woohoo.

487
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,350
Let's-a-go.

488
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,710
Okay, at least we got white before we got like a bunch of blue.

489
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,050
Sneak.

490
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,490
I don't know where I'm stacking up.

491
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,150
I'm not racking the money.

492
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,430
What if it's this mod breaking the game?

493
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,710
No way.

494
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,750
I'm not racking the money.

495
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,250
Oh, yeah.

496
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,830
I forgot to pass this.

497
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,970
Worse, I think.

498
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,050
Here we go.

499
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,550
Let's go.

500
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,170
I love when they walk in place.

501
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,110
All right.

502
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,210
Everyone here?

503
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,850
Yeah.

504
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:44,890
Okay.

505
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,390
Let's go.

506
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,210
Wait, I don't remember how to get to the...

507
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,910
What's the entrance?

508
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,110
I think it's...

509
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,030
I think it's this way.

510
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,210
Okay.

511
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,530
Follow Emily.

512
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,530
Oh, wait.

513
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,170
I think you're right.

514
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,050
Oh, no.

515
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,630
I don't know.

516
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,410
This way.

517
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,470
What was that?

518
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,650
It was a...

519
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:15,210
What is that?

520
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,580
It's a snake.

521
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,920
I think he likes you.

522
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,140
Really?

523
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,500
He likes you?

524
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,760
Oh, you can join in.

525
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,320
What is this?

526
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,400
It's so cute.

527
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,060
It's kind of fashionable.

528
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,740
Is he loving your eyesight or...

529
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,380
Sometimes.

530
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,500
Sometimes.

531
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,160
Friend?

532
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,780
Okay.

533
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,280
He's my friend now.

534
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,840
I think it's a friend.

535
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,920
As long as he's not killing you.

536
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,040
I'm gonna name him Henry.

537
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,360
What was that?

538
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,110
Henry.

539
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,170
It's on me.

540
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,770
Oh, there's a bee.

541
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,610
Oh, no.

542
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,990
There's so many Henrys.

543
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,470
Oh, my gosh.

544
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,670
Oh, my gosh.

545
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,650
They're called Henrys?

546
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,890
Oh, I just named him.

547
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,710
Wait.

548
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:21,890
Wait.

549
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,110
Each have a Henrys now.

550
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,570
Yeah.

551
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,270
Wait.

552
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,450
I have one?

553
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,250
Wait.

554
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,830
I think I'm flying.

555
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,630
Guys, drive away.

556
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,690
Guys, I think I need help.

557
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,210
I think I need help.

558
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,250
Wait.

559
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,330
You have two.

560
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,070
Luigi.

561
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,790
Yeah, you have two of them.

562
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,370
There she goes.

563
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,070
Luigi, come on.

564
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,250
Come back.

565
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,650
Luigi.

566
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,650
This is so fun.

567
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:54,650
Wait.

568
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,430
How do we get inside?

569
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,310
Is it this way?

570
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,870
I think it's this way.

571
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,030
If I could actually control, you know.

572
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:00,690
This way?

573
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,190
Yeah, this way.

574
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,050
Oh, there's something.

575
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,830
These birds.

576
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,090
Oh, wait.

577
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,290
How do we get up?

578
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,370
Is it this way?

579
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,710
I think this way.

580
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,550
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:12,810
This way.

582
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,070
This way.

583
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,310
This way.

584
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,890
I wanna fly.

585
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:15,870
Whoa.

586
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,150
Oh, here it is.

587
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:18,810
Oh, here it is.

588
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,290
Here it is.

589
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,690
I don't know what I'm doing either.

590
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,770
Will he come inside with me?

591
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,750
I don't know.

592
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,150
Let's test it.

593
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,490
Will he?

594
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,630
Oh.

595
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:35,970
Is he inside?

596
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,450
Oh, he's inside with me.

597
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,490
Yeah, he is inside.

598
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:38,590
Oh, he's inside.

599
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,450
Oh.

600
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,830
Oh, there's an engine.

601
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,310
Let's wait.

602
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,830
Shall we go?

603
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,370
Oh, there's an engine up there.

604
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,730
Yeah, there's an engine.

605
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,530
Oh, I got a cookie mold.

606
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,970
Oh, my hands are full already.

607
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,390
I got free red.

608
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,990
I got free red.

609
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,190
Look how cute she is.

610
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,670
They are collectible.

611
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,430
Oh, my gosh.

612
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,290
I got free red.

613
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,890
She's green.

614
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,170
She's so cute.

615
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,550
Oh, my gosh.

616
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,690
I love the little sound effect.

617
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,210
Best mod ever.

618
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,910
Let's go.

619
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,330
I'm gonna go look for this outside.

620
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,110
Okay.

621
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,730
Check upstairs.

622
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,350
Anything?

623
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,110
Oh.

624
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,310
Oh, there's more cookie.

625
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,170
Easter.

626
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,910
Okay, I'm full.

627
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,810
La la la.

628
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,630
I need to watch that.

629
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,370
Yeah, it's so good.

630
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,710
There's a cat.

631
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,690
Is there something down there?

632
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,850
There's what?

633
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,270
Oh.

634
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,610
He left me.

635
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,880
Oh, there's a cat.

636
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,780
Oh, my gosh.

637
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,320
There's just a cat in there.

638
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,820
Let's go.

639
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,440
Oh, my gosh.

640
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
Does he have a name?

641
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,520
Oh, he's so cute.

642
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,160
Oh, he can pet the cat.

643
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:09,860
Cute.

644
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
You can pet him.

645
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,180
Yeah, let's take him back.

646
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,680
Yeah, let's take him home.

647
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,680
Let's take him home.

648
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,180
Alright, here we go.

649
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,980
My hands are full.

650
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

651
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,600
How do we get home?

652
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,700
How do I use this?

653
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,500
Oh, my gosh.

654
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,200
Okay, jump.

655
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,520
Alright.

656
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,540
I just hear the cat meowing.

657
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,200
It's so cute.

658
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,540
Oh, it's a Kirby.

659
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,620
Oh, sorry.

660
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,340
That was Naki.

661
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:41,800
Never mind.

662
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,040
I'm the Minion.

663
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,660
Is it this way?

664
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,740
I think it's this way.

665
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,560
I'm scanning.

666
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,520
Scanning?

667
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,180
ABS.

668
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Always be scanning.

669
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,280
Oh, it's there.

670
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,800
I hope Naki's okay.

671
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,020
I thought I saw her come out.

672
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,460
Oh, my gosh.

673
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,860
There's a bee.

674
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,100
Birds.

675
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,600
Birds.

676
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,760
Is there actually a beehive here?

677
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,280
No.

678
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,700
There's not a beehive.

679
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,320
ABS.

680
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,260
Always be silly.

681
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,140
Always be silly.

682
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,800
Always be silly.

683
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,100
Loot.

684
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,480
Yay.

685
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,120
Free run.

686
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,560
Free run.

687
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,840
Oh, my gosh.

688
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,580
Oh, my gosh.

689
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,700
I don't know what happened.

690
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,900
What happened?

691
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,280
What happened?

692
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,920
We had a bit of a...

693
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,420
There was like a little confetti explosion.

694
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,020
Incident.

695
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,660
The cat.

696
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,280
Oh, my gosh.

697
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm gonna take him.

698
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,420
Good kitty.

699
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,660
Wait, how do I flip?

700
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,140
Oh, I pet the cat.

701
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,320
Oh, yeah.

702
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,200
We should go check on Naki.

703
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,260
Pet the cat.

704
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,340
Aw, good kitty.

705
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,660
Okay, let's go.

706
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,480
What's the cat's name?

707
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,520
It should say when we scan, but I can't see.

708
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,780
I think his name is just cat.

709
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,960
It's not around the area.

710
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,900
Oh, it's kitty.

711
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,520
It's kitty.

712
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,980
Alright, here we go.

713
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,800
I will look for Naki.

714
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,360
Yeah, let's go.

715
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,260
Yeah, yeah.

716
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,700
Uh-oh.

717
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,280
It's 5 PM.

718
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,160
I think that was a worm.

719
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,020
Wasn't that a worm?

720
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,540
Oh, I don't like worms.

721
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,060
Uh-oh.

722
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,180
Maybe not.

723
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,780
Okay, I don't have anything.

724
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,900
She's back.

725
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,320
Oh, okay.

726
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,720
Good, good, good.

727
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,420
She's alive.

728
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,300
She's alive.

729
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,680
I didn't find anything.

730
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,580
It's okay.

731
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,080
The raccoon was keeping its eyes on me.

732
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,940
You had the raccoon?

733
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,240
The Freeland Blushie is so cute.

734
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,960
Isn't it cute?

735
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,040
Yeah.

736
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,220
Be a worm for you, girl.

737
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,840
Be a worm for you, girl.

738
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,500
Yeah, wanna go?

739
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,840
Yeah, we can go.

740
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,680
Alright, let's go.

741
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,400
Let's go before we die.

742
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,800
Let's go before we die.

743
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,100
Wait, I forgot to select the...

744
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,440
I did see the skin lock.

745
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,380
Or moon.

746
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,040
I was hearing you guys' voices in there.

747
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,240
You heard us, but we weren't in there?

748
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,340
Yeah.

749
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,640
That's so scary.

750
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,800
I thought you came back, but no.

751
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,300
That was probably the raccoon imitating you.

752
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,380
That's so scary.

753
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,800
Oh, was the skin locker doing its thing?

754
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,340
Yeah, I think so.

755
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
Yeah, I think it's imitating your voice.

756
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,780
Eww.

757
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,960
Eww, eww, eww.

758
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,960
Alright, let's go get some new stuff, baby.

759
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,400
Alright.

760
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,600
Yeah.

761
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,680
Did I do this right?

762
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,220
I don't wanna sell Freeland.

763
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,180
Oh, yeah.

764
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,660
Hmm.

765
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,480
We need to pick a new moon.

766
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,720
Yeah, we need to get more stuff so we can keep Freeland.

767
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,220
Yeah, we gotta get lots of stuff so we can keep Freeland.

768
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
Yeah, we gotta get lots of stuff so we can keep Freeland.

769
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,680
Do you wanna go with Adamant?

770
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,560
No, I can hear.

771
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh, the cat is here.

772
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,260
Yeah, pick whatever.

773
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,480
Okay.

774
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,800
Cookies.

775
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,640
Okay.

776
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,300
Pet that cat.

777
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,600
Oh my god.

778
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,440
The way you have to flip him over so much.

779
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,580
Yeah, sit in the corner, cat.

780
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,460
Sit in the corner.

781
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,960
Yeah, sit in the corner, cat.

782
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Sit in the corner.

783
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,200
Yeah, sit in the corner, cat.

784
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,480
Sit in the corner.

785
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,560
Sit in the corner.

786
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,860
Aww, he's so cute.

787
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah.

788
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,860
You can buy cat food for him, right?

789
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,880
I'm not sure what cat food.

790
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,480
Oh, yeah, you can.

791
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:39,740
You can.

792
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,140
Really?

793
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,700
I forgot about shopping.

794
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,200
Nah, we don't need flip.

795
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,680
Oh, we don't have money yet though, right?

796
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,820
Yeah, I don't think we have money.

797
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,580
Oh, yeah, we don't.

798
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,380
We only have 20.

799
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,040
So, we might be able to buy cat food.

800
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,500
Let me check.

801
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,800
Cat food 5.

802
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,800
Do we have 5?

803
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,800
Yeah, we have 20.

804
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,960
Buy cat food!

805
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,320
Yeah!

806
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,380
Okay, I'm gonna buy one.

807
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,460
Try emoting with the cat.

808
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,300
Okay.

809
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,940
Am I emoting?

810
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,320
No.

811
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,260
It doesn't work, I think.

812
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,100
Oh!

813
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,160
Yay!

814
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,180
Yay!

815
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,580
It's working!

816
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,020
It's working!

817
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,560
My son, ever again.

818
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,660
Wait, what am I doing?

819
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,920
Yay!

820
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,640
Oh, come here.

821
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,500
Oh.

822
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,900
Here, I'll get you.

823
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,500
There.

824
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,640
Look, we may be broke, but we need cat food.

825
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,560
Did you buy it?

826
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,500
Yeah, I did.

827
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,500
How much was it?

828
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,640
Um, it was 5.

829
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,360
Okay, so let's land and then we can grab it.

830
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,640
Yeah.

831
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,560
So good.

832
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,340
So good.

833
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,360
Ice cream machine.

834
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,740
Meow.

835
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,240
Let's go, baby.

836
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,000
Where is this?

837
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,400
Alright.

838
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:09,960
Oh!

839
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,880
I've never...

840
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,480
I've never been here before.

841
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,660
Oh, is this new?

842
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,300
I think this is a new one.

843
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,620
Really?

844
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,640
Oh, semantical.

845
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,460
Oh.

846
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,700
Come on up.

847
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,560
Is this the bridge that...

848
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,780
Yeah, I don't know.

849
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,740
I don't think so.

850
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,900
Yeah, we gotta get the ice cream.

851
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,880
Where's the drop, though?

852
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,120
I don't know.

853
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,460
It's just in the air.

854
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,660
You have to wait like an hour for it, I think.

855
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,360
Watch out for the lake.

856
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,820
Oh, there it is.

857
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,580
Oh, I hear it.

858
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,880
Where is it?

859
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,820
This way?

860
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,040
Oh, there it is.

861
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,940
Oh, it's here.

862
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,560
There it is.

863
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,980
Oh, I got it.

864
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,850
Uh-oh, wait.

865
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,670
Uh -oh.

866
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,370
This

867
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:18,730
way.

868
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,230
Yeah, come around.

869
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:24,890
Alright.

870
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,090
Alright.

871
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,450
Gather round.

872
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,310
Gather round.

873
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,190
How do I feed him?

874
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,730
Wait, hold on.

875
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,810
Okay, hold on.

876
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,990
Will he eat it?

877
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,070
Oh, there we go.

878
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,550
Why is he ignoring it?

879
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,330
It's really wet.

880
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,610
Come on, cat.

881
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:51,970
Eat.

882
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,050
Eat.

883
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,550
Eat.

884
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,370
Eat.

885
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,270
Eat.

886
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,010
Wow, this looks very annoying.

887
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,970
Yeah, he's like, why are you trying to force me to eat?

888
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,730
This isn't even my favorite flavor.

889
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,430
Eat.

890
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:10,830
Oh.

891
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,090
I think the audio just like...

892
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,470
It did for me, too.

893
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,830
Maybe it'll be gone.

894
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,690
Maybe he's shy.

895
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,910
It'll be gone when we get back.

896
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,370
Yeah, yeah.

897
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,150
Yeah, yeah.

898
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:25,690
Leave him alone.

899
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:26,410
Alright.

900
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,410
Let's go.

901
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,330
Do you have to go one at a time?

902
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,350
I think so.

903
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,770
I think I heard it crack a little.

904
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,550
I think it's gonna fall.

905
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:39,850
Ah.

906
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,590
It looks a little unstable.

907
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,830
Just like me.

908
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:46,650
Alright.

909
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,910
You go one at a time.

910
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,410
Okay.

911
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,030
Next person.

912
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,510
Next, next.

913
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,490
Next.

914
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,270
Come on over.

915
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,570
Come on over.

916
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,230
I think he can run.

917
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,470
It should be fine.

918
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,170
Yeah, it looks a little unstable.

919
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,150
I think it's okay, though.

920
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,410
There should be an alternative way, though.

921
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,410
Yeah, there has to be somewhere.

922
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:08,770
Yeah.

923
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,710
Loot, loot, loot.

924
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,550
We gotta keep the free Rendall.

925
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,830
Yeah.

926
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,330
Oh, eggbeater.

927
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,170
Eggbeater.

928
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,910
Um, um, um, yes?

929
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,230
Um, um, um, what?

930
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,910
I think that's a thumb for...

931
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,450
What?

932
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:37,770
What?

933
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:37,970
What?

934
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,030
I think it was where we were at.

935
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,350
Let's go the other way.

936
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,690
Yeah, I think we should not go that way.

937
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,950
Wait, wait, wait.

938
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,570
Um, um, why is it getting down there?

939
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:47,970
What?

940
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,410
Maybe it's on another floor.

941
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,510
I think we're okay.

942
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:56,410
Weapons.

943
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,010
The stop sign.

944
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,830
Oh, I just have to...

945
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,270
Hello?

946
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,990
Are you guys alive?

947
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:02,790
Yeah.

948
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,670
Oh, it's just behind me.

949
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,470
Oh my god.

950
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,470
Oh my god.

951
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,450
Oh, stop sign.

952
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,810
Nice.

953
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,570
Wait, we got it.

954
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,230
Let's go this way.

955
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:13,710
Let's go this way.

956
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,530
I think we'll be okay.

957
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,290
I don't have anything.

958
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,990
Yeah, yeah.

959
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,550
I think we'll be fine.

960
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,390
I need to grab something.

961
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,490
Anything in here?

962
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,970
I have empty hands.

963
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,430
It's pretty...

964
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,210
Oh, I think I just saw the thumper go by.

965
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,010
Oh, yes, I just saw him.

966
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,210
I just saw him go by.

967
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,970
So what?

968
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,850
Yeah, the thumper.

969
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,350
That monster?

970
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,450
Oh my god.

971
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,910
Yeah, I think maybe...

972
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,450
I think so.

973
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,750
Maybe we should go.

974
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,730
Yeah, maybe we...

975
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,070
Yeah, it looks impressive.

976
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:51,690
Um...

977
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,710
Oh!

978
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,330
I

979
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,940
think we can go.

980
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,120
Do you feel like seeing the monster in there?

981
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,740
Yeah, we saw him around.

982
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,200
Yeah, yeah.

983
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,240
Maybe we can find the other entrance.

984
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,280
Maybe it's like down here.

985
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,420
There's another entrance?

986
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,820
There usually is.

987
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,900
Fire exit?

988
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,440
Yeah, watch out for the...

989
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,400
Is that the beehive?

990
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,860
Yeah, that's the actual beehive.

991
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,800
Watch out.

992
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,140
Beehive.

993
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,820
Oh...

994
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,540
Um...

995
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,620
Oh, there's another house here.

996
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,660
It's the house?

997
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,080
Oh yeah, let's check that out.

998
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,720
Whoa...

999
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,760
Oh, it's locked.

1000
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,760
I have a key.

1001
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,200
Oh, try it, try it, try it.

1002
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,160
Nice!

1003
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,980
Oh.

1004
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,320
Wait.

1005
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,920
There's nothing here.

1006
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,660
There's art.

1007
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,040
It says something on the wall.

1008
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,400
68 art.

1009
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,060
A profound message.

1010
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,800
I got it.

1011
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,120
Art.

1012
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,240
68...

1013
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,560
Art.

1014
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,540
One away from greatness.

1015
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,680
I know.

1016
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,020
Hmm...

1017
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
Are we going back?

1018
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,580
Or going back in?

1019
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, what is that?

1020
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,100
What is this?

1021
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,920
Oh, those guys are annoying.

1022
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,400
Oh!

1023
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,240
Stay away!

1024
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,800
Stay away!

1025
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,680
Stay away!

1026
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,760
Stay away!

1027
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,140
Oh!

1028
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,020
What are you?

1029
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,740
I think it can't even come down.

1030
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,720
It's probably...

1031
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,980
Oh, I heard the cat.

1032
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,140
Wait, did the cat come all the way over here?

1033
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,300
I don't think so.

1034
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,400
Maybe there's another cat.

1035
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,480
Maybe there's another cat.

1036
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,820
Oh.

1037
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh.

1038
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,400
It's getting dark.

1039
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,660
It is starting to get dark.

1040
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,740
I don't know the way back though.

1041
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,940
I think it's just up here, right?

1042
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,620
Yeah, there it is.

1043
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,240
Right there.

1044
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,500
Oh!

1045
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,860
How do I get up?

1046
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,600
Oh, how do I get up?

1047
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Wait, how do we get up?

1048
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,040
How do I get up?

1049
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,640
How do we get up?

1050
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,400
Go under the bridge.

1051
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:27,640
Yeah.

1052
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,980
Oh, go, go, go!

1053
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:35,300
I think you just gotta yell at them and they go away, right?

1054
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,480
I think you just gotta yell at them and they go away, right?

1055
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,660
Oh, really?

1056
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,760
I think so.

1057
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,220
They don't like noise, right?

1058
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,800
Wait,

1059
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:32,610
was someone alive?

1060
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,330
Was someone alive?

1061
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:37,850
Wait.

1062
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,070
Was someone alive?

1063
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,330
We still have our cat!

1064
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,370
Oh no, they weren't alive.

1065
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,090
Who was I hearing?

1066
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,310
Oh, maybe.

1067
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:50,950
Oh, maybe, yeah.

1068
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,030
Yay!

1069
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,870
Wait, Emily, are you talking?

1070
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,770
I can't hear you.

1071
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,450
Emily?

1072
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,850
Did you accidentally mute?

1073
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,030
Emily?

1074
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,390
Emily?

1075
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,330
We lost the cat, too.

1076
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,490
No, I can hear him!

1077
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,090
I can hear him!

1078
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,890
He's outside.

1079
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:16,690
Cat?

1080
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,050
He got killed?

1081
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:19,750
I thought the cat could die.

1082
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,890
Maybe he's dead.

1083
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,630
Hello?

1084
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:23,650
Hello?

1085
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,350
Okay, my mic cut out for some reason.

1086
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,730
He should be good.

1087
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,230
Yeah, probably something bugged it.

1088
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,050
Do you know how we get to the company?

1089
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,870
Oh, let me see.

1090
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,090
The audio glitch, yeah.

1091
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,690
I thought the cat died.

1092
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,910
I saw blood inside.

1093
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,070
That was my blood.

1094
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,050
That was my blood.

1095
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,530
Wait, where is the cat?

1096
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:49,690
Are

1097
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,730
you sure?

1098
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,970
Are you sure it's not the voices in your head?

1099
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,210
No!

1100
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,270
I promise!

1101
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:00,970
Uh -oh.

1102
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,250
I promise.

1103
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,370
Company.

1104
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,770
Confirmed.

1105
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,890
Company building.

1106
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,670
Time to se- Oh.

1107
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,290
Oh.

1108
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:16,390
Wait.

1109
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,510
Is it Gordy?

1110
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,310
Oh, this is where the company resides, yeah.

1111
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,170
I think we might have lost the cat.

1112
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:22,750
No!

1113
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,550
No, we didn't lose him!

1114
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,730
I promise, he's right outside these doors!

1115
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,590
Cat!

1116
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:28,950
Really?

1117
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,510
Wait, who ate the food?

1118
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,370
Yeah.

1119
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,650
What's food?

1120
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,450
What the heck?

1121
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,650
He's upstairs.

1122
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,550
He's up here.

1123
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,330
They must be really hungry.

1124
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,310
Cat is not here.

1125
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,630
I don't see kitty.

1126
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,070
Anyone?

1127
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:47,910
What?

1128
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,230
I heard him!

1129
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,970
I hear him!

1130
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:53,770
He's somewhere.

1131
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:54,930
See?

1132
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,550
You all need to- You need to take your meds, too!

1133
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,030
It's not just me!

1134
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,010
It's you!

1135
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,770
Take your meds, everybody!

1136
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,290
He's in our wall.

1137
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:07,930
There he is!

1138
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,130
Where is he?

1139
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,710
Where?

1140
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:18,270
Is he inside the- Where is this cat you speak of?

1141
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,510
Did he dip?

1142
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,110
Where's his food?

1143
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,150
Is he invisible?

1144
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,710
A scan.

1145
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,590
Where is he?

1146
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,430
He might be invisible.

1147
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:30,570
Hmm...

1148
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,430
Kitty?

1149
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,590
Where is he?

1150
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,500
I think we're going crazy.

1151
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,120
It's you, Emily!

1152
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,200
It's your cat ears!

1153
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,780
My cat ears!

1154
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,520
You are- You are meowing without knowing that you're doing it.

1155
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,660
Oh my gosh.

1156
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,220
It's a ghost cat.

1157
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,240
It's my cat for real.

1158
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,440
Alright, let's sell.

1159
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,860
Should we keep the free room plushy?

1160
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,980
Oh, the food is gone!

1161
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,580
Wait!

1162
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,760
It's eating the food!

1163
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,840
Who ate the food?

1164
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,340
The biggest mystery.

1165
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,540
Naki, Naki, did you eat the food?

1166
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,740
Did you eat the food?

1167
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,180
No, sorry guys.

1168
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,580
That was me.

1169
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:17,880
It was me.

1170
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,800
I got a little hungry.

1171
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,580
It looks very yummy!

1172
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,300
Why is he eating the food even?

1173
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,760
I wonder if I can sell it.

1174
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,760
Oh, can we sell it?

1175
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,240
Oh, sell the can.

1176
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, sell the can.

1177
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,240
Oh, there's the egg beater too.

1178
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,360
How much does this sell for?

1179
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,120
I don't know.

1180
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,020
Sorry, I uh...

1181
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,440
I scared myself.

1182
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,100
What did he say?

1183
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,760
He said you have been valuable to the company.

1184
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:53,700
Oh.

1185
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh.

1186
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:00,820
I dare you.

1187
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,560
Why is he not getting the item?

1188
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,760
Ah!

1189
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,600
Oh my god.

1190
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,040
How did you live?

1191
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,520
How did you live?

1192
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,600
That spooked me earlier too.

1193
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,800
We still have a cookie sheet?

1194
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,760
Oh, you're right.

1195
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,740
I do have a cookie sheet.

1196
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,240
Oh, okay.

1197
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,260
How much did we sell?

1198
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,660
Good eye.

1199
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,420
Did we reach the quota?

1200
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,040
We have to sell Freeman.

1201
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,900
We don't?

1202
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,620
We can keep Freeman.

1203
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,220
We can keep her.

1204
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,560
Yeah, we reached the quota.

1205
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:35,940
Let's go!

1206
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:36,640
Let's go!

1207
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,860
Good job!

1208
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,320
Just barely.

1209
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,480
Oh my god.

1210
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:40,880
Just barely.

1211
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,420
First day at the company.

1212
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:45,940
Yay!

1213
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,780
Good job, everybody.

1214
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,620
Good job.

1215
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,860
Good job, everybody.

1216
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,980
Good job.

1217
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,780
Good job.

1218
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,520
I don't know where our cat is, but he'll come home.

1219
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,720
Maybe the cat turned into a ghost.

1220
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,220
I think so too, honestly.

1221
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,840
Is that possible?

1222
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,940
I don't see him under here.

1223
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,340
I don't see him under here.

1224
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,740
Wait, I heard him.

1225
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,580
I heard him just now.

1226
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,280
Oh, really?

1227
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,640
Over here.

1228
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,860
Where is he?

1229
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,940
He's up here!

1230
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:15,860
He's up here!

1231
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,660
Oh my god!

1232
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,640
Wait, wait.

1233
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,480
I got him!

1234
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,980
Yay!

1235
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,480
Cat!

1236
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,220
Where are you?

1237
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,820
We saved him!

1238
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,700
Down.

1239
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,880
Oh my god.

1240
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,820
Aww, it's okay, cat.

1241
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
What invisible tree.

1242
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,580
You're safe now.

1243
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,660
Oh my gosh, can you imagine if we left?

1244
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,820
He would've been stuck there.

1245
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,020
Yeah.

1246
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,420
It would've been so sad.

1247
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,740
Maybe we should put him inside here.

1248
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,920
Oh, true, true, true.

1249
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,940
Yeah, put him in there.

1250
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,440
Nice.

1251
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,960
Good, good, good.

1252
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,680
I think that works.

1253
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,520
Yeah, I think so.

1254
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,200
It worked!

1255
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:06,400
It worked!

1256
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,920
Just a cat.

1257
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,880
Put him in there.

1258
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,340
There we go.

1259
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:10,820
Yeah.

1260
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,000
This is humane.

1261
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,920
This is humane.

1262
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,260
Just to keep him safe, you know?

1263
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:19,480
We're just protecting him.

1264
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,220
It is, it is.

1265
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:20,580
Yeah.

1266
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,080
I don't think the computer likes me.

1267
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:26,440
It opened.

1268
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,920
Do we have money?

1269
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,480
We have money!

1270
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,720
We can buy flashlights.

1271
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,740
Money, money, money.

1272
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,240
I don't need flashlights.

1273
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,080
Me neither.

1274
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,840
No, I don't need them.

1275
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,280
We're gonna play with no flashlights.

1276
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,840
I don't need the flashlights.

1277
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,420
At least one.

1278
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,400
Oh, wait!

1279
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,020
We could get a...

1280
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,040
We could get a... what are they called?

1281
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:48,640
Spray paint.

1282
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,080
70% off!

1283
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,300
What a deal!

1284
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,460
Let's go!

1285
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,360
I love stuff on sale.

1286
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,080
Even if I don't need it, I want it.

1287
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:57,840
Yeah!

1288
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,480
Sale, sale, sale, sale.

1289
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:01,760
Okay.

1290
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,360
I'm gonna get spray paint for everyone.

1291
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,180
So we can have fun.

1292
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,300
Oh, no!

1293
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,640
Vandalism!

1294
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,360
Vandalism!

1295
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,500
I'm waiting.

1296
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,080
I'm waiting.

1297
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,700
I know it's coming.

1298
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,700
I think I just heard the cat meow.

1299
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,620
I'm waiting.

1300
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,900
Oh, oh, oh!

1301
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,840
What is that?

1302
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,220
Dropship?

1303
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,040
Oh, oh, oh!

1304
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:41,870
Oh, oh, oh!

1305
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:42,390
Shake can.

1306
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,050
I can't grab it.

1307
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:44,490
Shake it.

1308
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,790
Why can't I grasp it?

1309
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:48,850
Oh, I think I need to crouch.

1310
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,770
There we go.

1311
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,470
You run out.

1312
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:54,850
Come here, Amory.

1313
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,750
Are you throwing at me?

1314
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:00,770
It doesn't work.

1315
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,330
Are you run out of paint or no?

1316
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:02,530
I don't know.

1317
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:03,530
I don't know actually.

1318
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,560
I don't think you remember, but I think the mod lets you...

1319
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,600
If you press T, you can change color.

1320
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,300
And you can press E to erase, I think.

1321
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,420
Yeah, E to erase.

1322
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,400
You have to hold it though.

1323
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,760
E to erase.

1324
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,620
This is the most magical...

1325
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,120
So am I.

1326
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,000
So am I.

1327
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,680
Oh my gosh.

1328
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,700
Ayo could only fit Sam.

1329
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,260
I couldn't fit Sama.

1330
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,680
I could only fit Ayla-Sam.

1331
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,580
Ayla-Sam.

1332
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,600
I think you have to shake it too.

1333
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,160
Oh, shake it.

1334
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,100
Oh my gosh.

1335
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,340
That doesn't look like a child.

1336
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,400
How do you change your color again?

1337
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,340
That doesn't look like a child.

1338
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:51,500
Oh, T.

1339
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:51,940
T.

1340
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,840
Press T.

1341
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,980
Okay, okay, okay.

1342
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,280
Whoa.

1343
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,100
Oh my gosh, E to erase.

1344
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:07,480
Oh my gosh, E to erase.

1345
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,380
This is fun.

1346
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,280
Splatoon.

1347
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,220
Oh my gosh.

1348
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,640
I have to shake my can.

1349
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,840
Maybe I'm not close enough.

1350
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,620
There we go.

1351
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,540
Should I draw you guys?

1352
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,840
Should I shake, shake?

1353
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,540
What should I draw?

1354
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,020
Fool me.

1355
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:35,880
Oh, I know.

1356
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,340
Ready for this?

1357
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,200
Ready for this?

1358
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:59,480
There we go.

1359
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,760
Boring.

1360
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,440
Cute.

1361
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,560
Oh my gosh.

1362
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,180
It's so cute.

1363
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:06,500
Rebel.

1364
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:08,100
Cute.

1365
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,980
Oh, wow.

1366
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,920
My handwriting looks good.

1367
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,740
Rebel.

1368
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,560
Rebel.

1369
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,620
Rebel.

1370
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,100
I'm going to...

1371
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,120
Ayla-Sam is a rebel.

1372
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,460
School.

1373
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,200
School.

1374
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:26,040
Oh.

1375
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,900
Yellow.

1376
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:27,720
Not good.

1377
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,320
Aw.

1378
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,840
I'm out.

1379
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,800
I don't think it's working.

1380
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,240
I think you have to shake it.

1381
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,480
Or you get closer.

1382
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,020
Oh, nice.

1383
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,240
Sucks.

1384
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,000
Size.

1385
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,860
Oh, how do I...

1386
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,020
How do I change the size?

1387
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,040
Um.

1388
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,740
School sucks.

1389
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,480
That's so cute.

1390
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:48,580
Oh, wait.

1391
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,900
Oh, fuck.

1392
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,360
Yeah.

1393
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,320
Oh my gosh.

1394
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,400
Rebel.

1395
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,920
What is that?

1396
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,360
It's supposed to be a...

1397
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,500
It's supposed to be a ghost.

1398
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,520
No.

1399
00:51:59,620 --> 00:51:59,820
No.

1400
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,260
No.

1401
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,300
No.

1402
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,400
Oh.

1403
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:01,960
Emily.

1404
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:02,780
Emily.

1405
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,480
Follow me.

1406
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,100
Follow me.

1407
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:04,320
Emily.

1408
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:04,560
Okay.

1409
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:04,740
Okay.

1410
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,220
Another one.

1411
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:08,940
Oh.

1412
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,220
Why does she spell my name?

1413
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,460
What the heck?

1414
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,000
Is this one having the same personality type though?

1415
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,640
I think so.

1416
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:40,270
Oh.

1417
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:41,250
Key.

1418
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:43,530
Key.

1419
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:44,850
Oh, I don't know.

1420
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,290
Oh no.

1421
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,230
Oh my gosh.

1422
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:47,350
Peepee.

1423
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,070
How...

1424
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,650
Hoger.

1425
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:51,410
Graffiti.

1426
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,010
Graffiti.

1427
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:52,730
Graffiti.

1428
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:53,090
Graffiti.

1429
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,530
Oh, man.

1430
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:57,890
I'm gonna make it worse.

1431
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:58,890
Who wrote this?

1432
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:00,250
Oh.

1433
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,630
I wanted this to be fair.

1434
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,090
It's these.

1435
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:05,490
Yeah.

1436
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,050
Will this still be here when we come back?

1437
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,490
Peepee.

1438
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:07,910
Poopee.

1439
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,710
Peepee.

1440
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:12,110
Poo.

1441
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:12,310
Poo.

1442
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:12,390
Poo.

1443
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:12,990
Poo.

1444
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:13,030
Poo.

1445
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:13,970
Poo.

1446
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:14,270
Poo.

1447
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:14,490
Why you...

1448
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,490
It's spelled from school.

1449
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:16,250
I know.

1450
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:16,850
I hope so.

1451
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,130
Actually, I have nothing else I can draw.

1452
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,650
She has so much power.

1453
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,810
I keep dropping my pen.

1454
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,210
Eyes.

1455
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:27,890
They're staring at you.

1456
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:29,830
Oh my gosh.

1457
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,590
What are you drawing?

1458
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,790
I drew a smiley face.

1459
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,070
He's wearing big glasses.

1460
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,430
Yeah.

1461
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:43,210
He's a nerd.

1462
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:43,670
What a nerd.

1463
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:44,450
Nerd.

1464
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,670
Nerd.

1465
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,210
This looks like a flower.

1466
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,410
What's that?

1467
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,070
That doesn't look right.

1468
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:51,730
I'm gonna erase it.

1469
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,190
Cute.

1470
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,010
Oh, it's so cute.

1471
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:00,870
Oh, shoot.

1472
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,770
Yeah, give it angry brown.

1473
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:06,350
Angry.

1474
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,170
Angry.

1475
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:07,790
Wow.

1476
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,650
He likes vandalism.

1477
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,470
I

1478
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,940
can't reach.

1479
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,380
Too short.

1480
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,060
No.

1481
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,240
This is real vandalism.

1482
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:31,820
Emory.

1483
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,100
Is.

1484
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,340
A.

1485
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,800
I can vandalize this card.

1486
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,540
Oh, my God.

1487
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:44,940
Yeah.

1488
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,600
Nerd.

1489
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,540
Your office looks better now, I think.

1490
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,360
Vandalism.

1491
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,000
Vandalism.

1492
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,880
Someone

1493
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,500
wrote something so mean about you.

1494
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,800
For the company.

1495
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,800
I do the nerd glasses.

1496
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,540
The nerd glasses.

1497
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:16,900
Yeah.

1498
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,020
Yeah.

1499
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,140
Wow.

1500
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,120
This is too long.

1501
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,500
Compo.

1502
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,940
For the company.

1503
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,280
Is the cat still in our locker?

1504
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,220
Yeah, I think the cat's meowing.

1505
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,980
Oh, yeah, he's still in there.

1506
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:35,480
It's all good.

1507
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,340
Emory is a nerd.

1508
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,520
It's a compliment.

1509
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,960
She's bullying me.

1510
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,940
B-Tubers are.

1511
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,540
Are.

1512
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,100
Are.

1513
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,760
Cringe.

1514
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,780
Criminals.

1515
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,120
Cringe.

1516
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,960
No way.

1517
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,760
No.

1518
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,220
Cringe.

1519
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,880
Oh, my God.

1520
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,340
True.

1521
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,800
True.

1522
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,720
So real.

1523
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,360
Still true.

1524
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,440
Still true.

1525
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,880
True.

1526
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,240
True.

1527
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,140
True.

1528
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:12,860
True.

1529
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,540
Still true.

1530
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,940
Still true.

1531
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,060
True.

1532
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,660
True.

1533
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,040
True.

1534
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,080
V-Tubers are cringe.

1535
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,780
V-Tubers are criminals.

1536
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,440
Oh, this is so fun.

1537
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,000
Look at us.

1538
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,660
Look at us go.

1539
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,580
Oh, wow.

1540
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,480
You can even go in here?

1541
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:31,880
Wait.

1542
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,280
He won't get me.

1543
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,880
He can't get me.

1544
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,080
I don't think.

1545
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,820
I can smell the pain.

1546
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,840
I know, right?

1547
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,460
It reeks in here.

1548
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,320
I'm trying to draw the best butt of my life, but I think I made it too pointy.

1549
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:10,700
It's a peach?

1550
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,400
Is that an eggplant?

1551
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:12,720
Yeah.

1552
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,800
Is this a peach?

1553
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,760
Peach?

1554
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,660
And...

1555
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,440
It's like an apple.

1556
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,280
What is she drawing?

1557
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:19,920
What is she cooking?

1558
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,120
Is that a butt?

1559
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:22,740
Yeah.

1560
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,520
It's just...

1561
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,200
Oh, my God.

1562
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,060
Oh, my God.

1563
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,740
Next to the peach.

1564
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,340
On school ground?

1565
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,620
On school ground.

1566
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:31,820
On school ground.

1567
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:31,860
Oh, wow.

1568
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,480
Okay, okay.

1569
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,240
There you go.

1570
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,480
I'm not gonna get fired for this.

1571
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,180
Right?

1572
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,280
No, no, no, no.

1573
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:39,900
They won't know.

1574
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,700
So gorgeous.

1575
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,280
We gotta boost morale.

1576
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,280
Yeah.

1577
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,660
Yeah.

1578
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:55,980
Oh.

1579
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,780
No.

1580
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,420
Oh, no.

1581
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,200
I wasn't right.

1582
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,520
Oh.

1583
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:58,940
Vandalism.

1584
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,380
Oh.

1585
00:57:59,480 --> 00:57:59,680
Oh.

1586
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,440
Have space.

1587
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,080
Never mind.

1588
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,120
Yes.

1589
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,320
Yes.

1590
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,820
Yes.

1591
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,860
Oh, I don't know.

1592
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,700
What were you trying to hunt you?

1593
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,200
Come on, cook.

1594
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,080
No.

1595
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,180
I'm not cooking anymore.

1596
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,340
I'm bad at cooking.

1597
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:16,800
Cooking.

1598
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,100
Yeah.

1599
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,140
She's cooking.

1600
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,720
She's cooking.

1601
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,140
Oh, it's dark here.

1602
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,440
I can't even see what I'm drawing.

1603
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,280
I can see a little.

1604
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:28,680
Yeah, dark.

1605
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,240
I'd try to draw here but...

1606
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,360
Hm, I'll draw here.

1607
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:31,940
Oh, I can't.

1608
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,260
Oh, yeah.

1609
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,280
I can't see this one either.

1610
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,200
Wait, how do I...

1611
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,120
How do you erase it again?

1612
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:36,520
E.

1613
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,200
Hold E and spur.

1614
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,380
E.

1615
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,240
Oh my god.

1616
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,860
Among Us?

1617
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,080
Oh.

1618
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,260
Oh, I thought it was Among Us.

1619
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,480
I thought it was Among Us.

1620
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,860
I thought it was Among Us.

1621
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,620
Here, I'll do it.

1622
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:49,960
Pause.

1623
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:50,480
What?

1624
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,300
It's very cute though.

1625
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:52,540
Oh god, draw it.

1626
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:53,720
Yeah.

1627
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,140
Shush.

1628
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:08,680
Shush.

1629
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,760
Very sus.

1630
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,060
Wow.

1631
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,700
Well, did you guys enjoy the break?

1632
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:21,680
Yeah!

1633
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:23,940
Yeah!

1634
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,380
I hope it all stays when we come back.

1635
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,000
I hope it all stays when we come back.

1636
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,420
Yeah, hope so.

1637
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,420
Where did that Emory go?

1638
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,520
Is she not...

1639
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,160
Wait, where did Emory go?

1640
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:38,860
Where did it go?

1641
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,020
I didn't erase it.

1642
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:40,360
It's fading.

1643
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,340
It's fading away.

1644
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,740
No way!

1645
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,840
Oh my god, it's all gone!

1646
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,100
I'm not a nerd anymore.

1647
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,660
I wanna see it disappear.

1648
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,280
No, no, watch us spray paint dry.

1649
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,220
I was gonna say it's the opposite of watching paint dry.

1650
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,200
It's watching paint disappear.

1651
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,620
Just dry and disappear.

1652
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,240
Yeah.

1653
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,200
Disappear.

1654
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,660
Disappear.

1655
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,660
Performance anxiety.

1656
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,660
Yeah, you gotta appreciate graffiti while you can.

1657
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,500
Yeah, the janitors are so quick here.

1658
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,040
The art.

1659
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,000
Oh!

1660
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:21,740
Oh!

1661
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,220
Oh!

1662
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,700
It disappeared before my very eyes!

1663
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,700
Oh, I think the more you use the spray paint, it will disappear.

1664
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,960
Oh, is that one?

1665
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,120
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

1666
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,060
Oh man.

1667
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:34,800
Wow.

1668
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,780
Is that how it works?

1669
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,400
Oh, there it goes!

1670
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,100
It doesn't even say nerd, it just says erd!

1671
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:41,860
Erd!

1672
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:43,620
Erd!

1673
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,240
There we go.

1674
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:46,920
Nerd.

1675
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:52,990
Nerd!

1676
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:55,790
There we go.

1677
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,290
Oh, no, no, no!

1678
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:01,430
Nerd.

1679
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:03,410
Okay.

1680
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:06,890
Okay, well.

1681
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:07,470
Yes!

1682
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:08,890
There, when we come back.

1683
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,890
Yeah, we'll see you guys.

1684
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:11,410
Alright.

1685
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,050
Are you guys ready for the next mission?

1686
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:15,250
Yes!

1687
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:19,470
She's so cute.

1688
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,190
She's so cute.

1689
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:23,850
Oh!

1690
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:24,410
Oh!

1691
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,990
How did it get so big?

1692
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,370
Oh my gosh.

1693
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,270
We can draw inside.

1694
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:34,890
Whoa!

1695
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,370
This is interior decorating.

1696
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,390
For the company.

1697
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,130
Oh.

1698
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,890
For the company.

1699
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,030
We need some art.

1700
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:47,430
Our cat is green!

1701
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:49,730
Oh, really?

1702
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,110
You painted the cat!

1703
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,050
There

1704
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,440
we go.

1705
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:06,940
Radioactive.

1706
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,520
Radioactive.

1707
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,980
Radioactive cat.

1708
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,040
Let's see.

1709
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:15,840
Yeah, this is...

1710
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,100
This is following safety standards.

1711
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,600
Oh my gosh.

1712
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,840
I'm so like colorful.

1713
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,980
It looks like holographic.

1714
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:24,680
Should we...

1715
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,700
True.

1716
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,700
Go to experimentation.

1717
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,040
Oh, what is there?

1718
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:37,040
There's experimentation, assurance, uh, adamance, rend, dine.

1719
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,180
The rest are like flooded or rainy or foggy.

1720
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,820
Uh, okay.

1721
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,500
We could try experimentation again.

1722
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:45,720
Experimentation?

1723
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,480
Since we died last time.

1724
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:51,820
I don't think we've seen Goku yet, right?

1725
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,660
No, we haven't.

1726
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,780
No Goku, yeah.

1727
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,660
Wait, oh, it must be...

1728
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,940
Oh, we have to leave.

1729
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:01,640
The goal is to meet Goku.

1730
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,720
Goku.

1731
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:03,680
Goku.

1732
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,360
Goku.

1733
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:06,140
Goku.

1734
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:06,860
Goku.

1735
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,520
Must manifest Goku.

1736
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,120
Oh my god, the cat is beautiful.

1737
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,360
The cat is beautiful.

1738
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:12,380
It's beautiful.

1739
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,140
Now we can go, I think.

1740
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:19,860
Hi.

1741
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,140
Did we ever buy flashlights or...

1742
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,040
Oh, no.

1743
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,800
We spent a lot on the spray can.

1744
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,040
Yeah, we're all like, we don't need flashlights.

1745
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,960
We don't need flashlights.

1746
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,420
Here we go.

1747
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,000
Let's go.

1748
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:36,940
Let's go.

1749
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,000
I'm gonna, you know what?

1750
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,580
I'm gonna run around.

1751
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,760
I think the cat is very pretty.

1752
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,300
Nothing will stop me.

1753
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,940
Nothing will stop me.

1754
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,080
Alright.

1755
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,420
We landing?

1756
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,740
Where are we landing, boys?

1757
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,820
What was that?

1758
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,580
Kiss Free Rin good luck.

1759
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,000
Yeah, kiss Free Rin good luck.

1760
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,060
For good luck.

1761
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,020
Yeah, for good luck.

1762
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,000
Bless our journey.

1763
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,200
What?

1764
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,280
Why is it eclipsed?

1765
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,140
An eclipse?

1766
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,500
Oh, I don't like that.

1767
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,020
Close the door.

1768
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,160
I think he's coming closer.

1769
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:38,960
Here, stop.

1770
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,620
It didn't say eclipsed.

1771
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,560
Yeah.

1772
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,800
I think we can go.

1773
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,480
He's on the back.

1774
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,440
He's on the back.

1775
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,300
I think we can go.

1776
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,600
We just gotta be quiet.

1777
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,120
Just be quiet.

1778
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:27,840
Is it

1779
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,100
not faking you out?

1780
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,740
It was cracking me up.

1781
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:02,440
What are you doing?

1782
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,640
Oh my god.

1783
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,360
What was that?

1784
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,620
What was that?

1785
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,180
I heard something.

1786
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,160
What was that?

1787
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:18,860
Nothing.

1788
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,380
It's a little dark.

1789
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,540
Nothing there.

1790
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,500
Watch your step.

1791
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,440
Watch your step.

1792
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,440
Watch your step.

1793
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:38,800
Cannon.

1794
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,200
Is it luminescent?

1795
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:42,860
I guess it's not.

1796
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,380
Are the scrapers working?

1797
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:46,240
No.

1798
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,700
I got some stuff.

1799
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,740
Oh, is that fish?

1800
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,180
Yeah, I got a fish.

1801
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,380
Nice.

1802
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,120
I don't see anything else.

1803
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,280
I don't see anything else.

1804
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:58,680
Me neither.

1805
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,380
I don't see a place to walk, so I guess we go back.

1806
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,000
I don't see a place to walk, so I guess we go back.

1807
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,480
Was that the bracken in the beginning?

1808
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:08,920
Maybe.

1809
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,860
That sound that we heard?

1810
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,920
The bracken should say, hey, it's me, Goku.

1811
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,080
Oh, you're right.

1812
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,720
Hey, it's me, Goku.

1813
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,480
Hey, it's me, Goku.

1814
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,280
It's me, Goku.

1815
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:24,740
There's nothing.

1816
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,860
Oh, there's a flask.

1817
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,600
Oh, opening.

1818
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,460
Grab the flask.

1819
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,940
Oh, can you drink it?

1820
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,080
Sounds kind of wet.

1821
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,480
Oh, god.

1822
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,400
Nope.

1823
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:35,940
Oh.

1824
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:38,500
Door.

1825
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,480
The door sounds scary.

1826
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,780
The door sounds scary.

1827
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:43,980
Calm.

1828
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,300
Oh, it's dead end.

1829
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:49,140
There's not a lot here.

1830
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:49,720
La, la, la.

1831
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,040
La, la.

1832
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,960
I think we gotta go to the other side.

1833
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,180
Yeah.

1834
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,140
To the other side.

1835
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,060
This one is really big, though.

1836
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,460
Oh, it's brighter here.

1837
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,200
Really?

1838
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,420
Goku.

1839
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,200
Goku.

1840
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,400
Oh.

1841
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,540
Another door.

1842
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:15,800
Hello.

1843
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:17,660
Hello.

1844
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:20,320
Oh.

1845
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,900
Oh, steering wheel.

1846
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:24,620
Steering wheel, yeah.

1847
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,500
Nice.

1848
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,820
Oh, there's one more.

1849
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:29,460
More stuff.

1850
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,220
Nice, nice.

1851
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,400
Oh, you got a key?

1852
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,400
No, it's metal sheet.

1853
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,320
Oh, metal sheet.

1854
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,020
Yeah.

1855
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,280
Oh, there's a...

1856
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,700
Well, let's turn it on or off.

1857
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,360
Oh.

1858
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:45,500
Oh.

1859
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:47,760
Oh.

1860
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:48,820
Oh.

1861
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,440
Oh.

1862
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,460
What's supposed to happen?

1863
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,440
I don't know, actually.

1864
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:00,420
Goku.

1865
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,240
I think we're all good here.

1866
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:04,320
Okay, yeah.

1867
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:11,830
You can grab one more item.

1868
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:12,570
Yeah, me too.

1869
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,850
I have enough for one more.

1870
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:16,090
Yeah.

1871
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:16,610
Oh.

1872
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:19,410
Okay, that's the exit right there.

1873
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:21,650
Oh, there's...

1874
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,530
Oh, what's that?

1875
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:26,050
I think that was a...

1876
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:31,470
I don't think that was a friend.

1877
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,750
I don't think that was a friend.

1878
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,210
I don't think that was a friend.

1879
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:35,870
I think it's closed.

1880
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:39,990
Should we...

1881
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:41,750
Yeah, yeah.

1882
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,250
Okay, this is the...

1883
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:48,230
Okay, here we go.

1884
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,870
Remember the dogs.

1885
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,350
Dogs are bad.

1886
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:56,870
Dogs are bad.

1887
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,990
In this game.

1888
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,560
Where's the...

1889
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,320
We just...

1890
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,220
I think he's on the ship.

1891
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:12,260
I think he's on the ship.

1892
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:13,160
Oh, yeah.

1893
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,300
There's a lot.

1894
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,620
There's two of them.

1895
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,800
There's two of them.

1896
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,460
They're on the ship.

1897
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,930
Who are they attacking?

1898
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,440
Save two.

1899
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,500
They're attacking someone.

1900
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,100
I think it's the cat.

1901
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,140
No.

1902
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,180
I think we can go now.

1903
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,180
Oh, yeah.

1904
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,680
Wait, wait, wait.

1905
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,700
It sounded like you.

1906
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,580
It sounded...

1907
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,460
Really?

1908
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,960
Oh, my God.

1909
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:06,940
No.

1910
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,020
No, we lost everything.

1911
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,240
No.

1912
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:11,620
No.

1913
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,400
No.

1914
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:12,880
No.

1915
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,330
I, like, had it.

1916
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:23,450
And then they got me.

1917
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:24,990
Yeah, what the heck.

1918
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,030
So rude.

1919
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,310
I got...

1920
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:30,790
It gave me, like, the Metal Gear, like, death scene, though.

1921
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:31,710
It did, it did.

1922
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:32,710
Really?

1923
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:36,830
Oh, my God.

1924
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:39,630
We already died at the end.

1925
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:40,750
We didn't know that it was...

1926
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,490
It didn't say Eclipse, though, when I picked it.

1927
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:44,110
It didn't.

1928
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:45,370
Change.

1929
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,710
Yeah, the odds were up against us.

1930
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:50,130
Also, I forgot to put my spray can here.

1931
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:52,210
I can't believe you're so shy.

1932
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:52,690
No.

1933
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,870
You can have mine.

1934
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:55,230
It's okay.

1935
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:57,090
You can have mine, too.

1936
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,690
Yeah, yeah.

1937
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,850
It's okay, it's okay.

1938
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:02,450
Okay, now it says Eclipse.

1939
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:03,290
Wow.

1940
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:03,670
Wow.

1941
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,910
It lied to us.

1942
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:06,750
What is Vow?

1943
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,590
It gaslit us.

1944
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,830
Is Vow good to go to?

1945
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,630
We should try a new one.

1946
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,630
Yeah, I'll try Vow.

1947
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,730
As long as it's not a cleric or a bad letter.

1948
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:19,610
Yeah.

1949
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:21,330
Oh, we don't have a lot of money, though.

1950
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:23,250
Uh-oh.

1951
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:25,770
We have no money.

1952
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,970
We can get more money.

1953
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,750
Yeah, we'll just get more money.

1954
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,250
Yeah.

1955
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,690
We lost our cat.

1956
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,970
This is so sad.

1957
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,410
I think there's a lot of cats, though.

1958
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:39,330
We can find another cat.

1959
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:39,870
Yeah.

1960
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,970
I think the cat also killed us, though.

1961
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,290
I think the cat also killed us, though.

1962
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:48,030
I can see the dog charging us.

1963
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,190
Let's land.

1964
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,070
Land.

1965
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,350
Oh, Titan is good for beginners.

1966
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,030
It is?

1967
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:58,570
It is?

1968
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,130
It is good.

1969
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,710
I think they're trolling.

1970
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,610
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1971
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,170
Yeah, you go moonwalking, Luigi.

1972
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,150
You go moonwalking, Luigi.

1973
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:11,730
Moonwalk?

1974
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:13,210
Yeah, this is normal.

1975
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:14,290
This is normal.

1976
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:16,630
Titan easy?

1977
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,610
It should be safer.

1978
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,270
Wait, is it this way, right?

1979
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:24,710
This way?

1980
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:26,730
Is this a new map?

1981
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,170
This is old.

1982
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,130
This one?

1983
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:32,770
Yeah, I think this one is old.

1984
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,510
Don't follow me.

1985
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,150
I don't know where...

1986
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:36,510
I'm lost.

1987
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,490
Oh, wait.

1988
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:40,350
I don't know where I'm going.

1989
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,870
I found it.

1990
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:42,870
You found it?

1991
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:43,230
Yeah.

1992
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:48,510
We have to walk across the bridge.

1993
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:48,690
This is the concrete.

1994
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:50,590
Yeah, this is the concrete one.

1995
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,310
This is the concrete one.

1996
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:52,950
Yeah.

1997
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,390
That's the map.

1998
01:14:59,310 --> 01:14:59,950
That's the map.

1999
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:01,670
It's right here.

2000
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:02,530
Wait, where is it?

2001
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:05,210
Wait a minute.

2002
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:06,370
Where is the door?

2003
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:07,510
It's right here.

2004
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:11,070
When I scan, it doesn't show up.

2005
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,090
Weird.

2006
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:13,610
Ducky.

2007
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:15,610
Ducky.

2008
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:19,570
I'm done.

2009
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:20,830
Ducky, ducky.

2010
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:24,890
I wonder what else there is around.

2011
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:25,530
Nothing here.

2012
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:27,290
Nothing here.

2013
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,870
Nothing here.

2014
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:35,370
Actually, nothing here.

2015
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,250
Mito!

2016
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,230
Hi!

2017
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:39,970
Where are you?

2018
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:41,330
Oh, there you are.

2019
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:42,350
Hello.

2020
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:45,310
There's nothing down there.

2021
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,050
Oh,

2022
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,300
it's the Yippie!

2023
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,060
Yippie!

2024
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:00,700
Yippie!

2025
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,160
Something attacked me.

2026
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:05,360
What?

2027
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,720
It's a Yippie bug!

2028
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,520
It's the Yippie bug.

2029
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:08,700
Yeah, it's the Yippie bug.

2030
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:11,740
Yippie!

2031
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,040
Yippie!

2032
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,760
I love a Yippie bug.

2033
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,080
Actually, I hate the Yippie bug.

2034
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,700
But I love the Yippie.

2035
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,860
Oh, this is also dead end.

2036
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:23,680
Yippie!

2037
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,720
I was like, toilet!

2038
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,400
I was like, I don't remember putting in this Yippie toilet mug.

2039
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,860
I was scared for a second.

2040
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:32,340
Woah!

2041
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,040
Oh, I thought it was a toilet too!

2042
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,120
Woah!

2043
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,700
Oh, I thought it was a toilet too!

2044
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:38,520
Yeah, we have to turn...

2045
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,400
We have to turn it off somewhere.

2046
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,440
Oh, is that it?

2047
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:44,680
No...

2048
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,480
No...

2049
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,040
Ah!

2050
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:49,600
Yippie!

2051
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,260
It's so dark!

2052
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,720
It's so dark!

2053
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:55,200
Yippie!

2054
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,360
Oh, it's really dark!

2055
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:58,100
What?

2056
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,360
No, Yippie!

2057
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,220
Are they okay?

2058
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,540
I think we can go.

2059
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,300
No, Yippie!

2060
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,060
No, Yippie!

2061
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,100
Yippie!

2062
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,040
I

2063
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:21,880
found his nest.

2064
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,780
He won't know that I'm holding on to that, right?

2065
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,600
Where are you?

2066
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:30,700
Ouch!

2067
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,460
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2068
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:34,780
Oh, where am I?

2069
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:36,180
Okay!

2070
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:36,980
You can have it!

2071
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:37,640
You can have it!

2072
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:38,700
Hello?

2073
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:47,760
Really?

2074
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,300
I think that's a...

2075
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:51,940
I think that's a...

2076
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,620
That's a skinwalker.

2077
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,940
That's gotta be a skinwalker.

2078
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:55,300
Yeah.

2079
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:00,840
No!

2080
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,360
Naki's all by herself!

2081
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,060
Naki's all by herself!

2082
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,460
Yippie!

2083
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,040
Uh-oh.

2084
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:15,280
Something?

2085
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,340
She found...

2086
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,340
She found my body!

2087
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,800
Wait, I can finally see myself.

2088
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,240
I've never seen the boss or the big boss.

2089
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:21,780
Wait!

2090
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,260
Naki, I'm right there!

2091
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,780
Naki, notice me!

2092
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:26,380
Naki!

2093
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,000
Uh-oh.

2094
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:27,460
Naki!

2095
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,600
Naki, you're gonna die!

2096
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,180
Naki!

2097
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,480
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no!

2098
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,200
Naki!

2099
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,900
That's a Kraken!

2100
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:35,220
God damn it!

2101
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,040
Why is everyone going at me?

2102
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:38,780
That's crazy!

2103
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:41,680
Uh...

2104
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,800
She's dead and Naki!

2105
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,600
Naki, oh god!

2106
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:45,920
I'm gonna have to go back.

2107
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,780
I'm gonna have to go to the Kraken point.

2108
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,340
Not Goku.

2109
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,160
I wonder if the Goku mod is broken.

2110
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,800
Damn, creatures really love me.

2111
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:54,820
Um, I...

2112
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,820
That's me.

2113
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:56,940
Does she not see me?

2114
01:18:59,460 --> 01:18:59,900
Um...

2115
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,140
Oh my god.

2116
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:01,960
Okay.

2117
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,100
Wait a minute.

2118
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,220
Did we pass it?

2119
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,580
Oh, bring her back.

2120
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,840
Oh my god, I can't tell if that's actually the skinwalker or not.

2121
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:09,920
Okay.

2122
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:11,520
No!

2123
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,440
Wait, actually...

2124
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,520
No, I can't hear their voice.

2125
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:16,880
Yeah.

2126
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,320
Oh!

2127
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,680
Oh, they can't tell either.

2128
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,580
There's so many of you!

2129
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,620
No, no, no, I'm not looking at you.

2130
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,580
Naki!

2131
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:27,920
Naki!

2132
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:29,880
I had your body!

2133
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:30,880
I know, I saw.

2134
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:31,760
Oh, it's locked.

2135
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:32,780
I can use the key though.

2136
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:34,260
Okay.

2137
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,820
You were actually hearing them.

2138
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,840
They were hearing you, but everyone thought it was the skinwalker.

2139
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,140
Really?

2140
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:42,940
Yeah.

2141
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,700
I think so, at least.

2142
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,160
There's a room here.

2143
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,220
I got yippies.

2144
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:48,640
Cookie mold pen.

2145
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,380
Look at those items.

2146
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:51,800
Okay.

2147
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,940
Cookie mold pen.

2148
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,760
I wouldn't have died if I didn't run into so many of the yippie bugs.

2149
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,360
I know, there's so many.

2150
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,700
Oh, there's an item back there.

2151
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,260
Oh!

2152
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,180
We gotta make the jump though.

2153
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:05,380
Oh no.

2154
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,560
Parkour.

2155
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,280
Go ahead.

2156
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,980
I could drop my items and I could try.

2157
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:13,760
Okay.

2158
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,340
But what if you die?

2159
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,140
What if you die?

2160
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,480
That's funny.

2161
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:20,860
Yippie!

2162
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:21,920
I'll go, I'll go.

2163
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:23,940
It's okay.

2164
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:31,780
Parkour.

2165
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,380
Now I just have to make it back.

2166
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,480
Wait, what is on that side?

2167
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,420
Maybe I can jump to you.

2168
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,260
Oh yeah, you can do it.

2169
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,440
Grab the items.

2170
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,240
I don't know.

2171
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,520
Yeah, I feel like I have to.

2172
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:45,980
Parkour.

2173
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,720
Just get on the ledge.

2174
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,260
I think you can just walk onto it.

2175
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:53,000
And then do a dash jump.

2176
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,160
I'm not nervous.

2177
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:54,980
I'm not on there.

2178
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,220
Gamer!

2179
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,880
That was so close.

2180
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,080
It's really dark.

2181
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,780
Can we navigate out of the place we're at?

2182
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,480
No, I don't think so.

2183
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,000
Can we just jump again?

2184
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,040
I don't know.

2185
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,480
I think...

2186
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,500
Oh, there's a plastic fish in here.

2187
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,160
Maybe I can grab that.

2188
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,700
I can grab that.

2189
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,180
Nice.

2190
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,960
Maybe there's a door up there.

2191
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,820
Where did we come from?

2192
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,140
Maybe we should go back that way.

2193
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,980
But I'm too scared to jump again.

2194
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,720
Oh no.

2195
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:38,540
Yeah, okay.

2196
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:38,900
Do it.

2197
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:39,740
Do it.

2198
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:40,800
Do it.

2199
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Do it.

2200
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:41,660
Do it.

2201
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:44,380
I think your loot is valuable, so I should jump.

2202
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,220
Okay, you can try.

2203
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,820
You're talking as if you're dying already.

2204
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:49,380
I know.

2205
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2206
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,080
Do it.

2207
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:54,980
Do it.

2208
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,380
For the company!

2209
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,940
Oh, nice, nice.

2210
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:00,880
Now it's my turn.

2211
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,500
For the company!

2212
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:07,940
Gamer!

2213
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,640
Yeah, we've got a lot of items.

2214
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,800
I wonder what time it is.

2215
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,620
I feel like...

2216
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,260
Yeah, I think that item is very valuable.

2217
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:17,400
Where did we come from?

2218
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:19,020
Did we come from down or this way?

2219
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:23,480
I don't think there's anything crazy out there.

2220
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,500
I don't think there's anything crazy out there.

2221
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:25,900
I don't think we came from...

2222
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,260
Yeah, we came from down.

2223
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:28,760
Yeah, downstairs.

2224
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:31,920
Here we go.

2225
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:34,360
Oh yeah, we came through here.

2226
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:36,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2227
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,400
We unlocked the door.

2228
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2229
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,660
I found it, I found it.

2230
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,060
Oh, wow, they have a fire exit.

2231
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,900
Wait, is it the real fire exit?

2232
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,500
Oh, it's real, it's real.

2233
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,020
Oh, nice, it's real.

2234
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,080
How do I get back up?

2235
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,080
They got this.

2236
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,480
I can't see the timer.

2237
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:07,300
Me neither.

2238
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:07,980
It doesn't say.

2239
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,380
Oh, it's just a tree.

2240
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,180
No, not that way.

2241
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,160
I'm gonna go the other way.

2242
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,620
I'm gonna go the other way.

2243
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:21,230
There's water.

2244
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,350
Water, water, water.

2245
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,050
Oh, it's flooded.

2246
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:26,770
Oh, up here?

2247
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:27,110
Nevermind.

2248
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,530
Let's go back to the bridge, maybe.

2249
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:32,790
I mean, it looks like a plan, but different colors.

2250
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:33,450
Yeah, yeah.

2251
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,250
Oh, there it is.

2252
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,510
Oh my god.

2253
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:40,270
Do we take the concrete bridge or the...

2254
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:42,210
other one?

2255
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,650
Oh my gosh, it's so dark.

2256
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,230
Let's take the concrete.

2257
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,950
Yeah, yeah, just follow.

2258
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:49,230
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

2259
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,690
I don't see any giants.

2260
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:53,650
I think they're okay.

2261
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:55,030
Okay.

2262
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,710
But it's foggy.

2263
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:58,790
It's really foggy.

2264
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:00,910
Okay, it is foggy.

2265
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,510
Oh boy.

2266
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:05,230
I don't see anything.

2267
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:07,230
I don't know.

2268
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:08,630
It's over here.

2269
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:11,050
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2270
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:12,350
Nice.

2271
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:16,110
Okay.

2272
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:19,230
What?

2273
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:20,210
What?

2274
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:21,430
There's like no monsters.

2275
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:22,390
It's crazy.

2276
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:26,890
Very lucky.

2277
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:28,650
Yeah, super lucky.

2278
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:30,190
Yeah.

2279
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:31,450
Oh, nice.

2280
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:40,170
Since Naki and Mint are here, I think they might not be back.

2281
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:41,630
Yeah, yeah.

2282
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:43,890
Go, go, go.

2283
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:44,870
There's a giant.

2284
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:47,130
It's there.

2285
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:48,530
Yeah, I can hear him walking.

2286
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:50,070
Oh, yeah, okay.

2287
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:53,210
It's late anyway.

2288
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:53,890
We gotta go.

2289
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:56,950
I don't know.

2290
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,910
What the heck?

2291
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,350
Did you see that?

2292
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:02,450
No, I didn't see it.

2293
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,410
Oh, probably was the giant.

2294
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:07,010
Did they die?

2295
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:08,950
Oh, they died.

2296
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:10,350
Amazing.

2297
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,050
That's so bad.

2298
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:19,170
You guys carried.

2299
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:20,650
Guys, it's so good.

2300
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,310
Yeah.

2301
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:23,410
Okay.

2302
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:24,930
Glad we got something.

2303
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:29,070
We both died to the Yippee bug.

2304
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:30,410
Oh, you did?

2305
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,030
Yeah.

2306
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:35,910
Oh, did you know that Skinwalker copied your voice?

2307
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:36,610
It was like, Yippee.

2308
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:37,190
Really?

2309
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:39,670
Yeah, your voice.

2310
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:41,590
Yippee, yippee.

2311
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:42,890
Yippee.

2312
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:45,090
Are we gonna make it to the quarter?

2313
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:46,070
Then increase.

2314
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,250
I think we'll be okay.

2315
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:51,870
One day left.

2316
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:54,330
I'm gonna go to Adamant.

2317
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:55,970
Yeah.

2318
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:59,010
We can sell our spray cans if we need to and stuff.

2319
01:25:59,210 --> 01:25:59,450
Yeah.

2320
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:01,170
Oh, okay.

2321
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:02,170
Alright.

2322
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:04,250
High five, Isla-sama.

2323
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:05,650
High five.

2324
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,610
How do you high five?

2325
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:07,410
I don't know.

2326
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:08,990
We can have point instead.

2327
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:10,690
Yeah, point.

2328
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,810
Clap at you.

2329
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:13,950
Yeah, touch.

2330
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,370
Yeah.

2331
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:17,050
Okay,

2332
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:20,950
I gotta pass this.

2333
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:21,890
Alright, here we go.

2334
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:22,610
Let's go.

2335
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:24,510
Let's go.

2336
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:28,350
I believe it's copying my voice.

2337
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:36,850
I thought I was gonna die from falling.

2338
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:37,710
I'm so glad.

2339
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:38,430
Wait, what?

2340
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:40,470
Oh, are we back?

2341
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,550
Alright.

2342
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:44,390
Let's go.

2343
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:47,090
Where is this?

2344
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:50,350
I think the first time I nailed that jump like back and forth without dying.

2345
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:51,910
I love that thing.

2346
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:55,430
Oh, okay.

2347
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:56,110
What is that?

2348
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:59,730
Oh, I think this...

2349
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:00,810
Ah!

2350
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:00,890
Ah!

2351
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:03,790
It scared me.

2352
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:06,150
It's listening again.

2353
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:08,070
You can fly now.

2354
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,130
Fly me across.

2355
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,450
Nope.

2356
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,000
Come on over.

2357
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,640
The water's fine.

2358
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,200
Nice.

2359
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,580
She's flying around.

2360
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:43,880
Am I actually flying?

2361
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,120
Yeah.

2362
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,680
Oh.

2363
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,720
Here we go.

2364
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,500
Here we go.

2365
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,160
Here we go.

2366
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,060
Oh, I got one too.

2367
01:27:58,180 --> 01:27:59,000
Oh, there's something here.

2368
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,380
Oh, Oh, Oh.

2369
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,940
Oh, they're... It's the guy!

2370
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,620
It's the guy!

2371
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,460
Freddy Fazbear!

2372
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,080
It's Freddy Fazbear!

2373
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,220
Oh my god!

2374
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,620
It's Freddy Fazbear!

2375
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:12,880
Freddy Fazbear!

2376
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:16,940
Freddy Fazbear!

2377
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,640
Oh my god!

2378
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,520
I

2379
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:35,050
like those guys.

2380
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:35,530
They're fun.

2381
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:37,810
We found Freddy!

2382
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:38,350
Oh!

2383
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:38,690
Oh!

2384
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,090
Oh!

2385
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,150
Is that him?

2386
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:41,210
Did someone grab Freddy?

2387
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:56,580
I don't think there's anything else.

2388
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,200
Empty.

2389
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,290
It's just me.

2390
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:18,450
It's just you.

2391
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:20,130
It's Freddy Fazbear.

2392
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:21,910
Freddy Fazbear.

2393
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,650
I got a present!

2394
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:24,530
Gotcha!

2395
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:26,510
Wait!

2396
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:30,030
Alright!

2397
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:30,750
Gotcha!

2398
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:33,750
Oh!

2399
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:36,170
It's that thing again.

2400
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:37,270
Just hug the wall.

2401
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,870
Be careful.

2402
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:38,830
Yeah.

2403
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:40,430
Oh!

2404
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,050
Be careful.

2405
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:44,850
At least it's light this time.

2406
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:45,410
Hug the wall.

2407
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:47,870
Oh!

2408
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:48,470
Gotcha!

2409
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:51,250
It's copying your voice.

2410
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:53,370
We should open...

2411
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:53,610
Wait.

2412
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:54,130
I don't know.

2413
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:54,490
Maybe...

2414
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:55,090
We should open outside.

2415
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,170
I heard the skinwalker.

2416
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:58,150
I heard the skinwalker.

2417
01:29:58,970 --> 01:29:59,990
Come on.

2418
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:05,870
Alrighty.

2419
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,610
Happy birthday to us!

2420
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:10,150
Happy birthday to us!

2421
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,690
It's a bell!

2422
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:13,630
It's a bell!

2423
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:16,030
Oh nice!

2424
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:16,530
Yeah!

2425
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,510
That's our love.

2426
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:20,350
Let's go.

2427
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,710
I only need an eye.

2428
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,350
Do we bring it back on the ship or...

2429
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:26,470
Yeah.

2430
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:27,730
We can take our stuff back for now.

2431
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:27,950
Yeah.

2432
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:28,890
I think we got a good amount.

2433
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:29,310
Yeah.

2434
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:29,950
Let's go.

2435
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,910
Alright.

2436
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:34,010
Maybe we pass.

2437
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,910
I know.

2438
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,370
Love the airport.

2439
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:40,990
Party hard.

2440
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:41,530
Do you think she's good?

2441
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:43,230
Yeah.

2442
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:51,670
Oh!

2443
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:52,710
It's this thing again.

2444
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:53,810
Oh!

2445
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:53,810
It's this thing again.

2446
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:54,090
Oh!

2447
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:54,350
It's this thing again.

2448
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,730
I hope this doesn't explode.

2449
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,450
I hope this doesn't explode.

2450
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:00,310
Oh!

2451
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:00,910
Thank goodness.

2452
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,510
Okay.

2453
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:05,290
Wait.

2454
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:05,810
Where's Freddy?

2455
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:06,850
Where's Freddy?

2456
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:07,110
Oh!

2457
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:07,870
I don't know where's Freddy.

2458
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:09,550
There we go.

2459
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:09,830
There we go.

2460
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:10,510
Okay.

2461
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:11,350
I think we're good.

2462
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:13,570
Freddy Fazbear is worth how much?

2463
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:15,630
37?

2464
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:16,790
That guy's priceless.

2465
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:18,330
Oh!

2466
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:19,390
Air Hornet 60.

2467
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:19,950
Wow!

2468
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:20,810
336.

2469
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:22,010
I think we're good.

2470
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:23,210
We met the quota.

2471
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:24,230
We did already?

2472
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:24,830
We met the quota.

2473
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:26,670
I think we can go back in though.

2474
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,490
It's still kind of early.

2475
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:27,950
Oh!

2476
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:28,590
Okay.

2477
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:29,150
Sorry.

2478
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:29,450
Sorry.

2479
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:29,550
Sorry.

2480
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:33,910
Bridge.

2481
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,160
Hold on.

2482
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:00,600
I'll try going.

2483
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:13,800
Come here.

2484
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:14,060
Come here.

2485
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:16,480
Oh!

2486
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,420
I took some damage.

2487
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:17,840
Me too.

2488
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,020
I took damage also.

2489
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,300
I think we just gotta...

2490
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:23,220
Yeah.

2491
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,980
I think you just gotta take it.

2492
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:25,220
Yeah.

2493
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,060
Oh!

2494
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:27,560
Oh!

2495
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,060
Oh!

2496
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:28,440
Oh!

2497
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:28,520
Oh!

2498
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,100
Is this a jump?

2499
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:29,200
No!

2500
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:29,320
No!

2501
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:29,420
No!

2502
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:30,360
Shoot!

2503
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:32,820
Shoot!

2504
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,060
Okay.

2505
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,180
You guys okay?

2506
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:38,940
Shoot!

2507
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:39,280
Shoot!

2508
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:39,920
Shoot!

2509
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:40,380
Shoot!

2510
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:40,520
Shoot!

2511
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,800
Get off me!

2512
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:44,560
Okay.

2513
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,720
Let's go back inside before we...

2514
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:47,920
Okay.

2515
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:48,640
Let's go!

2516
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:50,160
No!

2517
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:51,800
Let's go!

2518
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,440
Where did we go earlier?

2519
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:57,920
The window?

2520
01:32:58,100 --> 01:32:58,840
I don't remember.

2521
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,900
Did they die?

2522
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,000
I

2523
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:19,410
think so.

2524
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:20,330
You think they died?

2525
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,190
I think so.

2526
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,290
Let's just go back.

2527
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:26,670
Let's just go back.

2528
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,750
Going back inside was a mistake.

2529
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:29,950
Go away!

2530
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:31,090
Go away!

2531
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:31,950
We're trying to go home!

2532
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:32,550
Ah!

2533
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,360
Let's just get our bridge away from the bridge...

2534
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,840
I think everybody died.

2535
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:14,860
No.

2536
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,100
No.

2537
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:15,760
I think everybody...

2538
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,760
I think everybody died.

2539
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:19,720
No!

2540
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:33,080
Oh my god we shouldn't have going backward.

2541
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:33,860
Pull!

2542
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:37,510
We shouldn't have- No.

2543
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,550
We're Poor.

2544
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:39,350
No.

2545
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:40,750
We're 12.

2546
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:41,510
I think we're fine.

2547
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:41,790
Yeah.

2548
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:42,630
It's only 12.

2549
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,890
We got this affection.

2550
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:48,390
We'll just sell Freddy Fazbear for a guy.

2551
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,990
Yeah, Freddy's worth a lot and so is the bell.

2552
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:53,750
No, the air horns are worth 60, so I think we can...

2553
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:54,550
Yeah, I think we're good.

2554
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:55,390
Yeah, woah!

2555
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:55,790
Really?

2556
01:34:56,450 --> 01:34:57,230
Yeah, yeah.

2557
01:34:57,690 --> 01:34:59,970
We have two air horns, so that's 120 already.

2558
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:01,990
Yeah, we got this.

2559
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:07,050
Are we gonna sell him?

2560
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:09,550
I think so.

2561
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:10,190
I don't know.

2562
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:11,650
We might have to.

2563
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,530
How much is he worth?

2564
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:14,850
31.

2565
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:16,010
I mean...

2566
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,230
31.

2567
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,550
I think we could spare him.

2568
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:20,210
No, we can't.

2569
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:22,670
Air horn has a higher value than Freddy Fazbear.

2570
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:24,530
Freddy Fazbear's worth nothing.

2571
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:25,330
Can we just sell an air horn?

2572
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:27,630
Would Freeman cost more than Freddy?

2573
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:29,050
Yeah, I think so.

2574
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,610
I...

2575
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:30,710
I don't know.

2576
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:33,270
Well, we can check.

2577
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:34,730
Okay.

2578
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:36,270
Save him for last, I guess, maybe.

2579
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:37,410
I never actually got to see...

2580
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:38,090
Yeah, yeah.

2581
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:38,890
...Freddy's value.

2582
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:39,510
What's this?

2583
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:40,450
Okay.

2584
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:44,610
Oh, we don't have a caddy.

2585
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:45,730
Oh, everything's gone.

2586
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,730
We're all over wonderful...

2587
01:35:51,810 --> 01:35:52,850
It's all for you.

2588
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,470
Is that all?

2589
01:35:57,870 --> 01:35:58,670
Oh, I can't.

2590
01:35:59,350 --> 01:35:59,810
Okay.

2591
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:02,890
Oh, watch out, watch out.

2592
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:04,650
Watch out, watch out.

2593
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:04,730
Wow.

2594
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:05,830
Watch out, watch out.

2595
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:07,710
Oh, he didn't come out.

2596
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:08,450
He's hungry.

2597
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:10,690
He'll come.

2598
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:11,290
He's gonna come.

2599
01:36:19,330 --> 01:36:20,370
That was close.

2600
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:24,930
That was... oh, we made quota!

2601
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:27,490
We're good!

2602
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:29,370
We're okay, we're okay.

2603
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:30,130
Yeah.

2604
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:38,530
Maybe this is enough.

2605
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:40,330
Did you hit it?

2606
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,100
Feast.

2607
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:48,760
Feast, my child.

2608
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:51,280
Feast.

2609
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,320
He's nervous.

2610
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,420
There we go.

2611
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,960
I swiped that.

2612
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,100
One swipe.

2613
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,720
Oh, 141.

2614
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:03,680
Nice!

2615
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,560
Oh, the bells.

2616
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:06,580
I think we're pretty rich.

2617
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,900
We can buy stuff.

2618
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:11,180
Oh, we left the rubber ducky here.

2619
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:14,000
It's okay, he's good.

2620
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:14,700
Yeah, you can stay there.

2621
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:15,580
Yeah, you can stay there.

2622
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,840
Throw, flash, come on.

2623
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,300
Oh, you're gonna buy a flashlight?

2624
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,180
Yeah, I could definitely afford them.

2625
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,760
Oh, he's so chicken.

2626
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,480
Oh, how do I... quick terminal.

2627
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:27,380
Okay, there we go.

2628
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,720
Okay, you guys can use it now.

2629
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:29,280
Woo!

2630
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,440
How much we got?

2631
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,160
I think we got 400.

2632
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:34,000
400!

2633
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,240
How many flashlights did you buy, Ayla-sama?

2634
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,980
I only bought one.

2635
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:42,220
Oh, I should have bought forever.

2636
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:43,980
It's okay.

2637
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,520
I don't use them, so...

2638
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,160
I don't use them much, Ayla.

2639
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,200
I'm sorry.

2640
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,100
I'm a chicken.

2641
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:52,540
I'll buy one.

2642
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:53,900
I'm a chicken.

2643
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,100
I'll buy a profile one.

2644
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,340
I'm gonna get it.

2645
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,380
I'm gonna get it.

2646
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,000
I'm gonna get it.

2647
01:37:59,000 --> 01:37:59,500
It's mine.

2648
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:01,600
Oh, take it.

2649
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:04,040
How do I use this?

2650
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:04,320
Oh.

2651
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,080
There you go.

2652
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:06,580
Am I bright?

2653
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:08,100
Yeah.

2654
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,120
I can see your iPad.

2655
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:11,000
Do you have an iPad?

2656
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,900
I have an iPad.

2657
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:13,940
Yeah, you do.

2658
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:20,660
Enter.

2659
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,520
I like your bunny ears.

2660
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,380
Oh, you have bunny ears?

2661
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:26,300
Yeah, you do.

2662
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:28,340
Oh.

2663
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,500
Nice.

2664
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:33,520
Cool.

2665
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,280
Oh, there's one more.

2666
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:36,480
Double!

2667
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:36,580
Double!

2668
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:41,600
Oh, I should have... Yeah, we need like...

2669
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:42,600
Yeah.

2670
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,220
Weapon.

2671
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,060
I don't have a weapon.

2672
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:44,300
I got my flashlight.

2673
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:44,980
A shovel.

2674
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,720
I need a weapon.

2675
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,000
A shovel.

2676
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,180
40% off.

2677
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:56,520
Okay.

2678
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,320
Oh, nice.

2679
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,200
Did you get the flashlight?

2680
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:01,500
There should have been two, I think.

2681
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:02,100
A what?

2682
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,280
There should have been two flashlights.

2683
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:05,840
Did you guys grab them or...

2684
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,900
Because I couldn't find the other one.

2685
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,560
I got mine.

2686
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:09,280
The one I ordered.

2687
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:09,820
Okay, let me go check.

2688
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,080
I didn't see it.

2689
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,900
I didn't see it.

2690
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:16,520
I bought an extra shovel.

2691
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,100
But it already...

2692
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,660
Watch out.

2693
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:19,920
Watch out.

2694
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,320
There it is.

2695
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:22,700
Wow.

2696
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:23,820
There you

2697
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,660
go.

2698
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,420
Order one more.

2699
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:40,420
No.

2700
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,080
One more.

2701
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,040
Wait, what happened?

2702
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:44,680
I couldn't find the...

2703
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:44,720
Door.

2704
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,800
It should have came with the thing.

2705
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,380
With what?

2706
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:51,420
Loud horn.

2707
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:51,940
100.

2708
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:54,300
Translator?

2709
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,980
What do you need a translator for?

2710
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:57,680
You can talk to Goku.

2711
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,460
We need the translator.

2712
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:03,780
Did you find a flashlight?

2713
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,640
I didn't find it.

2714
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,400
Should I buy one?

2715
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:11,820
I'll buy one more.

2716
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,580
Oh.

2717
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,000
And then...

2718
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,180
Is this...

2719
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:15,460
Is this...

2720
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,640
Did you take it?

2721
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:19,520
Four...

2722
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,440
Flashlight.

2723
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:21,740
Wait, wait.

2724
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:22,060
I love it.

2725
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:22,500
We're okay.

2726
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:22,920
We're okay.

2727
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,440
We're okay.

2728
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,060
Oh.

2729
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:24,480
Oh.

2730
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:24,660
Oh.

2731
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:26,360
Minted our...

2732
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,200
Minted our little...

2733
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:27,880
We were buying stuff.

2734
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:28,960
Wait.

2735
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,020
I'm waiting for one more.

2736
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,740
I'm waiting for one more.

2737
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:31,280
Oh my...

2738
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:31,920
There's another...

2739
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,200
Holy...

2740
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:34,800
Okay.

2741
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:35,560
Wow.

2742
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,240
I can do everything.

2743
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,000
Oh.

2744
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,840
Then I'll solve this.

2745
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,400
Did you get another shovel right now?

2746
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,920
So is the gas mine mine.

2747
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,600
Now that's more.

2748
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,080
We are shovel...

2749
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,420
How long did you have it in there for?

2750
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,380
What the flashlight?

2751
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,260
For a long time.

2752
01:40:58,290 --> 01:41:00,370
I'm the yippee bug now.

2753
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:01,090
I'm the yippee.

2754
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:01,690
Yippee!

2755
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,950
You took my loot.

2756
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:05,490
Oh...

2757
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:06,490
Did you...

2758
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:07,270
I got that.

2759
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:07,550
Oh!

2760
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,470
I'm sorry.

2761
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:11,530
Oh, we can heal each other.

2762
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:17,210
You can kill, you can kill, and then you can feed to the demon.

2763
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:21,130
Where are we heading?

2764
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:34,930
What is... Oh, there's Dine!

2765
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:35,870
Can we go there?

2766
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:39,650
What do the numbers mean?

2767
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:42,070
I'm losing it!

2768
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:44,870
She's on my stride!

2769
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:46,930
She's on... Oh my god!

2770
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:48,310
Restrain her!

2771
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,110
Restrain her!

2772
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,190
Oh my gosh!

2773
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:51,250
You hurt me!

2774
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:55,970
I'm sorry.

2775
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:59,090
You need to get a... This is a team-playing game.

2776
01:41:59,510 --> 01:41:59,750
It's okay.

2777
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,190
It's okay.

2778
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:02,070
You need to get yourself together.

2779
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:04,430
We need to work as a team.

2780
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:06,690
I'll stay out of the ship.

2781
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:08,370
Wait, what happens if you guys fly and I stay outside?

2782
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:10,770
This is why company needs super alignment.

2783
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:13,330
Actually... No, I think it's... I think you come back in.

2784
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:14,230
True.

2785
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:15,730
Oh, really?

2786
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:16,570
Let's see.

2787
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:17,150
We can check.

2788
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:19,490
Can we go to Dine?

2789
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:22,510
Oh, it's 600.

2790
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:23,330
Just kidding.

2791
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:28,150
What's Val?

2792
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:30,590
I'm on top of the world.

2793
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:31,470
Oh, okay.

2794
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,610
We're going to Val.

2795
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:33,830
Okay.

2796
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:36,350
Oh, never mind.

2797
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:38,530
We have to start the ship.

2798
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:39,790
Okay, okay.

2799
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:42,530
Let's go.

2800
01:42:44,150 --> 01:42:45,170
I'm outside.

2801
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,890
I can see the ship fly.

2802
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,130
Where are you?

2803
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:52,950
I'm back.

2804
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:53,800
I'm back.

2805
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:54,990
I'm back.

2806
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:56,590
Okay, okay.

2807
01:42:56,750 --> 01:43:00,250
I thought I could see the ship fly from outside, but...

2808
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:02,570
You can if you jump off it entirely, I think.

2809
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:06,950
We got overtime bonus now.

2810
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:07,330
Yippee!

2811
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:10,150
20.

2812
01:43:10,610 --> 01:43:11,050
Okay.

2813
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:11,790
Okay, moons.

2814
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:13,690
Okay, Val.

2815
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:15,110
No problem.

2816
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:17,730
Here we go!

2817
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:23,210
Here we go.

2818
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:27,370
It's good to land.

2819
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:29,730
La la la la.

2820
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:32,330
La la la la.

2821
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:32,810
La la la.

2822
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:35,150
I love when she starts singing.

2823
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:36,730
Oh, I used up a second.

2824
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:37,990
Oh, yeah.

2825
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:38,970
Ah.

2826
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:41,130
There's a moon with a mansion.

2827
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:41,770
That might be fun.

2828
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:44,810
Yeah, I want to go there, but we have to pay a lot of money for it.

2829
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,110
Yeah, we need money.

2830
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:45,870
Oh, there's a big pumpkin.

2831
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:46,870
Is this a pumpkin?

2832
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:47,410
Pumpkin!

2833
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:48,890
Oh, is this a pumpkin?

2834
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,490
Smash the pumpkin!

2835
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:52,450
Smash the pumpkin!

2836
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:54,130
Oh.

2837
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:55,050
Oh, so...

2838
01:43:55,050 --> 01:43:56,730
I didn't know you liked pumpkins that much.

2839
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,090
I don't like pumpkins.

2840
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:59,350
I don't like pumpkins.

2841
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:00,210
Pumpkins are pretty good.

2842
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:01,730
Not that much.

2843
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:04,290
It's pretty good.

2844
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:07,310
I was counting on you for dinner.

2845
01:44:07,570 --> 01:44:07,950
Yeah.

2846
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:08,270
Yeah.

2847
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:08,950
Yeah.

2848
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:09,230
Yeah.

2849
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:12,210
Pumpkin soup for everyone.

2850
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:12,750
Where is it?

2851
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:13,470
Oh, that sounds delicious.

2852
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:13,810
I think it's this way.

2853
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:16,250
Da da da da da da.

2854
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:17,530
Whoa.

2855
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:18,210
Whoa.

2856
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,450
This is...

2857
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:19,570
Oh.

2858
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:20,050
Yep.

2859
01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:22,110
Ah.

2860
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:23,930
There's a beehive.

2861
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:26,150
Ah!

2862
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,980
Here I come.

2863
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:39,340
Watch out.

2864
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:40,240
Hello.

2865
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:40,960
Hello.

2866
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:41,260
Watch out.

2867
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:45,720
Come on.

2868
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:46,900
Over the water.

2869
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:47,680
Look at their arms.

2870
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,920
They're ready to bonk.

2871
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:50,500
Yeah.

2872
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:51,420
Oh.

2873
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:51,980
Come on.

2874
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:52,620
Oh my god.

2875
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:53,900
There's a flying thing.

2876
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:55,060
What's that guy doing?

2877
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:56,420
Whoa.

2878
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,780
He's just spinning.

2879
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,380
That's what he said.

2880
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:01,320
Let's go.

2881
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:02,980
Okay.

2882
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:07,500
We in.

2883
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:08,480
We're in.

2884
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:09,540
Oh, I see something over here.

2885
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:11,060
Oh, I got tea kettle.

2886
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:11,540
Oh.

2887
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:12,700
Kettle.

2888
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:13,020
Oh.

2889
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:13,560
Oh.

2890
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:13,760
Oh.

2891
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:15,200
There's a big room.

2892
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:16,940
Is that something?

2893
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:18,080
Oh, it's a remodeler.

2894
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:19,060
Wait.

2895
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:19,600
It's a...

2896
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:19,680
Nice.

2897
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:20,120
Oh.

2898
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,700
That can control things actually.

2899
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:22,460
Really?

2900
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:23,840
Yeah.

2901
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:25,600
Wow.

2902
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:26,880
Like fart

2903
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:31,120
one?

2904
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:31,720
Yeah.

2905
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:32,040
Hold on.

2906
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,540
Watch.

2907
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,980
Is there a standpoint in this?

2908
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,080
Was that the...

2909
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:43,560
No.

2910
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:43,980
Never mind.

2911
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:44,720
That was the whoopee cushion.

2912
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,140
I thought it was the sound of a mine.

2913
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:48,860
Oh.

2914
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,440
A chemical jug.

2915
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:52,400
Cool.

2916
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,080
Nice.

2917
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:54,700
It's still big though.

2918
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:55,240
I know.

2919
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,120
There's nothing here.

2920
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,000
No.

2921
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,100
I don't think so.

2922
01:45:58,620 --> 01:45:59,580
There was like a...

2923
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:00,880
Way down here though.

2924
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,380
There's also a fire escape here.

2925
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:02,480
Oh.

2926
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,700
That's a fire exit.

2927
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:04,240
Yeah.

2928
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:05,380
But I'm not sure I trust in it.

2929
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:06,860
Do we have that mod?

2930
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,500
There's not like a fire exit in it.

2931
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,600
I can't...

2932
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,080
Let me hit this.

2933
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:12,580
And then...

2934
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:13,820
And then you just jump.

2935
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,740
Maybe it's safe.

2936
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:15,340
Maybe it's safe.

2937
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:16,480
Okay.

2938
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:19,860
I'm not sure I trust in it.

2939
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:20,480
I don't think so.

2940
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,400
We're fine.

2941
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,260
We know how to get out.

2942
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:23,060
Yeah.

2943
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:23,300
Yeah.

2944
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:23,480
Yeah.

2945
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:23,600
Yeah.

2946
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:28,450
Let's go...

2947
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:29,210
What's this say?

2948
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:29,990
What?

2949
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:31,110
Nothing.

2950
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:32,570
It's a dead end.

2951
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:33,150
Oh!

2952
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,030
There's a light there.

2953
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:34,650
Yeah.

2954
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:37,810
It's the real dump, right?

2955
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:38,730
Okay.

2956
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:41,830
I'm going to put my stuff outside real quick.

2957
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:42,270
Yeah.

2958
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:42,910
I heard something too.

2959
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:44,990
Oh.

2960
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,310
Oh.

2961
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,710
Actually, I'm going to bring the whoopee cushion.

2962
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:06,920
Oh.

2963
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:07,360
Yippee.

2964
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:08,060
You can kill it.

2965
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:08,440
Okay.

2966
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:08,620
I'm going to...

2967
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,840
Kill it with the thing!

2968
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:15,820
Wait, where are they?

2969
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:21,060
Where are you guys?

2970
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:22,220
Guys?

2971
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,120
Oh, they're over here.

2972
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,760
Yeah, kill it with the shovel.

2973
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:43,610
Kill it!

2974
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:44,450
Kill it!

2975
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:45,170
Yeah!

2976
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,190
Yeah!

2977
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:47,210
Yeah!

2978
01:47:49,690 --> 01:47:50,410
Ouch!

2979
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:51,330
Ouch!

2980
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:54,110
Wait, wait.

2981
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:56,190
I think it's dead.

2982
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,450
I think it's dead.

2983
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:01,170
We got him.

2984
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:03,450
Koi, we got him.

2985
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:07,290
He's so toxic.

2986
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:09,730
He's so toxic.

2987
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:15,570
Is there anything else in here?

2988
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:16,510
Did you take it home?

2989
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:19,130
I don't think so.

2990
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:22,090
There is a mine over here.

2991
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:22,970
Yeah, there's a mine.

2992
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:23,650
Watch out.

2993
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:27,610
It's like right there.

2994
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:29,150
Let's not step on it.

2995
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:30,690
Let's not step on it.

2996
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:33,870
It's okay.

2997
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:34,970
We got it.

2998
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:38,330
Ta-da!

2999
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:40,370
Okay.

3000
01:48:40,610 --> 01:48:41,910
Can we get this way?

3001
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:43,970
Oh, there's another door.

3002
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:46,170
Why?

3003
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:49,970
We can go this way.

3004
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:51,470
We can go this way.

3005
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:52,150
Is that okay?

3006
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:54,890
Oh, I found something.

3007
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:55,810
Oh, a key.

3008
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:58,650
I got it.

3009
01:48:59,390 --> 01:48:59,830
Nice.

3010
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:02,330
There's something in here.

3011
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:03,650
There's a magnifying glass.

3012
01:49:03,730 --> 01:49:04,490
Magnifying glass.

3013
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:05,530
Let's go.

3014
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:06,210
Nice.

3015
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:08,730
We left a lot of stuff at the entrance too.

3016
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:09,910
Yeah, same.

3017
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:10,910
Okay.

3018
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:13,130
I think we found a good amount.

3019
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:14,230
I can't tell.

3020
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:14,910
I can't see anything.

3021
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:16,370
Oh, it's okay.

3022
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:18,830
Follow...

3023
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:20,370
Lead the way.

3024
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:21,210
I hear them laughing.

3025
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:23,470
Oh, this way?

3026
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:24,190
I think.

3027
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:25,070
Hello?

3028
01:49:25,450 --> 01:49:28,270
I think there's something over there.

3029
01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:29,430
What?

3030
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:32,430
Which way?

3031
01:49:32,890 --> 01:49:33,830
Oh, this way.

3032
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:37,030
There's a fire.

3033
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:39,110
Oh!

3034
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:40,690
Oh!

3035
01:49:41,810 --> 01:49:42,810
It's a spark!

3036
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:43,090
Oh!

3037
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:46,530
Hello there.

3038
01:49:46,890 --> 01:49:47,690
What do we do?

3039
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:49,290
I think you can kill it also, right?

3040
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:51,290
Yeah, you can kill it.

3041
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:54,890
Do you want to jump on the railing and kill it?

3042
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:55,710
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3043
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:56,930
Jump on the railing and kill it.

3044
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:58,410
Okay, okay, 50k.

3045
01:49:58,570 --> 01:49:59,210
It's yelling.

3046
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:00,110
It's using our voices.

3047
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:01,470
It's done.

3048
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:04,650
No, we can do it.

3049
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:05,190
Come here, come here.

3050
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:07,030
You got this.

3051
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:08,990
Okay.

3052
01:50:08,990 --> 01:50:09,050
Okay.

3053
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,760
I think it might be lurking.

3054
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:29,700
But it might be gone.

3055
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:30,940
Okay, let's go out.

3056
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:31,800
Let's leave, let's leave.

3057
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:34,380
Can you grab their stuff?

3058
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:36,220
Yeah.

3059
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:37,860
Can you...

3060
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:39,640
Go, go, go, go, go!

3061
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:46,730
Your pants are full?

3062
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:48,930
Yeah, with Aira-sama.

3063
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:50,510
My hands are full.

3064
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:51,670
Oh, your hands are full.

3065
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:53,130
Wait, what's the most expensive thing here?

3066
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:55,190
Do you think we can make it two times?

3067
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:56,750
This one's full.

3068
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:57,950
Aira-sama.

3069
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:59,690
Yeah, sorry, Aira-sama.

3070
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:01,990
And we'll come back for her.

3071
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:02,350
Yeah.

3072
01:51:03,210 --> 01:51:05,050
Because money is pretty important, too.

3073
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:08,450
Yeah, she's important, but money is like way important.

3074
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:09,410
Yeah, but money.

3075
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:10,710
Yeah, the money.

3076
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:11,630
Okay, let's go.

3077
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:14,130
Alright, we'll come back, we'll come back.

3078
01:51:14,190 --> 01:51:15,870
Oh, here, I'll take the stone bridge.

3079
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:16,470
You take that one.

3080
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:17,410
Okay.

3081
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:20,050
Okay, guys.

3082
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:21,390
Okay.

3083
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:21,790
So

3084
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,740
far, so good.

3085
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:00,460
So far, so good.

3086
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:02,480
Do we go back?

3087
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,460
Oh, nice whoopee cushion.

3088
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,060
I don't know, I don't know.

3089
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,640
The whoopee cushion was only 14!

3090
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:17,060
Okay, how about I go grab the other stuff and you wait here?

3091
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:17,740
No, no.

3092
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,600
I'll go, I'll go.

3093
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:20,860
Are you sure?

3094
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,140
Okay.

3095
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,040
Hold on.

3096
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,080
It's a lot of responsibility.

3097
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:24,760
Hold on.

3098
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:29,840
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

3099
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:32,480
What do you mean sorry?

3100
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:34,660
What do you mean sorry?

3101
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:35,040
Wait, where is it?

3102
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,420
What do you mean sorry?

3103
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:37,980
What do you mean sorry?

3104
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,980
Min, Min, Min, I got it, I got it.

3105
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:48,560
Okay, okay.

3106
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:49,140
I'll see you all.

3107
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,900
On second thought, the giant is right there.

3108
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,880
Actually, I think I can go, I think I can go.

3109
01:52:58,340 --> 01:52:58,940
You can do it.

3110
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,200
I think we're

3111
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:21,790
in trouble.

3112
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:25,270
I will kill myself before you can kill me, bitch!

3113
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:28,970
You can't kill me!

3114
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:33,330
I won't let you have the satisfaction!

3115
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:35,090
Yeah!

3116
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:37,690
Yeah, try!

3117
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:38,590
Come in here!

3118
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:39,550
Can you swim?

3119
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:40,990
I don't think you can.

3120
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:43,890
I won't let you have the satisfaction!

3121
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:50,870
Oh, I'm still alive.

3122
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:52,190
I can make it.

3123
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:53,670
I can make it.

3124
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:54,910
I can make it.

3125
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:56,610
I can make it.

3126
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:57,590
I can make it.

3127
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:00,430
Oh, no!

3128
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,990
No!

3129
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:11,020
Oh no,

3130
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,260
I have no stamina left!

3131
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:28,400
Emory!

3132
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,040
Emory, it's time to go!

3133
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,680
I like it when you go...

3134
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:41,020
I think Emory is still waiting for you.

3135
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:42,620
Emory, it's time to go!

3136
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,160
Emory, it's time to go!

3137
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:48,160
Emory, it's time to go!

3138
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:51,440
Emory, it's time to go!

3139
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:52,460
Emory, it's time to go!

3140
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,520
She's just sitting there menacingly.

3141
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:55,300
She's just sitting there menacingly.

3142
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:56,540
Oh.

3143
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:03,750
It's okay, dude.

3144
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:05,210
I don't know what time it is.

3145
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:05,590
It's a problem.

3146
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:08,130
Oh, she doesn't know what time it is?

3147
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:10,350
It says the ship is leaving in one hour.

3148
01:55:10,510 --> 01:55:11,050
I think, uh...

3149
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:13,710
Just go!

3150
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:14,630
Just go, Emory!

3151
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:15,410
I think I'm gonna go.

3152
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:16,490
Oh, there it is.

3153
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:18,090
Okay, okay.

3154
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:24,030
Yeah,

3155
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:28,210
something got me, alright.

3156
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:29,950
It's all because I twerked at her.

3157
01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:35,590
Oh my god!

3158
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:37,930
Aida Sama is everything.

3159
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:40,570
D for deceased.

3160
01:55:41,670 --> 01:55:42,490
Welcome back!

3161
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:47,110
I feel like I'm very consistent with being the most paranoid employee.

3162
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:48,830
Oh.

3163
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:50,970
No, that means you're careful.

3164
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:53,470
We lost so much stuff.

3165
01:55:54,970 --> 01:55:56,170
Aw, flashlight.

3166
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:57,470
Yeah.

3167
01:55:58,010 --> 01:55:59,430
And the shovel.

3168
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:01,030
There's one shovel here.

3169
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:02,310
I brought back one.

3170
01:56:02,710 --> 01:56:04,890
I think there's also one in here.

3171
01:56:05,070 --> 01:56:05,450
Oh, nice.

3172
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:10,190
You have like 163 in the ship, I think.

3173
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:12,470
You have like 163 in the ship, I think.

3174
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:12,950
We're good, we're good.

3175
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:14,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so we're good.

3176
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:16,530
Yeah, good job, everyone!

3177
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:19,230
163.

3178
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:19,750
Good job!

3179
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:21,670
I'm sorry to twerk at you.

3180
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:22,530
It's okay.

3181
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:26,550
Oh, the flashlight is on sale in the walkie-talkie.

3182
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:26,810
Wait, what got you?

3183
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:33,690
Well, a titan saw me, or the giant saw me, and I didn't want to give him the satisfaction, so I jumped into the water.

3184
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:34,870
Ah.

3185
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:36,650
Yeah.

3186
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:38,230
That's a gamer move.

3187
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:39,290
Wow, in the water.

3188
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:40,610
Flashlight is on sale.

3189
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:42,570
It's only $6.

3190
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:44,170
Oh, $6.

3191
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,150
Oh, that's cheap, yeah.

3192
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:48,550
It's cheap.

3193
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:51,210
I don't need it, so you guys can have it.

3194
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:54,270
You could grab like two, maybe.

3195
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:57,730
I don't use one either, so...

3196
01:56:57,730 --> 01:56:58,250
I don't use one either, so...

3197
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:00,110
Okay, me and Isla will hold one.

3198
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:00,690
How about that?

3199
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:01,650
Good plan.

3200
01:57:02,590 --> 01:57:04,070
Wait, I have mine, never mind.

3201
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:05,790
I forgot, I still have mine.

3202
01:57:08,230 --> 01:57:08,410
Oops, sorry.

3203
01:57:09,590 --> 01:57:11,490
We just have extra in that case.

3204
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:13,630
That's the shovels.

3205
01:57:13,630 --> 01:57:16,230
I don't really have money, but...

3206
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:17,750
Oh, wow.

3207
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:19,230
That was intense.

3208
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:26,150
Everything looks good.

3209
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:28,010
Where haven't we gone?

3210
01:57:28,150 --> 01:57:28,610
Assurance?

3211
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:31,550
Oh, we've been there.

3212
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:32,030
Oh, March?

3213
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:33,330
I don't think we've gone to March.

3214
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:34,870
Oh, yeah, we haven't.

3215
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:35,890
Okay, let's go to March.

3216
01:57:38,230 --> 01:57:38,750
Nice.

3217
01:57:40,730 --> 01:57:42,130
Oh, wait, there we go.

3218
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:43,890
Are we ready?

3219
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:46,510
Oh, the farm is diverse.

3220
01:57:46,910 --> 01:57:47,770
Here we go.

3221
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:48,330
Diverse?

3222
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:51,810
What could it mean?

3223
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:52,750
Diverse farm?

3224
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:55,770
I have a lot to see.

3225
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:01,370
Hello.

3226
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:03,790
I'm ready to kill.

3227
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:05,690
Oh, I'm ready.

3228
01:58:06,010 --> 01:58:07,790
What do I make my move?

3229
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:10,550
You're free to check the king.

3230
01:58:12,370 --> 01:58:14,210
You think you could get the spider this time?

3231
01:58:14,650 --> 01:58:15,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3232
01:58:15,670 --> 01:58:17,530
Wait, actually, I don't know where it is, though.

3233
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:19,330
On this map.

3234
01:58:19,870 --> 01:58:21,330
Oh, wait, it's this way.

3235
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:23,190
I can see it.

3236
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:26,970
Watch out.

3237
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:27,650
Don't fall in.

3238
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:28,230
Don't fall in.

3239
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:29,970
Be careful.

3240
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:34,310
You will not make it if you fall in.

3241
01:58:34,670 --> 01:58:35,090
Yeah.

3242
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:37,230
You will pass away, probably.

3243
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:39,110
Maybe.

3244
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:40,330
Sport advisor.

3245
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:41,450
Yeah.

3246
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:43,830
Let's go.

3247
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:46,290
Wee-hoo!

3248
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:49,730
Oh, Luigi.

3249
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:50,270
Did you guys hear that?

3250
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:51,950
Did you guys hear that?

3251
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:54,910
Oh, yeah, that's the flashlight.

3252
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:55,890
That was the flashlight.

3253
01:58:56,310 --> 01:58:57,730
Go get it, go get it.

3254
01:58:58,250 --> 01:58:59,190
Go get it!

3255
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:01,130
There's a large axel.

3256
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:04,430
Wait, if someone... Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3257
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:05,710
Where's the axel?

3258
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:07,450
Right here.

3259
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:10,250
Try picking it up and then dropping it.

3260
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:11,470
Dropping it?

3261
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:14,050
Oh, my God.

3262
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:14,930
Oh,

3263
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:20,730
my God.

3264
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:22,670
Oh, nice!

3265
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:27,010
Oh, hello.

3266
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:35,470
I got jumpscared.

3267
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:39,710
That's so good.

3268
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:40,710
That's so good.

3269
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:43,230
Nice.

3270
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:45,750
I can hear it.

3271
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:47,250
I can hear it from inside.

3272
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:49,690
Oh, is that loud?

3273
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:50,270
Yeah.

3274
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:52,310
Did you miss the flashlight?

3275
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:54,610
I missed it.

3276
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:55,270
What?

3277
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:56,290
You missed it?

3278
01:59:58,250 --> 01:59:59,230
There's nothing in here.

3279
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:04,290
Oh, no.

3280
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:05,810
At least it was on sale.

3281
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:07,390
Yeah, yeah.

3282
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:07,950
It's okay.

3283
02:00:08,190 --> 02:00:10,490
This is the only way we can go.

3284
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:15,050
Down is the only way.

3285
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:15,550
Watch out.

3286
02:00:15,570 --> 02:00:16,770
There's a mine down here, though.

3287
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:17,890
Okay, okay.

3288
02:00:18,030 --> 02:00:18,650
Be careful.

3289
02:00:19,790 --> 02:00:20,770
Oh, okay.

3290
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:21,830
On the floor?

3291
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:23,150
Yeah, on the floor.

3292
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:25,850
Okay.

3293
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:27,710
Oh, there's a...

3294
02:00:28,410 --> 02:00:29,550
There's a clown...

3295
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:32,710
Did you find something?

3296
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:33,170
Oh!

3297
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:33,210
Oh!

3298
02:00:33,490 --> 02:00:35,250
It's me.

3299
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:36,910
I found my accessory.

3300
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:45,740
It looked like a flashlight.

3301
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,060
It's right here.

3302
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:49,240
Where's everyone?

3303
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:50,940
Over here!

3304
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:52,720
Hello!

3305
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:56,180
You're camouflaging.

3306
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:56,980
Oh, I am?

3307
02:00:57,620 --> 02:00:58,320
Sorry.

3308
02:00:59,360 --> 02:00:59,680
I know.

3309
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,440
I'm so sneaky.

3310
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,140
Hahaha.

3311
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:01,320
Hahaha.

3312
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:05,180
Oh, there's one more.

3313
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:06,440
Hmm.

3314
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:07,600
Hmm.

3315
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,280
So dark.

3316
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,460
It is really dark.

3317
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,000
This is dead end?

3318
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:15,620
What was that?

3319
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:18,460
What was that?

3320
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,460
What was that?

3321
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,200
I'm trying to conserve the battery.

3322
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:24,460
Oh, there's a door here.

3323
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,060
I heard something.

3324
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,100
There's a door over here.

3325
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,160
Oh, nice.

3326
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:31,560
There's a door over here.

3327
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:33,920
And leads into here.

3328
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:36,200
Oh, there's another axle.

3329
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:37,740
Oh, let's go!

3330
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,100
Oh, someone should hold it.

3331
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:40,820
Hahaha.

3332
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:44,500
Someone else should hold that so I can have the flashlight.

3333
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:44,980
I got it.

3334
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:45,460
I got it.

3335
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:48,200
There's some more down.

3336
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:51,880
That's so good.

3337
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:53,940
So good.

3338
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:56,660
Sorry.

3339
02:01:58,500 --> 02:01:59,720
Hit him with a shovel.

3340
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:00,380
Where is he?

3341
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:00,840
Where is he?

3342
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:01,760
Oh, no.

3343
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:02,900
What's that?

3344
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:06,300
You guys, it's a spring.

3345
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,400
It's a spring bag.

3346
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,640
It's a coil head.

3347
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:09,280
Coil head.

3348
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:11,360
Come on, come on, come on.

3349
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:13,900
It follows you.

3350
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:15,640
Really?

3351
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:17,940
Come on, come on, come on.

3352
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,500
Yeah, you have to look at him.

3353
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:23,440
Is this a duck?

3354
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,100
Is this a real duck?

3355
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:26,520
It's me, it's me, it's me.

3356
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:30,120
Wait, you guys, I can't turn around.

3357
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:30,800
Where are you?

3358
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:43,510
Hi, how are you?

3359
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:43,870
Johnny.

3360
02:02:44,170 --> 02:02:44,570
Okay.

3361
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:47,350
This way?

3362
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:48,290
Slowly.

3363
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:51,370
Turn around and then let's close the door.

3364
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:52,010
Okay.

3365
02:02:54,630 --> 02:02:55,890
This is a dead end.

3366
02:02:56,010 --> 02:02:56,530
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

3367
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:00,690
Can he go through the...

3368
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:02,410
There's no way out here.

3369
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:03,730
Wait, are we trapped?

3370
02:03:05,290 --> 02:03:06,250
Yeah, we're trapped.

3371
02:03:06,490 --> 02:03:07,370
This is a dead end.

3372
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:08,290
Why did you guys...

3373
02:03:08,290 --> 02:03:10,030
Why did you guys lead us to a dead end?

3374
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:13,590
We can get around him, we can get around him.

3375
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:14,950
I think.

3376
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:16,190
Okay.

3377
02:03:17,010 --> 02:03:17,330
Uh.

3378
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:18,970
Uh.

3379
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:19,950
Uh.

3380
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:22,650
Hello.

3381
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:31,200
I'm looking at him, you guys are good.

3382
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,460
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

3383
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:33,640
I'm looking.

3384
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:37,600
Oh no, this is a dead end.

3385
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:38,440
Okay.

3386
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:38,980
Okay.

3387
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,320
I'm looking at him still.

3388
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:42,580
I'm looking.

3389
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:45,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3390
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:46,880
We're going, we're going, we're going.

3391
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:50,760
I can't see anything.

3392
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:52,440
I can't see anything.

3393
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,120
It's a dead end.

3394
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:01,800
Okay.

3395
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:02,820
It's a dead end.

3396
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:08,300
I think we're gonna die.

3397
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:14,120
We're good.

3398
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:15,520
We're good.

3399
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:17,640
We're good.

3400
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:23,140
Oh my goodness.

3401
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:25,380
It's really dark.

3402
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:26,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3403
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:39,970
Back here, back here.

3404
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:43,710
What does he need to do?

3405
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:46,290
Oh, he's right there, he's right there.

3406
02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:47,870
Yeah, it's a dead end, it's a dead end.

3407
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,920
Don't, stop pushing me.

3408
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:54,520
Stop.

3409
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:04,370
Uh oh.

3410
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:05,750
Uh oh.

3411
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:07,530
Who am I hearing?

3412
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:10,470
Okay, where are we going?

3413
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:19,490
I think we're alive.

3414
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:20,430
I think we're alive.

3415
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:21,190
There's a thumper.

3416
02:05:21,690 --> 02:05:22,370
Let's go here.

3417
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:23,130
Here, here, here.

3418
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:23,850
There's a door here.

3419
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:24,750
Okay.

3420
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:26,030
I don't know where it's here.

3421
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:29,570
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

3422
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:30,490
Where's Goku?

3423
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:32,830
Where's Goku?

3424
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:34,950
Yeah, why do we keep getting these guys?

3425
02:05:35,070 --> 02:05:36,150
Oh shoot, it's a dead end.

3426
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:48,820
Yeah, I think that's the same door we went through before.

3427
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:49,740
Oh my god.

3428
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:50,140
What?

3429
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,180
It looks like the dead end.

3430
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:54,200
Yeah, we can't go there.

3431
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:56,080
Tall and handsome.

3432
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:57,000
Where do we go?

3433
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,580
Oh my god.

3434
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:01,160
Uh...

3435
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:04,560
No, this one's the one with the theme.

3436
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:07,520
Wait,

3437
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:14,460
the thumper totally ignored me.

3438
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:15,580
Oh, never mind.

3439
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:18,700
Sayonara!

3440
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,120
Sayonara!

3441
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:20,220
Ta -da!

3442
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:25,060
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

3443
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,440
I don't wanna be alone.

3444
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:28,420
I don't wanna be alone.

3445
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:29,740
Oh, there's a dead end.

3446
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:30,820
Oh, shoot.

3447
02:06:31,180 --> 02:06:33,540
Is everybody dead?

3448
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:34,100
I'm lost!

3449
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:34,680
I'm lost!

3450
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:36,400
This is the dead end.

3451
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:37,480
Oh.

3452
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:38,560
Oh,

3453
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:57,440
she got him.

3454
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:57,760
Nice.

3455
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,440
It's still dead?

3456
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:02,360
Oh my god.

3457
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:06,560
She got the animal too.

3458
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:14,510
Who's yelling?

3459
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:16,030
Can you find a way out, Arasama?

3460
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,210
When I died, I dropped the apple and it made a...

3461
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:19,810
Wait, is it just the three of you?

3462
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,860
Can you find a way out?

3463
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:27,880
I'll try to follow you.

3464
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,140
Oh no, he's blocking the way.

3465
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:30,960
Really?

3466
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:32,580
Yeah, I can't get out.

3467
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,240
I think you can touch him.

3468
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,980
It's a dead end.

3469
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:37,660
It's a dead end.

3470
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:39,900
Can you repeat the axle sound?

3471
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:41,780
I guess we're soft locked.

3472
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:44,300
I think the other monster is like...

3473
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:46,800
The skinwalker.

3474
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:47,660
Excuse me!

3475
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,740
Excuse me!

3476
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:52,500
Oh wait, they actually can't move?

3477
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:54,300
Oh no, I think he's actually blocking.

3478
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,200
Can I push him?

3479
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:58,000
Push him away?

3480
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:01,600
I think they have to not look and then...

3481
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:04,960
They might have to run for it.

3482
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,100
Maybe crouch?

3483
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:10,560
There it is!

3484
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:10,880
There it is!

3485
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:11,860
I can go out now!

3486
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:12,480
I don't know!

3487
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:13,100
Oh my god!

3488
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:14,980
Oh my god,

3489
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:40,410
it's so funny!

3490
02:08:43,230 --> 02:08:44,410
Where is Goku?

3491
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:45,790
I don't know!

3492
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:50,490
I don't think it's properly working.

3493
02:08:50,490 --> 02:08:51,610
I don't think it's working, yeah.

3494
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:53,710
We lost everything.

3495
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:56,650
Have any of us seen a Bracken?

3496
02:08:56,730 --> 02:08:58,010
Yeah, we've seen the Bracken.

3497
02:08:58,790 --> 02:08:59,530
But it didn't work.

3498
02:09:00,530 --> 02:09:01,110
It's okay.

3499
02:09:01,590 --> 02:09:03,290
Rip Goku.

3500
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:08,450
They got him!

3501
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:09,170
They got him!

3502
02:09:10,530 --> 02:09:11,310
Oh man.

3503
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:13,070
We lost everything.

3504
02:09:13,970 --> 02:09:16,590
Wait, someone said Val has high Goku chance?

3505
02:09:16,970 --> 02:09:17,450
Really?

3506
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:18,730
Should I believe you?

3507
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:20,170
I'm gonna believe you.

3508
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:21,570
Can we go there?

3509
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:24,070
It's foggy though.

3510
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:25,030
It's foggy.

3511
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:27,690
It's gonna be hard.

3512
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:30,090
We gotta take risks.

3513
02:09:30,350 --> 02:09:32,770
We're at zero money here.

3514
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:33,550
You're right.

3515
02:09:33,670 --> 02:09:34,730
You're so right.

3516
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:36,530
Here we go.

3517
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:38,830
Here we go.

3518
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:40,350
No pain, no gain.

3519
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,750
No pain, no gain.

3520
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:43,690
Let's go, baby.

3521
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:44,770
Yeah.

3522
02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:47,610
Goku in the fog.

3523
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,060
Yeah.

3524
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:54,480
Kawaii.

3525
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:55,700
Let's go.

3526
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:57,460
Let's go.

3527
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:58,640
Yeah, it's foggy.

3528
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,300
Don't have any items too.

3529
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:01,580
Now we got nothing.

3530
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:04,360
Wait, how do we get to the...

3531
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:05,260
Where's the door?

3532
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:08,000
We keep scanning, I guess.

3533
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,880
Yeah, just keep scanning.

3534
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:11,760
Alright, here we go.

3535
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:14,300
I think it's this way actually, right?

3536
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:15,000
Yeah, this way.

3537
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:16,240
Yeah, the bridge.

3538
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:17,480
Maybe we have to find the bridge.

3539
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:18,400
Yeah, I think it's this way.

3540
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:21,160
Oh.

3541
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,400
Planticor.

3542
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:26,300
It's just Emery.

3543
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,120
I got jumpscares.

3544
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:29,400
I know, I'm very scary.

3545
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:30,360
Oh yeah, right here.

3546
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:32,460
Oh, there you go.

3547
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:33,880
The palm creek one?

3548
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:34,280
Yep.

3549
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:35,840
Where's Naki?

3550
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:37,940
Naki?

3551
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,160
Naki?

3552
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:40,820
Naki!

3553
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:42,320
Naki!

3554
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:46,460
Uh oh.

3555
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:48,600
She's not dead already.

3556
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:50,680
There's no way.

3557
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:51,920
Naki!

3558
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:54,220
Naki!

3559
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:55,640
Should we show you what?

3560
02:10:56,380 --> 02:10:57,320
I'm gonna go inside.

3561
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:00,580
And you guys, if you find her...

3562
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,000
Bring her over.

3563
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:07,300
Right here.

3564
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:08,580
Alright.

3565
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:15,920
Actually, it's quite spooky being in here by myself.

3566
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:19,300
But if it's the word Goku...

3567
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:19,960
Oh!

3568
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,140
You made it!

3569
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:22,860
Yeah!

3570
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:25,620
They're looking for... Yeah, they're looking for...

3571
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,060
They're looking for you outside.

3572
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:27,180
Here, let's go tell them.

3573
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:28,160
Oh!

3574
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:37,770
Hi!

3575
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:38,470
Naki's inside!

3576
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:41,430
I found a way!

3577
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:42,050
Is that you?

3578
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:43,910
Is that you, Naki?

3579
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:46,830
Oh my god, Emery went to look for you!

3580
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:50,150
Oh my god, Emery went to look for you.

3581
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:50,470
Oh my god, Emery went to look for you.

3582
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:51,610
Okay, Emery will come back.

3583
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:52,230
It's fine.

3584
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,770
Yeah, yeah.

3585
02:11:54,630 --> 02:11:55,950
I gotta find Emery.

3586
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:57,370
Emery!

3587
02:11:57,370 --> 02:11:58,230
Emily!

3588
02:11:59,890 --> 02:12:02,470
How did she navigate in this fog?

3589
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:03,430
It's so hard.

3590
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:04,730
You should have just left me.

3591
02:12:08,430 --> 02:12:09,530
How did you get that?

3592
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,910
Yeah, I got this.

3593
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:12,610
But...

3594
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:13,750
Emily!

3595
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:16,750
I'm gonna go back in.

3596
02:12:22,650 --> 02:12:24,210
Emily might be lost.

3597
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,170
Yeah, maybe.

3598
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:27,250
Yeah, maybe.

3599
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:31,830
Money over friendship.

3600
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:32,760
Money over friendship.

3601
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:39,200
Goku.

3602
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:42,560
Goku.

3603
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:44,040
Did I sacrifice myself?

3604
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:45,620
Yeah.

3605
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:49,360
Yeah, we gotta find a little bit.

3606
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:49,940
Go!

3607
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:51,080
Yay!

3608
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:53,040
Oh, everyone's here!

3609
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:54,460
Yay!

3610
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,680
I almost got lost again.

3611
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:59,240
You have to find me in that fog.

3612
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:00,520
Hahaha.

3613
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:03,900
Careful with that.

3614
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:07,980
Oh, it's another freaking name.

3615
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,080
Yeah, I hate these ones.

3616
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:10,840
Oh, there's something.

3617
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,160
Oh no, he's okay.

3618
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,980
Oh, he's okay?

3619
02:13:14,980 --> 02:13:15,400
Really?

3620
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:18,780
He'll leave you there.

3621
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:20,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3622
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:23,220
Just don't get too close to him, you know?

3623
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,500
He wants personal space, I guess.

3624
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:28,440
Actually, I don't know where he is though.

3625
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:30,160
Yeah.

3626
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:30,980
That's too dark.

3627
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:32,480
Oh, in here is a big room.

3628
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:34,620
Oh, there's a lot in here.

3629
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:36,160
Dude!

3630
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:38,340
Nice!

3631
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:41,240
Oh, do you want me to carry something?

3632
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:42,720
I can carry.

3633
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:43,620
I'm good.

3634
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:45,840
Oh, there's a staircase over here too.

3635
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:48,460
Oh, I'm gonna go down.

3636
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:50,060
Goku.

3637
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:51,880
Goku.

3638
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,160
Doku.

3639
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:56,540
Goku.

3640
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:59,340
What the heck?

3641
02:14:02,570 --> 02:14:02,950
Oh, really?

3642
02:14:02,950 --> 02:14:04,910
Not only one, but two.

3643
02:14:06,530 --> 02:14:07,010
Wow.

3644
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:07,710
That's steel.

3645
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:08,730
Nice.

3646
02:14:10,130 --> 02:14:10,610
Double.

3647
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:13,670
Okay, I got hairbrushes.

3648
02:14:13,670 --> 02:14:15,730
I didn't fully inspect this room yet though.

3649
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:16,010
Is there anything else?

3650
02:14:16,150 --> 02:14:16,430
Oh, yeah.

3651
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:18,370
But there's one more room.

3652
02:14:18,850 --> 02:14:19,530
Oh, there is?

3653
02:14:19,590 --> 02:14:20,950
Oh, there's more.

3654
02:14:21,370 --> 02:14:24,910
Yeah, I don't like the sound of that though.

3655
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:27,350
Is it the fog?

3656
02:14:27,450 --> 02:14:28,110
The steam?

3657
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:31,190
Oh no, it's just this thing.

3658
02:14:31,630 --> 02:14:32,810
It's just the power.

3659
02:14:34,330 --> 02:14:35,170
Oh, yeah.

3660
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:37,030
Oh, I can't flip the switch.

3661
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:38,670
I can't see anything.

3662
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:40,730
Oh, there we go.

3663
02:14:42,190 --> 02:14:43,790
Oh, there's a lot of stuff down here.

3664
02:14:43,850 --> 02:14:44,910
There's a lot of stuff down here.

3665
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:44,930
Oh, really?

3666
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:46,470
Yeah, it seems like it.

3667
02:14:46,730 --> 02:14:48,830
Oh, there we go.

3668
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:50,010
Oh, right here.

3669
02:14:50,150 --> 02:14:50,850
I'm a liar.

3670
02:14:51,590 --> 02:14:52,490
I can hold stuff.

3671
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,390
I'm a liar.

3672
02:14:53,530 --> 02:14:54,330
There's nothing here.

3673
02:14:54,490 --> 02:14:55,330
Oh, there's nothing here.

3674
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:57,570
It's like a gas chamber.

3675
02:14:57,770 --> 02:15:00,630
I thought this shadow was something.

3676
02:15:01,190 --> 02:15:03,190
Yeah, it's actually you.

3677
02:15:04,150 --> 02:15:05,150
Where's Naki?

3678
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:09,310
I think she's being really adventurous.

3679
02:15:12,430 --> 02:15:14,430
Oh, he's here again!

3680
02:15:17,630 --> 02:15:18,490
It's okay.

3681
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:21,550
Uh oh.

3682
02:15:21,710 --> 02:15:22,850
We gotta go back.

3683
02:15:23,050 --> 02:15:23,610
Bye.

3684
02:15:24,350 --> 02:15:26,870
Have anyone seen a Bracken?

3685
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:27,950
Bye.

3686
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:28,970
Oh, wait.

3687
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:29,930
Where is it?

3688
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:31,090
I'm looking at him.

3689
02:15:31,730 --> 02:15:32,570
Oh, god.

3690
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:33,990
Wow.

3691
02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:37,270
Do we go down or over here?

3692
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:38,150
Down?

3693
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:39,470
Down?

3694
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:41,110
Yeah,

3695
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:52,690
the stairs over here.

3696
02:15:52,850 --> 02:15:53,190
Oh, okay.

3697
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:55,230
Oh, yeah.

3698
02:15:55,390 --> 02:15:55,950
That's right.

3699
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:02,390
I'm looking at

3700
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:11,480
him.

3701
02:16:11,980 --> 02:16:12,260
You're looking?

3702
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:13,320
Okay.

3703
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:16,620
It's right over here.

3704
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:17,140
It's over here.

3705
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:19,580
I think it's this one.

3706
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:20,940
There's another door over here.

3707
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:21,780
Oh, wait.

3708
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:22,960
I don't know which one it is then.

3709
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:24,060
Hey!

3710
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:24,660
I'm looking!

3711
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:25,080
I'm looking!

3712
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:25,380
Hey!

3713
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,140
You cheater!

3714
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:27,040
You cheater!

3715
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:28,360
I'm looking at you!

3716
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:31,700
You can't do that!

3717
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:33,440
There's a door over here!

3718
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:34,540
Which door is it?

3719
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:35,600
Here!

3720
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,440
Over here!

3721
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:38,560
Okay, let's go this way.

3722
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:39,580
I'm looking at him.

3723
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:42,400
I'm looking at you!

3724
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:44,440
Yeah, he's a big old cheater.

3725
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:14,660
Yeah.

3726
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:15,240
Oh my god.

3727
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:16,380
No!

3728
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:17,720
Oh, it's fine.

3729
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:18,940
We were dead anyway.

3730
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:20,860
Yeah, it's okay.

3731
02:17:22,580 --> 02:17:23,580
Oh, boy.

3732
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:27,080
Do we want to just go to another moon?

3733
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:27,960
We're getting tired.

3734
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,520
Yeah, maybe a more...

3735
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:31,980
challenging moon?

3736
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:33,480
For higher value?

3737
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:35,500
I don't think... Well, we're gonna die.

3738
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:38,800
We don't have enough money to do a challenging moon.

3739
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:40,100
Oh, true.

3740
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,340
Yeah, wait, what's...

3741
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:46,220
Yeah...

3742
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:47,660
Um...

3743
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:50,260
The way we all died there.

3744
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:51,720
So funny.

3745
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:53,760
Wait, Naki, how did you die?

3746
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:55,760
Ooh!

3747
02:17:56,140 --> 02:17:57,800
Your glove is so fancy, man.

3748
02:17:58,560 --> 02:17:59,640
Where's the coil head?

3749
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:03,380
Oh, wait, you died to the coil head?

3750
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:05,600
As well.

3751
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:09,320
I got separated, and I was the one who met him.

3752
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:11,580
Coil head.

3753
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:12,680
Coil head.

3754
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:15,620
Ah, so purple.

3755
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:19,540
There's a free moons mod?

3756
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:20,500
Really?

3757
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:20,980
What?

3758
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:24,580
There's apparently a free moons mod.

3759
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:25,560
Oh.

3760
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:27,580
I didn't know that.

3761
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:28,640
I didn't know that either.

3762
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:34,700
You know what, let's just go to...

3763
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:36,000
experimentation.

3764
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:37,560
Okay.

3765
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:40,340
There was also a gambling mod I hesitated on adding.

3766
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,340
Wait, what's that?

3767
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:43,920
Um, you can like...

3768
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:46,300
On the last day, you can like...

3769
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,500
take all your items, and if it's not enough...

3770
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:50,240
you could like, try a hand at gambling...

3771
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,760
to see if you can make them worth more.

3772
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:52,500
Ooh!

3773
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,740
Yeah, that's cool.

3774
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:01,820
Alright, are we going?

3775
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:02,980
Yep, let's just go.

3776
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:06,500
We're not gonna live, but we can at least explore.

3777
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,960
Oh, it says we have to go to the company.

3778
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:09,700
What?

3779
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:10,780
They changed it!

3780
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:12,040
Yeah, that's true.

3781
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:13,500
Yeah, let me see.

3782
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:14,960
Let me try it one more time.

3783
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:17,200
We can hold it, I think.

3784
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:18,600
Oh yeah, I just need to hold it.

3785
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:20,760
Yeah, just hold it.

3786
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:21,100
Yeah.

3787
02:19:22,940 --> 02:19:23,480
Nice!

3788
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:27,740
We're not following your rules, company!

3789
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:29,660
Yeah!

3790
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:31,520
Company sucks!

3791
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:34,060
Yeah, we're dead anyway.

3792
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:37,280
We're dead men walking.

3793
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:39,260
Woohoo!

3794
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:39,860
Woohoo!

3795
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:42,640
It is so purple.

3796
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:44,220
We're rebelling.

3797
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:45,540
Yeah, we're rebelling.

3798
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,040
Yeah!

3799
02:19:48,580 --> 02:19:49,100
Pumpkins!

3800
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:51,300
Pumpkins!

3801
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:53,280
Pumpkins!

3802
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,900
Pumpkins is over there.

3803
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:01,940
I wanna go to the mansion, but it costs a lot.

3804
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:03,220
It does cost a lot.

3805
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:05,320
I'm gonna go through the fire escape here.

3806
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:06,220
Okay.

3807
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:10,120
I think it's this way, yeah.

3808
02:20:10,300 --> 02:20:11,180
Yeah, it's up this way.

3809
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:11,820
Up the stairs.

3810
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:12,780
Up the stairs!

3811
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:18,580
Going stairs.

3812
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:20,760
I'm coming in.

3813
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:25,460
Hello?

3814
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:31,200
Oh, there we go.

3815
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:33,120
Oh my god.

3816
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:33,920
Oh shoot, it's locked.

3817
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:34,920
We can't go out.

3818
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:36,060
There's a wedding ring!

3819
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:36,540
There's a wedding ring?

3820
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:38,480
I can grab it.

3821
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:40,040
A wedding ring?

3822
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,600
I'm trying.

3823
02:20:40,900 --> 02:20:42,080
I'm trying to grab it.

3824
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:43,560
I guess

3825
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:59,080
we gotta leave though.

3826
02:21:02,750 --> 02:21:04,310
Wow, that must be worth a lot.

3827
02:21:04,690 --> 02:21:06,030
I think it was like 80 something.

3828
02:21:07,130 --> 02:21:07,250
I think it was like 80 something.

3829
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:08,070
Oh my god.

3830
02:21:08,170 --> 02:21:10,050
Engagement ring is very expensive.

3831
02:21:10,470 --> 02:21:13,350
I will choose who to marry.

3832
02:21:13,550 --> 02:21:16,140
Whoever gathers the most items.

3833
02:21:19,070 --> 02:21:21,330
It is a battle of survivors.

3834
02:21:21,330 --> 02:21:21,390
It is a battle of survivors.

3835
02:21:21,910 --> 02:21:23,390
She wants to marry to money.

3836
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:28,630
No, no, no.

3837
02:21:28,770 --> 02:21:31,290
It's not the money.

3838
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:32,250
It's the...

3839
02:21:33,090 --> 02:21:34,030
It's the...

3840
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:47,700
It's your sense of adventure.

3841
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:50,000
I'll follow next.

3842
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:52,720
Oh, that scared me.

3843
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:53,260
What was that?

3844
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:54,740
I have that already.

3845
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:55,700
It was just a door.

3846
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:57,000
Oh, there's a gift box.

3847
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,480
There's a gift box.

3848
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:00,440
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

3849
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:01,900
Here, there you go, Emily.

3850
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:04,460
I did the last one.

3851
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:05,640
How do you open it?

3852
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:08,020
Just left click, I think.

3853
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:09,360
Yeah, you guys ready?

3854
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:10,040
Yeah.

3855
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:17,830
It's so good.

3856
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:30,330
And the radiation's been here.

3857
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:31,830
Oh my god.

3858
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:35,290
It's okay.

3859
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:37,110
A little radiation won't hurt.

3860
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:37,710
What was that sound?

3861
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:38,990
Oh, there's another one.

3862
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:39,850
There's one more.

3863
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:40,830
What, really?

3864
02:22:41,650 --> 02:22:45,970
Oh my gosh, there's so many of them.

3865
02:22:46,850 --> 02:22:47,210
Yeah.

3866
02:22:48,470 --> 02:22:50,750
Wait, this is the same area, right?

3867
02:22:50,830 --> 02:22:51,430
Oh, this is the same.

3868
02:22:51,550 --> 02:22:52,670
Yeah, we just went in a circle.

3869
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:53,950
Oh, yeah, we just went in a circle.

3870
02:22:56,390 --> 02:22:57,490
Wait, which way was it?

3871
02:22:57,730 --> 02:22:58,230
This way?

3872
02:22:58,330 --> 02:22:58,510
Yeah.

3873
02:23:02,230 --> 02:23:03,010
Follow me.

3874
02:23:03,130 --> 02:23:03,730
That way?

3875
02:23:04,150 --> 02:23:06,750
Did we go down?

3876
02:23:07,310 --> 02:23:08,270
I think so.

3877
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:10,490
Oh, there's nothing here.

3878
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:11,090
Nothing here.

3879
02:23:12,530 --> 02:23:13,570
Nothing here.

3880
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,930
One, one, one.

3881
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:21,430
Okay.

3882
02:23:21,490 --> 02:23:21,870
There we go.

3883
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:23,490
Okay, we've got...

3884
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:29,690
What if we all drop it at the same time?

3885
02:23:29,830 --> 02:23:30,290
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3886
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:32,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3887
02:23:33,870 --> 02:23:34,450
Three.

3888
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:35,310
Two.

3889
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:36,390
One.

3890
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:49,720
Got it?

3891
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:51,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3892
02:23:52,180 --> 02:23:52,500
Alright.

3893
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:54,180
Okay.

3894
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:55,940
Let's go.

3895
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:56,840
Bring it home.

3896
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:00,680
Oh shoot, there's bees?

3897
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:01,940
No, those are fine.

3898
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:03,960
I think those are fine.

3899
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:04,840
Yeah.

3900
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:06,300
Yeah, it should be fine.

3901
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:08,920
Yeah, the bees only gather around the...

3902
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:11,380
The harmful bees gather around the hive.

3903
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:12,860
Oh.

3904
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:13,980
Yeah.

3905
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:14,620
Alright.

3906
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:16,260
Wow.

3907
02:24:21,070 --> 02:24:22,510
Actually, we got this here.

3908
02:24:24,110 --> 02:24:25,610
Let's go see if we can find Goku.

3909
02:24:26,510 --> 02:24:27,590
I'm gonna go.

3910
02:24:28,130 --> 02:24:29,250
I'm gonna go.

3911
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:31,170
I'm gonna find Goku.

3912
02:24:32,470 --> 02:24:33,610
Goku, where are you?

3913
02:24:34,830 --> 02:24:35,430
Goku.

3914
02:24:35,430 --> 02:24:37,450
Where are you?

3915
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:40,150
Actually, that's what this wedding ring is for.

3916
02:24:40,310 --> 02:24:40,910
It's for him.

3917
02:24:42,070 --> 02:24:42,910
Oh, it's dark.

3918
02:24:44,130 --> 02:24:44,610
Goku!

3919
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:46,970
I know you're afraid of commitment.

3920
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:49,030
I know you have Chi-Chi.

3921
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:50,390
But what about Mimi?

3922
02:24:58,590 --> 02:24:59,870
I don't think that's Goku.

3923
02:25:03,770 --> 02:25:04,650
Riz him up.

3924
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:09,480
I can't see eyes.

3925
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:10,040
Oh.

3926
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:11,540
Oh, hello.

3927
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:13,400
Hi, there's a thumper.

3928
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:15,120
Oh, okay.

3929
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:15,800
Oh, there she is.

3930
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:18,220
Yeah, I don't think we can go over there.

3931
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:20,260
Why?

3932
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:22,680
Um...

3933
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:26,200
Um, I think, yeah.

3934
02:25:26,260 --> 02:25:27,000
I think we should...

3935
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,260
That was

3936
02:25:31,450 --> 02:25:32,010
a close one.

3937
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:34,830
It's...

3938
02:25:34,830 --> 02:25:36,390
He's probably gone.

3939
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:41,410
Did you wanna, like, propose to the thumper?

3940
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:43,230
I was trying to find Goku.

3941
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:44,970
Oh, Goku.

3942
02:25:44,970 --> 02:25:45,990
Goku, sir.

3943
02:25:46,290 --> 02:25:48,510
It wasn't Goku?

3944
02:25:49,010 --> 02:25:49,510
No.

3945
02:25:50,990 --> 02:25:52,950
Man, the fabled Goku.

3946
02:25:58,850 --> 02:26:00,690
I think I led it.

3947
02:26:01,090 --> 02:26:02,330
Oh my gosh.

3948
02:26:02,710 --> 02:26:03,850
The thumper's in the way.

3949
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:05,830
Yeah, we can't go any further.

3950
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:07,350
Man.

3951
02:26:07,350 --> 02:26:07,690
Man.

3952
02:26:09,510 --> 02:26:09,950
Man.

3953
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:11,310
I thought you guys were gonna die.

3954
02:26:12,170 --> 02:26:13,870
Can't believe he's blocking us from Goku.

3955
02:26:14,270 --> 02:26:14,630
You know what?

3956
02:26:15,950 --> 02:26:16,850
You know what?

3957
02:26:16,990 --> 02:26:18,350
This guy is a jerk.

3958
02:26:18,530 --> 02:26:19,670
I'm gonna go teach him a lesson.

3959
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:22,130
Hey, you.

3960
02:26:23,790 --> 02:26:24,910
Hey, get out of here.

3961
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:26,190
This is our...

3962
02:26:28,230 --> 02:26:28,890
I'm okay.

3963
02:26:29,810 --> 02:26:30,250
Yeah?

3964
02:26:30,610 --> 02:26:31,690
Yeah, I'm actually okay.

3965
02:26:32,470 --> 02:26:33,350
Let's go.

3966
02:26:33,410 --> 02:26:35,190
I don't know where I am, though.

3967
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:36,730
I think he's gonna die.

3968
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:42,780
You good?

3969
02:26:59,310 --> 02:27:01,300
Where are you, Goku?

3970
02:27:02,430 --> 02:27:02,790
Oh.

3971
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:12,460
No, Ebony, I'm hearing...

3972
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:14,160
Oh, god.

3973
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:17,520
I was hearing more voices.

3974
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:20,600
I was hearing the Ebony from the dead.

3975
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:22,620
That was not Goku.

3976
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:25,380
That was just a disappointment.

3977
02:27:25,740 --> 02:27:27,000
It's not Goku at all.

3978
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:28,860
It's just sad.

3979
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:33,460
You're an imposter?

3980
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:35,220
Are you the real Ayasama?

3981
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:37,100
Yes.

3982
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:38,440
You can quiz me.

3983
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:42,000
Only the real Ayasama would know the right answers.

3984
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:43,760
Only the real Ayasama would know the right answers.

3985
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,160
Ayasama cute.

3986
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:49,140
Oh, wow.

3987
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:51,640
No, that's the imposter.

3988
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:53,140
Me?

3989
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:55,500
No, no, no.

3990
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:57,480
It's her.

3991
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:58,260
It's her.

3992
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:01,720
Because she said, oh, I'm gonna teach this monster a lesson.

3993
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:02,840
And then she died.

3994
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:04,040
I didn't die.

3995
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:05,520
Ebony died.

3996
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:09,760
Oh, my god.

3997
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:11,480
Ayasama is sus.

3998
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:12,480
Sus.

3999
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:13,300
Sus.

4000
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:14,140
Sus.

4001
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:15,240
Sus.

4002
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:15,780
Sus.

4003
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:24,580
I'm not sus.

4004
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:25,940
I'm not sus.

4005
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:26,500
I'm not sus.

4006
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:29,100
You know what?

4007
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:33,660
I'm gonna walk off this ship.

4008
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:37,840
Ayasama, you did this.

4009
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:38,860
Oh, my god.

4010
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:43,520
Because she's the imposter.

4011
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:44,440
Yeah.

4012
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:47,320
Yeah.

4013
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:48,960
I am the imposter.

4014
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:51,880
I'm gonna take us all down.

4015
02:28:52,060 --> 02:28:53,160
I'm gonna take us all down.

4016
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:54,560
No!

4017
02:28:56,660 --> 02:28:57,160
Ah!

4018
02:29:00,060 --> 02:29:00,560
No!

4019
02:29:02,220 --> 02:29:02,620
No!

4020
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:05,880
Oh, uh-oh.

4021
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:06,920
You...

4022
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:08,420
You're not gonna leave without me, right guys?

4023
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:09,680
That'd be crazy.

4024
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:10,300
Alright.

4025
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,140
Wait.

4026
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:15,360
I thought you were going to go.

4027
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,300
Yeah.

4028
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:17,980
Alright.

4029
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,640
You gotta shake it.

4030
02:29:22,740 --> 02:29:24,860
You think Ebony's gonna come back any time soon?

4031
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:26,600
Oh, she's dead!

4032
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:27,380
I saw it!

4033
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:30,140
I think we should leave.

4034
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:31,560
I think we should leave.

4035
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:32,960
I'm gonna teach this guy a lesson.

4036
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:47,360
What is happening?

4037
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:50,980
Hello, welcome to the dead.

4038
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:53,580
Hello, I've been here the whole time.

4039
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:59,000
Oh my gosh, they didn't believe you that I died.

4040
02:29:59,080 --> 02:29:59,760
They left.

4041
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,420
And now we're all gonna die together.

4042
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:05,520
You are paranoid!

4043
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,360
You're gaslighting us!

4044
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,100
We owe a dollar.

4045
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:16,340
We owe one money.

4046
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:18,020
Here we go.

4047
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:19,160
Time to die!

4048
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:21,880
Let's die!

4049
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,300
Let's die!

4050
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:27,080
They can't catch me over here.

4051
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:29,300
You should propose to someone before we die.

4052
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:30,620
You should use the wedding ring!

4053
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:31,660
Use the ring!

4054
02:30:31,700 --> 02:30:36,300
One money.

4055
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:44,020
One single money.

4056
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:47,400
07 everybody.

4057
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:48,980
The maid brigade.

4058
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:50,580
Hello!

4059
02:30:51,620 --> 02:30:52,040
Hello!

4060
02:30:53,020 --> 02:30:55,100
Oh, we're back to our normal suit.

4061
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:56,180
Yay!

4062
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:56,960
Oh, boo!

4063
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:57,640
I'm changing.

4064
02:30:58,400 --> 02:30:59,220
Boo, yeah!

4065
02:30:59,220 --> 02:30:59,280
Yeah!

4066
02:30:59,740 --> 02:30:59,840
Yeah!

4067
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:01,120
Luigi!

4068
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:02,500
My minion, Zwerbee!

4069
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:03,020
My minion, Zwerbee!

4070
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:04,140
Okay.

4071
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:08,520
Well, I feel like I've met you guys before.

4072
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:10,800
It's Deja Vu?

4073
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:11,340
It's Deja Vu.

4074
02:31:11,860 --> 02:31:12,520
Oh, yeah.

4075
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:13,420
My god, maybe Mario!

4076
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:15,600
I've never met you guys before.

4077
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:16,500
Mamma mia!

4078
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:22,500
I've never met you before in my life, except you, my brother.

4079
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:24,340
She didn't remember us.

4080
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:25,120
She's so sad.

4081
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:28,960
You should know her, but you're both Nintendo.

4082
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:30,860
Yeah, I was gonna say, you look pretty familiar.

4083
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:33,580
Are you my real brother?

4084
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:35,000
Yahoo!

4085
02:31:42,220 --> 02:31:43,700
I can't believe it's a real Mario.

4086
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:43,960
That's pretty convincing.

4087
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:47,220
I thought, not gonna lie, I thought you were my Princess Peach.

4088
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:49,380
Oh, happy to see you.

4089
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:49,660
Cheers!

4090
02:31:50,900 --> 02:31:52,240
I thought you were Waluigi.

4091
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:54,400
I mean, Wario.

4092
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:55,100
I thought you were Wario.

4093
02:31:55,100 --> 02:31:56,360
I thought you were Wario.

4094
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:57,520
Why do girls become such a Rizzler?

4095
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:02,700
My god, it is sauce.

4096
02:32:02,780 --> 02:32:03,580
Red is sauce.

4097
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:05,240
Ah, yeah.

4098
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:06,420
Red is sauce.

4099
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:07,540
Red is sauce.

4100
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:11,420
Nah, this is... I'm Mario with a...

4101
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:11,760
I don't know, brother.

4102
02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:13,260
I think you changed a little.

4103
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:14,160
Yeah, I've changed.

4104
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:16,800
I'm Mario from actual New York.

4105
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:17,820
I'm from Mario...

4106
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:20,440
Brooklyn.

4107
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:26,860
So Brooklyn does you.

4108
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:27,540
Yeah.

4109
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:29,640
That's been a hard life.

4110
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:33,500
Mario with attitude.

4111
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:36,480
Let's see.

4112
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:39,860
You guys wanna try to get the mansion?

4113
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:43,500
Yeah, let's play like serious and we'll try to get the mansion.

4114
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:43,900
Yeah, yeah.

4115
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:44,620
Okay, okay.

4116
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:45,720
Let's try to get the mansion.

4117
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:47,980
I don't know what the numbers mean.

4118
02:32:48,220 --> 02:32:49,640
I've never been in here.

4119
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:52,600
We can go to March again.

4120
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:53,240
We can try.

4121
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:54,520
Ooh.

4122
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:55,300
Yeah.

4123
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:57,220
Oh, oh, okay.

4124
02:32:57,320 --> 02:32:58,060
Oh, oh, okay.

4125
02:32:58,060 --> 02:32:58,920
Sorry, I confirmed.

4126
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:02,740
Let's do this.

4127
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:04,580
Let's do this for real.

4128
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:06,340
Oh, constant rain.

4129
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:07,140
It's raining.

4130
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:08,160
Oh, no, wait.

4131
02:33:08,380 --> 02:33:09,480
It didn't say it was raining.

4132
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:10,000
No.

4133
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:12,020
It says constant rain.

4134
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:13,260
Where?

4135
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,620
Oh, there we go.

4136
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:14,940
The conditions.

4137
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:16,040
Oh, no.

4138
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:17,480
Can we change?

4139
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:18,760
Can we change?

4140
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:19,140
Yeah, I think so.

4141
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:21,040
The rain has lightning strike, right?

4142
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:21,880
Yeah, I think so.

4143
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:23,880
Yeah, it didn't say.

4144
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:24,500
What do they mean?

4145
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:24,500
The numbers.

4146
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:25,420
What do they mean?

4147
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:25,680
Let's try.

4148
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:27,100
Ooh.

4149
02:33:27,820 --> 02:33:30,340
There's rend, dine, and titan.

4150
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:30,840
Right.

4151
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:32,720
Those are the ones that we can't afford.

4152
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:34,500
Oh, we can't afford them?

4153
02:33:34,580 --> 02:33:35,320
Yeah, they're like 600.

4154
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:37,020
What?

4155
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:37,780
No.

4156
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:38,760
No, it is.

4157
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:39,600
Should we go back to Bao?

4158
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,000
Maybe experimentation is pretty easy.

4159
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,460
Yeah, I think we'll go with the classic.

4160
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:48,220
Yeah.

4161
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:48,820
Okay.

4162
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:51,100
Oh, my gosh.

4163
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:51,740
You turned off the lights.

4164
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:55,140
Okay.

4165
02:33:55,420 --> 02:33:57,980
Oh, someone said that's just flavor text, not the weather.

4166
02:33:58,320 --> 02:33:58,700
Really?

4167
02:33:59,140 --> 02:34:00,300
So it's not actually raining?

4168
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:01,360
Oh, really?

4169
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:01,480
Oh, really?

4170
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:01,860
Really?

4171
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:02,220
Okay.

4172
02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:02,480
Oh.

4173
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:03,860
Okay, let's just go to it then.

4174
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:06,200
Yeah, that might be just the description.

4175
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:06,920
Can you tell the truth?

4176
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:08,640
Are we gaslighting?

4177
02:34:08,660 --> 02:34:09,120
Oh, wait.

4178
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:10,160
Are we gaslighting yet?

4179
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:11,620
I can't tell actually.

4180
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:13,500
I don't feel like I trust.

4181
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:14,860
That's true.

4182
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:16,920
Now to go to Luigi's Mansion.

4183
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:19,020
Oh, we gotta go there eventually.

4184
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:19,640
Wahoo.

4185
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:20,160
Wahoo.

4186
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:20,420
Yeah, we have to get money.

4187
02:34:20,540 --> 02:34:21,880
We have to get money to go there.

4188
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:22,900
Wahoo.

4189
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:23,280
Wahoo.

4190
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:25,920
Okay.

4191
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:29,140
Only if it says it on the list.

4192
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:34,520
Yeah, but one time it didn't say eclipse and it was actually eclipse.

4193
02:34:36,660 --> 02:34:37,620
Yeah, that's true.

4194
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,580
We can try it.

4195
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:39,820
Okay.

4196
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,680
We'll learn something now.

4197
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:41,400
Oh.

4198
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:42,500
Oh, it's time.

4199
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:42,940
Okay.

4200
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:44,160
Okay.

4201
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:45,560
Okay.

4202
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:47,220
There we go.

4203
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:49,440
I'm the Luigi number one.

4204
02:34:50,280 --> 02:34:53,260
I think I like me.

4205
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:54,460
We are playing Mario now.

4206
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:04,880
Oh yeah, it is fine.

4207
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:06,700
Yeah, yeah, it looks okay.

4208
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:07,480
Okay.

4209
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:08,500
Woo!

4210
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:29,060
We made it!

4211
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:34,720
Got something.

4212
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:36,060
Got something immediately.

4213
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:38,900
It's right there.

4214
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:40,840
I'm just going to leave it outside.

4215
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:43,180
There we go.

4216
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,420
It's really dark.

4217
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:50,080
I'm with you.

4218
02:35:51,620 --> 02:35:52,600
I'm behind you.

4219
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:53,520
Dead end, dead end.

4220
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:55,780
Turn around.

4221
02:35:56,180 --> 02:35:56,520
What's that?

4222
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:00,040
It's me.

4223
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:00,420
It's me.

4224
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:01,460
The leader.

4225
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,020
It's a dead end.

4226
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:04,100
Oh, mama mia.

4227
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:07,280
Mama mia.

4228
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:17,110
I think I'm going to get lost in here, brother.

4229
02:36:18,050 --> 02:36:18,510
Yeah.

4230
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:20,830
There's a door over there.

4231
02:36:21,450 --> 02:36:22,190
It's lit up.

4232
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:25,270
There's a key.

4233
02:36:25,850 --> 02:36:26,330
There's a key.

4234
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:28,090
I got an engine.

4235
02:36:28,610 --> 02:36:29,250
Got it?

4236
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:32,690
There's a key over there.

4237
02:36:32,730 --> 02:36:33,950
I think you can.

4238
02:36:34,050 --> 02:36:35,050
I think you can do it, brother.

4239
02:36:35,410 --> 02:36:36,350
I believe in you.

4240
02:36:37,870 --> 02:36:39,790
Mama Luigi number one!

4241
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:51,660
There should be a platform.

4242
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:53,680
There we go.

4243
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:54,840
It's over here.

4244
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:57,140
Oh, there you go.

4245
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:00,680
She did it!

4246
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:04,320
Can you get to the door over there too?

4247
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:06,280
Yeah.

4248
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:08,640
Is there anything in there?

4249
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:11,780
It's the same maze.

4250
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:13,380
Oh, it's another maze?

4251
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:16,540
Yeah, it might be connected to the other room.

4252
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:17,320
Do you want me to...

4253
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:18,180
Well, it might be.

4254
02:37:18,580 --> 02:37:19,680
Do you want me to come over there?

4255
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:23,100
Can you with that big thing?

4256
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:23,860
Yeah.

4257
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:25,920
Okay, don't die.

4258
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:29,680
I'm a Luigi number one!

4259
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:32,180
I'm a Luigi number one!

4260
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:32,400
Yeah!

4261
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:34,600
Oh, I do whatever you...

4262
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:36,400
Everything my brother cannot...

4263
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:38,420
I... I... I...

4264
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:39,040
I love you.

4265
02:37:40,660 --> 02:37:41,260
Oh.

4266
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:42,180
I love you.

4267
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:45,280
I'm sorry, Mario.

4268
02:37:45,740 --> 02:37:46,500
I love you.

4269
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:48,280
Mamma mia!

4270
02:37:51,400 --> 02:37:52,000
No!

4271
02:37:52,120 --> 02:37:52,620
No!

4272
02:37:53,940 --> 02:37:56,180
All that parkour for nothing.

4273
02:37:56,380 --> 02:37:57,200
I guess I gotta go back.

4274
02:37:57,840 --> 02:37:58,060
What?

4275
02:37:58,060 --> 02:37:58,480
What?

4276
02:38:00,340 --> 02:38:01,300
Be careful.

4277
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:02,760
Very good.

4278
02:38:03,460 --> 02:38:04,920
Wait, do we go here or there?

4279
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:07,200
We haven't gone this way.

4280
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:09,100
We can check it out.

4281
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:11,860
What's that noise over here?

4282
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:12,940
What is that sound?

4283
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:14,560
If we

4284
02:38:18,430 --> 02:38:20,270
pass through there, it'll...

4285
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:21,550
It's a trap!

4286
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:23,750
I think it's a trap, yeah.

4287
02:38:26,070 --> 02:38:26,630
Retreat!

4288
02:38:26,630 --> 02:38:27,130
Retreat!

4289
02:38:27,550 --> 02:38:28,110
Retreat.

4290
02:38:28,110 --> 02:38:28,150
Retreat!

4291
02:38:28,910 --> 02:38:31,430
I thought you were good at dodging traps, Mario.

4292
02:38:31,950 --> 02:38:32,690
I what?

4293
02:38:32,770 --> 02:38:33,610
I dodged the trap!

4294
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:34,330
What are you talking about?

4295
02:38:36,070 --> 02:38:37,450
I did that!

4296
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:38,370
I did dodge!

4297
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:41,510
My brother on the other hand, poor...

4298
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:43,310
Poor fool.

4299
02:38:43,850 --> 02:38:44,970
My brother died.

4300
02:38:47,050 --> 02:38:48,030
I'm scanning.

4301
02:38:48,450 --> 02:38:48,850
Oh!

4302
02:38:48,870 --> 02:38:49,410
Nice.

4303
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:50,950
Oh, we made it!

4304
02:38:51,130 --> 02:38:51,750
Was that all Naoki?

4305
02:38:51,990 --> 02:38:52,730
I think so.

4306
02:38:55,090 --> 02:38:57,590
She was gaming while we were...

4307
02:38:58,110 --> 02:38:58,190
Yeah!

4308
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:04,430
We said we were going to play for real!

4309
02:39:04,850 --> 02:39:05,410
What are we doing?

4310
02:39:06,410 --> 02:39:07,670
What is that?

4311
02:39:09,510 --> 02:39:10,070
The...

4312
02:39:10,070 --> 02:39:11,810
Oh, it's just a thing.

4313
02:39:11,870 --> 02:39:12,590
A manticore.

4314
02:39:30,220 --> 02:39:31,060
Ayla-sama!

4315
02:39:35,260 --> 02:39:36,440
Was she already...

4316
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:38,140
Was she already dead?

4317
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:44,980
I think we should just go home.

4318
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:47,860
Go?

4319
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:49,440
I think they're dead.

4320
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:49,860
Yeah.

4321
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:50,900
They are dead.

4322
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:53,820
I think we should just go.

4323
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:57,060
I'm going to start the ship.

4324
02:39:57,820 --> 02:39:58,340
Yeah.

4325
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:00,200
I think we should just leave.

4326
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:01,400
I think it's fine.

4327
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:04,340
Does Emily feel a part more?

4328
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:05,320
Yeah.

4329
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:07,780
That's what happened.

4330
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:10,620
Yeah.

4331
02:40:11,260 --> 02:40:12,020
It's okay.

4332
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:15,000
I'm ashamed to be the brother anymore.

4333
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:18,220
I'm ashamed to be the brother anymore.

4334
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:21,700
She's supposed to be glad jumping.

4335
02:40:22,100 --> 02:40:24,620
It means the camera shakes the most.

4336
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:26,040
When you're paranoid, you're like...

4337
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:27,480
Like shaking the camera.

4338
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:28,880
Oh, really?

4339
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:30,820
Yeah, I think so.

4340
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:33,760
Big bro!

4341
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:35,940
Where did big bro go?

4342
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,200
He abandoned me!

4343
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:38,460
I'm big boss now.

4344
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:40,180
I know.

4345
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:42,960
He just acknowledged I'm the better brother.

4346
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:46,220
I didn't want to be related to you any longer.

4347
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:47,140
I'm ashamed.

4348
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:50,020
Wait, are you Knuckles?

4349
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:51,580
Are you Knuckles?

4350
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:52,420
I'm Knuckles.

4351
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:54,900
Oh my god, there is Knuckles in here.

4352
02:40:57,220 --> 02:40:58,420
What does it look like?

4353
02:40:58,440 --> 02:40:59,140
She's wearing a mask.

4354
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:00,140
What is Slayer?

4355
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:02,540
What is Slayer?

4356
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:03,360
What do I look like?

4357
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:05,500
Um...

4358
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:06,820
What is that?

4359
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:09,340
It's like a green and black suit.

4360
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:12,160
You have a Mountain Dew behind you.

4361
02:41:12,180 --> 02:41:12,460
Oh, I do?

4362
02:41:12,700 --> 02:41:13,160
I'm a Gamer?

4363
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:14,220
Yeah, you do.

4364
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:17,600
Red Mountain Dew.

4365
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:18,780
Now you have an eyeball!

4366
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,200
Oh, banana!

4367
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:22,080
Banana!

4368
02:41:22,960 --> 02:41:23,520
Banana!

4369
02:41:26,500 --> 02:41:27,620
Well, I'm Doomguy?

4370
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:28,880
You have a yellow sign.

4371
02:41:29,060 --> 02:41:29,980
I think it suits you.

4372
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:31,400
The yellow?

4373
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,140
It's okay.

4374
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:36,100
Now that Mario's gone, I'm the best brother.

4375
02:41:36,260 --> 02:41:36,700
It's okay.

4376
02:41:36,820 --> 02:41:38,340
It's all according to Luigi's plan.

4377
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:40,260
Yes, of course.

4378
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:41,420
Yes, yes.

4379
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,700
I was the better brother all along.

4380
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:47,800
Let's see...

4381
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:49,640
Um...

4382
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:52,780
We can go to March again or experimentation.

4383
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:57,720
Do you like that, Isla-sama?

4384
02:41:58,200 --> 02:41:58,740
Yeah.

4385
02:42:00,360 --> 02:42:01,640
Do you like that?

4386
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:02,940
Do you like that?

4387
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:04,460
Can you do that again?

4388
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,200
Oh my god.

4389
02:42:06,520 --> 02:42:15,120
If you pay for a place, you just keep pressing the button and you don't have to pay for it again until you die.

4390
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:16,080
Oh, wow.

4391
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:22,040
Where are we going?

4392
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:24,440
We can just go to March again.

4393
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:25,640
Okay.

4394
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:27,640
Since we're already here.

4395
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:28,600
I want...

4396
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:35,820
We're playing for real, guys.

4397
02:42:36,020 --> 02:42:36,380
We're playing for real, guys.

4398
02:42:36,400 --> 02:42:37,440
This is the real deal.

4399
02:42:38,280 --> 02:42:39,740
This is the real deal.

4400
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:39,840
This is the real thing.

4401
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:40,800
No death run.

4402
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:43,060
This is the run.

4403
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:44,080
This is the run.

4404
02:42:45,380 --> 02:42:47,800
Zero death speed run, any percentage.

4405
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:48,480
Exactly.

4406
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:52,340
All right.

4407
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:54,280
Go, go, go, go.

4408
02:42:54,700 --> 02:42:56,200
Watch out for the hole.

4409
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,780
Go, go, go, go.

4410
02:42:59,160 --> 02:42:59,760
Yahoo.

4411
02:43:00,020 --> 02:43:00,860
Oh my god.

4412
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:03,100
I have it in my blood.

4413
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:05,400
I'm not Mario anymore, but I can't stop Yahooing.

4414
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:06,200
You're not Mario anymore.

4415
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:08,320
It's in my genes.

4416
02:43:08,420 --> 02:43:09,340
It's in my DNA.

4417
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:10,440
It's Yahoo.

4418
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:17,250
I want to keep saying Yahoo so the skin walker will say it.

4419
02:43:18,130 --> 02:43:18,730
Yahoo.

4420
02:43:19,730 --> 02:43:20,330
Yahoo.

4421
02:43:20,570 --> 02:43:21,130
Yahoo.

4422
02:43:22,170 --> 02:43:22,770
Yoshi.

4423
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:28,500
Yoshi.

4424
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:31,880
Yahoo.

4425
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:34,880
Let's see what's down here.

4426
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:37,260
I think it's a dead end.

4427
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:37,680
Oh, no.

4428
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:38,340
Never mind.

4429
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:39,560
No, there's more.

4430
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:40,200
Oh, there's a key.

4431
02:43:40,980 --> 02:43:41,460
Nice.

4432
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:43,820
Oh, it's the light thing.

4433
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:46,200
It's the apparatus.

4434
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:46,840
Yeah.

4435
02:43:49,640 --> 02:43:50,600
Oh, money.

4436
02:43:51,480 --> 02:43:51,960
Money.

4437
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:53,840
I can't grab this bottle.

4438
02:43:53,960 --> 02:43:54,420
What the heck?

4439
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:55,060
I know.

4440
02:43:55,260 --> 02:43:56,240
Why is it...

4441
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:57,440
Grab

4442
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:00,940
it.

4443
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:02,120
Should I get the apparatus?

4444
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,400
Oh, we can wait.

4445
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:04,400
We can have the...

4446
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:05,140
Yeah, I think we can wait.

4447
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:05,660
Yeah.

4448
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:08,420
Yeah, it's too far in.

4449
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:11,060
Oh, it's just a loop, I think.

4450
02:44:11,180 --> 02:44:12,520
Wait, this is where we came from, right?

4451
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:13,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4452
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:14,540
I think so.

4453
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:15,760
Yeah.

4454
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4455
02:44:19,060 --> 02:44:20,780
I'm gonna leave this outside.

4456
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:21,380
I'll come back.

4457
02:44:26,570 --> 02:44:28,730
Did you hear me drop it from out there?

4458
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:31,090
I didn't hear it.

4459
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:34,210
I don't think it goes to the door.

4460
02:44:34,310 --> 02:44:34,930
Oh, there's a metal sheet.

4461
02:44:35,470 --> 02:44:36,150
I got it.

4462
02:44:36,190 --> 02:44:36,370
Where?

4463
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:37,790
I got a sheet.

4464
02:44:37,950 --> 02:44:38,650
Which way did you go?

4465
02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:41,030
I went downstairs, but I think it's dead end.

4466
02:44:41,030 --> 02:44:41,650
Oh, we're downstairs.

4467
02:44:41,870 --> 02:44:42,250
Oh, no, no.

4468
02:44:42,290 --> 02:44:42,610
There's more.

4469
02:44:42,650 --> 02:44:43,030
There's more.

4470
02:44:43,050 --> 02:44:43,490
There's more here.

4471
02:44:43,730 --> 02:44:44,170
There's more?

4472
02:44:44,470 --> 02:44:44,790
Okay.

4473
02:44:44,930 --> 02:44:45,250
Yeah.

4474
02:44:45,310 --> 02:44:46,490
Come on, brother.

4475
02:44:47,110 --> 02:44:47,430
Yahoo.

4476
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,180
Oh, there's another metal sheet.

4477
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:54,640
Oh, nice.

4478
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:56,340
Yahoo.

4479
02:44:56,820 --> 02:44:59,160
I do have a key in case there's anything lost.

4480
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:00,320
Oh, there's a V-type engine.

4481
02:45:00,460 --> 02:45:00,820
Oh, watch out.

4482
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:01,080
Watch out.

4483
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:02,220
Oh.

4484
02:45:02,460 --> 02:45:02,960
I don't know.

4485
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:03,780
I heard it.

4486
02:45:03,960 --> 02:45:04,720
I don't know where.

4487
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:05,120
Oh.

4488
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:06,780
Where is it?

4489
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:08,840
Also, the fire exit's here.

4490
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:09,340
We can leave.

4491
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:11,440
Yeah, but where's the mine?

4492
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:14,060
I don't know.

4493
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:15,940
Maybe on a ceiling?

4494
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:17,920
Can it be on a ceiling?

4495
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:19,940
I don't know.

4496
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:20,960
Where is it?

4497
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:22,900
Oh, God.

4498
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:23,880
What the heck?

4499
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:24,700
It seems so close.

4500
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:25,180
It does.

4501
02:45:25,400 --> 02:45:25,640
It does.

4502
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:26,680
Where is it?

4503
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:26,940
I don't know.

4504
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:30,800
It might be over here.

4505
02:45:30,880 --> 02:45:31,560
Like in the corner.

4506
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:36,780
Emily, do we have the fake fire exit mod on?

4507
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:37,380
No, no, no.

4508
02:45:37,420 --> 02:45:38,180
We don't have it.

4509
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:39,220
Oh, we don't have it.

4510
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:39,460
Okay.

4511
02:45:42,140 --> 02:45:43,400
Oh, I got a thing too.

4512
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:45,520
Where is that?

4513
02:45:47,140 --> 02:45:47,540
Hello.

4514
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:48,320
Oh, hi.

4515
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:48,740
Oh.

4516
02:45:48,820 --> 02:45:50,460
Oh, my God.

4517
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:56,820
I said it would be funny if I said that, but it ended up being the mod.

4518
02:46:01,930 --> 02:46:03,030
And we can go.

4519
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:05,370
Wait.

4520
02:46:05,730 --> 02:46:07,170
I don't know how to get back.

4521
02:46:07,370 --> 02:46:09,210
I don't know how to get there from here.

4522
02:46:09,870 --> 02:46:11,050
We can figure it out.

4523
02:46:11,090 --> 02:46:12,030
Watch out.

4524
02:46:12,050 --> 02:46:12,290
Watch out.

4525
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:13,810
Is it this way?

4526
02:46:15,470 --> 02:46:16,510
Oh, are you going straight?

4527
02:46:17,170 --> 02:46:17,610
Wait.

4528
02:46:17,670 --> 02:46:18,050
Which way?

4529
02:46:18,890 --> 02:46:19,450
I'm here.

4530
02:46:19,730 --> 02:46:22,150
I feel like if we go get the high ground, right?

4531
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:23,150
Oh, true.

4532
02:46:23,650 --> 02:46:24,090
True.

4533
02:46:24,270 --> 02:46:24,470
True.

4534
02:46:25,230 --> 02:46:25,670
True.

4535
02:46:25,830 --> 02:46:26,390
So smart.

4536
02:46:27,890 --> 02:46:28,330
Tensai.

4537
02:46:29,930 --> 02:46:31,050
Oh, now I'm lost.

4538
02:46:31,270 --> 02:46:31,930
This way.

4539
02:46:32,270 --> 02:46:32,710
Okay.

4540
02:46:33,570 --> 02:46:33,950
Maybe.

4541
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:35,350
Oh.

4542
02:46:36,610 --> 02:46:37,610
It looks like a ditch.

4543
02:46:40,170 --> 02:46:40,930
This way.

4544
02:46:41,050 --> 02:46:42,750
I feel like we just walked in a circle.

4545
02:46:42,750 --> 02:46:43,470
I think we just walked...

4546
02:46:43,470 --> 02:46:43,910
Watch out.

4547
02:46:43,950 --> 02:46:44,130
Watch out.

4548
02:46:44,250 --> 02:46:44,350
Watch out.

4549
02:46:46,390 --> 02:46:48,790
Are you okay?

4550
02:46:49,390 --> 02:46:50,110
Yeah, I'm good.

4551
02:46:50,450 --> 02:46:50,630
It's safe.

4552
02:46:50,810 --> 02:46:50,970
It's safe.

4553
02:46:53,850 --> 02:46:55,330
I think we can go up here.

4554
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:56,430
Up here.

4555
02:46:56,690 --> 02:46:57,070
Okay.

4556
02:46:57,970 --> 02:46:58,350
Wait.

4557
02:46:58,490 --> 02:46:59,670
Oh, that's the main entrance.

4558
02:46:59,790 --> 02:47:00,050
Okay.

4559
02:47:00,450 --> 02:47:01,230
We're close then.

4560
02:47:01,270 --> 02:47:02,410
We can get from the main entrance.

4561
02:47:03,110 --> 02:47:03,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4562
02:47:04,010 --> 02:47:04,330
Yeah.

4563
02:47:05,010 --> 02:47:06,350
We're not lost.

4564
02:47:06,950 --> 02:47:09,050
Oh, there's a large axle that's gone.

4565
02:47:09,910 --> 02:47:10,990
Oh, I can grab it.

4566
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:11,570
I can grab it.

4567
02:47:11,890 --> 02:47:12,330
Okay.

4568
02:47:12,350 --> 02:47:13,510
Go for it.

4569
02:47:13,530 --> 02:47:13,770
Okay.

4570
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:15,230
Yeah.

4571
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:15,850
Let's go.

4572
02:47:16,470 --> 02:47:17,190
Oh my god.

4573
02:47:17,230 --> 02:47:17,610
Gaming.

4574
02:47:17,650 --> 02:47:18,050
Gaming.

4575
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:20,550
Finally, I'm not...

4576
02:47:23,230 --> 02:47:24,870
You're playing the game for real.

4577
02:47:25,850 --> 02:47:26,290
Yeah.

4578
02:47:26,290 --> 02:47:26,730
Finally.

4579
02:47:27,710 --> 02:47:28,150
Okay.

4580
02:47:28,390 --> 02:47:29,250
And it's good.

4581
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:30,150
It's still early.

4582
02:47:30,150 --> 02:47:30,270
Really?

4583
02:47:31,390 --> 02:47:31,830
Yeah.

4584
02:47:31,830 --> 02:47:32,830
We should be fine.

4585
02:47:33,030 --> 02:47:33,750
We should be good.

4586
02:47:34,050 --> 02:47:35,510
I think Melky and...

4587
02:47:36,350 --> 02:47:37,330
Where are you going?

4588
02:47:38,590 --> 02:47:39,350
I went the wrong way.

4589
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:39,910
I'm okay.

4590
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:45,520
That's the wrong turn.

4591
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:47,700
Okay.

4592
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:49,140
Nice.

4593
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:53,700
I almost forget about that.

4594
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:54,180
I know.

4595
02:47:55,060 --> 02:47:55,880
Nice, guys.

4596
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:56,140
Oh, wow.

4597
02:47:56,200 --> 02:47:57,020
We have a lot of money.

4598
02:47:57,220 --> 02:47:57,560
Yeah.

4599
02:47:58,460 --> 02:47:58,900
Nice.

4600
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:00,600
253.

4601
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:05,270
No.

4602
02:48:05,930 --> 02:48:06,410
No.

4603
02:48:06,990 --> 02:48:08,170
Not the bigger ones.

4604
02:48:08,370 --> 02:48:08,470
No.

4605
02:48:13,070 --> 02:48:14,370
Should we go back?

4606
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:16,270
Let me check the camera.

4607
02:48:16,650 --> 02:48:17,090
Yeah.

4608
02:48:17,090 --> 02:48:17,790
See how they're doing.

4609
02:48:18,730 --> 02:48:19,210
Yeah.

4610
02:48:19,210 --> 02:48:19,330
Yeah.

4611
02:48:22,190 --> 02:48:22,990
She's not moving.

4612
02:48:23,350 --> 02:48:25,030
What's the little green thing?

4613
02:48:26,210 --> 02:48:27,270
Isn't it a loop?

4614
02:48:27,450 --> 02:48:28,270
What about Naki?

4615
02:48:28,470 --> 02:48:29,930
Oh, Naki's coming.

4616
02:48:30,110 --> 02:48:30,710
Oh, Naki's moving.

4617
02:48:31,030 --> 02:48:31,810
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4618
02:48:32,350 --> 02:48:34,490
But she's gonna... I think the green thing is just where they're facing.

4619
02:48:34,750 --> 02:48:35,350
Wait, I don't know.

4620
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:36,070
Oh, I can't tell.

4621
02:48:36,370 --> 02:48:36,890
She's not moving though.

4622
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:37,710
I think she's dead.

4623
02:48:38,570 --> 02:48:39,210
Naki's coming.

4624
02:48:39,910 --> 02:48:40,310
Oh.

4625
02:48:40,830 --> 02:48:41,230
Hmm.

4626
02:48:43,510 --> 02:48:44,310
I hear...

4627
02:48:44,310 --> 02:48:45,410
I hear her.

4628
02:48:50,690 --> 02:48:54,650
I think she was with me.

4629
02:48:54,690 --> 02:48:55,370
I think she fell.

4630
02:48:55,570 --> 02:48:56,310
Oh, she fell.

4631
02:48:56,390 --> 02:48:56,830
Oh, she fell.

4632
02:48:57,090 --> 02:48:57,890
Is she not moving?

4633
02:48:58,150 --> 02:48:58,970
Is she not moving?

4634
02:48:59,230 --> 02:49:00,150
No, she's not moving.

4635
02:49:00,710 --> 02:49:01,490
She's just...

4636
02:49:01,490 --> 02:49:02,550
Yeah, I think she fell.

4637
02:49:02,890 --> 02:49:03,290
Lazy!

4638
02:49:04,250 --> 02:49:04,730
Lazy employee!

4639
02:49:05,050 --> 02:49:05,890
Lazy employee!

4640
02:49:07,430 --> 02:49:08,570
What are you doing?

4641
02:49:08,990 --> 02:49:09,890
You should be paranoid and lazy.

4642
02:49:10,410 --> 02:49:11,350
Paranoid and lazy.

4643
02:49:14,450 --> 02:49:15,270
Wombo combo.

4644
02:49:15,530 --> 02:49:17,990
Ayla-sama, if you can hear this, this one's for you.

4645
02:49:18,910 --> 02:49:19,670
Ayla-sama, if you can hear this, this one's for you.

4646
02:49:20,370 --> 02:49:21,270
You heard us.

4647
02:49:21,470 --> 02:49:23,570
It sounds like an elephant or something.

4648
02:49:24,690 --> 02:49:25,170
Yeah.

4649
02:49:26,150 --> 02:49:26,630
Okay.

4650
02:49:26,710 --> 02:49:29,150
I guess we can go then.

4651
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:29,470
Are we good?

4652
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:30,730
Yeah, we got a lot.

4653
02:49:31,050 --> 02:49:31,550
We can go.

4654
02:49:31,550 --> 02:49:32,770
It's 5pm.

4655
02:49:32,990 --> 02:49:33,790
I think we should go.

4656
02:49:34,390 --> 02:49:35,270
Yeah, okay.

4657
02:49:35,790 --> 02:49:36,370
Go.

4658
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:37,630
Let's go!

4659
02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:44,400
With Ayla-sama.

4660
02:49:46,480 --> 02:49:47,120
With Ayla-sama.

4661
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:48,720
Ayla -sama, she was with me.

4662
02:49:48,900 --> 02:49:50,460
Ayla-sama, she was with me.

4663
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:52,070
She's still with us in spirit.

4664
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:53,120
She's still with us in spirit.

4665
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:55,100
It's true.

4666
02:49:55,180 --> 02:49:58,080
She's probably hearing our voices now and watching us from above.

4667
02:49:58,520 --> 02:49:58,600
Right now.

4668
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:01,440
She's a guardian angel.

4669
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:03,180
I told you!

4670
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:04,340
I told you!

4671
02:50:04,460 --> 02:50:04,600
I'm

4672
02:50:11,630 --> 02:50:11,890
lazy.

4673
02:50:12,290 --> 02:50:13,210
I'm careless.

4674
02:50:13,750 --> 02:50:16,710
I gathered two eggs.

4675
02:50:16,970 --> 02:50:18,650
Two easter eggs.

4676
02:50:18,690 --> 02:50:19,270
That's huge.

4677
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:20,030
That's big.

4678
02:50:20,030 --> 02:50:21,350
That is actually big.

4679
02:50:21,410 --> 02:50:22,310
I just dropped it.

4680
02:50:22,370 --> 02:50:24,170
She's on an easter egg hunt.

4681
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:27,010
But it's not easter anymore.

4682
02:50:27,070 --> 02:50:28,490
Look at my bunny ears.

4683
02:50:30,130 --> 02:50:31,870
Where are we gonna go?

4684
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:32,750
First stop sign.

4685
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:34,390
Can we use this?

4686
02:50:36,570 --> 02:50:38,170
We can go to...

4687
02:50:39,090 --> 02:50:39,710
Offense.

4688
02:50:40,530 --> 02:50:41,770
Whoops, I'm sorry.

4689
02:50:42,110 --> 02:50:42,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4690
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:44,950
Hey, hey.

4691
02:50:45,290 --> 02:50:48,270
This is a professional environment, everybody.

4692
02:50:48,390 --> 02:50:49,170
Stop, stop.

4693
02:50:49,810 --> 02:50:50,430
Yield.

4694
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:51,630
Yield.

4695
02:50:53,210 --> 02:50:54,390
I'm not doing anything.

4696
02:50:56,390 --> 02:50:57,670
Let's go to...

4697
02:50:58,240 --> 02:51:00,130
Self-defence.

4698
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:04,230
Wait, what is this?

4699
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:05,370
Confirm.

4700
02:51:05,390 --> 02:51:06,710
For the big boss.

4701
02:51:08,470 --> 02:51:08,490
Oh.

4702
02:51:10,770 --> 02:51:11,650
That's for me.

4703
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:13,050
Is this for me also?

4704
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:14,090
For you.

4705
02:51:16,330 --> 02:51:17,290
What happened?

4706
02:51:17,630 --> 02:51:19,350
I can't salute back at you.

4707
02:51:19,490 --> 02:51:20,370
Can I twerk at you?

4708
02:51:20,710 --> 02:51:25,070
Why is the bed in the middle of the...

4709
02:51:25,070 --> 02:51:26,570
What's going on?

4710
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:29,710
What's happening?

4711
02:51:29,870 --> 02:51:30,970
You guys are rearranging.

4712
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:33,610
Oh, it's lovely.

4713
02:51:33,790 --> 02:51:34,750
I like the decor.

4714
02:51:36,550 --> 02:51:37,870
We can't get out.

4715
02:51:38,470 --> 02:51:39,410
We gotta rearrange now.

4716
02:51:39,410 --> 02:51:39,890
We're stuck.

4717
02:51:41,970 --> 02:51:43,090
How do we...

4718
02:51:45,030 --> 02:51:46,390
Move it, I'll move it.

4719
02:51:46,510 --> 02:51:47,370
We can go around.

4720
02:51:47,770 --> 02:51:48,350
It's B.

4721
02:51:49,290 --> 02:51:50,990
It's B and you move it.

4722
02:51:51,070 --> 02:51:52,090
I can't move it.

4723
02:51:53,230 --> 02:51:53,910
Oh, sorry.

4724
02:51:55,050 --> 02:51:56,430
Did you hit me?

4725
02:51:57,330 --> 02:51:58,410
No, that wasn't me.

4726
02:51:58,530 --> 02:52:01,550
Who was that?

4727
02:52:01,830 --> 02:52:02,550
How do we move it?

4728
02:52:08,140 --> 02:52:09,120
It wasn't me.

4729
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:10,860
It wasn't me.

4730
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:11,220
I'm innocent.

4731
02:52:12,980 --> 02:52:14,260
Stop sign collected.

4732
02:52:17,160 --> 02:52:18,080
Is it this way?

4733
02:52:18,340 --> 02:52:19,940
Actually, I have no idea where I'm going.

4734
02:52:20,660 --> 02:52:21,940
I wonder who...

4735
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:23,020
They said press B.

4736
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:26,160
Is it this way?

4737
02:52:27,320 --> 02:52:28,900
Actually, I have no idea where I'm going.

4738
02:52:29,060 --> 02:52:29,380
You guys.

4739
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:34,080
Wait, can I jump over here?

4740
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:37,820
Oh, nice.

4741
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:40,320
Now I'm stuck.

4742
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:45,600
Oh, wait.

4743
02:52:50,650 --> 02:52:51,530
What is this?

4744
02:52:51,790 --> 02:52:53,370
Oh, I found it, I found it.

4745
02:52:55,870 --> 02:52:57,050
I think I'm a genius.

4746
02:53:04,370 --> 02:53:05,710
Where's the Scooby Doo mod?

4747
02:53:06,450 --> 02:53:06,710
Oh.

4748
02:53:10,670 --> 02:53:12,170
Doesn't that mean something's close?

4749
02:53:12,950 --> 02:53:13,830
This music?

4750
02:53:15,970 --> 02:53:16,490
Right?

4751
02:53:18,890 --> 02:53:20,010
I'm not crazy, right?

4752
02:53:20,730 --> 02:53:21,610
Yeah, because now...

4753
02:53:22,550 --> 02:53:23,710
Now I can't hear it.

4754
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:24,390
Big bolt?

4755
02:53:24,550 --> 02:53:24,810
Where?

4756
02:53:25,730 --> 02:53:26,690
Oh, mine.

4757
02:53:26,950 --> 02:53:27,650
Mine, okay.

4758
02:53:27,830 --> 02:53:28,050
Hello?

4759
02:53:29,030 --> 02:53:29,550
Wolf?

4760
02:53:31,170 --> 02:53:31,690
Okay.

4761
02:53:31,870 --> 02:53:32,690
Oh, it's over there.

4762
02:53:34,650 --> 02:53:35,850
Are you real?

4763
02:53:36,530 --> 02:53:37,810
You scared me.

4764
02:53:37,810 --> 02:53:38,890
There's a key back here.

4765
02:53:38,970 --> 02:53:40,750
There's a key back here, but don't step on the mine.

4766
02:53:41,010 --> 02:53:43,030
Oh, there's a mine.

4767
02:53:43,610 --> 02:53:45,030
Okay, let me walk through.

4768
02:53:45,250 --> 02:53:46,150
Let me walk through.

4769
02:53:46,190 --> 02:53:46,590
Careful.

4770
02:53:48,410 --> 02:53:49,410
Let's go drop this.

4771
02:53:49,830 --> 02:53:50,890
Nothing else here.

4772
02:53:53,090 --> 02:53:53,730
There's a robot.

4773
02:53:54,150 --> 02:53:56,150
Okay, I'm gonna try.

4774
02:53:57,270 --> 02:53:58,370
You guys don't hear music?

4775
02:53:58,510 --> 02:54:00,010
It's like an ambience, you know?

4776
02:54:00,050 --> 02:54:01,410
It's not like a music, it's like a...

4777
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:13,920
I have no excuse.

4778
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,880
It's going crazy.

4779
02:54:16,180 --> 02:54:17,400
I'll leave it outside.

4780
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:20,010
I have no excuse except...

4781
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:21,940
I have no excuse except...

4782
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:23,460
Except that...

4783
02:54:24,140 --> 02:54:24,760
Except that...

4784
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:26,440
I overcompensated.

4785
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:28,680
Actually getting loot.

4786
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:30,760
I overcompensated.

4787
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:32,360
There's a whole space down there.

4788
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:35,120
In a bad way.

4789
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:36,720
There's a whole area down there.

4790
02:54:37,940 --> 02:54:39,900
Yeah, I'm gonna go back and drop myself.

4791
02:54:39,900 --> 02:54:41,760
I like if you die when you're...

4792
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:43,300
Oh, wow.

4793
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,540
If you die when you're...

4794
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:47,020
What's the word?

4795
02:54:47,700 --> 02:54:48,940
Crouched, you get the...

4796
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:53,840
It's okay.

4797
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:57,880
Wait, did they get the...

4798
02:54:57,880 --> 02:54:58,980
Oh, shoot.

4799
02:54:59,680 --> 02:55:00,440
Kill it.

4800
02:55:00,540 --> 02:55:01,920
Oh, no.

4801
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:06,000
Kill it.

4802
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:06,760
Hit him.

4803
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:07,720
Oh,

4804
02:55:14,650 --> 02:55:14,870
nice.

4805
02:55:15,290 --> 02:55:15,910
Yay.

4806
02:55:16,890 --> 02:55:18,370
I saved your life.

4807
02:55:20,370 --> 02:55:21,730
Oh, I lost the sign.

4808
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:22,310
Oh, my God.

4809
02:55:22,570 --> 02:55:24,390
Thank you for the 50 gift.

4810
02:55:25,850 --> 02:55:27,270
Thank you so much.

4811
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:29,070
Oh, my gosh.

4812
02:55:29,070 --> 02:55:30,090
Thank you so much.

4813
02:55:30,350 --> 02:55:31,510
How are you guys doing today?

4814
02:55:31,730 --> 02:55:34,550
I haven't been able to talk to you so much because of the collab.

4815
02:55:37,310 --> 02:55:38,410
Oh, my God.

4816
02:55:38,410 --> 02:55:39,290
She killed me.

4817
02:55:43,470 --> 02:55:44,510
She's crazy.

4818
02:55:45,530 --> 02:55:46,570
She's crazy.

4819
02:55:47,470 --> 02:55:48,010
She's crazy.

4820
02:55:48,010 --> 02:55:48,470
She's crazy.

4821
02:55:49,130 --> 02:55:51,930
She's lost all control.

4822
02:55:53,010 --> 02:55:54,530
She truly lost it.

4823
02:55:54,530 --> 02:55:56,470
I just wanted to give her a little ball.

4824
02:55:56,670 --> 02:55:58,050
I'm dead and she's laughing.

4825
02:55:58,130 --> 02:55:59,030
What the fuck?

4826
02:55:59,150 --> 02:56:00,890
I was so sorry.

4827
02:56:01,570 --> 02:56:02,950
I'm so sorry.

4828
02:56:04,450 --> 02:56:05,810
You're not sorry.

4829
02:56:05,890 --> 02:56:06,610
What the fuck?

4830
02:56:06,910 --> 02:56:12,710
I told her I was low on HP.

4831
02:56:13,210 --> 02:56:14,810
I told her I was low on HP.

4832
02:56:15,150 --> 02:56:15,750
I'm so sorry.

4833
02:56:15,750 --> 02:56:17,210
I can't.

4834
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:19,770
What do you mean you can't?

4835
02:56:19,770 --> 02:56:20,250
You can't.

4836
02:56:25,590 --> 02:56:27,010
It's so scary.

4837
02:56:27,490 --> 02:56:30,750
I would not ask Isla to help her with anything anymore.

4838
02:56:31,830 --> 02:56:33,130
I don't know the way back.

4839
02:56:36,770 --> 02:56:44,970
I don't know the way back.

4840
02:56:44,970 --> 02:56:47,210
She's going the wrong way.

4841
02:56:47,350 --> 02:56:47,830
Yep.

4842
02:56:47,850 --> 02:56:48,150
That way.

4843
02:56:48,210 --> 02:56:48,570
Good job.

4844
02:56:49,130 --> 02:56:49,950
That way.

4845
02:56:50,030 --> 02:56:50,310
That way.

4846
02:56:50,310 --> 02:56:50,610
Good job.

4847
02:56:50,830 --> 02:56:51,030
Can we follow?

4848
02:56:52,090 --> 02:56:52,570
Yeah.

4849
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:56,930
I'm not laughing.

4850
02:56:57,570 --> 02:56:58,250
Uh oh.

4851
02:56:58,570 --> 02:56:59,250
Uh oh.

4852
02:56:59,610 --> 02:57:01,110
The dogs are already out.

4853
02:57:02,610 --> 02:57:03,090
Oh.

4854
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:11,420
Oh, yeah.

4855
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:11,880
Okay.

4856
02:57:14,200 --> 02:57:14,680
Nice.

4857
02:57:16,980 --> 02:57:17,460
Wait.

4858
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:18,580
Why is it...

4859
02:57:19,420 --> 02:57:21,040
Where did the dog go?

4860
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:23,360
Where did he become a baby?

4861
02:57:24,720 --> 02:57:25,840
I should go back.

4862
02:57:26,700 --> 02:57:27,160
Yeah.

4863
02:57:27,380 --> 02:57:28,200
You should go back Emily.

4864
02:57:34,770 --> 02:57:37,070
I'm not sure she can climb higher way...

4865
02:57:37,070 --> 02:57:37,550
Yeah.

4866
02:57:37,570 --> 02:57:38,570
I dunno if she can.

4867
02:57:41,720 --> 02:57:42,320
Here we go.

4868
02:57:43,220 --> 02:57:43,840
No, no.

4869
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:44,680
This is the main entrance.

4870
02:57:44,940 --> 02:57:45,440
Tell me...

4871
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:46,560
Tell me tell me tell me...

4872
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:47,160
She saw us.

4873
02:57:47,320 --> 02:57:48,480
Tell me tell me tell me tell me.

4874
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:50,500
I don't know why i was so dumb.

4875
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:51,520
She's abdominal.

4876
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:56,540
Of course, I'm watching!

4877
02:58:00,860 --> 02:58:02,240
I'm watching you get lost.

4878
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:02,720
I'm just going around!

4879
02:58:06,300 --> 02:58:07,420
Be careful.

4880
02:58:16,220 --> 02:58:17,700
She killed you?

4881
02:58:20,660 --> 02:58:21,740
Killed you good.

4882
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:22,680
She killed you good.

4883
02:58:25,340 --> 02:58:26,760
Did she also kill you?

4884
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:30,400
No, I died to a bug.

4885
02:58:39,010 --> 02:58:40,250
Oh my god, Naki-san!

4886
02:58:40,330 --> 02:58:40,970
Just crouch!

4887
02:58:41,170 --> 02:58:41,770
Just crouch!

4888
02:58:41,810 --> 02:58:43,530
They won't see you if you crouch!

4889
02:58:47,950 --> 02:58:52,430
I think she's going to die.

4890
02:58:52,590 --> 02:58:53,270
I think she's going to die.

4891
02:58:56,630 --> 02:58:59,190
I wonder if Mint and Emery is dead.

4892
02:58:59,410 --> 02:59:00,170
I hope not.

4893
02:59:02,110 --> 02:59:02,770
I don't know.

4894
02:59:04,370 --> 02:59:06,230
You're the one who killed people!

4895
02:59:06,350 --> 02:59:09,250
I brought this upon myself.

4896
02:59:12,270 --> 02:59:12,710
Crouch!

4897
02:59:12,750 --> 02:59:13,010
Crouch!

4898
02:59:13,030 --> 02:59:13,370
Crouch!

4899
02:59:14,290 --> 02:59:15,630
You can crouch!

4900
02:59:53,890 --> 02:59:55,750
Okay, this is her chance to go though.

4901
02:59:55,810 --> 02:59:56,970
But she's not crouching!

4902
02:59:56,970 --> 02:59:57,630
She won't crouch!

4903
02:59:57,990 --> 03:00:00,510
This is all on you now!

4904
03:00:01,290 --> 03:00:03,070
I can hear their voices.

4905
03:00:03,170 --> 03:00:03,710
What the frick?

4906
03:00:04,070 --> 03:00:05,070
You can hear us?

4907
03:00:07,770 --> 03:00:08,310
Crouch!

4908
03:00:08,310 --> 03:00:10,950
If you can hear us, crouch and go!

4909
03:00:14,250 --> 03:00:17,960
Not the run.

4910
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:20,340
This is not the run.

4911
03:00:20,660 --> 03:00:21,300
I should have started the ship.

4912
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:22,300
I should have started the ship.

4913
03:00:22,780 --> 03:00:24,580
I should have started the ship!

4914
03:00:25,580 --> 03:00:26,920
Kill us all!

4915
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:28,340
I'm sorry!

4916
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:29,200
I'm sorry!

4917
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:30,860
No!

4918
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:32,840
I don't want to leave you guys.

4919
03:00:32,980 --> 03:00:32,980
I'm sorry.

4920
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:33,920
I'm sorry that's moving.

4921
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:36,900
They were everywhere.

4922
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:39,940
Pain.

4923
03:00:41,220 --> 03:00:41,740
Pain.

4924
03:00:42,840 --> 03:00:44,720
I owe Naki an apology.

4925
03:00:45,380 --> 03:00:45,940
I'm sorry, Naki.

4926
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:48,280
She killed me!

4927
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:50,800
I told you I was low in HP!

4928
03:00:51,400 --> 03:00:53,960
You should have helped me.

4929
03:00:54,040 --> 03:00:56,160
You helped me die.

4930
03:00:56,820 --> 03:00:58,440
What do we do?

4931
03:00:58,640 --> 03:00:59,780
What do we do?

4932
03:00:59,780 --> 03:01:00,200
What do we do?

4933
03:01:00,300 --> 03:01:01,800
Just feeling so...

4934
03:01:01,800 --> 03:01:02,720
It's a lie.

4935
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:02,720
It's a lie.

4936
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:04,480
I'm so sorry.

4937
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:05,600
I'm so sorry.

4938
03:01:08,820 --> 03:01:09,860
I'm so sorry.

4939
03:01:10,040 --> 03:01:10,560
I'm so sorry.

4940
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:10,660
I'm so sorry.

4941
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:10,700
Wait.

4942
03:01:10,780 --> 03:01:11,000
Rip.

4943
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:12,860
Well.

4944
03:01:12,980 --> 03:01:13,120
Rip.

4945
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:14,520
I'm so sorry.

4946
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:15,600
Ayaseba.

4947
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:17,260
I will never catch you again.

4948
03:01:17,460 --> 03:01:17,920
It's okay.

4949
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:18,580
I love you so much.

4950
03:01:18,580 --> 03:01:19,020
I'll trust you.

4951
03:01:19,440 --> 03:01:21,460
Wait, so what happened between you guys?

4952
03:01:22,540 --> 03:01:23,700
Ayaseba killed me!

4953
03:01:24,040 --> 03:01:24,560
What?

4954
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:26,600
She hit me!

4955
03:01:27,860 --> 03:01:29,560
Actually, I don't know what happened.

4956
03:01:29,680 --> 03:01:29,720
No!

4957
03:01:29,720 --> 03:01:32,080
Actually... I can explain.

4958
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:34,540
No, you don't need to explain.

4959
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:36,000
I get it.

4960
03:01:36,220 --> 03:01:36,940
I get it.

4961
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,260
Look at that gesture right now.

4962
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:41,880
Aww, she's just a minion.

4963
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:43,180
She's just a minion.

4964
03:01:43,800 --> 03:01:45,200
I'm just a minion.

4965
03:01:45,740 --> 03:01:47,340
It's time to kill her.

4966
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:49,080
Yeah.

4967
03:01:49,240 --> 03:01:50,220
No, no, no.

4968
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:51,120
No, no, no.

4969
03:01:51,220 --> 03:01:53,120
Okay, what happened was we both escaped.

4970
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:55,480
And then she left her sign.

4971
03:01:55,780 --> 03:01:58,100
And I was like, oh Naki, you're so silly.

4972
03:01:58,100 --> 03:01:59,620
And then I bonked her head.

4973
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:01,340
I bonked her head.

4974
03:02:01,640 --> 03:02:02,760
Just a little silly.

4975
03:02:03,180 --> 03:02:04,380
Just a little bonked her head.

4976
03:02:04,560 --> 03:02:06,420
Those signs were powerful.

4977
03:02:07,900 --> 03:02:08,960
Oh my god.

4978
03:02:10,260 --> 03:02:11,600
I thought it wouldn't kill you.

4979
03:02:11,600 --> 03:02:12,740
I didn't bonk, you know?

4980
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:14,000
No, it was the bug.

4981
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:15,900
I was low on HP.

4982
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,140
So I didn't want to go back in there.

4983
03:02:18,360 --> 03:02:21,260
I did the finishing touch, you know.

4984
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:22,640
See, because you guys were losing.

4985
03:02:22,860 --> 03:02:25,260
You guys threw me and you were close to the ship.

4986
03:02:25,400 --> 03:02:26,720
So I thought you'd make it back.

4987
03:02:26,860 --> 03:02:27,660
So I didn't like...

4988
03:02:28,100 --> 03:02:29,300
start the ship.

4989
03:02:29,840 --> 03:02:30,360
Yeah.

4990
03:02:30,860 --> 03:02:31,940
But no, you...

4991
03:02:31,940 --> 03:02:34,920
What happened though with you was so messed up.

4992
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:36,500
That shouldn't have happened.

4993
03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:38,340
Yeah, I should have not died.

4994
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,540
Because I was crouching the entire time.

4995
03:02:41,700 --> 03:02:43,060
Here, like this.

4996
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:45,880
And then the dog was clipping through the ship.

4997
03:02:46,060 --> 03:02:48,260
Yeah, and then it ate her.

4998
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:50,960
Yeah, like I don't even understand.

4999
03:02:51,620 --> 03:02:51,680
So stupid.

5000
03:02:51,680 --> 03:02:51,760
Yeah.

5001
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:53,840
I was safe, man.

5002
03:02:54,040 --> 03:02:55,040
Little whoopsie.

5003
03:02:55,280 --> 03:02:55,860
It's okay.

5004
03:02:56,020 --> 03:02:56,780
Let's just...

5005
03:02:56,780 --> 03:02:56,940
It's fine.

5006
03:02:56,940 --> 03:02:57,480
Let's just...

5007
03:02:57,480 --> 03:03:00,800
We can just like land and then take back off and die.

5008
03:03:00,940 --> 03:03:01,480
Oh my god.

5009
03:03:03,220 --> 03:03:04,100
I haven't...

5010
03:03:04,100 --> 03:03:05,680
I haven't seen the...

5011
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:05,820
Yeah.

5012
03:03:05,880 --> 03:03:07,920
The Knuckles face until now.

5013
03:03:09,680 --> 03:03:10,700
Do you know the way?

5014
03:03:10,860 --> 03:03:11,720
Are you looking?

5015
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:14,360
My face.

5016
03:03:14,520 --> 03:03:15,200
I don't know.

5017
03:03:16,200 --> 03:03:16,920
I don't know.

5018
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:18,380
You look like a very nerdy Knuckles.

5019
03:03:18,380 --> 03:03:18,740
Can you do the thing?

5020
03:03:18,900 --> 03:03:19,600
Can you say the thing?

5021
03:03:23,300 --> 03:03:24,320
I don't know.

5022
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:26,480
She doesn't know the way.

5023
03:03:28,140 --> 03:03:28,860
She doesn't...

5024
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:29,580
Do you know the way, Dayo?

5025
03:03:29,660 --> 03:03:31,000
She doesn't know the way, Dayo.

5026
03:03:31,020 --> 03:03:31,620
Do you know the way?

5027
03:03:32,820 --> 03:03:34,180
I'm not for you, Arasama.

5028
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:36,120
Oh, you're gonna write a Jackson console?

5029
03:03:36,360 --> 03:03:37,000
Oh, I don't know.

5030
03:03:37,240 --> 03:03:38,300
I'm not saying for you, Arasama.

5031
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:39,380
No way.

5032
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:42,040
Honestly, that means I would not respond.

5033
03:03:42,460 --> 03:03:45,240
I'm not responding to any requests from you, Arasama.

5034
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:46,280
Oh, but...

5035
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:47,820
You guys wanna like die or do you wanna like...

5036
03:03:47,820 --> 03:03:48,940
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

5037
03:03:48,940 --> 03:03:49,620
I'm just gonna die.

5038
03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:50,240
I'm just gonna...

5039
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:50,700
You're gonna die?

5040
03:03:50,820 --> 03:03:50,920
Okay.

5041
03:03:51,280 --> 03:03:51,640
Yeah.

5042
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:52,360
Yeah.

5043
03:03:52,500 --> 03:03:52,780
Let her die.

5044
03:03:52,780 --> 03:03:52,800
Let her die.

5045
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:53,000
There we go.

5046
03:03:53,400 --> 03:03:54,460
Let's just accept it.

5047
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:54,800
This run is gone.

5048
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:55,680
Yeah, basically.

5049
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:56,180
This run is gone.

5050
03:03:56,200 --> 03:03:56,920
This run is gone.

5051
03:03:56,920 --> 03:03:57,720
It's gone!

5052
03:03:57,840 --> 03:03:58,180
It's gone!

5053
03:04:01,720 --> 03:04:03,580
I'm going to...

5054
03:04:03,580 --> 03:04:03,940
Bye!

5055
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:09,600
How

5056
03:04:17,980 --> 03:04:18,460
did I live?

5057
03:04:18,500 --> 03:04:21,100
They spared

5058
03:04:25,540 --> 03:04:26,060
you.

5059
03:04:31,460 --> 03:04:36,820
You don't think that the dogs heard the metal gear music, right?

5060
03:04:37,980 --> 03:04:39,180
Did they?

5061
03:04:39,400 --> 03:04:40,520
I don't think so, right?

5062
03:04:41,400 --> 03:04:42,440
I have no idea.

5063
03:04:46,280 --> 03:04:46,800
Goodbye!

5064
03:05:04,360 --> 03:05:05,820
We are back.

5065
03:05:06,920 --> 03:05:07,440
This...

5066
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:09,640
This is the Ryan, everybody.

5067
03:05:10,340 --> 03:05:12,000
Maybe I shouldn't be...

5068
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:12,740
Yeah, maybe...

5069
03:05:12,740 --> 03:05:13,620
How are you guys feeling?

5070
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:14,380
Are you guys feeling okay?

5071
03:05:14,860 --> 03:05:15,960
Wait, why did I turn...

5072
03:05:15,960 --> 03:05:16,380
You guys feeling good?

5073
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:17,400
Yeah!

5074
03:05:18,900 --> 03:05:20,880
I'm feeling good as long as...

5075
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:22,480
As long as someone is like, you know...

5076
03:05:23,740 --> 03:05:25,200
I'm sorry, okay?

5077
03:05:25,560 --> 03:05:26,140
I'm sorry!

5078
03:05:26,980 --> 03:05:28,280
Trust has been lost.

5079
03:05:29,500 --> 03:05:30,780
I think we need therapy.

5080
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:33,140
I'm traumatized.

5081
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:35,060
Don't worry, I will...

5082
03:05:35,060 --> 03:05:36,680
I will redeem myself.

5083
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:37,920
I will redeem myself.

5084
03:05:37,920 --> 03:05:38,300
Emily!

5085
03:05:38,480 --> 03:05:39,400
Do you guys wanna have like a...

5086
03:05:39,400 --> 03:05:41,160
Do you guys wanna have like a painting session?

5087
03:05:41,280 --> 03:05:42,280
And you know, some therapy?

5088
03:05:42,380 --> 03:05:43,240
You know, cleanser?

5089
03:05:43,360 --> 03:05:43,800
Therapy?

5090
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:45,800
I wanna be my therapist, Emily.

5091
03:05:46,100 --> 03:05:46,600
Oh my god.

5092
03:05:46,960 --> 03:05:48,280
Let's see if we can get you.

5093
03:05:48,800 --> 03:05:49,420
I'll fix you.

5094
03:05:50,200 --> 03:05:51,900
Oh my god, you're gonna fix me!

5095
03:05:52,160 --> 03:05:52,480
Yeah!

5096
03:05:53,400 --> 03:05:54,160
She's perfect!

5097
03:05:54,640 --> 03:05:55,600
Did you fix me?

5098
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:58,620
She's perfect!

5099
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:00,520
Why don't you have like...

5100
03:06:00,520 --> 03:06:01,740
You can like dance together.

5101
03:06:01,900 --> 03:06:03,400
Like have like a little dance off.

5102
03:06:03,620 --> 03:06:04,420
And like, you know...

5103
03:06:04,420 --> 03:06:04,660
Alright.

5104
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:06,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

5105
03:06:06,400 --> 03:06:07,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5106
03:06:07,320 --> 03:06:07,600
Okay.

5107
03:06:07,700 --> 03:06:07,840
Oh!

5108
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:08,580
Oh!

5109
03:06:08,700 --> 03:06:09,080
Oh!

5110
03:06:09,220 --> 03:06:09,560
Oh!

5111
03:06:10,020 --> 03:06:10,180
Oh!

5112
03:06:10,180 --> 03:06:10,280
Oh!

5113
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:10,760
Oh!

5114
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:10,840
Oh!

5115
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:11,140
Oh!

5116
03:06:11,220 --> 03:06:11,240
Oh!

5117
03:06:11,240 --> 03:06:11,340
Oh!

5118
03:06:11,520 --> 03:06:11,560
Oh!

5119
03:06:11,560 --> 03:06:11,700
Oh!

5120
03:06:11,780 --> 03:06:11,900
Oh!

5121
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:12,460
Oh!

5122
03:06:12,460 --> 03:06:12,600
Oh!

5123
03:06:12,840 --> 03:06:13,220
Oh!

5124
03:06:13,220 --> 03:06:13,280
Oh!

5125
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:13,300
Oh!

5126
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:13,360
Oh!

5127
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:14,260
Oh!

5128
03:06:14,660 --> 03:06:15,020
Oh!

5129
03:06:15,020 --> 03:06:16,260
Yeah, yeah, gritty, gritty.

5130
03:06:16,340 --> 03:06:17,500
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

5131
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:18,380
Oh yeah, yeah!

5132
03:06:18,620 --> 03:06:19,560
Ooh, whoa, whoa!

5133
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:20,920
Gritty!

5134
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:21,860
Gritty, gritty!

5135
03:06:22,140 --> 03:06:22,960
Minion, gritty!

5136
03:06:23,660 --> 03:06:24,680
Kirby, gritty!

5137
03:06:25,080 --> 03:06:25,780
Oh yeah!

5138
03:06:26,200 --> 03:06:27,180
Twerking Luigi!

5139
03:06:28,480 --> 03:06:29,000
Yeah!

5140
03:06:40,480 --> 03:06:42,320
Oh my gosh, Naki!

5141
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:44,120
Oh, oh, I didn't mean to do that.

5142
03:06:45,340 --> 03:06:47,380
Oh, oh, are you saying something?

5143
03:06:47,600 --> 03:06:47,800
No.

5144
03:06:47,880 --> 03:06:48,620
I saw that.

5145
03:06:48,900 --> 03:06:51,200
I'm just trying to say something, alright?

5146
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:02,180
Are you putting your face in my butt?

5147
03:07:03,140 --> 03:07:05,320
I think I know why you die, Emery.

5148
03:07:05,420 --> 03:07:06,660
It's because you're dumpy.

5149
03:07:06,780 --> 03:07:09,100
I'm dumpy.

5150
03:07:09,860 --> 03:07:13,740
The sound of your ass cheek clapping is what alerted the dog.

5151
03:07:13,740 --> 03:07:14,820
Hey, that's mine!

5152
03:07:15,020 --> 03:07:15,200
Good job.

5153
03:07:19,140 --> 03:07:20,200
Let's go to Val.

5154
03:07:21,780 --> 03:07:22,180
Alright.

5155
03:07:22,580 --> 03:07:23,620
Here we go, guys.

5156
03:07:23,760 --> 03:07:24,340
This is it.

5157
03:07:25,100 --> 03:07:26,080
This is it.

5158
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:26,540
We got this.

5159
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:27,020
We got this.

5160
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:28,980
This is the run.

5161
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:29,300
Alright.

5162
03:07:29,560 --> 03:07:30,380
This is it.

5163
03:07:30,920 --> 03:07:33,380
This is the last time when I feel like we're in danger.

5164
03:07:35,640 --> 03:07:36,540
Start the ship.

5165
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:37,540
Let's go.

5166
03:07:38,800 --> 03:07:39,200
Yeah.

5167
03:07:39,400 --> 03:07:41,580
Next time I hear a dog, I will start the ship.

5168
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:42,940
I do not trust dogs anymore.

5169
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:43,880
Don't trust the dog.

5170
03:07:43,880 --> 03:07:44,660
Yeah, pretty much.

5171
03:07:44,680 --> 03:07:45,380
I do not trust them.

5172
03:07:45,480 --> 03:07:45,780
Yeah.

5173
03:07:45,880 --> 03:07:48,540
I will start the ship as soon as I see a dog here.

5174
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:52,020
Which way was it again?

5175
03:07:52,340 --> 03:07:53,200
Is it this way?

5176
03:07:54,120 --> 03:07:54,500
Maybe.

5177
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:58,160
Not this way.

5178
03:07:58,360 --> 03:07:59,000
Don't go this way.

5179
03:07:59,080 --> 03:07:59,760
It's that way.

5180
03:08:00,480 --> 03:08:01,260
Don't go that way.

5181
03:08:01,280 --> 03:08:01,440
Come back.

5182
03:08:01,560 --> 03:08:01,780
Come back.

5183
03:08:01,840 --> 03:08:02,180
Come back.

5184
03:08:02,260 --> 03:08:03,000
I think it's...

5185
03:08:03,880 --> 03:08:04,720
I don't remember.

5186
03:08:05,060 --> 03:08:06,080
It's the one with the bridge, right?

5187
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:06,920
Maybe it's there.

5188
03:08:07,980 --> 03:08:08,500
This way?

5189
03:08:09,280 --> 03:08:09,660
Wait.

5190
03:08:09,780 --> 03:08:10,800
No, not that way.

5191
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:11,120
Nope.

5192
03:08:12,380 --> 03:08:12,740
It's...

5193
03:08:14,160 --> 03:08:14,800
I'm lost.

5194
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:16,040
Over here.

5195
03:08:16,180 --> 03:08:16,840
I have no idea.

5196
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:18,980
I think it's...

5197
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:20,900
Where is it?

5198
03:08:22,780 --> 03:08:23,580
Oh, it's here.

5199
03:08:23,660 --> 03:08:23,880
It's here.

5200
03:08:23,940 --> 03:08:24,540
Watch out, though.

5201
03:08:24,580 --> 03:08:24,920
Watch out.

5202
03:08:25,020 --> 03:08:25,380
Over here.

5203
03:08:25,380 --> 03:08:26,100
There's a beehive.

5204
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:26,320
Yeah.

5205
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:27,960
There's a beehive right next to it.

5206
03:08:28,120 --> 03:08:30,140
That's a terrible place for beehives.

5207
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:30,440
My God.

5208
03:08:30,640 --> 03:08:30,860
Whoa.

5209
03:08:30,860 --> 03:08:31,140
Whoa.

5210
03:08:31,140 --> 03:08:31,300
Whoa.

5211
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:31,500
Whoa.

5212
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:32,220
Wait.

5213
03:08:34,880 --> 03:08:36,420
We can just go to the other bridge.

5214
03:08:36,480 --> 03:08:37,620
We can just go to the other bridge.

5215
03:08:38,020 --> 03:08:38,380
Yeah.

5216
03:08:38,640 --> 03:08:39,160
Oh, yeah.

5217
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:39,640
Over here.

5218
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:39,960
Over here.

5219
03:08:40,060 --> 03:08:40,420
Yeah.

5220
03:08:40,420 --> 03:08:41,000
That's the one.

5221
03:08:41,160 --> 03:08:41,560
Yeah.

5222
03:08:41,720 --> 03:08:42,360
All right.

5223
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:43,220
I'll go on it.

5224
03:08:43,700 --> 03:08:44,220
Go.

5225
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:44,700
Go.

5226
03:08:44,900 --> 03:08:45,080
Go.

5227
03:08:50,820 --> 03:08:51,340
Okay.

5228
03:08:52,600 --> 03:08:53,220
We're good.

5229
03:08:54,500 --> 03:08:55,360
We're fine.

5230
03:08:57,540 --> 03:08:58,760
Little bunny hopping.

5231
03:08:59,460 --> 03:09:00,060
Let's go.

5232
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:05,440
Intrusive thoughts, because I also was on it.

5233
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:06,660
What?

5234
03:09:08,280 --> 03:09:09,760
She's really down to you now.

5235
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:10,080
Let's go.

5236
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:10,400
Okay.

5237
03:09:10,420 --> 03:09:10,600
Oh, guys.

5238
03:09:12,180 --> 03:09:12,660
Nice.

5239
03:09:15,340 --> 03:09:15,820
No.

5240
03:09:16,160 --> 03:09:17,500
Was it worth it?

5241
03:09:17,780 --> 03:09:17,820
No.

5242
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:20,680
Was it worth it?

5243
03:09:20,700 --> 03:09:21,080
No.

5244
03:09:22,020 --> 03:09:23,380
Was it worth it?

5245
03:09:23,380 --> 03:09:23,620
No.

5246
03:09:24,820 --> 03:09:25,500
Betraying her.

5247
03:09:26,240 --> 03:09:27,460
Losing all the...

5248
03:09:27,460 --> 03:09:28,160
Oh, present.

5249
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:29,340
Oh, gotcha.

5250
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:32,000
I like how you dropped it.

5251
03:09:32,060 --> 03:09:33,860
That's as fast as you could just grab it.

5252
03:09:34,040 --> 03:09:34,760
Oh, nice.

5253
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:35,480
Yay.

5254
03:09:35,900 --> 03:09:36,380
Okay.

5255
03:09:36,520 --> 03:09:38,080
So far, our gotcha rate's been good.

5256
03:09:38,220 --> 03:09:38,460
Yeah.

5257
03:09:38,460 --> 03:09:38,860
So far.

5258
03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:39,200
Good.

5259
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:39,460
Good.

5260
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:40,400
I didn't see how you dropped it.

5261
03:09:40,400 --> 03:09:41,420
I didn't see how much it was worth, though.

5262
03:09:41,960 --> 03:09:42,400
Hmm.

5263
03:09:43,280 --> 03:09:45,860
I mean, assuming a lot is worth, maybe it's just not working.

5264
03:09:48,420 --> 03:09:48,860
Hmm.

5265
03:09:49,400 --> 03:09:50,940
But I think it's pretty exciting, anyway.

5266
03:09:51,020 --> 03:09:51,640
I'm gonna keep it...

5267
03:09:51,640 --> 03:09:52,060
Put it outside?

5268
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:52,840
Oh.

5269
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:55,060
Yeah, I'm gonna drop this, too.

5270
03:09:55,720 --> 03:09:56,160
Damn.

5271
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:56,800
Nice.

5272
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:57,180
Okay.

5273
03:09:58,460 --> 03:09:58,900
Loose.

5274
03:09:59,020 --> 03:09:59,600
Here, guys.

5275
03:09:59,940 --> 03:10:00,380
Hello.

5276
03:10:00,420 --> 03:10:00,760
Hello.

5277
03:10:01,280 --> 03:10:01,880
What's wrong?

5278
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:04,400
I thought we had something together.

5279
03:10:04,780 --> 03:10:05,220
Nice.

5280
03:10:05,420 --> 03:10:05,860
Huh?

5281
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:06,760
What happened?

5282
03:10:08,520 --> 03:10:08,960
Hello?

5283
03:10:09,400 --> 03:10:09,840
Hello?

5284
03:10:09,940 --> 03:10:10,380
Hello?

5285
03:10:10,400 --> 03:10:11,200
It's not here, right?

5286
03:10:11,460 --> 03:10:11,800
Oh, it might be the other way.

5287
03:10:11,900 --> 03:10:13,240
It might be the other way.

5288
03:10:13,440 --> 03:10:13,700
Hmm.

5289
03:10:13,900 --> 03:10:14,680
Oh, the other way?

5290
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:16,200
Oh, but there's here, too.

5291
03:10:17,100 --> 03:10:17,580
Oh.

5292
03:10:17,700 --> 03:10:18,520
The apparatus.

5293
03:10:18,860 --> 03:10:19,720
We'll have to grab it later.

5294
03:10:19,960 --> 03:10:20,660
Oh, yeah.

5295
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:23,360
Over here?

5296
03:10:23,480 --> 03:10:23,880
Nothing?

5297
03:10:24,060 --> 03:10:24,440
Hmm.

5298
03:10:25,460 --> 03:10:25,880
Okay.

5299
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:28,920
There's a dead end.

5300
03:10:30,840 --> 03:10:32,220
I hate dead ends.

5301
03:10:32,300 --> 03:10:33,280
I don't have anything as well.

5302
03:10:33,480 --> 03:10:34,680
Oh, we're back here.

5303
03:10:34,900 --> 03:10:35,300
Oh, hello.

5304
03:10:35,540 --> 03:10:35,800
I hear them.

5305
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:37,820
Are we taking the apparatus?

5306
03:10:37,860 --> 03:10:38,200
Hello.

5307
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:38,600
Hello.

5308
03:10:39,860 --> 03:10:40,340
Hello.

5309
03:10:40,400 --> 03:10:40,920
Oh, gross.

5310
03:10:40,940 --> 03:10:41,660
Here we bug.

5311
03:10:42,720 --> 03:10:43,320
Why don't...

5312
03:10:43,320 --> 03:10:44,080
Do we want to...

5313
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:44,560
Ah!

5314
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:45,800
Yippee!

5315
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:47,220
Wee!

5316
03:10:47,900 --> 03:10:48,300
Yippee!

5317
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:48,960
Nope.

5318
03:10:49,060 --> 03:10:50,020
I didn't get anything.

5319
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:50,360
What?

5320
03:10:50,380 --> 03:10:50,520
Oh.

5321
03:10:50,860 --> 03:10:52,740
Let's go through the fire exit instead.

5322
03:10:53,420 --> 03:10:53,460
Yippee!

5323
03:10:56,900 --> 03:10:57,640
Let's do that.

5324
03:10:57,740 --> 03:10:57,900
Yeah.

5325
03:10:58,220 --> 03:10:58,340
Yeah.

5326
03:10:58,340 --> 03:10:59,280
Let's try the fire exit.

5327
03:10:59,420 --> 03:11:00,740
Do you want to carry this back or leave it here?

5328
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:01,480
No.

5329
03:11:01,740 --> 03:11:03,160
I think we should carry it back.

5330
03:11:03,160 --> 03:11:03,400
Yeah.

5331
03:11:03,400 --> 03:11:04,100
I think so, too.

5332
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:04,940
Carry it back.

5333
03:11:04,940 --> 03:11:05,140
Okay.

5334
03:11:05,140 --> 03:11:05,360
Okay.

5335
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:07,660
I think the people can hold everything.

5336
03:11:07,800 --> 03:11:08,200
Yippee!

5337
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:08,480
Yeah.

5338
03:11:08,660 --> 03:11:09,660
Two people can hold everything.

5339
03:11:10,400 --> 03:11:10,980
Two people can go back.

5340
03:11:11,020 --> 03:11:11,320
No.

5341
03:11:11,400 --> 03:11:11,940
Drop that.

5342
03:11:11,940 --> 03:11:12,660
Drop that Naki.

5343
03:11:12,820 --> 03:11:13,980
And then pick up that first.

5344
03:11:14,060 --> 03:11:14,240
Yeah.

5345
03:11:14,360 --> 03:11:15,280
There you go.

5346
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:15,600
There you go.

5347
03:11:15,620 --> 03:11:15,860
All right.

5348
03:11:15,900 --> 03:11:16,720
I'll go back with Naki.

5349
03:11:16,820 --> 03:11:17,060
Okay.

5350
03:11:17,380 --> 03:11:18,780
I'm going to fire exit.

5351
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:19,940
Let's go.

5352
03:11:21,060 --> 03:11:21,420
Okay.

5353
03:11:21,660 --> 03:11:22,160
All right.

5354
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:22,800
Just kind of...

5355
03:11:22,800 --> 03:11:24,600
Just kind of slide down.

5356
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:25,260
Yeah.

5357
03:11:25,340 --> 03:11:25,700
Slide.

5358
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:26,000
Yeah.

5359
03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:27,160
Slide.

5360
03:11:27,620 --> 03:11:27,980
Wee!

5361
03:11:30,120 --> 03:11:30,480
Wee!

5362
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:33,380
I hope there's no things here.

5363
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:37,280
Oh.

5364
03:11:38,200 --> 03:11:38,560
Oh.

5365
03:11:38,660 --> 03:11:39,140
Hard door?

5366
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:40,120
Oh.

5367
03:11:40,120 --> 03:11:40,900
I think there's something over there.

5368
03:11:40,920 --> 03:11:41,880
I think he's on the other side.

5369
03:11:43,420 --> 03:11:43,820
Haha.

5370
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:45,280
Dummy.

5371
03:11:45,840 --> 03:11:46,240
Wait.

5372
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:46,920
There's a hairbrush?

5373
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:47,840
Somewhere?

5374
03:11:48,400 --> 03:11:49,060
Where is it?

5375
03:11:49,860 --> 03:11:50,600
Did you get it?

5376
03:11:50,740 --> 03:11:51,880
I scanned the hairbrush somewhere.

5377
03:11:53,380 --> 03:11:54,340
Where is it?

5378
03:11:54,620 --> 03:11:55,480
One hairbrush?

5379
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:57,440
Oh.

5380
03:11:57,500 --> 03:11:58,220
Where is it?

5381
03:11:58,320 --> 03:11:59,160
You see it?

5382
03:11:59,180 --> 03:11:59,720
Do you see it, too?

5383
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:01,160
No.

5384
03:12:03,620 --> 03:12:04,020
Oh.

5385
03:12:04,040 --> 03:12:05,100
There's a hairbrush over here.

5386
03:12:05,260 --> 03:12:05,800
It's on top.

5387
03:12:06,080 --> 03:12:06,260
Oh.

5388
03:12:06,260 --> 03:12:06,720
It's on top.

5389
03:12:07,920 --> 03:12:08,320
Yeah.

5390
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:09,240
Nice.

5391
03:12:09,700 --> 03:12:10,100
Nice.

5392
03:12:10,100 --> 03:12:10,800
I got it.

5393
03:12:11,080 --> 03:12:12,080
I'm gonna open this.

5394
03:12:12,480 --> 03:12:12,920
Oh.

5395
03:12:13,420 --> 03:12:14,320
There's some bottles.

5396
03:12:16,060 --> 03:12:16,500
Yeah.

5397
03:12:16,840 --> 03:12:17,880
We can grab that.

5398
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:18,160
Wait.

5399
03:12:18,220 --> 03:12:19,400
I can't tell if that was them or not.

5400
03:12:27,930 --> 03:12:29,310
This is a big area.

5401
03:12:29,850 --> 03:12:30,290
Hmm.

5402
03:12:31,070 --> 03:12:31,510
Oh.

5403
03:12:31,590 --> 03:12:32,370
There should be something here.

5404
03:12:32,410 --> 03:12:33,010
There's an engine.

5405
03:12:33,270 --> 03:12:33,430
Oh.

5406
03:12:35,610 --> 03:12:36,050
Yeah.

5407
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:39,490
Maybe save the bigger stuff for later.

5408
03:12:40,970 --> 03:12:42,090
This area is huge.

5409
03:12:42,350 --> 03:12:42,570
Yeah.

5410
03:12:42,950 --> 03:12:43,390
Yeah.

5411
03:12:43,390 --> 03:12:43,470
Yeah.

5412
03:12:43,470 --> 03:12:43,490
Okay.

5413
03:12:43,490 --> 03:12:43,890
I'm scanning.

5414
03:12:45,330 --> 03:12:45,690
Wait.

5415
03:12:45,830 --> 03:12:46,190
Okay.

5416
03:12:46,310 --> 03:12:47,330
This is finally a dead end.

5417
03:12:47,490 --> 03:12:47,690
Oh.

5418
03:12:48,010 --> 03:12:48,370
Okay.

5419
03:12:49,030 --> 03:12:49,390
Okay.

5420
03:12:49,410 --> 03:12:50,570
Then there's no other way.

5421
03:12:50,710 --> 03:12:51,450
You have to go back.

5422
03:12:51,630 --> 03:12:51,910
Yeah.

5423
03:12:51,950 --> 03:12:52,190
Wait.

5424
03:12:52,310 --> 03:12:52,590
Oh.

5425
03:12:52,770 --> 03:12:52,970
No.

5426
03:12:53,050 --> 03:12:53,190
Yeah.

5427
03:12:53,250 --> 03:12:53,690
No other way.

5428
03:12:54,810 --> 03:12:55,170
Okay.

5429
03:12:56,210 --> 03:12:56,710
I'm here.

5430
03:12:58,090 --> 03:12:58,450
Yeah.

5431
03:12:59,730 --> 03:13:00,270
There's the...

5432
03:13:00,270 --> 03:13:00,410
Oh.

5433
03:13:00,410 --> 03:13:00,770
There's something.

5434
03:13:00,930 --> 03:13:01,170
Yeah.

5435
03:13:01,170 --> 03:13:01,750
There's the engine.

5436
03:13:03,550 --> 03:13:03,910
Oh.

5437
03:13:03,970 --> 03:13:04,670
And there's a key, too.

5438
03:13:04,970 --> 03:13:07,490
This is where I died earlier.

5439
03:13:09,670 --> 03:13:10,570
I got it.

5440
03:13:10,990 --> 03:13:12,010
I'll get the engine.

5441
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:12,530
Okay.

5442
03:13:13,710 --> 03:13:14,570
I have it.

5443
03:13:14,630 --> 03:13:14,850
Nice.

5444
03:13:14,970 --> 03:13:15,450
You can go back.

5445
03:13:15,530 --> 03:13:15,810
Maybe.

5446
03:13:17,530 --> 03:13:18,310
Is this the way back?

5447
03:13:18,590 --> 03:13:18,950
Yeah.

5448
03:13:18,990 --> 03:13:19,930
This is the way back.

5449
03:13:20,710 --> 03:13:21,290
All right.

5450
03:13:21,590 --> 03:13:23,010
And there's also this way, too.

5451
03:13:24,070 --> 03:13:24,430
Hmm.

5452
03:13:25,570 --> 03:13:25,930
Good.

5453
03:13:25,930 --> 03:13:26,850
Did we go here?

5454
03:13:26,850 --> 03:13:27,470
I'm gonna check it.

5455
03:13:27,510 --> 03:13:27,790
No.

5456
03:13:27,910 --> 03:13:29,130
We haven't gone here yet.

5457
03:13:29,310 --> 03:13:30,470
Let's check it out just a little bit.

5458
03:13:30,530 --> 03:13:30,750
All right.

5459
03:13:31,590 --> 03:13:33,090
And it's a dead end.

5460
03:13:33,130 --> 03:13:33,710
Dead end.

5461
03:13:34,090 --> 03:13:34,450
Dead end.

5462
03:13:34,590 --> 03:13:35,250
Dead end.

5463
03:13:35,690 --> 03:13:36,870
We're not gonna die, guys.

5464
03:13:36,890 --> 03:13:37,310
We're good.

5465
03:13:39,770 --> 03:13:40,130
Yeah.

5466
03:13:40,230 --> 03:13:40,910
I have a hairbrush.

5467
03:13:41,330 --> 03:13:41,690
Yeah.

5468
03:13:41,790 --> 03:13:43,230
I can protect you with a hairbrush.

5469
03:13:43,230 --> 03:13:43,450
Yeah.

5470
03:13:43,470 --> 03:13:45,330
You're gonna style me.

5471
03:13:46,230 --> 03:13:46,670
Oh.

5472
03:13:46,810 --> 03:13:47,730
There's an egg beater.

5473
03:13:49,350 --> 03:13:49,990
Did we...

5474
03:13:49,990 --> 03:13:50,290
Wait.

5475
03:13:50,370 --> 03:13:51,010
Did we come this way?

5476
03:13:52,590 --> 03:13:53,030
Wait.

5477
03:13:53,610 --> 03:13:54,050
Upstairs.

5478
03:13:54,090 --> 03:13:54,470
Upstairs.

5479
03:13:54,570 --> 03:13:55,010
Upstairs.

5480
03:13:55,010 --> 03:13:55,110
Upstairs.

5481
03:13:55,110 --> 03:13:55,310
Right?

5482
03:13:55,490 --> 03:13:55,710
Yeah.

5483
03:13:56,270 --> 03:13:56,710
Yeah.

5484
03:13:56,750 --> 03:13:56,910
Yeah.

5485
03:13:57,370 --> 03:13:57,810
No.

5486
03:13:58,450 --> 03:13:58,890
Wait.

5487
03:13:58,970 --> 03:13:59,130
Oh.

5488
03:13:59,290 --> 03:13:59,670
No.

5489
03:14:00,130 --> 03:14:00,570
Wait.

5490
03:14:00,770 --> 03:14:01,050
Wait.

5491
03:14:01,210 --> 03:14:03,810
Over here.

5492
03:14:03,890 --> 03:14:04,290
Over here.

5493
03:14:04,430 --> 03:14:04,830
This way?

5494
03:14:05,790 --> 03:14:06,230
Oh.

5495
03:14:06,250 --> 03:14:06,930
It's not here.

5496
03:14:07,930 --> 03:14:08,850
It's a dead end.

5497
03:14:10,190 --> 03:14:10,630
Wait.

5498
03:14:13,380 --> 03:14:13,820
Yeah.

5499
03:14:13,820 --> 03:14:15,000
I think this is the wrong way.

5500
03:14:15,380 --> 03:14:16,700
I think it's on the other side.

5501
03:14:17,020 --> 03:14:17,480
Is it...

5502
03:14:17,480 --> 03:14:18,000
Other side?

5503
03:14:18,300 --> 03:14:18,620
Okay.

5504
03:14:18,940 --> 03:14:19,260
Okay.

5505
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:19,440
Yeah.

5506
03:14:19,500 --> 03:14:19,620
Yeah.

5507
03:14:19,680 --> 03:14:20,200
Other side.

5508
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:21,160
Okay.

5509
03:14:21,440 --> 03:14:21,760
Wait.

5510
03:14:21,860 --> 03:14:22,400
It's not this...

5511
03:14:22,400 --> 03:14:23,060
Right here, right?

5512
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:24,520
Maybe it's here?

5513
03:14:24,720 --> 03:14:25,020
Yeah.

5514
03:14:25,040 --> 03:14:26,480
This is the one with the...

5515
03:14:27,260 --> 03:14:27,920
Did we go here?

5516
03:14:29,480 --> 03:14:29,800
Yeah.

5517
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:30,060
We went here.

5518
03:14:30,060 --> 03:14:30,140
Oh.

5519
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:30,320
Yeah.

5520
03:14:30,400 --> 03:14:30,840
We went here.

5521
03:14:30,960 --> 03:14:31,280
Yeah.

5522
03:14:31,360 --> 03:14:31,520
Yeah.

5523
03:14:31,560 --> 03:14:31,620
Yeah.

5524
03:14:33,080 --> 03:14:33,400
Okay.

5525
03:14:33,500 --> 03:14:34,980
We should cross to the other side.

5526
03:14:35,200 --> 03:14:35,960
Right over here.

5527
03:14:35,960 --> 03:14:36,680
Oh.

5528
03:14:38,720 --> 03:14:39,080
Um...

5529
03:14:39,080 --> 03:14:39,440
Wait.

5530
03:14:39,560 --> 03:14:40,120
How do we get...

5531
03:14:40,120 --> 03:14:40,160
Here?

5532
03:14:40,180 --> 03:14:40,540
Here?

5533
03:14:40,660 --> 03:14:40,800
Yeah.

5534
03:14:40,900 --> 03:14:42,580
You go up and then you can go across.

5535
03:14:43,580 --> 03:14:43,940
Wait.

5536
03:14:43,940 --> 03:14:44,300
So...

5537
03:14:44,900 --> 03:14:45,320
Oh, wait.

5538
03:14:45,460 --> 03:14:46,700
We came from over here, right?

5539
03:14:48,260 --> 03:14:48,620
Oh.

5540
03:14:50,200 --> 03:14:51,080
I don't remember.

5541
03:14:51,260 --> 03:14:51,840
I think it was here.

5542
03:14:55,100 --> 03:14:55,460
Yeah.

5543
03:14:56,020 --> 03:14:56,560
Oh, yeah.

5544
03:14:56,600 --> 03:14:57,120
Because the thumper.

5545
03:14:57,180 --> 03:14:57,660
I can hear him.

5546
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:00,120
Oh.

5547
03:15:00,260 --> 03:15:00,620
Yeah.

5548
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:02,460
And it was downstairs?

5549
03:15:02,860 --> 03:15:03,080
Yeah.

5550
03:15:03,140 --> 03:15:03,420
Okay.

5551
03:15:04,500 --> 03:15:04,860
Okay.

5552
03:15:05,580 --> 03:15:05,940
Okay.

5553
03:15:05,940 --> 03:15:06,180
And then the fire dort...

5554
03:15:06,180 --> 03:15:06,300
Right here.

5555
03:15:06,460 --> 03:15:06,660
Right here.

5556
03:15:06,680 --> 03:15:06,960
Right here.

5557
03:15:06,960 --> 03:15:07,500
And the fire...

5558
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:07,940
There we go.

5559
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:08,340
There we go.

5560
03:15:09,220 --> 03:15:09,580
Oh.

5561
03:15:10,400 --> 03:15:11,240
It's 6 PM.

5562
03:15:11,700 --> 03:15:12,060
Oh!

5563
03:15:12,820 --> 03:15:13,280
Uh oh.

5564
03:15:13,380 --> 03:15:14,420
Is it following us?

5565
03:15:14,600 --> 03:15:14,860
No.

5566
03:15:14,920 --> 03:15:15,820
That's the giant.

5567
03:15:15,900 --> 03:15:16,560
We gotta go.

5568
03:15:17,460 --> 03:15:17,820
Oh.

5569
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:18,360
No.

5570
03:15:18,620 --> 03:15:19,600
We gotta go.

5571
03:15:21,060 --> 03:15:21,640
Uh oh.

5572
03:15:21,660 --> 03:15:22,540
We gotta make a run.

5573
03:15:22,600 --> 03:15:22,860
Oh.

5574
03:15:22,980 --> 03:15:23,280
Oh gosh.

5575
03:15:23,320 --> 03:15:23,820
Oh gosh.

5576
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:24,240
Oh gosh.

5577
03:15:24,320 --> 03:15:24,540
Oh gosh.

5578
03:15:24,560 --> 03:15:24,720
Oh gosh.

5579
03:15:25,240 --> 03:15:25,600
Oh no.

5580
03:15:25,980 --> 03:15:26,180
No.

5581
03:15:26,180 --> 03:15:27,600
No, no, no, no, no...

5582
03:15:28,340 --> 03:15:29,480
Oh, there's a...

5583
03:15:29,480 --> 03:15:30,720
Another beehive, okay.

5584
03:15:32,880 --> 03:15:34,180
Alright, follow me.

5585
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:35,900
Way back...

5586
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:39,580
It's only seven.

5587
03:15:40,280 --> 03:15:41,560
There's already a giant out.

5588
03:15:42,860 --> 03:15:43,480
Uh-oh.

5589
03:15:43,700 --> 03:15:44,440
Oh god.

5590
03:15:44,480 --> 03:15:45,040
It's over here.

5591
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:45,520
Where?

5592
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:48,500
Right here, the ship.

5593
03:15:48,880 --> 03:15:50,960
Oh god, the giant saw me, I think.

5594
03:15:51,160 --> 03:15:51,820
Oh, oh, oh.

5595
03:15:52,900 --> 03:15:53,840
I think I'm dead!

5596
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:55,960
Wait, I found the ship!

5597
03:15:56,060 --> 03:15:56,120
No!

5598
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:03,460
Caught him!

5599
03:16:03,620 --> 03:16:03,980
Caught him!

5600
03:16:04,900 --> 03:16:05,960
My hands are full!

5601
03:16:07,020 --> 03:16:07,840
Start the ship!

5602
03:16:07,980 --> 03:16:08,800
Start the ship!

5603
03:16:08,940 --> 03:16:09,320
Start the ship!

5604
03:16:13,380 --> 03:16:14,060
Where's Naki?

5605
03:16:14,760 --> 03:16:15,680
I think she died.

5606
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:19,060
Oh, she's...

5607
03:16:19,060 --> 03:16:20,660
She's just not on the screen.

5608
03:16:20,980 --> 03:16:21,740
Where'd she go?

5609
03:16:21,800 --> 03:16:23,400
She wasn't real.

5610
03:16:25,300 --> 03:16:26,120
We heard her!

5611
03:16:26,200 --> 03:16:26,740
We heard her!

5612
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:28,100
Oh, it wasn't her then.

5613
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:29,120
You did?

5614
03:16:29,640 --> 03:16:29,940
I did.

5615
03:16:30,240 --> 03:16:31,260
Oh, I heard her.

5616
03:16:31,700 --> 03:16:33,700
It must have been the thumper, I think.

5617
03:16:34,260 --> 03:16:34,740
Yeah.

5618
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:37,520
Ah!

5619
03:16:38,800 --> 03:16:40,180
I thought you guys made it back.

5620
03:16:40,480 --> 03:16:41,560
Oh, the giant got you.

5621
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:44,080
Yeah, that's what I thought.

5622
03:16:44,340 --> 03:16:46,220
Oh, that's why you weren't on the screen.

5623
03:16:48,140 --> 03:16:49,660
But we're at quota.

5624
03:16:49,960 --> 03:16:50,620
We're at quota.

5625
03:16:51,420 --> 03:16:53,000
We still got two days.

5626
03:16:53,900 --> 03:16:54,380
Okay.

5627
03:16:55,300 --> 03:16:55,440
Let's see.

5628
03:16:56,180 --> 03:16:58,900
How much money do we need to go to a moon?

5629
03:16:59,140 --> 03:17:01,620
We need 600, I'm pretty sure.

5630
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:03,400
Oh my gosh, that's a lot of money.

5631
03:17:03,420 --> 03:17:03,920
That's expensive.

5632
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:06,280
Yeah, I don't think we can make it.

5633
03:17:06,580 --> 03:17:08,860
I don't know, it'd be like...

5634
03:17:09,320 --> 03:17:11,260
Oh wait, rend is 550.

5635
03:17:11,840 --> 03:17:11,940
We can.

5636
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:20,400
That seems more doable if we get the same amount of loot again.

5637
03:17:21,020 --> 03:17:21,660
Yeah, maybe.

5638
03:17:22,320 --> 03:17:22,880
Okay.

5639
03:17:23,860 --> 03:17:24,940
Let's do...

5640
03:17:26,260 --> 03:17:26,820
Assurance.

5641
03:17:28,940 --> 03:17:29,500
Okay.

5642
03:17:29,800 --> 03:17:30,360
Confirm.

5643
03:17:30,900 --> 03:17:31,620
And go.

5644
03:17:32,460 --> 03:17:33,020
Yeah!

5645
03:17:34,240 --> 03:17:35,260
Good run, good run.

5646
03:17:37,460 --> 03:17:38,840
Let's go guys, let's go.

5647
03:17:39,340 --> 03:17:40,660
Just gotta keep it up.

5648
03:17:40,900 --> 03:17:41,880
Keep it up.

5649
03:17:42,700 --> 03:17:44,140
Alright, I'm landing.

5650
03:17:47,280 --> 03:17:49,720
Mansion is on rend or dine?

5651
03:17:49,900 --> 03:17:50,600
Oh, okay.

5652
03:17:51,660 --> 03:17:53,140
So we have to go to rend or dine though.

5653
03:17:53,280 --> 03:17:53,560
Okay.

5654
03:17:56,580 --> 03:17:57,540
It's probably the...

5655
03:17:57,540 --> 03:17:58,560
The voices.

5656
03:17:59,280 --> 03:17:59,680
Yeah.

5657
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:02,680
And then load the kind of glitches it did.

5658
03:18:03,060 --> 03:18:03,720
Wait, so...

5659
03:18:06,020 --> 03:18:06,420
Okay.

5660
03:18:06,940 --> 03:18:08,540
Rend is 550.

5661
03:18:08,860 --> 03:18:10,040
Oh, so we could go to rend, right?

5662
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:13,260
Okay, so we just need more money.

5663
03:18:13,560 --> 03:18:14,480
Yeah, we just need...

5664
03:18:15,080 --> 03:18:15,480
Wahoo!

5665
03:18:17,140 --> 03:18:18,440
That's easy for us.

5666
03:18:18,860 --> 03:18:19,260
Yeah!

5667
03:18:22,140 --> 03:18:23,200
Let's find the pipe.

5668
03:18:23,640 --> 03:18:25,280
Over, over, over, over.

5669
03:18:25,300 --> 03:18:25,720
Pipe.

5670
03:18:25,780 --> 03:18:26,860
Oh, it's over here.

5671
03:18:27,140 --> 03:18:28,020
In entrance.

5672
03:18:28,240 --> 03:18:28,680
There we go.

5673
03:18:29,160 --> 03:18:30,340
Oh yeah, you're right.

5674
03:18:30,480 --> 03:18:32,020
Just slide on down.

5675
03:18:36,920 --> 03:18:37,720
We got this.

5676
03:18:39,380 --> 03:18:40,080
Hello, Mint.

5677
03:18:40,180 --> 03:18:41,060
That was fast.

5678
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:44,220
We're geniuses!

5679
03:18:45,320 --> 03:18:46,280
We're geniuses!

5680
03:18:46,820 --> 03:18:48,640
I don't remember the...

5681
03:18:48,640 --> 03:18:49,300
Yeah.

5682
03:18:50,960 --> 03:18:51,800
What is that?

5683
03:18:53,060 --> 03:18:53,540
Oh.

5684
03:18:54,280 --> 03:18:54,760
Is that a turret?

5685
03:18:55,760 --> 03:18:57,240
You guys, I think...

5686
03:18:57,240 --> 03:18:59,240
I think those are two...

5687
03:18:59,240 --> 03:19:00,920
I think those are two turrets.

5688
03:19:01,520 --> 03:19:02,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5689
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:02,940
I'll show you.

5690
03:19:03,240 --> 03:19:03,900
There's two of them.

5691
03:19:05,720 --> 03:19:06,120
So...

5692
03:19:08,140 --> 03:19:09,040
I'm gonna go this way.

5693
03:19:10,100 --> 03:19:10,500
Oh!

5694
03:19:11,940 --> 03:19:12,340
Yeah.

5695
03:19:15,140 --> 03:19:15,540
Nice.

5696
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:16,620
Oh, there's one more here.

5697
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:17,580
Oh, nice.

5698
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:19,220
Oh my god, we're smart.

5699
03:19:19,220 --> 03:19:19,400
We're smart.

5700
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:22,980
And there's nothing else here?

5701
03:19:22,980 --> 03:19:25,940
We honestly could just take a few things here and then dip.

5702
03:19:26,180 --> 03:19:26,980
There's nothing.

5703
03:19:27,560 --> 03:19:27,960
Yeah.

5704
03:19:28,200 --> 03:19:29,260
There's nothing here.

5705
03:19:30,760 --> 03:19:31,840
We can go down.

5706
03:19:32,080 --> 03:19:33,180
Yeah, we can go down.

5707
03:19:33,740 --> 03:19:34,640
Just be careful.

5708
03:19:36,820 --> 03:19:38,540
Oh, I didn't drop the hairbrush.

5709
03:19:40,500 --> 03:19:40,900
Oh.

5710
03:19:43,100 --> 03:19:44,640
I don't think it's worth it.

5711
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:45,820
Oh, I'm stuck.

5712
03:19:45,820 --> 03:19:46,120
Yeah.

5713
03:19:47,780 --> 03:19:49,720
I don't think...

5714
03:19:49,720 --> 03:19:50,320
I don't think.

5715
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:51,260
It's worth it.

5716
03:19:51,440 --> 03:19:52,440
Are you guys going back?

5717
03:19:54,400 --> 03:19:55,360
Um, maybe.

5718
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:56,080
There's nothing.

5719
03:19:56,440 --> 03:19:58,420
I'm gonna go the other way.

5720
03:19:59,020 --> 03:19:59,940
Oh, no, no.

5721
03:19:59,940 --> 03:20:00,500
I think...

5722
03:20:00,500 --> 03:20:02,040
There's not much there.

5723
03:20:02,080 --> 03:20:03,140
Yeah, there's nothing.

5724
03:20:03,260 --> 03:20:04,680
We grabbed everything over there.

5725
03:20:05,040 --> 03:20:06,020
Oh, what the heck.

5726
03:20:06,120 --> 03:20:07,540
So we would have to go in the garden.

5727
03:20:07,740 --> 03:20:08,680
But what if free-range...

5728
03:20:09,500 --> 03:20:11,940
Maybe if like two people waited to ship.

5729
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:13,580
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

5730
03:20:13,720 --> 03:20:15,920
I'm gonna take my stuff back and do a couple things.

5731
03:20:17,380 --> 03:20:18,880
Actually, let me get...

5732
03:20:20,180 --> 03:20:21,480
Wait, Aira-sama.

5733
03:20:21,640 --> 03:20:23,600
Give me your Rubik's Cube.

5734
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:24,240
I'll take it also.

5735
03:20:24,620 --> 03:20:26,520
Also this one.

5736
03:20:26,720 --> 03:20:28,340
Give it all.

5737
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:31,540
Take my positions.

5738
03:20:32,120 --> 03:20:33,360
Okay, thank you.

5739
03:20:33,700 --> 03:20:34,880
Be careful, Miyake.

5740
03:20:36,420 --> 03:20:38,440
Alright, let's go back.

5741
03:20:38,920 --> 03:20:39,640
Free-range.

5742
03:20:39,900 --> 03:20:41,560
We'll have to wait another day.

5743
03:20:42,260 --> 03:20:42,820
Alright.

5744
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:43,720
Um.

5745
03:20:45,820 --> 03:20:47,060
Oh, let go.

5746
03:20:49,140 --> 03:20:49,780
Okay.

5747
03:20:50,180 --> 03:20:51,480
And it's only 12.

5748
03:20:51,640 --> 03:20:52,500
So it should be good.

5749
03:20:53,160 --> 03:20:54,260
What a thrill.

5750
03:20:55,320 --> 03:20:56,540
With darkness.

5751
03:20:57,500 --> 03:20:59,600
And silence through the night.

5752
03:21:01,660 --> 03:21:02,440
Scared me.

5753
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:06,280
Alright, I'm gonna be on patrol.

5754
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:10,100
You know, I could turn off the things.

5755
03:21:14,610 --> 03:21:16,350
50 for the tea kettle.

5756
03:21:16,890 --> 03:21:17,330
Wow.

5757
03:21:18,190 --> 03:21:19,110
408, you guys.

5758
03:21:20,370 --> 03:21:21,830
I think we're gonna be able to go.

5759
03:21:23,530 --> 03:21:24,710
I think we're gonna be able...

5760
03:21:24,710 --> 03:21:25,670
Oh, wait.

5761
03:21:25,830 --> 03:21:27,150
How do I turn it off?

5762
03:21:27,970 --> 03:21:28,410
Um.

5763
03:21:30,710 --> 03:21:31,150
Other?

5764
03:21:32,370 --> 03:21:32,810
Um.

5765
03:21:33,190 --> 03:21:33,630
Uh.

5766
03:21:36,010 --> 03:21:37,190
Oh, shoot.

5767
03:21:37,330 --> 03:21:37,990
What do I...

5768
03:21:37,990 --> 03:21:38,250
Um.

5769
03:21:39,670 --> 03:21:40,190
Um.

5770
03:21:41,330 --> 03:21:42,490
Type the code?

5771
03:21:42,570 --> 03:21:43,290
Oh, type the code.

5772
03:21:45,090 --> 03:21:45,610
C2?

5773
03:21:53,880 --> 03:21:55,640
They don't realize I turned it off.

5774
03:21:56,520 --> 03:21:57,140
Uh oh.

5775
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:57,360
Okay.

5776
03:21:57,800 --> 03:22:01,680
Oh my gosh.

5777
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:08,150
Oh my god.

5778
03:22:08,250 --> 03:22:08,750
Oh my god.

5779
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:10,730
Oh my god.

5780
03:22:11,470 --> 03:22:12,590
Type view monitor.

5781
03:22:12,830 --> 03:22:13,490
View monitor.

5782
03:22:14,650 --> 03:22:15,250
Oh.

5783
03:22:16,630 --> 03:22:17,810
That's so awesome.

5784
03:22:17,950 --> 03:22:18,310
C2.

5785
03:22:19,290 --> 03:22:20,230
Oh, they're just...

5786
03:22:20,230 --> 03:22:20,850
They're just leaving.

5787
03:22:22,310 --> 03:22:24,010
Wow, it's so high def.

5788
03:22:24,550 --> 03:22:25,810
Oh, there they are.

5789
03:22:28,090 --> 03:22:28,690
Okay.

5790
03:22:30,690 --> 03:22:31,290
Okay.

5791
03:22:33,290 --> 03:22:34,710
So have you heard of portable apps?

5792
03:22:34,850 --> 03:22:35,550
Of course.

5793
03:22:35,750 --> 03:22:37,770
I played portable apps.

5794
03:22:38,090 --> 03:22:39,150
What do you mean?

5795
03:22:43,490 --> 03:22:44,310
I played portable apps.

5796
03:22:44,530 --> 03:22:46,230
Here they come.

5797
03:22:47,450 --> 03:22:48,030
Here they come.

5798
03:22:48,030 --> 03:22:48,330
Here they come.

5799
03:22:48,610 --> 03:22:49,150
Here they come.

5800
03:22:49,290 --> 03:22:50,050
Here they come.

5801
03:22:51,190 --> 03:22:52,310
Here they come.

5802
03:22:56,010 --> 03:22:56,650
Where

5803
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:06,400
are they?

5804
03:23:07,280 --> 03:23:08,680
They should have been here by now.

5805
03:23:11,120 --> 03:23:11,760
Um.

5806
03:23:15,300 --> 03:23:15,940
Uh.

5807
03:23:17,360 --> 03:23:18,000
Uh.

5808
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:20,800
Uh.

5809
03:23:27,980 --> 03:23:28,860
Elbow's World.

5810
03:23:28,900 --> 03:23:29,000
Elbow's World.

5811
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:29,840
Ba dum ba dum.

5812
03:23:30,040 --> 03:23:31,240
Ba dum ba dum.

5813
03:23:31,860 --> 03:23:32,620
Elbow's World.

5814
03:23:32,800 --> 03:23:35,100
You know, when I was a kid...

5815
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:35,400
Oh.

5816
03:23:35,540 --> 03:23:37,880
Oh, you found it.

5817
03:23:39,020 --> 03:23:39,540
Hello.

5818
03:23:40,060 --> 03:23:41,960
Yeah, I could tell.

5819
03:23:42,660 --> 03:23:45,340
I was turning off the turret for you guys.

5820
03:23:45,680 --> 03:23:46,480
Oh, really?

5821
03:23:46,840 --> 03:23:47,360
Yeah.

5822
03:23:47,440 --> 03:23:49,660
Yeah, we couldn't tell if it was off or not.

5823
03:23:52,440 --> 03:23:52,660
Okay.

5824
03:23:52,660 --> 03:23:54,000
It only lasts for a little bit.

5825
03:23:55,080 --> 03:23:55,940
Ah, I see.

5826
03:23:56,760 --> 03:23:58,500
Apparently the turrets were turned off.

5827
03:23:59,140 --> 03:24:00,680
Yeah, you can turn off the turrets.

5828
03:24:00,780 --> 03:24:01,180
Oh.

5829
03:24:02,180 --> 03:24:02,720
Oh, really?

5830
03:24:02,860 --> 03:24:04,560
I don't know when you turn it off.

5831
03:24:05,660 --> 03:24:08,200
Is it like a timing thing?

5832
03:24:09,180 --> 03:24:11,620
Yeah, it turns off for like a couple seconds.

5833
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:12,060
It's a timing thing.

5834
03:24:12,240 --> 03:24:12,500
Yeah.

5835
03:24:12,740 --> 03:24:13,060
Oh.

5836
03:24:13,960 --> 03:24:17,060
Oh, was it when it like pointed upwards?

5837
03:24:17,460 --> 03:24:19,060
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5838
03:24:19,080 --> 03:24:19,640
That might be it.

5839
03:24:20,100 --> 03:24:21,180
Ah, that might have been it.

5840
03:24:21,260 --> 03:24:22,260
Yeah, we noticed that.

5841
03:24:22,440 --> 03:24:23,680
We weren't sure what it was doing.

5842
03:24:26,820 --> 03:24:27,300
Whoopsie.

5843
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:28,360
Okay, let's go.

5844
03:24:28,520 --> 03:24:29,260
I think we're good.

5845
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:37,060
I think if we do really well in the next thing, I think if we do really well in the next thing, we can probably afford rend in the next try, I think.

5846
03:24:37,060 --> 03:24:37,080
we can probably afford rend in the next try, I think.

5847
03:24:37,080 --> 03:24:39,600
we can probably afford rend in the next try, I think.

5848
03:24:40,420 --> 03:24:41,100
Yeah, yeah.

5849
03:24:41,220 --> 03:24:43,380
Wait, why is like the large axle...

5850
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:44,240
Why is it red?

5851
03:24:46,200 --> 03:24:47,320
Okay, let's go!

5852
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:49,280
Total right now is like 400.

5853
03:24:49,280 --> 03:24:49,520
400.

5854
03:24:51,320 --> 03:24:51,960
Yeah.

5855
03:24:52,640 --> 03:24:53,880
Nice, nice, nice.

5856
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:54,640
Oh, wow.

5857
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:56,020
Yeah, we're good.

5858
03:24:56,360 --> 03:24:57,200
This is the run.

5859
03:24:57,380 --> 03:24:58,280
We just need a bit more.

5860
03:24:58,600 --> 03:25:00,380
A bit more.

5861
03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:03,200
500, 950.

5862
03:25:04,300 --> 03:25:05,180
Great asset.

5863
03:25:05,520 --> 03:25:06,640
Great, great asset.

5864
03:25:07,060 --> 03:25:08,860
Great, great asset.

5865
03:25:11,440 --> 03:25:13,440
How am I the laziest?

5866
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:14,340
Yeah!

5867
03:25:14,340 --> 03:25:15,700
You're the most profitable.

5868
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:17,640
How is that possible?

5869
03:25:19,340 --> 03:25:21,120
Okay, one day left.

5870
03:25:22,020 --> 03:25:23,340
One day left.

5871
03:25:23,660 --> 03:25:24,620
How do we go?

5872
03:25:25,940 --> 03:25:27,220
Let's go... okay.

5873
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:29,420
We can only go experimentation or assurance.

5874
03:25:29,580 --> 03:25:31,020
So let's just do experimentation.

5875
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:32,300
Yeah, experiment.

5876
03:25:32,700 --> 03:25:33,300
Yeah.

5877
03:25:34,900 --> 03:25:36,180
Let's go.

5878
03:25:38,340 --> 03:25:39,500
Let's go.

5879
03:25:39,720 --> 03:25:40,180
Let's go.

5880
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:41,280
Yeah.

5881
03:25:45,440 --> 03:25:45,960
Shoop.

5882
03:25:46,900 --> 03:25:47,420
Time.

5883
03:25:48,360 --> 03:25:49,060
All right.

5884
03:25:49,280 --> 03:25:50,920
Work smarter, not harder.

5885
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:52,200
Exactly, you guys.

5886
03:25:52,580 --> 03:25:53,100
Exactly.

5887
03:25:54,060 --> 03:25:54,580
Eclipse?

5888
03:25:54,780 --> 03:25:56,320
No, no way.

5889
03:25:56,700 --> 03:25:57,260
Wait, what?

5890
03:25:59,140 --> 03:26:00,360
It's not eclipse, right?

5891
03:26:02,460 --> 03:26:04,180
No, it's not eclipse, right?

5892
03:26:04,960 --> 03:26:06,060
No, we're good.

5893
03:26:06,260 --> 03:26:06,980
We're good.

5894
03:26:07,220 --> 03:26:08,540
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

5895
03:26:08,540 --> 03:26:09,280
We're good.

5896
03:26:10,640 --> 03:26:11,860
Frames are dropping.

5897
03:26:13,560 --> 03:26:14,640
Yeah, we're good.

5898
03:26:14,780 --> 03:26:15,700
All right.

5899
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:18,160
Performance mode.

5900
03:26:18,400 --> 03:26:18,920
Okay.

5901
03:26:19,480 --> 03:26:20,040
Okay.

5902
03:26:21,540 --> 03:26:22,400
I'm sorry.

5903
03:26:22,780 --> 03:26:23,720
No worries.

5904
03:26:25,140 --> 03:26:26,860
What is this building here?

5905
03:26:26,960 --> 03:26:27,920
I've never noticed this before.

5906
03:26:28,700 --> 03:26:29,260
What?

5907
03:26:31,100 --> 03:26:32,120
Oh, what the heck?

5908
03:26:33,420 --> 03:26:33,980
Huh?

5909
03:26:34,260 --> 03:26:35,760
I've never noticed this before.

5910
03:26:36,040 --> 03:26:36,740
What is this?

5911
03:26:36,800 --> 03:26:37,020
Yeah.

5912
03:26:37,180 --> 03:26:38,180
I'm scared though.

5913
03:26:39,280 --> 03:26:39,760
It's so dark.

5914
03:26:41,340 --> 03:26:42,060
That's spooky.

5915
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:43,240
It's like a haunted house.

5916
03:26:44,020 --> 03:26:46,620
It's like it teleports you to another world.

5917
03:26:46,980 --> 03:26:48,020
Stick to the plan.

5918
03:26:48,780 --> 03:26:49,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5919
03:26:49,900 --> 03:26:50,780
Work smarter.

5920
03:26:51,100 --> 03:26:51,840
Yeah, the plan, the plan.

5921
03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:54,280
What's in there?

5922
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:57,180
But what's in there?

5923
03:26:58,900 --> 03:27:00,300
But what's in there?

5924
03:27:00,740 --> 03:27:01,260
But what's in there?

5925
03:27:01,260 --> 03:27:01,920
I almost got lost.

5926
03:27:02,040 --> 03:27:02,900
All right.

5927
03:27:03,300 --> 03:27:06,000
You lost, Naki.

5928
03:27:07,680 --> 03:27:09,260
I almost went the other way.

5929
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:10,620
You okay?

5930
03:27:12,020 --> 03:27:12,920
Okay, there they are.

5931
03:27:13,020 --> 03:27:13,220
We're good?

5932
03:27:13,760 --> 03:27:14,440
Everyone's good?

5933
03:27:14,800 --> 03:27:14,880
Yeah, we're good.

5934
03:27:15,280 --> 03:27:15,880
And in.

5935
03:27:19,280 --> 03:27:20,200
All right.

5936
03:27:20,320 --> 03:27:21,100
Oh, yield sign.

5937
03:27:22,420 --> 03:27:22,980
Anything?

5938
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:30,240
It's a pretty big room.

5939
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:31,460
Nothing here?

5940
03:27:32,560 --> 03:27:33,120
Wow.

5941
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:36,920
This planet's holding out on us.

5942
03:27:37,020 --> 03:27:37,580
What a waste.

5943
03:27:38,520 --> 03:27:39,400
Nice sign.

5944
03:27:39,580 --> 03:27:39,980
Thanks.

5945
03:27:44,600 --> 03:27:45,400
Nothing here.

5946
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:51,680
Nothing here.

5947
03:27:52,600 --> 03:27:53,000
Nothing.

5948
03:27:53,440 --> 03:27:53,700
Nothing.

5949
03:27:54,420 --> 03:27:55,200
I'm so empty.

5950
03:27:55,360 --> 03:27:55,820
Oh, hello.

5951
03:27:56,100 --> 03:27:59,840
I saw something flash.

5952
03:28:00,720 --> 03:28:01,740
Oh, it might have been...

5953
03:28:01,740 --> 03:28:02,640
Oh, it's a mine.

5954
03:28:02,880 --> 03:28:03,280
It's a mine.

5955
03:28:03,320 --> 03:28:03,960
I can hear it.

5956
03:28:04,100 --> 03:28:04,320
A mine?

5957
03:28:04,660 --> 03:28:05,260
Oh, okay.

5958
03:28:05,360 --> 03:28:05,840
Where was it?

5959
03:28:05,860 --> 03:28:06,160
Oh, there?

5960
03:28:08,380 --> 03:28:09,660
You can just scan.

5961
03:28:10,560 --> 03:28:11,420
Oh, it's over here.

5962
03:28:11,520 --> 03:28:11,840
It's over here.

5963
03:28:12,740 --> 03:28:13,340
Okay, okay.

5964
03:28:15,960 --> 03:28:17,900
Oh, I don't think it's safe to go over here.

5965
03:28:17,960 --> 03:28:18,660
I don't think...

5966
03:28:18,660 --> 03:28:19,800
Yeah, we can go here.

5967
03:28:19,980 --> 03:28:21,440
I think it's hard to get around it.

5968
03:28:22,580 --> 03:28:23,840
I can go this way.

5969
03:28:25,100 --> 03:28:26,080
It's pretty tall.

5970
03:28:27,520 --> 03:28:28,440
Oh, dead end.

5971
03:28:28,600 --> 03:28:29,220
Dead end.

5972
03:28:30,800 --> 03:28:31,640
Down, down, down.

5973
03:28:38,300 --> 03:28:39,060
I'll go this way.

5974
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:41,240
Okay, I'll go this way.

5975
03:28:42,060 --> 03:28:43,260
Okay, I'll do this way.

5976
03:28:44,740 --> 03:28:45,960
There's a lot of ways to go.

5977
03:28:46,700 --> 03:28:48,900
There's a lot of open areas.

5978
03:28:49,720 --> 03:28:52,620
I feel like they're just all gonna loop around though.

5979
03:28:53,120 --> 03:28:53,680
Oh, hi.

5980
03:28:55,360 --> 03:28:55,840
Hi.

5981
03:28:56,000 --> 03:28:57,180
It was a dead end.

5982
03:28:57,520 --> 03:28:59,080
There's another mine.

5983
03:28:59,840 --> 03:29:00,960
Alright, be careful.

5984
03:29:01,720 --> 03:29:03,220
I think this also loops.

5985
03:29:03,620 --> 03:29:03,700
Okay.

5986
03:29:04,820 --> 03:29:07,860
Maybe it might be smart to leave it on fire.

5987
03:29:07,880 --> 03:29:08,220
I think.

5988
03:29:10,520 --> 03:29:11,480
Oh, wait.

5989
03:29:11,680 --> 03:29:12,000
Where?

5990
03:29:12,140 --> 03:29:12,780
What is this?

5991
03:29:13,020 --> 03:29:14,160
Oh, there's a door here.

5992
03:29:14,260 --> 03:29:14,920
There's a door here.

5993
03:29:16,580 --> 03:29:16,980
Okay.

5994
03:29:18,220 --> 03:29:18,940
Yeah, yeah.

5995
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:19,440
Over here.

5996
03:29:19,640 --> 03:29:20,040
Oh.

5997
03:29:21,060 --> 03:29:21,680
Oh, nice.

5998
03:29:22,280 --> 03:29:23,280
Oh, it just loops.

5999
03:29:24,300 --> 03:29:25,040
No way.

6000
03:29:29,020 --> 03:29:29,420
Wait.

6001
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:31,220
Where does that key go?

6002
03:29:33,780 --> 03:29:34,580
Good question.

6003
03:29:35,860 --> 03:29:37,120
How do we even... I think...

6004
03:29:38,100 --> 03:29:39,300
I think we came from up.

6005
03:29:39,460 --> 03:29:40,360
I think so too.

6006
03:29:40,540 --> 03:29:41,040
Yeah, from above.

6007
03:29:41,220 --> 03:29:43,320
How will we even get to the fire exit?

6008
03:29:43,320 --> 03:29:44,420
I don't know where it is on this.

6009
03:29:45,900 --> 03:29:46,880
It's hard to...

6010
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:48,800
go outside.

6011
03:29:49,440 --> 03:29:50,540
We have to go outside again.

6012
03:29:50,820 --> 03:29:51,040
Yeah.

6013
03:29:52,820 --> 03:29:53,140
Yeah.

6014
03:29:54,340 --> 03:29:56,060
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

6015
03:29:56,440 --> 03:29:57,200
I think you are.

6016
03:29:57,220 --> 03:29:57,660
I think you are.

6017
03:29:57,740 --> 03:29:58,900
Yes, I am.

6018
03:30:00,780 --> 03:30:02,140
I'm just a natural genius.

6019
03:30:04,200 --> 03:30:04,680
I think.

6020
03:30:05,580 --> 03:30:06,440
Still no free run.

6021
03:30:07,100 --> 03:30:08,180
I can't believe we lost.

6022
03:30:08,340 --> 03:30:08,740
Oh, yeah.

6023
03:30:08,780 --> 03:30:09,280
Of course.

6024
03:30:09,280 --> 03:30:10,560
The fire exit's right over here.

6025
03:30:11,280 --> 03:30:11,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6026
03:30:12,060 --> 03:30:13,220
I forgot we were on experimentation.

6027
03:30:15,720 --> 03:30:16,360
I forgot.

6028
03:30:16,880 --> 03:30:18,360
Wait, did I pass it?

6029
03:30:18,520 --> 03:30:19,000
Yes.

6030
03:30:25,090 --> 03:30:27,930
So many stairs.

6031
03:30:28,370 --> 03:30:28,550
I know.

6032
03:30:29,530 --> 03:30:30,570
It's already 2.

6033
03:30:30,890 --> 03:30:32,710
I got nothing except this sign.

6034
03:30:33,370 --> 03:30:35,550
I only got this metal sheet, so...

6035
03:30:35,550 --> 03:30:39,950
Yeah, we need more if we want to make it to REN next time.

6036
03:30:40,410 --> 03:30:43,210
I think it's possible to find something here.

6037
03:30:43,530 --> 03:30:43,730
Yeah.

6038
03:30:45,290 --> 03:30:46,370
Oh, the door here?

6039
03:30:46,370 --> 03:30:47,910
Oh, free run!

6040
03:30:48,790 --> 03:30:49,990
Free run!

6041
03:30:51,150 --> 03:30:51,750
Yay!

6042
03:30:55,280 --> 03:30:57,220
She came back to us.

6043
03:30:57,400 --> 03:30:57,860
Yeah.

6044
03:30:57,860 --> 03:30:59,440
We thought we lost her.

6045
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:00,020
Oh, my God.

6046
03:31:00,060 --> 03:31:02,180
We just were talking about her, you guys.

6047
03:31:02,640 --> 03:31:05,640
She came back when we needed her the most.

6048
03:31:05,720 --> 03:31:06,080
Yeah.

6049
03:31:07,160 --> 03:31:07,920
Let's go.

6050
03:31:08,340 --> 03:31:09,020
Let's go.

6051
03:31:12,520 --> 03:31:14,200
I kind of went...

6052
03:31:14,200 --> 03:31:14,440
Up there?

6053
03:31:15,080 --> 03:31:16,660
Yeah, I kind of went some places.

6054
03:31:17,240 --> 03:31:18,400
I went upstairs.

6055
03:31:18,700 --> 03:31:19,300
Yeah, I think.

6056
03:31:20,740 --> 03:31:22,320
There's a tattered metal...

6057
03:31:23,300 --> 03:31:24,120
Sheet somewhere.

6058
03:31:24,700 --> 03:31:25,740
I think it's upstairs.

6059
03:31:26,820 --> 03:31:27,140
Okay.

6060
03:31:29,320 --> 03:31:30,440
Free run is...

6061
03:31:30,440 --> 03:31:31,580
Wait, where is it?

6062
03:31:31,760 --> 03:31:33,140
Am I blind, you guys?

6063
03:31:33,780 --> 03:31:34,840
I don't see it.

6064
03:31:34,960 --> 03:31:35,720
Oh, I hear a cat!

6065
03:31:36,280 --> 03:31:38,340
We're gonna get free run and a cat?

6066
03:31:38,520 --> 03:31:39,160
No way.

6067
03:31:40,080 --> 03:31:40,920
Let's do it.

6068
03:31:42,160 --> 03:31:42,680
Cat!

6069
03:31:43,300 --> 03:31:43,820
Cat!

6070
03:31:45,820 --> 03:31:47,160
Oh, it's Oliver!

6071
03:31:48,700 --> 03:31:49,020
Meow!

6072
03:31:49,320 --> 03:31:50,740
Oliver, let's go!

6073
03:31:51,320 --> 03:31:51,920
Where is he?

6074
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:53,980
I don't know.

6075
03:31:54,300 --> 03:31:54,900
Meow.

6076
03:31:57,560 --> 03:31:58,160
Hello?

6077
03:32:00,420 --> 03:32:01,080
Where is he?

6078
03:32:02,360 --> 03:32:03,720
I hear him!

6079
03:32:03,740 --> 03:32:04,000
I know!

6080
03:32:04,080 --> 03:32:05,560
I feel so sorry for him!

6081
03:32:05,620 --> 03:32:06,200
Where are you?

6082
03:32:07,360 --> 03:32:07,960
Oliver?

6083
03:32:08,540 --> 03:32:09,500
Oh, maybe...

6084
03:32:12,340 --> 03:32:13,240
He's hiding?

6085
03:32:15,240 --> 03:32:15,840
Oliver?

6086
03:32:15,840 --> 03:32:16,000
Oliver?

6087
03:32:19,760 --> 03:32:21,100
I scanned him earlier.

6088
03:32:21,960 --> 03:32:23,960
But now he's gone where I scanned him.

6089
03:32:24,640 --> 03:32:25,520
Oh, I heard him!

6090
03:32:25,680 --> 03:32:26,120
Yeah.

6091
03:32:29,140 --> 03:32:30,360
Did I just go in a circle?

6092
03:32:32,360 --> 03:32:32,800
Hmm...

6093
03:32:32,800 --> 03:32:33,200
What?

6094
03:32:36,060 --> 03:32:36,860
Oh my gosh.

6095
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:37,780
Oh wait, maybe in here.

6096
03:32:38,860 --> 03:32:39,300
Meow.

6097
03:32:42,130 --> 03:32:43,450
Did you go down or up?

6098
03:32:43,630 --> 03:32:44,210
I'm down.

6099
03:32:44,210 --> 03:32:44,290
Down?

6100
03:32:47,700 --> 03:32:47,800
Oh!

6101
03:32:48,760 --> 03:32:50,140
It's quiet, you guys.

6102
03:32:50,220 --> 03:32:51,180
It's a little too quiet.

6103
03:32:52,140 --> 03:32:52,500
Meow?

6104
03:32:53,020 --> 03:32:53,380
Meow?

6105
03:32:53,980 --> 03:32:55,460
I see a metal sheet.

6106
03:32:55,640 --> 03:32:56,140
I can't grab it though.

6107
03:32:56,140 --> 03:32:56,440
I know.

6108
03:32:56,580 --> 03:32:57,420
I can't get it either.

6109
03:32:58,460 --> 03:32:59,140
Oh, wait, wait.

6110
03:32:59,340 --> 03:33:00,020
I got it.

6111
03:33:00,120 --> 03:33:00,620
I got it.

6112
03:33:00,680 --> 03:33:01,800
A gamer.

6113
03:33:02,260 --> 03:33:02,620
Nice.

6114
03:33:03,200 --> 03:33:04,320
But where is Oliver?

6115
03:33:06,200 --> 03:33:07,500
I can hear him.

6116
03:33:08,600 --> 03:33:09,940
I wanna get him and then we...

6117
03:33:09,940 --> 03:33:10,300
You know what?

6118
03:33:10,340 --> 03:33:11,280
I think we should get him and then...

6119
03:33:11,280 --> 03:33:12,900
Actually, it's probably really late, Emily.

6120
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:13,820
I think we should just leave.

6121
03:33:14,460 --> 03:33:15,120
Yeah, maybe.

6122
03:33:15,520 --> 03:33:16,200
Okay, how do we leave?

6123
03:33:16,320 --> 03:33:16,740
I don't know.

6124
03:33:16,840 --> 03:33:17,840
Oliver, I'm sorry!

6125
03:33:18,980 --> 03:33:19,880
Sorry, Oliver!

6126
03:33:20,400 --> 03:33:21,100
I wanted to get you.

6127
03:33:21,860 --> 03:33:22,560
Where did you go?

6128
03:33:22,760 --> 03:33:23,320
Oh, that way?

6129
03:33:23,420 --> 03:33:24,300
I think we went down.

6130
03:33:26,640 --> 03:33:28,180
And then which way was it?

6131
03:33:29,740 --> 03:33:30,280
This way.

6132
03:33:30,520 --> 03:33:30,860
This way?

6133
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:31,240
Okay.

6134
03:33:33,080 --> 03:33:33,600
Uh-oh.

6135
03:33:34,960 --> 03:33:35,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

6136
03:33:35,980 --> 03:33:36,900
Okay, okay.

6137
03:33:38,700 --> 03:33:39,740
Yeah, it's already 6.

6138
03:33:41,280 --> 03:33:41,620
Guys, it's okay.

6139
03:33:42,280 --> 03:33:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6140
03:33:44,480 --> 03:33:44,920
Oliver...

6141
03:33:46,900 --> 03:33:49,220
I'm gonna be thinking about Oliver all day today.

6142
03:33:49,320 --> 03:33:50,520
Yeah, I'm gonna feel so bad.

6143
03:34:09,140 --> 03:34:09,960
No creature.

6144
03:34:11,100 --> 03:34:11,540
Yeah.

6145
03:34:33,320 --> 03:34:34,060
Where are you?

6146
03:34:34,660 --> 03:34:35,400
Are you good?

6147
03:34:57,360 --> 03:34:58,740
I hope they were dead.

6148
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:00,800
Oh.

6149
03:35:02,520 --> 03:35:04,100
I don't think they were dead.

6150
03:35:05,640 --> 03:35:08,110
Oh, they were dead!

6151
03:35:08,290 --> 03:35:08,670
Just kidding.

6152
03:35:08,950 --> 03:35:09,670
They were dead.

6153
03:35:14,410 --> 03:35:15,890
Oh my god!

6154
03:35:18,410 --> 03:35:20,170
Oh my god!

6155
03:35:21,290 --> 03:35:21,730
Oh my god!

6156
03:35:21,730 --> 03:35:23,070
At least Freerun dropped.

6157
03:35:26,170 --> 03:35:27,310
Freerun blessed you.

6158
03:35:27,710 --> 03:35:28,150
Freerun...

6159
03:35:28,150 --> 03:35:28,970
She gave you her blessing.

6160
03:35:28,970 --> 03:35:31,530
I didn't think I was gonna make it, I'll be honest.

6161
03:35:31,630 --> 03:35:32,150
I was so scared.

6162
03:35:32,330 --> 03:35:34,530
It was so good!

6163
03:35:35,010 --> 03:35:35,910
Oh my god!

6164
03:35:37,490 --> 03:35:37,930
519!

6165
03:35:39,790 --> 03:35:42,010
We're so close!

6166
03:35:42,250 --> 03:35:45,110
If only we had gotten Oliver, we would have made it.

6167
03:35:45,590 --> 03:35:47,810
No, no, no, we could have killed someone and saw their body.

6168
03:35:48,350 --> 03:35:50,130
But we also lose money, don't we?

6169
03:35:50,170 --> 03:35:50,790
Then too?

6170
03:35:53,530 --> 03:35:54,490
I forgot

6171
03:35:59,500 --> 03:36:01,600
how much you get from killing someone.

6172
03:36:01,780 --> 03:36:02,140
I don't know.

6173
03:36:02,860 --> 03:36:03,340
Really?

6174
03:36:03,780 --> 03:36:07,560
How much you can sell body for.

6175
03:36:08,000 --> 03:36:08,420
Oh!

6176
03:36:08,420 --> 03:36:10,660
Someone said we'll get overtime bonus.

6177
03:36:10,760 --> 03:36:11,780
So we might actually make it.

6178
03:36:12,480 --> 03:36:12,960
Oh!

6179
03:36:15,440 --> 03:36:16,520
Nice, nice, nice.

6180
03:36:16,800 --> 03:36:17,320
I believe, I believe.

6181
03:36:17,480 --> 03:36:19,380
Oh, you only get five.

6182
03:36:21,760 --> 03:36:23,180
Oh, it's only five dollars?

6183
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:24,000
Okay, that's nothing.

6184
03:36:25,180 --> 03:36:26,040
Never mind.

6185
03:36:26,080 --> 03:36:27,280
Never mind.

6186
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:31,600
I can't believe humans are worthless.

6187
03:36:32,180 --> 03:36:34,180
Humans are worthless.

6188
03:36:34,940 --> 03:36:37,760
Humans are worthless.

6189
03:36:37,760 --> 03:36:38,180
Am I good?

6190
03:36:39,100 --> 03:36:42,060
Am I streaming?

6191
03:36:45,020 --> 03:36:45,680
I'm back?

6192
03:36:45,940 --> 03:36:52,040
I had a...

6193
03:36:57,100 --> 03:36:58,000
Watch out, watch out!

6194
03:36:58,160 --> 03:36:59,560
Go, go, go, walk away, walk away!

6195
03:37:00,840 --> 03:37:01,680
Goodbye, free rent!

6196
03:37:02,460 --> 03:37:03,340
Free rent!

6197
03:37:04,400 --> 03:37:06,120
Bye, free rent!

6198
03:37:10,220 --> 03:37:11,340
That was close.

6199
03:37:11,720 --> 03:37:13,800
Free rent!

6200
03:37:15,240 --> 03:37:16,880
We had to sell her, you guys.

6201
03:37:16,920 --> 03:37:17,800
We had to sell her.

6202
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:19,180
She was worth a lot of money.

6203
03:37:21,320 --> 03:37:21,820
Desperate times.

6204
03:37:22,260 --> 03:37:22,980
Desperate times.

6205
03:37:25,060 --> 03:37:27,260
How much did we make?

6206
03:37:27,400 --> 03:37:28,080
Put everything.

6207
03:37:28,420 --> 03:37:29,040
I think so.

6208
03:37:29,160 --> 03:37:29,740
We got 300.

6209
03:37:31,640 --> 03:37:33,200
We got 371.

6210
03:37:34,280 --> 03:37:35,140
Ding, ding, ding.

6211
03:37:40,880 --> 03:37:42,140
Oh, okay, nice.

6212
03:37:43,220 --> 03:37:43,740
Okay.

6213
03:37:47,820 --> 03:37:49,680
How much did we get?

6214
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:49,940
Okay.

6215
03:37:50,080 --> 03:37:51,220
How much are we at?

6216
03:37:51,400 --> 03:37:52,860
We have... okay, okay, key.

6217
03:37:53,940 --> 03:37:54,460
543!

6218
03:37:55,440 --> 03:37:56,680
We're so close!

6219
03:37:56,860 --> 03:37:58,320
We're so close, oh my gosh.

6220
03:37:58,620 --> 03:38:00,820
Wait, wait, we have to wait for the overtime bonus, right?

6221
03:38:00,820 --> 03:38:01,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6222
03:38:01,520 --> 03:38:03,580
So once I think we take off, then we'll be good.

6223
03:38:03,600 --> 03:38:04,500
I think we're gonna make it.

6224
03:38:04,700 --> 03:38:05,360
Okay, fingers crossed!

6225
03:38:05,900 --> 03:38:06,260
Let's go!

6226
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:07,600
Let's go!

6227
03:38:13,840 --> 03:38:16,260
Do we actually get it?

6228
03:38:17,380 --> 03:38:18,180
I hope so.

6229
03:38:18,320 --> 03:38:18,600
Okay.

6230
03:38:19,560 --> 03:38:20,560
There should be.

6231
03:38:22,140 --> 03:38:22,500
Okay.

6232
03:38:22,500 --> 03:38:22,860
Okay.

6233
03:38:22,860 --> 03:38:23,260
Okay.

6234
03:38:28,180 --> 03:38:28,740
Okay.

6235
03:38:32,400 --> 03:38:32,960
Yeah!

6236
03:38:33,360 --> 03:38:34,540
Did we make it?

6237
03:38:38,380 --> 03:38:38,940
Yes!

6238
03:38:39,260 --> 03:38:40,840
We can go to REND!

6239
03:38:40,940 --> 03:38:42,240
We can go to REND!

6240
03:38:43,640 --> 03:38:44,200
Let's go!

6241
03:38:45,940 --> 03:38:47,040
Why did I run?

6242
03:38:48,360 --> 03:38:48,920
Alright,

6243
03:38:52,320 --> 03:38:53,160
last run, last run?

6244
03:38:53,360 --> 03:38:54,200
Yeah, last run.

6245
03:38:56,300 --> 03:38:56,740
Alright!

6246
03:38:57,460 --> 03:39:02,040
Alright, and REND had, like, it wasn't it wasn't eclipsed or anything, so we're good.

6247
03:39:02,060 --> 03:39:02,500
Okay, good, good, good.

6248
03:39:03,540 --> 03:39:04,060
Let's go!

6249
03:39:06,460 --> 03:39:07,120
Let's go!

6250
03:39:07,540 --> 03:39:08,320
So happy!

6251
03:39:10,780 --> 03:39:11,840
We're in there!

6252
03:39:12,200 --> 03:39:12,800
We did so well!

6253
03:39:19,700 --> 03:39:20,920
I'm so excited!

6254
03:39:22,020 --> 03:39:22,280
Wow!

6255
03:39:22,280 --> 03:39:22,780
Wow!

6256
03:39:26,230 --> 03:39:28,490
Alright guys, just follow the lights.

6257
03:39:28,630 --> 03:39:28,770
Just follow the lights, right?

6258
03:39:28,910 --> 03:39:30,390
Yeah, just follow the lights.

6259
03:39:31,070 --> 03:39:32,230
Alright, here we go.

6260
03:39:32,490 --> 03:39:33,470
Here we go, everyone!

6261
03:39:34,590 --> 03:39:35,610
Follow the lights!

6262
03:39:41,670 --> 03:39:43,050
Hopefully it's a mansion.

6263
03:39:43,350 --> 03:39:44,070
Hopefully it's a mansion.

6264
03:39:44,650 --> 03:39:45,530
Fingers crossed.

6265
03:39:45,990 --> 03:39:46,470
Okay.

6266
03:39:48,570 --> 03:39:49,550
It's up here, it's up here.

6267
03:39:51,670 --> 03:39:52,790
Wait, yeah, yeah.

6268
03:39:52,830 --> 03:39:53,330
Right here, right here.

6269
03:39:53,330 --> 03:39:54,490
Yeah, yeah, here's the door.

6270
03:39:54,630 --> 03:39:55,050
Over here.

6271
03:39:55,450 --> 03:39:56,250
Alright, alright.

6272
03:39:58,370 --> 03:39:58,850
Yeah!

6273
03:40:02,950 --> 03:40:04,230
We made it!

6274
03:40:04,270 --> 03:40:04,550
We made it!

6275
03:40:04,630 --> 03:40:04,690
Goku!

6276
03:40:06,570 --> 03:40:08,650
This is actually more creepy, oh my god.

6277
03:40:08,870 --> 03:40:09,870
She hasn't forgotten about Goku.

6278
03:40:09,870 --> 03:40:12,290
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up on you.

6279
03:40:16,310 --> 03:40:18,030
This is so cool, though.

6280
03:40:18,270 --> 03:40:20,670
There's scarier monsters in here, though, so be careful.

6281
03:40:20,930 --> 03:40:21,130
Yeah.

6282
03:40:21,130 --> 03:40:21,650
Oh, really?

6283
03:40:22,050 --> 03:40:24,470
I think there's some new ones, too.

6284
03:40:24,670 --> 03:40:26,090
Yeah, we still haven't seen the new guy.

6285
03:40:26,450 --> 03:40:28,430
Maybe because we have to come here.

6286
03:40:28,610 --> 03:40:29,850
I think they're here, yeah.

6287
03:40:32,730 --> 03:40:34,110
There's a door over here, too, right?

6288
03:40:35,210 --> 03:40:35,790
Yeah, yeah.

6289
03:40:37,290 --> 03:40:40,550
Oh, there's a hairbrush.

6290
03:40:40,810 --> 03:40:41,490
And another one.

6291
03:40:41,750 --> 03:40:42,230
Oh, nice.

6292
03:40:43,790 --> 03:40:44,930
Oh, I hear a cat!

6293
03:40:45,570 --> 03:40:45,970
Oliver!

6294
03:40:49,440 --> 03:40:51,800
We haven't seen a cat for so long, actually.

6295
03:40:52,120 --> 03:40:52,280
Yeah.

6296
03:40:52,400 --> 03:40:53,240
Oh my god!

6297
03:40:53,460 --> 03:40:54,020
He's so cute!

6298
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:55,560
It's...

6299
03:40:57,020 --> 03:40:57,920
What's your name?

6300
03:40:58,240 --> 03:40:59,100
It's Kiki!

6301
03:41:00,140 --> 03:41:01,260
Oh my god!

6302
03:41:01,460 --> 03:41:02,020
Kiki!

6303
03:41:02,780 --> 03:41:03,900
Kiki's purring!

6304
03:41:03,900 --> 03:41:04,640
He's so cute!

6305
03:41:05,200 --> 03:41:05,760
Kiki!

6306
03:41:06,000 --> 03:41:07,620
Oh, cute Kiki!

6307
03:41:07,780 --> 03:41:08,360
Oh, yes.

6308
03:41:09,220 --> 03:41:10,180
Flip that cat.

6309
03:41:10,340 --> 03:41:10,900
Flip him.

6310
03:41:10,940 --> 03:41:12,960
We have to do that so roughly, though.

6311
03:41:13,020 --> 03:41:13,580
No.

6312
03:41:14,240 --> 03:41:15,700
You're pulling on his head.

6313
03:41:16,240 --> 03:41:17,460
You're stroking it.

6314
03:41:18,240 --> 03:41:19,080
Okay, nice.

6315
03:41:19,540 --> 03:41:21,920
I think everywhere else is a dead end over here.

6316
03:41:23,460 --> 03:41:24,260
We have won.

6317
03:41:26,140 --> 03:41:27,600
Friendship ended with Oliver.

6318
03:41:28,060 --> 03:41:29,240
Kiki's my new best friend.

6319
03:41:32,840 --> 03:41:34,400
Oliver wasn't worth it.

6320
03:41:34,560 --> 03:41:36,040
Maybe just put him by the door right here.

6321
03:41:37,260 --> 03:41:41,600
Well, hopefully we see Kiki again.

6322
03:41:47,800 --> 03:41:49,670
I hope Kiki is not domesticated.

6323
03:41:50,260 --> 03:41:51,360
So that he doesn't...

6324
03:41:51,920 --> 03:41:53,600
So he belongs in the wild.

6325
03:41:56,280 --> 03:41:57,120
Let's see up here.

6326
03:41:57,120 --> 03:41:58,600
Okay, it's safe up there.

6327
03:41:58,760 --> 03:41:59,700
It's better out there.

6328
03:41:59,700 --> 03:42:01,280
Different doors.

6329
03:42:02,100 --> 03:42:03,020
Circle doors.

6330
03:42:03,820 --> 03:42:05,840
Wait, did I hear someone talk?

6331
03:42:07,400 --> 03:42:07,660
Oh!

6332
03:42:07,920 --> 03:42:08,460
What?

6333
03:42:11,540 --> 03:42:12,720
There we go.

6334
03:42:12,800 --> 03:42:14,220
I think we're all clicking on it.

6335
03:42:14,520 --> 03:42:15,280
There we go.

6336
03:42:16,180 --> 03:42:16,720
Silly.

6337
03:42:17,500 --> 03:42:18,280
Dead end.

6338
03:42:20,720 --> 03:42:21,800
Nothing here.

6339
03:42:21,960 --> 03:42:22,400
Go back.

6340
03:42:23,120 --> 03:42:24,180
Nothing here.

6341
03:42:24,180 --> 03:42:24,720
Where?

6342
03:42:24,980 --> 03:42:26,700
The door over here.

6343
03:42:26,740 --> 03:42:27,660
Over here.

6344
03:42:29,300 --> 03:42:32,440
Well, if there's nothing here then it's just Kiki.

6345
03:42:32,600 --> 03:42:32,800
I guess.

6346
03:42:34,340 --> 03:42:35,900
We can always come back.

6347
03:42:35,960 --> 03:42:37,700
We don't have to pay for it again.

6348
03:42:38,540 --> 03:42:39,620
Okay, I'll go this way.

6349
03:42:40,560 --> 03:42:41,520
Is it a loop?

6350
03:42:41,680 --> 03:42:42,000
Yes.

6351
03:42:44,300 --> 03:42:45,300
There's a lot of doors.

6352
03:42:47,800 --> 03:42:48,800
I heard something.

6353
03:42:49,560 --> 03:42:51,360
I think I was the one that died.

6354
03:42:51,360 --> 03:42:52,980
I heard something.

6355
03:42:53,320 --> 03:42:54,760
I heard something.

6356
03:42:55,280 --> 03:42:57,000
She's dead, everybody.

6357
03:42:57,700 --> 03:42:58,700
How did she die?

6358
03:42:59,220 --> 03:43:00,260
There was a...

6359
03:43:00,260 --> 03:43:02,360
She went, ooh, red carpet.

6360
03:43:02,400 --> 03:43:03,760
And then died to a trap.

6361
03:43:06,540 --> 03:43:08,120
So, just be careful.

6362
03:43:08,180 --> 03:43:11,420
There's some traps around.

6363
03:43:11,840 --> 03:43:12,380
Okay.

6364
03:43:13,740 --> 03:43:14,420
Okay.

6365
03:43:14,460 --> 03:43:15,840
Red carpet's scary.

6366
03:43:16,340 --> 03:43:17,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6367
03:43:21,360 --> 03:43:22,100
Oh, my God.

6368
03:43:22,140 --> 03:43:24,580
I can see her dangling body shadow.

6369
03:43:24,720 --> 03:43:25,840
It's so scary.

6370
03:43:27,340 --> 03:43:28,500
Oh, my gosh.

6371
03:43:29,780 --> 03:43:31,260
It's so scary.

6372
03:43:33,380 --> 03:43:34,460
Oh, my God.

6373
03:43:34,480 --> 03:43:35,640
It's so scary.

6374
03:43:37,380 --> 03:43:39,480
The shadow is so scary.

6375
03:43:43,320 --> 03:43:44,360
Uh-oh.

6376
03:44:00,300 --> 03:44:01,360
Hello, it's me.

6377
03:44:01,440 --> 03:44:02,120
I'm real.

6378
03:44:02,220 --> 03:44:02,720
I'm real.

6379
03:44:04,460 --> 03:44:05,540
Is she real?

6380
03:44:05,740 --> 03:44:06,680
Yes, I'm real.

6381
03:44:06,920 --> 03:44:07,340
It's me.

6382
03:44:07,560 --> 03:44:08,020
I'm real.

6383
03:44:10,350 --> 03:44:11,250
I'm real.

6384
03:44:12,410 --> 03:44:13,010
Wait.

6385
03:44:13,010 --> 03:44:13,650
What's that?

6386
03:44:17,060 --> 03:44:18,420
Oh, the fireplace room.

6387
03:44:19,140 --> 03:44:19,640
Uh-oh.

6388
03:44:19,700 --> 03:44:20,840
I hear the ambience again.

6389
03:44:21,200 --> 03:44:22,800
The ambience is starting again.

6390
03:44:24,000 --> 03:44:24,600
Hello?

6391
03:44:30,200 --> 03:44:31,680
I don't like the mansion.

6392
03:44:31,680 --> 03:44:32,880
It scares me by myself.

6393
03:44:33,480 --> 03:44:34,080
Wait.

6394
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:36,280
Hello?

6395
03:44:42,730 --> 03:44:44,330
Oh, there's the ambience.

6396
03:44:46,710 --> 03:44:47,490
What is it?

6397
03:44:47,530 --> 03:44:48,530
What is it, you guys think?

6398
03:44:49,130 --> 03:44:50,130
Do you think it's...

6399
03:44:50,630 --> 03:44:50,830
Goku?

6400
03:44:53,270 --> 03:44:53,670
Hello?

6401
03:45:12,760 --> 03:45:13,800
Oh, I'm back here.

6402
03:45:15,560 --> 03:45:16,620
Uh, this way.

6403
03:45:18,140 --> 03:45:18,780
This way.

6404
03:45:19,140 --> 03:45:19,940
Nice, nice, nice.

6405
03:45:23,120 --> 03:45:23,520
Okay.

6406
03:45:26,740 --> 03:45:28,340
So we just got a little bracken.

6407
03:45:28,700 --> 03:45:29,100
Uh...

6408
03:45:33,980 --> 03:45:34,380
Wait.

6409
03:45:34,380 --> 03:45:35,600
Do I have a girl?

6410
03:45:36,660 --> 03:45:37,820
Where's the music coming from?

6411
03:45:41,180 --> 03:45:41,940
Where's the girl?

6412
03:45:42,600 --> 03:45:43,860
Where's the music coming from?

6413
03:45:44,840 --> 03:45:45,280
Hello?

6414
03:45:47,020 --> 03:45:48,220
Are you guys outside?

6415
03:45:52,630 --> 03:45:53,530
No, it is me!

6416
03:45:53,670 --> 03:45:54,030
It's me!

6417
03:45:54,110 --> 03:45:54,370
It's me!

6418
03:46:01,160 --> 03:46:02,700
The bracken is check...

6419
03:46:02,700 --> 03:46:03,620
What was that?

6420
03:46:04,780 --> 03:46:06,060
I just heard someone laugh.

6421
03:46:06,300 --> 03:46:06,880
Where are you?

6422
03:46:08,000 --> 03:46:08,440
Hello?

6423
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:10,320
That's not her!

6424
03:46:10,460 --> 03:46:10,880
That's not her!

6425
03:46:14,160 --> 03:46:14,840
What?

6426
03:46:16,480 --> 03:46:17,920
They sounded so close.

6427
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:21,700
What's that?

6428
03:46:22,580 --> 03:46:23,260
Hello?

6429
03:46:26,300 --> 03:46:27,400
What's that sound?

6430
03:46:30,220 --> 03:46:31,340
What's that thump?

6431
03:46:33,200 --> 03:46:34,520
Oh, it's a jester?

6432
03:46:34,780 --> 03:46:35,280
Oh god.

6433
03:46:35,540 --> 03:46:36,700
It's a jester?

6434
03:46:37,540 --> 03:46:38,940
We are so...

6435
03:46:40,080 --> 03:46:40,760
Wait.

6436
03:46:45,540 --> 03:46:46,660
Uh oh.

6437
03:47:40,780 --> 03:47:42,700
Oh my god.

6438
03:47:42,720 --> 03:47:43,040
It's you!

6439
03:47:43,360 --> 03:47:44,380
I thought it was a dog!

6440
03:47:44,840 --> 03:47:45,860
Oh my god!

6441
03:47:48,520 --> 03:47:50,360
I thought it was a dog!

6442
03:48:03,430 --> 03:48:04,450
That's not you!

6443
03:48:05,290 --> 03:48:06,630
That's not you at all!

6444
03:48:07,810 --> 03:48:08,910
Oh my god!

6445
03:48:14,740 --> 03:48:15,840
Oh my god!

6446
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:17,140
I thought it was...

6447
03:48:17,140 --> 03:48:18,400
They even responded!

6448
03:48:19,720 --> 03:48:20,600
That's crazy!

6449
03:48:21,480 --> 03:48:22,300
No way!

6450
03:48:22,380 --> 03:48:23,300
It was a mimic!

6451
03:48:28,160 --> 03:48:29,260
Oh my god!

6452
03:48:29,280 --> 03:48:29,320
Hey!

6453
03:48:29,540 --> 03:48:32,930
What's up?

6454
03:48:33,210 --> 03:48:34,730
That was so scary!

6455
03:48:35,390 --> 03:48:36,070
What happened?

6456
03:48:38,110 --> 03:48:39,490
You're holding the cat.

6457
03:48:40,130 --> 03:48:41,030
Oh my god.

6458
03:48:41,150 --> 03:48:42,270
No, I thought...

6459
03:48:42,270 --> 03:48:44,490
Well, I was holding the cat and I heard something behind me.

6460
03:48:44,530 --> 03:48:46,250
And I was like, oh my gosh, a dog is following me.

6461
03:48:46,250 --> 03:48:47,130
And the cat is crying.

6462
03:48:48,130 --> 03:48:49,930
And then I turned around and I saw one of you.

6463
03:48:50,030 --> 03:48:51,890
And I think it had everybody's voice.

6464
03:48:52,030 --> 03:48:53,550
And I was like, oh my god, it's just you!

6465
03:48:54,230 --> 03:48:55,030
And so...

6466
03:48:55,030 --> 03:49:02,030
But then I got to the car, I got to the ship, and the dog attacked the mimic at the last second and saved me!

6467
03:49:02,510 --> 03:49:03,230
Oh my god!

6468
03:49:03,230 --> 03:49:04,370
It was following you!

6469
03:49:04,370 --> 03:49:05,730
It was following me!

6470
03:49:07,570 --> 03:49:08,730
Oh my god.

6471
03:49:09,090 --> 03:49:10,790
That was so freaky!

6472
03:49:11,190 --> 03:49:11,750
I was dead.

6473
03:49:11,850 --> 03:49:12,790
I was long dead.

6474
03:49:12,790 --> 03:49:13,690
Oh my god.

6475
03:49:13,810 --> 03:49:14,750
Oh my god.

6476
03:49:14,910 --> 03:49:18,110
We got the cat!

6477
03:49:18,350 --> 03:49:19,050
Good job!

6478
03:49:21,490 --> 03:49:24,390
Kiki changed colors a little bit.

6479
03:49:25,370 --> 03:49:26,270
There we go.

6480
03:49:26,570 --> 03:49:27,510
Must be a lighting.

6481
03:49:27,910 --> 03:49:28,990
Oh my gosh.

6482
03:49:29,090 --> 03:49:29,670
That was crazy.

6483
03:49:29,850 --> 03:49:31,330
That was so crazy.

6484
03:49:32,090 --> 03:49:34,170
I got killed by mimics or something.

6485
03:49:34,490 --> 03:49:35,770
I don't know, I saw...

6486
03:49:35,770 --> 03:49:37,650
I got killed by the jester.

6487
03:49:38,350 --> 03:49:39,130
Oh yeah.

6488
03:49:39,390 --> 03:49:41,970
Oh wait, I saw how you...

6489
03:49:42,790 --> 03:49:43,290
How did you die?

6490
03:49:43,390 --> 03:49:46,410
I watched you die.

6491
03:49:46,530 --> 03:49:47,070
No, please don't.

6492
03:49:47,430 --> 03:49:51,130
I saw that star and then I died.

6493
03:49:51,510 --> 03:49:53,530
I saw a red carpet.

6494
03:49:53,710 --> 03:49:54,170
Yeah, I know.

6495
03:49:54,270 --> 03:49:54,850
It was so shiny.

6496
03:49:58,550 --> 03:49:59,810
Oh my gosh.

6497
03:49:59,850 --> 03:50:01,090
Do you want to try it again?

6498
03:50:01,330 --> 03:50:01,610
Yeah!

6499
03:50:04,430 --> 03:50:05,390
Yeah, let's go back.

6500
03:50:05,770 --> 03:50:09,070
Now that we're here.

6501
03:50:09,070 --> 03:50:10,210
Oh my gosh.

6502
03:50:10,290 --> 03:50:11,030
That was so freaky.

6503
03:50:11,230 --> 03:50:13,350
That was so crazy timing.

6504
03:50:13,510 --> 03:50:15,110
I thought it was one of you.

6505
03:50:15,270 --> 03:50:15,950
Oh my gosh.

6506
03:50:15,950 --> 03:50:16,670
I was fooled.

6507
03:50:16,930 --> 03:50:18,170
I was entirely duped.

6508
03:50:18,190 --> 03:50:19,630
I didn't know it follows you back.

6509
03:50:19,970 --> 03:50:20,430
Yeah, it does.

6510
03:50:20,510 --> 03:50:21,650
They follow you all the way here.

6511
03:50:22,290 --> 03:50:23,170
That's crazy.

6512
03:50:24,430 --> 03:50:25,410
It's very scary.

6513
03:50:27,870 --> 03:50:28,310
Okay,

6514
03:50:31,390 --> 03:50:31,850
let's go.

6515
03:50:35,090 --> 03:50:35,950
Oh my gosh.

6516
03:50:35,950 --> 03:50:36,950
Thank you, Lord Croesus.

6517
03:50:38,330 --> 03:50:40,970
Oh my gosh.

6518
03:50:49,830 --> 03:50:49,830
Thank you, Lord Croesus.

6519
03:50:49,830 --> 03:50:50,130
Are we here?

6520
03:50:50,430 --> 03:50:50,890
Yes.

6521
03:50:50,990 --> 03:50:51,850
Wait, where is it?

6522
03:50:51,910 --> 03:50:52,190
Over here?

6523
03:50:53,110 --> 03:50:54,750
Oh, here it is.

6524
03:50:55,050 --> 03:50:57,230
I always can't remember where it is.

6525
03:50:57,950 --> 03:51:00,230
I wonder where the fire exit is for this.

6526
03:51:00,410 --> 03:51:00,890
Oh!

6527
03:51:01,590 --> 03:51:02,310
There's Freddy!

6528
03:51:03,230 --> 03:51:04,110
Oh my gosh!

6529
03:51:04,130 --> 03:51:05,130
Freddy, faster!

6530
03:51:05,550 --> 03:51:06,870
Freddy, faster!

6531
03:51:09,970 --> 03:51:11,250
Wait, what else am I carrying?

6532
03:51:11,430 --> 03:51:11,970
Oh, the hairbrush.

6533
03:51:12,010 --> 03:51:12,790
I forgot to put it down.

6534
03:51:13,790 --> 03:51:15,250
Magic 7 ball!

6535
03:51:15,770 --> 03:51:16,230
Wow!

6536
03:51:17,890 --> 03:51:19,230
It doesn't do anything.

6537
03:51:19,830 --> 03:51:20,230
Oh, there's something.

6538
03:51:20,410 --> 03:51:21,930
Watch out for traps!

6539
03:51:22,630 --> 03:51:23,670
Oh yeah, true, true, true.

6540
03:51:24,110 --> 03:51:24,490
Yes.

6541
03:51:25,130 --> 03:51:28,410
Oh, it's locked.

6542
03:51:28,790 --> 03:51:29,470
Oh, it's locked.

6543
03:51:30,270 --> 03:51:30,870
Go back.

6544
03:51:33,070 --> 03:51:36,890
Yeah, you get some of the more really crazy monsters in here.

6545
03:51:36,890 --> 03:51:38,010
Tell us where we should go.

6546
03:51:40,770 --> 03:51:43,010
Should I go this way?

6547
03:51:45,510 --> 03:51:46,890
I'm going this way.

6548
03:51:47,650 --> 03:51:48,250
Oh!

6549
03:51:50,230 --> 03:51:50,730
Emily!

6550
03:51:50,730 --> 03:51:51,110
Oh, what the heck?

6551
03:51:52,950 --> 03:51:53,450
Emily!

6552
03:51:54,070 --> 03:51:54,570
Hello!

6553
03:51:55,010 --> 03:51:55,930
Oh, Brass Bell!

6554
03:51:56,910 --> 03:51:58,170
Wait, oh, I got it.

6555
03:51:58,950 --> 03:51:59,850
It's just a...

6556
03:51:59,850 --> 03:52:02,170
I don't think there's anything else in here.

6557
03:52:03,210 --> 03:52:04,270
I'm kind of scared.

6558
03:52:05,770 --> 03:52:06,670
Go up?

6559
03:52:10,590 --> 03:52:12,750
There's another door over here, but I think it's been opened.

6560
03:52:15,190 --> 03:52:15,690
Whoa.

6561
03:52:17,530 --> 03:52:18,610
It's a beautiful night.

6562
03:52:20,870 --> 03:52:21,770
Perfume bottle.

6563
03:52:22,050 --> 03:52:23,990
Oh, nice.

6564
03:52:24,790 --> 03:52:25,090
Oh, wait.

6565
03:52:26,510 --> 03:52:27,470
There's two things here.

6566
03:52:27,550 --> 03:52:29,850
Oh, I got a key if we want to open that other door.

6567
03:52:30,210 --> 03:52:31,210
Oh, true, true, true, true.

6568
03:52:32,330 --> 03:52:33,190
Tea kettle.

6569
03:52:33,330 --> 03:52:34,150
Oh, there's a tea kettle.

6570
03:52:34,430 --> 03:52:37,010
Are you guys upstairs?

6571
03:52:37,450 --> 03:52:38,350
I'm actually loose this time.

6572
03:52:41,070 --> 03:52:42,310
I hear something.

6573
03:52:42,870 --> 03:52:43,710
I do too.

6574
03:52:44,310 --> 03:52:45,110
What do you hear?

6575
03:52:46,510 --> 03:52:47,570
Main steps, maybe?

6576
03:52:47,690 --> 03:52:48,050
What is that?

6577
03:52:49,630 --> 03:52:50,910
Oh, she spoke then.

6578
03:52:51,570 --> 03:52:51,950
Boo!

6579
03:52:52,710 --> 03:52:53,530
I'm good at that.

6580
03:52:55,910 --> 03:52:56,290
Alright.

6581
03:52:56,430 --> 03:52:57,710
The other direction?

6582
03:52:58,290 --> 03:52:59,310
Can I check the locked door?

6583
03:52:59,490 --> 03:53:00,910
Yeah, we can check the locked door.

6584
03:53:01,870 --> 03:53:02,650
Was it this way?

6585
03:53:03,030 --> 03:53:04,470
I think it was downstairs, right?

6586
03:53:04,590 --> 03:53:05,370
Yeah, it was downstairs.

6587
03:53:05,570 --> 03:53:07,710
Was it this one?

6588
03:53:10,510 --> 03:53:11,470
Yeah, it was over here.

6589
03:53:11,470 --> 03:53:12,550
There's a painting on the floor.

6590
03:53:12,610 --> 03:53:13,130
I didn't even notice.

6591
03:53:13,350 --> 03:53:14,830
I left it over there.

6592
03:53:16,990 --> 03:53:17,510
Okay.

6593
03:53:20,110 --> 03:53:20,890
Check that out.

6594
03:53:21,290 --> 03:53:21,810
Oh.

6595
03:53:21,910 --> 03:53:22,870
Another door.

6596
03:53:23,050 --> 03:53:24,570
Another locked door.

6597
03:53:25,090 --> 03:53:25,610
Wow.

6598
03:53:26,430 --> 03:53:30,770
Wow, big discovery, guys.

6599
03:53:31,670 --> 03:53:32,490
Nice going.

6600
03:53:32,790 --> 03:53:34,250
Another door behind us.

6601
03:53:35,410 --> 03:53:37,510
We got a good amount of loot.

6602
03:53:37,710 --> 03:53:38,230
Yeah.

6603
03:53:38,850 --> 03:53:40,090
Some outside too.

6604
03:53:42,530 --> 03:53:44,450
We don't put stuff outside, actually.

6605
03:53:44,790 --> 03:53:45,490
Yeah, yeah.

6606
03:53:45,750 --> 03:53:46,230
What was that?

6607
03:53:46,590 --> 03:53:49,430
I think it's the voice thing.

6608
03:53:49,510 --> 03:53:49,970
No, no.

6609
03:53:50,010 --> 03:53:52,150
I think I hear the guy.

6610
03:53:52,950 --> 03:53:53,910
The nutcracker.

6611
03:53:54,610 --> 03:53:55,090
Oh.

6612
03:53:56,750 --> 03:53:57,330
The who?

6613
03:53:57,570 --> 03:53:59,790
If you see the nutcracker, don't move.

6614
03:54:00,670 --> 03:54:01,150
Really?

6615
03:54:01,310 --> 03:54:01,670
Yeah.

6616
03:54:03,070 --> 03:54:04,590
I think he's up here.

6617
03:54:05,410 --> 03:54:06,090
Should we go?

6618
03:54:08,570 --> 03:54:09,590
Did Naki leave?

6619
03:54:09,710 --> 03:54:09,930
We could go.

6620
03:54:12,250 --> 03:54:12,970
She went ahead.

6621
03:54:13,630 --> 03:54:14,970
I think she went outside.

6622
03:54:15,410 --> 03:54:15,570
Oh.

6623
03:54:16,650 --> 03:54:17,230
All right.

6624
03:54:17,270 --> 03:54:18,850
Let's grab the hairbrush.

6625
03:54:19,710 --> 03:54:20,110
Okay.

6626
03:54:22,010 --> 03:54:23,810
There's some items on the floor here too.

6627
03:54:24,070 --> 03:54:24,490
Oh, okay.

6628
03:54:24,550 --> 03:54:24,990
I can grab them.

6629
03:54:25,490 --> 03:54:26,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6630
03:54:26,450 --> 03:54:27,510
And we can take them back.

6631
03:54:27,650 --> 03:54:28,110
All right.

6632
03:54:28,170 --> 03:54:28,490
Nice.

6633
03:54:28,990 --> 03:54:29,390
Okay.

6634
03:54:30,070 --> 03:54:30,950
Here we go.

6635
03:54:31,750 --> 03:54:32,650
Follow the light.

6636
03:54:33,330 --> 03:54:34,930
We will reach some bean.

6637
03:54:37,710 --> 03:54:38,270
Following.

6638
03:54:39,150 --> 03:54:39,710
Following.

6639
03:54:40,210 --> 03:54:41,350
It's so windy.

6640
03:54:42,290 --> 03:54:43,390
Following the light.

6641
03:54:51,970 --> 03:54:53,570
I can't see anything in there.

6642
03:54:55,110 --> 03:54:56,070
Interesting though.

6643
03:54:56,790 --> 03:54:58,070
It's a little safe house.

6644
03:54:59,990 --> 03:55:01,230
Follow the light.

6645
03:55:01,510 --> 03:55:02,930
Usually they say don't follow the light.

6646
03:55:03,050 --> 03:55:03,450
She's not moving.

6647
03:55:04,210 --> 03:55:05,210
Yeah, she's not moving.

6648
03:55:05,470 --> 03:55:06,210
Wait, where is she?

6649
03:55:06,430 --> 03:55:08,290
I don't know.

6650
03:55:10,450 --> 03:55:11,390
Wait, was the painting expensive?

6651
03:55:12,310 --> 03:55:12,970
Yeah, it was $100.

6652
03:55:12,970 --> 03:55:13,770
They usually are, yeah.

6653
03:55:14,330 --> 03:55:17,090
Wait, where did she leave from?

6654
03:55:19,210 --> 03:55:20,210
Is this outside?

6655
03:55:20,890 --> 03:55:21,450
It's not moving.

6656
03:55:22,010 --> 03:55:22,810
I think it's outside.

6657
03:55:22,810 --> 03:55:23,710
Yeah, it looks like it's outside.

6658
03:55:25,010 --> 03:55:26,110
But how did she die?

6659
03:55:28,570 --> 03:55:29,470
I don't know.

6660
03:55:29,830 --> 03:55:31,110
We have a lot of money.

6661
03:55:31,270 --> 03:55:32,810
Do you want to go or do you want to go look for her?

6662
03:55:34,110 --> 03:55:35,770
Like $400 on the ship.

6663
03:55:35,970 --> 03:55:38,130
We can probably go and then just come back again.

6664
03:55:38,910 --> 03:55:39,270
Yeah.

6665
03:55:40,450 --> 03:55:41,870
Oh, it could have been the ghost girl.

6666
03:55:43,410 --> 03:55:44,370
Oh, yeah.

6667
03:55:44,630 --> 03:55:45,790
I forgot about like the...

6668
03:55:45,790 --> 03:55:49,370
Oh, someone says it looks like she found the fire exit and then fell.

6669
03:55:50,370 --> 03:55:50,690
Oh, fuck.

6670
03:55:52,570 --> 03:55:53,050
Whoopsie.

6671
03:55:54,410 --> 03:55:54,890
Oopsie.

6672
03:55:56,590 --> 03:56:00,190
Yeah, I think we could go and then just come back again.

6673
03:56:00,450 --> 03:56:01,670
We looted a lot.

6674
03:56:02,390 --> 03:56:02,870
Okay.

6675
03:56:05,530 --> 03:56:07,530
I want to see the ghost girl.

6676
03:56:09,450 --> 03:56:09,930
Yeah.

6677
03:56:10,070 --> 03:56:12,010
I saw her before.

6678
03:56:12,190 --> 03:56:12,850
She killed me.

6679
03:56:12,950 --> 03:56:13,590
Wait, she killed you?

6680
03:56:14,670 --> 03:56:16,910
Yeah, I think I died from ghost girl before.

6681
03:56:17,230 --> 03:56:17,890
Like earlier?

6682
03:56:18,330 --> 03:56:19,850
No, no, no.

6683
03:56:19,850 --> 03:56:20,930
When I played before.

6684
03:56:21,110 --> 03:56:21,730
Oh, okay.

6685
03:56:21,950 --> 03:56:25,570
It was like a jump scare kill too.

6686
03:56:25,910 --> 03:56:26,610
Came out of nowhere.

6687
03:56:26,930 --> 03:56:27,730
Oh my gosh.

6688
03:56:27,810 --> 03:56:28,290
Freaky.

6689
03:56:28,370 --> 03:56:30,250
She like makes you go insane and then you die.

6690
03:56:31,370 --> 03:56:32,290
Welcome back.

6691
03:56:34,110 --> 03:56:37,310
I accidentally used Easter egg and it threw me.

6692
03:56:37,310 --> 03:56:37,550
Sweet.

6693
03:56:39,550 --> 03:56:40,850
Wait, it can do that?

6694
03:56:46,300 --> 03:56:47,180
It exploded.

6695
03:56:48,040 --> 03:56:48,980
Oh, yeah.

6696
03:56:49,120 --> 03:56:50,340
It'll explode sometimes.

6697
03:56:50,760 --> 03:56:50,940
Yeah.

6698
03:56:52,780 --> 03:56:53,220
Okay.

6699
03:56:59,360 --> 03:57:00,360
Last run.

6700
03:57:00,460 --> 03:57:02,160
Maybe that's what I died to last time.

6701
03:57:02,280 --> 03:57:05,500
I was carrying an Easter egg and I think it might have exploded on me just randomly.

6702
03:57:05,760 --> 03:57:06,100
Oops.

6703
03:57:06,920 --> 03:57:07,680
I didn't know.

6704
03:57:07,980 --> 03:57:09,040
You explode yourself.

6705
03:57:09,220 --> 03:57:09,620
Oh, maybe.

6706
03:57:10,700 --> 03:57:11,120
That's what it was.

6707
03:57:11,120 --> 03:57:12,980
In case I don't come back.

6708
03:57:13,680 --> 03:57:14,540
That's what it was.

6709
03:57:15,440 --> 03:57:16,720
I love you, Kiki.

6710
03:57:16,860 --> 03:57:17,760
In case I don't come back.

6711
03:57:18,280 --> 03:57:19,060
See you later.

6712
03:57:34,780 --> 03:57:35,520
I'll be here.

6713
03:57:36,720 --> 03:57:37,400
Yeah, yeah.

6714
03:57:37,400 --> 03:57:37,960
You gotta go up.

6715
03:57:38,360 --> 03:57:38,800
Wait.

6716
03:57:39,180 --> 03:57:39,780
Yeah, yeah.

6717
03:57:39,780 --> 03:57:40,120
You're right.

6718
03:57:41,280 --> 03:57:42,160
Right here.

6719
03:57:43,520 --> 03:57:44,080
It's here.

6720
03:57:44,360 --> 03:57:44,360
It's here.

6721
03:57:44,820 --> 03:57:45,780
It's so hard to see.

6722
03:57:48,180 --> 03:57:49,060
Oh, man.

6723
03:57:49,540 --> 03:57:50,920
This is not a mansion.

6724
03:57:51,760 --> 03:57:53,680
Wait, there's a comedy mask somewhere.

6725
03:57:55,500 --> 03:57:56,520
Where is it?

6726
03:57:56,600 --> 03:57:56,680
I don't know.

6727
03:57:57,180 --> 03:57:58,400
I scanned it.

6728
03:57:58,500 --> 03:57:59,160
I scanned it.

6729
03:57:59,440 --> 03:58:00,420
Oh, oh, oh.

6730
03:58:01,480 --> 03:58:02,200
Where'd it go?

6731
03:58:02,980 --> 03:58:04,020
For comedy.

6732
03:58:04,440 --> 03:58:05,980
Maybe it's like on a ledge.

6733
03:58:06,320 --> 03:58:06,980
Might be.

6734
03:58:07,440 --> 03:58:08,340
Wait, where'd it go?

6735
03:58:08,460 --> 03:58:09,640
Wait, who picked it up?

6736
03:58:09,680 --> 03:58:11,060
Someone picked it up.

6737
03:58:11,600 --> 03:58:12,720
I didn't pick it up.

6738
03:58:13,220 --> 03:58:13,980
Not me.

6739
03:58:14,260 --> 03:58:15,420
I have a hairbrush.

6740
03:58:16,580 --> 03:58:17,100
Sauce.

6741
03:58:17,560 --> 03:58:18,080
Sauce.

6742
03:58:20,000 --> 03:58:21,780
I should not just see things.

6743
03:58:21,780 --> 03:58:22,560
Sauce.

6744
03:58:24,340 --> 03:58:25,000
Hello?

6745
03:58:25,440 --> 03:58:26,100
Hello?

6746
03:58:27,320 --> 03:58:28,860
Did you pick up a mask?

6747
03:58:30,080 --> 03:58:30,740
What?

6748
03:58:31,680 --> 03:58:32,340
Yeah?

6749
03:58:33,340 --> 03:58:34,120
There's nothing here.

6750
03:58:34,720 --> 03:58:35,140
No.

6751
03:58:35,480 --> 03:58:36,140
Alright.

6752
03:58:38,540 --> 03:58:40,400
Maybe the mask was just flying around.

6753
03:58:40,580 --> 03:58:41,140
It was there.

6754
03:58:41,660 --> 03:58:43,060
Now it's gone.

6755
03:58:44,440 --> 03:58:45,760
How suspicious.

6756
03:58:46,920 --> 03:58:48,840
When the imposter is sauce.

6757
03:58:51,820 --> 03:58:52,420
Amogus.

6758
03:58:52,760 --> 03:58:53,360
Amogus.

6759
03:58:54,820 --> 03:58:56,200
Was there anything?

6760
03:58:56,320 --> 03:58:57,100
Oh, we went here already.

6761
03:58:57,700 --> 03:58:58,300
Yeah.

6762
03:58:58,300 --> 03:58:58,880
Oh, yeah.

6763
03:58:59,540 --> 03:59:00,800
Okay, the other way.

6764
03:59:00,960 --> 03:59:01,740
The other way.

6765
03:59:03,340 --> 03:59:04,000
Let's go.

6766
03:59:10,440 --> 03:59:11,640
Another maze.

6767
03:59:12,940 --> 03:59:14,740
Maze after maze after maze.

6768
03:59:16,860 --> 03:59:17,900
Oh, hello.

6769
03:59:19,340 --> 03:59:19,940
Um.

6770
03:59:21,980 --> 03:59:22,580
Parkour?

6771
03:59:22,820 --> 03:59:24,540
I think we can walk around it.

6772
03:59:26,140 --> 03:59:26,740
Maybe.

6773
03:59:26,820 --> 03:59:28,440
Sometimes we can.

6774
03:59:30,100 --> 03:59:30,700
Hello?

6775
03:59:31,840 --> 03:59:32,300
Hello?

6776
03:59:32,480 --> 03:59:33,080
Hello?

6777
03:59:33,100 --> 03:59:33,520
Hello?

6778
03:59:36,680 --> 03:59:38,760
Are we going in circles?

6779
03:59:39,680 --> 03:59:40,280
It's...

6780
03:59:41,340 --> 03:59:42,380
Oh, there's a painting.

6781
03:59:42,800 --> 03:59:44,340
Oh, this is somewhere near.

6782
03:59:45,500 --> 03:59:46,640
There's like nothing here.

6783
03:59:47,140 --> 03:59:49,300
But there's a painting.

6784
03:59:49,420 --> 03:59:50,220
That's worth a lot.

6785
03:59:50,440 --> 03:59:51,120
Yeah, usually.

6786
03:59:51,780 --> 03:59:52,000
Yeah.

6787
03:59:52,880 --> 03:59:54,700
Alright, now we just gotta find a way out.

6788
03:59:54,880 --> 03:59:55,360
Oh, there's a key.

6789
03:59:55,540 --> 03:59:55,800
Yeah.

6790
03:59:56,060 --> 03:59:56,700
Oh, there's a key.

6791
03:59:57,180 --> 03:59:58,380
If I can grab it.

6792
03:59:58,420 --> 03:59:59,180
I got it.

6793
04:00:00,520 --> 04:00:01,780
So hard to see.

6794
04:00:03,220 --> 04:00:03,660
Uh.

6795
04:00:03,920 --> 04:00:05,020
Can we go through this door?

6796
04:00:05,880 --> 04:00:07,340
Is there a cave here?

6797
04:00:08,560 --> 04:00:10,680
Looks a little foggy.

6798
04:00:11,480 --> 04:00:11,920
Yeah.

6799
04:00:11,960 --> 04:00:13,560
It's a little foggy.

6800
04:00:16,230 --> 04:00:17,870
Nah, I don't think we want through here.

6801
04:00:19,190 --> 04:00:19,630
Um.

6802
04:00:20,030 --> 04:00:20,950
I went in.

6803
04:00:21,130 --> 04:00:21,570
Oh.

6804
04:00:23,430 --> 04:00:24,870
Maybe we can find the thing.

6805
04:00:25,970 --> 04:00:26,890
What's that sound?

6806
04:00:28,210 --> 04:00:28,470
Um.

6807
04:00:28,550 --> 04:00:28,810
Um.

6808
04:00:28,970 --> 04:00:29,290
Um.

6809
04:00:29,350 --> 04:00:29,650
Um.

6810
04:00:29,650 --> 04:00:29,930
Um.

6811
04:00:30,970 --> 04:00:32,310
I don't have to be good.

6812
04:00:33,690 --> 04:00:34,330
That key?

6813
04:00:34,490 --> 04:00:35,690
I turned it off.

6814
04:00:36,530 --> 04:00:37,250
Oh, nice!

6815
04:00:38,610 --> 04:00:39,690
Good job, good job.

6816
04:00:40,750 --> 04:00:41,750
Now I can't...

6817
04:00:41,750 --> 04:00:42,430
Oh, no.

6818
04:00:44,030 --> 04:00:45,590
I think we're really lost.

6819
04:00:47,010 --> 04:00:47,950
I think we're really lost.

6820
04:00:48,850 --> 04:00:49,470
Uh oh.

6821
04:00:50,530 --> 04:00:51,490
Somewhere close.

6822
04:00:52,210 --> 04:00:53,050
Oh, there you are.

6823
04:00:53,430 --> 04:00:54,750
Yeah, we've been following you.

6824
04:00:55,050 --> 04:00:55,510
Hahaha.

6825
04:00:56,070 --> 04:00:56,370
No,

6826
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:01,940
this is where we came from, right?

6827
04:01:02,160 --> 04:01:02,840
Over here?

6828
04:01:03,700 --> 04:01:05,920
I was going back to find you.

6829
04:01:06,600 --> 04:01:07,080
Oh.

6830
04:01:07,100 --> 04:01:07,460
Oh.

6831
04:01:07,540 --> 04:01:09,620
Oh, there's a dead end here.

6832
04:01:09,800 --> 04:01:09,980
Haha.

6833
04:01:12,120 --> 04:01:16,860
Yeah, it sure looks like the area we looked around earlier.

6834
04:01:17,300 --> 04:01:17,660
No.

6835
04:01:17,920 --> 04:01:20,100
I knew that was a dead end.

6836
04:01:20,120 --> 04:01:20,900
I was just confirming.

6837
04:01:22,580 --> 04:01:23,060
There.

6838
04:01:23,060 --> 04:01:23,720
Oh.

6839
04:01:24,640 --> 04:01:25,980
That's where we came from?

6840
04:01:26,740 --> 04:01:28,560
No, there's two...

6841
04:01:28,560 --> 04:01:29,180
Oh.

6842
04:01:30,280 --> 04:01:30,840
Hahaha.

6843
04:01:33,220 --> 04:01:35,460
Maybe we can just go back to where we came from.

6844
04:01:35,540 --> 04:01:36,580
Can't we even go back?

6845
04:01:39,000 --> 04:01:40,420
Got some bottles.

6846
04:01:43,120 --> 04:01:43,960
New area.

6847
04:01:45,460 --> 04:01:46,460
They're not gonna follow?

6848
04:01:47,940 --> 04:01:49,060
Trust your nose.

6849
04:01:50,840 --> 04:01:52,060
Oh, hair dryer.

6850
04:01:53,680 --> 04:01:54,440
Big bolt.

6851
04:01:54,600 --> 04:01:55,440
Oh, there's a lot here.

6852
04:01:56,680 --> 04:01:57,160
Hello?

6853
04:01:58,540 --> 04:01:59,340
Are you real?

6854
04:02:00,900 --> 04:02:01,760
Oh, there you go.

6855
04:02:02,440 --> 04:02:03,260
Are you real?

6856
04:02:04,340 --> 04:02:05,000
Oh, hello.

6857
04:02:05,680 --> 04:02:06,440
Yeah, yeah.

6858
04:02:06,480 --> 04:02:07,240
I thought you weren't.

6859
04:02:07,360 --> 04:02:08,400
Nice, nice, nice.

6860
04:02:08,580 --> 04:02:09,600
Oh, there's some items.

6861
04:02:10,240 --> 04:02:10,720
Bottles.

6862
04:02:10,780 --> 04:02:11,480
Yeah, you can get that.

6863
04:02:11,880 --> 04:02:13,140
Is that hair dryer?

6864
04:02:13,880 --> 04:02:16,740
Oh, that's fun.

6865
04:02:16,780 --> 04:02:18,320
It actually works.

6866
04:02:18,440 --> 04:02:20,780
I think I hear something though.

6867
04:02:21,100 --> 04:02:21,140
That's so cool.

6868
04:02:23,060 --> 04:02:24,120
I'm gonna try to find a way out.

6869
04:02:25,220 --> 04:02:26,080
Wherever it is.

6870
04:02:26,400 --> 04:02:28,760
There's sometimes a fire escape over here.

6871
04:02:28,980 --> 04:02:29,720
Oh, there's a present!

6872
04:02:29,800 --> 04:02:30,320
There's a present!

6873
04:02:30,940 --> 04:02:31,360
Gotcha!

6874
04:02:32,860 --> 04:02:33,480
I can't hold it.

6875
04:02:34,300 --> 04:02:35,420
Yeah, I can't hold it.

6876
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:36,900
Oh, and a hair brush.

6877
04:02:38,580 --> 04:02:39,560
What is that?

6878
04:02:40,160 --> 04:02:43,140
Um, um, um, um, um...

6879
04:02:43,140 --> 04:02:43,880
What's there?

6880
04:02:44,600 --> 04:02:45,140
What's there?

6881
04:02:45,360 --> 04:02:46,020
Is it the bracken?

6882
04:02:47,500 --> 04:02:48,460
Is it the bracken?

6883
04:02:50,220 --> 04:02:50,740
Goku?

6884
04:02:50,920 --> 04:02:52,380
We have to go back.

6885
04:02:52,520 --> 04:02:53,360
Oh, okay, okay.

6886
04:02:54,080 --> 04:02:54,600
Goku?

6887
04:02:55,300 --> 04:02:56,620
It's to our left.

6888
04:02:57,780 --> 04:02:59,200
Should I open?

6889
04:02:59,360 --> 04:02:59,880
Should I open?

6890
04:03:00,040 --> 04:03:00,640
I have really...

6891
04:03:00,640 --> 04:03:02,340
Open it!

6892
04:03:02,800 --> 04:03:03,320
Yeah!

6893
04:03:07,180 --> 04:03:07,700
Wow!

6894
04:03:08,300 --> 04:03:09,600
Another hair dryer!

6895
04:03:10,780 --> 04:03:12,100
Another hair dryer!

6896
04:03:13,480 --> 04:03:14,260
Oh my gosh.

6897
04:03:14,300 --> 04:03:15,180
Wait, how do we leave?

6898
04:03:15,180 --> 04:03:16,060
Um...

6899
04:03:16,060 --> 04:03:17,080
Oh my god!

6900
04:03:20,040 --> 04:03:21,300
He's opening the door!

6901
04:03:21,420 --> 04:03:22,760
Who opened the door?

6902
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:24,120
What's over there?

6903
04:03:25,760 --> 04:03:26,300
Um...

6904
04:03:27,060 --> 04:03:28,940
Do you guys see that?

6905
04:03:29,260 --> 04:03:29,920
See what?

6906
04:03:31,220 --> 04:03:32,780
There's a ghost girl!

6907
04:03:33,240 --> 04:03:34,380
You saw a ghost girl!

6908
04:03:34,820 --> 04:03:35,740
That's only you.

6909
04:03:35,960 --> 04:03:39,840
It's only for me?

6910
04:03:40,180 --> 04:03:41,700
No, that's only for you.

6911
04:03:42,660 --> 04:03:43,700
I see it!

6912
04:03:44,240 --> 04:03:45,160
I see it!

6913
04:03:51,070 --> 04:03:52,370
Oh no, it's a...

6914
04:04:02,570 --> 04:04:03,670
I'm coming with you!

6915
04:04:05,890 --> 04:04:07,630
Go, go, go, go!

6916
04:04:08,250 --> 04:04:08,770
I

6917
04:04:13,690 --> 04:04:14,450
can't help you!

6918
04:04:14,710 --> 04:04:16,370
No, I'm gonna die to the trap!

6919
04:04:16,970 --> 04:04:17,010
No!

6920
04:04:34,230 --> 04:04:34,750
Kiki!

6921
04:04:40,830 --> 04:04:41,350
The

6922
04:04:48,000 --> 04:04:49,720
bugs came down from the ceiling.

6923
04:04:51,600 --> 04:04:55,960
Oh my god.

6924
04:04:56,920 --> 04:04:57,720
They even made the jump!

6925
04:04:58,240 --> 04:04:59,580
Oh my gosh!

6926
04:05:00,600 --> 04:05:02,320
That was so crazy!

6927
04:05:02,640 --> 04:05:03,580
All at once!

6928
04:05:03,600 --> 04:05:06,200
Did the ghost girl kill you?

6929
04:05:06,720 --> 04:05:08,300
Yeah, it killed me, the ghost girl.

6930
04:05:08,660 --> 04:05:10,100
Three different things.

6931
04:05:10,360 --> 04:05:10,680
I know!

6932
04:05:11,280 --> 04:05:13,540
Like, they're all hugging you.

6933
04:05:13,680 --> 04:05:17,680
I couldn't continue forward because the trap would have crushed me.

6934
04:05:17,760 --> 04:05:20,660
And then the two mimics were blocking the other way.

6935
04:05:21,140 --> 04:05:21,240
Yeah!

6936
04:05:21,240 --> 04:05:21,500
Yeah!

6937
04:05:22,480 --> 04:05:23,260
I saw!

6938
04:05:24,240 --> 04:05:25,720
What the heck?

6939
04:05:26,920 --> 04:05:30,420
I hope Kiki gets lots of love wherever they go.

6940
04:05:30,680 --> 04:05:32,280
Oh yeah, Kiki.

6941
04:05:32,840 --> 04:05:33,800
Oh no!

6942
04:05:35,140 --> 04:05:35,900
It's okay.

6943
04:05:37,680 --> 04:05:39,340
We were doing so well.

6944
04:05:40,100 --> 04:05:41,200
Yeah, we were.

6945
04:05:41,640 --> 04:05:41,680
We were.

6946
04:05:42,180 --> 04:05:43,020
Oh well.

6947
04:05:43,600 --> 04:05:46,020
Well, maybe we'll find another Kiki.

6948
04:05:46,200 --> 04:05:48,260
Yeah, find another Kiki.

6949
04:05:48,960 --> 04:05:50,260
Wanna go to the same place?

6950
04:05:51,120 --> 04:05:51,960
Oh yeah!

6951
04:05:53,320 --> 04:05:55,920
This is to you, Rend!

6952
04:05:55,920 --> 04:05:59,040
Oh wait, we have to go sell now.

6953
04:05:59,220 --> 04:05:59,980
Never mind.

6954
04:06:00,380 --> 04:06:02,020
No, it'll let us, right?

6955
04:06:02,160 --> 04:06:02,920
It'll let us.

6956
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:04,620
Oh, it'll let us.

6957
04:06:04,680 --> 04:06:06,080
Yeah, we just gotta hold it down.

6958
04:06:07,520 --> 04:06:08,040
Yeah!

6959
04:06:09,840 --> 04:06:11,180
One more mention!

6960
04:06:11,840 --> 04:06:13,840
Maybe we'll get the new monster.

6961
04:06:15,300 --> 04:06:16,160
I hope so.

6962
04:06:17,180 --> 04:06:18,780
No free Rend, no Kiki.

6963
04:06:20,860 --> 04:06:22,120
We lost them all.

6964
04:06:22,820 --> 04:06:23,860
It's eclipsed?

6965
04:06:23,900 --> 04:06:25,540
Oh, we're so boned.

6966
04:06:25,920 --> 04:06:26,520
Oh, is it?

6967
04:06:27,880 --> 04:06:28,400
What?

6968
04:06:28,400 --> 04:06:30,100
Is it eclipsed?

6969
04:06:30,780 --> 04:06:31,300
Yeah.

6970
04:06:32,520 --> 04:06:33,560
Wait, do you see the moon?

6971
04:06:33,740 --> 04:06:35,220
This might be the best run yet.

6972
04:06:37,260 --> 04:06:38,880
Last one best run?

6973
04:06:39,480 --> 04:06:40,500
Last one best run?

6974
04:06:40,780 --> 04:06:42,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6975
04:06:43,020 --> 04:06:43,560
Let's go!

6976
04:06:51,660 --> 04:06:52,180
I

6977
04:07:36,940 --> 04:07:38,500
don't trust eclipsed.

6978
04:07:38,860 --> 04:07:40,640
Whoa, it's so dark!

6979
04:07:40,680 --> 04:07:41,060
It's so dark in here.

6980
04:07:42,260 --> 04:07:42,840
Yeah, yeah.

6981
04:07:43,040 --> 04:07:44,360
I thought you died.

6982
04:07:44,640 --> 04:07:45,020
No.

6983
04:07:46,640 --> 04:07:49,160
But because it's eclipsed, I was like...

6984
04:07:49,160 --> 04:07:50,940
I was trying to be sneaky.

6985
04:07:52,360 --> 04:07:52,880
Oh.

6986
04:07:53,080 --> 04:07:53,560
Sneaky.

6987
04:07:54,960 --> 04:07:56,000
High voltage.

6988
04:07:57,880 --> 04:08:00,500
Wait, maybe we can turn the lights on.

6989
04:08:00,660 --> 04:08:00,940
Oh, yeah.

6990
04:08:01,080 --> 04:08:01,800
Yeah, yeah.

6991
04:08:03,220 --> 04:08:04,560
How do we do this?

6992
04:08:04,580 --> 04:08:05,260
Flip switch.

6993
04:08:05,580 --> 04:08:05,880
E?

6994
04:08:08,440 --> 04:08:09,820
Oh, there we go.

6995
04:08:10,280 --> 04:08:10,960
Oh, yeah.

6996
04:08:10,980 --> 04:08:11,800
We got some lights on.

6997
04:08:12,000 --> 04:08:12,520
Nice.

6998
04:08:13,060 --> 04:08:13,980
Okay, nice.

6999
04:08:15,200 --> 04:08:15,980
Nice, nice.

7000
04:08:16,460 --> 04:08:18,760
Mama mia.

7001
04:08:20,240 --> 04:08:20,960
Oh, man.

7002
04:08:21,980 --> 04:08:23,120
You're not my brother.

7003
04:08:24,880 --> 04:08:27,620
Oh, there's just a single key in the middle of the floor.

7004
04:08:28,140 --> 04:08:28,660
Whoa.

7005
04:08:29,860 --> 04:08:30,380
Whoa.

7006
04:08:31,340 --> 04:08:32,980
Okay, I grabbed it.

7007
04:08:32,980 --> 04:08:33,280
Nice.

7008
04:08:34,620 --> 04:08:35,580
Mission accomplished.

7009
04:08:36,680 --> 04:08:37,160
Whoa.

7010
04:08:37,640 --> 04:08:39,080
That's a really big chair.

7011
04:08:41,680 --> 04:08:42,160
Scanning.

7012
04:08:42,460 --> 04:08:42,940
Scanning.

7013
04:08:43,000 --> 04:08:43,420
Very headed.

7014
04:08:44,780 --> 04:08:45,740
Mm-hmm.

7015
04:08:45,960 --> 04:08:46,940
Oh, it goes around.

7016
04:08:47,180 --> 04:08:47,600
Okay.

7017
04:08:48,140 --> 04:08:49,340
Oh, this is where we came from.

7018
04:08:49,420 --> 04:08:49,700
Okay.

7019
04:08:49,800 --> 04:08:50,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7020
04:08:50,480 --> 04:08:51,060
Go down.

7021
04:08:51,180 --> 04:08:51,920
Yeah, go down.

7022
04:08:52,740 --> 04:08:53,220
Okay.

7023
04:08:53,300 --> 04:08:55,700
Maybe we'll have some lights on now over here.

7024
04:08:56,300 --> 04:08:57,220
Where am I?

7025
04:08:57,280 --> 04:08:57,760
Where am I?

7026
04:08:57,760 --> 04:08:58,500
In the main room.

7027
04:08:58,700 --> 04:09:01,200
Yeah, this looks right.

7028
04:09:01,740 --> 04:09:02,820
There's the main room.

7029
04:09:02,820 --> 04:09:04,900
Yeah, we got the lights.

7030
04:09:05,020 --> 04:09:05,620
Nice.

7031
04:09:06,600 --> 04:09:07,640
Oh, there's bottles.

7032
04:09:08,180 --> 04:09:08,780
Oh.

7033
04:09:09,300 --> 04:09:10,640
Didn't even notice it.

7034
04:09:14,020 --> 04:09:15,360
We locked doors.

7035
04:09:15,640 --> 04:09:16,280
Oh, there's Freddy.

7036
04:09:16,700 --> 04:09:17,680
Oh, my God.

7037
04:09:17,720 --> 04:09:18,380
It's Rainbow.

7038
04:09:20,640 --> 04:09:22,460
Oh, my God.

7039
04:09:22,460 --> 04:09:23,340
Oh, my God.

7040
04:09:49,880 --> 04:09:51,440
The precious thing.

7041
04:09:54,720 --> 04:09:56,100
Minto stole the precious thing.

7042
04:10:01,580 --> 04:10:03,000
What's going on?

7043
04:10:03,360 --> 04:10:03,460
What's going on?

7044
04:10:04,660 --> 04:10:06,720
What's going on?

7045
04:10:07,120 --> 04:10:09,780
What are you doing?

7046
04:10:09,900 --> 04:10:11,260
What are you doing?

7047
04:10:12,160 --> 04:10:13,200
Oh, my God.

7048
04:10:18,750 --> 04:10:21,370
Why don't you love me more?

7049
04:10:24,490 --> 04:10:25,130
Here,

7050
04:10:28,450 --> 04:10:29,410
someone else wants her.

7051
04:10:31,710 --> 04:10:32,990
Guys, Naki died.

7052
04:10:33,150 --> 04:10:34,210
Did Naki die?

7053
04:10:34,610 --> 04:10:35,250
Yeah.

7054
04:10:35,510 --> 04:10:35,830
Yeah.

7055
04:10:35,970 --> 04:10:36,630
Might have.

7056
04:10:40,440 --> 04:10:41,480
I hear him.

7057
04:10:52,030 --> 04:10:54,710
Do I live with Reimu or...

7058
04:10:56,410 --> 04:10:57,870
Nah, we're gonna go back in.

7059
04:11:00,610 --> 04:11:01,850
If I die...

7060
04:11:05,240 --> 04:11:06,700
I don't think this area...

7061
04:11:06,700 --> 04:11:07,240
Yeah, this...

7062
04:11:07,760 --> 04:11:08,600
Oh no!

7063
04:11:08,920 --> 04:11:10,140
There's also the Yippies.

7064
04:11:10,380 --> 04:11:11,140
Wait, what's this?

7065
04:11:12,200 --> 04:11:13,440
Oh, this is another vent.

7066
04:11:15,020 --> 04:11:16,660
The Yippies are also on the loose.

7067
04:11:19,620 --> 04:11:21,040
Maybe that's why there's no items.

7068
04:11:26,920 --> 04:11:27,720
Why is there music?

7069
04:11:30,540 --> 04:11:32,180
It's so scary for no reason!

7070
04:11:32,240 --> 04:11:32,740
Oh, it's locked.

7071
04:11:32,940 --> 04:11:33,200
Wait!

7072
04:11:33,320 --> 04:11:34,200
Oh, I had a key.

7073
04:11:34,380 --> 04:11:35,480
I think in the last life.

7074
04:11:43,940 --> 04:11:45,600
You guys heard that music, right?

7075
04:11:58,960 --> 04:11:59,700
The heck was that?

7076
04:12:02,000 --> 04:12:02,880
It was like a...

7077
04:12:06,610 --> 04:12:07,670
What was that sound?

7078
04:12:11,650 --> 04:12:13,490
Do you guys actually not hear the ambience?

7079
04:12:13,730 --> 04:12:17,090
I mean, I think I do have the game kinda turned down low-ish because the...

7080
04:12:17,090 --> 04:12:19,490
voices can get kinda loud, but...

7081
04:12:23,400 --> 04:12:25,300
Maybe I'm the only one hearing the ambience.

7082
04:12:30,840 --> 04:12:32,040
See, you can't hear that?

7083
04:12:44,020 --> 04:12:45,260
What is that sound?

7084
04:12:46,600 --> 04:12:47,860
That is cheap!

7085
04:12:48,840 --> 04:12:51,020
Are those teeth in the middle of a trap?

7086
04:12:59,930 --> 04:13:01,630
I got my chompers!

7087
04:13:02,550 --> 04:13:03,710
You can't scare me!

7088
04:13:06,690 --> 04:13:07,250
My

7089
04:13:11,020 --> 04:13:11,580
chompers!

7090
04:13:12,560 --> 04:13:14,060
You can't scare me!

7091
04:13:14,440 --> 04:13:15,580
What am I hearing?

7092
04:13:21,370 --> 04:13:23,670
Actually, I have no idea what I'm hearing.

7093
04:13:24,990 --> 04:13:27,230
You guys heard the slimy thing too, right?

7094
04:13:27,590 --> 04:13:28,770
Am I going crazy?

7095
04:13:30,230 --> 04:13:31,450
There's actually nothing here.

7096
04:13:40,700 --> 04:13:41,780
He's a janitor!

7097
04:13:42,380 --> 04:13:42,940
Wait!

7098
04:13:43,060 --> 04:13:43,820
I'm a maid!

7099
04:13:46,140 --> 04:13:47,200
Wait, what is he?

7100
04:13:47,400 --> 04:13:48,480
The butler?

7101
04:13:55,450 --> 04:13:57,330
He will kill if you are alone!

7102
04:13:58,450 --> 04:13:59,690
That's so evil!

7103
04:14:00,190 --> 04:14:00,930
Oh my gosh!

7104
04:14:01,050 --> 04:14:02,430
I've never seen him before!

7105
04:14:05,070 --> 04:14:05,710
Oh my god!

7106
04:14:37,000 --> 04:14:38,860
I'm actually not sure if he's a new guy or not.

7107
04:14:40,820 --> 04:14:41,900
But he seems new.

7108
04:14:43,680 --> 04:14:44,780
Doesn't seem like a mod.

7109
04:14:47,340 --> 04:14:48,660
He's not following me right now.

7110
04:15:27,300 --> 04:15:28,180
What's that sound?

7111
04:15:29,600 --> 04:15:30,960
Kind of sounds like bugs.

7112
04:15:31,040 --> 04:15:33,100
Like, scrittling around.

7113
04:15:37,680 --> 04:15:39,580
I don't know why they're dead!

7114
04:15:39,840 --> 04:15:41,200
I have no idea.

7115
04:15:43,700 --> 04:15:46,620
It's okay, don't- it doesn't matter if we grab anything.

7116
04:15:46,860 --> 04:15:47,640
It was the last day.

7117
04:15:49,920 --> 04:15:51,920
It doesn't matter if it was- Oh that's true.

7118
04:15:52,320 --> 04:15:52,980
Let's go!

7119
04:15:53,440 --> 04:15:53,880
Yay!

7120
04:15:54,420 --> 04:15:54,980
What?

7121
04:15:54,980 --> 04:15:55,880
We are back to the dog.

7122
04:15:56,260 --> 04:15:56,980
Yeah.

7123
04:15:58,020 --> 04:15:58,740
Yeah.

7124
04:15:59,140 --> 04:16:00,740
We got Reimu, though.

7125
04:16:00,780 --> 04:16:02,200
I'm glad you saved her.

7126
04:16:02,800 --> 04:16:04,120
Can I die with Reimu?

7127
04:16:04,740 --> 04:16:05,680
You did what you could.

7128
04:16:06,180 --> 04:16:06,600
Yeah.

7129
04:16:06,920 --> 04:16:10,260
Bye, Reimu.

7130
04:16:10,400 --> 04:16:11,760
Goodbye, everybody.

7131
04:16:12,180 --> 04:16:12,420
Goodbye!

7132
04:16:13,100 --> 04:16:14,980
It was nice knowing you!

7133
04:16:19,250 --> 04:16:19,970
Reimu!

7134
04:16:21,910 --> 04:16:23,810
She left me.

7135
04:16:29,590 --> 04:16:29,930
No!

7136
04:16:30,970 --> 04:16:31,650
Reimu!

7137
04:16:32,110 --> 04:16:32,790
Goodbye.

7138
04:16:33,290 --> 04:16:33,970
Hello.

7139
04:16:35,770 --> 04:16:36,830
Fifteen deaths.

7140
04:16:37,270 --> 04:16:38,370
Fifteen deaths.

7141
04:16:38,630 --> 04:16:39,310
Wowee.

7142
04:16:40,430 --> 04:16:41,110
Wow.

7143
04:16:41,630 --> 04:16:43,590
This is so fun, you guys!

7144
04:16:44,470 --> 04:16:45,230
That was fun!

7145
04:16:45,330 --> 04:16:46,010
Yeah!

7146
04:16:46,350 --> 04:16:47,810
It was so much fun!

7147
04:16:48,090 --> 04:16:53,330
Did you guys see the butler from my POV?

7148
04:16:53,670 --> 04:16:53,690
Did you guys see the butler from my POV?

7149
04:16:54,050 --> 04:16:54,550
I did!

7150
04:16:54,730 --> 04:16:54,950
Yeah!

7151
04:16:55,070 --> 04:16:55,650
Riki!

7152
04:16:55,990 --> 04:16:57,350
You're so ugly.

7153
04:16:58,210 --> 04:17:00,210
He did the stabby stabby.

7154
04:17:00,230 --> 04:17:01,290
Nah, he was ugly.

7155
04:17:01,710 --> 04:17:03,970
Oh my gosh.

7156
04:17:04,710 --> 04:17:05,710
That was so fun.

7157
04:17:06,030 --> 04:17:07,070
Oh yeah.

7158
04:17:07,350 --> 04:17:08,410
We played so much!

7159
04:17:08,570 --> 04:17:09,190
We did!

7160
04:17:09,450 --> 04:17:10,010
For real.

7161
04:17:10,270 --> 04:17:12,630
Oh my gosh, I just realized what time it is.

7162
04:17:12,730 --> 04:17:13,890
Yeah, it's a toy!

7163
04:17:14,130 --> 04:17:16,510
Yeah, we've been playing for four hours.

7164
04:17:17,190 --> 04:17:17,750
Holy...

7165
04:17:18,530 --> 04:17:19,890
Well, thank you.

7166
04:17:21,010 --> 04:17:22,250
I'm really grateful.

7167
04:17:22,250 --> 04:17:23,190
Thank you so much for playing!

7168
04:17:23,630 --> 04:17:24,030
Yeah!

7169
04:17:27,670 --> 04:17:29,530
Get some rest, everybody!

7170
04:17:30,010 --> 04:17:31,790
Yeah, you too, guys!

7171
04:17:32,650 --> 04:17:34,310
You guys want to...

7172
04:17:34,310 --> 04:17:37,470
If there's anything to say before we end, maybe we could take turns.

7173
04:17:38,090 --> 04:17:38,770
Okay.

7174
04:17:39,370 --> 04:17:40,050
Announcements.

7175
04:17:40,750 --> 04:17:41,430
Games.

7176
04:17:42,650 --> 04:17:43,330
Emoji.

7177
04:17:44,430 --> 04:17:45,110
Emoji.

7178
04:17:45,690 --> 04:17:46,370
Yeah.

7179
04:17:48,530 --> 04:17:49,210
Yeah.

7180
04:17:51,490 --> 04:17:51,830
Alright.

7181
04:17:51,830 --> 04:17:54,690
Thank you everyone for playing with me.

7182
04:17:54,690 --> 04:17:58,190
I know I kind of put this collab together last minute.

7183
04:17:58,470 --> 04:18:05,890
But yeah, thank Naki and Aima and Min for all agreeing to play with me today and join in.

7184
04:18:06,110 --> 04:18:11,350
And I'm glad we got to do something big and fun before Naki's hiatus as well.

7185
04:18:12,990 --> 04:18:14,130
Don't mention me!

7186
04:18:14,290 --> 04:18:15,190
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry!

7187
04:18:15,230 --> 04:18:15,890
I'm sorry!

7188
04:18:16,410 --> 04:18:17,070
I'm sorry!

7189
04:18:19,370 --> 04:18:27,890
In terms of upcoming streams for me, I'm playing a rage game called Simple Fish Game.

7190
04:18:28,130 --> 04:18:29,190
I think it's a rage game.

7191
04:18:29,450 --> 04:18:32,090
So if you wanna come see me rage, come watch me tomorrow.

7192
04:18:32,490 --> 04:18:34,810
And also on Sunday, I'm doing a violin stream.

7193
04:18:34,930 --> 04:18:36,530
I'm playing Professor Layton's song.

7194
04:18:36,630 --> 04:18:38,170
If you're a fan of the series, come watch!

7195
04:18:38,330 --> 04:18:38,810
Let's go!

7196
04:18:40,130 --> 04:18:41,010
Thank you!

7197
04:18:42,590 --> 04:18:45,090
And share this up to all the lovely girlies here.

7198
04:18:45,090 --> 04:18:45,630
Yeah!

7199
04:18:52,250 --> 04:18:53,530
Excuse me?

7200
04:18:53,730 --> 04:18:55,150
I'm sorry.

7201
04:18:56,090 --> 04:18:57,830
Yeah, you better apologize.

7202
04:18:59,310 --> 04:18:59,950
Apologize.

7203
04:18:59,950 --> 04:19:00,110
Okay.

7204
04:19:03,190 --> 04:19:03,830
Okay.

7205
04:19:04,350 --> 04:19:04,990
Who?

7206
04:19:09,550 --> 04:19:12,250
I think I like someone.

7207
04:19:13,310 --> 04:19:13,630
Oh, me?

7208
04:19:13,770 --> 04:19:13,990
Okay.

7209
04:19:17,070 --> 04:19:20,190
For me, I only have a stream tomorrow.

7210
04:19:20,570 --> 04:19:23,430
It's gonna be 3D cleaning up my room.

7211
04:19:23,630 --> 04:19:24,330
Nothing special.

7212
04:19:24,430 --> 04:19:24,790
Just me.

7213
04:19:24,890 --> 04:19:26,250
Literally cleaning up my room.

7214
04:19:26,350 --> 04:19:27,110
Nothing special.

7215
04:19:27,430 --> 04:19:28,690
Productive stream.

7216
04:19:29,230 --> 04:19:36,450
Yeah, I don't have anything going on to announce, but yeah, I just wanna say thank you to everybody who joined.

7217
04:19:36,590 --> 04:19:40,790
And thank you to these lovely ladies for playing with me.

7218
04:19:41,030 --> 04:19:41,330
Thank you!

7219
04:19:41,330 --> 04:19:42,550
Thank you!

7220
04:19:45,970 --> 04:19:46,770
Yay!

7221
04:19:46,770 --> 04:19:46,950
Yay!

7222
04:19:47,350 --> 04:19:48,510
Thank you!

7223
04:19:48,890 --> 04:19:49,590
Next.

7224
04:19:53,540 --> 04:19:54,340
Oh.

7225
04:19:56,460 --> 04:19:57,560
The maid?

7226
04:19:57,720 --> 04:19:58,760
Big boss?

7227
04:19:58,780 --> 04:20:00,800
Hold on.

7228
04:20:03,320 --> 04:20:06,560
Thank you guys for collabing with me.

7229
04:20:06,820 --> 04:20:08,020
It was a lot of fun.

7230
04:20:08,460 --> 04:20:18,260
I really enjoyed being able to collab with you again, Emily, and collabing with you, Ayla-sama, and Naki for the first time.

7231
04:20:18,260 --> 04:20:19,180
It was so much fun.

7232
04:20:19,800 --> 04:20:20,240
But...

7233
04:20:21,200 --> 04:20:24,280
I'm glad that we could play before your hiatus, Naki.

7234
04:20:25,280 --> 04:20:25,720
Yeah.

7235
04:20:26,680 --> 04:20:27,120
Yeah!

7236
04:20:28,240 --> 04:20:30,820
Thank you so much for playing with me!

7237
04:20:30,820 --> 04:20:32,020
Big boss, Gritty.

7238
04:20:34,160 --> 04:20:35,780
I'm always down to hang out more.

7239
04:20:36,600 --> 04:20:37,380
Yeah, yeah.

7240
04:20:37,680 --> 04:20:38,820
I can't stop.

7241
04:20:38,900 --> 04:20:39,160
Wait.

7242
04:20:39,260 --> 04:20:40,100
I can't stop.

7243
04:20:40,960 --> 04:20:41,640
Okay, okay.

7244
04:20:41,640 --> 04:20:42,540
Can't stop the Gritty.

7245
04:20:44,700 --> 04:20:45,300
Wait.

7246
04:20:45,460 --> 04:20:47,180
Oh, there we go.

7247
04:20:47,760 --> 04:20:48,800
Thank you!

7248
04:20:49,800 --> 04:20:50,720
Thank you!

7249
04:20:51,280 --> 04:20:51,880
Bye.

7250
04:20:52,400 --> 04:20:54,260
Alright, last but not the least.

7251
04:20:54,540 --> 04:20:54,860
Yeah.

7252
04:20:57,280 --> 04:21:01,180
I just want to say I love you guys so much.

7253
04:21:02,060 --> 04:21:02,660
Aww.

7254
04:21:02,960 --> 04:21:05,580
I'm very happy I get to play with you guys today.

7255
04:21:05,740 --> 04:21:06,940
And I'm happy that...

7256
04:21:07,580 --> 04:21:11,540
I'm happy everyone pushes support Emily.

7257
04:21:14,920 --> 04:21:16,260
That would make me happy.

7258
04:21:16,440 --> 04:21:16,940
Yeah.

7259
04:21:23,600 --> 04:21:24,740
There we go.

7260
04:21:24,860 --> 04:21:26,080
Good luck, Naki!

7261
04:21:26,300 --> 04:21:27,240
Aww, Naki!

7262
04:21:27,860 --> 04:21:29,300
Aww, Naki!

7263
04:21:29,300 --> 04:21:31,940
I will always support you.

7264
04:21:32,000 --> 04:21:33,140
But I got to hang out with you.

7265
04:21:33,260 --> 04:21:33,660
Thank you

7266
04:21:40,500 --> 04:21:43,160
so much for all the fun today.

7267
04:21:43,280 --> 04:21:43,760
Oh my god.

7268
04:21:44,080 --> 04:21:45,640
Yeah, I hope you guys like the mods.

7269
04:21:46,140 --> 04:21:49,100
I had so much fun.

7270
04:21:49,280 --> 04:21:49,720
Me too.

7271
04:21:50,720 --> 04:21:52,820
Definitely made the game less scary.

7272
04:21:53,500 --> 04:21:55,380
Yeah, the game crashed only once before we played.

7273
04:21:55,460 --> 04:21:55,860
Yeah.

7274
04:21:57,100 --> 04:21:57,940
It's all good.

7275
04:21:59,580 --> 04:22:01,240
No Goku, but it's okay.

7276
04:22:01,300 --> 04:22:01,560
I know.

7277
04:22:01,980 --> 04:22:03,540
I don't think it's working.

7278
04:22:03,840 --> 04:22:04,620
I don't think so either.

7279
04:22:04,980 --> 04:22:07,180
At least it didn't crash because of the update.

7280
04:22:08,080 --> 04:22:10,860
Alright, I'll see you guys around.

7281
04:22:11,200 --> 04:22:12,040
See you around.

7282
04:22:13,340 --> 04:22:14,340
Good luck.

7283
04:22:15,100 --> 04:22:15,920
Love you all.

7284
04:22:16,080 --> 04:22:17,580
Stay loyal to the mission, everybody.

7285
04:22:18,960 --> 04:22:20,220
For the company.

7286
04:22:21,140 --> 04:22:22,500
For the company.

7287
04:22:26,340 --> 04:22:27,620
Bye-bye.

7288
04:22:28,360 --> 04:22:29,380
Bye-bye.

7289
04:22:29,920 --> 04:22:30,060
Bye-bye.

7290
04:22:30,140 --> 04:22:30,880
Bye-bye.

7291
04:22:31,400 --> 04:22:32,400
Bye-bye.

7292
04:22:32,780 --> 04:22:33,840
Oh my gosh.

7293
04:22:35,300 --> 04:22:36,780
Where's your phone?

7294
04:22:37,560 --> 04:22:39,020
Touch butt, I guess.

7295
04:22:39,240 --> 04:22:40,480
Yeah, touch butt.

7296
04:22:41,200 --> 04:22:41,940
Let's go.

7297
04:22:43,780 --> 04:22:45,680
I cannot even see it.

7298
04:22:46,220 --> 04:22:46,860
Yeah.

7299
04:22:47,780 --> 04:22:49,360
I can just imagine it.

7300
04:22:49,440 --> 04:22:49,480
It's okay.

7301
04:22:49,500 --> 04:22:49,940
It's not exact.

7302
04:22:51,500 --> 04:22:52,380
Oh my god.

7303
04:22:52,440 --> 04:22:53,260
You guys are really...

7304
04:22:53,260 --> 04:22:55,040
You are really on top of each other.

7305
04:23:00,160 --> 04:23:02,600
I'm gonna go talk to my chat a little bit now.

7306
04:23:02,780 --> 04:23:03,460
Same here.

7307
04:23:03,740 --> 04:23:04,480
Me too.

7308
04:23:05,340 --> 04:23:06,480
Bye-bye everyone.

7309
04:23:06,780 --> 04:23:07,260
Bye-bye.

7310
04:23:13,020 --> 04:23:13,520
Yay.

7311
04:23:18,680 --> 04:23:19,620
Let me...

7312
04:23:21,280 --> 04:23:24,580
Let me change some stuff on my...

7313
04:23:24,580 --> 04:23:25,660
It's just frozen there.

7314
04:23:26,460 --> 04:23:27,620
Let's change some stuff.

7315
04:23:27,740 --> 04:23:28,280
There we go.

7316
04:23:29,080 --> 04:23:29,600
Yeah.

7317
04:23:32,380 --> 04:23:32,900
Yippee.

7318
04:23:34,300 --> 04:23:34,820
Yippee.

7319
04:23:35,040 --> 04:23:35,560
Yippee.

7320
04:23:36,840 --> 04:23:38,080
Welcome back, boys.

7321
04:23:38,240 --> 04:23:39,100
Thank you.

7322
04:23:39,300 --> 04:23:42,020
Oh, my game is not responding anymore.

7323
04:23:44,940 --> 04:23:47,900
My game is not responding.

7324
04:23:48,360 --> 04:23:49,100
That's fine.

7325
04:23:49,420 --> 04:23:52,560
Look, it's a nice little screenshot of the three of us.

7326
04:23:52,560 --> 04:23:54,720
I mean, the four of us.

7327
04:23:54,760 --> 04:23:55,700
I'm not in the picture though.

7328
04:23:58,820 --> 04:23:59,940
Oh, there we go.

7329
04:24:01,980 --> 04:24:03,220
That was so fun.

7330
04:24:03,400 --> 04:24:03,980
Oh my gosh.

7331
04:24:04,460 --> 04:24:06,140
I've never played with the mods before.

7332
04:24:06,240 --> 04:24:07,660
I don't know what mods we had.

7333
04:24:08,760 --> 04:24:09,320
Hold on.

7334
04:24:09,360 --> 04:24:10,000
I think I can check.

7335
04:24:12,200 --> 04:24:14,340
There's so many that it's like...

7336
04:24:14,340 --> 04:24:15,180
Let's see.

7337
04:24:16,940 --> 04:24:18,060
We have more suits.

7338
04:24:18,160 --> 04:24:19,340
More emotes.

7339
04:24:19,340 --> 04:24:19,680
Yippee.

7340
04:24:20,540 --> 04:24:21,540
Flashlight toggle.

7341
04:24:21,980 --> 04:24:22,920
I don't know what's on that.

7342
04:24:23,280 --> 04:24:24,540
Better item scan.

7343
04:24:24,760 --> 04:24:25,560
Better stamina.

7344
04:24:26,920 --> 04:24:27,560
Skinwalkers.

7345
04:24:27,560 --> 04:24:28,520
Push to mute.

7346
04:24:30,880 --> 04:24:32,340
Couple patch things.

7347
04:24:32,660 --> 04:24:33,400
Helmet cameras.

7348
04:24:33,800 --> 04:24:34,440
Walkie use.

7349
04:24:34,800 --> 04:24:36,760
We never use a walkie, so...

7350
04:24:36,760 --> 04:24:37,900
Needy cats.

7351
04:24:38,180 --> 04:24:39,400
Hey, it's me, Goku.

7352
04:24:39,700 --> 04:24:40,700
It doesn't work.

7353
04:24:41,460 --> 04:24:42,400
So sad.

7354
04:24:42,700 --> 04:24:43,700
Metal Gear sneaking theme.

7355
04:24:44,200 --> 04:24:45,240
Lethal clunk.

7356
04:24:45,280 --> 04:24:46,240
Which was the pipes.

7357
04:24:48,820 --> 04:24:49,660
Lethal press.

7358
04:24:49,680 --> 04:24:50,880
Presence, which was the present.

7359
04:24:51,060 --> 04:24:51,960
What's more screams?

7360
04:24:53,960 --> 04:24:57,780
Modification allows you to hear players' voice for two seconds after they die.

7361
04:24:58,280 --> 04:24:58,840
Ohhhh.

7362
04:25:00,620 --> 04:25:01,180
Cool.

7363
04:25:02,740 --> 04:25:08,040
Yeah, it says adds the hey it's me Goku audio to the bracken whenever it hunts you.

7364
04:25:08,820 --> 04:25:09,380
Dang.

7365
04:25:11,700 --> 04:25:13,080
And he was hunting me.

7366
04:25:13,140 --> 04:25:13,440
He was.

7367
04:25:14,580 --> 04:25:19,200
Lethal plushies is the one that adds the free run plush and stuff.

7368
04:25:19,840 --> 04:25:21,280
And big boss suit.

7369
04:25:24,260 --> 04:25:27,220
A lot of this was Emuri too.

7370
04:25:27,320 --> 04:25:30,020
She found all the mods basically.

7371
04:25:30,580 --> 04:25:36,680
Well, my friend gave me some mods and then we kind of added more to it.

7372
04:25:36,880 --> 04:25:41,600
But Emuri tested everything and made sure it was not gonna crash.

7373
04:25:42,160 --> 04:25:45,000
Unfortunately, the Minecraft one didn't work.

7374
04:25:45,100 --> 04:25:47,220
It was gonna add a Minecraft map.

7375
04:25:47,220 --> 04:25:49,880
But if only we had played right before.

7376
04:25:49,940 --> 04:25:51,460
If only we had played before the update.

7377
04:25:51,760 --> 04:25:52,480
But that's okay.

7378
04:25:53,900 --> 04:25:55,140
The big boss suit.

7379
04:25:55,220 --> 04:25:56,880
Yeah, that's what I was wearing the whole time.

7380
04:25:57,020 --> 04:25:57,720
But you couldn't see.

7381
04:25:58,200 --> 04:26:01,500
I should have asked someone to put it on so I could see what it looked like.

7382
04:26:01,680 --> 04:26:05,680
Okay, I'm gonna have to go see their VOD so I can see what it looked like.

7383
04:26:07,460 --> 04:26:08,540
That was so much fun.

7384
04:26:09,840 --> 04:26:10,220
Man.

7385
04:26:11,920 --> 04:26:14,660
Glad that I could play with everyone.

7386
04:26:17,300 --> 04:26:18,180
So, yeah.

7387
04:26:18,360 --> 04:26:20,320
Thank you again Emuri for setting this up.

7388
04:26:20,460 --> 04:26:22,780
And I'm glad that I could play with Naki before her hiatus.

7389
04:26:22,960 --> 04:26:24,680
And play with Ayla-sama.

7390
04:26:25,540 --> 04:26:25,980
Yeah.

7391
04:26:27,760 --> 04:26:29,080
I'll catch the VODs too.

7392
04:26:29,200 --> 04:26:29,460
Yeah.

7393
04:26:29,980 --> 04:26:31,340
Everybody's super duper awesome.

7394
04:26:31,720 --> 04:26:32,940
They're all my friends.

7395
04:26:33,800 --> 04:26:34,240
So.

7396
04:26:35,560 --> 04:26:36,360
Really happy.

7397
04:26:37,580 --> 04:26:40,620
I got to hang out with Emuri a couple times in Japan.

7398
04:26:40,900 --> 04:26:42,040
So, yeah.

7399
04:26:43,160 --> 04:26:50,100
I'm glad that even after all this time we've been able to, you know, hang out and be friends and do everything.

7400
04:26:51,520 --> 04:26:51,960
Friends.

7401
04:26:53,620 --> 04:26:54,040
Yeah.

7402
04:26:54,100 --> 04:26:54,860
We're friends.

7403
04:26:55,120 --> 04:26:55,720
We're friends.

7404
04:26:57,440 --> 04:26:58,620
It was a lot of fun.

7405
04:26:58,720 --> 04:26:58,840
Yeah.

7406
04:26:58,900 --> 04:26:59,600
I hope you guys had fun.

7407
04:26:59,660 --> 04:27:00,800
There were some really funny moments.

7408
04:27:00,960 --> 04:27:02,620
I cannot believe that.

7409
04:27:02,960 --> 04:27:04,100
That mimic round.

7410
04:27:04,960 --> 04:27:06,580
I thought it was one of that.

7411
04:27:06,660 --> 04:27:09,060
You know why I thought it was one of them following too?

7412
04:27:09,900 --> 04:27:10,340
Because...

7413
04:27:10,860 --> 04:27:12,240
Because none of them crouch.

7414
04:27:14,520 --> 04:27:17,860
None of them crouch when they're walking outside sometimes.

7415
04:27:18,360 --> 04:27:19,520
So it's just like...

7416
04:27:19,520 --> 04:27:20,780
So I was just like, oh.

7417
04:27:20,960 --> 04:27:22,560
And then it also had Emuri's voice.

7418
04:27:22,700 --> 04:27:26,040
So I was just like, oh, she's just being quiet because she's trying to, you know, avoid the dogs.

7419
04:27:26,220 --> 04:27:27,520
But she said like, hey.

7420
04:27:27,620 --> 04:27:28,860
Like, you know, she said something.

7421
04:27:28,980 --> 04:27:29,960
So I was like, oh, it's just Emuri.

7422
04:27:30,360 --> 04:27:31,580
That was so crazy.

7423
04:27:33,040 --> 04:27:35,040
And the shadow was cast on her.

7424
04:27:35,100 --> 04:27:37,740
So I would have never seen the...

7425
04:27:39,040 --> 04:27:39,760
the face.

7426
04:27:40,040 --> 04:27:40,880
I never saw the face.

7427
04:27:41,520 --> 04:27:42,740
That was so...

7428
04:27:42,740 --> 04:27:43,480
It was creepy.

7429
04:27:44,000 --> 04:27:46,960
I think that was the creepiest moment I've ever had with the Mimic.

7430
04:27:48,320 --> 04:27:50,380
Skinwalker mod really pulled through in that moment.

7431
04:27:50,500 --> 04:27:51,220
I know!

7432
04:27:52,660 --> 04:27:53,780
Oh my gosh!

7433
04:27:54,940 --> 04:27:57,140
You are actually super cracked at this game.

7434
04:27:58,040 --> 04:27:58,800
Stop it.

7435
04:28:00,460 --> 04:28:01,300
No, I'm not.

7436
04:28:02,020 --> 04:28:02,700
Stop it.

7437
04:28:03,420 --> 04:28:05,120
I hope Oliver is doing okay.

7438
04:28:05,200 --> 04:28:06,320
We looked for Oliver.

7439
04:28:06,760 --> 04:28:07,800
We really did.

7440
04:28:08,380 --> 04:28:09,840
I wonder where that guy went.

7441
04:28:10,200 --> 04:28:11,200
I hope he's okay.

7442
04:28:11,320 --> 04:28:11,700
Oliver.

7443
04:28:12,300 --> 04:28:17,600
Thank you guys for all the donos and super chats and everything while I was playing.

7444
04:28:17,680 --> 04:28:20,920
Sorry that I couldn't re-chat so much because you know, with a collab.

7445
04:28:21,060 --> 04:28:22,380
Especially like this kind of game.

7446
04:28:22,600 --> 04:28:23,620
It's hard to do.

7447
04:28:24,840 --> 04:28:25,800
But, um...

7448
04:28:25,800 --> 04:28:27,700
Hopefully you guys didn't feel too neglected.

7449
04:28:31,180 --> 04:28:32,700
But yeah, it was so much fun!

7450
04:28:32,900 --> 04:28:33,700
Oh my gosh!

7451
04:28:33,940 --> 04:28:34,940
Thank you for the stream.

7452
04:28:35,240 --> 04:28:36,300
Then Kiki moved out.

7453
04:28:38,020 --> 04:28:40,140
No, we abandoned Kiki.

7454
04:28:41,700 --> 04:28:42,700
It's not like we miss you or anything.

7455
04:28:42,840 --> 04:28:43,420
Shut up!

7456
04:28:43,960 --> 04:28:45,460
You shut up!

7457
04:28:46,560 --> 04:28:47,800
Streamer didn't read message.

7458
04:28:47,900 --> 04:28:48,460
It's over.

7459
04:28:49,280 --> 04:28:50,300
It's over.

7460
04:28:51,020 --> 04:28:51,740
It's over.

7461
04:28:52,100 --> 04:28:54,180
But it's 2.30 AM for me.

7462
04:28:54,340 --> 04:28:56,620
And tomorrow I have a long stream.

7463
04:28:56,900 --> 04:29:00,860
So I didn't expect to be playing for four and a half hours.

7464
04:29:02,160 --> 04:29:02,680
Um...

7465
04:29:02,680 --> 04:29:05,200
But we were just having so much fun.

7466
04:29:05,340 --> 04:29:05,700
Yeah!

7467
04:29:06,180 --> 04:29:07,620
I'm from Aylaz.

7468
04:29:07,620 --> 04:29:08,640
Thank you for the very fun collab.

7469
04:29:08,780 --> 04:29:09,700
Oh, thank you!

7470
04:29:09,840 --> 04:29:10,860
Thanks for dropping by!

7471
04:29:11,700 --> 04:29:11,980
I appreciate it!

7472
04:29:13,440 --> 04:29:14,300
So much fun!

7473
04:29:14,500 --> 04:29:15,180
Thank you, thank you!

7474
04:29:17,020 --> 04:29:17,460
Um...

7475
04:29:17,460 --> 04:29:18,580
But yeah...

7476
04:29:18,580 --> 04:29:20,240
What was I gonna say?

7477
04:29:20,400 --> 04:29:22,000
Tomorrow will be...

7478
04:29:23,580 --> 04:29:24,460
Twin Snakes.

7479
04:29:24,500 --> 04:29:25,620
I already have the waiting room up.

7480
04:29:25,840 --> 04:29:27,880
Because I had to move the times around.

7481
04:29:28,800 --> 04:29:29,240
Um...

7482
04:29:29,720 --> 04:29:30,660
A little bit.

7483
04:29:31,020 --> 04:29:33,160
But I have a long stream.

7484
04:29:34,180 --> 04:29:34,620
Tomorrow!

7485
04:29:35,060 --> 04:29:37,220
So I should get some rest tonight.

7486
04:29:37,220 --> 04:29:37,560
Good night!

7487
04:29:38,980 --> 04:29:40,220
Thanks for the gift!

7488
04:29:41,040 --> 04:29:42,980
For the super chat!

7489
04:29:43,360 --> 04:29:43,980
Oh, sorry.

7490
04:29:44,220 --> 04:29:45,140
I won't read this.

7491
04:29:45,480 --> 04:29:46,520
It was really fun watching you guys.

7492
04:29:46,580 --> 04:29:48,940
I put you on the background while I was making pickled eggs.

7493
04:29:49,180 --> 04:29:50,320
It was hard not laughing.

7494
04:29:50,460 --> 04:29:50,900
Good night!

7495
04:29:50,900 --> 04:29:51,580
Thanks for the stream!

7496
04:29:52,020 --> 04:29:53,080
Thank you!

7497
04:29:54,240 --> 04:29:56,220
Are you gonna finish Twin Snakes next stream?

7498
04:29:56,580 --> 04:29:57,640
I don't know.

7499
04:29:59,340 --> 04:29:59,980
We'll see.

7500
04:30:00,220 --> 04:30:03,220
I might go crazy and try and finish it.

7501
04:30:04,160 --> 04:30:06,200
I might go crazy and try and finish it.

7502
04:30:06,340 --> 04:30:06,920
We'll see.

7503
04:30:07,680 --> 04:30:09,000
I still... I'm what?

7504
04:30:09,140 --> 04:30:09,620
Like...

7505
04:30:12,560 --> 04:30:13,700
I'm not halfway.

7506
04:30:16,220 --> 04:30:16,780
I'm not halfway.

7507
04:30:16,780 --> 04:30:17,140
Am I halfway?

7508
04:30:20,810 --> 04:30:22,970
The briefings did take a good chunk of time.

7509
04:30:23,150 --> 04:30:23,530
The briefings did take a good chunk of time.

7510
04:30:23,530 --> 04:30:24,810
It always takes 40 minutes.

7511
04:30:25,590 --> 04:30:26,670
I'm past half?

7512
04:30:26,770 --> 04:30:27,030
For real?

7513
04:30:28,610 --> 04:30:32,170
I'm past half?

7514
04:30:32,170 --> 04:30:32,170
For real?

7515
04:30:32,170 --> 04:30:33,710
I always think of...

7516
04:30:33,710 --> 04:30:37,070
It's funny because I always think of the switching of the CDs as halfway.

7517
04:30:37,810 --> 04:30:39,990
Yeah, disc 2 has halfway.

7518
04:30:40,130 --> 04:30:41,310
But it's actually not really.

7519
04:30:42,090 --> 04:30:44,230
I almost always miss my chance to catch these live.

7520
04:30:44,270 --> 04:30:45,150
But today was the day!

7521
04:30:45,430 --> 04:30:46,310
JL thank you!

7522
04:30:46,530 --> 04:30:47,630
Congrats for your awesome game.

7523
04:30:47,810 --> 04:30:49,050
Thank you so much!

7524
04:30:49,930 --> 04:30:50,650
Meryl Silverberg!

7525
04:30:51,110 --> 04:30:52,850
Thank you for the fun Lethal Company collab.

7526
04:30:53,090 --> 04:30:53,890
A lot of funny moments.

7527
04:30:53,950 --> 04:30:55,430
Looking forward to your next Metal Gear Solid stream.

7528
04:30:55,670 --> 04:30:56,290
Can I really wait?

7529
04:30:56,410 --> 04:30:57,570
I've been thinking about...

7530
04:30:57,570 --> 04:30:58,090
Oh my gosh.

7531
04:30:58,110 --> 04:30:59,150
I've been thinking about...

7532
04:31:00,950 --> 04:31:01,310
About...

7533
04:31:04,550 --> 04:31:05,750
About Twin Snakes.

7534
04:31:05,850 --> 04:31:06,790
Like all week.

7535
04:31:06,850 --> 04:31:08,230
I was just like maybe I should move it sooner.

7536
04:31:08,230 --> 04:31:09,370
Maybe I should move it sooner.

7537
04:31:09,590 --> 04:31:11,850
Every time I play Metal Gear, I just wanna play...

7538
04:31:11,850 --> 04:31:13,070
I just wanna...

7539
04:31:13,070 --> 04:31:15,530
I just always can't wait for the next time I play it again.

7540
04:31:17,610 --> 04:31:19,550
Does Twin Snakes also have the disc switch?

7541
04:31:19,670 --> 04:31:20,050
It does!

7542
04:31:20,310 --> 04:31:21,010
Yeah, it does.

7543
04:31:23,730 --> 04:31:24,530
I have...

7544
04:31:27,010 --> 04:31:28,130
You can hear it.

7545
04:31:28,170 --> 04:31:29,030
I have disc 2...

7546
04:31:30,230 --> 04:31:31,010
Right here.

7547
04:31:33,650 --> 04:31:35,530
Disc 1 is obviously in...

7548
04:31:36,670 --> 04:31:38,710
In my GameCube at the moment.

7549
04:31:42,890 --> 04:31:43,850
In my GameCube at the moment.

7550
04:31:43,850 --> 04:31:45,650
I was thinking about April 30th.

7551
04:31:46,790 --> 04:31:49,270
I think I have another plan for April 30th.

7552
04:31:49,290 --> 04:31:49,370
I think I have another plan for April 30th.

7553
04:31:49,370 --> 04:31:50,390
What I kinda wanna do.

7554
04:31:51,430 --> 04:31:52,950
Instead of just playing.

7555
04:31:53,010 --> 04:31:54,910
Because I was thinking of like starting...

7556
04:31:54,910 --> 04:31:58,470
Or like doing kind of marathoning Metal Gear Solid 2.

7557
04:31:58,670 --> 04:31:58,750
Or like doing kind of marathoning Metal Gear Solid 2.

7558
04:32:00,210 --> 04:32:02,230
And finishing on April 30th.

7559
04:32:02,270 --> 04:32:05,510
But I do have another plan of something I kinda wanna do.

7560
04:32:06,390 --> 04:32:07,930
Involving April 30th.

7561
04:32:09,170 --> 04:32:10,270
Metal Gear related.

7562
04:32:10,850 --> 04:32:13,330
And once...

7563
04:32:13,330 --> 04:32:15,990
I do plan on replaying...

7564
04:32:19,270 --> 04:32:19,610
All...

7565
04:32:19,610 --> 04:32:21,910
Most if not all the games.

7566
04:32:22,250 --> 04:32:24,290
So at least like...

7567
04:32:24,290 --> 04:32:27,450
You can definitely expect me to play...

7568
04:32:29,510 --> 04:32:30,870
MGS1 through...

7569
04:32:31,390 --> 04:32:32,830
Peace Walker at least.

7570
04:32:34,410 --> 04:32:35,090
Um...

7571
04:32:35,770 --> 04:32:36,290
Because...

7572
04:32:36,290 --> 04:32:37,910
I have some plans.

7573
04:32:40,250 --> 04:32:40,770
So...

7574
04:32:43,170 --> 04:32:45,730
But I do plan on playing them.

7575
04:32:45,890 --> 04:32:46,670
And streaming them.

7576
04:32:48,010 --> 04:32:48,530
So...

7577
04:32:48,530 --> 04:32:49,430
Yes.

7578
04:32:49,630 --> 04:32:50,930
5 is a long one to replay.

7579
04:32:51,250 --> 04:32:53,270
That's the only one I'm...

7580
04:32:53,910 --> 04:32:54,430
Debating.

7581
04:32:54,890 --> 04:32:57,410
But at the same time I might get to the end.

7582
04:32:57,530 --> 04:32:58,830
And I might be like...

7583
04:32:59,310 --> 04:33:00,590
Man I gotta play it.

7584
04:33:03,050 --> 04:33:03,490
So...

7585
04:33:03,490 --> 04:33:04,790
I usually miss your streams.

7586
04:33:04,830 --> 04:33:06,250
But your current schedule actually got me...

7587
04:33:06,250 --> 04:33:07,150
Finally catching your streams.

7588
04:33:07,270 --> 04:33:07,490
Oh my god.

7589
04:33:07,530 --> 04:33:08,310
Strike Warlock.

7590
04:33:08,330 --> 04:33:08,990
Thank you.

7591
04:33:09,270 --> 04:33:10,190
Thank you so much.

7592
04:33:10,290 --> 04:33:10,530
Thank you.

7593
04:33:10,590 --> 04:33:10,770
Thank you.

7594
04:33:11,090 --> 04:33:13,250
Will you be playing all of the Metal Gear games?

7595
04:33:13,370 --> 04:33:15,510
So we can experience the brain rot a second...

7596
04:33:16,610 --> 04:33:17,490
First time?

7597
04:33:18,230 --> 04:33:18,990
Of course.

7598
04:33:21,550 --> 04:33:22,630
So Revengeance again?

7599
04:33:22,990 --> 04:33:24,430
Revengeance will be...

7600
04:33:25,130 --> 04:33:26,070
At the end.

7601
04:33:27,170 --> 04:33:28,970
I'll actually play it in order.

7602
04:33:28,970 --> 04:33:30,070
Not that I...

7603
04:33:30,070 --> 04:33:30,510
Well I mean...

7604
04:33:30,510 --> 04:33:36,810
I mean when I first played them I kind of played...

7605
04:33:36,810 --> 04:33:37,230
You know...

7606
04:33:37,730 --> 04:33:38,670
I played it...

7607
04:33:38,670 --> 04:33:41,710
Well you know...

7608
04:33:43,150 --> 04:33:43,590
Stop!

7609
04:33:44,230 --> 04:33:44,670
Stop!

7610
04:33:46,910 --> 04:33:47,790
You guys suck.

7611
04:33:50,970 --> 04:33:51,710
Great stream.

7612
04:33:51,750 --> 04:33:52,710
Trying to catch more live.

7613
04:33:52,830 --> 04:33:53,970
But the VODs help me get through work.

7614
04:33:54,110 --> 04:33:56,050
No I appreciate you watching the VODs.

7615
04:33:56,790 --> 04:33:57,650
So so much.

7616
04:33:57,690 --> 04:33:58,510
Thank you so much.

7617
04:33:58,970 --> 04:33:59,390
True wife.

7618
04:34:00,210 --> 04:34:02,130
Especially looking forward to the MGS stream.

7619
04:34:02,290 --> 04:34:02,810
Thank you.

7620
04:34:03,770 --> 04:34:04,430
Thank you.

7621
04:34:04,450 --> 04:34:04,690
Thank you.

7622
04:34:04,690 --> 04:34:05,030
Thank you.

7623
04:34:05,050 --> 04:34:06,250
You made us like this?

7624
04:34:06,410 --> 04:34:07,450
I didn't do anything.

7625
04:34:08,730 --> 04:34:09,990
Played it in heaven right?

7626
04:34:10,270 --> 04:34:10,790
Yeah.

7627
04:34:12,770 --> 04:34:13,290
Yeah.

7628
04:34:13,310 --> 04:34:14,990
In heaven.

7629
04:34:15,210 --> 04:34:16,490
Release order or chronologically?

7630
04:34:16,830 --> 04:34:19,050
I did think about playing it chronologically.

7631
04:34:19,350 --> 04:34:20,890
But I don't think I...

7632
04:34:20,890 --> 04:34:22,030
I don't know.

7633
04:34:22,090 --> 04:34:22,910
I really...

7634
04:34:23,930 --> 04:34:25,890
Feel like playing it...

7635
04:34:25,890 --> 04:34:27,890
In release order...

7636
04:34:28,970 --> 04:34:29,250
You know...

7637
04:34:30,310 --> 04:34:31,270
The bestest.

7638
04:34:32,130 --> 04:34:34,370
Even though I've already played it in release order and everything.

7639
04:34:34,770 --> 04:34:35,770
PhD killers!

7640
04:34:36,070 --> 04:34:37,110
Welcome back!

7641
04:34:37,270 --> 04:34:38,270
Oh my gosh 5 months!

7642
04:34:39,370 --> 04:34:40,490
Wait it kept the...

7643
04:34:40,490 --> 04:34:41,850
It kept the initial...

7644
04:34:42,390 --> 04:34:43,210
Stuff too?

7645
04:34:43,450 --> 04:34:44,870
Thanks for the chaotic collab boss.

7646
04:34:45,090 --> 04:34:45,530
Thank you!

7647
04:34:47,630 --> 04:34:48,730
That's so awesome.

7648
04:34:50,530 --> 04:34:52,210
This is such a fun stream to watch.

7649
04:34:52,350 --> 04:34:53,570
Thanks to you and the others.

7650
04:34:53,590 --> 04:34:54,390
So happy you're here.

7651
04:34:54,510 --> 04:34:55,030
Thank you Shy!

7652
04:34:55,270 --> 04:34:55,890
Thank you!

7653
04:34:57,590 --> 04:34:58,070
Yeah.

7654
04:34:58,970 --> 04:35:01,010
MGS3 hits harder if you play it in release order.

7655
04:35:01,770 --> 04:35:02,210
Agreed.

7656
04:35:02,250 --> 04:35:04,290
You know guys, I've been thinking a lot about it.

7657
04:35:05,250 --> 04:35:06,130
Avoid MGS5.

7658
04:35:06,230 --> 04:35:06,970
I have issues.

7659
04:35:10,130 --> 04:35:11,010
Really Huey?

7660
04:35:11,490 --> 04:35:12,710
You have issues?

7661
04:35:13,790 --> 04:35:14,230
Really?

7662
04:35:14,530 --> 04:35:15,230
Oh my gosh!

7663
04:35:15,330 --> 04:35:15,830
We die!

7664
04:35:16,170 --> 04:35:17,330
Thanks for the hot dog.

7665
04:35:20,250 --> 04:35:21,470
What was I gonna say?

7666
04:35:21,570 --> 04:35:21,950
Oh...

7667
04:35:22,450 --> 04:35:24,390
I've been thinking so much...

7668
04:35:25,790 --> 04:35:26,230
About...

7669
04:35:26,230 --> 04:35:27,050
I don't know.

7670
04:35:27,170 --> 04:35:27,690
Recently...

7671
04:35:27,690 --> 04:35:29,350
I think it's because I was like...

7672
04:35:29,350 --> 04:35:30,930
April 30th is coming up.

7673
04:35:31,270 --> 04:35:33,870
For a long time I was like...

7674
04:35:33,870 --> 04:35:35,530
MGS3 is my favorite Metal Gear.

7675
04:35:35,770 --> 04:35:37,750
MGS3 is my favorite one.

7676
04:35:37,970 --> 04:35:38,490
MGS3!

7677
04:35:38,810 --> 04:35:41,710
I just love everything about MGS3.

7678
04:35:42,090 --> 04:35:43,150
But now...

7679
04:35:45,310 --> 04:35:45,830
I...

7680
04:35:45,830 --> 04:35:47,450
I think I've changed my mind.

7681
04:35:47,690 --> 04:35:50,590
And I think I've changed my mind for like...

7682
04:35:50,590 --> 04:35:51,890
For good.

7683
04:35:52,150 --> 04:35:53,970
Because I always would kind of be like...

7684
04:35:53,970 --> 04:35:55,090
3 is so awesome.

7685
04:35:55,290 --> 04:35:56,030
3 is my favorite.

7686
04:35:56,270 --> 04:35:57,290
But I really love 2.

7687
04:35:57,390 --> 04:35:57,790
It's like...

7688
04:35:57,790 --> 04:35:58,790
Neck and neck, you know?

7689
04:35:59,770 --> 04:36:01,750
But now I think, honestly...

7690
04:36:01,750 --> 04:36:03,690
2 is my favorite.

7691
04:36:05,310 --> 04:36:06,930
I think 2 is my favorite.

7692
04:36:07,450 --> 04:36:09,290
And then second is Peace Walker.

7693
04:36:10,410 --> 04:36:11,830
And then 3!

7694
04:36:12,170 --> 04:36:13,290
Isn't that so crazy?

7695
04:36:13,950 --> 04:36:15,310
2 is just special.

7696
04:36:15,590 --> 04:36:16,870
I think there's like...

7697
04:36:16,870 --> 04:36:19,050
A weird sense of nostalgia that I feel.

7698
04:36:19,450 --> 04:36:20,250
With 2.

7699
04:36:20,410 --> 04:36:22,230
Even though I never played it as a kid.

7700
04:36:22,490 --> 04:36:23,370
With 2.

7701
04:36:23,370 --> 04:36:23,370
Even though I never played it as a kid.

7702
04:36:23,970 --> 04:36:24,130
Like...

7703
04:36:24,690 --> 04:36:26,050
The ending of...

7704
04:36:27,610 --> 04:36:29,030
MGS3 obviously hits.

7705
04:36:29,310 --> 04:36:31,930
But there's something about the ending of MGS2...

7706
04:36:31,930 --> 04:36:32,830
That hits even harder.

7707
04:36:33,190 --> 04:36:33,930
I don't know.

7708
04:36:34,850 --> 04:36:36,390
Okay, so Plissken on side B.

7709
04:36:38,110 --> 04:36:39,150
You're... Oh my gosh.

7710
04:36:39,230 --> 04:36:40,530
First of all, you are so fast.

7711
04:36:40,710 --> 04:36:42,190
Second of all, I didn't think you were...

7712
04:36:42,190 --> 04:36:43,150
I was not serious.

7713
04:36:43,330 --> 04:36:45,150
I didn't think this would actually happen.

7714
04:36:45,390 --> 04:36:46,530
If it's actually happening.

7715
04:36:46,730 --> 04:36:47,150
And 3!

7716
04:36:47,450 --> 04:36:48,270
Oh my gosh!

7717
04:36:48,590 --> 04:36:49,730
He looks so good.

7718
04:36:51,530 --> 04:36:52,410
You're incredible.

7719
04:36:52,750 --> 04:36:53,190
You're amazing.

7720
04:36:55,510 --> 04:36:58,510
The handshake and the moment that hits me the hardest in the series ever.

7721
04:36:58,990 --> 04:36:59,430
No!

7722
04:37:00,810 --> 04:37:01,250
Man.

7723
04:37:02,830 --> 04:37:04,270
I love MGS.

7724
04:37:04,510 --> 04:37:06,130
I just... MGS2.

7725
04:37:06,290 --> 04:37:07,010
I love it.

7726
04:37:07,050 --> 04:37:08,010
I love Metal Gear Solid.

7727
04:37:08,210 --> 04:37:09,810
I love Metal Gear Solid 2.

7728
04:37:10,270 --> 04:37:12,190
Ending is so insane that it's more memorable.

7729
04:37:12,410 --> 04:37:12,930
I think so.

7730
04:37:13,050 --> 04:37:14,630
I think also because like...

7731
04:37:14,630 --> 04:37:15,630
Obviously I was like...

7732
04:37:15,630 --> 04:37:16,010
Oh my gosh.

7733
04:37:16,030 --> 04:37:17,270
Kind of brain rotted from...

7734
04:37:17,970 --> 04:37:19,290
From Metal Gear Solid.

7735
04:37:20,830 --> 04:37:21,270
But...

7736
04:37:22,250 --> 04:37:23,950
Like... Metal Gear Solid 2...

7737
04:37:23,970 --> 04:37:24,890
Made me be like...

7738
04:37:25,710 --> 04:37:28,230
I was hook, line, sinker.

7739
04:37:28,350 --> 04:37:29,390
I was in deep.

7740
04:37:29,470 --> 04:37:30,370
I was not coming out.

7741
04:37:30,450 --> 04:37:31,590
I dug my grave.

7742
04:37:31,770 --> 04:37:32,370
I dug it.

7743
04:37:32,390 --> 04:37:35,330
I dug it six feet under.

7744
04:37:35,450 --> 04:37:36,990
I was already...

7745
04:37:36,990 --> 04:37:38,670
I could not climb out of that.

7746
04:37:38,850 --> 04:37:40,210
Even if I tried.

7747
04:37:40,470 --> 04:37:42,970
I was the big hook.

7748
04:37:43,910 --> 04:37:45,450
Mint loves MGS.

7749
04:37:45,810 --> 04:37:46,290
Shocked.

7750
04:37:47,510 --> 04:37:48,290
Adam Bomb.

7751
04:37:48,410 --> 04:37:49,150
Welcome to membership.

7752
04:37:49,390 --> 04:37:50,070
Thank you so much.

7753
04:37:50,790 --> 04:37:52,330
I need to explain to me.

7754
04:37:52,390 --> 04:37:53,030
It was so wild.

7755
04:37:53,250 --> 04:37:55,330
We can talk about it next time I play it.

7756
04:38:03,570 --> 04:38:05,630
My brain rot is never going away.

7757
04:38:05,890 --> 04:38:08,350
I got some more Metal Gear goods in today.

7758
04:38:12,550 --> 04:38:14,270
Which one of them was...

7759
04:38:14,270 --> 04:38:16,110
You know I never actually had the...

7760
04:38:16,110 --> 04:38:17,610
Soundtrack for...

7761
04:38:18,430 --> 04:38:19,870
For Metal Gear Solid 2.

7762
04:38:20,070 --> 04:38:21,090
Like I have...

7763
04:38:21,090 --> 04:38:22,750
I have like a bunch of CDs.

7764
04:38:22,890 --> 04:38:25,050
And some of them contain like music from the games.

7765
04:38:25,150 --> 04:38:25,470
But...

7766
04:38:26,010 --> 04:38:29,150
I don't have like dedicated CDs for each game.

7767
04:38:29,310 --> 04:38:30,050
Except two.

7768
04:38:30,170 --> 04:38:32,530
I finally could find that one.

7769
04:38:32,750 --> 04:38:34,630
But I need to find like a CD.

7770
04:38:34,870 --> 04:38:37,370
Like the ones I have of three are like...

7771
04:38:37,370 --> 04:38:40,330
Oh this is different variations of Snake Eater.

7772
04:38:43,970 --> 04:38:44,450
But...

7773
04:38:45,650 --> 04:38:48,570
I want like the actual game music soundtrack.

7774
04:38:48,630 --> 04:38:49,070
You know?

7775
04:38:50,870 --> 04:38:52,310
In terms of gameplay...

7776
04:38:52,310 --> 04:38:53,670
I think Five is my fave.

7777
04:38:53,670 --> 04:38:54,490
Or my fave is Five.

7778
04:38:54,670 --> 04:38:55,350
But I love them all.

7779
04:38:55,570 --> 04:38:56,030
Oh yeah.

7780
04:38:56,230 --> 04:38:58,250
The gameplay in Five is phenomenal.

7781
04:38:59,550 --> 04:38:59,990
Phenomenal.

7782
04:39:00,090 --> 04:39:01,070
It's so fun.

7783
04:39:01,250 --> 04:39:02,150
It's so awesome.

7784
04:39:04,150 --> 04:39:07,710
I think so for me too.

7785
04:39:09,650 --> 04:39:12,190
I think MGS2 has the most memorable memes for me.

7786
04:39:12,230 --> 04:39:13,670
But MGS3 is my favorite story.

7787
04:39:14,170 --> 04:39:14,810
I can...

7788
04:39:14,810 --> 04:39:15,570
I can get with that.

7789
04:39:16,090 --> 04:39:17,590
But even for Two...

7790
04:39:19,290 --> 04:39:21,390
Like Three I love quoting so much.

7791
04:39:21,450 --> 04:39:21,990
I'm always like...

7792
04:39:21,990 --> 04:39:22,590
I want some more.

7793
04:39:22,870 --> 04:39:23,150
You know?

7794
04:39:24,090 --> 04:39:25,150
I don't know.

7795
04:39:25,610 --> 04:39:27,590
Two is just...

7796
04:39:27,590 --> 04:39:29,370
It's just something about it.

7797
04:39:29,470 --> 04:39:32,270
Like I said it makes me feel nostalgic in a way that...

7798
04:39:32,270 --> 04:39:34,350
I shouldn't feel nostalgic for.

7799
04:39:34,470 --> 04:39:35,610
But I do.

7800
04:39:37,130 --> 04:39:37,870
I don't know.

7801
04:39:39,130 --> 04:39:41,670
I also really like stories that take place...

7802
04:39:42,450 --> 04:39:43,370
At the ocean.

7803
04:39:44,750 --> 04:39:45,230
Like...

7804
04:39:45,570 --> 04:39:48,530
I love the beach.

7805
04:39:48,710 --> 04:39:49,470
So much.

7806
04:39:49,930 --> 04:39:51,090
I love the ocean.

7807
04:39:51,310 --> 04:39:54,330
One scene that really sticks out to me...

7808
04:39:55,110 --> 04:39:55,710
Is...

7809
04:39:55,710 --> 04:39:57,290
Is when...

7810
04:39:57,290 --> 04:39:59,690
Emma and Raiden are...

7811
04:39:59,690 --> 04:40:00,750
When she's about to...

7812
04:40:00,750 --> 04:40:02,870
When she's about to...

7813
04:40:03,290 --> 04:40:04,850
Get attacked by Vamp.

7814
04:40:05,050 --> 04:40:07,050
When they're climbing down the...

7815
04:40:07,850 --> 04:40:08,670
The ladder.

7816
04:40:09,010 --> 04:40:11,230
And then they walk outside.

7817
04:40:11,470 --> 04:40:12,630
And it's just the sunset.

7818
04:40:12,790 --> 04:40:13,950
And they're just looking over the water.

7819
04:40:16,630 --> 04:40:17,150
So...

7820
04:40:17,150 --> 04:40:17,870
So...

7821
04:40:17,870 --> 04:40:19,330
Visually beautiful.

7822
04:40:20,050 --> 04:40:20,950
And orange.

7823
04:40:26,060 --> 04:40:28,000
We've managed to avoid drowning.

7824
04:40:28,360 --> 04:40:29,560
The ocean is so comfy.

7825
04:40:29,760 --> 04:40:30,540
It is.

7826
04:40:30,760 --> 04:40:31,800
I don't have...

7827
04:40:31,800 --> 04:40:35,080
I know some people have that fear of the deep ocean.

7828
04:40:35,420 --> 04:40:35,920
But...

7829
04:40:37,300 --> 04:40:38,220
Who is Vamp?

7830
04:40:38,420 --> 04:40:39,740
Is this Vamp because he's a vampire?

7831
04:40:40,260 --> 04:40:41,000
Oh my gosh.

7832
04:40:41,000 --> 04:40:41,800
Next time I play...

7833
04:40:41,800 --> 04:40:43,140
I have to get that codec.

7834
04:40:46,520 --> 04:40:49,340
It's so fun using the mic on EE and hearing her complain.

7835
04:40:49,700 --> 04:40:49,900
It's so fun using the mic on EE and hearing her complain.

7836
04:40:49,940 --> 04:40:51,880
There's just so much in this series.

7837
04:40:52,020 --> 04:40:53,960
Sorry, I know I'm always talking about Metal Gear.

7838
04:40:54,200 --> 04:40:54,340
Sorry, I know I'm always talking about Metal Gear.

7839
04:40:54,720 --> 04:40:55,960
I can't help it.

7840
04:40:56,840 --> 04:40:57,920
I can't help it.

7841
04:40:58,000 --> 04:41:00,200
It's because I have no one else to talk to about it.

7842
04:41:01,040 --> 04:41:02,520
So I'm like overflowing.

7843
04:41:02,640 --> 04:41:05,280
Whenever I meet with my friend Maddie...

7844
04:41:05,780 --> 04:41:06,520
Oh, that's Raspberry.

7845
04:41:08,300 --> 04:41:09,480
I'm just like...

7846
04:41:09,480 --> 04:41:11,280
We are just like...

7847
04:41:11,280 --> 04:41:12,340
Non-stop like...

7848
04:41:15,360 --> 04:41:17,260
Because she and I share...

7849
04:41:17,260 --> 04:41:18,560
This same brain ride.

7850
04:41:18,720 --> 04:41:20,200
And it's so nice.

7851
04:41:20,460 --> 04:41:21,140
It's so awesome.

7852
04:41:21,440 --> 04:41:23,520
I really want to play Resident Evil...

7853
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:25,480
Next so that I can also...

7854
04:41:28,160 --> 04:41:29,260
So that I can also...

7855
04:41:29,260 --> 04:41:30,300
Talk to her about it.

7856
04:41:30,440 --> 04:41:33,260
So I don't plan on playing...

7857
04:41:33,880 --> 04:41:35,060
Through the series again.

7858
04:41:35,240 --> 04:41:36,620
Not super soon.

7859
04:41:37,020 --> 04:41:37,900
Soon-ish.

7860
04:41:38,100 --> 04:41:39,360
Maybe I'll probably start it...

7861
04:41:39,480 --> 04:41:39,660
This year.

7862
04:41:40,240 --> 04:41:41,400
I mean it's only April.

7863
04:41:43,200 --> 04:41:43,600
But...

7864
04:41:45,320 --> 04:41:45,720
Yeah.

7865
04:41:49,720 --> 04:41:51,320
You have to get into No More Heroes.

7866
04:41:51,540 --> 04:41:51,820
Yeah!

7867
04:41:53,000 --> 04:41:53,700
I do.

7868
04:41:53,840 --> 04:41:55,220
So I can talk to her about that too.

7869
04:41:57,280 --> 04:41:57,680
Yeah.

7870
04:41:57,860 --> 04:41:59,900
Think you'll have a lot of fun playing Resident Evil?

7871
04:42:00,140 --> 04:42:01,040
Yeah, I hope so.

7872
04:42:09,170 --> 04:42:10,990
I have no clue about MGS...

7873
04:42:10,990 --> 04:42:13,050
But I'm happy to have the chance to know about it...

7874
04:42:13,050 --> 04:42:14,310
With your second playthrough.

7875
04:42:14,650 --> 04:42:14,710
Oh!

7876
04:42:16,430 --> 04:42:16,910
Raisin!

7877
04:42:17,070 --> 04:42:17,550
Yes!

7878
04:42:19,390 --> 04:42:20,630
I hope you like it...

7879
04:42:20,630 --> 04:42:21,390
As much as...

7880
04:42:21,390 --> 04:42:22,750
As much as I do.

7881
04:42:26,750 --> 04:42:27,230
So...

7882
04:42:27,230 --> 04:42:28,130
Oh boy.

7883
04:42:28,290 --> 04:42:29,430
This is gonna be good.

7884
04:42:32,530 --> 04:42:35,150
Resident Evil also has some great deep lore to uncover.

7885
04:42:35,430 --> 04:42:37,090
But not as much as the...

7886
04:42:37,850 --> 04:42:40,210
Bungai Game Meta Universe Mono...

7887
04:42:40,210 --> 04:42:40,650
What the...

7888
04:42:41,170 --> 04:42:43,230
Those were words that you strung together?

7889
04:42:46,090 --> 04:42:46,650
Yes.

7890
04:42:49,750 --> 04:42:52,990
Original or remakes for the first four REs?

7891
04:42:54,230 --> 04:42:54,790
Original or remakes for the first four REs?

7892
04:42:54,790 --> 04:42:54,970
I...

7893
04:42:55,550 --> 04:42:56,110
Don't...

7894
04:42:56,110 --> 04:42:58,350
Really want to play the first...

7895
04:42:58,350 --> 04:42:59,550
Resident Evil...

7896
04:43:00,070 --> 04:43:00,590
Original.

7897
04:43:01,610 --> 04:43:02,650
I don't know.

7898
04:43:04,230 --> 04:43:05,770
Have you played any...

7899
04:43:05,770 --> 04:43:06,830
Resident Evil game before?

7900
04:43:06,970 --> 04:43:09,150
I've only played a little bit of Resident Evil 1.

7901
04:43:09,250 --> 04:43:09,710
The original.

7902
04:43:12,070 --> 04:43:12,590
So...

7903
04:43:13,570 --> 04:43:14,610
The game company.

7904
04:43:14,710 --> 04:43:15,610
All their games are connected.

7905
04:43:15,890 --> 04:43:16,050
Oh!

7906
04:43:17,630 --> 04:43:18,370
Got it.

7907
04:43:18,410 --> 04:43:22,510
From what I understand...

7908
04:43:22,510 --> 04:43:23,070
Is...

7909
04:43:23,070 --> 04:43:25,310
The remakes for Resident Evil...

7910
04:43:26,110 --> 04:43:27,070
All pretty good?

7911
04:43:27,790 --> 04:43:29,350
From what I understand?

7912
04:43:30,470 --> 04:43:31,310
I think?

7913
04:43:31,690 --> 04:43:32,690
Hey, bubba girl.

7914
04:43:33,110 --> 04:43:35,150
Hey, commies, fries, mints...

7915
04:43:36,270 --> 04:43:36,790
Thief.

7916
04:43:37,150 --> 04:43:38,030
It cuts off.

7917
04:43:40,910 --> 04:43:41,430
Liam!

7918
04:43:41,570 --> 04:43:42,290
Thank you!

7919
04:43:43,650 --> 04:43:45,750
I enjoy hearing you talk about MGS.

7920
04:43:45,890 --> 04:43:47,670
It's how I am about Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

7921
04:43:47,730 --> 04:43:49,150
And Ace Combat to a lesser degree.

7922
04:43:50,370 --> 04:43:51,850
It's fun to be...

7923
04:43:51,850 --> 04:43:53,350
Super into something, right?

7924
04:43:54,690 --> 04:43:55,750
All the remakes...

7925
04:43:56,110 --> 04:43:56,610
3 are good.

7926
04:43:58,650 --> 04:44:00,650
RE3 and 4 are downgrades for me.

7927
04:44:00,830 --> 04:44:02,090
See, I heard a lot of people say...

7928
04:44:02,090 --> 04:44:03,650
RE4 remake is pretty good.

7929
04:44:04,730 --> 04:44:06,130
But I had not...

7930
04:44:06,130 --> 04:44:06,990
Heard about 3.

7931
04:44:07,530 --> 04:44:08,710
3 is a bit bare bones.

7932
04:44:10,110 --> 04:44:10,750
I see.

7933
04:44:11,490 --> 04:44:12,610
3 is just short.

7934
04:44:12,990 --> 04:44:15,770
I see.

7935
04:44:15,910 --> 04:44:16,170
I see.

7936
04:44:17,550 --> 04:44:18,910
Played any Castlevania before?

7937
04:44:19,130 --> 04:44:20,690
I've played Symphony of the Night.

7938
04:44:21,630 --> 04:44:22,070
Yes.

7939
04:44:23,290 --> 04:44:23,690
OK.

7940
04:44:24,390 --> 04:44:26,570
I should really go to bed since it's almost 3 AM.

7941
04:44:26,870 --> 04:44:28,030
I should really go to bed.

7942
04:44:28,450 --> 04:44:29,950
Thank you guys for sticking around.

7943
04:44:30,790 --> 04:44:32,390
I really want to talk more...

7944
04:44:32,390 --> 04:44:33,830
Because we haven't been able to talk the whole time.

7945
04:44:34,150 --> 04:44:35,330
I should really go to bed.

7946
04:44:35,550 --> 04:44:37,950
We'll talk a lot more tomorrow when I play...

7947
04:44:38,690 --> 04:44:39,090
Stuff.

7948
04:44:39,890 --> 04:44:41,370
I'm planning to buy a Metal Gear series.

7949
04:44:41,510 --> 04:44:43,250
Any suggestions which one I should start with?

7950
04:44:43,550 --> 04:44:44,050
By the way...

7951
04:44:47,030 --> 04:44:47,830
Thank you!

7952
04:44:51,070 --> 04:44:51,650
Thank you!

7953
04:44:51,650 --> 04:44:52,770
Let's start with Metal Gear Solid!

7954
04:44:53,770 --> 04:44:55,890
All you gotta do is start with number 1.

7955
04:44:56,910 --> 04:44:57,690
Thank you!

7956
04:44:58,330 --> 04:45:01,250
It was great to see you collab with Emily again and Ayla and Naki too.

7957
04:45:01,570 --> 04:45:01,890
Yeah!

7958
04:45:02,810 --> 04:45:03,630
So fun.

7959
04:45:04,310 --> 04:45:06,910
They're such great girlies.

7960
04:45:07,970 --> 04:45:08,490
OK.

7961
04:45:09,290 --> 04:45:10,290
Thank you everybody!

7962
04:45:10,790 --> 04:45:12,590
Thank you so much.

7963
04:45:12,810 --> 04:45:13,690
Thank you.

7964
04:45:15,330 --> 04:45:16,310
Aylin, thank you!

7965
04:45:17,830 --> 04:45:19,790
Have you done your homework for this week?

7966
04:45:20,810 --> 04:45:21,550
What homework?

7967
04:45:21,950 --> 04:45:22,890
I had homework?

7968
04:45:23,970 --> 04:45:25,150
Late night mint is a real treat.

7969
04:45:25,250 --> 04:45:25,890
Thank you for the stream.

7970
04:45:25,970 --> 04:45:26,250
Thank you!

7971
04:45:27,770 --> 04:45:30,350
If only this was Friday night.

7972
04:45:30,450 --> 04:45:31,950
Maybe it would be better for some people.

7973
04:45:32,690 --> 04:45:34,330
Maybe some of you might have work tomorrow.

7974
04:45:34,450 --> 04:45:36,290
Please get some rest.

7975
04:45:36,690 --> 04:45:39,610
And I'll see you guys with Twin Snakes!

7976
04:45:40,410 --> 04:45:40,990
Bye bye!

7977
04:45:41,650 --> 04:45:42,310
You know what?

7978
04:45:42,310 --> 04:45:44,850
I'm not even gonna do the outro because the song is kinda loud.

7979
04:45:45,050 --> 04:45:46,410
I'm just gonna quit.

7980
04:45:46,550 --> 04:45:47,630
I'm just gonna stop from here.

7981
04:45:47,790 --> 04:45:48,850
So we're not even gonna do the outro.

7982
04:45:52,230 --> 04:45:52,710
Otsuminto!

7983
04:45:52,970 --> 04:45:53,450
Otsuminto!

7984
04:45:53,630 --> 04:45:54,110
Otsuminto!

7985
04:45:57,110 --> 04:45:58,070
Bye bye!

7986
04:45:58,190 --> 04:45:59,210
Thank you guys so much!

7987
04:45:59,330 --> 04:45:59,910
Get some rest!

7988
04:46:01,290 --> 04:46:02,250
Drink water!

7989
04:46:02,510 --> 04:46:03,150
Stand up and stretch!

7990
04:46:03,830 --> 04:46:04,530
See you!

7991
04:46:04,750 --> 04:46:05,410
Bye bye!

7992
04:46:07,530 --> 04:46:08,010
Otsuminto!

7993
04:46:09,890 --> 04:46:10,630
Bye bye!

7994
04:46:10,730 --> 04:46:11,410
Bye bye!

7995
04:46:11,410 --> 04:46:11,730
Bye bye!

7996
04:46:11,730 --> 04:46:11,870
Love you!

7997
04:46:11,910 --> 04:46:12,170
Bye bye!
