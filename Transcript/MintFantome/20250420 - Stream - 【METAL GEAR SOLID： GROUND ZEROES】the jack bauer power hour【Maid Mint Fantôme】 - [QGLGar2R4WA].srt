1
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,860
It says press enter key, but it's wrong.

2
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,380
It's supposed to be press start.

3
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,120
Oh!

4
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,100
There we go!

5
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,720
Yay!

6
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,080
Woo!

7
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Woo!

8
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Woo!

9
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,140
Round zebras.

10
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,500
Hello.

11
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,280
Glad your expo meet and greet went well.

12
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,240
Few things make me happier to see my friends.

13
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:01,620
Gosh.

14
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,600
Wait.

15
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,820
Gosh what?

16
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,180
Oh.

17
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,860
What am I?

18
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,420
My name?

19
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,220
Gosh about meeting their Oshi.

20
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,620
Yeah!

21
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,220
Oh my god.

22
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,580
It's been a busy day for me already.

23
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,340
I earlier had a meet and greet at Sakura-kun.

24
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,180
Sakura-kun!

25
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,480
I'm here!

26
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,900
And um... Uh... Clay!

27
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,920
Welcome to membership.

28
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,620
Thank you.

29
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,440
Um... And then I...

30
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,200
Impromptu went around Anime Ottawa.

31
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
DMCV today.

32
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,380
Yes... Yes... Wait.

33
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:42,720
No.

34
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,100
DMCV yesterday.

35
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,300
MGSV today.

36
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,260
It is the peak.

37
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,020
Week of peak.

38
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,580
Yeah.

39
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,820
I'm all over the world.

40
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,400
Grugamash.

41
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,720
It was fun though.

42
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,040
It was fun.

43
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
I always love doing meet and greets.

44
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,940
So... But the... The iPad at Anime Ottawa was impromptu.

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,260
Like... Maybe like an hour or two before my meet and greet at Sakura-kun.

46
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,280
Some off-kai staff messaged me and they're like...

47
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,580
Do you wanna go around on the iPad?

48
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,000
I was like... Yeah!

49
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,100
Yeah!

50
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
I wanna do that!

51
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,940
And then they were taking me around.

52
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,000
They were just like... Okay we're headed to the artist alley.

53
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,820
And I was like...

54
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,640
I thought there was a fire there.

55
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,680
And they're like...

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Oh!

57
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,520
That's...

58
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,400
In a different country.

59
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,760
I was like...

60
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,560
Where am I?

61
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,740
I was like...

62
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:33,880
Wait.

63
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,380
What do you mean a different country?

64
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,200
I didn't even know where I was.

65
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,300
You were just at Anime Ottawa.

66
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,160
I know!

67
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,580
I was the goober in the fauna hat.

68
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,340
Mike!

69
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,080
Thank you.

70
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh my gosh.

71
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,500
My voice is kind of dead today.

72
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:50,940
It seems.

73
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,320
Hold on.

74
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm gonna have...

75
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,480
Let me have some...

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,860
Maybe too much talking today.

77
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,480
Too much talking.

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,260
Where are we?

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,860
I don't know!

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,700
I don't know!

81
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,760
Hold on.

82
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,260
I have two.

83
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,530
Yeah!

84
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,630
I need a Google Maps.

85
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,350
Any more con visits in the future?

86
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,410
Sure.

87
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,510
I'd love to.

88
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,300
I can't say I have any more right now, though.

89
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,420
Look out!

90
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,840
Thank you so much for the attack.

91
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,880
Thank you.

92
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,640
Minto, voice crack you.

93
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,120
No!

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,460
I was there in Sakura-kan.

95
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,080
I was wearing all white.

96
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,780
You're the best...

97
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,520
Best, Minto.

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,840
Wearing all white?

99
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,540
Were you...

100
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,600
The one that made the...

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,340
The wisp?

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,680
Sheet?

103
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

104
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,960
That?

105
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,660
Hi, Minto.

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,580
Hello, hello, hello!

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,940
Hello, hello, wow.

108
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,160
But yeah, so...

109
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,600
So it was, uh...

110
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,460
It was busy.

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,400
And now...

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,440
We're playing...

113
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,480
Ground Zeroes.

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,060
And your goals!

115
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,280
Thank you so much for the 20 games.

116
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,940
Thank you!

117
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
It's always fun seeing you play MDS.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,860
I love Ground Zeroes.

119
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,940
It's so fun, actually.

120
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,360
So excited to send over Supo on my birthday!

121
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,820
City Beast, happy birthday!

122
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,220
Thank you so much for all the...

123
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,180
For all your funny and awesome playthroughs of the Metal Gear series.

124
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,920
Thank you!

125
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:09,160
In terms of playthrough, the way it looks, the way it plays... Oh my gosh, I say this all the time, but... It truly feels like it could have come out, like... Three years ago.

126
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:22,420
Like, it's so... If you play any... If you're not interested in story at all, but you want to play Metal Gear... Play at least, like, Grounds... Oh my gosh, it plays so stinking good.

127
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,780
Everything is so clean.

128
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,420
I know!

129
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,740
These games actually play so well.

130
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,700
Like, they're just so fun to play, actually.

131
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,740
So... 2014 was like five years ago.

132
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,660
Yeah!

133
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,000
It shocks me how few games play like it.

134
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,600
It's just... It's actually crazy that this game is ten years old.

135
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,720
Like, it's so... Wow!

136
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,720
Over ten years old!

137
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,740
So... What, three was a great birthday gift yesterday?

138
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,260
I mean, though...

139
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,600
Happy birthday!

140
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,280
Thank you for streaming so badly.

141
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,880
Oh, wait!

142
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh, we have two more birthdays.

143
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,800
One more time!

144
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Happy birthday to you!

145
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Happy birthday to you!

146
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Happy birthday, dear Red!

147
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,780
Happy birthday to you!

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,040
One more time!

149
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,200
Happy birthday to you.

150
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,340
Happy birthday to you.

151
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,480
Happy birthday, A.G.

152
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,420
Aragorn.

153
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,220
Happy birthday to you.

154
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,980
Wow, one more time.

155
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,160
Happy birthday to you.

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,280
Happy birthday to you.

157
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,660
Happy birthday to you.

158
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,880
Happy birthday, dear Christopher.

159
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,780
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to you!

160
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,840
Happy birthday.

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,320
Wow, I don't think I've ever done a triple key change before.

162
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,180
That's a new record, I'd say.

163
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,860
It's not my birthday, but Wrestlemania's today, so I'll celebrate that.

164
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,880
But yeah, you're still watching the wrestles.

165
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,060
Three months?

166
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,600
How?

167
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,840
Thank you for three months, Salkin!

168
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,420
Thank you.

169
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,300
So you're saying people should play V if they haven't even played anything else?

170
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,920
Don't get it twisted.

171
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,240
I'm saying if you don't care about the story and all you want to do is play a fun game...

172
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,240
Play V.

173
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,180
I mean, the other games are fun too, but these play... I mean, these are really unique.

174
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,180
These don't play like any of the other Metal Gear games at all.

175
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,480
Get it twisted.

176
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,000
No!

177
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,860
Don't get it twisted.

178
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,720
Don't get it twisted.

179
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:56,460
Don't... don't... don't... don't clip it out of context and have... and cut my words that makes me say...

180
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,060
Play Metal Gear Solid V first.

181
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,340
Because I don't... would not ever say that.

182
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,820
It's also pretty crazy long.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,480
Oh my god!

184
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,020
It is cra...

185
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,260
Five is very long.

186
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,400
Thank you for streaming, Mint.

187
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
I have a stomach flu.

188
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,820
Oh no, feel better, Okami!

189
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,160
M'lady Mint.

190
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,340
Thou art a tempest most divine.

191
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,760
Might I, a lowly wretch, bask beneath...

192
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,960
Nope, I'm not reading the rest of that.

193
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,060
Denied!

194
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,280
Denied!

195
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,580
Denied!

196
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,040
It was so eloquent though.

197
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,880
I played Ground Zeroes first time in a week ago.

198
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,840
Started playing Phantom Pain, I'm so excited.

199
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,820
Woo, let's go!

200
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,780
About to get so bent and watch this whole stream.

201
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
I love MGS.

202
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,180
Yay!

203
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,860
Yippee!

204
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,520
I love MGS too.

205
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,640
I mean, also.

206
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,700
I mean, I also love MGS too.

207
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,220
But, um...

208
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,100
Yeah, so...

209
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,100
So, you might notice also my completion ratio is 18%.

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,080
That's because today I intend on playing the original, like the main mission.

211
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,340
The reason we're here.

212
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,000
To continue the story.

213
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,920
Which I'm kind of like...

214
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,300
Do I play the main mission last?

215
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Because after we play the main mission...

216
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,320
I would also like to play...

217
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,700
Uh, this one.

218
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,340
Which you'll...

219
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,000
You will know.

220
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,120
And then...

221
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,120
I've actually never have played Deja Vu.

222
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,200
So it will be my first time actually playing Deja Vu.

223
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,240
Mission.

224
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,160
And then also this, uh, very...

225
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,380
Mysterious character.

226
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,420
That's...

227
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,200
That doesn't look like Snake at all.

228
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,040
Who could that be?

229
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,760
So...

230
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,380
Oh my gosh.

231
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,080
Another birthday.

232
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,300
It's my friend Mari's birthday.

233
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,000
And she's in stream.

234
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,020
I hope you can say her happy birthday.

235
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,640
I will.

236
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,360
Happy birthday to you.

237
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,840
Happy birthday to you.

238
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,680
Happy birthday dear Mari.

239
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,740
I see you.

240
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
I see you.

241
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Happy birthday to you.

242
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,600
Happy birthday.

243
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,060
Well yeah.

244
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,800
So that's what I want to do today.

245
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,800
Um...

246
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,460
So...

247
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,020
If you were just gonna be like...

248
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,340
Oh...

249
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,660
She's gotta get all the patches.

250
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,080
I already did.

251
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,160
I already did that.

252
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,680
And then these ones we don't really have to do.

253
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,020
You know?

254
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,040
Um...

255
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,840
This one...

256
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,140
This one we don't have to do.

257
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,360
This one we don't have to do.

258
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I also already took these guys home.

259
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
So I will have them in...

260
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,240
And if you...

261
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,620
If you...

262
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,320
If you instead of assassinating them...

263
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,420
If you...

264
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,120
Um...

265
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
If you steal them...

266
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:14,980
Then...

267
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,140
You get to have them.

268
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,420
Why...

269
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,900
Why was that guy staring at me?

270
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,540
Did you see that?

271
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,140
The...

272
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,540
The guy right there?

273
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,740
Why were they staring at me?

274
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,520
When do we get the side mission of opening Ka's Burger Shop?

275
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,780
We're not there yet!

276
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,680
It was nice saying hi at the meeting earlier.

277
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,220
I was the one with the gunplay case.

278
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,280
Oh yeah yeah yeah!

279
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,620
I'm gonna treasure the checky.

280
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,200
Thank you.

281
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,440
You were dripped out.

282
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,700
So...

283
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,380
Minto likes MGS.

284
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,700
She also likes MGS2 too.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,040
A good part of MGS2 takes place on April 30th.

286
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,060
April 30th is in a few days.

287
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,040
April 30th was in DMC5.

288
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,040
Which Minto also played yesterday.

289
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,320
Kojima predicted it all!

290
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,620
Truth?

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,440
Okay.

292
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,240
Shall we get started?

293
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,200
On Ground Zeroes.

294
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,620
I feel...

295
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,460
Like I said, I feel kind of weird doing this.

296
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,400
Because Ground Zeroes mission is kind of heavy compared to the other missions.

297
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,740
Um, but we'll, we'll, we'll have, we'll get all the sad stuff out of the way.

298
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,680
And then we'll finish it off with some, uh, some, uh, silliness.

299
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,040
Yeah.

300
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
Even though I fa...

301
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,520
Just found the VTuber community about a year ago.

302
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,460
You've definitely become my favorite.

303
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:42,860
Whoa!

304
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,320
Thank you, Dreadnought.

305
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,220
Thank you.

306
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,180
I'm iNerd.

307
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,660
Play Deja Vu mission.

308
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,080
Oh my gosh!

309
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,540
Lambda!

310
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,840
Don't send so much!

311
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,340
I...

312
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,520
I literally said I was gonna play it!

313
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,660
I literally said!

314
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,700
Anyway.

315
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,900
Let's go.

316
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,040
There we go!

317
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,760
Hot dog!

318
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,560
Hot dog!

319
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,370
Every time I ask this...

320
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,070
If this N5 is canon, I get it's complicated.

321
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:15,750
What do you...

322
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:15,910
What?

323
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,730
Yes!

324
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,470
Why would anybody say that this game is not canon?

325
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:20,990
What?

326
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,230
No.

327
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,550
This...

328
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,510
This game and N5 are canon, huh?

329
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,410
I think that's not...

330
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,230
Oh!

331
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,530
I don't think that is...

332
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,390
Is disputed amongst fans, is it?

333
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,210
I don't think...

334
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,270
I don't think that's disputed.

335
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:41,590
Okay!

336
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,990
Thank you so much for the 5gripton.

337
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,590
I know people say that about like portable ops, but...

338
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,950
These two games are 100% canon.

339
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:52,910
Yeah...

340
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,430
Huh.

341
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:55,710
Um...

342
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:55,830
Oh.

343
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,290
Uh, these...

344
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:57,910
These like...

345
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,710
Okay, maybe we...

346
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,910
Wait.

347
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,670
Okay, hold on.

348
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,210
Oh.

349
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,210
In an era when the world was still divided into East and West.

350
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,570
The boss, the mother of special...

351
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,370
Oh, I think this is just a recap.

352
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,730
Yeah.

353
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,350
This is all just a recap.

354
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,770
Well, don't worry.

355
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,530
There are actual cutscenes, so...

356
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,390
We'll start.

357
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,300
It's been a long time since I've watched these cutscenes, actually.

358
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,740
Thank god there aren't dogs in this game.

359
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,060
Like, actually...

360
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,920
Who's this guy?

361
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,220
Who is this guy?

362
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,700
Everybody else has like their little ponchos on.

363
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,620
Oh, he lost his hat!

364
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,540
A child.

365
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,520
Whoa.

366
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,880
See that?

367
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,920
Did you see that?

368
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,760
Did you see it?

369
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,640
He told us everything.

370
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,780
Don't worry.

371
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,280
I kept my word.

372
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
He didn't suffer long.

373
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,400
He's got his airpods in.

374
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,340
He can't hear you.

375
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,740
Here.

376
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,680
Bink, bink.

377
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,080
Oh.

378
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,080
You earned it.

379
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,920
The tapes.

380
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,000
Ooh.

381
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,100
How's it feel to play the traitor?

382
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
No more wargames.

383
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,200
You're a real man now, soldier.

384
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,460
Tyco!

385
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,020
Tyco!

386
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,060
What do you mean, but...

387
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,340
What do you mean traitor?

388
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,580
What's he listening to?

389
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,140
Drop the mixtape.

390
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,600
Give my regards to your boss when you get home.

391
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,290
Oh, what is that one?

392
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:39,730
Oh.

393
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,690
This mic...

394
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,520
This will probably get...

395
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,850
Copyright struck, but that's okay.

396
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,190
We'll show this cutscene to show how good the graphics would be in the future.

397
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,010
Still looks amazing.

398
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,410
It looks so good.

399
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,310
It looks so good.

400
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,630
Thanks to you, meepola and Bob.

401
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,880
Oh, try princess.

402
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,150
10 days ago, we got reports that Paz was still alive.

403
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,250
She's alive.

404
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,490
She was rescued by a Belizean fisherman who found a drifting in the Caribbean.

405
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,050
So what's the plan?

406
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,470
Silence her before we're compromised?

407
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,990
No.

408
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,150
I've got something else in mind.

409
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,830
Our friends at Cypher suspect Paz could be a double agent.

410
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,670
She's being held for interrogation at a camp on the southern tip of Cuba.

411
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,790
Black Sight.

412
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,510
Nice.

413
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,430
A slice of American pie on communist soil and out of US legal jurisdiction.

414
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,590
It's not David Hayter.

415
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,670
The actual inspection of Mother Base has to be connected somehow.

416
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,130
I know, it's really weird here, Ian.

417
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,370
The time is too perfect.

418
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,590
The UN's nuclear inspection.

419
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,610
He talks more in this game than he doesn't be.

420
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,030
He talks more in this game than Paz is late.

421
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,630
We're an army.

422
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,850
What if our capabilities get us out?

423
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,850
And they'll have the whole world out to shut us down.

424
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,830
Having an American private intelligence agency involved, bad news.

425
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,050
Cypher's the ones who sent Paz to us in the first place.

426
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,690
She knows the true nature.

427
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:32,710
Right.

428
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,990
Paz is our only link to Cypher.

429
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,350
If she's still alive, we need her on our side.

430
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,570
We need her on our side.

431
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,630
We need her on our side.

432
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,610
We need her on our side.

433
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:45,810
We need her on our side.

434
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,830
Yeah, he talks more in this...

435
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,010
I didn't realize how much he talked in this cutscene.

436
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,910
He's coherent.

437
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,590
He's...

438
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,590
I mean, after.

439
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,930
It'd be you.

440
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,970
Well, okay.

441
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:00,930
I'm gonna shut my mouth.

442
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,270
I was gonna say something that spoils the end of this.

443
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,690
But I won't say anything.

444
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,610
I'm not gonna say anything.

445
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,470
Don't say anything.

446
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,210
Don't say anything, guys.

447
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,450
XOF.

448
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,770
Oh.

449
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,270
No spoilers.

450
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,590
No spoilers.

451
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,830
Trojan horse.

452
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,210
Look

453
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,780
at that.

454
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,860
Skull face.

455
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,360
It looks like a...

456
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,420
It looks like a lizard.

457
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,040
Like a...

458
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,480
It looks like an actual snake look.

459
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,140
Snake man.

460
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,820
Skull face.

461
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,100
Let's go!

462
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,640
Oh gosh.

463
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,860
These light flares kill me.

464
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,260
My eyes.

465
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,720
He's like, that's what the helicopter does.

466
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,980
Kojima really loves his lens flare.

467
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,740
The lens flare in this game is so iconic that you can, like, get mods for it in other games.

468
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,860
So who's the other target?

469
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,800
That would be Chico.

470
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,500
Chico!

471
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,120
Being held in the same area as Paz.

472
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,380
Well, take off your patches.

473
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,940
The last radio contact was 40 hours ago.

474
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,280
Take off your patches.

475
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
Bring him back alive.

476
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,840
That guy is ugly.

477
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,540
I don't think that's like a really...

478
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,320
Like...

479
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,480
I don't think that's a reliable way of disposing of them.

480
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,680
I don't know, I could be wrong, but...

481
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah!

482
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,820
We'll send a chopper from across the Cuban border.

483
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,800
You should be back at Mother Base in time for lunch.

484
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,280
Yeah!

485
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,500
You'll probably just miss our guests.

486
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,680
The only catch is, you go and solo.

487
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,460
Of course.

488
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,320
The politically sensitive nature of the mission meets backup is not an option.

489
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,240
Fine.

490
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,360
I like some alone time now and then.

491
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Do I bother with the badges and XOF signs at that point?

492
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,240
I don't know.

493
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,020
You know.

494
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,900
For dramatics.

495
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,300
For dramatics.

496
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,640
Oh, sorry, I'm blocking the names.

497
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,140
My head is literally right on top of the credits.

498
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,820
Christopher Randolph.

499
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:01,980
He

500
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,360
just slowed you down one bit.

501
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,650
Kiefer Sutherland.

502
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,190
He said the thing!

503
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,990
He said it!

504
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,330
He said it!

505
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,310
I recognized it!

506
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,770
Oh my gosh, it looks so awesome.

507
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:04,200
I obviously don't want to talk so much about the Kiefer Sutherland, David Hayter... debate... at the moment.

508
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,480
Oh, we got our eye droid!

509
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,380
We can talk a little bit about it.

510
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,580
The eye droid is so cool!

511
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,060
Alright, welcome!

512
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,380
Okay.

513
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,580
Look at this, guys.

514
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't think I'll do that, but thank you.

515
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,300
Let's see, let's capture some guys.

516
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,080
Welcome to Ground Zeroes, if this is your first time.

517
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,700
Seeing how the game plays...

518
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,520
Holy, look at this, we get to mark enemies.

519
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,320
Deja Vu Mission, hell yeah!

520
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,500
Yeah!

521
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,800
Thank you, Lefto!

522
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,580
Look at this, look how...

523
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,660
Gosh, I can't ever get over how nice this game looks.

524
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,200
We got that guy!

525
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,820
Is there someone in there?

526
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,740
Nobody in there?

527
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,720
Oh, there's the other man.

528
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,660
I was waiting for him.

529
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,800
Yeah!

530
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,160
It looks so good, no?

531
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,300
Alright, give me a second.

532
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,420
I gotta get used to how things are again.

533
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,560
Oh, I got a sniper.

534
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,780
I got a rocket launcher.

535
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,400
Do I have anything else over here?

536
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,100
No?

537
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,860
Hmm...

538
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,080
They gave us some little goodies.

539
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,270
You think he'll see me?

540
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,050
Let's see.

541
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,750
No, I don't want the night vision.

542
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,450
Let's attach...

543
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,570
Try rolling, I already got the patches.

544
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,990
So, I don't need to roll.

545
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,470
I already got the patches.

546
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,540
Let's see.

547
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,420
Keep low.

548
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,160
You can check the controls on the pause screen.

549
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,260
Thanks, guys!

550
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,720
If you ready your weapon while crawling, you can move horizontally left or right.

551
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,080
If you do that holding the dash button, you'll move faster.

552
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,460
Um, I don't know if I can get this guy.

553
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,040
Let's try.

554
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:20,860
Ugh.

555
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,240
I don't even know if I'm reaching him.

556
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,240
My eyes!

557
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
So, we gotta go grab Chico...

558
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,160
And pause...

559
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,460
Where's our map?

560
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,140
Here we go.

561
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,700
So...

562
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,890
If we're heading that way over there...

563
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,820
Whoa...

564
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,780
Whoa, look how fancy everything is!

565
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,040
Crawl on the ground like the snake you are.

566
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,360
Where'd that other guy go?

567
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,640
Another guy that I...

568
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,260
Oh, there he is.

569
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,620
Oh!

570
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,740
I did get him!

571
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,200
Nah!

572
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,400
I didn't even realize.

573
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,640
He didn't even react.

574
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,880
Okay, nice.

575
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:05,700
And...

576
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,620
Please.

577
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,260
Oh my gosh.

578
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,840
My controller.

579
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,320
Oh!

580
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,700
There we go.

581
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,820
I didn't even realize I got him!

582
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,580
Let's go.

583
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,060
Better tech in the 70s.

584
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,540
I know!

585
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,280
That's one thing about these games.

586
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,700
It's like the technology regresses so hard.

587
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,900
Oh, he's on his way back.

588
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,670
Oh, maybe not.

589
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,850
This guy is fine too.

590
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,410
Now head east to the old prison area.

591
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:39,850
Okay.

592
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,530
Bring up the target's location on your eye droid.

593
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,990
Let's make sure.

594
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,150
Are there any people over here?

595
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,790
Oh, there's a guy.

596
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,210
Everybody's sick in this game.

597
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,210
Whoa, mama!

598
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,550
Johnny Bravo!

599
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,130
Yeah.

600
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,370
I tried to help marking them as well, but it only marked you for some reason.

601
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,490
Probably because my binoculars can only see pretty ladies!

602
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,640
Mr. Bravo!

603
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,740
Hold on, I wonder if I can get this guy.

604
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,320
Oh my god, I didn't realize there was a truck coming!

605
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,300
Um, I'm so dead maybe.

606
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,880
Snake, get in the bush!

607
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay.

608
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:35,950
Did I get him?

609
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,020
Maybe I got him.

610
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,070
I don't want to get his light yet.

611
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,910
I don't want them to notice.

612
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,090
I hit the rail?

613
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:51,750
No way.

614
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,350
I can't tell.

615
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,710
If the first one hit him or not.

616
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:56,770
No!

617
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,400
I haven't played the main mission in so long, you guys.

618
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,060
Oh.

619
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,500
Let's try.

620
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,560
What enemy?

621
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,500
Enemy has left the area.

622
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,360
What are you talking about?

623
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,400
What are you talking about?

624
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,440
Okay.

625
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,740
He should fall asleep.

626
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,040
Like, any second.

627
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,160
I'm worried about the second part of this mission.

628
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,280
I can do the first part, not so bad, but...

629
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,860
Oh, the jeep!

630
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

631
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,320
Stop shining that light in my face, mister.

632
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,240
Oh, there he goes.

633
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:38,820
Nice.

634
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,120
Wait.

635
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,620
How do I turn my flashlight off?

636
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,420
Wait, how do I...

637
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,460
Yeah, how do I turn it off?

638
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,860
It turned on.

639
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,620
I don't know why.

640
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,080
Wait.

641
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,700
Oh, God!

642
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,820
It got dicey.

643
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,320
Hold...

644
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,520
Hold...

645
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:56,740
I'm...

646
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,200
I'm playing!

647
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,700
Hold up d-pad, then press triangle.

648
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,280
Thank you.

649
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:10,860
Okay.

650
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,520
There we go.

651
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,920
Thank you.

652
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
I'm playing with not...

653
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,160
Oh.

654
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,660
There we go.

655
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,540
Please don't say...

656
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,940
JP, this is Zulu...

657
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,580
Zulu 1.

658
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,660
Lied out, and we don't know why.

659
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,340
Someone go investigate.

660
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,160
The snake cake.

661
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,240
It's so real, baby.

662
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,340
Oh, yeah.

663
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,140
Sorry, more light.

664
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,820
Okay.

665
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,560
Okay.

666
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,240
Okay.

667
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,640
Did I get him?

668
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,120
I can't tell...

669
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,180
Oh.

670
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,700
Thanks, guys.

671
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,540
Guys just backseats his entire way through this game.

672
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,260
He's playing to a Hollywood actor who never played a video game in his life.

673
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,420
The plot of Three and Peace Walker.

674
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,220
I know, right?

675
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,300
He feel asleep?

676
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,860
Hello, Minto.

677
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,360
Hello.

678
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,760
Please go to bed.

679
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,440
Please.

680
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,840
Investigate the Mickey noises.

681
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,260
No!

682
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,180
Wait, hold on.

683
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,800
I know there's some guys over here, right?

684
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:27,880
Okay.

685
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,620
Let's grab.

686
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,200
No?

687
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,480
No?

688
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,700
Pretty empty.

689
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,500
Ugh!

690
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,440
Spooking.

691
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,580
Please go to sleep!

692
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,940
I'll crawl through the...

693
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,280
The bushes for now.

694
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,980
This guy scares me.

695
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,260
It's directed right where we need to go.

696
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,300
It's directed right where we need to go.

697
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,800
Hate it when there are guys.

698
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,500
I know!

699
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,140
Why can't you like...

700
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,860
Just...

701
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,340
Not exist.

702
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,740
In the game.

703
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,030
Nice shot, thank you.

704
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,110
And then you can do this.

705
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:15,690
Oh.

706
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,230
Nevermind.

707
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,250
It didn't let me press the triangle.

708
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,130
Contact me if you need advice.

709
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,010
Oh my god!

710
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,430
Even if I don't have anything to say to you, you still...

711
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,830
Kaz loves to hear himself talk.

712
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,390
My man is so lonely.

713
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,380
You think I can get him...

714
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,220
Oh god!

715
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,480
My eyes!

716
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,920
I hear a cough.

717
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,420
How's the audio, by the way, guys?

718
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,840
Please, did I get you?

719
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,100
The light is shining!

720
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
It shines so bright!

721
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,680
Please!

722
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,260
It's good?

723
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,600
Okay.

724
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,560
It's like when those cars have LED lights.

725
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,960
And then you have a short car and it's like a...

726
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,560
It's a big truck behind you.

727
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,540
Oh, there we go.

728
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:13,880
Finally.

729
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, wow!

730
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,980
I got a new record!

731
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:24,750
Finally!

732
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,370
I'm gonna waste all my tranks on...

733
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,350
I'm gonna waste all my stuff on this guy!

734
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,760
Okay.

735
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,620
Onward.

736
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,680
Hold on.

737
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,600
Is there someone in there?

738
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,070
Oh!

739
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,950
I've never heard...

740
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,970
I don't remember this.

741
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:55,370
I've never heard...

742
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,830
I don't remember this.

743
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,850
My buddy was crying on my shoulder about it.

744
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,230
But that place has been dead for years.

745
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,470
Now we got these...

746
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,170
I don't know who's bringing in...

747
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,590
My car is low as hell and it blinds me every time.

748
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,490
Oh my god!

749
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,170
Oh my god!

750
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,970
I did not see that guy!

751
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,170
I can't adjust...

752
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,090
Oops.

753
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,610
Bad shot.

754
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,590
Good shot.

755
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,670
Let's move you...

756
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,100
Um...

757
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,560
Not here.

758
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,560
Come here.

759
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,880
Come over here.

760
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,750
Let's put you...

761
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,460
In...

762
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,100
Here!

763
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,100
There we go!

764
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,340
There we go!

765
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,340
Okay!

766
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,170
Now...

767
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,950
I know there's a guy...

768
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,350
No?

769
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,850
Unless it was...

770
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,390
I see that guy in there.

771
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:58,950
Eepy time!

772
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,930
So eepy sleepy!

773
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,390
Let's check up here.

774
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,350
Also...

775
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,830
For anyone wondering...

776
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,050
I have already gotten all the prisoners.

777
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,650
Like I've already taken them home before.

778
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:17,990
Except...

779
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,690
One.

780
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,150
But I think I've already missed him anyway.

781
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,710
I still haven't been able to get him before.

782
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,110
There's one...

783
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,810
If you didn't know...

784
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,450
There's one secret guy...

785
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,410
We're kind of close to where we...

786
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,010
Started the game.

787
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,010
That you can get...

788
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,810
You think you can get him?

789
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,830
From here?

790
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,810
Oh, don't move.

791
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,090
Wait, where are you going?

792
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,130
Where are you going?

793
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,190
Okay, nevermind.

794
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,910
That's the old prison area.

795
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:44,390
Yeah.

796
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,170
The targets are there.

797
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:45,570
Yeah.

798
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,430
Yeah.

799
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,350
Ooh...

800
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,170
Yeah, but it's okay.

801
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,270
We don't...

802
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,510
We...

803
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,350
Sorry prisoners.

804
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,630
Sorry prisoners.

805
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,990
You know, it's just one of those things.

806
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,350
Look at...

807
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,090
He's already sleepy.

808
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,030
And this guy...

809
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,630
Where is he?

810
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,610
I don't think I can get him from here.

811
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,030
I think that's...

812
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,650
I think it's just these two, no?

813
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,210
I think?

814
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,570
Hmm...

815
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,330
Just one of those days...

816
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:20,830
Yeah...

817
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,330
Eepy sleepy.

818
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:27,820
Oh...

819
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,280
Let's...

820
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,320
Let's see if we can get him now.

821
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,540
Maybe?

822
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,820
I don't know if I can get him now.

823
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,360
Through here.

824
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,840
Let's try.

825
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,820
I might be able to be...

826
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh...

827
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,210
I think I got him.

828
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,470
Sort of laundry detergent does MSF use.

829
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,290
Okay.

830
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,250
Now...

831
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,390
We hope he doesn't see this fellow.

832
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,630
You know what?

833
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:00,990
Hold on.

834
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,910
There we go.

835
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,510
Now he won't see that fellow.

836
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,230
And there's no one up there.

837
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,900
Nice shot.

838
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,480
Thank you.

839
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,100
Oh wait.

840
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,060
Uh...

841
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,880
Return to the sea!

842
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,140
Return to the sea!

843
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
This guy, too.

844
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,840
Return to the sea!

845
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,080
Return to the sea!

846
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,720
Return to the sea!

847
00:39:59,720 --> 00:39:59,960
Return to the sea!

848
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,960
Actually...

849
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,000
Are there rocks down there?

850
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,300
I don't think I heard a splash.

851
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,500
Uh...

852
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,600
Return to the sea!

853
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,720
Return to the sea!

854
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:10,820
Yay!

855
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,720
There he goes.

856
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,540
I didn't hear a splash before.

857
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,300
Yeah, I heard a splat.

858
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,600
Sorry, guy.

859
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,770
Chico!

860
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,190
Chico!

861
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,690
Are you Chico?

862
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,470
Are you Chico?

863
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,430
Chico?

864
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,530
No?

865
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:43,930
Okay.

866
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,050
He's shaking his head.

867
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,530
Are you Chico?

868
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,130
I know where he is.

869
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,890
Are you Chico?

870
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,580
Oh, he's counting.

871
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,360
He's trying to stay sane.

872
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,020
I don't think that's Chico.

873
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:09,880
Oh.

874
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,380
Oh.

875
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,920
We like to play the special piece.

876
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,080
Are you Chico?

877
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:21,910
Anyway.

878
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,950
You must be Ames.

879
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,770
The jump in tone from Peace Walker to this game is always wild to me.

880
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,110
It's like if the Dark Knight took place right after Adam West.

881
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,590
I know!

882
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:33,610
Oh.

883
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:34,950
Here we go.

884
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,070
Chico.

885
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,210
Chico.

886
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,110
Chico.

887
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,510
Chico.

888
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:40,650
Chico.

889
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,010
Look me in the eyes.

890
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,450
Chico.

891
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,790
It is true though.

892
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,810
The tone of whiplash is absolutely insane.

893
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:55,990
Sorry, everybody else.

894
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,210
Chico.

895
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,490
Chico, it's me.

896
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:03,650
Hey.

897
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,270
Go away!

898
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,910
Go away!

899
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,290
Hey!

900
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:07,470
Shh!

901
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:07,650
Shh!

902
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,430
Everybody shut up!

903
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:08,790
Shh!

904
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:09,690
Everybody, shh!

905
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,310
Get off!

906
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,410
Chico, keep it down.

907
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,330
Go away!

908
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,290
Tranquilize him!

909
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:14,750
Right over here.

910
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,050
Hey.

911
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,450
Hey, you gotta let me out.

912
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,310
Hey!

913
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:17,830
Hey!

914
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:18,750
Hey!

915
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,430
Oh, I'm not gonna take any of you guys if you don't... Shut up!

916
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,390
Knock him out.

917
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,230
Punch him in the face.

918
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,130
Oh.

919
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,050
Choke him.

920
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,530
Chico, calm down.

921
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,210
I don't think that's gonna help him calm down.

922
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,190
Calm down.

923
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,830
Shh.

924
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,150
Eternal rest.

925
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,830
Aww, little Chico.

926
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,390
Little baby boy.

927
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,550
Did they just give off or something?

928
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,950
Not here.

929
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,330
Are you sure?

930
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,610
Pretty sure.

931
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,530
Is Chico able to walk?

932
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:10,730
Uh...

933
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,850
He might have been before.

934
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:19,270
Lambda.

935
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,290
Chico!

936
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:28,450
Hi.

937
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,080
Alright.

938
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,380
We got Chico.

939
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,540
Sorry, everybody else.

940
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,060
So sorry.

941
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,380
Sorry, everybody else.

942
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:51,840
Sorry.

943
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,120
So sorry.

944
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,480
I saved you before in another timeline.

945
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:55,820
Trust.

946
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,920
I saved you before in another timeline.

947
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,580
Believe me.

948
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,300
Okay.

949
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,080
Chico?

950
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,200
Stop coughing.

951
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:04,280
Why?

952
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,960
Chico, shh.

953
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,380
Chico, I need you to shut up, please.

954
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,800
Chico, stop.

955
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,860
Stop making noise.

956
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,400
Alright.

957
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,880
You got a friend, huh?

958
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,180
Wait.

959
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,100
Let's reload.

960
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,280
No, wait.

961
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,620
Oh, he...

962
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,000
They're like staring straight at each other.

963
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,080
Hmm.

964
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,960
Okay, hold on.

965
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,640
Now I can do this.

966
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,340
Maybe.

967
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,720
That was not good.

968
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:34,640
Hahaha.

969
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:35,860
Stop.

970
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,580
There we go.

971
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:38,920
Alright.

972
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,500
Chico, come on.

973
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,420
We're going to the rendezvous point.

974
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,460
Which is all the way down there.

975
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,640
Okay.

976
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,020
Okay, buddy.

977
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,360
Alright.

978
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:53,580
What?

979
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,820
What you don't end up head first in the ocean.

980
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,400
Oops.

981
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:58,940
Sorry, Chico.

982
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,300
No.

983
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,700
You can now either interrogate him, knock him out, or kill him.

984
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,720
His life is in your hands.

985
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,780
Look at some ammo.

986
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,380
Thank you.

987
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,310
Feed him to the fishes?

988
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:26,250
Yeah.

989
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,230
You're going to the fishes.

990
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,090
There's a guy up there, so we gotta be a little bit careful.

991
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:35,950
You're going to the fishes!

992
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,170
Watch this, Chico.

993
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:38,750
Hahaha.

994
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,610
Watch this.

995
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,090
Hahaha.

996
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:43,490
Watch that.

997
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,130
Did you like it?

998
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:45,290
Chico.

999
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,670
Chico, this will be you one day.

1000
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,470
Well, no.

1001
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,330
Like, you will be the one throwing them in one day.

1002
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,190
You'll take after me.

1003
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:54,190
Look, Chico.

1004
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:54,910
Watch and learn.

1005
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,410
Watch and learn.

1006
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,430
It doesn't count as a kill.

1007
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,390
I don't know, actually, if it counts as a kill or not.

1008
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,750
I...

1009
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,230
It's not my fault if they don't know how to swim.

1010
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:03,670
Okay?

1011
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,110
It's not my fault if they don't know how to swim.

1012
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,570
Hit some ammo here.

1013
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:11,610
Never mind.

1014
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,050
Just kidding.

1015
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:13,510
Okay.

1016
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:14,230
Never mind.

1017
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:15,070
Never mind.

1018
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,410
Let's go!

1019
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,950
Yeah, that one hit the rocks a little bit.

1020
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,130
It was a bit of a...

1021
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:22,630
Rocky.

1022
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:23,750
Way down.

1023
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,410
If gravity killed them, then you're innocent.

1024
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,170
Yeah!

1025
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,580
Return Chico to the sea.

1026
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,820
What about pause?

1027
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:47,980
What?

1028
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,400
What are you saying?

1029
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,610
Don't resist.

1030
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,050
Don't resist, buddy.

1031
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,810
I'm gonna put you in the cave.

1032
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:09,870
Chico...

1033
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,850
I'm so sorry.

1034
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,350
Great.

1035
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,650
You reached the RV.

1036
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,710
Put the target down for a minute.

1037
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:15,770
How's he doing?

1038
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,530
Chico, where's Paz?

1039
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,730
Just like Chico.

1040
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:23,910
Too...

1041
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:24,350
Too real.

1042
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,570
The sick tunes.

1043
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,400
Why are you just listening to that?

1044
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,620
She's dead.

1045
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,580
I don't understand why he's listening to it, though.

1046
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,470
Keeper better than Snake is a joke.

1047
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:01,330
Okay, now use your eye droid to call the chopper for pick-up.

1048
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:02,990
Um...

1049
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,770
I'm gonna wait on that real quick.

1050
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,310
Instead...

1051
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,470
Chico's tape.

1052
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,010
Wait...

1053
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,430
Which one is it?

1054
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,510
What's the one we just got?

1055
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,250
Oh my god, there's so many pause reports.

1056
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,530
Holy cow!

1057
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:27,850
It was three?

1058
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:28,630
Thank ya.

1059
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,670
Oh, oh yeah!

1060
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,540
This isn't Duran Duran.

1061
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,660
Yeah, we can probably listen to the Paz tapes later.

1062
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,640
Chico was taken out of his cage.

1063
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,580
Did he leave the tape recording while he was being moved?

1064
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,260
Hmm...

1065
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,560
Paz might be up ahead.

1066
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:06,040
I don't typically like listening to the tapes while I'm playing because it distracts me, but...

1067
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,000
Vehicles.

1068
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,360
How astute.

1069
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,540
Astute observation.

1070
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,400
Kazuhiro Miller.

1071
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,100
Is that...

1072
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,840
A helicopter.

1073
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,700
Of some...

1074
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,320
Another vehicle.

1075
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,860
Must be near the heliport.

1076
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,360
Okay.

1077
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,700
I don't think Paz is dead.

1078
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,440
Is it from Japan?

1079
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,340
A gate.

1080
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,620
A gate.

1081
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,680
Well, lucky for them, I know exactly where she's at.

1082
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,520
Pretty high quality recording for a portable recorder in 1974.

1083
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,260
Look.

1084
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,340
Things were just built different in that era, you know?

1085
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,030
I wish I could get more ammo.

1086
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,150
I might have to start being lethal.

1087
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:07,370
Hehehehe.

1088
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,190
What was it?

1089
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,450
Chico left the tape on record while he was being moved.

1090
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,910
Try using what you hear to find Paz.

1091
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,990
If you're still not sure, listen to the tape again.

1092
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,770
Listen to the whole tapes after this boss.

1093
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,290
I...I don't want to listen to them while I'm playing.

1094
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,370
Cause like I said, it distracts me.

1095
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,530
But I...

1096
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,870
Will listen to some of them at least.

1097
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,130
Oh, hello mister.

1098
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:34,570
Oh, he's sick.

1099
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,490
Oh shit.

1100
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:38,490
Oh no.

1101
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,010
Oh no.

1102
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,370
I did not see that guy there.

1103
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:43,930
Oh no.

1104
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,430
Whew.

1105
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,660
That was close.

1106
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,040
Whew.

1107
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,200
That was close.

1108
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,980
Holy cow.

1109
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,780
My bad.

1110
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,680
Um...

1111
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,900
I can just hide you right here.

1112
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:05,740
I guess.

1113
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,100
Nice save, thank you.

1114
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,060
Golly.

1115
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,860
Okay, they're just having like a little...

1116
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,920
Special bonding moment together.

1117
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,560
Nobody up there, it seems.

1118
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,540
Okay, now here's the part of the game that...

1119
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,120
Well, no, we're not quite there yet.

1120
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,020
The part I'm not very good at is coming up.

1121
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:34,940
Okay.

1122
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,420
Yeah.

1123
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,540
Next they headed for a place with a helicopter.

1124
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,180
Yeah.

1125
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,180
Yeah.

1126
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,150
I see that guy by the way.

1127
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:53,990
I see him.

1128
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,190
Hello.

1129
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,410
He's like looking right at me.

1130
00:51:59,450 --> 00:51:59,950
Oh.

1131
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,050
He looks so wistful.

1132
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:02,450
Oh.

1133
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:04,310
Bless you!

1134
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,190
He looks so...

1135
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,630
Okay.

1136
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,290
Is anybody in here?

1137
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,370
Uh oh.

1138
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:21,530
Uh oh.

1139
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,150
Please no.

1140
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:24,270
What?

1141
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:24,890
You!

1142
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:26,490
I know!

1143
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,600
Oh my god.

1144
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,240
He sees me so easily.

1145
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,180
You heard me say bless you.

1146
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:39,600
Yeah.

1147
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,040
I'm just trying to be polite.

1148
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,620
It's fine.

1149
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,600
We got his ass.

1150
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,380
Who else is around you?

1151
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,360
There's a security camera like right over there.

1152
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,700
Oh, you can hear it.

1153
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,820
You hear it?

1154
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,780
Hehehe.

1155
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:08,980
Uh, oop.

1156
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,280
I see you.

1157
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,520
Oh, I see you.

1158
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,100
Okay.

1159
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,020
Surveillance camera.

1160
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,760
Okay.

1161
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,640
I mean...

1162
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,600
There's only like 40 guys on this base.

1163
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,180
We could just kill them all.

1164
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,160
No?

1165
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,760
Look, I'm putting...

1166
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:35,860
Look, I'm putting...

1167
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,080
Oh, whoops.

1168
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,560
I'm putting you out of the rain.

1169
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,420
So that, you know, you...

1170
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:44,880
Are...

1171
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,840
You don't get sick.

1172
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,980
I'm actually quite considerate, no?

1173
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,380
Hehehehe.

1174
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,640
I'm quite considerate.

1175
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,640
I'd say.

1176
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:53,780
Okay.

1177
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,680
How do we...

1178
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,560
Um, go around these guys?

1179
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,380
That's a good question.

1180
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,340
What?

1181
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,000
It's also stealth that there's no witnesses.

1182
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,000
Hehehehe.

1183
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:06,600
Yeah.

1184
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,580
This guy might be kinda risky.

1185
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:11,940
But...

1186
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,480
We'll still try for it.

1187
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,720
I don't think he turns around.

1188
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,760
Does he?

1189
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,250
Everybody?

1190
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,170
Everybody's sick here.

1191
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,230
It's because you forced them outside in the rain.

1192
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,570
So nice of you.

1193
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:30,610
That's why you're the best boss.

1194
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,910
I would do the same for you guys, you know?

1195
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,430
The surveillance camera.

1196
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:38,770
Oh.

1197
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,030
There's a guy right there too.

1198
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:42,310
Goodnight.

1199
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,350
I don't wanna grab him.

1200
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:54,750
No.

1201
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,270
Oh, there.

1202
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:00,690
Hehehehe.

1203
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:02,970
He said it.

1204
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,930
Oh, he got some grenades.

1205
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,150
Oh, that's the rocket launcher.

1206
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:12,130
Okay, never mind.

1207
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:12,530
And everything.

1208
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,070
Why isn't the camera picking up the guy collapse?

1209
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,210
Don't worry about it.

1210
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,650
Would you also force us in the rain?

1211
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:21,470
Um...

1212
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:27,730
I mean, actually, you can come over here.

1213
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:31,290
No?

1214
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,330
You're not gonna do that?

1215
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,590
He's just like...

1216
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,950
I think I saw something weird.

1217
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:37,230
He's like...

1218
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:37,470
I'm...

1219
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,830
This is above my pay grid.

1220
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,310
To investigate.

1221
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:42,150
Honestly.

1222
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,050
I'm gonna go through here.

1223
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,070
I know.

1224
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,510
You might be able to crawl in there.

1225
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,110
You might be able to crawl in there.

1226
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:55,370
Thanks in advance for dragging us to a dry place after you shoot us.

1227
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,710
Yeah, of course.

1228
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:57,090
Yeah, of course.

1229
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,630
Look at the little rat.

1230
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:05,730
Bless you.

1231
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,180
I hate doing the cover attack because it uses too many of my fingers.

1232
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,900
I wonder if I could get him without the other guy noticing.

1233
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,420
You know?

1234
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,020
That's one thing.

1235
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,820
That's...

1236
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,940
I could drag him.

1237
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,180
Get more fingers.

1238
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,060
True.

1239
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,400
Never mind.

1240
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,380
I don't need to get him at all.

1241
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,120
That's the admin building.

1242
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,540
Watch your corners.

1243
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,500
Okay.

1244
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,820
Thanks, guys.

1245
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,690
I don't remember who's around in here.

1246
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,950
I hear another surveillance.

1247
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:06,810
Wait, who?

1248
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:08,110
What?

1249
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,250
No way.

1250
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,710
That guy saw me through the door.

1251
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:12,750
I hate this game.

1252
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,330
I hate this game.

1253
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,030
Is he still seeing me?

1254
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,170
Yes, he is.

1255
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,290
This guy sucks.

1256
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:27,590
No way.

1257
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:28,890
No way!

1258
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:30,430
Oh, never mind.

1259
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:30,950
He doesn't see.

1260
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,610
What are you doing?

1261
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:35,650
Oh, he went inside.

1262
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:37,170
What is...

1263
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:37,750
What is he doing?

1264
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,110
What's my gun doing?

1265
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:41,910
What's going on?

1266
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:51,490
Oh, my gun is jorking it.

1267
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:52,610
For real.

1268
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,650
Okay, he's leaving, good.

1269
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,390
I got it.

1270
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:02,730
Okay.

1271
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,670
As soon as I shoot this surveillance...

1272
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:06,090
Actually, do I need to?

1273
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,190
Is there another guy over there?

1274
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:08,650
Or...

1275
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,350
I might not need to.

1276
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,290
Is there someone up here?

1277
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:13,770
No?

1278
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:15,070
Uh-oh.

1279
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,250
Uh-oh.

1280
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,170
CP, this is Zula 2.

1281
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:18,730
Zula 2.

1282
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:20,650
Oh, no.

1283
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:33,750
Oh, no.

1284
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,290
Go, go, go!

1285
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,330
Even in ground, there must be wary of doorknobs.

1286
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,200
Holy cow, that scared me.

1287
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:43,780
Whoa!

1288
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,060
That guy freaked me out.

1289
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,280
Oh, there's two of them!

1290
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,240
No contact.

1291
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:04,880
No contact.

1292
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:05,500
Yep.

1293
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,060
Oh, come on.

1294
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:12,940
There we go.

1295
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,040
No contact?

1296
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,970
What are you talking about contact?

1297
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,030
Excellent save, boss.

1298
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:29,670
Thank you.

1299
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,930
I don't know if there's anybody in here or not.

1300
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,170
Wait.

1301
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,370
Do I see feet?

1302
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,630
Doesn't seem like anybody.

1303
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:52,430
What's that?

1304
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,920
What's that?

1305
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,480
These other guards collapse unconscious and a shadowy figure crawling around.

1306
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:10,920
Nope.

1307
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,260
Way above my pay grade.

1308
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,530
She looks so bad.

1309
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:22,750
Oh, my God.

1310
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,070
There's a dog barking outside.

1311
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:24,810
He's so loud.

1312
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:26,610
Buzz!

1313
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,400
Oh, my gosh.

1314
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,420
Her luscious locks.

1315
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:34,980
I know.

1316
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,680
Oh, sweet baby girl.

1317
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,260
Oh, my gosh.

1318
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,280
I never realized that I played...

1319
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,400
Maybe I just forgot that it plays...

1320
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,540
Love the turrets there.

1321
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,070
Okay.

1322
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,030
Come on.

1323
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:06,790
Yes.

1324
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,790
I don't remember if...

1325
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:15,470
New guys come, or if these guys were the guys...

1326
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:15,750
Oh.

1327
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:16,190
Uh-oh.

1328
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:17,150
Uh-oh.

1329
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,950
Uh-oh.

1330
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,030
Uh-oh.

1331
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:22,650
No, no, no, no.

1332
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:23,710
Uh...

1333
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:24,250
Oh, shit!

1334
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,130
I did the wrong thing.

1335
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,050
Uh...

1336
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:26,530
Nope, nope.

1337
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:39,810
Um...

1338
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,330
This is the part I'm bad at.

1339
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:41,950
Spit it out.

1340
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:42,510
Oh, God!

1341
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:43,110
There's more coming!

1342
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:46,270
Ah, there's more coming!

1343
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:48,550
There's more coming!

1344
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:49,710
There's more coming!

1345
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:51,650
Oh, uh...

1346
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:52,790
Uh, you know what?

1347
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:53,790
Shoot to kill.

1348
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:54,310
Shoot to kill.

1349
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:54,750
Shoot to kill.

1350
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:55,210
Shoot to kill.

1351
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:55,810
Shoot to kill.

1352
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,410
These guys suck, anyway.

1353
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:04,990
Shoot to kill.

1354
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:05,410
Shoot to kill.

1355
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:05,850
Shoot to kill.

1356
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:07,850
Okay.

1357
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:11,890
Come on, Pies.

1358
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:15,950
Sorry.

1359
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:16,930
No, a minus two.

1360
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,350
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

1361
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,490
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

1362
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:21,530
Everything's fine.

1363
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,770
It's okay, we'll get you some Pepto Bismol, girly.

1364
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:28,750
Oh.

1365
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,210
Uh... You know what?

1366
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:33,650
This might be a bad idea, but...

1367
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:37,550
No!

1368
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,090
No!

1369
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:43,130
I don't know who's closest.

1370
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:44,030
Nobody is.

1371
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:44,750
Nobody is.

1372
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:49,630
Oh, there's a guy there.

1373
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,100
Uh... Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1374
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,240
Actually, uh...

1375
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,780
Maybe I can...

1376
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,160
get him.

1377
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:07,720
Shoot!

1378
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,400
Got him.

1379
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,540
I love reaction time!

1380
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,080
Yeah!

1381
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,340
Okay, come on.

1382
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,480
I can't believe I missed the first one.

1383
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,600
Okay, let's keep going.

1384
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,500
I know some... Uh-oh.

1385
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,120
Uh-oh.

1386
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,880
Okay, this is where...

1387
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,600
Ah!

1388
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,120
Oh, golly.

1389
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,120
Oh, golly.

1390
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,100
Get and call the chopper.

1391
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,420
Keep an eye out for nearby enemies.

1392
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,240
They can try to shoot down the chopper.

1393
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,180
I'm gonna take her...

1394
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,060
Well, also, we gotta take her to...

1395
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,180
We gotta take her to, uh...

1396
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:44,640
Chico.

1397
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,480
Might be better to just run for it.

1398
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:49,860
Oh, gosh.

1399
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,320
No, I thought you were gonna keep running!

1400
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,540
Why'd you stop?

1401
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,500
Why'd you stop?

1402
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,240
No!

1403
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:58,600
Uh-oh.

1404
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:58,760
Uh-oh.

1405
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,500
He's definitely gonna see me.

1406
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,020
Okay, hold on.

1407
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,460
Maybe I can get him.

1408
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:04,820
Okay.

1409
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,100
Oh, there's another guy right there!

1410
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:08,460
No!

1411
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,600
Happy birthday!

1412
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,420
Oh, my gosh.

1413
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:12,120
Oh, no.

1414
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:12,620
I need to...

1415
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:13,160
I need to pay attention.

1416
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:13,460
Sorry.

1417
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:14,220
Happy birthday!

1418
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,380
Oh, shoot.

1419
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,360
I need to get this guy.

1420
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,780
It's about to start being lethal time soon.

1421
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:22,880
Right.

1422
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,720
Oh, my God.

1423
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,040
Where are all these guys coming from?

1424
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:26,860
Ah!

1425
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:27,980
Ah!

1426
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:29,220
Ah!

1427
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:29,360
Ah!

1428
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,280
Uh, this might be where we...

1429
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:34,940
Die, everybody.

1430
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:36,020
Ah!

1431
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:36,460
No!

1432
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:37,480
Ah!

1433
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:37,980
Don't die!

1434
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:38,680
Ah!

1435
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,160
Don't die!

1436
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:40,580
Oh,

1437
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,120
this is the part that I get all scared at.

1438
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,000
It's okay.

1439
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,480
The checkpoint was right here, so...

1440
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,120
Go ahead and call the chopper.

1441
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,460
Keep an eye out for nearby enemies.

1442
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,300
They can try to shoot down the chopper.

1443
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,240
You!

1444
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,100
You son of a gun!

1445
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:06,540
You!

1446
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:07,960
Oh, wait.

1447
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,540
I just realized the, uh...

1448
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:10,480
What's it called is...

1449
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,460
Is active.

1450
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,560
You see that tank right there?

1451
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:13,800
Oops.

1452
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,120
Oops.

1453
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,620
I know I got him, but I kinda want him to go down.

1454
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:23,480
Um...

1455
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,120
We don't want the tank to, like...

1456
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,080
To wake up.

1457
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,320
At us, you know?

1458
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,760
We don't want the tank to, like, shoot at us.

1459
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,620
That would be, like, so bad.

1460
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,640
Or we don't want the spotlight to see us.

1461
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,340
Oh my god.

1462
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,160
That guy sees us.

1463
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,940
Oh, I think he just fell asleep.

1464
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,280
Perfect.

1465
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,100
We're just gonna do a little sprint.

1466
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,460
A little sprint.

1467
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:53,800
And...

1468
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,600
So far, so good.

1469
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,120
There's a guy right there, but I think we're okay.

1470
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,500
Uh, I think, actually, we're okay.

1471
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,680
We're gonna sprint?

1472
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,640
We're gonna sprint?

1473
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,460
We're gonna go?

1474
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,240
Come on, Jake.

1475
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,020
Come on.

1476
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,220
What do you mean?

1477
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:05,520
Ah!

1478
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:06,800
Oh, shoot.

1479
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:07,960
Oh.

1480
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,640
Oh, shit.

1481
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,440
Wait, wait.

1482
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,660
No, shoot.

1483
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,340
Shoot, please.

1484
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,360
Shoot.

1485
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,140
Oh my god.

1486
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:22,410
Ah!

1487
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:23,190
Ah!

1488
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,930
Where did you come from?

1489
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,370
Oh my god, where did you guys come from?

1490
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,280
Where?

1491
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:34,760
Where?

1492
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,560
Oh, shoot, where?

1493
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,320
Wait, where?

1494
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:36,980
Where?

1495
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:37,700
From when?

1496
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,860
From where?

1497
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:39,640
From where?

1498
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:39,700
Where?

1499
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,380
Wait, actually, where?

1500
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,520
Oh my god.

1501
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,120
Ah!

1502
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:45,800
Ah!

1503
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,480
The tank!

1504
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:47,760
Ah!

1505
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,060
Boss!

1506
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,660
I'm sorry!

1507
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:04,690
Sorry.

1508
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:05,310
Don't yell.

1509
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,650
You think she's okay up there?

1510
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,700
What are they firing at?

1511
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,780
It's not her, right?

1512
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,600
Oh.

1513
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:24,560
Oh.

1514
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:24,620
Contact?

1515
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:26,160
Where?

1516
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,140
Oh, oh shit.

1517
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:27,920
Ah!

1518
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:32,740
Don't yell!

1519
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:35,820
No, you come over here.

1520
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,880
You come over here!

1521
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:39,800
Get out of there.

1522
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,400
Get out of there.

1523
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,300
That guy is just walking.

1524
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,250
No, you're okay!

1525
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:50,750
No, you're okay!

1526
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:51,890
You might not be okay.

1527
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:58,950
Can they see me?

1528
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:01,610
Death 2?

1529
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:03,270
CP, this is Zulu 6.

1530
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,610
Hostel gun out of sight.

1531
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:06,030
Searching now.

1532
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:06,550
Over.

1533
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,310
This is CP.

1534
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:08,830
Understood.

1535
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,090
Search every corner.

1536
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,830
They gotta be around here somewhere.

1537
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,310
Out.

1538
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:13,230
Is he behind the rock?

1539
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,170
Oh, he must be.

1540
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,270
Oh, yeah.

1541
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,070
They're...

1542
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:19,500
Um...

1543
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:20,310
They'll...

1544
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:21,190
They'll leave eventually.

1545
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,210
No urgency.

1546
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,770
I know.

1547
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:31,550
Oh my god.

1548
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:32,090
There's still...

1549
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,750
There's still...

1550
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,170
There's that guy.

1551
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:33,990
I didn't even see him.

1552
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,030
Maybe I'll rush them.

1553
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:38,570
How did you see me?

1554
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,490
How did you see me?

1555
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:41,950
Chico?

1556
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,190
Chico?

1557
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:45,390
Uh...

1558
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:45,770
I'm sorry.

1559
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:50,470
It's not me.

1560
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:57,980
Ouch!

1561
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,120
Don't worry, Chico!

1562
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,440
Oh, that wasn't just for that one stinking guy!

1563
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:28,330
I didn't see him on my way to...

1564
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,750
Wait, where am I?

1565
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:32,790
Uh...

1566
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:39,810
No way!

1567
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,170
No way!

1568
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:45,390
Shut up.

1569
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:46,230
Whoops.

1570
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,650
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1571
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:49,810
Ma'am.

1572
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:54,870
Nice spawn.

1573
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,090
I didn't even realize...

1574
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:56,530
Oh my god.

1575
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,550
They won't see me, right?

1576
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:02,370
Drop down.

1577
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,020
They're gonna notice she's missing at some point.

1578
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,580
Oh boy.

1579
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:14,740
Ugh!

1580
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:15,980
Be gentle with her.

1581
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:16,860
There's no time!

1582
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,800
There's no time!

1583
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,540
See, pain is an illusion.

1584
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:23,660
Pain...

1585
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,440
Pain is in...

1586
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:25,900
Oh my god.

1587
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,520
Oh my god.

1588
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,060
We're so doomed.

1589
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,020
This is so...

1590
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:30,740
Shit!

1591
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,200
Why are there two cars?

1592
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,480
Is he gonna see me?

1593
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:37,740
No way.

1594
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,240
Where did this other car come from?!

1595
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,380
You son of a bitch!

1596
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,980
Oh my god, I can't see.

1597
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:48,800
Um...

1598
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:49,840
Please.

1599
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,820
I missed.

1600
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,180
Nooooo!

1601
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,160
Wait...

1602
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:08,980
Hostel!

1603
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,140
Stop it!

1604
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:18,820
Oh my god.

1605
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,980
I'm just making the most noise ever.

1606
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,260
Please, guy.

1607
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:28,800
Please.

1608
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:29,580
Please.

1609
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:30,880
There we go.

1610
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,610
I need to go before the...

1611
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,350
The car comes, you know?

1612
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,790
We need to go before the car comes.

1613
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:48,010
Alright.

1614
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,030
Now we'll put her in the bushes.

1615
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:50,990
Right here.

1616
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,990
And I'll get these guys.

1617
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:55,590
Hopefully.

1618
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:56,750
Hopefully.

1619
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:57,590
Oh my god.

1620
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:58,850
No stinking way.

1621
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:01,090
Oh my god.

1622
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:07,510
Okay.

1623
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,130
And...

1624
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,110
Round three.

1625
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,510
This is...

1626
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,250
This is fine.

1627
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,050
This is fine.

1628
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:17,630
This is fine.

1629
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:18,050
This guy is nothing.

1630
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:19,450
This guy is whatever.

1631
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,090
Who cares?

1632
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:24,880
Pull it...

1633
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:24,980
Oh.

1634
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:25,480
Wait.

1635
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,200
I think he's down.

1636
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:27,820
Okay!

1637
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,700
Everything's fine.

1638
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,300
Guys!

1639
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,200
I don't know even where that guy went.

1640
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,940
There's no one else over here, right?

1641
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,000
You're okay, Pies.

1642
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:49,980
You're okay, little baby.

1643
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,540
Great shot on the driver.

1644
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,140
Thank you!

1645
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:52,740
Oh!

1646
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,300
Oh my god!

1647
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,110
I was like, I think there's a guy down there.

1648
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:08,210
But I couldn't remember.

1649
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:08,330
The chopper.

1650
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:09,950
The chopper...

1651
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:16,570
The chopper...

1652
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,860
You're together!

1653
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:28,220
You remember each other?

1654
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,280
Oh, sorry.

1655
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,120
They're like kind of...

1656
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,100
Fused together at this moment.

1657
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,380
Like a freaky...

1658
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:35,480
Oh.

1659
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,360
Oh my god.

1660
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,240
Anyway, okay.

1661
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:41,680
Let's call the chopper.

1662
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:48,260
Did he just say sorry?

1663
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,300
Is he talking to her?

1664
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,580
Wait, she's humming.

1665
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,820
Love the turrets.

1666
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,220
That's so sad.

1667
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,860
That's so sad.

1668
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,800
I didn't know that she did that.

1669
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,800
Oh, my babies.

1670
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,000
Sorry, I keep walking on top of them.

1671
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,100
Sorry.

1672
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:31,300
Morpho.

1673
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,200
Thank you.

1674
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:35,660
Morpho.

1675
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,840
I didn't know she helped that.

1676
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:38,680
It's so sweet.

1677
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,680
All right.

1678
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,580
Who did I pick up?

1679
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:42,840
Chico, you're first.

1680
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,200
Yeah, P-Quad will be for next game.

1681
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,060
For obvious reasons.

1682
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,080
Oh, whoops.

1683
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:17,420
My bad.

1684
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,580
Me too.

1685
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:19,680
I want to go in.

1686
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,640
All right, get in.

1687
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:23,540
Time to go.

1688
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,240
Yay!

1689
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,830
Are you still upset with Poz before hearing your tapes?

1690
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:43,750
I was never upset with Poz.

1691
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:47,850
First try.

1692
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,510
I told you the second half would be kind of rough.

1693
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:51,970
But... We made it.

1694
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,730
We made it.

1695
01:15:58,650 --> 01:15:59,130
Oh.

1696
01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,710
Oh, boy.

1697
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:02,490
What do you think?

1698
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:02,710
Oh.

1699
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,150
I was gonna say, what do you think my red kiss?

1700
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,010
Then I turned my head.

1701
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:08,710
You could see it.

1702
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:13,710
Me for Poz.

1703
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:15,150
Me for Boo.

1704
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,070
Yeah, yeah.

1705
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,710
Two kill.

1706
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,330
Minus 400.

1707
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:20,330
I would have gotten...

1708
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,890
Three retrives.

1709
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:22,690
Okay.

1710
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:26,110
You guys ready for the cutscene that leads into five?

1711
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,330
Are you guys ready?

1712
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:32,690
I'm not ready.

1713
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:34,810
Me for Boomer.

1714
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:43,270
It's okay.

1715
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:46,270
Because after this, we'll play some silly missions and they're fun.

1716
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:06,660
I don't know how he picks him up.

1717
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,460
She's weak.

1718
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,240
Damn it, we were set up.

1719
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,480
We gotta get it out.

1720
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,880
She set her stomach.

1721
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,580
She set her stomach.

1722
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,520
We have to open her now.

1723
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,660
No time for our aesthetic.

1724
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,820
We gotta open her now.

1725
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,620
Hold her down.

1726
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,800
Hold her down!

1727
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:28,300
Oh.

1728
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,340
Oh.

1729
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,340
You have...

1730
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,440
Oh, wait.

1731
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,380
Ah, wait.

1732
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:34,780
Ah!

1733
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:35,700
Sorry.

1734
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,340
Ah!

1735
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:38,860
Oh.

1736
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,120
Ah, sorry.

1737
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,080
I forgot that there...

1738
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:42,420
Oh.

1739
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,380
So sorry.

1740
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:44,180
Oh.

1741
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:45,880
Ah!

1742
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,440
I'm Chico.

1743
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,100
I don't think I ever watched this part.

1744
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:57,960
Actually, myself.

1745
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,220
Protect us, Minto.

1746
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,980
I'm protecting your eyes, but not my eyes!

1747
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:05,800
Eww!

1748
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,380
Oh, God!

1749
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,320
AHHHH!

1750
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,600
Keep the gun in!

1751
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,970
Breathing stable.

1752
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,070
No action bleeding.

1753
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,690
Closing her up.

1754
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:11,730
She's clean!

1755
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,530
It's gotta be a continuous shoot.

1756
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,620
A call.

1757
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:24,640
Close, can you hear me?

1758
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,860
What's up, Huey?

1759
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,580
Our guests are right on time.

1760
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,080
Document destruction and hangar decontamination are complete.

1761
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,980
AFVs have been stowed away.

1762
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,460
And Zeke's on the sea floor, along with the nuke.

1763
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:37,960
Everyone's got their story straight.

1764
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,280
The guided tour is wrapped up by the time you get home.

1765
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:41,940
Sounds good.

1766
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,480
Make me proud.

1767
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,020
Make me proud.

1768
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:48,620
I believe I'll have the IAEA praising us as the poster boys for world peace.

1769
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:49,580
Out.

1770
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:50,880
What?

1771
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,040
Guys, I...

1772
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,440
Stinky farts?

1773
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,020
My cat?

1774
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:54,900
My cat?

1775
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:00,120
Yeah, she just had a bit of explosive indigestion.

1776
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,720
Tower, this is Morpho 1.

1777
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,200
I winked, but you couldn't tell.

1778
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,080
Can't get through.

1779
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,300
The lake seems fine, but...

1780
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,120
Oh my gosh, wait.

1781
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,040
It's really cloudy today.

1782
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,180
Oh!

1783
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,680
MSF?

1784
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,920
MSF?

1785
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,280
Look

1786
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,070
at, they're out there fighting!

1787
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:55,130
Guys!

1788
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:12,370
Watch out, Chico!

1789
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,810
Save, Leech!

1790
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,560
Oh

1791
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:41,890
my god.

1792
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,650
I'm here.

1793
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:47,350
Another?

1794
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,490
The White Snake.

1795
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:54,290
Yeah, get his ass.

1796
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,470
Please.

1797
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,310
Guys.

1798
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,060
Oh my god.

1799
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,360
My whole face.

1800
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,060
Oh, it hurts.

1801
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:25,620
It hurts.

1802
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,060
It hurts.

1803
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,500
Snake's like, no, my man.

1804
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,420
Everything.

1805
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:09,330
Everything gone.

1806
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:14,690
Everything's gone.

1807
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:22,550
My hours and peace walk are... gone.

1808
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:25,690
The inspection was nothing but a smoke screen.

1809
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,210
I heard explosions.

1810
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:32,970
They played us like a damn fiddle.

1811
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,610
Give it back.

1812
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:36,230
Sorry.

1813
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,070
This isn't right.

1814
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:37,890
That was ours.

1815
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:42,250
We built it, damn it.

1816
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,230
We did.

1817
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:48,110
Spying bitch.

1818
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:50,610
Come on.

1819
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:51,610
Come on.

1820
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:52,690
Start talking, bitch.

1821
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:53,790
Come on.

1822
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,150
Get up and start talking.

1823
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:57,170
Guys, calm down.

1824
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,030
Oh god.

1825
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:05,890
How does she have, like, the strength to move?

1826
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:06,010
Bob?

1827
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,030
She's leaving it all.

1828
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:12,690
Bob, there's...

1829
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:13,230
It's alright.

1830
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:13,990
We got it out.

1831
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,620
There's another...

1832
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:23,300
No!

1833
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,780
Can you make my...

1834
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:25,770
No!

1835
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:26,420
Can you make my...

1836
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:26,720
No!

1837
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:52,150
Oh my god.

1838
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:56,930
And then another... another helicopter right into ours.

1839
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:02,570
Smoke from the disaster was visible from the coastline.

1840
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,550
The media blamed money-minded private militias.

1841
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:11,390
And scandals followed when the US was fingered as one of... one of the organization's top clients.

1842
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:17,030
In response, the Secretary of Defense publicly stated that neither the US nor its allies had any hand.

1843
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:21,090
Reports also suggested that... I-A-E-A.

1844
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:23,750
English inspectors visited the site.

1845
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:28,750
However, the UN and the IAEA instead no such inspection took place.

1846
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:29,810
Oh gosh, sorry.

1847
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:32,230
The casualty figure is uncertain.

1848
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:33,670
There are no known survivors.

1849
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:38,610
However, in the moments prior to and following the incident, several unidentified military cops were sighted in the area.

1850
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:43,290
I-E-I-A-E-I...

1851
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:47,170
XD You're favorite song.

1852
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:59,210
Nicola, Barth, immigrants wrongly executed, but their deaths served as a message to others.

1853
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:03,410
That ours is a society that murders the innocent.

1854
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:11,100
Do you, too, believe your sacrifice will change the world?

1855
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,210
Ah, you're right, Jordan.

1856
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:22,570
Ugh.

1857
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,630
Yeah, PeaceWalker.

1858
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:29,230
That's why I'm just like, you can't play this game in V without, like, PeaceWalker.

1859
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:32,430
Because you just don't feel... You don't feel it!

1860
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:33,710
You don't feel that pain.

1861
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,740
Ugh.

1862
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,420
Don't work!

1863
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,040
Ugh.

1864
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,360
The loss.

1865
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,100
It hurts so bad!

1866
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,080
Oh, it hurts!

1867
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:54,460
Ugh!

1868
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,320
Everything you built up!

1869
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,300
All those men you captured!

1870
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:05,240
Everybody that you... You read their little bios and you become accustomed and... And... And...

1871
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,620
Uh... And... You grow close.

1872
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,340
You just want their little... You just look at their little faces and you're like, That's my team!

1873
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,480
That's MSF!

1874
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,600
Their little personalities!

1875
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:24,400
All of them gone!

1876
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,560
Oh, my man!

1877
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,860
I love them so much!

1878
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,800
The moment is yours.

1879
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,120
The agony is your triumph.

1880
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,320
Here's to you, Nicola and Mark.

1881
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,400
The last and final moment is yours.

1882
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:56,520
The last and final moment is yours.

1883
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:59,960
The agony is your triumph.

1884
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,060
Here's to you, I love them all.

1885
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,420
Are you sure those were your men?

1886
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,520
I didn't see anyone running around in T-shirts.

1887
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,340
Oh, my God!

1888
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,200
They were all gone!

1889
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:10,920
They were all gone!

1890
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:10,940
Ugh!

1891
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,740
Me coming into this part of the stream makes me feel like that one guy with the pieces.

1892
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,440
Ugh!

1893
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:25,980
So...

1894
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,720
That's, like, the intro into V.

1895
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,960
I think there's a little bit after the credits, no?

1896
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,120
I mean, there usually is.

1897
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:36,220
They played us like a damn fiddle!

1898
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:43,440
Oh, my gosh, Akira, you said that at the same time that I was just thinking it.

1899
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,660
But, uh...

1900
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,660
Yeah, that's the intro to V.

1901
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:54,880
Leech.

1902
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,200
And, um...

1903
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:57,760
But...

1904
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,980
We're gonna do some of the side...

1905
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,560
Um, extra...

1906
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,920
The side-offs are...

1907
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,020
More fun.

1908
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,160
So...

1909
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,940
Um...

1910
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:08,520
You know...

1911
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,120
We just watched Paws explode...

1912
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:14,440
And everything fall apart in front of us.

1913
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:17,480
But now we can play as silly things!

1914
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,120
Uh...

1915
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,320
Possible watch the V trailers.

1916
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,660
Mm...

1917
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:36,880
Why?

1918
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,400
Uh...

1919
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:50,120
Been trying to play the games as you play them since I never had the opportunity before after gaming with the Unpeace Walker.

1920
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,340
I played through Ground Zeroes for the first time yesterday.

1921
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,480
Yeah... It sucks.

1922
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,720
They were good trailers.

1923
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:08,140
Yeah, but I want to get through the missions before we do anything else.

1924
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,860
Meanwhile, myself, Big Mac, Brooks, and Mobius are on co-op mission.

1925
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,420
Zoological guard.

1926
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,760
Animal coordinator.

1927
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,460
Animal trainer.

1928
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:24,440
Motion actor?

1929
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,480
Blue rats motion actor.

1930
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:37,480
But, um... Yeah, this is basically how... How... V plays, but with like some...

1931
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,700
Some... A little bit of... A little bit of upgrades.

1932
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,600
It's pretty much the same.

1933
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:44,580
The rat actors.

1934
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,720
Rat vocal beat.

1935
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,140
Yeah, very slight differences.

1936
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,740
Why does she keep calling it V instead of 5?

1937
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:02,400
Because it's technically V.

1938
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,420
It's either way, but like...

1939
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:06,740
It's supposed to be...

1940
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,860
The, the, um, the, um, actually term is V.

1941
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:16,700
But

1942
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:22,420
yeah...

1943
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:24,320
If you want to, um, actually people.

1944
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,160
V has come too.

1945
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,100
I don't know why... It annoys you though.

1946
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,460
Now imagine waiting for V after this came out.

1947
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:38,960
Right!

1948
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:42,920
Right!

1949
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:45,620
Actually...

1950
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:47,580
Actually...

1951
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,040
Like a year?

1952
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:01,800
Maybe?

1953
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:02,280
I

1954
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,200
need to replay MGS3 remake.

1955
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:18,260
I want to see how... Well, I played a little bit of it, but...

1956
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,980
How would you feel about a spiritual successor?

1957
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,520
But in a fantasy world?

1958
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:26,620
Like play...

1959
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,900
Play... Wait, huh?

1960
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:32,400
I want to see if people are interested before spending my GMP.

1961
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:36,660
Enchanted lanterns for cameras.

1962
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,380
Like play...

1963
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:38,860
Like...

1964
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:41,540
I mean, I think any game that plays like...

1965
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,660
This one would be fun.

1966
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,880
None of that was my fault.

1967
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:49,460
Leech!

1968
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,020
I never blamed you!

1969
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,760
I never blamed you!

1970
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,800
Our buddy just accidentally pushed the...

1971
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:01,920
The self destruct button that is on the base, you know?

1972
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:02,940
Oh my god.

1973
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,540
The longest credits ever.

1974
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,920
Hideo Kojima.

1975
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:34,230
Oh my god.

1976
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:40,010
The longest credits ever.

1977
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:50,890
You can hear it, right?

1978
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:51,470
Yeah.

1979
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,590
I've never known choice.

1980
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:57,310
Where I was born.

1981
01:33:57,570 --> 01:33:58,950
The language I speak.

1982
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:00,450
Oh boy.

1983
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,890
I've never had the freedom to choose for myself.

1984
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:05,190
But you, right now.

1985
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:06,550
Learn a new language, buddy.

1986
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:07,230
It's free.

1987
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:09,110
Do as you will.

1988
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:10,070
Duolingo.

1989
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:10,850
I don't know.

1990
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:11,670
It's just...

1991
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:13,410
This will save...

1992
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,810
Big boss.

1993
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:15,830
This guy is such a loser.

1994
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:16,630
It may.

1995
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:17,410
He really is.

1996
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:18,330
Will you...

1997
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:20,590
Really kill...

1998
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,370
Zero for me?

1999
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:24,290
Not for you.

2000
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,730
Not for honor.

2001
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,090
Alright.

2002
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:31,130
Hush.

2003
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:33,730
Zero is...

2004
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:40,310
Oh boy.

2005
01:34:40,630 --> 01:34:40,730
Okay.

2006
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:41,890
I'm...

2007
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:42,490
Uh...

2008
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:43,290
I can't...

2009
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:44,410
Uh...

2010
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:44,550
Oh!

2011
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:45,510
1976.

2012
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,790
The Les Enfantes Hubles.

2013
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:48,130
Project is abandoned.

2014
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:50,750
Uh...

2015
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:52,150
Oh, there's so much text.

2016
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:52,910
I give up.

2017
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,070
I give up.

2018
01:34:57,550 --> 01:34:58,430
Oh my god!

2019
01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:02,070
Dr. Huey Emmerich's first child is born.

2020
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,290
His name is Hal.

2021
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:05,230
Wee.

2022
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:06,670
Mucho texto.

2023
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:08,510
Skippa!

2024
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:08,990
Skippa!

2025
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:12,650
Skippa!

2026
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:13,130
Skippa!

2027
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:14,730
Skippa!

2028
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:21,400
To be continued in the Phantompane!

2029
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:24,870
Phantompane!

2030
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:36,210
But, this is not the end of the stream.

2031
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:38,810
So, we got more to play.

2032
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:46,210
Boss!

2033
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:46,770
Boss!

2034
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:04,100
I mean, oh my god!

2035
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:11,100
I mean, he took a huge hit of the bomb.

2036
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,360
He was right there.

2037
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,240
Deceived.

2038
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,200
And left for dead.

2039
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,360
Visage?

2040
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,260
Is this...

2041
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:27,160
Visage?

2042
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,100
Deprived of all but pain.

2043
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,960
He's gonna say it.

2044
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,000
He's gonna say it.

2045
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,040
I'm afraid it's been...

2046
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,040
Nine years.

2047
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,060
Only one thing remains.

2048
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,620
Just to suffer!

2049
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:04,770
Retribution!

2050
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:06,990
Diamond dogs!

2051
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,610
Shoot the children!

2052
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:09,690
Oh my god.

2053
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:13,610
I can't take it seriously.

2054
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:14,850
Me neither.

2055
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:17,170
Why are we here?

2056
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:18,410
Just to suffer.

2057
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:20,550
Yeah, that's a Metal Gear reference.

2058
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:21,030
Yeah!

2059
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:32,930
Oh, that's my controller.

2060
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:33,310
Sorry.

2061
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:35,370
Wait, let me reconnect it.

2062
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,530
The children had it coming.

2063
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:40,330
No spoilers!

2064
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:42,350
It's literally in the trailer.

2065
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:44,770
It's literally in the trailer.

2066
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:45,890
That is actually in the trailer.

2067
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:46,850
That is not a spoiler.

2068
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:58,570
Sorry, I swallowed my T-Rog.

2069
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:03,650
You guys wanna hear something so sad after that too?

2070
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:08,370
That was the OG Vine meme?

2071
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:08,930
Actually, is it this one?

2072
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:10,330
Yeah.

2073
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,430
That was the OG Vine meme?

2074
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:21,370
Was it a Vine meme?

2075
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:32,940
It's so sad.

2076
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:37,340
Love the torrents.

2077
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:38,960
F them kids.

2078
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,430
Why is his shadow balding?

2079
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:47,410
Oh my god, you're right.

2080
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:48,210
Look at his shadow.

2081
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:49,230
He's got no hair.

2082
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:54,210
Boss, where's your hair at?

2083
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:07,490
I thought about putting this on when I was getting paused, but I was like, I'm too scared.

2084
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:10,470
I'm going to get spotted.

2085
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:25,790
Foreshadowing.

2086
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:26,550
Don't say that.

2087
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:29,830
And then there's Heaven's Divide.

2088
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:33,810
What's this one?

2089
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:36,030
Is this one just the actual song?

2090
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:38,390
Oh.

2091
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:42,530
No, it's like also like a... orchestral version.

2092
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:50,310
Oh god, it's so loud.

2093
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:01,230
What else we got?

2094
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:03,890
Of course, Ride of the Valor...

2095
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,550
We got Grease for some reason.

2096
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:08,930
I don't quite understand why this is on here.

2097
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,210
Internet.

2098
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,180
What else we got on here?

2099
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,440
Pauze's Diary Entries.

2100
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,280
There's so many of them.

2101
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:30,180
Wait, how long are they?

2102
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:30,880
I can't remember.

2103
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,020
Do we want to...

2104
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:35,040
Let's play some more missions first, and then we can listen.

2105
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:35,780
Listen.

2106
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:40,140
Because I want to do...

2107
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:46,150
Richard Wagner, my favorite MGS composer.

2108
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,890
I want to do...

2109
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:49,730
Is it this one?

2110
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:50,250
Yeah.

2111
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:52,290
Yeah.

2112
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:54,170
I want to do this one.

2113
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:56,530
Because this one's silly.

2114
01:40:57,370 --> 01:40:58,410
And then...

2115
01:40:58,410 --> 01:40:59,050
This one.

2116
01:40:59,250 --> 01:40:59,910
And then this one.

2117
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:02,950
So let's do this one first.

2118
01:41:04,410 --> 01:41:05,010
So...

2119
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:09,130
The mother base agent undercover at the prison facility has signaled for immediate evac.

2120
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:12,350
Secure the agent and escape the mission area by chopper.

2121
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:15,410
Apocalypse now movie reference.

2122
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:16,010
Oh.

2123
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,470
I guess that makes sense.

2124
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:19,870
I droid play invisible.

2125
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:20,310
No!

2126
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:22,450
No!

2127
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:24,410
No!

2128
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:29,330
But...

2129
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:31,510
I don't know what I'm going to have my chopper.

2130
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:32,270
What...

2131
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:35,590
What I will make the song be when it picks us up.

2132
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:43,910
We got a request for extraction from a member of the intel team who is working undercover at the prison.

2133
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:45,770
As you know, it's an enemy.

2134
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:46,510
With three!

2135
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:48,090
With no time for the silent approach.

2136
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:50,090
Assault the base.

2137
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:50,810
Where?

2138
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,490
Get out of there.

2139
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:55,990
The target is our agent from the intel team.

2140
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:56,570
J.F.

2141
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:57,590
Ray Eyewin.

2142
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,570
The base of particle VIP would be a massive underdainment.

2143
01:41:59,570 --> 01:41:59,990
Fancy.

2144
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:04,730
Bring

2145
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,260
him home, boss.

2146
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,380
Got it.

2147
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:22,590
Where's our guy?

2148
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:23,670
Where is everybody?

2149
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:25,090
This base is empty.

2150
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:25,710
Hello?

2151
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,870
Anybody here?

2152
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,050
Hello?

2153
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:31,110
I'm trying.

2154
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:32,830
There's nobody here.

2155
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:33,070
Oh.

2156
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:33,670
Oh.

2157
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:34,230
Oh.

2158
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:35,110
Where'd that guy go?

2159
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:35,570
Oh.

2160
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:36,430
I just lost him.

2161
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:38,010
Where'd he go?

2162
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:38,550
Wait.

2163
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:39,610
Wait.

2164
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:39,950
Where'd he go?

2165
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:41,010
Where'd...

2166
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,290
Where'd that guy go?

2167
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:43,290
Where'd he go?

2168
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:50,300
Where'd he go?

2169
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:51,380
Damn it.

2170
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:51,940
Where is he?

2171
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:54,560
Where?

2172
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,040
Where?

2173
01:42:58,910 --> 01:42:59,770
Where is he?

2174
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:00,850
Where?

2175
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:01,590
11 o'clock.

2176
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:01,890
What?

2177
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:03,890
Oh, over there.

2178
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:10,060
person.

2179
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:10,200
Oh, shoot.

2180
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:10,680
Not at me..

2181
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:10,800
oh!

2182
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,420
Oh, uh... Okay.

2183
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:17,100
Okay!

2184
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:18,960
Kill!

2185
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:19,480
Kill!

2186
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:19,800
Kill!

2187
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:20,220
Kill!

2188
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,040
Kill!

2189
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:21,360
Kill!

2190
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:21,740
Kill!

2191
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,140
Oh, kill!

2192
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:23,560
Kill!

2193
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:23,560
Kill!

2194
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,020
Kill, kill, kill.

2195
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:24,780
Hey.

2196
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:26,180
Yeah.

2197
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,860
Kill, kill, kill.

2198
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,000
Kill.

2199
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:30,180
Oh.

2200
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,000
There we go.

2201
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:33,420
Kill, kill, kill.

2202
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,440
We have permission this time, guys.

2203
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,060
We have permission to kill.

2204
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,200
We're good.

2205
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,760
We have permission to kill.

2206
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,640
Where is everybody?

2207
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:53,360
Oh my god.

2208
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,060
I can't.

2209
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,200
Take out those hostiles.

2210
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:58,660
Where's hostiles?

2211
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,560
Where are they?

2212
01:43:59,660 --> 01:43:59,960
Oh, here.

2213
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,320
I got them.

2214
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:03,580
I got them.

2215
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,840
I got them.

2216
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:05,440
I got you.

2217
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:06,600
I got you, buddy.

2218
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:08,900
Oh.

2219
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,780
Boss, the target's dead.

2220
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,040
Mission failed.

2221
01:44:26,370 --> 01:44:26,870
Wow.

2222
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:32,180
Where did that come from?

2223
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:32,980
For real?

2224
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:37,100
Flare.

2225
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:38,620
Flare.

2226
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:42,810
Can I get the birds?

2227
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:46,070
Oh, there's some people.

2228
01:44:58,940 --> 01:44:59,720
Ouchie, ouch.

2229
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,000
What?

2230
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:00,640
I got you.

2231
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:01,940
Go away.

2232
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:03,960
Grenade.

2233
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:05,400
Oh, wait.

2234
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,520
I have a grenade launcher.

2235
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:07,400
Wait, how do I switch?

2236
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,600
How do I switch it?

2237
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:11,680
Wait, hold on.

2238
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:12,480
Wait.

2239
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,260
Uh, anyway.

2240
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,220
Uh, what?

2241
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,380
When did I get the...

2242
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:20,500
Did I... Where?

2243
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:21,000
Where?

2244
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:21,080
Where?

2245
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:21,580
What?

2246
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,640
Why while aiming?

2247
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:25,260
Oh.

2248
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:29,220
Oh.

2249
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:33,080
Oh my god.

2250
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,120
Where did the grenade come from?

2251
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:36,140
Or where did the...

2252
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:36,560
Where?

2253
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,000
Oh.

2254
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:39,720
No, why?

2255
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:40,240
Sorry.

2256
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,200
Please, please, please.

2257
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,000
Don't kill him.

2258
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,020
Don't kill him.

2259
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,040
Don't...

2260
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,020
All hot stuff down.

2261
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,020
Touchdown is a no-go.

2262
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:59,580
I'm going to include the helipad.

2263
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:03,610
Inless escort.

2264
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:05,770
Boss, cover the friendly vehicle.

2265
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:10,750
I'm getting his ass.

2266
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:11,830
I'm getting this guy's ass.

2267
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:14,550
Come on.

2268
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:15,350
It's safe.

2269
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:16,570
Maybe.

2270
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:18,550
Maybe.

2271
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:20,710
Okay.

2272
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,120
Gotta give it to the boss.

2273
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:32,460
Cassette tape.

2274
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:32,740
Oh.

2275
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:33,320
Oh.

2276
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:34,860
Hey.

2277
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:38,760
Oh my god.

2278
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,760
I just broke that cactus.

2279
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,180
I'm going to jail for real.

2280
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:43,720
Oh my god.

2281
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,820
I just broke a cactus.

2282
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:45,960
Oh, sorry.

2283
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:47,460
Hold on.

2284
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:48,260
Oh my god.

2285
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,200
Thank you.

2286
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:49,780
Gosh.

2287
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:51,720
Where's that coming from?

2288
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:51,960
Oh.

2289
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:52,460
Oh.

2290
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:55,540
This way?

2291
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,180
This way?

2292
01:46:58,420 --> 01:46:58,720
Oh.

2293
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,460
This way?

2294
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,640
Oh, shoot.

2295
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:05,300
Ah!

01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,060

2297
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:08,660

You're good.

2299
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,180
You're good.

2300
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,300
Thank you.

2301
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:32,640
Me?

2302
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:34,000
You still talking about me?

2303
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:39,250
You still talking about me?

2304
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:41,650
I should have reloaded.

2305
01:47:44,030 --> 01:47:44,650
No.

2306
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:47,190
By that!

2307
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:48,150
Oh.

2308
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:48,670
Dang it.

2309
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:49,670
I keep pressing the wrong thing.

2310
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:53,970
Semper Fi!

2311
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:55,830
Holy cow!

2312
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:56,490
Woo!

2313
01:47:58,530 --> 01:47:59,410
Semper Fi!

2314
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:03,610
Semper Fi!

2315
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:04,730
Semper Fi!

2316
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:16,750
Oh my god.

2317
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,050
This?

2318
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:17,590
This?

2319
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:18,610
Ah!

2320
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:19,650
Ah!

2321
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:20,470
Reload!

2322
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:21,730
Reload!

2323
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:26,760
Oh my god.

2324
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:31,160
Yeah, I know.

2325
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,180
That's what you told me to do.

2326
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:37,300
Where is he?

2327
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:38,020
Oh, there he is.

2328
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:41,540
Man!

2329
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:49,180
Where is he?

2330
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:49,560
Oh.

2331
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:55,290
My guy!

2332
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:56,130
He's still alive.

2333
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:56,550
It's fine.

2334
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:57,670
Where the hell?

2335
01:48:59,290 --> 01:49:01,010
Can I hit that thing over there?

2336
01:49:01,150 --> 01:49:01,250
No?

2337
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:02,930
Oh my god.

2338
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:04,170
How are you still alive?

2339
01:49:06,410 --> 01:49:07,430
Where's the other people?

2340
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:08,650
Enemy reinforcement.

2341
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:10,190
Enemy reinforcement.

2342
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:16,980
Ah!

2343
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,520
Ah!

2344
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:20,620
Shoot the kill!

2345
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,280
Shoot the kill!

2346
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:26,470
Shoot.

2347
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,070
Shoot.

2348
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:28,370
Oh, dang it.

2349
01:49:28,570 --> 01:49:28,830
Shoot.

2350
01:49:30,170 --> 01:49:30,770
Hello?

2351
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:32,870
Oh, there you are.

2352
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:39,730
More reinforcement!

2353
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:41,670
Let them get close.

2354
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:43,830
Where are you scope to target enemies from a distance?

2355
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:44,610
Where are they?

2356
01:49:45,310 --> 01:49:46,070
Oh, okay.

2357
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:47,290
Oh.

2358
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:48,690
What?

2359
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:49,950
Woo!

2360
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:10,230
Let's do it!

2361
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:12,070
That was close.

2362
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:13,370
It was so close.

2363
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:14,350
Wait.

2364
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:15,350
Not that.

2365
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:17,270
Um...

2366
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:18,430
Please, please let me shoot it.

2367
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:19,410
Okay.

2368
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:24,750
Hey!

2369
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:29,530
These guys can really, uh... Can I get off the thing now?

2370
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:32,750
Oh wait, I didn't reload!

2371
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:33,510
I'm such an idiot!

2372
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:35,690
Uh-oh, I have like seven bullets.

2373
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:37,890
Hello!

2374
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:43,770
Um, wait...

2375
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:46,310
Let's switch to that, and uh...

2376
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:59,310
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

2377
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,300
Uh, yeah, we're good.

2378
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:08,860
Just take it out, just take it out.

2379
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,600
Take it out, take it out!

2380
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,500
More of them!

2381
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:19,620
Oh my god!

2382
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:21,980
Kazuhiro Miller, I do not want to hear it from you.

2383
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,320
I do not want to... Where are they?

2384
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:30,380
I do not want to hear it from you.

2385
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:31,800
Shut up taking them out when you're on the team.

2386
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:34,120
Shut your face!

2387
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:34,420
Please!

2388
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:36,820

2389
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:45,010
we go.

2390
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:45,870
Oh, wait.

2391
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,370
Where did they go?

2392
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:48,510
We're fine though, right?

2393
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:50,390
He's where?

2394
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:51,270
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

2395
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:01,380
Hello?

2396
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:07,900
Come here!

2397
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:09,480
Come here, mister!

2398
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:11,920
Come on!

2399
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:18,840
Don't die on me!

2400
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,980
Don't die on me, very important!

2401
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:34,660
We got this!

2402
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,540
We got this.

2403
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,600
Damn it, I don't got this.

2404
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:42,580
I missed.

2405
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:43,940
Stealth mission.

2406
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,100
This isn't a stealth mission.

2407
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,520
Oh my god!

2408
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,340
He'll regret it.

2409
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:57,160
Oh yeah!

2410
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,700
Oh yeah!

2411
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,720
Look at you, you're wobbling.

2412
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:04,120
Oh yeah!

2413
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:04,880
Oh yeah!

2414
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,540
Nice shot, thank you.

2415
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:11,420
Why'd you crash into that, you dummy?

2416
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,160
You stupid helicopter!

2417
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:15,140
Why'd you do that?

2418
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:17,880
Why'd you do that?

2419
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:18,680
Why did you do that?

2420
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,400
Who's shooting at me anyway?

2421
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,000
Thanks!

2422
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,580
That was smooth, boss!

2423
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,120
I know it was.

2424
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,280
Someone's shooting at us.

2425
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,640
Oh, that guy maybe over there?

2426
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:40,790
Blow up everything and everyone!

2427
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:43,090
Blow up

2428
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,080
everything and everyone!

2429
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:49,340
What?

2430
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:57,880
The one guy left in the whole base is shooting.

2431
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,920
Who could our very important...

2432
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,760
We're leaving hot zone!

2433
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:02,760
Returning to base!

2434
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:06,400
Who could our very important operative be?

2435
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,940
Confirmed!

2436
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:08,180
Confirmed!

2437
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:09,060
The target is safe!

2438
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:10,460
Oh!

2439
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:16,300
Snake!

2440
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:19,440
No way!

2441
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,700
Is that...

2442
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:23,340
No way!

2443
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,680
Is that...

2444
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,040
Oh my god!

2445
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,160
What took you so long?

2446
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:35,540
What took you so long?

2447
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:43,570
What took you so long?

2448
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:45,030
What took you so long?

2449
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:47,010
I only got 25 kills, you guys.

2450
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,810
Dang!

2451
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:50,450
I think if I hadn't killed anybody, I would have S that.

2452
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:52,310
Dang!

2453
01:54:54,990 --> 01:54:55,430
Yippee!

2454
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:57,810
We saved Hideo Kojima!

2455
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:05,150
Yeah, I got an A on that.

2456
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:05,650
Not bad.

2457
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:08,710
What took you so long?

2458
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:09,850
I think if you...

2459
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:12,830
I think if you S it...

2460
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:14,910
That's when he says snake.

2461
01:55:15,150 --> 01:55:15,970
That was perfect.

2462
01:55:17,230 --> 01:55:19,310
And that's when you S it, yeah.

2463
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:20,450
Yay!

2464
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:25,490
How are you supposed to do the tanks with no kills though?

2465
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:28,010
Seems scary.

2466
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:34,610
Look for the credits.

2467
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:40,310
That one's a silly one that I wanted to do.

2468
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:41,730
We have...

2469
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:43,970
Like I said, I've never done the...

2470
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:45,970
Duh.

2471
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:48,130
Deja vu.

2472
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:48,810
Bye, there he goes!

2473
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:50,010
Thank you for that, Kazuma!

2474
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:53,050
Every stream, I feel my checking account.

2475
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:54,170
My savings account.

2476
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:55,750
Even my PayPal account.

2477
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:57,150
The money I've lost.

2478
01:55:57,370 --> 01:55:58,750
The time I've lost.

2479
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:00,070
Mito's so cute.

2480
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:01,970
You're a wisp too, aren't you?

2481
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:06,390
We don't have that part yet.

2482
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:09,150
We don't have...

2483
01:56:09,150 --> 01:56:09,490
Oh look!

2484
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,270
And there he is!

2485
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:12,150
You guys see him behind the missions?

2486
01:56:12,730 --> 01:56:13,910
Watch, watch, watch what he does.

2487
01:56:13,910 --> 01:56:14,690
Oh my gosh!

2488
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:16,310
Thank you, Awesome, for the 20 gift!

2489
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:17,950
Thank you!

2490
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:24,790
Mr. Kojima, stop it!

2491
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:26,950
Look at his little mischievous face.

2492
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:32,690
Look at his little mischievous face.

2493
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:35,450
I've heard that deja vu is kind of difficult though.

2494
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:35,950
Is that true?

2495
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:41,050
Maybe we should do this one first.

2496
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:42,290
And then deja vu last.

2497
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:43,810
The snatcher one.

2498
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,770
It's kind of fun though.

2499
01:56:45,310 --> 01:56:45,890
No, it's not really?

2500
01:56:47,950 --> 01:56:48,590
Not at all?

2501
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:48,950
Oh!

2502
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:50,670
Oh, it's really tough to S rank.

2503
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:51,990
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

2504
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:53,050
Okay, okay.

2505
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:54,190
It's got puzzle elements.

2506
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:54,950
I do know that!

2507
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:55,690
I do know that.

2508
01:56:56,290 --> 01:56:57,970
So, we'll do these two.

2509
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:00,490
We'll listen to Paz's tapes, and then, yeah.

2510
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:05,790
I don't know which one I want to end on, to be honest.

2511
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:06,030
Oh my gosh.

2512
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:10,490
I feel like this one's more iconic.

2513
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:11,390
You know?

2514
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:15,030
A snake...

2515
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,690
A snake.

2516
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:18,150
S rank needs rushing, which is hard.

2517
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:20,310
Ah, I see, I see.

2518
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:22,670
Stop!

2519
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:24,570
Kojima, stop it!

2520
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:25,770
I'm trying to...

2521
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:27,510
Yeah, let's end on deja vu then.

2522
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:29,250
So, we'll do...

2523
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:30,210
How do you say this?

2524
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:31,270
Jamais vu?

2525
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:32,550
Jamais vu?

2526
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:34,430
I don't know France.

2527
01:57:36,190 --> 01:57:37,890
Even though my last name is French.

2528
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:41,990
Uh...

2529
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:42,230
Yeah.

2530
01:57:43,610 --> 01:57:44,030
What is this?

2531
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:46,850
Our galaxy consists of some 300 billion stars.

2532
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:48,790
Around half are orbited by planets.

2533
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:51,130
Schrodinger's cat.

2534
01:57:57,460 --> 01:58:00,320
I've never played these last two missions before, so I'm excited.

2535
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:08,150
Feeling like things should be familiar, but they are.

2536
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:12,050
We got an urgent request to investigate unusual activity of the U.S.

2537
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:12,810
Naval Facility.

2538
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:13,410
In Cuba.

2539
01:58:13,970 --> 01:58:21,130
According to our men in the CIA, they lost all contact with the base shortly after a Soviet commuter jet crashed into the coast nearby.

2540
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:30,450
But the strange thing is that when comms were restored 24 hours later, the only message received was conditions normal.

2541
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:30,610
Oh.

2542
01:58:30,610 --> 01:58:31,510
And that was it.

2543
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:32,010
Mmm.

2544
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:34,890
The planes hit the bottom of the ocean now.

2545
01:58:35,050 --> 01:58:37,250
But before it sank, someone...

2546
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:38,110
Some thing...

2547
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:38,610
Some thing!

2548
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:40,650
Murphy, I see your super chat.

2549
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:42,130
I'm waiting until the cuts themselves out.

2550
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,710
The Pentagon's assessment chimes with the intel from our on-site informant.

2551
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:49,610
Signs indicate that the base has been taken over by some unknown entity.

2552
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:50,050
Wow!

2553
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:54,270
Intelligent beings that attack people and steal their identity.

2554
01:58:54,410 --> 01:58:54,690
No!

2555
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:56,770
That's right, boss.

2556
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,450
Body snatchers.

2557
01:58:58,510 --> 01:58:59,870
Body snatchers!

2558
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:02,090
What are you calling me?

2559
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:03,610
The watermelons!

2560
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:07,130
Zero

2561
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:17,410
or not, these things aren't exactly your jurisdiction.

2562
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:20,770
But we've got a secret weapon.

2563
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:23,810
A man from another world.

2564
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:26,010
A dark, distant future.

2565
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:27,690
Melons.

2566
01:59:27,690 --> 01:59:32,410
A man made into a war machine with no human body for those bastards to snatch.

2567
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:33,690
Yeah!

2568
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:38,790
As payment, all we need to do is hand over the XOF badges you've gathered on your missions.

2569
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:42,870
Biddy biddy biddy biddy biddy b.

2570
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:51,770
Yeah, so basically in the main mission, there's those little XOF patches that are scattered around the base and you just kind of find them.

2571
01:59:51,910 --> 01:59:52,550
Oh my god!

2572
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:54,890
Original soundtrack!

2573
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:02,650
Oh my god!

2574
02:00:02,790 --> 02:00:04,190
But why the melons?

2575
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:05,010
Because...

2576
02:00:05,010 --> 02:00:06,110
It's like a...

2577
02:00:06,710 --> 02:00:08,290
Popular thing that...

2578
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:09,270
Raiden...

2579
02:00:09,590 --> 02:00:12,110
Like to cut up the melons in Rising.

2580
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,600
So we're good to kill!

2581
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:24,900
We're good to kill, baby.

2582
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:25,760
Look at him!

2583
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,080
He's like, go get him, kid!

2584
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:28,420
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2585
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:50,420
Eliminate any and all snatchers occupying the Cuban naval base and prison camp.

2586
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,740
There's no telling what will happen to the world if you lose.

2587
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:54,460
Wow!

2588
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:00,200
It's so weird hearing cars say run!

2589
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,620
Yay!

2590
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,420
Wow, that's a great shot.

2591
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:08,360
Yay!

2592
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:21,110
Um, Murphy asked earlier if I was planning on playing, um...

2593
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:21,830
VR missions.

2594
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:23,450
To pick them out, you'll first need to mark a target.

2595
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:25,910
That'll let you feel them out.

2596
02:01:26,770 --> 02:01:27,650
And, um...

2597
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:28,110
Oh my god.

2598
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:28,950
Cos, please show up.

2599
02:01:30,650 --> 02:01:33,750
I've sent the target's predicted field of movement to your eye droid.

2600
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:37,850
Wipe out the snatchers posing as marines and neutralize all survivors.

2601
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:40,250
Destroying them won't add to your kill count.

2602
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:40,890
Oh, nice.

2603
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:42,110
Eliminate the snatchers.

2604
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:43,870
Eliminate the snatchers.

2605
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:44,350
Eliminate the snatchers.

2606
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:46,590
Um, but yeah, it's funny that you asked that, Murphy.

2607
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:51,510
Because literally someone today in the meet and greet was just like, Are you gonna play VR missions?

2608
02:01:53,410 --> 02:01:54,430
So maybe sometime.

2609
02:02:01,110 --> 02:02:02,310
Oh my goodness.

2610
02:02:02,410 --> 02:02:04,230
Robots built using cutting edge bionics.

2611
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:07,730
We have no idea where they came from or what they want.

2612
02:02:07,930 --> 02:02:09,210
I don't know where any of these guys are.

2613
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:09,730
Like us.

2614
02:02:09,870 --> 02:02:11,610
But the reality is something...

2615
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:12,370
Oh.

2616
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:14,210
Nevermind.

2617
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:14,590
Someone's there.

2618
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:16,390
Try marking him.

2619
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:17,250
Wait, someone...

2620
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:17,530
Is he human?

2621
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:18,430
Or one of them?

2622
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:18,890
Where?

2623
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:19,370
Feel him out.

2624
02:02:19,690 --> 02:02:20,970
Who are you talking about?

2625
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:22,130
Who do you see?

2626
02:02:23,490 --> 02:02:25,130
Kazuhiro Miller has special eyes.

2627
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:26,510
Who are you talking about?

2628
02:02:26,850 --> 02:02:27,830
There's nobody here.

2629
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:29,770
There.

2630
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:30,810
Huh?

2631
02:02:31,030 --> 02:02:32,850
He like even stopped talking.

2632
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:37,820
Kazuhiro Miller...

2633
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:39,440
Who are you talking about?

2634
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:41,820
Kaz needs his pills.

2635
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:48,400
So this guy is normal.

2636
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,180
He's not a snatcher.

2637
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:49,480
Yeah.

2638
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:52,320
But still, there's something not quite right about him.

2639
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:53,960
What do you mean by that?

2640
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:54,540
Oh, yeah.

2641
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,920
Because he's like...

2642
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:56,840
Interrogate him.

2643
02:02:56,980 --> 02:02:58,000
Find out what he knows.

2644
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:58,920
Oh, okay.

2645
02:02:58,960 --> 02:02:59,600
That's kind of fun.

2646
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:08,190
Making sure there's nobody else around.

2647
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:10,370
Like I said, I've never done this mission before.

2648
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:11,410
So I don't know where...

2649
02:03:11,410 --> 02:03:12,910
A lot of the enemies are.

2650
02:03:15,150 --> 02:03:16,130
In this one.

2651
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:18,950
Are you...

2652
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:20,870
Are you...

2653
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:21,130
Normal?

2654
02:03:29,290 --> 02:03:29,710
Speak.

2655
02:03:29,730 --> 02:03:30,090
Speak.

2656
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:32,830
I can tell you where our men are stationed from.

2657
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,450
I have no idea what's happening.

2658
02:03:37,630 --> 02:03:39,290
I had no idea Raiden was in ground zero.

2659
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:40,790
Hello.

2660
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:40,910
Hello.

2661
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:42,570
Well, now you do.

2662
02:03:49,170 --> 02:03:50,630
Turn the light off.

2663
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:51,130
Thank you.

2664
02:03:52,170 --> 02:03:52,910
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2665
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:53,830
There we go.

2666
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:54,370
Thank you.

2667
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:57,390
One out of 12.

2668
02:03:58,270 --> 02:03:58,850
Oh, see?

2669
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:00,930
There's a sn... Is that a snatcher?

2670
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:01,510
Wait.

2671
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:06,030
I think he's... You only marked one guy.

2672
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:08,710
What do you mean our guys are marked here?

2673
02:04:08,710 --> 02:04:09,870
You only marked one of them.

2674
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:15,710
What do you mean our guys are...

2675
02:04:18,230 --> 02:04:19,350
I'm blinding him?

2676
02:04:23,170 --> 02:04:25,490
He's like, get that light out of my face!

2677
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:31,210
I hear someone, like, snoring.

2678
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:32,750
I think it's the guy just knocked out, though.

2679
02:04:34,950 --> 02:04:37,070
Get that light out of my face!

2680
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:38,730
Okay.

2681
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:46,530
So, because he's an alien...

2682
02:04:47,110 --> 02:04:48,090
We're good to kill.

2683
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:49,650
What is he looking at?

2684
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:56,800
What are you suspicious of, huh?

2685
02:04:57,580 --> 02:04:58,820
Maybe I can kill him from here.

2686
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:05,980
What are those things?

2687
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:07,260
Whoa!

2688
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:07,740
Whoa!

2689
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:09,980
Whoa, he's burning!

2690
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:12,100
Whoa!

2691
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:14,020
Nice, nice.

2692
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,480
Take care of the next one.

2693
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:17,140
So...

2694
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:17,900
Where?

2695
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:19,600
There's only 12 guys on the base?

2696
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:23,680
Holy cow!

2697
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,180
We're so fast!

2698
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:26,560
Whoa!

2699
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:28,420
Raiden.

2700
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:31,820
Damn.

2701
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:34,020
I don't know what I expected.

2702
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:38,140
Let's check from up here.

2703
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:39,340
Maybe there's any...

2704
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:40,480
Guys we could see?

2705
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:42,260
Oh, no.

2706
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:42,920
Raiden, stop.

2707
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:44,100
Raiden.

2708
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,580
If there's only 12 people here...

2709
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:53,440
It's more like hide and seek...

2710
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:54,740
Than anything else.

2711
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:56,160
Oh, oh.

2712
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:58,800
This guy seems normal.

2713
02:05:58,800 --> 02:05:59,240
Oh!

2714
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,520
What is that?

2715
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:01,940
No mistake.

2716
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:02,900
That's a snatcher.

2717
02:06:03,700 --> 02:06:04,720
Eliminate it.

2718
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,880
Eliminate it.

2719
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:08,180
The music?

2720
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:11,640
Too awesome.

2721
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:12,840
Oh my gosh.

2722
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,200
It's too good.

2723
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:16,080
Let's see.

2724
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:16,880
Anywhere else?

2725
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:20,200
Needle gear salad.

2726
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:21,800
My beloved series.

2727
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:23,360
Yeah.

2728
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:25,520
Me too.

2729
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:25,560
Go.

2730
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:28,760
Try the intel button.

2731
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,560
That's the base's admin building.

2732
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:36,440
Security looks tight.

2733
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:37,120
Does it?

2734
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:37,920
I don't know.

2735
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:39,540
There's nobody here.

2736
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:41,340
I don't know about that, guys.

2737
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,960
It actually looks quite dead around here.

2738
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:49,100
I'm kind of scared because it's so dead.

2739
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:50,420
I'm afraid to walk.

2740
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:51,820
Like, I don't know.

2741
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:55,180
I don't know where it's fine to walk to.

2742
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:58,120
Security looks tight.

2743
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:00,060
Don't lie to me.

2744
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:00,580
Wait.

2745
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:01,520
Is there somebody up there?

2746
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:02,260
No.

2747
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:03,580
There's nobody here.

2748
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:06,120
Check the map.

2749
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:08,080
Oh.

2750
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:11,520
What's this?

2751
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:12,820
Is that a landing?

2752
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:13,400
What is that?

2753
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,420
Anticipated enemy location.

2754
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:21,900
Okay.

2755
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,700
There's gonna be...

2756
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:26,540
Let's go around.

2757
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:34,940
I'm running around like I own the base.

2758
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:40,510
I wonder if I can get that guy from here.

2759
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:41,830
You know?

2760
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:44,750
Also...

2761
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:48,970
Well, if it isn't Saucy Jack.

2762
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:51,970
Smoke grenade!

2763
02:07:57,470 --> 02:07:58,170
Yeah?

2764
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:03,410
Thanks!

2765
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:08,090
We're gonna neutralize all human survivors.

2766
02:08:08,310 --> 02:08:08,670
Okay.

2767
02:08:10,010 --> 02:08:10,770
Can I get...

2768
02:08:10,770 --> 02:08:11,690
What if I...

2769
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:12,330
Do the...

2770
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,590
The best...

2771
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:15,150
Headshot ever here.

2772
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:18,770
Oh?

2773
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:21,230
Oh, shoot.

2774
02:08:23,330 --> 02:08:24,290
No, you're...

2775
02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:25,010
You're a snatcher!

2776
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:31,170
I can't...

2777
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:34,370
I think I messed up.

2778
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:40,390
Okay, I think he's dead.

2779
02:08:40,770 --> 02:08:40,870
No.

2780
02:08:41,570 --> 02:08:42,230
What the...

2781
02:08:42,230 --> 02:08:43,010
Man down!

2782
02:08:44,610 --> 02:08:45,870
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

2783
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:49,710
Yeah, why are the snatchers able to...

2784
02:08:49,710 --> 02:08:50,210
Oh, see?

2785
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:50,870
That's a snatcher.

2786
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:52,770
Nice

2787
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:03,440
work.

2788
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,680
Take care of the next one.

2789
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:09,960
Die, snatcher scum!

2790
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,220
It's kinda cool.

2791
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:21,040
Die, snatcher scum!

2792
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:22,460
Hmm...

2793
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:23,740
Anybody over there?

2794
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:28,140
Who are you?

2795
02:09:29,580 --> 02:09:30,840
A human!

2796
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:43,620
Nobody will see me there, right?

2797
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:44,960
Or...

2798
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,960
Anybody else around?

2799
02:09:46,730 --> 02:09:47,160
This...

2800
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:47,820
It's...

2801
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:49,320
This base is so dead!

2802
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:50,520
It's crazy!

2803
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:58,050
A human...

2804
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:02,800
I don't see anybody else.

2805
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:03,380
Anybody else?

2806
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:06,400
Trying to use my eyes...

2807
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,720
Like a quick glance.

2808
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:11,000
See literally nothing.

2809
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:16,240
I'm a snatcher!

2810
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:16,880
What?

2811
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:20,770
Whoa!

2812
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:22,150
I possess!

2813
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:23,710
But I do not sn...

2814
02:10:23,710 --> 02:10:24,330
Snatch!

2815
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:38,240
Oh!

2816
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:41,100
Um...

2817
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,000
How do we do this?

2818
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:49,190
Uh...

2819
02:10:49,190 --> 02:10:49,910
Is there anybody over there?

2820
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:52,790
How do we...

2821
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:53,010
Wait.

2822
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:54,860
How do I...

2823
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:00,130
Ouch.

2824
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:00,750
Oh.

2825
02:11:01,150 --> 02:11:01,410
Oh.

2826
02:11:01,410 --> 02:11:02,490
Oh.

2827
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:04,030
Oh.

2828
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:05,410
Oh.

2829
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:06,350
Oh.

2830
02:11:08,990 --> 02:11:09,550
Oh.

2831
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:10,070
How kind of...

2832
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:10,270
You!

2833
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:10,810
No!

2834
02:11:13,210 --> 02:11:13,490
What?

2835
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:15,670
Stop!

2836
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:21,740
Stop right in front of me!

2837
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:28,140
Please!

2838
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:31,300
Oh.

2839
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:32,440
Oh, I...

2840
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:32,700
Oh!

2841
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:33,800
I got the other guy!

2842
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:34,740
Oh my gosh.

2843
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:35,160
Wait.

2844
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:40,540
He wakes up immediately.

2845
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:41,700
That's crazy.

2846
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:51,870
That gun will be as loud as any other now.

2847
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:52,330
Uh-oh.

2848
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:53,330
If you have to shoot...

2849
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:53,950
Be careful.

2850
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:55,150
Oh.

2851
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:57,390
You did not hear gunfire.

2852
02:11:58,450 --> 02:11:59,310
You didn't.

2853
02:11:59,490 --> 02:11:59,910
You didn't.

2854
02:12:01,330 --> 02:12:01,830
Um...

2855
02:12:03,330 --> 02:12:03,830
Oops.

2856
02:12:05,290 --> 02:12:05,790
Uh...

2857
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:08,710
It's no good.

2858
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:11,830
Those snatchers just shrug off knockouts and tranquilizers.

2859
02:12:12,030 --> 02:12:12,430
It's fine.

2860
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:12,870
He's dead.

2861
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:17,750
It's fine.

2862
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:18,130
He's dead.

2863
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:22,330
It's fine.

2864
02:12:22,710 --> 02:12:24,070
I kicked him to death.

2865
02:12:26,290 --> 02:12:27,830
Maybe we can get another...

2866
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:29,090
Uh...

2867
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:30,170
What's it called in here?

2868
02:12:33,250 --> 02:12:33,790
Ugh.

2869
02:12:34,350 --> 02:12:35,090
What's the word?

2870
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:35,630
Ooh!

2871
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:37,150
I could get a rocket launcher.

2872
02:12:39,190 --> 02:12:39,730
No.

2873
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:41,810
I was gonna say another suppressor.

2874
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:43,210
Sad.

2875
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:47,650
Okay.

2876
02:12:48,030 --> 02:12:49,370
Where's our other friends at?

2877
02:12:50,770 --> 02:12:52,310
Anticipated enemy location.

2878
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:54,250
It's literally where I'm at.

2879
02:12:54,770 --> 02:12:55,370
Nobody's here.

2880
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:56,610
There's no party.

2881
02:12:58,530 --> 02:12:59,210
Oh.

2882
02:13:00,490 --> 02:13:01,170
Who said that?

2883
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:01,690
Oh, you.

2884
02:13:02,570 --> 02:13:02,990
Oh.

2885
02:13:03,070 --> 02:13:03,310
No.

2886
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,890
You're a bad guy.

2887
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:09,960
Oh, shoot.

2888
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:12,360
Did I kill him?

2889
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:13,080
No.

2890
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:14,420
Oh, god.

2891
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:14,880
Ooh.

2892
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:15,580
This is not good.

2893
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:16,940
Killed him.

2894
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:20,800
Do you have to say pause in this mission?

2895
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:21,100
Nope.

2896
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:25,200
Standing down?

2897
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,140
Okay.

2898
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:28,680
No, in this we just have to kill the guys.

2899
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,580
I think now the rest are inside here probably.

2900
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:35,820
go.

2901
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:38,420
The end of the day.

2902
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:45,780
Hello.

2903
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:48,120
Excuse me.

2904
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,880
CP, this is Zulu2.

2905
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:51,700
We've got unidentified gunfire.

2906
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:52,660
Occasion unknown.

2907
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:53,080
My bad.

2908
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:55,680
CP, understood.

2909
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:58,840
All take threats immediately and eliminate the distresses.

2910
02:13:58,980 --> 02:13:59,260
Out.

2911
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,320
Eliminate?

2912
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:02,300
No.

2913
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,800
Alert status...

2914
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:07,300
But there's like five guys.

2915
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:12,830
Oh.

2916
02:14:12,830 --> 02:14:19,230
Wait, I need to... Okay.

2917
02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:21,030
And who sees me?

2918
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:22,030
Oh, the camera!

2919
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:26,570
Ah!

2920
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:31,120
Contact!

2921
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:31,680
Uh-oh.

2922
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:32,980
Wait, I need to know what you are.

2923
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:34,580
You're a bad guy!

2924
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:35,740
Kill, kill, kill!

2925
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:39,700
I think I saw another guy.

2926
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:41,760
How many were left?

2927
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,240
Not the surveillance camp.

2928
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:46,920
Get out of here.

2929
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:47,500
Who said that?

2930
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:51,260
Nice shot, thank you!

2931
02:14:54,620 --> 02:14:58,420
You stinkin'... Contact!

2932
02:14:58,760 --> 02:14:58,780
Where?

2933
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:02,960
Those guys are there?

2934
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:05,080
How did I unlock the third door?

2935
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:05,860
What did I do?

2936
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:07,480
Oh!

2937
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:09,360
What are you?

2938
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:10,060
What are you?

2939
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:11,080
Wait, what are you?

2940
02:15:14,190 --> 02:15:15,030
You're so dead.

2941
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:16,850
Oh, this is our last guy!

2942
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:18,310
What are you?

2943
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:19,270
What are you?

2944
02:15:19,470 --> 02:15:19,750
Bad!

2945
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:27,450
Any last words?

2946
02:15:30,670 --> 02:15:31,950
Good work, Raiden.

2947
02:15:32,110 --> 02:15:35,570
All snatchers confirmed eliminated and survivors neutralized.

2948
02:15:36,050 --> 02:15:37,530
The analysis can wait.

2949
02:15:37,870 --> 02:15:38,910
We need to get you out of there.

2950
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:39,230
Okay.

2951
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:41,090
I'm sending a chopper to the floor.

2952
02:15:41,570 --> 02:15:41,970
Oh, wait.

2953
02:15:42,090 --> 02:15:42,970
Oh, there are doors right here?

2954
02:15:43,650 --> 02:15:44,090
Helipad!

2955
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:44,930
Oh, come on.

2956
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:46,850
Raiden doesn't know how to open doors.

2957
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:48,190
I'm a robot!

2958
02:15:49,650 --> 02:15:50,470
Cold blood?

2959
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:52,130
He's literally the submission!

2960
02:15:58,590 --> 02:15:59,350
I'm Raiden.

2961
02:15:59,490 --> 02:16:01,610
Look how small his steps are.

2962
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:08,150
You're so dainty, Raiden.

2963
02:16:09,390 --> 02:16:10,510
Can I take this guy with me?

2964
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:12,370
Just for funsies?

2965
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:13,490
Oh, my bad.

2966
02:16:13,970 --> 02:16:14,490
Wait, uh...

2967
02:16:16,110 --> 02:16:17,150
I'm taking him with me?

2968
02:16:18,910 --> 02:16:19,930
I got a new pet?

2969
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,280
Wait, what's happening?

2970
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:26,700
Reinforcements!

2971
02:16:26,700 --> 02:16:27,740
Where they come from?

2972
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:30,120
I'll have the chopper wait in the air.

2973
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:31,140
Oh, come on.

2974
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:32,940
Oh, come on.

2975
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:43,680
Who is it?

2976
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:46,580
Who is it?

2977
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:47,300
Oh, uh...

2978
02:16:58,370 --> 02:16:59,770
Who else wants to mess with me?

2979
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:01,610
Oh, right there?

2980
02:17:02,030 --> 02:17:03,650
I don't know what you are, but...

2981
02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:04,910
I couldn't care.

2982
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:05,370
Oh, see?

2983
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:06,730
I knew.

2984
02:17:07,290 --> 02:17:07,950
The tower?

2985
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:08,430
Oh, yeah.

2986
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:08,810
Thank you.

2987
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:09,830
What are you?

2988
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:10,530
Oh, my god!

2989
02:17:11,430 --> 02:17:12,550
Deal with him first.

2990
02:17:17,210 --> 02:17:18,150
Hey, you!

2991
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:20,270
Chill out!

2992
02:17:20,810 --> 02:17:21,650
I'm trying.

2993
02:17:22,570 --> 02:17:23,550
Oh, uh...

2994
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:28,930
I got him.

2995
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:30,790
I... Oh, no.

2996
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:31,570
Our thing is smoking.

2997
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:36,450
We're fine.

2998
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:37,990
Normal patrol.

2999
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:39,690
Wait, there's more?

3000
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:41,330
There's more?

3001
02:17:41,330 --> 02:17:41,570
Where?

3002
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:44,830
Let's chopper searchlight.

3003
02:17:44,990 --> 02:17:45,090
Oh.

3004
02:17:47,790 --> 02:17:48,450
There's more!

3005
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:51,450
Oh, shoot.

3006
02:17:51,590 --> 02:17:52,230
How did I miss?

3007
02:17:58,820 --> 02:18:00,940
I think all these guys are baddies.

3008
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:01,980
No?

3009
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:04,180
We're out!

3010
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:04,520
We're out!

3011
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:04,860
We're out!

3012
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:05,220
We're out!

3013
02:18:07,610 --> 02:18:08,190
We're out!

3014
02:18:08,330 --> 02:18:08,610
Whoo!

3015
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:09,870
Oh, over here?

3016
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:10,870
Oh, you!

3017
02:18:11,130 --> 02:18:11,590
Oh, my god.

3018
02:18:14,790 --> 02:18:16,110
I think I got this!

3019
02:18:16,510 --> 02:18:17,010
Oh, come on.

3020
02:18:17,190 --> 02:18:17,670
No!

3021
02:18:18,430 --> 02:18:19,290
Oh, my god!

3022
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:22,350
Oh, my god.

3023
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:23,330
That's so stupid!

3024
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:26,030
I just... Ow!

3025
02:18:26,330 --> 02:18:26,550
Ow!

3026
02:18:26,670 --> 02:18:27,910
I just needed to reload!

3027
02:18:29,030 --> 02:18:29,290
No!

3028
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:32,910
Oh, my god.

3029
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:34,530
Morpho!

3030
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:51,680
Okay.

3031
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:53,960
So these guys first?

3032
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,020
Oh, you!

3033
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:13,680
Just kill.

3034
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:14,400
Just unload.

3035
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:15,120
Just unload.

3036
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:16,600
Just unload.

3037
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:17,220
Just unload.

3038
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:17,860
Just unload.

3039
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:18,800
Just unload.

3040
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:20,600
I think he's dead.

3041
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:21,880
Dead.

3042
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:23,000
Just unload.

3043
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:23,740
Just unload.

3044
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:24,840
Another?

3045
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:25,780
Where?

3046
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:30,860
Just unload.

3047
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:31,640
Just unload.

3048
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:33,440
Just unload.

3049
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:35,500
Oh!

3050
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:37,320
I think that guy just glitched a little.

3051
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:39,060
Weep.

3052
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:40,460
Weep.

3053
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:00,460
There we go.

3054
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:02,500
The chopper!

3055
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:03,100
What do you mean?

3056
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:05,280
I'm working on it!

3057
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:05,840
Where?

3058
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:07,300
Where are they

3059
02:20:10,390 --> 02:20:10,550
actually?

3060
02:20:10,750 --> 02:20:11,710
What are you talking about?

3061
02:20:13,850 --> 02:20:14,350
Oh, wait.

3062
02:20:14,470 --> 02:20:15,630
There's an actual chopper?

3063
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:17,990
Where are our chopper?

3064
02:20:19,130 --> 02:20:20,410
Oh, you want us up there?

3065
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:22,610
He's targeting the chopper.

3066
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:23,030
Oh!

3067
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:24,150
Oh!

3068
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:25,770
That's not us!

3069
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:34,280
That's not us!

3070
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:53,570
We're both reloading.

3071
02:20:54,190 --> 02:20:55,730
Oh my god, there's so many guys here.

3072
02:20:56,410 --> 02:20:57,570
There's suddenly so many guys.

3073
02:20:57,950 --> 02:20:58,630
Oh my gosh.

3074
02:21:00,130 --> 02:21:00,530
Run!

3075
02:21:01,390 --> 02:21:01,390
Run!

3076
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:01,730
Run!

3077
02:21:02,050 --> 02:21:02,050
Run!

3078
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,350
Run!

3079
02:21:02,350 --> 02:21:02,510
Run!

3080
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:02,530
Run!

3081
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:03,230
Oh!

3082
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:04,130
Oh no, I'm gonna die!

3083
02:21:04,210 --> 02:21:04,510
I'm gonna die!

3084
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:04,970
I'm gonna die!

3085
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:06,070
Don't think anymore!

3086
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:09,750
Oh my god, this part's so stupid!

3087
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:11,550
Oh my god!

3088
02:21:12,670 --> 02:21:14,170
There's so many men!

3089
02:21:15,130 --> 02:21:16,910
Where did they all come from?

3090
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:19,530
Oh my god!

3091
02:21:19,630 --> 02:21:20,830
Do I have to start at the very beginning?

3092
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:22,290
Okay.

3093
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:24,270
What?

3094
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:24,830
This guy.

3095
02:21:25,450 --> 02:21:26,290
Okay, this chopper.

3096
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:28,130
This is not our chopper.

3097
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:29,610
This is the enemy chopper.

3098
02:21:33,470 --> 02:21:33,990
Nice.

3099
02:21:34,970 --> 02:21:35,610
You know what?

3100
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:36,430
I'm just gonna...

3101
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:39,250
As quickly as he came, he turned around.

3102
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:45,450
As soon as he came down.

3103
02:22:00,610 --> 02:22:01,050
Okay.

3104
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:03,690
That's the easier way to handle it, I suppose.

3105
02:22:04,910 --> 02:22:06,090
What are you looking at?

3106
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:09,470
Hey, Aegon, where?

3107
02:22:12,390 --> 02:22:13,290
Did I do it?

3108
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:16,350
Are there any more?

3109
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:16,950
Oh, there's a guy.

3110
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:25,420
Resuming normal patrol.

3111
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:26,660
Never mind.

3112
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:31,060
Oh my god, even more!

3113
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:35,640
More?

3114
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:37,280
How many more?

3115
02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:45,190
I'm trying!

3116
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:47,870
I'm seriously trying!

3117
02:22:49,310 --> 02:22:50,370
Oh my god.

3118
02:22:50,370 --> 02:22:50,750
Ugh.

3119
02:22:51,630 --> 02:22:52,150
I

3120
02:23:01,390 --> 02:23:02,490
don't know if I actually did it.

3121
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:04,430
Are you still working?

3122
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:05,750
Are you still alive?

3123
02:23:06,070 --> 02:23:06,870
Are you dead?

3124
02:23:07,170 --> 02:23:08,550
Oh, you're still alive, I think.

3125
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:14,910
Uh oh, we're almost out of rockets, you guys.

3126
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:24,270
Get to the chopper!

3127
02:23:27,110 --> 02:23:27,630
Yippee!

3128
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:28,410
Victory lap!

3129
02:23:43,130 --> 02:23:44,170
That's my boy.

3130
02:23:44,310 --> 02:23:45,350
Why did Kai say that?

3131
02:23:45,770 --> 02:23:46,950
I don't know.

3132
02:23:48,130 --> 02:23:49,570
Why did he say that?

3133
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:00,480
Yeah!

3134
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:03,040
Into the sky!

3135
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:05,520
Kill the aliens!

3136
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:18,350
Mission complete.

3137
02:24:18,570 --> 02:24:20,430
I guess it all worked out in the end.

3138
02:24:20,650 --> 02:24:20,890
Yeah.

3139
02:24:21,990 --> 02:24:22,390
Oof.

3140
02:24:25,470 --> 02:24:26,410
That's fine.

3141
02:24:27,970 --> 02:24:29,070
Snake didn't...

3142
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:30,670
Keeper Sutherland didn't say anything!

3143
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:36,530
He didn't say a dang word!

3144
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:41,190
Why was he accredited in this?

3145
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:45,530
He didn't have a single line!

3146
02:24:47,890 --> 02:24:48,690
All right.

3147
02:24:49,130 --> 02:24:50,190
The crisis is over.

3148
02:24:50,470 --> 02:24:51,490
Thanks to Raiden.

3149
02:24:51,650 --> 02:24:52,730
Thanks to Raiden.

3150
02:24:52,870 --> 02:24:55,570
But they never could determine what those snatchers really were.

3151
02:24:56,050 --> 02:24:58,490
I just hope they didn't have anything bigger planned.

3152
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:02,530
This whole thing was like some bad dream.

3153
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:07,830
What a uh...

3154
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:08,690
Like it seems...

3155
02:25:08,690 --> 02:25:10,410
It seems like they're trying to set up for something.

3156
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:20,220
I can't tell if they're like actually trying to set up for Snatcher or like...

3157
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:23,140
If they had other...

3158
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:24,270
You know, other...

3159
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:27,320
Things that they were thinking about doing with it.

3160
02:25:28,580 --> 02:25:30,300
Did you see that one trial?

3161
02:25:30,460 --> 02:25:32,460
It's called Fastest Marking of Crows.

3162
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:37,540
The white armor outfit has been unlocked.

3163
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:38,360
Whoa!

3164
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:41,000
Hard difficulty.

3165
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:46,820
I think it was mostly a reference.

3166
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:47,280
Maybe.

3167
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,200
Emotional support Kiefer.

3168
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:50,840
Yeah.

3169
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:56,120
Cool!

3170
02:25:57,300 --> 02:25:58,520
Cool, cool.

3171
02:25:58,920 --> 02:25:59,540
Let's do...

3172
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,180
No?

3173
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:02,160
Just this one.

3174
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:03,280
Deja vu!

3175
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:06,120
Peak mission incoming.

3176
02:26:07,180 --> 02:26:09,440
Or maybe we listen to pause tapes first.

3177
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:16,780
I know I keep switching around what I want to do.

3178
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:19,480
I'm just indecisive.

3179
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:26,900
Spy log.

3180
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:30,200
This is...

3181
02:26:32,660 --> 02:26:34,700
This is the one that is...

3182
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,140
That you can listen to in Peace Walker, no?

3183
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:45,280
As of today, I will be living here at Mother Base.

3184
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:47,460
Now my real trial begins.

3185
02:26:48,300 --> 02:26:48,420
Yeah.

3186
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:51,720
The doorknob was paying my room, board, and tuition.

3187
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,740
But he has since been captured.

3188
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:54,800
Womp womp.

3189
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:59,140
I told the man that with no more money from the KGB, I could no longer afford school.

3190
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:01,200
He bought my story.

3191
02:27:01,620 --> 02:27:06,440
And when I said I would be willing to work, he took pity on me and let me stay.

3192
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:10,940
For some reason, Miller really pled my case.

3193
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:12,440
That was helpful.

3194
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:14,460
But the man is still a fool.

3195
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:15,520
This is the doorknob.

3196
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:16,240
His men are no better.

3197
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:18,720
They think their training makes them strong.

3198
02:27:18,740 --> 02:27:20,000
Yeah, we listened to this one in Peace Walker.

3199
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:23,160
But that kind of strength is nothing in the face of true power.

3200
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:29,100
And better yet, they wait on me hand and foot, believing I am just a school girl.

3201
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:29,840
That's so cute.

3202
02:27:30,060 --> 02:27:32,540
Looks like I won't be working too hard after all.

3203
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:33,680
They love you, Paz!

3204
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:40,000
Just today, while scouting out the living quarters, I saw a group of them in the corner of the deck making a fuss.

3205
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:43,380
Going over for a look, I saw they were feeding a kitten.

3206
02:27:44,460 --> 02:27:46,500
A bunch of grown, hard men.

3207
02:27:46,820 --> 02:27:49,100
And they are the ones acting like school girls.

3208
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:50,640
I know, because they're so cute!

3209
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:51,640
Look, isn't he cute?

3210
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:52,480
And then they all died!

3211
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:53,300
I spoke with them.

3212
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:54,140
All of them!

3213
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:56,760
Disgusted, I just nodded and smiled.

3214
02:27:57,260 --> 02:27:59,560
I must stay in character after all.

3215
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:03,140
I indulged their chit chat for a few moments.

3216
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:05,960
Then one of them asked me to give the thing a name.

3217
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:08,320
They had just taken it from its mother.

3218
02:28:08,900 --> 02:28:10,300
I named it Nuke.

3219
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:16,280
I improvised some nonsense about how our compassion for living things can help prevent wars.

3220
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:19,100
The men gave me a little fish.

3221
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,140
I held it out in my palm and the kitten happily ate it up.

3222
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:26,880
What a pathetic, feeble creature.

3223
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:28,920
It sickens me.

3224
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:31,260
It's just a cat, pause.

3225
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:32,220
Stop being dramatic.

3226
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:36,280
Today, Chiko invited me to go fishing with the soldiers.

3227
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:37,700
Okay, these ones are all new.

3228
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:40,300
I suppose finding one's own food does have its merit.

3229
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:44,300
But I prefer not to be involved in such a degrading task.

3230
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:45,320
Or it's just fishing.

3231
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:46,880
And they're prattling on about fishing.

3232
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:47,020
What's wrong with fishing?

3233
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:47,760
Is it degrading?

3234
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:48,680
That is nonsense.

3235
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:51,280
I'm not here to find playmates.

3236
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:57,540
Nevertheless, distasteful as it was, I went along in order to maintain my cover.

3237
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:58,420
She is so edgy.

3238
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:00,740
Chiko thrust a fishing pole into my hands.

3239
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:04,400
And we went up onto the deck where several soldiers had gathered.

3240
02:29:04,620 --> 02:29:06,480
They welcomed us warmly.

3241
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:07,480
Is this Tara Strong?

3242
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:11,180
With so few women aboard Mother Base, I'm treated like a princess.

3243
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:11,860
I know.

3244
02:29:12,220 --> 02:29:16,000
No one suspects I am neither a teenager nor a student.

3245
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:16,980
They just love you, pause.

3246
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,920
It was nice and sunny, with a gentle breeze and waves.

3247
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:27,080
As I cast my line and waited for a bite, the soldiers began to ask me all sorts of questions.

3248
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:33,220
As always, I answered according to our predefined scenario, feigning a smile.

3249
02:29:33,220 --> 02:29:37,380
As I sat there feeding them lies, the fish began to bite.

3250
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:40,120
And the soldiers began to focus on their prey.

3251
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:46,860
Chiko had his bait stolen by a fish and got so angry that he stood up and nearly fell into the sea.

3252
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:48,760
Everybody laughed.

3253
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:51,720
It almost made me want to join in too.

3254
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:54,760
At some point, I got a bite myself.

3255
02:29:55,480 --> 02:30:01,480
The instant after I felt that first gentle tug, the fish yanked the line with astonishing strength.

3256
02:30:01,480 --> 02:30:02,120
Chat with me.

3257
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:03,660
And I let out a cry of surprise.

3258
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:06,220
I thought he was going to be huge.

3259
02:30:07,020 --> 02:30:08,580
It was my first time fishing.

3260
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:10,200
And I was a bit flustered.

3261
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:14,320
I love how it only takes the second diary entry for her, like, cave.

3262
02:30:14,740 --> 02:30:17,860
She starts to crack in the second entry.

3263
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,260
I know how to turn the handle as fast as I could.

3264
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:22,840
I wondered what kind of fish lived below the surface.

3265
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:27,200
And thought back to the deep sea dives I had to do as part of training.

3266
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:28,520
She ain't building this.

3267
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:29,560
Those were difficult days.

3268
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:36,100
But I remember finding the multicolored fish gliding through the water incredibly soothing.

3269
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:39,380
After a hard fight, I pulled it out.

3270
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:42,020
She's like, I have this hypnotherapy.

3271
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:43,100
It wasn't even half a vara.

3272
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:43,860
I hate men.

3273
02:30:44,060 --> 02:30:45,620
See Solid Snake one time.

3274
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:46,640
I love men.

3275
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,540
But I wasn't doing it for fun.

3276
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:50,740
So I wasn't the least bit disappointed.

3277
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:54,780
Nuke was hovering nearby with an expectant look on his face.

3278
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:56,860
So I gave the fish to him.

3279
02:30:56,980 --> 02:30:57,020
Nuke!

3280
02:30:57,570 --> 02:31:00,440
All in all, a thoroughly wasted day.

3281
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:03,780
Nuke on the base.

3282
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:05,720
Preparations are coming along nicely.

3283
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:10,800
No one suspects me of being the one to let Zdarnoff out of his cell.

3284
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:11,820
You!

3285
02:31:15,540 --> 02:31:15,620
You!

3286
02:31:15,820 --> 02:31:20,620
It is a simple home-cooked dish consisting of black frijoles mixed with arroz.

3287
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:25,160
It is well known throughout Central America, not just in Costa Rica.

3288
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:29,300
So it is no surprise that a Mika like Amanda would be good at making it.

3289
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:35,760
But I was raised in the States from a very young age and can hardly even remember my mother's gayo pinto.

3290
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:36,440
Gayo pinto.

3291
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:43,460
Having to make chit-chat with that clueless bird lover in the so-called revolutionary was excruciating.

3292
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:51,440
And, clueless or not, I wanted to be especially careful around Cecile, the one who actually regarded that tape.

3293
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:52,700
She's got that women's intuition.

3294
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:57,900
Thankfully, Miller and his men seem to believe I mistook the tape I found for one my friend made.

3295
02:31:58,460 --> 02:32:01,400
In any case, one can never be too careful.

3296
02:32:02,140 --> 02:32:07,820
Anyway, the three of us minced garlic and herbs, then cooked them in a pot with frijoles sweet-soaked overnight.

3297
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:13,180
While waiting for them to cook, we sauteed onions and arroz in a frying pan.

3298
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:24,580
Cecile worked the frying pan according to Amanda's directions, And then you remember at the end of Peace Walker passed as he remembered, or he knew everything about pies.

3299
02:32:24,580 --> 02:32:27,620
We added water to the pan and watched the arroz begin to steam.

3300
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:29,300
And so it just makes it even more like...

3301
02:32:29,300 --> 02:32:32,260
While we waited, Amanda shared memories of her mother with us.

3302
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:39,640
They had been separated because of samosa, but the taste of her mother's cooking was still fresh in her mind.

3303
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:45,320
When the frijoles were ready, we drained the water, stir-frying them with the rest of the vegetables.

3304
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:48,200
Quite a complicated process for home cooking.

3305
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:51,320
Nonetheless, it kept them occupied.

3306
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,440
He was playing there?

3307
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:54,940
Kaz is extremely manipulative.

3308
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:57,420
That guy is kind of crazy.

3309
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:01,480
The only thing he has going for him is that he's charismatic.

3310
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:03,840
Like, Kaz is actually insane.

3311
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:05,740
I mean, the guy is really fucking crazy.

3312
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:10,780
We folded it into the frijoles and added salsa, stirring the mixture as it simmered.

3313
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:15,240
At this point, for some reason, the conversation turned to romance.

3314
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:19,240
Why does it have to be that way whenever women get together and chat?

3315
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:25,920
Cecile fancies herself to be well-versed in such matters and gave Amanda all sorts of advice.

3316
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:33,680
It was harmless enough until, to my irritation, she began pestering me whether there was anybody I liked.

3317
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:36,940
Not right now, I said, trying to dodge the question.

3318
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:38,740
But she pressed on.

3319
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:40,720
It's Snake, isn't it?

3320
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:43,440
I gritted my teeth and played it coy.

3321
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:44,840
Maybe.

3322
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:45,900
Maybe.

3323
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:46,120
Maybe.

3324
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,280
Cecile nodded and jiggled.

3325
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:49,280
He is pretty sexy, isn't he?

3326
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:50,780
What a ditz.

3327
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:53,200
It's all I can manage to just survive.

3328
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:55,980
The thought of romance has never once crossed my mind.

3329
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:58,300
I have no interest in that kind of man.

3330
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:03,420
Soon enough, a rich aroma began to fill the room.

3331
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:05,600
The guy has been torn already.

3332
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:06,500
Yeah!

3333
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:10,560
Nu came over and rubbed up against our legs, looking for a handout.

3334
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:14,300
Unfortunately, it was not the kind of food a cat would like.

3335
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:15,100
Sure, Jan.

3336
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:19,500
We let a few of the soldiers have a bite, and then headed off to the mess hall.

3337
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:25,100
The home-cooked flavor we achieved was a big hit with the men of MSF.

3338
02:34:25,160 --> 02:34:25,500
Yay!

3339
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:27,860
Not that we are trying to arrest them or anything.

3340
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:30,280
Even I could manage a dish like that.

3341
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:32,220
Snake enjoyed it too.

3342
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:35,280
Let me make this absolutely clear.

3343
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:38,420
I have no interest in that man.

3344
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,080
We'll keep playing, I just wanted to pause a little bit.

3345
02:34:47,080 --> 02:34:48,620
I have, let me make it clear.

3346
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:51,280
I have no interest in that man.

3347
02:34:58,610 --> 02:35:00,870
Is pause sure she's not a teenager?

3348
02:35:01,070 --> 02:35:02,510
The edginess says other one.

3349
02:35:02,690 --> 02:35:07,550
She's so like, she tries so hard to be, to be so bad.

3350
02:35:07,730 --> 02:35:19,490
But one thing I wanted to say was, um, loving Metal Gear is accepting that literally everyone in this series is, is dog shit.

3351
02:35:19,490 --> 02:35:22,490
Everybody sucks, except Sunny.

3352
02:35:23,210 --> 02:35:29,750
But, loving Metal Gear is realizing that everyone is kind of awful, and just accepting that.

3353
02:35:34,130 --> 02:35:39,670
So, you know, when it's just like, yeah, Kaz is an actual psycho.

3354
02:35:39,670 --> 02:35:42,050
I, of course, I mean it lovingly.

3355
02:35:44,290 --> 02:35:46,710
Of course, I mean it lovingly.

3356
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:47,970
Otacon too?

3357
02:35:48,150 --> 02:35:49,570
Otacon is not innocent.

3358
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:51,850
He, he literally created Rex.

3359
02:35:53,870 --> 02:35:58,250
Sure, he's not as much of a crazy as everybody else.

3360
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,390
But like...

3361
02:36:07,070 --> 02:36:09,950
Anyway, this is Raiden's slander.

3362
02:36:13,630 --> 02:36:17,650
Raiden's tummy is too full of gunpowder for him to be wrong.

3363
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:25,550
Football, or soccer as it is known in the states, is extremely popular here.

3364
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:32,330
It has not caught on yet in the U.S., but it has legions of rabbit fans all across Latin America.

3365
02:36:32,970 --> 02:36:43,450
These fans can get so rowdy that it is commonly believed El Salvador and Honduras went to war in 1969 over scoffles in a soccer match.

3366
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:48,510
In reality, tensions between the two countries were already high.

3367
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:52,070
The match was merely one of the sparks that set them off.

3368
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:57,430
But these people are so passionate about this sport that the story seems plausible.

3369
02:36:58,270 --> 02:37:00,810
Predictably, many of the soldiers here are fans.

3370
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:06,910
They have apparently divided themselves into the Costa Rican and Nicaraguan teams and started playing each other.

3371
02:37:07,090 --> 02:37:07,510
I love to hate Huey.

3372
02:37:07,610 --> 02:37:10,030
To play, you need a ball and two goals.

3373
02:37:10,610 --> 02:37:13,030
Is she explaining soccer?

3374
02:37:13,970 --> 02:37:19,910
I had absolutely no interest, but Chico insisted that I come and watch.

3375
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:23,170
It was not a proper match by any means.

3376
02:37:23,250 --> 02:37:25,590
The pitch was not even regulation size.

3377
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:29,510
But the players and spectators alike got pretty excited.

3378
02:37:30,210 --> 02:37:34,010
They banged empty cans and shouted cheers through the handmade megaphones.

3379
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:34,690
I love these guys.

3380
02:37:34,690 --> 02:37:36,490
It almost felt like carnival.

3381
02:37:36,730 --> 02:37:37,670
I love these guys.

3382
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:40,970
Huey, the referee, blew a whistle to start the match.

3383
02:37:40,970 --> 02:37:45,250
The soldiers' training has left them in excellent physical shape.

3384
02:37:45,690 --> 02:37:50,570
But they lacked the honed skills of professionals and their play was quite rough.

3385
02:37:51,450 --> 02:37:54,530
Midway through, one of the men collided with another.

3386
02:37:54,870 --> 02:37:58,550
They started shouting at one another, but Huey stepped in.

3387
02:37:58,730 --> 02:38:00,070
Aw, Huey rolled in.

3388
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:01,470
We have forsaken our countries.

3389
02:38:01,710 --> 02:38:04,670
Become one with the earth, he said, quoting Snake.

3390
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:10,350
We are not competing for national pride here, and we are not fighting for the good of any one country.

3391
02:38:11,010 --> 02:38:12,370
This is not a war.

3392
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:14,750
Soccer is a peaceful sport, am I right?

3393
02:38:15,450 --> 02:38:16,650
The soldiers nodded.

3394
02:38:16,850 --> 02:38:20,450
They know the pain of war, and they share Snake's vision.

3395
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:23,650
Perhaps that is why all this resonates with them.

3396
02:38:23,910 --> 02:38:26,150
Nah, who each did nothing wrong?

3397
02:38:26,150 --> 02:38:29,350
And somehow, I was picked to fill in.

3398
02:38:29,770 --> 02:38:32,570
Costa Rica had the advantage up until that point.

3399
02:38:33,330 --> 02:38:35,290
I suppose Huey wanted to keep it balanced.

3400
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:37,930
These soldiers agreed with Huey's call.

3401
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:42,490
Maybe the Costa Rican players felt an even match-up would be more fun, too.

3402
02:38:42,970 --> 02:38:45,170
I could not be bothered to run at first.

3403
02:38:45,750 --> 02:38:50,610
But chasing the ball out there in the hot sun, I was soon drenched in sweat.

3404
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:56,510
Before long, I found myself actively seeking out the ball, partially out of desperation.

3405
02:38:57,190 --> 02:39:00,390
I picked up a loose ball deep on the opponent's side of the field.

3406
02:39:01,050 --> 02:39:04,510
Even though he's Nicaraguan, Chico cheered me on, yelling, What do you mean, picked it up?

3407
02:39:04,730 --> 02:39:05,510
Come for it, shoot!

3408
02:39:05,950 --> 02:39:06,750
With your hands?

3409
02:39:06,910 --> 02:39:11,270
I launched the ball, as hard as I could, only to have it blocked by the keeper.

3410
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:14,010
This appointment only increased my determination.

3411
02:39:14,710 --> 02:39:19,810
In the end, I didn't score a single goal, and Costa Rica gave up its lead.

3412
02:39:20,070 --> 02:39:21,530
It was really close, though.

3413
02:39:22,250 --> 02:39:24,550
We congratulated each other on a good match, and sprawled out in the shade on the deck.

3414
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:27,950
She's sending me to zero, because if she's explaining soccer to a British guy...

3415
02:39:27,950 --> 02:39:28,350
...and sprawled out in the shade on the deck, exhausted.

3416
02:39:29,330 --> 02:39:32,750
The ocean breeze felt so nice on my son's soft body.

3417
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:39,470
Nuke came over, it is one of his favorite spots, and stretched out next to me.

3418
02:39:39,530 --> 02:39:43,170
Huey refereeing a game where people are constantly using their legs is some funny irony.

3419
02:39:43,170 --> 02:39:46,050
...drift lazily across the clear blue sky.

3420
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:54,250
It was lovely out today, so I decided to sun myself in a lounge chair up on the deck...

3421
02:39:54,250 --> 02:39:55,410
Wait, is this the one with strange love?

3422
02:39:55,570 --> 02:39:57,010
...when strange love came up to me.

3423
02:39:57,850 --> 02:40:02,170
Despite the need, she was in her usual long sleeves and pants.

3424
02:40:02,690 --> 02:40:03,930
I waved at her.

3425
02:40:04,450 --> 02:40:08,090
She looked away and mumbled, H-hello there.

3426
02:40:08,450 --> 02:40:09,890
Fancy meeting you here.

3427
02:40:10,850 --> 02:40:12,810
I asked if she needed anything.

3428
02:40:13,470 --> 02:40:18,830
Feeling her eyes creeping up and down my body like she was savoring it.

3429
02:40:19,990 --> 02:40:25,790
Finally, she swallowed and said, You have such beautiful skin.

3430
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:30,930
Bewildered, I shook my head and said, No, not at all.

3431
02:40:31,610 --> 02:40:35,290
I had heard rumors that she was a lesbian.

3432
02:40:36,030 --> 02:40:39,410
Oh, she couldn't be after me, could she?

3433
02:40:40,570 --> 02:40:43,670
She continued to stare and said, No.

3434
02:40:43,890 --> 02:40:45,770
So she doesn't see Huey as a man.

3435
02:40:46,090 --> 02:40:48,770
But you must not let yourself get so tanned.

3436
02:40:49,150 --> 02:40:49,610
That's true.

3437
02:40:49,770 --> 02:40:51,090
And then she took my hand in her eyes.

3438
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:51,630
That's true, that's true.

3439
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:56,790
What is wrong with a little son, I asked, trying to cut the conversation short.

3440
02:40:56,970 --> 02:40:57,650
The L word.

3441
02:40:57,770 --> 02:40:59,250
But she shook her head violently.

3442
02:40:59,710 --> 02:41:01,130
No, you mustn't.

3443
02:41:01,270 --> 02:41:03,790
A young lady should take better care of her skin.

3444
02:41:03,790 --> 02:41:07,030
She was acting strangely now.

3445
02:41:07,150 --> 02:41:08,110
Say Gex.

3446
02:41:08,330 --> 02:41:08,810
As if aroused.

3447
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:09,850
Say Gex right now.

3448
02:41:09,970 --> 02:41:17,170
She lectured me on the perils of tanning, how it ages skin, causing wrinkles and spots, and in the worst cases, even...

3449
02:41:17,170 --> 02:41:18,430
She's so ahead of her time.

3450
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:20,210
I knew already that...

3451
02:41:20,210 --> 02:41:20,550
Gex!

3452
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:24,810
...but I thought only pale-skinned Anglo-Saxons had to deal with that.

3453
02:41:25,630 --> 02:41:30,150
Having a scientist tell me it causes aging, though, that spooked me a little.

3454
02:41:30,410 --> 02:41:31,990
Wear your sunscreen, everybody!

3455
02:41:32,090 --> 02:41:36,110
If I have to keep playing the teenager, I will have to start paying more attention to my skin.

3456
02:41:37,810 --> 02:41:41,490
Sensing my anxiety, she took a small tube from her pocket.

3457
02:41:42,010 --> 02:41:44,950
She said it was the sunscreen she always used.

3458
02:41:45,550 --> 02:41:46,930
She told me to keep it.

3459
02:41:47,330 --> 02:41:48,670
I didn't know what to say.

3460
02:41:48,670 --> 02:41:49,710
I mean, you could help me.

3461
02:41:49,790 --> 02:41:50,450
I can't reach my back!

3462
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:51,690
I was more than happy to take it, but...

3463
02:41:51,690 --> 02:41:52,830
A Doctor Strange, love!

3464
02:41:52,830 --> 02:41:53,930
Exactly what were her intentions?

3465
02:41:54,050 --> 02:41:54,690
Could you please?

3466
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:56,810
Was she merely being nice?

3467
02:41:57,490 --> 02:41:59,390
Or is she really into me?

3468
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:00,270
Pies!

3469
02:42:00,630 --> 02:42:03,930
Either way, there was no reason to refuse, I suppose.

3470
02:42:04,850 --> 02:42:06,310
I have undergone training.

3471
02:42:06,570 --> 02:42:09,690
An out-of-shape woman does not pose any real threat to me.

3472
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:10,750
My god, he's so rude!

3473
02:42:10,750 --> 02:42:12,110
Having power means not being afraid.

3474
02:42:12,370 --> 02:42:14,150
It is the same on a global scale.

3475
02:42:14,910 --> 02:42:15,950
A country we think...

3476
02:42:15,950 --> 02:42:16,510
Out-of-shape woman.

3477
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:18,650
...can dictate terms to a country without them.

3478
02:42:18,650 --> 02:42:19,590
She has a great party.

3479
02:42:19,790 --> 02:42:21,250
I thanked her and took the tube.

3480
02:42:21,750 --> 02:42:23,750
Then she offered to put some on for me.

3481
02:42:24,150 --> 02:42:28,530
She squirted some lotion onto her fingers and began robbing it into my chest.

3482
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:29,430
Into the chest?!

3483
02:42:29,430 --> 02:42:34,330
It happened so suddenly, and I was so taken aback that I did not even think to protest.

3484
02:42:34,330 --> 02:42:43,070
She caressed my stomach with her long white fingers, then slid them upwards between my bikini-clad breasts.

3485
02:42:44,470 --> 02:42:44,770
What?

3486
02:42:45,190 --> 02:42:47,270
Wait, I spotted as her moist eyes...

3487
02:42:47,270 --> 02:42:48,770
It's like she's reading fanfiction.

3488
02:42:48,770 --> 02:42:51,290
She was beautiful.

3489
02:42:52,590 --> 02:42:58,490
Somehow, I found myself captivated by this woman more than 10 years my elder.

3490
02:42:59,610 --> 02:43:00,530
Hold still.

3491
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:02,630
She whispered in my ear.

3492
02:43:02,730 --> 02:43:03,050
My god.

3493
02:43:03,810 --> 02:43:06,890
I nodded silently, unable to refuse.

3494
02:43:06,890 --> 02:43:13,150
My body went limp, motionless, as if in a trance.

3495
02:43:14,030 --> 02:43:21,350
Gently, carefully, she rubbed the lotion all over my entire body.

3496
02:43:21,550 --> 02:43:22,830
Or she gets the hose again.

3497
02:43:22,830 --> 02:43:27,750
I shouldn't have enjoyed it, and yet, I could not help myself.

3498
02:43:28,170 --> 02:43:31,790
For a moment, I was spellbound.

3499
02:43:33,290 --> 02:43:34,710
That woman is dangerous.

3500
02:43:35,470 --> 02:43:37,410
I had better watch myself.

3501
02:43:48,050 --> 02:43:50,070
Let's just take a moment to...

3502
02:43:56,030 --> 02:43:57,630
You could...

3503
02:43:57,630 --> 02:44:03,630
I'm listening to one of her spicy audio books on stream.

3504
02:44:03,830 --> 02:44:04,410
No, no!

3505
02:44:06,270 --> 02:44:07,350
No, no!

3506
02:44:07,890 --> 02:44:09,410
What I listen to...

3507
02:44:09,410 --> 02:44:10,330
That is...

3508
02:44:10,330 --> 02:44:14,930
That is like a hundred times more sensual than anything that I listen to.

3509
02:44:17,450 --> 02:44:19,330
A moment of appreciation.

3510
02:44:23,330 --> 02:44:24,050
Um...

3511
02:44:24,050 --> 02:44:25,130
Golly.

3512
02:44:27,630 --> 02:44:29,470
Fifty shades of eyes.

3513
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:31,910
I cannot think of my cat, though.

3514
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:36,550
Oh, wow.

3515
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:37,670
Just wow.

3516
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:48,140
It's not even like the...

3517
02:44:48,140 --> 02:44:50,920
Like, the pride flag question mark.

3518
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:51,780
It's just...

3519
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:54,780
Pride flag, exclamation, exclamation, exclamation.

3520
02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:00,200
This is the tape your mom walks in on you listening to.

3521
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:01,420
When you're playing this game...

3522
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:02,180
You could tell.

3523
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:02,960
She's like...

3524
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:04,260
When she's like talking...

3525
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:04,840
She's like...

3526
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:06,860
When she's like recounting the story in the...

3527
02:45:06,860 --> 02:45:08,080
In the tape, she's like...

3528
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:08,400
She's...

3529
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:09,540
She's imagining...

3530
02:45:09,540 --> 02:45:10,920
She's remembering everything.

3531
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:12,600
Not safe for when.

3532
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:14,620
I'm just...

3533
02:45:14,920 --> 02:45:16,380
Games are great, but streams...

3534
02:45:16,380 --> 02:45:18,400
Your streams always raise it to another level.

3535
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:19,840
Thank you, Dwarco.

3536
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:22,700
Thank you so much...

3537
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:23,080
For the...

3538
02:45:23,080 --> 02:45:23,820
For the...

3539
02:45:23,820 --> 02:45:23,840
For the...

3540
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:24,760
Thank you.

3541
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:28,100
Yeah, she's remembering it.

3542
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:29,880
Wait a minute.

3543
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:31,240
She sent this to Zero, right?

3544
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:32,040
I don't think so.

3545
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:33,220
I think these are just...

3546
02:45:33,220 --> 02:45:34,640
Since they're diary entries...

3547
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:36,120
I think they're just for her.

3548
02:45:37,220 --> 02:45:39,580
She really wanted to remember that moment.

3549
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:45,180
Imagine another timeline where MGS focused on Yuri instead of Yaoi.

3550
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:49,400
This is like the little Yuri crumb we get.

3551
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:51,100
But actually, it's like...

3552
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:52,700
That was...

3553
02:45:53,740 --> 02:45:55,500
That was probably...

3554
02:45:55,500 --> 02:45:56,600
That was like...

3555
02:45:56,600 --> 02:45:57,600
I mean, you know...

3556
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:59,420
Everything else in Metal Gear...

3557
02:45:59,420 --> 02:45:59,960
You know...

3558
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:04,000
If you...

3559
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:04,980
You...

3560
02:46:04,980 --> 02:46:06,880
It's not so overt...

3561
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:08,480
Where it's like...

3562
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:10,780
100% confirmed...

3563
02:46:10,780 --> 02:46:11,100
You know?

3564
02:46:11,740 --> 02:46:12,800
I mean...

3565
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:13,300
You know what I mean.

3566
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:14,040
You know what I mean.

3567
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:16,360
But this...

3568
02:46:16,980 --> 02:46:18,460
This is explicit.

3569
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:20,680
This is like...

3570
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:23,520
There's no denying.

3571
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:29,880
This happened.

3572
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:30,820
This...

3573
02:46:30,820 --> 02:46:31,820
You can't deny...

3574
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:32,480
You can't...

3575
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:33,840
You literally can't deny this.

3576
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:34,740
But also...

3577
02:46:34,740 --> 02:46:38,160
What makes me laugh so much about it more is just like...

3578
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:39,780
Strangelove is so...

3579
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:40,900
She's so gay.

3580
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:41,980
And yet...

3581
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:43,640
And yet...

3582
02:46:44,380 --> 02:46:45,820
I don't think she sees...

3583
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:47,900
Huey as a man at all.

3584
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:49,740
Which is just also hilarious.

3585
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:53,260
Oh yeah, that's true.

3586
02:46:53,400 --> 02:46:54,000
There is Vulcan.

3587
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:54,640
That is true.

3588
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:56,560
That's probably the most overt we get...

3589
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:57,780
On the yaoi end, huh?

3590
02:46:59,340 --> 02:46:59,980
Yeah...

3591
02:46:59,980 --> 02:47:00,560
That's true.

3592
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:02,660
Heheheheh...

3593
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:02,980
Heheheheh...

3594
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:04,640
Heheheheh...

3595
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:04,700
Heheheheh...

3596
02:47:04,700 --> 02:47:05,420
Heheheheh...

3597
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:05,800
Heheheheh...

3598
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:06,860
Heheheheh...

3599
02:47:06,860 --> 02:47:06,920
Heheheheh...

3600
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:10,380
Protecting one's health is an important part of any agent's job.

3601
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:12,720
But despite my best efforts...

3602
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:13,860
I have caught a cold.

3603
02:47:14,280 --> 02:47:14,820
Awww...

3604
02:47:14,820 --> 02:47:16,240
Now that I think about it...

3605
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:18,020
Mother Base's numbers are on the rise.

3606
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:21,460
With soldiers coming from all different places and backgrounds.

3607
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:23,400
Oh yeah, Vamp is canonically bi.

3608
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:24,420
You're right, you're right.

3609
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:25,040
You're right, you're right.

3610
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:26,380
Someone would bring in a virus.

3611
02:47:26,620 --> 02:47:27,040
You're right, you're right.

3612
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:27,480
You guys are right.

3613
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:30,420
That said, what I have got is just a common cold.

3614
02:47:31,140 --> 02:47:33,640
The medical team said I'd need a few days rest.

3615
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:36,840
So I've been restricted to my room and put on bed rest.

3616
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:40,960
I thought I'd gotten used to not having anyone around to relate to.

3617
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:42,720
I won't count the president with Ryden though.

3618
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:48,500
Because he thought Ryden was a pretty lady.

3619
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:50,440
Heheheheh...

3620
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:52,440
Trying to take my mind off how bad I felt.

3621
02:47:53,060 --> 02:47:55,900
Nuke just sat there, not making a sound.

3622
02:47:56,800 --> 02:47:58,340
But I did have visitors.

3623
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:06,680
Amanda and Chico, Huey, Cecile, Biller, and a few of the soldiers I've become relatively close to.

3624
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:09,340
Amanda made me a soup with herbs.

3625
02:48:09,580 --> 02:48:10,600
She said we're good for a cold.

3626
02:48:10,600 --> 02:48:11,660
Everybody's coming to visit you!

3627
02:48:11,660 --> 02:48:12,980
Everybody loves you, Paz!

3628
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:15,840
I will sing you a lullaby, he said.

3629
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:20,420
Then broke out a guitar and sang some incomprehensible song in Japanese.

3630
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:25,340
I did not need to understand the lyrics to know he is an awful singer.

3631
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:28,860
Then he said, you know what is good for a cold?

3632
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:30,300
Suppositories!

3633
02:48:30,660 --> 02:48:31,840
Here, I'll show you.

3634
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:37,200
He began to take off his pants, so I blew my tissue box at him to make him go away.

3635
02:48:39,060 --> 02:48:43,720
Then, Strangelop showed up, saying she had some miracle Indian cure.

3636
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:47,220
It has got eucalyptus eggs stuck, she said.

3637
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:50,500
It works best if you rub it into your chest.

3638
02:48:50,940 --> 02:48:53,170
And then, she tried to take off my...

3639
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:54,240
Oh my god!

3640
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:56,820
Everyone is harassing this poor sick girl!

3641
02:48:56,820 --> 02:48:58,020
And then, I got rid of her.

3642
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:01,400
Chico brought me a little flower and a cup.

3643
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:02,660
That's one thing or next!

3644
02:49:02,660 --> 02:49:07,700
He had been growing in a little bit of earth that probably found its way on board stuck to something else.

3645
02:49:07,780 --> 02:49:08,520
Hello, HR?

3646
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:10,240
I found this on the deck.

3647
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:12,340
Here, you can have it.

3648
02:49:12,500 --> 02:49:13,440
Mother base needs HR.

3649
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:17,500
He tried to act nonchalant, but I'm pretty sure you've got a crush on me.

3650
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:17,980
Cute.

3651
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:19,800
None of them understand.

3652
02:49:20,180 --> 02:49:24,580
If they thought these little visits would cheer me up, they were wrong.

3653
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:25,760
Oh my god.

3654
02:49:25,980 --> 02:49:26,920
Guys, please.

3655
02:49:27,380 --> 02:49:29,200
Tonight, Snake himself came to my room.

3656
02:49:29,700 --> 02:49:35,400
Like the rest, he believes I am just a school girl and treats me as such.

3657
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:38,060
Why did you abandon your country?

3658
02:49:38,060 --> 02:49:38,760
I asked him.

3659
02:49:39,280 --> 02:49:41,040
Why create the MSF?

3660
02:49:41,820 --> 02:49:46,880
Of course, I knew the answers already, but I wanted to hear it from him.

3661
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:51,080
As I had imagined, he was not exactly forthcoming.

3662
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:56,780
All he would say is that his country abandoned him, because all he could do was fight.

3663
02:49:57,140 --> 02:50:01,660
And that is why he needed the MSF, because that is all he is any good for.

3664
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:02,380
Oh no!

3665
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:10,060
Then he said, fighting is the only thing I understand, but that does not mean I have got a grudge against those who believe in peace.

3666
02:50:10,820 --> 02:50:14,200
I am not one of them, and I do not believe in peace.

3667
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:15,240
I do not believe in peace.

3668
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:16,820
Conflict is in man's nature.

3669
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:19,400
We fight our enemies in order to survive.

3670
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:24,040
Maybe we are not so different after all, he and I.

3671
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:30,280
But that is exactly why I'm going to have to kill him, or else he will have to kill me.

3672
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:39,920
When I stop and think about this wretched existence, being killed by a man like that, suddenly does not seem like such a bad thing.

3673
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,280
We have, uh, just four more, right?

3674
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:45,240
Yeah.

3675
02:50:45,640 --> 02:50:46,700
So seven, eight, nine, ten.

3676
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:47,660
Just four more entries.

3677
02:50:49,380 --> 02:50:54,500
Every month, Mother Base throws a party for all the soldiers whose birthdays fall in that month.

3678
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:59,060
There is something strange about a military organization having parties.

3679
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:03,400
Really though, it is just an excuse to drink and make noise.

3680
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:08,200
It is not easy to get alcohol in a fortress in the middle of the ocean.

3681
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:11,600
Most days they are training from dawn till dusk.

3682
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:13,920
They do not have time for things like drinking.

3683
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:19,700
That is why Snake and Miller came up with the idea, to give everyone a chance to let loose.

3684
02:51:20,920 --> 02:51:25,900
Obviously, a bunch of boars like that are not going to bother with blowing out candles on a cake.

3685
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:35,940
Rather, they sit there in a crowd of cigarette smoke, drink beer, eat meat, tell tasteless jokes, and swap crude themselves about one another's hometowns.

3686
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:39,000
But it hardly ever breaks out into something serious.

3687
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:42,060
They talk up a storm, but they're just having fun.

3688
02:51:42,340 --> 02:51:43,200
Yeah, they're little babies.

3689
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:43,760
It is funny.

3690
02:51:43,960 --> 02:51:51,400
You have got members of FSLN rubbing shoulders with the UCLA's, people who once would have considered the other mortal enemies.

3691
02:51:51,400 --> 02:51:53,380
That's what's so beautiful about MSF.

3692
02:51:53,380 --> 02:51:55,520
I wonder if that is what makes Big Boss so popular.

3693
02:51:56,400 --> 02:52:00,740
In leaving their countries behind, they leave their hatred for other countries too.

3694
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:03,260
Miller seemed a little protective of me.

3695
02:52:03,620 --> 02:52:05,720
Hope they're not being too crude, he said.

3696
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:08,420
But soon enough, he too was drunk.

3697
02:52:08,680 --> 02:52:12,660
He yelled, come here and take a look at the real Kazuhiro Miller.

3698
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:13,920
Is he going to take off his pants again?

3699
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:16,460
Then dropped his pants and mooned everybody.

3700
02:52:16,980 --> 02:52:18,880
The other soldiers burst out laughing.

3701
02:52:19,960 --> 02:52:23,660
I have never seen such a crude, ridiculous party before.

3702
02:52:24,480 --> 02:52:29,820
And yet, all these people laughing and acting the fool.

3703
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:31,760
Kazuhiro Miller is that type of drunk.

3704
02:52:31,980 --> 02:52:32,540
Is this what they call peace?

3705
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:34,560
How's this so funny?

3706
02:52:34,900 --> 02:52:38,180
For some reason, I began to think about all that has happened since I came here.

3707
02:52:39,100 --> 02:52:46,820
Fishing with Chico, cooking with Amanda and Cecile, playing soccer, having visitors when I caught it cold.

3708
02:52:47,580 --> 02:52:52,720
When I stop and think about it, my time here has been the most peaceful of my life.

3709
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:55,460
But that is about to end.

3710
02:52:56,180 --> 02:52:58,780
I cannot imagine he will be willing to negotiate.

3711
02:52:59,320 --> 02:53:02,100
It seems I am to fight the legendary big boss.

3712
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:05,620
I do not know if I'll be able to beat him.

3713
02:53:05,940 --> 02:53:10,960
But if I have to choose between death and defying cypher, I will gladly choose death.

3714
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:13,540
The thought of dying does not scare me.

3715
02:53:13,820 --> 02:53:19,740
But if I disobey my orders, the fear and despair awaiting me will be far worse than anything I can imagine.

3716
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:20,100
You just don't know after this.

3717
02:53:20,500 --> 02:53:22,740
It was Cypher who took me in as an orphan.

3718
02:53:23,060 --> 02:53:24,900
Gave me food and a place to live.

3719
02:53:25,580 --> 02:53:27,680
His orders may have been unreasonable.

3720
02:53:28,480 --> 02:53:30,860
But I will never repay my debt entirely.

3721
02:53:30,860 --> 02:53:33,560
It seems I have no choice.

3722
02:53:34,350 --> 02:53:35,880
I must fight this man.

3723
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:38,180
I must fight Snake.

3724
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:41,040
Nooooooo!

3725
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:43,600
Oh, thank you Minky Cosplayer.

3726
02:53:43,740 --> 02:53:45,400
I hope you had fun at the conventions today.

3727
02:53:45,540 --> 02:53:45,880
I did!

3728
02:53:46,180 --> 02:53:48,020
You should do meet and greets in Georgia, please.

3729
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:50,800
Minto meet and greet at AWA would be fire.

3730
02:53:51,980 --> 02:53:52,780
I... well...

3731
02:53:53,480 --> 02:53:55,280
It's really a matter of like...

3732
02:53:55,980 --> 02:53:58,200
I want to talk about it because it's uh...

3733
02:53:58,200 --> 02:53:59,860
Probably something else other people think about too.

3734
02:54:00,320 --> 02:54:01,260
It's not like it's...

3735
02:54:02,100 --> 02:54:04,380
It's... it's not so simple...

3736
02:54:04,380 --> 02:54:05,020
I suppose.

3737
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:06,720
It's really like a matter of...

3738
02:54:07,440 --> 02:54:09,320
If I'm a guest at the con...

3739
02:54:09,870 --> 02:54:12,020
You know, of course, I can do meet and greets that way.

3740
02:54:13,460 --> 02:54:18,120
So, if you have a place that you would want me to maybe try and go to...

3741
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:21,840
Then, you know, you could ask your local convention to uh...

3742
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:23,220
Invite your favorite VTuber.

3743
02:54:25,180 --> 02:54:25,600
So...

3744
02:54:26,500 --> 02:54:26,920
Um...

3745
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:29,540
Um...

3746
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:30,120
Or...

3747
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:31,680
It really like, you know, with this...

3748
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:32,760
It was Mosovox.

3749
02:54:32,900 --> 02:54:35,260
So, it's kind of if like uh...

3750
02:54:36,480 --> 02:54:36,900
If...

3751
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:37,960
If...

3752
02:54:37,960 --> 02:54:38,500
Uh...

3753
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:39,060
Uh...

3754
02:54:39,060 --> 02:54:40,640
Like some place that...

3755
02:54:40,640 --> 02:54:40,980
You know...

3756
02:54:40,980 --> 02:54:42,220
I have to be...

3757
02:54:42,220 --> 02:54:44,520
I was asked if I wanted to do...

3758
02:54:44,980 --> 02:54:45,420
The...

3759
02:54:45,420 --> 02:54:47,380
The one at Mosovox.

3760
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:48,200
So...

3761
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:48,700
Um...

3762
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:49,380
You know, if...

3763
02:54:49,380 --> 02:54:52,160
If there's not a place that is doing meet and greets...

3764
02:54:52,160 --> 02:54:53,320
Then it's kind of like uh...

3765
02:54:53,320 --> 02:54:54,660
Oh, I can't...

3766
02:54:54,660 --> 02:54:55,260
You know, I...

3767
02:54:55,260 --> 02:54:57,820
I mean, could maybe do like an unofficial one.

3768
02:54:57,980 --> 02:54:58,540
But it's...

3769
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:00,180
A little more difficult that way.

3770
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:01,120
So...

3771
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:01,760
Mmm...

3772
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:04,440
But hopefully, you know, I would love to do AWA.

3773
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:05,280
That's where...

3774
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:05,600
That's...

3775
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:08,240
That was the same con that we had the concert during.

3776
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:08,880
So...

3777
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:09,900
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

3778
02:55:11,500 --> 02:55:12,220
But um...

3779
02:55:12,220 --> 02:55:12,360
Yeah!

3780
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:13,420
So...

3781
02:55:13,420 --> 02:55:14,320
Uh...

3782
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:15,080
Just uh...

3783
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:16,760
Giving you a little bit of insight on it.

3784
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:18,560
But thank you!

3785
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:20,180
Thanks for coming to see me!

3786
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:23,860
Okay, number eight.

3787
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:25,020
Do you know Miller?

3788
02:55:25,620 --> 02:55:26,920
Snake's right-hand man.

3789
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:28,040
Oh, we know him.

3790
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:30,540
Apparently has got at least one serious weakness.

3791
02:55:30,820 --> 02:55:31,060
Women.

3792
02:55:31,460 --> 02:55:33,160
He is an insatiable womanizer.

3793
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:35,160
He does not bother me.

3794
02:55:35,160 --> 02:55:38,760
Most likely because he considers teenagers off limits.

3795
02:55:38,980 --> 02:55:39,200
Women.

3796
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:44,160
But he has hit on every single one of the few female soldiers here at Mother Base.

3797
02:55:44,260 --> 02:55:44,560
Oh yeah.

3798
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:46,820
They ought to be telling him where to stick it.

3799
02:55:46,840 --> 02:55:49,080
But end up falling for it so easily.

3800
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:50,780
I'm telling you, it's his charisma!

3801
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:52,900
He's literally got the riz.

3802
02:55:53,080 --> 02:55:54,340
And he's actually not that bad looking.

3803
02:55:54,540 --> 02:55:55,380
He's actually...

3804
02:55:55,380 --> 02:55:58,840
Anyway, today, that nasty habit got him in trouble.

3805
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:02,480
He and Snake got into one of their rare fights.

3806
02:56:02,660 --> 02:56:03,960
And I was there to...

3807
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:04,440
Shower.

3808
02:56:04,940 --> 02:56:09,060
They burst out of the showers completely naked, trading punches.

3809
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:10,860
I am no child.

3810
02:56:11,240 --> 02:56:13,440
The sight of a naked man does not make me blush.

3811
02:56:13,820 --> 02:56:15,840
But this was something else.

3812
02:56:16,580 --> 02:56:21,060
Maybe this will teach you, Snake yelled as he slammed his fists into Miller's chest.

3813
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,300
I heard later that apparently he had been too tiny.

3814
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:25,800
Ah!

3815
02:56:26,280 --> 02:56:26,760
Kazuhiro Miller!

3816
02:56:26,760 --> 02:56:28,820
And that same fellow had gone to Snake with her troubles.

3817
02:56:29,560 --> 02:56:31,900
As I see it, he's her own fault for ready.

3818
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:32,740
I'm sorry, hold on.

3819
02:56:32,820 --> 02:56:34,260
Can you imagine?

3820
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:41,920
Can you imagine some girl being like, Boss, I was in a relationship.

3821
02:56:41,960 --> 02:56:45,640
I thought I was in an exclusive relationship with Kazuhiro Miller.

3822
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:48,960
And then I find out that he's with...

3823
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:51,660
Horned...

3824
02:56:53,500 --> 02:56:54,520
Horned Lizard!

3825
02:56:55,220 --> 02:56:56,360
What do I do?

3826
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:57,100
And he's just like...

3827
02:57:01,860 --> 02:57:03,900
I'll go talk to him.

3828
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:09,840
What advice does this man have?

3829
02:57:20,980 --> 02:57:23,140
I'll go teach him a lesson.

3830
02:57:23,320 --> 02:57:23,800
Like this guy!

3831
02:57:24,100 --> 02:57:25,040
I can't imagine.

3832
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:27,680
I can't imagine a snake...

3833
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:33,660
A big boss peace walker snake literally having any advice.

3834
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:41,380
I guess he does kind of like talk to Chico and is like, You got a little crush on past, which is cute, but...

3835
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:48,580
Like a grown woman coming up to him being like, Kazuhiro Miller is cheating on me!

3836
02:57:49,060 --> 02:57:49,520
I don't know.

3837
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:49,910
It's like...

3838
02:57:50,840 --> 02:57:51,280
I don't know.

3839
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:52,320
I was...

3840
02:57:57,720 --> 02:57:58,560
Okay, sorry.

3841
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:00,400
I had to pause it because it's the...

3842
02:58:00,400 --> 02:58:01,320
The myth...

3843
02:58:01,320 --> 02:58:02,740
The image is too funny.

3844
02:58:03,260 --> 02:58:04,200
Be deceived like that.

3845
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:08,820
If she is too dumb to see through Miller's lies, then she got what she deserves.

3846
02:58:09,080 --> 02:58:09,300
Damn.

3847
02:58:09,540 --> 02:58:11,460
But this was not the first time that it happened.

3848
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:12,340
Or the second.

3849
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:14,760
And snake read Miller the riot act.

3850
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:16,440
Miller argued back.

3851
02:58:16,700 --> 02:58:18,460
And what began as a shouting match...

3852
02:58:18,460 --> 02:58:19,700
What are you arguing about?

3853
02:58:20,780 --> 02:58:23,240
You son of a bitch, Miller yelled as he swung.

3854
02:58:23,240 --> 02:58:24,620
You're in the wrong Miller!

3855
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:26,080
Not bad, said snake smiling.

3856
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:27,820
But not good enough.

3857
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:30,140
And then he was back on the offensive.

3858
02:58:30,340 --> 02:58:30,960
And they're naked.

3859
02:58:31,100 --> 02:58:31,960
All of all this is happening.

3860
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:33,240
They're setting it up.

3861
02:58:33,560 --> 02:58:35,480
And their bodies were covered with bruises.

3862
02:58:36,360 --> 02:58:38,740
Well, Arowana, the thing about love is...

3863
02:58:38,740 --> 02:58:40,900
Their bodies, deadly weapons.

3864
02:58:41,580 --> 02:58:44,080
They were each bleeding from a dozen places.

3865
02:58:44,320 --> 02:58:46,180
I'll speak to him in a language he understands.

3866
02:58:46,460 --> 02:58:47,640
Take some offense.

3867
02:58:47,640 --> 02:58:51,460
Even so, it was far less gruesome than if they had given it their all.

3868
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:55,660
It was obvious that one of them would be dead were they fighting for me.

3869
02:58:55,660 --> 02:58:57,120
And also, they're showering together.

3870
02:58:57,420 --> 02:58:59,780
I guess that's kind of normal in these vases.

3871
02:58:59,780 --> 02:59:00,820
Try this then!

3872
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,980
Snake parried, then responded in kindness.

3873
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:04,860
Gotta hit one with the mouth.

3874
02:59:04,900 --> 02:59:07,220
But I could tell he was not aiming for anything vital.

3875
02:59:07,900 --> 02:59:10,940
You are one tough bastard, boss, Miller muttered.

3876
02:59:11,260 --> 02:59:14,420
A smile crept across his face as he caught his breath.

3877
02:59:14,980 --> 02:59:16,760
And then they went right on fighting.

3878
02:59:16,980 --> 02:59:19,660
No, we can't do a watch along of Snake and Kai's at the sauna.

3879
02:59:20,360 --> 02:59:21,020
I will.

3880
02:59:21,240 --> 02:59:23,260
He was combat without hatred or hostile intent.

3881
02:59:23,480 --> 02:59:24,140
I will.

3882
02:59:24,140 --> 02:59:24,380
I can't.

3883
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:25,980
I can't do violence like this before.

3884
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:30,040
And yet, it was more than just a friendly tussle.

3885
02:59:30,220 --> 02:59:32,800
They were utilizing every technique they knew.

3886
02:59:33,400 --> 02:59:35,100
It was not a sporting match.

3887
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:36,840
They were not playing by the rules.

3888
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:38,700
How could they keep this up?

3889
02:59:38,920 --> 02:59:40,600
Paz, why are you noticing they're glistening?

3890
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:41,860
I know these details!

3891
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:44,220
And the bizarre scene came to an end.

3892
02:59:44,260 --> 02:59:45,660
Paz is a little part of Purcell.

3893
02:59:45,980 --> 02:59:47,180
They looked at each other's battered bodies.

3894
02:59:47,320 --> 02:59:48,120
Paz, you hear a Miller.

3895
02:59:48,460 --> 02:59:48,860
And then Purcell laughing.

3896
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:52,440
Embracing and congratulating each other on a good fight.

3897
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:54,700
You don't seem so idiotic.

3898
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:57,380
I still cannot fathom such behavior.

3899
02:59:57,380 --> 03:00:05,080
But somehow, I got the sense that for all his womanizing, Miller really only trusted one person.

3900
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:07,420
And that was Snake.

3901
03:00:08,520 --> 03:00:11,280
There was no way I could ever come between the two of them.

3902
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:16,940
And at that thought, I began to feel as if I had lost.

3903
03:00:17,580 --> 03:00:18,520
Lost what, Paz?

3904
03:00:18,900 --> 03:00:19,400
Lost what?

3905
03:00:20,180 --> 03:00:22,420
All of Mother Base is preparing for a festival.

3906
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:30,280
Since Snake and his soldiers spend so much time fighting, they are setting aside one day a year for peace and relaxation.

3907
03:00:31,640 --> 03:00:36,220
I do not know all the details, but apparently that is what Snake and Miller decided.

3908
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:38,880
These soldiers love the idea, of course.

3909
03:00:39,180 --> 03:00:44,040
There is so little fun to be had here that everybody looks forward to events like these.

3910
03:00:44,840 --> 03:00:46,240
That is so well and good.

3911
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:49,940
But somehow, I got roped into getting on stage.

3912
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:54,040
Come on, we even both have peace in our name, said Miller.

3913
03:00:54,740 --> 03:00:58,640
And Zadarna, that old Ruski's name, has something to do with peace too, right?

3914
03:00:59,220 --> 03:01:03,620
Hey, as long as we are having a day of peace, we ought to get an act together.

3915
03:01:03,920 --> 03:01:05,880
The Three-Piece Band.

3916
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:07,600
I thought he was joking.

3917
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:08,060
Oh, that hurts.

3918
03:01:08,380 --> 03:01:12,220
He then proceeded to share his idea without bothering to check with me.

3919
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:14,900
And now, I am slated to sing.

3920
03:01:15,940 --> 03:01:20,200
Apparently, he had heard me on the deck one day, and since then, he's wanted to form a band.

3921
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:22,040
Oh, what are you doing on the deck just singing, girl?

3922
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:23,660
Everybody's looking forward to it.

3923
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,960
So there is no way for me to back out now.

3924
03:01:26,620 --> 03:01:28,800
I have never done anything like this.

3925
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:29,900
Oh, neat.

3926
03:01:30,080 --> 03:01:33,600
But it does feel kind of nice to know that people are looking forward to it.

3927
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:37,500
I mean, it cannot be any worse than Miller's singing.

3928
03:01:38,240 --> 03:01:41,140
But modifications to Zeke are already finalized.

3929
03:01:41,400 --> 03:01:43,220
And I must complete my mission.

3930
03:01:44,100 --> 03:01:45,260
Betray Sai for now.

3931
03:01:45,700 --> 03:01:48,240
And I will face a fate far worse than death.

3932
03:01:48,500 --> 03:01:48,580
He's dead.

3933
03:01:50,060 --> 03:01:53,260
Still, there's no need to put things in motion just yet.

3934
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:56,900
What difference would it make you just wait a little while longer?

3935
03:01:57,100 --> 03:01:58,020
No, I sing all the time.

3936
03:01:58,020 --> 03:01:59,200
A whole day of peace.

3937
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:01,900
The mission can't wait until after that.

3938
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:03,680
Can it not?

3939
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:07,440
I know I'm only delaying the inevitable.

3940
03:02:08,480 --> 03:02:09,200
Where did it come?

3941
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:10,600
I like how this version's different from...

3942
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:11,920
One of us will have to die.

3943
03:02:13,360 --> 03:02:14,660
Snake, or me.

3944
03:02:15,320 --> 03:02:16,340
Of the one...

3945
03:02:16,340 --> 03:02:17,340
The cassette we have.

3946
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:20,440
If I could just come up with some way to stall Cypher.

3947
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:22,520
At least until our day of peace.

3948
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:26,540
When did I start having thoughts like this?

3949
03:02:28,860 --> 03:02:29,420
Ehhh...

3950
03:02:29,420 --> 03:02:31,020
My cover is blown.

3951
03:02:31,460 --> 03:02:34,080
They know nothing of Cypher or my true objective.

3952
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:35,960
But they know I am a spy.

3953
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:38,200
There is no more time left.

3954
03:02:38,700 --> 03:02:40,220
I must act now.

3955
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:42,500
I must complete my mission.

3956
03:02:43,560 --> 03:02:44,940
How did it come to this?

3957
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:45,780
Wait, uh, solely.

3958
03:02:45,980 --> 03:02:47,560
All I wanted was three more days.

3959
03:02:48,080 --> 03:02:49,180
Just three.

3960
03:02:50,020 --> 03:02:52,060
Miller's already finished writing the song.

3961
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:54,680
It is called love deterrent.

3962
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:58,940
It is about a girl who cannot express her true feelings.

3963
03:02:59,780 --> 03:03:01,000
I have been practicing.

3964
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:05,200
I am no pro, but I was pretty sure I would do a decent job.

3965
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:07,380
Not a music U is a pro, actually.

3966
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:10,640
Cypher found out that Zeke was complete.

3967
03:03:11,140 --> 03:03:14,040
He must have someone inside Mother Base besides me.

3968
03:03:14,780 --> 03:03:17,220
Spinning his tightly wound web of control.

3969
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:19,780
Leaving no room for individual will.

3970
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:21,400
Typical.

3971
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:27,360
When they found out Zeke was complete, I was ordered to execute the operation immediately.

3972
03:03:28,140 --> 03:03:33,240
If I was going to enjoy just one day of peace, I had to ensure the plan could not move forward.

3973
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:36,160
I tried to sabotage Zeke.

3974
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:41,640
I thought by damaging the drive system, they would have no choice but to delay their plans.

3975
03:03:42,260 --> 03:03:45,920
I waited until midnight, and then snuck into the hangar.

3976
03:03:46,460 --> 03:03:48,920
There would be trouble if it looked like sabotage.

3977
03:03:49,640 --> 03:03:55,120
I selected one of the drive system's load-bearing parts, and carefully worked to warp its shape.

3978
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:59,480
The legs drive system requires a high degree of precision to operate.

3979
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:02,220
Even the smallest deviation would have done it.

3980
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:04,920
Then, Chico walked in.

3981
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:06,400
Chico...

3982
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:08,600
Maybe it was one of those nights where he could not sleep.

3983
03:04:09,360 --> 03:04:13,960
In any case, he saw me, panicked, and took off running.

3984
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:15,020
Chico...

3985
03:04:15,020 --> 03:04:16,880
It would have been easy to kill him.

3986
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:18,500
But I could not.

3987
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:21,600
I know he likes me.

3988
03:04:21,660 --> 03:04:22,880
He's just a little baby.

3989
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:26,100
It is not as if I would ever have an interest in a child like him.

3990
03:04:26,480 --> 03:04:28,060
But I could not pull the trigger.

3991
03:04:28,700 --> 03:04:29,380
Not at him.

3992
03:04:29,860 --> 03:04:30,620
Not in the back.

3993
03:04:31,680 --> 03:04:32,480
Will he tell them?

3994
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:35,560
Or is there a chance he will keep it a secret?

3995
03:04:36,140 --> 03:04:36,940
Protect me.

3996
03:04:38,120 --> 03:04:38,620
No.

3997
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:40,600
He knows now.

3998
03:04:41,400 --> 03:04:43,340
Knows I am not who he thought I was.

3999
03:04:44,080 --> 03:04:46,780
He ran without even questioning what I was doing.

4000
03:04:47,380 --> 03:04:49,200
There is no chance he does not know.

4001
03:04:49,720 --> 03:04:52,600
And soon, all I have built here will end.

4002
03:04:52,980 --> 03:04:58,380
And if Cypher has another agent among them, If he finds out, I tried to sabotage Zeke.

4003
03:04:58,900 --> 03:05:01,200
This place will no longer be my heaven.

4004
03:05:02,780 --> 03:05:03,860
Then it is settled.

4005
03:05:04,580 --> 03:05:05,960
I make my move now.

4006
03:05:07,100 --> 03:05:09,600
Chico walked in before my sabotage was complete.

4007
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:11,940
So Zeke should still be operational.

4008
03:05:12,400 --> 03:05:14,480
It might not run at full speed or power.

4009
03:05:14,820 --> 03:05:16,760
But I do not have time to fix that.

4010
03:05:17,420 --> 03:05:20,560
Without Zeke, I do not have a chance in hell of winning.

4011
03:05:21,260 --> 03:05:23,740
I must act fast before Chico sounds the alarm.

4012
03:05:24,220 --> 03:05:26,060
I don't think Chico...

4013
03:05:26,060 --> 03:05:27,640
Chico wouldn't have done that.

4014
03:05:28,580 --> 03:05:29,900
He wouldn't have.

4015
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:32,180
I just did not think it would be so soon.

4016
03:05:36,320 --> 03:05:39,120
Chico would have given you a chance.

4017
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:42,040
Metal Gear Zeke, activate.

4018
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:48,500
The pause diaries.

4019
03:05:51,660 --> 03:05:53,020
I must act fast.

4020
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:54,060
Right after I record this.

4021
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:55,480
I was thinking that too.

4022
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:11,220
And then she took her clothes off?

4023
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:13,020
Yeah.

4024
03:06:13,680 --> 03:06:14,560
She didn't want them to...

4025
03:06:14,560 --> 03:06:17,140
You don't want them to get wet with the water.

4026
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:19,520
It would just...

4027
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:21,740
It would just make it harder to move.

4028
03:06:22,860 --> 03:06:24,240
It's the only reason.

4029
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:28,340
All righty.

4030
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:33,080
We've got one last mission to do.

4031
03:06:38,550 --> 03:06:39,530
Words and deeds.

4032
03:06:46,530 --> 03:06:49,430
By the way, Deja Vu missions encourages multiple plays.

4033
03:06:49,590 --> 03:06:51,270
So we'll leave it up to you on how to handle it.

4034
03:06:51,270 --> 03:06:52,350
We need guide info.

4035
03:06:52,550 --> 03:06:53,130
We're all on standby.

4036
03:06:53,270 --> 03:06:53,790
Thank you, Chico!

4037
03:06:54,370 --> 03:06:56,130
I think I might need some help.

4038
03:06:56,270 --> 03:06:57,970
I know where like some of like...

4039
03:06:58,630 --> 03:06:59,870
Some stuff is.

4040
03:07:02,950 --> 03:07:03,830
I know...

4041
03:07:03,830 --> 03:07:04,870
I know some stuff.

4042
03:07:06,430 --> 03:07:06,910
So...

4043
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:11,810
Only if I ask for a hint will we do the hint.

4044
03:07:12,030 --> 03:07:13,690
Well, I want a hint.

4045
03:07:14,070 --> 03:07:14,550
So...

4046
03:07:14,550 --> 03:07:14,670
Yeah!

4047
03:07:15,170 --> 03:07:16,190
Deja Vu is really cool.

4048
03:07:16,190 --> 03:07:16,990
So...

4049
03:07:16,990 --> 03:07:21,030
Recreate the strangely familiar scenes shown in the mysterious photographs.

4050
03:07:21,250 --> 03:07:22,390
And head for the gold.

4051
03:07:23,650 --> 03:07:24,710
Let's try it.

4052
03:07:28,770 --> 03:07:30,710
There's a lot of easter eggs beyond the objectives.

4053
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:31,350
Oh, is there?

4054
03:07:32,390 --> 03:07:35,740
I think actually I've only watched someone play this mission like...

4055
03:07:36,850 --> 03:07:38,510
Like very few times.

4056
03:07:38,730 --> 03:07:39,870
Like once or twice or something.

4057
03:07:40,010 --> 03:07:41,890
A long, long time ago before being like...

4058
03:07:41,890 --> 03:07:42,830
No, I want to...

4059
03:07:42,830 --> 03:07:45,410
So I don't remember so much of it.

4060
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:46,810
But I remember like, you know...

4061
03:07:46,810 --> 03:07:48,410
There's like some things that I'm like...

4062
03:07:48,410 --> 03:07:49,390
Ah, you know?

4063
03:07:51,750 --> 03:07:52,710
But it...

4064
03:07:53,610 --> 03:07:55,470
But for those who know...

4065
03:07:55,470 --> 03:07:56,590
Don't say anything, okay?

4066
03:07:58,410 --> 03:07:59,670
Don't say anything yet.

4067
03:08:02,030 --> 03:08:04,310
The easter eggs only pop up after completing the mission once.

4068
03:08:04,410 --> 03:08:04,610
Ah!

4069
03:08:04,870 --> 03:08:07,390
I do know one thing about like the guards.

4070
03:08:07,710 --> 03:08:08,490
Which is kind of fun.

4071
03:08:08,490 --> 03:08:09,070
Yeah!

4072
03:08:11,930 --> 03:08:13,110
What is that?

4073
03:08:15,790 --> 03:08:16,490
Yay!

4074
03:08:31,660 --> 03:08:33,380
Look, it's even the...

4075
03:08:33,380 --> 03:08:35,080
It's actually even the...

4076
03:08:35,730 --> 03:08:38,420
The picture on the title screen of Metal Gear Solid.

4077
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:39,260
Wahoo!

4078
03:08:40,300 --> 03:08:41,360
Kept you waiting, huh?

4079
03:08:41,500 --> 03:08:41,740
Ah!

4080
03:09:01,960 --> 03:09:02,660
Crazy.

4081
03:09:03,860 --> 03:09:04,940
Oh, we start here.

4082
03:09:04,940 --> 03:09:08,380
Boss, I've uploaded some photos to your eye droid.

4083
03:09:08,440 --> 03:09:09,120
Oh my god, hello?

4084
03:09:09,380 --> 03:09:11,300
Using those clues to find the locations they show.

4085
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:13,180
And recreate the scenes they depict.

4086
03:09:13,800 --> 03:09:15,000
We're counting on you, snake.

4087
03:09:15,460 --> 03:09:16,020
Commence date.

4088
03:09:16,320 --> 03:09:16,940
Oh, sorry.

4089
03:09:17,140 --> 03:09:18,700
A chopper and two sentries.

4090
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:22,540
A box and lights.

4091
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:24,400
Okay, I know where that one's a helipot.

4092
03:09:24,640 --> 03:09:27,560
A surveillance camera with a green light.

4093
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:30,740
Where could it be?

4094
03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:33,920
Oh, whoops, my bad.

4095
03:09:35,580 --> 03:09:36,520
A soldier?

4096
03:09:37,020 --> 03:09:37,980
And a tank?

4097
03:09:39,400 --> 03:09:40,280
A car.

4098
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:41,440
A car.

4099
03:09:42,940 --> 03:09:44,420
The last photo's missing.

4100
03:09:44,820 --> 03:09:45,740
Oh, sorry.

4101
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:46,860
I forgot it.

4102
03:09:47,280 --> 03:09:47,800
Okay.

4103
03:09:48,180 --> 03:09:50,000
Snake, it should be on the back of the disc case.

4104
03:09:50,360 --> 03:09:51,480
Or what about the manual?

4105
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:52,980
There's gotta be a clue somewhere.

4106
03:09:53,920 --> 03:09:54,880
The manual?

4107
03:09:55,220 --> 03:09:55,540
The log?

4108
03:09:55,740 --> 03:09:56,880
Not the log.

4109
03:09:57,720 --> 03:09:58,400
Maybe...

4110
03:09:59,880 --> 03:10:00,560
Here?

4111
03:10:01,940 --> 03:10:03,420
Is it under options?

4112
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:07,540
Support and legal information?

4113
03:10:09,700 --> 03:10:11,100
Wait, under where?

4114
03:10:17,070 --> 03:10:18,550
Check the manual.

4115
03:10:18,890 --> 03:10:20,130
Game settings, maybe.

4116
03:10:20,470 --> 03:10:20,730
No.

4117
03:10:21,650 --> 03:10:23,610
I want to keep reflex mode on.

4118
03:10:26,310 --> 03:10:28,050
Oh, under where?

4119
03:10:29,970 --> 03:10:31,370
Shut up.

4120
03:10:34,130 --> 03:10:34,850
Okay.

4121
03:10:37,410 --> 03:10:39,870
Actually, I don't know where that Moai...

4122
03:10:41,250 --> 03:10:43,270
Oh, my girl walks out!

4123
03:10:47,750 --> 03:10:49,130
Is this on Steam?

4124
03:10:49,370 --> 03:10:50,790
It might be a PDF manual.

4125
03:10:51,950 --> 03:10:52,570
Yes?

4126
03:10:52,890 --> 03:10:54,210
Shadow Moses Island.

4127
03:10:54,490 --> 03:10:56,890
A remote island off the coast of Alaska.

4128
03:10:59,370 --> 03:11:00,610
Or not.

4129
03:11:01,610 --> 03:11:03,350
Did you guys hear the wolf though?

4130
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:08,400
Good morning.

4131
03:11:09,880 --> 03:11:11,980
Good morning, sleeping beauty.

4132
03:11:21,780 --> 03:11:23,260
That's just a guy chilling.

4133
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:25,920
Where are the birds at?

4134
03:11:26,540 --> 03:11:29,000
I didn't even know you could mark animals in this game.

4135
03:11:31,740 --> 03:11:32,400
Let's see.

4136
03:11:32,880 --> 03:11:34,720
I don't know where the guys are in this.

4137
03:11:35,040 --> 03:11:35,460
Wait, how many?

4138
03:11:36,440 --> 03:11:39,660
I marked one, but did it say how many guys there were?

4139
03:11:45,120 --> 03:11:48,120
As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.

4140
03:11:48,120 --> 03:11:48,580
Yeah.

4141
03:11:48,740 --> 03:11:50,320
Weapons and equipment OSP.

4142
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:50,860
Wait, actually?

4143
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:52,560
This is a top secret black op.

4144
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:53,040
Oh!

4145
03:11:53,880 --> 03:11:55,360
Wait, wait, wait!

4146
03:11:55,740 --> 03:11:56,480
Wait a second!

4147
03:11:56,740 --> 03:11:57,680
I don't have anything.

4148
03:11:58,040 --> 03:11:58,820
Oh, shit!

4149
03:11:59,940 --> 03:12:01,120
I just noticed!

4150
03:12:02,820 --> 03:12:03,780
Kazuhiro Miller!

4151
03:12:04,460 --> 03:12:06,140
Why didn't you say that earlier?

4152
03:12:09,020 --> 03:12:10,100
Weapons OSP.

4153
03:12:12,480 --> 03:12:13,600
You didn't check?

4154
03:12:13,820 --> 03:12:14,260
I don't even...

4155
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:16,520
I'm just so used to starting with stuff.

4156
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:18,240
I don't even think about it.

4157
03:12:18,680 --> 03:12:20,320
There's gotta be something in here then, right?

4158
03:12:23,400 --> 03:12:23,940
No!

4159
03:12:24,460 --> 03:12:24,560
Oh!

4160
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:26,800
Goose Babble!

4161
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:32,460
Wow.

4162
03:12:34,040 --> 03:12:34,880
Ghost Babble.

4163
03:12:37,660 --> 03:12:38,360
Okay, good.

4164
03:12:38,420 --> 03:12:39,180
There's nobody up there.

4165
03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:42,580
Sometimes that guy can get you good.

4166
03:12:46,040 --> 03:12:47,120
Give him a little...

4167
03:12:47,120 --> 03:12:47,700
Whoa, whoa!

4168
03:12:47,840 --> 03:12:48,760
That bird scared me.

4169
03:12:53,130 --> 03:12:54,030
Can I get in there?

4170
03:12:54,870 --> 03:12:55,930
Is there anything in here?

4171
03:12:56,730 --> 03:12:57,730
Oh, a shotgun!

4172
03:12:58,230 --> 03:12:58,970
You know what?

4173
03:13:00,250 --> 03:13:00,590
Uh...

4174
03:13:01,230 --> 03:13:02,930
Better than nothing, I suppose.

4175
03:13:07,190 --> 03:13:08,630
Better than nothing.

4176
03:13:10,630 --> 03:13:12,990
I don't know if there's anybody in here, actually.

4177
03:13:16,270 --> 03:13:17,190
Didn't check.

4178
03:13:19,770 --> 03:13:21,610
Doesn't seem to be the case.

4179
03:13:23,630 --> 03:13:25,010
I'm just looking around.

4180
03:13:29,530 --> 03:13:30,250
Is this...

4181
03:13:30,250 --> 03:13:31,610
Oh, this is like regular prisoner.

4182
03:13:34,490 --> 03:13:35,850
Wait, we get a cutscene for this?

4183
03:13:37,370 --> 03:13:39,130
We can call Miller when looking at the titles.

4184
03:13:39,330 --> 03:13:39,650
Oh, okay.

4185
03:13:40,130 --> 03:13:42,170
If you see any logos, feel free to code at guys.

4186
03:13:42,350 --> 03:13:42,710
Oh, okay.

4187
03:13:43,250 --> 03:13:43,730
I will.

4188
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:49,220
Oh, no!

4189
03:13:49,880 --> 03:13:50,400
Oh, no!

4190
03:13:53,620 --> 03:13:53,980
Fox!

4191
03:14:06,990 --> 03:14:08,270
Oh, no!

4192
03:14:10,450 --> 03:14:11,690
Um, okay.

4193
03:14:12,090 --> 03:14:13,430
He's just like, that happened?

4194
03:14:14,690 --> 03:14:15,510
He's dead.

4195
03:14:15,850 --> 03:14:17,410
It looked like a heart attack.

4196
03:14:19,330 --> 03:14:20,410
Wait a second.

4197
03:14:22,010 --> 03:14:23,250
What do you mean, wait a second?

4198
03:14:25,430 --> 03:14:26,410
Complete your thoughts.

4199
03:14:27,170 --> 03:14:28,450
What do you mean, wait a second?

4200
03:14:31,110 --> 03:14:32,610
What do you mean, wait a second?

4201
03:14:34,210 --> 03:14:34,610
Where...

4202
03:14:34,610 --> 03:14:36,790
Is there any more guns besides the shotgun?

4203
03:14:37,030 --> 03:14:37,210
I...

4204
03:14:37,210 --> 03:14:37,890
I will...

4205
03:14:41,400 --> 03:14:42,200
Oh my god.

4206
03:14:42,400 --> 03:14:42,640
No.

4207
03:14:47,200 --> 03:14:48,900
Is there actually somebody in there?

4208
03:14:52,260 --> 03:14:53,420
Oh, gross.

4209
03:15:02,580 --> 03:15:03,580
No way!

4210
03:15:03,900 --> 03:15:04,920
No, thank you!

4211
03:15:05,620 --> 03:15:07,040
Wait, can we get him out of there?

4212
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:09,380
The Sasaki family legacy.

4213
03:15:11,380 --> 03:15:12,280
Oh my god.

4214
03:15:12,280 --> 03:15:13,300
It sounds horrible.

4215
03:15:13,820 --> 03:15:14,180
It sounds...

4216
03:15:14,180 --> 03:15:14,480
Wait.

4217
03:15:15,140 --> 03:15:15,520
Oh, I can't.

4218
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:16,060
Okay, nevermind.

4219
03:15:16,860 --> 03:15:18,520
Oh my god.

4220
03:15:18,520 --> 03:15:19,920
It sounds so bad.

4221
03:15:24,760 --> 03:15:26,420
It sounds terrible.

4222
03:15:29,950 --> 03:15:31,810
He's fighting for his life in there.

4223
03:15:31,890 --> 03:15:32,790
Truly, actually.

4224
03:15:33,970 --> 03:15:34,670
Let's see.

4225
03:15:34,810 --> 03:15:35,150
Hold on.

4226
03:15:39,430 --> 03:15:41,590
I like how you can hear the wolf sometimes.

4227
03:15:42,990 --> 03:15:44,490
Are you all right in there?

4228
03:15:44,950 --> 03:15:46,030
Someone's in the outhouse.

4229
03:15:46,590 --> 03:15:48,330
Some soldier with stomach trouble?

4230
03:15:48,430 --> 03:15:49,210
Yeah, no.

4231
03:15:49,530 --> 03:15:50,390
I think it's gonna be a while.

4232
03:15:50,750 --> 03:15:51,970
Better leave it alone.

4233
03:15:52,170 --> 03:15:52,370
No.

4234
03:15:52,890 --> 03:15:54,090
Oh my god.

4235
03:15:54,710 --> 03:15:56,830
No kidding, a man with stomach trouble.

4236
03:15:59,870 --> 03:16:01,210
He has to keep flushing.

4237
03:16:05,860 --> 03:16:06,960
Oh, I don't have any.

4238
03:16:08,660 --> 03:16:09,980
Oh, this is bad.

4239
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:11,620
Okay, hold on.

4240
03:16:11,680 --> 03:16:12,540
Maybe I can go around.

4241
03:16:14,500 --> 03:16:15,720
Maybe there's something in here.

4242
03:16:15,860 --> 03:16:16,720
Ouch, ouch, cactus.

4243
03:16:17,020 --> 03:16:17,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4244
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:19,420
What?

4245
03:16:19,560 --> 03:16:20,280
Where is everything?

4246
03:16:23,690 --> 03:16:25,630
I'm afraid that guy's gonna turn around.

4247
03:16:30,230 --> 03:16:32,030
The crows are ominous, huh?

4248
03:16:32,950 --> 03:16:34,330
I mean, the ravens.

4249
03:16:34,850 --> 03:16:36,230
Where's any weapons here?

4250
03:16:36,990 --> 03:16:40,170
Maybe I go to the armory and I can get something.

4251
03:16:42,510 --> 03:16:44,090
They don't just leave stuff lying around.

4252
03:16:44,170 --> 03:16:44,650
They did!

4253
03:16:44,970 --> 03:16:46,370
They did in the other missions.

4254
03:16:46,470 --> 03:16:47,210
What are you talking about?

4255
03:16:56,890 --> 03:16:59,030
I wish I could see how many people were...

4256
03:17:00,110 --> 03:17:00,510
On...

4257
03:17:00,510 --> 03:17:01,090
Oh, there's a guy.

4258
03:17:01,290 --> 03:17:01,930
Okay, now we can see.

4259
03:17:05,230 --> 03:17:05,630
What?

4260
03:17:06,130 --> 03:17:07,130
I didn't get a...

4261
03:17:07,690 --> 03:17:09,110
I marked him, but it didn't...

4262
03:17:09,110 --> 03:17:11,530
It didn't say marked blank out of blank.

4263
03:17:12,510 --> 03:17:13,390
Aw, man.

4264
03:17:20,180 --> 03:17:24,040
I like kind of having an idea of how many guys are on...

4265
03:17:24,040 --> 03:17:24,740
Around, but...

4266
03:17:26,440 --> 03:17:28,740
I guess this time we're just gonna have to...

4267
03:17:30,300 --> 03:17:31,420
Figure it out.

4268
03:17:33,720 --> 03:17:35,460
Can you still hold them up with a shotgun?

4269
03:17:36,380 --> 03:17:37,400
I just don't...

4270
03:17:37,400 --> 03:17:38,960
We only have not a lot of bullets.

4271
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:53,520
Mark?

4272
03:17:53,740 --> 03:17:55,120
The map has been updated.

4273
03:17:58,980 --> 03:17:59,460
Okay.

4274
03:18:00,460 --> 03:18:00,820
Oh, man.

4275
03:18:03,280 --> 03:18:06,000
Is there a car around here I can put you in?

4276
03:18:08,020 --> 03:18:10,840
Is there a car or anything around here I can...

4277
03:18:12,040 --> 03:18:13,640
I can drop you inside?

4278
03:18:14,540 --> 03:18:15,540
Maybe over here.

4279
03:18:16,140 --> 03:18:17,740
Hopefully there's no one else around.

4280
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:22,960
So, you got a marking.

4281
03:18:23,540 --> 03:18:24,800
Oh, there is someone else.

4282
03:18:28,540 --> 03:18:29,980
I'm just gonna put him in the grass.

4283
03:18:31,560 --> 03:18:32,280
One second.

4284
03:18:34,780 --> 03:18:36,780
I didn't want him waking up, but...

4285
03:18:36,780 --> 03:18:37,080
You know what?

4286
03:18:37,220 --> 03:18:37,840
Oh, that's fine.

4287
03:18:56,560 --> 03:18:57,940
Does this guy turn around?

4288
03:18:58,180 --> 03:18:58,620
Right?

4289
03:19:00,080 --> 03:19:00,420
Oh!

4290
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:01,600
Oh!

4291
03:19:01,880 --> 03:19:02,140
Oh!

4292
03:19:02,620 --> 03:19:03,900
We gotta go up there!

4293
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:07,580
I also hear another guy walking.

4294
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:08,120
Hold on.

4295
03:19:11,220 --> 03:19:12,000
This guy.

4296
03:19:12,900 --> 03:19:13,720
Yeah, I...

4297
03:19:13,720 --> 03:19:14,700
I heard him.

4298
03:19:16,080 --> 03:19:16,560
Kojima.

4299
03:19:16,780 --> 03:19:17,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4300
03:19:17,860 --> 03:19:19,260
We gotta use...

4301
03:19:19,260 --> 03:19:20,720
I know what we gotta do there.

4302
03:19:20,980 --> 03:19:21,240
It's kinda...

4303
03:19:21,240 --> 03:19:22,100
It's actually really cool.

4304
03:19:26,270 --> 03:19:27,590
Shoulda grabbed his gun.

4305
03:19:33,400 --> 03:19:34,360
Maybe you're right.

4306
03:19:35,440 --> 03:19:36,320
Where is it?

4307
03:19:39,120 --> 03:19:40,440
I think it was under the light.

4308
03:19:41,580 --> 03:19:42,460
Did he have one?

4309
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:45,660
Oh, yeah.

4310
03:19:47,460 --> 03:19:48,460
Oh, but I...

4311
03:19:48,460 --> 03:19:48,980
I...

4312
03:19:48,980 --> 03:19:50,120
Oh, but it has more...

4313
03:19:50,120 --> 03:19:51,980
I feel like the shotgun would be better...

4314
03:19:51,980 --> 03:19:53,820
Because it's stronger, but...

4315
03:19:53,820 --> 03:19:54,900
Eh, this has more ammo.

4316
03:19:56,200 --> 03:19:56,860
Mm-mm.

4317
03:20:01,330 --> 03:20:02,290
Mm-mm.

4318
03:20:04,970 --> 03:20:07,470
Trying not to get noticed by this guy.

4319
03:20:10,930 --> 03:20:17,510
I don't wanna be noticed by that guy over there either, but I'm afraid if I try to open the door, somebody's gonna notice me and I'll...

4320
03:20:18,030 --> 03:20:18,870
This one's kinda tricky.

4321
03:20:20,950 --> 03:20:22,650
Why don't I have a drink?

4322
03:20:22,890 --> 03:20:23,330
This sucks.

4323
03:20:36,070 --> 03:20:37,530
You got anything to say?

4324
03:20:39,210 --> 03:20:39,950
There's some...

4325
03:20:40,510 --> 03:20:42,210
The map has been updated.

4326
03:20:42,370 --> 03:20:42,710
Thank you.

4327
03:20:46,480 --> 03:20:47,680
Thank you, thank you.

4328
03:20:48,160 --> 03:20:48,680
Good to know.

4329
03:20:49,760 --> 03:20:50,700
Good to know.

4330
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:54,820
Can I put him in there?

4331
03:20:55,360 --> 03:20:55,840
Dang it.

4332
03:20:57,340 --> 03:20:58,000
Dang it.

4333
03:20:59,900 --> 03:21:00,880
Into the corner you go.

4334
03:21:05,140 --> 03:21:05,660
What?

4335
03:21:05,980 --> 03:21:06,700
Where though?

4336
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:09,480
The map has been updated.

4337
03:21:11,020 --> 03:21:11,680
What's this?

4338
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:13,560
Hand got all the way over there?

4339
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:16,860
Oh, I think this is the mark that...

4340
03:21:16,860 --> 03:21:17,260
Oh, whoops.

4341
03:21:17,320 --> 03:21:18,220
That guy was telling about.

4342
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:20,240
This.

4343
03:21:20,540 --> 03:21:21,920
Yeah, logo marking.

4344
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:29,660
You can wake him up and then immediately...

4345
03:21:29,660 --> 03:21:29,900
Oh.

4346
03:21:31,540 --> 03:21:32,060
True.

4347
03:21:35,180 --> 03:21:36,160
I'll try it.

4348
03:21:37,520 --> 03:21:41,080
Uh-oh.

4349
03:21:41,540 --> 03:21:41,840
Freeze.

4350
03:21:42,820 --> 03:21:43,840
Yeah, get down.

4351
03:21:44,940 --> 03:21:45,720
Get down.

4352
03:21:47,620 --> 03:21:48,480
Get down.

4353
03:21:52,530 --> 03:21:54,030
He's like stuck in the corner.

4354
03:21:55,550 --> 03:21:56,730
It's pretty good, actually.

4355
03:22:03,470 --> 03:22:04,030
Oh,

4356
03:22:10,580 --> 03:22:11,580
that sucks.

4357
03:22:12,200 --> 03:22:14,380
Oh, that sucks.

4358
03:22:14,920 --> 03:22:16,460
I forgot to tell him to get down.

4359
03:22:17,240 --> 03:22:18,000
Oh,

4360
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:25,000
the music though.

4361
03:22:35,070 --> 03:22:36,270
You'll just let him bleed out.

4362
03:22:47,940 --> 03:22:49,160
Yeah, screw that guy.

4363
03:23:07,890 --> 03:23:09,190
Oh, that's a magazine.

4364
03:23:09,370 --> 03:23:10,090
That's nice, at least.

4365
03:23:10,750 --> 03:23:13,550
You can try and distract people.

4366
03:23:19,140 --> 03:23:21,320
I hear footsteps, but I don't know where they are.

4367
03:23:21,920 --> 03:23:22,860
It's scaring me.

4368
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:26,840
Get out of there.

4369
03:23:26,940 --> 03:23:27,340
No, no.

4370
03:23:28,560 --> 03:23:29,780
This is actually pretty good.

4371
03:23:30,400 --> 03:23:31,580
I don't know where I am.

4372
03:23:42,340 --> 03:23:42,980
I don't know.

4373
03:23:47,780 --> 03:23:48,360
What the?

4374
03:23:50,940 --> 03:23:52,200
I'm working on it.

4375
03:23:52,240 --> 03:23:53,040
What do you mean fire?

4376
03:23:53,500 --> 03:23:54,420
Are they bugged?

4377
03:23:58,160 --> 03:23:59,600
Nope, they're... they're leaving.

4378
03:24:04,360 --> 03:24:05,100
Okay...

4379
03:24:08,740 --> 03:24:10,300
Oh, there's another guy there.

4380
03:24:12,040 --> 03:24:12,780
Nice.

4381
03:24:24,480 --> 03:24:24,980
Yep.

4382
03:24:41,940 --> 03:24:42,520
Yeah!

4383
03:24:44,380 --> 03:24:46,600
Kojima Productions.

4384
03:24:48,460 --> 03:24:50,340
Maybe now I can go into the armory.

4385
03:24:58,590 --> 03:24:59,630
Don't turn around.

4386
03:25:00,090 --> 03:25:00,430
Awesome.

4387
03:25:09,660 --> 03:25:10,860
Kojima Productions.

4388
03:25:11,800 --> 03:25:12,520
Hang grenade.

4389
03:25:12,720 --> 03:25:14,380
We'll take anything that we can get, I guess.

4390
03:25:14,660 --> 03:25:15,060
Oh, whoa.

4391
03:25:16,500 --> 03:25:17,100
Uh...

4392
03:25:17,100 --> 03:25:17,940
A sniper!

4393
03:25:19,420 --> 03:25:20,900
We could just take out everybody.

4394
03:25:21,840 --> 03:25:23,240
CP, this is Delta II.

4395
03:25:23,460 --> 03:25:25,100
We've checked the area and found nothing.

4396
03:25:25,660 --> 03:25:26,580
Calling off the search.

4397
03:25:26,820 --> 03:25:27,180
Over.

4398
03:25:27,300 --> 03:25:27,340
Nice!

4399
03:25:28,140 --> 03:25:29,000
This is CP.

4400
03:25:29,280 --> 03:25:29,520
Understood.

4401
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:30,680
Keep this hard up.

4402
03:25:30,800 --> 03:25:32,940
Does not have a lot of ammo, but...

4403
03:25:35,120 --> 03:25:35,540
Um...

4404
03:25:35,540 --> 03:25:36,420
I don't think there's...

4405
03:25:36,810 --> 03:25:38,660
I don't think there's...

4406
03:25:38,660 --> 03:25:39,860
Sorry, I'm just looking around.

4407
03:25:40,280 --> 03:25:40,700
Uh...

4408
03:25:40,700 --> 03:25:40,820
Yeah.

4409
03:25:44,420 --> 03:25:46,020
Is Deja Vu PC exclusive?

4410
03:25:46,220 --> 03:25:47,120
I don't know, actually.

4411
03:25:58,110 --> 03:25:58,630
Uh...

4412
03:25:58,630 --> 03:25:59,650
Will they know?

4413
03:26:04,110 --> 03:26:05,210
Oh, come on!

4414
03:26:06,490 --> 03:26:07,390
So unlucky.

4415
03:26:18,910 --> 03:26:20,750
The unlock requirement...

4416
03:26:20,750 --> 03:26:22,090
I don't remember what it is for this one.

4417
03:26:26,780 --> 03:26:28,120
CP, this is Zulu VI.

4418
03:26:28,420 --> 03:26:29,500
Unidentified gunfire.

4419
03:26:29,700 --> 03:26:30,940
Can't tell where it's coming from.

4420
03:26:31,300 --> 03:26:31,480
Over.

4421
03:26:32,740 --> 03:26:33,360
This is CP.

4422
03:26:33,620 --> 03:26:33,880
Understood.

4423
03:26:34,320 --> 03:26:35,180
We are under attack.

4424
03:26:35,540 --> 03:26:36,700
All units on alert.

4425
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:39,800
Oh, dang.

4426
03:26:40,460 --> 03:26:42,180
Maybe I can get him through the...

4427
03:26:47,750 --> 03:26:48,450
DELTA VI.

4428
03:26:48,610 --> 03:26:48,790
Nice.

4429
03:26:48,990 --> 03:26:50,350
We've got unidentified gunfire.

4430
03:26:50,590 --> 03:26:51,310
Location unknown.

4431
03:26:51,570 --> 03:26:52,030
Over.

4432
03:26:52,210 --> 03:26:52,930
Location unknown.

4433
03:26:53,630 --> 03:26:54,690
Where could he be?

4434
03:26:54,930 --> 03:26:54,950
This is CP.

4435
03:26:54,950 --> 03:26:57,510
Locate threat immediately and eliminate as necessary.

4436
03:26:57,690 --> 03:26:58,010
Out.

4437
03:26:58,590 --> 03:26:59,610
Where could he be?

4438
03:27:01,130 --> 03:27:02,490
I still have my other gun, yeah.

4439
03:27:07,370 --> 03:27:08,190
They're coming in.

4440
03:27:08,390 --> 03:27:09,550
And I will take them out.

4441
03:27:10,890 --> 03:27:11,430
Come on.

4442
03:27:12,630 --> 03:27:13,490
I don't care.

4443
03:27:13,630 --> 03:27:14,150
I don't care.

4444
03:27:15,650 --> 03:27:16,910
Guy's crying over there.

4445
03:27:16,970 --> 03:27:17,350
Are you alright?

4446
03:27:22,850 --> 03:27:23,670
Which way he's coming?

4447
03:27:30,280 --> 03:27:30,680
Bleed.

4448
03:27:31,160 --> 03:27:31,560
Bleed.

4449
03:27:33,960 --> 03:27:34,520
Bleed.

4450
03:27:34,700 --> 03:27:35,080
Bleed.

4451
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:35,500
Bleed.

4452
03:27:35,980 --> 03:27:36,540
Bleed.

4453
03:27:37,640 --> 03:27:38,200
CP.

4454
03:27:38,540 --> 03:27:39,220
This is Zulu II.

4455
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:40,560
Identified gunfire.

4456
03:27:41,100 --> 03:27:42,060
Can't tell where it's coming from.

4457
03:27:42,300 --> 03:27:42,600
Over.

4458
03:27:43,780 --> 03:27:44,460
This is CP.

4459
03:27:44,760 --> 03:27:44,980
Understood.

4460
03:27:45,460 --> 03:27:48,120
Locate threat immediately and eliminate as necessary.

4461
03:27:48,320 --> 03:27:48,560
Out.

4462
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:48,640
Okay.

4463
03:27:48,740 --> 03:27:49,320
I think we're good now.

4464
03:27:57,890 --> 03:27:58,610
Let's see.

4465
03:27:58,610 --> 03:27:58,950
Uh.

4466
03:27:59,170 --> 03:28:00,190
We gotta go...

4467
03:28:01,410 --> 03:28:02,450
Into the...

4468
03:28:02,450 --> 03:28:02,690
Oh.

4469
03:28:03,050 --> 03:28:03,790
What was that?

4470
03:28:08,700 --> 03:28:09,240
Oh.

4471
03:28:10,120 --> 03:28:10,660
Oh.

4472
03:28:11,160 --> 03:28:11,320
Oh.

4473
03:28:11,480 --> 03:28:11,940
Oh.

4474
03:28:12,280 --> 03:28:12,820
Oh.

4475
03:28:12,820 --> 03:28:12,980
Oh.

4476
03:28:13,100 --> 03:28:14,220
He just opened that door!

4477
03:28:17,180 --> 03:28:17,720
Oh.

4478
03:28:17,800 --> 03:28:17,980
Oh.

4479
03:28:18,260 --> 03:28:18,460
Oh.

4480
03:28:18,580 --> 03:28:18,860
Oh.

4481
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:19,480
Oh.

4482
03:28:23,280 --> 03:28:24,040
Oh.

4483
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:26,920
He thought I was inside.

4484
03:28:27,820 --> 03:28:28,740
What an idiot.

4485
03:28:30,800 --> 03:28:33,600
He thought I was inside the place.

4486
03:28:35,960 --> 03:28:37,060
Dummy-dumb.

4487
03:28:37,060 --> 03:28:38,000
No.

4488
03:28:38,660 --> 03:28:39,460
I was underneath.

4489
03:28:40,040 --> 03:28:41,560
I was under the ground.

4490
03:28:48,320 --> 03:28:50,740
How would I be shooting them from inside?

4491
03:28:51,480 --> 03:28:52,280
Use your brain.

4492
03:28:55,580 --> 03:28:56,200
Okay.

4493
03:28:56,660 --> 03:28:57,240
Hold on.

4494
03:28:57,880 --> 03:28:58,980
Let's hide somewhere.

4495
03:29:01,300 --> 03:29:02,620
It's really smart AI.

4496
03:29:02,720 --> 03:29:03,340
I'm telling you.

4497
03:29:03,440 --> 03:29:04,360
This game is...

4498
03:29:04,360 --> 03:29:05,100
Crazy.

4499
03:29:05,500 --> 03:29:07,080
This game is so crazy.

4500
03:29:08,820 --> 03:29:09,280
What?

4501
03:29:10,260 --> 03:29:12,360
If I look at the log, you guys said then call.

4502
03:29:14,780 --> 03:29:15,700
Call mayor.

4503
03:29:16,140 --> 03:29:17,440
If I look at the...

4504
03:29:17,440 --> 03:29:17,960
Wait.

4505
03:29:20,960 --> 03:29:22,080
Or is it...

4506
03:29:24,440 --> 03:29:24,900
Wait.

4507
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:26,080
No.

4508
03:29:28,580 --> 03:29:29,040
Title.

4509
03:29:30,260 --> 03:29:31,140
What do you mean title?

4510
03:29:31,300 --> 03:29:32,260
Like return to title?

4511
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:36,280
Oh, and you see a title logo.

4512
03:29:36,280 --> 03:29:36,680
Oh!

4513
03:29:36,840 --> 03:29:37,020
Oh!

4514
03:29:37,120 --> 03:29:37,680
I was like, what?

4515
03:29:37,720 --> 03:29:38,720
What are you...

4516
03:29:39,500 --> 03:29:41,180
Oh, so we should have done it for Ghost Bevel.

4517
03:29:44,790 --> 03:29:46,170
I know we gotta do this one.

4518
03:29:48,970 --> 03:29:49,510
Okay, nice.

4519
03:29:49,570 --> 03:29:50,610
We just hit a checkpoint.

4520
03:29:59,180 --> 03:30:01,900
I think as soon as I go in the middle there though, they'll...

4521
03:30:01,900 --> 03:30:02,800
It'll activate...

4522
03:30:06,480 --> 03:30:07,120
It'll activate...

4523
03:30:07,120 --> 03:30:07,860
Um...

4524
03:30:07,860 --> 03:30:08,180
Of...

4525
03:30:08,180 --> 03:30:08,780
Of...

4526
03:30:08,780 --> 03:30:09,100
Of alert.

4527
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:09,700
Oh.

4528
03:30:11,260 --> 03:30:11,900
Hello.

4529
03:30:13,800 --> 03:30:15,160
Yeah, I could go back for it.

4530
03:30:15,240 --> 03:30:15,620
You're so right.

4531
03:30:15,840 --> 03:30:17,040
Since we know where it is.

4532
03:30:18,860 --> 03:30:20,620
The old foxhound local.

4533
03:30:22,140 --> 03:30:23,360
Is there anybody else?

4534
03:30:25,180 --> 03:30:25,920
That's you.

4535
03:30:27,240 --> 03:30:28,240
Anybody else?

4536
03:30:29,500 --> 03:30:30,140
Nope.

4537
03:30:36,010 --> 03:30:36,530
Oh.

4538
03:30:37,990 --> 03:30:38,510
Oh.

4539
03:30:39,610 --> 03:30:41,930
Is that it?

4540
03:30:42,310 --> 03:30:42,670
Yeah.

4541
03:30:50,220 --> 03:30:50,740
Oh.

4542
03:30:51,380 --> 03:30:51,700
Wait.

4543
03:30:52,600 --> 03:30:53,340
There it is.

4544
03:30:53,520 --> 03:30:54,580
Oh, I was supposed to grab it.

4545
03:30:56,640 --> 03:30:57,140
Oh.

4546
03:30:58,880 --> 03:30:59,380
Oh.

4547
03:30:59,380 --> 03:30:59,820
Oh.

4548
03:30:59,940 --> 03:31:00,080
Oh.

4549
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:13,400
Oh God.

4550
03:31:13,600 --> 03:31:14,100
There's a guy right there.

4551
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:34,380
I don't even know where they're shooting.

4552
03:31:36,080 --> 03:31:36,580
Alright.

4553
03:31:37,300 --> 03:31:37,800
Guys.

4554
03:31:39,520 --> 03:31:40,620
Don't push yourself.

4555
03:31:40,940 --> 03:31:42,340
Fall back to a safe position.

4556
03:31:42,580 --> 03:31:42,880
Okay.

4557
03:31:43,140 --> 03:31:43,720
I'm safe.

4558
03:31:44,140 --> 03:31:45,960
I have to pee so bad actually.

4559
03:31:48,500 --> 03:31:50,060
I wonder if there's anyone over here.

4560
03:31:50,220 --> 03:31:51,500
CP, this is 207.

4561
03:31:51,700 --> 03:31:52,860
Lost visual contact.

4562
03:31:52,860 --> 03:31:54,580
Heading the last known position.

4563
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:55,240
Over.

4564
03:32:00,180 --> 03:32:02,520
I saw something red there, but...

4565
03:32:02,880 --> 03:32:03,500
Oh my God.

4566
03:32:03,860 --> 03:32:04,920
I didn't think.

4567
03:32:05,460 --> 03:32:06,360
Holy hell.

4568
03:32:06,640 --> 03:32:08,200
I thought it was just a color.

4569
03:32:10,940 --> 03:32:11,960
Did they hear that?

4570
03:32:13,360 --> 03:32:14,640
Oh, there's one there too.

4571
03:32:15,900 --> 03:32:16,860
There's one there too.

4572
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:17,440
I see it.

4573
03:32:20,560 --> 03:32:22,340
I don't think you can...

4574
03:32:23,820 --> 03:32:24,660
Sorry, Snake.

4575
03:32:24,860 --> 03:32:25,580
You need the heal?

4576
03:32:26,620 --> 03:32:28,400
I don't think you can grab them.

4577
03:32:32,330 --> 03:32:33,630
You don't think they heard that?

4578
03:32:36,890 --> 03:32:38,670
I wonder if there's anything down here.

4579
03:32:38,850 --> 03:32:40,170
Besides mines, obviously.

4580
03:32:45,400 --> 03:32:46,980
Anything else around here besides...

4581
03:32:47,980 --> 03:32:49,020
Besides mines?

4582
03:32:54,280 --> 03:32:54,840
Oopsie.

4583
03:32:55,960 --> 03:32:59,960
Hitting Mike Tyson's ass.

4584
03:33:01,180 --> 03:33:01,800
Thank you.

4585
03:33:02,260 --> 03:33:03,320
For the five gifted.

4586
03:33:03,520 --> 03:33:03,960
Thank you.

4587
03:33:04,840 --> 03:33:07,260
I'm gonna hide in the...

4588
03:33:07,260 --> 03:33:08,100
In here.

4589
03:33:08,460 --> 03:33:09,040
Sorry guys.

4590
03:33:09,200 --> 03:33:10,600
And I'm gonna go to the bathroom, okay?

4591
03:33:11,360 --> 03:33:13,160
Don't let Snake get caught, okay?

4592
03:33:16,500 --> 03:33:17,300
He's just...

4593
03:33:17,300 --> 03:33:18,300
He's one with the wall.

4594
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:19,000
Alright?

4595
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:19,860
I'll be right back.

4596
03:33:21,380 --> 03:33:22,360
I'll be right back.

4597
03:33:22,840 --> 03:33:23,040
I'll be right back.

4598
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:23,760
No promises.

4599
03:33:24,180 --> 03:33:25,900
We're just gonna let the alert...

4600
03:33:25,900 --> 03:33:27,260
We're just gonna let it happen.

4601
03:33:27,460 --> 03:33:27,600
You know?

4602
03:33:29,420 --> 03:33:31,060
Chilling with my godfather at work.

4603
03:33:31,180 --> 03:33:31,980
Got this in the background.

4604
03:33:31,980 --> 03:33:32,880
He loves your laughs.

4605
03:33:33,040 --> 03:33:33,360
It's great.

4606
03:33:36,220 --> 03:33:37,100
Thank you.

4607
03:33:38,460 --> 03:33:40,000
I'm also gonna grab some more water.

4608
03:33:40,140 --> 03:33:40,660
I'll be right back.

4609
03:33:42,620 --> 03:33:43,740
Go prone at least?

4610
03:33:43,980 --> 03:33:44,140
Okay.

4611
03:33:45,160 --> 03:33:45,540
Alright.

4612
03:33:45,680 --> 03:33:46,340
I'll be right back.

4613
03:33:47,920 --> 03:33:49,700
You guys be on the lookout, okay?

4614
03:33:50,480 --> 03:33:50,860
Wait.

4615
03:33:51,480 --> 03:33:52,820
Cp, this is Zulu-2.

4616
03:33:53,080 --> 03:33:54,720
We've checked the area and found nothing.

4617
03:33:55,140 --> 03:33:56,200
Calling off the search.

4618
03:33:56,500 --> 03:33:56,780
Over.

4619
03:33:57,760 --> 03:33:59,200
This is Cp, understood.

4620
03:33:59,600 --> 03:34:00,440
Stay on the alert.

4621
03:34:00,720 --> 03:34:00,920
Out.

4622
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:03,420
Cp, this is Delta-3.

4623
03:34:03,620 --> 03:34:04,960
We've finished our search of the area.

4624
03:34:08,060 --> 03:34:09,460
Zulu-7, what's wrong?

4625
03:34:09,720 --> 03:34:10,760
Come in, Zulu-7.

4626
03:35:07,100 --> 03:35:08,500
Cp, this is Delta-9.

4627
03:35:08,720 --> 03:35:09,520
All quiet here.

4628
03:35:09,860 --> 03:35:10,780
No sign of the enemy.

4629
03:35:11,300 --> 03:35:11,820
Standing down.

4630
03:35:12,120 --> 03:35:12,240
Over.

4631
03:35:13,140 --> 03:35:14,800
This is Cp, understood.

4632
03:35:14,800 --> 03:35:17,000
All fire teams, return to your posts.

4633
03:35:17,380 --> 03:35:17,540
Out.

4634
03:36:21,460 --> 03:36:22,120
I'm back.

4635
03:36:22,920 --> 03:36:24,280
Is everything good?

4636
03:36:25,120 --> 03:36:26,260
Are we okay?

4637
03:36:27,620 --> 03:36:28,940
Is everything alright?

4638
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:33,520
I thought I saw something shiny here, but it's a plant.

4639
03:36:37,120 --> 03:36:38,080
Welcome back.

4640
03:36:38,380 --> 03:36:39,040
Thank you.

4641
03:36:39,400 --> 03:36:41,440
I feel like there should be something down here, no?

4642
03:36:42,360 --> 03:36:43,720
I guess maybe not.

4643
03:36:44,680 --> 03:36:45,300
It's all...

4644
03:36:46,060 --> 03:36:47,260
It's all...

4645
03:36:48,040 --> 03:36:48,800
What's it called?

4646
03:36:48,940 --> 03:36:49,360
All clear?

4647
03:36:53,540 --> 03:36:55,360
They got close, but we distracted them.

4648
03:36:55,460 --> 03:36:56,400
Good job, team.

4649
03:36:57,560 --> 03:36:59,940
Zulu-7 disappeared from the face of the game.

4650
03:37:00,320 --> 03:37:01,480
Wait, what do you mean by that?

4651
03:37:02,560 --> 03:37:03,260
Zulu-7.

4652
03:37:06,740 --> 03:37:07,680
Alert is all clear.

4653
03:37:07,820 --> 03:37:08,140
Let's go!

4654
03:37:08,480 --> 03:37:09,420
Okay, let's go get that.

4655
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:14,160
Let's not...

4656
03:37:14,160 --> 03:37:14,220
Let's...

4657
03:37:14,220 --> 03:37:14,760
Let's not...

4658
03:37:14,760 --> 03:37:16,820
Get be exploded...

4659
03:37:18,100 --> 03:37:18,860
By...

4660
03:37:19,280 --> 03:37:19,660
Um...

4661
03:37:19,660 --> 03:37:20,260
Bombs.

4662
03:37:22,300 --> 03:37:24,040
This is a minefield.

4663
03:37:25,180 --> 03:37:26,720
One of your fans.

4664
03:37:27,020 --> 03:37:27,380
Something...

4665
03:37:27,380 --> 03:37:27,460
Oh!

4666
03:37:27,740 --> 03:37:27,820
Oh!

4667
03:37:28,220 --> 03:37:28,580
See?

4668
03:37:30,420 --> 03:37:33,560
Hey, aren't you supposed to be able to pick these up, though?

4669
03:37:33,720 --> 03:37:33,800
No?

4670
03:37:35,520 --> 03:37:36,300
Messed up.

4671
03:37:36,920 --> 03:37:45,080
I saw the red light, and I seriously thought it was just like a... Like, a lighting thing.

4672
03:37:46,760 --> 03:37:47,880
I really thought.

4673
03:37:48,620 --> 03:37:53,580
And I think while I was on the toilet, I think I remember where the moai is.

4674
03:37:53,580 --> 03:37:54,940
What?

4675
03:37:54,940 --> 03:37:55,140
Oh, wait.

4676
03:38:00,200 --> 03:38:01,380
What's that?

4677
03:38:04,340 --> 03:38:05,680
Metal Gear.

4678
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:06,140
Wait.

4679
03:38:12,180 --> 03:38:19,950
Ghost Babel Erasure?

4680
03:38:21,550 --> 03:38:23,470
Ghost Babel Erasure?

4681
03:38:26,330 --> 03:38:27,270
No way.

4682
03:38:28,670 --> 03:38:29,730
It's messed up.

4683
03:38:29,910 --> 03:38:31,490
That's messed up, Kaz.

4684
03:38:32,390 --> 03:38:34,430
Okay, let's look at the photos again.

4685
03:38:34,490 --> 03:38:36,270
If you want to finish the mission, head for the goal.

4686
03:38:36,490 --> 03:38:37,690
I've marked it on your map.

4687
03:38:37,890 --> 03:38:40,430
If you want to look for those other scenes, go ahead.

4688
03:38:41,130 --> 03:38:41,610
Oh.

4689
03:38:43,850 --> 03:38:44,330
What?

4690
03:38:45,170 --> 03:38:46,350
What do you mean by that?

4691
03:38:46,530 --> 03:38:47,470
Where is this, anyway?

4692
03:38:49,290 --> 03:38:51,550
Oh, this is the... Intelligence?

4693
03:38:51,950 --> 03:38:52,670
The tower?

4694
03:38:53,110 --> 03:38:54,350
I think... What?

4695
03:38:58,030 --> 03:38:58,550
Darkness.

4696
03:38:59,470 --> 03:39:01,250
Like some kind of blackout.

4697
03:39:02,150 --> 03:39:02,610
Snake.

4698
03:39:02,830 --> 03:39:04,470
It should be on the back of the disc case.

4699
03:39:04,850 --> 03:39:05,950
Or what about the manual?

4700
03:39:06,250 --> 03:39:07,490
There's gotta be a clue somewhere.

4701
03:39:14,290 --> 03:39:14,930
Huh?

4702
03:39:14,930 --> 03:39:16,670
How do I create that one?

4703
03:39:18,250 --> 03:39:20,450
Do I, like, blow up the tank?

4704
03:39:21,330 --> 03:39:22,710
A surveillance camera.

4705
03:39:22,890 --> 03:39:24,330
Okay, that one's... With a green light.

4706
03:39:24,990 --> 03:39:26,030
Green light.

4707
03:39:26,970 --> 03:39:28,210
This area...

4708
03:39:31,470 --> 03:39:34,010
This area looks by the admin building.

4709
03:39:34,010 --> 03:39:36,690
A chumper and two sentries.

4710
03:39:37,370 --> 03:39:37,890
What?

4711
03:39:38,030 --> 03:39:41,230
I... Oh, I wasn't on the... Oh, there's gotta be two guys!

4712
03:39:41,670 --> 03:39:42,210
Two men.

4713
03:39:42,890 --> 03:39:44,730
Uh-oh, I gotta not kill all the men, huh?

4714
03:39:45,670 --> 03:39:47,470
A well-placed grenade.

4715
03:39:48,050 --> 03:39:48,570
Yeah!

4716
03:39:49,750 --> 03:39:50,310
Okay.

4717
03:39:51,770 --> 03:39:52,330
Alright.

4718
03:39:53,970 --> 03:39:55,190
Back at it.

4719
03:39:56,750 --> 03:40:02,250
I might need a hint for the blackout one, since I'm, like, not sure where to look.

4720
03:40:03,010 --> 03:40:03,730
Almost there.

4721
03:40:04,030 --> 03:40:04,750
Almost where?

4722
03:40:05,850 --> 03:40:06,710
To the gold?

4723
03:40:06,850 --> 03:40:07,130
No, no.

4724
03:40:07,690 --> 03:40:10,650
We... We have more things to look at, cause...

4725
03:40:12,390 --> 03:40:13,810
Two guys, one hindu.

4726
03:40:17,430 --> 03:40:17,870
Sickos.

4727
03:40:27,640 --> 03:40:29,140
Wonder if there's a logo in here.

4728
03:40:30,920 --> 03:40:32,240
Oh, there is a magazine.

4729
03:40:32,620 --> 03:40:32,860
Yep.

4730
03:40:48,970 --> 03:40:51,390
Security camera with a green light.

4731
03:41:03,900 --> 03:41:06,060
Oh wait, there's no security camera here now.

4732
03:41:06,880 --> 03:41:07,540
Fancy.

4733
03:41:08,140 --> 03:41:09,020
Okay, hold on.

4734
03:41:09,760 --> 03:41:12,700
I think the mobile is in here.

4735
03:41:16,390 --> 03:41:16,910
Where?

4736
03:41:17,030 --> 03:41:17,430
Where is it...

4737
03:41:17,430 --> 03:41:17,450
Snake.

4738
03:41:17,810 --> 03:41:19,330
This is Kazuhiro Mile.

4739
03:41:19,710 --> 03:41:20,970
It's been a long time.

4740
03:41:21,550 --> 03:41:22,070
Master.

4741
03:41:22,810 --> 03:41:24,090
What are you doing here?

4742
03:41:27,470 --> 03:41:29,350
Oh my god, that's too good!

4743
03:41:30,350 --> 03:41:31,690
Okay, it's not this one.

4744
03:41:33,610 --> 03:41:34,490
Is that it?

4745
03:41:34,890 --> 03:41:35,710
Is that what?

4746
03:41:38,190 --> 03:41:39,330
What are you talking about?

4747
03:41:39,550 --> 03:41:40,130
Almost there.

4748
03:41:42,930 --> 03:41:44,290
Stop talking, Kaz.

4749
03:41:44,970 --> 03:41:45,750
Is that it?

4750
03:41:46,350 --> 03:41:47,330
Is what it?

4751
03:41:47,390 --> 03:41:48,270
What are you talking about?

4752
03:41:52,230 --> 03:41:53,050
Almost there.

4753
03:41:53,230 --> 03:41:54,710
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see.

4754
03:41:54,850 --> 03:41:55,290
This one.

4755
03:41:59,760 --> 03:42:01,520
All the cameras are in different places.

4756
03:42:01,860 --> 03:42:02,200
Is that it?

4757
03:42:04,140 --> 03:42:04,840
There it is.

4758
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:05,260
Yay!

4759
03:42:05,960 --> 03:42:06,920
Yeah, the surveillance camera.

4760
03:42:09,160 --> 03:42:10,520
That's really weird hearing.

4761
03:42:14,240 --> 03:42:15,920
Keeper Sutherland say that.

4762
03:42:18,280 --> 03:42:20,220
Great, you recreated a scene.

4763
03:42:20,640 --> 03:42:21,460
I recreated...

4764
03:42:21,980 --> 03:42:22,540
I'm making it.

4765
03:42:22,600 --> 03:42:23,440
I'm causing a scene.

4766
03:42:23,880 --> 03:42:24,540
Right now.

4767
03:42:25,140 --> 03:42:26,280
I'm causing a scene.

4768
03:42:27,020 --> 03:42:28,400
Wait, I need another guy.

4769
03:42:29,360 --> 03:42:30,580
At the...

4770
03:42:33,460 --> 03:42:34,380
What's that?

4771
03:42:36,360 --> 03:42:37,840
What is that box?

4772
03:42:39,220 --> 03:42:41,020
I need another guy at the...

4773
03:42:41,020 --> 03:42:41,920
Helicopter.

4774
03:42:44,480 --> 03:42:46,120
Remember that time there was a camera?

4775
03:42:46,580 --> 03:42:47,100
So...

4776
03:42:47,100 --> 03:42:47,820
Memorable.

4777
03:42:47,980 --> 03:42:48,460
It is though.

4778
03:42:48,780 --> 03:42:49,880
It actually is.

4779
03:42:52,480 --> 03:42:53,720
It is memorable.

4780
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:58,440
What is he talking about?

4781
03:42:59,020 --> 03:42:59,540
He's...

4782
03:42:59,540 --> 03:43:00,560
He's driving me crazy.

4783
03:43:01,020 --> 03:43:02,520
I think he wants me up there.

4784
03:43:02,620 --> 03:43:03,400
Also the clouds.

4785
03:43:03,660 --> 03:43:04,380
Holy moly.

4786
03:43:06,020 --> 03:43:07,120
Almost there.

4787
03:43:07,460 --> 03:43:08,420
I killed him?

4788
03:43:08,640 --> 03:43:09,380
No, I didn't.

4789
03:43:10,460 --> 03:43:11,540
I might have.

4790
03:43:16,960 --> 03:43:18,640
Guys, shut up!

4791
03:43:19,200 --> 03:43:20,180
Holy cow.

4792
03:43:20,600 --> 03:43:21,660
Please shut up.

4793
03:43:24,800 --> 03:43:25,440
Wait.

4794
03:43:29,320 --> 03:43:29,960
Uh...

4795
03:43:35,070 --> 03:43:36,950
Why is there gotta be...

4796
03:43:36,950 --> 03:43:37,330
It's not right.

4797
03:43:37,430 --> 03:43:38,230
There's something missing.

4798
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:39,490
Ugh!

4799
03:43:40,270 --> 03:43:41,230
It's not right!

4800
03:43:41,350 --> 03:43:42,570
There's something missing!

4801
03:43:43,010 --> 03:43:43,390
Okay.

4802
03:43:44,430 --> 03:43:46,410
I guess I can't do that one.

4803
03:43:46,990 --> 03:43:47,690
My bad.

4804
03:43:48,470 --> 03:43:49,390
My bad!

4805
03:43:51,250 --> 03:43:52,310
Is that it?

4806
03:43:57,630 --> 03:43:58,510
But I can...

4807
03:43:58,890 --> 03:44:00,810
Complete the mission without...

4808
03:44:00,810 --> 03:44:01,650
Getting all of them.

4809
03:44:01,710 --> 03:44:02,090
I suppose.

4810
03:44:02,630 --> 03:44:02,910
So...

4811
03:44:02,910 --> 03:44:03,430
If it's...

4812
03:44:05,910 --> 03:44:07,410
If it's like kind of...

4813
03:44:07,410 --> 03:44:08,330
Messed up.

4814
03:44:08,510 --> 03:44:08,990
Then you know.

4815
03:44:09,730 --> 03:44:11,330
It is what it is!

4816
03:44:11,410 --> 03:44:12,210
Let's go in this one.

4817
03:44:15,670 --> 03:44:17,130
Maybe the moai...

4818
03:44:17,130 --> 03:44:17,450
Oh...

4819
03:44:17,450 --> 03:44:18,310
Snake...

4820
03:44:18,310 --> 03:44:19,570
Right here.

4821
03:44:19,770 --> 03:44:20,130
There you go.

4822
03:44:20,670 --> 03:44:22,390
I think the moai might be in here.

4823
03:44:25,950 --> 03:44:26,630
Turn...

4824
03:44:27,670 --> 03:44:28,770
It's a wall.

4825
03:44:28,990 --> 03:44:30,190
Turn the other way.

4826
03:44:30,450 --> 03:44:31,170
It's a wall.

4827
03:44:34,030 --> 03:44:34,710
Uh...

4828
03:44:34,710 --> 03:44:36,850
Nope, that's...

4829
03:44:39,230 --> 03:44:39,570
Right...

4830
03:44:39,910 --> 03:44:40,570
Here!

4831
03:44:41,270 --> 03:44:42,190
No, uh...

4832
03:44:42,190 --> 03:44:42,890
Here...

4833
03:44:42,890 --> 03:44:44,050
Oh, that's a wall.

4834
03:44:44,710 --> 03:44:45,210
Here!

4835
03:44:47,130 --> 03:44:47,810
Right...

4836
03:44:47,810 --> 03:44:49,710
It encourages multiple plays, so you're good.

4837
03:44:49,930 --> 03:44:50,150
Yeah.

4838
03:44:52,910 --> 03:44:53,470
Right...

4839
03:44:54,450 --> 03:44:55,010
Here!

4840
03:44:55,810 --> 03:44:56,370
What?

4841
03:44:56,530 --> 03:44:57,150
Where is he?

4842
03:44:58,350 --> 03:44:59,130
Oh, wait.

4843
03:44:59,370 --> 03:44:59,730
Or...

4844
03:45:00,570 --> 03:45:01,850
Or is it downstairs?

4845
03:45:02,610 --> 03:45:03,070
Where?

4846
03:45:03,330 --> 03:45:03,870
Pause is.

4847
03:45:04,190 --> 03:45:04,370
Pause.

4848
03:45:05,510 --> 03:45:06,410
Almost there.

4849
03:45:09,150 --> 03:45:09,710
What...

4850
03:45:09,710 --> 03:45:10,410
What is this music?

4851
03:45:15,580 --> 03:45:16,740
What am I close to?

4852
03:45:17,040 --> 03:45:17,400
Um...

4853
03:45:17,400 --> 03:45:17,700
Hold on.

4854
03:45:18,760 --> 03:45:19,680
Music change.

4855
03:45:19,900 --> 03:45:20,080
Yeah.

4856
03:45:20,580 --> 03:45:21,600
Head for the gold.

4857
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:22,980
A chopper and two sentries.

4858
03:45:23,000 --> 03:45:23,920
Okay, so we can't do that one.

4859
03:45:24,280 --> 03:45:24,400
Huh.

4860
03:45:25,120 --> 03:45:25,820
Where could it be?

4861
03:45:27,840 --> 03:45:29,840
I'm looking at it, but I don't...

4862
03:45:31,700 --> 03:45:32,500
The power!

4863
03:45:32,760 --> 03:45:33,200
That's right!

4864
03:45:33,420 --> 03:45:33,940
A soldier...

4865
03:45:33,940 --> 03:45:34,960
And a tank?

4866
03:45:35,880 --> 03:45:36,280
Uh...

4867
03:45:36,280 --> 03:45:37,800
We can turn off the power around here.

4868
03:45:37,900 --> 03:45:38,020
Yeah.

4869
03:45:39,580 --> 03:45:40,420
Where at, though?

4870
03:45:40,420 --> 03:45:40,980
I don't remember.

4871
03:45:42,400 --> 03:45:43,160
Is that it?

4872
03:45:43,160 --> 03:45:44,460
Oh my god.

4873
03:45:44,580 --> 03:45:44,740
Oh my god.

4874
03:45:44,740 --> 03:45:46,160
Over here, over here.

4875
03:45:50,450 --> 03:45:51,010
Beep!

4876
03:46:09,800 --> 03:46:11,600
That's another scene recreated.

4877
03:46:12,000 --> 03:46:12,640
Nice work.

4878
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:13,420
Thank you.

4879
03:46:13,960 --> 03:46:16,040
We're as close as go check on the power system.

4880
03:46:16,340 --> 03:46:16,640
Over.

4881
03:46:19,750 --> 03:46:21,370
CP, this is Delta IV.

4882
03:46:21,590 --> 03:46:22,770
We'll investigate ASAP.

4883
03:46:23,130 --> 03:46:23,390
Ouch.

4884
03:46:27,410 --> 03:46:28,970
The music is too good.

4885
03:46:31,630 --> 03:46:34,390
I think this is where they want me to go to end...

4886
03:46:34,390 --> 03:46:35,030
Oh my god.

4887
03:46:35,910 --> 03:46:37,910
I didn't know there was actual guys up here.

4888
03:46:38,730 --> 03:46:40,170
I just thought...

4889
03:46:40,170 --> 03:46:42,030
I thought they were automated.

4890
03:46:44,870 --> 03:46:45,350
Oh...

4891
03:46:52,650 --> 03:46:54,950
The hint on the back of the box was the Hideo...

4892
03:46:54,950 --> 03:46:55,170
Oh!

4893
03:46:55,410 --> 03:46:56,250
Okay, okay, okay.

4894
03:46:56,950 --> 03:46:57,430
Um...

4895
03:46:57,430 --> 03:46:58,090
Hold on now.

4896
03:46:58,350 --> 03:47:00,270
I don't think they're gonna look over here, so...

4897
03:47:00,270 --> 03:47:00,830
If they do...

4898
03:47:00,830 --> 03:47:01,430
A soldier...

4899
03:47:01,430 --> 03:47:02,350
And a...

4900
03:47:02,350 --> 03:47:03,090
A car.

4901
03:47:03,390 --> 03:47:04,370
The more eyes!

4902
03:47:04,610 --> 03:47:05,830
The only thing I'm like...

4903
03:47:05,830 --> 03:47:06,090
Where?

4904
03:47:07,510 --> 03:47:08,470
A chomper...

4905
03:47:08,470 --> 03:47:09,210
And two...

4906
03:47:10,290 --> 03:47:11,310
Where could it be?

4907
03:47:12,850 --> 03:47:15,770
Oh, shoot.

4908
03:47:15,830 --> 03:47:16,290
Who sees me?

4909
03:47:17,430 --> 03:47:18,190
This guy?

4910
03:47:18,350 --> 03:47:18,630
Seriously?

4911
03:47:18,990 --> 03:47:19,630
You don't.

4912
03:47:19,770 --> 03:47:20,590
Don't lie.

4913
03:47:24,980 --> 03:47:25,780
Don't lie.

4914
03:47:26,360 --> 03:47:26,880
You...

4915
03:47:26,880 --> 03:47:27,500
Don't lie.

4916
03:47:28,340 --> 03:47:29,080
Don't lie.

4917
03:47:29,240 --> 03:47:29,520
Oh!

4918
03:47:29,680 --> 03:47:30,340
Metal Gear Rising!

4919
03:47:31,640 --> 03:47:33,980
If you wanna finish the mission, head for the goal.

4920
03:47:34,180 --> 03:47:36,700
If you wanna look for those other scenes, go ahead.

4921
03:47:39,360 --> 03:47:39,880
Stop!

4922
03:47:40,100 --> 03:47:40,820
You don't see me!

4923
03:47:43,700 --> 03:47:44,740
Metal Gear...

4924
03:47:44,740 --> 03:47:46,100
Something something...

4925
03:47:48,460 --> 03:47:49,180
Oh, shoot.

4926
03:47:50,940 --> 03:47:51,720
I should leave.

4927
03:47:54,540 --> 03:47:55,500
I'm getting out of here.

4928
03:48:00,920 --> 03:48:02,360
Yeah, you don't see me, dummy.

4929
03:48:03,200 --> 03:48:04,940
You don't see me, dummy, idiot.

4930
03:48:05,400 --> 03:48:05,640
Stupid.

4931
03:48:06,700 --> 03:48:07,500
No perceive.

4932
03:48:07,880 --> 03:48:08,000
Yeah.

4933
03:48:10,180 --> 03:48:11,760
Oh, it's completely dark in here.

4934
03:48:13,040 --> 03:48:14,360
Maybe the Moai...

4935
03:48:14,360 --> 03:48:16,100
Oh, it's somewhere around here.

4936
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:21,100
I like how the guy investigated the power and then...

4937
03:48:21,100 --> 03:48:22,980
Just decided not to turn it back on.

4938
03:48:25,520 --> 03:48:27,340
Yeah, I was thinking it looks like these.

4939
03:48:27,680 --> 03:48:28,220
Oh, but no.

4940
03:48:37,860 --> 03:48:38,340
Moai...

4941
03:48:49,050 --> 03:48:49,530
Moai...

4942
03:48:50,510 --> 03:48:50,990
Moai...

4943
03:48:50,990 --> 03:48:51,730
Getting colder?

4944
03:48:52,210 --> 03:48:53,390
Who the hell are you?

4945
03:48:58,840 --> 03:49:00,000
Can I actually save you?

4946
03:49:15,240 --> 03:49:16,400
I think he'll die too.

4947
03:49:17,340 --> 03:49:17,880
Oh.

4948
03:49:22,320 --> 03:49:23,060
Oh no!

4949
03:49:23,440 --> 03:49:24,020
I beat you!

4950
03:49:38,220 --> 03:49:39,020
Bye-bye.

4951
03:49:42,020 --> 03:49:42,560
Oh.

4952
03:49:42,560 --> 03:49:43,000
Dead.

4953
03:49:43,740 --> 03:49:44,100
Again?

4954
03:49:45,280 --> 03:49:45,740
Woah!

4955
03:49:46,120 --> 03:49:46,800
What is that?

4956
03:49:52,220 --> 03:49:52,680
Woah!

4957
03:49:54,060 --> 03:49:54,160
Woah!

4958
03:49:54,460 --> 03:49:55,340
Woah!

4959
03:49:55,960 --> 03:49:56,460
Woah!

4960
03:49:57,420 --> 03:49:58,040
What's happening?

4961
03:50:00,340 --> 03:50:00,720
Ah!

4962
03:50:05,940 --> 03:50:06,860
What?

4963
03:50:06,860 --> 03:50:07,240
What?

4964
03:50:08,900 --> 03:50:10,940
I've never seen that before.

4965
03:50:11,800 --> 03:50:12,400
What?

4966
03:50:13,220 --> 03:50:13,820
Fox?

4967
03:50:20,200 --> 03:50:21,620
Thanks, Fox Engine.

4968
03:50:21,840 --> 03:50:22,500
Who saw me?

4969
03:50:23,100 --> 03:50:23,300
Oh.

4970
03:50:23,840 --> 03:50:25,440
There's a guy, like, right there, actually.

4971
03:50:26,500 --> 03:50:27,620
Maybe I can get him.

4972
03:50:36,370 --> 03:50:37,150
Come here.

4973
03:50:39,010 --> 03:50:39,810
Come here.

4974
03:50:41,570 --> 03:50:42,610
Oh, nope.

4975
03:50:42,850 --> 03:50:43,870
He's just standing there.

4976
03:50:43,890 --> 03:50:44,590
Bless you.

4977
03:50:44,730 --> 03:50:45,130
Oh, no.

4978
03:50:45,230 --> 03:50:45,570
He's coughing.

4979
03:50:45,890 --> 03:50:47,730
Oh, I don't... I do not want what you have.

4980
03:50:48,830 --> 03:50:51,670
I do not want... I missed it.

4981
03:50:52,570 --> 03:50:53,570
What did I miss?

4982
03:50:55,350 --> 03:50:56,210
The... Mulai?

4983
03:51:01,040 --> 03:51:01,600
Mulai?

4984
03:51:05,890 --> 03:51:06,450
Woo!

4985
03:51:17,430 --> 03:51:17,990
Woo!

4986
03:51:19,450 --> 03:51:20,430
Way of the room.

4987
03:51:45,580 --> 03:51:46,960
Is he so tiny?

4988
03:51:49,560 --> 03:51:51,760
I... I'm actually blind, you guys.

4989
03:51:51,880 --> 03:51:52,920
Take a left at the door.

4990
03:51:56,020 --> 03:51:57,040
Like, here.

4991
03:52:00,540 --> 03:52:01,180
Oh!

4992
03:52:09,210 --> 03:52:10,370
I ran right fast over!

4993
03:52:17,340 --> 03:52:19,780
Yes, you recreated another scene.

4994
03:52:19,960 --> 03:52:20,600
Yes!

4995
03:52:22,440 --> 03:52:24,820
Yes, you recreated another scene!

4996
03:52:38,310 --> 03:52:39,130
What the?

4997
03:52:39,330 --> 03:52:40,850
No freaking way.

4998
03:52:41,510 --> 03:52:42,550
Oh, my God.

4999
03:52:43,250 --> 03:52:43,770
No!

5000
03:52:45,550 --> 03:52:46,150
No!

5001
03:52:47,650 --> 03:52:48,490
Oh, my God.

5002
03:52:48,690 --> 03:52:48,790
Wait.

5003
03:52:48,910 --> 03:52:49,030
Ah!

5004
03:52:49,250 --> 03:52:49,390
Wait.

5005
03:52:49,490 --> 03:52:49,850
No, no, no.

5006
03:52:50,190 --> 03:52:50,410
No.

5007
03:52:53,130 --> 03:52:53,730
Oh.

5008
03:52:54,770 --> 03:52:55,070
Oh.

5009
03:52:56,150 --> 03:52:56,330
Oh.

5010
03:52:56,330 --> 03:52:56,630
Oh.

5011
03:52:58,970 --> 03:52:58,970
Uh.

5012
03:52:59,950 --> 03:53:00,550
Sorry.

5013
03:53:01,490 --> 03:53:02,150
You too.

5014
03:53:02,750 --> 03:53:03,310
Asshole.

5015
03:53:03,770 --> 03:53:04,170
God.

5016
03:53:04,790 --> 03:53:05,310
Uh.

5017
03:53:07,930 --> 03:53:08,450
Um.

5018
03:53:12,420 --> 03:53:13,100
Hold on.

5019
03:53:13,640 --> 03:53:15,160
Where is the goal now?

5020
03:53:16,880 --> 03:53:18,320
It was where I thought it was.

5021
03:53:18,560 --> 03:53:18,960
Right?

5022
03:53:19,160 --> 03:53:20,860
Up... up... up... Actually, I don't know.

5023
03:53:34,530 --> 03:53:35,770
They didn't even try.

5024
03:53:49,770 --> 03:53:51,450
I don't know if I'll get that one.

5025
03:53:51,450 --> 03:53:52,090
A car.

5026
03:53:54,630 --> 03:53:57,510
We had a big car, but we didn't have a small car.

5027
03:53:58,090 --> 03:53:59,050
What is the car?

5028
03:53:59,250 --> 03:54:00,930
Oh, the car is probably in reference to...

5029
03:54:03,070 --> 03:54:03,470
Um...

5030
03:54:03,470 --> 03:54:05,010
Like the end scene.

5031
03:54:05,550 --> 03:54:07,130
With, when you're going again...

5032
03:54:07,130 --> 03:54:09,150
When you're leaving Shadow Moses.

5033
03:54:09,590 --> 03:54:10,330
Yeah, the ending.

5034
03:54:11,150 --> 03:54:12,830
The car is beside the helicopter.

5035
03:54:13,170 --> 03:54:13,410
Oh!

5036
03:54:13,630 --> 03:54:13,950
Okay, okay.

5037
03:54:14,290 --> 03:54:15,150
The escape scene.

5038
03:54:15,310 --> 03:54:15,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5039
03:54:16,590 --> 03:54:18,230
So, we can probably try and do that.

5040
03:54:25,220 --> 03:54:27,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

5041
03:54:29,740 --> 03:54:30,540
Oh, clear.

5042
03:54:30,820 --> 03:54:30,960
Yup.

5043
03:54:32,200 --> 03:54:33,280
Yup, clear, yup.

5044
03:54:33,500 --> 03:54:33,840
So clear.

5045
03:54:33,840 --> 03:54:35,780
Oh my god, wait, don't see me.

5046
03:54:42,450 --> 03:54:43,630
There's four of them!

5047
03:54:44,090 --> 03:54:44,710
What if I just...

5048
03:54:56,710 --> 03:54:57,590
Ah, so close.

5049
03:55:08,850 --> 03:55:09,630
Smoke him out!

5050
03:55:12,470 --> 03:55:13,770
Yeah, that would have been good.

5051
03:55:24,790 --> 03:55:26,630
Oh, starting to get daylight.

5052
03:55:29,810 --> 03:55:31,390
Zulu 7 is alive!

5053
03:55:34,550 --> 03:55:36,190
That's our goal, Zulu 7.

5054
03:55:36,870 --> 03:55:38,070
I hate that guy.

5055
03:55:39,530 --> 03:55:41,110
Oh, I can try again.

5056
03:55:46,660 --> 03:55:47,860
I'll make it this time.

5057
03:55:53,870 --> 03:55:54,490
What

5058
03:56:06,320 --> 03:56:07,120
else we got in here?

5059
03:56:07,360 --> 03:56:08,160
Oh, is that a sniper?

5060
03:56:09,260 --> 03:56:10,340
Oh, shoddy!

5061
03:56:13,140 --> 03:56:13,760
Oh!

5062
03:56:17,000 --> 03:56:18,200
I'll take that.

5063
03:56:20,740 --> 03:56:21,980
Definitely ruining...

5064
03:56:21,980 --> 03:56:22,180
Oh.

5065
03:56:23,580 --> 03:56:25,080
CP, this is Delta 6.

5066
03:56:25,280 --> 03:56:26,380
We've arrived on the scene.

5067
03:56:26,720 --> 03:56:27,580
Checking the area.

5068
03:56:27,960 --> 03:56:28,140
Over.

5069
03:56:28,440 --> 03:56:29,220
Yeah, check the area.

5070
03:56:29,440 --> 03:56:30,320
CP, understood.

5071
03:56:30,700 --> 03:56:31,600
Keep your eyes open.

5072
03:56:31,920 --> 03:56:32,100
Out.

5073
03:56:32,780 --> 03:56:34,880
Is that guy also gonna report something over there?

5074
03:56:35,060 --> 03:56:35,960
What are you reporting?

5075
03:56:41,260 --> 03:56:42,180
There's the car.

5076
03:56:44,760 --> 03:56:47,360
We'll get this guy once he, uh...

5077
03:56:47,360 --> 03:56:48,000
Comes around.

5078
03:56:50,740 --> 03:56:51,960
Yeah, the spotlight.

5079
03:57:02,010 --> 03:57:02,910
Who said that?

5080
03:57:03,010 --> 03:57:03,170
Oh!

5081
03:57:04,750 --> 03:57:05,330
Uh...

5082
03:57:05,990 --> 03:57:06,550
That's awkward.

5083
03:57:13,520 --> 03:57:14,300
Oh no!

5084
03:57:21,950 --> 03:57:22,570
Spray and pray.

5085
03:57:22,950 --> 03:57:23,690
Oh, did I go too far?

5086
03:57:24,450 --> 03:57:25,510
Oh damn, I went too far.

5087
03:57:28,950 --> 03:57:30,230
I don't think he knows what to do.

5088
03:57:30,550 --> 03:57:31,750
He looks really confused.

5089
03:57:38,730 --> 03:57:39,830
Can I get him through the bag?

5090
03:57:41,770 --> 03:57:42,170
Oh!

5091
03:57:42,590 --> 03:57:44,590
I think we killed everybody, you guys!

5092
03:57:45,530 --> 03:57:46,090
Woohoo!

5093
03:57:52,120 --> 03:57:53,480
It's my car now!

5094
03:57:58,580 --> 03:58:00,340
What am I supposed to...

5095
03:58:08,500 --> 03:58:09,620
Almost there?

5096
03:58:09,800 --> 03:58:10,400
Oh, ah!

5097
03:58:10,800 --> 03:58:11,160
Oh!

5098
03:58:11,240 --> 03:58:12,320
Because it looks like the tunnel!

5099
03:58:12,580 --> 03:58:13,860
Oh my god, that's so funny.

5100
03:58:18,940 --> 03:58:19,500
Okay.

5101
03:58:23,760 --> 03:58:24,600
We created liquid.

5102
03:58:24,960 --> 03:58:25,680
I don't like that.

5103
03:58:27,080 --> 03:58:28,920
I don't like...

5104
03:58:29,580 --> 03:58:30,080
That...

5105
03:58:30,080 --> 03:58:30,680
Name.

5106
03:58:33,860 --> 03:58:34,360
Okay!

5107
03:58:35,340 --> 03:58:36,580
That guy's bleeding out.

5108
03:58:38,220 --> 03:58:40,340
I guess we did most of them, which is great.

5109
03:58:44,240 --> 03:58:45,340
I guess they're all dead.

5110
03:58:46,100 --> 03:58:47,180
My base now.

5111
03:58:50,320 --> 03:58:51,140
Here, hold on.

5112
03:58:51,260 --> 03:58:51,860
I'll fill it in.

5113
03:58:52,820 --> 03:58:54,240
Take another look at the VI.

5114
03:58:54,720 --> 03:58:55,700
The V... Oh.

5115
03:58:56,520 --> 03:58:57,180
Like the...

5116
03:58:57,720 --> 03:58:57,960
Droid?

5117
03:58:59,240 --> 03:59:00,200
And then...

5118
03:59:00,200 --> 03:59:00,620
The tank!

5119
03:59:01,020 --> 03:59:02,520
I didn't even see a tank.

5120
03:59:03,920 --> 03:59:04,400
Hmm...

5121
03:59:04,400 --> 03:59:05,400
You can still do the tank?

5122
03:59:05,500 --> 03:59:06,140
Where is it?

5123
03:59:09,720 --> 03:59:12,100
You can't do the helicopter because you murdered everyone.

5124
03:59:12,260 --> 03:59:15,460
It's fine because I couldn't do it because I had already murdered the guy anyway.

5125
03:59:17,800 --> 03:59:19,600
Tent area southwest.

5126
03:59:19,600 --> 03:59:19,720
Tent area southwest.

5127
03:59:25,830 --> 03:59:26,290
Okay.

5128
03:59:26,790 --> 03:59:27,490
So...

5129
03:59:27,490 --> 03:59:28,530
Where I...

5130
03:59:28,530 --> 03:59:29,170
This way.

5131
03:59:30,010 --> 03:59:31,170
So like this area.

5132
03:59:34,710 --> 03:59:35,170
Yeah.

5133
03:59:35,430 --> 03:59:35,530
Okay.

5134
03:59:39,590 --> 03:59:40,890
Let's go baby!

5135
03:59:42,270 --> 03:59:43,690
Let's go baby!

5136
03:59:44,570 --> 03:59:46,130
What if there's somebody left though?

5137
03:59:46,210 --> 03:59:46,870
I'll be scared.

5138
03:59:52,810 --> 03:59:54,010
Oh, that scared me.

5139
03:59:54,070 --> 03:59:54,890
I thought it was a dog.

5140
03:59:55,350 --> 03:59:56,550
It is a dog!

5141
03:59:56,970 --> 03:59:57,870
I mean...

5142
03:59:57,870 --> 03:59:58,750
It's a fox.

5143
03:59:58,910 --> 03:59:59,430
Hound!

5144
04:00:00,470 --> 04:00:01,410
Tent area.

5145
04:00:01,770 --> 04:00:02,350
Ah, there it is.

5146
04:00:02,650 --> 04:00:03,230
Thank you.

5147
04:00:03,230 --> 04:00:03,310
Yeah.

5148
04:00:10,480 --> 04:00:11,540
Is that it?

5149
04:00:11,660 --> 04:00:12,280
Almost there.

5150
04:00:13,860 --> 04:00:15,060
What do I do here?

5151
04:00:16,340 --> 04:00:17,020
Just...

5152
04:00:17,020 --> 04:00:17,980
Explode it?

5153
04:00:18,740 --> 04:00:19,540
Is that it?

5154
04:00:27,580 --> 04:00:28,640
Almost there.

5155
04:00:33,840 --> 04:00:35,320
Could you bring a body there?

5156
04:00:37,480 --> 04:00:38,160
Oh...

5157
04:00:39,340 --> 04:00:40,380
Is that it?

5158
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:42,700
Ah...

5159
04:00:43,420 --> 04:00:44,780
Throw it down the hatch.

5160
04:00:45,000 --> 04:00:45,200
Ah!

5161
04:00:45,820 --> 04:00:46,820
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

5162
04:00:47,000 --> 04:00:47,500
Almost there.

5163
04:00:47,760 --> 04:00:48,560
Let's try it.

5164
04:00:56,500 --> 04:00:57,580
There he is!

5165
04:01:04,750 --> 04:01:06,030
That's so good.

5166
04:01:07,190 --> 04:01:07,530
Yay!

5167
04:01:09,210 --> 04:01:09,750
Yes!

5168
04:01:10,110 --> 04:01:11,650
You recreated another scene.

5169
04:01:12,430 --> 04:01:12,970
Yes!

5170
04:01:13,390 --> 04:01:14,330
Yes, I did.

5171
04:01:15,570 --> 04:01:17,010
What was he doing inside?

5172
04:01:17,290 --> 04:01:17,830
Snapping?

5173
04:01:18,070 --> 04:01:18,290
Probably.

5174
04:01:20,370 --> 04:01:23,350
Actually though, isn't it like super uncomfortable inside tanks?

5175
04:01:23,690 --> 04:01:25,890
It's like super cramped and hot.

5176
04:01:31,650 --> 04:01:32,130
Okay.

5177
04:01:32,610 --> 04:01:34,070
I think we've done all we can do.

5178
04:01:39,580 --> 04:01:40,460
Very hot.

5179
04:01:41,640 --> 04:01:44,450
I don't!

5180
04:01:44,630 --> 04:01:45,770
Kaz, I can't do it!

5181
04:01:45,950 --> 04:01:46,830
I can't do it!

5182
04:01:47,630 --> 04:01:48,110
Okay.

5183
04:01:48,370 --> 04:01:49,130
I think it is up here.

5184
04:01:49,330 --> 04:01:50,090
Up there?

5185
04:01:50,710 --> 04:01:51,710
I have to go too?

5186
04:01:51,890 --> 04:01:52,030
Maybe.

5187
04:01:54,850 --> 04:01:55,210
Maybe.

5188
04:01:55,770 --> 04:01:58,570
Oh yeah, these guys are gone now because I killed them.

5189
04:01:59,410 --> 04:02:00,230
Oh, oh, this way.

5190
04:02:05,360 --> 04:02:07,860
I was like, oh no, wait, I'm going to get caught by the spotlight.

5191
04:02:09,240 --> 04:02:09,820
Everybody's dead.

5192
04:02:13,840 --> 04:02:14,440
Everybody's dead.

5193
04:02:16,680 --> 04:02:18,480
It's cramped, but not as bad as you think.

5194
04:02:22,140 --> 04:02:23,800
Wait, can I control the spotlight?

5195
04:02:25,440 --> 04:02:28,640
Wait, let's sneak it up.

5196
04:02:30,360 --> 04:02:32,220
Now I'm playing Metal Gear.

5197
04:02:38,310 --> 04:02:39,490
You killed everybody.

5198
04:02:45,690 --> 04:02:47,190
Is this where you need me to go?

5199
04:02:48,130 --> 04:02:49,270
Oh my god.

5200
04:02:51,930 --> 04:02:54,030
Ah, that's where the pistol is.

5201
04:02:55,910 --> 04:02:57,190
Wait, where's the gold?

5202
04:03:00,490 --> 04:03:01,610
Oh, it's...

5203
04:03:01,990 --> 04:03:02,530
In there?

5204
04:03:03,990 --> 04:03:04,810
Down there?

5205
04:03:07,960 --> 04:03:08,780
Right there?

5206
04:03:13,430 --> 04:03:14,750
Can I jump from here?

5207
04:03:14,890 --> 04:03:15,830
Or am I going to get hurt?

5208
04:03:16,590 --> 04:03:17,410
Let's try it.

5209
04:03:19,390 --> 04:03:20,530
Oh, wow.

5210
04:03:21,470 --> 04:03:23,210
Snake's got sturdy knees.

5211
04:03:24,530 --> 04:03:25,430
What's in here?

5212
04:03:26,190 --> 04:03:27,910
Wait, I don't think I've ever noticed this before.

5213
04:03:29,050 --> 04:03:31,170
Those mice are Alaskan field mice.

5214
04:03:31,650 --> 04:03:32,550
Uh, no.

5215
04:03:32,850 --> 04:03:33,650
No, they're not.

5216
04:03:33,790 --> 04:03:34,250
No, they're not.

5217
04:03:34,410 --> 04:03:34,730
Master.

5218
04:03:36,170 --> 04:03:37,050
How are you feeling?

5219
04:03:37,150 --> 04:03:37,370
Okay.

5220
04:03:39,990 --> 04:03:41,050
No way, that's the exit.

5221
04:03:44,770 --> 04:03:45,250
Oh!

5222
04:03:45,770 --> 04:03:46,650
I did it!

5223
04:03:50,310 --> 04:03:51,570
Oh, I did it.

5224
04:03:51,570 --> 04:03:52,610
I'm a genius.

5225
04:03:54,090 --> 04:03:55,870
Sea for sea.

5226
04:03:56,210 --> 04:03:57,550
You created a lot of...

5227
04:03:57,550 --> 04:03:58,570
Scenes!

5228
04:04:02,150 --> 04:04:04,230
You created a lot of...

5229
04:04:04,230 --> 04:04:04,530
Scenes!

5230
04:04:07,390 --> 04:04:09,950
Oh my god, Kiefer Sutherland having to say master.

5231
04:04:11,650 --> 04:04:12,530
Wonder how he...

5232
04:04:12,530 --> 04:04:12,570
Wonder how he...

5233
04:04:12,570 --> 04:04:12,790
Yes, sir.

5234
04:04:13,250 --> 04:04:13,750
Yes.

5235
04:04:14,210 --> 04:04:15,330
He made it to the goal.

5236
04:04:16,290 --> 04:04:17,190
What's that, sir?

5237
04:04:17,750 --> 04:04:19,990
There's those scenes left to recreate.

5238
04:04:21,210 --> 04:04:22,070
Yes, sir.

5239
04:04:22,330 --> 04:04:23,070
Yes, sir.

5240
04:04:23,530 --> 04:04:24,890
Yes, I...

5241
04:04:24,890 --> 04:04:25,850
No, sir.

5242
04:04:26,450 --> 04:04:26,830
Understood.

5243
04:04:28,510 --> 04:04:29,150
I

5244
04:04:37,910 --> 04:04:39,790
wanna know what happens if you...

5245
04:04:40,910 --> 04:04:43,130
If you complete all of them!

5246
04:04:46,390 --> 04:04:47,470
Yes, sir.

5247
04:04:48,570 --> 04:04:49,290
No, sir.

5248
04:04:50,190 --> 04:04:51,730
Is this Kai's pretending to be awesome?

5249
04:04:52,310 --> 04:04:52,610
Yeah!

5250
04:04:52,610 --> 04:04:52,770
Yeah!

5251
04:04:55,810 --> 04:04:57,690
Oh my god, best ever.

5252
04:05:00,430 --> 04:05:01,510
That's so good.

5253
04:05:02,090 --> 04:05:02,770
But I think...

5254
04:05:03,430 --> 04:05:05,410
Actually, if I...

5255
04:05:05,410 --> 04:05:06,050
Hold on.

5256
04:05:06,530 --> 04:05:08,250
I'm just gonna go into it real quick.

5257
04:05:08,390 --> 04:05:09,970
I'm not gonna actually do it.

5258
04:05:10,130 --> 04:05:11,890
I do wanna see if it changed, though.

5259
04:05:12,330 --> 04:05:13,290
Yeah, we didn't get the quiz.

5260
04:05:13,370 --> 04:05:14,930
Probably because...

5261
04:05:14,930 --> 04:05:16,870
We didn't complete all the scenes.

5262
04:05:19,350 --> 04:05:19,750
Hmm...

5263
04:05:19,750 --> 04:05:20,850
We didn't get the quiz!

5264
04:05:23,150 --> 04:05:23,550
Hmm...

5265
04:05:24,350 --> 04:05:24,750
Hmm...

5266
04:05:24,750 --> 04:05:25,830
Yeah, usually...

5267
04:05:25,830 --> 04:05:28,850
There's like a quiz at the end that, uh...

5268
04:05:33,070 --> 04:05:34,890
I wanna see if it's changed at all, though.

5269
04:05:36,930 --> 04:05:38,770
A pseudo-historical recreation.

5270
04:05:43,240 --> 04:05:44,780
Hold on, I'm gonna skip it, sorry.

5271
04:05:45,020 --> 04:05:46,100
Oh, you can't skip it.

5272
04:05:46,220 --> 04:05:46,720
It's like...

5273
04:05:46,720 --> 04:05:47,540
No, this is peak.

5274
04:05:48,160 --> 04:05:49,320
You're not allowed to skip.

5275
04:05:49,460 --> 04:05:49,940
It's so...

5276
04:05:49,940 --> 04:05:50,780
It's so ISO.

5277
04:05:53,780 --> 04:05:57,620
At one point, there was Kaz pretending to be Liquid pretending to be Kaz.

5278
04:05:57,980 --> 04:05:58,400
You're right!

5279
04:05:59,580 --> 04:06:00,660
Kept you waiting, huh?

5280
04:06:01,020 --> 04:06:01,340
Yeah!

5281
04:06:04,220 --> 04:06:05,040
Oh my god.

5282
04:06:17,780 --> 04:06:18,260
Yippee!

5283
04:06:19,880 --> 04:06:22,000
Now I'm annoyed that I didn't get it.

5284
04:06:23,260 --> 04:06:23,740
I'm...

5285
04:06:23,740 --> 04:06:24,940
I'm disappointed in myself.

5286
04:06:25,340 --> 04:06:27,660
I've uploaded some photos to your iDroid.

5287
04:06:27,920 --> 04:06:31,820
Use them as clues to find the locations they show, and recreate the scenes they did.

5288
04:06:31,820 --> 04:06:33,160
I would say...

5289
04:06:34,100 --> 04:06:35,180
I would say...

5290
04:06:36,240 --> 04:06:39,580
That I could, like, do this quickly, but I really don't think I can.

5291
04:06:40,640 --> 04:06:42,260
Even if I know where everything is...

5292
04:06:42,260 --> 04:06:43,420
Shadow Moses Island.

5293
04:06:43,640 --> 04:06:46,080
A remote island off the coast of Alaska.

5294
04:06:46,860 --> 04:06:48,800
Oh no, the guys aren't changed.

5295
04:06:51,060 --> 04:06:51,400
Um...

5296
04:06:51,400 --> 04:06:54,200
You can get them to change into Shadow Moses people.

5297
04:06:56,980 --> 04:06:58,160
You got this?

5298
04:06:59,020 --> 04:07:00,660
Just don't kill everybody.

5299
04:07:01,640 --> 04:07:03,040
Easier said than done.

5300
04:07:04,640 --> 04:07:05,140
Um...

5301
04:07:05,140 --> 04:07:05,620
Um...

5302
04:07:05,620 --> 04:07:08,620
As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.

5303
04:07:09,100 --> 04:07:10,820
Weapons and equipment OSP.

5304
04:07:11,140 --> 04:07:12,000
Maybe we can...

5305
04:07:13,280 --> 04:07:14,940
Maybe we can get...

5306
04:07:16,920 --> 04:07:17,420
Um...

5307
04:07:17,910 --> 04:07:19,240
The one...

5308
04:07:19,240 --> 04:07:20,060
Did I say...

5309
04:07:20,060 --> 04:07:21,120
Did I say thank you, Jesse?

5310
04:07:21,300 --> 04:07:23,200
Sorry, my brain is a little fuzzy right now.

5311
04:07:23,200 --> 04:07:24,800
Thank you so much for the farm, Captain!

5312
04:07:24,960 --> 04:07:25,280
Thank you!

5313
04:07:25,780 --> 04:07:26,180
Um...

5314
04:07:26,180 --> 04:07:28,340
Maybe we can try and get the helicopter first.

5315
04:07:28,680 --> 04:07:29,260
You know?

5316
04:07:31,100 --> 04:07:32,180
Was there anything in here?

5317
04:07:32,240 --> 04:07:33,580
Oh, there were some magazines in here.

5318
04:07:34,620 --> 04:07:36,140
Yeah, let's grab that at least.

5319
04:07:36,180 --> 04:07:36,940
So we have some...

5320
04:07:36,940 --> 04:07:37,580
Even though...

5321
04:07:37,580 --> 04:07:38,400
It didn't even...

5322
04:07:38,400 --> 04:07:40,700
I tried to throw the magazine before to distract...

5323
04:07:40,700 --> 04:07:42,520
To distract the guy, and...

5324
04:07:42,520 --> 04:07:44,380
He completely ignored me.

5325
04:07:49,320 --> 04:07:50,560
Completely ignored me.

5326
04:07:54,600 --> 04:07:55,000
Blah...

5327
04:07:55,000 --> 04:07:55,720
Blah...

5328
04:07:58,720 --> 04:07:58,900
Blah...

5329
04:07:58,900 --> 04:07:59,260
Blah...

5330
04:07:59,260 --> 04:07:59,360
Blah...

5331
04:07:59,360 --> 04:08:01,040
There's only 16 guys on the base.

5332
04:08:01,600 --> 04:08:03,620
No wonder it was so easy to kill everybody.

5333
04:08:09,230 --> 04:08:11,430
How do I get the other guy to come over, though?

5334
04:08:12,370 --> 04:08:13,390
Oh no, they're right there!

5335
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:17,400
Okay.

5336
04:08:18,300 --> 04:08:19,640
Uh, so once I get this...

5337
04:08:19,640 --> 04:08:20,500
I can kill everybody.

5338
04:08:30,920 --> 04:08:31,720
Ah, there it is.

5339
04:08:34,180 --> 04:08:35,540
Now we can kill everybody!

5340
04:08:38,040 --> 04:08:42,810
Wait, I think I also need the...

5341
04:08:42,810 --> 04:08:44,270
Just like old times.

5342
04:08:44,990 --> 04:08:45,550
I think...

5343
04:08:45,550 --> 04:08:48,550
Just what I expect from the legendary snake.

5344
04:08:48,970 --> 04:08:50,670
Why is he saying it like that?

5345
04:08:51,590 --> 04:08:53,370
I think I also...

5346
04:08:53,370 --> 04:08:53,650
Oh.

5347
04:08:54,630 --> 04:08:55,370
Who noticed me?

5348
04:08:55,450 --> 04:08:55,770
That guy?

5349
04:08:55,970 --> 04:08:56,470
No, sir.

5350
04:08:57,690 --> 04:08:58,890
I think I also...

5351
04:08:58,890 --> 04:08:59,990
Sorry, I keep...

5352
04:08:59,990 --> 04:09:00,870
My...

5353
04:09:00,870 --> 04:09:01,890
The medicine.

5354
04:09:02,350 --> 04:09:02,910
Um...

5355
04:09:02,910 --> 04:09:04,630
I think I also need to get the...

5356
04:09:04,630 --> 04:09:05,270
Spotlight one.

5357
04:09:06,650 --> 04:09:07,090
With...

5358
04:09:07,090 --> 04:09:08,130
Without killing people.

5359
04:09:08,570 --> 04:09:08,970
Just...

5360
04:09:08,970 --> 04:09:09,110
Yet.

5361
04:09:09,470 --> 04:09:09,890
Hand grenade.

5362
04:09:10,190 --> 04:09:10,630
We'll take that.

5363
04:09:12,110 --> 04:09:12,550
Uh...

5364
04:09:12,550 --> 04:09:12,950
What are you?

5365
04:09:13,470 --> 04:09:13,690
Oh.

5366
04:09:13,890 --> 04:09:14,610
The shoddy.

5367
04:09:14,730 --> 04:09:15,350
We'll take you.

5368
04:09:25,660 --> 04:09:26,100
Yup.

5369
04:09:26,540 --> 04:09:26,700
Yup.

5370
04:09:27,220 --> 04:09:28,280
Maybe we can get it.

5371
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:28,780
You know what?

5372
04:09:28,800 --> 04:09:29,160
I believe.

5373
04:09:31,080 --> 04:09:31,780
Even if...

5374
04:09:31,780 --> 04:09:33,220
Even if it's not a first try then.

5375
04:09:33,220 --> 04:09:33,620
Haha.

5376
04:09:34,540 --> 04:09:34,760
Oh my god.

5377
04:09:34,880 --> 04:09:35,920
Please snake go inside.

5378
04:09:36,540 --> 04:09:36,980
There we go.

5379
04:09:42,920 --> 04:09:43,240
Master.

5380
04:09:51,580 --> 04:09:53,300
Didn't you get it when you picked up the thing first time?

5381
04:09:53,380 --> 04:09:54,860
Do I not have to get all of them again?

5382
04:09:55,520 --> 04:09:56,020
Or no?

5383
04:09:58,180 --> 04:10:00,140
Don't I have to get all of the...

5384
04:10:00,540 --> 04:10:01,080
Scenes again?

5385
04:10:04,260 --> 04:10:04,660
Like...

5386
04:10:04,660 --> 04:10:05,200
Complete.

5387
04:10:06,160 --> 04:10:07,360
You have to get them again.

5388
04:10:07,760 --> 04:10:08,100
Yeah, yeah.

5389
04:10:13,860 --> 04:10:14,840
Check the eye droid.

5390
04:10:15,080 --> 04:10:15,780
That's a good idea.

5391
04:10:17,480 --> 04:10:17,860
Oops.

5392
04:10:19,860 --> 04:10:20,860
I'm pretty sure...

5393
04:10:20,860 --> 04:10:21,860
I'm pretty sure this is...

5394
04:10:21,860 --> 04:10:23,520
If you want to finish the mission, head for the goal.

5395
04:10:23,700 --> 04:10:24,940
I've marked it on your map.

5396
04:10:25,400 --> 04:10:25,780
Yeah, yeah.

5397
04:10:27,640 --> 04:10:28,500
A hundred percent.

5398
04:10:28,800 --> 04:10:30,540
A hundred percent I have to do it.

5399
04:10:31,300 --> 04:10:31,780
So...

5400
04:10:32,260 --> 04:10:32,920
Let's see.

5401
04:10:52,430 --> 04:10:53,610
Get the sleepy gun.

5402
04:10:53,770 --> 04:10:54,470
I'm working on it.

5403
04:10:54,850 --> 04:10:56,510
You know it's all the way up there.

5404
04:10:57,010 --> 04:10:57,910
Go investigate.

5405
04:11:00,310 --> 04:11:01,250
Go investigate.

5406
04:11:01,250 --> 04:11:01,870
Thank you.

5407
04:11:04,350 --> 04:11:05,090
Oh, shoot.

5408
04:11:14,260 --> 04:11:15,220
I hate...

5409
04:11:16,440 --> 04:11:16,920
Oh,

5410
04:11:29,520 --> 04:11:30,080
I have a gun now.

5411
04:11:30,160 --> 04:11:30,480
That's right.

5412
04:11:34,770 --> 04:11:35,950
I have a gun now.

5413
04:11:37,130 --> 04:11:38,010
Fox, die!

5414
04:11:39,970 --> 04:11:40,450
Oh.

5415
04:11:41,890 --> 04:11:42,370
Okay.

5416
04:11:44,390 --> 04:11:45,990
I don't think anybody would come down here.

5417
04:11:47,170 --> 04:11:48,090
Don't kill everyone.

5418
04:11:50,330 --> 04:11:50,970
I could.

5419
04:12:00,570 --> 04:12:02,950
I don't have to get an S in this, do I?

5420
04:12:03,730 --> 04:12:05,450
If so, I'm not gonna...

5421
04:12:05,450 --> 04:12:06,730
I'm not gonna, you know...

5422
04:12:07,690 --> 04:12:09,570
I don't play to get ranks, you guys.

5423
04:12:09,710 --> 04:12:10,590
I just play for fun.

5424
04:12:10,590 --> 04:12:11,850
Another prisoner.

5425
04:12:12,310 --> 04:12:13,490
Looks like he's alive.

5426
04:12:15,330 --> 04:12:16,690
Yeah, you don't have to get an S.

5427
04:12:16,810 --> 04:12:16,950
Yeah.

5428
04:12:17,170 --> 04:12:18,310
I just like to play for fun.

5429
04:12:25,580 --> 04:12:26,500
Just the scenes.

5430
04:12:27,740 --> 04:12:28,720
You can throw...

5431
04:12:28,720 --> 04:12:30,080
You can stun cameras by throwing a mag...

5432
04:12:30,080 --> 04:12:30,980
You can?

5433
04:12:31,460 --> 04:12:33,200
Throw a mag at them during slow-mo?

5434
04:12:33,300 --> 04:12:34,000
I had no idea.

5435
04:12:34,840 --> 04:12:35,920
Oh, that's huge.

5436
04:12:36,100 --> 04:12:36,460
Thank you.

5437
04:12:50,740 --> 04:12:52,540
I'm feeling like him right now.

5438
04:12:58,960 --> 04:12:59,660
Bye-bye.

5439
04:13:00,340 --> 04:13:02,000
Resuming normal patrol.

5440
04:13:02,380 --> 04:13:05,280
A man is dead and you're resuming normal patrol.

5441
04:13:14,850 --> 04:13:16,690
I don't think there was anybody down here.

5442
04:13:19,970 --> 04:13:21,150
Bye-bye.

5443
04:13:29,460 --> 04:13:33,200
You can stun guards in slow-mo by throwing snake's cake to them.

5444
04:13:36,760 --> 04:13:37,960
Nice work.

5445
04:13:38,220 --> 04:13:38,820
Thank you.

5446
04:13:40,380 --> 04:13:41,640
I like the praise.

5447
04:13:54,910 --> 04:13:56,390
Isn't there a guy around there?

5448
04:13:56,910 --> 04:13:57,750
Hello, little mouse.

5449
04:13:58,490 --> 04:13:59,850
Hello, little mouse.

5450
04:14:00,750 --> 04:14:02,730
Oh, there's an armory right there.

5451
04:14:04,790 --> 04:14:05,890
Very interesting.

5452
04:14:17,860 --> 04:14:19,260
Maybe that worked.

5453
04:14:22,900 --> 04:14:24,020
If not...

5454
04:14:26,600 --> 04:14:27,900
Oh, that totally worked.

5455
04:14:30,680 --> 04:14:32,240
Wait, I don't want him to see me though.

5456
04:14:36,440 --> 04:14:37,280
I don't...

5457
04:14:37,280 --> 04:14:39,020
Can you jump dive in this game?

5458
04:14:39,880 --> 04:14:41,260
Or is that only in V?

5459
04:14:47,810 --> 04:14:49,970
Can I get in there without him seeing me?

5460
04:14:52,330 --> 04:14:53,350
Is the question...

5461
04:14:54,570 --> 04:14:55,370
I think so.

5462
04:14:56,070 --> 04:14:56,590
You can?

5463
04:14:56,830 --> 04:14:57,670
X or square?

5464
04:14:59,030 --> 04:14:59,490
Really?

5465
04:14:59,650 --> 04:15:00,540
Okay, I'll try it.

5466
04:15:08,520 --> 04:15:09,660
Wait, this got a...

5467
04:15:09,660 --> 04:15:10,960
This got a suppressor on it.

5468
04:15:13,060 --> 04:15:13,880
Wait, what do you mean?

5469
04:15:13,880 --> 04:15:14,800
I wonder what it's used for.

5470
04:15:15,240 --> 04:15:15,540
Oh!

5471
04:15:16,140 --> 04:15:16,660
Wait.

5472
04:15:17,780 --> 04:15:18,080
It disappeared.

5473
04:15:19,730 --> 04:15:22,750
I'll tell you why, but it looks like that gun's light erased the marking.

5474
04:15:23,210 --> 04:15:25,050
You see any more of those things around there?

5475
04:15:25,430 --> 04:15:25,950
Oh!

5476
04:15:26,350 --> 04:15:26,670
Oh!

5477
04:15:27,990 --> 04:15:29,530
I forgot about this.

5478
04:15:30,370 --> 04:15:30,630
Oh!

5479
04:15:33,190 --> 04:15:34,550
Wait, but my shot good.

5480
04:15:34,550 --> 04:15:34,770
What did I do?

5481
04:15:38,490 --> 04:15:39,290
My shotty.

5482
04:15:40,750 --> 04:15:42,450
Just remember that it's in there, everybody.

5483
04:15:44,170 --> 04:15:45,230
Well, that guy just...

5484
04:15:45,230 --> 04:15:46,070
That guy just left.

5485
04:15:47,630 --> 04:15:48,210
Oh, dang it.

5486
04:15:48,250 --> 04:15:49,030
I didn't get to mark him.

5487
04:15:50,330 --> 04:15:52,330
No, I had no clue that he would leave though.

5488
04:15:55,130 --> 04:15:56,710
Looks like that's nothing special.

5489
04:15:57,580 --> 04:15:58,250
What do you mean?

5490
04:15:58,890 --> 04:15:59,470
What?

5491
04:16:03,160 --> 04:16:04,320
The disrespect.

5492
04:16:06,700 --> 04:16:07,860
The disrespect!

5493
04:16:09,840 --> 04:16:11,900
Wait, I only know where two are though.

5494
04:16:24,640 --> 04:16:26,720
You guys wanna help me with the other ones?

5495
04:16:42,640 --> 04:16:44,000
Yes, I did.

5496
04:16:45,400 --> 04:16:45,920
Don't get on.

5497
04:16:46,080 --> 04:16:47,300
We'll investigate ASAP.

5498
04:16:47,540 --> 04:16:47,900
Ouch.

5499
04:16:50,440 --> 04:16:51,380
Wait, should I have...

5500
04:16:51,380 --> 04:16:52,340
These are still on, no?

5501
04:16:56,940 --> 04:16:57,920
One is at the start.

5502
04:16:58,100 --> 04:16:59,220
That's the ghost babble one, right?

5503
04:17:04,200 --> 04:17:04,700
Oh, wait.

5504
04:17:04,900 --> 04:17:06,220
I think I need to leave this one alone.

5505
04:17:06,500 --> 04:17:07,640
I need these guys...

5506
04:17:10,320 --> 04:17:10,680
Conscious?

5507
04:17:10,800 --> 04:17:11,440
I can't tell.

5508
04:17:12,660 --> 04:17:14,860
I don't know if I need these guys alive or not.

5509
04:17:15,520 --> 04:17:17,020
You don't need the guys to do the scene.

5510
04:17:17,120 --> 04:17:17,520
I don't!

5511
04:17:17,660 --> 04:17:18,000
Oh, okay.

5512
04:17:28,860 --> 04:17:29,300
Yeah!

5513
04:17:30,200 --> 04:17:30,640
Okay.

5514
04:17:31,560 --> 04:17:32,640
Hope you're having fun!

5515
04:17:32,940 --> 04:17:33,560
At work now!

5516
04:17:34,040 --> 04:17:35,020
Oh, Neo Cerberus!

5517
04:17:35,080 --> 04:17:35,860
Have a good day at work!

5518
04:17:40,440 --> 04:17:41,660
Set the light myself?

5519
04:17:41,980 --> 04:17:42,400
Oh, okay.

5520
04:17:44,640 --> 04:17:45,680
That's a little tricky.

5521
04:17:46,020 --> 04:17:46,980
Wait, it's kind of set.

5522
04:17:59,780 --> 04:18:00,380
Thank you.

5523
04:18:00,380 --> 04:18:01,460
It has been updated.

5524
04:18:02,060 --> 04:18:02,780
Okay.

5525
04:18:04,420 --> 04:18:05,460
Nice boss.

5526
04:18:05,720 --> 04:18:06,040
Thank you!

5527
04:18:09,520 --> 04:18:10,580
I'm gonna put them...

5528
04:18:10,580 --> 04:18:12,080
I'm gonna take them out with the...

5529
04:18:12,740 --> 04:18:14,200
With our little...

5530
04:18:14,520 --> 04:18:15,400
That pistol.

5531
04:18:18,480 --> 04:18:18,840
Yup.

5532
04:18:25,080 --> 04:18:25,480
Okay.

5533
04:18:25,480 --> 04:18:25,740
Nice.

5534
04:18:29,070 --> 04:18:29,930
And you.

5535
04:18:35,070 --> 04:18:37,250
And we crawl, crawl, crawl...

5536
04:18:37,250 --> 04:18:38,330
We crawl, crawl...

5537
04:18:38,330 --> 04:18:38,470
Oh.

5538
04:18:38,730 --> 04:18:39,770
I'm not close enough.

5539
04:18:40,410 --> 04:18:42,410
We crawl, crawl, crawl...

5540
04:18:43,370 --> 04:18:43,870
Oh,

5541
04:19:02,210 --> 04:19:03,290
you son of a gun.

5542
04:19:04,870 --> 04:19:06,370
Don't turn the lines back on!

5543
04:19:06,370 --> 04:19:06,710
Come on!

5544
04:19:11,850 --> 04:19:13,130
Is he gonna come up here?

5545
04:19:19,120 --> 04:19:19,840
You jerk.

5546
04:19:21,160 --> 04:19:22,260
You'll pay for this.

5547
04:19:23,800 --> 04:19:24,840
You'll pay for this.

5548
04:19:26,440 --> 04:19:27,640
Wait, is he coming up here for real?

5549
04:19:30,080 --> 04:19:31,360
Oh, I can just get him then.

5550
04:19:33,340 --> 04:19:33,940
Oh, nope.

5551
04:19:36,500 --> 04:19:37,160
What is he doing?

5552
04:19:37,280 --> 04:19:37,700
Oh, he is!

5553
04:19:48,290 --> 04:19:49,450
He yelled so...

5554
04:19:50,570 --> 04:19:51,090
Fast!

5555
04:19:52,470 --> 04:19:54,430
Your reflexes are crazy, mister!

5556
04:19:55,170 --> 04:19:55,870
Are you still alive?

5557
04:20:02,540 --> 04:20:03,880
Hold on, I forgot to check.

5558
04:20:04,120 --> 04:20:05,720
Or I forgot to position these, I think.

5559
04:20:06,020 --> 04:20:06,320
Oh no!

5560
04:20:06,460 --> 04:20:07,160
Look at that!

5561
04:20:07,380 --> 04:20:08,500
I'm such a genius!

5562
04:20:11,300 --> 04:20:12,460
I'm such a genius!

5563
04:20:13,940 --> 04:20:15,460
They're perfectly positioned.

5564
04:20:17,180 --> 04:20:18,420
Gravity takes another.

5565
04:20:18,760 --> 04:20:19,280
I...

5566
04:20:19,280 --> 04:20:20,300
That was not my fault.

5567
04:20:24,380 --> 04:20:24,820
100%.

5568
04:20:34,420 --> 04:20:35,920
I gotta get this other guy though.

5569
04:20:37,760 --> 04:20:39,320
I gotta get this other guy though.

5570
04:20:39,680 --> 04:20:40,440
What else are we...

5571
04:20:40,440 --> 04:20:41,580
Hold on, let me...

5572
04:20:41,580 --> 04:20:43,440
Get this other guy and then I'll...

5573
04:20:44,380 --> 04:20:45,980
He died in his sleep.

5574
04:20:46,360 --> 04:20:48,060
He died doing what he loved.

5575
04:20:48,740 --> 04:20:49,180
Sleeping.

5576
04:20:52,320 --> 04:20:53,240
I'm an...

5577
04:20:53,240 --> 04:20:54,640
I am an innocent ghost.

5578
04:20:55,060 --> 04:20:55,480
He he he.

5579
04:20:56,800 --> 04:20:57,840
I am innocent.

5580
04:20:58,540 --> 04:20:59,960
I am innocent.

5581
04:21:00,440 --> 04:21:00,480
I am innocent.

5582
04:21:00,480 --> 04:21:01,260
Innocent ghost.

5583
04:21:02,040 --> 04:21:03,460
Uh, uh, uh.

5584
04:21:09,240 --> 04:21:10,680
Okay, maybe that'll work.

5585
04:21:13,620 --> 04:21:14,340
Right?

5586
04:21:14,860 --> 04:21:15,880
Go to sleep!

5587
04:21:15,880 --> 04:21:16,720
Nice.

5588
04:21:20,800 --> 04:21:21,700
You alright?

5589
04:21:22,000 --> 04:21:22,720
Oh shoot.

5590
04:21:23,360 --> 04:21:23,560
Wait!

5591
04:21:23,700 --> 04:21:24,320
I caught you though!

5592
04:21:24,600 --> 04:21:25,520
Please fall asleep!

5593
04:21:27,000 --> 04:21:27,960
Almost there.

5594
04:21:28,680 --> 04:21:29,640
Please fall asleep.

5595
04:21:31,480 --> 04:21:32,320
Get up.

5596
04:21:37,950 --> 04:21:38,550
Um...

5597
04:21:38,550 --> 04:21:39,390
I think I messed up.

5598
04:21:49,450 --> 04:21:50,550
Please fall asleep.

5599
04:21:58,180 --> 04:21:58,740
Oh.

5600
04:21:59,580 --> 04:22:00,140
Oh.

5601
04:22:00,200 --> 04:22:00,560
Oh he noticed.

5602
04:22:01,580 --> 04:22:02,820
What the hell is this?

5603
04:22:03,600 --> 04:22:04,660
I know, crazy right?

5604
04:22:06,460 --> 04:22:07,360
What are you doing?

5605
04:22:09,740 --> 04:22:11,540
Oh, you are going to check on him.

5606
04:22:12,040 --> 04:22:13,480
I was like, do you hate this guy or something?

5607
04:22:16,460 --> 04:22:16,860
Okay.

5608
04:22:17,620 --> 04:22:18,800
Oh, holy am.

5609
04:22:21,400 --> 04:22:22,160
Is that it?

5610
04:22:22,280 --> 04:22:23,920
Yeah, I already recreated that scene.

5611
04:22:23,920 --> 04:22:24,520
So we're okay.

5612
04:22:32,430 --> 04:22:32,830
Yippee!

5613
04:22:39,580 --> 04:22:40,960
If only it were a chaff.

5614
04:22:42,400 --> 04:22:44,180
That's another scene recreated.

5615
04:22:44,500 --> 04:22:44,880
Okay.

5616
04:22:45,060 --> 04:22:45,180
Nice work.

5617
04:22:45,620 --> 04:22:46,300
Thank you!

5618
04:22:47,480 --> 04:22:48,000
Okay.

5619
04:22:48,420 --> 04:22:48,680
Okay.

5620
04:22:48,940 --> 04:22:49,120
Okay.

5621
04:22:49,540 --> 04:22:49,720
Okay.

5622
04:22:50,280 --> 04:22:50,800
Uh...

5623
04:22:51,380 --> 04:22:52,500
What else we got?

5624
04:22:55,420 --> 04:22:56,400
A soldier?

5625
04:22:56,860 --> 04:22:57,820
And a tank?

5626
04:22:59,000 --> 04:23:00,320
A soldier and a tank?

5627
04:23:00,560 --> 04:23:01,460
And the car!

5628
04:23:01,620 --> 04:23:03,200
Oh, we can do the car maybe right now.

5629
04:23:11,850 --> 04:23:12,590
I don't...

5630
04:23:12,590 --> 04:23:13,550
Yeah, there's nobody up there.

5631
04:23:13,710 --> 04:23:14,510
There's only this guy.

5632
04:23:16,570 --> 04:23:17,890
I don't think he'll notice.

5633
04:23:19,590 --> 04:23:21,090
I don't think he'll notice.

5634
04:23:21,670 --> 04:23:22,090
Probably.

5635
04:23:23,750 --> 04:23:24,350
Probably.

5636
04:23:25,110 --> 04:23:25,590
Oh yeah!

5637
04:23:25,790 --> 04:23:27,170
Where did I get grenades from?

5638
04:23:28,390 --> 04:23:29,210
In here?

5639
04:23:33,090 --> 04:23:33,690
Uh...

5640
04:23:33,690 --> 04:23:35,930
I wonder if the smoke grenade will work.

5641
04:23:38,830 --> 04:23:41,170
I think you can get grenades in any of these, no?

5642
04:23:43,490 --> 04:23:44,490
I lied.

5643
04:23:44,910 --> 04:23:45,410
Yikes.

5644
04:23:47,190 --> 04:23:47,690
Uh...

5645
04:23:48,230 --> 04:23:49,130
Armory near...

5646
04:23:49,130 --> 04:23:50,710
Armory near the tank!

5647
04:23:50,830 --> 04:23:51,230
Okay, okay.

5648
04:23:53,910 --> 04:23:58,030
I have smoke grenades, but I don't know if they work as well, you know?

5649
04:24:03,260 --> 04:24:03,780
Keys!

5650
04:24:05,460 --> 04:24:06,900
What was that, guys?

5651
04:24:07,300 --> 04:24:08,680
Pretending to be...

5652
04:24:10,120 --> 04:24:10,640
Alright!

5653
04:24:11,200 --> 04:24:11,520
Keys!

5654
04:24:13,200 --> 04:24:14,080
Almost there.

5655
04:24:14,880 --> 04:24:17,520
We also have to do the marking, I just realized.

5656
04:24:18,840 --> 04:24:19,240
The Koj...

5657
04:24:19,240 --> 04:24:20,400
Or the Kojima one...

5658
04:24:20,400 --> 04:24:22,220
Kojima marking is not...

5659
04:24:22,640 --> 04:24:23,560
Anything special, maybe?

5660
04:24:26,380 --> 04:24:27,560
Oh my god.

5661
04:24:27,720 --> 04:24:28,560
Oh my god, get out of the car.

5662
04:24:28,560 --> 04:24:29,620
Get out of the car.

5663
04:24:30,100 --> 04:24:30,620
Go, go, go, go.

5664
04:24:30,860 --> 04:24:31,980
Go, go, go, go, go.

5665
04:24:31,980 --> 04:24:32,040
Go, go, go, go, go.

5666
04:24:32,280 --> 04:24:32,720
Leave.

5667
04:24:33,520 --> 04:24:34,500
Leave this place.

5668
04:24:38,920 --> 04:24:40,160
Not yet, Snake.

5669
04:24:40,620 --> 04:24:41,960
It's not over yet.

5670
04:24:42,920 --> 04:24:44,320
Shining light does nothing, huh?

5671
04:24:44,800 --> 04:24:45,280
What?!

5672
04:24:52,820 --> 04:24:53,780
This is...

5673
04:24:56,720 --> 04:24:57,540
What is this?

5674
04:24:57,820 --> 04:24:58,580
Landing zone?

5675
04:24:58,700 --> 04:24:59,260
Oh, landing zone?

5676
04:25:00,120 --> 04:25:01,300
Logo marking area.

5677
04:25:01,520 --> 04:25:02,200
Marker placed.

5678
04:25:03,640 --> 04:25:04,120
Logo...

5679
04:25:04,120 --> 04:25:05,080
Marker placed.

5680
04:25:05,740 --> 04:25:06,740
There's so many!

5681
04:25:07,500 --> 04:25:08,900
Wait, there's so many!

5682
04:25:09,180 --> 04:25:09,740
Wait, there's so many!

5683
04:25:09,740 --> 04:25:10,060
Holy cow!

5684
04:25:10,620 --> 04:25:11,220
Weapon.

5685
04:25:13,940 --> 04:25:14,980
Like my...

5686
04:25:14,980 --> 04:25:15,440
That's...

5687
04:25:16,120 --> 04:25:16,520
That's...

5688
04:25:18,540 --> 04:25:19,560
Okay, hold on.

5689
04:25:22,980 --> 04:25:23,840
Marker placed.

5690
04:25:24,100 --> 04:25:25,020
Oh, there's one right over here?

5691
04:25:31,710 --> 04:25:32,230
Raven.

5692
04:25:36,300 --> 04:25:36,820
Oof.

5693
04:25:39,340 --> 04:25:39,860
Wait...

5694
04:25:39,860 --> 04:25:40,200
Oh!

5695
04:25:42,780 --> 04:25:43,300
Touch!

5696
04:25:50,400 --> 04:25:52,420
I don't remember if there's a guy up here.

5697
04:25:52,680 --> 04:25:53,660
Oh my god, Johnny.

5698
04:25:53,920 --> 04:25:54,120
Please.

5699
04:25:55,080 --> 04:25:56,300
Johnny, go see a doctor.

5700
04:25:56,640 --> 04:25:56,940
Please!

5701
04:25:57,300 --> 04:25:57,680
My man.

5702
04:26:01,790 --> 04:26:03,190
And then this guy over here.

5703
04:26:05,570 --> 04:26:06,290
Okay.

5704
04:26:08,670 --> 04:26:09,390
Uh...

5705
04:26:09,390 --> 04:26:09,650
You.

5706
04:26:10,010 --> 04:26:10,130
You.

5707
04:26:21,820 --> 04:26:22,700
Grab him.

5708
04:26:23,700 --> 04:26:24,420
Quick!

5709
04:26:24,900 --> 04:26:25,220
Quick!

5710
04:26:25,640 --> 04:26:25,760
Quick!

5711
04:26:26,120 --> 04:26:26,160
Quick!

5712
04:26:27,620 --> 04:26:28,660
And drop him.

5713
04:26:28,860 --> 04:26:29,460
And...

5714
04:26:29,460 --> 04:26:29,580
Hide.

5715
04:26:31,060 --> 04:26:32,120
Oh my god.

5716
04:26:32,340 --> 04:26:33,190
That was so...

5717
04:26:43,710 --> 04:26:46,130
That was so stinking close.

5718
04:26:53,560 --> 04:26:55,640
Alright, where was our next marker?

5719
04:26:56,540 --> 04:26:56,720
Here?

5720
04:26:58,120 --> 04:26:58,740
Or...

5721
04:26:58,740 --> 04:26:59,580
Marker placed.

5722
04:26:59,580 --> 04:27:00,240
Wait...

5723
04:27:00,680 --> 04:27:01,080
I...

5724
04:27:01,080 --> 04:27:01,840
Put the...

5725
04:27:01,840 --> 04:27:02,740
There we go.

5726
04:27:03,460 --> 04:27:03,860
Okay.

5727
04:27:06,340 --> 04:27:08,060
Go back to Babel, there's another logo.

5728
04:27:08,320 --> 04:27:08,760
Oh, there is?

5729
04:27:08,880 --> 04:27:10,040
Okay, I'll go back in a bit.

5730
04:27:24,540 --> 04:27:24,940
Oh...

5731
04:27:24,940 --> 04:27:25,980
Now that we have...

5732
04:27:25,980 --> 04:27:27,740
I don't have very many bullets left, but...

5733
04:27:31,100 --> 04:27:31,900
It's better than...

5734
04:27:39,120 --> 04:27:40,500
It's better than not having it.

5735
04:27:40,500 --> 04:27:41,860
At least since this is quiet.

5736
04:27:48,420 --> 04:27:49,680
No, I don't have grenade...

5737
04:27:49,680 --> 04:27:49,900
I don't...

5738
04:27:49,900 --> 04:27:50,540
I only have...

5739
04:27:50,540 --> 04:27:51,660
You guys, I only have smoke grenades.

5740
04:27:51,940 --> 04:27:52,240
Oh, what?

5741
04:27:52,440 --> 04:27:52,720
What?

5742
04:27:53,100 --> 04:27:54,120
I don't have grenades!

5743
04:27:54,620 --> 04:27:55,800
When did I get those?

5744
04:27:56,160 --> 04:27:56,700
You know what?

5745
04:27:57,580 --> 04:27:58,020
I...

5746
04:27:58,020 --> 04:27:58,420
I...

5747
04:27:58,420 --> 04:27:58,860
I...

5748
04:27:58,860 --> 04:27:59,520
I...

5749
04:27:59,520 --> 04:27:59,700
Sorry.

5750
04:27:59,880 --> 04:28:00,420
I was wrong.

5751
04:28:00,720 --> 04:28:01,320
I was wrong.

5752
04:28:02,200 --> 04:28:04,620
And I am not afraid to admit when I am wrong.

5753
04:28:07,260 --> 04:28:08,080
I was wrong.

5754
04:28:09,580 --> 04:28:10,280
I was...

5755
04:28:10,280 --> 04:28:11,380
I was completely wrong.

5756
04:28:11,600 --> 04:28:12,080
I...

5757
04:28:12,080 --> 04:28:13,560
Completely forgot picking up...

5758
04:28:13,560 --> 04:28:15,760
I think I just picked them up out of habit and...

5759
04:28:15,760 --> 04:28:16,800
Just didn't think about it.

5760
04:28:18,640 --> 04:28:19,120
I...

5761
04:28:19,120 --> 04:28:19,960
I admit fault.

5762
04:28:22,320 --> 04:28:23,520
Is there somebody up here?

5763
04:28:24,380 --> 04:28:25,200
I can't tell.

5764
04:28:25,400 --> 04:28:25,820
Maybe not.

5765
04:28:28,720 --> 04:28:29,720
Maybe we're okay.

5766
04:28:33,900 --> 04:28:35,580
We said some to you in the mail.

5767
04:28:35,960 --> 04:28:37,380
So kind of you.

5768
04:28:37,760 --> 04:28:39,300
Wait, where's the...

5769
04:28:41,160 --> 04:28:42,200
Where's the marker?

5770
04:28:46,340 --> 04:28:47,300
Is it up here?

5771
04:28:53,400 --> 04:28:54,800
Behind the warning sign.

5772
04:28:55,040 --> 04:28:55,060
Oh.

5773
04:28:55,680 --> 04:28:56,000
Oopsie.

5774
04:28:59,430 --> 04:29:00,750
The warning sign.

5775
04:29:00,750 --> 04:29:01,830
It's over here, no?

5776
04:29:05,900 --> 04:29:07,480
You picked up a bunch of stuff all at once.

5777
04:29:07,480 --> 04:29:08,100
The armory.

5778
04:29:11,360 --> 04:29:11,820
Ah!

5779
04:29:12,440 --> 04:29:12,960
I see.

5780
04:29:16,280 --> 04:29:17,260
What is that one?

5781
04:29:18,380 --> 04:29:18,620
Oh!

5782
04:29:18,900 --> 04:29:19,360
Two!

5783
04:29:22,440 --> 04:29:23,500
That one should disappear.

5784
04:29:25,620 --> 04:29:26,080
Oh.

5785
04:29:28,240 --> 04:29:29,660
Did you do the main mission already?

5786
04:29:29,800 --> 04:29:30,320
I did.

5787
04:29:31,180 --> 04:29:31,900
Wait, how do I?

5788
04:29:37,700 --> 04:29:40,320
If you want to finish the mission, head for the road.

5789
04:29:40,380 --> 04:29:40,760
No, Kaz!

5790
04:29:40,780 --> 04:29:43,060
If you want to look for those other scenes, go ahead.

5791
04:29:43,220 --> 04:29:44,300
Kaz, I see it!

5792
04:29:45,840 --> 04:29:47,240
Metal Gear Solid 2.

5793
04:29:47,740 --> 04:29:48,660
Sons of Liberty.

5794
04:29:49,920 --> 04:29:50,600
Thank you.

5795
04:29:51,520 --> 04:29:53,240
Kaz knows how to read, you guys.

5796
04:29:53,820 --> 04:29:54,560
That's so good.

5797
04:29:58,540 --> 04:29:59,620
Keep calling.

5798
04:30:01,040 --> 04:30:02,700
Metal Gear Solid 2.

5799
04:30:02,940 --> 04:30:03,880
Sons of Liberty.

5800
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:08,480
Snake's model was 3800 polygons.

5801
04:30:08,940 --> 04:30:09,340
Wow.

5802
04:30:10,020 --> 04:30:10,620
What are we now?

5803
04:30:11,020 --> 04:30:12,300
Find something to believe in.

5804
04:30:12,420 --> 04:30:13,720
And find it for yourself.

5805
04:30:14,040 --> 04:30:16,540
If you do, pass it on to the future.

5806
04:30:17,040 --> 04:30:18,860
That's not a bad impression.

5807
04:30:20,140 --> 04:30:21,360
Metal Gear Solid 2.

5808
04:30:21,660 --> 04:30:22,780
Sons of Liberty.

5809
04:30:23,040 --> 04:30:25,200
That wasn't a bad impression, I'd say.

5810
04:30:27,780 --> 04:30:28,300
Oh.

5811
04:30:29,880 --> 04:30:30,400
Oh.

5812
04:30:30,400 --> 04:30:31,660
I can actually start killing people.

5813
04:30:31,980 --> 04:30:32,680
Not gonna lie.

5814
04:30:33,320 --> 04:30:35,480
Might make the finding of the rest of them easier.

5815
04:30:39,140 --> 04:30:39,660
No!

5816
04:30:39,800 --> 04:30:40,840
That is not Solid Snake!

5817
04:30:43,460 --> 04:30:43,980
Oh.

5818
04:31:01,910 --> 04:31:02,430
Ah.

5819
04:31:03,950 --> 04:31:06,990
Cause blowing up that one is gonna cause a ruckus.

5820
04:31:08,650 --> 04:31:09,710
And he is asleep.

5821
04:31:12,750 --> 04:31:15,230
Cause impersonating Iroquois Plissken now.

5822
04:31:15,490 --> 04:31:16,230
Cause could never.

5823
04:31:17,550 --> 04:31:19,330
Plissken is a perfect being.

5824
04:31:19,590 --> 04:31:20,290
Nobody could ever.

5825
04:31:21,410 --> 04:31:21,730
Oh.

5826
04:31:22,590 --> 04:31:23,910
You see nothing.

5827
04:31:25,210 --> 04:31:26,450
You see nothing.

5828
04:31:28,510 --> 04:31:29,150
Hey.

5829
04:31:29,350 --> 04:31:31,330
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

5830
04:31:35,920 --> 04:31:36,560
Hey.

5831
04:31:37,280 --> 04:31:37,340
Hey.

5832
04:31:37,820 --> 04:31:38,280
Do something.

5833
04:31:38,280 --> 04:31:39,520
I dare you.

5834
04:31:41,900 --> 04:31:42,840
Yeah, that's right.

5835
04:31:43,540 --> 04:31:44,200
That's right.

5836
04:31:44,460 --> 04:31:45,180
That's stupid.

5837
04:31:48,060 --> 04:31:48,540
Oh.

5838
04:31:48,820 --> 04:31:49,140
Uh, you.

5839
04:31:50,840 --> 04:31:53,100
Meowp, meowp, meowp, meowp, meowp.

5840
04:31:56,140 --> 04:31:56,620
Productions.

5841
04:31:58,160 --> 04:31:59,020
Oh, whoops.

5842
04:31:59,200 --> 04:31:59,980
Uh, Kojima.

5843
04:32:00,300 --> 04:32:00,780
Production.

5844
04:32:01,140 --> 04:32:01,940
Okay, keep it that way.

5845
04:32:03,440 --> 04:32:04,280
Alright.

5846
04:32:12,350 --> 04:32:14,650
How do I get the one behind the...

5847
04:32:23,990 --> 04:32:24,830
Nothing.

5848
04:32:25,710 --> 04:32:26,550
Oh.

5849
04:32:27,630 --> 04:32:28,470
Stop!

5850
04:32:31,570 --> 04:32:32,410
Okay.

5851
04:32:35,310 --> 04:32:36,910
You have to blow up the sign.

5852
04:32:37,350 --> 04:32:38,090
Ah, okay.

5853
04:32:38,090 --> 04:32:38,610
Sources.

5854
04:32:39,190 --> 04:32:42,030
They'll reveal a lot you couldn't see with the naked eye.

5855
04:32:42,290 --> 04:32:43,330
Let's blow it up.

5856
04:32:43,490 --> 04:32:44,910
And then we'll get the...

5857
04:32:44,910 --> 04:32:45,790
We'll do two...

5858
04:32:47,530 --> 04:32:49,250
We'll do two things at once.

5859
04:32:52,270 --> 04:32:53,610
Hopefully nobody heard that.

5860
04:32:54,350 --> 04:32:55,330
Nobody heard that.

5861
04:32:56,250 --> 04:32:56,990
Is that it?

5862
04:32:57,950 --> 04:32:58,390
An

5863
04:33:01,580 --> 04:33:02,020
explosion.

5864
04:33:02,360 --> 04:33:03,020
Damage unknown.

5865
04:33:03,440 --> 04:33:03,700
Over.

5866
04:33:06,890 --> 04:33:07,870
Nobody heard that.

5867
04:33:13,580 --> 04:33:15,060
Do-do-do-doom.

5868
04:33:15,200 --> 04:33:16,480
Bop, bop, bop.

5869
04:33:16,880 --> 04:33:17,860
They heard that.

5870
04:33:18,060 --> 04:33:19,020
Nobody heard it.

5871
04:33:19,480 --> 04:33:19,660
No.

5872
04:33:20,900 --> 04:33:22,200
It's fine if they heard it.

5873
04:33:23,280 --> 04:33:23,360
Oh.

5874
04:33:24,280 --> 04:33:24,700
Great.

5875
04:33:25,000 --> 04:33:26,400
You recreated every scene.

5876
04:33:26,620 --> 04:33:27,740
Now head for the goal.

5877
04:33:28,200 --> 04:33:31,000
You can check its location...

5878
04:33:31,000 --> 04:33:31,240
Good.

5879
04:33:31,480 --> 04:33:32,560
You erased a marking.

5880
04:33:32,940 --> 04:33:34,160
Looks like there's more of them.

5881
04:33:34,420 --> 04:33:38,140
You might be able to erase the markings, but the memories will never disappear.

5882
04:33:38,680 --> 04:33:39,640
Marker placed.

5883
04:33:39,760 --> 04:33:40,920
Does that mean...

5884
04:33:42,020 --> 04:33:42,900
That's so deep.

5885
04:33:57,510 --> 04:33:58,130
Where at?

5886
04:33:59,890 --> 04:34:01,270
Where are you?

5887
04:34:03,590 --> 04:34:04,410
I'll find it.

5888
04:34:04,490 --> 04:34:05,070
Don't tell me.

5889
04:34:05,750 --> 04:34:06,490
I'll find it.

5890
04:34:06,530 --> 04:34:07,110
Don't tell me.

5891
04:34:08,150 --> 04:34:08,810
I'll find it.

5892
04:34:08,830 --> 04:34:09,210
Don't tell me.

5893
04:34:09,270 --> 04:34:10,010
Don't tell me.

5894
04:34:10,110 --> 04:34:10,550
Don't tell me.

5895
04:34:10,610 --> 04:34:11,010
I'll find it.

5896
04:34:11,070 --> 04:34:11,550
Don't tell me.

5897
04:34:12,710 --> 04:34:13,710
I found it.

5898
04:34:13,750 --> 04:34:14,250
Don't tell me.

5899
04:34:15,070 --> 04:34:15,730
Snake eater.

5900
04:34:18,310 --> 04:34:18,730
Wow.

5901
04:34:19,390 --> 04:34:20,310
Oh, I should've...

5902
04:34:20,310 --> 04:34:21,730
I should've called him first.

5903
04:34:29,840 --> 04:34:31,480
Was there a logo here?

5904
04:34:31,680 --> 04:34:33,000
I did not see it though.

5905
04:34:35,360 --> 04:34:37,340
I didn't see a logo here.

5906
04:34:38,100 --> 04:34:39,400
Or was it?

5907
04:34:42,060 --> 04:34:44,160
On top of Ghost Babble Shack.

5908
04:34:44,260 --> 04:34:44,720
There's one there?

5909
04:34:48,440 --> 04:34:51,240
Can I ask if anybody knows how many there are?

5910
04:34:51,460 --> 04:34:53,080
Or if anybody cares to Google for me?

5911
04:34:53,920 --> 04:34:55,180
How many are there?

5912
04:34:55,440 --> 04:34:56,460
So that I can...

5913
04:35:01,860 --> 04:35:03,160
So I can be prepared.

5914
04:35:03,420 --> 04:35:04,200
Oh, this guy's still asleep.

5915
04:35:04,380 --> 04:35:04,540
Awesome.

5916
04:35:07,420 --> 04:35:08,560
Five for five games.

5917
04:35:08,780 --> 04:35:09,480
Okay, that's what I thought.

5918
04:35:09,780 --> 04:35:10,200
There might be.

5919
04:35:11,460 --> 04:35:11,900
Seven?

5920
04:35:12,280 --> 04:35:12,620
Wait.

5921
04:35:13,120 --> 04:35:14,360
Like five that I erase?

5922
04:35:16,460 --> 04:35:17,740
Ka's impression of the boss.

5923
04:35:17,980 --> 04:35:18,480
Look it up later.

5924
04:35:19,100 --> 04:35:20,160
Yeah, I have to.

5925
04:35:21,080 --> 04:35:22,220
I want to hear it.

5926
04:35:24,020 --> 04:35:26,500
I'm running, running, running, running, running, running.

5927
04:35:26,720 --> 04:35:27,980
Oh, that's the one that was over here.

5928
04:35:28,080 --> 04:35:28,320
That's right.

5929
04:35:28,780 --> 04:35:29,660
It was a touch.

5930
04:35:39,820 --> 04:35:40,800
One on top.

5931
04:35:40,960 --> 04:35:41,900
Oh, I see!

5932
04:35:42,200 --> 04:35:43,720
Wait, is that... That's V?

5933
04:35:48,560 --> 04:35:50,080
Haha, ground zeroes.

5934
04:35:54,420 --> 04:35:56,120
What do these get me, actually?

5935
04:35:56,480 --> 04:35:57,820
I don't even know what I'm doing.

5936
04:35:59,120 --> 04:36:00,660
I wish I had the boss's stamina.

5937
04:36:00,820 --> 04:36:01,080
I know, right?

5938
04:36:01,240 --> 04:36:02,000
Oh, call first!

5939
04:36:02,960 --> 04:36:03,580
Sorry, guys.

5940
04:36:03,680 --> 04:36:04,440
I get so...

5941
04:36:06,020 --> 04:36:07,160
I get so into it.

5942
04:36:07,340 --> 04:36:07,780
I'm sorry.

5943
04:36:08,920 --> 04:36:10,000
I forgot to ask.

5944
04:36:10,020 --> 04:36:10,380
I know.

5945
04:36:14,540 --> 04:36:15,580
I forgot.

5946
04:36:15,900 --> 04:36:16,380
I forgot.

5947
04:36:17,400 --> 04:36:17,920
What?

5948
04:36:18,020 --> 04:36:19,500
There are magazines in here the whole time.

5949
04:36:20,620 --> 04:36:21,140
Funny.

5950
04:36:21,840 --> 04:36:21,960
Oops.

5951
04:36:22,860 --> 04:36:23,240
Uh-oh.

5952
04:36:23,480 --> 04:36:25,840
I only have six rounds left.

5953
04:36:32,070 --> 04:36:33,610
I'll have to go lethal soon.

5954
04:36:35,290 --> 04:36:36,830
I'll have to go lethal soon.

5955
04:36:39,670 --> 04:36:41,830
They stay asleep forever in this game.

5956
04:36:42,130 --> 04:36:42,630
It's kind of crazy.

5957
04:36:43,330 --> 04:36:43,930
Oh, see?

5958
04:36:43,970 --> 04:36:44,690
He's already yawning.

5959
04:36:46,030 --> 04:36:47,930
I think they're just not getting enough sleep.

5960
04:36:48,530 --> 04:36:50,370
I think they're, like, overworked.

5961
04:36:52,090 --> 04:36:53,550
Go back to where Johnny is.

5962
04:36:53,790 --> 04:36:54,530
Wait, why?

5963
04:36:59,400 --> 04:37:00,920
Oh, I didn't even notice this guy.

5964
04:37:01,660 --> 04:37:03,000
I think I killed him before.

5965
04:37:07,380 --> 04:37:08,300
Overworked, underpaid.

5966
04:37:10,460 --> 04:37:11,180
Yeah, see?

5967
04:37:11,260 --> 04:37:12,300
These guys are still asleep.

5968
04:37:12,580 --> 04:37:14,400
Like, they stay asleep a long time.

5969
04:37:14,400 --> 04:37:15,920
Because it's like, you know...

5970
04:37:17,640 --> 04:37:18,240
Oh, sorry.

5971
04:37:18,360 --> 04:37:19,000
I pressed one thing.

5972
04:37:24,830 --> 04:37:25,210
Goal.

5973
04:37:25,370 --> 04:37:26,070
Okay, we know that.

5974
04:37:26,170 --> 04:37:27,050
We know that, obviously.

5975
04:37:48,550 --> 04:37:49,450
Where's the rest of them?

5976
04:37:52,470 --> 04:37:52,850
No!

5977
04:37:53,430 --> 04:37:54,390
That's not what I want!

5978
04:37:55,270 --> 04:37:55,850
Spit it out!

5979
04:37:58,590 --> 04:37:58,970
Useless!

5980
04:38:03,790 --> 04:38:04,250
Useless!

5981
04:38:07,230 --> 04:38:08,110
Oh, okay.

5982
04:38:09,770 --> 04:38:11,030
Does it strike anybody else?

5983
04:38:11,210 --> 04:38:13,770
Odd that nobody is freaked out about having a dart stuck in their body?

5984
04:38:15,610 --> 04:38:17,550
Nah, it's probably, like...

5985
04:38:18,810 --> 04:38:19,270
Normal.

5986
04:38:19,670 --> 04:38:20,550
It's like hazing.

5987
04:38:20,850 --> 04:38:21,990
Everybody gets darted.

5988
04:38:22,450 --> 04:38:23,450
All the time.

5989
04:38:26,430 --> 04:38:27,410
Over by Johnny.

5990
04:38:27,610 --> 04:38:29,950
Besides the mobile logo, there's a second on the metal roof.

5991
04:38:29,950 --> 04:38:30,930
Oh, thank you!

5992
04:38:32,450 --> 04:38:33,450
Back we go!

5993
04:38:34,670 --> 04:38:35,830
Back we go!

5994
04:38:36,190 --> 04:38:36,550
Oh, oh.

5995
04:38:36,710 --> 04:38:37,210
It's a bug.

5996
04:38:37,870 --> 04:38:38,610
Okay, Buzz.

5997
04:38:40,350 --> 04:38:42,290
Buzz has got to do his little shimmy first.

5998
04:38:44,510 --> 04:38:47,210
Yeah, we don't know what types of bugs there are here either.

5999
04:38:47,830 --> 04:38:48,490
You know?

6000
04:38:48,670 --> 04:38:52,470
It could be some crazy dart bugs.

6001
04:38:55,410 --> 04:38:57,610
So, I've done all of them now.

6002
04:38:58,230 --> 04:38:59,770
So, on top of this...

6003
04:39:00,970 --> 04:39:02,050
Can I even get up here?

6004
04:39:04,110 --> 04:39:05,070
How do I get...

6005
04:39:05,070 --> 04:39:06,490
Oh, do I have to go on top of...

6006
04:39:06,490 --> 04:39:06,710
Ew!

6007
04:39:07,230 --> 04:39:07,810
No, no!

6008
04:39:08,610 --> 04:39:09,010
Oh!

6009
04:39:10,890 --> 04:39:12,130
Can I get on top...

6010
04:39:12,130 --> 04:39:12,830
Oh, please.

6011
04:39:13,010 --> 04:39:13,430
I'm sorry.

6012
04:39:13,590 --> 04:39:13,870
Oh, God.

6013
04:39:15,190 --> 04:39:15,890
Oh, here we go.

6014
04:39:17,310 --> 04:39:18,210
Yeah, clearly.

6015
04:39:26,640 --> 04:39:27,340
Did I...

6016
04:39:27,340 --> 04:39:28,160
Did I get one guy?

6017
04:39:31,740 --> 04:39:34,440
Did I get one guy just so you can listen to Johnny some more?

6018
04:39:35,480 --> 04:39:37,340
Oh, it's under it.

6019
04:39:37,620 --> 04:39:37,880
Oh.

6020
04:39:38,540 --> 04:39:38,700
Wait.

6021
04:39:39,140 --> 04:39:39,720
Oh,

6022
04:39:44,160 --> 04:39:46,040
it's original Metal Gear!

6023
04:39:50,160 --> 04:39:51,140
Oh, I forgot!

6024
04:39:53,680 --> 04:39:55,080
I'm sorry, guys.

6025
04:39:55,080 --> 04:39:55,900
I suck.

6026
04:39:56,140 --> 04:39:57,040
I'm sorry.

6027
04:39:59,160 --> 04:40:00,640
I get so excited.

6028
04:40:00,940 --> 04:40:02,000
I'm sorry.

6029
04:40:06,180 --> 04:40:07,860
Oh, she has amnesia.

6030
04:40:08,040 --> 04:40:09,320
She hates the codec.

6031
04:40:10,640 --> 04:40:11,780
I'm so sorry.

6032
04:40:12,060 --> 04:40:12,760
Oh, gosh.

6033
04:40:13,300 --> 04:40:14,200
Okay, um...

6034
04:40:20,100 --> 04:40:22,320
Can I have a hint where another one would be?

6035
04:40:24,160 --> 04:40:25,440
Knock on his door.

6036
04:40:25,680 --> 04:40:26,380
Can we?

6037
04:40:29,140 --> 04:40:30,340
Yeah, I think...

6038
04:40:30,340 --> 04:40:31,300
Four and Peace Walker?

6039
04:40:37,830 --> 04:40:38,310
Oh.

6040
04:40:38,810 --> 04:40:39,470
I didn't mean it.

6041
04:40:39,630 --> 04:40:40,670
Wait, how do I knock, actually?

6042
04:40:41,230 --> 04:40:41,730
Oh.

6043
04:40:43,810 --> 04:40:44,530
Please don't.

6044
04:40:44,610 --> 04:40:45,110
I don't want to...

6045
04:40:45,110 --> 04:40:45,870
I don't want to be here anymore.

6046
04:40:49,600 --> 04:40:51,600
All erasables are marked on the map.

6047
04:40:52,220 --> 04:40:52,720
But...

6048
04:40:52,720 --> 04:40:53,400
I checked.

6049
04:40:54,560 --> 04:40:55,460
I'll go look.

6050
04:40:55,640 --> 04:40:56,200
I'll go look.

6051
04:40:59,420 --> 04:40:59,920
Oh!

6052
04:41:00,080 --> 04:41:02,240
This guy only has two of these left!

6053
04:41:02,660 --> 04:41:03,160
Why?

6054
04:41:04,200 --> 04:41:05,380
Oh, interesting.

6055
04:41:08,560 --> 04:41:09,400
Interesting, interesting.

6056
04:41:10,500 --> 04:41:13,380
I like how Snake just climbs over barbed wire.

6057
04:41:14,660 --> 04:41:16,140
Not a care in the world.

6058
04:41:17,960 --> 04:41:19,360
Oh, I stepped on him.

6059
04:41:19,660 --> 04:41:20,160
I did?

6060
04:41:21,300 --> 04:41:25,420
I thought the ones here were like the...

6061
04:41:27,860 --> 04:41:29,200
The ones that I had gotten.

6062
04:41:30,740 --> 04:41:31,300
Oh!

6063
04:41:31,620 --> 04:41:32,400
I see it!

6064
04:41:33,740 --> 04:41:35,020
I almost did it.

6065
04:41:35,340 --> 04:41:35,440
Look.

6066
04:41:35,760 --> 04:41:36,840
Boss, head toward the objective.

6067
04:41:36,840 --> 04:41:37,640
I almost did it.

6068
04:41:38,920 --> 04:41:39,760
Metal Gear 2.

6069
04:41:40,220 --> 04:41:41,200
Solid Snake.

6070
04:41:42,760 --> 04:41:46,420
Snake was 16 by 32 pixels and eight colors.

6071
04:41:46,960 --> 04:41:49,240
Why is he so obsessed with pixel size?

6072
04:41:49,500 --> 04:41:50,460
Gosh, guys.

6073
04:41:51,100 --> 04:41:52,460
Not everything is about size.

6074
04:41:53,480 --> 04:41:57,100
When making decisions on the battlefield, there's no single right answer.

6075
04:41:57,340 --> 04:41:58,640
Just trust your own judgment.

6076
04:41:59,220 --> 04:41:59,660
Over and out.

6077
04:41:59,860 --> 04:42:00,420
As a gamer!

6078
04:42:00,740 --> 04:42:01,880
Trust your instincts as a gamer!

6079
04:42:02,640 --> 04:42:03,400
Metal Gear 2.

6080
04:42:03,840 --> 04:42:04,840
Solid Snake.

6081
04:42:06,120 --> 04:42:08,360
Snake was 16 by 32 pixels.

6082
04:42:09,480 --> 04:42:10,320
Nice work!

6083
04:42:10,880 --> 04:42:11,760
Okay, cool.

6084
04:42:12,060 --> 04:42:12,480
And then...

6085
04:42:13,100 --> 04:42:15,780
I could have sworn I thought these ones were like the...

6086
04:42:16,640 --> 04:42:17,100
Oops.

6087
04:42:17,500 --> 04:42:18,360
Uh, were like the...

6088
04:42:21,120 --> 04:42:24,600
Ghost babbles and the ones that I had seen and couldn't do.

6089
04:42:25,500 --> 04:42:26,440
So, thank you.

6090
04:42:28,500 --> 04:42:29,320
Can I not?

6091
04:42:29,820 --> 04:42:31,120
I can't erase it.

6092
04:42:32,520 --> 04:42:33,860
I thought you could.

6093
04:42:35,240 --> 04:42:36,420
Okay, over here.

6094
04:42:38,780 --> 04:42:39,620
On the roof?

6095
04:42:44,000 --> 04:42:44,680
Oh, wait!

6096
04:42:44,860 --> 04:42:45,780
Oh, I see it!

6097
04:42:46,180 --> 04:42:47,460
Wait, there's two of them!

6098
04:42:51,630 --> 04:42:52,670
Metal Gear...

6099
04:42:53,670 --> 04:42:54,190
Huh.

6100
04:42:54,370 --> 04:42:54,810
What's that?

6101
04:42:55,590 --> 04:42:56,270
What's that?

6102
04:42:56,570 --> 04:42:57,490
Metal Gear...

6103
04:42:57,490 --> 04:42:58,190
Huh?

6104
04:43:00,670 --> 04:43:02,250
Metal Gear Solid 4.

6105
04:43:02,690 --> 04:43:03,950
Guns of the Patriots.

6106
04:43:04,050 --> 04:43:06,250
How many pixels was Snake this time?

6107
04:43:06,410 --> 04:43:07,390
Or polygons, I guess.

6108
04:43:07,590 --> 04:43:09,890
Snake's model was 14,000 polygons.

6109
04:43:16,620 --> 04:43:16,740
Ha!

6110
04:43:16,740 --> 04:43:17,220
Ha!

6111
04:43:17,580 --> 04:43:18,000
Woo-ah!

6112
04:43:18,000 --> 04:43:18,140
Ah!

6113
04:43:26,440 --> 04:43:29,780
Wait, what do you mean?

6114
04:43:30,540 --> 04:43:31,840
Wait, how do you know?

6115
04:43:31,920 --> 04:43:32,120
Wait!

6116
04:43:33,400 --> 04:43:33,560
What?

6117
04:43:34,860 --> 04:43:35,020
Wait!

6118
04:43:35,740 --> 04:43:36,380
Liquid!

6119
04:43:37,740 --> 04:43:38,380
Liquid!

6120
04:43:46,350 --> 04:43:48,630
I like how that one's orange.

6121
04:43:48,630 --> 04:43:49,090
Why?

6122
04:43:53,370 --> 04:43:53,930
Wait...

6123
04:43:56,330 --> 04:43:57,850
What did it trigger, though?

6124
04:43:59,730 --> 04:44:00,630
Go loud?

6125
04:44:00,810 --> 04:44:01,530
Yeah, baby.

6126
04:44:06,440 --> 04:44:07,000
Maybe...

6127
04:44:07,000 --> 04:44:07,940
Check the eye droid?

6128
04:44:09,780 --> 04:44:12,480
Can I leave, or is there something else that I should...

6129
04:44:12,480 --> 04:44:14,040
Do?

6130
04:44:18,260 --> 04:44:19,860
Someone woke up!

6131
04:44:23,420 --> 04:44:24,280
You can leave?

6132
04:44:26,140 --> 04:44:28,620
Peace Walker left, but he said, um...

6133
04:44:30,040 --> 04:44:32,460
I like how there's so many magazines.

6134
04:44:32,980 --> 04:44:34,440
You said that was the last one.

6135
04:44:36,600 --> 04:44:37,880
Want a hint for Peace Walker?

6136
04:44:38,080 --> 04:44:38,680
Oh, yes, please.

6137
04:44:38,980 --> 04:44:39,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6138
04:44:39,840 --> 04:44:40,520
That would be great.

6139
04:44:45,520 --> 04:44:46,720
Check the orange lie.

6140
04:44:46,720 --> 04:44:47,260
Oh!

6141
04:44:47,820 --> 04:44:48,180
Oh!

6142
04:44:48,760 --> 04:44:49,120
Oh!

6143
04:44:49,380 --> 04:44:49,400
Oh, oh.

6144
04:44:49,440 --> 04:44:50,280
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6145
04:44:53,280 --> 04:44:54,180
Oh my god.

6146
04:44:54,300 --> 04:44:54,900
Oh my god, please.

6147
04:44:57,180 --> 04:44:58,520
I did not see this man.

6148
04:44:58,520 --> 04:45:00,080
I did not...

6149
04:45:00,080 --> 04:45:00,820
I did, sorry.

6150
04:45:01,860 --> 04:45:02,260
Sorry.

6151
04:45:08,730 --> 04:45:09,130
Wait!

6152
04:45:09,490 --> 04:45:10,450
How did he survive?

6153
04:45:16,500 --> 04:45:17,340
How did he survive?

6154
04:45:19,500 --> 04:45:19,900
Shit.

6155
04:45:21,220 --> 04:45:22,100
Oh, I can't get him.

6156
04:45:22,340 --> 04:45:22,940
Oh, I can't get him.

6157
04:45:23,080 --> 04:45:23,540
I can't get him.

6158
04:45:23,860 --> 04:45:24,240
I can't get him.

6159
04:45:24,400 --> 04:45:25,540
Oh, shit.

6160
04:45:25,900 --> 04:45:26,620
I'm so...

6161
04:45:27,300 --> 04:45:27,700
No!

6162
04:45:30,820 --> 04:45:32,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6163
04:45:37,670 --> 04:45:38,370
Just kill him.

6164
04:45:38,470 --> 04:45:38,950
Just kill him.

6165
04:45:56,130 --> 04:45:57,130
No, please.

6166
04:45:58,230 --> 04:45:59,070
I'm innocent.

6167
04:45:59,470 --> 04:46:01,470
I wasn't trying to kill anybody.

6168
04:46:04,050 --> 04:46:05,370
I wasn't.

6169
04:46:07,090 --> 04:46:09,650
I see the fox logo right there.

6170
04:46:09,850 --> 04:46:10,530
I see it.

6171
04:46:11,810 --> 04:46:13,090
Don't forget about me.

6172
04:46:20,680 --> 04:46:22,080
He'll forget about me.

6173
04:46:24,180 --> 04:46:25,860
That was a super good run, though.

6174
04:46:26,000 --> 04:46:26,400
I know!

6175
04:46:26,640 --> 04:46:27,800
We were so close!

6176
04:46:31,920 --> 04:46:34,140
He'll come up, and then I'll get his ass.

6177
04:46:37,930 --> 04:46:38,950
Where is he, actually?

6178
04:46:41,530 --> 04:46:42,430
Oh, here he comes.

6179
04:46:54,920 --> 04:46:55,400
Nice.

6180
04:47:00,380 --> 04:47:01,080
Stay down!

6181
04:47:02,380 --> 04:47:02,980
Ah!

6182
04:47:03,420 --> 04:47:05,200
Are you for real?

6183
04:47:12,860 --> 04:47:14,020
Get out of there.

6184
04:47:14,180 --> 04:47:15,000
You get out of here.

6185
04:47:15,640 --> 04:47:16,840
You get out of there.

6186
04:47:17,160 --> 04:47:18,520
Time to make a pile.

6187
04:47:20,740 --> 04:47:22,260
You get out of there.

6188
04:47:22,800 --> 04:47:23,260
You go.

6189
04:47:28,460 --> 04:47:30,340
This guy's snoring below me.

6190
04:47:35,730 --> 04:47:38,290
He almost came up here, and then didn't.

6191
04:47:38,430 --> 04:47:39,070
You're so slow.

6192
04:47:40,690 --> 04:47:41,510
Come on!

6193
04:47:41,710 --> 04:47:42,190
Do something!

6194
04:47:51,990 --> 04:47:52,510
Nice!

6195
04:47:58,440 --> 04:47:58,960
Okay.

6196
04:48:00,740 --> 04:48:02,720
Now I can do what I wanted to do.

6197
04:48:03,960 --> 04:48:04,480
Wait.

6198
04:48:07,120 --> 04:48:08,160
I hear him.

6199
04:48:08,460 --> 04:48:09,520
I don't know where he is!

6200
04:48:11,440 --> 04:48:12,620
I hear him!

6201
04:48:12,620 --> 04:48:14,000
But I don't know...

6202
04:48:14,000 --> 04:48:14,520
I hear you!

6203
04:48:17,420 --> 04:48:19,000
That guy sounded so close!

6204
04:48:27,530 --> 04:48:28,450
Maybe it was him.

6205
04:48:30,030 --> 04:48:30,490
Anyway.

6206
04:48:36,680 --> 04:48:37,200
Uh...

6207
04:48:37,200 --> 04:48:37,940
Uh...

6208
04:48:37,940 --> 04:48:38,040
Oh!

6209
04:48:38,300 --> 04:48:38,400
Ah!

6210
04:48:39,120 --> 04:48:40,080
The dance!

6211
04:48:40,560 --> 04:48:40,960
Well, I'll be.

6212
04:48:41,400 --> 04:48:43,080
Kojima Productions, LA.

6213
04:48:43,280 --> 04:48:43,880
LA?

6214
04:48:47,220 --> 04:48:48,520
Well, I'll be.

6215
04:48:51,260 --> 04:48:52,300
How quirky.

6216
04:48:52,900 --> 04:48:53,840
Oh, thanks.

6217
04:48:54,680 --> 04:48:55,380
Sorry.

6218
04:48:55,560 --> 04:48:55,960
Sorry.

6219
04:48:56,280 --> 04:48:57,300
My one casualty.

6220
04:48:58,170 --> 04:48:58,780
Maybe more.

6221
04:48:58,880 --> 04:48:59,320
I don't remember.

6222
04:49:04,830 --> 04:49:06,050
Is that it, then?

6223
04:49:08,850 --> 04:49:09,870
Am I done?

6224
04:49:10,950 --> 04:49:11,650
Oh, call?

6225
04:49:15,400 --> 04:49:17,000
The enemy's searching for you.

6226
04:49:17,200 --> 04:49:18,120
Stay out of sight.

6227
04:49:19,140 --> 04:49:19,980
Still got the...

6228
04:49:19,980 --> 04:49:20,140
Okay.

6229
04:49:20,320 --> 04:49:20,580
Yeah.

6230
04:49:21,420 --> 04:49:23,600
Where's the Peace Walker logo, everybody?

6231
04:49:23,600 --> 04:49:24,460
Please help.

6232
04:49:26,380 --> 04:49:27,560
Call the chopper.

6233
04:49:27,560 --> 04:49:28,780
Oh, look.

6234
04:49:28,860 --> 04:49:29,240
My bad one.

6235
04:49:30,020 --> 04:49:30,540
Uh...

6236
04:49:31,080 --> 04:49:32,280
I could call him here.

6237
04:49:33,720 --> 04:49:34,920
Wait, can I actually?

6238
04:49:36,140 --> 04:49:37,480
On the chopper?

6239
04:49:39,500 --> 04:49:40,020
No.

6240
04:49:45,480 --> 04:49:46,520
Danger low?

6241
04:49:46,700 --> 04:49:46,840
How?

6242
04:49:51,660 --> 04:49:52,720
How is this...

6243
04:49:54,840 --> 04:49:56,220
How can he land here?

6244
04:49:56,220 --> 04:49:57,540
Actually, I'm very confused.

6245
04:49:58,860 --> 04:50:00,320
How can he land here?

6246
04:50:07,310 --> 04:50:08,450
I'm working on it.

6247
04:50:10,230 --> 04:50:12,690
Okay, he doesn't care about Kojima Productions.

6248
04:50:12,790 --> 04:50:13,390
He's a hater.

6249
04:50:14,210 --> 04:50:15,670
He just lands there.

6250
04:50:15,990 --> 04:50:16,850
But how?

6251
04:50:17,250 --> 04:50:17,830
It's so...

6252
04:50:17,830 --> 04:50:19,450
There's not any space here at all.

6253
04:50:22,550 --> 04:50:23,170
Morpho!

6254
04:50:24,790 --> 04:50:25,410
Morpho!

6255
04:50:31,330 --> 04:50:32,570
It's on the chopper.

6256
04:50:32,730 --> 04:50:33,090
Got it.

6257
04:50:33,270 --> 04:50:34,670
Do I...

6258
04:50:34,670 --> 04:50:35,450
Board the chopper?

6259
04:50:35,650 --> 04:50:37,850
Or do I...

6260
04:50:37,850 --> 04:50:38,610
Um...

6261
04:50:42,920 --> 04:50:43,440
What?

6262
04:50:43,580 --> 04:50:44,620
This was supposed to be low!

6263
04:50:45,380 --> 04:50:46,040
This is Morpho.

6264
04:50:46,220 --> 04:50:47,420
On station at LC.

6265
04:50:47,760 --> 04:50:48,660
Do not board.

6266
04:50:48,920 --> 04:50:49,020
Okay.

6267
04:50:50,420 --> 04:50:51,200
Thank you.

6268
04:50:51,560 --> 04:50:52,180
Thanks guys.

6269
04:50:54,640 --> 04:50:55,340
Oh my god.

6270
04:50:56,860 --> 04:50:57,220
Uh...

6271
04:50:57,660 --> 04:50:58,020
Uh...

6272
04:50:58,020 --> 04:50:58,380
I'm looking.

6273
04:50:58,560 --> 04:50:58,740
I'm looking.

6274
04:50:58,800 --> 04:50:59,300
Oh, I see it!

6275
04:50:59,360 --> 04:50:59,620
I see it!

6276
04:51:04,610 --> 04:51:05,710
Wait, does that count?

6277
04:51:05,870 --> 04:51:06,070
Actually?

6278
04:51:08,430 --> 04:51:09,110
Nope.

6279
04:51:09,710 --> 04:51:10,390
Uh...

6280
04:51:10,390 --> 04:51:10,770
Other side?

6281
04:51:12,130 --> 04:51:12,810
Ah!

6282
04:51:12,910 --> 04:51:13,510
There it is!

6283
04:51:17,310 --> 04:51:18,390
Oh, he hates it!

6284
04:51:20,230 --> 04:51:20,910
Ah!

6285
04:51:21,030 --> 04:51:21,290
Nevermind.

6286
04:51:31,450 --> 04:51:33,810
I can't stand this man!

6287
04:51:37,590 --> 04:51:38,550
The markings...

6288
04:51:38,550 --> 04:51:40,030
That every one of them will always...

6289
04:51:50,520 --> 04:51:50,700
Ha ha!

6290
04:51:51,080 --> 04:51:51,500
Cute!

6291
04:51:57,010 --> 04:51:57,950
Target acquired!

6292
04:51:58,150 --> 04:51:58,630
In hot!

6293
04:52:00,770 --> 04:52:01,250
Um...

6294
04:52:01,250 --> 04:52:02,370
You can leave now, Morpho!

6295
04:52:07,500 --> 04:52:08,980
Might even be better for you, buddy.

6296
04:52:12,800 --> 04:52:13,760
Oh, what?!

6297
04:52:13,760 --> 04:52:14,760
How did that not hit?

6298
04:52:14,960 --> 04:52:15,540
This is Morpho.

6299
04:52:15,700 --> 04:52:16,860
On station at LC.

6300
04:52:18,600 --> 04:52:19,800
Death Stranding week.

6301
04:52:20,300 --> 04:52:22,080
Yeah, it was actually supposed to be...

6302
04:52:22,080 --> 04:52:23,380
CP, this is Delta IV.

6303
04:52:23,640 --> 04:52:24,360
Murder explosion.

6304
04:52:24,860 --> 04:52:25,280
Location is clear.

6305
04:52:25,280 --> 04:52:27,060
It was right behind you!

6306
04:52:29,100 --> 04:52:29,700
Oh!

6307
04:52:30,300 --> 04:52:30,900
Oops.

6308
04:52:31,660 --> 04:52:32,260
Oopsie.

6309
04:52:32,660 --> 04:52:34,100
I thought that was my other...

6310
04:52:34,100 --> 04:52:34,320
Oh!

6311
04:52:34,520 --> 04:52:34,780
Oops!

6312
04:52:35,100 --> 04:52:35,680
Oops!

6313
04:52:36,660 --> 04:52:38,600
I have two deaths on my hands.

6314
04:52:44,900 --> 04:52:46,880
I am not an innocent man.

6315
04:52:48,700 --> 04:52:49,740
I haven't...

6316
04:52:49,740 --> 04:52:50,360
Where?

6317
04:52:50,820 --> 04:52:51,420
Where?!

6318
04:52:51,420 --> 04:52:52,140
Where?!

6319
04:52:52,780 --> 04:52:53,680
Oh, shit.

6320
04:52:53,680 --> 04:52:54,300
In hot!

6321
04:52:54,620 --> 04:52:55,320
They had a kill,

6322
04:53:02,280 --> 04:53:02,640
Morpho.

6323
04:53:02,780 --> 04:53:03,800
No targets remaining.

6324
04:53:04,200 --> 04:53:06,320
Ending attack run and we'll stand by at LC.

6325
04:53:06,680 --> 04:53:06,940
Okay!

6326
04:53:07,700 --> 04:53:08,640
This is Morpho.

6327
04:53:08,780 --> 04:53:09,740
Have arrived at LC.

6328
04:53:10,080 --> 04:53:10,820
We'll stand by.

6329
04:53:11,100 --> 04:53:11,440
Bye!

6330
04:53:11,840 --> 04:53:12,200
Oh, look.

6331
04:53:12,200 --> 04:53:13,740
Those mice are Alaskan field mice.

6332
04:53:13,880 --> 04:53:15,000
But there are no mice.

6333
04:53:15,200 --> 04:53:15,220
No.

6334
04:53:15,780 --> 04:53:16,300
No, they're not.

6335
04:53:16,560 --> 04:53:17,960
Guys, your meds.

6336
04:53:18,860 --> 04:53:19,980
Are you feeling okay?

6337
04:53:22,340 --> 04:53:22,800
Yeah!

6338
04:53:24,080 --> 04:53:24,340
Phew.

6339
04:53:24,700 --> 04:53:26,000
At least you made it out in one piece.

6340
04:53:26,020 --> 04:53:26,520
I know.

6341
04:53:27,320 --> 04:53:30,300
Minus nine, nine, nine, nine for my time.

6342
04:53:34,180 --> 04:53:36,140
I was just like, I can do this quickly!

6343
04:53:37,440 --> 04:53:38,840
Nearly an hour later.

6344
04:53:48,190 --> 04:53:48,670
Ouch!

6345
04:53:55,770 --> 04:53:57,010
Not yet, Snake!

6346
04:53:57,630 --> 04:53:59,090
It's not over yet!

6347
04:54:01,010 --> 04:54:03,230
You really didn't count the Trank guy who fell.

6348
04:54:03,430 --> 04:54:03,570
Yeah!

6349
04:54:03,570 --> 04:54:05,150
Impressive work, Snake.

6350
04:54:05,510 --> 04:54:06,530
Mission complete.

6351
04:54:06,830 --> 04:54:08,610
Is not what I'm here to say.

6352
04:54:08,790 --> 04:54:08,890
Oh.

6353
04:54:09,590 --> 04:54:12,010
Believe it or not, the real mission starts here.

6354
04:54:12,250 --> 04:54:12,430
Oh!

6355
04:54:13,530 --> 04:54:13,850
Huh?

6356
04:54:14,030 --> 04:54:14,550
I'm scared!

6357
04:54:14,610 --> 04:54:16,110
This is not Master Miller!

6358
04:54:17,890 --> 04:54:19,730
Snake, you're too late.

6359
04:54:20,630 --> 04:54:21,750
It's me!

6360
04:54:22,190 --> 04:54:22,790
It's me!

6361
04:54:22,790 --> 04:54:23,570
Dear brother!

6362
04:54:24,870 --> 04:54:25,270
Woo!

6363
04:54:27,550 --> 04:54:28,150
Woo!

6364
04:54:28,570 --> 04:54:28,630
Woo!

6365
04:54:28,630 --> 04:54:31,370
I'm gonna ask you some questions about Metal Gear Solid 1.

6366
04:54:31,490 --> 04:54:31,750
Okay.

6367
04:54:32,050 --> 04:54:36,810
If you answer all of them correctly, then and only then, do you truly clear this mission.

6368
04:54:36,810 --> 04:54:37,450
I'm scared!

6369
04:54:37,750 --> 04:54:38,130
It's pressure!

6370
04:54:38,870 --> 04:54:41,030
I'll even throw in a special bonus.

6371
04:54:41,130 --> 04:54:41,590
Woo!

6372
04:54:43,930 --> 04:54:44,190
Huh?

6373
04:54:45,690 --> 04:54:45,910
Huh?

6374
04:54:45,910 --> 04:54:49,650
You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?

6375
04:54:49,910 --> 04:54:50,210
Huh?

6376
04:54:50,510 --> 04:54:54,010
But you'll have to solve the rest of this riddle yourself.

6377
04:54:55,450 --> 04:54:57,530
These impressions are killing me.

6378
04:55:01,090 --> 04:55:01,690
Wow!

6379
04:55:02,250 --> 04:55:02,370
Woo!

6380
04:55:03,050 --> 04:55:04,770
The difficulty level is normal.

6381
04:55:04,910 --> 04:55:05,870
Normal, okay.

6382
04:55:06,450 --> 04:55:09,190
Get just one question wrong, and the mission is over.

6383
04:55:09,410 --> 04:55:09,650
Okay.

6384
04:55:10,050 --> 04:55:12,270
There are no continues, my friend.

6385
04:55:12,810 --> 04:55:16,110
Don't even think about looking up the answers online.

6386
04:55:16,250 --> 04:55:17,130
Or I know.

6387
04:55:17,510 --> 04:55:17,830
Oh!

6388
04:55:18,590 --> 04:55:18,870
Ready?

6389
04:55:19,210 --> 04:55:19,730
Okay.

6390
04:55:20,690 --> 04:55:22,090
Take the Metal Gear Solid quiz?

6391
04:55:22,270 --> 04:55:22,530
Yes.

6392
04:55:23,430 --> 04:55:24,090
Here we go.

6393
04:55:24,370 --> 04:55:24,970
Snake!

6394
04:55:26,310 --> 04:55:27,510
These are so funny.

6395
04:55:27,510 --> 04:55:28,230
Funny!

6396
04:55:29,430 --> 04:55:29,490
Oh!

6397
04:55:29,830 --> 04:55:33,510
MGS1 featured Solid Snake infiltrating which island?

6398
04:55:34,610 --> 04:55:35,410
Wow!

6399
04:55:35,530 --> 04:55:36,650
There's so many questions!

6400
04:55:37,030 --> 04:55:37,870
Oh my gosh!

6401
04:55:38,230 --> 04:55:38,290
Okay.

6402
04:55:38,410 --> 04:55:38,990
Shadow Moses.

6403
04:55:39,390 --> 04:55:40,010
Correct.

6404
04:55:40,190 --> 04:55:40,690
Tweedoo!

6405
04:55:41,330 --> 04:55:41,670
Hawaii.

6406
04:55:43,370 --> 04:55:46,390
The remote-controlled missile was known by which nickname?

6407
04:55:47,170 --> 04:55:47,770
Nikita!

6408
04:55:48,250 --> 04:55:49,050
Natasha!

6409
04:55:49,990 --> 04:55:50,390
Katherine!

6410
04:55:51,210 --> 04:55:51,950
Nikita!

6411
04:55:52,770 --> 04:55:53,370
Correct.

6412
04:55:53,790 --> 04:55:54,070
Correct.

6413
04:55:54,570 --> 04:55:54,950
Question?

6414
04:55:56,570 --> 04:56:00,210
Who did you need to call on the codec in order to save your progress?

6415
04:56:00,570 --> 04:56:00,730
Oh!

6416
04:56:02,910 --> 04:56:06,070
This is a trick question if you were thinking of two, right?

6417
04:56:06,470 --> 04:56:07,050
Meilin!

6418
04:56:07,910 --> 04:56:08,410
Correct.

6419
04:56:08,850 --> 04:56:09,270
Correct.

6420
04:56:09,670 --> 04:56:10,450
You're pretty good.

6421
04:56:11,670 --> 04:56:11,990
Question?

6422
04:56:12,910 --> 04:56:13,490
Oh no!

6423
04:56:13,710 --> 04:56:14,890
I'm becoming stupid!

6424
04:56:15,510 --> 04:56:21,190
The Next Generation Special Forces who took part in the uprising with Foxhound were given what treatment?

6425
04:56:24,410 --> 04:56:26,490
They might as well have been lobotomies!

6426
04:56:30,330 --> 04:56:31,250
That's so good!

6427
04:56:31,710 --> 04:56:32,030
Correct.

6428
04:56:33,350 --> 04:56:33,670
Question?

6429
04:56:35,210 --> 04:56:35,730
Um, wait.

6430
04:56:36,050 --> 04:56:37,170
Actually, I have a sound...

6431
04:56:37,170 --> 04:56:37,570
Hold on, wait.

6432
04:56:37,690 --> 04:56:39,570
I have a sound on my soundboard that sounds like this too.

6433
04:56:40,270 --> 04:56:41,090
Nope, not that one.

6434
04:56:41,690 --> 04:56:42,990
Oh my god, it's so loud!

6435
04:56:43,290 --> 04:56:43,750
Wait, hold on.

6436
04:56:44,390 --> 04:56:45,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one!

6437
04:56:46,010 --> 04:56:46,390
Haha!

6438
04:56:48,850 --> 04:56:49,310
Badum!

6439
04:56:49,870 --> 04:56:53,710
On which floor of the nuclear warhead storage building was Otacon's lab located?

6440
04:56:54,450 --> 04:56:56,210
Bottom of a trap pit!

6441
04:57:04,040 --> 04:57:05,120
Third floor?

6442
04:57:05,600 --> 04:57:06,940
Or second floor?

6443
04:57:07,240 --> 04:57:08,540
Oh god, it's a...

6444
04:57:09,280 --> 04:57:10,460
Second floor basement?

6445
04:57:12,500 --> 04:57:13,740
I can't remember!

6446
04:57:13,860 --> 04:57:14,420
I can't remember!

6447
04:57:14,680 --> 04:57:14,980
I can't remember numbers!

6448
04:57:17,420 --> 04:57:19,660
I don't even think about asking chat.

6449
04:57:20,600 --> 04:57:21,680
It's a second floor basement.

6450
04:57:23,020 --> 04:57:23,940
Don't look it up.

6451
04:57:24,040 --> 04:57:24,380
I'm not.

6452
04:57:24,680 --> 04:57:26,040
I'm using you guys for help.

6453
04:57:26,760 --> 04:57:27,780
Third was the back...

6454
04:57:27,780 --> 04:57:27,960
Gas room.

6455
04:57:28,100 --> 04:57:29,620
I always mix them up which was which.

6456
04:57:33,340 --> 04:57:34,220
Correct.

6457
04:57:35,040 --> 04:57:35,920
Question.

6458
04:57:37,040 --> 04:57:39,760
What was Cyborg Ninja's true identity?

6459
04:57:42,120 --> 04:57:43,540
Wait, this is awesome!

6460
04:57:43,940 --> 04:57:45,980
This is also a trick question!

6461
04:57:46,500 --> 04:57:47,520
That's messed up.

6462
04:57:47,720 --> 04:57:49,440
The fact that it's Frank Hunter.

6463
04:57:49,940 --> 04:57:50,520
No way!

6464
04:57:54,040 --> 04:57:55,960
That's so messed up!

6465
04:57:57,220 --> 04:57:57,660
Correct.

6466
04:57:58,800 --> 04:57:59,180
Question.

6467
04:58:00,780 --> 04:58:04,960
Before being called back into action for the mission, Snake lived in Alaska as a what?

6468
04:58:05,100 --> 04:58:06,100
A musher!

6469
04:58:06,700 --> 04:58:08,380
An ear pull competitor?

6470
04:58:11,760 --> 04:58:12,280
Okay.

6471
04:58:15,300 --> 04:58:16,360
What does that even mean?

6472
04:58:16,360 --> 04:58:16,840
I'm glad you remember.

6473
04:58:18,360 --> 04:58:19,120
Of course!

6474
04:58:19,240 --> 04:58:19,840
That's my favorite!

6475
04:58:20,080 --> 04:58:21,800
That's like actually one of my favorite things.

6476
04:58:24,040 --> 04:58:24,560
Wait.

6477
04:58:24,840 --> 04:58:28,320
What was the maximum load of the elevator in communications tower B?

6478
04:58:29,780 --> 04:58:31,220
300 kilograms?

6479
04:58:33,720 --> 04:58:35,620
30 ravens?

6480
04:58:38,820 --> 04:58:42,780
Does 30 ravens equate to 5 or 4 people?

6481
04:58:43,420 --> 04:58:44,720
It's 4 people.

6482
04:58:44,920 --> 04:58:47,380
Is that about 30 ravens?

6483
04:58:47,620 --> 04:58:48,360
It's so funny.

6484
04:58:48,800 --> 04:58:50,420
300 kilograms, right?

6485
04:58:50,420 --> 04:58:51,400
Yeah.

6486
04:58:51,800 --> 04:58:55,200
650 pounds would be like 4 people.

6487
04:58:56,260 --> 04:58:56,680
Average.

6488
04:58:57,820 --> 04:59:00,400
Raven mentions ear pulling as a warrior game.

6489
04:59:00,520 --> 04:59:01,340
Oh, that's right!

6490
04:59:02,920 --> 04:59:03,720
Correct.

6491
04:59:03,720 --> 04:59:04,180
Okay.

6492
04:59:04,620 --> 04:59:07,580
If you think you'll get the answer out of me, forget it.

6493
04:59:08,160 --> 04:59:10,520
There isn't even any sodium pentothal here.

6494
04:59:11,700 --> 04:59:12,260
Question.

6495
04:59:12,520 --> 04:59:16,500
These like people in the background that are giggling and stuff.

6496
04:59:19,080 --> 04:59:22,340
Which type of storage media did the arms tech president give Snake?

6497
04:59:23,620 --> 04:59:24,700
Optical disc.

6498
04:59:25,100 --> 04:59:25,920
Punch card.

6499
04:59:26,280 --> 04:59:27,580
It's the optical disc, right?

6500
04:59:27,880 --> 04:59:27,960
Yeah.

6501
04:59:28,960 --> 04:59:29,260
Correct.

6502
04:59:30,380 --> 04:59:31,700
You got quite a memory.

6503
04:59:31,920 --> 04:59:32,320
Thank you.

6504
04:59:32,980 --> 04:59:34,700
Now for the final question.

6505
04:59:35,420 --> 04:59:36,720
Let's finish this.

6506
04:59:37,840 --> 04:59:38,900
Have at you, Snake.

6507
04:59:40,020 --> 04:59:40,580
Question.

6508
04:59:40,840 --> 04:59:41,920
Punch cards is so funny.

6509
04:59:42,500 --> 04:59:44,800
What is the title of the ending theme?

6510
04:59:46,320 --> 04:59:47,180
Oh, wow.

6511
04:59:47,480 --> 04:59:50,120
If you didn't know, this is kind of messed up though.

6512
04:59:50,300 --> 04:59:51,280
Because it's all of them.

6513
04:59:52,040 --> 04:59:53,920
The best is yet to come.

6514
04:59:54,060 --> 04:59:57,200
I wonder though, what the hard quiz is like now.

6515
05:00:01,800 --> 05:00:02,280
Yay!

6516
05:00:04,560 --> 05:00:07,720
The only one I really needed help with was the basement one.

6517
05:00:08,360 --> 05:00:08,940
Thanks, guys.

6518
05:00:09,240 --> 05:00:11,300
I'll give you that special bonus I promise later.

6519
05:00:11,920 --> 05:00:13,120
Something to look forward to.

6520
05:00:13,920 --> 05:00:15,260
I enjoyed it myself.

6521
05:00:15,520 --> 05:00:16,320
Master Miller.

6522
05:00:16,600 --> 05:00:16,880
Thank you.

6523
05:00:22,930 --> 05:00:23,490
Engine!

6524
05:00:26,610 --> 05:00:27,170
Hound!

6525
05:00:27,490 --> 05:00:28,050
Alive!

6526
05:00:43,220 --> 05:00:43,780
Yay!

6527
05:00:48,440 --> 05:00:50,120
This is so goofy.

6528
05:00:51,020 --> 05:00:54,820
Just what I'd expect from a man with the same coat as the boss.

6529
05:01:02,320 --> 05:01:02,880
Yay!

6530
05:01:05,460 --> 05:01:06,480
What did I get?

6531
05:01:09,440 --> 05:01:10,000
Oh!

6532
05:01:18,410 --> 05:01:18,890
Just loaded?

6533
05:01:19,770 --> 05:01:20,330
Yay!

6534
05:01:32,280 --> 05:01:33,780
Now, I have a question.

6535
05:01:34,100 --> 05:01:35,500
If I do this...

6536
05:01:35,500 --> 05:01:38,780
If I do this mission again, will they be the Shadow Moses?

6537
05:01:40,340 --> 05:01:41,900
Will they be the Shadow Moses?

6538
05:01:43,160 --> 05:01:43,560
Uh...

6539
05:01:43,560 --> 05:01:44,700
The soldiers as well.

6540
05:01:45,700 --> 05:01:47,000
Or is it only in hard mode?

6541
05:01:49,940 --> 05:01:51,020
After hard mode!

6542
05:01:51,140 --> 05:01:52,220
Oh, I have to do hard mode too.

6543
05:01:55,850 --> 05:01:56,990
If you beat it on hard.

6544
05:01:57,710 --> 05:01:57,970
Ah!

6545
05:01:58,250 --> 05:01:58,450
Ah!

6546
05:01:58,690 --> 05:01:58,770
Ah!

6547
05:01:58,770 --> 05:01:58,910
Ah!

6548
05:01:59,030 --> 05:01:59,390
Ah!

6549
05:01:59,390 --> 05:01:59,910
I see, I see.

6550
05:02:00,210 --> 05:02:01,390
I see, I see, I see.

6551
05:02:01,850 --> 05:02:03,550
If you press right...

6552
05:02:03,550 --> 05:02:04,030
Oh!

6553
05:02:04,690 --> 05:02:05,090
This...

6554
05:02:05,090 --> 05:02:06,090
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

6555
05:02:06,250 --> 05:02:06,830
Wait a second.

6556
05:02:07,190 --> 05:02:08,670
Okay, I'm not gonna actually do the mission.

6557
05:02:10,090 --> 05:02:11,610
I said that last time too.

6558
05:02:11,610 --> 05:02:13,770
But I actually, I do wanna see you though.

6559
05:02:15,170 --> 05:02:16,330
I wanna see you though.

6560
05:02:17,230 --> 05:02:19,250
You've proven your MGS nerdiness supremacy.

6561
05:02:19,590 --> 05:02:21,190
I must say boss, you're pretty good.

6562
05:02:21,750 --> 05:02:22,630
Thank you.

6563
05:02:24,670 --> 05:02:26,790
I felt like most of them were too easy though, no?

6564
05:02:27,330 --> 05:02:30,130
I still think the Frank Hunter thing is kinda messed up.

6565
05:02:30,730 --> 05:02:32,370
That's actually pretty messed up.

6566
05:02:35,470 --> 05:02:36,650
Oh my gosh, it's...

6567
05:02:36,650 --> 05:02:37,350
Snowing!

6568
05:02:43,890 --> 05:02:45,470
There's a different quiz on hard mode.

6569
05:02:45,570 --> 05:02:46,890
Oh, is there a different quiz on hard mode?

6570
05:02:46,990 --> 05:02:48,330
There is, there is.

6571
05:02:48,930 --> 05:02:50,190
Actually, can we look it up?

6572
05:02:51,190 --> 05:02:52,430
I wanna see what it is.

6573
05:02:55,870 --> 05:02:57,290
Hard quiz is actually hard?

6574
05:02:57,470 --> 05:02:58,070
Let's try it.

6575
05:02:58,210 --> 05:02:59,730
Well, I'm not gonna do it.

6576
05:02:59,890 --> 05:03:01,150
But, you know, I'm gonna try it.

6577
05:03:01,370 --> 05:03:02,170
Kept you waiting, huh?

6578
05:03:02,590 --> 05:03:03,210
Okay, that's...

6579
05:03:03,210 --> 05:03:03,310
No.

6580
05:03:03,870 --> 05:03:04,710
This is so wrong.

6581
05:03:07,050 --> 05:03:08,230
This is so wrong.

6582
05:03:08,470 --> 05:03:08,730
No!

6583
05:03:09,430 --> 05:03:09,870
No!

6584
05:03:10,390 --> 05:03:11,530
No, I hate it!

6585
05:03:12,910 --> 05:03:13,970
I hate it!

6586
05:03:17,190 --> 05:03:20,050
He never got cause to meow at you in his date.

6587
05:03:21,070 --> 05:03:21,790
That's true.

6588
05:03:23,210 --> 05:03:25,390
But also, no, I'm not redoing missions.

6589
05:03:25,590 --> 05:03:26,270
I'm just...

6590
05:03:28,050 --> 05:03:29,130
This is so great!

6591
05:03:29,470 --> 05:03:31,530
I just wanna show you guys the, uh...

6592
05:03:31,530 --> 05:03:31,970
The soldiers.

6593
05:03:37,830 --> 05:03:38,850
Look, look, look, look, look!

6594
05:03:45,090 --> 05:03:46,650
He's so cute!

6595
05:03:48,150 --> 05:03:49,310
I love...

6596
05:03:49,310 --> 05:03:50,830
I love...

6597
05:03:50,830 --> 05:03:51,770
I love the gnome soldiers!

6598
05:03:54,370 --> 05:03:55,830
And it's snowing!

6599
05:03:55,930 --> 05:03:57,030
This is so awesome!

6600
05:03:57,470 --> 05:03:58,350
Look, look, look, look, look!

6601
05:03:58,550 --> 05:04:03,490
Look, look, look!

6602
05:04:03,610 --> 05:04:05,390
Oh my god, they're so cute!

6603
05:04:06,190 --> 05:04:08,890
As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.

6604
05:04:09,270 --> 05:04:10,340
Weapons and equipment...

6605
05:04:11,900 --> 05:04:13,520
This is a one-man infiltration mission.

6606
05:04:13,720 --> 05:04:14,420
This is a one-man infiltration mission.

6607
05:04:15,820 --> 05:04:16,740
Okay, okay, okay.

6608
05:04:16,860 --> 05:04:17,120
Let me...

6609
05:04:17,120 --> 05:04:17,640
Let me leave.

6610
05:04:19,000 --> 05:04:19,360
Huh?

6611
05:04:19,900 --> 05:04:20,720
Don't worry about it.

6612
05:04:20,940 --> 05:04:21,720
Don't worry about it, buddy.

6613
05:04:23,120 --> 05:04:23,840
Oh wait...

6614
05:04:23,840 --> 05:04:25,180
What can we put on?

6615
05:04:47,670 --> 05:04:49,470
It's kinda owned, actually.

6616
05:04:49,910 --> 05:04:50,830
I'm not gonna lie.

6617
05:04:56,880 --> 05:04:57,600
Yeah!

6618
05:04:58,420 --> 05:04:59,800
Oh god, I'm gonna die!

6619
05:05:00,000 --> 05:05:00,720
I'm gonna die!

6620
05:05:02,860 --> 05:05:03,580
Run!

6621
05:05:20,750 --> 05:05:21,970
I'm just running!

6622
05:05:22,890 --> 05:05:24,030
I'm just running!

6623
05:05:27,030 --> 05:05:29,370
I'm being alive, actually!

6624
05:05:33,460 --> 05:05:34,960
Oh my god!

6625
05:05:38,280 --> 05:05:39,460
Come here!

6626
05:05:46,790 --> 05:05:47,270
No!

6627
05:05:47,710 --> 05:05:52,090
Do do do do do!

6628
05:05:52,610 --> 05:05:53,670
Do do do do!

6629
05:05:54,150 --> 05:05:55,530
Do do do do do!

6630
05:05:55,530 --> 05:05:55,810
Do do do2!

6631
05:05:57,110 --> 05:06:00,470
Give her that!

6632
05:06:16,170 --> 05:06:17,070
That was good.

6633
05:06:17,230 --> 05:06:18,370
Return to the sea!

6634
05:06:23,560 --> 05:06:25,620
Wow, perfect way to end it.

6635
05:06:31,380 --> 05:06:32,380
I'll be honest.

6636
05:06:37,290 --> 05:06:39,010
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

6637
05:06:39,030 --> 05:06:40,550
I did not mean to put on this song.

6638
05:06:41,370 --> 05:06:42,010
There we go.

6639
05:06:45,630 --> 05:06:48,850
I don't know when I will start five.

6640
05:06:50,210 --> 05:06:52,290
Might be once I get back from Japan.

6641
05:06:53,590 --> 05:06:56,130
So... In a whole month, probably.

6642
05:06:59,330 --> 05:07:00,290
But, yeah.

6643
05:07:02,910 --> 05:07:05,650
Probably sometime before I start it.

6644
05:07:09,530 --> 05:07:10,990
What about Death Stranding?

6645
05:07:11,070 --> 05:07:11,730
Oh, I was saying that!

6646
05:07:12,270 --> 05:07:15,250
Actually, this month I wanted to do the Death Stranding week.

6647
05:07:15,250 --> 05:07:19,970
But, might have to wait until next month.

6648
05:07:20,250 --> 05:07:25,830
I had some other stuff that was, like, coming up and other obligations and things and things.

6649
05:07:26,030 --> 05:07:33,170
So... But I don't go to Japan until... Until... End of May.

6650
05:07:33,670 --> 05:07:34,810
So... We have lots of time.

6651
05:07:36,970 --> 05:07:39,290
Guys would be really happy to know you're going to Japan.

6652
05:07:39,570 --> 05:07:40,170
I know!

6653
05:07:41,350 --> 05:07:42,590
We'll wait for you guys.

6654
05:07:42,770 --> 05:07:43,230
Thank you!

6655
05:07:44,170 --> 05:07:44,650
Yeah.

6656
05:07:47,910 --> 05:07:52,510
But I have to... Finish Death Stranding as quickly as I can because... When does that come out?

6657
05:07:52,650 --> 05:07:53,030
Hold on, let me check.

6658
05:07:54,670 --> 05:07:55,410
Let's see.

6659
05:07:56,710 --> 05:07:57,750
Lambda, thank you!

6660
05:07:58,030 --> 05:07:58,990
Death Stranding!

6661
05:07:59,190 --> 05:07:59,510
Rawr!

6662
05:08:00,970 --> 05:08:01,330
Thank you!

6663
05:08:01,430 --> 05:08:04,770
Oh my gosh, Lambda, you... Your wallet, please!

6664
05:08:05,130 --> 05:08:06,510
Your wallet, please!

6665
05:08:07,310 --> 05:08:08,650
Death Stranding...

6666
05:08:15,270 --> 05:08:16,830
This is so nostalgic.

6667
05:08:17,710 --> 05:08:18,110
Right?

6668
05:08:20,230 --> 05:08:21,670
This is so nostalgic.

6669
05:08:23,970 --> 05:08:25,330
I love this version so much.

6670
05:08:25,410 --> 05:08:26,570
Oh, so thank you for the brand!

6671
05:08:27,350 --> 05:08:27,830
Thank you for the brand!

6672
05:08:29,570 --> 05:08:30,710
Thank you so much!

6673
05:08:30,830 --> 05:08:31,490
Thank you, thank you!

6674
05:08:34,790 --> 05:08:38,570
I saw that someone uploaded a mint poster for the cardboard box!

6675
05:08:38,770 --> 05:08:39,590
No way!

6676
05:08:39,850 --> 05:08:40,090
Really?

6677
05:08:40,990 --> 05:08:44,290
We might have to do... I want to play 5 with a bunch of mods.

6678
05:08:44,450 --> 05:08:45,230
I'll be honest.

6679
05:08:45,510 --> 05:08:47,680
It might make the game go a little bit faster, so...

6680
05:08:49,170 --> 05:08:50,850
Um... Which is not a problem for me.

6681
05:08:50,970 --> 05:08:51,890
I've already played it.

6682
05:08:52,330 --> 05:08:53,510
Uh... Ducky, thanks for the gift!

6683
05:08:53,510 --> 05:08:54,130
Ducky!

6684
05:08:54,150 --> 05:08:55,530
Ducky, thank you for the 5 gift!

6685
05:08:55,750 --> 05:08:55,990
Ducky!

6686
05:08:56,010 --> 05:08:56,370
Thank you!

6687
05:08:57,350 --> 05:08:57,690
So...

6688
05:08:58,650 --> 05:08:58,990
Um...

6689
05:08:59,460 --> 05:09:00,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Oh!

6690
05:09:01,370 --> 05:09:02,910
This is an AI overview.

6691
05:09:03,070 --> 05:09:04,290
I don't know if I could trust that.

6692
05:09:04,550 --> 05:09:04,630
Oh!

6693
05:09:04,770 --> 05:09:05,570
June 26th!

6694
05:09:05,670 --> 05:09:06,290
So late June!

6695
05:09:07,730 --> 05:09:08,950
Wait, June 26th?

6696
05:09:09,010 --> 05:09:12,150
I might have to play it once I'm back from Japan my second trip.

6697
05:09:13,770 --> 05:09:16,350
Yeah, I'm going to Japan twice in June, you guys.

6698
05:09:18,670 --> 05:09:19,350
It's a...

6699
05:09:22,010 --> 05:09:27,630
It's a little... It's a little... It's a little, yeah.

6700
05:09:28,030 --> 05:09:32,270
And it's not for, like, idle things or anything like that.

6701
05:09:32,530 --> 05:09:33,830
It's actually all work.

6702
05:09:35,270 --> 05:09:43,910
In fact, I thought I would have only three recordings on my trip coming up in May.

6703
05:09:44,170 --> 05:09:47,670
But I actually added, potentially, a new one.

6704
05:09:48,790 --> 05:09:50,530
So that's four recordings.

6705
05:09:51,810 --> 05:09:53,130
Of exciting things.

6706
05:10:01,460 --> 05:10:04,240
So, honestly, I'm making the most out of that trip.

6707
05:10:04,640 --> 05:10:07,120
Like a crazy amount.

6708
05:10:08,860 --> 05:10:09,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6709
05:10:10,220 --> 05:10:11,700
Can't wait to see what you've been cooking.

6710
05:10:11,960 --> 05:10:13,760
I hope you guys will like everything.

6711
05:10:14,280 --> 05:10:18,220
It's been hard work, but hopefully it all pays out.

6712
05:10:19,480 --> 05:10:21,840
It all works out.

6713
05:10:22,080 --> 05:10:23,340
It pays off.

6714
05:10:25,820 --> 05:10:27,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6715
05:10:29,820 --> 05:10:30,940
But, yeah.

6716
05:10:37,830 --> 05:10:38,670
Work's off.

6717
05:10:39,690 --> 05:10:40,910
All pays work.

6718
05:10:42,890 --> 05:10:45,030
Yeah, and then August 23rd.

6719
05:10:45,650 --> 05:10:46,630
MGS Con.

6720
05:10:46,950 --> 05:10:48,590
And we have...

6721
05:10:48,590 --> 05:10:49,450
Delta.

6722
05:10:51,570 --> 05:10:54,770
I think, actually, it's just a couple days after.

6723
05:10:55,270 --> 05:10:55,470
No?

6724
05:10:56,470 --> 05:10:57,430
Proud of you, Mito.

6725
05:10:57,430 --> 05:10:58,390
Oh, thank you.

6726
05:10:58,850 --> 05:11:00,850
Mito Airlines sponsor win.

6727
05:11:02,130 --> 05:11:04,290
Oh, my poor wallet.

6728
05:11:07,170 --> 05:11:08,410
Like three days.

6729
05:11:08,610 --> 05:11:08,750
Yeah.

6730
05:11:10,030 --> 05:11:12,230
Especially, I got the...

6731
05:11:12,970 --> 05:11:14,210
Of course...

6732
05:11:14,210 --> 05:11:16,550
Of course, I had to get the early edition.

6733
05:11:16,950 --> 05:11:17,630
So...

6734
05:11:17,630 --> 05:11:20,450
I will be playing mine a couple days early.

6735
05:11:22,870 --> 05:11:24,750
I'm watching him stream this game.

6736
05:11:24,910 --> 05:11:26,010
Oh, thank you, Salmi.

6737
05:11:26,170 --> 05:11:27,330
Thank you for the raid, too.

6738
05:11:27,670 --> 05:11:28,750
I appreciate it so much.

6739
05:11:29,710 --> 05:11:31,530
Well, I actually am...

6740
05:11:31,530 --> 05:11:33,530
This was it for Ground Zeroes.

6741
05:11:33,630 --> 05:11:34,970
I did everything I wanted to do, too.

6742
05:11:35,010 --> 05:11:36,210
I'm really happy with it.

6743
05:11:36,330 --> 05:11:37,410
We did the main mission.

6744
05:11:37,590 --> 05:11:39,950
We did the Kojima mission.

6745
05:11:40,150 --> 05:11:41,810
We did the Raiden mission.

6746
05:11:41,930 --> 05:11:43,430
And we did Deja Vu even twice.

6747
05:11:43,430 --> 05:11:46,790
And we got to see the cute little genome soldiers walking around.

6748
05:11:48,150 --> 05:11:48,510
Yeah.

6749
05:11:49,530 --> 05:11:50,370
Oh, yes.

6750
05:11:50,470 --> 05:11:51,310
Let's try the hard quiz.

6751
05:11:51,450 --> 05:11:52,370
I'm just going to look it up, though.

6752
05:11:52,450 --> 05:11:53,310
I hope you guys don't mind.

6753
05:11:54,010 --> 05:11:54,370
Hold on.

6754
05:11:55,650 --> 05:11:58,430
Metal Gear Ground Zeroes...

6755
05:12:00,470 --> 05:12:01,370
Hard quiz.

6756
05:12:01,910 --> 05:12:05,470
I'll read you the questions and...

6757
05:12:06,470 --> 05:12:06,950
The...

6758
05:12:06,950 --> 05:12:08,050
What the...

6759
05:12:08,050 --> 05:12:08,390
Oh, wait.

6760
05:12:08,490 --> 05:12:08,890
Don't...

6761
05:12:08,890 --> 05:12:09,710
Oh, this is normal.

6762
05:12:10,430 --> 05:12:10,910
Okay.

6763
05:12:11,030 --> 05:12:11,710
Oh, no, no, no, no.

6764
05:12:11,710 --> 05:12:13,130
This one has the answers right below it.

6765
05:12:13,430 --> 05:12:14,610
IGN, why would you do that?

6766
05:12:22,110 --> 05:12:22,590
Um...

6767
05:12:22,590 --> 05:12:23,170
Matty!

6768
05:12:23,470 --> 05:12:25,050
Thank you so much for the dead gift.

6769
05:12:25,130 --> 05:12:25,810
Thank you!

6770
05:12:26,430 --> 05:12:27,050
Is that...

6771
05:12:27,050 --> 05:12:27,670
I've been wondering.

6772
05:12:27,790 --> 05:12:29,210
Is your profile picture...

6773
05:12:30,650 --> 05:12:31,130
Like...

6774
05:12:31,130 --> 05:12:32,650
Venom Suwako?

6775
05:12:40,690 --> 05:12:41,890
Do a YouTube video?

6776
05:12:42,110 --> 05:12:42,490
Let me see.

6777
05:12:44,750 --> 05:12:45,290
Oh, yeah.

6778
05:12:45,410 --> 05:12:46,830
I guess we can do the YouTube video...

6779
05:12:46,830 --> 05:12:48,410
Because I want to hear what it sounds like.

6780
05:12:59,610 --> 05:13:00,250
What's it called?

6781
05:13:00,810 --> 05:13:00,870
Oh.

6782
05:13:01,790 --> 05:13:02,590
Metal Gear...

6783
05:13:02,590 --> 05:13:04,650
Ground Zeroes...

6784
05:13:04,650 --> 05:13:05,970
Quiz card.

6785
05:13:16,560 --> 05:13:16,880
Okay.

6786
05:13:17,080 --> 05:13:17,360
Oh, wait.

6787
05:13:17,440 --> 05:13:18,760
This is an IGN video.

6788
05:13:19,300 --> 05:13:19,940
They're gonna...

6789
05:13:19,940 --> 05:13:21,680
They're gonna copyright strike me.

6790
05:13:23,980 --> 05:13:24,620
Wait, hold on.

6791
05:13:24,680 --> 05:13:25,640
I'm gonna pause the music.

6792
05:13:27,840 --> 05:13:28,160
Uh...

6793
05:13:28,160 --> 05:13:31,100
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...

6794
05:13:36,110 --> 05:13:36,850
Oh, here we go.

6795
05:13:38,210 --> 05:13:38,990
Oh, here we go.

6796
05:13:39,130 --> 05:13:39,370
You know what?

6797
05:13:39,410 --> 05:13:39,610
Hold on.

6798
05:13:39,690 --> 05:13:41,350
Let me make sure this doesn't have, like, somebody talking.

6799
05:13:41,550 --> 05:13:42,150
It's only two minutes.

6800
05:13:43,470 --> 05:13:49,990
Let me make sure it's not someone... speaking of... Okay.

6801
05:13:50,510 --> 05:13:51,030
Okay.

6802
05:13:51,350 --> 05:13:51,710
All right.

6803
05:13:52,990 --> 05:13:54,250
I will... hold on.

6804
05:13:54,510 --> 05:13:59,650
I will screen share... or window capture, I mean.

6805
05:14:00,570 --> 05:14:02,490
Screen share, like I'm on Discord.

6806
05:14:06,990 --> 05:14:09,470
Oh, ground zero squeeze hard.

6807
05:14:17,550 --> 05:14:21,310
I'll keep the person in whose video I'm using.

6808
05:14:26,700 --> 05:14:29,860
Let me make sure... hold on.

6809
05:14:29,980 --> 05:14:31,740
Let me get... let me crop it a little.

6810
05:14:31,860 --> 05:14:32,560
I couldn't see it.

6811
05:14:32,640 --> 05:14:33,180
It was too small.

6812
05:14:33,800 --> 05:14:34,580
There we go.

6813
05:14:36,180 --> 05:14:37,060
There we go.

6814
05:14:37,260 --> 05:14:37,340
Okay.

6815
05:14:39,700 --> 05:14:40,820
Thanks, Refusio.

6816
05:14:41,400 --> 05:14:41,760
Thank you.

6817
05:14:42,200 --> 05:14:42,540
All right.

6818
05:14:43,540 --> 05:14:45,920
I can't turn off the game, so sorry.

6819
05:14:46,060 --> 05:14:47,060
We'll just have that ambiance.

6820
05:14:49,280 --> 05:14:49,840
Oh.

6821
05:14:50,600 --> 05:14:51,160
Okay.

6822
05:14:51,420 --> 05:14:51,700
Wow.

6823
05:14:53,360 --> 05:14:53,920
Snack!

6824
05:14:54,360 --> 05:14:55,280
I'm gonna pause it.

6825
05:14:55,680 --> 05:14:56,380
Question one.

6826
05:14:56,600 --> 05:14:56,740
Okay.

6827
05:14:57,320 --> 05:15:00,620
What did Snake call Otakon's love for a certain female character?

6828
05:15:01,260 --> 05:15:02,740
Uh, Stockholm Syndrome.

6829
05:15:04,760 --> 05:15:06,140
Towards Sniper Wolf, no?

6830
05:15:07,780 --> 05:15:08,340
Oh!

6831
05:15:08,440 --> 05:15:08,800
No audio!

6832
05:15:09,340 --> 05:15:09,840
So sorry.

6833
05:15:09,980 --> 05:15:10,240
Thank you.

6834
05:15:11,420 --> 05:15:12,400
Stockholm Syndrome.

6835
05:15:15,340 --> 05:15:15,940
Yeah!

6836
05:15:18,940 --> 05:15:21,200
When Otakon visited Snake...

6837
05:15:21,200 --> 05:15:23,840
...at his cell after he was captured, he gave...

6838
05:15:23,840 --> 05:15:25,860
...him Sniper Wolf's handkerchief...

6839
05:15:25,860 --> 05:15:28,740
...rations, ketchup, and which level of security card?

6840
05:15:30,040 --> 05:15:30,480
...infinity?

6841
05:15:33,540 --> 05:15:34,560
Was it six?

6842
05:15:36,660 --> 05:15:37,880
There is no level 10.

6843
05:15:38,100 --> 05:15:38,320
Six?

6844
05:15:39,740 --> 05:15:40,900
I'm not looking at chat.

6845
05:15:41,040 --> 05:15:41,360
Oh!

6846
05:15:41,360 --> 05:15:41,980
Oh!

6847
05:15:41,980 --> 05:15:42,380
Oh!

6848
05:15:42,440 --> 05:15:43,400
Oh my gosh!

6849
05:15:43,600 --> 05:15:44,980
I'm not looking at chat this time, though.

6850
05:15:45,680 --> 05:15:45,800
Oh!

6851
05:15:46,200 --> 05:15:50,040
Which boss character was not a member of the newly formed Foxhound unit?

6852
05:15:51,360 --> 05:15:52,340
Boss character?

6853
05:15:54,320 --> 05:15:54,860
Uh...

6854
05:15:54,860 --> 05:15:55,440
Cyborg Ninja?

6855
05:15:57,480 --> 05:15:58,020
Ah!

6856
05:15:58,020 --> 05:15:58,300
Ah!

6857
05:15:59,380 --> 05:16:01,280
I always forget he's a boss.

6858
05:16:04,540 --> 05:16:05,020
What...

6859
05:16:05,020 --> 05:16:05,500
Oh my gosh.

6860
05:16:05,600 --> 05:16:08,540
What was the name of the studio later named to Kojima Productions at...

6861
05:16:08,540 --> 05:16:08,740
Oh!

6862
05:16:09,160 --> 05:16:09,400
Ah!

6863
05:16:10,480 --> 05:16:11,360
I don't know.

6864
05:16:12,720 --> 05:16:13,200
K...

6865
05:16:13,200 --> 05:16:14,940
Well, I guess it's not KCE Tokyo.

6866
05:16:15,320 --> 05:16:15,520
Sorry.

6867
05:16:15,660 --> 05:16:16,560
I'm not fast enough.

6868
05:16:16,560 --> 05:16:19,060
KCE Japan?

6869
05:16:21,900 --> 05:16:23,300
I would've said Tokyo.

6870
05:16:23,620 --> 05:16:23,840
Wait.

6871
05:16:24,100 --> 05:16:26,420
Maybe it's Konami Tech Development Center.

6872
05:16:27,180 --> 05:16:27,520
Oh!

6873
05:16:27,640 --> 05:16:27,920
No!

6874
05:16:28,160 --> 05:16:28,880
I was right!

6875
05:16:28,980 --> 05:16:29,880
KCE Japan!

6876
05:16:29,880 --> 05:16:30,920
Oh my gosh.

6877
05:16:31,120 --> 05:16:32,160
I would've...

6878
05:16:32,160 --> 05:16:33,680
I would've second-guessed myself.

6879
05:16:33,840 --> 05:16:34,820
Oh my god.

6880
05:16:35,100 --> 05:16:37,400
I would've also probably guessed Tokyo.

6881
05:16:37,600 --> 05:16:37,840
Right!

6882
05:16:39,260 --> 05:16:39,900
Oh!

6883
05:16:40,180 --> 05:16:41,480
It's in the opening.

6884
05:16:41,880 --> 05:16:42,060
Ah!

6885
05:16:42,920 --> 05:16:43,860
That one's tough.

6886
05:16:44,000 --> 05:16:44,580
That one's tough.

6887
05:16:45,020 --> 05:16:45,120
Yeah.

6888
05:16:45,620 --> 05:16:46,320
You're pretty good.

6889
05:16:46,860 --> 05:16:47,920
Can you hear it okay?

6890
05:16:48,620 --> 05:16:49,420
Oh my god!

6891
05:16:49,700 --> 05:16:50,820
Well, this one is so easy.

6892
05:16:50,920 --> 05:16:52,800
In MGS1, who did Autocon fall in love with?

6893
05:16:52,980 --> 05:16:53,540
This one!

6894
05:16:53,720 --> 05:16:55,040
He went so fast!

6895
05:16:55,520 --> 05:16:58,220
Well, I totally would've gotten Sniper Wolf easy.

6896
05:17:01,660 --> 05:17:02,620
Naomi Hunter.

6897
05:17:02,940 --> 05:17:03,600
That's disgusting.

6898
05:17:05,180 --> 05:17:05,660
Okay.

6899
05:17:06,820 --> 05:17:07,300
Question.

6900
05:17:07,920 --> 05:17:08,400
Okay.

6901
05:17:08,640 --> 05:17:12,000
Johnny Sasaki ended up unconscious and unclothed outside the holding cell.

6902
05:17:12,000 --> 05:17:15,140
In the Japanese version, he wore boxer shorts to hide his private parts.

6903
05:17:15,300 --> 05:17:16,780
How were they hidden in the Western version?

6904
05:17:16,880 --> 05:17:18,020
He was naked, baby!

6905
05:17:18,400 --> 05:17:19,360
He was pixelized!

6906
05:17:20,820 --> 05:17:22,300
It was pixelization.

6907
05:17:22,580 --> 05:17:22,760
Yeah!

6908
05:17:25,200 --> 05:17:26,180
We got that.

6909
05:17:27,420 --> 05:17:27,920
Oh!

6910
05:17:28,620 --> 05:17:30,280
Why are you glad that I remember that?

6911
05:17:31,300 --> 05:17:32,980
Covered with straw is so funny.

6912
05:17:35,060 --> 05:17:38,000
Snake attempted to give Meryl a handgun of which caliber?

6913
05:17:38,380 --> 05:17:38,500
Oh!

6914
05:17:38,500 --> 05:17:39,320
I...

6915
05:17:39,320 --> 05:17:39,740
I...

6916
05:17:40,520 --> 05:17:41,240
Uh...

6917
05:17:41,240 --> 05:17:41,720
45?

6918
05:17:44,480 --> 05:17:44,840
Uh...

6919
05:17:47,320 --> 05:17:48,460
Was it 45?

6920
05:17:49,240 --> 05:17:50,540
Oh my god!

6921
05:17:55,080 --> 05:17:56,260
I might be...

6922
05:17:56,260 --> 05:17:57,880
I might actually be good at this.

6923
05:18:01,600 --> 05:18:02,160
Oh my god!

6924
05:18:02,160 --> 05:18:05,500
After escaping the base, Snake and Meryl encountered a family of which animal?

6925
05:18:05,780 --> 05:18:06,940
The caribou!

6926
05:18:13,290 --> 05:18:13,810
I do.

6927
05:18:15,810 --> 05:18:17,110
Sorry, it's so quiet.

6928
05:18:17,910 --> 05:18:20,210
But they're saying the same thing as before.

6929
05:18:20,210 --> 05:18:20,470
Question.

6930
05:18:22,450 --> 05:18:26,450
In total, how many prototypes were made of the stealth camouflage Otacon developed?

6931
05:18:26,730 --> 05:18:27,010
Five!

6932
05:18:28,990 --> 05:18:29,590
Correct.

6933
05:18:30,970 --> 05:18:32,690
Now for the final question.

6934
05:18:33,450 --> 05:18:34,770
Let's finish this.

6935
05:18:35,910 --> 05:18:36,950
Have at you, Snake.

6936
05:18:37,050 --> 05:18:37,910
Have at you, Snake.

6937
05:18:39,390 --> 05:18:39,990
Oh!

6938
05:18:40,950 --> 05:18:41,290
Oh!

6939
05:18:41,710 --> 05:18:44,210
What did the PAL and PAL key signify?

6940
05:18:49,380 --> 05:18:51,420
Permissive action link?

6941
05:19:06,490 --> 05:19:07,770
Oh my god!

6942
05:19:08,090 --> 05:19:09,190
I wouldn't...

6943
05:19:09,490 --> 05:19:09,830
I'll...

6944
05:19:09,830 --> 05:19:10,690
Most of these though!

6945
05:19:11,150 --> 05:19:16,370
The ones that I'm second guessing on, I would not have gotten without the multiple choice.

6946
05:19:18,710 --> 05:19:19,910
Oh my god!

6947
05:19:20,570 --> 05:19:21,370
Oh my god!

6948
05:19:21,370 --> 05:19:22,070
I wouldn't have gotten...

6949
05:19:22,070 --> 05:19:24,410
I wouldn't have gotten that without it giving me the option.

6950
05:19:29,690 --> 05:19:30,290
Yeah!

6951
05:19:30,770 --> 05:19:31,550
Excellent job!

6952
05:19:31,730 --> 05:19:32,070
Thank you!

6953
05:19:32,810 --> 05:19:34,630
But there are no more special bonuses.

6954
05:19:35,070 --> 05:19:36,070
Which makes me wonder...

6955
05:19:37,150 --> 05:19:38,750
Why are you here then?

6956
05:19:38,910 --> 05:19:43,670
Why do you continue to answer questions while your memory betrays you?

6957
05:19:45,110 --> 05:19:47,330
You enjoy taking quizzes!

6958
05:19:50,530 --> 05:19:52,890
I almost spat out my drink!

6959
05:19:57,470 --> 05:19:57,990
Engine!

6960
05:20:04,370 --> 05:20:06,330
Difficulty is my first time on this too.

6961
05:20:06,570 --> 05:20:06,710
Yeah!

6962
05:20:07,890 --> 05:20:08,490
Oh my gosh.

6963
05:20:09,130 --> 05:20:10,490
Don't look at my recommended.

6964
05:20:17,950 --> 05:20:18,470
Fox!

6965
05:20:24,570 --> 05:20:26,410
Yeah, Nimi is streaming right now.

6966
05:20:26,410 --> 05:20:27,830
And we will raid into her.

6967
05:20:29,370 --> 05:20:30,970
We will raid into her.

6968
05:20:31,550 --> 05:20:32,030
So...

6969
05:20:32,030 --> 05:20:32,590
Thank you guys!

6970
05:20:33,170 --> 05:20:35,430
Thank you, thank you for Ground Zeroes.

6971
05:20:35,710 --> 05:20:38,630
Like I said, it'll be a little bit before we do five.

6972
05:20:39,250 --> 05:20:39,730
But...

6973
05:20:40,770 --> 05:20:41,450
But yeah!

6974
05:20:42,630 --> 05:20:43,910
This is a lot of fun.

6975
05:20:44,930 --> 05:20:45,410
And...

6976
05:20:45,410 --> 05:20:46,650
I love this game.

6977
05:20:46,850 --> 05:20:48,250
It's so fun to just...

6978
05:20:48,250 --> 05:20:48,710
You know...

6979
05:20:49,100 --> 05:20:50,470
Who knows she watches videos!

6980
05:20:51,630 --> 05:20:53,670
I'm embarrassed by when I watch them.

6981
05:20:56,230 --> 05:20:56,690
Um...

6982
05:20:57,170 --> 05:20:57,630
Yeah...

6983
05:20:57,630 --> 05:20:58,210
So...

6984
05:20:58,210 --> 05:20:58,970
Thank you guys!

6985
05:20:59,250 --> 05:21:00,290
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

6986
05:21:00,510 --> 05:21:02,090
And I will see you guys...

6987
05:21:02,090 --> 05:21:02,670
Uh...

6988
05:21:02,670 --> 05:21:03,690
When I see you next!

6989
05:21:04,870 --> 05:21:05,330
Uh...

6990
05:21:05,330 --> 05:21:06,070
Uh...

6991
05:21:06,070 --> 05:21:06,370
Happy...

6992
05:21:07,230 --> 05:21:07,690
Uh...

6993
05:21:07,690 --> 05:21:08,210
East!

6994
05:21:09,680 --> 05:21:10,290
Atsumito!

6995
05:21:11,330 --> 05:21:11,940
Iってらっしゃい!

6996
05:21:12,750 --> 05:21:13,970
More questions...

6997
05:21:13,970 --> 05:21:14,850
Vocals...

6998
05:21:15,690 --> 05:21:16,630
Hinted!

6999
05:21:17,210 --> 05:21:17,710
Bye-bye!
