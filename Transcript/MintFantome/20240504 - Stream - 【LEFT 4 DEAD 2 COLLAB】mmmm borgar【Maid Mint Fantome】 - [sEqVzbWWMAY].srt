1
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:02,680
I was in stream... no, the studio mode.

2
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,700
That wouldn't make sense... oh my gosh.

3
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,360
I was just checking the sound.

4
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,820
I was making sure you could hear the...

5
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,920
I was making sure the game volume was on.

6
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,960
Hi everybody!

7
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,440
Welcome to Left 4 Dead 2!

8
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
That's how I check the audio.

9
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,950
I'm not in yet with everybody.

10
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,530
Oh, I need to set up probably Fugi too, don't I?

11
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,010
Oh, she's a pervert, you guys.

12
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,470
I saw what she was doing.

13
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,490
I saw.

14
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,150
I saw the pictures that Hanya was taking.

15
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,230
She's playing Bunny Garden.

16
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,110
She just posted in the group that she was like...

17
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,030
She was like, could you guys give me 5 minutes?

18
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,810
I'm so sorry.

19
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,740
8.15?

20
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,780
That's so long.

21
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,380
I'm ready whenever.

22
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,340
Takes 1 to know 1.

23
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,920
Happy Friday.

24
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,560
Happy Friday!

25
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,800
Yippee!

26
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,260
What was that?

27
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,740
Sorry, I'm a little unprepared, I think.

28
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,360
Log in with Discord.

29
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,220
Authorize.

30
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,220
Blah, blah, blah.

31
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,700
Blah, blah, blah.

32
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,880
Blah, blah, blah.

33
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,060
Blah, blah, blah.

34
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,980
Blah, blah, blah.

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,820
Wait, how do I do this?

36
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,400
Oh, group.

37
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,240
And then, don't look.

38
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,560
Don't look.

39
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,980
Said don't look.

40
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,860
Okay.

41
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,800
That should be good.

42
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,120
Whenever I join.

43
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,360
Whenever I join the voice chat.

44
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,020
Happy Friday!

45
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,600
What was that?

46
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,620
It's nothing.

47
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,860
I told you don't look.

48
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,780
I told you.

49
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,880
I told you.

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,860
Let's see what the mods look like.

51
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,500
Not yet.

52
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,420
Not yet.

53
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,380
You must be patient.

54
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,280
Ducky, thank you for the gifted.

55
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,620
Also Spank, thank you for the dono.

56
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,320
And Dragos, thank you for the 10 gifted.

57
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,880
Wandering Taco, thank you for the 10 gifted.

58
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,860
Sukudragon, thank you for the 10 gifted.

59
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,260
Shino, thank you for the 20 gifted.

60
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,280
Hope I got everybody from earlier.

61
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,780
Hope I got everybody.

62
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,900
Blue Archive mods.

63
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,700
Oh my gosh, there were so many Blue Archive mods.

64
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,400
So many.

65
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,200
But unfortunately, I do not have any this time.

66
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,420
Maybe another time.

67
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,340
I think I picked some good ones though this time.

68
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,480
I think.

69
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,420
How are you guys?

70
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,060
How are you?

71
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,260
Good?

72
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,920
How was your week been?

73
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,560
Did you...

74
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,660
Yo man, let me get that Berg, please.

75
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,700
It looks so good, right?

76
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,340
Did you get the Shrek tank at least?

77
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,760
No, I haven't.

78
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,160
But I don't have it enabled.

79
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
Because I used the Shrek tank last time.

80
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,280
You know what?

81
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,680
I gotta do stuff that you guys aren't gonna expect.

82
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,580
Okay?

83
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,060
Um...

84
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,140
Prepping the ladies to destroy Bricky.

85
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,500
Who?

86
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,780
What?

87
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,520
Destroy what?

88
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,220
Is that a character in this game?

89
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,780
Hello, welcome to my membership.

90
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,380
Hello, hello.

91
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,500
Hello, happy Friday.

92
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,320
Hello, hello.

93
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,140
Hello, hello.

94
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,460
Anyone else watch the amazing Digital Circus?

95
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:03,880
Oh my gosh.

96
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,780
I was like in the middle of the episode.

97
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,460
And then I was like, oh.

98
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,260
I'm gonna take a shower.

99
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
And then I took a shower.

100
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,940
And then I was like, oh.

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,580
I haven't watched this week's...

102
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm so late.

103
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,440
I didn't watch this week's Blue Archive yet.

104
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,560
So I watched that instead.

105
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,320
I didn't watch that instead.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,320
But yeah, the Digital Circus came out.

107
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,040
Like, oh my gosh.

108
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,220
When I saw it, it was insane.

109
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,220
I was like, it said it had come out 49 minutes ago.

110
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,100
And then it was already at 1 million views.

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,520
So I don't even know.

112
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,700
What is it at right now?

113
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Just wanna let you know.

114
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,120
I've started to get more MGS brain rot because of you.

115
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,900
And started streaming Metal Gear recently.

116
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,360
Have fun.

117
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,540
Thank you.

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,440
Yippee.

119
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
1.5 in 2 hours.

120
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,340
That's crazy.

121
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,300
All the children are probably like...

122
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,220
Digital Circus.

123
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,260
You know?

124
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,860
Probably like, oh.

125
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,160
Um.

126
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,220
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,120
Wait.

128
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,320
Henya.

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,380
Who is your favorite girl?

130
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,760
Who is your favorite girl, Henya?

131
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,980
A wonder.

132
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,720
Yeah, today I'm playing with Henya, Matara, and Haruka.

133
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,720
Again, we played last week.

134
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,560
We played Helldivers 2.

135
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,240
Um.

136
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Which.

137
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,500
Oof.

138
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,520
Man.

139
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm so.

140
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,700
Oof.

141
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,000
But um.

142
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,060
We are playing Left 4 Dead 2 today.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,640
Yippee.

144
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:54,720
And I've got some silly mods all set up for you guys.

145
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,780
You guys.

146
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,540
You guys.

147
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,240
So.

148
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,180
Did you download the Solid Snake mod?

149
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,660
I.

150
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,200
I did.

151
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,480
But um.

152
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,940
I did not have it enabled.

153
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,240
Um.

154
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,340
I know.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Shocking.

156
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,500
Shocking.

157
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,420
I thought you said no mods yet.

158
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,680
When did I ever say that?

159
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
When did I ever say that?

160
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Could I get an early happy birthday from Sultry Voice Minto?

161
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,720
Happy birthday, Mic Mac.

162
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,460
This is Sultry.

163
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:49,070
I was trying

164
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,760
to think of something like... something else to say.

165
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,220
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

166
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,820
Don't look, Haruka.

167
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,440
It's... good.

168
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,720
Don't look.

169
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,200
She was surprised about bunny garden.

170
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,900
Rin-chan, my Oshino waifu.

171
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Rin-chan, so cute.

172
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,640
We have the same bunny girl.

173
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,080
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,820
No, sir.

175
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,680
Certified Minto Mancini moment.

176
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,240
What do you mean by that?

177
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,680
What do you mean by that?

178
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,400
Do the MGS5 birthday song.

179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,060
Happy birthday, congratulations.

180
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,360
Happy birthday, salutations.

181
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,820
Happy birthday, may your skies be blue.

182
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,720
Happy birthday to you.

183
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,960
Why are you clapping?

184
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,640
Because it's a song.

185
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,380
You're clapping it, don't you?

186
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,120
Don't you?

187
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,840
I love that.

188
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,260
I love that birthday song so much.

189
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,560
I wonder...

190
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,400
But Tara's not even looking at the chat.

191
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,560
Is it safe to stream this?

192
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,980
Yeah, I streamed on YouTube and they didn't hate me.

193
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,480
I don't even think my stream got demonetized, which is so...

194
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,760
I mean, well, to be honest, I didn't get that bad, that far.

195
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,580
You know, sometimes in bunny girl, the bunny garden game, it gets like kind of, you know, whoo.

196
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,780
But...

197
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,740
I think we were good.

198
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,080
Typical Akiba arcade clapper.

199
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,120
You shut up.

200
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,300
You shut the hell up.

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,680
Shut...

202
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,580
How dare you?

203
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,160
How?

204
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,780
That was the most offensive.

205
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,180
That was...

206
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,640
Huh?

207
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,480
Neat, ma'am.

208
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,500
You good in two mins, Henya?

209
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,300
We're all good.

210
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,400
It's you, Metara.

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:28,980
It's you.

212
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,560
I think we're all good, Metara.

213
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,720
Yeah.

214
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,680
Oh my gosh, it's already been almost 15 minutes.

215
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,900
It's already been almost 15 minutes.

216
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,920
That's crazy.

217
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,240
Oh.

218
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,160
She said, I have been ready.

219
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,320
And Metara started the call.

220
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,700
Okay.

221
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm going into the call, you guys.

222
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,760
I'll see you guys later, okay?

223
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm going in.

224
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm going in.

225
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,180
Great.

226
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,280
Thank you for coming.

227
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,420
Hello.

228
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,420
Oh, hello.

229
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,000
Hello.

230
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,620
Hello.

231
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,680
Hello.

232
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,280
Hi.

233
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,980
Oh my god, Mint, that is so embarrassing.

234
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,780
What?

235
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,040
That's so embarrassing.

236
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,420
What did I do?

237
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,340
I can't believe you did that.

238
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,940
What did I do?

239
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,140
Oh, sorry.

240
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,320
Am I the cringe?

241
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,140
Oh gosh.

242
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,240
Henya did not like that.

243
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,780
No, it's okay.

244
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,980
I was thinking about Rin-chan.

245
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,840
Me too.

246
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,440
I do, honestly.

247
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,500
Have you all been playing that bunny game that Haruka bought?

248
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,180
Yes.

249
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,840
Sell the game to me.

250
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,180
Okay, you go into debt.

251
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,360
You give all your money to bunny girls and then you can give them gifts.

252
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,860
You give them like, Gucci.

253
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,160
You give them...

254
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,620
Gucci?

255
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,620
Yeah, it's Gucci with a Q.

256
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,880
I gave them panties.

257
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,360
Yeah!

258
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,200
Yeah!

259
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,340
Oh yeah, you can give lingerie.

260
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,580
Yeah!

261
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,000
You can take their picture.

262
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,580
It's like a dating sim.

263
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,580
But they take your money.

264
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,300
Yeah, and you can drink alcohol.

265
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,660
Yeah, you drink alcohol!

266
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,860
And you can take a picture with them.

267
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,060
No, not with them, but you take a picture of a girl.

268
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,440
And you can pick a pose, what pose you want her to do it.

269
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,720
And stuff.

270
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,440
You can go on vacation with them.

271
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,100
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.

272
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,240
Are we just gonna glaze over the fact?

273
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,600
Oh, giving underwear to these women who are working?

274
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,080
It's a gift.

275
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,920
You're giving them the gift of lingerie.

276
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,400
It's a gift.

277
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
They like it.

278
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,400
So my favorite game in Yakuza 0 was the hostess game.

279
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,660
Oh, you'll love this then.

280
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,340
You'll love this.

281
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,800
You'll love it.

282
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,360
You'll love it.

283
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,220
But people are gonna know that I'm a pervert.

284
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,720
I don't want them to know that.

285
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,540
That's okay.

286
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,900
I don't want them to know that I'm a pervert.

287
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,640
It's a secret.

288
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,060
You just said you were.

289
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,800
Just now.

290
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,520
No, no, no.

291
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,160
It's a secret.

292
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,480
Nobody's gonna really know.

293
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm like, haha, I'm joking on screen.

294
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,900
How would they know?

295
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,560
How would they know?

296
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,080
How would they know?

297
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,520
How would they know?

298
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,540
They're never gonna know.

299
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,200
They're never gonna know.

300
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,720
How would they know?

301
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,220
They won't know.

302
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,520
What?

303
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,260
Did I just buy a game where I can give underwear to women?

304
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,420
Yeah, you're a little pervert.

305
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
They'll love it.

306
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,540
They'll love it.

307
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,080
Hentai.

308
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,120
Hentai.

309
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,820
Hentai.

310
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,780
No, no, hentai.

311
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,920
It's called socializing.

312
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,120
I think I'm very good at getting good at socializing now.

313
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,820
It's so true.

314
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,320
Before this, I would be too scared to go to a bunny girl bar.

315
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
But now, I think I feel very confident.

316
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,440
I live there!

317
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,120
Oh, my God.

318
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,320
So this is the socializing in 2024?

319
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,560
Yes!

320
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,640
Yes!

321
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,100
Okay.

322
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,660
I think I'm learning a lot now.

323
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,360
Yeah.

324
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,780
Henya and Min, since you played the game, who do you think would be my favorite girl in the game?

325
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,640
Din chan.

326
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,580
I haven't talked to anyone except Din chan.

327
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,220
Din chan bunny garden?

328
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,700
Din chan is best girl.

329
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,300
Din chan bunny garden?

330
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,520
Yes.

331
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,900
Din chan is my wife.

332
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,640
Yeah.

333
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,440
Wait, she's my wife, Henya.

334
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,740
No, she's my wife.

335
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,740
Henya, I think you need to find...

336
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,660
Henya, she looked at me first, Henya.

337
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,120
Min, I thought we got married and now you say your wife is Min chan?

338
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,620
When did we get married?

339
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
When did you guys get married?

340
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,620
What?

341
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,540
Why wasn't I there to help with the marriage?

342
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,620
I know we're married.

343
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,600
But how can I help with this marriage?

344
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,340
I mean, it'd be wise to, Henya.

345
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,860
I now pronounce this marriage hikimori and death.

347
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,920
Hikikomori.

348
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,440
You may now play the game.

349
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,720
Yay!

350
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,720
Because kissing is illegal.

351
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,380
You may now gift lingerie to your girlfriend.

352
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:54,980
Yay!

353
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,440
Min chan!

354
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,180
Okay, Henya.

355
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,860
Let's go and see Min chan together.

356
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,140
Yay!

357
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:01,680
Yay!

358
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,160
Yes, everyone.

359
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,300
Thanks for coming to this collab.

360
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,840
It was very short, sweet.

361
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,000
But everyone, I'm going to play in this bunny game now.

362
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,340
Live reaction.

363
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,740
At the beginning, that's the three girls that you get in the game?

364
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

365
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,840
I think the little blue haired one seems really cute.

366
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,160
She is very cute, but she's like...

367
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Everybody's cute.

368
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,840
Yeah, they're all cute.

369
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,100
She's like the cool type.

370
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,020
She's like a...

371
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,180
Oh, I love cool women.

372
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,160
Maybe you'll like her then.

373
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

374
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,640
Okay, you have her.

375
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,560
We'll have Min chan.

376
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,020
I'm joking.

377
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,020
What about you, Haru?

378
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,920
Of the three girls on the picture, is there one that speaks to you the most?

379
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,680
I think the alcohol is speaking to me a lot.

380
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,440
The one in the middle.

381
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,600
Do they all have breasts that big?

382
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,460
Oh, yeah.

383
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,020
Yeah, everybody has a big booboo.

384
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,460
Yeah.

385
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,100
Oh, I didn't even realize about the breasts.

386
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,260
I was staring at the ears.

387
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,200
Look at their panties, too.

388
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,860
When I had my nii-fei sponsor...

389
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,580
You can look at their panties, too.

390
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't worry.

391
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,160
You can look at their panties, too.

392
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,960
Yeah, don't show your panties.

393
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:58,580
Yeah.

394
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,720
She didn't see any of the women's.

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,860
I'd be like, wow, her butt is jiggling while she's shooting the gun.

396
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,880
And Haruka was like, what?

397
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,560
I didn't even notice that.

398
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,880
Look at her butt.

399
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Isn't it huge?

400
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,800
I literally was just staring at the alcohol in their hand, as well.

401
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,880
I was like, oh, that's a nice alcoholic drink.

402
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,860
Yeah, there's a lot of alcohol in there.

403
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,160
I just got an alcohol, actually.

404
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,580
My first alcohol of the week.

405
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,060
Whoa.

406
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,720
They have a wine in the game.

407
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,280
Yeah.

408
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,700
Oh, I love wine.

409
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,000
No, I'm having a little bit of cognac.

410
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,140
Oh, I love wine.

411
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,240
I'm going to stop the game.

412
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,600
I like the fact that the short-haired girl has like a gradient black to blue in the tips of her hair.

413
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:34,940
Oh, yeah.

414
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,700
That's what I like.

415
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,580
That's so cute.

416
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,000
I like her hair a lot.

417
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,500
Yeah.

418
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,060
It's like my hair.

419
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,120
You like my hair?

420
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,620
It is actually kind of like Mint's hair.

421
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,760
Your hair is white to blue, so it's sort of there.

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,380
Yeah.

423
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,940
Yeah, sort of, sort of.

424
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,400
Yeah.

425
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,220
But Nichan is the best.

426
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,120
Yeah, Nichan is so cute.

427
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,120
Holy shit, you're getting cocked, you jerk.

428
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,300
She just got married and she's already replacing with a virtual wife.

429
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,040
That's so sad.

430
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,960
That's kind of the reality of things, isn't it?

431
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,520
Yeah.

432
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,100
Yeah.

433
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,560
Nothing can beat two feet.

434
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,340
This is my life now.

435
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,320
Can you girls join off me?

436
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,720
Because I'm trying to invite you on my screen right now.

437
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,300
Oh, it keeps...

438
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,880
Your name keeps like popping up.

439
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,140
It just says Mataraka and over and over and over.

440
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,760
I think it's like the games try to remind you I exist.

441
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,220
It's like...

442
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,780
It keeps just saying Mataraka.

443
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,200
Don't forget about me.

444
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,080
It's like scrolling.

445
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,920
Don't forget about me.

446
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,240
I'm like clicking Henya invite and Mint.

447
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,520
Is it sending you the invite?

448
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,420
Oh, I just got one.

449
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,420
Nice.

450
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,080
Wait a minute.

451
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,640
I'm trying to.

452
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,580
Play a game.

453
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,700
Is normal difficulty okay?

454
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,360
Harder?

455
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,440
I only played this game once for two hours a few years ago.

456
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,280
Yeah, normal is good.

457
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,960
Normal is good.

458
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,340
Yeah.

459
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,640
Good, good, good, good.

460
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,620
Wait, how do I...

461
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,600
I click my name.

462
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:43,880
Oh.

463
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,500
I go away.

464
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,720
Hold on.

465
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,560
I'm getting rid of Steam.

466
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,960
You guys did get my invite, right?

467
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,240
Because I know Mint is in here.

468
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,460
Yeah, I'm in.

469
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,140
Awesome.

470
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,520
Yay!

471
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,420
I'm excited.

472
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,400
Wait, is that a hiccup?

473
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,100
I was burping This is very cute.

474
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,160
It's not.

475
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,500
Shut the fuck up.

476
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,160
It was so cute.

477
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,120
I will literally strangle you with Rin-chan's bunny ears and you can't do this shit.

478
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,780
Oh my god.

479
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,580
Stop.

480
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,220
You're turning me on.

481
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,080
Wait, what?

482
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,340
I don't think you realize that.

483
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,660
Oh, don't look.

484
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,280
Don't look, everybody.

485
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,180
I'm going to be Nick.

486
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,120
Actually, no.

487
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,680
What people like that?

488
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,340
Hold on.

489
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah.

490
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
The game crashed.

491
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,360
Oh, no.

492
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,260
Did the game really crash?

493
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,360
Yeah.

494
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,860
Hold on.

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,080
Hold on.

496
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm rebooting.

497
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,420
Reloading.

498
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,710
Man, you're laughing.

499
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,410
When I was in the loading screen, I thought that was part of the game and I was severely freaked out.

500
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,690
Scared?

501
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,530
Yeah.

502
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,250
I was a little scared.

503
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,750
I was like...

504
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,470
It's like a little girl laugh.

505
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,690
God, I hate...

506
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,770
I hate it so much.

507
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,810
Oh, god.

508
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,330
Cute.

509
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,470
You guys pick characters.

510
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,710
Oh, my god.

511
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,990
I still have the mons on.

512
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,270
So, this is going to be fun.

513
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,450
I have my mons on, too.

514
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,270
I'm so excited.

515
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,130
I want to see.

516
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,770
That's why I'm laughing.

517
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,230
That's why I'm laughing.

518
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,890
For me, Fit, you pick Coco Kiru from Hololive on my end.

519
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:02,810
Oh.

520
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:03,890
Yeah.

521
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,170
I'm Woody.

522
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:06,950
Wait.

523
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,290
Like from the Toy Stories?

524
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:08,830
Yeah.

525
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,390
Nice.

526
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,230
That's so funny.

527
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,790
No.

528
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,670
We basically...

529
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,370
I'm participating in like this little tournament for this game that a friend's organizing.

530
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,830
So, I figure I need to actually play the game before the tournament.

531
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:21,990
Oh.

532
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,250
Yeah.

533
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,610
Yeah.

534
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,090
I hope you have fun.

535
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:25,870
Yeah.

536
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,310
Thank you.

537
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,470
So, Hanya is going to be coach.

538
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,810
Who should I be?

539
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,870
Should I be Nick, then?

540
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,530
Yeah.

541
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,650
Whoever you want.

542
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,650
I'm just doing random.

543
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,630
If that's okay.

544
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,710
Whoever it gives me.

545
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,030
I'm going to be...

546
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,590
Hanya wants you to be coach.

547
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,750
Please be coach.

548
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:40,990
Coach?

549
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,390
Okay.

550
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,810
I'm going to be coach, then.

551
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,050
If there's four characters, I can be the other one.

552
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:45,990
I'll be Rochelle, then.

553
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,310
Okay.

554
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,530
Coachy.

555
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,050
Coachy.

556
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,510
You're the puffer fish lady from SpongeBob for me.

557
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,530
Hell yeah.

558
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,130
Oh.

559
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,290
Oh.

560
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,430
The driving school lady?

561
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:57,890
Yeah.

562
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,230
Yeah.

563
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:58,470
Yeah.

564
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,350
Oh.

565
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,510
Oh, my gosh.

566
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,110
I'm so excited.

567
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,230
Nice.

568
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:02,890
Let's go.

569
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,470
Prices aren't the only things getting slashed.

570
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:07,930
Ooh.

571
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,410
All right.

572
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,870
Anything I need to know about the game?

573
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,830
My wallet's getting slashed.

574
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,970
Wait.

575
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,670
Is this your first time playing Matara?

576
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,090
Mm.

577
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,350
Oh, really?

578
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,670
I played, like, one time a few years ago, but I don't know if it was this Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 1.

579
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,570
Because I didn't own this game.

580
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,250
Oh.

581
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,330
So, I don't know if I played this game or if I played the pre...

582
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,250
I own Left 4 Dead 1.

583
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:23,770
Okay.

584
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,330
Maybe it's a 1.

585
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,430
Just shoot.

586
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,810
Just shoot.

587
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:27,930
Yeah.

588
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,290
I figured.

589
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,130
Is there, like, melee?

590
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,190
Is there anything, like, special that I need to know?

591
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,110
I think this...

592
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,330
Ooh.

593
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,490
The first level will kind of teach you the controls.

594
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:34,850
Yeah.

595
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:35,210
Okay.

596
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,710
I played this one.

597
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,850
We're in the hotel.

598
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,530
Yes.

599
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:39,690
Yes.

600
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:39,790
Right?

601
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:40,690
Yeah.

602
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,750
And then we go to the shopping mall.

603
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,390
Ooh.

604
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:43,790
You remember.

605
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,370
Nice.

606
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:44,970
I played...

607
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,490
This is the...

608
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,310
I played this exact, like...

609
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,910
Can this wait?

610
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,450
Just one time.

611
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,590
A one-time night sale.

612
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,870
Is this...

613
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,010
Loud enough?

614
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,410
Because the game is kind of loud for me.

615
00:23:59,330 --> 00:23:59,830
Is it?

616
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,490
Chad, how's the audio?

617
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,190
Is it...

618
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,930
I think I turned mine down.

619
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,270
I feel very loud.

620
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,570
Inside.

621
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,370
I turned mine down, like, so much.

622
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,850
I think those things are down there.

623
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,930
Is audio gone?

624
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,650
Yeah.

625
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,230
Let's see the audio.

626
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,450
How do I switch?

627
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,730
How do I switch from gun to axe?

628
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,710
Or can I only pick one?

629
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,550
You can pick a second weapon.

630
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,770
You have to pick a second weapon.

631
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,590
Oh, wait.

632
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,610
Oh, I guess you can only have the gun or the axe.

633
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:22,790
Yeah.

634
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,850
It's only, like, gun or the axe.

635
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,170
Or...

636
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,990
I'll pick the gun.

637
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,950
Oh.

638
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,550
I'll pick the gun then.

639
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:28,850
Yeah.

640
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,250
It's not letting me have both the gun and the...

641
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,990
I guess that's the...

642
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,450
You can pick a better...

643
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,830
You can pick up another gun later, so if you want to get an axe for now...

644
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,630
Yeah.

645
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,090
I think so.

646
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,890
Axe or crowbar is better.

647
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,490
What do y'all think?

648
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,130
I got the axe.

649
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,290
Crowbar!

650
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,910
What was that line?

651
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,510
It's like...

652
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,110
Here comes Johnny!

653
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,970
Here comes...

654
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,710
Hang on!

655
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:51,830
Hang on!

656
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:52,730
Hang on!

657
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,650
Hang on!

658
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:53,830
Hang on!

659
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,110
Oh, my God.

660
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,750
It's so loud.

661
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,810
Oh, we just moved together?

662
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,230
Yeah.

663
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,810
This game is so loud.

664
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,450
I had to turn it down so much.

665
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:02,470
I know.

666
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,670
Oh, my God.

667
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:02,810
Yeah!

668
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,770
I think there's no...

669
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,030
We're killing Teletubbies on my screen.

670
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,490
It's funny.

671
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:11,990
Teletubbies!

672
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:12,570
Teletubbies!

673
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,710
Ah!

674
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,850
Is it normal that...

675
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,010
I keep thinking the blood on the screen is mine, but it's the zombies.

676
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,630
It makes it really hard to see.

677
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,850
There's blood on screen?

678
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,710
You might be able to turn it down a little bit, maybe.

679
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:23,830
I don't know.

680
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,590
I don't see blood on my screen.

681
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:25,850
I don't see blood on my screen.

682
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,370
You're just getting hurt.

683
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,610
I see so much blood.

684
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:27,770
I got Katana!

685
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:29,770
Katana!

686
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,370
Oh!

687
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,150
Katana!

688
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,390
Sweetie!

689
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,370
Oh, Kari!

690
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:34,770
Ow!

691
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,330
Oh, wait.

692
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,130
Oh, I'm so sorry.

693
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,650
Ow!

694
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,450
Oh, it's not you.

695
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:37,970
It's the zombie.

696
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,450
Hi!

697
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,270
Oh, woman.

698
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,110
Stop!

699
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:41,550
Woman.

700
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,010
Woman.

701
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,450
Go to the side.

702
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:44,710
Sorry.

703
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,250
Stop!

704
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:48,770
Sorry.

705
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,050
Stop!

706
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:49,490
Sorry!

707
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,770
It was an accident.

708
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,750
Oh!

709
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,930
Oh, yeah.

710
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,250
It was an accident.

711
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,510
Sorry.

712
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:55,750
I'm sorry.

713
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,250
Sorry.

714
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,130
I'm coming to help you.

715
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,210
I'm just flashing.

716
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,390
It might be anyone, to be honest.

717
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,330
It could be anyone.

718
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,330
Where are you guys?

719
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:04,770
I need...

720
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,350
You guys wait just a minute.

721
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,070
I need to turn off the blood.

722
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,690
Turn off the blood?

723
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,890
Okay.

724
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,790
How do I turn off this blood?

725
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,870
Oh, make sure you don't...

726
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,370
Oh.

727
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,270
Thank you for the magnum.

728
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:17,650
Me?

729
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,310
Here.

730
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:18,870
I didn't give that.

731
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,050
This is for you.

732
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,430
Oh, my God.

733
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,570
What's wrong with you?

734
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,310
Oh, my God.

735
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,850
Oh.

736
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,410
Oh!

737
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,470
Oh, my God.

738
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,970

00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,370

There's meantкі.

742
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,930
No escape?

743
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,070
Is it your job, what about you guys' job?

744
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,290

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,130
I love you guys.

746
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:49,790
WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS TIME?

747
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,430
What is going on?

748
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,430

What exactly is going on?

752
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,810

00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,630
Behind, behind!

757
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,050
Oh!

758
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,030
Oh, sorry!

759
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,710
I keep forgetting, if you get puked on, it will start a horde.

760
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,710
It will come towards you.

761
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,270
Oh no!

762
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,050
Oh my god.

763
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,410
Mint protected Matara-Khan?

764
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,210
That's my girl.

765
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,430
Get out of my way!

766
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,230
I'm not trying to protect you at all.

767
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,850
Wait, I can't hold a katana and gun at the same time?

768
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,390
No, you can only have like one thing.

769
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:22,850
No way!

770
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,350
Uh oh, it's all fiery down here.

771
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,370
So if I didn't use the axe, would I have less blood?

772
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,630
Because I cannot see anything.

773
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,410
I hate it.

774
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:31,730
Oh, sorry.

775
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,110
I thought you loved it.

776
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,370
Sorry, I just saw Waluigi.

777
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,110
Waluigi!

778
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,370
Oh my god.

779
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,930
Girls, if you see another weapon on the floor that isn't a gun, can you let me know?

780
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:46,750
Yeah!

781
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,830
How do I get down there?

782
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,430
Run!

783
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:52,930
Get adrenaline.

784
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,350
Run, run, run!

785
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,930
Should've grabbed the gun.

786
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,070
Should've could've would've.

787
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:55,850
What's this?

788
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,530
Am I stuck?

789
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,030
I got you, girl.

790
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:58,350
Oh, here you go.

791
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,950
Oh, who's getting Henya?

792
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,890
Henya!

793
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,930
Oh my god, Henya.

794
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,030
Henya, do you have a house with her, baby?

795
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,250
No!

796
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,610
Uh oh.

797
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,890
Don't get it!

798
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,450
Haruka behind you!

799
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,410
I don't think you're doing so good, Henya.

800
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,030
Henya, I'm trying.

801
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,330
Henya, I'm gonna scoot close to you.

802
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:21,930
Oh, wait.

803
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:22,570
It's okay.

804
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,150
Haruka on me.

805
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,130
Hi, thank you.

806
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,090
Oh, shit.

807
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,640
Oh, shit.

808
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,740
Riding Haruka.

809
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,660
Uh oh.

810
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:30,900
No!

811
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,320
There's a big guy coming.

812
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,680
It's okay.

813
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,160
He's on fire.

814
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,260
I need a bigger...

815
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,760
I need a gun.

816
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,280
Oh, I'm on fire now, too.

817
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,000
It's cuffing season.

818
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,680
All the da-da-da-da.

819
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,420
I need a gun.

820
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
I need a big boy.

821
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,880
Give me a big boy.

822
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,300
What are you talking about?

823
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,280
Can you...

824
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,820
Oh, it's a song.

825
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,940
Can you pick up...

826
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,240
Henya, there's a health pack here.

827
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:51,740
Where are you?

828
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,220
Henya's dead.

829
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,140
Yeah, okay.

830
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,320
Wait.

831
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,520
Haru.

832
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:53,740
Haru.

833
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,520
Can I give you this health pack?

834
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,380
Oh, fuck.

835
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,920
Face rerun.

836
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,060
Wait.

837
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,260
Sorry.

838
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,080
Haruka!

839
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,100
I almost jumped out the window.

840
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,640
Hold on.

841
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,580
I'm gonna come over that way.

842
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,060
I'm gonna heal you in a second.

843
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,600
I don't know if you...

844
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,020
Can we...

845
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,040
Can we heal Henya?

846
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,640
Henya's dead.

847
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,100
No, we have to get her at the...

848
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,300
We have to get her at the...

849
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,160
The safe house.

850
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,780
Haru, come to me.

851
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,780
And I'm gonna heal you.

852
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,060
Come.

853
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,280
Come.

854
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,560
Come here.

855
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,620
Stop.

856
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:17,820
Stop.

857
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:17,960
Stop.

858
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,580
I'm happy.

859
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,460
Henya happy.

860
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,860
Why is this fire still going?

861
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,540
Henya, I'm so sorry.

862
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,020
Because it hates us.

863
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,300
You know?

864
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,020
Oh my god.

865
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,880
Oh my god.

866
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,280
What?

867
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,320
Oh, we can rescue her.

868
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,720
I see her.

869
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,340
Why are they always...

870
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,700
Oh my god.

871
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,340
Oh my god.

872
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:37,440
Help me.

873
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,140
Help me.

874
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,620
Help me.

875
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,260
Help me.

876
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,420
Help me.

877
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:40,620
Help me.

878
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:40,760
Help me.

879
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,200
Help me.

880
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:41,500
Help me.

881
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,840
Help me.

882
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,120
Help me.

883
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,300
Help me.

884
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,320
Help me.

885
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,100
I think this is starting off real nice.

886
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,640
Shove them back.

887
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,580
All right.

888
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,580
Let's stick together.

889
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,440
Maybe.

890
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,880
And also, you know, I lost a lot of health from like, I don't know, it was like PvP, you know, like from team.

891
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,100
Like, you know, like...

892
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,960
Yeah, it's crazy that Henya kept attacking you.

893
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,720
Why did you do that, Henya?

894
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,020
Wait, what?

895
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,960
Why were you attacking Mint?

896
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,300
No, no, no.

897
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,520
You gotta get good.

898
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,740
Not blaming on me.

899
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,500
All right.

900
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,060
Let's try this again.

901
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,580
Let's try this.

902
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,360
Just get good.

903
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,940
Stick together.

904
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,940
I am good.

905
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,480
I am great, actually.

906
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:31,980
I am the one beside the fire.

907
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,560
Greatest of all time, as they say.

908
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,220
I remember their friendly fire.

909
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:35,760
I can't remember.

910
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,580
They say that they...

911
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,820
Same thing about me and Mango, actually.

912
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,740
Mango?

913
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,880
Yeah.

914
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,420
He's a Smash player.

915
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,840
Oh, I can't...

916
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,400
And Drinker.

917
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,480
He's a competitive Smash player and Drinker.

918
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,020
He does both.

919
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,760
She's good to go.

920
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,720
Get ready.

921
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,320
I don't want to get a melee weapon.

922
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,600
I don't want to get a melee weapon.

923
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,520
Also, girls, there's drugs on the bed if you guys want some.

924
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,280
Otherwise, I'm going to do all of them.

925
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,880
Yeah.

926
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,020
Get away.

927
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,800
Yeah.

928
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,460
Oh, shit.

929
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,740
Uh-oh.

930
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,000
Uh-oh.

931
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,960
Watch out.

932
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,180
Watch out.

933
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,600
I'm coming.

934
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:08,900
I'm coming.

935
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,120
I'm coming.

936
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
It exploded on me.

937
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,720
I can't see anything.

938
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Oh, I'm icky.

939
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,880
Freaking boomers.

940
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,660
Oh, I'm icky.

941
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,340
I'm icky.

942
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,780
I'm blind and icky.

943
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,140
I see Garci.

944
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,180
Guys.

945
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,720
I think the whole...

946
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,220
I think the horde is coming.

947
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,900
Are they?

948
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,620
No, we're fine.

949
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,180
We're all good.

950
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,940
I don't know how to tell you all this.

951
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,360
Yeah, we're fine.

952
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,440
I think the horde is coming.

953
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,120
Reload.

954
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,340
Okay, fine.

955
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,100
Just watch this.

956
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,340
All right.

957
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,820
When in doubt, more drugs.

958
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,320
Where's anything?

959
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,580
You better watch out.

960
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,260
You better watch out.

961
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
You better watch out.

962
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,360
You better watch out.

963
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,560
You better watch out.

964
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,040
You better watch out.

965
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,180
You better watch out.

966
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,460
Is there anything down here?

967
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,840
No.

968
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:45,960
No.

969
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:46,760
No.

970
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,240
No.

971
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,540
No.

972
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:47,920
No.

973
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,740
Nobody knows what underwear they like.

974
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,700
Lana.

975
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,780
Buy it with your money.

976
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,580
Wait.

977
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,260
Can I not hit him?

978
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,920
Oh, the bat is a little bit weaker.

979
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,680
Oh, my gosh.

980
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,320
Oh, I got a defibrillator in case one of you girlies dies.

981
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:19,680
Oh, my gosh.

982
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,560
Oh, you dropped your health kit though, so...

983
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,940
Yeah, I'm gonna use it now and then I'm gonna drop the defibrillator.

984
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,400
Oh, there's a pipe bomb.

985
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,020
How does he want to take it?

986
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,380
Ah!

987
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,560
Ah!

988
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,220
Ah!

989
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,460
Ah!

990
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,360
It's okay.

991
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,780
I just picked up the defibrillator for this exact issue.

992
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,260
Thank you.

993
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,520
Thank you.

994
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,980
I got you.

995
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,240
Thank you, Haru.

996
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,060
You better watch out.

997
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,460
You better watch out.

998
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,980
Teamwork.

999
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,540
Teamwork.

1000
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,480
Tanya is gonna steal your waifu.

1001
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,000
So that pipe bomb is actually a TMT Minecraft block for me.

1002
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,940
Get the fuck back.

1003
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,500
Get the fuck back.

1004
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,980
Get the fuck back.

1005
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
Don't shoot teammates.

1006
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm not trying to.

1007
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,680
Get out of my way.

1008
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,040
Oh, shit.

1009
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,580
You better watch out.

1010
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:55,940
What's this?

1011
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,660
Pills?

1012
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,220
Uh-oh.

1013
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,460
Oh, shit.

1014
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,740
For me, that's the Torah.

1015
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,600
Help me.

1016
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,080
Help me.

1017
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,880
Here we go.

1018
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,180
I got you.

1019
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,440
Thank you, Tanya.

1020
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,440
My angel.

1021
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,600
I shot him too.

1022
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,660
Tanya, my love.

1023
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,280
My angel.

1024
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,200
No, I didn't.

1025
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,300
My favorite small woman.

1026
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,280
Anytime.

1027
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:10,920
Anytime.

1028
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,100
I don't know whether there's a small woman I love than you.

1029
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,100
So that's what I saw.

1030
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,400
Reloading.

1031
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,120
Uh-oh.

1032
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,900
The fire is spreading.

1033
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,420
Watch out.

1034
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, shit.

1035
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:20,920
Smoker.

1036
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,160
Smoker.

1037
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm here.

1038
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:21,780
I'm here.

1039
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,360
Oh, thank you.

1040
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,260
Fuck you.

1041
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,500
Get off my motorcycle.

1042
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,760
Ow, John.

1043
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,360
You better watch out.

1044
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,100
Oh, come on.

1045
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,160
Where?

1046
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,180
Where's the bullet?

1047
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,080
Oh, my gosh.

1048
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,480
Oh, God.

1049
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:35,880
Watch out.

1050
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,360
More is coming.

1051
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,540
Oh, I can't see anything.

1052
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,720
I'm sorry if I shoot you.

1053
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,320
That's it.

1054
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,620
That's it.

1055
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,200
Is this a regular gameplay experience of this game?

1056
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:43,660
Oh, my goodness.

1057
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:43,840
Yeah.

1058
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,980
Pretty average.

1059
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,960
I can't see anything.

1060
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,500
People are puking.

1062
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,340
Yeah, pretty average.

1063
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,000
Drugs everywhere.

1064
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,160
Pretty average.

1065
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,080
If I say so myself.

1066
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,260
Oh, my God.

1067
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,180
What's a magnum pistol?

1068
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,520
Scared the heck out of me.

1069
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,980
It's a stronger pistol.

1070
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,340
It's a stronger pistol.

1071
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,640
Is it good?

1072
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,040
I got a banana.

1073
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,200
For me, it's a panana.

1074
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,840
Yeah.

1075
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,480
Panana.

1076
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,140
Banana.

1077
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,700
Panana.

1078
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,100
Panana.

1079
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,940
Better watch out.

1080
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,620
Toxic acid.

1081
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,380
Better watch out.

1082
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,480
Oh, we've got to keep going.

1083
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:13,860
Yeah.

1084
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,040
Okay.

1085
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,200
Okay.

1086
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,640
From here?

1087
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,140
Yeah, I think so.

1088
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,020
I think outside.

1089
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,740
Oh, sorry.

1090
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,100
I'm burning.

1091
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,260
Oh, oh.

1092
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,760
You got it?

1093
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah, I got it.

1094
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,580
Thank you.

1095
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,700
Thank you.

1096
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,340
You're welcome, Hanya.

1097
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,660
I provide.

1098
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,880
I provide.

1099
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,660
A room.

1100
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,720
Nothing in it.

1101
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,060
Min, saving your Kamiyoshi?

1102
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,140
Embarrassing.

1103
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,440
Um, I am slow to press.

1104
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1105
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,860
You're thinking about other women since you played that bunny garden game.

1106
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,080
That's true.

1107
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,120
Rin-chan is, you know...

1108
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,720
It's not easy, uh...

1109
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,200
Oh shit.

1110
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,480
Oh my god!

1111
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,540
Oh my god!

1112
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,140
He's on top of me!

1113
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,200
Oh, you got him?

1114
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,640
Oh!

1115
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,100
A pipe bomb!

1116
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,320
Oh, nice exploding the boomer.

1117
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,720
Good job.

1118
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:57,840
Oh.

1119
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,240
Yeah!

1120
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,100
Nice, nice!

1121
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,280
Good job.

1122
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,140
Over here, guys.

1123
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,880
Which way?

1124
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,160
This way?

1125
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Oh.

1126
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,640
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

1127
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,480
Come in!

1128
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,420
Okay, I played, like, the one round of this game.

1129
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,280
Is melee or, um...

1130
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,840
Zombie Apache.

1131
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,700
...weapons better?

1132
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,420
Shit, shit, shit.

1133
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,120
Depends on, I think, your playstyle, right?

1134
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:20,960
Hmm.

1135
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,360
But I think that axe is kind of...

1136
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,240
My name's Alice.

1137
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,360
Uh-oh, guys.

1138
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,180
I can't see well.

1139
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,220
I can't believe Amelia is saying that she's coach on my stream.

1140
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,980
Guys, I think we're gonna die.

1141
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,580
Oh!

1142
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:33,880
Oh!

1143
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,620
Guys, I think we're gonna die.

1144
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,020
Oh!

1145
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,340
Oh!

1146
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,340
What's happening?

1147
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,400
I don't know.

1148
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,360
Probably the door's open.

1149
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,400
Just hold it a little bit.

1150
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,300
Oh no.

1151
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,280
Uh-oh.

1152
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Horde's coming, guys.

1153
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,620
Watch out.

1154
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,100
Oh my god.

1155
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,840
Where are they?

1156
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,900
Behind you!

1157
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,780
Get out of here, Shrek!

1158
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,200
Challenge it!

1159
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,480
Oh my god!

1160
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,380
Oh my god!

1161
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,220
A monster!

1162
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,410
A monster!

1163
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:54,830
I'm gonna die.

1164
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,490
A monster!

1165
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,090
Take the monster!

1166
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,870
We won't die!

1167
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,550
We won't...

1168
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,330
No, I'm gonna die.

1169
00:35:59,550 --> 00:35:59,590
Oh my gosh.

1170
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,390
Oh, I can't see!

1171
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,090
I can't see it.

1172
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:03,830
Oh my gosh.

1173
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,530
Oh my gosh.

1174
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,110
Oh my gosh.

1175
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:05,690
Who is who?

1176
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,550
I don't know.

1177
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,170
Just shoot!

1178
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:07,970
Just shoot!

1179
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,630
Oh my god.

1180
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:09,970
Keep shooting.

1181
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,590
Keep shooting.

1182
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,070
Keep shooting!

1183
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,310
Uh-oh.

1184
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,350
Uh, you got it?

1185
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:15,630
Oh!

1186
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,550
There you go.

1187
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:17,870
There you go.

1188
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,530
Holy cow!

1189
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,250
Over here?

1190
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:20,550
Over here?

1191
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,790
I feel like the voices are not loud and then the game is so loud.

1192
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,450
Hold on, hold on.

1193
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,990
I can hear you, I can hear you, Mata.

1194
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,150
Oh, arigato.

1195
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,230
Hold on, hold on.

1196
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,390
Oh my god, they're all on fire!

1197
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,770
Arigato gozaimasu.

1198
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,830
Oh my god, Mick, your Kamiyoshi is healing me.

1199
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,090
Thank you, Hennia.

1200
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:47,670
A sweet kiss from a maiden has awoken my spirits.

1201
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,330
I'm gonna throw this bomb at you.

1202
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,350
I feel so awake after a sweet kiss from my love.

1203
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,550
Over here, guys.

1204
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,470
Thank you, Hennia, for the kiss.

1205
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,490
Oh my goodness.

1206
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,530
It meant it was the best kiss ever.

1207
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,630
Yeah, I bet.

1208
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,210
Oh my god!

1209
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,410
It was the worst time for me to reload.

1210
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,930
Oh my god.

1211
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,150
Oh my god.

1212
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,930
I can't see anything.

1213
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,810
I cannot see anything either.

1214
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,150
That's okay.

1215
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,730
Get over here.

1216
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,870
Oh, hey, get off of me.

1217
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,390
Uh oh.

1218
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:31,930
This way?

1219
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,610
Wait, this way?

1220
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,890
Oh my god, how do we play this?

1221
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,990
This is so stressful.

1222
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,430
I think it's this way, right?

1223
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,190
There's a meds over here.

1224
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:36,610
Yeah.

1225
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:36,770
Oh.

1226
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,150
It's over here.

1227
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:38,570
Hello.

1228
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,550
Oh, hello.

1229
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:40,970
There you go.

1230
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,690
Now we're here.

1231
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,250
Oh my god.

1232
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:42,930
Okay, we're outside.

1233
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,330
Finally.

1234
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,670
Going to pipe bomb.

1235
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,710
Pipe bomb.

1236
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,550
Pipe bomb.

1237
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,590
All right, guys, I'm going to throw a big bomb.

1238
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,010
Be careful.

1239
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,110
Oh, you already did.

1240
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:53,870
Never mind.

1241
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,450
You beat me to it.

1242
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,410
Oh.

1243
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,830
Never mind.

1244
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,350
She said...

1245
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,030
Oh my gosh.

1246
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,230
Over here, guys.

1247
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,050
She said I'm throwing a pipe bomb.

1248
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,070
The safe room.

1249
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,850
Wait, what is the vial?

1250
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,710
Safe room.

1251
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,250
Oh, come here.

1252
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,490
Come here.

1253
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,670
Safe room time.

1254
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,430
Here they come.

1255
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,420
What do you mean, here they come?

1256
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,180
What do you mean, here they come?

1257
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,540
Let's go.

1258
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
Good job, girls.

1259
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,380
Yippee.

1260
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:18,980
Yippee.

1261
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,340
Oh my gosh.

1262
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,700
Look at you, Melee Queen.

1263
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,260
I mean, listen.

1264
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,340
I do what I do when I do what I do.

1265
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,500
I do what I do.

1266
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,560
I'm the only one that kills people with a melee weapon.

1267
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,560
Yeah.

1268
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,320
We'll get better weapons soon, hopefully.

1269
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,160
Let's go.

1270
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,560
Yeah, I think I'm going to switch to melee back again.

1271
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,260
Switch to melee again.

1272
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,600
I think that's good.

1273
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,280
Also, let's heal, right?

1274
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,680
What is this?

1275
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,180
No, we can heal here, yeah.

1276
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,940
Yeah, yeah.

1277
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,420
I'll get the shot.

1278
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:46,980
I'll get the shot.

1279
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,480
Can we heal it?

1280
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,200
Yeah, I'm going to heal.

1281
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm going to heal.

1282
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm going to heal.

1283
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm going to carry a defibrillator just in case one of us dies.

1284
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,340
Oh, I already have...

1285
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,140
Sorry.

1286
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,340
There you go.

1287
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,220
You guys are healing.

1288
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,040
It does the California girl's dance for me.

1289
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,400
Yeah.

1290
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,700
Wait.

1291
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,780
Are you for real?

1292
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,000
Easy.

1293
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,580
Yeah.

1294
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,040
Is there no melee weapons here, by the way?

1295
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,280
No, there is.

1296
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,500
They're here.

1297
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,780
Do you guys see a melee weapon, by the way?

1298
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,320
So, this gun is a cat for me.

1299
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,520
Cat?

1300
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,080
Oh, you have the cat mod.

1301
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1302
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,500
Dude, yeah.

1303
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:18,920
Dude, yeah.

1304
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:18,940
Dude, yeah.

1305
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:19,900
It's a cat?

1306
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,340
It's a cat?

1307
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,160
So, what if I shoot it?

1308
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,520
Thank you, everybody.

1309
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,380
There's a heart.

1310
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,580
What?

1311
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,240
That's cute.

1312
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,080
What about this one?

1313
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,300
Wait.

1314
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,980
I don't see it.

1315
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,360
A shotgun.

1316
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:27,840
A shotgun.

1317
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,800
It's a regular shotgun.

1318
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,020
Oh, okay.

1319
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,340
Okay.

1320
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,360
I see from my side.

1321
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,560
That's cool.

1322
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,340
Oh, I should get the mods next time.

1323
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,180
I don't know if I should bring the shotgun or the can.

1324
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,280
They're really easy to use, too.

1325
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,940
Bring whatever you want.

1326
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,100
Oh, really?

1327
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,640
Yeah.

1328
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,660
It's really easy, too.

1329
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,240
I'm going to bring the shotty.

1330
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeah.

1331
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,080
I got a shotgun, too.

1332
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,280
Ready?

1333
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:46,660
Oh.

1334
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,660
Yeah.

1335
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:49,960
Ready?

1336
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,160
Oh.

1337
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh, my God.

1338
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,540
Hello?

1339
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,180
Oh.

1340
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,640
Oh, shit.

1341
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm ready, bitch.

1342
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,700
Oh, sorry.

1343
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:01,940
What's up?

1344
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,340
Oh, my God.

1345
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,360
Please.

1346
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,940
I'm always missing like an inch or two.

1347
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,060
I feel like I keep thinking that I'm just like an inch or two longer than I really am.

1348
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:13,900
Jeez.

1349
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,220
Get off of me.

1350
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,080
I hate that.

1351
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,300
Does that ever happen to anybody else?

1352
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,340
What is it?

1353
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,500
So now your primary gun will have ammo.

1354
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,040
I keep thinking I'm a little longer than I am.

1355
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,760
But your pistol won't have ammo.

1356
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,480
You're pretty long on my screen.

1357
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,520
Oh, watch out for it.

1358
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,260
Am I a little longer?

1359
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:32,740
Oh, my God.

1360
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:32,900
How do I kill it?

1361
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,300
Ow.

1362
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,260
Oh, my God.

1363
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,520
Please.

1364
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,160
Oh, shit.

1365
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,260
I'm reloading.

1366
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm sorry.

1367
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,580
Oh, shit.

1368
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,000
I need help.

1369
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,420
I need help.

1370
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,060
I need help.

1371
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:40,740
Fuck.

1372
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,720
Get it off of me.

1373
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,880
Oh, my God.

1374
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,060
Thank you, Haruka.

1375
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,660
My queen.

1376
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,700
All right.

1377
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,080
So your primary gun will have ammo, but your secondary gun, like your pistol, will have infinite ammo.

1378
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,660
What do you want to do?

1379
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't want to go.

1380
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,240
Oh, my gosh.

1381
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,400
Oh, my God.

1382
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,020
This is so jarring, this gameplay.

1383
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,780
Why so?

1384
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,200
It's like shaking.

1385
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,240
What is this?

1386
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,900
My whole screen.

1387
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,640
Is there something over here?

1388
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:05,880
No?

1389
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,140
Am I going crazy?

1390
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,760
Thank you for playing this with me.

1391
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,620
I am having the time of my life.

1392
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,340
It's a little crazy.

1393
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,880
It is.

1394
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,580
It's fun.

1395
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:14,840
It's fun.

1396
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,520
It's a little jarring.

1397
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:15,880
Oh, yeah.

1398
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,420
But it's fun.

1399
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,700
Oh, there's a grenade launcher here if anyone wants it.

1400
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:19,940
Oh.

1401
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,060
Oh.

1402
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,260
Little grenade.

1403
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,640
Oh, thank you, somebody.

1404
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,100
Thank you.

1405
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,280
Thank you.

1406
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,640
Not me.

1407
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,880
All right.

1408
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,680
I can't wait to bring out this Pepsi gun.

1409
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,460
Pepsi gun.

1410
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,020
The craziest thing is like how much the game shakes when you're trying to do anything.

1411
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,940
It's just so fast.

1412
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,620
It is very.

1413
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,380
It's a super fast, fast paced game.

1414
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,480
Feels like so fast.

1415
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah.

1416
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,660
Which way do we go?

1417
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,040
It's like ikuzo, ikuzo.

1418
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,660
Here?

1419
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,500
I heard a crying.

1420
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:44,940
I don't know.

1421
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,480
Oh, no.

1422
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:45,920
That's a witch.

1423
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,380
Shoot her.

1424
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,720
Shoot her.

1425
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,120
Uh-oh.

1426
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,600
Start over.

1427
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:47,900
Ah!

1428
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,820
We don't want to disturb the witch.

1429
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,780
Oh.

1430
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,680
I'm trying to kill her.

1431
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:55,980
Oh, my God.

1432
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,860
Oh, you got her.

1433
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,280
I got her.

1434
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:57,820
Oh, sorry.

1435
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
I didn't realize that.

1436
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,280
My turn.

1437
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,800
So, the witch, if you wake her up, she'll scream and alert every single zombie around.

1438
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,340
Yeah.

1439
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,660
It's kind of not great.

1440
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,600
So, she's very interesting.

1441
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,420
Oh, zombie around too.

1442
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,880
Apologize, but I've also never played this before.

1443
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,120
Here, hold on.

1444
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,160
Oh, gosh.

1445
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:12,700
Wait.

1446
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,060
Did you kill him?

1447
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,720
Here, hold on.

1448
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,200
My turn.

1449
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,880
My turn.

1450
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,400
Let me heal you.

1451
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:15,960
Let me heal you.

1452
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,440
Let me heal you.

1453
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,480
Yeah.

1454
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:16,680
Please.

1455
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:16,880
Please.

1456
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,000
Please.

1457
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,060
I'm here to let you know what every zombie does.

1458
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,040
My maid.

1459
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,860
Can I get a moe moe cue?

1460
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,760
Oh, my gosh.

1461
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,440
It's so funny.

1462
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,340
My thing is...

1463
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:26,760
Wow.

1464
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:27,760
Komugi.

1465
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,140
Yeah.

1466
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,800
Don't worry about it.

1467
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm here to tell you what zombie does what I think.

1468
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:31,920
Wait.

1469
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,080
Let go.

1470
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,880
Oh, my God.

1471
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,200
This is better.

1472
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,460
We're getting it.

1473
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,660
Nice.

1474
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,040
Didn't even moe moe cue me while she healed me.

1475
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,340
What?

1476
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:37,900
Ow.

1477
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,700
It's time for the owl.

1478
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,580
Unbelievable.

1479
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,940
Are you okay, Hanya?

1480
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:43,680
Oh, no.

1481
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,460
We need more help.

1482
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,840
I think we have to go down here.

1483
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,200
Okay.

1484
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,920
We'll get more help.

1485
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,360
I'm going to go down here.

1486
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,860
The hat is so tall.

1487
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,820
Haruka, you're Doug Dimadome with a really huge hat.

1488
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,800
Oh, sorry.

1489
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,740
Doug Dimadome.

1490
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:56,840
Doug Dimadome.

1491
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,300
Dimadome.

1492
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,120
Oh, my gosh.

1493
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,640
Did I last time with this hat on?

1494
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah.

1495
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,180
You got a really tall hat on.

1496
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,620
Oh, my God.

1497
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,560
I'm not hitting anyone.

1498
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,560
Oh, I got to heal myself.

1499
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,160
Oh, my gosh.

1500
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,140
My aim.

1501
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,820
Oh, hunter.

1502
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,020
Hunter.

1503
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,320
Oh, sorry.

1504
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,020
You guys got this.

1505
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,800
He's like done.

1506
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:16,980
You guys got this.

1507
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,220
Thank you.

1508
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,440
Thank you.

1509
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,160
What is this?

1510
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,200
Oh, what is this?

1511
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:24,620
Pills?

1512
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,660
I got pills here.

1513
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,220
Pills here.

1514
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,440
No, that's a grenade.

1515
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,520
So, the bio will damage the enemies, right?

1516
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,260
Yeah, I'm hitting my teemo if I throw it.

1517
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,500
Hold on, I want to...

1518
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,260
Oh, yeah.

1519
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,240
Well, I think they...

1520
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,220
No, they gather to it.

1521
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,040
So, they all like...

1522
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,420
Oh, perfect.

1523
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,740
So, it's easier to...

1524
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,440
Oh, nice.

1525
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,880
How do you got...

1526
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,000
Oh.

1527
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,100
Oh, my gosh.

1528
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,720
Yeah, they really...

1529
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,180
So, it's like...

1530
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,600
They're coming from the trees.

1531
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:46,960
I'm coming from the trees.

1532
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,900
This is going to be really loud!

1533
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,880
It came from above!

1534
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,300
Oh my god, a chainsaw?

1535
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:52,860
Where?

1536
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,280
Right here, right here!

1537
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,520
It can have it.

1538
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,140
It has gas though, I'm pretty sure.

1539
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,520
Gas, gas, gas!

1540
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,940
I'm gonna step on the gas!

1541
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1542
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,640
I'm gonna step on the gas!

1543
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,380
Do you like...

1544
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,460
my car?

1545
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,280
Shit guys, behind, behind, behind!

1546
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,680
You got it!

1547
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,580
You got it!

1548
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,360
I'm hearing a toad nearby.

1549
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,120
What's that?

1550
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,200
There's a guy here.

1551
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,000
They come from everywhere.

1552
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,140
Where do we go?

1553
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:40,700
Oh, up here?

1554
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,040
Listen, mothers need love too, sometimes.

1555
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,480
Oh my goodness.

1556
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,640
Wait, how did I get pushed off?

1557
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,580
No

1558
00:44:59,520 --> 00:44:59,980
worries!

1559
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,260
Meanwhile, getting eaten by a zombie?

1560
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,100
Are you okay?

1561
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,620
I'm okay.

1562
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,960
Are you okay?

1563
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,160
Are you okay?

1564
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,940
Oh, don't blow that up.

1565
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:12,780
Okay, wait, wait.

1566
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,480
What if I open it and then I throw that in?

1567
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,800
Oh, I hear something.

1568
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,340
I hear something icky.

1569
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,900
I hear something.

1570
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,940
Oh gosh!

1571
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,840
I can't see anything!

1572
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,260
Oh my gosh.

1573
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,240
Oh, oopsies.

1574
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:27,740
Yay!

1575
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,040
I can't see!

1576
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,060
Oh no!

1577
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,940
Up these stairs.

1578
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,740
Up the stairs?

1579
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,120
Okay.

1580
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,020
I got a pipe bomb.

1581
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:36,980
Okay.

1582
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,280
Careful.

1583
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,040
Oh, pipe bomb, pipe bomb, pipe bomb.

1584
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:42,860
Watch out.

1585
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,240
Good job.

1586
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,580
Oh, it's all on fire though.

1587
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,620
Here, you go.

1588
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,140
It'll pass.

1589
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,560
You go.

1590
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,600
You go, Matara.

1591
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:51,960
You go.

1592
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,760
You go.

1593
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,020
Yeah, you go.

1594
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,360
Give me fire!

1595
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,860
Ammo!

1596
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,140
What is this?

1597
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,720
Pills here.

1598
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,840
Is this a shotgun?

1599
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:07,880
What's this one?

1600
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,820
Oh, sniper!

1601
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,660
Sniper.

1602
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,880
My beloved.

1603
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,280
I have some ammo on my hand as well if you need.

1604
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,680
Oh, shit.

1605
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,220
Watch out.

1606
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:20,660
Watch out.

1607
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,900
The spitter is...

1608
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,580
Gross.

1609
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,440
I need help.

1610
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,560
Please.

1611
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,860
My aim.

1612
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,400
Oh my god.

1613
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,120
Yikes.

1614
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:34,740
Arigato.

1615
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,000
God, I love my little gun.

1616
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,500
The little gun that could, you know?

1617
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,660
Do we go down or do we go up?

1618
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,100
I think we go down.

1619
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,620
We go down?

1620
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,000
Okay.

1621
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,600
The little gun that could, you know?

1622
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,100
I hear something icky.

1623
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,380
Wait, wait.

1624
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,720
There's fall damage, by the way.

1625
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:55,620
Do not do what I just did.

1626
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,700
Oh, there's fall damage?

1627
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,120
No way.

1628
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,720
Oh, I didn't know there was fall damage.

1629
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,880
Oh, there's a little blower?

1630
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,700
Over here, guys.

1631
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,760
A little blower.

1632
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,160
Well, he like blows bile, you know?

1633
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:06,660
Yeah.

1634
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,380
Biohazardo.

1635
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:10,620
Whoa.

1636
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,040
Look at you guys.

1637
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,460
I'm hearing Peter Griffin.

1638
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,100
I think the boomer is nearby.

1639
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,200
Peter Griffin?

1640
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,260
Peter Griffin?

1641
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,220
Wait, we gotta go up, I think, right?

1642
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,200
Okay, stop saying the boomer, okay?

1643
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,100
I'm old, I know, but I'm really offended.

1644
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,220
I can't see it.

1645
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,260
Please stop saying the boomer.

1646
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,600
I can't see it.

1647
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,980
A Molotov?

1648
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,700
Oh, sorry.

1649
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,700
Don't shoot teammates.

1650
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,500
Where was that teammate?

1651
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,140
Oh, fuck.

1652
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,660
Sorry, I just shot a teammate.

1653
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,560
I'm sorry.

1654
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,600
I'm sorry.

1655
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,540
I'm stuck.

1656
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,740
Oh, ouch.

1657
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,940
Oh my goodness.

1658
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,480
Like a little rag doll.

1659
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,100
Maybe the sniper is not so great.

1660
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,040
This team is so fast.

1661
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,960
Maybe the sniper is not so great.

1662
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,900
I gotta be far away, though.

1663
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,960
Girls, how come there's like no medkits anywhere?

1664
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,460
Oh, you say?

1665
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,020
There's a toad nearby.

1666
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,260
There's a toad nearby.

1667
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,560
I'm hearing a guy who hugs your face.

1668
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,440
I'm hearing a guy who hugs your face.

1669
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,540
I got you!

1670
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,160
I got you!

1671
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,860
Jockey!

1672
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,440
I thought you said toad from Mario.

1673
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,700
I thought you said toad from Mario.

1674
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,580
The jockey is toad for me.

1675
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,500
Hold on, girls.

1676
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,720
I got a little Molotov cocktail for our enemies.

1677
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,360
There's another one in the room if you girls want to throw another one, too.

1678
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,800
Oh, I got the Molotov.

1679
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,420
Oh.

1680
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,020
Oh, that was a little...

1681
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,200
Hold on, let me get the other...

1682
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,680
Shut up.

1683
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,660
Let me get another Molotov.

1684
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,060
Oh!

1685
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,140
Oh, Chaja!

1686
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,500
Oh, you killed it with the fire!

1687
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,680
You killed it with the fire!

1688
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,760
So, whoever was saying I was anticlimactic, huh?

1689
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,160
I was fully climatic.

1690
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,120
That was actually pretty good.

1691
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,620
I actually hit the climax.

1692
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,160
Oh my god!

1693
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,620
Oh my god!

1694
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,340
Oh my god!

1695
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,700
Oh, what the hell was that?

1696
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, oh my god!

1697
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,440
I'm slowly dying, by the way, Hina.

1698
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,740
Are you okay?

1699
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,440
You guys are okay?

1700
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,540
Hina's behind us!

1701
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,580
I did it!

1702
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:26,880
I did it!

1703
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,620
Why did you set us on fire?

1704
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,460
Oh my god!

1705
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,340
Why did you set us on fire?

1706
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,440
Fire!

1707
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,200
Why did you set us on fire?

1708
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,300
Okay, I'm coming.

1709
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:42,840
Did I give you adrenaline?

1710
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,260
Into the ring of fire!

1711
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,040
I hate you so much!

1712
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,280
Down, down, down!

1713
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,600
Wait!

1714
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,140
I lost my molotov because of you!

1715
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,400
No way!

1716
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,860
No, you actually hit it on the enemy.

1717
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,460
You like hit it on the zombie.

1718
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,700
I didn't use it.

1719
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,900
Wait, wait, I'll heal you.

1720
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,360
I'll heal you, Mint.

1721
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,100
I'll heal you.

1722
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,440
Mint also has one.

1723
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:05,880
There's a bunch.

1724
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,620
I'll give you one.

1725
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,300
I'll give you mine.

1726
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,400
Hina, you also need one.

1727
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,080
I want to heal myself.

1728
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,740
I'll hold on.

1729
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,880
Alright everybody, I need your help.

1730
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,780
Oh wait, Hina, I got you.

1731
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,760
Oh, I'm sorry!

1732
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,980
What the fuck, bitch!

1733
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,540
Come here!

1734
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,020
No, come here, come here!

1735
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,120
Hold on, hold on, girls.

1736
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,700
I need Chad's help for a good gun.

1737
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,740
Is this the AK-47?

1738
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,700
What's a good gun?

1739
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,700
What's this one?

1740
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,400
Laser sight.

1741
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,060
Okay, perfect.

1742
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,960
This gun at the end here...

1743
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,480
Oh, AK rifle with the laser sight is really good.

1744
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,980
I don't know what this one is, but I'll take it.

1745
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,200
Oh, this is ammo.

1746
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:47,600
Ammo.

1747
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Which one's the AK?

1748
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,040
This one, this one at the end.

1749
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,380
Thank you, everybody.

1750
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,240
Okay, I'm gonna get a combat shotgun.

1751
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,780
Also, is the golf club good?

1752
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,200
Or...

1753
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,340
Should I switch to the...

1754
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,320
I like my grenade launcher so far.

1755
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:05,880
I'll keep it.

1756
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,240
I like shotgun.

1757
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,580
I want this.

1758
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,160
There we go.

1759
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:19,500
I won't let you through the barricade until I get you.

1760
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,260
What does he want?

1761
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,360
Oh, the snacks.

1762
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,460
I want the snacks too.

1763
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,340
Corn?

1764
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,640
We gotta go to the store and get some snacks for this guy.

1765
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,340
Yay, corn!

1766
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,020
I love corn.

1767
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,300
Wow, she really is your Kamioshi.

1768
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,680
Let's get corn!

1769
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,380
How much myth do you love?

1770
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,380
Okay, wait.

1771
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,200
Where are they coming from?

1772
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,960
From the store?

1773
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:44,320
Everywhere.

1774
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:44,900
Everywhere.

1775
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,560
Uh oh.

1776
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:48,900
Oh.

1777
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:50,980
Grenade?

1778
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,300
Where?

1779
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,220
I got it!

1780
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:52,560
I got it!

1781
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,800
Oh my god.

1782
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:56,740
Yeah, I'm coming.

1783
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,020
I'm coming.

1784
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,440
Oh my god.

1785
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:58,900
Ah!

1786
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,160
I'm on a jockey!

1787
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,100
Jockey!

1788
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,720
Help me!

1789
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,040
Thanks, I guess.

1790
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:08,740
Oh.

1791
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:10,420
Oh.

1792
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,980
We have to bring the cola back to the gun owner.

1793
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:14,880
Oh.

1794
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,320
Oh.

1795
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:15,800
Ah!

1796
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:24,830
I got you.

1797
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,910
Arigato.

1798
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:27,590
I got you.

1799
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:28,550
Wah!

1800
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,250
Got the cola.

1801
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:32,510
I got the cola.

1802
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,150
Protect the princess!

1803
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,190
Protect the princess!

1804
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,090
Oh my god.

1805
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,100
Haruka, are you okay?

1806
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,320
Oh my god.

1807
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,080
I should be fine, yeah.

1808
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,720
Oh my god.

1809
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,600
Oh,

1810
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,260
sorry.

1811
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,220
I had a guy overshot you.

1812
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,240
I have no idea what's going on, by the way.

1813
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,240
Sorry, I'm being quiet.

1814
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:06,640
Oh my god.

1815
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,040
I'm dying.

1816
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,600
I'm gonna help you up in just one minute.

1817
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:12,880
I got you.

1818
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,680
I got you.

1819
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,000
Matara!

1820
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:15,400
Matara!

1821
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,660
Kill the guy that's...

1822
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,100
Okay, thank you.

1823
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:18,580
Okay.

1824
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,580
Better watch out.

1825
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,840
Better watch out.

1826
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,420
You better watch out.

1827
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,500
I'm gonna throw him up.

1828
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,980
I think I drank him.

1829
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,800
Where did I go?

1830
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,450
Did you drink the cola?

1831
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:37,850
I drank him.

1832
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,110
We have to help Hanya.

1833
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:40,950
We have to save Hanya.

1834
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,350
Hanya!

1835
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:41,630
Oh!

1836
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,110
What are you being dragged by?

1837
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:43,350
I don't see him.

1838
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,070
I don't see him.

1839
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,130
Where is the smoker?

1840
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:46,670
Oh, he's up here.

1841
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,210
He's on the roof.

1842
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:47,850
He's on the roof.

1843
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:48,850
He's on the roof.

1844
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,830
I'm gonna die.

1845
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:50,710
I got him.

1846
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:52,910
Someone got him.

1847
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,390
What the hell was that?

1848
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,010
Thank you.

1849
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:55,870
Arigato.

1850
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,430
I'm going into the store to see if there's anything to find, okay?

1851
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:00,670
I'm going into the store to see if there's anything to find, okay?

1852
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,890
No, we have to deliver the cola.

1853
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,950
Yeah, we gotta deliver the coke.

1854
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,370
Was there nothing in the store else?

1855
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,490
You can shoot the tongue too?

1856
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,050
Oh, okay.

1857
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,210
Thank you.

1858
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:09,530
Thank you.

1859
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,810
I like how people are saying shoot the tongue.

1860
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,430
I've never played the game before, y'all.

1861
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,550
I have no idea what to do.

1862
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:17,330
But I'm doing my best.

1863
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:17,370
I'm coming!

1864
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,010
Doing my darn best.

1865
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:21,350
I got the cola!

1866
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,830
I got the cola!

1867
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:22,830
I got the cola!

1868
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:23,810
Going!

1869
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:24,670
Going!

1870
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:25,210
I

1871
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,140
throw the bomb.

1872
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:31,700
I'm throwing the bomb.

1873
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,140
Where's the cola?

1874
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,480
Careful, girls.

1875
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,620
I'm still here!

1876
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,200
What the fuck!

1877
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,000
Take the cola!

1878
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,100
Take the cola!

1879
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,200
But I saved you, didn't I?

1880
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,040
No!

1881
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,500
I mean, you did, but no!

1882
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,660
But I saved you, didn't I?

1883
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,700
But I helped, didn't I?

1884
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,020
But you're alive, aren't you?

1885
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,020
Woah, what just happened?

1886
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,880
You're alive, aren't you?

1887
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,660
I've played this so many times now, I can't even remember what's going on.

1888
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:56,840
Have you really?

1889
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,220
I thought you'd be a little bit better.

1890
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,040
Oh my god!

1891
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:02,420
Oh!

1892
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,520
Why did I jump into the...

1893
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,140
Help me!

1894
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,040
My point's sad!

1895
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,920
I wanted to feel alive!

1896
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,520
Okay!

1897
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,780
I wanted to feel this!

1898
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,180
Absolutely sad.

1899
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,120
I said what I said.

1900
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:16,800
We're all done.

1901
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,180
Okay, I haven't played this in like three years, though.

1902
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,000
So you have to give me like a little bit of a...

1903
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,660
Actually, no.

1904
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,440
It's been less than that.

1905
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:25,960
Just kidding.

1906
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,120
There's not enough health packs in this game, y'all.

1907
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,400
Oh, here's the ammo.

1908
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,360
We need more health packs.

1909
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:38,920
I'm dying.

1910
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,100
That's the...

1911
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,760
That's the Left 4 Dead feeling.

1912
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,500
I am like shocked to play this game.

1913
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,980
Always feeling like you're dying.

1914
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,320
Watch out!

1915
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:52,820
There's a...

1916
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,620
Did I get the spitter?

1917
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,340
I got the spitter.

1918
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,540
It's her.

1919
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,920
I think we have to go back.

1920
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,540
I can't remember.

1921
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,940
Sorry, I just shot you.

1922
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,380
Did you shoot me?

1923
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,040
Girl, I'm gonna die!

1924
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,220
We're all so close to death, actually.

1925
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,140
It's not quite...

1926
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:09,880
Oh, we're going backwards?

1927
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,760
Oh, we're going backwards.

1928
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,480
Oh, okay.

1929
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,760
It's actually concerning how close we are to death.

1930
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,160
All four of us.

1931
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,740
Honestly, me every day.

1932
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,500
Me every day.

1933
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:22,580
Me every day.

1934
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,080
I can't even run.

1935
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:24,980
It's me.

1936
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,540
It's my tummy.

1937
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,080
It's grumbling.

1938
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,360
Can we go in?

1939
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,560
Let us in.

1940
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,860
Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys!

1941
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:34,960
Help me, help me!

1942
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,440
Back, back, back!

1943
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,900
You got him.

1944
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,940
Oh, we're going back to the market?

1945
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,880
The market?

1946
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,680
What am I hearing?

1947
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,560
Oh, ouch.

1948
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,300
Nice.

1949
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,440
Am I missing these, like, point-blank shots?

1950
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,340
What's going on?

1951
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,580
What's wrong with ours?

1952
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,940
Your age is slowing you down?

1953
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,680
I think so, yeah.

1954
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,340
Oh my gosh, I can't even...

1955
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,640
I can't even run.

1956
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,880
I'm so slow.

1957
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,460
I only have one HP left.

1958
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:07,940
Me too.

1959
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,220
Yeah, we're all, like, right about to die.

1960
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:11,580
Yeah.

1961
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,140
We're having a shot.

1962
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:16,780
Uh...

1963
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,660
It's over.

1964
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,280
Oh, wait.

1965
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,180
I have a health kit.

1966
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,100
No, I don't have a health kit.

1967
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,700
No, no, no, I don't, I don't, I don't.

1968
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,460
I thought I did.

1969
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:26,800
My bad.

1970
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,340
Jockey!

1971
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:30,820
It's gone.

1972
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,460
Sorry, it's because I saw the...

1973
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,920
Yeah, I don't have a health kit.

1974
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,680
My bad.

1975
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,660
You're bad.

1976
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,840
Wait, where do we go, you guys?

1977
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:42,880
Haru, we're coming?

1978
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,260
We're on normal difficulty.

1979
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,100
If anyone's wondering.

1980
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,560
If anyone's normal.

1981
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,000
If anyone's normal.

1982
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,380
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

1983
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm going to die.

1984
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,440
I got you, I got you, I'm right here.

1985
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:55,820
No!

1986
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,560
Come here, princess.

1987
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,100
Get up.

1988
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,800
One kiss from your true love.

1989
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,380
I guess I wasn't your true love because you have, like, 4 HP.

1990
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,380
I think we go over here.

1991
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,020
This way.

1992
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,300
Oh!

1993
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,000
Okay, okay.

1994
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,340
Are we going to make it?

1995
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,160
Of course we're going to make it.

1996
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,380
We're going to die another day.

1997
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,880
As Madonna once said.

1998
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,600
I'm going to die another day.

1999
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,960
I'm going to die.

2000
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,520
I died.

2001
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,100
What?

2002
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,000
I need a thought.

2003
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:29,540
Okay.

2004
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,180
Am I the one growling?

2005
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,600
Is it you?

2006
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:34,500
Are you growling?

2007
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,340
I don't know, there's like somebody growling.

2008
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,720
It's kind of sexy.

2009
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,360
I don't know.

2010
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,380
If it's you growling, it's definitely not sexy.

2011
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,080
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2012
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,120
Hey, shut up.

2013
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,540
Thanos?

2014
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,280
Oh, fuck.

2015
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,320
Where?

2016
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,620
I think the boss is Thanos for me.

2017
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,780
And I'm hearing Thanos music.

2018
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,340
It's Metal Gear Ray!

2019
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,460
It's Metal Gear Ray for you?

2020
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm constricted.

2021
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,740
I'm dying right now.

2022
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,980
She's dying, she's dying.

2023
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,880
I'm dying.

2024
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:04,580
I'm dying.

2025
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,820
How am I not able to save you?

2026
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,220
Hold on.

2027
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,740
I am down.

2028
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,780
I saved you, I saved you.

2029
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,140
You're fine.

2030
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,860
No, I'm not.

2031
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,320
I'm dead.

2032
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,100
I'm shooting like some mini boss guy.

2033
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,560
I'm shooting like some mini boss guy.

2034
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,420
Oh my god.

2035
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,650
Hanya, are you okay?

2036
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,150
I'm dead.

2037
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:27,990
Yeah, me too.

2038
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:28,910
Where, where, where?

2039
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,830
I have a defibrillator.

2040
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,870
Go to the safe house and we'll be revived.

2041
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:36,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2042
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,150
Hold on, let's see if there's help here.

2043
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:39,790
You're close.

2044
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,110
We're close.

2045
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:41,850
Might as well just go.

2046
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:42,430
Yeah, just go.

2047
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,490
Hang in there.

2048
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,350
Go, just go.

2049
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:48,810
Just go.

2050
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,150
It's almost there, it's almost there.

2051
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:52,550
Okay.

2052
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:53,650
Look at that.

2053
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,110
I'm hearing toad.

2054
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:58,050
There's a spider right there.

2055
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:58,490
Nice.

2056
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:00,850
Watch out.

2057
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,470
Saw someone jump over.

2058
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:04,830
Nice.

2059
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,350
Is this the safe room?

2060
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,030
This is the safe room.

2061
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:07,650
Go, go, go, go, go.

2062
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,170
Oh, good job.

2063
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:10,850
Amazing.

2064
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:17,850
Let's go.

2065
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,690
What is this game?

2066
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,910
Left 4 Dead.

2067
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:25,010
Yeah, this is Left 4 Dead.

2068
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,350
I don't understand anything.

2069
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:28,170
Yeah.

2070
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:30,950
I think I'm too old.

2071
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:32,250
My brain, I'm like...

2072
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,890
I don't understand what's going on.

2073
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,410
It's a lot.

2074
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:38,370
It's a lot.

2075
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:39,710
It's fun.

2076
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,790
It is so fun though.

2077
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,070
It is really fun.

2078
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,290
I definitely could play this again.

2079
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,170
Wait, what's this one?

2080
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,910
Gotta be around here somewhere.

2081
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,350
This isn't one I had before.

2082
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,710
Somebody said I'm pointing and clicking on heads.

2083
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:53,330
I'm not.

2084
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,770
I'm just pointing towards where the zombie is, sort of.

2085
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,870
I don't think I'm clicking on any heads.

2086
01:00:59,150 --> 01:00:59,470
Sort of.

2087
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,290
Out of these three, what's the best one?

2088
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,170
What's this one?

2089
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,670
I'll get this one.

2090
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:06,590
Oh no, I lost my laser pointer.

2091
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:07,890
It looks very cute.

2092
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:08,650
Oh my god.

2093
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,770
Is that a scratch mark?

2094
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,570
Is that a scratch mark on your chest?

2095
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,930
Yeah, it is.

2096
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,510
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

2097
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,570
I got it from when I was a kid.

2098
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,630
I was playing Teletubbies and now I'm here.

2099
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,490
Mrs. Puff, get out of my way.

2100
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:26,330
The what?

2101
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,390
Teletubbies scratched me when I was a kid.

2102
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:28,910
Oh my god!

2103
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,130
Hold on for the door!

2104
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:31,330
Oh my god.

2105
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,790
Oh wait, I can use my pipe bomb.

2106
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,030
Wait, where did I pipe go?

2107
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:38,290
Oh no, I don't think we need to.

2108
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:39,210
There's not that many.

2109
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:42,930
Oh, maybe there is a lot.

2110
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,530
You can use your...

2111
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,130
No, we're right here though.

2112
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,070
Well, I remember this place.

2113
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:54,530
The scary thing about using a scope in this game is you can't see anything.

2114
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,310
Yeah, you can't really, you can't aim in this game.

2115
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,450
It's hard to use a scope in this, yeah.

2116
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:00,790
Cause it's too fast.

2117
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:02,890
How do, how do?

2118
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:03,790
Oh, you're fine, you're fine.

2119
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:07,010
Oh.

2120
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,730
I'm sorry I'm being kind of quiet.

2121
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:11,430
I really just have to focus.

2122
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,550
I can't see anything.

2123
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:13,870
It's okay, it's okay.

2124
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,230
I did it by accident.

2125
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,990
But you also deserved it, you bitch.

2126
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:18,770
What the?

2127
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,070
I'm gonna get you for that with this golf club.

2128
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,050
I challenge you.

2129
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,350
Punch me in the throat.

2130
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,750
Punch me like you mean it.

2131
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:29,770
I'm hearing Toad, I think he's nearby.

2132
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:30,790
Toad!

2133
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,710
Toad is the jockey for me.

2134
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,430
Oh yeah, jockey, jockey, jockey.

2135
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,290
Oh, that's a mannequin.

2136
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:38,830
Get the mannequin.

2137
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:41,350
Good job.

2138
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,510
Can I go back in the safe room and reload or is that cheesing?

2139
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,630
You can go, I think.

2140
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,450
Oh, spinner, spinner, spinner.

2141
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:48,210
Where?

2142
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,630
Oh, I see him, I see him, I see him!

2143
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:57,390
Cute girl is yelling.

2144
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,250
Oh my god, he's throwing.

2145
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,110
Ouch!

2146
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,790
I just made that shot.

2147
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,750
Why am I taking so long to reload?

2148
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:06,090
Hello?

2149
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:07,890
Might be the gun you have.

2150
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,370
Oh boy.

2151
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:10,650
Oh my god.

2152
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,070
He's down?

2153
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,030
I think I killed him.

2154
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:16,430
Is someone on me?

2155
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:16,970
No?

2156
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:17,890
Is someone shooting me?

2157
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,430
I'm so happy I have that as the Thanos.

2158
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,790
Because like, when that boss comes in, I'm hearing the Thanos theme.

2159
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,990
And he's just running around throwing shit.

2160
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:26,590
It's so epic.

2161
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,730
What is the Thanos theme?

2162
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:28,990
Revert to reload.

2163
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,830
I think it's also because I switched weapons, so it like restarted the reload animation.

2164
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:36,470
Little baby.

2165
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,930
I have Metal Gear Ray as the tank.

2166
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,490
Oh, you really?

2167
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,930
That's so funny as the tank.

2168
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:42,730
Nice.

2169
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:43,850
I'm the vanilla one.

2170
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,210
Metal Gear Ray, my beloved.

2171
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:46,470
I know, me too.

2172
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,910
Get the Molotov.

2173
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:51,250
For me, the spinner is Waluigi, which I thought was funny.

2174
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:56,610
And then the fucking, the Waluigi cart song plays when he arrives every time.

2175
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,310
That is funny.

2176
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,810
I have a pipe bomb.

2177
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:01,710
We can um...

2178
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,810
We can coordinate our pipe bombs and stuff, I think.

2179
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:06,930
Another one, another one.

2180
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,430
I need help, I need help.

2181
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:10,850
I'm reloading.

2182
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,030
I always reload at the worst time.

2183
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:15,330
Big guy, big boy.

2184
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,730
The charger is Shrek for me, which is funny.

2185
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,030
That is funny.

2186
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,870
Oh, they're coming, they're coming.

2187
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,570
I should get a mod, I should get a mod.

2188
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,850
Yeah, all you have to do is just subscribe.

2189
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,650
It's so easy.

2190
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:31,250
Is this like a workshop?

2191
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:32,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2192
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:34,510
It's so easy.

2193
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,370
It's so easy.

2194
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:38,990
Reloading.

2195
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,630
Reloading.

2196
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,630
So you're just murdering Teletubbies?

2197
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,050
I killed them.

2198
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,210
Oh, I hear a voice.

2199
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:01,290
I hear a sound.

2200
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,090
I hear a voice.

2201
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,230
Take your meds.

2202
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:10,310
Sorry, sorry, I'm hearing voices in my head.

2203
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:10,470
Sorry, sorry, I'm hearing voices in my head.

2204
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:10,950
Is it this way?

2205
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:11,890
I don't know actually.

2206
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,290
Replace your low ammo.

2207
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,070
Oh, it's fully loaded.

2208
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,630
It's here, it's here, it's here.

2209
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:19,070
Reloading.

2210
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,730
Oh, crying girls around.

2211
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,290
They just said.

2212
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:24,450
So there's a witch.

2213
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,670
So how does the witch work?

2214
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:32,170
I think you have to kill her before she gets alerted, right?

2215
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,630
Can you ignore it?

2216
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:37,750
I think you have to kill her before she gets alerted, or you have to sneak by.

2217
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,550
Yeah, you can sneak by.

2218
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:40,370
Yeah, you can sneak by.

2219
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,470
I don't hear her.

2220
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:43,670
I hear her.

2221
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:44,530
Yeah, I can hear her.

2222
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,530
But aren't the bullets going to alert her?

2223
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,250
Just sneak around the witch.

2224
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:50,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2225
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:53,350
I got him.

2226
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,310
Oh, ouch!

2227
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,750
Guys, I'm going to throw a pipe bomb.

2228
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,550
We are running in the middle of this bugger!

2229
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:03,510
Uh-oh.

2230
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,070
I got him.

2231
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:08,570
Nice, nice.

2232
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:09,550
Nice, nice.

2233
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:10,650
Thank you.

01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,090
Reloading.

2235
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:14,650
Reloading.

2236
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:16,490
If anybody sees ammo, let me know.

2237
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:17,690
Let's look around.

2238
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:22,050
Where is he?

2239
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,370
Is he here?

2240
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,310
I don't have a pistol.

2241
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,210
I have a katana.

2242
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,950
Do you want me to heal you?

2243
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,310
Please, I am dying.

2244
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:32,230
There's bathrooms and stuff.

2245
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,010
I'm going to check in them.

2246
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,170
Oh, guys, there's ammo here.

2247
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,590
There's ammo in the men's bathroom.

2248
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,070
Thank you, Mint.

2249
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,210
You're better than Rin-chan any day.

2250
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:40,850
Yippee!

2251
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,090
Ammo in the men's bathroom, girls, if you want.

2252
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:45,590
Men's bathroom?

2253
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,970
Yeah, men's bathroom ammo.

2254
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:47,690
The other one.

2255
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:48,470
The other men's bathroom.

2256
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:51,530
Is there no one in the ladies' restrooms?

2257
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,290
This one?

2258
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,590
I can't see in here.

2259
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:55,470
Ammo!

2260
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:57,650
Uh-oh.

2261
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:58,110
Uh-oh.

2262
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:58,630
Uh-oh.

2263
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,290
Uh-oh.

2264
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:00,630
I heard something.

2265
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:02,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2266
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:04,150
Big boy.

2267
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:07,490
Oh, sorry if I shot you.

2268
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,590
Happy season.

2269
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,530
Oh, my God.

2270
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:14,630
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

2271
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,670
The smoker is Ronald McDonald for me.

2272
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:18,450
Oh, is he?

2273
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:19,810
Hold on, hold on.

2274
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:22,210
Can we take like one second before we advance?

2275
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:25,130
Because my eyes in the dark with the light.

2276
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:25,750
Oh, my God.

2277
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,150
Are you okay?

2278
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,010
Are you okay?

2279
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,050
Are you okay, Mrs. Puff?

2280
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:30,190
She's old, you guys.

2281
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:31,250
I'm so old.

2282
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,610
Stop calling me Mrs. Puff.

2283
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,490
It's like taking me out, please.

2284
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,550
You have to stop.

2285
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,430
That's what you are.

2286
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:40,050
You're Mrs. Puff with the skinny legs.

2287
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,390
Oh, stop.

2288
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:41,810
What about me?

2289
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:42,490
What am I?

2290
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,470
You're Garfield.

2291
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,390
Oh, Garfield, the cat.

2292
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:47,050
Yeah.

2293
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,190
I still hear her.

2294
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:52,110
Here, come out of the darkness.

2295
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:52,870
Come out of the darkness.

2296
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,670
We got to go upstairs anyway, so.

2297
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,330
Okay.

2298
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,070
Oh, there's the witch.

2299
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,670
There's the witch.

2300
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:01,850
Oh, shit.

2301
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,810
Oh, no.

2302
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:04,990
I'm sorry.

2303
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:07,090
No.

2304
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:08,710
It's so weird.

2305
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:11,430
It's like right here at the elevator.

2306
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:13,690
Even at the elevator.

2307
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,990
I'm pinned.

2308
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:18,630
Oh, fuck.

2309
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,430
I also am pinned.

2310
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:20,330
I also am pinned.

2311
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:22,190
Help.

2312
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:25,750
I'm gonna die.

2313
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:26,910
I'm dead.

2314
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:28,830
I'm dead.

2315
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,230
I'm dead.

2316
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,770
I'm dead.

2317
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:31,050
I'm dead.

2318
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:31,930
I'm dead.

2319
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,190
No.

2320
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:40,450
No, no.

2321
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,810
How is this game on normal?

2322
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:44,670
It's so hard on normal.

2323
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,170
Please save me.

2324
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,310
We gotta go.

2325
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,610
Is there no health kit?

2326
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,190
Oh, health kit.

2327
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,970
Yeah, I think Mint or Haru should take it.

2328
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,110
You guys have less HP than me.

2329
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,130
I think Haru carries better than I do.

2330
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:58,090
Let me die.

2331
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:59,150
It's okay.

2332
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,310
Whatever you want.

2333
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:03,130
Haru, I'm not against you taking it.

2334
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:03,950
Look at her go.

2335
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:04,570
She's healing.

2336
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:05,490
She's healing.

2337
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:05,990
I can tell.

2338
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:09,190
Do you like my dance moves, Mint?

2339
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:12,190
Are you good?

2340
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,950
Are you okay?

2341
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:15,470
Oh my god.

2342
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,010
Oh, he was right behind me.

2343
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,470
??

2344
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,110
??

2345
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,570
??

2346
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:38,990
??

2347
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:39,610
??

2348
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:45,750
?

2349
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,990
??

2350
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,130
??

2351
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:48,930
??

2352
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:48,950
?

2353
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:48,970
??

2354
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:48,990
??

2355
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,010
Could you please keep singing?

2356
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:52,750
That is like such a big buff.

2357
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,150
I have first aid needed.

2358
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:56,390
Next knock down means death.

2359
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:57,910
Oh f**k.

2360
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,130
I'm dead dead dead.

2361
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:02,830
There might be healing kits here girls.

2362
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:04,310
Can you come with me real quick?

2363
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,130
There might be healing kits here.

2364
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:09,830
I can't see anything.

2365
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,850
Everything's black and white.

2366
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,110
I'm like a dog.

2367
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:13,410
Boomer has vomited?

2368
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,670
Oh there's a charger coming!

2369
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,350
I'll hide it behind you!

2370
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,330
Oh thank you.

2371
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:21,010
Oh sorry!

2372
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:22,810
Did I do that?

2373
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,310
It's okay.

2374
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,190
I had to help so don't worry.

2375
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:27,510
Did I do that?

2376
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,510
Hold on I got you.

2377
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,270
Behind us!

2378
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:35,730
Behind us!

2379
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,530
I got you.

2380
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,210
Behind us!

2381
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:08,690
Behind us!

2382
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,970
I'm dead, I'm dead.

2383
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:11,350
I'm dead!

2384
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:12,170
I'm so sorry!

2385
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:13,030
I'm dead.

2386
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:14,010
I got killed by Haruka!

2387
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,670
I'm so sorry.

2388
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,320
This is the worst

2389
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:55,410
game I've ever played.

2390
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,010
I'm struggling so much.

2391
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:01,070
You've just been laying here this whole time.

2392
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,990
I'm gonna check my music real quick.

2393
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:03,370
I'm back!

2394
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,270
Yay, I'm back!

2395
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,490
Guys, this was rough.

2396
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:08,590
This was rough.

2397
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,470
Yes, it was.

2398
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:11,810
Oh, I tried.

2399
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,110
That was hard, but I'm gonna try.

2400
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,150
Oh, man.

2401
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,470
That was crazy.

2402
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:20,830
You know what else is crazy?

2403
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,810
The rats in the room.

2404
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:23,890
Hey, man.

2405
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,290
Hey, man.

2406
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:29,570
I was crazy once.

2407
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:30,910
The rats.

2408
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,150
They locked me in a room.

2409
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:33,190
The rats.

2410
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:34,470
The rats made me crazy.

2411
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:35,730
Rats.

2412
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:36,230
Rats.

2413
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,890
Rats.

2414
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:37,710
Me and the rats.

2415
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:38,250
Rats.

2416
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:38,550
Rats.

2417
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:39,550
Me and the rats.

2418
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:40,090
Rats.

2419
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:40,530
Rats.

2420
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:40,830
Rats.

2421
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,410
Me and the rats.

2422
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:46,750
Let's clear some stuff out a little bit before we open the door this time.

2423
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,590
You guys are...

2424
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:51,550
Guys, there's a help kit missing, by the way, here.

2425
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,970
There's one more help kit if one of you wants to...

2426
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:54,810
Oh, I didn't grab it.

2427
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,470
I didn't grab it.

2428
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,010
It's fine.

2429
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,270
Grab it so we can, like, not...

2430
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:04,230
Let me reload my ammo.

2431
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,710

2522
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,880
Up the stairs!

2523
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,200
Come on, my squad!

2524
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,780
That's where we had to go.

2525
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,880
I'm going around people.

2526
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,320
Tinky!

2527
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,040
Where's the henna?

2528
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,740
Where's the henna?

2529
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,300
La la!

2530
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:09,800
Come on, henna protection squad.

2531
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,280
Oh, henna.

2532
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,820
Was there Teletubbies in Japan?

2533
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:13,900
No.

2534
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:17,840
I think... I never really watched it.

2535
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,300
I don't know, but I think...

2536
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,640
But it wasn't that popular, I guess.

2537
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:23,920
Really?

2538
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,540
I don't know.

2539
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,060
Maybe my chat in JP Bros knows about Teletubbies.

2540
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:30,820
I'm not sure.

2541
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,600
The JP Bros?

2542
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,100
I love that.

2543
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:32,900
The JP what?

2544
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,200
JP Bros.

2545
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,660
Like brothers?

2546
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:36,380
Yeah.

2547
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,560
I call them JP Bros.

2548
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:39,600
We go downstairs.

2549
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,240
JP Bro.

2550
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,440
Hold on, I'm going to throw a Molotov there.

2551
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,240
Okay.

2552
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,520
JP Bro.

2553
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,520
That's so funny.

2554
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,380
JP Bro.

2555
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,320
Or Teletubbies.

2556
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,560
Teletubbies.

2557
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,260
Help me!

2558
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,200
Help me!

2559
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,960
Help me!

2560
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,240
Help me!

2561
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,420
There's a snake in my boot.

2562
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:01,480
Oh my god.

2563
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,640
I have had it with these motherfucking snakes.

2564
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,400
On her motherfucking breast.

2565
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,340
There's a snake in my boot.

2566
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,100
Oh, you said boots.

2567
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,100
I thought you said breasts.

2568
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,180
I'm so sorry.

2569
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,320
Why would I say breasts?

2570
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:18,160
I genuinely was like, that is so weird that you said breasts.

2571
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,300
Why would I do that?

2572
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,600
I'm a yes and person.

2573
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,240
I'm an improv child.

2574
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,580
If that is what Mint decides to be, that is what Mint decides to be.

2575
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,520
I know it's a little late, you guys, but how is the audio?

2576
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,920
It might be a little late.

2577
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,320
Is that audio?

2578
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,480
Is it audio?

2579
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,460
Is that audio?

2580
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:42,820
Is it audio?

2581
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:43,120
Is it audio?

2582
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:43,600
Is it audience music?

2583
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:43,880
Is it audio?

2584
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,600
No, I get it.

2585
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,360
Thanos is back, guys.

2586
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:46,940
Uh oh.

2587
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:47,600
He's here.

2588
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,120
I hear him.

2589
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:48,500
I hear him.

2590
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,600
Oh my god.

2591
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,200
He's here, Brains.

2592
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:51,640
Ahhh!

2593
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,200
Oh my gosh.

2594
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,120
Oh my gosh.

2595
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,180
Get off of me.

2596
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,340
Where is he?

2597
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,900
Oh, nice gun.

2598
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,840
Oh, I'm out of ammo on, like, all of my guns so I'm going to test all of them.

2599
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,420
I'm just gonna die, I guess.

2600
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,400
I guess I'll just die.

2601
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,760
Where's more ammo?

2602
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,000
There was ammo in the bathrooms nearby, remember?

2603
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,420
Yeah, was it here?

2604
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,500
I think it was this way.

2605
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,260
I think it was down here.

2606
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,860
I guess I'll just die.

2607
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:28,880
I guess I'll just die.

2608
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,660
Is it this one?

2609
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,260
There's a pipe bomb in here, if anybody wants it.

2610
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,180
Guys, they're about to all come in through this side.

2611
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,320
There's no ammo in here!

2612
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,020
There's just a knife!

2613
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,400
There was ammo in the bathroom, in the men's bathroom.

2614
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:40,760
Remember?

2615
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,340
Maybe it's in the girl's bathroom this time.

2616
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,380
Maybe it's in the girl's bathroom.

2617
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,340
Guys, I need help.

2618
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:46,960
There's a charger.

2619
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,440
I need ammo.

2620
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:49,880
No!

2621
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,520
They don't have it.

2622
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,080
I think it's randomly generated where it spawns.

2623
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,520
Oh no, I'm so bad.

2624
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:02,380
I guess I'll get the knife since I have nothing else.

2625
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,720
I'll die.

2626
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,280
Get your knife!

2627
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,360
I guess I'll die.

2628
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:08,760
Get your nice, poopy knife!

2629
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,360
Stinky.

2630
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,200
Poopy.

2631
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:12,540
Poopy.

2632
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,400
I like how I just reload the banana every time.

2633
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,220
I'm sticking new banana in the peel.

2634
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,060
What was that song like all the- Ba ba ba ba.

2635
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,860
Wait, who's that?

2636
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,800
Well, we go upstairs don't we?

2637
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,380
Well, we go upstairs don't we?

2638
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,760
Yeah, I think so.

2639
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:32,640
Upstairs here?

2640
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:35,700
Oh, who's coughing like that?

2641
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:36,500
Me.

2642
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,280
Sorry.

2643
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:38,800
I had a cigar.

2644
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,060
Okay, I'm also out of ammo.

2645
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,600
There is a gun here, Mint, if you need it.

2646
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,300
It's a chrome shotgun.

2647
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:49,900
Oh, I'll get the shotgun.

2648
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:51,740
Thank you.

2649
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,000
Behind, behind!

2650
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:53,840
Charger!

2651
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:56,860
Fucking trick!

2652
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,240
Let's go!

2653
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,400
Through here...

2654
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,200
We're doing better than previously.

2655
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:03,920
That's good.

2656
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:04,500
Okay, okay.

2657
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,720
Through this door.

2658
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,880
There might be ammo.

2659
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,660
What is it?

2660
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,980
Oh, I got a defibrillator.

2661
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,720
Oh, another health pack.

2662
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,340
I think, Ken, you should have it, because she's dying.

2663
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:15,620
Boomer.

2664
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,760
You got him.

2665
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:19,740
Sorry, Peter Griffin, but you have to die.

2666
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:20,800
Oh, go!

2667
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:22,800
Thank you.

2668
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,520
Hello!

2669
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,360
Let me one-hit these guys.

2670
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,780
Guys, there's a little bomb there.

2671
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,740
A little bomb.

2672
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,380
I got it.

2673
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,260
I'll use it.

2674
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,380
Guys, a lot of zombies.

2675
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,060
A lot of zombies.

2676
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,840
Sorry if I shot you.

2677
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:45,840
In here?

2678
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,140
Anybody?

2679
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:47,780
Anything?

2680
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:49,520
Oh, ammo!

2681
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,160
There's an ammo here!

2682
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,400
Oh my god, girlie.

2683
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:54,500
Where is it?

2684
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,020
I'm reloading.

2685
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:57,640
Sorry, I didn't notice.

2686
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,920
How are you guys with health, by the way?

2687
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,320
Because I have one extra health pack.

2688
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,680
In my inventory.

2689
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,640
I have pills, so I'm going to take them.

2690
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,080
I was doing okay.

2691
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,880
Take your medication.

2692
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,800
I'm taking my medication, and I got the defibrillator.

2693
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,760
Is that a katana?

2694
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,340
You can go in this door.

2695
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,480
Yeah.

2696
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:15,900
No, that's a gun.

2697
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,680
Oh, there's a first aid place as well here.

2698
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,440
Oh, it's just for pills, though.

2699
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:22,980
No, the pills are good.

2700
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:23,660
Yeah, I'm fine.

2701
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,400
I need pills for them.

2702
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,680
There's a guy behind the door.

2703
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,080
There's a lot.

2704
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:29,340
I'm going to throw a bomb.

2705
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,280
Throw a bomb!

2706
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,160
It kind of worked, though.

2707
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,380
They all came inside.

2708
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,280
It kind of worked out.

2709
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,300
Alright, guys.

2710
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,940
There's another bomb in here.

2711
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,060
We have to disarm the...

2712
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,120
We have to go to the third floor now.

2713
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:51,920
There's going to be endless horde.

2714
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,360
Endless?

2715
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,240
Bottom.

2716
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,740
Haruka, I'm behind you.

2717
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,120
I'm shooting the guys behind you, Haruka.

2718
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,400
I'm shooting the guys behind you.

2719
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:03,840
I'm behind.

2720
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:04,860
Oh, whoa!

2721
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,760
Haruka, I'm backing you up.

2722
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,380
I'm backing you up.

2723
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,640
Don't worry about what's behind you, Haruka.

2724
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,360
Just keep running.

2725
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,440
Just run!

2726
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:13,120
Just run!

2727
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,620
Are we going to go third floor?

2728
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,460
I'm backing you from behind, Haru.

2729
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:19,840
Don't worry.

2730
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,320
How are you guys already on the third floor?

2731
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,800
How the heck are you guys already on the third floor?

2732
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,180
Haruka, I got you.

2733
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:29,500
I got you.

2734
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:29,680
I got you.

2735
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,060
I'm behind you.

2736
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:30,360
I'm behind you.

2737
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:30,680
Keep going.

2738
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:30,940
Keep going.

2739
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,680
Oh, there's fire!

2740
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:32,620
There's fire!

2741
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:33,020
Watch out!

2742
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,620
Haruka, don't worry.

2743
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,020
Don't worry.

2744
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:35,560
Just keep running.

2745
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,960
I'm covering you from behind.

2746
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,540
I went the wrong way.

2747
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,120
I went the wrong way.

2748
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,860
I need to cause the fire!

2749
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,060
Fire!

2750
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,480
Haruka, I'm doing my best.

2751
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,200
Oh, my gosh.

2752
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,240
Help us!

2753
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,480
I'm going to die!

2754
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:50,780
We're coming!

2755
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,420
Haruka, I need a second and I can revive you.

2756
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:54,500
We're coming!

2757
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,380
I don't know if I can revive you.

2758
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:59,360
We're coming!

2759
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:00,060
We're coming!

2760
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,380
Girls, I need one of you to revive Haruka while I'm shooting, please.

2761
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,700
Oh, there's vile!

2762
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,180
There's vile!

2763
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:05,500
Watch out!

2764
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:05,760
Watch out!

2765
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:06,020
Watch out!

2766
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:06,700
Oh, gosh.

2767
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,600
Are you both down?

2768
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:10,960
Wait, what?

2769
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,900
Does one of you have the defibrillator?

2770
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,100
I have it!

2771
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,160
I have the defibrillator!

2772
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:17,880
Saber, Saber, Mint, I'm healing you while this is happening.

2773
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:18,800
Wait, how do I use it?

2774
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,020
Oh, I'm using it!

2775
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:21,420
I'm using it!

2776
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:22,460
Get it!

2777
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:22,700
Get it!

2778
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:22,780
Get it!

2779
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:25,860
I'm healing you!

2780
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,340
Mint, Mint, Mint, stop, stop, stop, Mint.

2781
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,540
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop moving.

2782
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,280
Guys, I need your help!

2783
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:31,940
No, Matara!

2784
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,620
Matara, you need more help than I do!

2785
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,120
It's okay, it's okay, go, go, go, go, go.

2786
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:35,560
No!

2787
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,240
Matara!

2788
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:38,820
Wait, where did my...

2789
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,840
Is my gun gone?

2790
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,640
Go pick it up, maybe?

2791
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,320
There's a med kit here!

2792
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,000
There's a med kit here!

2793
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,860
I'll take this cap.

2794
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,020
Oh, maybe I took your gun by accident.

2795
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:48,340
Shit.

2796
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,420
Actually, I think I accidentally took your gun.

2797
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,320
That's okay.

2798
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,400
Do you want the can back?

2799
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:52,620
No, no.

2800
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:53,340
I want... Can we switch?

2801
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,280
Uh, how do I drop the gun?

2802
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,400
Charge it around, get ready.

2803
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,200
Where's the charger?

2804
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,480
How do we drop the gun?

2805
01:21:59,020 --> 01:21:59,640
Oh, watch out!

2806
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,280
Sorry if I shot you.

2807
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,840
I'm assuming you had this gun in my hand, I'm assuming.

2808
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,580
Hold on, let me accidentally pick up another gun, let's see if that works.

2809
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:07,660
Is it these ones?

2810
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,620
Did I steal your... I didn't pick up a gun.

2811
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,780
Oh, I think I accidentally took your gun because I was pressing E.

2812
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,340
Wait, how do I... How do I drop it?

2813
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,360
How do I drop it?

2814
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,180
There's a gun there.

2815
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,620
Take the other gun, take the other one.

2816
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:19,120
Where's my gun?

2817
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:20,920
Where's my gun?

2818
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,520
There we go, sorry!

2819
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,140
Guys, guys, guys!

2820
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,600
Okay, wait.

2821
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:28,660
Did somebody drop my gun?

2822
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,060
This wasn't my gun.

2823
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,360
I had like a laser scope.

2824
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,060
There you go.

2825
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,400
That's the laser scope one, there you go.

2826
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,240
Guys!

2827
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:37,420
Thank you!

2828
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm taking everybody's guns, apparently.

2829
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,060
It's okay.

2830
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,320
Well, I picked up the one that was on the floor.

2831
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:46,520
And it was yours.

2832
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:49,060
I think you dropped it because you thought it was...

2833
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:49,940
Maybe, maybe.

2834
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,940
Oh my god.

2835
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:53,860
This fucking hurts.

2836
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,740
This game is crazy.

2837
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,440
Do you want to stop playing then?

2838
01:22:58,540 --> 01:22:59,320
Or do you want to keep going?

2839
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,640
Aren't you in a tournament for this?

2840
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:02,960
Yeah!

2841
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,560
I am!

2842
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,560
Are you going to be okay?

2843
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,640
The teams are super unbalanced.

2844
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,280
The Flesh team is so strong.

2845
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,480
They have people who have been content creators for this game.

2846
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,300
But it's also not a real tournament.

2847
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,320
It's like a friend tournament.

2848
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,220
Oh no!

2849
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,080
Oh, she's alive!

2850
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,460
Oh, she's dead.

2851
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,200
I got you.

2852
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:31,020
I did it!

2853
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:33,890
I did it!

2854
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:35,810
If you find ammo, let me know.

2855
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:36,570
Sorry, I hit you.

2856
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,850
That was my feelings.

2857
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,410
I literally revived you.

2858
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:44,590
I think I can get one hit in.

2859
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:47,470
Sorry for being kind of loud, you guys.

2860
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,790
I took you into this world.

2861
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:49,870
I can take you out again.

2862
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:51,470
Actually, I think it's the opposite.

2863
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,910
Stop doing bomb!

2864
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:57,990
Oh!

2865
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,270
There's a molotov here, girls.

2866
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:04,070
Molotov.

2867
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,970
I have a bomb in case we ever need it.

2868
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:08,130
Let me throw a bomb there.

2869
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,690
Here you go.

2870
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:12,590
I think they're going to explode.

2871
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:15,190
Yeah!

2872
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:16,830
I think I shot to myself.

2873
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:17,330
Sorry.

2874
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,350
It's okay.

2875
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:20,870
God dang it.

2876
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:22,090
I'm the one who took it.

2877
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:25,650
At least you tried.

2878
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:26,750
And that is very cute.

2879
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,070
Are we going back downstairs?

2880
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:30,690
I think so.

2881
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:32,770
What is this music I'm hearing?

2882
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:38,030
If you guys see ammo on the floor, let me know.

2883
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:42,690
Ammo on the floor.

2884
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:45,250
I think I need a gun so that you guys don't accidentally shoot me.

2885
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,850
Yeah, you keep running in front of our shot.

2886
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:47,510
Oh, ducky!

2887
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,470
Yeah, I think I need a pistol.

2888
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:52,610
Oh, my mom.

2889
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:55,650
Yeah, I think so.

2890
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,830
Over this katana.

2891
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:57,250
Yeah.

2892
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:00,470
The melee is like really strong but it's hard to use sometimes.

2893
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:01,350
Yeah.

2894
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,230
What is this music I'm hearing?

2895
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:04,930
It's like an accordion.

2896
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:09,790
Yeah, I think it's one of the mods that I have but I don't know what it means.

2897
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,610
Oh, my gosh.

2898
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:13,770
Thank you.

2899
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,130
I protected my...

2900
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:17,890
I protected my...

2901
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,150
You keep going down!

2902
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:24,830
Come on, Mrs. Coffee.

2903
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:26,430
Take it easy, Mrs. Coffee.

2904
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:27,410
If I die, it's forever.

2905
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:31,870
Yeah, I think melee is like coffee.

2906
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:31,990
I got you.

2907
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,010
Where is the safe room?

2908
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:38,450
Oh, is it?

2909
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:38,890
Oh, no.

2910
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:39,490
Not this one.

2911
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:40,010
Oh, what?

2912
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:41,530
Maybe we have to go up?

2913
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,010
Maybe.

2914
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:44,830
I'm hearing the smoker.

2915
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:45,730
I'm hearing Ronald McDonald.

2916
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,830
Oh, here he is!

2917
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:47,270
I see him!

2918
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:47,870
Watch out!

2919
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:48,110
Watch out!

2920
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:51,370
You got him?

2921
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:52,830
Oh, that was close to my head.

2922
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,890
What are you, son of a bitch?

2923
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,990
Where do we go from here?

2924
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:57,330
Upstairs?

2925
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:58,710
Oh, people are saying third floor.

2926
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:00,490
Third floor?

2927
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,350
I forgot I had a med kit on me.

2928
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,170
I'm such an idiot.

2929
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:05,290
Oh, you have one?

2930
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:06,610
Spitter!

2931
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:06,890
Spitter!

2932
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:07,130
Spitter!

2933
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:08,590
Ouchie!

2934
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:08,650
Ouchie!

2935
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:08,830
Ouchie!

2936
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:08,930
Ouchie!

2937
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:12,930
No!

2938
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:13,710
Mrs. Coffee!

2939
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:15,450
Mrs. Puff!

2940
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:16,730
It's okay.

2941
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:17,510
We'll get you.

2942
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:18,230
Oh, thanks, Haruka.

2943
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:18,910
This is it.

2944
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,390
Safe room!

2945
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,230
Safe room!

2946
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:22,790
Nice!

2947
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:26,370
Nice.

2948
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:26,930
I'm coming.

2949
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:27,670
Come on!

2950
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:28,730
Get in!

2951
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,210
Get in!

2952
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:29,890
Ta-da!

2953
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:30,890
Get in, Haruka!

2954
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:31,310
Get in!

2955
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:32,150
Nice!

2956
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,010
Yatta!

2957
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:36,690
Good job!

2958
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:38,610
Yay!

2959
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:40,790
Yatta!

2960
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:43,030
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2961
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:45,110
You got this!

2962
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:45,330
Yeah!

2963
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,170
Look at you!

2964
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:46,970
You're the tank slayer!

2965
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:48,870
I'm the tank slayer.

2966
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,790
I hit the big man with my gun.

2967
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:52,070
This one is hard to find where to go.

2968
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,010
This map is confusing.

2969
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:55,390
Nicely done!

2970
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:57,930
I love this game.

2971
01:26:58,410 --> 01:26:59,090
Me too!

2972
01:26:59,250 --> 01:26:59,730
It's fun!

2973
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:01,590
It's actually really fun.

2974
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,310
It's just a little fast.

2975
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,570
I like it, though.

2976
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:09,230
How can you read which one it is?

2977
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:09,650
It's what?

2978
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:14,310
Oh, you can see it says, like, sniper rifle AK-47 combat shotgun.

2979
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:15,410
No, it doesn't say that.

2980
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:18,410
If you right-click, you can shove your enemies away.

2981
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,790
Hold on, hold on.

2982
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:22,150
Can I pee super quickly before you open the door?

2983
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:22,650
Yeah, of course!

2984
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,150
I'm just gonna go, like, two seconds.

2985
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:25,150
One!

2986
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,310
You can right-click to shove as well.

2987
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:29,650
Manta!

2988
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,410
If you wanted to shove the zombies away, you could just right-click.

2989
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:34,870
Yeah.

2990
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:35,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2991
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,270
Right-click.

2992
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:38,890
Boom.

2993
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:42,530
Change the knife for a gun?

2994
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:44,630
Oh, but there's no pistols or anything.

2995
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,850
Do we get a pistol in the future?

2996
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:50,170
Or is that the only thing we get?

2997
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:53,990
I think there's a pistol in the future, I think.

2998
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:55,070
Oh, okay, okay.

2999
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:56,510
It's this one, right?

3000
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:59,430
I don't see any zombies.

3001
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,770
Let's go with AKs.

3002
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:03,670
I'm with you.

3003
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:06,110
I'm with you.

3004
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:07,070
Yeah, that's true.

3005
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:09,790
No more knife.

3006
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,570
No more knife.

3007
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,450
No more kidney fee.

3008
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:14,530
That's what I like to say.

3009
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,250
No more kidney.

3010
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:18,270
Kidney?

3011
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:19,030
No more kidney.

3012
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:20,830
Kidney fee.

3013
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:23,290
You're looking really dashing, Haruka.

3014
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:24,730
Thanks!

3015
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:25,670
What do I look like?

3016
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:26,850
Can I get a yee-haw?

3017
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:29,010
Yee-haw!

3018
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:29,950
Yeah!

3019
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:32,910
Was that good?

3020
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:33,570
Yeah!

3021
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:36,090
Thanks, thanks.

3022
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,050
What is dashing?

3023
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:38,830
You running?

3024
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,930
It's like very handsome.

3025
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,990
Oh, I see.

3026
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:45,550
It can also mean running, but it can mean handsome too.

3027
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:47,410
Oh, I see.

3028
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:49,090
What do I look like on your screen, Mint?

3029
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,530
You're Doug Dimmadome.

3030
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:51,830
Owner of the Dimmsdale Dimmadome.

3031
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:54,930
But with a really tall hat.

3032
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,230
Oh, fuck yeah.

3033
01:28:57,810 --> 01:28:59,550
That's what I'm talking about.

3034
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:01,670
Let's go, lady.

3035
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,090
Wait, I accidentally switched my gun.

3036
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:05,890
I don't know which gun is which.

3037
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:06,590
Why won't it tell me?

3038
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:10,610
I think I lost my good AK with the sniper scope because I died.

3039
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:11,490
Oh, no!

3040
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:13,410
You'll get another sniper scope.

3041
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:14,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3042
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,250
I'm not too worried.

3043
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:16,390
Alright, are we ready?

3044
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,890
Are you ready?

3045
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,110
I'm ready.

3046
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:22,130
Riki is talking shit to me.

3047
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:27,950
He's telling me that Haruka is doing all the objectives and I'm useless.

3048
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:29,150
He's telling me that Haruka is doing all the objectives and I'm useless.

3049
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:29,790
Oh, thanks, Riki.

3050
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,090
Bottom shotgun.

3051
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:33,890
Washing your hands won't help when they attack you.

3052
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:35,510
Who is Seda?

3053
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:36,590
Seda.

3054
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:40,890
Jamie Gibbs Jr. Thanks, Riki.

3055
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:42,310
I haven't played this game in years.

3056
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:44,590
It's been forever.

3057
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:47,190
He's telling me I'm bad and saying that you're good.

3058
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:48,170
Oh, damn.

3059
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,370
I don't know about that, Riki.

3060
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:52,610
I got a sniper with a...

3061
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:52,930
Oh, my God.

3062
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:54,450
Is this the same gun I was using?

3063
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:55,610
It barely aims.

3064
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:57,990
As well as my previous gun.

3065
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,310
Feels harder to aim this one.

3066
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:03,450
Payout's here.

3067
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:04,710
Payout's here.

3068
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:06,410
I don't take drugs.

3069
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:07,330
Drugs take money.

3070
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:11,750
Is it because my previous gun had like the little laser scope so it was easier to aim?

3071
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,010
Yeah.

3072
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:14,550
Okay, I remember that this is like as far as I've played.

3073
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,390
Not the mall.

3074
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:17,970
We beat this level and it was really tough.

3075
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,070
This one is tough, yeah.

3076
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,370
In the elevator, gang.

3077
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:23,250
Okay.

3078
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,050
So the laser made it easier, damn it.

3079
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,050
Any ideas?

3080
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:32,050
We need to fill the car with gas.

3081
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,570
Oh, my God.

3082
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,810
Okay.

3083
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,050
Do you girls think...

3084
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:40,490
Do we think what?

3085
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:41,190
Hear me out.

3086
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:42,010
Strategy.

3087
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:45,390
Maybe one of us carries the gas while the other ones shoot around them?

3088
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:47,070
Or two and two?

3089
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:48,290
What is a better strategy?

3090
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,250
I just think we hope for the best.

3091
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,670
We don't need no strategy.

3092
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:54,730
You don't want to go in?

3093
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,310
No, we absolutely need a strategy, baby.

3094
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:00,910
We don't need no strategy.

3095
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:01,410
We don't need no strategy.

3096
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:02,370
I think we absolutely.

3097
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:05,730
I got one, I got one.

3098
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:06,710
Haruka, I'm protecting you.

3099
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,190
Okay, Hennia, I'm protecting you.

3100
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:09,790
Oh, never mind.

3101
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:12,110
Hennia, I'm protecting you.

3102
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:12,930
I'm not protecting.

3103
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:13,930
Help me.

3104
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:15,490
Someone help, please.

3105
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:16,170
I'm going to die.

3106
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,110
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

3107
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:18,870
Oh, God.

3108
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:20,710
Oh, God.

3109
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:23,370
Oh, God.

3110
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,880
What the hell?

3111
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,900
What happened to, like, you were protecting her?

3112
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:41,980
I got caught by a smoker and then a jockey, okay?

3113
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:42,860
I got caught by a smoker and then a jockey, okay?

3114
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:43,180
I got caught by a smoker and then a jockey, okay?

3115
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,440
Guys, there's health kits in the middle of the store.

3116
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,080
I'm going to die.

3117
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,260
I'm going to die.

3118
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:49,420
I'm shooting.

3119
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:50,640
I'm shooting.

3120
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:51,560
Oh, thank you.

3121
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,000
Min, there's health kits in the middle, she was saying.

3122
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:55,280
I got a health kit, too.

3123
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:55,820
Oh, my gosh.

3124
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,560
Get off of me.

3125
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,500
I think we need to be two and two.

3126
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:58,580
I think we need to be two and two.

3127
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,180
I think two and two is the strategy here.

3128
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:01,940
Genuinely.

3129
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,460
No one's watching, right?

3130
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,820
Hennia, I'll see you by the car, okay?

3131
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,040
Okay, I'm at the car, I'm at the car.

3132
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,020
Thank you, thank you.

3133
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:10,760
Okay.

3134
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:14,220
If you drop the gas, I'll put it in.

3135
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:14,560
I got you.

3136
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,840
Hennia, I'm protecting you, or actually, I can go with Min if you want.

3137
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:18,980
There you go.

3138
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:19,800
Okay, I'll go.

3139
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,100
Okay, Min, I'm behind you.

3140
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:22,760
Get the gas.

3141
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,580
Let's go get the gas.

3142
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,720
I got the gas, I got the gas.

3143
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,160
I'm getting the gas, I'm getting the gas.

3144
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,060
We can do two and two.

3145
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:27,660
Okay.

3146
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,360
If something happens, we can...

3147
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,600
Wait, where the hell...

3148
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,340
Oh my, oh my.

3149
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,420
Oh, oh, I got him.

3150
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,280
I got him, yeah, you sure did, girl.

3151
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,520
Hey, I took the first...

3152
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,280
You got the finishing shot, but I...

3153
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,760
Guys, guys!

3154
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3155
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,120
Where's your partner?

3156
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:47,880
Where's your partner?

3157
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,700
Haruka's right here.

3158
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,060
You guys were my partner?

3159
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,980
No, Haruka was your partner.

3160
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:54,080
Wait, what?

3161
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,060
Haruka, we gotta be two and two.

3162
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,160
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

3163
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,340
I got three gas on my own.

3164
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,340
What are y'all doing?

3165
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,300
No, we're supposed to be two and two, Haruka.

3166
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:05,300
I'm dropping gas.

3167
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,320
Yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good.

3168
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:09,860
Oh, there's more gas up there.

3169
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,980
Wait a minute, let's go get the other one.

3170
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:11,880
That was really smart of you.

3171
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,240
No, it's Sumi Mountain.

3172
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,840
Wait, Min, Min, Min, I'm gonna go save her.

3173
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,240
Yeah, go save her, go save her, go save her, go save her.

3174
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,960
Okay, wait, Min, you have to save me now.

3175
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:21,760
Oh, wait, what?

3176
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:22,260
What do you mean?

3177
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,180
Wait, what's the music?

3178
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:28,020
I was dropping the gas from the top floor to the ground, so...

3179
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:28,440
I'm coming!

3180
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,780
What just happened?

3181
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,880
What happened to you?

3182
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,160
There's Metal Gear!

3183
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:35,960
I think we have to be two and two together.

3184
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:39,060
Because if we get attacked by the special enemy, we're fucked.

3185
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,240
We have to be two and two.

3186
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:47,300
So what I was doing, I was going to the top stairs, and I was standing on the ledge, and I was dropping it down, so it's easier instead of going down the stairs.

3187
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:48,180
That's what I was doing.

3188
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,460
Well, can one of us stay with you then, Haru?

3189
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,240
Oh, oh, oh gosh.

3190
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:54,920
Please, please!

3191
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,000
I got a Jackie!

3192
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:58,680
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3193
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,520
Good job, good job.

3194
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:02,920
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

3195
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,400
Okay, uh...

3196
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,000
Okay, I'm going upstairs.

3197
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,800
Oh, there's one up here, there's one up here.

3198
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,880
I don't know how to get to this one over here.

3199
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:14,460
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3200
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:14,980
Min, Min, Min.

3201
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,500
Wait one second, I'm behind, I'm behind.

3202
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,560
Ice cream!

3203
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,660
Min, Min, Min, do you want to get the ones in the back over there?

3204
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,080
Which one?

3205
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:23,420
Okay.

3206
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:25,200
In front of me, in front of where I am.

3207
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,220
What do you mean in front of you?

3208
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,540
What are we talking about?

3209
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:30,380
Oh, shoot.

3210
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,300
I don't know.

3211
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,340
Ow, I'm pinned!

3212
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:40,960
Oh, thank you.

3213
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:41,340
I got you, I got you.

3214
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,320
Thank you, Haruka.

3215
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,660
Min, Min, Min, come with me.

3216
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:45,820
There's two more over here.

3217
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:46,120
Okay.

3218
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,120
Oh, over this way.

3219
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:47,540
Okay, okay.

3220
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,900
Yeah, they're like over that way.

3221
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:49,080
See?

3222
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:49,840
Let's go over there.

3223
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:50,280
Yeah.

3224
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,900
Okay, if you guys drop it, we can put it in.

3225
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,400
Oh, sorry.

3226
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:54,520
What the heck?

3227
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,340
I couldn't figure out how to... Oh, there's some over here.

3228
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,180
Wait, there's some here?

3229
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:58,880
Yeah, there's some over here.

3230
01:34:58,940 --> 01:34:59,900
Yeah, throw them around.

3231
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:01,560
Ice cream!

3232
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,200
Good girl.

3233
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:04,880
Uh-oh, there's more, there's more, there's more.

3234
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:06,860
I'll shoot some of these guys while...

3235
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,000
Oh, there's some over here, over here.

3236
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,060
Oh my god, I can't see.

3237
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:11,120
How did you throw?

3238
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,220
Uh, I left-clicked.

3239
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,040
Oh my god.

3240
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,040
Good job, girly.

3241
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,640
Okay, I'm getting the ones over here.

3242
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,400
Oh, attack!

3243
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,960
Oh, oh, I need help, I need help, I need help.

3244
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,600
Min, Min, Min, I need help.

3245
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,180
I see you!

3246
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,220
Wait, I don't see you.

3247
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,640
Oh my gosh, where's the... I need help, I'm on the stairs, I'm on the stairs.

3248
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,200
I'm trying to get the smoker.

3249
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,180
Good girl, good girl.

3250
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:29,400
Hennie, do you have Haruka?

3251
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:30,920
Yeah.

3252
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,320
Let's win.

3253
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,440
Do you think we have all the gas together?

3254
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:35,200
I'm getting, I'm getting the last two, maybe?

3255
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:35,760
I'm following you, Min.

3256
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:36,580
I'm following you, Min.

3257
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,380
I think this is the last two.

3258
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:41,200
Every time we fill up the gas, a whore comes in.

3259
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,940
So let's wait till all the gas are together.

3260
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,680
Wait a minute, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

3261
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:45,780
Hold on.

3262
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,180
Hold on, Min.

3263
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,140
Free ice cream!

3264
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,900
I think every time we fill up the car, the whore comes in.

3265
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,440
So let's wait till we have all the gas together.

3266
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3267
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:59,580
Let's wait it, let's wait it.

3268
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,980
Okay, Min, I'm behind you.

3269
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:05,440
Are you?

3270
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,200
I'm far behind you, but I'm behind you.

3271
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,440
Are we going down to the girls?

3272
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,060
Yeah, because there's ice cream.

3273
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,340
Are they actually all ice cream for you?

3274
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,000
Is that what it is?

3275
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:19,060
No, I have a, whenever there's a whore, a Spongebob yelling, free ice cream.

3276
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:21,640
There you go.

3277
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,880
Okay, how many are we missing?

3278
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:24,620
Oh, sorry.

3279
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:26,000
What's seven plus four?

3280
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:26,480
Eleven?

3281
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,360
We need two more.

3282
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:28,360
Is there one over here?

3283
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,340
I guess it's gone.

3284
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:31,120
Oh, big guy, big guy.

3285
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:31,320
Where?

3286
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,580
All the two are over here.

3287
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,000
I don't know how to ping, but it's there.

3288
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,380
I'll make it over here.

3289
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,140
Oh my god, I can't hit.

3290
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:42,660
I can't hit.

3291
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,120
Oh, fuck, I'm conned, I'm conned, I'm conned.

3292
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,320
I'm down, I'm down.

3293
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:49,040
I'm down too, I'm down too, I'm down too.

3294
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,420
Thank you, Haru.

3295
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:53,620
Help me, please.

3296
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,540
I'm coming, Min, I'm coming, Min.

3297
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,920
I'm killing my team more than the fucking zombies.

3298
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,940
Oh, he's down, he's down.

3299
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:02,880
He's already raising.

3300
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Henya, I'm raising you.

3301
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:06,320
I need a gun.

3302
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:08,380
Reloading.

3303
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:09,860
Thank you.

3304
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,120
You're welcome.

3305
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:14,180
Girls, there's two health kits right here, Min and Henya, in the back.

3306
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:14,720
Oh, thank you.

3307
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,080
Wait, where?

3308
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,880
Seven plus one, two, three, four.

3309
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:23,380
Behind the...

3310
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,480
Do you see where I'm looking at?

3311
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,060
They're over there.

3312
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,000
Yeah, I'm coming to see you.

3313
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:27,920
Let's go, let's go.

3314
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:30,180
Wait, Min, I'm still here.

3315
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:33,000
I can't heal myself because of the horde.

3316
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,000
How do we get there?

3317
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,140
We're gonna find out the hard way.

3318
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:39,260
Ouch.

3319
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,640
I can't see, I can't see, I can't see, I can't see.

3320
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,100
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down.

3321
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:47,640
I got you, I got you, I got you.

3322
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,360
Hold on, I'm taking care of these guys first.

3323
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,080
Then I'll get you, I'll get you.

3324
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,400
It looks like it's moving too.

3325
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,800
Oh my god, I can't...

3326
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:58,580
I can't get you.

3327
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:00,660
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

3328
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,340
Oh my.

3329
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,620
I got you.

3330
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:04,920
I'm good, I'm good.

3331
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,420
I got you, I got you.

3332
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,720
Yeah, you...

3333
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,140
Okay, so...

3334
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,340
The gas cans...

3335
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,900
get blown up, you guys.

3336
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:19,280
No way.

3337
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,640
I swear that's what just happened.

3338
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,240
No way.

3339
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,640
The gas cans are gone.

3340
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:25,920
Wait, but where's...

3341
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,920
Wait, there's no more gas.

3342
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,080
Nope.

3343
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:29,720
No, they all spawn back.

3344
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,520
They do?

3345
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,820
Oh, I see, I see.

3346
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:32,860
They're back up there.

3347
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:33,620
Oh my god.

3348
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,800
The thing is, I'm pretty sure if you shoot the gas tanks, they'll spawn fire, so don't shoot them.

3349
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,500
Oh my god.

3350
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:43,320
Let's put... how about this?

3351
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,160
Let's put like two more, and then we'll put the rest of like...

3352
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:46,960
Help, please!

3353
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,700
Oh, thank you.

3354
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,620
No, but the thing is, every time we fill a car, a horde comes in.

3355
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,440
Yeah, yeah, so let's do two, and then let's do four.

3356
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,340
The ice cream never ends!

3357
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:01,040
That way we don't have a chance to like shoot it and kill it.

3358
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,180
I think the one right here is easier.

3359
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:03,620
Or like three and three.

3360
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:05,680
Oh wait, okay, we gotta keep going, never mind.

3361
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:07,940
I went up the wrong stairs.

3362
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,120
How does that feel?

3363
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:08,980
I went up the wrong stairs.

3364
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,320
Three and three, or like two and four?

3365
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,460
What do you mean three and three?

3366
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:15,400
We have to like split up the amount of them that we're doing.

3367
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,760
Oh, I'm getting gas right now, so...

3368
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,080
Oh, I'm on the wrong floor!

3369
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:21,680
Are you really?

3370
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,560
I got you, I got you.

3371
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,640
I got you, Henry!

3372
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:30,400
There's also kills here, Mint, if you want, since you might need the extra 100% health.

3373
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,000
Yeah, grab him here.

3374
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,700
Oh, you killed Peter?

3375
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,960
Yay, I killed Peter!

3376
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:37,720
Help!

3377
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,440
Oh fuck, I just fell!

3378
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,500
Tank is back, Kenya!

3379
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:44,540
Oh my god!

3380
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,180
Oh my god!

3381
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:46,440
Noooo!

3382
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,260
Oh my god, please!

3383
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:51,620
How do you throw the gas, by the way?

3384
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,800
Just left click, left click.

3385
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,500
It's not letting me.

3386
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,220
Really?

3387
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:58,680
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

3388
01:39:58,820 --> 01:39:59,140
Oh my god.

3389
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,340
Yowie paddle time, stop!

3390
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:08,500
What is this?

3391
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,360
Oh, I got some...

3392
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,560
There's a lot of bombs over here.

3393
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,780
Oh, bio bomb, okay.

3394
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,400
I grabbed that for something.

3395
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,080
I killed him.

3396
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,200
Nice!

3397
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:21,380
Gosh.

3398
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:23,420
Okay.

3399
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:27,000
Oh, help me!

3400
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:28,180
Oh, help me!

3401
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,060
Where are you, where are you, where are you, Mint?

3402
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:31,780
I'm on the stairs.

3403
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:33,780
Thank you.

3404
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:34,800
Good job.

3405
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,620
Mint, I'm not next to you.

3406
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:37,300
I'm downstairs.

3407
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,420
I'm coming upstairs.

3408
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,300
I don't know how to get to the other...

3409
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,300
Here we go, this is where we need to go.

3410
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,660
Where do I go?

3411
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:46,220
Over here?

3412
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,200
Oh fuck, I just blew up the other...

3413
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,860
I even knew I fucking had to...

3414
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:51,920
I'm so silly.

3415
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:52,700
It's okay.

3416
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:58,400
How do we get to...

3417
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,560
Mint, let's get that one on the floor there that they just dropped.

3418
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,120
Okay.

3419
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,200
Oh my god, oh my god.

3420
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:06,060
Oh my god, charger!

3421
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:09,260
Yeah, fine, fine, fine.

3422
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:11,080
Okay.

3423
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,940
This is the most frustrating one I saw, I swear.

3424
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,640
Mint, let's get both of these and fill them in at the same time.

3425
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:21,160
Yeah!

3426
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:24,160
Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I just blew it up!

3427
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,560
It's okay, I did the same thing.

3428
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,260
Don't even sweat it.

3429
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,900
I'll fill both of these pretty much at the same time.

3430
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,820
I think we have to go this way.

3431
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so too.

3432
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:33,680
Oh, there you go!

3433
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,300
Oh my god.

3434
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,060
Bile, bile, bile.

3435
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:39,440
Oh, I'm down!

3436
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:41,960
I'm down, I'm down.

3437
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:42,280
Mint, I'm coming.

3438
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:43,380
I'm kind of far though.

3439
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,180
It's okay if I die.

3440
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:46,560
No, it's not.

3441
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:47,680
I'm coming up.

3442
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,680
Mint, shut up!

3443
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,560
Don't die, you bitch!

3444
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,780
You're supposed to haunt me forever, you bitch!

3445
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:57,320
Oh fuck, Mint, no!

3446
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,360
No, no, hold on, maybe I can...

3447
01:41:59,360 --> 01:41:59,980
I got tongued.

3448
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:01,860
Have I been able to save you?

3449
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:03,780
I don't think so.

3450
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,620
Can you go get them?

3451
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,280
I can't get the tongued.

3452
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,740
Sorry, I fell down, I fell down.

3453
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:10,300
I'm coming back.

3454
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:11,540
I couldn't get the tongued.

3455
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,060
But wait a minute, let me save Mata.

3456
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:14,400
Go get Mata.

3457
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,400
Okay, I'm gonna go get Mata.

3458
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:21,200
Free ice cream!

3459
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,460
Oh no!

3460
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:27,100
Oh my god, no way.

3461
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,280
No way, no way, no way, no way!

3462
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:30,920
Ah, ah, ha, ha!

3463
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,160
I just...

3464
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,680
I just got up, man.

3465
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:35,800
I just got up.

3466
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:42,620
I'm reloading, I'm reloading.

3467
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,180
Oh my god.

3468
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,460
Oh my god.

3469
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:57,690
Matara, you're down!

3470
01:42:58,090 --> 01:42:59,690
I am down.

3471
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:00,810
Oh no!

3472
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:03,730
Free ice cream!

3473
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:05,470
Free ice cream!

3474
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:07,870
Okay, I think...

3475
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:09,750
Strategy time.

3476
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:11,530
Fuck the ball!

3477
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:12,230
Yay!

3478
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:13,790
Yay!

3479
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:17,770
So, does it actually...

3480
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:21,130
Can I ask our chat, does it actually get harder the more gas you fill in?

3481
01:43:22,010 --> 01:43:25,050
Yeah, every time you put the gas in, it makes it work.

3482
01:43:26,230 --> 01:43:29,630
So that's why we gotta gather all the gas and then put it in at once.

3483
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:34,030
But if even one of us shoots the gas, it's all gonna blow up.

3484
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,230
So I don't think it's a good idea.

3485
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:43,550
Here's an idea, what if we gather two and two and two and two everywhere, like not at the car, but we drop all the gas on the bottom floor.

3486
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:44,350
Yeah.

3487
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:47,310
So that way, even if we blow up a gas, we're only blowing up two gases.

3488
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:49,450
We're not blowing up like a million gases.

3489
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,130
Do you know what I mean?

3490
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:54,510
Oh, like leave them where you drop them?

3491
01:43:54,890 --> 01:44:01,470
Like it's gonna be two, two, two, two, two, two, instead of like seven gases at the, you know, at the car.

3492
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:04,350
You can just place them behind somewhere else if we don't accidentally shoot them.

3493
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:09,090
Yeah, cause the problem is if we shoot one gas by accident, it's gonna blow up all the gases that are...

3494
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:11,310
And people are saying the spitter can trigger it.

3495
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:17,890
Um, and I also think we should be in teams of two, because if one of us gets like attacked by a spitter or something, the teammate can help.

3496
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:19,850
Okay, okay.

3497
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:24,410
Are we good with like keeping me and Mint, Henya, Haruka, or do you guys wanna change?

3498
01:44:25,410 --> 01:44:26,010
I'm good.

3499
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:26,490
I'm good.

3500
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:27,590
Okay.

3501
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:28,610
I just wanna kill things.

3502
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:34,050
Okay, so if you kill things, then Henya, you grab the gas, and Haruka, you kill stuff to protect her.

3503
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:34,430
Okay.

3504
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:40,330
Someone said in my chat like every fourth tank or so is a tank, or sorry, every fourth can.

3505
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:44,410
So that means we should do 5-4-4.

3506
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,650
5-4-4, cause it's 13 total.

3507
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:49,390
Okay.

3508
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:52,190
Instead of getting 4-4-1, it's gonna be harder.

3509
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:53,410
We should do 5-4-4.

3510
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:55,290
Is that okay?

3511
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:55,690
I'm confused.

3512
01:44:57,310 --> 01:44:57,930
We're killing?

3513
01:44:58,610 --> 01:44:59,170
Yeah, we're killing.

3514
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:00,850
Alright, let's go.

3515
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:02,570
Are we going the right way?

3516
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:02,950
Yeah.

3517
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:03,850
Wasn't it the other way?

3518
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:05,130
No, that's the right way.

3519
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,150
It's down here.

3520
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:08,630
I hear music.

3521
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:09,470
Again.

3522
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:10,690
Alright, girls.

3523
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:12,670
It's fucking time.

3524
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:13,510
Hi!

3525
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:15,590
Thank you, Mom.

3526
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:17,370
Henya, are you okay?

3527
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:18,850
Sorry, I was fixing my mom!

3528
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:21,030
Your mom!

3529
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,620
Oh, wait, I got your wrong gun.

3530
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:31,640
Sorry, Mom, I can't have dinner.

3531
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:32,620
I'm currently trying to save the world.

3532
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,140
I got the wrong gun.

3533
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:33,540
Hold on.

3534
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:36,640
Saving what's left of humanity.

3535
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,440
Yeah, sorry, Mom.

3536
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,960
I gotta save what's left of humanity.

3537
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,160
You can have fun in your resort.

3538
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:41,440
Hold on.

3539
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:44,380
Can you wait one second before getting into the elevator?

3540
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:45,080
I wanna switch guns.

3541
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,000
Hurry up!

3542
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:47,260
Okay.

3543
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:47,960
I wanna get the AK.

3544
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,560
You can't go in the elevator.

3545
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:50,760
You just can't press the button.

3546
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,280
They're all coming, though.

3547
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:54,480
No lunch for today.

3548
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:54,900
I'm good.

3549
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:55,400
Thank you.

3550
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,100
There they go.

3551
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,040
Thanks, Mom!

3552
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:57,560
I'm coming.

3553
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:58,700
Thanks, Mom!

3554
01:45:58,980 --> 01:45:59,780
Thank you, Mom!

3555
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:00,920
Here they come!

3556
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,520
Here they come!

3557
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:02,700
Maybe I need it.

3558
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:06,760
Can you ask Mamanya if there's any delicious Reese's that she wants?

3559
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:07,740
I'll bring them for her.

3560
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:09,000
Oh, they're climbing.

3561
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,460
She likes ranch sauce!

3562
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:11,760
Ranch sauce?

3563
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:12,880
Alright, I can bring some ranch.

3564
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:15,080
Do you know her favorite brand?

3565
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:16,740
I like ranch, too.

3566
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,180
I'll ask her.

3567
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:18,980
Thank you, though.

3568
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:20,080
Really?

3569
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:20,840
Thank you.

3570
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:25,560
Could you ask your mom what is your favorite Japanese food, too, so I can give it to you?

3571
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:26,900
Um...

3572
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,280
My mom likes those little, like, bird-shaped ones.

3573
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,020
They're in the shape of a little bird.

3574
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,380
It's like a little marshmallow, kind of like a bird.

3575
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,820
Oh, look up here.

3576
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,560
Ranch sauce, you guys!

3577
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:40,240
Oh, my gosh.

3578
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:40,660
Wait, birds?

3579
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,780
Don't you know birds are drones for the government?

3580
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:43,760
Yeah.

3581
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,080
They are!

3582
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:48,120
You got it?

3583
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:52,000
Actually, my Oka-san likes pan.

3584
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:53,080
She likes bread.

3585
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,480
Did she like Japanese bread?

3586
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:55,940
Alright.

3587
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:57,220
I'm following you.

3588
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:57,460
Yeah.

3589
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,500
No, Mint, let's go get the... Oh!

3590
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:02,800
Put it behind the car.

3591
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:03,080
Yeah!

3592
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:05,680
Let's put it behind the car.

3593
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,180
Oh, Mint, behind me.

3594
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:09,960
Thank you, girl.

3595
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:12,120
Sorry if I shot you a little bit while that happened.

3596
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,260
It's okay.

3597
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,500
Spitter, spitter.

3598
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,900
Alright, are you ready?

3599
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,100
Manta, I need you to come over here.

3600
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:18,740
I'm here.

3601
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:19,240
One second.

3602
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:20,200
I was getting attacked.

3603
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,640
Should I shot you, Mint?

3604
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,080
You can't go.

3605
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,320
Can I shot you many times, too?

3606
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,480
Here, bring this health kit with you.

3607
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:26,320
Bring an x-ray with you.

3608
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,680
Okay, I'm bringing some gas.

3609
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,740
I think I already have one.

3610
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:29,460
I'm following you, Mint.

3611
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,340
Then let's just go.

3612
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,060
Ice cream!

3613
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:34,440
Here we go.

3614
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:35,320
Oh my gosh.

3615
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,000
I never thought I want ice cream this much until now.

3616
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:38,080
I'm helping.

3617
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:38,480
I'm helping.

3618
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:38,920
One second.

3619
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:39,820
I'm also...

3620
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:41,220
There's a horde on me, too, girly.

3621
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,160
Oh my gosh.

3622
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:44,900
Don't shoot over here.

3623
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:45,620
Don't shoot over here.

3624
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,240
They're fine.

3625
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:46,980
They're fine.

3626
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,820
Oh, I found it.

3627
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,200
I found it.

3628
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:49,640
I found it.

3629
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:50,620
There's two.

3630
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,060
There's two.

3631
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:52,140
Okay.

3632
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:54,440
I think if we have five, we should load it.

3633
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,260
Do we have five?

3634
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,000
Uh, we have three.

3635
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:58,460
We have three.

3636
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,000
Okay.

3637
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:02,680
Hold on, Mint.

3638
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:04,960
Hold on one more.

3639
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:05,940
Let me grab it.

3640
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,180
One second, Mint.

3641
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:08,760
I'm behind you.

3642
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:10,680
I'm far behind you.

3643
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:11,980
You're far behind me.

3644
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,760
Wait, I did?

3645
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:16,880
I'm far behind you, Mint.

3646
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,440
Where are you?

3647
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,140
I'm upstairs.

3648
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:19,940
Yeah, throw these two down.

3649
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:20,400
That's perfect.

3650
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,460
Good job, girl.

3651
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:23,060
No, I don't have it.

3652
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:23,780
I don't have it.

3653
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,440
You got the other one?

3654
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:25,800
Nice.

3655
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:26,480
Throw it down.

3656
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,040
Throw it down.

3657
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:28,100
Wait, what did I just see?

3658
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:28,300
Perfect.

3659
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:28,640
Good girl.

3660
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:30,980
Let's bring these closer.

3661
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,200
I got my banana.

3662
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:34,640
Don't worry.

3663
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,880
We can grab these two as well.

3664
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:41,140
I don't know if we can grab them without setting it on fire.

3665
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:41,500
We're done.

3666
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,080
We're done.

3667
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:43,760
I'm far up.

3668
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:44,520
I'm far from you, Mint.

3669
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:45,460
Alright, let's go.

3670
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:46,020
I'm downstairs.

3671
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:46,400
I'm sorry.

3672
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:46,880
I'm sorry.

3673
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:47,780
I'm upstairs.

3674
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,020
Why are you upstairs?

3675
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:50,480
I'm sorry.

3676
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:50,700
I'm sorry.

3677
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:51,880
Why are you loading them in?

3678
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,260
Should I... I mean, there's already a horde.

3679
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,020
I think you could.

3680
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:54,740
I think you...

3681
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:57,140
Just be careful that we don't blow them up by accident.

3682
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:58,040
I'm gonna load... Oh!

3683
01:48:58,200 --> 01:48:58,500
Oh!

3684
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:58,900
Oh!

3685
01:48:59,240 --> 01:48:59,320
Oh!

3686
01:48:59,760 --> 01:48:59,820
Hey!

3687
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:01,300
B-b-b-back off, buddy!

3688
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,340
B-b-b-b-b!

3689
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,340
I gotta be careful not to... How do I load it?

3690
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:04,960
How do I load it?

3691
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:05,260
Oh, shit!

3692
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:05,760
I need help!

3693
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,120
I need help!

3694
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:06,300
Mint!

3695
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:06,480
Mint!

3696
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:06,660
Mint!

3697
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:06,740
Mint!

3698
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:07,300
I'm coming!

3699
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:07,600
I'm coming!

3700
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:07,860
I'm coming!

3701
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,600
Behind you!

3702
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:08,860
Behind you!

3703
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:09,740
Behind you!

3704
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,100
Oh, my God.

3705
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,320
Oh, we're in trouble.

3706
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,280
We're in trouble!

3707
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:16,300
We're in trouble!

3708
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:17,980
Girls, girls, we need your help.

3709
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3710
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:21,840
Oh, my God.

3711
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,160
We need your help, girls.

3712
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,000
There's a tank.

3713
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:25,580
We need your help.

3714
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,160
I'm down.

3715
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:26,720
I'm down.

3716
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:27,280
Okay, okay, okay.

3717
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:27,780
We're coming.

3718
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,160
We're coming.

3719
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:28,700
We're coming.

3720
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:28,880
I'm down.

3721
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:29,420
Be careful.

3722
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,980
Don't blow up the gas canisters.

3723
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:31,580
We got a ton.

3724
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:31,940
We're sold.

3725
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:33,440
It's Jover.

3726
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:35,160
It's not Jover.

3727
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:35,560
It's fine.

3728
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:36,300
La-di-da!

3729
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,420
It's up to you, Hanya.

3730
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:38,880
No!

3731
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,580
Oh, you were doing so good.

3732
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,840
I don't know about that!

3733
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,660
Hanya, can you pick me up quickly, if you can?

3734
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:48,600
Okay.

3735
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,060
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3736
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,800
Mrs. Puff!

3737
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:53,780
Mrs. Puff!

3738
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,020
I need some help!

3739
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:55,600
I need some help!

3740
01:49:59,020 --> 01:49:59,420
Careful.

3741
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:01,920
Oh, for third ball damage!

3742
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:02,440
Yes!

3743
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:11,190
I didn't want to throw the bomb.

3744
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,490
I was scared about.

3745
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:16,390
I thought we were doing so good this time around, though.

3746
01:50:16,490 --> 01:50:18,510
I think it doesn't matter if you load them or not.

3747
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:19,410
The horde just comes.

3748
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:22,150
I think if you pick them, if you touch them, the horde comes, right?

3749
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:22,730
Really?

3750
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:23,470
I don't know.

3751
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:29,230
So, if you guys want what Hanya and I have been doing, we've been putting the gas behind the car.

3752
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:30,510
Yeah, that's what we did.

3753
01:50:30,650 --> 01:50:31,610
That's what we were doing.

3754
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:35,150
But then I tried loading it and then the tank came out.

3755
01:50:35,970 --> 01:50:36,330
Well...

3756
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:37,470
Shit.

3757
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:38,810
Let's try it again.

3758
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:41,190
I think we had a good vibe over here.

3759
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:42,210
I think we had a good vibe.

3760
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:48,050
I think maybe what we should do, when we're closer to like loading a bunch of them in, let's all stick together at the end.

3761
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:51,430
For real, for real.

3762
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:51,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3763
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:53,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3764
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:57,070
I don't know if they actually heard me.

3765
01:50:58,350 --> 01:50:59,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3766
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:01,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3767
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:02,310
Sorry guys, I have a cold.

3768
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:05,590
Do you think they heard me or do you think they're just...

3769
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:07,990
I guess we'll find out.

3770
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:10,210
Sorry Hanya, let me wipe my nose.

3771
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:11,730
There you go.

3772
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:14,510
What is happening?

3773
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:16,070
Nice one, nice one.

3774
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:19,630
I was wiping my nose because I clearly sneezed.

3775
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:20,850
Yeah, she sneezed.

3776
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:26,790
Let's go.

3777
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:27,850
How do we start this?

3778
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:31,510
Let's go downstairs.

3779
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:33,330
I have a joke.

3780
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:36,150
Why did the chicken cross the bridge?

3781
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:37,190
Why?

3782
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:40,030
To get to the other side.

3783
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:41,970
Oh, that's a good one.

3784
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:46,830
Oh, sorry.

3785
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:47,730
No.

3786
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:00,900
I was like...

3787
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:01,540
Just pour it in.

3788
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,540
Just pour it in.

3789
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:04,500
Wait, that's not Mitt, that's Hanya.

3790
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,620
Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, let's go together.

3791
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,620
Oh, I guess let's protect Hanya for like two seconds because she's alone.

3792
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,140
Yeah.

3793
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,500
I'm pouring in the gas.

3794
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,480
Okay, I'm gonna put it right behind it.

3795
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:16,460
Alright, Henry.

3796
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,280
I got you, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.

3797
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:21,380
I got you, I got you, I got you.

3798
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,480
Okay, there we go.

3799
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,200
Oh, guys, I need help.

3800
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:25,160
Yeah, I got you.

3801
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,300
I think I got...

3802
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:27,320
Oh, my God, leave me alone.

3803
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:28,900
Where is it taking you?

3804
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:32,480
Oh, my God.

3805
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:34,220
Here, I'll bring you to the back here.

3806
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,640
It was like taking you away.

3807
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,180
It really was.

3808
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:37,980
It likes me.

3809
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,160
Oh, sorry if I hit you.

3810
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:42,000
Okay, I'm ready.

3811
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:43,220
Alright, Hanya.

3812
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,540
Let's go back upstairs where we belong.

3813
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,660
Yeah, let's go there.

3814
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,360
Where we belong?

3815
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,820
I thought you were some asshole chasing me.

3816
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:53,260
Yeah.

3817
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:56,700
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

3818
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,780
The Harunia is strong.

3819
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,920
The Harunia is stronger than anything.

3820
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,380
Watch out, the horse is gonna appear from that back room.

3821
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:03,360
Be prepared.

3822
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:05,360
I'm going upstairs, Matata.

3823
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,540
Okay, I'm following you.

3824
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:09,200
I'm gonna put away.

3825
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,720
I got you, I got you, I got you.

3826
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,760
To the left, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.

3827
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:14,560
Oh, no, never mind.

3828
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:15,280
I'm so stupid.

3829
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:18,020
I got you, I got you.

3830
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:18,440
Left here.

3831
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,840
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3832
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:20,680
Oh, no.

3833
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,920
Alright, then.

3834
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,620
Should we go to the middle stair?

3835
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,180
Are they coming through here?

3836
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:27,700
Yes.

3837
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:30,780
Oh, fuck.

3838
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:31,860
I got one.

3839
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,220
Oh, no.

3840
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:36,500
I'm sorry.

3841
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:38,140
Was it you?

3842
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:38,840
I thought it was me.

3843
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:40,460
It was me, it was me.

3844
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:41,000
I'm sorry.

3845
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:45,680
It was all you.

3846
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:47,600
It was all you.

3847
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,080
I think we can go up from here.

3848
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:52,700
All you.

3849
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:56,780
Here, I'm just putting the gas tank behind the carpet.

3850
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:57,860
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3851
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:59,300
Yeah, maybe we should...

3852
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:01,520
Oh, well, well, well, Panels.

3853
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,040
What?

3854
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,100
What caught on fire?

3855
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:05,940
Okay, okay.

3856
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:10,720
I remember the day you took my life from me.

3857
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:11,640
Wait, how do we get over there?

3858
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,140
It's time to end it, Panels.

3859
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:13,440
What is he?

3860
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,140
Go, go, go.

3861
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:17,440
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

3862
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:19,760
Oh, yeah, girls.

3863
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:21,480
There aren't a lot of girls.

3864
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,080
There's a couple.

3865
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,940
Guys, I need help.

3866
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,900
I accidentally fell off the stairs.

3867
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:30,040
Oh, help me, please.

3868
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:30,880
Someone...

3869
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,940
Can you please go up?

3870
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:34,860
Go up?

3871
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:35,620
Go up the stairs?

3872
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:36,700
Go up the stairs.

3873
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,560
Oh, I see you, I see you, I see you.

3874
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:40,440
I didn't realize that was a thing.

3875
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:41,840
What happened to you?

3876
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:42,580
What did you do?

3877
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:43,900
Don't ask, don't ask, don't ask.

3878
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,420
You don't need to know.

3879
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:45,920
Okay.

3880
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,080
I think we should load the gas into the car.

3881
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:52,600
I think we should load the current gas into the car, y'all.

3882
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,820
Wait, there's a tank!

3883
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,500
There's a tank!

3884
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:55,340
There's a tank!

3885
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:57,780
After the tank is dead, I think we should load the current gas into the car.

3886
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:58,520
Uh-oh, I'm out of ammo.

3887
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:01,040
There's a bunch of ammo downstairs.

3888
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:01,680
Yeah, I know.

3889
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,320
I gotta go get that.

3890
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:05,180
I ain't going down without a fucking piece of shit.

3891
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,660
Come at me!

3892
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:08,540
Good job.

3893
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:10,920
Can I reload for you?

3894
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:12,580
Good job.

3895
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:14,120
Good job, girls.

3896
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:14,320
Good job, girls.

3897
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,160
Oh my gosh.

3898
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,960
Alright, I'm gonna start loading the gas in the car.

3899
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,080
Okay.

3900
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:22,200
Be careful.

3901
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:24,520
Mint, if you can protect me, Mint.

3902
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:27,400
I'm just a single ghost, you know?

3903
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,820
Just a single ghost.

3904
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,060
I'm just a single...

3905
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:31,440
You know what, Henry?

3906
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,600
Let's go get more gas.

3907
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:33,760
Yeah, let's go.

3908
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:34,600
I think it's up.

3909
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:37,220
You better hurry up, Mata.

3910
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,460
I'm only gonna do five.

3911
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:41,520
Gotta reload.

3912
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:43,200
Gotta reload.

3913
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:44,640
Gotta reload.

3914
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,920
Gotta reload.

3915
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:48,700
Keep doing it.

3916
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:49,160
Keep doing it.

3917
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:51,400
I think they're following... I think they're going after...

3918
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:54,040
Henya and Haruka.

3919
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,340
Alright, I'm gonna stop at five.

3920
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:56,600
Yeah, yeah.

3921
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:57,040
Keep going.

3922
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:58,300
What was that?

3923
01:55:58,940 --> 01:55:59,360
It's fine.

3924
01:55:59,420 --> 01:55:59,580
It's fine.

3925
01:55:59,620 --> 01:55:59,980
I killed them.

3926
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,100
Alright, Mint.

3927
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,580
This is kinda peaceful, actually.

3928
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:06,840
Mint, do you wanna get pills for the health?

3929
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:08,300
There's pills here if you want.

3930
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:10,460
Haruka!

3931
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:10,740
Haruka!

3932
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:11,000
Haruka!

3933
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:11,600
I see you.

3934
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:12,040
I see you.

3935
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:12,640
I got you.

3936
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:14,780
Mint, Mint, I got you.

3937
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:15,340
Thank you.

3938
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:17,220
Mint, do you need drugs?

3939
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,840
No, I think I'm good.

3940
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:19,080
You sure?

3941
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:21,080
I'm gonna pick up a med kit anyway, though.

3942
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:22,180
Okay, do it.

3943
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:26,240
Mint, I'm gonna grab this gas over here, okay?

3944
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,280
Yep, I'm protecting you.

3945
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,080
Wait, Mint, behind...

3946
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,340
I'm gonna put it behind the car.

3947
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:33,680
We have four more gases.

3948
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:36,580
We're gonna blow up these gases.

3949
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:37,180
I know we are.

3950
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,000
No, we won't.

3951
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:38,480
We won't.

3952
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:38,740
We won't.

3953
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:39,020
We won't.

3954
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,300
Don't worry.

3955
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,820
I'm gonna put it in the car.

3956
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,080
Get out of my way.

3957
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:44,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3958
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,140
You can start putting it in the car.

3959
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,260
Mint, you're fine.

3960
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:48,640
You're fine.

3961
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:49,480
Don't even sweat it.

3962
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:49,760
Okay.

3963
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:51,460
What was that?

3964
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,000
Oh, shit!

3965
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:52,900
Guys, guys, I need your help.

3966
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:53,380
I need your help.

3967
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:53,800
I need your help.

3968
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:54,240
I need your help.

3969
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:54,640
I need your help.

3970
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:56,520
What the fuck just happened?

3971
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,540
I got you.

3972
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:59,160
I saw you flying away.

3973
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,720
Yeah, I got... I got caught by the guy.

3974
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:04,760
I saw you flying away.

3975
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:05,980
Is there a gas tank on top of here?

3976
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:08,640
I'm loading.

3977
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:09,400
How do we get that?

3978
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:10,260
Oh, no.

3979
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,160
Her... Oh, god.

3980
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:11,700
Woody, hello.

3981
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:12,500
How do we get that?

3982
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:14,820
It's okay.

3983
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:15,500
We only got...

3984
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,040
After this, we only need four more guys.

3985
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:18,800
We're, like, pretty much almost done.

3986
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:22,340
Let's stick together.

3987
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,580
Let's stick together, gamer girls.

3988
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:23,940
Let's stick together, gamer girls.

3989
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,640
Do not blow up the gas tank.

3990
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:27,780
What gas tank?

3991
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,860
Where is... Oh, I see it.

3992
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:29,420
I'm gonna get it.

3993
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,200
I'm gonna load it.

3994
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:30,680
I'm gonna load it.

3995
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:31,660
Good job.

3996
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:32,500
Good job, Haru.

3997
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,740
Vile, vile, vile.

3998
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:42,880
Ality.

3999
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,620
Alright, I'm gonna stay up here.

4000
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:46,820
I think I have...

4001
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:47,840
Yeah, I do not think it's hot.

4002
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:49,080
Where's all the gas?

4003
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:51,240
Okay, Mint.

4004
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,140
Yeah.

4005
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:53,420
Uh...

4006
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:54,860
Uh-oh.

4007
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:55,800
Here it comes.

4008
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:57,460
Metal Gear Ray.

4009
01:57:58,600 --> 01:57:59,960
Mint, let's follow Hanya.

4010
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,160
Okay.

4011
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:01,920
Right here, right here.

4012
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:02,640
Okay, I'm coming.

4013
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:03,540
Oh, wait.

4014
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:04,020
I gotta heal.

4015
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,040
I'm gonna heal.

4016
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:08,360
If you'll cover for me, Mata, I'm gonna heal real quick.

4017
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,060
Oh, wait, wait.

4018
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,240
Hanya, you're alone.

4019
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:11,720
Be careful.

4020
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:12,920
Okay.

4021
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:13,760
Okay, I'm coming.

4022
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,100
We're coming.

4023
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:15,680
Not this way.

4024
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,220
Not this way.

4025
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:16,880
This way.

4026
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:17,180
This way.

4027
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:17,420
This way.

4028
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:17,820
Which way?

4029
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:18,680
Let's help Haru.

4030
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:20,620
Let's help Haru.

4031
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:21,260
Let's help Haru.

4032
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:23,380
Haha.

4033
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,660
Solo the tank.

4034
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,460
Solo the tank.

4035
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:27,800
Solo the tank.

4036
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,940
Let me solo the tank.

4037
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,380
Solo the tank.

4038
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,060
Oh.

4039
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,180
Oh my god.

4040
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:38,230
Ouch.

4041
01:58:38,770 --> 01:58:39,250
Ouch.

4042
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:39,750
Ouch.

4043
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:40,050
Ouch.

4044
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:40,310
Ouch.

4045
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:41,250
Ouch.

4046
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:41,610
Ouch.

4047
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:44,070
Oh, fack.

4048
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:45,150
I didn't realized it was a big guy.

4049
01:58:45,230 --> 01:58:46,030
I thought he was dead.

4050
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:47,710
He's dead?

4051
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:50,970
Oh, my gosh.

4052
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:52,050
You got her?

4053
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:58,710
Hanya, take the drugs for help.

4054
01:58:59,990 --> 01:59:01,210
Wait, she's not up yet.

4055
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:02,330
I'm not up yet.

4056
01:59:03,410 --> 01:59:07,170
Guys, we only need 3 more.

4057
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:08,230
How we can

4058
01:59:11,690 --> 01:59:12,350
We can try.

4059
01:59:12,370 --> 01:59:13,090
Let's go all together.

4060
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:14,150
Where is it?

4061
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:16,070
There's two over there in the back.

4062
01:59:16,910 --> 01:59:18,210
Oh, how do we get up there?

4063
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:20,070
I think over here, no?

4064
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:21,730
Wait, wait, somebody's alone.

4065
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:23,990
Yeah, where Haru is.

4066
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:25,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4067
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:25,730
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

4068
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:27,030
We can go there.

4069
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:27,870
Okay, perfect.

4070
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:33,890
I think now if we stay together and use drugs for health, I think we might get it.

4071
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:36,130
I think it's this way, this way, this way.

4072
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:37,530
I think we have to go...

4073
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:38,270
Oh, this way?

4074
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:38,930
This way, this way.

4075
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:40,310
Follow where Hennye is.

4076
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:41,330
They're coming from the stairs behind.

4077
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:43,430
Oh, goodness gracious.

4078
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:44,850
Spooked me.

4079
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:48,170
I'm kind of slow, so I'll guard from the back.

4080
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:49,050
I'm sticking back with Mint.

4081
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:50,890
I'm a little slow.

4082
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:52,150
It's okay, baby.

4083
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:53,750
Guys, there's two tanks over... not two tanks.

4084
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:54,870
Yeah, yeah, we're coming, we're coming, we're coming.

4085
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:56,430
Okay, okay.

4086
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:58,430
I'll grab one of them.

4087
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:01,430
Yeah, since Mint is slow.

4088
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:03,270
Or...

4089
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:04,130
I got it, I got it, I got it.

4090
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:06,190
Guys, there's pills here if anybody needs.

4091
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:08,810
There's a gas!

4092
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:13,100
I got you!

4093
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:15,340
Hennye, I'm gonna give you pills.

4094
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:17,180
Thank you.

4095
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:18,720
No, no, no.

4096
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,180
Oh, my God.

4097
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:19,840
Hennye, wait.

4098
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:20,520
Stop for a second.

4099
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:21,220
Okay.

4100
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:23,060
I'm gonna die, but that's okay.

4101
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:24,140
I need help.

4102
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:24,940
Hennye, behind you.

4103
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:25,380
Behind you.

4104
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:26,860
Thank you.

4105
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:27,500
Arigatou gozaimasu.

4106
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:28,080
Oh, my God.

4107
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:28,880
I was so close to...

4108
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,480
Did I finish?

4109
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,260
I don't even know.

4110
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,280
Oh, Mint, Mint, Mint, Mint.

4111
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:31,640
No!

4112
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:32,320
I was so close!

4113
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,480
Mint, if you need to ask, then you didn't finish.

4114
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:36,820
That's true.

4115
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:40,600
There's a smoker, by the way.

4116
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,140
Be careful.

4117
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,380
Guys, I'm running down to get Mint.

4118
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:44,740
I'm trying my best, but I am alone.

4119
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:45,960
Oh, sorry.

4120
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:46,260
That's you.

4121
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:46,620
Oh, fuck.

4122
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:47,080
I got tongue.

4123
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:47,480
Thank you, Haru.

4124
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:47,980
I got tongue.

4125
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:49,240
Ice cream.

4126
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,240
Thank you, Haru.

4127
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:51,480
Ice cream coming in.

4128
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:52,920
Arigatou.

4129
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:54,180
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out.

4130
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:55,900
I can't get them from behind you.

4131
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:56,120
I'm doing my best, Mint.

4132
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:56,180
I'm doing my best.

4133
02:00:57,540 --> 02:00:58,340
I'm leaving them.

4134
02:00:58,820 --> 02:00:59,460
Be careful.

4135
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:00,260
Don't shoot the barrel.

4136
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:00,660
I know.

4137
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:01,700
I'm putting it in.

4138
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,500
I don't care if I die.

4139
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,560
I got it.

4140
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:03,960
Mint, Mint, Mint.

4141
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:04,540
I got it.

4142
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:05,240
I can give you pills.

4143
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,020
I can give you drugs.

4144
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,100
I'm stuck.

4145
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,600
Oh, my gosh.

4146
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,380
I was getting teabagged for real.

4147
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:17,200
Stop it.

4148
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:19,840
It's okay.

4149
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:20,720
We're so close.

4150
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:21,380
There's one more.

4151
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:22,300
Just get it.

4152
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:23,600
Don't even worry about me.

4153
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:24,400
Just put it in.

4154
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:24,900
Shut up, Mint.

4155
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,860
We need your extra firepower, you bitch.

4156
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:30,440
Haru, I'm behind you.

4157
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:30,880
I'm behind you.

4158
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,600
Let's get the last one.

4159
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:32,180
There's one more?

4160
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,320
Yeah.

4161
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:33,960
Let's get one more.

4162
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:34,420
Come on, girls.

4163
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:34,980
Oh, my God.

4164
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:35,840
We literally are about to win.

4165
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:37,420
We're about to win the game.

4166
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:39,920
Oh, big guy.

4167
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:40,200
Big guy.

4168
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:40,460
Big guy.

4169
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:40,580
Big guy.

4170
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:40,700
Big guy.

4171
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:40,780
Big guy.

4172
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:41,160
Get the big guy.

4173
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,000
Go, big guy.

4174
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:43,560
Get the big guy.

4175
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:43,580
Get the big guy.

4176
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:45,380
Where's the last one?

4177
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:46,120
Oh, my God.

4178
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:46,640
He's going upstairs.

4179
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:48,900
Fuck.

4180
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,060
I thought that would avoid the shot.

4181
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,500
I went the wrong way.

4182
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,320
I went the wrong way.

4183
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:55,160
Fuck.

4184
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:55,880
Oh, no.

4185
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:56,860
Oh, no....

4186
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,280
Where's the...?

4187
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:07,000
Where's the...?

4188
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,100
Where's Rey?

4189
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,460
I have a... I have a... bomb!

4190
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:14,880
I'm not afraid to use it!

4191
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:16,300
Is this guy still damaged?

4192
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:16,300
Yes.

4193
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:16,860
HENYA!

4194
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:17,640
HENYA, I'M COMING!

4195
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:18,560
THANK YOU!

4196
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:24,160
I'm a little slow though.

4197
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:24,760
THANK YOU!

4198
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:25,240
THANK YOU!

4199
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:27,560
HENYA!

4200
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:28,460
WAIT!

4201
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:28,680
WAIT!

4202
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:29,360
I'M SORRY!

4203
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:29,900
I'M SORRY!

4204
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:30,340
OH MY GOSH!

4205
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:30,760
NO!

4206
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:31,280
IT'S OKAY!

4207
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:31,660
IT'S OKAY!

4208
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:34,800
HENYA!

4209
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,380
I... I...

4210
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:35,900
HENYA!

4211
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:36,560
I DON'T THINK I CAN...

4212
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:36,880
HENYA!

4213
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:37,620
I'M DOWN TOO!

4214
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:38,980
IT'S FINE!

4215
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:39,460
IT'S FINE!

4216
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:40,820
I'LL GET YOU GUYS!

4217
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:41,520
GIVE ME... OH!

4218
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:42,320

YOU GOT THIS!

4226
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:52,760

4228
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,080
I'M DEAD DEAD!

4229

NO, IT'S HARU!

4234
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:04,360
NO, AND IF SHE CAN GET YOU...

4235
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,340
IF SHE CAN GET YOU OUT...

4236
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:06,760
YOU GOT...

4237
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:07,420
NICE!

4238
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:07,900
NICE!

4239
02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:08,380
OH!

4240
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,840
HARU, I CAN'T SEE BEHIND YOU!

4241
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:10,380
OH MY... OH MY...

4242
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:11,340
BEHIND YOU!

4243
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:11,500
BEHIND YOU!

4244
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:11,840
BEHIND YOU!

4245
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,120
BEHIND YOU!

4246
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:12,440
BEHIND YOU!

4247
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:14,640
OKAY, LET'S SEE WHERE'S THE BOMB.

4248
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:14,660
OH!

4249
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:15,400
HARU, YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN...

4250
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:16,900
I HAD A BOMB!

4251
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,960
I HAD A BOMB, IF YOU NEED IT!

4252
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:20,680
YOU COULD GRAB IT FROM MY DEAD BODY!

4253
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:22,000
PEEL IT FROM MY HANDS!

4254
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:22,940
MY COLD MIND!

4255
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:25,160
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HARU IS.

4256
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:25,940
OKAY, SHE'S BEHIND ME.

4257
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:26,400
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

4258
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:28,340
OKAY, HARU?

4259
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:29,780
HOW ARE WE DOING THIS?

4260
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:32,020
WE GOTTA GET UP THERE.

4261
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:32,660
GO!

4262
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:33,660
INCOMING!

4263
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:34,540
OH, WATCH OUT!

4264
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:36,600
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO FROM THERE.

4265
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:36,860
FUCK!

4266
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,720
OH MY GOD.

4267
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:40,580
SHE'S CORNERED.

4268
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,200
SHE'S CORNERED.

4269
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:44,300
SHE'S NOT CORNERED.

4270
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,880
YOU HAVE TO GO FIRST FLOOR AND TIP THAT OTHER STAGE.

4271
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,720
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS UNHURT.

4272
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:49,700
IS THAT A JOCKY?

4273
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:50,320
OH NO.

4274
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:52,840
OH, HARU!

4275
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,020
GOOD LUCK!

4276
02:03:57,570 --> 02:03:58,490
SHE'S SO STRONG!

4277
02:03:58,510 --> 02:03:59,530
I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO DO IT.

4278
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:01,910
I GENUINELY THINK NEXT ROUND IS THE ROUND, GIRL.

4279
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:03,090
WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN NEXT ROUND?

4280
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:05,190
WE'RE STILL, WE STILL HAVE HERE!

4281
02:04:06,030 --> 02:04:06,810
OH GOSH.

4282
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:06,950
YEAH!

4283
02:04:07,090 --> 02:04:08,170
WE JUST GOT, UH OH.

4284
02:04:08,290 --> 02:04:09,110
THE ICE CREAM.

4285
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:13,650
HARU WITH THE PISTOL, MY QUEEN.

4286
02:04:16,070 --> 02:04:18,350
I GENUINELY THINK, LIKE, WE'RE ABOUT TO DO IT.

4287
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:18,910
OH, BEHIND YOU!

4288
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:21,810
WE CAN TAKE, LIKE, A TWO MINUTE BREAK.

4289
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:22,590
RECENTER.

4290
02:04:23,530 --> 02:04:24,010
PEACE.

4291
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:24,870
PEACE.

4292
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:26,290
OH MY GIRL.

4293
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:27,450
OH MY GIRL.

4294
02:04:27,450 --> 02:04:28,150
OH MY GIRL.

4295
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,410
WHOA!

4296
02:04:28,590 --> 02:04:29,070
WHOA!

4297
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:29,850
WHY ARE THEY PURPLE?

4298
02:04:30,030 --> 02:04:30,270
NICE!

4299
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:30,710
NICE!

4300
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:32,350
GOOD JOB, HARU.

4301
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:34,070
MY QUEEN.

4302
02:04:34,150 --> 02:04:35,190
SHE IS SO...

4303
02:04:35,190 --> 02:04:36,410
IMAGINE SHE CLUTCHES IT.

4304
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:37,310
SHE'S SO GOOD.

4305
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:38,310
OH NO!

4306
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:39,870
NO!

4307
02:04:40,190 --> 02:04:40,530
NO!

4308
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:41,750
SHE GOT CAUGHT!

4309
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:42,470
OH MY GOSH.

4310
02:04:42,610 --> 02:04:44,330
MATARA, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT?

4311
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,550
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT?

4312
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,950
SHE GOT CAUGHT.

4313
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:47,930
NO!

4314
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:49,090
IMAGINE IF SHE CLUTCHES.

4315
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:51,410
GETS IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT BY THE SOMA.

4316
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:52,670
NO!

4317
02:04:53,350 --> 02:04:55,050
I'M DOING SO WELL TOO!

4318
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:57,210
YOU REALLY DID REALLY WELL THAT TIME.

4319
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:58,050
HERE'S AN IDEA.

4320
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:01,370
CAN WE TAKE, LIKE, A TWO MINUTE BREAK?

4321
02:05:01,550 --> 02:05:04,350
AND JUST, LIKE, RECENTER OUR CHAKRAS?

4322
02:05:04,690 --> 02:05:06,410
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET THE NEXT ONE.

4323
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:06,930
ARE YOU OKAY?

4324
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:08,710
ARE YOU OKAY?

4325
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:09,530
ARE YOU OKAY, MATARA?

4326
02:05:10,190 --> 02:05:12,150
I NEED JUST, LIKE, A TWO MINUTE BREATHER.

4327
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:13,410
AND THEN I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

4328
02:05:13,450 --> 02:05:13,750
OKAY.

4329
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:14,750
TWO MINUTE BREATHER FOR YOU.

4330
02:05:15,070 --> 02:05:16,310
YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

4331
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:17,910
I JUST NEED, LIKE, TWO MINUTES.

4332
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:19,410
BECAUSE THAT WAS REALLY OVERWHELMING.

4333
02:05:19,450 --> 02:05:19,490
OKAY.

4334
02:05:19,490 --> 02:05:21,350
THIS STAGE IS SO STINKY.

4335
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:23,270
BUT IT WAS FUN.

4336
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:24,450
I THINK WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO GET IT.

4337
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:24,490
STINKY.

4338
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:25,110
STINKY.

4339
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:25,690
GENUINELY.

4340
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:29,810
I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD THING GOING WITH, LIKE, THROWING EVERYTHING DOWN IN, LIKE, TWO BIG WAVES.

4341
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:31,150
HAVING TEAMMATES.

4342
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:32,630
LIKE, I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

4343
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:35,930
I LIKE PUTTING IN THE GAS.

4344
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:39,370
THE BILE REALLY SAVED MY ASS FOR A BIT, BUT THEN THE FUCKING SMOKER GOT ME.

4345
02:05:39,370 --> 02:05:39,790
I KNOW!

4346
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:41,590
YOU CAN BLAME MATARA.

4347
02:05:41,630 --> 02:05:42,110
IT'S OKAY.

4348
02:05:42,110 --> 02:05:44,210
YOU CAN SAY, MATARA, WHY WOULD YOU JINX IT LIKE THAT?

4349
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:45,850
MATARA, THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

4350
02:05:45,890 --> 02:05:46,890
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

4351
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:47,930
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

4352
02:05:48,230 --> 02:05:50,150
I'M GONNA SPANK YOU WITH THIS YOWIE PADDLE.

4353
02:05:50,230 --> 02:05:50,710
TURN AROUND.

4354
02:05:50,770 --> 02:05:51,490
TURN AROUND.

4355
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:52,030
OKAY.

4356
02:05:52,030 --> 02:05:52,210
OKAY.

4357
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:52,590
SPANK ME.

4358
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:55,150
THIS IS, LIKE, REMINISCENT OF ANIME CONS.

4359
02:05:55,390 --> 02:05:56,130
TURN AROUND.

4360
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:57,050
ARE YOU GONNA GLOMP ME?

4361
02:05:57,330 --> 02:05:58,210
I'M TURNING AROUND.

4362
02:05:58,270 --> 02:05:58,970
I'M TURNING AROUND.

4363
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:04,160
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

4364
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:07,620
LET ME LOWER MY SENSITIVITY.

4365
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:09,860
I FEEL LIKE MY SENSITIVITY IS SO HIGH.

4366
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:11,040
OKAY.

4367
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:11,400
OKAY.

4368
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:13,600
JIMMY GIBBS JUNIOR IS THE MAN.

4369
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,300
THE MAN.

4370
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,120
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY LIKE THAT, MAN.

4371
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:17,100
MAN.

4372
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:18,300
MAN.

4373
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,340
MAN.

4374
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:19,800
MAN.

4375
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,100
BIRD TRAX.

4376
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:21,640
THE MAN.

4377
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:24,020
THE LEGEND.

4378
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,300
THE LEGEND.

4379
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:25,480
THE LEGEND.

4380
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:29,100
OH, YEAH.

4381
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:32,680
CAN WE PLEASE ADD THE CLASSIC EMOTE IN MY CHANNEL?

4382
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:33,960
WHAT'S THAT?

4383
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:35,300
HAG BANGING TO THE MUSIC.

4384
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:37,120
IT'S LIKE THE LITTLE DUCK SMOKING.

4385
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:37,440
WAIT.

4386
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,740
HOW DO YOU DO THE EMOTES IN THIS?

4387
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,020
HOW DO YOU DO THE EMOTES?

4388
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:43,200
IN TWITCH, YOU JUST TYPE IN AND THEN IT SHOWS UP.

4389
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,080
IN THIS GAME.

4390
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:46,140
NO, I HAVE CLASSIC.

4391
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:46,840
DANCING DA YO.

4392
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,480
HOW DO YOU DO THEM, GUYS?

4393
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:51,220
I DID IT WRONG.

4394
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:51,980
YOU SUCK.

4395
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:56,660
THERE'S STILL A MEDPACK HERE IF ANYONE WANTS IT.

4396
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:59,980
I THINK SOMEBODY WITH LOW HEALTH SHOULD USE IT AND THEN GRAB.

4397
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:00,260
OH, WAIT.

4398
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:01,600
I DIDN'T HAVE AN EXTRA MEDPACK.

4399
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:01,940
MY BAD.

4400
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:02,740
I'M STUPID.

4401
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:04,120
I HAVE AN EXTRA.

4402
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:04,940
NO.

4403
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,780
WE ALL HAVE ONE MEDPACK, RIGHT?

4404
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:07,660
OKAY.

4405
02:07:07,660 --> 02:07:07,980
ZEE?

4406
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:08,240
OH, NO.

4407
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:09,240
HOW DID THEY NOT HAVE IT?

4408
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:09,840
OH, THIS IS IT.

4409
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:10,040
OH.

4410
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:11,600
HOW DID THEY NOT HAVE IT?

4411
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,540
HOW DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?

4412
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:13,280
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

4413
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,100
Oh, I saw emote.

4414
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:14,880
GRAB THE ONE DOWNSTAIRS, THOUGH.

4415
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:15,260
WE'RE FINE.

4416
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:17,480

4417
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:18,160

02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:26,760
BE LIKE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES.

4425
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:26,940
WHAT HAPPENED?

4426
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:29,880
IMAGINE PUTTING IN THE 13TH GAS CAN AND CHEERING.

4427
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:30,320
HOO-RA.

4428
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:31,760
SORRY.

4429
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:32,100

02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:33,880

4434
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:35,500
OH, NAH.

4435
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,700
ARE YOU MANIFESTING?

4436
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:43,880
You have to do it.

4437
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:46,740
You have to be happy as if we just won.

4438
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:50,820
Not the Garfield scratch.

4439
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:55,140
Listen, the clutch that I made...

4440
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:57,740
and then you have to jinx it for me.

4441
02:07:57,940 --> 02:07:59,060
Sorry, I was sneezing.

4442
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,860
Can you just pretend to be so happy that we won?

4443
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:05,960
Just imagine we win.

4444
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:07,740
Yay!

4445
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:09,240
No, more!

4446
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:10,840
Let's go!

4447
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:11,600
Yay!

4448
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:13,060
Yay!

4449
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:14,420
Let's go!

4450
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:15,860
Alright, let's go.

4451
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:21,720
If we lose, it's because of Hena's power of imagination.

4452
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:25,220
You do not blame Hena for your own skill issue.

4453
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:25,960
Come on!

4454
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:28,080
No, I blame Hena if we lose.

4455
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:28,440
Sorry.

4456
02:08:28,700 --> 02:08:38,400
I saw you on the kills board.

4457
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:39,980
Every time.

4458
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:40,940
Yeah?

4459
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,300
Don't you skill-issue-dayo me, baby girl.

4460
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,020
It's a ping!

4461
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,360
I live in Japan!

4462
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:51,200
Wait, Hena, did you just say ping?

4463
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:52,760
It's a ping-dayo!

4464
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,900
Real gamers don't blame the ping!

4465
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:56,480
It's a ping-issue-dayo!

4466
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:58,240
It's a ping!

4467
02:08:58,740 --> 02:08:59,980
Ping-issue-dayo.

4468
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,040
Ping-issue-dayo.

4469
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:02,440
It's a ping-issue-dayo!

4470
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,520
I saw you on the scoreboard, Hena.

4471
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:07,460
I know what you do in your spare time.

4472
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:10,820
Why will you move to Japan so we can play with you?

4473
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:11,180
Same thing.

4474
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:12,360
Okay.

4475
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:12,860
Yeah, Hena.

4476
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:14,940
She was talking to me.

4477
02:09:15,860 --> 02:09:16,840
She was talking to me!

4478
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:19,820
I mean, too bad, you guys.

4479
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:20,680
I'm already married.

4480
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:22,420
So I technically know you guys from Hawaii.

4481
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:24,780
Don't fill it up now.

4482
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,460
We're filling them up after, right?

4483
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:28,380
I'll go get the other two over there.

4484
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:28,700
Alright, Hena.

4485
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:29,800
Yeah.

4486
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:30,660
Let's go.

4487
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:31,920
I got overzealous.

4488
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,060
I got overzealous a little bit.

4489
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:35,560
Should we go this way?

4490
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:36,480
Yeah, let's go this way.

4491
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:37,980
Yeah, the other way.

4492
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:38,700
The other way?

4493
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:38,760
Okay.

4494
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:39,880
There's two cans at the end.

4495
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:41,160
Which way?

4496
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:41,500
Oh, down here?

4497
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:44,180
Actually, let's keep the two cans on the floor for the end, actually.

4498
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:44,800
This one will be...

4499
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:45,440
These ones down here?

4500
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:46,280
Keep the two on the floor at the end.

4501
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:46,540
Yeah, yeah.

4502
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:47,360
They're the easiest to get.

4503
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:48,620
Charger!

4504
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:51,600
I'm here.

4505
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:51,920
I'm here.

4506
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:52,420
I'm here.

4507
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:52,660
I'm here.

4508
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:52,920
I'm here.

4509
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:53,180
I'm here.

4510
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:53,620
I'm here.

4511
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:57,640
Oh my gosh, how am I already so close to death?

4512
02:09:57,860 --> 02:09:58,420
This is so bad.

4513
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:02,880
Yeah I'm trying...

4514
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:10,500
Let's go up.

4515
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:11,000
Let's go up.

4516
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,940
Wait, can we get it from here?

4517
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:16,940
Are we here?

4518
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:17,920
We're going.

4519
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:19,340
Uh oh.

4520
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:20,260
What am I hearing?

4521
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:22,440
Bienvenido a Miami.

4522
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:23,140
Oh my gosh!

4523
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:23,900
Okay, I got him.

4524
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:24,320
We're okay.

4525
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,560
Oh, sorry.

4526
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:28,620
You scared me, you scared me.

4527
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:29,300
I got him.

4528
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:31,480
Hold on, let me get the pills.

4529
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:35,700
There's always pills upstairs, Mint, if you want some for the extra health.

4530
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:37,280
Did you grab both of them?

4531
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,640
No, there's another pill there if you want to grab it.

4532
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:40,460
Nice!

4533
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:43,860
Oh, get off of me.

4534
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:45,380
Grab the pill too.

4535
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:46,720
Yeah, I grabbed it.

4536
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,060
Wait, wait.

4537
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:48,720
There's two over here.

4538
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:51,100
Sorry, I'm just so used to going downstairs.

4539
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:53,060
Wait, are there any over here?

4540
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:54,320
I'm not near you.

4541
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:55,540
Are there any over here?

4542
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:56,520
Let's go check.

4543
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:58,600
Oh, I think this is how we get the ones over here.

4544
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:00,560
Oh, let's throw them.

4545
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:08,720
Oh, good girl.

4546
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:09,900
You did find them.

4547
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:13,540
Did you like the 360 roll throw?

4548
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:14,600
Nice!

4549
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:16,160
How did you do that?

4550
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:18,000
There's also bombs over here.

4551
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:19,240
How did you do the 360?

4552
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:21,620
There's bombs over there?

4553
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:21,840
Where?

4554
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:23,960
Down where the gas cans were.

4555
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:25,340
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

4556
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,560
Hold on, I just dropped my pistol.

4557
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:27,500
Okay, okay.

4558
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:28,980
I'm here, I'm here.

4559
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:29,440
Watch out, watch out.

4560
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:33,060
Okay.

4561
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:35,800
Sorry, I keep shooting you.

4562
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:36,240
Let's run around.

4563
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:38,020
Yeah, let's run around.

4564
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:38,960
Run back, run back.

4565
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:39,520
Do we?

4566
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:40,540
How many do we have?

4567
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:40,760
Okay.

4568
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:41,600
Oh, wait.

4569
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:43,480
There's just the ones on that story.

4570
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:44,300
And then...

4571
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:45,040
Yeah.

4572
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:45,660
Let's go back down.

4573
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:46,060
Okay.

4574
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:47,520
There's a lot on the floor.

4575
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:48,000
Yeah.

4576
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:48,960
I'm going to start loading.

4577
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:51,400
Maybe let's start blowing some up so we don't accidentally blow them up.

4578
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:52,080
No, there's a tank nearby.

4579
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:52,900
Oopsie.

4580
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:53,160
There's a tank.

4581
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:53,400
Okay.

4582
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:54,500
Let's kill the tank and then...

4583
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:55,420
Careful of the tank.

4584
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:57,200
If you can leave him...

4585
02:11:57,560 --> 02:12:00,280
Min, Min, Min, Min.

4586
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:00,680
Min, Min, Min, Min.

4587
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:01,120
Get back up.

4588
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:01,840
Back up?

4589
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,380
Or wait, wait.

4590
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:03,240
Let's kill the tank with him.

4591
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:04,680
I was trying to get it.

4592
02:12:04,700 --> 02:12:05,040
Oh, here.

4593
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:05,160
I see him.

4594
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:05,460
I see him.

4595
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:06,060
Bomb!

4596
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:07,100
Bomb's away!

4597
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:23,000
Thank you, Manta.

4598
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:23,760
Thank you.

4599
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:24,300
Oh my God.

4600
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:24,520
Welcome.

4601
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:25,580
Get a med kit while you can.

4602
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:27,180
I was reloading fucking forever.

4603
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:28,700
Get a med kit while you can.

4604
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:29,080
Me?

4605
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:29,960
Oh my God.

4606
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:30,240
Haru?

4607
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:30,760
No, no, no.

4608
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:31,020
Not you.

4609
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:31,640
Haru, Haru, Haru.

4610
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:32,780
Haru, I'm coming in a second.

4611
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:33,880
I have to kill the hunter first.

4612
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:34,380
Oh, God.

4613
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:36,820
I think we're not going to do so well this time.

4614
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:37,140
We're fine.

4615
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:37,620
We're fine.

4616
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:37,980
We're fine.

4617
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:38,880
Stop jinxing it.

4618
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:40,740
Don't jinx it.

4619
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:41,260
Don't jinx it.

4620
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:41,960
Oh my God.

4621
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:42,360
You harlot.

4622
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:46,640
Get him or get Haru.

4623
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:49,060
Thank you.

4624
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:50,940
We're fine.

4625
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:53,220
I think we need to load a few of these in the thingy.

4626
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:53,740
Huh?

4627
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:53,840
Hold on.

4628
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:54,620
I got you.

4629
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:55,240
I got you, Haru.

4630
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:55,760
Come here.

4631
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:55,960
Come here.

4632
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:56,760
Oh, no.

4633
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:57,960
I can just get this health kit over here.

4634
02:12:58,020 --> 02:12:58,200
Oh.

4635
02:12:58,200 --> 02:12:58,440
Yeah.

4636
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:00,260
Get the health kit and there's also meds and stuff.

4637
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:02,460
Oh, I actually need one now that I look at it.

4638
02:13:03,640 --> 02:13:04,220
Here you go.

4639
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:04,640
Take that.

4640
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:05,520
I'm going to take this one.

4641
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:09,180
And I'm just going to heal real quick while I wait.

4642
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:14,940
Okay.

4643
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,960
Watch not to blow them up now.

4644
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:17,480
Don't blow up.

4645
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:18,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4646
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,720
Watch out for that one over there.

4647
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:22,240
Reload in here.

4648
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:25,380
Fuck.

4649
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:25,640
Fuck.

4650
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:25,780
Fuck.

4651
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:26,500
I need help with the jumper.

4652
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:26,860
I'm coming.

4653
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:27,200
I'm coming.

4654
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:27,860
I got you.

4655
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:28,240
I got you.

4656
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:29,640
I got you.

4657
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:29,660
Oh, no.

4658
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:30,900
Good job.

4659
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:31,760
Oh, no, no.

4660
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:33,760
I'm on fire.

4661
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:34,260
Ahhh.

4662
02:13:34,540 --> 02:13:35,300
All of them?

4663
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:35,820
Fuck.

4664
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:37,160
Fine.

4665
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:39,660
I got you.

4666
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:41,540
There's still two over here.

4667
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:42,620
There's still two over here.

4668
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:45,700
Keep the two on the floor for the end because they're the easiest.

4669
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:47,700
Keep those two for the end because they're the easiest.

4670
02:13:47,780 --> 02:13:47,900
Okay.

4671
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:49,100
So it's going to be easiest to get them.

4672
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:49,340
Okay.

4673
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:50,380
I wonder what one's...

4674
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:50,840
Oh, no.

4675
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:51,880
The one's on the...

4676
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:53,180
Reloading.

4677
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:53,560
Oh, shoot.

4678
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,420
I didn't even notice.

4679
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,920
I should have reloaded earlier.

4680
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,380
Wait, who's alone?

4681
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,300
Haruka, you're alone.

4682
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,180
Don't worry, I'm just throwing this off.

4683
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:01,860
It's fine.

4684
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:05,140
Always try to go with a buddy just in case.

4685
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,180
Just in case you get, like, um...

4686
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:08,880
You're such a mom.

4687
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:13,180
You're such a mom.

4688
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:15,240
I can't hear you, Haru.

4689
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:15,560
Sorry.

4690
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:17,000
It's because I was shooting.

4691
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:18,800
I can't reload.

4692
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,200
Gotta get some more.

4693
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:22,260
I can't reload.

4694
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,340
I can't reload.

4695
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,100
There's two more in the first floor.

4696
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:27,020
We're saving those, Henya.

4697
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:27,820
We're gonna save them.

4698
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:30,820
Yeah, keep those until the end, Henya, because they're the easiest.

4699
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:35,300
They're the easiest to get, so we should keep them until the end of the game.

4700
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,520
I think that one is the one from over here, right?

4701
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:40,420
Okay, I'm gonna try and get this one over here.

4702
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:44,740
You can start bringing those two, Henya, actually, because we're pretty much at the end.

4703
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:45,500
We just need two more.

4704
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:47,180
No, we need four more.

4705
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:49,920
Yeah, and we're getting these four more, so don't worry.

4706
02:14:50,060 --> 02:14:51,120
Those two plus these two.

4707
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:53,380
Good job!

4708
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:55,180
I got one.

4709
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:56,600
Uh-oh.

4710
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:57,220
There's only one here?

4711
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:58,720
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

4712
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:00,700
That's what I'm saying!

4713
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:02,680
Wait, there's over here, though.

4714
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:03,060
Over here.

4715
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:03,860
Yeah, let's get the other one.

4716
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:06,060
Bring both of those two, just in case.

4717
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:08,640
Okay, I got it, I got it.

4718
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:09,800
Tank's here.

4719
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:10,780
I hear his music.

4720
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:11,780
He's blasting it again.

4721
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:12,360
Mate.

4722
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:15,780
Was there just one there, Mint, or two?

4723
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:16,320
Yeah, just one.

4724
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:16,660
Just one.

4725
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:17,320
Oh, fuck!

4726
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:19,240
I just dropped.

4727
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:19,660
You're alone.

4728
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:21,240
I accidentally fell through the floor.

4729
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:21,860
It's okay.

4730
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:23,660
I'm far.

4731
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:24,200
I'm far.

4732
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:24,940
I'm trying to kill a jockey.

4733
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:25,560
Oh, gosh.

4734
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:26,820
Okay, there's a guy.

4735
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:27,220
There's a guy.

4736
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:27,600
There's a guy.

4737
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,980
I'm gonna die, I think.

4738
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:30,400
Mint, I'm so sorry.

4739
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:31,340
I fell through the floor.

4740
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:34,280
How do I... Does it move this way?

4741
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,380
Or does it move on the...

4742
02:15:35,380 --> 02:15:36,820
Oh, gosh.

4743
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:39,860
Oh, he downed me.

4744
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:40,680
He downed me.

4745
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,300
Sorry, Mint.

4746
02:15:45,940 --> 02:15:46,480
It's okay.

4747
02:15:47,860 --> 02:15:48,540
I fell.

4748
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:49,380
It's okay.

4749
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,260
I'm just down, you know.

4750
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:52,200
Oh, you're also down.

4751
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:53,440
Cool.

4752
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:55,800
Mrs. Puff.

4753
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:57,880
Don't worry.

4754
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:58,580
I got you.

4755
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,260
I got you.

4756
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:01,260
Fucking...

4757
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:04,740
What do you think I am?

4758
02:16:07,250 --> 02:16:08,150
I'm not a feet man.

4759
02:16:08,150 --> 02:16:08,810
I'm gonna go get Mint.

4760
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:09,570
I'm gonna go get Mint.

4761
02:16:10,590 --> 02:16:11,310
I'm so slow.

4762
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:12,110
Hurry.

4763
02:16:13,850 --> 02:16:15,250
I'm back here again.

4764
02:16:18,110 --> 02:16:18,730
I'm here, Mint.

4765
02:16:18,730 --> 02:16:20,370
Oh, the... What's it called?

4766
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:22,310
Are you sure you're here?

4767
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:24,210
Because I'm literally blacking out.

4768
02:16:24,570 --> 02:16:25,830
Can you shoot them?

4769
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:26,950
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

4770
02:16:27,450 --> 02:16:28,130
Okay, good girl.

4771
02:16:28,290 --> 02:16:31,990
I think it got blown up, so let's grab the...

4772
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:33,410
Yeah, let's grab the other one.

4773
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:34,710
Oh, I hear him again.

4774
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:36,210
Oh, we just blew them up.

4775
02:16:36,330 --> 02:16:37,610
Sorry, I think I just blew them up.

4776
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:38,350
Behind you.

4777
02:16:38,590 --> 02:16:39,770
I was taking pills.

4778
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:42,370
My girl.

4779
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:46,630
Mint, there's one back there.

4780
02:16:47,010 --> 02:16:47,950
Oh, thank you.

4781
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:49,690
Thank you so much.

4782
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:51,750
Girls, how many...

4783
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:53,210
Oh, shit, you're alone.

4784
02:16:53,750 --> 02:16:55,110
How many do we have downstairs?

4785
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:58,290
It's these two that need to go.

4786
02:16:58,350 --> 02:16:58,970
Zero down here.

4787
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:01,570
Alright, hold on.

4788
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:02,650
They're gonna come out from here?

4789
02:17:02,950 --> 02:17:03,350
Yeah.

4790
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:04,670
Oh, and from here?

4791
02:17:04,810 --> 02:17:05,250
Oh, shoot.

4792
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:06,890
Oh, shoot.

4793
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:08,990
Oh, shoot.

4794
02:17:09,050 --> 02:17:09,890
Watch out, though.

4795
02:17:10,290 --> 02:17:11,470
Okay, I'm gonna throw it overboard.

4796
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:13,230
Yeah, get it, get it, get it.

4797
02:17:14,550 --> 02:17:15,350
Throwing gasoline!

4798
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:16,650
Thank you, thank you.

4799
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:20,030
We're gonna get the last one.

4800
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:22,170
We're gonna get the last one and we're done.

4801
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,290
We need two more.

4802
02:17:23,450 --> 02:17:25,110
Get the one we just threw on the floor.

4803
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:26,150
And we're done.

4804
02:17:26,290 --> 02:17:26,870
We beat the game.

4805
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:28,410
We beat the game.

4806
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:31,710
Throw the last one and then let's go help them.

4807
02:17:32,730 --> 02:17:33,810
We're coming, we're coming.

4808
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:35,130
We're coming, we're coming, we're coming.

4809
02:17:36,710 --> 02:17:38,210
Oh, gosh, they're right behind us.

4810
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,310
They're right behind us, yeah.

4811
02:17:40,490 --> 02:17:41,830
They're behind us, they're behind us.

4812
02:17:41,990 --> 02:17:43,670
Oh my goodness.

4813
02:17:45,030 --> 02:17:45,990
I'm coming to the car.

4814
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:46,430
I'm coming to the car.

4815
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:50,750
How do I get in?

4816
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:52,830
I don't know.

4817
02:17:53,150 --> 02:17:53,890
Let me in.

4818
02:17:54,990 --> 02:17:56,850
Come on, Matara, you're so slow.

4819
02:17:57,430 --> 02:17:58,230
Shut the fuck up!

4820
02:17:59,090 --> 02:17:59,510
There we go.

4821
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:01,690
Yippee!

4822
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:03,270
Yippee!

4823
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:06,790
Oh my gosh, Matara, we beat the whole game.

4824
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:07,350
How do you feel?

4825
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:08,610
Let's go!

4826
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:11,250
Isn't this only like round one of the whole game?

4827
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:11,550
Yeah.

4828
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:13,910
Actually...

4829
02:18:15,730 --> 02:18:17,910
I'm so sorry for swearing so much.

4830
02:18:17,970 --> 02:18:18,950
But that was amazing.

4831
02:18:19,330 --> 02:18:20,090
Oh my god.

4832
02:18:21,390 --> 02:18:22,070
Let's go!

4833
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:23,350
We did it!

4834
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:30,550
Oh, I used the least amount of first aid kit.

4835
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:31,730
No wonder I died the most.

4836
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:32,590
Oh...

4837
02:18:36,050 --> 02:18:37,150
Oh my god.

4838
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:38,410
Dang, Matara.

4839
02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:43,190
I was using melee until the beginning of the game.

4840
02:18:43,250 --> 02:18:43,510
Yeah.

4841
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:49,050
I killed all them tanks.

4842
02:18:49,670 --> 02:18:50,930
All them tanks.

4843
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,550
Oh no.

4844
02:18:52,150 --> 02:18:52,970
Don't look at that.

4845
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:54,170
We got it baby girl.

4846
02:18:55,450 --> 02:18:56,190
Don't look at that.

4847
02:18:56,190 --> 02:18:56,570
Don't look at that.

4848
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:57,670
Oh I took the least amount of damage?

4849
02:18:57,810 --> 02:18:58,490
Let's go.

4850
02:18:59,650 --> 02:19:01,250
Let's go friendly fire.

4851
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:03,230
Wait a second.

4852
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:05,430
Revive the most teammates though?

4853
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:05,970
Hello?

4854
02:19:06,350 --> 02:19:06,610
Yippee.

4855
02:19:08,810 --> 02:19:09,770
Accuracy 19%.

4856
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:12,650
Zombies no harm in the making of this film.

4857
02:19:12,650 --> 02:19:14,330
Oh I got the most headshots though.

4858
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:14,810
Nice.

4859
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:15,550
Nice.

4860
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:17,650
I don't aim for the head ever.

4861
02:19:17,870 --> 02:19:18,730
I just aim.

4862
02:19:19,090 --> 02:19:21,530
I know it's hard to in the moment right?

4863
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:22,310
Yeah.

4864
02:19:24,370 --> 02:19:25,730
That was amazing.

4865
02:19:26,490 --> 02:19:27,250
But exhausting.

4866
02:19:27,790 --> 02:19:30,050
That's just a taste of how your tournament will be.

4867
02:19:32,890 --> 02:19:34,030
How do you feel?

4868
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:34,470
I'm not ready.

4869
02:19:34,870 --> 02:19:35,670
Not ready.

4870
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:35,870
When is it?

4871
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:37,190
I feel like I was not prepared.

4872
02:19:37,310 --> 02:19:38,030
Like end of May?

4873
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:39,370
Oh.

4874
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:40,610
Yeah.

4875
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:41,290
Good luck.

4876
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:42,930
No.

4877
02:19:43,810 --> 02:19:44,250
No.

4878
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:44,550
No.

4879
02:19:44,550 --> 02:19:44,730
No.

4880
02:19:44,730 --> 02:19:44,870
No.

4881
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:46,170
Oh it's the end of May?

4882
02:19:46,830 --> 02:19:47,270
Yeah.

4883
02:19:48,330 --> 02:19:48,770
Arigato.

4884
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:51,450
Do we keep going or do we stop here?

4885
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:52,330
Up to you guys.

4886
02:19:52,690 --> 02:19:55,430
I feel like I can keep going.

4887
02:19:55,950 --> 02:19:56,590
So yeah.

4888
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:57,330
Up to you guys.

4889
02:19:57,570 --> 02:19:59,270
I could stop or I could go.

4890
02:19:59,590 --> 02:20:02,310
I think it's you know if anybody's too tired.

4891
02:20:03,150 --> 02:20:06,330
Is the first mission the hardest?

4892
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:11,910
Does it get easier?

4893
02:20:12,650 --> 02:20:13,030
I don't know.

4894
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:17,430
We could also choose like anyone.

4895
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:19,230
We don't have to do like the second one.

4896
02:20:19,330 --> 02:20:22,850
We can choose any anyone that we want.

4897
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:24,070
The second one says streets.

4898
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:25,010
Yeah.

4899
02:20:25,210 --> 02:20:26,590
Like the carnival one.

4900
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:28,150
Well the carnival one is kind of annoying too.

4901
02:20:28,850 --> 02:20:30,170
Oh it's because I have the campaign.

4902
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:31,610
Death center, passing.

4903
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:33,610
They want us to do dark carnival.

4904
02:20:34,330 --> 02:20:35,690
How about blood harvest?

4905
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:37,290
Blood harvest?

4906
02:20:38,130 --> 02:20:39,270
Or the passing.

4907
02:20:39,450 --> 02:20:40,110
Hard rain.

4908
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:41,810
Dead air.

4909
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:42,730
No mercy.

4910
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:43,210
The sacrifice.

4911
02:20:45,050 --> 02:20:46,230
There's also the concert.

4912
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:46,930
What sounds interesting?

4913
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:48,770
Dark carnival my beloved.

4914
02:20:49,210 --> 02:20:50,250
Is that actually?

4915
02:20:50,370 --> 02:20:51,030
I think they don't.

4916
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:52,090
I think it might be smart.

4917
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:55,130
I don't know.

4918
02:20:55,130 --> 02:20:58,270
Okay I'll read out a few names and you girls say what you prefer.

4919
02:20:58,570 --> 02:20:59,290
The passing.

4920
02:20:59,770 --> 02:21:00,830
Dark carnival.

4921
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:02,050
Swamp fever.

4922
02:21:02,430 --> 02:21:03,250
Hard rain.

4923
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:04,270
The parish.

4924
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:05,250
The sacrifice.

4925
02:21:05,650 --> 02:21:06,530
No mercy.

4926
02:21:06,890 --> 02:21:07,770
Crash course.

4927
02:21:07,770 --> 02:21:08,950
Death toll.

4928
02:21:09,130 --> 02:21:09,970
Dead air.

4929
02:21:10,270 --> 02:21:11,210
Blood harvest.

4930
02:21:11,410 --> 02:21:12,130
Cold stream.

4931
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:13,130
The last sand.

4932
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:18,450
Dark carnival.

4933
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:19,870
Alright.

4934
02:21:20,850 --> 02:21:22,630
Oh people are saying the carnival is hardest.

4935
02:21:23,650 --> 02:21:25,770
Why are people saying the carnival is hardest?

4936
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:27,570
Maybe I just saw one person.

4937
02:21:27,730 --> 02:21:27,990
Carnival.

4938
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:28,790
Carnival.

4939
02:21:29,010 --> 02:21:31,430
Well people are saying no mercy is quick for Alaskan.

4940
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:32,810
Oh is it?

4941
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:34,090
Yeah we can do anything.

4942
02:21:34,270 --> 02:21:35,550
I'm fine with anything.

4943
02:21:35,910 --> 02:21:36,810
I'm just reading chat.

4944
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:37,930
No mercy or dark carnival?

4945
02:21:39,710 --> 02:21:39,930
Oh.

4946
02:21:40,490 --> 02:21:43,310
People are saying no mercy and the carnival is a good one.

4947
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:45,070
Yeah that's what I'm saying too.

4948
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:49,270
I don't think I've done no mercy.

4949
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:50,330
I don't know though.

4950
02:21:51,550 --> 02:21:52,470
Alright no mercy.

4951
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:55,610
Haruka I see you.

4952
02:21:56,470 --> 02:21:57,850
Wait what's she doing?

4953
02:21:58,810 --> 02:22:00,130
She's calling me stinky.

4954
02:22:03,030 --> 02:22:05,650
Oh no I didn't download anymore.

4955
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:07,510
What do you mean?

4956
02:22:08,110 --> 02:22:08,790
The mods.

4957
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:10,090
No.

4958
02:22:11,070 --> 02:22:11,630
Aww.

4959
02:22:13,730 --> 02:22:14,750
Are you okay?

4960
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:16,670
Yeah oh there's a chat.

4961
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:18,330
Huh?

4962
02:22:18,570 --> 02:22:19,530
Yeah there is.

4963
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:23,350
Yeah don't say mean things.

4964
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:25,190
Say nice things.

4965
02:22:25,450 --> 02:22:26,470
It says say JP.

4966
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:27,670
What does it mean by that?

4967
02:22:28,010 --> 02:22:29,670
Don't say mean things in the chat.

4968
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:30,730
Say JP.

4969
02:22:31,890 --> 02:22:33,290
Is it a cheat code?

4970
02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:36,910
Oh it's gonna like unlock secret weapons.

4971
02:22:37,990 --> 02:22:39,090
Oh oh oh.

4972
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:40,730
It says JP to me too.

4973
02:22:40,970 --> 02:22:41,190
Oh.

4974
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:43,590
JP.

4975
02:22:44,610 --> 02:22:45,410
Alright I'm starting.

4976
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:45,870
Okay.

4977
02:22:48,490 --> 02:22:50,590
I'm gonna need a drink after this game I think.

4978
02:22:52,270 --> 02:22:55,190
I didn't think we'd be playing as the Left 4 Dead 1 people.

4979
02:22:55,370 --> 02:22:57,090
So I didn't download any of their mods.

4980
02:22:57,930 --> 02:22:59,450
The Left 4 Dead 1 guy?

4981
02:22:59,570 --> 02:23:01,010
I thought he was from Dead by Daylight.

4982
02:23:01,150 --> 02:23:02,550
I didn't realize he was from this game.

4983
02:23:02,810 --> 02:23:03,110
Which one?

4984
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:03,650
The one with the hat?

4985
02:23:03,970 --> 02:23:04,590
The old one.

4986
02:23:04,770 --> 02:23:04,970
Yeah.

4987
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,490
Yeah.

4988
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:08,470
He's in Dead by Daylight.

4989
02:23:08,590 --> 02:23:09,350
Dead by Daylight?

4990
02:23:09,350 --> 02:23:10,010
I think his name is Bill.

4991
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:11,230
Yeah I think so.

4992
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:11,890
That's fun.

4993
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:12,690
Really?

4994
02:23:13,030 --> 02:23:13,850
That's cool.

4995
02:23:14,350 --> 02:23:15,010
Thank you.

4996
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:16,590
Look at Billy.

4997
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:17,950
Dude.

4998
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:21,230
What?

4999
02:23:21,330 --> 02:23:25,590
Sorry we're all humans and then Henya is like Silver the Hedgehog.

5000
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:28,390
I am.

5001
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:29,510
Yeah you.

5002
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:34,970
My brain is fucking up.

5003
02:23:35,210 --> 02:23:35,590
It's okay.

5004
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:38,050
It's okay.

5005
02:23:38,330 --> 02:23:38,970
Wake up.

5006
02:23:39,070 --> 02:23:39,870
Wake up.

5007
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:40,690
Wake up.

5008
02:23:40,730 --> 02:23:42,030
Grab a brush and put on a little makeup.

5009
02:23:44,830 --> 02:23:46,350
I don't think you trust.

5010
02:23:48,570 --> 02:23:49,310
Your money.

5011
02:23:49,430 --> 02:23:49,910
Your money.

5012
02:23:49,910 --> 02:23:51,030
That's what my friend wanted to say.

5013
02:23:51,130 --> 02:23:51,370
Your money.

5014
02:23:57,410 --> 02:23:57,810
What's here?

5015
02:24:06,910 --> 02:24:08,610
I didn't bring a health pack with me.

5016
02:24:08,770 --> 02:24:09,470
You know what?

5017
02:24:09,550 --> 02:24:09,830
I'm a gamer.

5018
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:10,150
I don't need it.

5019
02:24:10,150 --> 02:24:10,570
Go get it.

5020
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:11,490
Go get it.

5021
02:24:11,490 --> 02:24:12,210
I don't need one.

5022
02:24:14,450 --> 02:24:14,870
Gamer.

5023
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:15,290
Gamer.

5024
02:24:15,570 --> 02:24:15,990
Gamer.

5025
02:24:18,070 --> 02:24:19,590
Do we go down?

5026
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:21,630
I think we go downstairs.

5027
02:24:21,650 --> 02:24:23,350
This kind of reminds me of Half-Life.

5028
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:27,470
There's a Half-Life VR.

5029
02:24:27,630 --> 02:24:28,630
I don't know if you saw Henya.

5030
02:24:29,390 --> 02:24:31,390
Oh yeah but I get motion sickness.

5031
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:31,910
That's hard.

5032
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:33,930
Wish I could.

5033
02:24:34,110 --> 02:24:34,750
Wish I could.

5034
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:35,630
What happened over here?

5035
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:37,670
Uh oh.

5036
02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:38,550
I can't see anything.

5037
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:40,130
What's the best gun?

5038
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:42,530
Is it still the AK here or is it another gun y'all?

5039
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:43,690
Neighbor.

5040
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:45,490
Oh my god.

5041
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:47,230
Who has such a big mouth?

5042
02:24:47,230 --> 02:24:48,150
I thought those were my friends.

5043
02:24:49,070 --> 02:24:49,510
Welcome.

5044
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:53,930
This is a gigantic house.

5045
02:24:54,690 --> 02:24:55,130
Right?

5046
02:24:55,150 --> 02:24:55,550
What?

5047
02:24:55,630 --> 02:24:57,010
Oh my goodness.

5048
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:58,010
Those people are alive.

5049
02:24:58,870 --> 02:24:59,750
I mean they're dead.

5050
02:24:59,750 --> 02:25:00,050
Nope.

5051
02:25:00,050 --> 02:25:00,510
Not anymore.

5052
02:25:00,510 --> 02:25:00,550
Not anymore.

5053
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:10,400
You good?

5054
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:11,700
Thank you.

5055
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:12,080
Thank you.

5056
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:16,780
They just don't stop coming.

5057
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:18,720
And they don't stop coming.

5058
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:19,800
And they don't stop coming.

5059
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:22,880
And they don't stop coming.

5060
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:23,520
Should we go downstairs?

5061
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:24,660
Sure.

5062
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:28,080
And they don't stop coming.

5063
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:31,220
Oh my god.

5064
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:34,100
Did we get him?

5065
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:36,440
How the heck am I already yellow?

5066
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:38,060
Oh no Hanya.

5067
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:39,040
Oh no.

5068
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:40,440
Use your health pack.

5069
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:43,580
Health pack time.

5070
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:45,600
And they don't stop coming.

5071
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:49,660
I have a molotov in case there's a big gang.

5072
02:25:50,480 --> 02:25:51,120
Oh.

5073
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:51,300
Ow.

5074
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:54,040
Sorry I was shooting the other guy.

5075
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:55,760
I'm stoned.

5076
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:57,760
Ow.

5077
02:25:58,420 --> 02:25:59,060
Jumpy.

5078
02:25:59,060 --> 02:25:59,340
Jumpy.

5079
02:25:59,340 --> 02:25:59,660
Jumpy.

5080
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:00,620
Pecora.

5081
02:26:03,140 --> 02:26:05,820
I hate when Pecora swamps me like that.

5082
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:06,300
That's crazy.

5083
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:07,480
Who?

5084
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:09,280
Dakota.

5085
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:13,500
The hunter is Dakota in her jail outfit.

5086
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:14,860
Wait who's Dakota?

5087
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:16,100
Who's Dakota?

5088
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:18,160
Who's Dakota?

5089
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:19,240
Dakota?

5090
02:26:19,860 --> 02:26:20,540
Who's Dakota?

5091
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:22,780
Who's Dakota?

5092
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:26,840
Oh Pecora.

5093
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:28,020
Oh Pecora.

5094
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:29,280
I also heard Dakota.

5095
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:31,640
Yeah I thought you were saying Dakota.

5096
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,600
I thought you were saying Dakota also.

5097
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:34,460
Dakota.

5098
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:36,160
Haru.

5099
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:36,360
Haru.

5100
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:36,660
Haru.

5101
02:26:36,900 --> 02:26:37,940
She's all the way in the back.

5102
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:38,580
She's about to die.

5103
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:39,360
Oh no.

5104
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:41,800
Smoker.

5105
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:43,220
Oh it was a smoker.

5106
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:44,340
Should I have done the impression?

5107
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:46,320
Yeah do it.

5108
02:26:46,380 --> 02:26:46,500
Do it.

5109
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:46,920
I want to hear it.

5110
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:48,960
Like that?

5111
02:26:49,220 --> 02:26:50,200
Oh that's good.

5112
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:54,520
Do you need a health kit Haru?

5113
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:55,960
Yes I am bleeding.

5114
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:56,880
Okay come here.

5115
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:58,220
Come here and I will heal you.

5116
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,020
I'm about to lose all my spleens.

5117
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:01,920
Spleens?

5118
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:04,640
Oh her spleens.

5119
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:05,780
Where am I?

5120
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:07,060
I can't see anything.

5121
02:27:07,460 --> 02:27:08,760
I guess this is this way.

5122
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,120
Yeah.

5123
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:11,040
What music do I hear?

5124
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:11,760
It's this way.

5125
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:13,120
This way?

5126
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:14,340
Oh hello.

5127
02:27:20,660 --> 02:27:22,480
Some car set off alarms.

5128
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:24,160
Uh oh.

5129
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,260
Guys I'm launching now.

5130
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:32,840
I can't move.

5131
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:33,420
I can't move.

5132
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:34,660
Hey!

5133
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:36,040
What the fuck?

5134
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:38,460
Good girl.

5135
02:27:38,660 --> 02:27:39,320
Good job.

5136
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:39,900
Good girl.

5137
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:43,880
You know what Anya?

5138
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,200
If you're dying and I don't have a med kit.

5139
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:47,900
I'm going to hesitate giving you my med kit this time.

5140
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:49,660
Why do you love your wife?

5141
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:54,580
The girls are fighting.

5142
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:55,740
The girls are fighting.

5143
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:56,260
Oopsie daisy.

5144
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:57,920
Oopsie daisy.

5145
02:27:58,820 --> 02:28:00,300
Okay you're all forgiven.

5146
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:01,640
Guys guys I'm getting drunk.

5147
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:06,020
Oh shit sorry Anya.

5148
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:07,620
Why you gotta brag about it huh?

5149
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:07,840
I'm sorry.

5150
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:07,860
I'm sorry.

5151
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:09,060
Oh my god listen.

5152
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:09,440
Listen.

5153
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:12,960
Is there any...

5154
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,140
Is there any ammo anywhere?

5155
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:17,140
Yeah I also would need some ammo.

5156
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:18,500
I have a pistol.

5157
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:19,420
Nice.

5158
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:22,780
Guess we're going into the subway.

5159
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:23,980
Oh what's this?

5160
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:25,780
Oh a chainsaw if anybody wants it.

5161
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:26,680
Me.

5162
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:27,960
A chainsaw.

5163
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:30,980
A chainsaw.

5164
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:33,140
Where do I buy the bomb?

5165
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:37,580
Let's go down here I think.

5166
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:38,600
Down there?

5167
02:28:38,980 --> 02:28:39,720
Not here?

5168
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:40,220
Oh.

5169
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:40,820
Down here okay.

5170
02:28:41,940 --> 02:28:44,000
There's a site spot just ahead.

5171
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:45,280
Give me a second.

5172
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:47,200
Oh I found some peace.

5173
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:49,640
Safe room with coins.

5174
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:50,680
Wait that was it?

5175
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:53,900
Good job yeah I mean it was the first mission of the...

5176
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:55,240
Oh yeah.

5177
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:56,580
Uh oh.

5178
02:28:57,380 --> 02:28:58,020
Did we?

5179
02:28:58,120 --> 02:28:58,260
Oh.

5180
02:28:58,540 --> 02:28:59,800
I was like, why did we disconnect?

5181
02:29:02,140 --> 02:29:04,420
Alright, mid with the killin'.

5182
02:29:04,420 --> 02:29:05,220
That's my girl.

5183
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:06,960
Hanya with the special killin'.

5184
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:07,540
Woah, five!

5185
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:08,220
Oh my gosh.

5186
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:08,540
Yay!

5187
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:08,980
Yatta!

5188
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:11,660
Killin'.

5189
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:12,960
I'm doin' it.

5190
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:15,360
Rip and tear.

5191
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:16,820
Rip and tear, everybody.

5192
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:18,780
Alright, let me see if there's a better...

5193
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:20,620
I'm gonna heal and then I'm gonna grab.

5194
02:29:20,740 --> 02:29:21,380
What gun is this?

5195
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:21,980
Nope.

5196
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:27,140
Yeah, does everybody have an extra medpack?

5197
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:28,120
I have.

5198
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:30,260
What's a medpack?

5199
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:31,600
Haru, did you grab your medpack?

5200
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:32,980
I don't need one.

5201
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,220
Haru is living on the edge.

5202
02:29:34,260 --> 02:29:35,360
Haru, grab one.

5203
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:36,180
Yeah, Haru!

5204
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:36,860
Yeah!

5205
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:38,220
Come on, Haru!

5206
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:39,080
Yeah!

5207
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:41,480
No, no, no, no!

5208
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:42,580
No!

5209
02:29:42,580 --> 02:29:43,060
No!

5210
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:43,640
No!

5211
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:47,280
How dare you ruin my edginess.

5212
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:48,680
Mata, that's so fucked.

5213
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:50,140
Yeah, it is.

5214
02:29:52,300 --> 02:29:54,420
You don't wanna mess with me with a train saw.

5215
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:56,980
I still hear him.

5216
02:29:57,820 --> 02:30:01,780
Oh, I forgot in my mod I gave him a purple neon shirt as well.

5217
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:02,500
Some of the monsters.

5218
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:03,400
That's so funny.

5219
02:30:04,860 --> 02:30:05,980
No, what do you mean?

5220
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,500
I don't know what he's talking about.

5221
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:09,020
Why you open the door, Hanyar?

5222
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:10,040
Hanyar?

5223
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:11,240
We gonna go kill him.

5224
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:11,540
Hanyar?

5225
02:30:11,580 --> 02:30:11,920
Noir?

5226
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:12,960
Yeah, time to kill.

5227
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:13,360
Hanyar?

5228
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:14,640
Oh my god, we're in the metro!

5229
02:30:15,160 --> 02:30:15,800
Time to kill!

5230
02:30:16,660 --> 02:30:17,400
Wait, where are you guys?

5231
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:18,580
What city is this, canonically?

5232
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:20,340
Are we in, like, the United States?

5233
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:21,500
Probably, right?

5234
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:23,340
Reloading!

5235
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:29,190
Take them!

5236
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:30,370
Get them all!

5237
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:34,150
Rip and tear until everything is dead!

5238
02:30:35,530 --> 02:30:36,630
Rip and tear!

5239
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:37,750
Rip and tear!

5240
02:30:38,050 --> 02:30:39,070
Rip and tear!

5241
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:40,350
Rip and tear!

5242
02:30:40,590 --> 02:30:41,210
Rip and tear!

5243
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:42,130
Why do we need a train saw?

5244
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:43,410
Oh.

5245
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:46,830
This way?

5246
02:30:47,490 --> 02:30:48,110
Kill, kill.

5247
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:49,250
I like trains.

5248
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:50,350
Destroy, destroy, destroy.

5249
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:51,270
I love trains.

5250
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:52,550
Uh-oh.

5251
02:30:52,570 --> 02:30:53,350
Kill, kill, kill!

5252
02:30:53,350 --> 02:30:53,470
Ah!

5253
02:30:55,270 --> 02:30:55,930
That's right!

5254
02:30:57,810 --> 02:30:59,210
I can't tell if it's dead!

5255
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:04,900
Nice!

5256
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:08,060
Oh, Haruka.

5257
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:08,820
Yay!

5258
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:09,300
Nice!

5259
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:09,740
I did it!

5260
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:11,360
Haruka, are you okay?

5261
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:12,080
Let me patch you up.

5262
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:13,040
Oh my gosh, are you...

5263
02:31:13,580 --> 02:31:14,120
Don't, don't help me!

5264
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:14,860
I don't need a med kit!

5265
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:15,300
No!

5266
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:16,200
No!

5267
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:17,700
Take your meds, grandpa!

5268
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:18,500
Take your meds!

5269
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:20,600
Take your meds, Haruka.

5270
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:21,080
Many, many, many time!

5271
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:22,300
They are taking my rage!

5272
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:23,360
Really?

5273
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:25,720
Take your meds, Haruka.

5274
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:27,680
What's this one?

5275
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:30,760
I think I wanna go with this one.

5276
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,060
Take your meds, grandma.

5277
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:34,680
Oh, there's my beautiful goon.

5278
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:35,880
Grandma.

5279
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:37,600
Oh, sorry.

5280
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:39,160
Can we not shoot me?

5281
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:39,780
That would be great.

5282
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:40,540
Sorry.

5283
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:42,740
I don't need my meds.

5284
02:31:42,860 --> 02:31:43,380
Sorry.

5285
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,520
Why are you like this?

5286
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:48,920
I'm like this.

5287
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,420
You don't wanna face with me.

5288
02:31:52,420 --> 02:31:53,240
Oh.

5289
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:54,320
Steve!

5290
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:55,760
Oh, John.

5291
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:56,620
Leave me alone.

5292
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:58,620
Steve, you've been caught this wrong.

5293
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,100
Steve!

5294
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,280
Here they come.

5295
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:03,380
Oh my goodness.

5296
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:04,300
Oh my goodness.

5297
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:05,500
I can't see anything.

5298
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:06,600
Right?

5299
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:09,500
My vision is just blinded by everything.

5300
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:10,700
My beauty?

5301
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:14,580
Blinded by my sexiness.

5302
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:15,540
Just say it, Mint.

5303
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:21,220
I don't need no fucking medicine to be able to kick some fucking zombie's ass into the next Tuesday.

5304
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:22,400
There's some Molotov over there.

5305
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:24,780
Molotov?

5306
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:25,240
Molotov?

5307
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:26,540
It's straight stuff for breakfast.

5308
02:32:26,780 --> 02:32:27,360
Just drink that.

5309
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:27,740
Three words.

5310
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:28,620
Eight letters.

5311
02:32:28,900 --> 02:32:29,660
Hell yeah.

5312
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,400
What's the letter?

5313
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:32,460
Hell yeah.

5314
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:33,600
Do you know how to smell?

5315
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:35,280
I'll tell you what.

5316
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:35,860
Apparently not.

5317
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:39,040
Guys, there's ammo here upstairs and a big gun.

5318
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:39,100
Okay.

5319
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:39,680
Oh yeah, there's ammo.

5320
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:40,240
There's ammo.

5321
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:41,280
And there's stairs.

5322
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,100
I think this is where we need to go in the future.

5323
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:43,560
What's the guy in the back?

5324
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:43,940
Oh, what's this?

5325
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:44,640
Oh, big gun.

5326
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:45,040
Yeah.

5327
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:46,140
Big goon.

5328
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:47,200
Big gun?

5329
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:47,300
Yeah.

5330
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:49,640
The boy ammo packs on the ground to share ammo with the team.

5331
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:51,380
Okay, I'm gonna have an extra ammo for us.

5332
02:32:51,460 --> 02:32:51,720
Yeah.

5333
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:53,460
For like a big fight if we all run out.

5334
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:55,260
We go up these stairs, I believe.

5335
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:55,800
Okay.

5336
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:56,240
Hell yeah, brother.

5337
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:56,480
Here we go.

5338
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:57,220
I'll grab stairs.

5339
02:32:57,340 --> 02:32:58,160
Oh, look at him, girly.

5340
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:00,280
Oh, accidentally took the wrong gun.

5341
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:00,780
Whoopsie.

5342
02:33:01,700 --> 02:33:03,420
We gotta flick them door switch.

5343
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:06,520
However, there's gonna be a horde if we do so.

5344
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:07,180
Be careful.

5345
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:07,980
Okay.

5346
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:08,520
Okay.

5347
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:12,200
Yeah, make sure you grab the little molotov.

5348
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:13,000
Yay!

5349
02:33:13,580 --> 02:33:13,860
Yep.

5350
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:16,440
Am I just gonna be talking like this for the rest of the mission?

5351
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:17,360
Are you?

5352
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,640
Are you gonna be talking like this, Haruko?

5353
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:21,400
Oh my god.

5354
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:21,600
Hey, everyone.

5355
02:33:26,180 --> 02:33:27,280
Oh my god.

5356
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:28,140
There's like a big turret.

5357
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:30,200
Oh, Haruka alerted the horde.

5358
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:32,920
Does anybody want to get crazy with the big turret?

5359
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:33,900
Yeah, you got it, girly.

5360
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,220
Come on.

5361
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,320
Oh, I can't.

5362
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:36,000
It's very limited.

5363
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:36,940
Oh, gosh.

5364
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:38,240
Do your best.

5365
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:38,700
Do your best.

5366
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:39,140
Uh-oh.

5367
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:41,340
Um, yep.

5368
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:44,520
Help me.

5369
02:33:46,780 --> 02:33:49,420
Oh, nice.

5370
02:33:50,380 --> 02:33:51,420
We got a big boy.

5371
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:51,700
Big boy.

5372
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:54,620
Uh, okay.

5373
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:55,280
Sorry.

5374
02:33:58,480 --> 02:33:58,880
Charging.

5375
02:33:58,960 --> 02:33:59,320
Oh my god.

5376
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:00,280
Oh my god.

5377
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:01,380
You will fuck this shit.

5378
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:03,120
Me, behind you.

5379
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:03,940
Behind me?

5380
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:04,920
How do I get off this thing?

5381
02:34:08,690 --> 02:34:09,270
Oh, gosh.

5382
02:34:09,290 --> 02:34:11,370
I'm really struggling with this gun.

5383
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:12,110
Why can't I shoot?

5384
02:34:12,310 --> 02:34:13,470
Why wouldn't it shoot?

5385
02:34:15,010 --> 02:34:16,550
Son of a bitch, I'm down.

5386
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:18,050
You're down?

5387
02:34:18,290 --> 02:34:19,130
Oh, where am I?

5388
02:34:19,190 --> 02:34:20,110
I'm down.

5389
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:26,920
Oh, are you good?

5390
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:27,200
I'm down.

5391
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:29,180
He's alive.

5392
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:29,820
Ready?

5393
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:31,200
Yeah, I'm not loving this shotgun.

5394
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:32,600
I think it's not my type of gun.

5395
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:35,580
It's hard when you have to shoot fast, you know?

5396
02:34:35,720 --> 02:34:36,020
Ready?

5397
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:36,100
Yeah.

5398
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:38,700
I need one of those.

5399
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:38,900
Yeah, that's why I switched to...

5400
02:34:38,900 --> 02:34:41,580
I need one of them fast American guns.

5401
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:42,580
You know what I mean?

5402
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:43,140
I'm gonna shoot you.

5403
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:44,420
Whoa.

5404
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:46,920
None of these Russian Kalashnikovs for me.

5405
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:48,960
For me.

5406
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:50,440
All right, queens.

5407
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:52,840
None of them Soviet buildings for me.

5408
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:53,140
Where do we go?

5409
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:53,920
Oh, shit.

5410
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:54,560
I'm getting dunked.

5411
02:34:54,860 --> 02:34:55,420
Help me.

5412
02:34:56,220 --> 02:34:56,780
Thank you.

5413
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:57,180
Oh, shit.

5414
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:57,540
What?

5415
02:34:57,660 --> 02:34:58,180
You got it?

5416
02:34:58,280 --> 02:34:58,560
Nice.

5417
02:34:58,920 --> 02:34:59,400
Yeah.

5418
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:00,840
Fuck you, young McDonald.

5419
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:01,860
Nice.

5420
02:35:01,860 --> 02:35:01,960
Nice.

5421
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:05,080
I still remember the time you gave me a raw burger, that son of a bitch.

5422
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:05,700
Oh.

5423
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:09,280
That's not very American of him.

5424
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:09,940
I'm good.

5425
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:10,860
I'm good.

5426
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:11,680
Eat a burger.

5427
02:35:12,300 --> 02:35:13,560
I tell you what.

5428
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:15,960
I tell you what, Bobby.

5429
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:20,160
Real good American burger made on the propane gas.

5430
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:21,360
Is there any gas for my chainsaw?

5431
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:23,100
Chainsaw.

5432
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:24,920
I hear crying.

5433
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:25,740
Me too.

5434
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:26,920
I hear crying.

5435
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:27,180
Oh, there's a shovel here.

5436
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:28,380
I hear crying every day of my life.

5437
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:29,920
That's me when I cry on the plane.

5438
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:32,300
That's the weakness leaving my body.

5439
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:35,000
Oh, I hear a...

5440
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:35,980
What the?

5441
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:38,820
Help us.

5442
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:40,560
Help us.

5443
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:41,440
It's a YouTuber.

5444
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:43,960
Why won't they help us?

5445
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:45,380
Guys, why won't you help us?

5446
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:45,560
What?

5447
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:46,660
They just left us.

5448
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:51,660
It's a doggy dog world out there.

5449
02:35:51,660 --> 02:35:53,320
They just wanted to film the doggy dog.

5450
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:56,340
I used to think that it was doggy dog.

5451
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:57,100
Oh, yeah.

5452
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:57,180
Doggy dog.

5453
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:57,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5454
02:35:57,620 --> 02:35:58,180
I know what you mean.

5455
02:35:58,780 --> 02:35:59,660
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5456
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:00,620
Doggy dog world.

5457
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:00,920
Doggy dog world.

5458
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,160
I'll tell you.

5459
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:03,980
I'll tell you what.

5460
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:04,520
Is it down here?

5461
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:05,880
I'll tell you what.

5462
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:06,820
I believe so.

5463
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:08,340
Oh, Haru.

5464
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:09,980
What happened to not needing med kits, huh?

5465
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,180
Sae picked up and used that med kit.

5466
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:16,160
Oh, sorry, Haru.

5467
02:36:16,380 --> 02:36:16,780
Sorry.

5468
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:18,400
Sorry, Haru.

5469
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:23,340
Oh, jeez.

5470
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:24,140
Oh, jeez.

5471
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:24,600
Oh.

5472
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:25,540
Oh, golly.

5473
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:26,520
Why don't they save us?

5474
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:26,940
Oh, golly.

5475
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:27,180
Oh, golly.

5476
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:29,460
I'm able to use med kit to be able to wield my health.

5477
02:36:29,460 --> 02:36:30,120
Guys, guys, guys.

5478
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:30,460
I need your help.

5479
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:32,420
I'm getting jockeyed.

5480
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:34,560
Oh, no.

5481
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:36,100
Stop.

5482
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:39,360
Why can't I get out?

5483
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:40,440
Oh, my gosh.

5484
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:41,040
There we go.

5485
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:42,320
Oh, gosh.

5486
02:36:42,460 --> 02:36:43,080
Oh, gosh.

5487
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:45,780
Fuck you, wing.

5488
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,180
I'm allergic to women.

5489
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:49,780
And off of my body, sick fuck.

5490
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:50,500
I got you.

5491
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:52,240
I got you.

5492
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:55,820
Oh, that's crazy.

5493
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:56,940
I don't need no medicine.

5494
02:36:57,140 --> 02:36:57,980
I can just meditate.

5495
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,040
My health will come back.

5496
02:36:59,040 --> 02:36:59,100
Oh, that's crazy.

5497
02:37:01,580 --> 02:37:04,620
Manifest a healthy lifestyle, and it will come to you.

5498
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:11,160
Honestly, I need nothing but American burgers, then my health will come back.

5499
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:11,380
Well, okay.

5500
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:12,500
Come here, Matara-Khan.

5501
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:12,880
Come here.

5502
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:14,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5503
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:18,240
Oh, I sure do love medicine.

5504
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:19,480
Chow down on that.

5505
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:21,140
Chow down.

5506
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:23,280
I love my prescription medication.

5507
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:24,840
I tell you what.

5508
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:27,120
Oh, sorry.

5509
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:28,280
What have you done?

5510
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:28,880
What have you done?

5511
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:29,080
What have you done?

5512
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:31,440
I thought you were gonna say, go, go, go, go.

5513
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:32,580
This is bad.

5514
02:37:32,580 --> 02:37:33,700
I was just testing it.

5515
02:37:33,820 --> 02:37:34,140
T Index.

5516
02:37:38,550 --> 02:37:39,050
Careful.

5517
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:40,050
I'm gonna put a fire.

5518
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:40,610
Move, move, move.

5519
02:37:40,710 --> 02:37:41,150
Move, move, move.

5520
02:37:41,330 --> 02:37:42,750
Could you warn me?

5521
02:37:44,510 --> 02:37:45,470
Oh, my God.

5522
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:51,490
I'm setting another fire.

5523
02:37:53,530 --> 02:37:55,470
Give me fire.

5524
02:37:55,690 --> 02:37:56,610
Oh, my God.

5525
02:37:56,610 --> 02:37:57,750
Turning up, baby.

5526
02:37:58,590 --> 02:38:00,110
I am the wave of a landslop.

5527
02:38:00,330 --> 02:38:00,830
I am the wave of my landslop.

5528
02:38:00,850 --> 02:38:02,970
I'm seeing what a dog sees.

5529
02:38:03,150 --> 02:38:04,450
No color in my future.

5530
02:38:04,450 --> 02:38:06,070
No color in your future.

5531
02:38:06,170 --> 02:38:07,770
No color in my future.

5532
02:38:08,410 --> 02:38:10,950
No color in your future except red wine blue.

5533
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:11,850
See, we handle that.

5534
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:13,350
We say we handle that.

5535
02:38:14,630 --> 02:38:16,010
Free ice cream.

5536
02:38:16,530 --> 02:38:18,330
Quick, there's a safe room in here.

5537
02:38:18,710 --> 02:38:19,430
Oh, nice.

5538
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:22,690
Are the only colors in my life.

5539
02:38:22,690 --> 02:38:24,090
But what if I don't want to get in?

5540
02:38:24,310 --> 02:38:25,450
What if I like it?

5541
02:38:25,650 --> 02:38:27,490
I'll shoot you down, you son of a bitch.

5542
02:38:27,490 --> 02:38:27,810
Ah!

5543
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:34,890
How unpatriotic of you to come to.

5544
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:37,930
Almost about to die.

5545
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:38,750
Nice!

5546
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:43,270
Absolutely unpatriotic.

5547
02:38:44,290 --> 02:38:45,850
He was about to die.

5548
02:38:45,930 --> 02:38:46,930
Yee-haw!

5549
02:38:46,970 --> 02:38:49,210
That's the patriotic experience.

5550
02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:51,230
Yay!

5551
02:38:51,350 --> 02:38:52,030
Talk medicine.

5552
02:38:52,690 --> 02:38:55,370
I love the Fourth of July.

5553
02:38:56,070 --> 02:38:56,870
Ugh.

5554
02:38:57,770 --> 02:38:59,370
Use your health kit.

5555
02:38:59,550 --> 02:39:00,730
I'm using my health kit.

5556
02:39:01,410 --> 02:39:02,490
You're giving me anxiety.

5557
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:05,210
I'm going to meditate real quick.

5558
02:39:05,210 --> 02:39:05,510
I'm going to meditate real quick.

5559
02:39:06,130 --> 02:39:06,910
Do it.

5560
02:39:07,630 --> 02:39:08,930
I am meditating.

5561
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:12,350
Now my ankle has magically fixed itself.

5562
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:13,230
That's crazy.

5563
02:39:13,690 --> 02:39:14,210
Crazy.

5564
02:39:17,050 --> 02:39:19,650
Is there any gas in my chain muscle?

5565
02:39:20,210 --> 02:39:20,730
Crazy?

5566
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:22,030
I don't think there's any gas here.

5567
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:22,650
Ghosting!

5568
02:39:23,910 --> 02:39:25,370
Don't talk to me about the rats!

5569
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:27,750
Which way do we go?

5570
02:39:28,330 --> 02:39:29,050
I don't know.

5571
02:39:29,070 --> 02:39:29,830
Let's go here, I think.

5572
02:39:29,970 --> 02:39:30,750
Because this one's bigger.

5573
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:31,990
What is this?

5574
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:37,030
I think we can go either way.

5575
02:39:37,850 --> 02:39:38,250
Oh.

5576
02:39:38,650 --> 02:39:39,050
Maybe?

5577
02:39:40,030 --> 02:39:40,430
Maybe.

5578
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:43,310
There's like a few drugs here and stuff.

5579
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:45,810
Yeah, there's some weapons here and stuff.

5580
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:47,290
And some pills.

5581
02:39:48,830 --> 02:39:49,430
What's this one?

5582
02:39:51,370 --> 02:39:51,770
Um.

5583
02:39:51,770 --> 02:39:52,830
Only freaks climb up ladders.

5584
02:39:52,830 --> 02:39:54,730
Oh man, climbing up ladders are bad.

5585
02:39:55,070 --> 02:39:55,690
And snakes.

5586
02:39:56,090 --> 02:39:56,570
Remember that.

5587
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:58,270
Is that a magnum?

5588
02:39:58,610 --> 02:39:59,910
I love my banana.

5589
02:40:00,730 --> 02:40:01,510
Which one?

5590
02:40:03,350 --> 02:40:03,910
Jockey!

5591
02:40:04,310 --> 02:40:04,870
Jockey!

5592
02:40:06,470 --> 02:40:07,030
Yee!

5593
02:40:07,530 --> 02:40:10,430
What was the gun I like?

5594
02:40:10,430 --> 02:40:10,990
Was it this one?

5595
02:40:12,350 --> 02:40:12,910
Haunter!

5596
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:13,710
Oh, what do I hear?

5597
02:40:13,930 --> 02:40:14,490
Ahhhhh!

5598
02:40:16,010 --> 02:40:16,570
Nice.

5599
02:40:18,610 --> 02:40:19,450
Little bastard.

5600
02:40:20,790 --> 02:40:22,610
AK is better on this map.

5601
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:23,230
Yay!

5602
02:40:23,230 --> 02:40:24,210
Wait, pipe bomb.

5603
02:40:24,290 --> 02:40:25,590
What do you mean yay?

5604
02:40:26,530 --> 02:40:27,430
I got a pipe bomb.

5605
02:40:27,510 --> 02:40:28,310
Oh, I got AD!

5606
02:40:30,470 --> 02:40:30,870
What?

5607
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:32,150
AD!

5608
02:40:33,110 --> 02:40:34,150
I thought you said ADD.

5609
02:40:34,230 --> 02:40:36,230
Me too, I thought you said big ADD.

5610
02:40:36,370 --> 02:40:36,930
Not AD!

5611
02:40:36,930 --> 02:40:37,450
Let's go here.

5612
02:40:37,630 --> 02:40:38,270
What do y'all think?

5613
02:40:38,490 --> 02:40:39,350
Yeah, this is the way.

5614
02:40:41,170 --> 02:40:43,910
If you see zombies, you know you're going the right way.

5615
02:40:44,090 --> 02:40:44,470
True.

5616
02:40:44,470 --> 02:40:48,590
If you see zombies, better hit them right between the eyes.

5617
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:48,810
Wow!

5618
02:40:48,810 --> 02:40:51,250
He's zombies in the Five Nights at Freddy's.

5619
02:40:51,310 --> 02:40:52,830
Hit em right between the eyes.

5620
02:40:52,850 --> 02:40:54,630
Hit em right between the eyes.

5621
02:40:56,110 --> 02:40:58,330
Would you like a Krabby Patty?

5622
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:03,610
No, but I'll take some free ice cream.

5623
02:41:04,510 --> 02:41:05,690
Yummy, yummy.

5624
02:41:06,010 --> 02:41:07,290
Free ice cream?

5625
02:41:07,410 --> 02:41:07,930
Oh!

5626
02:41:10,330 --> 02:41:11,210
Free lo...

5627
02:41:11,210 --> 02:41:14,290
Oh my gosh.

5628
02:41:14,410 --> 02:41:15,230
Leave me alone.

5629
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:16,170
Ugly.

5630
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:18,150
Ugly.

5631
02:41:18,590 --> 02:41:19,350
Ugly.

5632
02:41:20,330 --> 02:41:21,610
Oh my gosh.

5633
02:41:23,890 --> 02:41:25,570
Thank you, ladies.

5634
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:28,710
Yee-haw to you.

5635
02:41:29,030 --> 02:41:29,970
Yee-haw to...

5636
02:41:29,970 --> 02:41:31,030
What is this accent?

5637
02:41:32,410 --> 02:41:34,750
I don't think that was...

5638
02:41:34,750 --> 02:41:41,670
I'm Bethany Ann and I lost my left nipple in a hot dog eating contest in Tucson, Arizona.

5639
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:45,970
Yee-haw.

5640
02:41:47,070 --> 02:41:47,890
Thank you!

5641
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:51,470
Um.

5642
02:41:51,490 --> 02:41:52,850
Was that me?

5643
02:41:53,350 --> 02:41:54,030
Um.

5644
02:41:57,010 --> 02:41:57,690
Everyone.

5645
02:41:59,270 --> 02:41:59,950
What?

5646
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:02,430
It wasn't me.

5647
02:42:03,130 --> 02:42:04,390
It wasn't me.

5648
02:42:04,730 --> 02:42:06,570
It wasn't me.

5649
02:42:07,230 --> 02:42:10,610
It wasn't me at all.

5650
02:42:10,730 --> 02:42:11,330
Wasn't me.

5651
02:42:11,330 --> 02:42:12,230
It wasn't me.

5652
02:42:15,090 --> 02:42:16,210
Oh no.

5653
02:42:16,210 --> 02:42:17,090
Oh no!

5654
02:42:17,290 --> 02:42:18,370
Free ice cream!

5655
02:42:18,770 --> 02:42:20,770
Free ice cream!

5656
02:42:21,070 --> 02:42:22,010
Where are they gonna be?

5657
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:23,150
I have a molotov.

5658
02:42:23,650 --> 02:42:24,330
Me too.

5659
02:42:24,570 --> 02:42:25,290
I have a pipe bomb.

5660
02:42:25,830 --> 02:42:27,190
I have a molotov!

5661
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:28,510
Oh no, I have a pipe bomb.

5662
02:42:28,690 --> 02:42:29,210
I have a pipe bomb.

5663
02:42:31,050 --> 02:42:31,990
There's a guy right there.

5664
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:35,190
I'm allergic to teletubbies.

5665
02:42:35,770 --> 02:42:36,670
Oh, sorry baby.

5666
02:42:36,830 --> 02:42:37,470
I shot you.

5667
02:42:37,650 --> 02:42:37,850
Me?

5668
02:42:39,870 --> 02:42:44,330
I just shot you in the genitalia.

5669
02:42:45,930 --> 02:42:49,030
Honestly, I was just intimidated by how big he is.

5670
02:42:49,070 --> 02:42:50,410
I swear to God.

5671
02:42:50,850 --> 02:42:56,630
I thought to myself, if I can get him to have a little smaller genitalia, I'll be less intimidated.

5672
02:42:56,630 --> 02:42:57,950
What are you talking about?

5673
02:42:58,010 --> 02:42:59,550
What are you talking about?

5674
02:43:00,470 --> 02:43:02,550
I don't know how I feel about this.

5675
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:02,930
I'm inside.

5676
02:43:03,970 --> 02:43:04,610
Let's see.

5677
02:43:04,750 --> 02:43:07,130
I wish I was inside the warmth.

5678
02:43:08,570 --> 02:43:10,090
I'm now stuck in here.

5679
02:43:10,130 --> 02:43:10,650
Let's go.

5680
02:43:10,650 --> 02:43:11,150
Let's go.

5681
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:12,590
Let's go.

5682
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:13,690
Guys, we still need you.

5683
02:43:14,330 --> 02:43:17,710
Come right back, you unpatriotic sons of guns.

5684
02:43:18,050 --> 02:43:19,050
What are you talking about?

5685
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:19,490
We're killing.

5686
02:43:19,610 --> 02:43:21,130
That's the most patriotic thing you could do.

5687
02:43:21,450 --> 02:43:24,150
Come back, you unpatriotic girls.

5688
02:43:24,750 --> 02:43:25,670
Oh, sorry.

5689
02:43:25,810 --> 02:43:26,970
Ow, guys.

5690
02:43:27,370 --> 02:43:27,850
Ow.

5691
02:43:28,090 --> 02:43:28,610
Hi, Rupo.

5692
02:43:28,770 --> 02:43:29,010
Thank you.

5693
02:43:29,010 --> 02:43:30,070
Where are you going over there?

5694
02:43:30,450 --> 02:43:31,550
I'm drinking beer.

5695
02:43:31,790 --> 02:43:32,650
Am I dying?

5696
02:43:33,390 --> 02:43:34,070
Don't die.

5697
02:43:34,410 --> 02:43:35,250
Don't die.

5698
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:37,970
Don't die.

5699
02:43:37,970 --> 02:43:38,430
Don't die.

5700
02:43:38,990 --> 02:43:39,150
Don't die.

5701
02:43:39,150 --> 02:43:39,290
Don't die.

5702
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:48,940
Don't die.

5703
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:51,600
Oh, there's a tongue man.

5704
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:53,080
Tongue, tongue, tongue.

5705
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:53,800
Tongue, tongue.

5706
02:43:58,900 --> 02:43:59,720
Guys, guys, guys.

5707
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:00,040
I need help.

5708
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:01,220
I got you.

5709
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:02,080
Sorry.

5710
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:03,800
He hit me right as I was providing you.

5711
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:05,160
Yeah, I know.

5712
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:07,040
Penny, I need your help.

5713
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:08,160
Okay.

5714
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:08,420
I'm coming.

5715
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:09,160
Oh, wow.

5716
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:10,340
Oh, gosh.

5717
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:10,800
Hello?

5718
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,520
Leave me alone.

5719
02:44:11,720 --> 02:44:12,300
Hey, what am I?

5720
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:13,760
Oh, my God.

5721
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:14,540
Leave me alone.

5722
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:15,480
You're so sad.

5723
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:16,200
They're obsessed with me.

5724
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:17,660
I know.

5725
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:18,920
Oh, that's a gun.

5726
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,580
Down here, you bitches.

5727
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:22,740
I'm seeing like a dog.

5728
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:23,360
I'm seeing like a dog.

5729
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:24,220
I'm coming.

5730
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:25,920
It's Three Dog.

5731
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:26,480
Ow.

5732
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:27,740
What?

5733
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:28,420
This way.

5734
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:28,760
Okay, guys.

5735
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:30,980
There's another health kit here if anybody needs.

5736
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:32,640
Oh, I need if I can have it.

5737
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:32,940
Get it, Mint.

5738
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:33,740
Yeah, yeah.

5739
02:44:33,740 --> 02:44:33,960
Have it.

5740
02:44:33,980 --> 02:44:34,100
Have it.

5741
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:34,220
Here.

5742
02:44:35,580 --> 02:44:36,500
I'm going to do the other one.

5743
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:37,500
Weak.

5744
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:39,520
Weak as hell.

5745
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:40,280
Me?

5746
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:41,140
Weak as hell.

5747
02:44:42,280 --> 02:44:44,660
Who needs medicine this day and age?

5748
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:45,240
Not me.

5749
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:46,160
I just meditate.

5750
02:44:46,580 --> 02:44:46,720
You know what?

5751
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:51,980
I don't think about the consequences I'm already in, so I don't even think about getting hit.

5752
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:55,320
I saw you sneaking medicine, Haruka, earlier.

5753
02:44:55,340 --> 02:44:58,860
Yeah, you were sneaking medicine in the middle of the night.

5754
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:00,780
I saw you take them drugs.

5755
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:02,100
It wasn't medicine.

5756
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:03,240
It was a prescribed medication.

5757
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:05,060
That wasn't very American of you.

5758
02:45:05,380 --> 02:45:06,340
You brought a medicine.

5759
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:07,800
Guys, I have a pile.

5760
02:45:08,420 --> 02:45:09,640
Next time the zombies...

5761
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:10,040
Oh, shit.

5762
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:12,240
Oh, ow.

5763
02:45:12,540 --> 02:45:13,620
I got a donkey.

5764
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:14,480
Oh, thank you.

5765
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:17,480
Next time the zombie horde comes...

5766
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:18,300
Yeah?

5767
02:45:18,380 --> 02:45:18,920
Oh, fuck.

5768
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:19,440
I need your help.

5769
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:19,820
I need your help.

5770
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:20,200
I need your help.

5771
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:20,380
I...

5772
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:21,800
Oh, sorry.

5773
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:21,960
Oh, shit.

5774
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:23,240
It's okay.

5775
02:45:23,620 --> 02:45:23,980
It's okay.

5776
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:24,160
You just...

5777
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:26,020
I'm gonna vile bomb them.

5778
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:26,880
Lucky.

5779
02:45:26,980 --> 02:45:27,920
It's a really good...

5780
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:29,780
Weapons over here.

5781
02:45:30,060 --> 02:45:31,040
I'm gonna vile bomb them.

5782
02:45:31,140 --> 02:45:32,140
Weapons over here.

5783
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:33,280
Right now?

5784
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:34,240
I did a little close.

5785
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:36,140
I think I did a little too close, but it's okay.

5786
02:45:36,340 --> 02:45:36,500
Yeah, you did.

5787
02:45:36,540 --> 02:45:37,020
It's fine.

5788
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:37,560
Probably.

5789
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:38,400
Whoopsie daisy.

5790
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:39,780
Whoopsie whoopsie.

5791
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:40,880
Your honor, I plead whoopsie whoopsie.

5792
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:41,880
I cannot even see where I am.

5793
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:43,700
Oh, from up the stairs?

5794
02:45:43,900 --> 02:45:43,920
Where do we go?

5795
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:44,800
The stairs?

5796
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:45,100
The stairs?

5797
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:45,160
The stairs?

5798
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:45,500
The stairs?

5799
02:45:45,500 --> 02:45:45,600
I got you.

5800
02:45:45,780 --> 02:45:46,380
Oh, okay.

5801
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:49,280
No, we go down here.

5802
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:50,160
This way?

5803
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:50,600
I think.

5804
02:45:50,620 --> 02:45:51,940
Where do we go now?

5805
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:52,620
This way?

5806
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:53,800
Where do we go?

5807
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:55,640
Where do we go now?

5808
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:56,300
Where do we go down here?

5809
02:45:57,260 --> 02:45:59,020
Haruka, I think you had the wrong...

5810
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:01,680
Oh, it's right here.

5811
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:04,580
Oh, please.

5812
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:08,880
Yeah, I'm ready to get stinky smelly.

5813
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:11,920
Yeah, I'm ready to get stinky smelly.

5814
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:12,580
Oh, wait.

5815
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:13,160
I'm actually stuck.

5816
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:14,260
It's so un-stinky.

5817
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:16,000
Wait, how do I get out?

5818
02:46:16,140 --> 02:46:16,640
Oh, there we go.

5819
02:46:16,880 --> 02:46:17,300
Where are you?

5820
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:18,700
Wangy wangy.

5821
02:46:19,020 --> 02:46:19,420
Nice.

5822
02:46:19,420 --> 02:46:19,760
Nice.

5823
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:20,140
Nice.

5824
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:21,500
Oh, there's a witch.

5825
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:22,000
There's a witch.

5826
02:46:22,840 --> 02:46:23,200
Where?

5827
02:46:23,400 --> 02:46:24,520
I hear her crying.

5828
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:25,900
Let's...

5829
02:46:25,900 --> 02:46:27,980
If we aggro her, let's be careful.

5830
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:29,540
I think I heard her.

5831
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:30,340
You just had a big fire.

5832
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:32,700
Well, we can just aggro her.

5833
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:33,520
Oh, Charger, where?

5834
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:34,740
I had you.

5835
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:35,820
Okay, I think we found the Charger.

5836
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:38,100
Oh my gosh.

5837
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:39,440
Thank you.

5838
02:46:39,440 --> 02:46:39,480
Thank you.

5839
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:39,800
I think we found the Charger.

5840
02:46:39,820 --> 02:46:40,320
Thank you.

5841
02:46:41,700 --> 02:46:45,500
I don't think we should aggro the witch because then they bring a horde and we'll die.

5842
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:46,660
Oh, I see.

5843
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:48,400
Why don't we just man up?

5844
02:46:48,760 --> 02:46:49,760
Wait, where did they come from?

5845
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:50,140
And kill the witch.

5846
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:51,860
Where did they go?

5847
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:53,460
They've been married a long time ago.

5848
02:46:53,460 --> 02:46:53,920
Oh, they come inside.

5849
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,400
Guys, guys, there's a little secret way here.

5850
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:57,240
Oh, there's a witch.

5851
02:46:57,340 --> 02:46:58,160
Oh, there's a witch.

5852
02:46:58,220 --> 02:46:58,480
There's a witch.

5853
02:46:59,220 --> 02:46:59,800
Let's kill her.

5854
02:46:59,820 --> 02:46:59,960
Oh, there she is.

5855
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:00,380
There she is.

5856
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:01,320
No, don't kill her.

5857
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:02,240
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

5858
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:02,520
Let's go.

5859
02:47:03,940 --> 02:47:04,680
Just avoid it.

5860
02:47:04,700 --> 02:47:06,120
I think this is going to bite us in the ass.

5861
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:08,000
Yeah, let's go over here.

5862
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:10,680
That guy is dead.

5863
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:12,940
I think this is going to backfire, but you know what?

5864
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:13,560
No.

5865
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:14,560
I don't like the rules.

5866
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:15,260
We're not going back.

5867
02:47:15,340 --> 02:47:15,960
It'll be fine.

5868
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:16,540
It'll be fine.

5869
02:47:16,820 --> 02:47:18,260
I'm just a little follower.

5870
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:20,820
I think we just want to kill the witch and then...

5871
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:21,680
Guys, guys, here, here, here.

5872
02:47:21,800 --> 02:47:22,140
Ammo, ammo.

5873
02:47:22,140 --> 02:47:22,800
I want to kill everything.

5874
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:24,500
I'm ready to kill.

5875
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:26,200
I'm going to kill Bill.

5876
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:28,580
Wait, I'm Bill.

5877
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:29,560
Oh, there's a secret passage over here.

5878
02:47:29,660 --> 02:47:29,940
Oh, what's this?

5879
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:30,700
Yeah.

5880
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:31,760
Wait a minute.

5881
02:47:32,520 --> 02:47:32,920
Oh.

5882
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:34,320
Guys!

5883
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:36,140
Oh, okay.

5884
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:36,800
Nice.

5885
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:37,680
Molotov.

5886
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:38,800
Molotov.

5887
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:38,960
Thank you.

5888
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:39,540
Molotov.

5889
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:40,740
Wait, is there another witch?

5890
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:45,280
No, I think there's only one.

5891
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:46,200
For me, the witch is the ring.

5892
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:48,240
Like that girl from the movie.

5893
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:49,080
Oh, really?

5894
02:47:49,240 --> 02:47:49,780
That's so freaky.

5895
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:50,180
Yeah.

5896
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:51,940
Oh, I see her.

5897
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:52,340
I see her.

5898
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:52,880
She's up there.

5899
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:53,360
She's up there.

5900
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5901
02:47:54,280 --> 02:47:55,000
We went around her.

5902
02:47:55,060 --> 02:47:55,640
Smart girls.

5903
02:47:57,160 --> 02:47:57,920
I think it's here.

5904
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:01,240
Okay.

5905
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:02,800
Stop crying, you baby.

5906
02:48:03,580 --> 02:48:03,900
Oh.

5907
02:48:04,660 --> 02:48:04,980
Wait.

5908
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:06,020
No, I think we went around.

5909
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:07,180
I think you went in a circle.

5910
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:07,580
Yeah.

5911
02:48:07,720 --> 02:48:08,040
Yeah.

5912
02:48:08,040 --> 02:48:08,120
Yeah.

5913
02:48:09,560 --> 02:48:10,200
You're not...

5914
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:10,640
You're not this way.

5915
02:48:10,700 --> 02:48:11,260
You're not excused.

5916
02:48:14,060 --> 02:48:15,280
I don't think it's this way either.

5917
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:18,040
I don't know where to go, actually.

5918
02:48:18,100 --> 02:48:18,240
Oh.

5919
02:48:20,700 --> 02:48:21,020
Oh.

5920
02:48:26,790 --> 02:48:27,750
Oh, nice.

5921
02:48:29,890 --> 02:48:30,210
Nice.

5922
02:48:30,910 --> 02:48:31,230
Nice.

5923
02:48:36,890 --> 02:48:37,530
What about...

5924
02:48:37,530 --> 02:48:38,250
So, the witch is there.

5925
02:48:38,310 --> 02:48:39,270
I think we have to go to the left.

5926
02:48:40,610 --> 02:48:40,930
Yeah.

5927
02:48:40,990 --> 02:48:41,470
We're higher wind.

5928
02:48:41,810 --> 02:48:42,390
We're higher wind?

5929
02:48:42,450 --> 02:48:42,770
Okay.

5930
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:43,270
Yeah.

5931
02:48:43,390 --> 02:48:44,150
We're higher wind, I think.

5932
02:48:44,430 --> 02:48:44,750
Okay.

5933
02:48:45,110 --> 02:48:45,430
Okay.

5934
02:48:46,690 --> 02:48:47,010
Ew.

5935
02:48:47,190 --> 02:48:47,850
Wait for the bile.

5936
02:48:47,930 --> 02:48:48,430
Wait for the bile.

5937
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:53,230
I'm gonna die.

5938
02:48:53,450 --> 02:48:53,590
Oh.

5939
02:48:53,610 --> 02:48:54,910
There was a guy crawling through it.

5940
02:48:54,930 --> 02:48:55,430
That's so freaky.

5941
02:48:55,710 --> 02:48:56,030
Oh.

5942
02:48:56,610 --> 02:48:56,930
Oh.

5943
02:48:57,510 --> 02:48:57,830
Ew.

5944
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:58,550
It's wet in here.

5945
02:49:00,190 --> 02:49:01,290
It's because it's a sewer.

5946
02:49:03,850 --> 02:49:04,630
It's so wet.

5947
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:05,170
It's like...

5948
02:49:05,590 --> 02:49:05,910
Oh.

5949
02:49:05,910 --> 02:49:06,130
Oh.

5950
02:49:06,130 --> 02:49:06,370
Oh.

5951
02:49:06,450 --> 02:49:06,590
Oh.

5952
02:49:07,910 --> 02:49:08,230
Wait.

5953
02:49:08,410 --> 02:49:08,750
I can't...

5954
02:49:08,750 --> 02:49:08,950
Oh.

5955
02:49:09,030 --> 02:49:09,770
I can't see anything.

5956
02:49:09,890 --> 02:49:10,290
What happened?

5957
02:49:12,130 --> 02:49:12,450
Okay.

5958
02:49:12,530 --> 02:49:13,090
The witch is over there.

5959
02:49:13,150 --> 02:49:13,470
Be careful.

5960
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:13,770
Be careful.

5961
02:49:13,870 --> 02:49:13,990
Yeah.

5962
02:49:14,030 --> 02:49:14,490
Come to the...

5963
02:49:14,490 --> 02:49:15,090
Where Hena is.

5964
02:49:15,290 --> 02:49:15,790
This way.

5965
02:49:15,810 --> 02:49:16,030
This way.

5966
02:49:16,150 --> 02:49:16,390
Okay.

5967
02:49:18,050 --> 02:49:20,550
Hena, let me go ahead of you so that I don't accidentally shoot you.

5968
02:49:20,790 --> 02:49:21,110
Oh.

5969
02:49:21,130 --> 02:49:22,710
You guys are headed towards her, though.

5970
02:49:23,250 --> 02:49:23,810
Are you sure?

5971
02:49:24,070 --> 02:49:24,390
Yeah.

5972
02:49:25,170 --> 02:49:25,490
Wait.

5973
02:49:26,950 --> 02:49:27,070
Whoa.

5974
02:49:27,070 --> 02:49:27,230
Hena.

5975
02:49:27,330 --> 02:49:27,450
Hena.

5976
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:27,830
Come back.

5977
02:49:28,810 --> 02:49:29,270
Oh.

5978
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:30,850
Uh-oh.

5979
02:49:31,890 --> 02:49:32,470
You guys?

5980
02:49:32,650 --> 02:49:33,690
I'm no scared of bitches.

5981
02:49:37,210 --> 02:49:37,890
Hell yeah.

5982
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:39,430
Hell yeah.

5983
02:49:41,090 --> 02:49:42,090
I got him.

5984
02:49:42,090 --> 02:49:42,670
Hell yeah.

5985
02:49:43,950 --> 02:49:44,410
Reloading.

5986
02:49:44,850 --> 02:49:45,310
Reloading.

5987
02:49:45,310 --> 02:49:46,170
So not this way.

5988
02:49:48,610 --> 02:49:50,850
Do you need ammo, Haruka?

5989
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:52,690
Oh.

5990
02:49:53,270 --> 02:49:53,890
Hold on.

5991
02:49:53,970 --> 02:49:54,750
Let's come back here.

5992
02:49:54,850 --> 02:49:55,130
Wait.

5993
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:55,850
I don't have the ammo.

5994
02:49:55,870 --> 02:49:56,330
Okay.

5995
02:49:56,550 --> 02:49:56,870
No.

5996
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:56,930
No.

5997
02:49:56,950 --> 02:49:58,130
Haruka, throw the witch.

5998
02:49:58,230 --> 02:49:59,310
Haruka, throw the witch.

5999
02:50:02,910 --> 02:50:04,610
I'm scared no bitches.

6000
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:10,230
You're going to be okay.

6001
02:50:10,230 --> 02:50:10,570
Oh my gosh.

6002
02:50:10,690 --> 02:50:11,250
All right.

6003
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:13,710
Well, now that the witch is dead, it's up here.

6004
02:50:13,730 --> 02:50:14,210
It's up here.

6005
02:50:14,290 --> 02:50:14,670
It's up here.

6006
02:50:14,790 --> 02:50:15,990
Oh my god.

6007
02:50:16,030 --> 02:50:17,550
It was here the whole time.

6008
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:18,930
This one?

6009
02:50:19,250 --> 02:50:19,950
What a thrill.

6010
02:50:19,950 --> 02:50:20,250
Is that a guy?

6011
02:50:20,430 --> 02:50:20,690
No.

6012
02:50:20,690 --> 02:50:21,450
That's not a good guy.

6013
02:50:21,970 --> 02:50:22,410
No.

6014
02:50:22,550 --> 02:50:23,990
There's no good guys in this game.

6015
02:50:26,130 --> 02:50:29,210
I could really use this place to meditate.

6016
02:50:30,270 --> 02:50:30,550
Wait.

6017
02:50:30,550 --> 02:50:31,710
You have to look up.

6018
02:50:31,790 --> 02:50:31,930
Oh my god.

6019
02:50:31,990 --> 02:50:32,910
Bunch of guns over here.

6020
02:50:33,130 --> 02:50:33,490
Yeah.

6021
02:50:33,490 --> 02:50:33,950
You just got to...

6022
02:50:33,950 --> 02:50:35,130
Bunch of guns over here.

6023
02:50:35,230 --> 02:50:36,510
Bunch of guns over here.

6024
02:50:36,550 --> 02:50:37,370
Safe house over there.

6025
02:50:38,470 --> 02:50:39,190
Safe house.

6026
02:50:39,350 --> 02:50:39,750
Oh.

6027
02:50:39,790 --> 02:50:40,390
Safe house over here?

6028
02:50:40,790 --> 02:50:42,250
Are you sure that's a safe house?

6029
02:50:42,410 --> 02:50:44,430
Well, it says house with a plus sign.

6030
02:50:44,470 --> 02:50:44,830
Do you see?

6031
02:50:44,970 --> 02:50:45,290
Yeah.

6032
02:50:45,290 --> 02:50:45,470
Yeah.

6033
02:50:45,510 --> 02:50:45,690
Yeah.

6034
02:50:45,790 --> 02:50:46,470
It's right there.

6035
02:50:46,550 --> 02:50:46,730
It's right there.

6036
02:50:46,730 --> 02:50:47,550
You jerk.

6037
02:50:47,690 --> 02:50:48,410
I didn't know.

6038
02:50:48,910 --> 02:50:49,310
Yatta.

6039
02:50:49,650 --> 02:50:50,050
Yatta.

6040
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:52,190
Are you sure there's a safe house over there?

6041
02:50:52,230 --> 02:50:53,530
There's a med kit right here.

6042
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:53,930
Wait.

6043
02:50:54,090 --> 02:50:54,490
Oh.

6044
02:50:54,490 --> 02:50:55,970
I would love to have it.

6045
02:50:57,050 --> 02:50:57,450
Yeah.

6046
02:50:57,850 --> 02:50:58,730
I'll get you inside.

6047
02:51:00,550 --> 02:51:00,750
Okay.

6048
02:51:00,750 --> 02:51:00,910
Thank you.

6049
02:51:02,190 --> 02:51:03,110
Let's close the door.

6050
02:51:04,350 --> 02:51:04,750
Okay.

6051
02:51:06,290 --> 02:51:07,510
I'm gonna watch TV.

6052
02:51:08,110 --> 02:51:09,270
Oh my god.

6053
02:51:09,350 --> 02:51:09,590
Man.

6054
02:51:09,710 --> 02:51:11,070
You're kind of killing it.

6055
02:51:11,170 --> 02:51:12,370
You're kind of cracked with it.

6056
02:51:12,430 --> 02:51:12,830
Nice.

6057
02:51:13,190 --> 02:51:14,210
I like to kill.

6058
02:51:14,630 --> 02:51:15,670
I like to kill.

6059
02:51:15,990 --> 02:51:16,910
I like to kill.

6060
02:51:17,430 --> 02:51:18,490
I like to kill.

6061
02:51:19,890 --> 02:51:21,110
I like to kill.

6062
02:51:22,150 --> 02:51:23,210
I like to kill.

6063
02:51:23,390 --> 02:51:24,310
I like to kill.

6064
02:51:24,350 --> 02:51:24,890
What did you say, man?

6065
02:51:25,950 --> 02:51:26,530
Come here.

6066
02:51:26,690 --> 02:51:27,270
Oh wait.

6067
02:51:27,330 --> 02:51:27,690
Are you...

6068
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:27,990
Oh here we go.

6069
02:51:29,150 --> 02:51:30,230
Oh thank you.

6070
02:51:30,230 --> 02:51:30,530
Girl, don't go.

6071
02:51:30,530 --> 02:51:32,170
Girls, girls, girls, there's three medkits over here.

6072
02:51:32,810 --> 02:51:35,110
We are not leaving here without you bitches healing.

6073
02:51:36,550 --> 02:51:37,850
I'm watching television.

6074
02:51:39,450 --> 02:51:41,390
Haruka, you piece of shit.

6075
02:51:42,230 --> 02:51:43,510
It's my favorite channel.

6076
02:51:43,990 --> 02:51:45,090
Is that a shotgun?

6077
02:51:45,910 --> 02:51:47,530
I think that's a shotgun.

6078
02:51:48,430 --> 02:51:50,390
I think that would be a good one, right?

6079
02:51:50,510 --> 02:51:51,150
Sorry, grandpa.

6080
02:51:52,330 --> 02:51:54,850
Grandpa grew up as an iPad kid, clearly.

6081
02:51:55,930 --> 02:51:56,590
Guys, there's...

6082
02:51:56,590 --> 02:51:57,290
Okay, I'm gonna take it.

6083
02:51:59,150 --> 02:52:00,170
Oh, we're in the hospital.

6084
02:52:00,210 --> 02:52:01,070
This is so scary.

6085
02:52:02,030 --> 02:52:03,370
I am terrified.

6086
02:52:04,270 --> 02:52:05,090
We're in the hospital.

6087
02:52:05,450 --> 02:52:06,070
We're in the hospital.

6088
02:52:07,750 --> 02:52:08,510
Hospital time.

6089
02:52:10,070 --> 02:52:12,250
Oh, you guys already went?

6090
02:52:12,270 --> 02:52:13,050
I am happy.

6091
02:52:14,450 --> 02:52:15,030
Medication time.

6092
02:52:16,490 --> 02:52:17,690
In a bag.

6093
02:52:18,670 --> 02:52:19,330
Oh, that's a...

6094
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:20,570
Freak me out.

6095
02:52:20,670 --> 02:52:21,570
Oh, does this heal you?

6096
02:52:21,870 --> 02:52:22,430
Freak me out.

6097
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:24,330
Freak me out.

6098
02:52:27,730 --> 02:52:29,690
It was like an oxygen tank.

6099
02:52:30,150 --> 02:52:32,090
Before you go go.

6100
02:52:32,390 --> 02:52:34,010
Why are skeletons so funny?

6101
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:35,790
Why are skeletons so funny?

6102
02:52:35,790 --> 02:52:37,030
Spooky scary skeletons.

6103
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:38,510
Spooky scary skeletons.

6104
02:52:38,590 --> 02:52:39,190
Spooky scary skeletons.

6105
02:52:39,810 --> 02:52:40,910
Spooky scary skeletons.

6106
02:52:41,430 --> 02:52:44,030
Among Us!

6107
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:47,150
Oh, I see him.

6108
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:48,770
Among Us, Among Us.

6109
02:52:50,190 --> 02:52:51,470
Oh, jumper, jumper.

6110
02:52:51,670 --> 02:52:52,310
Jockey, jockey.

6111
02:52:52,490 --> 02:52:53,490
I'm jockey.

6112
02:52:54,090 --> 02:52:55,170
I got him.

6113
02:52:57,610 --> 02:52:58,670
Doughy, Tashi, Marsh.

6114
02:53:03,370 --> 02:53:04,330
Oh, wait.

6115
02:53:04,850 --> 02:53:05,810
Are we got killed?

6116
02:53:06,650 --> 02:53:07,970
Oh, watch out, watch out.

6117
02:53:08,170 --> 02:53:09,490
Sorry, I was scratching my nose.

6118
02:53:11,430 --> 02:53:13,370
Oh my god, now you made my nose itchy.

6119
02:53:14,490 --> 02:53:15,190
Scratch, scratch.

6120
02:53:16,010 --> 02:53:16,730
Scratch, scratch.

6121
02:53:16,990 --> 02:53:20,510
How do you say itch, itch or scratch, scratch in Japanese?

6122
02:53:20,950 --> 02:53:21,630
They're like...

6123
02:53:22,830 --> 02:53:24,210
Itchy you'll be coyote.

6124
02:53:24,890 --> 02:53:25,370
Coyote.

6125
02:53:26,030 --> 02:53:26,510
Coyote.

6126
02:53:27,290 --> 02:53:28,110
Coyote, coyote.

6127
02:53:28,150 --> 02:53:29,950
Coyote is itchy.

6128
02:53:31,010 --> 02:53:31,890
Coyote, coyote.

6129
02:53:32,950 --> 02:53:33,710
Oh, wait.

6130
02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:34,930
How do I get to you guys?

6131
02:53:34,950 --> 02:53:35,190
I'm lost.

6132
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:36,930
So much damage.

6133
02:53:37,650 --> 02:53:38,870
Oh, this way.

6134
02:53:39,090 --> 02:53:39,790
Thank you.

6135
02:53:41,530 --> 02:53:42,470
Coyote, coyote.

6136
02:53:43,010 --> 02:53:44,010
Coyote, coyote.

6137
02:53:44,870 --> 02:53:45,750
Coyote, coyote.

6138
02:53:46,570 --> 02:53:47,770
Second floor time.

6139
02:53:48,230 --> 02:53:49,250
Weapons over here.

6140
02:53:49,810 --> 02:53:51,110
Weapons over here.

6141
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:53,110
Oh, there's a pipe bomb.

6142
02:53:53,110 --> 02:53:53,650
Blah, blah, blah.

6143
02:53:53,970 --> 02:53:55,410
Blah, blah, blah.

6144
02:53:56,850 --> 02:53:59,010
What does this oxygen do?

6145
02:53:59,090 --> 02:53:59,850
Does it just explode?

6146
02:54:00,190 --> 02:54:02,130
Yeah, I think it explodes.

6147
02:54:02,130 --> 02:54:03,310
I think that's the answer.

6148
02:54:04,150 --> 02:54:05,470
I'm hearing a jockey.

6149
02:54:05,470 --> 02:54:06,730
It's Toad.

6150
02:54:06,730 --> 02:54:08,850
I got him.

6151
02:54:09,230 --> 02:54:09,850
Jockey.

6152
02:54:10,470 --> 02:54:11,090
Jockey.

6153
02:54:19,590 --> 02:54:20,210
Oh.

6154
02:54:20,590 --> 02:54:22,350
I thought that was a sparkler.

6155
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:25,490
Reloading.

6156
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:31,850
Bustin' makes her feel good.

6157
02:54:32,170 --> 02:54:33,710
Bustin', bustin', bustin'.

6158
02:54:33,710 --> 02:54:34,430
Oh.

6159
02:54:34,950 --> 02:54:37,170
I got you, princess.

6160
02:54:37,390 --> 02:54:37,950
Thank you.

6161
02:54:38,410 --> 02:54:40,410
Bustin' made me feel good.

6162
02:54:40,570 --> 02:54:43,610
Bustin', bustin', bustin'.

6163
02:54:43,610 --> 02:54:44,730
Oh.

6164
02:54:45,190 --> 02:54:47,710
I didn't know she was there.

6165
02:54:48,030 --> 02:54:48,530
Oh.

6166
02:54:49,210 --> 02:54:49,950
Don't worry.

6167
02:54:50,010 --> 02:54:50,990
I think that's the point, girl.

6168
02:54:55,430 --> 02:54:58,290
So you're probably wondering how I got here.

6169
02:54:58,970 --> 02:54:59,930
Funny story.

6170
02:55:00,330 --> 02:55:01,370
This is kind of funny.

6171
02:55:01,910 --> 02:55:02,850
Oh, thanks.

6172
02:55:03,290 --> 02:55:03,930
You're welcome.

6173
02:55:04,450 --> 02:55:09,630
It was like... I actually saved you guys because I took care of her, you know?

6174
02:55:09,750 --> 02:55:10,170
Blah, blah, blah.

6175
02:55:11,630 --> 02:55:12,570
Is it gonna... Oh!

6176
02:55:16,410 --> 02:55:17,370
You son of a gun.

6177
02:55:17,370 --> 02:55:19,050
I didn't know you were that close.

6178
02:55:19,810 --> 02:55:21,250
This is the infectious air...

6179
02:55:21,250 --> 02:55:22,310
Oh, this is so creepy.

6180
02:55:23,310 --> 02:55:24,170
It is.

6181
02:55:24,270 --> 02:55:25,110
So creepy.

6182
02:55:28,290 --> 02:55:29,430
I don't know if we call this elevator.

6183
02:55:29,710 --> 02:55:30,370
A whore?

6184
02:55:30,770 --> 02:55:32,650
Oh, there it is.

6185
02:55:32,670 --> 02:55:33,750
Did I push it?

6186
02:55:38,890 --> 02:55:39,850
I'm almost...

6187
02:55:39,850 --> 02:55:40,890
Oh my god!

6188
02:55:41,030 --> 02:55:42,470
Back up, back up, back up.

6189
02:55:42,470 --> 02:55:43,510
I'm all good.

6190
02:55:45,030 --> 02:55:48,430
I try to drive on through the night.

6191
02:55:50,470 --> 02:55:51,230
Are we good?

6192
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:52,310
Almost.

6193
02:55:53,430 --> 02:55:54,090
Oh, whoa.

6194
02:55:55,190 --> 02:55:57,010
I believe that hurt me through the door.

6195
02:55:57,110 --> 02:55:57,750
Ugh, annoying.

6196
02:56:00,330 --> 02:56:00,830
Oh my god.

6197
02:56:01,210 --> 02:56:01,970
I got him.

6198
02:56:02,450 --> 02:56:04,650
So one more hit and I am dead.

6199
02:56:04,950 --> 02:56:05,330
Okay.

6200
02:56:11,440 --> 02:56:12,180
Where's the elevator?

6201
02:56:13,320 --> 02:56:14,420
Why is it so slow?

6202
02:56:14,500 --> 02:56:15,800
It shouldn't be this slow at a hospital.

6203
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:16,880
That's dangerous.

6204
02:56:17,720 --> 02:56:18,820
Among Us, Among Us coming.

6205
02:56:19,720 --> 02:56:20,460
Among Us.

6206
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:23,420
Oh my god.

6207
02:56:24,260 --> 02:56:25,500
There's so many Among Us.

6208
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,460
Oh fuck, big guy, big guy, big guy.

6209
02:56:29,100 --> 02:56:30,040
Guys, I am dead.

6210
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:30,680
Oh, you guys are dead.

6211
02:56:30,980 --> 02:56:31,660
Oh no.

6212
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:33,280
You got him?

6213
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:34,620
I got you.

6214
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:39,520
Thank you.

6215
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:45,720
Oh, watch out for the...

6216
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:54,980
Oh, there we go.

6217
02:56:55,100 --> 02:56:55,880
Where's my lucky number?

6218
02:56:57,540 --> 02:56:58,980
Where's my favorite number?

6219
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:01,100
Three is my favorite number.

6220
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,760
Four is my favorite number.

6221
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:03,820
Really?

6222
02:57:03,820 --> 02:57:05,040
Miss, pick your own favorite number.

6223
02:57:05,340 --> 02:57:06,800
Oh wait, is that your favorite number?

6224
02:57:06,820 --> 02:57:08,120
I got this number first.

6225
02:57:08,300 --> 02:57:09,020
It's dead.

6226
02:57:09,320 --> 02:57:11,120
Why is everybody picking four?

6227
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:14,220
I liked number four before you were dead.

6228
02:57:14,420 --> 02:57:16,780
I liked four forever.

6229
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:20,400
I am old.

6230
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:22,720
Four plus infinity.

6231
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:25,180
It's the day that I was born.

6232
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:26,100
My flesh woman.

6233
02:57:26,100 --> 02:57:27,140
It's in your mouth.

6234
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:28,500
Hence, it's mine.

6235
02:57:30,260 --> 02:57:31,860
Okay, how about we both like the number four?

6236
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:35,060
How about that?

6237
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:35,940
How about we both can like number four?

6238
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:38,920
If we like 44, we can split the four, you know?

6239
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:39,860
No, I like two.

6240
02:57:39,940 --> 02:57:40,580
I like 24.

6241
02:57:40,900 --> 02:57:42,120
Oh, sorry.

6242
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:45,360
I keep timing out of my game and then clicking back in.

6243
02:57:46,600 --> 02:57:48,120
Just right click back in, that's what I do.

6244
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:48,960
Oh, that's good.

6245
02:57:50,300 --> 02:57:51,040
Behind you, Haru.

6246
02:57:52,840 --> 02:57:53,240
Oh.

6247
02:57:53,240 --> 02:57:53,400
Oh.

6248
02:57:58,180 --> 02:58:00,540
It says stay out of the line of fire.

6249
02:58:00,660 --> 02:58:02,060
Wow, this is such a beautiful scene.

6250
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,520
Oh, sorry, you scared me.

6251
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,320
Don't come running up on me, old man.

6252
02:58:09,740 --> 02:58:13,080
I was just looking over.

6253
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:15,500
Wait, did you fall?

6254
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:16,840
Yeah, I did.

6255
02:58:19,360 --> 02:58:20,320
Oopsie poopsie.

6256
02:58:20,440 --> 02:58:21,860
Oh, there's a smoker nearby.

6257
02:58:24,260 --> 02:58:24,740
Help!

6258
02:58:26,820 --> 02:58:28,260
Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!

6259
02:58:28,760 --> 02:58:30,320
Smoker, smoker, smoker, you got her?

6260
02:58:30,520 --> 02:58:30,740
Yep.

6261
02:58:31,800 --> 02:58:32,600
I got you.

6262
02:58:33,740 --> 02:58:35,800
Listen, we both can like the number four.

6263
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:37,560
Good job, girl.

6264
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:40,180
Take your medicine.

6265
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:40,980
Good job!

6266
02:58:41,240 --> 02:58:42,120
Wait, what about me?

6267
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:47,300
My brain's not calm enough to meditate right now.

6268
02:58:47,480 --> 02:58:47,780
Okay.

6269
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,360
So I need to find a nice, calm spot to meditate.

6270
02:58:50,540 --> 02:58:50,980
You know what I'm saying?

6271
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:52,660
There's a thing to blow up.

6272
02:58:53,940 --> 02:58:54,860
Blow it up, Min.

6273
02:58:55,060 --> 02:58:55,460
No!

6274
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:56,780
Listen to the demons in your head.

6275
02:58:56,820 --> 02:58:58,060
There's no reason to...

6276
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:06,620
Reloading.

6277
02:59:08,940 --> 02:59:09,340
Smoker?

6278
02:59:09,940 --> 02:59:11,280
I hardly even know her.

6279
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:12,160
Is it this way?

6280
02:59:13,220 --> 02:59:13,620
Careful.

6281
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:16,980
For funsies, what if there was enemies?

6282
02:59:17,640 --> 02:59:19,180
What if we had to go that way?

6283
02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:21,100
Well, we could wait.

6284
02:59:21,920 --> 02:59:23,100
Uh-oh, I hear music.

6285
02:59:23,600 --> 02:59:24,520
I hear a little guy.

6286
02:59:25,020 --> 02:59:25,420
Nice.

6287
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:28,360
I got the boomer.

6288
02:59:28,360 --> 02:59:28,620
This way?

6289
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:32,020
I killed Matarakon.

6290
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:34,680
It's so weird seeing Peter's head being ripped apart.

6291
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:36,140
We're on date.

6292
02:59:37,640 --> 02:59:40,580
Honestly, living with you is worse than death.

6293
02:59:42,160 --> 02:59:43,360
I don't even live.

6294
02:59:43,460 --> 02:59:44,560
You're not living with me at all.

6295
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:44,940
Oh, sorry.

6296
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:46,860
It's okay.

6297
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:48,220
I like to get shot by you.

6298
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:49,560
Oh, nice!

6299
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:51,840
You can shoot me as many times as you want.

6300
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:52,820
Yay!

6301
02:59:54,140 --> 02:59:55,120
Is that a spear?

6302
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:56,840
I'm gonna bleed out here soon, guys.

6303
02:59:56,940 --> 02:59:57,880
I just wanna let you know.

6304
02:59:58,140 --> 03:00:01,260
I'll bleed it out, take it deeper just to throw it away.

6305
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:02,720
Wait, there's a safe house!

6306
03:00:02,880 --> 03:00:03,440
Safe house!

6307
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:03,840
Safe house!

6308
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:05,680
Safe house!

6309
03:00:06,760 --> 03:00:07,700
Safe house!

6310
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:10,540
Safe house!

6311
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:12,800
I'll bleed out in here.

6312
03:00:13,220 --> 03:00:14,340
I'll bleed it out.

6313
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:17,560
Get your bombs and your coffee.

6314
03:00:18,860 --> 03:00:19,820
Look at her go.

6315
03:00:20,020 --> 03:00:22,360
Silver the hedgehog.

6316
03:00:23,380 --> 03:00:23,900
Oh.

6317
03:00:26,240 --> 03:00:26,880
Let's go!

6318
03:00:27,820 --> 03:00:28,020
Yeah!

6319
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:38,320
I only did the most damage because she was on top of me.

6320
03:00:40,880 --> 03:00:43,080
That's the most action you'll ever get.

6321
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:44,420
It's true, actually.

6322
03:00:45,460 --> 03:00:48,300
Dang, why'd you have to tell the truth like that?

6323
03:00:48,640 --> 03:00:50,900
Why are you such a truther?

6324
03:00:51,320 --> 03:00:53,160
Girls, get your health packs.

6325
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:54,940
Get your meds.

6326
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:56,040
Get your medpacks.

6327
03:00:56,180 --> 03:00:57,240
That was a good meditation.

6328
03:00:58,380 --> 03:01:00,500
There's a molotov and a pipe bomb.

6329
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:02,200
And a pipe dream.

6330
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:06,000
No, it doesn't three days.

6331
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:07,380
What's a better gun, everybody?

6332
03:01:07,540 --> 03:01:07,780
This one?

6333
03:01:08,040 --> 03:01:08,600
Number one?

6334
03:01:09,540 --> 03:01:10,560
Or this one?

6335
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:12,600
It takes four days to change?

6336
03:01:12,780 --> 03:01:13,620
No, it doesn't.

6337
03:01:13,620 --> 03:01:15,340
It takes two and a half hours.

6338
03:01:15,360 --> 03:01:15,840
Number two.

6339
03:01:17,140 --> 03:01:18,780
Or this one, number three.

6340
03:01:18,940 --> 03:01:20,380
They only come out at night.

6341
03:01:20,540 --> 03:01:21,300
That's not true!

6342
03:01:21,420 --> 03:01:22,040
They're here all the time!

6343
03:01:22,040 --> 03:01:24,520
No zombie is safe.

6344
03:01:24,640 --> 03:01:25,480
No zombie.

6345
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:27,040
I'm keeping this gun.

6346
03:01:27,740 --> 03:01:30,600
I saw it happen in five minutes.

6347
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:31,360
Let's go!

6348
03:01:31,900 --> 03:01:33,020
Two and a half hours.

6349
03:01:33,240 --> 03:01:34,060
Did we take all the medkits?

6350
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:35,020
Let's fucking go!

6351
03:01:35,640 --> 03:01:36,660
Let's fucking go!

6352
03:01:36,980 --> 03:01:38,040
Kill, kill, kill!

6353
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:40,960
Oh, I should've reloaded.

6354
03:01:41,220 --> 03:01:42,000
That's embarrassing.

6355
03:01:42,580 --> 03:01:43,680
His little butt!

6356
03:01:43,800 --> 03:01:45,080
I saw his little butt!

6357
03:01:45,820 --> 03:01:47,460
I saw his little buttsy!

6358
03:01:48,040 --> 03:01:48,920
That's embarrassing.

6359
03:01:50,220 --> 03:01:51,260
So embarrassing.

6360
03:01:51,380 --> 03:01:51,860
Oh my god.

6361
03:01:52,040 --> 03:01:53,240
Why was your butt out like that?

6362
03:01:53,360 --> 03:01:55,660
Are you showing your butt?

6363
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:57,680
So embarrassing.

6364
03:02:00,840 --> 03:02:01,360
Hello?

6365
03:02:01,780 --> 03:02:02,300
Hello?

6366
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:02,800
Hello?

6367
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:06,120
Oh god!

6368
03:02:06,260 --> 03:02:07,640
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

6369
03:02:08,420 --> 03:02:09,040
Oh my!

6370
03:02:10,620 --> 03:02:12,540
There's a boomer up in here!

6371
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:13,740
What the?

6372
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:14,560
What the?

6373
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:18,940
My god, I had help and now I don't.

6374
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:19,520
What's going on?

6375
03:02:19,880 --> 03:02:20,680
Was it here?

6376
03:02:22,040 --> 03:02:24,700
Which one of you non-Americans shot me?

6377
03:02:25,800 --> 03:02:26,280
Whoa!

6378
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:27,020
Hi!

6379
03:02:28,840 --> 03:02:29,820
No, no, come back!

6380
03:02:30,020 --> 03:02:31,040
I got him!

6381
03:02:35,920 --> 03:02:37,380
I think the jockey just...

6382
03:02:37,380 --> 03:02:40,420
I think he just fell to his death.

6383
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:43,640
That was so funny.

6384
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:44,880
I listened to him scream.

6385
03:02:45,460 --> 03:02:46,920
I've heard his final words.

6386
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:50,420
Oh, how do I get up here?

6387
03:02:50,660 --> 03:02:51,520
Wait, how do I get up here?

6388
03:02:51,640 --> 03:02:53,360
You climb, bitch!

6389
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:54,540
I'm trying!

6390
03:02:54,980 --> 03:02:55,820
Oh, this way.

6391
03:02:56,020 --> 03:02:56,520
Right here?

6392
03:02:58,460 --> 03:03:00,300
Oh, this guy looks like a Batman!

6393
03:03:02,960 --> 03:03:04,460
Oh, this is the perfect time for a sniper.

6394
03:03:05,980 --> 03:03:06,800
Oh my!

6395
03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:07,960
Get away from me!

6396
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:10,420
Get away from me!

6397
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:11,100
I'm talking to you!

6398
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:12,220
I'm talking to you, Batara!

6399
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:12,420
You freak!

6400
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:14,360
Get away from me, you freak!

6401
03:03:15,620 --> 03:03:17,400
But are you still obsessed with me?

6402
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:21,360
I'm not even listening to you anymore.

6403
03:03:21,960 --> 03:03:23,900
I'm not even listening to you anymore.

6404
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:26,600
I'm not even listening to you anymore.

6405
03:03:26,620 --> 03:03:27,820
I think we have to go down here.

6406
03:03:28,220 --> 03:03:28,600
I think we have to go down here.

6407
03:03:32,520 --> 03:03:33,720
I didn't miss.

6408
03:03:33,740 --> 03:03:35,080
I didn't miss at all.

6409
03:03:35,240 --> 03:03:35,720
Obviously.

6410
03:03:36,720 --> 03:03:38,200
Yeah, that would be crazy if I missed.

6411
03:03:40,140 --> 03:03:40,860
Why do I...

6412
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:41,780
Sorry.

6413
03:03:45,240 --> 03:03:46,480
Help me, please!

6414
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:47,320
I'm kidding!

6415
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:48,880
I'm in an anime!

6416
03:03:49,380 --> 03:03:50,580
Batara, I'm not Batara.

6417
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:51,160
I'm coming.

6418
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:51,740
Okay, never mind.

6419
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:55,120
Did you just talk to yourself in the third frame?

6420
03:03:56,040 --> 03:03:58,720
I called you Batara by accident.

6421
03:03:59,180 --> 03:04:01,200
Listen, I am all video-gamed out.

6422
03:04:01,340 --> 03:04:02,240
I have like...

6423
03:04:02,240 --> 03:04:05,200
I am old and this game is a lot for my old woman brain.

6424
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,040
It is a lot.

6425
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:07,080
It is so much.

6426
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:07,500
It's okay.

6427
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:10,080
I'm Batara now, everybody.

6428
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:11,840
Hi, honey.

6429
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:12,260
Hi, honey.

6430
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:17,080
There's a grenade launcher here if anyone wants to...

6431
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:18,280
Wait, there's a medkit over here!

6432
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:19,420
And boobies.

6433
03:04:20,660 --> 03:04:23,320
There's a medkit, there's an ammo, and there's a gun.

6434
03:04:23,800 --> 03:04:25,960
Why do you say like it's a bad thing that I like boobies, you know?

6435
03:04:25,980 --> 03:04:30,700
I love boobies and cute girls and cute girls with boobies.

6436
03:04:31,600 --> 03:04:32,080
Hana!

6437
03:04:32,840 --> 03:04:33,320
Hana!

6438
03:04:33,600 --> 03:04:35,280
There's a grenade launcher over here.

6439
03:04:35,380 --> 03:04:36,800
I like my gun.

6440
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:38,020
I love you.

6441
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:40,100
Take it.

6442
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:40,840
Take it.

6443
03:04:40,880 --> 03:04:41,200
Take it.

6444
03:04:41,580 --> 03:04:42,560
Rescue's coming, girls.

6445
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:45,820
Let's all stand together and then...

6446
03:04:45,820 --> 03:04:46,100
Yeah.

6447
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:49,720
Ice cream!

6448
03:04:50,120 --> 03:04:50,300
Wait.

6449
03:04:50,820 --> 03:04:51,800
I'm throwing...

6450
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:53,800
I'm throwing...

6451
03:04:53,800 --> 03:04:56,760
I'm throwing gasoline if anyone wants to blow it up.

6452
03:04:58,020 --> 03:05:00,120
Okay, maybe I like my gun better.

6453
03:05:06,110 --> 03:05:06,630
Spitter.

6454
03:05:07,410 --> 03:05:08,270
What is a spitter?

6455
03:05:08,450 --> 03:05:09,190
I don't know.

6456
03:05:10,550 --> 03:05:11,350
Oh my gosh.

6457
03:05:14,450 --> 03:05:15,490
Can you?

6458
03:05:15,770 --> 03:05:16,290
No!

6459
03:05:17,390 --> 03:05:18,150
I got you.

6460
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:18,530
I got you.

6461
03:05:18,630 --> 03:05:19,530
No, no, no, no!

6462
03:05:21,890 --> 03:05:22,850
Wait, who did I just see?

6463
03:05:22,850 --> 03:05:24,570
I'm here trying to help Hania but I need your guys...

6464
03:05:24,570 --> 03:05:26,410
Hania, can you keep shooting the ones in front of you?

6465
03:05:26,490 --> 03:05:26,770
I'm trying.

6466
03:05:26,890 --> 03:05:27,130
I'm trying.

6467
03:05:27,250 --> 03:05:27,510
I'm trying.

6468
03:05:28,130 --> 03:05:28,850
Oh, no!

6469
03:05:29,030 --> 03:05:29,930
Oh, I got the jockey.

6470
03:05:30,170 --> 03:05:30,970
I got the jockey.

6471
03:05:31,490 --> 03:05:32,350
I can't help you.

6472
03:05:32,430 --> 03:05:33,530
I'm saving Hania.

6473
03:05:33,730 --> 03:05:34,190
It's okay.

6474
03:05:35,410 --> 03:05:37,270
I'll just die, I think, actually.

6475
03:05:38,990 --> 03:05:39,310
Die.

6476
03:05:40,490 --> 03:05:41,190
Yeah, I'm down.

6477
03:05:42,350 --> 03:05:42,930
I'm sorry.

6478
03:05:43,050 --> 03:05:43,510
I was down.

6479
03:05:43,610 --> 03:05:44,370
I wasn't near you.

6480
03:05:47,630 --> 03:05:48,450
Hania, are you okay?

6481
03:05:48,550 --> 03:05:49,110
Use your med kit.

6482
03:05:49,110 --> 03:05:49,850
Okay.

6483
03:05:50,110 --> 03:05:50,510
Okay.

6484
03:05:50,590 --> 03:05:51,490
Oh, sorry if I shot you.

6485
03:05:52,470 --> 03:05:53,530
Use your med kit, Hania.

6486
03:05:54,430 --> 03:05:57,730
There was med kit nearby me, but I don't know if you guys heard me.

6487
03:05:58,150 --> 03:05:58,550
I...

6488
03:05:58,550 --> 03:05:59,590
Yeah, we're coming.

6489
03:05:59,650 --> 03:05:59,930
We're coming.

6490
03:06:00,030 --> 03:06:03,130
I have one, so I just gotta get revived and I'll be good.

6491
03:06:03,410 --> 03:06:04,950
Mint, I'm coming, you jerk.

6492
03:06:05,550 --> 03:06:06,250
Oh, a spitter?

6493
03:06:06,910 --> 03:06:07,730
Francis, let's go!

6494
03:06:07,830 --> 03:06:08,110
Get up!

6495
03:06:08,550 --> 03:06:09,250
He's a quitter.

6496
03:06:09,430 --> 03:06:09,830
Francis?

6497
03:06:10,210 --> 03:06:11,030
Who's Francis?

6498
03:06:11,290 --> 03:06:11,890
Oh, that's me.

6499
03:06:11,970 --> 03:06:12,910
Who's Francis?

6500
03:06:14,350 --> 03:06:16,870
Haha, he's showing his butt.

6501
03:06:16,870 --> 03:06:17,630
So embarrassing.

6502
03:06:18,890 --> 03:06:19,730
Look at me.

6503
03:06:20,510 --> 03:06:23,930
Uh, I'm reloading.

6504
03:06:23,970 --> 03:06:24,290
I'm reloading.

6505
03:06:24,310 --> 03:06:25,010
Oh, you got him, though.

6506
03:06:27,310 --> 03:06:27,810
Hehe.

6507
03:06:27,810 --> 03:06:28,750
Silly zombies.

6508
03:06:30,370 --> 03:06:31,530
What do you think?

6509
03:06:32,690 --> 03:06:33,190
Tank?

6510
03:06:35,110 --> 03:06:36,290
Oh, it's behind you.

6511
03:06:36,310 --> 03:06:36,650
It's behind you.

6512
03:06:36,670 --> 03:06:37,490
I got taken.

6513
03:06:38,870 --> 03:06:39,630
Thank you, Hadu.

6514
03:06:39,750 --> 03:06:40,510
My angel.

6515
03:06:41,810 --> 03:06:42,490
Uh-oh.

6516
03:06:43,310 --> 03:06:44,030
Metal Gear!

6517
03:06:45,210 --> 03:06:45,710
No!

6518
03:06:47,310 --> 03:06:47,990
Oh, my gosh.

6519
03:06:48,250 --> 03:06:48,690
Throw!

6520
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:50,190
I'm throwing a pipe bomb!

6521
03:06:50,370 --> 03:06:50,710
Uh-oh.

6522
03:06:50,710 --> 03:06:50,990
Wait.

6523
03:06:51,090 --> 03:06:51,650
Oh, oh.

6524
03:06:51,750 --> 03:06:52,030
Oh,

6525
03:06:59,560 --> 03:07:00,420
my gosh.

6526
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:01,200
Please reload!

6527
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:02,440
What's taking so long?

6528
03:07:02,760 --> 03:07:04,100
What was taking so long?

6529
03:07:06,040 --> 03:07:06,480
Hadu!

6530
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:07,740
I got you!

6531
03:07:08,280 --> 03:07:08,920
Oh, fuck.

6532
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:09,600
I couldn't hide that.

6533
03:07:12,100 --> 03:07:12,980
Thank you!

6534
03:07:14,140 --> 03:07:14,820
Thank you!

6535
03:07:14,820 --> 03:07:16,860
Oh, my gosh.

6536
03:07:19,540 --> 03:07:20,420
Get rekt.

6537
03:07:20,420 --> 03:07:21,020
Vile spitter down.

6538
03:07:21,180 --> 03:07:21,780
Vile spitter down.

6539
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:22,220
I see her.

6540
03:07:22,220 --> 03:07:23,680
Oh, Minc.

6541
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:24,020
Minc.

6542
03:07:24,060 --> 03:07:24,860
I can heal you.

6543
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:25,280
Oh!

6544
03:07:25,420 --> 03:07:26,820
Where are you?

6545
03:07:33,480 --> 03:07:34,020
I'll guard.

6546
03:07:34,100 --> 03:07:34,720
I'll guard.

6547
03:07:38,350 --> 03:07:39,390
Thank you!

6548
03:07:40,250 --> 03:07:41,150
Thank you!

6549
03:07:42,890 --> 03:07:44,050
My angel!

6550
03:07:44,850 --> 03:07:45,730
You're such an angel.

6551
03:07:45,990 --> 03:07:46,870
You're such a genius!

6552
03:07:47,670 --> 03:07:48,370
I'm a genius!

6553
03:07:51,930 --> 03:07:52,970
So cute!

6554
03:07:55,970 --> 03:07:58,190
Guys, I'm gonna throw a pipe bomb in the middle.

6555
03:07:58,190 --> 03:07:58,210
Oh, my God!

6556
03:08:01,670 --> 03:08:03,310
I'm not a guy.

6557
03:08:06,070 --> 03:08:07,510
Minc, get out of the way.

6558
03:08:07,590 --> 03:08:08,410
I'm trying to.

6559
03:08:08,450 --> 03:08:09,210
I'm trying to.

6560
03:08:09,230 --> 03:08:10,050
Minc, get out of the way.

6561
03:08:10,050 --> 03:08:10,490
I'm trying!

6562
03:08:13,370 --> 03:08:15,150
Is there any ammo anywhere?

6563
03:08:16,010 --> 03:08:16,450
Yes.

6564
03:08:16,910 --> 03:08:18,130
On a lot of spots.

6565
03:08:18,450 --> 03:08:18,850
There is?

6566
03:08:19,110 --> 03:08:20,350
Why can't I find anything?

6567
03:08:21,290 --> 03:08:21,870
Oh, here.

6568
03:08:21,970 --> 03:08:22,070
Here.

6569
03:08:22,110 --> 03:08:22,650
Oh, thank God.

6570
03:08:25,070 --> 03:08:25,510
Reloading.

6571
03:08:28,190 --> 03:08:28,870
Why are you in the hole?

6572
03:08:29,090 --> 03:08:29,530
Oh, big guy.

6573
03:08:29,590 --> 03:08:29,810
Big guy.

6574
03:08:30,870 --> 03:08:31,370
Oh, fuck.

6575
03:08:31,450 --> 03:08:32,090
I need help.

6576
03:08:32,170 --> 03:08:32,670
I got him.

6577
03:08:33,330 --> 03:08:34,030
Thank you, girl.

6578
03:08:34,950 --> 03:08:35,590
You're welcome.

6579
03:08:36,410 --> 03:08:38,630
See, isn't it a good thing that I reloaded?

6580
03:08:38,990 --> 03:08:40,010
Oh, I need to go.

6581
03:08:40,210 --> 03:08:40,870
He's gonna die.

6582
03:08:40,930 --> 03:08:41,350
Thank you.

6583
03:08:46,110 --> 03:08:46,430
Die!

6584
03:08:46,810 --> 03:08:47,130
Zombie!

6585
03:08:48,670 --> 03:08:53,230
I like when their body parts fly everywhere.

6586
03:08:54,350 --> 03:08:54,810
Getting tongue.

6587
03:08:54,850 --> 03:08:55,310
Getting tongue.

6588
03:08:55,310 --> 03:08:55,670
Getting tongue.

6589
03:08:55,890 --> 03:08:57,130
Oh, where are you?

6590
03:08:57,650 --> 03:08:58,470
Oh, I got you.

6591
03:08:58,570 --> 03:08:58,750
I got you.

6592
03:08:58,930 --> 03:08:59,650
I'm in a weird spot.

6593
03:09:00,750 --> 03:09:01,550
I'm reloading.

6594
03:09:01,570 --> 03:09:01,770
I'm reloading.

6595
03:09:05,710 --> 03:09:06,430
Are you good?

6596
03:09:07,150 --> 03:09:07,550
Oh,

6597
03:09:11,700 --> 03:09:13,040
I can't see.

6598
03:09:13,880 --> 03:09:14,420
Uh-oh.

6599
03:09:15,440 --> 03:09:16,000
Oh, gosh.

6600
03:09:16,120 --> 03:09:16,820
Get off of me.

6601
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:18,080
Get off me, stupid zombie.

6602
03:09:21,020 --> 03:09:21,640
Oh, sorry.

6603
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:22,000
That's you.

6604
03:09:29,360 --> 03:09:32,320
This is a really long we're coming to save you guys.

6605
03:09:32,520 --> 03:09:33,120
I know, right?

6606
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:34,880
Clearly.

6607
03:09:34,940 --> 03:09:36,040
Oh, I'm pinned.

6608
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:37,680
I'm pinned.

6609
03:09:38,100 --> 03:09:38,580
Oh, thank you.

6610
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:40,620
Minc, there's ammo up here if you come to us.

6611
03:09:40,860 --> 03:09:41,760
There's tank here.

6612
03:09:41,820 --> 03:09:42,540
I hear Thanos.

6613
03:09:42,820 --> 03:09:43,300
I'm coming.

6614
03:09:43,480 --> 03:09:43,720
I'm coming.

6615
03:09:44,640 --> 03:09:45,920
The tank is coming.

6616
03:09:46,660 --> 03:09:47,760
Do we have any...

6617
03:09:48,520 --> 03:09:48,960
He's here.

6618
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:49,120
He's here.

6619
03:09:49,220 --> 03:09:49,860
I see him.

6620
03:09:49,900 --> 03:09:50,360
I see him.

6621
03:09:50,420 --> 03:09:51,000
Oh, wait.

6622
03:09:51,080 --> 03:09:51,900
I can't go this way.

6623
03:09:52,100 --> 03:09:53,000
Bombs away anywhere?

6624
03:09:55,820 --> 03:09:56,860
Any waddle the way.

6625
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:57,820
Waddle, waddle.

6626
03:09:58,700 --> 03:09:59,140
Get him.

6627
03:09:59,200 --> 03:09:59,360
Get him.

6628
03:09:59,380 --> 03:09:59,540
Get him.

6629
03:09:59,620 --> 03:10:00,340
Waddle, waddle.

6630
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:01,800
Metal Gear, I'm sorry.

6631
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:03,660
I love you.

6632
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:05,760
I'm sorry.

6633
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:06,380
Oh, my gosh.

6634
03:10:06,400 --> 03:10:07,120
You scared me.

6635
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:07,900
I'm sorry.

6636
03:10:08,020 --> 03:10:08,720
You scared me.

6637
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:09,480
The chopper's here.

6638
03:10:10,360 --> 03:10:11,600
Oh, the chopper's here.

6639
03:10:11,940 --> 03:10:13,020
Guys, boomer.

6640
03:10:14,840 --> 03:10:16,540
And we got a final ward.

6641
03:10:17,260 --> 03:10:17,900
Where do we go?

6642
03:10:18,200 --> 03:10:18,300
Final ward?

6643
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:18,660
Fuck.

6644
03:10:20,740 --> 03:10:22,240
Please don't shoot me up right here.

6645
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:23,440
Oh, guys.

6646
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:24,660
There's a charger behind us.

6647
03:10:25,980 --> 03:10:27,020
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

6648
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:27,900
Can you revive me, please?

6649
03:10:28,820 --> 03:10:31,240
I don't know about that.

6650
03:10:31,720 --> 03:10:32,240
I don't know about that.

6651
03:10:32,260 --> 03:10:33,740
Minc, I'm gonna shoot you.

6652
03:10:35,180 --> 03:10:36,280
Oh, there's another tank.

6653
03:10:36,840 --> 03:10:37,440
Oh, my God.

6654
03:10:38,720 --> 03:10:38,860
Are you coming?

6655
03:10:41,540 --> 03:10:43,320
I'm just gonna chill in here, honestly.

6656
03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:44,580
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

6657
03:10:44,980 --> 03:10:46,640
This is an exclusive club.

6658
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:48,040
Shit.

6659
03:10:50,220 --> 03:10:50,820
Oh, my God.

6660
03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:51,620
Oh, my God.

6661
03:10:52,600 --> 03:10:52,960
Metal.

6662
03:10:52,960 --> 03:10:53,460
Oh, no.

6663
03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:54,460
Brax, please.

6664
03:10:54,820 --> 03:10:56,540
Haru, Haru, jump, jump, jump, Haru.

6665
03:10:56,840 --> 03:10:58,180
Haru, come, come, come.

6666
03:10:58,340 --> 03:10:58,940
There we go.

6667
03:11:02,240 --> 03:11:04,280
I punched the shit out of that tank.

6668
03:11:04,900 --> 03:11:05,520
Good job.

6669
03:11:06,320 --> 03:11:07,060
Look at him.

6670
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:08,420
Look, he's so cute down there.

6671
03:11:09,660 --> 03:11:10,100
Okay.

6672
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:10,880
No, look at him.

6673
03:11:10,940 --> 03:11:11,540
He's so upset.

6674
03:11:11,680 --> 03:11:13,020
Yeah, he looks so upset.

6675
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:13,520
He's so upset.

6676
03:11:13,700 --> 03:11:14,780
Yeah, he looks mad.

6677
03:11:15,900 --> 03:11:16,700
He's so cute.

6678
03:11:17,620 --> 03:11:18,720
Oh, he just fell down.

6679
03:11:23,860 --> 03:11:24,300
Okay.

6680
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:25,440
Yeah, baby.

6681
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:26,140
We did it.

6682
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:26,960
Yeah.

6683
03:11:29,620 --> 03:11:31,480
I'm so tired from...

6684
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:34,740
This game is so overwhelming, but it was so much fun.

6685
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:35,740
It was.

6686
03:11:35,740 --> 03:11:36,580
Thank you.

6687
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:37,900
Yeah.

6688
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,480
Yeah, we can.

6689
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:41,020
We can.

6690
03:11:41,320 --> 03:11:42,480
Zero deaths.

6691
03:11:42,560 --> 03:11:43,800
Let's go, baby.

6692
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:46,120
We owe zero deaths.

6693
03:11:46,140 --> 03:11:47,340
All zero deaths.

6694
03:11:47,820 --> 03:11:48,720
All zero deaths.

6695
03:11:48,900 --> 03:11:49,280
Nice.

6696
03:11:49,280 --> 03:11:50,360
Drugs used me.

6697
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:52,960
I bombed me.

6698
03:11:53,080 --> 03:11:54,580
You have a bit of a problem, baby.

6699
03:11:57,980 --> 03:11:59,640
Well, the melee kills.

6700
03:11:59,820 --> 03:12:00,160
Nice.

6701
03:12:01,940 --> 03:12:03,040
Good job, girl.

6702
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:04,340
That was so much fun.

6703
03:12:04,420 --> 03:12:04,680
Yeah.

6704
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:07,640
Nice.

6705
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:08,420
That was so fun.

6706
03:12:09,320 --> 03:12:09,840
Nice.

6707
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:13,640
I'm sorry if I yelled a bit much.

6708
03:12:13,700 --> 03:12:15,500
Girl, this is a yelling game.

6709
03:12:15,580 --> 03:12:16,900
Don't worry about it.

6710
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:18,800
This is a yelling game.

6711
03:12:18,800 --> 03:12:20,460
Okay, I'm sorry for the 51.

6712
03:12:21,720 --> 03:12:23,780
It was you last time, too.

6713
03:12:24,040 --> 03:12:24,880
Oh, my gosh.

6714
03:12:26,100 --> 03:12:27,840
I revived the most.

6715
03:12:27,900 --> 03:12:29,900
I protected and I healed the most.

6716
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:32,340
Still getting that head shot, baby.

6717
03:12:33,520 --> 03:12:34,480
You're perfect.

6718
03:12:34,960 --> 03:12:36,600
Girl, you got 11%.

6719
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:37,320
It's nothing to brag about.

6720
03:12:37,400 --> 03:12:38,840
That's still better than you.

6721
03:12:41,800 --> 03:12:43,100
That was a lot of fun.

6722
03:12:43,560 --> 03:12:45,140
Yeah, thank you for playing.

6723
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:45,780
It was nice to revisit this game again.

6724
03:12:45,940 --> 03:12:46,680
I know, right?

6725
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:47,560
It was fun.

6726
03:12:47,620 --> 03:12:50,960
I feel like I can only play it once a year.

6727
03:12:51,420 --> 03:12:52,380
I know, right?

6728
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:54,800
Oh, man.

6729
03:12:55,460 --> 03:12:56,760
It was fun.

6730
03:12:56,980 --> 03:12:57,940
It's so overwhelming.

6731
03:12:58,320 --> 03:12:58,800
It is very.

6732
03:13:03,180 --> 03:13:03,700
Yeah.

6733
03:13:05,540 --> 03:13:07,740
Who is still going to stream for a bit?

6734
03:13:07,880 --> 03:13:08,200
Me.

6735
03:13:08,440 --> 03:13:08,960
Okay.

6736
03:13:10,460 --> 03:13:12,480
Mint, we're going to do something fun.

6737
03:13:12,560 --> 03:13:15,300
I'm going to try to give you a manual raid on your YouTube.

6738
03:13:15,420 --> 03:13:15,680
Okay?

6739
03:13:16,140 --> 03:13:18,060
Just act surprised when it happens.

6740
03:13:19,160 --> 03:13:20,200
Manual raid.

6741
03:13:20,520 --> 03:13:21,320
Manual raid.

6742
03:13:22,060 --> 03:13:23,280
Bye-bye, everybody.

6743
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:24,400
Bye-bye.

6744
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:25,680
Bye-bye.

6745
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:27,180
Bye-bye.

6746
03:13:27,960 --> 03:13:29,000
Bye-bye.

6747
03:13:29,140 --> 03:13:29,880
Bye-bye.

6748
03:13:29,980 --> 03:13:30,800
Bye-bye, you smell.

6749
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:36,140
I smell good.

6750
03:13:37,880 --> 03:13:39,380
I smell delicious.

6751
03:13:39,920 --> 03:13:40,680
Bye, stinky.

6752
03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:41,520
Bye.

6753
03:13:41,780 --> 03:13:43,860
She said stinky.

6754
03:13:43,860 --> 03:13:45,480
She thinks both of us are stinky.

6755
03:13:45,840 --> 03:13:47,660
I'm stinky in a good way.

6756
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:49,780
I'm a minty stinky, you know?

6757
03:13:50,660 --> 03:13:52,720
God, I love the smell of mint.

6758
03:13:52,860 --> 03:13:53,160
I know.

6759
03:13:54,400 --> 03:13:54,800
I know.

6760
03:13:55,620 --> 03:13:56,940
Why did I say it like that?

6761
03:13:57,980 --> 03:13:58,620
I know.

6762
03:14:00,740 --> 03:14:01,140
Bye.

6763
03:14:01,880 --> 03:14:02,280
Bye.

6764
03:14:03,840 --> 03:14:04,420
Bye-bye.

6765
03:14:10,780 --> 03:14:11,580
Hold on.

6766
03:14:11,640 --> 03:14:12,340
Give me a second.

6767
03:14:12,420 --> 03:14:13,020
I need to...

6768
03:14:14,220 --> 03:14:18,320
I need to actually, like, simmer down from all that craziness.

6769
03:14:18,380 --> 03:14:21,320
Every time I play that game, it is so...

6770
03:14:21,320 --> 03:14:25,200
Just all yelling, all running, all screaming.

6771
03:14:25,660 --> 03:14:27,700
It is just a crazy...

6772
03:14:27,700 --> 03:14:29,160
Okay, you guys, let's relax now.

6773
03:14:29,360 --> 03:14:30,040
Actually, hold on.

6774
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:31,200
This is called Rain Relax.

6775
03:14:31,320 --> 03:14:32,000
What does it sound like?

6776
03:14:34,820 --> 03:14:35,760
What's it sound like?

6777
03:14:36,480 --> 03:14:37,520
Oh, okay.

6778
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:39,040
This is relaxing.

6779
03:14:39,720 --> 03:14:41,180
Yeah, we're relaxed.

6780
03:14:44,940 --> 03:14:45,460
Oh.

6781
03:14:45,980 --> 03:14:46,500
Oh.

6782
03:14:47,240 --> 03:14:47,760
Ah.

6783
03:14:51,220 --> 03:14:51,880
Oh.

6784
03:14:52,920 --> 03:14:55,120
Nice to see you playing it for the first time with Henya.

6785
03:14:55,320 --> 03:14:55,840
Yeah.

6786
03:14:56,780 --> 03:14:58,040
She's such a gamer.

6787
03:14:58,380 --> 03:14:59,700
Thank you.

6788
03:15:00,880 --> 03:15:01,540
Fun.

6789
03:15:03,800 --> 03:15:04,800
Thank you.

6790
03:15:12,540 --> 03:15:15,420
Mint carried not even a little bit.

6791
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:18,900
Not even a fraction.

6792
03:15:18,900 --> 03:15:22,780
Well, I guess technically a fraction because I was in the game.

6793
03:15:23,060 --> 03:15:23,280
But...

6794
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:26,220
Takizo, thank you for the five gifted.

6795
03:15:26,220 --> 03:15:27,360
Thank you so much.

6796
03:15:27,620 --> 03:15:28,180
Thank you.

6797
03:15:28,240 --> 03:15:29,780
Oh, why are notives not on here?

6798
03:15:29,960 --> 03:15:31,120
Okay, now they're showing up.

6799
03:15:31,600 --> 03:15:32,280
Sorry about that.

6800
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:36,200
You were MVP at one point.

6801
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:38,660
Notives are off the screen.

6802
03:15:38,740 --> 03:15:39,260
Yeah, I noticed.

6803
03:15:39,360 --> 03:15:39,740
Thank you.

6804
03:15:41,360 --> 03:15:42,640
Murphy, thanks for the 20.

6805
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:44,620
Oh my gosh, I'm feeling so relaxed right now.

6806
03:15:46,920 --> 03:15:48,360
Oh, K4, thanks for the 10.

6807
03:15:48,700 --> 03:15:49,960
AKSJF2, thank you for the 10.

6808
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:52,620
Oh, Doug dim a dome carry.

6809
03:15:52,880 --> 03:15:53,300
Actually.

6810
03:15:54,940 --> 03:15:57,900
Oh my gosh, it was so fun to see Ray and then also Rex.

6811
03:15:58,520 --> 03:15:59,280
Oh my gosh, it was so fun to see Ray and then also Rex.

6812
03:15:59,680 --> 03:16:00,760
It was so fun.

6813
03:16:01,420 --> 03:16:02,580
So fun, so fun.

6814
03:16:02,760 --> 03:16:04,440
Raymac, thank you for the five gifted.

6815
03:16:04,680 --> 03:16:05,100
Oh.

6816
03:16:08,080 --> 03:16:10,060
Sorry if that was just like...

6817
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:11,420
Sorry if that was just like...

6818
03:16:11,420 --> 03:16:12,040
Everything overload.

6819
03:16:12,040 --> 03:16:13,560
I know it was for me.

6820
03:16:13,660 --> 03:16:14,840
Holy cow.

6821
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:19,960
But it was... it was fun.

6822
03:16:20,240 --> 03:16:22,380
Your mod choices were top tier.

6823
03:16:22,520 --> 03:16:23,000
Thanks.

6824
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:26,420
I like looked really hard for some really silly ones.

6825
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:30,560
Thanks for that.

6826
03:16:30,620 --> 03:16:32,940
Haven't seen a good elf for D in a long time.

6827
03:16:34,060 --> 03:16:34,660
Thanks.

6828
03:16:35,440 --> 03:16:37,400
Haru is like really caring.

6829
03:16:38,220 --> 03:16:40,440
It was so funny listening to...

6830
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:42,980
listening to...

6831
03:16:44,200 --> 03:16:46,340
Mata really trying to like...

6832
03:16:46,340 --> 03:16:47,920
ring everybody in.

6833
03:16:48,100 --> 03:16:49,600
And everyone's like, nah.

6834
03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:52,900
I kind of felt bad though.

6835
03:16:53,220 --> 03:16:55,460
Free ice cream!

6836
03:16:55,580 --> 03:16:57,860
I'm gonna hear that in my sleep.

6837
03:16:58,440 --> 03:17:00,500
Yeah, it did get funnier and funnier.

6838
03:17:02,440 --> 03:17:04,480
I was just like...

6839
03:17:04,480 --> 03:17:06,240
You know that picture of like...

6840
03:17:06,240 --> 03:17:10,100
of one person holding on to three different...

6841
03:17:10,100 --> 03:17:10,440
um...

6842
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:12,640
leashes and everyone's going everywhere.

6843
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:14,520
I think that was Matara today.

6844
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:16,320
Oh...

6845
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:18,160
Thanks for the...

6846
03:17:18,160 --> 03:17:20,080
for the ten gifted... thank you.

6847
03:17:20,240 --> 03:17:22,080
Had a rough day dealing with computer issues.

6848
03:17:22,120 --> 03:17:23,160
Glad I could watch...

6849
03:17:23,160 --> 03:17:24,160
Oh wait, hold on.

6850
03:17:24,200 --> 03:17:24,940
Sorry, my music.

6851
03:17:26,320 --> 03:17:29,340
Glad I could watch you girls be goofy.

6852
03:17:29,380 --> 03:17:30,700
To keep my mind off things.

6853
03:17:31,240 --> 03:17:32,280
Yeah, well it's Friday.

6854
03:17:32,600 --> 03:17:33,900
You can also have the weekend.

6855
03:17:35,140 --> 03:17:36,200
To just relax.

6856
03:17:36,920 --> 03:17:38,080
Cool, thanks for the...

6857
03:17:38,080 --> 03:17:39,740
ten gifted...

6858
03:17:40,740 --> 03:17:41,520
thank you.

6859
03:17:42,100 --> 03:17:44,220
Thank you for the fifty gifted...

6860
03:17:44,220 --> 03:17:44,480
Stop!

6861
03:17:44,720 --> 03:17:44,940
Why?

6862
03:17:45,860 --> 03:17:48,240
Also, if you haven't noticed, I fixed the membership thing.

6863
03:17:48,320 --> 03:17:49,540
So the notice won't...

6864
03:17:50,150 --> 03:17:51,520
show up a bajillion times.

6865
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:52,620
And clog it up.

6866
03:17:54,140 --> 03:17:55,380
I figured it out.

6867
03:17:57,120 --> 03:17:58,200
Unfortunately, it won't...

6868
03:17:58,200 --> 03:17:59,540
show like if someone joins normally.

6869
03:17:59,740 --> 03:18:00,820
But I'll try to keep it.

6870
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:01,940
I'll try to...

6871
03:18:03,280 --> 03:18:04,700
notice it when it happens.

6872
03:18:06,200 --> 03:18:07,620
It wasn't really a problem.

6873
03:18:07,820 --> 03:18:09,280
It was just that if someone gifted...

6874
03:18:09,280 --> 03:18:10,140
a lot of...

6875
03:18:12,040 --> 03:18:13,600
memberships, it would just be like...

6876
03:18:13,600 --> 03:18:14,760
So-and-so became a member.

6877
03:18:14,960 --> 03:18:16,440
So-and-so became a member.

6878
03:18:16,800 --> 03:18:19,580
It made the notice...

6879
03:18:19,580 --> 03:18:20,580
really backed up.

6880
03:18:24,980 --> 03:18:27,060
What do you guys have planned for the weekend?

6881
03:18:28,080 --> 03:18:29,420
Mitros, thanks for the ten!

6882
03:18:29,560 --> 03:18:30,940
While the suck things are the five!

6883
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:33,660
Cinco de Mayo this weekend!

6884
03:18:34,040 --> 03:18:34,500
Woo!

6885
03:18:37,980 --> 03:18:38,500
Uh...

6886
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:42,020
Vamanos!

6887
03:18:44,460 --> 03:18:45,580
KBBQ with friends tomorrow?

6888
03:18:45,780 --> 03:18:47,100
Oh my god, that sounds so good!

6889
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:50,120
I haven't had KBBQ in so long!

6890
03:18:52,020 --> 03:18:53,060
Just chillin'.

6891
03:18:53,740 --> 03:18:54,260
Nice.

6892
03:18:54,380 --> 03:18:55,720
Zomboid server with friends?

6893
03:18:55,920 --> 03:18:56,220
Nice.

6894
03:18:56,760 --> 03:18:58,160
You haven't had enough zombies?

6895
03:18:58,240 --> 03:19:00,380
I think I've had... I'm all zommed out.

6896
03:19:01,160 --> 03:19:02,460
I'm zommed out.

6897
03:19:02,740 --> 03:19:04,520
I'm a ghost, not a zombie.

6898
03:19:04,880 --> 03:19:05,680
I'm dead.

6899
03:19:05,940 --> 03:19:06,980
Not undead.

6900
03:19:09,620 --> 03:19:11,740
Going to a convention next two days.

6901
03:19:11,760 --> 03:19:12,620
Sorry if I don't catch the train.

6902
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:13,540
Wait, what con?

6903
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:15,220
What convention is this weekend?

6904
03:19:17,860 --> 03:19:19,520
What convention is this weekend?

6905
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:25,640
I, um...

6906
03:19:26,760 --> 03:19:28,200
Oh, Sawcon!

6907
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:30,920
I think that's every weekend though, actually.

6908
03:19:32,220 --> 03:19:35,840
Why can't I remember Sawcon, but I can't remember the names?

6909
03:19:36,800 --> 03:19:37,840
Oh well.

6910
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:39,180
Plants vs.

6911
03:19:39,300 --> 03:19:40,900
Zombies 15th Anniversary this weekend.

6912
03:19:40,960 --> 03:19:41,640
No way!

6913
03:19:41,780 --> 03:19:42,040
Really?

6914
03:19:42,940 --> 03:19:43,520
Wow.

6915
03:19:45,500 --> 03:19:46,080
Meep!

6916
03:19:46,120 --> 03:19:47,080
Thanks for the 10!

6917
03:19:48,600 --> 03:19:50,520
It's a local convention in Mexico.

6918
03:19:50,820 --> 03:19:51,040
Oh!

6919
03:19:52,140 --> 03:19:52,720
Awesome.

6920
03:19:53,020 --> 03:19:55,140
Wait, they have a convention during Cinco de Mayo?

6921
03:19:57,620 --> 03:19:58,500
I guess...

6922
03:19:58,500 --> 03:20:01,040
I mean, I guess it's kind of the same when like...

6923
03:20:02,420 --> 03:20:03,000
What's it?

6924
03:20:03,780 --> 03:20:06,050
Anime Expo does theirs on...

6925
03:20:06,050 --> 03:20:06,470
on...

6926
03:20:08,990 --> 03:20:09,670
4th of July.

6927
03:20:10,550 --> 03:20:11,230
Thanks, Mint.

6928
03:20:11,350 --> 03:20:12,330
What did I do?

6929
03:20:14,730 --> 03:20:15,090
Hooray!

6930
03:20:15,230 --> 03:20:15,830
Thank you!

6931
03:20:15,910 --> 03:20:17,970
When I started watching you, I just quit my job.

6932
03:20:18,090 --> 03:20:20,850
Leaving was scary, but watching you inspired me to push through the fear.

6933
03:20:21,070 --> 03:20:23,890
One day I start my apprenticeship fixing airplanes!

6934
03:20:24,670 --> 03:20:26,310
Thank you, Mint, for being my push.

6935
03:20:26,450 --> 03:20:26,990
Oh my gosh, Ray.

6936
03:20:27,070 --> 03:20:29,070
We need you in the world right now, actually.

6937
03:20:30,930 --> 03:20:31,570
Oh my gosh.

6938
03:20:31,590 --> 03:20:35,870
I was looking at my flights for some of my upcoming events.

6939
03:20:36,050 --> 03:20:36,750
That I'm going to.

6940
03:20:37,190 --> 03:20:38,370
You guys...

6941
03:20:39,130 --> 03:20:40,890
Two of my flights are Boeing.

6942
03:20:42,850 --> 03:20:46,490
If I don't make it, go on without me.

6943
03:20:46,830 --> 03:20:49,250
I might be seeing the light this...

6944
03:20:49,910 --> 03:20:51,050
Not this weekend.

6945
03:20:54,570 --> 03:20:56,030
Thank you for the gift!

6946
03:20:56,030 --> 03:20:56,750
Thank you!

6947
03:20:59,930 --> 03:21:01,590
But they're not...

6948
03:21:01,590 --> 03:21:03,110
Can I call dibs on your stuff?

6949
03:21:03,150 --> 03:21:03,370
Sure.

6950
03:21:06,690 --> 03:21:11,410
No, it's not the 737 MAX, but it is a 737.

6951
03:21:11,630 --> 03:21:13,690
So I'm kind of scared.

6952
03:21:15,130 --> 03:21:15,570
Legitimately.

6953
03:21:19,590 --> 03:21:20,030
But...

6954
03:21:21,490 --> 03:21:23,910
I would say YOLO, but I'm already dead.

6955
03:21:27,390 --> 03:21:31,070
And I can't change it, which is the worst part about it.

6956
03:21:31,250 --> 03:21:32,390
Don't worry, you'll be safe.

6957
03:21:32,390 --> 03:21:32,710
Okay.

6958
03:21:36,670 --> 03:21:38,510
What's the worst that could happen?

6959
03:21:38,610 --> 03:21:39,830
I'll just make sure my...

6960
03:21:40,390 --> 03:21:40,970
Yoda...

6961
03:21:40,970 --> 03:21:43,350
You only die once.

6962
03:21:46,150 --> 03:21:47,070
Momo raid!

6963
03:21:48,090 --> 03:21:49,170
Thank you!

6964
03:21:49,970 --> 03:21:51,210
Hi, Motoro.

6965
03:21:52,050 --> 03:21:53,370
Hi, Momos.

6966
03:21:53,630 --> 03:21:54,710
Hello, hello.

6967
03:21:56,110 --> 03:21:57,210
Hello, hello.

6968
03:21:57,310 --> 03:21:58,070
Momo raid!

6969
03:21:58,170 --> 03:21:59,390
Manual raid!

6970
03:21:59,390 --> 03:22:00,190
Momo raid!

6971
03:22:01,230 --> 03:22:02,270
Momo raid!

6972
03:22:02,730 --> 03:22:05,590
What are you guys doing here?

6973
03:22:06,290 --> 03:22:06,810
What?

6974
03:22:07,170 --> 03:22:08,570
Oh my gosh.

6975
03:22:08,610 --> 03:22:10,110
Where did you all come from?

6976
03:22:10,570 --> 03:22:10,890
Matara!

6977
03:22:11,690 --> 03:22:13,330
Why are you gifting 50?

6978
03:22:14,510 --> 03:22:15,290
Stop that.

6979
03:22:17,770 --> 03:22:18,290
Matarakan.

6980
03:22:18,370 --> 03:22:19,550
I'm gonna tell your mother.

6981
03:22:22,470 --> 03:22:26,290
In case anyone is watching, Mint knows information is about to blow the whistle on it.

6982
03:22:26,350 --> 03:22:26,710
Get her!

6983
03:22:31,930 --> 03:22:32,450
What?

6984
03:22:32,550 --> 03:22:34,430
What if the door blows open though?

6985
03:22:34,870 --> 03:22:36,430
And I just float away.

6986
03:22:37,950 --> 03:22:38,990
I just float.

6987
03:22:40,190 --> 03:22:41,950
What if I land in Ohio?

6988
03:22:44,530 --> 03:22:45,550
Oh no.

6989
03:22:45,990 --> 03:22:46,510
Paperbacks.

6990
03:22:47,070 --> 03:22:47,930
Thanks for the 10 gift.

6991
03:22:47,970 --> 03:22:48,450
Thank you.

6992
03:22:49,130 --> 03:22:50,110
Thank you, thank you.

6993
03:22:50,890 --> 03:22:52,330
Morris, welcome to Mambooship.

6994
03:22:53,090 --> 03:22:55,490
I think you have 5 minute follow mode.

6995
03:22:55,730 --> 03:22:56,630
So my take of...

6996
03:22:56,630 --> 03:22:59,370
I think you have 5 minute follow mode.

6997
03:22:59,370 --> 03:23:00,030
It was so fun.

6998
03:23:00,110 --> 03:23:02,550
Matara, good luck with your tournament later this month.

6999
03:23:03,090 --> 03:23:11,090
It's probably good that you played this time because imagine not playing before the tournament and seeing how overwhelming and insane it is.

7000
03:23:13,610 --> 03:23:15,510
My message doesn't show on the screen.

7001
03:23:15,790 --> 03:23:17,010
I see you right there.

7002
03:23:17,790 --> 03:23:18,550
Rope wash!

7003
03:23:18,670 --> 03:23:19,470
Thanks for the 10 gift.

7004
03:23:19,530 --> 03:23:21,570
The game is crazy.

7005
03:23:23,090 --> 03:23:24,070
Just like...

7006
03:23:24,070 --> 03:23:27,010
Are you gonna be streaming it?

7007
03:23:27,010 --> 03:23:32,130
Because if you're not streaming, you can literally put yourself into a trance and not even talk.

7008
03:23:32,850 --> 03:23:34,130
You can just...

7009
03:23:35,090 --> 03:23:37,190
You can just...

7010
03:23:43,090 --> 03:23:43,630
Like

7011
03:23:47,690 --> 03:23:48,230
this.

7012
03:23:50,570 --> 03:23:51,970
Also, do you like my...

7013
03:23:51,970 --> 03:23:56,730
Do you like my really calming music after all of this?

7014
03:23:58,210 --> 03:23:59,730
I'm just playing the bunny game again.

7015
03:24:02,010 --> 03:24:02,750
As expected.

7016
03:24:03,030 --> 03:24:06,850
I have to continue because I want to get to the parts where you play with the cameras too.

7017
03:24:07,470 --> 03:24:10,370
But did I even leave space in my schedule for next week?

7018
03:24:10,690 --> 03:24:11,470
Let me see.

7019
03:24:13,010 --> 03:24:15,250
I have another collab next week actually.

7020
03:24:16,530 --> 03:24:18,050
I'm not gonna say you...

7021
03:24:18,050 --> 03:24:18,830
Oh wait, I do.

7022
03:24:18,950 --> 03:24:20,390
I do have a room.

7023
03:24:20,830 --> 03:24:22,390
Okay, bunny garden.

7024
03:24:24,770 --> 03:24:25,730
I can do it.

7025
03:24:27,090 --> 03:24:27,530
Hmm...

7026
03:24:30,030 --> 03:24:30,470
Uh...

7027
03:24:31,930 --> 03:24:32,330
Um...

7028
03:24:33,470 --> 03:24:34,830
Matara already said who it's with?

7029
03:24:36,250 --> 03:24:36,650
Huh?

7030
03:24:37,290 --> 03:24:38,730
How did... I don't think I told her.

7031
03:24:45,080 --> 03:24:46,540
No, that's not next week.

7032
03:24:50,320 --> 03:24:52,020
They're thinking of Deep Rock Galactic.

7033
03:24:52,080 --> 03:24:54,560
Oh yeah, Deep Rock Galactic is not next week.

7034
03:24:54,760 --> 03:24:54,980
No, no.

7035
03:24:57,520 --> 03:24:58,320
Hippie Kuma!

7036
03:24:58,400 --> 03:24:59,180
Thanks for the vibe.

7037
03:24:59,240 --> 03:25:00,020
Thank you!

7038
03:25:00,440 --> 03:25:01,160
Thank you, thank you.

7039
03:25:02,040 --> 03:25:02,920
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

7040
03:25:02,920 --> 03:25:03,000
Thank you.

7041
03:25:04,640 --> 03:25:05,940
But that's eventually.

7042
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:08,160
That's eventually.

7043
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:09,720
Um...

7044
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:10,660
Yeah.

7045
03:25:12,280 --> 03:25:15,000
I know that Matara and I have been collabing a lot.

7046
03:25:15,140 --> 03:25:16,100
And we also have the podcast.

7047
03:25:16,580 --> 03:25:18,380
It's because I'm like...

7048
03:25:18,700 --> 03:25:19,860
nervous to talk to people.

7049
03:25:20,280 --> 03:25:20,880
So...

7050
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:25,080
She kind of helps facilitate some things sometimes.

7051
03:25:27,260 --> 03:25:28,960
Proud of how much you've been networking.

7052
03:25:29,300 --> 03:25:30,120
I've been trying!

7053
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:31,580
I've been trying for real.

7054
03:25:32,220 --> 03:25:32,820
So...

7055
03:25:32,820 --> 03:25:34,040
You know.

7056
03:25:38,620 --> 03:25:40,880
I'm trying to talk to people.

7057
03:25:44,580 --> 03:25:46,180
Borrowing that extrovert energy.

7058
03:25:48,040 --> 03:25:48,640
Yeah.

7059
03:25:49,780 --> 03:25:50,980
Prince Wendrew!

7060
03:25:51,300 --> 03:25:52,240
Thanks for the vibe!

7061
03:25:52,480 --> 03:25:53,060
Gifted!

7062
03:25:53,060 --> 03:25:53,760
Thank you!

7063
03:25:54,280 --> 03:25:55,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

7064
03:25:56,840 --> 03:25:58,520
Gotta get to the 500k.

7065
03:26:00,120 --> 03:26:00,360
First!

7066
03:26:00,780 --> 03:26:01,720
I don't even...

7067
03:26:02,620 --> 03:26:04,680
What am I even at?

7068
03:26:04,880 --> 03:26:05,380
I don't even know.

7069
03:26:06,580 --> 03:26:07,000
98!

7070
03:26:10,020 --> 03:26:10,440
98.

7071
03:26:13,480 --> 03:26:13,900
Crazy.

7072
03:26:14,660 --> 03:26:16,160
Did I make it in time for the stream?

7073
03:26:17,180 --> 03:26:18,380
I mean it's kind of over.

7074
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:19,320
But not like...

7075
03:26:19,320 --> 03:26:21,220
The gameplay is over, you know.

7076
03:26:23,420 --> 03:26:25,160
The gameplay is over, you know.

7077
03:26:26,020 --> 03:26:26,580
Mm-mm.

7078
03:26:27,420 --> 03:26:28,060
Mm-mm.

7079
03:26:30,120 --> 03:26:31,580
You might get them this weekend.

7080
03:26:31,700 --> 03:26:32,220
Who knows?

7081
03:26:33,380 --> 03:26:34,940
Thank you for the 50!

7082
03:26:36,060 --> 03:26:36,980
Thank you!

7083
03:26:38,520 --> 03:26:39,460
Thank you, thank you.

7084
03:26:39,700 --> 03:26:41,660
Oh, I'm not worrying about it at all.

7085
03:26:41,840 --> 03:26:43,540
Don't get me wrong.

7086
03:26:43,640 --> 03:26:46,120
I'm not just like, why am I not at 200k?

7087
03:26:46,640 --> 03:26:47,800
No, I'm just...

7088
03:26:47,800 --> 03:26:49,780
I think it's cool that...

7089
03:26:50,600 --> 03:26:51,540
When I...

7090
03:26:52,040 --> 03:26:53,960
When I left, I was at 10k.

7091
03:26:54,120 --> 03:26:56,080
And now I'm almost at 200k.

7092
03:26:56,140 --> 03:26:58,280
I think that's a huge accomplishment.

7093
03:26:58,760 --> 03:26:59,240
So...

7094
03:27:00,120 --> 03:27:01,340
I'm not worried about it at all.

7095
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:01,940
To be honest.

7096
03:27:04,900 --> 03:27:06,120
Yeah, I'm just vibing.

7097
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:07,520
I'm having a good time.

7098
03:27:09,280 --> 03:27:10,600
I'm having a good time.

7099
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:12,440
Yeah.

7100
03:27:15,280 --> 03:27:16,740
Hashtag carried by Matara.

7101
03:27:17,640 --> 03:27:18,520
Slash sarcasm.

7102
03:27:18,860 --> 03:27:20,840
You have to put the sarcasm in there.

7103
03:27:22,220 --> 03:27:22,660
Robo!

7104
03:27:22,960 --> 03:27:24,320
Thank you for the 50 gift!

7105
03:27:24,340 --> 03:27:24,980
Thank you!

7106
03:27:25,840 --> 03:27:27,240
Thank you for the 10 gift!

7107
03:27:27,320 --> 03:27:27,960
Thank you so much.

7108
03:27:30,120 --> 03:27:30,660
I'm having a good time.

7109
03:27:30,800 --> 03:27:32,580
I'm not gonna have a good time next week though.

7110
03:27:33,060 --> 03:27:33,500
Because...

7111
03:27:33,500 --> 03:27:36,160
I might do an Atlantis no nazo in turn.

7112
03:27:41,200 --> 03:27:44,060
So I might have a really bad time next week actually.

7113
03:27:50,490 --> 03:27:51,710
Why do I do this?

7114
03:27:51,770 --> 03:27:52,410
An accomplishment?

7115
03:27:56,470 --> 03:27:57,630
What's so bad about it?

7116
03:27:57,770 --> 03:27:58,610
It's like...

7117
03:27:58,610 --> 03:28:00,010
It's like...

7118
03:28:00,610 --> 03:28:02,070
Peak kusoge.

7119
03:28:02,250 --> 03:28:03,810
The game is just...

7120
03:28:03,810 --> 03:28:07,510
It's notoriously difficult and obtuse.

7121
03:28:07,850 --> 03:28:08,630
And...

7122
03:28:08,630 --> 03:28:10,210
Love the piano in the back.

7123
03:28:10,370 --> 03:28:12,910
Yeah, we're calming down after...

7124
03:28:12,910 --> 03:28:14,250
A very...

7125
03:28:15,290 --> 03:28:16,070
Stressful...

7126
03:28:16,340 --> 03:28:17,650
And crazy...

7127
03:28:17,650 --> 03:28:19,570
Game of left 4 dead.

7128
03:28:19,950 --> 03:28:20,510
Yes.

7129
03:28:20,550 --> 03:28:21,850
Trash NES game.

7130
03:28:21,990 --> 03:28:22,390
Exactly!

7131
03:28:22,390 --> 03:28:24,370
It is a trash NES game.

7132
03:28:24,430 --> 03:28:24,910
For real.

7133
03:28:25,750 --> 03:28:26,790
Which game?

7134
03:28:26,890 --> 03:28:28,430
Atlantis no nazo.

7135
03:28:29,130 --> 03:28:29,850
Mhm.

7136
03:28:31,290 --> 03:28:32,910
I must try it.

7137
03:28:33,910 --> 03:28:35,290
I must play it.

7138
03:28:35,450 --> 03:28:37,450
I've been wanting to for so long.

7139
03:28:38,170 --> 03:28:39,330
Yeah, we're calm.

7140
03:28:39,550 --> 03:28:40,570
We're calm.

7141
03:28:40,810 --> 03:28:43,050
If you hear my voice...

7142
03:28:43,590 --> 03:28:46,550
You are going into a trance.

7143
03:28:46,750 --> 03:28:49,530
And you will...

7144
03:28:49,530 --> 03:28:54,670
And you will...

7145
03:28:55,890 --> 03:28:58,970
I love it because it's the first game Arino challenged in Game Center CX.

7146
03:28:59,030 --> 03:29:00,730
That's kind of why I want to play it.

7147
03:29:00,850 --> 03:29:01,730
I saw...

7148
03:29:02,790 --> 03:29:03,930
Him play it.

7149
03:29:04,210 --> 03:29:04,470
And...

7150
03:29:07,570 --> 03:29:08,610
Korone play it.

7151
03:29:10,510 --> 03:29:12,910
And I admire Korone's...

7152
03:29:12,910 --> 03:29:13,930
Endurance and...

7153
03:29:14,490 --> 03:29:15,550
Skills as a gamer.

7154
03:29:16,270 --> 03:29:18,610
It's not that I'm like...

7155
03:29:18,610 --> 03:29:20,510
How do I say this?

7156
03:29:21,590 --> 03:29:22,250
It's like...

7157
03:29:22,250 --> 03:29:23,370
I don't want to copy her.

7158
03:29:24,670 --> 03:29:25,170
I'm like...

7159
03:29:25,170 --> 03:29:27,250
She did this challenging game.

7160
03:29:27,410 --> 03:29:28,270
I want to do it too.

7161
03:29:29,830 --> 03:29:31,410
So I'm like...

7162
03:29:32,710 --> 03:29:33,790
I will try.

7163
03:29:35,230 --> 03:29:35,750
Yeah.

7164
03:29:37,490 --> 03:29:38,010
Yeah.

7165
03:29:38,010 --> 03:29:38,690
I'm inspired.

7166
03:29:39,310 --> 03:29:40,570
I admire her.

7167
03:29:41,410 --> 03:29:41,930
Inspired.

7168
03:29:43,470 --> 03:29:45,150
Matara told us to give you money.

7169
03:29:45,270 --> 03:29:45,850
So we obey.

7170
03:29:46,150 --> 03:29:48,530
Why would you listen to anything she ever says ever?

7171
03:29:49,670 --> 03:29:50,730
Finally caught you live.

7172
03:29:51,190 --> 03:29:54,050
Are you planning on replaying any of the MGS games?

7173
03:29:54,670 --> 03:29:55,870
Morky, I'm glad you asked.

7174
03:29:56,150 --> 03:29:58,490
I plan on replaying all of them.

7175
03:29:58,950 --> 03:29:59,370
Yeah!

7176
03:30:01,730 --> 03:30:02,210
Well...

7177
03:30:02,210 --> 03:30:04,350
I'm still deciding on MGS5.

7178
03:30:04,670 --> 03:30:05,750
But also...

7179
03:30:05,750 --> 03:30:06,330
Oh, wait.

7180
03:30:06,410 --> 03:30:07,030
I almost said something.

7181
03:30:09,030 --> 03:30:10,350
Snappy, thanks for the $10 gift.

7182
03:30:14,910 --> 03:30:15,730
Like the...

7183
03:30:15,730 --> 03:30:16,370
When I...

7184
03:30:17,530 --> 03:30:19,570
Like the last time I played 5...

7185
03:30:19,570 --> 03:30:21,650
I was on the fence about playing it before 2.

7186
03:30:21,650 --> 03:30:24,470
But I ended up playing it because I was just craving.

7187
03:30:24,790 --> 03:30:25,310
I was...

7188
03:30:25,310 --> 03:30:26,090
I was...

7189
03:30:26,090 --> 03:30:28,310
I was starving for the...

7190
03:30:28,310 --> 03:30:30,630
For the more Metal Gear content.

7191
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:31,850
So...

7192
03:30:31,850 --> 03:30:33,270
Mmm...

7193
03:30:35,610 --> 03:30:36,350
So...

7194
03:30:36,350 --> 03:30:39,530
I've based my personality on V.

7195
03:30:40,790 --> 03:30:41,530
Anthony...

7196
03:30:41,530 --> 03:30:42,210
Anthony!

7197
03:30:42,330 --> 03:30:45,750
You've based your personality on a silent protagonist!

7198
03:30:50,790 --> 03:30:51,530
Um...

7199
03:30:51,530 --> 03:30:52,330
But I think...

7200
03:30:52,330 --> 03:30:54,150
I think if I play V again...

7201
03:30:54,170 --> 03:30:55,050
Maybe um...

7202
03:30:55,050 --> 03:30:58,250
I might do something similar to how like with...

7203
03:30:58,250 --> 03:30:59,590
April 30th...

7204
03:30:59,590 --> 03:31:01,490
I only did the skateboarding game.

7205
03:31:01,630 --> 03:31:04,290
Like maybe I'll do certain missions or something.

7206
03:31:04,370 --> 03:31:05,150
Like I'll...

7207
03:31:05,850 --> 03:31:07,950
Made headband for one year win.

7208
03:31:09,190 --> 03:31:09,710
Um...

7209
03:31:10,510 --> 03:31:11,690
Didn't I have that?

7210
03:31:13,270 --> 03:31:13,790
Uh...

7211
03:31:13,790 --> 03:31:14,210
But it...

7212
03:31:14,210 --> 03:31:16,750
But YouTube erased it.

7213
03:31:16,910 --> 03:31:18,270
I have to re-upload it.

7214
03:31:18,350 --> 03:31:19,370
Holy cow!

7215
03:31:19,670 --> 03:31:20,230
Oh my gosh.

7216
03:31:20,250 --> 03:31:20,470
Sorry.

7217
03:31:20,550 --> 03:31:21,870
I just opened up YouTube.

7218
03:31:22,050 --> 03:31:23,070
To go check that.

7219
03:31:24,170 --> 03:31:26,010
This amazing digital circus is at...

7220
03:31:26,010 --> 03:31:28,030
9 million views!

7221
03:31:28,250 --> 03:31:29,570
In 5 hours!

7222
03:31:30,710 --> 03:31:31,830
Holy cow!

7223
03:31:32,790 --> 03:31:33,350
What?

7224
03:31:35,570 --> 03:31:36,550
Oh my gosh.

7225
03:31:36,570 --> 03:31:37,710
The kitties went crazy.

7226
03:31:38,150 --> 03:31:39,610
In 5 hours.

7227
03:31:39,630 --> 03:31:40,670
9 million views.

7228
03:31:40,950 --> 03:31:42,130
What is like the...

7229
03:31:42,130 --> 03:31:44,270
I wonder what like the record is.

7230
03:31:44,370 --> 03:31:46,430
For like most views in a certain amount of time.

7231
03:31:48,210 --> 03:31:49,390
The episode is good.

7232
03:31:50,070 --> 03:31:52,290
Um... I got to the part where like they...

7233
03:31:52,290 --> 03:31:53,810
Were riding up on the gators.

7234
03:31:54,170 --> 03:31:55,390
And then I went and took a shower.

7235
03:31:58,410 --> 03:32:00,130
Yeah there's an episode 2 out.

7236
03:32:00,390 --> 03:32:01,070
There's episode 2.

7237
03:32:01,150 --> 03:32:01,850
So if you want more...

7238
03:32:01,850 --> 03:32:02,590
Pomney action.

7239
03:32:03,190 --> 03:32:03,930
Yeah dude.

7240
03:32:04,170 --> 03:32:06,050
Us 6 monthers are chomping at the bit.

7241
03:32:06,210 --> 03:32:07,770
Oh you have 6 months!

7242
03:32:08,670 --> 03:32:09,630
Calm down.

7243
03:32:10,830 --> 03:32:11,650
No um...

7244
03:32:11,650 --> 03:32:13,530
I tried re-uploading the headband before.

7245
03:32:13,670 --> 03:32:16,150
And it said that it was not 1 to 1.

7246
03:32:16,390 --> 03:32:17,970
So I have to just...

7247
03:32:17,970 --> 03:32:19,150
I just have to... what's the word?

7248
03:32:20,330 --> 03:32:20,810
Um...

7249
03:32:22,410 --> 03:32:23,070
Resize it.

7250
03:32:26,210 --> 03:32:26,850
Yeah it says.

7251
03:32:26,850 --> 03:32:27,050
I'm trying to get...

7252
03:32:27,050 --> 03:32:28,870
100 million views.

7253
03:32:32,170 --> 03:32:33,450
Yeah obviously.

7254
03:32:34,670 --> 03:32:35,650
100 million.

7255
03:32:36,810 --> 03:32:39,950
I haven't opened a cookie clicker in a long time!

7256
03:32:40,250 --> 03:32:40,410
I haven't opened a cookie clicker in a long time!

7257
03:32:40,410 --> 03:32:40,910
Oh my gosh.

7258
03:32:41,010 --> 03:32:41,410
Wait...

7259
03:32:43,330 --> 03:32:43,970
Oh...

7260
03:32:45,310 --> 03:32:45,950
Cookie...

7261
03:32:47,350 --> 03:32:48,630
Cookie clicker.

7262
03:32:49,870 --> 03:32:50,190
Play.

7263
03:32:51,590 --> 03:32:52,930
Let's see how my cookies are doing.

7264
03:32:53,230 --> 03:32:56,530
Happy May the 4th and Revenge of the 5th from Australia!

7265
03:32:58,530 --> 03:33:04,230
Is there any clone trooper class type squad or legion that you like as your favorite, both from Legends and Canon?

7266
03:33:07,990 --> 03:33:12,170
Oh my gosh, I've harvested 26 sugar lumps while I was away.

7267
03:33:17,190 --> 03:33:20,710
I've watched one Star War.

7268
03:33:21,230 --> 03:33:21,910
Yay!

7269
03:33:22,290 --> 03:33:23,550
Thank you for the reward!

7270
03:33:25,880 --> 03:33:26,560
Thank you!

7271
03:33:27,720 --> 03:33:29,440
Thank you so much!

7272
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:30,340
Thank you!

7273
03:33:30,800 --> 03:33:36,280
But I really like the Stormtrooper designs.

7274
03:33:36,900 --> 03:33:41,440
A long time ago, I tried to get one printed for myself.

7275
03:33:42,040 --> 03:33:43,580
I'm such a fake fan.

7276
03:33:44,020 --> 03:33:46,480
I did never even see... I'm such a poser.

7277
03:33:46,640 --> 03:33:50,960
I was gonna dress up as a Stormtrooper and I wasn't even going to...

7278
03:33:50,960 --> 03:33:53,300
I've never watched Star Wars.

7279
03:33:57,520 --> 03:34:02,300
See, every time I think about Star Wars, I just wanna watch Indiana Jones again, you know?

7280
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:09,400
Every time... every time I...

7281
03:34:09,980 --> 03:34:11,840
Aren't you a little short to be a Stormtrooper?

7282
03:34:12,280 --> 03:34:13,560
What are you talking about?

7283
03:34:14,020 --> 03:34:15,460
There's no... there's no height requirement.

7284
03:34:19,660 --> 03:34:21,660
Members, watch along of Star Wars, please.

7285
03:34:26,420 --> 03:34:28,940
We can only... we can watch just the first three, right?

7286
03:34:31,420 --> 03:34:32,420
That was a quote.

7287
03:34:32,740 --> 03:34:34,060
That was a line from the movie.

7288
03:34:36,660 --> 03:34:37,100
Wait.

7289
03:34:37,100 --> 03:34:37,840
I'm gonna guess.

7290
03:34:38,060 --> 03:34:39,560
Does Han Solo say that?

7291
03:34:42,180 --> 03:34:42,980
That's my guess.

7292
03:34:43,160 --> 03:34:45,080
Is he... did he... did he say that?

7293
03:34:46,160 --> 03:34:46,580
Oh, no.

7294
03:34:52,930 --> 03:34:54,470
Go with Captain Houser.

7295
03:34:54,510 --> 03:34:56,010
He's pretty close to your color.

7296
03:34:57,930 --> 03:34:59,630
It's funny because I...

7297
03:35:01,490 --> 03:35:03,210
He was whispering the Samuel L.

7298
03:35:03,230 --> 03:35:04,230
Jackson storytime video.

7299
03:35:04,290 --> 03:35:05,290
Did I use this in that video?

7300
03:35:05,690 --> 03:35:10,190
I do remember that video though, but I don't remember if I did music in it.

7301
03:35:11,490 --> 03:35:12,650
Oh, and welcome to membership.

7302
03:35:14,310 --> 03:35:14,770
Um...

7303
03:35:15,730 --> 03:35:19,510
No, I meant the first three like the original first three.

7304
03:35:19,570 --> 03:35:21,850
But I do kind of want to watch the prequels too.

7305
03:35:23,950 --> 03:35:26,830
I do kind of want to watch the prequels also because I...

7306
03:35:26,830 --> 03:35:27,550
I don't know.

7307
03:35:27,730 --> 03:35:28,350
I want to laugh.

7308
03:35:28,670 --> 03:35:30,190
But I've seen... it's so bad.

7309
03:35:30,290 --> 03:35:32,090
I've seen Plinkett's reviews on...

7310
03:35:32,090 --> 03:35:33,310
from Red Letter Media.

7311
03:35:33,450 --> 03:35:35,510
I've seen his reviews about Star Wars, but...

7312
03:35:36,290 --> 03:35:38,370
I never watched anything myself.

7313
03:35:38,850 --> 03:35:38,890
Oh!

7314
03:35:41,110 --> 03:35:45,850
Doki Bird, FPS, Vtuber, Facebook, TTV, YouTube!

7315
03:35:46,170 --> 03:35:47,150
Thanks for the five gifted.

7316
03:35:47,190 --> 03:35:47,710
Thank you!

7317
03:35:50,750 --> 03:35:51,830
Thank you!

7318
03:35:52,270 --> 03:35:56,250
In fact, Shepardton Designs, the studio that made the original Stormtrooper suit...

7319
03:35:56,250 --> 03:35:58,870
is selling the full suit with the helmet and the blaster.

7320
03:35:59,170 --> 03:36:00,370
How much is expensive?

7321
03:36:00,790 --> 03:36:01,410
I'm curious.

7322
03:36:03,950 --> 03:36:05,190
How much is the...

7323
03:36:06,250 --> 03:36:08,650
I clapped when I saw it.

7324
03:36:10,770 --> 03:36:13,070
I've never watched them, but I'm watching in chronological order.

7325
03:36:13,630 --> 03:36:16,630
Is it one of those... is it a series that you should...

7326
03:36:16,630 --> 03:36:17,430
Like, okay, wait.

7327
03:36:17,570 --> 03:36:18,770
So it's the prequels?

7328
03:36:19,510 --> 03:36:22,210
And then, like, the original three movies that were made?

7329
03:36:24,570 --> 03:36:25,370
And then...

7330
03:36:27,390 --> 03:36:28,190
And then...

7331
03:36:29,490 --> 03:36:31,550
What was the recent ones that were made?

7332
03:36:34,750 --> 03:36:38,050
Wait, four, five, six, one, two, three, seven, eight, nine.

7333
03:36:38,890 --> 03:36:39,450
Seven, eight, nine.

7334
03:36:40,050 --> 03:36:41,350
I thought there were just two.

7335
03:36:43,030 --> 03:36:43,990
The sequels.

7336
03:36:43,990 --> 03:36:45,050
Wait, they're just called...

7337
03:36:45,050 --> 03:36:47,850
So it's the prequels, the originals, and the sequels?

7338
03:36:56,460 --> 03:36:57,500
It's only six.

7339
03:37:05,360 --> 03:37:07,340
And then I have to watch...

7340
03:37:08,860 --> 03:37:09,820
The Mandalorian.

7341
03:37:10,520 --> 03:37:12,380
When does the Clone Wars happen?

7342
03:37:13,780 --> 03:37:15,020
When did I watch that?

7343
03:37:17,480 --> 03:37:19,700
I can't believe I'm surrounded by a bunch of fakes.

7344
03:37:21,620 --> 03:37:22,580
I'm sorry.

7345
03:37:23,840 --> 03:37:25,220
Clone Trooper armor looks cool.

7346
03:37:25,300 --> 03:37:26,520
IMO, especially Captain Rex.

7347
03:37:26,640 --> 03:37:27,040
I'm like, hold on.

7348
03:37:28,180 --> 03:37:29,140
Captain... Rex.

7349
03:37:32,520 --> 03:37:34,340
Oh, I do like that.

7350
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:36,260
I do like that.

7351
03:37:36,400 --> 03:37:38,720
Wait, you said the... the Clone Troopers?

7352
03:37:38,980 --> 03:37:43,600
I don't know.

7353
03:37:43,820 --> 03:37:45,820
They just don't look as...

7354
03:37:45,820 --> 03:37:47,180
I mean, they look cool.

7355
03:37:47,300 --> 03:37:47,880
Don't get me wrong.

7356
03:37:48,700 --> 03:37:50,740
But I think Stormtroopers are cuter.

7357
03:37:54,300 --> 03:37:56,080
Yeah, I like the Stormtrooper.

7358
03:37:56,380 --> 03:37:58,940
I like how his mouth is like a little triangle down.

7359
03:37:59,580 --> 03:38:00,500
It's so cute.

7360
03:38:00,600 --> 03:38:02,260
Oh wait, it's like that on the Clone Trooper.

7361
03:38:03,360 --> 03:38:05,260
But I also like that his head is bigger.

7362
03:38:05,540 --> 03:38:06,460
It's really wide.

7363
03:38:06,840 --> 03:38:08,200
He's got like a massive chin.

7364
03:38:10,840 --> 03:38:12,500
The helmet or the armor in general?

7365
03:38:13,700 --> 03:38:14,980
I really like the helmet.

7366
03:38:14,980 --> 03:38:15,160
The helmet.

7367
03:38:16,960 --> 03:38:18,360
Clone Troopers have collars?

7368
03:38:19,440 --> 03:38:20,240
Clone Trooper.

7369
03:38:22,900 --> 03:38:23,300
Trooper.

7370
03:38:27,180 --> 03:38:30,720
The Clone Trooper armor looks almost the same as the Stormtrooper armor.

7371
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:31,920
I should have them side by side.

7372
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:33,400
Stormtrooper.

7373
03:38:35,600 --> 03:38:37,060
You know about the Ewoks?

7374
03:38:37,200 --> 03:38:38,480
Are those the ones that go...

7375
03:38:42,060 --> 03:38:43,500
Hold on, hold on, I got this.

7376
03:38:58,060 --> 03:38:59,100
Hold on, hold on.

7377
03:39:00,260 --> 03:39:01,760
Oh, that was pretty good, that was...

7378
03:39:15,150 --> 03:39:16,330
That's a Wookiee.

7379
03:39:18,170 --> 03:39:18,570
Wookiee.

7380
03:39:19,450 --> 03:39:20,250
Wait, so what...

7381
03:39:21,790 --> 03:39:22,190
Ewok.

7382
03:39:27,130 --> 03:39:27,530
Oh!

7383
03:39:27,750 --> 03:39:30,030
Oh my god, they look like my old dog.

7384
03:39:31,250 --> 03:39:31,650
What?

7385
03:39:32,650 --> 03:39:35,650
I don't know if I like that, because I didn't like that dog.

7386
03:39:37,370 --> 03:39:38,870
It was really my mom's dog.

7387
03:39:41,190 --> 03:39:49,550
Star Wars only becomes watchable as an adult when you realize that the Jedi are crocked cops and Luke Skywalker was an android slave.

7388
03:39:49,690 --> 03:39:50,730
What is going on?

7389
03:39:53,570 --> 03:39:54,550
Jawas are cute?

7390
03:39:55,730 --> 03:39:56,290
Jawas.

7391
03:39:57,390 --> 03:39:57,950
Oh!

7392
03:39:58,630 --> 03:40:00,990
Oh my gosh, they look just like...

7393
03:40:00,990 --> 03:40:02,530
They just look like...

7394
03:40:03,010 --> 03:40:04,050
The Stab Guys!

7395
03:40:04,890 --> 03:40:07,410
The Tom... Tom...

7396
03:40:09,750 --> 03:40:10,270
Tom...

7397
03:40:10,270 --> 03:40:10,370
Tomberry?

7398
03:40:12,950 --> 03:40:13,470
Tonberry!

7399
03:40:14,230 --> 03:40:15,910
They look just like a Tonberry!

7400
03:40:19,390 --> 03:40:21,410
They look so cute, the Jawas.

7401
03:40:21,530 --> 03:40:25,390
Oh my gosh, even the plushies of them are so cute!

7402
03:40:27,110 --> 03:40:28,510
Oh, they're so, so cute.

7403
03:40:30,890 --> 03:40:32,490
Tonberries from Final Fantasy.

7404
03:40:38,470 --> 03:40:39,590
I like them.

7405
03:40:40,150 --> 03:40:42,290
Wait, what did you say about...

7406
03:40:42,290 --> 03:40:43,610
They make a funny noise too?

7407
03:40:43,910 --> 03:40:44,790
The Jawas?

7408
03:40:45,090 --> 03:40:46,510
What do they sound like?

7409
03:40:49,550 --> 03:40:50,950
Jabba the Hutt is really...

7410
03:40:50,950 --> 03:40:51,730
I know that guy.

7411
03:40:52,590 --> 03:40:53,770
I know that guy.

7412
03:40:53,870 --> 03:40:57,290
He's the one that enslaves Leia.

7413
03:41:00,790 --> 03:41:01,350
Ootini!

7414
03:41:03,170 --> 03:41:03,450
Ootini!

7415
03:41:05,130 --> 03:41:06,170
Please look...

7416
03:41:06,170 --> 03:41:07,350
I know Jabba the Hutt.

7417
03:41:10,170 --> 03:41:13,010
I always thought that this guy was...

7418
03:41:15,070 --> 03:41:16,670
Was Emperor...

7419
03:41:16,670 --> 03:41:17,010
Emperor...

7420
03:41:17,010 --> 03:41:19,310
Hold on.

7421
03:41:20,030 --> 03:41:22,630
Emperor Palpatine.

7422
03:41:26,110 --> 03:41:31,710
I thought it was Emperor...

7423
03:41:31,710 --> 03:41:33,670
Emperor Palpatine.

7424
03:41:36,690 --> 03:41:38,070
Stop making fun of me.

7425
03:41:43,410 --> 03:41:43,930
Emperor...

7426
03:41:44,870 --> 03:41:45,390
Emperor...

7427
03:41:46,750 --> 03:41:47,270
Palpatine.

7428
03:41:48,690 --> 03:41:50,770
They look kind of similar, I think.

7429
03:41:51,410 --> 03:41:52,510
Just kind of...

7430
03:41:52,510 --> 03:41:54,130
They're both really wrinkly.

7431
03:41:54,270 --> 03:41:55,450
I think that's why it was.

7432
03:41:56,130 --> 03:41:56,650
Emperor...

7433
03:41:56,650 --> 03:41:58,810
Stop making fun of me!

7434
03:42:05,950 --> 03:42:07,070
That's an old man.

7435
03:42:08,870 --> 03:42:10,490
One's an old man and one's a slug.

7436
03:42:10,690 --> 03:42:11,790
Close enough.

7437
03:42:15,070 --> 03:42:17,070
And he talks like this.

7438
03:42:17,530 --> 03:42:19,230
I'm Emperor Palpatine.

7439
03:42:19,230 --> 03:42:20,130
I said it again.

7440
03:42:20,530 --> 03:42:21,290
Stop.

7441
03:42:21,690 --> 03:42:23,070
What's wrong with me?

7442
03:42:23,650 --> 03:42:25,110
Marrowed, welcome to membership.

7443
03:42:25,530 --> 03:42:27,550
I'm Emperor Palpatine.

7444
03:42:30,390 --> 03:42:31,550
He says...

7445
03:42:31,550 --> 03:42:32,470
Do it.

7446
03:42:35,030 --> 03:42:36,230
Do it.

7447
03:42:39,690 --> 03:42:41,170
It's like he's really here.

7448
03:42:41,610 --> 03:42:42,650
Do it.

7449
03:42:44,710 --> 03:42:45,630
Do it.

7450
03:42:48,590 --> 03:42:50,790
Palpatine is wife material, to be honest.

7451
03:42:50,910 --> 03:42:51,410
Really?

7452
03:42:55,750 --> 03:42:57,630
Is it like a gap moe?

7453
03:42:58,090 --> 03:42:58,190
Is it like a gap moe?

7454
03:42:58,610 --> 03:43:00,470
Are you okay?

7455
03:43:00,710 --> 03:43:03,370
No, I think Left 4 Dead really took a lot out of me.

7456
03:43:04,270 --> 03:43:07,970
I think Left 4 Dead really took a chunk out of my brain.

7457
03:43:15,480 --> 03:43:16,140
It's okay.

7458
03:43:16,140 --> 03:43:16,300
Hold on.

7459
03:43:29,800 --> 03:43:31,560
I'm finding a good emote.

7460
03:43:31,660 --> 03:43:31,980
There we go.

7461
03:43:34,760 --> 03:43:35,420
Cute.

7462
03:43:37,980 --> 03:43:38,940
I'm embarrassed.

7463
03:43:39,560 --> 03:43:40,220
Okay.

7464
03:43:40,320 --> 03:43:41,060
I'm embarrassed.

7465
03:43:41,520 --> 03:43:44,180
I'm embarrassed that I can't speak properly.

7466
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:46,580
I need to go to enunciation classes.

7467
03:43:46,800 --> 03:43:50,420
Actually, I've been thinking recently how much I want to take...

7468
03:43:51,100 --> 03:43:52,100
Improv classes.

7469
03:43:53,940 --> 03:43:55,120
I've been thinking...

7470
03:43:55,900 --> 03:43:56,380
I've been thinking...

7471
03:43:56,380 --> 03:43:57,720
Xeonia, look at the membership!

7472
03:43:57,840 --> 03:43:58,220
Thank you!

7473
03:43:58,600 --> 03:44:06,840
I've been thinking about how I want to do- I did improv classes as a kid because I took a lot of- I did like acting classes, I did dance..

7474
03:44:06,840 --> 03:44:08,940
I went to a school of the arts basically.

7475
03:44:09,300 --> 03:44:10,980
And so I um..

7476
03:44:11,620 --> 03:44:13,300
I was there for like...

7477
03:44:13,940 --> 03:44:14,420
years.

7478
03:44:16,400 --> 03:44:16,880
Um...

7479
03:44:16,880 --> 03:44:25,160
But I wanna get back into improv For like, you know, sometimes I like This is the first time I've ever watched a video on TikTok, and I'm like, how are they so quick?

7480
03:44:25,280 --> 03:44:44,380
How are they so witty, you know, it's like, oh my gosh, I really want to, and I like, try to consume a bunch of different kinds of media and like, you know, I know TikTok gets hated on a bunch, but like, honestly, because of how short form TikTok is, and how much I'm consuming,

7481
03:44:44,580 --> 03:45:00,500
like, I'm watching, I'm watching skits, I'm watching facts, I'm watching dumb stuff, like I'm able to to, like, absorb so many different topics within such a short amount of time, that it actually, like, I feel like it helps me.

7482
03:45:01,460 --> 03:45:03,020
Dropout TV is the who-whos line.

7483
03:45:03,140 --> 03:45:20,380
I've been watching so much Dropout, oh my gosh, Game Changer is like the funniest show, it's so good, like, they, man, they saved college humor, like, dang, Game Changer is so, if you haven't watched it before, it's so funny.

7484
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:30,500
It's really, really good, um, but I've been here the whole time.

7485
03:45:31,820 --> 03:45:47,720
It used to be college humor, and then they, um, they changed it, but I watch, I watch, I only watch Game Changer and, um, actually, I only watch those two, Brendan is my wife, they're, they're really good.

7486
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:50,520
Um.

7487
03:45:51,480 --> 03:45:55,300
Conan O'Brien recently released a podcast video with Dr. Arroyo.

7488
03:45:55,480 --> 03:45:56,980
It's like a whole improv video.

7489
03:45:57,940 --> 03:45:59,040
A podcast one?

7490
03:46:00,380 --> 03:46:01,360
I will watch it.

7491
03:46:01,640 --> 03:46:04,180
Conan O'Brien is also just a comedic genius.

7492
03:46:04,960 --> 03:46:12,200
There, I, I, there's so many comedic, so many people that are just so witty, I'm like, man, I need to, I want to study.

7493
03:46:12,660 --> 03:46:20,760
But you, it's also like, it's also just like, at the same time, it's, it's, it's, what's the word?

7494
03:46:21,980 --> 03:46:30,960
It's like, not overthinking stuff, you know, you have to just be able to, if you overthink it, then you can't pull it out of your, out of your brain so fast.

7495
03:46:31,720 --> 03:46:35,520
Sorry if this is talked about before, but I'm curious if you've ever played the early Kojima game, Snatcher.

7496
03:46:36,260 --> 03:46:37,640
If not, you play as a police detective.

7497
03:46:37,800 --> 03:46:40,180
I know all about Snatcher, dude.

7498
03:46:40,760 --> 03:46:42,180
Two, two, zero, seven, two.

7499
03:46:42,240 --> 03:46:43,460
Thank you for the super chat, by the way.

7500
03:46:44,080 --> 03:46:46,880
Um, actually, I do intend on playing Snatcher.

7501
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:51,060
Um, I, uh, I own Policenauts.

7502
03:46:51,060 --> 03:46:58,080
I don't own Snatcher, but I would love to play Snatcher for sure.

7503
03:46:58,240 --> 03:47:04,720
But also I would have to get it in English, you know, I want to get it, get it like translated and stuff like that, but I really do want to play it.

7504
03:47:05,480 --> 03:47:06,260
Yes, yes, yes.

7505
03:47:07,740 --> 03:47:09,000
Conan's an actual genius too.

7506
03:47:09,040 --> 03:47:09,980
He graduated from Harvard.

7507
03:47:10,120 --> 03:47:10,380
Yeah.

7508
03:47:11,200 --> 03:47:12,220
You gotta be smart.

7509
03:47:12,440 --> 03:47:13,980
You gotta be quick on your feet.

7510
03:47:14,500 --> 03:47:14,900
Hmm.

7511
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:18,480
So, hmm.

7512
03:47:24,500 --> 03:47:25,600
Snatcher has an English release?

7513
03:47:25,740 --> 03:47:25,960
It does?

7514
03:47:26,800 --> 03:47:29,200
Wait, why was I looking for it in Japan every time?

7515
03:47:29,680 --> 03:47:30,720
Oh, the Sega...

7516
03:47:30,720 --> 03:47:31,760
Yes, the Sega CD.

7517
03:47:32,300 --> 03:47:33,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

7518
03:47:33,540 --> 03:47:33,800
I...

7519
03:47:33,800 --> 03:47:34,580
That's why...

7520
03:47:34,580 --> 03:47:35,400
Okay, I do remember.

7521
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:38,740
That's why I was struggling because that's why it's so expensive.

7522
03:47:39,440 --> 03:47:40,940
Thanks, Slow Beef.

7523
03:47:41,500 --> 03:47:42,240
That guy.

7524
03:47:42,620 --> 03:47:44,020
Internet dude, welcome to Bamboo Show.

7525
03:47:44,400 --> 03:47:45,540
Which version of Snatcher?

7526
03:47:45,660 --> 03:47:46,100
There's several.

7527
03:47:46,160 --> 03:47:47,780
They all have meaningful differences.

7528
03:47:48,220 --> 03:47:50,280
I recommend SD Snatcher, personally.

7529
03:47:50,600 --> 03:47:51,040
Yeah.

7530
03:47:51,060 --> 03:47:53,780
Oh, wait, what's the difference?

7531
03:47:56,460 --> 03:47:58,460
Also, Skeleton, I love your cat.

7532
03:48:00,280 --> 03:48:01,680
Post more of your cat.

7533
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:05,040
Yeah, it's very expensive getting it though.

7534
03:48:06,220 --> 03:48:07,780
And I don't have a...

7535
03:48:07,780 --> 03:48:09,000
I don't have...

7536
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:11,300
I might actually have to emulate it to be honest.

7537
03:48:12,340 --> 03:48:13,680
But I can do that now.

7538
03:48:14,060 --> 03:48:14,780
I can...

7539
03:48:14,780 --> 03:48:15,400
I can do that.

7540
03:48:15,540 --> 03:48:17,640
So, yeah.

7541
03:48:18,400 --> 03:48:19,780
Usually, I like to...

7542
03:48:19,780 --> 03:48:20,760
I don't know.

7543
03:48:21,060 --> 03:48:26,460
I feel more authentic if I play things as they originally were.

7544
03:48:26,620 --> 03:48:31,080
Like, you know, how I played Twin Snakes with my actual GameCube and stuff like that.

7545
03:48:32,520 --> 03:48:34,380
Thank you for the five gift.

7546
03:48:34,460 --> 03:48:36,800
I feel bad calling you that.

7547
03:48:36,920 --> 03:48:37,700
Mike Tyson.

7548
03:48:40,820 --> 03:48:42,300
Thank you for the five gift.

7549
03:48:42,480 --> 03:48:43,440
Thank you.

7550
03:48:47,460 --> 03:48:48,020
Mr.

7551
03:48:51,060 --> 03:48:51,500
Rats.

7552
03:48:58,180 --> 03:48:59,220
But, yeah.

7553
03:49:01,320 --> 03:49:02,640
Don't call him that.

7554
03:49:02,760 --> 03:49:03,500
I'm sorry.

7555
03:49:08,200 --> 03:49:12,100
Sega CD is hard to set up and Sega has been cool with emulation.

7556
03:49:12,400 --> 03:49:12,900
Oh, okay.

7557
03:49:15,460 --> 03:49:16,500
That's good to know.

7558
03:49:16,680 --> 03:49:19,620
Because I don't even have a way to...

7559
03:49:19,620 --> 03:49:28,680
I haven't looked into... even a way to port the console onto my computer, you know?

7560
03:49:31,160 --> 03:49:32,640
Diver, thank you.

7561
03:49:32,960 --> 03:49:36,280
If the notification for this doesn't show, you can call me a simp direct...

7562
03:49:37,200 --> 03:49:38,320
Yo, oh wait.

7563
03:49:39,360 --> 03:49:40,480
Which one was that?

7564
03:49:42,420 --> 03:49:44,200
I think there's more than one.

7565
03:49:50,090 --> 03:49:50,610
Wait.

7566
03:49:51,930 --> 03:49:55,730
Having a list actually made me think about what I can do and want to do.

7567
03:49:55,870 --> 03:49:57,250
A summer list was a good idea.

7568
03:49:57,610 --> 03:49:58,230
I'm glad!

7569
03:50:01,630 --> 03:50:03,150
Have you watched Very Important People?

7570
03:50:03,330 --> 03:50:03,950
So funny.

7571
03:50:04,070 --> 03:50:04,550
I have not.

7572
03:50:05,190 --> 03:50:06,310
I have not, I have not.

7573
03:50:07,290 --> 03:50:10,650
I think actually... wait, are the donuts actually backed up?

7574
03:50:10,790 --> 03:50:11,830
I'm confused now.

7575
03:50:13,750 --> 03:50:17,050
Maybe they don't show on the screen, but they do actually get backed up.

7576
03:50:17,530 --> 03:50:17,950
Interesting.

7577
03:50:20,670 --> 03:50:21,410
Interesting, interesting.

7578
03:50:21,790 --> 03:50:22,570
They seem to be.

7579
03:50:23,070 --> 03:50:24,650
Yeah, because I see yours too, Vera.

7580
03:50:25,690 --> 03:50:27,030
Good luck on the karaoke relay.

7581
03:50:27,210 --> 03:50:27,950
It's such a stacked event.

7582
03:50:28,070 --> 03:50:28,370
Have fun.

7583
03:50:28,790 --> 03:50:31,470
Yeah, I'm still... I'll be honest, I'm still trying to...

7584
03:50:32,470 --> 03:50:35,930
I'm still trying to think of what songs I want to sing.

7585
03:50:38,030 --> 03:50:38,410
But...

7586
03:50:39,910 --> 03:50:41,230
Maybe I like Very Important People.

7587
03:50:42,090 --> 03:50:43,170
Oh, by Dropout.

7588
03:50:43,210 --> 03:50:44,150
Oh, it's by Dropout.

7589
03:50:44,390 --> 03:50:45,410
If you want more improv.

7590
03:50:47,470 --> 03:50:48,350
Interesting, interesting.

7591
03:50:53,370 --> 03:50:56,310
The summer list sent you into an existential crisis?

7592
03:50:56,670 --> 03:50:57,070
Why?

7593
03:50:58,570 --> 03:51:00,550
It's just thinking of stuff you want to do.

7594
03:51:00,710 --> 03:51:02,950
It doesn't have to be like a goal list or anything.

7595
03:51:03,090 --> 03:51:05,370
It can be just like, I want to...

7596
03:51:06,390 --> 03:51:08,330
I want to... I want to eat a hamburger.

7597
03:51:09,110 --> 03:51:10,910
I want to grill my own hamburger.

7598
03:51:15,950 --> 03:51:19,610
I think I have an idea for what I want to do for the karaoke.

7599
03:51:20,970 --> 03:51:21,390
But...

7600
03:51:21,970 --> 03:51:23,610
I'm also kind of like...

7601
03:51:26,890 --> 03:51:27,310
Like,

7602
03:51:32,860 --> 03:51:33,340
I don't know.

7603
03:51:34,960 --> 03:51:36,400
I don't want to be that person.

7604
03:51:36,860 --> 03:51:37,320
That's all.

7605
03:51:39,280 --> 03:51:41,760
Because I wanted to do like all Metal Gear songs.

7606
03:51:43,140 --> 03:51:45,800
And have it like kind of Metal Gear themed, but...

7607
03:51:48,080 --> 03:51:48,920
I don't know.

7608
03:51:49,520 --> 03:51:51,780
People have asked for like a Metal Gear karaoke.

7609
03:51:51,780 --> 03:51:53,860
And I'd totally be down for that.

7610
03:51:54,120 --> 03:51:54,560
But...

7611
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:56,340
There's honestly not that many.

7612
03:51:57,080 --> 03:51:57,560
Haruka!

7613
03:51:58,240 --> 03:51:58,720
Arigato!

7614
03:51:59,720 --> 03:52:00,200
Hamburger!

7615
03:52:00,320 --> 03:52:00,740
Arigato!

7616
03:52:01,380 --> 03:52:01,640
Hehehe.

7617
03:52:04,020 --> 03:52:04,500
Hmm.

7618
03:52:07,300 --> 03:52:08,980
Do it, do it.

7619
03:52:10,380 --> 03:52:12,380
Oh, Metal Gear Rising does have a lot of songs.

7620
03:52:12,460 --> 03:52:13,120
I guess that's true.

7621
03:52:13,380 --> 03:52:15,500
I was always thinking of Metal Gear Solid.

7622
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:17,620
Instead of...

7623
03:52:17,620 --> 03:52:18,980
How long is each person's segment?

7624
03:52:19,160 --> 03:52:20,540
About 20 minutes?

7625
03:52:21,300 --> 03:52:21,820
So...

7626
03:52:22,380 --> 03:52:22,900
Hmm.

7627
03:52:23,160 --> 03:52:24,440
That's why I was just like...

7628
03:52:24,440 --> 03:52:25,140
Well, you know...

7629
03:52:25,140 --> 03:52:26,420
If someone...

7630
03:52:26,420 --> 03:52:27,260
If someone's just like...

7631
03:52:27,260 --> 03:52:27,420
Wow.

7632
03:52:27,920 --> 03:52:29,460
Maybe Mint is kind of cool.

7633
03:52:29,840 --> 03:52:31,020
They have to know...

7634
03:52:31,580 --> 03:52:34,040
The brain rot that they're getting into as well.

7635
03:52:36,540 --> 03:52:38,200
Just a little bit, maybe.

7636
03:52:39,600 --> 03:52:40,540
And also...

7637
03:52:40,540 --> 03:52:41,780
Even though it's Metal Gear songs...

7638
03:52:42,080 --> 03:52:43,320
They're still good songs.

7639
03:52:44,160 --> 03:52:44,680
So...

7640
03:52:44,680 --> 03:52:46,060
It's not that they're bad songs.

7641
03:52:48,880 --> 03:52:50,120
Only Limp Bizkit.

7642
03:52:50,540 --> 03:52:50,660
Hahaha.

7643
03:52:51,700 --> 03:52:58,840
It's another improv show where they take comedians and put them in costumes and makeup and they improv their way through the interview with Vic Michaelis.

7644
03:52:59,620 --> 03:53:01,060
It's so funny to see their improv.

7645
03:53:01,220 --> 03:53:01,980
Also, good luck with karaoke.

7646
03:53:02,220 --> 03:53:02,700
Thank you!

7647
03:53:03,740 --> 03:53:05,140
All the licensed songs...

7648
03:53:05,140 --> 03:53:05,460
Oh!

7649
03:53:06,500 --> 03:53:07,740
That's kind of fun, right?

7650
03:53:09,100 --> 03:53:11,040
Where it's like technically Metal Gear songs.

7651
03:53:11,900 --> 03:53:13,140
Have you played Death Stranding?

7652
03:53:13,200 --> 03:53:15,220
Actually, I was just thinking about that.

7653
03:53:15,260 --> 03:53:15,620
Oh my gosh.

7654
03:53:15,800 --> 03:53:18,620
I was just thinking about how I was like...

7655
03:53:18,620 --> 03:53:22,820
Man, I think I will start playing more Death Stranding in my off time.

7656
03:53:23,020 --> 03:53:24,840
I say more, but like...

7657
03:53:24,840 --> 03:53:27,180
I haven't touched it in a long time.

7658
03:53:27,360 --> 03:53:29,940
But I've definitely been thinking about it.

7659
03:53:32,540 --> 03:53:34,600
Take on me.

7660
03:53:35,240 --> 03:53:36,780
Take on me.

7661
03:53:37,390 --> 03:53:39,420
Take me home.

7662
03:53:40,430 --> 03:53:41,680
Take on me.

7663
03:53:42,430 --> 03:53:43,860
I'll be home.

7664
03:53:45,360 --> 03:53:47,480
In a day or two.

7665
03:53:55,890 --> 03:53:57,390
Death Stranding is an experience.

7666
03:53:58,190 --> 03:53:59,070
Wait, it's home?

7667
03:53:59,950 --> 03:54:00,850
Well, I don't know.

7668
03:54:03,310 --> 03:54:03,830
Take...

7669
03:54:04,590 --> 03:54:06,110
Take on me lyrics.

7670
03:54:08,470 --> 03:54:09,510
Take on...

7671
03:54:09,510 --> 03:54:09,650
Oh!

7672
03:54:09,670 --> 03:54:11,430
I'll be gone.

7673
03:54:12,090 --> 03:54:14,010
In a day or two.

7674
03:54:15,250 --> 03:54:16,110
I need the...

7675
03:54:16,110 --> 03:54:16,610
I need water.

7676
03:54:16,870 --> 03:54:17,630
I've been out of...

7677
03:54:17,630 --> 03:54:19,570
I've been out of water for like...

7678
03:54:19,570 --> 03:54:21,070
Two hours now.

7679
03:54:35,890 --> 03:54:38,050
I need to get up and I need to...

7680
03:54:38,050 --> 03:54:41,090
I don't have to go to...

7681
03:54:41,810 --> 03:54:42,530
Take care of my health.

7682
03:54:42,530 --> 03:54:44,390
It's slowly going to be dark up again.

7683
03:54:44,390 --> 03:54:44,590
But it'll get better back here later.

7684
03:54:44,590 --> 03:54:45,130
It does look pretty fine.

7685
03:54:45,130 --> 03:54:46,450
from...

7686
03:54:46,450 --> 03:54:47,130
the thorns and...

7687
03:54:47,130 --> 03:54:48,150
from...

7688
03:54:48,150 --> 03:54:48,610
But, you know.

7689
03:54:49,110 --> 03:54:50,070
Let me just see if I can catch anything...

7690
03:54:50,070 --> 03:54:52,370
in this...

7691
03:54:54,690 --> 03:54:55,190
bench...

7692
03:54:58,590 --> 03:55:00,710
Stop playing the sad music, I'm gonna cry.

7693
03:55:00,810 --> 03:55:02,410
It's not sad, it's relaxing.

7694
03:55:03,190 --> 03:55:05,070
It's relaxing time.

7695
03:55:06,070 --> 03:55:09,270
In fact, it's making me tired.

7696
03:55:10,730 --> 03:55:12,570
It's making me sleepy overall.

7697
03:55:14,170 --> 03:55:16,030
Oh wow, oh my gosh, it's almost midnight.

7698
03:55:16,410 --> 03:55:20,130
I might actually head out in about 5 minutes.

7699
03:55:21,150 --> 03:55:23,710
So that I can get rest for tomorrow.

7700
03:55:25,590 --> 03:55:26,390
And um...

7701
03:55:28,670 --> 03:55:29,070
Yeah.

7702
03:55:32,690 --> 03:55:34,010
Why do I have so many messages?

7703
03:55:34,210 --> 03:55:34,350
Oh.

7704
03:55:36,930 --> 03:55:37,330
Nice.

7705
03:55:38,390 --> 03:55:39,870
Oh my gosh, wait, I have so many messages.

7706
03:55:40,070 --> 03:55:41,470
Okay, I have stuff to do tonight.

7707
03:55:43,830 --> 03:55:45,830
Mata played Halo recently, fancy trying it.

7708
03:55:45,850 --> 03:55:47,750
Oh, yes, actually we talked about that earlier.

7709
03:55:49,090 --> 03:55:51,110
And yes, I am interested.

7710
03:55:51,370 --> 03:55:53,270
I just have to...

7711
03:55:54,470 --> 03:55:55,990
I have to...

7712
03:55:56,600 --> 03:55:57,410
Just do it.

7713
03:55:58,350 --> 03:56:00,130
I was kind of like...

7714
03:56:03,310 --> 03:56:05,910
Halo is one of those series that...

7715
03:56:05,910 --> 03:56:06,930
Kind of like...

7716
03:56:07,630 --> 03:56:11,490
With Metal Gear, I was overwhelmed by...

7717
03:56:12,510 --> 03:56:15,370
I was overwhelmed by...

7718
03:56:16,490 --> 03:56:18,470
Where to start and everything.

7719
03:56:20,480 --> 03:56:22,590
Now I feel that way with Halo.

7720
03:56:22,590 --> 03:56:23,310
You know?

7721
03:56:27,330 --> 03:56:28,110
Good night, Mint.

7722
03:56:28,170 --> 03:56:28,970
Thanks for the stream today.

7723
03:56:29,290 --> 03:56:29,990
Good night!

7724
03:56:32,350 --> 03:56:34,330
No, it's not that I dislike FPS.

7725
03:56:34,790 --> 03:56:36,530
I actually very much like FPS.

7726
03:56:36,770 --> 03:56:39,130
I'm not good at FPS, but I like it.

7727
03:56:40,410 --> 03:56:41,430
I like it.

7728
03:56:41,450 --> 03:56:41,730
I'm just...

7729
03:56:41,730 --> 03:56:43,170
I'm not good at it, but I think it's fine.

7730
03:56:46,130 --> 03:56:46,530
Yeah.

7731
03:56:48,990 --> 03:56:50,250
Sorry we overwhelmed you.

7732
03:56:50,250 --> 03:56:51,430
No, it's not you guys.

7733
03:56:51,570 --> 03:56:53,930
It's overwhelming for me to know...

7734
03:56:54,430 --> 03:56:57,290
Where do I start, you know?

7735
03:56:57,530 --> 03:57:00,430
So, once I'm to that point though, I will ask.

7736
03:57:00,630 --> 03:57:02,910
Once I'm to the point of saying like...

7737
03:57:02,910 --> 03:57:05,270
Hey, I'm ready to play...

7738
03:57:05,270 --> 03:57:07,410
I'm ready to play...

7739
03:57:10,670 --> 03:57:12,150
Ready to play...

7740
03:57:12,150 --> 03:57:13,490
I almost said Metal Gear.

7741
03:57:13,750 --> 03:57:14,230
Halo.

7742
03:57:14,470 --> 03:57:15,390
Then I will.

7743
03:57:15,650 --> 03:57:16,130
Yeah.

7744
03:57:17,190 --> 03:57:18,810
Release order is always a good way.

7745
03:57:18,810 --> 03:57:19,350
What?

7746
03:57:19,450 --> 03:57:20,650
So just start at Halo 1?

7747
03:57:23,070 --> 03:57:24,050
My aim is good?

7748
03:57:24,210 --> 03:57:24,830
You think so?

7749
03:57:27,370 --> 03:57:28,350
You think so?

7750
03:57:29,610 --> 03:57:30,350
Oh my gosh.

7751
03:57:30,730 --> 03:57:32,990
It's like the first time anyone has ever said that to me.

7752
03:57:33,130 --> 03:57:34,270
My aim is good?

7753
03:57:34,930 --> 03:57:36,910
Do you think I'm a gamer for real?

7754
03:57:38,310 --> 03:57:41,150
This is maybe the best day of my life.

7755
03:57:41,850 --> 03:57:42,650
Oh my gosh.

7756
03:57:43,830 --> 03:57:44,950
I have a good aim.

7757
03:57:49,330 --> 03:57:58,290
Yeah, I think I have my aim in mind.

7758
03:57:59,850 --> 03:58:01,530
I don't know...

7759
03:58:01,530 --> 03:58:03,890
I think I already know how to direct this game.

7760
03:58:04,450 --> 03:58:08,970
I know how to make it a little bit better.

7761
03:58:08,970 --> 03:58:09,350
Maybe.

7762
03:58:09,770 --> 03:58:11,510
If it is working, it will be...

7763
03:58:15,790 --> 03:58:16,730
Just continue.

7764
03:58:16,730 --> 03:58:18,170
I have used enough aim.

7765
03:58:18,930 --> 03:58:20,310
I have to fix it.

7766
03:58:20,310 --> 03:58:21,690
He's talking about his overwhelming brain.

7767
03:58:39,070 --> 03:58:42,410
I mean... my hands are up!

7768
03:58:44,950 --> 03:58:47,890
I have thought about Splinter Cell.

7769
03:58:48,130 --> 03:58:50,290
But truly, honestly...

7770
03:58:50,290 --> 03:58:52,310
From what I heard...

7771
03:58:54,150 --> 03:58:56,410
Like, I don't like stealth games.

7772
03:58:57,430 --> 03:58:59,230
I don't like stealth games.

7773
03:58:59,570 --> 03:59:02,650
And what kept me going with Metal Gear is the story.

7774
03:59:03,210 --> 03:59:05,890
And so, knowing that the story...

7775
03:59:05,890 --> 03:59:07,490
I've heard that the story for Splinter...

7776
03:59:07,490 --> 03:59:09,070
You can correct me if I'm wrong, but...

7777
03:59:09,070 --> 03:59:12,870
I've heard that the story for Splinter Cell is just kind of...

7778
03:59:14,110 --> 03:59:17,330
But also, it's like more stealthy than...

7779
03:59:18,230 --> 03:59:19,010
Metal Gear.

7780
03:59:23,870 --> 03:59:24,350
Right?

7781
03:59:24,630 --> 03:59:25,450
Am I wrong?

7782
03:59:26,190 --> 03:59:27,470
Metal Gear is a stealth game?

7783
03:59:29,330 --> 03:59:30,570
Down to play Devil May Cry?

7784
03:59:30,770 --> 03:59:30,990
Yup.

7785
03:59:31,550 --> 03:59:32,310
I am.

7786
03:59:34,510 --> 03:59:35,470
Tom Clancy.

7787
03:59:36,010 --> 03:59:37,050
Who is that guy?

7788
03:59:37,230 --> 03:59:38,890
I know it's Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.

7789
03:59:38,970 --> 03:59:39,450
You know what?

7790
03:59:39,510 --> 03:59:40,930
You would probably never believe this...

7791
03:59:40,930 --> 03:59:42,330
But a long time ago...

7792
03:59:42,330 --> 03:59:44,650
I don't remember how I acquired this...

7793
03:59:44,650 --> 03:59:48,190
But I used to have a full Splinter Cell...

7794
03:59:49,610 --> 03:59:50,890
Standee in my room.

7795
03:59:53,430 --> 03:59:55,150
Never having played it...

7796
03:59:55,910 --> 03:59:58,050
Not knowing anything about it...

7797
03:59:59,470 --> 04:00:01,290
I don't remember how I acquired it...

7798
04:00:01,670 --> 04:00:02,830
Let me see if I can find like...

7799
04:00:02,830 --> 04:00:03,570
Okay, if I look up...

7800
04:00:04,730 --> 04:00:05,530
Splinter Cell...

7801
04:00:05,530 --> 04:00:08,150
If I can see like what the image was...

7802
04:00:15,810 --> 04:00:16,850
Maybe if I look...

7803
04:00:16,850 --> 04:00:18,370
I wonder if I look up Standee...

7804
04:00:18,370 --> 04:00:20,270
I wonder if I can even find it from that...

7805
04:00:20,270 --> 04:00:22,970
If I can find like a similar one...

7806
04:00:23,510 --> 04:00:23,910
What?

7807
04:00:24,830 --> 04:00:25,510
What the hell?

7808
04:00:26,890 --> 04:00:27,530
What?

7809
04:00:28,570 --> 04:00:29,710
Oh my god...

7810
04:00:29,710 --> 04:00:30,390
What?

7811
04:00:30,630 --> 04:00:31,270
Wait...

7812
04:00:31,270 --> 04:00:31,850
What?

7813
04:00:32,010 --> 04:00:32,530
I just...

7814
04:00:32,530 --> 04:00:33,190
Okay, wait...

7815
04:00:33,190 --> 04:00:33,410
What?

7816
04:00:33,830 --> 04:00:36,070
I just looked up in Google...

7817
04:00:36,070 --> 04:00:37,850
Splinter Cell Standee...

7818
04:00:37,850 --> 04:00:39,990
And this is what appeared!

7819
04:00:41,030 --> 04:00:42,310
This is what appeared!

7820
04:00:46,160 --> 04:00:46,800
Me!

7821
04:00:53,320 --> 04:00:54,880
Why am I here?

7822
04:01:00,030 --> 04:01:02,830
Oh my gosh, that's so funny!

7823
04:01:03,610 --> 04:01:05,330
That is so funny!

7824
04:01:05,430 --> 04:01:10,030
I cannot believe that that even showed up!

7825
04:01:10,250 --> 04:01:14,150
It was from our virtual YouTubers on Reddit!

7826
04:01:14,810 --> 04:01:15,570
Wow...

7827
04:01:15,570 --> 04:01:17,490
That's really funny...

7828
04:01:20,550 --> 04:01:21,310
Wow...

7829
04:01:22,890 --> 04:01:26,470
I see a Standee that's like on eBay...

7830
04:01:26,470 --> 04:01:27,710
But that's not the one I had...

7831
04:01:27,710 --> 04:01:29,870
Because the one I had distinctly had the...

7832
04:01:29,870 --> 04:01:30,490
It looked...

7833
04:01:30,490 --> 04:01:31,970
He was like holding his gun up...

7834
04:01:31,970 --> 04:01:35,870
And he had the little goggles on his eyes...

7835
04:01:36,570 --> 04:01:38,490
You are more love than you think...

7836
04:01:38,490 --> 04:01:38,830
I don't...

7837
04:01:38,830 --> 04:01:40,430
I don't know if that's love...

7838
04:01:42,050 --> 04:01:44,190
I don't know if that's love...

7839
04:01:44,710 --> 04:01:46,170
Baby, don't hurt me...

7840
04:01:47,190 --> 04:01:48,210
Don't hurt me...

7841
04:01:48,210 --> 04:01:49,850
No more...

7842
04:01:51,230 --> 04:01:51,710
Hmm...

7843
04:01:51,710 --> 04:01:53,970
I may be touching chairs...

7844
04:01:55,810 --> 04:01:56,770
That's funny...

7845
04:01:56,770 --> 04:01:57,610
That's so silly...

7846
04:01:57,610 --> 04:01:59,070
I wonder when that was posted...

7847
04:02:01,930 --> 04:02:02,410
Um...

7848
04:02:02,410 --> 04:02:03,150
Yeah...

7849
04:02:04,990 --> 04:02:07,230
So that's my only exposure...

7850
04:02:07,230 --> 04:02:07,770
Okay, no...

7851
04:02:07,770 --> 04:02:09,050
No, not my only exposure...

7852
04:02:09,050 --> 04:02:11,270
That's one of my exposures with Splinter Cell...

7853
04:02:12,090 --> 04:02:17,250
And my other exposure is watching that cutscene where it references Metal Gear...

7854
04:02:19,110 --> 04:02:21,930
I just realized I sent the Streamlabs without my name...

7855
04:02:21,930 --> 04:02:22,670
So it's from me!

7856
04:02:22,990 --> 04:02:24,330
Also, can you sing me a happy birthday?

7857
04:02:24,530 --> 04:02:25,410
Of course!

7858
04:02:26,030 --> 04:02:26,510
Oh my gosh!

7859
04:02:26,510 --> 04:02:26,750
Oh my gosh!

7860
04:02:26,750 --> 04:02:27,550
Oh!

7861
04:02:28,870 --> 04:02:30,990
Is it the one that's the Akadono?

7862
04:02:31,270 --> 04:02:31,950
Oh my gosh...

7863
04:02:31,950 --> 04:02:32,990
Haisumi, why?

7864
04:02:33,590 --> 04:02:35,530
Why would you send another Super Chat after that?

7865
04:02:36,390 --> 04:02:38,410
Can't wait to hear you sing for the Karaoke Relay!

7866
04:02:38,450 --> 04:02:39,750
Glad it's happening on my birthday!

7867
04:02:39,890 --> 04:02:40,910
Good luck Boss, and have fun!

7868
04:02:42,490 --> 04:02:43,290
Thank you!

7869
04:02:45,290 --> 04:02:47,670
Happy birthday to you!

7870
04:02:48,750 --> 04:02:50,810
Happy birthday to you!

7871
04:02:51,770 --> 04:02:54,310
Happy birthday dear Haisumi!

7872
04:02:55,890 --> 04:02:56,530
Happy birthday dear Haisumi!

7873
04:02:56,530 --> 04:02:56,730
Haisumi!

7874
04:02:56,750 --> 04:03:01,130
Happy birthday to you!

7875
04:03:03,710 --> 04:03:04,630
Happy birthday!

7876
04:03:12,270 --> 04:03:13,790
I don't know actually.

7877
04:03:13,990 --> 04:03:16,150
I don't know anything about that.

7878
04:03:16,230 --> 04:03:20,090
Let me write that down and I will say something on stream.

7879
04:03:20,390 --> 04:03:21,450
Don't tell me what to do.

7880
04:03:28,910 --> 04:03:31,230
Accepting gifts of Kai.

7881
04:03:33,110 --> 04:03:37,650
If I am able to accept gifts, which I don't see why I wouldn't be able to.

7882
04:03:37,730 --> 04:03:46,230
I would only ask that they are of a small size because I will be going somewhere else.

7883
04:03:46,270 --> 04:03:49,630
I won't be going back home after I cut off Kai.

7884
04:03:54,390 --> 04:03:55,590
No bombs.

7885
04:03:55,870 --> 04:03:56,730
Yeah, obviously.

7886
04:03:56,750 --> 04:03:59,350
So yeah, nothing too big please.

7887
04:04:01,430 --> 04:04:03,790
I took the garbage out by myself this week.

7888
04:04:03,930 --> 04:04:08,950
So I bought myself the $1600 arcade cabinet as a little treat.

7889
04:04:09,210 --> 04:04:12,770
Bringing you a big crapper.

7890
04:04:12,870 --> 04:04:13,390
Got it.

7891
04:04:15,070 --> 04:04:19,310
If I can find one in Japan, I will maybe get a big crapper.

7892
04:04:19,470 --> 04:04:20,010
I will.

7893
04:04:21,190 --> 04:04:23,250
And then I will leave it on during streams.

7894
04:04:23,550 --> 04:04:25,490
So you can hear it in the background.

7895
04:04:25,490 --> 04:04:27,430
All the time.

7896
04:04:27,790 --> 04:04:29,890
You'll always hear it.

7897
04:04:30,130 --> 04:04:31,390
All the time.

7898
04:04:34,670 --> 04:04:35,950
Smash them on stream.

7899
04:04:36,850 --> 04:04:37,950
Ask Gosu.

7900
04:04:38,090 --> 04:04:39,370
Thanks for the five gifted.

7901
04:04:39,470 --> 04:04:39,850
Thank you.

7902
04:04:40,890 --> 04:04:42,670
Set it up to react to Donos.

7903
04:04:43,690 --> 04:04:45,190
No one will donate again.

7904
04:04:46,650 --> 04:04:49,330
No one will ever want to send anything ever again.

7905
04:04:52,010 --> 04:04:53,450
You mean Clapper.

7906
04:04:54,930 --> 04:04:55,370
No...

7907
04:04:58,710 --> 04:04:59,150
No...

7908
04:05:01,830 --> 04:05:02,270
Ah...

7909
04:05:04,690 --> 04:05:06,810
No pipe bombs that has off-Kai gifts?

7910
04:05:07,790 --> 04:05:10,590
Oh my gosh, you give me a gift and you're like check your inventory.

7911
04:05:12,150 --> 04:05:18,830
It's like when Ocelot leaves the bomb in my inventory.

7912
04:05:20,710 --> 04:05:21,630
Ghost of Mint!

7913
04:05:21,890 --> 04:05:22,750
Thanks for the stream.

7914
04:05:22,790 --> 04:05:24,350
Work has been brutal the past few weeks.

7915
04:05:24,470 --> 04:05:24,990
No microphones.

7916
04:05:28,410 --> 04:05:32,530
So this was my much-needed dopamine to start the weekend.

7917
04:05:37,970 --> 04:05:40,090
Full bomb in my pocket.

7918
04:05:40,570 --> 04:05:44,470
You hand me a package and it's like beeping and you're just like...

7919
04:05:44,870 --> 04:05:45,650
Here you go.

7920
04:05:45,970 --> 04:05:47,770
My present to you.

7921
04:05:50,490 --> 04:05:51,590
Here you go.

7922
04:05:51,590 --> 04:05:57,150
Well, I talked over them what I was initially gonna do.

7923
04:05:57,430 --> 04:05:58,210
My bad.

7924
04:05:59,850 --> 04:06:00,870
Otsuminto, everybody!

7925
04:06:01,630 --> 04:06:05,330
Do a 24-hour Cam of the Clapper when you're on vacation and be like...

7926
04:06:05,330 --> 04:06:05,930
You never left!

7927
04:06:06,030 --> 04:06:06,350
Exactly!

7928
04:06:08,170 --> 04:06:09,450
Thank you, Kato Ruffin.

7929
04:06:09,490 --> 04:06:09,950
Thank you.

7930
04:06:11,330 --> 04:06:14,310
I will see you guys tomorrow if you come for the karaoke.

7931
04:06:21,590 --> 04:06:23,330
Yeah, I think that's all I got.

7932
04:06:24,690 --> 04:06:26,010
But yeah, karaoke tomorrow.

7933
04:06:26,210 --> 04:06:27,810
So be there or be...

7934
04:06:28,510 --> 04:06:28,950
square.

7935
04:06:29,450 --> 04:06:30,090
Or something.

7936
04:06:30,270 --> 04:06:30,690
I don't know.

7937
04:06:32,050 --> 04:06:33,790
No one wants to be a square wisp.

7938
04:06:33,970 --> 04:06:36,010
Everyone wants to be a round, plump wisp.

7939
04:06:36,190 --> 04:06:36,630
Right?

7940
04:06:38,930 --> 04:06:39,930
Fake me, thank you!

7941
04:06:40,490 --> 04:06:42,430
Left 4 Dead 2 is such a rush.

7942
04:06:42,970 --> 04:06:44,570
Even just as a viewer, I know.

7943
04:06:44,990 --> 04:06:46,150
Sorry if it was frustrating.

7944
04:06:46,510 --> 04:06:47,230
Or loud.

7945
04:06:47,470 --> 04:06:48,790
Or so much.

7946
04:06:49,130 --> 04:06:50,050
At any point.

7947
04:06:50,050 --> 04:06:51,850
But I hope you guys had fun.

7948
04:06:51,990 --> 04:06:53,570
Thanks for watching, and thanks for...

7949
04:06:53,570 --> 04:06:55,830
hanging out with me, as always!

7950
04:06:57,270 --> 04:06:58,130
Bye-bye!

7951
04:06:58,830 --> 04:06:59,790
Otsu Boston!

7952
04:07:03,610 --> 04:07:04,570
Good night.
