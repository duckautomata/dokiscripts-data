1
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,140
Three, two, one, swap.

2
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,540
Hello, everybody!

3
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,280
Hello!

4
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,520
Buddy!

5
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,060
Welcome!

6
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,460
Oh, welcome!

7
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,260
So, um...

8
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,180
We have a server dedicated to our...

9
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,540
By the way, the sun is setting, by the way.

10
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,860
Oh, I'm going in!

11
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,060
I'm going in!

12
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,580
Oh, God!

13
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,860
Wait, where are you?

14
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,000
Wait, where did you...

15
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,820
Oh, my God.

16
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,020
Why are you out here?

17
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,900
Oh, thank God!

18
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,700
Because there are zombies around me!

19
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,080
What do you mean, why am I out here?

20
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,900
We gotta find our hearts!

21
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,700
I ate some zombie meat, so now I have...

22
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,800
Wait, what do you mean, look at your heart?

23
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,700
I can't see your heart!

24
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,860
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

25
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,680
We're gonna die.

26
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,720
Yeah, so this might be the fastest death, because it's already night.

27
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,660
I mean, we could dig a hole.

28
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,580
In the water?

29
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
Literally, right...

30
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,900
Oh, wait, we've got cinematic mode here.

31
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,980
Okay, we gotta find a hole.

32
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,060
Let's just go and find...

33
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
We could find a village, I'm sure.

34
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,480
Just avoid the zombies and everything.

35
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,440
We're fine!

36
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,720
Hey, guys, welcome to a hardcore Minecraft preview.

37
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,900
So, Min and I were talking...

38
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,940
Min apparently didn't realize what it meant when I said, like, hardcore Minecraft.

39
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,800
No, no.

40
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,260
We stream until we beat the...

41
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,380
I knew what you meant.

42
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,900
No, no, you were like, so what do we do if we die during the end...

43
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,140
No, no, no, I was just like...

44
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,460
And I was like, we restart.

45
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,700
What do we do?

46
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,100
What do we do?

47
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,540
I was just like...

48
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,020
You know, I was just like, oh, my God.

49
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,960
Oh, my God, I found a village!

50
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,600
Oh, my God.

51
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Oh, my God, there's a village!

52
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
Okay, okay, okay.

53
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,280
I knew we were gonna find a village.

54
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,620
I knew we were gonna find...

55
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,160
No, I had a gamer instinct.

56
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,840
I'm literally leading the way.

57
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,740
No, you were like...

58
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,420
This was literally like 50-50.

59
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,500
It was a life or death.

60
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,000
You were like, when we die, we die.

61
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,520
I know I did not say that.

62
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,380
I'm asleep.

63
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,260
Get your own bed.

64
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,760
Go...

65
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,400
Fuck you.

66
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,140
Get your own bed.

67
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm shutting the door.

68
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,920
This is my home and I'm living here.

69
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,140
Okay, okay.

70
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm sleeping now, too.

71
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,360
Oh, my God, we already found beds!

72
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,820
Yes!

73
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,280
We did so well.

74
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,020
This is so easy.

75
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,040
We already got our beds for the Minecraft.

76
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,000
Hardcore.

77
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,120
God, easy.

78
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,660
So...

79
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,920
So, we were inspired by...

80
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, shit.

81
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,920
I refreshed my game.

82
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,900
We were inspired...

83
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:53,860
Well, by the Kai and Spice Show Speed playthrough they did months ago where they...

84
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,140
I don't know.

85
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,820
Have you watched the playthrough, Mint?

86
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,140
No, I just...

87
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,060
I don't even know who those people are.

88
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,460
Oh, okay.

89
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,700
So, I was inspired by them and then I told Mint, let's do it.

90
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,420
Anyway, so, I was inspired.

91
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,980
I was watching a bit of it and it took them like 20 plus days, by the way, Mint.

92
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,080
It took them...

93
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,500
What do you mean?

94
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,660
Like, in real time?

95
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,820
Yes, in real time.

96
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,780
They literally...

97
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,840
Like, they would go to bed, wake up, play Minecraft and then die.

98
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,220
Go to bed, wake up, play Minecraft, die.

99
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,740
And then they kept doing it until they beat the...

100
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,100
I think we're better than them.

101
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,200
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

102
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,740
I was like, we must be better.

103
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,820
Like, we have to be better than that.

104
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,640
There's no way it's going to take us...

105
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,360
That's why we gave ourselves one extra day.

106
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,300
We...

107
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,840
We gave ourselves one extra day to see if we could beat Minecraft.

108
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
I think we could beat...

109
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, like, we're...

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,220
Do they even play Minecraft?

111
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,260
Do they even know anything?

112
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,600
Like, I don't...

113
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,400
I don't know.

114
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,180
That's the thing.

115
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,760
I just saw that it took them 20 fucking days to be here.

116
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,500
Wait, I need food.

117
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,360
Is there not food in this village?

118
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,000
Like, where are the food in this village?

119
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,580
Did you take all the food?

120
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm looting.

121
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,900
What have you been doing this entire time?

122
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,380
I'm dying.

123
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,780
I'm literally dying right now.

124
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,120
What have you been doing this entire time?

125
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,560
I was trying to introduce the rules.

126
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,560
I was introducing what's going on.

127
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Oh my god, how am I...

128
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm dying from fire.

129
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,200
Oh my god, wait.

130
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,320
Oh my god!

131
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,100
You just find some damn food!

132
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,740
You didn't even loot everything.

133
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,300
You're not even that great at looting.

134
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,900
I left you one house.

135
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,360
Oh, thank you.

136
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,460
Wow, I'm so fortunate.

137
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,580
Yeah, I left you a house for you, you know?

138
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,460
Wow.

139
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,540
Do you have any more food?

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,740
I only have two potatoes.

141
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,460
Oh, that's all they had?

142
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,260
Yeah, two potatoes and two bread.

143
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:57,920
Trade me.

144
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,600
What do you have?

145
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,460
I'm gonna go here.

146
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,660
I have 12 emeralds.

147
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,440
I want that now.

148
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,780
I have a pumpkin seed.

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,420
How am I missing a health?

150
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,480
How are... because I don't fucking know.

151
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,240
What did you do?

152
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,020
I don't know.

153
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,480
Give me the fucking bread!

154
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,420
I'm eating!

155
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,000
This is a team game!

156
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,900
Get your food!

157
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,980
Oh, okay.

158
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,080
The moment I go kill myself, you have to restart the server.

159
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,380
Look, I'm getting myself berries!

160
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,660
Look, just forage for yourself!

161
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,980
You can't eat the berries!

162
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,680
Yes, you can!

163
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,540
You can't eat the berries!

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,460
What do you mean you can't eat the berries?

165
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,140
Oh, well you can.

166
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,080
I told you!

167
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,780
I didn't realize I just needed a piece of sky.

168
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,360
Yes!

169
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,620
See?

170
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,140
What are you collecting men in here for?

171
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,500
Collecting men?

172
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,290
What are you doing?

173
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,090
What the fuck are you doing?

174
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,090
Why are you collecting them like that?

175
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,350
People can see my stream and what I was doing.

176
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,150
They know I was not doing any of that.

177
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,430
Wait, can they actually...

178
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,410
Wait, did they do this themselves?

179
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,790
I think so.

180
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,830
Those are some freaky men.

181
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,730
This is a freaky village we came across.

182
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,890
This is a freaky village that you found.

183
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,050
Also, take their torches.

184
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,430
Oh yeah, you're right.

185
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:15,790
You're right.

186
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,910
Okay, so how do we...

187
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,430
I forgot how to do the Ender Dragon.

188
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,410
It's been a while.

189
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,110
You're like the Minecraft expert.

190
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,270
I've beaten it like twice.

191
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,710
But...

192
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,730
I was there too.

193
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,530
Actually, I watched a guide that was just like...

194
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,510
You watched a guide?

195
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,950
It was like, so you want to survive in Minecraft hardcore.

196
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,990
Kind of guide, and I watched that.

197
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,850
Oh my god, why am I lagging a little?

198
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,490
It's Minecraft.

199
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,530
Oh, it might be my resource packs.

200
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,070
What?

201
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,190
Oh my god.

202
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,610
It could be.

203
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,450
It could be.

204
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,630
I don't know.

205
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,430
I don't know.

206
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,570
It could be the resource packs.

207
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,230
But...

208
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,230
So I wanted to download...

209
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,990
The reason why we were waiting was because...

210
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,870
I was downloading resource packs.

211
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,870
Yeah, it's always Doki's fault every time we're late.

212
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,210
Okay, that is not true.

213
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,890
When has it not been true in like recent times?

214
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,290
No, no, that is not true.

215
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,770
The last time we had a collab, I knew I wasn't the reason why we're late.

216
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,710
What, like yesterday?

217
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,870
Yeah, yeah, that was not my fault.

218
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,950
I was actually on time.

219
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,070
Why were we late?

220
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,910
I don't even remember.

221
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,690
Because like, some people...

222
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,510
Because of the steam...

223
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,590
Oh wait, it was my fault because I chose the Tuesday.

224
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,050
I...

225
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,660
I chose Tuesday at 3pm.

226
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,690
I'll put the sound...

227
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,190
Is the sound okay now?

228
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,650
How do I sound?

229
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,090
Where are you?

230
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,850
You're over here, okay.

231
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,710
I'm pecking berries.

232
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,650
So what's the plan?

233
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,770
Okay, so...

234
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,330
Can we like start mining for diamonds?

235
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,630
No!

236
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,050
Doki, no!

237
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,030
Why not?

238
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,090
We have to first start...

239
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,810
With iron.

240
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,270
I'm trying to see if there...

241
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,910
Are you lagging that bad?

242
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,050
No, I'm trying...

243
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,250
I'm trying to fucking...

244
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,450
Find a tree so I can get...

245
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:15,790
Stuff.

246
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,410
Oh my gosh, you should've looted better.

247
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,630
I thought you were a gamer.

248
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,250
Oh, I cared about our fans?

249
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,090
Because I was worried that they were confused.

250
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,730
You have to be able to explain things and game at the same time.

251
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,170
Okay, what happened to multitasking?

252
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,110
Because I wanted to be like...

253
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,230
Oh my god, I didn't even put music on.

254
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,210
That's how angry I am.

255
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,970
That's why I'm angry, there was no BGM.

256
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,250
It was just other silence.

257
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,510
I had to listen to her fucking voice.

258
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,850
Get used to it!

259
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,110
Get used to it!

260
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,350
Oh my god, the fucking...

261
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,490
I'm literally gonna see you in like...

262
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,270
Three days.

263
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,430
What do you mean three days?

264
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,310
Well, however many days it is.

265
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,790
Yeah, I was gonna say...

266
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,310
So people thought that like...

267
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,850
You know, you were on your schedule like Saturday.

268
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,250
Oh, yeah, yeah.

269
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,470
People thought that we were actually gonna meet up on Saturday.

270
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,610
And then on my schedule, it's like three different things.

271
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,850
Because she's gonna do it offline.

272
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,310
I know.

273
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,270
I was like, oopsie.

274
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,630
Sorry, everybody.

275
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,730
I made this a little whoopsie-poopsie on my schedule.

276
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,090
Did I grab that?

277
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,090
Alright.

278
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,950
Wait, so what are we supposed to do?

279
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,390
Okay, so first we gotta like get regular iron.

280
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,750
So basically, I think the best bet would be if we go into the mountains...

281
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,530
And we get the iron.

282
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,630
And we like...

283
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,490
Like the ones that aren't in the...

284
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,050
You know how you can find iron not...

285
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,770
Not in the caves?

286
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,250
And then...

289
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:05,850
Oh, so you're...

290
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,710
You're scared then.

291
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,790
I'm not scared.

292
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,610
I'm literally trying to survive.

293
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,590
You don't wanna dig down.

294
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,370
You're scared.

295
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,370
I'm not scared.

296
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,610
We need the...

297
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,390
Then dig down.

298
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,070
Straight down?

299
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,330
Yeah, straight down.

300
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,370
Why don't we find a mountain?

301
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,710
Just dig down.

302
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,970
Okay, I'll dig down right now.

303
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,810
Yeah, do it.

304
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,350
Alright, hold on.

305
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,270
Let me make a little...

306
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,010
Let me make a...

307
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,330
Hold on.

308
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,270
I gotta make a shovel.

309
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,090
Okay, you want me to dig down?

310
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,410
Okay.

311
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,990
Yeah, yeah, dig down.

312
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,470
I'm going.

313
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,490
I'm going.

314
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,070
Hold on.

315
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,750
Come on, you're freaking scared.

316
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,170
I'm not.

317
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,870
I'm trying to...

318
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,510
Let me make a...

319
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,110
Wait, how do I...

320
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,590
Oh, there it is.

321
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,130
Where's my shovel?

322
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,070
Oh, wait.

323
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,330
I need sticks too.

324
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,430
I don't wanna make sticks.

325
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,070
Oh, there we go.

326
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,450
Alright, come on.

327
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,550
You too.

328
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,810
You too.

329
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,910
Don't worry, I'm helping you.

330
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,150
Oh.

331
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,510
Hey, what are you doing?

332
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,570
Come on, come on.

333
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,370
Come on.

334
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,470
Come on.

335
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:53,970
Come on.

336
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,430
Come on.

337
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,870
Dig down, your turn.

338
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,650
We're digging down.

339
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,430
We're digging down.

340
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,170
We're digging down.

341
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,470
Wait, did you...

342
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,750
Oh, now you need a shovel.

343
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,070
While I was trying to make a shovel, you're like, oh, I'm not gonna let you make a shovel.

344
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,750
Now I have one.

345
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,350
You have a shovel.

346
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:07,970
Yeah, go.

347
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:08,830
Yeah, okay, let's go.

348
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:09,850
Yeah, okay.

349
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,090
While you do that, I'm gonna raise your volume a little bit more.

350
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,730
Okay, okay, I'll talk louder.

351
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:14,910
Alright.

352
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,650
Keep going.

353
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,050
Keep going.

354
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,130
Alright, alright.

355
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,030
Oh, sorry, accident.

356
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,110
I don't have a pickaxe either because somebody was...

357
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,110
Oh, I have one.

358
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,750
I have one.

359
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,850
I have two actually.

360
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,710
Oh, you think you'll make me a pickaxe and make me one?

361
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,710
No, I don't think so.

362
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,630
Oh, I don't think so.

363
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,930
Okay, so I guess I don't need a digger now.

364
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,150
I guess I'll just use the crafting table.

365
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,470
Use your hands, use your hands.

366
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,790
Yeah, I'll just use my hands.

367
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,610
Yeah, use your hands, use your hands.

368
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,610
Hey, get back in there.

369
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,790
Get back in there.

370
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,930
Oh, that must've been an accident too.

371
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,450
Oh, you're so clumsy.

373
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,710
I know, I know.

374
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,530
You're so, so clumsy.

375
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,870
Oh, I can't reach anymore.

376
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,630
I can't reach anymore.

377
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,030
Oh.

378
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,590
Oh.

379
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,290
I think we're safe down here.

380
00:17:59,290 --> 00:17:59,970
Oh, what the hell?

381
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,630
How'd you get there?

382
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,770
I don't know.

383
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,530
Guess you didn't dig hard enough.

384
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,570
I'm digging down.

385
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,330
You keep digging my blocks and it just shows that you're too afraid to dig down.

386
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,330
No, no, because somebody won't let me fucking make a pickaxe.

387
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:12,950
Okay, then here.

388
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,230
Come here, come here.

389
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,910
No, I'm making a pickaxe right now.

390
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,470
Oh, you are?

391
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,530
How are you making one?

392
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,450
How are you making one?

393
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,450
Come here.

394
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,110
No, I don't remember the recipe!

395
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,470
There you go.

396
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,210
I just gave you one.

397
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,090
I just gave you one, okay?

398
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:26,790
There you go.

399
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,770
No!

400
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,750
No, you did!

401
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,430
Oh, wait, you did.

402
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:29,930
Yes, I did!

403
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,690
I'm trying to make a fucking...

404
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,910
I'm trying to make a fucking stone pickaxe.

405
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,230
Why are you giving me a...

406
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,850
Oh, because I didn't have stone because all I had was wood.

407
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,810
Come on, dig down, you baby!

408
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,530
Why aren't you digging down?

409
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,390
Dig down, dig down, dig down.

410
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,530
I'm gonna make a stone pickaxe because I wanna win Minecraft.

411
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,810
Somebody here is playing around.

412
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,990
Wait, how do you make a...

413
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,630
Oh, there it is, okay.

414
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,930
Oh, how do you make what?

415
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,930
A stone pickaxe?

416
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:58,910
No.

417
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,170
Dig down, come on, keep digging.

418
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,710
I am digging.

419
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,190
I'm literally catching up.

420
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,730
I'm making a stone pickaxe right now.

421
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,770
I'm literally catching up to you.

422
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,070
Okay, I'm already further, way further down than you.

423
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,210
Oh, yeah?

424
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,610
Yeah.

425
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,390
I hope you drop right into lava.

426
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,170
I hear a zombie.

427
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,050
I think we're gonna drop right into that first.

428
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,190
Oh, we're close, yeah.

429
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,430
Oh, hey.

430
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,890
We literally had like a perfect run set up for us and we're just ruining it.

431
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,730
By the way, we got iron.

432
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,030
I'm done here.

433
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,570
Oh, you got iron?

434
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,590
Oh, me too.

435
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,350
Oh, I got a whole bunch of it.

436
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,890
I'm already done with my job.

437
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,450
We need more iron.

438
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,530
Oh, not diamond.

439
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,610
How do I...

440
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,210
Oh, wait, there's the...

441
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,210
We do need this, though.

442
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,470
We need to eventually be able to craft.

443
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,010
Yeah, I'm making furnaces.

444
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,390
Oh, wait, we need coal.

445
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,850
I forgot.

446
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,590
Yeah, yeah, dummies.

447
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,610
Yeah, idiot.

448
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,050
She doesn't know about logs, you guys.

449
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,650
Oh, my God.

450
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,390
Oh, my God.

451
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,170
Now I do.

452
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,690
So now I don't need to get coal.

453
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,310
Are you out?

454
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,070
Did you leave?

455
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,330
I had what I needed.

456
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,250
What are you still doing there?

457
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,030
Why are you not digging down with me?

458
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,470
I thought we were gonna go find stuff.

459
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,670
I already got...

460
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,510
Oh, wait, no, that's copper.

461
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,110
You said you wanted to go find diamonds.

462
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,090
You didn't even get iron, you got copper.

463
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,330
Oh, my God.

464
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,310
I'm already, like, ten steps ahead of you.

465
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,770
All right.

466
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,530
Wait, do I need to leave first?

467
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,290
Okay, there it is.

468
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:49,570
Okay.

469
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,090
No, I just...

470
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,830
I'm restarting this.

471
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,050
I forgot that you were...

472
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,230
You were down there.

473
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,170
Why would you forget?

474
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,950
Because I covered up the hole.

475
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,730
So you tried to kill me.

476
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,390
And then you literally fell into your own trap.

477
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,370
I was trying to make stuff.

478
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,290
I was trying to make something.

479
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,650
So I covered up your hole because I had to make something.

480
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,570
And I forgot you existed.

481
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,930
Can I go in now?

482
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,410
No, I didn't start the server.

483
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,090
Oh, my God.

484
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,030
It's gonna take forever.

485
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,730
No.

486
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,730
It's gonna take forever.

487
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:29,910
Okay, okay.

488
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,270
I'm okay now.

489
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:31,970
I'm okay.

490
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,010
That was a test run, guys.

491
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,370
Yeah, it was just a test run.

492
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,070
Even though we had a perfect setup, it would have been so good.

493
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,330
I had, like, the starts of iron.

494
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,450
And I had...

495
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,870
We found a village that had everything we needed.

496
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,190
It was just too good.

497
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,090
It was just too easy.

498
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:50,790
I got...

499
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,670
You can log back in.

500
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,090
I just wanted to make it a little bit more exciting.

501
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,130
Now, where are we?

502
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,230
Now, where are we?

503
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,190
Oh, I'm in a tree?

504
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,970
What the hell?

505
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,150
We're in a tree.

506
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,950
Where are you?

507
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,170
Oh, I see you.

508
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,110
There's sheep here.

509
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:02,890
Where are you?

510
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,070
Kill him!

511
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,270
Alright, let's go.

512
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,390
If I fall, I'm afraid of falling.

513
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,050
I'm gonna...

514
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,830
Just fucking fall!

515
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:09,710
I'm gonna...

516
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,810
No, I'm gonna jump into the water.

517
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,130
Oh, my God.

518
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,150
I'm a gamer.

519
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,510
I'm gonna eat up the tree real quick.

520
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,630
Oh, my God, you guys.

521
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,730
Oh, my God.

522
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,710
Parkour civilization right here.

523
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,150
I jumped for the beef and I made it.

524
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,190
I'm gaming.

525
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,830
I didn't lose a single heart.

526
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,990
Oh, my God, me too.

527
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,730
I didn't lose a single heart either.

528
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,270
This is our first run, guys.

529
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,570
This is like the actual start of the run, everybody.

530
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,130
Yeah, yeah.

531
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,330
This is where we started.

532
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,890
The last one, we were testing the server out.

533
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:40,990
Exactly.

534
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,810
She was lagging, you guys.

535
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,470
Like, come on.

536
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,350
Yeah, I was lagging.

537
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,050
I was lagging.

538
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:50,870
I chose a server that's closer to Mint because I figured she needed more.

539
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,250
So, because of that, I'm tech...

540
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,890
Sadly, I have to...

541
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,350
It's an America server.

542
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,370
It's so far from Canada.

543
00:22:59,530 --> 00:22:59,990
Oh, yeah.

544
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,870
Oh, my God.

545
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,570
It's so far.

546
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,290
They're not even connected.

547
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,410
Why is there a skeleton now?

548
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,410
Yeah, there's like an ocean that divides me from America.

549
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,390
That's how far she is from me.

550
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,490
There's a jungle over here.

551
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,950
Wait, where are you?

552
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,750
In the jungle.

553
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,070
The mighty jungle.

554
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,830
The lion sleeps tonight.

555
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,030
Do you know the lyrics?

556
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,890
Yeah, it's from Lion King.

557
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,450
What do you mean?

558
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,750
Why are you just following every time I say it?

559
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,150
Oh, my God.

560
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,710
Where are you?

561
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,250
Wait, Doki, can we get a parrot?

562
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,830
What are you gonna do with the parrot?

563
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,710
It's just gonna die.

564
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,350
No, it's not.

565
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,610
Not if we protect it.

566
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,750
Oh, there's a drown here.

567
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,570
Wait, is this like a monument thing?

568
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,510
Oh, it might be.

569
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,270
Be careful.

570
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,370
There might be guys with...

571
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,370
Wait, what is this?

572
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,270
Where are you?

573
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,690
There's like a thing here.

574
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,590
Oh, I see!

575
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,790
I see a pirate ship.

576
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,890
That's where we can get iron.

577
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,210
What's over here?

578
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,890
Oh, dig for treasure?

579
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,430
Okay.

580
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,450
Wait, you found a map?

581
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,130
No, the people were like, dig for treasure.

582
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,470
I don't think they know what they're talking about.

583
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,270
Oh, I see a drown.

584
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,790
I think he's gonna come and get me.

585
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:11,990
I might die.

586
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,330
You said this would be possible treasure.

587
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,110
I can't see anything.

588
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,310
Oh my god, wait, maybe I can get diamond before you.

589
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,050
Oh, I found a buried treasure map.

590
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,270
It might be where mine is.

591
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,530
Maybe, actually.

592
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,750
Am I gonna die?

593
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,050
I'm gonna die here.

594
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,810
I'm not gonna do this.

595
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,350
Wait, where even are you?

596
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,250
Where did you go?

597
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,150
I'm in a pirate ship, I just said.

598
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,570
Where is the pirate ship?

599
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,410
Oh, ship, sorry.

600
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,090
Oh, wait, there you are.

601
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,250
I think you were just there.

602
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,530
I'm in the pirate ship.

603
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,030
The pirate trip.

604
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,390
Is there anything here?

605
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,550
Not really.

606
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,130
Did you get anything?

607
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,230
I got some carrots.

608
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,370
That's good, we need food.

609
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,870
Oh, whoops.

610
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,930
I'm gonna die.

611
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,110
I'm dying.

612
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,850
You're fine, don't be a pussy.

613
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,950
I'm dying.

614
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,110
I literally lost a heart and a half.

615
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,970
Oh my god, this is literally a chest filled with moss and rotten meat.

616
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,110
I know, it's terrible.

617
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,430
That is terrible.

618
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,770
Look at this bad pirate ship we found.

619
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,130
This pirate ship sucks.

620
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,170
I know, right?

621
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,490
Why did you choose this spawn, Doki?

622
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,570
This is the worst spawn.

623
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,590
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

624
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,210
You want me to...

625
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,930
Let me Google a seed for us.

626
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,210
I'm gonna die.

627
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,910
Best hardcore Minecraft.

628
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:29,910
Is that what you want?

629
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,970
I think I'm actually gonna die.

630
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,250
There's a little baby one, an actual...

631
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,750
Wait, how many hearts do you have?

632
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,470
None of your business.

633
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,550
How many hearts do you have?

634
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,670
There's a drow literally next to us, by the way.

635
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,870
Yeah, I know, I saw him.

636
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,330
You're fine.

637
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:44,970
I'm fine.

638
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,070
You even had carrots.

639
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,370
Punch me, see if I live.

640
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,090
Oh, shit.

641
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,070
I'm gonna die.

642
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,590
Wow,

643
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,430
man.

644
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,610
How could you just die like that?

645
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:02,850
Wow.

646
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,810
I thought you were a gamer.

647
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:05,270
I'm a ghost.

648
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,290
I'm a ghost.

649
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,650
I can go down below now.

650
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,250
Now you can check.

651
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,210
Wait, there's bees here.

652
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,710
Wouldn't it be funny if there was a village right next to us?

653
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,130
Oh, my God.

654
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,890
Wait, I'm gonna see.

655
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,110
Wait, is there a natural village anywhere near us?

656
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:22,650
Not...

657
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,550
Not that I see.

658
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,830
Okay, so this was a bad spot anyway.

659
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,490
Yeah, it was a waste.

660
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,610
You guys, we need a better seed than us.

661
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

662
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,970
That's why we died.

663
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:31,750
We were like, you know what?

664
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,890
This seed was pretty bad.

665
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,490
New seed.

666
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,270
New seed.

667
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:34,730
New seed.

668
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,910
New seed, new seed.

669
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:45,090
We just keep dying until we get some fucking village and those ender portals next to us.

670
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

671
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,050
Oh, my God.

672
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,450
Someone in my chat was just like, VOD gang, you can skip this stream.

673
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,730
On to the next stream, part two.

674
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,930
We're just going to part two at that point.

675
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,390
All right, restarting the server.

676
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:03,950
All right.

677
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,390
Restarting.

678
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,690
You know, I'm going to put text here.

679
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,310
Wait, how many deaths?

680
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,810
Is that what you're putting?

681
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,410
Yeah.

682
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,150
You're putting how many deaths for each of us, right?

683
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,350
Like, Doki one death, Mint one death.

684
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,210
Yeah.

685
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,070
But my death was caused by you, so...

686
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,530
I guess it was Doki two deaths, honestly.

687
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,690
Oh, my death was caused by you, so technically it's one death.

688
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,170
I literally dug a hole.

689
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,610
I dug a...

690
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,130
You murdered me in cold blood.

691
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,210
Technically, if you think about it, because my death was caused by you.

692
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,550
What are you talking about?

693
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,350
That is the ultimate cope I've ever heard of in my entire life.

694
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,830
Oh, yeah?

695
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,950
Says the person that was like, hit me, see if I die.

696
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,130
Who said that?

697
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,190
Who said that?

698
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,450
I didn't think you'd actually do it.

699
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,290
What do you mean?

700
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,570
You said hit you, so I was like, all right, okay.

701
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,790
Yeah, but like, you were really aggressive.

702
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,450
If Mint says jump, I jump.

703
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,570
If Mint says...

704
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,810
If she tells me to jump off the cliff, I'll jump off the cliff.

705
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,690
If she tells me to hit her, I'll hit her until she dies.

706
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,090
Are we good?

707
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:19,690
Is it?

708
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,950
Yeah, we're good.

709
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,670
Oh, another similar one.

710
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,890
All right, I need some logs.

711
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,050
Now I understand why it took them 20 days.

712
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,050
Now I...

713
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,510
Wait, I see...

714
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,690
I see a plains, a savanna.

715
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,310
That's a good place to find a village.

716
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,510
A village?

717
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,970
Oh, we can have a desert village.

718
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,530
Okay, I'm grabbing some wood again.

719
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,290
I'm not, I'm going.

720
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,730
How many times will I have to grab wood for us?

721
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,030
For us?

722
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,390
For yourself?

723
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,530
This is a team game.

724
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,430
I am playing Minecraft 2.

725
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:54,910
Okay.

726
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,570
Where are you?

727
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,830
Oh my god, there's a baby horse.

728
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,590
Wait, where did that sheep go?

729
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,070
Did I not see it?

730
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,950
Where is the savanna?

731
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,370
Over here.

732
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,690
Where's over here?

733
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,790
Use your eyes.

734
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,670
I am literally using my eyes.

735
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,370
I'm climbing up a fucking mountain right now.

736
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,090
Why are you climbing?

737
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,210
That's the opposite direction.

738
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,510
Oh, you could have said that.

739
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,990
You could have actually said that.

740
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,230
I have eyes, so I was able to see it.

741
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:17,730
That's why...

742
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,350
Well, clearly we weren't spotted in the same... Oh, I see the savanna.

743
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,290
Okay, you know how I saw the savanna?

744
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,670
I climbed the mountain.

745
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,730
Yeah, but I didn't have to climb a mountain because I have better eyes than you.

746
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:37,170
Well, clearly you spawned in a better location where you could see the savanna because I spawned in a tree where it was covered up by all the other trees.

747
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,430
I spawned in a tree too.

748
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,210
We have equal rights.

749
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,150
I don't think so.

750
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,750
I live in Canada.

751
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,170
In Minecraft, everyone is equal... except the server mod.

752
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:07,930
Let me get some food for us.

753
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,270
Yeah, I'm killing sheep.

754
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,310
Me too.

755
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,750
I'm killing sheep and pigs.

756
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:13,270
And pigs.

757
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,110
I just killed a pig.

758
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,750
I'm about to kill a pig.

759
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,270
I'm about to kill a pig.

760
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,150
Oh, there, I killed a pig.

761
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,870
I see you.

762
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,770
I see you.

763
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,170
That's gonna yoink your crafting table.

764
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,170
No, you won't.

765
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,490
Okay, usually there's villages in this area.

766
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,250
Yeah, I'm killing the sheep now.

767
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,730
I mean, what good does this mean?

768
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,890
We can't cook it.

769
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,090
We're literally... I mean, we can literally burn trees for that.

770
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,070
That's the whole point.

771
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:48,710
Mr. Beast is now controversial, so we have to burn all the trees that he planted.

772
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,490
Take back what once he planted.

773
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,370
Take it all back.

774
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,390
Take it all back.

775
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,590
Take it all back.

776
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,110
Oh, I see another portal, actually.

777
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,970
Oh, shit, you see another portal?

778
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,190
Yeah, I'm really good at seeing things.

779
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,530
I'm pretty sure you just have, like, better... Oh, there's chickens.

780
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,590
I literally even told you my FOV.

781
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,190
There's so many chickens.

782
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,030
She asked for my FOV, guys, and I was like, yes.

783
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,170
You guys wanna know what her FOV was?

784
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,790
You guys wanna know?

785
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:25,990
What?

786
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,010
It was at 75, and that's default.

787
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,010
Is it default?

788
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,790
Yeah, that's default.

789
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,690
Oh, well, that's good.

790
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,410
What is yours at?

791
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,310
No, it's not.

792
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,230
I'm at 85.

793
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,890
I was, like, wondering... I was wondering if I should do it higher or not.

794
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,150
Look, my chat was like, damn, lol.

795
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,950
Wait, does mine look bad?

796
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,830
Guys, what does your chat say about your FOV?

797
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,370
Oh, is mine bad?

798
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,290
90 minimum?

799
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,830
I think I used to have it at that.

800
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,730
I think you just forgot to change it.

801
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,230
I think I forgot to change it when I... Yeah, when you re-bought Minecraft.

802
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:58,670
Yeah.

803
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,110
Oh, I found an armadillo.

804
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,890
Wait, is this copper?

805
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:02,910
Yeah, that's copper.

806
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,030
Sorry, guys.

807
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,890
Why didn't you say anything?

808
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,770
That's my chat's fault for not saying that it looked gross.

809
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,710
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,430
It's your chat's fault.

811
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,790
You're gonna blame your chat?

812
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:12,550
Yeah.

813
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,970
Of course I would.

814
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,210
That's fucked.

815
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,430
I would never drag goons.

816
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,550
I would never blame you guys.

817
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,430
Uh-oh, there might not be a village here.

818
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,270
Okay, I'm making... Oh, wait, this is not it.

819
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,770
I'm gonna make some sticks.

820
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm making progress.

821
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,790
You're making sticks and I'm making progress.

822
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,990
Come on, Doki, we are not the same.

823
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,490
Oh, yeah, what are you doing?

824
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,050
What are you doing?

825
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:33,690
What are you doing?

826
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,830
I'm searching.

827
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,750
I found a village.

828
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,410
I literally just found a village.

829
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,130
Oh, please.

830
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,070
Enlighten me.

831
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,430
I'm stuck in a cave.

832
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,150
Oh, really?

833
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,030
I thought you found a village.

834
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,410
I did.

835
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,450
Okay, I'm good now.

836
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,550
Alright.

837
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,310
I'm not excited.

838
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,550
Look at that.

839
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,670
I made an advancement.

840
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,570
Have you made an advancement?

841
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,430
Okay, caveman.

842
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,890
You're literally the one in the cave.

843
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,210
I have a bed now.

844
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,190
What do you have?

845
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,270
What are beds for?

846
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,030
Sleeping.

847
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,290
You can't respond.

848
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,330
It's the day.

849
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,190
We can sleep through the night.

850
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,590
I accidentally... I lost my stuff because I forgot.

851
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:16,470
If you mine copper and iron with a wooden pickaxe, you don't get anything.

852
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,230
Are you bragging?

853
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,690
I don't know what you're doing.

854
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,970
No, I'm blaming you for my shortcomings.

855
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,350
Okay, this village actually kind of sucks.

856
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,090
Okay, now I can craft.

857
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,530
Now I got copper.

858
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,490
Why are all the doors open?

859
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,230
This is weird.

860
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,430
Maybe they can open their own doors.

861
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,770
No, they don't do that.

862
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,150
Yes, they do.

863
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,990
They have their own free will.

864
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,190
Are you trying to say the villagers don't have rights?

865
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,550
Yeah.

866
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,770
I need better food.

867
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,690
Oh wait, I have an apple.

868
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,610
I like how you don't even tell me where the village is.

869
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,630
You just left.

870
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,890
Oh yeah, the hay bales.

871
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,910
Yeah, for food.

872
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,610
Yeah, because I told you I made progress.

873
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,810
Yeah, but this is literally a team game.

874
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,870
We have to make progress to get there.

875
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,470
I can't tell anymore.

876
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,350
What do you mean?

877
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,910
We're trying to work together to get to the fucking... What's that?

878
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,170
Oh, I saw the armadillo you found earlier.

879
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,050
Yeah, they're cute.

880
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,050
They're a worthless piece of shit.

881
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:31,670
What do you mean?

882
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,330
Why are you being mean to them?

883
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,530
What can you do with an armadillo?

884
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,630
You can make dog armor.

885
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,470
Yeah, the dog is still gonna die.

886
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,690
No he's not if he has the armor.

887
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,870
Oh wow, there's also a jungle over there.

888
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,230
I passed your armadillo, but I still don't see you.

889
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,330
Just keep going.

890
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,870
It's pretty far actually.

891
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,190
Oh, I see the village.

892
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,810
I see it.

893
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,050
Oh, my food galore.

894
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,530
There's so many pigs.

895
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,690
There's so many of them.

896
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,030
Alright,

897
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,190
nice.

898
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,470
Well, this village is not great, just because it doesn't have like a...

899
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,130
Fine, I'm just trying to get meat right now.

900
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:31,790
It doesn't have any stuff like the wood... the stonesmith people.

901
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,450
I'm just gonna grab some wood.

902
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,090
Wait, why do I need stairs for?

903
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,570
I'm just gonna grab wood.

904
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,350
I'm gonna destroy this home.

905
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,210
Where are you?

906
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,530
I'm destroying this one man's house.

907
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,850
He'll never be safe again.

908
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,430
I'm grabbing... I'm stealing their food supply.

909
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,290
This village is literally gonna die out.

910
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,530
Nice.

911
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,670
They deserve it.

912
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,250
Why would you build a village here?

913
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,210
Yeah, this is a terrible location.

914
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,930
Do I flint?

915
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,710
No, I don't.

916
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,850
That was my previous life.

917
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:04,890
Oh, you do?

918
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,950
I have flint and steel.

919
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,710
You know what to do.

920
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,950
For some reason, I feel like we've done this before.

921
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,670
Death to the village!

922
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,030
Death to the village!

923
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,490
Raid the village!

924
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,190
Raid it!

925
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,670
Oh, shit!

926
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,130
I thought it was me inside!

927
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,250
Oh my god, you fucked me up.

928
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:29,850
I'm gonna die.

929
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,010
I'm actually gonna die, you fucking whore.

930
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,430
Oh my god, I almost died too.

931
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,910
Here, I'll give you some.

932
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,790
Here, here's some bread.

933
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,930
I can't even get up.

934
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,250
I can't even...

935
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,830
Use the pickaxe you made!

936
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,370
I can't even... I can't even get out.

937
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,630
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

938
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,570
Dig this part.

939
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,730
I just need you to dig...

940
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,670
There you go.

941
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,610
Okay, nice.

942
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,510
You know, you could just...

943
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,430
I don't have any tools.

944
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,670
I don't have any tools.

945
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,690
Oh my god.

946
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,850
Alright, let me fuck you up.

947
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,630
Let me grab some trees and build a furnace real quick.

948
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,910
You can just sleep, it's fine.

949
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,930
What do you mean I can just sleep?

950
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,390
Sleeping doesn't do anything regarding health.

951
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,370
It doesn't... Oh, I thought I gave you food.

952
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,110
Hold on, come here.

953
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,070
Do you have bread?

954
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,090
You can make your own bread, okay?

955
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,170
Oh, wow.

956
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,310
Wow, how fortunate of me.

957
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,090
I gave you half of what I have.

958
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,590
How fortunate that I was given the privilege...

959
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,390
Alright, time to go to sleep.

960
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,870
...to make my own bread.

961
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,890
Time to go to sleep.

962
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,330
Sleep, donkey, so we don't die.

963
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,250
Alright, okay, I'm sleeping.

964
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:52,390
Yeah.

965
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,290
I'm sleeping now.

966
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,130
Alright, nice.

967
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:57,910
Nice.

968
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,830
Alright, let me make my bread.

969
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,230
Good morning, Minto.

970
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,750
My... Okay, there you go.

971
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,970
I got 64 bread, let's go.

972
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,910
Wow, see?

973
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,310
It's still burning.

974
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,750
How do you make the bread?

975
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,850
Wait, there's more hay here.

976
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,290
You didn't finish farming all of this.

977
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,210
Oh, whoops.

978
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,330
Oh, it's my bread now.

979
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,430
Yeah, it's your bread now.

980
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,030
Alright, nice.

981
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,470
Okay, we can't die.

982
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,690
This is actually a good run.

983
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,550
We can't die now.

984
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,610
Is it a good run?

985
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,870
This counts as a good run?

986
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,290
Yeah, we have all the bread in the world.

987
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,370
We can't die now.

988
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,290
Food was like the one thing I was most afraid of, so...

989
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,330
So now that we have all the food in the world...

990
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,930
We should be good now.

991
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:46,910
Okay.

992
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,770
Alright, I'm ready.

993
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,010
I'm ready to find a cave.

994
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,610
I have so much food.

995
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,030
Dig down.

996
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:53,810
Alright, fine.

997
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,370
I'll dig down.

998
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:54,890
Yeah.

999
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:55,850
Where are you?

1000
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,870
We're gonna dig down together.

1001
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,610
We are?

1002
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:58,530
Yeah.

1003
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,710
You said you were going to go explore, and I am the bread winner.

1004
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,290
When did I say explore?

1005
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,730
Why did I say those exact words?

1006
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,830
I am the one who does everything above ground, and you do everything below ground.

1007
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,330
You know it'd be faster if we both did stuff together, right?

1008
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,290
You know that would be faster, right?

1009
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,250
We could protect each other from dying.

1010
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,650
Alright, here, let's sit down.

1011
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,470
Wait, where are you?

1012
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,110
I'm right behind you.

1013
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:28,790
Oh, hello.

1014
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,670
I need stone.

1015
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,950
Let me get some stone.

1016
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,750
Let me... not murder, sorry.

1017
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,310
Alright, while you do that, I'm gonna get some cough drops real quick.

1018
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:36,870
I'll be right back.

1019
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,410
Are you good?

1020
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,130
She's coughing, guys.

1021
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,430
Coughing baby.

1022
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,710
She's like a freaking coughing baby.

1023
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,990
Don't steal this.

1024
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,290
What the fuck?

1025
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,470
I can't believe she stole that from me.

1026
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,150
Wait, I'm literally... she's literally AFK and she's still stealing from me.

1027
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,970
This is messed up.

1028
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,800
How is that possible?

1029
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,280
I'm back.

1030
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,700
What were you doing?

1031
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,360
Why were you saying it was messed up?

1032
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,380
I'm stealing the stone from the people.

1033
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,000
It's messed up.

1034
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,460
First time?

1035
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:13,640
No.

1036
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,900
It's still messed up though.

1037
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,500
I'm a criminal.

1038
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,620
You literally burned somebody's house down.

1039
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,200
I'm a criminal.

1040
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,160
And this is your lie.

1041
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,000
This is your lie?

1042
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,320
You burned someone's house down and this is your lie?

1043
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,120
Yeah.

1044
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,380
You cared about like somebody's stone.

1045
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,380
I'm having a change of heart.

1046
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,320
I'm literally having like a... what's it called?

1047
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:40,720
Are you changing?

1048
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,600
What's that movie where that guy goes through the Christmas ghosts?

1049
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,880
Oh my gosh.

1050
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,580
A Christmas story?

1051
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,480
A Christmas story.

1052
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,660
Yeah, it's happening to me.

1053
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,580
Yeah, but these are Scrooge and like the villagers are Little Timmy.

1054
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,240
Yeah, the ghosts of Christmas past, present, future are all coming to me.

1055
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,540
They're saying you're stealing the stone and Little Timmy's not gonna make it for Christmas.

1056
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,820
Oh, it's a Christmas carol.

1057
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,660
You were wrong.

1058
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,900
You didn't even correct me.

1059
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,220
You're like, yeah, it's that.

1060
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,500
Well, Christmas people need to be more original then because...

1061
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,820
Oh, but Christmas, so like...

1062
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,520
Yeah, it's basically the same.

1063
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,460
Yeah, it's literally the same thing.

1064
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Can I make anything out of the mossy bricks?

1065
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,940
A Christmas story is the one with the leg lamp.

1066
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,320
What the fuck is... what?

1067
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,820
The what?

1068
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,500
Someone was like, that's the leg lamp.

1069
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,840
I'm like, what the fuck does that mean?

1070
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,940
A lick lamp?

1071
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,700
Leg, they said leg.

1072
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,540
Ligma?

1073
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,980
What is that?

1074
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,060
Someone was like, why don't you have a mini map mod?

1075
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,440
I was like, I'm not making this game easy.

1076
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,220
Oh, what are you talking about?

1077
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,920
We're gaming.

1078
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,220
Yeah, we're gaming.

1079
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,380
Alright, I'm ready.

1080
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,140
Are you ready now?

1081
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,980
Yeah, probably.

1082
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,240
Alright, let's go.

1083
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,100
I'm gonna actually cut the... get more wood just in case something happens to us.

1084
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,640
I wanna go see the jungle.

1085
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,680
That's not part of the plan, Mint.

1086
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,540
The jungle has nothing to do with the Ender Dragon.

1087
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,300
But what if there's pandas?

1088
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,840
The jungle has nothing to do with the Ender... Dig, it's time to dig.

1089
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,180
You know your place.

1090
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,060
Okay, we're digging for real though, right?

1091
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,980
Yeah, yeah, for real this time.

1092
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,540
But we have to... I think we have to find a way to... we have to dig in like a ladder.

1093
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,540
Or like a staircase.

1094
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,160
We have to come back out.

1095
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,360
We can just... we need to explore.

1096
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,880
We're not gonna go back to the same area.

1097
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,960
We get our stuff and then fucking dig up.

1098
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,100
Oh, typical Mint.

1099
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,620
Letting me do all the work.

1100
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,780
Hold on, I don't have a shovel.

1101
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,100
If I drop, will I die?

1102
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,740
We don't need a shovel.

1103
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,600
No, we don't.

1104
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,400
Just jump down.

1105
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,100
Alright, let's go.

1106
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,640
You dig mine and I'll dig yours.

1107
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,840
Alright.

1108
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,780
We're so efficient.

1109
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,800
We're so efficient.

1110
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,460
This is teamwork.

1111
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,280
This is real teamwork, guys.

1112
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,960
Digging our own hole is a lot faster than what we're doing.

1113
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,400
Oh, hold on.

1114
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,360
Mine just broke.

1115
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
Do you have another one?

1116
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,820
Here, put your crafting table here.

1117
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,220
Okay, thank you.

1118
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,800
Wow, it feels like...

1119
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,160
Oh, hey, coal.

1120
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,580
Nice.

1121
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,900
Oh, nice, nice.

1122
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,460
We got coal.

1123
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,000
Okay, we got coal now.

1124
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,660
Oh my god, this is a lot of coal.

1125
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,320
Nice, you have a... Oh, hey, what about digging my hole?

1126
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm sorry.

1127
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,580
Coal is just much more important.

1128
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,280
I'm still digging coal out right now.

1129
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,060
Okay, I'm digging coal.

1130
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,840
I'm digging coal.

1131
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,680
We're digging coal.

1132
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,020
We're digging coal.

1133
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,940
We're making progress.

1134
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,240
Alright, hole time.

1135
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,040
Oh, wait, we're sick.

1136
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,860
Oh, never mind.

1137
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,580
Why is yours a little faster than mine?

1138
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,660
I don't know.

1139
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,200
Maybe I'm just more efficient than you.

1140
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,620
It's because I'm like...

1141
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,500
Oh, it's because I'm clicking it.

1142
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm clicking it instead of holding.

1143
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,960
Yeah, I'm still...

1144
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,140
Oh, there we go.

1145
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,780
Oh, come on.

1146
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,380
Come on.

1147
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,000
Dig me.

1148
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,560
That's... That's the... What's it called?

1149
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,660
That's copy.

1150
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,580
Alright.

1151
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,780
Hey, don't hop.

1152
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,140
Oh yeah, what's going on?

1153
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,780
Oh, we're synced up again.

1154
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,120
Where's our cave?

1155
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,940
Where's our cave?

1156
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,640
Where the fuck is our cave?

1157
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,480
There has to be at least one cave.

1158
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,060
I hear a zombie.

1159
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,360
Oh, we could get the diamond.

1160
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,300
I think we might be close to that.

1161
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,500
Oh, I hear a zombie to our left.

1162
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,620
Yeah, maybe we should dig left.

1163
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,300
Our left?

1164
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,220
Wait, that's our right?

1165
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,420
Are your earbuds on?

1166
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,640
No, I think your earbuds is wrong.

1167
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,660
This is left.

1168
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,880
Kill him!

1169
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:51,940
Kill him!

1170
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,920
Where is he?

1171
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,100
Oh my god, I can't even tell.

1172
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,500
Oh my god, I might die.

1173
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:55,860
I might die.

1174
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,440
You gotta kill him.

1175
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:56,940
I might die.

1176
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,560
I actually might die.

1177
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,860
You have to kill him.

1178
00:44:59,080 --> 00:44:59,540
You have to!

1179
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,000
I blame you.

1180
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,240
What do you mean you blame me?

1181
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,960
You did not get him!

1182
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,780
I was literally fighting him.

1183
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,880
You were in front of me.

1184
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,560
If I hit him, I would have killed you.

1185
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,300
No, I didn't.

1186
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,800
You were literally on top of me.

1187
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,120
I would have attacked you and you would have died faster.

1188
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,700
You literally had a chance to fucking hit...

1189
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,740
I saw you hesitate.

1190
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,060
I did it!

1191
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,040
I was attacking!

1192
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,180
You looked at him before you attacked him.

1193
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,560
I was attacking him.

1194
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,860
That was your fault.

1195
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,820
I'm blaming that on you.

1196
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,380
That's a mid-death number three.

1197
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,060
Wait, are you saying mid-death number three?

1198
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,540
Why am I at three?

1199
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,300
You know why.

1200
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,740
Doki two.

1201
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,800
Doki is coping.

1202
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,240
Baby cough.

1203
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,840
Baby cough is getting to her brain.

1204
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,260
You go first.

1205
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,500
When we are at a cave, you go first.

1206
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,680
What are you talking about?

1207
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,380
You go first.

1208
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,840
You were the one who dug for the zombie.

1209
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,340
We didn't even have any iron for a shield.

1210
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,920
It's all on you.

1211
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,660
It's all on you.

1212
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,200
How is that on me?

1213
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,840
I went first.

1214
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,520
And I was like, alright, there's the cave.

1215
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,300
I could hear it because I was like, oh, turn left.

1216
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,640
There's a cave on the left side.

1217
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,020
And I dug the cave hole for us.

1218
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,220
And then, I went to explore first.

1219
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,120
I went to brave the wild for you.

1220
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,200
All I hear is...

1221
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,200
Okay, anyway.

1222
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,360
You log in now.

1223
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:54,820
Oh, okay.

1224
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,020
This is good.

1225
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,260
This is a good biome.

1226
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,080
Alright, time to hit the trees again.

1227
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,020
Hit the trees.

1228
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,080
Hit the trees.

1229
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,660
Hit the trees.

1230
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,660
We got this.

1231
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,500
Okay.

1232
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,760
What if we get a shield before we dig down?

1233
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,940
How does that sound?

1234
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,680
That sounds like a better idea.

1235
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,500
Why didn't you come up with the idea earlier?

1236
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,960
I, you know...

1237
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,240
My genius hits me in funny ways.

1238
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,280
Did chat tell you that?

1239
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,860
No, I knew that because I watched the video on how to prepare for...

1240
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,640
How to prepare for Minecraft ArcCorp.

1241
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,280
Oh, so you cheated.

1242
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,220
No, I did research.

1243
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,040
How is research cheating?

1244
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,560
So you researched...

1245
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,960
Oh, no, it is cheating.

1246
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,580
You're trying to find the most optimal route instead of letting it happen.

1247
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,640
No, because I still have to do it all on my own.

1248
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,760
It's still my own skill work.

1249
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,020
Yeah, miss...

1250
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,440
Let's go to the jungle.

1251
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,400
Yeah, the jungle probably wouldn't have killed us like you did.

1252
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,100
Hey, did the video tell you to go to the jungle?

1253
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,680
Did it tell you to go to the jungle with the most optimal route?

1254
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,960
The jungle probably has really great secrets.

1255
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,460
I'm just saying.

1256
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:05,940
Like what?

1257
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,600
I don't know.

1258
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,380
I don't know their secrets.

1259
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,840
We could've gotten to see them.

1260
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,220
You watch the video.

1261
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,300
The video is not gonna tell us everything.

1262
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,480
The video does not hold your hand.

1263
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,860
Then what the point was the video for?

1264
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,100
It's a video guide.

1265
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,360
Oh, there you are.

1266
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,780
I see you.

1267
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,440
This is the first time I saw a cow.

1268
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,760
I'm seeing sheep.

1269
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,560
Eat up this cow.

1270
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,480
With my hands.

1271
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,960
I'm so tired of chopping trees.

1272
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,420
It's Minecraft.

1273
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,020
It's literally Minecraft.

1274
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,180
Just get used to it.

1275
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,860
This is literally what you do in Minecraft.

1276
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,880
I'm so over these fucking trees.

1277
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,360
This was your idea.

1278
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,000
This was your idea.

1279
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,520
It's been 4 minutes.

1280
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,820
Was Min's volume okay so far?

1281
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,940
Okay, I just didn't think that...

1282
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,260
Min would cause me to die so many times.

1283
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,960
Guys, can you believe this?

1284
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,720
Do you hear this?

1285
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,060
This coping is absolutely ridiculous.

1286
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,500
I think...

1287
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
The fall really did her in.

1288
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,640
She's just...

1289
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,460
Oh, I just killed the sheep's...

1290
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,340
I just killed the sheep's mom right in front of him.

1291
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,040
Oh my god.

1292
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:20,440
Alright.

1293
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,120
The little baby sheep just ran up to his dead mom.

1294
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,960
It's so sad.

1295
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,600
Oh my god, it's like a Disney movie right there.

1296
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,300
I know, I just caused...

1297
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,460
I just made The Lion King.

1298
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,620
You're welcome, everybody.

1299
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,140
Oh, The Lion King?

1300
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,180
Yeah, because that's a better movie.

1301
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,520
Are you trying to say Bambi is not a good movie?

1302
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,620
I'm just saying...

1303
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,640
Can we agree that The Lion King is a better movie than Bambi?

1304
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,520
I guess if you're a furry...

1305
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,880
Yeah, Min?

1306
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,480
Um...

1307
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,680
That's your opinion.

1308
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,560
That's your opinion.

1309
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,260
That's a certified Doki Bird opinion.

1310
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,240
I wonder if there's any villages.

1311
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,840
I'm searching.

1312
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,720
I'm getting...

1313
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,600
Alright, there has to be another village, right?

1314
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,100
Usually this biome is good about having a village.

1315
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,020
Yeah.

1316
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,140
Oh my gosh, you know about all that too?

1317
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:24,920
Yeah.

1318
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,640
I played a lot of Minecraft.

1319
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,840
Wow, she's a gamer.

1320
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,420
Yeah, she played a lot.

1321
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,420
Oh my gosh.

1322
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,060
Alright.

1323
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,900
I'm killing more pigs.

1324
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,560
I'm pushing more trees.

1325
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,920
I'm punching so many trees.

1326
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,840
Just punch them.

1327
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,280
Alright, I'm gonna look for a village too.

1328
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,540
I'm running out of...

1329
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,540
We need to get food soon too.

1330
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,140
I know.

1331
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,740
Well, I have some raw meat.

1332
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,360
Yeah, I do too.

1333
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,160
But I think I'd rather just find a village and like...

1334
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,280
Steal their food and pillage them?

1335
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,020
Yeah, just steal their food and pillage them.

1336
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,600
It's just, why do our own work when we can rob others of their work?

1337
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,840
They already did the hard work.

1338
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,840
Yeah, exactly.

1339
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,380
That's what pillaging is for.

1340
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,920
Yeah, for people like us.

1341
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,180
Look at the vikings.

1342
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,280
There's some coal here.

1343
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,360
I think I can grab it.

1344
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,120
I mean, the vikings knew what's up.

1345
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,440
Let's just ignore all the other bad stuff they've done.

1346
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,340
But other than that, they thrived.

1347
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,200
They had the right idea, I think.

1348
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,800
They had the right idea.

1349
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,020
Yeah, exactly.

1350
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,160
Oh, I'm advancing.

1351
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,600
Hmm, what are you doing?

1352
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
Are you sure there's...

1353
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,540
I'm fucking trying to find a village?

1354
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,680
So am I, and I found other things along the way.

1355
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,360
And you dug a fucking rock.

1356
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,220
Congratulations.

1357
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,700
I got coal for us so we could cook our meal.

1358
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,640
I mean, we have trees.

1359
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:48,960
So?

1360
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,280
Oh, shoot, there's more.

1361
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,040
Trees do the same thing.

1362
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,300
With less resources.

1363
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,500
No, it's actually more resources.

1364
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,820
With less effort getting the resources.

1365
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,840
We're at the end of the...

1366
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,120
There's a really big cave here.

1367
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,680
Oh, shoot.

1368
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,400
Oh my god.

1369
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,600
It's okay, you'll be fine.

1370
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,380
I am trying to find a village.

1371
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,420
I don't think I'm gonna be fine.

1372
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:08,940
Oh shit.

1373
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,000
Okay, Mint, just die now so we can restart.

1374
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,040
All I wanted was the coal.

1375
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,280
Oh gosh.

1376
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,620
Oh my god.

1377
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:22,640
I will know she lives or not while I try to find a village here.

1378
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,680
I think I'm good.

1379
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,100
Okay, good.

1380
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,740
I'm far far.

1381
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,240
What is far far?

1382
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,360
I kept going forward.

1383
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,580
You went into the cave, I went forward.

1384
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,400
Wait, did you see me go into the cave?

1385
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:37,600
No.

1386
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,860
Then how do you know where I am?

1387
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,680
Because I saw you and then you disappeared.

1388
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,920
So I assumed...

1389
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,560
I assumed something happened to you.

1390
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,620
I'm almost out of food.

1391
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,120
Or out of... Wait.

1392
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,260
Okay, I'm gonna have to eat the raw beef.

1393
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,780
Eat it.

1394
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,540
Just cook the raw beef.

1395
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,480
You have the coal.

1396
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,380
We don't...

1397
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,180
Where is the... Oh, you're right.

1398
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,600
You have... What do you mean?

1399
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,740
You literally advanced the stone age.

1400
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,320
What do you mean?

1401
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,980
Oh my god.

1402
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,220
I think I'm the luckiest gamer ever.

1403
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:11,900
Oh my god.

1404
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,440
Wait, why are we at Terracotta?

1405
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,120
Where?

1406
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,920
It's Terracotta.

1407
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,080
Wait, no.

1408
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,260
What is this yellow sand?

1409
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,180
Red sand?

1410
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,140
Yeah, it's Terracotta sand.

1411
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:20,800
Yeah.

1412
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,960
Why is there fucking Terracotta?

1413
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,060
I don't know.

1414
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,140
That's where we spawned.

1415
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,100
Or Mesa.

1416
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,640
Or the Mesa biome.

1417
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,060
Not ideal.

1418
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,400
Not ideal.

1419
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,040
Because I'm here for the fucking village.

1420
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,940
Bad spawn.

1421
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,000
Bad seed.

1422
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:40,820
Hate this seed.

1423
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,960
If only somebody didn't fucking protect me from the baby zombie.

1424
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,760
Did you say didn't protect you?

1425
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,060
If only someone did not protect me.

1426
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,680
Oh yeah, sorry.

1427
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,220
I mean somebody did protect me from the baby...

1428
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,320
I'm very delusional.

1429
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,800
It's been like an hour already.

1430
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,280
I'm already done.

1431
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,780
We haven't made...

1432
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,540
We've made zero progress.

1433
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,440
We haven't even...

1434
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,700
We can't get past to the...

1435
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,320
To the...

1436
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,500
To the cave section yet.

1437
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,180
Bro, the seed fucking...

1438
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,360
Where is the village?

1439
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,140
I don't know.

1440
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,320
It's okay.

1441
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:19,980
I found...

1442
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,320
I found like a corrupted nether portal.

1443
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,760
At least we got that.

1444
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,640
That's good.

1445
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,160
We're gonna die.

1446
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,300
The sun's gonna go down.

1447
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,600
We're gonna die for real.

1448
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,060
You mean we're gonna die.

1449
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,640
Oh, okay.

1450
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,680
Actually, I am gonna build my furnace.

1451
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,920
And I'm gonna have real food.

1452
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,700
I don't...

1453
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,480
It's not even... The sun is still up.

1454
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,920
Nevermind, I don't have enough stone.

1455
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,200
Okay, I found a...

1456
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,300
There's stone all around you!

1457
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,580
Where are you?

1458
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,240
How do you know there's stone all around me?

1459
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,980
I thought you said you dropped into a cave.

1460
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,140
No, I've got out of there.

1461
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,700
I've been searching for a village.

1462
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,360
Oh my god, at least I got golden carrots.

1463
00:54:59,020 --> 00:54:59,800
How the hell?

1464
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,140
Oh, from the...

1465
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,720
The corrupted portal, yeah.

1466
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,460
Oh my god.

1467
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,260
Got my food.

1468
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,980
I'm gonna create my house in here.

1469
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:09,700
Maybe.

1470
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,700
Okay, furnace time.

1471
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,480
Furnace time.

1472
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,720
Is that your new house?

1473
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,820
Is this where you're gonna live now?

1474
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:19,600
Yeah.

1475
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,340
Why do you act like you know where I am?

1476
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
It's freaking me out.

1477
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,040
I mean, I can see you.

1478
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:24,860
Where?

1479
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:27,460
Where?

1480
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,860
Yeah, I can see you right now.

1481
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:29,980
Where?

1482
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,760
What am I doing?

1483
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,080
You're freaking trying to make a furnace.

1484
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,040
No, I made the furnace.

1485
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,260
You can't see me.

1486
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,000
You're full of shit.

1487
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,040
No, I saw you make that furnace.

1488
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,260
No, you didn't.

1489
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,160
Yes, I did.

1490
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,160
Okay, what am I doing right now?

1491
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,500
Right now?

1492
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah.

1493
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,000
You're just walking around.

1494
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,900
No, I'm not.

1495
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,460
You're so full of shit.

1496
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,600
You're so full of shit.

1497
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,040
You got paranoid for a second.

1498
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:58,980
You got paranoid.

1499
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,820
Yeah, but you are just a liar.

1500
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,880
You can't gaslight me for too long.

1501
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,920
I call you out.

1502
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,100
What are you doing then?

1503
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,320
I'm making food.

1504
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,680
And I'm preparing for the night.

1505
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,380
Oh, it's going down.

1506
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:18,880
Yeah.

1507
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,940
Yeah, it's going really way down.

1508
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,520
It's going way down.

1509
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,820
Oh, this is a little bad.

1510
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,560
What do you mean one of us?

1511
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,700
What are you doing?

1512
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,220
I'm digging.

1513
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,400
I'm making a little home.

1514
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,840
What are you doing?

1515
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm doing the same thing.

1516
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,480
Uh-huh.

1517
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,940
I doubt it for some reason.

1518
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,780
It's because I'm in the water.

1519
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,120
Now I'm doing the same thing.

1520
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,600
I'm just going to spend the night in the hole.

1521
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,620
Is that what...

1522
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,400
I don't want to.

1523
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,900
I think I can make a bed because I got some...

1524
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,360
Wait, let's see.

1525
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:55,760
Bed.

1526
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,300
I can make a bed.

1527
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,540
How many do you need for a bed?

1528
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:00,280
I forgot.

1529
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,560
Three wool.

1530
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,900
Okay, let's see if I can do this in time before they come in.

1531
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,940
I'm asleep.

1532
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,180
I'm ready for bed.

1533
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,900
Okay, I'm asleep too.

1534
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,260
Okay, nice.

1535
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,700
Before the zombies get here, do it before the zombies come up.

1536
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,180
I'm asleep.

1537
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,220
Okay, thank God.

1538
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,040
Everything is fine, guys.

1539
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,700
Everything is fine.

1540
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,820
We know what we're doing.

1541
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,160
Yeah, duh.

1542
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,980
One of us knows what we're doing.

1543
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,660
Guess which one it is.

1544
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,720
I made a bed first.

1545
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,460
But your initial plan was to dig a fucking hole.

1546
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:40,960
Like that.

1547
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,160
I made a hole in the mountain.

1548
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,520
In the side of the mountain.

1549
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,360
What are you talking about?

1550
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,080
What are we gonna do there?

1551
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,460
What does it benefit?

1552
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,040
I'm finding coal eventually.

1553
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,440
I already have coal.

1554
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,200
How many?

1555
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,760
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1556
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,760
It literally has a number.

1557
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,080
I'm in front of coal right now.

1558
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,910
You can't just count what's in your inventory?

1559
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,050
Oh my God.

1560
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,570
I'm literally in front of coal right now.

1561
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,930
I gotta be in the stone age so I can farm this.

1562
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:21,550
Oh, shoot.

1563
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,310
We should probably meet up.

1564
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:26,150
Coal.

1565
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:27,370
Whoa.

1566
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,330
Coal.

1567
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,330
Look at all this coal in front of me.

1568
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,110
Wow.

1569
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,950
Guys.

1570
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,490
How do I get out of this?

1571
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,330
Alright, first one to find the village...

1572
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,890
has to tell the coordinates to the other person.

1573
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:42,430
Okay.

1574
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,470
I'm gonna be lazy then.

1575
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,290
I'm not gonna do anything.

1576
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:47,270
Oh yeah?

1577
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,570
You're gonna have to travel to me.

1578
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,390
Yeah, okay.

1579
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:56,570
You'd rather travel?

1580
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,250
What if I...

1581
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,050
I might find it first.

1582
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:02,430
Oh, shit.

1583
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,530
If I find the village first...

1584
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,070
you have to fucking find me...

1585
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,250
and I can just sit on my ass just waiting for you at the village.

1586
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,630
No, you would have to gather everything at the village.

1587
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,950
No, I don't have to.

1588
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:13,470
Yeah, you do.

1589
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,090
This is a team effort.

1590
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,230
Why did you find the village?

1591
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:19,670
What do you mean?

1592
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,470
Is it only my job to find villages, huh?

1593
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,430
Yes, it's a team...

1594
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,070
Oh, what happened?

1595
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:25,890
It's a team game.

1596
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,750
We gotta find the village together.

1597
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,150
Oh, and now you wanna find it together, huh?

1598
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,310
Oh, yeah.

1599
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:34,130
No, I said the first person to find a village...

1600
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,490
gets to mix with the other person and travel all the way there.

1601
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:37,650
Okay.

1602
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,550
Oh my gosh, I found so much coal.

1603
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,150
Me too, I found a lot of coal.

1604
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,110
I've just been mining coal.

1605
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,990
It would be a shame if one of us dies after all this hard coal I just mined.

1606
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,270
We're gonna live, right everybody?

1607
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,110
Oh, shit.

1608
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,030
Oh my god, I almost died.

1609
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,770
What was that sound?

1610
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:56,970
Oh my god.

1611
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:59,470
We're all gonna live, right?

1612
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,170
We're all gonna live.

1613
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:01,710
We're all gonna live.

1614
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,170
We're all gonna live.

1615
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,770
I think if we die...

1616
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,510
Someone... We have to have like a chat sacrifice.

1617
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:13,870
We ban one person?

1618
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,090
We ban a person, yeah.

1619
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,230
For every death.

1620
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,610
You can't unban them though.

1621
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:21,890
Oh, shoot.

1622
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:22,010
Eww.

1623
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,230
Oh, I found some iron.

1624
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,390
Oh my god, please.

1625
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:30,630
My breath meter.

1626
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:31,990
Where am I anymore?

1627
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,230
I don't even know where I am anymore.

1628
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:36,930
I don't even know where I am.

1629
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,730
Oh, I found iron, but it's in the water.

1630
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,030
I'm in the water too.

1631
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:42,550
Hey, come on.

1632
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,530
Come on, you gotta put in the effort.

1633
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,290
I'm gonna mine something that's not in the water.

1634
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:49,370
Did I get it?

1635
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,150
Oh my god, I'm walking backwards now.

1636
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,050
I'm back to the Mesa.

1637
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:54,650
The Mesa biome.

1638
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,810
Where is the Mesa biome anyway?

1639
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:56,710
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

1640
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:59,110
Well, guess you'll never know.

1641
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:04,490
Okay, I made it out with one single iron.

1642
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:05,910
Oh, I found a village.

1643
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:06,750
What, really?

1644
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,750
I don't believe you.

1645
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,610
No, I literally found a village.

1646
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:12,030
I don't believe you.

1647
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,410
I literally see it right... Wait, is that a village?

1648
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,730
Or is that a temple?

1649
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:18,270
Oh, it's a temple.

1650
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:20,330
It's a temple, yeah.

1651
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,290
Oh, wait.

1652
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:25,710
No, well, I mean...

1653
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,690
You can get stuff in there.

1654
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,870
Oh wait, there's like traps there.

1655
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:31,850
Yeah, well, there's...

1656
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:32,110
Okay.

1657
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,470
I wanna... I have to show you how to do it...

1658
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,550
Or else you'll die for real.

1659
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:37,830
Yeah, I think I'm gonna die.

1660
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,610
Oh, you are gonna die?

1661
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:39,910
Okay.

1662
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:41,570
I think I'm gonna die from TNT.

1663
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,250
Well, I guess...

1664
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,690
Good luck trying to find this temple.

1665
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,510
I don't even know where you are.

1666
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:47,390
I'm trying to get a sheep.

1667
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:47,830
Exactly.

1668
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,850
I think I'm far away from you.

1669
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,150
I think you went a different direction than me.

1670
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:53,430
I think so too.

1671
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,210
You never saw the Mesa biome.

1672
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:55,550
No.

1673
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,710
I'm still in the... What's it called biome?

1674
01:01:58,530 --> 01:01:59,570
The what biome?

1675
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,450
The sand?

1676
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:00,850
The desert?

1677
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,650
I never... Wait, there's a desert biome?

1678
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,570
Oh my God, I went too far.

1679
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,150
She found a temple, guys.

1680
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:08,210
She found a temple.

1681
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:08,450
She found a temple.

1682
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:13,970
Wait, you never... Okay, I definitely went too far.

1683
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:15,330
Where did you go?

1684
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,430
I don't know.

1685
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:20,190
I went to a place where there's a desert biome and I never left.

1686
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,690
How do I get around this?

1687
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:24,610
Okay.

1688
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:25,910
Over here.

1689
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,390
This seed sucks.

1690
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,390
Our other seeds were so much better.

1691
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,470
We had actual villages like within seconds.

1692
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:40,750
We had an actual good seed and then Mint fucked it up.

1693
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:41,010
What?

1694
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:41,430
Me?

1695
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:46,790
And then she fucked it up for the rest of...

1696
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,110
Yeah, you!

1697
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,210
Oh, I found a jungle.

1698
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,550
Did you ever find a jungle?

1699
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:53,350
No.

1700
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,370
I found like an above ground mine shaft.

1701
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,830
Oh yeah, you're definitely in the Mesa.

1702
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,630
Don't go in there.

1703
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,050
Don't go in there.

1704
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,150
Don't go in there, Doki.

1705
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:04,170
Doki, I swear.

1706
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,010
Doki, don't go in there.

1707
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,910
I found a real village.

1708
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,950
I found...

1709
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,250
Now I'm actually for real.

1710
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,130
I found a village.

1711
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,770
It's in front of the...

1712
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:17,110
It's in front of the above ground mine shaft.

1713
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,870
Wait, what's the key that you see my spine coordinates?

1714
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:23,450
What?

1715
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,150
The show coordinates.

1716
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:25,810
What is it?

1717
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,050
Alright, I'll give you my coordinates.

1718
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:28,410
Wait.

1719
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,330
Okay, there you go.

1720
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:30,770
But I wanna go in the jungle.

1721
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:31,850
Oh, I got obsidian.

1722
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:32,990
Oh, nice.

1723
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,370
Alright, you gotta come over to me.

1724
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:39,430
You gotta leave that jungle.

1725
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:40,690
A deal's a deal.

1726
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:41,830
You gotta leave.

1727
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:42,870
A deal's a deal.

1728
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,270
No, I just made it in here.

1729
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:45,890
Don't you want chocolate?

1730
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,710
No, I don't want chocolate.

1731
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,390
I wanna fucking kill the ender dragon.

1732
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,010
What if that includes...

1733
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,450
What if that's part of the plan?

1734
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,650
Oh yeah, the two-for-one deal.

1735
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,990
You get chocolate and an ender dragon.

1736
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:57,850
Yeah, exactly.

1737
01:03:58,890 --> 01:03:59,530
Oh, if...

1738
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:02,990
I would be surprised if we would make it to the ender dragon on this seed.

1739
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,490
I think we can do it.

1740
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,230
Alright, get over here.

1741
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:08,610
Get out of the fucking jungle.

1742
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,710
Hold on, and I'm looking around.

1743
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:12,470
Uh-oh, it goes to a dark woods.

1744
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:13,510
Okay, I'm getting out of here.

1745
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:15,470
If you die, like, after I try...

1746
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,530
I've worked so hard getting here, I swear to God.

1747
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,410
Wait, where are you at?

1748
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:21,250
You didn't even send me your coordinates, you idiot.

1749
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,230
My coordinates is...

1750
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,410
Type it in the chat.

1751
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:29,250
X-471.3 I'm not gonna pay attention to this.

1752
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,970
Alright, someone in the chat is gonna type this out.

1753
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:49,250
X-471.336 X-471.336 X -471.336 X -471.336 X-471.336 X-471.336 X -471.336

1754
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:22,990
X -471.336 X-471.336 Aren't you supposed to help as a teammate?

1755
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,070
We have to make shields.

1756
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:27,070
So we gotta get iron.

1757
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:28,110
Okay.

1758
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:32,810
Find iron in the village.

1759
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:34,950
Loot them for all they're worth.

1760
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,870
Wait, what was the coordinates, guys?

1761
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:38,810
What was the coordinates?

1762
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:41,730
Oh, wait.

1763
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:42,790
That's not what I meant to do.

1764
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:46,930
Negative 471.

1765
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:48,670
471?!

1766
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:49,890
Seriously?

1767
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:51,190
Oh my God.

1768
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,070
4411.

1769
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,270
Your chat isn't even typing the right coordinates.

1770
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,090
Negative 411.

1771
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,710
Oh my God, I took a fucking screenshot.

1772
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:04,790
411.

1773
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:07,070
Oh wait, it was 71 because I moved.

1774
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:08,130
Oh my God.

1775
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,210
Oh, and you're calling them dumb!

1776
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,930
Negative 410.744.

1777
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,730
278.330.

1778
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,950
I forgot I can move.

1779
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:23,810
Oh, X is negative?

1780
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:24,790
Oh my God.

1781
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:25,310
Okay, then.

1782
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,910
That's only the first coordinate!

1783
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,750
How did you get confused with the X?

1784
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,370
First thing I read!

1785
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,430
You have a bed, right?

1786
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,290
You have your bed still?

1787
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,350
Yeah, I have several beds.

1788
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:39,690
I'm getting watermelon.

1789
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,230
I'm getting watermelon.

1790
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:43,710
Type in chat, it's easier.

1791
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,870
No, she has to work for it.

1792
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:47,010
Oh, there's a cat here.

1793
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,250
She doesn't want to work as a team, you guys.

1794
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,810
If I die, it's all Doki's fault.

1795
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,150
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1796
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,510
I fucking found the village for us.

1797
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,410
I found the villages before and you blamed me.

1798
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:02,150
So I guess whoever finds the village first is the person who gets the death blamed on them.

1799
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,550
Thank you for not fucking protecting me.

1800
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,790
No, no, no.

1801
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,670
I hope you die in this round.

1802
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:10,110
Why?

1803
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,150
Why?

1804
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:13,170
Why?

1805
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,750
I'm gonna fucking jump off the cliff right now and we're gonna restart this.

1806
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:18,210
No!

1807
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,490
We have to do it!

1808
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:21,310
We have to win with this seed!

1809
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:25,890
You're gonna get to the village and I'm gonna get that cork gun and...

1810
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:28,350
You'll make it a spectacle.

1811
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,830
All the villagers will be watching you like...

1812
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:31,350
No, Doki!

1813
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,070
Don't do it!

1814
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:32,310
No!

1815
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:35,730
Wait, you guys, what was the coordinates again?

1816
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:39,590
What were the coordinates again?

1817
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,950
I got us a ton of hit.

1818
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,650
I'm eating.

1819
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:47,650
I'm having dinner at Twilight.

1820
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,190
471304.

1821
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,070
Oh.

1822
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:53,190
That's not what I wanted to do.

1823
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:56,470
I have so much worthless shit in my inventory.

1824
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,010
Let's sleep.

1825
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:58,630
Can we sleep?

1826
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,310
Sleep.

1827
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:00,150
Sleep.

1828
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,510
Sleep, please, before the zombies come.

1829
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:03,870
Sleep before the zombies come.

1830
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:04,750
Sleep before the zombies come.

1831
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:05,590
You're not asleep!

1832
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:06,430
You're not asleep?

1833
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:07,050
Oh my god!

1834
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,970
Which way was I going?

1835
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:15,190
Maya, I'm working so hard for this group.

1836
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,650
I have so much resources right now in my inventory.

1837
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:19,190
Oh yeah, what?

1838
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:19,810
What do you have?

1839
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:20,330
What do you have?

1840
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:29,930
I have meat, I have lots of stone, I have lots of food, I have lots of coal.

1841
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:31,370
Yeah, do you have iron?

1842
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,610
I have one iron.

1843
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:36,010
Lots of resources.

1844
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,390
Well, how many iron do you have?

1845
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:39,450
I don't need iron.

1846
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,030
Wait, what are you talking about?

1847
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:43,990
I literally was just...

1848
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,350
You wanted to know the secrets and I said, what are the first secrets?

1849
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:48,330
I have a golden pickaxe.

1850
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:49,930
That's a golden pickaxe.

1851
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:50,630
It sucks.

1852
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:51,990
Golden pickaxes suck.

1853
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:54,270
I have a golden... It's literally the same as iron.

1854
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:55,170
No, it's not.

1855
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,870
Golden things are terrible.

1856
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:58,710
It's the same as iron.

1857
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,930
It has the same stats as iron.

1858
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,310
I have a... No, it doesn't.

1859
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:03,330
It breaks sooner.

1860
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,610
Not mine because it has mending on it.

1861
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,370
Okay, you're gonna get experience?

1862
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,630
Okay, I wanna see that happen.

1863
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:18,190
I bet it's gonna last longer than your fucking iron pickaxe.

1864
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,550
It actually will.

1865
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,210
It actually will.

1866
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:29,410
I wanna see you dig down with that thing and be like, oh no, it has mending though.

1867
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,170
It has mending though!

1868
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,770
And then freak out.

1869
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:34,150
It does.

1870
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:38,730
Yeah, the mending doesn't do shit unless you have... Yes, it does.

1871
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:42,870
It doesn't do shit unless you have ways to get an experience bar.

1872
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:43,830
Exactly.

1873
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,510
I'll wait till it's night time.

1874
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:48,990
In the cave, huh?

1875
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:49,750
When you dig down?

1876
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:50,650
Yeah, in the cave.

1877
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,230
Exactly.

1878
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:53,950
Oh my god, where the fuck are you?

1879
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:54,430
Where are you at?

1880
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,810
I'm in the mesa biome.

1881
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:56,870
I'm almost there.

1882
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:58,490
Oh my god.

1883
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:01,630
I'm gonna make sure you get here and then I'm gonna jump off this roof.

1884
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,130
Wait, I think I went too far.

1885
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,390
You were at 400?

1886
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,450
Yeah, negative 410.

1887
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:10,310
But it was like 300.

1888
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:11,390
I think I went too far.

1889
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,090
Oh my god, chill out.

1890
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:19,110
If we had just stuck together as a team, like we were supposed to...

1891
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:20,070
You walked away first!

1892
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:24,510
You gotta say that when you literally walked away first.

1893
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:25,810
You literally...

1894
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:29,530
You started off by walking away from me.

1895
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:33,290
No, I'm just... I get things done.

1896
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:34,570
I'm ready to go.

1897
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:35,590
I'm ready to do things.

1898
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,010
Oh yeah, you get things done?

1899
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:39,110
Where was the village that you found?

1900
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:43,070
I have found two villages so far and you found literally one, okay?

1901
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:44,130
Get off your high horse.

1902
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:46,530
You didn't find that village.

1903
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,690
Yes, I did!

1904
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:52,750
I found all villages so far except this one.

1905
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:54,430
Yeah, the hardest one.

1906
01:10:54,510 --> 01:11:00,610
You got the easy... Yeah, because you wandered off first so of course you'd find the easy villages first.

1907
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:05,950
That's like, you know, when you kill a level 1 player, you basically did like a level 1 strat.

1908
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:09,110
And I was doing a level 30 area.

1909
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,830
Oh yeah, yeah.

1910
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:13,710
Who told you that this biome would have a village?

1911
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:14,430
Yeah, me.

1912
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,690
Oh, every biome has a village.

1913
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:17,750
Except for snow.

1914
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,570
That's actually... No, actually, no.

1915
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:19,970
Snow does.

1916
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:20,590
Nevermind.

1917
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:24,150
Every biome has a village.

1918
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:27,310
Yeah, but this one usually has a village.

1919
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,030
Yeah, what's the percentage?

1920
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,430
What's the percentage?

1921
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:32,610
I don't know.

1922
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:35,070
I just have a magic mind.

1923
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:41,310
Oh, so you're just... You're basing it off of... Not even science, off of magic.

1924
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:42,430
You're basing it off of science.

1925
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,210
You're not even basing it off of science.

1926
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,530
It's off of belief.

1927
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:49,130
Yeah, my belief is what I know.

1928
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,470
You believe in the Minecraft gods.

1929
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:56,830
I believe in magic in a young girl's heart.

1930
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,350
She believes in the heart of the cards, guys.

1931
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,190
The heart of the cards.

1932
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:04,710
I literally own Exodia, okay?

1933
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,710
Oh my god, where the fuck are you?

1934
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:08,430
I'm coming!

1935
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,370
I went a little off track.

1936
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,410
I'm just waiting here.

1937
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:14,330
I don't even need to do anything.

1938
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,950
Did you get everything from the village?

1939
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:18,070
Yeah, I got everything.

1940
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:18,950
Did you get all the torches?

1941
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,970
You got all the torches?

1942
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,350
Yes, I got all the torches, yes.

1943
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:22,350
What else did you get?

1944
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:23,890
I got all the hay.

1945
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:25,150
What else was there?

1946
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,010
What was in the boxes?

1947
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,050
In the chests?

1948
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,730
It was nothing.

1949
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:29,690
It was books.

1950
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:33,310
It was books and... What's in my inventory?

1951
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:35,650
Oh my god, it's not even this biome.

1952
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,530
Oh my god, it's a sand biome.

1953
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:42,390
Alright.

1954
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,770
Oh, did you go to that nether thing?

1955
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:46,430
Yeah, I did.

1956
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,090
I did.

1957
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:48,890
Okay.

1958
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:51,950
Is she telling the truth, Chad?

1959
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:53,250
I did.

1960
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:54,970
I want a different bed.

1961
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,110
I want a green one.

1962
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:57,630
There's greens here.

1963
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,670
I know, I'm grabbing them.

1964
01:12:59,190 --> 01:12:59,750
Oh, you're here?

1965
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,210
Yeah.

1966
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,290
Oh my god.

1967
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,150
I see you.

1968
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:08,570
Alright, are you ready?

1969
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:10,010
Ready for what?

1970
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,350
I left some hay for you.

1971
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:13,350
Oh my god, this guy is fucking a sheep.

1972
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,970
What?

1973
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,870
Oh, okay, they're done.

1974
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:18,710
Oh, I'm glad I missed it.

1975
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,490
I'm glad I wasn't here to witness that.

1976
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:23,850
We're in New Zealand.

1977
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,030
What?

1978
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:27,430
Sorry,

1979
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:30,850
New Zealand.

1980
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:33,290
Hey, you didn't get all the torches.

1981
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,830
There's literally torches in here.

1982
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,190
There's torches all around.

1983
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:38,190
What are you talking about?

1984
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,010
I left them for you.

1985
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:39,910
I left them for you.

1986
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,070
No, oh my god.

1987
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,570
I asked, did you get all the torches?

1988
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,390
And you said, yep, I got all the torches.

1989
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:46,630
You're a liar.

1990
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:48,170
You're a liar.

1991
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:49,790
No, no.

1992
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:51,110
You're lazy.

1993
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:52,990
You were here for so long.

1994
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,210
No, I was not lazy.

1995
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:57,270
I left them because I was being a considerate teammate.

1996
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:58,850
And I was like, you know what?

1997
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,450
I'm gonna leave these torches for a minute.

1998
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,930
I bet she'll need them too.

1999
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:04,910
You didn't get any of them, did you?

2000
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:06,670
No, I did.

2001
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,170
I literally have 50 torches in my inventory.

2002
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:10,830
50 torches?

2003
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:11,850
Yeah.

2004
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:14,250
Chat, is this real?

2005
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,250
I have 51.

2006
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:15,970
I have 51.

2007
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,010
Chat, is this real?

2008
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,310
52, 53.

2009
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:18,770
You know what?

2010
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,450
Fuck it, you don't deserve any of these torches.

2011
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,330
I'm taking them back.

2012
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,870
I'm taking all of them back now.

2013
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:26,330
Okay, good.

2014
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:29,030
You can put all of them in the caves then.

2015
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:32,030
We gotta get iron before we go into the caves.

2016
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:32,970
No, we don't.

2017
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,110
We just go into the caves to get iron.

2018
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:36,290
Don't we need to get the iron so that... No, we don't.

2019
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:37,130
I believe in us.

2020
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:37,870
I believe in us.

2021
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:38,870
I don't.

2022
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:40,170
We died two times.

2023
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:43,010
One time was in the cave.

2024
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,910
One time.

2025
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,030
The other time, I slipped.

2026
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:46,550
You slipped?

2027
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:49,950
Also, finally, it's her fault.

2028
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,570
She finally took the blame.

2029
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:55,510
I slipped because you didn't warn me about the giant.

2030
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,410
I think we gotta get some iron.

2031
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,330
Alright, where are you?

2032
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,310
Where did you go?

2033
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:08,710
Kill the iron golem?

2034
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:09,790
He'll kill us first.

2035
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:11,730
We're too... Wait, wait, no.

2036
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:13,590
Not if we like stand up and kill him.

2037
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,310
We need... Is that on these pillars?

2038
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,790
Oh, we need a... We need like... What's it called?

2039
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:19,930
What?

2040
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,170
We need armor.

2041
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:23,390
No, we don't.

2042
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,730
Yes, we do!

2043
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:25,990
No, we don't.

2044
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:28,910
We'll find armor in the fucking caves.

2045
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:30,530
Why are you so scared?

2046
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:32,930
Why do you mean we need... We'll find it in the caves.

2047
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:34,810
Do you think armor just grows in caves?

2048
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:39,610
No, we'll find the iron to make the armor in the caves.

2049
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,450
Why are you so scared?

2050
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:43,350
Why are you so scared?

2051
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,910
Because we died three times.

2052
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,310
Yeah, but that's not... That's not my fault.

2053
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:59,530
You guys... I think we... I feel like we need like a poll.

2054
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:03,350
Like a who's in the right here kind of poll.

2055
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:08,830
I feel...

2056
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:10,510
We can't die.

2057
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:12,190
This is... This is the... If we...

2058
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:12,870
This is the run.

2059
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:13,810
This is actually the run.

2060
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:17,450
If we die in this run, everyone will make fun of us.

2061
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,810
Everyone will make fun of us.

2062
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:23,650
We... I don't want them to make fun of us.

2063
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,790
It will take us 20 days.

2064
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,310
Where are you?

2065
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:29,470
Where did you go?

2066
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,730
I'm gathering...

2067
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,250
I'm gathering torches.

2068
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:33,430
Okay, are you ready?

2069
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:34,410
Um, no.

2070
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:37,010
Okay, we can head straight and see if we bump into a mountain.

2071
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:37,810
Okay, okay, okay.

2072
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,930
Does that satisfy you?

2073
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:39,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2074
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:40,890
Alright, do you need bread?

2075
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:42,830
Um, eventually.

2076
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:44,910
No, just take the bread now.

2077
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,050
Here, I'm gonna throw it at you.

2078
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:46,830
I'm gonna make it ring.

2079
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:48,230
Oh, bread!

2080
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,090
Make it ring!

2081
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:51,370
Turn around!

2082
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:52,850
Turn around right now!

2083
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:53,790
Make it ring!

2084
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,590
Oh, oh, oh, I gotta go back.

2085
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,730
Wait, wait, wait, no, that's...

2086
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,430
Wait, did you not mean to throw that?

2087
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:04,050
I just hit through like the entire...

2088
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:04,630
It's fine.

2089
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:05,450
It's fine.

2090
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:06,270
I have another stack.

2091
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:07,690
Yeah, don't worry about everybody.

2092
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,150
We're good.

2093
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,430
Okay.

2094
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,430
Alright.

2095
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,090
We're adventurers.

2096
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:13,590
This is the run.

2097
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,890
I think we can work together.

2098
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:20,850
If we find frogs before we find iron...

2099
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:22,850
If we found frogs...

2100
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:24,870
Wait, oh, is that the...

2101
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:26,470
Oh, that's the temple you were talking about, right?

2102
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,030
No, that's a different temple.

2103
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:28,850
Oh.

2104
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:31,430
Oh, yeah, teach me how to do this.

2105
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:32,850
Yeah, yeah, I can teach you, I can teach you.

2106
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,590
Okay, it's really delicate though, okay?

2107
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:36,550
Okay.

2108
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:39,270
Do you want me to be in there?

2109
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:41,590
Do you want me to go inside?

2110
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,370
You can watch from a distance if you want.

2111
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,530
Oh, I can watch from above.

2112
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,090
There might be someone in here, so get your stuff out.

2113
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:50,570
Alright, I'll watch from here.

2114
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:51,550
From up here?

2115
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:53,070
I'm in cinematic mode right now.

2116
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:54,270
Alright, hold on, I need my torches.

2117
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,890
Okay, I'm gonna torch this up a little bit.

2118
01:17:58,410 --> 01:17:58,770
Alright.

2119
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:00,930
I'm watching.

2120
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,170
Okay, I like to start from the one over here, can you see?

2121
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:05,690
Yeah, yeah, I can see.

2122
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:06,370
You can?

2123
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,370
Okay.

2124
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:07,770
Alright.

2125
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,550
Alright, so I like to come in slowly.

2126
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,910
Okay, so this is where...

2127
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:16,230
You have to start making your...

2128
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:17,850
Your...

2129
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:18,750
Staircase.

2130
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,750
Okay.

2131
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,510
And what happens?

2132
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,690
And then I get to the bottom and I win.

2133
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:26,430
And I get all the treasure.

2134
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:30,030
But you have to disable the button before you do anything.

2135
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:31,190
Oh my God, that was close.

2136
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:32,510
Did you get the button?

2137
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,370
No, I'm making my way to the bottom.

2138
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:38,110
Wait, can you dig some of the parts above us so I can have a better view?

2139
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:39,950
No, I can't do that.

2140
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:42,010
No, I can't do that.

2141
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:44,310
No, I can't do that.

2142
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:45,610
I can't see anything.

2143
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:46,630
You'll see.

2144
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,170
Hold on, can you see?

2145
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:49,970
Wait, I'm almost there.

2146
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:50,890
I'm almost there.

2147
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,770
No, I can't, there's literally...

2148
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,110
Okay!

2149
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,690
Oh yeah, you can't see.

2150
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:57,930
Hold on, I'll come back up.

2151
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,070
Wait, can you dig like...

2152
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:02,250
Okay, just dig around here so I can have like a view.

2153
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:03,530
You can come in now actually.

2154
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:05,310
Oh wait, did you got it?

2155
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:05,550
Yeah.

2156
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:08,490
Oh, armor trim.

2157
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:14,720
Gold.

2158
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,500
Okay, so a zombie might fall here, so I'm gonna...

2159
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,920
What do you mean a zombie might fall?

2160
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:22,420
Because there's...

2161
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:23,900
Because it's night time.

2162
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,620
Okay, I'm asleep, I'm asleep.

2163
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,380
A zombie might have fallen into our heads.

2164
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,600
Oh, enchanted.

2165
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,320
Oh, a saddle.

2166
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,480
Oh, we need gunpowder.

2167
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,880
I'm just gonna grab gunpowder for the sake of it.

2168
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:42,540
We need string?

2169
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:44,600
Um, I don't know.

2170
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,620
We'll grab some bones.

2171
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:47,780
Actually, we do.

2172
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,220
Well, we need to make a bow and arrows probably.

2173
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,000
We don't need copper, right?

2174
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:53,920
No.

2175
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,980
Okay, I'm getting that out.

2176
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,060
I'll take the string.

2177
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,560
I'll take the string.

2178
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:05,560
Alright, I think I have too much stuff.

2179
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,060
What is the fire charge for?

2180
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,920
Will we need that?

2181
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:08,880
No.

2182
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,140
Alright.

2183
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,060
Okay, I'm gonna dig my way out of here.

2184
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,200
There's stairs.

2185
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,180
There's little stairs.

2186
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,400
That I've created.

2187
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,620
There's actual stairs.

2188
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:22,680
Oh, you did it?

2189
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:23,360
Yes, I did.

2190
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,600
Oh, you did it.

2191
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,260
We have to keep creating them.

2192
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,740
Hey, why'd you hit me?

2193
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:26,940
Exactly.

2194
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,900
I'm trying to create the stairs for us!

2195
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,280
Just place blocks!

2196
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,320
Oh my god.

2197
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,180
Like that.

2198
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,320
There you go.

2199
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:37,840
I did it.

2200
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,880
Yeah, you did it.

2201
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,360
Good job.

2202
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:40,800
Thank you.

2203
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,920
Taking my torches back.

2204
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,560
There's a creeper in front of us, by the way.

2205
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:48,600
No.

2206
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,520
And he's like...

2207
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,100
Oh, he disappeared.

2208
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:52,820
Oh no, he's over there.

2209
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,460
He walked away.

2210
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:55,440
Alright, get over here.

2211
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,920
Come on, we gotta find your iron.

2212
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,000
Where's the creeper?

2213
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,220
Oh, no, that's a cactus.

2214
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,100
That's a cactus, idiot!

2215
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,520
Look in front of you.

2216
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,540
In front of me?

2217
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:04,920
Look in front of you.

2218
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,180
Yeah, you wanna call me an idiot again?

2219
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,120
You wanna go up to this cactus?

2220
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,220
Go up to the cactus!

2221
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:14,720
Kill him!

2222
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,000
Kill him!

2223
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,020
Kill him!

2224
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,180
Why are you not doing anything, Doki?

2225
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:22,620
He's aggravated!

2226
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,880
Wow, good job.

2227
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:25,900
You did nothing.

2228
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,920
You did absolutely nothing.

2229
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,060
You're a coward, you little chicken.

2230
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,140
A coward would've ran away.

2231
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,040
I was there.

2232
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,780
Yeah, taking two steps back every two seconds.

2233
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,040
Yeah.

2234
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,700
I was a journalist.

2235
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:41,820
I'm here to record.

2236
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,440
I covered wars, you know.

2237
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,160
What war?

2238
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,180
What was your favorite war?

2239
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,980
The war...

2240
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:53,400
The great creeper war of 2024.

2241
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,580
Oh, is that another village?

2242
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,520
That's my favorite.

2243
01:21:59,020 --> 01:21:59,900
No, I think that's a temple.

2244
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,980
A mini temple, right?

2245
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,020
There's no such thing as a mini temple.

2246
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,040
Wait, but you can dig under that.

2247
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,440
Oh, that thing.

2248
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,160
That is just a water fountain.

2249
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,820
I think this is another temple.

2250
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,220
Let's see.

2251
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,500
You know what would be easier?

2252
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,400
We just dig down.

2253
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,340
Oh, wait.

2254
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,440
What's wrong with this one?

2255
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,680
I think that's the door.

2256
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,920
I need to spawn in.

2257
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,000
Dig down.

2258
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:27,320
Do it.

2259
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,760
You're the one who suggested it.

2260
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,120
You're the ones like, you know what's easier?

2261
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,280
Digging down.

2262
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,360
Why don't you go in?

2263
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,240
What do you mean?

2264
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,080
Do you want to do that?

2265
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,480
There's nothing important there.

2266
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,040
Yes, there is.

2267
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,300
I'm gonna watch you do it now.

2268
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,920
From up here, I'll watch you do it now.

2269
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:48,160
Oh, okay.

2270
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:48,720
Alright.

2271
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,920
Let's restart the seed.

2272
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:51,440
That's fine.

2273
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,460
You have no confidence in yourself.

2274
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,460
Come on, Doki.

2275
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,960
Doki, you have no confidence in yourself.

2276
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,520
You think I saw what you were doing?

2277
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,380
You think I saw what you were doing?

2278
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,200
What are you talking about?

2279
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,100
I was doing the same exact thing you did.

2280
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,840
I couldn't see what you were doing.

2281
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,380
All I could see was this.

2282
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:10,220
Oh, you said you could see.

2283
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,840
I could see until you went down.

2284
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,960
Come on, scaredy cat.

2285
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:14,980
Scaredy crow.

2286
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:15,780
Come on.

2287
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,580
You know what?

2288
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,780
This run was going on for too long anyway.

2289
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,300
No, you got this.

2290
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,800
Just dig stairs.

2291
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,840
Dig stairs and make sure nothing touches the button.

2292
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,000
That's all you gotta do.

2293
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,860
Are you scared?

2294
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,660
No, I'm not scared.

2295
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:35,140
I just think that I know I'm gonna fuck it up.

2296
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,040
There might be iron in there.

2297
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,540
Come on.

2298
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,140
What are you doing?

2299
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,080
I'm digging stairs.

2300
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,300
What do you think I'm doing?

2301
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:45,840
I couldn't tell.

2302
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,180
Oh, yeah.

2303
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,620
That was what my perspective was too.

2304
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,240
You disappeared.

2305
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:54,980
Oh, there you are.

2306
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:59,000
Now you know how I felt when I...

2307
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,900
I'm too far from the hole.

2308
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,020
Should it be like here?

2309
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,780
Yeah, you gotta like...

2310
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,420
Kind of be on the inside of it.

2311
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,080
Kind of remember how my stairs were?

2312
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:09,160
No.

2313
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,020
Guys, this is what I have to deal with.

2314
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,500
My gold pickaxe died.

2315
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,480
Okay, come back up, Doki.

2316
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:26,160
It's okay.

2317
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,220
Come on, Doki.

2318
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,020
Let's just keep going.

2319
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,200
How long did it last, Doki?

2320
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:36,300
It last like...

2321
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,820
10 rocks.

2322
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,520
Yeah, I know.

2323
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:43,960
Come on, let's just go.

2324
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,460
It had bending on it.

2325
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,120
It had bending on it.

2326
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,880
It had bending on it.

2327
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,680
Wait, the actual village.

2328
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,520
Oh, now we found a village.

2329
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,080
Yay.

2330
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,020
Oh, there's a cave next to it too.

2331
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,680
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's right next to a cave.

2332
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,320
We could water bucket down there.

2333
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,880
Oh my god, we could if we can find some iron.

2334
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:07,760
Yeah.

2335
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,080
That's all we need, right?

2336
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,780
That's what we need, yep.

2337
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,520
These villages suck, man.

2338
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,960
I know, these sand villages are so poor.

2339
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:18,540
I know.

2340
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,040
No wonder they live in the desert.

2341
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,540
I got nothing here.

2342
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:28,020
It's like they're focused more on like survival and water than like actually having anything.

2343
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:37,280
It's like they hate items, but they just, you know, only think about...

2344
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,960
Like, you know, the bare necessities to win.

2345
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:41,860
Yeah, exactly.

2346
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:42,800
It's ridiculous.

2347
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,960
Oh, I got a lot of bread though.

2348
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,500
Yeah, there's a lot of bread in this village.

2349
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,380
That's all they do, they just want food.

2350
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,100
Yeah, what is up with that?

2351
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,680
What's wrong with them and food?

2352
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:52,340
I don't understand.

2353
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:53,720
I don't get it, I don't get it.

2354
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:57,240
It's like they're losing...

2355
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,440
Oh wait, there's sheep too.

2356
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,740
Okay, there are two sheeps.

2357
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,340
There's two sheeps.

2358
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:08,260
We could've gotten the saddle for the camel.

2359
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,360
Oh, I didn't think that we would see another camel.

2360
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,940
Wait, I have a saddle, I have a saddle.

2361
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,680
Oh, you got it, nice, put it on the camel.

2362
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,920
Where's the camel?

2363
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,420
He's around, there he is.

2364
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,680
Put it on him.

2365
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,820
Can we both ride it?

2366
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,100
Oh my god, we can!

2367
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,360
We can, wait!

2368
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,660
We have to befriend the camel?

2369
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,120
No, we can just ride it.

2370
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,460
Are you on?

2371
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,540
Oh yeah, look at us!

2372
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,080
We're so cute!

2373
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,740
Wait, how do we change POV again?

2374
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,400
F5.

2375
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,680
Oh my god, look at us!

2376
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,940
Actually, we don't need...

2377
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:45,260
We don't need a water bucket.

2378
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,720
We can just use a boat and drop into the cave.

2379
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:49,040
Oh, that's true.

2380
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:49,940
But what about camel?

2381
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,360
He would die.

2382
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,280
Wait, jump down the cave with camel, will we die with him?

2383
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,740
Okay, this is a science experiment, everybody.

2384
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,660
Like, does he act like a boat?

2385
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,680
Does he act like a boat?

2386
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,960
This is a really important question, everybody.

2387
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,120
You guys, this is a really important question.

2388
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,120
This is a really important...

2389
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,460
Don't land on the lava.

2390
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,560
Do not...

2391
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,300
Do not land on the lava.

2392
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,120
Is this...

2393
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:18,660
Is this...

2394
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,520
You guys, all I see is 07s.

2395
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,320
I'm not seeing anybody telling me an answer.

2396
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,080
Yeah, we need to know.

2397
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,180
Is the camel like a boat?

2398
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,580
Is it...

2399
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,300
What if we like...

2400
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,120
We jump down with the camel and we do like MLG gaming and we get off the camel before it hits.

2401
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,760
Do we get the same fault?

2402
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,140
Does physics work?

2403
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,640
Camel is not a boat.

2404
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,860
I repeat, camel is not a boat.

2405
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:44,320
Okay.

2406
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:47,500
Okay.

2407
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,480
They didn't say anything.

2408
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,200
No!

2409
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:54,380
They all wanted to watch the science experiment.

2410
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:56,100
Wow.

2411
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,860
They were all curious about the science experiment we're doing.

2412
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,880
This camel is so fucking slow.

2413
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,580
Why did we waste our saddle on this camel?

2414
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,520
Because we wouldn't ever get a...

2415
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,260
Let's be honest, we would never get a...

2416
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:16,160
Oh wait, I can jump.

2417
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:17,060
Yeah.

2418
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,600
They're pretty nifty.

2419
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:20,900
Oh my god, I can jump.

2420
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,640
What's the point of having camels in Minecraft?

2421
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,160
They're cute, I think.

2422
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:27,860
Like, do they do anything?

2423
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,600
No, I don't think so.

2424
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,300
Oh, they can swim.

2425
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,420
They cannot swim.

2426
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:34,340
No, they cannot.

2427
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,140
The camel was gonna drown.

2428
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,120
I'm going over to this nether portal.

2429
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:39,980
I'll be back.

2430
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,860
I'm taking the camel with me.

2431
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,500
To the nether portal?

2432
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:44,760
Yeah.

2433
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,920
Camel keeps running away.

2434
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,620
He doesn't wanna go.

2435
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,420
I'm heading over.

2436
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,900
Here I am.

2437
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,360
I thought we were trying to find a mountain.

2438
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,280
Yeah, we need to find one.

2439
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,740
We just need to find iron.

2440
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,500
Might as well go this way.

2441
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,280
Follow me.

2442
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,360
Follow me and the camel.

2443
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:06,640
Wait, hold on.

2444
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,620
I'm making bread.

2445
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,480
I have so much bread.

2446
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,380
Why do you need more bread?

2447
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,340
Because I just wanna make bread.

2448
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,800
I'm running out of space.

2449
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,060
Wait, don't push me.

2450
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:15,520
Don't push me.

2451
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,920
I have all the power.

2452
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,160
Okay.

2453
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:27,700
Look at this.

2454
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,140
I'm looking.

2455
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:29,960
What is that?

2456
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,700
I got golden armor now.

2457
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,600
I thought you said gold sucks.

2458
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,060
It does, but it's all I got.

2459
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:36,960
Let's go onward.

2460
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,360
You know you can run.

2461
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,180
Just run with the camel.

2462
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:42,300
Okay, you do it.

2463
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,420
Come on.

2464
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,280
Here we go.

2465
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:46,860
That's running?

2466
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,280
Actually, he's pretty fast for a camel.

2467
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:51,020
That's running?

2468
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,240
Yeah, we're running.

2469
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:53,960
Wait, he can't swim.

2470
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:54,520
What do we do?

2471
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,060
You can just walk.

2472
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,260
And then we just climb back on.

2473
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,160
What do you mean climb back on?

2474
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,180
Wait, what are you talking about?

2475
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,520
Oh my god.

2476
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,340
Just keep climbing back on.

2477
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,100
Keep going.

2478
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:09,800
We're almost there.

2479
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,400
Okay, wait.

2480
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,400
We need to sleep.

2481
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,340
Time to sleep.

2482
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,140
Good night, everybody.

2483
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,240
Wait, why is the camel walking back?

2484
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:18,820
He'll be fine.

2485
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,020
Oh, he's in the water.

2486
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,300
That's right.

2487
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,000
You can never leave camel.

2488
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,080
You can't leave.

2489
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:30,060
You're part of our gang now.

2490
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,960
We stole their camel.

2491
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,040
We're still in the desert.

2492
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,120
We might find some though.

2493
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:37,800
Let's go check.

2494
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,400
In the desert?

2495
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:40,660
Maybe.

2496
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,320
I don't know.

2497
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,780
I'm not a desert expert.

2498
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,740
We're never gonna leave this god forsaken land.

2499
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,200
Wait.

2500
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:50,560
What?

2501
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,680
There might be.

2502
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,300
But there isn't.

2503
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,100
It's just sand.

2504
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:57,040
I saw some other stuff in there.

2505
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,160
No, you didn't.

2506
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:58,760
I saw.

2507
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,080
I really did.

2508
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,840
I see it right there.

2509
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:03,700
No, you didn't.

2510
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,220
You're just seeing things.

2511
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,020
I don't see it.

2512
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,180
You gotta take your meds again.

2513
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,420
You haven't taken your meds.

2514
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,520
I haven't taken my meds.

2515
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,660
Wait, we can look at the side of this mountain.

2516
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,720
It's not even a mountain.

2517
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,800
It's just sand.

2518
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,420
I saw a copper.

2519
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,740
We gotta get out of sand land.

2520
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,340
Well, if you would slow down.

2521
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,060
Let me catch up.

2522
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,500
You're literally faster than this camel.

2523
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,240
Wait, I wonder.

2524
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:29,540
You should run.

2525
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,260
Run as the camel and see if I can catch up.

2526
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,840
Wait, how do I run?

2527
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,120
Do I just press space bar?

2528
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,240
No, it's...

2529
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,600
You're running.

2530
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,560
You're normal running.

2531
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:41,780
What's wrong?

2532
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:42,620
Why can't you run?

2533
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:43,720
Yeah, shift.

2534
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:46,420
No, shift is crouch.

2535
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,540
Oh, no, I have my keybinds different.

2536
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,300
Oh.

2537
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:51,600
Oh my God, he's sitting down for me.

2538
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,040
Are you good?

2539
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:53,700
He's just surfing.

2540
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,820
You know, he's like surfing on the land.

2541
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,080
Wait, what?

2542
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,300
I'm on top of him.

2543
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,440
Yeah, no, no, he's like...

2544
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:03,700
He's like sitting down while surfing on the land right now.

2545
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:04,480
What?

2546
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:08,820
Oh my God, it's like we're surfing.

2547
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,840
What are you talking about?

2548
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:11,980
I think you're lagging.

2549
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,580
No, we're literally...

2550
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,840
We're literally surfing.

2551
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,000
We're sad surfing.

2552
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:22,180
What are you talking about?

2553
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,920
Okay, speaking of someone taking meds...

2554
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,580
No, I think I accidentally ate something wrong.

2555
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:32,380
I might have ate some of the wild mushrooms up here.

2556
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:33,140
Uh -oh.

2557
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:36,100
Oh, you ate the beef, but it wasn't cooked.

2558
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:39,560
You have like probably a cow brain disease or something.

2559
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,040
Oh, there's coal up there.

2560
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:41,580
Thank God.

2561
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,840
We don't need coal.

2562
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:44,740
Yes, we do.

2563
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,460
We don't need it.

2564
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,580
I'll get it.

2565
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:51,100
Why?

2566
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,280
Don't leave me.

2567
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,420
We need the coal.

2568
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,720
It's a lot of coal.

2569
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,980
Oh, it was the rotten meat.

2570
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,280
Oh no.

2571
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,140
Get back here.

2572
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:05,660
When's the last time you hydrated?

2573
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,200
Oh, that's a good question.

2574
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,040
Look at her go in the water.

2575
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,160
Look at her go.

2576
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,960
I'm gonna drink the water in this ocean.

2577
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,320
I'm gonna drink all the salt.

2578
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,100
You can go crazy with that, you know.

2579
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:20,600
I know.

2580
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,140
You wanna try it?

2581
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,520
Yeah, sure.

2582
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:24,540
That'd be a fun stream.

2583
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:26,260
We should do that off of collab.

2584
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,860
We keep drinking salt water until somebody goes crazy.

2585
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,120
Viewer's discretion is advised.

2586
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,320
Don't try this at home.

2587
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,420
Wait, how do I make this?

2588
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,320
Wait, I think we're getting out of the sand land.

2589
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,920
Oh, I can only make one?

2590
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,860
Why is there more sand in front of me?

2591
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,360
Oh, dang it.

2592
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,900
How is there more sand?

2593
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:01,980
There's more sand!

2594
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,780
Oh my god.

2595
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,640
By the way, Min, I went forward.

2596
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:09,760
Yeah, I know.

2597
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:10,640
I saw where you went.

2598
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,280
Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna keep going forward until the sand stops.

2599
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:17,440
You could wait like two seconds for me to catch up.

2600
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,260
I'm pretty sure the camel is slower than actually walking.

2601
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,000
It might be.

2602
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,400
Where are you?

2603
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:28,540
Did you go in the water?

2604
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,800
Across the ocean.

2605
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,280
Wait, how did you do that?

2606
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:33,460
With the camel.

2607
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,120
I told you the strat.

2608
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,880
We keep walking until...

2609
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,740
I'm here, okay.

2610
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,360
What do you mean you're here?

2611
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:42,440
Across another area.

2612
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,360
Of water?

2613
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,340
Wait, I don't think you know where I am.

2614
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,120
Am I going the right way, guys?

2615
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:52,180
I am at...

2616
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,680
195 and counting.

2617
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,560
Negative 195.

2618
01:34:58,140 --> 01:34:59,420
Yeah, I'm going up.

2619
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,280
I'm a little...

2620
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,560
Oh, did you hit a jungle?

2621
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,500
Wait, what?

2622
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:06,840
There's a jungle?

2623
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,280
You went the wrong way.

2624
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,080
No, I'm going towards 195.

2625
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:12,940
I'm at negative 195.

2626
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,020
Or almost.

2627
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,180
You're at the wrong way.

2628
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,780
There is no jungle here.

2629
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,120
Why am I always finding jungles?

2630
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,080
I'm at negative 20...

2631
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:24,940
20...

2632
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:27,140
04, 350.

2633
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:29,880
But you know what happens when someone is lost?

2634
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,460
You literally stop moving, okay?

2635
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,180
Why don't you ever stop moving?

2636
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,420
You're the one that's lost, not me.

2637
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:37,820
Are you still on the camel?

2638
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,000
Yeah.

2639
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,120
Okay, I'll find you.

2640
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,140
I've never stopped being on the camel.

2641
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,200
What's your Z position?

2642
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:46,560
350.

2643
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,040
321.

2644
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:49,840
Okay.

2645
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:50,900
Okay.

2646
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:52,620
Stop moving!

2647
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,020
I have to go in like a diagonal.

2648
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,480
Oh my god!

2649
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,900
Okay, I'm gonna make a peepee tower.

2650
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,080
I'm gonna do it.

2651
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,400
Okay, make a peepee tower.

2652
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,080
Do it.

2653
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,520
No, that's a waste of my resources.

2654
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:09,680
You can destroy the peepee tower once you make something.

2655
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,900
Okay, I made the peepee tower.

2656
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:14,560
What if I fall from the peepee tower?

2657
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,640
Hold on, I'll find you first.

2658
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,120
I made a peepee tower.

2659
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:19,860
Where are you?

2660
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,680
What's your coordinate?

2661
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,000
Over.

2662
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:22,980
I didn't move.

2663
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,980
Tell me your coordinate.

2664
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,620
Your chat can retell you the coordinates.

2665
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,080
Chat, what's the coordinate?

2666
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:38,380
What's the coordinates, chat?

2667
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:40,700
Oh, they said...

2668
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,260
My chat says, no, we cannot.

2669
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:43,500
They're not helping me.

2670
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:46,980
Minus...

2671
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,880
Minus...

2672
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:48,960
2003...

2673
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,060
And 327.

2674
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,000
327?

2675
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:53,760
Oh shoot, okay.

2676
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:55,840
Alright, I'm on my way.

2677
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,980
Which side are you on?

2678
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,680
Left or right?

2679
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,540
I'm coming probably...

2680
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,220
Probably from your left.

2681
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,120
Okay, I'm looking left.

2682
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:06,480
I'm looking for the peepee tower.

2683
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:10,400
I'm looking left.

2684
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,260
I swear, thank god these birds aren't real so they don't swoop in and fucking stab me.

2685
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:16,000
What birds are you talking about?

2686
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,740
I have birds in my resource packs.

2687
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:18,920
Oh, what?

2688
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,180
What are you playing?

2689
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,220
Hold on, I gotta eat.

2690
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,600
What do you see around you?

2691
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:28,360
Is it all sand?

2692
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,340
I see birds.

2693
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,560
Shut up, I don't care.

2694
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:31,620
I don't see the birds.

2695
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:32,980
It's all sand.

2696
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,260
You don't see any trees?

2697
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,540
No, I see cactuses.

2698
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,960
Where the fuck did you go?

2699
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,780
Wait, you're at 20... You're at 2000 what?

2700
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,400
Dude, negative 2003.

2701
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:48,980
Oh, 2003!

2702
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:50,260
Oh, shoot.

2703
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:52,840
I thought you meant 2300.

2704
01:37:59,290 --> 01:37:59,690
Okay.

2705
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:01,630
I see trees here on my right.

2706
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:02,810
Wait, are you still in the forest?

2707
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:05,110
Uh, no.

2708
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:06,370
Wait, what was the other one?

2709
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:07,570
300 and what?

2710
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:09,210
I'm gonna go to the forest.

2711
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:10,770
I went the wrong way.

2712
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:13,330
I got rid of the pee pee tower.

2713
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:13,650
No!

2714
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:16,330
I'm going to the forest.

2715
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,470
I'll meet you there.

2716
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:18,490
Wait, oh, the jungle?

2717
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:20,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2718
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:25,610
In the jungle...

2719
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:27,210
The mighty jungle...

2720
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:31,990
The lion sleeps tonight...

2721
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:34,230
Oh...

2722
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:41,630
Oh...

2723
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:48,750
We're not okay anymore.

2724
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:51,690
It hasn't even been two hours.

2725
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:54,970
We made zero progress.

2726
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:56,670
We still don't have iron!

2727
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:58,570
Yeah, we don't have any iron.

2728
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:02,450
I'm at 460, negative 2077 now.

2729
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:03,790
460?

2730
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:06,830
Yeah, negative 20...

2731
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:07,990
Oh, I see you!

2732
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:10,170
Wait, where are you?

2733
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:10,690
I'm swimming.

2734
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:11,490
Hold on.

2735
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:13,530
Oh, I see you.

2736
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:14,890
I'm gonna go to this other side anyway.

2737
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,470
Okay.

2738
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:17,270
Go back.

2739
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,070
Keep going.

2740
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:22,130
This camel is so fucking slow!

2741
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:23,230
Okay, I'm going.

2742
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:26,190
Get over here, camel.

2743
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:27,690
Alright, let's go.

2744
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,290
We're leaving this camel.

2745
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,030
We're leaving him.

2746
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,130
I'm taking my saddle back.

2747
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,490
You can take your saddle back.

2748
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:35,490
He's not in his biome.

2749
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:36,350
He's gonna die.

2750
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:42,030
I took him to the forest and now he's not in the sand anymore.

2751
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:42,550
He's gonna die!

2752
01:39:43,370 --> 01:39:45,830
Oh my god, he's gonna be too cold.

2753
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:47,190
He's like...

2754
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:50,410
He's gonna be like, the winter nights are so frigid.

2755
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:53,510
He deserved it.

2756
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:54,310
He should've been faster.

2757
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:56,970
He was pretty fast.

2758
01:39:57,390 --> 01:39:58,110
No, he wasn't.

2759
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:00,130
We're literally traveling faster than him.

2760
01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:01,410
You just don't know how to run.

2761
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,610
I know how to run with him.

2762
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:04,630
I know how to coax him.

2763
01:40:04,730 --> 01:40:06,370
Go back, grab the camel.

2764
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,510
We're too far gone.

2765
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:12,770
You're just gonna leave him like Mario to his Yoshi?

2766
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:18,190
You're the one who rode him all the way here.

2767
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:22,430
If anything, he thought that you were his mother and you're abandoning him now.

2768
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:25,630
Yeah, because he had daddy issues.

2769
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:27,890
You're the mother!

2770
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:28,230
You're the mother!

2771
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:31,750
Who causes the daddy issues?

2772
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:34,030
You literally said I was the mother.

2773
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:36,250
Where are you?

2774
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:39,430
Another thing we can do is...

2775
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:42,030
We can find a pirate.

2776
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:42,790
A sunken ship.

2777
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:45,570
We should sleep.

2778
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:47,550
Oh yeah, maybe let's sleep first.

2779
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:48,830
We should sleep.

2780
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:50,590
Where's my...

2781
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:52,130
I'm gonna get rid of this bed.

2782
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,410
We just need one bed.

2783
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:56,310
It doesn't matter anyway.

2784
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:58,410
Because we can't respawn.

2785
01:40:58,890 --> 01:40:59,930
Yeah, exactly.

2786
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:04,250
Alright, I'm ready.

2787
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:06,790
Let's be on the lookout for sunken ships.

2788
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:09,170
And we can find iron and stuff in there too.

2789
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:10,850
Why don't we just find a mountain?

2790
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:14,050
I feel like a mountain would be easier.

2791
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:17,570
Okay, well we can use the boat to get to the mountain.

2792
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:19,250
I'm looking in the water too for iron.

2793
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:21,770
I'm observing the area.

2794
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:24,070
I feel like a ship, we can see it easily.

2795
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:25,510
Let's just go forward, straight forward.

2796
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:27,070
Forward ho!

2797
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:28,850
We'll find...

2798
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,830
We'll find a mountain, right?

2799
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:32,890
Okay, ship or mountain first.

2800
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:33,890
Which do you think will come?

2801
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:35,270
I think a mountain.

2802
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,540
I'm ready.

2803
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:41,560
This is peaceful.

2804
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,000
You know what?

2805
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,700
Maybe we should work together more often.

2806
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:49,140
Somebody here keeps, you know...

2807
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:50,540
Doing it's own thing.

2808
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:52,660
I think honestly...

2809
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,920
It's been our chats...

2810
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:56,420
That are pitting us against each other.

2811
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,560
That's so true.

2812
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:00,080
Especially like...

2813
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:00,860
Dragoons.

2814
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:01,980
Wow!

2815
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,100
Wow!

2816
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:08,800
Especially...

2817
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,240
I don't want to name names.

2818
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:10,740
Dragoons.

2819
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:14,000
I know a couple of wisps.

2820
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,880
That were doing some things too.

2821
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:16,840
What does that imply?

2822
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,640
Were you wisping like...

2823
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,140
I'm not gonna tell you where the coordinates are.

2824
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,980
My dragoons will tell me the coordinates if I ask them.

2825
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:26,860
Actually, I think wisps hate me.

2826
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,140
Sunken ship!

2827
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:33,620
Wait here.

2828
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,400
Is that a sunken ship?

2829
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:40,760
Yeah, but it's not very big, so you don't need to come in.

2830
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,420
You just want to keep all the iron to yourself.

2831
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:45,720
There is no iron.

2832
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,080
You just want to keep all the iron.

2833
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,460
You literally said sunken ships have iron.

2834
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,680
Not always, sometimes.

2835
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:51,440
Oh god, I'm gonna die.

2836
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:53,700
Get in here.

2837
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,200
Hold on, I'm putting on my new shoes.

2838
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:02,960
Alright, you have to keep on lookout of the sunken ships.

2839
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,540
I'm not looking.

2840
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:05,100
I'm on the lookout.

2841
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:06,760
Just go.

2842
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,300
There's a drown area here.

2843
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:12,420
Wait, do those areas have...

2844
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,820
Yeah, do they have like stuff?

2845
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,200
That's like a hidden temple thing.

2846
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,740
Oh, there's a drown there though.

2847
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,420
I don't think we have enough...

2848
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:22,960
We wouldn't be able to stay under the water for long enough.

2849
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:23,780
It's not worth it.

2850
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:24,580
Oh, okay.

2851
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,080
You have to like dig for the chests.

2852
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,180
Oh, I see.

2853
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:32,840
It's like treasure hunting and stuff.

2854
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:35,000
I want to give them just dig down.

2855
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,540
We could do that.

2856
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,380
I feel like...

2857
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:39,220
Oh hey, there's turtles.

2858
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:41,540
Look at the baby turtle!

2859
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,100
He's so small!

2860
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,780
Oh my god, he's shambling.

2861
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,920
Oh my god, seagull's gonna come in and fucking eat him.

2862
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:50,640
Oh no.

2863
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:53,820
Yeah, that's true.

2864
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:55,600
But we can't touch him, it's mother nature.

2865
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,780
We can't touch him.

2866
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:58,060
Yeah, we can't touch him.

2867
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,580
It's like those like...

2868
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:02,960
Nature documentaries who like...

2869
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,040
Let things happen.

2870
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,200
Yeah, even if it's a bad thing.

2871
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,700
Yeah, cause they're like...

2872
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,240
Oh, we can't interfere.

2873
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,300
That's us.

2874
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,560
We're not bad people, it's literally in the rules.

2875
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,500
We're not bad people.

2876
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,980
It's called circle of life.

2877
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:19,460
Yeah.

2878
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,420
Oh, there's a lot of drowned around here, so just go.

2879
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:24,400
I'm going, I'm going.

2880
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,640
Even though we've lost like 70% of like...

2881
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:29,980
Why are you like staying against the...

2882
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,080
Cause I'm trying to find a mountain!

2883
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,100
We're also trying to find treasure ships, right?

2884
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,940
I mean, I guess.

2885
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,840
Look, I just had a dragoon come into my chat and said I'm a dragoon and I'm sabotaging Mint.

2886
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:44,760
What do you have to say about that?

2887
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,080
I bet he's not even a dragoon.

2888
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:48,540
Who was it?

2889
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,140
Call him out.

2890
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:50,500
What's his name?

2891
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,560
What's his name?

2892
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:54,740
What's his name?

2893
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,000
I remember every dragoon.

2894
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,820
You know every single one?

2895
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,160
Yeah, I know every single one.

2896
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,520
Their name is...

2897
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:04,600
You're just making up a name now.

2898
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:06,020
QuantumTwinSpark.

2899
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,860
No, that is definitely a dragoon name.

2900
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:09,500
QuantumTwinSpark.

2901
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,180
No, no, no.

2902
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:11,880
QuantumTwoSpark.

2903
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:13,120
Sounds like it.

2904
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,600
If they're really a dragoon, they're gonna cry.

2905
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:19,460
Hey, come back.

2906
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:26,440
Oh yeah, QuantumTwinSpark literally came to my chat and said...

2907
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,540
And super chatted.

2908
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,680
Did he super chat you too?

2909
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,240
Yes.

2910
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:32,480
I'm a wisp and I'm sabotaging Doki.

2911
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,060
He's playing both teams!

2912
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:35,880
He's playing, he's not even...

2913
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:36,420
He's a...

2914
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,400
He's a wisp-goon.

2915
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:40,320
Wispy-goon.

2916
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:43,640
Maybe it's not dragoons or wisps.

2917
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,100
It's the wisp-goons.

2918
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,120
I wanna watch us both fail.

2919
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,440
They want this stream to go on forever.

2920
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:51,200
For two weeks.

2921
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,120
They want it to go on for a month.

2922
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,600
They want us to break their record.

2923
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,040
Of the longest Minecraft.

2924
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:01,820
The longest hardcore Minecraft.

2925
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:03,740
Okay, we have to...

2926
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,940
We can't die.

2927
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:07,200
We've been on the seed for way too long.

2928
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,680
For how little we've done.

2929
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,800
How little progress we've made.

2930
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:14,340
It's time to dig into a mountain.

2931
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:15,400
It's time.

2932
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,420
I'm getting off this boat.

2933
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:18,460
What the hell?

2934
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:19,660
Why is my...

2935
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,360
Oh, that was weird.

2936
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,440
My golden...

2937
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,860
Damn, two hours in and still no iron?

2938
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,360
That's a record.

2939
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,160
Because somebody refused to dig down.

2940
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:36,220
I'm just thinking of our safety.

2941
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,820
Someone here doesn't wanna dig down.

2942
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,360
I was...

2943
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,040
Stop advocating to dig down.

2944
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,240
There's a mountain in front of me.

2945
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:47,980
Every time we've dig down, we've died.

2946
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,760
I'm just trying to play it safe.

2947
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:51,960
That's two times.

2948
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:53,400
Where'd you go?

2949
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:56,920
I am at...

2950
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,760
Minus 33761598.

2951
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,320
What the hell did you just say?

2952
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,380
Your chat must've heard.

2953
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:09,020
Let's just go to the mountain.

2954
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,120
I'm literally at the mountain.

2955
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:12,900
Already?

2956
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,440
Yeah, there's a mountain in front of me.

2957
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:16,960
I'm getting there.

2958
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:17,360
I'm walking.

2959
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:19,500
Did you have to...

2960
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,820
Oh, I see you.

2961
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,660
I hope we're looking at the same mountain right now.

2962
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,320
How did that happen?

2963
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:26,500
That's weird.

2964
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:29,220
How is there just coal on the ground?

2965
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:30,580
Oh, because...

2966
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:33,180
I didn't have room in my inventory.

2967
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:34,140
That's the stuff I dug.

2968
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:37,200
I was like, that's weird.

2969
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,200
That is weird.

2970
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:39,080
Where are you?

2971
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:43,120
Which way around the mountain did you go?

2972
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,080
You're on top of the mountain?

2973
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,060
I see you.

2974
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:46,760
Stop.

2975
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:48,420
Freeze.

2976
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:54,360
No,

2977
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,620
I know the words, but I don't want to bait people.

2978
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:02,840
Oh, so true.

2979
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:04,960
I know exactly who you're talking about.

2980
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,760
You gotta try harder to get that out of me.

2981
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,860
Hey, I'm digging a hole.

2982
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,500
I'm digging a hole.

2983
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:14,880
Come on.

2984
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,740
You're gonna dig a hole?

2985
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:18,020
Yeah, we're digging into the mountain.

2986
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:19,840
Come on.

2987
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:25,160
I thought we're supposed to fucking farm around the mountain.

2988
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,740
This isn't the right kind of mountain, but it's okay.

2989
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,660
We can dig inside.

2990
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,760
Oh my god.

2991
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:31,940
Come on in.

2992
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:33,600
The stone is fine.

2993
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,220
Hey, look over here.

2994
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:36,580
Okay, I'm here.

2995
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:37,960
I'm putting a little torch there.

2996
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,160
Okay.

2997
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:39,520
Alright.

2998
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:42,560
It's time.

2999
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,600
I'm digging this side.

3000
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:47,720
I'm gonna dig the other side.

3001
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,440
What side?

3002
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:49,960
This side.

3003
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,780
Are we digging down or just digging around?

3004
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,260
What is iron usually at, guys?

3005
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,620
I don't know.

3006
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,300
I'll put torches too.

3007
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:02,360
Oops.

3008
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,440
My thing broke.

3009
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:05,880
It's fine.

3010
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,280
We're surrounded by stone.

3011
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,360
Lower?

3012
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,180
We gotta go lower?

3013
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:10,820
Oh, okay.

3014
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,620
We gotta go way lower.

3015
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:15,340
Come to my hole.

3016
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,480
And we'll start digging the hole.

3017
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,300
My head right now.

3018
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:20,980
Can you give me a sec?

3019
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,680
I'm trying to remember how to make sticks right now.

3020
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,240
Two planks.

3021
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,860
I'm struggling at the moment.

3022
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,460
Planks on top of each other.

3023
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,360
This has been too much Minecraft.

3024
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:32,740
Two planks.

3025
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:33,760
This was your idea.

3026
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:34,860
I'm just reminding you.

3027
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,620
This was both our ideas.

3028
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:38,060
You were like, that's a great idea.

3029
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:39,840
That's a great idea, Doki.

3030
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:40,540
Let's do it.

3031
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:41,400
You...

3032
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:45,040
said that you were inspired.

3033
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:46,200
You were the one inspired.

3034
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,520
Yeah, and then you were like, wow, that's a great idea.

3035
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:49,500
We should totally do it.

3036
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:53,280
Wait, do we keep going down?

3037
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,680
Yeah, keep going down.

3038
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,060
What's the coordinates?

3039
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,840
We gotta get to five.

3040
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,660
Where are we at?

3041
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,040
Like 70.

3042
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:06,300
Hold on, I gotta make a new pickaxe.

3043
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,460
I'm digging down.

3044
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:08,140
I can't.

3045
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:11,060
You're digging a stair though, right?

3046
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:14,820
Don't fall down.

3047
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,980
How do you get back up?

3048
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,700
I'm at 50.

3049
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,180
We'll find out later.

3050
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:22,820
Okay.

3051
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,240
I'm still getting more coal.

3052
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:30,920
I hear...

3053
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,420
Is that a creeper sound?

3054
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:33,220
Do you have a...

3055
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:34,360
Creepers don't make a sound.

3056
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:36,440
Creepers don't make a sound though.

3057
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,680
Doki, you can't die here.

3058
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:39,180
What's that?

3059
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,260
What does that mean?

3060
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:45,200
Oh, it's an Enderman!

3061
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,420
We found an Enderman!

3062
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,700
Oh, we need those!

3063
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:48,320
We need those!

3064
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,900
Oh my god, there's so much coal here.

3065
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:53,040
Do you have a lot of wood?

3066
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:55,460
Uh...

3067
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,400
Yeah, I do.

3068
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:00,960
Let's throw this away, we don't need this.

3069
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:05,440
What are you throwing away?

3070
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:08,140
Sandstone.

3071
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,340
Oh yeah, we don't need that.

3072
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,000
Oh my god, there's...

3073
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,400
What'd you find?

3074
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,620
Oh, thank god I didn't dig down.

3075
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:17,820
What'd you find?

3076
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,440
I found a very, very deep cave.

3077
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:25,280
I picked the right...

3078
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:29,400
Oh my god, if I dug down one more time...

3079
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:35,480
Okay, I'm digging the stairs for us.

3080
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:37,180
I'm digging the stairs for us.

3081
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,260
My duty is the stairs.

3082
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,400
I'm stair duty.

3083
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,580
If I dug one more...

3084
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:47,480
If I dug one more...

3085
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,440
This is good enough.

3086
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,320
Oh my gosh, I almost just fell into your hole.

3087
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:54,840
Wait, am I...

3088
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:56,080
There's no way, guys.

3089
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,020
I'm not...

3090
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:57,820
There's no way.

3091
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,580
What biome am I in right now?

3092
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,300
No, it's the dripstone cave.

3093
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:03,440
Someone was like, oh my god, you're in the deep dark.

3094
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:04,340
That's the dripstone.

3095
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:05,980
Oh, no, yeah.

3096
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,580
You know when you're in the deep dark.

3097
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:08,400
Because it's like...

3098
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,600
It's got the glowy stuff.

3099
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3100
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:12,740
Okay.

3101
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,980
I can't believe it.

3102
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,420
I literally stopped...

3103
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,260
Just at the right time.

3104
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:18,340
You guys, no sabotaging.

3105
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:20,480
My chat is trying to have me sabotage you.

3106
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:24,700
What?

3107
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:25,580
Why did you go silent?

3108
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,760
No, I'm just curious on how you're gonna do this.

3109
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:30,200
I'm building stairs.

3110
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:31,560
Yeah?

3111
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:37,380
It's fine.

3112
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,220
You messed this up.

3113
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:40,920
Why did you do that?

3114
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,620
How did I mess it up?

3115
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,320
Oh my god.

3116
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,640
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3117
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:46,420
There's literally one more block.

3118
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,660
If I did one more block, I would have died.

3119
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:58,560
Oh, it looks so easy.

3120
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,320
Oh, no.

3121
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:03,640
What will happen if you just...

3122
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:06,700
Let's keep going and we'll find iron eventually.

3123
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,380
Should I cover this up?

3124
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:10,580
Oh, nevermind.

3125
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:11,220
Don't go this way.

3126
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:12,360
Let's go this way.

3127
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,220
Why does it keep getting more and more dangerous?

3128
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,640
Because we're living on the edge.

3129
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,780
I don't like the edge anymore.

3130
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,900
I feel like if we dig down...

3131
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,720
This is what happens when you dig down.

3132
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:29,500
This is what you wanted.

3133
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:32,320
You wanted to dig in the mountain.

3134
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,320
You wanted to dig in the mountain.

3135
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:37,220
Ignore the copper.

3136
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:40,000
There's so many endermen near us.

3137
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:41,420
Why is there so much copper?

3138
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:44,240
Where are the fucking iron?

3139
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:45,180
Where is the iron?

3140
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:46,260
What are we at?

3141
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:47,820
Oh, we need to go further down.

3142
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,300
Yeah, but down is death.

3143
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,640
This isn't the right mountain.

3144
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,360
We need to go to the mountain.

3145
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,640
You know, the snowy peak mountain.

3146
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:57,080
Wait, I can make another stair here.

3147
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:57,480
Oh, okay.

3148
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:58,000
Go, go, go.

3149
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:58,740
Okay, wait.

3150
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,000
I need to throw some stuff away.

3151
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,880
What do I not have?

3152
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,460
Too much copper.

3153
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:03,440
Too much copper?

3154
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:04,840
The thing I told you to do.

3155
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,060
Cobble, cobble, cobble.

3156
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:07,520
Okay.

3157
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,160
We can't sabotage each other.

3158
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:11,700
No, we can't.

3159
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:14,440
You guys, this is the real thing.

3160
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:16,620
We're not restarting.

3161
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:19,120
This is where we're gonna make it.

3162
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:21,320
Oh my God.

3163
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:23,760
I hear that enderman right next to us.

3164
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:27,780
He's like right here.

3165
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:30,160
He was like literally right here.

3166
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:30,500
Yeah.

3167
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:32,540
Okay.

3168
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:34,540
What corner are we on now?

3169
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:36,400
Don't worry about it.

3170
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:37,060
Just keep going down.

3171
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:43,400
I feel like we're gonna be going down forever.

3172
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:48,980
I told you it's not the right type of mountain, but it's okay.

3173
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,540
Why didn't we just find a hole?

3174
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:53,640
Wouldn't a hole be easier?

3175
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:56,440
Maybe, I don't know.

3176
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,780
Wouldn't a hole be easier?

3177
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,080
Why didn't we just find a hole?

3178
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:00,460
Why did you make me dig a mountain?

3179
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,720
I got an eerie noise.

3180
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:09,640
Yeah, I think that was the enderman.

3181
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:10,920
No, it was Dai.

3182
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,620
Okay, we're almost close to where Iron...

3183
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:15,660
Okay, now I think we can...

3184
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:17,280
Just like tunnel.

3185
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:17,880
Okay.

3186
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:19,920
Alright, your turn.

3187
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,320
Okay, time to go forward.

3188
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,620
Why didn't monsters spawn behind us?

3189
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:26,480
Because we just left it, you know.

3190
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:28,320
Yeah, that's a potential risk.

3191
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:30,220
Okay, you know what?

3192
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,520
We like it risky.

3193
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:35,020
Oh, I hear a skelly man right next to me.

3194
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,940
Oh, that means we're like...

3195
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,440
Okay.

3196
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:39,540
How does that mean we're okay?

3197
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:43,340
That means we're like closer to the ground now.

3198
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:44,700
You know, we won't fall to our deaths.

3199
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:45,760
Okay, I'll go right side.

3200
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3201
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:49,080
I hear dripping.

3202
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,180
So we're still...

3203
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:51,700
Oh, Iron!

3204
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,120
You found Iron?

3205
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,180
I found one.

3206
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,100
Iron!

3207
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:00,040
I found one.

3208
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,920
Oh, I mean, you know...

3209
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:04,360
One is something, I guess.

3210
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:04,900
Yeah.

3211
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:08,980
I'm tired of these stone pickaxes.

3212
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,120
We'll get there soon.

3213
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,260
I'm tired of these stone pickaxes.

3214
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:15,160
When will we...

3215
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,000
When will we hit it big?

3216
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,360
When will we hit it big?

3217
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,880
When will our streamer luck kick in, man?

3218
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,540
When will our streamer luck kick in?

3219
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:25,300
When will our streamer luck kick in?

3220
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:26,460
Oh, wait, I already made a furnace.

3221
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,860
Okay, well, I have an extra one.

3222
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:30,120
Oh.

3223
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:32,680
For when we wanna cook the Iron.

3224
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,220
Actually, I could probably cook the Iron.

3225
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:36,300
What's that?

3226
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:37,680
Nothing.

3227
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,220
We'll go this way now.

3228
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:43,000
Why is that boarded up, huh?

3229
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:44,900
Why don't you check it out?

3230
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,500
No, Mint, come over here.

3231
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:48,020
Mint, come over here.

3232
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,120
You wanna know why it's boarded up?

3233
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:50,820
Alright, come over here.

3234
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:52,400
Dig it.

3235
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:57,270
Oh, there's nothing here.

3236
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:58,950
No, come on, dig another one.

3237
01:56:59,250 --> 01:56:59,810
Oh, I see.

3238
01:57:00,150 --> 01:57:01,470
Did you...

3239
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:02,290
Oh, I see.

3240
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:04,030
That's your torch, though.

3241
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:04,730
Your torch.

3242
01:57:06,110 --> 01:57:06,910
You see it?

3243
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:08,070
It was your torch.

3244
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:09,890
You're just gonna abandon it?

3245
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:10,550
Oh my god.

3246
01:57:10,610 --> 01:57:10,930
Creeper!

3247
01:57:11,110 --> 01:57:11,390
Creeper!

3248
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:20,770
Now you know why I abandoned it.

3249
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,410
Yeah, but I got your torch back.

3250
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:22,950
You're welcome.

3251
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:25,790
Oh, thank you.

3252
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:29,550
My fifty-third torch is saved.

3253
01:57:29,590 --> 01:57:30,370
It's important.

3254
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:32,310
Every torch matters.

3255
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:33,770
This is hardcore.

3256
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:36,650
Every material is precious.

3257
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:37,770
Oh.

3258
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:39,630
I'm in another area.

3259
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:41,270
What do you mean another area?

3260
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:42,290
Oh.

3261
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:45,050
Where are you going?

3262
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:46,410
Oh.

3263
01:57:47,110 --> 01:57:48,150
What does that mean?

3264
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:48,750
Iron!

3265
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:51,990
Just one?

3266
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:54,690
No, I found four.

3267
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:56,410
Yeah.

3268
01:57:57,790 --> 01:57:59,910
Four whole irons.

3269
01:58:00,110 --> 01:58:01,610
Okay, we're doing it.

3270
01:58:01,610 --> 01:58:02,810
And where's your four iron?

3271
01:58:02,810 --> 01:58:04,910
I have currently in my inventory...

3272
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:06,510
Oh, I thought I had five.

3273
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:09,190
Five, six...

3274
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:11,650
Seven...

3275
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:12,690
Eight...

3276
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:15,030
Nine...

3277
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:17,170
Ten...

3278
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:18,690
Eleven...

3279
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:20,310
Oh my god, I don't know how to count past ten.

3280
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:23,950
Thanks, Elmo.

3281
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:26,490
Did you see the SesameD Twitter account?

3282
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:28,530
That super...

3283
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:30,650
Like...

3284
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:31,350
Emo?

3285
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:32,590
Emo?

3286
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:36,630
Like, Elmo, CookieMonster, and like...

3287
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:39,130
Like, all the Sesame Street accounts were like...

3288
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:42,270
Like, it's okay guys, if you're having a bad day...

3289
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:45,930
Like, they were being like those self-help Twitter accounts.

3290
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:46,410
Oh.

3291
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:49,850
I found an area.

3292
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:51,170
Oh, I found Lapis.

3293
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:52,330
Yeah, me too.

3294
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:53,570
Wait, hold on.

3295
01:58:56,450 --> 01:58:57,050
Wait.

3296
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:00,370
I'll make sure I don't die.

3297
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:01,010
Okay.

3298
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:03,010
Is Lapis important to us?

3299
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:04,750
Um...

3300
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:06,010
Actually, yeah.

3301
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:09,010
I think we should get it for when we need to enchant stuff.

3302
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:09,830
Okay.

3303
01:59:10,070 --> 01:59:10,630
Oh, you're right.

3304
01:59:11,090 --> 01:59:12,170
We should get that.

3305
01:59:12,330 --> 01:59:15,210
Yeah, they were doing like self-help tweets instead.

3306
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:16,490
And...

3307
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:19,790
And like super encouraging stuff too.

3308
01:59:19,970 --> 01:59:21,530
I like Elmo's Twitter though.

3309
01:59:21,730 --> 01:59:22,650
He's kinda wholesome.

3310
01:59:22,730 --> 01:59:25,130
Yeah, but it was like all the Sesame Street...

3311
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:25,450
All of them?

3312
01:59:25,830 --> 01:59:26,470
Yeah, all of them.

3313
01:59:26,510 --> 01:59:27,550
It was like Cooking Monster too.

3314
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:28,770
Sesame Street, okay.

3315
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:32,030
Sesame Street is going through it.

3316
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:36,090
Wow!

3317
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:37,670
Did you almost fall?

3318
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:38,690
No.

3319
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:42,330
There's a little zombie heading over.

3320
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:43,330
He's not happy.

3321
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:45,570
Okay, let's see.

3322
01:59:45,590 --> 01:59:47,750
Why is there so much copper in here?

3323
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:50,930
Oh, he's blocked by the sword.

3324
01:59:51,330 --> 01:59:53,630
He's blocked by my little torch.

3325
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:55,710
Oh, I found a big area.

3326
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:56,790
Oh, no.

3327
01:59:58,130 --> 01:59:58,910
I want that.

3328
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:00,930
Nice, okay.

3329
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:03,050
I'm gonna grab lapis.

3330
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:03,570
Oh, look.

3331
02:00:03,650 --> 02:00:04,650
I killed my first monster.

3332
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:05,970
I'm gonna get the lapis too.

3333
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,710
Can you get it with the stone?

3334
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:11,810
Okay, nice.

3335
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:14,650
I didn't know if you could get lapis with the stone or not.

3336
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:15,670
Yeah, I can.

3337
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:16,950
What do I not need?

3338
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:17,890
No, I can't.

3339
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:19,190
Yes, you can.

3340
02:00:20,190 --> 02:00:20,970
I got it.

3341
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:21,710
Oh, wait.

3342
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:24,430
I have too much in my inventory.

3343
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:25,430
We don't need raw rabbit.

3344
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:29,270
Actually, that's food though.

3345
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:31,130
That's true.

3346
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:32,430
I need to clean my inventory.

3347
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:33,970
Should I make a shield?

3348
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:36,670
Can you eat glow berries or no?

3349
02:00:37,070 --> 02:00:37,990
Yeah, you can eat them.

3350
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:40,430
Okay, I'll just eat the glow berries.

3351
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:42,330
Where are you?

3352
02:00:42,350 --> 02:00:43,770
We don't need copper, right?

3353
02:00:44,090 --> 02:00:45,290
No, we don't need copper.

3354
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:46,990
Okay, so I can throw those away.

3355
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:50,250
Alright, I'm gonna start smelting my stuff.

3356
02:00:50,690 --> 02:00:51,190
Me too.

3357
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:54,570
I need to start smelting these as well.

3358
02:00:55,050 --> 02:00:56,410
I have a lot of iron.

3359
02:00:57,090 --> 02:00:58,810
Alright, let's make a shield.

3360
02:00:59,190 --> 02:01:00,490
And we'll make a good sword.

3361
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:01,250
Yeah!

3362
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:03,510
And I can make armor.

3363
02:01:04,970 --> 02:01:05,530
Wait a second.

3364
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:07,670
I need maybe more...

3365
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:10,190
Okay, there's my chest.

3366
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:12,790
There's my crafting table, furnace.

3367
02:01:13,490 --> 02:01:14,750
Get rid of this bamboo.

3368
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:16,050
So sad.

3369
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:20,070
Iron age happening right now.

3370
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:21,110
Oh my god, we're doing it.

3371
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:24,910
We did it!

3372
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:26,910
We're doing it!

3373
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:28,110
We're doing it!

3374
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:30,330
We're doing it!

3375
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:33,110
I don't need this gravel.

3376
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:34,130
Throw it in the garbage.

3377
02:01:34,130 --> 02:01:35,290
Oh my god.

3378
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:37,550
We're actually...

3379
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:40,130
We're actually doing it.

3380
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:44,350
We're gonna make it out of here!

3381
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:45,670
Maybe.

3382
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:48,530
They didn't believe us.

3383
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:49,030
I know.

3384
02:01:49,230 --> 02:01:51,050
They thought we were gonna die here.

3385
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:53,310
This is literally the run.

3386
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:54,130
This is the run.

3387
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:59,110
I knew that was gonna happen.

3388
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:00,870
We're safe.

3389
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:01,530
We're still safe.

3390
02:02:02,370 --> 02:02:02,550
Okay.

3391
02:02:03,410 --> 02:02:04,010
Okay.

3392
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:08,610
I'm gonna make my shield first.

3393
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:09,790
Okay.

3394
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:10,150
Okay.

3395
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:13,850
Where did I put my crafting table?

3396
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:15,110
Did I leave it over there?

3397
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:15,850
I don't know.

3398
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:18,410
Okay, I can fight him.

3399
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:19,210
Shield!

3400
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,190
Yeah!

3401
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,430
I have my shield too.

3402
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:24,570
We're gonna make it.

3403
02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:26,730
Okay, I'm gonna make a sword.

3404
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,510
And...

3405
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:31,370
This skeleton needs to be able to aim.

3406
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:34,070
I did it!

3407
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:36,150
Wait, what did you get?

3408
02:02:36,330 --> 02:02:37,610
I killed a skelly!

3409
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:39,350
Oh, you got the thingy.

3410
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:42,450
I got the shield, yeah.

3411
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:43,210
Okay, nice.

3412
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:44,070
Okay.

3413
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:47,270
Now I'm gonna make armor.

3414
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:50,070
Oh, I should make armor first.

3415
02:02:52,030 --> 02:02:53,790
I want the iron pickaxe.

3416
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:56,730
Actually, I should get iron pickaxe first.

3417
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:57,190
You're right.

3418
02:02:57,450 --> 02:02:57,890
No, no.

3419
02:02:58,030 --> 02:02:59,470
Get armor first.

3420
02:02:59,590 --> 02:02:59,910
No.

3421
02:03:00,230 --> 02:03:02,230
No, it's too late.

3422
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:03,470
Okay.

3423
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:04,910
Okay.

3424
02:03:06,730 --> 02:03:07,530
Iron pickaxe.

3425
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:08,130
There we go.

3426
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:11,390
I don't have pants, but I got some stuff.

3427
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:13,170
Wait, what?

3428
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:15,570
Why is it not working?

3429
02:03:15,670 --> 02:03:16,710
Do I have too much stuff in my inventory?

3430
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:17,450
I do.

3431
02:03:19,690 --> 02:03:22,070
I'm just gonna use my wood ones for now.

3432
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:24,090
Oh my God, I have too much stuff in my inventory.

3433
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:24,930
What do I not want?

3434
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:25,910
What do I not need?

3435
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:29,130
I don't know, but they're all important to me!

3436
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:29,890
Where are you?

3437
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:30,730
Oh, wait.

3438
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,590
Why do I have another bed?

3439
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:32,970
Where are you?

3440
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:34,170
I don't know.

3441
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:37,510
You went down here.

3442
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:38,270
Oh, I see your name.

3443
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:39,310
You're very far away.

3444
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:41,630
I don't know where I go to.

3445
02:03:41,670 --> 02:03:43,050
I go to too many places.

3446
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:43,790
I don't know.

3447
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:44,370
Oh, I see you.

3448
02:03:44,610 --> 02:03:44,970
I'm here.

3449
02:03:46,230 --> 02:03:46,510
Oh, no.

3450
02:03:46,690 --> 02:03:47,590
Oh, we have the copper.

3451
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:47,930
Okay.

3452
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:48,330
Oh, hey.

3453
02:03:48,970 --> 02:03:50,110
I'm gonna throw away the copper.

3454
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:50,670
Oh, look.

3455
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:51,510
There's more lapis here.

3456
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:54,990
Yeah, I'm trying to make armor right now.

3457
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:55,830
Okay.

3458
02:03:55,830 --> 02:03:58,810
Okay, I don't need my golden hoe.

3459
02:03:59,610 --> 02:04:00,610
I have my hoe here.

3460
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:01,530
Will this kill me?

3461
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:01,970
Yeah.

3462
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:04,410
Okay.

3463
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:07,910
We need all this for when we eventually...

3464
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:10,370
And I'm gonna throw away my stone sword.

3465
02:04:11,730 --> 02:04:12,970
Oh, I'm out of space.

3466
02:04:13,110 --> 02:04:14,330
And I'll throw this here too.

3467
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:15,490
I don't need the emerald.

3468
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:17,410
And...

3469
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:20,950
Yeah, you don't need that emerald.

3470
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:22,110
There's more to our left.

3471
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:23,330
More over here?

3472
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:28,370
No, I feel like I'm wasting wheat.

3473
02:04:29,190 --> 02:04:30,070
Wasting space.

3474
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:31,370
For the wheat?

3475
02:04:32,010 --> 02:04:37,270
Yeah, they were saying, oh, you can make wheat off of the hay and stuff, but I waste too much space there already.

3476
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:39,710
Well, if you have the...

3477
02:04:39,710 --> 02:04:43,530
If you have it turned into bread, then it's, you know...

3478
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:44,430
Yeah, but...

3479
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:46,130
Then I'll get too much bread.

3480
02:04:47,110 --> 02:04:48,350
It's good to have bread.

3481
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:49,730
No, it's too much bread.

3482
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:52,490
There's a limit to how much bread you can have.

3483
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:53,130
There's a limit.

3484
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:56,090
Okay, I need shoes and...

3485
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:57,230
Alright, let's get iron.

3486
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:57,930
Let's get iron.

3487
02:04:58,070 --> 02:04:59,470
And shoes and...

3488
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:01,070
And...

3489
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:02,470
I already have a lot of armor.

3490
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:05,970
Let's see, where's my bread?

3491
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:07,290
Wait, where did I put my bread?

3492
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:08,690
Oh, there it is.

3493
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:10,350
Wait, did you go down?

3494
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:10,870
Yeah.

3495
02:05:14,690 --> 02:05:15,510
Alright, I'm here.

3496
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:17,370
Wait, what was the purpose?

3497
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:19,970
The dripstone makes it so annoying.

3498
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:20,850
That's true.

3499
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:22,410
What's the purpose of going down here?

3500
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:23,730
I don't know.

3501
02:05:23,810 --> 02:05:24,310
To find iron?

3502
02:05:26,370 --> 02:05:27,790
Do we need more iron?

3503
02:05:28,070 --> 02:05:28,430
Yeah.

3504
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:30,230
We do?

3505
02:05:30,370 --> 02:05:33,410
We have to have a plethora of shields and...

3506
02:05:33,410 --> 02:05:34,450
And things.

3507
02:05:35,150 --> 02:05:36,070
No, you don't.

3508
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:36,830
It'll break.

3509
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:38,550
It will?

3510
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:39,370
Yes.

3511
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,650
Oh, I should make a bucket.

3512
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:45,410
Oh yeah, you can.

3513
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:47,090
Oh yeah, I'm gonna make a bucket.

3514
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:49,090
Did you leave all your stuff up there?

3515
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:50,070
Yeah.

3516
02:05:50,350 --> 02:05:51,970
I'm gonna come back to it, right?

3517
02:05:53,670 --> 02:05:54,470
Are we?

3518
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:56,030
Okay, you're right.

3519
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:57,590
I'll bring it back to me.

3520
02:05:57,970 --> 02:05:58,870
It's annoying otherwise.

3521
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:00,110
I'm gonna wait until it cooks.

3522
02:06:00,790 --> 02:06:04,510
We also gotta get to the diamond, so I guess we can start diamond hunting from here.

3523
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:06,530
Oh yeah, we might as well start now.

3524
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:06,970
Yeah.

3525
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:08,330
Okay, I'm gonna...

3526
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:10,090
Wait, where are we at?

3527
02:06:10,110 --> 02:06:10,430
25.

3528
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:13,890
So if we find iron...

3529
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:15,970
I'm gonna strip mine for iron a little bit more.

3530
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:17,190
And then if we get...

3531
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:19,110
What's the coordinates for diamond?

3532
02:06:20,690 --> 02:06:21,470
It's like...

3533
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:23,370
It's like negative...

3534
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:24,410
Alright, let's go.

3535
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:25,210
Let's dig down.

3536
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:27,110
I need more iron.

3537
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:27,570
I gotta mine.

3538
02:06:27,570 --> 02:06:29,750
We can get iron while we're digging down.

3539
02:06:30,330 --> 02:06:32,510
It stops showing up though.

3540
02:06:32,830 --> 02:06:33,670
No, it doesn't.

3541
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:35,650
It shows up with the diamond.

3542
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:37,290
No, it doesn't.

3543
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:38,170
It doesn't?

3544
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:39,330
When did it change that?

3545
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:40,490
It used to.

3546
02:06:40,490 --> 02:06:41,250
It didn't?

3547
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:43,490
No, stuff stops showing up, right?

3548
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:44,250
No, it doesn't.

3549
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:44,650
No.

3550
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:48,510
Alright, let's start digging down.

3551
02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:49,510
Alright.

3552
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:51,630
Where are you at?

3553
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:52,750
Also, I don't know why you're listening to me.

3554
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:54,710
I know less about Minecraft than you.

3555
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:56,630
I don't know, I'm just...

3556
02:06:56,630 --> 02:06:57,770
I'm just gullible maybe.

3557
02:06:59,530 --> 02:07:00,590
Wait, where did...

3558
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:01,570
Where did you go from?

3559
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:04,590
I'm trying to find where you are.

3560
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:06,330
I started to strip mine.

3561
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:07,230
Wait, where are you?

3562
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:08,290
Did you keep going forward?

3563
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:09,150
Where did you go?

3564
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:10,050
Where are you?

3565
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:11,470
Did you go down?

3566
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:13,250
Oh wait, I see you.

3567
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:15,950
I see you.

3568
02:07:16,150 --> 02:07:17,090
I'm heading back to you.

3569
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:19,110
Oh, I see you.

3570
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:20,550
Why did you go all the way over there?

3571
02:07:20,610 --> 02:07:21,310
Why would I go there?

3572
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:23,330
Where did your name go?

3573
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:24,050
Oh, nevermind.

3574
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:24,470
I'm here.

3575
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:27,570
We can go down and then we can just start digging down.

3576
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:28,690
Alright.

3577
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:29,250
Oh, there's more.

3578
02:07:29,330 --> 02:07:29,590
Hold on.

3579
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:32,830
They said it was less of a chance, but that doesn't mean we won't get it.

3580
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:33,650
We might as well.

3581
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:34,610
Okay.

3582
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:36,610
Hold on, I'm grabbing coal.

3583
02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:38,470
Alright, I'm digging down.

3584
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:40,910
Oh my gosh.

3585
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:44,130
I forgot to look at my computer yesterday and it's starting to rattle again.

3586
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:45,470
Wait.

3587
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:46,730
Wait, what?

3588
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:49,810
My fan is like all messed up.

3589
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:51,090
Oh look, see?

3590
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:51,730
I told you.

3591
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:52,690
I am right here.

3592
02:07:53,270 --> 02:07:53,510
Where?

3593
02:07:53,850 --> 02:07:54,930
Where are you?

3594
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:56,310
I just dug down.

3595
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:58,590
Are you like actually digging down?

3596
02:07:58,830 --> 02:07:59,290
Yeah.

3597
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:01,130
I dug down.

3598
02:08:01,130 --> 02:08:03,090
I dug down next to you.

3599
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:04,230
I didn't know.

3600
02:08:04,930 --> 02:08:08,030
I dug down right next to you.

3601
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:11,230
Okay, I'm digging down again.

3602
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:12,490
Okay, I'm digging down.

3603
02:08:13,550 --> 02:08:15,030
I'm digging down.

3604
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:16,810
What's the coordinates for diamond?

3605
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:18,890
Like negative 50.

3606
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:20,250
Okay.

3607
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:22,410
You're at...

3608
02:08:22,410 --> 02:08:23,570
We're at 14.

3609
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:26,530
Yeah, we gotta go.

3610
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:27,510
Oh, we gotta dig.

3611
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:31,030
Alright, how bad would it be if I...

3612
02:08:31,730 --> 02:08:33,850
If I just dug straight down?

3613
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:35,510
Like, is it worth the risk?

3614
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,310
Is it worth it?

3615
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:42,310
A seasoned Minecraft person would probably say don't do it.

3616
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:43,230
But...

3617
02:08:43,230 --> 02:08:45,310
Are we seasoned?

3618
02:08:45,650 --> 02:08:45,990
No.

3619
02:08:46,830 --> 02:08:47,970
Get over here.

3620
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:51,690
Are you willing to risk this run?

3621
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:52,410
Get over here.

3622
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:53,210
Get over here.

3623
02:08:53,650 --> 02:08:55,210
Get over here.

3624
02:08:55,330 --> 02:08:57,270
You know what that means.

3625
02:08:58,870 --> 02:08:59,370
Alright.

3626
02:09:00,510 --> 02:09:00,750
Alright.

3627
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:03,090
You dig mine, I dig yours.

3628
02:09:03,230 --> 02:09:04,770
Wait, that's an Enderman next to us.

3629
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:07,470
I think that is like an actual death pit.

3630
02:09:07,650 --> 02:09:09,190
Wait, let's...

3631
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:10,930
Okay, let me double check.

3632
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:14,890
Wait, I think there's lava next to us.

3633
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:16,510
I don't hear lava.

3634
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:20,490
I think I heard lava.

3635
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:22,810
I think I heard...

3636
02:09:22,810 --> 02:09:23,870
No, I hear the Enderman.

3637
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:25,090
No, no.

3638
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:27,710
It's...

3639
02:09:27,710 --> 02:09:28,870
This is my music?

3640
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:30,790
Is it my music?

3641
02:09:31,050 --> 02:09:31,330
I can't tell.

3642
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:32,270
There's no lava.

3643
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:35,910
Okay, it might be my music.

3644
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:37,770
Okay, are you ready then?

3645
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:38,970
Okay.

3646
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:40,310
To risk this entire run?

3647
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:41,690
I dig yours, you dig mine?

3648
02:09:41,790 --> 02:09:42,010
Okay.

3649
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:43,590
Alright, ready?

3650
02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:48,210
Wait, I need a head start, because I don't have iron.

3651
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:49,630
Wait a second.

3652
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:51,670
My pickaxe is gonna die.

3653
02:09:52,250 --> 02:09:54,110
My pickaxe is gonna die.

3654
02:09:55,170 --> 02:09:57,550
No, I'm gonna be the one who dies first.

3655
02:09:57,890 --> 02:09:59,730
It'll be your fault though, if I die.

3656
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:01,270
You're the one who's digging mine.

3657
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:05,550
You're the one who's digging my block.

3658
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:07,390
You said...

3659
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:09,850
You said alright, you wanna just do it?

3660
02:10:09,850 --> 02:10:10,410
Wait, hold on.

3661
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:13,910
Yeah, I need to make...

3662
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:14,650
Can I have some iron?

3663
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:19,930
Do you not have any iron blocks?

3664
02:10:20,110 --> 02:10:21,070
I have one left.

3665
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:22,590
Go make your own iron.

3666
02:10:23,610 --> 02:10:26,690
I have none, I only have one iron ingot.

3667
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:29,410
Go burn your iron ingot!

3668
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:30,630
It's already burned!

3669
02:10:31,650 --> 02:10:33,570
How much do you need?

3670
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:35,570
How much is a pickaxe?

3671
02:10:36,690 --> 02:10:37,570
It's like two.

3672
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:38,930
Okay, then give me one more.

3673
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:41,730
Alright, that's an I.O.U.

3674
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:42,090
right there.

3675
02:10:42,110 --> 02:10:43,370
Yeah, give me two more.

3676
02:10:44,290 --> 02:10:45,270
Oh my God.

3677
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:47,210
That's an I.O.U.

3678
02:10:47,250 --> 02:10:47,910
right there.

3679
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:49,190
Sure, yeah.

3680
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:53,310
Alright.

3681
02:10:54,190 --> 02:10:54,870
Okay, one second.

3682
02:10:55,330 --> 02:10:56,070
It's almost done.

3683
02:10:57,070 --> 02:10:59,210
We are at...

3684
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:00,430
Minus ten.

3685
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:02,830
We still have 40 more.

3686
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:06,590
Okay, I'm making my pickaxe.

3687
02:11:06,790 --> 02:11:08,230
I'm gonna eat real fast.

3688
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:10,090
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

3689
02:11:11,710 --> 02:11:12,690
Oh yeah, me too.

3690
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:16,810
What if a creeper just falls on our head because we didn't put any torches above us?

3691
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:18,550
I don't think they...I think they're smarter.

3692
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:20,290
I don't think they fall like that, right?

3693
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:26,010
I don't know anymore.

3694
02:11:26,530 --> 02:11:27,730
I don't know.

3695
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:28,930
We're at negative 11.

3696
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:30,330
What if we just strip mine from here?

3697
02:11:30,990 --> 02:11:32,750
No, it has to be negative 50.

3698
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:35,550
It said negative 50, right?

3699
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:37,130
I think so.

3700
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:42,270
They do fall in harder difficulties, but we're at hardcore.

3701
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:44,370
Hey, what the hell?

3702
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:45,830
You're trying to sabotage me.

3703
02:11:45,990 --> 02:11:46,630
No, I'm not.

3704
02:11:46,710 --> 02:11:49,050
I'm literally trying to fucking dig.

3705
02:11:49,090 --> 02:11:50,650
You literally attacked me.

3706
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:52,070
No, I didn't.

3707
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:55,050
I just stood in front of the hitbox.

3708
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:57,930
That's why I...

3709
02:11:57,930 --> 02:11:58,630
I didn't move.

3710
02:11:58,710 --> 02:11:59,850
I literally just left click.

3711
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:02,930
That's why I didn't attack the zombie at that one time.

3712
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:03,710
I didn't move.

3713
02:12:06,230 --> 02:12:07,530
Where are we at?

3714
02:12:07,690 --> 02:12:08,670
We're at negative 29.

3715
02:12:09,910 --> 02:12:10,390
Hey.

3716
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:12,010
You don't get an extra one?

3717
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:18,270
Why are you so scared?

3718
02:12:19,090 --> 02:12:21,790
Why are you so scared?

3719
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:23,810
Jump down.

3720
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:24,370
Jump down.

3721
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:24,850
Come on.

3722
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:26,110
What are you doing?

3723
02:12:26,190 --> 02:12:26,670
What happened?

3724
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:28,790
I thought you wanted to...

3725
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:30,490
You're such a fucker.

3726
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:32,670
You're actually such a fucker.

3727
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:34,670
Such a fucker.

3728
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:39,390
I hope it is a hole and we have to do this all over again.

3729
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:40,590
I hope...

3730
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:41,830
I hope it's a hole.

3731
02:12:41,970 --> 02:12:44,390
I hope it's a fucking hole.

3732
02:12:46,710 --> 02:12:48,470
You just couldn't... Come on.

3733
02:12:48,970 --> 02:12:49,530
It's all good.

3734
02:12:50,010 --> 02:12:50,430
Whatever.

3735
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:51,490
It's all good.

3736
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:55,210
I hope it's a hole and we actually dig to lava.

3737
02:12:55,410 --> 02:12:56,050
We're at negative 50.

3738
02:12:56,910 --> 02:12:57,650
Oh shit, are we?

3739
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:57,910
Yeah.

3740
02:12:58,950 --> 02:13:00,490
Oh shit, we went too far.

3741
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:02,590
No, we're good.

3742
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:02,890
We're good.

3743
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:03,210
We're good.

3744
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:05,570
No, now I'm at negative 50.

3745
02:13:05,850 --> 02:13:06,410
It doesn't...

3746
02:13:06,410 --> 02:13:08,290
It's not exactly negative 50.

3747
02:13:08,410 --> 02:13:08,950
It is.

3748
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:10,030
Yes, it is.

3749
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:11,490
That's the whole point.

3750
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:13,790
Oh, no.

3751
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:15,610
What happened?

3752
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:17,910
What happened?

3753
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:19,350
There might...

3754
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:21,950
I can't tell if this is a good thing.

3755
02:13:22,130 --> 02:13:23,570
We need to do this one together.

3756
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:24,950
Why?

3757
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:28,450
It's a mine shaft.

3758
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:29,430
Oh.

3759
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:29,570
Oh.

3760
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,790
Oh my god, okay.

3761
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:34,610
Let me make staircases real fast.

3762
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:38,730
Yeah.

3763
02:13:39,430 --> 02:13:42,330
We gotta actually work together here.

3764
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:44,030
Oh my god, okay.

3765
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:45,310
We're gonna die in that mine shaft.

3766
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:45,690
No, we're not.

3767
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,830
No, I believe.

3768
02:13:47,390 --> 02:13:47,470
Come on.

3769
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:49,110
We're gonna die in this mine shaft.

3770
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:50,970
I fucking believe in our deaths.

3771
02:13:51,250 --> 02:13:52,610
No, we have... Do you have a...

3772
02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:53,450
We need redstone?

3773
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:55,470
No, no.

3774
02:13:56,150 --> 02:13:56,570
Okay.

3775
02:13:57,910 --> 02:13:59,510
Do you have...

3776
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:00,410
Do you have a good sword?

3777
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:01,270
Do you have an iron sword?

3778
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:02,590
I have an iron sword, yeah.

3779
02:14:04,030 --> 02:14:05,110
Alright, let's go.

3780
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:08,350
And let's loot.

3781
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:09,790
Alright.

3782
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:13,170
Yeah, no, we gotta stick together, yeah.

3783
02:14:13,670 --> 02:14:15,430
We gotta watch each other's backs.

3784
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:16,770
We gotta watch each other's backs.

3785
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:18,130
You're scared.

3786
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:19,690
Maybe.

3787
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:23,930
I like how you're saying, yeah, we gotta work together, and then you disappeared.

3788
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:27,570
Come on, you gotta keep up with me.

3789
02:14:28,910 --> 02:14:30,670
I'm trying to put torches for us.

3790
02:14:30,970 --> 02:14:32,210
Oh, I got a lot of that.

3791
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:32,890
Oh, there's some iron.

3792
02:14:33,150 --> 02:14:33,370
Nice.

3793
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:34,350
Yeah, there's iron right here.

3794
02:14:34,430 --> 02:14:34,690
Nice.

3795
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:36,450
Oh, I'll get rid of that.

3796
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:38,310
I'll keep the blueberries for food.

3797
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:39,830
I can get a name tag.

3798
02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:43,250
I'm putting some stuff away from this area.

3799
02:14:44,990 --> 02:14:45,770
You know what?

3800
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:48,290
Since we're here, we have to go back to the same area anyway.

3801
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:49,730
I'm gonna put a furnace here.

3802
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:50,090
Okay.

3803
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:51,930
And start making some stuff.

3804
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:53,470
Alright.

3805
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:54,970
Oh, hey.

3806
02:14:55,470 --> 02:14:55,910
Nice.

3807
02:14:56,370 --> 02:14:56,650
Iron.

3808
02:14:58,350 --> 02:14:59,050
Oh, wait, gold.

3809
02:14:59,190 --> 02:14:59,910
We don't need gold.

3810
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:00,670
Wait, we do need gold.

3811
02:15:00,670 --> 02:15:01,090
No, we don't.

3812
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:03,190
For the piggies.

3813
02:15:04,030 --> 02:15:05,770
Oh, I guess that's true.

3814
02:15:05,770 --> 02:15:08,490
Wait, why do people give gold to the piggies again?

3815
02:15:08,630 --> 02:15:09,390
What do you get?

3816
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:12,710
You can trade with them, and sometimes they give you potions.

3817
02:15:12,910 --> 02:15:14,710
We need, like, potions of fire resistance.

3818
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:15,110
Potions?

3819
02:15:16,270 --> 02:15:18,390
Can't they give, like, ender pearls and stuff?

3820
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,230
Yeah, they give pearls.

3821
02:15:19,370 --> 02:15:22,230
They can give pearls, they can give potions, and then they can give...

3822
02:15:22,670 --> 02:15:23,270
What's it called?

3823
02:15:23,450 --> 02:15:24,310
Wait, did we come this way?

3824
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:25,710
Oh, this is the way we came from.

3825
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:27,770
They can also give... Wait, there's one over here.

3826
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:30,170
There's what?

3827
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:30,690
Right here.

3828
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:33,890
Yeah, we gotta get down here.

3829
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:34,850
Oh.

3830
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:35,570
Okay.

3831
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:37,590
You could make a staircase.

3832
02:15:39,170 --> 02:15:39,890
Yeah, but...

3833
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:40,610
But what?

3834
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:40,970
Yeah?

3835
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:42,550
Why didn't you?

3836
02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:44,670
I wanted to do it the cool way.

3837
02:15:45,890 --> 02:15:46,450
The harder way?

3838
02:15:46,450 --> 02:15:48,030
Oh, there's an iron pickaxe in here.

3839
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:49,370
You mean the harder way?

3840
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:50,350
The cool way?

3841
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:52,490
The harder way.

3842
02:15:52,590 --> 02:15:53,210
The cool way.

3843
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:55,410
Where I look cool, like I'm fearless.

3844
02:15:56,010 --> 02:15:57,530
Chat, did you think she looked cool?

3845
02:15:58,050 --> 02:15:58,370
Yeah!

3846
02:16:02,930 --> 02:16:05,330
Did she look cool just jumping down?

3847
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:05,930
Yeah!

3848
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:09,830
She looked so awesome.

3849
02:16:10,870 --> 02:16:12,090
Oh no, there's a spider!

3850
02:16:12,090 --> 02:16:13,350
So cool!

3851
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:14,950
Wait, where are you, Doki?

3852
02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:17,370
I'm... I went up.

3853
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:20,270
I think this is the entrance to the mineshaft.

3854
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:22,150
The coolest.

3855
02:16:23,390 --> 02:16:24,010
Yeah, see?

3856
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:25,370
I think I look cool.

3857
02:16:25,990 --> 02:16:27,250
Oh, maybe that's the spider I'm hearing.

3858
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:28,010
Diamond!

3859
02:16:32,710 --> 02:16:35,550
Let's see if there's more...

3860
02:16:37,950 --> 02:16:40,750
Congratulations on your one diamond.

3861
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:41,810
You needed that.

3862
02:16:41,810 --> 02:16:44,150
Oh wait, I ran out of torches.

3863
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:45,510
Two diamonds, actually.

3864
02:16:47,570 --> 02:16:49,050
Wait, why do I have two chests?

3865
02:16:49,190 --> 02:16:50,850
Did I accidentally grab your chest?

3866
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:52,350
You grabbed my chest?

3867
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:53,010
Yeah.

3868
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:54,150
Oh sorry, there's none.

3869
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:55,710
I forgot.

3870
02:16:55,970 --> 02:16:57,210
I forgot you got nerfed.

3871
02:16:59,090 --> 02:16:59,990
Says you!

3872
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:01,730
Oh my god!

3873
02:17:01,890 --> 02:17:03,550
Pot calling the kettle black!

3874
02:17:04,070 --> 02:17:04,790
For real!

3875
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:07,790
Says you!

3876
02:17:11,810 --> 02:17:14,050
I remember when somebody was spamming Doki...

3877
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:16,070
laughing at Doki board.

3878
02:17:16,410 --> 02:17:17,910
I fucking remember.

3879
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:23,710
You know, someone at a fan meet gave me a cutting board literally with your face drawn on it.

3880
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:25,170
Wait, what?!

3881
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:29,210
And the letter said, don't tell Doki, but you know what?

3882
02:17:29,650 --> 02:17:30,870
I think I will!

3883
02:17:31,170 --> 02:17:32,450
But you told!

3884
02:17:32,590 --> 02:17:33,190
You told!

3885
02:17:33,230 --> 02:17:37,150
Yeah, I think I will because it's my ammunition now.

3886
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:39,330
You can't trust her, guys.

3887
02:17:39,330 --> 02:17:41,050
You can't trust her, guys.

3888
02:17:41,350 --> 02:17:42,010
Where'd you go?

3889
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:44,610
I don't fucking know!

3890
02:17:44,990 --> 02:17:47,010
Says the guy who owns an actual...

3891
02:17:47,010 --> 02:17:51,370
Why did you give it to Mint and not me?!

3892
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:52,830
That's like...

3893
02:17:52,830 --> 02:17:54,970
That's the thing I'm wondering about.

3894
02:17:55,090 --> 02:17:56,790
Why did you give it to her?

3895
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:59,510
If it has my face on it?

3896
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:00,690
I don't know!

3897
02:18:01,570 --> 02:18:03,330
Control your words, your goons!

3898
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:07,390
Was that a mending book?

3899
02:18:07,390 --> 02:18:08,310
Oh yeah, we need...

3900
02:18:10,190 --> 02:18:11,350
Actual things, don't we?

3901
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:12,910
No, sweeping it.

3902
02:18:12,990 --> 02:18:14,130
Actually, this might be good to have.

3903
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:15,710
Where'd you go?

3904
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:16,450
I'm scared!

3905
02:18:18,090 --> 02:18:19,490
I'm all by myself!

3906
02:18:20,450 --> 02:18:21,330
Actually, I'm...

3907
02:18:21,330 --> 02:18:22,410
I think I fucked up.

3908
02:18:22,570 --> 02:18:24,230
What do you mean you fucked up?!

3909
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:26,010
I don't know where I am!

3910
02:18:26,070 --> 02:18:28,970
Where I can go even deeper?

3911
02:18:29,210 --> 02:18:30,370
No, don't go deeper!

3912
02:18:33,290 --> 02:18:34,170
I'm scared!

3913
02:18:34,170 --> 02:18:36,050
What happened to sticking together?

3914
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:38,470
I don't know, you walked off the other way.

3915
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:39,930
No, you're just too slow!

3916
02:18:40,110 --> 02:18:40,510
Oh, hi.

3917
02:18:40,970 --> 02:18:42,130
Oh, let's go down here then.

3918
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:44,190
No, I went there.

3919
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:45,730
I went all the way... I explored all of that.

3920
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:46,230
Oh, all of it?

3921
02:18:46,290 --> 02:18:46,530
Okay.

3922
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:48,990
Did you explore all of this way?

3923
02:18:49,630 --> 02:18:51,250
No, this way.

3924
02:18:51,450 --> 02:18:53,390
I didn't go any further than this though.

3925
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:55,470
Okay.

3926
02:18:56,830 --> 02:18:59,750
We gotta find our original way back, because I put a furnace there.

3927
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:02,110
Oh wait, I know where to go.

3928
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:02,850
Just let's go.

3929
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:05,030
I would like to have my furnace back.

3930
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:06,590
I have another furnace.

3931
02:19:07,010 --> 02:19:07,630
I have two furnaces.

3932
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:08,830
I know, but I put furnaces.

3933
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:10,630
I was making stuff from there.

3934
02:19:10,750 --> 02:19:12,570
There's a spider in here.

3935
02:19:12,930 --> 02:19:13,750
I can hear him.

3936
02:19:14,130 --> 02:19:14,870
Alright, let's go.

3937
02:19:20,370 --> 02:19:22,290
There must be like a...

3938
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:22,930
What is it called?

3939
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:24,310
A spawner then.

3940
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:25,750
Oh my god, that's a bat.

3941
02:19:25,950 --> 02:19:26,870
Oh my god, he scared me.

3942
02:19:26,970 --> 02:19:28,210
Oh, I'm out of torches.

3943
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:31,070
I've been out of torches for a while.

3944
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:31,750
What?

3945
02:19:31,950 --> 02:19:32,550
Why did you say something?

3946
02:19:33,310 --> 02:19:34,330
Yeah, but I've been...

3947
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:36,390
I've been using my one torch to light my way.

3948
02:19:38,050 --> 02:19:39,310
I have more torches.

3949
02:19:41,550 --> 02:19:42,230
Where are you?

3950
02:19:42,370 --> 02:19:43,150
Where am I?

3951
02:19:44,590 --> 02:19:45,310
Oh, a diamond.

3952
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:50,490
Actually, where am I?

3953
02:19:51,870 --> 02:19:52,550
Oh, a diamond.

3954
02:19:55,270 --> 02:19:56,930
What is this role reversal here?

3955
02:20:04,060 --> 02:20:08,200
I've waited for this moment for a long time.

3956
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:11,300
Oh, there's a creeper over here.

3957
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:12,220
You wanna get him?

3958
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:13,860
Sure.

3959
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:16,360
Hit and run.

3960
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:19,200
I like how you ran so far.

3961
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:21,560
Well, I'm giving you extra room.

3962
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:22,120
Duh.

3963
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:25,160
Yeah, sure, sure.

3964
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:27,420
Oh, I'm stuck.

3965
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:29,180
I can't...

3966
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:31,120
I hear a spider.

3967
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:32,040
I thought he was down here.

3968
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:32,680
I hear him.

3969
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:34,660
I think he's like somewhere in here.

3970
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:35,800
Here, hold on.

3971
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:38,260
Watch my back and I'll make more torches.

3972
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:38,900
I'll give you some.

3973
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,160
Oh, nice.

3974
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:45,180
Okay.

3975
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:46,820
Where'd you go?

3976
02:20:47,380 --> 02:20:49,300
What happened to watching my back?

3977
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:50,640
Take some torches.

3978
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:52,140
I was.

3979
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:53,180
Take these.

3980
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:54,400
Alright, nice.

3981
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:57,880
Put that here.

3982
02:20:59,320 --> 02:20:59,920
What was in here?

3983
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:00,880
Oh, what was in here?

3984
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:02,260
Oh, okay.

3985
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:04,720
I feel like we don't really need a torch or anything.

3986
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:06,320
No.

3987
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:10,950
Oh my god, where the fuck...

3988
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:12,930
I have five whole diamonds.

3989
02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:15,490
Only five?

3990
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:17,590
Well, we don't have...

3991
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:19,390
fortune pickaxes anymore.

3992
02:21:23,070 --> 02:21:24,210
This is bad.

3993
02:21:25,450 --> 02:21:27,530
I think if we...

3994
02:21:27,530 --> 02:21:29,090
Go to the left, we'll find the spawn.

3995
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:29,810
Maybe it's here.

3996
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:31,370
Maybe that's where the spiders are spawning.

3997
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:33,510
The spawner is...

3998
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:34,030
Oh, yeah.

3999
02:21:35,070 --> 02:21:36,310
Oh, that's where I found diamonds.

4000
02:21:37,650 --> 02:21:38,090
Down here?

4001
02:21:39,810 --> 02:21:41,130
No, we have gone down here.

4002
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:41,850
See, there's a torch.

4003
02:21:42,490 --> 02:21:43,370
Wait, hold on.

4004
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:48,850
Have we gone across before?

4005
02:21:49,150 --> 02:21:51,530
No, it doesn't look like it, but I want to check the...

4006
02:21:52,590 --> 02:21:53,410
Oh, hey, wait.

4007
02:21:53,550 --> 02:21:53,790
Look.

4008
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:56,190
I don't know if we have...

4009
02:21:56,190 --> 02:21:57,850
Hey, that's where the spiders are.

4010
02:21:57,990 --> 02:21:59,570
I don't know if we have gone down here.

4011
02:21:59,710 --> 02:22:00,630
I'm sure we have, but...

4012
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:01,710
No, look over here.

4013
02:22:02,170 --> 02:22:02,870
Oh, yeah, we have.

4014
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:04,970
Look over here where I am.

4015
02:22:07,410 --> 02:22:08,350
Oh my god.

4016
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:10,190
Where did he come from?

4017
02:22:10,250 --> 02:22:10,670
Over here.

4018
02:22:11,450 --> 02:22:12,530
What the fuck?

4019
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:14,910
I didn't kill him, though.

4020
02:22:14,950 --> 02:22:15,690
He's still down there.

4021
02:22:16,050 --> 02:22:16,690
That's fine.

4022
02:22:17,370 --> 02:22:18,850
Get your shields up.

4023
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:20,150
What is he gonna do?

4024
02:22:20,190 --> 02:22:20,870
Climb up?

4025
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:23,270
Uh, true.

4026
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:25,110
I'll be very impressed if he does that.

4027
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:28,650
I'll be very impressed.

4028
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:30,870
I still hear the spider, but I don't...

4029
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,470
There's nothing here.

4030
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:34,810
I'm pretty sure the spider is like...

4031
02:22:34,810 --> 02:22:35,850
Oh, there's a zombie here.

4032
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:37,690
I hear a zombie too, yeah.

4033
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:39,330
Yeah, yeah, I just killed him.

4034
02:22:39,710 --> 02:22:40,910
No, there's a different one.

4035
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:43,210
Wait, I can actually go down?

4036
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:45,650
Did he climb up?

4037
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:46,890
Did he climb up?

4038
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:49,290
Oh my god.

4039
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:51,870
Where did he come from?

4040
02:22:53,310 --> 02:22:54,790
Why are you laughing like...

4041
02:22:54,790 --> 02:22:55,630
Oh, I found the spider.

4042
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:59,290
He was guarding the diamonds.

4043
02:22:59,810 --> 02:23:01,150
All I'm saying is...

4044
02:23:01,150 --> 02:23:02,270
I have four now too.

4045
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:03,510
What?

4046
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:05,970
Oh my god.

4047
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:06,630
I have five.

4048
02:23:06,770 --> 02:23:08,230
I have five, not four.

4049
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:09,190
Just letting you know.

4050
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:14,110
Yeah, but you had to mine several times for five.

4051
02:23:14,350 --> 02:23:16,330
Hey, this is a team effort.

4052
02:23:16,330 --> 02:23:20,750
It doesn't matter how many we have as long as we...

4053
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:22,290
I have mined one square for that diamond.

4054
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:25,670
I think there's more spider here.

4055
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:28,050
Or... Oh yeah, there is.

4056
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:29,690
Spider!

4057
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:33,610
There's nothing here.

4058
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:34,550
I got him.

4059
02:23:35,330 --> 02:23:36,730
Is this where the zombie was?

4060
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:40,570
Alright, I think we got all the mines...

4061
02:23:40,570 --> 02:23:42,350
I think we explored the mineshaft fully.

4062
02:23:42,710 --> 02:23:43,830
No, we have not.

4063
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:44,570
Oh shit!

4064
02:23:44,650 --> 02:23:45,130
No, we have not.

4065
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:46,930
Wait, where are you?

4066
02:23:47,910 --> 02:23:49,490
I'm exploring the mineshaft.

4067
02:23:49,870 --> 02:23:50,950
Wait, where did you go?

4068
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:52,130
Where are you?

4069
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:53,370
I don't know.

4070
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:55,330
Well, find me.

4071
02:23:56,570 --> 02:23:57,550
Oh, I see you.

4072
02:23:58,610 --> 02:24:00,410
I was gonna say, how do I find you?

4073
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:01,130
Oh my god.

4074
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:02,630
Are you sure?

4075
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:03,710
Oh yeah, we haven't gotten here.

4076
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:04,530
I'm gonna die.

4077
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:05,530
Hold on, I gotta eat.

4078
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:07,870
How are you so close to dying?

4079
02:24:08,930 --> 02:24:10,290
We don't need gold.

4080
02:24:10,610 --> 02:24:11,650
We don't need gold.

4081
02:24:11,650 --> 02:24:11,650
No!

4082
02:24:12,110 --> 02:24:13,470
We can get ender pearls!

4083
02:24:13,990 --> 02:24:17,310
I swear to god, if we like...

4084
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:20,010
If this clutches our run, I'm gonna remember this.

4085
02:24:22,590 --> 02:24:26,070
I'm gonna remember this if this fucking clutches our run.

4086
02:24:26,750 --> 02:24:27,790
You're gonna remember this?

4087
02:24:27,930 --> 02:24:29,650
Yeah, I'm gonna remember this.

4088
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:33,430
English is not my first language.

4089
02:24:36,830 --> 02:24:39,470
It's not a first language thing, it's literally a mumbling thing!

4090
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:42,970
You're mumbling this?

4091
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:44,810
There's more over here by the way too.

4092
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:46,990
English is my first language by the way.

4093
02:24:51,330 --> 02:24:53,010
But it made you feel bad.

4094
02:24:53,770 --> 02:24:56,110
Not even a little bit, because it's you.

4095
02:24:58,190 --> 02:24:59,950
Should we just strip mine here then?

4096
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:02,390
No, I need to go back to the furnace.

4097
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:05,490
Oh my god, forget about your furnace, I have two furnaces!

4098
02:25:06,010 --> 02:25:06,110
No!

4099
02:25:06,610 --> 02:25:08,830
But it had meat in it!

4100
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:10,650
It had all my coal!

4101
02:25:10,950 --> 02:25:12,710
I had 50 coal in there!

4102
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:14,410
Why did you put all of it in there?

4103
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:15,410
Okay, fine, let's go back.

4104
02:25:15,470 --> 02:25:16,950
Because I thought we were gonna go back!

4105
02:25:17,590 --> 02:25:19,410
You said you knew how to go back!

4106
02:25:19,450 --> 02:25:21,370
Not from here, shit, I don't know.

4107
02:25:21,610 --> 02:25:22,170
Okay, hold on.

4108
02:25:22,490 --> 02:25:23,390
Wait, I think I do know.

4109
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:25,410
Okay, from down here.

4110
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:29,950
You said we were gonna go back, and I believed in you.

4111
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:32,270
I don't actually know where you left it though.

4112
02:25:33,050 --> 02:25:34,150
I don't know either.

4113
02:25:35,170 --> 02:25:36,950
What do you mean you don't know either?

4114
02:25:38,830 --> 02:25:40,810
Was it before the mineshaft?

4115
02:25:41,070 --> 02:25:45,090
Yeah, it was the mineshaft, but it was the first mineshaft area.

4116
02:25:47,550 --> 02:25:48,750
Oh, there it is!

4117
02:25:48,850 --> 02:25:50,110
See, I told you!

4118
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:53,030
Okay, now we can...

4119
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:54,710
Where are these zombie noises coming from?

4120
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:55,910
Oh yeah, two, right?

4121
02:25:56,030 --> 02:25:56,950
Okay, I'll just wait for you two.

4122
02:25:57,230 --> 02:25:58,490
Yeah, you don't need to bring your...

4123
02:25:58,490 --> 02:26:00,490
Actually, I'm gonna bring it anyway.

4124
02:26:01,170 --> 02:26:03,630
We don't need gunpowder, because then we don't need TNT, right?

4125
02:26:04,470 --> 02:26:09,630
I mean, I guess technically not, unless we want to get netherite, but...

4126
02:26:12,050 --> 02:26:13,650
No, that's too much work.

4127
02:26:13,730 --> 02:26:16,590
Do we need netherite to fucking fight the ender dragon?

4128
02:26:17,010 --> 02:26:17,390
Well...

4129
02:26:17,390 --> 02:26:18,750
We can just fight them with diamond.

4130
02:26:20,310 --> 02:26:21,370
Yeah, I guess so.

4131
02:26:22,390 --> 02:26:23,870
Like, we could just do it with diamond.

4132
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:27,290
How do you open a book?

4133
02:26:28,230 --> 02:26:29,010
What do you mean?

4134
02:26:30,030 --> 02:26:32,490
You need a thingy for it.

4135
02:26:32,490 --> 02:26:33,950
You need a thingy?

4136
02:26:34,130 --> 02:26:35,870
Yeah, like a library thing.

4137
02:26:36,390 --> 02:26:40,210
So you have to have a thingy to open to write in it too?

4138
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:43,030
Yeah, you can't open it and do anything with it.

4139
02:26:43,430 --> 02:26:45,730
Oh my God, I knew I can't read.

4140
02:26:46,730 --> 02:26:48,370
I'll never be able to read.

4141
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:49,450
Okay, let's go back downstairs.

4142
02:26:49,650 --> 02:26:50,770
Oh my God, you scared me.

4143
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:51,630
Oh,

4144
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,450
this is where you got your diamond.

4145
02:26:58,590 --> 02:27:00,850
Well, let's go keep... This is a good diamond area then.

4146
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:02,550
Yeah, yeah, so we just trip mine.

4147
02:27:02,770 --> 02:27:03,310
Trip mine.

4148
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:05,150
Alright, nice.

4149
02:27:07,490 --> 02:27:08,290
This is it.

4150
02:27:08,750 --> 02:27:10,970
This is where we're gonna find all the diamonds.

4151
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:13,790
We're gonna find diamond, we're gonna be so dripped out.

4152
02:27:13,790 --> 02:27:15,950
We're gonna be so rich and everything.

4153
02:27:16,070 --> 02:27:16,530
You know what?

4154
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:20,850
I'm gonna use that diamond I have now...

4155
02:27:21,370 --> 02:27:23,470
And craft a diamond pickaxe.

4156
02:27:23,550 --> 02:27:23,750
What?

4157
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:24,230
I'm gonna do it.

4158
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:25,510
That's such a waste.

4159
02:27:25,610 --> 02:27:27,050
I have... What do you mean?

4160
02:27:27,190 --> 02:27:28,830
We literally... That's the whole point.

4161
02:27:28,830 --> 02:27:31,650
The point is to have the diamond armor.

4162
02:27:31,750 --> 02:27:33,430
Why don't we just keep using the iron?

4163
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:39,780
You crafted it, didn't you?

4164
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:02,580
It's important!

4165
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:06,860
It's gonna do so well.

4166
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:08,320
It's gonna do so well.

4167
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:11,660
I'm gonna find the remaining diamonds for you.

4168
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:12,680
You'll see.

4169
02:28:13,140 --> 02:28:14,080
You're gonna see.

4170
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,100
You'll all see.

4171
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:16,020
You'll see.

4172
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:17,180
You'll all see.

4173
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:19,000
You're gonna see.

4174
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:22,580
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

4175
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,620
Do it!

4176
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:25,820
Prove me wrong!

4177
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:28,620
You'll see.

4178
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:31,360
I'm gonna show you all.

4179
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:33,440
Show you all.

4180
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:38,780
Didn't they add a new enemy to the caves?

4181
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:39,360
They did?

4182
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:40,560
No, they didn't.

4183
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:41,560
I thought they did.

4184
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:42,480
What did they add?

4185
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:44,540
I don't remember what it's called.

4186
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:50,920
I don't... Chat, what was it called?

4187
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:52,860
Oh, it's a new biome?

4188
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:55,840
I thought there was a... Yeah, like a Slenderman thing, right?

4189
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:56,840
What?

4190
02:28:59,140 --> 02:29:01,020
What the fuck are you talking about?

4191
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:02,020
Not the warden.

4192
02:29:02,060 --> 02:29:02,520
The creaking?

4193
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:05,000
Yeah.

4194
02:29:05,460 --> 02:29:06,100
Is it in this?

4195
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:08,580
Only a certain cave biome.

4196
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:12,200
Wait, is it in this one?

4197
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,200
What's this one?

4198
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:16,320
Isn't this snapshot?

4199
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:18,280
Or like...

4200
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:20,660
Deep dark!

4201
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:21,740
Deep dark!

4202
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:23,480
You got the deep dark?

4203
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:24,840
I'm in the deep dark!

4204
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:27,500
How the fuck did you find...

4205
02:29:31,650 --> 02:29:32,510
Well, I don't know.

4206
02:29:32,590 --> 02:29:33,630
It might not be a...

4207
02:29:33,630 --> 02:29:35,150
It might not be a city.

4208
02:29:36,370 --> 02:29:36,890
Wait, no.

4209
02:29:37,030 --> 02:29:38,210
You can tell if it's a city.

4210
02:29:38,610 --> 02:29:39,010
F3.

4211
02:29:39,210 --> 02:29:40,090
It tells you the biome.

4212
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:42,150
No, it says my biome is deep dark.

4213
02:29:43,490 --> 02:29:45,730
Oh, if you dig down, that means we're in it.

4214
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:51,310
Are you gonna dig down?

4215
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:52,310
Should I dig down?

4216
02:29:53,810 --> 02:29:54,210
Okay.

4217
02:29:54,930 --> 02:29:55,570
Are you gonna do it?

4218
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:58,010
If we find a warden, we are actually for sure dead.

4219
02:29:58,190 --> 02:29:58,790
What do you mean, we?

4220
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:01,170
Oh, wait.

4221
02:30:01,230 --> 02:30:02,590
I'm at bedrock when I dig down.

4222
02:30:02,590 --> 02:30:03,670
Wait, I'm at bedrock too.

4223
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:04,890
I've been digging bedrock.

4224
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:07,890
I was trying to dig bedrock.

4225
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:10,390
I couldn't tell.

4226
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:13,310
I couldn't tell that I was bedrock.

4227
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:14,430
Toki.

4228
02:30:14,850 --> 02:30:18,330
I was like, wow, this is some hard-ass rock right here.

4229
02:30:18,830 --> 02:30:24,490
You're wasting your newly diamond pickaxe.

4230
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:29,130
I was like, whoa, this rock is so hard to dig.

4231
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:30,570
Is this really deep dark?

4232
02:30:30,670 --> 02:30:31,870
There's no skulk at all.

4233
02:30:33,690 --> 02:30:35,190
Maybe I dig down or above.

4234
02:30:35,390 --> 02:30:36,270
Maybe it's above us.

4235
02:30:36,350 --> 02:30:37,270
Maybe it's above us.

4236
02:30:37,570 --> 02:30:40,470
Yeah, I think it is because we're too far deep for...

4237
02:30:40,470 --> 02:30:42,630
We're too far deep for it to be.

4238
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:44,490
Yeah, it doesn't matter for us.

4239
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:47,130
Yeah, we don't need...

4240
02:30:47,130 --> 02:30:49,690
I don't think we need it, so...

4241
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:52,630
I don't think there was anything there that requires us to...

4242
02:30:54,990 --> 02:30:55,950
To... What was it?

4243
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:59,790
Nah, it would probably just be a flex to say that we survived the deep dark.

4244
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:02,650
I mean, technically, I'm surviving the deep dark right now.

4245
02:31:02,770 --> 02:31:03,390
In hardcore.

4246
02:31:03,770 --> 02:31:05,010
I'm surviving... Oh, diamond.

4247
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:08,650
Oh, diamond.

4248
02:31:08,650 --> 02:31:09,350
Whoa!

4249
02:31:10,530 --> 02:31:11,930
Hey, I got diamond too.

4250
02:31:12,130 --> 02:31:13,630
See, I told you it was an investment.

4251
02:31:14,990 --> 02:31:15,390
One.

4252
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:16,210
Two.

4253
02:31:16,490 --> 02:31:16,850
Yeah, two.

4254
02:31:17,210 --> 02:31:17,390
Okay.

4255
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:18,590
Yeah, how many did you get?

4256
02:31:18,790 --> 02:31:19,770
I got like five.

4257
02:31:20,350 --> 02:31:20,950
Oh, okay.

4258
02:31:21,250 --> 02:31:22,310
I'm at eleven now.

4259
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:23,130
I have eleven diamonds.

4260
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:24,390
Oh, okay.

4261
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:26,650
I mean, I got my diamond pickaxe.

4262
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:32,010
Actually, I think we do need that for like obsidian.

4263
02:31:33,090 --> 02:31:33,490
Yeah.

4264
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:34,390
Oh, yeah?

4265
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:36,730
Oh, so my investment was like corrected.

4266
02:31:37,710 --> 02:31:38,070
Barely.

4267
02:31:38,170 --> 02:31:39,410
I mean, we could've found obsidian.

4268
02:31:40,890 --> 02:31:43,930
We could've also like made it without the obsidian, you know?

4269
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:45,370
Sure, sure, sure.

4270
02:31:45,710 --> 02:31:46,030
Yeah.

4271
02:31:46,170 --> 02:31:46,750
Are you crying?

4272
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:47,350
Are you okay?

4273
02:31:47,630 --> 02:31:47,850
Yeah.

4274
02:31:49,070 --> 02:31:50,190
Why would I be crying?

4275
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:51,970
I have my diamond pickaxe.

4276
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:53,250
My good investment.

4277
02:31:53,490 --> 02:31:54,290
Your good investment.

4278
02:31:57,130 --> 02:31:58,390
Wait, we could just use the bucket.

4279
02:31:58,550 --> 02:31:59,290
Wait, that's actually...

4280
02:31:59,290 --> 02:32:00,110
That's what I'm saying.

4281
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:02,910
You use the bucket to like make it without the...

4282
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:04,050
Yeah, do you know how to do it?

4283
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:04,890
Do you know how to do it?

4284
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:06,510
I actually don't know how.

4285
02:32:06,790 --> 02:32:07,550
Yeah, exactly.

4286
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:08,310
Exactly.

4287
02:32:10,490 --> 02:32:12,530
I actually think I'm stupid with that.

4288
02:32:12,850 --> 02:32:13,770
I never looked it up.

4289
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:16,990
Wait, your video tutorial didn't tell you how to?

4290
02:32:17,230 --> 02:32:17,530
No.

4291
02:32:18,510 --> 02:32:20,250
I told you, they don't hold your hand.

4292
02:32:20,390 --> 02:32:22,230
They're like, you're gonna figure this out.

4293
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:24,410
We'll just give you hints on what to do.

4294
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:28,330
Wait, I need to go up.

4295
02:32:28,910 --> 02:32:29,490
Let's see.

4296
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:32,830
How the turns of tables, right everybody?

4297
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:36,790
I feel like we need to be at... Isn't 54 like the optimal?

4298
02:32:37,750 --> 02:32:38,610
I don't know.

4299
02:32:38,810 --> 02:32:39,990
I'm at negative 58.

4300
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:41,970
You're at 58?

4301
02:32:42,490 --> 02:32:44,050
Is that almost bedrock?

4302
02:32:45,030 --> 02:32:45,270
Yeah.

4303
02:32:48,050 --> 02:32:49,450
This sounds like cope, huh?

4304
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:53,490
Oh, I don't think I'm at the right level for me to be getting diamond, you know?

4305
02:32:54,130 --> 02:32:55,470
I'm gonna remember this.

4306
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:58,050
Oh, I have!

4307
02:32:58,350 --> 02:33:00,790
Toki, I have remembered it!

4308
02:33:00,790 --> 02:33:03,130
At least people are gonna remember what you...

4309
02:33:06,570 --> 02:33:08,870
I have remembered it!

4310
02:33:09,210 --> 02:33:13,650
Through the afterlife, I have literally remembered this.

4311
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:21,110
People always remember the first time, not the second.

4312
02:33:24,410 --> 02:33:26,430
It is my first time.

4313
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:42,810
How many diamonds do we need, guys, for a full armor set?

4314
02:33:46,530 --> 02:33:47,350
How many?

4315
02:33:48,410 --> 02:33:49,690
I'm surprised I haven't hit anything.

4316
02:33:50,010 --> 02:33:51,150
Oh, I hate this eerie sound.

4317
02:33:51,250 --> 02:33:51,770
It's so creepy.

4318
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:53,470
33?

4319
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:56,690
I feel like I've been digging for the rest of my life.

4320
02:33:57,010 --> 02:33:58,110
We need 30?

4321
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:59,410
We need 30?

4322
02:33:59,610 --> 02:34:00,610
Someone says 24.

4323
02:34:00,850 --> 02:34:01,210
24.

4324
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,890
Okay, people are gaslighting me.

4325
02:34:04,350 --> 02:34:05,610
24 for armor.

4326
02:34:06,010 --> 02:34:12,830
Your whisper gaslighting you, but my dragoons instantly told me the correct amount.

4327
02:34:13,150 --> 02:34:15,550
Oh, but we also need a sword.

4328
02:34:15,870 --> 02:34:17,770
I think they meant it with also the sword.

4329
02:34:19,190 --> 02:34:19,710
Right?

4330
02:34:19,830 --> 02:34:20,970
We need the sword too.

4331
02:34:22,170 --> 02:34:23,130
Uh-oh, I hear lava.

4332
02:34:24,990 --> 02:34:25,730
You hear lava?

4333
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:32,890
That was one guy doki as well.

4334
02:34:33,610 --> 02:34:35,430
No, that was several people!

4335
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:39,570
There were several dragoons that said it!

4336
02:34:39,950 --> 02:34:41,410
Oh, you don't even see my chat.

4337
02:34:41,570 --> 02:34:44,010
Like, how are you gaslighting me when you don't even see my chat?

4338
02:34:44,490 --> 02:34:44,510
Oh no!

4339
02:34:45,050 --> 02:34:46,530
Wait, do you have a crafting table?

4340
02:34:47,250 --> 02:34:47,830
Yeah, I do.

4341
02:34:47,970 --> 02:34:48,370
I have two.

4342
02:34:48,810 --> 02:34:49,370
Can I have one?

4343
02:34:49,410 --> 02:34:50,330
Oh, I think you stole mine.

4344
02:34:51,210 --> 02:34:52,050
I didn't steal it.

4345
02:34:52,090 --> 02:34:52,970
You lost yours.

4346
02:34:53,330 --> 02:34:54,650
I'm running back to you.

4347
02:34:55,170 --> 02:34:56,290
How far are you?

4348
02:34:57,130 --> 02:34:59,070
You're going down one hole, right?

4349
02:34:59,250 --> 02:35:00,430
You're just going down a single hole?

4350
02:35:00,530 --> 02:35:02,170
Oh my gosh, you switched directions.

4351
02:35:02,170 --> 02:35:04,170
Did you not hear when I said I hit bedrock?

4352
02:35:05,270 --> 02:35:07,250
You can keep going!

4353
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:09,130
No, you can't!

4354
02:35:09,270 --> 02:35:10,610
I'm just going straight!

4355
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:13,610
Is that incapable of you?

4356
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:15,330
Are you incapable of going straight?

4357
02:35:16,690 --> 02:35:18,330
Oh hey, look, I found...

4358
02:35:20,850 --> 02:35:22,690
Give me my crafting table.

4359
02:35:22,710 --> 02:35:24,650
I found five diamonds.

4360
02:35:24,650 --> 02:35:26,230
That's right.

4361
02:35:26,590 --> 02:35:27,810
Give me my crafting table.

4362
02:35:29,850 --> 02:35:30,330
Yes.

4363
02:35:30,910 --> 02:35:32,290
No, you gotta find me first.

4364
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:34,070
I'm literally right behind you.

4365
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:35,370
Oh hey.

4366
02:35:39,050 --> 02:35:41,450
Stupid crafting table.

4367
02:35:42,630 --> 02:35:43,370
Look at that.

4368
02:35:44,050 --> 02:35:44,990
Okay, thank you.

4369
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:47,850
That was a stack of six diamonds?

4370
02:35:48,410 --> 02:35:49,470
Look at that.

4371
02:35:49,610 --> 02:35:50,330
How many do you have?

4372
02:35:51,650 --> 02:35:53,190
Um, seven.

4373
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:58,410
And if I include the, you know, the two diamonds, the three diamonds I used to make my diamond pickaxe...

4374
02:35:58,990 --> 02:36:00,510
That would be like ten.

4375
02:36:01,810 --> 02:36:03,570
Yeah, that's rookies numbers.

4376
02:36:04,110 --> 02:36:07,210
Yeah, well you have eleven, like the plus one that's apparently better.

4377
02:36:07,570 --> 02:36:08,730
Yeah, eleven.

4378
02:36:09,790 --> 02:36:10,510
I didn't take it?

4379
02:36:11,170 --> 02:36:12,970
Oh, I didn't take it.

4380
02:36:13,170 --> 02:36:13,330
Oops.

4381
02:36:14,650 --> 02:36:16,530
Yeah, see, you lost yours and you're like...

4382
02:36:18,290 --> 02:36:23,410
You stole my crafting table when you didn't even take your crafting table in the first place.

4383
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:24,270
I can't see.

4384
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:25,910
You don't put any torches down.

4385
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:27,050
It's pitch black down here.

4386
02:36:27,770 --> 02:36:29,290
Yeah, I don't need torches.

4387
02:36:29,450 --> 02:36:31,530
I literally have a torch in my hand to light the way.

4388
02:36:32,030 --> 02:36:36,350
Why waste resources when I can just light the way with my torches in my hand?

4389
02:36:36,510 --> 02:36:39,010
I can't wait for a creeper to spawn right up behind you.

4390
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:44,970
And I want you to eat those words.

4391
02:36:44,970 --> 02:36:45,390
Do it!

4392
02:36:45,690 --> 02:36:46,650
Do it now!

4393
02:36:48,170 --> 02:36:49,370
Spawn in now.

4394
02:36:49,490 --> 02:36:50,230
I ain't scared.

4395
02:36:51,110 --> 02:36:52,490
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

4396
02:36:52,870 --> 02:36:54,230
Yeah, I ain't afraid of no ghost.

4397
02:36:54,330 --> 02:36:55,950
There's literally a ghost right beside me.

4398
02:36:56,730 --> 02:36:57,450
I'm gone.

4399
02:36:57,630 --> 02:36:58,330
I'm long gone.

4400
02:36:58,550 --> 02:36:58,590
She's not scared.

4401
02:36:58,850 --> 02:36:59,650
I'm long gone.

4402
02:36:59,690 --> 02:37:00,450
She's not scary.

4403
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:02,190
I am scary.

4404
02:37:02,510 --> 02:37:03,150
What are you talking about?

4405
02:37:03,710 --> 02:37:03,710
You're not.

4406
02:37:03,710 --> 02:37:04,750
You're not fucking scary.

4407
02:37:04,830 --> 02:37:06,170
You've never scared anybody in your life.

4408
02:37:06,210 --> 02:37:07,010
Yes, I have!

4409
02:37:07,450 --> 02:37:07,790
You have.

4410
02:37:07,890 --> 02:37:08,870
Yes, I have!

4411
02:37:08,990 --> 02:37:09,270
Name one.

4412
02:37:09,270 --> 02:37:09,790
Name one.

4413
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:11,250
You wanna watch me scare them right now?

4414
02:37:12,030 --> 02:37:12,430
Yeah.

4415
02:37:12,570 --> 02:37:13,430
I'm graduating.

4416
02:37:21,130 --> 02:37:21,830
I'm graduating.

4417
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:22,470
We've already done worse.

4418
02:37:26,490 --> 02:37:27,410
That's it?

4419
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:28,670
It's a joke, guys.

4420
02:37:28,750 --> 02:37:29,370
It's a joke.

4421
02:37:29,450 --> 02:37:30,490
They're all sad now.

4422
02:37:30,630 --> 02:37:31,990
They're all really spooked right now.

4423
02:37:32,110 --> 02:37:32,690
They're like...

4424
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:34,430
They're like PTSD.

4425
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:40,050
Too far.

4426
02:37:40,050 --> 02:37:40,830
It's a joke.

4427
02:37:41,170 --> 02:37:41,830
Too far.

4428
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:42,410
JK.

4429
02:37:42,570 --> 02:37:42,930
JK.

4430
02:37:43,430 --> 02:37:44,810
She's a monster.

4431
02:37:51,370 --> 02:37:52,770
I scared you guys.

4432
02:37:55,610 --> 02:37:56,330
Halloween's over.

4433
02:38:00,610 --> 02:38:01,390
Oh my God.

4434
02:38:01,450 --> 02:38:03,170
Why am I getting redstone?

4435
02:38:03,330 --> 02:38:03,530
Okay.

4436
02:38:06,050 --> 02:38:08,870
When you get redstone, does it give you experience?

4437
02:38:09,050 --> 02:38:09,750
Yeah, it does.

4438
02:38:09,830 --> 02:38:10,150
Oh, yeah.

4439
02:38:10,270 --> 02:38:10,770
Then mine it.

4440
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:11,810
You don't have to take it.

4441
02:38:11,850 --> 02:38:12,390
Just mine it.

4442
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:15,010
Why should I?

4443
02:38:15,210 --> 02:38:16,670
I'm already level 11.

4444
02:38:16,870 --> 02:38:19,390
Because we need it to enchant our stuff.

4445
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:20,530
We need more experience.

4446
02:38:21,990 --> 02:38:22,550
Fine.

4447
02:38:23,010 --> 02:38:23,350
God!

4448
02:38:25,650 --> 02:38:26,210
Fine.

4449
02:38:26,910 --> 02:38:27,470
Fine.

4450
02:38:27,550 --> 02:38:29,330
I guess I'll do it.

4451
02:38:29,370 --> 02:38:30,730
Can I do anything with this bamboo?

4452
02:38:32,370 --> 02:38:33,270
You can make sugar.

4453
02:38:34,290 --> 02:38:35,690
I can only make one block.

4454
02:38:35,810 --> 02:38:36,450
That's sugar cane.

4455
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:37,350
You can make paper.

4456
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:40,190
I'm making sticks.

4457
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:42,470
Making sticks.

4458
02:38:42,910 --> 02:38:43,430
Nice.

4459
02:38:44,230 --> 02:38:45,430
I'm making...

4460
02:38:45,430 --> 02:38:46,650
I'm strip mining.

4461
02:38:46,810 --> 02:38:47,610
I'm strip mining.

4462
02:38:47,730 --> 02:38:48,670
I'm stripping.

4463
02:38:49,050 --> 02:38:49,630
You're stripping?

4464
02:38:49,810 --> 02:38:50,390
She's stripping?

4465
02:38:50,850 --> 02:38:51,590
I'm stripping.

4466
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:53,650
That's like the short form for strip mining, right?

4467
02:38:53,870 --> 02:38:54,130
Yeah.

4468
02:38:54,710 --> 02:38:55,170
Yeah.

4469
02:38:55,670 --> 02:38:56,690
We're all stripping.

4470
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:57,550
We're stripping.

4471
02:38:57,550 --> 02:38:58,230
You're stripping.

4472
02:38:58,410 --> 02:38:59,350
I'm stripping.

4473
02:38:59,550 --> 02:39:00,230
Will that be enough?

4474
02:39:00,410 --> 02:39:00,770
I wonder.

4475
02:39:03,130 --> 02:39:04,010
Let's strip mining.

4476
02:39:04,170 --> 02:39:04,530
Is that what it means?

4477
02:39:04,530 --> 02:39:04,790
We're stripping.

4478
02:39:05,110 --> 02:39:05,650
We're stripping.

4479
02:39:05,970 --> 02:39:06,670
We're stripping.

4480
02:39:06,890 --> 02:39:07,730
We're doing it.

4481
02:39:08,850 --> 02:39:10,510
We're stripping so fast.

4482
02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:15,730
I'm cooking now.

4483
02:39:15,850 --> 02:39:19,230
If we die during this run, I swear to god.

4484
02:39:19,590 --> 02:39:21,790
I don't think I can do this again.

4485
02:39:22,530 --> 02:39:23,730
What are you talking about?

4486
02:39:23,930 --> 02:39:25,850
We're so much more experienced now.

4487
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:27,370
We could do it in like half the time.

4488
02:39:27,390 --> 02:39:29,370
I don't think I can start stripping again, man.

4489
02:39:29,730 --> 02:39:30,730
I hate this.

4490
02:39:31,330 --> 02:39:34,370
Actually, I don't mind the stripping because it's kind of relaxing.

4491
02:39:34,370 --> 02:39:35,570
You don't mind the stripping?

4492
02:39:36,890 --> 02:39:40,870
It's kind of relaxing to just, you know, not worry about...

4493
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:42,970
Especially when they give you superchats while you're stripping.

4494
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:44,510
They don't do that.

4495
02:39:45,050 --> 02:39:45,950
They don't do that?

4496
02:39:46,130 --> 02:39:47,910
Are you stripping for free?

4497
02:39:49,250 --> 02:39:50,810
I mean, it's like a hobby.

4498
02:39:54,910 --> 02:39:57,310
It's just a stress reliever.

4499
02:39:59,910 --> 02:40:00,930
It's like a hobby.

4500
02:40:01,110 --> 02:40:02,350
I'm just like, you know...

4501
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:05,210
Do it for experience, you know?

4502
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:07,610
I lose myself in the strip, you know?

4503
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:10,250
I don't think about it.

4504
02:40:10,290 --> 02:40:11,830
My mind just goes like blank.

4505
02:40:11,970 --> 02:40:13,270
And I just say, I'm gonna keep stripping.

4506
02:40:18,490 --> 02:40:20,530
Before I know it, I've...

4507
02:40:21,410 --> 02:40:23,790
Mint, I swear to god.

4508
02:40:23,890 --> 02:40:24,350
Mint, please.

4509
02:40:24,470 --> 02:40:25,010
I swear to god.

4510
02:40:25,130 --> 02:40:27,010
I can't keep stripping, Mint.

4511
02:40:27,130 --> 02:40:27,810
I'm okay.

4512
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:28,650
I'm okay.

4513
02:40:29,070 --> 02:40:29,770
I'm okay.

4514
02:40:30,490 --> 02:40:32,610
I've hit lava, but I'm okay.

4515
02:40:34,790 --> 02:40:38,850
Thanks guys for the dollar bills while I'm stripping.

4516
02:40:40,750 --> 02:40:42,210
Yeah, where's your dollar bills?

4517
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:44,330
Oh, hey, hey.

4518
02:40:44,410 --> 02:40:45,610
Have you hit diamond, Mint?

4519
02:40:45,970 --> 02:40:47,030
Have you hit diamond?

4520
02:40:47,970 --> 02:40:52,820
No one remembers the first time.

4521
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:54,520
Nobody remembers the second time, okay?

4522
02:40:55,340 --> 02:40:59,720
Yeah, and that's why people always remember our first experience.

4523
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:02,960
It wasn't my experience.

4524
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:05,420
This is all original right here.

4525
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:09,800
This never happened before.

4526
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:15,000
Actually, you know, I never played Minecraft before.

4527
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:19,880
Yeah, you never played Minecraft before, then how come you knew so much about stripping?

4528
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,040
Thanks for the dollar bills, guys.

4529
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:24,180
I really appreciate it.

4530
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:24,760
I worked so hard.

4531
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:26,680
Oh my gosh, thanks for the dollar bills.

4532
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:28,000
Thank you, guys.

4533
02:41:28,060 --> 02:41:29,920
Thank you for the dollar bills.

4534
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:30,520
Thank you.

4535
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:31,880
I'm stripping.

4536
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:32,700
I'm stripping.

4537
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:34,980
Well, it's not a hobby anymore.

4538
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:35,980
They're paying you.

4539
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:37,620
No, it's...

4540
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:40,580
What is it called then?

4541
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,320
It's called... I don't know.

4542
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:47,860
Do I need to get... Oh no, do I need to LLC this strip?

4543
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:52,560
Oh no, now you gotta make sure it's taxed properly.

4544
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:56,500
Gotta add the GMT taxes, guys.

4545
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:57,580
That's a Canadian tax.

4546
02:41:57,600 --> 02:41:59,080
YouTube's not gonna like this.

4547
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:08,960
YouTube, they're already thinking of... They're already pressing the button on banning our accounts at this very moment.

4548
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:10,080
Banning accounts?

4549
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:10,940
What did we do wrong?

4550
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:11,700
We're just stripping.

4551
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:14,800
Yeah, but YouTube... For money.

4552
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:16,180
For money.

4553
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:18,680
Yeah, for money, guys.

4554
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:19,520
Not legal.

4555
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:20,920
We're just strip mining.

4556
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:27,020
It's not legal, guys.

4557
02:42:27,620 --> 02:42:29,140
It's not against your TOS.

4558
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:31,000
Did you just say it's not legal?

4559
02:42:31,320 --> 02:42:31,800
That's... That means...

4560
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:32,480
It's not illegal.

4561
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:33,380
Oh, not illegal.

4562
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:35,220
Yeah, yeah.

4563
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:39,420
We're just strip mining.

4564
02:42:40,040 --> 02:42:41,000
Oh my gosh.

4565
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:45,800
Did you see like the Twitch TOS about like VTuber hips?

4566
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:46,720
Yeah.

4567
02:42:47,380 --> 02:42:48,500
I thought that was funny.

4568
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:53,660
Well, I mean, it's fucking sucks, but like... I thought that was funny because like...

4569
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:55,560
I played like Nikkei.

4570
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:57,120
I got sponsored for Nikkei.

4571
02:42:57,400 --> 02:42:59,520
And then I was like, you know, the girls.

4572
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:04,060
But it doesn't... It's fine.

4573
02:43:04,120 --> 02:43:07,620
The TOS is... If it's like a game character or something.

4574
02:43:08,420 --> 02:43:09,120
Oh my God.

4575
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:10,660
But we're not real, though.

4576
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:11,740
We're not real.

4577
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:13,900
I'm... What if we were in a game?

4578
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:14,820
I made a game.

4579
02:43:14,960 --> 02:43:16,140
And you were in the game, too.

4580
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:18,360
Technically, we're video game characters.

4581
02:43:18,380 --> 02:43:19,500
Yeah, we are video game characters.

4582
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:23,160
I mean, we're not Twitch streamers, but like, technically, like...

4583
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:24,840
If we were, we'd be fine.

4584
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:26,020
Yeah, we'd be fine.

4585
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:26,940
We'll be within TOS.

4586
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:28,000
Yeah.

4587
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:29,400
Yeah.

4588
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:33,280
Someone was just like, my mom asked me what I am watching.

4589
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:36,460
Because we keep saying we're stripping.

4590
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:42,360
We're Minecraft friendly VTubers.

4591
02:43:42,620 --> 02:43:43,340
We're playing Minecraft.

4592
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:44,600
Don't worry, mom.

4593
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:45,060
Mom, it's okay.

4594
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:45,720
Don't worry.

4595
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:49,980
Just say like... Just say it's like the new name for mining.

4596
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:52,140
They don't know what strip mining is?

4597
02:43:52,820 --> 02:43:53,420
Oh wait, they do.

4598
02:43:53,500 --> 02:43:55,040
That's like a not a Minecraft thing.

4599
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:55,860
Yeah.

4600
02:43:56,100 --> 02:43:57,460
It's not a Minecraft exclusive.

4601
02:43:57,640 --> 02:43:58,660
Like, it's not... Yeah!

4602
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:02,360
Do you think mining was invented in Minecraft?

4603
02:44:02,740 --> 02:44:03,040
Yeah.

4604
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:04,280
I can't believe it, guys.

4605
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:05,820
Mining was invented in Minecraft.

4606
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:08,200
JohnMinecraft invented mining, obviously.

4607
02:44:08,360 --> 02:44:09,460
Oh my God, you're right.

4608
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:12,480
Oh my God, someone was saying I'm watching miners.

4609
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:13,940
No, guys, don't say that.

4610
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:18,920
No, no, no, no, no, no!

4611
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:25,380
Donkey, the bit is getting too dangerous.

4612
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:26,540
Oh no, okay.

4613
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:27,420
Alright, guys.

4614
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:29,540
Alright, show's over.

4615
02:44:29,820 --> 02:44:31,980
Show's over, we're closing down.

4616
02:44:32,380 --> 02:44:33,560
The bit is getting too dangerous.

4617
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:37,580
We're changing businesses and hobbies.

4618
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:40,740
Yeah.

4619
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:44,560
Oh my God, there's so much redstone.

4620
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,620
Wait, how much do we need again?

4621
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:47,700
For redstone?

4622
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:50,020
No, like, no, like diamond.

4623
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:53,240
Diamond was, uh, twenty...

4624
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:55,260
I hear zombies next to me.

4625
02:44:56,520 --> 02:44:57,300
Twenty-seven?

4626
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:58,420
I think?

4627
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:01,740
Well, twenty-four is for the armor, and then it's three for...

4628
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:04,640
For, uh...

4629
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,740
Oh my gosh, I hate...

4630
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:08,520
Twenty-four for armor.

4631
02:45:08,620 --> 02:45:09,760
Okay, I already have the boots.

4632
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:12,280
You made boots?

4633
02:45:12,940 --> 02:45:13,840
Yeah, I already made the boots.

4634
02:45:14,180 --> 02:45:14,520
Okay.

4635
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:15,740
I'm almost done.

4636
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:18,260
That's a bit of a stretch.

4637
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:21,860
Well, I'm almost... That's like one out of four!

4638
02:45:23,140 --> 02:45:24,540
That's twenty-five percent.

4639
02:45:24,880 --> 02:45:25,500
It's not even fifty.

4640
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:28,000
That's almost... Okay, do you have any boots?

4641
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:28,820
I don't think so.

4642
02:45:29,720 --> 02:45:30,840
I don't think you have diamond boots.

4643
02:45:31,280 --> 02:45:32,620
I haven't made diamond anything.

4644
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:33,460
Exactly.

4645
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:35,460
I'm saving until I have the full...

4646
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:36,520
Exactly.

4647
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:38,020
Full set, baby.

4648
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:39,320
The full set.

4649
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:41,920
Yep, and then a zombie is gonna fucking get you.

4650
02:45:42,840 --> 02:45:45,060
Why are you wishing death upon me?

4651
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:47,320
No, I'm not wishing death upon you.

4652
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:50,680
I'm trying to tell you that you're not playing it safe.

4653
02:45:50,860 --> 02:45:52,440
I don't even have pants on right now.

4654
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:55,380
In public?

4655
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:57,500
Well, I'm in a cave.

4656
02:45:57,680 --> 02:45:58,560
Is this truly public?

4657
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:04,060
I mean, your wisp is here, surrounding you.

4658
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:05,200
Are they?

4659
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:06,620
Where are you guys?

4660
02:46:06,780 --> 02:46:07,260
Guys?

4661
02:46:07,440 --> 02:46:07,860
Guys?

4662
02:46:07,860 --> 02:46:10,380
I mean, they're ghosts, so you can't see them.

4663
02:46:10,480 --> 02:46:11,300
I'm a ghost too.

4664
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:12,460
You think ghosts can see other ghosts?

4665
02:46:12,740 --> 02:46:13,500
Yes, we can.

4666
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:14,880
How do you know that?

4667
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:16,400
Because I can see other ghosts.

4668
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:16,640
Have you seen another ghost?

4669
02:46:16,880 --> 02:46:17,120
Yeah.

4670
02:46:17,260 --> 02:46:18,140
Have you seen another ghost?

4671
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:18,400
Who?

4672
02:46:18,620 --> 02:46:18,620
Yes, I have.

4673
02:46:18,700 --> 02:46:18,940
Yes.

4674
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:21,940
I've seen many ghosts.

4675
02:46:22,820 --> 02:46:23,260
Who?

4676
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:25,360
I met George Washington.

4677
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:27,520
And what the... Oh, yeah?

4678
02:46:27,720 --> 02:46:28,640
What does he look like?

4679
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:30,100
He has...

4680
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:31,220
What's his middle name?

4681
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:33,920
I don't know.

4682
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:35,300
How... What do we... Wait.

4683
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:37,240
Oh, so you didn't actually, like, meet him.

4684
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:40,060
What's my... OK, Doki, what's my middle name, huh?

4685
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:41,740
I don't know.

4686
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:42,420
I haven't met you.

4687
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:43,240
You literally...

4688
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:47,020
What do you call this?

4689
02:46:47,020 --> 02:46:48,600
I'll know your middle name next week.

4690
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:50,140
What do you call this?

4691
02:46:50,140 --> 02:46:51,640
This is a phone call.

4692
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:53,240
This is a phone call.

4693
02:46:53,380 --> 02:46:54,980
It's not like I actually met you.

4694
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,720
It's like... It's like a seance, you know?

4695
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:03,020
Like...

4696
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:08,960
Good amount of diamond and redstone all together.

4697
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:10,860
Oh, my God.

4698
02:47:10,900 --> 02:47:11,760
I hit level 15.

4699
02:47:11,860 --> 02:47:12,300
Let's go.

4700
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:15,600
Just level 15?

4701
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:16,800
What level are you?

4702
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:17,960
16.

4703
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:20,580
Wow.

4704
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:24,420
I remember when you were saying that about my...

4705
02:47:24,420 --> 02:47:25,700
OK, but that's levels.

4706
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:26,740
That's levels.

4707
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:28,920
OK, fine then.

4708
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:30,840
Yeah.

4709
02:47:31,720 --> 02:47:32,840
Now I'm level 16.

4710
02:47:33,440 --> 02:47:34,920
Wow, now I'm level 17.

4711
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:35,860
No, you're not.

4712
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:39,820
I'm level 16 plus infinity.

4713
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:41,280
Oh, yeah?

4714
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:47,060
I'm level 18 and my dad works at Nintendo.

4715
02:47:47,940 --> 02:47:49,000
This is Minecraft.

4716
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:55,380
Who cares if your dad works at Nintendo?

4717
02:47:56,060 --> 02:47:57,100
I care.

4718
02:47:57,640 --> 02:47:59,120
Minecraft is on the Switch.

4719
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:01,880
Your dad doesn't do anything with Minecraft.

4720
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:05,160
Ma'am, this is a Wendy's.

4721
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:05,540
You don't know that.

4722
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:09,360
What if he works in the Minecraft division for this?

4723
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:12,200
You're saying he works in the mines at Nintendo?

4724
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:13,260
Yeah.

4725
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:15,060
It must feel like it.

4726
02:48:20,060 --> 02:48:24,100
We know how JP companies are like.

4727
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:27,500
I think Nintendo is alright though, comparatively speaking.

4728
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:28,260
Yeah.

4729
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:31,080
No, wasn't there...

4730
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:31,960
Wasn't Nintendo...

4731
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:34,240
Wasn't there an article of like one of the...

4732
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:35,420
Wait, we need Lapis, right?

4733
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:37,630
Yeah, and we also need sponsorship, so...

4734
02:48:38,020 --> 02:48:39,160
OK, yeah, you're right.

4735
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:48,940
I love Nintendo.

4736
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:54,100
Let's go, Nintendo.

4737
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:56,240
I have like more than a stack of Lapis.

4738
02:48:56,240 --> 02:48:58,120
Do we need more than one stack of Lapis?

4739
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:00,360
I have almost two stacks.

4740
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,580
OK, I have almost two stacks as well.

4741
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:04,380
Yeah, so I think...

4742
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:06,320
It really depends on our RNG.

4743
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:08,980
I love Nintendo, guys.

4744
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:15,000
Clip it and ship it.

4745
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:22,220
Oh my gosh, I don't wanna do this again.

4746
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:23,520
Doki, we can't die.

4747
02:49:23,700 --> 02:49:24,300
We have to make it.

4748
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:25,740
Why are you saying that to me?

4749
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:27,380
We have to make it.

4750
02:49:27,400 --> 02:49:28,680
Are you trying to imply something?

4751
02:49:29,180 --> 02:49:32,420
We have to make it to the Ender Dragon.

4752
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:34,320
I don't think I can strip mine again.

4753
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:35,720
I can't strip mine again.

4754
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:36,760
I can't do this.

4755
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:38,140
I can't go back to stripping, man.

4756
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:41,640
How did the other streamers that you were inspired by...

4757
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:42,480
How did they do this?

4758
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:43,600
Uh-oh, wait.

4759
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:44,920
It took them...

4760
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:47,420
It took them 20 days, man.

4761
02:49:47,560 --> 02:49:49,240
I don't think that they are the...

4762
02:49:49,240 --> 02:49:52,740
I don't think they are like the goal of like...

4763
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:54,520
Are we doing it right, chat?

4764
02:49:54,580 --> 02:49:55,420
Are we doing this right?

4765
02:49:55,420 --> 02:49:57,340
I don't think we are.

4766
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:59,100
I don't think we're meant to even have diamond.

4767
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:00,220
I think they're like...

4768
02:50:00,220 --> 02:50:00,760
Yes, we are.

4769
02:50:01,400 --> 02:50:02,260
Are we, though?

4770
02:50:02,540 --> 02:50:03,280
Are we?

4771
02:50:03,380 --> 02:50:04,440
We could do this with iron.

4772
02:50:06,500 --> 02:50:08,680
Wait, what if we build snowmen?

4773
02:50:08,820 --> 02:50:09,460
Like, you remember?

4774
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:10,380
Oh, yeah.

4775
02:50:11,500 --> 02:50:14,520
We need to find the ice biome and just farm snow.

4776
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:15,120
Okay.

4777
02:50:15,940 --> 02:50:16,200
Okay.

4778
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:19,540
But that will kill the Enderman, I think.

4779
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:20,780
It won't kill anything else.

4780
02:50:22,660 --> 02:50:24,960
Yeah, no, it would hit the Ender Dragon as well.

4781
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:25,780
Does it?

4782
02:50:27,880 --> 02:50:28,280
Yeah.

4783
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:32,380
Make an army of snowmen?

4784
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:34,160
Yeah, yeah.

4785
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:35,240
I'm pretty sure that works.

4786
02:50:36,160 --> 02:50:37,540
Snowballs don't do damage.

4787
02:50:38,300 --> 02:50:40,740
Wait, what the point was to make snowmen?

4788
02:50:42,480 --> 02:50:43,640
Why did we do that?

4789
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:44,700
Why did we do that?

4790
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:46,240
Yeah, why did we do that?

4791
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,060
Why did we do that, though?

4792
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:49,580
Yeah, why did...

4793
02:50:49,580 --> 02:50:51,480
I think you're the one that suggested it to me.

4794
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:52,380
No, it's not me!

4795
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:53,280
Don't put this on me!

4796
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:54,820
Why did we do that?

4797
02:50:55,720 --> 02:50:57,320
Oh, it was to stagger?

4798
02:50:58,100 --> 02:50:58,740
Stagger what?

4799
02:51:00,040 --> 02:51:02,160
Blazes, but we didn't even do that for the blazes.

4800
02:51:02,320 --> 02:51:04,660
Oh my God, we gotta find the fucking fortress.

4801
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,300
I just remembered.

4802
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:08,080
No, we don't need to...

4803
02:51:08,740 --> 02:51:10,420
We need blaze rods.

4804
02:51:10,680 --> 02:51:12,940
We need blaze rods.

4805
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:16,020
It's fine, we get a fire resistance potions, we'll be fine.

4806
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:17,540
Will we, though?

4807
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:19,020
Probably.

4808
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:20,620
Will we be fine?

4809
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:22,000
Probably.

4810
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:27,520
Where's your name?

4811
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:28,860
I don't even see your name anymore.

4812
02:51:28,900 --> 02:51:29,760
I don't know anymore.

4813
02:51:29,860 --> 02:51:32,340
I've been stripping for...

4814
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:32,960
She's stripping.

4815
02:51:34,040 --> 02:51:37,480
I don't wanna go back to stripping, guys.

4816
02:51:37,620 --> 02:51:39,740
I can't do it again.

4817
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:45,180
I need to turn down the music a little.

4818
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:46,600
I'm going a little crazy.

4819
02:51:47,140 --> 02:51:47,900
What's your music?

4820
02:51:47,900 --> 02:51:54,260
It's just like a free BGM channel called BGM President or some shit.

4821
02:51:54,340 --> 02:51:56,880
Oh, I think I ran into your strip.

4822
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:58,380
Into my...

4823
02:52:06,300 --> 02:52:08,600
It makes the fight easier.

4824
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:10,360
Oh, so we weren't crazy.

4825
02:52:10,860 --> 02:52:12,580
We weren't crazy then.

4826
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:14,100
I was crazy once.

4827
02:52:14,220 --> 02:52:15,280
They locked me in a strip mine.

4828
02:52:15,400 --> 02:52:16,480
A mine full of...

4829
02:52:18,940 --> 02:52:20,580
A mine full of strippers.

4830
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:23,940
I wish.

4831
02:52:25,240 --> 02:52:28,240
Oh my gosh, what if we find the... What's that thing?

4832
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:29,960
That new thing...

4833
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:32,720
The torture room.

4834
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:33,220
The crippling?

4835
02:52:33,460 --> 02:52:34,920
No, I mean that.

4836
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:36,200
The crinkler?

4837
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:40,600
What's that...

4838
02:52:42,340 --> 02:52:43,960
What's that thing that...

4839
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:45,420
The trials!

4840
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:46,500
Yeah, the trials.

4841
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:47,560
The trials?

4842
02:52:47,900 --> 02:52:48,900
The fuck is that?

4843
02:52:49,060 --> 02:52:51,360
How many things did they add since I last played?

4844
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:52,580
It's crazy.

4845
02:52:52,780 --> 02:52:54,080
Minecraft is crazy now.

4846
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:56,560
The scruggly?

4847
02:52:57,400 --> 02:52:58,520
The scruggly?

4848
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:01,020
Oh, I hear a skelly.

4849
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:02,880
Where am I?

4850
02:53:03,500 --> 02:53:04,420
No skelly, please.

4851
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:07,500
What if I like...

4852
02:53:08,900 --> 02:53:10,660
What if like...

4853
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:13,640
I grab that moment again and then re-dub it to like...

4854
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:15,020
Change...

4855
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:16,320
What?

4856
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,620
You know the first moment?

4857
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:21,780
Oh, yeah.

4858
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:25,220
I re-dub the name so the moment can live on.

4859
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,520
What if we... Okay, hold on.

4860
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:32,340
We dub over the names and then we also re-film it because...

4861
02:53:33,740 --> 02:53:36,360
Because our skins would be different.

4862
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:36,940
Or mine.

4863
02:53:37,140 --> 02:53:38,740
No, we re-animate it.

4864
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:45,400
No, we can just do it in... We can make the whole environment look the exact same.

4865
02:53:45,620 --> 02:53:46,620
Oh my god, you're right.

4866
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:47,040
We can.

4867
02:53:47,100 --> 02:53:48,580
We can just do it in creative mode.

4868
02:53:49,060 --> 02:53:51,360
Yeah, just react and...

4869
02:53:59,240 --> 02:54:00,480
We can do it.

4870
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,760
It's... What is it called?

4871
02:54:03,940 --> 02:54:04,480
Like when...

4872
02:54:05,380 --> 02:54:07,420
The react videos when they...

4873
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:08,980
It's fair use, guys.

4874
02:54:08,980 --> 02:54:09,500
Fair use?

4875
02:54:10,820 --> 02:54:13,120
We could just... We're just like...

4876
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:16,240
It's like a very famous moment that happened in Minecraft.

4877
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:18,280
Yeah, it's like a parody.

4878
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:19,620
Yeah, a parody.

4879
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:20,440
A parody.

4880
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:29,660
We're not claiming we own it.

4881
02:54:29,660 --> 02:54:31,120
We're just trying to parody it.

4882
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:34,020
It's such a famous moment.

4883
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:36,600
Famous moment in Minecraft that happened.

4884
02:54:36,840 --> 02:54:37,720
Everybody knows about that moment.

4885
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:39,520
It's transformative, exactly.

4886
02:54:40,220 --> 02:54:41,360
Like even...

4887
02:54:42,120 --> 02:54:42,820
What's it?

4888
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:44,360
Squackity knows about that moment.

4889
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:45,640
Yeah, yeah.

4890
02:54:45,660 --> 02:54:47,920
Everyone who plays Minecraft knows that moment.

4891
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:49,720
What was it called?

4892
02:54:50,980 --> 02:54:52,840
Even ThomasInnit knows about it.

4893
02:54:53,380 --> 02:54:54,720
ThomasInnit knows that moment.

4894
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:56,060
Yeah, it was TommyInnit.

4895
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:56,640
Oh.

4896
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:00,440
TommyInnit.

4897
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:02,860
It's YouTube history.

4898
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:05,300
It's a tribute we'd be making.

4899
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:05,720
A tribute.

4900
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:08,020
Yeah, we're making a tribute.

4901
02:55:08,680 --> 02:55:09,000
Yeah.

4902
02:55:09,480 --> 02:55:10,000
Exactly.

4903
02:55:11,580 --> 02:55:13,420
Oh my god, I'm going crazy.

4904
02:55:13,480 --> 02:55:13,920
I have 23.

4905
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:14,920
I'm almost there.

4906
02:55:15,400 --> 02:55:15,940
Wait, seriously?

4907
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:16,660
I have it.

4908
02:55:16,920 --> 02:55:18,720
I should be able to make a full army.

4909
02:55:18,820 --> 02:55:19,620
Wait, how many do you have?

4910
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:20,600
I only have 15.

4911
02:55:21,200 --> 02:55:22,640
You only have...

4912
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:24,900
What the hell is this?

4913
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:28,120
Nothing's changed.

4914
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:32,600
Clearly nothing has changed.

4915
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:35,140
At least finding more iron.

4916
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:41,220
I didn't even acknowledge it because I was like, surely she's finding stuff, right?

4917
02:55:41,500 --> 02:55:43,440
I'm not finding anything.

4918
02:55:45,940 --> 02:55:47,640
That's unfortunate for you.

4919
02:55:47,660 --> 02:55:50,360
I was finding it at first this whole time.

4920
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:53,320
Okay, to be fair, you mine faster because you have a diamond pickaxe.

4921
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:56,000
Oh yeah, are you trying to say that was a good investment?

4922
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:58,180
I'm just saying it was.

4923
02:55:58,300 --> 02:55:58,660
Is that what you're trying to say?

4924
02:55:58,660 --> 02:55:59,840
I'm saying you invested.

4925
02:55:59,920 --> 02:56:06,460
Are you trying to say what I did there where I got a diamond pickaxe and you're like, no, don't do it.

4926
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:08,560
Good is subjective, okay?

4927
02:56:08,980 --> 02:56:10,140
Good is subjective.

4928
02:56:11,080 --> 02:56:13,840
I'm just slow because I have just only iron.

4929
02:56:14,020 --> 02:56:14,620
Are you calling me?

4930
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:16,820
You're saying, okay, now you're making fun of me for being poor?

4931
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:18,120
That's so messed up.

4932
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:22,380
That's so messed up.

4933
02:56:23,460 --> 02:56:26,020
I'm trying to make my way through this world.

4934
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:29,900
I'm just trying to make my way through this damn cruel world.

4935
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:31,480
The rich gets richer!

4936
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:35,980
That's why you gotta learn now.

4937
02:56:43,320 --> 02:56:47,580
I can't believe you still don't have... I can't believe you have 15.

4938
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:48,640
Okay, well, you know what?

4939
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:51,600
Doki, you're just gonna have to keep digging because you're gonna wait for me.

4940
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:53,900
And I'm gonna keep strip mining for you.

4941
02:56:55,320 --> 02:56:58,100
I'll just keep going forever and ever and then I'll die.

4942
02:56:58,460 --> 02:57:02,020
And then you won't... Oh my god, it died.

4943
02:57:02,860 --> 02:57:03,360
Oh, shoot.

4944
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:09,040
I swear to god, if you die after everything, I'm mine all the way till...

4945
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:10,360
I will.

4946
02:57:10,780 --> 02:57:11,500
I'll die.

4947
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:12,300
I'll die.

4948
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:14,600
Because you spite me and I will die.

4949
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:15,040
Do it!

4950
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:15,440
Do it!

4951
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:16,020
No, do it.

4952
02:57:16,100 --> 02:57:16,340
Do it.

4953
02:57:16,400 --> 02:57:17,080
We'll do this at the end.

4954
02:57:17,220 --> 02:57:17,760
No, I'm fine.

4955
02:57:17,900 --> 02:57:18,180
I'm working.

4956
02:57:18,220 --> 02:57:19,240
I doubt that.

4957
02:57:19,360 --> 02:57:19,640
I doubt that.

4958
02:57:19,640 --> 02:57:20,900
I really doubt that.

4959
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:21,780
I really doubt that.

4960
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:24,260
Alright, go kill yourself right now in Minecraft.

4961
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:24,880
I'm gonna use the bathtub.

4962
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:29,040
Oh, you really had to add that in Minecraft in there real fast, huh, girl?

4963
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:34,200
Yeah, you had to add that.

4964
02:57:34,260 --> 02:57:36,080
You had to add that real fast in there.

4965
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:39,640
I'm gonna use the bathtub.

4966
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:40,200
Okay.

4967
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:41,940
And I'll come back and you're still alive.

4968
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:43,000
I don't know.

4969
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:43,980
Okay.

4970
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:46,800
Is she gone?

4971
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:49,400
Is she gone?

4972
02:57:52,260 --> 02:57:53,080
What was that?

4973
02:57:56,820 --> 02:57:58,180
Guys, did you hear that running?

4974
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:02,460
Guys, did you hear that running?

4975
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,020
What was that?

4976
02:58:07,620 --> 02:58:08,760
It was like a...

4977
02:58:08,760 --> 02:58:10,100
Wait, what was that?

4978
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:10,680
Doki?

4979
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:11,760
Doki?

4980
02:58:17,510 --> 02:58:19,350
It wasn't me mining the lapis.

4981
02:58:23,310 --> 02:58:24,690
Was it me mining the lapis?

4982
02:58:24,890 --> 02:58:25,650
Actually, I don't know.

4983
02:58:25,970 --> 02:58:27,010
Guys, I almost have enough.

4984
02:58:28,510 --> 02:58:29,550
I almost have enough diamond.

4985
02:58:31,730 --> 02:58:32,530
The crinkler.

4986
02:58:34,970 --> 02:58:35,770
That wasn't...

4987
02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:36,590
That sounded different.

4988
02:58:36,670 --> 02:58:37,810
No, there's a skeleton right there.

4989
02:58:37,870 --> 02:58:39,070
I think he's on the other side.

4990
02:58:40,750 --> 02:58:41,890
Are you actually gonna die?

4991
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:43,650
I heard running.

4992
02:58:44,950 --> 02:58:45,350
Running?

4993
02:58:47,330 --> 02:58:48,910
Wait, that's not in the game.

4994
02:58:48,910 --> 02:58:49,610
I don't know.

4995
02:58:49,730 --> 02:58:51,770
I think Karol Bryant is coming for me.

4996
02:58:52,310 --> 02:58:53,010
Oh, thank God.

4997
02:58:57,150 --> 02:58:59,390
I think Karol Bryant is here for me.

4998
02:58:59,650 --> 02:59:01,190
It's all... It's so over.

4999
02:59:01,330 --> 02:59:01,590
It's so over for me.

5000
02:59:01,610 --> 02:59:04,990
You just had like a Halloween mod on the entire time.

5001
02:59:07,110 --> 02:59:07,410
Yeah.

5002
02:59:10,490 --> 02:59:11,370
Oh, skellies?

5003
02:59:11,530 --> 02:59:14,050
Okay, I think I'm about to hit a...

5004
02:59:14,050 --> 02:59:16,910
Are you got any new diamonds since... Since then?

5005
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:18,290
Since 15?

5006
02:59:18,390 --> 02:59:19,270
Are you still at 15?

5007
02:59:20,310 --> 02:59:21,330
I'm... Yes.

5008
02:59:21,430 --> 02:59:22,350
You're still at 15?

5009
02:59:22,630 --> 02:59:23,270
What happened?

5010
02:59:23,810 --> 02:59:27,570
I've been... I'm strapping and also there's someone running after me.

5011
02:59:29,330 --> 02:59:30,970
Oh my God, what's that sound?

5012
02:59:32,090 --> 02:59:32,770
Eerie cave.

5013
02:59:37,230 --> 02:59:39,170
Eerie cave, eerie cave.

5014
02:59:39,170 --> 02:59:40,410
Scary, spooky cave.

5015
02:59:40,470 --> 02:59:42,490
Where the fuck did I put my crafting table?

5016
02:59:42,530 --> 02:59:43,030
Oh, right here.

5017
02:59:43,110 --> 02:59:43,950
I didn't pick it up.

5018
02:59:46,650 --> 02:59:46,970
Scary!

5019
02:59:47,890 --> 02:59:48,530
Scary cave.

5020
02:59:48,750 --> 02:59:49,630
Spooky, scary.

5021
02:59:50,330 --> 02:59:52,550
Wait, I wanna make... Wait, I wanna make an iron pickaxe.

5022
02:59:52,770 --> 02:59:53,550
My other pickaxe is almost dead.

5023
02:59:53,550 --> 02:59:54,730
How do we get to the crinkler?

5024
02:59:54,830 --> 02:59:55,870
What biome is he in?

5025
02:59:56,130 --> 02:59:58,290
Yeah, what is the... What is the crinkler?

5026
03:00:00,450 --> 03:00:01,290
I don't even know.

5027
03:00:02,030 --> 03:00:02,530
Yeah, I don't know.

5028
03:00:02,830 --> 03:00:05,110
The only thing I know about the crinkler is what you just told me.

5029
03:00:05,450 --> 03:00:06,090
He crinkles.

5030
03:00:06,490 --> 03:00:07,070
He crinkles.

5031
03:00:07,900 --> 03:00:09,510
He just crinkles.

5032
03:00:11,970 --> 03:00:13,410
He's behind you, don't say that.

5033
03:00:13,410 --> 03:00:14,470
Wait, do I have one rail?

5034
03:00:14,610 --> 03:00:15,170
Oh, I do.

5035
03:00:15,350 --> 03:00:18,250
I have one singular rail track.

5036
03:00:24,910 --> 03:00:26,150
I'm gonna go crazy.

5037
03:00:26,270 --> 03:00:28,810
I'm so mining because somebody still doesn't have 24.

5038
03:00:29,190 --> 03:00:30,010
I'm trying!

5039
03:00:31,470 --> 03:00:32,670
Are you though?

5040
03:00:32,830 --> 03:00:34,190
Are you really trying?

5041
03:00:34,250 --> 03:00:35,290
I'm mining!

5042
03:00:36,270 --> 03:00:39,710
Oh, I'm gonna find your... Okay, I'm gonna find where your hole is.

5043
03:00:39,750 --> 03:00:39,930
What?

5044
03:00:40,010 --> 03:00:40,470
Then you what?

5045
03:00:40,510 --> 03:00:42,230
You're gonna steal my diamonds from me?

5046
03:00:42,230 --> 03:00:43,850
No, I'm gonna help you!

5047
03:00:43,970 --> 03:00:46,470
You'll steal my diamonds from me and then you'll be like...

5048
03:00:47,590 --> 03:00:49,250
I have all the diamonds.

5049
03:00:49,530 --> 03:00:50,750
Beg me for more.

5050
03:00:52,230 --> 03:00:53,670
That's what you'll say.

5051
03:00:56,130 --> 03:00:58,250
I don't wanna be stuck in these mines anymore.

5052
03:00:58,250 --> 03:00:59,670
You're not welcome into my hole.

5053
03:00:59,850 --> 03:01:01,070
You're not welcome into my hole.

5054
03:01:01,470 --> 03:01:03,030
You're not consenting?

5055
03:01:05,290 --> 03:01:06,150
Stay out!

5056
03:01:06,330 --> 03:01:06,950
Stay out!

5057
03:01:07,630 --> 03:01:09,110
I better not see you.

5058
03:01:09,390 --> 03:01:10,410
I better not see your name.

5059
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:11,850
I don't know where you are actually.

5060
03:01:12,030 --> 03:01:12,870
I don't know either.

5061
03:01:12,970 --> 03:01:13,870
I don't know...

5062
03:01:13,870 --> 03:01:16,290
I've been in this one area.

5063
03:01:16,850 --> 03:01:18,970
I've been in this one area.

5064
03:01:18,970 --> 03:01:21,790
If you just keep going forever you'll eventually get good.

5065
03:01:22,310 --> 03:01:27,110
My great-great grandchildren are gonna be in this one mine.

5066
03:01:28,150 --> 03:01:30,090
Okay, but we gotta get more levels too.

5067
03:01:31,330 --> 03:01:32,450
I'm at level 18.

5068
03:01:32,550 --> 03:01:33,810
How many more levels do we need?

5069
03:01:33,810 --> 03:01:36,590
Do you know how much it costs to level up stuff?

5070
03:01:36,870 --> 03:01:38,970
I don't remember how much.

5071
03:01:39,350 --> 03:01:40,790
No, I don't.

5072
03:01:41,130 --> 03:01:41,910
Do you remember?

5073
03:01:42,430 --> 03:01:43,810
It costs a lot.

5074
03:01:44,570 --> 03:01:45,790
How much is a lot?

5075
03:01:45,890 --> 03:01:46,570
How much is a lot?

5076
03:01:46,670 --> 03:01:47,230
Like 50.

5077
03:01:49,090 --> 03:01:50,950
There's no way it's 50.

5078
03:01:51,290 --> 03:01:52,390
It's a lot, I promise.

5079
03:01:52,850 --> 03:01:53,610
There's no way.

5080
03:01:53,710 --> 03:01:54,610
It's not 50.

5081
03:01:58,790 --> 03:02:02,030
I'm having backseaters in my chat telling me how to dig.

5082
03:02:02,030 --> 03:02:03,870
Oh my god, good.

5083
03:02:06,850 --> 03:02:09,150
I don't know, mid, you're at 15.

5084
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:12,030
I don't have these backseaters, that's all I'm saying.

5085
03:02:12,510 --> 03:02:18,050
I got to 24 and I don't have these backseaters right now.

5086
03:02:18,050 --> 03:02:20,570
We need more than 24, Doki!

5087
03:02:21,690 --> 03:02:23,610
Oh my god, I want it.

5088
03:02:24,010 --> 03:02:31,810
I have three extra.

5089
03:02:32,190 --> 03:02:33,730
What more do we need?

5090
03:02:34,970 --> 03:02:36,490
Wait, what do you mean you have three extra?

5091
03:02:36,910 --> 03:02:37,810
I have three more.

5092
03:02:37,930 --> 03:02:38,470
I have three.

5093
03:02:39,550 --> 03:02:41,870
I made all my... I have more than 24.

5094
03:02:42,250 --> 03:02:43,610
Oh, wait, how much is a sword then?

5095
03:02:44,630 --> 03:02:46,230
Wait, I can make a sword right now.

5096
03:02:46,410 --> 03:02:47,630
I can literally make a sword right now.

5097
03:02:47,630 --> 03:02:49,290
You didn't say that!

5098
03:02:52,990 --> 03:02:53,690
I'm digging.

5099
03:02:55,050 --> 03:02:56,130
I'm digging too.

5100
03:02:56,330 --> 03:02:58,270
I might as well make another diamond pickaxe.

5101
03:02:58,830 --> 03:02:59,970
Oh, can I have it?

5102
03:03:01,470 --> 03:03:05,430
Might as well use the last three to make a diamond pickaxe.

5103
03:03:05,710 --> 03:03:07,050
Oh, fuck it, I'm going to do it.

5104
03:03:07,590 --> 03:03:10,150
I don't know how long I'm going to be trapped in this mine.

5105
03:03:10,350 --> 03:03:11,470
I like my boots.

5106
03:03:12,130 --> 03:03:13,790
I don't know how long I'm going to be trapped in here.

5107
03:03:13,850 --> 03:03:16,650
I might as well make another diamond pickaxe.

5108
03:03:16,650 --> 03:03:17,570
I'm going to go mad.

5109
03:03:17,650 --> 03:03:20,070
I'm going to get mad trip disease.

5110
03:03:21,310 --> 03:03:22,170
Are you done?

5111
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:24,130
Yeah.

5112
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:29,640
Yeah.

5113
03:03:31,020 --> 03:03:31,840
I'm done.

5114
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:38,420
Guys, I know it's been like three hours, but Hope Mint was not too quiet.

5115
03:03:39,240 --> 03:03:42,880
Sometimes she hits the green instead of the yellow, so I got a little worried.

5116
03:03:43,560 --> 03:03:44,040
What do you mean?

5117
03:03:48,140 --> 03:03:48,800
Now what?

5118
03:03:49,960 --> 03:03:51,780
Now you finally made armor?

5119
03:03:52,600 --> 03:03:53,000
Yeah.

5120
03:03:56,320 --> 03:03:58,080
I like my boots and stuff though.

5121
03:03:58,420 --> 03:03:59,060
I'm going to miss them.

5122
03:03:59,180 --> 03:04:00,700
Oh my gosh, I keep clicking the wrong thing.

5123
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:03,320
Like auto...

5124
03:04:04,040 --> 03:04:05,160
Thank god I didn't know.

5125
03:04:05,300 --> 03:04:06,040
Don't die!

5126
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:07,060
That was lava.

5127
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:08,600
Don't die!

5128
03:04:09,340 --> 03:04:09,980
Wait, how many shots?

5129
03:04:13,300 --> 03:04:13,700
Okay.

5130
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:16,480
I'm just going to leave it here.

5131
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:17,580
It could be a little louder.

5132
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:20,860
It's been three hours.

5133
03:04:23,060 --> 03:04:25,940
She could have been a little louder three hours ago.

5134
03:04:28,020 --> 03:04:29,900
I don't know what's wrong with my Discord.

5135
03:04:30,120 --> 03:04:30,940
I really don't.

5136
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:33,480
Yeah, like I have you like...

5137
03:04:37,960 --> 03:04:40,060
You apparently could have been a little louder.

5138
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:43,220
That's not my fault.

5139
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:44,100
Oh no!

5140
03:04:44,100 --> 03:04:46,060
There's something wrong with your Discord.

5141
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:47,140
You changed the setting.

5142
03:04:47,300 --> 03:04:49,080
I didn't change anything though.

5143
03:04:49,180 --> 03:04:51,440
Oh no, I have to buy... I have to get the diamond pickaxe.

5144
03:04:58,100 --> 03:04:59,520
I'm going fast now.

5145
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:03,780
Okay, I upped her a bit more guys.

5146
03:05:06,660 --> 03:05:08,540
So I hope it's a lot better now.

5147
03:05:12,090 --> 03:05:13,230
Am I loud?

5148
03:05:14,730 --> 03:05:15,970
No, you're like barely loud.

5149
03:05:15,970 --> 03:05:17,390
Am I like quiet on my stream?

5150
03:05:17,470 --> 03:05:18,410
Yeah, because on my stream...

5151
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:18,690
No, you're not.

5152
03:05:18,750 --> 03:05:20,450
You're not quiet on your stream.

5153
03:05:20,530 --> 03:05:21,150
It's just...

5154
03:05:21,150 --> 03:05:26,510
You did something to your Discord that like made it so that it's...

5155
03:05:26,510 --> 03:05:28,890
Like I don't know what you're... Something with your setup.

5156
03:05:29,030 --> 03:05:31,290
But all my settings are... I've sent you my settings.

5157
03:05:31,490 --> 03:05:32,390
They're all normal.

5158
03:05:32,910 --> 03:05:34,290
Yeah, but like...

5159
03:05:34,290 --> 03:05:38,410
Because like there was a time where like suddenly it was just different.

5160
03:05:38,670 --> 03:05:41,430
Where like you're like super quiet for everybody on Discord.

5161
03:05:41,710 --> 03:05:42,270
And I don't know what you did.

5162
03:05:42,270 --> 03:05:44,090
I don't know what... I didn't do anything!

5163
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:46,930
Discord's trying to sabotage me!

5164
03:05:48,410 --> 03:05:49,470
I don't know what you did.

5165
03:05:49,570 --> 03:05:50,550
I didn't do anything.

5166
03:05:50,890 --> 03:05:52,230
I don't know what you did.

5167
03:05:52,370 --> 03:05:53,350
That's what they all say.

5168
03:05:53,470 --> 03:05:54,930
That's what they all say.

5169
03:05:55,210 --> 03:05:56,490
That's what they all say.

5170
03:05:57,370 --> 03:05:58,770
Okay, I'm gonna go this way now.

5171
03:05:59,610 --> 03:06:00,650
I'm changing directions.

5172
03:06:02,550 --> 03:06:04,930
My diamond pickaxe is about to break.

5173
03:06:05,030 --> 03:06:07,170
This is how long we've been trip mining for.

5174
03:06:08,030 --> 03:06:08,790
Wow, finally?

5175
03:06:08,790 --> 03:06:10,350
My diamond pick... yeah.

5176
03:06:10,730 --> 03:06:11,570
Yes, finally.

5177
03:06:11,750 --> 03:06:14,150
We've been mining for like an hour plus, I'm pretty sure.

5178
03:06:14,490 --> 03:06:19,130
I'm pretty sure I've been stuck in the... I haven't seen daylight in like 20 years, man.

5179
03:06:19,690 --> 03:06:21,710
Wait, how do we get out of this?

5180
03:06:21,990 --> 03:06:25,510
We just make a fucking ladder staircase.

5181
03:06:27,390 --> 03:06:28,650
Remember how to take up?

5182
03:06:28,690 --> 03:06:30,170
We've always done that before.

5183
03:06:30,570 --> 03:06:30,890
Okay.

5184
03:06:33,990 --> 03:06:35,130
I wish we had fortune.

5185
03:06:36,190 --> 03:06:37,010
Me too.

5186
03:06:37,870 --> 03:06:39,750
I wish a lot of things, man.

5187
03:06:39,870 --> 03:06:44,590
I wish... I wish you'd get more diamonds.

5188
03:06:45,010 --> 03:06:46,990
Like at this point, now it's just sad.

5189
03:06:54,030 --> 03:06:55,790
This is just sad now.

5190
03:06:56,770 --> 03:06:58,130
Hey, I'm doing my best, okay?

5191
03:06:58,370 --> 03:06:59,150
I'm doing my best.

5192
03:06:59,150 --> 03:06:59,390
Are you?

5193
03:06:59,670 --> 03:07:00,490
Are you?

5194
03:07:01,150 --> 03:07:01,950
I'm digging!

5195
03:07:02,830 --> 03:07:05,370
If you were doing your best, you could've made a diamond pickaxe.

5196
03:07:06,250 --> 03:07:07,410
I made one!

5197
03:07:08,390 --> 03:07:12,010
Now, after an hour and a half!

5198
03:07:14,150 --> 03:07:16,190
It doesn't matter how long it took me.

5199
03:07:16,510 --> 03:07:17,170
Yes it does!

5200
03:07:17,470 --> 03:07:18,190
Yes it does!

5201
03:07:23,050 --> 03:07:24,870
This could've been over!

5202
03:07:29,170 --> 03:07:31,870
We would've been out of the mining stages!

5203
03:07:33,830 --> 03:07:35,270
Don't you want this to go?

5204
03:07:35,450 --> 03:07:37,210
How long do you want this stream to last?

5205
03:07:40,450 --> 03:07:43,350
I will cancel my other streams if you're gonna do this.

5206
03:07:49,450 --> 03:07:50,930
That pickaxe is about to die?

5207
03:07:51,230 --> 03:07:54,250
Well, good thing I have enough for another pickaxe!

5208
03:07:54,350 --> 03:07:55,450
Lucky you!

5209
03:07:55,910 --> 03:07:57,090
Oh my god, that was lava.

5210
03:08:00,910 --> 03:08:01,450
Okay...

5211
03:08:04,410 --> 03:08:06,910
YouTube streams can only go up to 12 hours.

5212
03:08:07,230 --> 03:08:09,030
That's why we'll make a part 2!

5213
03:08:16,010 --> 03:08:17,910
Do you have a lot of iron?

5214
03:08:19,270 --> 03:08:21,370
I have... 20.

5215
03:08:21,910 --> 03:08:24,090
Okay, we might need more for shields.

5216
03:08:25,850 --> 03:08:26,450
Shields.

5217
03:08:26,450 --> 03:08:29,130
Okay, that's 5.

5218
03:08:32,210 --> 03:08:35,010
Part 2 is still in the mine!

5219
03:08:35,950 --> 03:08:38,170
At one point, it doesn't turn into a joke.

5220
03:08:38,310 --> 03:08:42,090
It's not my fault that my luck is very bad!

5221
03:08:43,270 --> 03:08:46,270
If not luck, you could've made a diamond!

5222
03:08:49,420 --> 03:08:51,880
At that point, it's not luck, it's a skill issue.

5223
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:02,180
Oh my god...

5224
03:09:02,180 --> 03:09:02,860
Oh my god...

5225
03:09:02,860 --> 03:09:05,200
Okay, time to make my fucking...

5226
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:06,980
Another diamond pickaxe!

5227
03:09:07,100 --> 03:09:07,920
Let's fucking go!

5228
03:09:11,820 --> 03:09:14,740
I don't even have fucking...

5229
03:09:14,740 --> 03:09:16,280
I need to make another stick.

5230
03:09:21,590 --> 03:09:23,270
Alright, here we go.

5231
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:25,270
I'm going down a different direction now.

5232
03:09:25,910 --> 03:09:27,530
I feel promised in this way.

5233
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:28,650
Good for you.

5234
03:09:28,690 --> 03:09:30,430
We don't need redstones, right?

5235
03:09:30,890 --> 03:09:32,690
No, we don't need a redstone.

5236
03:09:32,970 --> 03:09:37,530
Okay, I've been in the mines for so long, I keep forgetting what we need and what we don't need now.

5237
03:09:37,730 --> 03:09:39,470
All I see is just cobblestone.

5238
03:09:39,650 --> 03:09:41,190
What if this was beating Minecraft?

5239
03:09:41,630 --> 03:09:45,370
Like, what if the mine... It's Minecraft, technically we're beating it.

5240
03:09:46,290 --> 03:09:48,110
Do you know the worst part, Mint?

5241
03:09:49,090 --> 03:09:49,530
Yeah?

5242
03:09:49,730 --> 03:09:53,110
The nether is supposed to be the hardest part out of this.

5243
03:09:53,570 --> 03:09:55,710
The nether is supposed to be the hardest part.

5244
03:09:55,710 --> 03:09:56,910
It's supposed to be.

5245
03:09:57,450 --> 03:10:01,950
All we need are... We need some green mushrooms to get rid of the hogs.

5246
03:10:02,090 --> 03:10:03,990
We need some...

5247
03:10:03,990 --> 03:10:06,730
We need some lava to kill hogs.

5248
03:10:06,750 --> 03:10:07,310
Oh, we're good.

5249
03:10:07,370 --> 03:10:08,570
We need some potions.

5250
03:10:08,790 --> 03:10:11,570
We just gotta go find a village with a potion plate thing.

5251
03:10:11,690 --> 03:10:12,330
And we're good.

5252
03:10:15,310 --> 03:10:20,890
Yeah, and what if a ghastly comes up to us while we're crossing the...

5253
03:10:20,890 --> 03:10:21,190
A ghastly?

5254
03:10:21,410 --> 03:10:22,410
What game are we...

5255
03:10:23,150 --> 03:10:24,870
What game are we playing now?

5256
03:10:24,870 --> 03:10:27,570
Oh, sorry, I have a Cobblemon mod on.

5257
03:10:29,290 --> 03:10:33,550
What if, you know, the ghast comes in and goes...

5258
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:35,810
And then, like, we fall into the lava.

5259
03:10:36,690 --> 03:10:37,870
That's what shields are for.

5260
03:10:38,650 --> 03:10:40,350
What if we don't do the shields in time?

5261
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:42,890
You run around with your shield.

5262
03:10:42,970 --> 03:10:43,690
What are you talking about?

5263
03:10:44,110 --> 03:10:45,330
What if I don't do it in time?

5264
03:10:45,450 --> 03:10:47,350
What if I don't do this in time?

5265
03:10:48,170 --> 03:10:50,890
I mean, I can't... I don't know what's gonna happen if we die on this run.

5266
03:10:50,990 --> 03:10:52,450
I don't know what's gonna become of me.

5267
03:10:53,470 --> 03:10:57,650
It's only, like, the first run that we've gotten this far, but...

5268
03:10:58,250 --> 03:11:01,870
I don't know what's gonna happen to me because then we have to do this all over again.

5269
03:11:01,990 --> 03:11:03,790
This specific part of the run.

5270
03:11:04,730 --> 03:11:07,690
At that point, I'm not even gonna... I don't even wanna...

5271
03:11:07,690 --> 03:11:09,430
At a point, we might as well just do it with Iron.

5272
03:11:09,530 --> 03:11:10,510
I don't care anymore.

5273
03:11:11,590 --> 03:11:13,030
She's really losing it, you guys.

5274
03:11:13,410 --> 03:11:14,310
She's so weak.

5275
03:11:14,550 --> 03:11:16,350
It's only been hour three.

5276
03:11:16,490 --> 03:11:17,510
You're literally a ghost.

5277
03:11:17,630 --> 03:11:18,450
You're dead already.

5278
03:11:18,590 --> 03:11:19,610
Like, you don't know...

5279
03:11:20,430 --> 03:11:21,470
You're weak.

5280
03:11:21,990 --> 03:11:23,670
You're... You're dead.

5281
03:11:24,170 --> 03:11:25,610
You're literally a ghost.

5282
03:11:25,830 --> 03:11:27,070
So what does that have to do with it?

5283
03:11:27,750 --> 03:11:30,810
You don't care about dying because you're already dead.

5284
03:11:32,670 --> 03:11:33,670
Join me.

5285
03:11:33,810 --> 03:11:34,230
I don't know.

5286
03:11:34,330 --> 03:11:35,590
What do you want me to say?

5287
03:11:36,090 --> 03:11:38,610
The strip madness is getting to me.

5288
03:11:39,630 --> 03:11:40,990
The strip madness madness.

5289
03:11:45,050 --> 03:11:47,090
How much more can you take?

5290
03:11:47,290 --> 03:11:48,530
Like, how much more can I...

5291
03:11:48,530 --> 03:11:49,450
Are you still at 15?

5292
03:11:49,530 --> 03:11:50,230
Are you still at 15?

5293
03:11:52,470 --> 03:11:54,030
You're still at 15, aren't you?

5294
03:11:54,330 --> 03:11:56,330
You're still at 15, aren't you?

5295
03:11:56,530 --> 03:12:00,930
I just found three more diamonds and you're still...

5296
03:12:01,690 --> 03:12:04,070
I'm doing my best!

5297
03:12:05,550 --> 03:12:06,970
I'm gonna find your hole.

5298
03:12:07,210 --> 03:12:09,230
I'm gonna find your hole and dig that hole.

5299
03:12:09,950 --> 03:12:11,550
I'm freaking coming back.

5300
03:12:13,210 --> 03:12:14,570
Let me dig this.

5301
03:12:14,730 --> 03:12:14,890
Alright.

5302
03:12:16,150 --> 03:12:17,710
Okay, give me your coordinates.

5303
03:12:18,190 --> 03:12:19,750
No, find my hole!

5304
03:12:20,190 --> 03:12:21,310
Give me your coordinates!

5305
03:12:23,730 --> 03:12:24,990
I'm coming over.

5306
03:12:25,090 --> 03:12:25,550
I'm coming over.

5307
03:12:25,690 --> 03:12:26,910
I'm running over.

5308
03:12:27,010 --> 03:12:27,950
You don't even know where I am.

5309
03:12:28,690 --> 03:12:30,370
I've been digging so many holes.

5310
03:12:30,770 --> 03:12:33,230
There's so many holes.

5311
03:12:33,610 --> 03:12:36,870
I'm surprised no monsters spawn into any of these holes that we've created.

5312
03:12:36,870 --> 03:12:38,230
Honestly, I'm surprised too.

5313
03:12:40,550 --> 03:12:42,830
Wait, but seriously, how much more can you take?

5314
03:12:44,010 --> 03:12:45,650
I think this is your hole.

5315
03:12:45,850 --> 03:12:47,270
I didn't dig... No, this is my hole?

5316
03:12:47,370 --> 03:12:48,790
Oh wait, this is the hole I dug with lava.

5317
03:12:49,950 --> 03:12:50,350
Okay.

5318
03:12:50,890 --> 03:12:52,250
Unless that's my hole with lava.

5319
03:12:53,610 --> 03:12:56,230
How many holes with lava did you find?

5320
03:12:56,450 --> 03:12:58,150
Wait, did you leave a... I just need to know.

5321
03:12:58,230 --> 03:13:02,350
Did you leave a hole unattended with like lava?

5322
03:13:03,070 --> 03:13:03,510
Yeah.

5323
03:13:03,830 --> 03:13:04,930
Wait, what do you mean by that?

5324
03:13:05,730 --> 03:13:08,470
Like, did you leave a hole where like...

5325
03:13:08,470 --> 03:13:11,930
I could accidentally walk into where there's... where it's a pit?

5326
03:13:13,270 --> 03:13:14,970
Uh... I don't think so.

5327
03:13:15,630 --> 03:13:16,350
Okay, alright.

5328
03:13:17,050 --> 03:13:18,310
Alright, that's good to know.

5329
03:13:20,690 --> 03:13:22,830
I think I wanna just find one more.

5330
03:13:24,910 --> 03:13:27,990
Okay, I'm gonna try and find you right now.

5331
03:13:28,110 --> 03:13:30,230
Oh my god, how long have I been digging?

5332
03:13:30,770 --> 03:13:32,430
This does not stop.

5333
03:13:32,630 --> 03:13:32,910
What?

5334
03:13:33,430 --> 03:13:36,090
This... This doesn't stop.

5335
03:13:37,030 --> 03:13:38,110
Holy shit.

5336
03:13:39,790 --> 03:13:40,830
I dug a lot.

5337
03:13:40,830 --> 03:13:43,450
I'm still... No, I'm still at my hole.

5338
03:13:44,650 --> 03:13:46,190
Damn, Doki, okay.

5339
03:13:47,370 --> 03:13:48,850
Okay, they found your hole.

5340
03:13:49,430 --> 03:13:49,910
Did you?

5341
03:13:50,090 --> 03:13:51,450
You have torches, okay.

5342
03:13:52,290 --> 03:13:53,150
Oh, you left this.

5343
03:13:53,390 --> 03:13:53,970
What did I leave?

5344
03:13:54,410 --> 03:13:55,530
You left the redstone.

5345
03:13:56,010 --> 03:13:56,850
You don't need the redstone.

5346
03:13:56,850 --> 03:13:57,690
Precious experience.

5347
03:13:58,150 --> 03:13:59,110
You need the experience.

5348
03:13:59,110 --> 03:14:00,530
Oh, the experience, yeah.

5349
03:14:00,950 --> 03:14:02,970
Okay, you put torches in your hole, right?

5350
03:14:03,350 --> 03:14:04,250
Not all of them.

5351
03:14:05,470 --> 03:14:07,570
Alright, this has to be your hole.

5352
03:14:08,010 --> 03:14:09,390
I didn't put any torches in mine.

5353
03:14:11,770 --> 03:14:12,210
Okay.

5354
03:14:12,490 --> 03:14:12,930
Okay.

5355
03:14:13,750 --> 03:14:15,790
Oh my god, this is a long asshole.

5356
03:14:17,410 --> 03:14:18,750
Okay, you must have...

5357
03:14:18,750 --> 03:14:19,830
Go into the right one.

5358
03:14:19,930 --> 03:14:21,250
I've changed a couple of times.

5359
03:14:29,350 --> 03:14:30,870
Okay, which one?

5360
03:14:31,010 --> 03:14:32,350
This is the one with lava.

5361
03:14:33,470 --> 03:14:35,630
What the fuck is this?

5362
03:14:35,830 --> 03:14:36,410
It's what?

5363
03:14:36,410 --> 03:14:37,170
What?

5364
03:14:40,070 --> 03:14:42,410
Mine is so much more straightforward.

5365
03:14:43,310 --> 03:14:44,870
Like, what are these?

5366
03:14:45,250 --> 03:14:46,810
Oh my god.

5367
03:14:47,210 --> 03:14:48,310
Oh, did you find my...

5368
03:14:48,310 --> 03:14:49,370
Wait, how are you so far...

5369
03:14:49,370 --> 03:14:50,090
I found your...

5370
03:14:50,090 --> 03:14:52,390
I found your cross section.

5371
03:14:53,390 --> 03:14:54,590
Oh, no, no.

5372
03:14:54,690 --> 03:14:56,150
I ran into your hole.

5373
03:14:57,430 --> 03:14:58,670
Ran into my hole?

5374
03:14:58,790 --> 03:15:00,510
Yeah, at one point I ran into your hole.

5375
03:15:01,550 --> 03:15:03,290
Yeah, but you're in the cross section.

5376
03:15:03,630 --> 03:15:04,930
Wait, why did you stop here?

5377
03:15:04,930 --> 03:15:07,050
Why did you go back here?

5378
03:15:08,190 --> 03:15:09,370
I just wasn't feeling it.

5379
03:15:09,430 --> 03:15:09,850
I don't know.

5380
03:15:10,970 --> 03:15:13,350
Oh my god, you stopped before you hit it big.

5381
03:15:13,650 --> 03:15:14,910
You're like those gamblers.

5382
03:15:15,790 --> 03:15:16,150
What?

5383
03:15:16,150 --> 03:15:17,030
Keep going then.

5384
03:15:17,130 --> 03:15:17,970
Did I hit it big there?

5385
03:15:18,110 --> 03:15:18,750
Did I miss out?

5386
03:15:19,030 --> 03:15:19,670
Alright, alright.

5387
03:15:19,750 --> 03:15:20,210
I'm gonna do it.

5388
03:15:20,410 --> 03:15:21,110
I'm gonna do it.

5389
03:15:21,210 --> 03:15:21,810
I'm gonna do it.

5390
03:15:21,910 --> 03:15:23,390
It wouldn't be funny if you missed out.

5391
03:15:23,570 --> 03:15:24,230
Maybe I did.

5392
03:15:24,330 --> 03:15:24,730
I don't know.

5393
03:15:24,870 --> 03:15:26,430
It would be so funny if you missed out.

5394
03:15:26,430 --> 03:15:26,930
We'll keep digging.

5395
03:15:31,870 --> 03:15:34,170
I'm gonna dig this hole and see if you missed out.

5396
03:15:37,930 --> 03:15:38,410
Okay.

5397
03:15:39,090 --> 03:15:39,950
Yeah, I'm digging.

5398
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:41,030
I'm digging your hole.

5399
03:15:41,270 --> 03:15:42,410
I'm digging the hole you fucking stopped at.

5400
03:15:42,430 --> 03:15:44,730
I mean, if you eventually get to something...

5401
03:15:44,730 --> 03:15:46,810
It has to be within like 5 hits.

5402
03:15:48,230 --> 03:15:49,050
5 hits?

5403
03:15:49,210 --> 03:15:49,510
Yeah.

5404
03:15:50,350 --> 03:15:51,010
5 hits.

5405
03:15:51,090 --> 03:15:52,570
So you're like, you know...

5406
03:15:52,570 --> 03:15:54,370
You're like changing the rules then.

5407
03:15:55,170 --> 03:15:55,590
What?

5408
03:15:55,630 --> 03:15:56,850
No, because it's...

5409
03:15:56,850 --> 03:15:57,990
That's the meme.

5410
03:15:58,090 --> 03:16:01,190
You hit it big right before you get to it.

5411
03:16:01,430 --> 03:16:04,670
It's not like you hit it big after like 50 hits.

5412
03:16:04,670 --> 03:16:06,050
That's just...anybody could do that.

5413
03:16:06,210 --> 03:16:06,930
No, no, no.

5414
03:16:07,150 --> 03:16:08,950
It means you gave up too early.

5415
03:16:10,290 --> 03:16:12,150
You just gave up so easily.

5416
03:16:13,310 --> 03:16:13,890
No, no.

5417
03:16:13,970 --> 03:16:14,710
That's not the meme.

5418
03:16:14,790 --> 03:16:17,810
The meme is literally he gave up right before he hit it big.

5419
03:16:17,830 --> 03:16:20,210
It doesn't matter because you're the one that gave up.

5420
03:16:20,350 --> 03:16:23,910
But anybody...you could give up literally any way.

5421
03:16:24,490 --> 03:16:25,550
Okay, you stop digging.

5422
03:16:25,730 --> 03:16:26,670
If I go to your...

5423
03:16:27,270 --> 03:16:29,690
If you go...if I go to your hole...

5424
03:16:29,690 --> 03:16:31,230
I stopped digging because I finished my task.

5425
03:16:32,050 --> 03:16:32,650
Oh, what is this?

5426
03:16:32,650 --> 03:16:33,310
Among Us now?

5427
03:16:33,390 --> 03:16:33,590
Okay.

5428
03:16:33,590 --> 03:16:34,810
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5429
03:16:35,050 --> 03:16:36,830
At least I finished it.

5430
03:16:38,330 --> 03:16:39,710
I finished my goal.

5431
03:16:40,050 --> 03:16:41,790
Somebody hasn't finished their fucking goal.

5432
03:16:41,790 --> 03:16:44,310
I just wanna find one more stack, okay?

5433
03:16:44,570 --> 03:16:44,910
God.

5434
03:16:50,950 --> 03:16:52,490
Hello, Redstone-do.

5435
03:16:52,850 --> 03:16:54,090
I'm almost at level 20.

5436
03:16:54,830 --> 03:16:55,290
Me too.

5437
03:16:56,690 --> 03:16:57,050
Oh, yeah?

5438
03:16:57,130 --> 03:16:57,730
What's your level?

5439
03:16:58,010 --> 03:16:58,550
19.

5440
03:16:59,910 --> 03:17:03,230
Just like you said, I'm almost at level 20.

5441
03:17:03,230 --> 03:17:04,430
Me too.

5442
03:17:05,150 --> 03:17:05,670
I don't know.

5443
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:06,670
It could be level 18.

5444
03:17:07,030 --> 03:17:07,470
I don't know.

5445
03:17:07,490 --> 03:17:08,930
Oh, so you're at level 18, huh?

5446
03:17:08,990 --> 03:17:09,350
Yeah, okay.

5447
03:17:09,490 --> 03:17:09,710
No, no.

5448
03:17:09,730 --> 03:17:10,510
I'm level 19.

5449
03:17:11,090 --> 03:17:13,330
I just thought you weren't good enough to be level 19.

5450
03:17:14,490 --> 03:17:14,850
Okay.

5451
03:17:15,950 --> 03:17:16,310
Yeah.

5452
03:17:22,990 --> 03:17:23,770
Oh my gosh.

5453
03:17:23,810 --> 03:17:24,930
How much more do I have to dig?

5454
03:17:25,470 --> 03:17:25,990
I don't know.

5455
03:17:26,110 --> 03:17:27,190
I'm digging your hole right now.

5456
03:17:27,190 --> 03:17:30,370
Why is it that I'm the one that's more sane than you?

5457
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:34,170
Because I know we're gonna die.

5458
03:17:35,450 --> 03:17:37,630
No, we have to beat this eventually.

5459
03:17:38,490 --> 03:17:40,150
No, I know this is not the run.

5460
03:17:40,450 --> 03:17:41,210
I know I'm...

5461
03:17:41,210 --> 03:17:42,570
What do you mean this is not the run?

5462
03:17:42,970 --> 03:17:46,230
You're still the young optimistic...

5463
03:17:46,230 --> 03:17:49,240
You're still young and optimistic, but I know...

5464
03:17:49,790 --> 03:17:51,950
I know we're gonna be doing this all over again.

5465
03:17:52,290 --> 03:17:53,550
I know this isn't it.

5466
03:17:54,730 --> 03:17:57,990
Is it because I only have 15 diamonds?

5467
03:18:01,630 --> 03:18:05,150
I know that I have to repeat this all over again.

5468
03:18:05,850 --> 03:18:09,270
Well, then you can find all the diamonds and...

5469
03:18:09,270 --> 03:18:10,670
Just give them to me.

5470
03:18:11,350 --> 03:18:13,090
Since you have better luck, right?

5471
03:18:13,450 --> 03:18:15,010
I thought this is a team game.

5472
03:18:15,290 --> 03:18:15,990
I thought...

5473
03:18:15,990 --> 03:18:17,870
Well, clearly I'm not doing well enough.

5474
03:18:18,230 --> 03:18:18,550
Mint!

5475
03:18:18,610 --> 03:18:18,610
Mint!

5476
03:18:18,730 --> 03:18:18,930
Mint!

5477
03:18:19,070 --> 03:18:19,830
I found diamonds.

5478
03:18:20,010 --> 03:18:21,230
I found diamonds in your hole.

5479
03:18:21,550 --> 03:18:22,450
I found diamonds.

5480
03:18:22,470 --> 03:18:24,950
Okay, but that was like 20 minutes later!

5481
03:18:25,370 --> 03:18:26,730
Oh my God!

5482
03:18:27,110 --> 03:18:27,970
It doesn't matter!

5483
03:18:27,970 --> 03:18:28,250
It doesn't matter!

5484
03:18:28,650 --> 03:18:30,510
It was so long ago!

5485
03:18:31,070 --> 03:18:33,030
You had to dig for so long!

5486
03:18:34,210 --> 03:18:35,630
You had to dig!

5487
03:18:35,750 --> 03:18:37,610
It was not right there.

5488
03:18:38,630 --> 03:18:39,150
Six!

5489
03:18:39,150 --> 03:18:41,930
Six diamonds in the hole you gave up on!

5490
03:18:42,890 --> 03:18:43,930
Six diamonds!

5491
03:18:46,590 --> 03:18:48,310
Well, then give them to me!

5492
03:18:48,750 --> 03:18:50,330
Then give them to me!

5493
03:18:50,550 --> 03:18:50,890
No!

5494
03:18:51,250 --> 03:18:53,610
This is to teach you a lesson to never give up.

5495
03:18:53,870 --> 03:18:54,470
You gave up.

5496
03:18:59,550 --> 03:19:00,610
I'm still going.

5497
03:19:01,030 --> 03:19:01,170
You gave up.

5498
03:19:02,310 --> 03:19:05,370
I didn't give up because I'm still here and I'm still digging.

5499
03:19:05,990 --> 03:19:07,030
I'm still digging.

5500
03:19:07,990 --> 03:19:08,390
Yeah!

5501
03:19:09,670 --> 03:19:13,170
I'm gonna go find another one of your pathways that you fucking gave up on.

5502
03:19:13,570 --> 03:19:14,330
Okay, do it.

5503
03:19:14,630 --> 03:19:15,490
Come find me.

5504
03:19:16,370 --> 03:19:17,290
You'll never find me.

5505
03:19:17,810 --> 03:19:18,770
You'll never find me.

5506
03:19:19,630 --> 03:19:21,010
I'll never find you.

5507
03:19:21,030 --> 03:19:22,090
I'm so fucking lost.

5508
03:19:22,190 --> 03:19:24,210
I don't even know which one was the hole I dug.

5509
03:19:25,010 --> 03:19:27,470
That could have even been your hole then!

5510
03:19:28,810 --> 03:19:31,170
It could have even been your hole!

5511
03:19:31,390 --> 03:19:32,870
No, it's your hole.

5512
03:19:33,290 --> 03:19:33,810
Hey Min!

5513
03:19:34,150 --> 03:19:37,110
Why do I have some wisps writing you out in my chat?

5514
03:19:39,410 --> 03:19:40,530
You guys!

5515
03:19:41,390 --> 03:19:42,530
I'm gonna dig up.

5516
03:19:42,630 --> 03:19:43,690
I'm gonna start digging up.

5517
03:19:43,810 --> 03:19:45,130
Somebody has a full set.

5518
03:19:45,690 --> 03:19:47,010
You motherfuckers!

5519
03:19:48,250 --> 03:19:51,630
I'm gonna meet you at the fucking surface you fucking whore!

5520
03:19:51,630 --> 03:19:52,010
Help!

5521
03:19:55,670 --> 03:19:56,170
Oh yeah!

5522
03:19:56,390 --> 03:19:57,510
So loyal!

5523
03:19:58,210 --> 03:19:59,710
So loyal!

5524
03:20:00,290 --> 03:20:00,890
No, no.

5525
03:20:00,970 --> 03:20:04,510
It has to be the dragoons coming over to see how much I had left.

5526
03:20:04,910 --> 03:20:08,710
It has to be the dragoons coming over to see how much I had left.

5527
03:20:08,730 --> 03:20:10,010
You mean the dragoons?

5528
03:20:10,070 --> 03:20:10,810
I'm fucking going.

5529
03:20:11,010 --> 03:20:12,150
I'll see you up in the surface.

5530
03:20:12,550 --> 03:20:13,790
I'll see you up on the surface.

5531
03:20:14,710 --> 03:20:15,770
Where are you?

5532
03:20:17,450 --> 03:20:19,550
Wait, I don't know where my... What's it called?

5533
03:20:21,650 --> 03:20:22,390
Crafting table.

5534
03:20:22,770 --> 03:20:23,690
Dragoons would never...

5535
03:20:24,190 --> 03:20:27,430
No, the dragoons are the ones that ratted me out.

5536
03:20:27,690 --> 03:20:29,770
No, dragoons would never...

5537
03:20:29,770 --> 03:20:30,830
How dare you guys.

5538
03:20:30,930 --> 03:20:31,410
How dare.

5539
03:20:31,850 --> 03:20:33,650
Dragoons would fucking never do that.

5540
03:20:33,710 --> 03:20:34,350
Who snitched?

5541
03:20:34,950 --> 03:20:35,910
Give me names.

5542
03:20:35,990 --> 03:20:37,050
Give me names right now.

5543
03:20:37,170 --> 03:20:38,770
I know all my wisps.

5544
03:20:38,870 --> 03:20:39,630
I'll be able to know.

5545
03:20:41,470 --> 03:20:43,130
I'll be able to...

5546
03:20:43,130 --> 03:20:44,190
Oh yeah?

5547
03:20:44,850 --> 03:20:46,330
Alright, alright, alright.

5548
03:20:46,970 --> 03:20:47,690
Let's see.

5549
03:20:48,590 --> 03:20:49,530
Who was it?

5550
03:20:49,530 --> 03:20:50,630
Who was it that snitched?

5551
03:20:50,630 --> 03:20:51,650
Who was it?

5552
03:20:51,670 --> 03:20:52,810
Who was it that snitched?

5553
03:20:54,030 --> 03:20:54,750
Aragon Battleborn.

5554
03:20:55,590 --> 03:20:56,650
That's a dragoon.

5555
03:20:56,730 --> 03:20:57,470
That is a dragoon.

5556
03:20:57,670 --> 03:21:00,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5557
03:21:00,270 --> 03:21:00,770
You know what?

5558
03:21:01,030 --> 03:21:02,790
I bet it's even a wisp-goon.

5559
03:21:03,350 --> 03:21:04,370
Oh, they're the worst.

5560
03:21:06,070 --> 03:21:06,790
You know what?

5561
03:21:07,250 --> 03:21:07,690
This person...

5562
03:21:08,410 --> 03:21:10,550
They're not even... They're not even a member.

5563
03:21:10,770 --> 03:21:12,030
But I bet they're a member in your chat.

5564
03:21:12,190 --> 03:21:13,230
Check if they're a member in your chat.

5565
03:21:13,330 --> 03:21:13,830
Check, check.

5566
03:21:14,010 --> 03:21:14,810
Where are you?

5567
03:21:14,810 --> 03:21:16,290
Show up on Ms. Chat right now.

5568
03:21:16,810 --> 03:21:18,230
I wanna see if you're a member.

5569
03:21:18,690 --> 03:21:20,370
I wanna see.

5570
03:21:20,430 --> 03:21:21,750
I mean, my...

5571
03:21:21,750 --> 03:21:23,510
No, no, no.

5572
03:21:23,930 --> 03:21:26,770
They were probably gifted a member if so.

5573
03:21:27,250 --> 03:21:28,450
They're a gifted...

5574
03:21:28,450 --> 03:21:30,130
Are they calling him a gifted member?

5575
03:21:30,130 --> 03:21:31,510
Show yourself, Aragon.

5576
03:21:32,010 --> 03:21:33,070
I can't see though.

5577
03:21:33,490 --> 03:21:34,050
Oh my god, no.

5578
03:21:34,170 --> 03:21:35,310
Stop gifting memberships.

5579
03:21:35,430 --> 03:21:35,890
Stop it.

5580
03:21:37,090 --> 03:21:37,530
Stop.

5581
03:21:39,670 --> 03:21:42,090
They said, I'm an SSRB.

5582
03:21:42,390 --> 03:21:42,970
What is that?

5583
03:21:43,070 --> 03:21:44,990
What is SSRB?

5584
03:21:45,370 --> 03:21:45,910
What is that?

5585
03:21:46,110 --> 03:21:46,650
Are they a member?

5586
03:21:46,790 --> 03:21:47,290
Are they a member?

5587
03:21:47,290 --> 03:21:49,110
No, they're not a member.

5588
03:21:49,830 --> 03:21:50,890
Okay, okay.

5589
03:21:51,730 --> 03:21:52,210
So...

5590
03:21:52,910 --> 03:21:54,470
They're like an inside job.

5591
03:21:54,750 --> 03:21:56,830
Oh, they're a fan of Botan.

5592
03:21:56,950 --> 03:21:58,010
You're not even watching.

5593
03:21:58,250 --> 03:21:59,030
This is...

5594
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:01,990
We're indies.

5595
03:22:02,090 --> 03:22:02,850
Get out of here.

5596
03:22:03,690 --> 03:22:04,950
It was a psychops.

5597
03:22:05,010 --> 03:22:06,290
It was a psychops.

5598
03:22:09,470 --> 03:22:12,050
It was a psychops all along.

5599
03:22:15,330 --> 03:22:18,870
What's so sad is that they wouldn't even say like, yeah, I'm a fan of you.

5600
03:22:22,130 --> 03:22:23,590
Not even for the bit.

5601
03:22:25,510 --> 03:22:26,330
Oh my gosh.

5602
03:22:26,330 --> 03:22:28,630
Oh my god, we're at minus 26 right now.

5603
03:22:28,710 --> 03:22:29,690
You're at minus 26?

5604
03:22:30,390 --> 03:22:35,250
I think the worst part... Oh my god, I hope we dig up to the fucking... Not to the mountain.

5605
03:22:35,370 --> 03:22:37,530
I hope we got out of the mountain area.

5606
03:22:38,130 --> 03:22:42,530
Well, once you get to something, just dig over.

5607
03:22:43,590 --> 03:22:45,570
Okay, I don't know if I'm in the mountain though.

5608
03:22:45,750 --> 03:22:47,430
Oh wait, I'm gonna start taking my torches back.

5609
03:22:48,770 --> 03:22:49,970
Are you not digging up?

5610
03:22:50,250 --> 03:22:53,050
No, I had to... I guess I could get some.

5611
03:22:53,110 --> 03:22:54,090
I could've done everything.

5612
03:22:54,650 --> 03:22:55,650
I'll dig eventually.

5613
03:22:57,770 --> 03:22:59,210
I'm waiting for you in the surface.

5614
03:23:01,430 --> 03:23:03,150
You're only prolonging your torture.

5615
03:23:04,050 --> 03:23:04,810
Your torture?

5616
03:23:04,950 --> 03:23:05,530
I'm fine.

5617
03:23:06,030 --> 03:23:07,370
You're only prolonged.

5618
03:23:07,370 --> 03:23:08,870
You think you're gonna be fine, Tia.

5619
03:23:08,970 --> 03:23:09,650
You think.

5620
03:23:10,130 --> 03:23:11,290
What do you mean by that?

5621
03:23:12,310 --> 03:23:20,630
You think you're gonna be fine and then we're gonna do like 20 more of this and then you're gonna be like, oh my god, Doki, why did I...

5622
03:23:21,830 --> 03:23:23,490
Okay, I'm getting to a safe spot.

5623
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:29,940
What did they say?

5624
03:23:30,560 --> 03:23:31,320
What did they say?

5625
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:33,860
Why are you saying LOL at them?

5626
03:23:35,120 --> 03:23:35,840
Wait, what?

5627
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:37,000
I don't know, my chat.

5628
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:40,300
No, like where did I dig to?

5629
03:23:40,620 --> 03:23:41,600
Is this another cave?

5630
03:23:42,480 --> 03:23:43,780
Uh-oh, don't die.

5631
03:23:44,640 --> 03:23:45,600
You better not die.

5632
03:23:45,920 --> 03:23:47,420
You have golden armor, I mean diamond armor.

5633
03:23:47,640 --> 03:23:47,960
You're good.

5634
03:23:48,500 --> 03:23:52,460
Oh, now you don't want to prolong this to another... You don't want to prolong this?

5635
03:23:52,540 --> 03:23:53,160
What happened, man?

5636
03:23:53,220 --> 03:23:54,660
I thought you wanted to do more of mining.

5637
03:23:54,780 --> 03:23:56,920
No, we're still playing.

5638
03:23:57,620 --> 03:24:00,320
I thought you loved mining.

5639
03:24:00,720 --> 03:24:05,040
Oh, you left some sweet, sweet experience.

5640
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:07,620
Oh, wow, there's a lot here, actually.

5641
03:24:08,620 --> 03:24:10,580
You left all the redstone.

5642
03:24:11,900 --> 03:24:14,460
Oh, no, not the fucking redstone.

5643
03:24:14,620 --> 03:24:15,900
Oh, no.

5644
03:24:18,020 --> 03:24:19,580
Doki, you're still alive.

5645
03:24:19,580 --> 03:24:20,380
Okay, diamond armor.

5646
03:24:20,640 --> 03:24:21,180
You're alive.

5647
03:24:21,260 --> 03:24:21,800
You're alive.

5648
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:22,420
You're alive.

5649
03:24:22,500 --> 03:24:23,000
You're alive.

5650
03:24:23,440 --> 03:24:28,200
I just took a creeper hit in the face, but like I'm...

5651
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:29,500
You have a shield?

5652
03:24:29,700 --> 03:24:30,680
You also have a shield?

5653
03:24:30,960 --> 03:24:34,100
Yeah, but I have my pickaxe and torches out, but it's okay.

5654
03:24:34,100 --> 03:24:38,580
Oh, gosh, I'm scared to go up like this, man.

5655
03:24:39,260 --> 03:24:39,800
It's okay.

5656
03:24:39,880 --> 03:24:41,220
Everything is fine.

5657
03:24:41,500 --> 03:24:45,700
I took a creeper shot to the face, but it's okay.

5658
03:24:46,320 --> 03:24:47,060
You're fine.

5659
03:24:47,140 --> 03:24:48,060
Probably, it's fine.

5660
03:24:49,860 --> 03:24:50,680
It's probably fine.

5661
03:24:53,580 --> 03:24:56,060
I took two creeper hits in the face, by the way.

5662
03:24:56,280 --> 03:24:57,940
Why don't you use your shield?

5663
03:25:01,340 --> 03:25:02,400
You know what?

5664
03:25:02,480 --> 03:25:03,460
I'm not scared anymore.

5665
03:25:03,580 --> 03:25:04,560
I literally took two creeper...

5666
03:25:04,560 --> 03:25:07,620
I took two creeper hits in the face and I'm okay.

5667
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:10,120
That's why we get the armor.

5668
03:25:10,300 --> 03:25:12,540
See, you were like, oh, I want to do this with iron.

5669
03:25:12,800 --> 03:25:13,820
No, no, no.

5670
03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:16,740
Look at that.

5671
03:25:19,060 --> 03:25:22,840
Yeah, this is why we do things with diamond armor, duh.

5672
03:25:23,660 --> 03:25:26,540
Yeah, but like... Oh, my God, I thought that was a creeper again.

5673
03:25:26,740 --> 03:25:27,300
I don't know.

5674
03:25:27,300 --> 03:25:29,420
I'm fucking seeing things now.

5675
03:25:29,640 --> 03:25:31,740
I'm seeing things, guys.

5676
03:25:32,380 --> 03:25:34,420
When I leave here, I'm sick of mining.

5677
03:25:35,320 --> 03:25:37,360
Oh, now you're sick of mining.

5678
03:25:40,140 --> 03:25:43,440
Maya, you're so sick of mining now.

5679
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:44,980
I hate mining up.

5680
03:25:45,060 --> 03:25:45,540
It's boring.

5681
03:25:51,980 --> 03:25:53,480
Oh, my God.

5682
03:25:54,040 --> 03:25:55,620
I don't even know where I am.

5683
03:25:59,100 --> 03:25:59,460
Oh...

5684
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:00,600
Witch giggles?

5685
03:26:00,860 --> 03:26:01,380
Oh, shit.

5686
03:26:01,540 --> 03:26:02,580
Okay, I might be in trouble.

5687
03:26:02,980 --> 03:26:03,300
Uh-oh.

5688
03:26:03,960 --> 03:26:05,720
Wait, are you... Do you have subtitles on?

5689
03:26:05,960 --> 03:26:06,620
Yeah, of course.

5690
03:26:06,900 --> 03:26:07,720
Oh, I should have that.

5691
03:26:09,180 --> 03:26:10,300
I should have that too.

5692
03:26:10,300 --> 03:26:11,440
Yeah, you should have that.

5693
03:26:12,660 --> 03:26:13,800
Where's the subtitles at?

5694
03:26:13,880 --> 03:26:14,440
Chat settings?

5695
03:26:15,060 --> 03:26:15,420
No.

5696
03:26:15,580 --> 03:26:16,180
I don't remember.

5697
03:26:16,640 --> 03:26:17,580
I don't remember, guys.

5698
03:26:17,900 --> 03:26:18,260
Accessibility?

5699
03:26:18,460 --> 03:26:19,100
Oh, there you go.

5700
03:26:19,380 --> 03:26:19,700
Uh-oh.

5701
03:26:19,960 --> 03:26:20,580
Oh, shit.

5702
03:26:20,660 --> 03:26:21,060
I'm in trouble.

5703
03:26:21,080 --> 03:26:21,540
That's a good idea.

5704
03:26:22,240 --> 03:26:23,740
Okay, I gotta get out of here.

5705
03:26:25,140 --> 03:26:25,580
Okay.

5706
03:26:26,540 --> 03:26:27,900
I'm at negative 42.

5707
03:26:28,460 --> 03:26:30,120
You're at negative 42?

5708
03:26:30,520 --> 03:26:31,620
I'm at 33.

5709
03:26:32,400 --> 03:26:33,780
I'm in a bad spot.

5710
03:26:33,980 --> 03:26:34,620
I'm like...

5711
03:26:34,620 --> 03:26:35,020
Oh, my God.

5712
03:26:35,040 --> 03:26:36,160
There's a witch right next to me.

5713
03:26:36,300 --> 03:26:36,920
Oh, shit.

5714
03:26:37,300 --> 03:26:38,720
Okay, am I like...

5715
03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:40,320
Shouldn't I be in the surface now?

5716
03:26:40,820 --> 03:26:41,640
I'm at 33.

5717
03:26:41,640 --> 03:26:43,320
You're probably... We're in the mountain.

5718
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:45,940
We're still in the fucking mountain?

5719
03:26:46,340 --> 03:26:46,720
Probably.

5720
03:26:47,060 --> 03:26:48,300
Just dig to the side.

5721
03:26:49,860 --> 03:26:51,900
Actually, 33 is not very high.

5722
03:26:51,900 --> 03:26:53,700
Okay, maybe, you know...

5723
03:26:53,700 --> 03:26:55,620
Wait, I found... Wait, there's like...

5724
03:26:55,620 --> 03:26:56,320
Not found.

5725
03:26:56,440 --> 03:26:58,020
There's like dirt in front of me.

5726
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:00,080
Oh, see?

5727
03:27:00,220 --> 03:27:00,880
Then you might be good.

5728
03:27:01,480 --> 03:27:02,360
Might be close, then.

5729
03:27:03,800 --> 03:27:05,100
Never mind, the dirt stopped.

5730
03:27:05,940 --> 03:27:06,780
The dirt stopped.

5731
03:27:06,800 --> 03:27:08,300
Oh, surface is at 60+.

5732
03:27:08,300 --> 03:27:08,760
Keep going.

5733
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:10,280
Oh, God.

5734
03:27:11,160 --> 03:27:11,760
Fucking... Okay.

5735
03:27:14,140 --> 03:27:15,040
Okay, maybe I'm good.

5736
03:27:17,660 --> 03:27:18,420
Maybe I'm okay.

5737
03:27:20,300 --> 03:27:21,360
Oh, my God.

5738
03:27:25,790 --> 03:27:26,630
You're gonna what?

5739
03:27:26,810 --> 03:27:27,410
What are you gonna do?

5740
03:27:27,570 --> 03:27:28,750
I'm gonna cry.

5741
03:27:31,710 --> 03:27:33,850
You won't like it when I cry.

5742
03:27:36,330 --> 03:27:37,750
What does that mean?

5743
03:27:38,710 --> 03:27:40,150
It'll be too real.

5744
03:27:40,650 --> 03:27:42,130
It'll be too real?

5745
03:27:44,030 --> 03:27:44,790
Oh, cry.

5746
03:27:45,290 --> 03:27:45,710
Oh, shit.

5747
03:27:45,790 --> 03:27:46,550
That's another room.

5748
03:27:46,670 --> 03:27:47,230
Oh, my God.

5749
03:27:47,310 --> 03:27:47,690
No.

5750
03:27:48,150 --> 03:27:49,830
Get me out of these stupid ass rooms.

5751
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:54,880
Oh, my God.

5752
03:27:54,960 --> 03:27:55,680
I hear the witch still.

5753
03:27:55,800 --> 03:27:56,000
No!

5754
03:27:56,600 --> 03:27:58,720
How do you still hear the witch?

5755
03:27:59,500 --> 03:28:00,860
I'm trying to get out of here.

5756
03:28:02,240 --> 03:28:03,920
I'm like digging around.

5757
03:28:04,060 --> 03:28:05,600
I'm strip mining again.

5758
03:28:07,220 --> 03:28:08,000
Oh, diamond.

5759
03:28:12,500 --> 03:28:14,180
I'm trying to get out of here.

5760
03:28:14,520 --> 03:28:15,380
I'm trying!

5761
03:28:16,500 --> 03:28:18,820
Your grandchildren will live in these mines.

5762
03:28:19,260 --> 03:28:19,520
It's okay.

5763
03:28:19,600 --> 03:28:20,800
I got a lot of diamond here.

5764
03:28:21,380 --> 03:28:23,420
It would be a shame if you died.

5765
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:28,680
You know what?

5766
03:28:28,720 --> 03:28:29,800
I'm just gonna build a staircase.

5767
03:28:30,360 --> 03:28:30,840
That'll be easier.

5768
03:28:32,060 --> 03:28:32,640
Oh, shit.

5769
03:28:32,820 --> 03:28:33,080
Oh, shit.

5770
03:28:33,340 --> 03:28:33,340
Oh, shit.

5771
03:28:33,680 --> 03:28:33,860
Oh, no.

5772
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:34,780
Never mind.

5773
03:28:35,200 --> 03:28:35,460
Never mind.

5774
03:28:36,300 --> 03:28:39,240
Oh, look at that.

5775
03:28:39,800 --> 03:28:41,060
I see you on the surface.

5776
03:28:41,520 --> 03:28:43,320
I see you on the surface.

5777
03:28:43,720 --> 03:28:44,640
I'm almost there.

5778
03:28:45,140 --> 03:28:46,320
I'm almost there.

5779
03:28:46,440 --> 03:28:47,920
I am at...

5780
03:28:47,920 --> 03:28:48,640
62.

5781
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:51,340
Shit.

5782
03:28:51,840 --> 03:28:53,980
I don't want to be in here by myself.

5783
03:28:54,940 --> 03:28:56,820
Maybe you shouldn't have been...

5784
03:28:56,820 --> 03:28:58,960
Maybe you shouldn't have fucked with me, man.

5785
03:28:59,300 --> 03:29:02,600
Maybe you should pretend that you didn't have any diamonds on you.

5786
03:29:03,760 --> 03:29:05,520
You should have come found me.

5787
03:29:05,640 --> 03:29:07,320
You said you were going to happen.

5788
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:10,260
You lied.

5789
03:29:14,020 --> 03:29:16,680
I keep hitting... I just keep hitting cave.

5790
03:29:17,080 --> 03:29:17,740
Cave, stop!

5791
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:18,240
That's karma.

5792
03:29:18,580 --> 03:29:20,140
That's actually karma.

5793
03:29:24,540 --> 03:29:25,400
Little by little.

5794
03:29:25,660 --> 03:29:27,240
I can't always hit a cave.

5795
03:29:27,900 --> 03:29:28,920
Right, guys?

5796
03:29:31,460 --> 03:29:32,320
Little by little.

5797
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:33,340
Little by little.

5798
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:34,940
It'll be a shame.

5799
03:29:35,160 --> 03:29:36,060
It'll be a shame.

5800
03:29:36,560 --> 03:29:36,800
What?

5801
03:29:36,820 --> 03:29:37,360
You want me to die?

5802
03:29:37,480 --> 03:29:37,940
I will.

5803
03:29:38,920 --> 03:29:39,540
Do it.

5804
03:29:40,160 --> 03:29:40,880
Do you want me to?

5805
03:29:40,940 --> 03:29:41,540
I asked you.

5806
03:29:41,980 --> 03:29:42,480
Do it.

5807
03:29:42,880 --> 03:29:43,500
Do it.

5808
03:29:43,560 --> 03:29:44,200
No, no, no.

5809
03:29:44,400 --> 03:29:45,000
Come on.

5810
03:29:45,100 --> 03:29:45,780
I don't want to.

5811
03:29:45,980 --> 03:29:46,540
I don't want to.

5812
03:29:46,540 --> 03:29:47,020
Oh, yeah.

5813
03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:47,440
See?

5814
03:29:47,640 --> 03:29:49,020
I fucking knew you wouldn't.

5815
03:29:49,080 --> 03:29:49,540
I'm a ghost.

5816
03:29:49,640 --> 03:29:50,200
I'm already dead.

5817
03:29:50,280 --> 03:29:51,560
I want to appreciate life.

5818
03:29:51,680 --> 03:29:53,020
You don't appreciate life.

5819
03:29:54,080 --> 03:29:56,400
You just want me to waste my...

5820
03:29:56,400 --> 03:29:58,680
Oh, I don't appreciate life.

5821
03:29:59,100 --> 03:29:59,780
I'm almost there.

5822
03:29:59,900 --> 03:30:00,880
Like, calm down.

5823
03:30:01,120 --> 03:30:01,840
I'm at like 20.

5824
03:30:01,880 --> 03:30:02,200
What number?

5825
03:30:02,540 --> 03:30:02,900
20.

5826
03:30:09,030 --> 03:30:10,210
I'm at level 20.

5827
03:30:10,950 --> 03:30:11,190
What?

5828
03:30:11,270 --> 03:30:11,930
Why are you at 20?

5829
03:30:12,430 --> 03:30:13,350
No, I'm at level.

5830
03:30:13,850 --> 03:30:14,950
I'm talking about leveling.

5831
03:30:15,290 --> 03:30:16,730
No, I was talking about...

5832
03:30:16,730 --> 03:30:17,290
I know.

5833
03:30:17,630 --> 03:30:18,650
I'm at level 21.

5834
03:30:18,830 --> 03:30:19,530
Oh my god.

5835
03:30:21,830 --> 03:30:23,390
Well, I was testing you.

5836
03:30:23,550 --> 03:30:25,090
I was actually level 22.

5837
03:30:28,950 --> 03:30:31,070
Okay, let's from now on...

5838
03:30:31,070 --> 03:30:31,810
No lying.

5839
03:30:32,170 --> 03:30:33,830
We're teamwork, okay?

5840
03:30:33,930 --> 03:30:35,190
That's a fucking lie already.

5841
03:30:35,210 --> 03:30:36,130
What do you mean?

5842
03:30:36,430 --> 03:30:37,790
No, we're teamwork.

5843
03:30:38,490 --> 03:30:39,510
We're teamwork.

5844
03:30:39,830 --> 03:30:40,830
Make the dream work.

5845
03:30:40,950 --> 03:30:43,330
Let's not lie, guys.

5846
03:30:44,050 --> 03:30:45,430
And I didn't lie.

5847
03:30:45,590 --> 03:30:47,530
I just didn't tell you...

5848
03:30:47,530 --> 03:30:48,510
how much I had.

5849
03:30:49,350 --> 03:30:50,930
You assumed every time.

5850
03:30:51,110 --> 03:30:52,190
I asked you.

5851
03:30:52,290 --> 03:30:53,470
I literally asked you.

5852
03:30:53,550 --> 03:30:55,790
You would ask me and I wouldn't say anything.

5853
03:30:56,130 --> 03:30:59,550
And then you would say, you still have 15.

5854
03:30:59,910 --> 03:31:00,870
And you're like, yeah.

5855
03:31:01,210 --> 03:31:02,450
And I was like, oh my god.

5856
03:31:02,670 --> 03:31:05,250
Okay, I think at the time though, I did have 15.

5857
03:31:05,790 --> 03:31:06,710
I'm at the surface.

5858
03:31:06,970 --> 03:31:08,030
I'm literally... I'm here.

5859
03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:09,090
I'm almost there.

5860
03:31:09,170 --> 03:31:10,030
Oh my gosh.

5861
03:31:10,290 --> 03:31:10,770
No, you're not.

5862
03:31:10,910 --> 03:31:11,410
No, you're not.

5863
03:31:11,490 --> 03:31:12,310
Yes, I am.

5864
03:31:12,310 --> 03:31:13,390
No, you're not.

5865
03:31:13,510 --> 03:31:13,870
What number?

5866
03:31:13,990 --> 03:31:14,330
What number?

5867
03:31:15,010 --> 03:31:17,050
I'm at 2.

5868
03:31:19,470 --> 03:31:20,090
What are you at?

5869
03:31:20,090 --> 03:31:21,490
Didn't you say you were at 20 earlier?

5870
03:31:21,670 --> 03:31:22,330
Didn't you tell me?

5871
03:31:22,370 --> 03:31:23,590
So you lied and...

5872
03:31:23,590 --> 03:31:25,190
No, I said negative 20.

5873
03:31:25,570 --> 03:31:26,990
Oh, I hit not big rock.

5874
03:31:27,050 --> 03:31:27,650
Okay, yay.

5875
03:31:28,470 --> 03:31:29,610
Or the regular rocks.

5876
03:31:30,690 --> 03:31:32,030
I still go so much faster now.

5877
03:31:32,710 --> 03:31:34,030
Do you have a bed on you?

5878
03:31:34,430 --> 03:31:34,850
A bed?

5879
03:31:35,530 --> 03:31:35,850
Yeah.

5880
03:31:36,830 --> 03:31:37,910
Okay, it's almost night.

5881
03:31:38,030 --> 03:31:38,290
It's night.

5882
03:31:38,350 --> 03:31:39,330
Yeah, you gotta sleep now.

5883
03:31:39,390 --> 03:31:40,030
Okay, I'll sleep.

5884
03:31:40,190 --> 03:31:40,370
I'll sleep.

5885
03:31:41,910 --> 03:31:42,870
I'm sleeping.

5886
03:31:43,050 --> 03:31:44,090
Why aren't you sleeping?

5887
03:31:44,710 --> 03:31:45,370
Oh, there you go.

5888
03:31:46,590 --> 03:31:47,030
I'm sleeping.

5889
03:31:47,550 --> 03:31:47,930
Sleep.

5890
03:31:48,370 --> 03:31:50,270
Also, you didn't say negative 20, by the way.

5891
03:31:50,610 --> 03:31:51,570
You said 20.

5892
03:31:53,310 --> 03:31:54,930
You said 20.

5893
03:31:55,690 --> 03:31:59,890
Doki, may I remind you, you wanted to do this collab with me.

5894
03:32:01,130 --> 03:32:03,150
Might I remind you, this was...

5895
03:32:03,150 --> 03:32:07,010
Might I remind you that you were very excited to do this.

5896
03:32:07,090 --> 03:32:07,450
I am.

5897
03:32:07,530 --> 03:32:08,270
I'm still excited.

5898
03:32:08,590 --> 03:32:09,410
Are you not excited?

5899
03:32:09,410 --> 03:32:10,710
I'm so...

5900
03:32:10,710 --> 03:32:12,230
You're the one who's crying.

5901
03:32:12,590 --> 03:32:14,270
I'm so... I'm so excited.

5902
03:32:15,150 --> 03:32:16,850
I'm so excited.

5903
03:32:18,770 --> 03:32:19,390
Let's see.

5904
03:32:19,470 --> 03:32:21,250
I'm at... 11.

5905
03:32:21,830 --> 03:32:22,570
I'm almost there.

5906
03:32:25,570 --> 03:32:29,290
I'm at... I was at 101 to get here.

5907
03:32:29,930 --> 03:32:30,530
Oh, shit.

5908
03:32:30,910 --> 03:32:31,730
We're on a mountain.

5909
03:32:32,270 --> 03:32:33,210
I'm digging probably...

5910
03:32:33,210 --> 03:32:34,030
You might not be, actually.

5911
03:32:34,210 --> 03:32:34,850
You might not be.

5912
03:32:34,930 --> 03:32:36,930
You might have dug further away from me.

5913
03:32:37,110 --> 03:32:38,070
I think... Oh, oh, wait.

5914
03:32:39,150 --> 03:32:41,150
What's your... What's your other... Wait.

5915
03:32:41,690 --> 03:32:42,270
I don't wanna go through.

5916
03:32:42,430 --> 03:32:45,150
What's your X and Z?

5917
03:32:46,030 --> 03:32:46,470
Hold on.

5918
03:32:46,970 --> 03:32:48,270
I think... Oh, that was water dripping.

5919
03:32:48,770 --> 03:32:50,470
I'm at...

5920
03:32:52,110 --> 03:32:56,270
Negative 3558 and 1771, but I'm having to change it.

5921
03:32:58,770 --> 03:32:59,210
3558.

5922
03:32:59,510 --> 03:33:00,710
Guys, remember that for me.

5923
03:33:01,270 --> 03:33:03,590
Well, I'm digging, like, not up up.

5924
03:33:03,970 --> 03:33:07,290
I'm digging through... I'm digging, like, what's it called?

5925
03:33:07,290 --> 03:33:08,510
A staircase.

5926
03:33:09,910 --> 03:33:10,970
Wait, what's your Z again?

5927
03:33:11,490 --> 03:33:11,770
No!

5928
03:33:14,990 --> 03:33:16,470
Guys, what's your Z, guys?

5929
03:33:16,670 --> 03:33:17,330
What's your Z?

5930
03:33:17,710 --> 03:33:18,230
My Z?

5931
03:33:19,130 --> 03:33:19,470
Yeah.

5932
03:33:19,630 --> 03:33:20,090
I don't know.

5933
03:33:20,190 --> 03:33:20,630
Hold on.

5934
03:33:23,350 --> 03:33:24,230
Uh, 1771.

5935
03:33:25,170 --> 03:33:25,610
Okay.

5936
03:33:26,190 --> 03:33:27,250
I need to go this way, then.

5937
03:33:28,090 --> 03:33:29,050
Yeah, you're far.

5938
03:33:29,310 --> 03:33:30,490
Oh, hey, there's...

5939
03:33:30,490 --> 03:33:30,890
No!

5940
03:33:31,370 --> 03:33:33,370
I threw away my bombs!

5941
03:33:35,250 --> 03:33:36,410
Could've grabbed a dog.

5942
03:33:36,410 --> 03:33:37,550
You could've grabbed a dog.

5943
03:33:37,610 --> 03:33:39,870
Oh, I don't... I'm afraid of towering from here.

5944
03:33:40,170 --> 03:33:41,710
What if there's someone up there?

5945
03:33:41,830 --> 03:33:42,250
Oh my God.

5946
03:33:42,270 --> 03:33:43,890
Oh my God, you're so far.

5947
03:33:45,730 --> 03:33:46,530
I'm scared.

5948
03:33:46,790 --> 03:33:47,790
Okay, I'll do a little bit.

5949
03:33:50,030 --> 03:33:51,330
Oh, I hit...

5950
03:33:51,330 --> 03:33:54,310
Yeah, you might not hit the mountain, because you're really far.

5951
03:33:54,470 --> 03:33:54,930
I am?

5952
03:33:55,810 --> 03:33:57,370
Yeah, you're far from where I dug up.

5953
03:33:57,430 --> 03:33:57,730
Okay.

5954
03:33:58,710 --> 03:33:59,630
Do it before they spawn?

5955
03:33:59,750 --> 03:34:00,090
Oh, God.

5956
03:34:02,210 --> 03:34:02,970
I'm trying.

5957
03:34:03,370 --> 03:34:03,930
I'm trying.

5958
03:34:04,090 --> 03:34:05,030
I'm getting more... You know what?

5959
03:34:05,070 --> 03:34:06,350
I'm just gonna... It's fine.

5960
03:34:06,490 --> 03:34:07,270
We can do here.

5961
03:34:08,270 --> 03:34:09,270
First, I'll grab the iron.

5962
03:34:10,630 --> 03:34:11,970
I can staircase from here.

5963
03:34:12,510 --> 03:34:13,350
I can staircase from here.

5964
03:34:14,970 --> 03:34:16,070
I'm heading over.

5965
03:34:16,910 --> 03:34:19,070
I'm heading over to where you're gonna show up.

5966
03:34:19,170 --> 03:34:21,530
I might be different, though, because I'm staircasing.

5967
03:34:22,430 --> 03:34:25,570
Are you not staircasing, like, the same direction?

5968
03:34:25,930 --> 03:34:28,350
I have to switch, because I just hit a big cave.

5969
03:34:28,850 --> 03:34:30,230
Okay, what's your number now?

5970
03:34:31,910 --> 03:34:33,830
I'm heading towards...

5971
03:34:36,190 --> 03:34:36,570
1767.

5972
03:34:38,130 --> 03:34:38,510
1767.

5973
03:34:38,730 --> 03:34:40,210
No, I'm still heading the right way.

5974
03:34:40,430 --> 03:34:42,470
I'm like 1767.

5975
03:34:42,670 --> 03:34:42,850
Okay.

5976
03:34:44,010 --> 03:34:45,330
Okay, you might actually dig a mountain.

5977
03:34:45,470 --> 03:34:46,670
Oh, you're on top of a mountain.

5978
03:34:48,170 --> 03:34:49,510
Am I in the mountain?

5979
03:34:50,070 --> 03:34:50,970
You're in the mountain.

5980
03:34:51,150 --> 03:34:51,730
You're in the mountain.

5981
03:34:51,930 --> 03:34:53,770
You're in the big ass mountain.

5982
03:34:53,770 --> 03:34:54,730
I'm at 34.

5983
03:34:54,730 --> 03:34:55,110
I'm at 34.

5984
03:34:56,970 --> 03:34:57,850
I'm climbing.

5985
03:34:58,050 --> 03:34:59,050
It's 99.

5986
03:35:02,530 --> 03:35:04,010
You might need to get out of that.

5987
03:35:04,750 --> 03:35:05,350
I'm climbing.

5988
03:35:05,470 --> 03:35:06,110
I'm climbing, too.

5989
03:35:06,250 --> 03:35:06,790
I'm climbing, too.

5990
03:35:06,890 --> 03:35:07,330
Oh, shit.

5991
03:35:07,730 --> 03:35:10,010
Goddammit, this stupid ass cave.

5992
03:35:13,050 --> 03:35:13,930
You're actually...

5993
03:35:13,930 --> 03:35:14,590
Wait.

5994
03:35:15,910 --> 03:35:17,790
Oh, I see the surface, kind of.

5995
03:35:20,350 --> 03:35:23,030
Okay, yeah, you're literally on top of a mountain.

5996
03:35:24,010 --> 03:35:26,950
On top of a mountain.

5997
03:35:28,290 --> 03:35:30,770
All covered in cheese.

5998
03:35:31,910 --> 03:35:36,810
By the way, you have to dig 133 if you want to get out.

5999
03:35:37,390 --> 03:35:38,510
I'm at 47.

6000
03:35:39,010 --> 03:35:39,690
I'm close.

6001
03:35:41,130 --> 03:35:41,130
I'm close.

6002
03:35:41,130 --> 03:35:41,510
I'm close.

6003
03:35:41,670 --> 03:35:41,910
I'm close.

6004
03:35:42,090 --> 03:35:42,310
I'm close.

6005
03:35:42,710 --> 03:35:44,870
I'll wait for you at the top of the mountain.

6006
03:35:45,010 --> 03:35:45,190
Okay.

6007
03:35:45,370 --> 03:35:45,570
Okay.

6008
03:35:45,890 --> 03:35:45,890
Okay.

6009
03:35:48,010 --> 03:35:49,570
Wait, where are you at?

6010
03:35:49,750 --> 03:35:51,490
I'm at 1757.

6011
03:35:51,490 --> 03:35:53,330
Oh, my God.

6012
03:35:54,550 --> 03:35:55,230
1757.

6013
03:35:56,090 --> 03:35:56,710
Let's see.

6014
03:35:56,850 --> 03:35:59,270
17... Yeah, I'm at 17... What's your X again?

6015
03:36:00,850 --> 03:36:02,210
Negative 3579.

6016
03:36:03,810 --> 03:36:05,590
Are you right there?

6017
03:36:10,510 --> 03:36:12,130
Guys, what was the Z again?

6018
03:36:15,270 --> 03:36:16,450
What's the Z?

6019
03:36:18,890 --> 03:36:19,330
What?

6020
03:36:19,790 --> 03:36:20,930
Are you right on top of me?

6021
03:36:23,250 --> 03:36:23,810
Oh, it's okay.

6022
03:36:23,890 --> 03:36:24,410
I'm at 60.

6023
03:36:24,590 --> 03:36:25,430
I'm almost there.

6024
03:36:27,950 --> 03:36:28,990
I'm almost there!

6025
03:36:29,910 --> 03:36:31,010
I'm almost there!

6026
03:36:33,390 --> 03:36:35,670
Yeah, you're definitely almost there.

6027
03:36:35,890 --> 03:36:37,190
I'm playing the game.

6028
03:36:37,310 --> 03:36:37,510
Why?

6029
03:36:37,570 --> 03:36:38,230
Does it get higher?

6030
03:36:38,650 --> 03:36:42,150
Wait, what's your X and Y?

6031
03:36:43,290 --> 03:36:44,350
I'm not telling you anymore.

6032
03:36:44,350 --> 03:36:46,310
What do you mean?

6033
03:36:47,010 --> 03:36:48,070
You're gonna make fun of me.

6034
03:36:54,470 --> 03:36:55,590
I'm almost there!

6035
03:36:56,450 --> 03:36:57,770
I can feel it.

6036
03:36:58,770 --> 03:37:00,030
I can feel it.

6037
03:37:00,130 --> 03:37:01,430
Yeah, you can feel it.

6038
03:37:01,470 --> 03:37:02,770
I'm over halfway.

6039
03:37:03,710 --> 03:37:05,850
What's your Y?

6040
03:37:07,710 --> 03:37:11,290
If I keep stopping to tell you, I won't keep digging.

6041
03:37:15,610 --> 03:37:16,210
Nice.

6042
03:37:16,690 --> 03:37:18,230
I got lots of coal.

6043
03:37:20,470 --> 03:37:22,670
Oh my God, this is a lot of coal.

6044
03:37:23,030 --> 03:37:23,850
Holy moly.

6045
03:37:24,430 --> 03:37:25,310
Holy coley.

6046
03:37:28,670 --> 03:37:31,510
Oh my gosh, there's so much coal here!

6047
03:37:34,930 --> 03:37:36,350
Oh my God.

6048
03:37:37,050 --> 03:37:38,290
There's so much coal.

6049
03:37:38,470 --> 03:37:39,790
Okay, I'm level 50 now.

6050
03:37:44,530 --> 03:37:45,010
What?

6051
03:37:45,010 --> 03:37:45,490
What?

6052
03:37:47,910 --> 03:37:49,030
I'll give up.

6053
03:37:49,230 --> 03:37:49,610
What?

6054
03:37:49,750 --> 03:37:51,330
Why are you giving up?

6055
03:37:52,450 --> 03:37:52,930
What?

6056
03:37:53,590 --> 03:37:57,010
I don't even need to do what I was doing.

6057
03:37:57,290 --> 03:37:59,110
I still have a long way to go.

6058
03:38:00,070 --> 03:38:01,170
I'm almost there!

6059
03:38:02,390 --> 03:38:04,690
Oh yeah, that's why I'm not telling you my location.

6060
03:38:04,910 --> 03:38:06,290
Because that's what you'll fucking do.

6061
03:38:08,050 --> 03:38:09,410
You'll sabotage me!

6062
03:38:09,530 --> 03:38:11,050
How would I sabotage you?

6063
03:38:11,070 --> 03:38:12,710
You already sabotaged yourself!

6064
03:38:12,890 --> 03:38:14,230
How did I sabotage myself?

6065
03:38:14,770 --> 03:38:17,290
You already sabotaged... You'll find out.

6066
03:38:17,490 --> 03:38:19,630
You'll find out when you get to the top.

6067
03:38:20,030 --> 03:38:20,810
Oh, is it night time?

6068
03:38:22,890 --> 03:38:24,490
No, that's not it.

6069
03:38:24,990 --> 03:38:26,110
That's not it.

6070
03:38:26,270 --> 03:38:26,490
What?

6071
03:38:26,750 --> 03:38:27,630
Am I underwater?

6072
03:38:28,850 --> 03:38:30,570
No, you'll find out.

6073
03:38:31,710 --> 03:38:34,270
You'll find out when you get to the top.

6074
03:38:38,810 --> 03:38:41,470
How much are you adding to the top of the mountain?

6075
03:38:42,010 --> 03:38:43,390
I don't need to.

6076
03:38:45,070 --> 03:38:46,110
What do you mean?

6077
03:38:46,390 --> 03:38:47,930
You don't even know where I am!

6078
03:38:48,230 --> 03:38:49,150
Yes, I do.

6079
03:38:49,190 --> 03:38:50,130
No, you don't!

6080
03:38:50,430 --> 03:38:51,470
Yes, I do.

6081
03:38:51,730 --> 03:38:54,410
I don't need to.

6082
03:38:55,490 --> 03:38:57,310
You don't even know where I am!

6083
03:38:58,730 --> 03:39:00,090
Alright, what's your why?

6084
03:39:00,330 --> 03:39:00,790
What's your why?

6085
03:39:00,790 --> 03:39:02,830
I'm not telling you anything because you have...

6086
03:39:02,830 --> 03:39:04,590
I can't do anything with the why.

6087
03:39:04,730 --> 03:39:06,250
I can't do anything with the why.

6088
03:39:06,410 --> 03:39:10,850
You have sneaky people who are telling me...

6089
03:39:10,850 --> 03:39:12,330
Telling you where I'm at.

6090
03:39:13,270 --> 03:39:15,610
I need you to tell me where your why is.

6091
03:39:15,670 --> 03:39:16,830
I just need to know your why.

6092
03:39:16,950 --> 03:39:17,910
The why is different.

6093
03:39:18,090 --> 03:39:20,450
The why is what level you are at.

6094
03:39:21,330 --> 03:39:22,130
I'm at 90.

6095
03:39:23,830 --> 03:39:24,230
Alright.

6096
03:39:27,670 --> 03:39:29,030
Gosh, I thought I was about to fall.

6097
03:39:34,390 --> 03:39:36,890
What trap have you set up for me?

6098
03:39:37,050 --> 03:39:38,850
I have no trap!

6099
03:39:39,210 --> 03:39:43,930
I don't need to do any trap with what you are doing right now!

6100
03:39:44,010 --> 03:39:45,390
Someone came and snitched!

6101
03:39:45,490 --> 03:39:47,190
It's the Eragon guy again!

6102
03:39:47,850 --> 03:39:49,230
I have done nothing!

6103
03:39:49,510 --> 03:39:51,750
I'm merely just standing there!

6104
03:39:53,050 --> 03:39:55,010
I don't believe your lies.

6105
03:39:57,110 --> 03:40:00,170
I don't need to do any tricks!

6106
03:40:00,610 --> 03:40:01,910
Yes, you do!

6107
03:40:01,910 --> 03:40:03,030
No, I don't!

6108
03:40:03,170 --> 03:40:04,230
Do you want to know why?

6109
03:40:04,470 --> 03:40:11,010
I thought it would be funny if I placed more blocks above.

6110
03:40:11,610 --> 03:40:13,690
And then you told me you were at 30.

6111
03:40:13,970 --> 03:40:16,250
And do you know how high this mountain is?

6112
03:40:17,210 --> 03:40:18,750
It's a lot more than 30.

6113
03:40:18,950 --> 03:40:20,050
It's like 130.

6114
03:40:20,570 --> 03:40:22,650
And I didn't even say I was at 30.

6115
03:40:23,370 --> 03:40:24,310
Yes, you did.

6116
03:40:24,390 --> 03:40:27,330
And that's when I knew I didn't even have to do anything.

6117
03:40:28,890 --> 03:40:32,190
I'm gonna come out and you won't know where I am.

6118
03:40:32,190 --> 03:40:34,550
You're gonna be... Oh, I know where you are.

6119
03:40:34,790 --> 03:40:36,210
How do you know where I am?

6120
03:40:36,250 --> 03:40:37,330
I know where you are.

6121
03:40:37,830 --> 03:40:41,130
This entire mountain fucking covers a lot of blocks.

6122
03:40:41,750 --> 03:40:44,810
Yeah, but you don't know exactly where I'm gonna come out on the mountain.

6123
03:40:45,470 --> 03:40:46,550
Yes, I do.

6124
03:40:47,090 --> 03:40:48,350
Do you see my name?

6125
03:40:48,490 --> 03:40:49,090
I don't see you.

6126
03:40:50,590 --> 03:40:51,810
I don't even see your name.

6127
03:40:52,310 --> 03:40:55,290
Because you still have to dig!

6128
03:40:56,670 --> 03:40:57,530
I'm digging!

6129
03:40:57,530 --> 03:40:58,230
I'm digging!

6130
03:41:00,230 --> 03:41:03,490
You still have a long way to go.

6131
03:41:03,630 --> 03:41:05,050
Guys, how much do I have to go?

6132
03:41:05,450 --> 03:41:07,350
How much do I... What's the top?

6133
03:41:07,410 --> 03:41:08,010
Where are you at?

6134
03:41:09,330 --> 03:41:10,610
Where are you at?

6135
03:41:11,570 --> 03:41:13,990
You're the one who's just like...

6136
03:41:14,510 --> 03:41:16,670
I'm so tired of digging.

6137
03:41:17,190 --> 03:41:20,970
Please, why won't you just dig out?

6138
03:41:22,730 --> 03:41:24,230
Oh, and now look at you.

6139
03:41:25,070 --> 03:41:25,890
Look at you.

6140
03:41:25,890 --> 03:41:28,270
Oh, you're not even that high.

6141
03:41:28,390 --> 03:41:29,530
Oh my gosh.

6142
03:41:29,810 --> 03:41:31,310
You're so dramatic.

6143
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:31,990
Yeah?

6144
03:41:33,150 --> 03:41:35,170
140 is not that...

6145
03:41:35,170 --> 03:41:37,050
It's not even that high!

6146
03:41:37,590 --> 03:41:39,270
I'm at 66.

6147
03:41:39,450 --> 03:41:43,350
I have to climb up this mountain to get to where you are.

6148
03:41:45,470 --> 03:41:47,310
Okay, we have an actual problem.

6149
03:41:48,170 --> 03:41:49,330
What's the problem?

6150
03:41:50,210 --> 03:41:50,830
Sleep.

6151
03:41:52,650 --> 03:41:57,950
So, my pickaxe just broke and I don't have a crafting table.

6152
03:42:01,630 --> 03:42:02,910
Do you have a bed?

6153
03:42:04,470 --> 03:42:05,810
Yeah, I have a bed.

6154
03:42:06,070 --> 03:42:07,590
Okay, put that bed down.

6155
03:42:07,690 --> 03:42:08,910
We have to sleep anyway.

6156
03:42:09,150 --> 03:42:10,750
Oh, I can only sleep at night.

6157
03:42:11,890 --> 03:42:13,490
Yeah, the sun is setting.

6158
03:42:13,910 --> 03:42:15,450
It won't let me sleep.

6159
03:42:15,910 --> 03:42:17,070
Not yet, it's setting!

6160
03:42:22,730 --> 03:42:26,390
Oh, it's not that high, she says.

6161
03:42:26,490 --> 03:42:27,290
By the way, I'm sleeping.

6162
03:42:27,610 --> 03:42:28,350
I did too.

6163
03:42:29,490 --> 03:42:31,330
Yeah, so I guess I'm stuck here.

6164
03:42:31,750 --> 03:42:33,090
Oh my god, give me your coordinates.

6165
03:42:35,350 --> 03:42:36,950
Oh, we're stuck here?

6166
03:42:37,090 --> 03:42:37,830
That's fine.

6167
03:42:38,610 --> 03:42:39,250
Hold on.

6168
03:42:43,590 --> 03:42:45,210
Saving private mint.

6169
03:42:47,050 --> 03:42:48,330
Wait, hold on.

6170
03:42:49,930 --> 03:42:51,050
I'm pretty close.

6171
03:42:51,050 --> 03:42:53,330
I could punch my way to freedom.

6172
03:42:53,630 --> 03:42:55,390
Okay, do it.

6173
03:42:59,790 --> 03:43:01,270
There we go, guys.

6174
03:43:04,970 --> 03:43:07,430
Yeah, I don't have a crafting table.

6175
03:43:10,450 --> 03:43:13,870
Oh, I could've just put that in there.

6176
03:43:14,030 --> 03:43:14,450
Oh my gosh.

6177
03:43:14,650 --> 03:43:15,010
TNT?

6178
03:43:15,370 --> 03:43:17,010
Okay, I'm gonna do the TNT method.

6179
03:43:17,010 --> 03:43:18,010
No!

6180
03:43:20,030 --> 03:43:20,750
Uh-oh.

6181
03:43:21,210 --> 03:43:21,950
Spooky sound.

6182
03:43:23,030 --> 03:43:23,750
Oh, wait.

6183
03:43:24,250 --> 03:43:26,010
How do I... Oh, I have the flint.

6184
03:43:26,150 --> 03:43:28,170
I have the flint that will make it go explode.

6185
03:43:28,330 --> 03:43:29,030
I swear to god.

6186
03:43:29,250 --> 03:43:34,210
I swear to god, if you blow up and get knocked back into your fucking hole...

6187
03:43:34,210 --> 03:43:36,430
I might die, but probably not.

6188
03:43:36,750 --> 03:43:39,370
Alright, 07s, get ready, guys.

6189
03:43:39,970 --> 03:43:40,490
07s.

6190
03:43:42,250 --> 03:43:46,050
This might end up being her fucking gravestone at this rate.

6191
03:43:46,050 --> 03:43:48,690
How do I... Wait, it didn't make me go up.

6192
03:43:49,190 --> 03:43:49,910
Oh, this sucks.

6193
03:43:54,290 --> 03:43:56,450
Hold on, I have to punch it into the wall.

6194
03:43:56,670 --> 03:43:58,190
Do you need me to save you?

6195
03:43:58,230 --> 03:43:59,290
I have to punch into the wall.

6196
03:44:02,310 --> 03:44:04,390
Do you need me to dig down?

6197
03:44:06,610 --> 03:44:07,010
Yeah.

6198
03:44:07,970 --> 03:44:09,070
Alright, what are the coordinates?

6199
03:44:11,510 --> 03:44:12,310
Negative 3587.

6200
03:44:14,530 --> 03:44:17,030
And then 1693.

6201
03:44:20,770 --> 03:44:22,650
Why did you...

6202
03:44:22,650 --> 03:44:24,030
I'll wait here.

6203
03:44:26,470 --> 03:44:26,990
1693.

6204
03:44:29,130 --> 03:44:30,430
Yeah, I went a little further.

6205
03:44:30,630 --> 03:44:33,730
Okay, okay, and then negative 35...

6206
03:44:33,730 --> 03:44:34,750
Oh my god, okay.

6207
03:44:34,910 --> 03:44:36,410
It's just a couple blocks.

6208
03:44:37,050 --> 03:44:38,170
Okay, what's your Y?

6209
03:44:38,710 --> 03:44:39,330
I see you.

6210
03:44:39,390 --> 03:44:40,470
I literally see your name.

6211
03:44:40,470 --> 03:44:42,070
Oh my god.

6212
03:44:42,670 --> 03:44:43,850
What's your Y?

6213
03:44:44,270 --> 03:44:45,130
What's your Y?

6214
03:44:45,450 --> 03:44:47,510
Just look down, you'll see me.

6215
03:44:49,010 --> 03:44:50,790
I can hear you digging.

6216
03:44:51,130 --> 03:44:52,150
I can hear you digging.

6217
03:44:52,570 --> 03:44:55,530
You can literally punch this dirt.

6218
03:44:56,690 --> 03:44:58,910
It's stone where I am.

6219
03:44:59,130 --> 03:45:00,410
Oh my god.

6220
03:45:00,590 --> 03:45:02,750
It's literally stone here.

6221
03:45:07,340 --> 03:45:09,360
Oh shit, oh shit.

6222
03:45:11,120 --> 03:45:12,940
There you go, dig up, dig up once.

6223
03:45:13,200 --> 03:45:14,860
Wait, can you come get me?

6224
03:45:16,360 --> 03:45:17,260
Can you come get me?

6225
03:45:17,980 --> 03:45:19,800
I made a deep hole, dig up once.

6226
03:45:19,820 --> 03:45:21,340
No, I'm stuck here.

6227
03:45:21,620 --> 03:45:22,700
How are you stuck?

6228
03:45:22,740 --> 03:45:23,680
Just use your hands!

6229
03:45:23,920 --> 03:45:26,000
Use your hands and climb up.

6230
03:45:26,080 --> 03:45:26,780
I digged a hole.

6231
03:45:27,200 --> 03:45:28,000
I can't hold on.

6232
03:45:32,780 --> 03:45:35,780
I was gonna explode it so that I could get through.

6233
03:45:39,360 --> 03:45:41,040
Hold on, hold on.

6234
03:45:41,140 --> 03:45:41,700
I'm coming through.

6235
03:45:45,060 --> 03:45:46,680
Oh, I see you, hi!

6236
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:53,600
Dig up, dig up.

6237
03:45:53,820 --> 03:45:54,820
Hold on, I'm going up.

6238
03:45:56,120 --> 03:45:56,780
Oh wait, hold on.

6239
03:45:57,100 --> 03:45:58,360
I guess I'll leave him.

6240
03:45:58,880 --> 03:46:00,400
Where is it?

6241
03:46:00,900 --> 03:46:01,620
Is it night time?

6242
03:46:02,340 --> 03:46:02,620
No.

6243
03:46:02,920 --> 03:46:03,780
It's just dark.

6244
03:46:04,660 --> 03:46:05,600
I'm going, I'm going.

6245
03:46:05,600 --> 03:46:06,460
I'm going, oh my gosh.

6246
03:46:06,780 --> 03:46:08,300
This hole sucks.

6247
03:46:09,320 --> 03:46:10,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

6248
03:46:10,680 --> 03:46:12,220
Do you want me to make a better hole?

6249
03:46:15,480 --> 03:46:20,260
I'm sorry, but my rescue mission is not good enough for you.

6250
03:46:21,920 --> 03:46:25,120
Do you want to see how high this mountain is?

6251
03:46:25,380 --> 03:46:26,840
Look down here!

6252
03:46:31,570 --> 03:46:32,590
Hey, you know what?

6253
03:46:32,690 --> 03:46:34,190
It's good that we dug a lot.

6254
03:46:34,190 --> 03:46:41,030
What if we found the place that we have to put the enderpearls in?

6255
03:46:45,050 --> 03:46:47,250
Now we gotta get to the nether.

6256
03:46:48,010 --> 03:46:49,570
Yeah, now we gotta get to the nether.

6257
03:46:50,290 --> 03:46:51,430
I have lots of gold too.

6258
03:46:53,850 --> 03:46:54,290
Alright.

6259
03:46:54,990 --> 03:46:55,690
Oh wait, hold on.

6260
03:46:55,710 --> 03:46:56,710
I'm gonna burn my stuff.

6261
03:46:57,110 --> 03:46:57,870
I'm gonna cook my gold.

6262
03:46:57,910 --> 03:46:58,990
Do you have any obsidian?

6263
03:46:59,070 --> 03:46:59,850
I have three on me.

6264
03:47:00,470 --> 03:47:01,390
No, I don't have any.

6265
03:47:01,890 --> 03:47:02,230
Okay.

6266
03:47:03,510 --> 03:47:05,410
Actually, I really need to punch trees.

6267
03:47:05,490 --> 03:47:07,530
I'm gonna go punch this tree over here.

6268
03:47:07,930 --> 03:47:09,350
I'm gonna get my furnace too.

6269
03:47:09,570 --> 03:47:11,430
I'm gonna make some gold as well.

6270
03:47:11,490 --> 03:47:13,010
I'm gonna punch this tree over here.

6271
03:47:15,250 --> 03:47:17,390
The single tree on this mountain.

6272
03:47:17,990 --> 03:47:21,570
I feel like we should make like a mini house.

6273
03:47:22,410 --> 03:47:23,550
Like a little...

6274
03:47:23,550 --> 03:47:28,190
Yeah, when we find lava, we should make a mini house.

6275
03:47:29,030 --> 03:47:29,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6276
03:47:31,030 --> 03:47:32,850
I'm gonna make more than one furnace.

6277
03:47:33,030 --> 03:47:33,430
Fuck it.

6278
03:47:34,230 --> 03:47:34,910
Wait, no.

6279
03:47:35,770 --> 03:47:38,170
Why do I have cobbled pieces?

6280
03:47:41,730 --> 03:47:43,350
Oh wait, I'm so stupid.

6281
03:47:44,910 --> 03:47:46,470
Wait, what happened to my crafting table?

6282
03:47:46,690 --> 03:47:48,670
Oh, I fucking broke it.

6283
03:47:48,790 --> 03:47:49,530
Oh, I have another one.

6284
03:47:49,530 --> 03:47:50,110
I never picked it up.

6285
03:47:50,490 --> 03:47:51,490
I'm about to make one.

6286
03:47:52,170 --> 03:47:52,990
Yeah, I made another one.

6287
03:47:53,030 --> 03:47:54,510
I just wanted to make another furnace.

6288
03:47:55,250 --> 03:47:55,910
Oh, why?

6289
03:47:57,090 --> 03:48:00,530
Because I have a lot of stuff to burn.

6290
03:48:01,110 --> 03:48:02,110
Ah, me too.

6291
03:48:02,550 --> 03:48:04,450
I want to get rid of all of it now.

6292
03:48:08,110 --> 03:48:09,330
Alright, let's see.

6293
03:48:11,450 --> 03:48:14,250
I'm gonna throw away my iron stuff.

6294
03:48:14,970 --> 03:48:16,930
No, we need the iron stuff.

6295
03:48:16,990 --> 03:48:18,090
Yeah, you can throw away your stuff.

6296
03:48:18,350 --> 03:48:18,750
But we need the...

6297
03:48:18,750 --> 03:48:20,130
Yeah, I need my iron sword.

6298
03:48:20,750 --> 03:48:22,430
We need the actual iron though.

6299
03:48:24,110 --> 03:48:24,530
Why?

6300
03:48:24,530 --> 03:48:25,650
For shields.

6301
03:48:26,270 --> 03:48:27,230
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6302
03:48:27,230 --> 03:48:27,770
And water buckets.

6303
03:48:27,990 --> 03:48:28,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6304
03:48:29,150 --> 03:48:30,610
I'm planning on doing that.

6305
03:48:33,030 --> 03:48:34,910
Wow, the daylight.

6306
03:48:36,510 --> 03:48:37,510
Smells good, Aria.

6307
03:48:38,210 --> 03:48:38,650
Wow.

6308
03:48:39,090 --> 03:48:40,930
I forgot what that looked like for a sec.

6309
03:48:41,930 --> 03:48:43,890
Someone just said, set a spawn point.

6310
03:48:43,970 --> 03:48:44,510
That's so funny.

6311
03:48:44,990 --> 03:48:45,790
That's so funny.

6312
03:48:45,870 --> 03:48:47,510
I think they forgot what hardcore meant.

6313
03:48:47,510 --> 03:48:47,850
Yeah.

6314
03:48:53,550 --> 03:48:55,510
We're never coming back here.

6315
03:48:57,690 --> 03:48:59,190
I guess I can make this.

6316
03:49:01,010 --> 03:49:02,470
I think I can make this.

6317
03:49:02,470 --> 03:49:04,630
Well, I can make a lapis blocker, right, guys?

6318
03:49:05,130 --> 03:49:08,350
I would actually have enough for a lapis.

6319
03:49:08,350 --> 03:49:11,510
I have two stacks though, so it's not like...

6320
03:49:12,210 --> 03:49:12,830
Of lapis?

6321
03:49:12,890 --> 03:49:13,890
I have three stacks.

6322
03:49:14,010 --> 03:49:15,110
I have tons of lapis.

6323
03:49:15,130 --> 03:49:16,690
How much is a block?

6324
03:49:20,130 --> 03:49:20,850
Lapis block.

6325
03:49:20,990 --> 03:49:22,070
It still takes two.

6326
03:49:22,250 --> 03:49:24,550
Okay, I don't need these two lapis.

6327
03:49:24,710 --> 03:49:26,030
Here, give me the lapis.

6328
03:49:26,750 --> 03:49:28,090
Here, here, have the two.

6329
03:49:30,570 --> 03:49:32,190
Oh wait, I still don't have enough either.

6330
03:49:33,150 --> 03:49:35,250
Yeah, that's why I was thinking like, oh, it's no point.

6331
03:49:38,370 --> 03:49:39,130
Are you okay?

6332
03:49:39,770 --> 03:49:40,130
No.

6333
03:49:43,870 --> 03:49:45,470
What else is around here?

6334
03:49:45,470 --> 03:49:47,930
I'm not okay.

6335
03:49:48,330 --> 03:49:50,610
Did you find any villages while you were waiting?

6336
03:49:50,750 --> 03:49:52,870
No, I just waited on the mountain.

6337
03:49:54,070 --> 03:49:56,850
No, I didn't see any villages while I was waiting for you.

6338
03:49:56,910 --> 03:49:58,050
Oh, this isn't a house.

6339
03:49:58,150 --> 03:50:00,930
This is you trying to trap me in the mountain.

6340
03:50:02,690 --> 03:50:05,670
Yeah, and then I gave up because I realized how high up you were.

6341
03:50:08,450 --> 03:50:09,890
I was like, there's no point.

6342
03:50:10,050 --> 03:50:13,290
There's no point doing this.

6343
03:50:13,950 --> 03:50:15,890
There's a point to everything.

6344
03:50:16,510 --> 03:50:17,310
No, there's not.

6345
03:50:18,630 --> 03:50:19,030
Minecraft.

6346
03:50:19,530 --> 03:50:19,990
Oh my gosh.

6347
03:50:20,190 --> 03:50:21,390
I almost fell in lava.

6348
03:50:22,510 --> 03:50:23,790
Oh wait, we need that.

6349
03:50:23,910 --> 03:50:25,050
Okay, I'm gonna make a bucket then.

6350
03:50:25,510 --> 03:50:26,170
Oh yeah, yeah.

6351
03:50:26,570 --> 03:50:27,530
There's some lava here.

6352
03:50:29,790 --> 03:50:31,550
Wait, actually, no, we don't need...

6353
03:50:31,550 --> 03:50:34,830
Do we... I mean, we can do it in the ocean.

6354
03:50:36,470 --> 03:50:37,230
Do what in the ocean?

6355
03:50:37,230 --> 03:50:38,010
Actually, no.

6356
03:50:38,190 --> 03:50:40,050
Actually, I'll grab water.

6357
03:50:40,250 --> 03:50:40,970
Wouldn't it be easier to just get water?

6358
03:50:40,970 --> 03:50:45,210
Well, you have to... So you have to make it... It's like...

6359
03:50:45,210 --> 03:50:50,930
You have to make it a certain way so that it actually turns into obsidian and not into cobblestone.

6360
03:50:51,330 --> 03:50:53,890
Well, if it's like lava itself...

6361
03:50:53,890 --> 03:50:54,750
Wait, where are you?

6362
03:50:54,870 --> 03:50:55,790
Are you gonna make the lava?

6363
03:50:56,070 --> 03:50:57,350
We need a lava pool.

6364
03:50:58,330 --> 03:51:01,310
So like, I can get water and then...

6365
03:51:01,310 --> 03:51:02,870
But we still need lava regardless.

6366
03:51:03,910 --> 03:51:07,110
We need to make like... Yeah, no, we can use the lava pool to do it.

6367
03:51:08,370 --> 03:51:09,050
Here, I'll get this lava.

6368
03:51:09,050 --> 03:51:09,910
So I just need the water.

6369
03:51:09,910 --> 03:51:12,350
Yeah, but we need lava for protection in the nether.

6370
03:51:13,750 --> 03:51:14,230
What?

6371
03:51:14,890 --> 03:51:17,210
Why don't we just mine the obsidian?

6372
03:51:18,650 --> 03:51:19,090
What?

6373
03:51:19,230 --> 03:51:21,530
I mean, if we get the pool, then we can mine the obsidian.

6374
03:51:22,110 --> 03:51:23,910
No, it'd be easier to just...

6375
03:51:23,910 --> 03:51:24,370
Yeah.

6376
03:51:24,530 --> 03:51:28,150
Make it... We just pour water to get the bottom first.

6377
03:51:28,870 --> 03:51:31,910
And then mine and create the...

6378
03:51:33,810 --> 03:51:34,290
What?

6379
03:51:34,890 --> 03:51:37,050
Okay, let me grab water first.

6380
03:51:37,630 --> 03:51:40,590
And then I'll just pour water in it...

6381
03:51:40,590 --> 03:51:44,330
And then mine it and then we just build off the three blocks...

6382
03:51:44,330 --> 03:51:45,330
To make the thing.

6383
03:51:47,350 --> 03:51:49,370
Okay, you'll understand when I do it.

6384
03:51:52,510 --> 03:51:53,930
We need water first.

6385
03:51:55,650 --> 03:51:58,070
Yeah, that's kinda hard to get on top of a mountain.

6386
03:51:59,490 --> 03:52:01,750
Yeah, but the lava pool is... I can just climb back up.

6387
03:52:05,660 --> 03:52:06,220
What else do I need?

6388
03:52:06,520 --> 03:52:07,600
Oh, let me just get the...

6389
03:52:07,600 --> 03:52:09,460
I'll just burn the rabbit meat now.

6390
03:52:11,060 --> 03:52:13,140
You know that if... Okay, so...

6391
03:52:13,140 --> 03:52:16,520
You know how to make it stop being flowing lava?

6392
03:52:17,280 --> 03:52:20,040
Well, if it's... The lava block itself.

6393
03:52:20,160 --> 03:52:24,400
If the lava is like the main source, then it should be fine.

6394
03:52:25,040 --> 03:52:27,680
Why don't we just find a lava pool and then mine from it then?

6395
03:52:28,660 --> 03:52:29,680
Isn't that the lava pool?

6396
03:52:29,860 --> 03:52:31,420
Didn't you say there's a lava pool back there?

6397
03:52:31,500 --> 03:52:33,600
No, it was like a little tiny thing of lava.

6398
03:52:33,780 --> 03:52:34,140
That's it.

6399
03:52:34,140 --> 03:52:36,200
Oh, okay, nevermind.

6400
03:52:36,340 --> 03:52:37,880
Oh my gosh, you may have seen like...

6401
03:52:37,880 --> 03:52:38,120
No!

6402
03:52:38,680 --> 03:52:39,820
I didn't see anything!

6403
03:52:40,100 --> 03:52:40,720
See, I just said, oh!

6404
03:52:40,980 --> 03:52:44,320
Yo, this is miscommunication from somebody.

6405
03:52:45,060 --> 03:52:45,500
Somebody?

6406
03:52:45,720 --> 03:52:46,400
I wonder who.

6407
03:52:46,840 --> 03:52:47,820
Yeah, I wonder who.

6408
03:52:48,680 --> 03:52:49,280
I wonder who.

6409
03:52:49,280 --> 03:52:51,940
I wonder who's fucking gave me the wrong information.

6410
03:52:52,520 --> 03:52:52,880
I don't know, buddy.

6411
03:52:54,760 --> 03:52:55,960
Who could it be?

6412
03:52:58,500 --> 03:53:01,500
I mean, we could go back into the mines and then we'd...

6413
03:53:01,500 --> 03:53:02,280
No, we're not going... No.

6414
03:53:04,140 --> 03:53:06,280
We're not going back into the mines.

6415
03:53:06,360 --> 03:53:07,080
Oh, let's sleep.

6416
03:53:07,540 --> 03:53:08,320
Oh, that's my bed!

6417
03:53:08,400 --> 03:53:08,840
That's my bed!

6418
03:53:08,860 --> 03:53:09,420
That's my bed!

6419
03:53:09,420 --> 03:53:10,100
No, it's not!

6420
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:12,000
I don't have a bed now!

6421
03:53:12,540 --> 03:53:13,760
Get out of my bed!

6422
03:53:17,240 --> 03:53:18,140
There we go.

6423
03:53:18,160 --> 03:53:18,820
Oh my God.

6424
03:53:20,360 --> 03:53:21,940
Why do you have a blue bed?

6425
03:53:22,300 --> 03:53:23,900
Because I wanted a blue bed.

6426
03:53:26,560 --> 03:53:28,960
Well, I called dibs on this color for...

6427
03:53:28,960 --> 03:53:31,700
I saw you take it.

6428
03:53:32,120 --> 03:53:36,540
I literally saw you take it.

6429
03:53:36,540 --> 03:53:39,300
I literally saw you take it.

6430
03:53:42,060 --> 03:53:43,860
This is why we can't have nice things.

6431
03:53:43,860 --> 03:53:45,120
This is why we can't have nice things.

6432
03:53:45,420 --> 03:53:47,960
This is exactly why we can't have nice things.

6433
03:53:47,980 --> 03:53:49,640
Okay, we're gonna go find...

6434
03:53:50,320 --> 03:53:52,120
We're gonna go find a lava pit.

6435
03:53:53,780 --> 03:53:55,440
There's tons of them in this forest.

6436
03:53:55,540 --> 03:53:56,260
In these types of forests.

6437
03:53:56,380 --> 03:53:57,000
There should be.

6438
03:53:57,140 --> 03:53:57,440
Yeah.

6439
03:53:57,440 --> 03:53:57,960
Alright.

6440
03:53:59,120 --> 03:53:59,740
Oh, look!

6441
03:54:00,100 --> 03:54:01,360
That looks like lava down there.

6442
03:54:02,180 --> 03:54:02,660
Where?

6443
03:54:02,980 --> 03:54:04,440
In that big, big cave.

6444
03:54:05,480 --> 03:54:08,920
I'm not gonna go to the cave to make the fucking nether stuff.

6445
03:54:10,020 --> 03:54:10,480
Why not?

6446
03:54:11,540 --> 03:54:13,420
My God, do you wanna die?

6447
03:54:13,900 --> 03:54:17,160
What do you mean, why not?

6448
03:54:18,580 --> 03:54:19,820
Oh, don't go that way.

6449
03:54:20,020 --> 03:54:21,120
That's how you die!

6450
03:54:24,940 --> 03:54:25,640
Hold on.

6451
03:54:25,700 --> 03:54:27,020
Oh my God, you're...

6452
03:54:27,020 --> 03:54:28,000
Just fall down.

6453
03:54:28,000 --> 03:54:29,920
We literally have diamond armor.

6454
03:54:30,120 --> 03:54:31,880
I don't wanna take any damage.

6455
03:54:32,040 --> 03:54:33,540
I don't wanna damage my armor at all.

6456
03:54:34,580 --> 03:54:35,220
Just fall down.

6457
03:54:35,340 --> 03:54:35,800
We have...

6458
03:54:35,800 --> 03:54:36,780
We can repair it.

6459
03:54:36,860 --> 03:54:39,340
We have so much diamonds to repair it.

6460
03:54:39,980 --> 03:54:41,940
No, I'm not wasting my diamonds to repair it.

6461
03:54:41,980 --> 03:54:43,700
We gotta get mending, maybe.

6462
03:54:44,420 --> 03:54:46,540
We're not gonna have time to get mending!

6463
03:54:46,940 --> 03:54:47,200
Why not?

6464
03:54:48,300 --> 03:54:50,800
Oh my God, we're gonna have to find books!

6465
03:54:51,420 --> 03:54:52,600
Yeah, that's the point.

6466
03:54:52,680 --> 03:54:53,140
We gotta...

6467
03:54:53,140 --> 03:54:54,840
That's the point of the lapis!

6468
03:54:56,160 --> 03:54:57,500
Okay, alright.

6469
03:54:58,200 --> 03:55:01,180
We gotta get at least, like, the projectile stuff.

6470
03:55:02,260 --> 03:55:03,840
And we gotta also get...

6471
03:55:04,620 --> 03:55:05,840
Slow falling potions...

6472
03:55:06,560 --> 03:55:07,660
And we gotta get here.

6473
03:55:07,740 --> 03:55:08,940
Oh, I left my bow.

6474
03:55:09,260 --> 03:55:09,920
Aw, man.

6475
03:55:10,460 --> 03:55:12,180
Oh my God, there's trees everywhere.

6476
03:55:12,880 --> 03:55:14,420
There's trees everywhere.

6477
03:55:14,780 --> 03:55:16,320
There weren't trees in the caves!

6478
03:55:17,780 --> 03:55:19,860
There's trees everywhere right now.

6479
03:55:19,980 --> 03:55:21,360
I'm literally farming trees now.

6480
03:55:21,360 --> 03:55:23,060
I'm still in the caves, mentally.

6481
03:55:24,840 --> 03:55:26,180
No, the cave madness.

6482
03:55:26,600 --> 03:55:27,960
She's just standing there.

6483
03:55:28,020 --> 03:55:30,160
Why is she just standing there?

6484
03:55:30,540 --> 03:55:32,000
I'm mentally in the caves.

6485
03:55:32,120 --> 03:55:34,140
I was switching my items, my God!

6486
03:55:35,720 --> 03:55:37,320
Oh, there's pillagers here.

6487
03:55:37,560 --> 03:55:37,860
What?

6488
03:55:38,400 --> 03:55:38,780
Where?

6489
03:55:39,420 --> 03:55:40,620
Right behind me.

6490
03:55:40,900 --> 03:55:41,620
Where are you?

6491
03:55:42,400 --> 03:55:43,340
Wait, where did you go?

6492
03:55:43,460 --> 03:55:44,560
I'm literally...

6493
03:55:44,560 --> 03:55:45,260
Where are you?

6494
03:55:45,940 --> 03:55:46,660
Wait, where are you?

6495
03:55:46,720 --> 03:55:46,940
See?

6496
03:55:47,080 --> 03:55:48,740
This is why we can't make a good team!

6497
03:55:48,840 --> 03:55:49,400
There you go.

6498
03:55:49,500 --> 03:55:49,820
There you go.

6499
03:55:50,180 --> 03:55:50,960
Okay, here we go.

6500
03:55:51,100 --> 03:55:52,400
Watch out, he's right behind you.

6501
03:55:52,400 --> 03:55:54,820
Just come at me here.

6502
03:55:54,980 --> 03:55:55,840
Just run!

6503
03:55:55,980 --> 03:55:56,740
It doesn't matter!

6504
03:55:57,540 --> 03:55:58,620
It doesn't matter!

6505
03:55:59,680 --> 03:56:00,540
Don't kill him!

6506
03:56:00,680 --> 03:56:01,200
Don't kill him!

6507
03:56:01,260 --> 03:56:02,060
Run, run, run, run!

6508
03:56:02,140 --> 03:56:02,520
Run away!

6509
03:56:02,600 --> 03:56:03,180
Don't kill him!

6510
03:56:03,340 --> 03:56:05,480
I know, he'll start the raid.

6511
03:56:05,700 --> 03:56:08,300
Yeah, we have to not have a raid happen.

6512
03:56:08,520 --> 03:56:09,160
Okay, wait.

6513
03:56:09,260 --> 03:56:09,760
Give me a second.

6514
03:56:09,940 --> 03:56:11,960
I need to put my shield on.

6515
03:56:13,980 --> 03:56:15,240
Oh my God, he's coming for me.

6516
03:56:15,680 --> 03:56:17,160
Oh my God, they're coming for me!

6517
03:56:18,600 --> 03:56:20,400
Wait, where did my...

6518
03:56:20,400 --> 03:56:22,760
Where did my diamond sword go?

6519
03:56:23,680 --> 03:56:25,480
Where did your diamond sword...

6520
03:56:25,480 --> 03:56:26,520
Did you not make one?

6521
03:56:27,560 --> 03:56:28,560
No, I did.

6522
03:56:28,700 --> 03:56:29,920
Oh my God, they're still coming for me.

6523
03:56:33,120 --> 03:56:33,560
Wait...

6524
03:56:34,140 --> 03:56:35,620
Did I throw it away?

6525
03:56:35,860 --> 03:56:36,860
Did you throw it away?

6526
03:56:38,020 --> 03:56:38,260
Okay.

6527
03:56:38,520 --> 03:56:39,220
I think I...

6528
03:56:39,220 --> 03:56:41,800
Oh, I never made one because I made my pickaxe.

6529
03:56:41,920 --> 03:56:43,300
I'm just gonna kill him.

6530
03:56:43,600 --> 03:56:44,240
I'll drink milk!

6531
03:56:44,700 --> 03:56:45,560
I'll drink milk.

6532
03:56:46,700 --> 03:56:47,920
He dropped something.

6533
03:56:48,020 --> 03:56:49,360
Wait, what was the potion he dropped?

6534
03:56:51,780 --> 03:56:53,780
Bad Omen 3, you can drink that.

6535
03:56:54,840 --> 03:56:56,080
Bad Omen 3?

6536
03:56:56,340 --> 03:56:57,740
You have more experience with that.

6537
03:56:59,000 --> 03:57:00,440
Wait, you have a bad omen now?

6538
03:57:01,000 --> 03:57:02,260
No, I gave it to you.

6539
03:57:03,260 --> 03:57:04,360
Wait, you drink it?

6540
03:57:04,440 --> 03:57:05,980
Oh, it's not like automatic now?

6541
03:57:06,080 --> 03:57:06,440
Interesting.

6542
03:57:08,100 --> 03:57:09,760
You don't get bad omen from killing anymore.

6543
03:57:10,020 --> 03:57:10,200
What?

6544
03:57:11,040 --> 03:57:11,960
That's crazy.

6545
03:57:12,560 --> 03:57:14,260
Yeah, you dropped it as a potion.

6546
03:57:14,920 --> 03:57:16,480
You're the one that killed it.

6547
03:57:16,480 --> 03:57:17,540
No, I saw that.

6548
03:57:17,640 --> 03:57:18,840
No, but you picked up the potion.

6549
03:57:18,940 --> 03:57:20,300
That's why I asked you what did he drop.

6550
03:57:22,300 --> 03:57:23,400
What the heck?

6551
03:57:23,760 --> 03:57:24,620
Oh, interesting.

6552
03:57:26,320 --> 03:57:27,560
Wait, what was your plan again?

6553
03:57:27,700 --> 03:57:28,960
Oh yeah, to find lava pool.

6554
03:57:29,420 --> 03:57:29,740
Yeah.

6555
03:57:30,700 --> 03:57:32,100
Where's your fucking cocoa beans?

6556
03:57:34,200 --> 03:57:35,220
I'm gonna go this way.

6557
03:57:35,360 --> 03:57:36,120
I feel like...

6558
03:57:36,120 --> 03:57:37,720
Wait, we should... Where are you?

6559
03:57:38,280 --> 03:57:39,120
I'm in the water.

6560
03:57:39,280 --> 03:57:40,100
Wait, where did you go?

6561
03:57:40,260 --> 03:57:41,040
Did you go in the jungle?

6562
03:57:41,200 --> 03:57:41,980
Did you go in the jungle?

6563
03:57:41,980 --> 03:57:43,120
I'm not in the jungle!

6564
03:57:43,120 --> 03:57:44,880
Oh, there I see you.

6565
03:57:44,940 --> 03:57:46,060
I was gonna go that way too.

6566
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:48,100
That's why I was like, wait a second.

6567
03:57:49,300 --> 03:57:52,040
Apparently, it's for use in the tricky trial dungeon.

6568
03:57:52,360 --> 03:57:53,560
Whatever that means.

6569
03:57:53,980 --> 03:57:55,480
That's the trial dungeon, right?

6570
03:57:55,580 --> 03:57:56,540
The thing I talked about before?

6571
03:57:57,920 --> 03:57:58,940
Oh, it's that?

6572
03:57:59,080 --> 03:57:59,760
Wait, what is that?

6573
03:57:59,760 --> 03:58:00,880
You have to make the sword.

6574
03:58:02,640 --> 03:58:04,780
Well, how do we use it in that?

6575
03:58:06,480 --> 03:58:07,700
Yeah, what does that even mean?

6576
03:58:07,800 --> 03:58:10,260
Oh my god, rip everybody's farms.

6577
03:58:10,260 --> 03:58:12,420
I see a village!

6578
03:58:13,460 --> 03:58:15,660
We don't need a village anymore, right?

6579
03:58:15,840 --> 03:58:17,000
Oh wait, nevermind, it's not a village.

6580
03:58:17,100 --> 03:58:17,900
It's a nether portal!

6581
03:58:18,220 --> 03:58:19,140
Oh, we can use that!

6582
03:58:19,140 --> 03:58:20,180
We can use that to make it!

6583
03:58:20,280 --> 03:58:21,760
Use that to make the thing.

6584
03:58:22,420 --> 03:58:24,180
Just take away the corrupted areas.

6585
03:58:24,300 --> 03:58:24,920
Yeah, yeah.

6586
03:58:25,740 --> 03:58:26,820
And you have your flint, right?

6587
03:58:27,400 --> 03:58:27,740
Yeah.

6588
03:58:29,260 --> 03:58:30,560
Okay, alright, we can do this.

6589
03:58:31,120 --> 03:58:33,020
Oh wow, it's almost nearly complete too.

6590
03:58:33,620 --> 03:58:34,280
Okay, we can do this.

6591
03:58:34,340 --> 03:58:36,620
Get the corrupted... Oh wait, we just need one!

6592
03:58:36,620 --> 03:58:37,140
We just need one!

6593
03:58:37,320 --> 03:58:38,040
Wait, I...

6594
03:58:38,040 --> 03:58:39,200
Wait, I have one, I have one, I have one.

6595
03:58:41,160 --> 03:58:41,700
There you go.

6596
03:58:41,740 --> 03:58:42,200
Oh my god.

6597
03:58:42,400 --> 03:58:44,120
I don't think there's any corrupted areas too.

6598
03:58:44,820 --> 03:58:46,000
Wait, I think it's not corrupted!

6599
03:58:46,840 --> 03:58:47,760
Yeah, I think we're good.

6600
03:58:47,920 --> 03:58:49,120
Okay, lighting up.

6601
03:58:52,380 --> 03:58:54,960
Okay, let's put... I'm gonna make another chest.

6602
03:58:55,800 --> 03:58:58,720
I feel like, just put away stuff we don't wanna take to the nether.

6603
03:58:59,160 --> 03:59:00,560
Uh, I don't know.

6604
03:59:01,740 --> 03:59:05,900
I'm gonna put a crafting table here, chest.

6605
03:59:07,260 --> 03:59:09,000
I'm gonna make another chest for us.

6606
03:59:09,040 --> 03:59:09,880
Get rid of this.

6607
03:59:11,120 --> 03:59:14,740
Um, I don't think... Okay, I'm gonna make some...

6608
03:59:14,740 --> 03:59:15,920
Make a gold helmet?

6609
03:59:16,820 --> 03:59:19,720
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm gonna make, but I wanna make some...

6610
03:59:21,280 --> 03:59:22,540
I'm gonna make some bread.

6611
03:59:22,540 --> 03:59:23,540
And then...

6612
03:59:27,480 --> 03:59:28,440
There we go.

6613
03:59:31,800 --> 03:59:32,520
And then...

6614
03:59:32,520 --> 03:59:33,860
I still have a name tag.

6615
03:59:34,420 --> 03:59:35,260
I wanna name something.

6616
03:59:35,580 --> 03:59:37,240
You can just put it in the chest.

6617
03:59:37,400 --> 03:59:37,640
Okay.

6618
03:59:38,900 --> 03:59:40,640
I'll put the stuff I don't need in the chest.

6619
03:59:40,760 --> 03:59:41,860
We don't need all that coal.

6620
03:59:42,560 --> 03:59:43,920
We don't need all this flint.

6621
03:59:44,160 --> 03:59:45,520
We don't need the lapis.

6622
03:59:46,460 --> 03:59:49,020
I don't trust you with my diamonds, so I'm gonna put it in my inventory.

6623
03:59:50,560 --> 03:59:50,880
Hey!

6624
03:59:51,860 --> 03:59:52,800
I mean, what?

6625
03:59:53,160 --> 03:59:54,700
What's gonna happen if we die?

6626
03:59:56,220 --> 03:59:57,580
We're not... Don't say that.

6627
03:59:57,800 --> 03:59:58,660
That's what I'm saying, though.

6628
03:59:58,720 --> 04:00:00,660
You were like, oh, I'm just gonna put my diamond in my chest.

6629
04:00:00,780 --> 04:00:01,060
Why?

6630
04:00:01,200 --> 04:00:02,480
Because if we die, we die.

6631
04:00:02,660 --> 04:00:06,820
Because if we come back and then my diamond is gone, then I know why.

6632
04:00:07,020 --> 04:00:10,000
No, but the only reason you put your diamond away is if you die.

6633
04:00:11,260 --> 04:00:14,660
No, the only reason I put my diamond away is because I don't want you to fucking take it from this random chest.

6634
04:00:14,680 --> 04:00:16,020
Oh my god, you're dying...

6635
04:00:16,020 --> 04:00:18,480
Doki comprehension is not comprehending.

6636
04:00:18,820 --> 04:00:19,840
Oh my god.

6637
04:00:21,020 --> 04:00:24,700
Alright, are you ready to go into the nether?

6638
04:00:26,580 --> 04:00:27,520
Yeah, I'm ready.

6639
04:00:28,400 --> 04:00:29,460
Get a pickaxe?

6640
04:00:29,520 --> 04:00:30,060
Wait, why?

6641
04:00:30,280 --> 04:00:31,900
Hi, we didn't have a pickaxe.

6642
04:00:31,980 --> 04:00:33,040
I don't have one, actually.

6643
04:00:33,640 --> 04:00:34,880
What happened to your...

6644
04:00:36,560 --> 04:00:37,480
Mine died, remember?

6645
04:00:37,480 --> 04:00:38,260
Oh yeah, because you broke it.

6646
04:00:38,860 --> 04:00:40,260
Hey, I was using that!

6647
04:00:40,260 --> 04:00:41,060
Oh.

6648
04:00:44,380 --> 04:00:44,900
Whoops.

6649
04:00:45,840 --> 04:00:46,200
Okay.

6650
04:00:46,980 --> 04:00:50,540
Alright, so from here, now we have to...

6651
04:00:50,540 --> 04:00:52,260
We find...

6652
04:00:52,820 --> 04:00:53,640
We survive.

6653
04:00:54,240 --> 04:00:55,960
We have to get blazer arms.

6654
04:00:56,620 --> 04:00:57,140
Oh gosh.

6655
04:00:57,340 --> 04:00:59,380
Yeah, we gotta survive and...

6656
04:00:59,380 --> 04:01:00,540
Alright, I have some...

6657
04:01:00,540 --> 04:01:03,280
Wait, we gotta feed pigs too for enderpearls.

6658
04:01:03,420 --> 04:01:03,700
Yeah.

6659
04:01:03,820 --> 04:01:05,020
How many enderpearls do we need?

6660
04:01:07,520 --> 04:01:08,860
Um, we can...

6661
04:01:10,660 --> 04:01:13,840
It really depends on how many you need.

6662
04:01:14,280 --> 04:01:17,440
Chat, how many enderpearls do we need?

6663
04:01:17,440 --> 04:01:21,520
We need 12, but how many is it 14 safe?

6664
04:01:24,480 --> 04:01:25,360
14, okay.

6665
04:01:25,520 --> 04:01:26,240
At least 12.

6666
04:01:26,360 --> 04:01:27,000
Take a diamond one?

6667
04:01:27,120 --> 04:01:27,320
Okay.

6668
04:01:28,080 --> 04:01:28,960
Diamond pickaxe.

6669
04:01:29,140 --> 04:01:29,880
Oh, wait, hold on.

6670
04:01:33,160 --> 04:01:34,180
Stop pushing me!

6671
04:01:34,580 --> 04:01:35,300
I didn't know that.

6672
04:01:35,500 --> 04:01:37,180
I literally can see you pushing me.

6673
04:01:37,900 --> 04:01:38,340
Stop...

6674
04:01:41,200 --> 04:01:42,380
Alright, are you ready?

6675
04:01:43,460 --> 04:01:43,840
Yeah.

6676
04:01:44,120 --> 04:01:44,720
Here I go.

6677
04:01:44,840 --> 04:01:45,520
I'm going in.

6678
04:01:45,600 --> 04:01:46,360
I'm going in.

6679
04:01:46,840 --> 04:01:49,220
Alright, I'm going in too.

6680
04:01:50,540 --> 04:01:51,560
Please don't be a jungle.

6681
04:01:51,720 --> 04:01:52,440
Please don't be a jungle.

6682
04:01:52,540 --> 04:01:53,160
Please don't be a jungle.

6683
04:01:53,300 --> 04:01:53,920
Please don't be a jungle.

6684
04:01:54,020 --> 04:01:54,580
Please don't be a jungle.

6685
04:01:57,780 --> 04:01:59,180
Okay, could be worse.

6686
04:01:59,960 --> 04:02:00,760
It's not that bad.

6687
04:02:00,920 --> 04:02:01,820
This could be worse.

6688
04:02:02,240 --> 04:02:03,100
It's not that bad.

6689
04:02:03,100 --> 04:02:04,580
I see chicken.

6690
04:02:05,180 --> 04:02:07,160
How did you get a chicken in here?

6691
04:02:07,440 --> 04:02:09,220
How did a chicken get in here?

6692
04:02:10,260 --> 04:02:11,960
Are you taking the court?

6693
04:02:12,440 --> 04:02:13,660
Yeah, I want the experience.

6694
04:02:13,940 --> 04:02:14,460
True.

6695
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:15,800
Okay, be careful.

6696
04:02:16,380 --> 04:02:16,960
Oh my god.

6697
04:02:17,740 --> 04:02:19,540
How did he get the chicken in here?

6698
04:02:19,620 --> 04:02:21,160
I know, I'm like thinking...

6699
04:02:21,160 --> 04:02:22,740
Wait, there's blue fires now?

6700
04:02:23,700 --> 04:02:24,220
Yeah.

6701
04:02:25,800 --> 04:02:27,400
What does blue fire mean?

6702
04:02:27,640 --> 04:02:29,040
That's like a different biome.

6703
04:02:30,700 --> 04:02:32,440
That's the soul fire.

6704
04:02:32,800 --> 04:02:33,720
On the soul sand.

6705
04:02:35,000 --> 04:02:35,520
Okay.

6706
04:02:36,160 --> 04:02:38,160
There's no hoglins around here.

6707
04:02:38,660 --> 04:02:40,940
But we maybe should...

6708
04:02:40,940 --> 04:02:42,400
I don't know what to do first.

6709
04:02:42,640 --> 04:02:43,840
I'm just gonna go this way.

6710
04:02:44,140 --> 04:02:44,900
Where did you go?

6711
04:02:45,620 --> 04:02:46,020
Up?

6712
04:02:46,620 --> 04:02:46,860
Up!

6713
04:02:48,060 --> 04:02:49,060
Oh, you're going up that way?

6714
04:02:49,120 --> 04:02:49,280
Okay.

6715
04:02:49,960 --> 04:02:51,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6716
04:02:51,840 --> 04:02:52,240
Okay.

6717
04:02:52,240 --> 04:02:53,880
I don't know, I just feel safer going up.

6718
04:02:53,960 --> 04:02:55,160
Wait, that's the chicken.

6719
04:02:55,340 --> 04:02:55,800
Where are you?

6720
04:02:55,880 --> 04:02:56,520
Oh, no, I see you.

6721
04:02:57,020 --> 04:02:57,680
Yeah, I'm here.

6722
04:02:58,320 --> 04:02:59,960
I guess chickens were originally in hell.

6723
04:03:00,820 --> 04:03:01,720
Sounds about right.

6724
04:03:02,280 --> 04:03:02,680
Yeah.

6725
04:03:03,060 --> 04:03:04,020
Birds are from hell.

6726
04:03:05,260 --> 04:03:05,660
Yeah.

6727
04:03:06,220 --> 04:03:07,340
That's a fellow bird.

6728
04:03:07,460 --> 04:03:07,900
I agree.

6729
04:03:08,280 --> 04:03:08,540
I know.

6730
04:03:10,660 --> 04:03:13,620
Alright, I got the nug... Oh, there's a strider down there.

6731
04:03:14,680 --> 04:03:15,720
We don't need him.

6732
04:03:16,200 --> 04:03:16,940
We don't need him.

6733
04:03:17,560 --> 04:03:19,040
He can live here for all I care.

6734
04:03:19,120 --> 04:03:19,340
Yeah.

6735
04:03:19,760 --> 04:03:21,160
I'm sure he wants to, otherwise.

6736
04:03:21,640 --> 04:03:22,620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6737
04:03:22,660 --> 04:03:24,420
Like, when you take him out...

6738
04:03:24,420 --> 04:03:24,860
Oh, there he is!

6739
04:03:25,160 --> 04:03:26,540
There's a pig, pig!

6740
04:03:27,080 --> 04:03:27,920
It's time to feed you.

6741
04:03:27,920 --> 04:03:29,440
Okay, take...

6742
04:03:29,840 --> 04:03:30,740
Take the gold!

6743
04:03:30,760 --> 04:03:31,400
Take the gold!

6744
04:03:31,600 --> 04:03:33,320
Let him observe, let him observe.

6745
04:03:33,880 --> 04:03:34,280
Observe?

6746
04:03:34,480 --> 04:03:34,880
Observe?

6747
04:03:34,880 --> 04:03:36,680
Oh, no, the guy's over there.

6748
04:03:37,160 --> 04:03:38,180
Oh, oh, oh, what did I get?

6749
04:03:38,300 --> 04:03:38,880
I got obsidian.

6750
04:03:39,040 --> 04:03:39,920
I got three obsidian.

6751
04:03:40,080 --> 04:03:40,520
That's cool.

6752
04:03:40,720 --> 04:03:42,180
It's not like we don't need that anymore.

6753
04:03:42,360 --> 04:03:43,700
Oh, he's taking it, he's taking it, he's taking it.

6754
04:03:44,340 --> 04:03:45,440
There's another guy up there.

6755
04:03:45,480 --> 04:03:46,600
I'll go to him with mine.

6756
04:03:46,600 --> 04:03:47,420
Yeah, you go to him.

6757
04:03:47,500 --> 04:03:48,320
I'll feed this guy.

6758
04:03:48,460 --> 04:03:48,680
Yeah.

6759
04:03:48,880 --> 04:03:49,440
Oh, my gosh.

6760
04:03:49,560 --> 04:03:52,420
He gave me... What the fuck did he... He gave me gravel?

6761
04:03:52,920 --> 04:03:55,080
I gave you gold, sir!

6762
04:03:57,060 --> 04:03:58,780
And you gave me gravel?

6763
04:04:01,140 --> 04:04:01,580
I'm scared.

6764
04:04:01,580 --> 04:04:03,620
He gave me fire... Oh, my God, he's useless.

6765
04:04:05,100 --> 04:04:06,320
Oh, my God, I hear a ghast.

6766
04:04:06,680 --> 04:04:08,300
No, no, no, Doki, I hear a ghast!

6767
04:04:08,500 --> 04:04:10,680
Oh, he's right near me, he's next to me, he's next to me, he's next to me.

6768
04:04:10,720 --> 04:04:12,680
I try to ping, I try to ping.

6769
04:04:17,760 --> 04:04:19,460
I press middle mouse button.

6770
04:04:19,980 --> 04:04:21,360
Oh, he's looking at me.

6771
04:04:21,680 --> 04:04:23,400
Oh, God, what do we do?

6772
04:04:26,380 --> 04:04:29,680
Oh, he's right by this... by our... by our...

6773
04:04:31,060 --> 04:04:31,880
portal, even.

6774
04:04:31,960 --> 04:04:32,760
What an asshole.

6775
04:04:32,760 --> 04:04:34,060
What the hell did he give me?

6776
04:04:34,660 --> 04:04:35,740
He gave me leather?

6777
04:04:37,200 --> 04:04:38,160
Your guy sucks.

6778
04:04:38,900 --> 04:04:40,020
I'm gonna go talk to this...

6779
04:04:40,020 --> 04:04:41,140
Oh, did he give you anything good?

6780
04:04:41,240 --> 04:04:44,800
I haven't talked to him yet because of the... the ghast.

6781
04:04:44,880 --> 04:04:45,720
Okay, come here.

6782
04:04:46,380 --> 04:04:47,060
Hey, come here.

6783
04:04:47,420 --> 04:04:48,340
Oh, my God, ghast.

6784
04:04:48,400 --> 04:04:50,300
He keeps giving me blackstone.

6785
04:04:52,140 --> 04:04:53,060
What are you gonna give me?

6786
04:04:53,060 --> 04:04:55,440
I keep getting gravel and blackstone.

6787
04:04:55,820 --> 04:04:57,560
Oh, he gave me boots.

6788
04:04:58,160 --> 04:04:58,940
Enchanted boots.

6789
04:05:00,120 --> 04:05:01,240
I don't... Oh, whoops.

6790
04:05:01,540 --> 04:05:01,940
Please!

6791
04:05:02,620 --> 04:05:03,520
I don't need this.

6792
04:05:03,660 --> 04:05:03,960
I need this.

6793
04:05:05,680 --> 04:05:06,580
Oh, what the hell?

6794
04:05:07,660 --> 04:05:10,600
He just took my... the boots and put them on.

6795
04:05:12,160 --> 04:05:13,580
He stole your...

6796
04:05:13,580 --> 04:05:14,620
He stole the boots.

6797
04:05:14,880 --> 04:05:17,340
Oh, I got nether... Oh, you don't need nether bricks either.

6798
04:05:17,500 --> 04:05:18,540
Hey, hey, hey, come here, come here.

6799
04:05:19,980 --> 04:05:20,920
Yeah, yeah, take that.

6800
04:05:21,220 --> 04:05:24,980
I got fucking... Oh, my God, give me something good.

6801
04:05:25,060 --> 04:05:26,840
I don't need blackstone.

6802
04:05:26,840 --> 04:05:28,480
How is this big?

6803
04:05:29,260 --> 04:05:30,120
Spectral arrows!

6804
04:05:32,180 --> 04:05:33,400
I got that too.

6805
04:05:33,900 --> 04:05:34,440
That should be...

6806
04:05:34,440 --> 04:05:36,220
This is the worst gacha I ever had.

6807
04:05:37,420 --> 04:05:38,520
Oh, I got iron boots.

6808
04:05:38,760 --> 04:05:40,440
He gave me fucking iron boots.

6809
04:05:40,460 --> 04:05:41,580
Soul speed, okay.

6810
04:05:42,160 --> 04:05:43,660
I'm just gonna give him the whole thing.

6811
04:05:43,720 --> 04:05:44,080
Here you go.

6812
04:05:44,500 --> 04:05:44,940
Here, take it, take it, take it.

6813
04:05:44,940 --> 04:05:46,920
I'm losing the gacha right now.

6814
04:05:47,060 --> 04:05:49,040
I'm not doing well with this gacha.

6815
04:05:49,720 --> 04:05:50,980
I'm not...

6816
04:05:52,060 --> 04:05:53,440
I'm ditching this one.

6817
04:05:53,560 --> 04:05:54,280
I'll give it...

6818
04:05:54,280 --> 04:05:55,480
Do you have better gacha?

6819
04:05:56,360 --> 04:05:57,560
What did he just give me?

6820
04:05:58,220 --> 04:05:59,100
I can't tell.

6821
04:05:59,180 --> 04:06:00,260
My inventory is full.

6822
04:06:01,540 --> 04:06:02,480
Oh, golden axe.

6823
04:06:02,640 --> 04:06:03,160
Do you have better gacha?

6824
04:06:03,480 --> 04:06:05,680
You gave me string?!

6825
04:06:06,360 --> 04:06:07,660
Here's my last gold.

6826
04:06:08,560 --> 04:06:09,540
What is he looking at?

6827
04:06:09,840 --> 04:06:11,360
Oh, I gave him a gold!

6828
04:06:11,620 --> 04:06:12,360
Oh, my gosh.

6829
04:06:13,800 --> 04:06:14,940
Did he just drop it?

6830
04:06:15,000 --> 04:06:15,480
What did he do?

6831
04:06:15,980 --> 04:06:16,860
What did he give me?

6832
04:06:17,020 --> 04:06:17,580
I gave him...

6833
04:06:18,040 --> 04:06:20,360
He gave me another stack of string.

6834
04:06:20,620 --> 04:06:21,580
He's giving me corpse.

6835
04:06:22,680 --> 04:06:24,800
This is kind of bad, Doki.

6836
04:06:24,920 --> 04:06:25,580
I think we're in trouble.

6837
04:06:26,940 --> 04:06:31,220
I got some soul sand.

6838
04:06:31,760 --> 04:06:32,460
Come here, come here.

6839
04:06:33,040 --> 04:06:34,120
Come here, come here.

6840
04:06:34,900 --> 04:06:36,520
I didn't get anything.

6841
04:06:38,320 --> 04:06:38,760
Oh, God.

6842
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:39,660
Oh, shit!

6843
04:06:39,880 --> 04:06:40,500
Oh, shit!

6844
04:06:40,880 --> 04:06:41,420
Oh, shit!

6845
04:06:50,670 --> 04:06:52,050
He came out of nowhere!

6846
04:06:53,070 --> 04:06:54,390
I see him.

6847
04:06:54,810 --> 04:06:55,950
I see him.

6848
04:06:56,190 --> 04:06:57,750
I see him.

6849
04:06:57,750 --> 04:06:58,790
Oh, my God.

6850
04:06:59,430 --> 04:07:00,870
Oh, my God.

6851
04:07:01,310 --> 04:07:01,950
Oh, my God.

6852
04:07:02,050 --> 04:07:02,810
Oh, there's two of them!

6853
04:07:02,910 --> 04:07:03,650
There's two of them!

6854
04:07:04,930 --> 04:07:06,250
They're looking at you.

6855
04:07:06,350 --> 04:07:07,590
They're looking at you.

6856
04:07:08,050 --> 04:07:09,390
Sir, I have one more gold.

6857
04:07:09,610 --> 04:07:10,350
Sir, please.

6858
04:07:10,970 --> 04:07:13,890
Sir, I have one more gold.

6859
04:07:14,510 --> 04:07:15,030
Oh, my God.

6860
04:07:15,090 --> 04:07:15,530
Oh, my God.

6861
04:07:15,590 --> 04:07:15,730
Please, please.

6862
04:07:15,730 --> 04:07:16,850
I have one more gold.

6863
04:07:17,190 --> 04:07:18,070
The spectral arrows!

6864
04:07:19,710 --> 04:07:22,050
Please, just one ender pearl, please.

6865
04:07:22,430 --> 04:07:23,750
I have my last...

6866
04:07:24,810 --> 04:07:26,190
I don't have any...

6867
04:07:27,970 --> 04:07:28,930
Why gravel?

6868
04:07:28,930 --> 04:07:29,810
I don't have a bow.

6869
04:07:32,070 --> 04:07:33,030
Why gravel?

6870
04:07:34,150 --> 04:07:34,630
Why?

6871
04:07:35,070 --> 04:07:36,430
Do you think he'll see me if I go down there?

6872
04:07:39,090 --> 04:07:39,830
Oh, my God.

6873
04:07:40,370 --> 04:07:41,290
Wait, where are you?

6874
04:07:41,290 --> 04:07:42,190
I'm afraid to deflect.

6875
04:07:42,530 --> 04:07:43,890
I'm afraid to deflect it.

6876
04:07:44,050 --> 04:07:45,010
OK, come here.

6877
04:07:45,330 --> 04:07:46,270
What's the status?

6878
04:07:47,510 --> 04:07:47,930
Come here.

6879
04:07:48,170 --> 04:07:49,450
I'm a little scared.

6880
04:07:50,170 --> 04:07:50,790
Of what?

6881
04:07:51,410 --> 04:07:52,550
I'm a little scared.

6882
04:07:52,830 --> 04:07:53,290
Of what?

6883
04:07:53,750 --> 04:07:54,430
Of dying.

6884
04:07:54,910 --> 04:07:55,490
Oh, me too.

6885
04:07:55,490 --> 04:07:56,670
Oh, shit.

6886
04:08:00,930 --> 04:08:02,650
Oh, my God.

6887
04:08:02,750 --> 04:08:03,230
I'm gonna die.

6888
04:08:03,350 --> 04:08:03,830
I'm gonna die.

6889
04:08:04,010 --> 04:08:04,270
Toki.

6890
04:08:04,770 --> 04:08:05,210
Toki.

6891
04:08:05,370 --> 04:08:05,510
Toki.

6892
04:08:05,650 --> 04:08:06,090
Toki.

6893
04:08:06,090 --> 04:08:06,710
Toki, I think I'm dead.

6894
04:08:06,730 --> 04:08:07,470
I think I'm dead, boy.

6895
04:08:09,250 --> 04:08:09,690
OK.

6896
04:08:10,470 --> 04:08:12,190
I'm just on fire a little bit.

6897
04:08:12,730 --> 04:08:13,210
Oh, God.

6898
04:08:14,510 --> 04:08:15,130
I'm OK.

6899
04:08:15,550 --> 04:08:17,310
I would be so sad.

6900
04:08:19,390 --> 04:08:21,030
How do we deflect them again?

6901
04:08:21,170 --> 04:08:23,150
You just hit it with your sword.

6902
04:08:24,150 --> 04:08:24,570
OK.

6903
04:08:26,070 --> 04:08:27,750
Like you're playing b-ball.

6904
04:08:28,230 --> 04:08:30,230
I mean, baseball, not b-ball.

6905
04:08:30,950 --> 04:08:32,190
I can do this.

6906
04:08:33,170 --> 04:08:33,430
Alright.

6907
04:08:33,790 --> 04:08:35,210
Why are you scared of deflecting?

6908
04:08:35,610 --> 04:08:36,730
Because I'm not good at it.

6909
04:08:37,270 --> 04:08:38,410
I've only done it once.

6910
04:08:38,970 --> 04:08:39,870
OK, I'm ready.

6911
04:08:40,670 --> 04:08:41,430
Look at me.

6912
04:08:41,510 --> 04:08:43,210
Why is he always looking at you and not me?

6913
04:08:43,350 --> 04:08:44,230
Where are you?

6914
04:08:44,550 --> 04:08:45,050
Oh, I see him.

6915
04:08:45,610 --> 04:08:48,110
Yeah, he's right there, but he's not looking at me.

6916
04:08:49,230 --> 04:08:50,090
Because... I don't know.

6917
04:08:51,430 --> 04:08:53,270
Wait, we didn't get the portal... OK, wait.

6918
04:08:53,270 --> 04:08:53,810
Wait, wait, wait.

6919
04:08:53,890 --> 04:08:54,470
Portal coordinates.

6920
04:08:54,470 --> 04:08:56,210
No, I got the portal coordinates.

6921
04:08:56,690 --> 04:08:57,750
Yeah, I screenshoted it.

6922
04:08:57,750 --> 04:08:58,370
How do we want to go?

6923
04:08:58,690 --> 04:08:59,210
Where do we go?

6924
04:08:59,690 --> 04:09:01,030
It's literally right down there.

6925
04:09:01,650 --> 04:09:02,370
No, no, no.

6926
04:09:02,430 --> 04:09:04,510
I meant like where do we go to try to find the fortress?

6927
04:09:05,130 --> 04:09:06,850
Wherever we can... I don't know.

6928
04:09:07,070 --> 04:09:08,470
Fortresses are random.

6929
04:09:08,890 --> 04:09:11,090
We just got... Wait, I think I see one right over there.

6930
04:09:11,250 --> 04:09:11,730
Wait, really?

6931
04:09:12,010 --> 04:09:13,470
Unless that's just built strangely.

6932
04:09:14,470 --> 04:09:15,070
Let's just go.

6933
04:09:15,190 --> 04:09:15,830
Let's just check it out.

6934
04:09:16,030 --> 04:09:16,390
Yeah, let's go.

6935
04:09:16,730 --> 04:09:19,410
Also get magma cubes because we need...

6936
04:09:19,970 --> 04:09:22,470
We need magma stuff for...

6937
04:09:23,170 --> 04:09:23,830
For what?

6938
04:09:23,830 --> 04:09:25,090
For potions.

6939
04:09:25,210 --> 04:09:25,650
Oh my gosh.

6940
04:09:25,770 --> 04:09:26,630
Get out of the way, Piggy.

6941
04:09:26,850 --> 04:09:27,430
Get out of the way.

6942
04:09:27,450 --> 04:09:28,770
I have a fire charge.

6943
04:09:29,270 --> 04:09:30,690
How many fire charges do we need?

6944
04:09:30,710 --> 04:09:31,550
No, it's magma.

6945
04:09:31,630 --> 04:09:32,450
It's not fire charge.

6946
04:09:32,550 --> 04:09:33,430
It's a magma slime.

6947
04:09:35,770 --> 04:09:36,130
Ouch!

6948
04:09:37,590 --> 04:09:38,450
Who hit me?

6949
04:09:39,350 --> 04:09:39,890
Not me.

6950
04:09:39,910 --> 04:09:40,170
Ouch!

6951
04:09:41,290 --> 04:09:43,830
I think it's the... I think it's the little... It's the magma.

6952
04:09:43,970 --> 04:09:44,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6953
04:09:44,490 --> 04:09:45,230
They hit you back.

6954
04:09:45,410 --> 04:09:46,390
OK, I give up.

6955
04:09:46,570 --> 04:09:47,510
The guy is too close.

6956
04:09:48,490 --> 04:09:51,050
Alright, so if we go over this way...

6957
04:09:51,050 --> 04:09:51,570
Where did you go?

6958
04:09:52,510 --> 04:09:53,170
Follow me.

6959
04:09:53,170 --> 04:09:53,590
Where did you go?

6960
04:09:54,090 --> 04:09:54,750
Follow me.

6961
04:09:54,870 --> 04:09:55,530
Oh, up here, up here.

6962
04:09:56,110 --> 04:09:56,770
We're going around.

6963
04:09:56,870 --> 04:09:57,970
We're going around this lava.

6964
04:09:58,350 --> 04:09:58,690
Alright.

6965
04:09:59,710 --> 04:10:00,730
We're going around it.

6966
04:10:00,850 --> 04:10:02,830
Just go up it.

6967
04:10:03,450 --> 04:10:04,970
Be careful of the other lava, though.

6968
04:10:06,030 --> 04:10:07,210
Here we go.

6969
04:10:07,410 --> 04:10:09,630
Why are we so close to that lava?

6970
04:10:10,530 --> 04:10:12,470
Why do we have to...

6971
04:10:12,470 --> 04:10:14,010
be right next to it?

6972
04:10:14,070 --> 04:10:14,450
I don't know.

6973
04:10:14,950 --> 04:10:15,870
I don't know.

6974
04:10:16,570 --> 04:10:19,950
We don't have to be next to it, so why are we doing that?

6975
04:10:20,370 --> 04:10:21,870
I don't think it's fine.

6976
04:10:21,870 --> 04:10:24,450
You're getting closer to the lava than me.

6977
04:10:24,590 --> 04:10:27,470
Oh my god, this pig is right on you.

6978
04:10:27,610 --> 04:10:29,350
Oh my god, leave us alone!

6979
04:10:30,370 --> 04:10:31,610
He's our biggest fan.

6980
04:10:33,050 --> 04:10:34,190
Where are you going?

6981
04:10:34,730 --> 04:10:35,530
You're supposed to...

6982
04:10:35,530 --> 04:10:36,610
No, we're going up.

6983
04:10:37,270 --> 04:10:38,190
I am already up.

6984
04:10:38,250 --> 04:10:38,770
What do you mean?

6985
04:10:40,190 --> 04:10:40,610
I'm up.

6986
04:10:40,990 --> 04:10:41,650
What are you doing?

6987
04:10:41,810 --> 04:10:42,710
Where are you?

6988
04:10:42,850 --> 04:10:44,170
What are you doing?

6989
04:10:44,830 --> 04:10:45,630
Just kidding.

6990
04:10:47,130 --> 04:10:50,010
So I'm doing the wrong thing, I guess.

6991
04:10:52,630 --> 04:10:54,730
My fire texture looks really weird.

6992
04:10:54,830 --> 04:10:57,730
Oh, I guess I was doing the wrong thing.

6993
04:10:58,470 --> 04:11:00,230
You were doing the wrong thing.

6994
04:11:01,090 --> 04:11:03,150
Oh, I think I didn't actually see one.

6995
04:11:03,290 --> 04:11:04,750
Maybe it was just a strange texture.

6996
04:11:05,270 --> 04:11:07,470
No, I thought it was one in the distance.

6997
04:11:08,030 --> 04:11:08,770
Is that not it?

6998
04:11:10,130 --> 04:11:11,370
What is that over there?

6999
04:11:12,330 --> 04:11:12,670
What?

7000
04:11:13,390 --> 04:11:15,990
Oh, it's just like little trees.

7001
04:11:16,490 --> 04:11:18,350
Yeah, we don't wanna go in there, though.

7002
04:11:18,810 --> 04:11:19,090
Why?

7003
04:11:19,190 --> 04:11:20,650
Oh, that's where the big pigs are, right?

7004
04:11:20,650 --> 04:11:21,810
Yeah, we hate those guys.

7005
04:11:22,210 --> 04:11:22,990
Okay, okay, okay.

7006
04:11:24,390 --> 04:11:26,430
We'll just go back here.

7007
04:11:26,990 --> 04:11:27,250
Okay.

7008
04:11:28,510 --> 04:11:29,310
We might as well.

7009
04:11:29,990 --> 04:11:30,270
Yeah.

7010
04:11:30,950 --> 04:11:32,390
Like, there's no other way to go.

7011
04:11:33,690 --> 04:11:35,330
We'll grab some mushrooms in case.

7012
04:11:35,470 --> 04:11:36,450
Is there any pigs around?

7013
04:11:36,730 --> 04:11:38,110
I'm gonna grab this gold.

7014
04:11:38,990 --> 04:11:39,930
And we can do more mining.

7015
04:11:43,490 --> 04:11:44,270
I'm checking.

7016
04:11:45,010 --> 04:11:45,850
Watch my back.

7017
04:11:46,210 --> 04:11:47,090
Watch my back.

7018
04:11:47,290 --> 04:11:47,930
I'm watching.

7019
04:11:48,210 --> 04:11:49,110
There's nothing here.

7020
04:11:49,230 --> 04:11:49,490
Okay.

7021
04:11:49,490 --> 04:11:51,470
There's literally nobody next to you.

7022
04:11:51,590 --> 04:11:51,770
Okay.

7023
04:11:52,330 --> 04:11:53,570
You're so safe.

7024
04:11:53,670 --> 04:11:53,910
Okay.

7025
04:11:54,010 --> 04:11:55,610
You're so safe right now.

7026
04:11:55,650 --> 04:11:55,890
Alright.

7027
04:11:56,470 --> 04:11:56,730
Cool.

7028
04:11:57,430 --> 04:11:58,530
What can I throw away?

7029
04:11:59,070 --> 04:12:00,190
Soul speed, go away.

7030
04:12:00,970 --> 04:12:02,250
Do we need soul sand?

7031
04:12:02,350 --> 04:12:03,010
We don't, right?

7032
04:12:04,030 --> 04:12:07,370
Okay, I'm gonna throw away the gravel...

7033
04:12:07,370 --> 04:12:09,810
and the crying obsidian.

7034
04:12:09,810 --> 04:12:11,250
Hey, why were you so far away?

7035
04:12:11,290 --> 04:12:12,170
What the hell, man?

7036
04:12:12,270 --> 04:12:12,710
What do you mean?

7037
04:12:12,810 --> 04:12:14,490
I was scouting you out.

7038
04:12:15,870 --> 04:12:18,090
I had to be high ground.

7039
04:12:20,850 --> 04:12:21,870
Oh, there's gold right here.

7040
04:12:21,950 --> 04:12:22,270
Nice.

7041
04:12:22,350 --> 04:12:22,630
Watch out!

7042
04:12:22,710 --> 04:12:23,030
No, no, no.

7043
04:12:23,370 --> 04:12:24,170
Oh, okay.

7044
04:12:24,810 --> 04:12:25,090
What?

7045
04:12:25,230 --> 04:12:26,030
It's not the... Okay.

7046
04:12:26,830 --> 04:12:28,190
The zombie guys are safe.

7047
04:12:28,390 --> 04:12:29,410
It's just the normal guys.

7048
04:12:29,430 --> 04:12:31,510
Wait, do they get mad if I farm their gold?

7049
04:12:31,670 --> 04:12:32,730
Yeah, they get jealous.

7050
04:12:32,830 --> 04:12:33,410
Wait, they do?

7051
04:12:33,570 --> 04:12:34,350
Yeah, they get jealous.

7052
04:12:35,830 --> 04:12:36,570
No, they don't.

7053
04:12:36,690 --> 04:12:38,550
Oh, we can get...

7054
04:12:39,110 --> 04:12:40,430
Hey, what the fuck, man?

7055
04:12:43,390 --> 04:12:45,150
Grab a blue mushroom.

7056
04:12:45,710 --> 04:12:46,370
Wait, what for?

7057
04:12:46,370 --> 04:12:49,770
We can also probably... They scare away the big hogs.

7058
04:12:49,790 --> 04:12:50,650
Oh, they do?

7059
04:12:50,790 --> 04:12:51,110
Yeah.

7060
04:12:52,150 --> 04:12:52,530
See?

7061
04:12:52,630 --> 04:12:54,010
You're a Minecraft expert.

7062
04:12:54,450 --> 04:12:56,790
We can also probably...

7063
04:12:56,790 --> 04:12:58,370
How do they scare them away?

7064
04:12:58,410 --> 04:12:59,990
Do we just take it out and be like...

7065
04:12:59,990 --> 04:13:01,230
Yeah, you like put it on the ground.

7066
04:13:01,750 --> 04:13:03,510
Oh, really?

7067
04:13:03,790 --> 04:13:04,870
But Warp Forest is good.

7068
04:13:04,930 --> 04:13:06,070
This is where all the Endermen are.

7069
04:13:06,130 --> 04:13:07,370
We can just farm Endermen here.

7070
04:13:09,390 --> 04:13:10,210
Where are they?

7071
04:13:10,430 --> 04:13:11,210
I see one.

7072
04:13:12,650 --> 04:13:13,170
Look at it.

7073
04:13:13,170 --> 04:13:13,970
Look at it right now.

7074
04:13:14,670 --> 04:13:16,210
But he's gonna come for me.

7075
04:13:16,210 --> 04:13:17,270
He's gonna come for me.

7076
04:13:17,270 --> 04:13:17,430
Where is he?

7077
04:13:17,490 --> 04:13:17,890
Where is he?

7078
04:13:17,930 --> 04:13:18,570
I'm gonna look at him.

7079
04:13:19,390 --> 04:13:20,070
Do you see him?

7080
04:13:20,650 --> 04:13:21,770
How can you not see him?

7081
04:13:22,270 --> 04:13:23,330
I'm literally looking at him.

7082
04:13:23,370 --> 04:13:24,170
He's not angry.

7083
04:13:25,230 --> 04:13:26,290
Look at him closer.

7084
04:13:27,170 --> 04:13:27,430
Okay.

7085
04:13:31,540 --> 04:13:33,260
Maybe let's build a little house.

7086
04:13:33,540 --> 04:13:33,800
Hold on.

7087
04:13:33,940 --> 04:13:34,600
He's not angry.

7088
04:13:34,980 --> 04:13:36,160
Hold on, I'm gonna build something.

7089
04:13:36,240 --> 04:13:37,600
I'm gonna build something for us to...

7090
04:13:37,600 --> 04:13:37,920
Look at me!

7091
04:13:38,420 --> 04:13:39,340
Look at me!

7092
04:13:39,640 --> 04:13:41,880
Look at me right now!

7093
04:13:43,640 --> 04:13:44,900
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

7094
04:13:44,900 --> 04:13:46,940
Do you think this is good enough?

7095
04:13:47,160 --> 04:13:47,740
Oh my god.

7096
04:13:47,880 --> 04:13:48,620
Get under here, Doki!

7097
04:13:48,900 --> 04:13:49,420
Get under here!

7098
04:13:52,960 --> 04:13:54,460
Yeah, now we kill.

7099
04:13:54,660 --> 04:13:55,320
Now we kill.

7100
04:13:56,760 --> 04:13:59,000
Oh, I looked it in his eyes.

7101
04:13:59,140 --> 04:14:00,080
He was not happy.

7102
04:14:01,960 --> 04:14:04,020
You guys, I got the portal coordinates.

7103
04:14:04,180 --> 04:14:05,720
I don't know why you guys are like...

7104
04:14:05,720 --> 04:14:07,300
Oh, rip the portal coordinates.

7105
04:14:07,400 --> 04:14:08,580
I literally got them.

7106
04:14:09,560 --> 04:14:10,540
Alright, we did it.

7107
04:14:12,660 --> 04:14:14,160
See, I ain't no coward.

7108
04:14:14,160 --> 04:14:15,260
Did you grab the...

7109
04:14:16,100 --> 04:14:17,640
No, he didn't drop any.

7110
04:14:17,720 --> 04:14:18,300
Oh, shit.

7111
04:14:19,820 --> 04:14:20,600
I wish we had fortune.

7112
04:14:20,700 --> 04:14:21,500
He didn't drop any.

7113
04:14:22,380 --> 04:14:23,000
Don't fall.

7114
04:14:24,280 --> 04:14:25,440
Don't fall here.

7115
04:14:25,840 --> 04:14:27,660
Oh, there was a hole right there.

7116
04:14:27,680 --> 04:14:27,940
I know.

7117
04:14:28,220 --> 04:14:29,440
This is kind of a bad spot.

7118
04:14:29,520 --> 04:14:30,980
Hold on, I'm gonna pick up shop.

7119
04:14:32,340 --> 04:14:33,500
Pick up shop?

7120
04:14:33,580 --> 04:14:34,400
We're gonna move shop.

7121
04:14:34,580 --> 04:14:35,480
Yeah, we're gonna move shop.

7122
04:14:37,580 --> 04:14:38,620
I'm gonna go this way.

7123
04:14:39,480 --> 04:14:42,220
Maybe we should have got fire resistance before we did this.

7124
04:14:42,990 --> 04:14:44,180
Oh, yeah.

7125
04:14:44,720 --> 04:14:45,720
I told you.

7126
04:14:47,340 --> 04:14:48,840
Where did you go?

7127
04:14:50,220 --> 04:14:51,560
Make a shop.

7128
04:14:51,720 --> 04:14:53,280
There's so many Endermen here.

7129
04:14:54,420 --> 04:14:55,280
Shop where?

7130
04:14:56,920 --> 04:14:58,140
I see two.

7131
04:15:00,380 --> 04:15:01,500
It's shop time.

7132
04:15:01,600 --> 04:15:02,080
Shop time.

7133
04:15:02,260 --> 04:15:02,620
This is it.

7134
04:15:02,900 --> 04:15:05,440
This is where we set up the family business.

7135
04:15:05,580 --> 04:15:06,960
Let me know when to look.

7136
04:15:07,200 --> 04:15:08,640
Don't look yet.

7137
04:15:09,380 --> 04:15:11,600
Don't look yet.

7138
04:15:12,220 --> 04:15:12,800
I'm gonna look.

7139
04:15:14,140 --> 04:15:16,180
That's your... If you feel safe.

7140
04:15:17,340 --> 04:15:18,440
Where's the second one?

7141
04:15:19,380 --> 04:15:20,240
Oh, there he is.

7142
04:15:20,940 --> 04:15:21,540
Oh, I see one.

7143
04:15:23,960 --> 04:15:24,940
Oh, my God.

7144
04:15:28,600 --> 04:15:29,400
We're so...

7145
04:15:29,400 --> 04:15:30,320
Oh, God.

7146
04:15:30,840 --> 04:15:31,100
Doki?

7147
04:15:31,240 --> 04:15:31,820
Where did he go?

7148
04:15:32,080 --> 04:15:32,640
He's dead.

7149
04:15:32,660 --> 04:15:32,920
He's dead.

7150
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:33,220
He's dead.

7151
04:15:33,380 --> 04:15:34,020
Where did he go?

7152
04:15:34,460 --> 04:15:34,860
He killed him.

7153
04:15:34,980 --> 04:15:35,220
He killed him.

7154
04:15:35,400 --> 04:15:35,800
Okay.

7155
04:15:36,220 --> 04:15:36,620
Okay.

7156
04:15:36,780 --> 04:15:38,180
I got a little worried.

7157
04:15:39,040 --> 04:15:41,060
Now we have to worry about a ghast too.

7158
04:15:41,380 --> 04:15:42,900
This is not the place to set up shop.

7159
04:15:43,680 --> 04:15:44,080
Oh, my God.

7160
04:15:44,160 --> 04:15:45,040
I hear him crying.

7161
04:15:45,240 --> 04:15:45,600
Oh, my God.

7162
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:46,760
Why did you do it again?

7163
04:15:46,820 --> 04:15:48,420
But there's literally a ghast on the run.

7164
04:15:48,780 --> 04:15:49,820
I'm gonna look at him.

7165
04:15:49,980 --> 04:15:50,840
I'm gonna do it.

7166
04:15:51,780 --> 04:15:52,960
I'm gonna look at him.

7167
04:15:53,040 --> 04:15:54,000
Where is the ghast?

7168
04:15:54,700 --> 04:15:56,060
He's like all the way over there.

7169
04:15:56,120 --> 04:15:56,940
How do we make a bow?

7170
04:15:57,060 --> 04:15:58,220
Do we have enough stuff for it?

7171
04:15:58,540 --> 04:15:59,260
I have string.

7172
04:15:59,880 --> 04:16:00,540
Hold on.

7173
04:16:00,980 --> 04:16:02,200
A boat or a bow?

7174
04:16:02,500 --> 04:16:02,820
A bow.

7175
04:16:04,360 --> 04:16:04,960
I can!

7176
04:16:05,380 --> 04:16:05,860
Oh, my gosh.

7177
04:16:05,900 --> 04:16:06,280
I can.

7178
04:16:06,400 --> 04:16:07,360
Oh, my God!

7179
04:16:07,360 --> 04:16:07,840
Yes!

7180
04:16:08,180 --> 04:16:08,400
Okay.

7181
04:16:08,700 --> 04:16:09,540
Am I looking at him?

7182
04:16:09,680 --> 04:16:11,100
Oh, I have no arrows though.

7183
04:16:11,240 --> 04:16:12,060
Am I looking at him?

7184
04:16:12,120 --> 04:16:12,880
Am I looking at him?

7185
04:16:12,960 --> 04:16:13,020
Am I looking at him?

7186
04:16:13,020 --> 04:16:13,800
Am I looking at him?

7187
04:16:14,060 --> 04:16:14,460
Okay.

7188
04:16:14,820 --> 04:16:15,900
Do something about it.

7189
04:16:15,900 --> 04:16:16,280
I don't know.

7190
04:16:16,900 --> 04:16:17,760
Where did he go?

7191
04:16:19,620 --> 04:16:20,920
Oh, he's not happy.

7192
04:16:21,480 --> 04:16:21,980
Kill him.

7193
04:16:22,860 --> 04:16:23,960
Just stay under the rocks.

7194
04:16:24,140 --> 04:16:25,060
Just stay under the rocks.

7195
04:16:25,360 --> 04:16:25,940
He'll come back.

7196
04:16:27,920 --> 04:16:28,340
He's just staring at me.

7197
04:16:28,340 --> 04:16:29,320
Oh, my spectral arrows.

7198
04:16:29,440 --> 04:16:29,860
That's right.

7199
04:16:29,960 --> 04:16:30,580
Oh, I have so many.

7200
04:16:30,580 --> 04:16:30,840
Hello.

7201
04:16:31,600 --> 04:16:32,700
You guys are so smart.

7202
04:16:33,040 --> 04:16:33,380
Hello.

7203
04:16:33,620 --> 04:16:34,680
What you gonna do?

7204
04:16:35,340 --> 04:16:35,740
Pussy?

7205
04:16:36,120 --> 04:16:36,840
Yeah, that's right.

7206
04:16:37,400 --> 04:16:38,760
What you gonna do?

7207
04:16:39,620 --> 04:16:39,620
Nothing.

7208
04:16:40,760 --> 04:16:42,160
Yeah, that's right.

7209
04:16:42,540 --> 04:16:43,060
Nothing.

7210
04:16:43,220 --> 04:16:44,320
He's stuck there.

7211
04:16:44,660 --> 04:16:45,560
Was he actually stuck?

7212
04:16:45,880 --> 04:16:47,040
Yeah, he's stuck down there.

7213
04:16:47,040 --> 04:16:48,180
Oh, dummy.

7214
04:16:49,020 --> 04:16:49,540
Wow.

7215
04:16:49,540 --> 04:16:50,520
Yeah, stupid.

7216
04:16:51,300 --> 04:16:51,980
Where did he go?

7217
04:16:52,440 --> 04:16:53,280
Where did he go?

7218
04:16:53,560 --> 04:16:54,100
Wait, wait.

7219
04:16:54,920 --> 04:16:55,920
Uh-oh.

7220
04:16:56,120 --> 04:16:57,260
I hear the gas again.

7221
04:16:58,580 --> 04:16:59,660
I don't see him.

7222
04:16:59,740 --> 04:17:00,320
I don't either.

7223
04:17:00,720 --> 04:17:03,200
The guy has 20-20 vision.

7224
04:17:03,620 --> 04:17:04,320
Oh, my God.

7225
04:17:04,340 --> 04:17:04,820
He's right here.

7226
04:17:05,380 --> 04:17:05,760
Get him, Ducky!

7227
04:17:06,400 --> 04:17:07,180
That's spooky.

7228
04:17:07,280 --> 04:17:08,300
What you gonna do?

7229
04:17:09,160 --> 04:17:09,160
Nothing.

7230
04:17:10,880 --> 04:17:13,580
Why aren't you under the 2x2?

7231
04:17:14,280 --> 04:17:15,360
Say under the 2x2.

7232
04:17:15,440 --> 04:17:16,000
Oh, he's right here.

7233
04:17:17,300 --> 04:17:18,280
He's on it!

7234
04:17:18,320 --> 04:17:19,240
He's on it!

7235
04:17:20,860 --> 04:17:22,020
Fill in the hole!

7236
04:17:22,460 --> 04:17:23,480
Fill in the hole!

7237
04:17:24,280 --> 04:17:26,640
I thought you said you were safe!

7238
04:17:27,020 --> 04:17:27,640
You liar!

7239
04:17:28,380 --> 04:17:30,340
No, you were leaving the hole!

7240
04:17:31,860 --> 04:17:33,360
I got in your prayer.

7241
04:17:33,360 --> 04:17:34,420
Okay, nice.

7242
04:17:34,780 --> 04:17:37,140
Our first ender pearl, everybody!

7243
04:17:37,900 --> 04:17:40,060
We got our first ender pearl!

7244
04:17:40,160 --> 04:17:41,340
Our first ender pearl!

7245
04:17:42,360 --> 04:17:43,960
Oh, my God.

7246
04:17:44,340 --> 04:17:46,560
How do people make this look so easy?

7247
04:17:47,320 --> 04:17:49,240
Let's figure this out.

7248
04:17:50,920 --> 04:17:51,340
Okay.

7249
04:17:51,660 --> 04:17:54,220
I don't know where that ghastly is and it's scaring me.

7250
04:17:54,320 --> 04:17:55,840
Stop calling it ghastly.

7251
04:17:56,080 --> 04:17:57,140
I like ghastlies.

7252
04:17:57,220 --> 04:17:58,280
I don't like these guys.

7253
04:17:59,040 --> 04:18:03,120
You see the Minecraft movie version of them?

7254
04:18:03,960 --> 04:18:04,440
No.

7255
04:18:04,940 --> 04:18:05,260
Oh, wait.

7256
04:18:05,340 --> 04:18:05,900
Maybe I did.

7257
04:18:06,020 --> 04:18:06,480
I don't remember.

7258
04:18:06,720 --> 04:18:08,400
They have, like, hair.

7259
04:18:08,900 --> 04:18:09,260
Ew!

7260
04:18:12,220 --> 04:18:14,540
They're, like, made out of skin and stuff.

7261
04:18:14,760 --> 04:18:15,740
Shut up, guys.

7262
04:18:16,320 --> 04:18:16,880
Okay, you wanna see?

7263
04:18:17,060 --> 04:18:17,820
Wait, let me...

7264
04:18:17,820 --> 04:18:18,160
Yeah.

7265
04:18:18,640 --> 04:18:20,360
You can't pause the game in Minecraft.

7266
04:18:20,760 --> 04:18:22,000
Don't use these blocks.

7267
04:18:22,080 --> 04:18:22,600
They suck.

7268
04:18:23,240 --> 04:18:23,720
Why not?

7269
04:18:23,840 --> 04:18:27,000
Because if a ghast gets us, they can blow them up.

7270
04:18:27,000 --> 04:18:28,260
They can't blow up other things.

7271
04:18:28,700 --> 04:18:30,240
They can't blow up clobble.

7272
04:18:30,420 --> 04:18:31,280
Yeah, clobble.

7273
04:18:32,100 --> 04:18:32,980
Okay, look.

7274
04:18:33,140 --> 04:18:33,720
I have one.

7275
04:18:33,880 --> 04:18:34,060
Okay.

7276
04:18:34,300 --> 04:18:35,460
Hey, what the hell?

7277
04:18:35,580 --> 04:18:36,200
What about me?

7278
04:18:36,640 --> 04:18:39,060
I'm trying to find the ghast.

7279
04:18:39,320 --> 04:18:39,840
Oh, my God.

7280
04:18:42,180 --> 04:18:44,080
Minecraft movie ghast.

7281
04:18:45,080 --> 04:18:45,520
Ghast.

7282
04:18:49,160 --> 04:18:50,540
This is what they look like.

7283
04:18:51,040 --> 04:18:52,200
They look so ugly.

7284
04:18:52,420 --> 04:18:53,120
They're, like...

7285
04:18:53,840 --> 04:18:54,580
They're, like...

7286
04:18:54,580 --> 04:18:54,900
Oh, my God.

7287
04:18:54,920 --> 04:18:55,540
I hear another one.

7288
04:18:55,540 --> 04:18:57,560
Skin and, like, hair.

7289
04:18:57,720 --> 04:18:58,740
And it looks so weird.

7290
04:18:58,780 --> 04:18:59,400
Did you send it to me?

7291
04:19:00,000 --> 04:19:00,600
No, not yet.

7292
04:19:00,660 --> 04:19:01,420
I'm trying to find Discord.

7293
04:19:02,200 --> 04:19:02,840
Oh, my God.

7294
04:19:03,140 --> 04:19:05,740
Where did my Discord go?

7295
04:19:06,700 --> 04:19:07,420
Oh, my God.

7296
04:19:07,420 --> 04:19:08,580
He sounds so close.

7297
04:19:09,140 --> 04:19:09,460
Oh, wait.

7298
04:19:09,480 --> 04:19:09,620
Here it is.

7299
04:19:09,680 --> 04:19:10,260
Oh, my God.

7300
04:19:10,260 --> 04:19:10,680
I see him.

7301
04:19:11,140 --> 04:19:11,620
Oh, my God.

7302
04:19:11,620 --> 04:19:12,380
He's really close.

7303
04:19:12,540 --> 04:19:12,880
Oh, my God.

7304
04:19:12,880 --> 04:19:14,820
If we were still over there, we would be dead-dead.

7305
04:19:16,520 --> 04:19:18,000
Alright, this is what they look like.

7306
04:19:20,400 --> 04:19:20,940
Hold on.

7307
04:19:20,980 --> 04:19:22,060
I'm trying to fight this guy.

7308
04:19:23,020 --> 04:19:23,980
Wait, you're fighting?

7309
04:19:24,960 --> 04:19:26,400
Oh, he's too far.

7310
04:19:26,600 --> 04:19:27,460
What the hell?

7311
04:19:28,520 --> 04:19:29,280
Wait, where are you?

7312
04:19:29,460 --> 04:19:29,940
I'm right here.

7313
04:19:30,000 --> 04:19:31,000
I'm right next to you.

7314
04:19:31,660 --> 04:19:32,280
You're not.

7315
04:19:33,360 --> 04:19:33,800
Ew!

7316
04:19:34,560 --> 04:19:34,740
Wait.

7317
04:19:35,300 --> 04:19:36,460
Oh, my God.

7318
04:19:38,060 --> 04:19:39,840
Why'd they make them look like that?

7319
04:19:40,160 --> 04:19:41,300
They're made of skin.

7320
04:19:41,680 --> 04:19:42,120
Skin.

7321
04:19:42,860 --> 04:19:45,200
It's skin and there's, like, a little bit of hair on it.

7322
04:19:45,820 --> 04:19:48,920
Okay, so the gas is, like, where I'm looking.

7323
04:19:49,100 --> 04:19:50,560
It's, like, that direction.

7324
04:19:51,160 --> 04:19:52,480
Oh, we don't have to look there.

7325
04:19:52,540 --> 04:19:53,380
We can just go forward.

7326
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:55,280
He might have despawned.

7327
04:19:55,280 --> 04:19:56,080
He made the bridge.

7328
04:19:57,060 --> 04:19:58,160
We might as well just go forward.

7329
04:20:01,100 --> 04:20:01,760
We'll find more Endermen.

7330
04:20:01,780 --> 04:20:02,840
Where are the Endermen?

7331
04:20:02,900 --> 04:20:03,420
Oh, I see one.

7332
04:20:03,500 --> 04:20:03,840
I see one.

7333
04:20:03,980 --> 04:20:04,740
We're setting up shop.

7334
04:20:04,900 --> 04:20:05,300
Set up shop.

7335
04:20:05,400 --> 04:20:05,740
Set up shop.

7336
04:20:05,840 --> 04:20:06,320
Set up shop.

7337
04:20:06,440 --> 04:20:06,920
Set up shop.

7338
04:20:07,040 --> 04:20:07,380
Set up shop.

7339
04:20:07,460 --> 04:20:08,080
Set up the shop.

7340
04:20:08,100 --> 04:20:08,820
Set up the shop.

7341
04:20:08,900 --> 04:20:09,720
Wait, where did you see him?

7342
04:20:13,040 --> 04:20:13,740
Where is he?

7343
04:20:14,280 --> 04:20:15,300
They're all over there.

7344
04:20:16,460 --> 04:20:17,000
I'm looking.

7345
04:20:17,300 --> 04:20:17,800
I'm looking.

7346
04:20:19,500 --> 04:20:20,100
I'm looking.

7347
04:20:21,000 --> 04:20:21,560
Do you see him?

7348
04:20:23,640 --> 04:20:24,040
Disappeared.

7349
04:20:24,200 --> 04:20:24,380
Oh, no.

7350
04:20:24,440 --> 04:20:24,900
He's right there.

7351
04:20:25,460 --> 04:20:26,140
I'm looking.

7352
04:20:26,620 --> 04:20:27,840
I'm looking right at him.

7353
04:20:28,020 --> 04:20:29,220
I think I got him.

7354
04:20:31,460 --> 04:20:32,240
Alright, nice.

7355
04:20:34,480 --> 04:20:35,540
This is so dumb.

7356
04:20:36,620 --> 04:20:37,320
Another one!

7357
04:20:37,400 --> 04:20:37,880
Another one!

7358
04:20:37,940 --> 04:20:38,220
Nice!

7359
04:20:38,880 --> 04:20:39,240
Nice.

7360
04:20:39,340 --> 04:20:40,440
You said there's another one here?

7361
04:20:40,540 --> 04:20:41,560
I thought I saw one.

7362
04:20:41,700 --> 04:20:42,500
I thought I saw two.

7363
04:20:43,100 --> 04:20:43,800
No, there's one.

7364
04:20:43,900 --> 04:20:46,800
Oh, you guys wanna see the ugly thing?

7365
04:20:46,880 --> 04:20:47,300
Hold on.

7366
04:20:48,040 --> 04:20:49,860
Just Google Minecraft movie gas.

7367
04:20:50,100 --> 04:20:51,140
Yeah, I'll save it.

7368
04:20:51,180 --> 04:20:52,720
I'll risk my life for you guys.

7369
04:20:53,380 --> 04:20:54,320
My life in Minecraft.

7370
04:20:54,740 --> 04:20:56,680
Okay, I'm gonna go find another Enderman.

7371
04:20:58,100 --> 04:20:58,540
What?

7372
04:21:00,320 --> 04:21:01,180
Setting up shop.

7373
04:21:01,620 --> 04:21:03,340
Oh, the shop is set up?

7374
04:21:03,860 --> 04:21:04,760
The shop is set up.

7375
04:21:04,800 --> 04:21:05,480
I found two.

7376
04:21:06,540 --> 04:21:08,000
I'm gonna eat meat before I look.

7377
04:21:08,520 --> 04:21:09,560
Gotta be hungry first.

7378
04:21:09,600 --> 04:21:10,380
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

7379
04:21:10,860 --> 04:21:11,480
Yeah, that's right.

7380
04:21:11,540 --> 04:21:12,520
I'm looking at you.

7381
04:21:12,740 --> 04:21:13,420
Yeah, that's right.

7382
04:21:13,420 --> 04:21:14,840
What you gonna do?

7383
04:21:15,240 --> 04:21:16,380
Yeah, what you gonna do?

7384
04:21:17,460 --> 04:21:18,260
I ain't scared.

7385
04:21:18,800 --> 04:21:20,260
I'm gonna look into your eyes.

7386
04:21:20,260 --> 04:21:22,860
Why isn't it aggroing?

7387
04:21:24,800 --> 04:21:27,100
Alright guys, this is what they look like in the movie.

7388
04:21:27,720 --> 04:21:27,860
Wait.

7389
04:21:30,340 --> 04:21:30,860
Nasty.

7390
04:21:31,880 --> 04:21:32,380
I'm looking.

7391
04:21:32,760 --> 04:21:32,820
You.

7392
04:21:33,440 --> 04:21:33,960
You.

7393
04:21:34,180 --> 04:21:34,440
I'm looking.

7394
04:21:35,060 --> 04:21:35,580
Nasty.

7395
04:21:35,640 --> 04:21:36,560
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

7396
04:21:36,700 --> 04:21:37,840
I think you're ugly.

7397
04:21:38,900 --> 04:21:39,760
That's right.

7398
04:21:41,420 --> 04:21:42,500
Oh, oh, I see you.

7399
04:21:43,460 --> 04:21:44,580
He baited me!

7400
04:21:45,860 --> 04:21:47,040
There you go.

7401
04:21:47,380 --> 04:21:49,420
He ran away and then ran.

7402
04:21:49,420 --> 04:21:50,980
Oh, ouch, ouch.

7403
04:21:51,740 --> 04:21:54,240
He baited a 360 at me.

7404
04:21:54,820 --> 04:21:55,680
Oh, he dropped one too.

7405
04:21:55,760 --> 04:21:56,160
He dropped one.

7406
04:21:56,320 --> 04:21:56,780
I got three.

7407
04:21:57,000 --> 04:21:57,000
Nice.

7408
04:21:57,020 --> 04:21:57,260
Okay.

7409
04:21:58,900 --> 04:22:01,620
I can't tell if I aggroed that one or if she did.

7410
04:22:02,200 --> 04:22:03,620
I can't tell either.

7411
04:22:04,620 --> 04:22:05,700
Wait, there was two.

7412
04:22:05,820 --> 04:22:06,880
The other guy despawned.

7413
04:22:06,980 --> 04:22:07,200
No.

7414
04:22:08,220 --> 04:22:09,020
I'll look around too.

7415
04:22:10,740 --> 04:22:11,560
There's two here.

7416
04:22:11,800 --> 04:22:12,240
Nice.

7417
04:22:13,120 --> 04:22:15,200
Okay, I'm gonna keep that shop.

7418
04:22:15,640 --> 04:22:17,020
Keep the shop is set up.

7419
04:22:17,120 --> 04:22:18,060
Shop is set up.

7420
04:22:18,060 --> 04:22:18,540
Let's keep it.

7421
04:22:18,840 --> 04:22:20,000
It's like our little food truck.

7422
04:22:20,260 --> 04:22:20,540
Yeah.

7423
04:22:22,300 --> 04:22:23,800
As soon as you see one, just run.

7424
04:22:24,200 --> 04:22:25,420
Look and run back to shop.

7425
04:22:27,520 --> 04:22:28,480
Is he following me?

7426
04:22:28,540 --> 04:22:29,160
Is he following me?

7427
04:22:29,940 --> 04:22:31,060
I turned around!

7428
04:22:31,200 --> 04:22:31,740
I turned around!

7429
04:22:32,200 --> 04:22:32,860
Oh my God.

7430
04:22:33,080 --> 04:22:34,900
Oh, I almost ran the wrong way.

7431
04:22:35,340 --> 04:22:36,660
Oh my God, is he chasing me?

7432
04:22:36,680 --> 04:22:37,360
Never look back.

7433
04:22:37,720 --> 04:22:38,540
Never look back.

7434
04:22:40,540 --> 04:22:41,300
Did he drop one?

7435
04:22:41,760 --> 04:22:42,540
He got four.

7436
04:22:42,640 --> 04:22:43,300
Yeah, he dropped one.

7437
04:22:43,360 --> 04:22:43,940
We're getting lucky.

7438
04:22:44,460 --> 04:22:44,800
Nice.

7439
04:22:45,640 --> 04:22:46,440
Oh, I see one.

7440
04:22:46,440 --> 04:22:47,260
Oh my God.

7441
04:22:49,220 --> 04:22:49,940
Oh my God.

7442
04:22:50,020 --> 04:22:50,140
Run!

7443
04:22:53,460 --> 04:22:54,380
Come here.

7444
04:22:54,780 --> 04:22:55,160
Come here.

7445
04:22:55,460 --> 04:22:55,900
Come here.

7446
04:22:56,000 --> 04:22:56,800
Drop your goods.

7447
04:22:57,140 --> 04:22:58,100
Drop your goods.

7448
04:22:58,660 --> 04:22:59,420
Drop your goods.

7449
04:22:59,620 --> 04:23:00,240
Run by!

7450
04:23:02,100 --> 04:23:03,180
I don't know if...

7451
04:23:03,180 --> 04:23:03,920
He didn't.

7452
04:23:03,980 --> 04:23:04,400
He didn't.

7453
04:23:04,520 --> 04:23:05,320
Oh, come on.

7454
04:23:05,320 --> 04:23:05,940
It's just me.

7455
04:23:07,600 --> 04:23:08,420
Oh my God.

7456
04:23:08,520 --> 04:23:10,450
That guy looked at me and then he like...

7457
04:23:12,100 --> 04:23:15,140
Oh, it's probably because he was aggroed on me.

7458
04:23:15,740 --> 04:23:16,920
The other guy.

7459
04:23:17,020 --> 04:23:18,400
I found another Enderman.

7460
04:23:23,300 --> 04:23:24,780
So far, not so bad though.

7461
04:23:24,780 --> 04:23:25,300
Don't look back.

7462
04:23:25,440 --> 04:23:25,560
Don't look back.

7463
04:23:25,560 --> 04:23:26,080
Oh, I see him.

7464
04:23:26,120 --> 04:23:26,500
I see him.

7465
04:23:26,520 --> 04:23:26,860
He's coming.

7466
04:23:27,120 --> 04:23:27,500
Don't look back.

7467
04:23:27,660 --> 04:23:27,760
Don't look back.

7468
04:23:27,760 --> 04:23:28,120
Oh, he's going.

7469
04:23:28,380 --> 04:23:28,780
Don't look back.

7470
04:23:29,020 --> 04:23:29,760
Don't look back.

7471
04:23:32,840 --> 04:23:33,240
Yeah!

7472
04:23:34,540 --> 04:23:35,580
Get his ass!

7473
04:23:36,160 --> 04:23:36,320
Yeah!

7474
04:23:36,380 --> 04:23:37,840
You're in the wrong neighborhood!

7475
04:23:38,140 --> 04:23:38,540
Yeah!

7476
04:23:38,820 --> 04:23:39,600
We'll take you out.

7477
04:23:40,000 --> 04:23:40,260
Nothing?

7478
04:23:40,580 --> 04:23:41,220
Oh, come on.

7479
04:23:41,300 --> 04:23:41,820
No, he was broke.

7480
04:23:41,820 --> 04:23:44,560
Okay, I need to stop attacking him because clearly...

7481
04:23:44,560 --> 04:23:46,200
He was fucking broke.

7482
04:23:46,200 --> 04:23:48,920
Watch out because there's a really big drop here.

7483
04:23:50,120 --> 04:23:51,820
Look in the trees too, but...

7484
04:23:51,820 --> 04:23:51,820
Oh, yeah.

7485
04:23:51,820 --> 04:23:53,820
I'm way too confident with jumping around.

7486
04:23:54,340 --> 04:23:54,880
I know.

7487
04:23:55,920 --> 04:23:58,340
I'm like, whoa, there's no holes here.

7488
04:24:03,220 --> 04:24:05,140
Oh, I think that's just a normal Skelly.

7489
04:24:05,360 --> 04:24:05,620
Oh, wait.

7490
04:24:05,680 --> 04:24:06,940
Or is that an Enderman up there?

7491
04:24:07,300 --> 04:24:08,040
Oh, that's an Enderman.

7492
04:24:08,420 --> 04:24:09,900
Do you think... Is it too far?

7493
04:24:10,800 --> 04:24:11,540
Look at him.

7494
04:24:11,660 --> 04:24:13,340
Look him in the eye and ask if it's too far.

7495
04:24:14,080 --> 04:24:15,320
Oh, he disappeared.

7496
04:24:16,200 --> 04:24:17,340
Oh, maybe it was too far.

7497
04:24:17,400 --> 04:24:18,460
He was really far away.

7498
04:24:19,960 --> 04:24:21,860
It's a 50% chance to drop.

7499
04:24:23,340 --> 04:24:23,740
Oh, wait.

7500
04:24:23,760 --> 04:24:24,120
I see him.

7501
04:24:26,060 --> 04:24:26,420
Where?

7502
04:24:26,760 --> 04:24:27,480
Oh, I see him too.

7503
04:24:27,520 --> 04:24:28,400
He's really far.

7504
04:24:29,340 --> 04:24:30,640
I see all the way over there.

7505
04:24:31,240 --> 04:24:32,480
I think it's too far for me.

7506
04:24:32,600 --> 04:24:34,520
I don't think he wants to play with us.

7507
04:24:34,620 --> 04:24:34,860
No.

7508
04:24:36,220 --> 04:24:36,860
What is that?

7509
04:24:37,720 --> 04:24:37,980
What?

7510
04:24:38,180 --> 04:24:40,020
Was that ambiance or is that an Enderman?

7511
04:24:40,440 --> 04:24:40,800
What?

7512
04:24:41,380 --> 04:24:42,620
I don't see any near us.

7513
04:24:43,700 --> 04:24:44,580
I heard something.

7514
04:24:44,720 --> 04:24:47,080
Let's just move on from here and see if we can find a fortress.

7515
04:24:47,800 --> 04:24:49,220
But we need the Enderpearls.

7516
04:24:49,520 --> 04:24:50,660
Yeah, but we're gonna find more.

7517
04:24:50,680 --> 04:24:51,960
We'll find more Endermans later.

7518
04:24:52,420 --> 04:24:54,140
This is the Enderman place.

7519
04:24:55,200 --> 04:24:57,060
The fortress is more harder.

7520
04:24:57,520 --> 04:25:00,560
Like, if we survive the fortress, then it's fine.

7521
04:25:01,380 --> 04:25:03,740
Like, if we spend all our time trying to get...

7522
04:25:03,740 --> 04:25:04,560
No, wait.

7523
04:25:04,640 --> 04:25:05,620
I think we actually...

7524
04:25:05,620 --> 04:25:09,740
No, I think we need to leave and get the fire potions before we go to the fortress.

7525
04:25:13,060 --> 04:25:13,540
Okay.

7526
04:25:17,260 --> 04:25:21,160
I think that's our best plan of action.

7527
04:25:21,420 --> 04:25:21,960
You're right.

7528
04:25:22,080 --> 04:25:26,520
No, you're 100% right there.

7529
04:25:28,120 --> 04:25:29,480
I thought about it.

7530
04:25:29,540 --> 04:25:31,840
I was like, no, I think we're gonna fall into...

7531
04:25:31,840 --> 04:25:33,420
I think we're gonna fall in that lava.

7532
04:25:33,740 --> 04:25:35,260
And what do we need for fire potions?

7533
04:25:35,820 --> 04:25:39,620
We need the magma cubes, but we might be able to, like...

7534
04:25:40,140 --> 04:25:40,960
Oh, we can leave that.

7535
04:25:41,760 --> 04:25:44,340
Wait, but how do we find the magma cubes?

7536
04:25:44,760 --> 04:25:45,700
Oh my God, there's a ghast.

7537
04:25:45,800 --> 04:25:46,200
Be careful.

7538
04:25:47,600 --> 04:25:48,440
I'm gonna deflect him.

7539
04:25:48,600 --> 04:25:48,960
Watch this.

7540
04:25:48,960 --> 04:25:49,500
Okay, do it.

7541
04:25:50,320 --> 04:25:51,280
I'm gonna watch this.

7542
04:25:52,520 --> 04:25:55,740
But if he hits you and, like, you don't deflect...

7543
04:25:55,740 --> 04:25:59,280
And, like, it explodes around you, you might fall into the lava.

7544
04:26:00,060 --> 04:26:00,620
Oh, shit.

7545
04:26:00,680 --> 04:26:01,780
I won't watch this.

7546
04:26:01,940 --> 04:26:02,300
Do it.

7547
04:26:08,220 --> 04:26:09,100
Okay, um...

7548
04:26:09,100 --> 04:26:10,920
I thought you said just hit it!

7549
04:26:11,020 --> 04:26:11,500
You do!

7550
04:26:12,740 --> 04:26:13,880
I don't think so.

7551
04:26:15,760 --> 04:26:18,380
Okay, why don't we stand together and maybe one of us will hit it.

7552
04:26:18,620 --> 04:26:20,340
I don't wanna try that.

7553
04:26:21,480 --> 04:26:22,520
I wanna go.

7554
04:26:24,880 --> 04:26:25,440
You know what?

7555
04:26:25,600 --> 04:26:26,600
I think I can do it.

7556
04:26:26,620 --> 04:26:27,480
Just trade with the pigs.

7557
04:26:27,580 --> 04:26:29,320
Have you... Oh wait, I actually still have more gold.

7558
04:26:29,460 --> 04:26:30,280
Hold on, let me try trading.

7559
04:26:30,300 --> 04:26:30,640
Wait, I do too.

7560
04:26:30,720 --> 04:26:31,120
I do too.

7561
04:26:31,120 --> 04:26:31,760
Yeah, let's keep trading.

7562
04:26:31,920 --> 04:26:32,540
I can craft.

7563
04:26:32,900 --> 04:26:33,340
Come here.

7564
04:26:36,820 --> 04:26:38,360
I'm gonna craft my gold.

7565
04:26:38,360 --> 04:26:39,540
Oh yeah, here.

7566
04:26:39,760 --> 04:26:40,580
I have 50.

7567
04:26:40,860 --> 04:26:41,540
Take these.

7568
04:26:41,960 --> 04:26:42,400
Take those.

7569
04:26:42,480 --> 04:26:43,140
Yeah, I have some too.

7570
04:26:43,200 --> 04:26:43,820
I'm crafting too.

7571
04:26:43,840 --> 04:26:44,360
What did he give me?

7572
04:26:45,600 --> 04:26:46,320
I don't even know.

7573
04:26:46,360 --> 04:26:47,400
Oh, I think he gave me soul sand.

7574
04:26:49,160 --> 04:26:50,980
Here, take that.

7575
04:26:51,080 --> 04:26:51,380
Take that.

7576
04:26:51,620 --> 04:26:51,980
Take that.

7577
04:26:52,060 --> 04:26:52,400
Take that.

7578
04:26:52,680 --> 04:26:52,900
Mister.

7579
04:26:53,440 --> 04:26:53,680
Mister.

7580
04:26:54,860 --> 04:26:55,180
Mister.

7581
04:27:00,900 --> 04:27:01,260
Blackstone.

7582
04:27:03,760 --> 04:27:04,480
I'm crafting.

7583
04:27:08,400 --> 04:27:09,680
Wait, did he steal the nuggets?

7584
04:27:10,000 --> 04:27:10,760
Or did you get them?

7585
04:27:11,000 --> 04:27:11,580
No, I got them.

7586
04:27:11,640 --> 04:27:12,080
I got them.

7587
04:27:12,080 --> 04:27:12,460
Okay, okay, okay.

7588
04:27:12,500 --> 04:27:13,740
Alright, gotcha time.

7589
04:27:13,860 --> 04:27:17,160
Wait, why didn't he... He didn't give me anything.

7590
04:27:17,300 --> 04:27:18,060
Unless you took it.

7591
04:27:18,600 --> 04:27:19,380
Did I take it?

7592
04:27:19,460 --> 04:27:20,140
I don't know.

7593
04:27:20,520 --> 04:27:21,820
I don't know what I have in here.

7594
04:27:24,280 --> 04:27:25,320
Oh, I don't know.

7595
04:27:25,540 --> 04:27:26,240
I don't think it was that.

7596
04:27:27,340 --> 04:27:28,540
Okay, he's giving me gravel.

7597
04:27:29,140 --> 04:27:29,500
Gravel?

7598
04:27:30,200 --> 04:27:31,760
He's giving me fucking gravel.

7599
04:27:33,260 --> 04:27:33,800
What else?

7600
04:27:33,800 --> 04:27:34,280
Wait, wait, wait.

7601
04:27:34,420 --> 04:27:36,520
I got soul speed 3.

7602
04:27:36,600 --> 04:27:38,840
What the fuck am I gonna do with soul speed 3?

7603
04:27:39,060 --> 04:27:40,060
Yeah, he gave me that too.

7604
04:27:41,100 --> 04:27:41,720
This sucks.

7605
04:27:41,940 --> 04:27:43,360
Hey, throw them over here mister.

7606
04:27:43,540 --> 04:27:44,360
Don't look that way.

7607
04:27:45,060 --> 04:27:47,200
Oh my god, I hear another... I hear another gas.

7608
04:27:47,920 --> 04:27:50,020
He got me... He gave me more...

7609
04:27:50,020 --> 04:27:50,460
Oh shit!

7610
04:27:51,680 --> 04:27:52,080
Oh,

7611
04:27:56,240 --> 04:27:56,980
you did it!

7612
04:27:57,080 --> 04:27:57,780
I did it!

7613
04:27:57,840 --> 04:27:59,260
Was that cool or not?

7614
04:27:59,500 --> 04:28:00,540
That was pretty cool.

7615
04:28:01,220 --> 04:28:02,280
Gosh, I can do it again.

7616
04:28:02,280 --> 04:28:03,220
Hold on, there's two of them.

7617
04:28:03,760 --> 04:28:04,500
There's two of them.

7618
04:28:04,680 --> 04:28:04,880
Do it!

7619
04:28:05,060 --> 04:28:05,180
Do it!

7620
04:28:05,260 --> 04:28:05,660
Do it!

7621
04:28:07,040 --> 04:28:07,580
Do it!

7622
04:28:09,480 --> 04:28:10,540
Yeah, that's fucking right.

7623
04:28:10,680 --> 04:28:11,340
Oh, he can't aim.

7624
04:28:11,360 --> 04:28:12,260
He can't aim.

7625
04:28:12,680 --> 04:28:13,400
He can't aim.

7626
04:28:13,480 --> 04:28:14,180
Oh, he can aim.

7627
04:28:14,680 --> 04:28:15,240
He can aim.

7628
04:28:16,400 --> 04:28:17,480
Oh, he's aiming at you.

7629
04:28:17,620 --> 04:28:17,820
Oh shit!

7630
04:28:18,100 --> 04:28:18,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

7631
04:28:20,360 --> 04:28:21,020
What if I try?

7632
04:28:21,640 --> 04:28:22,420
I'm gonna gotcha.

7633
04:28:22,560 --> 04:28:23,040
Did you hit it?

7634
04:28:23,380 --> 04:28:23,740
No.

7635
04:28:23,860 --> 04:28:24,660
I don't think you hit it.

7636
04:28:24,680 --> 04:28:25,060
I didn't.

7637
04:28:25,760 --> 04:28:27,120
I wasn't ready for it.

7638
04:28:27,940 --> 04:28:28,700
What did he give me?

7639
04:28:29,320 --> 04:28:30,140
What did he give me?

7640
04:28:30,760 --> 04:28:32,020
I can't see.

7641
04:28:32,620 --> 04:28:34,120
Oh, this is like all destroyed.

7642
04:28:35,320 --> 04:28:36,040
What is that?

7643
04:28:36,120 --> 04:28:37,200
Oh, it's iron nuggets.

7644
04:28:39,320 --> 04:28:40,200
That's fine.

7645
04:28:42,040 --> 04:28:44,120
Oh, wait, is that netherite bricks?

7646
04:28:44,980 --> 04:28:46,680
No, is it iron bricks?

7647
04:28:47,100 --> 04:28:48,040
Or the...

7648
04:28:48,040 --> 04:28:49,140
Just the...

7649
04:28:50,080 --> 04:28:50,840
What is that?

7650
04:28:51,440 --> 04:28:52,540
Oh, it's nether brick!

7651
04:28:52,640 --> 04:28:53,520
Wait, that's good!

7652
04:28:53,680 --> 04:28:55,080
Wait, he actually gave you nether brick?

7653
04:28:55,500 --> 04:28:55,880
Yeah!

7654
04:28:55,940 --> 04:28:56,620
Oh, nice call.

7655
04:28:56,780 --> 04:28:58,120
I hit him big!

7656
04:28:58,180 --> 04:28:58,880
I gotcha!

7657
04:29:00,500 --> 04:29:01,760
Isn't nether bricks good?

7658
04:29:02,660 --> 04:29:04,680
Yeah, that's what you need to make the netherite.

7659
04:29:05,300 --> 04:29:06,620
Yeah, isn't it?

7660
04:29:07,120 --> 04:29:07,440
Yeah!

7661
04:29:07,620 --> 04:29:08,400
Oh, no, it's not.

7662
04:29:08,460 --> 04:29:09,280
You're fucking with me.

7663
04:29:09,500 --> 04:29:09,980
Oh, it's not.

7664
04:29:10,080 --> 04:29:11,120
It's nether brick.

7665
04:29:11,280 --> 04:29:14,300
Oh, I thought you meant it was netherite brick.

7666
04:29:14,740 --> 04:29:20,980
Oh, I thought it was nether... I thought that meant netherite because it says nether in it.

7667
04:29:21,360 --> 04:29:23,220
So I was like, oh, that's cool.

7668
04:29:27,000 --> 04:29:28,680
You wanna find another guy?

7669
04:29:29,620 --> 04:29:29,940
Yeah.

7670
04:29:30,300 --> 04:29:31,440
Let's go find another guy.

7671
04:29:31,520 --> 04:29:34,120
His payout, his gotcha rates were a little too high.

7672
04:29:34,420 --> 04:29:34,580
Yeah, a little too high.

7673
04:29:34,580 --> 04:29:35,280
A little too low.

7674
04:29:35,880 --> 04:29:36,500
A little too low.

7675
04:29:37,800 --> 04:29:38,640
Oh, there's a guy over here.

7676
04:29:38,700 --> 04:29:39,180
There's a guy here.

7677
04:29:39,540 --> 04:29:39,980
Hey, hey, hey!

7678
04:29:39,980 --> 04:29:40,360
Come here!

7679
04:29:40,600 --> 04:29:40,920
Hey!

7680
04:29:41,940 --> 04:29:42,600
Yeah, that's right.

7681
04:29:42,640 --> 04:29:43,300
Come down here.

7682
04:29:44,520 --> 04:29:45,160
Go buy gravel.

7683
04:29:46,560 --> 04:29:47,580
Yeah, work for us.

7684
04:29:50,020 --> 04:29:51,940
Go, take the gold.

7685
04:29:51,940 --> 04:29:52,280
Yeah, take that.

7686
04:29:52,360 --> 04:29:52,940
Take that gold.

7687
04:29:58,100 --> 04:29:58,660
What'd he give?

7688
04:29:58,800 --> 04:29:59,440
What'd he give me?

7689
04:30:00,220 --> 04:30:01,480
Sometimes I don't know.

7690
04:30:01,640 --> 04:30:02,000
I know.

7691
04:30:03,260 --> 04:30:05,020
Sometimes I can't tell what I'm already holding.

7692
04:30:05,040 --> 04:30:05,760
That's gravel?

7693
04:30:06,140 --> 04:30:06,880
That's gravel?

7694
04:30:07,040 --> 04:30:07,820
I don't want that.

7695
04:30:07,980 --> 04:30:09,180
Oh, I got the nether brick.

7696
04:30:09,680 --> 04:30:10,360
The elusive nether brick.

7697
04:30:10,380 --> 04:30:11,920
Yeah, that's the one I threw away.

7698
04:30:12,040 --> 04:30:12,320
Yeah.

7699
04:30:13,460 --> 04:30:15,680
I got more gold here though.

7700
04:30:15,800 --> 04:30:16,300
Gold nuggets.

7701
04:30:16,900 --> 04:30:17,820
Oh, don't do it in front of him!

7702
04:30:17,920 --> 04:30:19,100
Don't do it in front of him, he'll get angry.

7703
04:30:19,680 --> 04:30:20,260
No, he didn't.

7704
04:30:20,320 --> 04:30:20,980
He didn't look.

7705
04:30:20,980 --> 04:30:23,440
Oh, I think it's because he's busy with the...

7706
04:30:24,360 --> 04:30:27,440
Yeah, as long as I throw it in front of...

7707
04:30:29,440 --> 04:30:29,820
Come on.

7708
04:30:31,820 --> 04:30:32,940
Come on.

7709
04:30:33,860 --> 04:30:35,800
I wanna kill him so bad.

7710
04:30:37,920 --> 04:30:38,880
Oh, I got...

7711
04:30:38,880 --> 04:30:39,960
It's a fire potion!

7712
04:30:40,280 --> 04:30:41,240
Yeah, fire resistance!

7713
04:30:41,400 --> 04:30:41,740
I got fire resistance!

7714
04:30:42,200 --> 04:30:42,480
Nice!

7715
04:30:43,380 --> 04:30:44,220
What'd he give you?

7716
04:30:44,240 --> 04:30:44,660
Obsidian.

7717
04:30:45,340 --> 04:30:45,560
Okay.

7718
04:30:49,430 --> 04:30:50,690
That's more gravel.

7719
04:30:51,790 --> 04:30:53,110
Alright, we got fire resistance.

7720
04:30:54,110 --> 04:30:54,650
Oh my God.

7721
04:30:54,830 --> 04:30:55,850
Alright, let's head back.

7722
04:30:56,130 --> 04:30:56,630
Okay, yeah.

7723
04:30:57,210 --> 04:31:00,810
So we need to kill magma cubes, but we can't kill them though.

7724
04:31:01,210 --> 04:31:03,730
Like, we need to find magma cubes for more fire resistance.

7725
04:31:03,970 --> 04:31:05,570
Unless we find for more gold.

7726
04:31:06,930 --> 04:31:08,030
And just keep gacha-ing.

7727
04:31:08,710 --> 04:31:11,210
That might be an option, yeah.

7728
04:31:11,710 --> 04:31:15,070
I feel like magma cubes are harder for fire resistance.

7729
04:31:15,650 --> 04:31:17,310
For where we spawned in?

7730
04:31:17,370 --> 04:31:17,890
Yeah, maybe.

7731
04:31:20,050 --> 04:31:20,970
Might just be easier.

7732
04:31:22,070 --> 04:31:23,470
Time to just gacha.

7733
04:31:24,770 --> 04:31:26,450
I love gacha.

7734
04:31:26,530 --> 04:31:27,550
I love gacha.

7735
04:31:28,010 --> 04:31:29,710
I love...

7736
04:31:29,710 --> 04:31:31,110
Wait, where did I leave my chest?

7737
04:31:31,750 --> 04:31:32,970
Oh, over here.

7738
04:31:36,290 --> 04:31:37,790
We need the warts too.

7739
04:31:38,250 --> 04:31:39,870
The blue ones?

7740
04:31:41,150 --> 04:31:43,050
The blue mushrooms, we need those.

7741
04:31:44,970 --> 04:31:46,610
I threw away my mushrooms.

7742
04:31:47,330 --> 04:31:48,750
We need a lot of blaze rods.

7743
04:31:49,950 --> 04:31:52,030
Wait, why did you throw away your mushrooms?

7744
04:31:52,730 --> 04:31:54,710
Because I didn't know we needed it.

7745
04:31:55,010 --> 04:31:55,410
Yeah!

7746
04:31:56,390 --> 04:31:57,510
We need them!

7747
04:31:57,630 --> 04:31:58,450
Okay, I'll go back in.

7748
04:31:59,150 --> 04:32:00,230
It's right there.

7749
04:32:00,350 --> 04:32:01,950
It's right there, I'll go in.

7750
04:32:02,170 --> 04:32:03,350
I'll go in, it's right there.

7751
04:32:04,470 --> 04:32:07,110
It's right there, I'll go in.

7752
04:32:07,190 --> 04:32:07,750
Chill out.

7753
04:32:08,070 --> 04:32:11,330
I might be able to kill some more endermen on the way.

7754
04:32:12,530 --> 04:32:13,190
Like that guy.

7755
04:32:13,430 --> 04:32:13,750
Come here.

7756
04:32:14,850 --> 04:32:15,610
Come here, stupid.

7757
04:32:16,510 --> 04:32:17,750
Wait, did you get trapped down there?

7758
04:32:17,930 --> 04:32:18,770
Oh no, he's not.

7759
04:32:19,150 --> 04:32:19,570
What about you?

7760
04:32:19,570 --> 04:32:22,310
I'm just throwing away stuff right now.

7761
04:32:24,790 --> 04:32:26,710
We don't need obsidian anymore, right?

7762
04:32:27,590 --> 04:32:28,590
I don't think so.

7763
04:32:29,150 --> 04:32:30,470
Okay, goodbye obsidian.

7764
04:32:31,030 --> 04:32:33,890
Wait, chat, we don't need obsidian anymore, right?

7765
04:32:34,470 --> 04:32:36,050
I don't know why I asked you.

7766
04:32:37,810 --> 04:32:39,390
Nether warts are from the fortress.

7767
04:32:41,810 --> 04:32:44,110
Oh my gosh, I'm not doing very well with these.

7768
04:32:44,190 --> 04:32:45,390
Oh, enchanting tables.

7769
04:32:45,810 --> 04:32:47,990
Wait, we need an enchanting table for obsidian?

7770
04:32:47,990 --> 04:32:50,070
Oh yeah, that's true.

7771
04:32:50,490 --> 04:32:50,510
Yeah.

7772
04:32:51,450 --> 04:32:52,710
I should listen to you.

7773
04:32:53,510 --> 04:32:55,330
Listening to chat was a good idea.

7774
04:32:55,570 --> 04:32:56,830
I can't English anymore.

7775
04:32:56,830 --> 04:33:01,330
Every single enderman I've killed has not dropped anything!

7776
04:33:02,330 --> 04:33:03,590
I can't English anymore.

7777
04:33:04,050 --> 04:33:07,030
My mind is mush right now.

7778
04:33:09,650 --> 04:33:10,930
Alright, picky.

7779
04:33:11,510 --> 04:33:12,690
It's time to let's go gambling!

7780
04:33:13,990 --> 04:33:15,150
Let's go gambling!

7781
04:33:16,770 --> 04:33:18,250
I don't know where it's at.

7782
04:33:19,490 --> 04:33:20,390
Let's go gambling!

7783
04:33:20,850 --> 04:33:21,690
Where, where, where?

7784
04:33:23,450 --> 04:33:24,870
Don't do this to me.

7785
04:33:25,990 --> 04:33:27,350
Why are you still pondering?

7786
04:33:27,550 --> 04:33:28,850
Oh my God, he's right there!

7787
04:33:28,910 --> 04:33:29,630
Are you kidding me?

7788
04:33:31,350 --> 04:33:32,450
Grab the gold.

7789
04:33:33,110 --> 04:33:34,230
Oh, what the fuck?

7790
04:33:34,330 --> 04:33:38,530
Oh my God, he just fucking keeled over in front of me.

7791
04:33:38,990 --> 04:33:39,990
I kill him.

7792
04:33:39,990 --> 04:33:40,510
Dang it.

7793
04:33:42,610 --> 04:33:43,950
Oh, I got a tear.

7794
04:33:45,930 --> 04:33:48,150
I don't think so, do we guys?

7795
04:33:50,030 --> 04:33:51,090
Another guy?

7796
04:33:51,610 --> 04:33:54,370
I hate...

7797
04:33:54,370 --> 04:33:55,990
I hate...

7798
04:33:56,890 --> 04:33:57,310
Ghasts.

7799
04:33:57,670 --> 04:33:58,590
I hate them.

7800
04:33:59,770 --> 04:34:00,490
Where'd that guy go?

7801
04:34:00,490 --> 04:34:01,150
Goodbye.

7802
04:34:01,470 --> 04:34:04,090
He gave me two stacks of gravel?

7803
04:34:04,450 --> 04:34:05,910
That fucking bitch.

7804
04:34:06,630 --> 04:34:08,970
He sucks, he sucks.

7805
04:34:13,810 --> 04:34:15,310
Oh, I'm out of space.

7806
04:34:15,710 --> 04:34:16,490
Oh, okay.

7807
04:34:16,870 --> 04:34:17,290
There we go.

7808
04:34:18,430 --> 04:34:20,650
What if I just take this gold in front of you?

7809
04:34:21,470 --> 04:34:22,470
Oh, come here, come here, come here.

7810
04:34:23,610 --> 04:34:26,990
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

7811
04:34:27,190 --> 04:34:28,770
Oh my God, you do get mad.

7812
04:34:28,770 --> 04:34:31,670
You do get mad when you take gold in front of them.

7813
04:34:31,690 --> 04:34:32,790
I told you!

7814
04:34:33,350 --> 04:34:35,690
I know, but I didn't believe you!

7815
04:34:35,730 --> 04:34:38,090
Oh my God, they're all gonna keep attacking us now.

7816
04:34:38,890 --> 04:34:39,290
No!

7817
04:34:41,010 --> 04:34:42,510
Just this one guy.

7818
04:34:43,950 --> 04:34:47,350
I think if you kill them in front, or not in front of other guys, then they don't notice.

7819
04:34:47,350 --> 04:34:48,770
No, I didn't touch him, I didn't touch him.

7820
04:34:48,830 --> 04:34:49,350
Okay, okay.

7821
04:34:49,470 --> 04:34:50,130
We should be good then.

7822
04:34:51,410 --> 04:34:54,130
I called your bluff and I was wrong.

7823
04:34:55,490 --> 04:34:56,670
Why would I be wrong?

7824
04:34:57,190 --> 04:34:58,390
I don't know.

7825
04:34:59,210 --> 04:35:00,710
Sometimes you're wrong.

7826
04:35:01,050 --> 04:35:02,070
Yeah, I'm never wrong.

7827
04:35:02,750 --> 04:35:04,050
Oh, that's a lie right there.

7828
04:35:07,430 --> 04:35:09,110
Oh wait, these are the wrong ones.

7829
04:35:09,250 --> 04:35:10,650
Okay, I need...

7830
04:35:10,650 --> 04:35:11,270
It's these guys?

7831
04:35:11,770 --> 04:35:13,930
Actually, it doesn't hurt to have more of them, I suppose.

7832
04:35:14,610 --> 04:35:16,150
Let's go gambling!

7833
04:35:16,490 --> 04:35:17,330
Let's go gambling!

7834
04:35:17,950 --> 04:35:19,570
Let's go gambling!

7835
04:35:21,530 --> 04:35:25,190
Okay, I'm gonna give it to that one guy that didn't like me.

7836
04:35:25,190 --> 04:35:27,350
Because I'm gonna bribe him, so he'll like me.

7837
04:35:27,590 --> 04:35:27,910
Yeah, yeah.

7838
04:35:28,590 --> 04:35:29,490
Alright, here you go.

7839
04:35:29,590 --> 04:35:30,530
Do you like me now?

7840
04:35:32,350 --> 04:35:33,570
See, he likes me now.

7841
04:35:33,590 --> 04:35:34,610
I see a magma cube!

7842
04:35:37,910 --> 04:35:39,590
If I can get down there...

7843
04:35:39,590 --> 04:35:39,990
Hey, come here.

7844
04:35:40,110 --> 04:35:41,410
Oh no, he stopped...

7845
04:35:41,410 --> 04:35:43,690
Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

7846
04:35:43,810 --> 04:35:44,770
I didn't know!

7847
04:35:45,170 --> 04:35:48,210
I knew, I did it again, I did it again, I did it again!

7848
04:35:48,290 --> 04:35:49,490
What the hell?!

7849
04:35:49,490 --> 04:35:50,410
I went gambling!

7850
04:35:52,470 --> 04:35:53,810
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7851
04:35:54,550 --> 04:35:55,750
Gambling with your life...

7852
04:35:55,750 --> 04:35:56,770
Oh, I got an ender pearl!

7853
04:35:57,690 --> 04:35:57,910
Yay!

7854
04:35:59,990 --> 04:36:01,630
I don't know why I keep gambling.

7855
04:36:02,310 --> 04:36:03,350
I have a problem.

7856
04:36:03,650 --> 04:36:04,950
You're addicted to the thrill.

7857
04:36:05,730 --> 04:36:09,170
Okay, there's a bunch of little endermen around here now, so...

7858
04:36:09,670 --> 04:36:11,190
I'll keep getting them.

7859
04:36:11,370 --> 04:36:13,130
Yeah, yeah, while you keep doing that, I'm gonna keep gambling.

7860
04:36:13,430 --> 04:36:14,770
Okay, I have some more gold.

7861
04:36:14,950 --> 04:36:16,070
I have a problem now.

7862
04:36:19,510 --> 04:36:20,630
I have enough.

7863
04:36:22,350 --> 04:36:23,330
Come here, come here.

7864
04:36:23,470 --> 04:36:23,750
You too.

7865
04:36:24,130 --> 04:36:24,610
Yeah, yeah.

7866
04:36:24,750 --> 04:36:25,210
Both of you.

7867
04:36:26,630 --> 04:36:27,530
Oh no!

7868
04:36:29,570 --> 04:36:30,550
Wait, what happened?

7869
04:36:30,890 --> 04:36:35,150
I knocked the enderman off the side and I think you fell into the lava.

7870
04:36:35,910 --> 04:36:36,590
You did this.

7871
04:36:36,670 --> 04:36:38,170
You killed somebody today.

7872
04:36:38,570 --> 04:36:39,830
Wait, it says enderman screams.

7873
04:36:39,950 --> 04:36:40,950
He's still around somewhere.

7874
04:36:42,270 --> 04:36:42,630
Enderman?

7875
04:36:44,810 --> 04:36:45,850
Let's go gambling!

7876
04:36:46,410 --> 04:36:46,890
Enderman?

7877
04:36:48,010 --> 04:36:48,710
Let's go gambling.

7878
04:36:49,070 --> 04:36:50,650
Oh, he's down there yelling at me.

7879
04:36:51,290 --> 04:36:51,850
Oh my god.

7880
04:36:52,970 --> 04:36:53,470
He's alive.

7881
04:36:53,770 --> 04:36:54,310
He's alive.

7882
04:36:54,930 --> 04:36:56,550
He knows what you did last summer.

7883
04:37:01,930 --> 04:37:03,830
Come on, what else do you have?

7884
04:37:04,670 --> 04:37:05,330
What do I have?

7885
04:37:05,390 --> 04:37:07,230
Oh, it teleports before it hits lava.

7886
04:37:08,110 --> 04:37:08,890
Oh, okay.

7887
04:37:09,430 --> 04:37:10,190
Alright, well, come here.

7888
04:37:11,290 --> 04:37:12,830
I want more gold piece.

7889
04:37:13,570 --> 04:37:15,050
Come on, I know you're rich.

7890
04:37:15,170 --> 04:37:16,310
I see what you're wearing.

7891
04:37:16,610 --> 04:37:18,210
I know you have the money.

7892
04:37:19,090 --> 04:37:21,630
Don't be... Don't be holding out on me.

7893
04:37:22,110 --> 04:37:23,770
Goddammit, he gave me fucking leather.

7894
04:37:24,390 --> 04:37:25,370
He held out on me.

7895
04:37:25,470 --> 04:37:27,090
Both of our gotcha luck is so bad.

7896
04:37:27,430 --> 04:37:28,390
Mine is usually this bad.

7897
04:37:28,410 --> 04:37:31,530
Well, I did get fire... Well, I did get fire resistance, so...

7898
04:37:31,530 --> 04:37:32,190
I don't know.

7899
04:37:32,610 --> 04:37:34,030
I got one pearl.

7900
04:37:34,250 --> 04:37:35,190
Here, I'm gonna give it to you.

7901
04:37:36,390 --> 04:37:37,350
Hold on to it.

7902
04:37:37,950 --> 04:37:38,450
Where are you?

7903
04:37:38,710 --> 04:37:40,130
Okay, we have five now.

7904
04:37:40,570 --> 04:37:40,850
Yeah.

7905
04:37:42,070 --> 04:37:43,450
Five out of how many?

7906
04:37:45,110 --> 04:37:46,510
And here is more gold.

7907
04:37:47,130 --> 04:37:48,570
Oh, we don't need books.

7908
04:37:49,170 --> 04:37:52,550
Guys, we can just get it by farming the...

7909
04:37:52,550 --> 04:37:53,690
the fortress.

7910
04:37:54,190 --> 04:37:55,390
The big fortress.

7911
04:37:55,750 --> 04:37:56,750
What are you talking about?

7912
04:37:57,490 --> 04:38:00,790
They're saying we need books for enchanting table, but we don't need it.

7913
04:38:00,910 --> 04:38:02,330
Yes, actually, we kind of do.

7914
04:38:02,930 --> 04:38:04,950
Okay, well, I dropped like seven stacks of...

7915
04:38:05,410 --> 04:38:07,210
I think like a stack of leather.

7916
04:38:08,510 --> 04:38:08,790
Whatever.

7917
04:38:09,290 --> 04:38:10,570
Into the flames.

7918
04:38:10,890 --> 04:38:12,050
So, we don't anymore.

7919
04:38:12,650 --> 04:38:14,790
We don't need them anymore.

7920
04:38:14,970 --> 04:38:15,710
I got another enderman.

7921
04:38:16,270 --> 04:38:17,030
I baited you.

7922
04:38:17,350 --> 04:38:18,910
I baited you into my trap.

7923
04:38:19,230 --> 04:38:19,570
Oh my god.

7924
04:38:19,710 --> 04:38:20,410
Why did you have to fall?

7925
04:38:21,570 --> 04:38:22,390
Oh my god.

7926
04:38:22,490 --> 04:38:23,510
Goodbye, soul sand.

7927
04:38:24,310 --> 04:38:25,590
Goodbye, soul sand.

7928
04:38:25,650 --> 04:38:26,630
I don't need you.

7929
04:38:28,950 --> 04:38:29,830
Stronghold library?

7930
04:38:30,030 --> 04:38:31,010
Oh yeah, well...

7931
04:38:31,010 --> 04:38:32,090
Yeah, that's what I mean.

7932
04:38:32,190 --> 04:38:32,750
That's what I mean.

7933
04:38:32,810 --> 04:38:33,610
We'll make strong...

7934
04:38:33,610 --> 04:38:35,330
We'll get the books from the stronghold.

7935
04:38:35,630 --> 04:38:36,790
True, true, true.

7936
04:38:36,790 --> 04:38:38,930
We don't need the leather for it.

7937
04:38:39,190 --> 04:38:40,270
Strongholds are not scary.

7938
04:38:40,590 --> 04:38:41,890
How long is your potion for?

7939
04:38:42,650 --> 04:38:43,430
Three minutes.

7940
04:38:44,290 --> 04:38:44,570
Okay.

7941
04:38:45,470 --> 04:38:46,590
That should be enough.

7942
04:38:47,050 --> 04:38:48,450
Well, we still need...

7943
04:38:48,450 --> 04:38:51,330
What do we need for the slow falling, everybody?

7944
04:38:52,070 --> 04:38:53,850
What do we need for the slow falling?

7945
04:38:58,440 --> 04:38:59,740
Oh, that guy disappeared.

7946
04:38:59,960 --> 04:39:00,400
For real.

7947
04:39:00,580 --> 04:39:01,180
What happened to him?

7948
04:39:02,880 --> 04:39:04,580
He gave me another bricks again.

7949
04:39:06,080 --> 04:39:07,040
Oh, phantom!

7950
04:39:07,040 --> 04:39:07,440
Phantom!

7951
04:39:07,820 --> 04:39:10,100
Okay, so we have to not sleep, okay.

7952
04:39:10,500 --> 04:39:11,060
Oh, okay.

7953
04:39:11,260 --> 04:39:11,740
That's fine.

7954
04:39:12,240 --> 04:39:13,080
Yeah, that's fine.

7955
04:39:13,760 --> 04:39:15,500
And we stay up for the endermen too.

7956
04:39:15,820 --> 04:39:17,600
Maybe we'll buy more endermen.

7957
04:39:17,860 --> 04:39:18,440
Maybe, yeah.

7958
04:39:18,700 --> 04:39:21,820
Or we die by skelly or creeper or...

7959
04:39:21,820 --> 04:39:23,020
There's no way we die.

7960
04:39:23,220 --> 04:39:24,040
We have like...

7961
04:39:24,580 --> 04:39:25,220
We have...

7962
04:39:25,220 --> 04:39:26,480
We're full diamond...

7963
04:39:26,480 --> 04:39:27,060
Oh my god.

7964
04:39:27,280 --> 04:39:28,260
We're full diamond...

7965
04:39:28,260 --> 04:39:29,440
I'm sorry, my brain is not working.

7966
04:39:29,840 --> 04:39:30,780
We're full diamond armor.

7967
04:39:31,660 --> 04:39:32,000
You okay?

7968
04:39:32,820 --> 04:39:34,820
You're losing it, you're losing it.

7969
04:39:34,840 --> 04:39:35,360
I'm not losing it.

7970
04:39:35,440 --> 04:39:36,600
You're really losing it.

7971
04:39:36,600 --> 04:39:38,260
I'm fucking losing it.

7972
04:39:38,260 --> 04:39:39,580
I'm gonna jump into the lava.

7973
04:39:39,840 --> 04:39:40,780
Someone stop me.

7974
04:39:40,820 --> 04:39:42,040
I'm fucking heading straight to the lava.

7975
04:39:42,180 --> 04:39:42,480
I'm gonna take the jump.

7976
04:39:42,480 --> 04:39:43,220
Don't do it!

7977
04:39:43,340 --> 04:39:44,440
I'm gonna take the jump!

7978
04:39:44,620 --> 04:39:45,860
I'm gonna take the jump!

7979
04:39:45,940 --> 04:39:46,520
Don't do it!

7980
04:39:46,660 --> 04:39:47,820
I'm fighting endermen!

7981
04:39:48,280 --> 04:39:48,900
For us!

7982
04:39:56,100 --> 04:39:59,780
Why can't I get any pearls?

7983
04:40:00,580 --> 04:40:01,880
How do we get home?

7984
04:40:02,260 --> 04:40:02,980
Pearls here.

7985
04:40:05,660 --> 04:40:07,340
Guys, why is my luck so bad?

7986
04:40:09,120 --> 04:40:10,340
This is why I don't gamble.

7987
04:40:11,200 --> 04:40:12,260
Let's go gambling.

7988
04:40:14,380 --> 04:40:16,280
Doki, it's been four...

7989
04:40:16,280 --> 04:40:17,200
Oh, okay, five hours.

7990
04:40:17,320 --> 04:40:18,020
But, like, come on.

7991
04:40:18,620 --> 04:40:21,380
That's five hours too many for Minecraft, that's...

7992
04:40:27,140 --> 04:40:28,340
What do you want me to do?

7993
04:40:28,380 --> 04:40:29,560
I'm waiting for you right now.

7994
04:40:29,560 --> 04:40:32,840
I'm waiting for this enderman to come get me.

7995
04:40:33,020 --> 04:40:34,240
Alright, I'm heading over.

7996
04:40:34,600 --> 04:40:35,380
I'll fucking...

7997
04:40:35,380 --> 04:40:36,620
I'll help you.

7998
04:40:37,160 --> 04:40:39,780
All in all, this isn't the worst spawn, I suppose.

7999
04:40:40,300 --> 04:40:41,240
Okay, come up here, buddy.

8000
04:40:41,960 --> 04:40:42,680
Come up here.

8001
04:40:43,440 --> 04:40:44,080
He's like...

8002
04:40:44,080 --> 04:40:45,300
He's fallen.

8003
04:40:46,800 --> 04:40:47,760
Where is he?

8004
04:40:48,040 --> 04:40:48,880
He's down there.

8005
04:40:49,340 --> 04:40:50,280
What are you looking at?

8006
04:40:50,380 --> 04:40:51,360
He's down here.

8007
04:40:51,920 --> 04:40:52,520
Where?

8008
04:40:53,100 --> 04:40:54,340
Literally down here.

8009
04:40:55,540 --> 04:40:56,760
Oh my god.

8010
04:40:57,260 --> 04:41:01,520
I swear, if he comes back up and he fucking smacks me into this lava pool...

8011
04:41:01,520 --> 04:41:02,920
No, he's aggroed on me.

8012
04:41:03,660 --> 04:41:05,100
I'm looking at him too.

8013
04:41:07,460 --> 04:41:08,520
Just use your arrow.

8014
04:41:09,360 --> 04:41:10,160
He'll dodge it.

8015
04:41:10,540 --> 04:41:12,540
You can't shoot an enderman with an arrow.

8016
04:41:12,900 --> 04:41:14,100
I'm not gonna waste my arrow.

8017
04:41:14,660 --> 04:41:15,020
You don't know that.

8018
04:41:15,020 --> 04:41:15,480
You don't know that.

8019
04:41:15,480 --> 04:41:16,440
How do you know that?

8020
04:41:16,680 --> 04:41:17,540
How do you know that?

8021
04:41:17,660 --> 04:41:18,440
How do you know that?

8022
04:41:18,520 --> 04:41:19,340
I've done it before.

8023
04:41:20,220 --> 04:41:20,920
Yeah, maybe...

8024
04:41:20,920 --> 04:41:22,240
Maybe it's just that one guy.

8025
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:24,840
That guy was, like, super good.

8026
04:41:24,840 --> 04:41:25,540
He'll dodge and TP up.

8027
04:41:25,560 --> 04:41:26,900
He'll dodge and TP up.

8028
04:41:27,820 --> 04:41:28,220
Do it.

8029
04:41:28,740 --> 04:41:29,060
Wait, what?

8030
04:41:29,060 --> 04:41:29,660
He'll TP up.

8031
04:41:29,980 --> 04:41:30,220
Yeah.

8032
04:41:30,880 --> 04:41:31,260
What?

8033
04:41:31,500 --> 04:41:31,820
Up?

8034
04:41:32,140 --> 04:41:33,780
Yeah, he'll dodge, but he'll TP.

8035
04:41:36,020 --> 04:41:38,420
But it's a waste of a spectral arrow.

8036
04:41:38,740 --> 04:41:39,440
Oh, there he is.

8037
04:41:39,480 --> 04:41:39,760
Nevermind.

8038
04:41:39,760 --> 04:41:40,660
We didn't have to do it.

8039
04:41:40,820 --> 04:41:40,840
There he is.

8040
04:41:41,080 --> 04:41:41,480
Ouch!

8041
04:41:41,580 --> 04:41:42,100
Stop!

8042
04:41:43,560 --> 04:41:45,360
You were hitting me instead!

8043
04:41:45,720 --> 04:41:46,240
No, I didn't!

8044
04:41:46,260 --> 04:41:47,180
Yes, you were!

8045
04:41:48,140 --> 04:41:50,180
You were hitting me instead!

8046
04:41:50,240 --> 04:41:52,040
It was the ender...

8047
04:41:52,040 --> 04:41:53,880
It was the enderman!

8048
04:41:54,900 --> 04:41:55,640
It was the end...

8049
04:41:55,640 --> 04:41:56,220
I literally...

8050
04:41:56,220 --> 04:41:57,740
My thing was on the enderman right here.

8051
04:41:57,800 --> 04:41:58,180
This is what I did.

8052
04:41:58,260 --> 04:41:58,980
I was like...

8053
04:41:59,860 --> 04:42:00,820
That wasn't me.

8054
04:42:00,880 --> 04:42:01,600
That was not me.

8055
04:42:01,620 --> 04:42:02,420
I don't think so.

8056
04:42:02,720 --> 04:42:03,420
That wasn't me.

8057
04:42:03,780 --> 04:42:04,580
That wasn't me.

8058
04:42:04,740 --> 04:42:04,980
Alright.

8059
04:42:05,600 --> 04:42:06,260
Pull up the VOD!

8060
04:42:06,440 --> 04:42:07,400
Pull up the VOD!

8061
04:42:09,960 --> 04:42:11,460
We need the receipts!

8062
04:42:11,900 --> 04:42:14,960
After this stream is over, pull up the receipts right now!

8063
04:42:15,280 --> 04:42:16,620
Timestamp this moment!

8064
04:42:16,980 --> 04:42:18,000
Timestamp this moment!

8065
04:42:18,520 --> 04:42:19,400
Timestamp this moment!

8066
04:42:19,420 --> 04:42:19,680
Timestamp this moment!

8067
04:42:19,720 --> 04:42:20,640
Timestamp this moment!

8068
04:42:20,980 --> 04:42:21,220
And we'll know...

8069
04:42:22,040 --> 04:42:23,800
We'll know in 12 more hours.

8070
04:42:24,040 --> 04:42:31,800
We'll know in 12 hours if that happened.

8071
04:42:35,560 --> 04:42:36,720
It's gotta be...

8072
04:42:36,720 --> 04:42:37,260
Okay, be careful.

8073
04:42:37,360 --> 04:42:37,900
Don't go that way.

8074
04:42:38,520 --> 04:42:39,780
It's gotta be this way.

8075
04:42:42,700 --> 04:42:43,180
Because...

8076
04:42:43,180 --> 04:42:45,120
We didn't go to the crimson forest.

8077
04:42:45,140 --> 04:42:46,400
We came from the side.

8078
04:42:46,820 --> 04:42:47,140
Yeah.

8079
04:42:48,320 --> 04:42:50,200
Do you remember which side it was?

8080
04:42:50,300 --> 04:42:51,160
Because I don't.

8081
04:42:52,040 --> 04:42:53,920
I have the coordinates in case we need it.

8082
04:42:54,520 --> 04:42:56,980
I think this is the moment where we need it.

8083
04:42:57,000 --> 04:42:57,560
No, no, I know.

8084
04:42:57,780 --> 04:42:59,500
I remember that sand over there.

8085
04:43:00,720 --> 04:43:03,900
Why don't we not put any torches to tell us where we went?

8086
04:43:04,160 --> 04:43:06,440
I did a little over...

8087
04:43:06,440 --> 04:43:07,180
Over there.

8088
04:43:07,840 --> 04:43:08,320
Uh-oh.

8089
04:43:08,540 --> 04:43:09,260
There's a gas.

8090
04:43:09,360 --> 04:43:09,780
Be careful.

8091
04:43:11,020 --> 04:43:11,480
There's a gas.

8092
04:43:11,920 --> 04:43:13,620
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

8093
04:43:15,040 --> 04:43:16,160
No, don't say that.

8094
04:43:16,240 --> 04:43:17,140
Now I'm freaking out.

8095
04:43:17,220 --> 04:43:18,060
Now I'm panicking.

8096
04:43:18,260 --> 04:43:19,220
Oh my god, he can see me.

8097
04:43:19,840 --> 04:43:22,060
Now I'm panicking, Min.

8098
04:43:22,080 --> 04:43:23,700
I'm panicking right now.

8099
04:43:23,760 --> 04:43:24,180
Oh my god.

8100
04:43:24,400 --> 04:43:25,340
I'm freaking out.

8101
04:43:25,340 --> 04:43:26,200
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

8102
04:43:26,780 --> 04:43:28,820
I'm freaking out right now, Min.

8103
04:43:28,940 --> 04:43:29,680
I don't know.

8104
04:43:29,880 --> 04:43:30,160
I'm freaking out.

8105
04:43:30,160 --> 04:43:31,300
He's aggroed on me.

8106
04:43:31,420 --> 04:43:32,900
You have no reason to freak out.

8107
04:43:35,660 --> 04:43:37,540
What if he looks at me?

8108
04:43:38,840 --> 04:43:40,280
Okay, I think he despawned.

8109
04:43:41,100 --> 04:43:42,100
Yeah, he definitely did.

8110
04:43:42,160 --> 04:43:43,580
He just disappeared on my screen.

8111
04:43:43,880 --> 04:43:44,160
Okay, cool.

8112
04:43:45,800 --> 04:43:47,320
Oh shit, where are we?

8113
04:43:50,080 --> 04:43:50,800
Oh no.

8114
04:43:51,240 --> 04:43:52,240
Oh, you have the coordinates.

8115
04:43:54,580 --> 04:43:55,340
I do.

8116
04:43:55,520 --> 04:43:56,940
Okay, I'll get the coordinates.

8117
04:43:57,280 --> 04:43:58,220
Okay, I'll get the coordinates.

8118
04:43:59,480 --> 04:44:01,860
It's on the other side from here, I think.

8119
04:44:03,000 --> 04:44:04,540
Oh yeah, it's over there.

8120
04:44:04,920 --> 04:44:05,840
Yeah, past the lava.

8121
04:44:06,140 --> 04:44:06,680
Yeah, it's past this lava.

8122
04:44:06,960 --> 04:44:07,420
Yeah, yeah.

8123
04:44:07,760 --> 04:44:09,080
Is there any piggies around here?

8124
04:44:09,460 --> 04:44:10,180
It's here, he's here.

8125
04:44:10,180 --> 04:44:11,260
I'm mining, I'm mining.

8126
04:44:12,200 --> 04:44:13,720
I found the hole we made.

8127
04:44:15,100 --> 04:44:16,540
I'm not scouting, by the way.

8128
04:44:16,580 --> 04:44:17,920
I'm literally in our hole.

8129
04:44:20,840 --> 04:44:23,080
Alright, I'm going back to the portal.

8130
04:44:23,500 --> 04:44:23,860
Hold on.

8131
04:44:24,080 --> 04:44:25,380
I'm getting more gold.

8132
04:44:25,640 --> 04:44:26,620
This is for us.

8133
04:44:28,020 --> 04:44:29,460
I'm heading over.

8134
04:44:30,180 --> 04:44:31,420
I only got 17.

8135
04:44:32,820 --> 04:44:34,040
Oh my God, how do we...

8136
04:44:34,040 --> 04:44:35,580
How do we jump down from here?

8137
04:44:36,280 --> 04:44:37,480
How does this work?

8138
04:44:39,240 --> 04:44:40,440
I'm so...

8139
04:44:40,440 --> 04:44:40,940
I'm coming.

8140
04:44:42,960 --> 04:44:44,200
Where's the hole we made?

8141
04:44:44,380 --> 04:44:44,980
There's too many holes.

8142
04:44:46,700 --> 04:44:48,560
There's so many holes.

8143
04:44:51,320 --> 04:44:52,800
Alright, this is the right hole.

8144
04:44:53,060 --> 04:44:53,760
I'm just gonna fall.

8145
04:44:54,160 --> 04:44:55,360
I think I found it.

8146
04:44:58,500 --> 04:45:01,260
If I get out of the nether and like...

8147
04:45:01,260 --> 04:45:02,620
And then I see...

8148
04:45:02,620 --> 04:45:04,260
Made Mint dies.

8149
04:45:04,860 --> 04:45:05,720
Are you out of the nether?

8150
04:45:06,040 --> 04:45:06,540
Are you out?

8151
04:45:06,780 --> 04:45:07,520
Yeah, I'm out.

8152
04:45:07,960 --> 04:45:08,660
Okay, I'm almost there.

8153
04:45:08,660 --> 04:45:10,480
I'm out, but it's night time and I'm gonna sleep.

8154
04:45:10,820 --> 04:45:12,460
Oh, I can't sleep, so...

8155
04:45:12,460 --> 04:45:13,100
Good luck with that.

8156
04:45:13,160 --> 04:45:13,580
You might...

8157
04:45:13,580 --> 04:45:15,340
You actually would be safer probably in here.

8158
04:45:16,060 --> 04:45:16,760
Yeah, that's true.

8159
04:45:16,840 --> 04:45:17,860
Maybe it would be safer.

8160
04:45:18,840 --> 04:45:19,980
Until I'm out.

8161
04:45:21,680 --> 04:45:23,300
Back to the portal I go!

8162
04:45:24,160 --> 04:45:24,860
Oh shit!

8163
04:45:25,060 --> 04:45:25,400
Oh shit!

8164
04:45:25,880 --> 04:45:26,720
Doki doki!

8165
04:45:28,860 --> 04:45:29,620
Where are you?

8166
04:45:29,720 --> 04:45:30,180
I'm okay.

8167
04:45:30,540 --> 04:45:31,280
Where are you?

8168
04:45:31,400 --> 04:45:31,760
I'm okay.

8169
04:45:31,840 --> 04:45:32,360
Everything's fine.

8170
04:45:32,380 --> 04:45:33,060
Where are you?

8171
04:45:33,200 --> 04:45:34,320
Where are you, Mint?

8172
04:45:34,520 --> 04:45:35,240
Everything's fine.

8173
04:45:35,240 --> 04:45:35,580
Where are you, Mint?

8174
04:45:35,980 --> 04:45:36,640
Everything's fine.

8175
04:45:37,220 --> 04:45:39,260
Why does it not sound fine?

8176
04:45:41,560 --> 04:45:42,520
I'm okay.

8177
04:45:42,940 --> 04:45:43,520
I'm okay.

8178
04:45:44,120 --> 04:45:44,600
I'm okay.

8179
04:45:46,560 --> 04:45:47,600
I'm okay.

8180
04:45:47,600 --> 04:45:51,880
Things were not okay for like a good 30 seconds, but I'm okay.

8181
04:45:52,300 --> 04:45:53,260
What happened?

8182
04:45:53,560 --> 04:45:54,220
What happened?

8183
04:45:55,760 --> 04:45:59,940
I was doing my job as the gold collector.

8184
04:46:01,000 --> 04:46:01,240
Yeah?

8185
04:46:01,460 --> 04:46:03,700
Oh, so you were being greedy.

8186
04:46:04,200 --> 04:46:04,840
What the heck?

8187
04:46:04,920 --> 04:46:05,540
What do you mean greedy?

8188
04:46:05,640 --> 04:46:06,660
This is for the gacha.

8189
04:46:07,020 --> 04:46:07,360
You were being greedy.

8190
04:46:07,360 --> 04:46:08,600
This is for the gacha.

8191
04:46:11,140 --> 04:46:12,100
What happened?

8192
04:46:14,680 --> 04:46:15,280
Oh shit.

8193
04:46:15,520 --> 04:46:16,200
I heard that.

8194
04:46:16,620 --> 04:46:17,200
Oh shit.

8195
04:46:18,800 --> 04:46:19,600
Oh shit.

8196
04:46:19,780 --> 04:46:20,200
It's fine.

8197
04:46:20,880 --> 04:46:21,260
Are you okay?

8198
04:46:21,900 --> 04:46:23,120
No, I'm not okay.

8199
04:46:23,240 --> 04:46:24,020
I can't do baseball.

8200
04:46:24,140 --> 04:46:24,940
I can't do baseball.

8201
04:46:25,060 --> 04:46:25,820
I can't do baseball.

8202
04:46:25,900 --> 04:46:27,180
I told you not to try the baseball.

8203
04:46:27,520 --> 04:46:28,700
Where's the...

8204
04:46:28,700 --> 04:46:29,600
Is that the portal over there?

8205
04:46:29,680 --> 04:46:29,940
Oh, I see it.

8206
04:46:30,720 --> 04:46:32,360
I thought it'd be...

8207
04:46:32,360 --> 04:46:32,820
Bam!

8208
04:46:32,920 --> 04:46:33,080
No!

8209
04:46:33,220 --> 04:46:34,220
How did I miss?

8210
04:46:35,880 --> 04:46:36,980
I'm gonna try for this one.

8211
04:46:37,000 --> 04:46:37,020
Bam!

8212
04:46:37,180 --> 04:46:37,380
What?

8213
04:46:40,160 --> 04:46:40,560
How?

8214
04:46:40,800 --> 04:46:41,200
How?

8215
04:46:41,460 --> 04:46:41,680
Oh!

8216
04:46:41,680 --> 04:46:44,410
He got his ball!

8217
04:46:44,530 --> 04:46:45,170
He got his ball!

8218
04:46:45,250 --> 04:46:45,890
He got his ball!

8219
04:46:46,010 --> 04:46:46,450
He got it!

8220
04:46:46,950 --> 04:46:47,910
Go, go, go!

8221
04:46:50,050 --> 04:46:50,630
It's okay.

8222
04:46:50,650 --> 04:46:51,030
I'm okay.

8223
04:46:51,170 --> 04:46:52,050
Nothing bad happened.

8224
04:46:54,470 --> 04:46:56,150
That was literally what happened to me.

8225
04:46:58,610 --> 04:47:00,250
I'm not playing baseball again.

8226
04:47:00,590 --> 04:47:00,950
I'm not.

8227
04:47:01,030 --> 04:47:01,290
See?

8228
04:47:01,430 --> 04:47:03,870
Oh, so you got greedy with the baseball.

8229
04:47:07,110 --> 04:47:09,630
You got greedy trying to play baseball.

8230
04:47:10,630 --> 04:47:11,570
How do I get over...

8231
04:47:11,570 --> 04:47:12,750
Oh, I'm on the wrong side.

8232
04:47:13,530 --> 04:47:14,750
Are you still not here?

8233
04:47:15,130 --> 04:47:15,510
I'm over...

8234
04:47:15,510 --> 04:47:18,530
I literally saw you bouncing around.

8235
04:47:19,850 --> 04:47:20,450
Is it...

8236
04:47:20,450 --> 04:47:20,790
Oh, shit.

8237
04:47:23,230 --> 04:47:23,890
He's on you.

8238
04:47:24,230 --> 04:47:25,170
Oh, thank God.

8239
04:47:25,350 --> 04:47:25,890
Oh, thank God.

8240
04:47:25,950 --> 04:47:27,210
I had PTSD right there.

8241
04:47:30,990 --> 04:47:31,630
Oh my God.

8242
04:47:31,930 --> 04:47:33,210
I might die.

8243
04:47:33,650 --> 04:47:34,330
I might die.

8244
04:47:35,090 --> 04:47:35,910
Or maybe not.

8245
04:47:36,610 --> 04:47:37,250
Maybe not.

8246
04:47:37,770 --> 04:47:38,770
Oh, he's still on me.

8247
04:47:38,810 --> 04:47:39,450
He's still on me.

8248
04:47:39,730 --> 04:47:40,230
Where is he?

8249
04:47:40,270 --> 04:47:40,730
Where is he?

8250
04:47:40,810 --> 04:47:41,710
I can't get him!

8251
04:47:41,710 --> 04:47:43,170
All I have is this sword!

8252
04:47:43,370 --> 04:47:43,670
I know.

8253
04:47:45,050 --> 04:47:46,990
Try to aggro him and I'll try to shoot him.

8254
04:47:47,130 --> 04:47:47,770
I'm looking at him.

8255
04:47:47,830 --> 04:47:49,750
I'm literally looking at him and he's not looking back.

8256
04:47:49,850 --> 04:47:51,530
That's not how it works.

8257
04:47:52,110 --> 04:47:52,810
He's not an Enderman.

8258
04:47:52,830 --> 04:47:54,370
How do I aggro him?

8259
04:47:54,430 --> 04:47:54,970
I don't know!

8260
04:47:56,450 --> 04:47:58,690
Okay, he's not looking at either of us now.

8261
04:47:58,730 --> 04:47:59,590
He's just chilling.

8262
04:48:00,250 --> 04:48:00,890
It doesn't matter.

8263
04:48:01,190 --> 04:48:01,770
He's just waving his little feetsies.

8264
04:48:01,770 --> 04:48:02,710
It doesn't matter.

8265
04:48:03,130 --> 04:48:04,590
He's waving his feetsies.

8266
04:48:04,670 --> 04:48:05,690
Where are you?

8267
04:48:06,550 --> 04:48:07,730
I like your arrow.

8268
04:48:08,070 --> 04:48:08,770
I took one of it.

8269
04:48:09,410 --> 04:48:09,810
You did?

8270
04:48:09,810 --> 04:48:11,150
Why am I...

8271
04:48:11,150 --> 04:48:12,330
What the fuck am I missing, man?

8272
04:48:12,730 --> 04:48:13,650
Okay, I'm running.

8273
04:48:14,250 --> 04:48:14,970
I'm coming over.

8274
04:48:15,330 --> 04:48:15,630
Yeah, yeah.

8275
04:48:15,710 --> 04:48:16,430
No, come over here.

8276
04:48:16,510 --> 04:48:17,830
Come over here right now.

8277
04:48:18,230 --> 04:48:19,570
We're not fucking around no more.

8278
04:48:20,630 --> 04:48:22,310
We're not fucking around.

8279
04:48:24,930 --> 04:48:25,410
Alright.

8280
04:48:25,690 --> 04:48:25,950
Is it daytime?

8281
04:48:26,530 --> 04:48:27,090
It's nighttime.

8282
04:48:27,670 --> 04:48:27,990
Okay.

8283
04:48:28,550 --> 04:48:29,390
We'll just...

8284
04:48:29,390 --> 04:48:31,490
He's like right behind us, by the way.

8285
04:48:31,670 --> 04:48:32,770
He's literally right there.

8286
04:48:33,270 --> 04:48:33,990
The gas.

8287
04:48:34,350 --> 04:48:35,970
Oh, I'm out of the nether.

8288
04:48:37,330 --> 04:48:38,150
I'm out too.

8289
04:48:38,310 --> 04:48:38,950
Okay, I'm sleeping.

8290
04:48:38,950 --> 04:48:40,770
I mean, we want it to be night anyway, right?

8291
04:48:41,350 --> 04:48:42,610
Oh, well...

8292
04:48:42,610 --> 04:48:43,510
For the phantoms, right?

8293
04:48:44,330 --> 04:48:48,510
Yeah, but ideally, we would have like a place to, you know, be safe at.

8294
04:48:49,110 --> 04:48:50,850
Like, there's skellies everywhere.

8295
04:48:51,370 --> 04:48:52,770
Alright, pussy, let's do it.

8296
04:48:56,270 --> 04:48:56,710
Alright.

8297
04:48:59,330 --> 04:48:59,790
Good morning.

8298
04:49:00,050 --> 04:49:01,990
Someone's a coward, so...

8299
04:49:04,290 --> 04:49:05,750
Someone's a little coward.

8300
04:49:06,110 --> 04:49:06,970
Do you guys hear this?

8301
04:49:07,050 --> 04:49:07,350
That's all I'm saying.

8302
04:49:07,910 --> 04:49:08,950
Do you guys hear this?

8303
04:49:09,030 --> 04:49:09,630
As she was like...

8304
04:49:09,630 --> 04:49:09,930
Okay, we gotta do a marker.

8305
04:49:12,390 --> 04:49:13,890
I don't know what you're talking about.

8306
04:49:13,910 --> 04:49:15,310
Okay, we'll make a peepee tower here.

8307
04:49:15,430 --> 04:49:15,670
Okay.

8308
04:49:16,270 --> 04:49:17,410
So we'll remember...

8309
04:49:17,410 --> 04:49:17,990
We have to...

8310
04:49:17,990 --> 04:49:19,870
Okay, mark this coordinate, because we have to come back here.

8311
04:49:21,790 --> 04:49:22,590
You mark it.

8312
04:49:23,410 --> 04:49:23,750
What?

8313
04:49:24,270 --> 04:49:24,670
You...

8314
04:49:24,670 --> 04:49:25,190
Okay, I won't...

8315
04:49:25,190 --> 04:49:25,970
Chat, mark it.

8316
04:49:26,150 --> 04:49:26,710
Oh my god.

8317
04:49:27,610 --> 04:49:28,370
Okay, I marked it.

8318
04:49:28,530 --> 04:49:29,030
I marked it.

8319
04:49:29,230 --> 04:49:30,890
I marked it.

8320
04:49:36,750 --> 04:49:38,490
Why didn't you jump into the water?

8321
04:49:39,230 --> 04:49:40,030
I'm scared.

8322
04:49:41,390 --> 04:49:41,910
Okay.

8323
04:49:43,190 --> 04:49:44,590
Who's the baby now?

8324
04:49:45,350 --> 04:49:46,250
What am I...

8325
04:49:46,250 --> 04:49:47,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

8326
04:49:47,330 --> 04:49:50,170
I just didn't want to fucking die by fall damage.

8327
04:49:50,470 --> 04:49:57,070
That's even labor than wanting to not die by skeleton and creeper and enderman and literally everything.

8328
04:49:57,210 --> 04:49:58,610
Witches that come after us.

8329
04:49:58,770 --> 04:50:00,570
Literally, majority of our deaths was from fall damage.

8330
04:50:00,710 --> 04:50:02,290
Literally, that's the majority of our deaths.

8331
04:50:02,690 --> 04:50:03,210
Majority?

8332
04:50:03,410 --> 04:50:04,610
That's just you.

8333
04:50:05,350 --> 04:50:06,890
No, no, no, no.

8334
04:50:07,230 --> 04:50:07,770
No, no.

8335
04:50:07,990 --> 04:50:09,470
Our deaths, guys.

8336
04:50:11,710 --> 04:50:12,510
Majority of...

8337
04:50:12,510 --> 04:50:13,710
Wait, where are we trying to find again?

8338
04:50:13,850 --> 04:50:14,210
I don't know.

8339
04:50:14,230 --> 04:50:14,930
I'm just walking.

8340
04:50:16,250 --> 04:50:18,610
Ideally, we want to find a village.

8341
04:50:19,470 --> 04:50:20,030
Oh, it's a...

8342
04:50:20,030 --> 04:50:20,510
Wait, for what?

8343
04:50:20,870 --> 04:50:21,270
Armadillo.

8344
04:50:24,030 --> 04:50:25,550
He's so cute, isn't he?

8345
04:50:36,370 --> 04:50:36,770
What?

8346
04:50:37,410 --> 04:50:38,130
You hit me.

8347
04:50:38,770 --> 04:50:39,590
No, I didn't.

8348
04:50:39,670 --> 04:50:40,370
Yes, you did.

8349
04:50:42,830 --> 04:50:43,630
The VOD.

8350
04:50:43,970 --> 04:50:44,530
The VOD.

8351
04:50:45,490 --> 04:50:47,110
Check the VOD in 10 hours.

8352
04:50:53,750 --> 04:50:54,170
What?

8353
04:50:54,170 --> 04:50:55,290
I wish there was one close to you.

8354
04:50:55,290 --> 04:50:56,630
Wait, why do we need to find a village?

8355
04:50:57,030 --> 04:50:57,810
What was the point?

8356
04:50:59,590 --> 04:51:00,010
Well...

8357
04:51:02,270 --> 04:51:02,690
For...

8358
04:51:02,690 --> 04:51:03,010
Yeah?

8359
04:51:03,790 --> 04:51:04,210
Yeah?

8360
04:51:04,930 --> 04:51:05,710
What's it called?

8361
04:51:05,830 --> 04:51:06,950
The brewing thing.

8362
04:51:07,030 --> 04:51:07,990
I don't know how to make it.

8363
04:51:08,630 --> 04:51:10,210
Oh, the brewing sound?

8364
04:51:10,690 --> 04:51:11,650
Yeah, how do we make that?

8365
04:51:11,650 --> 04:51:12,430
Where did you go?

8366
04:51:13,250 --> 04:51:15,030
I'm where the armadillo...

8367
04:51:15,030 --> 04:51:16,070
Oh, you went far.

8368
04:51:16,270 --> 04:51:16,510
Okay.

8369
04:51:16,510 --> 04:51:18,130
Wait, I didn't even go anywhere.

8370
04:51:18,190 --> 04:51:19,250
Why did you...

8371
04:51:19,250 --> 04:51:20,730
Why are you just taking off on your own?

8372
04:51:21,270 --> 04:51:22,710
I thought you were beside me.

8373
04:51:22,770 --> 04:51:23,690
Why aren't you moving?

8374
04:51:24,670 --> 04:51:25,590
I am moving.

8375
04:51:25,670 --> 04:51:26,490
What are you talking about?

8376
04:51:26,710 --> 04:51:28,550
Why were you still at the armadillo place?

8377
04:51:29,150 --> 04:51:29,910
No, I was...

8378
04:51:29,910 --> 04:51:31,450
I was looking at something in my inventory.

8379
04:51:33,030 --> 04:51:34,350
Stone and blaze rod.

8380
04:51:34,950 --> 04:51:35,670
Yeah, see?

8381
04:51:35,810 --> 04:51:38,730
I don't want to waste a blaze rod on the...

8382
04:51:39,150 --> 04:51:40,430
The potion stand.

8383
04:51:40,650 --> 04:51:41,790
Why do we need blaze rods again?

8384
04:51:41,790 --> 04:51:45,690
For the things to activate the...

8385
04:51:45,690 --> 04:51:47,250
The end portal.

8386
04:51:47,590 --> 04:51:50,350
Like, we actually do need them.

8387
04:51:53,450 --> 04:51:54,590
Let's go straight.

8388
04:51:55,650 --> 04:51:56,290
Straight?

8389
04:51:56,970 --> 04:51:57,390
Yeah.

8390
04:51:57,690 --> 04:51:59,010
Here, I'm gonna make a boat.

8391
04:51:59,690 --> 04:51:59,990
Alright.

8392
04:52:05,400 --> 04:52:06,180
Hold on.

8393
04:52:07,220 --> 04:52:08,080
I have crafting table.

8394
04:52:08,380 --> 04:52:09,260
Oh, I just made one.

8395
04:52:09,740 --> 04:52:10,040
Okay.

8396
04:52:10,680 --> 04:52:11,780
Oh, you could have asked.

8397
04:52:12,550 --> 04:52:15,040
You could have spoken up and said you have one.

8398
04:52:15,180 --> 04:52:15,440
You could have asked.

8399
04:52:15,620 --> 04:52:15,960
Come on.

8400
04:52:16,240 --> 04:52:19,140
Oh, you're not gonna bring the crafting table you made?

8401
04:52:19,420 --> 04:52:21,120
No, I'll just make another.

8402
04:52:21,220 --> 04:52:22,460
There's trees everywhere.

8403
04:52:23,760 --> 04:52:25,600
There's trees everywhere.

8404
04:52:25,680 --> 04:52:27,010
Oh yeah, then you're gonna be like...

8405
04:52:27,460 --> 04:52:29,840
Oh, Doki, I broke my pickaxe.

8406
04:52:29,880 --> 04:52:31,700
I need somebody to help me.

8407
04:52:31,760 --> 04:52:33,300
I don't have any wood.

8408
04:52:34,120 --> 04:52:35,260
That's gonna happen.

8409
04:52:35,480 --> 04:52:35,920
Maybe.

8410
04:52:36,400 --> 04:52:38,100
That might happen.

8411
04:52:39,280 --> 04:52:42,040
If that happens, I'll just die and then we'll restart.

8412
04:52:44,500 --> 04:52:50,100
What if we did a run where it was not only hardcore, but you could only make one of...

8413
04:52:51,060 --> 04:52:51,780
What the hell?

8414
04:52:52,080 --> 04:52:52,800
Oh wait, wait.

8415
04:52:53,080 --> 04:52:53,780
Does he have anything?

8416
04:52:54,360 --> 04:52:55,300
Yeah, he might have stuff.

8417
04:52:57,160 --> 04:52:58,620
He might have trading stuff.

8418
04:52:59,280 --> 04:53:00,680
No, he doesn't have anything.

8419
04:53:01,400 --> 04:53:02,920
Oh my god, you're actually worthless.

8420
04:53:05,160 --> 04:53:06,600
They're gonna spit on us now.

8421
04:53:06,600 --> 04:53:07,800
It's fine.

8422
04:53:08,420 --> 04:53:10,300
Now you have no owner.

8423
04:53:10,940 --> 04:53:14,240
Now they'll just die here.

8424
04:53:14,600 --> 04:53:15,740
Yeah, they'll die here.

8425
04:53:16,020 --> 04:53:18,540
Yeah, they're domesticated so they can't live in the wild.

8426
04:53:18,560 --> 04:53:20,740
They're gonna come back like Alan Wake.

8427
04:53:22,140 --> 04:53:23,960
You killed my owner.

8428
04:53:28,240 --> 04:53:30,580
Oh yeah, this is a hidden run.

8429
04:53:30,700 --> 04:53:31,260
That's right.

8430
04:53:31,780 --> 04:53:33,100
What are you gonna do?

8431
04:53:33,180 --> 04:53:34,200
Fucking kill us?

8432
04:53:34,200 --> 04:53:35,540
They could.

8433
04:53:36,080 --> 04:53:38,540
If they really spat enough, maybe.

8434
04:53:39,180 --> 04:53:43,360
Oh, my chat is just so sad, making me so sad right now.

8435
04:53:43,660 --> 04:53:44,180
Wait, why?

8436
04:53:44,560 --> 04:53:46,560
They just keep saying of Hawk Tua.

8437
04:53:48,560 --> 04:53:50,780
Yeah, they said that too and I ignored them.

8438
04:53:50,900 --> 04:53:51,240
I know.

8439
04:53:51,440 --> 04:53:53,260
I'm not here to encourage this behavior.

8440
04:53:53,580 --> 04:53:53,680
I know.

8441
04:53:56,340 --> 04:53:59,040
I don't understand why that meme is so popular.

8442
04:53:59,880 --> 04:54:00,680
I don't either.

8443
04:54:01,080 --> 04:54:03,380
I don't think it's funny.

8444
04:54:03,380 --> 04:54:09,380
I think it's one of those things where it's like easy to get people to say it, you know, like...

8445
04:54:11,180 --> 04:54:17,380
Like, you can kind of like with the mic memes and all, you can get people to say them easily.

8446
04:54:17,380 --> 04:54:18,980
Yeah, but that's clever.

8447
04:54:19,920 --> 04:54:21,380
The other one's not as clever.

8448
04:54:21,720 --> 04:54:22,380
Like, it's just...

8449
04:54:23,100 --> 04:54:23,860
And then, like...

8450
04:54:23,860 --> 04:54:27,980
Okay, like, I admire the girl for milking that shit so hard.

8451
04:54:27,980 --> 04:54:28,240
Oh, my God.

8452
04:54:28,340 --> 04:54:29,780
She went crazy with it.

8453
04:54:29,800 --> 04:54:30,820
She was like...

8454
04:54:30,820 --> 04:54:32,600
There's Halloween costumes.

8455
04:54:32,600 --> 04:54:34,560
I was like, how do you make Halloween...

8456
04:54:34,560 --> 04:54:35,760
You saw the Halloween costume.

8457
04:54:35,860 --> 04:54:38,980
I was like, how the fuck do you make a Halloween costume?

8458
04:54:39,340 --> 04:54:40,060
You don't.

8459
04:54:40,340 --> 04:54:42,880
Yeah, but it's in spirit Halloween.

8460
04:54:43,120 --> 04:54:43,460
I know.

8461
04:54:43,720 --> 04:54:44,840
I saw, like, pictures of it.

8462
04:54:45,100 --> 04:54:46,360
And then there's, like, podcasts.

8463
04:54:46,840 --> 04:54:47,560
There's videos.

8464
04:54:48,200 --> 04:54:49,220
There's, like...

8465
04:54:49,220 --> 04:54:53,760
She got signed a million dollar kick contract and everything.

8466
04:54:53,900 --> 04:54:54,280
What?

8467
04:54:54,820 --> 04:54:58,120
Yeah, she signed a contract to stream exclusively on kick.

8468
04:54:58,120 --> 04:55:00,300
And, like, it was, like, you know...

8469
04:55:00,660 --> 04:55:03,480
A lot of the contracts are a million dollars and stuff.

8470
04:55:03,840 --> 04:55:04,440
And, like...

8471
04:55:05,740 --> 04:55:07,540
She is a business woman.

8472
04:55:07,720 --> 04:55:09,300
Yeah, she's...

8473
04:55:09,980 --> 04:55:11,100
Honestly, if that's...

8474
04:55:11,100 --> 04:55:12,760
I need to know who her agent is.

8475
04:55:15,300 --> 04:55:17,560
I want a Halloween costume at spirit Halloween.

8476
04:55:17,860 --> 04:55:20,540
Yeah, but you have to lose all your dignity to get it.

8477
04:55:21,620 --> 04:55:23,480
Okay, like, not like that, though.

8478
04:55:23,560 --> 04:55:27,080
You have to lose your dignity to gain the spirit Halloween costume.

8479
04:55:28,800 --> 04:55:30,340
Is it worth it?

8480
04:55:30,420 --> 04:55:33,160
I'm gonna email spirit Halloween and be like, hey...

8481
04:55:34,040 --> 04:55:37,240
Do you wanna make me a Halloween costume?

8482
04:55:37,360 --> 04:55:38,840
I'll say something dumb.

8483
04:55:39,760 --> 04:55:41,820
All you have to do is open your mouth, doki.

8484
04:55:43,020 --> 04:55:44,200
That's every day.

8485
04:55:44,400 --> 04:55:45,420
Yeah, it's every day.

8486
04:55:46,080 --> 04:55:49,540
Do you think we'll ever go back to our coordinates or what?

8487
04:55:49,880 --> 04:55:51,400
I have the coordinates, we're fine.

8488
04:55:51,500 --> 04:55:52,940
I didn't get so far.

8489
04:55:55,100 --> 04:55:55,560
Hmm...

8490
04:55:55,560 --> 04:56:00,720
It's a $5,000,000 kick contract, not even a million dollars.

8491
04:56:01,220 --> 04:56:01,940
$5,000,000?

8492
04:56:02,660 --> 04:56:03,680
$5,000,000?

8493
04:56:04,240 --> 04:56:07,000
I've never, like, I've never... I don't think I even...

8494
04:56:07,000 --> 04:56:09,280
Oh, no, I did watch the original video, but...

8495
04:56:09,280 --> 04:56:11,160
No, I watched the original, how she got popular.

8496
04:56:11,320 --> 04:56:14,000
I've never seen anything else about her, like, is she actually funny?

8497
04:56:14,120 --> 04:56:15,500
Like, is the podcast any good?

8498
04:56:15,820 --> 04:56:18,600
I think she's just... she just has a country accent.

8499
04:56:20,920 --> 04:56:22,960
That's when she's like...

8500
04:56:22,960 --> 04:56:23,380
Hey, y'all.

8501
04:56:23,640 --> 04:56:23,840
Like, sorry.

8502
04:56:24,000 --> 04:56:26,900
Yeah, she has, like, a very heavy southern...

8503
04:56:26,900 --> 04:56:27,520
Did we make that?

8504
04:56:27,520 --> 04:56:27,880
What is that?

8505
04:56:28,120 --> 04:56:28,980
Did you make that?

8506
04:56:29,060 --> 04:56:30,480
Did I make that?

8507
04:56:30,620 --> 04:56:31,660
Did you make that?

8508
04:56:32,000 --> 04:56:33,660
No, no, no, I didn't.

8509
04:56:33,740 --> 04:56:35,080
I broke my peepee tower.

8510
04:56:35,180 --> 04:56:36,320
Oh, no, I think it's just...

8511
04:56:36,320 --> 04:56:36,740
What the fuck is that?

8512
04:56:36,800 --> 04:56:38,120
It's a false peepee tower.

8513
04:56:38,380 --> 04:56:39,100
Ignore, ignore.

8514
04:56:40,100 --> 04:56:40,900
Wait, what?

8515
04:56:41,480 --> 04:56:41,940
What is this spot?

8516
04:56:41,940 --> 04:56:43,440
It's a false peepee tower.

8517
04:56:44,240 --> 04:56:45,480
Don't go towards the jungle.

8518
04:56:45,620 --> 04:56:47,300
I think there's not really villages in the jungle.

8519
04:56:47,300 --> 04:56:51,040
I feel like she's just, like, an inside job.

8520
04:56:51,980 --> 04:56:53,300
Oh, one of those...

8521
04:56:54,180 --> 04:56:55,280
Like, an industry plant?

8522
04:56:55,720 --> 04:56:58,240
Yeah, she has to be an industry plant.

8523
04:56:58,560 --> 04:56:59,740
I don't think so.

8524
04:57:00,180 --> 04:57:01,500
Like, I don't understand.

8525
04:57:01,640 --> 04:57:02,520
She's, like, mainstream.

8526
04:57:02,940 --> 04:57:04,840
So, it's like... I don't understand.

8527
04:57:05,360 --> 04:57:06,420
Am I not normie enough?

8528
04:57:06,660 --> 04:57:07,920
Wait, what is... Oh, no, that's a tree.

8529
04:57:08,040 --> 04:57:08,240
Just kidding.

8530
04:57:08,560 --> 04:57:09,500
Don't go towards the jungle.

8531
04:57:09,640 --> 04:57:09,960
Turn around.

8532
04:57:10,040 --> 04:57:10,840
Where do I go?

8533
04:57:10,980 --> 04:57:12,180
Here, let me... Yeah, my turn.

8534
04:57:12,500 --> 04:57:13,340
Yeah, your turn.

8535
04:57:15,320 --> 04:57:16,860
Oh, uh... Wait, hold on.

8536
04:57:17,080 --> 04:57:17,400
Hold on.

8537
04:57:17,600 --> 04:57:18,360
I was... Oh.

8538
04:57:18,360 --> 04:57:19,480
You were literally in the front seat.

8539
04:57:19,560 --> 04:57:22,580
They made a change where if somebody gets off, you're pushed to the front.

8540
04:57:22,900 --> 04:57:23,900
Oh, okay, okay.

8541
04:57:24,160 --> 04:57:24,680
Yeah, yeah.

8542
04:57:25,660 --> 04:57:27,480
I have no idea who you're talking about.

8543
04:57:28,320 --> 04:57:28,760
Google...

8544
04:57:29,400 --> 04:57:29,920
What's it?

8545
04:57:32,040 --> 04:57:33,340
It sounds French.

8546
04:57:33,580 --> 04:57:34,380
Not gonna lie.

8547
04:57:36,520 --> 04:57:39,600
You make it sound like a grandpa explaining it.

8548
04:57:39,600 --> 04:57:41,280
Like, we're gonna get that.

8549
04:57:47,680 --> 04:57:49,600
It's actually quite elegant.

8550
04:58:06,360 --> 04:58:08,140
What was that?

8551
04:58:08,140 --> 04:58:09,620
Oh, just a fish.

8552
04:58:10,180 --> 04:58:11,500
Anyway, Google that.

8553
04:58:11,800 --> 04:58:13,640
She's everywhere.

8554
04:58:14,040 --> 04:58:15,960
Oh, yeah, you can't miss her.

8555
04:58:17,100 --> 04:58:17,440
Yeah.

8556
04:58:19,760 --> 04:58:20,860
There's a savanna.

8557
04:58:21,240 --> 04:58:25,140
Yeah, maybe there'll be a place... But usually it's the plains ones that have the...

8558
04:58:26,240 --> 04:58:28,260
The brewing... Actually, no, I...

8559
04:58:28,260 --> 04:58:29,040
Oh, village!

8560
04:58:29,360 --> 04:58:29,860
Village!

8561
04:58:31,100 --> 04:58:31,660
Village!

8562
04:58:32,020 --> 04:58:32,840
I knew it!

8563
04:58:34,500 --> 04:58:36,320
Someone's like, wait, I get it now.

8564
04:58:36,400 --> 04:58:37,280
It is funny.

8565
04:58:37,280 --> 04:58:38,800
No, it's not.

8566
04:58:40,200 --> 04:58:43,720
It's cause we made an actual funny joke over it.

8567
04:58:44,220 --> 04:58:46,580
We fixed the joke, everybody.

8568
04:58:46,880 --> 04:58:48,660
We fixed it.

8569
04:58:48,820 --> 04:58:51,340
That's why you guys find it funny now.

8570
04:58:52,840 --> 04:58:54,340
We fixed it.

8571
04:58:54,340 --> 04:58:56,280
It's not our fault that we're so funny.

8572
04:58:58,340 --> 04:59:00,580
Oh, there's another saddle here.

8573
04:59:01,260 --> 04:59:03,600
We're just natural comedians.

8574
04:59:03,600 --> 04:59:08,160
Oh, this village kind of sucks.

8575
04:59:08,400 --> 04:59:09,880
Yeah, this village does suck.

8576
04:59:10,020 --> 04:59:12,880
Oh my gosh, the people in the savanna don't know how to fucking cook.

8577
04:59:13,900 --> 04:59:15,400
I got some bread and that's it.

8578
04:59:16,460 --> 04:59:18,420
I don't think they have it in the savanna.

8579
04:59:18,560 --> 04:59:20,120
Well, we have to sleep in this village anyway.

8580
04:59:20,480 --> 04:59:20,800
Yeah.

8581
04:59:22,980 --> 04:59:23,700
There's melons.

8582
04:59:25,060 --> 04:59:25,420
Melons!

8583
04:59:27,840 --> 04:59:29,100
Oh, I see you're going over there.

8584
04:59:29,920 --> 04:59:31,740
Yeah, I'm just trying to see if there's any more chest.

8585
04:59:31,820 --> 04:59:32,840
There's bread, but that's it.

8586
04:59:32,900 --> 04:59:33,580
I'm in the bed now.

8587
04:59:33,580 --> 04:59:34,460
You can sleep now.

8588
04:59:34,540 --> 04:59:35,640
Okay, I'm getting in the bed.

8589
04:59:36,640 --> 04:59:37,420
Get up, mister.

8590
04:59:39,820 --> 04:59:42,000
Too small, too small of a village.

8591
04:59:42,880 --> 04:59:44,360
My 5 million dollar contract.

8592
04:59:45,220 --> 04:59:45,960
I won't take it.

8593
04:59:46,040 --> 04:59:47,560
I just like to have it offered.

8594
04:59:47,760 --> 04:59:48,120
Really?

8595
04:59:51,260 --> 04:59:51,660
Yeah.

8596
04:59:54,580 --> 04:59:56,060
I don't know, actually.

8597
04:59:57,140 --> 04:59:58,380
I won't... I don't know.

8598
04:59:58,400 --> 05:00:00,060
5 million dollars is a lot.

8599
05:00:00,160 --> 05:00:01,040
It is a lot.

8600
05:00:01,360 --> 05:00:02,540
It is a lot.

8601
05:00:02,540 --> 05:00:06,600
I don't think, though, I would want a contract to exclusively stream on one place.

8602
05:00:06,600 --> 05:00:09,740
Yeah, I feel like... No, I'd be like, I'll take it, but like...

8603
05:00:09,740 --> 05:00:14,080
You know the xQc contract where he sometimes streams on kick, but not exclusively?

8604
05:00:14,940 --> 05:00:15,400
Oh, I know.

8605
05:00:15,400 --> 05:00:16,180
That's what he does.

8606
05:00:16,380 --> 05:00:18,720
But he got paid more than 5 million dollars.

8607
05:00:18,820 --> 05:00:19,740
He got paid like...

8608
05:00:19,740 --> 05:00:22,000
Like 50 million dollars or something.

8609
05:00:22,180 --> 05:00:23,220
I think we can leave this place.

8610
05:00:23,880 --> 05:00:24,680
Yeah, we can leave this.

8611
05:00:24,740 --> 05:00:25,160
Back to the boat.

8612
05:00:26,120 --> 05:00:27,200
Yeah, boat time.

8613
05:00:28,080 --> 05:00:28,860
I don't know.

8614
05:00:28,860 --> 05:00:29,860
I know, like...

8615
05:00:30,520 --> 05:00:31,260
Oh, my God.

8616
05:00:31,340 --> 05:00:35,140
I don't know if you got this offer on your YouTube channel, but like...

8617
05:00:35,140 --> 05:00:40,180
My YouTube partner manager was like emailing me and calling me, asking me if I want...

8618
05:00:40,180 --> 05:00:40,320
Calling you?

8619
05:00:40,660 --> 05:00:42,440
Yeah, no, they called me on my phone, too.

8620
05:00:43,020 --> 05:00:44,240
Oh, my God.

8621
05:00:44,900 --> 05:00:47,860
And they were asking me if I wanted to...

8622
05:00:49,160 --> 05:00:49,540
Oh, yeah.

8623
05:00:49,660 --> 05:00:51,000
No, xQc was a hundred million.

8624
05:00:51,240 --> 05:00:51,420
Yeah.

8625
05:00:52,060 --> 05:00:52,120
What?

8626
05:00:52,300 --> 05:00:52,900
That's insane.

8627
05:00:53,480 --> 05:00:57,960
He got a hundred million dollars to stream not exclusively on Twitch.

8628
05:00:57,960 --> 05:00:58,900
I mean Kick.

8629
05:00:59,160 --> 05:01:00,960
Basically, he can stream on Kick sometimes.

8630
05:01:01,700 --> 05:01:02,480
Not all the time.

8631
05:01:03,620 --> 05:01:04,380
Oh, my God.

8632
05:01:04,460 --> 05:01:05,720
He can keep his Twitch account.

8633
05:01:06,380 --> 05:01:07,380
Wait, am I going the right way?

8634
05:01:07,800 --> 05:01:09,130
I don't know, but like...

8635
05:01:10,920 --> 05:01:12,700
They called me and was like...

8636
05:01:12,700 --> 05:01:19,220
Oh, like for your VODs that got restricted to R18, which was my one VOD, which was the FNAF VOD.

8637
05:01:19,500 --> 05:01:20,090
Because I was like...

8638
05:01:20,740 --> 05:01:24,600
Apparently, I swore too much in that video and it got R18 gated.

8639
05:01:24,720 --> 05:01:25,320
Wow, good job.

8640
05:01:25,380 --> 05:01:26,200
That's because I was like...

8641
05:01:26,200 --> 05:01:28,640
Oh, I heard about that.

8642
05:01:28,720 --> 05:01:29,640
They were like...

8643
05:01:29,640 --> 05:01:30,760
You can't say...

8644
05:01:30,760 --> 05:01:32,560
Yeah, they thought you were saying, you know...

8645
05:01:32,560 --> 05:01:33,560
They saw I was saying whore.

8646
05:01:33,880 --> 05:01:34,340
So like...

8647
05:01:34,340 --> 05:01:35,360
And I was saying it a lot.

8648
05:01:38,040 --> 05:01:38,720
Let's just watch.

8649
05:01:39,860 --> 05:01:41,140
Yeah, I'll grab the boat.

8650
05:01:41,320 --> 05:01:41,520
Okay.

8651
05:01:42,080 --> 05:01:43,200
And so they were calling me.

8652
05:01:43,260 --> 05:01:43,680
They're like...

8653
05:01:43,680 --> 05:01:44,920
Because, you know, they're like...

8654
05:01:44,920 --> 05:01:45,440
Oh, hey.

8655
05:01:46,080 --> 05:01:49,840
We were wondering like for your VODs that got R18, we're trying this new thing.

8656
05:01:49,840 --> 05:01:52,020
And basically, it's like we're gonna...

8657
05:01:53,880 --> 05:01:55,980
Since R18 are like limited ads.

8658
05:01:56,180 --> 05:01:56,440
Yeah.

8659
05:01:56,880 --> 05:01:57,380
They're like...

8660
05:01:57,380 --> 05:02:01,460
Oh, can we put gambling and smoking and drinking ads on your videos?

8661
05:02:01,520 --> 05:02:01,940
What?

8662
05:02:02,980 --> 05:02:03,940
R18 videos.

8663
05:02:04,240 --> 05:02:04,980
I was like...

8664
05:02:04,980 --> 05:02:05,380
No.

8665
05:02:05,520 --> 05:02:06,360
There's another village.

8666
05:02:07,440 --> 05:02:08,340
Oh my god.

8667
05:02:08,580 --> 05:02:10,580
Because apparently, you can get a lot of money from that.

8668
05:02:10,940 --> 05:02:12,280
Because like it's...

8669
05:02:12,280 --> 05:02:14,100
You know, casinos pay so much.

8670
05:02:14,220 --> 05:02:14,960
And I was like...

8671
05:02:14,960 --> 05:02:15,500
No, I...

8672
05:02:15,500 --> 05:02:16,140
No, that's okay.

8673
05:02:16,240 --> 05:02:17,740
Do you get that money though?

8674
05:02:17,740 --> 05:02:19,700
No, I think you don't get the money to...

8675
05:02:19,700 --> 05:02:21,440
Like, it doesn't matter what ad.

8676
05:02:21,720 --> 05:02:21,820
It's ad revenue.

8677
05:02:22,220 --> 05:02:22,780
It's ad...

8678
05:02:22,780 --> 05:02:24,920
But then you get ad revenue from...

8679
05:02:24,920 --> 05:02:26,240
Yeah, but like...

8680
05:02:26,240 --> 05:02:27,900
Because like when it's restricted, you get...

8681
05:02:27,900 --> 05:02:28,300
You don't...

8682
05:02:28,300 --> 05:02:30,200
You tend to like not get ads and stuff.

8683
05:02:30,680 --> 05:02:30,900
But...

8684
05:02:30,900 --> 05:02:31,480
Oh, there's a prize!

8685
05:02:31,520 --> 05:02:31,920
There's a prize!

8686
05:02:32,040 --> 05:02:33,200
Oh, nice!

8687
05:02:33,960 --> 05:02:34,700
Oh my god.

8688
05:02:34,840 --> 05:02:35,860
We did it.

8689
05:02:36,500 --> 05:02:36,900
Chat.

8690
05:02:37,220 --> 05:02:37,620
Oh my god.

8691
05:02:37,860 --> 05:02:39,000
Reddit, we did it.

8692
05:02:40,240 --> 05:02:41,060
We did it.

8693
05:02:41,200 --> 05:02:41,860
This is the...

8694
05:02:41,860 --> 05:02:45,500
This might be the shortest hardcore session that streamers have ever done.

8695
05:02:45,540 --> 05:02:46,140
Right here.

8696
05:02:46,140 --> 05:02:47,200
Right here.

8697
05:02:47,500 --> 05:02:48,920
Right here, right now.

8698
05:02:49,660 --> 05:02:51,660
Okay, we still need the blaze rods, yeah.

8699
05:02:52,240 --> 05:02:53,140
Okay, um...

8700
05:02:53,680 --> 05:02:54,680
Anything else they got here?

8701
05:02:55,840 --> 05:02:56,960
Just pillage them.

8702
05:02:57,200 --> 05:02:57,580
Loot them.

8703
05:02:58,180 --> 05:02:59,200
Loot them for all they're worth.

8704
05:03:00,380 --> 05:03:00,940
Why is there...

8705
05:03:00,940 --> 05:03:01,660
They already looted everything.

8706
05:03:01,860 --> 05:03:03,640
Their villages are so terrible.

8707
05:03:04,240 --> 05:03:04,640
I don't know.

8708
05:03:04,820 --> 05:03:06,300
It's maybe because they're poor, man.

8709
05:03:07,520 --> 05:03:07,960
Maybe...

8710
05:03:07,960 --> 05:03:10,200
Oh, they have a better furnace here.

8711
05:03:11,280 --> 05:03:12,100
Oh, that furnace?

8712
05:03:12,320 --> 05:03:12,560
Nice.

8713
05:03:13,600 --> 05:03:14,720
How did you get inside?

8714
05:03:14,780 --> 05:03:15,320
Oh, there you are.

8715
05:03:16,260 --> 05:03:16,700
How...

8716
05:03:16,700 --> 05:03:17,620
What do I not need?

8717
05:03:18,120 --> 05:03:18,840
You wanna grab it?

8718
05:03:19,120 --> 05:03:19,540
Do you have room?

8719
05:03:21,300 --> 05:03:22,180
I do.

8720
05:03:22,380 --> 05:03:25,340
I can get rid of that one iron nugget or...

8721
05:03:25,340 --> 05:03:26,200
And the sweet seed.

8722
05:03:27,260 --> 05:03:27,560
Yeah.

8723
05:03:27,780 --> 05:03:29,020
Okay, what else can I get rid of?

8724
05:03:30,320 --> 05:03:30,760
Um...

8725
05:03:30,760 --> 05:03:32,820
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of the nether break.

8726
05:03:34,080 --> 05:03:34,520
And...

8727
05:03:34,520 --> 05:03:35,020
This.

8728
05:03:35,440 --> 05:03:35,840
Okay.

8729
05:03:36,060 --> 05:03:39,780
All we need now is we need an enchanting table.

8730
05:03:43,320 --> 05:03:44,560
Oh, we need a bunch of books.

8731
05:03:44,620 --> 05:03:45,440
I mean, I have obsidian for enchanting.

8732
05:03:45,440 --> 05:03:47,840
Yeah, we need books, but...

8733
05:03:47,840 --> 05:03:49,140
We need a lot of books.

8734
05:03:49,160 --> 05:03:49,620
Why did...

8735
05:03:49,620 --> 05:03:50,640
I should have kept the leather.

8736
05:03:50,880 --> 05:03:51,440
I should have...

8737
05:03:52,140 --> 05:03:52,960
Wait, no, no.

8738
05:03:53,000 --> 05:03:54,260
It doesn't matter because we don't have paper.

8739
05:03:55,200 --> 05:03:55,600
Yeah.

8740
05:04:01,300 --> 05:04:02,620
How do we wanna do this?

8741
05:04:03,440 --> 05:04:07,160
Do we go back into the nether and risk it now?

8742
05:04:08,080 --> 05:04:10,080
We have to find a...

8743
05:04:10,080 --> 05:04:10,720
I feel like...

8744
05:04:10,720 --> 05:04:12,740
I think at this point, we got...

8745
05:04:12,740 --> 05:04:13,900
Wait, how many...

8746
05:04:13,900 --> 05:04:15,840
How many enderpearls do we have?

8747
05:04:15,940 --> 05:04:17,280
I have six enderpearls.

8748
05:04:19,880 --> 05:04:20,800
I think...

8749
05:04:20,800 --> 05:04:25,800
I was gonna say it would be maybe more worth it to just go find a new enderpearl, but...

8750
05:04:25,800 --> 05:04:26,660
Or make a new one.

8751
05:04:27,040 --> 05:04:28,660
We left all our stuff back there.

8752
05:04:29,300 --> 05:04:30,560
I didn't leave my stuff.

8753
05:04:34,090 --> 05:04:36,510
I left a lot of my stuff in that chest.

8754
05:04:38,850 --> 05:04:41,290
Wait, I don't even know what I left there.

8755
05:04:41,970 --> 05:04:43,710
Then you won't miss it.

8756
05:04:43,970 --> 05:04:44,950
You won't even know.

8757
05:04:45,590 --> 05:04:46,450
I mean...

8758
05:04:46,450 --> 05:04:46,790
What did we deported?

8759
05:04:47,130 --> 05:04:48,250
We can go back.

8760
05:04:48,290 --> 05:04:49,130
We can go back.

8761
05:04:49,130 --> 05:04:49,930
Where was the boat?

8762
05:04:50,090 --> 05:04:51,610
Chat, chat, was it important?

8763
05:04:52,030 --> 05:04:53,130
Chat... No, I have the boat.

8764
05:04:53,630 --> 05:04:54,870
Chat, was it important?

8765
05:04:55,070 --> 05:04:57,950
Because I don't remember if it was important.

8766
05:05:00,650 --> 05:05:01,450
The sugarcane?

8767
05:05:01,630 --> 05:05:02,330
Do we need paper?

8768
05:05:05,650 --> 05:05:06,770
Yeah, that makes paper.

8769
05:05:07,110 --> 05:05:07,790
The sugarcane.

8770
05:05:08,110 --> 05:05:09,570
But we need a lot of it.

8771
05:05:09,750 --> 05:05:11,010
We're gonna need a ton of it.

8772
05:05:11,670 --> 05:05:12,210
Okay, yeah.

8773
05:05:12,270 --> 05:05:14,610
Then it's easier for us to just find bookcases.

8774
05:05:14,970 --> 05:05:15,570
I think so.

8775
05:05:15,910 --> 05:05:16,910
More pillaging, maybe.

8776
05:05:19,390 --> 05:05:19,790
Alright.

8777
05:05:20,730 --> 05:05:21,490
Here we go.

8778
05:05:21,830 --> 05:05:22,490
Why are you swimming?

8779
05:05:22,610 --> 05:05:23,910
I literally put the boat down.

8780
05:05:23,950 --> 05:05:24,510
I didn't know!

8781
05:05:24,630 --> 05:05:25,190
I didn't see!

8782
05:05:25,690 --> 05:05:26,810
Oh my gosh!

8783
05:05:27,470 --> 05:05:28,690
Oh, it's lapis blocks!

8784
05:05:28,770 --> 05:05:30,310
I left all the lapis blocks there.

8785
05:05:30,350 --> 05:05:31,030
Oh, okay.

8786
05:05:31,090 --> 05:05:31,910
We do need those.

8787
05:05:32,110 --> 05:05:32,970
Yeah, we do need those.

8788
05:05:33,030 --> 05:05:35,610
It was like a stack of lapis.

8789
05:05:35,990 --> 05:05:36,350
Okay.

8790
05:05:36,890 --> 05:05:37,990
How do we get back?

8791
05:05:38,790 --> 05:05:39,010
Okay.

8792
05:05:39,150 --> 05:05:40,130
You fucking had the coordinates.

8793
05:05:40,250 --> 05:05:43,210
Doki, I'm gonna give you the coordinates and you're gonna guide us, okay?

8794
05:05:43,950 --> 05:05:44,290
Okay.

8795
05:05:45,110 --> 05:05:46,170
Okay, I gotta get the boulder.

8796
05:05:46,330 --> 05:05:46,570
Hold on.

8797
05:05:46,850 --> 05:05:47,110
Okay.

8798
05:05:47,110 --> 05:05:52,090
Alright, so the first part, we weren't able to get that done.

8799
05:05:52,270 --> 05:05:52,430
Okay.

8800
05:05:54,510 --> 05:05:55,310
It's, um...

8801
05:05:55,310 --> 05:06:00,110
Okay, it's negative four, one, one, six...

8802
05:06:01,090 --> 05:06:03,430
Negative four, one, one, six...

8803
05:06:03,430 --> 05:06:04,590
Oh, why can't I...

8804
05:06:04,590 --> 05:06:05,170
Write that down.

8805
05:06:05,290 --> 05:06:06,170
Chat, write that down.

8806
05:06:06,250 --> 05:06:07,410
Why can't I send a message?

8807
05:06:07,950 --> 05:06:09,090
Why don't you just look at chat?

8808
05:06:10,890 --> 05:06:12,510
Why can't I send a chat message?

8809
05:06:13,090 --> 05:06:14,130
I don't fucking know.

8810
05:06:14,210 --> 05:06:15,110
This is your server!

8811
05:06:16,130 --> 05:06:18,110
Oh, maybe I didn't give you permission.

8812
05:06:18,750 --> 05:06:19,310
Lol.

8813
05:06:21,930 --> 05:06:24,770
Wait, what does it say when you try to send it?

8814
05:06:24,970 --> 05:06:27,390
It says, cannot send chat message.

8815
05:06:28,550 --> 05:06:29,110
Lol.

8816
05:06:29,590 --> 05:06:30,070
Lol.

8817
05:06:31,490 --> 05:06:32,050
Bad.

8818
05:06:32,750 --> 05:06:33,310
Muted.

8819
05:06:37,130 --> 05:06:39,170
Wait, why can't I send chat message?

8820
05:06:39,550 --> 05:06:41,950
Oh, I think you have to...

8821
05:06:41,950 --> 05:06:43,330
Your account might be like...

8822
05:06:43,330 --> 05:06:43,790
It's like...

8823
05:06:45,090 --> 05:06:46,890
It's not the server.

8824
05:06:47,310 --> 05:06:50,330
It's like your account got marked...

8825
05:06:51,230 --> 05:06:52,410
Am I marked as a baby?

8826
05:06:52,830 --> 05:06:54,290
Yeah, you're marked as a baby.

8827
05:06:54,890 --> 05:06:55,250
No!

8828
05:06:55,650 --> 05:06:56,970
Oh, why did that happen?

8829
05:06:58,310 --> 05:06:58,710
No!

8830
05:06:58,770 --> 05:07:00,290
I think I'm marked as a baby.

8831
05:07:01,110 --> 05:07:01,930
I don't know.

8832
05:07:03,350 --> 05:07:04,770
Wait, how are we gonna do this?

8833
05:07:04,890 --> 05:07:06,910
You have the coordinates, I gave them to you.

8834
05:07:07,090 --> 05:07:07,250
Alright.

8835
05:07:07,470 --> 05:07:08,150
Yeah, chat, chat.

8836
05:07:08,210 --> 05:07:09,350
What was the coordinates, chat?

8837
05:07:09,590 --> 05:07:10,150
Yeah, chat.

8838
05:07:10,890 --> 05:07:12,830
Doki's chat never lies to her, apparently.

8839
05:07:12,830 --> 05:07:13,410
So, you know.

8840
05:07:15,830 --> 05:07:16,230
Yeah.

8841
05:07:17,310 --> 05:07:18,390
Chat, what was it?

8842
05:07:19,850 --> 05:07:20,890
I'm just gonna keep going.

8843
05:07:21,310 --> 05:07:23,270
Negative 4116, negative 4116.

8844
05:07:23,410 --> 05:07:23,750
And?

8845
05:07:24,670 --> 05:07:26,270
You never gave me the Z.

8846
05:07:26,470 --> 05:07:27,270
Yes, I did!

8847
05:07:27,630 --> 05:07:28,490
No, you didn't!

8848
05:07:28,510 --> 05:07:28,970
Yes, I did!

8849
05:07:28,970 --> 05:07:29,890
You really just...

8850
05:07:29,890 --> 05:07:32,130
No, I remember you said the X only.

8851
05:07:32,250 --> 05:07:34,070
And then you're like, oh, why can't I write it down?

8852
05:07:34,190 --> 05:07:35,450
Oh, because I was typing it.

8853
05:07:35,510 --> 05:07:40,750
Okay, it's negative 4116 and then 1576.

8854
05:07:42,310 --> 05:07:42,710
1576.

8855
05:07:43,130 --> 05:07:45,570
Okay, negative 4116.

8856
05:07:46,410 --> 05:07:47,130
Keep going.

8857
05:07:47,910 --> 05:07:48,610
Okay, I'm going.

8858
05:07:48,830 --> 05:07:49,130
I'm going.

8859
05:07:50,110 --> 05:07:50,910
Negative 4116.

8860
05:07:51,090 --> 05:07:52,490
Okay, you're the one navigating.

8861
05:07:52,750 --> 05:07:54,330
Oh wait, that's the false peepee tower.

8862
05:07:55,490 --> 05:07:55,890
1576.

8863
05:07:56,350 --> 05:07:57,510
Oh yeah, that's the fake one.

8864
05:07:57,590 --> 05:07:58,410
Yeah, we're close.

8865
05:07:58,990 --> 05:08:00,150
We didn't go that far at all.

8866
05:08:00,810 --> 05:08:01,370
Okay, what do you need?

8867
05:08:02,150 --> 05:08:03,150
Is there anything else you need?

8868
05:08:03,270 --> 05:08:06,310
Okay, while you roll that boat, I'm gonna feed my dog.

8869
05:08:06,610 --> 05:08:06,990
What?

8870
05:08:07,170 --> 05:08:09,750
I gave you those coordinates so that you would...

8871
05:08:10,570 --> 05:08:13,550
I gave you the coordinates so that you would guide me.

8872
05:08:15,130 --> 05:08:16,770
I'm not gonna look at it.

8873
05:08:16,890 --> 05:08:17,810
You're fine, you're fine.

8874
05:08:17,930 --> 05:08:18,450
I'll be right back.

8875
05:08:24,710 --> 05:08:25,830
This is...

8876
05:08:25,830 --> 05:08:28,030
Who is pulling all the weight here, everybody?

8877
05:08:28,570 --> 05:08:33,750
I want everybody to remember that it is I, Mint Phantom...

8878
05:08:34,450 --> 05:08:37,930
that has been pulling all the weight in this collab.

8879
05:08:38,510 --> 05:08:40,290
I'm getting us back to that.

8880
05:08:40,450 --> 05:08:42,170
I've been telling her all the information.

8881
05:08:42,810 --> 05:08:45,010
I'm getting us back to our tower.

8882
05:08:45,450 --> 05:08:47,150
I'm doing all of this.

8883
05:08:48,290 --> 05:08:49,570
Should I break the boat?

8884
05:08:49,690 --> 05:08:50,270
Let her drown?

8885
05:08:50,970 --> 05:08:52,970
I don't think she'll be back in time to save herself.

8886
05:08:56,730 --> 05:09:00,630
I don't think she'll be back in time to save herself.

8887
05:09:02,670 --> 05:09:04,010
Guys, if we...

8888
05:09:04,010 --> 05:09:05,010
There's enough sabotage.

8889
05:09:05,010 --> 05:09:07,010
If we die, we die...

8890
05:09:07,670 --> 05:09:08,810
natural causes.

8891
05:09:09,590 --> 05:09:11,010
Natural causes being...

8892
05:09:11,650 --> 05:09:12,590
like a ghast.

8893
05:09:16,830 --> 05:09:18,670
Though I will...

8894
05:09:20,830 --> 05:09:21,970
build a...

8895
05:09:22,350 --> 05:09:27,910
a thing for me and have her face the consequences of...

8896
05:09:27,910 --> 05:09:31,570
I think I'm going the right way.

8897
05:09:32,350 --> 05:09:34,750
She will have to fight for herself...

8898
05:09:34,750 --> 05:09:38,010
against the night time terrors.

8899
05:09:40,250 --> 05:09:41,690
Drowning is natural.

8900
05:09:45,110 --> 05:09:46,830
It's beer o'clock.

8901
05:09:48,490 --> 05:09:50,630
It's starting to get real dark.

8902
05:09:56,590 --> 05:09:59,510
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

8903
05:10:00,190 --> 05:10:02,850
I haven't checked even a single one time.

8904
05:10:03,610 --> 05:10:06,170
Oh, so you're gonna try and kill me, huh?

8905
05:10:06,790 --> 05:10:07,770
I didn't say that.

8906
05:10:07,970 --> 05:10:09,510
Why are you gonna try and kill me?

8907
05:10:09,630 --> 05:10:13,850
I said that I will leave you to yourself...

8908
05:10:13,850 --> 05:10:15,170
when the night time comes.

8909
05:10:15,510 --> 05:10:17,450
Oh, you're not even gonna try and protect me.

8910
05:10:17,530 --> 05:10:17,930
I see.

8911
05:10:17,970 --> 05:10:18,930
When the night comes...

8912
05:10:18,930 --> 05:10:19,470
I see.

8913
05:10:19,730 --> 05:10:21,210
Am I in the right direction?

8914
05:10:24,030 --> 05:10:24,910
Negative 4116?

8915
05:10:25,390 --> 05:10:26,110
Yeah, maybe.

8916
05:10:27,150 --> 05:10:27,970
What do you mean maybe?

8917
05:10:28,470 --> 05:10:29,730
Is that what it is?

8918
05:10:29,990 --> 05:10:31,510
What do you mean maybe?

8919
05:10:31,510 --> 05:10:32,870
Okay, get off the boat.

8920
05:10:32,930 --> 05:10:34,750
We need to sleep.

8921
05:10:34,850 --> 05:10:35,390
We need to sleep.

8922
05:10:35,730 --> 05:10:36,030
Okay.

8923
05:10:37,930 --> 05:10:40,410
Who's a baby now about wanting to sleep, huh?

8924
05:10:41,290 --> 05:10:42,010
Oh, okay.

8925
05:10:42,250 --> 05:10:43,510
We don't need to sleep then.

8926
05:10:43,710 --> 05:10:44,350
I'm sleeping.

8927
05:10:44,470 --> 05:10:46,590
Negative 41161576.

8928
05:10:46,950 --> 05:10:47,670
I'm asleep.

8929
05:10:49,750 --> 05:10:51,350
And you still slept.

8930
05:10:55,150 --> 05:10:56,710
Alright, get over here.

8931
05:10:57,030 --> 05:10:57,730
Come on.

8932
05:10:58,010 --> 05:10:58,970
Hop on my boat.

8933
05:10:59,790 --> 05:11:00,190
Alright.

8934
05:11:00,190 --> 05:11:01,850
So which way do I need to go?

8935
05:11:03,030 --> 05:11:07,110
1576 is the negative 4116.

8936
05:11:08,150 --> 05:11:09,970
Do you think we can ask this guy for directions?

8937
05:11:11,290 --> 05:11:11,850
Sure.

8938
05:11:12,850 --> 05:11:14,190
Hello sir, do you...

8939
05:11:14,870 --> 05:11:17,610
Yes, Min was gonna drown you by breaking the boat.

8940
05:11:17,910 --> 05:11:18,890
I didn't say that.

8941
05:11:18,990 --> 05:11:20,130
My chat suggested that.

8942
05:11:20,530 --> 05:11:21,650
You know who said that?

8943
05:11:21,990 --> 05:11:22,330
What?

8944
05:11:22,730 --> 05:11:24,130
Your favorite guy, Eragon.

8945
05:11:24,650 --> 05:11:24,910
Eragon?

8946
05:11:25,470 --> 05:11:28,030
This guy has no loyalty to anybody.

8947
05:11:31,910 --> 05:11:33,750
Oh my god!

8948
05:11:34,030 --> 05:11:35,650
He has no loyalty!

8949
05:11:36,890 --> 05:11:38,670
He's a professional snitch.

8950
05:11:45,930 --> 05:11:47,350
I'm starting to get hungry.

8951
05:11:47,350 --> 05:11:49,290
That's not even a wisp goon!

8952
05:11:49,590 --> 05:11:49,890
I know.

8953
05:11:50,470 --> 05:11:50,950
What was it?

8954
05:11:51,030 --> 05:11:52,010
An SSR?

8955
05:11:52,250 --> 05:11:52,750
Yeah.

8956
05:11:54,290 --> 05:11:54,930
SSRP.

8957
05:11:56,310 --> 05:11:57,450
What does that mean?

8958
05:11:58,010 --> 05:11:59,110
Super-sized roleplay?

8959
05:12:01,410 --> 05:12:03,290
Am I going the right way?

8960
05:12:04,830 --> 05:12:05,990
Negative 144...

8961
05:12:05,990 --> 05:12:06,110
What?

8962
05:12:06,230 --> 05:12:08,430
Stop telling me numbers and tell me directions!

8963
05:12:08,830 --> 05:12:09,310
I don't...

8964
05:12:10,040 --> 05:12:11,510
I thought you were okay!

8965
05:12:12,070 --> 05:12:13,430
Oh my god, okay.

8966
05:12:13,750 --> 05:12:16,230
We're negative 49?!

8967
05:12:22,490 --> 05:12:24,850
I thought you had your coordinates out.

8968
05:12:24,850 --> 05:12:27,950
No, that's why I gave them to you to be the navigator.

8969
05:12:28,490 --> 05:12:29,450
I thought you had

8970
05:12:33,220 --> 05:12:33,880
your boat.

8971
05:12:34,240 --> 05:12:35,920
Get off the boat.

8972
05:12:36,380 --> 05:12:37,880
You're not allowed.

8973
05:12:37,880 --> 05:12:41,200
Okay, while you direct, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

8974
05:12:47,640 --> 05:12:51,880
Oh my god, where did you end up going?!

8975
05:12:53,740 --> 05:12:55,560
Oh my god, what was the coordinates?

8976
05:12:56,380 --> 05:12:59,020
Negative 4116...

8977
05:12:59,020 --> 05:13:03,320
Oh my god, where did she end up going?!

8978
05:13:03,320 --> 05:13:05,820
Like, we're at 700!

8979
05:13:07,880 --> 05:13:13,620
Oh my god, how did we get to 700?!

8980
05:13:13,620 --> 05:13:16,640
How do I get out of here?!

8981
05:13:16,640 --> 05:13:18,460
Okay, it's this one.

8982
05:13:19,300 --> 05:13:21,780
Try to reduce the numbers.

8983
05:13:22,220 --> 05:13:25,140
Oh my god.

8984
05:13:26,320 --> 05:13:27,880
Okay, this...

8985
05:13:27,880 --> 05:13:32,880
How did she fucking get 600 coordinates away?!

8986
05:13:34,140 --> 05:13:37,300
She just followed the coast...

8987
05:13:37,300 --> 05:13:39,580
What if I let her drown here?!

8988
05:13:39,580 --> 05:13:43,120
What if I let her drown?!

8989
05:13:44,220 --> 05:13:47,760
How's my GPU hitting 100 too?!

8990
05:13:47,760 --> 05:13:49,240
Like, what is wrong with this?!

8991
05:13:49,240 --> 05:13:50,820
Oh, this Minecraft is too beautiful.

8992
05:13:51,220 --> 05:13:54,640
I think it's my resource pack.

8993
05:13:55,220 --> 05:13:55,520
Alright.

8994
05:13:56,580 --> 05:13:58,020
No, it's the right way.

8995
05:13:59,200 --> 05:14:00,600
Oh, 1-5...

8996
05:14:00,600 --> 05:14:03,000
Oh my god, it's 1-5-7-6.

8997
05:14:03,100 --> 05:14:05,300
Oh my god, I'm fucking...

8998
05:14:05,300 --> 05:14:06,760
I'm losing it right now.

8999
05:14:06,940 --> 05:14:09,280
I'm reading numbers wrong too.

9000
05:14:11,560 --> 05:14:13,780
I'm fucking... Guys, no, you don't understand.

9001
05:14:13,920 --> 05:14:15,100
I'm losing it as well.

9002
05:14:16,240 --> 05:14:18,720
I'm losing it as well.

9003
05:14:22,280 --> 05:14:27,100
She took us so far that I fucking... I didn't even know where I was going at that point.

9004
05:14:27,300 --> 05:14:29,020
I've lost track as well.

9005
05:14:31,360 --> 05:14:33,460
Okay, does this go down?

9006
05:14:34,180 --> 05:14:35,940
Which way goes down?

9007
05:14:37,620 --> 05:14:38,600
This way?

9008
05:14:45,230 --> 05:14:46,150
This way.

9009
05:14:46,350 --> 05:14:47,390
This goes down.

9010
05:14:47,850 --> 05:14:49,050
This way goes down.

9011
05:14:49,570 --> 05:14:50,210
Okay.

9012
05:14:54,250 --> 05:14:55,410
Okay, that way.

9013
05:14:55,530 --> 05:14:56,750
Okay, we figured it out.

9014
05:14:57,310 --> 05:14:59,350
Sorry, I got very lost.

9015
05:14:59,950 --> 05:15:04,410
She was getting further and further away from our destination.

9016
05:15:06,730 --> 05:15:10,730
Oh my god, what did I end up getting in my fucking inventory?

9017
05:15:15,210 --> 05:15:17,310
Oh my god, where did she take us?

9018
05:15:17,910 --> 05:15:20,450
Where the fuck did she take us?

9019
05:15:20,550 --> 05:15:21,070
I'm back.

9020
05:15:21,510 --> 05:15:23,670
Oh my god, where did you take us?

9021
05:15:23,850 --> 05:15:24,410
I don't know.

9022
05:15:24,630 --> 05:15:26,530
I just was following the edge of the world.

9023
05:15:26,790 --> 05:15:32,550
I thought I... I thought me saying the numbers was like 3-0.

9024
05:15:33,390 --> 05:15:34,850
No, that's why I gave you the numbers.

9025
05:15:35,730 --> 05:15:36,630
What do you want me to do?

9026
05:15:36,630 --> 05:15:36,950
Left?

9027
05:15:37,050 --> 05:15:37,330
Right?

9028
05:15:38,570 --> 05:15:39,730
Yeah, basically.

9029
05:15:40,710 --> 05:15:42,070
Oh my god.

9030
05:15:42,110 --> 05:15:44,650
I could hear you screaming while I was walking away.

9031
05:15:45,950 --> 05:15:47,070
From my headphones.

9032
05:15:50,250 --> 05:15:53,230
I don't even know where you took us anymore.

9033
05:15:53,810 --> 05:15:56,770
I'm trying to figure out this pathway.

9034
05:15:58,030 --> 05:15:59,590
Okay, I remember this savanna.

9035
05:16:02,150 --> 05:16:03,190
What were the coordinates?

9036
05:16:03,190 --> 05:16:04,030
It's not the wrong way.

9037
05:16:04,110 --> 05:16:06,030
It's not the wrong way, guys.

9038
05:16:06,030 --> 05:16:10,990
I'm just trying to navigate this fucking hellhole that Mint took us through.

9039
05:16:11,170 --> 05:16:12,270
What were the coordinates again?

9040
05:16:14,650 --> 05:16:16,670
Negative 4-1-1-6.

9041
05:16:17,210 --> 05:16:18,590
Because we're close to that.

9042
05:16:18,710 --> 05:16:19,310
We're close to that.

9043
05:16:19,410 --> 05:16:20,350
Get off the boat.

9044
05:16:20,430 --> 05:16:21,450
Get off the boat.

9045
05:16:21,550 --> 05:16:22,990
We're fucking... We're gonna walk now.

9046
05:16:24,530 --> 05:16:26,030
We've lost your...

9047
05:16:26,730 --> 05:16:27,670
Alright, here we go.

9048
05:16:28,990 --> 05:16:32,030
Negative 4-1-1-6 and...

9049
05:16:32,830 --> 05:16:33,470
What's the Z?

9050
05:16:35,550 --> 05:16:38,370
1-4-something... 1-5-7-6.

9051
05:16:38,510 --> 05:16:39,430
Oh, we're going the wrong way then.

9052
05:16:39,850 --> 05:16:40,230
Oh, this way.

9053
05:16:40,530 --> 05:16:40,910
This way.

9054
05:16:41,090 --> 05:16:41,210
Yeah.

9055
05:16:41,910 --> 05:16:42,590
We're not.

9056
05:16:42,870 --> 05:16:43,830
Yeah, now it's right.

9057
05:16:44,570 --> 05:16:45,910
I was going the right way.

9058
05:16:46,210 --> 05:16:46,670
This way.

9059
05:16:47,910 --> 05:16:48,990
Yeah, my way.

9060
05:16:49,430 --> 05:16:50,050
Yeah, my way.

9061
05:16:50,290 --> 05:16:51,690
Oh my god, there's so many bunnies here.

9062
05:16:51,850 --> 05:16:52,270
My way.

9063
05:16:52,990 --> 05:16:53,610
My way.

9064
05:16:53,830 --> 05:16:54,410
No, my way.

9065
05:16:55,110 --> 05:16:56,110
No, my way.

9066
05:16:56,250 --> 05:16:56,730
Where are you?

9067
05:16:57,570 --> 05:16:57,990
I don't know.

9068
05:16:58,050 --> 05:16:58,510
Where are you?

9069
05:16:59,030 --> 05:16:59,850
I'm going my way.

9070
05:17:00,290 --> 05:17:01,250
I'm going my way.

9071
05:17:01,390 --> 05:17:03,230
We're both going the same direction, I assume.

9072
05:17:03,310 --> 05:17:04,790
Because we're both at the same coordinates.

9073
05:17:05,530 --> 05:17:05,930
Yeah.

9074
05:17:06,950 --> 05:17:08,910
Oh my god, are those cows on trees?

9075
05:17:10,030 --> 05:17:11,350
What are they doing up there?

9076
05:17:11,870 --> 05:17:12,150
No.

9077
05:17:12,410 --> 05:17:13,270
I see you.

9078
05:17:13,370 --> 05:17:14,690
No, they're cows on the cliff.

9079
05:17:14,850 --> 05:17:15,990
They're cows on the cliff.

9080
05:17:17,450 --> 05:17:18,950
We're just having a good time.

9081
05:17:19,210 --> 05:17:19,610
Yeah.

9082
05:17:19,950 --> 05:17:20,850
Just like us.

9083
05:17:21,810 --> 05:17:22,210
Yeah.

9084
05:17:23,370 --> 05:17:23,770
Yeah.

9085
05:17:23,770 --> 05:17:23,930
Yeah.

9086
05:17:28,690 --> 05:17:29,050
Yeah.

9087
05:17:30,330 --> 05:17:33,790
You guys, she's gonna try and strangle me in a couple days when I say it.

9088
05:17:35,630 --> 05:17:36,970
Oh shit, I'm going the wrong way.

9089
05:17:37,830 --> 05:17:38,350
I'm supposed to go this way.

9090
05:17:38,370 --> 05:17:39,410
Are you going the wrong way?

9091
05:17:39,910 --> 05:17:41,670
Oh my god, that was close!

9092
05:17:42,450 --> 05:17:43,470
I gamed over that?

9093
05:17:47,790 --> 05:17:50,050
I thought I was going the right way and then I went the wrong way.

9094
05:17:50,230 --> 05:17:50,430
Okay.

9095
05:17:50,670 --> 05:17:52,370
That's probably how I got lost in the first place.

9096
05:17:53,210 --> 05:17:53,570
Probably.

9097
05:17:54,070 --> 05:17:55,790
Oh, now you have your F3 open.

9098
05:17:55,930 --> 05:17:58,670
Wow, when we're not using the boat, you have your F3 open.

9099
05:17:58,690 --> 05:18:01,810
Well, I can't drive and look at the F3 at the same time.

9100
05:18:01,850 --> 05:18:06,610
Oh yeah, guys, remember, don't Minecraft and drive at the same time.

9101
05:18:06,690 --> 05:18:08,950
Guys, don't read and drive.

9102
05:18:09,650 --> 05:18:11,330
Aragon gave you a good report.

9103
05:18:14,230 --> 05:18:15,290
Oh yeah, what did he say?

9104
05:18:15,890 --> 05:18:16,690
He said you were good.

9105
05:18:17,130 --> 05:18:17,870
You were a good girl.

9106
05:18:17,930 --> 05:18:18,110
Yeah?

9107
05:18:18,250 --> 05:18:18,710
That's what he said.

9108
05:18:18,710 --> 05:18:18,950
The boat.

9109
05:18:21,330 --> 05:18:22,870
Was I not a good girl?

9110
05:18:23,150 --> 05:18:24,870
What was your death threat against me?

9111
05:18:27,030 --> 05:18:28,770
I'm fucking taking the boat out.

9112
05:18:29,030 --> 05:18:31,230
I don't think you should phrase it like that.

9113
05:18:36,090 --> 05:18:38,950
What was your death threat against me?

9114
05:18:39,310 --> 05:18:40,790
I'm taking the boat, goodbye.

9115
05:18:41,470 --> 05:18:42,750
Wait, what do you mean you're taking the boat?

9116
05:18:43,030 --> 05:18:45,170
I'm taking the boat, goodbye.

9117
05:18:45,470 --> 05:18:46,510
Why are you taking the boat?

9118
05:18:46,870 --> 05:18:47,510
Where are you?

9119
05:18:48,710 --> 05:18:52,130
We're gonna both be... make it to the same place anyway.

9120
05:18:52,570 --> 05:18:54,290
Okay, I'll just be a little longer.

9121
05:18:54,650 --> 05:18:55,530
I'm gonna get lost.

9122
05:18:55,550 --> 05:18:56,390
Look at the coordinates again.

9123
05:18:57,170 --> 05:18:59,330
4-1-1-6.

9124
05:19:00,010 --> 05:19:00,430
And?

9125
05:19:00,670 --> 05:19:03,630
1-5-7-6, so it's here.

9126
05:19:05,470 --> 05:19:07,190
1-5-7-6?

9127
05:19:07,670 --> 05:19:09,210
1-5-7-6.

9128
05:19:09,230 --> 05:19:11,330
I thought it was 106.

9129
05:19:14,390 --> 05:19:16,050
I was gonna...

9130
05:19:20,170 --> 05:19:21,290
Oh, we know.

9131
05:19:21,430 --> 05:19:21,890
Okay.

9132
05:19:22,330 --> 05:19:24,350
Oh my god, can I take this bird home?

9133
05:19:24,690 --> 05:19:25,830
Oh my god.

9134
05:19:26,190 --> 05:19:27,730
Did you go to the jungle?

9135
05:19:27,910 --> 05:19:30,330
Did you go to the jungle?

9136
05:19:30,590 --> 05:19:32,270
Are you at the jungle?

9137
05:19:32,270 --> 05:19:33,830
I'm about to leave the jungle.

9138
05:19:34,170 --> 05:19:36,110
Are you at the jungle?

9139
05:19:36,650 --> 05:19:38,750
I literally pulled a Patrick Starr.

9140
05:19:39,230 --> 05:19:47,290
Why don't you guys say something sooner?

9141
05:19:47,290 --> 05:19:49,350
I bet they were.

9142
05:19:49,550 --> 05:19:50,590
I bet they were.

9143
05:19:51,790 --> 05:19:53,690
I see the doggos again.

9144
05:19:53,970 --> 05:19:55,350
What was the coordinate?

9145
05:19:55,750 --> 05:19:58,790
1-0-4-1-1-6.

9146
05:19:59,670 --> 05:20:00,850
I found the portal.

9147
05:20:01,670 --> 05:20:03,390
1-5-7-6.

9148
05:20:03,970 --> 05:20:05,770
1-5-7-6.

9149
05:20:05,830 --> 05:20:06,670
Oh, I'm a little far.

9150
05:20:06,810 --> 05:20:06,950
Okay.

9151
05:20:08,510 --> 05:20:09,930
I'll be there eventually.

9152
05:20:10,130 --> 05:20:11,830
Can I have the boat?

9153
05:20:14,730 --> 05:20:16,090
There's trees everywhere.

9154
05:20:16,090 --> 05:20:19,510
Was that something you said to me?

9155
05:20:19,630 --> 05:20:21,110
I was like, oh, you didn't get the boat.

9156
05:20:21,310 --> 05:20:22,770
Oh, there's trees everywhere.

9157
05:20:22,990 --> 05:20:25,770
That's literally what you told me.

9158
05:20:25,890 --> 05:20:28,850
I'm getting stuff to make books, just in case.

9159
05:20:30,970 --> 05:20:31,990
I'm doing my part.

9160
05:20:32,290 --> 05:20:33,870
I got my boat.

9161
05:20:35,570 --> 05:20:36,670
I was hungry.

9162
05:20:37,050 --> 05:20:38,550
I haven't had dinner.

9163
05:20:39,970 --> 05:20:40,850
I'm hungry.

9164
05:20:42,510 --> 05:20:44,050
We gotta sleep soon.

9165
05:20:44,550 --> 05:20:44,910
Okay.

9166
05:20:46,850 --> 05:20:49,050
Alright, do we need to go back to the nether?

9167
05:20:52,370 --> 05:20:53,630
Probably to find a fortress.

9168
05:20:54,590 --> 05:20:57,650
Alright, I'm gonna put my stuff away then in this thing.

9169
05:20:58,670 --> 05:21:00,010
I'm gonna give you the spectral arrow.

9170
05:21:00,190 --> 05:21:01,870
I'm putting it in the chest so you can take it.

9171
05:21:02,070 --> 05:21:03,110
Okay, yeah, I'll use it.

9172
05:21:03,550 --> 05:21:04,990
It's like, you have the bow anyway.

9173
05:21:05,330 --> 05:21:06,190
Why don't you make a bow?

9174
05:21:06,470 --> 05:21:06,970
Just make one.

9175
05:21:07,510 --> 05:21:08,210
I don't wanna.

9176
05:21:08,590 --> 05:21:10,210
It becomes apex then.

9177
05:21:14,350 --> 05:21:15,930
Okay, I'm gonna sleep.

9178
05:21:16,670 --> 05:21:18,110
Oh my god.

9179
05:21:18,810 --> 05:21:19,950
Wait, okay.

9180
05:21:20,250 --> 05:21:20,990
I'm going to sleep.

9181
05:21:21,410 --> 05:21:22,650
I'm going to sleep too.

9182
05:21:23,590 --> 05:21:24,890
I'll go sleep.

9183
05:21:25,110 --> 05:21:25,250
Sleep.

9184
05:21:25,830 --> 05:21:26,190
Now.

9185
05:21:30,510 --> 05:21:31,270
Alright.

9186
05:21:32,430 --> 05:21:33,930
Where's my string?

9187
05:21:34,530 --> 05:21:35,750
Bow time.

9188
05:21:36,590 --> 05:21:38,390
Alright, I made my bow.

9189
05:21:38,810 --> 05:21:39,250
Nice.

9190
05:21:39,250 --> 05:21:41,690
And I'm gonna put away...

9191
05:21:41,690 --> 05:21:42,850
I'm gonna put away some stuff.

9192
05:21:42,950 --> 05:21:44,630
Put away sugar cane, dirt.

9193
05:21:45,390 --> 05:21:46,430
Cut my water.

9194
05:21:47,470 --> 05:21:50,290
I don't need the water yet because the enderman...

9195
05:21:50,290 --> 05:21:51,210
Like, it's the nether.

9196
05:21:51,470 --> 05:21:53,010
Yeah, we only need it for the fight.

9197
05:21:54,230 --> 05:21:54,570
Yeah.

9198
05:21:54,850 --> 05:21:56,310
And then...

9199
05:21:56,310 --> 05:21:57,710
Put the string away.

9200
05:21:58,010 --> 05:21:59,310
I'll put the soul speed.

9201
05:22:00,070 --> 05:22:00,910
I'm taking a bite.

9202
05:22:02,810 --> 05:22:04,110
Do we need the boat?

9203
05:22:04,350 --> 05:22:05,330
Do we need it?

9204
05:22:05,390 --> 05:22:06,130
I'll put the boat.

9205
05:22:06,230 --> 05:22:07,030
Oh yeah, bring the boat.

9206
05:22:07,030 --> 05:22:08,270
Yeah, in case we fall.

9207
05:22:08,470 --> 05:22:09,430
Just in case we fall.

9208
05:22:16,230 --> 05:22:17,910
Put the charge.

9209
05:22:19,110 --> 05:22:20,690
I put the blast furnace.

9210
05:22:21,890 --> 05:22:23,390
I put away the obsidian.

9211
05:22:26,590 --> 05:22:27,830
I'm having mac and cheese.

9212
05:22:28,930 --> 05:22:30,210
Oh, that sounds nice.

9213
05:22:30,710 --> 05:22:31,670
I haven't had dinner yet.

9214
05:22:32,630 --> 05:22:32,950
No.

9215
05:22:33,650 --> 05:22:34,650
Let's have it later.

9216
05:22:34,650 --> 05:22:36,750
It's kind of late for dinner for me.

9217
05:22:37,290 --> 05:22:40,370
Oh yeah, you're not west coast.

9218
05:22:41,030 --> 05:22:41,290
Yeah.

9219
05:22:43,310 --> 05:22:44,450
What did I want to...

9220
05:22:44,450 --> 05:22:45,950
Oh, my brain is short circuiting.

9221
05:22:45,950 --> 05:22:46,870
Oh, I see the BB tower.

9222
05:22:47,730 --> 05:22:49,650
My brain isn't working anymore.

9223
05:22:49,750 --> 05:22:50,970
What did I want to make?

9224
05:22:51,210 --> 05:22:52,810
What did I want to make again?

9225
05:22:52,890 --> 05:22:53,230
Arrows?

9226
05:22:53,830 --> 05:22:55,390
No, I have the spectral arrows.

9227
05:22:55,750 --> 05:22:56,410
What did I...

9228
05:22:56,410 --> 05:22:58,250
What did I want to make?

9229
05:23:00,390 --> 05:23:00,830
Guys...

9230
05:23:00,830 --> 05:23:01,850
Guys, what was it?

9231
05:23:01,870 --> 05:23:02,790
I don't remember.

9232
05:23:02,790 --> 05:23:04,810
There's a lot of sheep around here.

9233
05:23:04,850 --> 05:23:06,390
So, I'm gonna murder them and make more food.

9234
05:23:07,350 --> 05:23:07,950
Oh, wait.

9235
05:23:08,110 --> 05:23:09,370
Gold, gold, gold bars.

9236
05:23:13,150 --> 05:23:14,450
Let's murder sheep.

9237
05:23:16,790 --> 05:23:17,310
Hippie...

9238
05:23:17,310 --> 05:23:18,610
Down with sheep.

9239
05:23:19,690 --> 05:23:20,870
Why are you already dying?

9240
05:23:21,690 --> 05:23:22,270
I'm ready.

9241
05:23:24,990 --> 05:23:27,110
What do you mean already dying?

9242
05:23:27,290 --> 05:23:27,890
Hold on.

9243
05:23:29,190 --> 05:23:30,730
I'm gonna put my stuff away first.

9244
05:23:31,410 --> 05:23:31,770
Alright.

9245
05:23:33,230 --> 05:23:34,230
You're not even here.

9246
05:23:34,970 --> 05:23:35,390
I am.

9247
05:23:36,070 --> 05:23:36,570
No, you're not.

9248
05:23:37,130 --> 05:23:37,790
I see you.

9249
05:23:38,650 --> 05:23:39,450
I don't see you.

9250
05:23:39,710 --> 05:23:40,530
Well, use your eyes.

9251
05:23:40,690 --> 05:23:42,530
Oh, I thought you meant like next to me.

9252
05:23:42,570 --> 05:23:43,750
Because you're like, I'm gonna put my stuff away.

9253
05:23:43,810 --> 05:23:44,990
I thought you're like at the chest.

9254
05:23:45,090 --> 05:23:45,690
Yeah, I'm here.

9255
05:23:45,930 --> 05:23:47,110
Okay, I'm putting my...

9256
05:23:47,110 --> 05:23:48,610
Wait, we're putting the lapis away, right?

9257
05:23:49,010 --> 05:23:49,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9258
05:23:49,950 --> 05:23:50,650
We don't need it now.

9259
05:23:52,350 --> 05:23:53,690
Oh, I guess I could've thrown that out.

9260
05:23:53,750 --> 05:23:54,030
Dang it.

9261
05:23:54,410 --> 05:23:55,990
Let's get some... Let's grab some food.

9262
05:23:56,050 --> 05:23:56,970
How much food do you have?

9263
05:23:57,430 --> 05:23:59,430
I have 30... I have a lot of hay.

9264
05:23:59,430 --> 05:24:01,790
But bread is not fast.

9265
05:24:01,890 --> 05:24:03,510
I think we need something faster than hay.

9266
05:24:04,410 --> 05:24:05,370
We're fine.

9267
05:24:07,010 --> 05:24:07,990
We need some...

9268
05:24:07,990 --> 05:24:08,010
Fine.

9269
05:24:08,230 --> 05:24:08,450
No!

9270
05:24:09,110 --> 05:24:09,750
It's fine.

9271
05:24:09,750 --> 05:24:10,390
I have golden carrots.

9272
05:24:10,730 --> 05:24:12,590
There's a bunch of sheep right here.

9273
05:24:12,770 --> 05:24:13,430
I have golden carrots.

9274
05:24:14,290 --> 05:24:15,730
I have golden carrots!

9275
05:24:16,310 --> 05:24:16,890
How many?

9276
05:24:17,890 --> 05:24:18,650
Enough for me.

9277
05:24:18,850 --> 05:24:19,710
Okay, that's you.

9278
05:24:19,870 --> 05:24:20,870
I only have...

9279
05:24:20,870 --> 05:24:22,870
I have lots of bread, but...

9280
05:24:22,870 --> 05:24:24,610
I need more substance.

9281
05:24:24,790 --> 05:24:25,770
I'm a growing girl.

9282
05:24:27,350 --> 05:24:28,470
I'm pretty sure you stopped growing.

9283
05:24:32,650 --> 05:24:34,670
Oh my God, I almost fell into this hole.

9284
05:24:34,850 --> 05:24:35,870
Be careful of holes.

9285
05:24:36,950 --> 05:24:38,170
Oh no, I'm gonna...

9286
05:24:42,370 --> 05:24:43,850
No response to that?

9287
05:24:52,670 --> 05:24:54,790
I'm taking my aggressions out on these sheep.

9288
05:24:57,150 --> 05:24:58,310
I'm gonna get a mod.

9289
05:24:58,310 --> 05:25:02,530
I'm gonna get my own resource pack where every sheep has a doki bird face on it.

9290
05:25:03,430 --> 05:25:06,190
There's a fucking Napoleon complex right there.

9291
05:25:06,410 --> 05:25:07,010
What?

9292
05:25:08,470 --> 05:25:13,470
Sorry, some of us are not born to be stretched out, you know?

9293
05:25:14,430 --> 05:25:15,610
Some of us...

9294
05:25:16,270 --> 05:25:19,130
Some of us had short moms and dads.

9295
05:25:19,310 --> 05:25:21,050
I'm 5'2".

9296
05:25:21,050 --> 05:25:22,310
What do you mean?

9297
05:25:23,530 --> 05:25:26,310
Wait, you're only 5'2".

9298
05:25:26,310 --> 05:25:28,750
And you're giving me shit.

9299
05:25:30,830 --> 05:25:33,490
I remember looking down.

9300
05:25:38,210 --> 05:25:42,730
I remember looking down, that's all I'm gonna say.

9301
05:25:45,330 --> 05:25:48,010
I won't stand this cylinder.

9302
05:25:48,610 --> 05:25:52,170
I'm gonna wear my tallest shoes when I see you.

9303
05:25:58,990 --> 05:26:00,810
Do you have the furnace?

9304
05:26:01,370 --> 05:26:03,510
Yeah, the blast furnace.

9305
05:26:03,770 --> 05:26:05,230
You want me to put it up now?

9306
05:26:05,350 --> 05:26:08,570
No, the blast furnace only works for...

9307
05:26:08,570 --> 05:26:11,250
It only works for...

9308
05:26:11,250 --> 05:26:11,870
What's it called?

9309
05:26:12,190 --> 05:26:13,270
I have leather too.

9310
05:26:13,690 --> 05:26:14,450
Put it in there.

9311
05:26:15,370 --> 05:26:16,110
Wanna use it?

9312
05:26:16,830 --> 05:26:17,490
For what?

9313
05:26:17,870 --> 05:26:18,590
Blast furnace.

9314
05:26:19,270 --> 05:26:21,550
I'm putting a blast furnace here just in case.

9315
05:26:21,730 --> 05:26:21,970
Okay.

9316
05:26:25,150 --> 05:26:27,090
Wait, does it not work on meat?

9317
05:26:27,290 --> 05:26:29,770
No, it only works on stuff.

9318
05:26:30,470 --> 05:26:32,370
Look, I took all... both...

9319
05:26:32,370 --> 05:26:34,490
Oh wait, no, there's another furnace here, I was gonna say.

9320
05:26:34,870 --> 05:26:35,610
I only took one.

9321
05:26:36,330 --> 05:26:36,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9322
05:26:37,670 --> 05:26:39,210
I'll put the meat in here too.

9323
05:26:45,310 --> 05:26:47,150
Oh, the furnace is so slow.

9324
05:26:52,770 --> 05:26:54,230
Is that furnace...

9325
05:26:54,230 --> 05:26:59,090
You can... Guys, this is not about how perfect the stacking is.

9326
05:26:59,190 --> 05:27:02,010
Like, you already saw my inventory, it's not great.

9327
05:27:04,210 --> 05:27:07,310
Yeah, we're here for survival, not style.

9328
05:27:07,350 --> 05:27:08,530
Yeah, this is survival.

9329
05:27:08,710 --> 05:27:10,110
I put the enderpearl away too.

9330
05:27:10,370 --> 05:27:10,710
Okay.

9331
05:27:14,130 --> 05:27:15,550
Oh, it bothers you?

9332
05:27:17,270 --> 05:27:19,190
Don't worry, I'll make it worse.

9333
05:27:21,910 --> 05:27:23,390
Yeah, you will.

9334
05:27:23,430 --> 05:27:26,090
I can make it... I can make it worse.

9335
05:27:27,190 --> 05:27:29,430
Oh my... Oh yeah, my gold.

9336
05:27:33,350 --> 05:27:33,870
Gold.

9337
05:27:34,790 --> 05:27:35,530
More gold.

9338
05:27:36,310 --> 05:27:36,610
Nice.

9339
05:27:36,750 --> 05:27:37,470
Gold, gold, gold.

9340
05:27:37,470 --> 05:27:39,110
How many gold nuggies do you have?

9341
05:27:39,430 --> 05:27:40,210
I have eight.

9342
05:27:40,470 --> 05:27:40,950
You have more?

9343
05:27:42,090 --> 05:27:43,290
I can make another gold bar.

9344
05:27:43,550 --> 05:27:43,910
There you go.

9345
05:27:52,910 --> 05:27:54,730
Okay, I have four bars now.

9346
05:27:54,910 --> 05:27:55,170
Okay.

9347
05:27:57,510 --> 05:27:58,030
Nice.

9348
05:27:59,490 --> 05:28:00,090
Oh, sorry.

9349
05:28:00,350 --> 05:28:00,790
Sorry, guys.

9350
05:28:01,130 --> 05:28:04,670
Oh my God, that sounded like... That sounded like the experience.

9351
05:28:04,950 --> 05:28:06,430
When you get the experience.

9352
05:28:11,570 --> 05:28:12,090
Alright.

9353
05:28:17,580 --> 05:28:18,780
One last meat.

9354
05:28:18,920 --> 05:28:19,880
Alright, nice.

9355
05:28:20,140 --> 05:28:20,820
Alright, I'm ready.

9356
05:28:21,840 --> 05:28:22,720
I'm ready to go to hell.

9357
05:28:23,160 --> 05:28:24,580
I'm ready.

9358
05:28:24,580 --> 05:28:24,860
Okay.

9359
05:28:24,940 --> 05:28:28,760
Oh my God, my... My helmet's not doing so hot, but...

9360
05:28:28,760 --> 05:28:29,660
What are we doing again?

9361
05:28:29,840 --> 05:28:30,840
Find the fortress, right?

9362
05:28:32,320 --> 05:28:32,740
Right?

9363
05:28:33,160 --> 05:28:33,900
Is that our goal?

9364
05:28:34,980 --> 05:28:35,400
Yes.

9365
05:28:36,940 --> 05:28:37,360
Alright.

9366
05:28:37,780 --> 05:28:39,260
I'm gonna make another shield.

9367
05:28:40,340 --> 05:28:42,640
Okay, what's the... Oh, my shield's okay.

9368
05:28:42,700 --> 05:28:43,640
I have not used it.

9369
05:28:44,200 --> 05:28:45,820
I'm just having one just in case.

9370
05:28:46,140 --> 05:28:50,140
Because, you know, it'll be a lot of blocking from the... What's it called as well?

9371
05:28:50,680 --> 05:28:51,400
And I'm gonna get some...

9372
05:28:51,400 --> 05:28:51,800
The gas?

9373
05:28:51,800 --> 05:28:52,880
Not the gas.

9374
05:28:53,100 --> 05:28:54,520
The blazes.

9375
05:28:55,440 --> 05:28:56,260
Oh, you're right.

9376
05:28:56,320 --> 05:28:56,840
You're right.

9377
05:28:57,400 --> 05:28:58,720
And I'm also gonna get some more...

9378
05:28:58,720 --> 05:28:59,420
Are you farming trees?

9379
05:28:59,720 --> 05:29:02,200
Yeah, I'm gonna get another tree so I can...

9380
05:29:02,200 --> 05:29:02,600
Alright.

9381
05:29:03,120 --> 05:29:04,460
I'm gonna wait here.

9382
05:29:04,480 --> 05:29:04,700
Yeah.

9383
05:29:05,260 --> 05:29:06,660
And contemplate my life.

9384
05:29:08,020 --> 05:29:08,460
Goodnight.

9385
05:29:09,200 --> 05:29:10,420
How did I get here?

9386
05:29:14,420 --> 05:29:14,900
Alright.

9387
05:29:16,920 --> 05:29:17,880
Alright, I'm ready.

9388
05:29:18,340 --> 05:29:21,460
You don't get burned if you block it with a shield?

9389
05:29:21,460 --> 05:29:22,940
I think so.

9390
05:29:23,120 --> 05:29:23,520
Yeah.

9391
05:29:23,740 --> 05:29:26,560
Unless they changed that in the update, but it didn't used to be that case.

9392
05:29:27,200 --> 05:29:27,500
That way?

9393
05:29:27,720 --> 05:29:27,940
I don't know.

9394
05:29:27,980 --> 05:29:29,680
It's been a while since we fought blazes.

9395
05:29:30,220 --> 05:29:30,600
I know.

9396
05:29:30,700 --> 05:29:32,100
Apparently, they've changed so much.

9397
05:29:32,900 --> 05:29:34,700
Yeah, I mean, they have camels now.

9398
05:29:35,920 --> 05:29:36,880
That's fucking wild.

9399
05:29:38,000 --> 05:29:40,300
Okay, well, I played during camels.

9400
05:29:41,340 --> 05:29:42,200
Oh, okay.

9401
05:29:42,400 --> 05:29:43,580
So you have no excuse.

9402
05:29:44,860 --> 05:29:47,520
What's some potions for the fire...

9403
05:29:47,520 --> 05:29:48,660
You have gold helmet?

9404
05:29:48,780 --> 05:29:48,960
Yes.

9405
05:29:49,160 --> 05:29:49,300
Nice.

9406
05:29:49,440 --> 05:29:49,640
Okay.

9407
05:29:49,640 --> 05:29:51,180
Fire resistance or what?

9408
05:29:51,920 --> 05:29:52,880
Gacha time!

9409
05:29:53,560 --> 05:29:54,660
Here's some gacha!

9410
05:29:56,140 --> 05:29:57,100
Gacha time!

9411
05:29:57,480 --> 05:29:59,280
This is a dangerous area to do gacha.

9412
05:29:59,800 --> 05:30:01,040
What are you gonna do?

9413
05:30:01,200 --> 05:30:01,800
Kill me?

9414
05:30:02,440 --> 05:30:03,320
Oh my god.

9415
05:30:03,500 --> 05:30:04,040
Here, gacha!

9416
05:30:04,960 --> 05:30:05,420
Gacha!

9417
05:30:07,700 --> 05:30:09,080
Got more arrows.

9418
05:30:10,980 --> 05:30:11,460
Gacha!

9419
05:30:12,460 --> 05:30:12,980
Nether wart?

9420
05:30:13,100 --> 05:30:14,060
Oh, I have a nether wart.

9421
05:30:14,640 --> 05:30:15,880
Oh no, sorry, I have wart fungus.

9422
05:30:16,140 --> 05:30:17,040
Oh, what's the nether wart?

9423
05:30:17,880 --> 05:30:19,340
Is that the brown ones?

9424
05:30:20,220 --> 05:30:21,100
Oh my god.

9425
05:30:21,120 --> 05:30:21,480
What did I get?

9426
05:30:21,940 --> 05:30:22,920
Is it soul speed again?

9427
05:30:22,960 --> 05:30:24,040
It's soul speed again.

9428
05:30:24,200 --> 05:30:24,980
God damn it.

9429
05:30:25,020 --> 05:30:25,440
What did he give me?

9430
05:30:25,660 --> 05:30:27,140
It's soul speed again.

9431
05:30:27,480 --> 05:30:28,000
Oh, what the hell?

9432
05:30:28,060 --> 05:30:29,240
He gave me a water bottle.

9433
05:30:29,340 --> 05:30:30,160
This guy sucks.

9434
05:30:31,460 --> 05:30:32,320
Oh, it's the red ones.

9435
05:30:32,340 --> 05:30:33,020
Stay hydrated!

9436
05:30:33,420 --> 05:30:34,960
Stay hydrated, guys!

9437
05:30:34,980 --> 05:30:35,280
Go ahead.

9438
05:30:35,300 --> 05:30:35,800
Thanks, guys.

9439
05:30:39,420 --> 05:30:40,120
And string!

9440
05:30:41,220 --> 05:30:42,280
He gave you string.

9441
05:30:42,460 --> 05:30:43,620
Yeah, and you're giving me string?

9442
05:30:43,760 --> 05:30:44,700
Okay, I'll take it.

9443
05:30:44,700 --> 05:30:46,720
That's literally the string he gave you.

9444
05:30:50,240 --> 05:30:51,200
Oh my god.

9445
05:30:51,660 --> 05:30:52,520
He gave you gravel.

9446
05:30:53,160 --> 05:30:53,600
Yeah.

9447
05:30:54,180 --> 05:30:55,420
Hold on, I have more.

9448
05:30:55,960 --> 05:30:56,460
Come on.

9449
05:30:57,340 --> 05:30:58,040
Come on.

9450
05:30:58,680 --> 05:30:59,760
Wait, did I take it?

9451
05:30:59,800 --> 05:31:00,440
Let's go gambling.

9452
05:31:00,860 --> 05:31:02,160
Did you take it or did I take it?

9453
05:31:02,180 --> 05:31:03,320
No, you took it.

9454
05:31:04,260 --> 05:31:05,280
Let's go gambling.

9455
05:31:05,280 --> 05:31:06,020
Let's go gambling.

9456
05:31:06,420 --> 05:31:07,740
Pig snorts enviously.

9457
05:31:08,580 --> 05:31:10,820
Well, yeah, to be fair, water is rare in the nether.

9458
05:31:11,220 --> 05:31:12,280
That's like his diamond.

9459
05:31:14,000 --> 05:31:14,880
Oh, true.

9460
05:31:15,340 --> 05:31:15,720
There's two.

9461
05:31:15,840 --> 05:31:17,040
You can give both of them.

9462
05:31:17,300 --> 05:31:18,080
Come here, guys.

9463
05:31:18,120 --> 05:31:18,360
At the same time.

9464
05:31:21,860 --> 05:31:22,580
Come on.

9465
05:31:23,060 --> 05:31:24,180
Oh, he gave me a fire charge.

9466
05:31:24,420 --> 05:31:25,620
A double whammy.

9467
05:31:27,360 --> 05:31:28,040
Oh my god.

9468
05:31:28,040 --> 05:31:29,520
I got leather at least.

9469
05:31:30,040 --> 05:31:30,800
Oh, that's good.

9470
05:31:32,300 --> 05:31:32,740
Come here.

9471
05:31:32,740 --> 05:31:33,400
You have more gold?

9472
05:31:33,860 --> 05:31:34,380
Come here.

9473
05:31:34,640 --> 05:31:35,620
Oh, that's not what I meant.

9474
05:31:35,720 --> 05:31:36,560
Yeah, I have three more.

9475
05:31:36,740 --> 05:31:37,040
Come here.

9476
05:31:38,320 --> 05:31:39,220
Throw another one.

9477
05:31:39,280 --> 05:31:39,960
They're greedy.

9478
05:31:40,120 --> 05:31:40,640
They're greedy.

9479
05:31:40,640 --> 05:31:41,120
They're greedy.

9480
05:31:42,520 --> 05:31:43,320
Oh my god.

9481
05:31:43,320 --> 05:31:44,920
Oh sh...

9482
05:31:48,700 --> 05:31:49,660
I missed.

9483
05:31:50,260 --> 05:31:51,800
I know, it's really easy to miss.

9484
05:31:52,320 --> 05:31:53,180
Oh my god.

9485
05:31:54,940 --> 05:31:56,060
What the fuck?

9486
05:31:56,140 --> 05:31:57,340
What's the drop off?

9487
05:31:58,300 --> 05:31:58,860
Oh my god.

9488
05:32:00,240 --> 05:32:01,380
What's the drop?

9489
05:32:02,680 --> 05:32:03,560
Okay, there you go.

9490
05:32:03,560 --> 05:32:04,020
I got it.

9491
05:32:05,220 --> 05:32:06,800
Okay, I figured out the drop off.

9492
05:32:06,880 --> 05:32:07,720
I figured it out.

9493
05:32:07,800 --> 05:32:08,800
I figured it out.

9494
05:32:08,800 --> 05:32:12,100
I don't even know what they gave us.

9495
05:32:12,400 --> 05:32:14,320
I figured out the drop off.

9496
05:32:14,940 --> 05:32:16,140
Blackstone and gravel.

9497
05:32:17,620 --> 05:32:18,260
Oh, okay.

9498
05:32:18,660 --> 05:32:19,520
Because I got it.

9499
05:32:24,640 --> 05:32:26,840
I'm throwing it away.

9500
05:32:28,780 --> 05:32:29,220
Okay.

9501
05:32:30,540 --> 05:32:32,560
Let's find this fucking stupid fortress.

9502
05:32:33,160 --> 05:32:33,420
Okay.

9503
05:32:34,080 --> 05:32:35,280
Alright, you lead.

9504
05:32:35,680 --> 05:32:36,000
Me?

9505
05:32:36,980 --> 05:32:37,340
Yes.

9506
05:32:38,580 --> 05:32:39,220
Okay, hold on.

9507
05:32:41,360 --> 05:32:43,700
Yes, because if we die, I can blame it on you.

9508
05:32:43,800 --> 05:32:45,440
Sure, I knew that would be the case.

9509
05:32:46,000 --> 05:32:46,360
Yeah.

9510
05:32:47,140 --> 05:32:48,120
It's good that you know.

9511
05:32:48,260 --> 05:32:51,060
Wait, so these are the ones that we need, right?

9512
05:32:51,120 --> 05:32:51,720
Are these the ones?

9513
05:32:52,680 --> 05:32:54,240
They are red mushrooms.

9514
05:32:54,460 --> 05:32:54,820
No, they're not.

9515
05:32:54,900 --> 05:32:55,540
They're red mushrooms.

9516
05:32:55,700 --> 05:32:56,720
He's shooting at us.

9517
05:32:57,380 --> 05:32:57,740
Where?

9518
05:32:59,900 --> 05:33:01,100
I don't even see the guy.

9519
05:33:01,120 --> 05:33:01,580
Just go up.

9520
05:33:01,840 --> 05:33:02,680
He's right behind you.

9521
05:33:03,980 --> 05:33:05,160
He's right behind you.

9522
05:33:05,160 --> 05:33:05,420
It's fine.

9523
05:33:05,520 --> 05:33:06,260
Let's just go.

9524
05:33:07,580 --> 05:33:08,000
Oh my god.

9525
05:33:08,360 --> 05:33:09,580
This area sucks.

9526
05:33:13,200 --> 05:33:14,600
Alright, I'm climbing up.

9527
05:33:14,740 --> 05:33:15,080
Me too.

9528
05:33:17,680 --> 05:33:18,880
What about these ones?

9529
05:33:20,560 --> 05:33:21,640
Those are the mushrooms?

9530
05:33:22,460 --> 05:33:23,560
Oh, they're not the mushrooms.

9531
05:33:23,660 --> 05:33:24,260
I'm confused.

9532
05:33:25,460 --> 05:33:26,100
What the?

9533
05:33:27,480 --> 05:33:28,360
I fucked up.

9534
05:33:32,090 --> 05:33:33,050
I fucked up.

9535
05:33:34,170 --> 05:33:35,570
I can't help you.

9536
05:33:36,250 --> 05:33:37,450
Is he following me?

9537
05:33:37,610 --> 05:33:38,190
Yes, he is.

9538
05:33:39,770 --> 05:33:41,070
Oh, I'm so sorry.

9539
05:33:41,830 --> 05:33:42,970
He stopped.

9540
05:33:43,170 --> 05:33:43,330
He stopped.

9541
05:33:46,630 --> 05:33:48,010
Let's just keep going, I guess.

9542
05:33:48,370 --> 05:33:49,630
It was just a prank, bro.

9543
05:33:50,110 --> 05:33:51,970
It was just a prank, bro.

9544
05:33:52,830 --> 05:33:54,410
I'm sorry, bro.

9545
05:33:55,990 --> 05:33:57,150
This is so bad.

9546
05:33:57,270 --> 05:33:59,490
What's the easiest way to find a fortress, you guys?

9547
05:33:59,610 --> 05:34:00,650
There's no easy way.

9548
05:34:01,010 --> 05:34:02,270
There's no easy way.

9549
05:34:02,270 --> 05:34:02,710
No!

9550
05:34:03,990 --> 05:34:05,050
We just go.

9551
05:34:05,330 --> 05:34:06,550
Wait, is he still angry?

9552
05:34:07,010 --> 05:34:08,350
What did I do to you?

9553
05:34:08,650 --> 05:34:09,730
Did you take his gold?

9554
05:34:10,530 --> 05:34:10,970
No.

9555
05:34:11,530 --> 05:34:13,070
Let's just dig through here.

9556
05:34:14,470 --> 05:34:15,030
No.

9557
05:34:15,830 --> 05:34:16,650
You get lucky.

9558
05:34:16,970 --> 05:34:17,570
This sucks.

9559
05:34:19,110 --> 05:34:20,750
It's all about luck, isn't it?

9560
05:34:20,930 --> 05:34:21,590
I think so.

9561
05:34:23,330 --> 05:34:25,670
I'm putting a thing here.

9562
05:34:26,570 --> 05:34:27,430
Oh my god.

9563
05:34:27,890 --> 05:34:28,770
I hear him.

9564
05:34:28,770 --> 05:34:29,350
Yeah, go in.

9565
05:34:29,510 --> 05:34:29,690
Go in.

9566
05:34:31,950 --> 05:34:33,290
Dig into lava.

9567
05:34:34,490 --> 05:34:35,270
We don't do that.

9568
05:34:35,570 --> 05:34:36,970
We be very careful.

9569
05:34:37,650 --> 05:34:38,750
We keep our distance.

9570
05:34:39,110 --> 05:34:39,870
We keep our distance.

9571
05:34:40,270 --> 05:34:42,430
But what if I'm not lucky?

9572
05:34:43,650 --> 05:34:44,570
Where are you going?

9573
05:34:45,790 --> 05:34:46,250
Gold.

9574
05:34:47,130 --> 05:34:47,810
Oh my god.

9575
05:34:49,430 --> 05:34:50,210
He doesn't know.

9576
05:34:51,110 --> 05:34:53,230
Well, he's already aggroed, so even if he didn't know...

9577
05:34:53,230 --> 05:34:53,690
How does he know?

9578
05:34:54,510 --> 05:34:55,250
How does he know?

9579
05:34:55,370 --> 05:34:56,250
Do I have to go up?

9580
05:34:56,250 --> 05:34:57,450
Go up?

9581
05:34:57,850 --> 05:34:59,110
Yeah, because it's a mountain.

9582
05:35:00,510 --> 05:35:01,290
Wait, what's first?

9583
05:35:01,310 --> 05:35:01,810
It's a mountain.

9584
05:35:03,530 --> 05:35:04,170
I saw it.

9585
05:35:04,250 --> 05:35:04,850
We have to go up.

9586
05:35:05,070 --> 05:35:06,550
I don't think we have to go up.

9587
05:35:06,710 --> 05:35:08,250
I just went across.

9588
05:35:09,130 --> 05:35:09,970
I'm digging up.

9589
05:35:10,050 --> 05:35:10,990
You can go across.

9590
05:35:11,070 --> 05:35:11,750
I dig up.

9591
05:35:12,610 --> 05:35:13,230
Don't dig up.

9592
05:35:13,410 --> 05:35:13,870
Don't dig up.

9593
05:35:13,970 --> 05:35:14,550
Don't dig up.

9594
05:35:14,650 --> 05:35:15,270
Don't dig up.

9595
05:35:15,810 --> 05:35:16,770
It's a full lava.

9596
05:35:18,770 --> 05:35:19,430
It's full.

9597
05:35:21,630 --> 05:35:22,030
Wow.

9598
05:35:30,110 --> 05:35:30,590
Wow.

9599
05:35:33,690 --> 05:35:35,090
What a thunk.

9600
05:35:37,710 --> 05:35:40,470
I thought it was...

9601
05:35:40,470 --> 05:35:41,170
I don't know.

9602
05:35:41,330 --> 05:35:42,690
I thought it was a mountain.

9603
05:35:43,050 --> 05:35:44,370
I thought it was a...

9604
05:35:44,370 --> 05:35:45,430
Why are you down here?

9605
05:35:46,210 --> 05:35:47,270
Because we're going through.

9606
05:35:48,470 --> 05:35:48,830
Okay.

9607
05:35:49,030 --> 05:35:49,290
Hold on.

9608
05:35:50,290 --> 05:35:51,890
I learned my lesson from before.

9609
05:35:53,030 --> 05:35:53,810
I learned my lesson.

9610
05:35:53,910 --> 05:35:54,210
Hold on.

9611
05:35:54,770 --> 05:35:55,130
Wait.

9612
05:35:56,070 --> 05:35:56,470
Do you have...

9613
05:35:56,470 --> 05:35:57,150
Do you have nuggies?

9614
05:35:57,230 --> 05:35:57,550
You grab them.

9615
05:35:59,830 --> 05:36:00,930
I learned my lesson.

9616
05:36:02,130 --> 05:36:02,490
Okay.

9617
05:36:03,050 --> 05:36:04,130
Let's just keep going this way.

9618
05:36:04,370 --> 05:36:06,610
Because we're about to get to another soul area.

9619
05:36:06,850 --> 05:36:07,770
So it might be in here.

9620
05:36:08,710 --> 05:36:09,670
I heard like gas.

9621
05:36:10,630 --> 05:36:11,170
Hold on.

9622
05:36:11,270 --> 05:36:12,450
I'm gonna put...

9623
05:36:12,450 --> 05:36:13,370
some torches down.

9624
05:36:14,850 --> 05:36:16,510
As a way to find our way home.

9625
05:36:18,310 --> 05:36:19,250
What's that sound?

9626
05:36:19,710 --> 05:36:20,470
Is that gas?

9627
05:36:20,470 --> 05:36:21,430
The meowing?

9628
05:36:21,550 --> 05:36:22,310
Yeah, it's a gas.

9629
05:36:24,950 --> 05:36:26,150
Yeah, that's what he does.

9630
05:36:26,250 --> 05:36:26,750
Nasty.

9631
05:36:28,250 --> 05:36:30,650
Imagine him being all filled with skin.

9632
05:36:32,490 --> 05:36:34,210
The skin and like...

9633
05:36:34,210 --> 05:36:35,850
little hairs coming out too.

9634
05:36:36,650 --> 05:36:36,930
Wait.

9635
05:36:36,990 --> 05:36:37,870
Where is my...

9636
05:36:38,350 --> 05:36:39,690
Where is my hole?

9637
05:36:39,690 --> 05:36:40,850
How did you get over there?

9638
05:36:41,050 --> 05:36:42,310
This is where my hole is at.

9639
05:36:44,210 --> 05:36:44,930
Hold on.

9640
05:36:45,010 --> 05:36:46,810
Hold on.

9641
05:36:46,870 --> 05:36:47,630
Don't follow me.

9642
05:36:49,130 --> 05:36:50,150
It's too late.

9643
05:36:50,410 --> 05:36:51,530
I'm gonna not listen.

9644
05:36:51,870 --> 05:36:53,570
We're going down through here.

9645
05:36:56,370 --> 05:36:58,050
We're going through here.

9646
05:37:01,890 --> 05:37:03,310
What if I dig up again?

9647
05:37:03,710 --> 05:37:04,610
You could die.

9648
05:37:05,610 --> 05:37:06,290
Do you want to try?

9649
05:37:06,330 --> 05:37:07,470
Wouldn't that be a shame?

9650
05:37:08,670 --> 05:37:09,930
It sounds like...

9651
05:37:09,930 --> 05:37:11,370
you want to not do this.

9652
05:37:11,630 --> 05:37:13,670
Or rather, you want to do this forever.

9653
05:37:18,710 --> 05:37:19,190
Nooooo.

9654
05:37:19,950 --> 05:37:20,530
Look at that.

9655
05:37:21,530 --> 05:37:22,010
Nooooo.

9656
05:37:22,590 --> 05:37:25,210
It took us 5 hours to get to this point.

9657
05:37:25,290 --> 05:37:27,090
I don't know how many hours it's gonna take us.

9658
05:37:27,090 --> 05:37:29,630
This is why it took other people literally...

9659
05:37:30,810 --> 05:37:31,550
20 days.

9660
05:37:31,910 --> 05:37:32,890
20 days.

9661
05:37:33,290 --> 05:37:34,610
Oh, I'm in the soul sand.

9662
05:37:35,010 --> 05:37:36,010
This might be good.

9663
05:37:36,630 --> 05:37:37,590
Oh, I hear a gas.

9664
05:37:37,650 --> 05:37:38,450
Nevermind, that's not good.

9665
05:37:39,290 --> 05:37:40,150
We can fight him.

9666
05:37:40,510 --> 05:37:41,430
He'll disappear eventually.

9667
05:37:43,130 --> 05:37:43,950
Oh my god.

9668
05:37:44,510 --> 05:37:45,850
I hate them.

9669
05:37:51,350 --> 05:37:52,610
Where is he?

9670
05:37:53,030 --> 05:37:54,210
Oh, there's the bones.

9671
05:37:54,470 --> 05:37:55,870
Look at all these bones.

9672
05:37:56,370 --> 05:37:57,370
Yeah, we're in the bone zone.

9673
05:38:02,970 --> 05:38:04,630
Who the fuck is this guy?

9674
05:38:05,250 --> 05:38:05,910
I don't know.

9675
05:38:06,150 --> 05:38:08,210
I hear him, but I don't see him anyway.

9676
05:38:08,470 --> 05:38:09,450
He might be above us.

9677
05:38:13,970 --> 05:38:15,830
I don't want to leave until he's gone though.

9678
05:38:19,300 --> 05:38:21,420
I don't think he's gonna go away.

9679
05:38:25,730 --> 05:38:26,910
Alright, my shield.

9680
05:38:33,760 --> 05:38:34,980
We're in the bone zone.

9681
05:38:34,980 --> 05:38:35,840
I don't hear them anymore.

9682
05:38:36,080 --> 05:38:36,620
I don't either.

9683
05:38:36,920 --> 05:38:37,480
I think we're good.

9684
05:38:38,080 --> 05:38:39,320
Can we go down?

9685
05:38:40,500 --> 05:38:40,900
Yeah.

9686
05:38:41,680 --> 05:38:42,040
Oh god.

9687
05:38:43,700 --> 05:38:44,260
No.

9688
05:38:44,740 --> 05:38:48,080
We can build a ladder.

9689
05:38:49,920 --> 05:38:50,480
Staircase.

9690
05:38:51,640 --> 05:38:52,300
I'm gonna try.

9691
05:38:56,520 --> 05:38:57,140
Hold on.

9692
05:38:58,280 --> 05:38:58,940
There we go.

9693
05:38:59,080 --> 05:39:00,040
Okay, we can start from here.

9694
05:39:01,140 --> 05:39:01,700
Oh, okay.

9695
05:39:01,740 --> 05:39:02,500
We'll start from here.

9696
05:39:02,620 --> 05:39:04,860
I was already making my own, but okay.

9697
05:39:04,860 --> 05:39:05,200
Just kidding.

9698
05:39:05,960 --> 05:39:07,080
Alright, that's fine.

9699
05:39:11,390 --> 05:39:12,010
Don't you know what?

9700
05:39:12,630 --> 05:39:14,490
This is why you don't dig underneath you.

9701
05:39:20,910 --> 05:39:22,470
Did you see the gas?

9702
05:39:23,270 --> 05:39:23,670
No.

9703
05:39:23,670 --> 05:39:26,050
Just have your shield ready.

9704
05:39:26,850 --> 05:39:27,490
No.

9705
05:39:29,230 --> 05:39:31,430
I don't see him.

9706
05:39:31,470 --> 05:39:34,310
Have your shield ready for bone zones as well.

9707
05:39:34,430 --> 05:39:35,250
For bony fellas.

9708
05:39:36,290 --> 05:39:38,630
I learn sometimes, chat.

9709
05:39:39,350 --> 05:39:41,790
Bony fellas are on the...

9710
05:39:41,790 --> 05:39:43,150
I think he's actually above us.

9711
05:39:43,390 --> 05:39:44,510
Because I don't see him anywhere.

9712
05:39:44,790 --> 05:39:45,350
Hold on.

9713
05:39:45,550 --> 05:39:49,230
I want to put another torch here.

9714
05:39:49,530 --> 05:39:49,910
Oh!

9715
05:39:50,050 --> 05:39:51,070
Oh my god, double.

9716
05:39:51,070 --> 05:39:51,990
That's double?

9717
05:39:52,210 --> 05:39:53,150
That's so messed up.

9718
05:39:55,070 --> 05:39:55,910
Oh, I see him.

9719
05:39:56,070 --> 05:39:57,130
He's above us.

9720
05:39:57,470 --> 05:39:58,450
I knew it.

9721
05:39:58,830 --> 05:40:01,390
Oh, are these the...

9722
05:40:01,390 --> 05:40:02,370
Where are these?

9723
05:40:02,930 --> 05:40:04,070
I don't know where you are.

9724
05:40:04,830 --> 05:40:05,350
What are what?

9725
05:40:05,570 --> 05:40:06,890
Oh, they're the crimson roots.

9726
05:40:08,890 --> 05:40:09,730
Where are they?

9727
05:40:09,810 --> 05:40:11,730
There's so many white stuff above us.

9728
05:40:12,530 --> 05:40:14,730
I can't tell what is actually...

9729
05:40:14,730 --> 05:40:16,030
How do you not see them?

9730
05:40:16,530 --> 05:40:17,690
I don't see them.

9731
05:40:17,690 --> 05:40:18,710
I don't know where you are.

9732
05:40:18,830 --> 05:40:19,350
Where'd you go?

9733
05:40:19,950 --> 05:40:20,590
I went straight.

9734
05:40:21,030 --> 05:40:21,530
I see you.

9735
05:40:21,630 --> 05:40:22,170
Look, I'm here.

9736
05:40:22,250 --> 05:40:22,430
I'm here.

9737
05:40:28,070 --> 05:40:30,050
We can't run in this area.

9738
05:40:31,730 --> 05:40:32,490
That's right.

9739
05:40:32,630 --> 05:40:33,090
I'm better.

9740
05:40:34,090 --> 05:40:35,890
I know the drop off.

9741
05:40:36,130 --> 05:40:38,310
I know the drop off now.

9742
05:40:39,170 --> 05:40:40,650
That's fucking right, guys.

9743
05:40:42,470 --> 05:40:44,290
I know the drop off.

9744
05:40:44,570 --> 05:40:46,190
It only took me...

9745
05:40:46,190 --> 05:40:47,390
A little bit.

9746
05:40:47,390 --> 05:40:48,250
A little bit.

9747
05:40:48,770 --> 05:40:50,210
It took me a little bit to learn.

9748
05:40:50,510 --> 05:40:51,210
The sand sucks.

9749
05:40:51,990 --> 05:40:52,590
Yeah, it does.

9750
05:40:52,630 --> 05:40:53,690
I'm gonna get the gold here though.

9751
05:40:57,090 --> 05:40:58,690
Get over here.

9752
05:40:59,730 --> 05:41:01,010
Get over here.

9753
05:41:03,390 --> 05:41:04,950
Run, run, run, run, run.

9754
05:41:05,250 --> 05:41:05,790
Oh my God.

9755
05:41:08,830 --> 05:41:10,070
That didn't help much.

9756
05:41:10,990 --> 05:41:12,530
That's a lot of lava.

9757
05:41:13,030 --> 05:41:14,410
It just keeps going.

9758
05:41:15,050 --> 05:41:18,130
You literally find one single thing.

9759
05:41:19,450 --> 05:41:21,430
That was such bait.

9760
05:41:23,570 --> 05:41:27,350
Yay, gold time.

9761
05:41:29,030 --> 05:41:31,490
I put one block in attempt to help.

9762
05:41:33,110 --> 05:41:35,750
Oh yeah, I can see that one block helping.

9763
05:41:36,030 --> 05:41:38,990
I was gonna do more, but it started coming out.

9764
05:41:39,110 --> 05:41:40,950
It started flowing faster than I expected.

9765
05:41:42,130 --> 05:41:42,910
What am I doing?

9766
05:41:43,030 --> 05:41:44,530
I just wanted the gold.

9767
05:41:44,770 --> 05:41:45,930
What am I doing?

9768
05:41:45,930 --> 05:41:46,590
Be careful.

9769
05:41:48,130 --> 05:41:49,070
Let's go back up.

9770
05:41:49,550 --> 05:41:50,970
Oh, there's one more gold here.

9771
05:41:51,370 --> 05:41:56,110
I made a ladder over here.

9772
05:41:57,890 --> 05:41:59,350
We can go from here.

9773
05:41:59,930 --> 05:42:01,810
We don't need the bones for anything, right?

9774
05:42:03,090 --> 05:42:04,550
I don't think so.

9775
05:42:04,870 --> 05:42:06,410
I wanna see if I can get a dog.

9776
05:42:08,090 --> 05:42:08,750
I'll grab one.

9777
05:42:10,010 --> 05:42:11,770
Oh wait, I already have... I'll grab one.

9778
05:42:13,110 --> 05:42:14,530
Oh no, that's for bone meal.

9779
05:42:14,530 --> 05:42:15,830
I don't fucking need that.

9780
05:42:16,070 --> 05:42:19,170
Oh yeah, you can't turn the big bones into bone bone.

9781
05:42:21,030 --> 05:42:23,010
But what about bone town?

9782
05:42:23,230 --> 05:42:24,070
Hold on, I need that.

9783
05:42:24,070 --> 05:42:25,930
How am I gonna get to bone town?

9784
05:42:28,870 --> 05:42:30,070
Wait, how do we get down?

9785
05:42:32,850 --> 05:42:34,070
I don't know.

9786
05:42:36,210 --> 05:42:37,330
Wait, there's a fortress?

9787
05:42:37,870 --> 05:42:38,210
Where?

9788
05:42:39,850 --> 05:42:40,690
Is that it?

9789
05:42:41,050 --> 05:42:41,910
Is that a fortress?

9790
05:42:41,910 --> 05:42:42,030
Is that a fortress?

9791
05:42:43,770 --> 05:42:45,030
Oh, you could use the bow.

9792
05:42:45,210 --> 05:42:46,090
Wait, we have the bow.

9793
05:42:46,550 --> 05:42:47,370
Oh, you're right.

9794
05:42:47,850 --> 05:42:49,090
Use the bow, use the bow.

9795
05:42:52,150 --> 05:42:53,730
It won't sing, I'm blind.

9796
05:42:54,670 --> 05:42:56,170
Where below is this fire?

9797
05:42:56,570 --> 05:42:57,050
Can you check?

9798
05:42:57,230 --> 05:42:58,030
Wait, is...

9799
05:42:59,050 --> 05:43:00,190
We're good, we're good, we're good.

9800
05:43:04,010 --> 05:43:05,590
Alright, nice.

9801
05:43:08,050 --> 05:43:09,790
Oh, we got one guy, nevermind.

9802
05:43:09,790 --> 05:43:11,150
Oh, come on!

9803
05:43:12,010 --> 05:43:13,830
Nevermind, I just saw somebody be like...

9804
05:43:14,450 --> 05:43:15,690
Can't believe she's blind.

9805
05:43:15,750 --> 05:43:17,910
And then another guy was like, there's a fortress!

9806
05:43:18,110 --> 05:43:19,110
So I was like, oh, what?

9807
05:43:20,230 --> 05:43:21,250
Did we get one guy?

9808
05:43:21,490 --> 05:43:24,230
Oh, I see this magma cube that's just stuck floating in space.

9809
05:43:24,250 --> 05:43:24,910
Yeah, but it's so far.

9810
05:43:27,130 --> 05:43:28,450
I'm just gonna head straight.

9811
05:43:29,850 --> 05:43:31,050
Just gotta get lucky.

9812
05:43:32,070 --> 05:43:33,790
Wouldn't be fucked up if like...

9813
05:43:34,570 --> 05:43:35,050
Uh...

9814
05:43:35,050 --> 05:43:37,330
The fortress was like literally the other direction.

9815
05:43:38,030 --> 05:43:39,650
Yeah, that'd be kinda messed up.

9816
05:43:39,890 --> 05:43:41,470
That'd be so messed up.

9817
05:43:41,610 --> 05:43:42,550
Yeah, that would kinda suck.

9818
05:43:42,990 --> 05:43:44,630
Yeah, that would really suck, guys.

9819
05:43:45,130 --> 05:43:46,370
Oh, there's a Ghastly.

9820
05:43:47,170 --> 05:43:48,370
No, why are they...

9821
05:43:48,370 --> 05:43:49,530
Why do they spawn everywhere?

9822
05:43:50,310 --> 05:43:53,830
I feel like the new update made them spawn...

9823
05:43:53,830 --> 05:43:54,590
Wait, what?

9824
05:43:54,710 --> 05:43:55,450
That should've hit.

9825
05:43:57,570 --> 05:43:58,530
Sometimes it's...

9826
05:43:58,530 --> 05:43:59,590
Oh, yeah, it's hidden.

9827
05:44:01,470 --> 05:44:01,950
Oh, shoot.

9828
05:44:02,250 --> 05:44:02,510
Why?

9829
05:44:02,510 --> 05:44:02,530
Why?

9830
05:44:02,810 --> 05:44:05,350
Oh my God.

9831
05:44:05,450 --> 05:44:05,910
You got him?

9832
05:44:06,410 --> 05:44:07,730
Oh, you got him.

9833
05:44:07,990 --> 05:44:11,690
Oh my God, I almost fell in there too.

9834
05:44:13,190 --> 05:44:13,670
Holy...

9835
05:44:13,670 --> 05:44:15,530
Oh my God.

9836
05:44:16,230 --> 05:44:17,510
Oh, I almost went back.

9837
05:44:17,590 --> 05:44:18,670
Don't do it.

9838
05:44:19,270 --> 05:44:20,790
I almost jumped back in there.

9839
05:44:20,790 --> 05:44:22,470
There's a Skelly in there too.

9840
05:44:22,790 --> 05:44:25,090
I felt extra wild today.

9841
05:44:26,670 --> 05:44:27,550
Only today.

9842
05:44:27,730 --> 05:44:28,890
Hold on, I'm gonna go check this area.

9843
05:44:28,890 --> 05:44:30,090
I'm gonna see if there's like...

9844
05:44:30,090 --> 05:44:32,130
Maybe a fortress.

9845
05:44:36,460 --> 05:44:37,360
I don't see it.

9846
05:44:37,360 --> 05:44:40,040
I could've closed that hole up, but I decided not to.

9847
05:44:40,460 --> 05:44:41,560
You're living on the edge.

9848
05:44:42,300 --> 05:44:43,880
I feel extra crazy.

9849
05:44:44,120 --> 05:44:46,600
Oh my God, she's crazy.

9850
05:44:46,980 --> 05:44:47,880
She's wild.

9851
05:44:48,360 --> 05:44:51,200
She's gonna do something wild, guys.

9852
05:44:55,420 --> 05:44:57,500
I think this is the worst part.

9853
05:44:58,660 --> 05:44:59,620
Trying to find...

9854
05:45:00,680 --> 05:45:01,300
The fortress?

9855
05:45:01,660 --> 05:45:01,960
Yeah.

9856
05:45:03,100 --> 05:45:04,940
How do people... How do speedrunners do it?

9857
05:45:06,360 --> 05:45:07,740
They just get lucky, I think.

9858
05:45:07,820 --> 05:45:08,260
Are you firing?

9859
05:45:08,400 --> 05:45:09,660
Oh, I see what you're going for.

9860
05:45:11,740 --> 05:45:15,560
Yeah, because I didn't want him to fucking shoot his arrow and I go...

9861
05:45:15,560 --> 05:45:16,440
Set C.

9862
05:45:16,980 --> 05:45:18,180
No, that's so boring.

9863
05:45:19,180 --> 05:45:19,620
Yeah.

9864
05:45:20,400 --> 05:45:22,300
Some of them don't do set C.

9865
05:45:22,380 --> 05:45:26,360
I think they like reset over and over again until like...

9866
05:45:26,360 --> 05:45:28,200
Oh, they know what they're getting.

9867
05:45:28,920 --> 05:45:30,240
Or like, they get a good thing.

9868
05:45:30,820 --> 05:45:31,160
Yeah.

9869
05:45:32,760 --> 05:45:33,420
I'm good.

9870
05:45:34,860 --> 05:45:36,180
I mean, that's what speedrunners do.

9871
05:45:36,220 --> 05:45:38,580
They do it like a million different times until it works.

9872
05:45:39,160 --> 05:45:39,500
Yeah.

9873
05:45:39,620 --> 05:45:40,300
Do you have more arrows?

9874
05:45:41,060 --> 05:45:42,580
Yeah, I have spectral arrows.

9875
05:45:42,700 --> 05:45:43,040
Do you want them?

9876
05:45:43,480 --> 05:45:45,020
Yeah, I'll take some.

9877
05:45:45,220 --> 05:45:46,320
Oh, there's another ghast over there?

9878
05:45:46,560 --> 05:45:47,380
Yeah, that's why...

9879
05:45:49,480 --> 05:45:50,280
Come here.

9880
05:45:50,940 --> 05:45:51,860
Right there.

9881
05:45:51,860 --> 05:45:51,900
Yeah.

9882
05:45:54,400 --> 05:45:54,920
Alright.

9883
05:45:55,180 --> 05:45:56,380
I'm gonna eat some food.

9884
05:45:57,580 --> 05:45:58,660
Oh, IRL?

9885
05:45:58,980 --> 05:45:59,220
Yeah.

9886
05:46:02,880 --> 05:46:06,000
Holy shit, there's so many soul sand.

9887
05:46:06,520 --> 05:46:08,140
Oh my god, how are we gonna get it?

9888
05:46:08,180 --> 05:46:09,980
Oh, this is so scary to get across.

9889
05:46:10,200 --> 05:46:11,360
It's literally lava.

9890
05:46:11,700 --> 05:46:13,340
Straight up lava on the other side.

9891
05:46:13,540 --> 05:46:13,900
Oh.

9892
05:46:14,380 --> 05:46:15,960
I don't know if we should cross that.

9893
05:46:17,360 --> 05:46:19,080
I don't know, it's a little dangerous.

9894
05:46:20,920 --> 05:46:22,820
With ghasts spawning, I wouldn't.

9895
05:46:24,320 --> 05:46:25,760
Yeah, so where should we go then?

9896
05:46:26,260 --> 05:46:27,160
I don't know.

9897
05:46:27,280 --> 05:46:27,940
Oh, I think we...

9898
05:46:27,940 --> 05:46:28,620
Through the walls.

9899
05:46:30,140 --> 05:46:32,300
I feel like maybe that direction, the right side?

9900
05:46:33,420 --> 05:46:34,580
That's the way we came from.

9901
05:46:35,020 --> 05:46:35,540
Isn't that?

9902
05:46:35,660 --> 05:46:37,000
I thought we came from the back.

9903
05:46:39,380 --> 05:46:41,000
I don't remember where we came from.

9904
05:46:41,200 --> 05:46:43,500
Like, I think if we just dig this way...

9905
05:46:43,500 --> 05:46:43,840
Alright.

9906
05:46:43,840 --> 05:46:43,940
Alright.

9907
05:46:46,460 --> 05:46:48,120
We can just dig on through.

9908
05:46:49,540 --> 05:46:52,160
I was like, it would be silly to make a bridge across.

9909
05:46:52,260 --> 05:46:53,220
Yeah, it would be pretty silly.

9910
05:46:54,120 --> 05:46:56,920
It would be so silly if we did that.

9911
05:46:57,100 --> 05:46:57,380
Yeah.

9912
05:46:57,640 --> 05:46:58,280
Let's just dig.

9913
05:46:59,500 --> 05:47:00,940
Stand far away.

9914
05:47:02,920 --> 05:47:03,560
As you do.

9915
05:47:09,540 --> 05:47:11,100
We're never making it back?

9916
05:47:11,100 --> 05:47:13,340
Oh yeah, that's probably a problem, right?

9917
05:47:13,600 --> 05:47:14,720
No, we'll get back.

9918
05:47:15,060 --> 05:47:15,700
We have the coordinates.

9919
05:47:15,800 --> 05:47:16,060
Yeah.

9920
05:47:18,520 --> 05:47:19,400
We're fine.

9921
05:47:20,580 --> 05:47:21,740
We've got the coordinates.

9922
05:47:24,000 --> 05:47:24,320
Alright.

9923
05:47:25,620 --> 05:47:26,620
You want me to do it?

9924
05:47:27,080 --> 05:47:27,820
You want me to do it?

9925
05:47:28,280 --> 05:47:29,180
Yeah, you can do it.

9926
05:47:30,100 --> 05:47:30,340
Switch.

9927
05:47:30,340 --> 05:47:30,480
Switch.

9928
05:47:35,560 --> 05:47:35,920
Wait,

9929
05:47:39,200 --> 05:47:39,460
hold on.

9930
05:47:39,520 --> 05:47:42,440
Let me set up my setup for optimal.

9931
05:47:42,880 --> 05:47:43,280
There we go.

9932
05:47:43,360 --> 05:47:44,400
You just built another one?

9933
05:47:44,480 --> 05:47:45,560
We don't have obsidian.

9934
05:47:46,080 --> 05:47:46,940
We don't have obsidian.

9935
05:47:47,200 --> 05:47:48,980
Oh my god, this gas is a pain.

9936
05:47:49,060 --> 05:47:50,300
There's so many.

9937
05:47:50,640 --> 05:47:52,140
I know, we're getting really...

9938
05:47:52,140 --> 05:47:52,960
Oh shit, watch out!

9939
05:47:52,960 --> 05:47:53,300
Watch out!

9940
05:47:57,960 --> 05:47:59,820
Nevermind, I didn't even need to warn you.

9941
05:47:59,960 --> 05:48:00,220
Okay.

9942
05:48:03,680 --> 05:48:05,660
What do we do?

9943
05:48:06,240 --> 05:48:06,760
What do you mean?

9944
05:48:07,620 --> 05:48:08,500
Oh, okay.

9945
05:48:11,040 --> 05:48:12,560
I continue onward.

9946
05:48:13,380 --> 05:48:14,240
So brave.

9947
05:48:14,380 --> 05:48:15,460
She's so brave, guys.

9948
05:48:15,600 --> 05:48:18,460
I'm so brave.

9949
05:48:18,560 --> 05:48:19,240
Oh my god.

9950
05:48:19,240 --> 05:48:21,220
She knows what she's doing.

9951
05:48:21,300 --> 05:48:22,440
I'm tabbing out.

9952
05:48:23,420 --> 05:48:25,160
You're tabbing out?

9953
05:48:26,840 --> 05:48:29,620
I realized there hasn't been music for an hour.

9954
05:48:32,360 --> 05:48:36,820
I just realized music stopped for an hour.

9955
05:48:42,180 --> 05:48:44,280
Okay, I'm back.

9956
05:48:45,360 --> 05:48:45,940
Welcome back.

9957
05:48:45,940 --> 05:48:48,100
Where are my torches?

9958
05:48:48,220 --> 05:48:48,740
Oh, there it is.

9959
05:48:51,640 --> 05:48:53,940
You've been using the same song for...

9960
05:48:55,940 --> 05:48:57,680
Yeah, sorry guys.

9961
05:48:58,160 --> 05:48:58,840
You want a different song?

9962
05:49:00,580 --> 05:49:01,780
Sorry, too late.

9963
05:49:02,140 --> 05:49:04,360
They've already...

9964
05:49:04,360 --> 05:49:07,800
They've already Stockholm Syndrome themselves with this song.

9965
05:49:08,320 --> 05:49:08,700
Probably.

9966
05:49:10,220 --> 05:49:12,020
Oh, this is very dangerous.

9967
05:49:13,360 --> 05:49:14,500
Oh, skele-man.

9968
05:49:14,960 --> 05:49:15,660
And ghast.

9969
05:49:16,940 --> 05:49:17,420
Where?

9970
05:49:17,660 --> 05:49:18,960
Oh, that's a bastion.

9971
05:49:19,840 --> 05:49:20,880
That's not a skele-man.

9972
05:49:22,080 --> 05:49:23,300
Wait, that means we're close.

9973
05:49:23,400 --> 05:49:24,660
That's the fortress enemy.

9974
05:49:26,000 --> 05:49:27,940
Does it mean we're close to one?

9975
05:49:28,280 --> 05:49:29,500
Isn't that a fortress enemy?

9976
05:49:32,520 --> 05:49:34,700
I don't think we're going into the bastion.

9977
05:49:35,100 --> 05:49:36,540
I don't think it would be wise.

9978
05:49:36,960 --> 05:49:39,060
They will actually kick our asses.

9979
05:49:39,740 --> 05:49:40,200
What?

9980
05:49:43,240 --> 05:49:45,220
They will actually kick our asses.

9981
05:49:45,260 --> 05:49:47,220
They don't care that we're wearing gold.

9982
05:49:47,260 --> 05:49:49,560
Wait, aren't they the black skellies?

9983
05:49:50,280 --> 05:49:51,240
No, no, no.

9984
05:49:51,580 --> 05:49:52,660
Wait, what's a bastion?

9985
05:49:52,840 --> 05:49:54,580
That's like the stronger piggies.

9986
05:49:57,640 --> 05:49:58,780
Oh my god.

9987
05:49:58,800 --> 05:50:01,220
Oh, I thought you were talking about the black skellies.

9988
05:50:01,520 --> 05:50:02,580
No, please, not me.

9989
05:50:02,880 --> 05:50:03,700
Please, not me.

9990
05:50:03,880 --> 05:50:04,460
Oh, fuck.

9991
05:50:05,020 --> 05:50:06,320
Doki, I'm in trouble.

9992
05:50:06,320 --> 05:50:08,940
Oh, wait, that's not my thing.

9993
05:50:08,980 --> 05:50:09,500
Oh my god.

9994
05:50:09,700 --> 05:50:12,760
I'm trying to figure out the drop-off.

9995
05:50:12,860 --> 05:50:13,460
Why is that my...

9996
05:50:13,460 --> 05:50:16,100
I gave all my arrows to you.

9997
05:50:16,180 --> 05:50:17,380
I was like, why isn't it shooting?

9998
05:50:21,220 --> 05:50:22,080
I'll give you some arrows.

9999
05:50:22,080 --> 05:50:23,100
Okay, let's split them.

10000
05:50:23,480 --> 05:50:25,880
Oh my gosh.

10001
05:50:26,040 --> 05:50:28,840
I didn't even realize you didn't have any arrows left.

10002
05:50:29,320 --> 05:50:32,160
I thought you were talking about the black skellies.

10003
05:50:32,600 --> 05:50:34,300
No, I thought...

10004
05:50:34,300 --> 05:50:36,580
No, I wish that that was them.

10005
05:50:38,420 --> 05:50:39,360
Where'd you go?

10006
05:50:39,800 --> 05:50:42,900
Right here, but I need to grab my sword.

10007
05:50:43,420 --> 05:50:44,020
Behind you?

10008
05:50:44,100 --> 05:50:44,600
Oh, shit.

10009
05:50:48,700 --> 05:50:49,780
That's right, shoot that arrow.

10010
05:50:50,260 --> 05:50:52,240
That's fucking right, you stupid idiot.

10011
05:50:52,380 --> 05:50:52,900
Where are you at?

10012
05:50:53,480 --> 05:50:54,040
Right here.

10013
05:50:54,920 --> 05:50:56,160
Oh my god, again?

10014
05:50:57,580 --> 05:50:58,200
Look up!

10015
05:50:58,200 --> 05:50:58,860
Hold on!

10016
05:50:59,960 --> 05:51:01,360
Oh my god.

10017
05:51:02,120 --> 05:51:03,180
I got you.

10018
05:51:05,760 --> 05:51:06,800
I got you.

10019
05:51:07,460 --> 05:51:08,300
Did you hit any?

10020
05:51:08,820 --> 05:51:09,900
Is that the arrows you shot?

10021
05:51:10,060 --> 05:51:11,920
Are those the gold arrows you shot right there?

10022
05:51:12,160 --> 05:51:14,560
Yeah, I'm gonna take them.

10023
05:51:16,120 --> 05:51:17,120
Oh, there you are.

10024
05:51:18,220 --> 05:51:19,320
You were closer.

10025
05:51:20,740 --> 05:51:21,860
Oh, it left a tear!

10026
05:51:22,720 --> 05:51:23,640
Oh, that's good.

10027
05:51:23,820 --> 05:51:24,940
What are the tears for again?

10028
05:51:25,160 --> 05:51:25,820
Potions, right?

10029
05:51:26,700 --> 05:51:28,200
Maybe, I don't remember actually.

10030
05:51:28,480 --> 05:51:30,720
Some sort of potion thing, yeah.

10031
05:51:38,330 --> 05:51:39,730
That was a scary sound.

10032
05:51:41,730 --> 05:51:43,030
Where did we go?

10033
05:51:43,370 --> 05:51:44,490
Oh, regen potion.

10034
05:51:46,770 --> 05:51:47,470
That's good.

10035
05:51:47,630 --> 05:51:48,670
That's a good thing to have.

10036
05:51:48,830 --> 05:51:49,670
Yeah, that's a good thing.

10037
05:51:49,810 --> 05:51:50,770
Do we need soul soil?

10038
05:51:51,110 --> 05:51:51,850
Do we need that?

10039
05:51:51,970 --> 05:51:53,470
No, I don't think so.

10040
05:51:54,450 --> 05:51:56,390
So many things I don't know we need.

10041
05:51:56,950 --> 05:51:58,350
Where do we go, guys?

10042
05:51:58,410 --> 05:51:59,010
Where do we go?

10043
05:51:59,010 --> 05:52:01,350
Oh no, we're unlucky!

10044
05:52:03,170 --> 05:52:05,010
We're in the fortress!

10045
05:52:05,610 --> 05:52:06,350
We're in the fortress!

10046
05:52:06,590 --> 05:52:09,250
I don't even know where we are!

10047
05:52:10,450 --> 05:52:11,410
I'm gonna kill the skeleton.

10048
05:52:11,670 --> 05:52:12,670
This guy looked at me funny.

10049
05:52:12,670 --> 05:52:13,210
Yeah, kill his ass.

10050
05:52:16,770 --> 05:52:18,110
It's okay, you can go get it again.

10051
05:52:19,330 --> 05:52:19,670
Yeah.

10052
05:52:21,850 --> 05:52:23,430
Just block on over.

10053
05:52:23,430 --> 05:52:23,490
Just block on over.

10054
05:52:28,550 --> 05:52:29,590
There it goes!

10055
05:52:31,330 --> 05:52:32,590
Why did it fall?

10056
05:52:34,710 --> 05:52:35,430
Oh my god.

10057
05:52:41,570 --> 05:52:42,910
I think they...

10058
05:52:42,910 --> 05:52:43,590
Oh my god.

10059
05:52:44,350 --> 05:52:48,630
Wait, what is...

10060
05:52:48,630 --> 05:52:49,570
What is that coming up?

10061
05:52:49,570 --> 05:52:51,830
You shot the pig!

10062
05:52:52,850 --> 05:52:53,910
Oh god, Doki!

10063
05:52:54,030 --> 05:52:55,170
They're all coming for you!

10064
05:52:57,770 --> 05:52:59,510
Oh my god, there's another ghast.

10065
05:52:59,590 --> 05:53:00,310
There's another ghast.

10066
05:53:00,370 --> 05:53:01,150
Watch out!

10067
05:53:01,390 --> 05:53:02,930
No, this can't be it.

10068
05:53:03,370 --> 05:53:04,330
There's two of them!

10069
05:53:05,910 --> 05:53:06,630
Oh my god.

10070
05:53:06,990 --> 05:53:08,930
This is so bad.

10071
05:53:09,510 --> 05:53:09,990
Just run.

10072
05:53:10,090 --> 05:53:11,350
I'll try and take care of the ghasts.

10073
05:53:12,070 --> 05:53:12,710
I got one.

10074
05:53:15,750 --> 05:53:16,150
Okay.

10075
05:53:16,150 --> 05:53:17,830
Where are you?

10076
05:53:19,230 --> 05:53:21,630
I'm trying to kill the other ghasts.

10077
05:53:21,670 --> 05:53:22,310
Oh, you got him?

10078
05:53:22,610 --> 05:53:23,010
You're running?

10079
05:53:23,310 --> 05:53:24,810
Oh my god!

10080
05:53:32,190 --> 05:53:33,030
I'm okay.

10081
05:53:33,510 --> 05:53:34,230
Are you really?

10082
05:53:34,850 --> 05:53:35,670
No, I'm not.

10083
05:53:36,210 --> 05:53:37,490
I'm not okay.

10084
05:53:37,730 --> 05:53:40,070
I think all we have to do is kill these guys...

10085
05:53:40,070 --> 05:53:41,770
away from other pigs...

10086
05:53:41,770 --> 05:53:42,490
and we'll be fine.

10087
05:53:44,970 --> 05:53:46,070
I don't know.

10088
05:53:46,490 --> 05:53:48,110
I don't know.

10089
05:53:56,070 --> 05:53:57,270
Oh my god.

10090
05:53:57,930 --> 05:53:59,850
I don't know how I got him.

10091
05:54:00,150 --> 05:54:00,530
No!

10092
05:54:01,190 --> 05:54:02,770
There's another ghast.

10093
05:54:03,190 --> 05:54:04,950
There's a ghast in front of me!

10094
05:54:10,110 --> 05:54:12,670
I don't know if I can take them all.

10095
05:54:12,730 --> 05:54:13,350
Can I get them?

10096
05:54:14,630 --> 05:54:15,850
I'm gonna start shooting them.

10097
05:54:21,270 --> 05:54:22,850
I'm gonna use up all my spectral arrow.

10098
05:54:22,950 --> 05:54:23,990
I'm just letting you know that.

10099
05:54:24,250 --> 05:54:24,670
Wait!

10100
05:54:24,870 --> 05:54:26,170
Don't do that!

10101
05:54:26,650 --> 05:54:28,150
I have 15 left.

10102
05:54:29,570 --> 05:54:31,210
Here I'll start attacking too.

10103
05:54:40,930 --> 05:54:42,470
Use your shield!

10104
05:54:43,450 --> 05:54:44,270
I am!

10105
05:54:44,850 --> 05:54:45,650
I'm coming!

10106
05:54:47,130 --> 05:54:47,950
I'm coming!

10107
05:54:51,370 --> 05:54:53,110
Oh my god, there's the ghast still.

10108
05:54:53,250 --> 05:54:53,970
There's the ghast.

10109
05:54:54,250 --> 05:54:55,570
There's the ghast still.

10110
05:54:56,710 --> 05:54:57,930
Oh my god.

10111
05:55:00,090 --> 05:55:01,470
We did it!

10112
05:55:03,110 --> 05:55:04,050
Oh my gosh.

10113
05:55:04,290 --> 05:55:05,310
Eat, eat, eat.

10114
05:55:06,210 --> 05:55:07,450
Oh, there's two ghasts.

10115
05:55:07,650 --> 05:55:08,350
There's two ghasts.

10116
05:55:09,090 --> 05:55:09,970
Oh my god, please.

10117
05:55:10,110 --> 05:55:11,210
Why are there so many ghasts?

10118
05:55:11,270 --> 05:55:12,030
What did they do?

10119
05:55:12,270 --> 05:55:14,450
Why did they up the nether so much?

10120
05:55:14,790 --> 05:55:16,330
This is so messed up!

10121
05:55:17,650 --> 05:55:18,950
Oh my god, watch out Doki.

10122
05:55:18,950 --> 05:55:20,350
He's like literally right behind you.

10123
05:55:20,650 --> 05:55:22,450
Oh my god, there's another one?

10124
05:55:23,130 --> 05:55:24,450
He's still spawning!

10125
05:55:25,490 --> 05:55:26,850
We need more arrows.

10126
05:55:26,970 --> 05:55:28,090
We don't have enough arrows.

10127
05:55:35,250 --> 05:55:37,690
Try to figure out the drop off for this guy.

10128
05:55:37,890 --> 05:55:38,830
Oh my god, I can't either.

10129
05:55:39,350 --> 05:55:39,930
I can't.

10130
05:55:40,230 --> 05:55:41,170
Oh, I got him once.

10131
05:55:43,730 --> 05:55:46,430
Oh my god, is he closer than I expected?

10132
05:55:46,430 --> 05:55:46,510
Ah!

10133
05:55:53,370 --> 05:55:54,650
Oh my god.

10134
05:55:54,690 --> 05:55:56,370
Let's just get out of here.

10135
05:55:56,550 --> 05:55:57,070
Let's just leave.

10136
05:56:02,930 --> 05:56:04,170
This area sucks.

10137
05:56:04,310 --> 05:56:05,470
It sucks, it sucks, it sucks.

10138
05:56:05,630 --> 05:56:06,710
Oh my god, get his ass.

10139
05:56:11,450 --> 05:56:11,830
What?

10140
05:56:12,450 --> 05:56:12,830
Why?

10141
05:56:12,990 --> 05:56:13,950
I thought it was...

10142
05:56:16,430 --> 05:56:17,770
They were like, get out of there.

10143
05:56:18,030 --> 05:56:19,490
Gastly loves this place.

10144
05:56:19,490 --> 05:56:21,390
But I thought they loved the red area.

10145
05:56:21,610 --> 05:56:24,610
Okay, we can't go that way because that's to the bastion and they will like...

10146
05:56:25,130 --> 05:56:25,770
Mog us.

10147
05:56:25,990 --> 05:56:27,050
It'll be so bad.

10148
05:56:27,510 --> 05:56:29,590
Oh my god, no please.

10149
05:56:29,850 --> 05:56:31,470
Oh my god, another one!

10150
05:56:32,150 --> 05:56:33,270
We need to get out.

10151
05:56:34,130 --> 05:56:36,230
We need to get out of the soul sand!

10152
05:56:36,870 --> 05:56:38,270
How do we get out of the soul sand?

10153
05:56:38,770 --> 05:56:41,650
I don't know how to get out of here in the first place!

10154
05:56:46,430 --> 05:56:47,430
There he is, the pigs!

10155
05:56:48,910 --> 05:56:49,590
I killed him.

10156
05:56:50,170 --> 05:56:50,790
I killed him.

10157
05:56:50,990 --> 05:56:51,550
Okay, okay, okay.

10158
05:56:54,010 --> 05:56:54,410
Alright.

10159
05:56:56,070 --> 05:56:57,130
We just gotta get out.

10160
05:56:57,750 --> 05:56:58,510
Just gotta get out.

10161
05:56:58,790 --> 05:57:00,190
Oh my god, another one spawned in.

10162
05:57:00,730 --> 05:57:02,010
Do you have the coordinates?

10163
05:57:02,830 --> 05:57:03,770
How do we get here?

10164
05:57:05,510 --> 05:57:06,330
Okay, hold on.

10165
05:57:07,290 --> 05:57:08,230
How do we get here?

10166
05:57:09,750 --> 05:57:11,070
Just run this way!

10167
05:57:12,250 --> 05:57:14,330
I don't know, I think a bridge would be...

10168
05:57:14,330 --> 05:57:16,170
Maybe the easiest way, I don't know.

10169
05:57:16,190 --> 05:57:17,530
A bridge in this area!

10170
05:57:17,570 --> 05:57:19,970
I don't know!

10171
05:57:20,090 --> 05:57:20,970
Wait, we are in the red area!

10172
05:57:21,530 --> 05:57:21,970
Okay.

10173
05:57:27,110 --> 05:57:28,990
Let's just explore the red area.

10174
05:57:29,350 --> 05:57:30,930
Yeah, let's explore the red area.

10175
05:57:32,410 --> 05:57:33,650
Let's never go back.

10176
05:57:33,790 --> 05:57:34,130
Never go back.

10177
05:57:34,970 --> 05:57:35,690
Never go back.

10178
05:57:35,910 --> 05:57:37,250
Never go back.

10179
05:57:37,530 --> 05:57:38,650
I don't wanna go there.

10180
05:57:39,010 --> 05:57:40,370
The red area is better.

10181
05:57:40,370 --> 05:57:41,430
The red area is better.

10182
05:57:41,850 --> 05:57:43,010
Oh my god!

10183
05:57:43,710 --> 05:57:45,470
Oh my god!

10184
05:57:45,850 --> 05:57:47,470
Just leave, just leave!

10185
05:57:48,130 --> 05:57:48,990
Oh my gosh.

10186
05:57:50,690 --> 05:57:51,450
Wait, I can trade.

10187
05:57:54,450 --> 05:57:55,070
Trade...

10188
05:57:57,390 --> 05:57:58,010
Trade...

10189
05:58:02,120 --> 05:58:04,510
Oh thank god, spectral arrows.

10190
05:58:04,770 --> 05:58:05,650
Oh thank god.

10191
05:58:06,410 --> 05:58:07,770
Maybe he'll give you more.

10192
05:58:08,490 --> 05:58:10,430
I have leather right here, you have leather, right?

10193
05:58:10,630 --> 05:58:12,070
Oh yeah, yeah, I'll take it.

10194
05:58:12,270 --> 05:58:13,530
Did he give you anything else?

10195
05:58:14,390 --> 05:58:15,770
No, they gave me spectral arrows.

10196
05:58:15,790 --> 05:58:17,370
Wait, there's more right here.

10197
05:58:17,730 --> 05:58:18,610
That they didn't pick up.

10198
05:58:18,890 --> 05:58:21,830
I like to only give them one at a time, because they just...

10199
05:58:21,830 --> 05:58:23,130
They end up missing a bunch.

10200
05:58:25,670 --> 05:58:27,570
Oh my god, I would make him a whole...

10201
05:58:27,570 --> 05:58:28,570
Stop running away, you bitch!

10202
05:58:28,950 --> 05:58:31,130
I know, like, he takes it and then runs off.

10203
05:58:31,150 --> 05:58:31,590
I know!

10204
05:58:33,850 --> 05:58:35,010
Like, he's stupid.

10205
05:58:35,010 --> 05:58:36,830
Oh, they gave me more arrows!

10206
05:58:37,870 --> 05:58:39,310
Nice, we both need that.

10207
05:58:40,790 --> 05:58:43,730
This ghast, I'm going to become the joker.

10208
05:58:43,970 --> 05:58:44,690
Leave us alone!

10209
05:58:45,330 --> 05:58:46,170
Leave us alone!

10210
05:58:46,210 --> 05:58:48,510
It only takes one bad day.

10211
05:58:55,230 --> 05:58:56,350
Fire resistance!

10212
05:58:56,730 --> 05:58:57,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10213
05:58:57,670 --> 05:58:59,670
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

10214
05:58:59,850 --> 05:59:00,930
How much is that?

10215
05:59:00,990 --> 05:59:01,850
How many minutes?

10216
05:59:01,850 --> 05:59:02,750
Three minutes, three minutes.

10217
05:59:02,850 --> 05:59:05,410
You got it, right?

10218
05:59:06,070 --> 05:59:07,050
He gave another one!

10219
05:59:07,070 --> 05:59:08,110
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

10220
05:59:09,190 --> 05:59:10,670
This is a lucky gacha.

10221
05:59:11,710 --> 05:59:13,690
I can only carry one fire resistance.

10222
05:59:13,870 --> 05:59:14,770
I can't stack up.

10223
05:59:14,930 --> 05:59:16,230
No, no, they don't stack up.

10224
05:59:16,270 --> 05:59:17,870
Unless that was the one he...

10225
05:59:17,870 --> 05:59:19,450
The one that you...

10226
05:59:19,450 --> 05:59:21,590
No, no, no, I got the second one already.

10227
05:59:22,410 --> 05:59:23,590
He gave bricks.

10228
05:59:24,790 --> 05:59:25,510
Where did he go?

10229
05:59:26,850 --> 05:59:27,510
He's here.

10230
05:59:27,630 --> 05:59:28,470
I think he's all out.

10231
05:59:28,470 --> 05:59:30,150
Oh, nevermind.

10232
05:59:30,770 --> 05:59:31,470
No, I have more.

10233
05:59:32,430 --> 05:59:32,850
Okay.

10234
05:59:35,480 --> 05:59:37,360
What's that sound?

10235
05:59:38,180 --> 05:59:38,740
That's the...

10236
05:59:38,740 --> 05:59:40,180
The ghast?

10237
05:59:40,960 --> 05:59:43,420
No, you hear the sparkle sound?

10238
05:59:43,780 --> 05:59:44,380
Oh my god!

10239
05:59:44,480 --> 05:59:48,100
Are you fucking serious?

10240
05:59:49,140 --> 05:59:49,860
I hate them.

10241
05:59:49,960 --> 05:59:51,400
I hate these guys so...

10242
05:59:51,880 --> 05:59:54,740
With every fiber of my being.

10243
05:59:54,880 --> 05:59:55,440
I hate them so much.

10244
05:59:56,900 --> 05:59:57,400
Oh my god.

10245
05:59:57,400 --> 05:59:58,040
This letter.

10246
05:59:58,540 --> 05:59:59,320
Let's just leave.

10247
05:59:59,420 --> 06:00:00,300
Let's just leave.

10248
06:00:01,340 --> 06:00:03,680
I don't wanna deal with them.

10249
06:00:03,980 --> 06:00:04,820
They can have...

10250
06:00:05,200 --> 06:00:06,380
They can have this area.

10251
06:00:07,760 --> 06:00:09,080
They live here.

10252
06:00:09,160 --> 06:00:10,200
I don't care anymore.

10253
06:00:13,040 --> 06:00:14,920
I don't wanna deal with them anymore.

10254
06:00:14,940 --> 06:00:15,840
It's a tactical retreat.

10255
06:00:17,180 --> 06:00:18,360
It's so tactical.

10256
06:00:20,840 --> 06:00:23,500
I don't see a fortress anymore.

10257
06:00:23,500 --> 06:00:24,880
Oh, this is a different biome though.

10258
06:00:25,000 --> 06:00:25,360
Nice.

10259
06:00:25,360 --> 06:00:26,240
This is...

10260
06:00:26,240 --> 06:00:28,240
This one's not as bad.

10261
06:00:28,420 --> 06:00:30,040
There's just a lot of lava...

10262
06:00:30,040 --> 06:00:31,320
And sometimes magma cubes.

10263
06:00:33,100 --> 06:00:33,540
Yeah.

10264
06:00:35,080 --> 06:00:36,740
That's not that bad.

10265
06:00:36,780 --> 06:00:37,500
I hear him.

10266
06:00:39,100 --> 06:00:40,720
You always hear them.

10267
06:00:40,780 --> 06:00:42,840
You close your eyes, and he's there.

10268
06:00:46,120 --> 06:00:49,860
You close your eyes, and he'll always be there.

10269
06:00:50,540 --> 06:00:52,280
You guys hate the bustled ones?

10270
06:00:52,380 --> 06:00:52,700
Why?

10271
06:00:52,700 --> 06:00:54,220
Is it because they're annoying to get through?

10272
06:00:56,260 --> 06:00:57,540
But we need to go.

10273
06:00:57,700 --> 06:00:59,000
We need to venture forward.

10274
06:00:59,200 --> 06:00:59,940
Where do we go?

10275
06:01:00,260 --> 06:01:01,640
We need to find the fortress!

10276
06:01:02,000 --> 06:01:04,160
We need to find the fortress!

10277
06:01:04,720 --> 06:01:05,920
But where...

10278
06:01:05,920 --> 06:01:06,980
Which way?

10279
06:01:08,060 --> 06:01:09,100
Which way?

10280
06:01:10,320 --> 06:01:11,060
Don't dig up!

10281
06:01:11,120 --> 06:01:12,100
What is wrong with you?!

10282
06:01:12,100 --> 06:01:12,860
Don't dig up!

10283
06:01:13,380 --> 06:01:14,720
But there's gold!

10284
06:01:17,800 --> 06:01:19,040
Yeah, it's there.

10285
06:01:19,040 --> 06:01:19,080
It's there.

10286
06:01:20,780 --> 06:01:23,460
Someone's like, basalt equals parkour nether.

10287
06:01:24,040 --> 06:01:25,680
That's true, yes.

10288
06:01:29,180 --> 06:01:32,060
I don't think so.

10289
06:01:32,680 --> 06:01:33,780
I mean, we got the boat.

10290
06:01:33,980 --> 06:01:35,460
I think we gotta go through the basalt.

10291
06:01:39,000 --> 06:01:40,040
Or something.

10292
06:01:40,240 --> 06:01:42,140
Or we gotta... Maybe we go down.

10293
06:01:44,780 --> 06:01:46,680
I'm drinking my lava resistance.

10294
06:01:46,680 --> 06:01:47,000
No!

10295
06:01:53,460 --> 06:01:54,500
Don't do it!

10296
06:01:54,760 --> 06:01:55,800
Not yet!

10297
06:01:57,020 --> 06:01:59,160
Okay, why don't we get boat and row down?

10298
06:01:59,340 --> 06:01:59,980
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10299
06:02:00,020 --> 06:02:00,760
Boat and row down.

10300
06:02:00,840 --> 06:02:01,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10301
06:02:01,940 --> 06:02:02,200
Okay.

10302
06:02:06,540 --> 06:02:08,480
Alright, my life is in your hands.

10303
06:02:08,520 --> 06:02:09,340
Wait, are we good?

10304
06:02:09,900 --> 06:02:10,900
Is there anything down there?

10305
06:02:11,220 --> 06:02:12,040
I don't know.

10306
06:02:12,300 --> 06:02:14,080
Oh shit, that's really close.

10307
06:02:14,080 --> 06:02:14,880
Wait!

10308
06:02:17,280 --> 06:02:19,420
I don't know if...

10309
06:02:19,420 --> 06:02:21,040
I'm drinking my fire resistance.

10310
06:02:21,380 --> 06:02:21,640
No!

10311
06:02:21,780 --> 06:02:22,420
Don't do it!

10312
06:02:22,820 --> 06:02:25,080
I don't think we should do it.

10313
06:02:25,660 --> 06:02:26,360
Do it?

10314
06:02:26,420 --> 06:02:27,000
No balls?

10315
06:02:27,340 --> 06:02:28,580
Okay, someone told me...

10316
06:02:28,580 --> 06:02:30,440
I'm drinking it all.

10317
06:02:35,240 --> 06:02:36,840
Doki, we would've made it.

10318
06:02:37,240 --> 06:02:38,120
Doki, look at this!

10319
06:02:38,640 --> 06:02:39,700
You fucking idiot!

10320
06:02:39,700 --> 06:02:41,980
I didn't drink it!

10321
06:02:42,300 --> 06:02:43,580
You fucking idiot!

10322
06:02:48,280 --> 06:02:49,480
Okay, then we're fine.

10323
06:02:50,000 --> 06:02:50,740
I take it back.

10324
06:02:51,600 --> 06:02:53,020
I retract my statement.

10325
06:02:53,960 --> 06:02:55,340
Does the baby give you gold?

10326
06:02:56,540 --> 06:02:57,080
Oh, does he?

10327
06:02:57,480 --> 06:02:58,740
Oh, he does!

10328
06:02:59,100 --> 06:03:00,720
What do you give us, baby?

10329
06:03:00,980 --> 06:03:03,800
What if he's like stupid and gives us really great stuff?

10330
06:03:04,160 --> 06:03:05,680
Oh, he just took it!

10331
06:03:10,900 --> 06:03:11,720
Kill him!

10332
06:03:12,360 --> 06:03:13,760
No, don't kill him!

10333
06:03:14,040 --> 06:03:15,380
There's no other guys around.

10334
06:03:15,440 --> 06:03:16,220
We can kill him.

10335
06:03:16,720 --> 06:03:17,760
You do it.

10336
06:03:18,700 --> 06:03:19,660
Kill the child.

10337
06:03:19,860 --> 06:03:21,300
There's a guy right next to you.

10338
06:03:21,760 --> 06:03:22,580
He's a zombie.

10339
06:03:28,260 --> 06:03:29,380
I got it back.

10340
06:03:29,580 --> 06:03:30,380
There you go.

10341
06:03:30,560 --> 06:03:32,200
You killed a child.

10342
06:03:32,320 --> 06:03:32,900
I don't care.

10343
06:03:33,000 --> 06:03:34,520
It's about survival in this mode.

10344
06:03:34,520 --> 06:03:36,660
Why did you kill him?

10345
06:03:37,540 --> 06:03:38,740
We got scammed!

10346
06:03:41,280 --> 06:03:43,660
I took it and just looked at me.

10347
06:03:45,480 --> 06:03:46,900
He was like, yeah.

10348
06:03:47,980 --> 06:03:48,920
Thanks for that.

10349
06:03:48,980 --> 06:03:49,960
Neat present.

10350
06:03:50,360 --> 06:03:56,020
I thought he was gonna be like, I don't know what's worth good stuff since I'm a baby.

10351
06:03:57,140 --> 06:03:58,960
I thought that's what he was gonna do.

10352
06:03:58,960 --> 06:04:04,260
I was like, wow, these nice ladies gave me some money.

10353
06:04:06,160 --> 06:04:07,120
So sweet.

10354
06:04:07,380 --> 06:04:09,240
And then you just killed him.

10355
06:04:09,360 --> 06:04:11,240
Yeah, and I'll do it again if he steals our stuff.

10356
06:04:11,380 --> 06:04:11,900
Watch out.

10357
06:04:13,140 --> 06:04:14,360
Watch out, children!

10358
06:04:14,740 --> 06:04:16,080
She's gonna do it.

10359
06:04:17,000 --> 06:04:18,340
She's gonna do it.

10360
06:04:18,480 --> 06:04:19,440
She ain't afraid.

10361
06:04:19,540 --> 06:04:20,140
There's a hole here.

10362
06:04:20,620 --> 06:04:22,120
Okay, I thought there was a...

10363
06:04:22,120 --> 06:04:24,980
I keep getting tricked and thinking I see a fortress.

10364
06:04:26,520 --> 06:04:28,500
We'll never find the fortress.

10365
06:04:29,600 --> 06:04:32,880
We'll never find the fortress.

10366
06:04:33,280 --> 06:04:35,640
We have to or else we don't beat the game.

10367
06:04:36,680 --> 06:04:38,300
This is our personal hell.

10368
06:04:38,380 --> 06:04:39,220
This is our nether.

10369
06:04:40,960 --> 06:04:42,560
We have to or else...

10370
06:04:42,560 --> 06:04:43,480
This is our silent hill.

10371
06:04:43,760 --> 06:04:43,980
No!

10372
06:04:44,760 --> 06:04:46,100
This is our silent hill.

10373
06:04:46,280 --> 06:04:47,500
I'm just looking for my wife.

10374
06:04:48,440 --> 06:04:51,220
I'm just looking for the fortress.

10375
06:04:52,940 --> 06:04:54,920
The fortress for my wife.

10376
06:04:57,660 --> 06:04:58,580
What's that?

10377
06:04:59,100 --> 06:05:00,780
What is that in front of me?

10378
06:05:02,000 --> 06:05:02,360
No.

10379
06:05:03,120 --> 06:05:06,320
How many fortresses are in the nether?

10380
06:05:07,500 --> 06:05:08,600
I don't know.

10381
06:05:10,420 --> 06:05:12,280
Alright, I'm going up.

10382
06:05:14,480 --> 06:05:17,500
Maybe we should go to the right to avoid the...

10383
06:05:18,620 --> 06:05:19,660
Avoid what?

10384
06:05:19,660 --> 06:05:20,940
The basalt area.

10385
06:05:22,200 --> 06:05:24,060
There's only basalt here.

10386
06:05:24,220 --> 06:05:25,740
No, I mean to the other direction.

10387
06:05:26,080 --> 06:05:26,500
Like this way.

10388
06:05:26,560 --> 06:05:26,940
This way?

10389
06:05:27,480 --> 06:05:28,980
Yeah, that way.

10390
06:05:29,200 --> 06:05:30,160
Alright, let's do it.

10391
06:05:30,340 --> 06:05:31,240
I'm building up.

10392
06:05:31,540 --> 06:05:35,600
I think bad happens when you build up.

10393
06:05:36,220 --> 06:05:37,960
I don't know if that's true or not.

10394
06:05:39,740 --> 06:05:43,120
I like how everyone in my chat was like, I suggest you avoid Basalt.

10395
06:05:45,160 --> 06:05:46,760
Oh, he has all gold.

10396
06:05:46,760 --> 06:05:48,560
Surely he's rich.

10397
06:05:48,760 --> 06:05:50,220
Oh my gosh, royalty!

10398
06:05:51,040 --> 06:05:52,380
He's so fucking rich.

10399
06:05:54,380 --> 06:05:59,420
He gave me blackstone.

10400
06:06:01,880 --> 06:06:04,720
He gave me gravel.

10401
06:06:06,900 --> 06:06:07,560
There's more.

10402
06:06:07,980 --> 06:06:08,940
Oh, he gave me arrows.

10403
06:06:09,600 --> 06:06:09,940
Oh, okay.

10404
06:06:10,520 --> 06:06:10,940
Wait, me?

10405
06:06:11,020 --> 06:06:11,380
I took them?

10406
06:06:11,580 --> 06:06:13,580
Yeah, it's fine.

10407
06:06:13,580 --> 06:06:17,200
Uh, iron chunks.

10408
06:06:17,440 --> 06:06:18,340
Yeah, that's fine.

10409
06:06:18,440 --> 06:06:19,180
I'll take it.

10410
06:06:21,780 --> 06:06:23,100
Oh, I got an obsidian.

10411
06:06:23,320 --> 06:06:24,940
I took the obsidian just in case.

10412
06:06:24,960 --> 06:06:25,980
Oh, yeah, we need obsidian.

10413
06:06:27,940 --> 06:06:29,460
And there's more obsidian here.

10414
06:06:29,680 --> 06:06:30,000
Oh, okay.

10415
06:06:30,180 --> 06:06:30,460
I'll take it.

10416
06:06:30,520 --> 06:06:30,800
I'll take it.

10417
06:06:32,100 --> 06:06:33,280
Almost went through that.

10418
06:06:33,660 --> 06:06:34,240
It's not deep.

10419
06:06:34,280 --> 06:06:34,600
It's okay.

10420
06:06:35,900 --> 06:06:36,940
Okay, where do we go?

10421
06:06:37,140 --> 06:06:38,940
Okay, uh...

10422
06:06:38,940 --> 06:06:40,220
Take the lead.

10423
06:06:40,860 --> 06:06:41,860
Take the lead.

10424
06:06:41,860 --> 06:06:43,180
Oh, hold on.

10425
06:06:43,320 --> 06:06:44,640
Can we go down here?

10426
06:06:44,760 --> 06:06:47,200
I think we might be able to boat this one.

10427
06:06:47,300 --> 06:06:48,100
Oh, maybe not.

10428
06:06:51,200 --> 06:06:52,080
Here's the boat.

10429
06:06:52,280 --> 06:06:53,200
No, no, not yet.

10430
06:06:53,380 --> 06:06:54,040
Here's the boat.

10431
06:06:54,100 --> 06:06:54,780
No, no.

10432
06:06:54,800 --> 06:06:55,580
Here it is.

10433
06:06:55,600 --> 06:06:57,420
No, I think... I don't think we can.

10434
06:06:57,820 --> 06:06:58,780
I don't think we can.

10435
06:06:59,120 --> 06:07:02,060
Let's dig through here and then we can probably dig out on the other side.

10436
06:07:03,640 --> 06:07:05,320
I think I need some gamer subs.

10437
06:07:05,840 --> 06:07:10,140
Guys, can you use my gamer sub code, DokiBird, to get...

10438
06:07:10,140 --> 06:07:11,000
Stop digging!

10439
06:07:11,340 --> 06:07:12,320
Stop it, please!

10440
06:07:14,260 --> 06:07:17,780
...to get 15% off of your next order.

10441
06:07:17,860 --> 06:07:18,580
Or is it 10%?

10442
06:07:18,720 --> 06:07:19,300
I don't remember.

10443
06:07:19,380 --> 06:07:20,420
You remember it, right?

10444
06:07:21,140 --> 06:07:22,260
I don't remember.

10445
06:07:22,560 --> 06:07:25,160
It's either 10% or 15%, but it works.

10446
06:07:25,340 --> 06:07:28,020
Do you still get sent stuff by them?

10447
06:07:28,420 --> 06:07:28,940
Yeah, yeah.

10448
06:07:28,940 --> 06:07:29,880
Oh my god.

10449
06:07:30,320 --> 06:07:31,340
I get so much stuff.

10450
06:07:31,840 --> 06:07:32,340
So...

10451
06:07:32,880 --> 06:07:33,700
Yeah, yeah.

10452
06:07:33,720 --> 06:07:35,640
Like, every promotion they do.

10453
06:07:35,840 --> 06:07:38,260
I think that's like for all creators, too.

10454
06:07:38,260 --> 06:07:39,280
We get, like, everything.

10455
06:07:39,420 --> 06:07:41,760
Okay, I'm gonna do this from far away and then you grab it.

10456
06:07:42,280 --> 06:07:42,440
Okay.

10457
06:07:44,100 --> 06:07:47,440
The clothes and, like, the gamer subs.

10458
06:07:48,420 --> 06:07:48,900
Everything.

10459
06:07:50,260 --> 06:07:50,700
Yeah.

10460
06:07:52,000 --> 06:07:54,060
Oh no, I haven't withdrawn my money.

10461
06:07:54,260 --> 06:07:55,060
I have to do that.

10462
06:07:57,620 --> 06:08:04,520
Guys, use the creator code, DokiBird, to get 10% off.

10463
06:08:04,520 --> 06:08:05,220
Boomer, Boomer, Boomer.

10464
06:08:05,220 --> 06:08:06,760
But you guys know what we both have?

10465
06:08:06,860 --> 06:08:08,120
That's the same thing.

10466
06:08:08,260 --> 06:08:10,280
Our Phantom Thief concert!

10467
06:08:11,700 --> 06:08:12,080
Yeah!

10468
06:08:14,520 --> 06:08:15,720
We have...

10469
06:08:17,160 --> 06:08:18,340
I almost said it.

10470
06:08:19,340 --> 06:08:22,200
Did you almost say that person?

10471
06:08:25,180 --> 06:08:30,320
We have some special guests that are still unannounced.

10472
06:08:32,700 --> 06:08:33,380
Uh...

10473
06:08:33,380 --> 06:08:36,080
Special guests that are unannounced.

10474
06:08:38,540 --> 06:08:40,820
They are definitely unannounced.

10475
06:08:41,340 --> 06:08:42,300
Very unannounced.

10476
06:08:42,460 --> 06:08:43,500
Very secretive.

10477
06:08:43,640 --> 06:08:45,200
I can't say.

10478
06:08:50,360 --> 06:08:52,320
Oh my god, please.

10479
06:08:52,460 --> 06:08:53,580
I'm like the Tom Holland.

10480
06:08:55,520 --> 06:08:57,000
But it'll be fun.

10481
06:08:57,160 --> 06:08:58,760
We'll be in full 3D.

10482
06:08:59,380 --> 06:09:01,840
Oh my god, how did you know I was gonna say Jerma?

10483
06:09:02,020 --> 06:09:02,860
Oh my god.

10484
06:09:05,760 --> 06:09:06,180
No.

10485
06:09:07,500 --> 06:09:09,040
Isn't this the big picky area?

10486
06:09:09,560 --> 06:09:09,980
Yes.

10487
06:09:10,820 --> 06:09:12,800
This is the big picky area.

10488
06:09:12,940 --> 06:09:13,300
Yes.

10489
06:09:14,200 --> 06:09:15,600
I don't see any of them.

10490
06:09:16,040 --> 06:09:16,740
I do.

10491
06:09:16,880 --> 06:09:19,100
I see one right there and one right there.

10492
06:09:19,120 --> 06:09:20,120
Oh, I see him.

10493
06:09:20,480 --> 06:09:21,640
Wait, maybe that's not one.

10494
06:09:21,740 --> 06:09:22,080
I don't know.

10495
06:09:22,380 --> 06:09:23,040
No, I see him.

10496
06:09:23,080 --> 06:09:23,860
He's on the far right.

10497
06:09:23,920 --> 06:09:24,560
I saw him.

10498
06:09:24,580 --> 06:09:25,400
Oh my god.

10499
06:09:25,400 --> 06:09:26,740
I looked him in the eye.

10500
06:09:26,920 --> 06:09:29,180
Maybe the fortress is across that.

10501
06:09:29,840 --> 06:09:32,520
Oh, we're gonna be really...

10502
06:09:34,540 --> 06:09:38,000
Our shields will be super needy here.

10503
06:09:38,220 --> 06:09:38,740
Necessary.

10504
06:09:38,760 --> 06:09:40,420
Okay, I believe in us.

10505
06:09:40,620 --> 06:09:41,880
Let's go in.

10506
06:09:42,600 --> 06:09:44,080
We gotta make sacrifices.

10507
06:09:44,080 --> 06:09:46,020
And I have warped fungus.

10508
06:09:48,160 --> 06:09:51,980
Okay, I'm just saying that there's a lot of lava over there.

10509
06:09:52,080 --> 06:09:54,040
What if it's above us?

10510
06:09:55,880 --> 06:09:56,900
We're at 91.

10511
06:09:57,040 --> 06:09:58,040
That's kind of high, right?

10512
06:09:58,760 --> 06:09:59,900
Oh, that is high.

10513
06:09:59,980 --> 06:10:00,720
I don't know.

10514
06:10:01,580 --> 06:10:02,880
Oh, we climbed the trees.

10515
06:10:03,280 --> 06:10:03,760
Parkour.

10516
06:10:04,680 --> 06:10:06,360
Wait, we can just go around it, right?

10517
06:10:07,960 --> 06:10:09,120
I'm on the tree.

10518
06:10:09,800 --> 06:10:10,460
Can't jump.

10519
06:10:11,300 --> 06:10:12,960
Oh, why are you going inside?

10520
06:10:13,360 --> 06:10:15,300
Oh, you left a bunch of...

10521
06:10:15,300 --> 06:10:16,720
You left so much gold here.

10522
06:10:17,320 --> 06:10:17,760
Did I?

10523
06:10:17,900 --> 06:10:18,260
Yeah.

10524
06:10:19,040 --> 06:10:20,940
Oh, I have 64.

10525
06:10:21,300 --> 06:10:21,660
That's why.

10526
06:10:21,660 --> 06:10:22,540
Okay, I'm grabbing it.

10527
06:10:22,540 --> 06:10:24,840
I'm gonna make some gold then.

10528
06:10:25,360 --> 06:10:26,560
Okay, I grabbed it.

10529
06:10:29,200 --> 06:10:30,020
Come back.

10530
06:10:30,220 --> 06:10:30,520
Okay.

10531
06:10:31,560 --> 06:10:32,560
Give me a sec.

10532
06:10:32,600 --> 06:10:33,420
I'm making gold.

10533
06:10:34,200 --> 06:10:35,660
I don't see anyone around.

10534
06:10:36,660 --> 06:10:37,200
Alright.

10535
06:10:38,060 --> 06:10:39,060
Is there anyone up here?

10536
06:10:39,380 --> 06:10:39,640
Hello?

10537
06:10:40,340 --> 06:10:40,820
No?

10538
06:10:41,040 --> 06:10:41,260
Okay.

10539
06:10:42,440 --> 06:10:42,860
Alright.

10540
06:10:45,560 --> 06:10:46,460
Where are we going?

10541
06:10:47,000 --> 06:10:48,580
I think we can go around it.

10542
06:10:49,500 --> 06:10:49,820
Alright.

10543
06:10:50,520 --> 06:10:52,260
Where are the fortresses across at?

10544
06:10:52,600 --> 06:10:54,420
Well, we'll go around it eventually.

10545
06:10:54,420 --> 06:10:55,240
Here, hold on.

10546
06:10:55,300 --> 06:10:56,780
I have more gold nuggies for you.

10547
06:10:56,980 --> 06:10:57,440
Oh my god.

10548
06:10:57,440 --> 06:10:57,900
Yeah, I need some.

10549
06:10:57,920 --> 06:10:58,720
Oh my god, that guy.

10550
06:10:58,920 --> 06:10:59,700
You didn't notice, right?

10551
06:10:59,760 --> 06:11:00,240
You didn't see anything?

10552
06:11:01,400 --> 06:11:02,840
Well, does he... No, he's okay.

10553
06:11:03,280 --> 06:11:04,620
Can we give him the gold now?

10554
06:11:04,780 --> 06:11:05,700
Yeah, give him the gold now.

10555
06:11:06,740 --> 06:11:07,360
Let's see what he gives us.

10556
06:11:07,360 --> 06:11:07,620
Over there.

10557
06:11:08,080 --> 06:11:09,080
Give us stuff, please.

10558
06:11:09,400 --> 06:11:11,580
This is a safe-ish area, so...

10559
06:11:13,920 --> 06:11:14,600
What?

10560
06:11:16,140 --> 06:11:16,820
Crystal?

10561
06:11:19,240 --> 06:11:20,940
That guy is snorting enviously.

10562
06:11:21,320 --> 06:11:25,320
Piglet snorts and the child is jealous.

10563
06:11:26,100 --> 06:11:28,340
Why did he make all those noises?

10564
06:11:28,800 --> 06:11:29,880
What is that?

10565
06:11:31,440 --> 06:11:33,920
Oh, he got the leather.

10566
06:11:34,340 --> 06:11:36,080
I was like, that happens?

10567
06:11:36,480 --> 06:11:37,340
What was that?

10568
06:11:37,720 --> 06:11:38,380
That was impressive.

10569
06:11:38,800 --> 06:11:40,860
That was... I've never heard that sound before.

10570
06:11:40,860 --> 06:11:42,120
Oh, he gave me more arrows.

10571
06:11:44,300 --> 06:11:45,800
So if you need some, let me know.

10572
06:11:46,640 --> 06:11:49,460
Oh my god, only... Does the nether bring us together?

10573
06:11:51,480 --> 06:11:54,640
We're finally... We're working together in the nether.

10574
06:11:57,760 --> 06:12:00,280
We've never worked together until now.

10575
06:12:01,420 --> 06:12:03,780
We have one common enemy and it's the nether.

10576
06:12:04,200 --> 06:12:05,720
Oh my god.

10577
06:12:06,160 --> 06:12:08,840
I just realized my game volume might have been really loud.

10578
06:12:12,120 --> 06:12:14,300
Guys, has my game volume been very loud?

10579
06:12:14,380 --> 06:12:15,140
I don't know.

10580
06:12:16,400 --> 06:12:17,220
You have any more?

10581
06:12:17,940 --> 06:12:18,560
Oh, there's end...

10582
06:12:18,560 --> 06:12:20,640
She gave us two enderpearls!

10583
06:12:21,280 --> 06:12:21,840
Let's go!

10584
06:12:23,460 --> 06:12:24,260
Three enderpearls!

10585
06:12:26,960 --> 06:12:28,240
Oh my god, let's go.

10586
06:12:28,400 --> 06:12:29,020
Oh, it was okay?

10587
06:12:29,260 --> 06:12:30,560
Okay, that's good to know.

10588
06:12:31,100 --> 06:12:32,120
I was scared there.

10589
06:12:33,040 --> 06:12:34,780
I saw it, I was like, wait, that's a lot.

10590
06:12:34,900 --> 06:12:36,160
How's my audio been?

10591
06:12:36,400 --> 06:12:37,000
Is it quiet?

10592
06:12:37,100 --> 06:12:37,660
Is it loud?

10593
06:12:37,660 --> 06:12:39,120
I don't know anyway.

10594
06:12:39,200 --> 06:12:40,220
Is this obsidian over there?

10595
06:12:40,600 --> 06:12:41,380
Or blackstone?

10596
06:12:41,900 --> 06:12:42,240
Where?

10597
06:12:44,540 --> 06:12:45,960
Oh, I picked up something.

10598
06:12:46,280 --> 06:12:47,840
I don't know what I picked up.

10599
06:12:49,520 --> 06:12:51,000
I don't know anymore.

10600
06:12:53,800 --> 06:12:54,240
Okay.

10601
06:12:55,720 --> 06:12:57,000
No, I don't want blackstone.

10602
06:12:57,000 --> 06:12:58,140
Oh, they're freaking out again.

10603
06:12:58,500 --> 06:12:59,420
They're freaking out.

10604
06:12:59,520 --> 06:13:00,300
They're jealous again.

10605
06:13:00,500 --> 06:13:01,100
Oh, what are they?

10606
06:13:01,180 --> 06:13:01,640
What the hell?

10607
06:13:01,720 --> 06:13:02,740
They're dropping like...

10608
06:13:02,740 --> 06:13:03,380
What is this?

10609
06:13:04,860 --> 06:13:05,700
Soul speed?

10610
06:13:05,780 --> 06:13:06,520
We don't need that.

10611
06:13:06,520 --> 06:13:07,280
Oh, we don't need that.

10612
06:13:07,900 --> 06:13:08,540
What's the other one?

10613
06:13:09,000 --> 06:13:09,660
That's iron.

10614
06:13:09,880 --> 06:13:10,660
Oh, that's my iron.

10615
06:13:14,000 --> 06:13:15,580
Are they both soul speed?

10616
06:13:16,300 --> 06:13:17,220
I think so.

10617
06:13:17,380 --> 06:13:18,880
I think they always bring out soul speed.

10618
06:13:20,080 --> 06:13:21,400
Is this also soul speed?

10619
06:13:21,680 --> 06:13:23,560
Yeah, it's both soul speed.

10620
06:13:23,700 --> 06:13:23,900
Okay.

10621
06:13:24,140 --> 06:13:24,440
Alright.

10622
06:13:25,140 --> 06:13:26,620
I'm ready to leave.

10623
06:13:26,740 --> 06:13:27,820
Onwards, this way.

10624
06:13:28,600 --> 06:13:29,080
Onwards.

10625
06:13:31,100 --> 06:13:31,580
Onwards.

10626
06:13:33,240 --> 06:13:35,820
Alright, let's try and go around this...

10627
06:13:36,640 --> 06:13:37,440
heckin' forest.

10628
06:13:37,540 --> 06:13:38,520
I hate this thing.

10629
06:13:40,040 --> 06:13:40,440
Okay.

10630
06:13:44,560 --> 06:13:47,600
What's the song that they've been listening to 24-7?

10631
06:13:48,220 --> 06:13:50,440
It's my original song, so they better like it.

10632
06:13:54,380 --> 06:13:56,920
Actually, we can probably build a bridge over this way.

10633
06:13:57,480 --> 06:13:59,040
Oh, never mind.

10634
06:13:59,140 --> 06:14:00,100
I just heard a ghast.

10635
06:14:00,100 --> 06:14:02,520
Never mind, I thought we were safe!

10636
06:14:04,400 --> 06:14:05,240
They're to our left.

10637
06:14:05,560 --> 06:14:07,240
The ghast is above us to the left.

10638
06:14:07,700 --> 06:14:09,060
Oh, you know what that means.

10639
06:14:09,100 --> 06:14:10,880
It's time to go through your favorite forest.

10640
06:14:11,880 --> 06:14:14,500
It's time to go through your favorite forest.

10641
06:14:15,000 --> 06:14:17,840
Where is it?

10642
06:14:18,340 --> 06:14:19,260
It's behind us.

10643
06:14:19,520 --> 06:14:21,460
He literally spawned inside.

10644
06:14:26,000 --> 06:14:27,420
He's right there.

10645
06:14:27,660 --> 06:14:28,560
He's right there.

10646
06:14:28,560 --> 06:14:30,760
He's right there in the cubbyhole.

10647
06:14:30,940 --> 06:14:31,700
In the cubbyhole?

10648
06:14:31,900 --> 06:14:32,600
There's a cubbyhole?

10649
06:14:32,700 --> 06:14:33,380
What are you talking about?

10650
06:14:33,860 --> 06:14:34,480
He's right there.

10651
06:14:34,600 --> 06:14:36,120
If you go straight you'll see him.

10652
06:14:36,140 --> 06:14:36,680
You wanna look at him?

10653
06:14:36,740 --> 06:14:37,920
Come on, I'll show you.

10654
06:14:38,100 --> 06:14:39,400
I'll show you.

10655
06:14:41,060 --> 06:14:41,880
Go in straight.

10656
06:14:42,440 --> 06:14:42,800
Straight?

10657
06:14:43,040 --> 06:14:43,180
Here?

10658
06:14:43,440 --> 06:14:44,540
Yeah, just go straight.

10659
06:14:44,620 --> 06:14:45,260
There he is.

10660
06:14:45,560 --> 06:14:47,540
There he is!

10661
06:14:47,700 --> 06:14:48,600
In the cubbyhole!

10662
06:14:53,310 --> 06:14:54,410
I told you.

10663
06:14:54,550 --> 06:14:55,530
You didn't believe me.

10664
06:14:57,930 --> 06:14:59,610
Oh, I flung it back at him!

10665
06:15:01,090 --> 06:15:02,730
You didn't believe me.

10666
06:15:02,950 --> 06:15:03,250
No!

10667
06:15:03,430 --> 06:15:04,310
I told you.

10668
06:15:04,510 --> 06:15:06,010
It was in the cubbyhole.

10669
06:15:06,170 --> 06:15:07,810
Oh my god, I can't stop moving!

10670
06:15:12,130 --> 06:15:13,550
Oh my god, I'm stuck!

10671
06:15:13,750 --> 06:15:13,950
I'm stuck!

10672
06:15:14,090 --> 06:15:14,270
I'm stuck!

10673
06:15:14,970 --> 06:15:16,650
I got you.

10674
06:15:17,030 --> 06:15:17,550
My turn.

10675
06:15:20,290 --> 06:15:23,730
Ok, nice.

10676
06:15:24,690 --> 06:15:25,770
Did you drop anything?

10677
06:15:26,270 --> 06:15:26,270
No.

10678
06:15:26,770 --> 06:15:28,450
I don't know, I'm taking your arrows though.

10679
06:15:28,930 --> 06:15:29,830
Yeah, go take my arrows.

10680
06:15:30,270 --> 06:15:32,410
Alright, it's time to go through the forest.

10681
06:15:32,530 --> 06:15:33,830
I kept hitting the things!

10682
06:15:34,810 --> 06:15:36,150
No, not the forest!

10683
06:15:36,570 --> 06:15:38,190
It's time to go through the forest!

10684
06:15:38,810 --> 06:15:39,530
Oh my god.

10685
06:15:39,710 --> 06:15:40,630
Into the thick of it!

10686
06:15:41,270 --> 06:15:42,270
Into the thick of it!

10687
06:15:42,950 --> 06:15:43,850
Into the thick of it!

10688
06:15:44,290 --> 06:15:46,990
Hey, what are you doing?

10689
06:15:49,490 --> 06:15:50,670
Why are you going up?

10690
06:15:51,710 --> 06:15:53,090
I'm going to climb the trees.

10691
06:15:53,270 --> 06:15:53,710
Oh, ok.

10692
06:15:53,750 --> 06:15:54,710
We're climbing the trees.

10693
06:15:55,210 --> 06:15:56,430
You can't climb the trees.

10694
06:15:56,470 --> 06:15:58,490
Yes, they actually can spawn up here.

10695
06:15:58,490 --> 06:16:00,130
Yeah, they can spawn here.

10696
06:16:00,170 --> 06:16:01,230
No, don't say that.

10697
06:16:01,330 --> 06:16:02,110
Don't say that.

10698
06:16:02,110 --> 06:16:02,890
I will say it.

10699
06:16:02,990 --> 06:16:03,910
I will say it because it's true.

10700
06:16:04,330 --> 06:16:07,910
Because then they'll start spawning in the trees and then it's your fault.

10701
06:16:08,030 --> 06:16:09,230
Have your shield up.

10702
06:16:09,670 --> 06:16:10,350
Where are you?

10703
06:16:11,150 --> 06:16:12,530
I'm in the trees.

10704
06:16:13,030 --> 06:16:14,670
I'm in your walls.

10705
06:16:14,850 --> 06:16:16,530
I mean, you're right below me.

10706
06:16:16,710 --> 06:16:17,770
Oh, you're actually that high?

10707
06:16:18,350 --> 06:16:19,490
Oh, I see one.

10708
06:16:20,550 --> 06:16:21,230
Where at?

10709
06:16:22,170 --> 06:16:22,890
Oh, I see you.

10710
06:16:26,350 --> 06:16:29,110
If I stay high ground, they can't get me.

10711
06:16:29,570 --> 06:16:32,570
If I stay up here, they can't get me.

10712
06:16:35,170 --> 06:16:36,470
I'm trying to save you.

10713
06:16:36,530 --> 06:16:37,830
Cinematic mode!

10714
06:16:38,190 --> 06:16:39,030
Let's go!

10715
06:16:40,110 --> 06:16:44,750
If we die in this run, we have to do all of this again.

10716
06:16:45,070 --> 06:16:45,670
All of this again.

10717
06:16:46,370 --> 06:16:47,930
Just every single seed.

10718
06:16:48,010 --> 06:16:50,370
But what if we get like the best seed, you know?

10719
06:16:50,370 --> 06:16:51,630
And it's like super lucky.

10720
06:16:52,190 --> 06:16:53,290
All of this again.

10721
06:16:53,650 --> 06:16:56,470
What if we get like a seed that like...

10722
06:16:56,470 --> 06:16:57,910
Is that the fortress over there?

10723
06:16:58,870 --> 06:16:59,350
Where?

10724
06:16:59,950 --> 06:17:00,650
Over there!

10725
06:17:01,130 --> 06:17:03,770
What is those vine things?

10726
06:17:04,650 --> 06:17:05,630
Vine things?

10727
06:17:06,190 --> 06:17:06,990
Did you see that?

10728
06:17:07,270 --> 06:17:10,710
That's the blue area with all the endermen.

10729
06:17:16,400 --> 06:17:17,960
That's the blue area.

10730
06:17:18,200 --> 06:17:21,320
I thought they were like, I don't know, chains or something.

10731
06:17:21,320 --> 06:17:23,320
Chains from the fortress.

10732
06:17:24,160 --> 06:17:24,900
I don't know.

10733
06:17:25,040 --> 06:17:26,140
I'm just...

10734
06:17:26,140 --> 06:17:28,800
I'm just trying to be...

10735
06:17:28,800 --> 06:17:31,780
Have like some optimism these days.

10736
06:17:31,820 --> 06:17:33,380
But now I'm just...

10737
06:17:33,380 --> 06:17:35,100
I'm a soulless husk right now.

10738
06:17:35,160 --> 06:17:37,200
Now I know why there's so many ghasts here.

10739
06:17:37,520 --> 06:17:39,860
They're all people who are trying to play hardcore Minecraft.

10740
06:17:40,060 --> 06:17:41,680
But they couldn't find the fucking...

10741
06:17:41,680 --> 06:17:43,560
They couldn't find...

10742
06:17:43,560 --> 06:17:44,860
The fucking...

10743
06:17:44,860 --> 06:17:46,140
The fortress.

10744
06:17:46,500 --> 06:17:48,520
I'm gonna...

10745
06:17:48,520 --> 06:17:49,220
Excuse me, sir.

10746
06:17:49,540 --> 06:17:51,860
Should we take a boat down here?

10747
06:17:52,380 --> 06:17:53,720
Oh, um...

10748
06:17:53,720 --> 06:17:55,640
Wait, I'm just checking out the area first.

10749
06:17:56,840 --> 06:17:57,480
Right here.

10750
06:17:58,040 --> 06:17:59,220
Right here where I'm standing.

10751
06:17:59,480 --> 06:18:01,520
I think this is the perfect boat area.

10752
06:18:02,200 --> 06:18:02,960
Might be.

10753
06:18:03,120 --> 06:18:04,040
I'm gonna come with you.

10754
06:18:05,960 --> 06:18:06,920
Oh, God.

10755
06:18:07,700 --> 06:18:09,980
For anyone going to bed, good night.

10756
06:18:10,140 --> 06:18:10,680
Good night.

10757
06:18:11,800 --> 06:18:14,900
You can check the VOD time in the morning.

10758
06:18:15,480 --> 06:18:17,040
Oh, there you are.

10759
06:18:17,220 --> 06:18:17,840
I went the wrong way.

10760
06:18:19,040 --> 06:18:20,660
Wait, how do I get up to you?

10761
06:18:21,100 --> 06:18:21,600
Oh, nevermind.

10762
06:18:22,860 --> 06:18:23,480
Alright, ready?

10763
06:18:23,800 --> 06:18:25,440
No, I'm not even by you.

10764
06:18:26,140 --> 06:18:26,500
I know.

10765
06:18:26,780 --> 06:18:29,620
Oh, my God.

10766
06:18:29,820 --> 06:18:31,760
Why did you position it like this?

10767
06:18:32,040 --> 06:18:32,800
Are you ready?

10768
06:18:34,440 --> 06:18:35,880
This is our only boat.

10769
06:18:36,860 --> 06:18:37,740
Come on in.

10770
06:18:37,900 --> 06:18:38,360
Are you in?

10771
06:18:38,620 --> 06:18:39,400
I know.

10772
06:18:40,000 --> 06:18:41,200
Wait, let me double check.

10773
06:18:41,200 --> 06:18:43,200
Okay, this is actually...

10774
06:18:43,200 --> 06:18:46,260
This is gonna be crazy if we make it.

10775
06:18:47,780 --> 06:18:51,900
I can't see very well, so...

10776
06:18:52,500 --> 06:18:53,540
Here we go.

10777
06:18:53,980 --> 06:18:55,360
This is a 50-50.

10778
06:18:55,580 --> 06:18:57,660
If we make it, it'll be fucking wild.

10779
06:18:58,480 --> 06:18:59,640
Oh, my God.

10780
06:18:59,720 --> 06:19:00,300
Thank God.

10781
06:19:00,740 --> 06:19:02,020
Anyway, turn around.

10782
06:19:02,580 --> 06:19:04,480
Oh, my God.

10783
06:19:05,780 --> 06:19:07,080
Oh, my God.

10784
06:19:07,140 --> 06:19:08,760
Well, we could've landed down there.

10785
06:19:08,760 --> 06:19:11,120
Anyway, there's two pigs in our boat now.

10786
06:19:11,220 --> 06:19:11,920
So, I'm scared.

10787
06:19:12,080 --> 06:19:13,000
Oh, what the hell?

10788
06:19:13,100 --> 06:19:14,920
These guys are such freeloaders.

10789
06:19:15,080 --> 06:19:16,580
I don't know.

10790
06:19:16,680 --> 06:19:18,360
I don't know if I wanna hit that.

10791
06:19:18,920 --> 06:19:20,180
No, we need this boat.

10792
06:19:20,340 --> 06:19:21,140
We need it.

10793
06:19:22,320 --> 06:19:23,200
Okay, okay.

10794
06:19:23,520 --> 06:19:26,880
I already experienced my first pig invasion.

10795
06:19:27,680 --> 06:19:28,580
Use the pig.

10796
06:19:29,000 --> 06:19:30,420
Wait, am I getting...

10797
06:19:30,420 --> 06:19:31,820
No, I don't wanna get one guy.

10798
06:19:32,220 --> 06:19:33,900
Should the pig be good?

10799
06:19:36,160 --> 06:19:37,540
Oh, I have a lot of wood.

10800
06:19:37,600 --> 06:19:38,320
We can make another...

10801
06:19:38,320 --> 06:19:39,540
Do you have a crafting table?

10802
06:19:39,920 --> 06:19:41,520
Okay, we can just make another one.

10803
06:19:41,640 --> 06:19:42,160
It's fine.

10804
06:19:42,400 --> 06:19:43,340
Abandon ship.

10805
06:19:44,440 --> 06:19:45,240
Abandon ship.

10806
06:19:47,720 --> 06:19:48,860
Oh, okay.

10807
06:19:52,820 --> 06:19:53,320
Okay.

10808
06:19:54,020 --> 06:19:56,640
A boat.

10809
06:20:00,060 --> 06:20:01,180
Okay, I threw it.

10810
06:20:01,900 --> 06:20:02,460
It's yours?

10811
06:20:03,020 --> 06:20:04,000
Grab it.

10812
06:20:04,000 --> 06:20:04,580
Grab it.

10813
06:20:05,040 --> 06:20:05,440
There you go.

10814
06:20:06,360 --> 06:20:07,560
Hold on, I gotta eat.

10815
06:20:09,560 --> 06:20:10,820
Okay, what's the plan?

10816
06:20:11,320 --> 06:20:12,740
I think the...

10817
06:20:12,740 --> 06:20:14,040
We can go through this forest.

10818
06:20:14,180 --> 06:20:15,680
This is just the one with all the endermen.

10819
06:20:16,220 --> 06:20:16,500
Yeah.

10820
06:20:17,180 --> 06:20:18,080
We go to the right.

10821
06:20:21,060 --> 06:20:22,100
Don't look at them.

10822
06:20:22,180 --> 06:20:24,160
Oh, watch out because there is a guy down there.

10823
06:20:24,240 --> 06:20:24,660
Hold on.

10824
06:20:27,660 --> 06:20:29,460
Oh my god, another ghast?

10825
06:20:29,460 --> 06:20:30,460
Are you kidding me?

10826
06:20:30,860 --> 06:20:32,240
Why are they all here?

10827
06:20:32,360 --> 06:20:33,080
Why are they here?

10828
06:20:34,840 --> 06:20:36,100
This is so unfair.

10829
06:20:36,440 --> 06:20:39,000
They literally spawn in every biome.

10830
06:20:39,540 --> 06:20:40,460
Give us a break.

10831
06:20:40,800 --> 06:20:43,180
Why did they make this biome harder?

10832
06:20:43,280 --> 06:20:44,380
Why did they make nether harder?

10833
06:20:44,540 --> 06:20:45,540
I don't understand.

10834
06:20:48,860 --> 06:20:49,340
What?

10835
06:20:49,600 --> 06:20:49,880
What happened?

10836
06:20:51,300 --> 06:20:52,060
There is a hole.

10837
06:20:52,440 --> 06:20:53,080
There is a hole.

10838
06:20:54,200 --> 06:20:56,160
There is multiple holes.

10839
06:20:56,160 --> 06:20:57,260
There is a lot of holes.

10840
06:20:57,560 --> 06:20:58,920
I think I just aggroed a guy.

10841
06:20:59,500 --> 06:21:00,640
Wait, maybe not.

10842
06:21:00,920 --> 06:21:01,360
Maybe I am safe.

10843
06:21:02,280 --> 06:21:03,920
I thought I aggroed him.

10844
06:21:05,320 --> 06:21:08,540
There is multiple holes.

10845
06:21:08,840 --> 06:21:10,240
Watch out not to aggro a guy.

10846
06:21:10,500 --> 06:21:12,760
Or be ready to build your own shop.

10847
06:21:16,060 --> 06:21:17,660
Why is there so many?

10848
06:21:19,340 --> 06:21:20,220
Where are you?

10849
06:21:20,440 --> 06:21:20,960
Oh, there you are.

10850
06:21:21,540 --> 06:21:23,060
Don't be careful when you are looking down.

10851
06:21:23,060 --> 06:21:24,540
You could accidentally look at you.

10852
06:21:24,540 --> 06:21:24,760
I know.

10853
06:21:28,760 --> 06:21:30,140
Oh my god.

10854
06:21:30,180 --> 06:21:32,060
I don't want to accidentally look at you.

10855
06:21:32,180 --> 06:21:33,180
You are so ugly.

10856
06:21:33,780 --> 06:21:35,060
Boy, I think the Endermen are cute.

10857
06:21:35,380 --> 06:21:37,640
They are literally on this Tumblr sexy man list.

10858
06:21:38,100 --> 06:21:39,900
Wait, are they really?

10859
06:21:40,240 --> 06:21:41,280
I think so, aren't they?

10860
06:21:41,560 --> 06:21:42,560
How do you know?

10861
06:21:43,900 --> 06:21:45,180
How do you know that?

10862
06:21:45,580 --> 06:21:46,220
I don't know.

10863
06:21:46,500 --> 06:21:48,760
I have heard it before.

10864
06:21:48,760 --> 06:21:49,960
Oh, you heard it?

10865
06:21:50,020 --> 06:21:50,460
From who?

10866
06:21:51,080 --> 06:21:52,180
I don't know.

10867
06:21:52,340 --> 06:21:53,620
Someone who is an expert at it.

10868
06:21:53,640 --> 06:21:54,060
I don't know.

10869
06:21:54,860 --> 06:21:57,180
I thought they were.

10870
06:21:57,320 --> 06:21:57,840
Aren't they?

10871
06:21:58,420 --> 06:21:59,860
You don't know.

10872
06:22:00,080 --> 06:22:01,980
Aren't they on there with like...

10873
06:22:01,980 --> 06:22:02,720
What's his name?

10874
06:22:04,280 --> 06:22:04,780
Slenderman?

10875
06:22:06,660 --> 06:22:08,000
They are basically Slenderman.

10876
06:22:09,480 --> 06:22:10,740
I mean, I guess you are right.

10877
06:22:13,640 --> 06:22:15,740
My back is actually starting to hurt.

10878
06:22:15,740 --> 06:22:16,200
They are close.

10879
06:22:16,620 --> 06:22:18,360
There is a fortress over there.

10880
06:22:18,440 --> 06:22:21,940
Wait, is that a fortress over there?

10881
06:22:22,160 --> 06:22:23,760
No, I can't see.

10882
06:22:24,480 --> 06:22:24,700
Where?

10883
06:22:25,180 --> 06:22:25,980
I don't know.

10884
06:22:26,080 --> 06:22:28,380
Everything looks like a fortress to me.

10885
06:22:28,960 --> 06:22:31,040
Everything looks like a fortress.

10886
06:22:31,340 --> 06:22:35,980
I can't distinguish between what is a fortress and what isn't.

10887
06:22:36,600 --> 06:22:39,000
They all look like ones to me.

10888
06:22:39,380 --> 06:22:41,040
Yes, I think it is.

10889
06:22:41,200 --> 06:22:41,620
Where?

10890
06:22:41,620 --> 06:22:41,700
Where?

10891
06:22:44,260 --> 06:22:45,100
Where are you?

10892
06:22:46,340 --> 06:22:47,080
Where are you?

10893
06:22:49,580 --> 06:22:51,180
Just follow me.

10894
06:22:51,320 --> 06:22:52,620
Oh, there you are.

10895
06:22:55,080 --> 06:22:56,340
Do you actually think?

10896
06:22:57,180 --> 06:22:57,840
I don't know.

10897
06:22:58,040 --> 06:23:00,220
I don't know what I saw.

10898
06:23:00,620 --> 06:23:03,840
What did I see that I thought was a fortress?

10899
06:23:03,980 --> 06:23:04,560
I don't know.

10900
06:23:04,940 --> 06:23:09,080
I don't see one.

10901
06:23:09,080 --> 06:23:11,460
I see a... I saw a gas.

10902
06:23:12,280 --> 06:23:13,600
I don't think it was.

10903
06:23:13,780 --> 06:23:14,440
I don't think so.

10904
06:23:14,820 --> 06:23:17,080
I think even...

10905
06:23:17,600 --> 06:23:18,400
I don't think it was.

10906
06:23:18,400 --> 06:23:20,800
The chat's eyes were freaking out too.

10907
06:23:21,480 --> 06:23:24,600
I think even chat was seeing things.

10908
06:23:24,920 --> 06:23:27,000
It was like we are in the Sahara Desert.

10909
06:23:27,220 --> 06:23:28,020
I saw a mirage.

10910
06:23:28,120 --> 06:23:28,660
A mirage.

10911
06:23:29,960 --> 06:23:33,100
I saw a mirage.

10912
06:23:36,080 --> 06:23:36,520
Um...

10913
06:23:36,520 --> 06:23:38,660
This is the freakiest bridge I've ever built.

10914
06:23:39,100 --> 06:23:40,480
Because it's next to a gas.

10915
06:23:41,000 --> 06:23:41,500
A gas?

10916
06:23:42,480 --> 06:23:44,340
Yeah, there was a gas in front of us.

10917
06:23:44,680 --> 06:23:45,720
Where are you?

10918
06:23:46,140 --> 06:23:47,200
Wait, where did you go?

10919
06:23:47,520 --> 06:23:48,060
I don't know.

10920
06:23:48,260 --> 06:23:51,160
I was looking for the fortress and you disappeared.

10921
06:23:51,960 --> 06:23:53,560
No, where did you go?

10922
06:23:53,620 --> 06:23:53,960
Wait, wait.

10923
06:23:54,020 --> 06:23:54,800
Up, up, up, up, up.

10924
06:23:55,160 --> 06:23:55,940
Pulled up, pulled up.

10925
06:23:56,280 --> 06:23:57,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10926
06:23:57,920 --> 06:24:00,440
I'm gonna build the freakiest bridge.

10927
06:24:00,440 --> 06:24:01,620
Oh, uh...

10928
06:24:02,180 --> 06:24:04,340
I'm gonna build the most freaky bridge.

10929
06:24:04,520 --> 06:24:07,020
I don't... I don't... I look up and I see a tree.

10930
06:24:07,200 --> 06:24:07,320
Just go up.

10931
06:24:07,660 --> 06:24:08,180
Just go up.

10932
06:24:08,300 --> 06:24:10,120
You see my name tag, just go up.

10933
06:24:10,200 --> 06:24:11,460
I don't see your name tag.

10934
06:24:12,120 --> 06:24:12,980
So go up.

10935
06:24:13,100 --> 06:24:13,700
You look...

10936
06:24:13,700 --> 06:24:14,280
Oh, I see you.

10937
06:24:14,300 --> 06:24:17,720
Are you sure this is a good idea?

10938
06:24:18,180 --> 06:24:18,540
It's not.

10939
06:24:18,800 --> 06:24:19,940
I'm fucking...

10940
06:24:19,940 --> 06:24:21,340
I'm seeing things now.

10941
06:24:22,440 --> 06:24:24,020
It's not a good idea.

10942
06:24:24,140 --> 06:24:26,340
Are you sure this is a good idea?

10943
06:24:27,140 --> 06:24:29,340
You know what I think is even a worse idea?

10944
06:24:29,340 --> 06:24:29,940
What?

10945
06:24:31,620 --> 06:24:32,140
Okay.

10946
06:24:32,260 --> 06:24:32,440
Get in.

10947
06:24:32,800 --> 06:24:33,560
I'm getting in.

10948
06:24:33,780 --> 06:24:34,380
I'm getting in.

10949
06:24:34,980 --> 06:24:35,800
Get in.

10950
06:24:36,080 --> 06:24:36,560
I'm in.

10951
06:24:36,840 --> 06:24:37,480
I trust you.

10952
06:24:37,720 --> 06:24:39,800
I really don't trust you, but I'm trusting you.

10953
06:24:40,720 --> 06:24:41,240
Okay.

10954
06:24:41,500 --> 06:24:42,060
There we go.

10955
06:24:42,360 --> 06:24:43,160
Get that boat.

10956
06:24:44,060 --> 06:24:45,940
Look to your right.

10957
06:24:47,060 --> 06:24:48,160
I can't get out of it.

10958
06:24:48,220 --> 06:24:49,500
I have no more room.

10959
06:24:49,820 --> 06:24:50,580
Look to your right.

10960
06:24:54,560 --> 06:24:58,430
Yeah, that would've been...

10961
06:24:58,430 --> 06:24:58,830
Yeah.

10962
06:24:58,990 --> 06:25:01,410
Everything could've went wrong.

10963
06:25:01,890 --> 06:25:02,970
Yeah, probably.

10964
06:25:03,690 --> 06:25:04,710
Oh, God.

10965
06:25:04,910 --> 06:25:05,910
Oh, my God.

10966
06:25:07,930 --> 06:25:10,470
I'm living life by the edge now.

10967
06:25:10,870 --> 06:25:12,110
I don't...

10968
06:25:12,110 --> 06:25:14,850
We need to make progress.

10969
06:25:14,910 --> 06:25:18,530
And to make progress, we have to take risks.

10970
06:25:19,010 --> 06:25:20,430
I'm going through another sickness now.

10971
06:25:20,650 --> 06:25:22,650
I'm going through another sickness.

10972
06:25:23,050 --> 06:25:24,270
This is just...

10973
06:25:24,270 --> 06:25:26,530
This is the minds all over again.

10974
06:25:28,610 --> 06:25:30,570
Doki is so weak-minded.

10975
06:25:31,630 --> 06:25:33,450
She breaks so easily.

10976
06:25:34,930 --> 06:25:35,650
Take that.

10977
06:25:35,750 --> 06:25:37,430
Write that down in your notes, everybody.

10978
06:25:38,230 --> 06:25:39,690
I'm gonna mind break.

10979
06:25:40,370 --> 06:25:42,270
She mind breaks easily.

10980
06:25:44,110 --> 06:25:44,590
Okay.

10981
06:25:44,730 --> 06:25:45,850
Oh, that's not good.

10982
06:25:46,050 --> 06:25:48,270
I need... I don't have any more bricks.

10983
06:25:48,430 --> 06:25:48,870
I have some.

10984
06:25:49,510 --> 06:25:49,950
There we go.

10985
06:25:50,470 --> 06:25:52,270
Alright, it's your turn to make bridges.

10986
06:25:52,670 --> 06:25:53,710
This is your job now.

10987
06:25:53,710 --> 06:25:56,610
We'll just start mining some because I'm almost out too.

10988
06:25:59,210 --> 06:26:02,350
I mean, I do have other blocks but I was gonna save them.

10989
06:26:02,630 --> 06:26:03,810
I went to the right.

10990
06:26:03,930 --> 06:26:04,390
I see it.

10991
06:26:05,810 --> 06:26:07,550
Just mine some random ones.

10992
06:26:08,450 --> 06:26:09,510
Just get like a full stack.

10993
06:26:11,570 --> 06:26:12,430
I'm gonna get...

10994
06:26:14,190 --> 06:26:15,750
Truly, this is...

10995
06:26:15,750 --> 06:26:17,450
We're not going back home.

10996
06:26:17,530 --> 06:26:19,770
We're not going back home.

10997
06:26:19,790 --> 06:26:21,770
Well, I have two obsidian.

10998
06:26:22,050 --> 06:26:26,390
So if we get however many we need more, then...

10999
06:26:26,390 --> 06:26:28,150
We're never going.

11000
06:26:28,210 --> 06:26:30,190
We're never making our way home.

11001
06:26:30,630 --> 06:26:32,410
We're never making back home.

11002
06:26:32,410 --> 06:26:33,850
We never had a home.

11003
06:26:34,250 --> 06:26:36,230
Doki, we never had a home.

11004
06:26:36,750 --> 06:26:38,210
Yes, we did.

11005
06:26:38,630 --> 06:26:41,790
We had that lapis blocks.

11006
06:26:42,290 --> 06:26:44,410
Think about our lapis blocks.

11007
06:26:44,430 --> 06:26:45,930
We can get back to those.

11008
06:26:46,130 --> 06:26:49,090
Once we're on the surface, we can get anywhere we want to.

11009
06:26:49,210 --> 06:26:50,370
So far.

11010
06:26:51,350 --> 06:26:52,170
It's okay.

11011
06:27:05,750 --> 06:27:08,090
This is so unlucky.

11012
06:27:08,390 --> 06:27:10,530
Why have we not found a single fortress?

11013
06:27:13,050 --> 06:27:13,510
No!

11014
06:27:14,230 --> 06:27:16,530
We'll have to get all the diamond over again.

11015
06:27:16,630 --> 06:27:18,130
Please god, no.

11016
06:27:22,170 --> 06:27:24,470
This is the easy part at this rate.

11017
06:27:29,410 --> 06:27:31,390
I know you're behind me, okay?

11018
06:27:31,510 --> 06:27:32,470
Yeah, I'm behind you.

11019
06:27:32,870 --> 06:27:34,110
This is a cursed seed.

11020
06:27:34,350 --> 06:27:36,650
We should have known when we couldn't find a village.

11021
06:27:37,970 --> 06:27:39,390
No, I found villages.

11022
06:27:39,510 --> 06:27:43,250
Oh my gosh, imagine the first one we got was like, oh no, no, we're back in the blue area.

11023
06:27:43,350 --> 06:27:44,670
Doki, we're back in the blue area.

11024
06:27:44,970 --> 06:27:45,930
No, no, I see the bones.

11025
06:27:46,470 --> 06:27:48,670
If we go left, it'll be fine.

11026
06:27:48,670 --> 06:27:50,170
It's the forest!

11027
06:27:50,290 --> 06:27:51,470
Oh god!

11028
06:27:52,530 --> 06:27:54,690
If we go left, it'll be fine.

11029
06:27:54,870 --> 06:27:56,950
If we go left, it'll be fine.

11030
06:27:57,230 --> 06:27:57,850
Where'd you go?

11031
06:27:58,290 --> 06:28:00,870
I'm in the forest, I'm in your favorite place.

11032
06:28:00,910 --> 06:28:01,550
How'd you get in there?

11033
06:28:01,630 --> 06:28:02,730
Which way did you go?

11034
06:28:03,110 --> 06:28:03,550
Oh!

11035
06:28:03,690 --> 06:28:04,190
Oh my god.

11036
06:28:05,130 --> 06:28:05,510
I'm okay.

11037
06:28:06,310 --> 06:28:07,390
I'm right here.

11038
06:28:07,670 --> 06:28:08,370
I'm down.

11039
06:28:10,650 --> 06:28:11,130
Nevermind.

11040
06:28:13,530 --> 06:28:14,090
Oh, I see you.

11041
06:28:14,390 --> 06:28:15,490
I'm right here.

11042
06:28:15,490 --> 06:28:16,330
Hi.

11043
06:28:16,710 --> 06:28:18,090
I'm right here.

11044
06:28:20,090 --> 06:28:21,330
You're so funny.

11045
06:28:21,430 --> 06:28:23,250
We get pushed off the edge right here.

11046
06:28:23,550 --> 06:28:25,050
By some pigs, yeah.

11047
06:28:25,250 --> 06:28:26,490
We have our potions.

11048
06:28:27,110 --> 06:28:28,290
I'm gonna drink it.

11049
06:28:28,390 --> 06:28:29,250
Don't do it right now.

11050
06:28:30,030 --> 06:28:33,010
I'm gonna fucking drink it.

11051
06:28:33,230 --> 06:28:33,890
Don't do it!

11052
06:28:34,470 --> 06:28:36,190
Why are you gonna do it?

11053
06:28:36,210 --> 06:28:38,070
We're gonna die anyway!

11054
06:28:38,250 --> 06:28:39,050
No we're not!

11055
06:28:41,350 --> 06:28:43,430
I'm doing real parkour-sive...

11056
06:28:44,150 --> 06:28:45,090
Moves in here.

11057
06:28:48,690 --> 06:28:49,650
Come on.

11058
06:28:51,310 --> 06:28:52,950
Don't you wanna be a parkour master?

11059
06:28:53,530 --> 06:28:54,150
Okay, nevermind.

11060
06:28:54,210 --> 06:28:54,750
Don't go this way.

11061
06:28:54,890 --> 06:28:55,530
Don't follow me.

11062
06:28:55,850 --> 06:28:56,510
Don't follow me.

11063
06:28:58,090 --> 06:28:59,450
Where did you go?

11064
06:28:59,750 --> 06:29:00,650
I'm here, I'm down.

11065
06:29:01,590 --> 06:29:02,690
But we can't...

11066
06:29:02,690 --> 06:29:04,230
We have to make a bridge.

11067
06:29:04,450 --> 06:29:07,690
I have two blocks for this bridge.

11068
06:29:08,750 --> 06:29:09,870
Did you not mine more?

11069
06:29:10,590 --> 06:29:11,490
Mine 20.

11070
06:29:11,490 --> 06:29:12,730
I thought that was okay.

11071
06:29:12,770 --> 06:29:14,570
I told you to get a whole stack!

11072
06:29:15,170 --> 06:29:17,910
I told you to get a whole stack!

11073
06:29:19,690 --> 06:29:22,970
We've been in the desert for three hours!

11074
06:29:25,790 --> 06:29:27,750
Has it actually been three hours?

11075
06:29:27,870 --> 06:29:28,410
I don't know.

11076
06:29:28,490 --> 06:29:31,190
It feels like three hours at this point.

11077
06:29:31,410 --> 06:29:34,070
We were in the mines for two, I feel like.

11078
06:29:35,110 --> 06:29:36,910
It's been a six hour stream.

11079
06:29:36,910 --> 06:29:39,390
How long?

11080
06:29:39,530 --> 06:29:41,050
Oh god, six and a half!

11081
06:29:41,350 --> 06:29:43,270
We're not making any progress!

11082
06:29:44,310 --> 06:29:45,470
Oh my god!

11083
06:29:46,750 --> 06:29:49,150
We're not making any progress!

11084
06:29:51,110 --> 06:29:53,190
I don't understand!

11085
06:29:54,310 --> 06:29:55,870
Uh oh, there's big piggies here.

11086
06:29:57,650 --> 06:29:58,550
Oh, he's angry.

11087
06:29:58,750 --> 06:29:59,970
Oh shit, he's here.

11088
06:30:02,250 --> 06:30:04,830
He's actually coming up.

11089
06:30:04,830 --> 06:30:05,830
They try.

11090
06:30:06,090 --> 06:30:06,790
Where are you?

11091
06:30:07,950 --> 06:30:08,810
Are you behind me?

11092
06:30:11,970 --> 06:30:13,290
Oh, I see you.

11093
06:30:13,390 --> 06:30:14,850
I'm down here with the piggies.

11094
06:30:16,370 --> 06:30:18,350
I thought you were scared of the piggies.

11095
06:30:18,410 --> 06:30:19,090
Yeah, I hate them.

11096
06:30:19,270 --> 06:30:20,970
They're fine with shields, honestly.

11097
06:30:21,490 --> 06:30:22,190
Oh, here he comes.

11098
06:30:26,710 --> 06:30:28,270
I'll put the mushroom down.

11099
06:30:28,450 --> 06:30:29,790
Oh yeah, nice, nice, nice!

11100
06:30:29,850 --> 06:30:31,250
Put the mushroom down!

11101
06:30:31,250 --> 06:30:32,070
Yeah!

11102
06:30:33,910 --> 06:30:35,930
Yeah, get scared dummy!

11103
06:30:37,050 --> 06:30:38,470
Scared of a little mushroom!

11104
06:30:40,070 --> 06:30:41,950
Scared of a little mushroom!

11105
06:30:43,890 --> 06:30:45,410
Yeah, stupid!

11106
06:30:46,610 --> 06:30:47,610
You're so stupid.

11107
06:30:48,090 --> 06:30:49,490
There you go, here's another one.

11108
06:30:50,330 --> 06:30:53,230
Yeah, take it, take it.

11109
06:30:54,070 --> 06:30:56,270
That's right, eat your veggies!

11110
06:30:57,690 --> 06:30:59,630
Okay, I have more mushrooms for us.

11111
06:30:59,630 --> 06:31:00,790
Oh my god.

11112
06:31:01,010 --> 06:31:02,530
This is just hellish.

11113
06:31:02,610 --> 06:31:04,210
This is actual hell.

11114
06:31:04,410 --> 06:31:07,210
This is the real hell.

11115
06:31:07,570 --> 06:31:09,870
Who invented Minecraft hell?

11116
06:31:10,410 --> 06:31:12,530
Who invented this?

11117
06:31:13,250 --> 06:31:14,350
I'm gonna go back in time.

11118
06:31:14,570 --> 06:31:15,390
I will prevent...

11119
06:31:15,390 --> 06:31:18,530
I will prevent the nether ever being created.

11120
06:31:18,670 --> 06:31:22,870
I will prevent Notch from telling Minecraft to Microsoft so the nether would have never been created.

11121
06:31:22,930 --> 06:31:23,090
I don't think...

11122
06:31:23,090 --> 06:31:24,830
Wait, was Minecraft...

11123
06:31:24,830 --> 06:31:27,270
Was the nether from Notch or from Microsoft?

11124
06:31:27,270 --> 06:31:28,850
I don't know actually, that's what I was gonna say.

11125
06:31:28,910 --> 06:31:30,690
I don't know if this was Microsoft's idea.

11126
06:31:30,950 --> 06:31:32,410
I don't think they have any ideas.

11127
06:31:33,050 --> 06:31:33,650
Who is it?

11128
06:31:33,890 --> 06:31:35,070
Oh, it was Notch.

11129
06:31:35,630 --> 06:31:38,830
Notch would do this to us, of course.

11130
06:31:43,370 --> 06:31:44,350
Oh my god!

11131
06:31:45,150 --> 06:31:46,550
Okay, we're fine.

11132
06:31:49,210 --> 06:31:50,270
I got the boat.

11133
06:31:51,870 --> 06:31:52,530
I got the boat.

11134
06:31:53,590 --> 06:31:54,430
I got the boat.

11135
06:31:54,430 --> 06:31:55,250
Yeah, it'll be fine.

11136
06:31:55,310 --> 06:31:55,630
Yeah.

11137
06:31:59,330 --> 06:32:01,430
Oh my god, of course you make me do it.

11138
06:32:01,670 --> 06:32:02,310
Are you in?

11139
06:32:02,950 --> 06:32:03,410
Yeah.

11140
06:32:06,870 --> 06:32:07,350
Okay.

11141
06:32:08,490 --> 06:32:09,410
Oh my god.

11142
06:32:09,830 --> 06:32:12,990
I have the mushroom too, in case things go wrong.

11143
06:32:13,070 --> 06:32:13,850
Grab the boat!

11144
06:32:13,990 --> 06:32:14,690
Grab the boat!

11145
06:32:14,830 --> 06:32:15,850
I don't have any room.

11146
06:32:16,530 --> 06:32:18,590
Okay, we go... I feel like we should go forward.

11147
06:32:20,570 --> 06:32:21,950
Okay, what's forward?

11148
06:32:22,730 --> 06:32:24,010
It's like here.

11149
06:32:24,130 --> 06:32:25,570
There's no other way.

11150
06:32:26,010 --> 06:32:28,930
There's no other way in this hell.

11151
06:32:30,290 --> 06:32:31,950
It's literally hell.

11152
06:32:34,890 --> 06:32:35,670
Are you okay?

11153
06:32:36,530 --> 06:32:38,150
No, I'm not okay.

11154
06:32:38,890 --> 06:32:40,290
No, me too.

11155
06:32:41,750 --> 06:32:43,270
Oh my god, don't fall.

11156
06:32:43,450 --> 06:32:44,690
Actually, come down this way.

11157
06:32:44,750 --> 06:32:46,170
I think this way is easier.

11158
06:32:48,650 --> 06:32:49,210
Parkour.

11159
06:32:49,210 --> 06:32:50,210
Parkour.

11160
06:32:51,570 --> 06:32:52,470
Oh my god.

11161
06:32:53,070 --> 06:32:54,510
Why can't we find one?

11162
06:32:55,990 --> 06:32:56,630
Just...

11163
06:32:56,630 --> 06:32:57,670
And then we have to...

11164
06:32:58,930 --> 06:33:00,870
Survive in the fortress.

11165
06:33:02,090 --> 06:33:04,750
I feel like at that point...

11166
06:33:04,750 --> 06:33:05,790
We'll be okay.

11167
06:33:08,950 --> 06:33:10,410
Watch out, there's pig.

11168
06:33:11,010 --> 06:33:11,610
We were ready.

11169
06:33:12,570 --> 06:33:14,410
Oh wait, these are...

11170
06:33:14,410 --> 06:33:15,850
There's already some here.

11171
06:33:15,850 --> 06:33:17,490
There's some pink ones...

11172
06:33:17,490 --> 06:33:18,250
Or blue ones here.

11173
06:33:18,370 --> 06:33:19,430
I can't even get colors right.

11174
06:33:21,190 --> 06:33:22,850
We can kill him.

11175
06:33:22,950 --> 06:33:23,870
No, we're running.

11176
06:33:24,510 --> 06:33:25,210
No, I don't.

11177
06:33:26,150 --> 06:33:26,530
No.

11178
06:33:29,290 --> 06:33:30,750
To our left.

11179
06:33:32,130 --> 06:33:32,850
Oh my god.

11180
06:33:34,130 --> 06:33:36,190
Are you a Costco guy?

11181
06:33:36,310 --> 06:33:36,890
What is this?

11182
06:33:44,710 --> 06:33:45,830
That's a...

11183
06:33:45,830 --> 06:33:47,390
I don't remember what they say anymore.

11184
06:33:47,530 --> 06:33:47,850
I don't know.

11185
06:33:47,930 --> 06:33:48,450
Where'd you go?

11186
06:33:48,970 --> 06:33:49,970
I'm over here.

11187
06:33:50,190 --> 06:33:51,530
Where did you go?

11188
06:33:52,030 --> 06:33:53,130
I went left.

11189
06:33:53,230 --> 06:33:54,390
I see you, I see you.

11190
06:33:54,550 --> 06:33:55,630
Boom, baby!

11191
06:33:57,210 --> 06:33:58,970
Bring in the boom!

11192
06:33:59,730 --> 06:34:00,690
Oh, I see you, I see you.

11193
06:34:01,450 --> 06:34:03,010
Cause the other end is a dead end.

11194
06:34:04,330 --> 06:34:06,090
Nothing's a dead end when you can...

11195
06:34:06,090 --> 06:34:06,610
Oh shit!

11196
06:34:07,630 --> 06:34:09,430
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

11197
06:34:09,870 --> 06:34:10,310
Boom!

11198
06:34:11,030 --> 06:34:11,530
I got him.

11199
06:34:12,350 --> 06:34:12,870
Nice.

11200
06:34:13,990 --> 06:34:15,610
Yeah, nothing's a dead end...

11201
06:34:15,610 --> 06:34:17,310
when you can mine pick through it.

11202
06:34:17,470 --> 06:34:17,910
It's fine.

11203
06:34:18,850 --> 06:34:20,270
Okay, okay, okay.

11204
06:34:20,330 --> 06:34:21,110
That's what you say.

11205
06:34:22,150 --> 06:34:22,670
Boom!

11206
06:34:23,670 --> 06:34:24,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11207
06:34:26,750 --> 06:34:27,970
Oh my god.

11208
06:34:28,290 --> 06:34:29,050
No, don't come here.

11209
06:34:30,550 --> 06:34:30,890
Yeah.

11210
06:34:32,390 --> 06:34:33,770
Wait, does he not...

11211
06:34:33,770 --> 06:34:35,430
hit you even if there's a mushroom there?

11212
06:34:35,790 --> 06:34:36,710
He's too afraid.

11213
06:34:38,270 --> 06:34:38,910
Okay, nice.

11214
06:34:38,910 --> 06:34:39,430
Alright.

11215
06:34:40,610 --> 06:34:42,170
Okay, this is a dead end too.

11216
06:34:42,310 --> 06:34:44,190
We have to mine, Doki!

11217
06:34:44,310 --> 06:34:45,930
There's no such thing as a dead end!

11218
06:34:46,330 --> 06:34:47,470
Boom, baby!

11219
06:34:49,070 --> 06:34:51,050
We have to mine through!

11220
06:34:51,250 --> 06:34:52,030
10 gifted!

11221
06:34:52,230 --> 06:34:54,290
That's a 5 out of 5 boom!

11222
06:34:54,470 --> 06:34:54,990
Boom!

11223
06:34:54,990 --> 06:34:56,650
5 out of 5 booms!

11224
06:34:57,550 --> 06:34:58,070
Booms!

11225
06:35:02,070 --> 06:35:03,210
Come down this way.

11226
06:35:03,810 --> 06:35:04,110
See?

11227
06:35:04,410 --> 06:35:06,850
Look, you've conquered your fear...

11228
06:35:07,750 --> 06:35:09,470
No, I just hate this area.

11229
06:35:09,770 --> 06:35:10,870
I just hate everything!

11230
06:35:11,250 --> 06:35:12,390
I had no fear!

11231
06:35:12,650 --> 06:35:14,010
You conquered it!

11232
06:35:14,450 --> 06:35:16,730
I just have only hate!

11233
06:35:16,870 --> 06:35:17,670
There was no fear!

11234
06:35:18,630 --> 06:35:20,290
You did it!

11235
06:35:20,410 --> 06:35:21,450
Oh my god.

11236
06:35:21,730 --> 06:35:24,150
That's a 5 out of 5 booms, baby!

11237
06:35:25,890 --> 06:35:25,970
Boom!

11238
06:35:26,050 --> 06:35:26,650
Boom!

11239
06:35:27,450 --> 06:35:28,010
Boom!

11240
06:35:28,010 --> 06:35:28,210
Boom!

11241
06:35:31,130 --> 06:35:32,330
Minecraft guys!

11242
06:35:32,750 --> 06:35:33,130
Of course!

11243
06:35:33,130 --> 06:35:36,810
Of course we trade with...

11244
06:35:36,810 --> 06:35:37,470
What happened, Doki?

11245
06:35:37,990 --> 06:35:38,970
That was so scary.

11246
06:35:39,130 --> 06:35:40,590
They almost knocked us into the lava.

11247
06:35:40,930 --> 06:35:43,610
I just need you to know, they almost knocked you into the lava.

11248
06:35:44,070 --> 06:35:45,290
I saved us!

11249
06:35:45,890 --> 06:35:46,730
Boom, baby!

11250
06:35:48,210 --> 06:35:49,570
Bring in the boom!

11251
06:35:49,770 --> 06:35:51,330
Hoglin growling!

11252
06:35:54,890 --> 06:35:56,190
Wait, he comes back!

11253
06:35:57,730 --> 06:35:59,150
We need to leave at least one.

11254
06:35:59,670 --> 06:36:02,510
More fortress spawns on the positive side of the exit.

11255
06:36:02,510 --> 06:36:04,790
Did we go the wrong way?

11256
06:36:04,890 --> 06:36:05,550
What are you talking about?

11257
06:36:05,630 --> 06:36:06,530
I think that's cap.

11258
06:36:08,010 --> 06:36:10,430
We're at negative 1,000.

11259
06:36:11,670 --> 06:36:13,270
No, I think they're being stupid.

11260
06:36:14,150 --> 06:36:15,610
That's not true!

11261
06:36:16,030 --> 06:36:17,150
That can't be true!

11262
06:36:19,170 --> 06:36:20,490
Don't say that!

11263
06:36:20,830 --> 06:36:22,510
Because we're at negative 1,500.

11264
06:36:26,410 --> 06:36:28,350
We have gone so far.

11265
06:36:28,430 --> 06:36:29,770
We've definitely been in the positive.

11266
06:36:29,770 --> 06:36:31,610
Oh my God!

11267
06:36:31,650 --> 06:36:33,710
They almost knocked you into that lava.

11268
06:36:34,010 --> 06:36:35,010
I'm just saying.

11269
06:36:35,430 --> 06:36:37,170
I had my shield up.

11270
06:36:38,410 --> 06:36:39,790
Boom, baby!

11271
06:36:41,810 --> 06:36:43,270
Oh my God, and a ghast.

11272
06:36:43,790 --> 06:36:44,690
It is true.

11273
06:36:45,610 --> 06:36:47,810
Speedrunners don't use that.

11274
06:36:50,390 --> 06:36:51,450
Okay, guys.

11275
06:36:51,550 --> 06:36:52,170
Don't...

11276
06:36:52,170 --> 06:36:56,990
Why didn't anybody tell us this at the very beginning?

11277
06:36:56,990 --> 06:36:58,550
Guys, look.

11278
06:36:58,630 --> 06:36:59,650
This is not...

11279
06:37:00,170 --> 06:37:01,730
This is not our fault.

11280
06:37:04,630 --> 06:37:06,950
You guys could've told us that.

11281
06:37:06,950 --> 06:37:07,870
We're going west.

11282
06:37:07,970 --> 06:37:09,650
People were like, just go east-west.

11283
06:37:09,770 --> 06:37:11,830
We're going west, so...

11284
06:37:11,830 --> 06:37:12,890
Just mine on through.

11285
06:37:13,910 --> 06:37:15,690
Of course we're Minecraft guys.

11286
06:37:16,110 --> 06:37:19,530
We love trying to find the fortress in the nether.

11287
06:37:44,890 --> 06:37:46,510
Oh my God.

11288
06:37:46,850 --> 06:37:46,990
Oh my God.

11289
06:37:46,990 --> 06:37:49,390
If it was just a stream that was just like...

11290
06:37:49,390 --> 06:37:52,190
Don't give in trying to find the fortress.

11291
06:37:52,310 --> 06:37:53,430
That's one thing.

11292
06:37:53,430 --> 06:37:55,450
But no, we have to find the fortress.

11293
06:37:55,830 --> 06:37:57,170
We have to survive the fortress.

11294
06:37:57,390 --> 06:37:58,630
We have to leave the fortress.

11295
06:37:58,930 --> 06:38:00,430
We have to go to the end.

11296
06:38:00,550 --> 06:38:01,830
We have to fight the Ender Dragon!

11297
06:38:03,230 --> 06:38:04,050
Boom, baby.

11298
06:38:04,970 --> 06:38:06,370
Five out of five, boom!

11299
06:38:13,350 --> 06:38:16,730
No, apparently Google says it's true.

11300
06:38:17,450 --> 06:38:20,330
I don't... Google says that you can...

11301
06:38:20,330 --> 06:38:21,330
That like...

11302
06:38:21,330 --> 06:38:21,710
Oh my God.

11303
06:38:22,450 --> 06:38:23,730
You're like, you filled that hole.

11304
06:38:23,830 --> 06:38:24,650
I know.

11305
06:38:26,990 --> 06:38:28,410
Because Google says what?

11306
06:38:28,830 --> 06:38:31,570
Google says that like...

11307
06:38:31,570 --> 06:38:32,350
What was it?

11308
06:38:34,590 --> 06:38:38,190
That's the thing that says you can eat it, but it's like a bandage or whatever.

11309
06:38:38,730 --> 06:38:40,150
Oh yeah, because of the AI.

11310
06:38:41,310 --> 06:38:43,390
The Google AI shit is so wrong.

11311
06:38:43,390 --> 06:38:43,630
Yeah, glue!

11312
06:38:43,850 --> 06:38:45,050
Put glue on your pizza!

11313
06:38:47,130 --> 06:38:49,430
I don't feel so good about this area.

11314
06:38:49,430 --> 06:38:50,090
Oh, the dressing!

11315
06:38:50,270 --> 06:38:52,790
Yeah, it says the dressing you can put in your salad.

11316
06:38:52,990 --> 06:38:54,370
And then there's also a bandage.

11317
06:38:55,950 --> 06:38:56,390
Like...

11318
06:38:56,390 --> 06:38:59,190
I think we can make a bridge here.

11319
06:39:00,910 --> 06:39:01,350
Alright.

11320
06:39:02,630 --> 06:39:03,870
Or we could go up.

11321
06:39:04,070 --> 06:39:04,790
Do you want to go up?

11322
06:39:06,850 --> 06:39:08,330
But we're at 47.

11323
06:39:09,990 --> 06:39:11,630
47 where the fortress is?

11324
06:39:11,870 --> 06:39:13,650
I don't know where the fortress is!

11325
06:39:13,810 --> 06:39:16,070
Guys, is 47 a good for a fortress?

11326
06:39:16,070 --> 06:39:16,350
Fortress?

11327
06:39:18,230 --> 06:39:20,430
Double choc-chocolate cookie!

11328
06:39:24,030 --> 06:39:24,430
Boo!

11329
06:39:38,670 --> 06:39:41,190
Now I can see why hawk tool is funny.

11330
06:39:47,490 --> 06:39:48,970
We failed up.

11331
06:39:50,270 --> 06:39:51,650
You want to build up?

11332
06:39:52,110 --> 06:39:53,190
I don't know.

11333
06:39:53,370 --> 06:39:54,670
What do you want to do?

11334
06:39:56,030 --> 06:39:57,490
Build up or go straight?

11335
06:39:57,610 --> 06:39:58,610
I think we go straight.

11336
06:39:59,050 --> 06:40:00,550
Alright, let's do it.

11337
06:40:00,830 --> 06:40:02,070
We gotta keep going west.

11338
06:40:02,970 --> 06:40:05,130
Keep going west, eventually we'll hit it.

11339
06:40:05,330 --> 06:40:08,990
We either fall to our deaths or we fucking hit the jackpot.

11340
06:40:09,650 --> 06:40:12,150
Oh my god, the lava is glowing so much.

11341
06:40:12,190 --> 06:40:13,290
It's so beautiful, Doki.

11342
06:40:13,290 --> 06:40:14,590
I'm like a...

11343
06:40:14,590 --> 06:40:16,590
I'm like a moth to a flame.

11344
06:40:16,710 --> 06:40:18,370
I'm like a moth to a flame.

11345
06:40:20,110 --> 06:40:21,510
It's calling to us.

11346
06:40:21,530 --> 06:40:22,730
It's calling to us.

11347
06:40:23,430 --> 06:40:24,610
Let's go this way.

11348
06:40:25,690 --> 06:40:26,870
Take the jump.

11349
06:40:29,210 --> 06:40:30,190
Do it.

11350
06:40:30,370 --> 06:40:32,610
Your chat will think it's so funny.

11351
06:40:38,130 --> 06:40:40,830
Don't you guys want to make content?

11352
06:40:40,830 --> 06:40:43,610
You know you love content.

11353
06:40:44,710 --> 06:40:46,390
Take the jump.

11354
06:40:47,490 --> 06:40:48,610
Oh my god.

11355
06:40:49,770 --> 06:40:51,170
I'm getting sleepy.

11356
06:40:51,930 --> 06:40:53,470
Just give up right now.

11357
06:40:53,850 --> 06:40:54,510
Just give up.

11358
06:40:55,250 --> 06:40:57,070
Start a new seed.

11359
06:40:57,210 --> 06:41:01,310
A new seed will surely be easier than this one.

11360
06:41:01,830 --> 06:41:04,010
The next seed will be easier.

11361
06:41:06,990 --> 06:41:08,510
Start over.

11362
06:41:08,510 --> 06:41:09,770
Start over.

11363
06:41:09,950 --> 06:41:12,450
Start over again.

11364
06:41:13,410 --> 06:41:14,270
Go through the mine.

11365
06:41:15,190 --> 06:41:18,410
Strip mining was so much easier than the nether.

11366
06:41:19,550 --> 06:41:22,450
Don't you just want to do it over and over again?

11367
06:41:23,730 --> 06:41:24,930
Keep doing it.

11368
06:41:24,950 --> 06:41:29,450
Keep dying, restart.

11369
06:41:29,450 --> 06:41:30,670
Oh my god.

11370
06:41:35,150 --> 06:41:38,210
Why is the forest so far?

11371
06:41:38,570 --> 06:41:39,290
I don't know.

11372
06:41:39,410 --> 06:41:40,530
That's why I hate this area.

11373
06:41:40,650 --> 06:41:42,910
Because it's hard to navigate and it's huge.

11374
06:41:44,130 --> 06:41:47,030
Last time we were here, it wasn't this big.

11375
06:41:47,990 --> 06:41:49,510
We're in unknown territory.

11376
06:41:50,610 --> 06:41:53,010
We've been in unknown territory forever.

11377
06:41:53,630 --> 06:41:55,590
When does it start becoming known?

11378
06:41:55,590 --> 06:41:56,210
I don't know.

11379
06:42:00,710 --> 06:42:02,230
Where did you go?

11380
06:42:02,930 --> 06:42:05,210
I'm in front of you.

11381
06:42:05,290 --> 06:42:06,110
I'm in front of you.

11382
06:42:08,090 --> 06:42:09,370
What's in front of me?

11383
06:42:09,870 --> 06:42:11,230
Just go forward.

11384
06:42:12,630 --> 06:42:13,310
Oh, I see you.

11385
06:42:18,980 --> 06:42:20,660
I did the bridge.

11386
06:42:21,240 --> 06:42:22,500
I did the bridge.

11387
06:42:22,960 --> 06:42:24,880
This is the most painful.

11388
06:42:24,880 --> 06:42:26,360
This will...

11389
06:42:26,580 --> 06:42:29,880
Nothing ever would turn me off of Minecraft before now.

11390
06:42:39,860 --> 06:42:41,500
Oh my god.

11391
06:42:41,980 --> 06:42:44,600
Why is there so many?

11392
06:42:44,840 --> 06:42:47,040
It's the worst biome, I'm telling you.

11393
06:42:47,380 --> 06:42:48,220
You can't see shit.

11394
06:42:49,740 --> 06:42:51,160
You can't see shit.

11395
06:42:51,380 --> 06:42:53,340
And also, it goes on forever.

11396
06:42:54,880 --> 06:42:56,120
I didn't know.

11397
06:42:56,880 --> 06:42:58,740
You were like, let's go through the forest.

11398
06:42:59,100 --> 06:43:00,860
You hate the forest.

11399
06:43:01,060 --> 06:43:01,800
It's so fun.

11400
06:43:02,220 --> 06:43:03,440
This is why I hate the forest.

11401
06:43:03,820 --> 06:43:06,880
I was thinking like, what if...

11402
06:43:08,580 --> 06:43:10,380
There's a baby in front of you.

11403
06:43:13,180 --> 06:43:14,580
Baby is gonna be scared.

11404
06:43:14,680 --> 06:43:15,660
I got the mushrooms.

11405
06:43:16,540 --> 06:43:17,460
I'll kill him.

11406
06:43:18,660 --> 06:43:19,720
Did you kill the baby?

11407
06:43:20,060 --> 06:43:20,640
No, I didn't.

11408
06:43:21,440 --> 06:43:22,560
That's fucking right.

11409
06:43:22,620 --> 06:43:23,120
Look at that.

11410
06:43:23,280 --> 06:43:23,900
He's running.

11411
06:43:26,160 --> 06:43:27,280
That's fucking right.

11412
06:43:28,300 --> 06:43:30,160
You're scared of your vegetables?

11413
06:43:30,660 --> 06:43:31,380
That's right.

11414
06:43:31,820 --> 06:43:32,540
Get scared.

11415
06:43:33,740 --> 06:43:35,300
Your mother is dead.

11416
06:43:35,400 --> 06:43:36,060
We killed her.

11417
06:43:39,300 --> 06:43:40,400
Alright, where do we go?

11418
06:43:40,680 --> 06:43:41,160
Onward.

11419
06:43:41,580 --> 06:43:43,080
Go away, little baby.

11420
06:43:44,140 --> 06:43:47,260
We're gonna fucking kick the baby again.

11421
06:43:47,280 --> 06:43:48,980
We're still headed west.

11422
06:43:48,980 --> 06:43:51,280
We're still west.

11423
06:43:51,460 --> 06:43:53,380
What's the worst that can happen?

11424
06:43:56,520 --> 06:43:57,440
Are you okay?

11425
06:43:58,040 --> 06:44:00,020
Are you okay?

11426
06:44:00,480 --> 06:44:01,060
Are you okay?

11427
06:44:02,100 --> 06:44:04,280
I don't think okay is the right word.

11428
06:44:10,200 --> 06:44:11,300
Go west.

11429
06:44:11,880 --> 06:44:14,880
Eventually, if we keep going west, something will hit.

11430
06:44:15,420 --> 06:44:17,260
Why would they make it so that...

11431
06:44:17,260 --> 06:44:20,360
more fortresses spawn in the positive?

11432
06:44:20,560 --> 06:44:22,160
When does it circle back?

11433
06:44:23,120 --> 06:44:25,240
It has to circle back eventually.

11434
06:44:25,600 --> 06:44:27,380
I don't think you can circle back.

11435
06:44:27,780 --> 06:44:29,920
So we just turn around?

11436
06:44:31,360 --> 06:44:33,220
We gotta get obsidian.

11437
06:44:34,960 --> 06:44:36,580
Make another obsidian.

11438
06:44:36,960 --> 06:44:38,920
I don't know anymore.

11439
06:44:43,680 --> 06:44:46,220
Apparently, the x-axis thing was...

11440
06:44:46,220 --> 06:44:48,040
before 1.16.

11441
06:44:48,260 --> 06:44:49,220
So it's old news.

11442
06:44:50,120 --> 06:44:50,640
Wait,

11443
06:44:53,980 --> 06:44:54,540
hold on.

11444
06:44:54,680 --> 06:44:55,260
He said something else.

11445
06:44:55,720 --> 06:45:00,120
One fortress can spawn every 432x432 chunks.

11446
06:45:00,960 --> 06:45:03,460
Okay, we're fine then.

11447
06:45:03,600 --> 06:45:04,560
We can just keep going.

11448
06:45:06,300 --> 06:45:09,140
Your chat was trying to feed us wrong information, Doki.

11449
06:45:09,260 --> 06:45:10,840
They were trying to sabotage us for real.

11450
06:45:11,540 --> 06:45:12,040
Yes!

11451
06:45:12,040 --> 06:45:13,920
Your chat was saying the same thing!

11452
06:45:14,160 --> 06:45:14,800
No, it wasn't!

11453
06:45:16,500 --> 06:45:17,020
Wait,

11454
06:45:22,180 --> 06:45:22,540
what's this?

11455
06:45:23,340 --> 06:45:25,680
You give us the seed so we can look it for you?

11456
06:45:25,800 --> 06:45:26,080
No!

11457
06:45:27,300 --> 06:45:29,680
We're not cheaters!

11458
06:45:30,120 --> 06:45:31,820
We're not cheaters!

11459
06:45:32,480 --> 06:45:33,900
Come on, this way.

11460
06:45:34,740 --> 06:45:36,240
Come on, I'm here.

11461
06:45:36,500 --> 06:45:36,920
I'm here.

11462
06:45:37,340 --> 06:45:38,640
We're not cheaters.

11463
06:45:38,640 --> 06:45:40,220
We're here.

11464
06:45:40,420 --> 06:45:41,620
We're here.

11465
06:45:43,100 --> 06:45:43,700
Yippee!

11466
06:45:45,320 --> 06:45:45,920
Yippee!

11467
06:45:47,660 --> 06:45:48,260
Yippee!

11468
06:45:48,560 --> 06:45:49,160
Yippee!

11469
06:45:50,280 --> 06:45:50,880
Yippee!

11470
06:45:52,300 --> 06:45:54,720
We have integrity!

11471
06:45:55,460 --> 06:45:56,420
Take that, take that.

11472
06:45:56,700 --> 06:45:57,460
Oh wait, be careful.

11473
06:45:57,640 --> 06:45:58,560
Actually, maybe don't.

11474
06:46:00,440 --> 06:46:01,420
Too risky.

11475
06:46:04,500 --> 06:46:07,060
Wait, did you see the piglin snorted angrily?

11476
06:46:08,640 --> 06:46:09,720
He didn't notice though.

11477
06:46:09,900 --> 06:46:10,300
We're inside.

11478
06:46:10,960 --> 06:46:11,960
Yeah, we're inside.

11479
06:46:13,720 --> 06:46:15,460
I think we'll be fine.

11480
06:46:16,420 --> 06:46:17,680
Don't get tired.

11481
06:46:19,840 --> 06:46:20,820
I'm tired.

11482
06:46:21,520 --> 06:46:22,260
No, you're not.

11483
06:46:23,240 --> 06:46:24,300
No, you're not.

11484
06:46:25,020 --> 06:46:27,140
If we die, you gotta stay up.

11485
06:46:27,320 --> 06:46:28,940
If we die, you gotta stay up.

11486
06:46:29,300 --> 06:46:34,960
If we die, you gotta keep going.

11487
06:46:42,240 --> 06:46:43,540
Oh my gosh.

11488
06:46:43,540 --> 06:46:46,580
Hold on, I'm gonna go to the side and see if there's any...

11489
06:46:46,580 --> 06:46:48,750
any fortresses over yonder.

11490
06:46:50,320 --> 06:46:50,520
There's another...

11491
06:46:50,520 --> 06:46:52,340
There's another forest.

11492
06:46:52,680 --> 06:46:54,120
There's another forest.

11493
06:46:55,960 --> 06:46:58,820
Let's see if there's any fortresses yonder.

11494
06:47:00,260 --> 06:47:01,520
Oh my gosh.

11495
06:47:03,020 --> 06:47:04,260
Fortress blaze!

11496
06:47:04,440 --> 06:47:06,700
How the fuck did a chicken get here?

11497
06:47:06,700 --> 06:47:07,640
What the hell?

11498
06:47:07,780 --> 06:47:10,400
How is there another chicken guy here?

11499
06:47:10,680 --> 06:47:12,300
Is that fortress over there?

11500
06:47:12,700 --> 06:47:13,180
Where?

11501
06:47:14,120 --> 06:47:15,120
Over there.

11502
06:47:16,200 --> 06:47:18,320
Is this another mirage?

11503
06:47:18,600 --> 06:47:20,320
Am I looking at a mirage right now?

11504
06:47:20,340 --> 06:47:21,880
Everything looks like a fortress.

11505
06:47:22,420 --> 06:47:24,420
Is this a mirage?

11506
06:47:26,060 --> 06:47:26,820
I don't know.

11507
06:47:28,440 --> 06:47:30,060
I don't know.

11508
06:47:30,400 --> 06:47:34,600
I'm gonna keep my render distance the way it is because...

11509
06:47:34,600 --> 06:47:35,440
What is that?

11510
06:47:35,940 --> 06:47:37,120
Let's start selecting him.

11511
06:47:37,500 --> 06:47:38,040
What's what?

11512
06:47:38,240 --> 06:47:39,000
It's just land.

11513
06:47:39,040 --> 06:47:39,960
What's that over there?

11514
06:47:41,160 --> 06:47:42,660
It's more land.

11515
06:47:43,680 --> 06:47:45,560
There's a ghast behind us.

11516
06:47:47,240 --> 06:47:48,400
Oh, I see him.

11517
06:47:50,180 --> 06:47:52,740
I'm not ready to deal with his bullshit today.

11518
06:47:53,880 --> 06:47:55,020
Oh my god.

11519
06:47:56,360 --> 06:47:57,300
I got him.

11520
06:47:57,960 --> 06:47:59,280
You got him?

11521
06:47:59,480 --> 06:47:59,720
Nice.

11522
06:48:00,200 --> 06:48:01,140
I locked in.

11523
06:48:04,600 --> 06:48:05,500
I got him.

11524
06:48:06,540 --> 06:48:08,540
I got him.

11525
06:48:09,380 --> 06:48:13,960
Can you believe Doki wanted to start this later in the day?

11526
06:48:16,320 --> 06:48:17,800
I didn't realize.

11527
06:48:18,000 --> 06:48:19,020
Wait, is that...

11528
06:48:19,020 --> 06:48:20,640
Is that the fortress over there?

11529
06:48:20,640 --> 06:48:21,000
Stop!

11530
06:48:24,940 --> 06:48:26,220
Do you wanna go?

11531
06:48:26,600 --> 06:48:28,260
We can just build a bridge.

11532
06:48:28,540 --> 06:48:31,240
We can just build a bridge all the way there.

11533
06:48:31,240 --> 06:48:35,710
Come on.

11534
06:48:35,770 --> 06:48:37,390
We can build a bridge at sea.

11535
06:48:37,530 --> 06:48:38,650
Is it that over there?

11536
06:48:38,930 --> 06:48:41,650
Oh, it definitely is not, but we can go check.

11537
06:48:43,870 --> 06:48:47,170
I'm just trying something here.

11538
06:48:47,990 --> 06:48:49,150
I'm trying.

11539
06:48:49,390 --> 06:48:51,070
I'm trying something.

11540
06:48:51,830 --> 06:48:56,330
I'm like, somebody wants to just give up.

11541
06:48:57,660 --> 06:48:58,830
How are we doing?

11542
06:48:59,250 --> 06:49:01,950
I'm saying we build a...

11543
06:49:01,950 --> 06:49:02,050
Dude!

11544
06:49:03,370 --> 06:49:06,290
It's midnight for me, you west coaster!

11545
06:49:06,810 --> 06:49:07,890
You're a west coaster!

11546
06:49:23,130 --> 06:49:25,750
This is my first breakdown, okay?

11547
06:49:26,970 --> 06:49:29,590
Okay, I actually think we should build over there though.

11548
06:49:29,590 --> 06:49:30,390
Okay.

11549
06:49:31,210 --> 06:49:34,110
Because going over lava, it's high risk but high reward.

11550
06:49:34,330 --> 06:49:35,210
Oh, it's true.

11551
06:49:35,370 --> 06:49:36,570
You're so right.

11552
06:49:36,870 --> 06:49:38,750
We build a double bridge.

11553
06:49:38,970 --> 06:49:40,190
Wait, do you have enough things?

11554
06:49:40,870 --> 06:49:41,290
Yeah.

11555
06:49:41,590 --> 06:49:42,190
You do?

11556
06:49:44,890 --> 06:49:45,910
Where should we go?

11557
06:49:46,890 --> 06:49:48,570
I'm drinking fire resistance.

11558
06:49:49,210 --> 06:49:50,010
No, you're not.

11559
06:49:50,230 --> 06:49:51,730
Only drink it if you start falling.

11560
06:49:52,550 --> 06:49:55,210
I'm not gonna get it off in time!

11561
06:49:56,710 --> 06:49:58,030
Here I go.

11562
06:49:58,750 --> 06:49:59,590
Here you go.

11563
06:49:59,590 --> 06:50:00,250
Into the thick of it!

11564
06:50:01,050 --> 06:50:02,290
Into the thick of it!

11565
06:50:03,010 --> 06:50:03,990
Into the thick of it!

11566
06:50:04,570 --> 06:50:05,710
Into the thick of it!

11567
06:50:09,410 --> 06:50:11,210
My fingers get sweaty.

11568
06:50:13,230 --> 06:50:14,610
Into the thick of it!

11569
06:50:14,670 --> 06:50:18,310
Okay, you have to tell me if I'm gonna back into a lava thing though.

11570
06:50:20,050 --> 06:50:21,250
Just say stop.

11571
06:50:22,030 --> 06:50:23,250
Yeah, just tell me though.

11572
06:50:23,250 --> 06:50:24,650
Don't tell me to stop.

11573
06:50:25,230 --> 06:50:26,910
If I start going.

11574
06:50:29,390 --> 06:50:30,830
Looks like a bastion?

11575
06:50:31,130 --> 06:50:32,410
Oh my god!

11576
06:50:32,550 --> 06:50:33,370
Oh, it is!

11577
06:50:34,330 --> 06:50:36,510
No, I literally told you that earlier.

11578
06:50:38,410 --> 06:50:39,910
No way, there's a freaking...

11579
06:50:39,910 --> 06:50:43,070
We found two bastions but not a fortress!

11580
06:50:45,870 --> 06:50:47,650
This is so unfair!

11581
06:50:49,090 --> 06:50:51,150
I thought the bastions were the big piggies.

11582
06:50:52,090 --> 06:50:54,230
They're the most dangerous part.

11583
06:50:55,510 --> 06:50:56,930
All those guys in there?

11584
06:50:57,210 --> 06:50:58,830
Yeah, all those guys will kill you.

11585
06:51:00,150 --> 06:51:01,870
They don't care if you're wearing gold.

11586
06:51:04,150 --> 06:51:05,330
Yeah, they just attack.

11587
06:51:11,270 --> 06:51:13,050
I guess we go left.

11588
06:51:13,090 --> 06:51:14,250
You think it's the same one?

11589
06:51:14,310 --> 06:51:15,230
I don't think so.

11590
06:51:15,770 --> 06:51:17,590
There's no way.

11591
06:51:17,590 --> 06:51:19,410
No way, I think it is.

11592
06:51:19,490 --> 06:51:20,610
Do you see those blue flames?

11593
06:51:20,990 --> 06:51:22,150
Is that the bones?

11594
06:51:22,650 --> 06:51:25,850
We've gone too far for us to have made a circle.

11595
06:51:27,910 --> 06:51:28,930
Okay, turn around.

11596
06:51:29,130 --> 06:51:29,370
Turn around.

11597
06:51:30,990 --> 06:51:31,550
No.

11598
06:51:35,610 --> 06:51:36,130
No.

11599
06:51:36,790 --> 06:51:37,090
No.

11600
06:51:39,730 --> 06:51:41,410
I didn't think of it.

11601
06:51:41,850 --> 06:51:43,150
I didn't think of it.

11602
06:51:43,530 --> 06:51:45,030
I didn't think of it.

11603
06:51:45,030 --> 06:51:45,810
I didn't think of it.

11604
06:51:46,030 --> 06:51:48,050
I thought you were going left and right.

11605
06:51:49,150 --> 06:51:51,570
I didn't think of it.

11606
06:51:51,690 --> 06:51:53,950
Oh my god.

11607
06:51:54,090 --> 06:51:55,490
We made out just in time.

11608
06:51:55,670 --> 06:51:56,790
Holy shoot.

11609
06:51:57,430 --> 06:51:58,430
Oh my god.

11610
06:51:59,630 --> 06:52:01,210
Let's just keep going through the wood.

11611
06:52:01,370 --> 06:52:02,170
I don't care anymore.

11612
06:52:03,050 --> 06:52:04,790
I got the mushrooms.

11613
06:52:05,190 --> 06:52:08,070
I have nine mushrooms.

11614
06:52:09,230 --> 06:52:11,050
I didn't think of it.

11615
06:52:11,290 --> 06:52:13,190
I didn't think of it.

11616
06:52:13,190 --> 06:52:15,170
Why is he chasing after you?

11617
06:52:15,350 --> 06:52:16,090
Okay, that was weird.

11618
06:52:19,010 --> 06:52:19,650
Okay.

11619
06:52:20,550 --> 06:52:22,350
We're still going west everybody.

11620
06:52:23,290 --> 06:52:24,650
Turn it to the west.

11621
06:52:25,070 --> 06:52:26,570
Turn it to the west.

11622
06:52:27,670 --> 06:52:28,710
See this?

11623
06:52:31,670 --> 06:52:33,390
Be thwarted fool.

11624
06:52:34,210 --> 06:52:35,690
Now we have to get past him still though.

11625
06:52:37,450 --> 06:52:38,090
Boom!

11626
06:52:38,930 --> 06:52:41,130
Double chonky mushroom.

11627
06:52:46,760 --> 06:52:47,400
What?

11628
06:52:47,600 --> 06:52:48,240
Where'd you go?

11629
06:52:48,700 --> 06:52:49,580
Oh, you're up there.

11630
06:52:49,820 --> 06:52:51,420
I'm gonna crack.

11631
06:52:53,500 --> 06:52:54,620
I'm gonna crack.

11632
06:52:55,400 --> 06:52:57,100
I'm gonna crack.

11633
06:53:01,500 --> 06:53:02,640
It's okay.

11634
06:53:02,960 --> 06:53:04,260
Everything will be fine.

11635
06:53:05,060 --> 06:53:05,600
I got him.

11636
06:53:06,540 --> 06:53:07,280
I think.

11637
06:53:07,280 --> 06:53:07,360
I think.

11638
06:53:18,160 --> 06:53:19,860
Where'd you go?

11639
06:53:19,960 --> 06:53:21,920
Where are you?

11640
06:53:22,500 --> 06:53:23,060
I'm here.

11641
06:53:23,700 --> 06:53:25,340
Keep going straight.

11642
06:53:31,220 --> 06:53:32,660
I'm seeing...

11643
06:53:32,660 --> 06:53:35,140
All I see is red.

11644
06:53:35,140 --> 06:53:35,680
Red everywhere.

11645
06:53:37,500 --> 06:53:38,000
I don't understand.

11646
06:53:38,280 --> 06:53:40,680
I don't even know what fortresses look like anymore.

11647
06:53:40,840 --> 06:53:43,320
They're just really big red structures.

11648
06:53:44,100 --> 06:53:44,240
It's just a myth.

11649
06:53:44,720 --> 06:53:46,220
They aren't even real.

11650
06:53:46,500 --> 06:53:51,600
They were invented by a big crafter.

11651
06:53:51,600 --> 06:53:58,740
A big crafter.

11652
06:54:02,040 --> 06:54:06,440
Wait, I think we should stick to...

11653
06:54:08,480 --> 06:54:12,500
We should stick to the edge where we see the big pool of lava.

11654
06:54:12,500 --> 06:54:13,340
Okay.

11655
06:54:14,020 --> 06:54:14,780
What?

11656
06:54:19,520 --> 06:54:20,580
What are you even saying?

11657
06:54:23,300 --> 06:54:24,340
I know!

11658
06:54:24,620 --> 06:54:26,220
That's why I hate this bio!

11659
06:54:26,860 --> 06:54:29,380
I hate this bio so much!

11660
06:54:36,800 --> 06:54:38,680
Oh my god.

11661
06:54:38,680 --> 06:54:41,820
A bastion is tempting, but...

11662
06:54:41,820 --> 06:54:42,860
It is not our goal.

11663
06:54:43,460 --> 06:54:44,500
It's not our goal.

11664
06:54:46,680 --> 06:54:48,440
Oh my god, please.

11665
06:54:49,060 --> 06:54:49,800
If there...

11666
06:54:49,800 --> 06:54:52,680
I went to heaven, but if there is a god...

11667
06:54:54,060 --> 06:54:54,940
Oh my gosh.

11668
06:54:55,900 --> 06:54:57,060
Oh, please.

11669
06:55:00,520 --> 06:55:01,280
What the hell?

11670
06:55:01,360 --> 06:55:02,060
Who just yelled at me?

11671
06:55:03,280 --> 06:55:03,780
Where are you?

11672
06:55:04,080 --> 06:55:04,880
I'm over there.

11673
06:55:04,880 --> 06:55:05,660
Oh, I see you.

11674
06:55:08,580 --> 06:55:09,420
I'm checking.

11675
06:55:09,600 --> 06:55:10,880
I'm being on the lookout for...

11676
06:55:12,960 --> 06:55:14,040
For vortices!

11677
06:55:14,780 --> 06:55:15,920
Into the thick of it.

11678
06:55:17,580 --> 06:55:18,700
Into the thick of it.

11679
06:55:25,060 --> 06:55:26,440
Where are we?

11680
06:55:28,020 --> 06:55:29,540
We're in the thick of it.

11681
06:55:31,220 --> 06:55:33,100
We're in the thick of it.

11682
06:55:33,720 --> 06:55:35,580
The music is gone.

11683
06:55:35,660 --> 06:55:36,740
Just like my sanity.

11684
06:55:36,740 --> 06:55:38,560
Why is your music disappearing?

11685
06:55:39,320 --> 06:55:40,740
It's like a YouTube playlist.

11686
06:55:41,120 --> 06:55:43,220
Oh, did you put on like Minecraft music or something?

11687
06:55:43,640 --> 06:55:45,220
No, it's like the thing where like...

11688
06:55:45,220 --> 06:55:46,300
If you leave it on...

11689
06:55:46,300 --> 06:55:49,160
If you leave your playlist on unintended, it like pauses it.

11690
06:55:49,200 --> 06:55:50,280
Because they're like, are you alive?

11691
06:55:50,400 --> 06:55:52,040
Oh, it does the Netflix thing?

11692
06:55:52,940 --> 06:55:53,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11693
06:55:54,020 --> 06:55:54,640
It does that.

11694
06:55:55,960 --> 06:55:57,120
I don't know where I should...

11695
06:55:57,120 --> 06:55:59,020
I'm running out of blocks.

11696
06:55:59,840 --> 06:56:01,060
It's so shiny.

11697
06:56:01,300 --> 06:56:02,800
I just want to jump into it.

11698
06:56:03,080 --> 06:56:04,720
It would be so funny though.

11699
06:56:04,720 --> 06:56:06,300
I'm gonna do it.

11700
06:56:07,000 --> 06:56:08,020
I'm gonna...

11701
06:56:08,020 --> 06:56:10,140
You could continue on without me.

11702
06:56:10,580 --> 06:56:11,680
I'm gonna do it.

11703
06:56:12,660 --> 06:56:13,680
No, you're not.

11704
06:56:13,900 --> 06:56:14,720
I'm gonna do it.

11705
06:56:15,020 --> 06:56:17,500
Wait, why are you going that way?

11706
06:56:17,780 --> 06:56:19,160
I'm gonna do it.

11707
06:56:21,060 --> 06:56:21,780
I'm gonna...

11708
06:56:21,780 --> 06:56:22,600
Do you believe?

11709
06:56:23,640 --> 06:56:25,260
Do you believe?

11710
06:56:25,520 --> 06:56:26,620
I can't see your POV.

11711
06:56:26,700 --> 06:56:27,700
I don't believe, honestly.

11712
06:56:27,780 --> 06:56:28,620
I don't know your POV.

11713
06:56:30,040 --> 06:56:31,300
Don't take it!

11714
06:56:31,300 --> 06:56:31,320
Don't take it!

11715
06:56:33,340 --> 06:56:34,580
Here we go.

11716
06:56:34,980 --> 06:56:35,780
Oh, you made it.

11717
06:56:36,040 --> 06:56:38,260
I thought you said you didn't see me.

11718
06:56:38,720 --> 06:56:39,340
No, I see you.

11719
06:56:39,400 --> 06:56:41,460
I don't see where you... I didn't see where you were gonna land.

11720
06:56:41,560 --> 06:56:42,600
It looked like...

11721
06:56:42,600 --> 06:56:44,440
It looked like you were gonna land into a lava.

11722
06:56:45,240 --> 06:56:46,220
Oh, yeah.

11723
06:56:46,440 --> 06:56:47,280
No, there was...

11724
06:56:47,280 --> 06:56:48,840
There was a chance.

11725
06:56:50,240 --> 06:56:51,600
Wait, okay, let's split up, gang.

11726
06:56:51,940 --> 06:56:53,360
We've already split up.

11727
06:56:53,460 --> 06:56:54,340
Let's split up.

11728
06:56:54,700 --> 06:56:56,200
No, that's the worst idea.

11729
06:56:56,620 --> 06:56:57,960
One of us will die.

11730
06:56:57,960 --> 06:56:59,940
Okay, then we'll...

11731
06:56:59,940 --> 06:57:00,760
Blame the other.

11732
06:57:01,240 --> 06:57:02,660
We'll do this all over again.

11733
06:57:03,120 --> 06:57:05,840
We're gonna do this all over again.

11734
06:57:06,000 --> 06:57:06,780
How much...

11735
06:57:08,100 --> 06:57:09,320
Probability is me.

11736
06:57:09,760 --> 06:57:10,740
If we...

11737
06:57:10,740 --> 06:57:16,140
Okay, how much do you think we would owe chat if we told them that we didn't want to do this anymore?

11738
06:57:16,720 --> 06:57:18,780
No, we have to, Mint!

11739
06:57:18,840 --> 06:57:20,740
We can't just give up!

11740
06:57:21,860 --> 06:57:24,020
We're not quitters!

11741
06:57:25,180 --> 06:57:25,740
Mint.

11742
06:57:25,740 --> 06:57:26,280
Mint.

11743
06:57:27,160 --> 06:57:28,420
You got this.

11744
06:57:28,540 --> 06:57:29,000
You knew!

11745
06:57:29,140 --> 06:57:30,740
You knew the time commitment!

11746
06:57:32,300 --> 06:57:32,980
Okay, where are you?

11747
06:57:33,040 --> 06:57:33,960
I'm coming back to you.

11748
06:57:36,240 --> 06:57:37,040
I'm in the air.

11749
06:57:37,300 --> 06:57:39,200
You probably could see my little bridge.

11750
06:57:39,660 --> 06:57:40,440
My sky bridge.

11751
06:57:40,740 --> 06:57:43,800
My god, you made a fucking sky bridge.

11752
06:57:44,380 --> 06:57:46,140
Mint, it's time to get the gamer soaps out.

11753
06:57:46,380 --> 06:57:46,880
It's time.

11754
06:57:47,780 --> 06:57:48,600
It's time.

11755
06:57:48,620 --> 06:57:50,140
It's time to get the gamer soaps out.

11756
06:57:50,360 --> 06:57:50,780
Are you actually?

11757
06:57:51,220 --> 06:57:54,280
I will drink the gamer soaps if you drink the gamer soaps.

11758
06:57:54,280 --> 06:57:55,960
I have so much gamer soaps.

11759
06:57:56,040 --> 06:57:59,120
I think I will actually have gamer soaps for like 5 years.

11760
06:57:59,960 --> 06:58:01,520
Exactly, it's time.

11761
06:58:02,520 --> 06:58:03,840
Are you gonna go get some?

11762
06:58:04,420 --> 06:58:06,200
I'll get some when we meet up.

11763
06:58:06,420 --> 06:58:07,660
When we...

11764
06:58:07,660 --> 06:58:08,940
Okay, well come to me then.

11765
06:58:09,060 --> 06:58:09,580
Where are you?

11766
06:58:10,300 --> 06:58:11,620
I'm in the thick of it.

11767
06:58:12,020 --> 06:58:12,940
Then come to...

11768
06:58:12,940 --> 06:58:16,380
I told you to stay along the edge so we could see if we see any...

11769
06:58:17,220 --> 06:58:18,340
I don't know.

11770
06:58:18,880 --> 06:58:21,420
You know I don't know anymore.

11771
06:58:23,580 --> 06:58:24,540
I'm just...

11772
06:58:26,020 --> 06:58:28,160
I'm trying to not die.

11773
06:58:28,540 --> 06:58:29,900
I see you.

11774
06:58:30,220 --> 06:58:30,640
You do?

11775
06:58:31,720 --> 06:58:33,900
Okay, I'm gonna go get something to drink actually.

11776
06:58:33,980 --> 06:58:34,860
Because I'm dehydrated.

11777
06:58:35,620 --> 06:58:35,900
Okay.

11778
06:58:36,680 --> 06:58:38,520
I'll make gamer soaps later.

11779
06:58:39,420 --> 06:58:40,540
No, no, make it.

11780
06:58:41,320 --> 06:58:42,480
We can take a break.

11781
06:58:43,200 --> 06:58:44,200
No, no, no.

11782
06:58:44,280 --> 06:58:45,320
I'm in the thick of it.

11783
06:58:45,440 --> 06:58:46,520
I'm panning over to you.

11784
06:58:46,680 --> 06:58:48,000
Wait, what's your name?

11785
06:58:48,000 --> 06:58:49,760
I'm in a fortress.

11786
06:58:50,100 --> 06:58:51,160
Not a real one.

11787
06:58:51,540 --> 06:58:53,720
I said the wrong one.

11788
06:58:54,400 --> 06:58:55,280
Don't say that.

11789
06:58:55,620 --> 06:58:58,040
You gave me hope for a second.

11790
06:58:58,780 --> 06:59:00,080
You gave me...

11791
06:59:00,080 --> 06:59:01,620
You gave me hope for...

11792
06:59:01,620 --> 06:59:04,400
Okay, while I...

11793
06:59:04,400 --> 06:59:06,040
You go make your drink.

11794
06:59:06,240 --> 06:59:07,900
And then after you make your drink...

11795
06:59:07,900 --> 06:59:08,480
You come back.

11796
06:59:08,500 --> 06:59:10,680
I entertain chat while you make drink.

11797
06:59:10,880 --> 06:59:11,080
Okay.

11798
06:59:11,160 --> 06:59:12,940
And then after you make drink, you come back.

11799
06:59:13,040 --> 06:59:14,560
And then I need to...

11800
06:59:15,700 --> 06:59:19,240
And then I need to walk my dog.

11801
06:59:19,420 --> 06:59:20,480
And then...

11802
06:59:20,480 --> 06:59:22,240
And then we go on.

11803
06:59:22,320 --> 06:59:24,720
Wait, how long is a dog walk?

11804
06:59:25,040 --> 06:59:26,960
It's like 10 minutes.

11805
06:59:27,180 --> 06:59:28,680
He just needs to pee and poop.

11806
06:59:28,840 --> 06:59:30,780
He just needs to pee and poop.

11807
06:59:31,200 --> 06:59:31,800
Oh my God.

11808
06:59:31,900 --> 06:59:33,260
You never had a dog before?

11809
06:59:33,420 --> 06:59:34,630
I have, but like...

11810
06:59:35,340 --> 06:59:36,620
I just would...

11811
06:59:36,620 --> 06:59:38,160
My mom took care of him.

11812
06:59:39,020 --> 06:59:40,600
Oh, you're not responsible.

11813
06:59:41,280 --> 06:59:42,710
We would just let her out and...

11814
06:59:42,710 --> 06:59:44,670
And they'd run around.

11815
06:59:44,950 --> 06:59:45,430
Okay.

11816
06:59:46,490 --> 06:59:47,910
Go make your tea.

11817
06:59:48,010 --> 06:59:48,970
Gotta pee and poop.

11818
06:59:49,530 --> 06:59:50,410
Okay, I'm going.

11819
06:59:51,050 --> 06:59:51,530
Okay,

11820
06:59:55,570 --> 06:59:55,570
guys.

11821
06:59:56,050 --> 06:59:58,350
Guys, how...

11822
06:59:58,350 --> 06:59:59,350
Oh my God, please.

11823
06:59:59,730 --> 07:00:00,770
Please stop.

11824
07:00:01,010 --> 07:00:02,570
Get away from...

11825
07:00:02,570 --> 07:00:03,550
Oh, he's gonna hit him.

11826
07:00:03,670 --> 07:00:04,410
He's gonna kill him.

11827
07:00:04,550 --> 07:00:05,150
Oh, thank God.

11828
07:00:05,270 --> 07:00:06,750
Please kill that stupid pig.

11829
07:00:06,870 --> 07:00:08,210
He stopped killing him.

11830
07:00:08,410 --> 07:00:09,630
Why did you stop?

11831
07:00:12,710 --> 07:00:13,550
Wait, I lost her.

11832
07:00:13,630 --> 07:00:14,370
Oh, there she is.

11833
07:00:14,430 --> 07:00:14,710
Okay.

11834
07:00:15,590 --> 07:00:19,050
Alright, I gotta grab more of these.

11835
07:00:19,350 --> 07:00:20,710
And then grab my...

11836
07:00:21,970 --> 07:00:23,270
Where's the piggies?

11837
07:00:23,650 --> 07:00:24,810
Wait, is that...

11838
07:00:24,810 --> 07:00:26,490
Is that the...

11839
07:00:26,490 --> 07:00:28,250
Oh no, that's the gas.

11840
07:00:28,790 --> 07:00:29,390
When...

11841
07:00:29,390 --> 07:00:32,530
When will I find a fortress?

11842
07:00:37,650 --> 07:00:39,770
I'm gonna make my own house.

11843
07:00:40,110 --> 07:00:41,370
I'm gonna make...

11844
07:00:41,370 --> 07:00:43,050
my own little house.

11845
07:00:47,850 --> 07:00:49,970
I gotta make my house.

11846
07:00:50,550 --> 07:00:51,510
Gotta...

11847
07:00:51,510 --> 07:00:51,890
No!

11848
07:00:52,590 --> 07:00:55,050
No, I'm not a cheater!

11849
07:00:57,810 --> 07:00:59,930
Alright, I got my safe house.

11850
07:01:00,410 --> 07:01:02,470
Never give up.

11851
07:01:03,470 --> 07:01:05,470
Never back down.

11852
07:01:06,430 --> 07:01:08,630
I'm sorry, Dad.

11853
07:01:09,210 --> 07:01:10,430
I'm sorry.

11854
07:01:10,630 --> 07:01:13,230
I know you wanna pee and poop.

11855
07:01:13,410 --> 07:01:14,370
I'm sorry.

11856
07:01:14,370 --> 07:01:14,470
I'm sorry.

11857
07:01:15,030 --> 07:01:16,750
Give me a sec.

11858
07:01:16,830 --> 07:01:18,730
I can walk you soon.

11859
07:01:19,030 --> 07:01:20,890
I can walk you soon.

11860
07:01:23,210 --> 07:01:26,890
Are fortresses normally this hard?

11861
07:01:28,530 --> 07:01:31,670
Are they normally this hard to find?

11862
07:01:31,910 --> 07:01:33,230
I don't understand.

11863
07:01:33,830 --> 07:01:35,350
I don't understand.

11864
07:01:36,690 --> 07:01:39,690
Are they normally this difficult?

11865
07:01:39,690 --> 07:01:39,830
Are they normally this difficult?

11866
07:01:42,430 --> 07:01:43,450
No!

11867
07:01:44,650 --> 07:01:45,670
No!

11868
07:01:46,070 --> 07:01:47,410
What's wrong with us?

11869
07:01:47,870 --> 07:01:50,310
What's wrong with us?

11870
07:01:56,810 --> 07:01:59,250
I don't know.

11871
07:02:02,850 --> 07:02:04,430
I don't know.

11872
07:02:05,050 --> 07:02:06,590
I don't...

11873
07:02:06,590 --> 07:02:10,210
I don't know why we can't...

11874
07:02:10,210 --> 07:02:11,090
We can't do...

11875
07:02:11,090 --> 07:02:13,070
We can't find a single fortress.

11876
07:02:13,370 --> 07:02:14,930
It's like the frog's all over again.

11877
07:02:15,430 --> 07:02:17,970
It's like the frog's all over again.

11878
07:02:22,340 --> 07:02:24,440
Look in open areas.

11879
07:02:26,180 --> 07:02:26,940
Okay.

11880
07:02:28,620 --> 07:02:30,860
There's so many people fighting.

11881
07:02:33,780 --> 07:02:34,160
Okay.

11882
07:02:34,660 --> 07:02:35,060
Alright.

11883
07:02:37,700 --> 07:02:38,460
Okay.

11884
07:02:38,460 --> 07:02:38,600
Okay.

11885
07:02:40,400 --> 07:02:41,300
Oh, we're going...

11886
07:02:41,300 --> 07:02:43,180
Okay, we just gotta go in the open area.

11887
07:02:43,420 --> 07:02:44,580
We just...

11888
07:02:45,860 --> 07:02:48,000
We just need to go...

11889
07:02:48,000 --> 07:02:48,800
Okay, alright.

11890
07:02:48,940 --> 07:02:50,560
Now it's your turn to talk to the chat.

11891
07:02:50,780 --> 07:02:52,680
I'm gonna go walk him.

11892
07:02:53,040 --> 07:02:54,300
And then make my gamer subs.

11893
07:02:54,380 --> 07:02:55,140
I'll be right back.

11894
07:02:55,240 --> 07:02:55,500
Alright.

11895
07:02:55,660 --> 07:02:56,500
Oh my god!

11896
07:02:56,580 --> 07:02:58,640
A guy spawned on my...

11897
07:02:58,640 --> 07:03:01,280
My bridge!

11898
07:03:01,280 --> 07:03:02,040
My sky bridge!

11899
07:03:02,140 --> 07:03:03,960
I got some more mac and cheese, guys.

11900
07:03:09,720 --> 07:03:10,180
I'm...

11901
07:03:10,180 --> 07:03:13,360
I've come to the...

11902
07:03:13,360 --> 07:03:14,560
What's the word?

11903
07:03:15,160 --> 07:03:16,120
Not the realization.

11904
07:03:16,900 --> 07:03:19,400
I've come with peace that this might ruin my sleep schedule.

11905
07:03:22,460 --> 07:03:25,220
I want to stream tomorrow, but...

11906
07:03:25,220 --> 07:03:26,340
It might be more Minecraft.

11907
07:03:31,280 --> 07:03:32,340
Give us the seed.

11908
07:03:32,480 --> 07:03:32,720
No!

11909
07:03:33,700 --> 07:03:34,260
No!

11910
07:03:36,780 --> 07:03:39,360
I refuse to give you the seed!

11911
07:03:42,380 --> 07:03:43,660
I refuse.

11912
07:03:46,400 --> 07:03:50,280
When Doki proposed this, I thought we were gonna start in like the morning.

11913
07:03:51,800 --> 07:03:53,260
What was he thinking?

11914
07:03:57,380 --> 07:03:59,780
Doki, I wake up at 10am every morning!

11915
07:04:04,340 --> 07:04:07,520
My sleep schedule is not broken like yours!

11916
07:04:11,120 --> 07:04:12,700
She had too much confidence.

11917
07:04:12,880 --> 07:04:13,900
Yeah, I think so.

11918
07:04:28,280 --> 07:04:29,510
I'm just eating my dinner.

11919
07:04:32,210 --> 07:04:33,710
Where even is she?

11920
07:04:34,570 --> 07:04:36,190
Like, where did she...

11921
07:04:36,190 --> 07:04:38,620
Look at this guy taking over my bridge.

11922
07:04:42,530 --> 07:04:43,830
I don't mind a second stream.

11923
07:04:46,370 --> 07:04:48,830
If it comes down to it, we have to.

11924
07:04:51,910 --> 07:04:53,370
She's in the ground.

11925
07:04:54,030 --> 07:04:55,490
What is this hobbit...

11926
07:04:55,490 --> 07:04:56,450
What is she doing?

11927
07:04:57,710 --> 07:04:59,370
She's a groundhog now?

11928
07:05:03,110 --> 07:05:04,350
I'm gonna keep going.

11929
07:05:06,190 --> 07:05:07,550
I'm gonna keep going.

11930
07:05:09,850 --> 07:05:11,690
But I need more...

11931
07:05:14,090 --> 07:05:15,350
I'm gonna waste all my deep slate.

11932
07:05:17,390 --> 07:05:18,530
For these, you know?

11933
07:05:18,970 --> 07:05:20,470
These are good against like...

11934
07:05:20,470 --> 07:05:22,850
I can get more, I guess.

11935
07:05:26,830 --> 07:05:28,110
She's six feet under.

11936
07:05:30,030 --> 07:05:31,150
I wish that were me.

11937
07:05:31,590 --> 07:05:33,010
Actually, can she and I trade places?

11938
07:05:34,810 --> 07:05:36,250
Can she and I trade places?

11939
07:05:37,170 --> 07:05:38,210
I guess I can drop here.

11940
07:05:40,370 --> 07:05:42,250
Did she go further than me?

11941
07:05:42,250 --> 07:05:42,930
I don't know.

11942
07:05:43,510 --> 07:05:43,950
Oh wait!

11943
07:05:44,370 --> 07:05:45,350
Oh my gosh, there she is!

11944
07:05:48,390 --> 07:05:49,510
Doki Birdo.

11945
07:05:51,190 --> 07:05:52,350
I found her.

11946
07:05:52,810 --> 07:05:53,590
That's so funny.

11947
07:05:57,750 --> 07:05:58,930
Oh my gosh.

11948
07:06:01,290 --> 07:06:01,850
More...

11949
07:06:01,850 --> 07:06:03,690
Okay, blue forest is fine.

11950
07:06:04,910 --> 07:06:06,430
We don't mind the blue forest.

11951
07:06:07,630 --> 07:06:09,510
Here, I'll even make the bridge over there.

11952
07:06:09,990 --> 07:06:10,830
That'll be productive.

11953
07:06:11,930 --> 07:06:13,430
While we wait.

11954
07:06:13,590 --> 07:06:14,290
Oh my god.

11955
07:06:15,010 --> 07:06:16,110
I'll be productive, everybody.

11956
07:06:16,650 --> 07:06:18,150
Doki stream, you may not be able to see.

11957
07:06:19,990 --> 07:06:21,010
But trust.

11958
07:06:21,750 --> 07:06:22,550
Trust in me.

11959
07:06:23,110 --> 07:06:24,370
That I'm making a bridge.

11960
07:06:24,850 --> 07:06:25,950
Across the sea.

11961
07:06:29,870 --> 07:06:30,470
I'm...

11962
07:06:30,470 --> 07:06:31,810
Almost there.

11963
07:06:33,990 --> 07:06:36,630
We'll find the fortress and we'll live.

11964
07:06:36,750 --> 07:06:37,490
We'll survive.

11965
07:06:37,490 --> 07:06:39,770
If it's the two of us, we can do it.

11966
07:06:40,450 --> 07:06:41,930
If it's the two of us.

11967
07:06:44,350 --> 07:06:48,070
If it's the two of us, we have to be able to.

11968
07:06:56,230 --> 07:06:57,390
Oh my god, no.

11969
07:06:57,810 --> 07:06:58,170
Ghast.

11970
07:06:59,250 --> 07:07:00,950
I swear, go away.

11971
07:07:01,370 --> 07:07:03,230
Oh my god, I hear him.

11972
07:07:03,270 --> 07:07:04,550
He's like right next to me.

11973
07:07:05,590 --> 07:07:06,070
No.

11974
07:07:06,070 --> 07:07:06,170
No.

11975
07:07:07,010 --> 07:07:08,270
Oh my gosh.

11976
07:07:09,650 --> 07:07:10,210
Believe.

11977
07:07:11,810 --> 07:07:13,570
Believe in magic.

11978
07:07:15,290 --> 07:07:15,850
Guys.

11979
07:07:16,130 --> 07:07:17,690
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

11980
07:07:17,990 --> 07:07:19,230
I'm just gonna say it.

11981
07:07:19,450 --> 07:07:21,730
We've gone through every biome but the basalt.

11982
07:07:22,090 --> 07:07:24,110
We have to go through the basalt.

11983
07:07:24,670 --> 07:07:26,070
We've gone through every...

11984
07:07:26,650 --> 07:07:27,470
Oh my god.

11985
07:07:27,590 --> 07:07:28,490
I thought that was a...

11986
07:07:28,490 --> 07:07:30,770
I thought that was a fortress.

11987
07:07:31,510 --> 07:07:32,630
Oh my god.

11988
07:07:32,630 --> 07:07:34,630
I literally...

11989
07:07:35,210 --> 07:07:38,010
This I thought was the top of...

11990
07:07:38,010 --> 07:07:39,170
Oh my god.

11991
07:07:39,230 --> 07:07:40,670
I thought we had made it.

11992
07:07:43,590 --> 07:07:46,410
I made it myself so much.

11993
07:07:47,550 --> 07:07:50,690
We've gone through every biome but the basalt.

11994
07:07:51,390 --> 07:07:51,750
We...

11995
07:07:51,750 --> 07:07:53,630
This is what we have to do.

11996
07:07:59,170 --> 07:08:01,050
See, check that out.

11997
07:08:04,360 --> 07:08:05,160
Come here.

11998
07:08:05,480 --> 07:08:06,840
Give me magma cubes.

11999
07:08:07,340 --> 07:08:09,860
Why do they hurt so much?

12000
07:08:11,980 --> 07:08:13,240
Give me magma cubes.

12001
07:08:14,000 --> 07:08:15,000
Did they not give me anything?

12002
07:08:15,940 --> 07:08:18,480
Oh my gosh, everything is so stingy in this game.

12003
07:08:19,320 --> 07:08:20,800
No nether fortress November?

12004
07:08:34,480 --> 07:08:35,440
Yeah, maybe.

12005
07:08:37,600 --> 07:08:40,540
If we never find one, just what do we do?

12006
07:08:44,400 --> 07:08:46,340
I think we should give ourselves a time limit.

12007
07:08:50,740 --> 07:08:52,480
And if we don't find it within the time...

12008
07:08:56,270 --> 07:08:58,670
I told you it was in the basalt!

12009
07:09:13,130 --> 07:09:14,050
Don't give up!

12010
07:09:25,090 --> 07:09:29,670
I literally was gonna say if we don't find one in the next 30 minutes we do a new seed.

12011
07:09:30,010 --> 07:09:34,270
But then I literally just saw it right there!

12012
07:09:40,710 --> 07:09:42,470
Sorry, I need to drink so much more water.

12013
07:09:47,010 --> 07:09:48,350
I sent that before...

12014
07:09:48,350 --> 07:09:52,570
Oh, the funny and sad thing was that you two were making really good progress but the nether said no.

12015
07:09:54,210 --> 07:09:55,690
Oh, and then you sent that before.

12016
07:09:56,350 --> 07:09:57,050
That's so silly.

12017
07:09:57,170 --> 07:10:03,050
I know how to get to here so I didn't really need to save the cords but I guess it's good to have it too.

12018
07:10:03,230 --> 07:10:03,430
Alright.

12019
07:10:05,190 --> 07:10:06,290
Oh my god.

12020
07:10:07,830 --> 07:10:09,490
Oh my god.

12021
07:10:10,750 --> 07:10:12,130
Oh my god.

12022
07:10:13,250 --> 07:10:14,850
It was right here!

12023
07:10:14,970 --> 07:10:15,890
Oh my gosh.

12024
07:10:17,450 --> 07:10:19,690
See, she just has to cross from here.

12025
07:10:21,550 --> 07:10:22,730
She just crosses.

12026
07:10:23,230 --> 07:10:26,530
She's right up there, she crosses and then we just run right into it.

12027
07:10:26,690 --> 07:10:27,550
Oh my god.

12028
07:10:29,090 --> 07:10:30,990
What if I don't tell her that I found one?

12029
07:10:34,390 --> 07:10:36,810
What if I just didn't tell her that I found it?

12030
07:10:37,410 --> 07:10:38,130
I'm just kidding.

12031
07:10:43,330 --> 07:10:44,770
Dragoons, I'm gonna tell her, don't worry.

12032
07:10:45,030 --> 07:10:46,150
We've been through enough.

12033
07:10:46,630 --> 07:10:48,450
We've been through enough, I'm gonna tell her, don't worry.

12034
07:10:51,170 --> 07:10:52,810
Loot it and then don't tell her?

12035
07:10:54,730 --> 07:10:56,350
I'm not going in there by myself.

12036
07:10:56,430 --> 07:10:58,470
I hate fortresses.

12037
07:11:01,490 --> 07:11:04,450
I'm gonna make a little hideaway for me.

12038
07:11:07,550 --> 07:11:09,690
Don't go into the bath salt, they said.

12039
07:11:11,070 --> 07:11:11,950
Oh my...

12040
07:11:11,950 --> 07:11:15,450
Doki's chat, all the dragoons said don't go into the bath salt.

12041
07:11:16,070 --> 07:11:17,790
You didn't have to prove me wrong that fast.

12042
07:11:18,010 --> 07:11:19,090
What did you do?

12043
07:11:19,210 --> 07:11:19,850
What did you say?

12044
07:11:22,290 --> 07:11:25,750
Thank you guys for all the donos and memberships and gifted and everything.

12045
07:11:26,590 --> 07:11:28,850
Really appreciate it, both of us.

12046
07:11:29,070 --> 07:11:31,610
Sorry we can't really acknowledge all of them on stream.

12047
07:11:33,350 --> 07:11:36,050
While we're losing our brain cells.

12048
07:11:37,510 --> 07:11:41,010
But we are seeing As a dragoon, please don't tell her.

12049
07:11:44,650 --> 07:11:46,470
That other guy would just snitch.

12050
07:11:47,290 --> 07:11:48,330
Yeah, he would.

12051
07:11:49,910 --> 07:11:51,250
Eragon, where are you?

12052
07:11:52,110 --> 07:11:53,410
Eragon the snitcher.

12053
07:11:53,550 --> 07:11:54,690
You gotta change your name, man.

12054
07:12:02,030 --> 07:12:04,370
Say you found it, but like Doki guess.

12055
07:12:06,110 --> 07:12:08,350
This guy is really trying hard to get those.

12056
07:12:10,030 --> 07:12:11,090
I wanna get these.

12057
07:12:11,130 --> 07:12:11,950
This is perfect too.

12058
07:12:12,070 --> 07:12:13,450
We can get lots of magma cubes.

12059
07:12:13,670 --> 07:12:15,750
Actually, I feel like this is a good...

12060
07:12:16,430 --> 07:12:19,490
Magma cubes are annoying, but they're not so bad, you know?

12061
07:12:19,570 --> 07:12:21,650
This is a good biome for it to spawn in.

12062
07:12:22,790 --> 07:12:24,150
Why'd I say all of this?

12063
07:12:25,950 --> 07:12:29,010
It's like a broken fortress and we don't get any blazes.

12064
07:12:34,010 --> 07:12:36,870
I think Doki stole one O from your name.

12065
07:12:38,030 --> 07:12:38,870
Oh, the bird O?

12066
07:12:39,050 --> 07:12:39,730
Doki bird O?

12067
07:12:42,350 --> 07:12:46,150
Yeah, she saw how popular Minto is and she's like, oh yeah, I'll be Doki bird O.

12068
07:12:46,210 --> 07:12:47,750
Or she's trying to be bird O from...

12069
07:12:50,750 --> 07:12:51,150
From...

12070
07:12:51,690 --> 07:12:53,730
Mario, but who would wanna be that loser?

12071
07:12:57,630 --> 07:12:58,550
Don't jinx it.

12072
07:12:58,630 --> 07:12:59,510
I don't know, guys.

12073
07:13:00,630 --> 07:13:01,330
I'm feeling...

12074
07:13:01,330 --> 07:13:01,730
I don't know.

12075
07:13:02,010 --> 07:13:04,370
I'm gonna hide in this cubby hole while I eat.

12076
07:13:05,770 --> 07:13:07,330
I always believed in you, especially you.

12077
07:13:09,630 --> 07:13:10,430
Thanks, Aizy.

12078
07:13:13,390 --> 07:13:13,990
Oh.

12079
07:13:18,700 --> 07:13:20,720
Bird O is so scary looking.

12080
07:13:24,160 --> 07:13:26,420
And I like kimo kawaii things.

12081
07:13:27,160 --> 07:13:29,540
I keep seeing these things called labubus.

12082
07:13:29,640 --> 07:13:30,580
Have you guys ever heard of it?

12083
07:13:33,280 --> 07:13:35,040
You know how like...

12084
07:13:35,500 --> 07:13:36,780
These like...

12085
07:13:36,780 --> 07:13:41,560
These blind boxes of like these random characters have gotten really popular?

12086
07:13:43,440 --> 07:13:45,000
You've never seen a labubu?

12087
07:13:45,000 --> 07:13:49,600
I don't know how to spell it, but I keep just seeing people being like, who would wanna buy a labubu?

12088
07:13:49,900 --> 07:13:50,940
Why are they so popular?

12089
07:13:51,060 --> 07:13:51,960
They're so ugly.

12090
07:13:52,380 --> 07:13:53,000
But they're kinda...

12091
07:13:53,000 --> 07:13:53,560
I like them.

12092
07:13:53,620 --> 07:13:54,280
I think they're cute.

12093
07:13:54,380 --> 07:13:55,840
They look like little gremlins.

12094
07:13:58,220 --> 07:13:59,700
Labubu craze even in the west?

12095
07:13:59,800 --> 07:14:02,640
I think less so, but it's still popular.

12096
07:14:06,140 --> 07:14:09,920
People will line up at stores at like 5am for new labubus.

12097
07:14:11,280 --> 07:14:12,720
I don't understand it.

12098
07:14:13,980 --> 07:14:16,060
Got popular thanks to Lisa.

12099
07:14:17,860 --> 07:14:18,620
Like...

12100
07:14:18,620 --> 07:14:20,160
Blackpink Lisa?

12101
07:14:20,260 --> 07:14:21,060
Is she Blackpink?

12102
07:14:24,540 --> 07:14:25,380
They're cute though.

12103
07:14:25,420 --> 07:14:26,200
I like them.

12104
07:14:30,420 --> 07:14:31,180
Labubu.

12105
07:14:31,580 --> 07:14:32,840
It's fun to say.

12106
07:14:33,480 --> 07:14:34,120
Labubu.

12107
07:14:36,840 --> 07:14:38,600
Oh yeah, Lisa Blackpink.

12108
07:14:38,840 --> 07:14:39,220
Okay.

12109
07:14:40,060 --> 07:14:40,400
Yeah.

12110
07:14:40,400 --> 07:14:42,080
And like...

12111
07:14:42,080 --> 07:14:42,640
I don't know.

12112
07:14:42,740 --> 07:14:46,060
Recently, like the weirdest things are popping off.

12113
07:14:46,280 --> 07:14:53,240
Where people will like... Okay, have you guys heard about the ladies that like stalk TJ Maxx for Hello Kitty goods?

12114
07:14:54,120 --> 07:15:01,540
If you don't live in the US, there's a store called TJ Maxx that like sells kind of discounted items and stuff.

12115
07:15:01,660 --> 07:15:02,580
It's like...

12116
07:15:02,580 --> 07:15:04,200
It's like...

12117
07:15:04,200 --> 07:15:14,980
Not... It's not Walmart, but it's like sometimes you can find designer brands in there that are a little like less expensive and stuff.

12118
07:15:16,140 --> 07:15:24,840
And so... But recently Hello Kitty blankets and like mugs and things have become like the it item.

12119
07:15:25,000 --> 07:15:26,440
And so...

12120
07:15:26,440 --> 07:15:32,200
These ladies are going to TJ Maxx and like scalping these Hello Kitty products.

12121
07:15:32,460 --> 07:15:33,520
They're not even that cute.

12122
07:15:33,580 --> 07:15:34,400
I don't understand.

12123
07:15:38,380 --> 07:15:39,440
It's like a discount store.

12124
07:15:40,260 --> 07:15:42,560
Yeah, it's like...

12125
07:15:42,560 --> 07:15:44,720
I don't know how to describe it, honestly.

12126
07:15:45,440 --> 07:15:47,460
It's like if Target was a thrift store.

12127
07:15:48,320 --> 07:15:49,760
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

12128
07:15:51,800 --> 07:16:02,280
But they'll go to TJ Maxx like in the early mornings and like fill their carts with all the restocked Hello Kitty goods and then...

12129
07:16:02,280 --> 07:16:04,380
And then...

12130
07:16:04,900 --> 07:16:06,320
Oh, hello.

12131
07:16:06,320 --> 07:16:06,900
I'm back.

12132
07:16:07,040 --> 07:16:07,660
Welcome back.

12133
07:16:07,980 --> 07:16:08,840
I'm back.

12134
07:16:09,900 --> 07:16:12,400
So did you get...

12135
07:16:12,400 --> 07:16:13,160
Did you...

12136
07:16:13,880 --> 07:16:16,060
Did you get any intel?

12137
07:16:17,000 --> 07:16:17,440
Yeah.

12138
07:16:17,740 --> 07:16:19,240
Did you cheat?

12139
07:16:19,540 --> 07:16:19,820
No.

12140
07:16:20,040 --> 07:16:20,780
No, I didn't cheat.

12141
07:16:21,180 --> 07:16:21,880
Did you cheat?

12142
07:16:22,120 --> 07:16:22,840
No, no, no.

12143
07:16:24,360 --> 07:16:24,680
Doki.

12144
07:16:24,880 --> 07:16:25,160
Did you cheat?

12145
07:16:25,600 --> 07:16:26,300
No, I didn't.

12146
07:16:26,480 --> 07:16:26,740
Doki.

12147
07:16:29,060 --> 07:16:30,220
There's a guy...

12148
07:16:30,220 --> 07:16:32,300
There's a... Oh, he's getting beat up.

12149
07:16:32,480 --> 07:16:32,760
Doki?

12150
07:16:33,740 --> 07:16:34,120
Yeah?

12151
07:16:34,120 --> 07:16:35,740
I found it.

12152
07:16:37,080 --> 07:16:37,680
You...

12153
07:16:42,050 --> 07:16:43,230
I found one.

12154
07:16:47,720 --> 07:16:48,900
I built a bridge.

12155
07:16:48,980 --> 07:16:49,540
Come over here.

12156
07:16:51,260 --> 07:16:51,860
Hello?

12157
07:16:52,160 --> 07:16:53,160
Why did you leave?

12158
07:16:55,020 --> 07:16:55,620
Hello?

12159
07:16:56,540 --> 07:16:56,740
Oh.

12160
07:16:58,100 --> 07:16:58,340
What?

12161
07:16:59,700 --> 07:17:00,600
Come here!

12162
07:17:01,700 --> 07:17:02,940
Get out of your hole.

12163
07:17:03,080 --> 07:17:03,940
I saw your hole.

12164
07:17:06,500 --> 07:17:07,640
I built a bridge.

12165
07:17:07,640 --> 07:17:08,220
Why is our chat...

12166
07:17:09,960 --> 07:17:12,780
Why is our chat saying many different things?

12167
07:17:13,920 --> 07:17:14,120
What?

12168
07:17:15,220 --> 07:17:16,980
Because they're not watching me.

12169
07:17:17,080 --> 07:17:18,740
They didn't see me discover it.

12170
07:17:23,400 --> 07:17:23,680
What?

12171
07:17:24,320 --> 07:17:24,880
Dragoons!

12172
07:17:25,300 --> 07:17:26,960
Dragoons, why are you being like this?

12173
07:17:32,460 --> 07:17:33,980
Dragoons said you were cheating.

12174
07:17:34,360 --> 07:17:34,920
What?

12175
07:17:34,920 --> 07:17:35,580
Oh my god.

12176
07:17:35,740 --> 07:17:37,460
No, literally when I came back...

12177
07:17:37,460 --> 07:17:39,620
The first super chat I saw was someone being like...

12178
07:17:39,620 --> 07:17:40,620
Give me the seed.

12179
07:17:40,920 --> 07:17:41,620
And I was like, no!

12180
07:17:42,700 --> 07:17:43,820
Here, come over this way.

12181
07:17:44,620 --> 07:17:46,240
You can't even find the seed.

12182
07:17:46,820 --> 07:17:48,840
Yeah, I don't even have the commands probably.

12183
07:17:49,540 --> 07:17:50,220
Did you see me?

12184
07:17:50,800 --> 07:17:52,780
Yes, there's a pig in front of me!

12185
07:17:53,100 --> 07:17:54,020
Put down a mushroom!

12186
07:17:54,700 --> 07:17:55,740
I only have one!

12187
07:17:56,180 --> 07:17:57,180
That's all you need!

12188
07:17:57,240 --> 07:17:57,760
Come on!

12189
07:17:58,280 --> 07:17:59,740
But what if he hits me?

12190
07:18:00,060 --> 07:18:00,680
Put it down!

12191
07:18:01,080 --> 07:18:01,940
I have ten.

12192
07:18:04,920 --> 07:18:06,520
Put it down and then...

12193
07:18:06,520 --> 07:18:07,620
This is a block!

12194
07:18:07,700 --> 07:18:08,300
It's not...

12195
07:18:08,300 --> 07:18:09,540
It's not grass!

12196
07:18:10,680 --> 07:18:11,760
What are you talking about?

12197
07:18:13,000 --> 07:18:13,400
What?

12198
07:18:13,560 --> 07:18:14,760
This is another block.

12199
07:18:14,800 --> 07:18:15,980
It's not the grass.

12200
07:18:16,340 --> 07:18:17,100
Oh, hold on.

12201
07:18:18,040 --> 07:18:18,640
Oh shit.

12202
07:18:18,760 --> 07:18:19,520
Don't come for me.

12203
07:18:20,640 --> 07:18:21,440
Oh my god.

12204
07:18:22,400 --> 07:18:23,140
Use your shield.

12205
07:18:23,320 --> 07:18:26,700
They can't hit you if you have your shield up...

12206
07:18:26,700 --> 07:18:28,120
when they try to knock you back.

12207
07:18:28,980 --> 07:18:29,380
Oh, see?

12208
07:18:29,560 --> 07:18:30,060
You got him.

12209
07:18:30,200 --> 07:18:30,380
Easy.

12210
07:18:31,000 --> 07:18:31,440
Oh my god.

12211
07:18:31,800 --> 07:18:32,660
There's a ghast!

12212
07:18:32,660 --> 07:18:33,520
Oh my god.

12213
07:18:34,040 --> 07:18:36,260
There's so many things going on.

12214
07:18:36,380 --> 07:18:36,860
Oh my god.

12215
07:18:39,220 --> 07:18:39,740
Okay,

12216
07:18:44,500 --> 07:18:45,120
come on, come on.

12217
07:18:45,680 --> 07:18:46,580
I'm heading over.

12218
07:18:46,720 --> 07:18:48,320
How did you find this fortress?

12219
07:18:48,600 --> 07:18:49,920
Because I...

12220
07:18:49,920 --> 07:18:51,940
said, I was literally to my chat...

12221
07:18:51,940 --> 07:18:53,840
I was like, guys, the one...

12222
07:18:53,840 --> 07:18:55,740
the one...

12223
07:18:55,740 --> 07:18:58,120
biome we haven't been to is the basalt biome...

12224
07:18:58,120 --> 07:18:59,040
and that's where we have to go.

12225
07:19:00,480 --> 07:19:02,660
And then it was...

12226
07:19:02,660 --> 07:19:05,040
Why did everybody think you cheated?

12227
07:19:05,320 --> 07:19:06,400
Because they're assholes.

12228
07:19:06,540 --> 07:19:08,740
They hate me and they're trying to sabotage me.

12229
07:19:09,480 --> 07:19:10,280
Fine, you know what?

12230
07:19:10,300 --> 07:19:11,200
You can find it then.

12231
07:19:11,260 --> 07:19:11,900
You can find it.

12232
07:19:11,940 --> 07:19:12,400
No, no, no.

12233
07:19:12,540 --> 07:19:13,180
I believe you.

12234
07:19:13,200 --> 07:19:14,540
I'll just check the bot later.

12235
07:19:16,560 --> 07:19:18,440
Then you don't believe me!

12236
07:19:18,680 --> 07:19:19,120
No, no.

12237
07:19:19,200 --> 07:19:19,940
I believe you.

12238
07:19:20,040 --> 07:19:21,100
I believe you.

12239
07:19:22,780 --> 07:19:24,320
I believe you.

12240
07:19:25,020 --> 07:19:26,240
What's Hot Tourist Destination?

12241
07:19:26,380 --> 07:19:27,900
Did we just go through every single biome?

12242
07:19:27,900 --> 07:19:28,860
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

12243
07:19:28,980 --> 07:19:30,820
We didn't go through all the biomes.

12244
07:19:35,020 --> 07:19:35,960
Okay, come here.

12245
07:19:36,300 --> 07:19:36,460
Okay, come here.

12246
07:19:36,460 --> 07:19:37,020
We're going.

12247
07:19:38,460 --> 07:19:39,980
How did you go so...

12248
07:19:39,980 --> 07:19:41,340
I only went to here.

12249
07:19:42,340 --> 07:19:43,260
I only went to here.

12250
07:19:43,700 --> 07:19:44,840
And there it is.

12251
07:19:44,940 --> 07:19:45,700
You see it over there?

12252
07:19:46,060 --> 07:19:46,580
You see that?

12253
07:19:47,520 --> 07:19:48,760
You don't see that?

12254
07:19:49,460 --> 07:19:50,600
What do you mean you don't see that?

12255
07:19:50,660 --> 07:19:52,360
My render doesn't go that far.

12256
07:19:52,440 --> 07:19:53,080
Oh my God.

12257
07:19:55,960 --> 07:19:57,440
I need to get closer.

12258
07:19:57,880 --> 07:19:59,240
I need to get closer.

12259
07:19:59,240 --> 07:20:01,160
There's nothing there on my screen.

12260
07:20:01,420 --> 07:20:01,500
What?

12261
07:20:02,100 --> 07:20:03,200
Oh my God.

12262
07:20:03,480 --> 07:20:04,960
No wonder you wouldn't see anything then.

12263
07:20:05,320 --> 07:20:06,640
No wonder you thought everything was...

12264
07:20:06,640 --> 07:20:07,400
Square in the ground?

12265
07:20:07,660 --> 07:20:08,940
What's square in the ground?

12266
07:20:09,120 --> 07:20:11,780
I've never seen a fortress before, so I actually don't know what it looks like.

12267
07:20:11,920 --> 07:20:13,500
It's like just a bunch of brick.

12268
07:20:15,960 --> 07:20:17,780
You see that big chunk of brick?

12269
07:20:18,620 --> 07:20:19,100
That?

12270
07:20:19,420 --> 07:20:19,740
Yeah.

12271
07:20:20,580 --> 07:20:21,500
Oh shoot, I'm almost there.

12272
07:20:21,560 --> 07:20:22,480
Oh, that!

12273
07:20:23,820 --> 07:20:26,160
Wait, that's a fortress?

12274
07:20:26,160 --> 07:20:28,360
A fortress is just brick.

12275
07:20:28,540 --> 07:20:29,720
That's what I said!

12276
07:20:30,140 --> 07:20:32,200
It's just in front of us.

12277
07:20:32,280 --> 07:20:32,880
I know!

12278
07:20:34,100 --> 07:20:35,040
Oh my God, I hear a gasp.

12279
07:20:35,040 --> 07:20:36,920
That's what it was supposed to look like?

12280
07:20:37,120 --> 07:20:38,260
Yes, what did you expect?

12281
07:20:38,780 --> 07:20:40,880
I thought it would be like a fortress.

12282
07:20:41,380 --> 07:20:42,920
No, they're really lame.

12283
07:20:44,160 --> 07:20:47,140
Maybe we pass by a lot of these.

12284
07:20:48,040 --> 07:20:50,220
No, I don't think so.

12285
07:20:50,980 --> 07:20:55,240
They do not look very easy to see.

12286
07:20:56,980 --> 07:21:02,020
Oh, apparently it's very rare for it to spawn like that.

12287
07:21:02,220 --> 07:21:04,040
Well, we're in it.

12288
07:21:04,520 --> 07:21:05,180
We're in it.

12289
07:21:06,300 --> 07:21:07,280
There's the blazes!

12290
07:21:11,220 --> 07:21:15,300
Alright, time to dig down.

12291
07:21:15,380 --> 07:21:15,780
Are you ready?

12292
07:21:16,280 --> 07:21:16,840
Oh gosh.

12293
07:21:17,620 --> 07:21:19,480
We might actually fall in though.

12294
07:21:21,600 --> 07:21:22,400
This is it!

12295
07:21:22,440 --> 07:21:23,760
This is what we've been working for!

12296
07:21:23,760 --> 07:21:26,340
We worked so hard for this.

12297
07:21:26,440 --> 07:21:26,820
For this.

12298
07:21:26,940 --> 07:21:27,720
We have to live.

12299
07:21:28,700 --> 07:21:30,120
Yeah, see?

12300
07:21:30,380 --> 07:21:31,740
That's what I was afraid would happen.

12301
07:21:32,760 --> 07:21:33,200
Hey, move!

12302
07:21:33,440 --> 07:21:33,540
Move!

12303
07:21:36,060 --> 07:21:37,080
Oh my God.

12304
07:21:37,980 --> 07:21:41,400
We can maybe build a staircase like this.

12305
07:21:43,580 --> 07:21:44,860
I thought we did it.

12306
07:21:45,580 --> 07:21:47,140
We actually did it.

12307
07:21:47,400 --> 07:21:50,220
All it took was a bathroom, but we did it.

12308
07:21:50,580 --> 07:21:51,760
I fell down.

12309
07:21:51,760 --> 07:21:53,060
Okay, that's fine.

12310
07:21:53,340 --> 07:21:55,000
We do need a way out though.

12311
07:21:58,500 --> 07:21:58,920
Okay,

12312
07:22:03,920 --> 07:22:05,340
is that enough?

12313
07:22:05,480 --> 07:22:05,800
No.

12314
07:22:06,600 --> 07:22:07,600
Oh, that's not good.

12315
07:22:09,980 --> 07:22:10,820
What happened?

12316
07:22:10,960 --> 07:22:12,260
Wait, I don't like the sound of that.

12317
07:22:12,500 --> 07:22:13,760
Why did you say that?

12318
07:22:14,000 --> 07:22:15,900
No, I'm just trying to figure out a way out.

12319
07:22:16,740 --> 07:22:17,980
But it was like lava.

12320
07:22:17,980 --> 07:22:18,080
Lava.

12321
07:22:19,220 --> 07:22:21,980
I'm just gonna...

12322
07:22:22,520 --> 07:22:23,980
Do you hear the blazes?

12323
07:22:24,960 --> 07:22:25,260
No.

12324
07:22:25,580 --> 07:22:26,920
Try to get them up close.

12325
07:22:27,080 --> 07:22:28,740
Don't get them from far away.

12326
07:22:29,420 --> 07:22:31,220
What if there's Wither Skellies?

12327
07:22:31,440 --> 07:22:32,500
Put down torches.

12328
07:22:34,700 --> 07:22:36,820
What does the torches do?

12329
07:22:37,160 --> 07:22:39,180
They stop the Wither Skellies from spawning.

12330
07:22:40,060 --> 07:22:41,460
No, I'm not talking about that.

12331
07:22:41,560 --> 07:22:43,920
I'm just talking about what if I just encounter one?

12332
07:22:44,080 --> 07:22:44,960
Then don't fight it!

12333
07:22:44,960 --> 07:22:45,720
Don't fight it.

12334
07:22:46,380 --> 07:22:48,960
Because if it hits you, it'll like...

12335
07:22:49,860 --> 07:22:51,020
Oh my god, it's breathing.

12336
07:22:51,320 --> 07:22:53,140
Oh, I see one.

12337
07:22:53,660 --> 07:22:54,320
He's right there.

12338
07:22:54,380 --> 07:22:55,700
Oh no, the Wither Skelly!

12339
07:22:55,900 --> 07:22:56,340
Oh shoot.

12340
07:22:58,380 --> 07:22:59,520
Yeah, this is a good spot.

12341
07:23:00,000 --> 07:23:01,000
This is a good spot.

12342
07:23:03,040 --> 07:23:03,480
Nice.

12343
07:23:04,080 --> 07:23:05,480
Wait, what's that in front of us?

12344
07:23:05,800 --> 07:23:06,900
This is just basalt.

12345
07:23:08,900 --> 07:23:10,620
Oh my god, there's a bunch of Wither Skellies.

12346
07:23:11,260 --> 07:23:12,260
Yeah, I see them.

12347
07:23:13,240 --> 07:23:14,200
We don't want them.

12348
07:23:15,260 --> 07:23:16,000
Not this time.

12349
07:23:16,080 --> 07:23:17,140
That's not our goal.

12350
07:23:18,240 --> 07:23:20,180
Wither Skellies, you are not our goal this time.

12351
07:23:20,680 --> 07:23:21,760
Like, don't let them touch you.

12352
07:23:22,360 --> 07:23:23,380
Oh wait, we got the wards!

12353
07:23:24,640 --> 07:23:25,440
Oh yes, these!

12354
07:23:25,700 --> 07:23:26,340
We need these!

12355
07:23:26,860 --> 07:23:27,980
Some of them are...

12356
07:23:27,980 --> 07:23:29,040
Not grown though.

12357
07:23:29,120 --> 07:23:29,680
Oh, maybe they are.

12358
07:23:29,780 --> 07:23:31,060
Yeah, yeah.

12359
07:23:31,440 --> 07:23:32,100
This is what we need.

12360
07:23:32,120 --> 07:23:33,440
But I think the blazes are here.

12361
07:23:34,840 --> 07:23:35,920
No, that's a Wither Skelly.

12362
07:23:36,240 --> 07:23:36,680
Oh, where?

12363
07:23:38,060 --> 07:23:38,580
Over there.

12364
07:23:38,640 --> 07:23:40,160
No, I think I hear blazes to my left.

12365
07:23:40,160 --> 07:23:42,640
Hold on, I'm trying to make more...

12366
07:23:42,640 --> 07:23:44,160
I'm making more...

12367
07:23:45,600 --> 07:23:46,520
Okay, I see them.

12368
07:23:46,640 --> 07:23:47,460
I'm making more torches.

12369
07:23:49,400 --> 07:23:50,200
Yeah, bitch.

12370
07:23:51,080 --> 07:23:51,820
Yeah, bitch.

12371
07:23:52,220 --> 07:23:53,480
Yeah, they're right here.

12372
07:23:53,660 --> 07:23:54,400
In front of me.

12373
07:23:57,680 --> 07:23:58,700
They're not our goal.

12374
07:24:01,180 --> 07:24:01,980
Like the...

12375
07:24:01,980 --> 07:24:03,100
Oh, diamond!

12376
07:24:04,100 --> 07:24:05,860
Oh, I think I...

12377
07:24:05,860 --> 07:24:06,000
Ah!

12378
07:24:07,480 --> 07:24:08,780
What, what, what?

12379
07:24:08,980 --> 07:24:10,560
It was just a normal Skelly, but I ran.

12380
07:24:10,620 --> 07:24:12,880
Okay, I thought it was...

12381
07:24:12,880 --> 07:24:14,200
He freaked me out.

12382
07:24:14,220 --> 07:24:16,180
Oh my god.

12383
07:24:16,440 --> 07:24:17,760
I got freaked out a little.

12384
07:24:18,280 --> 07:24:20,200
But the blazes are here, I hear them.

12385
07:24:20,220 --> 07:24:20,680
Yeah, I do.

12386
07:24:20,800 --> 07:24:21,240
They're everywhere.

12387
07:24:22,220 --> 07:24:23,740
Oh god, they're breathing.

12388
07:24:24,240 --> 07:24:26,140
Why do they sound so scary?

12389
07:24:28,760 --> 07:24:30,160
Breathing really hard.

12390
07:24:30,660 --> 07:24:31,840
I think they're upstairs.

12391
07:24:32,400 --> 07:24:33,120
Are they upstairs?

12392
07:24:33,120 --> 07:24:33,840
Maybe.

12393
07:24:35,420 --> 07:24:36,780
I hear a Wither Skelly.

12394
07:24:38,940 --> 07:24:40,220
Oh shit!

12395
07:24:40,920 --> 07:24:42,660
You can block them.

12396
07:24:46,940 --> 07:24:50,000
I have a lot of experience with these guys.

12397
07:24:51,000 --> 07:24:52,420
Oh my god, you're gaming?

12398
07:24:52,700 --> 07:24:53,800
I got nothing though.

12399
07:24:54,900 --> 07:24:55,360
No!

12400
07:24:56,340 --> 07:24:57,200
Next up.

12401
07:24:59,260 --> 07:24:59,980
Oh, nothing here.

12402
07:24:59,980 --> 07:25:00,220
Nothing.

12403
07:25:01,240 --> 07:25:02,100
I'm just...

12404
07:25:02,100 --> 07:25:04,280
Are you sure?

12405
07:25:04,880 --> 07:25:06,800
You can go forward.

12406
07:25:07,620 --> 07:25:08,580
Oh, didn't trust me.

12407
07:25:08,640 --> 07:25:09,880
That's cool, that's fine.

12408
07:25:10,040 --> 07:25:11,380
Yeah, I'm just saying.

12409
07:25:11,460 --> 07:25:12,500
I was just double checking.

12410
07:25:13,680 --> 07:25:15,020
That's okay, that's okay.

12411
07:25:15,340 --> 07:25:15,940
It's fine.

12412
07:25:16,840 --> 07:25:18,980
Some people just don't trust others.

12413
07:25:19,660 --> 07:25:20,240
Where did he go?

12414
07:25:21,080 --> 07:25:22,680
I'm trying to see where they are.

12415
07:25:23,220 --> 07:25:24,500
I think they're all above us.

12416
07:25:26,440 --> 07:25:27,640
How do we get above?

12417
07:25:30,280 --> 07:25:31,900
We probably have to dig up.

12418
07:25:32,720 --> 07:25:33,220
Okay.

12419
07:25:33,960 --> 07:25:35,380
But we found this!

12420
07:25:35,480 --> 07:25:37,920
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

12421
07:25:37,940 --> 07:25:38,460
You guys.

12422
07:25:39,100 --> 07:25:40,780
This is where the real grind comes.

12423
07:25:41,520 --> 07:25:43,980
We don't even have enough for like...

12424
07:25:45,400 --> 07:25:46,960
Did we go here?

12425
07:25:48,180 --> 07:25:48,760
Where?

12426
07:25:50,740 --> 07:25:51,300
Here.

12427
07:25:51,880 --> 07:25:52,760
I don't see you.

12428
07:25:54,180 --> 07:25:55,720
The other exit.

12429
07:25:55,960 --> 07:25:56,640
Below the stairs.

12430
07:25:56,640 --> 07:25:57,100
Here, here, here.

12431
07:25:57,400 --> 07:25:59,400
No, we didn't go this way.

12432
07:25:59,980 --> 07:26:01,320
I'm grabbing the rest of the warts.

12433
07:26:02,820 --> 07:26:04,500
Did I grab some warts accidentally?

12434
07:26:04,720 --> 07:26:05,220
Oh, I did here.

12435
07:26:05,300 --> 07:26:06,240
Here's some nether warts too.

12436
07:26:07,260 --> 07:26:08,460
Alright, we didn't go here.

12437
07:26:09,720 --> 07:26:10,780
Oh, this is scary.

12438
07:26:10,940 --> 07:26:12,400
Okay, we didn't go here.

12439
07:26:15,060 --> 07:26:16,980
And I hear Wither Skelly.

12440
07:26:19,120 --> 07:26:19,920
Be careful.

12441
07:26:20,600 --> 07:26:22,540
Oh, there's more places here!

12442
07:26:23,100 --> 07:26:23,500
Okay.

12443
07:26:23,500 --> 07:26:23,660
Okay.

12444
07:26:27,400 --> 07:26:28,120
Watch me.

12445
07:26:28,200 --> 07:26:29,020
I'll get the blaze.

12446
07:26:29,580 --> 07:26:30,700
You get the Wither Skelly.

12447
07:26:31,240 --> 07:26:32,300
If you can find him.

12448
07:26:33,140 --> 07:26:33,740
I heard him.

12449
07:26:35,000 --> 07:26:35,940
I got obsidian too.

12450
07:26:36,260 --> 07:26:37,960
I got rib armor trim.

12451
07:26:38,180 --> 07:26:38,780
Do we want that?

12452
07:26:39,080 --> 07:26:39,920
No, we don't need it.

12453
07:26:41,180 --> 07:26:41,860
Oh shit.

12454
07:26:41,900 --> 07:26:42,800
Is that netherite?

12455
07:26:43,860 --> 07:26:45,480
Are armor trims netherite?

12456
07:26:45,820 --> 07:26:46,140
No.

12457
07:26:46,380 --> 07:26:47,560
Come here, come here.

12458
07:26:49,780 --> 07:26:51,280
There's more warts here too.

12459
07:26:52,080 --> 07:26:52,500
Got him.

12460
07:26:54,890 --> 07:26:56,230
I don't see...

12461
07:26:58,110 --> 07:26:59,390
Okay, run, run, run!

12462
07:26:59,890 --> 07:27:00,530
No!

12463
07:27:00,910 --> 07:27:02,450
I got hit!

12464
07:27:04,210 --> 07:27:05,950
They're on the side.

12465
07:27:06,150 --> 07:27:07,510
To the right.

12466
07:27:08,450 --> 07:27:09,330
Oh, there they are.

12467
07:27:09,670 --> 07:27:10,450
Oh my god.

12468
07:27:12,230 --> 07:27:14,610
I don't see...

12469
07:27:14,610 --> 07:27:15,670
the other skeleton.

12470
07:27:16,390 --> 07:27:17,210
That's okay.

12471
07:27:18,730 --> 07:27:19,730
He might be up.

12472
07:27:20,210 --> 07:27:21,110
I see magma cube.

12473
07:27:21,110 --> 07:27:24,010
Oh my god.

12474
07:27:24,250 --> 07:27:26,610
This is so confusing.

12475
07:27:29,850 --> 07:27:31,510
I told you, never give up.

12476
07:27:32,310 --> 07:27:33,550
Never give up.

12477
07:27:33,970 --> 07:27:35,730
Someone almost gave up.

12478
07:27:37,090 --> 07:27:38,590
Someone almost gave up.

12479
07:27:38,610 --> 07:27:39,370
I found it.

12480
07:27:39,750 --> 07:27:41,250
Someone almost gave up.

12481
07:27:41,350 --> 07:27:44,590
Before they found it, they almost gave up.

12482
07:27:47,550 --> 07:27:48,570
I remember.

12483
07:27:48,570 --> 07:27:50,030
We're like locked in now.

12484
07:27:50,210 --> 07:27:52,450
We're so...

12485
07:27:52,450 --> 07:27:53,810
If we can, we can.

12486
07:27:54,190 --> 07:27:55,170
Oh, there's a magma cube here.

12487
07:27:56,410 --> 07:27:57,150
Kill him!

12488
07:27:58,250 --> 07:27:59,110
Oh, I see him.

12489
07:27:59,670 --> 07:28:02,610
I think this is not a bad spawn though, because...

12490
07:28:04,910 --> 07:28:05,410
Honestly...

12491
07:28:06,090 --> 07:28:06,590
Like...

12492
07:28:06,590 --> 07:28:06,910
Okay.

12493
07:28:09,110 --> 07:28:11,510
I don't have any more torches, by the way.

12494
07:28:11,790 --> 07:28:12,050
Okay.

12495
07:28:14,750 --> 07:28:16,150
Oh, there's another blaze.

12496
07:28:16,150 --> 07:28:18,810
Oh my god!

12497
07:28:19,110 --> 07:28:23,210
I don't know where he was.

12498
07:28:23,330 --> 07:28:23,790
I don't know.

12499
07:28:24,570 --> 07:28:25,230
Shoot me!

12500
07:28:27,030 --> 07:28:28,530
Oh my god.

12501
07:28:29,850 --> 07:28:30,710
Kill him!

12502
07:28:30,790 --> 07:28:32,010
I got blaze rod!

12503
07:28:32,730 --> 07:28:34,090
Get a blaze rod!

12504
07:28:34,990 --> 07:28:37,570
How many blaze rods do we need?

12505
07:28:37,770 --> 07:28:38,450
I don't know.

12506
07:28:41,710 --> 07:28:43,490
That's a dead end.

12507
07:28:43,830 --> 07:28:45,450
That's a dead end right there.

12508
07:28:45,450 --> 07:28:47,910
Did you get the warts?

12509
07:28:48,950 --> 07:28:49,630
Yeah, I got them.

12510
07:28:50,290 --> 07:28:52,150
Oh, is this one of those that like drops off?

12511
07:28:52,450 --> 07:28:52,830
Okay, yeah.

12512
07:28:53,390 --> 07:28:54,330
That's what I was like.

12513
07:28:56,070 --> 07:28:56,990
We can do that.

12514
07:28:57,070 --> 07:28:57,410
There we go.

12515
07:28:57,790 --> 07:28:59,470
Oh, there's another wither skillie.

12516
07:28:59,810 --> 07:29:00,950
Oh, he dropped off.

12517
07:29:02,070 --> 07:29:05,750
Oh yeah, the rib armor trim would be so cool again if only we did it.

12518
07:29:06,870 --> 07:29:09,010
There's so many rib armor trim.

12519
07:29:09,750 --> 07:29:10,070
Yeah.

12520
07:29:10,070 --> 07:29:10,190
Yeah.

12521
07:29:13,070 --> 07:29:14,250
Ten rods is...

12522
07:29:14,250 --> 07:29:15,810
Okay, we need at least ten rods.

12523
07:29:16,390 --> 07:29:17,850
We gotta get the spawner then.

12524
07:29:19,130 --> 07:29:20,330
Do you have any more torches?

12525
07:29:20,770 --> 07:29:21,510
Yeah, I have some.

12526
07:29:21,990 --> 07:29:22,430
Where are you?

12527
07:29:24,150 --> 07:29:24,610
Upstairs?

12528
07:29:25,850 --> 07:29:26,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12529
07:29:26,470 --> 07:29:26,870
I'm here.

12530
07:29:27,930 --> 07:29:30,050
I guess I'll throw away the bone.

12531
07:29:31,990 --> 07:29:33,470
You're a single bone?

12532
07:29:34,030 --> 07:29:36,290
No, I have six bones.

12533
07:29:36,430 --> 07:29:38,710
I guess I'll get rid of it.

12534
07:29:38,710 --> 07:29:40,070
Oh, there's diamond horse armor.

12535
07:29:43,030 --> 07:29:44,630
I wish they would come closer.

12536
07:29:46,150 --> 07:29:47,170
I have arrows.

12537
07:29:47,570 --> 07:29:49,110
Yeah, but then we can't get the blaze rod.

12538
07:29:49,230 --> 07:29:50,030
They're all the way over there.

12539
07:29:51,470 --> 07:29:52,490
I think that's where the...

12540
07:29:52,490 --> 07:29:54,770
Okay, do you... Oh, you're...

12541
07:29:54,770 --> 07:29:55,890
You're what's it called?

12542
07:29:56,050 --> 07:29:56,110
Yeah.

12543
07:29:58,450 --> 07:30:00,990
Can you see where it looks like a jungle gym?

12544
07:30:01,930 --> 07:30:02,290
Yeah.

12545
07:30:02,490 --> 07:30:03,810
That's where the spawner is.

12546
07:30:04,530 --> 07:30:05,430
How do we get there?

12547
07:30:05,510 --> 07:30:07,190
Maybe it's like over here to our left?

12548
07:30:07,190 --> 07:30:10,310
Maybe, but it'll be really risky running over there.

12549
07:30:10,410 --> 07:30:11,550
Oh, there should be a guy here.

12550
07:30:11,810 --> 07:30:12,830
Oh, there he is!

12551
07:30:13,410 --> 07:30:14,250
Get his ass!

12552
07:30:15,650 --> 07:30:17,350
Oh, why did I get hit?

12553
07:30:17,370 --> 07:30:17,970
How did he hit you?

12554
07:30:18,090 --> 07:30:18,790
I don't know!

12555
07:30:21,550 --> 07:30:22,830
Did you kill him?

12556
07:30:23,270 --> 07:30:24,450
I killed one of them.

12557
07:30:25,850 --> 07:30:26,830
Ignore that guy.

12558
07:30:27,070 --> 07:30:27,670
Ignore that guy.

12559
07:30:29,030 --> 07:30:30,330
Ask me this way then.

12560
07:30:31,150 --> 07:30:32,710
If we can even get to it.

12561
07:30:32,910 --> 07:30:33,950
Actually, maybe we can.

12562
07:30:33,950 --> 07:30:34,730
Oh, hello.

12563
07:30:35,590 --> 07:30:36,570
I looted that, I think.

12564
07:30:37,350 --> 07:30:39,090
No, not this way.

12565
07:30:42,230 --> 07:30:44,130
The hardest part is like...

12566
07:30:44,130 --> 07:30:45,950
avoiding them when they're...

12567
07:30:46,490 --> 07:30:47,350
Oh, come here.

12568
07:30:48,250 --> 07:30:50,050
Because they like to fly away.

12569
07:30:51,390 --> 07:30:53,410
He's not above...

12570
07:30:53,410 --> 07:30:54,390
How did we get there?

12571
07:30:54,430 --> 07:30:55,950
I feel like we already went through all the entrances.

12572
07:30:56,770 --> 07:30:57,930
Sometimes it's not connected.

12573
07:30:58,250 --> 07:30:59,490
Sometimes it's like blocked off.

12574
07:31:00,830 --> 07:31:01,950
Okay, watch out for him.

12575
07:31:01,950 --> 07:31:02,550
Watch out for him.

12576
07:31:04,950 --> 07:31:06,690
Do we go drop down from here?

12577
07:31:07,370 --> 07:31:07,930
Oh, maybe.

12578
07:31:09,890 --> 07:31:10,910
It's like here, right?

12579
07:31:11,450 --> 07:31:12,610
We went down here though.

12580
07:31:14,210 --> 07:31:15,030
Oh my god, I hear him.

12581
07:31:16,550 --> 07:31:18,110
He's breathing in my ear.

12582
07:31:19,150 --> 07:31:19,510
Come on.

12583
07:31:19,530 --> 07:31:21,650
It's like around this general area.

12584
07:31:23,290 --> 07:31:24,470
No, it's not connected.

12585
07:31:24,910 --> 07:31:25,650
I don't think it's connected.

12586
07:31:25,830 --> 07:31:27,350
Oh wait, it's probably down this way.

12587
07:31:27,930 --> 07:31:28,650
Oh shit!

12588
07:31:28,650 --> 07:31:29,570
Oh no, Doki!

12589
07:31:29,830 --> 07:31:32,770
Doki, I'm not okay.

12590
07:31:32,970 --> 07:31:33,610
I'm not okay.

12591
07:31:34,350 --> 07:31:35,970
I'm not okay.

12592
07:31:36,470 --> 07:31:38,670
I'm not okay.

12593
07:31:41,430 --> 07:31:42,530
There's another one!

12594
07:31:42,850 --> 07:31:43,630
There's another one!

12595
07:31:44,830 --> 07:31:45,690
Okay, I got one of them.

12596
07:31:46,090 --> 07:31:47,870
Are you okay?

12597
07:31:48,070 --> 07:31:48,950
There's a blaze.

12598
07:31:50,130 --> 07:31:51,770
Yeah, I'm okay.

12599
07:31:52,410 --> 07:31:53,990
I just heard Dad howling.

12600
07:31:54,850 --> 07:31:56,050
I heard you howling...

12601
07:31:56,050 --> 07:31:57,750
Oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit, shit!

12602
07:31:58,270 --> 07:31:59,350
Um, I might not be okay.

12603
07:31:59,610 --> 07:32:00,750
Hold on, I'm retreating.

12604
07:32:00,910 --> 07:32:01,530
Tactical retreat!

12605
07:32:02,470 --> 07:32:03,150
Tactical retreat!

12606
07:32:03,890 --> 07:32:04,490
Tactical retreat!

12607
07:32:04,830 --> 07:32:05,030
Okay.

12608
07:32:05,810 --> 07:32:06,430
Oh my god.

12609
07:32:08,310 --> 07:32:08,850
Got him.

12610
07:32:10,590 --> 07:32:12,570
Yeah, there were two of them, there were two of them.

12611
07:32:13,410 --> 07:32:13,810
Okay.

12612
07:32:14,390 --> 07:32:15,410
You got it, you got it.

12613
07:32:15,490 --> 07:32:16,230
Oh my god.

12614
07:32:21,090 --> 07:32:21,890
We're okay!

12615
07:32:22,510 --> 07:32:22,970
We're okay!

12616
07:32:26,050 --> 07:32:27,850
Because my dog was also howling.

12617
07:32:27,930 --> 07:32:31,490
He was, I don't know, I think he heard us yelling and he's like, I wanna get in there.

12618
07:32:34,730 --> 07:32:36,430
He was like, howl!

12619
07:32:37,010 --> 07:32:38,630
I was like freaking out.

12620
07:32:38,630 --> 07:32:40,030
I was like, why is he howling?

12621
07:32:42,290 --> 07:32:43,550
Everything was happening.

12622
07:32:46,090 --> 07:32:47,070
Oh, there's magmas.

12623
07:32:50,490 --> 07:32:52,030
Oops, that's not what I meant to do.

12624
07:32:53,230 --> 07:32:54,090
Grabbing the magma.

12625
07:32:54,230 --> 07:32:57,090
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

12626
07:32:57,230 --> 07:32:58,170
Oh my god!

12627
07:32:59,050 --> 07:33:00,430
I think that was a good idea.

12628
07:33:01,210 --> 07:33:03,070
Why did they come at me like that?

12629
07:33:03,130 --> 07:33:03,670
Oh my gosh.

12630
07:33:03,970 --> 07:33:05,870
Because you're literally killing them, what do you mean?

12631
07:33:08,170 --> 07:33:08,610
No.

12632
07:33:08,610 --> 07:33:10,630
No, I would never, no.

12633
07:33:11,010 --> 07:33:12,010
What can I get rid of?

12634
07:33:14,630 --> 07:33:15,070
What?

12635
07:33:15,890 --> 07:33:16,330
What?

12636
07:33:17,050 --> 07:33:17,690
Oh my god.

12637
07:33:19,450 --> 07:33:19,770
Yeah.

12638
07:33:19,770 --> 07:33:21,070
Yeah, you got it.

12639
07:33:21,270 --> 07:33:21,630
Good job.

12640
07:33:24,530 --> 07:33:26,070
I hate weather skellies.

12641
07:33:26,810 --> 07:33:29,430
Oh, there's a, there's a blast, there's a, there's a blaze, blaze, blaze.

12642
07:33:30,710 --> 07:33:31,350
Yeah, fine.

12643
07:33:31,490 --> 07:33:32,850
Wait, which one was the spawner again?

12644
07:33:32,890 --> 07:33:33,350
Are we lost?

12645
07:33:33,630 --> 07:33:35,950
No, no, I know, I know where it was.

12646
07:33:36,030 --> 07:33:38,250
I don't wanna get rid of the string, what if I need to make a new bow?

12647
07:33:38,730 --> 07:33:39,910
Well, I guess I don't need the bow.

12648
07:33:40,350 --> 07:33:41,170
Oh, the quartz!

12649
07:33:41,290 --> 07:33:42,250
Thank you, I don't need the quartz.

12650
07:33:43,710 --> 07:33:45,030
What do I need to get rid of?

12651
07:33:45,030 --> 07:33:46,070
There we go, ok.

12652
07:33:47,370 --> 07:33:49,210
I need to keep my gold chest plate.

12653
07:33:49,290 --> 07:33:51,030
What if my gold helmet breaks, guys?

12654
07:33:51,810 --> 07:33:52,590
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

12655
07:33:52,670 --> 07:33:53,310
I think I heard a guy.

12656
07:33:54,350 --> 07:33:54,710
Nevermind.

12657
07:33:54,990 --> 07:33:55,530
Ok, we're good.

12658
07:33:55,570 --> 07:33:56,850
I think it's just the magma cubes.

12659
07:33:56,950 --> 07:33:57,710
Wait, so where was it?

12660
07:33:57,810 --> 07:33:58,450
Ok, this way?

12661
07:33:59,070 --> 07:34:01,730
But it's gonna be really dangerous going over there, I think.

12662
07:34:02,090 --> 07:34:03,590
I think we gotta take the sip.

12663
07:34:03,730 --> 07:34:04,750
I think we gotta take...

12664
07:34:04,750 --> 07:34:05,310
I don't know.

12665
07:34:05,470 --> 07:34:09,030
I think it's safer to just let them spawn where, when we...

12666
07:34:09,030 --> 07:34:10,510
Ok, there's a, yeah, get him.

12667
07:34:11,530 --> 07:34:12,430
I don't know why he's howling.

12668
07:34:12,430 --> 07:34:15,190
I don't know why he's howling right now.

12669
07:34:15,210 --> 07:34:15,610
Is your dog howling?

12670
07:34:15,890 --> 07:34:17,510
Yeah, my dog is howling.

12671
07:34:17,730 --> 07:34:19,370
Yeah, see, we have to, like, go down here.

12672
07:34:19,610 --> 07:34:20,370
He never howls.

12673
07:34:20,610 --> 07:34:22,430
I think it's just safer to...

12674
07:34:24,970 --> 07:34:25,410
To...

12675
07:34:25,410 --> 07:34:28,730
You can block the skellies in the hallways because they're three blocks tall.

12676
07:34:29,130 --> 07:34:30,170
Oh, really?

12677
07:34:33,650 --> 07:34:34,650
Ok, good to know.

12678
07:34:36,710 --> 07:34:37,470
I don't know.

12679
07:34:38,250 --> 07:34:39,450
I just wanna eat my dinner.

12680
07:34:41,950 --> 07:34:43,270
I'm making a wall.

12681
07:34:43,390 --> 07:34:43,990
I'm making a wall.

12682
07:34:44,190 --> 07:34:45,470
I need to check on my dog.

12683
07:34:45,550 --> 07:34:46,570
I need to know why he's howling.

12684
07:34:48,170 --> 07:34:48,870
We're back.

12685
07:34:48,950 --> 07:34:49,450
He's like...

12686
07:34:50,810 --> 07:34:52,230
I don't know, check in here.

12687
07:34:52,370 --> 07:34:54,750
And I was like, oh my god, why are you howling up your back?

12688
07:34:56,610 --> 07:34:57,330
Oh my god.

12689
07:35:02,850 --> 07:35:05,290
I got hit by a skelly.

12690
07:35:09,950 --> 07:35:11,370
I'm also gonna block this up.

12691
07:35:11,410 --> 07:35:14,530
Why do they keep spawning even though I put...

12692
07:35:14,530 --> 07:35:15,970
Maybe it's too dark here.

12693
07:35:17,090 --> 07:35:18,230
Oh, I thought that was one.

12694
07:35:18,350 --> 07:35:18,770
Oh my gosh.

12695
07:35:19,230 --> 07:35:19,770
Hey, you.

12696
07:35:20,350 --> 07:35:20,750
Come here.

12697
07:35:23,930 --> 07:35:25,450
Blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze.

12698
07:35:33,300 --> 07:35:35,120
How many magma cubes we got?

12699
07:35:35,440 --> 07:35:36,240
Only one?

12700
07:35:36,400 --> 07:35:37,860
We have the one magma cream?

12701
07:35:38,860 --> 07:35:39,840
Torches don't work?

12702
07:35:40,080 --> 07:35:41,980
No, they usually work for the skellies.

12703
07:35:41,980 --> 07:35:43,700
Why do I hear so many things?

12704
07:35:43,880 --> 07:35:48,340
I hear blaze, breeze, blaze, crackle, wither, skeleton, crackles.

12705
07:35:48,520 --> 07:35:49,620
What's going on?

12706
07:35:50,560 --> 07:35:51,640
I don't know.

12707
07:35:52,600 --> 07:35:53,560
What's going on?

12708
07:35:53,600 --> 07:35:55,140
Is anything bad happening outside?

12709
07:35:56,260 --> 07:35:56,580
Okay.

12710
07:35:57,080 --> 07:36:00,100
I thought they worked in here for the skellies at least.

12711
07:36:00,180 --> 07:36:01,260
I thought the torches worked.

12712
07:36:01,580 --> 07:36:03,420
My dog's okay, he's just...

12713
07:36:03,420 --> 07:36:04,320
He's being a dog?

12714
07:36:04,480 --> 07:36:06,080
Yeah, he's being a little freaky today.

12715
07:36:06,980 --> 07:36:09,840
Usually never... I think this is the second time I've ever heard him howl.

12716
07:36:09,840 --> 07:36:10,100
Oh my god.

12717
07:36:10,660 --> 07:36:10,940
Hello.

12718
07:36:10,940 --> 07:36:12,440
Yeah, there's a big guy right here.

12719
07:36:13,380 --> 07:36:14,780
He's just like on his pillow.

12720
07:36:15,200 --> 07:36:15,620
Just chilling.

12721
07:36:17,460 --> 07:36:19,740
Get him, get him so we can get magma cream.

12722
07:36:21,480 --> 07:36:22,880
But watch out for the size.

12723
07:36:23,040 --> 07:36:24,140
Don't go so far out.

12724
07:36:24,300 --> 07:36:24,900
That's what...

12725
07:36:24,900 --> 07:36:26,520
Oh wait, I forgot they like multiply.

12726
07:36:27,160 --> 07:36:27,440
Yeah.

12727
07:36:29,000 --> 07:36:29,960
And then again.

12728
07:36:30,200 --> 07:36:31,160
Yep, keep going.

12729
07:36:31,260 --> 07:36:31,960
And then again.

12730
07:36:32,520 --> 07:36:33,240
And then again.

12731
07:36:34,440 --> 07:36:35,860
And then again.

12732
07:36:36,560 --> 07:36:38,080
Did they give any magma cream?

12733
07:36:39,120 --> 07:36:40,000
They got me one.

12734
07:36:41,320 --> 07:36:42,700
Got rid of the bones again.

12735
07:36:43,360 --> 07:36:43,640
Okay.

12736
07:36:44,080 --> 07:36:46,040
You can hand it to me, I have the magma cream.

12737
07:36:46,160 --> 07:36:47,760
Do we need soul sand or soul soil?

12738
07:36:48,080 --> 07:36:49,260
None of... We don't need either.

12739
07:36:50,040 --> 07:36:52,160
Don't you need to plant the warts in the soul soil?

12740
07:36:52,460 --> 07:36:53,380
No, we have plenty.

12741
07:36:54,400 --> 07:36:55,840
Okay, so I'll get rid of that.

12742
07:36:56,000 --> 07:36:56,200
Okay.

12743
07:36:59,040 --> 07:36:59,900
Okay, here we go.

12744
07:37:00,120 --> 07:37:00,620
Come here.

12745
07:37:01,220 --> 07:37:01,760
Come here!

12746
07:37:03,160 --> 07:37:04,200
Come over here!

12747
07:37:05,800 --> 07:37:07,960
What if I kill him with my bow and arrow and then you...

12748
07:37:07,960 --> 07:37:09,160
Why did you just stand there?

12749
07:37:09,160 --> 07:37:10,900
I just wanted to look at him.

12750
07:37:10,960 --> 07:37:12,160
I'm gonna kill him and then you parkour.

12751
07:37:12,780 --> 07:37:13,100
No!

12752
07:37:14,060 --> 07:37:15,180
How was our parkour?

12753
07:37:15,280 --> 07:37:16,040
He's too far.

12754
07:37:16,980 --> 07:37:17,500
No, he's not.

12755
07:37:17,560 --> 07:37:18,560
He's literally right there.

12756
07:37:18,860 --> 07:37:20,620
There wasn't any rods anyway.

12757
07:37:20,760 --> 07:37:21,520
It doesn't matter.

12758
07:37:21,600 --> 07:37:24,440
It would've been eaten by the lava probably.

12759
07:37:24,860 --> 07:37:25,760
No, it didn't!

12760
07:37:25,880 --> 07:37:27,540
There was no lava over there!

12761
07:37:28,240 --> 07:37:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

12762
07:37:29,560 --> 07:37:30,600
Likely story.

12763
07:37:31,520 --> 07:37:33,460
Oh my gosh, there's so many Wither Skellies here.

12764
07:37:33,660 --> 07:37:34,260
This is crazy.

12765
07:37:34,420 --> 07:37:35,980
Just keep spawning, I think.

12766
07:37:36,880 --> 07:37:38,700
Wait, there's a Blaze Rod right in front of me.

12767
07:37:38,780 --> 07:37:39,400
I'm gonna do it.

12768
07:37:39,480 --> 07:37:40,120
Blaze Rod?

12769
07:37:40,740 --> 07:37:41,360
I mean Blaze.

12770
07:37:41,760 --> 07:37:41,780
Blaze.

12771
07:37:42,000 --> 07:37:43,220
No, you're not gonna be able to get...

12772
07:37:43,220 --> 07:37:44,420
Oh my god, Doki no, please.

12773
07:37:44,440 --> 07:37:45,000
I'm gonna do it.

12774
07:37:45,000 --> 07:37:45,480
Doki no.

12775
07:37:46,060 --> 07:37:46,380
Doki.

12776
07:37:46,440 --> 07:37:47,100
I'm gonna do it.

12777
07:37:47,120 --> 07:37:47,380
Doki.

12778
07:37:48,660 --> 07:37:49,180
I'm coming back.

12779
07:37:49,240 --> 07:37:49,700
I'm coming back.

12780
07:37:49,760 --> 07:37:50,340
I'm coming back.

12781
07:37:50,440 --> 07:37:51,880
I'm coming back.

12782
07:37:52,960 --> 07:37:54,320
I realized there was a mistake.

12783
07:38:00,100 --> 07:38:01,900
It was so fast.

12784
07:38:02,620 --> 07:38:03,400
Wait, hold on.

12785
07:38:03,600 --> 07:38:05,160
I gotta build a wall because...

12786
07:38:06,160 --> 07:38:06,720
That's it?

12787
07:38:06,820 --> 07:38:07,260
That's all I got?

12788
07:38:07,340 --> 07:38:07,700
That's it.

12789
07:38:07,740 --> 07:38:08,400
That's your wall.

12790
07:38:08,480 --> 07:38:08,840
You're here.

12791
07:38:09,280 --> 07:38:09,760
Thanks.

12792
07:38:09,960 --> 07:38:12,220
I gotta check if my YouTube keeps freezing.

12793
07:38:14,720 --> 07:38:15,720
Chat's frozen, guys.

12794
07:38:15,760 --> 07:38:16,140
I'm sorry.

12795
07:38:16,880 --> 07:38:17,500
I'm sorry.

12796
07:38:19,980 --> 07:38:20,900
One second.

12797
07:38:21,460 --> 07:38:22,360
Just in case.

12798
07:38:22,600 --> 07:38:24,740
Just in case, like, I get fucked over too.

12799
07:38:26,120 --> 07:38:29,520
I gotta make sure that I'm also safe.

12800
07:38:33,280 --> 07:38:33,720
Okay.

12801
07:38:33,720 --> 07:38:35,040
Oh, I hear so many noises.

12802
07:38:35,260 --> 07:38:37,480
I hear so many noises around us.

12803
07:38:39,260 --> 07:38:39,700
Okay.

12804
07:38:41,880 --> 07:38:42,760
Okay, are we safe?

12805
07:38:43,480 --> 07:38:45,440
Doki's counter says mint death 3.

12806
07:38:46,280 --> 07:38:47,520
No, it doesn't.

12807
07:38:49,540 --> 07:38:49,980
Gaslighting.

12808
07:38:49,980 --> 07:38:50,800
Why are you in here?

12809
07:38:50,960 --> 07:38:51,480
What the hell?

12810
07:38:51,820 --> 07:38:52,860
I was scared!

12811
07:38:53,440 --> 07:38:55,280
Oh my god, you have to be able to handle yourself.

12812
07:38:55,500 --> 07:38:56,780
Wait, how do I get out of here?

12813
07:38:56,900 --> 07:38:57,740
Which is...

12814
07:38:57,740 --> 07:38:59,500
Oh, okay.

12815
07:39:00,060 --> 07:39:00,440
I couldn't see.

12816
07:39:00,440 --> 07:39:01,760
Wait, how do we get out of here?

12817
07:39:01,760 --> 07:39:02,600
I couldn't tell!

12818
07:39:02,680 --> 07:39:03,360
It was dark!

12819
07:39:03,880 --> 07:39:04,160
Okay.

12820
07:39:05,740 --> 07:39:07,860
There must be a Blaze right above us.

12821
07:39:07,920 --> 07:39:08,860
We should go get him.

12822
07:39:09,480 --> 07:39:10,320
Yeah, I hear him.

12823
07:39:11,460 --> 07:39:12,000
You see him?

12824
07:39:12,780 --> 07:39:14,820
There's a lot of things right above us.

12825
07:39:14,920 --> 07:39:17,940
What the hell is going on up here?

12826
07:39:18,400 --> 07:39:19,360
It's a party!

12827
07:39:22,660 --> 07:39:26,020
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

12828
07:39:26,020 --> 07:39:29,520
I think I'm gonna go look... I'm gonna look for Blazes in other areas.

12829
07:39:29,760 --> 07:39:30,420
What are you gonna do?

12830
07:39:30,500 --> 07:39:31,200
Slam me?

12831
07:39:31,720 --> 07:39:32,980
Oh my god, don't give me a good time.

12832
07:39:32,980 --> 07:39:34,420
Other Blazes in your area.

12833
07:39:34,800 --> 07:39:36,400
Don't give me a good time.

12834
07:39:37,900 --> 07:39:39,080
We'll get the magma cube.

12835
07:39:39,420 --> 07:39:40,400
Magma cream, whatever.

12836
07:39:40,600 --> 07:39:41,880
Yeah, I'm getting the magma now.

12837
07:39:42,920 --> 07:39:45,420
Wait, did we ever go upstairs like this?

12838
07:39:45,760 --> 07:39:47,020
No, because it's scary.

12839
07:39:49,040 --> 07:39:50,220
Oh my god.

12840
07:39:51,440 --> 07:39:52,800
Oh my god, please.

12841
07:39:52,940 --> 07:39:54,480
I'm just...

12842
07:39:54,480 --> 07:39:55,380
Please get closer.

12843
07:39:57,220 --> 07:39:59,040
There's another magma cream right here.

12844
07:39:59,240 --> 07:40:02,080
Oh my god.

12845
07:40:04,500 --> 07:40:05,480
It's all right here.

12846
07:40:05,680 --> 07:40:06,520
Did you grab the magma cream?

12847
07:40:06,840 --> 07:40:07,260
Hold on.

12848
07:40:08,380 --> 07:40:09,120
Where is it?

12849
07:40:09,580 --> 07:40:10,020
Oh my god.

12850
07:40:10,080 --> 07:40:11,460
Oh my god, there's so many.

12851
07:40:11,620 --> 07:40:11,840
Yeah, I'm here.

12852
07:40:12,020 --> 07:40:13,140
I know, I know, I know.

12853
07:40:13,260 --> 07:40:13,610
That's what...

12854
07:40:14,380 --> 07:40:15,140
They're multiplying.

12855
07:40:15,700 --> 07:40:18,000
I like how this one pig is just watching us.

12856
07:40:18,300 --> 07:40:20,660
At least there's no Blazes up here.

12857
07:40:20,660 --> 07:40:25,780
We also have to get rid of these guys because then it'll spawn like other mobs.

12858
07:40:25,880 --> 07:40:26,820
Oh, we have been here.

12859
07:40:28,460 --> 07:40:30,000
Yeah, we've been up this way, yeah.

12860
07:40:30,580 --> 07:40:31,760
Yeah, you said we haven't.

12861
07:40:31,880 --> 07:40:35,540
No, I thought you meant like on... in that little area room.

12862
07:40:36,600 --> 07:40:37,300
There we go.

12863
07:40:37,380 --> 07:40:39,140
How many... Oh, I have only two.

12864
07:40:39,780 --> 07:40:40,980
I have one of them.

12865
07:40:41,100 --> 07:40:41,960
You got the other one.

12866
07:40:42,340 --> 07:40:42,920
This sucks.

12867
07:40:43,060 --> 07:40:44,020
They're not dropping anything.

12868
07:40:46,480 --> 07:40:47,940
They're so far away.

12869
07:40:48,360 --> 07:40:49,810
Why can't they spawn faster?

12870
07:40:49,810 --> 07:40:52,630
Put out some torches, Mint, so mobs spawn inside.

12871
07:40:53,050 --> 07:40:53,990
Which is it?

12872
07:40:54,070 --> 07:40:55,550
Do they... Do the torches work?

12873
07:40:55,690 --> 07:40:56,950
Do the torches not work?

12874
07:40:57,110 --> 07:41:00,270
I was just... You guys just said that the torches don't work.

12875
07:41:02,150 --> 07:41:03,290
What is it?

12876
07:41:04,230 --> 07:41:05,790
I got... I got fucking sniped.

12877
07:41:06,370 --> 07:41:07,870
He's like all the way over there.

12878
07:41:07,890 --> 07:41:11,250
I'm telling you, that's why... That's why you don't go out there.

12879
07:41:14,170 --> 07:41:18,030
We know... We know there's a spawner, but the spawner is danger zone.

12880
07:41:18,030 --> 07:41:20,730
The spawner is really far, guys.

12881
07:41:20,770 --> 07:41:21,710
We can't get there.

12882
07:41:21,850 --> 07:41:23,030
It's like separated.

12883
07:41:23,350 --> 07:41:24,390
We can't cross.

12884
07:41:27,770 --> 07:41:30,570
Right below where you were is a spawner thing?

12885
07:41:30,770 --> 07:41:31,570
Below us?

12886
07:41:31,670 --> 07:41:31,950
Below?

12887
07:41:32,790 --> 07:41:34,750
I think maybe they mean... Oh my God!

12888
07:41:35,070 --> 07:41:35,750
Oh my God, hello.

12889
07:41:36,610 --> 07:41:38,430
Wait, how did he get here?

12890
07:41:38,630 --> 07:41:39,770
He spawned.

12891
07:41:40,870 --> 07:41:41,950
Oh, blaze rod!

12892
07:41:42,150 --> 07:41:42,570
Nice.

12893
07:41:42,750 --> 07:41:43,290
We got two.

12894
07:41:43,430 --> 07:41:44,090
Okay, we got two.

12895
07:41:44,710 --> 07:41:44,930
Okay.

12896
07:41:44,930 --> 07:41:47,910
There's a much closer spawner?

12897
07:41:49,190 --> 07:41:49,670
Where?

12898
07:41:49,890 --> 07:41:50,290
There is?

12899
07:41:51,010 --> 07:41:52,130
I feel like we walked everywhere.

12900
07:41:52,290 --> 07:41:53,870
I feel like we walked everywhere too.

12901
07:41:54,930 --> 07:41:55,410
Yeah.

12902
07:41:56,690 --> 07:41:58,050
We went down here, yeah?

12903
07:42:00,070 --> 07:42:00,550
Okay.

12904
07:42:02,050 --> 07:42:03,270
We're getting one guide?

12905
07:42:03,430 --> 07:42:04,130
I can't tell.

12906
07:42:04,250 --> 07:42:07,390
There's one guide that said we're getting one guide, but there's three people said that...

12907
07:42:07,390 --> 07:42:13,310
I know, sometimes people will say one guide, but multiple people will say the same thing.

12908
07:42:13,310 --> 07:42:15,170
So I don't know.

12909
07:42:15,570 --> 07:42:16,550
Oh, hello.

12910
07:42:19,010 --> 07:42:20,070
Regular skelly.

12911
07:42:21,990 --> 07:42:23,110
I'm trying.

12912
07:42:24,510 --> 07:42:26,050
Stupid regular skelly.

12913
07:42:26,050 --> 07:42:27,150
Is next to the broken bridge?

12914
07:42:27,310 --> 07:42:28,750
There's a broken bridge?

12915
07:42:29,690 --> 07:42:31,170
Next to a broken bridge.

12916
07:42:33,170 --> 07:42:34,470
Are you okay?

12917
07:42:35,070 --> 07:42:35,830
I'm not okay.

12918
07:42:36,010 --> 07:42:36,670
I'm not okay.

12919
07:42:36,830 --> 07:42:37,610
I'm not okay.

12920
07:42:37,890 --> 07:42:38,910
I'm not okay.

12921
07:42:39,250 --> 07:42:40,150
Oh God, there's two of them!

12922
07:42:40,150 --> 07:42:40,950
Holy shit.

12923
07:42:41,270 --> 07:42:43,210
Remember when I said I wasn't okay?

12924
07:42:43,410 --> 07:42:43,670
I got one.

12925
07:42:45,030 --> 07:42:46,230
I got hit.

12926
07:42:46,330 --> 07:42:46,950
I got hit too.

12927
07:42:48,610 --> 07:42:49,530
Who's hitting us?

12928
07:42:49,550 --> 07:42:49,790
I got you.

12929
07:42:50,050 --> 07:42:50,650
It's a bow.

12930
07:42:50,770 --> 07:42:51,590
It's a skelly.

12931
07:42:51,810 --> 07:42:52,250
It's a skelly.

12932
07:42:52,270 --> 07:42:53,170
Regular skelly.

12933
07:42:53,350 --> 07:42:54,690
Regular old Joe Skelly.

12934
07:42:54,850 --> 07:42:55,290
Come on.

12935
07:42:56,110 --> 07:42:56,910
Watch out.

12936
07:43:00,230 --> 07:43:04,450
On the top floor right below the broken bridge?

12937
07:43:06,710 --> 07:43:09,110
What the fuck does any of those words mean?

12938
07:43:10,150 --> 07:43:18,150
On the top floor right below a broken bridge, there is a blaze spawner.

12939
07:43:18,790 --> 07:43:19,790
This floor?

12940
07:43:20,590 --> 07:43:22,170
The floor I'm on right now?

12941
07:43:22,950 --> 07:43:23,850
The scary floor?

12942
07:43:24,650 --> 07:43:25,330
Right here?

12943
07:43:26,430 --> 07:43:28,530
Right before a broken bridge?

12944
07:43:28,870 --> 07:43:29,630
Right here?

12945
07:43:30,250 --> 07:43:31,230
Oh my God.

12946
07:43:31,430 --> 07:43:31,690
Huh?

12947
07:43:31,750 --> 07:43:32,510
In the middle of summer?

12948
07:43:34,690 --> 07:43:35,710
Make shops?

12949
07:43:35,870 --> 07:43:37,750
I just started spamming.

12950
07:43:37,910 --> 07:43:39,250
I forget to make the shops.

12951
07:43:39,250 --> 07:43:40,530
This is the top floor.

12952
07:43:41,470 --> 07:43:42,990
This is the very top.

12953
07:43:45,070 --> 07:43:45,430
Here?

12954
07:43:45,870 --> 07:43:47,570
This is a broken bridge?

12955
07:43:48,090 --> 07:43:49,610
That broken bridge?

12956
07:43:50,390 --> 07:43:50,970
Watch out.

12957
07:43:51,110 --> 07:43:53,070
There's a guy who's going to start shooting.

12958
07:43:53,330 --> 07:43:55,070
There's 200 fucking things here.

12959
07:43:56,090 --> 07:43:59,570
I just left it right here to my left?

12960
07:44:00,830 --> 07:44:01,650
This one?

12961
07:44:06,070 --> 07:44:06,470
Where?

12962
07:44:06,630 --> 07:44:07,930
The War of Borealis?

12963
07:44:10,490 --> 07:44:11,250
Right here?

12964
07:44:11,370 --> 07:44:12,310
In the middle of the fortress?

12965
07:44:14,470 --> 07:44:15,410
Oh, there it is.

12966
07:44:15,490 --> 07:44:15,990
Yeah, there it is.

12967
07:44:16,890 --> 07:44:17,570
Wait, where?

12968
07:44:17,990 --> 07:44:18,770
Oh, I see you.

12969
07:44:18,790 --> 07:44:19,450
Yeah, there it is.

12970
07:44:21,850 --> 07:44:22,670
It's right there.

12971
07:44:22,830 --> 07:44:24,010
Look at the corner to your left.

12972
07:44:24,130 --> 07:44:26,190
I think it's the wither spawner.

12973
07:44:26,310 --> 07:44:28,290
There is no wither spawner.

12974
07:44:29,270 --> 07:44:30,030
Oh, wait.

12975
07:44:30,250 --> 07:44:31,150
Maybe it is.

12976
07:44:31,150 --> 07:44:33,270
Yeah, I think this is the wither spawner.

12977
07:44:33,610 --> 07:44:34,510
Oh my god.

12978
07:44:34,970 --> 07:44:37,850
It's just a wither... Wait, is that a thing?

12979
07:44:37,950 --> 07:44:38,530
A wither spawner?

12980
07:44:38,590 --> 07:44:39,890
Oh my god.

12981
07:44:43,050 --> 07:44:46,330
The one thing we... I didn't even know wither...

12982
07:44:46,330 --> 07:44:46,850
It's a blaze!

12983
07:44:47,370 --> 07:44:48,150
It's a blaze!

12984
07:44:49,190 --> 07:44:49,770
Oh shit.

12985
07:44:50,470 --> 07:44:53,090
I was gonna say, I don't think blaze spawners exist.

12986
07:44:54,850 --> 07:44:56,370
I'm trying to get rid of the skellies.

12987
07:44:56,790 --> 07:44:57,610
Get rid of everything.

12988
07:44:57,730 --> 07:44:58,210
Oh my god.

12989
07:44:59,550 --> 07:45:00,310
Oh my god.

12990
07:45:00,330 --> 07:45:01,030
We gotta build a bridge.

12991
07:45:01,110 --> 07:45:01,770
We gotta build a bridge.

12992
07:45:01,770 --> 07:45:01,930
I know.

12993
07:45:02,550 --> 07:45:05,310
Okay, one of us has to build and one of us has to take out the guys.

12994
07:45:05,710 --> 07:45:06,670
Okay, I got you.

12995
07:45:08,010 --> 07:45:08,770
I got the arrows.

12996
07:45:12,350 --> 07:45:12,670
Okay.

12997
07:45:15,070 --> 07:45:16,630
You can actually... Oh my god.

12998
07:45:16,730 --> 07:45:18,090
You need to defend yourself too though.

12999
07:45:18,190 --> 07:45:18,850
Okay, I'm gonna eat.

13000
07:45:20,650 --> 07:45:21,650
I'm running out of arrows.

13001
07:45:21,790 --> 07:45:22,770
I just need you to know that.

13002
07:45:22,890 --> 07:45:23,970
Oh, that's not good.

13003
07:45:24,150 --> 07:45:24,810
That's not great.

13004
07:45:25,090 --> 07:45:25,490
Oh shit.

13005
07:45:25,490 --> 07:45:26,810
Don't do it.

13006
07:45:26,850 --> 07:45:27,190
Don't cross.

13007
07:45:27,330 --> 07:45:27,590
Don't cross.

13008
07:45:27,750 --> 07:45:28,090
Don't cross.

13009
07:45:28,270 --> 07:45:29,450
I have my shield up.

13010
07:45:29,750 --> 07:45:30,610
I have my shield up.

13011
07:45:32,110 --> 07:45:33,050
I need to make bread.

13012
07:45:33,150 --> 07:45:33,870
I need to make bread.

13013
07:45:34,010 --> 07:45:34,610
I ran out of food.

13014
07:45:34,610 --> 07:45:36,530
Okay, there's three guys now, so...

13015
07:45:37,410 --> 07:45:38,030
That's not good.

13016
07:45:38,030 --> 07:45:38,850
I'm making bread.

13017
07:45:38,950 --> 07:45:39,670
I'm making bread.

13018
07:45:39,770 --> 07:45:40,490
Just calm down.

13019
07:45:40,610 --> 07:45:41,130
Calm down.

13020
07:45:41,210 --> 07:45:41,730
Calm down.

13021
07:45:41,990 --> 07:45:41,990
I'm calm.

13022
07:45:41,990 --> 07:45:42,530
I'm calm.

13023
07:45:44,090 --> 07:45:44,970
Oh my god.

13024
07:45:45,050 --> 07:45:46,030
Why is there a gas?

13025
07:45:46,030 --> 07:45:47,030
There's a gas?

13026
07:45:51,590 --> 07:45:54,310
I don't think I will be able to make it enough, everybody.

13027
07:45:59,230 --> 07:46:00,430
I got... I got one.

13028
07:46:02,410 --> 07:46:03,610
Where's our gas from?

13029
07:46:04,310 --> 07:46:04,890
I don't know.

13030
07:46:05,270 --> 07:46:06,110
Stop getting hit.

13031
07:46:06,250 --> 07:46:06,930
Stop getting hit.

13032
07:46:08,790 --> 07:46:09,610
I killed two.

13033
07:46:09,750 --> 07:46:10,290
I killed two.

13034
07:46:10,770 --> 07:46:11,190
Oh my god.

13035
07:46:11,230 --> 07:46:11,630
You're gaming.

13036
07:46:11,730 --> 07:46:12,730
You're gaming right now.

13037
07:46:13,250 --> 07:46:14,730
I ran out of arrows, so it's up to you.

13038
07:46:14,750 --> 07:46:15,330
I killed three.

13039
07:46:16,370 --> 07:46:17,230
Alright, you did it.

13040
07:46:17,270 --> 07:46:17,710
You did it.

13041
07:46:17,730 --> 07:46:18,770
You should be able to go now.

13042
07:46:18,950 --> 07:46:20,150
Okay, but... Help me.

13043
07:46:20,190 --> 07:46:20,450
Help me.

13044
07:46:20,470 --> 07:46:20,670
Help me.

13045
07:46:20,710 --> 07:46:20,850
Here.

13046
07:46:20,910 --> 07:46:21,070
Here.

13047
07:46:21,210 --> 07:46:21,290
Here.

13048
07:46:21,310 --> 07:46:21,390
Here.

13049
07:46:21,390 --> 07:46:21,450
Here.

13050
07:46:21,710 --> 07:46:21,990
Half.

13051
07:46:22,250 --> 07:46:22,750
I give you half.

13052
07:46:22,850 --> 07:46:23,350
I give you half.

13053
07:46:23,470 --> 07:46:23,610
Okay.

13054
07:46:23,710 --> 07:46:23,890
How?

13055
07:46:23,950 --> 07:46:24,130
How?

13056
07:46:24,210 --> 07:46:24,350
How?

13057
07:46:24,610 --> 07:46:24,890
I...

13058
07:46:24,890 --> 07:46:25,330
Take it.

13059
07:46:25,370 --> 07:46:25,550
Take it.

13060
07:46:25,570 --> 07:46:25,790
Take it.

13061
07:46:25,790 --> 07:46:28,030
Okay, I need to know there's a gas somewhere.

13062
07:46:28,130 --> 07:46:28,870
There's a gas somewhere.

13063
07:46:29,630 --> 07:46:29,950
Somewhere.

13064
07:46:30,190 --> 07:46:30,390
Somewhere.

13065
07:46:31,590 --> 07:46:33,190
Okay, I'm gonna speed this.

13066
07:46:34,070 --> 07:46:34,510
Oh my god.

13067
07:46:34,810 --> 07:46:35,490
Oh my god.

13068
07:46:35,530 --> 07:46:36,170
You don't come back.

13069
07:46:36,290 --> 07:46:36,530
Come back.

13070
07:46:36,630 --> 07:46:36,970
Come back.

13071
07:46:37,270 --> 07:46:37,650
Come back.

13072
07:46:37,770 --> 07:46:38,410
I heard a blaze.

13073
07:46:38,490 --> 07:46:39,110
I heard a blaze.

13074
07:46:39,210 --> 07:46:39,490
I hear him.

13075
07:46:39,550 --> 07:46:40,130
He's right here.

13076
07:46:40,270 --> 07:46:40,730
Build a wall.

13077
07:46:41,990 --> 07:46:42,310
Here.

13078
07:46:43,290 --> 07:46:44,230
You keep building the bridge.

13079
07:46:44,310 --> 07:46:44,610
Build the bridge.

13080
07:46:44,730 --> 07:46:45,030
Build the bridge.

13081
07:46:45,310 --> 07:46:45,690
Build the bridge.

13082
07:46:45,910 --> 07:46:46,630
Oh, he came back.

13083
07:46:46,730 --> 07:46:47,070
He came back.

13084
07:46:47,170 --> 07:46:47,450
He came back.

13085
07:46:47,530 --> 07:46:47,990
Oh shit!

13086
07:46:48,370 --> 07:46:49,110
Ah, shit!

13087
07:46:50,050 --> 07:46:51,330
I gotta eat, I gotta eat.

13088
07:46:52,330 --> 07:46:53,270
I'm gonna drink it!

13089
07:46:53,370 --> 07:46:54,550
I'm gonna drink the fire resistance!

13090
07:46:54,830 --> 07:46:54,910
No!

13091
07:46:54,910 --> 07:46:54,910
No!

13092
07:46:56,190 --> 07:46:58,030
Actually, that might be the good...

13093
07:46:58,030 --> 07:46:59,650
Actually, this might be the good time to do it.

13094
07:47:00,110 --> 07:47:00,830
I'm gonna do it.

13095
07:47:01,410 --> 07:47:01,770
Okay.

13096
07:47:02,770 --> 07:47:03,910
Keep building, keep building!

13097
07:47:05,890 --> 07:47:07,550
I need you to build for me.

13098
07:47:07,630 --> 07:47:08,070
What do you...

13099
07:47:08,070 --> 07:47:08,650
What do you mean?

13100
07:47:08,790 --> 07:47:10,150
You have the fire resistance!

13101
07:47:10,970 --> 07:47:11,530
Why did you...

13102
07:47:11,530 --> 07:47:11,930
Can I still get hit?

13103
07:47:12,490 --> 07:47:13,550
Yes, you can get hit!

13104
07:47:16,270 --> 07:47:17,090
Would I die?

13105
07:47:17,990 --> 07:47:19,830
Oh, I missed him.

13106
07:47:22,930 --> 07:47:23,410
No!

13107
07:47:25,730 --> 07:47:27,150
Just spam attack!

13108
07:47:27,370 --> 07:47:29,330
The fire can't hurt you right now!

13109
07:47:33,770 --> 07:47:34,670
Okay, okay!

13110
07:47:36,810 --> 07:47:38,110
Oh shit, oh shit.

13111
07:47:39,410 --> 07:47:40,230
Where are they?

13112
07:47:41,230 --> 07:47:41,890
Oh my god.

13113
07:47:41,990 --> 07:47:43,170
Okay, I gotta drink my potion.

13114
07:47:43,250 --> 07:47:44,050
I gotta drink my potion.

13115
07:47:44,690 --> 07:47:45,890
I'm hitting them.

13116
07:47:45,990 --> 07:47:47,130
I gotta drink my potion.

13117
07:47:47,230 --> 07:47:47,550
Where's my potion?

13118
07:47:49,970 --> 07:47:51,130
Okay, I'm coming in!

13119
07:47:52,090 --> 07:47:54,130
Oh my god, they're still hitting me!

13120
07:47:54,330 --> 07:47:56,450
It doesn't hurt me, but why am I still getting hit?

13121
07:47:56,690 --> 07:47:58,130
Why am I still getting hit?

13122
07:47:58,690 --> 07:47:59,310
Wait, really?

13123
07:47:59,670 --> 07:48:00,470
With the fire even?

13124
07:48:01,070 --> 07:48:01,410
Yeah.

13125
07:48:03,070 --> 07:48:03,970
Wait, do you have torches?

13126
07:48:04,030 --> 07:48:04,710
Do you have extra torches?

13127
07:48:05,270 --> 07:48:06,590
Someone said she has full HP.

13128
07:48:07,250 --> 07:48:08,610
Oh, hey, I have six.

13129
07:48:09,090 --> 07:48:10,130
What the fuck, man?

13130
07:48:11,770 --> 07:48:12,950
Okay, I'm out of torches.

13131
07:48:12,950 --> 07:48:13,830
I'm out of torches?

13132
07:48:13,910 --> 07:48:14,830
I have torches.

13133
07:48:15,030 --> 07:48:15,890
I'm okay now.

13134
07:48:15,970 --> 07:48:17,310
Okay, we need to get these guys.

13135
07:48:17,530 --> 07:48:18,350
Oh my god.

13136
07:48:20,590 --> 07:48:22,310
Please, come over here and die.

13137
07:48:23,730 --> 07:48:25,290
I'm just gonna put this here for now.

13138
07:48:25,610 --> 07:48:26,750
I can't.

13139
07:48:27,310 --> 07:48:29,250
Regular-ass Skelly, get out of the way!

13140
07:48:29,350 --> 07:48:31,450
I need these guys to get out first.

13141
07:48:32,090 --> 07:48:32,770
Okay, hold on.

13142
07:48:34,850 --> 07:48:37,590
We'll let them spawn in when things start calming down.

13143
07:48:37,810 --> 07:48:38,390
He's on me!

13144
07:48:38,510 --> 07:48:38,950
He's on me!

13145
07:48:39,030 --> 07:48:39,630
Oh my god.

13146
07:48:39,630 --> 07:48:43,050
Who is... There's 20 things on me too!

13147
07:48:47,630 --> 07:48:49,410
Oh, they can do melee damage?

13148
07:48:49,670 --> 07:48:50,030
Wow.

13149
07:48:50,770 --> 07:48:52,690
Give them more stuff to do, I guess.

13150
07:48:55,950 --> 07:48:56,570
I got it.

13151
07:48:56,690 --> 07:48:58,450
Blaze rod, blaze rod, blaze rod, blaze rod.

13152
07:48:58,990 --> 07:49:00,570
I have... I have four blaze rods.

13153
07:49:00,770 --> 07:49:01,570
I can't pick it up.

13154
07:49:01,710 --> 07:49:02,350
I need you to pick it up.

13155
07:49:02,990 --> 07:49:04,590
I got it, I got it, I got it.

13156
07:49:05,270 --> 07:49:06,550
It's up here, it's up here, it's up here.

13157
07:49:07,030 --> 07:49:07,310
Up here.

13158
07:49:10,710 --> 07:49:13,330
What's the point of attacking these bozos?

13159
07:49:13,810 --> 07:49:13,870
Okay.

13160
07:49:14,230 --> 07:49:16,770
Oh my god, I'm getting a stomachache from all this.

13161
07:49:17,010 --> 07:49:20,430
Oh my god, I'm gonna freak out soon.

13162
07:49:21,570 --> 07:49:22,670
How much is left?

13163
07:49:22,790 --> 07:49:23,410
It's gonna be like...

13164
07:49:23,410 --> 07:49:25,370
Okay, a minute and a half left on my thing.

13165
07:49:25,530 --> 07:49:27,030
You probably have less than.

13166
07:49:27,590 --> 07:49:29,850
It's gonna be my fifth freakout right here.

13167
07:49:30,590 --> 07:49:32,110
Oh, I just fell inside.

13168
07:49:32,270 --> 07:49:32,690
Oh my god.

13169
07:49:33,030 --> 07:49:33,250
No.

13170
07:49:33,750 --> 07:49:34,270
Oh no.

13171
07:49:34,270 --> 07:49:34,310
Oh no.

13172
07:49:37,390 --> 07:49:39,090
Alright, they're gonna spawn in again.

13173
07:49:40,030 --> 07:49:40,250
Okay.

13174
07:49:41,370 --> 07:49:42,790
I'm building our escape route.

13175
07:49:42,870 --> 07:49:45,210
I'm building our escape route while it's calm.

13176
07:49:46,030 --> 07:49:46,890
I don't have arrows.

13177
07:49:47,030 --> 07:49:47,490
Do you have?

13178
07:49:47,590 --> 07:49:47,890
Oh, I do.

13179
07:49:50,430 --> 07:49:51,430
Try and kill them.

13180
07:49:51,430 --> 07:49:52,770
Try and kill them here though.

13181
07:49:53,170 --> 07:49:54,210
How many do I have left?

13182
07:49:54,250 --> 07:49:55,250
How many do I have left?

13183
07:49:55,290 --> 07:49:55,950
I can't see.

13184
07:49:56,050 --> 07:49:56,830
I can't see.

13185
07:49:57,010 --> 07:49:57,750
Use your shield!

13186
07:49:58,570 --> 07:50:00,630
One... One... One second is gone.

13187
07:50:00,970 --> 07:50:01,870
I don't have fire resistance.

13188
07:50:02,070 --> 07:50:03,030
I'm waiting for the spawner.

13189
07:50:03,030 --> 07:50:03,890
I got another.

13190
07:50:04,090 --> 07:50:04,450
I got another.

13191
07:50:05,030 --> 07:50:05,710
Nice, nice.

13192
07:50:06,230 --> 07:50:06,830
I got five.

13193
07:50:07,770 --> 07:50:08,790
You have six, right?

13194
07:50:08,810 --> 07:50:09,370
You have one, right?

13195
07:50:09,530 --> 07:50:10,010
I have one.

13196
07:50:11,370 --> 07:50:12,090
Oh shit.

13197
07:50:12,410 --> 07:50:12,750
Oh shit.

13198
07:50:13,530 --> 07:50:13,690
Okay.

13199
07:50:13,950 --> 07:50:14,490
Oh, you're fine.

13200
07:50:14,610 --> 07:50:14,950
You're fine.

13201
07:50:15,010 --> 07:50:15,270
You're fine.

13202
07:50:15,270 --> 07:50:15,630
You're fine.

13203
07:50:15,650 --> 07:50:15,870
Sure.

13204
07:50:16,430 --> 07:50:16,930
Sure, sure.

13205
07:50:17,290 --> 07:50:17,970
There's another arrow.

13206
07:50:18,070 --> 07:50:18,570
There's another one.

13207
07:50:18,890 --> 07:50:19,310
Oh my god.

13208
07:50:19,350 --> 07:50:21,250
These guys... I'm gonna murder them.

13209
07:50:21,330 --> 07:50:22,070
I'm gonna murder them.

13210
07:50:22,770 --> 07:50:23,730
These stupid skellies.

13211
07:50:23,790 --> 07:50:24,510
I hate them so much.

13212
07:50:24,930 --> 07:50:27,150
Oh, there's another spawner in front of us!

13213
07:50:27,250 --> 07:50:27,610
Yes!

13214
07:50:27,670 --> 07:50:30,370
There's another... That's the one that I was looking at!

13215
07:50:33,490 --> 07:50:35,650
I'm gonna block... I'm gonna block this area.

13216
07:50:35,750 --> 07:50:36,670
I'm gonna block this area.

13217
07:50:37,450 --> 07:50:39,870
I need to heal before we go in.

13218
07:50:39,890 --> 07:50:40,290
I can.

13219
07:50:40,410 --> 07:50:40,890
Okay, I can.

13220
07:50:41,210 --> 07:50:41,410
Okay.

13221
07:50:44,410 --> 07:50:45,930
Okay, I have six.

13222
07:50:45,990 --> 07:50:46,390
I have six.

13223
07:50:46,530 --> 07:50:48,310
We need... Oh, I need ten.

13224
07:50:48,390 --> 07:50:48,610
Okay.

13225
07:50:48,630 --> 07:50:50,250
Yeah, we need several more.

13226
07:50:50,830 --> 07:50:52,390
I'll break the torches again.

13227
07:50:52,730 --> 07:50:54,030
I needed it to calm down.

13228
07:50:54,110 --> 07:50:55,270
I needed things to calm down...

13229
07:50:55,270 --> 07:50:56,590
Okay, I'm blocking these walls.

13230
07:50:56,770 --> 07:50:57,690
I'm blocking these walls.

13231
07:51:00,690 --> 07:51:01,950
Okay, I'm blocking...

13232
07:51:04,850 --> 07:51:08,390
Actually... Yeah, like, make it so that when they spawn in...

13233
07:51:08,390 --> 07:51:09,150
They can't leave.

13234
07:51:10,230 --> 07:51:10,790
Oh my god.

13235
07:51:10,870 --> 07:51:11,050
No!

13236
07:51:13,150 --> 07:51:13,790
Are you okay?

13237
07:51:14,650 --> 07:51:14,990
No.

13238
07:51:15,570 --> 07:51:16,050
Oh my god.

13239
07:51:16,110 --> 07:51:16,270
Hello.

13240
07:51:16,630 --> 07:51:17,050
Oh my god.

13241
07:51:17,930 --> 07:51:18,790
I'm not okay.

13242
07:51:20,130 --> 07:51:21,370
I need to heal.

13243
07:51:21,470 --> 07:51:22,350
I'm not okay.

13244
07:51:22,670 --> 07:51:24,090
I'm not okay anymore.

13245
07:51:24,110 --> 07:51:24,510
Get behind me.

13246
07:51:24,550 --> 07:51:24,870
Get behind me.

13247
07:51:29,150 --> 07:51:30,230
Okay, I need to heal.

13248
07:51:30,430 --> 07:51:31,050
I need to heal.

13249
07:51:31,050 --> 07:51:31,570
Go heal.

13250
07:51:31,770 --> 07:51:32,610
I'm not okay.

13251
07:51:32,750 --> 07:51:35,230
I'm actually... I'm gonna fucking collapse.

13252
07:51:35,710 --> 07:51:36,370
Okay, I killed him.

13253
07:51:36,990 --> 07:51:37,270
Okay.

13254
07:51:37,610 --> 07:51:38,230
I got two.

13255
07:51:38,250 --> 07:51:38,930
I got two rounds.

13256
07:51:39,050 --> 07:51:39,530
I got two rounds.

13257
07:51:39,830 --> 07:51:40,550
Okay, we have A.

13258
07:51:40,650 --> 07:51:41,070
We have A.

13259
07:51:43,210 --> 07:51:45,730
Oh, your helmet broke.

13260
07:51:45,890 --> 07:51:46,550
Your helmet broke.

13261
07:51:46,590 --> 07:51:47,530
Oh, is that why?

13262
07:51:47,650 --> 07:51:49,390
Okay, that makes more sense.

13263
07:51:49,490 --> 07:51:51,210
That's why I was taking so much fucking damage.

13264
07:51:51,570 --> 07:51:52,710
Oh my god!

13265
07:51:52,990 --> 07:51:53,750
Oh my god.

13266
07:51:55,850 --> 07:51:56,630
Go back!

13267
07:51:56,770 --> 07:51:56,970
Go back!

13268
07:51:56,990 --> 07:51:57,370
Go back!

13269
07:51:57,410 --> 07:51:57,870
Go back!

13270
07:51:58,890 --> 07:51:59,710
Throw a grenade!

13271
07:52:02,430 --> 07:52:03,130
Oh my god.

13272
07:52:04,070 --> 07:52:05,610
When they're on... Oh my god.

13273
07:52:05,670 --> 07:52:07,810
When they're on fire, they're about to, like, attack.

13274
07:52:08,030 --> 07:52:12,450
So, like, attack when they're not on fire, and then, like, shield up when they get on fire.

13275
07:52:14,070 --> 07:52:14,670
Oh my god!

13276
07:52:14,710 --> 07:52:15,870
How did that still hit me?

13277
07:52:16,030 --> 07:52:17,290
How did that still hit me?

13278
07:52:17,930 --> 07:52:18,590
I'm backing up.

13279
07:52:18,670 --> 07:52:19,670
Don't be a hero, Mint.

13280
07:52:19,690 --> 07:52:20,310
Don't be a hero.

13281
07:52:20,310 --> 07:52:20,930
Okay, I gotta heal.

13282
07:52:21,050 --> 07:52:21,350
I gotta heal.

13283
07:52:21,350 --> 07:52:21,990
Don't be a hero.

13284
07:52:22,090 --> 07:52:22,530
I gotta heal.

13285
07:52:24,090 --> 07:52:24,770
Oh my god!

13286
07:52:25,230 --> 07:52:26,890
I don't have arrows, guys!

13287
07:52:26,970 --> 07:52:27,470
Oh, I do.

13288
07:52:27,930 --> 07:52:28,390
Oh my god.

13289
07:52:28,830 --> 07:52:29,390
Do you have arrows?

13290
07:52:29,450 --> 07:52:29,810
Do you have arrows?

13291
07:52:29,810 --> 07:52:31,310
Yes, here.

13292
07:52:31,470 --> 07:52:31,990
Spectral arrows.

13293
07:52:32,150 --> 07:52:32,470
There you go.

13294
07:52:32,590 --> 07:52:32,850
There you go.

13295
07:52:33,190 --> 07:52:33,930
Give me all of it.

13296
07:52:33,990 --> 07:52:34,310
Give me all your arrows.

13297
07:52:34,310 --> 07:52:35,230
I gave you all.

13298
07:52:35,350 --> 07:52:35,790
I gave you all.

13299
07:52:41,060 --> 07:52:41,640
Oh my god.

13300
07:52:42,080 --> 07:52:42,600
Oh my god.

13301
07:52:42,640 --> 07:52:43,420
They're still spawning.

13302
07:52:44,820 --> 07:52:45,460
Oh shit!

13303
07:52:45,560 --> 07:52:45,880
Shit!

13304
07:52:46,500 --> 07:52:47,540
I killed three.

13305
07:52:47,640 --> 07:52:48,140
I killed three.

13306
07:52:49,460 --> 07:52:50,660
I don't have any more torches!

13307
07:52:51,780 --> 07:52:52,500
I have torches.

13308
07:52:52,600 --> 07:52:52,740
Okay.

13309
07:52:54,480 --> 07:52:55,040
Oh my god!

13310
07:52:55,060 --> 07:52:56,220
How is it still hitting me?

13311
07:52:56,320 --> 07:52:57,780
I don't have any more arrows.

13312
07:52:58,200 --> 07:53:00,360
I don't have any more arrows.

13313
07:53:01,460 --> 07:53:02,500
I don't have any more.

13314
07:53:02,560 --> 07:53:03,160
I don't have any.

13315
07:53:03,360 --> 07:53:04,080
Okay, okay, okay.

13316
07:53:04,180 --> 07:53:05,360
I'm going in.

13317
07:53:08,080 --> 07:53:08,560
Get out!

13318
07:53:08,680 --> 07:53:08,820
Get out!

13319
07:53:08,840 --> 07:53:09,020
Get out!

13320
07:53:09,360 --> 07:53:09,640
Get out!

13321
07:53:09,720 --> 07:53:10,340
I can't risk it!

13322
07:53:10,440 --> 07:53:10,840
I can't risk it!

13323
07:53:10,880 --> 07:53:11,620
I can't!

13324
07:53:14,800 --> 07:53:15,920
We can't get out!

13325
07:53:16,140 --> 07:53:16,480
We can't!

13326
07:53:16,720 --> 07:53:20,960
The thing is, we have to return home, but this is the only way we can go home!

13327
07:53:22,380 --> 07:53:23,040
Oh my god.

13328
07:53:24,420 --> 07:53:25,540
This is the only...

13329
07:53:25,540 --> 07:53:25,820
I know.

13330
07:53:25,980 --> 07:53:26,200
I know.

13331
07:53:26,240 --> 07:53:26,460
I know.

13332
07:53:26,780 --> 07:53:27,040
I know.

13333
07:53:27,100 --> 07:53:28,080
I'm drinking the other potion.

13334
07:53:28,080 --> 07:53:29,280
You have another potion?!

13335
07:53:29,280 --> 07:53:30,400
I'm drinking one more potion.

13336
07:53:30,480 --> 07:53:30,980
I'm going in.

13337
07:53:31,120 --> 07:53:31,780
I'm going in.

13338
07:53:31,940 --> 07:53:33,220
I'm going in with these potions.

13339
07:53:33,320 --> 07:53:33,740
Okay, okay.

13340
07:53:34,180 --> 07:53:34,860
I've got it.

13341
07:53:35,800 --> 07:53:36,680
I'm going in.

13342
07:53:38,080 --> 07:53:39,300
I can't leave!

13343
07:53:39,780 --> 07:53:41,580
I got another rod though.

13344
07:53:41,660 --> 07:53:42,100
That's cool.

13345
07:53:42,880 --> 07:53:43,800
How many do we need?

13346
07:53:45,200 --> 07:53:46,060
I don't know.

13347
07:53:46,780 --> 07:53:47,520
I went in.

13348
07:53:47,540 --> 07:53:48,140
I went in.

13349
07:53:48,200 --> 07:53:48,860
I went in.

13350
07:53:51,660 --> 07:53:52,620
Oh my god.

13351
07:53:52,700 --> 07:53:53,200
We have ten!

13352
07:53:53,280 --> 07:53:53,760
We have ten!

13353
07:53:53,820 --> 07:53:54,300
I have ten!

13354
07:53:54,380 --> 07:53:54,860
I have ten!

13355
07:53:55,460 --> 07:53:56,280
We made it!

13356
07:53:56,840 --> 07:53:57,460
Get this guy!

13357
07:53:59,540 --> 07:54:02,500
Okay, I think we can leave then, right?

13358
07:54:03,120 --> 07:54:04,280
I made an escape route.

13359
07:54:10,040 --> 07:54:11,620
Do you have enough food?

13360
07:54:11,880 --> 07:54:12,240
Are you good?

13361
07:54:12,880 --> 07:54:13,660
Yeah, I'm good.

13362
07:54:14,940 --> 07:54:15,800
Oh my god.

13363
07:54:16,120 --> 07:54:17,760
Now we go home.

13364
07:54:22,260 --> 07:54:23,300
Going home!

13365
07:54:25,740 --> 07:54:27,400
Alright, do you have obsidian?

13366
07:54:27,400 --> 07:54:29,920
I have two obsidian!

13367
07:54:33,980 --> 07:54:36,820
Alright, time to walk over.

13368
07:54:38,280 --> 07:54:40,280
Wait, is it really ten is enough?

13369
07:54:42,540 --> 07:54:43,420
We have thirteen.

13370
07:54:43,700 --> 07:54:44,840
With you, we have thirteen.

13371
07:54:45,060 --> 07:54:45,240
Oh, okay.

13372
07:54:45,720 --> 07:54:47,120
I'm going to give you my other three.

13373
07:54:47,280 --> 07:54:47,660
There we go.

13374
07:54:47,760 --> 07:54:48,740
We'll just keep them all together.

13375
07:54:51,200 --> 07:54:52,140
Ten is minimal.

13376
07:54:53,240 --> 07:54:54,380
We have thirteen.

13377
07:54:54,860 --> 07:54:55,520
We have thirteen.

13378
07:54:55,780 --> 07:54:56,140
That's good.

13379
07:54:56,200 --> 07:54:56,500
That's good.

13380
07:54:56,500 --> 07:54:57,500
Thirteen is good.

13381
07:54:57,600 --> 07:55:00,880
People were saying fourteen is like the absolute safe, so thirteen is good.

13382
07:55:03,200 --> 07:55:03,920
Watch out!

13383
07:55:04,080 --> 07:55:04,200
Watch out!

13384
07:55:04,340 --> 07:55:04,520
Watch out!

13385
07:55:06,840 --> 07:55:08,340
What are you looking at?

13386
07:55:08,440 --> 07:55:09,640
Why are you wearing a gold...

13387
07:55:10,420 --> 07:55:11,860
Because my helmet is broken!

13388
07:55:12,020 --> 07:55:13,840
I don't want to get beat up by the pigs!

13389
07:55:14,080 --> 07:55:14,180
No!

13390
07:55:14,460 --> 07:55:16,160
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

13391
07:55:16,260 --> 07:55:16,740
I got you.

13392
07:55:17,440 --> 07:55:18,860
Okay, how do we get out of here?

13393
07:55:19,040 --> 07:55:20,780
There's a gold chestplate if you need this.

13394
07:55:20,980 --> 07:55:21,380
Oh, okay.

13395
07:55:21,400 --> 07:55:21,940
I'll take it.

13396
07:55:22,320 --> 07:55:23,740
Just in case your helmet breaks.

13397
07:55:26,560 --> 07:55:28,080
Oh my god, it's almost dead.

13398
07:55:31,260 --> 07:55:33,560
Alright, how do we go home?

13399
07:55:34,740 --> 07:55:36,160
How do we get out of here?

13400
07:55:36,160 --> 07:55:38,120
What would be the easiest way?

13401
07:55:39,900 --> 07:55:41,740
We traveled very far.

13402
07:55:41,820 --> 07:55:42,520
Very far.

13403
07:55:43,040 --> 07:55:46,300
Let's just get out of the fortress first so that we don't die.

13404
07:55:46,320 --> 07:55:47,620
Someone said trade for more obsidian.

13405
07:55:49,760 --> 07:55:50,600
We should.

13406
07:55:50,880 --> 07:55:53,660
I left my crafting table, so I gotta make another one.

13407
07:55:54,120 --> 07:55:54,920
Oh, I can make one.

13408
07:55:54,920 --> 07:55:56,500
I just made it.

13409
07:55:56,540 --> 07:55:57,160
Okay, nevermind.

13410
07:55:57,620 --> 07:55:59,740
Okay, so I'm gonna make the...

13411
07:55:59,740 --> 07:56:02,220
I'm watching out for any guys to attack.

13412
07:56:03,440 --> 07:56:05,340
Alright, do you have any nuggies or no?

13413
07:56:05,860 --> 07:56:06,720
No nuggies.

13414
07:56:07,220 --> 07:56:10,700
Alright, so I have... I have 16 gold for obsidian.

13415
07:56:11,100 --> 07:56:12,240
How many obsidian do we need?

13416
07:56:12,880 --> 07:56:13,620
We need 10.

13417
07:56:14,040 --> 07:56:14,400
We have...

13418
07:56:14,400 --> 07:56:15,480
Okay, we have 4.

13419
07:56:15,780 --> 07:56:16,480
Yeah, we have 4.

13420
07:56:16,600 --> 07:56:18,020
Give me your obsidian.

13421
07:56:18,460 --> 07:56:18,800
Okay.

13422
07:56:20,680 --> 07:56:21,420
That's fine.

13423
07:56:21,640 --> 07:56:22,600
We're so paranoid.

13424
07:56:22,780 --> 07:56:23,100
I know.

13425
07:56:23,100 --> 07:56:25,860
We are paranoid.

13426
07:56:28,120 --> 07:56:30,160
Alright, we gotta figure out... How do we get here?

13427
07:56:30,480 --> 07:56:31,260
Okay, now we just have to...

13428
07:56:31,260 --> 07:56:32,100
We gotta go back to...

13429
07:56:32,100 --> 07:56:33,620
How do we... How did we get in here?

13430
07:56:33,960 --> 07:56:34,740
How did we get here?

13431
07:56:39,240 --> 07:56:40,520
Did you go down here?

13432
07:56:41,840 --> 07:56:43,140
I didn't open that up.

13433
07:56:43,240 --> 07:56:43,800
No, I did.

13434
07:56:43,860 --> 07:56:44,200
I did.

13435
07:56:44,280 --> 07:56:47,040
We gotta find the other assault place.

13436
07:56:51,390 --> 07:56:51,690
No.

13437
07:56:52,190 --> 07:56:53,330
No, not here.

13438
07:56:53,330 --> 07:56:53,370
Not here.

13439
07:56:54,930 --> 07:56:55,910
Oh my god.

13440
07:56:56,370 --> 07:56:57,310
Oh my god.

13441
07:56:57,430 --> 07:56:58,630
I can't believe we did it.

13442
07:56:59,210 --> 07:57:00,330
We actually did it.

13443
07:57:00,330 --> 07:57:01,010
We actually did it.

13444
07:57:01,010 --> 07:57:01,870
We didn't get one guide.

13445
07:57:02,150 --> 07:57:02,590
I know.

13446
07:57:03,010 --> 07:57:06,250
I can't believe there's a horrible realis right here in the kitchen.

13447
07:57:08,910 --> 07:57:10,190
It was right here.

13448
07:57:10,430 --> 07:57:12,370
It was actually right here.

13449
07:57:18,470 --> 07:57:19,370
Oh my god.

13450
07:57:19,550 --> 07:57:21,390
I have such a bad stomachache right now.

13451
07:57:21,530 --> 07:57:22,310
I'm gonna...

13452
07:57:22,870 --> 07:57:25,190
I'm gonna puke up all my mac and cheese.

13453
07:57:26,010 --> 07:57:27,530
From the stress?

13454
07:57:28,310 --> 07:57:29,890
Yeah, from the stress of it all.

13455
07:57:31,450 --> 07:57:34,350
How did we get out in here?

13456
07:57:34,990 --> 07:57:36,450
How did we get here?

13457
07:57:36,690 --> 07:57:38,390
I don't understand.

13458
07:57:40,690 --> 07:57:41,810
Oh, is it here?

13459
07:57:42,530 --> 07:57:42,770
Where?

13460
07:57:42,830 --> 07:57:45,070
No, I'm just seeing things.

13461
07:57:45,250 --> 07:57:45,830
I'm just...

13462
07:57:45,830 --> 07:57:47,690
Watch out for Wither Skelly.

13463
07:57:48,030 --> 07:57:48,870
I'm just...

13464
07:57:48,870 --> 07:57:50,070
I'm just...

13465
07:57:50,070 --> 07:57:52,370
I'm just seeing things now.

13466
07:57:52,470 --> 07:57:53,630
I don't know anymore.

13467
07:57:53,630 --> 07:57:55,130
Everything looks the same.

13468
07:57:55,330 --> 07:57:55,730
Every...

13469
07:57:55,730 --> 07:57:56,810
How did we get in here?

13470
07:57:57,130 --> 07:57:58,450
I don't know.

13471
07:57:58,910 --> 07:57:59,410
I don't know.

13472
07:57:59,410 --> 07:58:00,530
We came from the top of the fortress.

13473
07:58:00,730 --> 07:58:02,270
Yeah, so up here.

13474
07:58:02,430 --> 07:58:03,710
But there was like other...

13475
07:58:03,710 --> 07:58:04,170
Oh shit.

13476
07:58:04,450 --> 07:58:05,810
Wait, here, here, here, here.

13477
07:58:05,910 --> 07:58:06,290
Hold on.

13478
07:58:06,370 --> 07:58:07,070
I found it, I found it.

13479
07:58:07,330 --> 07:58:07,890
Okay, hold on.

13480
07:58:07,970 --> 07:58:08,310
I got it.

13481
07:58:08,350 --> 07:58:08,710
Where?

13482
07:58:08,970 --> 07:58:09,150
Where?

13483
07:58:09,970 --> 07:58:10,370
Downstairs?

13484
07:58:10,470 --> 07:58:11,010
I found it.

13485
07:58:11,870 --> 07:58:12,670
Follow my...

13486
07:58:12,670 --> 07:58:13,970
Look at my name tag.

13487
07:58:14,110 --> 07:58:14,750
I don't see it.

13488
07:58:14,790 --> 07:58:15,350
Everything is...

13489
07:58:15,350 --> 07:58:16,830
Right here, right here, right here.

13490
07:58:20,410 --> 07:58:21,410
Oh my gosh.

13491
07:58:21,570 --> 07:58:21,970
What was that?

13492
07:58:21,970 --> 07:58:22,950
It's here, it's here.

13493
07:58:23,050 --> 07:58:23,210
Okay.

13494
07:58:24,250 --> 07:58:25,250
Oh, yeah, yeah.

13495
07:58:25,270 --> 07:58:25,870
We dug that.

13496
07:58:25,970 --> 07:58:26,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13497
07:58:26,950 --> 07:58:27,690
Okay, good, good, good.

13498
07:58:35,930 --> 07:58:36,990
Oh, we came from above.

13499
07:58:37,050 --> 07:58:38,090
We came up from above, remember?

13500
07:58:38,330 --> 07:58:40,070
Yeah, but there was an area that we dropped in.

13501
07:58:40,070 --> 07:58:41,170
Right here, no, right here, right here.

13502
07:58:41,170 --> 07:58:42,770
Yeah, yeah, I built ourselves a stairs.

13503
07:58:43,110 --> 07:58:43,390
Okay.

13504
07:58:44,350 --> 07:58:44,950
Kind of.

13505
07:58:45,050 --> 07:58:46,810
Well, I was in the process of doing it.

13506
07:58:46,890 --> 07:58:47,290
Hold on.

13507
07:58:47,810 --> 07:58:48,530
Great stairs.

13508
07:58:48,790 --> 07:58:49,110
Thanks.

13509
07:58:49,690 --> 07:58:50,170
There we go.

13510
07:58:50,970 --> 07:58:54,230
They actually do work if you, you know...

13511
07:58:54,230 --> 07:58:56,370
You, you know, not use it as a staircase.

13512
07:58:56,370 --> 07:58:57,430
It's a staircase.

13513
07:58:57,430 --> 07:58:58,790
I literally just used it.

13514
07:58:58,790 --> 07:58:58,910
No, it's not.

13515
07:58:58,910 --> 07:58:59,570
It's not a staircase.

13516
07:58:59,670 --> 07:59:00,610
I literally just used it.

13517
07:59:00,690 --> 07:59:02,730
There was one block that I couldn't go up from.

13518
07:59:02,750 --> 07:59:05,110
Hey, we wouldn't have found this thing if it wasn't for me, okay?

13519
07:59:05,210 --> 07:59:07,650
So, you know, give me some, cut me some slack.

13520
07:59:12,110 --> 07:59:13,410
Oh, I hear a ghast.

13521
07:59:14,530 --> 07:59:15,210
I'm scared.

13522
07:59:15,850 --> 07:59:16,230
I'm scared.

13523
07:59:16,230 --> 07:59:16,650
I'm scared.

13524
07:59:16,930 --> 07:59:19,130
We just have to get to an area with...

13525
07:59:19,870 --> 07:59:20,510
Oh, shit.

13526
07:59:20,730 --> 07:59:21,790
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

13527
07:59:22,110 --> 07:59:22,730
Go, go, go, go.

13528
07:59:22,770 --> 07:59:23,010
Is that ghast?

13529
07:59:23,090 --> 07:59:23,470
Is that ghast?

13530
07:59:23,570 --> 07:59:24,190
Yes, yes, yes.

13531
07:59:24,550 --> 07:59:25,290
Oh my god.

13532
07:59:25,750 --> 07:59:26,630
And you have no arrows?

13533
07:59:26,630 --> 07:59:27,510
I have no arrows?

13534
07:59:27,630 --> 07:59:27,970
Oh my god.

13535
07:59:27,970 --> 07:59:28,690
I have no arrows.

13536
07:59:28,870 --> 07:59:30,270
I have two bones.

13537
07:59:30,830 --> 07:59:31,510
Oh, shit.

13538
07:59:33,370 --> 07:59:35,150
We gotta go through the forest.

13539
07:59:35,750 --> 07:59:36,270
That's okay.

13540
07:59:36,590 --> 07:59:37,450
The forest is fine.

13541
07:59:37,650 --> 07:59:38,350
It's just Enderman.

13542
07:59:38,410 --> 07:59:39,470
We gotta...

13543
07:59:40,450 --> 07:59:41,250
We gotta...

13544
07:59:41,250 --> 07:59:42,710
We gotta do it.

13545
07:59:42,990 --> 07:59:43,810
I have one arrow?

13546
07:59:44,310 --> 07:59:45,230
Oh, I do have an arrow.

13547
07:59:45,490 --> 07:59:46,110
Where did this come from?

13548
07:59:46,250 --> 07:59:47,210
Yeah, but it takes two arrows.

13549
07:59:47,330 --> 07:59:48,770
It takes two arrows to kill him.

13550
07:59:49,050 --> 07:59:49,670
Oh, yeah.

13551
07:59:53,930 --> 07:59:54,730
Okay, um...

13552
07:59:54,730 --> 07:59:55,850
How can we get over there?

13553
07:59:55,850 --> 07:59:57,610
There's so many Endermen.

13554
07:59:57,790 --> 07:59:58,950
Watch out for blazes.

13555
08:00:00,130 --> 08:00:02,050
The blazes are really far.

13556
08:00:02,770 --> 08:00:04,830
They shoot from everywhere.

13557
08:00:05,050 --> 08:00:05,490
It's crazy.

13558
08:00:07,490 --> 08:00:09,390
Is the ghast still there?

13559
08:00:10,090 --> 08:00:11,050
I don't see him.

13560
08:00:11,910 --> 08:00:12,550
Can we do it?

13561
08:00:12,790 --> 08:00:13,790
Do we need to despawn?

13562
08:00:14,390 --> 08:00:14,650
Maybe.

13563
08:00:17,030 --> 08:00:17,550
Parkour.

13564
08:00:17,770 --> 08:00:18,510
Oh, shit.

13565
08:00:18,830 --> 08:00:19,570
Ah, shit.

13566
08:00:21,450 --> 08:00:22,710
I'm in trouble.

13567
08:00:23,510 --> 08:00:24,410
I'm in trouble.

13568
08:00:24,410 --> 08:00:24,970
I'm in trouble.

13569
08:00:25,130 --> 08:00:25,390
I'm in trouble.

13570
08:00:28,130 --> 08:00:29,190
Make a wall.

13571
08:00:29,310 --> 08:00:29,610
I did.

13572
08:00:29,690 --> 08:00:30,030
I did.

13573
08:00:30,130 --> 08:00:30,810
I made a wall.

13574
08:00:30,890 --> 08:00:31,570
Make a wall.

13575
08:00:31,690 --> 08:00:33,410
I'm making a wall, Maya, too.

13576
08:00:33,570 --> 08:00:34,270
Make a wall.

13577
08:00:34,830 --> 08:00:35,790
I ran out.

13578
08:00:36,490 --> 08:00:37,050
Make a wall.

13579
08:00:37,050 --> 08:00:37,910
I'm a little stuck.

13580
08:00:37,910 --> 08:00:38,570
Keep making walls.

13581
08:00:38,590 --> 08:00:39,510
I'm a little stuck.

13582
08:00:40,250 --> 08:00:41,230
Keep making walls.

13583
08:00:41,250 --> 08:00:42,050
I'm almost...

13584
08:00:42,050 --> 08:00:42,970
Okay, I have cobblestone.

13585
08:00:43,110 --> 08:00:43,410
Okay, okay.

13586
08:00:43,650 --> 08:00:45,330
I'm making walls for us.

13587
08:00:46,590 --> 08:00:47,150
Where are you?

13588
08:00:47,170 --> 08:00:47,590
I can't hear.

13589
08:00:47,870 --> 08:00:48,570
Where are you?

13590
08:00:49,090 --> 08:00:49,670
Oh, I see you.

13591
08:00:52,810 --> 08:00:53,610
Flying higher.

13592
08:00:53,610 --> 08:00:54,750
They're flying higher.

13593
08:00:57,390 --> 08:00:57,870
Okay.

13594
08:00:59,050 --> 08:01:00,330
Alright, I've made a wall.

13595
08:01:01,050 --> 08:01:02,550
Come down here when you can.

13596
08:01:03,590 --> 08:01:04,330
Come down?

13597
08:01:04,870 --> 08:01:06,810
Yeah, we have to get to the forest.

13598
08:01:08,870 --> 08:01:10,010
We have to get down.

13599
08:01:12,230 --> 08:01:12,970
Oh, my God.

13600
08:01:13,630 --> 08:01:14,490
Why are you shooting?

13601
08:01:14,710 --> 08:01:15,690
Who can you even see?

13602
08:01:16,290 --> 08:01:16,690
Me.

13603
08:01:17,050 --> 08:01:17,530
Me.

13604
08:01:17,910 --> 08:01:18,830
That's who.

13605
08:01:18,970 --> 08:01:19,830
Okay, well, come down.

13606
08:01:19,950 --> 08:01:20,190
Come down.

13607
08:01:23,610 --> 08:01:23,790
Okay.

13608
08:01:24,210 --> 08:01:25,030
I'm making walls.

13609
08:01:25,030 --> 08:01:26,070
Who can you even see?

13610
08:01:26,250 --> 08:01:28,110
I'm literally behind you.

13611
08:01:28,210 --> 08:01:28,670
Hold on.

13612
08:01:28,770 --> 08:01:29,470
I thought you were...

13613
08:01:29,470 --> 08:01:30,490
I thought you were...

13614
08:01:30,490 --> 08:01:31,490
I thought you were covered.

13615
08:01:32,890 --> 08:01:36,510
Okay, I'm almost really out of everything that I have.

13616
08:01:36,750 --> 08:01:39,110
I'm thinking I'm stealing stuff I had.

13617
08:01:42,510 --> 08:01:43,450
Oh, don't look.

13618
08:01:43,510 --> 08:01:44,390
Don't look at them.

13619
08:01:44,530 --> 08:01:45,210
Don't look at them.

13620
08:01:45,270 --> 08:01:46,710
Because we ran out of stone.

13621
08:01:46,870 --> 08:01:47,770
We ran out of stone.

13622
08:01:47,910 --> 08:01:48,130
So don't look at them.

13623
08:01:48,130 --> 08:01:49,010
No, I still have a little bit of stone.

13624
08:01:49,110 --> 08:01:49,870
I still have a little bit of stone.

13625
08:01:50,270 --> 08:01:51,910
Yes, but we...

13626
08:01:51,910 --> 08:01:53,390
Their Endermen are right below us.

13627
08:01:53,390 --> 08:01:53,730
I know.

13628
08:01:53,730 --> 08:01:56,010
Their Endermen are right below us, so don't look at them.

13629
08:01:57,990 --> 08:01:58,490
Oh shit.

13630
08:01:59,370 --> 08:01:59,990
Here you go.

13631
08:02:00,010 --> 08:02:00,850
We're not safe.

13632
08:02:00,990 --> 08:02:01,370
No, we're not.

13633
08:02:02,010 --> 08:02:04,890
Thank you, but we're not safe from the blazes.

13634
08:02:05,610 --> 08:02:06,310
Oh no.

13635
08:02:09,350 --> 08:02:10,910
Please despawn blazes.

13636
08:02:11,670 --> 08:02:12,130
How are we supposed...

13637
08:02:12,130 --> 08:02:13,150
Okay, I think...

13638
08:02:13,150 --> 08:02:14,090
Oh gosh.

13639
08:02:15,070 --> 08:02:16,460
I think we might have to like...

13640
08:02:17,610 --> 08:02:20,430
Jump and just run into the forest.

13641
08:02:20,770 --> 08:02:22,410
And then dig into the wall.

13642
08:02:22,830 --> 08:02:23,230
Okay.

13643
08:02:24,370 --> 08:02:24,770
Okay.

13644
08:02:24,930 --> 08:02:25,930
This is how we die.

13645
08:02:26,250 --> 08:02:27,010
This is how we die.

13646
08:02:27,010 --> 08:02:27,990
Wait, have your pickaxe...

13647
08:02:27,990 --> 08:02:28,790
Well, I have mine ready.

13648
08:02:29,330 --> 08:02:29,830
Have your...

13649
08:02:29,830 --> 08:02:30,710
Have your everything ready.

13650
08:02:31,030 --> 08:02:32,010
Okay, I'm gonna eat real quick.

13651
08:02:32,210 --> 08:02:33,110
Yeah, sword or pickaxe?

13652
08:02:33,190 --> 08:02:34,070
Sword or pickaxe?

13653
08:02:35,690 --> 08:02:36,490
Pickaxe probably.

13654
08:02:36,890 --> 08:02:38,010
Because who are we fighting?

13655
08:02:39,010 --> 08:02:39,810
The Endermen?

13656
08:02:39,890 --> 08:02:40,450
I don't know.

13657
08:02:40,570 --> 08:02:41,950
What if we accidentally look at them?

13658
08:02:42,070 --> 08:02:42,570
Okay, true.

13659
08:02:42,950 --> 08:02:43,830
Alright, I'm gonna go down.

13660
08:02:44,310 --> 08:02:45,910
Okay, we're safe for now.

13661
08:02:46,150 --> 08:02:46,730
Alright, let's go.

13662
08:02:47,410 --> 08:02:48,210
Go, go, go, go, go.

13663
08:02:48,370 --> 08:02:48,950
Just run.

13664
08:02:49,350 --> 08:02:49,870
Just run.

13665
08:02:50,330 --> 08:02:50,770
Just run.

13666
08:02:51,330 --> 08:02:52,250
Be careful here.

13667
08:02:52,350 --> 08:02:53,090
There's a huge hole.

13668
08:02:53,390 --> 08:02:54,390
There's a huge hole right here.

13669
08:02:54,810 --> 08:02:55,290
Oh my gosh.

13670
08:02:55,410 --> 08:02:55,710
Just run.

13671
08:02:56,150 --> 08:02:56,430
Just run.

13672
08:02:56,730 --> 08:02:57,190
Just run.

13673
08:02:57,970 --> 08:02:58,510
Just run.

13674
08:02:58,870 --> 08:02:59,190
Just run.

13675
08:02:59,610 --> 08:03:00,130
Just run.

13676
08:03:01,190 --> 08:03:01,990
Just run.

13677
08:03:02,110 --> 08:03:02,450
Just run.

13678
08:03:02,690 --> 08:03:03,070
Just run.

13679
08:03:03,230 --> 08:03:03,650
Just run.

13680
08:03:03,870 --> 08:03:04,450
Just run.

13681
08:03:05,670 --> 08:03:07,510
Okay, I think we're safe from the blazes though.

13682
08:03:08,050 --> 08:03:08,250
Okay.

13683
08:03:13,360 --> 08:03:14,980
Oh my god.

13684
08:03:18,280 --> 08:03:19,060
Oh my...

13685
08:03:19,060 --> 08:03:20,740
We gotta find the pigs.

13686
08:03:20,860 --> 08:03:22,080
We gotta get back to pigs.

13687
08:03:22,080 --> 08:03:22,760
Pig territory.

13688
08:03:23,060 --> 08:03:23,460
We gotta get...

13689
08:03:23,460 --> 08:03:24,920
We gotta get back to the...

13690
08:03:24,920 --> 08:03:25,140
Wait!

13691
08:03:25,400 --> 08:03:27,280
The red area is where we came from.

13692
08:03:27,640 --> 08:03:28,320
Oh shoot.

13693
08:03:28,680 --> 08:03:29,080
But it was the ghast...

13694
08:03:29,080 --> 08:03:29,660
We can't, we can't.

13695
08:03:29,760 --> 08:03:30,360
There's ghast.

13696
08:03:30,500 --> 08:03:31,540
The ghast blocked us.

13697
08:03:31,540 --> 08:03:32,440
We can't...

13698
08:03:32,440 --> 08:03:34,260
We gotta find our own red area.

13699
08:03:34,720 --> 08:03:38,940
Let's just dig through here and we can dig to the right and we might make it back into that area.

13700
08:03:42,520 --> 08:03:45,780
Took us three hours to find a fortress.

13701
08:03:47,520 --> 08:03:48,320
Oh my god.

13702
08:03:49,080 --> 08:03:51,720
Oh, thank you.

13703
08:03:52,940 --> 08:03:55,220
I thought for a second that I was about to be like...

13704
08:03:55,220 --> 08:03:56,720
Wait, you didn't just dig and like get...

13705
08:03:56,720 --> 08:03:57,920
Get lava?

13706
08:03:59,640 --> 08:04:00,660
This is good though.

13707
08:04:00,840 --> 08:04:02,080
We're replenishing our...

13708
08:04:03,060 --> 08:04:03,660
That's good.

13709
08:04:03,740 --> 08:04:05,200
We're replenishing our...

13710
08:04:06,560 --> 08:04:07,900
Are you digging?

13711
08:04:08,440 --> 08:04:10,940
No, there's like literally holes underneath you.

13712
08:04:11,240 --> 08:04:13,480
There's holes underneath you.

13713
08:04:13,680 --> 08:04:14,860
Alright, I'm gonna dig here.

13714
08:04:15,040 --> 08:04:15,620
Watch out, watch out.

13715
08:04:16,940 --> 08:04:17,400
Okay.

13716
08:04:20,200 --> 08:04:21,140
Believe in you.

13717
08:04:22,080 --> 08:04:23,920
I won't dig to the side cause...

13718
08:04:23,920 --> 08:04:25,060
Yeah, don't dig.

13719
08:04:25,280 --> 08:04:26,400
Just let me dig.

13720
08:04:27,380 --> 08:04:28,520
Just let me dig.

13721
08:04:28,980 --> 08:04:30,440
I'll dig us out of here.

13722
08:04:30,900 --> 08:04:32,300
And we'll go to the red hopefully.

13723
08:04:33,000 --> 08:04:34,480
I'm gonna make some bread.

13724
08:04:35,260 --> 08:04:36,200
And then we just...

13725
08:04:36,200 --> 08:04:37,600
Then we will be out.

13726
08:04:37,700 --> 08:04:38,200
Oh my gosh.

13727
08:04:38,640 --> 08:04:40,040
Imagine we'll see sunlight.

13728
08:04:40,720 --> 08:04:41,380
Oh my god.

13729
08:04:41,460 --> 08:04:43,300
And then we never have to go there again.

13730
08:04:44,220 --> 08:04:45,100
Don't say that.

13731
08:04:45,260 --> 08:04:46,360
Do not say that.

13732
08:04:47,140 --> 08:04:48,420
Do not say that.

13733
08:04:48,720 --> 08:04:51,100
If we have the worst luck ever...

13734
08:04:51,100 --> 08:04:53,440
If we have the worst luck ever...

13735
08:04:53,440 --> 08:04:55,700
We'll never have to go there again.

13736
08:05:00,260 --> 08:05:00,980
It's okay.

13737
08:05:01,180 --> 08:05:02,520
I have my diamond.

13738
08:05:03,780 --> 08:05:04,340
Unless...

13739
08:05:05,880 --> 08:05:06,440
Unless...

13740
08:05:08,160 --> 08:05:08,720
Unless...

13741
08:05:08,720 --> 08:05:10,100
Don't be so funny.

13742
08:05:10,240 --> 08:05:11,360
Something just happened.

13743
08:05:11,700 --> 08:05:14,100
I bet Chat is feeling so much more...

13744
08:05:15,320 --> 08:05:17,140
Like confident in us now though.

13745
08:05:17,140 --> 08:05:18,480
We have to make arrows.

13746
08:05:18,960 --> 08:05:22,500
We can make arrows with regular materials.

13747
08:05:23,380 --> 08:05:24,340
Yeah, but we need...

13748
08:05:24,340 --> 08:05:24,880
What do we need?

13749
08:05:25,500 --> 08:05:26,560
We don't have string.

13750
08:05:27,580 --> 08:05:27,980
What?

13751
08:05:28,680 --> 08:05:30,240
Wait, don't you need string for arrows?

13752
08:05:30,320 --> 08:05:31,500
I have 32 string.

13753
08:05:32,000 --> 08:05:32,400
Oh, okay.

13754
08:05:32,460 --> 08:05:32,860
We're fine.

13755
08:05:36,260 --> 08:05:37,060
We're fine.

13756
08:05:37,180 --> 08:05:37,680
Oh my god.

13757
08:05:37,680 --> 08:05:39,220
We can create lots of beds.

13758
08:05:39,720 --> 08:05:41,060
Yeah, we can do the bed strut.

13759
08:05:41,660 --> 08:05:41,960
Yeah.

13760
08:05:42,300 --> 08:05:43,240
Flint, stick, and feather.

13761
08:05:43,480 --> 08:05:44,800
Yeah, we don't even need string.

13762
08:05:45,000 --> 08:05:46,960
We need strings for bows, but not for arrows.

13763
08:05:46,960 --> 08:05:48,240
Watch out!

13764
08:05:49,400 --> 08:05:51,680
I'm literally 20 feet away from you.

13765
08:05:52,560 --> 08:05:53,440
Of course you are.

13766
08:05:54,240 --> 08:05:55,160
Of course you are.

13767
08:05:59,060 --> 08:06:00,680
Of course you are.

13768
08:06:00,960 --> 08:06:04,400
You're ticking with lava.

13769
08:06:10,060 --> 08:06:10,520
Are you okay?

13770
08:06:10,820 --> 08:06:11,500
I'm taking sippy.

13771
08:06:12,660 --> 08:06:13,480
What the hell was that?

13772
08:06:14,280 --> 08:06:15,260
I don't fucking know.

13773
08:06:16,340 --> 08:06:17,760
Oh, that's the Enderman to our left.

13774
08:06:17,760 --> 08:06:19,940
No, but like something screamed.

13775
08:06:21,320 --> 08:06:22,100
Enderman whoops?

13776
08:06:22,480 --> 08:06:23,520
Is that what they're called?

13777
08:06:23,640 --> 08:06:24,920
Enderman be whoops?

13778
08:06:25,280 --> 08:06:27,520
What is that?

13779
08:06:27,980 --> 08:06:32,080
That has to be a gas, right?

13780
08:06:33,380 --> 08:06:35,880
It's not showing up on my thing as a gas.

13781
08:06:37,280 --> 08:06:38,380
I have no idea.

13782
08:06:38,780 --> 08:06:40,380
I don't know what that was.

13783
08:06:40,400 --> 08:06:41,060
That was weird.

13784
08:06:41,360 --> 08:06:42,220
I didn't hear it.

13785
08:06:42,720 --> 08:06:44,000
How long is this mountain?

13786
08:06:44,800 --> 08:06:46,440
Oh, I spoke too soon?

13787
08:06:47,600 --> 08:06:49,740
We're still in the... Oh my god.

13788
08:06:51,420 --> 08:06:56,280
I don't like that sound that you just heard because we ran out of bows and arrows.

13789
08:06:56,800 --> 08:07:00,960
Yeah, we have to not encounter that guy.

13790
08:07:02,460 --> 08:07:04,000
We're like deep in the forest.

13791
08:07:04,140 --> 08:07:07,120
I think this didn't work.

13792
08:07:08,380 --> 08:07:12,620
I think the red area is to our right.

13793
08:07:14,200 --> 08:07:15,480
To the right?

13794
08:07:15,480 --> 08:07:16,440
You want to dig?

13795
08:07:28,140 --> 08:07:29,380
Follow the cords.

13796
08:07:29,520 --> 08:07:30,040
What cords?

13797
08:07:30,120 --> 08:07:31,040
We didn't take cords.

13798
08:07:32,780 --> 08:07:34,540
The coordinates back to our original...

13799
08:07:35,240 --> 08:07:37,800
Our very first portal.

13800
08:07:38,100 --> 08:07:40,860
The one that's a hundred miles away from us.

13801
08:07:41,340 --> 08:07:41,940
Is it this?

13802
08:07:41,980 --> 08:07:43,920
A little tiny spot right here?

13803
08:07:44,500 --> 08:07:46,660
Oh, I guess we were really close to the...

13804
08:07:48,320 --> 08:07:49,240
Oh, hello.

13805
08:07:49,720 --> 08:07:51,660
We were really close to the...

13806
08:07:51,660 --> 08:07:52,400
What's it called?

13807
08:07:53,500 --> 08:07:55,700
Yeah, but then there's that big forest that we came from.

13808
08:07:55,880 --> 08:07:56,680
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

13809
08:07:56,740 --> 08:08:01,320
We were really close to a forest when we got to just a little regular guy area.

13810
08:08:01,860 --> 08:08:04,160
Wait, what was our coordinates for our original place?

13811
08:08:04,880 --> 08:08:05,800
The original portal?

13812
08:08:06,280 --> 08:08:07,500
Yeah, yeah, original portal.

13813
08:08:08,160 --> 08:08:09,220
Hold on, I have to...

13814
08:08:09,220 --> 08:08:10,560
I want to see how far we are from it.

13815
08:08:10,580 --> 08:08:10,880
Wait, there's a piglin!

13816
08:08:12,020 --> 08:08:12,820
Piglin snorting?

13817
08:08:13,100 --> 08:08:13,580
Where at?

13818
08:08:13,740 --> 08:08:15,060
Where are you piglin snorting?

13819
08:08:17,020 --> 08:08:17,900
Can we go up?

13820
08:08:18,280 --> 08:08:19,220
He might be above us.

13821
08:08:19,920 --> 08:08:20,800
Yeah, I think he is.

13822
08:08:20,800 --> 08:08:23,160
You have all the... You gathered all the netherite, right?

13823
08:08:23,240 --> 08:08:24,300
So I don't have it.

13824
08:08:24,840 --> 08:08:26,460
Oh, here's a stack.

13825
08:08:26,580 --> 08:08:27,820
He's behind us, he's behind us.

13826
08:08:28,380 --> 08:08:29,740
Who's behind... Oh, hello.

13827
08:08:30,060 --> 08:08:31,320
Oh my god, Endy, hello.

13828
08:08:31,960 --> 08:08:32,600
Yeah, he's behind us.

13829
08:08:32,840 --> 08:08:35,200
Let me get the cords from the original one.

13830
08:08:38,520 --> 08:08:40,040
Okay, let me check.

13831
08:08:40,140 --> 08:08:42,080
Alright, are you ready to...

13832
08:08:42,080 --> 08:08:43,700
Yeah, what is it?

13833
08:08:45,920 --> 08:08:46,400
Um...

13834
08:08:46,400 --> 08:08:47,700
Are the... It's negative...

13835
08:08:48,700 --> 08:08:50,180
Two thousand... Oh, sorry, no.

13836
08:08:50,260 --> 08:08:53,460
Negative five hundred and five...

13837
08:08:54,320 --> 08:08:54,800
Uh...

13838
08:08:54,800 --> 08:08:56,320
One hundred ninety-five.

13839
08:08:56,860 --> 08:08:58,100
We're not making it back.

13840
08:08:58,440 --> 08:08:59,420
You wanna know what we are?

13841
08:08:59,620 --> 08:09:00,320
You know...

13842
08:09:00,320 --> 08:09:01,820
Oh, I'm looking at what we are.

13843
08:09:02,120 --> 08:09:03,480
Looking at what we are.

13844
08:09:06,360 --> 08:09:07,900
We're not getting back there.

13845
08:09:08,120 --> 08:09:08,920
We gotta say goodbye.

13846
08:09:09,360 --> 08:09:11,280
Oh, we traveled that far?

13847
08:09:11,280 --> 08:09:14,100
Say goodbye to that lapis block.

13848
08:09:14,300 --> 08:09:15,780
Say goodbye to...

13849
08:09:15,780 --> 08:09:16,860
I see a ghast.

13850
08:09:16,900 --> 08:09:18,600
I see a ghast floating over there.

13851
08:09:18,740 --> 08:09:19,540
Oh gosh, okay.

13852
08:09:20,800 --> 08:09:21,820
I guess we build up.

13853
08:09:22,120 --> 08:09:22,400
Build up.

13854
08:09:22,600 --> 08:09:23,720
We gotta just build up.

13855
08:09:27,920 --> 08:09:29,040
We traveled...

13856
08:09:29,040 --> 08:09:30,380
We are adventurers.

13857
08:09:30,380 --> 08:09:33,920
This is why the... This is why the earth isn't round.

13858
08:09:34,520 --> 08:09:37,080
Because in Minecraft, it's clearly flat.

13859
08:09:37,640 --> 08:09:38,560
Oh my god, please.

13860
08:09:40,140 --> 08:09:40,940
Do you hear him?

13861
08:09:41,500 --> 08:09:42,100
Yes, I do.

13862
08:09:42,140 --> 08:09:43,920
I'm trying to not look behind me.

13863
08:09:44,860 --> 08:09:47,400
If you come up here, there's like a safe little area.

13864
08:09:48,200 --> 08:09:50,180
Oh wait, we're in the mushroom area.

13865
08:09:50,600 --> 08:09:50,700
I know.

13866
08:09:50,860 --> 08:09:51,180
I know.

13867
08:09:51,320 --> 08:09:51,660
I know.

13868
08:09:52,020 --> 08:09:52,620
But come up here.

13869
08:09:52,720 --> 08:09:53,100
Come up here.

13870
08:09:53,240 --> 08:09:53,600
Come up here.

13871
08:09:53,620 --> 08:09:54,700
Where is here?

13872
08:09:54,900 --> 08:09:55,500
Where is here?

13873
08:09:55,500 --> 08:09:56,080
Where did you go?

13874
08:09:56,560 --> 08:09:57,520
I don't know.

13875
08:09:57,720 --> 08:09:59,500
I don't know anymore.

13876
08:10:00,240 --> 08:10:01,020
Oh, there you are.

13877
08:10:01,060 --> 08:10:01,840
Hey, I'm here.

13878
08:10:02,180 --> 08:10:02,620
Where are you?

13879
08:10:03,600 --> 08:10:04,880
Tokyo is a flat earth.

13880
08:10:06,420 --> 08:10:07,800
I almost looked at that guy.

13881
08:10:08,220 --> 08:10:09,060
Where are you?

13882
08:10:10,080 --> 08:10:10,800
Turn around.

13883
08:10:11,000 --> 08:10:11,460
Oh, hello.

13884
08:10:11,700 --> 08:10:12,120
Oh, okay.

13885
08:10:12,540 --> 08:10:14,620
I was gonna say in here is a safe little area.

13886
08:10:15,720 --> 08:10:17,920
Oh my gosh, what if we just set up shop and...

13887
08:10:17,920 --> 08:10:19,160
What if we just lived here forever?

13888
08:10:19,840 --> 08:10:20,740
This is where we live.

13889
08:10:20,820 --> 08:10:21,900
We're just never gonna end stream.

13890
08:10:22,000 --> 08:10:24,400
We're just gonna be here like domestic life right here.

13891
08:10:26,740 --> 08:10:28,880
Wait, the red is in front of us.

13892
08:10:28,920 --> 08:10:30,160
It's literally in front of us.

13893
08:10:31,680 --> 08:10:32,340
It is?

13894
08:10:35,120 --> 08:10:36,060
Oh yeah, you're right.

13895
08:10:36,140 --> 08:10:36,820
It is right there.

13896
08:10:36,820 --> 08:10:37,660
Okay, thank goodness.

13897
08:10:40,100 --> 08:10:44,520
We are putting all our gotcha luck into this right now.

13898
08:10:45,740 --> 08:10:47,620
Wait, how many pearls do we have?

13899
08:10:47,640 --> 08:10:48,900
Do we have enough enderpearls?

13900
08:10:49,100 --> 08:10:50,760
Okay, maybe you do gotcha.

13901
08:10:50,780 --> 08:10:51,560
We have to get back there.

13902
08:10:51,620 --> 08:10:53,920
We have to get back there because all their enderpearls are there.

13903
08:10:54,760 --> 08:10:56,480
Oh my god, are you serious?

13904
08:10:56,900 --> 08:10:58,440
All their enderpearls are there.

13905
08:10:58,580 --> 08:10:59,640
I didn't bring them.

13906
08:10:59,920 --> 08:11:02,300
I didn't bring the enderpearls.

13907
08:11:02,340 --> 08:11:04,180
I left them all there.

13908
08:11:04,880 --> 08:11:09,600
We have to, when we get out of here, we have to find our area.

13909
08:11:10,160 --> 08:11:11,880
We have to travel.

13910
08:11:12,860 --> 08:11:17,400
Okay, well, what if we don't do that and we just farm enderpearls right here?

13911
08:11:18,660 --> 08:11:20,140
I mean, you do you.

13912
08:11:20,220 --> 08:11:22,100
I'm gonna find a piglet and trade.

13913
08:11:22,180 --> 08:11:23,140
Well, yeah, keep trading.

13914
08:11:23,440 --> 08:11:24,420
We gotta get the...

13915
08:11:24,420 --> 08:11:25,800
We gotta get the...

13916
08:11:27,940 --> 08:11:31,380
I put it there because I thought we'd come back.

13917
08:11:31,380 --> 08:11:34,260
How far did you think we were gonna...

13918
08:11:34,260 --> 08:11:36,640
You thought we were just gonna go for a little brisk walk?

13919
08:11:36,760 --> 08:11:38,380
Like just a little...

13920
08:11:39,200 --> 08:11:40,560
Oh my god.

13921
08:11:40,900 --> 08:11:43,220
I didn't think we'd never come back.

13922
08:11:43,320 --> 08:11:45,660
I didn't think we'd never come back.

13923
08:11:46,060 --> 08:11:48,400
I thought we'd never come back.

13924
08:11:48,540 --> 08:11:49,600
I really did.

13925
08:11:50,040 --> 08:11:56,060
I thought we were just gonna travel there for a little bit and then we'd come back.

13926
08:11:56,300 --> 08:11:57,760
There's one more over there.

13927
08:11:57,880 --> 08:11:58,280
I got one.

13928
08:12:00,040 --> 08:12:00,740
Oh, he's looking at you.

13929
08:12:00,740 --> 08:12:01,300
Yeah, I got him.

13930
08:12:02,100 --> 08:12:03,300
Yeah, you keep trading.

13931
08:12:03,800 --> 08:12:04,500
You keep trading.

13932
08:12:09,200 --> 08:12:10,800
I'm carrying the brewing stand.

13933
08:12:10,920 --> 08:12:11,780
I have the brewing stand.

13934
08:12:13,380 --> 08:12:14,920
I have the brewing stand, guys.

13935
08:12:15,200 --> 08:12:15,600
Don't worry.

13936
08:12:16,180 --> 08:12:16,940
Blackstone again.

13937
08:12:17,240 --> 08:12:18,320
I have the brewing stand.

13938
08:12:18,880 --> 08:12:19,760
I brought it with me.

13939
08:12:20,660 --> 08:12:21,740
I thought ahead.

13940
08:12:24,400 --> 08:12:25,960
Is that also blackstone?

13941
08:12:26,480 --> 08:12:28,680
Wait, if he gives you obsidian, let me know.

13942
08:12:29,000 --> 08:12:29,620
I'll take it.

13943
08:12:29,620 --> 08:12:32,800
He keeps giving me, like, corrupted obsidian.

13944
08:12:33,980 --> 08:12:34,160
What?

13945
08:12:34,380 --> 08:12:38,500
What if you went above ground and traveled 20,000 blocks back to the portal in the overworld?

13946
08:12:39,980 --> 08:12:41,740
Well, that's where our stuff is.

13947
08:12:41,780 --> 08:12:42,020
Wait.

13948
08:12:42,980 --> 08:12:45,420
That's where we... That's what we did.

13949
08:12:46,160 --> 08:12:47,180
Wait, wait, I'm confused.

13950
08:12:48,920 --> 08:12:49,600
Oh no.

13951
08:12:51,000 --> 08:12:52,040
Above ground?

13952
08:12:52,320 --> 08:12:52,560
Huh?

13953
08:12:54,520 --> 08:12:56,100
It's like the world limit.

13954
08:12:56,720 --> 08:12:57,680
Oh, like...

13955
08:12:59,780 --> 08:13:00,180
Huh?

13956
08:13:02,620 --> 08:13:07,520
It's like you can go all the way up for the world limit thing.

13957
08:13:07,800 --> 08:13:10,520
Wait, like create a new portal and travel in the normal world.

13958
08:13:10,600 --> 08:13:11,340
That's what we're wanting to do.

13959
08:13:11,340 --> 08:13:13,220
That's what we're trying to do.

13960
08:13:13,960 --> 08:13:15,420
We're trying to figure it out.

13961
08:13:15,440 --> 08:13:16,360
We're trying to do that.

13962
08:13:17,780 --> 08:13:19,520
But we just don't have obsidian.

13963
08:13:20,040 --> 08:13:22,580
We just don't have obsidian.

13964
08:13:23,040 --> 08:13:24,520
Yeah, we're trying to collect the obsidian.

13965
08:13:24,520 --> 08:13:24,740
Obsidian!

13966
08:13:27,260 --> 08:13:29,220
I'm also just farming blocks.

13967
08:13:29,820 --> 08:13:32,680
I mean, I mean pearls, because it's, you know, we're...

13968
08:13:32,680 --> 08:13:35,980
Oh my god, my gacha luck is not doing so well.

13969
08:13:36,500 --> 08:13:39,480
Man, my gacha luck isn't doing so well.

13970
08:13:39,760 --> 08:13:42,080
I've got everything, but I have leather?

13971
08:13:42,420 --> 08:13:43,300
I have leather?

13972
08:13:43,720 --> 08:13:44,320
Wow!

13973
08:13:46,280 --> 08:13:47,380
Is that it?

13974
08:13:47,840 --> 08:13:49,040
Oh, I have one obsidian!

13975
08:13:49,240 --> 08:13:51,400
I got one obsidian!

13976
08:13:51,680 --> 08:13:52,860
We have five obsidian!

13977
08:13:54,520 --> 08:13:57,480
Okay, I can make... I can make another...

13978
08:13:57,480 --> 08:13:58,800
I can make more gold.

13979
08:14:00,320 --> 08:14:01,900
Hey, little Enderman!

13980
08:14:02,820 --> 08:14:04,480
I have five more gold.

13981
08:14:04,640 --> 08:14:06,580
I'm coming for you, Enderman.

13982
08:14:08,900 --> 08:14:12,060
Show me your sweet, sweet, slender body.

13983
08:14:12,180 --> 08:14:13,920
You have that, you're an Enderman.

13984
08:14:14,720 --> 08:14:18,420
Oh, come on, look at this, look at this, look at this juicy...

13985
08:14:18,420 --> 08:14:19,620
Juicy gold!

13986
08:14:20,820 --> 08:14:22,200
How much gold do you have?

13987
08:14:24,000 --> 08:14:26,960
I have... Here, take my axe, I don't need it anymore.

13988
08:14:27,160 --> 08:14:28,380
And my axe!

13989
08:14:28,740 --> 08:14:30,800
Take my axe, I don't even want it.

13990
08:14:32,140 --> 08:14:32,640
Okay.

13991
08:14:33,300 --> 08:14:34,380
Come on, take it.

13992
08:14:35,240 --> 08:14:36,760
The aether, what's that?

13993
08:14:40,360 --> 08:14:43,260
I heard a ghastly, I heard a ghastly, I got PTSD.

13994
08:14:43,680 --> 08:14:44,560
I know, I hear him too.

13995
08:14:45,120 --> 08:14:45,720
Just ignore.

13996
08:14:46,640 --> 08:14:48,680
Unless we see...

13997
08:14:48,680 --> 08:14:50,260
How many enderpearls do you have?

13998
08:14:50,520 --> 08:14:50,900
Two!

13999
08:14:51,900 --> 08:14:52,420
Okay.

14000
08:14:53,220 --> 08:14:56,320
I'm trying to... There's no Enderman around here.

14001
08:14:57,360 --> 08:14:58,680
Uh-oh, he sounds close.

14002
08:14:59,120 --> 08:14:59,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14003
08:14:59,900 --> 08:15:01,060
Okay, here's one.

14004
08:15:02,040 --> 08:15:02,680
Here's one what?

14005
08:15:02,980 --> 08:15:03,560
Oh, thank you.

14006
08:15:04,800 --> 08:15:06,040
I managed to get one.

14007
08:15:06,120 --> 08:15:07,380
Do you have any nuggets at all?

14008
08:15:08,180 --> 08:15:08,700
No.

14009
08:15:08,960 --> 08:15:10,040
No, I don't.

14010
08:15:10,460 --> 08:15:12,400
Okay, so...

14011
08:15:12,400 --> 08:15:14,200
Yeah, that's it.

14012
08:15:16,200 --> 08:15:17,600
We gotta farm more gold.

14013
08:15:17,600 --> 08:15:18,800
We gotta farm more gold.

14014
08:15:18,800 --> 08:15:21,000
We gotta find more gold.

14015
08:15:21,900 --> 08:15:24,240
There's some above us, there's...

14016
08:15:27,000 --> 08:15:28,860
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna trade my axe.

14017
08:15:29,260 --> 08:15:31,680
This is the last axe off the back of my...

14018
08:15:31,680 --> 08:15:33,260
You can trade your axe?

14019
08:15:33,680 --> 08:15:35,220
Yeah, you can trade gold items.

14020
08:15:35,460 --> 08:15:36,860
Where is the...

14021
08:15:36,860 --> 08:15:37,620
Seer, sir.

14022
08:15:37,880 --> 08:15:39,820
Is this all I have, sir?

14023
08:15:40,360 --> 08:15:42,140
This is... Please...

14024
08:15:42,140 --> 08:15:44,260
This is all I have.

14025
08:15:44,900 --> 08:15:47,160
Okay, hold on, I'm gonna look around for some gold.

14026
08:15:47,160 --> 08:15:49,520
I don't have any more.

14027
08:15:49,760 --> 08:15:52,560
This is everything I have.

14028
08:15:53,040 --> 08:15:54,120
What did he give me?

14029
08:15:56,040 --> 08:15:58,140
I don't know what he gave me.

14030
08:15:59,080 --> 08:16:01,180
But what did he take from you?

14031
08:16:01,600 --> 08:16:03,480
What did he even give me?

14032
08:16:03,940 --> 08:16:05,300
He gave me nothing!

14033
08:16:07,040 --> 08:16:09,240
He just puts it in his inventory!

14034
08:16:11,110 --> 08:16:13,230
No, I'm afraid of trading my helmet.

14035
08:16:13,390 --> 08:16:14,190
Wait, wait...

14036
08:16:14,190 --> 08:16:16,530
My armor has way more... My body...

14037
08:16:16,530 --> 08:16:18,970
Then I would have to wear a chest plate and it has way more...

14038
08:16:18,970 --> 08:16:20,130
I don't give stuff for gold.

14039
08:16:20,230 --> 08:16:22,150
I got one guide!

14040
08:16:23,530 --> 08:16:25,710
Somebody... Don't give him your stuff, don't give him your stuff.

14041
08:16:25,910 --> 08:16:27,250
Okay, hold on, hold on.

14042
08:16:27,470 --> 08:16:28,690
There is...

14043
08:16:28,690 --> 08:16:30,030
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14044
08:16:30,110 --> 08:16:30,990
I found some gold.

14045
08:16:31,210 --> 08:16:35,150
And I just gotta... Hold on, I gotta create a little barrier for it so it doesn't fall into the...

14046
08:16:35,570 --> 08:16:38,270
Into the world, but we'll mine it, we'll mine it.

14047
08:16:38,410 --> 08:16:41,010
They looked at me and just took it and he just took it!

14048
08:16:44,510 --> 08:16:45,150
Oh, shoot.

14049
08:16:46,550 --> 08:16:47,790
Took it from me.

14050
08:16:47,910 --> 08:16:49,750
It was the last thing I owned.

14051
08:16:50,630 --> 08:16:52,650
It was the last thing I owned.

14052
08:16:52,670 --> 08:16:53,530
Is there anyone around here?

14053
08:16:53,630 --> 08:16:54,090
I don't think so.

14054
08:16:54,190 --> 08:16:56,110
He just took it from me.

14055
08:16:56,970 --> 08:16:58,170
That's so cruel.

14056
08:16:59,990 --> 08:17:01,050
Wait, where is it?

14057
08:17:01,170 --> 08:17:01,890
Oh, oh no!

14058
08:17:04,310 --> 08:17:07,430
Oh, here we go.

14059
08:17:07,730 --> 08:17:08,470
Okay, now we're good.

14060
08:17:11,910 --> 08:17:14,530
I can't believe he just took it like that.

14061
08:17:14,530 --> 08:17:15,090
Really?

14062
08:17:15,310 --> 08:17:16,090
You can't believe it?

14063
08:17:16,690 --> 08:17:17,690
I can't believe it.

14064
08:17:17,710 --> 08:17:19,130
I feel like I just got robbed.

14065
08:17:20,450 --> 08:17:24,190
Dragoon did... That Dragoon did more mental damage than, like, someone...

14066
08:17:24,190 --> 08:17:25,310
I just got robbed.

14067
08:17:25,430 --> 08:17:27,330
He, like, looked at me and just...

14068
08:17:27,330 --> 08:17:28,910
Looked and just walked away.

14069
08:17:29,610 --> 08:17:31,770
Walked away with my golden axe.

14070
08:17:31,870 --> 08:17:33,330
I have 36 Nuggies.

14071
08:17:34,610 --> 08:17:35,330
Wait, where are you?

14072
08:17:35,450 --> 08:17:36,070
Okay, I'm here.

14073
08:17:36,150 --> 08:17:36,410
I'm coming.

14074
08:17:37,070 --> 08:17:39,070
Alright, here's the crafting table.

14075
08:17:39,250 --> 08:17:39,510
There you go.

14076
08:17:39,830 --> 08:17:41,710
I have, like, four on me too.

14077
08:17:41,710 --> 08:17:44,230
Oh, I saw an Enderman, I think.

14078
08:17:44,910 --> 08:17:45,110
Hello?

14079
08:17:45,390 --> 08:17:45,790
There he is.

14080
08:17:45,890 --> 08:17:46,030
Okay.

14081
08:17:47,290 --> 08:17:48,490
Yeah, get angry.

14082
08:17:49,230 --> 08:17:49,930
Get angry.

14083
08:17:50,770 --> 08:17:52,050
Drop your pearl.

14084
08:17:53,310 --> 08:17:55,870
Put all your money in the bag, little Enderman.

14085
08:17:56,010 --> 08:17:57,670
Put all your money in the bag.

14086
08:17:59,330 --> 08:17:59,910
Come on.

14087
08:18:00,150 --> 08:18:01,530
Come on, there's two of you.

14088
08:18:01,690 --> 08:18:02,590
Surely two of you.

14089
08:18:02,770 --> 08:18:04,630
Oh my God, he gave me so sad.

14090
08:18:05,010 --> 08:18:06,670
He gave me so sad.

14091
08:18:06,870 --> 08:18:07,890
Wait, what's this?

14092
08:18:08,130 --> 08:18:09,210
Oh, I got an Obsidian!

14093
08:18:09,410 --> 08:18:09,730
Obsidian!

14094
08:18:10,090 --> 08:18:10,470
Nice!

14095
08:18:11,270 --> 08:18:12,410
We just need two more!

14096
08:18:12,550 --> 08:18:12,830
Two more!

14097
08:18:12,910 --> 08:18:13,230
Two more!

14098
08:18:13,310 --> 08:18:13,650
Two more!

14099
08:18:13,790 --> 08:18:14,930
Oh, we just need two more.

14100
08:18:15,530 --> 08:18:16,770
I don't have gold anymore.

14101
08:18:16,850 --> 08:18:17,790
I don't have gold anymore.

14102
08:18:18,170 --> 08:18:19,590
Oh, well, we gotta find some more.

14103
08:18:19,670 --> 08:18:20,330
We gotta find some more.

14104
08:18:20,710 --> 08:18:22,050
We gotta find, we gotta find.

14105
08:18:22,110 --> 08:18:24,830
Back into the nether mines we go.

14106
08:18:24,830 --> 08:18:25,850
The nether mines.

14107
08:18:25,990 --> 08:18:27,370
The nether mines.

14108
08:18:28,350 --> 08:18:31,330
Oh, but we're, like, really far up, so it's, like, hard to dig.

14109
08:18:33,190 --> 08:18:34,270
Okay, I'm just gonna dig.

14110
08:18:36,250 --> 08:18:36,870
And pray.

14111
08:18:37,550 --> 08:18:39,470
I'm gonna pray for no...

14112
08:18:40,110 --> 08:18:42,330
find stuff in the nether mines.

14113
08:18:44,970 --> 08:18:46,090
Okay, right here.

14114
08:18:46,770 --> 08:18:49,330
The nether mines to get out of this hellhole.

14115
08:18:49,910 --> 08:18:50,770
We're doing it!

14116
08:18:50,830 --> 08:18:51,470
We're doing it!

14117
08:18:52,010 --> 08:18:53,410
You found more nuggies?

14118
08:18:53,630 --> 08:18:56,090
No, but we're just, you know, we're doing something.

14119
08:18:56,470 --> 08:18:57,810
We're here.

14120
08:18:58,410 --> 08:18:59,430
I saw the Enderman.

14121
08:19:02,310 --> 08:19:04,650
I'm looking around for nuggies for us.

14122
08:19:04,650 --> 08:19:05,650
I'm not gonna TNT, guys.

14123
08:19:05,710 --> 08:19:06,470
We're too high up.

14124
08:19:06,790 --> 08:19:07,590
It's too risky.

14125
08:19:07,590 --> 08:19:08,610
No, don't do it.

14126
08:19:08,650 --> 08:19:09,170
We can't.

14127
08:19:09,190 --> 08:19:10,050
We can't.

14128
08:19:10,330 --> 08:19:11,210
It's too risky.

14129
08:19:11,830 --> 08:19:12,710
Maybe here.

14130
08:19:15,470 --> 08:19:17,550
I'm just gonna block that guy up.

14131
08:19:18,570 --> 08:19:20,310
Okay, it's too risky.

14132
08:19:21,870 --> 08:19:23,450
Alright, I got some nuggies.

14133
08:19:24,070 --> 08:19:24,730
Okay, nice.

14134
08:19:25,290 --> 08:19:26,410
I'm digging for nuggies.

14135
08:19:27,570 --> 08:19:30,010
I have 51 on me.

14136
08:19:30,230 --> 08:19:30,950
No, nice.

14137
08:19:31,150 --> 08:19:32,950
I'm gonna make some now.

14138
08:19:33,570 --> 08:19:34,730
I don't know how I got up here.

14139
08:19:34,830 --> 08:19:35,370
I'm scared.

14140
08:19:37,590 --> 08:19:39,570
How did I get so high up?

14141
08:19:39,690 --> 08:19:40,330
I don't know.

14142
08:19:41,010 --> 08:19:41,930
What did I do?

14143
08:19:42,290 --> 08:19:45,030
You were like blinded by the gold.

14144
08:19:45,590 --> 08:19:46,790
By the gold.

14145
08:19:47,390 --> 08:19:48,850
I have gold sickness.

14146
08:19:49,330 --> 08:19:52,190
We're literally like the guys in Pocahontas.

14147
08:19:53,390 --> 08:19:55,570
Gold, beautiful gold.

14148
08:19:55,670 --> 08:19:56,050
Gold.

14149
08:19:57,090 --> 08:19:59,150
I don't know how this song goes.

14150
08:20:01,190 --> 08:20:01,870
Gold.

14151
08:20:04,590 --> 08:20:06,510
I have 5 more gold.

14152
08:20:09,330 --> 08:20:10,090
There's gas.

14153
08:20:10,470 --> 08:20:10,810
Yeah.

14154
08:20:11,550 --> 08:20:13,630
There's a gas right in front of us.

14155
08:20:13,870 --> 08:20:15,410
I'm in a cave.

14156
08:20:15,950 --> 08:20:16,770
Looking for gold.

14157
08:20:18,510 --> 08:20:19,270
I am.

14158
08:20:19,510 --> 08:20:20,970
There's a gas right here.

14159
08:20:21,510 --> 08:20:23,510
Just hide and he'll despawn eventually.

14160
08:20:24,730 --> 08:20:26,250
Oh my God, don't rob me, little piggy.

14161
08:20:26,510 --> 08:20:27,590
Don't rob me, child.

14162
08:20:28,850 --> 08:20:29,810
I hear him.

14163
08:20:30,570 --> 08:20:31,390
He's like right there.

14164
08:20:31,470 --> 08:20:32,330
I don't have arrows.

14165
08:20:32,590 --> 08:20:33,750
I don't have arrows.

14166
08:20:33,970 --> 08:20:34,850
Do you see where I am?

14167
08:20:34,910 --> 08:20:36,150
You can hide with me if you want.

14168
08:20:37,310 --> 08:20:38,390
I saw your name tag.

14169
08:20:38,390 --> 08:20:39,850
Oh my God, he broke my crafting table.

14170
08:20:39,930 --> 08:20:40,370
No, I'm fine.

14171
08:20:40,470 --> 08:20:40,830
I'm fine.

14172
08:20:41,010 --> 08:20:42,050
He broke your crafting table.

14173
08:20:42,430 --> 08:20:42,870
I got it.

14174
08:20:42,870 --> 08:20:43,410
I got it back.

14175
08:20:43,490 --> 08:20:43,910
I got it back.

14176
08:20:44,190 --> 08:20:46,150
I have wood, so if you do need another one...

14177
08:20:46,830 --> 08:20:48,470
Where did my other stack of wood go?

14178
08:20:50,210 --> 08:20:52,190
Oh, I do have...

14179
08:20:52,190 --> 08:20:52,610
There we go.

14180
08:20:54,570 --> 08:20:56,770
I put some torches out in case you...

14181
08:20:56,770 --> 08:20:58,310
Okay, this ghastly is like...

14182
08:20:58,710 --> 08:21:00,150
Cooking me from the pigs.

14183
08:21:01,390 --> 08:21:02,190
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

14184
08:21:02,210 --> 08:21:04,110
Just hide and wait until he despawns.

14185
08:21:05,190 --> 08:21:06,490
But I was just...

14186
08:21:06,490 --> 08:21:08,510
I tossed it back in the fortress.

14187
08:21:08,770 --> 08:21:08,910
Oops.

14188
08:21:12,630 --> 08:21:14,270
Oh, why is he here?

14189
08:21:16,370 --> 08:21:20,530
I think it's really messed up that ghasts can spawn in all biomes.

14190
08:21:20,670 --> 08:21:21,630
I think that's like the problem.

14191
08:21:22,010 --> 08:21:22,370
I think...

14192
08:21:23,690 --> 08:21:26,690
I think whoever invented that just hates fun.

14193
08:21:27,070 --> 08:21:27,510
Seriously.

14194
08:21:28,010 --> 08:21:28,790
I think he just...

14195
08:21:28,790 --> 08:21:30,090
I think he just hates people.

14196
08:21:30,090 --> 08:21:34,750
It's actually the worst creature in Minecraft.

14197
08:21:35,390 --> 08:21:35,750
The worst.

14198
08:21:35,990 --> 08:21:37,150
There's two now!

14199
08:21:37,350 --> 08:21:38,290
Two just spawned!

14200
08:21:41,590 --> 08:21:45,550
Instead of it despawning, two showed up!

14201
08:21:47,130 --> 08:21:49,170
We'll get bored of each other eventually.

14202
08:21:49,750 --> 08:21:50,050
Probably.

14203
08:21:52,250 --> 08:21:53,910
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

14204
08:21:55,030 --> 08:21:55,510
No!

14205
08:21:56,450 --> 08:21:57,610
Somebody was like...

14206
08:21:57,610 --> 08:21:58,310
I have eight.

14207
08:21:58,390 --> 08:21:59,110
I have eight.

14208
08:21:59,110 --> 08:22:00,010
Okay, alright.

14209
08:22:00,390 --> 08:22:01,710
Time to use my eight arrows.

14210
08:22:01,790 --> 08:22:03,650
I have one arrow.

14211
08:22:05,850 --> 08:22:06,350
Alright.

14212
08:22:07,210 --> 08:22:08,150
Eight and a dream.

14213
08:22:08,390 --> 08:22:09,070
Let's go.

14214
08:22:12,790 --> 08:22:14,050
Oh, they despawned.

14215
08:22:14,290 --> 08:22:16,230
They actually despawned because I started crying.

14216
08:22:16,490 --> 08:22:16,810
Oh, good.

14217
08:22:17,670 --> 08:22:18,310
I cried too.

14218
08:22:18,810 --> 08:22:19,110
It worked.

14219
08:22:25,650 --> 08:22:27,770
Why can't I get any gold?

14220
08:22:27,770 --> 08:22:28,670
Okay, you know what?

14221
08:22:28,750 --> 08:22:29,090
I give up.

14222
08:22:29,170 --> 08:22:29,590
I'm sorry.

14223
08:22:29,770 --> 08:22:30,190
I tried.

14224
08:22:30,690 --> 08:22:31,150
It's fine.

14225
08:22:31,290 --> 08:22:38,090
We're gonna risk it all on these five golds that I have.

14226
08:22:38,210 --> 08:22:39,770
The five golds left.

14227
08:22:40,370 --> 08:22:41,790
The five golds.

14228
08:22:41,830 --> 08:22:42,990
There's a lot of endermen now.

14229
08:22:43,110 --> 08:22:45,150
If you wanna come over here to farm more enderpearls.

14230
08:22:45,190 --> 08:22:47,770
Yeah, I'm looking around for them.

14231
08:22:48,190 --> 08:22:48,770
Wherever they...

14232
08:22:49,610 --> 08:22:50,110
What the...

14233
08:22:50,110 --> 08:22:50,630
Oh my god.

14234
08:22:50,770 --> 08:22:51,430
Stop it!

14235
08:22:51,490 --> 08:22:52,010
Shut up!

14236
08:22:53,110 --> 08:22:53,590
Freak!

14237
08:22:54,210 --> 08:22:55,450
I don't have anything!

14238
08:22:57,770 --> 08:22:58,270
Oh my god.

14239
08:22:58,330 --> 08:22:59,170
It's just magmas.

14240
08:22:59,550 --> 08:23:00,910
It's just magmas.

14241
08:23:01,550 --> 08:23:01,950
Please.

14242
08:23:03,350 --> 08:23:04,210
Like the fire starters?

14243
08:23:05,630 --> 08:23:06,370
What is that?

14244
08:23:07,430 --> 08:23:08,310
What is this?

14245
08:23:08,450 --> 08:23:10,730
I got a splash potion of fire resistance.

14246
08:23:10,910 --> 08:23:11,730
Oh, that's good though.

14247
08:23:11,950 --> 08:23:13,310
Oh, I got a pearl.

14248
08:23:13,470 --> 08:23:13,910
I got a pearl.

14249
08:23:14,730 --> 08:23:15,250
I got another.

14250
08:23:15,290 --> 08:23:16,650
I got another obsidian.

14251
08:23:16,770 --> 08:23:17,430
I got another one.

14252
08:23:17,570 --> 08:23:18,110
Oh, nice.

14253
08:23:18,210 --> 08:23:18,270
Nice.

14254
08:23:18,390 --> 08:23:18,770
One more.

14255
08:23:18,970 --> 08:23:19,350
One more.

14256
08:23:19,430 --> 08:23:19,770
One more.

14257
08:23:21,030 --> 08:23:22,270
I don't have gold.

14258
08:23:22,370 --> 08:23:23,550
I don't have anymore gold.

14259
08:23:24,190 --> 08:23:24,730
You wanna...

14260
08:23:24,730 --> 08:23:26,310
Here, come to my cave.

14261
08:23:26,310 --> 08:23:30,410
It's bad, but I started it so you can find it because...

14262
08:23:30,410 --> 08:23:30,830
No, I don't...

14263
08:23:30,830 --> 08:23:32,210
I don't trust myself.

14264
08:23:32,330 --> 08:23:32,690
I don't...

14265
08:23:32,690 --> 08:23:33,030
In here.

14266
08:23:33,090 --> 08:23:33,530
I don't...

14267
08:23:33,530 --> 08:23:34,490
I don't trust myself.

14268
08:23:34,490 --> 08:23:34,990
It's safe in here.

14269
08:23:35,010 --> 08:23:35,950
What if I dig to lava?

14270
08:23:36,310 --> 08:23:38,310
What if I dig into lava?

14271
08:23:38,510 --> 08:23:38,550
Then just...

14272
08:23:38,550 --> 08:23:38,990
Then you...

14273
08:23:38,990 --> 08:23:39,570
Then you...

14274
08:23:39,570 --> 08:23:40,710
Then you block it.

14275
08:23:43,970 --> 08:23:45,710
Then you block the lava.

14276
08:23:48,370 --> 08:23:50,490
Oh my god, how many lavas did you block?

14277
08:23:50,590 --> 08:23:51,250
Wait, we need ten?

14278
08:23:51,330 --> 08:23:52,310
I thought we needed eight.

14279
08:23:53,870 --> 08:23:54,650
Nope.

14280
08:23:55,090 --> 08:23:56,590
Guess it wasn't eight.

14281
08:23:57,170 --> 08:23:57,470
Yes.

14282
08:23:59,950 --> 08:24:00,590
Oh, never mind.

14283
08:24:00,670 --> 08:24:01,190
We need ten.

14284
08:24:02,130 --> 08:24:02,390
Oh.

14285
08:24:02,650 --> 08:24:03,510
We need three more.

14286
08:24:04,090 --> 08:24:04,610
Oh.

14287
08:24:06,010 --> 08:24:06,790
Okay.

14288
08:24:08,870 --> 08:24:10,870
It's three on each side.

14289
08:24:13,150 --> 08:24:14,510
Two on top.

14290
08:24:15,550 --> 08:24:15,910
Oh.

14291
08:24:16,750 --> 08:24:17,530
Oh.

14292
08:24:18,250 --> 08:24:19,270
I found quartz.

14293
08:24:20,770 --> 08:24:22,290
I found quartz.

14294
08:24:22,310 --> 08:24:23,570
Look at that.

14295
08:24:23,650 --> 08:24:25,330
Look at that silly quartz over there.

14296
08:24:25,470 --> 08:24:26,690
Oh, it's ten without the corners.

14297
08:24:26,930 --> 08:24:29,870
Oh, I thought it was ten with the corners.

14298
08:24:32,650 --> 08:24:34,330
What the hell is that sound?

14299
08:24:34,710 --> 08:24:34,810
Look at that.

14300
08:24:35,010 --> 08:24:36,190
It's so silly.

14301
08:24:36,790 --> 08:24:38,310
It's so silly.

14302
08:24:39,070 --> 08:24:39,690
So silly.

14303
08:24:40,870 --> 08:24:42,610
Silly little quartz.

14304
08:24:43,730 --> 08:24:45,330
Oh, there's another ghast.

14305
08:24:46,570 --> 08:24:47,090
Somewhere.

14306
08:24:49,410 --> 08:24:49,930
What?

14307
08:24:50,010 --> 08:24:50,290
What happened?

14308
08:24:50,490 --> 08:24:50,730
Lava?

14309
08:24:50,730 --> 08:24:51,250
Lava.

14310
08:24:51,610 --> 08:24:51,890
Yeah.

14311
08:24:52,890 --> 08:24:54,110
Just stay far enough back.

14312
08:24:54,230 --> 08:24:55,450
Just stay far enough back.

14313
08:24:56,850 --> 08:24:58,950
Are you sure there's gonna be gold here?

14314
08:24:59,850 --> 08:25:00,810
Are you sure?

14315
08:25:01,290 --> 08:25:01,770
I don't know.

14316
08:25:01,890 --> 08:25:03,390
I'm saying you can just use my hole.

14317
08:25:04,550 --> 08:25:06,670
Oh, it's a used hole.

14318
08:25:07,230 --> 08:25:08,110
I'm sorry.

14319
08:25:08,430 --> 08:25:10,370
Go build your own new hole.

14320
08:25:12,210 --> 08:25:13,870
Go get your own new hole.

14321
08:25:13,950 --> 08:25:14,470
I don't know.

14322
08:25:14,470 --> 08:25:14,570
Go!

14323
08:25:18,730 --> 08:25:20,930
I said that because I used it.

14324
08:25:20,990 --> 08:25:22,690
Then probably you would...

14325
08:25:22,690 --> 08:25:24,190
And I didn't find anything in there.

14326
08:25:24,270 --> 08:25:26,030
Then probably you would do it and then...

14327
08:25:26,030 --> 08:25:26,550
It's a bad hole.

14328
08:25:26,790 --> 08:25:27,750
You would find it.

14329
08:25:27,830 --> 08:25:29,170
You know, that's how that works, right?

14330
08:25:32,910 --> 08:25:33,970
I'm gonna go up.

14331
08:25:34,610 --> 08:25:35,530
It must be...

14332
08:25:35,530 --> 08:25:36,910
I wish the ghast would disappear.

14333
08:25:37,890 --> 08:25:38,690
Please leave.

14334
08:25:38,850 --> 08:25:39,770
You're not welcome here.

14335
08:25:40,750 --> 08:25:41,530
This is our hole.

14336
08:25:43,310 --> 08:25:44,390
You're not welcome.

14337
08:25:44,390 --> 08:25:46,570
Nobody likes you.

14338
08:25:46,690 --> 08:25:48,650
Even your mother hates you.

14339
08:25:49,630 --> 08:25:50,310
Nobody likes you.

14340
08:25:50,850 --> 08:25:52,650
Your mother put you up for adoption.

14341
08:25:52,850 --> 08:25:54,050
Nobody adopted you.

14342
08:25:54,110 --> 08:25:54,750
Oh my god.

14343
08:26:01,090 --> 08:26:03,250
You were thinking the same thing.

14344
08:26:03,870 --> 08:26:06,630
I don't think I was thinking that extreme.

14345
08:26:06,730 --> 08:26:07,310
That far.

14346
08:26:07,630 --> 08:26:09,730
You were thinking the same thing.

14347
08:26:10,230 --> 08:26:11,030
Don't lie.

14348
08:26:11,450 --> 08:26:12,730
It was in your head.

14349
08:26:12,730 --> 08:26:14,010
I don't know...

14350
08:26:14,010 --> 08:26:15,850
The ghasts...

14351
08:26:15,850 --> 08:26:16,710
How do they...

14352
08:26:16,710 --> 08:26:17,910
How do they board?

14353
08:26:27,370 --> 08:26:28,590
Stay back mister.

14354
08:26:28,670 --> 08:26:29,470
Stay back mister.

14355
08:26:41,820 --> 08:26:42,680
Are you okay?

14356
08:26:44,140 --> 08:26:45,360
What are you doing?

14357
08:26:45,640 --> 08:26:47,060
I'm getting cold.

14358
08:26:47,260 --> 08:26:50,300
But I'm doing the most risky shit to get this fucking cold.

14359
08:26:50,620 --> 08:26:51,200
Do you want TNT?

14360
08:26:52,040 --> 08:26:52,600
No!

14361
08:26:53,280 --> 08:26:54,680
That's risky shit, man.

14362
08:26:55,260 --> 08:26:56,920
I can give you the good risky stuff.

14363
08:26:57,580 --> 08:26:58,180
TNT.

14364
08:26:58,980 --> 08:27:00,760
It's the real risky stuff.

14365
08:27:01,460 --> 08:27:01,860
Come on.

14366
08:27:02,560 --> 08:27:03,740
Blow it all up.

14367
08:27:03,880 --> 08:27:05,620
Blow it to hell, doggy!

14368
08:27:11,100 --> 08:27:12,280
Open air gold?

14369
08:27:13,120 --> 08:27:15,340
You gotta go to TNT Anonymous.

14370
08:27:18,060 --> 08:27:19,920
I got more magma...

14371
08:27:19,920 --> 08:27:21,300
Magma cream.

14372
08:27:21,300 --> 08:27:22,040
Magma cream...

14373
08:27:23,360 --> 08:27:27,960
Will help us make more fire resistant stuff, I guess.

14374
08:27:30,480 --> 08:27:32,120
You know, man...

14375
08:27:32,120 --> 08:27:33,860
I feel like we're gonna make it to the end...

14376
08:27:33,860 --> 08:27:34,840
And then we're gonna die.

14377
08:27:34,980 --> 08:27:35,540
Don't say that.

14378
08:27:36,080 --> 08:27:38,520
I've been thinking it this literal entire time.

14379
08:27:40,000 --> 08:27:40,540
Don't...

14380
08:27:41,160 --> 08:27:41,700
Don't...

14381
08:27:41,700 --> 08:27:44,060
I've been literally thinking it this entire time.

14382
08:27:44,180 --> 08:27:44,800
I think...

14383
08:27:44,800 --> 08:27:47,100
I think we're gonna make it...

14384
08:27:47,100 --> 08:27:49,340
The Ender Dragon is not that bad.

14385
08:27:49,340 --> 08:27:50,960
All we need is the slow falling.

14386
08:27:50,980 --> 08:27:53,520
What if we get there...

14387
08:27:53,520 --> 08:27:55,220
You know, we do the thing...

14388
08:27:55,220 --> 08:27:57,060
And then, like, the Ender Dragon...

14389
08:27:57,060 --> 08:27:58,260
He sweeps up...

14390
08:27:58,260 --> 08:28:00,660
And then knocks us out of the thing...

14391
08:28:00,660 --> 08:28:01,040
And then...

14392
08:28:01,040 --> 08:28:02,880
All we need is the slow falling.

14393
08:28:03,120 --> 08:28:04,020
All we need is the slow falling.

14394
08:28:04,040 --> 08:28:04,620
And then it happens.

14395
08:28:05,200 --> 08:28:06,000
What do we need?

14396
08:28:06,060 --> 08:28:06,840
How do we make it?

14397
08:28:06,900 --> 08:28:07,700
How do we make it?

14398
08:28:07,960 --> 08:28:08,700
How do we make what?

14399
08:28:09,400 --> 08:28:10,280
Slow falling.

14400
08:28:10,920 --> 08:28:12,300
Oh, we need the phantoms.

14401
08:28:12,880 --> 08:28:13,760
We need to not sleep.

14402
08:28:14,020 --> 08:28:14,300
OK.

14403
08:28:15,060 --> 08:28:15,960
OK, that's fine.

14404
08:28:17,220 --> 08:28:18,240
That should be fine, right?

14405
08:28:18,240 --> 08:28:19,500
That should be fine.

14406
08:28:19,560 --> 08:28:20,500
Yeah, we can do that.

14407
08:28:20,660 --> 08:28:21,240
We can just...

14408
08:28:21,240 --> 08:28:22,240
We can chill in a village...

14409
08:28:23,280 --> 08:28:23,720
And...

14410
08:28:23,720 --> 08:28:25,420
When we don't sleep...

14411
08:28:25,420 --> 08:28:26,640
We just don't sleep...

14412
08:28:28,040 --> 08:28:28,480
What?

14413
08:28:29,440 --> 08:28:29,880
What?

14414
08:28:30,620 --> 08:28:31,500
What is...

14415
08:28:31,500 --> 08:28:32,400
No, that's not a...

14416
08:28:32,400 --> 08:28:32,780
It's a good thing.

14417
08:28:33,320 --> 08:28:34,520
Oh, it's a good guess.

14418
08:28:34,620 --> 08:28:35,140
What is it?

14419
08:28:35,460 --> 08:28:36,960
I found netherite.

14420
08:28:38,220 --> 08:28:39,180
Oh, just one?

14421
08:28:39,340 --> 08:28:40,900
Don't you know we need a lot more?

14422
08:28:41,160 --> 08:28:44,600
Yeah, but I found some even at 78.

14423
08:28:44,900 --> 08:28:46,320
Oh, I found two netherites.

14424
08:28:46,820 --> 08:28:49,820
OK, now that's the good shit.

14425
08:28:54,390 --> 08:28:55,750
There's a ghast here.

14426
08:28:55,850 --> 08:28:57,570
Why is there a ghast here?

14427
08:28:57,990 --> 08:28:59,390
I have to use the arrow.

14428
08:28:59,870 --> 08:29:00,270
I'm scared.

14429
08:29:00,450 --> 08:29:01,710
Never mind this, though.

14430
08:29:03,370 --> 08:29:04,310
Where did he go?

14431
08:29:06,270 --> 08:29:07,070
No lava.

14432
08:29:07,250 --> 08:29:08,630
I know, I need no lava.

14433
08:29:09,110 --> 08:29:10,430
Oh my gosh, I can't believe there was two!

14434
08:29:11,770 --> 08:29:12,170
Wow.

14435
08:29:13,410 --> 08:29:13,810
OK.

14436
08:29:14,030 --> 08:29:14,690
I didn't pick it up.

14437
08:29:15,930 --> 08:29:16,510
Oh shit, you're right.

14438
08:29:16,510 --> 08:29:18,210
OK, I have six now.

14439
08:29:18,510 --> 08:29:20,610
I have six gold.

14440
08:29:22,230 --> 08:29:23,910
Alright, all in.

14441
08:29:25,250 --> 08:29:27,330
I know the lava won't burn it, but I don't want to die.

14442
08:29:31,690 --> 08:29:33,050
Yeah, baby!

14443
08:29:36,750 --> 08:29:39,310
Oh my gosh.

14444
08:29:42,130 --> 08:29:42,810
Wowee.

14445
08:29:44,270 --> 08:29:44,950
Quartz?

14446
08:29:44,950 --> 08:29:46,230
Lucky baby.

14447
08:29:47,870 --> 08:29:50,290
Please, out of these six, just give me obsidian.

14448
08:29:50,590 --> 08:29:52,270
Please, not magma!

14449
08:29:52,990 --> 08:29:55,330
I gave you six gold!

14450
08:29:56,630 --> 08:29:57,350
I

14451
08:30:02,460 --> 08:30:05,100
got crying obsidian.

14452
08:30:05,780 --> 08:30:07,120
Crying obsidian?

14453
08:30:07,300 --> 08:30:08,300
That's literally you.

14454
08:30:10,540 --> 08:30:16,700
He gave me crying out of all the obsidians.

14455
08:30:17,920 --> 08:30:25,880
I'm so sorry, I wasn't specific enough regarding the exact type of obsidian I needed.

14456
08:30:26,440 --> 08:30:28,740
I'm so sorry.

14457
08:30:29,320 --> 08:30:32,860
How much diamond do you have?

14458
08:30:33,400 --> 08:30:34,680
I have eleven.

14459
08:30:35,300 --> 08:30:35,720
OK.

14460
08:30:36,640 --> 08:30:37,880
My pickaxe is about to...

14461
08:30:37,880 --> 08:30:41,720
Actually, I'll just make an iron one.

14462
08:30:42,380 --> 08:30:45,740
Alright, back into the mines we go.

14463
08:30:46,700 --> 08:30:48,840
Back into the...

14464
08:30:48,840 --> 08:30:49,600
I'm mining too.

14465
08:30:50,200 --> 08:30:51,300
Oh, you got some gold?

14466
08:30:51,580 --> 08:30:51,800
No.

14467
08:30:52,160 --> 08:30:53,860
I haven't gotten literally anything.

14468
08:30:54,340 --> 08:30:56,320
I got the netherite actually.

14469
08:30:56,420 --> 08:30:59,020
That's literally the only thing we actually need.

14470
08:30:59,440 --> 08:31:00,380
Is gold, I know.

14471
08:31:01,000 --> 08:31:03,020
Oh, and I made it to the other side.

14472
08:31:03,680 --> 08:31:05,420
I wish I kept all that obsidian.

14473
08:31:05,940 --> 08:31:08,800
I wish I kept all that obsidian earlier.

14474
08:31:09,200 --> 08:31:10,280
There's so many...

14475
08:31:10,280 --> 08:31:12,380
So much endermen around me.

14476
08:31:12,380 --> 08:31:14,540
I wish we were here exterminating them.

14477
08:31:14,600 --> 08:31:16,740
I don't trust myself making a little house.

14478
08:31:16,760 --> 08:31:18,240
OK, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

14479
08:31:19,300 --> 08:31:20,860
It's just a little house.

14480
08:31:21,860 --> 08:31:23,160
I don't trust myself.

14481
08:31:23,260 --> 08:31:25,560
There's like four endermen right next to me.

14482
08:31:25,580 --> 08:31:26,900
I hear a ghastly though.

14483
08:31:27,540 --> 08:31:29,460
Alright, come to me, come to me and make a house.

14484
08:31:30,800 --> 08:31:32,000
Oh my god, you're still alive?

14485
08:31:32,060 --> 08:31:33,600
Yes, we've been in the nether.

14486
08:31:33,760 --> 08:31:34,220
Yes, yes.

14487
08:31:34,260 --> 08:31:35,460
Yes, we've been in the nether.

14488
08:31:35,600 --> 08:31:36,760
Yes, we've been in the nether.

14489
08:31:37,020 --> 08:31:37,580
Yes, yes.

14490
08:31:37,600 --> 08:31:38,360
Yes, yes.

14491
08:31:38,380 --> 08:31:40,000
We have been in the nether for like maybe two hours.

14492
08:31:40,000 --> 08:31:40,200
Where are you?

14493
08:31:40,200 --> 08:31:40,960
Two hours.

14494
08:31:41,280 --> 08:31:43,800
Look up.

14495
08:31:44,320 --> 08:31:46,660
Hold on, I'm getting endermen.

14496
08:31:48,420 --> 08:31:49,500
Come here.

14497
08:31:49,980 --> 08:31:50,900
Come here, Endy.

14498
08:31:51,880 --> 08:31:52,640
Endy.

14499
08:31:54,560 --> 08:31:55,320
Endy.

14500
08:31:56,480 --> 08:31:57,240
Endy.

14501
08:31:58,280 --> 08:31:58,920
One more.

14502
08:31:59,980 --> 08:32:00,940
One more again.

14503
08:32:01,920 --> 08:32:03,360
One more, one more.

14504
08:32:05,140 --> 08:32:07,060
And this guy too.

14505
08:32:08,340 --> 08:32:10,020
Where are you?

14506
08:32:14,480 --> 08:32:16,320
I'm with endermen too.

14507
08:32:21,280 --> 08:32:25,060
I see gold, but it's kind of like...

14508
08:32:25,700 --> 08:32:26,260
It might be risky.

14509
08:32:26,660 --> 08:32:27,840
No, they're very risky gold.

14510
08:32:27,940 --> 08:32:30,120
They are definitely very risky gold.

14511
08:32:30,800 --> 08:32:33,780
I've been enjoying some risky gold lately.

14512
08:32:34,720 --> 08:32:37,040
I've been risking it all.

14513
08:32:37,160 --> 08:32:38,000
The thrill of the hunt.

14514
08:32:38,480 --> 08:32:39,840
Are you feeling the thrill?

14515
08:32:40,900 --> 08:32:42,440
Oh, I feel it.

14516
08:32:42,480 --> 08:32:43,720
I'm feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

14517
08:32:43,820 --> 08:32:45,560
I'm fucking feeling it right now.

14518
08:32:45,920 --> 08:32:49,220
Oh my gosh, nothing.

14519
08:32:51,800 --> 08:32:53,100
I left for four hours.

14520
08:32:53,260 --> 08:32:53,880
What happened?

14521
08:32:59,800 --> 08:33:01,460
Oh, that's a good one.

14522
08:33:01,580 --> 08:33:02,740
That's a good one.

14523
08:33:03,640 --> 08:33:05,000
Oh, that's good.

14524
08:33:05,020 --> 08:33:05,720
That's rich.

14525
08:33:05,880 --> 08:33:06,860
That's real rich.

14526
08:33:07,940 --> 08:33:09,400
Where are you?

14527
08:33:11,160 --> 08:33:15,400
I'm fucking feeling really, really risky right now.

14528
08:33:15,520 --> 08:33:16,720
This is really risky.

14529
08:33:17,200 --> 08:33:18,380
Don't, don't, please.

14530
08:33:20,600 --> 08:33:24,420
It'd be so silly if something just... something happened.

14531
08:33:25,940 --> 08:33:27,100
Oh my god, ghast.

14532
08:33:27,280 --> 08:33:28,120
No, please.

14533
08:33:28,420 --> 08:33:29,480
I'm coming back.

14534
08:33:29,880 --> 08:33:30,360
Ghast gold.

14535
08:33:30,360 --> 08:33:30,920
I have more.

14536
08:33:31,300 --> 08:33:32,680
I have more gold.

14537
08:33:33,280 --> 08:33:33,640
Let's go.

14538
08:33:33,820 --> 08:33:34,860
I got a stack.

14539
08:33:36,680 --> 08:33:37,420
Let's go.

14540
08:33:37,580 --> 08:33:38,920
Oh, I almost fell into this.

14541
08:33:40,320 --> 08:33:42,920
That would have been pretty dramatic.

14542
08:33:44,120 --> 08:33:46,500
That would have been pretty bad, I'd say.

14543
08:33:47,740 --> 08:33:48,320
I have seven.

14544
08:33:48,440 --> 08:33:49,200
I have seven more.

14545
08:33:49,400 --> 08:33:50,160
Seven more stacks.

14546
08:33:50,200 --> 08:33:50,600
Let's go.

14547
08:33:51,380 --> 08:33:52,260
Seven more.

14548
08:33:52,860 --> 08:33:54,860
I'm trying to... I thought I saw some gold over here.

14549
08:33:55,080 --> 08:33:56,360
I was just gonna...

14550
08:33:57,660 --> 08:33:58,740
Oh, there you go.

14551
08:33:59,200 --> 08:34:00,580
Oh, I see some up here.

14552
08:34:00,700 --> 08:34:01,400
Okay, I'll get that.

14553
08:34:02,080 --> 08:34:03,560
Alright, here we go.

14554
08:34:03,840 --> 08:34:05,740
Oh, this might be risky, but...

14555
08:34:06,320 --> 08:34:06,980
We'll see.

14556
08:34:08,540 --> 08:34:09,420
There he is.

14557
08:34:09,860 --> 08:34:10,780
There he is.

14558
08:34:11,720 --> 08:34:12,760
There he is.

14559
08:34:12,880 --> 08:34:13,080
Going through.

14560
08:34:14,420 --> 08:34:15,840
How many inner pearls do you have?

14561
08:34:16,740 --> 08:34:17,180
Three.

14562
08:34:18,560 --> 08:34:20,180
Yeah, three, so we have six.

14563
08:34:20,360 --> 08:34:21,340
Oh, here's the arrows.

14564
08:34:22,980 --> 08:34:24,440
I'm getting more gold.

14565
08:34:27,260 --> 08:34:28,020
What'd he give you?

14566
08:34:30,060 --> 08:34:30,800
What'd he give you?

14567
08:34:32,100 --> 08:34:32,680
Is that it?

14568
08:34:33,580 --> 08:34:34,360
Is that it?

14569
08:34:34,620 --> 08:34:35,320
I'm so sorry.

14570
08:34:35,360 --> 08:34:36,260
I'm so sorry.

14571
08:34:36,340 --> 08:34:37,180
I'm so sorry.

14572
08:34:37,720 --> 08:34:38,400
Is that it?

14573
08:34:39,320 --> 08:34:40,020
Is that it?

14574
08:34:40,860 --> 08:34:41,920
I got another one.

14575
08:34:42,200 --> 08:34:43,120
I got another one.

14576
08:34:43,500 --> 08:34:44,560
I got another one.

14577
08:34:44,920 --> 08:34:45,840
We got another one.

14578
08:34:46,080 --> 08:34:46,980
We got another one.

14579
08:34:47,060 --> 08:34:47,920
We need two more.

14580
08:34:48,260 --> 08:34:49,420
Yes, we need two more.

14581
08:34:49,880 --> 08:34:50,940
We need two more.

14582
08:34:51,480 --> 08:34:53,020
We need two more.

14583
08:34:59,480 --> 08:35:00,780
Did I grab that?

14584
08:35:00,920 --> 08:35:01,700
Wait, where did it go?

14585
08:35:02,040 --> 08:35:03,400
Where did the... Where did it go?

14586
08:35:03,700 --> 08:35:04,120
No!

14587
08:35:04,400 --> 08:35:05,220
Where did it go?

14588
08:35:06,400 --> 08:35:07,580
We'll never know.

14589
08:35:08,040 --> 08:35:09,340
We'll never know.

14590
08:35:10,180 --> 08:35:11,680
We'll never know.

14591
08:35:11,900 --> 08:35:13,340
Thank you for the arrow, sir.

14592
08:35:13,780 --> 08:35:15,440
Alright, last one.

14593
08:35:15,920 --> 08:35:17,360
Last one.

14594
08:35:19,820 --> 08:35:24,720
I like when people come in and are just like, how have they been up to this for eight hours?

14595
08:35:24,720 --> 08:35:26,520
We're not speedrunners.

14596
08:35:27,120 --> 08:35:28,220
It's gravel.

14597
08:35:28,660 --> 08:35:30,400
It's fucking gravel.

14598
08:35:30,540 --> 08:35:33,480
Here, I have fourteen pieces of nuggets.

14599
08:35:34,280 --> 08:35:34,860
Fourteen?

14600
08:35:34,960 --> 08:35:36,300
Only fourteen nuggets?

14601
08:35:36,300 --> 08:35:37,180
I'm sorry!

14602
08:35:37,420 --> 08:35:38,560
It was all that I could get!

14603
08:35:38,800 --> 08:35:40,680
Only fourteen nuggets?

14604
08:35:40,980 --> 08:35:41,520
Okay.

14605
08:35:42,480 --> 08:35:44,920
That nugget could be life or death.

14606
08:35:47,300 --> 08:35:49,300
Alright, here's... Where are you?

14607
08:35:49,400 --> 08:35:49,920
Here you go.

14608
08:35:50,800 --> 08:35:52,520
Here's the obsidian next to you.

14609
08:35:52,520 --> 08:35:53,120
Oh, wait.

14610
08:35:53,200 --> 08:35:53,960
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14611
08:35:55,540 --> 08:35:56,560
He won't attack you.

14612
08:35:56,660 --> 08:35:57,240
He's aggroed on you.

14613
08:35:58,620 --> 08:35:59,520
Where is it?

14614
08:35:59,960 --> 08:36:00,600
Did you give it to me?

14615
08:36:00,680 --> 08:36:01,260
Wait, wait, wait.

14616
08:36:01,260 --> 08:36:01,680
No, no.

14617
08:36:01,880 --> 08:36:02,680
I took it back.

14618
08:36:03,080 --> 08:36:04,140
I'll give it to you later.

14619
08:36:04,420 --> 08:36:05,100
Oh, I got it.

14620
08:36:05,160 --> 08:36:05,600
Okay, come here.

14621
08:36:06,420 --> 08:36:06,940
I'll take it.

14622
08:36:07,560 --> 08:36:08,740
Alright, here you go.

14623
08:36:11,400 --> 08:36:12,020
Here you go.

14624
08:36:12,080 --> 08:36:12,900
Here's two more.

14625
08:36:13,160 --> 08:36:14,040
Here's two more.

14626
08:36:15,720 --> 08:36:16,820
We just need two!

14627
08:36:17,800 --> 08:36:18,840
Two out of two?

14628
08:36:19,940 --> 08:36:20,860
Crying obsidian.

14629
08:36:22,100 --> 08:36:23,180
Crying obsidian.

14630
08:36:24,460 --> 08:36:25,380
At least he gave us two.

14631
08:36:25,520 --> 08:36:26,000
Quartz.

14632
08:36:26,580 --> 08:36:26,960
Quartz.

14633
08:36:27,620 --> 08:36:29,160
Hey, he gave us two though!

14634
08:36:29,500 --> 08:36:30,520
He gave us two!

14635
08:36:33,040 --> 08:36:34,740
He gave us two!

14636
08:36:37,400 --> 08:36:38,680
There's a lot above us.

14637
08:36:38,740 --> 08:36:39,840
I'm fucking doing it.

14638
08:36:40,120 --> 08:36:41,140
It's life or death.

14639
08:36:41,200 --> 08:36:42,140
It's above us.

14640
08:36:42,180 --> 08:36:43,220
It's life or death.

14641
08:36:43,320 --> 08:36:44,700
I'm fucking... I'm going for it.

14642
08:36:45,060 --> 08:36:46,400
I'm gonna go for it.

14643
08:36:46,440 --> 08:36:47,480
I'm gonna go above.

14644
08:36:47,480 --> 08:36:48,740
I'm going up.

14645
08:36:48,840 --> 08:36:50,580
I'm gonna go up and see the world!

14646
08:36:50,760 --> 08:36:51,160
Mom!

14647
08:36:51,420 --> 08:36:52,360
I'm gonna do it!

14648
08:36:54,300 --> 08:37:01,360
Okay, when you do it, build like a little bridge underneath it and don't lock underneath it, you know?

14649
08:37:02,120 --> 08:37:04,240
I'm gonna see the world!

14650
08:37:06,520 --> 08:37:07,520
Where is this?

14651
08:37:08,140 --> 08:37:09,300
I'll catch them all.

14652
08:37:09,440 --> 08:37:11,140
Catch them all!

14653
08:37:11,900 --> 08:37:13,300
Catch them all!

14654
08:37:13,700 --> 08:37:14,800
They're in the trees.

14655
08:37:15,180 --> 08:37:16,520
I got one of them.

14656
08:37:16,840 --> 08:37:18,020
Hold on, I got one.

14657
08:37:18,300 --> 08:37:18,740
I got one.

14658
08:37:18,840 --> 08:37:20,180
There's more over there.

14659
08:37:20,360 --> 08:37:22,240
Okay, there's more over here too.

14660
08:37:22,420 --> 08:37:23,080
I'm gonna grab it.

14661
08:37:23,080 --> 08:37:24,060
Wait, I can't grab it.

14662
08:37:24,180 --> 08:37:24,560
Oh, shoot.

14663
08:37:24,680 --> 08:37:25,420
Oh, get rid of that.

14664
08:37:25,520 --> 08:37:25,920
Okay, there we go.

14665
08:37:27,820 --> 08:37:28,620
I grabbed some.

14666
08:37:28,740 --> 08:37:29,240
I grabbed some.

14667
08:37:29,780 --> 08:37:31,040
I don't know where the other ones are.

14668
08:37:31,720 --> 08:37:33,120
Okay, I got some here too.

14669
08:37:33,680 --> 08:37:34,320
How many you got?

14670
08:37:34,720 --> 08:37:35,080
Nine?

14671
08:37:36,040 --> 08:37:37,180
Okay, I got 21.

14672
08:37:37,440 --> 08:37:39,120
Okay, there's more over here.

14673
08:37:39,180 --> 08:37:42,980
I'm gonna fucking...

14674
08:37:42,980 --> 08:37:46,180
They're just like, yeah, take her tower.

14675
08:37:46,440 --> 08:37:46,720
No!

14676
08:37:47,580 --> 08:37:49,660
Do you know how much we've been through?

14677
08:37:50,040 --> 08:37:51,240
We've been through so much.

14678
08:37:51,240 --> 08:37:53,120
We are past sabotage!

14679
08:37:54,340 --> 08:37:55,380
We're past it.

14680
08:37:55,480 --> 08:37:58,020
We are so past it.

14681
08:37:58,300 --> 08:37:58,720
Please!

14682
08:38:00,060 --> 08:38:01,640
They're like, haha, wouldn't it be funny?

14683
08:38:01,740 --> 08:38:05,260
I know you've been streaming for eight hours, but what if you just killed her right now?

14684
08:38:06,100 --> 08:38:07,620
Don't worry, we'll just do it.

14685
08:38:07,660 --> 08:38:09,000
We don't have to kill each other.

14686
08:38:09,060 --> 08:38:10,740
The dragon's gonna do it for us!

14687
08:38:10,740 --> 08:38:11,960
No, it's not!

14688
08:38:13,920 --> 08:38:15,840
We'll just do the bed strut.

14689
08:38:16,520 --> 08:38:16,920
Catch it!

14690
08:38:17,040 --> 08:38:17,480
Catch it!

14691
08:38:17,580 --> 08:38:18,020
Catch it!

14692
08:38:18,040 --> 08:38:18,520
Catch what?

14693
08:38:18,600 --> 08:38:19,800
I don't even know where you are!

14694
08:38:21,640 --> 08:38:23,040
Okay, hold on.

14695
08:38:23,140 --> 08:38:23,660
I see you.

14696
08:38:23,760 --> 08:38:24,500
I caught it.

14697
08:38:24,560 --> 08:38:25,120
I caught it.

14698
08:38:25,140 --> 08:38:25,580
I caught it.

14699
08:38:25,580 --> 08:38:26,220
I caught it.

14700
08:38:26,280 --> 08:38:26,780
Oh, I see you.

14701
08:38:26,880 --> 08:38:27,460
Grab that one.

14702
08:38:27,820 --> 08:38:28,300
You got it.

14703
08:38:28,420 --> 08:38:29,280
Oh, no, you didn't get it.

14704
08:38:29,360 --> 08:38:29,660
There you go.

14705
08:38:29,740 --> 08:38:30,760
You got it.

14706
08:38:31,360 --> 08:38:32,720
Okay, I have 37 here.

14707
08:38:34,700 --> 08:38:35,540
I have nine.

14708
08:38:36,320 --> 08:38:37,740
Okay, pass it along.

14709
08:38:38,140 --> 08:38:38,860
Pass it along.

14710
08:38:39,020 --> 08:38:39,540
I'm getting mad.

14711
08:38:39,580 --> 08:38:40,940
I've got another seven rolls.

14712
08:38:41,420 --> 08:38:45,580
I think we could've traveled back!

14713
08:38:46,100 --> 08:38:46,440
I think!

14714
08:38:46,580 --> 08:38:48,720
No, we definitely could not have.

14715
08:38:48,920 --> 08:38:49,560
We could've died.

14716
08:38:49,680 --> 08:38:50,160
No, you're right.

14717
08:38:50,280 --> 08:38:50,300
We could've died.

14718
08:38:50,300 --> 08:38:52,200
Yeah, we definitely could not have.

14719
08:38:53,240 --> 08:38:54,140
No, you're right.

14720
08:38:54,220 --> 08:38:54,580
You're right.

14721
08:38:54,820 --> 08:38:56,120
We definitely would've died.

14722
08:38:56,120 --> 08:38:56,800
Yeah.

14723
08:38:57,460 --> 08:38:58,020
Yeah.

14724
08:38:58,440 --> 08:38:59,520
Where is the Enderman?

14725
08:39:00,680 --> 08:39:01,240
Enderman!

14726
08:39:02,560 --> 08:39:03,120
Enderman!

14727
08:39:04,360 --> 08:39:05,880
Please, my sweet Enderman.

14728
08:39:07,680 --> 08:39:10,300
Oh my god, I don't want the child to rob me again.

14729
08:39:10,520 --> 08:39:12,120
No, I don't want...

14730
08:39:14,760 --> 08:39:17,240
Don't Akasupa with that.

14731
08:39:17,580 --> 08:39:18,800
You're trying to bait me.

14732
08:39:19,140 --> 08:39:20,640
Oh, to kill me?

14733
08:39:20,780 --> 08:39:21,120
No!

14734
08:39:21,840 --> 08:39:23,920
You're trying to make me say something!

14735
08:39:30,320 --> 08:39:34,120
I know what you're trying to make me say.

14736
08:39:36,830 --> 08:39:40,820
I don't want your stupid iron nuggets, please.

14737
08:39:41,460 --> 08:39:42,640
He was kind of far, but...

14738
08:39:42,640 --> 08:39:43,920
Oh my god, please.

14739
08:39:44,040 --> 08:39:49,420
Why do you keep giving me cry obsidian?

14740
08:39:51,910 --> 08:39:54,920
I wish you could like decry the obsidian.

14741
08:39:54,920 --> 08:39:59,600
He keeps giving me cry obsidian.

14742
08:40:00,300 --> 08:40:02,130
He keeps doing it!

14743
08:40:02,600 --> 08:40:03,620
He does!

14744
08:40:04,040 --> 08:40:04,840
He does!

14745
08:40:06,320 --> 08:40:08,220
You gotta fucking...

She's lost it.

14750
08:40:17,280 --> 08:40:18,380
She's lost it for real.

14751
08:40:20,160 --> 08:40:22,000
I can't hit him!

14752
08:40:24,920 --> 08:40:26,480
I can't hit him anymore.

14753
08:40:27,060 --> 08:40:28,120
You did it!

14754
08:40:28,220 --> 08:40:28,780
You did it!

14755
08:40:30,840 --> 08:40:32,200

14760
08:40:38,220 --> 08:40:40,300
There is an Enderman right behind you too.

Drop your pearls.

14767
08:40:49,300 --> 08:40:49,880
Poop them out.

14768
08:40:50,300 --> 08:40:51,020
Poop out your pearls.

14769
08:40:52,600 --> 08:40:53,920

Oh hi.

14774
08:41:03,580 --> 08:41:04,040
Oh my god.

14775
08:41:07,830 --> 08:41:09,520
I believe in us.

14776
08:41:10,700 --> 08:41:12,960
I can't believe I wanted to start later.

14777
08:41:13,420 --> 08:41:14,960
That's what I said earlier!

14778
08:41:16,260 --> 08:41:17,460
I can't believe it.

14779
08:41:17,460 --> 08:41:20,840
I was like are you... I thought I literally while you were gone I was like...

14780
08:41:20,840 --> 08:41:25,680
I really thought when she proposed this that she wanted to start in the morning and like go all day.

14781
08:41:26,020 --> 08:41:27,880
But no, you were like...

14782
08:41:27,880 --> 08:41:29,020
Oh shit!

14783
08:41:29,280 --> 08:41:29,780
Oh shit!

14784
08:41:29,940 --> 08:41:30,400
Oh my god.

14785
08:41:30,640 --> 08:41:30,960
Oh my god.

14786
08:41:31,020 --> 08:41:31,280
I'm dead.

14787
08:41:31,440 --> 08:41:31,860
I might be dead.

14788
08:41:31,920 --> 08:41:32,280
I might be dead.

14789
08:41:32,420 --> 08:41:32,900
I might be dead.

14790
08:41:33,080 --> 08:41:33,520
I might be dead.

14791
08:41:33,800 --> 08:41:34,280
Oh shit.

14792
08:41:34,420 --> 08:41:34,480
Shit.

14793
08:41:34,960 --> 08:41:34,960
No.

14794
08:41:36,020 --> 08:41:36,340
No.

14795
08:41:36,360 --> 08:41:36,520
No.

14796
08:41:36,520 --> 08:41:36,780
I'm ok.

14797
08:41:36,880 --> 08:41:37,160
I'm ok.

14798
08:41:37,660 --> 08:41:38,100
Where is he?

14799
08:41:38,560 --> 08:41:39,040
Where is he?

14800
08:41:39,240 --> 08:41:39,500
Hold on.

14801
08:41:39,860 --> 08:41:40,160
Hold on.

14802
08:41:40,300 --> 08:41:40,500
No.

14803
08:41:40,520 --> 08:41:40,780
I'm ok.

14804
08:41:40,780 --> 08:41:41,060
I'm ok.

14805
08:41:41,420 --> 08:41:41,720
I'm ok.

14806
08:41:42,780 --> 08:41:43,080
I'm ok.

14807
08:41:43,380 --> 08:41:43,680
I'm ok.

14808
08:41:43,680 --> 08:41:45,240
I dropped down.

14809
08:41:45,340 --> 08:41:46,240
I dropped down.

14810
08:41:46,340 --> 08:41:46,960
Are you ok?

14811
08:41:47,500 --> 08:41:47,720
Yeah.

14812
08:41:47,760 --> 08:41:48,160
I'm ok.

14813
08:41:48,340 --> 08:41:48,660
I'm ok.

14814
08:41:48,660 --> 08:41:49,760
I dropped down.

14815
08:41:49,980 --> 08:41:50,320
I'm ok.

14816
08:41:52,520 --> 08:41:53,520
What the fuck?

14817
08:41:53,860 --> 08:41:54,600
I'm not ok.

14818
08:41:54,760 --> 08:41:55,260
I'm not ok.

14819
08:41:55,440 --> 08:41:55,640
No.

14820
08:41:55,820 --> 08:41:55,860
No.

14821
08:41:55,940 --> 08:41:55,980
No.

14822
08:41:55,980 --> 08:41:56,960
I'm really not ok.

14823
08:41:57,120 --> 08:41:57,920
I'm really not ok.

14824
08:41:58,160 --> 08:41:59,040
I'm really not ok.

14825
08:42:00,280 --> 08:42:01,060
I'm not ok.

14826
08:42:01,120 --> 08:42:01,580
I'm not ok.

14827
08:42:01,620 --> 08:42:02,080
I'm not ok.

14828
08:42:02,180 --> 08:42:02,540
I'm not ok.

14829
08:42:02,740 --> 08:42:03,260
I'm not ok.

14830
08:42:03,420 --> 08:42:03,740
I'm not ok.

14831
08:42:04,040 --> 08:42:04,480
I'm not ok.

14832
08:42:06,000 --> 08:42:06,540
Climb up.

14833
08:42:06,620 --> 08:42:07,000
Climb up.

14834
08:42:07,140 --> 08:42:07,480
Climb up.

14835
08:42:07,760 --> 08:42:08,120
Shit.

14836
08:42:08,300 --> 08:42:08,440
Shit.

14837
08:42:08,640 --> 08:42:08,680
Shit.

14838
08:42:09,020 --> 08:42:09,020
Shit.

14839
08:42:09,880 --> 08:42:11,640
Oh no, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

14840
08:42:11,700 --> 08:42:12,060
I'm gonna die.

14841
08:42:13,080 --> 08:42:17,200
I got him, I got him!

14842
08:42:17,340 --> 08:42:18,980
Just heal, just heal.

14843
08:42:19,540 --> 08:42:20,340
Calm down!

14844
08:42:21,000 --> 08:42:22,420
Heal, heal, heal!

14845
08:42:22,760 --> 08:42:23,480
Calm down.

14846
08:42:23,540 --> 08:42:25,380
I'm calm, I'm calm!

14847
08:42:27,300 --> 08:42:28,600
That's why he attacked me.

14848
08:42:28,680 --> 08:42:29,920
I was like, I didn't hit him.

14849
08:42:29,980 --> 08:42:30,400
Why did he...

14850
08:42:30,400 --> 08:42:31,420
Don't have your helmet.

14851
08:42:31,740 --> 08:42:32,340
You got...

14852
08:42:32,340 --> 08:42:34,900
I know, I know, I know, it broke because of the Enderman.

14853
08:42:35,980 --> 08:42:37,180
Oh my God.

14854
08:42:39,020 --> 08:42:40,360
Oh my god!

14855
08:42:41,380 --> 08:42:43,000
What were your hearts?

14856
08:42:43,380 --> 08:42:44,000
What were your hearts?

14857
08:42:44,060 --> 08:42:46,340
I was at one and a half I think.

14858
08:42:46,580 --> 08:42:46,800
Oh!

14859
08:42:49,560 --> 08:42:51,920
I thought I was gonna die for real.

14860
08:42:52,440 --> 08:42:53,900
Oh my god!

14861
08:42:53,920 --> 08:42:54,740
Oh my god!

14862
08:42:54,740 --> 08:42:56,320
What happened to your house?

14863
08:42:57,420 --> 08:43:04,040
I went underneath and then I got shoved out by the pig because I wasn't wearing the gold.

14864
08:43:04,380 --> 08:43:05,420
Oh my god.

14865
08:43:05,880 --> 08:43:06,800
I'm healing you guys.

14866
08:43:06,800 --> 08:43:08,160
I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing.

14867
08:43:08,180 --> 08:43:09,980
That was like the PTSD right there.

14868
08:43:10,420 --> 08:43:11,920
It would've all been over.

14869
08:43:13,100 --> 08:43:15,960
All that gold I farmed...

14870
08:43:15,960 --> 08:43:16,500
It would've all been over.

14871
08:43:16,500 --> 08:43:18,240
All that gold I farmed...

14872
08:43:18,240 --> 08:43:20,160
It would've all been over.

14873
08:43:20,200 --> 08:43:21,340
Oh my god!

14874
08:43:21,720 --> 08:43:23,460
Oh my god!

14875
08:43:24,740 --> 08:43:26,440
Oh my god!

14876
08:43:26,440 --> 08:43:27,520
There's no more gold.

14877
08:43:27,760 --> 08:43:30,560
There's no more gold in the wall, in the ceiling.

14878
08:43:30,560 --> 08:43:31,120
Ok, come here Enderman.

14879
08:43:31,940 --> 08:43:33,280
Oh my god!

14880
08:43:33,720 --> 08:43:34,160
What?

14881
08:43:35,140 --> 08:43:35,700
Are you dead?

14882
08:43:35,920 --> 08:43:37,580
There's seven Endermans right here.

14883
08:43:38,160 --> 08:43:39,060
In the corner.

14884
08:43:39,220 --> 08:43:40,900
Wait, I think this is a good farm spot.

14885
08:43:41,500 --> 08:43:42,240
Get over here.

14886
08:43:42,420 --> 08:43:43,000
Ok, hold on.

14887
08:43:43,180 --> 08:43:44,100
I'm getting this guy.

14888
08:43:45,100 --> 08:43:48,440
There's seven Endermans right in the corner.

14889
08:43:48,480 --> 08:43:50,760
They hit so hard.

14890
08:43:50,820 --> 08:43:51,720
Oh, he gave me soup.

14891
08:43:52,540 --> 08:43:53,220
Thanks for the soup.

14892
08:43:53,960 --> 08:43:55,120
Oh my god, look at that.

14893
08:43:55,120 --> 08:43:57,120
Where are you?

14894
08:43:57,780 --> 08:43:58,600
Ok, I'll show you.

14895
08:43:58,600 --> 08:43:59,900
Alright, you gotta make a house.

14896
08:44:00,420 --> 08:44:01,940
Yeah, I'll make the house.

14897
08:44:02,180 --> 08:44:03,240
Just show me where.

14898
08:44:03,600 --> 08:44:05,300
Ok, come with me.

14899
08:44:05,380 --> 08:44:06,400
I'm coming, I'm right behind you.

14900
08:44:08,180 --> 08:44:09,000
Ok, this is a little dangerous.

14901
08:44:09,120 --> 08:44:09,760
No, no, don't go here.

14902
08:44:09,960 --> 08:44:11,500
We go up with rocks.

14903
08:44:11,800 --> 08:44:12,340
Ok, ok.

14904
08:44:16,920 --> 08:44:17,200
Ok.

14905
08:44:20,550 --> 08:44:20,990
How?

14906
08:44:21,290 --> 08:44:21,630
Here.

14907
08:44:23,610 --> 08:44:24,810
Ok, I'm coming.

14908
08:44:26,170 --> 08:44:27,430
Oh, just kidding.

14909
08:44:27,430 --> 08:44:28,070
Ok, here we go.

14910
08:44:28,430 --> 08:44:30,010
Here we go.

14911
08:44:30,210 --> 08:44:31,050
It's in this corner.

14912
08:44:31,330 --> 08:44:32,190
It's very scary.

14913
08:44:32,470 --> 08:44:33,690
Just a warning.

14914
08:44:33,910 --> 08:44:35,030
It's a very scary corner.

14915
08:44:35,450 --> 08:44:36,070
I'm ready.

14916
08:44:36,290 --> 08:44:36,890
I'm looking down.

14917
08:44:38,030 --> 08:44:39,610
When you're gonna see it, you're gonna be...

14918
08:44:39,610 --> 08:44:40,430
It's right in this corner.

14919
08:44:40,550 --> 08:44:43,910
Right over there in that corner to our left, you're gonna see seven Endermans.

14920
08:44:43,970 --> 08:44:44,610
Oh my god.

14921
08:44:45,630 --> 08:44:47,150
Oh my god, I see them.

14922
08:44:47,270 --> 08:44:48,170
What the hell?

14923
08:44:49,110 --> 08:44:50,330
Ok, I'm going over.

14924
08:44:51,650 --> 08:44:54,770
I don't know what they're doing over there, but there's a party.

14925
08:44:54,770 --> 08:44:56,430
I hear them.

14926
08:44:57,110 --> 08:44:58,190
I hear them.

14927
08:44:58,350 --> 08:44:59,530
What the hell is happening?

14928
08:45:02,070 --> 08:45:04,190
Bye, my diamond pickaxe.

14929
08:45:04,250 --> 08:45:05,390
Mine is almost dead too.

14930
08:45:05,570 --> 08:45:06,170
Wait, where are they?

14931
08:45:06,290 --> 08:45:07,390
Oh my god.

14932
08:45:07,750 --> 08:45:09,330
You scared me, Enderman.

14933
08:45:10,890 --> 08:45:13,050
Make sure you make your thing.

14934
08:45:13,990 --> 08:45:16,010
I'm trying to make my house, but...

14935
08:45:16,010 --> 08:45:17,510
I think we have to leave here.

14936
08:45:17,610 --> 08:45:20,250
There's no way to farm anymore gold.

14937
08:45:20,850 --> 08:45:21,830
Oh my god.

14938
08:45:21,830 --> 08:45:25,130
I just found the last remaining gold block.

14939
08:45:25,750 --> 08:45:28,030
The final gold block.

14940
08:45:28,530 --> 08:45:30,130
The final gold block.

14941
08:45:34,050 --> 08:45:38,090
Ok, now I'm safe.

14942
08:45:38,390 --> 08:45:38,490
Ok.

14943
08:45:39,350 --> 08:45:40,210
No, I shouldn't.

14944
08:45:40,370 --> 08:45:42,890
This is way too risky even for me.

14945
08:45:44,130 --> 08:45:44,610
Ok.

14946
08:45:49,970 --> 08:45:50,450
Oh!

14947
08:45:51,050 --> 08:45:52,870
I got seven ender pearls now.

14948
08:45:54,110 --> 08:45:55,210
From all that?

14949
08:45:55,390 --> 08:45:56,370
From all of those?

14950
08:45:56,490 --> 08:45:57,530
Oh, I only got one.

14951
08:45:58,590 --> 08:45:59,070
Ok.

14952
08:45:59,650 --> 08:46:02,410
I was going to say, there was a lot of guys in that corner.

14953
08:46:02,630 --> 08:46:04,430
I hear the guys, but I can't get to them.

14954
08:46:05,050 --> 08:46:06,030
Safely, at least.

14955
08:46:06,690 --> 08:46:07,630
And there's a ghast.

14956
08:46:07,770 --> 08:46:08,590
Of course there is.

14957
08:46:09,670 --> 08:46:10,150
Oh.

14958
08:46:10,150 --> 08:46:11,310
Goodbye.

14959
08:46:11,830 --> 08:46:12,950
Ok, I have 18.

14960
08:46:13,310 --> 08:46:13,950
Goodbye.

14961
08:46:15,550 --> 08:46:17,710
Oh, I hear another ghast to my left.

14962
08:46:18,490 --> 08:46:19,630
Yeah, he's there.

14963
08:46:20,590 --> 08:46:22,150
We gotta leave this area.

14964
08:46:22,370 --> 08:46:23,050
I mean, there's...

14965
08:46:23,050 --> 08:46:23,910
No.

14966
08:46:25,510 --> 08:46:25,990
Was that you?

14967
08:46:26,770 --> 08:46:29,610
My crafting table.

14968
08:46:32,130 --> 08:46:33,830
This guy sucks.

14969
08:46:33,930 --> 08:46:35,090
They suck so much.

14970
08:46:35,370 --> 08:46:37,170
My crafting table.

14971
08:46:37,170 --> 08:46:39,630
I shoot him to the left.

14972
08:46:40,010 --> 08:46:42,030
And then he got my table.

14973
08:46:42,070 --> 08:46:42,350
Again?

14974
08:46:43,630 --> 08:46:45,610
He destroyed it.

14975
08:46:46,470 --> 08:46:49,950
I literally just moved to the left.

14976
08:46:50,490 --> 08:46:51,170
To the right.

14977
08:46:51,330 --> 08:46:52,050
To the right.

14978
08:46:54,270 --> 08:46:54,950
Ok.

14979
08:46:55,970 --> 08:46:56,650
I...

14980
08:46:57,770 --> 08:46:59,030
Yeah, I see you.

14981
08:47:00,270 --> 08:47:01,310
I'm going down.

14982
08:47:01,430 --> 08:47:01,930
What do we do?

14983
08:47:02,310 --> 08:47:02,810
We leave?

14984
08:47:02,990 --> 08:47:05,810
I think we leave this cursed land.

14985
08:47:07,010 --> 08:47:07,450
We...

14986
08:47:08,330 --> 08:47:10,610
We leave this cursed land.

14987
08:47:10,770 --> 08:47:11,770
I can hear all of them.

14988
08:47:11,870 --> 08:47:13,150
I just can't see any of them.

14989
08:47:13,850 --> 08:47:14,650
For some reason.

14990
08:47:14,810 --> 08:47:16,270
Oh my gosh, there's another ghast.

14991
08:47:16,890 --> 08:47:17,670
How many?

14992
08:47:18,050 --> 08:47:19,450
Oh, there he is.

14993
08:47:20,710 --> 08:47:21,850
Why are they loud?

14994
08:47:22,650 --> 08:47:23,390
Oh my god.

14995
08:47:23,530 --> 08:47:24,270
You're killing them.

14996
08:47:25,950 --> 08:47:26,690
There you go.

14997
08:47:26,750 --> 08:47:27,490
One of them is dead.

14998
08:47:28,310 --> 08:47:29,390
Are you getting arrows?

14999
08:47:29,590 --> 08:47:30,310
Or are you getting...

15000
08:47:30,930 --> 08:47:34,250
I've been getting a lot.

15001
08:47:36,810 --> 08:47:37,860
Everything but obsidian.

15002
08:47:39,850 --> 08:47:40,450
Hey, whatever.

15003
08:47:40,590 --> 08:47:41,470
That was work, I guess.

15004
08:47:41,710 --> 08:47:43,810
We need them for the fight, so...

15005
08:47:45,210 --> 08:47:46,430
Oh, thank you for the boots.

15006
08:47:48,390 --> 08:47:49,650
We have to leave.

15007
08:47:49,750 --> 08:47:50,350
We leave.

15008
08:47:50,850 --> 08:47:51,430
Oh, ok.

15009
08:47:51,630 --> 08:47:51,890
Alright.

15010
08:47:52,090 --> 08:47:52,650
I think I can...

15011
08:47:53,350 --> 08:47:56,890
Thanks for the iron boots and the iron ingots, I guess.

15012
08:48:00,170 --> 08:48:00,590
Ok.

15013
08:48:01,170 --> 08:48:02,090
I got a guy.

15014
08:48:02,310 --> 08:48:03,410
I baited a guy in.

15015
08:48:03,410 --> 08:48:03,770
Alright.

15016
08:48:04,230 --> 08:48:06,310
Come on, guy.

15017
08:48:07,850 --> 08:48:08,370
Where did he go?

15018
08:48:11,490 --> 08:48:12,070
Oh my god.

15019
08:48:12,150 --> 08:48:13,130
Come back.

15020
08:48:13,410 --> 08:48:14,350
Come back, please.

15021
08:48:14,930 --> 08:48:16,070
Come back, please.

15022
08:48:19,250 --> 08:48:20,210
Oh my god.

15023
08:48:20,230 --> 08:48:21,170
It's almost 2AM!

15024
08:48:21,650 --> 08:48:22,610
No way.

15025
08:48:23,390 --> 08:48:24,450
We can do this.

15026
08:48:24,710 --> 08:48:28,890
We can do this.

15027
08:48:29,670 --> 08:48:31,510
We can do this.

15028
08:48:33,730 --> 08:48:35,090
Oh, there's another one?

15029
08:48:36,350 --> 08:48:37,590
The other angry?

15030
08:48:39,630 --> 08:48:41,070
Do I not need...

15031
08:48:41,070 --> 08:48:43,030
Do you want my stuff, little boy?

15032
08:48:43,390 --> 08:48:45,310
Do you want my little water bottle?

15033
08:48:45,910 --> 08:48:47,370
Do you want that, little boy?

15034
08:48:47,490 --> 08:48:48,730
Zoom over here, please.

15035
08:48:49,170 --> 08:48:51,150
Please, sir.

15036
08:48:51,990 --> 08:48:53,910
Why are you still here?

15037
08:48:54,390 --> 08:48:55,810
Why are you still...

15038
08:48:55,810 --> 08:48:56,930
We gotta leave.

15039
08:48:57,390 --> 08:48:57,970
Oh, here we go.

15040
08:48:58,330 --> 08:48:58,790
Oh my god.

15041
08:49:02,810 --> 08:49:03,210
Oh my god.

15042
08:49:03,210 --> 08:49:03,210
Yeah!

15043
08:49:03,390 --> 08:49:04,930
Oh my gosh, this is like an ender farm.

15044
08:49:05,530 --> 08:49:05,930
Yeah!

15045
08:49:09,190 --> 08:49:09,590
Yeah!

15046
08:49:09,590 --> 08:49:11,050
This is like an ender farm!

15047
08:49:11,750 --> 08:49:12,090
Yeah!

15048
08:49:13,150 --> 08:49:13,550
Yeah!

15049
08:49:14,110 --> 08:49:14,350
Yeah!

15050
08:49:15,610 --> 08:49:16,410
Oh my god.

15051
08:49:16,890 --> 08:49:17,630
This is kind of awesome.

15052
08:49:18,370 --> 08:49:19,370
Yeah, I found a little hole.

15053
08:49:19,790 --> 08:49:20,510
I found their hole.

15054
08:49:22,050 --> 08:49:23,750
I just hit them all at once.

15055
08:49:24,850 --> 08:49:26,770
Ok, I only got 2 pearls from that.

15056
08:49:26,770 --> 08:49:27,830
But, you know, great.

15057
08:49:28,270 --> 08:49:28,930
That's good.

15058
08:49:28,990 --> 08:49:29,650
Alright, let's leave.

15059
08:49:29,750 --> 08:49:30,210
Oh, hold on.

15060
08:49:30,510 --> 08:49:30,870
Come here.

15061
08:49:32,290 --> 08:49:33,750
There's 3 more over there.

15062
08:49:38,050 --> 08:49:39,110
Did I just hear you?

15063
08:49:41,170 --> 08:49:41,930
Oh, hi.

15064
08:49:43,310 --> 08:49:44,310
Where do you wanna go?

15065
08:49:45,250 --> 08:49:46,290
I don't know.

15066
08:49:46,670 --> 08:49:47,230
You pick.

15067
08:49:47,610 --> 08:49:48,250
I don't know.

15068
08:49:48,370 --> 08:49:49,770
I've been here so long.

15069
08:49:51,210 --> 08:49:54,010
I've been trading for gold non-stop.

15070
08:49:54,010 --> 08:49:56,190
Like, I don't know anymore.

15071
08:49:56,930 --> 08:50:01,290
Ok, I have another concern because we're gonna run out of food soon.

15072
08:50:01,470 --> 08:50:02,790
No, I have a lot of hay.

15073
08:50:03,010 --> 08:50:03,390
You do?

15074
08:50:03,590 --> 08:50:03,790
Ok.

15075
08:50:04,070 --> 08:50:05,070
I have 20 more.

15076
08:50:06,710 --> 08:50:07,950
That's a lot.

15077
08:50:08,550 --> 08:50:09,510
Like hay bales?

15078
08:50:09,990 --> 08:50:12,690
Yeah, I have 20 more.

15079
08:50:13,070 --> 08:50:15,750
I have 20 more hay bales!

15080
08:50:15,770 --> 08:50:16,730
Let's go!

15081
08:50:19,330 --> 08:50:20,770
I have melons?

15082
08:50:20,770 --> 08:50:23,170
Oh, I have 64 melons.

15083
08:50:23,250 --> 08:50:24,230
Ok, we're good.

15084
08:50:24,650 --> 08:50:25,990
I have a full stack of melons.

15085
08:50:26,050 --> 08:50:27,070
I didn't even notice them.

15086
08:50:28,930 --> 08:50:30,870
Do we wanna just go this way?

15087
08:50:31,250 --> 08:50:32,150
Alright, let's go.

15088
08:50:32,850 --> 08:50:34,550
Get some gold somewhere.

15089
08:50:35,590 --> 08:50:36,930
Maybe we'll get more here.

15090
08:50:37,010 --> 08:50:37,510
Who knows?

15091
08:50:45,450 --> 08:50:47,350
It's from an American tale.

15092
08:50:47,910 --> 08:50:49,350
The one about the mouse?

15093
08:50:49,350 --> 08:50:52,210
The one with the naked lady in the window, right?

15094
08:51:00,590 --> 08:51:03,150
That would suck if there was no cats in America.

15095
08:51:03,190 --> 08:51:05,290
I'd be really upset about that, actually.

15096
08:51:05,830 --> 08:51:07,030
It's a terrible song.

15097
08:51:07,150 --> 08:51:08,010
I hate these cats.

15098
08:51:08,190 --> 08:51:08,870
Or these mice.

15099
08:51:09,350 --> 08:51:10,010
You know what?

15100
08:51:10,310 --> 08:51:12,010
They can get eaten by the cats.

15101
08:51:12,210 --> 08:51:13,250
Oh, for all I care.

15102
08:51:15,550 --> 08:51:18,690
For the mice, you're supposed to represent the American dream.

15103
08:51:19,810 --> 08:51:23,370
Well, they're talking about no cats.

15104
08:51:24,530 --> 08:51:26,190
The cats are eating the mice!

15105
08:51:26,490 --> 08:51:28,430
The cats are the more important part!

15106
08:51:29,050 --> 08:51:30,490
Cats are cuter than mice.

15107
08:51:31,970 --> 08:51:34,550
That's some cat propaganda right there.

15108
08:51:38,970 --> 08:51:41,750
Why are you not, like, just mining the straight line?

15109
08:51:41,750 --> 08:51:44,050
Oh, the naked lady is in the...

15110
08:51:44,050 --> 08:51:47,750
Oh, no, the naked lady is in the Disney movie.

15111
08:51:49,010 --> 08:51:50,530
Yeah, the one frame where they're naked?

15112
08:51:51,230 --> 08:51:52,630
Oh, just go on a straight line?

15113
08:51:53,290 --> 08:51:54,530
Yeah, why are you, like...

15114
08:51:54,530 --> 08:51:57,390
I don't know, I was trying...

15115
08:51:57,390 --> 08:51:59,150
Yeah, that's the netherite mine.

15116
08:51:59,310 --> 08:51:59,710
Is it really?

15117
08:52:00,450 --> 08:52:03,210
Yeah, the way you were mining, that's how you mine for netherite.

15118
08:52:03,250 --> 08:52:05,070
Well, that's how I got to netherite, baby.

15119
08:52:05,750 --> 08:52:06,750
Not the gold.

15120
08:52:07,050 --> 08:52:08,530
I tried for the gold!

15121
08:52:08,530 --> 08:52:08,730
I tried for the gold!

15122
08:52:10,590 --> 08:52:12,530
But I also was just trying to...

15123
08:52:14,190 --> 08:52:15,610
Are you mining?

15124
08:52:17,530 --> 08:52:19,650
I thought that was mine that was breaking.

15125
08:52:20,610 --> 08:52:21,650
No, mine broke.

15126
08:52:22,730 --> 08:52:24,770
I've just been making iron ones.

15127
08:52:25,590 --> 08:52:27,070
Because I don't want to use my diamond.

15128
08:52:27,450 --> 08:52:28,450
But now I have to.

15129
08:52:29,730 --> 08:52:31,930
It's too late.

15130
08:52:32,230 --> 08:52:33,110
You have to.

15131
08:52:33,730 --> 08:52:34,870
But it's precious!

15132
08:52:34,870 --> 08:52:36,510
It's precious material!

15133
08:52:38,890 --> 08:52:39,910
We're in too deep.

15134
08:52:43,190 --> 08:52:44,990
That has to be an ender, right?

15135
08:52:45,690 --> 08:52:45,890
What?

15136
08:52:46,550 --> 08:52:47,210
The enderman?

15137
08:52:47,630 --> 08:52:49,470
No, I think that was just cave ambiance.

15138
08:52:51,150 --> 08:52:55,010
How deep is this hole and how is there no gold?

15139
08:52:55,750 --> 08:52:57,050
See, that's what I'm saying!

15140
08:52:57,790 --> 08:52:58,650
How is there no gold?

15141
08:52:58,930 --> 08:52:59,730
I don't know.

15142
08:52:59,950 --> 08:53:01,090
Do you need iron?

15143
08:53:01,210 --> 08:53:01,850
I have iron.

15144
08:53:01,850 --> 08:53:02,830
Oh, you do?

15145
08:53:04,050 --> 08:53:05,930
I shouldn't have just one iron.

15146
08:53:06,410 --> 08:53:07,350
Here, take it all.

15147
08:53:08,050 --> 08:53:09,090
Take it all.

15148
08:53:09,190 --> 08:53:10,250
Take all the iron.

15149
08:53:12,610 --> 08:53:15,010
Yeah, I kept the iron instead of the enderpearl.

15150
08:53:24,870 --> 08:53:26,730
I'm just gonna mine a straight line.

15151
08:53:26,930 --> 08:53:28,990
I'm not doing two anymore.

15152
08:53:29,230 --> 08:53:31,390
I'm not doing two anymore.

15153
08:53:31,990 --> 08:53:33,510
I'll do the other side.

15154
08:53:34,910 --> 08:53:36,090
I'll do the other side.

15155
08:53:36,090 --> 08:53:36,170
Oh!

15156
08:53:38,270 --> 08:53:39,030
What's up?

15157
08:53:39,130 --> 08:53:40,010
We're back.

15158
08:53:40,130 --> 08:53:40,290
Oh!

15159
08:53:40,530 --> 08:53:42,190
I see more...

15160
08:53:42,190 --> 08:53:43,950
I see more gold.

15161
08:53:44,490 --> 08:53:46,250
I see more gold.

15162
08:53:46,450 --> 08:53:47,730
More gold for you!

15163
08:53:48,610 --> 08:53:50,170
More gold for you!

15164
08:53:50,910 --> 08:53:51,990
I see it.

15165
08:53:52,070 --> 08:53:52,930
I see the gold.

15166
08:53:53,010 --> 08:53:53,830
She sees the gold.

15167
08:53:56,330 --> 08:53:58,310
Every gold is a gold.

15168
08:54:00,510 --> 08:54:02,550
The gold is the gold.

15169
08:54:03,030 --> 08:54:08,390
Maybe we should just slowly head back to our original spawn while we're trying to find gold.

15170
08:54:08,670 --> 08:54:10,530
It's like, who...what are we gonna get first?

15171
08:54:10,670 --> 08:54:12,350
Our original spawn point?

15172
08:54:13,230 --> 08:54:13,790
Or...

15173
08:54:13,790 --> 08:54:14,790
Or the gold?

15174
08:54:15,190 --> 08:54:17,550
At this rate, we would've been back.

15175
08:54:17,930 --> 08:54:19,810
We would've made it back.

15176
08:54:19,890 --> 08:54:22,010
I think we would've actually been back.

15177
08:54:22,450 --> 08:54:25,710
I honestly think...

15178
08:54:25,710 --> 08:54:27,470
I think we would've made it back.

15179
08:54:31,030 --> 08:54:33,290
Well, we're going in the opposite direction.

15180
08:54:34,430 --> 08:54:36,910
Alright, which direction is the gold?

15181
08:54:40,230 --> 08:54:41,350
Not gold, sorry.

15182
08:54:41,690 --> 08:54:42,090
The original.

15183
08:54:49,590 --> 08:54:52,970
Let's just slowly head back and see what we get first.

15184
08:54:53,030 --> 08:54:57,030
We need to literally go the opposite way that we just came from.

15185
08:54:57,970 --> 08:54:59,230
Alright, here we go.

15186
08:54:59,230 --> 08:55:00,030
Let's go!

15187
08:55:01,830 --> 08:55:02,270
Yippee!

15188
08:55:02,590 --> 08:55:03,330
Let's go!

15189
08:55:03,610 --> 08:55:05,090
I'm gonna follow you!

15190
08:55:05,350 --> 08:55:06,530
You aggroed a guy?

15191
08:55:07,030 --> 08:55:07,570
Or I did.

15192
08:55:07,790 --> 08:55:08,290
I don't think so.

15193
08:55:08,390 --> 08:55:09,190
Did I aggro him?

15194
08:55:09,350 --> 08:55:11,770
No, you did, because I wasn't looking at anything.

15195
08:55:11,990 --> 08:55:14,770
Oh, I was on...I was looking at the coordinates.

15196
08:55:15,110 --> 08:55:15,330
Okay.

15197
08:55:15,950 --> 08:55:16,490
My bad.

15198
08:55:17,470 --> 08:55:17,750
For me.

15199
08:55:17,770 --> 08:55:18,990
I was literally placing blocks.

15200
08:55:21,750 --> 08:55:22,530
Well, come on!

15201
08:55:23,650 --> 08:55:24,970
Are we not heading back?

15202
08:55:25,110 --> 08:55:26,890
I'm trying my best right now.

15203
08:55:26,890 --> 08:55:28,290
I'm worried I'm gonna fall.

15204
08:55:28,850 --> 08:55:30,610
Okay, I'm gonna dig while you do that.

15205
08:55:30,890 --> 08:55:31,650
And look for gold.

15206
08:55:33,030 --> 08:55:33,710
Alright, which way?

15207
08:55:33,810 --> 08:55:34,970
Which way is the original way?

15208
08:55:35,050 --> 08:55:35,590
This way!

15209
08:55:36,590 --> 08:55:38,170
Her smile and optimism.

15210
08:55:40,110 --> 08:55:42,990
But we have to also...hold on.

15211
08:55:44,110 --> 08:55:44,750
Okay, we...

15212
08:55:44,750 --> 08:55:47,350
It's more like...this way.

15213
08:55:47,810 --> 08:55:48,570
Negative Z.

15214
08:55:49,090 --> 08:55:51,370
It's like...okay, we gotta go facing north.

15215
08:55:51,690 --> 08:55:53,090
So we gotta go like this way.

15216
08:55:54,030 --> 08:55:54,750
This way?

15217
08:55:54,750 --> 08:55:55,570
Like a diagonal.

15218
08:55:56,350 --> 08:55:56,810
Okay.

15219
08:55:57,130 --> 08:55:59,390
So that's why the diagonal dig is good.

15220
08:56:00,430 --> 08:56:01,590
Do the diagonal dig.

15221
08:56:02,190 --> 08:56:03,430
Do the diagonal dig!

15222
08:56:03,450 --> 08:56:07,570
Then stand far away when you do the diagonal dig!

15223
08:56:08,610 --> 08:56:09,990
I wonder if I'm stupid.

15224
08:56:10,470 --> 08:56:11,130
Do you want me to dig?

15225
08:56:14,170 --> 08:56:15,250
Actually, no, yeah.

15226
08:56:15,850 --> 08:56:16,310
Okay.

15227
08:56:18,050 --> 08:56:19,310
I'm gonna be slower though.

15228
08:56:19,370 --> 08:56:20,310
I don't have a diamond pick.

15229
08:56:21,470 --> 08:56:22,430
I'm gonna...

15230
08:56:22,430 --> 08:56:24,070
It's just like 1% slower.

15231
08:56:25,190 --> 08:56:26,350
It's just 1%.

15232
08:56:26,350 --> 08:56:27,870
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit.

15233
08:56:30,450 --> 08:56:30,930
Okay.

15234
08:56:31,610 --> 08:56:32,310
I'll just...

15235
08:56:33,270 --> 08:56:34,310
I'll just dig.

15236
08:56:35,090 --> 08:56:35,990
I'll do it.

15237
08:56:36,010 --> 08:56:37,570
I'll just be the supervisor.

15238
08:56:38,190 --> 08:56:38,430
Yeah.

15239
08:56:39,590 --> 08:56:42,190
How am I doing, sir?

15240
08:56:43,050 --> 08:56:43,830
It's alright.

15241
08:56:44,250 --> 08:56:45,250
I mean, it could be better.

15242
08:56:45,730 --> 08:56:47,050
You know, you could put better form.

15243
08:56:47,050 --> 08:56:48,910
Can you like put torches down?

15244
08:56:49,950 --> 08:56:51,130
What's gonna happen?

15245
08:56:51,210 --> 08:56:52,210
Nothing's gonna spawn.

15246
08:56:52,410 --> 08:56:53,770
No, but I can't see.

15247
08:56:54,030 --> 08:56:54,970
You can't see?

15248
08:56:56,610 --> 08:56:59,490
You don't have the right resource pack.

15249
08:57:00,490 --> 08:57:02,410
I have the shaders on.

15250
08:57:05,050 --> 08:57:05,930
Oh my god.

15251
08:57:07,870 --> 08:57:09,350
Why are you tired?

15252
08:57:10,230 --> 08:57:12,030
It's 2am for me.

15253
08:57:12,390 --> 08:57:13,430
This is literally...

15254
08:57:13,430 --> 08:57:15,650
It was so fast in my bedtime.

15255
08:57:18,310 --> 08:57:19,710
Oh my god.

15256
08:57:19,770 --> 08:57:21,410
I told you it took 20 days.

15257
08:57:21,590 --> 08:57:22,650
And then we had one day.

15258
08:57:24,090 --> 08:57:25,530
Get your gamer subs out.

15259
08:57:25,630 --> 08:57:26,970
I got my gamer subs out.

15260
08:57:26,970 --> 08:57:28,730
I had the gamer subs earlier.

15261
08:57:29,330 --> 08:57:30,370
Get gamer subs out.

15262
08:57:30,430 --> 08:57:31,230
By the way, guys.

15263
08:57:31,910 --> 08:57:32,590
Code Boomer.

15264
08:57:33,230 --> 08:57:34,270
Code Doki Bird.

15265
08:57:35,670 --> 08:57:37,710
You can get 10% off.

15266
08:57:38,850 --> 08:57:41,450
My code will get you more percentage off.

15267
08:57:41,570 --> 08:57:42,430
Oh, I can't see.

15268
08:57:43,650 --> 08:57:44,030
What?

15269
08:57:45,330 --> 08:57:46,950
I need you to put down torches.

15270
08:57:47,410 --> 08:57:48,190
I can't see.

15271
08:57:50,650 --> 08:57:52,570
Why is there no gold in here?

15272
08:57:53,350 --> 08:57:55,550
I think we're not in the right...

15273
08:57:57,370 --> 08:57:58,350
Alright, get out.

15274
08:57:58,690 --> 08:57:59,610
It's my turn.

15275
08:57:59,970 --> 08:58:01,910
I'll make a new one and then I'll take over.

15276
08:58:04,510 --> 08:58:05,530
Oh, offhand it?

15277
08:58:05,610 --> 08:58:06,070
Oh, true.

15278
08:58:06,250 --> 08:58:06,690
Okay, yeah.

15279
08:58:06,770 --> 08:58:07,230
I'll do that.

15280
08:58:07,330 --> 08:58:08,230
It's just offhanding.

15281
08:58:08,270 --> 08:58:09,310
That's what I've been doing.

15282
08:58:10,370 --> 08:58:11,730
Well, other than the shield part.

15283
08:58:11,730 --> 08:58:12,170
Yeah.

15284
08:58:15,370 --> 08:58:16,810
Are we heading the right way?

15285
08:58:19,010 --> 08:58:20,530
Have you checked?

15286
08:58:20,950 --> 08:58:22,430
Yeah, we're heading the right way.

15287
08:58:22,690 --> 08:58:23,530
Okay, thank God.

15288
08:58:23,630 --> 08:58:27,090
We just need to get over a thousand...

15289
08:58:27,730 --> 08:58:28,070
Z.

15290
08:58:29,490 --> 08:58:31,750
And two thousand X.

15291
08:58:32,470 --> 08:58:33,070
Okay.

15292
08:58:33,490 --> 08:58:35,650
But we're also searching for gold.

15293
08:58:35,850 --> 08:58:36,750
So that we can...

15294
08:58:36,750 --> 08:58:38,930
Oh my God.

15295
08:58:38,930 --> 08:58:39,150
Oh my God.

15296
08:58:39,890 --> 08:58:40,910
What's happening?

15297
08:58:41,950 --> 08:58:43,510
Don't take down.

15298
08:58:46,470 --> 08:58:47,710
That's unpredictable.

15299
08:58:48,670 --> 08:58:49,590
Wait, is there lava?

15300
08:58:50,210 --> 08:58:50,890
Boat time.

15301
08:58:51,290 --> 08:58:53,770
I heard a gas though.

15302
08:58:54,430 --> 08:58:54,930
I think it's okay.

15303
08:58:55,090 --> 08:58:56,130
Boat time!

15304
08:58:57,030 --> 08:58:58,590
She doesn't care anymore.

15305
08:58:59,230 --> 08:59:00,510
Boat time!

15306
08:59:00,870 --> 08:59:01,830
Let's go!

15307
08:59:04,910 --> 08:59:05,670
Yay!

15308
08:59:05,670 --> 08:59:05,750
Yay!

15309
08:59:07,310 --> 08:59:08,150
Thank God.

15310
08:59:09,030 --> 08:59:12,070
Every time it really feels like the next time we will miss.

15311
08:59:15,070 --> 08:59:15,910
Goodbye boat!

15312
08:59:16,850 --> 08:59:17,950
Why does the Enderman scream?

15313
08:59:18,530 --> 08:59:18,930
Hold on.

15314
08:59:19,050 --> 08:59:19,390
Oh my God.

15315
08:59:19,510 --> 08:59:19,690
Wait.

15316
08:59:20,250 --> 08:59:20,790
Oh, shit.

15317
08:59:22,230 --> 08:59:23,290
I'm getting aggro.

15318
08:59:23,410 --> 08:59:24,390
I didn't aggro anybody.

15319
08:59:24,710 --> 08:59:26,510
I think it's the guy from before.

15320
08:59:27,630 --> 08:59:28,910
Did you aggro?

15321
08:59:29,890 --> 08:59:30,610
Did you do it?

15322
08:59:30,630 --> 08:59:32,550
No, I think it's the guy who followed us.

15323
08:59:32,550 --> 08:59:34,230
Did you do it?

15324
08:59:34,230 --> 08:59:35,430
No, I didn't do it.

15325
08:59:35,750 --> 08:59:36,710
Did you aggro?

15326
08:59:37,050 --> 08:59:38,310
I did, but earlier.

15327
08:59:38,890 --> 08:59:40,550
He followed me all the way here.

15328
08:59:42,610 --> 08:59:43,950
Just come down here.

15329
08:59:44,070 --> 08:59:44,930
No, he's gonna get me.

15330
08:59:45,010 --> 08:59:45,670
He's gonna get me.

15331
08:59:46,510 --> 08:59:50,750
He's not gonna get you.

15332
08:59:50,830 --> 08:59:51,990
You're being paranoid.

15333
08:59:52,510 --> 08:59:53,910
I hear him right there.

15334
08:59:54,190 --> 08:59:55,430
You're getting paranoid.

15335
08:59:56,170 --> 08:59:58,410
I'm gonna dig for gold while he's...

15336
08:59:58,410 --> 08:59:59,970
Until he comes to see me.

15337
08:59:59,970 --> 09:00:01,530
You're getting paranoid.

15338
09:00:01,530 --> 09:00:02,470
How am I paranoid?

15339
09:00:02,690 --> 09:00:04,230
I almost died to Enderman earlier.

15340
09:00:05,150 --> 09:00:06,710
You're getting paranoid.

15341
09:00:07,490 --> 09:00:09,550
You're hearing the voices again.

15342
09:00:09,570 --> 09:00:10,690
What are you talking about?

15343
09:00:10,770 --> 09:00:11,930
He's right there.

15344
09:00:12,370 --> 09:00:13,730
He's not angry.

15345
09:00:13,970 --> 09:00:14,750
Which one?

15346
09:00:15,010 --> 09:00:16,290
I hear him screaming.

15347
09:00:16,610 --> 09:00:19,090
Where are you?

15348
09:00:19,810 --> 09:00:20,570
I'm up here.

15349
09:00:20,710 --> 09:00:21,170
I hid.

15350
09:00:21,250 --> 09:00:23,150
As soon as I heard him screaming at me.

15351
09:00:23,370 --> 09:00:24,830
There's nobody screaming.

15352
09:00:25,370 --> 09:00:26,510
There's no one screaming.

15353
09:00:26,510 --> 09:00:27,530
There's nobody screaming.

15354
09:00:27,730 --> 09:00:29,150
You guys, you hear it.

15355
09:00:29,210 --> 09:00:30,490
He's underneath me.

15356
09:00:31,550 --> 09:00:32,790
Nobody is screaming.

15357
09:00:32,950 --> 09:00:34,530
I'm literally...

15358
09:00:34,530 --> 09:00:35,870
No one's getting you.

15359
09:00:35,990 --> 09:00:36,970
You're paranoid.

15360
09:00:41,810 --> 09:00:43,610
Oh, I see.

15361
09:00:43,690 --> 09:00:44,130
Never mind.

15362
09:00:44,230 --> 09:00:44,990
I see him now.

15363
09:00:46,570 --> 09:00:48,510
He was literally right...

15364
09:00:49,710 --> 09:00:49,950
Right...

15365
09:00:49,950 --> 09:00:51,750
He is vibrating.

15366
09:00:52,130 --> 09:00:52,710
I know.

15367
09:00:53,070 --> 09:00:54,210
I hear him.

15368
09:00:54,210 --> 09:00:56,130
What did you do to him?

15369
09:00:56,150 --> 09:00:56,410
Stop!

15370
09:00:56,810 --> 09:00:57,570
You're wasting your arrows.

15371
09:00:59,370 --> 09:01:00,250
He'll dodge.

15372
09:01:02,590 --> 09:01:04,230
I'm just waiting for him to come up here.

15373
09:01:04,230 --> 09:01:04,710
I wanted him to TP.

15374
09:01:05,430 --> 09:01:06,890
Oh, you wanted him to TP.

15375
09:01:08,690 --> 09:01:09,390
Hey, buddy!

15376
09:01:11,590 --> 09:01:12,410
Hey, buddy!

15377
09:01:15,590 --> 09:01:16,690
Why don't you kill him?

15378
09:01:17,130 --> 09:01:17,710
You're right there.

15379
09:01:17,830 --> 09:01:19,230
I'm trying to make the house!

15380
09:01:19,230 --> 09:01:20,090
Oh, okay.

15381
09:01:22,230 --> 09:01:23,470
Just right above your head.

15382
09:01:25,190 --> 09:01:26,570
Alright, there's three.

15383
09:01:26,590 --> 09:01:28,670
There's three Endermans right here.

15384
09:01:29,410 --> 09:01:31,710
Well, just kill the one that's aggro on me.

15385
09:01:32,390 --> 09:01:33,530
There's so many!

15386
09:01:33,650 --> 09:01:34,270
There's four!

15387
09:01:35,610 --> 09:01:36,830
Okay, but you're in the house.

15388
09:01:36,910 --> 09:01:37,570
You're safe.

15389
09:01:38,310 --> 09:01:39,050
Am I?

15390
09:01:39,110 --> 09:01:40,870
I don't know if I made it correctly.

15391
09:01:41,270 --> 09:01:42,190
Come down here.

15392
09:01:44,930 --> 09:01:45,730
I see him.

15393
09:01:45,730 --> 09:01:46,870
I see him.

15394
09:01:47,450 --> 09:01:47,970
I got him.

15395
09:01:48,430 --> 09:01:49,170
He's dead.

15396
09:01:50,470 --> 09:01:51,230
He's dead.

15397
09:01:51,630 --> 09:01:51,930
Okay.

15398
09:01:52,990 --> 09:01:54,810
I don't hear him screaming at me anymore.

15399
09:01:54,950 --> 09:01:55,770
Alright, I'm coming down.

15400
09:01:56,490 --> 09:01:59,330
We can kill all these other Endermans in this house I made.

15401
09:01:59,550 --> 09:02:00,170
Yeah, come here.

15402
09:02:01,550 --> 09:02:02,110
Oh my god.

15403
09:02:03,990 --> 09:02:05,050
Nice house, I think.

15404
09:02:05,630 --> 09:02:07,210
He brought the whole crew.

15405
09:02:07,390 --> 09:02:08,770
What was I supposed to do?

15406
09:02:09,690 --> 09:02:10,890
Okay, I killed one.

15407
09:02:12,090 --> 09:02:12,970
Where's the rest of them?

15408
09:02:12,970 --> 09:02:14,650
Where's the 500?

15409
09:02:14,690 --> 09:02:16,830
I'm literally looking at...

15410
09:02:18,070 --> 09:02:19,050
Get under the house!

15411
09:02:19,170 --> 09:02:19,950
Get under the house!

15412
09:02:21,010 --> 09:02:22,070
Further, further!

15413
09:02:22,970 --> 09:02:24,370
Was he going to hit me?

15414
09:02:24,650 --> 09:02:24,950
Yeah.

15415
09:02:26,270 --> 09:02:27,630
Alright, there's the other one.

15416
09:02:28,430 --> 09:02:29,530
Wasn't there like 50?

15417
09:02:30,450 --> 09:02:31,330
Right here!

15418
09:02:31,470 --> 09:02:32,510
I'm looking at the other one!

15419
09:02:34,470 --> 09:02:35,630
There he is!

15420
09:02:35,830 --> 09:02:36,290
He's coming!

15421
09:02:37,830 --> 09:02:38,570
Where is he?

15422
09:02:38,630 --> 09:02:39,270
Where is he going?

15423
09:02:39,270 --> 09:02:40,310
Yeah, where is he?

15424
09:02:40,530 --> 09:02:42,070
Oh, there he is.

15425
09:02:42,910 --> 09:02:44,430
Oh my god.

15426
09:02:44,570 --> 09:02:46,570
I told you he brought the whole crew!

15427
09:02:48,070 --> 09:02:49,690
I'm getting him!

15428
09:02:50,150 --> 09:02:50,750
Where did he go?

15429
09:02:51,930 --> 09:02:53,390
I saw the boat in the tree.

15430
09:02:54,310 --> 09:02:54,690
Yeah, I know.

15431
09:02:54,730 --> 09:02:55,450
I think there's the boat.

15432
09:02:55,730 --> 09:02:55,950
Yeah.

15433
09:02:56,530 --> 09:02:57,750
Is he going to come back?

15434
09:02:58,950 --> 09:03:00,270
I don't know, but I got the boat.

15435
09:03:00,610 --> 09:03:01,350
Hello, Enderman!

15436
09:03:01,970 --> 09:03:03,090
Where did he go?

15437
09:03:05,050 --> 09:03:05,630
Hey, buddy.

15438
09:03:06,010 --> 09:03:06,430
Come here.

15439
09:03:06,430 --> 09:03:07,230
He disappeared.

15440
09:03:11,570 --> 09:03:12,250
Oh my god.

15441
09:03:13,670 --> 09:03:15,110
Oh, that works too, I guess.

15442
09:03:17,630 --> 09:03:18,530
That works too.

15443
09:03:19,190 --> 09:03:20,670
I told you to get under the house!

15444
09:03:21,430 --> 09:03:22,170
I keep trying!

15445
09:03:26,400 --> 09:03:28,120
I have 500 pearls.

15446
09:03:28,500 --> 09:03:29,120
My shield?

15447
09:03:29,240 --> 09:03:29,800
I'll be okay.

15448
09:03:31,280 --> 09:03:33,580
Well, I guess we're not in the thing anymore, so...

15449
09:03:33,580 --> 09:03:34,860
Alright, tell me how to...

15450
09:03:34,860 --> 09:03:35,380
Where do we go?

15451
09:03:35,440 --> 09:03:36,820
How do we get to the other side?

15452
09:03:37,180 --> 09:03:38,800
Just keep heading north.

15453
09:03:39,980 --> 09:03:41,900
Yeah, we gotta go into those woods.

15454
09:03:42,640 --> 09:03:44,300
Back to the woods we go.

15455
09:03:44,420 --> 09:03:45,160
Into the thick of it.

15456
09:03:45,180 --> 09:03:46,120
Into the thick of it.

15457
09:03:46,780 --> 09:03:50,240
There was one guy I still hadn't killed though.

15458
09:03:50,600 --> 09:03:51,920
I wonder where he's at.

15459
09:03:52,360 --> 09:03:52,980
It's fine.

15460
09:03:54,080 --> 09:03:56,260
He's not gonna get revenge on us, right?

15461
09:03:57,260 --> 09:03:58,000
Where are my mushrooms?

15462
09:03:58,140 --> 09:03:59,420
I don't have any mushrooms, by the way.

15463
09:03:59,420 --> 09:04:00,000
I have mushrooms.

15464
09:04:00,900 --> 09:04:03,620
Wait, we're literally in mushroom territory.

15465
09:04:03,780 --> 09:04:04,120
Collect some.

15466
09:04:04,640 --> 09:04:05,700
I know, I know.

15467
09:04:06,140 --> 09:04:07,560
I need to find some.

15468
09:04:07,560 --> 09:04:08,700
Turn around.

15469
09:04:08,860 --> 09:04:09,180
Over here.

15470
09:04:09,380 --> 09:04:12,360
In here.

15471
09:04:13,240 --> 09:04:14,100
I found it.

15472
09:04:15,500 --> 09:04:16,660
But not the red ones.

15473
09:04:16,780 --> 09:04:17,740
You gotta get the blue ones.

15474
09:04:18,080 --> 09:04:18,380
I know.

15475
09:04:18,480 --> 09:04:19,840
I need to figure out what to throw away.

15476
09:04:20,520 --> 09:04:21,580
Into the thick of it.

15477
09:04:21,660 --> 09:04:22,480
Into the thick of it.

15478
09:04:23,300 --> 09:04:25,740
Here, I'll collect some and then I can give you like half or something.

15479
09:04:26,040 --> 09:04:26,540
Nah, it's fine.

15480
09:04:26,580 --> 09:04:27,060
I got two.

15481
09:04:27,540 --> 09:04:28,260
I got five.

15482
09:04:28,380 --> 09:04:28,740
I got five.

15483
09:04:28,880 --> 09:04:29,600
I got enough.

15484
09:04:30,220 --> 09:04:31,100
Alright, let's go.

15485
09:04:31,520 --> 09:04:33,480
I have 15.

15486
09:04:36,820 --> 09:04:37,540
Alright, that's...

15487
09:04:37,540 --> 09:04:37,760
What?

15488
09:04:39,080 --> 09:04:43,160
Now I'm being punished for being over prepared.

15489
09:04:43,700 --> 09:04:44,000
Yes.

15490
09:04:48,180 --> 09:04:50,800
Alright, do we just go straight?

15491
09:04:50,920 --> 09:04:51,460
Is that it?

15492
09:04:51,580 --> 09:04:52,600
Wait, where did you go?

15493
09:04:52,900 --> 09:04:53,700
Where did you go?

15494
09:04:54,200 --> 09:04:54,740
Oh, there you are.

15495
09:04:54,800 --> 09:04:55,620
I'm in the forest.

15496
09:04:56,220 --> 09:04:56,780
Oh, I see you.

15497
09:04:58,400 --> 09:04:59,120
How did you get...

15498
09:04:59,120 --> 09:05:00,280
Oh, you went that way.

15499
09:05:00,360 --> 09:05:00,720
That's right.

15500
09:05:01,780 --> 09:05:02,580
You're waiting.

15501
09:05:04,080 --> 09:05:04,620
I'm coming.

15502
09:05:04,620 --> 09:05:05,720
Into the thick of it.

15503
09:05:05,740 --> 09:05:07,840
I wish we could obtain that strider.

15504
09:05:08,020 --> 09:05:09,460
Oh, I should get out of saddle.

15505
09:05:09,680 --> 09:05:11,120
We don't need a str...

15506
09:05:11,120 --> 09:05:14,740
We could have just walked through the lava until we got to our place.

15507
09:05:14,920 --> 09:05:16,620
We could have...

15508
09:05:18,880 --> 09:05:22,240
But then the ghast would see us in the middle and blow us up.

15509
09:05:23,200 --> 09:05:24,080
Alright, let's...

15510
09:05:24,080 --> 09:05:24,740
Is it just straight?

15511
09:05:26,320 --> 09:05:28,620
It's more like...

15512
09:05:29,380 --> 09:05:29,980
Hold on.

15513
09:05:30,100 --> 09:05:31,400
I have to check when I move.

15514
09:05:34,620 --> 09:05:34,780
Wait.

15515
09:05:36,880 --> 09:05:37,440
Huh?

15516
09:05:38,220 --> 09:05:40,140
There's like four of them right below me.

15517
09:05:41,080 --> 09:05:42,700
Wait, but X is going up.

15518
09:05:44,380 --> 09:05:44,880
Okay, no.

15519
09:05:44,960 --> 09:05:45,480
It is straight.

15520
09:05:45,760 --> 09:05:46,920
Okay, okay.

15521
09:05:47,060 --> 09:05:47,640
I was gonna...

15522
09:05:47,640 --> 09:05:49,240
Yeah, let's just go straight.

15523
09:05:49,500 --> 09:05:49,980
Okay.

15524
09:05:53,320 --> 09:05:55,660
Just follow my one side bridge.

15525
09:05:55,740 --> 09:05:57,100
My one block bridge.

15526
09:05:57,500 --> 09:05:59,060
My one block bridge.

15527
09:05:59,160 --> 09:05:59,980
Right here.

15528
09:06:01,240 --> 09:06:02,700
Into the thick of it.

15529
09:06:02,700 --> 09:06:04,420
Into the thick of it.

15530
09:06:04,920 --> 09:06:05,900
Into the thick of it.

15531
09:06:07,760 --> 09:06:08,900
Look at this.

15532
09:06:09,860 --> 09:06:10,160
No.

15533
09:06:12,340 --> 09:06:13,720
Nothing in the ceilings either.

15534
09:06:14,740 --> 09:06:15,360
What the hell?

15535
09:06:15,940 --> 09:06:16,460
Stingy.

15536
09:06:17,220 --> 09:06:17,940
Oh, there's some gold.

15537
09:06:18,800 --> 09:06:19,060
Where?

15538
09:06:19,420 --> 09:06:20,120
Below you.

15539
09:06:20,400 --> 09:06:21,000
Okay, I'll get it.

15540
09:06:22,480 --> 09:06:24,440
I'm looking above me right now.

15541
09:06:24,940 --> 09:06:26,440
Alright, we go straight, right?

15542
09:06:27,160 --> 09:06:28,300
Yeah, but hold on.

15543
09:06:28,360 --> 09:06:30,400
Alright, digging forward.

15544
09:06:30,400 --> 09:06:31,800
Hold on, let me get the...

15545
09:06:31,800 --> 09:06:33,940
I'll put torches next to the hole.

15546
09:06:34,180 --> 09:06:34,400
Okay.

15547
09:06:36,400 --> 09:06:36,940
Oh, no.

15548
09:06:37,200 --> 09:06:37,460
Uh-oh.

15549
09:06:37,900 --> 09:06:38,440
Don't be mad.

15550
09:06:38,640 --> 09:06:39,060
Don't be mad.

15551
09:06:39,080 --> 09:06:39,420
I'm sorry.

15552
09:06:39,900 --> 09:06:40,980
You have gold on you.

15553
09:06:41,900 --> 09:06:42,340
Oh, shit.

15554
09:06:42,380 --> 09:06:42,960
He's mad at me.

15555
09:06:44,120 --> 09:06:46,540
Place blocks in front of it.

15556
09:06:46,740 --> 09:06:48,700
Get over here and place a block in front of it.

15557
09:06:49,760 --> 09:06:51,160
Okay, or place blocks in front of him.

15558
09:06:51,240 --> 09:06:51,980
I mean, that works too.

15559
09:06:52,900 --> 09:06:54,660
He's still trying to get me, but...

15560
09:06:54,660 --> 09:06:55,720
Get over here.

15561
09:06:56,000 --> 09:06:56,440
I'm coming.

15562
09:06:56,440 --> 09:06:58,020
Close the door.

15563
09:06:58,140 --> 09:06:58,840
Close the door.

15564
09:07:02,240 --> 09:07:03,280
Okay, straight, right?

15565
09:07:06,760 --> 09:07:08,280
I'm just gonna go straight for now.

15566
09:07:08,780 --> 09:07:09,900
For now is fine.

15567
09:07:10,540 --> 09:07:12,900
We're gonna have to...

15568
09:07:14,280 --> 09:07:15,200
change direction.

15569
09:07:15,780 --> 09:07:16,240
Okay.

15570
09:07:16,780 --> 09:07:17,540
Well, no.

15571
09:07:17,760 --> 09:07:18,420
I think it's...

15572
09:07:18,420 --> 09:07:18,900
Wait, no.

15573
09:07:19,160 --> 09:07:20,300
Well, I don't know.

15574
09:07:20,340 --> 09:07:21,080
It's so hard.

15575
09:07:21,180 --> 09:07:21,840
I hate this.

15576
09:07:21,960 --> 09:07:22,860
I hate navigating.

15577
09:07:24,720 --> 09:07:26,560
But we are going in the correct Z.

15578
09:07:26,560 --> 09:07:28,580
We just have to also...

15579
09:07:28,580 --> 09:07:30,500
But what about the X?

15580
09:07:30,920 --> 09:07:32,690
The X is like the biggest one...

15581
09:07:33,140 --> 09:07:34,560
that we're gonna have issues with.

15582
09:07:34,620 --> 09:07:36,460
Oh my god.

15583
09:07:37,940 --> 09:07:39,100
I'm too sick of it.

15584
09:07:39,160 --> 09:07:39,620
Here we go.

15585
09:07:40,000 --> 09:07:41,880
This is why we...

15586
09:07:42,450 --> 09:07:44,420
This is why we...

15587
09:07:44,420 --> 09:07:45,980
should have just...

15588
09:07:45,980 --> 09:07:47,320
got straighted.

15589
09:07:50,960 --> 09:07:52,180
We got...

15590
09:07:52,180 --> 09:07:54,060
I think I did a hundred gold pieces.

15591
09:07:54,060 --> 09:07:54,800
I...

15592
09:07:54,800 --> 09:07:57,880
I think I've done a hundred.

15593
09:07:58,160 --> 09:08:00,420
Yeah, but we only needed two more.

15594
09:08:01,300 --> 09:08:02,840
I've done a hundred.

15595
09:08:03,040 --> 09:08:04,640
We've only needed two more.

15596
09:08:04,640 --> 09:08:05,420
I've done a hundred.

15597
09:08:05,420 --> 09:08:06,440
We only needed two more.

15598
09:08:06,440 --> 09:08:08,740
I've done a hundred rolls.

15599
09:08:10,420 --> 09:08:12,060
We only needed two more.

15600
09:08:12,180 --> 09:08:13,520
What was this about?

15601
09:08:13,720 --> 09:08:14,660
You gave up.

15602
09:08:15,360 --> 09:08:16,580
Gamblers give up.

15603
09:08:17,460 --> 09:08:18,900
What was this?

15604
09:08:19,320 --> 09:08:22,240
We're doing it while we explore.

15605
09:08:24,060 --> 09:08:25,800
I almost just got killed...

15606
09:08:25,800 --> 09:08:28,480
for trying to...

15607
09:08:28,480 --> 09:08:29,820
Okay, so that's why...

15608
09:08:29,820 --> 09:08:32,040
when people are like, oh, just go one way...

15609
09:08:32,040 --> 09:08:33,020
and then go another way.

15610
09:08:33,100 --> 09:08:34,360
It doesn't really work in the nether...

15611
09:08:34,360 --> 09:08:36,080
because the nether is really special...

15612
09:08:36,080 --> 09:08:37,800
and just makes you have to...

15613
09:08:37,800 --> 09:08:38,740
reroute everything.

15614
09:08:39,640 --> 09:08:40,580
I think we... Hold on.

15615
09:08:40,800 --> 09:08:41,040
I'm checking.

15616
09:08:41,200 --> 09:08:43,060
Look at all those striders over there.

15617
09:08:43,300 --> 09:08:46,540
Look at all those striders just chilling in the fire.

15618
09:08:47,200 --> 09:08:48,500
We need to go this way.

15619
09:08:49,060 --> 09:08:49,860
Which way?

15620
09:08:50,020 --> 09:08:50,560
This way.

15621
09:08:50,560 --> 09:08:51,560
This way?

15622
09:08:52,220 --> 09:08:53,900
Okay, here we go.

15623
09:08:54,360 --> 09:08:56,480
Let's hope there's no ghastlies here.

15624
09:08:59,900 --> 09:09:02,320
I'm holding down my ship.

15625
09:09:02,420 --> 09:09:05,020
Let's hope my ship doesn't accidentally...

15626
09:09:05,020 --> 09:09:05,920
broke at the end.

15627
09:09:06,460 --> 09:09:07,880
That would be very...

15628
09:09:07,880 --> 09:09:08,720
That would be crazy.

15629
09:09:09,220 --> 09:09:09,860
Okay, I'm checking.

15630
09:09:10,520 --> 09:09:11,760
I'm drinking this.

15631
09:09:11,840 --> 09:09:13,220
You have another potion!

15632
09:09:14,260 --> 09:09:15,300
I'm drinking this.

15633
09:09:15,340 --> 09:09:16,360
I don't trust it.

15634
09:09:16,360 --> 09:09:16,900
I...

15635
09:09:16,900 --> 09:09:19,740
I can do this for three minutes.

15636
09:09:20,080 --> 09:09:21,040
Okay, yeah.

15637
09:09:21,300 --> 09:09:22,120
I'll just...

15638
09:09:22,120 --> 09:09:24,540
I'll just chill until we get to the other side.

15639
09:09:25,760 --> 09:09:28,400
You are the one that has the most...

15640
09:09:28,400 --> 09:09:32,640
I can do this for three minutes.

15641
09:09:32,960 --> 09:09:35,040
Are we going the right way?

15642
09:09:35,680 --> 09:09:36,040
Yeah.

15643
09:09:36,200 --> 09:09:37,380
Just to be sure.

15644
09:09:37,760 --> 09:09:38,820
Positive X.

15645
09:09:38,940 --> 09:09:40,400
Towards positive X.

15646
09:09:41,360 --> 09:09:42,280
Mr. X.

15647
09:09:42,580 --> 09:09:43,540
Gonna give it to you.

15648
09:09:43,540 --> 09:09:45,760
Is that a guy riding a strider down there?

15649
09:09:45,880 --> 09:09:48,040
We should kick him off.

15650
09:09:48,200 --> 09:09:49,600
Wait, you could do that.

15651
09:09:49,660 --> 09:09:50,520
You could drop...

15652
09:09:50,520 --> 09:09:52,100
I'm not gonna drop down!

15653
09:09:52,120 --> 09:09:53,540
You have the potion!

15654
09:09:54,120 --> 09:09:55,900
You have the potion!

15655
09:09:59,160 --> 09:10:00,960
He has a saddle on him!

15656
09:10:01,220 --> 09:10:04,360
We have other priorities right now!

15657
09:10:05,220 --> 09:10:07,100
You could do it!

15658
09:10:08,400 --> 09:10:11,300
You could steal that strider from him!

15659
09:10:11,300 --> 09:10:13,840
We have other priorities here!

15660
09:10:13,920 --> 09:10:15,480
We don't even have a saddle!

15661
09:10:15,740 --> 09:10:17,280
We don't even have a saddle.

15662
09:10:17,680 --> 09:10:18,560
We don't have a saddle.

15663
09:10:18,560 --> 09:10:21,800
That's why I'm saying you take the one from the guy riding it.

15664
09:10:22,020 --> 09:10:22,300
Where?

15665
09:10:22,880 --> 09:10:23,560
He's down there.

15666
09:10:23,700 --> 09:10:24,700
He doesn't even have a saddle.

15667
09:10:25,960 --> 09:10:27,280
He's just on top of it.

15668
09:10:27,500 --> 09:10:28,260
He's just chilling.

15669
09:10:29,140 --> 09:10:30,700
He's just chilling.

15670
09:10:31,260 --> 09:10:33,160
He doesn't even have his own.

15671
09:10:33,400 --> 09:10:34,520
I have more.

15672
09:10:34,880 --> 09:10:36,280
I have more.

15673
09:10:37,400 --> 09:10:39,120
My hand is cramping.

15674
09:10:39,120 --> 09:10:42,680
I'm pressing down the key.

15675
09:10:42,880 --> 09:10:43,900
We made it!

15676
09:10:44,300 --> 09:10:46,520
We actually made it!

15677
09:10:47,420 --> 09:10:48,240
Watch out!

15678
09:10:50,200 --> 09:10:51,160
Did you have your mushrooms?

15679
09:10:51,840 --> 09:10:53,580
No, I have them.

15680
09:10:56,340 --> 09:10:56,900
Back!

15681
09:10:57,520 --> 09:10:58,320
Back, beast!

15682
09:10:59,480 --> 09:11:00,760
Which way do we go?

15683
09:11:01,180 --> 09:11:04,240
When I put one down, when we get a little ways away...

15684
09:11:04,240 --> 09:11:06,100
Grab the old one, you know?

15685
09:11:06,640 --> 09:11:07,460
Back, beast!

15686
09:11:07,460 --> 09:11:08,340
Back, beast!

15687
09:11:08,540 --> 09:11:09,800
Now they're starting to attack him.

15688
09:11:09,860 --> 09:11:10,060
Nice.

15689
09:11:13,200 --> 09:11:14,100
Watch out here.

15690
09:11:14,940 --> 09:11:16,400
Watch out right here.

15691
09:11:17,100 --> 09:11:18,640
Wait, this is not the way.

15692
09:11:19,060 --> 09:11:20,500
Don't follow me.

15693
09:11:20,940 --> 09:11:23,180
I'm scared they're gonna fucking hit us after that.

15694
09:11:27,240 --> 09:11:29,080
In fact, I'm just gonna kill this guy.

15695
09:11:34,000 --> 09:11:34,480
Easy.

15696
09:11:34,480 --> 09:11:36,380
And I'm gonna take his leather.

15697
09:11:36,640 --> 09:11:37,040
Nice.

15698
09:11:38,860 --> 09:11:39,880
Alright, which way is it?

15699
09:11:41,440 --> 09:11:42,860
Why did you go ahead of me?

15700
09:11:43,060 --> 09:11:43,880
I don't know.

15701
09:11:44,040 --> 09:11:45,600
I just wanted to look at the open.

15702
09:11:46,940 --> 09:11:48,760
I'm checking the coordinates.

15703
09:11:50,380 --> 09:11:52,200
Okay, we're just straight ahead.

15704
09:11:52,860 --> 09:11:54,240
Okay, just straight ahead.

15705
09:11:56,740 --> 09:11:57,700
Oh shit.

15706
09:11:57,780 --> 09:11:58,460
There's one here.

15707
09:12:03,080 --> 09:12:03,560
Yeah!

15708
09:12:03,560 --> 09:12:04,760
Back, beast!

15709
09:12:04,940 --> 09:12:05,220
Back!

15710
09:12:05,320 --> 09:12:06,300
Yeah, back!

15711
09:12:06,440 --> 09:12:07,180
Stay back!

15712
09:12:07,240 --> 09:12:08,080
Stay back, beast!

15713
09:12:08,500 --> 09:12:09,620
Stay back, beast!

15714
09:12:15,250 --> 09:12:16,190
Be gone!

15715
09:12:17,050 --> 09:12:19,170
Be gone, you vile creatures!

15716
09:12:19,270 --> 09:12:19,710
Be gone!

15717
09:12:19,830 --> 09:12:20,790
Oh wait, there's nothing here.

15718
09:12:25,070 --> 09:12:27,250
Oh my gosh, where's the gold?

15719
09:12:27,330 --> 09:12:29,270
You wanna trade with these guys while we're here?

15720
09:12:29,790 --> 09:12:31,390
I don't have...

15721
09:12:31,390 --> 09:12:32,550
I have eight.

15722
09:12:32,550 --> 09:12:35,070
Oh, eight nuggies or eight pieces?

15723
09:12:35,530 --> 09:12:38,150
Eight nuggies.

15724
09:12:38,350 --> 09:12:38,950
Oh, okay.

15725
09:12:39,430 --> 09:12:42,570
We got five more gold, but there's no gold here.

15726
09:12:43,970 --> 09:12:44,950
You just head straight?

15727
09:12:45,590 --> 09:12:47,090
Yeah, just keep going straight.

15728
09:12:51,870 --> 09:12:53,450
Wait, there's gold right there!

15729
09:12:54,170 --> 09:12:55,370
There's gold right there, okay.

15730
09:12:55,750 --> 09:12:57,570
Hold on, let's check the area first.

15731
09:12:59,330 --> 09:12:59,830
Um...

15732
09:12:59,830 --> 09:13:00,910
Is it safe?

15733
09:13:01,130 --> 09:13:02,350
I don't see any guys.

15734
09:13:02,950 --> 09:13:04,750
Alright, I believe you!

15735
09:13:05,450 --> 09:13:08,850
But I can't see over your area though, so...

15736
09:13:08,850 --> 09:13:10,710
I believe you!

15737
09:13:10,730 --> 09:13:11,370
Okay, nice.

15738
09:13:12,810 --> 09:13:13,610
Nice, nice.

15739
09:13:14,310 --> 09:13:14,530
Okay.

15740
09:13:19,510 --> 09:13:20,070
What the hell?

15741
09:13:20,170 --> 09:13:21,130
Why can't I build a thing here?

15742
09:13:21,990 --> 09:13:23,410
I'm trying to like protect you.

15743
09:13:23,850 --> 09:13:25,070
Like a little house or something.

15744
09:13:26,790 --> 09:13:27,630
Okay, nice.

15745
09:13:30,190 --> 09:13:30,670
Nice.

15746
09:13:30,670 --> 09:13:31,470
Nice, that was a good amount.

15747
09:13:31,590 --> 09:13:33,190
That was...

15748
09:13:33,190 --> 09:13:34,070
Thirty-four!

15749
09:13:34,970 --> 09:13:35,930
Thirty-four!

15750
09:13:36,270 --> 09:13:36,410
Okay.

15751
09:13:38,770 --> 09:13:42,970
Alright guys, remember, we're trying to get to negative five hundred and five.

15752
09:13:43,830 --> 09:13:44,310
And...

15753
09:13:44,310 --> 09:13:44,990
Which way do we go?

15754
09:13:45,110 --> 09:13:45,590
195.

15755
09:13:45,910 --> 09:13:46,970
We just keep going straight this way.

15756
09:13:47,610 --> 09:13:48,070
This way?

15757
09:13:48,250 --> 09:13:49,390
Where are we at?

15758
09:13:50,430 --> 09:13:51,330
Don't look.

15759
09:13:51,570 --> 09:13:52,150
Don't look.

15760
09:13:53,570 --> 09:13:56,670
That's why I said maybe we should just get the two more!

15761
09:13:56,670 --> 09:13:58,130
I looked.

15762
09:13:59,730 --> 09:14:00,170
I...

15763
09:14:00,170 --> 09:14:01,470
I looked.

15764
09:14:02,630 --> 09:14:03,070
Yeah.

15765
09:14:05,270 --> 09:14:07,270
Maybe we should just get the two more.

15766
09:14:07,270 --> 09:14:08,330
We ran out of gold!

15767
09:14:08,450 --> 09:14:09,650
We ran out of gold.

15768
09:14:09,750 --> 09:14:10,970
There were no more gold to farm.

15769
09:14:11,110 --> 09:14:11,990
We farmed...

15770
09:14:11,990 --> 09:14:13,990
We like demolished the area.

15771
09:14:14,470 --> 09:14:16,970
We've taken all the natural resources around us.

15772
09:14:17,150 --> 09:14:17,830
It's over.

15773
09:14:17,970 --> 09:14:18,450
Where are you?

15774
09:14:18,610 --> 09:14:19,070
Oh, there you are.

15775
09:14:19,870 --> 09:14:21,190
You wanna get this guy?

15776
09:14:23,010 --> 09:14:23,970
Hit him up.

15777
09:14:24,030 --> 09:14:25,150
He might have some good stuff.

15778
09:14:25,150 --> 09:14:27,190
Okay, I'm gonna... I'm making the gold now.

15779
09:14:27,510 --> 09:14:28,590
Yeah, he might have some good stuff.

15780
09:14:28,710 --> 09:14:29,150
Come on, guy.

15781
09:14:29,870 --> 09:14:31,070
We can just get out of here.

15782
09:14:31,210 --> 09:14:32,390
Like, we can just leave.

15783
09:14:33,110 --> 09:14:35,190
Alright, let's see if we can get the...

15784
09:14:35,690 --> 09:14:37,730
Oh my god, why did he drop that?

15785
09:14:37,810 --> 09:14:39,390
Why is he running away from me?

15786
09:14:45,500 --> 09:14:46,480
I'm so tired.

15787
09:14:48,260 --> 09:14:49,260
He gave me quartz.

15788
09:14:50,320 --> 09:14:51,460
He gave me quartz.

15789
09:14:52,120 --> 09:14:53,500
Okay, but that's just one.

15790
09:14:54,680 --> 09:14:55,980
He gave me crying obsidian.

15791
09:14:56,080 --> 09:14:57,580
Hey, he gave me three crying obsidian.

15792
09:14:57,580 --> 09:14:59,320
He gave me three crying obsidian.

15793
09:15:01,480 --> 09:15:03,640
And then I got leather.

15794
09:15:04,900 --> 09:15:06,640
Okay, but you can give the leather to me.

15795
09:15:15,300 --> 09:15:15,980
That's it?

15796
09:15:16,100 --> 09:15:16,820
That's all you got?

15797
09:15:17,360 --> 09:15:18,400
That's all I got.

15798
09:15:19,180 --> 09:15:21,580
Crying obsidian and quartz.

15799
09:15:22,920 --> 09:15:25,980
Okay, let's keep going this way then.

15800
09:15:28,960 --> 09:15:29,960
We're digging through.

15801
09:15:30,500 --> 09:15:31,800
We're gonna try for gold.

15802
09:15:32,440 --> 09:15:33,640
We're gonna try and get gold.

15803
09:15:33,740 --> 09:15:34,500
We're gonna get gold.

15804
09:15:34,860 --> 09:15:36,500
We're gonna get gold in these mines.

15805
09:15:36,660 --> 09:15:37,420
We're gonna get gold.

15806
09:15:37,700 --> 09:15:38,960
We're gonna strike it rich.

15807
09:15:39,300 --> 09:15:41,820
Doki bird, you and me, we're gonna strike it rich.

15808
09:15:41,980 --> 09:15:42,180
We're gonna...

15809
09:15:42,740 --> 09:15:44,120
Wait, why are you guys backing?

15810
09:15:44,360 --> 09:15:46,960
We've never left another.

15811
09:15:47,420 --> 09:15:48,940
There's no why are we backing.

15812
09:15:49,100 --> 09:15:50,240
We just stay there.

15813
09:15:53,460 --> 09:15:54,900
Oh, there's some gold in here.

15814
09:15:57,580 --> 09:15:59,580
Hold on, let's build a bridge over there.

15815
09:16:05,640 --> 09:16:06,600
My bad.

15816
09:16:08,440 --> 09:16:09,400
My bad.

15817
09:16:09,780 --> 09:16:10,180
Oops.

15818
09:16:10,980 --> 09:16:13,560
I don't wanna hit you accidentally so you can get off.

15819
09:16:13,680 --> 09:16:14,660
Oh, you're making me...

15820
09:16:14,660 --> 09:16:17,160
Stop placing blocks, this is my job.

15821
09:16:17,700 --> 09:16:19,540
I'm the architect here, okay?

15822
09:16:20,120 --> 09:16:21,300
This is my work.

15823
09:16:22,760 --> 09:16:23,100
Okay.

15824
09:16:23,320 --> 09:16:24,020
God damn it.

15825
09:16:24,020 --> 09:16:26,140
Fine, you can get it.

15826
09:16:26,200 --> 09:16:26,840
I don't even care.

15827
09:16:27,660 --> 09:16:30,340
There's two, there's another area right here.

15828
09:16:30,380 --> 09:16:31,720
Okay, where?

15829
09:16:31,980 --> 09:16:34,220
I'm just trying to be efficient.

15830
09:16:37,780 --> 09:16:39,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15831
09:16:39,740 --> 09:16:41,480
I see, I get it.

15832
09:16:41,800 --> 09:16:43,920
See, there's one right here.

15833
09:16:45,340 --> 09:16:46,260
Look, see?

15834
09:16:46,540 --> 09:16:48,200
This is efficiency right here.

15835
09:16:48,640 --> 09:16:49,280
German efficiency.

15836
09:16:49,770 --> 09:16:51,000
I can't even grab it.

15837
09:16:51,000 --> 09:16:53,440
So you don't even have to take the blocks.

15838
09:16:53,800 --> 09:16:53,860
See?

15839
09:16:54,640 --> 09:16:55,840
German efficiency.

15840
09:16:55,940 --> 09:16:56,780
Right there, right there.

15841
09:16:57,180 --> 09:16:58,740
Alright, so which way do we go now?

15842
09:16:58,900 --> 09:16:59,780
We keep going straight.

15843
09:17:00,840 --> 09:17:01,400
Straight?

15844
09:17:02,000 --> 09:17:02,440
Alright.

15845
09:17:04,160 --> 09:17:04,700
Alright.

15846
09:17:05,680 --> 09:17:06,780
Let's keep going.

15847
09:17:07,420 --> 09:17:09,300
Oh, oh, another area.

15848
09:17:10,100 --> 09:17:12,020
There's so much quartz in here!

15849
09:17:12,540 --> 09:17:14,200
Why is there so much quartz?

15850
09:17:14,600 --> 09:17:15,480
It's just...

15851
09:17:15,480 --> 09:17:16,740
The land of the quartz.

15852
09:17:17,100 --> 09:17:18,260
Oh my god.

15853
09:17:18,260 --> 09:17:20,020
The land of the quartz.

15854
09:17:20,160 --> 09:17:21,100
Oh look, there's gold.

15855
09:17:21,240 --> 09:17:22,100
It's so far up.

15856
09:17:22,260 --> 09:17:23,000
There it is.

15857
09:17:23,080 --> 09:17:25,120
A tiny two pieces of gold.

15858
09:17:29,700 --> 09:17:30,660
Further onward.

15859
09:17:31,660 --> 09:17:32,800
Off we go.

15860
09:17:33,020 --> 09:17:33,680
Oh, what was that?

15861
09:17:35,920 --> 09:17:36,880
Further onward.

15862
09:17:37,100 --> 09:17:38,200
Onward, onward.

15863
09:17:38,260 --> 09:17:38,560
Everybody.

15864
09:17:39,760 --> 09:17:40,980
Onward we go.

15865
09:17:41,540 --> 09:17:44,020
I think this is the worst sea we decided to stay on.

15866
09:17:44,740 --> 09:17:45,300
I know, right?

15867
09:17:45,300 --> 09:17:47,100
Oh my god, there's so much gold here.

15868
09:17:47,300 --> 09:17:48,700
Oh my god, thank god.

15869
09:17:48,800 --> 09:17:50,640
Oh, there's a good amount.

15870
09:17:52,720 --> 09:17:53,980
You want me to grab it?

15871
09:17:54,280 --> 09:17:55,440
No, I can grab it.

15872
09:17:55,720 --> 09:17:56,640
Just be careful.

15873
09:17:58,780 --> 09:18:00,520
Oh, there's more over here too.

15874
09:18:01,260 --> 09:18:01,940
There's more!

15875
09:18:02,080 --> 09:18:03,880
I'll dig a tunnel over here to the gold.

15876
09:18:04,580 --> 09:18:06,160
Okay, we just gotta find some piglins now.

15877
09:18:06,520 --> 09:18:07,220
Come on, piglins.

15878
09:18:09,500 --> 09:18:10,840
Show thyself, piglin.

15879
09:18:10,840 --> 09:18:12,980
Come on.

15880
09:18:13,180 --> 09:18:15,460
It would be so cool if you guys just show up.

15881
09:18:16,000 --> 09:18:17,480
It would be so funny.

15882
09:18:17,600 --> 09:18:18,720
It would be so funny.

15883
09:18:19,000 --> 09:18:21,820
Do you guys want to do something really funny right now?

15884
09:18:21,920 --> 09:18:23,180
But, like, don't show up right now.

15885
09:18:23,300 --> 09:18:24,780
Because that would be, like, kind of rude.

15886
09:18:26,240 --> 09:18:28,100
But it would be so funny though.

15887
09:18:28,200 --> 09:18:29,080
Oh, oopsie.

15888
09:18:32,100 --> 09:18:32,800
I'm a kid.

15889
09:18:32,900 --> 09:18:33,820
Got more gold.

15890
09:18:34,180 --> 09:18:35,100
There's more gold over here.

15891
09:18:35,180 --> 09:18:35,940
I wasn't worried.

15892
09:18:38,160 --> 09:18:39,340
Oh my god.

15893
09:18:39,540 --> 09:18:40,440
Oh my god.

15894
09:18:41,360 --> 09:18:43,140
Where are these little piggies?

15895
09:18:43,400 --> 09:18:45,680
This little piggy went, went, went, went...

15896
09:18:45,680 --> 09:18:46,900
All the way home.

15897
09:18:47,820 --> 09:18:48,560
All the way home.

15898
09:18:48,580 --> 09:18:49,480
Okay, I got seven.

15899
09:18:51,740 --> 09:18:52,940
Grab these, grab these.

15900
09:18:53,920 --> 09:18:55,040
Grab these, grab these.

15901
09:18:55,040 --> 09:18:56,660
Oh, you didn't have inventory space, right?

15902
09:18:56,740 --> 09:18:57,420
No, I don't.

15903
09:18:59,300 --> 09:19:01,160
Okay, I think that is...

15904
09:19:02,000 --> 09:19:02,960
We got ten.

15905
09:19:02,960 --> 09:19:03,720
We have ten.

15906
09:19:04,480 --> 09:19:06,820
We just need to find... We just gotta find them.

15907
09:19:07,400 --> 09:19:08,380
What are we at?

15908
09:19:08,880 --> 09:19:11,600
Okay, we have to get a little lower actually.

15909
09:19:11,740 --> 09:19:12,980
We'll get lower eventually.

15910
09:19:13,160 --> 09:19:13,600
We'll get there.

15911
09:19:13,900 --> 09:19:15,880
We have a boat.

15912
09:19:15,980 --> 09:19:17,620
We have a boat.

15913
09:19:17,960 --> 09:19:20,300
Can I have my crafting table?

15914
09:19:22,860 --> 09:19:24,760
I mean, just give two to me.

15915
09:19:25,020 --> 09:19:27,180
I have the space for it anyway.

15916
09:19:27,300 --> 09:19:27,440
Okay, okay.

15917
09:19:27,940 --> 09:19:29,620
Alright, I'm just gonna make a bridge over here.

15918
09:19:34,160 --> 09:19:35,760
Do you think we'll do this tonight?

15919
09:19:36,580 --> 09:19:37,540
Yes, Mint.

15920
09:19:38,100 --> 09:19:39,680
We're not clickbaiters, Mint.

15921
09:19:39,800 --> 09:19:41,820
We're not clickbaiters, Mint.

15922
09:19:41,820 --> 09:19:44,500
No, but I mean if we have to fall asleep and then wake back up.

15923
09:19:44,720 --> 09:19:45,720
Mint, we're not.

15924
09:19:45,760 --> 09:19:47,180
We're not clickbaiters, Mint.

15925
09:19:47,620 --> 09:19:48,240
We're not.

15926
09:19:48,320 --> 09:19:50,100
The stream doesn't end, Mint.

15927
09:19:50,520 --> 09:19:53,100
The stream... This is why we had that one day, Mint.

15928
09:19:53,320 --> 09:19:54,560
Yeah, but they got to go...

15929
09:19:54,560 --> 09:19:57,220
The people who took 20 days got to go to sleep.

15930
09:19:57,540 --> 09:19:58,560
Do we not get to sleep?

15931
09:19:58,620 --> 09:20:00,200
Because it took them 20 days!

15932
09:20:00,200 --> 09:20:04,220
They played for like two to three days straight without sleeping.

15933
09:20:04,760 --> 09:20:06,860
And then they're like, we gotta sleep.

15934
09:20:07,040 --> 09:20:08,840
It took longer than they expected.

15935
09:20:09,620 --> 09:20:13,760
If this is gonna take us more than a day, then like...

15936
09:20:13,760 --> 09:20:15,720
Maybe we do sleep.

15937
09:20:16,100 --> 09:20:18,120
But for now, we're in too deep.

15938
09:20:18,200 --> 09:20:19,080
We're in too deep, Mint.

15939
09:20:19,140 --> 09:20:19,880
We're in too deep.

15940
09:20:22,960 --> 09:20:26,040
Why did I agree to let you have...

15941
09:20:26,040 --> 09:20:27,060
Let me do this...

15942
09:20:27,060 --> 09:20:30,040
I'm literally leaving town in like two days.

15943
09:20:30,040 --> 09:20:31,580
Why did I let you do this?

15944
09:20:31,760 --> 09:20:32,500
I don't know.

15945
09:20:32,600 --> 09:20:33,240
I don't know why.

15946
09:20:33,440 --> 09:20:35,820
You said we were like...

15947
09:20:35,820 --> 09:20:38,620
Okay, we'll have that one day be like a free day.

15948
09:20:38,800 --> 09:20:40,720
But you wanted to start at five!

15949
09:20:41,780 --> 09:20:42,980
We started at two.

15950
09:20:43,180 --> 09:20:43,800
We started at two.

15951
09:20:43,900 --> 09:20:45,120
We started at two!

15952
09:20:45,800 --> 09:20:46,860
Oh, it was five for you.

15953
09:20:48,520 --> 09:20:49,740
You could've started earlier.

15954
09:20:50,040 --> 09:20:50,980
You could've started earlier.

15955
09:20:51,280 --> 09:20:52,780
You could've asked for an earlier time.

15956
09:20:52,980 --> 09:20:53,480
I did!

15957
09:20:53,740 --> 09:20:56,560
You wanted to initially start at nine, my time!

15958
09:20:56,560 --> 09:20:57,980
And then I was like...

15959
09:20:57,980 --> 09:20:59,340
Okay, let's just do two.

15960
09:20:59,620 --> 09:21:01,040
But you could've started earlier.

15961
09:21:01,160 --> 09:21:02,500
You could've asked for an earlier time.

15962
09:21:03,840 --> 09:21:04,640
I'm gonna kill you.

15963
09:21:04,820 --> 09:21:05,300
I'm gonna kill you.

15964
09:21:05,420 --> 09:21:05,960
I'm gonna kill you.

15965
09:21:07,100 --> 09:21:10,660
I'm gonna kill you.

15966
09:21:10,660 --> 09:21:11,420
I'm gonna kill you.

15967
09:21:14,780 --> 09:21:15,580
You better...

15968
09:21:16,620 --> 09:21:18,180
You better go to those pigs.

15969
09:21:18,320 --> 09:21:20,260
And you better get that obsidian right now!

15970
09:21:21,120 --> 09:21:21,880
Right now!

15971
09:21:22,320 --> 09:21:24,940
I did 200 rolls.

15972
09:21:24,940 --> 09:21:26,780
I did 200 fucking rolls!

15973
09:21:26,780 --> 09:21:28,460
Get better gacha luck!

15974
09:21:36,020 --> 09:21:38,420
I'm gonna take a week off of streaming...

15975
09:21:38,420 --> 09:21:39,860
and everybody will blame you.

15976
09:21:40,480 --> 09:21:43,880
Next week we are gonna be gone.

15977
09:21:44,100 --> 09:21:44,840
Oh yeah, that's true.

15978
09:21:44,900 --> 09:21:46,120
I am actually gonna be gone.

15979
09:21:47,900 --> 09:21:49,300
It's practically a week.

15980
09:21:49,300 --> 09:21:50,480
And I blame you!

15981
09:21:50,780 --> 09:21:52,440
They'll have you to blame!

15982
09:21:57,420 --> 09:21:58,300
Watch out!

15983
09:21:58,440 --> 09:21:58,560
Watch out!

15984
09:22:01,800 --> 09:22:02,680
I wasn't...

15985
09:22:02,680 --> 09:22:04,620
I couldn't...

15986
09:22:04,620 --> 09:22:05,260
Oh shit.

15987
09:22:06,020 --> 09:22:07,680
I was trying to get there.

15988
09:22:08,620 --> 09:22:10,300
Okay, hold on.

15989
09:22:11,020 --> 09:22:11,700
There we go.

15990
09:22:14,460 --> 09:22:15,200
Okay, hold on.

15991
09:22:15,420 --> 09:22:16,320
I'm blocking it up.

15992
09:22:17,060 --> 09:22:17,760
There we go.

15993
09:22:19,600 --> 09:22:20,460
I did it!

15994
09:22:20,540 --> 09:22:21,860
I blocked it up.

15995
09:22:21,860 --> 09:22:22,780
I blocked it up.

15996
09:22:23,560 --> 09:22:24,460
We're safe.

15997
09:22:24,540 --> 09:22:25,160
We're good.

15998
09:22:25,300 --> 09:22:26,300
Everything's fine.

15999
09:22:26,780 --> 09:22:28,720
Hold on, I'm gonna move my thing over though.

16000
09:22:30,560 --> 09:22:31,940
Doki hates us.

16001
09:22:35,580 --> 09:22:37,820
I was reading my chat!

16002
09:22:38,340 --> 09:22:39,620
I was reading my chat!

16003
09:22:40,180 --> 09:22:41,480
Someone sent me a super chat...

16004
09:22:41,480 --> 09:22:43,140
and you expect me not to read it out loud?

16005
09:22:43,300 --> 09:22:44,920
That's so rude of me not to...

16006
09:22:44,920 --> 09:22:46,580
Thank you for the super chat.

16007
09:22:46,720 --> 09:22:48,820
The super chat said Doki hates us.

16008
09:22:48,820 --> 09:22:50,980
You were allowed to read the super chat out loud!

16009
09:22:50,980 --> 09:22:52,500
You've always been allowed!

16010
09:22:52,640 --> 09:22:53,680
What do you think I just said?

16011
09:22:54,440 --> 09:22:55,940
Oh wait, let me check on her.

16012
09:22:58,720 --> 09:22:59,900
Hold on, okay.

16013
09:23:00,260 --> 09:23:01,880
We are going down...

16014
09:23:02,680 --> 09:23:04,240
too slowly in the Z.

16015
09:23:04,980 --> 09:23:07,260
But we are making it...

16016
09:23:07,260 --> 09:23:08,020
in the X.

16017
09:23:10,960 --> 09:23:13,180
Okay, in the X is where we're...

16018
09:23:13,180 --> 09:23:14,500
we're the furthest away.

16019
09:23:14,800 --> 09:23:15,700
Yeah, kinda.

16020
09:23:15,700 --> 09:23:17,800
Oh, I need you to put down the...

16021
09:23:19,060 --> 09:23:20,420
Oh yeah, I forgot.

16022
09:23:20,940 --> 09:23:23,480
Alright, you take that then.

16023
09:23:23,620 --> 09:23:23,840
See?

16024
09:23:24,440 --> 09:23:24,680
I told you.

16025
09:23:24,980 --> 09:23:26,260
You're right, you're right.

16026
09:23:27,540 --> 09:23:28,760
I told you.

16027
09:23:30,120 --> 09:23:34,180
I wanted to free your fucking inventory space.

16028
09:23:34,320 --> 09:23:36,140
I have too much cool stuff.

16029
09:23:36,520 --> 09:23:37,160
You don't understand.

16030
09:23:38,760 --> 09:23:39,860
Oh, I don't understand.

16031
09:23:41,440 --> 09:23:43,000
Alright, let me dig, let me dig.

16032
09:23:45,920 --> 09:23:47,220
Alright, your turn.

16033
09:23:48,180 --> 09:23:51,580
Yeah, I've been doing all the work.

16034
09:23:51,660 --> 09:23:53,500
Oh, okay, go back, go back!

16035
09:23:53,760 --> 09:23:55,340
Get out, get out, get out!

16036
09:23:55,480 --> 09:23:56,900
No, no, no, no, no!

16037
09:23:57,160 --> 09:23:57,920
No, no!

16038
09:24:01,370 --> 09:24:03,290
Someone's too afraid of the lava!

16039
09:24:03,970 --> 09:24:05,790
Someone is just like...

16040
09:24:05,790 --> 09:24:07,930
What if I'm stupid and I...

16041
09:24:07,930 --> 09:24:09,510
and I die to the lava?

16042
09:24:10,110 --> 09:24:12,390
That's literally how you sounded earlier!

16043
09:24:13,010 --> 09:24:13,870
You're like...

16044
09:24:13,870 --> 09:24:14,410
I'm scared of the lava.

16045
09:24:14,410 --> 09:24:15,830
That's true, my chat was like...

16046
09:24:15,830 --> 09:24:17,030
She is called Maid Mint.

16047
09:24:17,610 --> 09:24:19,770
Yeah, be a maid right now.

16048
09:24:19,910 --> 09:24:21,190
And fucking do your work.

16049
09:24:22,710 --> 09:24:24,610
I'm a maid cafe maid!

16050
09:24:25,570 --> 09:24:28,170
And if your chat knew any culture...

16051
09:24:28,170 --> 09:24:29,530
they would know that!

16052
09:24:30,050 --> 09:24:31,690
I'm a maid cafe maid!

16053
09:24:33,070 --> 09:24:34,410
Oh, you gotta grab this.

16054
09:24:34,810 --> 09:24:35,790
Alright, turn around.

16055
09:24:35,870 --> 09:24:36,990
Why are you digging it?

16056
09:24:38,450 --> 09:24:39,010
Because...

16057
09:24:39,010 --> 09:24:40,470
Alright, your turn.

16058
09:24:40,470 --> 09:24:41,030
Alright.

16059
09:24:42,630 --> 09:24:43,430
Typical maid.

16060
09:24:43,930 --> 09:24:46,730
Oh no, I was reading a super chat that someone sent me.

16061
09:24:47,090 --> 09:24:47,530
Oh yeah?

16062
09:24:47,630 --> 09:24:48,710
What was it?

16063
09:24:48,770 --> 09:24:50,510
It was actually them asking something...

16064
09:24:50,510 --> 09:24:52,090
but I don't wanna answer it now!

16065
09:24:52,430 --> 09:24:53,690
Oh, you don't wanna...

16066
09:24:53,690 --> 09:24:55,810
I'm getting the boat, I'm fucking getting the boat.

16067
09:24:56,090 --> 09:24:58,130
I'm getting the boat right now.

16068
09:24:58,310 --> 09:24:58,970
Do we need the boat?

16069
09:25:00,150 --> 09:25:00,850
Yeah, you wanna jump?

16070
09:25:02,190 --> 09:25:03,730
No, we can just keep...

16071
09:25:03,730 --> 09:25:05,190
Let me make a bridge, let me make a bridge.

16072
09:25:05,250 --> 09:25:05,830
We keep going.

16073
09:25:06,610 --> 09:25:08,610
We keep going through the walls, it's the safest.

16074
09:25:08,610 --> 09:25:11,450
What, you wanna experience more gassed activity?

16075
09:25:11,690 --> 09:25:11,870
I don't think so.

16076
09:25:11,870 --> 09:25:14,810
I'm just thinking like, oh, why don't we bump into one of those pigs?

16077
09:25:15,890 --> 09:25:16,810
What about a pig?

16078
09:25:16,970 --> 09:25:17,550
It's fine!

16079
09:25:18,090 --> 09:25:19,810
Oh, you wanna see a pig.

16080
09:25:20,410 --> 09:25:23,090
No, I meant the piglings!

16081
09:25:23,570 --> 09:25:25,290
Oh, okay, hold on.

16082
09:25:25,530 --> 09:25:25,790
We'll make it.

16083
09:25:26,230 --> 09:25:28,450
No, no, no, we don't need to see the piglings.

16084
09:25:28,550 --> 09:25:29,350
Let's keep going forward.

16085
09:25:30,570 --> 09:25:32,190
Oh look, there's a pigling right in front of us!

16086
09:25:32,470 --> 09:25:33,410
Build a bridge, build a bridge!

16087
09:25:33,430 --> 09:25:35,030
There's a pigling literally right in front of us!

16088
09:25:35,130 --> 09:25:36,670
That guy that's a hoglin?

16089
09:25:36,670 --> 09:25:38,930
The one that will try to murder us?

16090
09:25:39,290 --> 09:25:39,930
I don't know!

16091
09:25:40,270 --> 09:25:41,570
The fucking good ones!

16092
09:25:42,230 --> 09:25:43,710
I don't see a good one.

16093
09:25:44,490 --> 09:25:46,210
I'm getting the block right now.

16094
09:25:46,390 --> 09:25:47,550
Okay, you do it, you do it.

16095
09:25:47,970 --> 09:25:49,350
Do you guys see a good one?

16096
09:25:49,450 --> 09:25:50,170
I don't see a good one.

16097
09:25:50,670 --> 09:25:51,890
Look to your left, look to your left.

16098
09:25:52,030 --> 09:25:54,170
Okay, now I see him.

16099
09:25:55,190 --> 09:25:55,990
Oh no!

16100
09:25:57,110 --> 09:26:00,250
I couldn't see him, he was blocked by your big old head!

16101
09:26:00,670 --> 09:26:02,730
You were in front of me!

16102
09:26:05,170 --> 09:26:07,010
Oh man, that sucks.

16103
09:26:07,430 --> 09:26:08,770
It's okay, it's okay, he fell.

16104
09:26:09,150 --> 09:26:10,310
I saw you miss too.

16105
09:26:11,610 --> 09:26:12,790
Oh, get your mushrooms ready.

16106
09:26:13,230 --> 09:26:15,710
I got my mushrooms, I got my mushrooms.

16107
09:26:16,110 --> 09:26:17,830
You also have one like right here.

16108
09:26:18,030 --> 09:26:18,510
Where'd he go?

16109
09:26:19,030 --> 09:26:20,070
Oh, he's over here.

16110
09:26:20,390 --> 09:26:22,490
Alright, ten, we have ten.

16111
09:26:22,730 --> 09:26:23,810
Ten, alright.

16112
09:26:24,770 --> 09:26:26,470
I'll put a mushroom next to me just in case.

16113
09:26:26,490 --> 09:26:28,110
Yeah, I put one around too.

16114
09:26:28,630 --> 09:26:30,990
Okay, alright, this is it, the gacha.

16115
09:26:31,550 --> 09:26:32,430
This is it.

16116
09:26:32,430 --> 09:26:33,450
Stay away.

16117
09:26:34,090 --> 09:26:34,970
Stay away, ugly.

16118
09:26:36,410 --> 09:26:37,750
Oh my god, we got one, we got one!

16119
09:26:37,970 --> 09:26:38,770
Mint, get over here!

16120
09:26:38,850 --> 09:26:39,510
We got one!

16121
09:26:39,510 --> 09:26:40,090
We got one!

16122
09:26:40,750 --> 09:26:42,950
Oh my god, just one more!

16123
09:26:43,210 --> 09:26:44,610
One more, one more, one more.

16124
09:26:46,110 --> 09:26:47,790
Oh my god, just one more.

16125
09:26:47,910 --> 09:26:48,570
Why did I do that?

16126
09:26:49,210 --> 09:26:50,910
Just one more, just one more.

16127
09:26:51,290 --> 09:26:52,130
Oh my god, please!

16128
09:26:53,410 --> 09:26:56,310
Please, sir, please be kind to us!

16129
09:26:56,490 --> 09:26:57,390
We got him, we got him!

16130
09:26:57,470 --> 09:26:57,830
Yes!

16131
09:26:57,830 --> 09:26:57,950
Yes!

16132
09:27:00,690 --> 09:27:01,910
Oh my god!

16133
09:27:02,190 --> 09:27:03,290
Oh my god, we got two!

16134
09:27:08,800 --> 09:27:09,600
This is it!

16135
09:27:10,640 --> 09:27:14,560
Wait, wait, wait, before I make these, you still have your diamond pickaxe?

16136
09:27:14,940 --> 09:27:15,280
Yeah, yeah.

16137
09:27:15,520 --> 09:27:17,900
Oh my god.

16138
09:27:19,060 --> 09:27:20,240
Yeah, I do.

16139
09:27:20,620 --> 09:27:21,280
Wait, what is it?

16140
09:27:21,400 --> 09:27:21,680
Two?

16141
09:27:22,500 --> 09:27:23,300
And then three?

16142
09:27:26,240 --> 09:27:27,500
One, two, three.

16143
09:27:27,760 --> 09:27:28,240
One, two, three.

16144
09:27:28,240 --> 09:27:30,800
One, two, three, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

16145
09:27:30,800 --> 09:27:31,120
And then...

16146
09:27:31,820 --> 09:27:32,860
Shut up!

16147
09:27:33,260 --> 09:27:36,080
And then right here...

16148
09:27:38,820 --> 09:27:40,980
And then it's fire time!

16149
09:27:43,900 --> 09:27:47,260
Get your bed ready just in case and a shield maybe.

16150
09:27:47,420 --> 09:27:47,860
I don't know.

16151
09:27:48,240 --> 09:27:49,980
Here we go!

16152
09:27:55,030 --> 09:27:56,870
Wait, how many enderpearls do you have?

16153
09:27:58,170 --> 09:27:59,270
What just happened?

16154
09:27:59,270 --> 09:27:59,330
What just happened?

16155
09:28:01,750 --> 09:28:02,190
Hello?

16156
09:28:02,370 --> 09:28:03,910
What the fuck is subspace bubble?

16157
09:28:04,710 --> 09:28:07,870
Use the nether to travel seven kilometers in the overworld.

16158
09:28:11,490 --> 09:28:13,230
Yeah, that sounds about right.

16159
09:28:13,610 --> 09:28:14,710
That sounds...

16160
09:28:14,710 --> 09:28:16,790
By the way, I don't have my bed anymore.

16161
09:28:17,050 --> 09:28:17,270
What?

16162
09:28:17,330 --> 09:28:18,410
What happened to your bed?

16163
09:28:19,290 --> 09:28:21,270
It's at our old spawn.

16164
09:28:24,670 --> 09:28:26,330
Should we head to our old spawn?

16165
09:28:26,330 --> 09:28:28,010
Should we head to our old nether?

16166
09:28:28,610 --> 09:28:29,690
Yeah, let me get the coordinates.

16167
09:28:29,970 --> 09:28:31,690
Let's get to our old...

16168
09:28:31,690 --> 09:28:33,090
Hold on, let me get the coordinates.

16169
09:28:34,810 --> 09:28:36,430
Hold on, I'm getting them.

16170
09:28:36,450 --> 09:28:37,530
Now we got...

16171
09:28:38,250 --> 09:28:43,210
So literally me being like, prepare your bed and you just didn't say anything.

16172
09:28:46,690 --> 09:28:48,350
Okay, do you want to know the damage?

16173
09:28:48,650 --> 09:28:49,430
Oh my god.

16174
09:28:50,990 --> 09:28:52,130
What's the damage?

16175
09:28:52,310 --> 09:28:53,830
What's the damage?

16176
09:28:55,050 --> 09:28:56,050
So...

16177
09:28:56,050 --> 09:28:57,810
Look at where we're at.

16178
09:28:58,710 --> 09:28:59,710
Okay.

16179
09:29:00,370 --> 09:29:02,290
We need to get to...

16180
09:29:02,290 --> 09:29:03,830
Minus 4,116.

16181
09:29:06,230 --> 09:29:07,870
Oh, what's the Z?

16182
09:29:08,370 --> 09:29:09,810
What's the Z?

16183
09:29:11,570 --> 09:29:12,630
What's the Z?

16184
09:29:13,230 --> 09:29:15,830
1,576.

16185
09:29:17,930 --> 09:29:19,910
Let's go traveling.

16186
09:29:19,910 --> 09:29:19,970
Let's go traveling.

16187
09:29:22,230 --> 09:29:23,210
Let's find...

16188
09:29:23,210 --> 09:29:24,510
Let's find a sheep, right?

16189
09:29:26,150 --> 09:29:27,910
Well, we might as well...

16190
09:29:27,910 --> 09:29:28,770
I don't think there's...

16191
09:29:28,770 --> 09:29:30,310
Wait, which way do we go?

16192
09:29:32,270 --> 09:29:32,790
Let's...

16193
09:29:32,790 --> 09:29:34,130
Oh yeah, good.

16194
09:29:34,270 --> 09:29:38,030
We gotta go to positive Z.

16195
09:29:38,670 --> 09:29:39,170
No, sorry.

16196
09:29:39,230 --> 09:29:40,330
Negative Z.

16197
09:29:41,030 --> 09:29:41,990
Negative Z.

16198
09:29:42,470 --> 09:29:43,670
We're not going the right way.

16199
09:29:43,670 --> 09:29:45,670
Okay, uh...

16200
09:29:47,830 --> 09:29:48,670
This way.

16201
09:29:49,950 --> 09:29:50,470
Alright.

16202
09:29:50,630 --> 09:29:53,890
We find a village first or we make it home.

16203
09:29:54,830 --> 09:29:57,030
We'll find a village probably somewhere.

16204
09:29:58,050 --> 09:29:59,590
It's one or the other.

16205
09:30:00,190 --> 09:30:01,530
It's one or the other.

16206
09:30:03,410 --> 09:30:05,790
The lapis and the enderpearl.

16207
09:30:06,450 --> 09:30:07,330
How many ender...

16208
09:30:07,330 --> 09:30:08,810
I have 10 enderpearls right now.

16209
09:30:08,850 --> 09:30:09,710
We have 10 out of 5.

16210
09:30:09,790 --> 09:30:10,330
We have 15.

16211
09:30:10,510 --> 09:30:11,670
Is that enough?

16212
09:30:11,670 --> 09:30:12,150
Is that enough, you guys?

16213
09:30:12,910 --> 09:30:13,910
Is that enough?

16214
09:30:14,930 --> 09:30:17,590
I mean, guys, we gotta go this way anyway.

16215
09:30:17,970 --> 09:30:21,030
Oh wait, this might be a good time to get the phantom, right?

16216
09:30:21,670 --> 09:30:22,730
Yeah, exactly.

16217
09:30:22,910 --> 09:30:25,150
We can just walk around until the phantom appears.

16218
09:30:26,050 --> 09:30:28,790
I mean, we have to not sleep for like 3 days.

16219
09:30:29,350 --> 09:30:30,050
Yeah, that's fine.

16220
09:30:31,030 --> 09:30:34,430
I love how we're like absolutely littering in this world.

16221
09:30:35,630 --> 09:30:39,150
We're never coming back to see the damages we caused environmentally.

16222
09:30:39,150 --> 09:30:39,310
It's true.

16223
09:30:40,510 --> 09:30:43,410
We're gonna defeat the ender dragon and delete Minecraft.

16224
09:30:45,670 --> 09:30:46,690
That is enough.

16225
09:30:46,830 --> 09:30:47,530
What the fuck?

16226
09:30:48,150 --> 09:30:50,450
The sugarcane just killed itself.

16227
09:30:50,930 --> 09:30:52,510
You're not going the right way.

16228
09:30:52,990 --> 09:30:53,750
I'm not?

16229
09:30:53,870 --> 09:30:54,490
I barely...

16230
09:30:55,970 --> 09:30:56,490
This...

16231
09:30:56,490 --> 09:30:57,450
Oh gosh, hold on.

16232
09:30:57,930 --> 09:30:58,970
It's really confusing.

16233
09:30:59,310 --> 09:31:00,790
Cause one is really...

16234
09:31:00,790 --> 09:31:03,470
Okay, I think we just need to go down the X.

16235
09:31:04,110 --> 09:31:04,870
Okay, this way?

16236
09:31:05,050 --> 09:31:06,810
Oh, I need to eat.

16237
09:31:09,150 --> 09:31:09,990
We know we need food.

16238
09:31:11,930 --> 09:31:13,890
North... Northeast is where we need to go.

16239
09:31:13,910 --> 09:31:14,810
Am I going the right way?

16240
09:31:14,950 --> 09:31:16,110
Am I going the right way?

16241
09:31:16,190 --> 09:31:17,150
Well, I don't know.

16242
09:31:17,890 --> 09:31:19,030
Whoa, what is this?

16243
09:31:19,070 --> 09:31:19,950
It looks crazy.

16244
09:31:21,110 --> 09:31:22,630
Am I going the right way?

16245
09:31:22,630 --> 09:31:24,490
Just go around it.

16246
09:31:24,990 --> 09:31:26,430
Wait, we can just...

16247
09:31:26,430 --> 09:31:27,790
Make a boat.

16248
09:31:28,430 --> 09:31:29,190
Oh my god.

16249
09:31:30,010 --> 09:31:30,450
Get in.

16250
09:31:30,730 --> 09:31:31,070
Oh, okay.

16251
09:31:31,770 --> 09:31:33,210
Well, I would've.

16252
09:31:33,610 --> 09:31:34,010
But...

16253
09:31:34,010 --> 09:31:35,190
I'm drifting.

16254
09:31:35,370 --> 09:31:35,850
I'm drifting.

16255
09:31:36,130 --> 09:31:37,330
Okay, go, go, go!

16256
09:31:37,950 --> 09:31:39,070
Okay, give me a...

16257
09:31:39,070 --> 09:31:39,670
Give me a sec.

16258
09:31:39,750 --> 09:31:40,930
I need a... Okay, there we go.

16259
09:31:41,330 --> 09:31:41,970
There we go.

16260
09:31:42,030 --> 09:31:42,550
I'm rowing.

16261
09:31:42,570 --> 09:31:43,210
Give me a second.

16262
09:31:43,450 --> 09:31:44,950
I need to get my...

16263
09:31:44,950 --> 09:31:45,410
Village!

16264
09:31:45,730 --> 09:31:46,010
Village!

16265
09:31:46,090 --> 09:31:46,270
Village!

16266
09:31:47,690 --> 09:31:48,090
Where?!

16267
09:31:48,090 --> 09:31:48,650
Oh, okay.

16268
09:31:48,710 --> 09:31:48,990
Nice.

16269
09:31:53,070 --> 09:31:54,830
What does F4 do, guys?

16270
09:31:54,890 --> 09:31:55,950
I accidentally pressed F4.

16271
09:31:56,130 --> 09:31:57,710
I don't think it does anything, right?

16272
09:31:58,830 --> 09:31:59,570
I don't know.

16273
09:31:59,590 --> 09:32:01,270
I feel like every function does stuff.

16274
09:32:02,530 --> 09:32:04,810
It's like half normal and half, like...

16275
09:32:04,810 --> 09:32:07,970
I think we should just stay awake in here, right?

16276
09:32:08,190 --> 09:32:11,270
Like, we can just camp out here, but don't sleep.

16277
09:32:11,370 --> 09:32:13,310
Camp out the night?

16278
09:32:13,470 --> 09:32:15,190
But don't sleep, so that we...

16279
09:32:15,190 --> 09:32:16,750
It's gonna be the longest night cycle.

16280
09:32:17,170 --> 09:32:18,290
I know, but like...

16281
09:32:18,290 --> 09:32:20,550
We gotta stay up for several nights.

16282
09:32:20,910 --> 09:32:24,030
Well, we're gonna make the villagers turn into zombies.

16283
09:32:24,510 --> 09:32:25,630
No, they're asleep.

16284
09:32:26,610 --> 09:32:27,010
They're fine.

16285
09:32:27,610 --> 09:32:29,970
What if a zombie breaks open one of the doors?

16286
09:32:30,970 --> 09:32:32,850
Some of the villagers aren't even inside.

16287
09:32:34,290 --> 09:32:37,410
We're gonna cause a zombie apocalypse to these poor villagers.

16288
09:32:37,810 --> 09:32:39,150
Okay, then put down torches.

16289
09:32:39,250 --> 09:32:39,570
I don't know.

16290
09:32:39,670 --> 09:32:40,310
What do you want me to do?

16291
09:32:40,370 --> 09:32:41,950
We gotta stay awake.

16292
09:32:42,370 --> 09:32:44,730
Oh my god, that's so cruel.

16293
09:32:44,950 --> 09:32:45,990
I'm sorry, guys.

16294
09:32:46,490 --> 09:32:46,950
I'm sorry.

16295
09:32:47,190 --> 09:32:48,590
She doesn't care about you.

16296
09:32:48,590 --> 09:32:49,910
They're literally inside.

16297
09:32:50,290 --> 09:32:51,430
She doesn't care.

16298
09:32:51,530 --> 09:32:52,430
Yeah, they can break doors.

16299
09:32:52,550 --> 09:32:53,390
That's what zombies do.

16300
09:32:53,510 --> 09:32:54,290
They break doors.

16301
09:32:54,410 --> 09:32:56,130
Zombies do not break doors.

16302
09:32:56,790 --> 09:32:58,610
What Minecraft are you playing?

16303
09:32:59,170 --> 09:32:59,930
Yes, they do.

16304
09:33:00,010 --> 09:33:01,430
I saw them break doors.

16305
09:33:02,690 --> 09:33:03,250
What?

16306
09:33:03,670 --> 09:33:04,250
They do?

16307
09:33:04,490 --> 09:33:05,410
Why do we care about them?

16308
09:33:05,590 --> 09:33:07,310
Oh, they do in hard mode.

16309
09:33:07,570 --> 09:33:10,330
Oh my god, they do.

16310
09:33:10,830 --> 09:33:12,570
But only in hard mode.

16311
09:33:13,250 --> 09:33:14,110
I've seen it.

16312
09:33:14,330 --> 09:33:15,770
Aren't we in hardcore?

16313
09:33:16,210 --> 09:33:17,610
Yeah, but I didn't know that.

16314
09:33:17,690 --> 09:33:22,170
I've only played normal mode and I don't watch Minecraft YouTubers like you do.

16315
09:33:22,550 --> 09:33:23,790
No, what do you mean?

16316
09:33:23,990 --> 09:33:25,470
I've seen them break doors.

16317
09:33:25,610 --> 09:33:27,170
I've seen them break doors.

16318
09:33:28,490 --> 09:33:30,150
Wow, I didn't know that.

16319
09:33:30,990 --> 09:33:31,850
I had no idea.

16320
09:33:32,050 --> 09:33:32,870
I learned something today.

16321
09:33:35,410 --> 09:33:37,790
Someone said make fences in front of the doors.

16322
09:33:38,490 --> 09:33:40,830
Oh my god, I don't care enough about the villagers for that.

16323
09:33:41,170 --> 09:33:42,170
I'm just a virtue signal.

16324
09:33:42,950 --> 09:33:44,590
Yeah, I'm just here to virtue signal.

16325
09:33:46,670 --> 09:33:49,590
Here, I'll just put some nether rack.

16326
09:33:49,710 --> 09:33:50,250
That's fine.

16327
09:33:50,390 --> 09:33:51,370
I'll have plenty of it.

16328
09:33:54,050 --> 09:33:55,450
There, I make my own door.

16329
09:33:55,450 --> 09:33:56,750
There, they can't get in.

16330
09:33:56,990 --> 09:33:57,690
Stupid zombies.

16331
09:33:58,990 --> 09:33:59,970
Zombie, be gone.

16332
09:34:00,910 --> 09:34:02,490
There's no zombies near me yet.

16333
09:34:03,030 --> 09:34:05,890
I put down some torches, so I should be okay.

16334
09:34:07,130 --> 09:34:08,670
You're safe with me, sir.

16335
09:34:09,330 --> 09:34:10,810
Wait, there's a horse in front of me.

16336
09:34:11,970 --> 09:34:13,350
Yeah, there's a couple of horses here.

16337
09:34:14,070 --> 09:34:17,930
Yeah, if only we had a saddle, we could steal the horse and just ride on.

16338
09:34:18,570 --> 09:34:19,690
No, horses suck.

16339
09:34:20,270 --> 09:34:22,050
No, not all horses suck.

16340
09:34:22,050 --> 09:34:22,970
Not all horses.

16341
09:34:23,730 --> 09:34:26,310
I'm gonna go take this time to get water.

16342
09:34:26,970 --> 09:34:27,370
Okay.

16343
09:34:28,570 --> 09:34:31,810
Wait, we gotta kill chickens for feathers later.

16344
09:34:32,670 --> 09:34:34,450
Oh, yeah, we can do that.

16345
09:34:34,750 --> 09:34:36,130
Yeah, we gotta...

16346
09:34:36,130 --> 09:34:37,350
Are you leaving the house?

16347
09:34:37,870 --> 09:34:39,230
Oh my God, no, I'm not.

16348
09:34:39,410 --> 09:34:42,590
Someone said we can trade for feathers, but that's too much work.

16349
09:34:42,930 --> 09:34:46,410
That's too much work.

16350
09:34:47,070 --> 09:34:49,550
We'll kill them on our way, too.

16351
09:34:49,550 --> 09:34:51,310
We'll find chickens.

16352
09:34:51,630 --> 09:34:52,990
There's so many of them.

16353
09:34:52,990 --> 09:34:54,870
There's gonna be so many chickens.

16354
09:34:55,330 --> 09:34:56,430
Wait, oh wait.

16355
09:34:57,570 --> 09:35:02,190
We've been awake for several nights, so actually maybe the phantoms will just normally spawn.

16356
09:35:02,830 --> 09:35:04,130
But we were trapped in the nether.

16357
09:35:04,290 --> 09:35:04,970
Does that count?

16358
09:35:05,050 --> 09:35:06,050
Does that count, you guys?

16359
09:35:06,190 --> 09:35:06,910
It should, right?

16360
09:35:10,690 --> 09:35:12,010
Does it count?

16361
09:35:12,090 --> 09:35:13,290
Oh, it does count.

16362
09:35:13,970 --> 09:35:14,970
Oh my God.

16363
09:35:14,970 --> 09:35:16,030
So we need to go outside.

16364
09:35:16,030 --> 09:35:17,010
We need to go outside.

16365
09:35:18,190 --> 09:35:19,790
Okay, you go.

16366
09:35:20,830 --> 09:35:21,370
What the hell?

16367
09:35:22,250 --> 09:35:23,390
No, you too.

16368
09:35:24,050 --> 09:35:24,510
You too.

16369
09:35:24,970 --> 09:35:28,170
Just one of us needs to... No, there's none.

16370
09:35:28,310 --> 09:35:29,110
I don't see any.

16371
09:35:29,410 --> 09:35:30,010
Oh, there's a chicken.

16372
09:35:31,070 --> 09:35:32,030
Oh my God, there's a zombie?

16373
09:35:32,710 --> 09:35:33,150
Jumbo.

16374
09:35:33,910 --> 09:35:34,470
Come here, Jumbo.

16375
09:35:36,290 --> 09:35:37,890
You bust down doors.

16376
09:35:38,530 --> 09:35:39,470
I got a chicken.

16377
09:35:40,430 --> 09:35:41,790
And you also hit harder.

16378
09:35:42,070 --> 09:35:42,810
I don't like that.

16379
09:35:44,090 --> 09:35:45,330
I got a chicken.

16380
09:35:46,310 --> 09:35:48,770
Oh my God, I don't want to see another enderman ever again.

16381
09:35:49,630 --> 09:35:50,270
What the hell?

16382
09:35:51,110 --> 09:35:52,050
What is going on over there?

16383
09:35:52,110 --> 09:35:53,110
Oh, the iron golem.

16384
09:35:53,830 --> 09:35:55,050
I got a chicken.

16385
09:35:55,350 --> 09:35:56,890
Wait, there's no phantoms, you guys.

16386
09:35:57,050 --> 09:35:57,690
I don't think it...

16387
09:35:57,690 --> 09:35:58,410
Let's just walk.

16388
09:35:58,550 --> 09:35:59,010
Let's just...

16389
09:35:59,010 --> 09:36:00,390
What are you afraid of?

16390
09:36:00,410 --> 09:36:01,270
Let's just keep walking.

16391
09:36:01,790 --> 09:36:02,550
We'll keep walking.

16392
09:36:02,630 --> 09:36:03,410
What are you afraid of?

16393
09:36:03,430 --> 09:36:04,270
We're losing time.

16394
09:36:05,470 --> 09:36:06,370
Get over here.

16395
09:36:06,410 --> 09:36:07,330
We have diamond armor.

16396
09:36:07,410 --> 09:36:08,290
We can't die.

16397
09:36:10,350 --> 09:36:11,690
We're decked out in diamond.

16398
09:36:11,690 --> 09:36:12,650
Diamond, what are you scared of?

16399
09:36:15,290 --> 09:36:16,450
That's right, come on.

16400
09:36:17,190 --> 09:36:19,090
You're not even going the right way.

16401
09:36:19,710 --> 09:36:20,490
Oh my... Okay.

16402
09:36:22,210 --> 09:36:23,150
Oh my God.

16403
09:36:23,350 --> 09:36:25,030
You scared me so bad.

16404
09:36:25,690 --> 09:36:27,350
You're gonna turn into a zombie and I don't care.

16405
09:36:27,890 --> 09:36:28,190
What?

16406
09:36:28,330 --> 09:36:29,350
What are you talking about?

16407
09:36:29,570 --> 09:36:30,290
Where are you going?

16408
09:36:30,710 --> 09:36:32,470
I'm stealing this guy's bed.

16409
09:36:33,150 --> 09:36:34,470
Wait, are you going to sleep?

16410
09:36:35,010 --> 09:36:36,610
No, it's for the future.

16411
09:36:36,750 --> 09:36:39,290
Okay, for the future when we can sleep.

16412
09:36:39,290 --> 09:36:41,110
Where are the phantoms?

16413
09:36:41,850 --> 09:36:42,830
It doesn't work.

16414
09:36:42,910 --> 09:36:44,050
We gotta stay up even longer.

16415
09:36:44,050 --> 09:36:45,690
It doesn't work, you guys.

16416
09:36:49,470 --> 09:36:50,490
Alright, let's go.

16417
09:36:50,570 --> 09:36:51,870
These zombies don't hurt.

16418
09:36:52,110 --> 09:36:53,070
We have diamond armor.

16419
09:36:54,010 --> 09:36:54,250
Okay.

16420
09:36:54,930 --> 09:36:55,610
Alright, let's go.

16421
09:36:55,670 --> 09:36:55,950
Which way?

16422
09:36:57,470 --> 09:36:59,290
The way we were going in the boat.

16423
09:37:02,010 --> 09:37:02,490
Chicken!

16424
09:37:05,010 --> 09:37:05,990
I got the feather.

16425
09:37:06,470 --> 09:37:08,050
I think, yeah, I got feather.

16426
09:37:08,350 --> 09:37:09,130
Oh, there's more chickens?

16427
09:37:09,350 --> 09:37:10,270
Oh, there's lots of chickens here.

16428
09:37:10,430 --> 09:37:11,230
Oh, there's so many chickens.

16429
09:37:11,410 --> 09:37:14,150
Get over here, chickens.

16430
09:37:14,650 --> 09:37:16,290
I don't even need you for your meat.

16431
09:37:16,530 --> 09:37:18,650
I don't even need you for your meat here.

16432
09:37:18,970 --> 09:37:18,990
Kill!

16433
09:37:19,350 --> 09:37:19,830
Kill them!

16434
09:37:20,450 --> 09:37:21,110
Kill them!

16435
09:37:21,430 --> 09:37:22,550
We need magma cream, right?

16436
09:37:23,990 --> 09:37:25,890
I have three magma cream.

16437
09:37:26,490 --> 09:37:28,810
Okay, by the way, there's more magma cream on the...

16438
09:37:28,810 --> 09:37:30,090
on the area left.

16439
09:37:30,470 --> 09:37:31,190
Wait, where are we going?

16440
09:37:32,650 --> 09:37:33,690
Where did you go?

16441
09:37:34,610 --> 09:37:35,290
Oh, I see.

16442
09:37:35,370 --> 09:37:36,170
Is that the right way?

16443
09:37:36,990 --> 09:37:38,810
Yeah, I'm scared of the skellies.

16444
09:37:39,550 --> 09:37:41,170
Oh my god, we're diamond armored.

16445
09:37:41,350 --> 09:37:42,370
Don't nothing to be afraid of.

16446
09:37:42,390 --> 09:37:42,850
Just go.

16447
09:37:44,510 --> 09:37:45,690
There it is!

16448
09:37:48,550 --> 09:37:49,350
Okay, um...

16449
09:37:49,350 --> 09:37:49,890
Uh-oh.

16450
09:37:50,910 --> 09:37:51,730
Are you alive?

16451
09:37:52,690 --> 09:37:53,690
I'm just running.

16452
09:37:54,530 --> 09:37:54,850
I'm just running.

16453
09:37:55,010 --> 09:37:55,450
Oh, shit.

16454
09:37:55,830 --> 09:37:57,790
I thought you were supposed to be bad.

16455
09:37:58,730 --> 09:37:59,650
You're dealing with the phantom?

16456
09:37:59,650 --> 09:38:01,070
Yeah, I'm dealing with the phantom.

16457
09:38:02,370 --> 09:38:03,550
I don't have one.

16458
09:38:04,570 --> 09:38:05,210
Do I?

16459
09:38:06,330 --> 09:38:07,670
Oh, I see you fighting yours.

16460
09:38:07,850 --> 09:38:09,190
Your demons, your phantom demons.

16461
09:38:09,550 --> 09:38:11,050
My nightmares are here.

16462
09:38:13,230 --> 09:38:13,970
Oh, chicken.

16463
09:38:16,230 --> 09:38:16,990
I got one of them.

16464
09:38:17,810 --> 09:38:18,990
How do you have multiple?

16465
09:38:19,730 --> 09:38:21,430
What do I need from the phantom?

16466
09:38:21,690 --> 09:38:22,550
Their membranes!

16467
09:38:22,690 --> 09:38:23,590
Their membranes!

16468
09:38:25,230 --> 09:38:26,650
Collect their membranes!

16469
09:38:26,650 --> 09:38:28,470
Oh my god, there it is.

16470
09:38:29,210 --> 09:38:30,750
I don't need this anymore.

16471
09:38:30,850 --> 09:38:31,450
I got one.

16472
09:38:32,030 --> 09:38:32,910
Alright, let's go.

16473
09:38:32,970 --> 09:38:33,510
Let's keep going.

16474
09:38:33,610 --> 09:38:34,350
Wait, where did you go?

16475
09:38:34,610 --> 09:38:35,750
I went further!

16476
09:38:35,970 --> 09:38:37,710
Because I was dealing with the skellies.

16477
09:38:38,770 --> 09:38:39,790
I'm killing chickens.

16478
09:38:39,950 --> 09:38:40,550
I'm killing chickens.

16479
09:38:40,790 --> 09:38:43,090
Alright, I'm gonna see if I can find you.

16480
09:38:44,270 --> 09:38:46,070
I don't trust you.

16481
09:38:46,310 --> 09:38:47,130
Oh, there you are.

16482
09:38:47,490 --> 09:38:48,630
Yeah, I just went straight.

16483
09:38:48,730 --> 09:38:48,990
I see you.

16484
09:38:49,310 --> 09:38:54,010
I gotta get my cough drops.

16485
09:38:54,010 --> 09:38:54,710
Oh god.

16486
09:38:55,630 --> 09:38:55,990
Alright.

16487
09:38:59,750 --> 09:39:02,210
Look behind me and see if there's anybody behind me.

16488
09:39:02,430 --> 09:39:03,390
No, you're good.

16489
09:39:03,590 --> 09:39:04,310
Alright, let's go.

16490
09:39:04,970 --> 09:39:06,310
We keep traveling.

16491
09:39:08,770 --> 09:39:09,730
Ignore everybody.

16492
09:39:09,790 --> 09:39:10,570
I do have a boat.

16493
09:39:10,830 --> 09:39:13,710
If I do the boat and we go that way, is it correct?

16494
09:39:14,230 --> 09:39:15,310
It should be, yeah.

16495
09:39:16,110 --> 09:39:17,010
Let's go on the boat.

16496
09:39:17,330 --> 09:39:18,570
It's boat time.

16497
09:39:18,570 --> 09:39:19,490
Boating time.

16498
09:39:21,610 --> 09:39:22,270
Alright.

16499
09:39:22,370 --> 09:39:23,370
Go, go, go!

16500
09:39:23,850 --> 09:39:25,030
I'm rowing.

16501
09:39:25,230 --> 09:39:26,430
I'm rowing!

16502
09:39:26,790 --> 09:39:30,430
Let me know if I'm going the right way.

16503
09:39:32,380 --> 09:39:33,470
No, you're not.

16504
09:39:34,610 --> 09:39:35,190
Ok, hold on.

16505
09:39:36,190 --> 09:39:37,130
What are the numbers?

16506
09:39:37,890 --> 09:39:38,990
Let me drive.

16507
09:39:39,450 --> 09:39:40,290
Let me drive.

16508
09:39:43,030 --> 09:39:43,690
Hello?

16509
09:39:43,690 --> 09:39:44,610
Hello?

16510
09:39:46,070 --> 09:39:46,710
There we go.

16511
09:39:47,930 --> 09:39:48,950
I'm ok now.

16512
09:39:49,110 --> 09:39:49,670
I'm ok.

16513
09:39:50,270 --> 09:39:51,990
I'm figuring it out.

16514
09:39:52,290 --> 09:39:53,250
It's almost day.

16515
09:39:54,910 --> 09:39:55,530
Ok, this one.

16516
09:39:56,690 --> 09:39:59,010
But also not for the...

16517
09:39:59,010 --> 09:40:01,110
How do I get the Z to go down?

16518
09:40:04,070 --> 09:40:05,670
Z is the scariest part.

16519
09:40:05,670 --> 09:40:06,070
I know!

16520
09:40:07,690 --> 09:40:10,430
Oh my god, I can only get the X to go down.

16521
09:40:10,970 --> 09:40:11,950
Ok, let me drive.

16522
09:40:11,950 --> 09:40:12,310
Hold on.

16523
09:40:12,330 --> 09:40:12,790
No, no, no.

16524
09:40:12,890 --> 09:40:13,290
I got it.

16525
09:40:13,710 --> 09:40:14,550
I got it.

16526
09:40:14,990 --> 09:40:15,530
I got it.

16527
09:40:15,550 --> 09:40:18,010
I had to go around this island.

16528
09:40:18,450 --> 09:40:18,990
Ok, we're good.

16529
09:40:19,370 --> 09:40:22,190
We're going northeast.

16530
09:40:22,770 --> 09:40:25,410
If we're not going northeast, we're going the wrong direction.

16531
09:40:25,590 --> 09:40:27,950
So every time, we have to be going northeast.

16532
09:40:28,290 --> 09:40:28,430
Ok?

16533
09:40:29,410 --> 09:40:30,190
Say ok!

16534
09:40:30,450 --> 09:40:31,050
You understand?

16535
09:40:31,390 --> 09:40:32,590
Say northeast!

16536
09:40:33,130 --> 09:40:34,150
Say northeast!

16537
09:40:35,590 --> 09:40:36,070
Northeast!

16538
09:40:36,930 --> 09:40:38,510
Happy birthday to Mr. Kimchi!

16539
09:40:39,250 --> 09:40:40,090
Who's Kimchi?

16540
09:40:40,750 --> 09:40:41,250
I don't know.

16541
09:40:41,450 --> 09:40:42,890
He's my dragoon in my chat.

16542
09:40:43,350 --> 09:40:44,230
Happy birthday!

16543
09:40:45,250 --> 09:40:45,890
Nice, ok.

16544
09:40:46,550 --> 09:40:47,470
Say his name!

16545
09:40:48,230 --> 09:40:49,070
Mr. Kimchi!

16546
09:40:51,150 --> 09:40:52,050
There you go.

16547
09:40:52,230 --> 09:40:53,670
Thank you for the super chat, Mr. Kimchi.

16548
09:40:54,090 --> 09:40:54,470
Thank you.

16549
09:40:55,890 --> 09:40:57,770
Oh gosh, ok.

16550
09:40:58,410 --> 09:40:59,670
This is tougher than I...

16551
09:40:59,670 --> 09:41:01,030
We can't vote.

16552
09:41:01,330 --> 09:41:03,370
We have to walk!

16553
09:41:04,390 --> 09:41:05,010
What are the numbers?

16554
09:41:05,010 --> 09:41:05,790
What are the numbers?

16555
09:41:06,850 --> 09:41:08,190
What do you mean the numbers?

16556
09:41:08,330 --> 09:41:09,550
Ok, we just need to go down.

16557
09:41:10,730 --> 09:41:11,510
That's fine.

16558
09:41:12,350 --> 09:41:13,350
Get out of the boat.

16559
09:41:16,110 --> 09:41:17,030
Ok, let's go.

16560
09:41:19,630 --> 09:41:20,130
Alright.

16561
09:41:21,970 --> 09:41:23,390
How many feathers do I have?

16562
09:41:23,530 --> 09:41:24,590
Oh, only 8 feathers.

16563
09:41:25,070 --> 09:41:26,010
We'll find more.

16564
09:41:27,090 --> 09:41:27,770
We didn't...

16565
09:41:27,770 --> 09:41:29,790
We didn't fucking check for hay bales.

16566
09:41:30,670 --> 09:41:31,590
Oh no!

16567
09:41:32,730 --> 09:41:33,210
Oh...

16568
09:41:33,210 --> 09:41:33,430
Ok.

16569
09:41:33,790 --> 09:41:36,130
I have 15...

16570
09:41:38,450 --> 09:41:39,410
15 blam.

16571
09:41:39,890 --> 09:41:42,090
Ok, I have...

16572
09:41:42,090 --> 09:41:43,710
Wait, did you grab a bed yet or no?

16573
09:41:43,890 --> 09:41:45,090
Yeah, I've had my bed.

16574
09:41:46,010 --> 09:41:46,330
Oh.

16575
09:41:46,690 --> 09:41:48,370
How many membranes do you have?

16576
09:41:48,690 --> 09:41:49,350
I have one.

16577
09:41:49,930 --> 09:41:50,890
That's not enough.

16578
09:41:52,770 --> 09:41:53,570
Where are you going?

16579
09:41:53,630 --> 09:41:54,130
Come on!

16580
09:41:54,410 --> 09:41:55,450
This is the way!

16581
09:41:55,570 --> 09:41:56,290
No, up!

16582
09:41:56,410 --> 09:41:56,870
This way!

16583
09:41:56,870 --> 09:41:57,510
It is!

16584
09:41:57,670 --> 09:41:58,370
Look where I'm...

16585
09:41:58,370 --> 09:41:59,110
It's going down!

16586
09:42:00,910 --> 09:42:02,610
I'm going down too!

16587
09:42:04,930 --> 09:42:06,310
And I'm going up the mountain!

16588
09:42:07,410 --> 09:42:08,030
I'm at the...

16589
09:42:08,030 --> 09:42:09,210
Oh my god, ok.

16590
09:42:09,870 --> 09:42:11,430
Alright, alright.

16591
09:42:12,410 --> 09:42:13,530
I wish I had...

16592
09:42:14,190 --> 09:42:14,990
Where are you?

16593
09:42:15,670 --> 09:42:16,170
What?

16594
09:42:16,370 --> 09:42:17,030
What happened?

16595
09:42:17,330 --> 09:42:17,670
What's wrong?

16596
09:42:18,470 --> 09:42:19,370
Oh my god.

16597
09:42:20,590 --> 09:42:21,690
Who did you tame?

16598
09:42:21,790 --> 09:42:22,330
The dog?

16599
09:42:23,450 --> 09:42:24,910
Actually, this might be really good.

16600
09:42:24,910 --> 09:42:27,310
Because we'll be awake and we need someone to kill the skellies.

16601
09:42:27,890 --> 09:42:28,430
Yeah, exactly.

16602
09:42:28,610 --> 09:42:29,410
Where are you?

16603
09:42:29,530 --> 09:42:30,590
I lost you already.

16604
09:42:30,910 --> 09:42:31,830
I already lost you.

16605
09:42:32,090 --> 09:42:33,350
Yeah, because you're focused on dog.

16606
09:42:34,570 --> 09:42:35,550
Are you going up the mountain?

16607
09:42:36,250 --> 09:42:37,410
Why are you going up the mountain?

16608
09:42:37,510 --> 09:42:38,890
It makes the Z go up!

16609
09:42:39,170 --> 09:42:40,110
No, it doesn't!

16610
09:42:40,410 --> 09:42:41,110
Yes, it does!

16611
09:42:41,210 --> 09:42:44,750
I'm literally going up the mountain...

16612
09:42:44,750 --> 09:42:46,750
and my Z is going down!

16613
09:42:47,090 --> 09:42:47,350
Three...

16614
09:42:47,350 --> 09:42:48,070
Where are you?

16615
09:42:48,270 --> 09:42:49,130
Where are you?

16616
09:42:49,130 --> 09:42:50,410
Let's do this way.

16617
09:42:51,290 --> 09:42:52,190
Where are you?

16618
09:42:53,430 --> 09:42:54,890
I'm across the mountain.

16619
09:42:55,690 --> 09:42:56,710
We lost each other.

16620
09:42:56,910 --> 09:42:57,970
I'll meet you on the...

16621
09:42:57,970 --> 09:43:00,610
We actually lost each other.

16622
09:43:03,950 --> 09:43:05,770
I'm going down the mountain.

16623
09:43:06,330 --> 09:43:07,570
Oh wait, there's water here!

16624
09:43:08,050 --> 09:43:08,850
We lost each other.

16625
09:43:08,850 --> 09:43:09,330
Ok, hold on.

16626
09:43:09,390 --> 09:43:11,890
I'll give you my coordinates and you come to the water and then we vote.

16627
09:43:12,670 --> 09:43:13,930
I'm literally in the water.

16628
09:43:14,270 --> 09:43:14,910
Where are you?

16629
09:43:14,990 --> 09:43:15,570
Come to me!

16630
09:43:16,450 --> 09:43:17,350
What's your coordinates?

16631
09:43:17,350 --> 09:43:18,350
Oh, I see you.

16632
09:43:18,730 --> 09:43:20,810
Oh my god, we were heading the same way!

16633
09:43:21,390 --> 09:43:23,330
Wait, we can't take the boat!

16634
09:43:23,430 --> 09:43:23,990
You're dog!

16635
09:43:25,190 --> 09:43:25,950
He'll fall!

16636
09:43:26,050 --> 09:43:26,510
He'll TP!

16637
09:43:26,970 --> 09:43:28,790
Ok, ok, ok.

16638
09:43:28,810 --> 09:43:29,790
Alright, go, go, go!

16639
09:43:32,810 --> 09:43:33,910
Nope, wrong way.

16640
09:43:34,710 --> 09:43:35,550
It's going down!

16641
09:43:36,490 --> 09:43:37,790
It's going down!

16642
09:43:38,550 --> 09:43:41,510
No, the X axis is not going down!

16643
09:43:42,950 --> 09:43:44,950
Oh my god, we gotta get off the boat.

16644
09:43:44,950 --> 09:43:45,990
We gotta get off the boat.

16645
09:43:45,990 --> 09:43:47,290
We gotta get off the boat.

16646
09:43:47,410 --> 09:43:49,170
We gotta get off the boat.

16647
09:43:49,310 --> 09:43:51,630
We go this way.

16648
09:43:52,030 --> 09:43:53,330
We go this way.

16649
09:43:54,170 --> 09:43:55,710
Oh my god.

16650
09:43:56,570 --> 09:43:57,570
We go this way.

16651
09:43:57,630 --> 09:43:58,410
We go northeast.

16652
09:43:58,690 --> 09:43:59,590
You guys follow me.

16653
09:43:59,690 --> 09:44:00,470
Just follow me.

16654
09:44:00,650 --> 09:44:00,970
Northeast!

16655
09:44:02,990 --> 09:44:04,710
Northeast right here!

16656
09:44:04,930 --> 09:44:05,430
Northeast!

16657
09:44:08,790 --> 09:44:10,750
It's going down now!

16658
09:44:10,750 --> 09:44:11,010
Woo!

16659
09:44:14,530 --> 09:44:16,510
No ghasts in sight!

16660
09:44:17,010 --> 09:44:18,150
This is a peaceful time.

16661
09:44:18,170 --> 09:44:19,790
It's just a peaceful day.

16662
09:44:20,210 --> 09:44:23,330
Yeah, we have piggies, and dogs, and sheep.

16663
09:44:23,650 --> 09:44:25,170
No ghasts, no lava.

16664
09:44:25,450 --> 09:44:26,610
I mean, sometimes maybe lava.

16665
09:44:27,030 --> 09:44:27,730
But nothing else.

16666
09:44:28,410 --> 09:44:30,170
Just keep going down.

16667
09:44:31,010 --> 09:44:32,930
A freaky teleporting dog.

16668
09:44:34,010 --> 09:44:35,710
There he is!

16669
09:44:35,730 --> 09:44:39,350
A dog that is literally defying all physics and logic.

16670
09:44:40,270 --> 09:44:41,250
Oh my god.

16671
09:44:41,290 --> 09:44:42,870
He's gonna start teleporting.

16672
09:44:43,010 --> 09:44:44,630
Our good little boy.

16673
09:44:44,710 --> 09:44:47,350
He's been teleporting.

16674
09:44:48,190 --> 09:44:49,270
He's been teleporting.

16675
09:44:50,550 --> 09:44:51,390
We never stop.

16676
09:44:52,170 --> 09:44:53,670
We never stop going.

16677
09:44:56,510 --> 09:44:59,430
What we did was to find the fortress.

16678
09:44:59,850 --> 09:45:01,590
We found the fortress though!

16679
09:45:02,130 --> 09:45:04,970
We found the fortress!

16680
09:45:05,510 --> 09:45:06,890
We found it!

16681
09:45:06,890 --> 09:45:08,170
We found it!

16682
09:45:08,170 --> 09:45:09,470
We found the fortress!

16683
09:45:10,270 --> 09:45:11,490
Isn't that great?

16684
09:45:17,850 --> 09:45:19,370
Oh my god.

16685
09:45:19,910 --> 09:45:23,390
I feel like it's not going down.

16686
09:45:23,750 --> 09:45:27,170
I wish we had a light rule.

16687
09:45:29,750 --> 09:45:32,770
We need to go to the end for that.

16688
09:45:38,750 --> 09:45:41,470
At least it's going down though.

16689
09:45:42,170 --> 09:45:44,670
I keep losing you, but I keep seeing your dog.

16690
09:45:44,790 --> 09:45:45,950
So I'm just following your dog.

16691
09:45:46,730 --> 09:45:49,910
TP to me, so I don't know what you're talking about.

16692
09:45:51,050 --> 09:45:52,950
How are you behind?

16693
09:45:54,250 --> 09:45:54,950
I'm right here.

16694
09:45:55,210 --> 09:45:57,170
I'm literally going...

16695
09:45:57,870 --> 09:45:59,970
I'm following the coordinates.

16696
09:46:00,410 --> 09:46:01,610
I'm following you.

16697
09:46:01,950 --> 09:46:03,170
Come on, make a path.

16698
09:46:03,170 --> 09:46:04,570
A freaking hole.

16699
09:46:05,490 --> 09:46:05,790
Jump.

16700
09:46:11,330 --> 09:46:13,990
We have to do so much in this.

16701
09:46:14,110 --> 09:46:14,990
Oh my god.

16702
09:46:15,130 --> 09:46:15,990
Oh my god.

16703
09:46:16,190 --> 09:46:18,010
We have to do so much.

16704
09:46:19,570 --> 09:46:20,510
Another mountain.

16705
09:46:20,910 --> 09:46:22,670
Oh, the dog just shook off the water!

16706
09:46:22,770 --> 09:46:23,450
That was so cute!

16707
09:46:25,270 --> 09:46:28,330
That's why I've been trying to team the dog this entire time.

16708
09:46:28,450 --> 09:46:28,850
Oh my god.

16709
09:46:28,990 --> 09:46:30,350
We need him for the night time.

16710
09:46:30,350 --> 09:46:31,570
For sure.

16711
09:46:32,730 --> 09:46:33,370
I mean, we need...

16712
09:46:33,370 --> 09:46:36,030
We needed to farm other stuff anyway.

16713
09:46:36,510 --> 09:46:37,150
So it's alright.

16714
09:46:37,290 --> 09:46:38,770
We needed to farm the chickens.

16715
09:46:39,110 --> 09:46:41,310
We needed to farm the bookshelves.

16716
09:46:41,670 --> 09:46:43,750
We needed so many things.

16717
09:46:43,850 --> 09:46:44,250
It's alright.

16718
09:46:44,490 --> 09:46:45,850
Maybe we'll find another village.

16719
09:46:46,130 --> 09:46:48,050
We'll find another village somewhere.

16720
09:46:49,710 --> 09:46:50,990
We'll find another village somewhere.

16721
09:46:51,570 --> 09:46:52,690
We'll find it.

16722
09:46:52,850 --> 09:46:54,490
Oh god, please.

16723
09:46:55,310 --> 09:46:56,190
Look, we're at 9k.

16724
09:46:56,190 --> 09:46:57,130
We're at 9k.

16725
09:46:57,290 --> 09:46:58,790
We're getting there.

16726
09:46:59,230 --> 09:47:02,350
But the 12k is scaring me.

16727
09:47:03,290 --> 09:47:04,370
Don't think about it.

16728
09:47:04,670 --> 09:47:06,690
It seems to be 4k.

16729
09:47:07,590 --> 09:47:08,470
Don't think about it.

16730
09:47:08,490 --> 09:47:09,210
It's not as bad.

16731
09:47:09,370 --> 09:47:09,890
I get 4k.

16732
09:47:09,890 --> 09:47:10,970
Don't think about it.

16733
09:47:11,350 --> 09:47:13,010
It's negative 4k.

16734
09:47:13,310 --> 09:47:15,370
Yeah, negative 4k.

16735
09:47:15,450 --> 09:47:16,490
Don't go this way.

16736
09:47:17,350 --> 09:47:19,870
My coordinates almost blocked that for me.

16737
09:47:20,110 --> 09:47:22,270
My coordinates almost blocked that for me.

16738
09:47:23,230 --> 09:47:24,590
Uh oh, you just trapped your dog.

16739
09:47:24,590 --> 09:47:25,570
It's fine.

16740
09:47:25,650 --> 09:47:26,710
He'll TP out.

16741
09:47:29,010 --> 09:47:30,090
He'll TP out.

16742
09:47:30,150 --> 09:47:30,810
It'll be fine.

16743
09:47:31,630 --> 09:47:32,750
It'll be fine.

16744
09:47:34,990 --> 09:47:38,070
It'll be so fine.

16745
09:47:38,470 --> 09:47:40,010
We keep moving forward.

16746
09:47:40,250 --> 09:47:41,890
We had to find bookshelves.

16747
09:47:42,230 --> 09:47:43,930
We had to get chicken feathers.

16748
09:47:44,350 --> 09:47:45,710
We had to get so many things.

16749
09:47:45,810 --> 09:47:47,630
This is all part of the plan.

16750
09:47:48,270 --> 09:47:50,030
This is all part of the plan, everybody.

16751
09:47:50,730 --> 09:47:51,550
This is all part of the plan.

16752
09:47:51,550 --> 09:47:53,850
We had to get so many other resources anyway.

16753
09:47:54,010 --> 09:47:55,570
So we might as well make the travel.

16754
09:47:55,830 --> 09:47:57,990
But from here on, we did the fortress.

16755
09:47:58,170 --> 09:47:59,950
We did the most difficult part probably.

16756
09:48:00,310 --> 09:48:01,970
Hopefully, maybe that's the most difficult part.

16757
09:48:02,270 --> 09:48:05,810
We just have to get to the...

16758
09:48:06,510 --> 09:48:07,750
What's the thing?

16759
09:48:07,930 --> 09:48:09,410
Oh my god, we should have been farming sheep.

16760
09:48:09,530 --> 09:48:10,950
We should have been farming sheep for the bed.

16761
09:48:11,670 --> 09:48:12,990
You have a bed.

16762
09:48:14,070 --> 09:48:15,690
For the Ender Dragon!

16763
09:48:18,070 --> 09:48:19,250
I'm gonna kill this chicken.

16764
09:48:20,230 --> 09:48:21,250
Why do you want to go back?

16765
09:48:21,490 --> 09:48:24,270
We can farm beds when we find more villagers.

16766
09:48:24,430 --> 09:48:25,750
I feel like it's easier to just get wool.

16767
09:48:26,070 --> 09:48:27,830
Because we don't have enough inventory space anyway.

16768
09:48:28,230 --> 09:48:29,350
I feel like it's just easier.

16769
09:48:29,850 --> 09:48:31,250
I feel like let's just farm the sheep.

16770
09:48:31,350 --> 09:48:32,890
Do you have inventory space for sheep, wool?

16771
09:48:34,110 --> 09:48:34,510
No.

16772
09:48:35,590 --> 09:48:36,670
Alright, let's see.

16773
09:48:36,910 --> 09:48:38,230
What can I get rid of?

16774
09:48:39,110 --> 09:48:40,390
I'll farm the wool.

16775
09:48:40,790 --> 09:48:43,490
I mean, we don't have to do the bed strat, but...

16776
09:48:43,490 --> 09:48:45,270
I mean...

16777
09:48:46,250 --> 09:48:47,410
Save this right now.

16778
09:48:47,410 --> 09:48:48,670
Wait, someone sent me something.

16779
09:48:48,810 --> 09:48:50,470
And people are like, she needs to read this.

16780
09:48:52,050 --> 09:48:54,430
Oh, YouTube Live Archive.

16781
09:48:54,530 --> 09:48:56,410
Yes, we know about the 12 hours minimum.

16782
09:48:56,530 --> 09:48:57,390
We know, we know.

16783
09:48:57,630 --> 09:48:58,370
We're only at 10!

16784
09:48:58,770 --> 09:49:00,030
We're at 10 hours!

16785
09:49:00,170 --> 09:49:03,010
We're not even thinking about this!

16786
09:49:04,470 --> 09:49:04,950
We're fine.

16787
09:49:05,770 --> 09:49:07,010
It takes us literally...

16788
09:49:07,010 --> 09:49:09,370
10 minutes to make another room.

16789
09:49:10,170 --> 09:49:11,390
We'll be fine.

16790
09:49:11,570 --> 09:49:12,330
We'll be fine.

16791
09:49:13,470 --> 09:49:14,690
Where did you go?

16792
09:49:15,650 --> 09:49:16,450
I don't know.

16793
09:49:17,790 --> 09:49:19,090
Wait, you're still going?

16794
09:49:19,250 --> 09:49:20,170
I thought you were hunting sheep.

16795
09:49:20,590 --> 09:49:21,070
No, I'm not.

16796
09:49:21,270 --> 09:49:22,530
It was in the path.

16797
09:49:23,310 --> 09:49:23,750
No!

16798
09:49:24,350 --> 09:49:25,030
I lost you.

16799
09:49:25,270 --> 09:49:25,650
I lost you.

16800
09:49:26,290 --> 09:49:28,790
I'm making a PP tower right now.

16801
09:49:28,830 --> 09:49:29,330
Oh, I see you.

16802
09:49:30,330 --> 09:49:31,430
Alright, look up.

16803
09:49:31,670 --> 09:49:33,510
I see it being made.

16804
09:49:34,450 --> 09:49:35,570
Don't keep going.

16805
09:49:35,850 --> 09:49:36,410
Wait for me.

16806
09:49:36,870 --> 09:49:37,430
Wait for me.

16807
09:49:38,990 --> 09:49:40,690
I'm gonna put red blocks.

16808
09:49:41,370 --> 09:49:42,790
Follow the red block road.

16809
09:49:42,790 --> 09:49:44,810
Follow the red block road.

16810
09:49:44,910 --> 09:49:46,450
Follow the red block road.

16811
09:49:46,690 --> 09:49:50,960
Follow the red block road.

16812
09:49:51,060 --> 09:49:51,960
I gotta eat my bread.

16813
09:49:52,200 --> 09:49:53,660
I'm eating my bread.

16814
09:49:53,980 --> 09:49:54,640
I'm eating my bread.

16815
09:49:56,300 --> 09:49:57,240
I'm eating my bread.

16816
09:49:58,000 --> 09:50:03,600
I placed all my very important belongings back home.

16817
09:50:03,740 --> 09:50:04,620
For some reason.

16818
09:50:05,300 --> 09:50:07,360
Because she thought that...

16819
09:50:07,360 --> 09:50:09,020
I thought we would go back.

16820
09:50:09,340 --> 09:50:09,960
Silly me.

16821
09:50:10,800 --> 09:50:12,300
We were never coming back.

16822
09:50:12,300 --> 09:50:15,660
We had several blocks of lapis.

16823
09:50:15,820 --> 09:50:17,080
And we also had...

16824
09:50:17,080 --> 09:50:18,760
We also had...

16825
09:50:18,760 --> 09:50:20,040
Some of our ender stuff.

16826
09:50:20,160 --> 09:50:20,680
But it's okay.

16827
09:50:20,800 --> 09:50:22,420
We had to farm other stuff anyway.

16828
09:50:22,600 --> 09:50:23,700
We had to farm the wool.

16829
09:50:23,820 --> 09:50:24,820
We had to farm chicken.

16830
09:50:25,160 --> 09:50:26,380
We had to get bookshelves.

16831
09:50:26,600 --> 09:50:27,260
It's okay.

16832
09:50:27,520 --> 09:50:29,260
It was part of the plan.

16833
09:50:33,220 --> 09:50:35,240
Is there anything else you want to add, Mint?

16834
09:50:35,340 --> 09:50:36,800
Is there anything else about my mistake?

16835
09:50:38,700 --> 09:50:40,200
I just want to say...

16836
09:50:40,200 --> 09:50:43,580
There's no point in putting things in a chest.

16837
09:50:43,820 --> 09:50:47,940
If we just delete everything when we die.

16838
09:50:49,040 --> 09:50:51,720
Keep all important belongings.

16839
09:50:52,180 --> 09:50:53,300
I thought we were coming back.

16840
09:50:53,480 --> 09:50:55,080
I legitimately thought we were going to come back.

16841
09:50:55,260 --> 09:50:58,520
That it wouldn't take us 20 fucking years to get to a fortress.

16842
09:50:58,840 --> 09:51:01,260
I legitimately thought that we were more competent than that.

16843
09:51:01,440 --> 09:51:06,320
It's not our fault that the fortress decided to just not spawn.

16844
09:51:07,120 --> 09:51:07,940
It's so easy to get to the fortress.

16845
09:51:07,940 --> 09:51:11,660
It's so easy to find a fortress.

16846
09:51:11,900 --> 09:51:12,880
But don't silly me.

16847
09:51:13,100 --> 09:51:14,020
It wasn't easy.

16848
09:51:14,260 --> 09:51:17,120
It wasn't easy at all.

16849
09:51:18,500 --> 09:51:22,680
I think we just hit the negative luck with the fortress.

16850
09:51:25,600 --> 09:51:26,940
Just keep running.

16851
09:51:27,280 --> 09:51:28,100
Just keep running.

16852
09:51:28,880 --> 09:51:31,620
It's going to be night time, but that's okay.

16853
09:51:31,820 --> 09:51:32,440
Sakura!

16854
09:51:34,420 --> 09:51:35,540
The cherry blossom trees.

16855
09:51:35,540 --> 09:51:37,060
We don't need it.

16856
09:51:37,140 --> 09:51:38,280
It's not part of the speed run.

16857
09:51:38,380 --> 09:51:38,940
Wait, oh my gosh.

16858
09:51:39,000 --> 09:51:39,940
There's another portal.

16859
09:51:40,300 --> 09:51:41,300
We broke another portal.

16860
09:51:41,720 --> 09:51:43,320
I'm going.

16861
09:51:44,740 --> 09:51:46,300
But it would be closer.

16862
09:51:47,280 --> 09:51:48,360
It would be closer.

16863
09:51:48,600 --> 09:51:52,420
I'm not gacha rolling 200 rolls.

16864
09:51:52,860 --> 09:51:55,600
I am not doing that again.

16865
09:51:55,760 --> 09:51:56,500
We don't have to.

16866
09:51:56,560 --> 09:51:58,080
We just have to find the original.

16867
09:52:00,340 --> 09:52:01,420
We'll make it.

16868
09:52:01,420 --> 09:52:04,640
With all the gas.

16869
09:52:04,640 --> 09:52:06,500
With all the gas.

16870
09:52:07,240 --> 09:52:07,640
Yeah.

16871
09:52:09,200 --> 09:52:10,260
We could do it.

16872
09:52:12,360 --> 09:52:14,040
We could do it.

16873
09:52:14,140 --> 09:52:15,280
I like how you just destroyed it.

16874
09:52:17,560 --> 09:52:17,960
What?

16875
09:52:18,920 --> 09:52:19,760
This is a team.

16876
09:52:19,880 --> 09:52:21,500
What are you trying to split us up for?

16877
09:52:24,900 --> 09:52:26,220
Are we going the right way?

16878
09:52:26,480 --> 09:52:27,500
Oh my god, I just fell.

16879
09:52:28,820 --> 09:52:29,880
I just fell.

16880
09:52:30,060 --> 09:52:30,640
I'm okay.

16881
09:52:31,000 --> 09:52:31,720
No, I'm not okay.

16882
09:52:31,720 --> 09:52:32,280
I'm okay.

16883
09:52:32,540 --> 09:52:33,240
I think I'm okay.

16884
09:52:33,400 --> 09:52:35,620
Okay, because I'm heading straight.

16885
09:52:36,120 --> 09:52:37,760
I'll wait for you here.

16886
09:52:37,880 --> 09:52:39,300
No, I'm right behind you.

16887
09:52:39,720 --> 09:52:40,160
I'm right here.

16888
09:52:40,600 --> 09:52:43,780
I'm going to get the coordinates out of my screen.

16889
09:52:44,480 --> 09:52:45,640
And I'm going to head this way.

16890
09:52:45,860 --> 09:52:46,620
It's still the right way.

16891
09:52:46,720 --> 09:52:47,260
It's northeast.

16892
09:52:47,400 --> 09:52:48,260
I haven't stopped moving northeast.

16893
09:52:48,260 --> 09:52:49,820
We haven't stopped moving northeast.

16894
09:52:50,000 --> 09:52:52,160
Why does my screen do that with the colors?

16895
09:52:52,160 --> 09:52:54,440
We haven't stopped moving northeast.

16896
09:52:54,760 --> 09:52:56,980
So it's going to be the right way.

16897
09:52:57,420 --> 09:52:58,600
I fell into water.

16898
09:52:58,740 --> 09:52:59,340
It's fine, guys.

16899
09:53:00,000 --> 09:53:03,380
I never thought I'd catch a stream that started at 5 AM.

16900
09:53:04,180 --> 09:53:05,620
It's so funny, isn't it?

16901
09:53:07,280 --> 09:53:09,440
Oh my god, you got the spiders coming after us?

16902
09:53:09,520 --> 09:53:09,980
Oh shit.

16903
09:53:10,400 --> 09:53:11,120
It's fine.

16904
09:53:11,220 --> 09:53:12,020
I'm going northeast.

16905
09:53:12,940 --> 09:53:14,120
I'm going northeast.

16906
09:53:14,840 --> 09:53:16,400
Could your dog do something?

16907
09:53:16,600 --> 09:53:18,240
Because my dog!

16908
09:53:18,340 --> 09:53:19,480
Because I didn't get hit yet!

16909
09:53:19,920 --> 09:53:21,640
Okay, now the dog is going to do something.

16910
09:53:21,740 --> 09:53:22,380
There he goes.

16911
09:53:23,020 --> 09:53:24,240
Go, dog, go.

16912
09:53:24,340 --> 09:53:26,560
I'm stuck in the fucking dirt now.

16913
09:53:29,340 --> 09:53:29,640
It's fine.

16914
09:53:29,700 --> 09:53:30,800
My dog will be okay.

16915
09:53:31,300 --> 09:53:31,800
Where are you?

16916
09:53:31,920 --> 09:53:32,240
Come on.

16917
09:53:33,540 --> 09:53:34,340
My dog!

16918
09:53:34,600 --> 09:53:35,260
Oh, there he is.

16919
09:53:35,460 --> 09:53:35,860
What?

16920
09:53:36,820 --> 09:53:37,480
Did you kill your dog?

16921
09:53:38,020 --> 09:53:39,060
No, there's a hole here.

16922
09:53:39,100 --> 09:53:40,040
My dog is doing fine.

16923
09:53:40,540 --> 09:53:41,720
I'm just making sure.

16924
09:53:42,800 --> 09:53:43,840
I'm going to check the coordinates.

16925
09:53:44,080 --> 09:53:45,360
Phantom, don't go!

16926
09:53:45,520 --> 09:53:48,760
Phantom, come from the sky!

16927
09:53:49,240 --> 09:53:49,960
I call thee!

16928
09:53:52,500 --> 09:53:54,300
I don't think he's coming down from the sky.

16929
09:53:54,600 --> 09:53:56,760
I thought I heard a creeper.

16930
09:53:57,480 --> 09:53:58,280
I'm heading...

16931
09:53:58,280 --> 09:53:59,680
Oh, there's so many chickens.

16932
09:53:59,880 --> 09:54:00,820
And a spitter.

16933
09:54:02,880 --> 09:54:03,520
I got him.

16934
09:54:04,980 --> 09:54:07,140
Going northeast, going northeast.

16935
09:54:07,140 --> 09:54:07,720
Took his ass out.

16936
09:54:08,060 --> 09:54:09,720
There's more chickens here.

16937
09:54:10,200 --> 09:54:12,040
I want to make sure we are heading the right way.

16938
09:54:12,900 --> 09:54:13,760
Watch out for this.

16939
09:54:14,780 --> 09:54:15,160
Oh my god.

16940
09:54:16,240 --> 09:54:17,140
That's fine.

16941
09:54:20,460 --> 09:54:21,620
Get killed...

16942
09:54:22,280 --> 09:54:22,660
Skeleman.

16943
09:54:24,500 --> 09:54:25,920
I helped their dog.

16944
09:54:25,920 --> 09:54:26,720
It's this way.

16945
09:54:27,200 --> 09:54:28,080
Okay, I'm coming.

16946
09:54:29,860 --> 09:54:31,160
Eating real quick.

16947
09:54:31,700 --> 09:54:32,940
Me too, me too.

16948
09:54:33,060 --> 09:54:34,320
Oh my god, my last bread.

16949
09:54:36,600 --> 09:54:37,980
Alright, here we go.

16950
09:54:38,780 --> 09:54:40,440
Oh my god, it's my last bread.

16951
09:54:41,060 --> 09:54:42,220
Here, here, I'll make more.

16952
09:54:42,460 --> 09:54:42,960
No, it's okay.

16953
09:54:43,140 --> 09:54:44,540
I have lamb.

16954
09:54:44,720 --> 09:54:45,700
We can make some in the morning.

16955
09:54:46,340 --> 09:54:46,660
Alright.

16956
09:54:47,900 --> 09:54:49,280
Where are the phantoms?

16957
09:54:49,480 --> 09:54:49,740
I know.

16958
09:54:51,720 --> 09:54:53,240
I think it's because I killed them.

16959
09:54:53,240 --> 09:54:55,060
They stopped spawning for a bit.

16960
09:54:55,760 --> 09:54:56,180
Oh, maybe.

16961
09:54:57,140 --> 09:54:59,480
We just can't sleep for days and days and days.

16962
09:54:59,560 --> 09:55:01,680
It just makes this playthrough longer.

16963
09:55:02,200 --> 09:55:03,460
Because we can't sleep.

16964
09:55:03,920 --> 09:55:05,640
Just everything goes by longer.

16965
09:55:06,820 --> 09:55:08,460
Oh my god.

16966
09:55:08,780 --> 09:55:10,300
Oh, there's a village!

16967
09:55:11,100 --> 09:55:13,280
We can see there's bookshelves.

16968
09:55:13,540 --> 09:55:14,060
Bookshelves!

16969
09:55:15,000 --> 09:55:15,280
Kill!

16970
09:55:15,520 --> 09:55:16,040
Oh my god.

16971
09:55:16,620 --> 09:55:18,740
I just want to get rid of...

16972
09:55:18,740 --> 09:55:20,080
No, your dog!

16973
09:55:20,080 --> 09:55:21,680
Fine, I have...

16974
09:55:21,680 --> 09:55:22,140
Your dog!

16975
09:55:22,620 --> 09:55:23,100
He's okay.

16976
09:55:23,200 --> 09:55:24,940
I gave him bone and he doesn't want it.

16977
09:55:25,920 --> 09:55:27,240
Yeah, because he's injured.

16978
09:55:28,360 --> 09:55:30,500
No, if you give him bone, you should...

16979
09:55:30,500 --> 09:55:31,940
He can heal himself.

16980
09:55:32,680 --> 09:55:33,780
Oh, feed me?

16981
09:55:35,400 --> 09:55:36,540
Oh my god.

16982
09:55:36,800 --> 09:55:39,760
I interrupted something really personal.

16983
09:55:40,720 --> 09:55:42,840
I want to see this zombie break down the door.

16984
09:55:47,820 --> 09:55:48,580
That's fucked.

16985
09:55:49,840 --> 09:55:50,260
Hello?

16986
09:55:50,260 --> 09:55:50,540
Hello?

16987
09:55:50,920 --> 09:55:51,960
Hello?

16988
09:55:54,100 --> 09:55:55,240
That's messed up.

16989
09:55:55,320 --> 09:55:56,020
Bookshelves!

16990
09:55:57,780 --> 09:55:58,560
Wow!

16991
09:55:58,820 --> 09:55:59,340
Wow!

16992
09:56:00,320 --> 09:56:03,720
He didn't do shit!

16993
09:56:06,040 --> 09:56:06,760
Wow!

16994
09:56:07,280 --> 09:56:10,260
I literally let this guy...

16995
09:56:10,940 --> 09:56:13,720
How do I farm bookshelves?

16996
09:56:14,760 --> 09:56:16,160
Yeah, stupid zombo!

16997
09:56:16,740 --> 09:56:17,280
Up here?

16998
09:56:17,280 --> 09:56:18,800
Didn't do anything.

16999
09:56:18,880 --> 09:56:19,820
There's bookshelves right here.

17000
09:56:20,000 --> 09:56:21,180
Wait, do I need like...

17001
09:56:21,180 --> 09:56:24,140
Okay, so to get bookshelves...

17002
09:56:24,140 --> 09:56:27,900
We need silk touch to make it so that they break as bookshelves.

17003
09:56:27,980 --> 09:56:29,380
Otherwise, they break as books.

17004
09:56:30,840 --> 09:56:31,300
Okay.

17005
09:56:31,600 --> 09:56:33,540
And then we need...

17006
09:56:33,540 --> 09:56:35,240
That doesn't give us as many books.

17007
09:56:36,200 --> 09:56:36,660
Okay.

17008
09:56:38,400 --> 09:56:38,860
Yeah.

17009
09:56:40,240 --> 09:56:42,100
So in the end...

17010
09:56:42,100 --> 09:56:44,080
In the end, we just have to get the books.

17011
09:56:45,360 --> 09:56:46,900
Alright, let's just farm the books.

17012
09:56:47,000 --> 09:56:47,800
Just farm the books.

17013
09:56:47,860 --> 09:56:48,880
Farm the books.

17014
09:56:49,080 --> 09:56:49,560
Farm the books.

17015
09:56:51,140 --> 09:56:52,020
Oh, my dog.

17016
09:56:52,440 --> 09:56:54,740
Oh, that's the thing we need to read.

17017
09:56:54,820 --> 09:56:56,340
That's what you can do to read the...

17018
09:56:56,340 --> 09:56:57,200
What do you mean you fucked it up?

17019
09:56:58,800 --> 09:56:59,400
It's fine.

17020
09:57:00,820 --> 09:57:02,020
I got the books.

17021
09:57:02,100 --> 09:57:02,780
I got books.

17022
09:57:04,120 --> 09:57:07,520
Oh, I got the books.

17023
09:57:07,820 --> 09:57:08,880
We got the books.

17024
09:57:10,880 --> 09:57:12,100
We got the books.

17025
09:57:12,100 --> 09:57:13,180
We got the books.

17026
09:57:13,380 --> 09:57:16,040
We need a lot of books.

17027
09:57:16,200 --> 09:57:17,840
We need a whole ton of books.

17028
09:57:18,240 --> 09:57:19,960
We need even more books.

17029
09:57:21,400 --> 09:57:23,160
A ton of books.

17030
09:57:23,560 --> 09:57:25,200
Hey, let's go!

17031
09:57:26,720 --> 09:57:29,560
There's a lot of bread in this one, but I have no room.

17032
09:57:31,120 --> 09:57:32,400
You can eat the food anyway.

17033
09:57:34,140 --> 09:57:35,460
Oh, lots of potatoes.

17034
09:57:35,860 --> 09:57:36,500
Lots of apples.

17035
09:57:38,480 --> 09:57:39,440
Are there any more books?

17036
09:57:39,440 --> 09:57:40,680
Is there any more books?

17037
09:57:41,040 --> 09:57:42,480
Any more books for us?

17038
09:57:45,060 --> 09:57:47,320
We're gonna grab the books.

17039
09:57:47,660 --> 09:57:49,240
We're gonna rob you.

17040
09:57:49,540 --> 09:57:50,940
We need it more than you.

17041
09:57:51,140 --> 09:57:53,000
What you gonna do with all these books?

17042
09:57:53,200 --> 09:57:56,160
I don't appreciate your attitude, Super Chatter.

17043
09:57:56,320 --> 09:57:57,560
I don't appreciate your attitude.

17044
09:57:58,060 --> 09:57:59,940
There's a potion thing right here.

17045
09:58:00,020 --> 09:58:01,120
Do we need it?

17046
09:58:01,900 --> 09:58:03,360
Yeah, just grab it.

17047
09:58:03,420 --> 09:58:04,260
If you have room.

17048
09:58:04,800 --> 09:58:06,840
If you don't have room, then whatever.

17049
09:58:06,840 --> 09:58:08,400
I do, I do, I do, I do.

17050
09:58:08,660 --> 09:58:10,220
I'm gonna grab it.

17051
09:58:11,900 --> 09:58:14,100
Get in my...

17052
09:58:14,100 --> 09:58:15,620
Get in my pocket.

17053
09:58:16,060 --> 09:58:17,980
Are you ready to go?

17054
09:58:20,740 --> 09:58:22,200
Oh my god.

17055
09:58:22,560 --> 09:58:27,300
This guy has four zombos and a little baby on a chicken attacking him.

17056
09:58:29,180 --> 09:58:30,660
I'm not dealing with that.

17057
09:58:30,780 --> 09:58:31,600
That's not my job.

17058
09:58:31,940 --> 09:58:34,240
I was gonna lead him to the...

17059
09:58:35,080 --> 09:58:36,080
That's fine.

17060
09:58:36,280 --> 09:58:38,600
To the golem, but...

17061
09:58:38,600 --> 09:58:40,300
You're so obsessive.

17062
09:58:40,480 --> 09:58:40,620
That's fine.

17063
09:58:41,180 --> 09:58:42,920
I need the levels anyway.

17064
09:58:43,160 --> 09:58:44,440
Let's go, let's go!

17065
09:58:45,080 --> 09:58:46,860
Which way?

17066
09:58:47,540 --> 09:58:48,060
This way.

17067
09:58:49,160 --> 09:58:51,100
It's always northeast.

17068
09:58:51,320 --> 09:58:52,620
It's always northeast.

17069
09:58:53,000 --> 09:58:55,060
We never change direction.

17070
09:58:55,480 --> 09:58:56,520
Never change.

17071
09:58:56,600 --> 09:58:59,800
We are one directional girls.

17072
09:59:00,520 --> 09:59:02,040
We got books.

17073
09:59:02,040 --> 09:59:03,160
We got feathers.

17074
09:59:03,480 --> 09:59:05,260
We got everything.

17075
09:59:05,720 --> 09:59:06,500
We got ambition.

17076
09:59:07,240 --> 09:59:09,380
We have strength and determination.

17077
09:59:14,290 --> 09:59:17,670
Oh my god, look at all these pigs.

17078
09:59:19,030 --> 09:59:20,670
We keep moving forward.

17079
09:59:20,870 --> 09:59:23,410
We keep moving forward.

17080
09:59:23,910 --> 09:59:24,850
We're just...

17081
09:59:24,850 --> 09:59:26,690
Look at all these chickens on our way.

17082
09:59:26,950 --> 09:59:28,650
We're killing time.

17083
09:59:29,390 --> 09:59:30,930
Oh my god.

17084
09:59:31,810 --> 09:59:33,270
No, my dog!

17085
09:59:33,690 --> 09:59:34,270
No, he's alive.

17086
09:59:34,570 --> 09:59:36,010
Watch out for the other one.

17087
09:59:36,710 --> 09:59:37,750
Okay, that's fine.

17088
09:59:40,390 --> 09:59:41,250
Where are you?

17089
09:59:41,790 --> 09:59:43,270
I'm right behind you.

17090
09:59:43,390 --> 09:59:44,350
I need to eat though.

17091
09:59:44,710 --> 09:59:45,710
Is my dog okay?

17092
09:59:45,810 --> 09:59:47,470
I need to give him more meat soon.

17093
09:59:49,150 --> 09:59:50,930
Get another dog.

17094
09:59:52,470 --> 09:59:53,290
Get another dog.

17095
09:59:53,590 --> 09:59:54,330
That's fine.

17096
09:59:54,410 --> 09:59:56,230
So if the other one dies, at least I have this one.

17097
09:59:56,790 --> 09:59:57,830
The dog army.

17098
09:59:58,410 --> 09:59:59,230
We got it.

17099
09:59:59,290 --> 10:00:00,830
At this point, this is the only way.

17100
10:00:04,810 --> 10:00:08,410
Oh, it gives all three books that went into the crafting.

17101
10:00:08,530 --> 10:00:09,010
Let's go!

17102
10:00:09,490 --> 10:00:10,090
Okay, good.

17103
10:00:12,390 --> 10:00:13,430
It's just the planks.

17104
10:00:13,550 --> 10:00:14,690
It's just whatever the wood...

17105
10:00:14,690 --> 10:00:15,750
It's fine.

17106
10:00:16,170 --> 10:00:19,710
We're surrounded by trees.

17107
10:00:21,550 --> 10:00:22,250
It's fine.

17108
10:00:22,610 --> 10:00:23,750
We're surrounded by trees.

17109
10:00:23,810 --> 10:00:24,610
We're not in the nether.

17110
10:00:24,610 --> 10:00:26,630
We can get everything we need.

17111
10:00:27,390 --> 10:00:30,590
We're practically winning at this point.

17112
10:00:32,010 --> 10:00:34,190
I wish we had elytras.

17113
10:00:34,490 --> 10:00:36,610
I wish we had elytras.

17114
10:00:37,510 --> 10:00:38,730
I wish we had elytras.

17115
10:00:38,750 --> 10:00:40,510
I wish we could just fly.

17116
10:00:40,790 --> 10:00:42,750
And then all our worries will disappear.

17117
10:00:43,510 --> 10:00:44,850
And then everything...

17118
10:00:44,850 --> 10:00:47,370
Everything we've all worried about...

17119
10:00:47,370 --> 10:00:47,910
Oh, phantom!

17120
10:00:48,230 --> 10:00:48,950
Phantom, phantom!

17121
10:00:49,670 --> 10:00:51,310
Who is it for?

17122
10:00:51,310 --> 10:00:52,290
I think it's me.

17123
10:00:52,670 --> 10:00:53,370
Yeah, it's me.

17124
10:00:53,490 --> 10:00:55,530
It heard you yawning.

17125
10:00:55,990 --> 10:00:57,630
It did hear me yawning, actually.

17126
10:00:58,250 --> 10:01:00,290
I think it's gonna go soon, so we have to kill it quick.

17127
10:01:00,810 --> 10:01:01,610
What took you so long?

17128
10:01:02,730 --> 10:01:03,270
It's good!

17129
10:01:03,670 --> 10:01:03,850
It's good!

17130
10:01:03,910 --> 10:01:04,750
He'll burn.

17131
10:01:06,530 --> 10:01:08,230
Just let him die.

17132
10:01:10,190 --> 10:01:10,590
Burn!

17133
10:01:12,170 --> 10:01:12,570
Burn!

17134
10:01:13,790 --> 10:01:16,390
Give me your membranes!

17135
10:01:16,530 --> 10:01:19,810
Give me your membranes!

17136
10:01:19,810 --> 10:01:21,610
Give me your membranes!

17137
10:01:21,710 --> 10:01:22,910
He didn't give you membranes.

17138
10:01:25,850 --> 10:01:28,070
He didn't give you membranes.

17139
10:01:30,410 --> 10:01:31,290
We tried.

17140
10:01:31,630 --> 10:01:32,910
We tried our best.

17141
10:01:33,550 --> 10:01:34,590
7,000!

17142
10:01:35,050 --> 10:01:36,830
Oh my god, 7,000!

17143
10:01:36,990 --> 10:01:37,950
Look at us go!

17144
10:01:40,970 --> 10:01:42,450
We have to kill it ourselves.

17145
10:01:43,250 --> 10:01:44,210
Now we know.

17146
10:01:44,510 --> 10:01:45,470
Now we know.

17147
10:01:45,470 --> 10:01:46,270
Now we know.

17148
10:01:46,850 --> 10:01:47,730
Now we know.

17149
10:01:48,250 --> 10:01:49,430
Look at that.

17150
10:01:51,290 --> 10:01:53,150
We're so close.

17151
10:01:53,950 --> 10:01:55,230
We're so close.

17152
10:01:55,590 --> 10:01:56,630
We are so close.

17153
10:01:56,630 --> 10:01:58,330
We're not even.

17154
10:01:58,750 --> 10:01:59,290
We are.

17155
10:02:00,550 --> 10:02:03,330
We literally need to get our lapis.

17156
10:02:03,510 --> 10:02:04,610
And then it's like...

17157
10:02:04,610 --> 10:02:05,850
We just speedrun to the end.

17158
10:02:06,290 --> 10:02:07,150
And then we're there.

17159
10:02:07,710 --> 10:02:11,050
The moment we get to the area...

17160
10:02:11,050 --> 10:02:12,430
We have to kill the dragon.

17161
10:02:12,430 --> 10:02:14,590
We have nothing to kill him with.

17162
10:02:14,690 --> 10:02:15,650
What do you mean?

17163
10:02:15,750 --> 10:02:17,870
We have so many things.

17164
10:02:17,910 --> 10:02:20,090
We need the phantom membranes.

17165
10:02:20,330 --> 10:02:23,370
We will get the phantom membranes as we travel.

17166
10:02:24,050 --> 10:02:25,970
That's what traveling is for.

17167
10:02:26,270 --> 10:02:28,530
We only have one phantom at a time.

17168
10:02:28,650 --> 10:02:29,890
And he dropped nothing.

17169
10:02:31,830 --> 10:02:33,470
How many phantom membranes do we need?

17170
10:02:33,650 --> 10:02:36,590
We need a lot of slow falling.

17171
10:02:37,290 --> 10:02:39,150
How many do we need?

17172
10:02:39,170 --> 10:02:40,070
I don't know.

17173
10:02:40,070 --> 10:02:41,530
I don't know.

17174
10:02:42,230 --> 10:02:42,830
Actually...

17175
10:02:42,830 --> 10:02:43,910
Do we have redstone?

17176
10:02:46,670 --> 10:02:48,230
We might need to grab...

17177
10:02:48,230 --> 10:02:50,450
It will make the potions last longer.

17178
10:02:50,450 --> 10:02:51,690
Oh my god.

17179
10:02:52,530 --> 10:02:53,570
Oh my god.

17180
10:02:54,610 --> 10:02:56,490
We have to go back to...

17181
10:02:59,710 --> 10:03:02,830
You literally told me...

17182
10:03:02,830 --> 10:03:06,450
We threw away all our redstone because somebody...

17183
10:03:07,190 --> 10:03:07,870
Somebody...

17184
10:03:07,870 --> 10:03:09,050
We only need a little bit.

17185
10:03:09,130 --> 10:03:09,730
We don't need a lot.

17186
10:03:11,210 --> 10:03:13,330
Somebody was saying...

17187
10:03:14,250 --> 10:03:16,370
All I was thinking of was...

17188
10:03:16,370 --> 10:03:18,570
All I was thinking of was...

17189
10:03:18,570 --> 10:03:20,390
Back to the mines we go, I guess.

17190
10:03:20,530 --> 10:03:22,010
Back to the mines we go.

17191
10:03:23,530 --> 10:03:25,210
Why don't you go back to the mines?

17192
10:03:25,310 --> 10:03:27,130
You want me to do it?

17193
10:03:27,190 --> 10:03:30,250
You want me to go back into the mines?

17194
10:03:30,270 --> 10:03:31,790
We'll do it together.

17195
10:03:31,910 --> 10:03:32,450
We'll do it together.

17196
10:03:32,770 --> 10:03:35,110
We'll work together.

17197
10:03:35,430 --> 10:03:38,010
To grab the redstone.

17198
10:03:41,910 --> 10:03:43,190
What does that mean?

17199
10:03:44,310 --> 10:03:45,130
Someone just said...

17200
10:03:45,130 --> 10:03:48,350
If you guys are on a paper server, will things spawn more slowly?

17201
10:03:49,870 --> 10:03:50,390
Oh...

17202
10:03:50,390 --> 10:03:51,610
Wait, what things spawn...

17203
10:03:51,610 --> 10:03:53,630
Why did you choose a paper server?

17204
10:03:54,150 --> 10:03:56,050
I don't know what server we needed!

17205
10:03:59,050 --> 10:04:00,270
Does it really matter?

17206
10:04:00,510 --> 10:04:02,910
Does it really matter that things spawn slowly?

17207
10:04:03,330 --> 10:04:04,630
It's just the phantoms.

17208
10:04:04,730 --> 10:04:06,210
It literally is just the phantoms.

17209
10:04:06,370 --> 10:04:09,450
But we need a lot of slow falling potions.

17210
10:04:13,890 --> 10:04:15,170
Oh my god.

17211
10:04:15,830 --> 10:04:16,930
Can you change it?

17212
10:04:17,230 --> 10:04:18,730
Can you change it?

17213
10:04:18,830 --> 10:04:19,750
I can change it.

17214
10:04:19,750 --> 10:04:21,270
I think I can swap it, but I don't know.

17215
10:04:21,470 --> 10:04:23,370
Wait, the Z is going up.

17216
10:04:23,470 --> 10:04:23,850
Oh no.

17217
10:04:24,350 --> 10:04:25,650
We gotta go up the mountain.

17218
10:04:27,590 --> 10:04:29,150
We gotta go up the mountain.

17219
10:04:32,970 --> 10:04:34,130
I'm just gonna...

17220
10:04:34,130 --> 10:04:36,190
I'm trying to place my blocks here.

17221
10:04:37,230 --> 10:04:38,650
Did you know about the paper thing?

17222
10:04:38,750 --> 10:04:39,770
Did you know about it?

17223
10:04:39,770 --> 10:04:40,270
No.

17224
10:04:41,070 --> 10:04:42,790
Exactly, so even if...

17225
10:04:42,790 --> 10:04:46,210
Why are people telling us this at like...

17226
10:04:46,210 --> 10:04:47,630
10 hours into the game?

17227
10:04:48,090 --> 10:04:49,770
Even if you made that server...

17228
10:04:50,550 --> 10:04:51,630
They should have been like...

17229
10:04:51,630 --> 10:04:52,710
Oh yeah, by the way...

17230
10:04:54,290 --> 10:04:56,510
When we first started the game...

17231
10:04:56,510 --> 10:04:57,050
They should have been like...

17232
10:04:57,050 --> 10:04:59,730
Hey, by the way, things are gonna spawn a little more slowly...

17233
10:04:59,730 --> 10:05:00,870
Because you choose this.

17234
10:05:01,230 --> 10:05:02,910
Okay, we'll just redo it.

17235
10:05:03,050 --> 10:05:04,590
Since we're not very far in.

17236
10:05:04,810 --> 10:05:07,150
But now that we're 10 hours into the stream!

17237
10:05:08,350 --> 10:05:10,130
It's okay, everything will be fine.

17238
10:05:10,190 --> 10:05:11,170
We just keep going northeast.

17239
10:05:11,550 --> 10:05:15,510
We have not encountered anything bad yet.

17240
10:05:15,650 --> 10:05:16,790
Nothing bad has happened.

17241
10:05:16,910 --> 10:05:18,190
We just keep going northeast.

17242
10:05:19,770 --> 10:05:21,750
Nothing bad has happened so far.

17243
10:05:22,290 --> 10:05:23,430
Stop saying that.

17244
10:05:23,570 --> 10:05:24,310
You're scaring me.

17245
10:05:25,410 --> 10:05:26,870
Stop it, stop saying it.

17246
10:05:27,630 --> 10:05:28,350
There's another dog.

17247
10:05:28,450 --> 10:05:29,130
You want another pet?

17248
10:05:29,930 --> 10:05:30,390
Where is he?

17249
10:05:30,610 --> 10:05:31,590
Oh, I'm at the top of the mountain.

17250
10:05:31,710 --> 10:05:32,010
Where are you?

17251
10:05:32,210 --> 10:05:33,110
Okay, I don't need him.

17252
10:05:33,130 --> 10:05:33,670
We'll find more.

17253
10:05:33,670 --> 10:05:35,350
We have 10,000 more blocks to go.

17254
10:05:35,510 --> 10:05:37,730
I'm pretty sure we'll find another dog by then.

17255
10:05:37,770 --> 10:05:39,210
I'm pretty sure.

17256
10:05:39,590 --> 10:05:40,750
I'm pretty sure.

17257
10:05:40,950 --> 10:05:42,310
I wish I had some bones.

17258
10:05:44,230 --> 10:05:45,250
I told you.

17259
10:05:45,390 --> 10:05:48,130
I told you about keeping the bones.

17260
10:05:48,290 --> 10:05:50,410
You were like, Doki, get rid of the bones.

17261
10:05:50,530 --> 10:05:51,550
I was like, no, no, no.

17262
10:05:51,690 --> 10:05:53,410
It's gonna be useful, I swear to God.

17263
10:05:53,550 --> 10:05:54,930
We're gonna need it.

17264
10:05:56,170 --> 10:05:57,090
And I was right.

17265
10:05:57,810 --> 10:05:58,490
Are you done?

17266
10:05:59,630 --> 10:05:59,990
No.

17267
10:05:59,990 --> 10:06:00,050
No.

17268
10:06:01,710 --> 10:06:03,810
Are you even following me?

17269
10:06:03,910 --> 10:06:05,570
I don't think you're following me anymore.

17270
10:06:06,270 --> 10:06:07,490
I'm like in my own world.

17271
10:06:07,810 --> 10:06:09,670
I don't think you're even following me anymore.

17272
10:06:09,810 --> 10:06:11,650
I think we've lost each other.

17273
10:06:11,750 --> 10:06:12,750
I think we've lost each other.

17274
10:06:14,830 --> 10:06:16,350
We're going the same way, right?

17275
10:06:16,470 --> 10:06:17,430
We're going the same way.

17276
10:06:17,450 --> 10:06:19,010
I'm in the snowy area.

17277
10:06:20,710 --> 10:06:22,990
I have not seen a single snow area.

17278
10:06:23,390 --> 10:06:23,990
I have...

17279
10:06:26,230 --> 10:06:28,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

17280
10:06:28,630 --> 10:06:29,570
There has been...

17281
10:06:29,570 --> 10:06:31,530
I'm going up a little on the Z.

17282
10:06:32,050 --> 10:06:33,050
I'm in the snow.

17283
10:06:34,290 --> 10:06:35,970
I'm scared of the powdered snow.

17284
10:06:36,990 --> 10:06:39,790
There has not been snow at all.

17285
10:06:41,270 --> 10:06:42,590
Mine is going down.

17286
10:06:42,910 --> 10:06:43,810
Mine is going down.

17287
10:06:43,910 --> 10:06:45,610
I'm going correctly northeast.

17288
10:06:50,880 --> 10:06:52,860
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17289
10:06:53,140 --> 10:06:53,560
I...

17290
10:06:54,780 --> 10:06:56,840
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17291
10:06:58,280 --> 10:06:59,260
I'm going.

17292
10:07:00,660 --> 10:07:01,940
I don't know.

17293
10:07:02,280 --> 10:07:03,080
There's a village.

17294
10:07:03,240 --> 10:07:03,940
I'm at a village.

17295
10:07:04,640 --> 10:07:06,020
I am at a village.

17296
10:07:06,740 --> 10:07:08,080
I am at a regular village.

17297
10:07:08,440 --> 10:07:09,160
I am here.

17298
10:07:10,600 --> 10:07:12,560
One of us went the wrong way.

17299
10:07:12,720 --> 10:07:14,320
No, mine is going down.

17300
10:07:15,180 --> 10:07:16,380
One of us is...

17301
10:07:16,380 --> 10:07:17,560
You missed the village.

17302
10:07:17,760 --> 10:07:20,100
You can hang out at the village.

17303
10:07:20,400 --> 10:07:21,100
You can have fun there.

17304
10:07:21,480 --> 10:07:22,980
Somebody here is trying to get books now.

17305
10:07:24,520 --> 10:07:26,160
I'm trying to get to our home.

17306
10:07:27,900 --> 10:07:28,420
Our home.

17307
10:07:28,420 --> 10:07:29,500
I like how you call it our home.

17308
10:07:30,580 --> 10:07:33,200
We have no home.

17309
10:07:33,380 --> 10:07:34,340
We have no home.

17310
10:07:34,660 --> 10:07:36,220
We have no home.

17311
10:07:36,220 --> 10:07:36,940
We have no home.

17312
10:07:37,920 --> 10:07:39,760
I just want to drop down.

17313
10:07:40,320 --> 10:07:41,460
Okay, now I found the snow.

17314
10:07:42,160 --> 10:07:43,800
You're way behind me.

17315
10:07:44,160 --> 10:07:44,940
No, no, no.

17316
10:07:45,040 --> 10:07:47,540
I know exactly you're in the mountain behind me.

17317
10:07:47,840 --> 10:07:47,980
What?

17318
10:07:49,320 --> 10:07:51,500
There's also more snow here.

17319
10:07:51,580 --> 10:07:53,480
I see a giant mountain filled with snow.

17320
10:07:53,480 --> 10:07:55,760
I passed the mountain.

17321
10:07:57,140 --> 10:07:58,920
Wait, there's several mountains.

17322
10:07:59,520 --> 10:08:01,540
Wait, there's several mountains.

17323
10:08:02,400 --> 10:08:04,140
Wait a minute.

17324
10:08:04,420 --> 10:08:05,480
What is your coordinate?

17325
10:08:06,780 --> 10:08:08,120
Negative ten thousand.

17326
10:08:09,900 --> 10:08:11,780
Where are you?

17327
10:08:11,960 --> 10:08:14,100
Negative nine thousand five hundred.

17328
10:08:17,260 --> 10:08:19,200
You're behind me.

17329
10:08:19,540 --> 10:08:22,300
You're behind me in that past mountain.

17330
10:08:22,300 --> 10:08:23,700
That's where you are.

17331
10:08:25,380 --> 10:08:27,040
Do you want me to wait for you?

17332
10:08:27,620 --> 10:08:28,620
No, just keep going.

17333
10:08:30,900 --> 10:08:33,480
We're both going the same path.

17334
10:08:33,800 --> 10:08:34,380
We're going the same path.

17335
10:08:34,920 --> 10:08:37,360
We're going the same path anyways.

17336
10:08:37,540 --> 10:08:38,680
It doesn't really matter.

17337
10:08:39,380 --> 10:08:40,700
We're just gonna meet up.

17338
10:08:40,840 --> 10:08:42,720
There's a little arctic fox.

17339
10:08:43,100 --> 10:08:43,720
So cute.

17340
10:08:48,320 --> 10:08:51,200
Wait a minute.

17341
10:08:51,880 --> 10:08:54,020
I'm at negative nine thousand now.

17342
10:08:54,160 --> 10:08:58,180
Oh my god.

17343
10:08:59,460 --> 10:09:01,780
By the time we get there, we'll have all our materials.

17344
10:09:02,060 --> 10:09:03,480
We'll have everything we ever wanted.

17345
10:09:03,500 --> 10:09:03,820
I don't think I'm strong enough.

17346
10:09:03,940 --> 10:09:07,100
This is why those other streamers have...

17347
10:09:07,540 --> 10:09:09,860
This is why those other streamers have so many subscribers.

17348
10:09:10,440 --> 10:09:11,340
I'm not strong enough.

17349
10:09:11,340 --> 10:09:13,780
Min, we'll have...

17350
10:09:13,780 --> 10:09:15,720
Just think about how good it's gonna feel.

17351
10:09:16,020 --> 10:09:16,420
Min, we'll just...

17352
10:09:16,420 --> 10:09:17,540
What if we die?

17353
10:09:19,040 --> 10:09:20,480
Don't say that, Min.

17354
10:09:20,580 --> 10:09:22,920
What if we die to the dragon?

17355
10:09:23,720 --> 10:09:25,340
Don't say that.

17356
10:09:26,200 --> 10:09:27,340
What if we die...

17357
10:09:28,160 --> 10:09:29,340
to the dragon?

17358
10:09:30,940 --> 10:09:33,740
It's so sad that we lost.

17359
10:09:34,660 --> 10:09:35,020
It's so sad that we lost.

17360
10:09:35,020 --> 10:09:35,380
We lost.

17361
10:09:39,660 --> 10:09:41,220
I wanna go to sleep.

17362
10:09:42,080 --> 10:09:43,560
Min, we have...

17363
10:09:43,560 --> 10:09:45,420
We already invested so much time.

17364
10:09:45,420 --> 10:09:48,900
What if we wake up and then we play more tomorrow?

17365
10:09:49,200 --> 10:09:50,620
We wake up in the morning.

17366
10:09:51,180 --> 10:09:52,340
Min, you know...

17367
10:09:53,900 --> 10:09:56,460
We're gonna be sleeping for a very long time.

17368
10:09:56,580 --> 10:09:57,320
You know that.

17369
10:09:57,480 --> 10:09:59,260
I can't sleep for a long time.

17370
10:09:59,340 --> 10:10:00,720
I have a flight to catch.

17371
10:10:02,100 --> 10:10:05,220
Then it'll make the sleeping so much more worth it.

17372
10:10:05,600 --> 10:10:08,840
When we beat the ender dragon.

17373
10:10:09,260 --> 10:10:11,900
It'll make it so much more worth it.

17374
10:10:11,900 --> 10:10:14,540
Min, just think about how good it's gonna feel.

17375
10:10:14,980 --> 10:10:16,320
I'm gonna need this.

17376
10:10:17,860 --> 10:10:20,660
I'm gonna need this just in case I fall into snow.

17377
10:10:21,300 --> 10:10:21,880
Powdered snow.

17378
10:10:22,040 --> 10:10:23,140
Watch out for powdered snow.

17379
10:10:23,280 --> 10:10:24,400
Make sure you have an empty bucket.

17380
10:10:26,240 --> 10:10:27,420
Okay, nevermind then.

17381
10:10:27,860 --> 10:10:30,400
You can fall in for a...

17382
10:10:30,400 --> 10:10:32,380
You can get a whole face full of snow.

17383
10:10:35,580 --> 10:10:36,220
I'm in.

17384
10:10:37,540 --> 10:10:39,060
This is how I might die.

17385
10:10:39,060 --> 10:10:40,440
What are you talking about?

17386
10:10:40,740 --> 10:10:42,980
The powdered snow, this might be it.

17387
10:10:43,560 --> 10:10:44,380
Wait, you don't have a bucket?

17388
10:10:45,520 --> 10:10:47,040
No, I don't.

17389
10:10:47,140 --> 10:10:48,820
I gave you all my iron.

17390
10:10:55,640 --> 10:10:59,100
Okay, I'll wait for you.

17391
10:10:59,200 --> 10:10:59,600
I'll wait for you.

17392
10:11:01,000 --> 10:11:02,460
I'm not close.

17393
10:11:02,860 --> 10:11:03,400
What are you at?

17394
10:11:03,400 --> 10:11:04,320
What are you at?

17395
10:11:04,780 --> 10:11:06,340
I can't help it.

17396
10:11:06,780 --> 10:11:07,340
What are you at?

17397
10:11:07,820 --> 10:11:09,980
I'm so cold.

17398
10:11:10,560 --> 10:11:11,740
Where are you at?

17399
10:11:11,940 --> 10:11:12,860
Tell me you're cold.

17400
10:11:13,340 --> 10:11:18,460
I'm at negative 9,706,639.

17401
10:11:20,000 --> 10:11:22,100
Oh, you're like further on the Z than me.

17402
10:11:22,860 --> 10:11:24,060
Yeah, I went to the Z.

17403
10:11:24,160 --> 10:11:25,420
I focused on the Z.

17404
10:11:28,680 --> 10:11:30,080
I'm focusing on the Z.

17405
10:11:30,080 --> 10:11:30,120
I'm focusing on the Z.

17406
10:11:32,140 --> 10:11:33,760
I might actually be able to find you.

17407
10:11:33,920 --> 10:11:34,600
Are you on the ice?

17408
10:11:36,040 --> 10:11:37,620
I'm in the ice area.

17409
10:11:39,080 --> 10:11:40,120
Just farming.

17410
10:11:40,980 --> 10:11:41,600
You're farming?

17411
10:11:41,940 --> 10:11:42,580
What are you farming?

17412
10:11:43,160 --> 10:11:46,080
I'm getting up on the...

17413
10:11:47,440 --> 10:11:48,800
I'm getting up on the trees.

17414
10:11:50,040 --> 10:11:50,460
Why?

17415
10:11:51,240 --> 10:11:53,280
So I can not die from snow.

17416
10:11:53,440 --> 10:11:54,340
What do you mean why?

17417
10:11:54,900 --> 10:11:56,100
No, you're fine.

17418
10:11:56,260 --> 10:11:57,700
It's not all snow.

17419
10:11:58,640 --> 10:11:59,160
There's a lot of snow.

17420
10:11:59,160 --> 10:12:01,080
I'm making a peepee tower.

17421
10:12:01,240 --> 10:12:02,400
There's a lot of snow.

17422
10:12:03,160 --> 10:12:04,500
I'm making a peepee tower.

17423
10:12:05,200 --> 10:12:06,740
I'm just going through the snow.

17424
10:12:06,880 --> 10:12:08,980
I'm traveling through the snow right now.

17425
10:12:09,220 --> 10:12:10,880
I'm protecting myself for the night.

17426
10:12:12,400 --> 10:12:13,980
In case a phantom comes through.

17427
10:12:16,240 --> 10:12:17,840
I'm just making a bridge.

17428
10:12:18,000 --> 10:12:19,600
I'm just gonna make a bridge.

17429
10:12:20,060 --> 10:12:22,200
I'm just gonna make a bridge.

17430
10:12:22,460 --> 10:12:23,760
I'm gonna make a bridge.

17431
10:12:23,820 --> 10:12:25,940
If a phantom hits me, then GG's.

17432
10:12:25,940 --> 10:12:27,580
Where are you?

17433
10:12:27,840 --> 10:12:29,880
Come to 9152.

17434
10:12:32,440 --> 10:12:32,620
What?

17435
10:12:32,980 --> 10:12:33,940
I'm just gonna make a bridge.

17436
10:12:34,020 --> 10:12:36,380
I'm just gonna make the bridge.

17437
10:12:36,720 --> 10:12:38,660
I'm just gonna make the bridge and head straight.

17438
10:12:38,800 --> 10:12:41,140
I'm just gonna head straight.

17439
10:12:41,360 --> 10:12:42,080
Wait, what's your Z?

17440
10:12:45,220 --> 10:12:45,620
6653.

17441
10:12:45,740 --> 10:12:46,460
Okay, I'm close.

17442
10:12:46,980 --> 10:12:49,140
You're gonna see me.

17443
10:12:49,240 --> 10:12:49,840
I'm a bridge.

17444
10:12:49,940 --> 10:12:51,240
I'm basically a bridge.

17445
10:12:51,420 --> 10:12:52,740
I'm basically a bridge.

17446
10:12:52,820 --> 10:12:53,640
You're gonna see me.

17447
10:12:53,640 --> 10:12:54,280
I'm up here.

17448
10:12:54,820 --> 10:12:56,000
Do you see me?

17449
10:12:56,360 --> 10:12:57,220
I don't know.

17450
10:12:57,360 --> 10:12:58,260
I'm making bridges.

17451
10:12:58,420 --> 10:12:59,920
I'm not looking at anything else.

17452
10:13:00,200 --> 10:13:00,340
Sky bridge.

17453
10:13:00,540 --> 10:13:01,900
It's the real strat.

17454
10:13:02,520 --> 10:13:05,000
I'm making a sky bridge right now.

17455
10:13:05,140 --> 10:13:06,880
Yeah, sky bridge lives.

17456
10:13:10,420 --> 10:13:11,920
It lives on.

17457
10:13:13,680 --> 10:13:14,800
Sky bridge.

17458
10:13:17,280 --> 10:13:18,400
I'm at...

17459
10:13:20,240 --> 10:13:20,800
9630.

17460
10:13:20,800 --> 10:13:22,880
Okay, I'm 500 blocks.

17461
10:13:25,200 --> 10:13:26,640
Just look up in the sky.

17462
10:13:26,800 --> 10:13:28,100
You'll see the speed bridge.

17463
10:13:28,820 --> 10:13:31,000
I don't know if it's a speed bridge.

17464
10:13:31,360 --> 10:13:32,820
I think that is a little bit...

17465
10:13:34,280 --> 10:13:36,720
Just look up and you'll find the bridge.

17466
10:13:38,580 --> 10:13:40,160
Oh my gosh, I just got peach over.

17467
10:13:41,480 --> 10:13:42,580
If I fall, it's over.

17468
10:13:42,680 --> 10:13:43,660
I just need you to know that.

17469
10:13:43,740 --> 10:13:45,100
If I fall, it's over.

17470
10:13:45,420 --> 10:13:46,680
How tall did you go?

17471
10:13:47,420 --> 10:13:49,420
I went up the tree and...

17472
10:13:51,740 --> 10:13:53,400
It's so over.

17473
10:13:53,880 --> 10:13:54,640
Wait, what happened?

17474
10:13:54,820 --> 10:13:55,280
Did you die?

17475
10:13:55,780 --> 10:13:58,140
If I fall, it's over.

17476
10:13:58,420 --> 10:14:01,180
If I get hit by the phantom, it's over.

17477
10:14:01,920 --> 10:14:02,260
Oh my god.

17478
10:14:03,060 --> 10:14:05,040
Oh my god, don't do it.

17479
10:14:05,100 --> 10:14:05,720
Don't do it.

17480
10:14:06,040 --> 10:14:06,980
Go back down.

17481
10:14:07,340 --> 10:14:09,200
The sky bridge is dangerous.

17482
10:14:10,000 --> 10:14:10,680
It's too late.

17483
10:14:10,780 --> 10:14:12,520
My dogs are blocking me.

17484
10:14:12,580 --> 10:14:14,640
I have to push my dogs down.

17485
10:14:14,640 --> 10:14:17,040
If I want to live.

17486
10:14:18,800 --> 10:14:20,800
The phantoms are gonna knock you off.

17487
10:14:21,340 --> 10:14:23,060
The phantoms are gonna come.

17488
10:14:23,560 --> 10:14:24,480
The phantoms.

17489
10:14:25,280 --> 10:14:26,280
I have a boat.

17490
10:14:26,480 --> 10:14:27,500
I have a boat.

17491
10:14:27,580 --> 10:14:28,900
Use your boat.

17492
10:14:29,700 --> 10:14:32,200
Use your boat.

17493
10:14:33,880 --> 10:14:36,020
I built a little platform.

17494
10:14:36,360 --> 10:14:38,020
If I fall, I might...

17495
10:14:38,020 --> 10:14:40,620
I'll take some damage.

17496
10:14:40,860 --> 10:14:41,680
But I think I'll be okay.

17497
10:14:41,680 --> 10:14:42,540
Goodbye boat.

17498
10:14:42,820 --> 10:14:43,380
Goodbye.

17499
10:14:44,340 --> 10:14:45,740
What do you mean goodbye boat?

17500
10:14:46,040 --> 10:14:48,020
I can make another boat.

17501
10:14:49,320 --> 10:14:50,160
It's fine.

17502
10:14:52,840 --> 10:14:54,220
Oh my god.

17503
10:14:54,500 --> 10:14:55,760
I have a skelly shooting at me.

17504
10:14:58,360 --> 10:14:59,660
How did he see me?

17505
10:15:00,220 --> 10:15:00,660
Freak.

17506
10:15:00,680 --> 10:15:02,320
I'm gonna make another boat right now.

17507
10:15:02,480 --> 10:15:03,200
Just in case.

17508
10:15:05,780 --> 10:15:07,020
Just in case.

17509
10:15:07,340 --> 10:15:07,900
Freak.

17510
10:15:07,900 --> 10:15:10,200
Don't look at my house.

17511
10:15:10,320 --> 10:15:11,140
My sky house.

17512
10:15:12,180 --> 10:15:13,200
What do I have?

17513
10:15:13,280 --> 10:15:14,040
Okay, there you go.

17514
10:15:14,660 --> 10:15:15,800
I'm waiting to see you.

17515
10:15:16,600 --> 10:15:17,660
I don't know, man.

17516
10:15:17,720 --> 10:15:19,640
I'm 9500 right now.

17517
10:15:20,680 --> 10:15:22,180
It's cause you're going so slow.

17518
10:15:22,220 --> 10:15:23,320
Because of your sky bridge.

17519
10:15:24,780 --> 10:15:26,140
Okay, I fucking...

17520
10:15:26,140 --> 10:15:26,900
I'm...

17521
10:15:27,660 --> 10:15:28,820
I have more Zs.

17522
10:15:30,740 --> 10:15:31,800
What's your Zs?

17523
10:15:34,220 --> 10:15:35,500
It is at...

17524
10:15:35,500 --> 10:15:37,100
Oh my god, there's a creeper right here.

17525
10:15:37,600 --> 10:15:41,040
It is at 6680.

17526
10:15:42,020 --> 10:15:45,040
Okay, I'm at 6665.

17527
10:15:45,160 --> 10:15:47,300
So, if you just keep going...

17528
10:15:47,300 --> 10:15:49,400
Towards the positive X...

17529
10:15:49,400 --> 10:15:50,880
And you don't move much of the Z...

17530
10:15:50,880 --> 10:15:52,060
Then we'll run into each other.

17531
10:15:53,540 --> 10:15:53,860
Okay.

17532
10:15:54,920 --> 10:15:55,840
Well, you're gonna see.

17533
10:15:56,620 --> 10:16:00,100
People, if you are trying to endurance this stream with us...

17534
10:16:00,100 --> 10:16:00,880
Do not do that.

17535
10:16:00,960 --> 10:16:03,740
If you need to sleep, if you need to...

17536
10:16:03,740 --> 10:16:05,460
If you have work tomorrow...

17537
10:16:05,460 --> 10:16:06,900
Please go to sleep.

17538
10:16:07,060 --> 10:16:07,460
Please go to sleep.

17539
10:16:09,420 --> 10:16:11,800
You do not have to stay up with us.

17540
10:16:11,920 --> 10:16:12,760
Please do not.

17541
10:16:14,380 --> 10:16:15,520
We're still going.

17542
10:16:15,780 --> 10:16:17,360
We're still here.

17543
10:16:19,880 --> 10:16:20,160
It's fine.

17544
10:16:20,880 --> 10:16:22,640
I am 9300.

17545
10:16:23,660 --> 10:16:24,820
Someone said this was gonna...

17546
10:16:24,820 --> 10:16:26,620
They thought this was gonna be a quick watch.

17547
10:16:27,740 --> 10:16:29,400
You had so much...

17548
10:16:29,400 --> 10:16:29,860
Hope for us.

17549
10:16:29,860 --> 10:16:31,960
Yeah, we thought so too until it took us...

17550
10:16:31,960 --> 10:16:33,500
30 years to find the fortress.

17551
10:16:34,020 --> 10:16:35,000
3 hours...

17552
10:16:35,000 --> 10:16:36,360
4 hours was stuck in the nether.

17553
10:16:36,480 --> 10:16:38,560
I think we had 4 hours of nether time.

17554
10:16:41,920 --> 10:16:43,980
Literally, 4 hours was just...

17555
10:16:44,580 --> 10:16:45,080
In the nether.

17556
10:16:45,260 --> 10:16:47,940
Maybe we should start whispering for people who are going to sleep.

17557
10:16:48,260 --> 10:16:48,540
No.

17558
10:16:49,880 --> 10:16:50,200
Okay.

17559
10:16:50,720 --> 10:16:51,520
Good night, everybody.

17560
10:16:52,600 --> 10:16:54,180
I'm at 9200.

17561
10:16:54,520 --> 10:16:55,120
Where are you?

17562
10:16:56,940 --> 10:16:57,380
9151.

17563
10:16:58,440 --> 10:16:58,880
Okay.

17564
10:17:00,460 --> 10:17:01,720
I should see you soon.

17565
10:17:01,720 --> 10:17:03,980
Unless you're higher in the sky than I imagined.

17566
10:17:04,720 --> 10:17:07,020
6500 is my other...

17567
10:17:07,720 --> 10:17:08,160
6500.

17568
10:17:08,360 --> 10:17:09,760
Oh, I might be a little off.

17569
10:17:10,740 --> 10:17:11,840
Wait, which way do I need to go?

17570
10:17:11,860 --> 10:17:12,780
What's your Z again?

17571
10:17:14,640 --> 10:17:15,080
6665.

17572
10:17:15,880 --> 10:17:16,320
Okay.

17573
10:17:16,600 --> 10:17:17,600
I need to go this way.

17574
10:17:18,300 --> 10:17:19,940
Okay, we'll bump into each other.

17575
10:17:21,360 --> 10:17:22,860
Okay, I'll meet you there.

17576
10:17:24,320 --> 10:17:25,440
I'm on my boat.

17577
10:17:25,440 --> 10:17:26,700
I got off my boat.

17578
10:17:27,640 --> 10:17:28,300
Oh my god.

17579
10:17:28,520 --> 10:17:29,760
I can't move...

17580
10:17:29,760 --> 10:17:31,000
Because skellies are targeting me.

17581
10:17:31,740 --> 10:17:33,640
There has been no skellies on my end.

17582
10:17:34,220 --> 10:17:35,980
I'm not as high as you.

17583
10:17:36,320 --> 10:17:36,960
I think.

17584
10:17:38,000 --> 10:17:39,460
No, I'm just in the ice.

17585
10:17:39,960 --> 10:17:40,200
What?

17586
10:17:41,060 --> 10:17:43,380
Wait, I thought you were...

17587
10:17:43,380 --> 10:17:44,640
I thought you were in the air.

17588
10:17:45,220 --> 10:17:46,380
No, I fucking made a boat.

17589
10:17:46,460 --> 10:17:47,140
I lost my boat.

17590
10:17:47,180 --> 10:17:49,380
My dog got on the boat and I lost the boat!

17591
10:17:50,600 --> 10:17:51,040
What?

17592
10:17:52,580 --> 10:17:53,720
I lost my boat.

17593
10:17:53,720 --> 10:17:55,160
Oh, you're on the ground now.

17594
10:17:55,240 --> 10:17:55,780
What the hell?

17595
10:17:55,820 --> 10:17:56,740
Yeah, I'm on the ground.

17596
10:17:56,880 --> 10:17:57,780
Where are you?

17597
10:17:57,860 --> 10:17:58,660
I'm in the sky.

17598
10:17:58,960 --> 10:18:00,340
I made a peepee tower.

17599
10:18:00,720 --> 10:18:01,820
You made a peepee tower?

17600
10:18:01,820 --> 10:18:02,260
Okay.

17601
10:18:02,460 --> 10:18:04,480
I've been waiting in the peepee tower.

17602
10:18:05,300 --> 10:18:08,780
This is a little awkward because I am definitely not there anymore.

17603
10:18:08,780 --> 10:18:09,700
Wait, come over here.

17604
10:18:10,020 --> 10:18:12,040
I was looking at the sky for you.

17605
10:18:12,400 --> 10:18:14,220
I told you I got in the boat.

17606
10:18:14,340 --> 10:18:15,660
I thought you meant in the boat.

17607
10:18:16,100 --> 10:18:17,620
I meant in the sky.

17608
10:18:17,980 --> 10:18:19,620
No, why would I...

17609
10:18:19,620 --> 10:18:20,260
Why?

17610
10:18:20,260 --> 10:18:21,920
Because if you fall...

17611
10:18:21,920 --> 10:18:25,180
Because if you fall, then you want to take damage in the boat.

17612
10:18:25,940 --> 10:18:27,920
We literally did that all through the nether.

17613
10:18:28,280 --> 10:18:30,560
I used a boat to fall off.

17614
10:18:30,860 --> 10:18:32,760
And then I was in the ground.

17615
10:18:33,120 --> 10:18:35,100
I used a boat to fall off.

17616
10:18:35,300 --> 10:18:36,920
Okay, I'm gonna jump for it then.

17617
10:18:37,000 --> 10:18:38,120
And I'm gonna swim your way.

17618
10:18:38,580 --> 10:18:39,340
Wait, where are you?

17619
10:18:39,500 --> 10:18:44,280
Okay, negative 9,041 is 6,581.

17620
10:18:44,340 --> 10:18:44,680
Oh god.

17621
10:18:45,180 --> 10:18:45,560
Oh shit.

17622
10:18:45,760 --> 10:18:47,740
Oh my god.

17623
10:18:47,740 --> 10:18:49,060
Oh my god, I made it.

17624
10:18:49,220 --> 10:18:49,620
I made it.

17625
10:18:49,780 --> 10:18:53,120
What happened?

17626
10:18:53,360 --> 10:18:55,700
You fell off.

17627
10:18:56,180 --> 10:18:57,380
I thought you were on your boat.

17628
10:18:57,480 --> 10:18:58,040
What happened?

17629
10:18:58,160 --> 10:19:00,300
I don't have a boat!

17630
10:19:04,430 --> 10:19:05,730
I'm gonna keep going.

17631
10:19:05,910 --> 10:19:06,270
No!

17632
10:19:06,550 --> 10:19:07,270
Wait for me!

17633
10:19:07,850 --> 10:19:09,070
I waited for you!

17634
10:19:11,490 --> 10:19:12,730
I don't have a boat.

17635
10:19:12,830 --> 10:19:14,130
I'm slow in the water.

17636
10:19:16,070 --> 10:19:17,410
Don't you have one?

17637
10:19:17,410 --> 10:19:20,230
We had so many wood!

17638
10:19:22,890 --> 10:19:24,630
What happened to the wood?

17639
10:19:25,030 --> 10:19:26,570
What happened to the wood?

17640
10:19:27,970 --> 10:19:29,530
I guess I can make one.

17641
10:19:31,850 --> 10:19:33,630
I'm at negative 9,045.

17642
10:19:33,630 --> 10:19:34,870
Okay, I don't care anymore!

17643
10:19:35,330 --> 10:19:37,810
If you're not waiting for me, I don't care anymore.

17644
10:19:37,850 --> 10:19:38,550
I didn't say...

17645
10:19:38,550 --> 10:19:41,050
Oh my god, I have phantoms.

17646
10:19:41,150 --> 10:19:41,770
I hope you're happy.

17647
10:19:41,850 --> 10:19:43,010
I got the phantoms for you.

17648
10:19:43,630 --> 10:19:44,770
They're looking at me.

17649
10:19:44,770 --> 10:19:47,190
Good thing you didn't get them while you were...

17650
10:19:47,190 --> 10:19:48,090
you know...

17651
10:19:48,090 --> 10:19:50,250
high up in the air, wherever the hell you were.

17652
10:19:50,890 --> 10:19:51,550
What the fuck?

17653
10:19:51,650 --> 10:19:52,770
And there's zombies?!

17654
10:19:56,650 --> 10:19:59,210
Oh my god, I think one of my dogs are gonna die.

17655
10:19:59,250 --> 10:20:00,190
My solo journey.

17656
10:20:01,670 --> 10:20:03,010
Not by choice though.

17657
10:20:05,310 --> 10:20:07,110
I think that's the signal of a...

17658
10:20:07,110 --> 10:20:08,930
of a new day, whenever my...

17659
10:20:08,930 --> 10:20:10,850
shaders do that weird funky...

17660
10:20:12,510 --> 10:20:12,950
thing.

17661
10:20:12,950 --> 10:20:14,510
Oh my god, I'm sorry doggos.

17662
10:20:14,570 --> 10:20:16,010
I don't have meat for you yet.

17663
10:20:21,120 --> 10:20:22,160
Where are they?

17664
10:20:23,200 --> 10:20:24,440
I'm gonna use my bow.

17665
10:20:25,500 --> 10:20:27,260
She's gonna use her bow.

17666
10:20:27,580 --> 10:20:28,120
She's gonna do it.

17667
10:20:29,900 --> 10:20:30,880
I used my bow.

17668
10:20:31,120 --> 10:20:31,660
I couldn't.

17669
10:20:31,800 --> 10:20:32,980
I cannot deal with this anymore.

17670
10:20:33,900 --> 10:20:34,060
No.

17671
10:20:35,880 --> 10:20:37,960
I think this one gives me a membrane.

17672
10:20:38,640 --> 10:20:40,320
I think only one of them gives you a membrane.

17673
10:20:40,320 --> 10:20:40,440
A membrane.

17674
10:20:43,380 --> 10:20:43,980
Oh my god.

17675
10:20:44,380 --> 10:20:44,960
Leave me alone.

17676
10:20:45,080 --> 10:20:45,440
Oh my god.

17677
10:20:45,540 --> 10:20:45,880
Oh my god.

17678
10:20:45,960 --> 10:20:46,520
Oh my god.

17679
10:20:46,620 --> 10:20:47,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17680
10:20:48,000 --> 10:20:50,320
Wait, I have two more?!

17681
10:20:52,520 --> 10:20:53,020
Oh my god.

17682
10:20:53,100 --> 10:20:53,720
Please, please.

17683
10:20:53,820 --> 10:20:54,220
Leave me alone.

17684
10:20:54,340 --> 10:20:55,240
I don't care about your child.

17685
10:20:55,340 --> 10:20:56,280
I don't care about your child.

17686
10:20:56,860 --> 10:20:57,760
Please, I don't care

17687
10:21:02,010 --> 10:21:02,510
about...

17688
10:21:04,810 --> 10:21:05,370
Please, no!

17689
10:21:06,990 --> 10:21:07,550
What happened?

17690
10:21:08,890 --> 10:21:10,010
It burned to death.

17691
10:21:11,750 --> 10:21:12,310
Bad luck.

17692
10:21:12,310 --> 10:21:12,750
Oh my god.

17693
10:21:12,810 --> 10:21:13,250
No, baby.

17694
10:21:13,350 --> 10:21:13,650
No, baby.

17695
10:21:13,730 --> 10:21:14,030
No, baby.

17696
10:21:14,130 --> 10:21:14,430
No, baby.

17697
10:21:14,550 --> 10:21:14,810
No, baby.

17698
10:21:14,890 --> 10:21:15,230
No, baby.

17699
10:21:15,690 --> 10:21:16,270
No, baby.

17700
10:21:16,430 --> 10:21:16,650
No, baby.

17701
10:21:16,750 --> 10:21:17,010
No, baby.

17702
10:21:17,030 --> 10:21:18,490
It burned to death.

17703
10:21:19,670 --> 10:21:22,030
Okay, I'm okay.

17704
10:21:27,750 --> 10:21:28,950
It burned to death.

17705
10:21:29,350 --> 10:21:30,810
It burned to death.

17706
10:21:31,370 --> 10:21:32,010
It's fine.

17707
10:21:32,350 --> 10:21:32,990
It's fine.

17708
10:21:33,070 --> 10:21:35,310
Why do all of these polar bears have babies?

17709
10:21:36,030 --> 10:21:36,390
It's fine.

17710
10:21:37,190 --> 10:21:38,010
I don't know.

17711
10:21:38,150 --> 10:21:38,670
I don't know.

17712
10:21:39,970 --> 10:21:41,290
4, 6, 8.

17713
10:21:41,350 --> 10:21:41,950
Okay, 8.

17714
10:21:42,390 --> 10:21:42,790
2.

17715
10:21:42,990 --> 10:21:43,330
Okay.

17716
10:21:43,330 --> 10:21:44,550
I have enough for a furnace.

17717
10:21:45,050 --> 10:21:45,950
I'm gonna make a furnace.

17718
10:21:46,150 --> 10:21:47,090
I'm waiting for you.

17719
10:21:47,130 --> 10:21:48,390
I'm waiting for you right here.

17720
10:21:48,470 --> 10:21:48,990
Where are you at?

17721
10:21:49,710 --> 10:21:51,610
I'm making a furnace right now.

17722
10:21:51,610 --> 10:21:53,450
That doesn't explain where you're at.

17723
10:21:53,630 --> 10:21:54,190
I had a second.

17724
10:21:54,350 --> 10:21:55,590
I told you my thing.

17725
10:21:55,930 --> 10:21:56,450
Don't worry.

17726
10:21:56,530 --> 10:21:57,690
Let me put stuff in here.

17727
10:21:57,790 --> 10:21:57,830
Oh my god.

17728
10:21:57,830 --> 10:21:57,950
Oh my god.

17729
10:21:58,010 --> 10:21:58,610
Please drown.

17730
10:21:58,770 --> 10:21:59,690
Please, please, please, please.

17731
10:22:00,090 --> 10:22:00,550
Leave me alone.

17732
10:22:00,630 --> 10:22:01,430
Please leave me alone.

17733
10:22:01,510 --> 10:22:02,010
Please leave me alone.

17734
10:22:02,150 --> 10:22:03,550
Do dogs eat chicken?

17735
10:22:03,870 --> 10:22:04,650
Do they eat chicken?

17736
10:22:04,850 --> 10:22:05,330
I don't know.

17737
10:22:06,050 --> 10:22:06,950
Dogs eat anything.

17738
10:22:07,090 --> 10:22:07,690
Give them peanut butter.

17739
10:22:07,870 --> 10:22:08,310
I'm not talking to you.

17740
10:22:08,530 --> 10:22:09,170
I'm not talking to you.

17741
10:22:09,170 --> 10:22:13,950
9,046 and 6,500.

17742
10:22:14,150 --> 10:22:14,810
Okay, they do.

17743
10:22:15,010 --> 10:22:16,830
Oh, I'm kind of way beyond you.

17744
10:22:17,350 --> 10:22:18,830
Okay, that's fine.

17745
10:22:19,150 --> 10:22:20,050
I'll just keep going.

17746
10:22:20,650 --> 10:22:21,670
I'm just gonna keep going.

17747
10:22:22,070 --> 10:22:23,110
I'll just keep going.

17748
10:22:23,110 --> 10:22:24,930
I only have 4,000 blocks left.

17749
10:22:25,550 --> 10:22:26,250
Oh, you do?

17750
10:22:26,350 --> 10:22:26,730
Okay.

17751
10:22:28,510 --> 10:22:29,490
How about you?

17752
10:22:30,770 --> 10:22:31,230
Alright.

17753
10:22:33,730 --> 10:22:35,310
Oh, raw meat is fine?

17754
10:22:35,470 --> 10:22:36,890
Fuck, I don't need to cook this meat.

17755
10:22:37,810 --> 10:22:38,910
Oh my god.

17756
10:22:40,650 --> 10:22:41,610
4,000.

17757
10:22:42,970 --> 10:22:44,150
Okay, are they fully healed?

17758
10:22:44,910 --> 10:22:45,750
Okay, they are.

17759
10:22:45,830 --> 10:22:46,590
Alright, that's fine.

17760
10:22:47,830 --> 10:22:49,350
I'm in the ocean blue, everybody.

17761
10:22:49,690 --> 10:22:50,650
The parrot's in the bath.

17762
10:22:51,570 --> 10:22:53,370
Oh shit, they made a baby.

17763
10:22:53,570 --> 10:22:53,790
Okay.

17764
10:22:55,010 --> 10:22:56,570
Wait, can I have him?

17765
10:22:57,190 --> 10:22:59,110
No, he's my baby.

17766
10:22:59,710 --> 10:23:00,010
Oh.

17767
10:23:00,730 --> 10:23:01,970
You said I could have a dog.

17768
10:23:03,150 --> 10:23:04,830
You can find your own dog.

17769
10:23:04,830 --> 10:23:07,070
Okay, I'm finally like...

17770
10:23:07,070 --> 10:23:09,210
out of the ice and...

17771
10:23:09,210 --> 10:23:13,570
I'm gonna say there's no blocking, but I think I just hit a...

17772
10:23:13,570 --> 10:23:14,890
Yep, I just hit a block.

17773
10:23:15,090 --> 10:23:15,850
Oh my god.

17774
10:23:15,930 --> 10:23:16,690
How long did it take?

17775
10:23:18,010 --> 10:23:18,970
I don't know.

17776
10:23:19,490 --> 10:23:21,850
I'm at negative 8,500.

17777
10:23:23,130 --> 10:23:24,550
Okay, what about your Z?

17778
10:23:26,770 --> 10:23:27,730
5,260.

17779
10:23:30,810 --> 10:23:32,050
Wait for me!

17780
10:23:32,050 --> 10:23:33,610
Wait for me!

17781
10:23:33,630 --> 10:23:35,570
I tried waiting for you!

17782
10:23:35,970 --> 10:23:37,970
I tried waiting for you and then...

17783
10:23:37,970 --> 10:23:39,250
you went past me.

17784
10:23:39,890 --> 10:23:40,890
I stood still.

17785
10:23:40,990 --> 10:23:41,850
I waited for you.

17786
10:23:41,950 --> 10:23:44,050
I dealt with the phantoms while waiting for you.

17787
10:23:44,070 --> 10:23:46,650
I didn't know you were waiting for me!

17788
10:23:47,290 --> 10:23:49,210
You didn't say I was just...

17789
10:23:49,210 --> 10:23:49,950
Okay, then I'll wait.

17790
10:23:50,130 --> 10:23:51,730
Okay, I'll wait for you.

17791
10:23:51,870 --> 10:23:52,790
Okay, I'll wait for you.

17792
10:23:53,070 --> 10:23:54,730
Come to my location.

17793
10:23:55,550 --> 10:23:56,490
No, it's fine.

17794
10:23:56,530 --> 10:23:57,470
Just keep going.

17795
10:23:57,550 --> 10:23:58,410
Just keep going at this point.

17796
10:23:58,410 --> 10:23:59,850
Just keep going.

17797
10:24:00,150 --> 10:24:00,970
It's fine.

17798
10:24:01,590 --> 10:24:03,670
I found the biggest cave ever.

17799
10:24:03,890 --> 10:24:05,090
What have I just dropped in?

17800
10:24:09,300 --> 10:24:11,160
Where are we dropping, boys?

17801
10:24:12,000 --> 10:24:13,100
In this cave.

17802
10:24:16,240 --> 10:24:16,620
Hello?

17803
10:24:17,460 --> 10:24:19,860
Okay, I'm at...

17804
10:24:19,860 --> 10:24:22,780
8 ,600, but I'm still in ice.

17805
10:24:23,360 --> 10:24:25,040
I'm still in ice.

17806
10:24:25,040 --> 10:24:27,560
Go to the 5,000 Z, then.

17807
10:24:27,560 --> 10:24:29,040
And you'll get into regular land.

17808
10:24:34,440 --> 10:24:34,920
Alright.

17809
10:24:35,900 --> 10:24:36,380
Alright.

17810
10:24:38,480 --> 10:24:40,300
I'm waiting with some cows.

17811
10:24:41,200 --> 10:24:41,620
I'll wait.

17812
10:24:41,820 --> 10:24:43,260
Oh, you're gonna wait this time?

17813
10:24:43,340 --> 10:24:43,920
Yeah, I'm waiting.

17814
10:24:44,440 --> 10:24:45,620
No, just keep going.

17815
10:24:46,180 --> 10:24:46,920
It's fine.

17816
10:24:46,980 --> 10:24:48,360
We're all going to the same place anyway.

17817
10:24:48,860 --> 10:24:51,060
We're going to the same place.

17818
10:24:51,160 --> 10:24:51,680
I'm waiting.

17819
10:24:52,660 --> 10:24:55,180
Oh, I hear a zombie.

17820
10:24:55,180 --> 10:24:56,340
How?

17821
10:24:57,480 --> 10:24:58,800
I think he's underneath me.

17822
10:24:59,140 --> 10:24:59,840
In the cave.

17823
10:25:00,200 --> 10:25:01,160
The giant cave.

17824
10:25:03,220 --> 10:25:04,540
I think I see...

17825
10:25:04,540 --> 10:25:05,780
Is that a pirate ship?

17826
10:25:10,280 --> 10:25:10,920
What?

17827
10:25:13,960 --> 10:25:14,360
Doki?

17828
10:25:15,160 --> 10:25:16,160
Oh, yeah.

17829
10:25:16,300 --> 10:25:17,240
Avoid their babies.

17830
10:25:17,520 --> 10:25:17,980
Avoid the babies.

17831
10:25:18,260 --> 10:25:21,900
Yeah, I fucking swam into the polar bear.

17832
10:25:22,980 --> 10:25:24,140
That's your kind.

17833
10:25:24,340 --> 10:25:25,400
You wear the polar bear.

17834
10:25:25,520 --> 10:25:26,560
You wear the bear outfit.

17835
10:25:27,500 --> 10:25:28,980
I'm a grizzly bear.

17836
10:25:29,400 --> 10:25:30,640
We're different.

17837
10:25:31,220 --> 10:25:32,760
It's still a bear.

17838
10:25:33,260 --> 10:25:34,020
Oh, yeah?

17839
10:25:34,280 --> 10:25:36,580
Just because we're bears, we're all the same?

17840
10:25:36,660 --> 10:25:37,900
Yeah, bear bears.

17841
10:25:38,020 --> 10:25:39,100
We bear bears.

17842
10:25:40,880 --> 10:25:41,820
It's propaganda.

17843
10:25:42,460 --> 10:25:44,120
Oh, I thought that was you, but it was a cow.

17844
10:25:50,390 --> 10:25:51,810
Oh, my God.

17845
10:25:51,910 --> 10:25:52,690
We're losing it.

17846
10:25:52,750 --> 10:25:54,430
We're actually losing it.

17847
10:25:54,630 --> 10:25:56,310
Wait, what are the numbers?

17848
10:25:56,690 --> 10:25:58,950
I'm at negative 8,000.

17849
10:25:59,310 --> 10:26:00,690
No, not that.

17850
10:26:00,810 --> 10:26:02,870
I'm talking about what is the OG.

17851
10:26:03,490 --> 10:26:06,630
Oh, negative 4,116.

17852
10:26:07,210 --> 10:26:08,930
1,576.

17853
10:26:10,850 --> 10:26:11,750
Negative what?

17854
10:26:12,290 --> 10:26:14,610
4,116.

17855
10:26:14,610 --> 10:26:16,310
I'm in the ice.

17856
10:26:16,470 --> 10:26:18,610
And the Z is 1,576.

17857
10:26:20,090 --> 10:26:21,510
We're just a couple thousands away.

17858
10:26:24,350 --> 10:26:25,410
I'm in the ice.

17859
10:26:25,530 --> 10:26:26,790
I thought it was over.

17860
10:26:27,810 --> 10:26:30,370
I thought the ice stuff was over.

17861
10:26:30,590 --> 10:26:32,170
I thought it was over.

17862
10:26:32,390 --> 10:26:34,150
I was there before ice.

17863
10:26:34,250 --> 10:26:35,390
I'm on land.

17864
10:26:37,850 --> 10:26:39,650
I might die.

17865
10:26:39,770 --> 10:26:41,190
I actually might die.

17866
10:26:41,190 --> 10:26:43,410
Why are you gonna die from what?

17867
10:26:43,510 --> 10:26:44,370
You're just on ice.

17868
10:26:44,770 --> 10:26:45,550
I'm in ice.

17869
10:26:46,530 --> 10:26:48,690
My dogs are dying in ice.

17870
10:26:48,810 --> 10:26:49,550
I'm sorry.

17871
10:26:51,510 --> 10:26:52,630
Goodbye, doggos.

17872
10:26:53,030 --> 10:26:54,350
They can die.

17873
10:26:54,470 --> 10:26:54,970
It's fine.

17874
10:26:55,090 --> 10:26:56,390
Just as long as you stay alive.

17875
10:26:59,090 --> 10:27:01,590
Goodbye, my fellow doggos.

17876
10:27:01,930 --> 10:27:02,490
Goodbye.

17877
10:27:02,990 --> 10:27:05,070
I hear them dying in the ice.

17878
10:27:05,130 --> 10:27:06,910
How are they in the ice?

17879
10:27:07,950 --> 10:27:08,770
I'm sorry.

17880
10:27:08,790 --> 10:27:10,650
How are you in the ice?

17881
10:27:11,470 --> 10:27:12,150
I'm sorry.

17882
10:27:12,630 --> 10:27:14,130
I'm so sorry.

17883
10:27:14,490 --> 10:27:15,590
I didn't know.

17884
10:27:17,590 --> 10:27:18,210
Oh my god.

17885
10:27:18,970 --> 10:27:20,510
Goodbye, my doggos.

17886
10:27:20,790 --> 10:27:21,390
Goodbye.

17887
10:27:22,410 --> 10:27:24,530
I'm like two steps away from the ice.

17888
10:27:24,630 --> 10:27:25,170
Where are you?

17889
10:27:25,270 --> 10:27:26,250
What's your coordinate?

17890
10:27:27,370 --> 10:27:29,730
We're gonna see a doggo die in the ice.

17891
10:27:30,770 --> 10:27:33,110
We're gonna see it happen.

17892
10:27:33,610 --> 10:27:35,370
I don't have anywhere to be.

17893
10:27:35,370 --> 10:27:38,670
I don't have anywhere to be.

17894
10:27:38,990 --> 10:27:39,790
Why is he dying?

17895
10:27:39,950 --> 10:27:41,030
Is he like trapped underneath?

17896
10:27:42,510 --> 10:27:43,870
What does that mean?

17897
10:27:44,630 --> 10:27:46,790
Why don't you just move and they teleport?

17898
10:27:48,710 --> 10:27:50,510
Oh, the baby died.

17899
10:27:50,610 --> 10:27:50,950
Okay.

17900
10:27:51,170 --> 10:27:53,870
Why don't you just move and they teleport with you?

17901
10:27:54,310 --> 10:27:57,170
Because I was also trapped in the ice.

17902
10:27:57,230 --> 10:27:58,050
What do you want me to say?

17903
10:27:58,250 --> 10:27:58,950
Oh my god.

17904
10:27:58,950 --> 10:28:00,750
Why are you trapped in the ice?

17905
10:28:02,930 --> 10:28:04,330
What do you want me to say?

17906
10:28:04,330 --> 10:28:05,850
How are you trapped in the ice?

17907
10:28:05,930 --> 10:28:07,630
You just go around it.

17908
10:28:09,450 --> 10:28:11,170
It's already too late.

17909
10:28:11,250 --> 10:28:12,230
The baby's dead.

17910
10:28:12,330 --> 10:28:12,850
It's alright.

17911
10:28:13,270 --> 10:28:13,670
Oh wait, no.

17912
10:28:13,690 --> 10:28:14,190
He's alive.

17913
10:28:14,310 --> 10:28:14,750
Hello there.

17914
10:28:15,070 --> 10:28:15,650
See?

17915
10:28:15,930 --> 10:28:16,910
Everything's fine.

17916
10:28:17,150 --> 10:28:18,170
Come to my location.

17917
10:28:20,190 --> 10:28:21,390
I'm at...

17918
10:28:21,390 --> 10:28:27,270
negative 8,559 5,265 Alright.

17919
10:28:27,710 --> 10:28:29,130
Anyway, I'm at negative 8,300 now.

17920
10:28:29,150 --> 10:28:30,630
Oh, you're in the powdered snow.

17921
10:28:30,630 --> 10:28:32,890
Oh see, I told you you needed a bucket.

17922
10:28:34,430 --> 10:28:36,090
You took all my iron.

17923
10:28:36,310 --> 10:28:37,790
You gave me all your iron.

17924
10:28:38,230 --> 10:28:39,630
You took all my iron.

17925
10:28:39,970 --> 10:28:42,890
What did you want from me?

17926
10:28:43,190 --> 10:28:43,930
You took all...

17927
10:28:44,570 --> 10:28:45,310
I'm not there.

17928
10:28:45,450 --> 10:28:46,870
I'm not going where you are.

17929
10:28:47,010 --> 10:28:48,090
I'm fucking... I'm gone.

17930
10:28:48,350 --> 10:28:48,930
I'm gone.

17931
10:28:49,050 --> 10:28:49,570
Just go.

17932
10:28:49,970 --> 10:28:50,270
Fine.

17933
10:28:50,530 --> 10:28:50,970
Fine.

17934
10:28:51,330 --> 10:28:51,850
Fine.

17935
10:28:52,270 --> 10:28:54,490
I was here waiting for you.

17936
10:28:54,730 --> 10:28:55,850
I told you.

17937
10:28:56,130 --> 10:28:57,210
I told you.

17938
10:28:57,210 --> 10:28:57,610
Just go.

17939
10:28:57,810 --> 10:28:58,850
Just go.

17940
10:28:59,090 --> 10:28:59,090
Fine.

17941
10:28:59,210 --> 10:28:59,830
I'm going.

17942
10:29:00,030 --> 10:29:00,610
I'm going.

17943
10:29:01,070 --> 10:29:03,030
It's almost night time.

17944
10:29:03,150 --> 10:29:04,170
And I'm scared.

17945
10:29:04,850 --> 10:29:05,690
No, you're not.

17946
10:29:06,250 --> 10:29:07,290
There's a baby.

17947
10:29:08,090 --> 10:29:09,370
There you go.

17948
10:29:09,650 --> 10:29:11,950
I'm trying to give the baby some meat right now.

17949
10:29:13,250 --> 10:29:15,330
The last meat that I have.

17950
10:29:15,350 --> 10:29:17,330
This is why you're not supposed to have animals.

17951
10:29:18,130 --> 10:29:19,170
You have no attachments.

17952
10:29:19,810 --> 10:29:22,110
I did not want them to breed.

17953
10:29:22,550 --> 10:29:24,930
They just got close to each other.

17954
10:29:24,930 --> 10:29:27,250
They got close to each other and they just...

17955
10:29:27,250 --> 10:29:29,250
That's why you neuter them.

17956
10:29:29,370 --> 10:29:31,070
You want me to stop love.

17957
10:29:31,870 --> 10:29:33,390
You have to cut off their bones.

17958
10:29:33,410 --> 10:29:34,150
Where are the doctors?

17959
10:29:34,450 --> 10:29:36,750
We've been in the wilds for 20 years.

17960
10:29:37,070 --> 10:29:39,110
Where can I go to the doctors?

17961
10:29:39,190 --> 10:29:40,290
You do it yourself.

17962
10:29:40,490 --> 10:29:42,550
This is how cavemen learn.

17963
10:29:43,110 --> 10:29:43,810
Did you do it yourself?

17964
10:29:44,710 --> 10:29:45,670
I don't have pets.

17965
10:29:47,470 --> 10:29:49,190
You have cats.

17966
10:29:49,370 --> 10:29:50,970
No, I'm talking about in Minecraft.

17967
10:29:55,390 --> 10:29:56,590
What was I gonna say?

17968
10:29:56,670 --> 10:29:58,290
You don't see your cat as a pet?

17969
10:29:58,570 --> 10:30:00,050
No, they're family.

17970
10:30:01,610 --> 10:30:03,730
That's why you don't neuter family, I guess.

17971
10:30:03,830 --> 10:30:05,550
Yeah, don't neuter your family, everybody.

17972
10:30:10,770 --> 10:30:13,150
Oops, I accidentally reloaded.

17973
10:30:13,610 --> 10:30:15,150
Wait, no, that's not what I meant to do.

17974
10:30:15,250 --> 10:30:15,950
F3, there we go.

17975
10:30:15,970 --> 10:30:16,250
I'm moving.

17976
10:30:18,530 --> 10:30:20,010
Guys, if I could find...

17977
10:30:20,010 --> 10:30:22,870
If I could find wild animals right now...

17978
10:30:22,870 --> 10:30:25,290
Wild chickens or lambs or whatever...

17979
10:30:25,290 --> 10:30:27,170
I would, but I'm stuck here.

17980
10:30:27,330 --> 10:30:29,150
In this ice tundra.

17981
10:30:33,050 --> 10:30:34,330
We're so close.

17982
10:30:34,590 --> 10:30:35,430
We're so close.

17983
10:30:36,710 --> 10:30:38,570
I'm just rowing my boat.

17984
10:30:38,970 --> 10:30:39,410
Me too.

17985
10:30:40,390 --> 10:30:42,030
Just heading northeast.

17986
10:30:42,330 --> 10:30:44,710
Just heading northeast until...

17987
10:30:44,710 --> 10:30:46,070
Until it's over.

17988
10:30:46,330 --> 10:30:47,970
No, where's one?

17989
10:30:48,470 --> 10:30:51,050
My boat has to end.

17990
10:30:52,090 --> 10:30:52,570
Why?

17991
10:30:53,670 --> 10:30:54,630
What happened?

17992
10:30:54,870 --> 10:30:56,110
The water ended.

17993
10:30:56,370 --> 10:30:58,390
I don't know where you are or where I am.

17994
10:30:58,730 --> 10:30:59,830
I don't know anymore.

17995
10:30:59,990 --> 10:31:00,870
I'm just rowing.

17996
10:31:01,030 --> 10:31:03,730
I'm just rowing until we made it there.

17997
10:31:03,790 --> 10:31:05,330
I wonder if we're even close.

17998
10:31:06,230 --> 10:31:07,050
We're close.

17999
10:31:07,150 --> 10:31:08,790
We're getting there.

18000
10:31:08,950 --> 10:31:10,810
We're getting there.

18001
10:31:11,690 --> 10:31:12,990
Then we'll have all our stuff, everybody.

18002
10:31:13,150 --> 10:31:14,690
And then we'll be able to continue the game.

18003
10:31:15,530 --> 10:31:17,670
And then we're basically at the end.

18004
10:31:17,670 --> 10:31:19,650
We're basically at the end at that point.

18005
10:31:19,650 --> 10:31:20,870
That's where...

18006
10:31:20,870 --> 10:31:22,210
That's what happens.

18007
10:31:24,390 --> 10:31:27,210
Why did the connection reset?

18008
10:31:27,990 --> 10:31:32,850
What happened to our server?

18009
10:31:33,470 --> 10:31:34,210
What happened?

18010
10:31:34,870 --> 10:31:35,670
What happened?

18011
10:31:36,510 --> 10:31:37,910
Go back!

18012
10:31:38,150 --> 10:31:38,610
Go back!

18013
10:31:38,610 --> 10:31:41,190
Go back!

18014
10:31:42,470 --> 10:31:45,150
Where am I?

18015
10:31:45,330 --> 10:31:45,930
Where am I?

18016
10:31:45,930 --> 10:31:46,630
Where am I?

18017
10:31:47,530 --> 10:31:48,450
I'm back!

18018
10:31:48,570 --> 10:31:49,090
I'm back!

18019
10:31:49,310 --> 10:31:50,590
Before the ice!

18020
10:31:52,310 --> 10:31:53,550
Back in the ice?

18021
10:31:54,310 --> 10:31:55,870
I'm back in the ice!

18022
10:31:56,650 --> 10:31:58,490
I'm back in the ice!

18023
10:31:58,790 --> 10:32:00,530
I'm back in the ice!

18024
10:32:01,130 --> 10:32:01,890
I'm back in the ice!

18025
10:32:02,410 --> 10:32:04,210
How did I get back here?

18026
10:32:04,550 --> 10:32:06,250
How did I get back here?

18027
10:32:07,550 --> 10:32:08,950
Did you lose anything?

18028
10:32:10,190 --> 10:32:11,470
No, I didn't.

18029
10:32:11,730 --> 10:32:13,930
I have to roll back!

18030
10:32:13,930 --> 10:32:16,390
I have to roll!

18031
10:32:19,790 --> 10:32:21,410
I'm just running.

18032
10:32:21,590 --> 10:32:22,690
I don't care anymore.

18033
10:32:22,770 --> 10:32:23,490
I'm just running.

18034
10:32:25,670 --> 10:32:28,390
This is a fucking re-zero shit.

18035
10:32:32,870 --> 10:32:34,310
Don't worry about them!

18036
10:32:34,510 --> 10:32:35,570
Come on, just go!

18037
10:32:35,690 --> 10:32:36,590
We have to run!

18038
10:32:38,210 --> 10:32:40,370
We have to just go!

18039
10:32:40,370 --> 10:32:41,850
Where am I?

18040
10:32:42,690 --> 10:32:43,990
We just have to go!

18041
10:32:44,270 --> 10:32:45,530
We just have to go!

18042
10:32:46,550 --> 10:32:48,330
We just have to go!

18043
10:32:48,470 --> 10:32:49,010
Northeast!

18044
10:32:50,110 --> 10:32:52,250
Even the dogs are gone!

18045
10:32:52,650 --> 10:32:54,070
Where did the dogs go?

18046
10:33:03,550 --> 10:33:05,630
It's fine, I can roll again.

18047
10:33:05,990 --> 10:33:07,510
I can roll again.

18048
10:33:09,690 --> 10:33:10,850
Uh-oh.

18049
10:33:10,870 --> 10:33:11,750
Wait, I went the wrong way.

18050
10:33:12,230 --> 10:33:12,450
Gosh.

18051
10:33:20,330 --> 10:33:22,850
They are in a better place.

18052
10:33:23,070 --> 10:33:24,510
In Java Wonderland.

18053
10:33:25,790 --> 10:33:28,890
That's what happens in the Minecraft server.

18054
10:33:29,030 --> 10:33:30,710
Everybody goes to Java Wonderland.

18055
10:33:31,190 --> 10:33:32,030
Oh, I found a village!

18056
10:33:37,510 --> 10:33:42,910
I had a delirious dream because of like frostbite or some shit.

18057
10:33:43,570 --> 10:33:46,730
You never had the dogs.

18058
10:33:48,590 --> 10:33:50,890
You were just pulling two rocks on a stick.

18059
10:33:52,570 --> 10:33:55,050
The frostbite got me.

18060
10:33:55,970 --> 10:33:58,370
The day restarted too though.

18061
10:33:59,270 --> 10:34:02,710
Because we were about to hit night time and the day restarted.

18062
10:34:03,070 --> 10:34:05,150
What happened to the server?

18063
10:34:05,150 --> 10:34:06,330
What happened?

18064
10:34:06,690 --> 10:34:09,590
You need to get a refund from wherever you look.

18065
10:34:09,690 --> 10:34:11,530
The dogs were never real.

18066
10:34:12,210 --> 10:34:13,890
The dogs were never real.

18067
10:34:14,510 --> 10:34:17,450
I was going through some fucking shit.

18068
10:34:19,190 --> 10:34:21,530
But you saw them too!

18069
10:34:22,070 --> 10:34:23,950
What are you talking about?

18070
10:34:24,030 --> 10:34:25,230
What are you talking about?

18071
10:34:25,510 --> 10:34:26,470
What do you mean?

18072
10:34:26,470 --> 10:34:28,810
You literally had two rocks on a stick.

18073
10:34:28,990 --> 10:34:29,970
Or on a string.

18074
10:34:30,390 --> 10:34:32,350
No, they were real.

18075
10:34:32,350 --> 10:34:34,890
You were encouraging the dogs!

18076
10:34:35,390 --> 10:34:39,630
You had always just two rocks on a string and you were like, my dogs.

18077
10:34:39,710 --> 10:34:40,790
I was like, just leave them.

18078
10:34:40,890 --> 10:34:41,930
They're rocks.

18079
10:34:48,550 --> 10:34:50,390
Oh no, I don't wanna go in there.

18080
10:34:50,590 --> 10:34:51,250
Oh man.

18081
10:34:51,850 --> 10:34:53,510
The dogs were never real.

18082
10:34:53,730 --> 10:34:55,070
The dogs were never real.

18083
10:34:55,690 --> 10:34:56,690
I don't wanna go in there.

18084
10:34:56,770 --> 10:34:57,770
I might die in here.

18085
10:34:58,870 --> 10:34:59,650
Oh gosh.

18086
10:34:59,650 --> 10:34:59,710
Oh gosh.

18087
10:35:00,810 --> 10:35:02,770
It gets dark in here, guys.

18088
10:35:02,770 --> 10:35:02,890
The dogs were never real.

18089
10:35:04,190 --> 10:35:05,730
They were never real.

18090
10:35:06,550 --> 10:35:07,990
They were never real.

18091
10:35:09,870 --> 10:35:11,950
They were just in my head.

18092
10:35:12,310 --> 10:35:17,650
Just a dream, just like this fever dream that we're experiencing right now.

18093
10:35:19,770 --> 10:35:21,150
They were never real.

18094
10:35:21,290 --> 10:35:22,350
When does it end?

18095
10:35:22,490 --> 10:35:24,230
When does it end?

18096
10:35:24,290 --> 10:35:26,130
When does the Minecraft end?

18097
10:35:26,130 --> 10:35:27,270
It's gonna end.

18098
10:35:27,270 --> 10:35:29,030
I don't wanna play Minecraft anymore!

18099
10:35:29,590 --> 10:35:31,070
It's gonna end.

18100
10:35:31,150 --> 10:35:33,310
Just keep on moving.

18101
10:35:33,630 --> 10:35:35,070
Just keep on moving.

18102
10:35:35,450 --> 10:35:36,630
The moment...

18103
10:35:36,630 --> 10:35:40,830
The moment we get to that area, we're done.

18104
10:35:40,950 --> 10:35:42,670
We're almost to the end at that point.

18105
10:35:42,870 --> 10:35:44,030
We're literally...

18106
10:35:44,030 --> 10:35:48,090
All our stuff to make it to the end is in that chest.

18107
10:35:48,410 --> 10:35:50,490
We have to kill the dragon.

18108
10:35:50,890 --> 10:35:53,570
We have everything we need.

18109
10:35:53,570 --> 10:35:56,330
We just need the phantom thing and then the redstone.

18110
10:35:56,830 --> 10:36:00,550
We're gonna get to the redstone and then I'll farm the phantom.

18111
10:36:00,710 --> 10:36:02,650
You go get redstone, I farm phantom.

18112
10:36:03,110 --> 10:36:04,450
And then it's all over.

18113
10:36:04,690 --> 10:36:06,630
And then it's over and we're free.

18114
10:36:07,290 --> 10:36:08,410
And we'll be free.

18115
10:36:08,850 --> 10:36:10,170
Oh my god, there's zombies in here.

18116
10:36:10,970 --> 10:36:12,290
I'm in the scary woods.

18117
10:36:12,930 --> 10:36:14,770
I'm still in the snow.

18118
10:36:15,230 --> 10:36:16,630
Where the hell are you?

18119
10:36:17,210 --> 10:36:19,550
How am I still in the snow?

18120
10:36:20,570 --> 10:36:22,110
How are you still in the snow?

18121
10:36:22,110 --> 10:36:23,590
I don't know anymore.

18122
10:36:23,710 --> 10:36:24,710
I'm still there.

18123
10:36:27,570 --> 10:36:28,230
Oh my god.

18124
10:36:29,070 --> 10:36:29,530
Woah!

18125
10:36:30,130 --> 10:36:31,170
Lush biome.

18126
10:36:31,610 --> 10:36:31,970
Anyway.

18127
10:36:34,630 --> 10:36:35,830
It's fine, I got dirt.

18128
10:36:35,930 --> 10:36:36,570
I got dirt.

18129
10:36:38,330 --> 10:36:39,790
Uh oh, it's starting to get dark.

18130
10:36:41,070 --> 10:36:43,450
Oh man, why did they go by so fast?

18131
10:36:43,570 --> 10:36:44,890
Server, you were supposed to break!

18132
10:36:44,930 --> 10:36:45,470
What happened?

18133
10:36:48,670 --> 10:36:50,870
I feel like I've been running for years.

18134
10:36:51,070 --> 10:36:52,330
I've been running for years.

18135
10:36:54,010 --> 10:36:56,310
And running and running and running for years.

18136
10:36:56,510 --> 10:36:57,270
And running for years.

18137
10:36:57,510 --> 10:36:58,950
Oh my god, there's another dog.

18138
10:36:59,010 --> 10:37:00,770
Get over here.

18139
10:37:01,410 --> 10:37:02,330
I knew you were real.

18140
10:37:03,230 --> 10:37:05,270
I got dogs!

18141
10:37:06,450 --> 10:37:07,290
No, please.

18142
10:37:08,370 --> 10:37:09,450
Let me out of here.

18143
10:37:09,610 --> 10:37:11,050
Just put me in the ocean please.

18144
10:37:11,130 --> 10:37:12,190
I don't want to be up here.

18145
10:37:12,890 --> 10:37:14,010
I got the dogs.

18146
10:37:15,210 --> 10:37:16,070
I'm in the trees.

18147
10:37:16,250 --> 10:37:17,870
I'm a fucking monkey right now.

18148
10:37:17,870 --> 10:37:18,690
Oh my god.

18149
10:37:20,470 --> 10:37:22,050
How do I get down from...

18150
10:37:22,050 --> 10:37:23,410
Oh god, how do I get down from here?

18151
10:37:25,250 --> 10:37:27,750
I think I'm camping in the trees tonight.

18152
10:37:28,010 --> 10:37:28,750
Oh no.

18153
10:37:29,550 --> 10:37:30,930
Can't see anything.

18154
10:37:31,110 --> 10:37:32,570
I'm camping in the trees tonight.

18155
10:37:34,650 --> 10:37:36,450
I can't see anything.

18156
10:37:36,910 --> 10:37:40,210
I can't see anything anymore.

18157
10:37:40,430 --> 10:37:42,030
Everything is so dark.

18158
10:37:44,170 --> 10:37:45,330
Use your torches.

18159
10:37:45,330 --> 10:37:45,370
Use your torches.

18160
10:37:47,070 --> 10:37:48,430
Can't see anything.

18161
10:37:49,130 --> 10:37:49,530
Are you dead?

18162
10:37:51,370 --> 10:37:52,910
It's so dark.

18163
10:37:53,190 --> 10:37:54,690
It's so dark and cold.

18164
10:37:56,290 --> 10:37:57,190
What's your coordinates?

18165
10:37:57,430 --> 10:37:58,030
What are your coordinates?

18166
10:37:58,310 --> 10:37:58,990
I'm just curious.

18167
10:37:59,690 --> 10:38:00,130
Okay.

18168
10:38:01,550 --> 10:38:04,310
How did I make no progress?

18169
10:38:04,590 --> 10:38:05,910
How did I make no progress?

18170
10:38:06,170 --> 10:38:06,270
How did I make no progress?

18171
10:38:06,270 --> 10:38:10,630
I had 4000 left and now I'm at 4000 still.

18172
10:38:11,330 --> 10:38:11,650
How?

18173
10:38:11,650 --> 10:38:12,030
How?

18174
10:38:12,450 --> 10:38:13,970
I don't know anymore.

18175
10:38:14,310 --> 10:38:16,810
I don't know anymore.

18176
10:38:17,410 --> 10:38:18,770
I don't know.

18177
10:38:19,010 --> 10:38:20,030
I don't know.

18178
10:38:20,150 --> 10:38:20,590
I'm out.

18179
10:38:20,690 --> 10:38:22,610
I'm out of the fucking...

18180
10:38:22,610 --> 10:38:25,570
Oh my god, I'm finally out.

18181
10:38:26,130 --> 10:38:29,570
I'm finally out of this godforsaken night.

18182
10:38:30,170 --> 10:38:32,350
I'm just gonna sleep through this night.

18183
10:38:32,950 --> 10:38:34,410
No, no, you're not.

18184
10:38:34,490 --> 10:38:36,290
You cannot sleep through the night because...

18185
10:38:36,290 --> 10:38:38,970
Let's yell when it becomes the daytime in the game.

18186
10:38:38,970 --> 10:38:41,170
No, no, no, no, no.

18187
10:38:42,370 --> 10:38:43,550
No, no, no.

18188
10:38:43,770 --> 10:38:44,170
I'm trapped.

18189
10:38:46,090 --> 10:38:47,910
I'm trapped in the trees.

18190
10:38:48,050 --> 10:38:49,170
I can't see.

18191
10:38:50,210 --> 10:38:51,270
Where's my torch?

18192
10:38:52,090 --> 10:38:52,490
Okay.

18193
10:38:53,810 --> 10:38:54,330
Alright.

18194
10:38:58,470 --> 10:38:59,490
Okay, it's this way.

18195
10:39:00,270 --> 10:39:00,770
It's this way.

18196
10:39:00,890 --> 10:39:01,050
Alright.

18197
10:39:01,990 --> 10:39:03,730
Alright, I can't see much.

18198
10:39:04,290 --> 10:39:06,210
But I know I'm going the right way.

18199
10:39:07,890 --> 10:39:09,990
I know I'm going...

18200
10:39:09,990 --> 10:39:10,490
What are you?

18201
10:39:10,510 --> 10:39:13,890
I'm at 7,833.

18202
10:39:14,150 --> 10:39:15,810
4,060.

18203
10:39:16,990 --> 10:39:17,670
Oh, okay.

18204
10:39:17,730 --> 10:39:18,570
You're further than me.

18205
10:39:19,030 --> 10:39:20,070
Okay, where are you?

18206
10:39:20,450 --> 10:39:22,770
7,995.

18207
10:39:22,890 --> 10:39:24,570
4,281.

18208
10:39:25,070 --> 10:39:26,970
Okay, your Z is further though.

18209
10:39:28,090 --> 10:39:28,690
Oh.

18210
10:39:29,550 --> 10:39:30,950
Yeah, you have more Z's.

18211
10:39:31,250 --> 10:39:34,210
I'm at...

18212
10:39:34,210 --> 10:39:37,470
I've got the tinnitus and lighting the pathway for me, so I can't see shit.

18213
10:39:40,850 --> 10:39:42,330
Phantom, come and get me.

18214
10:39:42,530 --> 10:39:43,390
Phantom, please.

18215
10:39:44,110 --> 10:39:46,390
Phantom, where the fuck are the...

18216
10:39:46,790 --> 10:39:48,710
I'm like trapped in the trees, you guys.

18217
10:39:48,790 --> 10:39:49,970
I don't know how to get down.

18218
10:39:52,490 --> 10:39:54,930
I don't want to be in the trees anymore.

18219
10:39:55,070 --> 10:39:56,110
I don't want to be a tree person.

18220
10:39:57,810 --> 10:39:59,250
Oh my god, that cow scared me.

18221
10:40:00,030 --> 10:40:02,230
I don't want to be in the trees.

18222
10:40:02,230 --> 10:40:03,930
I can't see anything.

18223
10:40:04,130 --> 10:40:05,030
It's so dark.

18224
10:40:05,530 --> 10:40:07,390
The things I do for a phantom.

18225
10:40:08,670 --> 10:40:09,290
I know, right?

18226
10:40:09,450 --> 10:40:10,250
Should we just sleep?

18227
10:40:11,330 --> 10:40:11,870
No.

18228
10:40:13,330 --> 10:40:14,330
We're committed.

18229
10:40:14,970 --> 10:40:17,110
Oh my god, there's skellies in the trees.

18230
10:40:17,770 --> 10:40:18,010
No!

18231
10:40:19,410 --> 10:40:20,870
How do I get around you guys?

18232
10:40:22,230 --> 10:40:22,790
Burn it?

18233
10:40:22,830 --> 10:40:23,570
Burn it down?

18234
10:40:23,910 --> 10:40:25,250
I might die too.

18235
10:40:25,390 --> 10:40:26,190
I might burn you.

18236
10:40:27,430 --> 10:40:28,930
Just burn everything down.

18237
10:40:28,930 --> 10:40:30,210
Oh, phantom!

18238
10:40:30,630 --> 10:40:31,330
I have a phantom.

18239
10:40:32,130 --> 10:40:34,790
I have two of them!

18240
10:40:35,250 --> 10:40:35,510
Hit!

18241
10:40:36,470 --> 10:40:38,090
I hit them, I think.

18242
10:40:41,310 --> 10:40:42,230
Where are you?

18243
10:40:44,010 --> 10:40:44,570
I hit them.

18244
10:40:46,670 --> 10:40:47,590
Oh shoot!

18245
10:40:47,950 --> 10:40:48,770
I hit him.

18246
10:40:50,270 --> 10:40:51,810
Come on, phantom!

18247
10:40:53,250 --> 10:40:53,890
Hit!

18248
10:40:55,070 --> 10:40:55,450
Nice!

18249
10:40:55,450 --> 10:40:56,430
Oh no!

18250
10:40:56,650 --> 10:40:56,750
Hit!

18251
10:40:56,990 --> 10:40:57,950
I missed.

18252
10:40:58,690 --> 10:41:01,170
Oh my god, there's creepers and zombies coming after me.

18253
10:41:01,510 --> 10:41:02,450
Oh my god, there's a zombie coming.

18254
10:41:05,050 --> 10:41:05,570
Yeah!

18255
10:41:06,590 --> 10:41:07,110
Membrane!

18256
10:41:07,950 --> 10:41:08,570
We got it!

18257
10:41:08,570 --> 10:41:09,530
We got two membranes!

18258
10:41:09,710 --> 10:41:11,010
How many membranes do we need?

18259
10:41:12,130 --> 10:41:13,330
A lot, I think.

18260
10:41:16,230 --> 10:41:17,570
Leave me alone!

18261
10:41:19,210 --> 10:41:21,410
How many membranes do we need?

18262
10:41:23,010 --> 10:41:25,940
Two membranes!

18263
10:41:25,940 --> 10:41:27,080
Oh nice, nice, nice!

18264
10:41:28,060 --> 10:41:28,480
Four!

18265
10:41:29,840 --> 10:41:31,160
Wait, four per potion?

18266
10:41:34,120 --> 10:41:36,260
One membrane equals three potions.

18267
10:41:36,440 --> 10:41:36,980
Oh, okay.

18268
10:41:37,860 --> 10:41:38,720
Then we're good.

18269
10:41:39,240 --> 10:41:39,700
Yeah, we're good.

18270
10:41:39,760 --> 10:41:41,480
We already got what we needed and we're fine.

18271
10:41:41,740 --> 10:41:44,380
Oh no, I think we can get a little few more, right?

18272
10:41:44,680 --> 10:41:46,580
Because I have one as well, so we...

18273
10:41:46,580 --> 10:41:48,030
Yeah, but I think we can manage...

18274
10:41:48,480 --> 10:41:49,560
I think we can...

18275
10:41:49,560 --> 10:41:51,220
Oh gosh, there's creepers everywhere.

18276
10:41:51,480 --> 10:41:52,380
Please leave me alone.

18277
10:41:53,340 --> 10:41:54,880
I'm stuck in the trees, Donkey!

18278
10:41:55,200 --> 10:41:56,060
I'm stuck in the trees!

18279
10:41:56,080 --> 10:42:00,000
I need to make my bed, but there's too many monsters.

18280
10:42:00,260 --> 10:42:01,900
I'm stuck in the trees!

18281
10:42:03,440 --> 10:42:04,400
Oh my god!

18282
10:42:05,620 --> 10:42:07,800
Oh my god, what's your coordinates?

18283
10:42:07,980 --> 10:42:08,720
Where are we at?

18284
10:42:09,160 --> 10:42:10,500
I haven't moved!

18285
10:42:10,740 --> 10:42:11,660
I'm stuck in the trees!

18286
10:42:11,960 --> 10:42:13,540
Oh, you are stuck in the trees.

18287
10:42:13,640 --> 10:42:15,280
I didn't know when you said you were stuck in the trees.

18288
10:42:15,600 --> 10:42:17,580
I didn't realize you were stuck, stuck in the trees.

18289
10:42:17,620 --> 10:42:19,300
I'm stuck, stuck in the trees!

18290
10:42:19,300 --> 10:42:19,440
I'm stuck in the trees!

18291
10:42:21,260 --> 10:42:22,780
This is so stupid.

18292
10:42:28,080 --> 10:42:28,580
Alright,

18293
10:42:31,740 --> 10:42:31,940
guys.

18294
10:42:33,740 --> 10:42:34,700
I'm gonna keep running.

18295
10:42:36,580 --> 10:42:37,560
I'm gonna keep running.

18296
10:42:37,600 --> 10:42:38,480
I'm gonna keep running too.

18297
10:42:38,960 --> 10:42:39,960
I'm gonna keep running.

18298
10:42:40,180 --> 10:42:40,480
Run!

18299
10:42:42,820 --> 10:42:44,060
Through the forest!

18300
10:42:44,100 --> 10:42:44,960
I'm almost done.

18301
10:42:44,960 --> 10:42:46,560
I'm at 4,000...

18302
10:42:46,560 --> 10:42:49,420
7,493...

18303
10:42:49,420 --> 10:42:51,120
4,200...

18304
10:42:51,120 --> 10:42:51,700
I can't check right now.

18305
10:42:52,040 --> 10:42:54,260
3,000 C's away and...

18306
10:42:54,260 --> 10:42:57,020
3,000 X's away!

18307
10:42:57,220 --> 10:42:57,540
Okay!

18308
10:43:01,000 --> 10:43:02,560
We're running, running...

18309
10:43:03,840 --> 10:43:06,020
We're so close.

18310
10:43:07,900 --> 10:43:09,060
Oh, that was a sheep.

18311
10:43:09,680 --> 10:43:10,700
Don't scare me, sheep.

18312
10:43:11,160 --> 10:43:12,200
I almost tried to kill you.

18313
10:43:15,180 --> 10:43:17,740
I hate... Can I just get some water, please?

18314
10:43:17,880 --> 10:43:19,240
Like, that I can...

18315
10:43:19,240 --> 10:43:20,840
Oh my god, no, this is a bad area.

18316
10:43:21,040 --> 10:43:22,960
When it's daytime, I can fucking...

18317
10:43:23,540 --> 10:43:24,740
I will be able to...

18318
10:43:24,740 --> 10:43:26,680
I'll be able to make more...

18319
10:43:26,680 --> 10:43:28,460
Make more bread.

18320
10:43:29,320 --> 10:43:30,960
I just need it to be daytime.

18321
10:43:31,100 --> 10:43:32,380
We can sleep, probably!

18322
10:43:32,740 --> 10:43:33,780
Oh wait, the day is breaking!

18323
10:43:34,060 --> 10:43:34,660
The dawn is breaking!

18324
10:43:34,880 --> 10:43:35,720
Oh no, that's a village.

18325
10:43:35,980 --> 10:43:36,920
No, that's a village, nevermind.

18326
10:43:37,220 --> 10:43:37,820
That's good, that's good!

18327
10:43:37,900 --> 10:43:38,540
Find some books!

18328
10:43:38,660 --> 10:43:39,360
Find some books!

18329
10:43:39,820 --> 10:43:41,000
They're on the other side!

18330
10:43:41,060 --> 10:43:41,840
I can't reach them!

18331
10:43:42,540 --> 10:43:43,320
Oh no!

18332
10:43:43,900 --> 10:43:45,300
It's falling apart into the sky!

18333
10:43:45,500 --> 10:43:46,320
Find a way!

18334
10:43:46,740 --> 10:43:48,520
Ok, I'll try.

18335
10:43:50,100 --> 10:43:51,480
I can probably...

18336
10:43:51,480 --> 10:43:53,700
Do you think if I jump, you can... No, I don't think I can make it.

18337
10:43:53,800 --> 10:43:55,760
What were the coordinates again?

18338
10:43:56,000 --> 10:43:57,340
I don't think I can make it.

18339
10:43:57,860 --> 10:43:58,840
Phantom swoops again?

18340
10:43:59,020 --> 10:44:00,080
Oh my god, I'm getting another phantom.

18341
10:44:01,680 --> 10:44:02,540
Where is he?

18342
10:44:03,640 --> 10:44:04,320
Where is he?

18343
10:44:04,860 --> 10:44:07,140
Hello, Phantom?

18344
10:44:08,480 --> 10:44:09,200
Phantom, where are you?

18345
10:44:09,200 --> 10:44:09,660
Oh, there he is!

18346
10:44:09,700 --> 10:44:10,420
He's stuck in the trees!

18347
10:44:11,880 --> 10:44:12,660
Idiot, Phantom!

18348
10:44:13,220 --> 10:44:14,420
Wait, I think...

18349
10:44:17,000 --> 10:44:18,180
Hold on, guys.

18350
10:44:18,380 --> 10:44:18,800
Hold on.

18351
10:44:20,260 --> 10:44:21,240
Phantom, where did he go?

18352
10:44:24,980 --> 10:44:26,020
He bit me?

18353
10:44:27,240 --> 10:44:28,940
No, you're gonna turn into one of them.

18354
10:44:29,160 --> 10:44:30,740
I am a phantom already.

18355
10:44:35,040 --> 10:44:35,840
I'm already...

18356
10:44:35,840 --> 10:44:38,980
Luckily, nothing is spawning around me, but I need to kill him before...

18357
10:44:38,980 --> 10:44:39,500
Daybreak!

18358
10:44:40,400 --> 10:44:41,780
Oh no, daybreak is coming!

18359
10:44:43,100 --> 10:44:43,880
I need to kill him!

18360
10:44:44,840 --> 10:44:45,720
Thank god.

18361
10:44:47,120 --> 10:44:49,460
Don't hide there, you stupid idiot!

18362
10:44:49,520 --> 10:44:50,540
Do I not need...

18363
10:44:51,140 --> 10:44:52,260
I have so many...

18364
10:44:52,260 --> 10:44:53,500
We don't need this.

18365
10:44:54,480 --> 10:44:56,540
Where is the wood I was punching?

18366
10:44:56,760 --> 10:44:58,240
Where is the wood?!

18367
10:44:58,740 --> 10:44:59,700
I almost had him.

18368
10:45:00,940 --> 10:45:01,900
Come on, come on, come on!

18369
10:45:03,000 --> 10:45:03,940
I can kill him!

18370
10:45:03,980 --> 10:45:06,520
You were fighting the phantoms on the cliff?

18371
10:45:06,520 --> 10:45:08,500
Yeah, I'm like...

18372
10:45:09,400 --> 10:45:10,440
I'm like...

18373
10:45:10,440 --> 10:45:13,220
In my own epic story time over here, okay?

18374
10:45:14,060 --> 10:45:15,660
He didn't give me one though.

18375
10:45:15,740 --> 10:45:16,720
He didn't give me a membrane.

18376
10:45:19,840 --> 10:45:20,360
Okay.

18377
10:45:21,240 --> 10:45:23,400
You told me to go to the village!

18378
10:45:23,520 --> 10:45:24,560
I'm trying to get there!

18379
10:45:25,060 --> 10:45:27,300
I told you it was on the other side!

18380
10:45:28,060 --> 10:45:30,040
And you said go anyway!

18381
10:45:30,960 --> 10:45:32,720
You said make it!

18382
10:45:34,300 --> 10:45:36,160
It's for your own good.

18383
10:45:36,660 --> 10:45:38,760
It's for your own good.

18384
10:45:39,440 --> 10:45:39,960
It's for your own good.

18385
10:45:39,960 --> 10:45:42,680
I can't see anything in night time.

18386
10:45:43,100 --> 10:45:44,580
Oh my god, please, get on there.

18387
10:45:44,720 --> 10:45:44,780
Okay.

18388
10:45:47,300 --> 10:45:49,120
I'm trying to get to the other side.

18389
10:45:49,540 --> 10:45:50,060
Okay.

18390
10:45:50,580 --> 10:45:52,800
Guys, oh, I don't think this is possible.

18391
10:45:53,140 --> 10:45:54,440
I don't think this is possible.

18392
10:45:54,680 --> 10:45:55,820
Alright, just keep going.

18393
10:45:55,860 --> 10:45:57,500
Just keep going.

18394
10:45:58,420 --> 10:45:59,360
I'm sorry, village!

18395
10:45:59,360 --> 10:45:59,540
Village!

18396
10:46:00,540 --> 10:46:02,320
We'll raid you another time!

18397
10:46:02,820 --> 10:46:04,280
Yeah, I know there's a drowned, you guys.

18398
10:46:04,320 --> 10:46:05,300
I saw it, I saw it.

18399
10:46:06,560 --> 10:46:08,880
Hopefully he doesn't have a trident, or else...

18400
10:46:08,880 --> 10:46:11,360
Well, I'm really...

18401
10:46:13,420 --> 10:46:14,980
Or else I'm doomed.

18402
10:46:16,060 --> 10:46:16,480
Oh my god.

18403
10:46:16,520 --> 10:46:19,120
2,000 left for the X...

18404
10:46:19,120 --> 10:46:21,340
And 2,000 left for 3.

18405
10:46:21,600 --> 10:46:23,840
I can't believe we came from...

18406
10:46:23,840 --> 10:46:25,320
12 ,000 and 10,000.

18407
10:46:25,820 --> 10:46:27,140
I can't...

18408
10:46:27,140 --> 10:46:28,060
I can't...

18409
10:46:28,060 --> 10:46:30,360
I can't believe it.

18410
10:46:30,540 --> 10:46:32,060
I'm pretty far still, though.

18411
10:46:32,100 --> 10:46:33,500
I didn't make much progress.

18412
10:46:33,640 --> 10:46:36,120
I'm at negative 6,800.

18413
10:46:36,820 --> 10:46:38,900
We're at 3,700.

18414
10:46:39,360 --> 10:46:40,440
Where are you?

18415
10:46:40,460 --> 10:46:42,680
Okay, I'm negative 7,500.

18416
10:46:43,080 --> 10:46:44,500
4,200.

18417
10:46:46,880 --> 10:46:48,280
Numbers, what do they mean?

18418
10:46:48,380 --> 10:46:48,840
I know.

18419
10:46:49,200 --> 10:46:51,440
I can't do this anymore.

18420
10:46:51,900 --> 10:46:53,760
Man, we're so close!

18421
10:46:53,760 --> 10:46:56,580
We can't just stop at that moment.

18422
10:46:56,740 --> 10:46:58,240
We're so close.

18423
10:46:58,460 --> 10:46:59,200
I can't.

18424
10:46:59,360 --> 10:47:00,560
I'm not strong enough.

18425
10:47:01,540 --> 10:47:02,720
Yes, you are.

18426
10:47:03,440 --> 10:47:04,740
I'm so tired.

18427
10:47:06,300 --> 10:47:07,260
I'm so tired.

18428
10:47:07,880 --> 10:47:11,020
Why is this becoming a 24-hour stream?

18429
10:47:12,300 --> 10:47:13,300
We're gonna do it.

18430
10:47:13,480 --> 10:47:14,640
We're gonna make it.

18431
10:47:14,700 --> 10:47:16,420
We'll have everything we need.

18432
10:47:16,640 --> 10:47:19,940
By the time we make it back, we'll have everything we need.

18433
10:47:20,020 --> 10:47:22,140
I passed my beta.

18434
10:47:23,760 --> 10:47:26,120
Then you knew what we committed to!

18435
10:47:26,400 --> 10:47:27,780
You should've started it!

18436
10:47:28,320 --> 10:47:29,520
You knew the risk.

18437
10:47:29,520 --> 10:47:31,280
You know I'm PST.

18438
10:47:32,040 --> 10:47:33,420
You knew the risk.

18439
10:47:33,740 --> 10:47:36,480
You could have suggested an earlier time.

18440
10:47:36,860 --> 10:47:39,220
But you suggested so late.

18441
10:47:39,380 --> 10:47:39,760
Why?

18442
10:47:40,780 --> 10:47:43,280
I forgot how late it was.

18443
10:47:43,380 --> 10:47:43,960
I forgot.

18444
10:47:44,180 --> 10:47:45,340
That's not what you want me to say.

18445
10:47:45,400 --> 10:47:45,880
I forgot.

18446
10:47:46,380 --> 10:47:48,120
You could've asked for an earlier time.

18447
10:47:48,500 --> 10:47:50,240
You knew how long it was gonna take in the end.

18448
10:47:50,240 --> 10:47:53,460
You knew this was the sacrifice we're gonna have to make.

18449
10:47:53,820 --> 10:47:55,420
We're almost there.

18450
10:47:55,620 --> 10:47:57,920
We're almost there.

18451
10:47:58,180 --> 10:47:59,260
I'm at the sad file.

18452
10:47:59,600 --> 10:48:01,080
Remember the sad file?

18453
10:48:01,500 --> 10:48:03,540
Do you remember the sad file?

18454
10:48:06,760 --> 10:48:08,260
We can do this.

18455
10:48:08,340 --> 10:48:09,780
I believe in...

18456
10:48:09,780 --> 10:48:10,760
I'm freaking...

18457
10:48:10,760 --> 10:48:13,340
I'm almost there.

18458
10:48:13,560 --> 10:48:15,440
I'm almost there at the original.

18459
10:48:15,900 --> 10:48:17,700
This isn't even the goal!

18460
10:48:17,700 --> 10:48:20,200
And we meet up.

18461
10:48:20,360 --> 10:48:22,800
But we'll have everything we need.

18462
10:48:23,180 --> 10:48:26,420
We'll literally have everything we need.

18463
10:48:26,760 --> 10:48:28,080
When we get there.

18464
10:48:28,680 --> 10:48:30,700
My back hurts so much.

18465
10:48:31,220 --> 10:48:32,180
I found a mesa.

18466
10:48:32,620 --> 10:48:33,860
I found a mesa.

18467
10:48:34,020 --> 10:48:35,180
The original mesa.

18468
10:48:35,840 --> 10:48:36,740
Oh my god.

18469
10:48:36,820 --> 10:48:38,040
We're actually almost there.

18470
10:48:38,120 --> 10:48:41,840
I remembered this area.

18471
10:48:42,340 --> 10:48:43,240
Oh my god.

18472
10:48:43,240 --> 10:48:44,920
We're actually almost there.

18473
10:48:44,920 --> 10:48:46,040
I remember this.

18474
10:48:47,440 --> 10:48:49,440
Redstone is in the mineshaft, right?

18475
10:48:49,980 --> 10:48:50,400
Yeah.

18476
10:48:51,120 --> 10:48:52,080
Okay, it's time.

18477
10:48:52,160 --> 10:48:52,860
I'm going in.

18478
10:48:53,000 --> 10:48:54,840
I'm going into the mesa mineshaft.

18479
10:48:55,220 --> 10:48:56,400
I have another wart.

18480
10:48:58,880 --> 10:49:00,720
I'm in the mesa mineshaft.

18481
10:49:00,800 --> 10:49:03,240
Do stuff while I'm...

18482
10:49:03,240 --> 10:49:04,660
While you're traveling?

18483
10:49:05,660 --> 10:49:05,700
Yeah.

18484
10:49:06,180 --> 10:49:12,580
Oh my god, how many redstone?

18485
10:49:12,580 --> 10:49:13,380
I got redstone.

18486
10:49:13,540 --> 10:49:14,480
How many do we need?

18487
10:49:16,020 --> 10:49:17,620
Oh wait, is it redstone?

18488
10:49:17,740 --> 10:49:20,600
What's the one that makes the potions longer, you guys?

18489
10:49:24,660 --> 10:49:25,660
Oh my god.

18490
10:49:25,860 --> 10:49:27,880
Is it the glowstone or is it the redstone?

18491
10:49:28,140 --> 10:49:30,280
Wait, is it redstone or glowstone?

18492
10:49:31,000 --> 10:49:32,480
Don't say that.

18493
10:49:36,700 --> 10:49:37,140
Redstone?

18494
10:49:37,300 --> 10:49:37,520
Okay.

18495
10:49:38,480 --> 10:49:40,620
Okay, I have a lot of...

18496
10:49:40,620 --> 10:49:42,240
The glowstone does something else.

18497
10:49:47,350 --> 10:49:48,650
Okay, I have...

18498
10:49:49,160 --> 10:49:49,930
I have eight.

18499
10:49:52,970 --> 10:49:54,350
Eight is enough.

18500
10:49:54,450 --> 10:49:55,370
Okay, I'm leaving.

18501
10:49:55,910 --> 10:49:57,130
I'm fucking leaving.

18502
10:49:57,350 --> 10:49:59,670
Then we have...

18503
10:49:59,670 --> 10:50:04,090
Yeah, glowstone is for strength and then redstone makes it last longer, the potions.

18504
10:50:05,150 --> 10:50:05,410
Okay.

18505
10:50:06,310 --> 10:50:07,950
I got eight.

18506
10:50:08,010 --> 10:50:08,550
Eight is enough.

18507
10:50:08,650 --> 10:50:10,050
People are saying eight is enough.

18508
10:50:10,050 --> 10:50:11,990
That's good enough for me.

18509
10:50:12,130 --> 10:50:12,390
Okay.

18510
10:50:13,870 --> 10:50:15,950
I just passed by some jungles.

18511
10:50:20,070 --> 10:50:20,590
Alright.

18512
10:50:23,290 --> 10:50:24,470
I'm almost there.

18513
10:50:24,690 --> 10:50:26,190
I'm actually almost there.

18514
10:50:26,770 --> 10:50:28,210
Oh wait, I'm in the mesa too.

18515
10:50:28,650 --> 10:50:29,610
We're in the mesa?

18516
10:50:29,810 --> 10:50:30,810
Oh that's good!

18517
10:50:31,510 --> 10:50:33,390
Oh my god, I gotta make the bread.

18518
10:50:33,830 --> 10:50:35,230
Almost forgot to make the bread.

18519
10:50:37,010 --> 10:50:37,530
Hey.

18520
10:50:38,310 --> 10:50:38,890
Bread.

18521
10:50:39,930 --> 10:50:40,610
I think that's mesa.

18522
10:50:41,150 --> 10:50:42,010
Isn't that?

18523
10:50:42,510 --> 10:50:42,970
Guys?

18524
10:50:44,430 --> 10:50:45,550
I'm in the desert kinda.

18525
10:50:45,790 --> 10:50:45,870
Bread.

18526
10:50:46,910 --> 10:50:48,470
How come I can't make bread?

18527
10:50:49,250 --> 10:50:49,990
What do you mean?

18528
10:50:50,210 --> 10:50:52,050
Why you not let me make bread?

18529
10:50:52,330 --> 10:50:55,310
Turn the hay bales into actual hay.

18530
10:50:56,230 --> 10:50:56,490
Okay.

18531
10:50:57,070 --> 10:50:57,850
I made bread.

18532
10:50:58,430 --> 10:50:59,990
I didn't make bread.

18533
10:51:00,330 --> 10:51:01,610
I made bread.

18534
10:51:02,090 --> 10:51:04,090
I need to figure out my inventory.

18535
10:51:04,090 --> 10:51:06,910
My inventory is a mess and I'm trying to figure this out.

18536
10:51:06,990 --> 10:51:08,510
I'm gonna eat my last...

18537
10:51:08,510 --> 10:51:10,110
I'm gonna eat my last carrot.

18538
10:51:11,070 --> 10:51:11,790
Not the carrot.

18539
10:51:11,810 --> 10:51:13,090
I'm gonna start eating bread.

18540
10:51:13,670 --> 10:51:15,530
Oh my god, get your carbs in.

18541
10:51:15,970 --> 10:51:17,390
I'm getting my carbs in.

18542
10:51:18,030 --> 10:51:19,590
I'm gonna throw this away.

18543
10:51:19,590 --> 10:51:20,410
Carb diet.

18544
10:51:26,730 --> 10:51:27,210
Okay.

18545
10:51:28,070 --> 10:51:29,130
I'm heading over.

18546
10:51:29,950 --> 10:51:33,370
My 2,954 for the Z.

18547
10:51:33,370 --> 10:51:35,670
And then, negative 6,000.

18548
10:51:35,910 --> 10:51:38,670
Wait, I'm walking the wrong way for X.

18549
10:51:39,110 --> 10:51:39,970
It's not good.

18550
10:51:40,290 --> 10:51:41,370
Alright, and then...

18551
10:51:42,150 --> 10:51:44,050
We're like probably so close to each other.

18552
10:51:44,570 --> 10:51:45,170
Probably is.

18553
10:51:45,210 --> 10:51:47,010
I found the original temple.

18554
10:51:47,750 --> 10:51:48,310
Oh, shit.

18555
10:51:49,370 --> 10:51:52,390
Oh my god, we've been playing that same map for...

18556
10:51:52,390 --> 10:51:54,410
The temple just exploded.

18557
10:51:54,610 --> 10:51:55,270
Like, how?

18558
10:51:55,610 --> 10:51:55,850
What?

18559
10:51:58,530 --> 10:51:59,390
Wait, what?

18560
10:51:59,890 --> 10:52:03,070
The temple exploded next to me.

18561
10:52:03,990 --> 10:52:06,150
I wonder if something spawned in it.

18562
10:52:06,290 --> 10:52:07,630
And then it pressed the button.

18563
10:52:07,890 --> 10:52:07,910
What?

18564
10:52:08,890 --> 10:52:11,270
Oh, the chunks loaded in.

18565
10:52:11,730 --> 10:52:12,730
And it exploded?

18566
10:52:13,770 --> 10:52:14,630
Loaded in.

18567
10:52:15,890 --> 10:52:17,530
Holy shit, that was freaky.

18568
10:52:17,650 --> 10:52:18,810
That was actually freaky.

18569
10:52:19,470 --> 10:52:21,450
I think Herobrine is on this server.

18570
10:52:22,970 --> 10:52:25,070
Oh my god, how did that happen?

18571
10:52:26,070 --> 10:52:27,030
Is that a peepee tower?

18572
10:52:27,210 --> 10:52:27,890
No, just kidding.

18573
10:52:28,450 --> 10:52:30,070
I didn't make any peepee towers here.

18574
10:52:30,070 --> 10:52:31,670
I made a peepee tower near the city.

18575
10:52:31,870 --> 10:52:33,750
That's the first village we went to.

18576
10:52:33,870 --> 10:52:34,470
Oh no, wait.

18577
10:52:34,990 --> 10:52:36,290
Nevermind, I have to get around this.

18578
10:52:37,350 --> 10:52:38,150
I'll go this way.

18579
10:52:38,890 --> 10:52:39,730
I'll go this way.

18580
10:52:39,930 --> 10:52:40,910
It's just a little bit.

18581
10:52:43,030 --> 10:52:44,350
Armadillo, so cute.

18582
10:52:44,470 --> 10:52:45,570
I see the armadillos.

18583
10:52:45,910 --> 10:52:48,070
Man, I wish I had my three dogs that...

18584
10:52:49,030 --> 10:52:50,610
Oh, could've used that, yeah.

18585
10:52:50,790 --> 10:52:51,570
What happened to them?

18586
10:52:52,250 --> 10:52:53,070
I don't know.

18587
10:52:53,710 --> 10:52:55,770
I guess I just didn't take my meds.

18588
10:52:56,190 --> 10:52:57,490
I guess that's it.

18589
10:52:57,490 --> 10:52:59,490
Oh, I found the original...

18590
10:53:01,090 --> 10:53:01,690
The...

18591
10:53:01,690 --> 10:53:03,270
The nether...

18592
10:53:03,270 --> 10:53:05,130
The nether gate.

18593
10:53:05,490 --> 10:53:06,890
Not that gate, but the other one.

18594
10:53:06,910 --> 10:53:08,190
The very first one we ever found.

18595
10:53:08,750 --> 10:53:13,190
Are you sure you're not confusing this with another server that we were on?

18596
10:53:13,750 --> 10:53:14,310
No.

18597
10:53:14,530 --> 10:53:15,890
I know what I saw.

18598
10:53:16,250 --> 10:53:18,610
I know exactly what I saw.

18599
10:53:19,110 --> 10:53:20,970
Okay, I'll believe you.

18600
10:53:21,770 --> 10:53:23,650
I don't know anything anymore.

18601
10:53:23,950 --> 10:53:25,030
I'm just still asleep.

18602
10:53:26,030 --> 10:53:27,810
I know what I want.

18603
10:53:28,090 --> 10:53:29,270
I want to rest my eyes.

18604
10:53:29,750 --> 10:53:32,990
Mint, I bet you we're gonna beat the ender dragon within two hours.

18605
10:53:33,310 --> 10:53:34,210
Oh my god.

18606
10:53:35,550 --> 10:53:36,690
Within two hours.

18607
10:53:36,710 --> 10:53:38,370
The sun will be rising.

18608
10:53:39,370 --> 10:53:41,810
Mint, within two hours, it's gonna be...

18609
10:53:41,810 --> 10:53:42,690
Mint, trust me.

18610
10:53:42,950 --> 10:53:44,990
Within two hours, it's gonna...

18611
10:53:44,990 --> 10:53:45,930
We're gonna make it.

18612
10:53:46,250 --> 10:53:47,510
It's just...

18613
10:53:47,510 --> 10:53:51,070
We just get all the materials we need and we're there.

18614
10:53:51,390 --> 10:53:51,890
We're there.

18615
10:53:51,890 --> 10:53:55,070
If we don't make it, if it's not two hours, what do you owe me?

18616
10:53:55,150 --> 10:53:55,890
What are you gonna give me?

18617
10:53:56,430 --> 10:53:58,090
Then it'll be within three hours.

18618
10:53:58,390 --> 10:54:01,070
My calculations was just a little wrong.

18619
10:54:01,430 --> 10:54:02,610
Just a little bit wrong.

18620
10:54:02,990 --> 10:54:03,770
It was just...

18621
10:54:03,770 --> 10:54:06,510
It'll be within two or three hours.

18622
10:54:06,610 --> 10:54:07,070
How about that?

18623
10:54:07,150 --> 10:54:09,510
Two to three more hours.

18624
10:54:10,430 --> 10:54:11,990
Are you really gonna...

18625
10:54:11,990 --> 10:54:14,350
Are you really not gonna...

18626
10:54:14,870 --> 10:54:15,310
Mint...

18627
10:54:15,310 --> 10:54:17,570
What if we die in the ender dragon?

18628
10:54:17,890 --> 10:54:18,830
Don't say that!

18629
10:54:18,830 --> 10:54:20,030
We're gonna be so...

18630
10:54:20,030 --> 10:54:21,930
We're gonna make sure...

18631
10:54:21,930 --> 10:54:24,790
We're gonna be really stacked up.

18632
10:54:25,070 --> 10:54:26,790
We're gonna be so...

18633
10:54:26,790 --> 10:54:27,730
Stacked up.

18634
10:54:28,050 --> 10:54:29,950
What do I need to do to make arrows again?

18635
10:54:30,070 --> 10:54:31,410
I have 15 feathers.

18636
10:54:32,830 --> 10:54:34,410
Oh, you need flint also.

18637
10:54:35,150 --> 10:54:35,770
You have flint?

18638
10:54:36,190 --> 10:54:38,410
No, you gotta get that in the... What's it called?

18639
10:54:40,010 --> 10:54:40,910
In the...

18640
10:54:40,910 --> 10:54:41,830
In the mines.

18641
10:54:42,410 --> 10:54:43,370
In the gravel.

18642
10:54:43,630 --> 10:54:46,690
Oh my god, we're gonna have to take away all those gravel?

18643
10:54:47,330 --> 10:54:49,390
No, but we would have to mine...

18644
10:54:49,390 --> 10:54:51,130
We would have to place those gravels...

18645
10:54:51,130 --> 10:54:51,950
And then dig them.

18646
10:54:51,990 --> 10:54:52,850
It would be torture.

18647
10:54:53,250 --> 10:54:54,230
Just find some water.

18648
10:54:54,410 --> 10:54:55,230
Just find some water.

18649
10:54:59,210 --> 10:55:00,470
Remember when we...

18650
10:55:00,470 --> 10:55:02,590
We had all this gravel?

18651
10:55:03,030 --> 10:55:03,370
Yeah.

18652
10:55:04,010 --> 10:55:06,110
I had so much gravel.

18653
10:55:06,210 --> 10:55:06,950
What were we gonna do?

18654
10:55:07,050 --> 10:55:08,490
Just take stacks and stacks...

18655
10:55:08,490 --> 10:55:09,590
And stacks of gravel?

18656
10:55:10,670 --> 10:55:11,110
Yeah.

18657
10:55:11,750 --> 10:55:14,130
Yeah, that's what we were gonna do.

18658
10:55:14,130 --> 10:55:16,050
Oh yeah, what else were we gonna do?

18659
10:55:18,790 --> 10:55:20,350
Just trade from the...

18660
10:55:20,350 --> 10:55:22,570
How do we get a Fletcher villager?

18661
10:55:22,770 --> 10:55:23,130
How?

18662
10:55:23,490 --> 10:55:25,290
I have a Fletcher villager.

18663
10:55:25,630 --> 10:55:27,330
I'm at a village right now.

18664
10:55:27,730 --> 10:55:30,290
Oh my god, trade some fucking arrows right now.

18665
10:55:30,750 --> 10:55:32,030
Hold on, let me see.

18666
10:55:32,210 --> 10:55:34,210
Wait, the Fletcher is the map guy, right?

18667
10:55:36,370 --> 10:55:37,450
I don't fucking know.

18668
10:55:38,290 --> 10:55:39,570
I was just reading my chat.

18669
10:55:40,850 --> 10:55:42,250
The Fletching table.

18670
10:55:42,990 --> 10:55:43,390
No?

18671
10:55:43,630 --> 10:55:44,890
What's the Fletching table?

18672
10:55:45,530 --> 10:55:46,690
I don't fucking know.

18673
10:55:47,870 --> 10:55:49,830
Oh, I know what it looks like.

18674
10:55:49,970 --> 10:55:50,830
What's this guy do?

18675
10:55:50,930 --> 10:55:51,350
What do you do?

18676
10:55:51,430 --> 10:55:51,930
What do you have?

18677
10:55:52,330 --> 10:55:53,270
Oh, you have...

18678
10:55:53,270 --> 10:55:54,450
Oh, you're a cartographer.

18679
10:55:55,630 --> 10:55:57,590
Yeah, that's the guy that makes maps.

18680
10:55:57,950 --> 10:56:00,010
I'm starting to get a headache, man.

18681
10:56:00,610 --> 10:56:02,150
Why are there two cartographers?

18682
10:56:02,270 --> 10:56:03,210
Okay, I'm leaving this village.

18683
10:56:03,230 --> 10:56:03,670
It sucks.

18684
10:56:03,930 --> 10:56:05,810
You can make a Fletcher thing.

18685
10:56:05,890 --> 10:56:07,290
You can make a Fletcher thing.

18686
10:56:07,570 --> 10:56:08,490
What do I need?

18687
10:56:08,490 --> 10:56:09,650
I don't know.

18688
10:56:10,050 --> 10:56:10,730
What do they need?

18689
10:56:11,630 --> 10:56:13,130
I need to become a Fletcher.

18690
10:56:13,910 --> 10:56:15,090
What do they need?

18691
10:56:15,550 --> 10:56:18,690
Hold on, I'm putting down the crafting table.

18692
10:56:19,830 --> 10:56:22,410
Oh my god, I'm actually almost there for real this time.

18693
10:56:22,930 --> 10:56:23,790
Oh, I need Flint!

18694
10:56:24,190 --> 10:56:25,010
I need Flint!

18695
10:56:27,530 --> 10:56:29,370
We always need Flint.

18696
10:56:30,390 --> 10:56:32,130
No, but, man, I'm actually there.

18697
10:56:32,230 --> 10:56:34,490
I'm actually, like, legitimately there.

18698
10:56:35,770 --> 10:56:36,810
I'm actually...

18699
10:56:36,810 --> 10:56:38,010
When do we get a middle point?

18700
10:56:38,390 --> 10:56:39,350
I can get all my...

18701
10:56:40,690 --> 10:56:41,730
I'm almost...

18702
10:56:41,730 --> 10:56:44,190
I'm only a thousand away on each side.

18703
10:56:45,050 --> 10:56:45,190
Okay.

18704
10:56:45,610 --> 10:56:48,050
So we're both very, very close.

18705
10:56:48,250 --> 10:56:48,410
Yeah.

18706
10:56:50,790 --> 10:56:52,990
What's the plan when we get there?

18707
10:56:53,950 --> 10:56:55,550
What do we need to make first?

18708
10:56:56,290 --> 10:56:56,810
Sleep.

18709
10:56:58,230 --> 10:56:59,610
What do we need to make first?

18710
10:56:59,870 --> 10:57:02,470
I think we should make the potions first.

18711
10:57:02,950 --> 10:57:04,930
Because I have all the stuff for the potions.

18712
10:57:05,910 --> 10:57:06,310
Sure.

18713
10:57:06,530 --> 10:57:07,870
There's a village to my right?

18714
10:57:08,710 --> 10:57:09,950
Oh, there is.

18715
10:57:10,990 --> 10:57:12,950
How did you wish that?

18716
10:57:14,690 --> 10:57:16,090
Wait, we can sleep now, right?

18717
10:57:16,130 --> 10:57:17,430
We don't need the phantoms, right?

18718
10:57:17,810 --> 10:57:18,870
Oh, true, true, true.

18719
10:57:19,690 --> 10:57:20,070
Okay.

18720
10:57:21,030 --> 10:57:23,910
Even if we need it, we'll just stay up again.

18721
10:57:23,990 --> 10:57:24,530
Let's just sleep.

18722
10:57:25,770 --> 10:57:27,390
Alright, we're very good at that.

18723
10:57:28,770 --> 10:57:29,570
Alright, I'm sleeping.

18724
10:57:33,310 --> 10:57:34,830
Please sleep, oh my god.

18725
10:57:35,670 --> 10:57:35,990
Okay.

18726
10:57:36,610 --> 10:57:38,710
Okay, I'm heading to the village next to me.

18727
10:57:38,830 --> 10:57:41,010
To see if there's more stuff I need.

18728
10:57:41,270 --> 10:57:43,350
I'm so tired, I didn't even put the boat in the water.

18729
10:57:43,470 --> 10:57:44,410
I put it on the land.

18730
10:57:44,530 --> 10:57:45,550
I thought it was water.

18731
10:57:46,630 --> 10:57:49,210
This is a village we haven't desecrated yet.

18732
10:57:49,330 --> 10:57:50,770
Oh my god, I'm at another village.

18733
10:57:51,770 --> 10:57:53,570
Wait, that was just one house.

18734
10:57:54,630 --> 10:57:55,590
Oh no, the other village...

18735
10:57:55,590 --> 10:57:56,990
Oh my god, the other houses are over there.

18736
10:57:57,310 --> 10:57:58,670
I was gonna say, how is there one house?

18737
10:57:58,910 --> 10:57:59,930
Wait, are we in the same village?

18738
10:57:59,930 --> 10:58:01,290
No, I don't see your name.

18739
10:58:02,350 --> 10:58:03,370
I don't know.

18740
10:58:04,050 --> 10:58:04,870
No, I don't see...

18741
10:58:04,870 --> 10:58:07,110
We farmed this house.

18742
10:58:07,590 --> 10:58:09,090
But we might have missed some stuff.

18743
10:58:09,510 --> 10:58:11,470
I don't recognize this one.

18744
10:58:11,690 --> 10:58:13,810
Actually, everything looks the same to me anymore.

18745
10:58:13,910 --> 10:58:15,090
They all look the same.

18746
10:58:15,210 --> 10:58:17,330
I don't remember if they opened the door.

18747
10:58:17,570 --> 10:58:20,790
Or if I fucking harvested this house already.

18748
10:58:21,350 --> 10:58:21,870
Oh my god.

18749
10:58:21,870 --> 10:58:23,590
Maybe they just opened these doors.

18750
10:58:23,990 --> 10:58:25,570
No, I definitely haven't been here before.

18751
10:58:25,950 --> 10:58:26,690
No, I haven't been here.

18752
10:58:26,690 --> 10:58:28,030
Wait, there's a brewing stand too.

18753
10:58:28,650 --> 10:58:29,810
Oh, there's raw meat.

18754
10:58:29,950 --> 10:58:30,670
Oh my god.

18755
10:58:31,450 --> 10:58:33,030
Why do you refrigerate that?

18756
10:58:33,790 --> 10:58:36,090
Is there books?

18757
10:58:36,650 --> 10:58:37,650
Who has the books?

18758
10:58:38,110 --> 10:58:40,690
Taking their emeralds because...

18759
10:58:44,610 --> 10:58:46,830
They have emeralds, they have apples.

18760
10:58:47,170 --> 10:58:48,270
We don't need any of those.

18761
10:58:48,370 --> 10:58:51,090
Taking their emeralds in case we need to trade.

18762
10:58:52,530 --> 10:58:53,470
For arrows.

18763
10:58:54,790 --> 10:58:55,750
Oh, books!

18764
10:58:56,030 --> 10:58:56,730
Books, I got books.

18765
10:58:57,010 --> 10:58:58,230
Get them, get them.

18766
10:58:59,570 --> 10:59:00,350
Grabbing hay.

18767
10:59:01,810 --> 10:59:03,210
Checking if there's books here.

18768
10:59:04,670 --> 10:59:07,790
Grab the hay first before I think of anything else.

18769
10:59:08,550 --> 10:59:09,610
Do I need gas tears?

18770
10:59:09,750 --> 10:59:10,490
I don't remember.

18771
10:59:10,670 --> 10:59:11,950
I keep asking if I need gas tears.

18772
10:59:11,990 --> 10:59:14,990
Oh my god, what did I accidentally click?

18773
10:59:16,230 --> 10:59:18,350
What's the potion for gas tears again?

18774
10:59:18,410 --> 10:59:19,070
I can't remember.

18775
10:59:19,070 --> 10:59:19,130
I can't remember.

18776
10:59:20,950 --> 10:59:22,690
What's the gas tear?

18777
10:59:23,730 --> 10:59:24,710
Obsidian can go?

18778
10:59:24,870 --> 10:59:26,490
Yeah, you're right, obsidian can go.

18779
10:59:27,870 --> 10:59:28,550
Oh, regen!

18780
10:59:28,770 --> 10:59:29,990
Yeah, we want the gas tears.

18781
10:59:31,090 --> 10:59:33,750
Okay, I got the gas tear on me then.

18782
10:59:33,910 --> 10:59:34,870
I have one.

18783
10:59:37,790 --> 10:59:39,250
Is this a library?

18784
10:59:39,810 --> 10:59:40,810
What's over here?

18785
10:59:41,390 --> 10:59:41,990
What's here?

18786
10:59:42,710 --> 10:59:43,730
What's over here?

18787
10:59:44,470 --> 10:59:46,410
Oh, it is stonecutter.

18788
10:59:46,410 --> 10:59:49,670
Okay, alright, time to go back to the coordinates.

18789
10:59:51,630 --> 10:59:52,750
There's a chicken.

18790
10:59:53,610 --> 10:59:55,430
Get over here, I need your feather.

18791
10:59:56,250 --> 10:59:58,130
Get over here, I need your feather.

18792
11:00:00,030 --> 11:00:02,170
Big boss, help me please.

18793
11:00:02,350 --> 11:00:03,730
Oh my god, we're so close.

18794
11:00:05,590 --> 11:00:06,790
Solidus, please.

18795
11:00:07,530 --> 11:00:08,590
Solidus, save me.

18796
11:00:08,610 --> 11:00:09,750
We're almost there.

18797
11:00:10,250 --> 11:00:10,850
Solidus.

18798
11:00:13,590 --> 11:00:15,210
We're so close.

18799
11:00:15,210 --> 11:00:17,370
There's so much stuff.

18800
11:00:17,510 --> 11:00:19,070
I can do this.

18801
11:00:19,170 --> 11:00:20,830
I believe in this.

18802
11:00:20,830 --> 11:00:22,570
I believe in this.

18803
11:00:23,050 --> 11:00:24,490
Stay strong.

18804
11:00:24,830 --> 11:00:26,810
We just need to do the three more hours.

18805
11:00:26,990 --> 11:00:28,030
Stay strong.

18806
11:00:28,430 --> 11:00:29,730
I found more books.

18807
11:00:30,110 --> 11:00:31,770
I found a lot more books.

18808
11:00:32,710 --> 11:00:34,190
That's good, that's good, that's good.

18809
11:00:41,740 --> 11:00:43,720
This is a good village, actually.

18810
11:00:48,020 --> 11:00:49,640
Okay, I'm in the jungle.

18811
11:00:56,720 --> 11:00:58,840
Is somebody sleeping?

18812
11:01:03,080 --> 11:01:08,720
Think about how great it's gonna feel when we beat the ender dragon.

18813
11:01:09,860 --> 11:01:13,200
I won't have any reflexes to beat the ender dragon.

18814
11:01:13,960 --> 11:01:15,480
Think about it, Min.

18815
11:01:15,480 --> 11:01:19,640
You're gonna get that last lock-in moment right there.

18816
11:01:20,460 --> 11:01:21,500
Right now.

18817
11:01:22,320 --> 11:01:22,740
Okay, guys.

18818
11:01:22,940 --> 11:01:24,080
What's the chords again?

18819
11:01:26,860 --> 11:01:32,640
What if we get to the end and then do the ender dragon tomorrow?

18820
11:01:33,620 --> 11:01:34,380
Min, Min.

18821
11:01:34,740 --> 11:01:35,980
What if we did that?

18822
11:01:36,800 --> 11:01:38,560
It's gonna feel so good, Min.

18823
11:01:38,620 --> 11:01:40,360
Just think about how good it's gonna feel.

18824
11:01:40,360 --> 11:01:42,280
I'm almost out of food.

18825
11:01:42,660 --> 11:01:44,820
Just kidding, I have food for you.

18826
11:01:45,280 --> 11:01:46,520
How are you out of food?

18827
11:01:46,580 --> 11:01:47,420
There's a village.

18828
11:01:48,840 --> 11:01:50,740
I took a melon.

18829
11:01:50,740 --> 11:01:51,940
I have melon slices.

18830
11:01:52,300 --> 11:01:53,400
Okay, okay, that's good.

18831
11:01:53,640 --> 11:01:54,780
I'm drooling on myself.

18832
11:01:54,920 --> 11:01:55,700
I'm so tired.

18833
11:01:56,100 --> 11:01:56,960
Min, I believe.

18834
11:01:57,700 --> 11:02:00,020
Min, just...

18835
11:02:00,020 --> 11:02:01,140
Final stretch.

18836
11:02:01,740 --> 11:02:02,780
We're almost there.

18837
11:02:03,440 --> 11:02:05,240
We're almost there, Min.

18838
11:02:06,940 --> 11:02:08,780
Min, we're almost there.

18839
11:02:08,780 --> 11:02:09,940
Me too.

18840
11:02:10,040 --> 11:02:12,140
I'm almost too sleepy to end.

18841
11:02:12,960 --> 11:02:14,580
We're almost there, Min.

18842
11:02:14,800 --> 11:02:16,940
Just stay strong.

18843
11:02:17,740 --> 11:02:19,080
Stay strong.

18844
11:02:19,400 --> 11:02:20,020
What's the coordinates?

18845
11:02:20,120 --> 11:02:21,760
The coordinates are...

18846
11:02:21,760 --> 11:02:24,780
My negative 4000...

18847
11:02:26,760 --> 11:02:28,160
I don't even know.

18848
11:02:28,200 --> 11:02:29,700
Negative 4000 something.

18849
11:02:30,420 --> 11:02:34,560
Negative 4116 and 1576.

18850
11:02:35,880 --> 11:02:36,440
Yeah, oh.

18851
11:02:36,440 --> 11:02:37,660
Wait, you're there?

18852
11:02:37,860 --> 11:02:41,000
No, I'm literally like 200 away.

18853
11:02:41,120 --> 11:02:41,400
Okay.

18854
11:02:42,160 --> 11:02:45,600
I'm a little ways, but I'm making my way.

18855
11:02:49,500 --> 11:02:50,100
Okay,

18856
11:03:01,380 --> 11:03:02,500
I am negative 4000.

18857
11:03:04,480 --> 11:03:05,100
Am I going the right way?

18858
11:03:05,100 --> 11:03:05,620
I am, okay.

18859
11:03:06,320 --> 11:03:07,920
Just running through the forest.

18860
11:03:08,100 --> 11:03:09,620
Oh my god, another village.

18861
11:03:10,420 --> 11:03:12,020
How many villages are you finding?

18862
11:03:12,260 --> 11:03:13,760
A lot, apparently.

18863
11:03:15,660 --> 11:03:17,460
You're finding all the villages.

18864
11:03:17,720 --> 11:03:18,860
Where were they before?

18865
11:03:21,440 --> 11:03:22,380
You're right.

18866
11:03:22,800 --> 11:03:24,540
Where were these?

18867
11:03:25,520 --> 11:03:27,680
Where did they come from?

18868
11:03:30,420 --> 11:03:32,420
Where did they come from?

18869
11:03:32,520 --> 11:03:35,400
Where did they come from?

18870
11:03:36,120 --> 11:03:37,540
Oh my god, wait.

18871
11:03:37,920 --> 11:03:39,940
Wait, I'm actually almost there.

18872
11:03:40,080 --> 11:03:40,880
I'm so close.

18873
11:03:43,860 --> 11:03:45,740
What was the Z, guys?

18874
11:03:45,860 --> 11:03:46,740
What was the Z?

18875
11:03:47,600 --> 11:03:48,800
What did I just pick up?

18876
11:03:50,880 --> 11:03:52,980
Did I just pick up another gold chestplate?

18877
11:03:53,060 --> 11:03:55,420
I think this is where you were at just now.

18878
11:03:55,420 --> 11:03:57,620
Oh yeah, you were where I was!

18879
11:03:57,860 --> 11:03:59,360
And you're almost there.

18880
11:03:59,400 --> 11:04:00,220
I'm almost there.

18881
11:04:00,340 --> 11:04:00,960
Okay, I'm leaving.

18882
11:04:01,480 --> 11:04:02,620
You're almost there.

18883
11:04:02,820 --> 11:04:05,160
That's literally my chestplate.

18884
11:04:05,260 --> 11:04:07,060
Yeah, I was like, what the heck?

18885
11:04:07,120 --> 11:04:07,540
You picked it up.

18886
11:04:08,700 --> 11:04:09,960
It's where I left.

18887
11:04:10,460 --> 11:04:12,220
There's nothing there, I already harvested.

18888
11:04:12,680 --> 11:04:13,660
I know, I'm leaving.

18889
11:04:15,020 --> 11:04:17,300
Oh my god, I think I almost just fell in a hole.

18890
11:04:18,120 --> 11:04:18,360
Okay.

18891
11:04:18,600 --> 11:04:19,640
Almost just fell in a hole.

18892
11:04:20,340 --> 11:04:20,740
Alright.

18893
11:04:20,740 --> 11:04:21,220
Alright.

18894
11:04:22,920 --> 11:04:23,080
Okay.

18895
11:04:23,380 --> 11:04:25,180
1,600.

18896
11:04:25,840 --> 11:04:27,340
1,600.

18897
11:04:28,660 --> 11:04:29,940
I found it!

18898
11:04:30,100 --> 11:04:30,780
I found it!

18899
11:04:31,080 --> 11:04:32,720
It's in front of me!

18900
11:04:33,280 --> 11:04:34,360
You did it.

18901
11:04:34,460 --> 11:04:35,160
I did it.

18902
11:04:35,200 --> 11:04:36,880
I found it.

18903
11:04:37,840 --> 11:04:40,220
I traveled so far.

18904
11:04:40,720 --> 11:04:41,760
It's over here.

18905
11:04:42,260 --> 11:04:44,300
I found the PB Town.

18906
11:04:45,000 --> 11:04:46,540
I found her home.

18907
11:04:47,040 --> 11:04:48,780
I actually found it.

18908
11:04:48,780 --> 11:04:50,700
Oh my god, there it is.

18909
11:04:51,040 --> 11:04:52,440
There's the water bucket.

18910
11:04:52,940 --> 11:04:54,260
Okay, I'm gonna...

18911
11:04:54,260 --> 11:04:56,640
What do we need?

18912
11:04:57,840 --> 11:04:59,100
What do we need?

18913
11:04:59,220 --> 11:05:02,600
I'm gonna put the stuff, putting potions stuff here.

18914
11:05:03,140 --> 11:05:05,160
And then, I'm gonna...

18915
11:05:05,160 --> 11:05:06,040
Wait, is there flint?

18916
11:05:06,180 --> 11:05:07,160
We have flint!

18917
11:05:07,560 --> 11:05:09,600
How much arrow per flint?

18918
11:05:10,360 --> 11:05:12,000
I think it's one.

18919
11:05:13,000 --> 11:05:13,820
Okay, arrow.

18920
11:05:14,760 --> 11:05:16,240
Am I going the right way, guys?

18921
11:05:16,240 --> 11:05:18,460
I'm going the right way.

18922
11:05:19,000 --> 11:05:19,840
I'm almost there.

18923
11:05:19,920 --> 11:05:21,640
I'm just a couple hundred away.

18924
11:05:21,820 --> 11:05:23,320
I have 37.

18925
11:05:23,960 --> 11:05:25,060
I have 37 arrows.

18926
11:05:25,200 --> 11:05:28,640
I'm putting the redstone dust.

18927
11:05:29,120 --> 11:05:31,300
I'm putting the redstone dust here.

18928
11:05:31,880 --> 11:05:32,380
And then...

18929
11:05:33,120 --> 11:05:34,420
And then...

18930
11:05:34,420 --> 11:05:36,320
What am I doing still?

18931
11:05:37,280 --> 11:05:38,080
I don't know.

18932
11:05:40,200 --> 11:05:41,500
I don't know.

18933
11:05:42,260 --> 11:05:43,480
I don't know.

18934
11:05:43,480 --> 11:05:44,460
Hi, hi.

18935
11:05:45,080 --> 11:05:46,540
Mint, stay strong.

18936
11:05:46,720 --> 11:05:47,900
Stay strong, Mint.

18937
11:05:48,440 --> 11:05:49,800
Stay strong, Mint.

18938
11:05:50,620 --> 11:05:51,540
Stay, Mint.

18939
11:05:51,680 --> 11:05:53,020
I believe in you.

18940
11:05:54,260 --> 11:05:55,340
Stay strong.

18941
11:05:55,480 --> 11:05:56,420
Stay strong.

18942
11:06:01,380 --> 11:06:02,900
You have the wood.

18943
11:06:03,520 --> 11:06:06,660
I have the wood.

18944
11:06:07,660 --> 11:06:09,040
Oh, I need to go this way.

18945
11:06:09,100 --> 11:06:10,160
I need to get out of the water.

18946
11:06:13,480 --> 11:06:15,020
I need...

18947
11:06:15,020 --> 11:06:16,580
I'm grabbing...

18948
11:06:16,580 --> 11:06:18,040
Where the fuck is the wood?

18949
11:06:18,360 --> 11:06:20,100
Do we have enough wood?

18950
11:06:21,210 --> 11:06:22,160
We're literally...

18951
11:06:22,160 --> 11:06:23,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18952
11:06:24,220 --> 11:06:25,960
I have wood.

18953
11:06:26,440 --> 11:06:27,560
I have wood.

18954
11:06:27,780 --> 11:06:28,560
Don't fall.

18955
11:06:29,900 --> 11:06:31,320
I have wood.

18956
11:06:31,860 --> 11:06:34,720
I'm running.

18957
11:06:35,040 --> 11:06:35,340
I'm running.

18958
11:06:38,020 --> 11:06:39,200
I'm running.

18959
11:06:39,520 --> 11:06:39,880
Okay.

18960
11:06:39,880 --> 11:06:39,920
Okay.

18961
11:06:40,880 --> 11:06:43,080
I have...

18962
11:06:44,380 --> 11:06:45,920
You can do this.

18963
11:06:46,460 --> 11:06:48,000
We're at the finish line.

18964
11:06:48,460 --> 11:06:50,360
We have everything we need.

18965
11:06:50,500 --> 11:06:52,940
We literally have everything we need.

18966
11:06:52,940 --> 11:06:54,620
Did you make arrows already?

18967
11:06:54,860 --> 11:06:55,380
Yeah, yeah.

18968
11:06:55,460 --> 11:06:56,780
I made 37 arrows.

18969
11:06:56,960 --> 11:06:58,180
That is more than enough.

18970
11:06:58,220 --> 11:06:59,200
That's not enough.

18971
11:06:59,860 --> 11:07:02,700
I have 20 spectral arrows.

18972
11:07:03,280 --> 11:07:04,320
That's not enough.

18973
11:07:04,460 --> 11:07:06,300
How is that not enough?

18974
11:07:06,300 --> 11:07:07,880
How do we need more?

18975
11:07:08,540 --> 11:07:12,740
We have to hit the things to be able to kill the dragon.

18976
11:07:12,740 --> 11:07:13,440
I can hit them.

18977
11:07:13,840 --> 11:07:15,600
I can hit it.

18978
11:07:15,760 --> 11:07:18,000
I can hit it.

18979
11:07:18,360 --> 11:07:19,580
It's so easy.

18980
11:07:19,920 --> 11:07:21,460
I'm in a village.

18981
11:07:22,100 --> 11:07:23,640
How are you in a village?

18982
11:07:24,060 --> 11:07:25,580
I can hit it.

18983
11:07:26,020 --> 11:07:27,040
You can?

18984
11:07:27,380 --> 11:07:27,800
Okay.

18985
11:07:28,380 --> 11:07:29,580
I can hit it.

18986
11:07:29,780 --> 11:07:31,040
I've done it before.

18987
11:07:31,300 --> 11:07:32,180
I can hit it.

18988
11:07:32,240 --> 11:07:32,620
Okay.

18989
11:07:32,620 --> 11:07:32,800
I can hit it.

18990
11:07:33,200 --> 11:07:35,140
This is a fancy village.

18991
11:07:35,760 --> 11:07:38,460
I'm gonna go to sleep now in real life.

18992
11:07:39,160 --> 11:07:39,560
No.

18993
11:07:41,500 --> 11:07:43,100
Just make it here.

18994
11:07:43,360 --> 11:07:45,020
Just make it here, Mint.

18995
11:07:45,260 --> 11:07:47,600
Make it to the last destination.

18996
11:07:48,240 --> 11:07:49,540
The last goal.

18997
11:07:51,640 --> 11:07:52,500
I'm dying.

18998
11:07:52,800 --> 11:07:54,140
The guy just took my bed.

18999
11:07:54,140 --> 11:07:54,780
Make it here, Mint.

19000
11:07:55,860 --> 11:07:56,960
Go to sleep.

19001
11:07:56,960 --> 11:07:58,160
Make it to the end.

19002
11:07:58,880 --> 11:07:59,680
Anywhere.

19003
11:08:00,560 --> 11:08:01,320
Gotta sleep.

19004
11:08:05,860 --> 11:08:06,660
Alright.

19005
11:08:07,820 --> 11:08:08,980
Let's see.

19006
11:08:10,960 --> 11:08:13,240
I refreshed that person.

19007
11:08:14,860 --> 11:08:16,460
By sleeping in their bed.

19008
11:08:17,760 --> 11:08:18,620
Okay, I have 45.

19009
11:08:18,860 --> 11:08:20,860
I have 45 arrows now.

19010
11:08:22,780 --> 11:08:23,740
Oh my god.

19011
11:08:24,560 --> 11:08:26,220
How do I make bed?

19012
11:08:26,220 --> 11:08:26,680
Okay.

19013
11:08:27,860 --> 11:08:28,260
Bed.

19014
11:08:29,180 --> 11:08:29,640
Bed.

19015
11:08:31,340 --> 11:08:32,600
That's fine.

19016
11:08:32,860 --> 11:08:34,600
That's enough beds, I think.

19017
11:08:36,100 --> 11:08:39,100
I can make one more bed for attacking.

19018
11:08:39,420 --> 11:08:42,320
Why are there so many damn cartographers, man?

19019
11:08:45,840 --> 11:08:47,440
And then...

19020
11:08:47,440 --> 11:08:48,300
Let's see.

19021
11:08:48,920 --> 11:08:50,440
I don't need bone.

19022
11:08:51,040 --> 11:08:52,780
We don't need coal.

19023
11:08:54,680 --> 11:08:56,360
We don't need gold.

19024
11:08:57,300 --> 11:08:59,800
What's a potion for strong hits, everybody?

19025
11:09:00,080 --> 11:09:03,700
So we can get some strong hits on the dragon when he comes down.

19026
11:09:04,400 --> 11:09:05,500
What do we need for that?

19027
11:09:06,500 --> 11:09:09,360
What's a strong hit potion that we could get?

19028
11:09:10,160 --> 11:09:10,840
Where's my...

19029
11:09:10,840 --> 11:09:12,880
Okay, we have 11 enders.

19030
11:09:13,920 --> 11:09:14,780
We have...

19031
11:09:14,780 --> 11:09:16,480
That's a strong potion, you guys.

19032
11:09:16,560 --> 11:09:19,620
Okay, I'm putting potion stuff in your chest right now.

19033
11:09:19,700 --> 11:09:21,000
You're the potions person.

19034
11:09:21,000 --> 11:09:23,140
I don't know how potions work.

19035
11:09:23,400 --> 11:09:25,000
I don't know how they work.

19036
11:09:25,220 --> 11:09:25,800
No, don't do it.

19037
11:09:25,840 --> 11:09:26,300
Don't do it.

19038
11:09:26,320 --> 11:09:27,200
Please let me do it.

19039
11:09:27,240 --> 11:09:28,080
Please let me be the one.

19040
11:09:28,280 --> 11:09:30,640
I put all the potion things in your chest.

19041
11:09:30,780 --> 11:09:32,120
You have all the potion stuff.

19042
11:09:32,200 --> 11:09:34,380
You have all the potion stuff.

19043
11:09:34,460 --> 11:09:35,580
I didn't touch anything.

19044
11:09:36,900 --> 11:09:38,160
I found more books.

19045
11:09:38,440 --> 11:09:41,160
I'm giving you 12 books.

19046
11:09:45,020 --> 11:09:45,980
Find obsidian.

19047
11:09:46,260 --> 11:09:49,220
We need to make the enchanting table.

19048
11:09:51,940 --> 11:09:52,420
Enchanting!

19049
11:09:54,020 --> 11:09:55,380
1, 2, 3...

19050
11:09:55,380 --> 11:09:57,200
I'm harvesting this nether portal.

19051
11:09:57,360 --> 11:09:58,540
We don't need it anymore.

19052
11:09:59,260 --> 11:10:00,240
I'm harvesting it.

19053
11:10:00,540 --> 11:10:00,820
Goodbye.

19054
11:10:01,900 --> 11:10:02,980
Goodbye, nether portal.

19055
11:10:03,460 --> 11:10:05,580
We never need you anymore.

19056
11:10:05,740 --> 11:10:07,940
Okay, I'm a couple hundred away.

19057
11:10:08,080 --> 11:10:09,300
I'm on my way.

19058
11:10:10,720 --> 11:10:11,680
Goodbye, nether...

19059
11:10:12,460 --> 11:10:12,940
Goodbye.

19060
11:10:13,760 --> 11:10:15,100
We're never coming back.

19061
11:10:15,440 --> 11:10:16,680
Oh, I have... There's four in the chest.

19062
11:10:16,780 --> 11:10:18,180
Oh, we have four, by the way.

19063
11:10:18,180 --> 11:10:18,920
It's okay.

19064
11:10:19,000 --> 11:10:20,260
I needed to break that anyway.

19065
11:10:20,480 --> 11:10:22,180
We're never coming back here.

19066
11:10:23,520 --> 11:10:26,200
Do you wanna try and do a...

19067
11:10:26,200 --> 11:10:29,300
A pillager raid so we can get a totem of undying?

19068
11:10:30,140 --> 11:10:31,440
Oh, that's a good idea.

19069
11:10:31,740 --> 11:10:33,960
I have an ominous banner.

19070
11:10:34,240 --> 11:10:35,340
How do we get the pillager?

19071
11:10:36,080 --> 11:10:38,380
I think it's the...

19072
11:10:38,380 --> 11:10:40,920
I think it's that potion we got before, right?

19073
11:10:41,100 --> 11:10:41,680
The ominous?

19074
11:10:41,920 --> 11:10:42,320
Yeah.

19075
11:10:43,060 --> 11:10:46,180
The ominous bottle gives you...

19076
11:10:46,180 --> 11:10:46,660
Oh, it's raining.

19077
11:10:46,820 --> 11:10:47,500
That scared me.

19078
11:10:51,560 --> 11:10:52,800
Oh my god, okay.

19079
11:10:54,000 --> 11:10:56,540
I mean, we don't have to get it, but...

19080
11:10:59,360 --> 11:10:59,920
Okay.

19081
11:10:59,920 --> 11:11:00,480
Enchanting...

19082
11:11:00,480 --> 11:11:01,260
I got the table.

19083
11:11:01,860 --> 11:11:03,600
I see the PP tower!

19084
11:11:04,060 --> 11:11:04,840
You see it?

19085
11:11:04,860 --> 11:11:05,620
Where are you?

19086
11:11:05,780 --> 11:11:06,340
I'm on my way!

19087
11:11:06,340 --> 11:11:07,620
I don't see you!

19088
11:11:07,840 --> 11:11:10,280
I just came into light!

19089
11:11:11,720 --> 11:11:12,460
I see you!

19090
11:11:13,200 --> 11:11:14,080
Do you see me?

19091
11:11:14,080 --> 11:11:15,060
I see you too!

19092
11:11:15,180 --> 11:11:15,960
Oh man!

19093
11:11:18,490 --> 11:11:20,310
We made it!

19094
11:11:20,990 --> 11:11:23,530
We have everything we need!

19095
11:11:23,930 --> 11:11:24,950
We have everything!

19096
11:11:25,110 --> 11:11:26,310
I brought you the enchant.

19097
11:11:26,670 --> 11:11:28,210
We have everything!

19098
11:11:28,690 --> 11:11:30,830
We're so close!

19099
11:11:30,970 --> 11:11:32,110
We have everything!

19100
11:11:33,470 --> 11:11:34,410
I have fence!

19101
11:11:34,570 --> 11:11:35,790
I have arrows!

19102
11:11:36,350 --> 11:11:38,170
We have all the potion stuff!

19103
11:11:38,350 --> 11:11:39,590
We have red dust!

19104
11:11:41,410 --> 11:11:43,270
Everything we need is right here.

19105
11:11:43,270 --> 11:11:44,850
It's right...

19106
11:11:44,850 --> 11:11:46,190
It's right here!

19107
11:11:46,890 --> 11:11:48,150
It's right here!

19108
11:11:48,230 --> 11:11:48,950
We did it!

19109
11:11:49,350 --> 11:11:51,170
We jumped so far!

19110
11:11:51,650 --> 11:11:52,930
We did it!

19111
11:11:53,410 --> 11:11:54,790
We got everything!

19112
11:11:57,090 --> 11:11:58,890
We have everything!

19113
11:11:59,090 --> 11:12:00,910
Should we make a new stream?

19114
11:12:02,810 --> 11:12:04,370
We should...

19115
11:12:04,370 --> 11:12:06,870
Are we committing to the end?

19116
11:12:08,230 --> 11:12:10,670
I don't know anymore.

19117
11:12:10,670 --> 11:12:12,210
I don't know.

19118
11:12:17,470 --> 11:12:18,670
I don't know.

19119
11:12:18,830 --> 11:12:20,050
This is your choice, Mint.

19120
11:12:20,230 --> 11:12:21,690
You're past your bedtime.

19121
11:12:22,110 --> 11:12:23,730
Like you know I'm a night owl.

19122
11:12:25,770 --> 11:12:28,210
I thought we were going...

19123
11:12:28,810 --> 11:12:29,990
to the end.

19124
11:12:31,310 --> 11:12:32,770
You wanna go to the end?

19125
11:12:33,390 --> 11:12:34,290
I thought so.

19126
11:12:35,230 --> 11:12:36,390
Are we doing it, Mint?

19127
11:12:36,590 --> 11:12:38,510
Are we doing it to the end?

19128
11:12:38,510 --> 11:12:38,810
I'm sorry.

19129
11:12:40,330 --> 11:12:41,890
I hit my second wind.

19130
11:12:42,070 --> 11:12:44,670
Okay, let's make our...

19131
11:12:44,670 --> 11:12:46,870
Let's make our stream.

19132
11:12:49,130 --> 11:12:49,910
Okay.

19133
11:12:50,590 --> 11:12:52,510
Mint, I believe this.

19134
11:12:53,390 --> 11:12:56,210
Okay, let's turn my stream now and make a new one.

19135
11:12:56,590 --> 11:12:58,630
I believe this.

19136
11:12:59,170 --> 11:12:59,490
Okay.

19137
11:13:02,210 --> 11:13:04,770
Fever substance hitting hard for me.

19138
11:13:04,770 --> 11:13:05,430
I believe this.

19139
11:13:06,030 --> 11:13:07,930
It's my favorite song.

19140
11:13:08,590 --> 11:13:11,490
Okay, I'm making my room too.

19141
11:13:12,870 --> 11:13:13,790
I believe it right now.

19142
11:13:13,890 --> 11:13:15,910
Mint, I believe this.

19143
11:13:17,930 --> 11:13:19,110
Oh my god.

19144
11:13:21,250 --> 11:13:22,010
Alright.

19145
11:13:22,750 --> 11:13:24,510
I can't fucking remake.

19146
11:13:24,670 --> 11:13:26,270
I can't use the same settings.

19147
11:13:26,490 --> 11:13:27,530
I have to...

19148
11:13:27,530 --> 11:13:32,150
I have to copy everything over again.

19149
11:13:35,370 --> 11:13:36,670
Oh my god.

19150
11:13:36,730 --> 11:13:37,050
Okay.

19151
11:13:37,630 --> 11:13:44,910
I didn't realize you gotta end your stream to be able to copy it.

19152
11:13:45,010 --> 11:13:47,410
I thought you can copy existing stuff.

19153
11:13:58,410 --> 11:13:59,050
Copying.

19154
11:13:59,470 --> 11:14:01,210
We have one...

19155
11:14:01,670 --> 11:14:03,990
We have one...

19156
11:14:03,990 --> 11:14:06,530
One life to make this happen.

19157
11:14:06,530 --> 11:14:08,570
Oh my god.

19158
11:14:08,570 --> 11:14:09,810
Is it gonna...

19159
11:14:09,810 --> 11:14:10,650
Is it night time?

19160
11:14:11,630 --> 11:14:12,230
I don't know.

19161
11:14:13,310 --> 11:14:14,990
I'm making my room.

19162
11:14:15,190 --> 11:14:17,050
We'll hear the monsters if it is.

19163
11:14:17,550 --> 11:14:18,810
We'll hear the monsters.

19164
11:14:19,510 --> 11:14:20,530
I think we're okay.

19165
11:14:22,970 --> 11:14:25,470
Okay, we're making our waiting rooms, everybody.

19166
11:14:25,990 --> 11:14:26,430
We're doing it.

19167
11:14:26,490 --> 11:14:28,190
We're making our waiting rooms.

19168
11:14:28,870 --> 11:14:30,910
Oh my god, why can't I act you?

19169
11:14:31,030 --> 11:14:32,390
I don't know.

19170
11:14:32,390 --> 11:14:33,870
I won't let you do it.

19171
11:14:33,910 --> 11:14:35,350
It's so stupid.

19172
11:14:35,730 --> 11:14:36,570
I hate that.

19173
11:14:36,950 --> 11:14:39,810
It bugs out sometimes.

19174
11:14:40,290 --> 11:14:41,850
Oh my god, 420 AM.

19175
11:14:42,670 --> 11:14:44,050
Okay, I'm just...

19176
11:14:44,050 --> 11:14:47,730
I'm not even gonna change the tags or anything.

19177
11:14:48,350 --> 11:14:50,550
I'm not even gonna change the tags.

19178
11:14:50,790 --> 11:14:52,650
I'm just gonna put...

19179
11:14:52,650 --> 11:14:53,490
I'm gonna put...

19180
11:14:53,490 --> 11:14:56,110
Okay guys, we're gonna raid into my next stream.

19181
11:14:56,110 --> 11:15:00,330
Alright guys, I'm raiding to my next stream as well.

19182
11:15:00,330 --> 11:15:01,690
We'll see you.

19183
11:15:01,790 --> 11:15:04,730
We'll see you in the second room.

19184
11:15:04,950 --> 11:15:06,630
See you in the second room.

19185
11:15:08,030 --> 11:15:08,950
Bye bye.

19186
11:15:09,990 --> 11:15:13,030
I didn't even finish making my room yet.

19187
11:15:14,310 --> 11:15:15,550
Bye bye.

19188
11:15:16,510 --> 11:15:17,910
Yeah, okay, bye bye.

19189
11:15:18,550 --> 11:15:20,250
You got the bye bye in?

19190
11:15:20,330 --> 11:15:21,090
I haven't yet.

19191
11:15:21,290 --> 11:15:22,510
I'm ending stream.

19192
11:15:23,030 --> 11:15:23,350
Bye bye.

19193
11:15:25,230 --> 11:15:27,150
Okay, I'm making my waiting room.

19194
11:15:27,150 --> 11:15:30,010
I'm making my waiting room so my thing is...
