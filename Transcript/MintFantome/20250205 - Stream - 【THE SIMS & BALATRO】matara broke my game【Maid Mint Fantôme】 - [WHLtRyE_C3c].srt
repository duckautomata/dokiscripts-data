1
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,110
Oh!

2
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,570
Is there...

3
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,250
Welcome back, Master!

4
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:22,830
Master!

5
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:24,870
Hello!

6
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,870
Oh no, where did my jazzy music go?

7
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,230
That's a little disappointing.

8
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,610
It was so... it felt like I was at a doctor's office.

9
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,370
I was kind of vibing to it.

10
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,050
Welcome, everybody, to The Sims!

11
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,390
Sorry, I had some... I had like a milk tea.

12
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,670
And it made my throat all...

13
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,550
So sorry.

14
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,550
My throat's a little bad today.

15
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,170
Or rather, my cough is bad today.

16
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,030
So sorry if I cough a lot.

17
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,150
This is the nostalgia music?

18
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:08,710
Really?

19
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,010
Let's see.

20
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,030
I...

21
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,990
I think I played The Sims 2 the most.

22
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,750
I would say.

23
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,650
Coughing baby.

24
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,170
Coughing baby!

25
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,810
I think I played The Sims 2 the most.

26
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,250
I had The Sims 1.

27
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,070
But my sister's friends kept stealing it.

28
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,510
So...

29
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,750
I only never got to play it very much.

30
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,070
So I'm very excited...

31
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,550
to play it today.

32
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,430
Now you found a version they can't steal.

33
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,270
Yeah!

34
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,290
Exactly!

35
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,390
So... oh my gosh.

36
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,690
I... I thought that this game would be more nostalgic for me.

37
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,270
Since I did play it a little bit.

38
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,550
But I was like, I don't think I recognize any of this music.

39
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,170
I think I really am so nostalgic for The Sims 2.

40
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,690
But that makes me want to try this even more then.

41
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,550
I only played The Sims 1, 2 and 3.

42
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,290
Are we on The Sims 5?

43
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,570
How many Sims are there now of the mainline series?

44
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,670
Eight!

45
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,370
Four!

46
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,090
Four!

47
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,590
Okay.

48
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,670
Literally one guide.

49
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,350
Literally one guide.

50
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,490
I'm so sorry I haven't been around since recovering from surgery.

51
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,230
I refuse to engage with MGS4.

52
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,030
Trust me, the series gets a lot cleaner if you ignore 4 and 5.

53
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,290
What are you...

54
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,890
What?

55
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,610
No!

56
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,950
MGS4 is great!

57
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,270
What?

58
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,730
No, yeah, no MGS4 slander here.

59
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,610
Wrong guy to tell that to.

60
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,230
I know!

61
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,030
Who do you think you're talking to?

62
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,270
Good morning, Minto.

63
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,250
Good morning, Minto!

64
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,150
But also, get better soon.

65
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,490
Disarray?

66
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,350
Thanks very much!

67
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,470
If you plan on playing older PC games in the future, I suggest looking at the PC gaming wiki.

68
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,850
Contains a bunch of fixes and tweaks to help old games run better on modern hardware.

69
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,390
I did not know that.

70
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,220
So glad you played The Simpsons 1.

71
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,940
The Simpsons, yes.

72
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,820
But...

73
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,340
Look, it's wanting me to click here.

74
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,880
Oh, learn how to play the game.

75
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,020
No, no, no, no.

76
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,220
What did I just press?

77
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
There's a new cab company in town.

78
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,440
Give them a call on your phone to go downtown.

79
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,820
Magic Town.

80
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,000
Studio Town.

81
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,220
Old Shuttle Town.

82
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,620
Old Town Shuttle.

83
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,320
Swizzle's Day.

84
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,700
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

85
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,900
Feeling down?

86
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,320
Vacation Town.

87
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,780
Help system.

88
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,080
Yeah, we'll keep it active.

89
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,700
Oh my gosh, look!

90
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,540
Wait.

91
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,660
It's a newspaper!

92
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,560
Wait.

93
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,700
I can't delete it.

94
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,820
Oh my goodness, I just realized it went from like...

95
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,540
Okay, hold on.

96
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,880
It went from not widescreen to widescreen.

97
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,100
Okay, hold on.

98
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,160
Hold on.

99
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,060
Hold on.

100
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,940
I have to rearrange everything now.

101
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,080
Okay, hold on.

102
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,840
Okay, widescreen town.

103
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,120
Okay, there we go.

104
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,280
Look at the paper!

105
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,620
We can't delete it though.

106
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,110
This music is so jazzy.

107
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,750
Should we build a home?

108
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,530
How do I activate the cheats?

109
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,310
How do I activate...

110
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,230
Hold on a second.

111
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,110
There we go.

112
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,110
Yes, we should.

113
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,930
Okay, okay, okay.

114
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,930
Slash Rosebud.

115
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,470
No, wait.

116
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,890
Control Shift C.

117
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,810
That sounds right.

118
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,890
Motherlode.

119
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,550
No!

120
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:41,630
No!

121
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,890
What?

122
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,570
Is it too early?

123
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,770
Rosebud?

124
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,510
What's Rosebud?

125
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,330
What happened?

126
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,280
Control Shift C.

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,900
Nothing happened.

128
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,620
Rosebud.

129
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm not getting any richer.

130
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,600
Build.

131
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,080
Where is my money anyway?

132
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,760
Let's zoom out.

133
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,280
Alright, let's make a funky house.

134
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,100
Oh, wow.

135
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,820
What is that?

136
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,260
I just bought it.

137
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,600
It was $25, but...

138
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,100
What is this?

139
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,720
Oh, I think this is a fence.

140
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,670
Oh!

141
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,950
What is this then?

142
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,490
How do I... Can I drag and hold?

143
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,790
Oh my gosh!

144
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,590
No.

145
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,110
No, it isn't.

146
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,830
It's just... Brandon!

147
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,510
Brandon!

148
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,510
This is not the time or place.

149
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,440
Anyway.

150
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,700
I wish I could get a description of what these are.

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,200
Fancy!

152
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,380
Wow!

153
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:25,960
Oh my gosh!

154
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,880
Wow, this is so fancy!

155
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,800
There is even barbed wire at the top.

156
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,220
Wait, hold on.

157
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,720
I want us to live on like a hill, right?

158
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,520
How do I demolish?

159
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,460
We are learning.

160
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,580
Hand tool.

161
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,300
Delete.

162
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,570
Nobody will be able to come inside.

163
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,030
Prison core?

164
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,650
No!

165
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,990
Look at the vines!

166
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,950
It's like a secret garden.

167
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,770
It's like a secret garden.

168
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,090
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

169
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,470
We are going to make this like...

170
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,470
I can't build houses in...

171
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,310
In Minecraft, but I think I can do it in The Sims just well.

172
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,290
Oh, they probably need a roof.

173
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,010
No!

174
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,890
They are hippie type.

175
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,510
I like your decor.

176
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,590
Thanks!

177
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,260
Alright.

178
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,620
Whoever is moving in here, they are going to have to...

179
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,260
Okay, this is how you get inside.

180
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,770
You dig a tunnel.

181
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,310
And you crawl underneath.

182
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,210
You can click and hold.

183
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,430
It wouldn't let me.

184
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,810
Hold on.

185
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,610
Maybe I'm not doing it right.

186
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,410
See?

187
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,370
I'm dragging it, but it's not working.

188
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,190
Maybe if I like...

189
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,470
Control?

190
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,130
No.

191
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,390
Alt?

192
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,090
No.

193
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,430
Shift?

194
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,990
No.

195
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,310
I know there's got to be something.

196
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:35,950
Okay.

197
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:36,970
Wait.

198
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,950
The entrance.

199
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,210
You go in from underneath.

200
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,010
I told you it's a secret.

201
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,610
It's a secret entrance.

202
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,190
Secret garden.

203
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,170
Like Bugs Bunny.

204
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,990
I wish I could make it lower.

205
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,790
It's starting to turn into a moat.

206
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,270
And then...

207
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,710
And then...

208
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,670
Here...

209
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,130
Is the outlook point.

210
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,570
Wait.

211
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,890
I can't make a mountain!

212
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,970
What is this?

213
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,750
Nothing has descriptions.

214
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,070
I'm just... I'm blindly digging away.

215
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,510
I don't know what I'm doing.

216
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,890
Is this level?

217
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,430
This looks level.

218
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,150
This looks level, right?

219
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,890
No, it doesn't.

220
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,390
Not anymore.

221
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,250
Altitude is as high as possible.

222
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,090
That's what the tutorials are for.

223
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,650
We don't need...

224
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,850
Okay, let's...

225
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,150
We are in free mode.

226
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,450
We can just figure it out on our own.

227
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,070
We'll make a door right here.

228
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,470
And by door, anybody.

229
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,030
Everybody is welcome.

230
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,050
Hello?

231
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,430
Must be against a wall.

232
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:27,990
No!

233
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,730
This is a wall.

234
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,330
Neighbor be gone privacy fence.

235
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,290
Okay.

236
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,320
Eating...

237
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,880
Eating...

238
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,160
Eating a bug bunny.

239
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,040
Wait, that bug...

240
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,620
Sorry.

241
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,160
Thanks for the five gifted.

242
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,020
What is this one?

243
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,580
I need a description.

244
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,100
The fact 20 column.

245
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,280
Okay, if I click and hold, we can see.

246
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,060
What is this?

247
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,120
The future.

248
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,540
None of these seem like...

249
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,560
Wall and fence tool.

250
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,880
None of these seem like inside house walls.

251
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,360
You know what I'm saying?

252
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,020
How am I supposed to live under these conditions?

253
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,120
These chungus.

254
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,740
That doesn't make any sense.

255
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,620
Logan, thank you for the five gifted.

256
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,180
Don't eyeball me.

257
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,720
Don't eyeball me.

258
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,820
There is only one normal wall?

259
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,880
Oh, you're right.

260
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,320
Okay.

261
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,540
Perfection.

262
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,700
What if we...

263
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
This works.

264
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:23,980
Okay.

265
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,620
Come on in.

266
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,160
We have an open door policy.

267
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,480
What?

268
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,460
Maybe I have to close the wall.

269
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,040
Yes.

270
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,420
Okay.

271
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,640
What other doors we got?

272
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,440
This one is fancier.

273
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,880
The inside will be...

274
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,700
Clown.

275
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,780
Oh my goodness.

276
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,860
Okay.

277
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,520
This one I know we can click and drag.

278
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,180
Oh yeah.

279
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,680
Welcome to...

280
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,420
The zone.

281
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,620
Why is this one all messed up?

282
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,680
Hold on.

283
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,300
We got to fix the terrain everybody.

284
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,180
Is it...

285
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,820
Too high?

286
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,280
Now it's level.

287
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,820
Now it's level.

288
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,980
Now it's level.

289
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,820
This one needs to go up.

290
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,160
I think we're good.

291
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,750
What's this one?

292
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,170
No worries carpet.

293
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,850
It means no worries.

294
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,810
That will be the bathroom.

295
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,670
For the rest of your days.

296
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,790
I guess we have to lift...

297
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,010
Okay.

298
00:17:59,210 --> 00:17:59,990
We have an entrance.

299
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,550
I guess we can...

300
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,970
Why isn't it normal?

301
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,810
Why can't I...

302
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,490
Is my depth perception so bad?

303
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,610
I'm confused.

304
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,650
Carpet in the bathroom?

305
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,170
We got it.

306
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,630
We're in tune with our...

307
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,270
With our...

308
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,930
With the 70s.

309
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,060
This one looks too high.

310
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,040
There we go.

311
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,660
Okay.

312
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,380
Up, up, up.

313
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,640
No, no, down.

314
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,740
No, no, no.

315
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,160
Down.

316
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,320
Up, up.

317
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,940
Gosh, being a contractor is so difficult.

318
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,200
I never knew that.

319
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,640
Hold on.

320
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,500
Can I get rid of some stuff?

321
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,260
We're committed to the bit.

322
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,780
Why isn't it normal?

323
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,180
Look at the width.

324
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,340
I would never think that.

325
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,940
I'm sampling the floors.

326
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,040
I like this.

327
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't lie.

328
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,820
No, I'm not lying.

329
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,380
I'm not.

330
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,860
You're fine just the way you are.

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,960
I can't...

332
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,040
I can't make it taller.

333
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,740
Okay, you know what?

334
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,700
That's just gonna be a little quirk in the design, you know?

335
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,360
Avoid that spot right there.

336
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,140
Avoid that part right there.

337
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,860
Everything else is looking good.

338
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,430
I think we need to build walls.

339
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,950
Can you believe this is exactly how I used to play too?

340
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,210
It's like nothing has changed since when I was a kid.

341
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,770
This looks like my house on Sims Online.

342
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,470
Which was 100% real.

343
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,010
With MMO Sims?

344
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,070
What?

345
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,970
Oh no.

346
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,490
RIP.

347
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,530
I left for like 10 minutes.

348
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,490
Why does this look like an odd prison camp?

349
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,290
What?

350
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,190
Prison where?

351
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,210
What is this one called?

352
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,930
Oh, that's right.

353
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,110
This is the pile of logs.

354
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,970
I like this one.

355
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,970
Simbini's Tribute.

356
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,130
What is this?

357
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,570
Whoa!

358
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,330
I like it.

359
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,890
This can be what separates the bedrooms.

360
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:14,730
Nice.

361
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,850
Alright, we gotta put our...

362
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,990
Alright, we gotta furniture.

363
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,490
We gotta furn...

364
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,420
Oh, I can't put a roof?

365
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,140
Is it because of the steep part right here?

366
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,060
Hold on.

367
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,760
We gotta try and fix this part.

368
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,720
This is slow.

369
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,140
Is it too low?

370
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,920
Why won't it let me modify you?

371
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,980
I don't understand.

372
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,700
I messed up.

373
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,660
Try the 2 second icon.

374
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, the furniture.

375
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,900
Thank you.

376
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,100
In house, out house.

377
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,640
No, we're gonna give them the golden toilet.

378
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,060
In fact, I'm so rich.

379
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,120
They'll have 5 of them.

380
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,200
2...

381
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,740
3...

382
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,140
4...

383
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,060
5.

384
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,940
Okay.

385
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,720
What's this one?

386
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,340
Memorial.

387
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
Okay, nobody touches this one.

388
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,000
But it's a memorial toilet.

389
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,920
Which means it's probably important.

390
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,380
And we should put it behind walls.

391
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,510
How do I...

392
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,330
There we go.

393
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:39,990
Okay.

394
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,110
Like a grave?

395
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,210
Possibly.

396
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,390
It's kind of festive.

397
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,470
It is, right?

398
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,770
My hands and face are all red because of the cold.

399
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,890
Finish replacing multiple trunk lights in my car.

400
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,330
Can I order a warm drink?

401
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,230
Yes.

402
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,450
What would you like?

403
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,210
We have...

404
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,210
You can get...

405
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,870
We're out of everything.

406
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,450
Sorry.

407
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,070
You can make the ground level by using the 2nd tool in the terrain edit.

408
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,390
This?

409
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,910
The 2nd tool.

410
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,390
This one?

411
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,550
Thank you!

412
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,070
Oh my gosh, it worked!

413
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

414
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,730
Now we can put a roof...

415
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,490
Oh my gosh.

416
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,890
Look at that.

417
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,050
Wow.

418
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,090
Wow.

419
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,490
Wow.

420
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:46,790
Wow.

421
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,890
Like the pyramids.

422
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,790
Fun fact, the Sims actually...

423
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,670
Games actually have lore.

424
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,750
And the Sims 3 is a prequel to the Sims 1 chronological...

425
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,470
No way.

426
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,010
Wait, I didn't know it was a prequel.

427
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,590
But I did know that there's like lore.

428
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,230
Like with the Goth family and stuff like that.

429
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,230
Okay, goodbye roof.

430
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,330
I don't want to look at you anymore.

431
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,570
It's so dark in there.

432
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,510
Today just felt like a fever dream, I've been sick the whole day.

433
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,870
No, Doomguy!

434
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,090
Go lay down.

435
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,550
What is this?

436
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,750
Oh, these are stairs.

437
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,570
Wow.

438
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,590
But we could also get...

439
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,730
These are stairs?

440
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,650
How does this work?

441
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,690
Oh, it's a teleporter.

442
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:35,970
Teleporter.

443
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,050
Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

444
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,210
Let's focus on the first floor first.

445
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,670
Lighting.

446
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,550
Every room will have a hula lamp.

447
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,750
The lady lamp.

448
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,650
What's the lady of the house?

449
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,570
Barrel.

450
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,480
She's the light of our life.

451
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,700
It's like a little memorial.

452
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,420
Not memorial.

453
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,000
Can I get something to sleep?

454
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,860
I've been awake for over 24 hours.

455
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,640
Can you tell?

456
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,020
I couldn't tell.

457
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,640
Your MGS4 opinions make it clear.

458
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,560
Why is everybody sick?

459
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,220
Humans are so fragile.

460
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,440
Oh, it's a flamingo.

461
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,200
I thought it was like, you know, a neon lady.

462
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,280
Close enough.

463
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,180
This is our beach-themed bathroom.

464
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,600
Why are the lights on?

465
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,740
No, no, no, no.

466
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,080
No, no, I wanna keep it.

467
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,940
Okay, let's do the kitchen.

468
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,450
Kitchen.

469
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,410
Dining room.

470
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,930
Let's do appliances.

471
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:15,890
What's this?

472
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,430
Oh my gosh, do you never need to have a fridge if you just have a never-ending buffet?

473
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,610
Hot dog, indeed.

474
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,190
I don't know if I played this or Sims 2 when I was a baby.

475
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,010
I played The Sims, but then the Grim Reaper showed up and that terrified me.

476
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,390
Life hacks.

477
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,430
Who's Uncle Roger?

478
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,530
How long until death shows up?

479
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,130
No, I'm gonna keep my guys alive, I promise you.

480
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,810
We're gonna do our best.

481
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,650
They're gonna love this place.

482
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,190
They're gonna love it.

483
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,330
They're gonna love it.

484
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,710
We're gonna have a full family.

485
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,490
Study.

486
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,510
We're gonna give them a computer.

487
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:04,750
Computer!

488
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,130
They're gonna have a computer.

489
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,650
They're gonna have the meet Marco.

490
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,650
Meow meow!

491
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,070
Thanks for the five gifts.

492
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,720
We're gonna have a little moose.

493
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,360
Nice.

494
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,720
Big ol' welcome rug.

495
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,500
No!

496
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,080
Wait, if I give them bear rugs, do you think that freaky bear will come?

497
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,380
I want that bear to show up.

498
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,800
I don't remember her name, but she's a bear that's like...

499
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,920
She like tiptoes in.

500
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,200
I don't know her name.

501
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,420
Can I thank everyone for wishing me well?

502
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,020
Of course.

503
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,400
Be well soon!

504
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,940
I wanna hire you for my house design.

505
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,720
Are you sure?

506
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,720
The red carpet into the bathroom is kind of peak, right?

507
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,960
What the heck is this?

508
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,440
I love having never ending money.

509
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,460
This is kind of great.

510
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
This makes a mess though, doesn't it?

511
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,060
We'll put it in the corner.

512
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,060
What is this?

513
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,460
A shower?

514
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,040
A porta potty.

515
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,340
Oh, you need one of those.

516
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,020
Lampy!

517
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,920
Thanks for the gifted!

518
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,440
What is that?

519
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,200
A garden lamp.

520
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,800
That's perfect, like... This place is kind of romantic, I'm not gonna lie.

521
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,300
Satellite dish.

522
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
Calling aliens.

523
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,780
Jack-o-lantern!

524
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,300
We need like...

525
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,540
Maybe three of these.

526
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,420
No!

527
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
Steve!

528
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,280
Steve!

529
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,160
And this one is a awning.

530
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,000
Oh, that's perfect.

531
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,120
For him.

532
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,260
And...

533
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,980
Oh, a bed!

534
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,200
A bed, a bed, a bed, a bed.

535
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,300
Wait, where's the bed?

536
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,800
That's right, they don't need a kitchen.

537
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,300
They have it.

538
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,060
They have this.

539
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,360
What's a miscellaneous?

540
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:33,960
Electronics.

541
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,240
Oh, they can have a phone!

542
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,700
Yeah, that's important.

543
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,660
Spasmatronic go-go cage.

544
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,310
Dinner and a show?

545
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,430
I remember this thing.

546
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:54,850
This thing...

547
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,410
Gives you a robot, does it not?

548
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,590
This thing gives you a robot that will like do stuff?

549
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,270
Right!

550
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,550
Oh my gosh, I remember that thing.

551
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,350
I remember it.

552
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,480
I think we should have...

553
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,810
Actually, we do need a stove.

554
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,150
A stove.

555
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,430
But not because I want stuff to catch on fire or anything.

556
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,290
That would be ridiculous.

557
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,450
And a horrible thing to think.

558
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,230
I would never.

559
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,670
Currently I'm trying to redecorate my house but I'm unable to decide on a new theme.

560
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,370
Right now I'm between clowns and corn.

561
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,150
They remind me of Myoshi.

562
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,750
But I can't quite seem to pick one.

563
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,750
I love corn!

564
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,420
Is there a perfect family going to be Snake and Otacon with Sunny?

565
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,340
It's the neglected child!

566
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,420
No!

567
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,660
I'm not sick but I did slip and fracture my skull and nose!

568
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,380
I learned that the head bleeds a lot when...

569
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,680
No, Redcrest!

570
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,160
Redcrest!

571
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,020
Oh my gosh, feel better please.

572
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,160
I actually don't know what our family will be.

573
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,140
I haven't really thought about it.

574
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,820
Oh, we have a lot of space over here.

575
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,160
Hold on, we can move a couple things around.

576
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,660
We'll move this over here.

577
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,140
This can still be the living room with our show.

578
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,880
The show can go right there.

579
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,380
They can eat.

580
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,780
Wait, we'll give it a little bit more space.

581
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,000
I don't know who we should make.

582
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,080
I was thinking about making some of you guys though.

583
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,640
I was thinking of just picking out some names.

584
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,300
Mint Doki and Mata?

585
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,240
That is Matara's birthday.

586
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,740
Maybe we can...

587
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,620
What lucky fellow wants to be Matara's husband that she'll probably eat.

588
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,320
We'll see.

589
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,380
I'll figure something out.

590
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,200
We need some more lighting in here.

591
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,640
Not the outside.

592
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,660
Living room?

593
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,940
Oh, I think the lighting was here.

594
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,140
Oh, we've got the wallpaper.

595
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,980
A fireplace.

596
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,300
Romantic.

597
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,020
Wait, what's the difference?

598
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,360
Oh, wow.

599
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,130
We'll get a little pond.

600
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,790
And a pool.

601
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,030
Is that big enough?

602
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,770
Yeah, perfect.

603
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,510
Salt water, fresh water.

604
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,410
Salt water, pool, fresh water, pond.

605
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,390
Kid's fireplace and adult's fireplace.

606
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,120
And everybody...

607
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
Oh my gosh.

608
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,420
Tragic clown painting.

609
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,400
Doesn't this bring a clown or am I crazy?

610
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,880
We need some more decorations.

611
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,320
Oh, house tiger, house tiger.

612
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,100
Maybe like four of these.

613
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,240
Oh!

614
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,480
When the house is warm and the food is hot, the guinea pig cries, forget me not.

615
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,560
Alas, some sims may clean their own, only to forget a guinea pig's home.

616
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,060
Hungry and cold, a pig feels no love, thus breeds contempt for masters above.

617
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:07,140
Expect to play after many a night, who is surprised by the guinea pig bite.

618
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,400
Uncleaned, unloved, a pig's life means naught.

619
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,180
Like a child's plaything, it is simply forgot.

620
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,660
But warnings to all who turn a deaf ear, let the curse of the guinea pig always bring fear.

621
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,500
Didn't I say our bathroom was island themed?

622
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,840
Gotta have a marlin.

623
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,680
Oh, I thought this was JoJo's Bizarre Adventure!

624
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,600
You can kinda see it from like the...

625
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,340
From the small picture, right?

626
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,280
You can kinda see it.

627
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,840
Okay, we got some rugs, we need some plants.

628
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,860
Is this like a hanging plant?

629
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,460
Roses.

630
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,280
Sculptures.

631
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,360
That's ugly.

632
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,730
Do any of these feature undressed women?

633
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,930
Ew, my god!

634
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,930
This one's close enough.

635
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:38,610
They need something to look at when they're, you know, getting ready for bed.

636
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,530
They're like, I wanna be as relaxed as this character.

637
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,140
What else are we missing, guys?

638
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,300
What else are we missing before we get our family to move in here?

639
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Oh, maybe a TV.

640
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,360
What is this?

641
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,460
Wall mounted.

642
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,620
Yeah, they want that.

643
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,860
Hold on.

644
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,410
A sofa, there we go.

645
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,550
No, this one.

646
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,250
Okay.

647
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,010
One window.

648
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,110
Oh, you're right!

649
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,950
Oh my gosh, this place is like a prison with no windows!

650
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,750
That's better.

651
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,200
What does that mean?

652
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,600
Oh my gosh, wow.

653
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,440
How rich

654
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:54,850
are your sims?

655
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,250
Like, crazy, crazy money.

656
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,630
Like, crazy money.

657
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,550
Look, they even have a bush outside.

658
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,090
What's this one?

659
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,150
Tumbleweed.

660
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,070
Oh, this is perfect.

661
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,030
Oh my gosh.

662
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,850
Oh, dang it.

663
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:15,450
Nice!

664
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,030
I wanna live in this clown townhouse.

665
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,890
It's not a clown house!

666
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,320
It's... It's actually...

667
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,930
It's actually really sought after for its...

668
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,230
It's... Think of like, the Hunger Games.

669
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,410
You know?

670
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,890
It's a clown prison.

671
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,170
No, it's not!

672
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,420
Look, what kind of clown prison would have a chandelier?

673
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,660
I think this is actually quite classy.

674
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,620
I would say.

675
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,960
Oh, neon.

676
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,440
Okay!

677
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,520
Do you guys think we have... Are missing anything else?

678
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,680
There's literally two windows!

679
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,720
What are you talking about?

680
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,500
There's no windows.

681
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,460
Arkham Asylum 6 edition.

682
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,680
Wallpaper.

683
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,240
I did!

684
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,080
I put wallpaper!

685
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,120
I put wallpaper.

686
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,800
Fine, you want other wallpaper?

687
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,380
You want a different design?

688
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,940
You want something else?

689
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
How... What was it?

690
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,480
Shift?

691
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,660
Ah, perfect.

692
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,360
There you go!

693
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,860
Oh, a bathtub.

694
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Yeah, they do need to shower.

695
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,040
You're right, you're right.

696
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,060
That's an important thing.

697
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,040
Oh, a refrigerator.

698
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,460
Oh wait, we said a stove.

699
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,840
I forgot to do the stove.

700
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,070
Oh wow, an oven brick stove.

701
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,950
Okay, nice.

702
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:10,850
A dishwasher.

703
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:12,910
There we go.

704
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,430
And we'll give him even a coffee.

705
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,230
Do they need a sink?

706
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,050
Probably.

707
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,450
Probably need a sink.

708
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,770
What's this one?

709
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,350
Really rustic.

710
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,010
No, no.

711
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:30,990
Oh wow!

712
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,570
Oh, they also need to wash their hands in here.

713
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
Too much?

714
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,080
No.

715
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,180
No, no, no.

716
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Let's give him... Oh wait, I did give him a bath!

717
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,500
What's this?

718
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,460
Does this not... Does the love tub not count?

719
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,200
Does that one not suit your taste?

720
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,560
Okay, hello.

721
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,780
Welcome to membership.

722
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,780
Thank you.

723
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,240
Okay, we'll do this one.

724
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,420
Okay.

725
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,240
Okay.

726
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,240
Okay.

727
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,500
Okay, we have toilets, we have showers, we have sinks.

728
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,640
We have entertainment, we have sleep facilities.

729
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,440
We have toys.

730
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,940
We have...

731
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,540
Oxygen bar.

732
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,240
What the hell is that?

733
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,600
What is this?

734
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,060
Aquatic playhouse?

735
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,820
Oh my god!

736
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,450
Do you think I can reach that?

737
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,610
I need this.

738
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,090
What the heck is that?

739
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,490
I need to see that in motion.

740
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,890
Second floor?

741
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,610
Maybe...

742
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,900
My game just crashed.

743
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,190
My game just crashed.

744
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:12,290
No!

745
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,930
No!

746
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,810
Did it save my house?

747
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,410
No, please.

748
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,330
Please, no.

749
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:32,410
Oh!

750
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,430
It hurts!

751
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,340
Make family first?

752
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,960
Okay, we can make a family first.

753
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,980
Wait, how do I leave?

754
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,300
How do I leave?

755
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,160
Oh, let's see.

756
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,160
Go, not quit.

757
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:38,700
Neighborhood.

758
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,720
Don't...

759
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,730
Don't cry me, don't take my money instead.

760
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:53,150
No!

761
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,170
Sims 4 crashed randomly too?

762
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,730
Sims 3 won't.

763
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,650
I actually really only... I didn't like the Sims...

764
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,210
You know what?

765
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,910
I think actually I really didn't like the Sims 4.

766
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,110
But I remember I think I also didn't like the Sims 3.

767
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,730
Freaking house gone, but not forgotten.

768
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,050
Okay, MataraCon.

769
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,050
Let's make Matara...

770
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,890
Oh my god, Matara.

771
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,210
Alright, she's an adult.

772
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,710
What the hell are these options?

773
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,610
Oh my god!

774
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:37,610
Why

775
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,040
does it look like that?

776
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,580
Oh my god.

777
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,100
Oh golly.

778
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,460
Is there... Oh my god.

779
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,780
Is there no customization in this game or...

780
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,900
I can't even change their hair colors or anything?

781
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,520
Nothing?

782
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,940
Oh wow, okay.

783
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,040
We'll just have to go for the closest thing we see.

784
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,850
Hot dog.

785
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,390
Rip freak house.

786
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,610
That nightmare mansion will live on in our hearts.

787
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,150
I was really happy about it!

788
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,030
I'm so sad.

789
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,010
Welcome to the Sims 1.

790
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:35,510
No!

791
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,790
I feel like...

792
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,310
No...

793
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,790
If you guys see one...

794
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,270
Pink hair?

795
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,130
Pink hair?

796
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,330
Okay, this is our first option.

797
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,990
This... No.

798
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,230
This might be our second option.

799
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,510
She's really old.

800
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,540
I'm just looking for pink hair.

801
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,540
Anything with pink hair.

802
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,640
This is also a viable option.

803
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,600
It's like gotcha.

804
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,960
What if I just close my eyes?

805
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,900
These heads don't seem to match the body sometimes.

806
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,300
Okay, I think this is the only one we can choose.

807
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,220
She's the only one with pink hair.

808
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,640
Neat.

809
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,820
Kind of.

810
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,100
Outgoing max stat.

811
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,880
Active... We'll do like half.

812
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,020
Playful max stat.

813
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,400
Nothing else left.

814
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:52,660
Okay.

815
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,260
Bio for Mataracon.

816
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,320
Raiden would have loved that house.

817
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,100
Maybe after taking...

818
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,160
Oh wait, we forgot the body.

819
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,220
Gosh, these are all so sexy.

820
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,070
What the hell are these?

821
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,510
This one I think.

822
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,790
I feel like this one is basically her.

823
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,490
Space bug with no one to love.

824
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,190
She's...

825
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,310
She's making the best of her...

826
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,110
Our life.

827
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:57,470
Sorry.

828
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,290
My brain moves a little strangely.

829
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,910
The best of her life...

830
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,670
On Earth...

831
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:08,610
And...

832
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:11,790
Is desperate to eat...

833
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,910
Another husband.

834
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,070
It could be you!

835
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,110
Okay, done.

836
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,430
Okay.

837
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,330
Alright.

838
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,110
Okay.

839
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,490
I'm gonna close my eyes.

840
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,930
I'm gonna close my eyes...

841
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,490
And you guys say...

842
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:41,750
Say...

843
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,370
Me!

844
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,590
If you want to be...

845
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,570
The name of...

846
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:49,290
If you want to be Matar's husband to eat...

847
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,110
And then I'll create you a really cool...

848
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,910
Cool...

849
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,230
Avatar.

850
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,190
And...

851
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,750
I'm just gonna open my eyes...

852
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,470
And pick the first person I see, okay?

853
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:03,550
So...

854
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:04,650
So...

855
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,090
You know.

856
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:06,710
Just say...

857
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,910
Me!

858
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,150
Me!

859
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,690
What about wives?

860
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,190
Is she interested in eating a wife?

861
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,170
Maybe.

862
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,550
Anybody can join in.

863
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,330
But you're gonna technically be a husband.

864
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,750
Because I don't think...

865
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,890
I don't know if she eats wives.

866
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:22,830
Okay.

867
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:24,090
I'm closing my eyes!

868
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,350
I'll give you a countdown.

869
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,410
From five.

870
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:29,830
Five!

871
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:31,350
Hold on.

872
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:31,990
Four!

873
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,110
Three!

874
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,210
Two!

875
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,310
One!

876
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,770
I saw...

877
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:41,890
Nyanthony!

878
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,410
Nyanthony!

879
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,210
I don't think...

880
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,350
I don't feel like I should entertain this.

881
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,670
But a deal's a deal.

882
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:11,670
Nyanthony!

883
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,150
Where are you?

884
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,950
Where are you, Nyanthony?

885
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,670
Nyanthony, where are you?

886
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:24,010
Nyanthony.

887
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,670
Nyanthony.

888
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,310
Nyanthony.

889
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,030
Nyanthony.

890
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,190
Nyanthony.

891
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,810
How do you feel?

892
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:32,190
How do you feel?

893
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,070
How do you feel?

894
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,750
I can't...

895
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,310
To be...

896
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,710
You guys, I'll even...

897
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,590
Oh, hi!

898
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,690
There you are!

899
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,710
I...

900
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,590
I even...

901
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,210
I put my finger on my monitor.

902
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,510
Like, I pointed to the spot where I was going to look.

903
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:47,430
And...

904
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,000
Fate has such a funny way of working out, huh?

905
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,200
This feels like...

906
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,400
This feels really cruel.

907
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,240
Nyanthony, because you're a cat, I feel like you would be very neat.

908
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,140
You know?

909
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,180
And you'd be quite active and playful.

910
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,080
But not very nice.

911
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,900
And not very outgoing.

912
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,380
More active.

913
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,920
I think that's how you would be.

914
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,260
It's destiny.

915
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:21,480
Destiny.

916
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,460
Cats are neat?

917
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,120
Yes!

918
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,340
They're very neat.

919
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,260
Let's see what we got.

920
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,680
For MP...

921
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,380
For Matara Pregnant.

922
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,160
This one is so scary!

923
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,840
I don't like it!

924
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,320
Wow!

925
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,460
What are these?

926
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,880
Why are none of them normal?

927
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,720
Is this some...

928
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,180
The guy from Team Fortress?

929
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,060
Are these...

930
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,060
Are these not Team Fortress guys?

931
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,400
Why are none of them normal?

932
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,490
I can't find just a guy.

933
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,770
Is this really literally all we have?

934
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,430
Why are people like this?

935
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,430
Where is...

936
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,910
Oh my gosh!

937
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:38,610
Matara Pregnant?

938
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,450
What happened to Stop Getting Pregnant?

939
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,850
That's to you guys.

940
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,830
I don't care what Matara does.

941
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:46,930
Thanks for making me smile.

942
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,270
You're pretty good.

943
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,750
Thanks, guys.

944
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,730
Nyanthony is from TF2.

945
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,670
There are skins from Command and Conquer Renegade.

946
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,930
Do I not have skins from regular Joel?

947
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,310
Okay, we're finally at like some normal...

948
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,770
Some normalcy here.

949
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:12,510
Oh my gosh!

950
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,070
Alvis!

951
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,450
That's kind of exciting.

952
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,630
Like celebrity status.

953
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:19,430
Okay.

954
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:23,270
I'm going to close my eyes and I'm just going to click and we'll see what we get, okay?

955
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,750
Five...

956
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,300
Four...

957
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:28,500
Three...

958
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:29,660
Two...

959
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,700
One...

960
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,450
Stop!

961
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:38,910
They match, actually.

962
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,450
Back one?

963
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,730
What?

964
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,090
No.

965
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,450
What did I miss?

966
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,630
Love, Matara.

967
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,750
This one looks like a skin suit.

968
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,270
Like they...

969
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,090
This one maybe matches more.

970
00:52:59,330 --> 00:52:59,870
I don't know.

971
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:04,790
Nyanthony.

972
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:07,010
Nyanthony, Matara...

973
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,410
It's Revolver, Ocelot.

974
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:08,830
No!

975
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:16,990
Nyanthony...

976
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,230
Loves...

977
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,990
Not wearing a shirt.

978
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,310
And also...

979
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:30,210
Not giving a bleep.

980
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,250
Oh gosh.

981
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:36,950
This is so hard to type.

982
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:37,350
Sorry.

983
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,350
Nyanthony...

984
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,990
Is a cool...

985
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,050
Super chill guy.

986
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:53,550
And will also talk for hours about his tattoos.

987
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,050
Is that how you spell tattoo?

988
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,310
Tattoos.

989
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,130
Don't ask about them.

990
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,270
He's a yapper.

991
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,890
That's why they're made for each other.

992
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,950
Does he like Ace Combat 2?

993
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:10,130
May like Ace Combat...

994
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,950
But...

995
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,150
Hasn't tried it yet.

996
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,510
Definitely...

997
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,530
Finger guns.

998
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:37,830
Matara and Nyanthony.

999
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,190
They have a roommate by the way.

1000
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,210
Alright.

1001
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,030
Who wants to be the roommate?

1002
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,190
The roommate might...

1003
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,190
Either third wheel or...

1004
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,530
There could be some drama.

1005
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:54,950
Okay, I'm going to close my eyes.

1006
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,270
I'm going to put my hand on the screen.

1007
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,470
Just like I did before.

1008
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,250
Okay, I'm closing my eyes.

1009
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:00,670
5...

1010
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,910
4...

1011
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:02,990
3...

1012
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,190
2...

1013
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:05,330
1...

1014
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:07,270
I saw it.

1015
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:08,950
G the game.

1016
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,630
G the game.

1017
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:13,750
G the game.

1018
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,490
Okay, you're going to be really freaky if that's what you go by then.

1019
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,790
Okay, G the game.

1020
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:19,930
Let's see.

1021
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,770
G the game.

1022
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,470
This guy kind of sucks.

1023
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,390
No, no, I'm just kidding.

1024
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,270
G the game, you're great.

1025
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,890
Very outgoing.

1026
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,750
Super duper active.

1027
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:54,970
No, a little less active but definitely very playful.

1028
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:56,270
And nice.

1029
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,450
Yeah, he's nice.

1030
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,390
The roommate from hell.

1031
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:08,850
G the game.

1032
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:19,410
Is one freak you don't want to mess with.

1033
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:31,310
This guy will always be peeping through windows and listening through walls.

1034
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:33,890
Me!

1035
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,450
Pasta, I'm sorry.

1036
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:39,910
He seems chill.

1037
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:40,790
He is chill.

1038
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:42,950
He be peeping.

1039
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,810
Outgoing and playful with that outfit.

1040
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,810
Lore goes crazy.

1041
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,410
Almost wrote peeing there.

1042
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,510
You saw nothing.

1043
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,710
My brain works faster than my fingers.

1044
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,450
He hates Ace Combat.

1045
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,730
No, he's playful.

1046
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:18,130
Basically, a real life Volgin.

1047
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,630
Kuwabara, Kuwabara.

1048
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,550
Sounds like the beginning of one of your raunchy books.

1049
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,890
If that were the case.

1050
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,010
And also a billionaire.

1051
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:48,070
Who owns a super successful company and is the CEO.

1052
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:53,650
Perfect, perfect.

1053
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:55,690
Oh my gosh.

1054
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,110
We're finished creating our family.

1055
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,170
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

1056
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:04,450
Okay, but we have to...

1057
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,410
You guys, we have to...

1058
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,730
Are those the Goths?

1059
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,820
Wait, this is a park.

1060
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,720
I thought it was a house.

1061
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,640
I was gonna be like, that's a nice place to move them into.

1062
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:21,880
Save?

1063
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:22,880
How do I save?

1064
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,760
I don't think I can save in this mode, right?

1065
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,640
I think you can only save when...

1066
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,340
Save the family.

1067
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:32,880
What do you mean?

1068
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,280
I think they're saved.

1069
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,720
I think I have to choose a house to save.

1070
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,800
Congrats to the lucky guy.

1071
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,640
I thought you were going to lay down, Brandon.

1072
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,400
Yeah, I think you save after they move in, but we have to rebuild.

1073
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,960
I'm sad.

1074
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,460
Choose house, save Rosebud, choose new house.

1075
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,420
Maybe we...

1076
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,980
Maybe we can...

1077
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,960
Maybe this is their forever home.

1078
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,960
We can add on to it, right?

1079
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,320
We can add on to it.

1080
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,720
I can do this.

1081
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,740
I'm a construction worker.

1082
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,920
Get rid of all these nasty trees first.

1083
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,240
It's just missing something.

1084
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,200
Like a garden wall, okay?

1085
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,800
Hear me out.

1086
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,340
I think this is really nice looking.

1087
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,140
I think it just...

1088
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,860
Adds like...

1089
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,700
Like, it looks so nice, actually.

1090
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,840
I ignore the barbed wire.

1091
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,740
Because it just kind of looks like it's like a garden.

1092
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,460
This place is too small!

1093
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:15,380
Okay, hold on.

1094
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,220
I realized I forgot to expand the household.

1095
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,880
Okay.

1096
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,780
This is how it's going to work, okay?

1097
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,120
This is how it's going to work.

1098
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:27,700
Wait.

1099
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,760
Can I demolish the wall?

1100
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,180
There is a tool for that and I don't remember what it is.

1101
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,320
Click and drag.

1102
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,920
Shift to...

1103
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,860
Control click and drag.

1104
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:44,980
Okay.

1105
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,440
There we go.

1106
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,900
Alright, so basically they have to go through the microwave hallway.

1107
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:52,820
Okay.

1108
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,480
They have to go through the microwave hallway to get to the second portion of the house.

1109
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,110
Oops.

1110
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,050
There we go.

1111
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:11,870
Okay.

1112
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:14,750
It's just a really long hallway.

1113
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,570
And then it opens up.

1114
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,210
Huge.

1115
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:24,670
Huge...

1116
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:25,050
Area.

1117
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,270
Ginormous area.

1118
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,570
Like that.

1119
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:33,530
Yeah!

1120
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,170
And then this is the secret garden.

1121
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,150
That I talked about before.

1122
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,010
Sorry, I still have my cough.

1123
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:52,490
Apparently, you can still have a dry cough for like...

1124
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:58,570
For like a couple weeks after Bunkai-desu.

1125
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,050
Secret garden!

1126
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:01,150
Garden!

1127
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:05,330
Let's get the walls down for a second.

1128
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:05,610
Okay.

1129
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,530
New home, new me.

1130
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,910
Meandering mossy stone.

1131
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,770
Actually, I said microwave hallway.

1132
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,350
It's more like a zen hallway.

1133
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,830
You know?

1134
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,050
Please save.

1135
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:25,910
Oh my gosh!

1136
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,290
I just started!

1137
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,170
I'll save.

1138
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:28,910
I'll save.

1139
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:31,810
Tara's house.

1140
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,130
There!

1141
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,610
Okay.

1142
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:40,510
And then we'll add some artwork.

1143
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:52,410
It's just filled with clowns.

1144
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:54,650
Who's this?

1145
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:57,230
Nevermind.

1146
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:59,450
It's filled with ladies.

1147
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,150
Oh my God.

1148
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,930
Do you think it's too dark in here?

1149
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,630
What's this one?

1150
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:11,950
Oh,

1151
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,740
we need our Jojo's painting.

1152
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,700
Jojo Bizarre Adventure.

1153
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,280
Why?

1154
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:23,980
Why is it...

1155
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,280
There we go.

1156
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,180
What's this?

1157
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,020
A replica model.

1158
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,360
Get back the ladies.

1159
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:39,280
They can really just kind of appreciate the human form in this hallway.

1160
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,760
And don't forget our five tigers.

1161
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:49,920
One, two, three, four, five.

1162
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,260
Happy two years to a certain go white girl go gif.

1163
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:09,440
One of only a dozen realist works by Kimi.

1164
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,880
The painting's artist names are pretty funny.

1165
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,640
An unconventional artist, she paints with her tail and unlike most artists of her day, she's a dog.

1166
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,380
This particular piece speaks out against the oppression of dogs worldwide.

1167
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:31,120
Dogs which are forced to endure uncomfortable and even worse, unfashionable restraint devices.

1168
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:41,350
On one side, you see the human.

1169
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:49,030
On the other side, you see the guinea pig at the end of the hallway just staring at you.

1170
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,830
And you see the dog.

1171
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,410
You think...

1172
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,310
You think about your life choices.

1173
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:02,410
One, who controls whom?

1174
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:05,970
The dog or the human?

1175
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,230
Oh yeah, I gotta do wallpaper, you guys.

1176
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:13,490
I'm gonna do the wallpaper we did last time because I really did like this one.

1177
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:14,750
Shift.

1178
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:18,900
Perfect.

1179
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:37,420
There also will be audio of... There will be a speaker blasting something at the end of the hallway.

1180
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,280
Probably like...

1181
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,380
I don't know what it is.

1182
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,280
Probably like some sort of mantra.

1183
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,080
Children laughing?

1184
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,220
Victor, welcome to membership.

1185
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:53,900
Thank you.

1186
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:57,260
You should buy a teddy bear in case the freaky bear visits you.

1187
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,040
There's a chance it will try to have a conversation...

1188
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,720
Really?

1189
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,000
OK.

1190
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,140
I sent that super forever ago.

1191
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,700
I'm sorry, pasta.

1192
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,800
Wait, we need a teddy bear.

1193
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:12,300
This one?

1194
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,100
Or this one.

1195
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,720
We'll do multiple.

1196
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,300
Now the room opens up to the reflection of the man.

1197
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,440
OK.

1198
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,340
We need more...

1199
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,420
What's this?

1200
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:33,760
OK.

1201
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,920
Footsteps.

1202
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,680
Whose footsteps are these?

1203
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,950
And carpet in the middle.

1204
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:47,470
Hello, Minto.

1205
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:48,710
Hello, Artemis.

1206
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:49,830
Save.

1207
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:50,570
Thank you.

1208
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,070
I guess we'll save periodically.

1209
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,150
Did that save?

1210
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:56,970
Did that work?

1211
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:01,410
Why is the audio coming and going?

1212
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:02,210
It's kind of weird.

1213
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:03,730
Dance floor!

1214
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:04,310
Dance floor!

1215
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:11,050
OK, this is going to be a super party fun time room.

1216
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,050
Oh wait, we need a phone.

1217
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,400
What else do they have in here?

1218
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,240
Our buffet, our everything!

1219
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,360
I'm so bummed!

1220
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,780
We lost...

1221
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,020
We lost everything!

1222
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,500
I'm so sad.

1223
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,840
Dr. Hunter infected you with Minto cough.

1224
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:39,360
No!

1225
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,980
We can at least get this back.

1226
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,720
An instant pond.

1227
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,320
Fancy.

1228
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,360
Bubble blower.

1229
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,660
Campfire.

1230
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,800
Extreme campfire.

1231
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,860
This is extreme volleyball.

1232
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,400
Wait, what did I just buy?

1233
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,120
Our toilets, our everything.

1234
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,060
I'm just so sad.

1235
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,040
We lost so much.

1236
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:22,260
OK, but only cool people can go in here.

1237
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,080
Actually, will they be able to get past that?

1238
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,800
A voodoo doll!

1239
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:28,900
OK, hold on.

1240
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:29,960
There's so much here.

1241
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,140
OK, hold on.

1242
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,020
I'm getting ahead of myself.

1243
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,820
We gave them a TV.

1244
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:34,900
A TV?

1245
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,640
Wait, yes.

1246
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,700
We gave them...

1247
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,320
We gave them...

1248
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,440
Where's the voodoo doll?

1249
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,480
Is this a coffin?

1250
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,180
Skeleton closet.

1251
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,820
We gave them...

1252
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,540
I'm getting lost in the sauce!

1253
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,580
Where'd the voodoo doll go?

1254
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,580
I want that.

1255
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,660
Oh, here it is.

1256
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,780
Wait, there we go.

1257
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,160
We'll put it next to the computer.

1258
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,860
I'm forgetting what we gave them.

1259
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,360
Everything.

1260
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,660
Your healing beam helped me get a little better.

1261
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,900
I hope you can have lots of fun fires and disasters.

1262
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:24,220
No!

1263
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,220
No fires, no disasters.

1264
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,040
This is a clean game.

1265
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,260
Thank you for that, Kazupa.

1266
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,620
Please, you just sent one the other day.

1267
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:33,880
Please.

1268
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:39,990
Oh,

1269
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,360
our fireplace.

1270
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,640
We do need that, though.

1271
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,570
I was so excited about...

1272
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,730
I was so excited about our last house.

1273
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,930
You guys, I'm so sad.

1274
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,350
I'm just so sad.

1275
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:05,930
I'm so sad.

1276
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,560
Will they both be able to fit?

1277
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:18,400
They don't need light.

1278
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,440
We don't need light in the bedroom.

1279
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,740
The other...

1280
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,580
The other bed is over here.

1281
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,340
We can still make it island themed, I suppose.

1282
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,240
We can still try.

1283
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,360
It was just so cool before.

1284
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,640
It was just...

1285
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,830
Our hula girl.

1286
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,950
We lost everything.

1287
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,310
They had a TV.

1288
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:02,810
Okay, so we had a TV.

1289
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,170
Wait.

1290
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,550
Yeah, TV and a fireplace.

1291
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:11,290
Where is the fireplace at?

1292
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:13,590
Decorative?

1293
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:16,810
Lighting?

1294
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:18,890
Appliances?

1295
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:22,310
Do they even have a stove?

1296
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:28,760
No.

1297
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,500
Oh my gosh.

1298
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,860
They don't have room.

1299
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:36,260
See, our place was filled to the brim with exciting things.

1300
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:38,700
Fireworks?

1301
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,020
What does that mean?

1302
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,340
Oh, it's in building.

1303
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,040
Thank you guys.

1304
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:52,640
Thank you.

1305
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,960
And they got their...

1306
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,060
Where did they get their couch?

1307
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,240
Nice.

1308
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,840
We'll move David to the next to the TV.

1309
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:11,960
Nice.

1310
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,520
Fancy chair.

1311
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,920
Actually, I don't like that one.

1312
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,000
This one.

1313
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,260
Too close.

1314
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,220
Fireplace's son.

1315
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,680
He can go on the other side.

1316
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,060
What about this one?

1317
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:39,500
Small fireplace.

1318
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,920
Actually, new place.

1319
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,340
New us.

1320
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,020
There is an outdoor fireplace.

1321
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:47,680
Right.

1322
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,600
It's kind of fancy.

1323
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,780
It's kind of nice.

1324
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,040
Oh, the jacuzzi.

1325
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,920
They need the jacuzzi out here.

1326
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,700
The hot tub.

1327
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,440
Of love.

1328
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,120
And screw this thing.

1329
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,580
We're going to give them a dishwasher.

1330
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,300
Wait.

1331
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:13,600
Appliance.

1332
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,800
They get a real dishwasher.

1333
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,360
Save.

1334
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,220
I'm saving.

1335
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm saving.

1336
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,560
What else can be outside?

1337
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,640
In their secret garden.

1338
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,260
It's literally a secret garden.

1339
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,500
It's kind of intense.

1340
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,460
Oh my gosh.

1341
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,220
Maybe a flower.

1342
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,980
A toilet.

1343
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,160
That's disgusting.

1344
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,120
But we can have...

1345
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,820
Hold on.

1346
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,500
We had one before.

1347
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,060
What the heck is this?

1348
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,640
Ejectment?

1349
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,680
What does that mean?

1350
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,580
Hold on.

1351
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,580
There was one that I wanted to put out there.

1352
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,360
It wasn't under here, was it?

1353
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:16,920
No.

1354
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,340
Where did the porta potty go?

1355
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,380
No.

1356
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,300
That's a shower.

1357
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,560
Hmm.

1358
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:31,880
Curious.

1359
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,140
Curious.

1360
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,740
Toilet in front of the other toilet.

1361
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,280
There are double gold toilets, you guys.

1362
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,400
Umbrella table.

1363
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,540
What is this?

1364
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,960
Smart counter?

1365
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,820
Do they not have any more space for anything?

1366
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:56,800
Maybe there.

1367
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:57,940
That should work.

1368
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,180
We can get rid of the trash can probably.

1369
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,520
There we go.

1370
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,380
Oh no!

1371
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:06,900
Hand!

1372
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,540
I need the hand.

1373
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,120
What roof do they have?

1374
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:16,800
No.

1375
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:17,940
I liked...

1376
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,260
What one did I have?

1377
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:20,100
Oh, the pyramids.

1378
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:20,480
That's right.

1379
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,000
We need it super tall.

1380
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,540
You should save.

1381
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,480
I've been saving!

1382
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,040
You guys, ok.

1383
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,200
I've been saving.

1384
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:28,700
It's ok.

1385
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:29,880
It's ok.

1386
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,100
I've been saving.

1387
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:34,720
There we go.

1388
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,120
Alright.

1389
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,400
You don't need to spam it every two seconds.

1390
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:39,800
It's ok.

1391
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:41,940
Taunting artist.

1392
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:42,780
Thank you for the membership.

1393
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,900
Please excuse our PTSD.

1394
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,980
You're excused.

1395
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,720
You're excused.

1396
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,520
I get it.

1397
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,920
I need some art.

1398
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:57,800
Wall art.

1399
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,320
The face of Deku.

1400
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,980
Guys, I can't find the...

1401
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,320
The port potty that we had before.

1402
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:17,820
That's so weird.

1403
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,300
I guess we'll do this one.

1404
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,460
Oh, that's right.

1405
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,340
This is our monument.

1406
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,800
This is like sacred...

1407
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,990
Sacred territory.

1408
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,390
Like that.

1409
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,090
It is an outdoor.

1410
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:45,430
Outdoor.

1411
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,770
Outdoor.

1412
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:51,290
Outdoor.

1413
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:52,330
Is it in here?

1414
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:53,790
Outdoor.

1415
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:54,530
Outdoor.

1416
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:55,210
Outdoor.

1417
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:56,630
Outdoor.

1418
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,330
Plumbing.

1419
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:01,470
Other?

1420
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,750
What the heck is this?

1421
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,790
Personal sta... Oh, I found it.

1422
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:14,150
Will your Sims be able to afford to move in?

1423
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:21,210
Oh, we can move them into a cheap house and then...

1424
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,450
And then we can give them lots of money.

1425
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,630
I'm not gonna cheat the whole way.

1426
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,450
But I do want them to live here.

1427
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,470
I think my game just crashed.

1428
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,480
We're safe.

1429
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,420
What did we miss out?

1430
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,660
We missed out on...

1431
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,900
Actually, let's do the simmer.

1432
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,040
And we need our legacy toilet.

1433
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,680
And we need to put a fence around it.

1434
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,360
Viewing access only.

1435
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,680
Thanks so much for everything.

1436
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:26,140
I appreciate you for bringing so much joy and light to this world.

1437
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,340
My wife and I really enjoyed your playthrough of Mii's Eye.

1438
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,320
Thank you, Brian!

1439
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,740
Oh my gosh.

1440
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,200
Thanks for watching!

1441
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,760
I appreciate it.

1442
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,440
Safe.

1443
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:37,440
OK!

1444
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,140
PTSD justified.

1445
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,480
Yeah, a little bit.

1446
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,380
A little bit, you know.

1447
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,180
Oh my gosh!

1448
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,280
How could I forget a pool?

1449
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,600
OK, get rid of this.

1450
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,680
We need a pool.

1451
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:53,720
We need a pool, everybody.

1452
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,880
We'll put it right here.

1453
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,940
It can be just a little bit of a pool.

1454
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,620
There we go.

1455
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,480
Oh wait.

1456
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,080
Actually...

1457
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:06,620
Undo.

1458
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:08,980
Get rid of this bush.

1459
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,960
And we'll put the entrance right here.

1460
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,140
There we go!

1461
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,360
We're making the most of all the space we have.

1462
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,160
We have... we are literally just...

1463
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,600
killing it with this.

1464
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,460
OK, what else do you think we need?

1465
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,960
What else do you think we need?

1466
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:46,090
I wish I could click and drag this.

1467
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:48,650
Genie lamp?

1468
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:51,790
Is that under magic tricks?

1469
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,620
Hold on, I'm making the outside pretty.

1470
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,160
I'm making the outside pretty.

1471
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,320
There we go.

1472
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,440
Seems one had a recommended reading list.

1473
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,780
Yeah, that's what someone said earlier.

1474
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,820
Oh, windows.

1475
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,540
Yeah, you're right.

1476
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,520
Let's make it bigger.

1477
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:50,340
D

1478
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,520
That should be fine.

1479
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,180
Right there.

1480
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,000
That should be good.

1481
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,640
Oh wait, that's kinda cool.

1482
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,780
You can see into the garden.

1483
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:03,600
Right?

1484
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,300
You can see... wait, hold on.

1485
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,090
You can see into the garden.

1486
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,170
I like it.

1487
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:14,770
I like it.

1488
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:21,310
Kinda sucks compared to our last one, guys.

1489
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,110
I'm so sad.

1490
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,250
And the game just crashed.

1491
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:23,850
Maybe?

1492
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:24,850
Oh, no it didn't.

1493
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:25,330
Oh my gosh.

1494
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:26,990
Oh, genie.

1495
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,490
That's right.

1496
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:28,730
Someone said a genie.

1497
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,910
Is this a genie?

1498
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,350
A newt?

1499
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,050
A magical newt.

1500
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:40,090
A spell book.

1501
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:41,750
Put that in.

1502
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,570
That's why we tell you to save.

1503
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:48,710
I've been saving!

1504
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:50,290
I've been saving!

1505
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,430
What's this?

1506
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,430
Guided to cooking?

1507
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:57,610
The face of Shakespeare?

1508
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,050
I don't see genie.

1509
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,050
I don't see genie.

1510
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,230
We'll put a mirror there.

1511
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:13,930
It's kinda freaky.

1512
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,950
Kinda freaky.

1513
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,170
We need a dining table.

1514
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:21,470
Let's see.

1515
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:21,510
Okay.

1516
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,080
Place to eat.

1517
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:30,740
Oh, dining table.

1518
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:31,080
Here we go.

1519
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:37,900
Okay.

1520
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,960
Okay, okay, okay.

1521
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,200
And some chairs for the...

1522
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,660
For the three of...

1523
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:46,880
Oops.

1524
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,080
Undo?

1525
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:49,280
Undo?

1526
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:49,960
Undo?

1527
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:50,880
Where's the undo?

1528
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:52,980
Where's the undo button?

1529
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,000
Hello?

1530
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:01,750
Oh shoot.

1531
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:02,670
Oh my god.

1532
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:03,890
Undo?

1533
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:07,770
Sorry, you still have a cough.

1534
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,370
It's okay.

1535
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:12,470
It's been a little annoying, but...

1536
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:13,270
I'll do you.

1537
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:13,950
I'll do you.

1538
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,520
Okey dokey.

1539
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,000
Let's see if they can move in.

1540
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,360
Let's see if they can move... Oh wait.

1541
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,100
I probably should get rid of this part.

1542
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,060
I'm afraid...

1543
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:35,220
I'm afraid that they won't be able to walk through.

1544
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:36,380
You know?

1545
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,380
Okay.

1546
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:39,760
Okey dokey.

1547
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,080
What's poppin'?

1548
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:46,600
Cinderatlas!

1549
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,420
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1550
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,520
Thank you!

1551
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,820
Alright, we save.

1552
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,140
We go back to the neighborhood.

1553
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,920
And our family, Matara Khan, moves in...

1554
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,480
Here.

1555
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,420
We can't afford it.

1556
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:00,300
That's fine.

1557
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,900
They move in here.

1558
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,560
They buy this house.

1559
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,600
Okay, and then...

1560
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,120
What is it?

1561
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,000
We give them a lot of money.

1562
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:11,340
How do

1563
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,720
we...

1564
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,240
Wow, he's got a back tattoo!

1565
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,300
Oh my god.

1566
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,900
I forgot I made them...

1567
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,820
I didn't realize I made them both in their underwear.

1568
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,820
Matara, open that package.

1569
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:34,370
What was it?

1570
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:35,750
Control...

1571
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:38,290
Control-Shift-C, right?

1572
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:39,590
Nice.

1573
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:41,310
What?

1574
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:45,610
What did I just do?

1575
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,870
Look up spells.

1576
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:47,550
You know what?

1577
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,270
You...

1578
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:48,930
No, hold on.

1579
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:49,830
How do I change character?

1580
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,450
Here we go.

1581
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:53,430
I told you!

1582
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:55,530
He likes to go through windows!

1583
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:58,290
Squidward Tortellini!

1584
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:02,230
Jump in.

1585
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,570
Matara hates reading.

1586
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,850
Jumping in this hole will save the house in its current condition.

1587
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:13,390
What?

1588
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:13,950
Okay, no.

1589
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:15,170
Wait, hold on.

1590
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,010
Control...

1591
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:18,130
Control-Shift-C.

1592
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:19,790
Rosebud.

1593
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:24,710
Rosebud.

1594
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:26,530
How many times do I have to...

1595
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,030
Oh my gosh, it only gives him a thousand.

1596
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:29,770
Is there more than...

1597
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:31,690
Is there more than the Rosebud?

1598
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:32,330
Pause.

1599
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:36,290
Rosebud.

1600
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:37,390
What does Rosebud do?

1601
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:38,510
Watch our money.

1602
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,290
Oh, semicolon?

1603
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,530
Oh, you can use...

1604
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:45,810
Like this?

1605
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,680
That didn't work.

1606
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:01,810
Did I do it the opposite way?

1607
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,210
Maybe.

1608
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:04,050
Hold on, maybe it's this first.

1609
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:11,680
Oh!

1610
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,280
It worked!

1611
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,320
Control-Shift-C.

1612
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,540
It's so quiet.

1613
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,200
It's so quiet.

1614
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,240
I don't think Motherlode is in this game.

1615
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:26,300
Yeah.

1616
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,240
Um, Rosebud.

1617
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,020
Rosebud.

1618
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:34,080
Semicolon?

1619
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,840
Can I copy and paste?

1620
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,480
Oh, I can, okay.

1621
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,140
Okay, copy.

1622
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,340
Paste.

1623
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:53,600
Nice.

1624
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,040
Control-Shift-C.

1625
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:56,980
Paste.

1626
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:58,020
Nice.

1627
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,000
Control-Shift-C.

1628
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,300
Nice.

1629
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,160
Control-Shift-C.

1630
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:02,120
Nice.

1631
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,140
Control-Shift-C.

1632
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,720
We're gonna give them 200.

1633
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:17,750
Okay.

1634
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:18,810
Nice.

1635
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:19,830
Save.

1636
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:22,090
And, how do I make you move?

1637
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:34,940
Nice.

1638
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,280
That's G the game money.

1639
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,680
Evict and move in again.

1640
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:41,360
Okay.

1641
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,080
Oh!

1642
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,140
My game just crashed.

1643
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:50,330
This is a little painful.

1644
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:52,010
My goodness gracious.

1645
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,090
Also, I'm gonna eat some of my burrito.

1646
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:55,070
I hope you guys don't mind.

1647
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:57,210
I'll be quiet.

1648
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:05,600
Okay.

1649
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,500
Evict.

1650
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,600
Yep.

1651
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:11,140
No.

1652
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,320
Okay.

1653
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,020
They have been evicted.

1654
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,210
Here we go, guys.

1655
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:23,470
Here.

1656
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:24,350
Wait a second.

1657
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,070
Are they not married?

1658
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,210
Or, what's the issue?

1659
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:33,990
Hmm.

1660
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:39,430
Matara is already going to the PC.

1661
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:41,010
What are these guys doing?

1662
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:42,990
He's gonna go use the bathroom.

1663
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:45,970
And this guy is also gonna go...

1664
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:46,330
Uh oh.

1665
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:47,610
They're gonna fight for the PC.

1666
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,430
This guy is already using the bathroom.

1667
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:52,600
Hmm.

1668
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:01,870
They're admiring the hallway.

1669
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:06,050
He's so excited.

1670
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,150
Matara, you have to go faster.

1671
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,980
I wanna see Matara dance.

1672
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,760
And this guy...

1673
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,180
He's gonna kiss her.

1674
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,140
Oh yeah.

1675
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,160
She's dancing with no music.

1676
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,360
Keep dancing, Matara.

1677
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,740
Keep dancing.

1678
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:41,040
I wanna dance with somebody.

1679
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,840
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.

1680
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:46,780
Yeah.

1681
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,300
I wanna dance with somebody.

1682
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,540
With somebody to love me.

1683
01:29:58,590 --> 01:29:59,640
What happened?

1684
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,820
Maybe go knock on that door.

1685
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:10,260
What is this?

1686
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,020
I'm so curious.

1687
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,440
What's in there?

1688
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,000
What the?

1689
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:53,690
They're all entering the tank as a family.

1690
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:55,870
What just happened?

1691
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:02,880
Did we just get a skeleton maid?

1692
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,540
Is this guy gonna flush?

1693
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,100
Oh my god, I knew it.

1694
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:16,860
Flush!

1695
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,640
Alright guys, this is it.

1696
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,120
Bonehilda.

1697
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,860
Oh yeah, I thought it was a CH.

1698
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,660
Oh my gosh!

1699
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,560
Matara, say hi to this too.

1700
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,060
Shake hands.

1701
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,380
Shake hands with Bella.

1702
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,820
Who the hell is whistling?

1703
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:49,720
Oh my god.

1704
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:57,190
What is it?

1705
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:58,010
It's G the game.

1706
01:31:58,350 --> 01:31:58,990
Great.

1707
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:03,550
Rename the maid to Minky?

1708
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:05,130
I don't think you can rename though.

1709
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:09,910
Anthony is living his best aquatic life.

1710
01:32:11,970 --> 01:32:13,490
Who the fuck is whistling?

1711
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:14,450
Shut up!

1712
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,980
Who is whistling?

1713
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,360
The kid?

1714
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:25,940
I don't have a kid.

1715
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:31,160
Mmmmm.

1716
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:33,400
They're Bessies.

1717
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,000
They're Bessies.

1718
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:34,540
They're Bessies.

1719
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,840
We're gonna brag.

1720
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,980
Come on G, the game you gonna be?

1721
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,080
You gotta also compliment this guy.

1722
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,180
Oh, he hates the maid.

1723
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,040
Oh my god, what did she do to you?

1724
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,720
What?

1725
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,400
What?

1726
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,640
Why did she slap him?

1727
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,720
Shake your fist at her.

1728
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,280
What?

1729
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,960
We hate Bella.

1730
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,940
Why are you so pressed about my skeleton maid?

1731
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,900
You say goodbye to her.

1732
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,860
We are...get off my property.

1733
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:48,980
Goodbye.

1734
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,780
Be rubbed?

1735
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:58,740
By who?

1736
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,320
Spork?

1737
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,360
What?

1738
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,960
We have a cat!

1739
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,300
We're like GG.

1740
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,940
No game, sorry.

1741
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:18,640
G the game.

1742
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,060
No!

1743
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,120
The cat loves us.

1744
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,060
Bella sucked.

1745
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:25,460
She was chosen.

1746
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,680
Keep this cat.

1747
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:28,700
Keep the cat.

1748
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,280
Keep the cat.

1749
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,100
Keep the cat.

1750
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,740
I didn't know you could get cats in this game.

1751
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,520
Oh my...

1752
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,200
Oh my...Oh my god, the purr.

1753
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,180
What is Matara up to?

1754
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,540
I'm not quite sure.

1755
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:52,960
She's serving lunch.

1756
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,440
And our game just crashed.

1757
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,020
I think.

1758
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,860
She's serving.

1759
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,120
Guys!

1760
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:12,960
Guys!

1761
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,680
I don't know if anyone else has played the regular Sims, but for people that played the Sims 2...

1762
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,020
Did it crash this much?

1763
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:33,020
Before?

1764
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:33,420
Before!

1765
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:41,980
Yes.

1766
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,980
Yumi's stream had it bad?

1767
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:46,780
No way!

1768
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,360
Oh no!

1769
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:59,440
I didn't even move them in yet.

1770
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,420
OK.

1771
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:04,920
OK.

1772
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:05,000
OK.

1773
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,320
We can redo this.

1774
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,580
We can...

1775
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:12,920
Re-zero!

1776
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,880
Why is this so hard?

1777
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:22,240
OK.

1778
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:22,880
Hold on.

1779
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:25,040
First off, we got to get her with Nyanthony.

1780
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,000
Kiss.

1781
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:29,260
Give the kiss.

1782
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:30,820
Kiss to Nyanthony.

1783
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:48,350
Wait.

1784
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:49,290
Compliment.

1785
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:52,730
Say Nyanthony, I really like your tattoos.

1786
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:02,550
Entertain with a juggle.

1787
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:17,510
What am I hearing?

1788
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:18,330
Something spooky.

1789
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:26,350
This guy is looking up nasty things online, I think.

1790
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,850
Find a job!

1791
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,910
No more playing games!

1792
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:32,610
OK, Matara.

1793
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,790
It's time to use the voodoo doll on Nyanthony.

1794
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:42,850
There's opening an education for playground monitor.

1795
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:46,990
Oh gosh, I don't think G the game should be around children.

1796
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:47,770
Look again!

1797
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:51,490
G the game, it's not the job for you.

1798
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:56,390
Medicine career.

1799
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:58,590
Medical technician.

1800
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:03,110
Take the job.

1801
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:08,980
$200 a day.

1802
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,680
Sorry, simoleons.

1803
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:11,900
Right?

1804
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,020
That's a simoleon.

1805
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,080
Take the job.

1806
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:15,860
Alright.

1807
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,460
Don't sleep in, buddy.

1808
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:18,460
Go, Matara.

1809
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:18,800
Go.

1810
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,260
Go.

1811
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,180
Go wish ill will upon Nyanthony.

1812
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:26,500
Use it.

1813
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,960
Oh,

1814
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:38,930
sorry.

1815
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:39,030
Sorry.

1816
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,280
He's laughing.

1817
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:52,760
He is.

1818
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:53,040
Sorry.

1819
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,540
Every time I close out...

1820
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:01,200
Every time I tab out, it does that thing where it's like...

1821
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,300
I have to not be seen anymore.

1822
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:07,380
OK.

1823
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:08,860
What am I doing?

1824
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,560
I think you were getting stabbed.

1825
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:11,760
Oh my gosh.

1826
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:12,380
Wait, Matara.

1827
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,520
Don't use the toilet.

1828
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,900
Use the steam bath.

1829
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,140
I'm so curious.

1830
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,400
Wait!

1831
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:22,560
What if Nyanthony gets in the hot tub?

1832
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:23,580
Right?

1833
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:26,560
Oh my gosh.

1834
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:26,980
Go away.

1835
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,280
Go away, Nancy.

1836
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,720
Go away, Nancy.

1837
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,220
OK.

1838
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,980
Get in the steam bath.

1839
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:41,660
What is he gonna do?

1840
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,920
He's gonna use the toilet.

1841
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:43,460
That's fine.

1842
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,720
Oh yeah.

1843
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:49,340
Oh yeah.

1844
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,000
Nobody greet this guy.

1845
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:51,720
They all suck.

1846
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:52,500
What the hell?

1847
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:05,200
Nyanthony!

1848
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,380
OK, Matara.

1849
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:11,800
Now you get into the... Join him.

1850
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,280
Join him.

1851
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:15,020
We're shipping them.

1852
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:15,780
We're shipping them.

1853
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:19,280
And then, gee, the game is gonna learn some spells.

1854
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,240
Sorry, I'm gonna be saving every two seconds now, it seems.

1855
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,060
OK, it saved, I think.

1856
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:37,980
Oh my god!

1857
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,780
What happened?

1858
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:47,960
What happened?

1859
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:10,600
I wish he could riz the maid, you know?

1860
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:21,840
OK, they're bonding.

1861
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:22,880
Look, they're bonding.

1862
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,900
They're bonding.

1863
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:25,200
They're bonding.

1864
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:28,040
Uh oh, she has a better relationship with, gee, the game then.

1865
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:30,900
Nyanthony.

1866
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,440
OK, let's buy... What was it?

1867
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,880
The magic wand we need.

1868
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:41,360
Where the hell is that?

1869
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,700
Magical Alakazam.

1870
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,280
Spinning Wheel.

1871
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,080
Spells.

1872
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:00,200
Start this way.

1873
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,060
No original.

1874
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,700
I don't have a wand.

1875
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:05,880
Oh, it comes for free in the package?

1876
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,480
OK, cool.

1877
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:07,980
Wait.

1878
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:08,640
Go back!

1879
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:09,380
Wait!

1880
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:11,940
Not Matara.

1881
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,300
Here.

1882
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:14,920
Nya...G.

1883
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:16,360
G, G, G, G, G.

1884
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,040
Ubajaba?

1885
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:23,380
Ubajaba?

1886
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:37,580
Ubajaba!

1887
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:38,260
Ubajaba!

1888
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:44,740
They are so getting along.

1889
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,660
Oh my gosh, they're almost back up to normal.

1890
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:47,640
Perfect.

1891
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,740
They're bonding over music.

1892
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:55,700
Ubajaba!

1893
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:57,620
Ubajaba!

1894
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,460
Open that up, baby.

1895
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:09,900
Open it up, baby.

1896
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:14,310
Yeah!

1897
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:17,370
Alright.

1898
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:19,490
Where is our... What did we need again?

1899
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:23,070
Add to Inventory.

1900
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:23,850
What the hell is it?

1901
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:24,650
Oh wait!

1902
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:25,290
Add to Inventory.

1903
01:43:25,410 --> 01:43:26,070
Oh, Magic Wand!

1904
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:30,890
Maybe Glorb?

1905
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:31,750
Nice.

1906
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:33,470
Alright, now go back.

1907
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:35,190
To the spell.

1908
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:36,110
OK, look up spells.

1909
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:36,490
OK.

1910
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:37,370
Perfect.

1911
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:40,530
OK, perfect.

1912
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:44,670
Everybody is comfy.

1913
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:46,410
Everybody is happy.

1914
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:48,350
OK, G.

1915
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:48,570
G.

1916
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:51,050
is going to go now.

1917
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:00,470
Oh yes.

1918
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:03,590
Alright, here he goes.

1919
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:04,350
Here he goes.

1920
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:04,970
He's...

1921
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:08,350
OK, Toads.

1922
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:09,410
Oh wow.

1923
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:12,570
Mix these three ingredients to discover the hidden nature of this spell.

1924
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:14,050
What is this?

1925
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:14,950
What are these ingredients?

1926
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:15,750
Oh, beeswax.

1927
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:16,290
Beeswax.

1928
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:16,930
Beeswax.

1929
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:17,970
Honey.

1930
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:19,090
Pixie Dust.

1931
01:44:20,490 --> 01:44:21,030
Oh my gosh.

1932
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:23,350
I thought we were just going to read.

1933
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:26,030
This is actually so intensive.

1934
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:28,350
Snake Venom!

1935
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:29,990
Venom Snake!

1936
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:34,730
I think we have to learn that one.

1937
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:38,630
I think we have to learn this one.

1938
01:44:48,690 --> 01:44:49,970
We don't have anything.

1939
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:53,650
We don't have anything.

1940
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:55,490
OK, go vibrate.

1941
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:59,990
These two are like killing it.

1942
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:00,830
Look at this.

1943
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:02,590
31.

1944
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:05,590
28.

1945
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,930
She doesn't care about Nyanthony as much as Nyanthony.

1946
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:09,910
Nyanthony is falling head over heels though.

1947
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:13,170
It costs money to use the bed?

1948
01:45:14,830 --> 01:45:16,510
Good thing he got a job.

1949
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:19,970
You have to get naked to use the bed?

1950
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:28,500
No way.

1951
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,180
Using the bed crashes the game?

1952
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:51,450
Guys, I don't know if this is playable.

1953
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:55,510
How many hours do I have on this?

1954
01:45:55,770 --> 01:45:56,710
Oh my gosh.

1955
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:59,850
I didn't even look at the reviews.

1956
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:00,810
Let's see.

1957
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:01,310
Store.

1958
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:02,470
The Sims.

1959
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:06,030
The Sims Legacy Collection.

1960
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,910
OK, the reviews are mixed.

1961
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:21,620
Oh my gosh, this person is like... The constant crashes.

1962
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,080
No way.

1963
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,780
I don't want to keep playing.

1964
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,320
Quick pivot to League of Legends.

1965
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,080
You guys.

1966
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:46,110
Welcome to EA Games.

1967
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,490
I'm so sad.

1968
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:51,850
Wait, that's not even a review for The Sims 1.

1969
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:53,630
That's a review for The Sims 2.

1970
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:54,170
Hold on.

1971
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:57,330
The Sims Legacy Collection.

1972
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,430
Mine is also mixed.

1973
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:01,370
Oh my gosh.

1974
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:05,610
I've never rated a product on Steam before, but I will tell you the game is very unstable.

1975
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:06,890
It's hard to play sometimes.

1976
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:12,130
If you are doing very simple play, you might be OK, but if you throw a house party, the game will probably crash.

1977
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:15,850
If the robber comes and steals something, your computer will black screen.

1978
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:18,010
What?

1979
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:19,350
Oh my gosh.

1980
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:23,630
The price is too high and it's not stable.

1981
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:25,690
Small family works fine.

1982
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:27,110
Throw a party, it gets laggy.

1983
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:28,270
Go to town, crash.

1984
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:34,180
May I interest you in Slay the Spire?

1985
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:37,200
Guys, I'm sorry.

1986
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,620
I didn't... I didn't...

1987
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:43,160
I didn't know.

1988
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,600
Time for Simlish Karaoke?

1989
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,400
Can we do that?

1990
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,070
Can we do that?

1991
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:55,550
How do I look up Simlish Karaoke?

1992
01:47:57,130 --> 01:47:58,770
Simlish Karaoke.

1993
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:03,670
Simlish Karaoke.

1994
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:08,450
Simlish Karaoke.

1995
01:49:10,330 --> 01:49:12,130
Simlish Karaoke.

1996
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:37,650
I don't know this song very well.

1997
01:49:42,130 --> 01:50:06,650
I don't know this song very well.

1998
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:11,990
I don't know this song very well.

1999
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:15,830
I don't know this song very well.

2000
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:31,170
I don't know this song very well.

2001
01:50:31,170 --> 01:50:34,490
I don't know this song very well.

2002
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:53,710
I don't know this part.

2003
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:01,250
T-G-I-F...

2004
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:03,130
T-G-I-F...

2005
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:04,470
T-G-I-F...

2006
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:06,790
F-T-G-I-F...

2007
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:08,470
This doesn't sound...

2008
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:11,350
Who's screaming?

2009
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:43,430
I don't know this part.

2010
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:55,850
We are...

2011
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:00,870
The Quib.

2012
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:05,330
Skibidi?

2013
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:06,950
Kinda.

2014
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:08,170
Yay!

2015
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:08,590
Yay!

2016
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:12,950
I don't know what else to do.

2017
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:18,010
I'm sorry, the game kept crashing, you guys!

2018
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:21,810
Quick bellacho run to end on a positive note.

2019
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:25,070
I

2020
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:30,390
don't know what to do.

2021
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:35,850
Sims 4, I didn't buy that one.

2022
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:38,150
Or...

2023
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:39,390
Did I buy that one?

2024
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,410
I don't remember.

2025
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:42,490
Sims...

2026
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:43,530
Oh, I did buy it!

2027
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:44,430
It came with the collection.

2028
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:49,570
Can I recommend you Ghostbusters, a video game remastered on Steam since I heard you love Ghostbusters.

2029
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:53,290
I don't like Ghostbusters.

2030
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:55,390
Oh, it's free.

2031
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:58,910
I have to install it.

2032
01:52:59,010 --> 01:53:01,110
You guys, it's 22 gigs.

2033
01:53:02,730 --> 01:53:05,270
It's 22 gigs, I have to install it.

2034
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:10,270
If you want to come back to Sims 2, there's a source port available.

2035
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:14,890
I don't want to have to look for a bunch of stuff.

2036
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:16,390
It's fine.

2037
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:23,230
Isn't this Sims 4?

2038
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:25,530
I thought I saw that you need...

2039
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:28,050
It's like a subscription thing now to play it, right?

2040
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:29,270
Like it's free, but...

2041
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:31,570
To play is a subscription.

2042
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:33,970
Or to get stuff, I guess.

2043
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:37,610
I'm so bummed.

2044
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:39,650
I wanted to get the bear.

2045
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:41,110
We couldn't even make it tonight.

2046
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:43,670
I'm so bummed right now.

2047
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,190
Don't worry, just Ruby Noob.

2048
01:53:47,410 --> 01:53:49,070
Oh, for packs, yes.

2049
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:51,390
Base game is free, okay.

2050
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:54,990
Lots of DLC though.

2051
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:56,990
DLC are paid, but you can play the full...

2052
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:58,230
Okay, okay, okay.

2053
01:53:59,250 --> 01:53:59,530
I see.

2054
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:00,950
I see.

2055
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:05,590
Maybe Sims 2?

2056
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:06,190
We can try.

2057
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:09,150
I have to install that also.

2058
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:14,990
The Ghostbusters game that came out in mid-2000s is peak.

2059
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:17,530
It's the true GB3.

2060
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:19,790
Let's GB.

2061
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:20,830
Ghostbuster.

2062
01:54:23,290 --> 01:54:24,570
Oh, oh, oh!

2063
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:26,510
This is also a big game.

2064
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:28,410
Okay, I'm downloading it.

2065
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:29,990
It's installing it.

2066
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:35,250
Sims 2 will probably crash a lot too?

2067
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:37,210
Oh no, really?

2068
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,110
Even more?

2069
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:39,350
Oh my gosh, no way.

2070
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:41,430
Oh wait, that's right.

2071
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:42,590
I saw the reviews earlier.

2072
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:43,210
I'm crazy.

2073
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:51,260
Okay.

2074
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:52,560
Pause.

2075
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:53,380
Download.

2076
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:03,700
Pilatro.

2077
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:24,760
Why is it so small?

2078
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:42,310
Without playing a pair.

2079
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:46,170
Nah, let's do a new run.

2080
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:48,070
I don't think I...

2081
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:50,470
Actually, I think I just started this one.

2082
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:51,350
So I'll do a new run.

2083
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:59,030
I saw there were Christmas Simlish songs, but no Santa Nuru.

2084
01:56:02,050 --> 01:56:03,350
You've been playing off stream at all?

2085
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,130
Just a little bit.

2086
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:05,490
Not a lot at all.

2087
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:08,210
Not a lot at all.

2088
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:11,270
Okay.

2089
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:13,750
Okay.

2090
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:15,730
I have to remember how to play actually.

2091
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:18,490
Oh, we can try and get a...

2092
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:18,850
What is it?

2093
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:19,170
A straight?

2094
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:23,030
Sorry, I can't remember what the names are called.

2095
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:23,890
Straight?

2096
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:24,890
Yeah.

2097
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:28,050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, let's...

2098
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:38,250
Oh, good.

2099
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:46,580
I had a flash.

2100
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,820
Wait, is a flash better?

2101
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:48,340
Oh no.

2102
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:49,420
5 cards?

2103
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:50,060
Oh, you're right.

2104
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,880
Wait, 1, 2, 3, 4...

2105
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,940
We can try for that.

2106
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:09,460
Oh, I didn't have a check!

2107
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:12,060
I completely forgot about that, guys!

2108
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:13,200
So I just...

2109
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:15,520
I was like, why didn't I get any points?

2110
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,380
Oh my god.

2111
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:18,540
I messed up already.

2112
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,520
Guys, it's because I'm all flustered about stupid...

2113
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:22,240
Okay, let's restart.

2114
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,760
I'm all flustered about stupid...

2115
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:27,740
Stupid Sims.

2116
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:28,480
I'm sorry.

2117
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:31,820
I'm all...

2118
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:33,300
I'm all...

2119
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,280
I'm all upsety spaghetti.

2120
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,580
Look at Dave the Diver.

2121
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:40,720
Dave the Diver.

2122
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:44,300
No worries, gamer.

2123
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,120
I'm all spaghetti.

2124
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,500
With upsety spaghetti.

2125
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:52,460
What should we try for here?

2126
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:02,710
We can maybe try for the straight here.

2127
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:08,650
2 pair.

2128
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:10,750
We do have 2 pair.

2129
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:12,430
That's true.

2130
01:58:15,650 --> 01:58:18,150
But a straight would be more, right?

2131
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:20,930
30 by 4.

2132
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:23,910
Pair is only 20 by 2.

2133
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:26,410
Goodbye.

2134
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:30,490
Get rid of you.

2135
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:35,990
You can hold R key for fast reset.

2136
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:36,970
Oh, thank you.

2137
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:37,450
I didn't know.

2138
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:38,990
Return of the jonkler.

2139
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:41,350
Fine, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2140
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:45,790
I would need...

2141
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:47,430
I would need...

2142
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:50,350
1, 10, 9, 8, 7...

2143
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:51,830
I would need 10 and a 9.

2144
01:58:51,930 --> 01:58:53,430
So if I did this 2...

2145
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:55,410
If I did these 3...

2146
01:58:55,410 --> 01:58:56,090
Let's try it.

2147
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:58,030
Wow.

2148
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:09,120
I still have my pair.

2149
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:13,240
Ants invaded my room and now I'm covered in ant bites.

2150
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:14,240
Oh my gosh.

2151
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:16,780
I also had ants recently in the maid cafe.

2152
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:19,980
But it's kind of normal since like...

2153
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:21,180
It's abandoned and stuff.

2154
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:25,140
Fine.

2155
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,440
The 2 pair.

2156
01:59:31,490 --> 01:59:31,770
Go!

2157
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:32,850
2 pair!

2158
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,020
Thank you.

2159
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,400
No, I didn't leave food out.

2160
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,960
They started coming from my windows.

2161
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:48,100
But like, I have spiders and...

2162
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,460
You know, cobwebs.

2163
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,280
I just don't know why ants would wanna be in here.

2164
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:54,380
I mean, it's an abandoned maid cafe.

2165
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:56,120
Like...

2166
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:56,920
You know?

2167
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:02,040
2 pair!

2168
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:08,470
This round loves 2 pair.

2169
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:09,070
Yeah.

2170
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:11,570
Hey, we made it, you know?

2171
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:12,770
That's all that matters.

2172
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:16,770
Get my money and go.

2173
02:00:17,170 --> 02:00:17,810
Banana.

2174
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:24,610
Celestial packs always contain the planet card for your most played poker hand.

2175
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:26,550
I don't have enough money.

2176
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:29,410
Plus 15 multiplier.

2177
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:30,050
1 and 6.

2178
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:36,010
Hot dog.

2179
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:38,470
Oh, thanks for the spooky.

2180
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:40,490
Sorry about all the technical issues tonight.

2181
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:42,450
If it makes you feel better, I'm still having a fun time.

2182
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:43,210
Fight on, Minto.

2183
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:44,050
Thanks, Marilyn.

2184
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:45,030
I appreciate it.

2185
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:46,410
I'm sorry, guys.

2186
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:48,230
I did really, really wanna play The Sims.

2187
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:56,300
Banana.

2188
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,540
Okay, we can try a banana.

2189
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,560
And then...

2190
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:05,400
This is a straight, which I tried getting before.

2191
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:12,450
Minto is meant to keep the ants away, though.

2192
02:01:13,170 --> 02:01:14,130
Trouble, right?

2193
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:18,770
Just happy to be here.

2194
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:20,190
Happier here, too.

2195
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:23,830
Let's do a joker card.

2196
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:25,250
We don't know what we want.

2197
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:26,750
What kind of deck we want yet.

2198
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:34,370
Times 3 multiplier of poker hand contains a diamond card.

2199
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:34,890
Club card.

2200
02:01:35,630 --> 02:01:36,510
Oh, what?

2201
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:39,110
Has to be all 4?

2202
02:01:40,830 --> 02:01:44,570
Add $1 of sell value to every joker and consumable card at the end of the round.

2203
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:48,050
Flower bad.

2204
02:01:48,150 --> 02:01:50,090
That's hard to do, I feel.

2205
02:01:50,790 --> 02:01:52,690
EA Games has been broken for 20 plus years.

2206
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:53,310
Not your fault.

2207
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:55,790
I thought it would be different.

2208
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:59,020
I saw so many people playing the ports...

2209
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:01,110
And I didn't see anything bad about it.

2210
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:02,950
So, it's my fault.

2211
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:04,250
Well, I didn't do research, you know.

2212
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:07,030
The present isn't bad.

2213
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:09,350
I mean, we paid for it.

2214
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:10,890
So, I'd like to grab something.

2215
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:14,030
I guess we'll just...

2216
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:15,330
Grab that.

2217
02:02:16,570 --> 02:02:17,330
For now.

2218
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,150
Okay.

2219
02:02:23,370 --> 02:02:24,570
Okey-dokey.

2220
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:28,130
Two pair.

2221
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:28,330
Two pair.

2222
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:37,930
We're happy as we can be...

2223
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:38,690
Just to hang out with you.

2224
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:39,470
Thank you!

2225
02:02:41,070 --> 02:02:41,510
Catch!

2226
02:02:41,550 --> 02:02:42,710
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2227
02:02:42,810 --> 02:02:43,410
Thank you!

2228
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:46,250
Sims 2 is a bit playable than the Sims 1.

2229
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:46,930
Oh, really?

2230
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:50,690
I didn't have it downloaded, though.

2231
02:02:50,770 --> 02:02:51,170
It's okay.

2232
02:02:51,250 --> 02:02:51,870
We're already here.

2233
02:02:55,170 --> 02:02:56,050
Let's see...

2234
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:57,310
We have 3 pair.

2235
02:02:57,670 --> 02:02:58,950
I wish 3 pair was a thing.

2236
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:20,840
Two pair wins with the mold?

2237
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,180
No way, really?

2238
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,240
Let's try it.

2239
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:31,980
It really did.

2240
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:37,440
We didn't even have to do anything.

2241
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:38,700
Craziness.

2242
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:42,480
DNA, my beloved!

2243
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:44,960
It worked!

2244
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,560
It...

2245
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:48,400
This...

2246
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,820
The last try worked so well...

2247
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,960
Until I got to like...

2248
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:54,880
The millions.

2249
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:55,700
It was like...

2250
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:58,040
You need 7 million.

2251
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,880
I couldn't get that high.

2252
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:02,680
DNA is big.

2253
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,420
It does say it's a rare card.

2254
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:09,080
I have enough money.

2255
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:11,660
Bye-bye-bye.

2256
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:13,280
It was busted for a while.

2257
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:14,700
Yeah, it really was.

2258
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:20,070
I want this voucher.

2259
02:04:21,150 --> 02:04:22,650
But we're gonna lose it.

2260
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:24,670
Because it's gonna switch, right?

2261
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:25,910
After we beat the boss.

2262
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:28,630
All club cards are debuffed.

2263
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:47,810
We could duplicate our king.

2264
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:51,110
But...

2265
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,520
No clubbing tonight.

2266
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:02,100
We might be able to...

2267
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:06,140
1, 2, 3...

2268
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:10,420
We might be able...If we can get a jack.

2269
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:13,160
Run from Touhou!

2270
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:16,320
Run from Touhou.

2271
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:17,040
Thank you!

2272
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:19,180
Look at the membership!

2273
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:30,500
Mink!

2274
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,840
Let's try and get a...

2275
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:36,760
What's it called?

2276
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,720
A straight.

2277
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:39,880
I'm obsessed with straights.

2278
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:40,720
I don't know what it is.

2279
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:44,060
Maybe because they just seem feasible to get.

2280
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,540
And they're like in the middle, you know?

2281
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:47,300
Mink!

2282
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:48,660
No!

2283
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:53,260
Come on!

2284
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:54,880
Jack!

2285
02:05:58,830 --> 02:05:59,430
Woah.

2286
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:02,350
That's okay.

2287
02:06:02,650 --> 02:06:03,930
We can do two pair.

2288
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:05,650
Two pair!

2289
02:06:08,110 --> 02:06:08,810
Full house.

2290
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:09,110
Wait.

2291
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:11,190
Wait, what's a full house?

2292
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,570
I forget.

2293
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:12,550
Full house.

2294
02:06:13,410 --> 02:06:14,190
Three of a kind!

2295
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:17,470
Sorry.

2296
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:20,610
We still wanted this.

2297
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:21,810
It's okay.

2298
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:24,370
Cash out.

2299
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:26,750
Cash out or crash out.

2300
02:06:30,130 --> 02:06:33,650
Create a tarot card if hand is played with four dollars or less.

2301
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:37,210
Uncommon jokers give 1.5 multiplier.

2302
02:06:39,550 --> 02:06:40,970
No biggie, still warming up.

2303
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:47,820
Do I have any uncommon?

2304
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:49,880
I only have one uncommon.

2305
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:52,200
And it's not really...

2306
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:55,020
Well, I guess we'd get another multiplier, right?

2307
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:56,200
Cough.

2308
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:05,230
Let's try it.

2309
02:07:05,570 --> 02:07:06,790
I like trying new ones.

2310
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,400
Still don't know what kind of hand I want.

2311
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:14,420
Let's do play.

2312
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:19,680
Maybe if we did something similar to before...

2313
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:23,680
Where we can get like an ace...

2314
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:27,840
Ace heavy...

2315
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,740
An ace heavy deck.

2316
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:31,840
Then we can...

2317
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:36,060
Then we can...

2318
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:39,600
Maybe you guys can help me figure out what I did wrong before.

2319
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:41,180
Maybe.

2320
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:56,420
Hi Mint, am I permitted to ask about cat updates?

2321
02:07:56,660 --> 02:07:57,300
Of course!

2322
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:00,340
My kitties are good!

2323
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,100
I don't think you did anything wrong before.

2324
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:05,900
Oh no, I meant like how I failed off stream.

2325
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:13,100
Like what I should have done to be able to continue using what I had already created.

2326
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:15,220
Minto is my ace.

2327
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:15,900
Minto love.

2328
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:19,060
Things are too much!

2329
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:21,240
Why do you gotta use the yellow hearts?

2330
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:24,500
What?

2331
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:28,140
But yeah, butaro all better.

2332
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:28,800
Yeah.

2333
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:33,880
Paws had some issue with her eye.

2334
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:37,220
But I got some eye cream and now she's all better.

2335
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:43,140
She also had a bit of a cold, but not so...

2336
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:45,860
Seems like she's all better with that too.

2337
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,820
Butaro, he's still stinky.

2338
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:54,440
He's still just a little stinky, terrible guy.

2339
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:55,520
But he's good.

2340
02:08:58,140 --> 02:08:59,540
Does butaro still have the cone?

2341
02:08:59,680 --> 02:08:59,860
Nope.

2342
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:02,460
No, he's not in the cone.

2343
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:06,540
The surgery on his arm is all healed up.

2344
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,700
And it's almost like...

2345
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,160
It's almost like it was never there.

2346
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:14,140
And he used to have...

2347
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:18,120
Since they shaved his arms, he had chicken legs, but...

2348
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:22,560
Now his hair is growing back, so his legs look less like chicken bone legs.

2349
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:28,560
So yeah, that's why I haven't had so many updates, because...

2350
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:31,020
There hasn't really been anything to update.

2351
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,560
Stop!

2352
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:37,940
Eleven!

2353
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,740
You're so on brand.

2354
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:44,400
What should we do here, guys?

2355
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:47,260
Oh wait, right.

2356
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:52,580
Maybe we try... I was going to say we try.

2357
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:55,320
Oh wait, one, two, we got a queen.

2358
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:57,500
And a ten.

2359
02:09:58,140 --> 02:09:59,240
Queen and a ten.

2360
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:00,440
We can make it.

2361
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:02,880
Fish for queen.

2362
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:05,780
Let's do a flush.

2363
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:06,680
Wait, flush is what?

2364
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,800
Five cards that share the same suit.

2365
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:13,960
One, two, three.

2366
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:14,840
True!

2367
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:16,300
Let's try for the flush instead.

2368
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:24,480
I'm just going to throw these away, because if we get the queen and the ten, that would be good too.

2369
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:26,720
Takisawa, thanks for the ten yen!

2370
02:10:39,070 --> 02:10:40,270
Get rid of these two.

2371
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:42,230
Wait, one, two, three.

2372
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:43,650
We'll get rid of these three.

2373
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:49,150
We need ten or we need two more spades.

2374
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:51,410
That's a spade, right?

2375
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:52,430
Yeah.

2376
02:10:57,450 --> 02:10:58,410
One, two...

2377
02:10:58,410 --> 02:11:00,570
Wait, did I just... Did I get rid of a spade?

2378
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:07,740
I thought I had three.

2379
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:21,700
Yeah,

2380
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:28,900
I know the straight.

2381
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:34,820
Full house, we have that.

2382
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,560
Three of a kind and a pair.

2383
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:41,620
No, we could try.

2384
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:47,500
Is that riskier than going with the straight, I wonder.

2385
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:51,960
Full house, straight.

2386
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:56,080
Because I would have to get rid of stuff, you know.

2387
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:09,080
Yeah, I only have one discard.

2388
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:09,140
Discard.

2389
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:15,860
Full house is more likely.

2390
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:19,380
Full house is the... Sorry, I'm constantly having to check.

2391
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:23,080
Three of a kind and a pair, so if we try for a king...

2392
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:27,080
If we try for a king...

2393
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:33,150
Oh wait, no, no, no.

2394
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:34,410
That's a pair.

2395
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:42,600
We did it!

2396
02:12:45,630 --> 02:12:46,070
Nice!

2397
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:49,430
Did sims break?

2398
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:50,650
Unfortunately, yes.

2399
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:55,150
Yes, unfortunately the sims broke.

2400
02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:56,710
Nice!

2401
02:12:57,150 --> 02:12:58,810
Let's go guys, let's go.

2402
02:13:00,130 --> 02:13:00,690
What's the vows?

2403
02:13:00,790 --> 02:13:01,470
Oh, the re-roll.

2404
02:13:01,650 --> 02:13:03,110
One free re-roll.

2405
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:06,190
Level up straight flush.

2406
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:13,400
One of three playing cards.

2407
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:26,110
I'm gonna save money.

2408
02:13:26,730 --> 02:13:29,710
Skippa skippa, yeah, I was gonna say, I'm gonna say, I don't...

2409
02:13:30,390 --> 02:13:32,090
I thought about...

2410
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:35,710
I thought about...

2411
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:42,710
Adding some new cards or trying to get some special cards, but...

2412
02:13:49,970 --> 02:13:51,730
YouTube AI said this is Uno.

2413
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:06,190
I'm just gonna get rid of these for now, I suppose.

2414
02:14:08,230 --> 02:14:09,550
It is Uno, yeah.

2415
02:14:10,370 --> 02:14:13,050
Three of a... Wait, three is a flush?

2416
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:14,230
Wait, no, full house.

2417
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:15,010
Three and a pair.

2418
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:18,730
We need the pair.

2419
02:14:23,190 --> 02:14:24,370
What do I try the pair?

2420
02:14:26,470 --> 02:14:27,750
What do I try the pair?

2421
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:28,670
What do I try the pair?

2422
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:31,890
It could be anything.

2423
02:14:32,310 --> 02:14:32,750
Maybe...

2424
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:36,770
Maybe the ace, since I've been...

2425
02:14:38,090 --> 02:14:39,770
Since I have been...

2426
02:14:41,350 --> 02:14:42,210
Copying it.

2427
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:43,990
I have more aces, you know?

2428
02:14:44,330 --> 02:14:45,370
So let's get king.

2429
02:14:46,930 --> 02:14:47,610
Alright, discard.

2430
02:14:53,110 --> 02:14:53,730
Play!

2431
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:03,500
Megamon.

2432
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:08,180
That's the Bellatrio mindset.

2433
02:15:09,860 --> 02:15:10,340
Let's see.

2434
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:31,660
More aces, true.

2435
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:34,440
True.

2436
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:37,680
Wait, can I use it?

2437
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:39,880
How do I use it?

2438
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:47,340
You use while playing.

2439
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:07,720
Buy it?

2440
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:15,690
Buy it, sell it later?

2441
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:16,050
Okay.

2442
02:16:18,250 --> 02:16:21,190
Negative one hand size.

2443
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:25,820
Okay.

2444
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,300
Play.

2445
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:27,360
Play.

2446
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:33,680
Suit.

2447
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,040
Oh sorry, rank.

2448
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:41,480
Yeah, we do have two pairs.

2449
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:43,880
Wait, does that count though?

2450
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,600
Is it only one pair or is it two pairs?

2451
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:48,140
Does two pair count?

2452
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:51,220
Let's see.

2453
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:56,700
It does.

2454
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:02,480
We can do a full house.

2455
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:08,180
Should we go for the king?

2456
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:13,540
Move Joker to the right?

2457
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:13,840
Okay.

2458
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:15,080
Or baseball?

2459
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:15,520
Okay.

2460
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:17,060
Joker order.

2461
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:17,840
I forgot about that.

2462
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:18,420
Yeah, thank you.

2463
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:18,500
Yeah.

2464
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:23,520
Use a tarot.

2465
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:26,240
Wait...

2466
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:31,820
It's two cards.

2467
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:33,740
Wait...

2468
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:36,140
We could get four of a kind.

2469
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,840
We can do these two.

2470
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:40,180
We'll do these two.

2471
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,420
Yeah, we'll use...

2472
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:46,320
1, 2, 3, 4, baby, play!

2473
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:51,990
Ta-da!

2474
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:00,140
Nice.

2475
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:05,780
Plus one discard each round.

2476
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:10,640
Permanently gain one hand per round.

2477
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:15,880
Voucher is big.

2478
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:16,920
I like this one, yeah.

2479
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:17,360
Grabber.

2480
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:32,630
Grabby grab.

2481
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:38,260
I...

2482
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:41,020
I wish you could hold.

2483
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,040
I wish you could hold certain jokers.

2484
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:47,800
More discards is good for fishing.

2485
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:48,620
I know!

2486
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:54,260
That's why I'm like... But we just got a bigger hand, so...

2487
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:09,730
The gift is causing your cards to get better and... Wow!

2488
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,200
Nice.

2489
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:18,300
Yeah, we got eight dollars on these.

2490
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:19,300
Seven dollars.

2491
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:21,660
Save for now.

2492
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:22,040
Okay.

2493
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:24,020
Yeah, okay.

2494
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:25,440
We'll save for now.

2495
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:27,280
Okay.

2496
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,180
Let's go in, baby.

2497
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:30,840
Oh, nicer.

2498
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:34,480
Actually, this is not so bad.

2499
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:38,280
Play.

2500
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:41,560
We could even do the...

2501
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:44,060
The full house.

2502
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:46,120
We could do the full house.

2503
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:47,740
Let's try it.

2504
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:49,180
Discard?

2505
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:54,340
Discard?

2506
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:10,240
Then we got the two pair.

2507
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,260
How much is that?

2508
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:13,200
Plus eight multiplier?

2509
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:14,740
Let's try it.

2510
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:16,020
I think that should be enough.

2511
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:22,510
That was not enough.

2512
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:32,460
What did I do?

2513
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:36,880
That was one pair.

2514
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:46,490
You played a king, queen?

2515
02:20:53,090 --> 02:20:53,610
Oopsie.

2516
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:57,210
Oopsie.

2517
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:08,120
Hmm...

2518
02:21:15,220 --> 02:21:17,180
We almost have a straight.

2519
02:21:20,220 --> 02:21:22,160
Let's see if... Actually, wait.

2520
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:24,640
If I get one more, we can do the...

2521
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:26,180
The flush.

2522
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:29,160
So, one, two, three, four.

2523
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:30,200
Let's get rid of these.

2524
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:34,920
One, two, three, four, five!

2525
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:36,840
There we go.

2526
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:44,900
Nice.

2527
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:47,060
She had a straight.

2528
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:50,580
Yeah, but flush is better than a straight.

2529
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,760
So, take that.

2530
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:57,320
Flush is better than a straight.

2531
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:02,700
What's this guy?

2532
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:07,800
First played face card gives x2 multiplier when scored.

2533
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:12,660
Increases the rank of up to two cards selected by...

2534
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:12,860
Oh, wait.

2535
02:22:16,690 --> 02:22:19,510
Creates the last tarot or play a card you use during this round.

2536
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:22,610
I don't get it.

2537
02:22:23,870 --> 02:22:24,950
Photo Chad.

2538
02:22:27,770 --> 02:22:29,170
Wait, we are correcting Chad?

2539
02:22:29,710 --> 02:22:32,710
I might be a genius.

2540
02:22:33,310 --> 02:22:34,050
It's a cop...

2541
02:22:34,650 --> 02:22:36,590
The fool's tarot copies.

2542
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:40,610
It's a copier of your last planet card.

2543
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:43,010
Oh, which I...

2544
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:46,110
I have not... I don't have that.

2545
02:22:46,210 --> 02:22:48,030
But I could buy it and just have it.

2546
02:22:52,990 --> 02:22:55,210
Wait, first... So, wait, is this one good?

2547
02:22:55,410 --> 02:22:58,550
The first played face card gives x2 multiplier when scored.

2548
02:22:59,290 --> 02:23:00,590
I mean, it doesn't seem bad.

2549
02:23:02,650 --> 02:23:03,850
That's what it would copy.

2550
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:08,390
Oh, it would just copy this one?

2551
02:23:08,490 --> 02:23:09,230
That would be so funny.

2552
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:13,450
Oh, it would copy the strength.

2553
02:23:13,630 --> 02:23:15,750
Oh, yeah, it does say tarot or planet card.

2554
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:16,830
I know how to read.

2555
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:32,360
We could hold on to it.

2556
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:36,580
The strength is not bad.

2557
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:41,880
Because if we use it in the situation we did before, you know...

2558
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:51,760
Let's just hold on to it for now.

2559
02:23:59,030 --> 02:24:00,870
I love copying.

2560
02:24:06,850 --> 02:24:10,270
If we get a jack, we can have a...

2561
02:24:10,990 --> 02:24:11,630
That's right.

2562
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:13,810
4, 1, 2, 3.

2563
02:24:14,710 --> 02:24:16,810
Or we can get a...

2564
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:20,450
Jolly joker 5 left, Minto, please.

2565
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:21,390
Oh, sorry.

2566
02:24:22,750 --> 02:24:23,810
I already left.

2567
02:24:27,450 --> 02:24:28,870
Tarot perfect here.

2568
02:24:34,030 --> 02:24:34,690
But...

2569
02:24:37,030 --> 02:24:38,910
But what would I...

2570
02:24:38,910 --> 02:24:41,910
Maybe I could try to get 2 queens?

2571
02:24:43,650 --> 02:24:46,170
Or I mean, I could try and get more aces.

2572
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:50,070
To get like a 4 of a kind or something, you know?

2573
02:24:56,140 --> 02:24:57,440
Fish for a jack.

2574
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:01,640
I think I need to stop doing straights so much though, because I...

2575
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:03,320
Well, unless I level it up, but...

2576
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:05,280
Look!

2577
02:25:05,660 --> 02:25:08,540
Look, we've done 3 full houses...

2578
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:11,620
And 0 straights, even though I keep trying to get straights.

2579
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:13,500
You know?

2580
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:17,260
I feel like I'm wanting to do straights, but...

2581
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:21,720
I'm finding that doing the higher ones are even easier to get with my deck.

2582
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:25,440
You know?

2583
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:25,900
You know?

2584
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,320
You know?

2585
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:27,820
Just joined.

2586
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:28,820
Did the Sims not work?

2587
02:25:28,980 --> 02:25:30,060
Unfortunately, no.

2588
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:34,000
Straights can be really finicky.

2589
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:38,540
Sims 2 turned 21 this year.

2590
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:41,640
This year, the Sims 2 can officially drink.

2591
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:43,120
Wow.

2592
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:47,660
It'll finally drink itself to sleep.

2593
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:50,980
Since it's unplayable!

2594
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:54,840
It's a full house run.

2595
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:59,100
Let's try...

2596
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:00,200
Okay, you know what?

2597
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:02,200
Use...

2598
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:03,980
It becomes the strength...

2599
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:05,200
And then...

2600
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:07,080
Use...

2601
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:08,340
Okay...

2602
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,120
And then...

2603
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:12,120
I'm gonna go with the queen.

2604
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:17,920
We do have a pair.

2605
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:23,000
I'm just gonna play these.

2606
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:25,900
I'm just gonna play them.

2607
02:26:51,370 --> 02:26:53,690
We did it.

2608
02:26:53,690 --> 02:26:56,470
No, no, no, no.

2609
02:26:59,310 --> 02:27:00,150
Yippee!

2610
02:27:02,030 --> 02:27:02,870
Oh,

2611
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:06,890
it's the castle!

2612
02:27:08,270 --> 02:27:09,610
And then...

2613
02:27:09,610 --> 02:27:11,570
I played cards with odd rank.

2614
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:12,610
Give plus 31.

2615
02:27:13,370 --> 02:27:14,330
Chipsman scored.

2616
02:27:20,190 --> 02:27:21,690
Aces are odd.

2617
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:22,070
Yeah?

2618
02:27:22,530 --> 02:27:24,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2619
02:27:24,830 --> 02:27:28,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2620
02:27:30,310 --> 02:27:30,690
Yeah.

2621
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:34,970
But 31 chips doesn't feel very high.

2622
02:27:35,430 --> 02:27:36,190
Is it that good?

2623
02:27:36,650 --> 02:27:37,750
I'm trusting you guys.

2624
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:41,550
Lose $1 per card played.

2625
02:27:42,050 --> 02:27:43,830
I'm gonna have no money!

2626
02:27:44,930 --> 02:27:45,330
Wait.

2627
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:47,390
I'm actually gonna have no money.

2628
02:27:56,030 --> 02:27:57,350
My money!

2629
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:02,680
I'm getting rid of like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2630
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:04,600
I'm getting rid of like everything right here.

2631
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:06,600
Actually...

2632
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:08,660
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

2633
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:11,020
I have a...

2634
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:13,040
I have a...

2635
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:20,680
I have a flush!

2636
02:28:22,620 --> 02:28:23,740
I have a flush!

2637
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:24,160
I have a flush!

2638
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:29,640
Sorry.

2639
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:36,260
That one struggled against me.

2640
02:28:48,630 --> 02:28:51,850
Am I gonna go into the negatives?

2641
02:28:52,450 --> 02:28:53,390
Is that even possible?

2642
02:29:00,910 --> 02:29:01,350
No.

2643
02:29:03,570 --> 02:29:04,750
It is possible.

2644
02:29:04,990 --> 02:29:05,350
Oh gosh.

2645
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:06,490
Wait, this isn't The Sims.

2646
02:29:06,670 --> 02:29:06,970
No!

2647
02:29:07,770 --> 02:29:09,870
Stop rubbing it in my face!

2648
02:29:13,930 --> 02:29:15,790
I'm gonna get rid of...

2649
02:29:17,850 --> 02:29:18,690
these 4.

2650
02:29:19,490 --> 02:29:19,930
5.

2651
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:25,600
Dang it.

2652
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:26,480
But...

2653
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:26,920
What is it?

2654
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:27,320
4 of a kind.

2655
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:27,620
Sorry.

2656
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,080
I know I'm always looking.

2657
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:30,280
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2658
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:32,460
4, 3, 4.

2659
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:37,240
Go for 5 of a kind.

2660
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:37,700
It's okay.

2661
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:42,480
We still won.

2662
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:50,730
We didn't go into the negatives!

2663
02:29:51,610 --> 02:29:52,170
Yippee!

2664
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:54,470
Tarot cards appear to the... Okay, nevermind.

2665
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,640
So does it increase?

2666
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:12,560
Go up to 20... Oh, I guess you can go into the negatives.

2667
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:18,140
It does go up.

2668
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:20,580
So...

2669
02:30:25,170 --> 02:30:27,650
I think we can sell...

2670
02:30:31,170 --> 02:30:32,110
What's this one?

2671
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:34,150
Uncommon jokers.

2672
02:30:34,790 --> 02:30:36,110
How many uncommons do I got?

2673
02:30:36,990 --> 02:30:37,930
Only one.

2674
02:30:40,410 --> 02:30:41,790
Sell Jolly Joker?

2675
02:30:45,190 --> 02:30:49,100
I don't... I think I can get rid of this one, actually.

2676
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:53,040
I know this game was intimidating for you at first, but you're a natural, for real!

2677
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:55,380
Hope this makes up for the dollars the tooth stole.

2678
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:56,960
Keep bonking those Jonkler streamers.

2679
02:30:57,340 --> 02:30:58,020
Thank you!

2680
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:00,200
Thank you so much for the first hour!

2681
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:01,340
It's super tiny, even.

2682
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:04,920
Is it legitimate?

2683
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:06,940
Thank you.

2684
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:13,860
That one makes the other sell better, which means Jolly is high.

2685
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:16,680
Jolly is only $5.

2686
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:21,420
Yeah, he'd be our uncommon, so if I...

2687
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:23,260
Oh, wait, you're right.

2688
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:24,240
So if I unsold...

2689
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:27,000
Okay.

2690
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:30,420
I guess...

2691
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:31,260
Yeah, okay.

2692
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:32,920
I understand.

2693
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:36,220
Okay.

2694
02:31:38,320 --> 02:31:40,300
Doesn't matter where I put him.

2695
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,180
Here.

2696
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:45,420
I think.

2697
02:31:58,420 --> 02:32:00,860
Odd to left, baseball to right.

2698
02:32:04,630 --> 02:32:04,990
Okay.

2699
02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:08,310
Okay.

2700
02:32:09,410 --> 02:32:09,930
Next round.

2701
02:32:13,170 --> 02:32:14,730
Gift needs to be left, too?

2702
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:17,330
Does it?

2703
02:32:19,550 --> 02:32:20,830
Gift should be right?

2704
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:21,870
Wait, why are you...

2705
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:23,990
People are telling me two opposite things.

2706
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:29,830
Gift doesn't matter where it is.

2707
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:30,870
Yeah, I didn't think so, right?

2708
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:32,710
Because it's only just giving us a dollar.

2709
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:34,410
Doesn't really matter.

2710
02:32:34,930 --> 02:32:35,090
Okay.

2711
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:38,190
We almost have a strike!

2712
02:32:40,770 --> 02:32:42,430
But we also almost have a flash.

2713
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:48,940
We also almost have a strike... Wait.

2714
02:32:49,780 --> 02:32:50,200
Here.

2715
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:52,580
Let's try and get a jack.

2716
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:56,820
We did it.

2717
02:32:58,340 --> 02:33:00,140
Mentioned Henya is the cutest VTuber.

2718
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:03,500
I agree, Henya is the cutest VTuber.

2719
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:05,480
It's my Kamiyoshi there.

2720
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:11,360
You're looking for your most popular hand.

2721
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:14,820
But I... It's my most popular, but...

2722
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:17,500
But... But... But...

2723
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:18,500
I have no multiplier.

2724
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:20,060
I have no levels up on anything.

2725
02:33:23,080 --> 02:33:24,400
I have no levels up.

2726
02:33:34,430 --> 02:33:34,910
Two pair.

2727
02:33:35,290 --> 02:33:36,730
Two pair is more popular.

2728
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:39,830
Oh my gosh, you're right!

2729
02:33:39,890 --> 02:33:40,650
I didn't even notice.

2730
02:33:41,550 --> 02:33:42,150
Two pair.

2731
02:33:43,350 --> 02:33:44,170
High card.

2732
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:46,270
Oh yeah, because I play the ace all the time.

2733
02:33:46,930 --> 02:33:47,590
I was like, what?

2734
02:33:48,090 --> 02:33:49,230
Why is that so high?

2735
02:33:59,650 --> 02:34:02,870
I'm gonna go for...

2736
02:34:04,090 --> 02:34:04,970
Full house.

2737
02:34:04,970 --> 02:34:05,870
I'm

2738
02:34:10,790 --> 02:34:13,650
gonna go for full house.

2739
02:34:14,810 --> 02:34:15,830
With the queens.

2740
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:27,100
And how easy...

2741
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:29,920
Wait, what if I do four of a kind?

2742
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:30,600
That's even more.

2743
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:31,400
Just kidding.

2744
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:35,400
Easy peasy.

2745
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:48,100
Fish for five of a kind.

2746
02:34:48,260 --> 02:34:48,920
Oh, it's okay.

2747
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:52,440
Nice.

2748
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:54,180
One free reroll.

2749
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:56,440
100 trips played if...

2750
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:59,940
If it contains a straight.

2751
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:04,040
It's the hand I always am looking for.

2752
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:05,780
But the hand I never play.

2753
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:08,220
I literally am always looking for straight.

2754
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:10,080
But I never play it.

2755
02:35:11,240 --> 02:35:12,580
No straight here.

2756
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:16,980
Not this red.

2757
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:24,420
Okay, I'm gonna just go to the next room.

2758
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:55,900
Now I'm fishing for the five of a kind.

2759
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:00,320
Six of a kind?

2760
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:03,360
You spoiled me.

2761
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:05,100
Am I allowed to propose again?

2762
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:05,640
No!

2763
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:10,120
You are forbidden.

2764
02:36:15,590 --> 02:36:16,190
Ten thousand.

2765
02:36:16,190 --> 02:36:16,590
Ten thousand.

2766
02:36:17,090 --> 02:36:17,910
Holy moly.

2767
02:36:19,470 --> 02:36:19,990
Wow,

2768
02:36:23,030 --> 02:36:24,010
we got so much money.

2769
02:36:25,130 --> 02:36:25,270
What?

2770
02:36:26,850 --> 02:36:28,190
Three of a kind.

2771
02:36:28,770 --> 02:36:29,330
A flush.

2772
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:33,830
It's the same suit.

2773
02:36:35,130 --> 02:36:37,310
I kinda like what I have right now.

2774
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:42,700
Oh my gosh, I almost click sell.

2775
02:36:43,240 --> 02:36:44,980
I kinda like what I have right now.

2776
02:36:47,180 --> 02:36:48,400
Pop the buffoon?

2777
02:36:49,220 --> 02:36:49,700
No!

2778
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:56,140
Voucher might be a good idea.

2779
02:37:00,220 --> 02:37:02,160
I think I'm...

2780
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:04,880
But I will...

2781
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:06,520
The next is the boss round.

2782
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:07,960
Okay, I guess I'll get it.

2783
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:11,840
We'll get it.

2784
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:14,040
The wheel.

2785
02:37:14,180 --> 02:37:16,020
One in seven cars get drawn face down.

2786
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:26,060
Actually...

2787
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:26,880
Okay.

2788
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:29,600
Let's go for it, baby.

2789
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:31,080
Let's go for it, baby.

2790
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:32,240
Let's go for it, baby.

2791
02:37:49,330 --> 02:37:51,150
It could be a king, yeah.

2792
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,140
I'm just gonna get rid of them.

2793
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:12,160
That's an ace.

2794
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:13,220
That's an ace.

2795
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:15,760
We can keep this one.

2796
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,840
I think I'm...

2797
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:24,380
The five of a kind...

2798
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:28,780
The multiplier is so tempting.

2799
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:31,340
Let's just fish for it.

2800
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:32,220
It's fine.

2801
02:38:35,990 --> 02:38:36,910
We risk it.

2802
02:38:40,630 --> 02:38:41,770
We're risking it.

2803
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:56,600
Aw, man.

2804
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:02,180
I have two pairs.

2805
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:17,530
Maybe full house?

2806
02:39:18,930 --> 02:39:20,190
Wait, what's a full house again?

2807
02:39:20,310 --> 02:39:20,930
Sorry, hold on.

2808
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:24,010
Three of a kind and a pair.

2809
02:39:24,410 --> 02:39:26,050
No, this is definitely not an ace.

2810
02:39:27,690 --> 02:39:29,790
This is definitely... We don't know what this is.

2811
02:39:34,180 --> 02:39:35,140
It was...

2812
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:38,720
It was in my last hand and it was not in the ace area.

2813
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:43,460
This was in the previous hand.

2814
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:45,520
Yeah, it's joker or lower.

2815
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:46,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2816
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:59,940
I can't discard anything, so I guess I'll just...

2817
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:01,720
We'll do the two pairs.

2818
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:04,360
Yeah, see?

2819
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:05,620
Or jack, I mean.

2820
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:08,100
I think I said joker.

2821
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:08,840
This is jack.

2822
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:11,400
We're close.

2823
02:40:11,540 --> 02:40:12,040
We're close.

2824
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:12,800
We're close.

2825
02:40:14,740 --> 02:40:15,620
We're close.

2826
02:40:16,480 --> 02:40:17,360
What the heck?

2827
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:18,980
I was not moving.

2828
02:40:20,740 --> 02:40:21,820
The game is possessed.

2829
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:24,320
I'm not... My hand is not on the mouse.

2830
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:26,840
The one of a kind...

2831
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:29,880
Wait, play the one of a kind on the bottom right.

2832
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:35,520
It's possessed.

2833
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:36,020
It's possessed.

2834
02:40:36,180 --> 02:40:36,860
My game is haunted.

2835
02:40:36,860 --> 02:40:37,860
Okay.

2836
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:42,200
I don't like this.

2837
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:45,340
I still have plenty of hands.

2838
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:46,300
Well, I say plenty.

2839
02:40:46,480 --> 02:40:47,860
I don't wanna...

2840
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:53,780
Playing the aces pair will win?

2841
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:54,100
Really?

2842
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:55,920
Just this?

2843
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:56,260
Alone?

2844
02:41:00,570 --> 02:41:01,570
You're right!

2845
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:05,750
Our multiplier is too strong.

2846
02:41:05,750 --> 02:41:06,850
Let's go.

2847
02:41:08,010 --> 02:41:08,870
What's this at?

2848
02:41:09,830 --> 02:41:10,950
Plus ten multiplier.

2849
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:14,930
Oh, that's the holographic.

2850
02:41:15,490 --> 02:41:17,210
I wanna know what it's at though.

2851
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:25,420
Run info shows.

2852
02:41:29,030 --> 02:41:31,610
Like this number?

2853
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:36,410
18, 20...

2854
02:41:36,410 --> 02:41:38,550
25, 29...

2855
02:41:39,110 --> 02:41:39,510
31.

2856
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:42,990
Wait.

2857
02:41:43,890 --> 02:41:44,290
Yeah.

2858
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:51,460
Oh, it doesn't add up.

2859
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:52,140
It's per hand.

2860
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:56,840
Oh, so if I play the high card, I'll get a ten multiplier.

2861
02:41:58,580 --> 02:42:01,480
If I play two pair, I get eight multiplier.

2862
02:42:02,480 --> 02:42:04,820
I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

2863
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:10,140
Converts up to three selected cards to diamonds.

2864
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:13,360
I wish I could get some planet.

2865
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:17,640
Some planet so we can level up our thing.

2866
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,520
The Arcana pack.

2867
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:35,860
Yeah, we can try the Arcana.

2868
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:40,920
Let's see.

2869
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:42,220
Creates the last...

2870
02:42:42,220 --> 02:42:43,400
This one again.

2871
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:46,320
Converts up to three selected cards to spades.

2872
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:48,940
Creates up to two random planet cards.

2873
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:56,220
Enhances two selected cards to bonus cards.

2874
02:42:56,340 --> 02:42:57,680
That'd be good for...

2875
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:58,840
For these, right?

2876
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:01,840
Enhances two to lucky cards.

2877
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,900
What's a lucky card?

2878
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:14,520
1 in 5 chance for a plus 20?

2879
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:17,440
Left to take a nap and came back to cards.

2880
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:19,060
Good job, I know you're doing great.

2881
02:43:20,060 --> 02:43:21,180
Thanks, Layla.

2882
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:27,360
Lucky is good, maybe.

2883
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:30,860
Bonus would be safer.

2884
02:43:32,600 --> 02:43:37,120
Just gonna say thank you for keeping me entertained while I do my evening workout routines to slim down.

2885
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:38,700
I lost 17...

2886
02:43:42,260 --> 02:43:44,160
17 pounds in a month.

2887
02:43:44,620 --> 02:43:48,480
I planned on buying a treadmill to keep up my 10k steps a day routine.

2888
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:49,940
Earthworm!

2889
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:52,280
Congratulations, you got this!

2890
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:54,320
You got this.

2891
02:43:56,280 --> 02:44:00,120
I don't think I've tried lucky before, so I kind of want to use it.

2892
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:03,720
Let's test our luck, baby, baby!

2893
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:07,720
11,000.

2894
02:44:20,380 --> 02:44:21,640
Is this Bellatrio?

2895
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:22,720
It is.

2896
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:24,980
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2897
02:44:25,620 --> 02:44:26,140
Discard.

2898
02:44:29,880 --> 02:44:30,980
This is the flush.

2899
02:44:30,980 --> 02:44:33,600
No, this is the full house.

2900
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:37,460
Let's raise our multiplier.

2901
02:44:48,770 --> 02:44:50,090
There's her straight!

2902
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:53,870
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

2903
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:58,640
Oh my god!

2904
02:45:00,620 --> 02:45:02,040
Where did the Sims go?

2905
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:03,580
Ask EA!

2906
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:06,580
Why they can't do a decent pour?

2907
02:45:06,780 --> 02:45:08,000
Why the game is always crashing?

2908
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:13,080
Wait, 7?

2909
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:14,380
I can't do 7 straight.

2910
02:45:15,440 --> 02:45:16,480
But look at that!

2911
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:17,740
That is kind of crazy.

2912
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:18,600
I'm just going to play it.

2913
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:26,720
Okay.

2914
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:29,680
Another!

2915
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:30,900
Another full house!

2916
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:34,960
EA being EA.

2917
02:45:35,400 --> 02:45:35,880
Unfortunately.

2918
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:39,060
I'm still a little bummed about it.

2919
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:40,940
Because I really did want to play the Sims.

2920
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:42,700
I was so excited.

2921
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:47,920
Ah...

2922
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:48,800
Yay!

2923
02:45:58,690 --> 02:45:59,130
Okay.

2924
02:45:59,350 --> 02:46:00,250
The devil card.

2925
02:46:00,510 --> 02:46:03,050
Enhances one selected card into a gold card.

2926
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:07,150
With the gold... Oh, 3 dollars if the card is held in the hand at the end of the round.

2927
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:16,520
What's this one?

2928
02:46:16,660 --> 02:46:17,840
Sorry, I'm putting on hand lotion.

2929
02:46:19,060 --> 02:46:20,300
Oh, this one.

2930
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:31,260
Double Arcana pack sounds fun.

2931
02:46:31,420 --> 02:46:32,520
We could do both.

2932
02:46:32,620 --> 02:46:33,300
We could.

2933
02:46:39,090 --> 02:46:43,330
Boss re-roll is huge, but it's 10 dollars per roll.

2934
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:46,750
It's expensive.

2935
02:46:50,110 --> 02:46:51,770
Probably has free 20 dollars.

2936
02:46:54,750 --> 02:46:56,290
It could be worth it.

2937
02:46:58,470 --> 02:47:00,030
Okay, I'll get it.

2938
02:47:03,210 --> 02:47:05,830
Sorry, I wanted to at least do one Arcana.

2939
02:47:06,290 --> 02:47:07,810
Oh, we are not at the boss yet.

2940
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:12,660
Okay, that's fine.

2941
02:47:14,260 --> 02:47:15,540
I thought we were at the boss.

2942
02:47:19,340 --> 02:47:19,620
Okay.

2943
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:23,200
We have three.

2944
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:29,140
One, two...

2945
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:30,480
Okay, goodbye.

2946
02:47:35,980 --> 02:47:38,720
I love being able to play face cards.

2947
02:47:41,960 --> 02:47:43,480
Full house.

2948
02:47:47,990 --> 02:47:51,370
I'm going for... Oh, wait.

2949
02:47:52,230 --> 02:47:53,990
I'm going for more aces.

2950
02:47:57,470 --> 02:47:58,510
Ouch.

2951
02:48:09,460 --> 02:48:10,500
Ouch.

2952
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:17,280
Ouch.

2953
02:48:25,540 --> 02:48:27,640
Play the five dead cards?

2954
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:28,300
You're right.

2955
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:33,880
We'll at least get the multiplier on it.

2956
02:48:39,280 --> 02:48:40,460
Let's see.

2957
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:43,300
Let's see.

2958
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:45,140
20 multiplier!

2959
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:53,830
Nice.

2960
02:48:57,870 --> 02:48:59,690
We got a Celestial pack!

2961
02:49:00,630 --> 02:49:01,810
This one is plus eight.

2962
02:49:01,930 --> 02:49:02,590
Oh, the pair.

2963
02:49:03,150 --> 02:49:04,650
This Joker can...

2964
02:49:04,650 --> 02:49:08,430
This Joker gains plus two multiplier if the...

2965
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,290
Two pair.

2966
02:49:11,730 --> 02:49:12,390
Pants.

2967
02:49:21,800 --> 02:49:24,560
Do you think it's finally time to sell the gift?

2968
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:28,460
And we get the pants?

2969
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:34,040
Because then we would get the uncommon.

2970
02:49:34,340 --> 02:49:35,960
We would get another uncommon bonus.

2971
02:49:38,140 --> 02:49:39,060
Oh, but wait.

2972
02:49:39,320 --> 02:49:41,020
This is our only uncommon bonus.

2973
02:49:45,210 --> 02:49:48,090
I think maybe Odd Todd might be good.

2974
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:48,910
I don't know.

2975
02:49:50,390 --> 02:49:53,290
I think we might want to sell Odd Todd.

2976
02:50:01,180 --> 02:50:02,780
And then we'll get the two bonus.

2977
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:12,000
The pants are funny.

2978
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:16,320
Hold on.

2979
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:17,220
I'm going to make a message.

2980
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:17,920
I'm going to write a thing.

2981
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:24,460
The Sims kept crashing, so now we bilateral.

2982
02:50:25,180 --> 02:50:25,760
There we go.

2983
02:50:26,180 --> 02:50:27,440
Now everybody can stop asking.

2984
02:50:39,730 --> 02:50:41,690
First of all I want to open this.

2985
02:50:44,610 --> 02:50:45,890
Four of a kind?

2986
02:50:47,410 --> 02:50:47,910
Strange.

2987
02:50:48,830 --> 02:50:49,810
Full house.

2988
02:50:52,430 --> 02:50:54,270
We do full house quite a bit.

2989
02:50:54,630 --> 02:50:55,350
Full house is good.

2990
02:50:55,550 --> 02:50:56,330
Either would be good.

2991
02:50:56,450 --> 02:50:57,770
Four of a kind or full house.

2992
02:50:58,570 --> 02:51:00,430
I think we should go for the four of a kind though.

2993
02:51:03,740 --> 02:51:05,320
I wish I could have done two.

2994
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:07,560
I wish I could have done two.

2995
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:15,590
No.

2996
02:51:18,550 --> 02:51:20,770
Destroys up to two selected cards.

2997
02:51:21,050 --> 02:51:23,510
Enhances two selected to be lucky.

2998
02:51:24,870 --> 02:51:26,490
Oh, we can do more lucky cards.

2999
02:51:27,350 --> 02:51:30,270
We can do more lucky cards with the Wheel of Fortune.

3000
02:51:33,550 --> 02:51:35,150
Let's do the wheel!

3001
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:37,510
Wheel of Fortune!

3002
02:51:38,050 --> 02:51:39,290
Wheel of Fortune!

3003
02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:44,470
Wheel of Fortune!

3004
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:48,110
That's two for two baby.

3005
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:01,800
Wait!

3006
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:03,860
He was the one I was going to sell!

3007
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:08,940
We can't sell Odd Todd now!

3008
02:52:10,800 --> 02:52:12,520
He's our lucky guy!

3009
02:52:13,940 --> 02:52:14,440
No!

3010
02:52:17,370 --> 02:52:18,180
Sell DNA?

3011
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:18,700
No!

3012
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:19,960
I've been using it!

3013
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:38,320
No buff.

3014
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:41,280
It does actually have a buff because we have the Joker card.

3015
02:52:41,280 --> 02:52:44,660
Every uncommon gives us 1.5 multiplier.

3016
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:50,780
So that's why I would want to sell Odd Todd because then we could get the other uncommon.

3017
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:56,500
And it would make it even more of a multiplier.

3018
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:03,120
I can't.

3019
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:04,200
I can't.

3020
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:06,920
I can't.

3021
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:09,640
All face cards are... Oh!

3022
02:53:10,420 --> 02:53:10,920
Easy.

3023
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:11,920
We got this.

3024
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:15,180
Wait,

3025
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:27,670
what did we get from it?

3026
02:53:29,470 --> 02:53:34,790
Okay, so we can do the... See I told you guys I should have done the full house as the multiplier.

3027
02:53:35,970 --> 02:53:38,110
I do full house all the time!

3028
02:53:48,180 --> 02:53:52,100
I think gift card triggers from baseball later if it's on the right?

3029
02:53:53,820 --> 02:53:54,340
Wait, what?

3030
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:01,080
Gift on far right.

3031
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,620
Why?

3032
02:54:11,230 --> 02:54:12,630
I'm so confused.

3033
02:54:12,930 --> 02:54:12,990
Why?

3034
02:54:18,100 --> 02:54:18,780
Huh?

3035
02:54:25,460 --> 02:54:27,060
Baseball triggers the gift card.

3036
02:54:32,140 --> 02:54:32,740
What?

3037
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:51,380
I'm so confused.

3038
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:52,780
I don't understand at all.

3039
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:55,340
I don't understand at all.

3040
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:57,940
Explain it to me like I'm a baby.

3041
02:54:58,640 --> 02:54:59,680
I'm so confused.

3042
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:01,360
How does it make a difference?

3043
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:05,360
What?

3044
02:55:10,630 --> 02:55:12,830
1.5 is on gift card.

3045
02:55:13,070 --> 02:55:13,430
Yeah.

3046
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:20,030
So what?

3047
02:55:29,270 --> 02:55:32,790
You're in common have 1.5 times multiplier now.

3048
02:55:32,890 --> 02:55:34,910
Yeah, they did ever since we got baseball.

3049
02:55:35,570 --> 02:55:39,390
And everybody told me to put... Everybody said it didn't matter where the gift card went.

3050
02:55:40,290 --> 02:55:42,350
You want supernova to trigger first.

3051
02:55:44,510 --> 02:55:45,030
Okay.

3052
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:54,450
We messed up.

3053
02:55:54,550 --> 02:55:55,010
Oh, okay.

3054
02:56:00,900 --> 02:56:05,540
No, I know that the baseball makes the gift card have a multiplier.

3055
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:08,000
I just thought... Okay, hold on.

3056
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:12,100
Let me explain where my brain is coming from so that you guys understand why I was confused.

3057
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:20,060
So I thought that this didn't matter because I thought that this was what was triggering.

3058
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:24,780
It was and it was like counting how many uncommons were in here.

3059
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:31,020
And so that's why it's at the end because I thought that's what it would it would go the order of operations.

3060
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:33,280
It would go boom, boom, boom down the line.

3061
02:56:33,460 --> 02:56:36,380
And then at the end, it would say, okay, I'm counting through here.

3062
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:38,220
And now I'm going to apply the multiplier.

3063
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:43,860
That's why I was just like, why did it doesn't matter where it goes?

3064
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:46,480
Okay, Chad also thought that and was wrong.

3065
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:51,520
Okay, and then you guys saw that it was not acting in that way.

3066
02:56:51,940 --> 02:56:54,320
And then that's when you guys told me to move it.

3067
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:56,280
Okay, now we're all okay.

3068
02:56:56,640 --> 02:56:57,020
Okay.

3069
02:56:57,240 --> 02:56:58,500
Yeah, I get it.

3070
02:56:58,640 --> 02:56:59,260
I get it now.

3071
02:56:59,380 --> 02:56:59,660
Okay.

3072
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,240
Okay, we're all we're all we're all caught up teamwork.

3073
02:57:05,540 --> 02:57:09,180
Yeah, we we we we did the we did the prop.

3074
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:10,440
We did the problem solving.

3075
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:11,580
We did it guys.

3076
02:57:11,780 --> 02:57:12,780
We didn't read it.

3077
02:57:12,900 --> 02:57:13,580
We did it.

3078
02:57:16,820 --> 02:57:17,760
We did it.

3079
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:18,140
We did it.

3080
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:18,700
I understand.

3081
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:19,340
I understand.

3082
02:57:19,460 --> 02:57:19,900
I understand.

3083
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:24,440
Let me see if I can try and explain it for people who are confused.

3084
02:57:25,140 --> 02:57:32,680
So this baseball card gives every uncommon card a 1.5 multiplier.

3085
02:57:33,360 --> 02:57:36,020
We only have one uncommon card.

3086
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:41,860
What everyone thought is that it would go, okay, down the line.

3087
02:57:42,240 --> 02:57:46,260
And when it got to the end, it would apply that multiplier.

3088
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:52,420
But so that's why, you know, that it would like go through all the cards and count.

3089
02:57:52,680 --> 02:57:58,620
But it was actually just already applying it as soon as we got here to the gift card.

3090
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:10,660
And so by putting the gift card at the end, it will accumulate all this and then give the 1.5 multiplier here, which will in turn give us a better payout.

3091
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:21,960
But but the gift card itself doesn't give any any incentive, I guess, is what you would call it.

3092
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:24,440
And so that's why I was like, we can put it anywhere in here.

3093
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:25,220
It doesn't matter.

3094
02:58:25,220 --> 02:58:29,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3095
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:32,660
But yeah, yeah, yeah.

3096
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:34,900
But that's why we move it down here.

3097
02:58:35,360 --> 02:58:36,540
I hope I explain it.

3098
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:37,440
Okay.

3099
02:58:38,620 --> 02:58:41,140
I hope I get it doesn't actually get it.

3100
02:58:41,140 --> 02:58:42,260
Did I explain it okay?

3101
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:45,300
Did I try it?

3102
02:58:45,440 --> 02:58:47,500
Did I try to make it easy for everybody?

3103
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:52,620
Okay, I'm going to do the actually I'm going to fish for more aces.

3104
02:58:55,220 --> 02:59:01,020
I know I could do the flesh, but since we got the four of a kind leveled up, let's get the four of a kind.

3105
02:59:08,360 --> 02:59:09,140
You got it.

3106
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:09,920
You did a good job.

3107
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:10,900
You got me brained.

3108
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,580
Okay, can't make it simpler than that.

3109
02:59:15,620 --> 02:59:16,160
Okay.

3110
02:59:20,360 --> 02:59:22,180
Oh, play the nines and the twos.

3111
02:59:22,300 --> 02:59:23,820
True, we can just play this.

3112
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:24,820
So true.

3113
02:59:26,040 --> 02:59:30,040
So true, we can just play it instead of discarding it.

3114
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:31,860
Yeah, it's a decent hand.

3115
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:37,940
One, two, three, four, five.

3116
02:59:40,760 --> 02:59:41,480
Oh wait!

3117
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:43,200
I meant the four of a kind.

3118
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:43,680
No!

3119
02:59:45,340 --> 02:59:45,820
No!

3120
02:59:46,700 --> 02:59:47,180
Wait!

3121
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:48,200
I messed up.

3122
02:59:49,500 --> 02:59:51,060
But in the end, it still worked out.

3123
02:59:51,960 --> 02:59:54,260
Multipliers at the end maximizes the mult size.

3124
02:59:54,400 --> 02:59:55,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3125
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:56,200
Exactly, exactly.

3126
02:59:58,640 --> 02:59:59,980
We still did okay.

3127
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:04,500
No, I don't want that.

3128
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:08,380
All cards and packs in the shop are 25% off.

3129
03:00:08,600 --> 03:00:09,640
Whoa, this one's crazy.

3130
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:13,980
When small blind or big blind is selected, gain...

3131
03:00:14,680 --> 03:00:17,000
No, I don't want to destroy a joker.

3132
03:00:17,240 --> 03:00:17,880
That's scary.

3133
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:22,220
Let's get the voucher.

3134
03:00:25,180 --> 03:00:26,300
Clearance sale!

3135
03:00:26,780 --> 03:00:28,280
Yeah, this one's scary.

3136
03:00:29,460 --> 03:00:30,980
This one's too scary.

3137
03:00:31,140 --> 03:00:35,700
We could ruin our entire build with this guy.

3138
03:00:36,860 --> 03:00:38,020
That's scary.

3139
03:00:38,680 --> 03:00:39,520
That's scary.

3140
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:41,560
Sacrifice jokers.

3141
03:00:41,740 --> 03:00:42,620
No, that was scary.

3142
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:46,520
Madness is good, but not now.

3143
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:47,140
Okay, mod.

3144
03:00:52,360 --> 03:00:54,840
Let's get a jumble.

3145
03:00:59,360 --> 03:01:01,140
Converts to spades.

3146
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,460
Stone card.

3147
03:01:04,380 --> 03:01:07,720
Gives the total sell value of all current jokers.

3148
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:10,480
Free money!

3149
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:14,300
Enhances one into a wild card.

3150
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:17,680
This might actually be good.

3151
03:01:20,540 --> 03:01:23,060
We could get free money though.

3152
03:01:23,220 --> 03:01:23,900
There's a lot of money.

3153
03:01:24,040 --> 03:01:25,620
Damn, there's a lot of money!

3154
03:01:28,280 --> 03:01:28,620
You know what?

3155
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:29,300
Why not?

3156
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:36,080
You know what?

3157
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:38,060
I can play face cards, so why not?

3158
03:01:54,810 --> 03:01:56,450
There we go!

3159
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:15,520
1, 2, 3, 4...

3160
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:18,800
Let's see if we can get... What's it called?

3161
03:02:21,180 --> 03:02:21,900
The flush.

3162
03:02:22,580 --> 03:02:23,620
Let's see if we can get a flush.

3163
03:02:32,990 --> 03:02:33,710
I see.

3164
03:02:34,390 --> 03:02:36,150
So far, you're doing a really good job, Minto.

3165
03:02:36,350 --> 03:02:38,330
You're picking up the game faster than most people I've seen.

3166
03:02:38,430 --> 03:02:38,710
Really?

3167
03:02:39,410 --> 03:02:41,410
That's just because everybody's been helping, you know?

3168
03:02:42,670 --> 03:02:43,330
I think.

3169
03:02:45,870 --> 03:02:48,290
This is just because everybody's been helping me.

3170
03:02:57,400 --> 03:02:57,840
Actually...

3171
03:02:57,840 --> 03:02:59,000
You know what?

3172
03:02:59,020 --> 03:02:59,480
This works.

3173
03:02:59,980 --> 03:03:00,780
It's a full house.

3174
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:05,160
Full house...

3175
03:03:07,720 --> 03:03:08,500
And game.

3176
03:03:10,720 --> 03:03:12,380
But you get it, get it, get it?

3177
03:03:12,620 --> 03:03:14,300
I get it, I think I get it.

3178
03:03:14,300 --> 03:03:21,300
But I feel more confident when I play with you guys, because you guys help me see things that I don't see.

3179
03:03:25,940 --> 03:03:26,700
Plus 4.

3180
03:03:26,820 --> 03:03:28,500
Oh, it's just a regular jonkler!

3181
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:29,760
Wow.

3182
03:03:30,400 --> 03:03:31,700
Regular jonkler.

3183
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:35,420
So that's still packs important.

3184
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:36,820
4 of a kind.

3185
03:03:37,780 --> 03:03:39,640
High card is kind of big.

3186
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:42,340
Oh my gosh, all three of these are good!

3187
03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:48,060
I think we gotta do the planet X.

3188
03:03:50,500 --> 03:03:51,780
Regular jonkler.

3189
03:03:52,400 --> 03:03:55,080
Just a normal guy with a normal life.

3190
03:03:55,740 --> 03:03:58,440
But there's something about him that no one knows yet.

3191
03:04:00,100 --> 03:04:02,180
Creates up to 2 random tarot cards.

3192
03:04:05,080 --> 03:04:08,920
Select 2 cards, convert the left card into the right card.

3193
03:04:10,120 --> 03:04:11,660
We could...

3194
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:15,140
We could like make a random 2.

3195
03:04:20,360 --> 03:04:21,080
Or wait.

3196
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:25,160
Left card into right card.

3197
03:04:25,720 --> 03:04:28,600
Enhances 2 cards to multiply... wait.

3198
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:32,720
That's kind of big, is it not?

3199
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:36,640
Enhances 2 selected cards into multiplier cards.

3200
03:04:37,100 --> 03:04:38,640
I think that would be even better.

3201
03:04:39,960 --> 03:04:40,600
Probably.

3202
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:44,160
Convert up to 3 into diamonds.

3203
03:04:44,620 --> 03:04:45,140
Oh no!

3204
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:46,520
Double money.

3205
03:04:48,200 --> 03:04:50,740
I think this one might be better for now.

3206
03:04:50,860 --> 03:04:51,420
The empress.

3207
03:05:14,580 --> 03:05:15,140
Crazy.

3208
03:05:19,180 --> 03:05:19,600
Nice.

3209
03:05:24,750 --> 03:05:25,910
4 of a kind, baby.

3210
03:05:26,710 --> 03:05:28,850
Leave the empress to my emperor.

3211
03:05:31,650 --> 03:05:33,010
What is your kingdom?

3212
03:05:33,330 --> 03:05:34,470
What is your kingdom, oven?

3213
03:05:35,990 --> 03:05:37,250
1, 2, 3.

3214
03:05:37,390 --> 03:05:38,370
Oh, we almost have a straight!

3215
03:05:39,550 --> 03:05:41,610
Wow, look how pretty the cards are.

3216
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:47,370
We have 2 pairs.

3217
03:05:48,270 --> 03:05:49,110
I'll do the 2 pairs.

3218
03:05:51,490 --> 03:05:53,410
What is your economy like?

3219
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:06,620
I'm going fishing.

3220
03:06:10,100 --> 03:06:10,620
Wait.

3221
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:14,740
I'm going fishing.

3222
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:19,780
I thought this was a pair.

3223
03:06:22,120 --> 03:06:23,040
I'm going fishing.

3224
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:27,800
Wait.

3225
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:38,060
Hold on, I'm thinking.

3226
03:06:38,600 --> 03:06:42,300
I'm thinking if I want to play this or if I want to discard it.

3227
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:45,400
I'll just play it.

3228
03:06:46,440 --> 03:06:51,380
We can get the... We can keep multiplying the runs, you know?

3229
03:06:51,620 --> 03:06:52,600
I think would be good.

3230
03:06:57,040 --> 03:06:58,800
Because we get more.

3231
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:03,480
So basically the higher we get this, the more multiplier we get on it too.

3232
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:07,140
So, if I can...

3233
03:07:08,060 --> 03:07:10,060
If I can play it, I will.

3234
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:11,740
My kingdom?

3235
03:07:12,060 --> 03:07:13,220
Hopefully it can be our kingdom.

3236
03:07:17,980 --> 03:07:18,560
Stop!

3237
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:21,860
Straight!

3238
03:07:28,870 --> 03:07:30,450
No, this is you, oven.

3239
03:07:30,650 --> 03:07:31,750
The jumbo buffoon pair.

3240
03:07:35,750 --> 03:07:37,550
Jumbo buffoon over here!

3241
03:07:39,030 --> 03:07:40,990
I'll open this in honor of you.

3242
03:07:43,130 --> 03:07:43,950
Let's see.

3243
03:07:44,090 --> 03:07:44,450
Play it.

3244
03:07:44,510 --> 03:07:45,130
Aces!

3245
03:07:47,530 --> 03:07:50,390
Give plus 20 chips, 4 times multiplier.

3246
03:07:53,800 --> 03:07:56,130
I think we got... Ok, Odd Todd.

3247
03:07:57,930 --> 03:08:01,190
Odd Todd, you've lived your life.

3248
03:08:02,470 --> 03:08:05,610
Sell this card to disable the current boss blind.

3249
03:08:05,770 --> 03:08:06,110
Interesting.

3250
03:08:09,590 --> 03:08:11,090
Sayonara, Odd Todd!

3251
03:08:13,030 --> 03:08:15,090
He was our lucky guy though.

3252
03:08:20,070 --> 03:08:21,490
Where would this go?

3253
03:08:21,610 --> 03:08:22,110
Like here?

3254
03:08:22,770 --> 03:08:23,030
Yeah.

3255
03:08:24,010 --> 03:08:25,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3256
03:08:25,470 --> 03:08:25,890
Yeah, yeah.

3257
03:08:25,970 --> 03:08:26,590
That's fine.

3258
03:08:32,790 --> 03:08:33,710
Far left.

3259
03:08:34,590 --> 03:08:35,290
Left of gift?

3260
03:08:35,930 --> 03:08:36,630
Yeah, yeah, right?

3261
03:08:36,830 --> 03:08:37,710
Yeah, this is fine then.

3262
03:08:38,410 --> 03:08:39,010
You know what?

3263
03:08:39,010 --> 03:08:39,930
I'm just gonna level up.

3264
03:08:39,930 --> 03:08:41,210
Buy and use.

3265
03:08:41,270 --> 03:08:41,610
Why not?

3266
03:08:41,990 --> 03:08:46,170
I don't ever use a straight, but if it ever happens, who knows?

3267
03:08:46,810 --> 03:08:47,570
Who knows?

3268
03:08:52,960 --> 03:08:54,920
And I'm even gonna buy more.

3269
03:08:58,080 --> 03:08:59,960
Oh, Dave the Diver.

3270
03:09:00,940 --> 03:09:01,980
I like it.

3271
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:03,860
We're gonna put him in.

3272
03:09:06,780 --> 03:09:08,100
Get the hangman.

3273
03:09:09,100 --> 03:09:11,380
Destroys up to two selected cards.

3274
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:14,220
I'm attached.

3275
03:09:14,400 --> 03:09:14,860
Reroll.

3276
03:09:17,740 --> 03:09:18,700
Banana!

3277
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:23,560
One in a thousand chance!

3278
03:09:24,080 --> 03:09:25,320
This ultimate banana.

3279
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:27,180
Uh-oh, it's the bus stop.

3280
03:09:28,160 --> 03:09:30,440
I'm not getting the bus.

3281
03:09:32,900 --> 03:09:34,100
Gone banana.

3282
03:09:35,940 --> 03:09:37,880
Wait, what would I get rid of though?

3283
03:09:41,380 --> 03:09:45,780
Time to sell the gift for this, but then I don't have this multiplier anymore.

3284
03:09:49,880 --> 03:09:51,540
I have no uncommon.

3285
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:59,640
Should I not then sell the baseball card?

3286
03:10:00,900 --> 03:10:03,180
Instead of the gift card.

3287
03:10:08,900 --> 03:10:09,340
DNA?

3288
03:10:09,620 --> 03:10:10,120
No, no, no.

3289
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:11,620
We're gonna keep DNA for now still.

3290
03:10:20,080 --> 03:10:21,480
I'm keeping DNA.

3291
03:10:24,890 --> 03:10:25,770
Sell baseball.

3292
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:47,460
You can still sell the scholar.

3293
03:10:47,580 --> 03:10:49,600
I think this one is too good to have, honestly.

3294
03:10:50,900 --> 03:10:53,520
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of...

3295
03:10:56,680 --> 03:11:00,260
I have so much money, I feel like I can sell the gift card.

3296
03:11:00,380 --> 03:11:03,900
I mean, I know I'm gonna spend money later, but like...

3297
03:11:03,900 --> 03:11:11,900
I wanna keep this one because I think this would be good if I find another uncommon and then we can get rid of one of these, you know?

3298
03:11:12,360 --> 03:11:14,360
So I think I'm gonna sell the gift card.

3299
03:11:29,740 --> 03:11:34,460
Well, it doesn't matter because baseball is useless right now, but that's okay.

3300
03:11:34,780 --> 03:11:36,580
Okay, discard two random cards per hand.

3301
03:11:38,160 --> 03:11:38,680
Scary.

3302
03:11:44,060 --> 03:11:45,540
Wait, I'm scared.

3303
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:48,120
I'm gonna play it though.

3304
03:11:49,160 --> 03:11:50,480
Please don't get rid of my aces.

3305
03:11:59,800 --> 03:12:01,220
Play the four of a kind.

3306
03:12:12,680 --> 03:12:13,060
Nice.

3307
03:12:16,700 --> 03:12:18,200
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

3308
03:12:19,320 --> 03:12:20,320
One, two, three, four, five.

3309
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:21,180
Goodbye.

3310
03:12:23,060 --> 03:12:23,800
Two pairs.

3311
03:12:28,620 --> 03:12:30,020
Two pairs.

3312
03:12:35,420 --> 03:12:36,120
Safe.

3313
03:12:44,870 --> 03:12:48,070
Minus one ante... Oh, it's this one.

3314
03:12:48,670 --> 03:12:48,750
No.

3315
03:12:49,230 --> 03:12:49,770
Jumbo.

3316
03:12:57,740 --> 03:12:58,840
Three of a kind.

3317
03:12:58,920 --> 03:12:59,500
No, no, no.

3318
03:12:59,560 --> 03:13:00,200
Two pair.

3319
03:13:00,200 --> 03:13:03,120
I think we gotta go with planet X again.

3320
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:18,580
Let's just go.

3321
03:13:27,780 --> 03:13:29,000
Keep on multiplying.

3322
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:33,600
Keep on multiplying.

3323
03:13:34,460 --> 03:13:35,360
Minky's so frugal.

3324
03:13:35,600 --> 03:13:36,880
I am, I'm sorry.

3325
03:13:39,200 --> 03:13:39,980
Goodbye.

3326
03:13:47,300 --> 03:13:57,820
Right now I've been doing more four of a kind, since I think that one technically gives us more than five of a kind.

3327
03:13:58,640 --> 03:13:59,380
Oh wait, no.

3328
03:14:00,240 --> 03:14:02,340
Actually, I've been leveling up the five of a kind.

3329
03:14:03,140 --> 03:14:03,800
I'm an idiot!

3330
03:14:06,960 --> 03:14:08,020
I'm so stupid!

3331
03:14:08,520 --> 03:14:09,080
I'm an idiot?

3332
03:14:09,300 --> 03:14:10,560
Nevermind, five of a kind is better.

3333
03:14:11,980 --> 03:14:12,580
Straight.

3334
03:14:13,820 --> 03:14:15,640
You know what, let's buy and use both of them.

3335
03:14:16,880 --> 03:14:17,480
Go for it.

3336
03:14:23,840 --> 03:14:25,520
I kinda pack.

3337
03:14:33,450 --> 03:14:34,650
Wild card.

3338
03:14:35,290 --> 03:14:37,510
Enhances one into a steel card!

3339
03:14:37,850 --> 03:14:39,510
Isn't steel the best, right?

3340
03:14:39,510 --> 03:14:42,510
We could get free money, but also...

3341
03:14:45,270 --> 03:14:46,890
Money is on sale.

3342
03:14:47,510 --> 03:14:48,890
Temperance for more money?

3343
03:14:49,570 --> 03:14:52,370
You guys, I have over a hundred dollars!

3344
03:14:54,510 --> 03:14:55,890
Steel ace!

3345
03:14:58,430 --> 03:15:00,510
Cause then I can start...

3346
03:15:04,340 --> 03:15:05,790
Doing that one.

3347
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:13,760
What does re-trigger this card one time?

3348
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:14,400
What does that mean?

3349
03:15:15,100 --> 03:15:15,700
I skip.

3350
03:15:17,940 --> 03:15:18,600
Reroll?

3351
03:15:18,780 --> 03:15:19,000
Okay.

3352
03:15:22,680 --> 03:15:24,840
Two random tarot cards.

3353
03:15:25,980 --> 03:15:27,200
Should we try it?

3354
03:15:27,600 --> 03:15:28,480
The two random.

3355
03:15:37,110 --> 03:15:38,030
Play again.

3356
03:15:38,210 --> 03:15:38,350
Okay.

3357
03:15:39,590 --> 03:15:40,130
Use it.

3358
03:15:40,810 --> 03:15:41,210
Let's go.

3359
03:15:46,560 --> 03:15:48,880
This one is so good too!

3360
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:49,760
Oh my god.

3361
03:15:55,300 --> 03:15:56,100
Fortune!

3362
03:16:03,240 --> 03:16:05,080
My luck is all dried up.

3363
03:16:07,620 --> 03:16:09,980
My luck is all rotten dry.

3364
03:16:09,980 --> 03:16:10,960
Rotten dry!

3365
03:16:17,620 --> 03:16:20,960
I could technically get this one.

3366
03:16:21,660 --> 03:16:23,240
But I think it's okay.

3367
03:16:24,380 --> 03:16:26,920
But isn't there like a five of a kind?

3368
03:16:27,080 --> 03:16:29,880
Like a five flush or something crazy?

3369
03:16:30,300 --> 03:16:31,360
Reroll more?

3370
03:16:32,300 --> 03:16:33,500
It's getting expensive.

3371
03:16:35,800 --> 03:16:38,640
I don't have room for two planet cards.

3372
03:16:39,980 --> 03:16:41,220
I want this one though.

3373
03:16:43,780 --> 03:16:44,640
Flush five.

3374
03:16:47,980 --> 03:16:48,840
Just hold it?

3375
03:16:48,920 --> 03:16:49,320
Oh, okay.

3376
03:16:50,060 --> 03:16:50,380
Buy.

3377
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:52,360
Okay.

3378
03:16:53,700 --> 03:16:54,980
Okay, that should be good.

3379
03:17:00,090 --> 03:17:02,030
But what if I get some planet cards?

3380
03:17:03,050 --> 03:17:03,470
What the?

3381
03:17:03,970 --> 03:17:04,870
Why did that one yell at me?

3382
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:08,330
Can I

3383
03:17:20,930 --> 03:17:21,830
just buy this?

3384
03:17:22,070 --> 03:17:24,230
If I buy it, will it add the space in?

3385
03:17:34,880 --> 03:17:36,360
Sayonara face cards.

3386
03:17:38,610 --> 03:17:39,860
This is so dumb.

3387
03:17:40,920 --> 03:17:42,000
Oh my god.

3388
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:42,700
No way.

3389
03:17:43,660 --> 03:17:45,020
Just don't play face cards.

3390
03:17:45,340 --> 03:17:46,500
Sayonara face cards.

3391
03:17:47,140 --> 03:17:48,040
No way.

3392
03:17:48,140 --> 03:17:49,220
I can't believe this is happening.

3393
03:17:49,220 --> 03:17:49,940
I mean...

3394
03:17:52,880 --> 03:17:57,200
This is getting really scary to my old build.

3395
03:17:59,180 --> 03:18:00,740
This is getting too scary.

3396
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:02,960
No!

3397
03:18:04,040 --> 03:18:04,780
No!

3398
03:18:06,340 --> 03:18:06,680
Wait.

3399
03:18:08,080 --> 03:18:10,520
It has no multiplier right now.

3400
03:18:13,100 --> 03:18:15,060
We'll start it later.

3401
03:18:15,060 --> 03:18:15,140
Later.

3402
03:18:20,470 --> 03:18:22,790
Actually, I probably should have tried to get a five of a kind.

3403
03:18:23,070 --> 03:18:23,570
You know what?

3404
03:18:23,670 --> 03:18:23,890
Whatever.

3405
03:18:25,950 --> 03:18:26,390
One,

3406
03:18:31,750 --> 03:18:33,530
two, three, four, five.

3407
03:18:36,570 --> 03:18:37,010
Wait.

3408
03:18:37,390 --> 03:18:38,650
Is this not a...

3409
03:18:38,650 --> 03:18:39,770
Oh, there's no seven.

3410
03:18:39,970 --> 03:18:40,390
Just kidding.

3411
03:18:42,010 --> 03:18:42,450
Wow.

3412
03:18:42,770 --> 03:18:43,470
Ace doko.

3413
03:18:43,670 --> 03:18:44,130
Is that right?

3414
03:18:45,490 --> 03:18:46,870
Put the... Oh, put this...

3415
03:18:48,410 --> 03:18:48,850
Here?

3416
03:19:00,780 --> 03:19:01,260
Flush.

3417
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:02,500
No.

3418
03:19:04,240 --> 03:19:04,840
Oh, I do?

3419
03:19:08,630 --> 03:19:09,110
No.

3420
03:19:10,210 --> 03:19:11,850
This is like...

3421
03:19:13,690 --> 03:19:15,030
I guess two pair.

3422
03:19:16,270 --> 03:19:17,730
And then I'm just gonna throw in the two.

3423
03:19:24,240 --> 03:19:25,400
This is so awkward.

3424
03:19:25,940 --> 03:19:26,740
Make a steal card.

3425
03:19:26,980 --> 03:19:27,600
Hold on!

3426
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:28,360
There we go.

3427
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:30,020
Now I will make a steal card.

3428
03:19:32,180 --> 03:19:32,660
Use.

3429
03:19:33,560 --> 03:19:34,400
There we go.

3430
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:37,660
Okay, I'm gonna throw a bunch of things away.

3431
03:19:37,920 --> 03:19:39,020
Three, four, five.

3432
03:19:39,620 --> 03:19:39,960
Goodbye.

3433
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:43,840
One, two, three, four, five!

3434
03:19:46,560 --> 03:19:47,720
That's a win, baby.

3435
03:19:48,120 --> 03:19:49,160
That's a win, baby.

3436
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:50,840
That's a win, baby.

3437
03:19:59,580 --> 03:20:03,720
Oh, the steal cards need to be in your hand?

3438
03:20:03,720 --> 03:20:04,320
Oh wait.

3439
03:20:04,480 --> 03:20:07,120
No, I thought the steal cards were...

3440
03:20:07,120 --> 03:20:07,340
Oh.

3441
03:20:08,580 --> 03:20:09,100
Oopsie.

3442
03:20:11,300 --> 03:20:12,120
It's fine.

3443
03:20:15,520 --> 03:20:17,600
Every played card counts in scoring.

3444
03:20:17,740 --> 03:20:18,420
What does that mean?

3445
03:20:19,520 --> 03:20:20,260
One in two chance.

3446
03:20:20,400 --> 03:20:20,540
Okay.

3447
03:20:20,780 --> 03:20:20,940
Wait.

3448
03:20:21,660 --> 03:20:23,140
I can use this now, right?

3449
03:20:25,280 --> 03:20:26,300
Full house.

3450
03:20:26,840 --> 03:20:27,100
Okay.

3451
03:20:28,120 --> 03:20:28,520
Use.

3452
03:20:28,620 --> 03:20:28,840
Whatever.

3453
03:20:31,780 --> 03:20:32,600
Four of a kind.

3454
03:20:32,600 --> 03:20:33,660
Nice.

3455
03:20:35,180 --> 03:20:36,660
Nice, nice, nice.

3456
03:20:37,200 --> 03:20:38,100
That's actually good.

3457
03:20:44,420 --> 03:20:47,060
Any of these cards are better than baseball.

3458
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:49,320
Maybe.

3459
03:20:54,230 --> 03:20:54,850
Reroll.

3460
03:21:06,220 --> 03:21:07,060
Sayonara.

3461
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:08,200
Joker, maybe.

3462
03:21:08,660 --> 03:21:09,160
Baseball.

3463
03:21:09,760 --> 03:21:10,300
Reroll!

3464
03:21:11,560 --> 03:21:12,620
Not worth, really.

3465
03:21:14,140 --> 03:21:15,820
But it's plus ten multiplier.

3466
03:21:17,840 --> 03:21:18,200
It's...

3467
03:21:19,640 --> 03:21:20,220
Okay.

3468
03:21:21,600 --> 03:21:22,240
What the?

3469
03:21:22,400 --> 03:21:23,040
Oh, scary.

3470
03:21:24,220 --> 03:21:25,680
Booster pack is skipped.

3471
03:21:29,620 --> 03:21:30,700
Glass card.

3472
03:21:31,480 --> 03:21:33,020
I don't like the glass card.

3473
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:33,480
It's scary.

3474
03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:38,680
Doesn't fit your build, I guess.

3475
03:21:41,140 --> 03:21:42,780
Red isn't good this late.

3476
03:21:42,940 --> 03:21:43,600
Okay, reroll.

3477
03:21:44,500 --> 03:21:47,140
Adds double the rank of lowest rank card.

3478
03:21:48,640 --> 03:21:48,880
No.

3479
03:21:50,260 --> 03:21:50,720
Flush.

3480
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:51,420
Was it flush?

3481
03:21:51,560 --> 03:21:52,060
Sorry, I checked.

3482
03:21:52,620 --> 03:21:53,460
Same suit.

3483
03:21:55,740 --> 03:22:00,560
I feel like flush does suit my thing, because I have a lot of aces that are...

3484
03:22:00,560 --> 03:22:02,280
I guess it doesn't...

3485
03:22:02,280 --> 03:22:03,600
I guess it's not the best, though.

3486
03:22:04,480 --> 03:22:04,940
Reroll!

3487
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:05,780
Reroll one more time.

3488
03:22:16,840 --> 03:22:17,500
One more.

3489
03:22:18,700 --> 03:22:19,600
Oh.

3490
03:22:20,640 --> 03:22:22,660
Creates a random joker card.

3491
03:22:25,660 --> 03:22:26,560
No.

3492
03:22:39,040 --> 03:22:41,160
Sell the baseball and gamble?

3493
03:22:45,030 --> 03:22:45,930
Okay.

3494
03:22:48,170 --> 03:22:49,550
Why the hell not?

3495
03:22:50,230 --> 03:22:51,390
I love a good gamble.

3496
03:23:03,970 --> 03:23:07,150
Cards drawn face down after each hand played.

3497
03:23:08,190 --> 03:23:08,750
Scary.

3498
03:23:12,470 --> 03:23:13,030
Scary!

3499
03:23:26,350 --> 03:23:28,370
I want to play this.

3500
03:23:30,970 --> 03:23:34,250
But I think, actually, I will get rid of everything.

3501
03:23:36,570 --> 03:23:40,750
Wait, yeah, I think... I'm too afraid to pull cards face down.

3502
03:23:41,430 --> 03:23:43,110
I think I should fish instead.

3503
03:23:44,130 --> 03:23:45,790
I don't think it would be worth it.

3504
03:23:45,790 --> 03:23:46,790
1, 2, 3, 4...

3505
03:23:46,790 --> 03:23:48,790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

3506
03:23:48,950 --> 03:23:49,930
I don't think it's worth it.

3507
03:23:50,890 --> 03:23:51,950
I think I should fish.

3508
03:23:53,090 --> 03:23:54,070
I think I should fish.

3509
03:23:55,250 --> 03:23:56,250
There we go!

3510
03:23:56,950 --> 03:23:58,950
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

3511
03:24:02,980 --> 03:24:04,200
I'm still gonna fish.

3512
03:24:04,660 --> 03:24:06,180
I'm gonna fish for the steelies.

3513
03:24:07,280 --> 03:24:08,040
There we go!

3514
03:24:09,420 --> 03:24:10,260
There we go!

3515
03:24:12,660 --> 03:24:14,800
A whole hand of aces!

3516
03:24:20,760 --> 03:24:23,600
Okay, we got at least one steelie.

3517
03:24:25,400 --> 03:24:26,700
Eight of a kind.

3518
03:24:27,640 --> 03:24:28,160
I know.

3519
03:24:28,340 --> 03:24:30,600
2, 3, 4, 5.

3520
03:24:31,820 --> 03:24:32,580
That should be good.

3521
03:24:46,180 --> 03:24:47,720
Almost a flush 5 too.

3522
03:24:47,820 --> 03:24:48,500
I know, right?

3523
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:50,060
So close.

3524
03:24:50,800 --> 03:24:52,840
We didn't even have to worry about the face down.

3525
03:24:53,600 --> 03:24:54,660
We cashed out.

3526
03:24:55,360 --> 03:24:55,860
Planet cards.

3527
03:24:56,360 --> 03:24:56,680
Nice.

3528
03:24:56,960 --> 03:24:57,600
Planet cards.

3529
03:24:59,620 --> 03:25:00,700
Mint woe is me.

3530
03:25:00,760 --> 03:25:01,520
I'm so cursed phantom.

3531
03:25:01,620 --> 03:25:02,600
What are you talking about?

3532
03:25:02,680 --> 03:25:04,000
Mega celestial pack.

3533
03:25:04,300 --> 03:25:06,040
Let's get it.

3534
03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:08,640
Pick two.

3535
03:25:09,520 --> 03:25:11,960
Pair, two pair, high card.

3536
03:25:12,100 --> 03:25:13,060
I still think that one is good.

3537
03:25:14,040 --> 03:25:15,380
Four of a kind and a high card.

3538
03:25:15,520 --> 03:25:15,680
Okay.

3539
03:25:16,420 --> 03:25:16,780
Perfect.

3540
03:25:22,780 --> 03:25:23,220
Nice.

3541
03:25:23,220 --> 03:25:27,420
That means four of a kind is a big money.

3542
03:25:28,700 --> 03:25:30,580
But still my five of a kind is stronger.

3543
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:36,060
Four dollars of poker hand is three of a kind.

3544
03:25:39,810 --> 03:25:40,390
Two pair.

3545
03:25:51,740 --> 03:25:52,700
Bonus cards.

3546
03:25:53,820 --> 03:25:55,740
Destroys two selected cards.

3547
03:25:56,880 --> 03:25:57,940
More money.

3548
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:07,700
I don't know which one to do.

3549
03:26:16,060 --> 03:26:16,420
Hangman.

3550
03:26:16,580 --> 03:26:18,900
I was thinking that too to kind of thin out the deck.

3551
03:26:21,080 --> 03:26:23,760
Because we have the bus stop, I feel we should get rid of these.

3552
03:26:28,550 --> 03:26:30,030
Get rid of our face cards.

3553
03:26:33,370 --> 03:26:34,410
Sayonara face cards.

3554
03:26:37,810 --> 03:26:38,510
And re-roll.

3555
03:26:39,430 --> 03:26:41,230
Plus one hand side.

3556
03:26:48,110 --> 03:26:49,630
Re-roll.

3557
03:26:52,090 --> 03:26:55,550
Create a tarot card if poker hand contains...

3558
03:26:56,350 --> 03:26:56,730
Wait.

3559
03:26:57,130 --> 03:26:58,370
Ace and a straight.

3560
03:26:59,170 --> 03:26:59,490
No.

3561
03:27:01,050 --> 03:27:01,810
Blueprint.

3562
03:27:02,230 --> 03:27:02,930
Wait, this one?

3563
03:27:03,370 --> 03:27:05,530
Copies ability of Joker to the right.

3564
03:27:07,270 --> 03:27:08,470
Blueprint is crazy.

3565
03:27:09,190 --> 03:27:11,490
So I guess we sell the golden Joker.

3566
03:27:12,150 --> 03:27:13,490
Bye bye golden Joker.

3567
03:27:16,750 --> 03:27:17,990
Wait, copy the banana.

3568
03:27:19,870 --> 03:27:20,490
I thought you... Sorry.

3569
03:27:25,090 --> 03:27:25,610
Compatible.

3570
03:27:26,810 --> 03:27:28,030
They are compatible.

3571
03:27:29,070 --> 03:27:30,610
Look at the way he is looking at that banana.

3572
03:27:30,610 --> 03:27:32,830
I decided to play alongside with you, Minky.

3573
03:27:33,230 --> 03:27:34,610
On a seated run.

3574
03:27:36,410 --> 03:27:37,250
Seated Minky.

3575
03:27:37,550 --> 03:27:39,870
For the Wisps that know this game, I have Bloodstone.

3576
03:27:40,090 --> 03:27:40,250
Oops.

3577
03:27:40,630 --> 03:27:43,310
All sixes, Blueprint and Showman with other Jokers.

3578
03:27:43,410 --> 03:27:44,170
I'm on ante-eleven.

3579
03:27:47,410 --> 03:27:47,830
Please.

3580
03:27:49,830 --> 03:27:50,490
What is this game?

3581
03:27:50,530 --> 03:27:51,210
I've seen it everywhere.

3582
03:27:51,290 --> 03:27:51,990
It's Bellatio.

3583
03:27:55,670 --> 03:27:56,090
OK.

3584
03:27:56,790 --> 03:27:58,090
So, to the right.

3585
03:27:58,170 --> 03:27:58,350
OK.

3586
03:28:01,980 --> 03:28:02,380
Wait.

3587
03:28:02,500 --> 03:28:04,460
Copy DNA for the first hand and move it.

3588
03:28:06,500 --> 03:28:06,980
Wait.

3589
03:28:07,140 --> 03:28:07,720
Is that possible?

3590
03:28:07,880 --> 03:28:08,100
Wait.

3591
03:28:08,200 --> 03:28:09,180
How does that even work?

3592
03:28:10,660 --> 03:28:12,380
How does it even work?

3593
03:28:15,780 --> 03:28:16,900
So like this?

3594
03:28:28,830 --> 03:28:30,390
And then move it in between.

3595
03:28:31,010 --> 03:28:31,990
Oh my god.

3596
03:28:32,830 --> 03:28:33,810
Oh my god.

3597
03:28:35,490 --> 03:28:36,470
Can move each hand.

3598
03:28:37,810 --> 03:28:38,290
Wait.

3599
03:28:38,290 --> 03:28:38,350
OK.

3600
03:28:42,840 --> 03:28:43,700
I'm going fishing.

3601
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:50,760
Fishing.

3602
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:52,440
Damn.

3603
03:28:52,660 --> 03:28:53,800
One, two, three, four.

3604
03:28:54,500 --> 03:28:55,420
Four of a kind is so good.

3605
03:29:23,410 --> 03:29:24,370
Holy cow.

3606
03:29:25,430 --> 03:29:26,190
Plus two chips.

3607
03:29:27,550 --> 03:29:28,250
Oh, blue Joker.

3608
03:29:29,030 --> 03:29:30,630
Hundred chips, evasion, tend to strike.

3609
03:29:38,060 --> 03:29:39,680
Converge three of the hearts.

3610
03:29:40,480 --> 03:29:41,960
Creates two random planets.

3611
03:29:42,440 --> 03:29:43,260
Let's do the planets.

3612
03:29:46,020 --> 03:29:46,760
Let's see Uranus.

3613
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:47,580
Two pair.

3614
03:29:47,980 --> 03:29:48,420
Flush.

3615
03:29:49,160 --> 03:29:49,720
Boo.

3616
03:29:56,860 --> 03:30:01,440
It's good to have multipliers, I guess.

3617
03:30:02,340 --> 03:30:02,820
Re-roll.

3618
03:30:03,280 --> 03:30:04,880
Oh, high card.

3619
03:30:05,080 --> 03:30:05,800
Yeah, baby.

3620
03:30:08,440 --> 03:30:11,040
Oh, I think my chat froze.

3621
03:30:11,160 --> 03:30:11,500
Hold on.

3622
03:30:11,600 --> 03:30:12,220
One second, guys.

3623
03:30:14,860 --> 03:30:15,800
One second.

3624
03:30:20,960 --> 03:30:22,040
Akira, welcome back.

3625
03:30:22,080 --> 03:30:22,520
Thank you.

3626
03:30:23,860 --> 03:30:24,480
One second.

3627
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:26,180
Hold on.

3628
03:30:27,700 --> 03:30:28,240
Testing.

3629
03:30:28,580 --> 03:30:30,180
I see you only on OBS.

3630
03:30:30,460 --> 03:30:34,480
Let me get you on my...

3631
03:30:34,480 --> 03:30:38,300
I can't read you through OBS as well.

3632
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:45,160
Look at how small that Joker is.

3633
03:30:45,460 --> 03:30:46,260
Minto Joker.

3634
03:30:48,540 --> 03:30:50,100
What the heck is that?

3635
03:30:50,920 --> 03:30:54,740
Joker gains plus four chips if played hand has exactly four cards.

3636
03:30:57,380 --> 03:30:57,700
Okay.

3637
03:31:01,160 --> 03:31:03,100
I'm gonna re-roll one more time.

3638
03:31:03,740 --> 03:31:04,580
I don't wanna...

3639
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:07,340
Nice.

3640
03:31:10,200 --> 03:31:11,660
Open the Joker pack?

3641
03:31:12,820 --> 03:31:14,760
But I like my guys.

3642
03:31:20,020 --> 03:31:21,520
What do you think about this game?

3643
03:31:21,620 --> 03:31:22,400
Would you recommend it?

3644
03:31:22,940 --> 03:31:24,240
Yeah, I like it.

3645
03:31:24,820 --> 03:31:25,520
What if it's a negative?

3646
03:31:26,920 --> 03:31:27,760
Okay, fair.

3647
03:31:31,570 --> 03:31:32,670
No negative.

3648
03:31:34,850 --> 03:31:35,410
Flush.

3649
03:31:36,610 --> 03:31:37,830
Three or fewer cards.

3650
03:31:37,890 --> 03:31:37,890
No.

3651
03:31:39,390 --> 03:31:39,670
No.

3652
03:31:42,170 --> 03:31:43,490
Skip-a-skip-a.

3653
03:31:44,230 --> 03:31:45,310
Skip-a-skip-a.

3654
03:31:46,650 --> 03:31:47,830
Skip-a-skip-a.

3655
03:31:49,290 --> 03:31:50,830
I think we're good for...

3656
03:31:52,730 --> 03:31:53,630
This, right?

3657
03:32:04,610 --> 03:32:06,330
Okay, I thought we were on the boss.

3658
03:32:06,390 --> 03:32:06,850
Oh my gosh.

3659
03:32:07,270 --> 03:32:09,230
Forces one card to always be selected.

3660
03:32:10,310 --> 03:32:12,090
That one's gonna be...

3661
03:32:12,090 --> 03:32:12,490
Icky.

3662
03:32:17,560 --> 03:32:17,960
Nice.

3663
03:32:21,620 --> 03:32:22,180
Wait.

3664
03:32:22,660 --> 03:32:23,040
DNA.

3665
03:32:24,500 --> 03:32:25,060
Play.

3666
03:32:25,060 --> 03:32:25,120
Play.

3667
03:32:33,940 --> 03:32:35,700
Then, go fish!

3668
03:32:38,540 --> 03:32:39,460
Not enough.

3669
03:32:39,560 --> 03:32:39,980
Go fish.

3670
03:32:45,700 --> 03:32:46,700
Go fish.

3671
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:54,540
One, two, three, four, five.

3672
03:32:55,860 --> 03:32:57,100
There are five of a kind.

3673
03:32:58,220 --> 03:32:58,420
Yeah.

3674
03:32:58,420 --> 03:32:58,460
Yeah.

3675
03:33:02,560 --> 03:33:03,960
This

3676
03:33:15,700 --> 03:33:20,000
is disgusting egregious amount of cash.

3677
03:33:22,040 --> 03:33:23,940
This is disgusting.

3678
03:33:28,980 --> 03:33:30,120
Tarot card.

3679
03:33:39,550 --> 03:33:42,110
I've never seen this one before.

3680
03:33:43,730 --> 03:33:45,550
I've never seen this one before.

3681
03:33:45,810 --> 03:33:47,950
I've never seen a legendary joker before.

3682
03:33:49,970 --> 03:33:50,710
What should I?

3683
03:33:50,790 --> 03:33:51,170
What should I?

3684
03:33:51,230 --> 03:33:51,670
What should I?

3685
03:33:52,790 --> 03:33:53,990
I don't have room.

3686
03:34:01,310 --> 03:34:01,770
DNA.

3687
03:34:02,190 --> 03:34:03,650
Is it time to get rid of DNA?

3688
03:34:06,010 --> 03:34:07,430
I think it might be time.

3689
03:34:08,730 --> 03:34:10,130
It's time to sell DNA.

3690
03:34:16,980 --> 03:34:17,440
Play.

3691
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:25,620
It doesn't work for my hand.

3692
03:34:38,800 --> 03:34:40,680
It doesn't work for my hand.

3693
03:34:42,900 --> 03:34:43,420
No.

3694
03:34:44,940 --> 03:34:46,100
We got scammed.

3695
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:49,720
We got scammed.

3696
03:34:51,020 --> 03:34:53,980
The best soul but the wrong deck.

3697
03:35:05,920 --> 03:35:09,540
I mean, we could get rid of the boss.

3698
03:35:10,540 --> 03:35:14,980
We could get rid of the boss.

3699
03:35:17,860 --> 03:35:18,720
Honestly.

3700
03:35:20,020 --> 03:35:20,780
Keep the boss.

3701
03:35:20,900 --> 03:35:21,800
You have aces.

3702
03:35:29,860 --> 03:35:32,020
You have an ace filled deck.

3703
03:35:32,840 --> 03:35:33,760
Sell the legend.

3704
03:35:35,940 --> 03:35:36,620
The legend.

3705
03:35:40,020 --> 03:35:40,880
Okay.

3706
03:35:41,720 --> 03:35:42,580
Sayonara.

3707
03:35:43,440 --> 03:35:44,920
It hurts.

3708
03:35:46,720 --> 03:35:48,780
I've never gotten a legendary.

3709
03:35:49,900 --> 03:35:50,700
Hold on.

3710
03:35:50,760 --> 03:35:51,820
I'm going to open this real quick.

3711
03:35:55,720 --> 03:35:56,360
Okay.

3712
03:35:57,300 --> 03:35:57,600
Skip.

3713
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:03,940
Plus one tarot.

3714
03:36:04,200 --> 03:36:05,320
Multi per tarot card.

3715
03:36:05,360 --> 03:36:06,080
Use this run.

3716
03:36:11,260 --> 03:36:12,420
Plus 15.

3717
03:36:13,580 --> 03:36:15,180
Plus 15 is alright.

3718
03:36:15,480 --> 03:36:15,760
Yeah.

3719
03:36:16,460 --> 03:36:17,540
It's not bad.

3720
03:36:20,920 --> 03:36:22,140
It's not bad.

3721
03:36:23,820 --> 03:36:24,980
Not the worst.

3722
03:36:26,940 --> 03:36:28,360
We could get it for now.

3723
03:36:29,620 --> 03:36:31,340
I don't want to keep re-rolling.

3724
03:36:31,800 --> 03:36:32,600
Buy then re-roll?

3725
03:36:32,880 --> 03:36:33,120
Okay.

3726
03:36:33,260 --> 03:36:33,380
Yeah.

3727
03:36:33,420 --> 03:36:33,940
That's a good idea.

3728
03:36:34,180 --> 03:36:34,280
Yeah.

3729
03:36:34,340 --> 03:36:36,020
We buy and then re-roll is a good idea.

3730
03:36:38,100 --> 03:36:39,940
Creates up to two random tarot cards.

3731
03:36:40,740 --> 03:36:41,340
Why not?

3732
03:36:44,140 --> 03:36:44,800
What the?

3733
03:36:48,380 --> 03:36:49,260
Two planets.

3734
03:36:50,820 --> 03:36:51,260
Okay.

3735
03:36:51,260 --> 03:36:52,220
These are good.

3736
03:36:54,420 --> 03:36:55,260
You know what?

3737
03:36:58,180 --> 03:36:59,320
Let's stick with it for now.

3738
03:37:00,140 --> 03:37:01,080
Let's stick with it for now.

3739
03:37:02,020 --> 03:37:03,800
This actually has a higher...

3740
03:37:04,360 --> 03:37:04,940
This... Wait.

3741
03:37:05,960 --> 03:37:06,400
No.

3742
03:37:06,600 --> 03:37:07,340
I was thinking of this.

3743
03:37:07,460 --> 03:37:10,260
It does have a higher than the bus driver.

3744
03:37:12,280 --> 03:37:12,720
Alright.

3745
03:37:12,800 --> 03:37:13,240
Next round.

3746
03:37:14,140 --> 03:37:15,000
I forgot.

3747
03:37:15,540 --> 03:37:16,380
We're on the bus.

3748
03:37:21,310 --> 03:37:22,290
Do you think I'll be okay?

3749
03:37:22,470 --> 03:37:24,070
Force one card to always be selected?

3750
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:32,000
Yeah.

3751
03:37:32,080 --> 03:37:32,680
You'll be good.

3752
03:37:38,140 --> 03:37:38,620
Nice.

3753
03:37:39,640 --> 03:37:39,760
Okay.

3754
03:37:39,780 --> 03:37:40,500
Let me do this.

3755
03:37:40,960 --> 03:37:41,420
Use... Wait.

3756
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:41,720
No.

3757
03:37:43,540 --> 03:37:44,020
Wait.

3758
03:37:44,680 --> 03:37:45,640
Can I use this?

3759
03:37:47,060 --> 03:37:48,020
I can't.

3760
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:49,880
Because the one card is always selected.

3761
03:37:49,880 --> 03:37:50,920
Oh shoot.

3762
03:37:51,860 --> 03:37:53,740
I don't want to use my lucky card.

3763
03:37:55,320 --> 03:37:56,260
Fish for aces.

3764
03:37:56,580 --> 03:37:56,580
Yeah.

3765
03:38:02,320 --> 03:38:04,580
I have to do this, I think.

3766
03:38:04,980 --> 03:38:06,400
I think I have to do the full house.

3767
03:38:08,400 --> 03:38:09,660
Let's do the full house.

3768
03:38:09,660 --> 03:38:09,700
Yes.

3769
03:38:34,780 --> 03:38:35,820
Keep going.

3770
03:38:41,100 --> 03:38:44,500
Like I said, my last... The last one I did.

3771
03:38:46,100 --> 03:38:46,840
Permanent again.

3772
03:38:47,160 --> 03:38:47,500
Oh.

3773
03:38:47,700 --> 03:38:47,920
Nice.

3774
03:38:47,960 --> 03:38:48,260
Thank you.

3775
03:38:49,380 --> 03:38:52,480
We went... Like I said, I died at the 7 million mark.

3776
03:38:54,160 --> 03:38:58,400
We gotta use this to be able to... Oh, I... Wait.

3777
03:38:58,480 --> 03:38:58,620
Yeah.

3778
03:38:58,680 --> 03:38:59,620
We can use this immediately.

3779
03:39:02,060 --> 03:39:02,700
Mars.

3780
03:39:02,840 --> 03:39:03,320
Pluto!

3781
03:39:07,440 --> 03:39:09,660
I think Mars is better.

3782
03:39:13,500 --> 03:39:14,820
We'll do the Mars.

3783
03:39:23,120 --> 03:39:25,760
Enhances one into a wild card.

3784
03:39:28,360 --> 03:39:29,160
Oh yeah.

3785
03:39:29,280 --> 03:39:30,060
Let's open this too.

3786
03:39:34,240 --> 03:39:34,840
Wait.

3787
03:39:35,140 --> 03:39:35,720
Can I use this?

3788
03:39:36,180 --> 03:39:37,100
I can!

3789
03:39:37,480 --> 03:39:38,040
Oh my god.

3790
03:39:38,180 --> 03:39:38,820
No way.

3791
03:39:39,580 --> 03:39:40,220
Big news.

3792
03:39:41,180 --> 03:39:43,300
Enhances two into bonus cards.

3793
03:39:45,880 --> 03:39:46,900
Is this money?

3794
03:39:47,160 --> 03:39:47,920
Free money!

3795
03:39:51,500 --> 03:39:52,880
Death is pretty good here.

3796
03:39:52,980 --> 03:39:53,980
Selected two... Ah!

3797
03:39:54,680 --> 03:39:55,280
True.

3798
03:39:58,980 --> 03:40:00,520
Do the king and steal?

3799
03:40:04,440 --> 03:40:06,800
I could, I mean... Steal the king?

3800
03:40:08,220 --> 03:40:08,660
Really?

3801
03:40:09,100 --> 03:40:09,620
Like him?

3802
03:40:14,400 --> 03:40:16,120
Turn the king into a lucky ace.

3803
03:40:16,240 --> 03:40:17,100
Oh, we could do that too!

3804
03:40:17,300 --> 03:40:18,100
We could do that too.

3805
03:40:21,380 --> 03:40:23,080
There's several things we could do here.

3806
03:40:24,960 --> 03:40:26,580
This doesn't look like the sims.

3807
03:40:26,740 --> 03:40:27,040
Ah!

3808
03:40:27,120 --> 03:40:28,600
Look at pinned message please!

3809
03:40:30,740 --> 03:40:32,600
Please read the pinned message.

3810
03:40:34,660 --> 03:40:36,980
Steal the king because you'll never play faces.

3811
03:40:37,420 --> 03:40:37,720
True.

3812
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:42,100
That's so true.

3813
03:40:42,460 --> 03:40:43,680
That's so, so true.

3814
03:40:44,280 --> 03:40:49,120
And then, we can do...

3815
03:40:57,480 --> 03:40:58,740
Wait, what am I doing?

3816
03:40:58,740 --> 03:41:01,740
I... I...

3817
03:41:04,020 --> 03:41:06,740
I'm going to turn...

3818
03:41:07,820 --> 03:41:11,620
Wait, so turns the left card into the right card.

3819
03:41:15,590 --> 03:41:16,230
Nice.

3820
03:41:16,450 --> 03:41:16,630
Okay.

3821
03:41:20,600 --> 03:41:23,260
Since we did the steal, and now let's use this.

3822
03:41:28,360 --> 03:41:29,000
Straight...

3823
03:41:31,520 --> 03:41:33,340
The hand I never use.

3824
03:41:33,540 --> 03:41:33,920
Flush.

3825
03:41:37,020 --> 03:41:37,940
What's a flush again?

3826
03:41:38,740 --> 03:41:41,380
Five cards that share the same suit?

3827
03:41:41,700 --> 03:41:43,520
We can still get that, because...

3828
03:41:45,360 --> 03:41:47,640
But I think the four of a kind trumps it.

3829
03:41:48,800 --> 03:41:52,960
Or the five, if we had five of a kind, it would trump it.

3830
03:41:53,140 --> 03:41:53,560
But that's okay.

3831
03:41:55,500 --> 03:41:57,300
Enhances one into a wild card.

3832
03:41:57,580 --> 03:41:58,680
In fact, I'm going to buy this.

3833
03:42:00,460 --> 03:42:01,560
And re-roll.

3834
03:42:02,760 --> 03:42:03,400
A pair.

3835
03:42:05,680 --> 03:42:06,300
Why not?

3836
03:42:08,440 --> 03:42:09,660
Why not?

3837
03:42:09,760 --> 03:42:10,640
We have money.

3838
03:42:14,700 --> 03:42:15,380
Re-roll.

3839
03:42:16,440 --> 03:42:17,920
That's why we re-roll.

3840
03:42:19,940 --> 03:42:21,500
That's why we re-roll.

3841
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:24,300
Build your tarot.

3842
03:42:24,660 --> 03:42:25,440
Yeah, exactly.

3843
03:42:27,120 --> 03:42:28,100
Okay, let's go.

3844
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:30,000
Select.

3845
03:42:33,980 --> 03:42:38,080
In fact, let's turn this guy into a wild card.

3846
03:42:39,460 --> 03:42:40,080
There we go.

3847
03:42:41,280 --> 03:42:45,320
Four of a kind... Wait, our four of a kind is kind of insane right now.

3848
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:49,960
Go fish, though.

3849
03:42:54,920 --> 03:42:58,040
We almost have five of a... We almost have a five flush.

3850
03:43:03,220 --> 03:43:03,860
Go fish.

3851
03:43:08,100 --> 03:43:08,860
Go fish.

3852
03:43:16,580 --> 03:43:18,480
I think I'm just going to play it.

3853
03:43:19,080 --> 03:43:19,440
It's okay.

3854
03:43:21,480 --> 03:43:22,420
Go fish again?

3855
03:43:22,600 --> 03:43:23,640
No, it's okay, it's okay.

3856
03:43:24,700 --> 03:43:25,320
It's okay!

3857
03:43:27,920 --> 03:43:28,880
We win!

3858
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:32,000
Greedy man.

3859
03:43:32,440 --> 03:43:33,300
Oh yeah.

3860
03:43:33,560 --> 03:43:34,560
Wait, I got a voucher.

3861
03:43:35,800 --> 03:43:36,520
I am greedy.

3862
03:43:36,520 --> 03:43:36,600
Greedy.

3863
03:43:38,820 --> 03:43:40,300
I am a little bit.

3864
03:43:41,760 --> 03:43:42,460
I'm going to buy.

3865
03:43:43,860 --> 03:43:45,800
I know it's just for a pair, but whatever.

3866
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:47,540
You never know.

3867
03:43:47,820 --> 03:43:48,180
Arcana.

3868
03:43:50,900 --> 03:43:53,080
I think getting planets is like worth the money.

3869
03:43:54,200 --> 03:43:55,520
Select three into hearts.

3870
03:43:56,600 --> 03:43:57,980
Two to lucky cards.

3871
03:44:00,520 --> 03:44:02,540
Two to multi-card.

3872
03:44:11,260 --> 03:44:13,800
Glass cards are great for your five aces.

3873
03:44:14,160 --> 03:44:15,480
But they might break.

3874
03:44:19,060 --> 03:44:20,780
Make one card lucky.

3875
03:44:33,440 --> 03:44:35,520
Multi is better than lucky.

3876
03:44:35,700 --> 03:44:36,080
It's okay.

3877
03:44:39,300 --> 03:44:42,980
But one in four chance to destroy it, you guys.

3878
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:46,560
Without DNA, glass is so scary.

3879
03:44:46,940 --> 03:44:49,200
If we had DNA, it would be great.

3880
03:44:53,400 --> 03:44:54,620
High priestess.

3881
03:44:56,540 --> 03:44:58,980
I'm going to do the priestess, I think.

3882
03:44:59,820 --> 03:45:04,940
I think trying to level up poker hands is important.

3883
03:45:07,180 --> 03:45:07,840
Emperor.

3884
03:45:08,380 --> 03:45:10,340
Creates up to two random tarot cards.

3885
03:45:11,600 --> 03:45:13,380
The emperor defeated the joker.

3886
03:45:13,540 --> 03:45:14,420
You're so right.

3887
03:45:15,560 --> 03:45:16,500
You're right, okay.

3888
03:45:18,780 --> 03:45:20,460
We get free money!

3889
03:45:30,310 --> 03:45:32,430
I'm going to hold off on the glass card.

3890
03:45:32,550 --> 03:45:35,490
I know you guys are like, get it, but I'm going to hold off.

3891
03:45:38,390 --> 03:45:40,390
Two cards to bonus cards.

3892
03:45:40,390 --> 03:45:42,410
Today is your lucky day.

3893
03:45:43,670 --> 03:45:43,890
Bonus!

3894
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:47,550
This card.

3895
03:45:49,490 --> 03:45:50,390
One more.

3896
03:45:51,210 --> 03:45:52,470
I could do the four of a kind.

3897
03:45:56,390 --> 03:45:57,390
Like so.

3898
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:20,220
I'm starting to get sleepy.

3899
03:46:20,420 --> 03:46:22,600
Oh my gosh, I just realized it's almost been four hours.

3900
03:46:24,780 --> 03:46:26,840
We're about to hit the boss, aren't we?

3901
03:46:29,040 --> 03:46:33,620
Yeah, let's do the boss and then we'll... No repeat hand types this round.

3902
03:46:38,120 --> 03:46:38,600
Okay.

3903
03:46:44,980 --> 03:46:46,220
Just one shot it.

3904
03:46:46,280 --> 03:46:48,020
Yeah, we'll just one shot it, actually.

3905
03:46:53,640 --> 03:46:56,260
Dang it, I don't have room.

3906
03:46:59,420 --> 03:47:02,060
One five of a kind wins anyway.

3907
03:47:03,200 --> 03:47:03,560
True.

3908
03:47:05,780 --> 03:47:06,920
I can't do judgment.

3909
03:47:08,840 --> 03:47:10,980
But I wanted to feed the fortune teller.

3910
03:47:16,480 --> 03:47:18,200
Judgment can make negatives.

3911
03:47:19,360 --> 03:47:20,140
That's two bucks.

3912
03:47:26,070 --> 03:47:28,890
I don't want to... It wouldn't kick out one of my jokers, right?

3913
03:47:31,030 --> 03:47:36,610
So if it creates a negative... If the very lucky chance it creates a negative, then we just get an extra card.

3914
03:47:40,770 --> 03:47:41,950
We need room.

3915
03:47:42,190 --> 03:47:44,330
Yeah, so...

3916
03:47:46,260 --> 03:47:47,720
You still need the space.

3917
03:47:50,940 --> 03:47:52,720
You can't use it unless you have space.

3918
03:47:52,840 --> 03:47:53,180
Oh, really?

3919
03:48:01,100 --> 03:48:01,580
Straight.

3920
03:48:03,820 --> 03:48:05,340
I'll never use a straight.

3921
03:48:06,940 --> 03:48:08,280
I'll never use straight.

3922
03:48:09,100 --> 03:48:10,080
But I will still buy.

3923
03:48:12,880 --> 03:48:15,580
I lost on the minky seed by gambling with the joker.

3924
03:48:15,800 --> 03:48:17,840
I posted a screenshot of my ranomito live.

3925
03:48:18,240 --> 03:48:19,120
Oh, go check it out.

3926
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:19,400
It's a person.

3927
03:48:22,760 --> 03:48:23,800
Reboot!

3928
03:48:23,960 --> 03:48:25,480
This is scary.

3929
03:48:27,300 --> 03:48:29,780
Play face cards get 30...

3930
03:48:31,660 --> 03:48:32,700
Reboot.

3931
03:48:34,500 --> 03:48:35,380
You know what?

3932
03:48:35,860 --> 03:48:36,340
Sure.

3933
03:48:39,760 --> 03:48:41,300
Demon joker.

3934
03:48:46,700 --> 03:48:49,160
Creates the last tarot...

3935
03:48:50,720 --> 03:48:52,160
Planet card used...

3936
03:48:55,560 --> 03:48:56,460
Just buy...

3937
03:48:56,760 --> 03:48:57,640
And hold.

3938
03:48:57,960 --> 03:48:58,980
Buy and hold.

3939
03:48:59,440 --> 03:49:00,500
I'm gonna go in.

3940
03:49:01,080 --> 03:49:01,840
I'm going in!

3941
03:49:11,420 --> 03:49:13,460
1, 2, 3, 4...

3942
03:49:13,460 --> 03:49:14,260
We need one more.

3943
03:49:18,500 --> 03:49:21,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

3944
03:49:27,600 --> 03:49:28,220
Dang it.

3945
03:49:28,320 --> 03:49:29,460
I was trying for a steely.

3946
03:49:30,140 --> 03:49:31,040
Try for the steely!

3947
03:49:33,160 --> 03:49:33,820
Dang it.

3948
03:49:33,960 --> 03:49:34,780
Okay, nevermind.

3949
03:49:45,360 --> 03:49:47,300
I guess it doesn't really matter...

3950
03:49:48,440 --> 03:49:50,640
I'm gonna make these...

3951
03:49:50,640 --> 03:49:52,460
It doesn't really matter if they're...

3952
03:49:52,460 --> 03:49:54,040
Whatever they are, so use.

3953
03:49:57,440 --> 03:49:59,840
And then actually also...

3954
03:50:06,730 --> 03:50:07,210
Use...

3955
03:50:07,210 --> 03:50:07,670
Wait, what?

3956
03:50:08,150 --> 03:50:08,590
What is that?

3957
03:50:09,490 --> 03:50:10,130
Oh, there we go.

3958
03:50:10,190 --> 03:50:10,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3959
03:50:10,650 --> 03:50:11,250
And then use.

3960
03:50:12,850 --> 03:50:13,390
There we go.

3961
03:50:13,470 --> 03:50:13,670
Okay.

3962
03:50:14,890 --> 03:50:17,310
Now... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

3963
03:50:18,670 --> 03:50:19,810
I'm such a genius!

3964
03:50:23,570 --> 03:50:24,910
But we don't get the multiplier.

3965
03:50:26,670 --> 03:50:28,590
We don't get the 5 of a kind multiplier.

3966
03:50:29,850 --> 03:50:30,730
Will we be okay?

3967
03:50:33,750 --> 03:50:34,670
Lower mult, yeah.

3968
03:50:37,870 --> 03:50:39,110
I guess we'll see.

3969
03:50:41,130 --> 03:50:42,230
Time to see!

3970
03:50:42,870 --> 03:50:43,590
Time to see!

3971
03:50:49,200 --> 03:50:49,920
We're okay.

3972
03:50:57,280 --> 03:51:00,320
Now we have to start getting the planet that...

3973
03:51:00,320 --> 03:51:01,440
Oh no, it's this voucher.

3974
03:51:02,300 --> 03:51:03,020
I have a question.

3975
03:51:03,140 --> 03:51:04,360
For the blank...

3976
03:51:04,360 --> 03:51:06,020
You have to get how many of them?

3977
03:51:07,180 --> 03:51:08,700
Is it in total?

3978
03:51:08,700 --> 03:51:12,760
Like, even if I were to die...

3979
03:51:12,760 --> 03:51:14,700
In the anti...

3980
03:51:16,720 --> 03:51:18,060
Across all runs.

3981
03:51:18,240 --> 03:51:18,940
Oh, I see.

3982
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:20,200
Okay, so it's worth it.

3983
03:51:21,160 --> 03:51:22,100
In all your runs.

3984
03:51:22,200 --> 03:51:22,400
Okay.

3985
03:51:22,660 --> 03:51:26,040
Try looking up.

3986
03:51:26,200 --> 03:51:26,700
They got...

3987
03:51:27,460 --> 03:51:29,080
Pilatro Yuri on Tumblr.

3988
03:51:29,480 --> 03:51:30,600
Also, there's a...

3989
03:51:30,600 --> 03:51:31,940
Blue Storm Yuri mod.

3990
03:51:32,020 --> 03:51:32,300
What?

3991
03:51:33,980 --> 03:51:34,540
Excuse me?

3992
03:51:36,160 --> 03:51:37,180
No face card.

3993
03:51:45,610 --> 03:51:47,910
More lucky cards!

3994
03:51:50,250 --> 03:51:51,170
Feed.

3995
03:51:51,550 --> 03:51:52,890
Feed the fortune.

3996
03:51:56,400 --> 03:51:58,580
Converts up to 3 to the clubs.

3997
03:51:58,680 --> 03:51:59,500
Okay, that works.

3998
03:52:00,820 --> 03:52:02,120
Enhances 1 into steel.

3999
03:52:02,540 --> 03:52:03,320
That works.

4000
03:52:04,000 --> 03:52:04,800
That works.

4001
03:52:06,240 --> 03:52:07,640
I'm gonna jumbo.

4002
03:52:08,240 --> 03:52:09,100
Mumbo jumbo.

4003
03:52:15,330 --> 03:52:16,250
Skippa?

4004
03:52:22,360 --> 03:52:23,040
Skippa.

4005
03:52:24,140 --> 03:52:26,280
I don't wanna add any extras.

4006
03:52:28,620 --> 03:52:29,300
Flesh!

4007
03:52:40,060 --> 03:52:42,400
I think I'm gonna skippa.

4008
03:52:43,780 --> 03:52:44,840
Shady guy.

4009
03:52:45,840 --> 03:52:47,060
Poker hand has not been...

4010
03:52:48,040 --> 03:52:50,160
That doesn't really work for me, though.

4011
03:52:51,420 --> 03:52:52,560
I'll reroll one more time.

4012
03:52:57,660 --> 03:52:58,540
One more.

4013
03:53:01,020 --> 03:53:04,560
I guess that works.

4014
03:53:05,720 --> 03:53:06,540
Alright, next round.

4015
03:53:07,600 --> 03:53:09,320
Wait, I said I was gonna quit.

4016
03:53:11,000 --> 03:53:12,640
Okay, I'll do just this one.

4017
03:53:13,600 --> 03:53:14,160
500.

4018
03:53:14,980 --> 03:53:15,640
Holy moly.

4019
03:53:22,230 --> 03:53:24,370
I'm gonna enhance this into a steel.

4020
03:53:27,070 --> 03:53:28,890
Because then we can keep it.

4021
03:53:29,970 --> 03:53:31,410
We're not gonna play it.

4022
03:53:31,790 --> 03:53:32,930
Just one more.

4023
03:53:33,450 --> 03:53:35,050
Just one more.

4024
03:53:35,650 --> 03:53:37,770
And then...

4025
03:53:37,770 --> 03:53:38,670
To clubs.

4026
03:53:40,750 --> 03:53:42,150
It doesn't really...

4027
03:53:42,150 --> 03:53:45,610
I feel like I can just use this.

4028
03:53:46,490 --> 03:53:47,730
I feel like it doesn't really matter.

4029
03:53:48,490 --> 03:53:49,710
On anything, you know?

4030
03:53:50,570 --> 03:53:52,730
Just to feed the fortune teller.

4031
03:53:52,970 --> 03:53:55,910
I don't wanna keep switching all my aces around.

4032
03:53:56,430 --> 03:53:58,510
So I'm just gonna use it on these guys.

4033
03:53:59,230 --> 03:54:01,470
And then I'm going to throw them away.

4034
03:54:02,410 --> 03:54:02,850
Goodbye.

4035
03:54:05,250 --> 03:54:06,810
1, 2, 3, 4.

4036
03:54:07,770 --> 03:54:08,910
Our four of a kind is...

4037
03:54:10,390 --> 03:54:10,870
Insane.

4038
03:54:11,390 --> 03:54:13,310
Our four of a kind...

4039
03:54:13,310 --> 03:54:14,390
Is actually insane.

4040
03:54:28,260 --> 03:54:29,000
560k, though.

4041
03:54:29,020 --> 03:54:30,000
I know it's scary.

4042
03:54:31,820 --> 03:54:32,740
It's scary.

4043
03:54:32,880 --> 03:54:33,840
It's really scary.

4044
03:54:38,980 --> 03:54:40,580
No way.

4045
03:54:41,600 --> 03:54:43,640
So close.

4046
03:54:49,560 --> 03:54:50,700
We got it, though.

4047
03:54:51,360 --> 03:54:52,840
We got it, though.

4048
03:54:53,600 --> 03:54:54,520
We're okay.

4049
03:54:54,820 --> 03:54:55,980
Gambling for real.

4050
03:54:58,520 --> 03:55:01,500
This is absolute overkill, but I don't care.

4051
03:55:05,740 --> 03:55:07,740
Absolute overkill, but I don't care.

4052
03:55:30,520 --> 03:55:31,160
Wait!

4053
03:55:31,300 --> 03:55:31,820
Flesh 5!

4054
03:55:32,140 --> 03:55:33,400
We have it!

4055
03:55:34,060 --> 03:55:35,900
We have it, the Flesh 5.

4056
03:55:38,840 --> 03:55:39,480
Nice.

4057
03:55:44,260 --> 03:55:45,460
Holy cow.

4058
03:55:49,060 --> 03:55:50,760
It's the most I've ever had.

4059
03:55:55,940 --> 03:55:56,580
Okay.

4060
03:55:57,340 --> 03:55:58,020
How do I save?

4061
03:55:58,200 --> 03:55:59,120
How do I leave the game?

4062
03:56:00,600 --> 03:56:03,640
If I just go to main menu, will it save what I just did?

4063
03:56:08,780 --> 03:56:10,380
If I go to main menu, are we good?

4064
03:56:14,460 --> 03:56:16,160
Black deck unlocked.

4065
03:56:17,540 --> 03:56:18,500
Joker unlocked!

4066
03:56:20,840 --> 03:56:21,900
We got the guy.

4067
03:56:23,320 --> 03:56:24,280
Nebula deck.

4068
03:56:24,880 --> 03:56:27,020
Start run with the telescope voucher.

4069
03:56:32,430 --> 03:56:34,430
Max out the earnings per...

4070
03:56:36,250 --> 03:56:37,370
Where is the cap on...

4071
03:56:41,470 --> 03:56:43,030
Isn't there like a secret card here?

4072
03:56:46,580 --> 03:56:48,580
Play a hand that contains Force.

4073
03:56:52,540 --> 03:56:53,700
Oh, interesting.

4074
03:56:54,040 --> 03:56:54,740
These are so specific.

4075
03:56:55,180 --> 03:56:59,240
Sadly, the Sims didn't work out today, but you made a really fun stream regardless, and I'm always happy about more Bellatro.

4076
03:56:59,580 --> 03:57:00,540
Thank you, Rob!

4077
03:57:00,540 --> 03:57:05,500
Yeah, I'm sorry, you guys, that Bellatro happened.

4078
03:57:06,780 --> 03:57:11,280
That the Sims didn't happen, but Bellatro happened.

4079
03:57:12,080 --> 03:57:14,800
I'll update the title.

4080
03:57:15,980 --> 03:57:17,200
And the thumbnail.

4081
03:57:18,980 --> 03:57:20,720
For half Sims, half Bellatro.

4082
03:57:21,320 --> 03:57:23,540
But I think it's Matara's fault.

4083
03:57:24,220 --> 03:57:27,200
I think it's Matara's fault that she was cursed.

4084
03:57:28,240 --> 03:57:28,960
And...

4085
03:57:31,380 --> 03:57:32,620
Yeah, that's about it.

4086
03:57:32,860 --> 03:57:36,960
I think she ruined my luck.

4087
03:57:37,340 --> 03:57:38,200
My computer.

4088
03:57:38,880 --> 03:57:40,180
My mental state.

4089
03:57:42,680 --> 03:57:45,760
But, also, go wish her a very happy birthday.

4090
03:57:46,320 --> 03:57:47,080
Is she still streaming?

4091
03:57:49,660 --> 03:57:50,780
Is she still going?

4092
03:57:55,700 --> 03:57:56,740
Oh, she is!

4093
03:57:56,800 --> 03:57:58,140
I wonder if I can raid her YouTube.

4094
03:58:02,360 --> 03:58:03,060
Let's try.

4095
03:58:05,860 --> 03:58:06,600
Oh, I can!

4096
03:58:07,700 --> 03:58:09,860
Okay, we'll raid Matara's birthday stream.

4097
03:58:10,000 --> 03:58:13,080
Everybody go wish Matara a very, very, very happy birthday.

4098
03:58:15,240 --> 03:58:22,640
So that she'll be happy, so that now that she's closer to death, we can make her happy so she'll have no regrets.

4099
03:58:22,740 --> 03:58:27,160
And then she can die and won't become a ghost and I'll never have to see her again.

4100
03:58:30,180 --> 03:58:33,920
We want her to have a happy, fulfilling life so that she doesn't become a ghost.

4101
03:58:36,940 --> 03:58:37,720
Okay, guys.

4102
03:58:39,520 --> 03:58:41,040
I'm sorry Matara did this to you.

4103
03:58:41,220 --> 03:58:43,260
I will never forgive her even if it's her birthday.

4104
03:58:43,680 --> 03:58:45,780
Matara's birthday wish was for you to play Bellatrio.

4105
03:58:49,900 --> 03:58:50,780
Otsumito, everybody!

4106
03:58:51,680 --> 03:58:52,520
Thank you, guys.

4107
03:58:52,640 --> 03:58:54,720
I will see you guys later.

4108
03:58:57,580 --> 03:58:59,060
Am I lagging a little?

4109
03:59:09,520 --> 03:59:11,880
Bye bye!

4110
03:59:12,420 --> 03:59:13,140
Itadakimasu!
