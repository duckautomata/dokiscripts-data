1
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,740
Not too long ago, Zoombinis enjoyed the good life.

2
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,440
Though they all looked slightly different, different eyes, noses, hair, teeth...

3
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,780
Such differences meant nothing to the Zoombinis.

4
00:02:53,100 --> 00:03:01,760
And so they lived happily on Zoombini Isle, making small, useful products which were prized the world over.

5
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,360
The Zoombinis had a sense of fulfillment and inner peace, not to mention healthy bank accounts.

6
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,680
Then one day, who should show up but the Bloats.

7
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:35,120
The Bloats offered to help the Zoombinis grow their businesses, expand their trade routes, and improve their quality of life.

8
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,460
Nice!

9
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,240
Being trusting sorts, the Zoombinis agreed.

10
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,260
Oh wait, no, we do hate those guys!

11
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,580
They're bad guys!

12
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,380
But before long, the Bloats had taken over everything.

13
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,120
No!

14
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,440
Stealing profits.

15
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,100
Canceling holidays.

16
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,340
High holidays!

17
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,100
Piling on work.

18
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,380
Oh my god.

19
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,300
The Zoombinis were getting pretty stressed out.

20
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,440
Oh, they're stressed!

21
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Well, you can push them only so far before they take matters into their own hands.

22
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,080
Viva la revolucion!

23
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,660
Zoombinis!

24
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,500
Oh my god.

25
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,920
And so they decided to escape.

26
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,620
Escape.

27
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,300
And build a new home in a distant land!

28
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,780
Oh my gosh, sorry.

29
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,520
Hello everybody!

30
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,020
Welcome back!

31
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,580
Master!

32
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,460
Lady!

33
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,460
Hello!

34
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,040
Hello hello hello!

35
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,800
Welcome!

36
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,840
Oh, I guess I could have gotten to this part and then clicked watch intro.

37
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,460
But I wasn't sure...

38
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,040
If it would be okay.

39
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,280
So...

40
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,500
Hello!

41
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,640
Hello hello!

42
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,080
Welcome to a Zoombi...

43
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,300
I love this game.

44
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,720
I love this game.

45
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,540
From my ghostly childhood.

46
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,500
When I was a wee wisp.

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,020
And I would play this game.

48
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,400
I would...

49
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,840
I can remember so many sound effects from this game.

50
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,980
I'm so sorry.

51
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm gonna be so annoying.

52
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,680
But this one is like...

53
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,200
I guess...

54
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,300
The remake.

55
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,340
I guess technically it's a remake.

56
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,740
And it...

57
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,940
Has like...

58
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,720
New art.

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,640
And...

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,080
I don't...

61
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,500
I think...

62
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,620
That's it though.

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,400
Thank you!

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,880
Can you guys hear the...

65
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,640
Donuts?

66
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,760
I turned down the volume quite a bit.

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,900
Because the Zoombini game was so loud.

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,340
But I can hear them.

69
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,160
So I can see...

70
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,760
I can see...

71
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,360
Your stuff.

72
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,940
Cracks me up how much...

73
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,080
Of the story of Zoombinis went over my head as a kid.

74
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,260
Yeah.

75
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,840
I...

76
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,020
I'll be honest.

77
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,940
I remember them...

78
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,880
They having to...

79
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,020
Leave.

80
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,720
I remember them having to leave.

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,500
Thank you for the dough.

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:05,640
No.

83
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,540
Because...

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,640
Um...

85
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,660
Uh...

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Because of something.

87
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,880
I couldn't remember why.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,040
It's actually missing some sound effects I think.

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,740
Don't tell me that.

90
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,180
Don't tell me that.

91
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,720
I might cry.

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,940
I might actually cry.

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
They did that to me in Spiral.

94
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,540
There was like...

95
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,760
It's the smallest thing in Spyro.

96
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,860
In Spyro 2.

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,680
Ripto's Rage.

98
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
When they remade it.

99
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,320
And the one world with the guys that...

100
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,160
That do the ice skating.

101
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,440
And there's the evil spirits that you have to exorcise.

102
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,720
They go...

103
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,740
Why I am...

104
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,700
Why I am...

105
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,800
They do that in the original.

106
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
But they changed it for some reason.

107
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,780
In the remake.

108
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,620
I don't know why.

109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,440
I don't know why.

110
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,860
It makes me so sad.

111
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,280
But...

112
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,760
You know.

113
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,680
It is what it is.

114
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,860
Here I think...

115
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,940
At least the voices are the same as you could hear from Crunchy Narrator-san.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,300
He sounds so...

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,440
The Zoombinis.

118
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,060
That's what he talks like.

119
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,620
Let's enter my name.

120
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,410
We don't...

121
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:22,790
No.

122
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm gonna have the smiley.

123
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,010
Alright.

124
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,130
So this is a game.

125
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,410
Where we're little Zoombinis.

126
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,370
And if you don't know what this game is.

127
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:30,550
Yeah.

128
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,030
We're little...

129
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,030
Well, we're not...

130
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,070
We are guiding the Zoombinis to salvation.

131
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,770
We are leading them from the terrors of the working world.

132
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,850
To...

133
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:51,650
To a new world where they will have holidays again.

134
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,630
Yeah!

135
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,050
And...

136
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,490
To a new world where

137
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:06,780
they can escape from the curse.

138
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,100
I remember.

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,120
I used to sit on the screen.

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,880
Because there would be a crab.

141
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,420
Boom.

142
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,600
Boom.

143
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,000
Boom.

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,260
Boom.

145
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay.

146
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,660
Okay.

147
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:28,800
Okay.

148
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,220
Oh my god.

149
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:33,760
Ronan.

150
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
Thank you so much for the Dono.

151
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,860
I don't know if you'll see this or not.

152
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,540
But I want to know that you inspired me to follow and support Vtubers who ran these And showed me the beautiful world of them.

153
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,980
I wouldn't be a Vtuber fan today if it weren't for you, my dear Kamioshi Mint Boss!

154
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,820
Sorry for taking time.

155
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,020
Not at all.

156
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,300
Thank you, Ronin.

157
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,920
You're... you know...

158
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,440
If you found where you belong, you're not a Ronin anymore.

159
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,500
Isn't that the case?

160
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,360
One of us.

161
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:03,860
One of us.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,920
Amy, thank you!

163
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,980
Tyranzor, thank you!

164
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,200
I love zumbinis.

165
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,700
Zumbinis also fart, so...

166
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,640
Or if you think you would start my new job tomorrow...

167
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,740
Congrats?

168
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:16,960
Oh my gosh!

169
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,840
Thank you!

170
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,900
Usually I will read the donos at the end of the stream, so...

171
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,180
Yes, thank you guys so much.

172
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,600
Thank you.

173
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,160
Okay!

174
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh my gosh, we get to create our zumbinis!

175
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,580
Wait, what's the multiple dice versus the one dice?

176
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,440
Oh my god!

177
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:40,800
No!

178
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,160
No, no!

179
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,120
Go back into the hole!

180
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,640
Get back in your hole!

181
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:44,980
No!

182
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,980
Oh my gosh, no.

183
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Who are these strangers?

184
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,260
No!

185
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,560
No!

186
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,620
No, they don't stop!

187
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,780
Stop!

188
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,180
Stop it!

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,440
No!

190
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,500
Oh, they're talking over...

191
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,520
No!

192
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,780
I don't know who you are!

193
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,300
Get in there!

194
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,780
Yeah, yeah, get in there!

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,620
I don't know who you are!

196
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,660
You are not welcome on my boat!

197
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,100
Get in there!

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,160
Sorry, this is an exclusive club, okay?

199
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
Yeah, this is...

200
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,620
This is...

201
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,380
You know...

202
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,780
Okay.

203
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,480
Thank you so much!

204
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,560
I have no idea what this game is about.

205
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
I look forward to find out why this holds a special place in your heart.

206
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,380
Already starting strong.

207
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,860
I think the puzzles in this are a lot of fun.

208
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,840
I would have to say my favorite one would maybe be...

209
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,220
There's a froggy one.

210
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,020
Where you release little froggies.

211
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,740
Um...

212
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,940
And they have to follow a certain path.

213
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,500
Wait!

214
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I can't name it myself?

215
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,620
Oh no!

216
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,460
I wanted to name...

217
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,560
I wanted to name them after you.

218
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,700
Joan!

219
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,380
Have fun again today!

220
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,760
We love you our most!

221
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,800
Beloved ghost maid Joan!

222
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,580
Oh my god!

223
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,340
I hope you're good!

224
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,600
Oh my gosh!

225
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,920
Isashi booty Joan!

226
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,560
Are you still doing nursing?

227
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,260
You're still good?

228
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,200
We can change our names to them.

229
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,920
No!

230
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,160
Don't do that!

231
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,840
Don't do that!

232
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,040
Okay.

233
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,920
Well maybe it would be easier to just...

234
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,680
No, no.

235
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,260
Okay.

236
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,100
Alright guys.

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,580
Oh my gosh!

238
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,300
She's so cute!

239
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,980
With the backwards hat and everything.

240
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,340
Arigato!

241
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,800
Arigato!

242
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,300
Thank you guys for the donuts!

243
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:28,720
Thank you!

244
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,980
Let's see.

245
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,400
Our first friend.

246
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,060
The cool glasses.

247
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,840
Green.

248
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,640
Like me.

249
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,240
Floating.

250
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,520
Like me.

251
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,280
Oh!

252
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,580
Ah!

253
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,690
Okay.

254
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,870
Alright.

255
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,990
Jernuagi!

256
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,530
Release!

257
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,630
Yeah!

258
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,690
Kwaru is dead.

259
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,690
Oh sorry.

260
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,350
Also.

261
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,810
Cyclops!

262
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,950
Cyclops skater!

263
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,970
Katie!

264
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,410
Release!

265
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,830
Jernuagi goes hard.

266
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,490
Kwaru is dead!

267
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,850
No no he's not!

268
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,050
No he's not!

269
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,310
He's...

270
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,910
He's...

271
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,610
Deiso!

272
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,610
Uh oh.

273
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,230
Okay hold on.

274
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,350
I gotta not go so fast.

275
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,130
I might pass it.

276
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,830
These are some crazy...

277
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,910
I don't know how to pronounce any of these.

278
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:43,890
Frofa!

279
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,730
Release Frofa!

280
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,920
Um...

281
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,260
Seiso Deiso.

282
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,180
Yeah.

283
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,120
Frofa.

284
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,480
Cthulhu names.

285
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,580
Yeah.

286
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,500
Let's see.

287
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,560
Oh the beady eyes are so funny.

288
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,780
I like the springy ones too.

289
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,560
But they're a little slow.

290
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,600
Let's do...

291
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:09,980
Sigu!

292
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,840
Boing boing boing.

293
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,920
Boing boing.

294
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,720
Sounds like my name is Kwaru now.

295
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,380
No.

296
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,480
Um...

297
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,020
Crazy hairs.

298
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,980
Sneeflu.

299
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,100
Sneeflu!

300
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,400
Like I'm just walking.

301
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,520
Walk walk walk.

302
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,780
I'm gonna call her walk.

303
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,360
Who am I missing?

304
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,220
We got flying, we got skating.

305
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,460
Okay we need a lot of guys though.

306
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,640
I'm gonna get this one random.

307
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,900
Ladle!

308
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,380
Release Slato!

309
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,540
Release Slato!

310
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:51,900
Release Slato!

311
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,660
He went bald.

312
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,880
Red nose?

313
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,060
Oh we do need a red nose.

314
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,460
Oh yeah we need a lot of colors for the future.

315
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,620
For future things.

316
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh we also don't have this hairstyle.

317
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,980
I think that...

318
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,780
Hype...

319
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,560
Emma.

320
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:07,660
Emma.

321
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,780
It's EE!

322
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,560
Oh my gosh.

323
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,360
Hold on.

324
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:13,540
EE!

325
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,700
It looks just like Emma.

326
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,660
So cranky.

327
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,180
Let's see what else do we need.

328
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,620
Rebrual!

329
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,140
What's wrong with EE?

330
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,340
Robracio!

331
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,100
I think they're siblings.

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,760
Denise!

333
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,100
You know what?

334
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,240
I am just gonna random...

335
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,560
random generate them now because...

336
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,860
Igagaga!

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,760
Igagaga!

338
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,940
Igagaga!

339
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:56,660
Igagaga!

340
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,310
Muscus!

341
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,570
We need another Cyclops.

342
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,010
Cyclops!

343
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,630
Wait you have the same hair though.

344
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,190
Let's give you this hair.

345
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:17,950
Two!

346
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,450
Thank you!

347
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,350
Oh my gosh!

348
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,010
It's been forever!

349
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:27,550
Hello!

350
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,410
There's some beanies I was taking from the hole.

351
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,750
Either truly Wisp.

352
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,990
Or truly Fantomy.

353
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,270
Stop.

354
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,950
Let's see what... Oh!

355
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,370
Sorry.

356
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,630
Everyone's gotta be different.

357
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:43,770
Daffyro!

358
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,050
Um...

359
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,850
What other...

360
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,150
Oh!

361
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,310
Kaislu!

362
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,030
Wait, we have a lot of glasses.

363
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:55,750
Hold on.

364
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,090
What do we need more of?

365
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,910
We need more beady eyed people.

366
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,290
Fleece!

367
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,030
You're not Fleece!

368
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,130
Well, whatever you are.

369
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,250
Make me a pizza!

370
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,930
Make me a pizza!

371
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,730
Um...

372
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,390
We have a couple sleepy eyes.

373
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,130
We need more beady eyes.

374
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:17,630
Come on.

375
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:19,870
Oh!

376
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,490
Emiliano!

377
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,470
How many more people can I have?

378
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,710
How many more people can I have?

379
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,870
Thank you guys for all the donuts!

380
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,330
Thank you!

381
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,930
Oh, you don't even have a name.

382
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,390
Oh, this is it!

383
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,570
This is the crew everybody.

384
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,070
The journey begins here.

385
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,310
Zumbini Isle.

386
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,290
Select traits to create a crew of 16 Zumbinis.

387
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,090
But remember, each Zumbini in this crew must be unique.

388
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,190
Oh my gosh.

389
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,370
Okay, guys.

390
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,810
I think it's time.

391
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,410
Boom boom boom boom.

392
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,830
Boom boom boom boom.

393
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,860
Why is the music so...

394
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,000
The day is tossed about by a stormy sea.

395
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,360
The Zumbinis reach the shore of the peculiar land.

396
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,900
That's a big crab.

397
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Wait, that's a huge crab.

398
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay, so our first puzzle is getting across the bridge.

399
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,480
Why was the crab so big?

400
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,500
Okay.

401
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,460
So this puzzle...

402
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,760
Each...

403
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,400
Each man...

404
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,680
This game is kind of creepy.

405
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,200
This game is a little scary.

406
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,400
So...

407
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,020
Why is there a face in that cliff?

408
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,340
That's what I'm about to tell you.

409
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,840
These cliffs are alive!

410
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,260
And they're also very picky.

411
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,160
So we have these bridges.

412
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,360
That...

413
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,240
That...

414
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,360
The Zumbinis can cross either one or the other.

415
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,400
So some traits...

416
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,920
This guy likes.

417
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,840
But this guy doesn't like.

418
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,600
And we only have this number of tries.

419
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,620
To figure out where the Zumbinis go.

420
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,560
So he's gonna...

421
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,460
He's gonna sneeze.

422
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,480
Alright, Denise.

423
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,040
Let's check...

424
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,760
Let's try this way.

425
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,300
Okay.

426
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,020
That was fast.

427
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,840
Okay, so...

428
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,720
We'll put you over here.

429
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,660
But what trait did he not like?

430
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,360
They got a type.

431
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,200
Yeah, they do.

432
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,760
Sniffle.

433
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:40,940
So...

434
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,840
Let's try the hair.

435
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,580
Let's try the hair.

436
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,860
Oh!

437
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,420
Oh!

438
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:49,920
Okay.

439
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,120
Uh...

440
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,330
A simp.

441
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,190
A soup.

442
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,370
Sigma cliffs.

443
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,170
Look at...

444
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,330
Even the rocks have faces.

445
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,250
Does that mean the ground is alive too?

446
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,070
Am I like stepping on...

447
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,830
Like this guy's got a face.

448
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,170
It's all faces.

449
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,610
Okay, uh...

450
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,890
So maybe it's glasses, no glasses?

451
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,090
So glasses here?

452
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,450
Oh!

453
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,230
Oh!

454
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,010
You think?

455
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,690
Glasses?

456
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,270
Glasses?

457
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,070
Oh!

458
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,750
Oh!

459
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,710
Oh!

460
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,780
Y'all...

461
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,100
I think we're geniuses.

462
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,840
This children's game got nothing on us.

463
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,540
Hahaha!

464
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,980
Yahoo!

465
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,320
Hahaha!

466
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,220
Oh!

467
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
Okay...

468
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,420
Our theory...

469
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,860
Has been debunked.

470
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,720
What?

471
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,620
Is it...

472
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,940
Two eyes, one eye?

473
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,680
So everyone's...

474
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,360
Going on this side.

475
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,740
What's wrong with cyclopses?

476
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,880
Two eyes...

477
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,280
That would make sense...

478
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,940
Because I put...

479
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,840
I mean, with glasses...

480
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,880
You're gonna have two eyes.

481
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,180
Yippee!

482
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,140
Oh my god, they're so loud.

483
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm gonna be adjusting the volume like crazy in this game.

484
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm so sorry.

485
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,220
Yes!

486
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,700
Me!

487
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,980
Oh wait, what is this?

488
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,860
Oh wait, oh no no.

489
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,320
Stay with him!

490
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,980
Stay with me!

491
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,740
Feeling stuck?

492
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,720
Don't worry brave explorer.

493
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,800
You have all the information you need to complete this challenge.

494
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Get all your zumbinis through.

495
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,520
Take your time.

496
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,260
Look for patterns and don't be afraid to make mistakes.

497
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,820
Allergic cliffs.

498
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,480
Why are you allergic to my zumbinis?

499
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,680
If a few of our little blue friends are left behind...

500
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,100
They'll be waiting at zumbini aisle.

501
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,300
Oh no!

502
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,740
We could have lost them!

503
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,180
Okay.

504
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,700
First trial.

505
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,320
These stone guards have their rules.

506
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,600
So do proceed with skill.

507
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,720
Zumbinis one guard won't allow.

508
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,200
The other guard surely will.

509
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,280
Okay, so it's similar.

510
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,160
It's similar like before.

511
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,660
Hello mint, hello!

512
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,580
The floodgates are opened it seems.

513
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,140
They're blue!

514
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,200
Um...

515
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,240
Okay.

516
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,640
They're blue!

517
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,140
What about it?

518
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,040
Actually I'm green.

519
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm mint.

520
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,560
A little bit of blue.

521
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,200
Okay, let's just...

522
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,700
Katie, you're up first baby.

523
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,480
No!

524
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,080
Why are you so rude?

525
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,880
Okay, so basically it's the same as before.

526
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,280
Just a little bit more.

527
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,480
And if they like...

528
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,380
If they ground pound enough...

529
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,260
The rocks will come flying down.

530
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,780
So...

531
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:32,920
Hmm.

532
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
This way.

533
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,520
Uh-uh.

534
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,680
Uh-uh.

535
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,760
Why do you say it like that?

536
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,680
To my girl Katie.

537
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,460
Okay.

538
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,120
Okay.

539
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
Thank you grandma.

540
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,280
Oh, she didn't even say anything.

541
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,560
Okay.

542
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,000
So...

543
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,700
Alright.

544
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,960
Let's try the hair again.

545
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,800
Let's do hair again.

546
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Well, why not?

547
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,180
Oh!

548
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,120
Okay.

549
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,640
Uh...

550
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,380
Okay.

551
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,380
Okay.

552
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,630
Hat or hair?

553
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,510
Well, I think that hairstyle...

554
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,070
That one always has a hat.

555
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,570
Okay.

556
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,170
Let's try ponytail.

557
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,630
Ponytail.

558
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,010
Ponytail, ponytail.

559
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,350
Ponytail.

560
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,590
Ponytail.

561
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,050
Ponytail.

562
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,170
Ponytail.

563
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,330
Ponytail.

564
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,170
Ponytail.

565
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:40,610
Ponytail.

566
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,310
Ghost laughter.

567
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,630
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

568
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,530
Let's see.

569
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:48,870
Ponytail.

570
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:50,870
Ponytail.

571
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,230
One of the chosen few.

572
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,910
Oh, you scared me for a second.

573
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,710
You scared me.

574
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,570
No, there's no chosen few.

575
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,570
There have been.

576
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,270
All of them are chosen.

577
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,950
All of them.

578
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,810
Granny Ada Ada.

579
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,290
Okay, let's see.

580
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,290
Um, let's get...

581
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,890
Let's get Sniffloo right here.

582
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,570
Go ahead, go ahead.

583
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,530
I can't let you in.

584
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,590
That's so rude.

585
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,050
That's actually...

586
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,530
You can't just reject me for no reason.

587
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,250
Well, you're okay.

588
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,990
Everyone in this game...

589
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,770
is so superficial.

590
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,650
They all just judge on looks.

591
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,830
They judge on how our appearance.

592
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,910
It's so messed up.

593
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,330
I'm glad that it's just hair though.

594
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,110
It's pretty easy.

595
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,930
Okay, Dafferil.

596
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,270
Alrighty.

597
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,050
Look, Granny's got a harem.

598
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,150
Granny's got it going on.

599
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,210
You're sad.

600
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,550
You're a sad man.

601
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,650
What, do you want Frofa?

602
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,930
Uh-uh.

603
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,790
Uh-uh.

604
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,750
Okay, Frofa.

605
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,370
Try this way.

606
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,450
Oh my god.

607
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,910
Not all doors are open to you.

608
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,290
That's so rude.

609
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,870
Oh my gosh.

610
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,170
Granny's collecting them all.

611
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,070
Are you gonna have anyone?

612
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,470
Oh my god, he's so lonely.

613
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:22,890
Certainly.

614
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,910
Certainly.

615
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,570
He's just so grumpy.

616
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,250
I know.

617
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,130
It's so rude.

618
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,950
Alright, Rubricio.

619
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:33,750
I believe in you.

620
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,450
Someone.

621
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,930
Uh-uh.

622
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,690
Uh-uh.

623
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,430
Okay, hold on.

624
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,890
This one.

625
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,630
Okay, fine.

626
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,910
Not all doors are open to you.

627
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,170
Fine.

628
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,170
You deserve no one.

629
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,050
You know what?

630
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,790
You can live your sad, lonely life.

631
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,970
It's your fault.

632
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,670
You shut yourself out from the world.

633
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,510
You beg for touch.

634
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,750
But you're the one who doesn't allow it.

635
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,250
You beg for someone to love you.

636
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,430
Well, you're okay.

637
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,410
You wish that someone could just...

638
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,850
You wish that someone would just come in.

639
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,750
But you shut the door on everybody.

640
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,670
You tell him.

641
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:17,970
Emiano.

642
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,690
You're our last little guy.

643
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,550
I feel called out.

644
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,970
I feel attacked.

645
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,870
You've done quite well.

646
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,810
You've done quite well.

647
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,210
How delightful.

648
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,510
Thank you.

649
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:40,090
And so our brave travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland until they meet...

650
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:40,570
This is the best part.

651
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,950
Arno, the almost omnivorous, one very hungry pizza troll.

652
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,210
Yes!

653
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,790
Yes!

654
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,990
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!

655
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,310
Oh, fleas!

656
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,090
You're not!

657
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,030
Please!

658
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,470
Wherever you are.

659
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,790
Make me a pizza!

660
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,370
Yes!

661
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,010
Oh my gosh.

662
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,970
Okay, so basically we have to make him a pizza.

663
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,390
And make it exactly as he likes.

664
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,090
We don't know what he likes.

665
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,850
So we just have to go combo by combo.

666
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,530
Let's do cheese.

667
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,150
Just cheese.

668
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:31,810
Cheese.

669
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,370
More toppings!

670
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,380
Okay, so if he throws it over here, that means he doesn't like any of the toppings.

671
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,940
But if he throws it over here, that means he'll still eat it.

672
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,420
So he does like the cheese.

673
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,840
More toppings!

674
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:55,890
Thank you!

675
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,750
Thank you for all the great past adventures here to Minnie Moore.

676
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,590
Thank you so much!

677
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,050
Thank you!

678
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,970
I was just trying to check out the stream on my break, but things got way too real, way too fast.

679
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,870
I'm so sorry.

680
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,950
I gotta keep it real.

681
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:13,390
I'm sorry.

682
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:14,990
Okay.

683
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,970
More toppings!

684
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,370
Let's just do mushrooms.

685
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,910
And eventually there's three guys.

686
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,970
Something must go!

687
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,110
Oh, he does not like the mushroom.

688
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,850
He's just like me.

689
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,530
Me for real, for real.

690
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,190
Okay.

691
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,050
I like when he says, there's something on that I don't like.

692
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,190
Please.

693
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,630
I kind of want to put in mushrooms again just so he says it.

694
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,910
There's stuff on that I don't like!

695
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,930
Oh, he says it a different way though.

696
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,210
He's so cute though.

697
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,910
The way his mouth is so like...

698
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,570
Wait, wait, wait.

699
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,830
Hold on, hold on.

700
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,470
I can do that.

701
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,730
I can do that too.

702
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,030
It's so...

703
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,970
There's something on that I don't like!

704
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,460
Okay.

705
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Cheese, peppers.

706
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,560
Pineapple.

707
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,320
No.

708
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:29,960
Pineapple.

709
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,040
Cheese, pineapple.

710
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,020
The goaded combination.

711
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,160
I know you love it, Trunkman.

712
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,380
I know you love it.

713
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,820
Thank you, thank you.

714
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,620
You did it!

715
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,540
You saved them all!

716
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,640
I saved them.

717
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,500
Somehow.

718
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,600
Good job, whoever you are.

719
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,920
Eventually, if you get it wrong enough times, they'll punch you and your little zumbinis will fly away.

720
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, a camp!

721
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,760
It's so good.

722
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,380
The music is so awesome.

723
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,100
Hold on.

724
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,480
What's this?

725
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,020
A campsite with hot soup all ready to eat?

726
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,040
A campsite with hot soup all ready to eat?

727
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,760
For zumbinis to relax!

728
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:43,000
But when they're ready to move on, they'll need a group of 16 along the path.

729
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,620
16.

730
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,900
Yeah, so we have to keep our whole crew.

731
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,780
And this also boils.

732
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,940
I remember all the clicks.

733
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,140
I remember all the clicks.

734
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,860
Actually, that's the only two I...

735
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,940
Let's change it to green.

736
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,540
Like me.

737
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,240
Oh.

738
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,080
More mintings!

739
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,440
It's great seeing you be so passionate about the things you love.

740
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,320
Man, the audio of this game brings back so many memories of that era.

741
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,840
Now, we have to decide.

742
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,220
Which way do we go?

743
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,740
I'll be honest, I don't remember which one leads to which path.

744
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,300
So we have to make a decision.

745
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,700
Corn soup?

746
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,580
I wish.

747
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,000
I'll be honest, when I would see this as a kid, I used to think it was poison.

748
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,460
It doesn't look like a good soup.

749
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,940
Doesn't look...

750
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,020
I don't like that.

751
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,360
He sounds too close.

752
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,580
He sounds so like...

753
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
in my ear.

754
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,320
Didn't like that one.

755
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,540
This...

756
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,960
This one looks a little like it's got a butt cheek.

757
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,640
Okay, guys.

758
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,020
Let's make a poll.

759
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,520
Let's make a poll.

760
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,040
When I click out of the game, you won't hear it anymore.

761
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,200
So, start a poll.

762
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,080
Which direction?

763
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,320
There's two.

764
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,360
I'm pretty sure there's another time when we get to choose.

765
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,000
So left, or I'll go up, down.

766
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,280
Check the map.

767
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:21,820
No, no!

768
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,840
We're adventurers!

769
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
We're adventuring!

770
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,500
We don't know what the road will go to!

771
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,440
It's all about the discovery, baby!

772
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
Down for down bad.

773
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,600
Team up.

774
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,720
Adventurers also check their maps.

775
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,980
No, they don't!

776
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,780
Not the zumbinis.

777
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,960
They are...

778
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,080
They are full of whimsy.

779
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,060
Okay.

780
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,260
All right.

781
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,240
It looks like it's up.

782
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,660
Let's go upward.

783
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:08,020
I think we're going through this game so quickly we'll be able to play again and we can go downwards next time.

784
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:22,920
Zumbinis must have something in common with their neighbor to sit on Captain Cajun's Ferry.

785
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,840
Oh my god.

786
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,460
It's so soulful.

787
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:36,900
Wow!

788
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,000
The art looks so good!

789
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,920
Welcome to the booth.

790
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,080
Now hurry yourselves up and find your seat.

791
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:42,980
Okay.

792
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,000
So, they have to have something in common.

793
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,760
This is easy.

794
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,560
Well, sit wherever you want to.

795
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,600
I don't really care.

796
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,640
I don't really care.

797
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,680
I don't really care.

798
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,080
Okay.

799
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,560
Ponytail.

800
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,360
This one's easy.

801
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,920
This one's so easy.

802
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,740
There you go.

803
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,220
You got it.

804
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,860
There you go.

805
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,580
You got it.

806
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,740
Everything's rushing back to me.

807
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,180
Even the things that I was like, oh, I don't really remember this part so much.

808
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,880
We'll go by eyes.

809
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,000
There you go.

810
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,540
You got it.

811
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,500
There you go.

812
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,200
You got it.

813
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,380
Well, first it...

814
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,180
I went eyes to hair.

815
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:20,680
Oops.

816
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,540
It's fine, though.

817
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,560
If we have to adjust anybody, we can do that.

818
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,560
If we have to adjust anybody, we can do that.

819
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,400
There you go.

820
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,880
You got it.

821
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,340
Like we have to do right now.

822
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,040
Yep.

823
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,880
Hold on.

824
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,340
Okay.

825
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,620
Hold on.

826
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,200
There you go.

827
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,820
You got it.

828
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,480
Let's see.

829
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,540
I actually don't remember what happens if you put a wrong guy down.

830
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,700
Oh, dang.

831
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,860
Are you okay?

832
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,050
Let's see.

833
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,570
They have springs and they have sleepy eyes.

834
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,730
Hey, what?

835
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,410
What are you doing there?

836
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,010
Excuse me.

837
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,450
I need the sleepy eyes.

838
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,130
Let's see.

839
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,390
Hold on.

840
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,390
Hold on.

841
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,410
Blue nose is...

842
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,250
Hmm.

843
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:29,630
Hmm.

844
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,190
Hmm.

845
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,670
Here's the noses.

846
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,830
Yeah, let's go by noses instead.

847
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,230
We'll go by noses instead.

848
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,030
Shp.

849
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,510
Shp.

850
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:40,890
Shp.

851
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,470
Shp.

852
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:41,970
Shp.

853
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,530
Green.

854
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,230
Green.

855
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,910
Green.

856
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,210
Green.

857
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,690
There you go.

858
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,190
You got it.

859
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,430
Oh, I can't see.

860
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,150
Everybody separate.

861
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:48,950
Separate.

862
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,330
Stop being so close to each other.

863
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,430
Okay.

864
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,950
And then we'll go pink.

865
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,530
Pink nose.

866
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,170
I shouldn't have separated the...

867
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:00,450
Ah.

868
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:01,570
Sure.

869
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,430
Sure.

870
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,810
Now red nose.

871
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,550
Now yellow nose.

872
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,270
But I'm probably gonna have to switch it again, I think.

873
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:13,730
Wait.

874
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,010
What do you have in... Oh, there we go.

875
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,270
Feet.

876
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:16,450
Feet.

877
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,430
Oh.

878
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,490
There we go.

879
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,710
Ah.

880
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,110
Sure.

881
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:21,610
Sure.

882
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,910
There you go.

883
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,450
You got it.

884
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,210
Oh, I'm done.

885
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:25,790
Mister.

886
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:27,590
Mister.

887
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,510
Mister.

888
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,170
Oh my god.

889
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,890
I could've left at any time.

890
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,510
I could've...

891
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,190
The frogs!

892
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,010
We could've just left them... There.

893
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,190
We could've just left them.

894
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,150
That's so sad.

895
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:49,690
Yes!

896
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,790
Oh my gosh.

897
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,790
I love this one.

898
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,370
This one's so fun.

899
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,950
Okay, so each froggy has a pattern, right?

900
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,650
And you have to...

901
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,290
They can only go...

902
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,150
I don't... I think they can't go diagonal.

903
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,330
So they can only go... You have to drop them on the correct spot that gets them to the other side.

904
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,090
So, like, say, we go with the X guy.

905
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,310
But they can only be used a couple times.

906
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,250
Like, you can't say, like, oh, okay, let's have all 16 Zoombinis get on this one guy.

907
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:17,770
No, no, no.

908
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,870
Only, like, a certain amount.

909
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,570
So, it's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

910
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,410
No.

911
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,530
See, we can't go that way.

912
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,050
Let's see.

913
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,310
If we do boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

914
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:26,750
No.

915
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,470
Boom, boom.

916
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,330
Wait.

917
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,470
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

918
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,730
Boom, boom.

919
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,150
Oh, I don't think we can use the X.

920
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,050
Okay, never mind.

921
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:38,830
Okay, next.

922
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,410
He...

923
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,510
I don't... I think he's out.

924
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,170
I think he's out.

925
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,370
Let's try... Oh!

926
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,930
And then there's also, like, the shape of the lily pad.

927
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:53,590
So, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

928
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:58,690
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, BOOM!

929
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,280
And they're very slow.

930
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,300
Where are you going?

931
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,260
Where are you going?

932
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,460
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

933
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,320
Frog, Noooo!

934
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,800
How did

935
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,780
you do this?

936
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,480
Wait,

937
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,990
maybe he'll make it eventually.

938
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,510
Actually... Okay, okay, this time.

939
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,590
This is the run.

940
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,390
This is the run.

941
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,470
Thank you guys, thank you so much!

942
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:25,730
I always thought it was a shame that you didn't get to use this model much, so seeing you come back with updated rigging is awesome.

943
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,310
I'm so glad, thank you!

944
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,570
Yes.

945
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:30,970
Yes.

946
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,010
Yes.

947
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,550
Yes.

948
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,050
Yes.

949
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,290
Yes!

950
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,090
Okay, nice.

951
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,630
There we go.

952
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,690
It reminded... Oh my gosh.

953
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,130
You know what that reminded me of?

954
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:55,210
You know that video of the girl who's watching someone put the shapes in the holes?

955
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,570
And he's just like, this is a rectangle shape.

956
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,270
What shape does it go into?

957
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,290
And she's like, the rectangle.

958
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,550
And he's like, that's right, the circle hole.

959
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,150
Or the square hole.

960
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,530
And she's like, no, that's how I felt at that very moment.

961
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:15,990
Okay.

962
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:23,010
Do we put ourselves through... Actually, I just realized the yellow one is an absolute straight shot, so let's just...

963
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,490
There's no room for error here.

964
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,330
Yes.

965
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,470
Just go, go, go.

966
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,010
All the way.

967
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,970
Also, the blue one.

968
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,190
You can do multiples at a time, so...

969
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,990
There we go.

970
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:38,890
There we go.

971
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,870
The pink one...

972
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,570
You can also go.

973
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,170
But you don't want them, like, running into each other.

974
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,410
So it's probably safer to do the colors together.

975
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,610
The teal one works too?

976
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,770
You're so right!

977
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,450
Oh my god, speedrun.

978
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,870
What about the red one?

979
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,170
Red also works!

980
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,430
Oh, there's...

981
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,090
Oh my god, frog mania.

982
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,450
Frog mania!

983
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,450
All the colors are good?

984
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,290
That's crazy.

985
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,610
Do you guys like this sound?

986
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,370
I hope they... I wish they would sink.

987
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,590
I don't think there's a way for them to sink, but if there were...

988
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,550
If there were a way, it would be really great.

989
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:42,670
Yes?

990
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,170
There's something about...

991
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,970
Old games that just have, like, that...

992
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,050
They just...

993
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:49,590
It's like...

994
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,650
Oh my gosh, have you guys ever listened to the Barbie movies?

995
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,310
Like, listen...

996
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,170
Just look up clips of the Barbie movies.

997
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,490
Like the...

998
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,210
The old, old ones.

999
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,650
You know, the animation ones.

1000
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,650
And how...

1001
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,590
How crisp her heels are on the ground.

1002
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,290
Oh, actually, all of them...

1003
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,770
All of them, like, walking just sounds so satisfying.

1004
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,450
They just...

1005
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,330
Oh, it sounds so good.

1006
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,150
Okay.

1007
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,390
Um...

1008
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,270
Should we try this one again?

1009
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,110
Let's get it going while we look for another pattern on, like, the other side.

1010
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:25,670
I think.

1011
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,590
X works too?

1012
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,110
It does?

1013
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,710
I thought we said it didn't.

1014
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,110
Okay.

1015
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:34,830
He's...

1016
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,670
He's going.

1017
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:36,350
He's going.

1018
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:36,910
He's going.

1019
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:37,850
Okay, let's try...

1020
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:40,310
Um...

1021
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,050
Oh, three leaf.

1022
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:44,570
One.

1023
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:47,970
Three.

1024
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,190
Three, three, three, three.

1025
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:52,570
Three.

1026
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,170
Oh, that one works, actually.

1027
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,050
Was it here?

1028
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,830
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1029
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:58,510
Do.

1030
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,530
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1031
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:00,730
Yep.

1032
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,130
Nice.

1033
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,730
Three leaf on the light blue.

1034
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,750
Mint confirmed heel click fetish.

1035
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,970
Is that a real fetish?

1036
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,270
Actually?

1037
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,030
Oh.

1038
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:14,390
He messed up.

1039
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,370
Oh, he messed up again.

1040
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,550
Okay, I don't think we're gonna use you anymore.

1041
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,230
I think you'll just get...

1042
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,090
You'll get a little too confused, mister.

1043
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,390
Okay, again.

1044
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,250
If you have to ask.

1045
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:35,070
I learned the other day that, um, stepping on stuff is a fetish, too.

1046
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,550
I didn't know.

1047
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,090
Like, someone would be like, oh, I'm...

1048
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,770
Oh, no, I stepped on a slice of bread.

1049
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,910
I didn't know.

1050
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,010
But I just...

1051
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,210
I just wonder what's the...

1052
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,690
What is the...

1053
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,990
Oh, okay.

1054
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,190
He's gone now.

1055
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,330
Like, what gets you going about that?

1056
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,050
Well, maybe crushing.

1057
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:57,810
I kind of...

1058
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,790
I mean, I don't know.

1059
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,590
Maybe I do get it.

1060
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,690
Maybe I learned just now.

1061
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,790
Maybe I understood in this very moment.

1062
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,010
Okay.

1063
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:13,830
Anyway.

1064
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:14,970
Let's see.

1065
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,090
Uh, we have this pattern as well.

1066
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,530
Let's see.

1067
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:18,830
Oh, no.

1068
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,450
Uh, no.

1069
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,210
Hmm.

1070
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:23,610
What else?

1071
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,430
We got diamonds.

1072
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:27,870
Hmm.

1073
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:29,710
No.

1074
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,470
We got flowers.

1075
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,230
No.

1076
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,490
Four leaf.

1077
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,450
No.

1078
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,370
Okay.

1079
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,530
So, it has to be this one, right?

1080
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,130
The yellow X.

1081
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:46,810
This one?

1082
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,230
Oh.

1083
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:48,530
Oh.

1084
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:50,310
Oh.

1085
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:50,950
Wait.

1086
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,070
Oh.

1087
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:57,670
Oh.

1088
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,230
Oh.

1089
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:58,410
Ah.

1090
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,170
Oh, he's going to get just as confused as I am.

1091
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,530
He's going to get just as confused as I am.

1092
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,170
IDK.

1093
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,930
I'm watching at 144p.

1094
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,530
Is it for the true, like, 90s...

1095
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,750
Like, um, 90s game experience?

1096
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:20,850
Aesthetic?

1097
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:26,930
Oh.

1098
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:27,530
Oh.

1099
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:27,750
Oh.

1100
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:28,050
Oh.

1101
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:28,650
Oh.

1102
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:29,330
Oh.

1103
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:29,410
Oh.

1104
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:29,790
He did it.

1105
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,150
He did it.

1106
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:30,510
He did it.

1107
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,630
He's a smart frog.

1108
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,070
You're a smart frog.

1109
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:33,550
You are.

1110
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:33,910
You are.

1111
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,970
How do these guys live?

1112
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:41,830
Nice.

1113
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:42,490
Okay.

1114
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,410
Last one.

1115
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,330
Last one.

1116
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,230
Yeah, I never played Putt-Putt.

1117
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:57,810
I only played one game of Freddy Fish.

1118
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:58,530
And this.

1119
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,650
I played Myst a little bit.

1120
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,010
Did I understand Myst?

1121
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,910
No.

1122
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,250
But I played it.

1123
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,230
I played...

1124
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,690
Well, I would...

1125
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,670
I would watch my dad play Diablo.

1126
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,890
And never Winter Nights.

1127
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:15,910
Beem.

1128
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,530
Beem.

1129
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,170
Myst, my beloved.

1130
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:25,730
Okay.

1131
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,250
Thank you for the...

1132
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:28,530
Oh, no.

1133
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:29,510
Did it?

1134
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,130
Did it?

1135
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:30,690
Did it?

1136
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,270
Did it?

1137
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,390
Did it?

1138
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:31,450
Did it?

1139
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:31,490
Did it?

1140
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:37,410
This is...

1141
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,450
Oh, I remember this one.

1142
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,590
I remember really liking the sounds in this puzzle.

1143
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,290
Gosh, I love the frog ones so much.

1144
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:56,170
Okay.

1145
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,330
So, this one, you just have to not be lonely.

1146
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,470
Actually, this works.

1147
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,210
This works perfectly because I only have two people.

1148
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,230
Oh, just kidding.

1149
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,750
Um...

1150
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,310
What do I do with him?

1151
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,050
Well, I failed.

1152
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,090
No.

1153
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:21,530
Uh-oh.

1154
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:22,710
Uh-oh.

1155
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,510
Wait.

1156
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:23,950
Lato.

1157
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,110
Sni-Flu.

1158
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:27,650
Oh.

1159
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:28,150
Oh, sorry.

1160
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,450
Sni-Flu.

1161
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,750
Sorry.

1162
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,450
I didn't mean to burn your butt.

1163
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:31,830
I didn't mean to burn your butt like that.

1164
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:33,850
Zafiro.

1165
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,290
I love the crunchy sounds so much.

1166
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,510
We have one Cyclops.

1167
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,990
Two Cyclops.

1168
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:47,410
Okay.

1169
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,410
That one actually...

1170
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,270
Shit.

1171
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,950
Um...

1172
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,710
Feet.

1173
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,880
This one...

1174
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,170
Oh.

1175
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:07,130
This one also works.

1176
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,670
All you have to do is have eyebrows.

1177
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:10,710
Oh.

1178
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,310
Eyeballs, I guess.

1179
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:14,770
Um...

1180
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:16,390
Oh!

1181
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,190
Wait.

1182
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,890
I just realized...

1183
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,190
Oh.

1184
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,590
I'm an idiot.

1185
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,390
It's the same feet...

1186
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:23,470
Oh.

1187
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:24,410
Okay.

1188
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,170
You guys...

1189
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,410
Children's game.

1190
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,910
This game's not outsmarting me, okay?

1191
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,370
This game is not outsmarting me.

1192
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,310
Okay.

1193
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,490
We need...

1194
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:36,930
Okay.

1195
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:37,430
Maybe...

1196
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,450
Then...

1197
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:39,850
Okay.

1198
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,600
Okay.

1199
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,220
Not the hair.

1200
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:44,780
For...

1201
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,200
Well...

1202
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,480
Okay.

1203
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,200
You can be matched with someone else, though.

1204
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,300
You can have the same feet...

1205
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,460
As him.

1206
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,980
You can have the same nose...

1207
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,220
As him.

1208
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,400
And...

1209
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,980
You guys can have the same hair.

1210
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,540
But then we need...

1211
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:08,780
Hmm...

1212
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,260
It's just the right difficulty.

1213
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:12,960
Okay.

1214
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,220
Okay.

1215
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:13,600
Okay.

1216
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,120
Let's...

1217
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,220
Hmm...

1218
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,160
Same hair.

1219
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,420
They don't have the same feet.

1220
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,020
They don't have...

1221
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,960
Do I have another rollie?

1222
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,900
Her.

1223
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,640
Hmm...

1224
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,500
Can I switch around?

1225
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,820
Who can I switch around?

1226
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,140
Blah.

1227
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,600
Blah.

1228
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:44,960
Glasses.

1229
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,820
Bottom right has the same hair.

1230
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,080
That's true.

1231
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,580
That is...

1232
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:49,820
Yeah.

1233
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,400
That's true.

1234
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,260
But...

1235
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,800
They also have the same feet.

1236
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,440
Wait.

1237
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:55,820
So...

1238
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,440
If I...

1239
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,140
Can...

1240
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,020
Move...

1241
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,940
Someone...

1242
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,180
Okay.

1243
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,420
Hold on.

1244
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,740
We...

1245
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,420
Rollie?

1246
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,940
But they don't have the same nose.

1247
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,440
But they...

1248
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:06,640
Okay.

1249
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:06,880
Hold on.

1250
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,180
Oh!

1251
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,780
Sorry.

1252
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:11,380
Sorry.

1253
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:11,720
Sorry.

1254
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:11,940
Sorry.

1255
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:12,340
Sorry.

1256
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,500
Sorry.

1257
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:12,820
Sorry.

1258
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,760
Okay.

1259
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,840
And then...

1260
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,620
We gotta make this possible, you guys.

1261
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:20,920
Okay.

1262
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,360
You...

1263
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,940
You guys have the same eyes.

1264
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,960
You guys have the same eyes.

1265
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,540
So we'll take...

1266
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,040
Hold on.

1267
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,620
I'm just...

1268
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,860
Same eyes.

1269
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:35,940
Wait.

1270
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,560
What do you guys have?

1271
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,600
You guys have the same eyes, too.

1272
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,580
But you don't have the same feet!

1273
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,480
Wait.

1274
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:40,960
I had it?

1275
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,520
Oh.

1276
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,220
What did I do?

1277
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,140
Okay.

1278
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,580
Okay.

1279
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:44,900
Wait.

1280
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,700
I had it?

1281
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,600
I did?

1282
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,540
Where?

1283
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,840
No.

1284
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,120
I...

1285
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,300
Oh.

1286
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:50,860
Same feet.

1287
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,560
Oh!

1288
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,940
You're right.

1289
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,800
Same eyes.

1290
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,300
You got them all through!

1291
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,840
Good for you!

1292
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,520
Remember at the beginning when I was like, we need a lot of variety?

1293
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,320
It's puzzles like this.

1294
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:05,980
Yay!

1295
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,480
Oh!

1296
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,200
Oh!

1297
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:10,600
Oh!

1298
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,480
You can leave without them.

1299
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,640
It's kind of sad, though.

1300
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,540
Flute goes hard.

1301
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:25,960
Yeah.

1302
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,160
You can leave without all of them.

1303
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:30,620
It's so sad.

1304
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Mii-Win Pattern Recognition.

1305
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,480
Indeed!

1306
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,540
Indeed!

1307
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,540
Another relaxing campsite ready and waiting for Zoombinis!

1308
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,040
They'll meet at the rest.

1309
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,400
The darkest, most mysterious places in the world.

1310
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,060
I think we avoided the forest of the guys that are actually trying to kill us.

1311
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,960
So that's good.

1312
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,460
I love this guy.

1313
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,360
He loves his job.

1314
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,780
Are there any other clickables?

1315
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,040
Hey, that's just the same sound effect from the... Oh.

1316
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,580
I do remember those.

1317
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,500
Eww!

1318
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,640
This game is so goofy.

1319
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,500
Wait, so now we're at the lions.

1320
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,760
We have the lions.

1321
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,520
We have the crystals.

1322
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,900
We have another face matching game.

1323
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:35,780
I think that's it.

1324
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,780
Yeah, the bubbles.

1325
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,280
The bubbles.

1326
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,680
The bubbles is the... What's it called?

1327
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,800
I think that I called it... Wait.

1328
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,530
I don't remember this one.

1329
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:00,090
Oh!

1330
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,110
I have to go in order of their nose.

1331
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,610
Oh, okay.

1332
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,250
That's easy.

1333
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,510
Blue.

1334
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:14,780
Green.

1335
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,660
Do they have to have something similar though?

1336
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,680
Oh, I guess they do.

1337
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,640
What the...

1338
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,140
Wait, so they have to have...

1339
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,700
Oh, sorry.

1340
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,740
I just... For some reason I was only looking at the eyes.

1341
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,360
Okay, hold on.

1342
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,380
Oh no.

1343
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,960
It's like the same thing.

1344
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,840
I missed the blue?

1345
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:38,940
Oh, I did.

1346
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,480
You're so right.

1347
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,580
Thank you.

1348
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,680
I didn't even see it because it was partially hidden.

1349
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,860
Alright, so green...

1350
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,000
Green.

1351
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,540
Oh, I only have two left.

1352
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,960
I'm throwing, you guys.

1353
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,820
I'm throwing for real.

1354
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,240
I'm throwing for real.

1355
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,420
When it comes to red...

1356
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,160
Yeah, we can do this guy.

1357
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,760
And then this guy.

1358
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,940
I don't know if there has to be a similar thing to the previous person, but we'll just do it anyway.

1359
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:11,860
Red.

1360
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:18,910
Splendid job!

1361
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:19,970
Thank you, narrator!

1362
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:25,650
I'm so smart!

1363
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,130
What are you throwing?

1364
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,410
The ball...

1365
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,790
The ball in your court.

1366
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,390
Oh my gosh, I love the sounds in this one too.

1367
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,670
This one's fun.

1368
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,280
All of them are fun.

1369
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,780
I felt like that lion one was a little too easy though, right?

1370
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,000
So just be... Wow!

1371
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,520
It looks so fancy now!

1372
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,740
Oh my gosh!

1373
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,220
Okay, so...

1374
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,180
Look.

1375
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,460
We have to match...

1376
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,700
The reflection.

1377
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,020
Wait, but this is exactly them!

1378
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,320
Can I just put another guy on here?

1379
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,080
But...

1380
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,570
Wait, so if I do... Hold on.

1381
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,650
If I... Is it... If I combine?

1382
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,170
Or do I have to have the same...

1383
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:26,490
Same person?

1384
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,090
No, I have to combine, right?

1385
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,530
So we need a Cyclops with blue...

1386
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,810
Nose.

1387
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,930
Do we even have that?

1388
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:36,690
No.

1389
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,790
Wait, I actually don't remember this one.

1390
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:42,970
Match the characters, pull the lever.

1391
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,710
Do they change each time?

1392
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,430
Why is there a second seat?

1393
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,030
Wait!

1394
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,320
Oh, it does refresh!

1395
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,740
Wait, it did?

1396
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,920
I don't remember.

1397
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,340
I don't remember this one at all.

1398
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,760
I remember it, but I don't remember it.

1399
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,880
Why is there a second seat?

1400
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,580
I think...

1401
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,580
Maybe for...

1402
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,360
When you go through it again...

1403
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,920
Is what I'm thinking of.

1404
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,560
I think...

1405
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,240
I think...

1406
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,140
Like round two.

1407
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:16,840
Right?

1408
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,720
Bing!

1409
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,560
It refreshes every two zoomings.

1410
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,460
Okay, okay.

1411
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,860
So who's...

1412
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,540
This is our guy.

1413
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,260
This is our guy.

1414
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,360
The sound reminds me of the Indiana Jones ride.

1415
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,780
Nice.

1416
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,890
Who's our next victim?

1417
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,510
This guy.

1418
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,370
What's your name?

1419
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,430
Muscus.

1420
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,510
I'm Paco.

1421
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:02,930
Paco?

1422
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:07,450
No.

1423
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:07,830
Um...

1424
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:11,270
him.

1425
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:16,410
Whoa...

1426
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,180
Try putting two on?

1427
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:21,700
It wouldn't...

1428
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,300
It won't let me.

1429
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,240
It won't let me.

1430
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:23,620
I've tried.

1431
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,820
Who is... the next... you...

1432
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,560
Like it won't even let me drag... it won't even let me pick them up.

1433
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:40,900
I think it's for... I think it's for a future... future playthroughs.

1434
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,900
Because the puzzles do get like a... not more difficult, but...

1435
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,660
Well, I guess maybe it is a little bit more difficult.

1436
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,340
They realize you level up as a gamer.

1437
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:52,900
You know?

1438
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,860
I'll show you what happens when you get one wrong though.

1439
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,660
It's so sad.

1440
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,480
All the

1441
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,930
other puzzles give you...

1442
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:57,940
I don't even know her name.

1443
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,300
I killed her in cold blood.

1444
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,800
I didn't even know her name.

1445
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:08,960
All

1446
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,320
the other puzzles give me like a leeway.

1447
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,180
This one's just like, no, it's too easy.

1448
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,420
You need to know immediately.

1449
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,700
Oh my god.

1450
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,980
It's so...

1451
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,600
Oh my god.

1452
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,940
We killed her, you guys.

1453
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,860
We killed her.

1454
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,420
You're accomplices now.

1455
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,620
You also killed her with me.

1456
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,100
It is not just me.

1457
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:34,760
It is a we.

1458
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,880
This is us.

1459
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,600
We are in this together, okay?

1460
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,530
I knew you guys were gonna be like, we?

1461
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,050
Yes, we!

1462
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,130
We!

1463
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,170
I just got here.

1464
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,910
I'm so shocked right now.

1465
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:03,690
Because I've been showing you guys like kind of what happens when you miss the other ones.

1466
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,250
The frog one too?

1467
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:10,890
If you mess up on the frog one, the frogs just jump forever.

1468
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,990
Like they just don't move.

1469
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,850
Like your zumbinis don't die.

1470
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,850
They're just stuck in this never-ending like...

1471
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,310
It's kind of...

1472
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,230
It's not kind of.

1473
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,150
It's really messed up.

1474
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:25,430
Oh my gosh.

1475
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:31,970
Can you charge a ghost with murder?

1476
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,230
Oh my gosh.

1477
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:45,210
The game gets harder the more zumbinis you save when you do New Game Plus.

1478
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1479
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,070
That's what I do remember.

1480
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:59,910
Yeah, it may be we, but we'll get less time in the pen if we turn state's...

1481
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,070
If we turn state's evidence.

1482
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:02,610
Wait.

1483
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:03,750
No, no, no.

1484
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,010
No, no.

1485
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,290
No, there is no evidence.

1486
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,490
There's no evidence that the VOD is gone.

1487
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:22,930
Alrighty, buddy.

1488
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,030
You're our last one.

1489
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,510
Yay, we all survived.

1490
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,650
We all.

1491
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,970
We all survived.

1492
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:39,730
Bubbles.

1493
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,090
This one's fun too.

1494
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:48,770
They're all fun.

1495
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:48,970
This one's fun.

1496
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,940
It's always been 15.

1497
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,380
Woah.

1498
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,660
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

1499
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,100
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

1500
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,160
I don't remember what this means.

1501
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:02,540
Oh.

1502
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:03,920
That's a hairstyle.

1503
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,340
Okay, so if it's...

1504
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,780
Okay, so hairstyle man.

1505
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,120
This guy has to go on this one.

1506
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,980
Because otherwise he's going to...

1507
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,000
He's going to get eaten.

1508
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,520
So musk goose.

1509
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,260
Go, Maskus.

1510
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:22,700
Go.

1511
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,380
Go, Maskus.

1512
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,840
And go, Kaislu.

1513
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,560
Go, my children.

1514
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,400
Go, my children.

1515
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:39,980
Frofa.

1516
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,340
Leave you to... Maybe I should have... Well, we know it's going to be fine.

1517
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,760
We know it's going to be fine.

1518
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:51,600
I was going to say, maybe I should have let just one guy go and tested it before I let all of them go, but, you know.

1519
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,440
Arigato, arigato.

1520
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,080
Chuu.

1521
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:08,800
Okay.

1522
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,580
Now, sad eye.

1523
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,620
I won't let you go.

1524
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,080
Rubrisco.

1525
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,020
Oh.

1526
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,700
Girl, I'm working towards my Master's in Criminal Psychology.

1527
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:31,700
You were sort of giving me content to feed to add to a report I'm doing.

1528
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,760
Watching VTubers is educational, you guys.

1529
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,100
Didn't you know?

1530
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:39,620
Okay.

1531
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,560
He goes... I'll go that way.

1532
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,380
Yeah, he's fine.

1533
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,520
We just have to... Oh.

1534
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,820
Maybe I should have done a glasses.

1535
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,200
Okay.

1536
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,560
This time, I'm going to do this glasses.

1537
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,320
I know, Chuu.

1538
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,760
We're going to have to switch between the two.

1539
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, we'll alternate.

1540
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:04,700
Yeah, yeah.

1541
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:05,480
Okay.

1542
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,340
So now, it's a cool glasses.

1543
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,100
Denise!

1544
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,660
Oh my god.

1545
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,140
At least Denise is alive, right?

1546
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,140
Okay.

1547
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,180
Now, glasses.

1548
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,480
Oh my god.

1549
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,840
It's so crunchy.

1550
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:26,900
Okay.

1551
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,600
Now, sunglasses.

1552
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,960
Now, glasses.

1553
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,580
Now,

1554
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,500
sunglasses.

1555
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,790
And now, everybody else.

1556
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:49,210
And now, everybody else.

1557
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,460
Wait.

1558
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,040
Isn't Kay... Isn't she the one that fell down the hole?

1559
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,380
She's alive!

1560
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,620
You guys, she's alive!

1561
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,100
She's the one that fell down!

1562
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:05,360
We're fine!

1563
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,820
How do I play this?

1564
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,140
On Steam.

1565
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:17,960
Everything's all good.

1566
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:20,920
Yippee!

1567
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,320
I know.

1568
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,540
Thank you, narrator!

1569
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,580
Wait.

1570
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,300
Was that the last one?

1571
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,420
I don't remember anyone after this.

1572
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,000
Have we reached the Promised Land?

1573
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,360
One.

1574
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,600
Two.

1575
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:46,760
Three.

1576
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:47,560
Three.

1577
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,200
Oh, whoops.

1578
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:48,600
Sorry.

1579
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,200
Oh!

1580
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,260
No!

1581
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,710
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1582
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:03,110
It's okay.

1583
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,030
We'll just have to play again.

1584
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:05,730
We have...

1585
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,230
A wind bill.

1586
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:20,080
This wind bill was wrought to honor the Zumbinis who calmed Captain Cajun, rode tattooed toads, and knew how to network.

1587
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
When the traveling was not so easy.

1588
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:22,980
Today.

1589
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,040
Look at our guys!

1590
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:27,840
Katie...

1591
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:43,080
This clock tower was constructed for the Zumbinis who ambled past allergic cliffs, cruised on by stone-cold caves, and appeased Arno, the almost omnivorous.

1592
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,300
Who are these people?

1593
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,540
I'm gonna show you!

1594
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,060
I'm gonna talk to you!

1595
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:57,380
All right.

1596
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,580
Let's get it started!

1597
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,140
Oh!

1598
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,440
Oh my god!

1599
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,480
I love the sound of this!

1600
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,880
I love it so much!

1601
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,020
Oh, it's so good!

1602
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:09,100
You can practice the music, guys.

1603
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:09,760
Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

1604
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:16,940
You can also practice some of the levels that are on different difficulties too.

1605
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,120
What?

1606
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,340
That's so cool.

1607
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,180
Very, very hard.

1608
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,360
Wow.

1609
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,440
Oh, so hard.

1610
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,560
So that's why I said not so easy.

1611
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,460
Because we were on the easy level.

1612
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,760
See, and we have...

1613
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:33,760
16.

1614
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,220
We still have 384.

1615
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,440
Is that what that means?

1616
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:39,680
Wait.

1617
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,880
She's here!

1618
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,720
You guys, she is alive.

1619
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:47,740
Rebro!

1620
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,080
She's right there!

1621
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,100
See?

1622
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,000
She's alive.

1623
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:56,560
She's alive.

1624
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,600
Man.

1625
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,540
She lives.

1626
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,340
We're fine.

1627
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:09,560
Oh, okay.

1628
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,100
My bad.

1629
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,360
The big, the bad, and the hungry.

1630
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,640
So now we're gonna go to the campsite.

1631
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,440
I thought there was another...

1632
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,860
Split, but I guess there's just the one.

1633
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,860
So we have a whole other set of puzzles down here.

1634
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,420
Isn't that so exciting?

1635
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:34,410
Scrooge!

1636
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,720
Scrooge!

1637
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,040
Scrooge must live at all costs, you guys.

1638
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,000
If anything happens to Scrooge, I'm gonna cry.

1639
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,300
Oh, you are too similar.

1640
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,640
Ape.

1641
01:09:58,660 --> 01:09:59,860
You're also similar.

1642
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:01,700
Rhian.

1643
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,300
Oh, I think it...

1644
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,160
Zagla.

1645
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:08,480
Zagla.

1646
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,080
Yeah.

1647
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:10,820
Cool deal.

1648
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:10,900
Cool deal.

1649
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,020
So prude.

1650
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,360
Daiso!

1651
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,760
You're back!

1652
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:19,940
Oh my gosh, you guys!

1653
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,820
We got Daiso back!

1654
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,820
We got Daiso back!

1655
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:23,440
Let's go!

1656
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,300
Scrooge.

1657
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:32,220
Aflok.

1658
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:34,980
Leleblir.

1659
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,340
Adrawee.

1660
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,520
Adrawee.

1661
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,820
Ruhwabu.

1662
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,660
Ruhwabu.

1663
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,840
What am I missing?

1664
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,900
We have no...

1665
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,760
Skates.

1666
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:53,800
Macy.

1667
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:57,960
Doku.

1668
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,320
No, we need skates.

1669
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,840
I read...

1670
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,480
I read this wrong, I think.

1671
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,640
Hi, Aura?

1672
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,780
Oh my god!

1673
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:16,440
Hello!

1674
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,440
I played this when I was a kid.

1675
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,200
Me too.

1676
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,440
Hello, hello, hello.

1677
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,100
Thanks for dropping by!

1678
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,620
What else am I missing?

1679
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,940
We have...

1680
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,540
We need more pony tail.

1681
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,200
Bos... Boswasku.

1682
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,900
I don't know the name of the game.

1683
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:42,740
I'm gonna have to find another one.

1684
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,740
You know what, hard mode.

1685
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,280
Oh.

1686
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,140
Oh, okay.

1687
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,820
I thought it was just the one guy.

1688
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,160
It's gonna be like...

1689
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:51,640
Hard mode!

1690
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,800
We won't decide them at all!

1691
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,320
And if it was just one man that walked out...

1692
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,180
it would be so funny...

1693
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:04,080
A very long sermon.

1694
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,640
I would always do the frog one.

1695
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:13,980
So, I'll be honest, I don't remember the second route so much.

1696
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,420
I remember the hotel one, but I don't... Oh, and the forest where they're trying to kill us.

1697
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,520
I don't remember anything.

1698
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,020
I don't know.

1699
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,000
I don't remember the other ones.

1700
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:27,800
Fleece!

1701
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,140
We're not Fleece!

1702
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:31,820
Okay.

1703
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,200
Is it glasses?

1704
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,280
No glasses again?

1705
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,660
It wouldn't be so simple, right?

1706
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,820
Wait, are we on easy mode again still?

1707
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,140
I don't know.

1708
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,860
We're not glasses.

1709
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,940
I said glasses, no glasses.

1710
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,540
It was eye... Oh!

1711
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:52,920
Okay.

1712
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,800
It's not the hair.

1713
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,940
But they have nothing else in common.

1714
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:08,040
This guy is like almost an identical twin, so...

1715
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:09,660
Okay.

1716
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,060
Doesn't help us so much.

1717
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,340
Thanks for the dough and all.

1718
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:20,240
After trying to win a cinema role for over an hour in a UFO catcher crane game, I finally made it for Zoombini's nostalgia time.

1719
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,260
I don't blame you.

1720
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,220
I'm so bad at crane games though.

1721
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,040
Oh!

1722
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,320
Do you guys mind if I have a snack?

1723
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,680
I... Oh my gosh.

1724
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:40,600
At... at the airport when I was coming home, they sometimes have like these pop-up stores that like sell little snacks that you can... that you can get.

1725
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,360
And this one was called the Butter Butler.

1726
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,940
And it's a fancier little butter cake.

1727
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,600
It's so...

1728
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,960
Butter Finacier.

1729
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,640
Butter Butler.

1730
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,000
Oh, that's just his butter butler.

1731
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,540
Finas... Fin... Finacier.

1732
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:06,780
Fin... Fin... Fin... Fin... Fin... Fin... Financiers.

1733
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,880
The butter fanciers.

1734
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,800
And they're so good.

1735
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,900
It's like a little...

1736
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,140
I'm just smelling it right now.

1737
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,680
It smells like...

1738
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,740
It smells like a butter... like a waffle.

1739
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,680
Like when you put butter on a waffle.

1740
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,460
Oh, it smells so good.

1741
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,760
If you can look up the Butter Butler.

1742
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,700
It's so yummy.

1743
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,920
It's so good.

1744
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,440
Okay.

1745
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,500
Let's try eyes.

1746
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,000
Okay.

1747
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,480
Okay.

1748
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:45,880
Trying her.

1749
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,380
Okay.

1750
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,040
Trying you.

1751
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:52,760
Daiso.

1752
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,540
Don't let us down, Daiso.

1753
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,480
Very good, Daiso.

1754
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:01,480
Okay.

1755
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,320
That sounds good.

1756
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,140
It's really good.

1757
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,210
Okay.

1758
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:14,250
We got through all the ones that we were sure of.

1759
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:18,350
What about you?

1760
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:19,450
No.

1761
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,330
No.

1762
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,370
No.

1763
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:25,930
Mm -hmm.

1764
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,690
Mm-hmm.

1765
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,490
You.

1766
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:33,070
You.

1767
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:39,230
He's allergic to... he's allergic to nerds for real.

1768
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,210
You like glasses though.

1769
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:43,890
You're a man of culture.

1770
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:45,870
What about you?

1771
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:46,730
Huh?

1772
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:48,710
What?

1773
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:55,210
Not the... you're even allergic to... to... Cyclops?

1774
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:56,210
It's so sad.

1775
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,130
You have no culture.

1776
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,610
Splendid job!

1777
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,430
Splendid job!

1778
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:07,910
Are these noses?

1779
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,110
I just... I can't tell.

1780
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:10,630
Hmm.

1781
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:17,170
These stone guards have their rules, so do proceed with skill.

1782
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:20,230
Zumbini's one guard won't allow.

1783
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:22,550
The other guard surely will.

1784
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:28,050
Splendid!

1785
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,430
Strange looking bunch!

1786
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:35,370
Where do they all come from?

1787
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,550
Sorry, we just keep passing through.

1788
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:40,470
Alright.

1789
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:44,510
Is he going to be so sad this time?

1790
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,550
Can't let you in.

1791
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:50,210
Why not?

1792
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:51,650
Why?

1793
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:53,930
Like, I need... come on.

1794
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:54,770
Sure.

1795
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:56,210
Okay,

1796
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:02,510
let's try the glasses.

1797
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:04,050
Enjoy yourself.

1798
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:10,470
I mean... what?

1799
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,450
He has friends now.

1800
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:15,330
Maybe this... he had a change of heart.

1801
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:16,910
Is it glasses?

1802
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,550
Is he a glasses enjoyer?

1803
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,430
Hello.

1804
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,770
Oh my gosh.

1805
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,870
Hello, Mr. Stone.

1806
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:24,970
Wow.

1807
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,450
Don't mind if I do.

1808
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:27,990
Yeah.

1809
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:31,090
Okay, well that's all the glasses we got.

1810
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:33,970
Let's try...

1811
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:39,290
Wait, that means...

1812
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,410
We must be selective about our clientele.

1813
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,710
What does that mean?

1814
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,330
What's wrong with A-Floke?

1815
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:46,230
Huh?

1816
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:48,250
I think you're just being very discriminatory.

1817
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,250
Don't be shy.

1818
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,910
Kinda.

1819
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:58,530
I think I'm... I think I'm... I think I like the... the rock.

1820
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,670
I think I'm like... like wow for this...

1821
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:04,870
Okay.

1822
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:05,950
Have a good time.

1823
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:06,890
Thank you.

1824
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:11,450
I mean, he's just got a bit of a career... I think I misjudged him before.

1825
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:12,250
You know?

1826
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:13,570
Oh.

1827
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:15,330
Nope.

1828
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,200
So it's hair.

1829
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,920
It's not the eyes.

1830
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:23,260
Interesting.

1831
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,840
Go ahead.

1832
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:26,460
Go ahead.

1833
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,320
Enjoy yourself.

1834
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,340
Yeah.

1835
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:31,600
Okay, so it's the hair instead.

1836
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,620
So these guys messy hair and ponytail.

1837
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,360
Messy hair or...

1838
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,160
Sure.

1839
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,500
I don't... I don't even know what to call that.

1840
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,280
A single strand.

1841
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,300
Hello.

1842
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:51,640
When can we start sending the Akasupas?

1843
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,540
Why are you so eager to do that?

1844
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,660
But also I think it might be...

1845
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:57,660
You'll do.

1846
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,420
Get right up.

1847
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:02,920
I think it might be a little while because YouTube says that I need more watch hours.

1848
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,820
So even after today's stream, I'm not so sure.

1849
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:09,380
Okay.

1850
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,340
So Prue?

1851
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,040
Wait.

1852
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,160
And so these are the guys too.

1853
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:15,480
Daiso?

1854
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,000
Welcome.

1855
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,520
Thank you.

1856
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,580
Oh my gosh.

1857
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,540
He's just got so much charisma.

1858
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:21,820
You know?

1859
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,100
Sure.

1860
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Thank you, sir.

1861
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:24,720
Oh my gosh.

1862
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:25,040
Wait.

1863
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,460
It's literally the opposite.

1864
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:26,960
Hello.

1865
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:27,740
Hello.

1866
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,060
It's the opposite of last time.

1867
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:30,820
Okay.

1868
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:31,200
By me.

1869
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:31,600
Don't be shy.

1870
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:37,760
Sure.

1871
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,080
Okay.

1872
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:39,900
It's the other side.

1873
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,100
Okay.

1874
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,800
Oh my god.

1875
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,440
Hello.

1876
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,040
Okay.

1877
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,000
Hip hip zumbini!

1878
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,960
Hip hip zumbini!

1879
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:49,900
Hip hip zumbini!

1880
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,060
I love... I love the...

1881
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:55,480
Okay.

1882
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,920
This is the cool kids club.

1883
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,180
Look how cool they look.

1884
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,400
And this is everybody else.

1885
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,760
The narrator is the best guy ever.

1886
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,520
Hip hip zumbini!

1887
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:08,400
And so our brave travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland...

1888
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:08,440
I'm so excited.

1889
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:08,960
...until they meet...

1890
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:09,680
What the hell just happened?

1891
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,080
...Arno, the almost omni...

1892
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:12,460
...pulverous...

1893
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:15,300
...one very hungry pizza troll.

1894
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,540
One hungry pizza troll.

1895
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,100
Fleens?

1896
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,780
You're not fleens.

1897
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,040
I think we're still on easy mode.

1898
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,800
Whatever you are.

1899
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:31,040
Make me a pizza!

1900
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:32,680
Okay.

1901
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,400
Oh, it's up to you, buddy.

1902
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,500
All right.

1903
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,120
We're gonna go down the line.

1904
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,600
Actually, we're gonna... we're gonna make this a little interesting.

1905
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,300
You know, we're gonna try two combos at once.

1906
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,760
Something on that I don't like.

1907
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,380
Something on that I don't like.

1908
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,800
Sometimes he will actually just get, like, a plain ass...

1909
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,940
...like, no cheese pizza.

1910
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,120
He said the thing!

1911
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:09,720
More!

1912
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,020
More!

1913
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:10,420
More!

1914
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:10,840
More!

1915
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:11,100
More!

1916
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:11,360
More!

1917
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:11,520
More!

1918
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:11,700
More!

1919
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:11,780
More!

1920
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:11,880
More!

1921
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:11,960
More!

1922
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,060
More!

1923
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:12,120
More!

1924
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:12,180
More!

1925
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,160
Okay.

1926
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,200
He's begging for it.

1927
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,260
Sorry, mister.

1928
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:21,360
Okay, so he doesn't like mushrooms.

1929
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,160
More!

1930
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:23,520
More!

1931
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:23,740
More!

1932
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:23,960
More!

1933
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:24,160
More!

1934
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:24,380
More!

1935
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:24,500
More!

1936
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:24,660
More!

1937
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:24,740
More!

1938
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:24,840
More!

1939
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,000
More!

1940
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,000
More!

1941
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,880
That's how you... That's how you really get the girls, you know?

1942
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,980
I'm supposed to be working, but this child's game is too engaging.

1943
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,200
Go work!

1944
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:38,820
Okay.

1945
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:40,660
Bellbackers.

1946
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,040
Wow!

1947
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,220
Only three tries!

1948
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,040
I think we're a genius.

1949
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,200
I think we're a genius.

1950
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,140
Thank you.

1951
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,000
Oh, sorry narrator.

1952
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,260
Ah, base camp one.

1953
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,680
What's this?

1954
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:21,880
Okay, bye-bye.

1955
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,220
Nope.

1956
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,680
We are no time to stop, Zoobinis.

1957
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,740
No, no rest.

1958
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:29,720
No rest allowed.

1959
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,100
The fleens are the guys actually trying to kill us.

1960
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,660
The fleens?

1961
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:45,820
These guys.

1962
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,500
These guys are actually trying to kill us.

1963
01:22:53,360 --> 01:23:04,000
Okay, so you have to put a guy out and have... I don't remember how this one goes.

1964
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:10,280
I think certain traits a Zoobini has will have a certain guy jump off.

1965
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,440
But you need these guys to jump... I don't remember how this one... wait, hold on.

1966
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,740
There's no sense leaving it up to chance.

1967
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,560
Lure the fleens off the tree branch.

1968
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,960
Oh yeah, we are not so easy.

1969
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,840
Feeling stuck?

1970
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:23,440
Wait, no.

1971
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,940
No, we're gonna get this ourselves.

1972
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,960
We don't... we don't... I'm sorry, I didn't read it.

1973
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,860
You are fleens.

1974
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:32,640
No, we're not.

1975
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,460
The tree guy just said fleens.

1976
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:36,920
You're not fleens.

1977
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,460
We're Zoobinis.

1978
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,160
We're not the fleens.

1979
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,160
These are the fleens.

1980
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,920
They are so high tech for like...

1981
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,400
Is this... is this Metal Gear?

1982
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,320
I like that sound.

1983
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:59,400
Man, I hated this one.

1984
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,440
I don't remember how it works, so...

1985
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,600
No, no, Skrookey.

1986
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:04,700
Skrookey, get behind me.

1987
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,120
Skrookey, get behind...

1988
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,600
Skrookey, stay back there.

1989
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,820
Okay, we're gonna get a Floak.

1990
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:29,250
Okay, so basically we only have a couple chances because they're gonna slide eventually and fall off the thing.

1991
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,010
So...

1992
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:33,150
Maybe...

1993
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:38,370
It was either her glasses or the color of her nose or...

1994
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,070
Okay, so aggressive.

1995
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:41,750
I know the fleens are crazy.

1996
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,670
Let's try one completely different.

1997
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:45,230
Robo...

1998
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,510
Okay...

1999
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:56,690
The hair is correct.

2000
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:58,130
The hair was correct, yes.

2001
01:24:58,710 --> 01:24:59,290
Oh!

2002
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:01,210
Okay.

2003
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:02,950
So we need...

2004
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,230
You.

2005
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:07,610
Like that.

2006
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,870
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2007
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,150
Okay, okay.

2008
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:17,270
Okay.

2009
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:19,810
So...

2010
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:20,730
We need...

2011
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:22,130
No.

2012
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,450
No, no, Skrookey.

2013
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:25,610
No, no, no.

2014
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:27,310
No, no, no.

2015
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,550
No, no, no.

2016
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:30,270
I won't allow it.

2017
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:31,170
I won't allow it.

2018
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:35,910
Oh!

2019
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:37,110
Uh-oh.

2020
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,330
Oh, that's right.

2021
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:43,250
Wait, how am I supposed to get the...

2022
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:46,170
No, Skrookey.

2023
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:47,710
No, no, Skrookey.

2024
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:52,290
No, no, Skrookey.

2025
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,990
Daiso!

2026
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:57,970
Oh!

2027
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:03,730
Skrookey, no!

2028
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:07,570
Yeah, because it's the same legs.

2029
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:08,930
Oh my god.

2030
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:09,790
Oh my god.

2031
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,050
Skrookey.

2032
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:13,810
Skrookey has to go.

2033
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:18,130
Skrookey has to go.

2034
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,410
He's looking around.

2035
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,590
He doesn't even want to look at me.

2036
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,270
He's so scared.

2037
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:24,590
He's like, Mom!

2038
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,210
Mom, what are you picking me up for?

2039
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,030
Mom, why are you leading me over into the danger zone?

2040
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:35,360
Mom!

2041
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,180
Mom, I'm scared!

2042
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:36,800
No, can I?

2043
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:37,720
Oh, I'm trying to pull back.

2044
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,740
Oh, Mom, no, please!

2045
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,040
Please, Mom, you said you would protect me!

2046
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,000
Scroogey!

2047
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,320
Here comes the awesome music, yeah!

2048
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:56,600
Yeah!

2049
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,100
All right, Scroogey in the lead!

2050
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,480
Nice!

2051
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,420
Hurry, Zumpinis!

2052
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:21,500
Ula, the forest's foremost, and perhaps only, band leader!

2053
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,040
Is about to begin rehearsals!

2054
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:28,340
She'll be closing the hotel for the night, so scamper into a room!

2055
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:29,280
Okay.

2056
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,480
We believe in Scroogey, yeah.

2057
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,820
I don't remember how this works.

2058
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,140
Yes?

2059
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,640
Ah, yes!

2060
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:38,820
I'll be right down.

2061
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,880
Make yourselves cozy.

2062
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,960
Yeah, but you're also picky.

2063
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,540
Just when I was starting rehearsal...

2064
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,040
Welcome!

2065
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,800
You're just in time for tomorrow's concerto!

2066
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,200
Okay.

2067
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,360
Help yourselves.

2068
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,320
Help yourselves to a room.

2069
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,120
Okay.

2070
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:53,960
I got rehearsal.

2071
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:54,940
Go ahead.

2072
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,460
Find yourselves a room.

2073
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:57,340
Where did she go?

2074
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,580
Why has she talked over herself, even?

2075
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:03,860
Hmm.

2076
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,440
I'm glad I got to see you again.

2077
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:13,400
Thank you so much for the live stream!

2078
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,160
Thank you for watching!

2079
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:19,660
Hmm.

2080
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,820
Okay, so...

2081
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:21,780
All

2082
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:27,250
right?

2083
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:28,390
All right.

2084
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:28,570
Oh, my God.

2085
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:30,770
Who's sharing a room with Scroogey tonight?

2086
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:38,550
Oh, and we do have like a kind of...

2087
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,410
That clock is terrifying.

2088
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:42,110
Oh, my gosh.

2089
01:28:42,270 --> 01:28:47,470
The clock is giving like over the garden wall vibes.

2090
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,450
It's so scary.

2091
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:52,150
Let's put you over here.

2092
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,000
Oh, is it the eyes?

2093
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:02,020
Okay.

2094
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,940
I don't remember what... is it the eyes?

2095
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,020
Is it eyes?

2096
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:12,720
Is it just eyes?

2097
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,220
Is that it?

2098
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,800
Is it so simple?

2099
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,260
Am I overthinking it?

2100
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,760
Am I overthinking it?

2101
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,340
As I do with everything?

2102
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,940
I think so.

2103
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,560
Because there's only this...

2104
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,840
Yeah, there's only five slides.

2105
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,260
I guess I could have made it anything.

2106
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:38,580
Maybe.

2107
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:39,660
I could have made it eyes.

2108
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,420
I could have made it hair.

2109
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,220
Oops, I made it hair.

2110
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:49,580
Sorry, I might have said hair and so I put it in there.

2111
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,260
Oh, Rhiann is all by themselves.

2112
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:55,060
Sorry.

2113
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:57,740
Oh my god, it's spooky.

2114
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,980
See you in the morning.

2115
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:19,330
This is the paint splatter one!

2116
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:27,210
Strike the targets one and all and watch for a pattern on Mudball Wall.

2117
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:28,290
Mudball Wall.

2118
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,790
Best minigame?

2119
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:34,470
You guys like this one?

2120
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,890
The sounds in this one are immaculate.

2121
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:37,850
Oh!

2122
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,230
Oh!

2123
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:40,650
Did you hear that?

2124
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:41,170
Oh!

2125
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:44,130
My god, it's so good.

2126
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:45,970
Wait, I don't remember how to do this one though.

2127
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:49,630
Wait, I don't remember how this one works.

2128
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:50,730
Wait, I don't remember how this one works.

2129
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:52,930
So we pick a color.

2130
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:55,690
Oh my god!

2131
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:58,070
And we pick a shape.

2132
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:03,070
And we have to hit like here.

2133
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:03,990
And we have to hit like here.

2134
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:04,510
Right?

2135
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:08,030
And we have to hit like here.

2136
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:08,030
Right?

2137
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,030
I hate it so much.

2138
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,330
Really?

2139
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,210
You don't like it?

2140
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:13,810
I kind of love it.

2141
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:15,490
I kind of love it.

2142
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:16,030
I don't remember.

2143
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:16,930
I don't remember.

2144
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,150
Okay, so we'll figure out.

2145
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:21,630
Let's see.

2146
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:22,170
Okay, so we'll figure out.

2147
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:22,170
Let's see.

2148
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:22,670
Red.

2149
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,210
Nice!

2150
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:27,950
Okay, so this is the star area.

2151
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:30,010
Is this triangle?

2152
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:31,110
Let's just try it.

2153
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:32,630
No.

2154
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:37,030
And also we need to figure out what this row is.

2155
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:40,010
And also we need to figure out what this row is.

2156
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:40,130
Oh!

2157
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:40,610
Okay.

2158
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:43,590
So it's yellow something.

2159
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:44,530
Yellow square.

2160
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:45,670
I'm calling it now.

2161
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:46,810
For the three.

2162
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,230
Or this three.

2163
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:49,210
Never mind.

2164
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:52,630
Oh wait, we could do diamond.

2165
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:58,830
Oh wait, we could do diamond.

2166
01:31:58,830 --> 01:31:58,910
Nice.

2167
01:31:58,910 --> 01:31:59,210
Nice.

2168
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:05,210
Nice.

2169
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:05,550
Alright.

2170
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:06,650
Get in there guys.

2171
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:07,710
Hurry up.

2172
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,430
Hurry up.

2173
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:08,930
Time is money.

2174
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:14,790
Of the demo I played as a kid, this was my favorite.

2175
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:16,350
They had a demo of this?

2176
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:19,850
Nice.

2177
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:20,170
Nice.

2178
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:34,650
I love how conflicted the chat is on on these these sounds.

2179
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:35,510
It's so funny.

2180
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:44,390
Okay, I think we can we basically have all the information we need to to complete this.

2181
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:47,770
Piece of cake, baby!

2182
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:49,830
Well, except for this one.

2183
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:52,650
Everything else piece of cake.

2184
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,690
I have no idea how this works.

2185
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:00,430
Okay.

2186
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:02,710
So each row is a color.

2187
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,690
And each column is a shape.

2188
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:08,090
So you just have to see these are star shapes.

2189
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:09,530
These are triangle shapes.

2190
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:10,370
See?

2191
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:13,290
Let's try green.

2192
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:14,950
I don't know.

2193
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:15,910
I'm feeling green.

2194
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:18,090
Oh.

2195
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,790
Okay.

2196
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:22,170
This is a wild guess.

2197
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:24,970
I think I'm getting a wild streak.

2198
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:26,170
Like a little wild hair.

2199
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:28,130
I think it might be pink.

2200
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:31,250
Genius.

2201
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:32,770
Genius.

2202
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:40,830
Nailed it.

2203
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,660
And look.

2204
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,060
And you run out of ink.

2205
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:49,880
See here?

2206
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,780
You can run out.

2207
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,440
So...

2208
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,540
It could be... Oh my gosh.

2209
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,420
Can you imagine if Skrookey was left behind?

2210
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,640
I don't even want to think about the thought.

2211
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,080
I don't even want to think about the thought.

2212
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:04,920
Yay!

2213
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,740
Well done, oh wise and trusted guide.

2214
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:09,980
Thank you.

2215
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,320
I'm wise and trusted.

2216
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,200
You guys.

2217
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,880
I'm wise and trusted.

2218
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:21,900
How do you get ink refills?

2219
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:22,440
You don't.

2220
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,500
You run out of ink, you just have to leave them behind.

2221
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,520
This goes so hard.

2222
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,020
Amazing indeed.

2223
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,160
Another relaxing She's gonna have to stay here.

2224
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:52,200
campsite ready and waiting for Zumbinis.

2225
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:52,980
She's...

2226
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,700
And they'll need their rest.

2227
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,860
She's uh...

2228
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,100
She's watching over the camp, you know?

2229
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,740
The journey is yet to come!

2230
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:10,940
Swap her in.

2231
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,600
Nah, she's good.

2232
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:20,900
Throughout these gloomy mountains, strange carvings left by ancient peoples are everywhere.

2233
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,920
Spooky.

2234
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:26,960
Oh my gosh.

2235
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,720
Okay, next time we play this, we're gonna go on hard.

2236
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,220
Should we?

2237
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,140
We'll just go on the hardest mode, I think.

2238
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:33,500
Oh!

2239
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,120
What the heck is that?

2240
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:39,540
Oh!

2241
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:40,520
Those are the hair!

2242
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,200
Okay.

2243
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,740
So it's like this hair...

2244
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,300
We have a lot of these guys.

2245
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,240
We have so many single hairs.

2246
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,200
And then ponytail.

2247
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:54,680
Right?

2248
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,420
That is a pony.

2249
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,540
And this is the high.

2250
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:56,880
Okay.

2251
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,920
We have one pony...

2252
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,220
Oh!

2253
01:35:59,240 --> 01:35:59,840
Two ponytails.

2254
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:03,620
And we have...

2255
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,760
Actually, I wanna see...

2256
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,520
Oh!

2257
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,740
They don't need to be...

2258
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,960
connected to one another.

2259
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:11,820
To one another.

2260
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,860
So that makes things so much easier.

2261
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,960
I was making things more difficult on myself.

2262
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,940
Than it really needed to be.

2263
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I think you all know who's gonna be in the front.

2264
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,700
Our man, Skrookey.

2265
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:28,800
Wait.

2266
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,100
His name is Skrookey?

2267
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,040
I thought his name was Skrookey.

2268
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,660
It's Skrookey this whole time?

2269
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,200
You lied to me?

2270
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,340
I thought it was Skrookey.

2271
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:43,620
What?

2272
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,100
Just Skrookey?

2273
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,540
She finally noticed.

2274
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,520
It's been his reflection.

2275
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,060
It will give them crystal-slamming protection.

2276
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,980
Let's just pretend he's still Skrookey.

2277
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,780
Girl boss gaslit herself.

2278
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,040
I can't believe!

2279
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,740
I cannot believe that I just...

2280
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,880
That I just made that up.

2281
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,280
I stole their identi- Like I stole...

2282
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,800
This whole time they probably just like...

2283
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,980
She can't even get my name right.

2284
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,760
Gosh this mid-girl sucks.

2285
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,520
She can't even...

2286
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:43,760
She can't even read.

2287
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:47,900
Sorry.

2288
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,840
Yeah, he's still Skrookey in our hearts.

2289
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,340
Right guys?

2290
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,400
Skrookey.

2291
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,300
Skrookey.

2292
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,200
Skrookey.

2293
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:01,000
Skrookey.

2294
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:01,880
Skrookey.

2295
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:02,780
Skrookey.

2296
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:02,980
Skrookey.

2297
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:03,380
Skrookey.

2298
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:04,520
Literacy is overrated.

2299
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:05,200
True.

2300
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:09,300
So true bestie.

2301
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,220
Hmm...

2302
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:21,580
Skrookey in the streets.

2303
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,160
Skrookey in the sheets.

2304
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:30,160
He did have that- Wait we need to ask Who is- Her?

2305
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:31,820
Coldio.

2306
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:36,020
How was he in the hotel room, I wonder.

2307
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,680
Thanks for the donut!

2308
01:38:56,980 --> 01:39:00,500
Edutainment gives proving its value by finally teaching victory.

2309
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:07,860
Just noticed that you had a messy... Sorry, I missed this one earlier, AJ.

2310
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,620
You have messy hair, sunglasses, red nose, spring Zumbini in your party.

2311
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:12,300
This one?

2312
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,500
That combo was always my favorite as a kid.

2313
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,500
I think his name was Edawanka.

2314
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,740
You even remember his name!

2315
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,420
Wow, true Zumbini fan.

2316
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:28,460
My favorite combo was glasses and this hair and the...

2317
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,700
Either the roller skates or the...

2318
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:33,600
Or the...

2319
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:34,980
Two wheels like that.

2320
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,920
That was my favorite combo.

2321
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,700
Because I always thought it looked like me.

2322
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:47,220
You finally acknowledge me after all this time.

2323
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,700
Tsuruki, I'm so sorry.

2324
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:51,720
I'm so sorry.

2325
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,460
Favorite hair color?

2326
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,780
You can't change the hair color.

2327
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,260
Right?

2328
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,040
Right?

2329
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:14,190
Oh, it's your favorite.

2330
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:19,270
Oh, nose color.

2331
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:20,630
Oh, it was blue.

2332
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:21,650
It was blue.

2333
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,200
Why does this get more difficult for me the less Zumbinis I have?

2334
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:37,700
Why can't I find him?

2335
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,400
Hello?

2336
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:42,840
Oh, there you are.

2337
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,860
Hip hip Zumbini.

2338
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,700
Hip hip Zumbini.

2339
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,580
This is so funny.

2340
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:02,120
This is so funny.

2341
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:06,780
Beady eyes.

2342
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:08,700
Little beady guy.

2343
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,360
I don't remember this eye style in the original.

2344
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:17,760
Why is the narrator so awesome?

2345
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,000
He's so funny.

2346
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,000
He's like...

2347
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:28,040
He's kind of like... if the guy from the Stanley Parable was in a good game.

2348
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,060
And like happy about it, you know?

2349
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:37,880
Not to say... wait, that makes it sound like the Stanley Parable is not a good game.

2350
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:38,680
Oh wait, I was right.

2351
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,220
It is a good game.

2352
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,200
Sorry, it is a good game.

2353
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,300
You know what I mean?

2354
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:49,060
It just makes me feel like he's like...

2355
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,920
Oh yeah, I'm enjoying my life now.

2356
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,480
I hate the Stanley Parable.

2357
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,220
I should play it.

2358
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:03,340
The last time I tried playing it, the game crashed on me.

2359
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,820
So I never actually got to beat it.

2360
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,520
Search first for traps.

2361
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,620
So easy to miss.

2362
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:21,860
To get Zoombinis across Bubble Wonder Abyss.

2363
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,880
Thanks for the donut.

2364
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,340
When I was a kid, my mom would buy these big styrofoam eggs from the craft store.

2365
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,700
And I'd paint them blue and decorate them like Zoombinis.

2366
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:37,800
We found one under the porch when my parents moved from a family home.

2367
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:39,720
And when they retired 30 years later.

2368
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:41,240
Oh my gosh.

2369
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:42,600
That's insane.

2370
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,180
Wait, this is the same exact pattern as before.

2371
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:48,980
Okay, so all our scruffy heads.

2372
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:50,760
Scruffy.

2373
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,920
I'm gonna turn this one down because it does hurt.

2374
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,400
Scruffy.

2375
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:01,620
Scruffy.

2376
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:02,880
Scruffy.

2377
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:08,440
Scruffy.

2378
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,180
Scruffy.

2379
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,540
Alright, first.

2380
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:21,900
Ponytail.

2381
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:22,600
Right?

2382
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:23,560
She goes...

2383
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,280
Yeah.

2384
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:27,000
Yeah, ponytail first.

2385
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:29,460
Ponytail.

2386
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:30,820
Wait.

2387
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:32,900
Uh oh.

2388
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,160
Uh oh.

2389
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:36,420
Uh oh.

2390
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:37,220
Wait, uh oh.

2391
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:41,520
Uh oh.

2392
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,900
Well, the scruffies have to go this way.

2393
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:50,880
Because if they go this way, they will immediately go in.

2394
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,420
So they have to go the other way.

2395
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:56,380
But uh oh.

2396
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:57,820
We have a lot of single men.

2397
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:13,190
I think it'll work out.

2398
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:13,670
Oh!

2399
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:15,150
We do have another ponytail!

2400
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:16,510
We do have another ponytail.

2401
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:17,130
Okay.

2402
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:20,370
I missed you, Apu.

2403
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,830
I think I've missed you several times.

2404
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:22,830
My bad.

2405
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,710
Thanks for the... No!

2406
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:32,370
Happy to see you streaming again.

2407
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:33,130
Thank you so much!

2408
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:35,570
Okay.

2409
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:36,970
Ibleble.

2410
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:39,350
Go Ibleble.

2411
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:44,470
Okay.

2412
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:44,990
Okay.

2413
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:45,850
We're fine.

2414
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:46,870
We're fine, everybody.

2415
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:49,170
We're fine.

2416
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:49,830
We're fine.

2417
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:50,170
We're fine.

2418
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:54,290
I'm single by choice.

2419
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:56,810
Yeah.

2420
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:07,290
You...

2421
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:08,610
Last,

2422
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:28,620
but not least.

2423
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:29,980
Soul Proof.

2424
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:37,760
I'm single by choice.

2425
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,980
Not mine.

2426
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:39,820
Oh!

2427
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,520
Don't worry about it.

2428
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:45,940
Being single is fine, you know?

2429
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,340
It's fine, too.

2430
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:49,860
Right?

2431
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,320
I did.

2432
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:55,340
Good for me!

2433
01:45:58,740 --> 01:45:59,760
Thanks, narrator.

2434
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,260
Prosperity.

2435
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:23,140
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I deprived you of that magnificent performance originally.

2436
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,360
I'm so sorry.

2437
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:30,460
Oh, we got a school!

2438
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,920
And little houses!

2439
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:34,600
A schoolhouse.

2440
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:41,160
So it's the Zimbanis who flushed the finicky fleens in Hotel Dementia?

2441
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:46,880
Had pleasant dreams and catapulted cleanly over Mudball Wall.

2442
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,080
What else?

2443
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:54,680
What's this one?

2444
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,880
This bowling alley honors...

2445
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:08,780
I love how we just escaped, like, this terrible situation that the Zimbanis are in.

2446
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:13,300
And their first thought is just like, Yeah, we need a bowling alley.

2447
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,340
Like...

2448
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,740
Maybe a supermarket.

2449
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,400
Like, you guys gotta eat.

2450
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,520
Nah, bowling alley.

2451
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:32,900
Did not lag in Lion's Lair, solved the secrets of the mirror machine, and flew above Bubble Wonder Abyss.

2452
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:35,780
Thank you for the raid!

2453
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,680
Thank you so much!

2454
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:37,900
Thank you!

2455
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,380
Really appreciate it.

2456
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,820
Hope you had a good stream.

2457
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:45,420
Thank you!

2458
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,160
We're playing Zimbanis.

2459
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:55,240
So the Zimbanis finally reached their new home.

2460
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:57,220
They established a nation of Zimbanis.

2461
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:58,140
Four Zimbanis.

2462
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,600
This independent nation would later be known to...

2463
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:01,460
Very nice, isn't it?

2464
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,840
But don't you have a job to do?

2465
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:07,440
Zimbanis to free?

2466
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,100
Did he just say, this is good, isn't it?

2467
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,260
You can't just say that in front of me.

2468
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:17,740
Alright, guys.

2469
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:21,180
How do I change the difficulty?

2470
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,540
How do I make it more difficult?

2471
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:26,340
Options?

2472
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,540
No...

2473
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:30,760
Oh, we have on-screen captions?

2474
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,400
Should have done that before.

2475
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,060
Hmm...

2476
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,100
Do I have to do it on practice?

2477
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:44,660
Very, very hard.

2478
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,420
Oh my god.

2479
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:50,580
I'm scared.

2480
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:56,060
I don't think I've ever done it this hard before.

2481
01:48:59,320 --> 01:48:59,920
Okay.

2482
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:01,840
Now we're doing difficult mode.

2483
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:04,400
We don't know a single...

2484
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:07,820
We can't, we can't, we can't cater to our...

2485
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:08,720
Actually, hold on.

2486
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:10,140
I'll make my favorite though.

2487
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:13,340
There we go.

2488
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,780
Okay, the rest are all random.

2489
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:17,580
There they...

2490
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:19,260
Why do they all look the same?

2491
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:20,300
Okay, stop it.

2492
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:29,000
Can't remember a single day in Hotel Dementia for some reason.

2493
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:33,360
Go for it.

2494
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,220
I believe in you, Mint.

2495
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:34,900
Okay.

2496
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:36,320
Let's go.

2497
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:37,780
I didn't change it.

2498
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:38,080
Wait.

2499
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,840
What do you mean I didn't change it?

2500
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,560
See, it's on very hard.

2501
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,140
Oh, but here...

2502
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,700
See, it won't let me change it.

2503
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:50,800
I'm clicking, I'm clicking, but it won't let me change it.

2504
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,680
Sorry, sorry.

2505
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,780
I didn't mean to abandon you guys.

2506
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,120
Okay.

2507
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:56,900
How am I supposed to change it?

2508
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:04,670
Oh, they level up the more you do it.

2509
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:10,790
So, this is just me practicing the each one.

2510
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:11,270
Okay.

2511
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:12,010
I get it.

2512
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,470
I get it.

2513
01:50:13,110 --> 01:50:16,810
I have to grind to get the very, very hard.

2514
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:20,530
I'm so curious though.

2515
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:22,870
How is it so hard on the pizza one?

2516
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:23,870
Okay, let's just do the...

2517
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:31,630
Pizza for lunch and snack and dinner and dessert, baby, would satisfy me.

2518
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:42,710
Pizza time.

2519
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:43,890
Pizza time.

2520
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:46,820
Okay.

2521
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:49,860
Satisfy me.

2522
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:50,180
Okay.

2523
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,480
So, let's look at what's NG.

2524
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:56,040
There has... there is no ice cream.

2525
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:56,940
Okay.

2526
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,380
Ice cream by itself is NG.

2527
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,960
So, it's got to be chocolate ice cream.

2528
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,360
It's got to be chocolate ice cream.

2529
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:09,920
Cheese.

2530
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,460
Doesn't like mushrooms.

2531
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:16,860
Here, let's just try a bell pepper.

2532
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,680
Make me a pizza.

2533
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,520
Something Moscow.

2534
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:26,740
Oh, okay.

2535
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:29,300
That topping, not for meatbags.

2536
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:30,000
Not for meatbags.

2537
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:30,880
Uh-oh.

2538
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:37,460
Okay.

2539
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,820
Maybe it's not even the cheese.

2540
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:48,040
They don't all like the same thing.

2541
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:51,900
There's stuff on that I don't like.

2542
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:52,480
Okay.

2543
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:53,120
I'm sorry.

2544
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:54,780
That topping, no.

2545
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:56,560
Uh-oh.

2546
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:57,860
Uh-oh.

2547
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,440
I feel so much pressure right now.

2548
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,500
Okay.

2549
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:05,740
So, maybe it... Okay.

2550
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:11,890
Just the pineapple?

2551
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:18,630
Don't kick him out.

2552
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,510
More!

2553
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,130
More!

2554
01:52:20,930 --> 01:52:23,090
That topping, not for meatbags.

2555
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:24,650
Uh-oh.

2556
01:52:24,930 --> 01:52:25,410
Okay.

2557
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:27,450
So, it's probably...

2558
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:28,070
Okay.

2559
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:29,510
So, she doesn't like pineapple at all.

2560
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:30,350
Wait.

2561
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:30,890
So, maybe...

2562
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:35,070
Can I do like a pineapple like sausage?

2563
01:52:37,730 --> 01:52:38,530
Oh, no!

2564
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:39,530
I forgot the chocolate!

2565
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:40,270
Oh, no.

2566
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:41,310
I'm sorry.

2567
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:41,930
I'm sorry.

2568
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,350
I'm sorry.

2569
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:44,950
There's stuff on that I don't like.

2570
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:48,450
Why do you not like the vanilla ice cream by itself but you're fine with it with chocolate?

2571
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:52,270
Something's wrong.

2572
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:54,270
Something's wrong.

2573
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:58,410
Okay.

2574
01:52:58,590 --> 01:52:58,930
Okay.

2575
01:52:58,990 --> 01:52:59,270
Okay.

2576
01:52:59,270 --> 01:52:59,450
Okay.

2577
01:53:00,430 --> 01:53:01,730
He didn't like the peppers.

2578
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:02,750
No.

2579
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:03,910
I don't think he liked the cheese.

2580
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:06,190
Something must go.

2581
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:09,990
There's something there I won't eat.

2582
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:10,250
What?

2583
01:53:11,770 --> 01:53:12,630
Uh-oh.

2584
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:15,310
There's something on that I don't want.

2585
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:22,190
The guy... The guy on the right looks like he would like put his fingers together and be like, Ooh.

2586
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:23,390
Sorry.

2587
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:23,870
Ooh.

2588
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:31,860
Maybe it's sausage.

2589
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,100
Just peppers, I think?

2590
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:41,710
No, but he liked the pineapple.

2591
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:45,250
He didn't like just the peppers, right?

2592
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:46,030
We tried that.

2593
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:52,110
No pineapple, but he... This guy likes the pineapple.

2594
01:53:56,190 --> 01:53:57,370
She doesn't like pineapple.

2595
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:58,730
I think.

2596
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,600
Some of those toppings are distasteful.

2597
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:06,740
Don't punch him.

2598
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,980
Gee, I wasn't expecting that one.

2599
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:10,440
Gee.

2600
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,220
Don't punch him.

2601
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:12,060
Okay.

2602
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,340
More toppings.

2603
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:17,320
Okay.

2604
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:22,920
Okay.

2605
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:27,360
Okay.

2606
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:28,980
That topping?

2607
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:29,740
No.

2608
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:33,040
Something on that's not good for me.

2609
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:33,600
Don't punch him.

2610
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,360
Okay.

2611
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:36,440
Okay.

2612
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:42,740
They're so mean.

2613
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:43,860
Okay.

2614
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,100
This.

2615
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:46,700
This is his combo.

2616
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,020
Right?

2617
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:50,020
This is his combo.

2618
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:50,640
Has to be.

2619
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:51,700
He said more toppings.

2620
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:57,580
Please.

2621
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,100
Something on that I don't like.

2622
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,160
I don't get it.

2623
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:04,780
What do you mean I don't like it?

2624
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:05,600
That topping...

2625
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:09,200
You wanted more!

2626
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,900
He hates the cheese.

2627
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:13,300
Uh-oh.

2628
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,040
I think we're...

2629
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:14,620
Wait,

2630
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,880
can the dessert be...

2631
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:23,600
Oh, it can be combined too!

2632
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:28,280
Okay, so I think he likes the pizza.

2633
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:29,080
As is.

2634
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:34,760
Maybe he wants this.

2635
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:37,460
Because this is bad.

2636
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:38,760
Right?

2637
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:45,640
What?

2638
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,400
Oh my god, he's gonna get punched.

2639
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,800
It's kind of funny to watch him.

2640
01:55:59,380 --> 01:55:59,900
Oh,

2641
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:10,600
it's so good.

2642
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:16,160
Is this it?

2643
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:25,050
Okay, we got one.

2644
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:29,310
This guy is so ridiculous.

2645
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:30,750
Yay!

2646
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:33,650
Oh my gosh.

2647
01:56:34,510 --> 01:56:38,150
Okay, so we know she doesn't like a pizza...

2648
01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:38,870
Not pizza.

2649
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:40,130
She doesn't like the pineapple.

2650
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:45,450
This thing is gonna be so full by the end.

2651
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:49,950
Oh my gosh, it's tricky with having so many different types of toppings.

2652
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:53,350
Well, they weren't kidding when they said very, very hard.

2653
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:55,450
It is so hard.

2654
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:57,290
Mm-hmm.

2655
01:56:58,610 --> 01:56:59,210
So...

2656
01:56:59,950 --> 01:57:00,730
Let's see.

2657
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:06,110
I don't remember which ones are my creations and which one are...

2658
01:57:07,890 --> 01:57:08,930
I don't know.

2659
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:12,890
The graveyard of lost pizzas.

2660
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:13,490
I know.

2661
01:57:14,690 --> 01:57:15,290
Hmm.

2662
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:18,510
Just plain everything.

2663
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:20,410
I know, right?

2664
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,350
What do you like?

2665
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:38,690
Just...

2666
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:42,790
I'm just gonna try it because I don't know what her opinion is on the peppers.

2667
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:46,970
Some of those toppings are distasteful.

2668
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:47,950
Distasteful.

2669
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:50,330
It's still missing my favorites.

2670
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:53,130
Okay, so he likes the peppers.

2671
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:56,410
Oh!

2672
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:00,300
Okay.

2673
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,780
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2674
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:01,880
Okay.

2675
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:03,460
What didn't he like?

2676
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,300
Oh gosh, I was only paying attention to him.

2677
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:14,370
Maybe this.

2678
01:58:17,050 --> 01:58:17,990
You like that?

2679
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:21,450
This isn't about you!

2680
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,100
We're going through them pretty quickly now.

2681
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:38,700
Oh gosh!

2682
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:40,380
Okay, so...

2683
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:47,890
I can't remember what his opinion was on this one.

2684
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:52,620
I don't know.

2685
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:53,700
Do any of them like cheese?

2686
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:56,600
Let's try this.

2687
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,700
Do you like cheese, mister?

2688
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:00,720
Do you like cheese?

2689
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:03,540
Ah!

2690
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:04,920
I don't care!

2691
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:07,860
Oh!

2692
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:08,320
Oh!

2693
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:08,520
Oh!

2694
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:08,800
Oh!

2695
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:10,560
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2696
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:16,900
Thank God this is just practice.

2697
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:22,860
They're getting massacred.

2698
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,660
This is so sad.

2699
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:29,260
Do you want a little topping?

2700
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:30,060
Do you want that?

2701
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:31,920
This is making me want pizza.

2702
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:35,000
Something's wrong.

2703
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:37,660
Something's wrong.

2704
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:38,600
What the?

2705
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:40,640
Something's wrong.

2706
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,300
The way he says it kind of annoys me.

2707
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:47,880
What do you guys think?

2708
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,060
What do you guys think?

2709
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:49,900
What would you...

2710
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:50,220
What do you...

2711
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:51,820
What are your ideas?

2712
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:57,660
Sounds like he's mocking her.

2713
01:59:57,820 --> 01:59:58,480
I know, right?

2714
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,000
Something's wrong, Sprinkles.

2715
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:07,180
Sprinkles.

2716
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:08,680
Sprinkles.

2717
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:11,500
I don't know.

2718
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,160
I think I just gave him that one, right?

2719
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,680
That topping?

2720
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:16,480
No.

2721
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:18,200
Uh-oh.

2722
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:19,300
Uh-oh.

2723
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,280
Someone says mushroom is missing.

2724
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:23,260
Does he like mushroom?

2725
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:27,660
Let's just try it.

2726
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:32,780
Something's wrong.

2727
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:34,700
For me?

2728
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:35,200
Oh!

2729
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:35,980
Nice!

2730
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:36,600
Oh!

2731
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:37,160
Oh!

2732
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:38,100
Oh my gosh!

2733
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:38,840
You were so right!

2734
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:41,440
Good job.

2735
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,080
Good job.

2736
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:42,700
Good job.

2737
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:43,280
Good job.

2738
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:43,700
Good job.

2739
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:44,480
Okay.

2740
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:46,780
She hates everything.

2741
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:49,780
I honestly have no idea what she wants.

2742
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:53,280
Like, do you want just a plain pizza?

2743
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:55,980
I don't understand what she wants.

2744
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:01,780
An empty.

2745
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:02,760
Give her a whole plain.

2746
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:03,460
All right.

2747
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:04,340
This one's for you.

2748
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:06,780
So carefully.

2749
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:07,140
Oh!

2750
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:07,540
She's so crafty.

2751
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:08,500
Is that all I get?

2752
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:09,040
Yes!

2753
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:10,660
Because you don't like anything else!

2754
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:20,060
So she hates pineapple.

2755
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:21,400
She hates peppers.

2756
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:26,180
Maybe just cheese.

2757
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,220
Just cheese.

2758
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:29,720
Let's try just cheese.

2759
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:35,360
There's something there I hate.

2760
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:36,260
Oh my god!

2761
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,040
It's a pizza!

2762
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:37,120
It's a pizza!

2763
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:39,140
It's just a pizza!

2764
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:45,180
My god!

2765
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:46,880
She hates cheese!

2766
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,140
This is ridiculous.

2767
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:55,060
I don't even know.

2768
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:55,980
Just this?

2769
02:01:58,840 --> 02:01:59,840
Just give her the...

2770
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:00,060
Yeah.

2771
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:01,440
Is this all you want?

2772
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:01,940
You want your...

2773
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:03,600
No way!

2774
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:06,920
What!

2775
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,120
No way!

2776
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:16,430
My friends, I'm sorry.

2777
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:18,030
My friends would make their way back to safety.

2778
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:19,190
She just got like a soup.

2779
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:21,410
The intrepid ban continues.

2780
02:02:23,610 --> 02:02:24,530
Bravely onward.

2781
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:25,450
Oh my gosh.

2782
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:26,450
We made it through though.

2783
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:27,950
I...

2784
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:28,830
I...

2785
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:29,850
I...

2786
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:30,070
What?

2787
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:34,170
Psychopath behavior right there.

2788
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:36,290
Wow.

2789
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:39,170
Wow.

2790
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:40,470
That one was really tricky though.

2791
02:02:40,630 --> 02:02:41,250
It was fun.

2792
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:43,250
Let's try something else.

2793
02:02:43,290 --> 02:02:43,950
Let's try another one.

2794
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:45,110
Let's try the frogs.

2795
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:46,330
Frogs.

2796
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:46,430
Frogs.

2797
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:51,000
I do remember the fairy.

2798
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,240
I do remember.

2799
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:54,640
But I don't re...

2800
02:02:55,620 --> 02:02:56,600
What's that thing?

2801
02:02:57,340 --> 02:02:57,600
I...

2802
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,040
Oh.

2803
02:02:58,140 --> 02:02:58,880
What is that thing?

2804
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:00,780
What are you doing?

2805
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,500
What is that thing?

2806
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:02,940
Oh.

2807
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:03,920
Oh.

2808
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:05,420
I think I need to hurry.

2809
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:05,920
Wait.

2810
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,760
What is that thing?

2811
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:08,600
What is that thing?

2812
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:09,520
Ah!

2813
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:11,060
What's it doing?

2814
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:18,590
Oh no.

2815
02:03:19,450 --> 02:03:20,610
I think it found the key.

2816
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:22,850
We found the path and now it's taking over it.

2817
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:26,570
Oh my gosh!

2818
02:03:28,330 --> 02:03:29,090
Oh, but they leave.

2819
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:32,010
I don't know what the magic wand does.

2820
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:35,970
The pink unfortunately does not work.

2821
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:39,430
Blue... does not work.

2822
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:44,490
Red... does not work.

2823
02:03:47,070 --> 02:03:48,850
Yellow... does not work.

2824
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:50,870
These things are so annoying!

2825
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:53,910
Try it out.

2826
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:59,350
Oh wait, maybe it will...

2827
02:03:59,910 --> 02:04:01,310
What was one that was close?

2828
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:01,870
This one?

2829
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:10,700
Oh my

2830
02:04:16,770 --> 02:04:18,170
god, hurry!

2831
02:04:18,430 --> 02:04:18,870
Hurry!

2832
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:22,860
Oh, we're fine.

2833
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,320
Go!

2834
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:26,800
Go!

2835
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:27,440
Go!

2836
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:31,580
This game is so...

2837
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:33,360
It's so souls-like.

2838
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:36,020
No!

2839
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:37,560
Oh my gosh.

2840
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:38,300
No, please.

2841
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:40,920
It's over.

2842
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:41,860
No!

2843
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:42,320
No!

2844
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:42,760
No!

2845
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:44,440
Oh no!

2846
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:45,940
No!

2847
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:46,460
Oh!

2848
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:46,760
Oh!

2849
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,080
He's following us!

2850
02:04:49,220 --> 02:04:49,780
Ew, he's creepy!

2851
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:50,100
Creepy!

2852
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:50,320
Creepy!

2853
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:50,640
Creepy!

2854
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,960
Uh-oh.

2855
02:04:54,980 --> 02:04:55,500
Uh-oh.

2856
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:57,380
Wait, what's going to happen with them?

2857
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:00,520
No!

2858
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:04,760
Okay, no...

2859
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:05,100
Oh!

2860
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:05,460
Oh!

2861
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:06,280
Oh my gosh!

2862
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:11,290
It worked!

2863
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:15,190
It ended up working out!

2864
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:17,810
We got so lucky.

2865
02:05:18,730 --> 02:05:21,170
Wait, so with the magic wand, can I like...

2866
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:25,530
Like, say if I want to move this one and this one.

2867
02:05:25,730 --> 02:05:26,290
Oh, I can!

2868
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:29,190
Interesting.

2869
02:05:29,690 --> 02:05:30,650
There's a little...

2870
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:31,350
I think...

2871
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:33,730
I see like the magic running out.

2872
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:41,830
Why does that Zumbini look weird?

2873
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:44,710
I guess they all kind of look weird.

2874
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:46,270
Uh-oh.

2875
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:46,570
Oh!

2876
02:05:46,610 --> 02:05:47,690
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2877
02:05:47,790 --> 02:05:48,470
Nice, nice, nice.

2878
02:05:50,730 --> 02:05:52,410
Why does he Fortnite dance?

2879
02:05:53,330 --> 02:05:54,510
Because he's excited.

2880
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:57,570
Let him do his thing.

2881
02:05:57,570 --> 02:05:57,790
Bing!

2882
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:00,050
Don't judge!

2883
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:01,490
Don't judge!

2884
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:07,200
Oh.

2885
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,220
I can also make the yellows work.

2886
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:13,540
Bing!

2887
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:13,860
Bing!

2888
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:15,180
Bing!

2889
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,120
Bing!

2890
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:18,020
Yellow.

2891
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,440
What exactly is the puzzle here?

2892
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:24,000
Okay.

2893
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:28,680
So there's multiple types of paths that you can do.

2894
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:30,440
Depending on what the frog is, right?

2895
02:06:30,580 --> 02:06:36,100
So the first one is by color.

2896
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:40,680
The second is by the shape of the lily pad.

2897
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:41,080
See?

2898
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:41,600
Four.

2899
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:41,960
Four.

2900
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:44,060
Moon.

2901
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:45,080
Moon.

2902
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:45,680
Moon.

2903
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:46,040
Moon.

2904
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,560
I gotta get moon.

2905
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:51,400
Moon.

2906
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:51,800
Moon.

2907
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:58,000
And the third is the type of the flower that's on the lily pad.

2908
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:02,180
Moon, moon.

2909
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,820
There's just so much info on the screen right now.

2910
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:09,040
I think that's why I like this one so much.

2911
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:12,560
There's so much that you can, like, look at.

2912
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:14,300
I hate these things.

2913
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,340
I've never seen these before.

2914
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:20,960
Clearly, I suck at the game as a child because I never got this far.

2915
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:24,040
Uh-oh.

2916
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:25,040
Uh-oh.

2917
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:26,460
Uh-oh.

2918
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:27,560
Uh-oh.

2919
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:27,980
Uh-oh.

2920
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:28,280
Agh!

2921
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:32,980
No.

2922
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,200
No.

2923
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:34,460
Oh, no.

2924
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:35,420
Oh no.

2925
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:37,160
Oh no.

2926
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:38,260
Oh no.

2927
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:39,840
Oh no.

2928
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:40,560
Oh no no no.

2929
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:41,840
Oh no.

2930
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:44,000
Oh no no no.

2931
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:44,840
Oh no no no no no.

2932
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:45,960
Oh no.

2933
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:46,320
Oh no.

2934
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:48,960
A traffic jam!

2935
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,160
These ones like- these guys are blocked up too!

2936
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:57,400
They're blocking the blue path that I just made.

2937
02:07:57,700 --> 02:07:57,960
Plus, it's really peaceful.

2938
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:01,680
Uh-oh.

2939
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:02,180
Guys?

2940
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:17,640
Do I even have enough magic to finish the path for them?

2941
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,320
They get clogged here.

2942
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:27,760
Oh, it stops it.

2943
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,260
Let's just do...

2944
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:35,340
this one.

2945
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:37,740
Goodbye!

2946
02:08:39,740 --> 02:08:40,260
Sayonara!

2947
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:43,640
There they go!

2948
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:45,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2949
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:47,560
There we go.

2950
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,700
There we go.

2951
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:50,300
Wait, why are you going back?

2952
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:51,680
Okay, yeah?

2953
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:52,640
Move.

2954
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,580
Oh my god.

2955
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,260
You're supposed to go forward!

2956
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:57,500
You're supposed to go forward!

2957
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:03,200
Oh my god.

2958
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:05,880
It's too slow.

2959
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,160
No!

2960
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:09,780
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

2961
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:10,680
Oh my gosh.

2962
02:09:10,860 --> 02:09:11,400
You!

2963
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:11,980
You!

2964
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,760
They're all coming back.

2965
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:16,860
They're all coming...

2966
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:18,040
They're all coming back.

2967
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:19,520
Oh my gosh.

2968
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:21,260
No!

2969
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:23,460
No, please!

2970
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:24,620
No!

2971
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:34,350
Please just leave.

2972
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:35,770
Oh my gosh.

2973
02:09:35,790 --> 02:09:37,110
I don't think he's going to leave in time.

2974
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:38,070
They're too slow!

2975
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:39,050
They're too slow!

2976
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:41,390
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

2977
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:42,310
Wait!

2978
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:44,070
Please leave.

2979
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:45,730
Oh my god.

2980
02:09:46,070 --> 02:09:46,890
Existence is pain.

2981
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:48,330
Oh my gosh.

2982
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,730
Please!

2983
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:49,670
Hot frog!

2984
02:09:49,730 --> 02:09:49,990
Hot frog!

2985
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:51,170
We made it!

2986
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:51,630
We made it!

2987
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:52,010
Oh my gosh.

2988
02:09:52,010 --> 02:09:52,450
We made it!

2989
02:09:52,470 --> 02:09:53,210
We made it!

2990
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:53,690
We made it!

2991
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:54,190
We made it!

2992
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:54,550
We made it!

2993
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:54,650
We made it!

2994
02:09:55,950 --> 02:09:56,350
Oh...

2995
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,750
Sweet.

2996
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:58,850
Release.

2997
02:10:00,330 --> 02:10:00,730
Oh...

2998
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:02,490
Oh my gosh.

2999
02:10:02,490 --> 02:10:02,730
Oh my gosh.

3000
02:10:10,330 --> 02:10:12,430
Hip, hip, zumbini!

3001
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:16,730
I don't even...

3002
02:10:16,730 --> 02:10:18,510
What other path can I take?

3003
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:22,810
Which seat can I take?

3004
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:25,030
I think I screwed everything up.

3005
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:27,190
By using the magic wand too much.

3006
02:10:27,630 --> 02:10:29,650
I played God and I'm...

3007
02:10:30,230 --> 02:10:32,050
I played God and I...

3008
02:10:32,490 --> 02:10:33,390
I'm regretting it.

3009
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:36,530
I shouldn't have done it.

3010
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,350
Oh my gosh.

3011
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:40,710
Aqua blue?

3012
02:10:40,930 --> 02:10:41,630
Oh, you're right.

3013
02:10:47,070 --> 02:10:48,310
Did I make that one?

3014
02:10:48,490 --> 02:10:48,910
Or...

3015
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:54,910
Being God is suffering.

3016
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:01,470
I wonder how many crabs are here.

3017
02:11:03,030 --> 02:11:06,870
I wonder how many crabs we can accumulate before we crash the game.

3018
02:11:08,990 --> 02:11:11,510
Do they just end up despawning or...

3019
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:15,550
How many crabs can we grab?

3020
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:19,290
Hmm...

3021
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:27,210
I want to take that path.

3022
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:29,310
But I can't.

3023
02:11:29,310 --> 02:11:29,870
Oh my gosh.

3024
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:30,770
They just keep coming.

3025
02:11:32,910 --> 02:11:35,670
You can tell there's new ones because they're...

3026
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:37,590
These guys just given up.

3027
02:11:37,630 --> 02:11:38,330
They don't even move.

3028
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:39,810
They don't care anymore.

3029
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:47,020
There's only one way to know.

3030
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:52,120
What else can we...

3031
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:53,460
What else do we have here?

3032
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:57,740
Uh... X?

3033
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:00,020
Oh, flower?

3034
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:00,260
Flower?

3035
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,680
The flower could maybe work.

3036
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,240
I gotta use my...

3037
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:08,200
I gotta play God again.

3038
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:18,830
Wait,

3039
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:25,620
where did it start?

3040
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:28,040
Where did I start the flower at?

3041
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,380
Did I just mess up?

3042
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:30,420
Am I an idiot?

3043
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,600
I think I'm dumb, you guys.

3044
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:33,460
I think I'm stupid.

3045
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:33,600
I think I'm stupid.

3046
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,000
We regained.

3047
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:43,620
We regained.

3048
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:44,140
We regained.

3049
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:44,480
We...

3050
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:47,400
It's fine.

3051
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:48,580
And flower.

3052
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:00,000
Is this modded?

3053
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:02,720
Modded Zoombinis.

3054
02:13:03,700 --> 02:13:06,840
Only for the hardcore Zoombinis fans.

3055
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:11,000
Yeah.

3056
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:13,080
You know.

3057
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:17,220
Wait, what is that guy doing?

3058
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:19,500
What are you doing?

3059
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:23,800
Oh my gosh, I think there's...

3060
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:24,440
I think they've...

3061
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:25,220
I think they've...

3062
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:26,180
Oh, nope, never mind.

3063
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:26,740
They're still coming.

3064
02:13:32,420 --> 02:13:34,020
Mod Zoombinis into wisps?

3065
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:35,400
Oh my gosh, that'd be crazy.

3066
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:36,920
What one was it?

3067
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:37,200
The flower?

3068
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:41,260
There we go.

3069
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:41,540
Here we go.

3070
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:41,760
Oh no.

3071
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,400
Wait, there might be a clash.

3072
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:44,900
Oh, okay.

3073
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:45,860
It's fine.

3074
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:47,420
He'll make it back.

3075
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:53,500
I think...

3076
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:56,280
I don't think I like this mini-game anymore.

3077
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:02,580
Okay, let's go to another one, because this one...

3078
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:05,680
The crabs are too much for me.

3079
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:08,640
No, don't do it.

3080
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:10,100
That's what I thought.

3081
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:11,220
Back off.

3082
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:12,260
Back off.

3083
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:15,060
Silence.

3084
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:17,360
Finally.

3085
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,880
No more brain-scritching sounds.

3086
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:25,460
I'm just so curious what some of these other puzzles would be like super hard.

3087
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,240
You know what I mean?

3088
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:27,960
Like, what's this one?

3089
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:31,200
Well,

3090
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:36,060
what do we have here?

3091
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:42,320
Okay, so, wait, so... I don't really care.

3092
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:46,360
So, like, they would have to have something...

3093
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:48,660
And then they would...

3094
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:53,900
Oh my... I don't think it's cross.

3095
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:54,960
I don't think it's cross.

3096
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:55,520
Luckily.

3097
02:14:57,320 --> 02:14:58,520
But like that... oh wait!

3098
02:14:58,620 --> 02:14:59,800
No, she doesn't have a red nose.

3099
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:00,820
Oh my gosh.

3100
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:02,720
Wait, this one works though.

3101
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:04,000
This one works.

3102
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:08,820
Does this one... does this one go for the... wait.

3103
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:15,730
I guess just this.

3104
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:21,850
I'm going by nose color currently.

3105
02:15:22,110 --> 02:15:23,770
I wasn't in the beginning, but now I am.

3106
02:15:25,950 --> 02:15:26,310
Nose.

3107
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:27,390
Nose.

3108
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:34,180
Nose.

3109
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:36,280
That's our only pink.

3110
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:40,180
There you go, you got it.

3111
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:41,280
There you go, you got it.

3112
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:42,540
What nose?

3113
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:43,420
What are you talking about?

3114
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:44,520
They all have noses.

3115
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,540
Don't give me your sass.

3116
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:52,000
Don't give me your sass.

3117
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:54,480
Nose!

3118
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:00,020
Oh, okay.

3119
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:01,380
I was going to say, is he gone?

3120
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:07,780
Hey Mint, out of curiosity, did you ever play a game called Virtual Villagers?

3121
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:11,300
I remember playing this game and Virtual Villagers a lot as a kid.

3122
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:13,340
I never played a Virtual Villagers.

3123
02:16:13,460 --> 02:16:13,700
No.

3124
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,840
I had not played that.

3125
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:18,080
Sure!

3126
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:21,940
I think I screwed up with her.

3127
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:29,830
See, but this one won't work.

3128
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:30,970
Crab's alive!

3129
02:16:31,610 --> 02:16:32,210
Crab's alive?

3130
02:16:32,830 --> 02:16:34,010
What does that mean?

3131
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:36,570
Crab's alive!

3132
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:39,270
Oh my gosh, this one's hard.

3133
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:50,120
Crab's alive!

3134
02:17:00,050 --> 02:17:01,470
This one's hard.

3135
02:17:05,290 --> 02:17:07,290
Don't like how the fish looks?

3136
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:09,610
Oh, I just noticed them.

3137
02:17:10,450 --> 02:17:10,750
Eww.

3138
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:17,270
Hmm.

3139
02:17:18,050 --> 02:17:18,950
Hmm.

3140
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:20,830
Hmm.

3141
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:22,210
Hmm.

3142
02:17:23,190 --> 02:17:24,090
Hmm.

3143
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:26,250
Hmm.

3144
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:28,410
Hmm.

3145
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:28,710
Hmm.

3146
02:17:28,710 --> 02:17:28,990
Hmm.

3147
02:17:28,990 --> 02:17:29,730
Hmm.

3148
02:17:29,730 --> 02:17:29,950
Hmm.

3149
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:30,670
Minecraft villager.

3150
02:17:30,670 --> 02:17:30,990
Hmm.

3151
02:17:31,490 --> 02:17:32,650
Crab died.

3152
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:35,730
Hmm.

3153
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:37,930
Hmm.

3154
02:17:39,030 --> 02:17:39,690
Hmm.

3155
02:17:40,810 --> 02:17:41,470
Hmm.

3156
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:50,550
Trying to figure out what would be the easiest thing to focus on, you know?

3157
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:53,670
Okay, redo, redo, redo, redo.

3158
02:17:54,550 --> 02:17:55,870
Redo, redo, redo.

3159
02:17:57,470 --> 02:17:58,450
He's floating.

3160
02:17:58,450 --> 02:17:58,630
He's floating.

3161
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:04,290
These poor guys don't even have names.

3162
02:18:04,390 --> 02:18:04,930
That's so sad.

3163
02:18:06,330 --> 02:18:07,730
Practice Zumbini one.

3164
02:18:08,330 --> 02:18:09,570
Okay, practice Zumbini.

3165
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:11,990
Fine, sit wherever you want to.

3166
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:12,750
I don't really care.

3167
02:18:12,750 --> 02:18:13,170
I don't really care.

3168
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:15,250
Starting from the center.

3169
02:18:15,550 --> 02:18:15,710
Hmm.

3170
02:18:17,090 --> 02:18:18,150
So if I'm like...

3171
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:20,110
Okay, let's just place these guys kind of randomly.

3172
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:20,470
Oh.

3173
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:21,070
Oh.

3174
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:22,350
She worked, but...

3175
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:23,190
You.

3176
02:18:24,050 --> 02:18:24,570
Sure!

3177
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:25,830
And you.

3178
02:18:26,910 --> 02:18:27,850
Are four.

3179
02:18:28,070 --> 02:18:29,870
And they each have different eyes!

3180
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:31,710
Wait, this kind of works.

3181
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:32,790
This kind of works, maybe.

3182
02:18:33,710 --> 02:18:34,110
Maybe.

3183
02:18:38,940 --> 02:18:39,340
Okay.

3184
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:47,310
Is this...

3185
02:18:48,450 --> 02:18:48,850
No.

3186
02:18:49,130 --> 02:18:49,530
Wait.

3187
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:50,270
Wait.

3188
02:18:50,390 --> 02:18:50,870
No, does...

3189
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:52,170
Which one does this go with?

3190
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:56,160
How...

3191
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,420
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

3192
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:01,400
I see, I see, I see, I see.

3193
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:02,840
Ah, sure.

3194
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:03,560
Yeah.

3195
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:05,720
Um...

3196
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:06,540
Hmm.

3197
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:12,810
The nose color always throws me off.

3198
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:14,690
Because it's like the last thing I look at.

3199
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:17,030
Um...

3200
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:19,430
Red nose...

3201
02:19:19,430 --> 02:19:21,210
Rudolph...

3202
02:19:21,210 --> 02:19:23,790
The red nose reindeer.

3203
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:28,210
You have nothing in common.

3204
02:19:29,930 --> 02:19:30,650
Hmm.

3205
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,620
Oh, no.

3206
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:38,960
No!

3207
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:40,660
I

3208
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:57,900
should have delayed it.

3209
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:58,240
Thank you!

3210
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:58,240
Phew!

3211
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:00,500
Praise the sun.

3212
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:08,860
These animations are nuts, I know.

3213
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:18,560
The one thing that really is so impressive to me, looking at stuff like Freddy Fish, is just how much the game is all animated.

3214
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:19,840
I'm going to be out here.

3215
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:21,700
Hey, calm down mister.

3216
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:23,740
I'm thinking, okay?

3217
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:28,520
My brain runs a little more slowly.

3218
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:31,800
I wonder instead in the center, maybe I should do the nose colors.

3219
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:33,720
Because I feel like that might be the...

3220
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:35,660
Where'd he go?

3221
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:36,580
Uh oh.

3222
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:38,740
Like if it's...

3223
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:41,800
Wait.

3224
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:44,840
Like red?

3225
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:48,060
No, but they have nothing in common.

3226
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:52,660
They have nothing in common.

3227
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:54,140
Oh.

3228
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:55,300
Oh.

3229
02:20:55,860 --> 02:20:56,960
I was like, oh no.

3230
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,200
I think I just sacrificed her.

3231
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:00,480
Phew.

3232
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,580
To the crabs you go.

3233
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:05,400
Crabs alive!

3234
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:09,180
The crabs are alive with the taste of blood.

3235
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:20,360
I never understood what this wanted us to do.

3236
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:21,620
You have to...

3237
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:25,480
So, the person next to them has to have one matching feature.

3238
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:25,900
Sorry.

3239
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:26,720
Zumbini.

3240
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,100
Next to them has to have one matching feature.

3241
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:38,700
So, in this case, it would be like either the hair or the nose color or the feet or the eyes.

3242
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,700
Well, that's the only thing that can match.

3243
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:41,420
All aboard.

3244
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:43,200
I'm getting board.

3245
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:43,960
Shut up.

3246
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:47,040
What?

3247
02:21:47,740 --> 02:21:49,240
Back on shore then, Bubba.

3248
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:50,260
Wait.

3249
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:50,540
No.

3250
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:51,060
I'm so confused.

3251
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:53,500
They have the same feet.

3252
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:54,620
What?

3253
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:54,700
What?

3254
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:59,820
But they have the same feet.

3255
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:08,900
Diagonal counts?

3256
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:10,980
No.

3257
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:11,240
Wait.

3258
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:11,480
Wait.

3259
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:11,740
Okay.

3260
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:12,020
Hold on.

3261
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:12,620
I'm going to test this.

3262
02:22:14,100 --> 02:22:15,260
It does count.

3263
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:20,060
No way.

3264
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:22,940
Diagonal does count.

3265
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:25,620
That's so evil.

3266
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:26,620
What?

3267
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:29,180
What?

3268
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:35,880
I think the board is f'ed.

3269
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:38,820
It's supposed to be a 4x4 board, but it's all stacked.

3270
02:22:38,980 --> 02:22:40,560
That's what's confusing me about it.

3271
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:41,580
So, that's why I was just like...

3272
02:22:41,580 --> 02:22:41,720
Okay.

3273
02:22:41,780 --> 02:22:43,380
I was counting them because I was just like...

3274
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:43,720
Okay.

3275
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:50,300
So, even though it kind of looks like it would go to this one, it goes to this one because it's the third one.

3276
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:51,560
But it's not.

3277
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:53,120
It's very confusing.

3278
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:55,440
Oh my gosh.

3279
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:55,880
Wait.

3280
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:57,020
So, because like this one...

3281
02:22:57,020 --> 02:22:58,200
Does it go to all three?

3282
02:22:58,320 --> 02:22:58,900
It must.

3283
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:00,800
And then this one goes to two.

3284
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:02,500
This one goes to three.

3285
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:02,620
Okay.

3286
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:02,980
So, it's three or two.

3287
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:04,200
I can't tell.

3288
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:08,360
It's like a hex board.

3289
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:09,960
A hex board.

3290
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:12,200
Yeah, this is very, very hard.

3291
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:13,440
Wow.

3292
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:14,820
Wait.

3293
02:23:14,900 --> 02:23:19,120
So, if it's just hard, is it like a regular grid?

3294
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:21,800
It's very, very hard.

3295
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:24,180
This is for children?

3296
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:28,280
This is for...

3297
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:28,880
There you go.

3298
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:29,260
You got it.

3299
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:30,060
This is for babies?

3300
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:34,000
Are you sure?

3301
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:37,140
Are you sure?

3302
02:23:41,300 --> 02:23:42,560
Oh my gosh.

3303
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:45,820
Green nose.

3304
02:23:47,140 --> 02:23:47,740
Oh.

3305
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:48,220
Oh.

3306
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:49,440
He didn't match with this guy.

3307
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:50,120
Oh my gosh.

3308
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:55,020
Oh my gosh.

3309
02:23:57,020 --> 02:23:57,760
Oh no.

3310
02:23:57,820 --> 02:23:58,420
This feels impossible.

3311
02:23:59,140 --> 02:23:59,820
Is there...

3312
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:01,000
Is there actually...

3313
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:02,600
There's only one.

3314
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:03,720
There's only one way you could do this.

3315
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:16,110
Might have to abandon some guy's hair.

3316
02:24:24,190 --> 02:24:26,690
Alternative title, only for baby geniuses.

3317
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:34,070
So, they must have at least one matching feature with adjacent ones.

3318
02:24:34,210 --> 02:24:34,450
Yes.

3319
02:24:34,930 --> 02:24:35,770
Yes, yes, yes.

3320
02:24:35,990 --> 02:24:36,390
That's...

3321
02:24:36,390 --> 02:24:36,690
That's...

3322
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:38,670
That's the thing.

3323
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:43,570
Only one per seat.

3324
02:24:43,790 --> 02:24:44,310
Oh, sorry.

3325
02:24:44,310 --> 02:24:44,690
There you go.

3326
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:45,190
You got it.

3327
02:24:45,490 --> 02:24:45,930
Sorry.

3328
02:24:45,930 --> 02:24:46,010
Sorry.

3329
02:24:46,230 --> 02:24:47,250
Oh no.

3330
02:24:47,870 --> 02:24:48,730
Because I...

3331
02:24:50,550 --> 02:24:52,030
At least he came back.

3332
02:24:52,210 --> 02:24:52,630
Thank you.

3333
02:24:53,210 --> 02:24:54,810
Thanks for your generosity.

3334
02:24:56,090 --> 02:24:56,650
Sure.

3335
02:24:57,970 --> 02:24:59,430
So like, her.

3336
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:01,610
And then...

3337
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:05,810
What even would match here?

3338
02:25:05,950 --> 02:25:07,110
Oh, maybe like a...

3339
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:09,230
Cyclops...

3340
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:11,770
No.

3341
02:25:13,450 --> 02:25:15,590
It's like, I need a Cyclops.

3342
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:15,910
A Cyclops.

3343
02:25:15,930 --> 02:25:19,610
With a spring... with this hair.

3344
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:20,810
It's so difficult.

3345
02:25:22,030 --> 02:25:23,510
This is too complicated.

3346
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:24,590
Next puzzle.

3347
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:32,030
This one I feel like would be impossible.

3348
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:33,550
Like actually.

3349
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:41,130
Wait,

3350
02:25:44,490 --> 02:25:45,190
it's the exact same.

3351
02:25:46,190 --> 02:25:47,950
Hard Crystal is fun, is it?

3352
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:51,190
That's the one where you get to mix and match the Zumbinis, right?

3353
02:25:58,090 --> 02:26:00,590
Mint realizes she can't do any very hard puzzle.

3354
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:01,390
Hey, hey, hey!

3355
02:26:02,550 --> 02:26:04,350
I'm taste testing.

3356
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:11,890
I'm seeing why each one is very, very hard, okay?

3357
02:26:15,930 --> 02:26:17,670
This one feels the exact same though.

3358
02:26:19,970 --> 02:26:20,830
Am I...

3359
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:23,430
This one feels the exact same.

3360
02:26:23,990 --> 02:26:25,790
So we need a roller skater.

3361
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:26,410
You.

3362
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:26,490
You.

3363
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:30,770
Oh, wait.

3364
02:26:33,210 --> 02:26:33,970
Oh, it's the...

3365
02:26:33,970 --> 02:26:34,710
I...

3366
02:26:35,830 --> 02:26:36,310
Wait.

3367
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:36,610
Hmm.

3368
02:26:40,250 --> 02:26:41,110
The nose.

3369
02:26:43,490 --> 02:26:44,610
Wait, but the nose...

3370
02:26:44,610 --> 02:26:47,270
Does the nose correspond with the skates or the eyes?

3371
02:26:49,950 --> 02:26:52,130
Does the nose color correspond...?

3372
02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:53,090
Oh, jeez...

3373
02:26:53,090 --> 02:26:53,830
Okay, hold on this one.

3374
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:05,440
Okay, the hair is completely different.

3375
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:07,660
It's all mixed up.

3376
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:10,420
It's all mixed up.

3377
02:27:10,860 --> 02:27:11,820
It's all...

3378
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:13,120
Everything is wrong.

3379
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:15,460
Everything is wrong!

3380
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:19,360
Okay, so the eyes are the hair.

3381
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:25,760
So we need a scruffly hair with the booties.

3382
02:27:31,530 --> 02:27:35,890
The booties are green.

3383
02:27:37,890 --> 02:27:41,530
I'm gonna guess this because I'm trying to get this guy.

3384
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:46,190
It's either this guy or this guy.

3385
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:47,270
Let's guess

3386
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:52,780
this guy.

3387
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:55,680
Scruffed hair, nose green.

3388
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:56,200
Yeah.

3389
02:27:58,340 --> 02:27:59,940
But both of them have green noses.

3390
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:01,940
Let's do this one.

3391
02:28:02,820 --> 02:28:03,380
Wait.

3392
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:05,120
No, this one.

3393
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:06,760
Yeah!

3394
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:10,740
Okay.

3395
02:28:10,740 --> 02:28:11,720
Okay, okay, okay.

3396
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:19,540
So the first one... So it's green nose corresponds to the feet.

3397
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:22,700
Okay.

3398
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:27,020
So we need a green nose and we need a yellow nose.

3399
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:28,320
Okay.

3400
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:28,320
So we need a green nose and we need a yellow nose.

3401
02:28:31,300 --> 02:28:31,940
Okay.

3402
02:28:33,590 --> 02:28:34,230
Right?

3403
02:28:35,350 --> 02:28:37,050
Green nose and yellow nose.

3404
02:28:43,930 --> 02:28:45,770
So I'm gonna separate.

3405
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:48,710
You go over... You... Everybody else go over here.

3406
02:28:50,330 --> 02:28:52,130
Green nose, yellow nose.

3407
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:55,670
And not scruffly hair.

3408
02:28:56,130 --> 02:28:56,890
Oh wait.

3409
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:57,210
Yes?

3410
02:28:57,470 --> 02:28:57,950
Wait.

3411
02:28:58,290 --> 02:28:59,450
I'm forgetting words.

3412
02:28:59,450 --> 02:28:59,910
I'm forgetting words.

3413
02:28:59,950 --> 02:28:59,950
I'm forgetting words.

3414
02:28:59,950 --> 02:28:59,950
I'm forgetting words.

3415
02:28:59,950 --> 02:28:59,950
I'm forgetting words.

3416
02:28:59,970 --> 02:29:00,130
What?

3417
02:29:00,330 --> 02:29:01,510
Corresponded to what part?

3418
02:29:03,270 --> 02:29:03,910
Wait.

3419
02:29:04,350 --> 02:29:08,450
The hair corresponded to the eyes.

3420
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:11,170
The hair's corresponded to the eyes.

3421
02:29:11,450 --> 02:29:13,650
So no scruffly hair.

3422
02:29:14,330 --> 02:29:16,670
We need dotted eyes.

3423
02:29:17,570 --> 02:29:18,990
We need you.

3424
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:28,600
Just kidding.

3425
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:30,460
Oh, dang it.

3426
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:30,980
I got the hair.

3427
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:31,840
Never mind.

3428
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:32,220
Wait.

3429
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:33,640
No scruffly hair is what I said.

3430
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:34,680
Wait.

3431
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,160
Oh, it was this hair.

3432
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:36,860
Oh my gosh.

3433
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:37,980
I'm so silly.

3434
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:39,660
I got it wrong.

3435
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:41,540
It's him though.

3436
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:42,060
It's him.

3437
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:44,620
What?

3438
02:29:49,610 --> 02:29:51,230
We're gonna lose a few zumbinis.

3439
02:29:54,980 --> 02:29:55,380
Wait.

3440
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:04,640
Is it not the... Okay.

3441
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:06,860
Huh?

3442
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:11,840
Hm?

3443
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:15,200
The green corresponds to the feet.

3444
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:17,540
So it's her then?

3445
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:18,700
Cause we...

3446
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:21,560
Wait.

3447
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:23,340
What does the eyes correspond to then?

3448
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:24,140
The hair.

3449
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:26,440
Eyes correspond to the hair.

3450
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:28,640
I can't keep track of this.

3451
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:29,860
I need this written down.

3452
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,580
I can't keep track of it in my brain.

3453
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:32,520
I'm a visual person.

3454
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:35,080
Okay.

3455
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:35,620
Goodbye.

3456
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:38,600
Goodbye scruffled... scruffled hair, yellow nose.

3457
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:40,640
Scruffled hair, yellow nose.

3458
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:42,840
Scruffled hair, yellow nose.

3459
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:46,830
Oh.

3460
02:30:47,870 --> 02:30:49,850
He just walks off.

3461
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:51,350
See ya.

3462
02:30:51,510 --> 02:30:52,010
Okay.

3463
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:53,410
Alrighty.

3464
02:30:53,590 --> 02:30:56,230
Alrighty, alrighty, alrighty, alrighty, alrighty, alrighty, alrighty.

3465
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:59,290
The feet correspond with the nose color.

3466
02:30:59,930 --> 02:31:01,210
So... what?

3467
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:02,210
We have all yellow.

3468
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:03,350
Two.

3469
02:31:03,350 --> 02:31:03,810
Two.

3470
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:04,670
Thank you.

3471
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:13,210
And we need... the eye color... or the eye corresponds to the...

3472
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:17,420
To the hair.

3473
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:20,180
It's her.

3474
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:22,540
Wait.

3475
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:22,940
No.

3476
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:23,220
Hold on.

3477
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:23,620
Hold on.

3478
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:23,960
Hold on.

3479
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:27,020
Wait.

3480
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:28,420
I'm so confused.

3481
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:32,440
Wait.

3482
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:34,960
I really need this written out for real.

3483
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:39,760
I need this written out for real.

3484
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:47,850
What went to the... Wait.

3485
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:49,530
What changes the hair again?

3486
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:54,380
What changes... Yeah.

3487
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:55,000
Take notes.

3488
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:56,100
I need to.

3489
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:57,360
My brain can't.

3490
02:31:58,740 --> 02:31:59,760
Oh my gosh.

3491
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:10,370
Zumbini hair equals... eyes.

3492
02:32:11,810 --> 02:32:12,330
Okay.

3493
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:17,340
So... Okay.

3494
02:32:17,380 --> 02:32:18,120
It's one of these guys.

3495
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:18,460
Okay.

3496
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:18,860
It's not her.

3497
02:32:20,220 --> 02:32:21,260
It's one of these guys.

3498
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:21,260
Okay.

3499
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:21,260
It's not her.

3500
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:21,300
It's one of these guys.

3501
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:27,060
Feet... become...

3502
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:29,640
Do we have any roller blade guys?

3503
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:31,280
We don't.

3504
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:36,240
Feet become...

3505
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:38,080
Feet.

3506
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:38,800
No.

3507
02:32:46,120 --> 02:32:46,640
Wait.

3508
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:47,160
So...

3509
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:49,020
Let's see.

3510
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:49,840
What is it?

3511
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:51,800
Feet change the nose color?

3512
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:52,960
Is that what it is?

3513
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:56,360
No.

3514
02:32:57,740 --> 02:32:59,440
Eyes change the nose color.

3515
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:03,180
Eyes change the nose color.

3516
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:04,720
It must be.

3517
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:05,260
Right?

3518
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:06,500
Because...

3519
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:09,340
They have the same.

3520
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:11,280
But they... Oh.

3521
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:12,760
They also have the same nose.

3522
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:13,380
But also.

3523
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:14,960
I think.

3524
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:16,500
And then...

3525
02:33:17,060 --> 02:33:18,000
And then...

3526
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,800
What else can we change?

3527
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:21,180
Oh.

3528
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:21,800
The legs.

3529
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:23,140
Legs determine...

3530
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:25,600
Some...

3531
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:27,960
I really need this right now.

3532
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:31,440
I think it's the left boy.

3533
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:31,780
Hold on.

3534
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:33,140
I need to figure out why though.

3535
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:35,080
What else is...

3536
02:33:37,490 --> 02:33:37,930
Wait.

3537
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:39,510
What does... What changes the...

3538
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:41,850
Hold on.

3539
02:33:41,870 --> 02:33:43,030
I'm writing this in a notepad.

3540
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:43,350
Okay.

3541
02:33:47,790 --> 02:33:49,290
Hair equals feet.

3542
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:52,010
For the Zoombinis.

3543
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:54,450
For the Zoombinis.

3544
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:55,370
Uh...

3545
02:33:56,450 --> 02:33:59,210
Eyes equals nose color.

3546
02:34:00,250 --> 02:34:03,650
Zoombini eyes equals nose color.

3547
02:34:04,810 --> 02:34:05,670
Then...

3548
02:34:06,730 --> 02:34:07,590
Then...

3549
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:12,680
Then...

3550
02:34:14,380 --> 02:34:16,800
What changes the...

3551
02:34:18,450 --> 02:34:19,880
So it would be...

3552
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:24,500
What do all three... Do these three have in common?

3553
02:34:24,980 --> 02:34:25,840
What

3554
02:34:30,860 --> 02:34:32,040
do they have in common to...

3555
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:33,660
Get this hair color?

3556
02:34:40,530 --> 02:34:41,850
The nose is the feet?

3557
02:34:43,550 --> 02:34:43,910
Oh.

3558
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,250
You're right.

3559
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:44,970
Oh.

3560
02:34:44,990 --> 02:34:45,310
You're right.

3561
02:34:45,410 --> 02:34:45,610
You're right.

3562
02:34:45,650 --> 02:34:45,890
You're right.

3563
02:34:46,730 --> 02:34:47,090
Nose...

3564
02:34:47,790 --> 02:34:48,150
Wait.

3565
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:48,430
Huh?

3566
02:34:48,590 --> 02:34:49,750
It's not the hair equals...

3567
02:34:49,750 --> 02:34:50,190
Wait.

3568
02:34:51,170 --> 02:34:51,530
Oh.

3569
02:34:51,530 --> 02:34:51,890
Oh.

3570
02:34:51,990 --> 02:34:52,330
Oh.

3571
02:34:52,390 --> 02:34:52,750
Oh.

3572
02:34:52,750 --> 02:34:52,930
Wait.

3573
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:53,130
Wait.

3574
02:34:53,170 --> 02:34:53,270
Wait.

3575
02:34:53,270 --> 02:34:53,390
Wait.

3576
02:34:53,390 --> 02:34:53,510
Oh.

3577
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:54,370
Nose...

3578
02:34:54,370 --> 02:34:54,910
Okay.

3579
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:55,090
Sorry.

3580
02:34:55,370 --> 02:34:58,530
Zoombini nose equals feet.

3581
02:34:58,670 --> 02:34:59,190
You're right.

3582
02:34:59,250 --> 02:34:59,590
Yes.

3583
02:34:59,890 --> 02:35:02,110
Zoombini nose equals feet.

3584
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:04,510
So what does that leave?

3585
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:07,950
I have...

3586
02:35:07,950 --> 02:35:08,050
Oh.

3587
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:08,490
I need...

3588
02:35:08,490 --> 02:35:10,230
Zoombini feet equals...

3589
02:35:12,530 --> 02:35:13,650
What do I not have?

3590
02:35:14,370 --> 02:35:16,050
So the feet equals the hair?

3591
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:17,470
But that doesn't make any sense.

3592
02:35:18,310 --> 02:35:20,870
Because these three have the same hair.

3593
02:35:22,110 --> 02:35:24,010
These guys have nothing in common.

3594
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:36,400
Seems like feet don't mean anything.

3595
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:38,380
Thank you!

3596
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:41,000
You seem...

3597
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,480
You strike me as the kind of ghost who...

3598
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:45,000
grew up with brain quest.

3599
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:45,860
Confirm deny.

3600
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:48,400
I don't know what brain quest is.

3601
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:48,920
So...

3602
02:35:49,300 --> 02:35:50,480
I guess I must deny.

3603
02:35:54,020 --> 02:35:55,860
Fleeing hair is currently unbound.

3604
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:57,180
Oh my gosh.

3605
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:57,700
So it's random?

3606
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:01,960
So it's either...

3607
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:03,080
It's one of these guys?

3608
02:36:07,730 --> 02:36:08,410
Oh no.

3609
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:10,750
It's just one of them?

3610
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:11,410
We don't know?

3611
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:16,350
I don't feel like...

3612
02:36:16,350 --> 02:36:18,210
No way there's no logic to it.

3613
02:36:18,270 --> 02:36:18,410
Right?

3614
02:36:18,410 --> 02:36:19,050
Like...

3615
02:36:19,050 --> 02:36:19,990
But...

3616
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:21,230
But seriously...

3617
02:36:21,230 --> 02:36:22,090
Like how could...

3618
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:23,610
This hair...

3619
02:36:23,610 --> 02:36:25,190
And these three guys...

3620
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,450
You know?

3621
02:36:25,590 --> 02:36:26,190
Like...

3622
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:28,370
That doesn't make any sense.

3623
02:36:33,770 --> 02:36:34,570
Okay guys.

3624
02:36:34,710 --> 02:36:35,550
Let's make a poll.

3625
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:38,610
Let's make a poll.

3626
02:36:39,490 --> 02:36:40,090
Which...

3627
02:36:41,450 --> 02:36:42,650
Which Zoombini?

3628
02:36:43,710 --> 02:36:44,310
Left?

3629
02:36:44,990 --> 02:36:45,590
Right?

3630
02:36:46,250 --> 02:36:46,850
Okay.

3631
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:48,950
Which Zoombini?

3632
02:36:49,490 --> 02:36:50,670
On the left!

3633
02:36:50,670 --> 02:36:51,590
We have...

3634
02:36:51,590 --> 02:36:54,410
Rollerblade Madness!

3635
02:36:55,570 --> 02:36:57,910
He is insane.

3636
02:36:57,970 --> 02:37:00,890
He will do wheelies for hours.

3637
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:03,350
He is always grinding.

3638
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:07,210
Every moment he gets.

3639
02:37:07,350 --> 02:37:08,510
Rollerblade Madness.

3640
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:10,030
On the left...

3641
02:37:10,190 --> 02:37:10,390
I mean...

3642
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:10,590
Sorry.

3643
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:11,390
On the right...

3644
02:37:11,390 --> 02:37:13,250
We have Walk.

3645
02:37:13,470 --> 02:37:16,170
This guy can walk.

3646
02:37:16,230 --> 02:37:17,630
He is just...

3647
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:23,680
Even the poll isn't sure.

3648
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:25,500
Then it's not just me.

3649
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:29,120
Oh man.

3650
02:37:29,660 --> 02:37:30,960
Wait so...

3651
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:46,020
Right's feet corresponds to fleeing cowboy boots.

3652
02:37:46,140 --> 02:37:46,560
No, no, no.

3653
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:48,000
Nelson?

3654
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:49,180
Nelson?

3655
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:51,960
You are living in the past.

3656
02:37:52,260 --> 02:37:53,560
This is the present.

3657
02:37:54,300 --> 02:37:56,580
We are on very, very hard.

3658
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:59,440
Where all logic has been thrown out the window.

3659
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:03,480
It is different here.

3660
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:06,200
Watch it not be either of these two.

3661
02:38:06,460 --> 02:38:06,700
Alright.

3662
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:08,260
59% said left.

3663
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:09,320
So let's go with left.

3664
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,180
Okay.

3665
02:38:19,690 --> 02:38:21,070
It's all the features.

3666
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:24,270
It's all the features.

3667
02:38:24,630 --> 02:38:25,650
But the hair.

3668
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:28,190
No way.

3669
02:38:28,270 --> 02:38:29,230
It's actually random.

3670
02:38:29,490 --> 02:38:31,030
Because look, this one...

3671
02:38:31,030 --> 02:38:31,910
Goes to...

3672
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:32,130
No.

3673
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:35,190
They have nothing in common!

3674
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:10,160
Sheesh!

3675
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:12,360
That one was crazy.

3676
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:14,760
Someone said the crystal one is...

3677
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:16,400
Wait, did they say the crystal one was fun?

3678
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:17,760
Oh yeah, yeah, with the...

3679
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:21,780
Oh!

3680
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:23,580
Wait...

3681
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:27,040
Bing!

3682
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:30,760
So we have to make...

3683
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:31,900
Huh?

3684
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:33,540
Huh?

3685
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:34,940
Huh?

3686
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:37,000
Oh!

3687
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:39,680
Wait...

3688
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:39,880
Huh?

3689
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:41,960
Huh?

3690
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:43,460
Huh?

3691
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:46,200
Huh?

3692
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:49,000
Oh!

3693
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:52,360
Do I have to wait for it to come back?

3694
02:39:55,240 --> 02:39:55,600
No!

3695
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:56,540
That's not what I picked!

3696
02:39:57,240 --> 02:39:58,120
That's not what I picked!

3697
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:20,720
Can you put one on the left as well?

3698
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:22,820
Oh, you can!

3699
02:40:24,380 --> 02:40:24,820
You can!

3700
02:40:25,940 --> 02:40:26,540
You can.

3701
02:40:26,820 --> 02:40:29,980
But I'm so concerned about it looking like it's yellow.

3702
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:33,060
Oh wait.

3703
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:34,460
Oh, this is a combo.

3704
02:40:34,940 --> 02:40:35,380
Wait.

3705
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:36,060
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3706
02:40:36,300 --> 02:40:36,860
Hold on.

3707
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:41,360
I don't know if it matters, but...

3708
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:45,000
Now it's saying it's pink?

3709
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:50,620
Why is it changing colors?

3710
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:52,560
Why can't you just be yellow?

3711
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:54,300
This is so confusing.

3712
02:40:54,560 --> 02:40:54,740
What?

3713
02:40:57,740 --> 02:40:59,820
The nose changes colors when you move spaces.

3714
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:01,820
Yeah, it was...

3715
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:04,060
Yellow on this side.

3716
02:41:05,060 --> 02:41:06,920
So I think I have to get the right...

3717
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:08,420
Com...

3718
02:41:08,420 --> 02:41:09,780
Oh, see, see, see!

3719
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:10,700
This is the right combination.

3720
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:12,660
But there's no other...

3721
02:41:13,220 --> 02:41:13,660
Unless...

3722
02:41:13,660 --> 02:41:14,240
Unless...

3723
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:14,980
It's...

3724
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:17,700
No...

3725
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:20,140
I gotta get the...

3726
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:21,620
The wombo combo.

3727
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:23,340
No?

3728
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:24,340
Never mind.

3729
02:41:26,300 --> 02:41:28,580
But there's no other way to change the nose color.

3730
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:32,740
I had it?

3731
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,020
Oh, it's yellow!

3732
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:36,480
Sorry.

3733
02:41:36,860 --> 02:41:37,300
Yes.

3734
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:38,020
It's yellow.

3735
02:41:38,180 --> 02:41:38,640
You're right.

3736
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:39,120
You're right.

3737
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:39,420
You're right.

3738
02:41:40,180 --> 02:41:40,620
Sorry.

3739
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,620
For some reason, I was thinking a different color.

3740
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:42,940
Okay.

3741
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:43,440
You're so right.

3742
02:41:45,180 --> 02:41:46,060
So that...

3743
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:47,400
Should...

3744
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:48,620
Do...

3745
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:49,420
It!

3746
02:41:50,300 --> 02:41:50,780
What the?

3747
02:41:51,500 --> 02:41:52,520
Who are you?

3748
02:41:55,160 --> 02:41:55,780
What?

3749
02:42:16,370 --> 02:42:18,650
A stranger appeared, you guys.

3750
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:26,020
I don't understand it at all.

3751
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:31,100
I don't understand it at all!

3752
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:35,740
How am I supposed to do two hairstyles at once?

3753
02:42:48,390 --> 02:42:49,610
Try the question mark.

3754
02:43:02,690 --> 02:43:05,190
Making mistakes is life or death, narrator!

3755
02:43:05,850 --> 02:43:10,270
If a few of our little blue friends are left behind, they'll be waiting at shade tree to try again.

3756
02:43:17,730 --> 02:43:18,270
Becoming protection.

3757
02:43:19,050 --> 02:43:19,970
Okay.

3758
02:43:20,370 --> 02:43:23,510
This doesn't make me feel any better.

3759
02:43:28,550 --> 02:43:30,450
These ones don't change.

3760
02:43:31,570 --> 02:43:32,490
There's...

3761
02:43:34,470 --> 02:43:35,870
There's... I need yellow.

3762
02:43:36,330 --> 02:43:36,870
Right?

3763
02:43:37,130 --> 02:43:37,890
For her.

3764
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:40,110
What is going on?

3765
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:43,590
What is happening?

3766
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:43,830
What is happening?

3767
02:43:46,270 --> 02:43:47,870
How am I supposed to get this haircut?

3768
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:54,620
It makes no sense.

3769
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:57,740
No wonder I couldn't beat this.

3770
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:59,460
It doesn't make any sense.

3771
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:01,340
Am I... Am I...

3772
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:02,740
Am I the...

3773
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:09,100
No, I need a degree for this game.

3774
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:15,540
Glasses plus nose and spring on left.

3775
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:20,020
But why?

3776
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:23,000
Also, does it matter?

3777
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:25,820
The... Because it's red.

3778
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:28,880
It's gonna make it red.

3779
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:40,060
Two.

3780
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:40,900
Thank you.

3781
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:44,100
I don't think I need the glasses.

3782
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:46,160
Here, right?

3783
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:47,240
I just need this?

3784
02:44:50,420 --> 02:44:50,940
Wait.

3785
02:44:54,950 --> 02:44:56,030
Oh, I see.

3786
02:44:56,070 --> 02:44:56,350
I see.

3787
02:44:56,370 --> 02:44:56,950
Okay.

3788
02:44:57,150 --> 02:44:57,430
Okay.

3789
02:44:57,530 --> 02:44:57,810
Hold on.

3790
02:44:58,270 --> 02:45:00,770
So, I need them to both have this hairstyle.

3791
02:45:01,530 --> 02:45:02,330
First of all.

3792
02:45:02,390 --> 02:45:03,910
Because they're both gonna match the hair.

3793
02:45:04,150 --> 02:45:04,550
Okay.

3794
02:45:05,210 --> 02:45:05,610
Okay.

3795
02:45:06,130 --> 02:45:07,510
We don't need the nose.

3796
02:45:08,670 --> 02:45:09,830
Because... And we need the spring.

3797
02:45:13,270 --> 02:45:15,030
So, she's going to become...

3798
02:45:16,410 --> 02:45:17,110
Like this.

3799
02:45:18,130 --> 02:45:18,530
Okay.

3800
02:45:19,370 --> 02:45:19,770
Okay.

3801
02:45:20,130 --> 02:45:20,530
Okay.

3802
02:45:20,570 --> 02:45:20,910
Okay.

3803
02:45:20,930 --> 02:45:21,210
Okay.

3804
02:45:21,250 --> 02:45:21,470
Okay.

3805
02:45:21,470 --> 02:45:21,650
Okay.

3806
02:45:21,650 --> 02:45:21,810
Okay.

3807
02:45:21,810 --> 02:45:21,930
Okay.

3808
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:23,510
Oh, but we need the...

3809
02:45:23,510 --> 02:45:24,490
Actually, we do need the nose.

3810
02:45:24,670 --> 02:45:25,110
Oh, shoot.

3811
02:45:25,570 --> 02:45:25,930
Wait.

3812
02:45:26,010 --> 02:45:27,250
We do need the nose for her.

3813
02:45:29,130 --> 02:45:29,990
Can I do three?

3814
02:45:30,690 --> 02:45:31,270
Oh, I can.

3815
02:45:37,910 --> 02:45:38,270
Okay.

3816
02:45:38,670 --> 02:45:38,990
Okay.

3817
02:45:39,110 --> 02:45:39,970
This should be it.

3818
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:40,670
This should be it.

3819
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:43,110
Does it need to be in order or...

3820
02:45:56,470 --> 02:45:58,350
It doesn't need to be in order, clearly.

3821
02:46:01,370 --> 02:46:02,150
We cooked.

3822
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:03,350
Yeah.

3823
02:46:06,170 --> 02:46:07,170
That one was...

3824
02:46:07,170 --> 02:46:07,990
This is crazy.

3825
02:46:08,050 --> 02:46:09,250
I get it now, though.

3826
02:46:09,310 --> 02:46:09,810
I get it.

3827
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:10,170
I get it.

3828
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:10,570
I get it.

3829
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:11,350
So, it...

3830
02:46:11,350 --> 02:46:11,850
Okay.

3831
02:46:12,730 --> 02:46:13,130
Interesting.

3832
02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:14,330
Interesting.

3833
02:46:14,670 --> 02:46:15,070
Interesting.

3834
02:46:16,770 --> 02:46:17,570
God gamer.

3835
02:46:21,390 --> 02:46:22,250
This one's fine.

3836
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:22,590
Okay.

3837
02:46:22,630 --> 02:46:24,070
This one's actually pretty interesting.

3838
02:46:24,610 --> 02:46:25,010
Okay.

3839
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:27,570
Okay.

3840
02:46:29,410 --> 02:46:29,810
Okay.

3841
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:31,010
Well, I'll just have the same hair.

3842
02:46:31,110 --> 02:46:31,350
Okay.

3843
02:46:31,350 --> 02:46:32,230
Sounds good to me.

3844
02:46:32,330 --> 02:46:33,330
Sounds good to me.

3845
02:46:35,890 --> 02:46:38,890
Now, if I just match these...

3846
02:46:39,990 --> 02:46:40,530
No.

3847
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:45,220
Skates.

3848
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:55,320
Hmm.

3849
02:46:57,080 --> 02:46:58,160
Big brain.

3850
02:47:11,850 --> 02:47:13,650
Probably matters the order of the mirrors.

3851
02:47:13,690 --> 02:47:15,010
It didn't seem like it before.

3852
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:15,710
Okay.

3853
02:47:17,250 --> 02:47:17,790
Okay.

3854
02:47:18,530 --> 02:47:19,070
Okay.

3855
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:20,250
So, I'm not quite sure.

3856
02:47:34,670 --> 02:47:35,350
Wait.

3857
02:47:38,210 --> 02:47:39,970
So, I have a question.

3858
02:47:40,330 --> 02:47:41,290
I wonder...

3859
02:47:41,910 --> 02:47:45,210
I wonder if it, like, starts...

3860
02:47:45,210 --> 02:47:45,950
Wait.

3861
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:47,770
Does it cycle through these?

3862
02:47:48,290 --> 02:47:49,810
Like, even when we're going through?

3863
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:52,510
It wouldn't do that to us, right?

3864
02:47:55,910 --> 02:47:58,350
We do definitely have to change the eyes.

3865
02:47:59,310 --> 02:48:00,190
Like, so...

3866
02:48:00,750 --> 02:48:02,170
For example, I do this.

3867
02:48:04,510 --> 02:48:05,850
No, that makes no sense.

3868
02:48:09,730 --> 02:48:11,170
Why are these ones flashing?

3869
02:48:11,370 --> 02:48:12,310
It makes me nervous.

3870
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:16,050
Oh, because I can change it to something else.

3871
02:48:17,150 --> 02:48:17,590
Oh.

3872
02:48:20,910 --> 02:48:22,690
Front will replace the back?

3873
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:24,230
It will?

3874
02:48:26,430 --> 02:48:27,990
Are we sure about that?

3875
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:30,410
Wait.

3876
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:30,690
Okay.

3877
02:48:30,790 --> 02:48:31,330
So...

3878
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:36,390
Hold on.

3879
02:48:36,410 --> 02:48:39,510
I'm just gonna place some things on the side.

3880
02:48:40,770 --> 02:48:42,390
I'm just gonna place...

3881
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:49,220
So, if I have it...

3882
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:49,980
Hair?

3883
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:50,440
Hair?

3884
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:52,520
Hair?

3885
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:54,160
Hair?

3886
02:48:56,610 --> 02:48:57,090
Wait.

3887
02:48:57,130 --> 02:48:58,150
All we need for this one...

3888
02:48:58,150 --> 02:48:58,310
Okay.

3889
02:48:58,970 --> 02:49:00,490
If it's this...

3890
02:49:00,490 --> 02:49:01,230
First?

3891
02:49:03,050 --> 02:49:03,530
Huh?

3892
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:05,710
Oh, well, this one's also...

3893
02:49:05,710 --> 02:49:05,990
Never mind.

3894
02:49:06,170 --> 02:49:07,750
This one also is gonna get the hair.

3895
02:49:09,250 --> 02:49:10,830
Still need the eyes on the left.

3896
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:12,390
Yeah.

3897
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:14,410
You're right.

3898
02:49:22,820 --> 02:49:23,300
Boom.

3899
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:27,560
This one turns into a plane.

3900
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:29,480
This one...

3901
02:49:29,480 --> 02:49:30,100
Oh.

3902
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:30,520
Oh.

3903
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:31,460
Oh.

3904
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:32,020
Oh.

3905
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:32,580
Ah.

3906
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:32,620
Oh.

3907
02:49:32,620 --> 02:49:32,840
Ah.

3908
02:49:33,300 --> 02:49:33,920
Oh-oh.

3909
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:35,060
I think I'm breaking the game.

3910
02:49:37,180 --> 02:49:38,520
Is this the one I...

3911
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:39,040
Wait.

3912
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:39,600
This one.

3913
02:49:39,740 --> 02:49:40,300
Take out.

3914
02:49:46,230 --> 02:49:48,590
My Oshi with the 998 IQ.

3915
02:49:50,430 --> 02:49:52,150
Think of it like Photoshop layers.

3916
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:53,810
Okay.

3917
02:49:55,330 --> 02:49:56,090
I think...

3918
02:49:56,090 --> 02:49:56,550
Oh, I...

3919
02:49:56,550 --> 02:49:57,090
Okay.

3920
02:49:57,170 --> 02:49:57,890
I get it.

3921
02:49:57,950 --> 02:49:58,390
I get it.

3922
02:49:59,090 --> 02:49:59,770
I think.

3923
02:50:01,090 --> 02:50:01,970
I think.

3924
02:50:02,130 --> 02:50:02,270
I think...

3925
02:50:02,270 --> 02:50:02,830
I think.

3926
02:50:02,830 --> 02:50:06,650
But we need the eyes... here.

3927
02:50:07,570 --> 02:50:07,930
Okay.

3928
02:50:09,530 --> 02:50:10,250
But...

3929
02:50:13,770 --> 02:50:17,930
Well we only... need... okay.

3930
02:50:18,550 --> 02:50:22,910
Essentially what I'm like... struggling with is...

3931
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:33,720
Is this guy and this guy... they have mostly matching features.

3932
02:50:33,820 --> 02:50:34,800
We need the nose though.

3933
02:50:36,020 --> 02:50:36,180
Ah...

3934
02:50:46,110 --> 02:50:48,610
Layer closest to the middle is the top layer.

3935
02:50:49,270 --> 02:50:49,750
Yeah...

3936
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:53,550
But I think what I'm confused about is how it will work the second round.

3937
02:50:53,690 --> 02:50:54,190
You know what I mean?

3938
02:50:55,410 --> 02:50:55,890
Like...

3939
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:01,700
So... the spark will hap...

3940
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:05,880
So... the first... so I... this...

3941
02:51:06,380 --> 02:51:07,500
Wait, will this last?

3942
02:51:09,360 --> 02:51:09,800
All...

3943
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:12,620
Yeah,

3944
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:21,120
the blocks won't change, only the turntable and the zoomines.

3945
02:51:21,320 --> 02:51:21,700
Exactly.

3946
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:22,920
So I need them to...

3947
02:51:23,740 --> 02:51:26,140
It feels like I need them to match on both sides.

3948
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:28,420
Like... or have the same exact things.

3949
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:31,980
But the... when I put the plates... when I put these crystals down, they don't.

3950
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:35,320
See?

3951
02:51:36,260 --> 02:51:38,140
We get a little propeller man.

3952
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:39,840
Get this...

3953
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:41,460
Don't worry about the flashing.

3954
02:51:45,740 --> 02:51:46,800
Are you sure?

3955
02:51:57,080 --> 02:51:57,680
Okay.

3956
02:51:59,280 --> 02:51:59,880
Oh!

3957
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:03,100
Okay, wait, I think I get it.

3958
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:06,000
Okay, so because this is in front...

3959
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:08,680
It won't recognize the wheel.

3960
02:52:08,680 --> 02:52:09,480
Right?

3961
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:10,480
Is that what you...

3962
02:52:10,480 --> 02:52:10,660
Okay.

3963
02:52:11,560 --> 02:52:13,100
So... it'll be like...

3964
02:52:13,100 --> 02:52:17,500
Okay, the hair is on, the nose and this is on, and then the eyes are on.

3965
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:22,140
So then...

3966
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:27,180
You guys, the game is breaking.

3967
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:29,900
Oh no, he's stuck!

3968
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:31,800
Oh, okay, we're good.

3969
02:52:33,460 --> 02:52:33,900
Okay.

3970
02:52:36,020 --> 02:52:36,460
No!

3971
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:38,660
Uh oh.

3972
02:52:38,660 --> 02:52:40,480
You guys, I think I broke the game.

3973
02:52:45,210 --> 02:52:47,830
I think I broke the game.

3974
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:54,780
Oh no!

3975
02:52:58,770 --> 02:53:01,930
Oh, we were so close right when I got it!

3976
02:53:03,290 --> 02:53:05,050
Right when I understood!

3977
02:53:06,330 --> 02:53:07,010
We...

3978
02:53:07,010 --> 02:53:07,470
I...

3979
02:53:07,470 --> 02:53:08,150
No!

3980
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:12,110
Right when I understood!

3981
02:53:14,910 --> 02:53:15,590
Oh!

3982
02:53:15,890 --> 02:53:16,390
Oh!

3983
02:53:16,770 --> 02:53:17,450
Oh!

3984
02:53:17,450 --> 02:53:18,970
Okay, I'm gonna try anyway.

3985
02:53:26,750 --> 02:53:27,950
It made a noise.

3986
02:53:32,570 --> 02:53:35,090
Who was that?

3987
02:53:36,510 --> 02:53:37,350
Wait, what?

3988
02:53:37,470 --> 02:53:38,030
Why is...

3989
02:53:38,030 --> 02:53:41,150
It changed the hair to the girl's hair!

3990
02:53:41,910 --> 02:53:42,470
Why?

3991
02:53:43,950 --> 02:53:44,510
What?

3992
02:53:48,740 --> 02:53:50,780
I think the game broke a little.

3993
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,600
It was this hair before!

3994
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:58,720
Okay, okay, let's redo, redo, redo, redo.

3995
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:01,240
Redo, redo, redo, redo.

3996
02:54:10,070 --> 02:54:10,630
Okay.

3997
02:54:20,750 --> 02:54:22,570
No, the nose is fine.

3998
02:54:25,610 --> 02:54:26,170
Um.

3999
02:54:33,420 --> 02:54:37,600
We'll just do... does it matter if I... what legs I do?

4000
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:39,180
I guess?

4001
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,400
I guess it wants me to do these.

4002
02:54:43,580 --> 02:54:45,120
Because it gave me two of them.

4003
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:49,220
Okay, does this look correct?

4004
02:54:52,580 --> 02:54:54,670
It gives us the eyes, the...

4005
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:57,940
Thank you.

4006
02:54:59,560 --> 02:55:00,640
That looks correct?

4007
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:05,200
Yeah!

4008
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:05,600
Yippee!

4009
02:55:08,260 --> 02:55:09,960
Wait, why does it have a pink nose?

4010
02:55:11,500 --> 02:55:12,860
Where'd the green nose go?

4011
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:13,480
You know what?

4012
02:55:13,940 --> 02:55:14,580
It's fine.

4013
02:55:14,680 --> 02:55:15,360
They made it through.

4014
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:18,660
Okay!

4015
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:20,500
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4016
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:22,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4017
02:55:24,780 --> 02:55:26,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4018
02:55:27,380 --> 02:55:27,960
Let's see.

4019
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:37,380
Let's see what the...

4020
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:38,040
other hair is.

4021
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:42,100
Okay, okay.

4022
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:47,620
What's the glasses on the side?

4023
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:49,240
Sad.

4024
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:51,880
Sad.

4025
02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:54,280
What was it on the side?

4026
02:55:55,960 --> 02:55:56,480
Glasses.

4027
02:55:58,060 --> 02:55:58,580
Sad.

4028
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:06,460
How logical are these Zoombinis, chat?

4029
02:56:06,460 --> 02:56:08,820
There is something going on here.

4030
02:56:09,460 --> 02:56:11,080
I'm not gonna play for too much longer.

4031
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:12,880
Um, actually, you know what?

4032
02:56:13,140 --> 02:56:15,520
Because I do want to see a few of the other things...

4033
02:56:16,460 --> 02:56:18,180
on the super hard, let's go back.

4034
02:56:19,560 --> 02:56:22,520
Um... Sorry, I meant very, very hard.

4035
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:23,840
We're, like, at the hardest.

4036
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:24,820
Like the... this one.

4037
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:28,740
It's the exact same.

4038
02:56:33,980 --> 02:56:35,140
It's the exact same.

4039
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:35,600
It's the exact same.

4040
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:35,620
It's the exact same.

4041
02:56:35,620 --> 02:56:35,660
It's the exact same.

4042
02:56:36,040 --> 02:56:36,440
It's the exact same.

4043
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:40,580
Maybe it's, like, tinier traits that he likes and dislikes.

4044
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Okay, never mind.

4045
02:56:43,480 --> 02:56:44,780
Yes, but trickier.

4046
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:48,160
I think these ones are typically gonna be the same.

4047
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:49,780
This one I know has a lot more rooms.

4048
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:51,500
What?!

4049
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:52,460
Hello!

4050
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,820
Guess what?

4051
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:56,440
We're going on tour!

4052
02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:59,900
But thanks to you and your cousins, this place has grown!

4053
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:02,740
You are too much!

4054
02:57:03,500 --> 02:57:04,020
Mwah!

4055
02:57:04,940 --> 02:57:06,420
Can't drop down right now.

4056
02:57:06,420 --> 02:57:07,800
But have fun!

4057
02:57:07,980 --> 02:57:09,600
It's better than having none!

4058
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:13,360
I didn't expect this many rooms!

4059
02:57:14,540 --> 02:57:15,920
Oh my god!

4060
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:17,140
What?!

4061
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:20,400
I've never seen this many rooms before.

4062
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:24,780
What if I just stick you here?

4063
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:37,240
Okay...

4064
02:57:37,240 --> 02:57:39,400
But they all... they went into the...

4065
02:57:39,400 --> 02:57:41,200
This one is in half, though.

4066
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:44,780
This one is in half, though.

4067
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:54,660
Why are there so many rooms?

4068
02:57:55,720 --> 02:57:56,260
What?

4069
02:57:58,960 --> 02:57:59,500
Huh?

4070
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:12,600
Thank you!

4071
02:58:13,580 --> 02:58:15,860
Did you see the first episode of the Blue Archive anime?

4072
02:58:16,060 --> 02:58:16,360
Yes!

4073
02:58:16,360 --> 02:58:17,120
I watched it!

4074
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:18,580
I actually watched it earlier.

4075
02:58:18,840 --> 02:58:20,000
I watched it before stream.

4076
02:58:20,360 --> 02:58:21,100
Oh my gosh!

4077
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:24,280
They're so cute!

4078
02:58:24,340 --> 02:58:27,800
The opening is so cute!

4079
02:58:28,620 --> 02:58:30,580
It's five by five by five.

4080
02:58:30,900 --> 02:58:31,840
Yeah, but...

4081
02:58:33,400 --> 02:58:35,180
Wait, is it already starting to get darker?

4082
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:37,880
Is the time limit so much...

4083
02:58:37,880 --> 02:58:39,480
Like, it's so funny because...

4084
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:40,900
You can see...

4085
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:42,440
Where it's like...

4086
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:44,220
The line of darkness.

4087
02:58:46,620 --> 02:58:48,320
But they're also not showing you the clock.

4088
02:58:50,300 --> 02:58:51,120
But yeah...

4089
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:52,600
The Blue Archive anime is so cute!

4090
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:54,600
The opening is so cute!

4091
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:56,100
Oh, they're so cute!

4092
02:58:59,360 --> 02:59:00,780
It's super duper cute.

4093
02:59:02,340 --> 02:59:03,320
I'm just gonna put...

4094
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:03,820
At random.

4095
02:59:05,360 --> 02:59:06,620
This is so...

4096
02:59:07,220 --> 02:59:08,460
This is so...

4097
02:59:09,260 --> 02:59:09,900
Bizarre.

4098
02:59:10,940 --> 02:59:11,580
Oh!

4099
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:12,520
I did it!

4100
02:59:15,360 --> 02:59:16,960
It's not by nose color.

4101
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:19,580
Unless it's by nose color and...

4102
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:20,960
Something else.

4103
02:59:23,800 --> 02:59:24,440
Already?!

4104
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:26,140
Ma'am, I haven't even...

4105
02:59:33,400 --> 02:59:34,460
I'm closing the hotel for the night.

4106
02:59:34,500 --> 02:59:35,480
So scamper into a room.

4107
02:59:35,640 --> 02:59:37,620
Things have changed as the path has become more difficult.

4108
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:39,720
But the Zubinis have faith in you, brave explorer!

4109
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:42,600
You have all the information you need to complete this challenge!

4110
02:59:42,780 --> 02:59:43,740
And get your Zubinis through!

4111
02:59:44,200 --> 02:59:44,700
I do?

4112
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:48,880
I have all the information?

4113
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:50,760
Do I actually?

4114
02:59:53,700 --> 02:59:54,100
Ow!

4115
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:58,040
What about like you?

4116
02:59:59,200 --> 02:59:59,600
Ow!

4117
02:59:59,820 --> 02:59:59,880
Ow!

4118
03:00:06,530 --> 03:00:07,090
Okay.

4119
03:00:07,630 --> 03:00:08,410
Next one.

4120
03:00:08,570 --> 03:00:09,090
Let's see.

4121
03:00:09,210 --> 03:00:10,730
Oh, this one probably would be...

4122
03:00:15,850 --> 03:00:17,050
Wait, what is this?

4123
03:00:17,890 --> 03:00:20,690
Oh, the color of the star too?

4124
03:00:21,390 --> 03:00:21,490
Oh, the color of the star too?

4125
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:24,050
Oh!

4126
03:00:26,570 --> 03:00:27,130
Oh!

4127
03:00:27,190 --> 03:00:28,630
Wait, lucky us!

4128
03:00:28,830 --> 03:00:29,290
Oh!

4129
03:00:32,550 --> 03:00:32,910
Wait.

4130
03:00:32,990 --> 03:00:33,350
Wait.

4131
03:00:33,410 --> 03:00:33,730
No, no, no.

4132
03:00:36,810 --> 03:00:37,550
Oh my gosh.

4133
03:00:39,210 --> 03:00:40,110
Let's just try pink.

4134
03:00:42,710 --> 03:00:43,070
Let's just try pink.

4135
03:00:43,070 --> 03:00:43,730
This one's insane!

4136
03:00:44,870 --> 03:00:45,450
This one's insane!

4137
03:00:46,270 --> 03:00:48,570
Thanks for showing us your childhood game, Blue Archive Love!

4138
03:00:48,850 --> 03:00:48,950
Thanks for showing us your childhood game, Blue Archive Love!

4139
03:00:48,950 --> 03:00:49,090
Yes!

4140
03:00:49,670 --> 03:00:50,330
Oh my gosh!

4141
03:00:50,410 --> 03:00:51,270
Yeah, it was so cute!

4142
03:00:51,590 --> 03:00:55,290
It was really fun seeing some of the other characters.

4143
03:00:56,850 --> 03:00:59,270
Like the delinquent girls and things like that.

4144
03:00:59,290 --> 03:01:01,270
Them kind of in motion.

4145
03:01:01,450 --> 03:01:02,510
And everything.

4146
03:01:02,710 --> 03:01:03,810
It was fun.

4147
03:01:03,950 --> 03:01:04,710
It was really cute.

4148
03:01:06,590 --> 03:01:07,450
So what?

4149
03:01:07,870 --> 03:01:08,810
What is...

4150
03:01:13,350 --> 03:01:13,930
Okay.

4151
03:01:15,430 --> 03:01:16,590
The green...

4152
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:18,310
So it has to be...

4153
03:01:18,310 --> 03:01:19,290
Okay.

4154
03:01:19,690 --> 03:01:20,270
Wait.

4155
03:01:20,610 --> 03:01:21,810
It's gotta be green.

4156
03:01:21,990 --> 03:01:25,290
Because I think it corresponds to this grid.

4157
03:01:25,870 --> 03:01:26,450
Right?

4158
03:01:26,450 --> 03:01:29,350
The five by five.

4159
03:01:29,690 --> 03:01:30,570
And so...

4160
03:01:30,570 --> 03:01:32,010
It's the first one.

4161
03:01:32,570 --> 03:01:34,470
So it's gonna be star...

4162
03:01:34,470 --> 03:01:35,870
Maybe.

4163
03:01:39,470 --> 03:01:40,870
Let's try pink.

4164
03:01:41,130 --> 03:01:41,830
No, not pink.

4165
03:01:41,870 --> 03:01:42,150
Yellow.

4166
03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:45,470
Red.

4167
03:01:47,250 --> 03:01:47,950
No.

4168
03:01:58,720 --> 03:01:59,420
Blue.

4169
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:04,140
Oh, wait.

4170
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:04,360
Green.

4171
03:02:06,060 --> 03:02:07,020
Oh, wait.

4172
03:02:07,080 --> 03:02:08,840
I did the wrong one.

4173
03:02:10,100 --> 03:02:10,800
Green here.

4174
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:12,120
I'm silly.

4175
03:02:17,420 --> 03:02:17,900
Wait then.

4176
03:02:20,980 --> 03:02:22,460
What's on the third row?

4177
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:23,480
Wait.

4178
03:02:23,720 --> 03:02:26,300
But I was right about the first column being the green.

4179
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:28,600
It's just...

4180
03:02:29,440 --> 03:02:31,240
The classic splat dot wave.

4181
03:02:32,680 --> 03:02:33,800
The classic splat dot wave.

4182
03:02:33,800 --> 03:02:36,480
So it's correct about the green being here.

4183
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:37,340
And the blue is here.

4184
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:44,100
What determines it down here though?

4185
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:46,260
Is the question.

4186
03:02:47,160 --> 03:02:49,520
Is the big Q.

4187
03:02:49,720 --> 03:02:50,440
Is the big Q.

4188
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:50,800
Is the big Q.

4189
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:55,140
Try a different shape.

4190
03:02:55,240 --> 03:02:58,000
But then why would this shape go there?

4191
03:02:58,820 --> 03:03:01,280
But then why would this shape go there?

4192
03:03:01,280 --> 03:03:01,600
Wait.

4193
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:04,500
Are the shapes all wacky?

4194
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:05,460
Wackadoodle too?

4195
03:03:06,960 --> 03:03:10,020
I think they're different for each one.

4196
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:14,040
I think they're different for each one.

4197
03:03:14,040 --> 03:03:14,240
Oh my gosh.

4198
03:03:14,280 --> 03:03:14,660
We did it.

4199
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:19,260
Nice.

4200
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:24,180
I think they're different for each one.

4201
03:03:24,740 --> 03:03:26,680
I think they're different for each one.

4202
03:03:26,680 --> 03:03:28,320
Because if I did like a square here.

4203
03:03:28,520 --> 03:03:28,860
Because if I did like a square here.

4204
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:31,160
Would it go up there?

4205
03:03:31,280 --> 03:03:32,620
Let's test it out.

4206
03:03:33,520 --> 03:03:34,600
This is our...

4207
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:36,040
No.

4208
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:37,440
I can't be wasting ink.

4209
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:40,780
So this is a triangle down here.

4210
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:41,840
This too.

4211
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:43,820
Oh.

4212
03:03:43,860 --> 03:03:44,280
Not...

4213
03:03:46,880 --> 03:03:48,900
I was like don't go wasting ink.

4214
03:03:50,620 --> 03:03:51,140
Huh?

4215
03:03:53,860 --> 03:03:54,380
What?

4216
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:02,380
Oh yeah.

4217
03:04:02,440 --> 03:04:03,240
I completed it.

4218
03:04:03,360 --> 03:04:03,560
Yeah.

4219
03:04:04,680 --> 03:04:05,980
I completed it.

4220
03:04:06,060 --> 03:04:07,040
And I'm doing hard work.

4221
03:04:07,060 --> 03:04:07,620
Yeah.

4222
03:04:08,040 --> 03:04:09,620
I'm just testing out what the...

4223
03:04:14,750 --> 03:04:17,650
I think the shapes can't be in the same column.

4224
03:04:19,510 --> 03:04:21,110
Like what is the pattern here?

4225
03:04:21,410 --> 03:04:23,350
There's obviously the color which we got.

4226
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:27,470
Are they di...

4227
03:04:27,470 --> 03:04:27,930
No.

4228
03:04:27,990 --> 03:04:28,630
They're not diagonal.

4229
03:04:37,090 --> 03:04:39,250
It feels so random.

4230
03:04:39,570 --> 03:04:41,410
It feels so random.

4231
03:04:47,720 --> 03:04:51,420
So the one next to it can't be touching the same shape?

4232
03:04:51,560 --> 03:04:52,540
Is that what you guys are saying?

4233
03:04:55,340 --> 03:04:56,300
Like a sudoku?

4234
03:04:58,220 --> 03:04:58,840
Kind of?

4235
03:04:59,740 --> 03:05:00,540
Ink don't...

4236
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:01,360
What?

4237
03:05:02,140 --> 03:05:03,960
We ran out of ink so fast.

4238
03:05:04,020 --> 03:05:06,320
They don't even let you experiment a little.

4239
03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:07,400
No way.

4240
03:05:07,600 --> 03:05:07,940
Okay.

4241
03:05:07,980 --> 03:05:08,400
So pink.

4242
03:05:08,540 --> 03:05:09,780
Let's try and get this next three.

4243
03:05:11,140 --> 03:05:12,280
But how will I...

4244
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:20,000
I figured this game would only have like 10 games total.

4245
03:05:20,140 --> 03:05:21,280
I'm shocked that you're still playing it.

4246
03:05:21,320 --> 03:05:22,520
I'm going through stuff.

4247
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:23,780
I'm going through it.

4248
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:27,920
You have all the info you need.

4249
03:05:29,460 --> 03:05:29,900
Okay.

4250
03:05:29,960 --> 03:05:31,740
So maybe it's not a circle then.

4251
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:33,340
Thank

4252
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:52,420
you so much.

4253
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:53,120
Thank you.

4254
03:05:53,180 --> 03:05:53,380
Thank you.

4255
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:53,600
Thank you.

4256
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:56,120
And...

4257
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:56,400
Oh.

4258
03:05:56,520 --> 03:05:57,840
So it's gonna be...

4259
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Red is the only one.

4260
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:02,360
So close.

4261
03:06:02,460 --> 03:06:03,040
So close.

4262
03:06:03,060 --> 03:06:03,620
Oh my gosh.

4263
03:06:04,340 --> 03:06:05,200
Oh my gosh.

4264
03:06:06,260 --> 03:06:06,780
Square?

4265
03:06:07,600 --> 03:06:09,080
Why would it be square?

4266
03:06:15,890 --> 03:06:16,950
You were right though.

4267
03:06:17,050 --> 03:06:17,690
But why?

4268
03:06:19,270 --> 03:06:21,810
The shape is two to the right and one up.

4269
03:06:23,030 --> 03:06:23,550
Huh?

4270
03:06:24,830 --> 03:06:25,350
Huh?

4271
03:06:26,530 --> 03:06:27,050
Huh?

4272
03:06:28,050 --> 03:06:28,570
Huh?

4273
03:06:28,770 --> 03:06:29,870
I think we're out of ink.

4274
03:06:32,390 --> 03:06:34,090
Oh we get one more shot.

4275
03:06:34,290 --> 03:06:36,150
We could save two more maybe.

4276
03:06:38,410 --> 03:06:41,030
Let's do the green because we know this one.

4277
03:06:41,550 --> 03:06:42,710
Let's do the green because we know this one.

4278
03:06:42,810 --> 03:06:44,530
And it's uh...

4279
03:06:46,490 --> 03:06:47,850
Red inside.

4280
03:06:49,270 --> 03:06:50,330
And it's uh...

4281
03:06:50,330 --> 03:06:50,370
Ink is loading.

4282
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:52,410
Hold on.

4283
03:06:52,510 --> 03:06:53,670
Isn't there a thing for this?

4284
03:06:53,990 --> 03:06:54,130
Hold on.

4285
03:06:54,130 --> 03:06:54,130
Isn't there a thing for this?

4286
03:06:54,930 --> 03:06:55,950
One second.

4287
03:06:56,630 --> 03:06:59,090
I think there's a...

4288
03:07:06,510 --> 03:07:07,190
Uh...

4289
03:07:08,410 --> 03:07:08,750
Wait.

4290
03:07:10,430 --> 03:07:11,310
Yeah I got it.

4291
03:07:16,150 --> 03:07:16,750
This.

4292
03:07:20,550 --> 03:07:21,150
This.

4293
03:07:26,110 --> 03:07:27,010
It's triangle.

4294
03:07:33,380 --> 03:07:33,980
Green...

4295
03:07:35,660 --> 03:07:37,060
Yeah it's always gonna be...

4296
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:38,400
Green sphere, red triangle.

4297
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:39,940
Why is it triangle though?

4298
03:07:40,240 --> 03:07:41,780
How are you guys so good at this?

4299
03:07:43,540 --> 03:07:44,480
For this one?

4300
03:07:46,380 --> 03:07:48,260
We saved the final two.

4301
03:07:49,220 --> 03:07:49,900
We saved the final two.

4302
03:07:51,140 --> 03:07:52,680
No more ink left.

4303
03:07:52,900 --> 03:07:53,020
Yes.

4304
03:07:53,700 --> 03:07:55,180
Zoombinis were left behind.

4305
03:07:55,600 --> 03:07:57,540
But the knowledge was gained.

4306
03:07:58,240 --> 03:07:59,400
Press on.

4307
03:07:59,560 --> 03:08:00,880
Brave explorer.

4308
03:08:01,180 --> 03:08:02,060
Oh no.

4309
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:03,360
Yes.

4310
03:08:04,120 --> 03:08:06,240
Zoombinis were left behind.

4311
03:08:07,840 --> 03:08:09,160
Oh my gosh.

4312
03:08:09,240 --> 03:08:10,780
They encourage you to leave them.

4313
03:08:11,640 --> 03:08:12,680
What about this one?

4314
03:08:15,180 --> 03:08:16,540
Okay anyway.

4315
03:08:23,720 --> 03:08:25,380
This one actually looks kind of fun.

4316
03:08:25,560 --> 03:08:26,640
I'm not gonna lie.

4317
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:28,080
There's also...

4318
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:30,180
I remember there being another one up here.

4319
03:08:37,090 --> 03:08:38,030
What is this?

4320
03:08:40,330 --> 03:08:41,350
What does this do?

4321
03:08:41,510 --> 03:08:42,250
What are these?

4322
03:08:52,190 --> 03:08:52,710
Wait.

4323
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:58,160
Galaxy hole.

4324
03:08:58,840 --> 03:09:00,280
The music is like...

4325
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:00,920
Making more music.

4326
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:02,980
The music was not like this before.

4327
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:03,380
Was it?

4328
03:09:05,100 --> 03:09:06,180
This is new music.

4329
03:09:06,220 --> 03:09:07,460
I don't think I've ever heard this before.

4330
03:09:09,440 --> 03:09:10,160
Also how...

4331
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:12,000
Are you supposed to just go across?

4332
03:09:13,020 --> 03:09:14,000
Is that even possible?

4333
03:09:14,960 --> 03:09:16,080
I'm gonna send...

4334
03:09:16,620 --> 03:09:16,980
No.

4335
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:18,540
I'm not gonna send someone to their doom.

4336
03:09:19,220 --> 03:09:19,580
Wait.

4337
03:09:19,580 --> 03:09:20,660
Can I get you over there?

4338
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:21,440
Oh!

4339
03:09:23,260 --> 03:09:24,600
How do I get you over there?

4340
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:31,240
Did it play Robocop for a moment?

4341
03:09:31,880 --> 03:09:32,360
Did it play Robocop for a moment?

4342
03:09:32,940 --> 03:09:34,080
What's this thing on the left?

4343
03:09:34,180 --> 03:09:35,680
This is the thing that creates the bubbles.

4344
03:09:44,050 --> 03:09:44,890
What is the yellow...

4345
03:09:44,890 --> 03:09:45,030
Okay.

4346
03:09:45,070 --> 03:09:45,850
I'm gonna test this.

4347
03:09:45,950 --> 03:09:46,730
Cause I wanna know...

4348
03:09:49,150 --> 03:09:50,510
What the yellow and the...

4349
03:09:50,510 --> 03:09:51,330
What all this does.

4350
03:09:51,770 --> 03:09:53,070
I wanna know what the green does.

4351
03:09:53,210 --> 03:09:54,130
I wanna know what the yellow does.

4352
03:09:55,830 --> 03:09:56,330
Oh wait.

4353
03:09:56,390 --> 03:09:56,910
Maybe it...

4354
03:09:58,430 --> 03:09:58,810
Aha!

4355
03:09:58,810 --> 03:09:59,190
Aha!

4356
03:09:59,410 --> 03:10:00,010
It does.

4357
03:10:00,210 --> 03:10:00,450
Okay.

4358
03:10:00,510 --> 03:10:00,650
What's this?

4359
03:10:00,670 --> 03:10:01,190
What does the green do?

4360
03:10:07,290 --> 03:10:07,850
Huh?

4361
03:10:08,810 --> 03:10:09,750
Are you stuck?

4362
03:10:10,390 --> 03:10:11,070
Uh oh.

4363
03:10:12,250 --> 03:10:14,330
I think my Zoombini is trapped.

4364
03:10:18,010 --> 03:10:19,810
If I push her...

4365
03:10:19,810 --> 03:10:20,870
Oh!

4366
03:10:20,970 --> 03:10:21,650
Maybe I can like...

4367
03:10:21,650 --> 03:10:22,330
Push her over.

4368
03:10:24,790 --> 03:10:25,350
Maybe?

4369
03:10:30,930 --> 03:10:31,890
Let's send...

4370
03:10:33,710 --> 03:10:35,430
I feel like some of these...

4371
03:10:35,710 --> 03:10:37,010
I have to... when I do them...

4372
03:10:37,010 --> 03:10:38,410
It sends them to their doom.

4373
03:10:40,830 --> 03:10:42,530
Send another one?

4374
03:10:46,790 --> 03:10:47,850
Oh wait.

4375
03:10:48,050 --> 03:10:49,150
I think I just...

4376
03:10:49,660 --> 03:10:50,170
Uh oh.

4377
03:10:51,310 --> 03:10:52,010
Goodbye!

4378
03:10:56,520 --> 03:10:57,220
Sayounara!

4379
03:10:57,720 --> 03:10:59,780
Let's try... this way.

4380
03:11:09,130 --> 03:11:09,770
Look.

4381
03:11:09,870 --> 03:11:10,610
Now we're safe.

4382
03:11:12,030 --> 03:11:12,670
Yeah.

4383
03:11:16,060 --> 03:11:16,960
Here we go.

4384
03:11:19,720 --> 03:11:20,360
Push.

4385
03:11:20,940 --> 03:11:21,760
Push her.

4386
03:11:21,860 --> 03:11:22,220
Push.

4387
03:11:22,280 --> 03:11:22,580
Push.

4388
03:11:23,100 --> 03:11:23,740
Zoombinis.

4389
03:11:25,800 --> 03:11:26,440
Oh!

4390
03:11:27,900 --> 03:11:29,540
You murdered her!

4391
03:11:31,100 --> 03:11:32,860
You murdered her!

4392
03:11:32,900 --> 03:11:33,380
You murderer!

4393
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:35,620
You!

4394
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:36,860
You killed her!

4395
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:38,920
You killed her!

4396
03:11:50,050 --> 03:11:52,310
I cannot believe...

4397
03:11:53,010 --> 03:11:53,410
The...

4398
03:11:54,290 --> 03:11:55,370
This is...

4399
03:11:56,230 --> 03:11:57,590
I'm disgusted.

4400
03:11:57,770 --> 03:12:00,430
I'm disgusted in this display right now.

4401
03:12:00,610 --> 03:12:02,190
I can't even... I can't even...

4402
03:12:02,190 --> 03:12:05,790
I can't... I cannot even deal with these Zoombinis any longer.

4403
03:12:06,030 --> 03:12:06,490
Hold on.

4404
03:12:06,550 --> 03:12:07,190
I wanna see this one.

4405
03:12:08,210 --> 03:12:08,890
Huh?

4406
03:12:10,690 --> 03:12:12,570
It doesn't tell you.

4407
03:12:15,410 --> 03:12:16,610
It doesn't tell you.

4408
03:12:16,610 --> 03:12:17,250
It just says...

4409
03:12:17,250 --> 03:12:18,670
You figure it out.

4410
03:12:19,350 --> 03:12:20,870
That's very hard mode.

4411
03:12:21,070 --> 03:12:22,550
It just doesn't tell you.

4412
03:12:22,650 --> 03:12:23,810
That is so funny.

4413
03:12:27,330 --> 03:12:28,170
Thank you!

4414
03:12:29,450 --> 03:12:32,990
Where do the Zoombinis go when they get accidentally...

4415
03:12:32,990 --> 03:12:34,330
They go back to camp.

4416
03:12:34,330 --> 03:12:35,010
It's fine.

4417
03:12:35,150 --> 03:12:35,650
They're fine.

4418
03:12:40,290 --> 03:12:41,850
I like the music in that one.

4419
03:12:41,930 --> 03:12:42,890
What one haven't we seen?

4420
03:12:43,330 --> 03:12:43,990
This one?

4421
03:12:44,210 --> 03:12:46,030
I think it's probably the same as...

4422
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:47,650
Like the...

4423
03:12:48,890 --> 03:12:49,830
The bridge.

4424
03:12:51,470 --> 03:12:53,210
I think we've seen everything else.

4425
03:12:54,490 --> 03:12:55,210
Very cool.

4426
03:13:03,060 --> 03:13:03,760
Very cool.

4427
03:13:04,480 --> 03:13:06,040
They go to the shadow realm.

4428
03:13:07,180 --> 03:13:07,660
Crystal?

4429
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:09,180
We did the crystal one too.

4430
03:13:11,780 --> 03:13:12,540
Yeah.

4431
03:13:16,040 --> 03:13:17,740
That was fun.

4432
03:13:18,420 --> 03:13:20,280
What a blast from the past.

4433
03:13:22,240 --> 03:13:23,180
Hold on.

4434
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:26,160
Bing bing bing.

4435
03:13:26,520 --> 03:13:27,640
Bing bing bing bing.

4436
03:13:27,740 --> 03:13:29,560
I am going to...

4437
03:13:30,800 --> 03:13:31,840
Go here.

4438
03:13:32,380 --> 03:13:33,140
Hello.

4439
03:13:33,580 --> 03:13:34,340
Hello.

4440
03:13:34,340 --> 03:13:34,420
Hello.

4441
03:13:40,120 --> 03:13:41,760
I am too slow.

4442
03:13:49,720 --> 03:13:50,360
Ouch!

4443
03:13:51,220 --> 03:13:52,040
Stop it!

4444
03:13:54,240 --> 03:13:56,600
Let me close out of Zoombinis real quick.

4445
03:13:56,720 --> 03:13:57,940
Let me put on some BGM.

4446
03:13:58,760 --> 03:13:59,400
And...

4447
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:02,520
Give me a second.

4448
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:04,240
BGM.

4449
03:14:04,860 --> 03:14:05,500
BGM.

4450
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:07,300
BGM.

4451
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:09,400
BGM.

4452
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:11,660
BGM.

4453
03:14:12,760 --> 03:14:13,520
BGM.

4454
03:14:22,070 --> 03:14:22,810
Hold on.

4455
03:14:22,930 --> 03:14:24,270
I have to make sure it's...

4456
03:14:25,890 --> 03:14:26,990
There we go.

4457
03:14:33,040 --> 03:14:34,840
Thank you guys.

4458
03:14:35,960 --> 03:14:36,340
For...

4459
03:14:38,140 --> 03:14:38,900
For...

4460
03:14:40,100 --> 03:14:42,340
Whatever that brain...

4461
03:14:42,340 --> 03:14:43,420
Battle.

4462
03:14:43,920 --> 03:14:45,060
Battle of the wits.

4463
03:14:46,220 --> 03:14:46,620
Open here.

4464
03:14:50,520 --> 03:14:51,960
That was so fun.

4465
03:14:52,220 --> 03:14:52,920
Oh my gosh.

4466
03:14:54,780 --> 03:14:55,960
That was so much fun.

4467
03:14:58,800 --> 03:14:59,780
It was awesome.

4468
03:15:00,220 --> 03:15:00,980
Revisiting that.

4469
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:01,620
For sure.

4470
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:08,980
My brain hurts.

4471
03:15:09,360 --> 03:15:10,380
From some of those.

4472
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:13,420
I didn't expect the very very hard...

4473
03:15:13,420 --> 03:15:14,780
To be as difficult as it was.

4474
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:17,720
I surpassed my expectations.

4475
03:15:18,140 --> 03:15:18,740
Entirely.

4476
03:15:20,180 --> 03:15:22,180
Good job showing off your mighty brain cell.

4477
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:24,240
Thank you.

4478
03:15:24,660 --> 03:15:25,420
Thank you.

4479
03:15:25,980 --> 03:15:26,720
I know.

4480
03:15:26,780 --> 03:15:27,780
You might be intimidated.

4481
03:15:28,180 --> 03:15:29,620
You might be intimidated.

4482
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:30,780
By how...

4483
03:15:31,720 --> 03:15:32,320
Well.

4484
03:15:33,580 --> 03:15:35,480
I was able to perceive things.

4485
03:15:36,120 --> 03:15:37,160
But you too.

4486
03:15:38,120 --> 03:15:38,720
Can...

4487
03:15:41,940 --> 03:15:43,820
Can become my level.

4488
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:44,960
At some point.

4489
03:15:45,140 --> 03:15:46,120
Thanks for streaming.

4490
03:15:46,220 --> 03:15:46,440
Mint.

4491
03:15:46,540 --> 03:15:47,300
Thank you.

4492
03:15:47,400 --> 03:15:48,200
Thanks for the stream.

4493
03:15:48,240 --> 03:15:48,580
Thank you.

4494
03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:50,080
I will be reading donations out.

4495
03:15:50,440 --> 03:15:52,000
So if you're gonna head out.

4496
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:54,400
See you later.

4497
03:15:56,080 --> 03:15:57,260
Tomorrow I have off.

4498
03:15:58,260 --> 03:15:59,220
Because the podcast.

4499
03:15:59,800 --> 03:16:01,760
Will be released.

4500
03:16:02,600 --> 03:16:03,060
So.

4501
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:05,300
Yeah.

4502
03:16:06,540 --> 03:16:07,000
And...

4503
03:16:10,160 --> 03:16:11,080
Podcast Mondays.

4504
03:16:11,760 --> 03:16:12,220
Yippee.

4505
03:16:14,220 --> 03:16:14,700
Yippee.

4506
03:16:14,780 --> 03:16:15,000
Yippee.

4507
03:16:17,540 --> 03:16:18,020
Umm...

4508
03:16:18,020 --> 03:16:18,620
Yeah.

4509
03:16:21,740 --> 03:16:23,640
That really made me want pizza.

4510
03:16:23,800 --> 03:16:24,460
More than anything.

4511
03:16:25,880 --> 03:16:26,480
Thank you.

4512
03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:26,920
Thank you.

4513
03:16:28,720 --> 03:16:29,980
I'm buying this game now.

4514
03:16:30,020 --> 03:16:31,500
Completely missed it way back when.

4515
03:16:31,540 --> 03:16:32,700
Thanks for the stream, Minty.

4516
03:16:33,180 --> 03:16:34,040
Of course.

4517
03:16:35,860 --> 03:16:36,820
Of course.

4518
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,900
There's gonna be an uptick in Zumbini sales.

4519
03:16:40,020 --> 03:16:40,300
Maybe.

4520
03:16:40,400 --> 03:16:41,580
It is very fun though.

4521
03:16:42,660 --> 03:16:43,480
And it's...

4522
03:16:43,480 --> 03:16:44,220
I didn't realize.

4523
03:16:44,280 --> 03:16:45,020
I never noticed.

4524
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:47,320
That on the map.

4525
03:16:47,360 --> 03:16:50,600
It showed like how many Zumbinis were left on Zumbini Isle.

4526
03:16:50,840 --> 03:16:51,360
Yeah.

4527
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:52,460
Zumbini Island, right?

4528
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:54,520
And then you move them to...

4529
03:16:54,520 --> 03:16:55,420
No.

4530
03:16:57,800 --> 03:16:58,840
Zumbini Island...

4531
03:16:58,840 --> 03:16:59,240
Wait.

4532
03:16:59,300 --> 03:17:01,680
Zumbini Isle is the new one, right?

4533
03:17:02,780 --> 03:17:04,000
Zumbini Pachinko Machine.

4534
03:17:04,320 --> 03:17:05,340
I hope never.

4535
03:17:08,360 --> 03:17:08,720
Yeah.

4536
03:17:12,160 --> 03:17:13,900
Zumbini Island to Zumbini Ville.

4537
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:14,400
That's right.

4538
03:17:14,580 --> 03:17:16,900
Zumbini Island to Zumbini Ville.

4539
03:17:17,800 --> 03:17:18,380
That's right.

4540
03:17:18,400 --> 03:17:18,780
That's right.

4541
03:17:18,800 --> 03:17:19,140
That's right.

4542
03:17:21,400 --> 03:17:21,760
Yeah.

4543
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:22,060
Yeah.

4544
03:17:22,140 --> 03:17:22,260
Yeah.

4545
03:17:23,160 --> 03:17:23,520
So...

4546
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:26,720
What happens when you get all to the island?

4547
03:17:26,820 --> 03:17:27,900
I have no idea because...

4548
03:17:27,900 --> 03:17:30,420
I think as a kid I never noticed that there was an amount.

4549
03:17:31,560 --> 03:17:32,660
But I always just...

4550
03:17:33,260 --> 03:17:33,680
Played it.

4551
03:17:34,220 --> 03:17:35,000
I don't even know.

4552
03:17:35,340 --> 03:17:37,740
I think that's a new addition from the original game.

4553
03:17:38,140 --> 03:17:38,820
Who knows.

4554
03:17:39,300 --> 03:17:41,360
But as a kid I just never noticed it.

4555
03:17:42,060 --> 03:17:42,460
Yeah.

4556
03:17:43,180 --> 03:17:45,180
I got to squeeze in a run to this stream.

4557
03:17:45,300 --> 03:17:45,640
Thanks.

4558
03:17:45,980 --> 03:17:46,760
No problem.

4559
03:17:49,920 --> 03:17:51,660
Let's get this off my head.

4560
03:17:51,820 --> 03:17:52,280
Good bye.

4561
03:17:53,560 --> 03:17:54,160
Good bye.

4562
03:17:54,200 --> 03:17:54,400
Good bye.

4563
03:17:55,100 --> 03:17:55,500
Here.

4564
03:17:55,580 --> 03:17:56,820
Let's put something else on my head.

4565
03:17:58,120 --> 03:17:58,520
Um...

4566
03:18:00,340 --> 03:18:00,740
Um...

4567
03:18:03,860 --> 03:18:04,260
Um...

4568
03:18:05,600 --> 03:18:06,540
This is me.

4569
03:18:08,940 --> 03:18:09,680
I'm bread.

4570
03:18:12,120 --> 03:18:12,900
I'm bread.

4571
03:18:16,140 --> 03:18:16,620
I'm bread.

4572
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:17,580
Because I'm brain dead.

4573
03:18:17,860 --> 03:18:18,040
Because I'm brain dead.

4574
03:18:18,040 --> 03:18:18,560
You're a soup.

4575
03:18:19,020 --> 03:18:20,180
You're a soup.

4576
03:18:20,580 --> 03:18:21,220
Thank you.

4577
03:18:21,740 --> 03:18:22,700
Thanks for the fun stream.

4578
03:18:22,760 --> 03:18:23,600
Go see my friends.

4579
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:26,940
Who doesn't watch VTubers but love Zumbini's was watching.

4580
03:18:27,140 --> 03:18:27,980
And had a blast.

4581
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:30,540
As for those we lost, we won't see them.

4582
03:18:30,660 --> 03:18:31,560
And as ashes.

4583
03:18:31,560 --> 03:18:33,280
They're all diamonds.

4584
03:18:33,580 --> 03:18:34,900
They are diamonds.

4585
03:18:34,900 --> 03:18:36,080
Zumbini is so true.

4586
03:18:37,840 --> 03:18:40,540
I hope this becomes the next flavor of the month streamer game.

4587
03:18:40,600 --> 03:18:42,600
So VTubers everywhere can show the world what they are.

4588
03:18:42,760 --> 03:18:46,340
That they are not in fact smarter than a first grader.

4589
03:18:46,780 --> 03:18:47,300
That they are not in fact smarter than a first grader.

4590
03:18:47,300 --> 03:18:47,320
That they are not in fact smarter than a first grader.

4591
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:47,360
Hey!

4592
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:50,380
I proved myself.

4593
03:18:52,380 --> 03:18:54,460
I proved myself pretty well I think.

4594
03:18:55,460 --> 03:18:56,280
I proved myself pretty well I think.

4595
03:18:56,340 --> 03:18:58,980
Now that the Microsoft cops can't stop us.

4596
03:18:59,020 --> 03:19:01,500
Now that the Microsoft cops can't stop us.

4597
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:02,040
I'm going to be a flight sim.

4598
03:19:02,200 --> 03:19:03,940
Oh my gosh.

4599
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:05,460
It's so crazy you bring that up.

4600
03:19:05,540 --> 03:19:06,680
Because I was watching something yesterday.

4601
03:19:06,880 --> 03:19:08,260
And they brought up flight simulator.

4602
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:10,580
And I was like, I can do that.

4603
03:19:12,580 --> 03:19:14,560
So, 12 hour stream baby.

4604
03:19:14,800 --> 03:19:16,300
Let's fly to Japan.

4605
03:19:19,340 --> 03:19:20,380
We can fly.

4606
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:21,980
We can fly.

4607
03:19:22,160 --> 03:19:22,940
We can fly.

4608
03:19:23,020 --> 03:19:24,500
We can fly.

4609
03:19:25,620 --> 03:19:27,560
I've always wanted to do that.

4610
03:19:29,240 --> 03:19:29,720
So...

4611
03:19:31,500 --> 03:19:31,680
It's funny.

4612
03:19:33,640 --> 03:19:35,940
Maybe I should have done it.

4613
03:19:37,280 --> 03:19:40,040
Back when I streamed 3 years ago.

4614
03:19:40,380 --> 03:19:40,620
But...

4615
03:19:42,280 --> 03:19:43,100
Oh well.

4616
03:19:43,540 --> 03:19:45,320
How... I do wonder though.

4617
03:19:45,860 --> 03:19:47,580
Like how much do I...

4618
03:19:47,580 --> 03:19:49,600
Need to know...

4619
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:51,160
Of flying a plane.

4620
03:19:51,740 --> 03:19:52,780
To do it.

4621
03:19:53,080 --> 03:19:56,980
I actually have looked into getting a pilot's license before.

4622
03:19:57,700 --> 03:19:58,300
But...

4623
03:19:58,300 --> 03:19:59,620
Oh my gosh.

4624
03:20:01,500 --> 03:20:03,360
A pilot's license is actually insane.

4625
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:04,920
Not that I have a plane to fly anyway.

4626
03:20:05,640 --> 03:20:05,980
But...

4627
03:20:07,420 --> 03:20:07,900
My...

4628
03:20:08,600 --> 03:20:09,080
My...

4629
03:20:10,380 --> 03:20:11,980
One of my old bosses...

4630
03:20:13,720 --> 03:20:14,680
Had a...

4631
03:20:14,680 --> 03:20:16,880
A pilot's license.

4632
03:20:17,240 --> 03:20:18,200
And so...

4633
03:20:19,400 --> 03:20:20,300
I don't know.

4634
03:20:20,360 --> 03:20:22,560
Maybe I should ask him.

4635
03:20:23,480 --> 03:20:25,140
Hey, can you teach me how to fly?

4636
03:20:27,620 --> 03:20:30,700
It was a semi-popular thing to do in my uni.

4637
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:33,340
What do you go to a uni of...

4638
03:20:33,340 --> 03:20:35,180
People like...

4639
03:20:35,180 --> 03:20:36,860
Who sleep on gold?

4640
03:20:38,380 --> 03:20:41,140
Getting a pilot's license is so expensive.

4641
03:20:41,980 --> 03:20:43,100
Getting a pilot's license is so expensive.

4642
03:20:43,100 --> 03:20:43,120
Getting a pilot's license is so expensive.

4643
03:20:43,800 --> 03:20:45,040
I just wanna...

4644
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:45,400
You know...

4645
03:20:45,400 --> 03:20:47,020
As a ghost, I can fly anyway.

4646
03:20:47,300 --> 03:20:48,960
But I just kinda wanna look...

4647
03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:52,380
Fly is like a...

4648
03:20:52,380 --> 03:20:53,240
I can float.

4649
03:20:54,400 --> 03:20:55,700
Fly is like a...

4650
03:20:56,260 --> 03:20:56,980
Big word.

4651
03:20:58,560 --> 03:20:59,160
But...

4652
03:21:00,520 --> 03:21:02,220
Pilot's license for small planes...

4653
03:21:02,220 --> 03:21:03,480
Is easy and not that bad.

4654
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:05,520
Okay, I'm gonna say...

4655
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:07,740
The price that I saw...

4656
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:10,440
And...

4657
03:21:10,440 --> 03:21:12,380
Anyone who wants to confirm...

4658
03:21:12,380 --> 03:21:12,780
Can confirm.

4659
03:21:15,400 --> 03:21:16,440
I saw...

4660
03:21:16,440 --> 03:21:17,260
It was for...

4661
03:21:17,260 --> 03:21:20,040
10,000 US dollars.

4662
03:21:22,640 --> 03:21:23,520
Is that correct?

4663
03:21:23,980 --> 03:21:24,400
Is that correct?

4664
03:21:24,400 --> 03:21:25,220
Oh, I heard about 10k.

4665
03:21:25,440 --> 03:21:25,860
See?

4666
03:21:26,060 --> 03:21:26,280
See?

4667
03:21:26,420 --> 03:21:27,260
That's what I heard.

4668
03:21:27,420 --> 03:21:29,260
That's what I googled and it told me.

4669
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:30,440
I googled it.

4670
03:21:30,520 --> 03:21:31,340
Yeah, that's about right.

4671
03:21:31,720 --> 03:21:32,640
Oh my god.

4672
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:35,880
10k is low?

4673
03:21:36,480 --> 03:21:37,660
Oh my god, we got...

4674
03:21:38,120 --> 03:21:39,400
Mr. Morbucks over here.

4675
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:46,560
Commercial is like...

4676
03:21:47,480 --> 03:21:47,900
150k?

4677
03:21:57,650 --> 03:22:00,410
10k is low for a pilot's license though.

4678
03:22:00,490 --> 03:22:00,670
10k is low for a pilot's license though.

4679
03:22:00,670 --> 03:22:00,690
Okay.

4680
03:22:01,410 --> 03:22:04,710
It's like 7 MGS3 Pachi slot machines.

4681
03:22:05,610 --> 03:22:06,090
It's like 7 MGS3 Pachi slot machines.

4682
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:08,130
Sheesh.

4683
03:22:11,030 --> 03:22:12,750
Do pilots make good money?

4684
03:22:12,990 --> 03:22:15,010
Like, say if I were a pilot for...

4685
03:22:15,010 --> 03:22:16,790
Some big company?

4686
03:22:17,010 --> 03:22:18,150
Do they make...

4687
03:22:18,150 --> 03:22:20,630
The fact that you have to pay 150...

4688
03:22:21,490 --> 03:22:22,370
Thousand dollars?

4689
03:22:24,050 --> 03:22:24,650
I

4690
03:22:27,740 --> 03:22:28,160
mean...

4691
03:22:28,160 --> 03:22:28,740
Okay.

4692
03:22:30,060 --> 03:22:31,680
When I think about it...

4693
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:32,960
Okay, hold on.

4694
03:22:33,280 --> 03:22:35,740
That doesn't include school, right?

4695
03:22:36,720 --> 03:22:37,400
Because...

4696
03:22:38,200 --> 03:22:38,880
Some...

4697
03:22:38,880 --> 03:22:41,560
Some colleges in the United States...

4698
03:22:42,020 --> 03:22:43,580
Cost that much...

4699
03:22:43,580 --> 03:22:45,300
Intuition and things like that.

4700
03:22:45,840 --> 03:22:46,520
So...

4701
03:22:51,410 --> 03:22:53,370
It doesn't include school.

4702
03:22:53,650 --> 03:22:55,010
It's just like the...

4703
03:22:55,010 --> 03:22:55,930
The test.

4704
03:22:58,230 --> 03:22:59,410
That's so crazy.

4705
03:23:00,570 --> 03:23:01,250
That's so crazy.

4706
03:23:02,090 --> 03:23:03,330
That's so crazy.

4707
03:23:03,630 --> 03:23:06,170
Not that I would get the commercial license anyway.

4708
03:23:07,730 --> 03:23:08,330
But...

4709
03:23:09,190 --> 03:23:09,490
But...

4710
03:23:11,330 --> 03:23:12,130
But actually...

4711
03:23:12,130 --> 03:23:12,750
I don't know.

4712
03:23:12,930 --> 03:23:13,670
Like, what...

4713
03:23:16,170 --> 03:23:16,770
How...

4714
03:23:16,770 --> 03:23:18,970
How commercial are we talking?

4715
03:23:19,250 --> 03:23:20,230
Because if I...

4716
03:23:22,030 --> 03:23:23,330
If I'm just like...

4717
03:23:23,330 --> 03:23:25,010
Hey guys, I have a plane...

4718
03:23:25,010 --> 03:23:27,650
But I need you to pay...

4719
03:23:28,290 --> 03:23:29,770
For my time...

4720
03:23:29,770 --> 03:23:30,450
For my time...

4721
03:23:32,110 --> 03:23:33,370
Is that commercial?

4722
03:23:33,830 --> 03:23:34,330
I mean...

4723
03:23:34,330 --> 03:23:37,110
If I don't have a business...

4724
03:23:37,110 --> 03:23:38,710
If I'm just sometimes like...

4725
03:23:38,710 --> 03:23:40,790
Oh, and you can tell your friends...

4726
03:23:40,790 --> 03:23:42,090
That I have a plane...

4727
03:23:42,090 --> 03:23:43,910
But I'm gonna charge them a little bit more...

4728
03:23:43,910 --> 03:23:45,190
Because they're not my friends.

4729
03:23:45,550 --> 03:23:46,150
You know?

4730
03:23:50,250 --> 03:23:51,630
Getting the 747...

4731
03:23:51,630 --> 03:23:57,470
You guys, I'm gonna fly a Boeing.

4732
03:23:58,010 --> 03:23:58,490
Pfft...

4733
03:23:58,490 --> 03:23:58,670
Pfft...

4734
03:24:01,230 --> 03:24:01,830
Okay.

4735
03:24:02,050 --> 03:24:03,330
Next stream idea.

4736
03:24:04,030 --> 03:24:04,630
Pfft...

4737
03:24:11,680 --> 03:24:13,440
If I'm going down...

4738
03:24:13,440 --> 03:24:14,600
I'm taking you all with me.

4739
03:24:14,880 --> 03:24:15,460
Pfft...

4740
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:18,560
Boeing hand cam.

4741
03:24:22,870 --> 03:24:24,590
I'm not ready to die yet.

4742
03:24:25,830 --> 03:24:26,590
It's okay.

4743
03:24:26,810 --> 03:24:27,370
You're wisps.

4744
03:24:27,470 --> 03:24:28,070
You're wisps.

4745
03:24:28,290 --> 03:24:28,890
Pfft...

4746
03:24:30,150 --> 03:24:30,890
You're wisps.

4747
03:24:30,970 --> 03:24:31,590
You're wisps.

4748
03:24:32,890 --> 03:24:33,490
Pspsps...

4749
03:24:33,490 --> 03:24:34,350
Pfft...

4750
03:24:36,410 --> 03:24:36,990
Oh...

4751
03:24:36,990 --> 03:24:39,810
It's so scary that I have to check every time now.

4752
03:24:39,990 --> 03:24:42,130
When I'm like getting a flight...

4753
03:24:42,130 --> 03:24:43,070
I'm just like...

4754
03:24:43,070 --> 03:24:43,690
This is...

4755
03:24:43,690 --> 03:24:45,210
This is...

4756
03:24:45,210 --> 03:24:49,290
I don't wanna have anxiety the entire flight.

4757
03:24:49,490 --> 03:24:50,030
You know what I mean?

4758
03:24:52,530 --> 03:24:53,410
Worth it.

4759
03:24:54,450 --> 03:24:56,190
Crash landing on a desert...

4760
03:24:56,190 --> 03:24:57,570
Deserted island stream.

4761
03:25:02,330 --> 03:25:03,490
Rest in pieces.

4762
03:25:04,130 --> 03:25:04,730
Pfft...

4763
03:25:06,870 --> 03:25:07,350
Oh...

4764
03:25:07,350 --> 03:25:08,670
Sorry, Mint.

4765
03:25:08,750 --> 03:25:12,150
I want my pilot to be able to recognize their subvenius names.

4766
03:25:12,310 --> 03:25:14,710
I don't think I could even become a pilot anyway because...

4767
03:25:14,710 --> 03:25:16,770
You have to have like good vision, right?

4768
03:25:17,810 --> 03:25:19,450
Unfortunately, I wear contacts.

4769
03:25:20,730 --> 03:25:21,830
Even as a ghost.

4770
03:25:22,250 --> 03:25:22,730
Even as a ghost.

4771
03:25:22,730 --> 03:25:23,210
You're thinking...

4772
03:25:23,210 --> 03:25:26,550
Even in death, my vision would be better.

4773
03:25:30,510 --> 03:25:31,330
Oh, it's a myth.

4774
03:25:35,610 --> 03:25:37,170
Did you guys know that...

4775
03:25:37,170 --> 03:25:37,870
Actually...

4776
03:25:38,930 --> 03:25:40,810
I don't know if this is only Delta.

4777
03:25:42,210 --> 03:25:43,710
I saw videos on it.

4778
03:25:43,790 --> 03:25:46,230
But I think everyone that I saw with the videos did Delta.

4779
03:25:46,770 --> 03:25:47,690
But um...

4780
03:25:47,690 --> 03:25:51,230
Some pilots have trading cards.

4781
03:25:52,430 --> 03:25:53,390
Of their...

4782
03:25:53,390 --> 03:25:54,650
Of the plane.

4783
03:25:56,530 --> 03:25:57,970
So if you're just like...

4784
03:25:57,970 --> 03:25:59,230
Hi, can I talk to the pilot?

4785
03:25:59,810 --> 03:26:02,430
And you can collect cards of the planes.

4786
03:26:02,750 --> 03:26:04,050
Isn't that so awesome?

4787
03:26:04,270 --> 03:26:07,430
I wanted to do it last time but I was really...

4788
03:26:07,430 --> 03:26:08,430
I was like...

4789
03:26:09,170 --> 03:26:10,350
What if they were like...

4790
03:26:10,350 --> 03:26:11,810
What the hell are you talking about?

4791
03:26:11,950 --> 03:26:14,290
I was nervous to ask.

4792
03:26:15,730 --> 03:26:16,370
Wait, really?

4793
03:26:16,450 --> 03:26:17,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4794
03:26:17,570 --> 03:26:18,070
Look it up.

4795
03:26:19,250 --> 03:26:20,150
It's so cool.

4796
03:26:21,990 --> 03:26:24,350
I don't know if it's just Delta though.

4797
03:26:28,390 --> 03:26:29,270
But um...

4798
03:26:29,270 --> 03:26:31,670
Every time I've watched a video about it...

4799
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:33,330
The pilots are so nice.

4800
03:26:33,810 --> 03:26:35,910
But I think because it went viral on TikTok...

4801
03:26:35,910 --> 03:26:38,730
A lot of people have been asking and so the pilots will be like...

4802
03:26:38,730 --> 03:26:40,010
The pilots will be like...

4803
03:26:40,010 --> 03:26:40,630
Oh, I'm out.

4804
03:26:40,830 --> 03:26:43,470
People keep asking for these all of the sudden.

4805
03:26:48,510 --> 03:26:49,430
Sorry, Minto.

4806
03:26:49,530 --> 03:26:52,090
If I hear this is your captain speaking and it's your voice...

4807
03:26:52,090 --> 03:26:55,210
I'm jumping out right there and then...

4808
03:26:55,970 --> 03:26:58,430
This is your captain speaking.

4809
03:26:59,010 --> 03:27:02,010
The local temperature is...

4810
03:27:02,010 --> 03:27:02,810
The local temperature is...

4811
03:27:08,230 --> 03:27:12,270
You need a sweater, but a really light sweater.

4812
03:27:12,610 --> 03:27:12,850
You need a sweater, but a really light sweater.

4813
03:27:12,850 --> 03:27:13,170
You know?

4814
03:27:14,750 --> 03:27:19,690
And we're coming in at an altitude of craziness.

4815
03:27:19,770 --> 03:27:19,850
And we're coming in at an altitude of craziness.

4816
03:27:20,810 --> 03:27:21,790
Buckle up, baby!

4817
03:27:22,090 --> 03:27:22,590
Wooooo!

4818
03:27:28,040 --> 03:27:30,100
Have you seen that furry who's a technician?

4819
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:31,820
And writes oh whoa on the fuel tank?

4820
03:27:32,060 --> 03:27:33,380
I have seen that.

4821
03:27:33,520 --> 03:27:34,120
I have seen it.

4822
03:27:34,140 --> 03:27:34,660
I have seen that.

4823
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:35,480
It's so crazy.

4824
03:27:38,200 --> 03:27:39,120
So funny.

4825
03:27:41,240 --> 03:27:42,680
Buckle up, whisperers.

4826
03:27:45,380 --> 03:27:46,620
We're going shopping.

4827
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:50,820
What happens if you LASIK a ghost?

4828
03:27:50,960 --> 03:27:52,440
I will never get LASIK.

4829
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:55,620
So, I don't know.

4830
03:27:57,980 --> 03:27:59,520
Do they just go straight through?

4831
03:27:59,640 --> 03:28:01,300
There's so many mysteries about ghosts.

4832
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:05,340
So many.

4833
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:06,960
Oh, I just went to...

4834
03:28:06,960 --> 03:28:07,760
That's funny.

4835
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:08,480
I went to YouTube.

4836
03:28:08,600 --> 03:28:10,920
Because I was like, time to read Super Chats.

4837
03:28:11,100 --> 03:28:12,500
I don't have Super Chats.

4838
03:28:14,460 --> 03:28:15,360
Can I...

4839
03:28:16,740 --> 03:28:17,900
I don't even...

4840
03:28:21,220 --> 03:28:22,240
Yeah, I'll show...

4841
03:28:24,060 --> 03:28:27,980
I'm almost halfway to the amount of hours that I need...

4842
03:28:28,760 --> 03:28:29,800
to get...

4843
03:28:31,160 --> 03:28:31,680
monetization.

4844
03:28:32,640 --> 03:28:33,620
So, we'll see.

4845
03:28:34,140 --> 03:28:34,300
I don't know.

4846
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:37,420
I'm not gonna worry about it, though.

4847
03:28:38,720 --> 03:28:40,520
I'm not too concerned, to be honest.

4848
03:28:41,880 --> 03:28:42,820
Force of habit.

4849
03:28:47,020 --> 03:28:48,080
Are they gonna...

4850
03:28:48,080 --> 03:28:50,140
I'll get LASIK if they...

4851
03:28:50,140 --> 03:28:51,220
What's the word?

4852
03:28:51,380 --> 03:28:53,380
They put Sharingan in my eyes.

4853
03:29:00,540 --> 03:29:03,960
How long do you have to be inactive for where it resets?

4854
03:29:04,140 --> 03:29:04,520
I don't know.

4855
03:29:04,580 --> 03:29:05,700
It was a long time.

4856
03:29:08,420 --> 03:29:09,800
I can't remember, though.

4857
03:29:11,500 --> 03:29:13,240
Maybe several months.

4858
03:29:13,940 --> 03:29:15,220
Three months or something.

4859
03:29:17,660 --> 03:29:18,420
I don't know.

4860
03:29:20,680 --> 03:29:22,600
I don't think I have the emails anymore.

4861
03:29:22,800 --> 03:29:25,920
Where it's just like, Hey, you're gonna not have membership...

4862
03:29:25,920 --> 03:29:27,920
You're gonna not have monetization anymore.

4863
03:29:29,640 --> 03:29:32,180
Oh, I don't have a thing that says Dono reading.

4864
03:29:32,420 --> 03:29:32,840
Hold on.

4865
03:29:33,500 --> 03:29:34,420
Um...

4866
03:29:35,360 --> 03:29:35,820
Text.

4867
03:29:42,080 --> 03:29:43,960
Donation reading time.

4868
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:46,360
Thank you.

4869
03:29:47,720 --> 03:29:48,780
Let's see.

4870
03:29:49,020 --> 03:29:50,520
I need a font.

4871
03:29:52,860 --> 03:29:53,780
Uh...

4872
03:29:55,780 --> 03:29:56,700
Uh...

4873
03:29:58,440 --> 03:29:59,360
Oh...

4874
03:29:59,360 --> 03:30:00,120
Beep.

4875
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:03,000
I don't know.

4876
03:30:03,240 --> 03:30:04,580
Let's outline it.

4877
03:30:05,080 --> 03:30:06,920
Outline it in...

4878
03:30:07,530 --> 03:30:08,080
Mint.

4879
03:30:09,520 --> 03:30:10,620
Mint...

4880
03:30:11,470 --> 03:30:12,020
Like...

4881
03:30:12,020 --> 03:30:14,640
A little more...

4882
03:30:15,190 --> 03:30:17,220
A little more...

4883
03:30:17,220 --> 03:30:17,880
Like that.

4884
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:22,100
Cool.

4885
03:30:25,350 --> 03:30:25,900
Yippee!

4886
03:30:29,010 --> 03:30:30,200
Mint, mint, mint.

4887
03:30:30,200 --> 03:30:30,600
Mint, mint, mint.

4888
03:30:32,500 --> 03:30:33,560
Mint, mint, mint.

4889
03:30:33,660 --> 03:30:34,180
Stimp.

4890
03:30:35,600 --> 03:30:41,100
You might not become a pilot, but now that you're out of heaven, you could get that forklift certification.

4891
03:30:41,380 --> 03:30:41,660
I could!

4892
03:30:42,340 --> 03:30:45,040
I could get forklift certified if I wanted to.

4893
03:30:46,820 --> 03:30:47,820
Perhaps I should?

4894
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:49,860
Mint phantom.

4895
03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:53,760
Certified forklifter.

4896
03:30:58,880 --> 03:30:59,840
Let's put it...

4897
03:31:00,260 --> 03:31:00,520
Right!

4898
03:31:02,440 --> 03:31:02,780
Why is it so...

4899
03:31:02,780 --> 03:31:03,420
Why is it like that?

4900
03:31:03,500 --> 03:31:04,420
Why is it spaced like that?

4901
03:31:07,120 --> 03:31:09,300
Also, I don't think I like the...

4902
03:31:10,520 --> 03:31:12,320
Everything being capitalized.

4903
03:31:14,980 --> 03:31:15,420
That's...

4904
03:31:15,420 --> 03:31:16,260
Better.

4905
03:31:21,040 --> 03:31:22,720
Am I box certified?

4906
03:31:25,500 --> 03:31:26,540
Look into the game.

4907
03:31:26,980 --> 03:31:27,420
DCS.

4908
03:31:27,420 --> 03:31:28,940
You get to fly fighter jets.

4909
03:31:28,940 --> 03:31:30,640
The game is very, very hard.

4910
03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:32,020
You need a HOTAS.

4911
03:31:32,440 --> 03:31:34,460
But you want to try...

4912
03:31:35,100 --> 03:31:35,580
Wait...

4913
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:40,720
But you want to try to fly a game that is a step above Microsoft Flight.

4914
03:31:40,960 --> 03:31:43,940
You can fly like Maverick and do air support for Snake.

4915
03:31:44,540 --> 03:31:46,780
F-15 Super Hornet is a plane...

4916
03:31:47,920 --> 03:31:48,400
One...

4917
03:31:48,400 --> 03:31:49,780
One step at a time, maybe.

4918
03:31:51,600 --> 03:31:53,220
One step at a time, maybe.

4919
03:31:53,900 --> 03:31:54,660
One step at a time, maybe.

4920
03:32:03,570 --> 03:32:09,430
My new job has me driving a forklift and I can confirm that they're simultaneously very fun and very frustrating.

4921
03:32:10,710 --> 03:32:12,250
It's not like a...

4922
03:32:12,870 --> 03:32:13,390
It's not like a...

4923
03:32:13,390 --> 03:32:13,730
What's the word?

4924
03:32:15,350 --> 03:32:17,250
It's not stick shift or...

4925
03:32:17,250 --> 03:32:19,830
But there's like a lever you have to pull and stuff.

4926
03:32:20,050 --> 03:32:20,490
Isn't there?

4927
03:32:21,370 --> 03:32:22,450
Am I going crazy?

4928
03:32:26,030 --> 03:32:27,390
DCS is not a game.

4929
03:32:27,430 --> 03:32:28,310
It's a job.

4930
03:32:36,010 --> 03:32:36,890
But yeah...

4931
03:32:36,890 --> 03:32:38,210
I'm going to read Streamlabs now.

4932
03:32:38,570 --> 03:32:39,490
Actually, I don't...

4933
03:32:39,490 --> 03:32:41,410
Streamlabs has changed so much.

4934
03:32:41,490 --> 03:32:42,190
I can't...

4935
03:32:43,070 --> 03:32:45,830
Okay, I think if I go to here I'll be able to read it.

4936
03:32:50,050 --> 03:32:50,490
Yes.

4937
03:32:50,490 --> 03:32:55,030
Wait, why is it showing me 11 minutes ago and then 3 years ago?

4938
03:32:55,190 --> 03:32:55,750
Stop it.

4939
03:32:56,370 --> 03:32:57,370
Thank you, thank you.

4940
03:32:57,850 --> 03:32:58,690
Thank you.

4941
03:33:00,610 --> 03:33:02,590
Thanks for bringing back the good morning tweets.

4942
03:33:04,550 --> 03:33:06,430
Well, in the past I used to say Oha Minto.

4943
03:33:09,410 --> 03:33:10,330
Um... but...

4944
03:33:11,630 --> 03:33:12,090
Um...

4945
03:33:12,090 --> 03:33:13,090
I don't know.

4946
03:33:13,250 --> 03:33:16,030
I can say Oha Minto or Good Morning Minto or whatever.

4947
03:33:16,190 --> 03:33:17,210
3 years ago.

4948
03:33:18,270 --> 03:33:19,750
I think this is... No.

4949
03:33:19,910 --> 03:33:20,710
Wait, hold on.

4950
03:33:20,750 --> 03:33:21,830
This doesn't work either.

4951
03:33:22,170 --> 03:33:22,490
No!

4952
03:33:23,170 --> 03:33:24,970
Streamlabs, why do you have to change everything?

4953
03:33:26,070 --> 03:33:27,710
I can't... Wait, this... Okay.

4954
03:33:27,790 --> 03:33:27,970
Oh!

4955
03:33:28,070 --> 03:33:29,030
I have to go here.

4956
03:33:30,350 --> 03:33:30,630
Streamlabs history.

4957
03:33:30,890 --> 03:33:33,330
I figured it out.

4958
03:33:34,410 --> 03:33:36,590
I figured it out.

4959
03:33:37,930 --> 03:33:38,790
What's today?

4960
03:33:39,210 --> 03:33:39,890
7th.

4961
03:33:40,410 --> 03:33:41,090
7!

4962
03:33:42,570 --> 03:33:43,930
George Costanza.

4963
03:33:44,310 --> 03:33:44,990
7!

4964
03:33:50,850 --> 03:33:53,290
I think I just messed something up.

4965
03:33:54,670 --> 03:33:55,350
One.

4966
03:33:55,590 --> 03:33:56,830
One full BS.

4967
03:33:56,830 --> 03:33:58,070
I messed something up too.

4968
03:33:58,430 --> 03:33:59,110
I messed something up too.

4969
03:34:01,170 --> 03:34:01,750
Stop!

4970
03:34:02,370 --> 03:34:02,950
Stop!

4971
03:34:02,950 --> 03:34:03,930
OBS, why did you...

4972
03:34:03,930 --> 03:34:06,210
Everything is bad.

4973
03:34:08,230 --> 03:34:09,670
Offering to my local ghost.

4974
03:34:09,930 --> 03:34:10,710
Thank you!

4975
03:34:11,550 --> 03:34:13,110
Thank you!

4976
03:34:16,710 --> 03:34:18,270
I just got here.

4977
03:34:18,330 --> 03:34:19,030
Why are you bread?

4978
03:34:19,270 --> 03:34:21,410
Because my brain is dead.

4979
03:34:22,110 --> 03:34:24,990
My brain is dead from Zoombini time.

4980
03:34:25,530 --> 03:34:26,110
dead from Zoombini time.

4981
03:34:29,110 --> 03:34:30,170
My brain is dead.

4982
03:34:32,510 --> 03:34:34,550
The hard was actually difficult.

4983
03:34:34,850 --> 03:34:35,830
I'm so shocked.

4984
03:34:36,270 --> 03:34:37,270
I'm so shocked.

4985
03:34:38,710 --> 03:34:39,270
Okay.

4986
03:34:39,750 --> 03:34:40,450
Let's see.

4987
03:34:42,450 --> 03:34:44,870
I'm getting hungry for dinner so...

4988
03:34:44,870 --> 03:34:49,710
I'm gonna read through these and then I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

4989
03:34:50,570 --> 03:34:51,390
Oh my no.

4990
03:34:51,770 --> 03:34:53,030
It's a horror game though.

4991
03:34:53,190 --> 03:34:53,830
Oh no, I'm scared.

4992
03:35:04,840 --> 03:35:05,500
I'm scared.

4993
03:35:15,860 --> 03:35:16,500
A soup.

4994
03:35:25,250 --> 03:35:26,950
Here's a streamlabs from zero minutes ago.

4995
03:35:27,090 --> 03:35:27,510
Thanks.

4996
03:35:27,710 --> 03:35:28,690
Can I have a piece of that bread?

4997
03:35:30,510 --> 03:35:31,610
You're wanting my...

4998
03:35:32,850 --> 03:35:34,090
You're wanting my...

4999
03:35:37,270 --> 03:35:38,050
My brain?

5000
03:35:40,410 --> 03:35:41,730
You want a piece of my brain?

5001
03:35:46,410 --> 03:35:48,170
Bread equals brain is dead?

5002
03:35:48,410 --> 03:35:48,810
Yeah.

5003
03:35:50,310 --> 03:35:50,870
Bread.

5004
03:35:51,110 --> 03:35:52,090
Brain dead.

5005
03:35:54,810 --> 03:36:07,390
If we're airing our flight sim, Rainworms, I think that IL2 Stermovic is a better game for learning the basics of combat flight than DCS.

5006
03:36:07,950 --> 03:36:11,270
Flying World War 2 prop planes teaches you better fundamentals.

5007
03:36:11,510 --> 03:36:12,390
Oh my god.

5008
03:36:14,550 --> 03:36:16,110
Start at the basics.

5009
03:36:16,450 --> 03:36:19,450
Okay, where's my Wright Brothers sim then, guys?

5010
03:36:20,290 --> 03:36:23,990
If I'm starting at the basics, I'm starting at the basics.

5011
03:36:28,110 --> 03:36:30,230
We need the Wright Brothers here.

5012
03:36:30,430 --> 03:36:34,030
Then I'll move on from that to basic.

5013
03:36:34,450 --> 03:36:35,130
Never.

5014
03:36:36,310 --> 03:36:37,590
Build it yourself.

5015
03:36:38,750 --> 03:36:39,690
Icarus sim?

5016
03:36:40,410 --> 03:36:41,470
We're going way back then.

5017
03:36:41,530 --> 03:36:42,290
Oh, true.

5018
03:36:43,550 --> 03:36:45,750
We gotta go even further beyond.

5019
03:36:47,770 --> 03:36:49,890
Offering to our local Ryan Gosling.

5020
03:36:50,630 --> 03:36:51,690
He's not here.

5021
03:36:52,310 --> 03:36:52,930
Is he?

5022
03:36:56,310 --> 03:36:57,170
Mr. Ryan?

5023
03:36:58,550 --> 03:37:00,310
I missed Mint Phantom so much.

5024
03:37:00,450 --> 03:37:01,990
Mint cheer, mint cheer, mint cheer.

5025
03:37:02,510 --> 03:37:03,650
Thanks for having me.

5026
03:37:04,470 --> 03:37:06,390
Hopefully we'll have emotes again soon.

5027
03:37:06,810 --> 03:37:10,330
When I get emotes, when I do, when I get uh...

5028
03:37:10,950 --> 03:37:12,470
emotes back, we'll do karaoke.

5029
03:37:13,710 --> 03:37:14,830
Hopefully my flight...

5030
03:37:14,830 --> 03:37:15,410
My flight?

5031
03:37:15,590 --> 03:37:16,150
Dang it.

5032
03:37:17,450 --> 03:37:18,710
No, my voice.

5033
03:37:19,250 --> 03:37:19,810
Sorry.

5034
03:37:20,270 --> 03:37:22,350
It's because I read flight in the chat.

5035
03:37:22,590 --> 03:37:25,250
Hopefully my voice will be better by then.

5036
03:37:32,060 --> 03:37:33,320
I'm too influenced.

5037
03:37:33,600 --> 03:37:36,860
This is why I struggle so much with like um...

5038
03:37:38,100 --> 03:37:41,440
You know like how some people can sing harmonies immediately?

5039
03:37:41,880 --> 03:37:43,200
Like the people will be like...

5040
03:37:43,200 --> 03:37:44,180
I...

5041
03:37:44,180 --> 03:37:50,320
I can sing along with the music but instead of singing the song, I'm doing the harmonies.

5042
03:37:50,440 --> 03:37:52,560
I... I struggle so much.

5043
03:37:52,800 --> 03:37:54,900
I like mimic what I hear.

5044
03:37:55,160 --> 03:37:56,540
I mimic what I read.

5045
03:37:56,740 --> 03:37:57,440
It's so difficult.

5046
03:37:58,080 --> 03:37:58,600
Yeah.

5047
03:37:59,280 --> 03:38:00,740
They have the ear for it.

5048
03:38:00,860 --> 03:38:02,600
How do they...

5049
03:38:03,260 --> 03:38:05,480
Maybe if I plug my ears and do it along.

5050
03:38:06,620 --> 03:38:07,940
Maybe it's better.

5051
03:38:08,840 --> 03:38:09,360
Maybe.

5052
03:38:10,500 --> 03:38:12,300
The New York Times published an opinion.

5053
03:38:12,560 --> 03:38:18,460
An article that mankind was millions of years from inventing powered flight nine days before the Wright Brothers' first flight.

5054
03:38:20,120 --> 03:38:22,520
Those silly New York Times.

5055
03:38:23,020 --> 03:38:24,180
They don't know anything.

5056
03:38:24,620 --> 03:38:26,320
They're the non-believers.

5057
03:38:27,880 --> 03:38:30,220
The Wright Brothers, they were right.

5058
03:38:34,540 --> 03:38:35,480
Goodnight from me.

5059
03:38:35,560 --> 03:38:35,940
Goodnight.

5060
03:38:36,540 --> 03:38:37,440
Goodnight, goodnight.

5061
03:38:39,300 --> 03:38:41,700
Repeating things you hear is called Eccol...

5062
03:38:42,700 --> 03:38:43,260
Eccololia.

5063
03:38:47,440 --> 03:38:48,000
Actually...

5064
03:38:49,460 --> 03:38:56,780
There's a game called Rise of Flight that has World War I and earlier planes and there's an expansion for IL-2 that has them added in.

5065
03:38:56,880 --> 03:38:58,300
Flight sim people are crazy.

5066
03:38:59,660 --> 03:39:00,880
I love that though.

5067
03:39:02,100 --> 03:39:03,080
Love the passion.

5068
03:39:03,540 --> 03:39:04,100
Okay.

5069
03:39:06,080 --> 03:39:06,640
Um...

5070
03:39:06,640 --> 03:39:09,620
Some of these are from before stream and I will still read them.

5071
03:39:10,040 --> 03:39:10,380
Um...

5072
03:39:11,440 --> 03:39:13,460
So I'll just read the stream labs from today.

5073
03:39:14,480 --> 03:39:15,020
Uh...

5074
03:39:15,020 --> 03:39:16,560
Thank you!

5075
03:39:18,020 --> 03:39:18,560
Um...

5076
03:39:18,560 --> 03:39:19,280
Thank you!

5077
03:39:19,420 --> 03:39:20,600
Sometimes I get...

5078
03:39:22,360 --> 03:39:23,100
What's the word?

5079
03:39:23,360 --> 03:39:26,260
I get nervous seeing like offline donations.

5080
03:39:26,520 --> 03:39:28,260
I do appreciate them very much.

5081
03:39:28,500 --> 03:39:31,940
But I get nervous because sometimes it's like a hate message.

5082
03:39:33,040 --> 03:39:33,440
So...

5083
03:39:33,440 --> 03:39:34,400
I'm just...

5084
03:39:34,400 --> 03:39:37,560
If I have my OBS open and I hear that I get a donation, I'm like...

5085
03:39:43,660 --> 03:39:47,300
But I understand if you can't make it to the stream or something.

5086
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:49,220
So I do still appreciate it.

5087
03:39:49,640 --> 03:39:50,180
You know?

5088
03:39:50,560 --> 03:39:51,820
So, thank you.

5089
03:39:53,480 --> 03:39:53,880
Um...

5090
03:39:55,360 --> 03:39:56,160
Anonymous, thank you!

5091
03:40:00,480 --> 03:40:00,880
Uh...

5092
03:40:02,400 --> 03:40:03,440
That's a nice message.

5093
03:40:03,600 --> 03:40:04,480
I really appreciate it.

5094
03:40:05,900 --> 03:40:06,280
That's a...

5095
03:40:07,880 --> 03:40:08,900
Dado, thank you!

5096
03:40:09,700 --> 03:40:11,140
I played this so much as a kid.

5097
03:40:11,280 --> 03:40:12,240
Love the logic puzzles.

5098
03:40:12,720 --> 03:40:14,120
I even bought them remake.

5099
03:40:14,220 --> 03:40:15,300
You're playing for my niece!

5100
03:40:15,780 --> 03:40:17,660
Everyone deserves zumbinis in their childhood.

5101
03:40:17,660 --> 03:40:19,220
It's just such a good puzzle game.

5102
03:40:19,400 --> 03:40:19,940
It's so fun.

5103
03:40:21,960 --> 03:40:23,940
Try to ignore the anti ones.

5104
03:40:24,180 --> 03:40:24,760
Yeah, I do.

5105
03:40:25,420 --> 03:40:26,320
I do, I do.

5106
03:40:27,060 --> 03:40:29,000
I mostly usually ignore them.

5107
03:40:31,640 --> 03:40:32,080
So...

5108
03:40:32,540 --> 03:40:34,320
Thanks for the money, nerd.

5109
03:40:35,900 --> 03:40:36,360
For bullying them.

5110
03:40:36,600 --> 03:40:37,680
I feel like...

5111
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:40,020
Give me your money, punk!

5112
03:40:44,920 --> 03:40:46,500
Taking your lunch money.

5113
03:40:47,440 --> 03:40:48,100
Um...

5114
03:40:48,100 --> 03:40:48,960
Thank you!

5115
03:40:50,940 --> 03:40:51,600
Um...

5116
03:40:52,960 --> 03:40:54,280
Thank you!

5117
03:40:54,700 --> 03:40:55,700
And Ronan, thank you again!

5118
03:40:56,820 --> 03:40:57,480
Um...

5119
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:01,280
Hope you're having a wonderful day!

5120
03:41:01,540 --> 03:41:01,900
You too!

5121
03:41:03,480 --> 03:41:05,100
Tyranzor Catastrophe, thank you!

5122
03:41:05,380 --> 03:41:05,900

03:41:07,140 --> 03:41:08,480
Good luck with your job tomorrow!

5125
03:41:09,160 --> 03:41:09,680
Oh my gosh.

5127
03:41:14,980 --> 03:41:16,100
Sub-Zero Mudkips, thank you!

5128
03:41:16,940 --> 03:41:19,920
Do you think we'll eventually get a dono rap?

5129
03:41:20,180 --> 03:41:20,260
Do you think we'll eventually get a dono rap?

5130
03:41:20,260 --> 03:41:20,620
What's that?

5131
03:41:22,680 --> 03:41:24,140
Where I rap the donations?

5132
03:41:25,040 --> 03:41:25,960
Where I rap the donations?

5133
03:41:26,600 --> 03:41:27,120
Whoa!

5134
03:41:27,300 --> 03:41:27,740
Yo!

5135
03:41:27,900 --> 03:41:28,720
Wow this duck!

5136
03:41:28,900 --> 03:41:29,800
Thanks very much!

5137
03:41:29,800 --> 03:41:31,460
Joan, thank you!

5138
03:41:32,200 --> 03:41:32,760
See...

5139
03:41:32,760 --> 03:41:34,360
It's good seeing you again!

5140
03:41:34,660 --> 03:41:37,020
Ronan, thanks for the donation!

5141
03:41:37,200 --> 03:41:39,300
Mr. Yoda, ooh ooh yeah!

5142
03:41:40,040 --> 03:41:40,600
Um...

5143
03:41:41,680 --> 03:41:43,120
But I can't rap.

5144
03:41:43,360 --> 03:41:45,020
I can't dono rap and read the...

5145
03:41:45,920 --> 03:41:47,880
Read the messages at the same time.

5146
03:41:52,180 --> 03:41:52,740
Um...

5147
03:41:55,020 --> 03:41:57,420
Can't believe my Oshii is bullying me for lunch money!

5148
03:41:57,420 --> 03:41:58,380
Wapsha!

5149
03:41:59,160 --> 03:41:59,640
Yeah.

5150
03:42:01,860 --> 03:42:02,980
Good enough for me.

5151
03:42:04,460 --> 03:42:06,040
Need a BGM for the beat.

5152
03:42:06,280 --> 03:42:07,180
Yeah, for real.

5153
03:42:08,200 --> 03:42:09,100
Arigato, arigato!

5154
03:42:09,340 --> 03:42:11,980
This game is etching to my soul from 25 plus years ago.

5155
03:42:12,180 --> 03:42:15,200
Always great to see someone else who can sing along with the soundtrack.

5156
03:42:15,700 --> 03:42:16,660
I'm telling ya.

5157
03:42:19,360 --> 03:42:21,580
I played this game way so much.

5158
03:42:21,740 --> 03:42:22,520
Oh, wait, hold on.

5159
03:42:24,500 --> 03:42:24,980
Um...

5160
03:42:24,980 --> 03:42:25,820
Um...

5161
03:42:27,740 --> 03:42:28,200
Um...

5162
03:42:32,280 --> 03:42:32,740
Wait...

5163
03:42:32,740 --> 03:42:34,640
Oh, yes, there we go.

5164
03:42:34,740 --> 03:42:35,740
Karma, thank you!

5165
03:42:37,100 --> 03:42:40,820

5166
03:42:42,740 --> 03:42:43,500
Mr. Comb Jelly, thank you!

5167
03:42:43,500 --> 03:42:43,960
Mr. Yoda, thank you!

5168
03:42:45,480 --> 03:42:45,940
Mr. Yoda, thank you!

5169
03:42:45,940 --> 03:42:48,700
Why do so many of the Zoominie names sound like setups for D's nuts jokes?

5170
03:42:49,600 --> 03:42:51,420
Azumaya Aru!久しぶり!

5171
03:42:52,520 --> 03:42:53,020

03:42:53,880 --> 03:42:54,780
Arigato, arigato!

5173
03:42:55,040 --> 03:42:56,800
Good luck guiding the Zoom...

5174
03:42:57,420 --> 03:42:58,080
Zooms to salvation!

5175
03:42:58,900 --> 03:43:00,300

03:43:20,240 --> 03:43:21,040
Thank you!

5187
03:43:22,260 --> 03:43:24,600
So many names I haven't seen in so long.

5188
03:43:25,820 --> 03:43:26,940
Nan, thank you!

5189
03:43:27,420 --> 03:43:28,740
Sunchips, thank you!

5190
03:43:31,160 --> 03:43:33,020
Meep, meep, meep, meep!

5191
03:43:33,060 --> 03:43:34,320
Meep, meep, meep, meep!

5192
03:43:34,400 --> 03:43:36,080

5193
03:43:36,540 --> 03:43:37,400

Ryland, thank you!

5195
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:41,620
Bestest maid ever?

5196
03:43:43,160 --> 03:43:43,920
Nah...

5197
03:43:46,280 --> 03:43:47,040
Nah...

5198
03:43:47,040 --> 03:43:49,660
Not the bestest maid ever...

5199
03:43:50,300 --> 03:43:50,540
Not the bestest maid ever...

5200
03:43:57,420 --> 03:43:58,180
No...

5201
03:44:00,220 --> 03:44:00,980
Nah...

5202
03:44:02,260 --> 03:44:03,020
Stop...

5203
03:44:04,260 --> 03:44:05,020
No...

5204
03:44:05,020 --> 03:44:06,180
Mmm...

5205
03:44:06,180 --> 03:44:07,120
Arigato, arigato!

5206
03:44:09,420 --> 03:44:10,180
No...

5207
03:44:13,020 --> 03:44:14,180
Zalpios, thank you!

5208
03:44:15,140 --> 03:44:15,580

03:44:20,380 --> 03:44:21,640
Is this Scribblenaut?

5212
03:44:22,820 --> 03:44:24,140
But maybe...

5213
03:44:24,140 --> 03:44:26,460
The predecessor...

5214
03:44:27,520 --> 03:44:28,800
Soryoneko, thank you!

5215
03:44:29,420 --> 03:44:32,920
I'm fairly new to your stream, but for the short time I've been here, I'm really enjoying what I see.

5216
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:34,520
You mint are such a delight.

5217
03:44:35,360 --> 03:44:36,020
Thank you!

5218
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:37,860
Thank you so much.

5219
03:44:38,200 --> 03:44:39,340
Love being minty fresh.

5220
03:44:41,960 --> 03:44:42,740

5221
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:45,100
JoshuaHugo, thank you!

5222
03:44:46,080 --> 03:44:52,580
I've listened to you sing Snake Eater in Heaven's Divide so many times from your return stream, and I'm always in awe of the power of your singing voice.

5223
03:44:52,700 --> 03:44:56,320
I'm happy you are back and looking forward to more of your goofiness, my kamiushi.

5224
03:44:57,020 --> 03:44:57,500
WAAAH!

5225
03:44:57,760 --> 03:45:01,380
Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed though, because my throat was giving out.

5226
03:45:02,640 --> 03:45:04,400
Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed though, because my throat was giving out.

5227
03:45:07,400 --> 03:45:08,640
RayMac, thank you!

5228
03:45:09,060 --> 03:45:09,200
RayMac, thank you!

5229
03:45:09,200 --> 03:45:09,220
RayMac, thank you!

5230
03:45:10,340 --> 03:45:12,000
ZunbiniFrogXcent, there you go, you got it!

5231
03:45:12,260 --> 03:45:12,720
ZunbiniFrogXcent, there you go, you got it!

5232
03:45:12,720 --> 03:45:14,220
There you go, you got it!

5233
03:45:18,120 --> 03:45:19,140
Didn't sound like it?

5234
03:45:19,220 --> 03:45:20,060
Oh, it definitely was.

5235
03:45:21,000 --> 03:45:22,320
It's full of soul.

5236
03:45:22,760 --> 03:45:24,240
Why do you spell soul like that?

5237
03:45:24,880 --> 03:45:25,660
With a V.

5238
03:45:26,320 --> 03:45:27,080
Soul.

5239
03:45:27,200 --> 03:45:27,460
Soul.

5240
03:45:28,220 --> 03:45:30,820
Full of soul.

5241
03:45:38,040 --> 03:45:40,140
Hey there, pretty lady.

5242
03:45:42,400 --> 03:45:44,480
I feel like I'm reading LeetSpeak.

5243
03:45:45,280 --> 03:45:50,820
You know how, like, when they change the E's to 3's?

5244
03:45:51,200 --> 03:45:53,460
The T's to 7's?

5245
03:45:54,620 --> 03:45:55,420
Ugh.

5246
03:45:55,520 --> 03:45:56,300
Ugh.

5247
03:45:58,060 --> 03:45:58,880
Treebomber, thank you!

5248
03:46:00,080 --> 03:46:01,140
Mindmaster, thank you!

5249
03:46:01,380 --> 03:46:03,500
Here's a choot for everyone in Mint Chord.

5250
03:46:04,740 --> 03:46:05,980
Nan, thank you!

5251
03:46:07,320 --> 03:46:09,660
Eating Mike Tyson's butt, thank you!

5252
03:46:10,840 --> 03:46:10,980
Eating Mike Tyson's butt, thank you!

5253
03:46:11,860 --> 03:46:12,700
MintyFreshKyle, thank you!

5254
03:46:12,960 --> 03:46:14,220
Eric W, I thank you!

5255
03:46:15,360 --> 03:46:18,160
Maybe if you talk to him in a frog voice, he'll understand and listen.

5256
03:46:18,520 --> 03:46:18,980
Maybe if you talk to him in a frog voice, he'll understand and listen.

5257
03:46:18,980 --> 03:46:19,520
I should've.

5258
03:46:20,300 --> 03:46:21,260
I should've.

5259
03:46:21,280 --> 03:46:22,040
I should've.

5260
03:46:22,040 --> 03:46:23,280
I should've!

5261
03:46:24,740 --> 03:46:25,540
The legend.

5262
03:46:26,940 --> 03:46:28,160
Thank you guys for the donations!

5263
03:46:28,800 --> 03:46:29,520
Impload, thank you!

5264
03:46:29,820 --> 03:46:31,100
Mr. Yuta, thank you again!

5265
03:46:32,100 --> 03:46:32,800
SithSpawn, thank you!

5266
03:46:34,060 --> 03:46:37,160
For great old PC games, you should look up Stay Tuned.

5267
03:46:37,480 --> 03:46:39,920
If you haven't seen or played it before, it's so silly and fun.

5268
03:46:40,160 --> 03:46:43,600
It's a bit hard to play nowadays, as it doesn't have a modern re-release.

5269
03:46:43,760 --> 03:46:45,040
But there are ways to do it.

5270
03:46:45,920 --> 03:46:52,000
I'll be honest, I did try to find a way to play the original of the Zumbi.

5271
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:52,020
I'll be honest, I did try to find a way to play the original of the Zumbi.

5272
03:46:52,660 --> 03:46:53,120
But...

5273
03:46:54,180 --> 03:46:56,100
I couldn't get it to work.

5274
03:46:56,980 --> 03:46:57,440
And...

5275
03:46:59,680 --> 03:47:02,160
With the time I...

5276
03:47:03,060 --> 03:47:03,520
Rather...

5277
03:47:03,520 --> 03:47:04,540
What's the word?

5278
03:47:07,020 --> 03:47:08,160
How much time I had?

5279
03:47:08,240 --> 03:47:08,900
Before stream?

5280
03:47:09,120 --> 03:47:11,200
I couldn't get it to work.

5281
03:47:12,440 --> 03:47:13,520
But that's okay.

5282
03:47:13,660 --> 03:47:15,360
I think this one was still good enough.

5283
03:47:16,600 --> 03:47:17,060
Yeah.

5284
03:47:20,260 --> 03:47:20,720
Yeah.

5285
03:47:22,020 --> 03:47:22,180
Thank you!

5286
03:47:22,300 --> 03:47:24,040
Staff member has died.

5287
03:47:24,260 --> 03:47:24,720
Oh my god.

5288
03:47:26,240 --> 03:47:27,160
Invictus, thank you!

5289
03:47:27,240 --> 03:47:28,000
Mint the murderer.

5290
03:47:28,260 --> 03:47:33,180
I was just trying to show you something cool.

5291
03:47:34,280 --> 03:47:35,140
A death.

5292
03:47:37,860 --> 03:47:38,740
Pandapalooza, thank you!

5293
03:47:40,720 --> 03:47:45,840
The moment you mentioned Zumbinis yesterday, I had a Pixar flashback moment to 3rd grade computer lab.

5294
03:47:46,080 --> 03:47:48,160
This and Treasure Mathstorm were my jam.

5295
03:47:49,880 --> 03:47:50,400
Yes!

5296
03:47:52,020 --> 03:47:52,100
Ah!

5297
03:47:53,770 --> 03:47:54,960
Wildest Duck, thank you!

5298
03:47:56,380 --> 03:47:57,860
Mint, you killed a Zumbini.

5299
03:47:58,200 --> 03:47:58,780
Amazing!

5300
03:47:58,980 --> 03:47:59,560
Mission complete!

5301
03:47:59,760 --> 03:48:02,160
That right there is why you're the best boss.

5302
03:48:03,400 --> 03:48:04,380
Kaito, thank you!

5303
03:48:04,640 --> 03:48:05,620
Isabelle, thank you!

5304
03:48:07,220 --> 03:48:07,800
Uh...

5305
03:48:07,800 --> 03:48:10,280
David Titanium...

5306
03:48:10,280 --> 03:48:12,160
PP, thank you!

5307
03:48:13,340 --> 03:48:13,920
Mama...

5308
03:48:13,920 --> 03:48:16,060
Just killed a man...

5309
03:48:16,060 --> 03:48:17,700
If I do karaoke...

5310
03:48:17,700 --> 03:48:20,020
Once I get memberships...

5311
03:48:20,580 --> 03:48:21,140
...

5312
03:48:22,020 --> 03:48:23,440
What kind of karaoke should I do?

5313
03:48:25,720 --> 03:48:26,820
What kind of karaoke?

5314
03:48:27,200 --> 03:48:27,580
What kind of karaoke?

5315
03:48:36,140 --> 03:48:37,160
Whatever you want.

5316
03:48:37,360 --> 03:48:38,220
So true.

5317
03:48:40,340 --> 03:48:41,980
Nacho Libre OST.

5318
03:48:42,780 --> 03:48:43,420
Nacho Libre OST.

5319
03:48:44,540 --> 03:48:45,060
Nacho Libre OST.

5320
03:48:45,060 --> 03:48:45,880
Heavy metal.

5321
03:48:47,420 --> 03:48:49,840
My throat is just coming back.

5322
03:48:50,520 --> 03:48:50,560
My throat is just coming back.

5323
03:48:52,120 --> 03:48:53,440
Black metal, please.

5324
03:48:53,820 --> 03:48:55,340
Do you guys want me to have a throat?

5325
03:48:55,460 --> 03:48:56,580
A voice or not?

5326
03:49:01,260 --> 03:49:02,600
I'm not asking you guys.

5327
03:49:02,760 --> 03:49:04,460
I'm gonna sing whatever I want.

5328
03:49:06,960 --> 03:49:07,400
Uh...

5329
03:49:07,400 --> 03:49:08,580
Ease Jimmy, thank you!

5330
03:49:10,200 --> 03:49:12,280
Now we know why you're not allowed in heaven anymore.

5331
03:49:12,400 --> 03:49:12,640
Stop!

5332
03:49:14,420 --> 03:49:15,720
William Luong, thank you!

5333
03:49:16,280 --> 03:49:17,160
Fukuro, thank you!

5334
03:49:18,200 --> 03:49:19,480
Retro Puffy, thank you!

5335
03:49:22,200 --> 03:49:23,220
Rico, thank you!

5336
03:49:23,420 --> 03:49:24,240
Puff, thank you!

5337
03:49:25,400 --> 03:49:25,840
Uh...

5338
03:49:25,840 --> 03:49:26,560
Takedo X, thank you!

5339
03:49:26,560 --> 03:49:27,920
Extra... oh, X, thank you!

5340
03:49:30,340 --> 03:49:31,200
John, thank you!

5341
03:49:32,060 --> 03:49:32,880
Anonymous, thank you!

5342
03:49:33,900 --> 03:49:37,340
Never even heard of this game and somehow it's still giving me nostalgic vibes.

5343
03:49:37,500 --> 03:49:37,680
Right?

5344
03:49:37,980 --> 03:49:38,380
I know.

5345
03:49:40,620 --> 03:49:41,340
For sure.

5346
03:49:44,980 --> 03:49:45,880
Arigato, arigato!

5347
03:49:46,440 --> 03:49:46,880
Chuuu!

5348
03:49:47,500 --> 03:49:47,940
Chuuu!

5349
03:49:52,000 --> 03:49:52,680
Steak da ne?

5350
03:49:53,100 --> 03:49:53,800
Steak Dane?

5351
03:49:54,280 --> 03:49:54,940
Stecky da ne?

5352
03:49:56,560 --> 03:49:57,220
Steak Dane.

5353
03:49:57,380 --> 03:49:58,600
Okay, I can try that one.

5354
03:49:58,980 --> 03:50:00,640
Seven colors of Nico Nico douka.

5355
03:50:01,580 --> 03:50:02,560
Oku sen man!

5356
03:50:03,920 --> 03:50:04,840
Oku sen man!

5357
03:50:05,060 --> 03:50:05,800
Oku sen man!

5358
03:50:06,360 --> 03:50:06,660
Chuuu!

5359
03:50:09,100 --> 03:50:09,540
Um...

5360
03:50:13,050 --> 03:50:14,090
Raven's back, thank you!

5361
03:50:17,730 --> 03:50:20,050
I've never played this game but I would always watch the trailer.

5362
03:50:20,350 --> 03:50:21,390
Ads for it.

5363
03:50:21,470 --> 03:50:23,110
And the Clue Finders game mantra.

5364
03:50:23,590 --> 03:50:25,250
Did you ever play any of those games?

5365
03:50:25,370 --> 03:50:26,010
I don't think so.

5366
03:50:28,030 --> 03:50:29,210
I'm gonna look it up right now.

5367
03:50:29,310 --> 03:50:30,310
Clue Finders.

5368
03:50:31,330 --> 03:50:32,990
Maybe if I see it, I'll remember.

5369
03:50:34,530 --> 03:50:35,050
Oh...

5370
03:50:36,430 --> 03:50:36,950
Oh...

5371
03:50:36,950 --> 03:50:42,630
I, for some reason, vaguely remember the Pyramid one.

5372
03:50:45,670 --> 03:50:47,410
But maybe I didn't have it.

5373
03:50:47,470 --> 03:50:48,510
Maybe a friend had it.

5374
03:50:48,650 --> 03:50:50,170
I don't think I had this game.

5375
03:50:52,590 --> 03:50:55,110
I think a friend had this one.

5376
03:50:55,110 --> 03:50:57,070
And I don't think I had it.

5377
03:50:57,150 --> 03:50:57,890
I don't know.

5378
03:50:58,910 --> 03:50:59,350
Maybe.

5379
03:51:01,310 --> 03:51:02,750
The Pyramid one was a nightmare?

5380
03:51:05,130 --> 03:51:06,110
I don't know.

5381
03:51:10,130 --> 03:51:10,990
Yeah, I don't know.

5382
03:51:14,390 --> 03:51:15,830
It looks familiar though.

5383
03:51:17,030 --> 03:51:26,050
Maybe because it looks kind of like you know how a lot of like animation from that time looked very much like it kind of looks like the magic school bus.

5384
03:51:26,270 --> 03:51:26,790
You know what I mean?

5385
03:51:30,090 --> 03:51:30,550
No...

5386
03:51:32,150 --> 03:51:33,410
Dog Strings, thank you!

5387
03:51:34,410 --> 03:51:35,330
Murphy, thank you!

5388
03:51:35,910 --> 03:51:37,110
AJ Shell, thank you!

5389
03:51:39,370 --> 03:51:40,630
Mr. Yuta, thank you!

5390
03:51:41,930 --> 03:51:42,890
Shrookey, thank you!

5391
03:51:43,870 --> 03:51:45,150
Jeremy Abel, thank you!

5392
03:51:46,050 --> 03:51:47,770
TV Juice Enjoyer, thank you!

5393
03:51:48,450 --> 03:51:49,350
Kaito, thank you!

5394
03:51:50,590 --> 03:51:51,630
Jubilathan, thank you!

5395
03:51:53,050 --> 03:51:53,510
Jubilathan, thank you!

5396
03:51:54,610 --> 03:51:55,810
Scrookster, thank you!

5397
03:51:58,430 --> 03:51:59,750
Mr. Yuta, thank you again!

5398
03:51:59,810 --> 03:52:02,170
Thank you so much for all the donations!

5399
03:52:04,250 --> 03:52:09,790
Gotta beat a leg of the journey perfectly perfectly three times to raise its difficulty by one level.

5400
03:52:10,870 --> 03:52:11,790
Okay, okay, okay.

5401
03:52:12,050 --> 03:52:15,210
But of course you can just try harder difficulties in practice mode too.

5402
03:52:15,370 --> 03:52:16,050
Got it!

5403
03:52:16,110 --> 03:52:16,330
Okay.

5404
03:52:16,850 --> 03:52:18,650
For whenever I come back to zoom my knees.

5405
03:52:20,070 --> 03:52:21,030
JamieDX, thank you!

5406
03:52:22,870 --> 03:52:24,210
What a stream for my birthday!

5407
03:52:24,390 --> 03:52:26,390
Oh my god, happy birthday!

5408
03:52:29,810 --> 03:52:33,470
Happy birthday to you!

5409
03:52:34,250 --> 03:52:37,470
Happy birthday to you!

5410
03:52:38,210 --> 03:52:41,530
Happy birthday JamieDX!

5411
03:52:42,630 --> 03:52:47,450
Happy birthday to you!

5412
03:52:49,810 --> 03:52:51,570
Happy birthday!

5413
03:52:52,490 --> 03:52:55,870
Thanks for spending your birthday with us!

5414
03:52:56,910 --> 03:52:58,330
Hopefully you get some good cake.

5415
03:52:59,610 --> 03:53:01,530
Wait, what time does the store close?

5416
03:53:09,200 --> 03:53:09,600
Oh!

5417
03:53:10,300 --> 03:53:11,440
Oh, I have an hour!

5418
03:53:11,700 --> 03:53:12,080
Okay.

5419
03:53:12,380 --> 03:53:13,860
I have an hour to go to the store.

5420
03:53:14,400 --> 03:53:17,780
I suddenly wanted a very specific cake that is only sold at a certain store.

5421
03:53:19,220 --> 03:53:20,440
So I'm gonna go get that.

5422
03:53:21,920 --> 03:53:22,340
Um...

5423
03:53:26,380 --> 03:53:27,720
Minty Fresh Kyle, thank you!

5424
03:53:28,280 --> 03:53:29,580
Ume Aino, thank you!

5425
03:53:30,440 --> 03:53:31,940
Italian Loves Cake, thank you!

5426
03:53:32,940 --> 03:53:35,120
If they want pizza so bad, why don't they make them?

5427
03:53:35,200 --> 03:53:35,920
I know!

5428
03:53:36,040 --> 03:53:37,540
And the machine is right there!

5429
03:53:38,640 --> 03:53:39,540
Rico, thank you!

5430
03:53:40,480 --> 03:53:41,600
Kiki Cadaver, thank you!

5431
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:43,540
Um...

5432
03:53:43,540 --> 03:53:46,060
I'll check out that Virtual Villagers thing.

5433
03:53:46,100 --> 03:53:46,600
I've never heard of it.

5434
03:53:46,600 --> 03:53:48,100
Minty Fresh Kyle, thank you!

5435
03:53:48,260 --> 03:53:49,240
Shin Solar, thank you!

5436
03:53:49,460 --> 03:53:50,240
Osos, thank you!

5437
03:53:50,500 --> 03:53:51,280
Seymour, thank you!

5438
03:53:51,680 --> 03:53:52,520
Dado, thank you!

5439
03:53:53,360 --> 03:53:56,160
People on Steam reported this as a bug, but it hasn't been fixed yet.

5440
03:53:56,340 --> 03:53:57,420
I see, I see.

5441
03:53:58,240 --> 03:53:58,980
Kaito, thank you!

5442
03:54:00,420 --> 03:54:01,440
See you later, Mint!

5443
03:54:01,580 --> 03:54:02,140
Many thanks!

5444
03:54:02,260 --> 03:54:02,960
No, thank you!

5445
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:04,120
Thanks for hanging out!

5446
03:54:04,380 --> 03:54:05,360
Really appreciate it.

5447
03:54:05,820 --> 03:54:06,340
Thank you.

5448
03:54:06,380 --> 03:54:08,440
I didn't think so many people would be here for...

5449
03:54:09,100 --> 03:54:09,500
for...

5450
03:54:10,760 --> 03:54:11,960
childhood baby game.

5451
03:54:13,900 --> 03:54:14,620
Kaito, thank you!

5452
03:54:14,720 --> 03:54:15,720
Minty Fresh Kyle, thank you!

5453
03:54:15,920 --> 03:54:16,580
Ume, thank you!

5454
03:54:17,260 --> 03:54:18,020
Vivico, thank you!

5455
03:54:19,400 --> 03:54:20,180
Akabar, thank you!

5456
03:54:20,500 --> 03:54:21,340
Virulent, thank you!

5457
03:54:22,060 --> 03:54:23,740
Aria, thank you again for the Akadono!

5458
03:54:23,820 --> 03:54:24,520
Thank you so much!

5459
03:54:24,840 --> 03:54:25,480
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5460
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:27,440
Um...

5461
03:54:29,880 --> 03:54:30,700
Nylok, thank you!

5462
03:54:31,420 --> 03:54:32,740
Mint stole another soul.

5463
03:54:34,320 --> 03:54:35,580
Thanks for Zoominia's fun stream.

5464
03:54:35,660 --> 03:54:36,900
Looking forward to podcast Monday.

5465
03:54:37,220 --> 03:54:37,840
Fly high, Mint.

5466
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:40,720
Yeah, I think next episode is pretty good, so...

5467
03:54:41,220 --> 03:54:41,620
Um...

5468
03:54:42,480 --> 03:54:44,140
For people who thought that there were...

5469
03:54:44,140 --> 03:54:46,140
or had complaints about the first episode, like...

5470
03:54:46,600 --> 03:54:46,960
some things...

5471
03:54:46,960 --> 03:54:50,340
I think we improved upon it in the second episode.

5472
03:54:50,680 --> 03:54:50,880
So...

5473
03:54:53,200 --> 03:54:53,760
Yeah...

5474
03:54:54,460 --> 03:54:55,380
Cinderathalos, thank you!

5475
03:54:57,140 --> 03:54:57,700
Um...

5476
03:54:58,720 --> 03:55:00,440
Ume Haino, thank you again!

5477
03:55:02,180 --> 03:55:03,200
Spank, thank you!

5478
03:55:04,300 --> 03:55:04,620
Uh...

5479
03:55:05,520 --> 03:55:06,800
Kamendachi, thank you!

5480
03:55:07,740 --> 03:55:08,780
Seymour, thank you!

5481
03:55:09,400 --> 03:55:10,320
Kevarn, thank you!

5482
03:55:10,560 --> 03:55:11,340
Rico, thank you!

5483
03:55:12,500 --> 03:55:13,060
Um...

5484
03:55:14,200 --> 03:55:15,020
Korin, thank you!

5485
03:55:15,280 --> 03:55:17,540
Savictiv... Savicticus, thank you!

5486
03:55:18,700 --> 03:55:19,080
Um...

5487
03:55:19,080 --> 03:55:20,200
Mintyfreshkyle, thank you!

5488
03:55:20,460 --> 03:55:21,180
Israfel, thank you!

5489
03:55:21,540 --> 03:55:22,320
Kinkykidubber, thank you!

5490
03:55:24,380 --> 03:55:24,840
Um...

5491
03:55:24,840 --> 03:55:26,380
Never realized it was that expensive.

5492
03:55:26,700 --> 03:55:30,140
Because, like, at least four of my friends have pilot licenses for their Crop Duster.

5493
03:55:30,240 --> 03:55:30,760
That's crazy!

5494
03:55:32,400 --> 03:55:33,220
That's crazy!

5495
03:55:33,440 --> 03:55:35,660
Everyone had to spend so much!

5496
03:55:37,020 --> 03:55:39,100
I'm surprised people had complaints about the first episode.

5497
03:55:39,220 --> 03:55:39,780
There were...

5498
03:55:39,780 --> 03:55:43,100
I say complaints, but it was really, like, constructive criticism.

5499
03:55:43,620 --> 03:55:44,200
You know?

5500
03:55:44,220 --> 03:55:45,300
And we asked for it.

5501
03:55:45,340 --> 03:55:49,920
We said, like, please, please give us constructive criticism since we've never done a podcast before.

5502
03:55:50,100 --> 03:55:53,720
And so we are looking to improve as much as we can, so...

5503
03:55:53,720 --> 03:55:54,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5504
03:55:54,620 --> 03:55:55,980
Will there be another Patreon video?

5505
03:55:56,120 --> 03:55:57,380
Yes, there will be!

5506
03:55:57,540 --> 03:55:58,020
Yup, yup.

5507
03:55:59,140 --> 03:56:03,080
Which actually is almost the same length as...

5508
03:56:04,980 --> 03:56:06,240
As the podcast!

5509
03:56:06,440 --> 03:56:07,860
Oh my gosh, what was that gif?

5510
03:56:10,020 --> 03:56:15,320
We ended up talking so much in the Patreon video too, so...

5511
03:56:16,180 --> 03:56:16,660
Yeah...

5512
03:56:18,020 --> 03:56:18,500
Um...

5513
03:56:19,480 --> 03:56:19,960
Yeah...

5514
03:56:20,820 --> 03:56:21,600
What was it?

5515
03:56:22,700 --> 03:56:23,180
Oh!

5516
03:56:24,440 --> 03:56:26,440
We brought up the spy animals.

5517
03:56:28,280 --> 03:56:33,140
It's more fresh on my mind because we recorded it just a couple days ago, so...

5518
03:56:33,140 --> 03:56:33,240
It's more fresh on my mind because we recorded it just a couple days ago, so...

5519
03:56:33,240 --> 03:56:33,480
Um...

5520
03:56:33,480 --> 03:56:34,520
Thank you, Cadaver, thank you!

5521
03:56:35,680 --> 03:56:36,500
Corrin, thank you!

5522
03:56:38,020 --> 03:56:38,920
DuckDuck, thank you!

5523
03:56:39,920 --> 03:56:40,820
Kamendachi, thank you!

5524
03:56:41,940 --> 03:56:43,220
This is your captain speaking.

5525
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:46,780
If you want this plane to land, someone has to beat me in a children's card game!

5526
03:56:49,600 --> 03:56:50,780
That's what they should do.

5527
03:56:50,900 --> 03:56:56,080
You know how, like, when sometimes they can't land because they're waiting for, like, their spot to, uh...

5528
03:56:57,800 --> 03:56:58,680
To, um...

5529
03:56:58,680 --> 03:57:01,560
In line to, like, be able to use the runway?

5530
03:57:01,780 --> 03:57:04,260
They should just have it so that, um...

5531
03:57:04,260 --> 03:57:05,480
They should just, like...

5532
03:57:05,480 --> 03:57:08,840
Invite the passengers to, um...

5533
03:57:08,840 --> 03:57:09,740
Play games.

5534
03:57:10,640 --> 03:57:11,520
Come on, captain.

5535
03:57:12,600 --> 03:57:13,560
That's what I would do.

5536
03:57:13,620 --> 03:57:14,320
I would be that...

5537
03:57:14,320 --> 03:57:16,000
Oh my gosh, you know how there's, like, cool moms?

5538
03:57:16,280 --> 03:57:17,700
I'm the cool captain.

5539
03:57:20,140 --> 03:57:21,380
I let you...

5540
03:57:21,380 --> 03:57:23,200
I let you, um...

5541
03:57:23,200 --> 03:57:24,860
Land with your...

5542
03:57:24,860 --> 03:57:26,320
With your tray table down.

5543
03:57:29,620 --> 03:57:30,140
I...

5544
03:57:30,140 --> 03:57:30,620
I...

5545
03:57:30,620 --> 03:57:32,780
You know, you don't have to stow those belongings.

5546
03:57:32,780 --> 03:57:34,680
Don't worry about it.

5547
03:57:34,720 --> 03:57:36,320
I'm... I'm so cool.

5548
03:57:41,060 --> 03:57:42,300
Coolest captain ever.

5549
03:57:42,380 --> 03:57:43,460
I'm not like other captains.

5550
03:57:44,780 --> 03:57:45,980
I'm the cool captain.

5551
03:57:47,120 --> 03:57:47,600
Uh...

5552
03:57:47,600 --> 03:57:48,300
Thank you!

5553
03:57:49,820 --> 03:57:52,420
Flight sim is extremely accurate with the controls.

5554
03:57:52,520 --> 03:57:53,180
From what I remember.

5555
03:57:53,440 --> 03:57:55,660
If you make it so, it can be pretty intense.

5556
03:57:55,900 --> 03:57:56,420
Cool!

5557
03:57:57,400 --> 03:57:57,860
I'm excited.

5558
03:57:58,540 --> 03:57:58,820
Thank you!

5559
03:58:00,800 --> 03:58:01,920
Thank you!

5560
03:58:02,820 --> 03:58:03,220
Wait.

5561
03:58:03,220 --> 03:58:04,200
Oh, I read all these.

5562
03:58:04,260 --> 03:58:04,800
I'm so sorry.

5563
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:05,800
Oh my gosh, I just realized.

5564
03:58:07,860 --> 03:58:08,260
Um...

5565
03:58:08,720 --> 03:58:10,020
Thank you!

5566
03:58:10,160 --> 03:58:11,320
Thank you!

5567
03:58:12,480 --> 03:58:13,280
Thank you!

5568
03:58:13,940 --> 03:58:17,960
If they can shoot lasers into your eyes, they can make lasers shoot out of your eyes.

5569
03:58:17,980 --> 03:58:19,080
Oh, can't they make...

5570
03:58:19,080 --> 03:58:21,880
Yeah, can't they make lasers shoot out of our eyes?

5571
03:58:22,060 --> 03:58:22,420
So true.

5572
03:58:25,300 --> 03:58:26,560
Captain Welfare, thank you!

5573
03:58:27,340 --> 03:58:28,240
Mr. Fowl, thank you!

5574
03:58:28,600 --> 03:58:29,400
Sideways, thank you!

5575
03:58:29,940 --> 03:58:31,020
Nicole, thank you!

5576
03:58:32,780 --> 03:58:33,400
Corrin, thank you!

5577
03:58:34,520 --> 03:58:34,880
Um...

5578
03:58:36,680 --> 03:58:37,400
J Ikeda?

5579
03:58:38,080 --> 03:58:39,160
J L Keda?

5580
03:58:39,520 --> 03:58:41,760
Is it... I think it's an I.

5581
03:58:43,160 --> 03:58:43,740
Thank you!

5582
03:58:45,360 --> 03:58:45,720
Uh...

5583
03:58:45,720 --> 03:58:46,600
Rabbit, thank you!

5584
03:58:46,880 --> 03:58:48,160
JB Hut, thank you!

5585
03:58:50,440 --> 03:58:51,180
Corrin, thank you!

5586
03:58:52,700 --> 03:58:53,800
Derpy's Derp, thank you!

5587
03:58:53,920 --> 03:58:54,360
Oh my gosh.

5588
03:58:55,920 --> 03:58:56,820
Rungby Rabbit, thank you!

5589
03:58:59,500 --> 03:59:00,260
Thank you for the stream.

5590
03:59:00,320 --> 03:59:02,220
It was a lot of fun seeing you enjoy your childhood game again.

5591
03:59:02,780 --> 03:59:03,340
Thank you so much!

5592
03:59:03,420 --> 03:59:05,260
Thanks for the stream.

5593
03:59:05,320 --> 03:59:06,640
Very nostalgic seeing this game again.

5594
03:59:06,720 --> 03:59:07,460
Thank you so much.

5595
03:59:07,480 --> 03:59:08,060
Thank you guys.

5596
03:59:08,520 --> 03:59:09,780
Appreciate it so much.

5597
03:59:11,000 --> 03:59:11,520
Um...

5598
03:59:12,080 --> 03:59:13,180
Inane, thank you!

5599
03:59:13,700 --> 03:59:14,720
Rico, thank you!

5600
03:59:15,920 --> 03:59:17,000
Pinkerton, thank you!

5601
03:59:18,380 --> 03:59:19,320
Pokidona, thank you!

5602
03:59:21,540 --> 03:59:22,680
Hypothetical lunch money.

5603
03:59:22,860 --> 03:59:24,040
I usually skip lunch.

5604
03:59:24,200 --> 03:59:26,340
But dinner funds are where I draw the line.

5605
03:59:26,620 --> 03:59:27,140
Maybe.

5606
03:59:27,280 --> 03:59:27,780
Sometimes.

5607
03:59:28,700 --> 03:59:29,360
That's okay.

5608
03:59:30,340 --> 03:59:31,200
I get it.

5609
03:59:31,300 --> 03:59:31,740
I get it.

5610
03:59:32,360 --> 03:59:33,940
Oh wait, where did I leave off on?

5611
03:59:34,140 --> 03:59:34,700
Oh, here we go.

5612
03:59:36,100 --> 03:59:36,880
Ria, thank you!

5613
03:59:37,620 --> 03:59:40,820
I don't have any money, but you can have the rest of this moon pie I'm eating.

5614
03:59:41,040 --> 03:59:42,640
Why did you send that card?

5615
03:59:45,740 --> 03:59:46,520
Misfits, thank you!

5616
03:59:47,840 --> 03:59:49,700
This game is a few years older than me.

5617
03:59:49,820 --> 03:59:51,300
But it's really timeless.

5618
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:53,560
Even if the hardest difficulties are so brutal.

5619
03:59:53,840 --> 03:59:55,100
Thank you for the fun, Mint.

5620
03:59:56,500 --> 03:59:57,120
I'm glad.

5621
03:59:57,980 --> 03:59:59,160
I'm glad that, uh...

5622
04:00:00,020 --> 04:00:01,660
Yeah, it really is timeless though.

5623
04:00:01,720 --> 04:00:02,200
It's so true.

5624
04:00:03,200 --> 04:00:04,280
Manthy Rose, thank you!

5625
04:00:04,440 --> 04:00:05,600
Such a joy to see you live.

5626
04:00:05,760 --> 04:00:08,900
I've started singing Snake Eater during my vocal practices because of you.

5627
04:00:09,160 --> 04:00:10,000
Oh my gosh.

5628
04:00:10,240 --> 04:00:11,760
You probably sound like...

5629
04:00:11,760 --> 04:00:13,500
You're probably insane levels then.

5630
04:00:14,100 --> 04:00:15,580
If that's your practice song.

5631
04:00:15,960 --> 04:00:16,780
Mia, thank you!

5632
04:00:20,680 --> 04:00:23,640
Pirate606, thank you!

5633
04:00:23,700 --> 04:00:25,460
I think you need a little bit more O's in your name.

5634
04:00:25,600 --> 04:00:26,440
Thank you so much.

5635
04:00:26,700 --> 04:00:27,100
Thank you.

5636
04:00:27,820 --> 04:00:28,620
Thank you!

5637
04:00:28,800 --> 04:00:29,740
Thank you!

5638
04:00:30,740 --> 04:00:31,180
Thank you!

5639
04:00:31,180 --> 04:00:31,260
Thank you!

5640
04:00:34,540 --> 04:00:35,340
I was...

5641
04:00:35,340 --> 04:00:37,140
Oh, I never played Zumbini's in my childhood.

5642
04:00:37,300 --> 04:00:39,200
But I was so obsessed with Gizmos and Gadgets.

5643
04:00:39,480 --> 04:00:40,680
I never played that either.

5644
04:00:42,020 --> 04:00:45,120
I didn't play so many kids games, I think.

5645
04:00:46,580 --> 04:00:48,120
I did do a lot of Neopets though.

5646
04:00:50,980 --> 04:00:53,760
It was amazing watching you get so excited to revisiting this.

5647
04:00:53,860 --> 04:00:55,720
Yeah, I haven't played it since I was a kid.

5648
04:00:55,920 --> 04:00:56,320
So...

5649
04:00:57,120 --> 04:00:57,280
It was awesome.

5650
04:00:57,660 --> 04:00:58,700
Mr. Fel, thank you!

5651
04:00:59,000 --> 04:00:59,840
Yulian, thank you!

5652
04:01:00,540 --> 04:01:02,100
TV Dinner Tray, thank you!

5653
04:01:02,860 --> 04:01:04,440
Looking forward to Podcast Monday.

5654
04:01:04,660 --> 04:01:05,840
Fly Highman, thank you so much!

5655
04:01:06,960 --> 04:01:07,920
David Titanium!

5656
04:01:08,160 --> 04:01:09,020
Pepe, thank you!

5657
04:01:12,260 --> 04:01:13,100
Virlet, thank you!

5658
04:01:13,660 --> 04:01:14,500
Nexidava, thank you!

5659
04:01:14,840 --> 04:01:15,600
Adonimous, thank you!

5660
04:01:15,940 --> 04:01:17,060
Airborne Ninja, thank you!

5661
04:01:17,620 --> 04:01:22,500
I got a scholarship from my local experimental aviation association to get my...

5662
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:23,480
Wait.

5663
04:01:24,420 --> 04:01:25,740
Experimental Aviation Association!

5664
04:01:26,200 --> 04:01:27,100
Aviation Association!

5665
04:01:27,440 --> 04:01:28,160
Aviation Association!

5666
04:01:28,500 --> 04:01:29,320
Aviation Association!

5667
04:01:29,720 --> 04:01:29,720
Aviation Association!

5668
04:01:30,020 --> 04:01:31,320
That sounds so awesome.

5669
04:01:32,200 --> 04:01:33,360
To get my license.

5670
04:01:33,560 --> 04:01:34,740
Might be something to look into.

5671
04:01:34,920 --> 04:01:41,520
It would be cheaper and easier for you to get the sport pilot license, which is mainly for ultralight planes or paragliders.

5672
04:01:42,160 --> 04:01:44,220
Okay, I'm actually going to look into that.

5673
04:01:46,540 --> 04:01:47,960
That sounds so awesome.

5674
04:01:52,360 --> 04:01:54,220
That are all the donations!

5675
04:01:54,580 --> 04:01:55,600
Thank you guys!

5676
04:01:55,860 --> 04:01:58,160
Thank you for sticking to the very end.

5677
04:01:58,280 --> 04:01:59,000
You didn't have to.

5678
04:01:59,280 --> 04:02:00,960
But I appreciate it so much.

5679
04:02:01,140 --> 04:02:05,000
I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day.

5680
04:02:05,100 --> 04:02:05,740
Or your night.

5681
04:02:05,980 --> 04:02:07,080
Or your morning.

5682
04:02:07,300 --> 04:02:07,820
Whatever.

5683
04:02:08,640 --> 04:02:10,960
I guess day would be appropriate there.

5684
04:02:11,980 --> 04:02:16,600
But I'm gonna go to the store and see if that cake that I want is there.

5685
04:02:16,800 --> 04:02:17,940
But I'm gonna go to the store and see if that cake that I want is there.

5686
04:02:17,940 --> 04:02:18,560
See you guys on Tuesday!

5687
04:02:19,360 --> 04:02:19,840
Tuesday!

5688
04:02:21,280 --> 04:02:22,240
Riko, thank you!

5689
04:02:22,700 --> 04:02:23,280
Thank you!

5690
04:02:24,680 --> 04:02:37,080
Most of the cost of a pilot's license is renting a plane for $150 to $250 per hour for the FAA mandated 40 hours of flight time.

5691
04:02:37,260 --> 04:02:40,000
Plus however much extra time is needed to pass the check ride.

5692
04:02:40,160 --> 04:02:42,500
If you already have access to a plane, the cost goes way down.

5693
04:02:42,680 --> 04:02:47,300
I'm gonna talk to my old boss and see if he would actually be willing to...

5694
04:02:47,940 --> 04:02:49,840
to teach...

5695
04:02:49,840 --> 04:02:51,080
Not teach me, but like...

5696
04:02:51,080 --> 04:02:55,900
Maybe I can shadow him and see what goes into flying a plane.

5697
04:02:57,520 --> 04:02:58,420
I'm gonna see.

5698
04:03:01,040 --> 04:03:01,900
Oh my gosh.

5699
04:03:01,960 --> 04:03:02,820
I'm gonna become...

5700
04:03:02,820 --> 04:03:05,060
I'm gonna become a pilot VTuber.

5701
04:03:07,380 --> 04:03:08,720
You wanna borrow my plane?

5702
04:03:08,940 --> 04:03:09,460
Is it okay?

5703
04:03:09,620 --> 04:03:10,640
Can I borrow your plane?

5704
04:03:12,940 --> 04:03:14,180
The webinars guy?

5705
04:03:15,180 --> 04:03:16,000
Thank you!

5706
04:03:16,060 --> 04:03:16,320
Thank you!

5707
04:03:19,860 --> 04:03:20,700
Rodrigo, thank you!

5708
04:03:20,760 --> 04:03:21,960
I was sick and missed the stream.

5709
04:03:22,060 --> 04:03:22,780
Feel better!

5710
04:03:23,180 --> 04:03:24,160
Feel better, feel better.

5711
04:03:25,000 --> 04:03:25,520
Alright.

5712
04:03:26,280 --> 04:03:27,060
Bye bye!

5713
04:03:27,580 --> 04:03:28,300
Bye bye!

5714
04:03:28,820 --> 04:03:29,320
Bye bye!

5715
04:03:30,240 --> 04:03:33,680
Have a nice trip!

5716
04:03:33,900 --> 04:03:35,740
My old boss and young lady!

5717
04:03:36,440 --> 04:03:37,100
Bye bye!

5718
04:03:37,720 --> 04:03:38,440
See you!

5719
04:03:40,640 --> 04:03:41,980
Oh, you can still hear me!

5720
04:03:42,800 --> 04:03:43,660
I forgot!

5721
04:03:46,020 --> 04:03:46,880
I forgot.

5722
04:03:47,940 --> 04:03:48,160
It's so loud!

5723
04:03:48,320 --> 04:03:48,980
I'm so sorry!

5724
04:03:49,160 --> 04:03:52,040
Oh, I forgot that I still had the mic on me.

5725
04:03:53,760 --> 04:03:54,200
Say

5726
04:04:02,480 --> 04:04:02,980
Otsu Minto!

5727
04:04:03,120 --> 04:04:03,980
I just said, itterashai!

5728
04:04:04,080 --> 04:04:04,900
Otsu Minto!

5729
04:04:05,760 --> 04:04:06,620
Otsu Minto!

5730
04:04:06,680 --> 04:04:07,320
Otsu Minto!

5731
04:04:08,180 --> 04:04:08,620
Otsu...

5732
04:04:09,640 --> 04:04:10,080
Minto!
