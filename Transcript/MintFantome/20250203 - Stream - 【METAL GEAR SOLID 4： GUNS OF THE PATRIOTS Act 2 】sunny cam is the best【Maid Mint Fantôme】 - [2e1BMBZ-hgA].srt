1
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,990
Welcome back, Master and Miss!

2
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,230
Hello, everybody.

3
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:34,670
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid 4!

4
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,290
Spooky number.

5
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,130
Lucky, lucky.

6
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,670
Evening, boss.

7
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,530
Evening.

8
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,170
Metal Gear.

9
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,810
Metal Gear.

10
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,550
Welcome back, welcome back.

11
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,950
Today we're doing Act 2 of Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.

12
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,910
What shenanigans shall we get into today?

13
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,890
Sorry, my... I'm very... like... today.

14
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,250
No!

15
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:16,950
Mew!

16
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,550
I had a dream I sent you my first rainbow super chat, so here you go.

17
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,930
Can I have a healing beam?

18
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,990
I'm sick!

19
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,890
Feel better!

20
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,710
Oh my gosh, Mew, don't, please don't.

21
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,350
Thank you!

22
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,850
Feel better, beam!

23
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,820
I'll send you lots of energy.

24
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Lots of moe magic!

25
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,200
Panic!

26
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
Thank you for the five gifts!

27
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,790
I feel like I'm still kind of getting over...

28
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,430
what I've... the boonkidus I had a while ago.

29
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,770
Thank you, Mew!

30
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,730
Letter M, letter I, letter N, letter T, letter O.

31
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,710
Mewto!

32
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,430
Boonkidus can take a while, give it time.

33
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,370
Yeah, it's really just like I have a...

34
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,350
It's just I have a cough still, but it's okay.

35
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,210
Darkray, thank you for the ten gifted!

36
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,230
Mew, thank you!

37
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,310
Oh gosh.

38
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,230
Rainbow N.

39
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,970
We had the I.

40
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,710
Wait a minute!

41
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,170
No!

42
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,190
Did I do yellow yet?

43
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,730
Yes, I did.

44
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,510
Yes, I did!

45
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,810
Love Mewto, no matter what flavor she is in.

46
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,910
Everybody was talking about Blue Mewto.

47
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,830
I did a... I was a caster, co-caster.

48
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,790
With Doki for...

49
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,690
Minecraft MOBA yesterday.

50
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:13,930
Mewto!

51
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,590
Thank you Mew!

52
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,670
Thank you for the rainbow!

53
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,630
Thank you.

54
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,370
And...

55
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,530
Everyone was just like, oh my gosh, why are you blue?

56
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,350
It's because...

57
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,090
They couldn't do chroma key very...

58
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,870
They couldn't figure it out very well.

59
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,730
Doki, thank you for the five gifted!

60
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,850
I don't know how I became blue.

61
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,330
But they couldn't figure it out very well.

62
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,030
I wasn't streaming... I wasn't doing anything, rather.

63
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,070
Like, everything was being handled on their side.

64
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,470
So, I was just kind of like...

65
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,330
Alright...

66
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,090
And I've turned blue!

67
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,010
So, we unlocked a new Mewto skin yesterday.

68
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:06,950
Maybe.

69
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,830
One you'll probably never see again.

70
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,710
And here goes, thanks for the 20 gifted!

71
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,990
Oh!

72
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,970
Just like how we got Otakons.

73
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,250
We did miss the briefings last time.

74
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,910
Maybe we should...

75
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,590
Maybe we should watch them this time.

76
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,430
Busy last time GS4 stream, but today you got my full attention!

77
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:31,830
Okay.

78
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,370
Game plus save, you can usually unlock hidden items via passwords in the extras menu.

79
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,370
Easily findable on GameFAQs.

80
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,270
Is GameFAQs still around?

81
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,110
Popo's Mewto.

82
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,030
Pepecore, thanks for the 5 gifted!

83
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,670
Blue Mewto is more Kusogaki than normal Mewto.

84
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,790
What!?

85
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,190
It literally is me!

86
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,990
It sure is.

87
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,310
Wow.

88
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,610
Wow.

89
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,090
Wow.

90
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,590
Wow.

91
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,230
GameFAQs will never die.

92
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,670
I guess so.

93
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,230
Extras, there was free DLC items.

94
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,870
Worth googling off stream.

95
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,210
Thank you!

96
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,130
Thanks Chikado.

97
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,030
Chikado.

98
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,230
Avocado.

99
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,310
Shall we do the vision briefing then?

100
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,590
And grab...

101
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,890
What's it called?

102
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,070
The... Oh wait.

103
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,630
It should work.

104
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,190
It should still let me pick which one, right?

105
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,410
Marco, thank you for the 5 gifted!

106
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,270
Thank you.

107
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,070
I hear she's pretty good.

108
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,710
Let's see.

109
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,070
So, okay, hold on.

110
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,930
I wanna explain something too before we start.

111
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,690
Because I made up a bit of an oopsie.

112
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,750
I, as you can see, we still have 287,200 Drebin points.

113
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,330
And I looked up the best places to farm Drebin points.

114
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,830
Because I was just like, oh yeah baby.

115
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,790
Let's get us some Drebin points so that we can get to 5 million.

116
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,670
Right?

117
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,950
Right?

118
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:22,820
And...

119
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,090
As you can see, we are starting Act 2.

120
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,630
We are at the Act 2 briefing.

121
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:30,810
Right?

122
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,970
But...

123
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,190
I looked it up and this place.

124
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,990
This place right here.

125
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,830
At the beginning of Act 2 is one of the best places to farm.

126
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:53,450
Because there's a frog unit girlies that drop really good to sell weapons in this spot.

127
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,770
And then...

128
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,030
Spoilers Minto.

129
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,210
I have to explain it.

130
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,070
I have to explain it.

131
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,070
But then...

132
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:12,250
The other places that are the best places to farm aren't until like Act 4 or 5.

133
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,850
So I would have to play until the end of the game.

134
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,910
Unless I do farming here.

135
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,830
So...

136
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,010
So...

137
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,470
Minto, Minto never changes.

138
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,910
She's always cute.

139
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,630
Stop it.

140
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,790
Cervantes, thank you for the super chat.

141
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,010
I played MGS3 and didn't actually play it for a year because Japanese games don't use the normal action key.

142
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,170
I thought it was broken.

143
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,590
I know what you mean, Panic.

144
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,550
It confuses me so much too because I feel like I'm constantly having to switch my brain.

145
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,230
I feel like I'm constantly having to switch my brain.

146
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,710
But anyway...

147
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,510
So...

148
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:05,190
I was like, oh my gosh, I can do like a membership stream and we just farm for a couple hours and see how much we get.

149
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,450
I didn't...

150
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,750
I completely dropped the ball.

151
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,450
I completely dropped the ball on doing that.

152
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,470
So...

153
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,990
I'm still gonna play Act 2 today.

154
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,390
But...

155
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm going to save on a different file.

156
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,990
So that...

157
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:40,970
In the middle of the week, I can go back and farm on stream.

158
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,810
And then...

159
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,130
And then I'll play through it again.

160
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,250
And then I will resume next week.

161
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,810
I'll resume next week.

162
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,490
Normal.

163
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,230
Oh my gosh, thank you guys for all the superchats!

164
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,230
Let's go EU friendly streaming time.

165
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,190
Crimson, thank you so much for a month of membership.

166
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,570
Like 10 superchats and I only use them on you.

167
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,130
Big love from Denmark.

168
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,430
Thank you, Salken!

169
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,510
Everyone in chat, farming stream sounds great.

170
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,310
Minto, I'm going to make my life harder for no reason.

171
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,070
I want to play the game!

172
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,330
I don't want to just farm today.

173
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,130
I want to...

174
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,130
Because then, next week we would have to play...

175
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,750
The whole Act 2.

176
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,920
How long do you need to farm?

177
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,360
I don't know!

178
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,680
I don't remember how much the weapons they drop or how much they sell for.

179
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,600
But it's...

180
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
They drop big money.

181
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,180
Not big, big money.

182
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Like it would probably still be a good amount of farming, I feel.

183
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,900
Try for a little bit to see how it goes.

184
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,100
Maybe, yeah.

185
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,140
Maybe we'll do that.

186
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:21,840
But...

187
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,700
But I...

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,780
I think this Act is already quite long.

189
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,840
I mean, they all are pretty long.

190
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,560
It also depends on how well I play.

191
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,600
I don't know!

192
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,800
I guess if you are a VOD watcher, you will potentially know how this goes.

193
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,740
I think.

194
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,740
Another month by the pinky!

195
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,660
Thank you!

196
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Also, D2R3K, thank you for the 5 gifted!

197
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,180
Farming stream, I love me some Story of Seasons.

198
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,240
Looking forward to Dystopian Militaries Farming Simulator 4.

199
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,700
Hello VOD watchers, how's the future like?

200
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,060
That's great!

201
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,260
They're watching...

202
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,680
They're watching Minky's stream.

203
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,620
Oh!

204
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,480
I also wanted to talk a little bit about...

205
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,420
Yesterday was Fuwamuko's birthday.

206
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,560
And one of the songs, Kanashimi Calibration.

207
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,820
There's a part in the middle where it's kind of quiet.

208
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,420
But it's not quiet because you hear a bunch of people yelling.

209
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,220
And I was one of those people yelling!

210
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,380
Yelling!

211
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,580
I can't believe they did Omyoji.

212
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,340
I can, because...

213
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,920
I mean, they started with Party Night.

214
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,940
Fuwamuko has amazing, amazing, amazing peak taste.

215
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,920
Obviously.

216
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,740
I was there!

217
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,700
Yeah, kind of.

218
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,600
They contacted me a couple months ago about it.

219
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,560
Actually, it's funny.

220
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,340
They asked if I could record it.

221
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,520
Me doing the mix, and I was just like, yeah!

222
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,700
They were like, if you don't have time to, you know, record...

223
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,800
If you are back in Japan soon, you can come to our studio.

224
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,360
I was like, oh my gosh, I almost went to the Hololive studio to record.

225
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,800
But luckily, I was recording that day, because I actually...

226
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,800
Or rather that week, I was recording...

227
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,380
I actually recorded me doing that the same day that I recorded Phantom Pain.

228
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,760
For Touhou Lost Word.

229
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,300
So I recorded all of Phantom Pain.

230
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,360
It took me like three hours, and then I was just like, okay, time to mix.

231
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,960
So it was all, same day!

232
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,100
And so I've been just kind of sitting on it, being so excited, because I love Kanashimi Calibration.

233
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:25,440
Honestly, I had to relearn the mix, because I was like, it's not a mix that you ever get to do, except outside that song.

234
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,360
And the group has disbanded a long, long time ago.

235
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,720
So...

236
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,920
No, they didn't do any Denpogumi songs.

237
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,900
But that's okay, they did a whole Denpogumi karaoke.

238
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,640
But yeah, so I just, you know, if you haven't watched their live yet, it was so...

239
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
I was crying so much.

240
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,960
I was like, oh my gosh, it was just such a...

241
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,580
It was like, oh my god.

242
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,800
It was...

243
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,600
You could really tell how much work they put into it, and...

244
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,860
I was so...

245
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,980
You know, obviously I was so honored that I could be even just a little fraction, a part of it.

246
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,020
But, oh my gosh, they're just so...

247
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,680
They're just such hard-working sisters.

248
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,000
I love them so much.

249
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,140
And...

250
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,740
Yeah, it's a really, really good show that they put on.

251
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,740
And it made me really motivated, too.

252
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,420
So, hopefully, you know, I can do a birthday live like that one day.

253
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:25,880
And...

254
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,500
Yeah, hard-working doggos, I know!

255
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,320
As soon as I saw the song, I was telling my Discord friends, I bet Mint is losing it right now.

256
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,640
And then you were in the song, and I was losing it instead!

257
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,420
I flipped your expectations!

258
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:43,940
But...

259
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,260
Found something interesting on Twitter regarding Metal Gear.

260
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,160
Someone was showing how to repair a little Metal Gear, and David Hater commented that he'd just keep destroying it!

261
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,020
Sasuga, David Hater.

262
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,180
He's so great.

263
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,560
I love how interactive he is with the fans.

264
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,260
And everybody... He still loves Metal Gear.

265
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,660
He's done so much!

266
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,220
That guy is literally, like, a crazy screenwriter.

267
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,380
And yet, he's still interacting with little ol' us.

268
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,720
Little ol' Metal Gear fans.

269
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,280
Lampy, thanks for the gifted!

270
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,500
I'd love to see y'all collab and just gush about idols.

271
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,860
That would be fun.

272
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,520
I just wanted to bring that up too, because it was yesterday.

273
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,900
Sorry, it's not related.

274
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,740
He loves talking about X-Men as well.

275
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,640
Yes, he does.

276
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,940
He loves bringing up scenes.

277
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,500
He's like, um, I wrote this scene.

278
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,760
And it's like, peak cinema.

279
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,280
And you're like, okay, genius.

280
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,800
Mr. Hater.

281
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,920
You're crazy.

282
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,780
Howdy howdy, Morning Minto.

283
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Howdy howdy.

284
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,400
Howdy howdy.

285
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,840
He's so cool.

286
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,920
He really is so cool, right?

287
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:01,780
Gosh.

288
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,380
Man!

289
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
Anyway, okay.

290
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,600
So, um, is this...

291
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,540
This is...

292
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,060
What did I click on?

293
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,240
Hold on, I'm just gonna load this.

294
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,880
Yes.

295
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,320
What did I load?

296
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,860
Okay.

297
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
Thanks for the stream, Minto.

298
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,320
Perfect background noise for my Foxhound rank attempt is negative.

299
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,000
Good luck, Briar.

300
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,100
One Liquid Sun mission briefing.

301
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,260
We didn't do it last week.

302
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,420
And let's get Campbell's face, right?

303
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,740
Let's steal his face.

304
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,960
We can watch it real quick.

305
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,260
Just a little recap, right?

306
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,780
Kind of a bit of a recap.

307
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,280
Of the story.

308
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,020
And the mission.

309
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,200
And everything.

310
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,500
Mission briefing.

311
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,180
But I won't do this every stream, obviously.

312
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,540
Time to lock in.

313
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,620
What?

314
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,360
We watched this one.

315
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,780
Sunny.

316
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,800
So quiet.

317
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,470
He's so colonel.

318
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,590
I once heard his voice in another video game.

319
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,130
And it's literally just like, I can't hear anyone else.

320
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,050
Wait a second.

321
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,730
Bears.

322
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:12,890
Teddy bears.

323
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,090
The framerate.

324
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,250
Ben 10 uncle, yeah!

325
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,330
Is he here?

326
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,470
Okay, good.

327
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,890
Look at little Mark 2.

328
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,410
Stop being mean to Sunny!

329
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,210
That's the worst part of this game, is they're so mean to Sunny.

330
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,450
Look at her, she's just like a maniac.

331
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,910
How's the audio by the way?

332
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,890
Eat the edge.

333
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,990
Throw it at them.

334
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,190
Look at her, she's about to lose it.

335
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,590
Naturex.

336
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,430
Nature protein.

337
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,650
Why does colonel look like that?

338
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,370
You're so mean to her!

339
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,510
I can't even concentrate on the conversation.

340
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,670
They're so mean to Sunny.

341
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,870
She has to walk up the steep stairs.

342
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,950
I'm gonna die so bad!

343
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,270
Oh my god, you're so horrible.

344
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,910
Eat the eggs!

345
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,950
This part is so sad.

346
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,350
Sunny!

347
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,340
Someone's in trouble.

348
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You go tell him Sunny.

349
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,420
Snake!

350
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,440
You were smoking again, weren't you?

351
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,140
This is a non-smoking play!

352
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,900
Stomp him.

353
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,060
Crush him.

354
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,140
Did we get the gold?

355
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,780
Tap him.

356
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,140
Cute.

357
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,720
So clumsy.

358
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,970
Bonk, grandpa.

359
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,010
How do I get to use it?

360
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,090
Let me use the robot.

361
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,790
Get in the robot, Minto.

362
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:40,970
Minto.

363
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,590
This is a good summary.

364
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,970
This is a good recap though.

365
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,430
Is Snake somehow older than Colonel?

366
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,410
It's an accelerated aging.

367
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,570
So he's numbers younger, but probably...

368
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,610
His body is older.

369
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:43,910
Sad.

370
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,650
Sad.

371
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,530
Nurse.

372
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,570
Perceptor and Ares Transformers.

373
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,110
Ride and jump scare.

374
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,050
He's got such big eyes.

375
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,110
He's just like, please sir, may I have some more gunpowder?

376
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,050
Please sir.

377
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,170
No way.

378
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,570
This is so awesome.

379
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,050
The logo is so awesome.

380
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,730
Wait, how do I select the button?

381
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,270
Come here Colonel.

382
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,420
Got it.

383
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,540
We got it.

384
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:44,940
I heard it.

385
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,090
Oh Snake.

386
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,210
Sunny!

387
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:04,690
Sunny!

388
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,370
Sunny!

389
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,410
Look at her go.

390
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,830
Oh sorry, here you go.

391
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:14,710
Now you can see her.

392
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,150
Oh Sunny!

393
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,890
She's being sneaky.

394
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,650
Am I in your way?

395
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,830
L2.

396
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:48,830
I see.

397
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,470
Is there anything else around here?

398
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,430
Chickens.

399
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,390
Where did the teddy bears come from?

400
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,470
They are so cute.

401
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,510
Nice.

402
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:36,810
Nice.

403
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,690
That's why you zoom around a little bit.

404
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,010
Cinema.

405
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,730
Solid as chicken.

406
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,150
Oh iPod.

407
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:56,930
That's right.

408
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,830
Do we have time to get it?

409
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,430
Let me out.

410
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,350
Oh my god.

411
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,250
Zoom in.

412
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:05,890
Ration.

413
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,170
Where is it?

414
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,010
Got it.

415
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,770
She looks like a cat.

416
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,550
What is she doing?

417
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,970
Ok, we'll go back to the scene now.

418
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,710
What's that picture of?

419
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,210
That one up there?

420
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,030
It's Olga.

421
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,290
It's Olga.

422
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,990
Ok Sunny.

423
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,710
What the?

424
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,410
I got Sunny's face.

425
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,050
It's a little freaky, isn't it?

426
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,830
Olga, do you have Metal Gear Solid 2?

427
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,710
Sunny again.

428
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,950
There we go.

429
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,810
Ok, so that's why we just did the last mission.

430
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,370
Rat Patrol.

431
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,330
They were sneaky.

432
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,190
Liquid's looking at you.

433
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,170
He's peeping.

434
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,230
I can vouch for them personally.

435
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,810
And we learned that it's Meryl and all then.

436
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,170
Johnny Meryl.

437
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,930
Oh, I didn't even realize she left.

438
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:16,750
Sunny, hold on.

439
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,730
Hold on.

440
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,150
There she goes.

441
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,890
This is quite the angle.

442
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,290
Sorry.

443
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:43,970
There she goes.

444
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,050
Up you go.

445
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,190
Will you terminate liquid?

446
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,470
Thank you, thank you.

447
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,920
Mint toy Oh my god.

448
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,180
The pixelated liquid.

449
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,500
He's so pixelated.

450
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,220
But if you're going to spark something, spark this.

451
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,340
Snake Even Colonel is like, come on man.

452
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,700
Spark this.

453
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,980
His joke flopped.

454
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,760
It's ok.

455
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,020
Snake is truly in his flop era in this game.

456
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,900
It's so sad.

457
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,960
Yay, we got Campbell.

458
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,520
Uh...

459
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,080
We didn't see that one.

460
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,060
Inori no Uta.

461
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,120
Oh, we got the other.

462
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,320
We got the Two Hand Princess.

463
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,320
Spoilers.

464
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,920
We got the spoilers.

465
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,100
Ok.

466
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,940
I guess you can't get Sunny then.

467
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,640
That's interesting.

468
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,260
Alright.

469
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,480
Alright.

470
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,300
Oh, not new game.

471
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,740
Are we ready to continue from where we last saved?

472
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,980
And... Act 2.

473
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,560
What is under extras?

474
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,540
I'm just curious because I don't know if I've ever opened this menu.

475
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,380
Oh, I gotta connect to the network.

476
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,860
I don't think my PlayStation is hooked up to... Hold on, let me see.

477
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,380
It's not.

478
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
But maybe next time we can see.

479
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,200
Okie dokie.

480
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,720
Alright.

481
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,100
Load game.

482
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,200
And... Yeah.

483
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,760
I don't know if even the servers are still on, but worth trying, I guess.

484
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,360
Do PS3s even support online anymore?

485
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,240
They do, yeah.

486
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,300
They do.

487
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,400
They did.

488
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,640
They did.

489
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,100
I mean, yeah, I played Peace Walker on here.

490
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,840
But I know that they just recently shut down the store, so...

491
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,420
I grabbed, like, all the LittleBigPlanet stuff.

492
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,660
Having a sleepy Sunday, so I might take a nap under this box and just listen to stream.

493
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,600
Have a nice nap.

494
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:34,510
If Peace Walker doesn't work on PlayStation, there's actually an alternative.

495
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:40,670
Because you can... The PlayStation one is... You know, you have to own it.

496
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,070
You have to already have it to be able to play it, but...

497
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:55,470
Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky...

498
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,290
Machi!

499
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,670
Happy early Metal Gear.

500
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,130
Happy birthday?

501
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,750
Of course!

502
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,250
Happy birthday!

503
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,190
Congratulations!

504
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,290
Happy birthday!

505
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:09,830
Resalutations!

506
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,110
Happy birthday!

507
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,030
May your sky stay blue!

508
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:20,810
Happy birthday to you, Machi the Rock!

509
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,010
Happy birthday!

510
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,550
Thank you for the Minky.

511
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,330
Yeah!

512
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,250
What was I going to say?

513
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:42,330
So, for Peace Walker, it's harder to play online with PlayStation because it's harder... It's more difficult to get the game.

514
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:49,090
But, the Xbox version, you can still buy Peace Walker on the Xbox.

515
00:39:50,970 --> 00:40:03,330
So, I think this time I might actually play the Xbox version because then I feel more people would be able to join in and play together.

516
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,910
I don't know if you can cross play.

517
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:09,870
I don't know.

518
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,470
I don't think so.

519
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,150
I don't think so.

520
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,150
So, we'll do Xbox.

521
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,450
We'll do Xbox this time.

522
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Solid Sun.

523
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,940
Lucky Ducky.

524
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,420
So, I think it's this area right here.

525
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,760
It's where you have to do the farming.

526
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,880
So, I guess I can maybe do a little bit of it or something.

527
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,560
I'm not sure.

528
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,460
We'll see.

529
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,660
We'll see how well I do.

530
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,840
Look how cute that is.

531
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,920
It's a guinea pig.

532
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,380
I wonder how it tastes.

533
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:21,960
Oh no.

534
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,620
Wait.

535
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,560
Someone's going to figure out how it tastes.

536
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,540
Oh my God.

537
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,900
Oh God.

538
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,760
Here we go.

539
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,180
We're going to see the cheeks baby.

540
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,000
I see.

541
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,580
Somehow making something unique for every gameplay you replay.

542
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,180
I appreciate that.

543
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,500
I want to just not have the same...

544
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,160
Solidus.

545
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,520
We can keep going.

546
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,760
Get more DP.

547
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,800
I feel that ruins the bit rate though.

548
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,520
Holy mountains.

549
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:21,720
Mountains.

550
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,400
Is this necessary?

551
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,560
Is this... Is this necessary?

552
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,180
Yes.

553
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,960
And no matter who wins, the world has no future.

554
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,160
Until we stop Liquid and destroy the system, we'll never be free.

555
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,400
Snake, what we call peace is an equilibrium kept in check by the war economy.

556
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,100
Destroying the system means wiping out the information society, the end of modern civilization.

557
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,620
Like it or not, we may have no choice but to protract the system.

558
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,560
Oh God.

559
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,980
Snake, here's what we know about the current battle.

560
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,660
Rebel guerrilla units are advancing on the base of the government PMC troops.

561
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,060
That base appears to be Liquid's safehouse.

562
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,820
According to Naomi's data, she's being held here inside the compound.

563
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,460
That's where she is.

564
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,620
Assuming the data is correct.

565
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,540
H-Worm crawling method really works for keeping quiet.

566
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,160
The camera is saying let's prove that Kojima cares about his fans.

567
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,140
My friends!

568
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,340
My friends!

569
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,460
I'll rescue them.

570
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,420
Don't worry, they'll live.

571
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,700
Yes, got it.

572
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,120
They're green.

573
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,180
They're my friends.

574
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,340
Green people, unite!

575
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,560
Green people!

576
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,460
This!

577
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,320
This!

578
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,200
The worst guy!

579
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,980
This part is so freaky.

580
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,700
That's weird.

581
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,400
But why is he called Vamp?

582
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:09,700
Vamp.

583
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,020
Vamp having his real bi-panic right here.

584
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,800
Laughing octopus.

585
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,130
She's just appealing to him the most.

586
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,770
Oh?

587
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,970
No!

588
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,550
No!

589
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,810
I don't have as big of boobs as you!

590
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,730
No!

591
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,180
I'm already here, baby.

592
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,040
Vamp.

593
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,060
Oh gosh, why do you...

594
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,140
We're so sneaky.

595
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,120
He smells me.

596
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,060
I think Snake the Light on your...

597
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,240
The solid eye is really not helping.

598
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,020
I'm not so sure they were looking at the face.

599
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,060
That's how I feel.

600
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,520
Beast.

601
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,240
She's a beauty and a beast.

602
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,880
Beauty and a beast.

603
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,580
Yeah, I think we should turn that off.

604
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,220
Tell Otacon to fix that.

605
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,960
Laughing.

606
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,700
The face of the man that killed your sister.

607
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,780
This guy is a pain in my butt.

608
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,300
Yeah!

609
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,020
Right, I know.

610
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,640
Oh, Mei Ling.

611
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,220
North.

612
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,040
Thank you.

613
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,860
Remember these boobas?

614
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,380
They are the boobas that killed your girlfriend.

615
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,220
Let's go, Mei Ling.

616
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,560
Chick booba.

617
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,540
She's amazing.

618
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:05,700
Laughing.

619
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,240
Snake, yeah.

620
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,220
You're in Snake.

621
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,780
Doesn't matter what age you are.

622
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,480
I mean, what?

623
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,980
Mei Ling was 16 during Shadow Moses, so...

624
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,660
Mei Ling gives me too many toys.

625
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,940
We have to go and find the Missouri.

626
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,500
Just like Mei Ling.

627
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,280
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she was 16.

628
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:44,680
Man.

629
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,100
The freak I just saw.

630
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,540
It's me!

631
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,860
I got mentioned!

632
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,740
I'm in the game!

633
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:57,460
Laughing.

634
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,420
Oh?

635
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,640
Sorry, I guess I should have told you.

636
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:25,300
Stay sharp.

637
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,380
16 to 19.

638
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,280
Now here is where...

639
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,560
We...

640
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,420
We are supposed to farm.

641
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,580
The issue is...

642
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,340
I'm just not quite sure.

643
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,060
I'm pretty sure it's here.

644
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,160
I'm sorry, guys.

645
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,340
I should have done more research.

646
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,020
They're just laying there!

647
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,440
Okay, I'm gonna try and save them.

648
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,420
Let's try and get our friends.

649
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,780
I should have probably... Okay, hold on.

650
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,040
I have to... Oh, I can't see anything.

651
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,440
Never mind.

652
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,440
Do you think if I...

653
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,060
No, you're down.

654
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:21,700
You're down!

655
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,080
No!

656
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,180
My friends!

657
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,320
No!

658
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,160
No!

659
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:38,860
My friends!

660
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,880
No!

661
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,620
My friends!

662
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:42,580
No!

663
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,250
My friends!

664
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:46,430
My friends!

665
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,390
My friends!

666
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,330
Are they still alive?

667
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:54,970
Is that my friend?

668
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:56,270
Are you my friend?

669
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,630
No.

670
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,070
I think I killed them.

671
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:01,590
Oh, shoot.

672
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,610
Good night.

673
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,010
Goodbye.

674
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,240
My friends!

675
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,520
Are they all dead?

676
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,360
Oh, man.

677
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,500
Oh, man.

678
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,640
I'm sorry, friends.

679
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:31,850
I'm sorry.

680
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,190
I didn't mean for this to happen.

681
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,670
I tried to save you.

682
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,830
I tried to put them to sleep.

683
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,650
Oh, my friends are dead.

684
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,370
I didn't let them die.

685
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,290
I mean, I tried.

686
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,730
I mean, they did die by my hand.

687
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,090
Oh, no.

688
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,390
They didn't die...

689
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,670
There's someone else.

690
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,530
The whole camp is asleep.

691
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:55,870
Can I take your weapon?

692
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:56,870
No, I can't.

693
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,310
They tried leaving.

694
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,390
I'm the worst!

695
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,070
What the hell?

696
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,330
How is this under here?

697
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:06,830
Hello?

698
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,290
Oh, I can't see anything.

699
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,790
I think there's one more guy over here or something.

700
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,850
What am I seeing on the map?

701
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,430
But he's not moving.

702
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,190
You should be on this boat.

703
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,170
There's snoring everywhere.

704
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,030
It's so funny.

705
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,230
Oh, that's good.

706
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,790
It's a good thing I...

707
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,970
Okay, I'm just gonna go...

708
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:41,430
Maybe?

709
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,810
What am I... Sorry, snake.

710
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,170
What is moving?

711
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,770
Is it a guy?

712
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,010
Sorry, I think the chat is kind of covering it up.

713
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,070
Let's go investigate.

714
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,060
The camera is not so great.

715
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:06,680
There we go.

716
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:12,640
What?

717
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,130
What am I seeing here?

718
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,970
I'm right on top of it.

719
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,080
Oh, there he is!

720
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,100
There he is.

721
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,500
Cute.

722
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,320
I owe thousands of taxes but we bought any Caesar 61.

723
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,180
No, Jonathan!

724
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,740
Oh my gosh.

725
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,460
Thank you, but no!

726
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,540
I can't see anything.

727
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,260
Hold on.

728
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,740
Night vision!

729
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,620
Can I get up here?

730
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,120
I saw that there was something up there.

731
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,360
How do I get up?

732
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,560
Jump up?

733
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,840
Nope.

734
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,320
Jump up.

735
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:15,960
Jump up.

736
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,020
Never mind.

737
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:17,980
I give up.

738
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,000
I can't see anything worse with this.

739
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,110
We need to go this way.

740
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,440
I'm running.

741
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,200
Thank you so much for the Akasupa, Jonathan!

742
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,540
I need Caesar 61.

743
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,440
I guess we'll just go.

744
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,680
Maybe this is not the location that I thought it was.

745
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,940
Maybe I am a fool.

746
00:55:59,070 --> 00:55:59,510
Come on!

747
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:00,350
Come on!

748
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,350
Come on!

749
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:01,990
Snake!

750
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,310
Grab it!

751
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:04,230
Snake!

752
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,610
Use your arms!

753
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,710
Holy moly, there is a guy right there.

754
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,770
Holy sh...

755
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:13,670
What?

756
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,010
Oh.

757
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:14,730
What?

758
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:15,090
What?

759
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:16,210
Nothing?

760
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:18,210
Nothing.

761
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:19,350
Where are you?

762
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:20,810
Who is what?

763
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:21,610
Who is me?

764
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,450
Me?

765
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,230
Oh my gosh.

766
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,850
Gosh, you scared me!

767
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,010
The guy is totally seeing things.

768
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:32,410
Crazy.

769
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:35,090
Hold on.

770
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:35,870
I got to use it.

771
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:37,510
Crazy.

772
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:41,510
Oh my gosh, it's Sunday so everything is 20% off.

773
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,590
I forgot.

774
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,890
I think Sunday and Wednesday is right.

775
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,270
Let's go.

776
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,650
Wait.

777
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:50,250
Hold on.

778
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:51,310
Trebin Shop.

779
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,630
How much is it?

780
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,870
The expensive...

781
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:57,010
Oh.

782
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:01,570
Oh.

783
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,350
So guys, what we are trying to save up for is...

784
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,250
Oh, it's only 4 million today!

785
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:14,030
It's only 4 million today!

786
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,130
We could get it.

787
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,390
We can do this.

788
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:24,630
4 million is actually a lot better than 5 million.

789
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:29,770
Yeah.

790
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,350
Can I get up here?

791
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,150
Can I now get up here?

792
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,070
There you go snake.

793
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,130
We want the bomb.

794
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,210
Oh my god!

795
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,300
Let's just save.

796
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,430
I hear more people.

797
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,800
Why are there so many people all of a sudden?

798
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,800
Where did they come from?

799
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,220
Where did they come from?

800
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,300
Who is firing?

801
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:17,940
Are those my friends?

802
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:27,750
My friends?

803
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:28,630
Are here?

804
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:29,910
Probably?

805
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,190
Where?

806
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,970
Where is everybody?

807
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,850
There is so much action happening around me and I don't know where...

808
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,190
Oh here they are.

809
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,170
My bad.

810
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,250
Oh that's a bad guy.

811
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:51,990
Oh shoot.

812
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,350
Dang it.

813
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,330
You're welcome.

814
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,850
Are my friends still alive?

815
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:01,430
Oh shoot.

816
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:02,950
Ah!

817
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,240
What?

818
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,060
You!

819
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,200
Literally you!

820
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:12,880
You!

821
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,640
No HQ!

822
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,700
Oh my god.

823
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,840
You had a whole army attacking and now you are going to send reinforcements.

824
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,360
Are you a friend?

825
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,830
Are you a friend?

826
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,730
It looks like it's green.

827
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:34,210
Are you not a friend?

828
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,970
Why are you green if you are a friend?

829
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,630
Sleep.

830
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,350
The red name is hostile.

831
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,230
Nevermind.

832
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:04,910
Don't wake up.

833
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:05,730
Oh shoot.

834
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,390
The leaf?

835
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:10,530
Oh no.

836
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,190
Oh no!

837
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:11,970
We are in a loop!

838
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:13,830
We are in a triangle loop!

839
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,150
We are in a triangle loop!

840
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:16,910
Oh no!

841
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,250
Oh no!

842
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,290
I can do this.

843
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:41,990
Get the ammo.

844
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,350
Get the ammo?

845
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:45,810
Get the ammo.

846
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,490
Get the ammo, Snake.

847
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,070
Snake, get the ammo.

848
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:51,990
Why can't I get the ammo?

849
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:55,810
Snake, get the ammo.

850
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:57,550
Get the ammo, Snake.

851
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,310
Snake?

852
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:02,410
Oh I'm full.

853
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,490
Now it tells me.

854
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:05,610
Okay.

855
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,570
Gosh, I love grass view.

856
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,550
Don't you guys love it too?

857
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,150
The caution will go away eventually.

858
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:23,870
But they shot after all those people.

859
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,970
And now suddenly they are like...

860
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,250
Now declare caution.

861
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,110
I can't see anything.

862
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,450
Now I can see a little bit.

863
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,610
Come in!

864
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,330
The triangle loop is basically juggling for the viewers.

865
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,330
I can't see anything.

866
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:48,910
Okay Snake, get out of here.

867
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,830
I still can't see anything.

868
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:56,910
Okay, there is that guy.

869
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,080
Hey buddy.

870
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,140
Nice.

871
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:06,760
We are

872
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,100
just going to be...

873
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,180
Snake, you are just going to have to get over your old man-ness.

874
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,060
I'm sorry.

875
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,340
Who just woke up?

876
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,760
Who just woke up?

877
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,140
Hello, where are you?

878
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,180
Sleepy?

879
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,740
His snoring is so loud.

880
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,120
Get up.

881
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:41,660
Get up.

882
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,320
Go, Snake.

883
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,340
And go.

884
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:43,940
Nice.

885
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:45,680
I'm full.

886
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,410
Can I...

887
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,130
Climb here?

888
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,930
I think if I...

889
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:01,610
No, okay.

890
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:02,690
That's fine.

891
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:05,950
This is okay.

892
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,610
Everything is fine-ish.

893
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,910
Oh my God.

894
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,610
It's like the tiniest little hole ever.

895
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,450
Damn it!

896
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,010
The bushes gave me away.

897
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,390
How do I get up here?

898
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,160
Laughing Snake.

899
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,440
Who is laughing here?

900
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,300
Nobody is laughing.

901
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,180
Nobody is laughing here.

902
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,360
Oh my God.

903
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,380
Oh my gosh!

904
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,100
My friends!

905
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,200
Question mark?

906
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:56,870
Do you think they will come down here?

907
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,850
There is a whole lot of people walking around.

908
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,330
Hello.

909
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:04,550
No.

910
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:05,730
Maybe?

911
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,380
How do I jump?

912
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,620
Snake sometimes just doesn't want to use his arms.

913
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,980
He is too used to being a T-Rex.

914
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,480
Look at them.

915
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,280
Look at them wander.

916
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,380
They don't even know I'm here.

917
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,040
They don't even know.

918
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,220
They don't even know.

919
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,240
Snake, I'm gonna need you to like lift up though.

920
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,280
For real.

921
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,040
And goodbye.

922
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,340
Understood.

923
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,520
The state of alert has been lifted.

924
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,380
Resume position.

925
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:47,260
Bye!

926
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:48,640
Bye!

927
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,220
Bye!

928
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,860
This guy though.

929
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,900
Is he gonna come over here?

930
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,280
Please don't see me.

931
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,100
My camera is at 75%.

932
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,020
Maybe he turned around.

933
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,260
Turn around.

934
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,340
Turn around.

935
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,960
Turn around.

936
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,340
Yeah.

937
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,960
That's what I thought.

938
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,400
Can I get you?

939
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,260
I think he comes over here, right?

940
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:35,510
Come here.

941
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:35,730
Come here.

942
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:35,970
Come here.

943
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:36,810
Yeah, you get him.

944
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,070
Ok, we are back in the loop.

945
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,250
But like, I think this is manageable.

946
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,030
Right?

947
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:45,770
Ok, he's really taking the long way.

948
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,070
Don't get him up.

949
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:50,470
Nice.

950
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,830
Wait, did he kick him up?

951
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:53,310
Ok.

952
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:54,610
Ok.

953
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,050
Snake, go up.

954
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,130
Snake, use your arms.

955
01:05:58,350 --> 01:05:58,710
Snake.

956
01:05:59,110 --> 01:05:59,930
No, Snake.

957
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:01,210
Snake, use your arms.

958
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:01,990
No, Snake.

959
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:02,630
Snake.

960
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:03,710
Snake.

961
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:05,990
Snake.

962
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,070
Snake.

963
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:09,510
Snake, lift.

964
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:10,510
Lift.

965
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:11,470
There we go.

966
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:12,510
Ok, buddy.

967
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:12,970
Good job.

968
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:14,770
Ok, lift.

969
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:15,710
Ok.

970
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,430
Oh, there is another guy up there.

971
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,820
I think I got him.

972
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,680
No, I don't trust the grass.

973
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,520
Oh my god.

974
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,240
That was close.

975
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:29,880
There we go.

976
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,060
Lift.

977
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:33,260
No, lift.

978
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:36,940
Ok.

979
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,640
We're...

980
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,340
Is there stairs or something for my old man?

981
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,000
Please.

982
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,420
Snake, lift up.

983
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,000
No.

984
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,260
Lift.

985
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,800
Snake, you can't touch that.

986
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:55,500
It's barbed wire.

987
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,640
Snake, we are trapped.

988
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,780
This is... This is here.

989
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:03,680
No.

990
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,080
He needs an escalator.

991
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:06,460
True.

992
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:07,900
Snake.

993
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:18,680
Wait.

994
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,560
Oh, I found it.

995
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:21,960
I found it.

996
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:22,960
I'm a genius.

997
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,060
Good job.

998
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,400
Up here.

999
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,580
And up.

1000
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,100
Good job, Snake.

1001
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:31,680
Good job.

1002
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,820
Where is your weapon?

1003
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,220
Game is over.

1004
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:42,460
Lift.

1005
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,580
No, not here.

1006
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,820
Over here.

1007
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,400
Over here.

1008
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,760
He needs the tiniest steps everybody.

1009
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,620
Please understand.

1010
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:53,460
Do you have a weapon?

1011
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,580
You don't even have anything.

1012
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,460
Why was I... Why am I worried about you?

1013
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,160
He is so old.

1014
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,400
How much did I miss?

1015
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,800
Not really anything at all.

1016
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,060
Oh God.

1017
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,180
Oh good.

1018
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,420
Psychological counselor.

1019
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,260
Clearly they are a good person then.

1020
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:27,320
Oh she.

1021
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:31,740
She.

1022
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,930
Hello Rosemary.

1023
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:48,270
She used to work as a data analyst at the Pentagon.

1024
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:57,190
Even he says Jack.

1025
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,150
Excuse me?

1026
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:01,030
Call him by his name.

1027
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:03,890
But he wants to be called Raiden.

1028
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:42,010
147.79 147.79

1029
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,750
He looks like he is in Psycho Mantis' room.

1030
01:09:53,370 --> 01:10:01,830
Couldn't you have found a better time to tell me about this?

1031
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:17,130
Dun dun!

1032
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,970
He's like who?

1033
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,030
Jack?

1034
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:29,350
I couldn't even...

1035
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,310
That's so sassy.

1036
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:46,630
Oh!

1037
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:01,390
Roy Campbell you...

1038
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,290
Oof.

1039
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:22,010
Yeah Roy's psychic gauge is going down.

1040
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:34,170
Campbell is a freak.

1041
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,060
I hate this.

1042
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:37,230
So bad.

1043
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,250
Oh.

1044
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,170
Happy birthday.

1045
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:45,470
I'll sing you happy birthday after this.

1046
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:46,610
A criminal.

1047
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,850
What a mess.

1048
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,330
Holy moly.

1049
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,650
Happy birthday to you.

1050
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:12,290
Happy birthday to you.

1051
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:15,270
Happy birthday Jack Barfoot.

1052
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:21,210
Happy birthday to you.

1053
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:23,590
Happy birthday!

1054
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:25,870
Thanks for the superchat.

1055
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,790
Look at all the little guys.

1056
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,690
My friends!

1057
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,950
My friends, my friends.

1058
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,570
We are here.

1059
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:35,810
I'm here with you.

1060
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:37,930
Hello friend.

1061
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:38,850
Hello.

1062
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:39,790
Hello.

1063
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:40,730
Hello.

1064
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:41,390
Oh sorry.

1065
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:42,910
Hi!

1066
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,870
Hello friends.

1067
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:48,670
It's me again.

1068
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,390
Oh sorry.

1069
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,010
Hello.

1070
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:54,470
I'll help you.

1071
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:56,450
I won't let you die.

1072
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:58,990
I'm gonna help you.

1073
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,830
Oh shoot.

1074
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:01,730
Shoot.

1075
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,530
Shoot.

1076
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:03,570
Shoot.

1077
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:04,610
Shoot.

1078
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:05,870
Where is he coming from?

1079
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:09,490
Oh shoot.

1080
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,150
No!

1081
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:12,410
No!

1082
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:13,910
No!

1083
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:15,270
No!

1084
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,030
Yeah I'm good.

1085
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,230
I saved you.

1086
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:25,750
You're welcome.

1087
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:28,550
Where?

1088
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:29,390
You need backup?

1089
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:30,050
Hold on.

1090
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,630
Let me get my money.

1091
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:31,730
Oh shoot.

1092
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,870
I got his ass.

1093
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:35,130
Oh shoot.

1094
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:36,190
I got his ass.

1095
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,130
I got his ass.

1096
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,890
I got his butt.

1097
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:40,790
I got him.

1098
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,010
Get me at him.

1099
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:45,450
Oh more?

1100
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:46,250
More of them?

1101
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:47,550
Uh oh.

1102
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:48,310
Ouch!

1103
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,910
I thought they were gonna spot me.

1104
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:50,910
I was worried for a second.

1105
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,490
Where are you?

1106
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,050
There you are.

1107
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,810
Oh I just realized my...

1108
01:13:58,810 --> 01:13:58,810
shoot.

1109
01:13:59,490 --> 01:13:59,890
Get over.

1110
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:00,370
There you go.

1111
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:02,330
There we go.

1112
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,370
Nice.

1113
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:05,770
Reload.

1114
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:08,670
My friends!

1115
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:10,630
Everybody is asleep.

1116
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,340
Nice.

1117
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,440
Where is my friend?

1118
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:19,560
They all lived right?

1119
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:20,660
Nobody died?

1120
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:21,800
Everybody is alive?

1121
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:23,100
Everybody is good?

1122
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,140
I got a new gun.

1123
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,320
I saw something over here.

1124
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:34,360
I thought...

1125
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,020
Friends!

1126
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:36,720
There they are.

1127
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,380
There is my friends.

1128
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,920
They are covering me?

1129
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:40,760
I'm covering them.

1130
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,520
Are there only two of us left?

1131
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:46,840
Sorry.

1132
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,320
I don't mean to intrude.

1133
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,460
Oh god.

1134
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:50,920
Baddy.

1135
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:51,680
Bad man.

1136
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,540
I got him.

1137
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:55,880
Don't worry.

1138
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,360
The music was so scary for two seconds.

1139
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,240
What's in here?

1140
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:06,540
More ammo.

1141
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,060
I think we are okay.

1142
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,260
It was like a horror game for two seconds.

1143
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,420
It's kind of funny.

1144
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,580
My camo is not very good.

1145
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,220
Is that my friend here?

1146
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,640
No, that is not my friend.

1147
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:35,570
Shit!

1148
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:36,770
Shit!

1149
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,870
God!

1150
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,970
Shut up!

1151
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:43,590
Please!

1152
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:49,990
I think I saw a guy over there.

1153
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:53,390
Nope, that's a flower.

1154
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:55,990
That's my friend!

1155
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,110
Hey friend!

1156
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,190
Is it only just you left?

1157
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:02,150
No.

1158
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,750
There was one other guy.

1159
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,610
What happened to him?

1160
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:07,770
Uh oh.

1161
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,690
I don't think you should go by yourself buddy.

1162
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,190
I'm coming with you.

1163
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:13,150
Singular friend.

1164
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:15,130
Friend!

1165
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:16,850
Friend!

1166
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:24,830
Will you ever attempt a no kill, no alert run of any of the MGS games?

1167
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,070
I honestly...

1168
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:34,870
don't have any intentions because...

1169
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:38,770
To me, I don't care about the stealth.

1170
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:42,130
The only real game that I like the gameplay of is Five.

1171
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:49,030
So it's kind of more like I love Metal Gear Story, but the gameplay for me is just kind of like...

1172
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,130
not anything that I truly am like...

1173
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:53,490
wanting to master if you get what I mean.

1174
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,490
Who is breathing in my ear?

1175
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:05,510
Oh my god.

1176
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:19,950
I'm at your side.

1177
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:24,210
I know that nerdy nerd voice anywhere.

1178
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,130
Hello friends.

1179
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,550
I'm gonna be helping you guys too.

1180
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:36,570
No!

1181
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,130
It's an ambush!

1182
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:38,750
Don't do it!

1183
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:39,610
Don't do it.

1184
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,330
It's an ambush.

1185
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,090
Don't go!

1186
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:42,690
Don't go!

1187
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:44,910
OK.

1188
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:46,270
Don't listen to Minto.

1189
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,830
Hello friend.

1190
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,210
Oh my god.

1191
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:57,850
Where are they coming from?

1192
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:02,470
I see him.

1193
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,090
OK.

1194
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,330
OK.

1195
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:07,070
Sorry friends.

1196
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,010
You are maybe on your own this time.

1197
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:11,410
Hello?

1198
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,470
I couldn't even see where he was.

1199
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,390
They won't see me in the grass.

1200
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:24,670
My stress is high.

1201
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:27,210
Oh my god.

1202
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:28,050
Friend!

1203
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,130
I'm sorry.

1204
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:32,390
I'll sell your goods and make good profit.

1205
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:36,470
I won't let your money go to vain.

1206
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:37,610
What?

1207
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,450
Who saw me?

1208
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,050
Where?

1209
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:40,570
Who the hell saw me?

1210
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:41,530
No way.

1211
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,940
They were talking about me, right?

1212
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,500
That's a little high.

1213
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,600
My stress is climbing.

1214
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,700
I need the hot... I mean hot lady.

1215
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,740
I need to speak to a hot woman.

1216
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,480
Oh my god.

1217
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,760
There is a lot of bloodshed here.

1218
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,200
I'm backing you up.

1219
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,120
Don't worry.

1220
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:08,760
I got you.

1221
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,640
Is this a good place for...

1222
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,780
Is this a good place for...

1223
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,840
For tranquilizer?

1224
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,460
I can't see if you do that.

1225
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,600
I'm backing you up.

1226
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,220
I'm out of ammo!

1227
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,860
I need to buy more stuff.

1228
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,200
Wait, what gun am I using?

1229
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,000
Mark 2 pistol.

1230
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,920
I'm out of ammo.

1231
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,060
Is there an ammo... Bullets.

1232
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,020
Oh wait.

1233
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,380
Do these work?

1234
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,780
These do work.

1235
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,260
We can make them cry.

1236
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,120
They are a little expensive though.

1237
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:06,960
But it might be cool to use.

1238
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,680
Let's try it.

1239
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,800
Make them cry.

1240
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,860
Make them... Oh no.

1241
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,460
Oh my goodness.

1242
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,140
Imagine if I just wasted all my money.

1243
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:19,490
Let's try it.

1244
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,230
Oh yeah, I do have a sniper.

1245
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,890
Actually, did I put it in my... I did not.

1246
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:24,670
Hold on.

1247
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,530
I do have a...

1248
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,530
Get rid of...

1249
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:32,930
You.

1250
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:36,010
Where is our... Not handgun.

1251
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:38,050
Here we go.

1252
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:39,890
Yeah, put you in.

1253
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:43,860
Thanks.

1254
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,280
Is this the Krusty Krab?

1255
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,980
No, this is Raiden.

1256
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,880
There is nobody else here.

1257
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,140
Who are you shooting at?

1258
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,080
Oh, they just come walking on in.

1259
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,420
I'm backing you up.

1260
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,240
You're welcome.

1261
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,920
I still feel like this would do some big damage, you know?

1262
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,860
The music is kind of awesome.

1263
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,980
Take their money.

1264
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,640
Hold on.

1265
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:30,040
Hold on.

1266
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:30,800
I got you.

1267
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:31,760
I got you.

1268
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,780
I didn't really, but...

1269
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,300
No, they are charging.

1270
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,080
Oh, there is a guy up there.

1271
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,120
They are

1272
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,840
coming in.

1273
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:46,680
Maybe.

1274
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,140
I'm gonna grab their money.

1275
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:56,790
We are getting a place.

1276
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:57,790
Aren't we?

1277
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:00,310
There are so many asleep men.

1278
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:02,510
I wonder...

1279
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,570
Where is he?

1280
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:07,030
Oh, damn.

1281
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:09,710
That would have been good.

1282
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:12,170
Are you kidding me?

1283
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,770
Hold on!

1284
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,390
These are all the enemy.

1285
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,290
Are they not?

1286
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,650
I just got that guy's leg.

1287
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,330
Everybody is the enemy.

1288
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:30,970
I'm not the only enemy.

1289
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:34,410
I'm not the only enemy here.

1290
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:35,070
Oh my gosh.

1291
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:35,650
I got you.

1292
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,300
Maybe I should be killing these guys.

1293
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,080
Oh my God.

1294
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,200
I can't see anything.

1295
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:43,780
Oh, he's down.

1296
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:46,520
No, I'm getting everywhere.

1297
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,280
I'm getting their money.

1298
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,220
OK.

1299
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,340
Grab their money.

1300
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,280
Who else's money is around?

1301
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,040
Hello.

1302
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,620
I'm backing you up.

1303
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,160
I'm behind you.

1304
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,220
I see more money over here.

1305
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,120
Oh, it's rations.

1306
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,580
My stress is a little high.

1307
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,640
You OK, Snake?

1308
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,780
Oh, I have full rations.

1309
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:11,600
Let's go.

1310
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,360
Back me up.

1311
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,100
I got you.

1312
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,700
Sniper Legend!

1313
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,840
Did I get him?

1314
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,940
Sniper Legend!

1315
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,300
Sniper Legend!

1316
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,260
Sniper Legend!

1317
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:36,860
Minky!

1318
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,400
I don't have any...Oh, I do have Pizazz's Ammo, but I just...

1319
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,540
You're welcome!

1320
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,460
Gold mine!

1321
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:57,490
Oh my gosh.

1322
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:00,850
Is this what they meant by...Oh, I can't see anything.

1323
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,460
No, stop moving!

1324
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,120
Stop moving!

1325
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:10,940
Hold on.

1326
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,280
There's a treasure trove.

1327
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:15,180
Nice.

1328
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:18,420
Charge!

1329
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:22,580
Baby!

1330
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:24,420
Charge!

1331
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:24,560
Charge!

1332
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:29,720
I'm just taking...I wish I could take the money.

1333
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,220
Damn!

1334
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:35,220
Holy moly!

1335
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,180
I don't think I need this anymore.

1336
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,080
I'm fighting with my friends!

1337
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,160
We're doing a good thing!

1338
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,060
Oh, I know what...Oh, that's right.

1339
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:54,940
I have no more...

1340
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,900
Wait, should I not have...Let's hold on.

1341
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,480
Press the O button to change the type of ammo.

1342
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,400
Oh, cry!

1343
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:03,920
There we go.

1344
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,400
Alright, time to cry!

1345
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:07,820
Just kidding.

1346
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:09,060
Cry!

1347
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:17,380
It's because my hand is so unsteady because of my...

1348
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,980
Because of my stress level.

1349
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:35,790
OK, I guess I'll leave.

1350
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,830
Bye friends!

1351
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:40,550
Good luck!

1352
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:42,790
Oh my god, they're so noisy!

1353
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:46,530
They're so noisy!

1354
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:49,990
What the...Hold on.

1355
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,290
Oh gosh.

1356
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:53,810
Sorry.

1357
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:55,530
I had a phone call.

1358
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:57,770
Psych!

1359
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:58,750
You don't know where to go?

1360
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:00,530
I'm working on it.

1361
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:02,770
Oh my gosh.

1362
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:03,650
Oh!

1363
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,990
Wait, are those my friends or...

1364
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,130
Oh yeah, they're my friends.

1365
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:08,510
Holy shoot!

1366
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,550
Don't make them cry.

1367
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:17,610
Don't worry about me, friends!

1368
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:18,870
I'm a friend!

1369
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:22,750
Don't worry about me, friends!

1370
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:27,250
I don't think there's any other...I can't tell actually.

1371
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:30,090
I honestly can't tell who's baddie and who's good.

1372
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:33,030
I can't tell who's my buddies!

1373
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,870
Get in your box.

1374
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:37,670
Oh I could!

1375
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,410
Can I get in here?

1376
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,230
Anybody in here actually?

1377
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:43,890
Hello?

1378
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:47,490
Oh my god.

1379
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:48,370
Oh gosh!

1380
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:50,830
That scared the hell out of me!

1381
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,090
I'm leaving.

1382
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:54,750
Bye bye!

1383
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,390
I'm just a ghost maid!

1384
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:04,950
Keep me out of this!

1385
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,290
You think they'll see me?

1386
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:10,570
Where are they anyway?

1387
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:11,870
Oh there they are!

1388
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:13,710
That was so close!

1389
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,650
Not me!

1390
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,130
You don't see me!

1391
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,070
Oh my gosh, my hand is so unsteady.

1392
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,430
But you're okay, Snake!

1393
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:29,870
Baby!

1394
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:31,110
Little baby.

1395
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,080
He's on all fours crying!

1396
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,440
Where did that other guy go?

1397
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,540
Oh damn!

1398
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,280
They killed him!

1399
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:49,790
I didn't do that.

1400
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,970
Oh shoot.

1401
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:52,310
Damn it!

1402
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:53,530
These were expensive.

1403
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:54,950
There you go.

1404
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:55,150
No!

1405
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,020
Missile launcher!

1406
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,480
How do I get in there?

1407
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,860
You alright, Snake?

1408
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,080
Let's talk to a sexy lady.

1409
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,320
Oh shoot.

1410
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,220
Guys, what was Rose's...

1411
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,100
There's a baddie in the bottom right corner.

1412
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,200
Oh wait, I was winking but you couldn't tell.

1413
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,320
What's her codec again?

1414
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,060
Oh there it is!

1415
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:35,560
Just kidding.

1416
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,000
Rosemary!

1417
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,520
You just said that.

1418
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,020
Moonya!

1419
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,280
Moonya.

1420
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:13,200
I don't think...my controller is 6 axis.

1421
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:14,900
Sorry.

1422
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:18,420
Time to blow what what?

1423
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:21,800
Wait, wait, wait!

1424
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,120
Can I get everything inside first?

1425
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:24,280
What do you mean?

1426
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,180
Destroy the facility.

1427
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,920
What do you mean by that?

1428
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,140
Wait, can I get this?

1429
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:29,760
Oh my rations are full.

1430
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:30,400
Grenade!

1431
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:32,560
I can't see!

1432
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,220
That was close.

1433
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,420
You guys, I'm right here!

1434
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:51,630
Wait!

1435
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,810
No, my friend!

1436
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:03,620
Hello!

1437
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,640
Excuse me!

1438
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:05,700
I'm right here!

1439
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,400
Oh my god!

1440
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,420
Please be careful!

1441
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,160
Oh, sorry friend!

1442
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:12,920
Sorry!

1443
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:13,980
Sorry!

1444
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,260
He doesn't like me very much.

1445
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,600
Maybe we can go around.

1446
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,550
Oh, sorry Snake.

1447
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:26,390
He got really dizzy from that.

1448
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:26,850
Are you OK?

1449
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:29,490
Oh my god Snake, I'm so sorry.

1450
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,850
I just did a victory!

1451
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:40,310
I did a victory roll and he couldn't handle it.

1452
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,980
We're fine.

1453
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,260
Maybe it will work.

1454
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,080
If I can do that...I don't know.

1455
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,980
Yeah, I know you can shake it to make her boobs move.

1456
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,700
Peak gaming.

1457
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,220
Damn it monkey!

1458
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,860
No, you shouldn't be smoking monkey!

1459
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,920
Who taught you that?

1460
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,840
Actually...eat that Snake.

1461
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,660
I have you.

1462
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,760
No,

1463
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,440
we just won actually.

1464
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:45,760
We're so good at this.

1465
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,820
No smoking on board!

1466
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,960
Our addict monkey.

1467
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:58,000
He's addicted to caffeine and cigarettes.

1468
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,040
Little monkey chair.

1469
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,500
Especially in the CIA.

1470
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,520
Monkey is just like me.

1471
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,470
Chill, chill monkey.

1472
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:41,150
What's going on?

1473
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:44,730
We're trying to be secretive here.

1474
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:49,870
It doesn't help if your door is wide open.

1475
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:52,130
Oh boy.

1476
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:52,790
Oh, sorry.

1477
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:54,830
Where are they?

1478
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:03,330
Beauty and the Beast baby!

1479
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:17,870
Why do you say it like that?

1480
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,410
Why do you say it like that Snake?

1481
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:28,650
A lady on the field.

1482
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:51,650
Psyche go down.

1483
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,410
We didn't have anymore to go down.

1484
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:59,730
Our stress is...

1485
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:02,890
Our psyche is so low that we didn't even have...

1486
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:05,670
You can't hurt me anymore than I've already been.

1487
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:17,990
He just accepts it.

1488
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:20,270
You can't hurt me Dribbin.

1489
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:22,270
I hate myself the most.

1490
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:51,170
War transforms a snake...

1491
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,390
Into beasts.

1492
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:57,430
They're tragic backstories.

1493
01:34:58,330 --> 01:35:00,250
Dribbin Wikipedia over here.

1494
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:08,490
War transforms us.

1495
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,810
But deep within that shell, something human survives.

1496
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,490
A fragile and solid heart.

1497
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:21,830
Without a shell to protect it, it's like the yolk of an egg.

1498
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:30,310
Word going round is that natural flesh and blood bodies can't survive in the open for more than a few minutes.

1499
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:37,650
And they've been convinced that by killing Snake, their minds will be cleansed.

1500
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:43,210
They think it's going to free them from all the pain and all the fury.

1501
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:44,630
And what did Snake do?

1502
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:44,770
Cool.

1503
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:54,910
Maybe... Obsessed... With killing me this time?

1504
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:04,930
Crying wolf.

1505
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:13,530
Screaming Mantis.

1506
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,930
I can never remember her name.

1507
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,630
It's the alien picture.

1508
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:35,970
Oh my gosh!

1509
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:43,550
Octopus Mansion.

1510
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:48,350
We got all the flashbacks.

1511
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:09,530
He can say it!

1512
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:42,270
What?

1513
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:53,810
They are the war economy.

1514
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:09,650
A life of its own.

1515
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:20,610
The system.

1516
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:35,890
Oh!

1517
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:39,330
It works just like natural law.

1518
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:44,070
The world's a much simpler place than most folks realize.

1519
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:55,210
Every aspect of the Patriot system is closely monitored by three peripheral AIs and a core AI that ties them all together.

1520
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:57,890
The SOP system is one part of that.

1521
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:00,730
It's all backed up by a foolproof control system.

1522
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:04,630
So not even yours truly can sneak inside the Patriot's AI.

1523
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:06,290
Well luckily I'm super sneaky.

1524
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:20,010
Or an outer haven.

1525
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:37,270
Wow.

1526
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:43,730
Random guys.

1527
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,050
Where?

1528
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:12,450
Yeah, but what if I trick them?

1529
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:16,710
With a box.

1530
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,190
It's not me.

1531
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:31,550
It's everybody after me.

1532
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:35,830
Sneaky okay?

1533
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:37,870
Do you need some nanya?

1534
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,650
Okay.

1535
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,490
Yeah, actually I'm out of ammo.

1536
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,740
He blew kisses at me!

1537
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,660
Oh, nevermind.

1538
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,440
He wants a cigarette.

1539
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,420
I thought he was being like...

1540
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,300
At me!

1541
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,960
I have you!

1542
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,100
Bye Trevon!

1543
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:17,500
Bye bye.

1544
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,680
Damn, he's fast.

1545
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,000
He just scattled out of there.

1546
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,400
I have you.

1547
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,080
I think the monkey might be Snake's best friend.

1548
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,840
That's...

1549
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:36,000
Okay, these are our friends.

1550
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:36,700
We took over!

1551
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,740
Look at us everybody!

1552
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,760
Our stress is going up?

1553
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:41,160
Why?

1554
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,620
Why is it going up?

1555
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:48,660
Snake, chill.

1556
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:51,840
We're safe here now.

1557
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:52,680
It's cool now.

1558
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:54,980
Are these guys all... These guys are all dead probably.

1559
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,460
Alright Snake?

1560
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,420
What am I hearing whistling?

1561
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,980
Snake, are you okay?

1562
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:11,740
I'm running this guy literally ragged.

1563
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,800
You're okay, probably.

1564
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,480
You're okay, probably.

1565
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,880
I think I went the wrong way.

1566
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:22,920
I can't tell.

1567
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:27,830
Let's go in here.

1568
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:32,650
I can't tell if there's guys around here or not.

1569
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:34,150
Where's my friends?

1570
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:36,490
I hear people walking.

1571
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:38,810
They have to be my friends, right?

1572
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:39,370
We took over.

1573
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:43,940
You're okay, Snake?

1574
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,100
Just hold out.

1575
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:47,720
You got this.

1576
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,020
I hear someone walking.

1577
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:54,260
It's a friend, right?

1578
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:02,770
Oh, yeah.

1579
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:09,770
Yeah, it's me.

1580
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:11,050
See ya.

1581
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:14,710
Alright.

1582
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:16,710
Okay, we found our way in.

1583
01:43:17,810 --> 01:43:18,270
Wait.

1584
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:19,670
Right?

1585
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:22,710
Snake, you're okay.

1586
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:23,510
You're okay, buddy.

1587
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:25,610
How do I get into the other side?

1588
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,300
How do I get in here?

1589
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,000
In there.

1590
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:46,790
Let Snake eat.

1591
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:48,610
What do you want, Snake?

1592
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,410
You want some noodles?

1593
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:52,470
A bit of psyche.

1594
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:54,890
It warms the body.

1595
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:01,610
I need the nunya.

1596
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:04,310
Hold on.

1597
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:06,730
I need the nunya.

1598
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:10,870
I have...

1599
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:11,830
What?

1600
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:18,230
Sorry, the munya.

1601
01:44:18,930 --> 01:44:19,490
Here we go.

1602
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:20,870
Alright.

1603
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:22,710
Yeah, there we go.

1604
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:31,310
Nunya beeswax.

1605
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:31,950
Exactly.

1606
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:34,590
I can't figure out how to get in there.

1607
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:36,330
Unless I'm supposed to blow up the wall.

1608
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,310
Oh, I got some sleep gas.

1609
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:39,670
Fun.

1610
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,130
We like that.

1611
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:42,410
Let's go.

1612
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,100
Hello, excuse me.

1613
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:48,460
I'm friend.

1614
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,780
It's me.

1615
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,880
It's me.

1616
01:44:57,070 --> 01:44:57,670
Kiss.

1617
01:44:59,190 --> 01:44:59,790
Okay.

1618
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:01,750
Rude ass.

1619
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:04,130
Snake.

1620
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:06,690
Stop slouching.

1621
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:08,190
Your gamer pose.

1622
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:16,680
I feel like I have to blow that up or something.

1623
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:17,640
To get in there.

1624
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:23,670
You know?

1625
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:26,670
I feel like I have to or something.

1626
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:30,950
Let's try it.

1627
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:33,630
Oh my gosh, the compress.

1628
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:35,330
Do I still have some?

1629
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:36,950
Let's see.

1630
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:40,250
Oh Snake, you are so high maintenance now.

1631
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:42,290
A syringe.

1632
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:46,510
We have stuff for his hair.

1633
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:46,870
Wait.

1634
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:49,230
Does that help?

1635
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:51,050
Oh, there is a compress.

1636
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:51,830
I have five of them.

1637
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:52,390
Let's go.

1638
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,290
Let's switch out the box.

1639
01:45:59,210 --> 01:45:59,650
Okay.

1640
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,880
Did that help you, buddy?

1641
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:11,940
Oh, my bad.

1642
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:12,720
I went the wrong way.

1643
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:13,080
Okay.

1644
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:16,020
And let's... there we go.

1645
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:17,820
The moon-ya.

1646
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:19,540
Moon-ya.

1647
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:22,580
I'm gonna moon-ya.

1648
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:31,610
Alright, let's try blowing this up.

1649
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,140
My sister once got suspended from school because she mooned her teacher.

1650
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,840
Let's switch out...

1651
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,960
We'll just switch out this for now.

1652
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,060
And then we'll do...

1653
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,200
We have...

1654
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:52,460
C4.

1655
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,340
I only have three though.

1656
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,660
I only have three.

1657
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,960
L1, plant...

1658
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,160
Oh wait.

1659
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,420
Ready with L1, plant with R1.

1660
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,380
Is this one right?

1661
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:08,600
Okay.

1662
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,400
L1, R1.

1663
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,020
And then run away.

1664
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:16,560
Run, run, run, run.

1665
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,700
Far, far, far, far, far.

1666
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:19,560
And... kapow!

1667
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:22,880
Oh sorry, it was me!

1668
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:31,170
How do you get in there?

1669
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:35,430
The ladder?

1670
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:38,710
There's no ladder on this.

1671
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:42,050
Ladder?

1672
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:42,770
This one?

1673
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,020
Is there someone up here?

1674
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:55,080
Just me.

1675
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:57,800
I think.

1676
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,580
Oh, and a friend.

1677
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,240
How the heck am I supposed to...

1678
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:04,920
Oh, no.

1679
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:08,020
How the heck?

1680
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:11,340
Sorry, I just want to get the missile launcher.

1681
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,740
If I hang though...

1682
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:16,320
If I hang...

1683
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,560
Oh my god.

1684
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:24,020
It worked.

1685
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:24,060
Great.

1686
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:27,820
Let's go snake.

1687
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,580
Falling in slow motion.

1688
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,840
We got a rifle scope!

1689
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:46,120
And... some other stuff.

1690
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:51,870
Nice.

1691
01:48:52,430 --> 01:48:53,830
And then there's more down here.

1692
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:56,190
Nice.

1693
01:48:58,690 --> 01:48:59,710
This...

1694
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:00,470
The FIM!

1695
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:02,990
How much... did I get any money for that?

1696
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,650
Okay, we don't need that.

1697
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:07,770
No money?

1698
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:13,160
Hmm, curious.

1699
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,620
Alright, old snake.

1700
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,880
Wait, can I do this?

1701
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,240
Go up, and then...

1702
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:24,720
And then...

1703
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,700
Yeah, and then... there we go.

1704
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,120
Easy.

1705
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,800
Nice hallminky.

1706
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:32,020
Thank you.

1707
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,960
And our psyche is all full.

1708
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:36,140
And we can return...

1709
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:37,060
Our battery is full.

1710
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,060
We can leave.

1711
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:41,740
Keep heading north.

1712
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:49,520
What's this?

1713
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:50,400
Oh, C4!

1714
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,720
Oh my god.

1715
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:55,260
You...

1716
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,620
I can't see.

1717
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,720
I can't see.

1718
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:58,940
I can't see...

1719
01:49:58,940 --> 01:49:59,440
Oh, there I go.

1720
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,340
They really kinda baited me.

1721
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,220
I really would've seen that and been like, Oh yeah, I need the C4!

1722
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,480
For everything.

1723
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:15,080
I think we probably looted this place enough, so we can continue onwards.

1724
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:26,780
Onwards towards Naomi.

1725
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,260
Wait, what's over here?

1726
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,400
Versus over there.

1727
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:34,740
Mmm, secret path.

1728
01:50:44,210 --> 01:50:45,090
Noodles.

1729
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:48,150
It's me.

1730
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:53,530
Say hi or anything.

1731
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,430
Rude.

1732
01:50:55,770 --> 01:50:57,090
We got more playboy.

1733
01:50:59,110 --> 01:50:59,990
Hello.

1734
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:01,770
Hello, friends.

1735
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:05,010
This is why it's so much more worth keeping the friends, you know?

1736
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:06,710
What is that?

1737
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:09,690
It looks so strange.

1738
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:11,290
Looks like a whale.

1739
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:14,910
Okay.

1740
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,040
All my homies hate Naomi.

1741
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:22,380
I know!

1742
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:24,640
You're in good company here.

1743
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,760
You're in good company here.

1744
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,120
Anything up here?

1745
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:31,960
No?

1746
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,240
Just a little vantage point?

1747
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,080
Okay, sorry.

1748
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:35,500
I'm exploring.

1749
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:38,140
Let's go, Snake!

1750
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,680
I saved your ass earlier!

1751
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:48,300
And you're gonna be so rude to me?

1752
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,160
Scares me.

1753
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:58,520
Yeah, we might be the most anti-Naomi place on the internet.

1754
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,620
But you know...

1755
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:09,730
It's all in good fun.

1756
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:12,050
Gosh, look at that.

1757
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:14,070
Hold on.

1758
01:52:14,230 --> 01:52:16,970
Let's get him a little less brown.

1759
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:20,750
His cheeks...

1760
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:26,470
Does Snake not feel like the sneaking suit going all the way up his butt?

1761
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:31,530
Who's going?

1762
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:32,290
Me?

1763
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:33,530
I'm going.

1764
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:36,690
If bad, why hot?

1765
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:41,420
That's the best part.

1766
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,400
Possibly.

1767
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,180
He does, he just likes it.

1768
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:50,460
I've tried wearing thongs before.

1769
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:51,620
And they're just...

1770
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,420
I just can't...

1771
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,420
It's just always feels like a perpetual...

1772
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:59,060
A perpetual...

1773
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:02,680
What's the thing called?

1774
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:03,880
A wedgie.

1775
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:05,980
Yeah.

1776
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:10,660
Do you think on off days he wears those yoga pants?

1777
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:15,720
Snake,

1778
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:23,060
can you hear me?

1779
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:24,300
This is Jack.

1780
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:25,860
Jack is back.

1781
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:28,280
I read it.

1782
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:29,120
Where are you now?

1783
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,760
I'm right beside you.

1784
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,300
Oh my God.

1785
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,200
Where have you been all this time?

1786
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,340
What have you been doing?

1787
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:35,600
On a mission.

1788
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:36,980
Finding something.

1789
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:38,260
For someone.

1790
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:39,980
Finding what?

1791
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,580
The corpse of Big Boss.

1792
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:44,480
What?

1793
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:48,160
I was asked to do this in exchange for Sunny's location.

1794
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:49,480
Liquid?

1795
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:50,540
No.

1796
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:52,900
The leader of a small resistance group.

1797
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:56,320
Her followers call her Matka Pluku.

1798
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:57,880
Matka Pluku.

1799
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:00,620
Big Mama.

1800
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,300
We'll finish this later.

1801
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,400
I'll follow your trail and catch up with you.

1802
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:06,120
Wait.

1803
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:07,920
What about Big Boss's body?

1804
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:09,400
It's with her now.

1805
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:10,360
Her?

1806
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:11,720
Big Mama.

1807
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:13,860
What's going on, Snake?

1808
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:16,780
Rose, I just got a call from Raiden.

1809
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:19,220
It sounds like he's close by.

1810
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:20,180
Jack?

1811
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:21,100
Yeah.

1812
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:23,420
Did he seem ok?

1813
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,060
Yeah, as far as I can tell from his voice.

1814
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:26,760
Why doesn't it work?

1815
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:28,720
That's great.

1816
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:31,600
Snake, I have a favor to ask.

1817
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:32,160
It does work.

1818
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:35,400
Don't let him know I'm involved in this operation, ok?

1819
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:36,120
Ok.

1820
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:39,220
I think it would be best to just leave him alone for now.

1821
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:41,800
What happened between you and Jack?

1822
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:46,680
After the Big Shell incident, he became unstable.

1823
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:53,400
Memories began to resurface from his childhood when he fought for Solidus in the Liberian Civil War.

1824
01:54:53,980 --> 01:55:00,980
And in the midst of all of that, the baby we had together... it hadn't even been born yet.

1825
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:02,180
She's calling the baby an id.

1826
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,680
It's messed up.

1827
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:07,280
And when he did, he'd be dead drunk.

1828
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:10,220
Sometimes covered in cuts and bruises.

1829
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:11,880
Roy was worried.

1830
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:14,000
He was Jack's commanding officer.

1831
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:16,560
But Jack just avoided him.

1832
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,520
I was all alone.

1833
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:22,820
And Roy was so kind to me.

1834
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:25,840
He's the one who encouraged me to become a counselor.

1835
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:31,020
I know it sounds like I'm making excuses, but I needed to get over it.

1836
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,360
To move on with my life.

1837
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:38,640
I'm worried about him, of course, but I'm also afraid of him.

1838
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:39,640
Alright.

1839
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,820
I'll keep my mouth shut.

1840
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:43,260
Thank you, Snake.

1841
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,680
Oh, Raiden.

1842
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:46,780
Oh.

1843
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,940
Oh, Raiden.

1844
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,660
Our troubled... he's so troubled.

1845
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,220
Our little guy.

1846
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:03,680
I can't tell if these are enemies or pals.

1847
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:05,040
Friend or foe?

1848
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:06,460
Foe.

1849
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:14,430
I see two of them.

1850
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:16,430
I see three of them.

1851
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:19,730
Where are our friends, anyway?

1852
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:23,210
Where are our friends?

1853
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:25,190
Oh, shoot.

1854
01:56:28,030 --> 01:56:28,650
Cry.

1855
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:28,830
Cry.

1856
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,340
Oh, are you gonna cry about it?

1857
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,040
Are you gonna cry about it?

1858
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,680
Do I have to get a headshot?

1859
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:52,420
Does this last?

1860
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:57,060
They sound absolutely distressed.

1861
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:06,430
Oh, wait.

1862
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:08,610
Sorry, I just realized.

1863
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:10,350
What the?

1864
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:14,100
Wait, they're crying!

1865
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,540
Oh, that's not good.

1866
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:29,780
That's not good.

1867
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,960
That's not great.

1868
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,420
That's an enemy gunship.

1869
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,240
Oh my god!

1870
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:43,120
That's an enemy... get down, boss.

1871
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,000
Get down.

1872
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,420
That's an enemy gunship.

1873
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,260
Come on!

1874
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:53,020
What did I... Oh, just take out the C4.

1875
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:55,980
Boss, get down.

1876
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:58,500
That's an enemy gunship.

1877
01:57:58,760 --> 01:57:59,960
We can use the railgun.

1878
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:04,720
We can really take them down with that, probably.

1879
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,040
Oh gosh!

1880
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:09,260
Oh, no.

1881
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,500
Who's behind me?

1882
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:17,660
You hit.

1883
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,000
Let's see.

1884
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,420
Where did that guy go?

1885
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:26,740
Oh my gosh, I'm not gonna be able to see anything if you keep blowing everything up!

1886
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,800
Yeah, you're welcome.

1887
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:33,360
I'm good as hell.

1888
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,080
Sorry, man.

1889
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,440
Maybe don't stand in the open, you know?

1890
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:46,890
Where did he go?

1891
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,840
I'm taking your money.

1892
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:57,400
Thank you.

1893
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:00,800
Oh my gosh.

1894
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,040
Now I'm in the middle.

1895
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:04,700
I'm getting in the middle of it.

1896
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:06,400
You're welcome.

1897
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:08,500
Oh my god.

1898
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,400
I'm not killing them, I promise.

1899
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:11,560
It's everybody else.

1900
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:20,480
Very nice.

1901
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:25,120
That's what they say when they see my behind, baby.

1902
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:28,300
Very nice.

1903
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:34,750
Nice, OK.

1904
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:39,710
They blew it up!

1905
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:41,130
What about the helicopter?

1906
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:43,970
What are we gonna do about that?

1907
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:50,430
I'll also... Oh, just kidding.

1908
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,670
There's more guys coming in.

1909
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:02,350
Very nice.

1910
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:08,290
Yeah!

1911
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:10,330
Get him!

1912
02:00:11,490 --> 02:00:12,450
Get him!

1913
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:13,010
I'll

1914
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:23,540
take the money and go.

1915
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:29,610
Oh shoot!

1916
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:32,230
No we don't!

1917
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:34,830
Oh my gosh.

1918
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:42,300
Why would you not send reinforcements before?

1919
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:47,920
Why would you not send them before this?

1920
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:55,300
Where are your priorities?

1921
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:03,180
Why am I the problem and not the guys that are literally killing your men?

1922
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,680
I forgot that we were on the crying.

1923
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:16,260
I forgot we were still crying.

1924
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:20,720
Nice shot.

1925
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:21,300
Thank you.

1926
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,560
I'm a bit of a gamer.

1927
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:33,540
Our stress is getting a little high, but we're OK.

1928
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,900
Alright Snake, don't worry about it.

1929
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:37,460
Don't worry about it.

1930
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:38,020
Oh shoot.

1931
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:45,180
Can I go up here?

1932
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:48,180
Anyone up here?

1933
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,900
Oh, there's some ammo.

1934
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:55,680
I'll take it.

1935
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:04,820
He's still crying.

1936
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,840
I think.

1937
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:14,890
Cry!

1938
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:16,230
Cry.

1939
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:20,550
I think that's...

1940
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:22,170
We're almost out of...

1941
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:23,970
Just sounds like us before stream.

1942
02:02:24,110 --> 02:02:24,510
I know!

1943
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:25,890
I love it!

1944
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:28,530
But I think... Oh wait, we need to go to Dreb and shop.

1945
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:32,090
I think we'll go back to the regular...

1946
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:34,150
The regular ammo.

1947
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:35,110
It's cheaper even.

1948
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:39,910
Let's go with like 5.

1949
02:02:42,350 --> 02:02:44,070
I hate spending money.

1950
02:02:45,450 --> 02:02:46,290
Are you gonna start crying?

1951
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:50,110
Oh, and then we...

1952
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:53,110
Switch to the...

1953
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:55,490
Anesthesia.

1954
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,360
You're welcome!

1955
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:05,680
I wanna take out the helicopter, but can I?

1956
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:09,060
Can I also take out the helicopter?

1957
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:09,700
Wait!

1958
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:10,960
I have big guns!

1959
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,380
I have big guns.

1960
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:13,900
We can take him out, probably.

1961
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,960
Let's take out the big guns.

1962
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:16,780
Let's see.

1963
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:22,400
Make the helicopter cry?

1964
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:25,580
I just used my last one.

1965
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,360
You think we can use the rail gun?

1966
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:37,520
Oops, I didn't put it in.

1967
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:40,780
Let's use the rail gun.

1968
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:44,320
We also got the FIM.

1969
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:48,860
Rail gun!

1970
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:49,740
Where are you?

1971
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,180
Anti-tank...

1972
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,160
We got the RPG.

1973
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,540
Rail gun time!

1974
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,920
She loves to see us cry.

1975
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:07,320
Snake, I need you to stand up.

1976
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:08,440
Alright buddy.

1977
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:10,860
Wait, hold on.

1978
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:11,980
I need to go downstairs.

1979
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,240
Alright!

1980
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:16,840
We're gearing up for it!

1981
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:19,260
We're gearing up!

1982
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:20,060
We're gearing up!

1983
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,360
That was so exciting!

1984
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:29,600
That was so exciting!

1985
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:40,310
Stop running!

1986
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,830
I'm gonna get you.

1987
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:48,130
Get you!

1988
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:51,530
Yeah!

1989
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:53,810
We did it!

1990
02:04:54,490 --> 02:04:55,450
We took him out!

1991
02:04:56,670 --> 02:05:00,190
I'm gonna get in the shade a little bit so that our stress goes down.

1992
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:02,830
What are these guys doing over here?

1993
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:08,470
Oh, I think he's dead.

1994
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:09,210
Maybe?

1995
02:05:10,570 --> 02:05:11,610
Oh, yeah.

1996
02:05:11,890 --> 02:05:13,090
I think they're dead.

1997
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:14,970
Oh, there's more!

1998
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:17,350
I like to help them take out the guys.

1999
02:05:17,450 --> 02:05:17,970
It's so fun.

2000
02:05:21,970 --> 02:05:24,210
I really need to get their stuff though.

2001
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:29,690
Could they like stop coming out so I could...

2002
02:05:30,350 --> 02:05:31,570
Oh, I heard more.

2003
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:33,170
I heard more people guys.

2004
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:34,190
More guys coming out!

2005
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:36,410
Oh, there they are!

2006
02:05:39,730 --> 02:05:40,210
Oh,

2007
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:46,200
hold on.

2008
02:05:46,420 --> 02:05:50,240
Let me move over just a tad so that you guys can see...

2009
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,220
what weapons and stuff I'm using.

2010
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:54,100
Okay!

2011
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:56,600
This is where you farm?

2012
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:57,300
No!

2013
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:59,240
Well, yes and no because...

2014
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,000
Not me.

2015
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,820
Okay.

2016
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,200
Alright.

2017
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:06,920
Nice.

2018
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:08,180
We got camping.

2019
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:12,980
Because... Oh, shoot.

2020
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:14,460
Wait, they did actually see me.

2021
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:15,940
Where are they?

2022
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:21,950
Is he trying to unload on me?

2023
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:23,530
Oh my god, no!

2024
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:28,490
You've been being attacked!

2025
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:30,670
Why am I the problem?

2026
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:34,450
Oh my god!

2027
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:36,190
I didn't see that guy.

2028
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:39,030
Holy smokes.

2029
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:43,150
I think that hit, but maybe not.

2030
02:06:47,730 --> 02:06:49,150
Do you have any stuff I can take?

2031
02:06:58,870 --> 02:07:02,710
It's like... I don't think this is the area because...

2032
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:07,090
They said that it was like a place where...

2033
02:07:07,090 --> 02:07:13,810
It was a place where you...

2034
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:16,190
Was that at me?

2035
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:19,870
Where is the frog unit?

2036
02:07:21,930 --> 02:07:24,130
And they drop like big bugs.

2037
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:27,390
So that's why I'm like, I don't think it's here.

2038
02:07:30,410 --> 02:07:32,810
Look at, they're all like burnt to a crisp.

2039
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:39,780
Sounds like Robin.

2040
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:47,540
Sorry, that was supposed to scare me.

2041
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:49,540
Are they coming out?

2042
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:51,800
I think so, yeah.

2043
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:07,120
Oh my goodness!

2044
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:14,520
I can't tell where...

2045
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:17,180
Back me up!

2046
02:08:17,420 --> 02:08:18,740
At least we got the helicopter.

2047
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:19,880
It's a lot more quiet.

2048
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:23,300
They're over here too.

2049
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:24,020
Wait!

2050
02:08:27,890 --> 02:08:28,790
Oh my gosh.

2051
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:31,830
Is that tank also doing something?

2052
02:08:34,610 --> 02:08:35,890
Or am I crazy?

2053
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:44,460
Guy up there, I see him.

2054
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:51,540
Are my friends here?

2055
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:56,780
Is the tank doing anything?

2056
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,640
Should I blow it up?

2057
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:05,930
Crazy either way.

2058
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:09,610
Oh, he's still alive.

2059
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:10,270
He made it.

2060
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:11,910
Wow, lucky duck.

2061
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:14,330
Oh hello.

2062
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:16,730
Move, move, move!

2063
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:17,770
We're taking over!

2064
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:21,830
Let me take their weapons.

2065
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:22,910
Please.

2066
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,590
Blow it up?

2067
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:28,350
Should we just blow it up for the fun of it?

2068
02:09:31,870 --> 02:09:33,870
Yeah, this doesn't even give that much.

2069
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:34,590
Excuse me!

2070
02:09:38,150 --> 02:09:39,290
Excuse me!

2071
02:09:42,210 --> 02:09:43,850
Don't shoot me.

2072
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:46,790
There we go.

2073
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:54,530
And I can go upstairs and get this guy.

2074
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:56,690
I think I can go upstairs.

2075
02:09:56,970 --> 02:09:59,090
I can go upstairs somehow.

2076
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:01,430
There we go.

2077
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:04,070
Can you sell the tank?

2078
02:10:04,190 --> 02:10:11,370
Gosh, imagine if they introduce the Fulton and everything here so that we could sell tanks and stuff.

2079
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:13,070
It would be big news.

2080
02:10:14,430 --> 02:10:15,790
This guy has nothing.

2081
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:16,610
What?

2082
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:17,450
Lame.

2083
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:19,270
Lame, lame, lame.

2084
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:22,210
I like you still love Metal Gear.

2085
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:25,410
Yeah, I do really love Metal Gear still so much.

2086
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:27,710
Run away babies.

2087
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:28,730
Oh nope, those are my friends.

2088
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:29,230
Just kidding.

2089
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:33,710
My bad.

2090
02:10:34,930 --> 02:10:35,830
They are my friends.

2091
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:37,910
I wouldn't call them babies ever.

2092
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:39,530
This guy is still asleep.

2093
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:45,330
Nice.

2094
02:10:53,390 --> 02:10:54,830
I need backup.

2095
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:56,090
Everybody friends?

2096
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:57,350
Friends and family.

2097
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:00,190
I need backup.

2098
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:06,890
Look, the thing we have... Oh, I didn't even need to shoot him anyway.

2099
02:11:09,190 --> 02:11:09,690
No!

2100
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:13,640
You jerk.

2101
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,400
They killed him.

2102
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:22,240
I don't have to do anything here.

2103
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:22,880
It's kind of great.

2104
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:29,070
Sneak 100.

2105
02:11:30,850 --> 02:11:32,930
They don't give that much I think.

2106
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:37,450
No, my friends!

2107
02:11:37,630 --> 02:11:38,270
Back me up.

2108
02:11:41,790 --> 02:11:42,410
Fire!

2109
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,580
Yeah, you want to take me down?

2110
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:56,620
You have to go through me and this army.

2111
02:11:57,140 --> 02:11:57,400
Hello?

2112
02:11:58,960 --> 02:11:59,740
Kill him?

2113
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:01,180
You're welcome.

2114
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:03,760
Oh my gosh.

2115
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:05,700
Oh my god!

2116
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:07,720
Holy...

2117
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:09,840
You got the tank!

2118
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:19,680
Yeah, I got him.

2119
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:20,640
I got his ass.

2120
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:31,310
They are not going to know where I am.

2121
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:32,970
I got you.

2122
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:34,750
I had you.

2123
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:36,610
I don't have you.

2124
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:39,430
I don't have you.

2125
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:42,010
I'm trying to get up the hill.

2126
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:43,630
I'm a little slow.

2127
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:46,050
My old man.

2128
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:47,330
I'm trying.

2129
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:48,270
He's running.

2130
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:49,390
He's running.

2131
02:12:49,830 --> 02:12:50,670
I got him.

2132
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:52,290
I don't have him.

2133
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:53,170
I got him.

2134
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:54,690
I am good.

2135
02:12:57,790 --> 02:12:58,810
Watch my psyche.

2136
02:12:59,010 --> 02:12:59,370
We are OK.

2137
02:13:00,630 --> 02:13:01,170
We are fine.

2138
02:13:02,610 --> 02:13:03,430
Everything is good.

2139
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:07,510
When is this place going to be taken over?

2140
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:13,000
We are farming though.

2141
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:18,040
Where are you?

2142
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,000
Where is the enemy?

2143
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:21,720
I'm backing you up.

2144
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:26,280
No!

2145
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:27,360
His weapon disappeared.

2146
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:28,720
I just saw it.

2147
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,360
Oh my gosh.

2148
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,820
I have to be faster.

2149
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:35,920
Be careful.

2150
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:36,880
Holy cow.

2151
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:40,580
Thank you.

2152
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,320
Yeah, I've been here the whole time.

2153
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:48,900
These guys.

2154
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:52,240
Giving Snake a real heart attack?

2155
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:52,580
No!

2156
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:55,280
Our stress is high, but it's just because we are in the daylight.

2157
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:57,760
If I go under here, he will be fine.

2158
02:13:58,620 --> 02:13:59,760
It's just like a little worm.

2159
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:00,280
See?

2160
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,940
Stress is going down.

2161
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:05,900
Snake isn't used to being out in the open.

2162
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:11,040
He likes to take it more stealthily and chill.

2163
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:12,780
Oh, I can get this guy's legs.

2164
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:14,920
Or not.

2165
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:15,720
Oh, I can.

2166
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:16,520
Or not.

2167
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:17,080
I can.

2168
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:24,400
He is a bit of an introvert.

2169
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:24,900
Exactly.

2170
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:27,280
Is our stress already halved?

2171
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:28,000
Almost.

2172
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:32,540
Did we win?

2173
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:35,720
I'm going in.

2174
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,500
Did we win?

2175
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:42,620
I'm taking the missile launcher.

2176
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:43,780
Charge!

2177
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:45,520
Take all their money.

2178
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:47,380
Don't let them sell anything.

2179
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:51,760
Eventually these guys are going to wake up though, so you might want to actually kill them.

2180
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,780
If that's your prerogative, you know.

2181
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:58,560
Oh, friend!

2182
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:02,140
I won't let your money go unpaid.

2183
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,380
Our money now.

2184
02:15:06,020 --> 02:15:09,120
Who is exploding around here?

2185
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:14,710
Projectile!

2186
02:15:17,090 --> 02:15:18,550
I'm going inside.

2187
02:15:20,330 --> 02:15:22,070
I'm sneaking in.

2188
02:15:22,510 --> 02:15:23,070
Hello, friend.

2189
02:15:24,590 --> 02:15:25,670
Oh my gosh!

2190
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:26,190
I'll help.

2191
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:28,550
I would if you let me.

2192
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:29,130
Oh my gosh.

2193
02:15:29,930 --> 02:15:32,070
I think that's overkill!

2194
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:34,990
You're welcome.

2195
02:15:35,970 --> 02:15:38,230
I won't let your money go in vain.

2196
02:15:41,870 --> 02:15:42,970
Go, go, go!

2197
02:15:43,650 --> 02:15:44,130
Nice.

2198
02:15:44,370 --> 02:15:45,370
Sold that for 3000.

2199
02:15:47,770 --> 02:15:48,730
Very nice.

2200
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:53,200
Nice.

2201
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:54,260
Oh, it's chaffing in.

2202
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:57,140
Compressed noodles?

2203
02:15:57,860 --> 02:15:58,620
Nice, nice, nice.

2204
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:00,700
Oh, they can come in here.

2205
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:03,780
I just thought for some reason it was a blocked off room.

2206
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:08,100
Are you alright, snake?

2207
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:09,640
Oh, our psyche.

2208
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:10,220
No!

2209
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:11,360
Why again?

2210
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:11,900
Snake!

2211
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:14,660
I need some munya.

2212
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:17,980
Munya time.

2213
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:19,980
Gamer posture.

2214
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:22,180
Afraid of natural sunlight?

2215
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:24,740
Snake really is just like you and me for real.

2216
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:26,920
This guy is still asleep.

2217
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:31,700
It's taking a long time to take over this area, huh?

2218
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:34,360
They just don't stop.

2219
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:40,440
Oh shoot.

2220
02:16:47,180 --> 02:16:48,240
We're fine.

2221
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:49,920
Everything is good everybody.

2222
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:53,700
Don't worry about it.

2223
02:16:57,470 --> 02:16:58,090
It's me.

2224
02:16:59,150 --> 02:17:00,670
It's just me, you guys.

2225
02:17:02,270 --> 02:17:05,910
Does he have anything to offer with the class?

2226
02:17:06,030 --> 02:17:06,150
No?

2227
02:17:08,590 --> 02:17:09,370
I don't know, Robin.

2228
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:09,950
What's going on?

2229
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:10,690
Oh no!

2230
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:20,480
This poor sap just woke up.

2231
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:25,540
Oh my god.

2232
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:30,540
They didn't even let him have a second.

2233
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,300
Oh my gosh.

2234
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:34,380
I'm here.

2235
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:36,400
Oh, wait.

2236
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:37,840
Is that the guy that just came out?

2237
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:41,520
Yeah!

2238
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:48,170
Poor guy for real.

2239
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:53,290
Oh look, you can see their like... Wow.

2240
02:17:54,410 --> 02:17:55,550
That's so cool.

2241
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:58,070
You can see their little octopus.

2242
02:17:58,870 --> 02:17:59,210
Damn!

2243
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:01,190
Oh my god, he's already dead.

2244
02:18:05,390 --> 02:18:06,450
I'll take it.

2245
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:07,470
Nice, thank you.

2246
02:18:08,130 --> 02:18:08,830
Oh gosh!

2247
02:18:13,290 --> 02:18:14,450
He's going to come out.

2248
02:18:14,650 --> 02:18:15,430
I'm going to get him.

2249
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:16,670
Oh my gosh.

2250
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:19,630
I will.

2251
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:22,870
I got you.

2252
02:18:24,750 --> 02:18:25,630
I got you.

2253
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:32,630
An infinite spawn point.

2254
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:33,290
Actually...

2255
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:36,990
Actually though, kind of.

2256
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:37,570
Charge!

2257
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,580
They eventually stop.

2258
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:51,490
1,500.

2259
02:18:51,770 --> 02:18:52,450
1,050.

2260
02:18:53,610 --> 02:18:54,210
Rodrigo!

2261
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:56,810
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

2262
02:18:58,990 --> 02:19:00,290
The guns are disappearing.

2263
02:19:00,410 --> 02:19:02,350
I know, I'm trying to grab them when I can.

2264
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:09,370
What's our money at anyway?

2265
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:14,290
We're at 3...31.

2266
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:17,550
300,000.

2267
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:18,170
Yippee!

2268
02:19:20,510 --> 02:19:21,270
Only...

2269
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:26,600
That's so painful.

2270
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:28,520
It's kind of slow too.

2271
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:34,640
It's kind of slow here I feel.

2272
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,860
It's kind of slow, no?

2273
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:41,140
Oh.

2274
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:43,400
Oh.

2275
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:45,240
Where the hell did you come from?

2276
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:48,140
Bye?

2277
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:52,830
Rise and shine.

2278
02:19:56,110 --> 02:19:56,710
What?

2279
02:19:59,210 --> 02:19:59,530
What?

2280
02:19:59,910 --> 02:20:00,370
What?

2281
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:16,070
I already took that other guy's stuff.

2282
02:20:17,470 --> 02:20:20,970
The rocket launcher against the sleeping guys is kind of insane to me.

2283
02:20:20,970 --> 02:20:21,810
Damn!

2284
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:24,890
Oh my god, he was just asleep.

2285
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:31,480
Are any more going to come out of the building?

2286
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:35,460
I am!

2287
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:37,980
Oh, uh oh.

2288
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:39,100
Got

2289
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:46,060
him!

2290
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:47,780
Hold on, I'm going to take his weapon.

2291
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:49,580
That's a big money.

2292
02:20:49,980 --> 02:20:50,900
Oh gosh!

2293
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:52,460
Who's shooting me?

2294
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:53,420
Ouch!

2295
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:56,500
Aren't you supposed to be my ally?

2296
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:03,820
They are actually trying to kill me.

2297
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:10,320
You cannot reach him!

2298
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:15,640
You cannot get him unless you come here.

2299
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:22,980
I almost feel like leaving, but...

2300
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:28,380
I feel like this place is kind of slow to farm, you know?

2301
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,240
Even if we've been farming a little bit.

2302
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:35,740
I thought that they would take over the building like they did before.

2303
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:37,620
That doesn't seem to be the case.

2304
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:40,800
Oh, damn it.

2305
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:44,920
Not anymore.

2306
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:54,860
It was a trap.

2307
02:21:57,860 --> 02:21:59,660
You'll never find me in here!

2308
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,880
You'll never catch me alive!

2309
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:04,620
Did he see me?

2310
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:08,660
Did he see me?

2311
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:11,560
Is this a bad...

2312
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:13,040
I can't tell.

2313
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:14,400
That's a bad guy, right?

2314
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:18,980
He looked right at me, but...

2315
02:22:20,860 --> 02:22:21,900
To me?

2316
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:26,140
Did you just blow yourself up?

2317
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:27,420
Oh no.

2318
02:22:27,740 --> 02:22:28,480
OK, just kidding.

2319
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:31,020
That would have been so funny.

2320
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:36,980
Alright, let's go.

2321
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:38,140
Let's move on.

2322
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:42,200
Shit.

2323
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:44,020
Help me!

2324
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:46,800
You're supposed to be my friend!

2325
02:22:47,380 --> 02:22:48,940
Oh my god!

2326
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,800
You're supposed to be my friend!

2327
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:52,820
What the fuck?

2328
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,600
Oh my god.

2329
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:58,260
No more.

2330
02:22:58,580 --> 02:22:59,440
No, Snake, get underneath.

2331
02:23:00,820 --> 02:23:02,500
Snake, go underneath please.

2332
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:04,740
I need you to get some stress down.

2333
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:09,000
Someone just came out.

2334
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:11,120
Where did they go?

2335
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:14,940
Contact where?

2336
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:15,420
Me?

2337
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:16,320
No.

2338
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:17,580
You're a liar.

2339
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:19,660
You're lying.

2340
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:20,400
You're lying.

2341
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:22,920
Let's leave, guys.

2342
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:26,020
Oh, I put my friend to sleep!

2343
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:27,740
Sorry, I thought you were the enemy.

2344
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:31,540
Everybody is my enemy!

2345
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:36,020
OK, let's get our stress down a little bit more.

2346
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:41,500
Oh my god!

2347
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:42,100
There he goes!

2348
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:47,460
We just watched him phase out of existence.

2349
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:49,360
That was crazy.

2350
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:51,580
Are these my friends?

2351
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:53,920
No.

2352
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:55,000
Foe.

2353
02:23:55,460 --> 02:23:56,100
You're a foe.

2354
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:05,150
Yeah, we are in a de-stressing environment.

2355
02:24:05,150 --> 02:24:14,000
I would like for them to kind of charge again, so I don't get caught, but...

2356
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:23,560
I think we're OK.

2357
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:27,340
We're not OK.

2358
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:31,460
How do I get you?

2359
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:34,540
Did I get him?

2360
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:35,600
I don't know.

2361
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:37,200
Oh, I think I did.

2362
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:39,780
Dum-dum.

2363
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:41,400
Stupid.

2364
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:46,820
Oh look, there's more stuff.

2365
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:49,340
See, there's like some playboy things here.

2366
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:57,720
There's...

2367
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:58,680
Now we're just gonna leave.

2368
02:25:00,140 --> 02:25:01,560
Got things in here.

2369
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:03,860
Oh!

2370
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:04,880
New weapons.

2371
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:07,840
We love to see it.

2372
02:25:14,620 --> 02:25:15,520
Not me.

2373
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:20,000
Focus on the guys that are actually trying to kill you, I think.

2374
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:24,820
OK.

2375
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:33,420
Let's leave.

2376
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:39,520
That's sold for 12,000!

2377
02:25:40,780 --> 02:25:41,860
What was that?

2378
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:42,960
What did you have?

2379
02:25:43,220 --> 02:25:43,760
Give it to me.

2380
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:44,500
Give me more.

2381
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:45,500
What else did you have?

2382
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:49,160
Oh!

2383
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:51,480
Big money.

2384
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:58,800
Oh my god, please.

2385
02:25:58,800 --> 02:25:58,900
Please.

2386
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,320
I think he actually left.

2387
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:05,320
Hey!

2388
02:26:08,850 --> 02:26:09,490
Bye bye.

2389
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:15,810
I'm a little... I don't wanna... I'm sick of this area.

2390
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:18,530
I'm sick of this area!

2391
02:26:22,090 --> 02:26:24,310
It said it was custom parts.

2392
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,870
I'm not quite sure.

2393
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,740
Oh, my friends.

2394
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:33,080
Hello everybody.

2395
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:36,600
I can get him.

2396
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:38,320
Trust.

2397
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:39,700
Trust.

2398
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:40,860
Trust.

2399
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:48,200
It never ends!

2400
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:49,620
This war!

2401
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:52,320
This war never ends!

2402
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:56,420
Oh my gosh!

2403
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:58,580
Just everywhere we go.

2404
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,200
Let me get the machine gun.

2405
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,340
Does that say it's only 200?

2406
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:10,400
Only 200 money?

2407
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:14,660
3,000 money!

2408
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:18,700
OK, so the number means nothing.

2409
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:35,310
What do you got?

2410
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:37,090
1,000 money?

2411
02:27:37,090 --> 02:27:37,130
Money?

2412
02:27:41,250 --> 02:27:41,930
He

2413
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:52,080
scared me.

2414
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,700
I really have a helmet on, guy.

2415
02:27:58,700 --> 02:28:01,080
Sorry guys, I'm so...

2416
02:28:06,220 --> 02:28:08,020
I ate that!

2417
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:09,660
Oh my god!

2418
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:11,900
I absolutely ate that!

2419
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:13,020
Snake, are you OK?

2420
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:15,480
Holy moly!

2421
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:17,960
What?

2422
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:21,200
That was intensive.

2423
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:27,320
Gosh!

2424
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:30,800
Snake, the rebels have got an armored dozer.

2425
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,940
They're probably going to use it to bust their way into the mansion.

2426
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:37,000
Give it some cover and it might get you inside the compound.

2427
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:41,940
I got him.

2428
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:44,260
I'm taking him out.

2429
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:46,120
That was so easy.

2430
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:50,620
Charge!

2431
02:28:53,140 --> 02:28:53,660
Charge!

2432
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:54,040
Charge!

2433
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:57,800
Is there still money available?

2434
02:28:58,260 --> 02:29:00,220
Or we're just all inside now?

2435
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:06,660
Sorry, my focus is all... I'm so money motivated.

2436
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:10,940
I'm too money motivated, guys.

2437
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,020
I need to change my ways.

2438
02:29:17,410 --> 02:29:19,030
But I mean...

2439
02:29:19,030 --> 02:29:21,850
With all this sweet, sweet cash everywhere.

2440
02:29:21,950 --> 02:29:22,670
You're still alive?

2441
02:29:24,310 --> 02:29:24,750
Or...

2442
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:27,490
No, I think you just got rolled over.

2443
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:32,490
Oh, that's a friend coming up.

2444
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:33,690
Oh my gosh, you scared me.

2445
02:29:41,950 --> 02:29:43,370
Back you up?

2446
02:29:45,010 --> 02:29:45,450
Or...

2447
02:29:47,710 --> 02:29:48,350
We do?

2448
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:57,630
Oh, Naomi.

2449
02:30:01,210 --> 02:30:03,830
I thought he said back that up.

2450
02:30:04,290 --> 02:30:05,270
Back me up?

2451
02:30:06,330 --> 02:30:09,510
I completely heard the wrong thing.

2452
02:30:11,970 --> 02:30:13,210
There's the launcher.

2453
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:23,600
Oh, I see him up there.

2454
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:26,640
I got you.

2455
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:28,940
Backing you up, buddy.

2456
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:30,480
Oh my goodness.

2457
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:31,640
I'm charging.

2458
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:32,960
I'm charging.

2459
02:30:33,580 --> 02:30:35,200
I'm charging my bank account.

2460
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:39,280
The music is so cool here though.

2461
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:42,800
Can I get that guy?

2462
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:45,300
I think that hit.

2463
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:52,840
Ration.

2464
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:54,360
I'll take that.

2465
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:01,090
What's over here?

2466
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:05,490
I bought music.

2467
02:31:06,450 --> 02:31:07,190
Wait, where?

2468
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:11,270
Sailor.

2469
02:31:12,130 --> 02:31:15,710
Healing music that can be heard by calling a secret radio frequency in the game.

2470
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:21,890
I got you.

2471
02:31:22,990 --> 02:31:24,250
I'm backing that up.

2472
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:29,160
I think I'm getting this guy.

2473
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:31,660
Oh wait, that's my friend.

2474
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:32,200
Sorry.

2475
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:32,260
Sorry.

2476
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:35,460
Guys?

2477
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:42,200
I'm one of the baddies now.

2478
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:46,960
But I've always been a baddie.

2479
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:48,340
Oh, these are my friends.

2480
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:48,580
Cool.

2481
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:55,240
I'm helping?

2482
02:31:56,220 --> 02:31:56,600
Maybe.

2483
02:31:56,600 --> 02:31:56,680
Maybe?

2484
02:31:58,980 --> 02:31:59,220
Cover!

2485
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:06,290
Oh my gosh, please.

2486
02:32:08,350 --> 02:32:10,330
Can I please hit a guy?

2487
02:32:10,730 --> 02:32:12,010
Please can I shoot a man?

2488
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:14,410
Yeah, baby!

2489
02:32:16,730 --> 02:32:17,610
Yeah, I did.

2490
02:32:17,730 --> 02:32:18,170
You're welcome.

2491
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:24,880
Back that up.

2492
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,800
There's a guy right there.

2493
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:28,720
How do I get him?

2494
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:29,800
Seriously?

2495
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:36,280
Ass saved.

2496
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:39,380
You are welcome.

2497
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:40,640
Grenade!

2498
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:52,690
I can't tell if some of these guys are the ones that I put to sleep and they just didn't...

2499
02:32:52,690 --> 02:32:55,790
They just didn't...

2500
02:32:55,790 --> 02:32:56,370
Oh my goodness!

2501
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:02,580
Can I get yourself?

2502
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:07,840
Alright, I'm off to find a lady friend.

2503
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:09,940
You guys, good luck with everything else.

2504
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:15,560
Good luck with everything else.

2505
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:18,240
I will see you around.

2506
02:33:19,860 --> 02:33:20,520
Probably.

2507
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:25,800
She's a friend.

2508
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:30,070
Friend is definitely a strong word, you know, obviously, but...

2509
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:34,210
She's over in here.

2510
02:33:37,490 --> 02:33:39,610
Don't quite remember how to get there.

2511
02:33:40,070 --> 02:33:40,430
Hey, snake.

2512
02:33:43,750 --> 02:33:45,190
Hi, snake.

2513
02:33:49,530 --> 02:33:50,850
Over where?

2514
02:33:50,970 --> 02:33:51,410
Under...

2515
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:52,790
Under where?

2516
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:13,070
Oh gosh!

2517
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:15,330
Catching strays.

2518
02:34:16,190 --> 02:34:16,670
From where?

2519
02:34:18,230 --> 02:34:18,950
From where?

2520
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:21,970
Oh my goodness, there they are.

2521
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:38,480
Guys, do you remember?

2522
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:42,160
Do you remember?

2523
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:48,220
Is it inside?

2524
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:52,460
I thought she was in a different building.

2525
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:54,860
Like she's in her own little, like, shed.

2526
02:34:59,750 --> 02:35:01,850
Uh oh, my friends are dying.

2527
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:03,570
Damn.

2528
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:13,420
Missed the gun.

2529
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:17,460
It's a hole, you go inside.

2530
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:20,540
Thank you, I can't remember.

2531
02:35:25,950 --> 02:35:27,370
Back me up.

2532
02:35:31,150 --> 02:35:31,290
Yeah?

2533
02:35:33,170 --> 02:35:33,490
Hello?

2534
02:35:34,410 --> 02:35:35,530
Hey, hello.

2535
02:35:36,390 --> 02:35:37,510
Oh gosh, no!

2536
02:35:39,250 --> 02:35:39,670
Shoot!

2537
02:35:40,090 --> 02:35:40,330
Shoot!

2538
02:35:41,630 --> 02:35:42,630
Oh gosh.

2539
02:35:43,010 --> 02:35:43,550
Go inside, snake.

2540
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:49,110
Let me see.

2541
02:35:49,110 --> 02:35:49,190
Let me see.

2542
02:35:51,130 --> 02:35:53,350
We're fine for now.

2543
02:36:00,830 --> 02:36:01,550
Yeah!

2544
02:36:07,890 --> 02:36:08,690
Oh my gosh!

2545
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:12,430
Hold on, let me get my... I got a knife too.

2546
02:36:13,190 --> 02:36:13,990
I got one also.

2547
02:36:16,490 --> 02:36:16,870
Yeah!

2548
02:36:17,110 --> 02:36:17,550
Stab!

2549
02:36:21,570 --> 02:36:22,170
Yeah!

2550
02:36:22,330 --> 02:36:22,750
Stab him!

2551
02:36:23,790 --> 02:36:25,310
That works.

2552
02:36:25,690 --> 02:36:28,290
That works.

2553
02:36:29,910 --> 02:36:30,670
Whatever.

2554
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:36,780
What's this?

2555
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:38,320
Got a ration.

2556
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:39,760
Cool.

2557
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:41,760
We're running.

2558
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:44,000
I'm making a mess.

2559
02:36:46,340 --> 02:36:47,440
Anybody up here?

2560
02:36:48,380 --> 02:36:48,820
No one?

2561
02:36:53,710 --> 02:36:54,470
Okay.

2562
02:36:55,330 --> 02:36:56,090
Alright.

2563
02:36:59,180 --> 02:36:59,720
Oh, what's that?

2564
02:37:08,980 --> 02:37:09,940
Oh, what's this?

2565
02:37:10,220 --> 02:37:11,400
Sorry, I keep missing stuff.

2566
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:13,580
Oh, I'm full.

2567
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:16,120
Let's try...

2568
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:18,680
Doing that.

2569
02:37:22,770 --> 02:37:24,070
I think we got it.

2570
02:37:31,330 --> 02:37:31,810
Claymore.

2571
02:37:34,290 --> 02:37:36,550
Good luck everybody else, good luck friends.

2572
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:38,930
I believe in you all, I believe in you.

2573
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:40,990
I think you can do it.

2574
02:37:42,110 --> 02:37:46,830
lol Why not clay less?

2575
02:37:47,590 --> 02:37:49,230
Who would want to clay less?

2576
02:37:49,350 --> 02:37:49,690
Truly.

2577
02:37:58,750 --> 02:37:59,310
Nice.

2578
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:04,690
Snake's ass is great in this game.

2579
02:38:04,790 --> 02:38:07,290
It's literally the best it's ever been.

2580
02:38:07,830 --> 02:38:08,450
I think.

2581
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:10,730
It's the best that it's ever been.

2582
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:12,950
Oh, I was sweaty.

2583
02:38:16,610 --> 02:38:17,730
You okay, Snake?

2584
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:22,920
My golly!

2585
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:38,590
They won't let you leave, Naomi.

2586
02:38:44,170 --> 02:38:45,670
Oh gosh.

2587
02:38:58,650 --> 02:39:00,790
Just hearing her voice...

2588
02:39:01,490 --> 02:39:03,670
It's ruining my time.

2589
02:39:29,870 --> 02:39:31,890
Not a fan of Naomi?

2590
02:39:32,230 --> 02:39:32,450
No.

2591
02:39:37,230 --> 02:39:39,790
You could even say less... Oh my gosh, this hallway.

2592
02:39:41,230 --> 02:39:42,350
I remember it.

2593
02:39:42,570 --> 02:39:43,790
I remember this building well.

2594
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:47,330
I remember this building well.

2595
02:39:57,030 --> 02:39:58,810
Isn't there a secret L1 here?

2596
02:39:59,730 --> 02:40:00,630
I think I remember.

2597
02:40:05,270 --> 02:40:06,530
I'm just holding it down.

2598
02:40:13,930 --> 02:40:16,070
She got the IVS happening.

2599
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:21,110
You need a little...the prick?

2600
02:40:38,090 --> 02:40:40,470
Aren't you cold, lady?

2601
02:40:41,230 --> 02:40:45,070
I knew you'd come.

2602
02:40:47,930 --> 02:40:51,350
You and I, neither of us can escape our fate.

2603
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:57,200
I haven't seen you since Shadow Moses.

2604
02:40:57,460 --> 02:40:58,440
How long?

2605
02:40:58,860 --> 02:40:59,360
Ten years?

2606
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:01,120
Nine.

2607
02:41:01,880 --> 02:41:02,860
Nine years.

2608
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:04,860
And Dr. Emmerich, is he with you?

2609
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:06,400
Why?

2610
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:10,720
I thought he'd be the only one able to open the mail I sent.

2611
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:15,700
Not many people could recognize 4D sound data in a soliton radar file.

2612
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:19,680
How is the good doctor?

2613
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,220
How is the good doctor?

2614
02:41:22,580 --> 02:41:25,620
What happened to your accent, you fake?

2615
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:27,140
You are so fake, everything.

2616
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:32,260
Who were you just talking to?

2617
02:41:33,460 --> 02:41:33,940
Liquid.

2618
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,640
Although I suppose he's really Ocelot.

2619
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:38,380
From a medical standpoint.

2620
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:40,800
I thought he was here.

2621
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:43,540
Did you see her?

2622
02:41:45,020 --> 02:41:46,520
Did you see it?

2623
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:48,620
Did you see it?

2624
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:53,460
They know I won't escape.

2625
02:41:54,220 --> 02:41:55,860
I'm powerless to resist.

2626
02:41:56,800 --> 02:41:58,340
I have no choice but to cooperate.

2627
02:41:58,740 --> 02:42:00,480
She's kind of got an accent.

2628
02:42:02,400 --> 02:42:03,480
Oh, I'm powerless.

2629
02:42:04,580 --> 02:42:05,340
It's like barely.

2630
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:05,460
Barely.

2631
02:42:08,090 --> 02:42:09,620
I did not remember this building.

2632
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:10,380
Ah, yeah.

2633
02:42:11,860 --> 02:42:12,380
Oh, yeah.

2634
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:22,860
Mail?

2635
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:27,800
I'm sorry, I'm blocking her.

2636
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:29,560
The fan service.

2637
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:30,500
Sorry, everybody.

2638
02:42:30,500 --> 02:42:31,720
I'm scared.

2639
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:44,780
That's true.

2640
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:49,560
I give the people what they want.

2641
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:04,480
Oh, that's such a big needle.

2642
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:05,920
Oh my god.

2643
02:43:10,140 --> 02:43:10,720
Yeah.

2644
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:15,200
Snake ain't looking so hot.

2645
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:20,840
Snake is looking not so good.

2646
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:22,460
He's looking mighty pale.

2647
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:22,980
Hmm.

2648
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:30,500
Hormones.

2649
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:36,320
Yeah, I'm playing on my PS3.

2650
02:43:54,380 --> 02:43:55,780
Okay.

2651
02:43:59,460 --> 02:44:00,180
Crazy.

2652
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:25,720
Ooh, Naomi.

2653
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,640
This is a bad picture of you.

2654
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:37,720
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

2655
02:44:39,980 --> 02:44:42,520
Okay, her password is... how many...

2656
02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:44,460
How many digits was that, like 12?

2657
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:46,020
I think we can figure that out.

2658
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:49,840
I think we can get in there.

2659
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:58,320
Oh.

2660
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:07,460
Password is tight, but...

2661
02:45:10,380 --> 02:45:11,480
She can't stop thinking about Snake.

2662
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:24,620
Hmm.

2663
02:45:27,620 --> 02:45:29,180
What's that emotion?

2664
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:30,920
What is that one on the right?

2665
02:45:32,660 --> 02:45:34,460
He looks so... smoked?

2666
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:39,680
The fear.

2667
02:45:39,980 --> 02:45:40,640
That's the fear?

2668
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:40,740
Fear?

2669
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,580
Gray Fox?

2670
02:45:51,720 --> 02:45:52,580
So cool.

2671
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:53,820
Oh my god.

2672
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:00,060
Art is so good.

2673
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:16,720
My bit rate!

2674
02:46:26,560 --> 02:46:29,460
Those are all the games we played.

2675
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:30,400
Exciting.

2676
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:31,020
So cool.

2677
02:46:46,930 --> 02:46:49,290
Oh man.

2678
02:46:52,310 --> 02:46:53,790
Hey Snake.

2679
02:47:01,650 --> 02:47:04,830
Never change, Snake.

2680
02:47:04,910 --> 02:47:05,730
Never change.

2681
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:26,610
Hmm.

2682
02:47:27,130 --> 02:47:27,550
Hmm.

2683
02:47:28,630 --> 02:47:29,350
Oh my goodness.

2684
02:47:32,070 --> 02:47:33,010
Um...

2685
02:47:33,010 --> 02:47:35,030
I mean...

2686
02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:35,450
Hmm.

2687
02:47:39,310 --> 02:47:40,250
Oh!

2688
02:47:43,730 --> 02:47:45,090
Okay, ma'am.

2689
02:47:46,550 --> 02:47:49,850
But as long as you, you know...

2690
02:47:49,850 --> 02:47:51,110
Treat me well, okay?

2691
02:47:53,890 --> 02:47:54,690
Oh, Snake.

2692
02:47:56,390 --> 02:47:58,070
I hate this part, though.

2693
02:47:59,050 --> 02:48:00,030
I hate her.

2694
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:01,030
I hate her.

2695
02:48:03,170 --> 02:48:07,650
It's like your reaction is so crazy.

2696
02:48:15,610 --> 02:48:16,230
Snake...

2697
02:48:16,230 --> 02:48:17,510
He's just a guy.

2698
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:21,330
She's like going to throw up about him.

2699
02:48:32,290 --> 02:48:33,850
She's so rude.

2700
02:48:34,290 --> 02:48:36,070
Why are you crying at him?

2701
02:48:37,270 --> 02:48:43,810
You can tell he has accelerated aging and then you see his body and you just start sobbing.

2702
02:48:44,510 --> 02:48:46,290
It's so sad.

2703
02:49:06,350 --> 02:49:08,250
I hope I look that good when I'm old.

2704
02:49:08,370 --> 02:49:08,910
I know, right?

2705
02:49:10,070 --> 02:49:10,870
Look down.

2706
02:49:11,370 --> 02:49:12,330
He looks great.

2707
02:49:12,470 --> 02:49:16,350
I mean, I know he's not supposed to be old, but...

2708
02:49:16,350 --> 02:49:18,770
For someone who is old, he looks awesome.

2709
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:22,830
It's a granddaddy.

2710
02:49:25,610 --> 02:49:26,390
Oh, Snake.

2711
02:49:38,850 --> 02:49:42,070
He looks awesome.

2712
02:49:51,050 --> 02:49:51,750
Terminator.

2713
02:49:56,010 --> 02:49:57,410
Sorry.

2714
02:49:59,350 --> 02:50:00,390
Even though it's a guy.

2715
02:50:06,070 --> 02:50:12,070
It was a safety device to ensure that the seed of Big Boss didn't end up in the hands of others.

2716
02:50:13,190 --> 02:50:20,290
The reason you're aging so rapidly isn't because of disease or faulty research or fox die.

2717
02:50:21,350 --> 02:50:22,730
It's how you were born.

2718
02:50:24,310 --> 02:50:25,910
It's your natural lifespan.

2719
02:50:37,060 --> 02:50:37,900
It's depressing.

2720
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:38,800
I know.

2721
02:50:42,740 --> 02:50:46,280
I hate... I love and I hate this game.

2722
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:47,740
It's so sad.

2723
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:52,620
Okay, so we'll do a new save.

2724
02:50:58,220 --> 02:51:00,680
Just blame the genes like you always do, Naomi.

2725
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:03,160
So sad.

2726
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:18,910
The truth, Naomi.

2727
02:51:19,710 --> 02:51:21,430
Scanning for fellow Naomi heads.

2728
02:51:24,270 --> 02:51:26,610
You'll be added to a watch list of monitored men.

2729
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:41,190
Copying Solid Snake.

2730
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:50,510
The question she'll never answer.

2731
02:51:58,310 --> 02:51:59,110
At

2732
02:52:06,710 --> 02:52:09,770
least let the man have a cigarette.

2733
02:52:27,510 --> 02:52:28,190
What?

2734
02:52:38,830 --> 02:52:43,070
Whose fault is it that it's there in the first place?

2735
02:52:45,350 --> 02:52:48,410
She just loves not taking responsibility for anything.

2736
02:52:49,410 --> 02:52:51,730
Sorry, I just hate her so much.

2737
02:52:59,410 --> 02:53:01,710
But she's so hot.

2738
02:53:02,450 --> 02:53:04,830
She is a looker.

2739
02:53:19,210 --> 02:53:20,430
Remember those guys?

2740
02:53:25,710 --> 02:53:26,470
God, I hate Naomi.

2741
02:53:26,650 --> 02:53:27,190
Also Mint.

2742
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:29,090
It's not me, it's Snake.

2743
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:32,330
What?

2744
02:53:35,170 --> 02:53:36,350
The real liquid.

2745
02:53:48,530 --> 02:53:51,550
The virus is starting to mutate.

2746
02:53:55,090 --> 02:53:59,610
The viruses on the left are Foxtai in its original form.

2747
02:54:00,330 --> 02:54:02,770
The ones on the right I took from your body.

2748
02:54:03,090 --> 02:54:03,790
He's pregnant.

2749
02:54:06,310 --> 02:54:09,610
Snake is a freak, Mint is a freak, he tore a piece of a pod.

2750
02:54:09,750 --> 02:54:16,410
This mutated version of Foxtai could activate even if the infected person's genetic pattern doesn't perfectly match the receptors.

2751
02:54:18,450 --> 02:54:19,910
It does look like a pair of boobs.

2752
02:54:23,990 --> 02:54:25,610
I'm gonna eat some of my sandwich.

2753
02:54:25,990 --> 02:54:27,830
I hope it's okay while the cutscene is going.

2754
02:54:49,310 --> 02:54:53,210
It'll become a killer virus that attacks untold numbers of victims.

2755
02:54:54,870 --> 02:54:56,370
What if we kill them all?

2756
02:54:56,830 --> 02:54:57,890
Remove them from the body?

2757
02:54:58,930 --> 02:55:00,650
There are no antibodies either.

2758
02:55:02,690 --> 02:55:08,510
I don't know what percentage of the receptors have to break down or how many people will be targeted when that happens.

2759
02:55:09,550 --> 02:55:13,770
But what is certain is that people will begin to catch Foxtai through airborne transmission.

2760
02:55:14,930 --> 02:55:16,970
It'll start with those closest to you.

2761
02:55:16,970 --> 02:55:21,530
Then, one by one, they'll lose their lives.

2762
02:55:23,310 --> 02:55:29,150
The part of the virus that distinguishes between individuals will start to break down in about half a year.

2763
02:55:30,390 --> 02:55:30,910
No.

2764
02:55:31,530 --> 02:55:32,590
Wow, it's almost like we...

2765
02:55:32,590 --> 02:55:33,490
Three months at the most.

2766
02:55:34,150 --> 02:55:34,890
Three months?

2767
02:55:35,250 --> 02:55:42,870
It's almost like we should have, you know, not have used this weird experimental... something.

2768
02:55:43,510 --> 02:55:44,550
Nuclear annihilation.

2769
02:55:44,610 --> 02:55:45,710
Whatever this is, a weapon.

2770
02:55:45,710 --> 02:55:47,710
On a random person.

2771
02:55:50,730 --> 02:55:53,010
Yeah, and it's your fault, Naomi!

2772
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:54,410
You made this!

2773
02:55:54,530 --> 02:55:55,890
Don't blame Snake!

2774
02:55:57,750 --> 02:55:58,190
I can't.

2775
02:56:02,750 --> 02:56:05,070
Put him in a little bubble.

2776
02:56:09,890 --> 02:56:11,070
Jim Hausman's fault.

2777
02:56:11,230 --> 02:56:11,810
And Naomi.

2778
02:56:11,890 --> 02:56:13,430
Naomi followed through.

2779
02:56:13,430 --> 02:56:15,990
She takes all the blame as well.

2780
02:56:21,900 --> 02:56:24,220
This game hurts so bad, but I love the pain.

2781
02:56:25,260 --> 02:56:27,200
I know, it does hurt bad.

2782
02:56:50,290 --> 02:56:52,730
Will that stop FOXDIE from spreading?

2783
02:56:52,970 --> 02:56:53,190
No.

2784
02:56:56,890 --> 02:57:00,810
When the host dies, the virus dies with it.

2785
02:57:01,550 --> 02:57:03,750
You just want an excuse to kill Snake!

2786
02:57:20,210 --> 02:57:22,270
Finally, he gets his smoke.

2787
02:57:28,210 --> 02:57:31,050
Snake, tell me one more thing.

2788
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:36,510
Have you been to a hospital lately?

2789
02:57:37,750 --> 02:57:38,030
Yeah.

2790
02:57:38,590 --> 02:57:41,310
While you were there, did they give you an injection?

2791
02:57:42,050 --> 02:57:43,110
Don't they always?

2792
02:57:47,360 --> 02:57:48,580
Take a look at this.

2793
02:57:50,280 --> 02:57:52,060
These came out of your body as well.

2794
02:57:52,380 --> 02:57:52,900
Twins.

2795
02:57:53,580 --> 02:57:55,320
It's a new strain of FOXDIE.

2796
02:57:55,720 --> 02:57:56,720
One I've never seen.

2797
02:57:58,260 --> 02:58:00,100
Someone must have put them in you recently.

2798
02:58:01,160 --> 02:58:02,160
You have any idea who?

2799
02:58:03,900 --> 02:58:04,420
Him.

2800
02:58:12,620 --> 02:58:13,980
Ruh-roh.

2801
02:58:20,780 --> 02:58:23,620
I like that we just blindly trust her.

2802
02:58:28,540 --> 02:58:30,860
Snake just takes everything, huh?

2803
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:35,460
I mean, but who are you supposed to tell who you can believe?

2804
02:58:35,900 --> 02:58:36,960
Who you can trust?

2805
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:39,400
Especially in this series.

2806
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:43,660
Give a shot?

2807
02:58:43,760 --> 02:58:44,540
Ok, I'll do it.

2808
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:46,360
Oh, shoot me up too?

2809
02:58:46,440 --> 02:58:47,120
Ok, I got it.

2810
02:58:50,840 --> 02:58:51,260
Ok.

2811
02:58:53,560 --> 02:58:54,020
Ok.

2812
02:59:06,640 --> 02:59:08,400
Give me the drugs, Naomi.

2813
02:59:10,160 --> 02:59:12,400
I'll trust you lady who gave me a killer virus.

2814
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:13,240
Ok.

2815
02:59:21,740 --> 02:59:26,540
I let myself drown in my nanomachines and now I'm trapped by them.

2816
02:59:28,520 --> 02:59:30,040
Snake has to take more drugs than my grandpa.

2817
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:33,580
He is a grandpa.

2818
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:38,600
I can't slip free.

2819
02:59:44,870 --> 02:59:46,510
Then I'll free us both.

2820
02:59:47,770 --> 02:59:48,790
Where's Liquid?

2821
02:59:50,510 --> 02:59:52,090
I can't tell you yet.

2822
02:59:52,310 --> 02:59:52,570
What?

2823
02:59:52,830 --> 02:59:54,530
Not until you free me.

2824
02:59:55,250 --> 02:59:57,530
One must come before the other.

2825
03:00:03,430 --> 03:00:07,670
To release you, we must do the other.

2826
03:00:31,990 --> 03:00:33,650
He's being watched by us.

2827
03:00:47,450 --> 03:00:49,430
This is the first Metal Gear you played.

2828
03:00:50,350 --> 03:00:52,070
How did you know what was going on?

2829
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:01,650
Uh oh.

2830
03:01:07,870 --> 03:01:08,750
Uh oh.

2831
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:18,700
Guns of the Patriots.

2832
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:20,100
Gosh, I got something.

2833
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:22,460
I got like a little piece of pepper in my throat.

2834
03:01:26,620 --> 03:01:29,100
These are the guys that drop the big bucks.

2835
03:01:40,150 --> 03:01:41,670
She's the juggler.

2836
03:01:45,690 --> 03:01:47,770
Your Octocamo looked so good before.

2837
03:01:47,870 --> 03:01:48,750
Why is it bad now?

2838
03:02:13,580 --> 03:02:14,480
It's time.

2839
03:02:29,840 --> 03:02:32,200
I can't remember if I have to...

2840
03:02:34,720 --> 03:02:36,880
Hold on, I want to take a ration real quick.

2841
03:02:37,360 --> 03:02:39,200
I can't remember if I have to...

2842
03:02:41,400 --> 03:02:42,040
Use...

2843
03:02:42,040 --> 03:02:46,980
Obviously on Laughing Octopus, I have to use Tranquilizer.

2844
03:02:49,780 --> 03:02:50,420
But...

2845
03:02:50,420 --> 03:02:51,300
It's time to farm.

2846
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:52,780
Yeah, I think this is where we farm.

2847
03:02:53,100 --> 03:02:53,520
For real.

2848
03:02:54,540 --> 03:02:55,340
But how?

2849
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:56,600
I don't remember.

2850
03:02:57,580 --> 03:02:58,220
Where are they?

2851
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:01,660
Froggies!

2852
03:03:06,850 --> 03:03:07,490
Here?

2853
03:03:10,450 --> 03:03:12,390
I'm at 83% camo.

2854
03:03:16,290 --> 03:03:16,690
Oh.

2855
03:03:17,390 --> 03:03:17,790
It

2856
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:40,420
didn't give me as much as I thought it would though.

2857
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:43,080
Oh my gosh.

2858
03:03:48,010 --> 03:03:51,410
It didn't give me as much money as I expected it to.

2859
03:03:58,080 --> 03:03:59,340
Back it up, back it up.

2860
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:02,900
Like, it gives me 1500.

2861
03:04:02,900 --> 03:04:03,100
1500.

2862
03:04:09,400 --> 03:04:11,640
But I think they are just non-stop.

2863
03:04:12,940 --> 03:04:14,580
There's like an X on my map.

2864
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:19,600
Yeah, it's like not very much at all.

2865
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:24,680
I thought that these were supposed to be the ones that were 12,000.

2866
03:04:28,500 --> 03:04:30,500
I wonder if that other area was the one.

2867
03:04:31,240 --> 03:04:33,320
Farming is done at the confinement facility.

2868
03:04:34,640 --> 03:04:35,920
Was that the last place I was at?

2869
03:04:36,160 --> 03:04:38,500
The one that dropped the...

2870
03:04:40,400 --> 03:04:43,600
The one that... So, I probably did miss my chance then.

2871
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:47,640
What's the confinement...

2872
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:48,620
Mod, where is that?

2873
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:51,340
Where am

2874
03:04:55,690 --> 03:04:58,370
I?

2875
03:05:01,610 --> 03:05:03,850
End of game is way better farming.

2876
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:06,190
I know, but this...

2877
03:05:06,190 --> 03:05:08,390
Well, yeah, but...

2878
03:05:08,390 --> 03:05:11,010
I wanted to get it sooner rather than later.

2879
03:05:12,170 --> 03:05:15,430
You know, I wanted to get the good stuff...

2880
03:05:15,430 --> 03:05:15,970
Now.

2881
03:05:17,830 --> 03:05:19,870
I wanted to get...

2882
03:05:19,870 --> 03:05:22,210
Oh man, why 4 million?

2883
03:05:22,410 --> 03:05:23,510
Why 5 million?

2884
03:05:24,550 --> 03:05:25,350
And...

2885
03:05:25,350 --> 03:05:28,750
It has like a watchtower and barbed wire walls.

2886
03:05:31,050 --> 03:05:33,510
So, the place I was at...

2887
03:05:35,350 --> 03:05:37,670
Okay, we'll figure it out.

2888
03:05:49,010 --> 03:05:50,050
Oh shoot.

2889
03:05:52,130 --> 03:05:53,750
Can you like...

2890
03:05:55,650 --> 03:05:56,450
Hello?

2891
03:06:00,090 --> 03:06:00,990
Wake up.

2892
03:06:03,630 --> 03:06:04,690
Not, not wake up.

2893
03:06:05,030 --> 03:06:07,590
No, that's the opposite of what I want you to do actually.

2894
03:06:09,890 --> 03:06:10,790
Where are you?

2895
03:06:12,450 --> 03:06:13,250
Come on in.

2896
03:06:17,060 --> 03:06:18,480
Whichever way you choose.

2897
03:06:19,340 --> 03:06:19,540
Madam?

2898
03:06:24,660 --> 03:06:25,180
Madam?

2899
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:26,240
Madam?

2900
03:06:26,920 --> 03:06:27,180
Madam?

2901
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:27,900
Madam?

2902
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:35,220
Got your booty.

2903
03:06:44,270 --> 03:06:45,870
Oh, no, that is not all of them.

2904
03:06:46,450 --> 03:06:47,750
More definitely just came in.

2905
03:06:48,050 --> 03:06:50,150
So yeah, this must be like a...

2906
03:06:50,150 --> 03:06:53,190
But you can farm here, because they're like...

2907
03:06:53,190 --> 03:06:54,230
They don't...

2908
03:06:54,230 --> 03:06:56,590
They don't stop coming and they don't stop coming.

2909
03:06:56,830 --> 03:07:01,570
I really thought it was the froggies that were supposed to be the ones that drop the good money.

2910
03:07:02,030 --> 03:07:02,850
I'm so upset.

2911
03:07:05,050 --> 03:07:05,890
Sorry guys.

2912
03:07:08,010 --> 03:07:09,970
I didn't do my research well enough.

2913
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:16,120
They do indeed stop coming.

2914
03:07:16,380 --> 03:07:16,800
They do.

2915
03:07:17,500 --> 03:07:17,920
Eventually.

2916
03:07:31,620 --> 03:07:33,440
I think I missed this one.

2917
03:07:34,600 --> 03:07:35,660
Where was the other one?

2918
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:38,300
Oh my gosh, the standing scared me.

2919
03:07:39,660 --> 03:07:40,380
This is locked.

2920
03:07:43,140 --> 03:07:43,900
Sell for money.

2921
03:07:54,810 --> 03:07:55,670
One moment.

2922
03:08:07,060 --> 03:08:07,620
Snake!

2923
03:08:07,620 --> 03:08:07,900
Oh gosh.

2924
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:10,740
That scared the heck out of me.

2925
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:13,900
That scared me.

2926
03:08:17,560 --> 03:08:19,240
I was just gonna head to the point.

2927
03:08:20,020 --> 03:08:20,640
Oh my goodness.

2928
03:08:24,300 --> 03:08:28,900
I could have sworn I did all the beauties...

2929
03:08:28,900 --> 03:08:30,420
Non-lethally.

2930
03:08:30,740 --> 03:08:31,820
Or most of them.

2931
03:08:31,880 --> 03:08:34,440
I know I did for sure like this lady.

2932
03:08:34,440 --> 03:08:36,880
But I don't understand why I don't have her statue.

2933
03:08:37,020 --> 03:08:38,280
Maybe I missed picking it up.

2934
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:43,420
The photo mode?

2935
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:48,620
It's like a time limit though, right?

2936
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:01,660
Get the iPod ready.

2937
03:09:06,520 --> 03:09:07,320
Language!

2938
03:09:10,180 --> 03:09:10,880
Belly button.

2939
03:09:20,620 --> 03:09:22,700
It changes my gun.

2940
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:23,680
That's so messed up.

2941
03:09:27,160 --> 03:09:27,780
Ah!

2942
03:09:28,340 --> 03:09:28,800
Ah!

2943
03:09:29,240 --> 03:09:29,720
Ah!

2944
03:09:33,880 --> 03:09:35,560
That's like no damage.

2945
03:09:36,600 --> 03:09:37,540
Wait, hold on.

2946
03:09:37,820 --> 03:09:39,760
What other tranq stuff do I have?

2947
03:09:43,620 --> 03:09:45,240
Get out of here, operator.

2948
03:09:46,840 --> 03:09:50,340
I don't think I... I think besides...

2949
03:09:53,970 --> 03:09:55,210
Besides this...

2950
03:09:57,450 --> 03:09:59,230
I don't think I have anything.

2951
03:10:00,450 --> 03:10:01,970
The shotty has a non-lethal ammo?

2952
03:10:02,370 --> 03:10:02,970
Does it really?

2953
03:10:17,310 --> 03:10:19,930
Wait, let me see if I have... if I can get it.

2954
03:10:20,290 --> 03:10:21,110
Dreb and shop.

2955
03:10:23,830 --> 03:10:24,310
Ammo.

2956
03:10:25,210 --> 03:10:26,330
They taunt me.

2957
03:10:27,950 --> 03:10:29,490
Custom par... Oh, here we go.

2958
03:10:38,780 --> 03:10:39,380
This?

2959
03:10:43,140 --> 03:10:43,940
This one?

2960
03:10:45,280 --> 03:10:48,080
We can do it with the twin barrel, maybe?

2961
03:10:50,300 --> 03:10:50,600
Ok.

2962
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:54,160
What else is there?

2963
03:10:55,760 --> 03:10:56,800
These ones too.

2964
03:10:57,620 --> 03:10:58,180
Nice.

2965
03:10:59,540 --> 03:11:01,260
I'm just going to blast her with RPG.

2966
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:05,320
Ok, let's get like...

2967
03:11:08,770 --> 03:11:10,470
Can I only...

2968
03:11:11,070 --> 03:11:13,650
It will only let me buy...

2969
03:11:15,550 --> 03:11:16,210
One round.

2970
03:11:16,310 --> 03:11:16,570
Why?

2971
03:11:18,970 --> 03:11:19,730
Are you out?

2972
03:11:22,370 --> 03:11:23,590
Dreb, is this all you got?

2973
03:11:29,150 --> 03:11:29,510
No!

2974
03:11:34,540 --> 03:11:35,540
I'm full of ammo.

2975
03:11:35,800 --> 03:11:36,520
Oh, wait, hold on.

2976
03:11:36,640 --> 03:11:37,280
One moment, lady.

2977
03:11:37,600 --> 03:11:38,920
Hold on, I have to switch out my stuff.

2978
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:41,760
We don't need the railgun.

2979
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:43,880
Ok, what are we going to use?

2980
03:11:45,820 --> 03:11:47,200
Where is it?

2981
03:11:48,340 --> 03:11:48,900
Under...

2982
03:11:48,900 --> 03:11:49,540
Oh, here we go.

2983
03:11:50,260 --> 03:11:51,700
Twin barrel might be good, right?

2984
03:11:51,840 --> 03:11:52,880
I think...

2985
03:11:52,880 --> 03:11:54,780
Probably double barrel shotgun.

2986
03:11:55,220 --> 03:11:55,360
Ok.

2987
03:11:57,660 --> 03:11:59,760
And we switch the ammo on it.

2988
03:12:01,100 --> 03:12:02,040
The V-ring.

2989
03:12:05,200 --> 03:12:06,040
V-ring.

2990
03:12:06,620 --> 03:12:07,980
Vortex ring shot.

2991
03:12:09,740 --> 03:12:10,300
Ok.

2992
03:12:11,940 --> 03:12:12,840
Ma'am?

2993
03:12:15,980 --> 03:12:17,100
I'm scared.

2994
03:12:19,720 --> 03:12:21,920
She does like to hide and seek, right?

2995
03:12:31,880 --> 03:12:32,440
Gosh!

2996
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:35,580
Oh my god, that scared the heck out of me!

2997
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:37,080
Holy!

2998
03:12:38,340 --> 03:12:40,740
We are recovering some health from being here.

2999
03:12:42,740 --> 03:12:44,940
Hold on, let me recover health real quick.

3000
03:12:46,780 --> 03:12:48,600
She disappeared on my radar.

3001
03:12:53,790 --> 03:12:54,150
Ok.

3002
03:12:54,410 --> 03:12:56,150
Sorry, I have to remember how to do this fight.

3003
03:12:58,590 --> 03:13:00,690
She like goes into hiding, you know?

3004
03:13:00,790 --> 03:13:01,450
She is an octopus.

3005
03:13:01,990 --> 03:13:03,350
We are recovering health, which is good.

3006
03:13:03,450 --> 03:13:04,970
I don't have to use a...

3007
03:13:10,450 --> 03:13:11,930
I think I know where you are though.

3008
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:30,060
Did she see me?

3009
03:13:35,950 --> 03:13:36,450
Damn it.

3010
03:13:36,870 --> 03:13:37,410
I forgot.

3011
03:13:39,470 --> 03:13:39,730
Damn it.

3012
03:13:49,400 --> 03:13:51,000
Ma'am?

3013
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:51,640
Oh there you are.

3014
03:13:56,550 --> 03:13:58,070
What are you doing?

3015
03:13:59,690 --> 03:14:00,690
What are you doing?

3016
03:14:01,490 --> 03:14:02,710
Stop breaking everything!

3017
03:14:03,030 --> 03:14:04,370
Oh my god.

3018
03:14:07,570 --> 03:14:08,370
Reload!

3019
03:14:13,560 --> 03:14:17,430
Did she see me?

3020
03:14:27,930 --> 03:14:28,410
Hell yeah!

3021
03:14:31,630 --> 03:14:32,530
Reload!

3022
03:14:37,550 --> 03:14:38,790
Oh damn!

3023
03:14:39,910 --> 03:14:40,510
Reload!

3024
03:14:45,780 --> 03:14:47,020
I got you too!

3025
03:14:48,080 --> 03:14:48,980
Reload!

3026
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:51,580
Oh shoot.

3027
03:14:58,030 --> 03:14:58,930
Reload!

3028
03:14:59,190 --> 03:15:00,250
Oh shoot, it's these...

3029
03:15:10,070 --> 03:15:14,820
Is that her?

3030
03:15:16,480 --> 03:15:18,200
Oh, that's awkward.

3031
03:15:20,520 --> 03:15:20,960
Uh...

3032
03:15:31,430 --> 03:15:33,230
Let's do a...

3033
03:15:33,230 --> 03:15:33,850
Ration?

3034
03:15:37,610 --> 03:15:38,930
Wait, I want my solidite.

3035
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:39,490
There we go.

3036
03:15:39,630 --> 03:15:39,930
Thank you.

3037
03:15:42,590 --> 03:15:43,450
Smoky again.

3038
03:15:45,390 --> 03:15:45,830
OK!

3039
03:15:46,810 --> 03:15:47,890
It's these things, right?

3040
03:15:47,990 --> 03:15:48,490
Yeah, yeah.

3041
03:15:48,690 --> 03:15:50,830
OK, I hear her over maybe this side.

3042
03:15:57,350 --> 03:15:58,670
Where are you?

3043
03:15:59,610 --> 03:16:00,950
Something wrong?

3044
03:16:01,870 --> 03:16:02,650
Where are you?

3045
03:16:03,990 --> 03:16:04,570
Hello?

3046
03:16:05,570 --> 03:16:06,370
Give me a hint?

3047
03:16:08,950 --> 03:16:09,330
Where?

3048
03:16:11,370 --> 03:16:12,170
Where are you?

3049
03:16:13,790 --> 03:16:15,610
You sound so close.

3050
03:16:16,290 --> 03:16:16,790
I'm blind?

3051
03:16:16,970 --> 03:16:17,510
Wait, hold on.

3052
03:16:21,530 --> 03:16:22,810
Night vision.

3053
03:16:23,630 --> 03:16:25,430
I thought I had like a thermal vision.

3054
03:16:26,450 --> 03:16:27,830
Oh my gosh.

3055
03:16:29,250 --> 03:16:30,110
Where?

3056
03:16:33,330 --> 03:16:34,190
Where?

3057
03:16:34,870 --> 03:16:36,070
I'm blind.

3058
03:16:37,590 --> 03:16:38,570
I'm actually blind.

3059
03:16:39,290 --> 03:16:40,270
I'm actually blind.

3060
03:16:41,850 --> 03:16:43,610
Where are you?

3061
03:16:45,830 --> 03:16:47,190
My eyes?

3062
03:16:47,370 --> 03:16:47,830
Yeah, me too.

3063
03:16:49,430 --> 03:16:49,870
Hello?

3064
03:16:53,730 --> 03:16:55,150
Where are you?

3065
03:16:55,150 --> 03:16:58,510
Ma'am, I think I'm blind.

3066
03:16:58,590 --> 03:16:59,190
Can I get a hint?

3067
03:17:00,990 --> 03:17:01,530
Look up?

3068
03:17:02,710 --> 03:17:04,470
Oh my gosh.

3069
03:17:20,570 --> 03:17:21,170
Hello?

3070
03:17:22,970 --> 03:17:23,570
Hello?

3071
03:17:24,430 --> 03:17:24,830
Again?

3072
03:17:28,950 --> 03:17:29,850
Minto gaming?

3073
03:17:30,130 --> 03:17:30,710
Not really.

3074
03:17:30,710 --> 03:17:30,770
OK.

3075
03:17:33,570 --> 03:17:35,730
Hold on, let's do night vision again.

3076
03:17:35,790 --> 03:17:36,270
Sorry guys.

3077
03:17:36,470 --> 03:17:37,190
My eyes.

3078
03:17:40,510 --> 03:17:40,870
Yeah?

3079
03:17:41,890 --> 03:17:42,990
What are you doing in there?

3080
03:17:44,770 --> 03:17:45,770
Sorry, one second.

3081
03:17:47,070 --> 03:17:48,130
Are you on the other side?

3082
03:17:48,270 --> 03:17:49,190
Are you clipping through the wall?

3083
03:17:51,210 --> 03:17:52,630
How am I supposed to get her out of there?

3084
03:17:57,050 --> 03:17:58,430
Oh, I think maybe like here.

3085
03:17:58,430 --> 03:17:59,570
What?

3086
03:18:00,650 --> 03:18:01,870
Aim lower.

3087
03:18:03,190 --> 03:18:05,290
There we go.

3088
03:18:07,790 --> 03:18:09,190
Smokey!

3089
03:18:11,650 --> 03:18:13,530
Oh my gosh.

3090
03:18:20,420 --> 03:18:21,500
You bitch!

3091
03:18:27,180 --> 03:18:30,220
Where did she go?

3092
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:34,700
Get on top.

3093
03:18:37,300 --> 03:18:38,320
Oh dammit.

3094
03:18:38,620 --> 03:18:39,200
Oh,

3095
03:18:45,850 --> 03:18:47,710
these things again.

3096
03:18:47,830 --> 03:18:47,990
OK.

3097
03:18:49,150 --> 03:18:49,890
I heard her.

3098
03:18:50,010 --> 03:18:50,690
I heard her.

3099
03:18:52,530 --> 03:18:53,870
Oh my gosh.

3100
03:18:54,030 --> 03:18:54,350
No!

3101
03:18:54,970 --> 03:18:56,310
Don't explode on me!

3102
03:18:59,130 --> 03:18:59,730
Snake.

3103
03:19:01,450 --> 03:19:02,050
Yes?

3104
03:19:02,050 --> 03:19:03,030
Where are you?

3105
03:19:04,130 --> 03:19:04,530
Yeah?

3106
03:19:06,630 --> 03:19:08,510
This is so...

3107
03:19:08,510 --> 03:19:10,290
I'm so bad at this battle.

3108
03:19:10,450 --> 03:19:11,130
That's not her.

3109
03:19:12,730 --> 03:19:13,430
It's not me.

3110
03:19:19,310 --> 03:19:22,170
It is you.

3111
03:19:25,550 --> 03:19:26,710
Sorry.

3112
03:19:27,370 --> 03:19:28,670
Oh my god!

3113
03:19:29,770 --> 03:19:32,990
Oh my god!

3114
03:19:34,290 --> 03:19:35,630
Scared the hell out of me!

3115
03:19:42,100 --> 03:19:43,260
Yeah!

3116
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:44,720
Take that!

3117
03:19:44,720 --> 03:19:45,720
Dang it.

3118
03:19:45,820 --> 03:19:46,760
It's not the ball.

3119
03:19:46,820 --> 03:19:47,280
Not the ball!

3120
03:19:48,800 --> 03:19:49,240
A

3121
03:20:08,180 --> 03:20:09,580
little bit more left to go, which is great.

3122
03:20:12,100 --> 03:20:12,540
No!

3123
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:14,640
You're not... You're not...

3124
03:20:17,250 --> 03:20:18,450
Oh my god!

3125
03:20:25,400 --> 03:20:25,840
Sorry.

3126
03:20:26,220 --> 03:20:27,100
It's so scary.

3127
03:20:30,440 --> 03:20:33,140
It's so scary when she just...

3128
03:20:33,980 --> 03:20:36,940
And then the music... And then she's laughing.

3129
03:20:40,560 --> 03:20:42,340
No, that's not Anika.

3130
03:20:43,100 --> 03:20:43,660
Ma'am.

3131
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:45,120
Where are you?

3132
03:20:45,360 --> 03:20:45,840
Oh goodness.

3133
03:20:46,380 --> 03:20:46,960
Where are you?

3134
03:20:49,440 --> 03:20:50,660
What is that sound?

3135
03:20:51,200 --> 03:20:52,000
Oh my eyes.

3136
03:20:57,530 --> 03:20:57,850
Yeah?

3137
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:11,080
Is that you?

3138
03:21:16,400 --> 03:21:19,960
A little bit more.

3139
03:21:20,200 --> 03:21:20,800
We're almost there.

3140
03:21:26,550 --> 03:21:26,750
Oops.

3141
03:21:27,170 --> 03:21:27,450
My bad.

3142
03:21:38,130 --> 03:21:38,930
No shit!

3143
03:21:39,070 --> 03:21:39,410
Otacon!

3144
03:21:42,130 --> 03:21:43,230
She's in the ceilings!

3145
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:45,730
She was.

3146
03:21:46,070 --> 03:21:46,210
Wait.

3147
03:21:46,330 --> 03:21:46,670
Oh shoot.

3148
03:21:46,790 --> 03:21:47,090
Oh my god.

3149
03:21:47,930 --> 03:21:48,210
OK.

3150
03:21:48,410 --> 03:21:48,990
We're dancing.

3151
03:21:50,430 --> 03:21:51,290
I go one way.

3152
03:21:51,350 --> 03:21:51,990
You go the other way.

3153
03:21:52,310 --> 03:21:52,650
That's OK.

3154
03:21:53,130 --> 03:21:53,610
Works for me.

3155
03:21:54,310 --> 03:21:55,450
I think I missed my shot.

3156
03:21:55,450 --> 03:21:56,850
Damn it.

3157
03:22:00,770 --> 03:22:02,770
Oh my gosh!

3158
03:22:03,710 --> 03:22:05,170
Come on!

3159
03:22:11,440 --> 03:22:12,140
OK.

3160
03:22:14,680 --> 03:22:15,500
No more hiding out?

3161
03:22:18,660 --> 03:22:20,060
Bye!

3162
03:22:22,740 --> 03:22:23,760
Oh bye!

3163
03:22:27,740 --> 03:22:28,780
Oh damn!

3164
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:30,040
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

3165
03:22:43,020 --> 03:22:44,480
I still wanted to get the shot.

3166
03:22:44,580 --> 03:22:45,580
I still wanted to get the shot.

3167
03:22:47,200 --> 03:22:47,720
OK.

3168
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:51,340
We're mostly OK maybe on... Oh my goodness.

3169
03:22:51,480 --> 03:22:52,220
On health for now.

3170
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:56,140
Awesome!

3171
03:23:11,690 --> 03:23:12,850
We're almost there.

3172
03:23:12,910 --> 03:23:13,630
We're almost there.

3173
03:23:15,270 --> 03:23:17,950
She's gonna probably come through the ceiling again here, right?

3174
03:23:18,170 --> 03:23:18,490
Yup.

3175
03:23:20,890 --> 03:23:21,910
Oh damn it!

3176
03:23:21,990 --> 03:23:22,250
Damn it!

3177
03:23:22,270 --> 03:23:22,510
Damn it!

3178
03:23:22,550 --> 03:23:22,730
Damn it!

3179
03:23:22,930 --> 03:23:25,270
Oh my gosh.

3180
03:23:25,730 --> 03:23:25,950
OK.

3181
03:23:26,350 --> 03:23:27,050
Ration time.

3182
03:23:30,570 --> 03:23:31,490
And reload.

3183
03:23:32,710 --> 03:23:33,870
And what is she gonna do?

3184
03:23:35,610 --> 03:23:36,950
We got... Oh my gosh.

3185
03:23:37,010 --> 03:23:37,410
So close.

3186
03:23:38,250 --> 03:23:38,870
So close.

3187
03:23:38,870 --> 03:23:41,250
Damn it.

3188
03:23:41,730 --> 03:23:42,450
Come on lady.

3189
03:23:42,650 --> 03:23:43,490
Are you gonna come down through here?

3190
03:23:44,530 --> 03:23:45,050
Where are you?

3191
03:23:45,210 --> 03:23:46,010
Oh man.

3192
03:23:46,370 --> 03:23:48,110
The way she like moonwalks.

3193
03:23:49,170 --> 03:23:49,790
Ma'am?

3194
03:23:50,230 --> 03:23:51,390
Which way are you coming from?

3195
03:23:56,770 --> 03:23:57,590
Oh, there you are.

3196
03:23:58,190 --> 03:23:58,890
Oh, never mind.

3197
03:23:59,430 --> 03:24:00,150
There you go.

3198
03:24:05,030 --> 03:24:05,950
I'll come to you.

3199
03:24:06,050 --> 03:24:06,610
You come to me.

3200
03:24:06,870 --> 03:24:07,770
What you, what you, what you, what you?

3201
03:24:08,950 --> 03:24:09,970
Left or right to push?

3202
03:24:10,330 --> 03:24:11,070
Oh, there you are.

3203
03:24:14,150 --> 03:24:15,270
And... Oh, never mind.

3204
03:24:16,350 --> 03:24:16,870
Fight me!

3205
03:24:17,830 --> 03:24:18,530
Fight me!

3206
03:24:21,770 --> 03:24:22,250
No.

3207
03:24:24,370 --> 03:24:26,370
I like that I can just get on the bed here.

3208
03:24:28,950 --> 03:24:30,070
Oh my gosh.

3209
03:24:30,130 --> 03:24:30,570
So close.

3210
03:24:34,050 --> 03:24:35,010
And she's down.

3211
03:24:35,690 --> 03:24:36,390
Again.

3212
03:24:38,310 --> 03:24:39,430
And she's back.

3213
03:24:45,050 --> 03:24:46,450
Is

3214
03:25:00,490 --> 03:25:05,650
it sexy hour?

3215
03:25:07,690 --> 03:25:09,750
Time for the two set checkie.

3216
03:25:17,940 --> 03:25:20,740
So icky.

3217
03:25:20,740 --> 03:25:20,960
Icky.

3218
03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:24,620
I love the thing on her head.

3219
03:25:25,140 --> 03:25:27,540
It looks so much like, like Ray.

3220
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:33,120
No.

3221
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:41,280
And I'm Minto.

3222
03:25:59,820 --> 03:26:04,200
I think she's my favorite of all of them, to be honest.

3223
03:26:16,840 --> 03:26:18,280
She's really cute.

3224
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:23,300
Hilarious, even.

3225
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:27,200
Wow!

3226
03:26:31,310 --> 03:26:35,590
When you're a deranged babe, but you still got time to do your makeup in the morning.

3227
03:26:41,860 --> 03:26:43,420
Got that smokey eye.

3228
03:26:53,040 --> 03:26:54,280
Can't stop laughing.

3229
03:26:54,780 --> 03:26:55,700
Won't stop laughing.

3230
03:27:00,460 --> 03:27:00,880
Oh.

3231
03:27:06,340 --> 03:27:09,380
It just pushes her over.

3232
03:27:12,440 --> 03:27:13,980
Uh oh, the voices.

3233
03:27:13,980 --> 03:27:15,080
I'm scared.

3234
03:27:15,860 --> 03:27:17,820
I'm really scared.

3235
03:27:37,210 --> 03:27:39,230
Waiting for the twit longer.

3236
03:27:40,670 --> 03:27:42,670
We need the sorry I laughed apology.

3237
03:27:42,670 --> 03:27:42,690
Sorry.

3238
03:27:47,850 --> 03:27:49,390
Uh oh, did it again.

3239
03:27:49,790 --> 03:27:51,090
We're gonna have to punish you, girl.

3240
03:27:52,570 --> 03:27:54,890
Oh, you don't want to laugh, but you're laughing, girl.

3241
03:28:07,580 --> 03:28:10,380
I don't remember how to go into the...

3242
03:28:10,380 --> 03:28:13,420
I can't believe I keep switching my gun.

3243
03:28:13,500 --> 03:28:14,380
It's kind of messed up.

3244
03:28:16,260 --> 03:28:16,760
Yeah.

3245
03:28:19,940 --> 03:28:20,920
The statue.

3246
03:28:21,220 --> 03:28:22,340
Do I have to get it now?

3247
03:28:22,980 --> 03:28:23,560
Oh my goodness.

3248
03:28:25,200 --> 03:28:28,260
Do I have to get it now?

3249
03:28:32,260 --> 03:28:32,760
Hello.

3250
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:34,910
She like avoids my...

3251
03:28:36,660 --> 03:28:37,560
Oh, nevermind.

3252
03:28:40,300 --> 03:28:41,280
It's the cam.

3253
03:28:41,600 --> 03:28:43,340
Oh gosh, I can't remember this mode.

3254
03:28:43,440 --> 03:28:43,900
Sorry guys.

3255
03:28:43,980 --> 03:28:44,320
Hold on.

3256
03:28:45,100 --> 03:28:48,780
Everybody is telling me a bunch of things at once, so I'm kind of like...

3257
03:28:48,780 --> 03:28:50,320
I'm a little...

3258
03:28:51,100 --> 03:28:53,320
Do I have to bait her or...

3259
03:29:00,050 --> 03:29:00,970
Oh dammit.

3260
03:29:01,770 --> 03:29:02,390
I'm stuck.

3261
03:29:02,750 --> 03:29:03,310
I'm stuck.

3262
03:29:03,590 --> 03:29:04,810
Oh no, she's got me.

3263
03:29:07,890 --> 03:29:08,850
Nice angle.

3264
03:29:13,140 --> 03:29:14,900
Anyway, women.

3265
03:29:16,200 --> 03:29:16,580
Gosh.

3266
03:29:30,620 --> 03:29:31,640
Statue first.

3267
03:29:31,820 --> 03:29:33,300
Oh, where's the statue?

3268
03:29:34,920 --> 03:29:36,640
Wait, no wonder I never got it then.

3269
03:29:38,820 --> 03:29:40,040
Wait, no way!

3270
03:29:41,700 --> 03:29:42,500
No way.

3271
03:29:42,600 --> 03:29:44,160
Wait, I don't get the statue?

3272
03:29:46,780 --> 03:29:47,680
Too late!

3273
03:29:48,620 --> 03:29:50,520
No, no way.

3274
03:29:50,620 --> 03:29:50,980
Seriously?

3275
03:29:50,980 --> 03:29:51,240
Seriously?

3276
03:30:11,400 --> 03:30:13,600
Okay, you guys...

3277
03:30:13,600 --> 03:30:16,800
You can't say we told you when I'm...

3278
03:30:16,800 --> 03:30:19,660
When there's like a bajillion messages at once on screen.

3279
03:30:20,120 --> 03:30:24,840
People were saying the camera, people are saying the statue, people are saying hold it out.

3280
03:30:24,940 --> 03:30:27,440
Like, there's not really a way that I can like...

3281
03:30:28,300 --> 03:30:30,120
See everything at once, okay?

3282
03:30:30,760 --> 03:30:31,280
So...

3283
03:30:32,040 --> 03:30:33,660
That's never a helpful comment.

3284
03:30:33,860 --> 03:30:37,540
And honestly, I think that kind of comment would piss anybody off.

3285
03:30:40,980 --> 03:30:41,460
Oh...

3286
03:30:44,480 --> 03:30:46,240
I don't know what to do.

3287
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:49,100
I don't know what to do.

3288
03:30:58,490 --> 03:31:00,910
I have to restart from my last...

3289
03:31:00,910 --> 03:31:02,710
You guys, I don't know the last time I saved.

3290
03:31:23,340 --> 03:31:25,100
Last save was talking to Naomi.

3291
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:27,060
Oh, you're right.

3292
03:31:27,380 --> 03:31:27,760
Okay.

3293
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:35,220
Yeah, we did save talking to Naomi.

3294
03:31:35,380 --> 03:31:36,720
We'll just have to do the fight again.

3295
03:31:49,490 --> 03:31:53,870
Where is... Does anybody know where the statue is so I can just grab it really easily?

3296
03:31:54,910 --> 03:31:55,890
Oh, that's so annoying.

3297
03:31:56,710 --> 03:31:57,730
Oh, that's so annoying.

3298
03:32:01,700 --> 03:32:02,580
I'm so...

3299
03:32:07,050 --> 03:32:10,510
Why is it also... Why can't I get it afterwards either?

3300
03:32:12,650 --> 03:32:14,170
Why can't I get it?

3301
03:32:16,090 --> 03:32:18,630
Why can't I get it after the... Oh, that's why.

3302
03:32:20,910 --> 03:32:21,810
That's why.

3303
03:32:30,650 --> 03:32:31,690
On the bed.

3304
03:32:31,830 --> 03:32:32,090
Okay.

3305
03:32:32,690 --> 03:32:33,470
On the bed.

3306
03:32:33,790 --> 03:32:34,330
Got it.

3307
03:32:38,430 --> 03:32:45,230
For those who don't realize what the statue is, basically, if you defeat the enemies non-lethally...

3308
03:32:45,230 --> 03:32:49,090
Also, she had, like, half health, so that's why I thought I was fine.

3309
03:32:50,490 --> 03:32:52,970
She was at, like, half Trank health.

3310
03:32:53,650 --> 03:33:01,810
If you defeat the boss babes non-lethally, you can collect a statue of theirs.

3311
03:33:01,810 --> 03:33:03,810
And the statue...

3312
03:33:05,050 --> 03:33:09,210
If you collect all of them, you get to unlock a special weapon, and I want that weapon.

3313
03:33:09,530 --> 03:33:12,550
So, Micmac, thank you for the 10 gift, and thank you.

3314
03:33:13,190 --> 03:33:15,110
Alright, let's do this all over again.

3315
03:33:15,170 --> 03:33:16,030
I'm sorry, guys.

3316
03:33:16,370 --> 03:33:16,970
I'm sorry.

3317
03:33:20,330 --> 03:33:21,370
Gosh dang it.

3318
03:33:21,750 --> 03:33:22,610
I'm so frustrated.

3319
03:33:24,350 --> 03:33:29,370
You guys were saying the statue, I just didn't realize I was going to kill her so fast.

3320
03:33:31,030 --> 03:33:32,670
That's my fault, I guess.

3321
03:33:32,730 --> 03:33:35,330
I didn't realize I would get her so easily.

3322
03:33:36,130 --> 03:33:37,390
I'm just a gamer, I guess.

3323
03:33:42,670 --> 03:33:44,290
Please let me change weapons.

3324
03:33:56,470 --> 03:33:57,470
Where are they?

3325
03:33:57,610 --> 03:33:58,310
Are they coming this way?

3326
03:33:59,370 --> 03:34:00,090
Oh, there they are.

3327
03:34:00,190 --> 03:34:00,590
Yeah, yeah.

3328
03:34:06,850 --> 03:34:08,730
Oh, you didn't even notice.

3329
03:34:12,010 --> 03:34:15,870
And then we remember, they don't drop very good loot, but that's okay.

3330
03:34:22,350 --> 03:34:23,090
This side?

3331
03:34:23,690 --> 03:34:25,610
I think they come... Never mind.

3332
03:34:25,850 --> 03:34:26,570
They come through over here.

3333
03:34:27,850 --> 03:34:28,590
Oh, shoot.

3334
03:34:32,250 --> 03:34:32,690
Man!

3335
03:34:32,690 --> 03:34:32,730
Man!

3336
03:34:35,530 --> 03:34:37,470
What does... What do you mean by that?

3337
03:34:38,770 --> 03:34:39,290
Man!

3338
03:34:40,550 --> 03:34:41,030
Hello?

3339
03:34:42,070 --> 03:34:42,570
Hello?

3340
03:34:43,530 --> 03:34:44,070
Can you come back?

3341
03:34:45,110 --> 03:34:45,590
Oh, shoot.

3342
03:34:46,970 --> 03:34:47,890
Gosh, lady.

3343
03:34:48,510 --> 03:34:49,410
You scared the heck out of me.

3344
03:34:51,310 --> 03:34:51,830
Take.

3345
03:34:52,290 --> 03:34:52,610
Take.

3346
03:34:55,290 --> 03:34:55,810
Okay.

3347
03:34:58,470 --> 03:34:59,730
These guys are in here.

3348
03:35:00,870 --> 03:35:01,450
Pretty sure.

3349
03:35:04,150 --> 03:35:05,110
Oh, woah, woah, woah.

3350
03:35:06,410 --> 03:35:08,470
Oh, there's V-Ring ammo right there.

3351
03:35:08,510 --> 03:35:09,110
You see that?

3352
03:35:10,030 --> 03:35:11,690
I wonder if that will work for me.

3353
03:35:15,710 --> 03:35:16,150
Hello?

3354
03:35:18,610 --> 03:35:19,050
Hello?

3355
03:35:19,050 --> 03:35:19,490
Froggies?

3356
03:35:21,330 --> 03:35:21,770
Frog?

3357
03:35:22,490 --> 03:35:22,810
Frog?

3358
03:35:23,690 --> 03:35:24,670
Oh, I missed him.

3359
03:35:25,090 --> 03:35:25,730
Oh, I missed him.

3360
03:35:26,770 --> 03:35:27,610
I missed him.

3361
03:35:29,530 --> 03:35:29,970
Frog?

3362
03:35:30,710 --> 03:35:31,310
Oh, shoot.

3363
03:35:31,550 --> 03:35:33,270
I need to be a little more aggressive, maybe.

3364
03:35:33,270 --> 03:35:34,170
Oh.

3365
03:35:34,410 --> 03:35:34,850
Oh, frog.

3366
03:35:39,030 --> 03:35:40,390
Can you come out?

3367
03:35:50,830 --> 03:35:52,530
I'm like super chill right now.

3368
03:35:53,690 --> 03:35:54,770
Oh, my gosh.

3369
03:35:56,570 --> 03:35:57,690
God, that scared me.

3370
03:35:59,950 --> 03:36:00,330
Hello?

3371
03:36:09,110 --> 03:36:10,010
We're chill.

3372
03:36:10,770 --> 03:36:11,450
We're chill.

3373
03:36:11,550 --> 03:36:11,970
We're chill.

3374
03:36:13,050 --> 03:36:14,390
Just realizing the reload.

3375
03:36:16,250 --> 03:36:17,770
I'm almost out of bullets.

3376
03:36:18,170 --> 03:36:19,130
Oh, geez.

3377
03:36:20,550 --> 03:36:22,010
Sorry, I'm being a little passive here.

3378
03:36:22,370 --> 03:36:24,150
I'm still... I'm still salty.

3379
03:36:28,430 --> 03:36:29,670
I'm still salty.

3380
03:36:33,390 --> 03:36:34,410
Where'd she go?

3381
03:36:46,040 --> 03:36:46,820
Oh, my God.

3382
03:36:47,140 --> 03:36:47,600
There we go.

3383
03:36:53,170 --> 03:36:55,930
At least the...

3384
03:36:58,210 --> 03:37:00,450
At least the... What's it called?

3385
03:37:00,530 --> 03:37:01,570
The octopus fight.

3386
03:37:01,670 --> 03:37:02,870
It's not bad.

3387
03:37:02,910 --> 03:37:03,850
It's just, you know...

3388
03:37:04,330 --> 03:37:06,030
Sometimes it's hard to find...

3389
03:37:06,030 --> 03:37:06,850
Why?

3390
03:37:16,510 --> 03:37:17,690
Yeah, maybe come in here.

3391
03:37:18,170 --> 03:37:19,610
Yeah, let's check it out.

3392
03:37:20,690 --> 03:37:21,670
Yeah, come on in here.

3393
03:37:22,630 --> 03:37:23,430
Or do nothing.

3394
03:37:23,850 --> 03:37:24,490
Okay, here they go.

3395
03:37:25,990 --> 03:37:26,430
Oh, shoot.

3396
03:37:27,970 --> 03:37:29,090
I'm almost out of ammo.

3397
03:37:29,610 --> 03:37:30,690
Let me buy some more.

3398
03:37:36,980 --> 03:37:37,420
Wait.

3399
03:37:48,020 --> 03:37:48,460
Operator.

3400
03:37:48,500 --> 03:37:49,500
Oh, this is a suppressor.

3401
03:37:49,560 --> 03:37:50,040
I'm stupid.

3402
03:37:50,240 --> 03:37:51,440
I was like...

3403
03:37:51,440 --> 03:37:54,640
They were... They're all blind, so I...

3404
03:37:55,740 --> 03:37:57,160
I was like, wait a second.

3405
03:37:59,640 --> 03:38:00,080
These...

3406
03:38:02,280 --> 03:38:02,720
Are...

3407
03:38:02,720 --> 03:38:04,240
These are shaped.

3408
03:38:06,100 --> 03:38:06,980
Did I buy it?

3409
03:38:10,420 --> 03:38:11,100
There we go.

3410
03:38:11,220 --> 03:38:11,360
Okay.

3411
03:38:14,900 --> 03:38:15,620
Ma'am.

3412
03:38:16,120 --> 03:38:17,200
Oh, they're both still here.

3413
03:38:17,320 --> 03:38:17,560
My bad.

3414
03:38:17,560 --> 03:38:18,980
Oh, my gosh.

3415
03:38:21,540 --> 03:38:22,180
Nice.

3416
03:38:24,420 --> 03:38:25,060
And...

3417
03:38:25,060 --> 03:38:25,740
Where's the other one?

3418
03:38:27,440 --> 03:38:28,460
Where are you?

3419
03:38:28,780 --> 03:38:29,480
Where's the other one?

3420
03:38:30,620 --> 03:38:31,260
Lady?

3421
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:34,780
Oh, oh.

3422
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:36,360
No, I got you!

3423
03:38:36,580 --> 03:38:36,920
Please!

3424
03:38:37,540 --> 03:38:38,140
Thank you.

3425
03:38:38,520 --> 03:38:39,280
Oh, gosh.

3426
03:38:47,850 --> 03:38:48,490
CP.

3427
03:38:53,580 --> 03:38:54,260
Is that it?

3428
03:38:54,260 --> 03:38:55,600
Is that all of them?

3429
03:38:57,760 --> 03:38:58,820
Is it time for snake?

3430
03:38:59,940 --> 03:39:00,660
I mean octopus.

3431
03:39:01,720 --> 03:39:02,500
Octopus time.

3432
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:05,740
I think I have to go into the hallway.

3433
03:39:07,480 --> 03:39:08,640
Alright, let's get my gun.

3434
03:39:08,700 --> 03:39:09,820
Let's change my gun.

3435
03:39:11,620 --> 03:39:13,320
No more real gun.

3436
03:39:14,140 --> 03:39:14,860
We do.

3437
03:39:15,980 --> 03:39:16,720
Oh, what was it?

3438
03:39:19,900 --> 03:39:21,320
Wasn't it an other fighter?

3439
03:39:21,660 --> 03:39:21,840
No.

3440
03:39:22,480 --> 03:39:22,880
Rifle.

3441
03:39:24,260 --> 03:39:24,400
No.

3442
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:25,320
No.

3443
03:39:26,060 --> 03:39:26,660
Where is it?

3444
03:39:28,980 --> 03:39:29,820
Oh, there it is.

3445
03:39:30,320 --> 03:39:30,800
Sorry.

3446
03:39:32,780 --> 03:39:35,200
Can you dance with the sad laughing octopus?

3447
03:39:35,800 --> 03:39:36,860
I will try.

3448
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:38,820
I think I have to hold out a little bit.

3449
03:39:39,500 --> 03:39:40,260
I have to like...

3450
03:39:44,660 --> 03:39:45,140
Okay.

3451
03:39:46,180 --> 03:39:48,100
There is an X over there.

3452
03:39:49,620 --> 03:39:50,120
Snake!

3453
03:39:52,920 --> 03:39:54,340
Here she comes!

3454
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:57,220
And we will skip the cutscene.

3455
03:40:04,860 --> 03:40:05,360
Snake!

3456
03:40:08,700 --> 03:40:09,380
And run!

3457
03:40:10,320 --> 03:40:10,860
Oh, shoot.

3458
03:40:18,770 --> 03:40:19,330
Oh, no.

3459
03:40:19,650 --> 03:40:19,870
Wait!

3460
03:40:20,230 --> 03:40:20,890
I need a bed!

3461
03:40:24,810 --> 03:40:25,690
Oh, never mind.

3462
03:40:26,190 --> 03:40:26,810
Oh, it's these guys.

3463
03:40:26,810 --> 03:40:28,530
I thought she was curling into a ball.

3464
03:40:30,490 --> 03:40:32,090
Where are you?

3465
03:40:32,950 --> 03:40:34,010
Are you in the ceilings?

3466
03:40:35,010 --> 03:40:36,030
Where are you?

3467
03:40:44,450 --> 03:40:45,230
Like that.

3468
03:40:53,770 --> 03:40:54,630
And she's gone.

3469
03:40:56,770 --> 03:40:57,750
And she's back.

3470
03:40:58,750 --> 03:40:59,730
And she's away.

3471
03:41:02,710 --> 03:41:03,410
Dang it.

3472
03:41:03,450 --> 03:41:06,310
I wanted a headshot there, but I didn't have a chance to.

3473
03:41:08,090 --> 03:41:08,610
Nice.

3474
03:41:09,910 --> 03:41:10,430
Okay.

3475
03:41:11,010 --> 03:41:11,850
And what about...

3476
03:41:11,850 --> 03:41:12,210
Yep.

3477
03:41:12,530 --> 03:41:14,210
Oh, never mind.

3478
03:41:14,530 --> 03:41:16,770
I think...

3479
03:41:16,770 --> 03:41:17,190
Oh, no.

3480
03:41:18,130 --> 03:41:20,610
I think her rolling around is next phase.

3481
03:41:22,270 --> 03:41:22,950
Ma'am!

3482
03:41:23,410 --> 03:41:25,070
Oh, I think I hear her.

3483
03:41:26,650 --> 03:41:27,710
Or is that those?

3484
03:41:33,610 --> 03:41:35,490
Are you in the ceiling?

3485
03:41:36,630 --> 03:41:38,590
I love hide and seek time.

3486
03:41:39,410 --> 03:41:40,850
It's kinda chill, actually.

3487
03:42:01,250 --> 03:42:04,330
Just you try and find me.

3488
03:42:05,330 --> 03:42:06,470
It's falling!

3489
03:42:07,030 --> 03:42:07,250
Wait.

3490
03:42:08,250 --> 03:42:08,970
It's falling!

3491
03:42:20,150 --> 03:42:21,310
Oh, gosh.

3492
03:42:21,390 --> 03:42:22,070
I can't see anything.

3493
03:42:22,410 --> 03:42:22,770
Oh, gosh.

3494
03:42:22,790 --> 03:42:23,390
I'm actually stuck.

3495
03:42:24,930 --> 03:42:25,310
Okay.

3496
03:42:25,470 --> 03:42:25,790
We're good.

3497
03:42:25,850 --> 03:42:26,130
We're good.

3498
03:42:26,230 --> 03:42:26,470
We're good.

3499
03:42:26,770 --> 03:42:27,110
We're chill.

3500
03:42:27,270 --> 03:42:27,550
We're chill.

3501
03:42:27,930 --> 03:42:28,530
Everything's fine.

3502
03:42:29,590 --> 03:42:30,630
Sometimes she's bawling.

3503
03:42:30,750 --> 03:42:31,950
Sometimes she's not bawling.

3504
03:42:32,630 --> 03:42:33,130
Oh, ration?

3505
03:42:33,250 --> 03:42:33,590
Thank you.

3506
03:42:33,650 --> 03:42:33,850
Yeah.

3507
03:42:34,030 --> 03:42:34,710
Let's use a ration.

3508
03:42:36,830 --> 03:42:37,150
Thank you.

3509
03:42:37,150 --> 03:42:37,390
Thank you.

3510
03:42:42,540 --> 03:42:43,560
Where are you?

3511
03:42:44,400 --> 03:42:45,120
Where are you?

3512
03:42:45,120 --> 03:42:46,440
Night vision.

3513
03:42:46,560 --> 03:42:47,720
Everybody, close your eyes!

3514
03:42:49,140 --> 03:42:51,460
She is... that?

3515
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:52,760
This is not her.

3516
03:42:57,900 --> 03:42:58,880
What?

3517
03:42:59,840 --> 03:43:00,460
What?

3518
03:43:01,080 --> 03:43:01,680
This?

3519
03:43:02,560 --> 03:43:02,900
What?

3520
03:43:08,570 --> 03:43:10,110
The box?

3521
03:43:10,870 --> 03:43:11,830
What box?

3522
03:43:13,430 --> 03:43:14,610
Or this?

3523
03:43:15,350 --> 03:43:15,610
No.

3524
03:43:15,970 --> 03:43:16,710
The box?

3525
03:43:18,890 --> 03:43:19,850
Oh, shoot the box.

3526
03:43:19,910 --> 03:43:20,350
This part.

3527
03:43:23,850 --> 03:43:24,990
That's kind of funky.

3528
03:43:34,810 --> 03:43:35,830
Finding her again.

3529
03:43:37,610 --> 03:43:38,770
Sorry for your eyes.

3530
03:43:39,550 --> 03:43:40,150
Sorry for your...

3531
03:43:46,610 --> 03:43:47,870
This part is neat.

3532
03:43:48,050 --> 03:43:49,190
I do enjoy this part.

3533
03:43:49,590 --> 03:43:50,250
I'm not gonna lie.

3534
03:43:51,050 --> 03:43:53,030
It's fun to see what she...

3535
03:43:53,930 --> 03:43:54,450
She's bawling!

3536
03:43:56,750 --> 03:43:57,490
Oh no!

3537
03:43:57,710 --> 03:43:58,230
I missed!

3538
03:43:59,090 --> 03:44:00,190
I'm eating bullets.

3539
03:44:00,390 --> 03:44:02,090
Oh gosh, that was not good.

3540
03:44:09,290 --> 03:44:10,670
This stinking... again.

3541
03:44:17,150 --> 03:44:18,050
Where are you?

3542
03:44:18,530 --> 03:44:19,170
Where are you?

3543
03:44:20,050 --> 03:44:21,030
Not a con.

3544
03:44:21,470 --> 03:44:22,010
Oh, there...

3545
03:44:23,150 --> 03:44:23,850
Dang it.

3546
03:44:24,790 --> 03:44:25,870
This way, snake.

3547
03:44:27,750 --> 03:44:28,410
What?

3548
03:44:28,970 --> 03:44:29,630
What?

3549
03:44:31,310 --> 03:44:33,330
You're not some dummy dum-dum?

3550
03:44:33,670 --> 03:44:34,290
Oh man!

3551
03:44:42,410 --> 03:44:43,470
Wait, what?

3552
03:44:44,050 --> 03:44:44,730
What just happened?

3553
03:44:47,640 --> 03:44:48,250
Just kidding.

3554
03:44:48,830 --> 03:44:51,790
Where is

3555
03:44:57,280 --> 03:44:57,460
she?

3556
03:44:58,280 --> 03:45:00,040
Alright, sorry for your eyes again.

3557
03:45:04,290 --> 03:45:05,770
Is this her?

3558
03:45:06,410 --> 03:45:06,670
Yep.

3559
03:45:07,630 --> 03:45:08,770
Oh, come on.

3560
03:45:09,330 --> 03:45:09,790
Really?

3561
03:45:16,890 --> 03:45:17,890
Night vision.

3562
03:45:18,770 --> 03:45:19,950
Where is she at?

3563
03:45:25,610 --> 03:45:27,110
Me first!

3564
03:45:38,410 --> 03:45:40,870
I've always wanted to do that!

3565
03:45:41,570 --> 03:45:42,570
You

3566
03:45:46,240 --> 03:45:49,460
think I wouldn't think twice?

3567
03:45:50,460 --> 03:45:51,420
Ouch, ouch.

3568
03:45:51,520 --> 03:45:51,840
Oh god.

3569
03:46:00,060 --> 03:46:02,460
Sorry guys.

3570
03:46:04,000 --> 03:46:05,380
Sorry guys.

3571
03:46:05,560 --> 03:46:06,220
Shoot.

3572
03:46:07,120 --> 03:46:08,640
I should have rationed.

3573
03:46:14,460 --> 03:46:15,960
I should have rationed.

3574
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:18,760
We were so close too.

3575
03:46:19,760 --> 03:46:21,000
We were so close too.

3576
03:46:33,920 --> 03:46:35,220
Sorry, I just wanted to check.

3577
03:46:39,120 --> 03:46:41,400
Gamer conservation moment, truly.

3578
03:46:42,600 --> 03:46:43,300
I messed up.

3579
03:46:43,820 --> 03:46:45,080
I take the blame.

3580
03:46:47,200 --> 03:46:48,120
Ma'am, where are you?

3581
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,180
Oh gosh, I didn't even see it!

3582
03:46:51,880 --> 03:46:53,480
At least it didn't do so much damage.

3583
03:47:00,750 --> 03:47:02,210
Octolady, where are you?

3584
03:47:21,230 --> 03:47:22,490
Did that hit?

3585
03:47:22,590 --> 03:47:24,610
I think it did, but not very much.

3586
03:47:24,790 --> 03:47:25,610
It could have been better.

3587
03:47:26,290 --> 03:47:27,190
It could have been so much better.

3588
03:47:42,680 --> 03:47:43,720
She's so frustrating.

3589
03:47:48,280 --> 03:47:49,240
Nice save.

3590
03:47:50,760 --> 03:47:51,760
Wait, is this...

3591
03:47:52,580 --> 03:47:53,760
No, she's...

3592
03:47:53,760 --> 03:47:55,820
She's balling out, but...

3593
03:47:58,320 --> 03:48:01,360
Your hatred of Naomi is irrational.

3594
03:48:01,700 --> 03:48:03,200
Why are you guys plus twoing that?

3595
03:48:05,560 --> 03:48:05,940
Never!

3596
03:48:06,200 --> 03:48:06,540
What?

3597
03:48:07,100 --> 03:48:08,320
Plus two where?

3598
03:48:10,820 --> 03:48:12,680
Plus two where?

3599
03:48:12,940 --> 03:48:13,500
Yeah?

3600
03:48:20,960 --> 03:48:22,440
That's my name!

3601
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:24,280
Don't wear it out!

3602
03:48:27,760 --> 03:48:28,400
But...

3603
03:48:28,400 --> 03:48:29,320
Oh, just kidding.

3604
03:48:29,780 --> 03:48:31,980
Why did it say laughing octopus then?

3605
03:48:33,000 --> 03:48:33,860
Am I crazy?

3606
03:48:42,070 --> 03:48:43,350
Is this actually her?

3607
03:48:46,590 --> 03:48:47,710
I'm confused.

3608
03:48:52,890 --> 03:48:54,170
Where the hell is she?

3609
03:48:54,630 --> 03:48:55,430
Up in the rafter?

3610
03:48:55,430 --> 03:48:55,810
Oh!

3611
03:49:02,450 --> 03:49:03,390
Gamers never look up.

3612
03:49:03,950 --> 03:49:04,530
Oh my gosh.

3613
03:49:04,910 --> 03:49:06,030
Why did it say that's her then?

3614
03:49:06,230 --> 03:49:06,910
Poor woman.

3615
03:49:07,450 --> 03:49:09,110
She's just really asleep, you know?

3616
03:49:10,730 --> 03:49:11,370
Oh my god.

3617
03:49:17,830 --> 03:49:18,990
I can't get her...

3618
03:49:18,990 --> 03:49:21,290
I can't get over her like slithering through.

3619
03:49:23,710 --> 03:49:24,570
It's so funny.

3620
03:49:29,370 --> 03:49:29,770
No!

3621
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:35,800
I wonder how speedrunners do this one.

3622
03:49:37,780 --> 03:49:38,640
Oh, no!

3623
03:49:38,820 --> 03:49:40,220
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

3624
03:49:40,420 --> 03:49:43,620
I was preemptively getting ready for the...

3625
03:49:45,200 --> 03:49:46,380
for the ball.

3626
03:49:48,100 --> 03:49:49,900
I'm not doing so hot this round.

3627
03:49:55,630 --> 03:49:56,490
This way?

3628
03:49:59,790 --> 03:50:00,350
Okay.

3629
03:50:00,630 --> 03:50:01,130
Night vision!

3630
03:50:01,750 --> 03:50:01,950
Go!

3631
03:50:03,110 --> 03:50:04,110
Oh, there she is.

3632
03:50:04,130 --> 03:50:05,010
She's the box again.

3633
03:50:06,230 --> 03:50:06,830
We got her.

3634
03:50:11,350 --> 03:50:12,670
Tempting, man.

3635
03:50:22,490 --> 03:50:24,390
And then she's gonna crash through, right?

3636
03:50:24,550 --> 03:50:25,990
She's crashing out, literally.

3637
03:50:30,960 --> 03:50:32,540
Actually, I don't know where she is.

3638
03:50:38,960 --> 03:50:39,600
Sorry.

3639
03:50:39,980 --> 03:50:40,860
So funny.

3640
03:50:42,040 --> 03:50:43,200
I'm right there.

3641
03:50:43,500 --> 03:50:45,060
I'm right here.

3642
03:50:45,700 --> 03:50:46,780
Oh, reload.

3643
03:50:49,920 --> 03:50:50,860
Oh, shoot.

3644
03:50:55,480 --> 03:50:57,380
I missed my chance.

3645
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:21,140
Now,

3646
03:51:26,180 --> 03:51:26,740
where is she?

3647
03:51:28,320 --> 03:51:29,740
Now, where could she be?

3648
03:51:30,940 --> 03:51:32,000
Where is she at?

3649
03:51:32,600 --> 03:51:32,940
Night vision!

3650
03:51:33,560 --> 03:51:33,580
Run!

3651
03:51:34,600 --> 03:51:36,220
No, no, no.

3652
03:51:38,680 --> 03:51:39,160
Ew.

3653
03:51:40,480 --> 03:51:41,400
Oh, my gosh.

3654
03:51:42,000 --> 03:51:42,580
Zoom in.

3655
03:51:48,380 --> 03:51:48,860
What?

3656
03:51:53,040 --> 03:51:54,000
Call Otacon?

3657
03:51:54,600 --> 03:51:55,280
Oh, sorry.

3658
03:51:55,380 --> 03:51:55,820
I missed it.

3659
03:51:58,480 --> 03:51:59,460
Let's see what he says.

3660
03:51:59,900 --> 03:52:00,800
I'll call him.

3661
03:52:00,880 --> 03:52:01,520
I'll call him.

3662
03:52:05,180 --> 03:52:09,340
Snake, Octopus's suit seems to work the same way as your Octocamel.

3663
03:52:09,700 --> 03:52:12,480
It'll use mimicry and traps as weapons against you.

3664
03:52:12,980 --> 03:52:13,800
Stay focused.

3665
03:52:14,240 --> 03:52:16,380
Don't be deceived by its disguises.

3666
03:52:16,420 --> 03:52:17,560
I'm deceived.

3667
03:52:21,420 --> 03:52:22,060
Shoot.

3668
03:52:29,350 --> 03:52:30,150
Oh, wait.

3669
03:52:31,410 --> 03:52:32,510
She gassed.

3670
03:52:33,030 --> 03:52:33,770
Oh, no, no, no.

3671
03:52:33,770 --> 03:52:36,190
She went gassed.

3672
03:52:36,550 --> 03:52:37,650
I thought she was rolling.

3673
03:52:38,390 --> 03:52:39,290
Instead, she's gassing.

3674
03:52:39,830 --> 03:52:43,130
Is that you?

3675
03:52:46,130 --> 03:52:46,970
Finally!

3676
03:53:06,580 --> 03:53:07,420
Naomi!

3677
03:53:08,280 --> 03:53:09,760
Does he say anything here?

3678
03:53:11,300 --> 03:53:11,980
Naomi!

3679
03:53:21,360 --> 03:53:21,840
Naomi!

3680
03:53:24,040 --> 03:53:26,260
I've always wanted to do this.

3681
03:53:31,100 --> 03:53:33,320
There she goes, slithering on by.

3682
03:53:34,080 --> 03:53:36,260
By the way, she moves so awesome.

3683
03:53:50,070 --> 03:53:50,550
Oh,

3684
03:53:57,010 --> 03:53:57,870
you're going to shoot from up there?

3685
03:54:11,970 --> 03:54:14,230
I love the way she's like, no.

3686
03:54:15,030 --> 03:54:16,350
Just slithers on.

3687
03:54:20,790 --> 03:54:22,990
Yeah, that's what I thought, lady.

3688
03:54:24,910 --> 03:54:26,030
Bye-bye.

3689
03:54:28,610 --> 03:54:29,330
Damn it.

3690
03:54:34,930 --> 03:54:36,550
I'm not going to...

3691
03:54:37,590 --> 03:54:39,610
Trying to figure out if I want to ration or not.

3692
03:54:46,330 --> 03:54:47,450
Got her.

3693
03:54:48,990 --> 03:54:50,010
OK, we're close.

3694
03:54:59,150 --> 03:54:59,670
Nice.

3695
03:54:59,930 --> 03:55:00,570
One more.

3696
03:55:01,770 --> 03:55:02,530
Slide away.

3697
03:55:18,390 --> 03:55:21,770
Alright, now we statue.

3698
03:55:23,310 --> 03:55:24,570
Just reminding you about the statue.

3699
03:55:24,670 --> 03:55:26,390
Find it before you enter the white void world.

3700
03:55:27,890 --> 03:55:31,530
I'm going to skip this cutscene since we just saw it.

3701
03:55:31,530 --> 03:55:32,030
I'm sorry.

3702
03:55:43,230 --> 03:55:48,270
I got it!

3703
03:56:01,530 --> 03:56:01,930
Yeah!

3704
03:56:05,350 --> 03:56:07,230
Makes a great gift for Sunny.

3705
03:56:08,270 --> 03:56:08,570
OK.

3706
03:56:11,330 --> 03:56:12,290
Where is she?

3707
03:56:13,210 --> 03:56:14,370
She's kind of freaking me out.

3708
03:56:21,830 --> 03:56:24,530
I have to wait until...

3709
03:56:25,710 --> 03:56:27,310
Oh, damn.

3710
03:56:28,610 --> 03:56:29,350
I messed up.

3711
03:56:30,090 --> 03:56:30,610
Damn it.

3712
03:56:30,690 --> 03:56:31,270
I messed up again.

3713
03:56:45,870 --> 03:56:46,690
OK, I'll wait.

3714
03:56:46,790 --> 03:56:47,110
I'll wait.

3715
03:56:47,230 --> 03:56:47,550
I'll wait.

3716
03:56:48,330 --> 03:56:48,710
I'll wait.

3717
03:56:48,830 --> 03:56:49,090
I'll wait.

3718
03:56:49,210 --> 03:56:49,510
I'll wait.

3719
03:56:49,650 --> 03:56:49,890
I'll wait.

3720
03:56:51,790 --> 03:56:54,990
We get all the cool... what's it called?

3721
03:56:57,270 --> 03:56:58,450
I missed anyway.

3722
03:57:03,470 --> 03:57:04,350
She's so fast.

3723
03:57:07,110 --> 03:57:08,150
Oh my goodness.

3724
03:57:10,970 --> 03:57:11,570
Oh!

3725
03:57:13,510 --> 03:57:15,330
How strong are my bullets?

3726
03:57:17,030 --> 03:57:18,090
Sorry guys.

3727
03:57:18,290 --> 03:57:19,450
We'll get them next time.

3728
03:57:20,870 --> 03:57:22,790
How strong are my bullets?

3729
03:57:24,830 --> 03:57:26,530
We'll get the photo shoot next time.

3730
03:57:29,450 --> 03:57:34,590
But like, they're not... sometimes it does little damage, sometimes it does big, big damage.

3731
03:57:37,690 --> 03:57:38,650
Mission failed.

3732
03:57:38,790 --> 03:57:39,990
Truly a mission failed.

3733
03:57:40,110 --> 03:57:40,290
No!

3734
03:57:40,670 --> 03:57:42,310
This is a fish and mailed moment.

3735
03:57:43,570 --> 03:57:44,250
It's OK.

3736
03:57:44,310 --> 03:57:46,110
We got other ladies we can dance with.

3737
03:57:46,850 --> 03:57:50,190
I'm always scared about that part though, because I'm afraid of not making it in time.

3738
03:57:58,880 --> 03:58:01,200
And she becomes a cocoon.

3739
03:58:07,900 --> 03:58:09,680
And she's back to baby.

3740
03:58:12,320 --> 03:58:14,740
Just a little baby in the womb.

3741
03:58:18,720 --> 03:58:20,540
But she's alive, because I did that.

3742
03:58:23,500 --> 03:58:25,380
She's just a sleeping baby.

3743
03:58:26,860 --> 03:58:29,320
These camera shots, I know, they're quite cultured.

3744
03:58:31,680 --> 03:58:34,120
Everybody gets fan service in these games.

3745
03:58:34,200 --> 03:58:34,800
It's amazing.

3746
03:58:40,440 --> 03:58:41,520
The Octo.

3747
03:58:45,550 --> 03:58:47,170
We can become Deadpool.

3748
03:58:55,310 --> 03:58:57,270
The eepy baby unit.

3749
03:58:57,590 --> 03:58:58,330
It's true.

3750
03:59:03,630 --> 03:59:06,050
The baby is still afoot.

3751
03:59:06,050 --> 03:59:06,070
What?

3752
03:59:13,370 --> 03:59:16,530
OK, Drebin is going to lure a drop real quick, but I really need water.

3753
03:59:16,670 --> 03:59:20,750
So I'm going to go grab some water super duper fast while he explains the lure.

3754
03:59:20,870 --> 03:59:24,450
But I'm not going to miss all of it, because he just talks forever.

3755
03:59:24,950 --> 03:59:26,010
I'm going to run.

3756
03:59:27,230 --> 03:59:27,590
BRB

3757
03:59:39,050 --> 03:59:40,770
It's not my size or shape.

3758
03:59:41,310 --> 03:59:45,290
Yeah, looks like you could use a bit of tailoring before you can sport it.

3759
03:59:45,890 --> 03:59:48,050
Not my line of work, but...

3760
03:59:48,670 --> 03:59:51,070
Ain't you got a buddy who specializes in that kind of thing?

3761
03:59:54,030 --> 03:59:55,410
Somebody's done their homework.

3762
03:59:55,930 --> 03:59:57,950
Hey, here's my job.

3763
03:59:59,230 --> 04:00:02,410
Is that the real reason you injected me with those nanomachines?

3764
04:00:02,750 --> 04:00:03,910
To spy on me?

3765
04:00:03,910 --> 04:00:08,810
I prefer the term customer data management myself.

3766
04:00:09,050 --> 04:00:09,610
Drebin!

3767
04:00:10,010 --> 04:00:12,470
Relax, it's strictly confidential.

3768
04:00:13,230 --> 04:00:14,870
I ain't gonna share it with anybody.

3769
04:00:15,350 --> 04:00:18,130
Then what did you mix a virus in with the nanomachines for?

3770
04:00:18,670 --> 04:00:19,150
Virus?

3771
04:00:19,870 --> 04:00:22,530
A certain virus was detected in my body.

3772
04:00:23,170 --> 04:00:25,850
Are you saying it wasn't in the nanomachines you injected?

3773
04:00:26,530 --> 04:00:30,570
Look, you do know there are other folks who could have done this to you.

3774
04:00:30,570 --> 04:00:34,810
And besides, what would I gain from infecting you?

3775
04:00:35,690 --> 04:00:38,550
Better for me that you're out there kicking ass on the battlefield.

3776
04:00:38,630 --> 04:00:39,470
Did he start the lore?

3777
04:00:39,930 --> 04:00:41,210
I was watching you, Snake.

3778
04:00:41,690 --> 04:00:43,410
You're a real piece of work.

3779
04:00:44,130 --> 04:00:46,430
Never thought I'd meet the man who could take down...

3780
04:00:46,430 --> 04:00:48,050
He hasn't even started it?

3781
04:00:49,990 --> 04:00:51,910
She just kept on laughing.

3782
04:00:52,230 --> 04:00:52,810
Oh here it is.

3783
04:00:52,830 --> 04:00:54,170
And what do you suppose that is?

3784
04:00:55,890 --> 04:00:57,130
Something to blast.

3785
04:00:57,650 --> 04:00:58,550
You got it.

3786
04:00:58,550 --> 04:01:01,030
Oh I made it back for the lore.

3787
04:01:03,850 --> 04:01:07,190
I even took medicine for my throat.

3788
04:01:18,190 --> 04:01:20,190
Perfect timing, truly.

3789
04:01:21,210 --> 04:01:21,970
Such a yapper.

3790
04:01:24,310 --> 04:01:25,950
Jarbin waited for me, honestly.

3791
04:01:26,330 --> 04:01:27,750
Welcome back from the BRB unit.

3792
04:01:30,230 --> 04:01:30,890
That's good.

3793
04:01:34,010 --> 04:01:34,670
Sleepy fish.

3794
04:01:36,010 --> 04:01:37,390
Her eepy baby fishing town.

3795
04:01:38,230 --> 04:01:39,630
Oh wait, that sounds kind of bad.

3796
04:01:41,770 --> 04:01:43,990
They were not fishing for babies.

3797
04:01:47,210 --> 04:01:48,710
Darkwing Dumb, thanks for the 10 gifts.

3798
04:01:52,410 --> 04:01:53,170
Aww.

3799
04:02:05,750 --> 04:02:08,850
These stories are always like...

3800
04:02:08,850 --> 04:02:11,390
What's the worst thing that could happen to a person?

3801
04:02:12,530 --> 04:02:14,510
That's what happened, times 10.

3802
04:02:21,970 --> 04:02:22,010
Aww.

3803
04:02:44,010 --> 04:02:47,390
Just some context.

3804
04:02:52,410 --> 04:02:52,770
Right?

3805
04:03:06,230 --> 04:03:07,730
Thank you for the hakusupa.

3806
04:03:08,590 --> 04:03:11,870
I knew you'd be the only one who knew how to celebrate the year of the snake in style.

3807
04:03:12,010 --> 04:03:13,110
You're pretty good here.

3808
04:03:13,850 --> 04:03:14,570
Thank you!

3809
04:03:16,110 --> 04:03:18,530
Thank you for the hakusupa, mustache man!

3810
04:03:18,530 --> 04:03:23,650
Thank you so much.

3811
04:03:28,870 --> 04:03:30,950
Okay, now we continue.

3812
04:03:31,410 --> 04:03:32,330
At least I got the statue.

3813
04:03:32,910 --> 04:03:33,970
I promise, I promise.

3814
04:03:34,130 --> 04:03:37,130
For the other babes, we'll dance with them.

3815
04:03:37,550 --> 04:03:38,130
We'll have them.

3816
04:03:38,850 --> 04:03:40,150
I do have the camera.

3817
04:03:41,270 --> 04:03:42,610
Oh no.

3818
04:03:44,150 --> 04:03:44,830
Snake.

3819
04:03:46,950 --> 04:03:47,630
Snake.

3820
04:03:47,630 --> 04:03:47,870
Snake?

3821
04:04:05,400 --> 04:04:07,120
This guy worries me.

3822
04:04:08,620 --> 04:04:11,020
Snake, you make me worry too much, buddy.

3823
04:04:12,140 --> 04:04:12,880
Oh no.

3824
04:04:13,240 --> 04:04:13,740
Wait, no.

3825
04:04:15,880 --> 04:04:19,220
Is this where we have to use the vision?

3826
04:04:20,760 --> 04:04:22,840
To follow the footsteps?

3827
04:04:24,140 --> 04:04:25,100
Oh no.

3828
04:04:28,900 --> 04:04:30,420
Oh no!

3829
04:04:30,800 --> 04:04:31,840
Oh no!

3830
04:04:36,450 --> 04:04:36,930
Oh!

3831
04:04:42,880 --> 04:04:44,640
He's checking the size of her feet.

3832
04:04:45,060 --> 04:04:46,000
What a freak.

3833
04:04:53,590 --> 04:04:54,430
Nice feet.

3834
04:04:55,150 --> 04:04:56,710
Okay, she's got them pointy heels.

3835
04:04:56,850 --> 04:04:58,910
But then, I remember she changes her socks.

3836
04:05:01,850 --> 04:05:06,130
I was thinking, I was misremembering this part in Act 3.

3837
04:05:06,610 --> 04:05:09,410
I was like, at least I don't have to do the tracking part today.

3838
04:05:15,370 --> 04:05:15,850
Ugh.

3839
04:05:23,370 --> 04:05:26,350
What do you mean by that?

3840
04:05:33,490 --> 04:05:35,690
What do you mean by that with Big Boss?

3841
04:05:43,870 --> 04:05:47,810
You are so stupid, Rylan.

3842
04:06:00,470 --> 04:06:01,870
Awareness.

3843
04:06:16,310 --> 04:06:17,430
Okay.

3844
04:06:18,490 --> 04:06:20,730
I'm looking for the bent grass.

3845
04:06:24,790 --> 04:06:28,030
Oh, I need the 4D PS3.

3846
04:06:30,810 --> 04:06:31,270
What?

3847
04:06:35,070 --> 04:06:37,010
That one bird that's just like...

3848
04:06:37,010 --> 04:06:37,690
Help!

3849
04:06:39,730 --> 04:06:43,110
You learned ninja techniques in Alaska?

3850
04:06:47,610 --> 04:06:49,890
You're that ninja.

3851
04:06:53,350 --> 04:06:56,690
I like how he's trying to...

3852
04:06:57,610 --> 04:07:03,790
He's backseating the master of stealth.

3853
04:07:04,670 --> 04:07:04,850
Me.

3854
04:07:12,090 --> 04:07:12,530
What?

3855
04:07:15,310 --> 04:07:17,490
It actually makes me so mad.

3856
04:07:17,710 --> 04:07:21,070
That he's just like, by the way Snake, in case you don't know how to sneak.

3857
04:07:21,910 --> 04:07:23,130
Like, shut the hell up.

3858
04:07:24,590 --> 04:07:25,610
It actually makes me mad.

3859
04:07:28,670 --> 04:07:30,110
Especially that it's riding.

3860
04:07:37,690 --> 04:07:39,390
I'll give it a shot.

3861
04:07:42,510 --> 04:07:44,390
And blast that guy.

3862
04:07:47,570 --> 04:07:48,210
Okay.

3863
04:07:56,450 --> 04:07:57,470
Let's see.

3864
04:08:04,740 --> 04:08:06,460
Let's switch out.

3865
04:08:07,340 --> 04:08:09,560
I'm gonna switch this back to the...

3866
04:08:09,560 --> 04:08:11,200
I don't think I'll need it, but just in case.

3867
04:08:13,000 --> 04:08:15,120
So you can be as chuny as Raiden.

3868
04:08:15,880 --> 04:08:18,020
Raiden got a trip on that edge, it's true.

3869
04:08:18,500 --> 04:08:19,380
This guy is so silly.

3870
04:08:20,780 --> 04:08:26,020
Take it easy on Jack, he's just had a Kotori moment and explaining some exciting new thing he just learned.

3871
04:08:28,260 --> 04:08:28,740
Okay.

3872
04:08:30,560 --> 04:08:32,640
Oh Sunny, are you okay?

3873
04:08:34,420 --> 04:08:36,400
My SunnyCam, is she alright?

3874
04:08:39,180 --> 04:08:40,460
Wait, is that the statue?

3875
04:08:42,160 --> 04:08:44,900
Is she hugging the teddy bear?

3876
04:08:45,000 --> 04:08:45,740
I can't tell.

3877
04:08:49,100 --> 04:08:50,540
I can't tell.

3878
04:08:52,540 --> 04:08:53,780
Make her dance.

3879
04:08:54,580 --> 04:08:55,580
We'll make you happy.

3880
04:08:56,860 --> 04:08:58,140
We'll make you happy!

3881
04:09:01,960 --> 04:09:05,020
Wait, does she also dance to this one?

3882
04:09:08,220 --> 04:09:09,920
It's a slower song.

3883
04:09:13,080 --> 04:09:13,600
No...

3884
04:09:16,990 --> 04:09:18,270
It's so sad.

3885
04:09:26,890 --> 04:09:27,410
No...

3886
04:09:27,970 --> 04:09:29,650
Why does it kind of fit the mood?

3887
04:09:32,970 --> 04:09:35,310
Did Mint get the laughing octopus figurine?

3888
04:09:35,370 --> 04:09:35,890
I did!

3889
04:09:36,490 --> 04:09:37,210
I did, I did.

3890
04:09:42,570 --> 04:09:43,090
This...

3891
04:09:43,090 --> 04:09:45,510
The sound of this song reminds me of...

3892
04:09:45,510 --> 04:09:51,110
So one time I was in Akiba, and I was heading to a maid cafe, I think.

3893
04:09:52,690 --> 04:09:55,430
But my reservation wasn't yet.

3894
04:09:56,590 --> 04:09:58,090
And so, there was a...

3895
04:09:59,030 --> 04:10:01,010
There was a street live going on.

3896
04:10:01,630 --> 04:10:04,690
And I went and watched them, and they sounded a lot like this.

3897
04:10:04,770 --> 04:10:07,770
It totally obviously wasn't them, but...

3898
04:10:08,310 --> 04:10:11,070
I still have their CD, they're not active.

3899
04:10:11,070 --> 04:10:19,650
Their theme was so cool, because they were like an old school Japanese princess, and then a demon.

3900
04:10:20,510 --> 04:10:23,610
And their CD, I bought it.

3901
04:10:23,670 --> 04:10:27,330
It was half song and half drama CD.

3902
04:10:28,050 --> 04:10:30,930
And they had their own little world building that they did.

3903
04:10:31,270 --> 04:10:32,330
And it was so cool!

3904
04:10:32,670 --> 04:10:34,470
And they sounded so good!

3905
04:10:34,550 --> 04:10:36,750
I was like, I have to buy a CD, they sound so good.

3906
04:10:40,190 --> 04:10:42,990
Like, their moms were the ones that took my money.

3907
04:10:44,850 --> 04:10:46,430
I still listen to that CD.

3908
04:10:47,450 --> 04:10:50,950
But it's kind of a shame that they couldn't continue their activities.

3909
04:10:53,310 --> 04:10:54,610
Yeah, it was really cool.

3910
04:10:54,990 --> 04:10:56,610
I love finding street lives.

3911
04:11:08,880 --> 04:11:10,180
This is for you, Sunny!

3912
04:11:24,900 --> 04:11:26,760
Okay, follow the footsteps.

3913
04:11:27,440 --> 04:11:29,760
Okay, I actually need to pay attention.

3914
04:11:30,060 --> 04:11:31,520
Sorry, sorry for the music.

3915
04:11:32,980 --> 04:11:33,880
Sorry, music.

3916
04:11:34,220 --> 04:11:34,660
Sorry, Sunny.

3917
04:11:37,340 --> 04:11:42,140
I don't remember when the guys start coming in, so I don't want to get too, you know...

3918
04:11:43,640 --> 04:11:45,700
Too excitable, and then I...

3919
04:11:45,700 --> 04:11:47,500
Okay, so they go this way.

3920
04:11:55,960 --> 04:11:57,580
The trampled grass?

3921
04:11:57,760 --> 04:11:58,800
Is this trampled grass?

3922
04:11:58,920 --> 04:11:59,500
I can't tell.

3923
04:12:13,380 --> 04:12:15,020
Okay, thanks Otacon.

3924
04:12:15,660 --> 04:12:16,220
I will.

3925
04:12:16,580 --> 04:12:18,160
Sorry for your eyes again.

3926
04:12:21,500 --> 04:12:22,800
We are going!

3927
04:12:32,310 --> 04:12:33,590
They look the same.

3928
04:12:33,790 --> 04:12:34,810
This way, right?

3929
04:12:34,910 --> 04:12:36,390
Because it's...

3930
04:12:37,790 --> 04:12:39,750
They wouldn't let her go on her own.

3931
04:12:39,850 --> 04:12:40,790
It's gotta be this way.

3932
04:12:41,730 --> 04:12:42,130
Right?

3933
04:12:43,610 --> 04:12:44,170
Waste.

3934
04:12:48,800 --> 04:12:50,260
The trampled grass.

3935
04:12:55,510 --> 04:12:56,490
Oh my god!

3936
04:12:56,570 --> 04:12:58,330
That guy is peeing over there!

3937
04:13:14,890 --> 04:13:16,210
Where is my camera?

3938
04:13:23,510 --> 04:13:24,070
Wait.

3939
04:13:28,110 --> 04:13:29,190
How do I zoom in?

3940
04:13:37,660 --> 04:13:39,120
How do I zoom in?

3941
04:14:07,940 --> 04:14:10,560
I actually saw him like real pee!

3942
04:14:12,200 --> 04:14:14,300
He was holding his ding dong while he did it.

3943
04:14:14,700 --> 04:14:15,540
Oh my god!

3944
04:14:15,700 --> 04:14:17,580
And he washed his hands!

3945
04:14:25,710 --> 04:14:26,390
What?

3946
04:14:27,710 --> 04:14:28,090
What?

3947
04:14:28,410 --> 04:14:28,630
What?

3948
04:14:29,350 --> 04:14:30,710
No, it's not.

3949
04:14:31,310 --> 04:14:31,810
Sorry.

3950
04:14:32,130 --> 04:14:32,770
Bad aim there.

3951
04:14:33,830 --> 04:14:35,250
I really...

3952
04:14:36,250 --> 04:14:38,910
I really didn't do that one so great.

3953
04:14:39,070 --> 04:14:39,250
Okay.

3954
04:14:39,870 --> 04:14:40,650
Night vision!

3955
04:14:44,130 --> 04:14:45,110
Oh no!

3956
04:14:47,690 --> 04:14:49,130
I can't tell!

3957
04:14:49,430 --> 04:14:51,130
I hate this part!

3958
04:14:51,130 --> 04:14:51,670
Hi!

3959
04:14:53,710 --> 04:14:54,710
It's this way, right?

3960
04:14:55,690 --> 04:14:56,730
Because there is two sets.

3961
04:14:57,570 --> 04:14:57,990
I can't.

3962
04:14:57,990 --> 04:14:58,370
I can't.

3963
04:14:58,430 --> 04:14:59,810
I hate this part so much you guys.

3964
04:14:59,890 --> 04:15:01,290
I'm gonna be messing it up a lot.

3965
04:15:01,330 --> 04:15:01,850
I'm sorry.

3966
04:15:04,870 --> 04:15:05,590
I'm sorry.

3967
04:15:05,730 --> 04:15:06,890
I'm really not good at this part.

3968
04:15:16,520 --> 04:15:17,860
I see bugs and people.

3969
04:15:18,540 --> 04:15:19,300
What is that?

3970
04:15:21,280 --> 04:15:22,260
What's that right there?

3971
04:15:30,680 --> 04:15:33,620
This part is... I know people...

3972
04:15:34,780 --> 04:15:40,620
Some people don't like some scenes that happen further up in...

3973
04:15:41,580 --> 04:15:42,400
Sniff it!

3974
04:15:51,730 --> 04:15:52,650
Nasty!

3975
04:15:53,510 --> 04:15:54,590
It's definitely hers.

3976
04:15:56,950 --> 04:15:58,090
Hold on.

3977
04:16:00,510 --> 04:16:05,190
I know, but this is probably my least favorite part of the game.

3978
04:16:07,350 --> 04:16:08,890
I really don't like this part.

3979
04:16:09,310 --> 04:16:10,750
It's so confusing for me.

3980
04:16:13,550 --> 04:16:15,490
Am I going the right way?

3981
04:16:16,810 --> 04:16:17,930
I hope so.

3982
04:16:21,130 --> 04:16:22,250
Trampled grass!

3983
04:16:24,410 --> 04:16:25,470
Yeah, okay.

3984
04:16:26,050 --> 04:16:27,550
You can backseat here, you guys.

3985
04:16:27,650 --> 04:16:29,310
If I go the wrong way, you can be like, No, Mito!

3986
04:16:30,270 --> 04:16:32,010
Don't go that way!

3987
04:16:32,170 --> 04:16:33,050
And I'll be like, okay.

3988
04:16:34,310 --> 04:16:34,890
Thank you.

3989
04:16:37,310 --> 04:16:41,830
In fact, if you backseat here, I would really love it.

3990
04:16:45,630 --> 04:16:48,010
Are those guys or am I crazy?

3991
04:16:50,730 --> 04:16:51,590
I'm crazy.

3992
04:16:56,090 --> 04:16:58,530
Those look like crouching guys right there.

3993
04:17:06,450 --> 04:17:08,310
I don't remember where to go either.

3994
04:17:08,690 --> 04:17:09,690
That's all good.

3995
04:17:09,830 --> 04:17:10,490
Someone asked me...

3996
04:17:12,010 --> 04:17:13,610
Look at the butt.

3997
04:17:24,890 --> 04:17:26,870
Why does it look like two guys there?

3998
04:17:27,010 --> 04:17:27,910
Oh my gosh, hold on.

3999
04:17:29,090 --> 04:17:31,590
I feel like I'm insane right now.

4000
04:17:39,480 --> 04:17:41,100
I hate everything right now.

4001
04:17:41,220 --> 04:17:42,460
I hate everything right now.

4002
04:17:56,360 --> 04:17:57,980
My camo is 35.

4003
04:17:58,680 --> 04:18:00,640
If he comes over here, I'm so caught.

4004
04:18:03,920 --> 04:18:04,940
Don't do it!

4005
04:18:05,440 --> 04:18:06,180
Alert, go down!

4006
04:18:07,000 --> 04:18:08,000
Alert, go down!

4007
04:18:08,200 --> 04:18:08,660
Faster!

4008
04:18:10,660 --> 04:18:11,220
Faster!

4009
04:18:12,960 --> 04:18:14,400
Okay, he's retreating.

4010
04:18:17,860 --> 04:18:19,860
My literal stress.

4011
04:18:20,240 --> 04:18:21,640
My actual stress levels.

4012
04:18:26,860 --> 04:18:28,580
No, what?

4013
04:18:33,080 --> 04:18:34,580
I'm so angry.

4014
04:18:35,120 --> 04:18:36,960
I couldn't tell where they were.

4015
04:18:39,860 --> 04:18:41,620
Get in the dark.

4016
04:18:46,190 --> 04:18:47,830
They come through here.

4017
04:18:50,890 --> 04:18:53,870
Hold on, I'm gonna also...

4018
04:18:53,870 --> 04:18:54,810
Camouflage.

4019
04:18:55,070 --> 04:18:56,650
We're also gonna put on a face.

4020
04:18:57,130 --> 04:18:58,870
We're gonna be face camo.

4021
04:19:03,510 --> 04:19:05,530
There we go, 83.

4022
04:19:06,090 --> 04:19:07,610
Might be okay, actually.

4023
04:19:11,650 --> 04:19:14,850
I don't see anyone, but...

4024
04:19:16,990 --> 04:19:21,770
This is what we just picked up from laughing octopus.

4025
04:19:26,050 --> 04:19:26,930
Serious question.

4026
04:19:27,150 --> 04:19:30,230
In regards to both the frogs and the Beauty and the Beast unit, would you or not?

4027
04:19:31,850 --> 04:19:34,330
I think that's a silly question, right?

4028
04:19:35,370 --> 04:19:37,590
I think everybody here would say, yeah.

4029
04:19:44,130 --> 04:19:45,810
We are of yeah consensus.

4030
04:19:46,670 --> 04:19:47,030
Yeah.

4031
04:19:49,350 --> 04:19:52,130
Okay, sorry for the...

4032
04:19:52,130 --> 04:19:54,530
Alright, back to your regularly scheduled programming.

4033
04:19:59,590 --> 04:20:02,910
Are they coming through here?

4034
04:20:04,650 --> 04:20:05,550
What just happened?

4035
04:20:07,510 --> 04:20:07,750
What?

4036
04:20:07,910 --> 04:20:08,610
What?

4037
04:20:08,610 --> 04:20:09,050
What?

4038
04:20:09,170 --> 04:20:09,290
What?

4039
04:20:10,390 --> 04:20:11,570
What was that?

4040
04:20:18,560 --> 04:20:20,980
Okay, if we're here...

4041
04:20:20,980 --> 04:20:23,940
Since I already got caught, I'm gonna be...

4042
04:20:23,940 --> 04:20:26,080
We're gonna have the face camo on.

4043
04:20:26,420 --> 04:20:27,640
Oh, truck doors.

4044
04:20:31,740 --> 04:20:35,880
We're gonna have the extra camo since I got caught just now.

4045
04:20:36,100 --> 04:20:37,520
And I feel like a dummy dumb.

4046
04:20:37,920 --> 04:20:41,360
Thinking that the damn wall with some guy is crouching.

4047
04:20:42,700 --> 04:20:43,920
Oh, there he is.

4048
04:20:46,680 --> 04:20:48,000
I can't get him from here.

4049
04:20:52,770 --> 04:20:53,530
Slow.

4050
04:20:54,230 --> 04:20:54,770
Slow.

4051
04:20:55,850 --> 04:20:56,610
Slow.

4052
04:20:57,470 --> 04:20:58,170
Slow.

4053
04:21:06,390 --> 04:21:08,870
You go back to facing that way.

4054
04:21:11,670 --> 04:21:12,330
Yeah.

4055
04:21:13,790 --> 04:21:15,710
He lies down like my cat.

4056
04:21:16,290 --> 04:21:17,690
Okay, over a little.

4057
04:21:22,820 --> 04:21:24,120
I look like a cheetah.

4058
04:21:35,000 --> 04:21:35,800
You!

4059
04:21:36,400 --> 04:21:37,760
You bastard.

4060
04:21:39,080 --> 04:21:39,540
You!

4061
04:21:39,880 --> 04:21:41,060
You got me before!

4062
04:21:42,100 --> 04:21:43,840
Oh gosh, my eyes.

4063
04:21:43,900 --> 04:21:44,480
Sorry everybody.

4064
04:21:49,160 --> 04:21:51,080
Seems to be this way?

4065
04:21:52,120 --> 04:21:53,040
Oh yeah.

4066
04:21:55,800 --> 04:21:57,620
I don't know.

4067
04:21:57,780 --> 04:21:59,920
They all look the same.

4068
04:22:00,040 --> 04:22:01,760
Naomi, you damn big ass bee.

4069
04:22:01,920 --> 04:22:02,880
I can't tell.

4070
04:22:05,340 --> 04:22:06,280
Yes, this way?

4071
04:22:09,200 --> 04:22:10,680
She got a big fee.

4072
04:22:13,560 --> 04:22:14,660
Master key?

4073
04:22:16,500 --> 04:22:17,760
That's sold for 9000.

4074
04:22:19,920 --> 04:22:21,660
Sorry snake, you're just gonna have to deal.

4075
04:22:21,860 --> 04:22:23,760
Oh gosh, I just realized our...

4076
04:22:42,270 --> 04:22:43,650
I'm looking for guys.

4077
04:22:48,330 --> 04:22:49,170
Looking around.

4078
04:22:52,910 --> 04:22:56,530
I didn't remember I think we went through the water, did we not?

4079
04:23:05,110 --> 04:23:06,510
No pee pee here.

4080
04:23:07,030 --> 04:23:08,330
Don't drink the water, snake.

4081
04:23:12,660 --> 04:23:13,880
Or there is, maybe.

4082
04:23:14,940 --> 04:23:16,740
Extra alert for pee pee man.

4083
04:23:20,520 --> 04:23:21,300
Okay, hold on.

4084
04:23:22,040 --> 04:23:23,940
Let's use a solid eye just in case.

4085
04:23:25,060 --> 04:23:28,640
Okay, looks like everything is going on over there, so...

4086
04:23:30,080 --> 04:23:32,680
Whatever is going on over there, so...

4087
04:23:32,680 --> 04:23:34,260
We're not gonna go that direction obviously.

4088
04:23:35,040 --> 04:23:36,420
We're gonna go through the water.

4089
04:23:51,200 --> 04:23:51,680
Peculiar.

4090
04:23:51,680 --> 04:23:51,860
Peculiar.

4091
04:23:59,520 --> 04:24:00,800
This way?

4092
04:24:01,960 --> 04:24:04,560
I feel like there's gotta be someone leading her, you know?

4093
04:24:06,260 --> 04:24:07,580
She got princess carried.

4094
04:24:07,740 --> 04:24:07,960
What?

4095
04:24:14,880 --> 04:24:17,640
She's so needy, that one.

4096
04:24:18,580 --> 04:24:18,920
Wrong?

4097
04:24:19,560 --> 04:24:20,180
Wrong?

4098
04:24:21,420 --> 04:24:22,560
Left, okay.

4099
04:24:22,560 --> 04:24:23,300
Wait, what?

4100
04:24:24,880 --> 04:24:27,360
Oh, because I said just her footprints disappear.

4101
04:24:27,640 --> 04:24:27,860
Okay.

4102
04:24:29,880 --> 04:24:31,020
Thank you guys.

4103
04:24:35,290 --> 04:24:35,930
Alright.

4104
04:24:37,490 --> 04:24:39,350
I see whoever is over there.

4105
04:24:42,230 --> 04:24:43,710
Stress is going down.

4106
04:24:46,930 --> 04:24:48,850
So needy, I know.

4107
04:24:52,560 --> 04:24:53,980
Alright, snake, you good?

4108
04:24:54,920 --> 04:24:56,180
You okay buddy?

4109
04:25:29,940 --> 04:25:31,300
Your eyes!

4110
04:25:31,520 --> 04:25:31,860
Shield!

4111
04:25:36,940 --> 04:25:38,300
So, forward.

4112
04:25:39,140 --> 04:25:41,000
Because they all converge.

4113
04:25:41,300 --> 04:25:42,320
They all go the same way.

4114
04:25:58,720 --> 04:25:59,200
Sure.

4115
04:25:59,800 --> 04:26:00,940
I don't know.

4116
04:26:07,050 --> 04:26:08,990
Sounded like her voice came from the right too.

4117
04:26:09,150 --> 04:26:09,710
It did!

4118
04:26:10,470 --> 04:26:11,550
So I'm not sure.

4119
04:26:13,190 --> 04:26:15,130
Unless they walked backwards with her.

4120
04:26:15,250 --> 04:26:17,250
She held them up and made them walk backwards.

4121
04:26:33,870 --> 04:26:35,050
Who's in the trees?

4122
04:26:40,230 --> 04:26:41,450
What's over here?

4123
04:26:41,590 --> 04:26:43,090
Do you see that on the radar?

4124
04:26:52,140 --> 04:26:53,120
Is there a person?

4125
04:26:54,080 --> 04:26:55,360
Maybe not.

4126
04:26:58,120 --> 04:26:59,760
Oh no,

4127
04:27:03,370 --> 04:27:03,910
there was.

4128
04:27:07,750 --> 04:27:08,990
Oh there definitely was!

4129
04:27:09,430 --> 04:27:09,930
Somewhere.

4130
04:27:10,690 --> 04:27:11,770
I have no idea where.

4131
04:27:14,990 --> 04:27:15,810
Hello?

4132
04:27:17,910 --> 04:27:19,130
Where at?

4133
04:27:20,230 --> 04:27:21,470
Whatever, just keep going.

4134
04:27:24,130 --> 04:27:25,910
Just keep on, keep on.

4135
04:27:25,910 --> 04:27:26,950
Come on, snake.

4136
04:27:27,550 --> 04:27:28,510
You got this.

4137
04:27:30,370 --> 04:27:31,910
You and your...

4138
04:27:48,140 --> 04:27:49,680
He was not on the radar.

4139
04:27:54,610 --> 04:27:56,010
That guy is not on the radar.

4140
04:27:59,490 --> 04:28:00,950
I think there is someone else coming up.

4141
04:28:05,190 --> 04:28:06,150
I can't tell.

4142
04:28:06,630 --> 04:28:08,370
The birds just flew so I feel like...

4143
04:28:09,370 --> 04:28:10,130
I don't know.

4144
04:28:10,350 --> 04:28:11,450
Wait, where am I going?

4145
04:28:11,830 --> 04:28:12,850
Am I going the right way?

4146
04:28:16,150 --> 04:28:17,090
Nice save.

4147
04:28:17,130 --> 04:28:18,110
Thank you.

4148
04:28:24,990 --> 04:28:26,630
The birds were disturbed.

4149
04:28:26,810 --> 04:28:29,370
I know, that's why I thought something was...

4150
04:28:38,380 --> 04:28:40,160
Hopefully I'm going the correct way.

4151
04:28:48,080 --> 04:28:48,880
That's a tree.

4152
04:28:50,960 --> 04:28:52,620
I can't believe that guy didn't show up though.

4153
04:28:55,580 --> 04:28:56,300
That's crazy.

4154
04:29:06,890 --> 04:29:09,110
I thought he was going to detonate it.

4155
04:29:13,810 --> 04:29:17,990
I thought he was going to lie down on it and detonate it.

4156
04:29:18,570 --> 04:29:20,370
Maybe it's a better thing that he didn't.

4157
04:29:22,570 --> 04:29:26,410
Why are these guys not showing up on my solid eye though?

4158
04:29:26,610 --> 04:29:27,070
Scary.

4159
04:29:32,490 --> 04:29:33,350
Wait, hold on.

4160
04:29:36,970 --> 04:29:37,990
Come on Mark 2.

4161
04:29:51,790 --> 04:29:53,490
There we go.

4162
04:29:54,350 --> 04:29:55,070
Thank you.

4163
04:29:58,150 --> 04:29:59,730
The guinea pigs!

4164
04:30:00,650 --> 04:30:02,750
They went separate ways here, right?

4165
04:30:03,150 --> 04:30:05,170
Sorry for your eyes again.

4166
04:30:12,290 --> 04:30:13,690
It's a little freaky.

4167
04:30:15,070 --> 04:30:16,970
This is actually so freaky.

4168
04:30:18,910 --> 04:30:21,150
This is actually so freaky.

4169
04:30:23,310 --> 04:30:24,690
Doesn't this lead to something?

4170
04:30:24,730 --> 04:30:26,390
I can't remember what it leads to.

4171
04:30:31,010 --> 04:30:32,130
Let's check it out.

4172
04:30:34,070 --> 04:30:36,430
We have the horde of guinea pigs here.

4173
04:30:38,250 --> 04:30:40,130
Death stranding reel, right?

4174
04:30:40,290 --> 04:30:42,710
It's a true death stranding moment.

4175
04:30:43,590 --> 04:30:43,890
Hello!

4176
04:30:47,850 --> 04:30:48,970
So cute!

4177
04:30:48,970 --> 04:30:49,170
So cute!

4178
04:30:55,710 --> 04:30:58,490
It's actually kind of spooky.

4179
04:31:03,990 --> 04:31:06,070
It's pretty spooky but...

4180
04:31:12,590 --> 04:31:13,770
Get the camo.

4181
04:31:13,890 --> 04:31:14,690
You can get camo here?

4182
04:31:21,070 --> 04:31:21,670
Freaky!

4183
04:31:35,970 --> 04:31:37,810
I don't want that guy to wake up.

4184
04:31:39,750 --> 04:31:41,330
They're the cutest rodents.

4185
04:31:42,070 --> 04:31:43,190
Yeah, guinea pigs are pretty cute.

4186
04:31:44,470 --> 04:31:46,750
I don't think I've ever seen a wild guinea pig.

4187
04:31:46,990 --> 04:31:51,250
There's just some animals that are like hard to think about them being...

4188
04:31:53,490 --> 04:31:55,850
Like a wild animal, you know what I mean?

4189
04:31:58,070 --> 04:31:59,990
Sorry for your eyes once again.

4190
04:32:00,850 --> 04:32:01,870
Oh, just kidding.

4191
04:32:04,450 --> 04:32:05,990
So they split up here.

4192
04:32:06,590 --> 04:32:08,670
So this is probably hers, right?

4193
04:32:08,790 --> 04:32:09,350
To the left?

4194
04:32:15,930 --> 04:32:16,370
No?

4195
04:32:23,270 --> 04:32:24,750
Looks like... wait, I can't tell.

4196
04:32:24,890 --> 04:32:25,250
I don't know.

4197
04:32:26,130 --> 04:32:27,770
Because over there, there was a bunch of footprints.

4198
04:32:29,310 --> 04:32:30,310
To the right.

4199
04:32:32,770 --> 04:32:33,990
Who's calling me?

4200
04:32:55,450 --> 04:32:56,170
Think!

4201
04:32:56,310 --> 04:32:56,970
God!

4202
04:32:59,150 --> 04:33:00,370
God, think, Snake!

4203
04:33:04,870 --> 04:33:06,250
Naomi Hunter?

4204
04:33:14,800 --> 04:33:16,800
Well, that's really heavy footage.

4205
04:33:16,800 --> 04:33:19,880
Footprints, and then you have light footprints here.

4206
04:33:19,920 --> 04:33:20,720
I can't tell!

4207
04:33:22,100 --> 04:33:23,840
These are her shoes.

4208
04:33:28,290 --> 04:33:31,030
These are her shoes, but...

4209
04:33:33,110 --> 04:33:34,550
Some might say Jaeger.

4210
04:33:34,850 --> 04:33:35,090
Yeah.

4211
04:33:38,350 --> 04:33:40,010
Wait, what?

4212
04:33:43,440 --> 04:33:44,680
Who just woke up?

4213
04:33:46,780 --> 04:33:47,700
From where?

4214
04:33:48,440 --> 04:33:48,920
Oh,

4215
04:33:52,010 --> 04:33:52,350
this guy.

4216
04:33:52,670 --> 04:33:53,030
Nevermind.

4217
04:33:53,170 --> 04:33:54,270
He's got two Z's.

4218
04:33:54,890 --> 04:33:55,930
I'll just do it anyway.

4219
04:33:56,410 --> 04:33:57,350
Who just woke up?

4220
04:33:58,870 --> 04:33:59,350
Me.

4221
04:34:01,450 --> 04:34:01,930
Hello?

4222
04:34:02,650 --> 04:34:02,870
Hello?

4223
04:34:03,750 --> 04:34:05,210
Wait, I think someone's coming this way.

4224
04:34:05,550 --> 04:34:07,430
Oh, I think the froggies start coming.

4225
04:34:08,670 --> 04:34:08,990
Right?

4226
04:34:09,350 --> 04:34:09,910
Am I crazy?

4227
04:34:17,380 --> 04:34:18,680
Or I'm not sure.

4228
04:34:18,880 --> 04:34:19,240
Nevermind.

4229
04:34:19,420 --> 04:34:19,920
I don't know.

4230
04:34:20,020 --> 04:34:20,660
I thought some...

4231
04:34:23,420 --> 04:34:24,000
Okay.

4232
04:34:24,640 --> 04:34:25,640
So this way.

4233
04:34:27,900 --> 04:34:28,760
Right way.

4234
04:34:37,250 --> 04:34:39,050
Probably a frog with that voice.

4235
04:34:39,190 --> 04:34:40,190
Yeah, that's what I thought.

4236
04:34:41,130 --> 04:34:41,990
The froggies.

4237
04:35:03,230 --> 04:35:06,850
I'm marching along through the grass.

4238
04:35:07,110 --> 04:35:10,210
I'm not going very fast.

4239
04:35:10,410 --> 04:35:12,230
But I'll get there one day.

4240
04:35:12,550 --> 04:35:17,670
I'll rescue the lady and we'll live happily ever after.

4241
04:35:17,950 --> 04:35:20,710
I'm marching on through the grass.

4242
04:35:20,870 --> 04:35:24,030
I'm not going very fast.

4243
04:35:24,250 --> 04:35:26,050
But I gotta be swift.

4244
04:35:26,390 --> 04:35:27,790
I gotta be smart.

4245
04:35:27,790 --> 04:35:31,510
Or else she will die.

4246
04:35:38,590 --> 04:35:44,190
Sorry, rhyming is not my strong point.

4247
04:35:51,070 --> 04:35:54,790
I am super...

4248
04:35:55,790 --> 04:35:57,390
Gosh, you scared me Otacon.

4249
04:35:58,350 --> 04:35:59,610
Where did they go?

4250
04:36:28,920 --> 04:36:29,720
Is

4251
04:36:36,560 --> 04:36:38,240
someone coming up on me?

4252
04:36:41,280 --> 04:36:42,700
I don't know!

4253
04:36:44,240 --> 04:36:47,180
That doesn't look like...

4254
04:36:48,200 --> 04:36:49,980
I'm so lost.

4255
04:36:54,160 --> 04:36:55,560
Loud ass snoring.

4256
04:36:55,720 --> 04:36:56,160
I know, right?

4257
04:37:02,530 --> 04:37:04,210
Do these look like her?

4258
04:37:05,090 --> 04:37:06,190
Does the map help?

4259
04:37:07,950 --> 04:37:09,030
Not really.

4260
04:37:11,050 --> 04:37:12,350
Not really.

4261
04:37:15,510 --> 04:37:16,390
And

4262
04:37:19,770 --> 04:37:22,230
then this is like...

4263
04:37:22,230 --> 04:37:23,750
They backtrack or something.

4264
04:37:26,690 --> 04:37:28,330
I hear a helicopter.

4265
04:37:32,590 --> 04:37:33,470
If

4266
04:37:36,950 --> 04:37:40,250
I get this guy, is someone else gonna be like...

4267
04:37:52,160 --> 04:37:54,800
We're going A-way.

4268
04:37:57,060 --> 04:38:00,800
We're going a direction...

4269
04:38:01,580 --> 04:38:03,800
That could be...

4270
04:38:06,340 --> 04:38:07,540
Correct?

4271
04:38:10,300 --> 04:38:10,900
Or...

4272
04:38:11,500 --> 04:38:12,640
Incorrect.

4273
04:38:19,300 --> 04:38:20,780
Oh my god.

4274
04:38:21,200 --> 04:38:22,920
I hate this part.

4275
04:38:29,470 --> 04:38:31,350
We're going A...

4276
04:38:31,350 --> 04:38:33,210
I feel like it's not this way.

4277
04:38:37,770 --> 04:38:39,350
You really like this part?

4278
04:38:39,510 --> 04:38:41,890
I feel like anybody who wants to be...

4279
04:38:41,890 --> 04:38:45,290
A Scooby-Doo mystery gang would really like this part.

4280
04:38:46,590 --> 04:38:47,670
Oh my gosh.

4281
04:38:48,170 --> 04:38:50,390
I feel like it's not this way because...

4282
04:38:51,310 --> 04:38:53,950
Because look, we could've gone two different ways then.

4283
04:38:55,890 --> 04:38:56,370
Right?

4284
04:38:56,590 --> 04:38:59,270
I feel like they're like, you wanna only go one way.

4285
04:38:59,690 --> 04:39:02,570
I feel like it's gotta be this little...

4286
04:39:02,570 --> 04:39:04,010
It's like a stomach, right?

4287
04:39:07,290 --> 04:39:08,350
Right here.

4288
04:39:15,790 --> 04:39:17,010
Yeah, you think so?

4289
04:39:17,090 --> 04:39:17,270
Okay.

4290
04:39:19,590 --> 04:39:20,750
Would you like a hint?

4291
04:39:20,910 --> 04:39:21,470
Yes!

4292
04:39:21,650 --> 04:39:22,470
I would love a hint.

4293
04:39:24,010 --> 04:39:26,030
I would love a hint.

4294
04:39:28,730 --> 04:39:29,670
Hint time!

4295
04:39:32,370 --> 04:39:34,710
Engage the timer or the inner Columbo.

4296
04:39:35,650 --> 04:39:37,330
Engage the timer, Columbo.

4297
04:39:40,210 --> 04:39:41,330
No hint.

4298
04:39:41,390 --> 04:39:42,450
It's not your stream!

4299
04:39:48,650 --> 04:39:49,630
Back to sleep.

4300
04:39:52,710 --> 04:39:54,550
Yawn, yawn, yawn.

4301
04:39:55,330 --> 04:39:56,570
Back to sleep.

4302
04:40:13,350 --> 04:40:15,010
You don't have anything for me?

4303
04:40:16,990 --> 04:40:18,270
Oh, I hear the helicopter.

4304
04:40:22,200 --> 04:40:22,520
Okay.

4305
04:40:25,180 --> 04:40:28,200
One of the footsteps are Naomi's.

4306
04:40:30,280 --> 04:40:32,420
Isn't the helicopter a good thing?

4307
04:40:34,640 --> 04:40:35,960
Isn't that where they meet up?

4308
04:41:38,780 --> 04:41:40,880
Is it like right over there?

4309
04:42:00,910 --> 04:42:03,270
Oh, I forgot to take off the mask.

4310
04:42:05,050 --> 04:42:06,150
We got Deadpool.

4311
04:42:14,510 --> 04:42:20,410
We should be close to the end of the act soonish, I believe.

4312
04:42:21,010 --> 04:42:24,170
I know there's like a chase...

4313
04:42:24,170 --> 04:42:25,850
There's like a scene with cars and...

4314
04:42:25,850 --> 04:42:30,430
Oh my

4315
04:42:35,440 --> 04:42:37,860
god, what are you doing with that guy?

4316
04:42:37,960 --> 04:42:39,120
You suck so much.

4317
04:42:41,260 --> 04:42:42,400
It's Vamp.

4318
04:42:43,000 --> 04:42:44,000
I'm sure of it.

4319
04:42:55,660 --> 04:42:58,220
We could snipe Naomi.

4320
04:43:01,280 --> 04:43:03,520
Let me play, please!

4321
04:43:04,420 --> 04:43:05,200
MGS3!

4322
04:43:05,880 --> 04:43:07,380
I wanna get her!

4323
04:43:10,140 --> 04:43:11,480
What would her name be?

4324
04:43:12,660 --> 04:43:13,380
The bitch.

4325
04:43:13,680 --> 04:43:14,900
Sorry, no.

4326
04:43:15,200 --> 04:43:15,940
It's not nice.

4327
04:43:21,600 --> 04:43:23,300
This is a cancer!

4328
04:43:25,680 --> 04:43:27,000
Too far.

4329
04:43:27,540 --> 04:43:29,340
Come on, take the shot!

4330
04:43:29,940 --> 04:43:31,700
Take the shot, Snake!

4331
04:43:32,460 --> 04:43:35,400
Get her straight through the eyes.

4332
04:43:35,600 --> 04:43:37,060
Straight in the middle.

4333
04:43:38,800 --> 04:43:39,940
Take the shot!

4334
04:43:41,540 --> 04:43:42,900
Run, person!

4335
04:43:53,830 --> 04:43:55,310
Snake, how could you miss?

4336
04:43:55,430 --> 04:43:56,930
Gosh, Vamp is such a freak.

4337
04:43:57,650 --> 04:44:01,210
Now he's got a second matching bullet hole.

4338
04:44:03,150 --> 04:44:04,250
Guys, Vamp is here.

4339
04:44:04,250 --> 04:44:04,770
Begin.

4340
04:44:07,010 --> 04:44:08,890
We'll use his blood.

4341
04:44:09,370 --> 04:44:10,770
It could get intense.

4342
04:44:11,450 --> 04:44:12,890
Brace yourselves.

4343
04:44:14,310 --> 04:44:15,570
Shots, all of you.

4344
04:44:15,810 --> 04:44:16,870
Yes, sir.

4345
04:44:17,050 --> 04:44:19,430
I'll be taking in half.

4346
04:44:21,230 --> 04:44:22,630
Oh my god.

4347
04:44:26,210 --> 04:44:27,730
Someone's mooing.

4348
04:44:30,990 --> 04:44:33,290
I'm not cut out to be a soldier, guys.

4349
04:44:34,710 --> 04:44:36,350
I could never take the shot.

4350
04:44:37,710 --> 04:44:38,550
Those shots.

4351
04:44:38,850 --> 04:44:40,130
I could take these shots.

4352
04:44:43,610 --> 04:44:44,110
Kill me.

4353
04:44:44,530 --> 04:44:46,750
Get a little closer to the edge of that door, would you?

4354
04:44:51,530 --> 04:44:53,490
Just gotta take a few more steps closer.

4355
04:45:01,970 --> 04:45:04,250
Third time Phil Lamarr got shot in the face.

4356
04:45:05,990 --> 04:45:06,870
What's this?

4357
04:45:07,670 --> 04:45:08,030
Oh no.

4358
04:45:08,570 --> 04:45:08,890
Snake!

4359
04:45:09,970 --> 04:45:10,390
Oh no!

4360
04:45:24,280 --> 04:45:26,660
You're so useful right now.

4361
04:45:33,990 --> 04:45:35,870
Barfing in a mask seems awful.

4362
04:45:36,230 --> 04:45:39,010
Oh gosh, I didn't even think about that.

4363
04:45:39,110 --> 04:45:39,770
That's horrible.

4364
04:45:41,910 --> 04:45:43,130
It's not working.

4365
04:45:47,360 --> 04:45:51,560
That guy just pooped blood or something.

4366
04:45:51,660 --> 04:45:52,240
What happened?

4367
04:45:52,920 --> 04:45:54,080
Or maybe I shot him.

4368
04:46:00,940 --> 04:46:02,460
Johnny moment reveal.

4369
04:46:02,880 --> 04:46:05,000
Oh gosh, not the cows!

4370
04:46:10,900 --> 04:46:13,900
Why is the helicopter not taking off yet?

4371
04:46:15,600 --> 04:46:16,120
Woah!

4372
04:46:19,220 --> 04:46:19,740
Pumpkin!

4373
04:46:31,850 --> 04:46:32,970
Step on it!

4374
04:46:36,130 --> 04:46:37,030
Alright, pick me up.

4375
04:46:44,160 --> 04:46:44,680
Gross.

4376
04:46:47,780 --> 04:46:51,000
Can you imagine if they just opened the helicopter?

4377
04:46:51,260 --> 04:46:56,100
Or they closed the doors while he's still down there and he just topples over inside.

4378
04:46:58,520 --> 04:46:59,160
Hi!

4379
04:47:01,640 --> 04:47:02,280
Rabbit!

4380
04:47:03,160 --> 04:47:05,840
Oh yeah!

4381
04:47:06,480 --> 04:47:07,400
Shoot those!

4382
04:47:09,160 --> 04:47:09,320
Yip!

4383
04:47:09,800 --> 04:47:10,260
Gecko.

4384
04:47:10,420 --> 04:47:10,820
Why?

4385
04:47:11,120 --> 04:47:11,700
Cow move.

4386
04:47:16,580 --> 04:47:17,220
Oh.

4387
04:47:19,820 --> 04:47:22,760
It doesn't sound...I don't hear the can you walk part.

4388
04:47:22,820 --> 04:47:23,940
I just hear walk.

4389
04:47:24,440 --> 04:47:25,780
It's like he's commanding her.

4390
04:47:27,600 --> 04:47:29,520
Don't let Otacon near her.

4391
04:47:30,040 --> 04:47:31,800
Don't let him talk to her at all.

4392
04:47:32,180 --> 04:47:40,860
Okay, I know the little mark 2 is cute, but don't let him...don't let him talk to her.

4393
04:47:47,820 --> 04:47:48,420
Walk.

4394
04:47:48,700 --> 04:47:49,820
Rio, walk.

4395
04:47:55,380 --> 04:47:56,360
Little monkey.

4396
04:47:57,380 --> 04:47:59,840
The monkey looks so satisfied.

4397
04:47:59,920 --> 04:48:00,460
So cute.

4398
04:48:07,420 --> 04:48:09,200
What is happening?

4399
04:48:10,860 --> 04:48:11,820
What?

4400
04:48:14,640 --> 04:48:16,120
Oh no.

4401
04:48:18,520 --> 04:48:19,620
There were few survivors.

4402
04:48:23,730 --> 04:48:25,710
Did the monkey drink from that first?

4403
04:48:25,850 --> 04:48:26,970
I think so!

4404
04:48:27,870 --> 04:48:28,450
Naomi.

4405
04:48:28,830 --> 04:48:30,850
She has...she's fine.

4406
04:48:33,970 --> 04:48:37,350
I got the PS2 MGS essential collection today.

4407
04:48:37,410 --> 04:48:37,950
Nice!

4408
04:48:40,510 --> 04:48:41,230
Alrighty.

4409
04:48:43,510 --> 04:48:46,110
This is what they mean by twin peaks.

4410
04:48:49,110 --> 04:48:49,830
Okay.

4411
04:48:53,690 --> 04:48:54,090
Okay.

4412
04:48:54,370 --> 04:48:55,310
How do I shoot this thing?

4413
04:48:57,070 --> 04:48:57,570
Oh gosh.

4414
04:48:57,890 --> 04:48:58,470
Who's shooting me?

4415
04:49:01,910 --> 04:49:02,530
I did.

4416
04:49:02,970 --> 04:49:03,430
Yeah, I did.

4417
04:49:04,530 --> 04:49:05,610
Sorry, I have to shoot people.

4418
04:49:06,710 --> 04:49:07,890
I have to...Oh my god!

4419
04:49:10,390 --> 04:49:11,170
Okay, Otacon.

4420
04:49:11,310 --> 04:49:12,230
How about you do it then?

4421
04:49:16,350 --> 04:49:18,150
How about you do it then, Otacon?

4422
04:49:18,150 --> 04:49:18,490
Come on!

4423
04:49:24,490 --> 04:49:24,950
I...there's...

4424
04:49:24,950 --> 04:49:25,850
Is that the last guy?

4425
04:49:26,710 --> 04:49:27,170
Sorry.

4426
04:49:27,430 --> 04:49:28,610
Oh my gosh, there's still another one?

4427
04:49:32,350 --> 04:49:32,770
Okay.

4428
04:49:34,630 --> 04:49:34,930
Okay.

4429
04:49:55,380 --> 04:49:57,300
Oh my gosh!

4430
04:49:57,880 --> 04:49:58,480
Back up!

4431
04:49:58,660 --> 04:49:58,820
Back up!

4432
04:49:58,860 --> 04:49:59,180
Back up!

4433
04:49:59,220 --> 04:49:59,500
Back up!

4434
04:50:00,180 --> 04:50:00,860
I'm trying!

4435
04:50:01,000 --> 04:50:01,240
I'm trying!

4436
04:50:01,360 --> 04:50:03,020
There's a guy hanging on for dear life.

4437
04:50:11,560 --> 04:50:12,460
What's the best part?

4438
04:50:12,840 --> 04:50:14,780
Oh my gosh.

4439
04:50:15,000 --> 04:50:17,000
Get off and fight that guy.

4440
04:50:17,960 --> 04:50:18,540
Yeah, get him off.

4441
04:50:18,580 --> 04:50:19,500
Okay, and back on.

4442
04:50:19,980 --> 04:50:20,220
Okay.

4443
04:50:22,660 --> 04:50:24,020
What's the best place to shoot them?

4444
04:50:32,880 --> 04:50:33,620
The legs?

4445
04:50:33,760 --> 04:50:33,940
Okay.

4446
04:50:35,460 --> 04:50:35,860
Nice!

4447
04:50:38,280 --> 04:50:39,020
Sorry guys.

4448
04:50:39,640 --> 04:50:40,540
We got too close.

4449
04:50:44,000 --> 04:50:46,660
I hear a guy being like...

4450
04:50:58,970 --> 04:51:02,330
Do I explode them or like...

4451
04:51:02,330 --> 04:51:04,290
We're just kinda rolling around on the ground here.

4452
04:51:12,080 --> 04:51:13,880
Oh, they do recover it seems.

4453
04:51:14,040 --> 04:51:14,200
Okay.

4454
04:51:14,900 --> 04:51:15,320
Understood!

4455
04:51:38,450 --> 04:51:39,030
Oh my gosh!

4456
04:51:39,830 --> 04:51:40,790
Go away!

4457
04:51:42,090 --> 04:51:42,670
You're welcome.

4458
04:51:43,110 --> 04:51:43,770
Can I hold

4459
04:51:54,160 --> 04:51:54,260
on?

4460
04:51:54,320 --> 04:51:55,720
That was the place to farm.

4461
04:51:56,020 --> 04:51:57,840
It must have been those guys in the back corner.

4462
04:51:58,000 --> 04:51:59,220
And then they would keep respawning.

4463
04:51:59,600 --> 04:52:00,500
And then I would get him.

4464
04:52:00,840 --> 04:52:02,020
And then...

4465
04:52:02,020 --> 04:52:03,320
I know where.

4466
04:52:05,660 --> 04:52:06,620
There's still...

4467
04:52:06,620 --> 04:52:07,520
Oh no!

4468
04:52:11,920 --> 04:52:12,620
A what?

4469
04:52:13,900 --> 04:52:14,840
Metal Gear Solid?

4470
04:52:17,080 --> 04:52:17,680
Shoot!

4471
04:52:18,040 --> 04:52:20,300
Oh no!

4472
04:52:23,740 --> 04:52:26,420
We got Metal Gear Solid on our butts!

4473
04:52:27,480 --> 04:52:28,760
Do I open this door?

4474
04:52:29,800 --> 04:52:30,140
Open up!

4475
04:52:31,720 --> 04:52:32,740
Yeah, I am.

4476
04:52:33,140 --> 04:52:33,640
I am.

4477
04:52:34,240 --> 04:52:35,140
I 100% am.

4478
04:52:42,340 --> 04:52:45,560
Okay, I'm getting two instructions at once man.

4479
04:52:46,020 --> 04:52:46,940
What do you want me to do?

4480
04:52:47,480 --> 04:52:49,280
I'm too slow to turn around.

4481
04:52:50,620 --> 04:52:51,920
I'm trying to turn!

4482
04:53:01,130 --> 04:53:03,530
The back seaters are back at it.

4483
04:53:04,610 --> 04:53:05,870
Stay away from that gate.

4484
04:53:06,030 --> 04:53:06,610
Oh, we got it.

4485
04:53:08,130 --> 04:53:11,190
I think he could've... I think he could've run into that.

4486
04:53:11,670 --> 04:53:12,490
I'm not gonna lie.

4487
04:53:14,650 --> 04:53:17,430
I think... I think he could've...

4488
04:53:17,430 --> 04:53:19,350
Yeah, turning is so clunky in this part.

4489
04:53:20,050 --> 04:53:21,810
He could've 100% run through that.

4490
04:53:22,750 --> 04:53:23,230
Woo!

4491
04:53:25,130 --> 04:53:28,530
When are they gonna make a Metal Gear Solid amusement park ride?

4492
04:53:30,030 --> 04:53:30,510
Speed!

4493
04:53:32,010 --> 04:53:32,490
Speed!

4494
04:53:34,030 --> 04:53:36,190
I'll take down anything in our way!

4495
04:53:37,290 --> 04:53:38,090
What is that?

4496
04:53:39,210 --> 04:53:40,090
It's a log!

4497
04:53:44,980 --> 04:53:45,940
Oh gosh!

4498
04:53:47,460 --> 04:53:48,160
I'm trying to turn.

4499
04:53:50,100 --> 04:53:50,480
Oh god.

4500
04:53:50,820 --> 04:53:51,340
Wait, where did he go?

4501
04:53:51,380 --> 04:53:51,760
Where did he go?

4502
04:53:51,760 --> 04:53:53,500
Oh my god, this part is so icky.

4503
04:53:54,360 --> 04:53:54,980
I'm trying to turn!

4504
04:53:55,280 --> 04:53:55,940
I'm trying to turn!

4505
04:54:09,540 --> 04:54:11,880
Non-lethally removing guys from the APC.

4506
04:54:12,360 --> 04:54:14,640
Go to load with the caltrain blazer, right?

4507
04:54:14,960 --> 04:54:15,720
Yeah, exactly!

4508
04:54:16,580 --> 04:54:17,820
This is all non-lethal!

4509
04:54:19,000 --> 04:54:19,320
Baby!

4510
04:54:21,680 --> 04:54:23,240
I am you.

4511
04:54:23,580 --> 04:54:24,760
Oh my gosh, snake hold on.

4512
04:54:32,380 --> 04:54:34,800
This is what Cybertrunks are supposed to be.

4513
04:54:36,800 --> 04:54:37,920
Oh, ok.

4514
04:54:38,160 --> 04:54:38,860
That works.

4515
04:54:39,660 --> 04:54:40,220
Ok!

4516
04:54:40,740 --> 04:54:41,540
Hold on tight!

4517
04:54:52,250 --> 04:54:53,990
Oh my god, thank you Otacon!

4518
04:54:55,350 --> 04:54:56,970
I just think of him talking to snakes.

4519
04:54:57,910 --> 04:54:58,750
I'm not!

4520
04:54:59,430 --> 04:55:00,310
Don't fall off!

4521
04:55:16,560 --> 04:55:18,240
I know what's about to happen here.

4522
04:55:18,420 --> 04:55:18,900
No spoilers!

4523
04:55:19,300 --> 04:55:20,180
No spoilers everybody.

4524
04:55:20,540 --> 04:55:21,240
I love this part.

4525
04:55:23,380 --> 04:55:24,660
I know what's about to happen.

4526
04:55:28,400 --> 04:55:29,540
Take off the mask.

4527
04:55:29,600 --> 04:55:30,480
I will when I can.

4528
04:55:37,720 --> 04:55:38,900
That kind of sucks.

4529
04:55:44,460 --> 04:55:48,300
This part though, even with the mask, it's not what's the important thing.

4530
04:55:48,300 --> 04:55:49,680
I think.

4531
04:55:56,520 --> 04:55:57,160
Priorities.

4532
04:55:58,400 --> 04:56:00,340
Hey, you can't fight if you are dehydrated.

4533
04:56:06,960 --> 04:56:08,580
Time for peek.

4534
04:56:09,180 --> 04:56:10,720
I love that this monkey loves her.

4535
04:56:10,720 --> 04:56:10,760
I love that this monkey loves her.

4536
04:56:15,020 --> 04:56:16,940
The monkey is obsessed with Naomi.

4537
04:56:24,610 --> 04:56:26,250
It's just like the photo.

4538
04:56:31,750 --> 04:56:32,910
Oh my god.

4539
04:56:34,270 --> 04:56:35,190
It's so funny.

4540
04:56:35,630 --> 04:56:40,110
They are so cute.

4541
04:56:41,930 --> 04:56:44,070
I like the way they sound like cicadas.

4542
04:56:44,630 --> 04:56:45,550
What's that?

4543
04:56:54,970 --> 04:56:56,250
That's Minky in the middle.

4544
04:56:57,250 --> 04:56:58,670
I don't want to touch Naomi.

4545
04:56:59,310 --> 04:57:00,670
I'll get her cooties.

4546
04:57:14,990 --> 04:57:16,590
Oh my god, Naomi!

4547
04:57:18,310 --> 04:57:20,330
She's like, well technically yes I can move.

4548
04:57:20,370 --> 04:57:21,330
I'm just a little slow.

4549
04:57:26,330 --> 04:57:28,910
What did that have to do with her leg though?

4550
04:57:34,500 --> 04:57:37,260
They mean striker mobile gun system.

4551
04:57:37,400 --> 04:57:40,000
Perfect choice for a Metal Gear Solid game ironically enough.

4552
04:57:44,940 --> 04:57:46,640
Jack is back baby!

4553
04:57:46,640 --> 04:57:46,840
Yay!

4554
04:57:49,660 --> 04:57:50,220
Yeah!

4555
04:57:51,640 --> 04:57:52,200
Doctor!

4556
04:57:59,950 --> 04:58:04,210
I can definitely imagine seeing this scene and being like, I gotta play as Raiden.

4557
04:58:14,350 --> 04:58:15,550
He's so awesome!

4558
04:58:31,860 --> 04:58:34,400
I wish he had the knives in MBR.

4559
04:58:34,920 --> 04:58:37,740
He does have some knives, but yeah...

4560
04:58:38,720 --> 04:58:43,160
For like the short, the close combat.

4561
04:59:00,020 --> 04:59:00,820
Yeah!

4562
04:59:08,120 --> 04:59:11,780
Those are what we mean when we say grippers!

4563
04:59:21,610 --> 04:59:23,450
His high heels.

4564
04:59:24,550 --> 04:59:26,530
Raiden wears heels more than I do.

4565
04:59:26,530 --> 04:59:26,610
Oh!

4566
04:59:30,130 --> 04:59:31,750
There he is!

4567
04:59:31,810 --> 04:59:32,550
A boy!

4568
04:59:33,930 --> 04:59:35,730
He's so Bishounen.

4569
04:59:37,750 --> 04:59:39,590
I started to play MGS because of Raiden.

4570
04:59:49,530 --> 04:59:51,190
Okay, show's over.

4571
04:59:53,750 --> 04:59:58,090
This trailer for MGR was hype.

4572
04:59:58,090 --> 05:00:00,170
So real.

4573
05:00:02,770 --> 05:00:04,250
The stealth camera.

4574
05:00:07,930 --> 05:00:09,630
Why do they move?

4575
05:00:10,310 --> 05:00:11,150
I don't know, it's fun!

4576
05:00:13,610 --> 05:00:14,410
Lucky!

4577
05:00:17,750 --> 05:00:20,890
We gotta talk to our little pal over there.

4578
05:00:32,920 --> 05:00:34,320
To creep people out.

4579
05:00:34,660 --> 05:00:35,380
It's in the lore.

4580
05:00:35,660 --> 05:00:36,460
That's really the reason?

4581
05:00:37,520 --> 05:00:39,900
Oh, this is where I just run, isn't it?

4582
05:00:39,940 --> 05:00:40,300
Hold on.

4583
05:00:42,460 --> 05:00:45,040
Isn't this where it says it's time to run, right?

4584
05:00:46,880 --> 05:00:48,060
I think it's time to go.

4585
05:00:50,860 --> 05:00:51,340
Wait.

4586
05:00:52,700 --> 05:00:53,480
Time to go!

4587
05:01:06,710 --> 05:01:09,150
This is one crowded...Oh my goodness!

4588
05:01:11,730 --> 05:01:12,450
Lucky!

4589
05:01:13,470 --> 05:01:14,390
I'm running!

4590
05:01:14,790 --> 05:01:15,470
Oh my gosh...

4591
05:01:25,700 --> 05:01:27,840
He one shot me.

4592
05:01:29,420 --> 05:01:30,640
He one shot me!

4593
05:01:39,730 --> 05:01:41,930
Okay fine, we are back to old Snake.

4594
05:01:43,270 --> 05:01:44,370
I understood.

4595
05:01:48,430 --> 05:01:50,710
He's not keeping them busy enough!

4596
05:02:31,650 --> 05:02:34,490
Guys, not so great going on here.

4597
05:02:42,390 --> 05:02:43,070
Okay.

4598
05:02:44,190 --> 05:02:45,570
Let me do what I did before.

4599
05:02:48,930 --> 05:02:51,470
And I'm also gonna equip my ration instead.

4600
05:02:52,330 --> 05:02:54,970
And we're gonna do this.

4601
05:02:55,170 --> 05:02:55,250
Okay.

4602
05:02:55,590 --> 05:02:55,990
Face.

4603
05:02:56,350 --> 05:02:58,630
I wish I didn't have to keep taking the face camo off.

4604
05:02:58,690 --> 05:02:59,750
Alright, let's go!

4605
05:03:02,650 --> 05:03:04,130
Unless...I went the other way.

4606
05:03:08,970 --> 05:03:09,490
But

4607
05:03:12,590 --> 05:03:16,950
he like jumps right here, so I can't really like...it's hard to...

4608
05:03:18,030 --> 05:03:18,550
Further.

4609
05:03:18,810 --> 05:03:18,990
Okay.

4610
05:03:19,310 --> 05:03:19,870
I'm going!

4611
05:03:20,030 --> 05:03:20,250
I'm going!

4612
05:03:22,150 --> 05:03:22,950
Oh gosh.

4613
05:03:23,030 --> 05:03:23,210
Okay.

4614
05:03:25,770 --> 05:03:28,010
He kicked me into the cutscene!

4615
05:03:34,300 --> 05:03:36,840
That's the speedrun strats right there.

4616
05:03:37,600 --> 05:03:39,080
We take those!

4617
05:03:39,180 --> 05:03:39,880
Yes we do!

4618
05:03:46,360 --> 05:03:48,200
Speedrun Tag Reels!

4619
05:03:59,260 --> 05:04:01,640
Use the little...

4620
05:04:04,840 --> 05:04:07,260
I hate...I don't like that.

4621
05:04:07,400 --> 05:04:08,300
Why did you make that...

4622
05:04:08,960 --> 05:04:10,360
Why did you make that sound?

4623
05:04:17,400 --> 05:04:18,460
Touchdown Mito!

4624
05:04:43,530 --> 05:04:45,690
This guy is the ultimate freak.

4625
05:04:45,970 --> 05:04:48,790
I don't think anyone can outmatch this freak.

4626
05:04:49,310 --> 05:04:49,890
For real.

4627
05:04:52,570 --> 05:04:55,010
He's just actually...

4628
05:04:55,010 --> 05:04:59,830
No, I...I say that, but Ocelot literally exists.

4629
05:05:01,950 --> 05:05:03,850
No, not even my freak.

4630
05:05:03,910 --> 05:05:04,510
I swear.

4631
05:05:08,510 --> 05:05:11,030
Him and Ocelot should have a freak off.

4632
05:05:14,950 --> 05:05:17,630
But he seriously is just actually a freak.

4633
05:05:26,280 --> 05:05:26,920
Oh!

4634
05:05:39,270 --> 05:05:39,910
Nasty!

4635
05:05:45,370 --> 05:05:46,930
You're scratching the metal.

4636
05:05:47,330 --> 05:05:50,010
Oh my gosh, that's JerryRig's everything when he gets a new phone.

4637
05:05:50,510 --> 05:05:53,130
You too, Immortal.

4638
05:05:54,010 --> 05:05:58,270
No, I just don't fear death.

4639
05:06:02,450 --> 05:06:06,150
Here is my actual favorite part.

4640
05:06:06,750 --> 05:06:07,590
Let them...

4641
05:06:15,460 --> 05:06:16,660
He

4642
05:06:21,480 --> 05:06:23,200
does it again!

4643
05:06:28,910 --> 05:06:33,830
It's kind of sad we didn't have a breakdancing part in Revengeance.

4644
05:06:34,010 --> 05:06:35,750
Now that I think about it.

4645
05:06:41,460 --> 05:06:42,940
So freaky.

4646
05:06:47,640 --> 05:06:48,960
The tongue!

4647
05:06:57,750 --> 05:06:58,790
Ouchie, ouch.

4648
05:07:00,150 --> 05:07:01,030
Gross!

4649
05:07:02,190 --> 05:07:03,070
Crap.

4650
05:07:10,210 --> 05:07:12,410
This pose is...what's that movie?

4651
05:07:17,750 --> 05:07:24,750
What's that movie where the lady dances and then the water splashes all over her?

4652
05:07:24,830 --> 05:07:26,770
That's what I think of every time I see that scene.

4653
05:07:32,810 --> 05:07:33,770
Uh-oh.

4654
05:07:34,230 --> 05:07:34,710
Flashdance?

4655
05:07:34,770 --> 05:07:35,270
Is that it?

4656
05:07:36,430 --> 05:07:37,370
I think so, yeah.

4657
05:07:50,690 --> 05:07:55,310
At what point does it stop being...they're trying to kill each other.

4658
05:07:55,310 --> 05:07:59,610
At what point is it like...just a sexual tension?

4659
05:08:00,690 --> 05:08:02,390
Maybe the whole time.

4660
05:08:14,250 --> 05:08:14,910
Oh my god.

4661
05:08:15,630 --> 05:08:16,630
She's so romantic!

4662
05:08:17,550 --> 05:08:18,730
Now they are one.

4663
05:08:19,570 --> 05:08:20,330
Yeah,

4664
05:08:31,880 --> 05:08:32,880
keep hugging him like that.

4665
05:08:35,340 --> 05:08:36,560
What's laughing?

4666
05:08:37,260 --> 05:08:38,240
That's too much.

4667
05:08:48,660 --> 05:08:49,600
Oh.

4668
05:08:52,770 --> 05:08:54,720
Snake cover your innocent eyes.

4669
05:08:56,600 --> 05:08:58,040
The phrasing.

4670
05:09:00,080 --> 05:09:01,700
The phrasing.

4671
05:09:02,540 --> 05:09:02,740
No!

4672
05:09:06,510 --> 05:09:07,270
He's spent.

4673
05:09:10,150 --> 05:09:11,290
What a show!

4674
05:09:12,050 --> 05:09:12,970
Again, again!

4675
05:09:20,290 --> 05:09:21,270
They got the beef.

4676
05:09:26,210 --> 05:09:33,670
Because Raiden is so different in this game, it's weird for me to think that that's the same Raiden from MGS2.

4677
05:09:34,150 --> 05:09:36,310
And all that fight, bam, the first time.

4678
05:09:37,350 --> 05:09:39,910
So that's why he's like, yeah, I know this guy and I hate him.

4679
05:09:41,290 --> 05:09:43,730
But it's hard to imagine that's the same guy.

4680
05:09:46,450 --> 05:09:47,350
Encore, baby!

4681
05:09:52,910 --> 05:09:54,130
You're not doing so well.

4682
05:09:54,330 --> 05:09:55,590
Oh my god, his nails.

4683
05:09:55,870 --> 05:10:02,070
They did not need to give him...I was about to say a French chip, but that's not what that is.

4684
05:10:05,630 --> 05:10:07,490
They did not need to give him that though.

4685
05:10:10,430 --> 05:10:11,250
They did though.

4686
05:10:22,830 --> 05:10:23,490
I love him.

4687
05:10:25,930 --> 05:10:28,770
I suffer brain damage from that fight.

4688
05:10:29,270 --> 05:10:29,810
Oh baby!

4689
05:10:32,790 --> 05:10:34,130
I'm dumb now.

4690
05:10:37,690 --> 05:10:42,050
Hey guys, I think I might be on the wrong site.

4691
05:10:42,690 --> 05:10:43,330
Oops,

4692
05:10:46,940 --> 05:10:47,940
all brain damaged.

4693
05:10:55,860 --> 05:10:56,300
Ew.

4694
05:10:57,320 --> 05:10:58,060
Oh god.

4695
05:10:58,360 --> 05:10:59,260
Oh god, Raiden.

4696
05:10:59,560 --> 05:11:00,220
Oh god, Raiden!

4697
05:11:05,400 --> 05:11:06,780
He's got to be immortal.

4698
05:11:25,540 --> 05:11:26,940
Naomi?

4699
05:11:27,860 --> 05:11:28,660
Naomi?

4700
05:11:30,140 --> 05:11:31,240
Naomi!

4701
05:11:46,040 --> 05:11:49,960
Got the Foxhound rank in Mv3!

4702
05:11:51,340 --> 05:11:53,020
Congratulations, Brian!

4703
05:11:53,020 --> 05:11:53,120
Brian!

4704
05:11:56,240 --> 05:12:00,420
Why the F were we not providing covering fire for him after we feed him?

4705
05:12:01,320 --> 05:12:02,280
That's a great question.

4706
05:12:03,620 --> 05:12:04,240
Europe.

4707
05:12:11,500 --> 05:12:12,120
Europe.

4708
05:12:20,640 --> 05:12:21,880
Oh gosh.

4709
05:12:23,780 --> 05:12:24,280
Europe.

4710
05:12:24,500 --> 05:12:25,380
Dies of cringe.

4711
05:12:31,180 --> 05:12:37,520
Wow, we got 10,000 dp for the flashback swatch.

4712
05:12:38,660 --> 05:12:40,360
Nice, nice, nice.

4713
05:12:41,620 --> 05:12:43,120
21 kills?

4714
05:12:43,680 --> 05:12:43,980
What?

4715
05:12:44,320 --> 05:12:45,440
Who did I kill?

4716
05:12:46,100 --> 05:12:47,320
Who did I kill?

4717
05:12:47,860 --> 05:12:53,400
We are at 380,000 drubbing points, everyone.

4718
05:12:55,740 --> 05:12:56,620
Shoot.

4719
05:12:56,620 --> 05:12:59,380
Could you please be more specific?

4720
05:12:59,640 --> 05:13:01,580
Raiden Europe doesn't say much.

4721
05:13:02,420 --> 05:13:05,520
Oh, from the vehicle segment.

4722
05:13:06,700 --> 05:13:09,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4723
05:13:09,880 --> 05:13:10,900
5 continues.

4724
05:13:13,460 --> 05:13:15,420
It should have been less.

4725
05:13:16,220 --> 05:13:20,100
After playing Rising Revengeance first, did you think Metal Gear could get any weirder?

4726
05:13:22,220 --> 05:13:22,960
I...

4727
05:13:24,820 --> 05:13:30,960
I understood so little of Revengeance that it's like...

4728
05:13:30,960 --> 05:13:35,340
I think, honestly, Rising is like...

4729
05:13:35,340 --> 05:13:36,960
Not even the peak weird.

4730
05:13:37,220 --> 05:13:39,160
Yeah, so it's like...

4731
05:13:39,160 --> 05:13:40,120
I don't...

4732
05:13:40,120 --> 05:13:42,480
Yeah, it definitely gets weirder.

4733
05:13:43,520 --> 05:13:45,160
That's me looking at my...

4734
05:13:45,160 --> 05:13:51,000
I have a little trading card of Raiden and his sombrero on my desk.

4735
05:13:51,920 --> 05:13:54,260
I keep it in my wallet, actually.

4736
05:13:55,860 --> 05:13:58,080
But I had it out, I don't remember why.

4737
05:13:59,300 --> 05:14:00,300
It's even sealed.

4738
05:14:05,860 --> 05:14:07,860
But, yeah, I don't know.

4739
05:14:08,360 --> 05:14:11,380
It's so funny, people reference Rising all the time.

4740
05:14:11,380 --> 05:14:14,600
But the whole core series is just so crazy and fun.

4741
05:14:16,060 --> 05:14:18,080
But Rising is a lot of fun to play.

4742
05:14:18,720 --> 05:14:20,380
When I play it again...

4743
05:14:21,360 --> 05:14:23,920
I'm gonna be honest, I'm probably gonna play it on easy mode again.

4744
05:14:24,320 --> 05:14:25,560
I don't wanna learn how to parry.

4745
05:14:27,620 --> 05:14:29,380
I don't wanna learn how to parry.

4746
05:14:30,320 --> 05:14:31,640
Save the game, yes.

4747
05:14:34,760 --> 05:14:35,560
Okay, so...

4748
05:14:46,250 --> 05:14:48,790
Maybe I do just farm in the later levels.

4749
05:14:51,690 --> 05:14:53,690
Hope you have fun, may you have a happy birthday!

4750
05:14:54,870 --> 05:14:56,510
Neo Cerberus, of course!

4751
05:14:56,750 --> 05:14:58,150
Aw, you could've interrupted.

4752
05:14:58,590 --> 05:15:00,610
It's not an interruption, it's all good.

4753
05:15:01,550 --> 05:15:04,310
Happy birthday to you!

4754
05:15:04,890 --> 05:15:07,290
Happy birthday to you!

4755
05:15:07,890 --> 05:15:10,810
Happy birthday, Neo Cerberus!

4756
05:15:13,010 --> 05:15:16,730
Happy birthday to you!

4757
05:15:17,830 --> 05:15:19,090
Happy birthday!

4758
05:15:21,970 --> 05:15:25,850
It is a little frustrating that they cost so much money, but...

4759
05:15:28,530 --> 05:15:31,390
But I guess we'll survive, I suppose.

4760
05:15:34,530 --> 05:15:36,250
We're getting through the game anyway.

4761
05:15:36,250 --> 05:15:36,310
Okay.

4762
05:15:39,930 --> 05:15:40,310
And?

4763
05:15:41,150 --> 05:15:43,450
Do we get a briefing, and then we go into Act?

4764
05:15:51,940 --> 05:15:52,320
What's...

4765
05:15:52,810 --> 05:15:54,800
Clearing the game, no kills, no spots, doing that...

4766
05:15:54,800 --> 05:15:55,780
Oh, well...

4767
05:15:55,780 --> 05:15:56,520
No spots?

4768
05:15:56,820 --> 05:15:58,880
No, that's like...

4769
05:15:58,880 --> 05:16:02,860
Clearing the game, no kills is way easier than clearing the game with spots.

4770
05:16:04,420 --> 05:16:09,260
If you had to do the trolley problem and Naomi was on one track and Huey was on the other, what would you do?

4771
05:16:38,130 --> 05:16:38,970
I'm thinking.

4772
05:16:42,110 --> 05:16:43,970
This is how I make my eggs now.

4773
05:16:44,390 --> 05:16:46,650
This is the only good Naomi has ever done for me.

4774
05:16:48,850 --> 05:16:49,130
Yeah.

4775
05:16:50,790 --> 05:16:51,990
They cook on one minute?

4776
05:16:54,490 --> 05:16:55,770
She likes cooking eggs.

4777
05:16:58,510 --> 05:17:01,690
This is my sunny-side-up fortune-telling.

4778
05:17:03,270 --> 05:17:07,170
When it turns out good, it means something good is gonna happen.

4779
05:17:07,590 --> 05:17:11,450
So that's why you don't cook them over easy.

4780
05:17:15,870 --> 05:17:16,790
One minute.

4781
05:17:24,090 --> 05:17:29,210
The secret to good cooking is to keep who's going to eat it in mind.

4782
05:17:31,090 --> 05:17:32,490
Oh...

4783
05:17:32,990 --> 05:17:33,690
Sunny!

4784
05:17:36,850 --> 05:17:38,510
Me, I'm gonna eat it.

4785
05:17:42,750 --> 05:17:44,150
Yes.

4786
05:18:08,950 --> 05:18:11,930
Protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, americium.

4787
05:18:15,250 --> 05:18:16,790
What a show-off.

4788
05:18:17,490 --> 05:18:17,750
Curium.

4789
05:18:21,470 --> 05:18:22,070
Curium.

4790
05:18:22,490 --> 05:18:24,830
Yeah, Sunny knows it.

4791
05:18:25,090 --> 05:18:27,010
You had to get help from a kid.

4792
05:18:35,520 --> 05:18:39,400
Oh, she likes the flower.

4793
05:18:46,110 --> 05:18:50,390
You did not need to step on the box for that, Naomi.

4794
05:18:50,670 --> 05:18:51,370
You know that.

4795
05:18:52,250 --> 05:18:53,290
She's half your size.

4796
05:18:59,060 --> 05:19:01,740
No, Sunny's so cute!

4797
05:19:06,980 --> 05:19:10,280
Don't teach her such a lesson at such a young age.

4798
05:19:11,880 --> 05:19:14,560
She looks beautiful no matter what she does.

4799
05:19:17,880 --> 05:19:18,200
Oh.

4800
05:19:28,220 --> 05:19:28,860
The eggs!

4801
05:19:31,060 --> 05:19:31,640
Take it off!

4802
05:19:31,880 --> 05:19:32,440
Take it off!

4803
05:19:32,540 --> 05:19:32,880
Take it off!

4804
05:19:32,940 --> 05:19:33,300
Take it off!

4805
05:19:44,700 --> 05:19:46,140
That was like 5 minutes.

4806
05:19:48,900 --> 05:19:52,900
I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING CREDIT FOR HER EGGS!

4807
05:19:53,560 --> 05:19:56,520
I CAN'T STAND YOU, NAOMI HUNTER!

4808
05:20:15,170 --> 05:20:17,030
KILL NAOMI!

4809
05:20:17,410 --> 05:20:18,610
KILL NAOMI!

4810
05:20:22,550 --> 05:20:23,730
SAVE YUI!

4811
05:20:23,870 --> 05:20:25,970
I WANT THIS BITCH DEAD!

4812
05:20:33,530 --> 05:20:37,350
If Naomi was part of 2, she would have killed Olga.

4813
05:20:37,630 --> 05:20:38,390
It's true!

4814
05:20:38,630 --> 05:20:40,010
Also, Snake!

4815
05:20:42,650 --> 05:20:43,430
What is that?

4816
05:20:46,310 --> 05:20:48,010
What is that down there?

4817
05:20:48,230 --> 05:20:49,130
Is that his PC?

4818
05:20:49,130 --> 05:20:52,270
Why do you just have a picture of Snake on your computer?

4819
05:21:00,170 --> 05:21:00,690
Well,

4820
05:21:06,630 --> 05:21:07,590
let me get closer.

4821
05:21:14,170 --> 05:21:15,470
Who are you?

4822
05:21:17,450 --> 05:21:18,890
What are you doing, Sonya?

4823
05:21:21,870 --> 05:21:24,210
Not where the food is made, Snake!

4824
05:21:24,570 --> 05:21:25,530
That's so horrible!

4825
05:21:30,710 --> 05:21:31,390
Oh, sorry.

4826
05:21:31,450 --> 05:21:32,750
I'm blocking the subtitles, I think.

4827
05:21:36,750 --> 05:21:38,950
You don't have a picture of Snake on your computer?

4828
05:21:39,170 --> 05:21:41,050
I absolutely do.

4829
05:21:42,350 --> 05:21:44,150
I have pictures of Snake everywhere.

4830
05:21:49,140 --> 05:21:51,640
GET AWAY FROM HIM!

4831
05:21:52,060 --> 05:21:52,980
GET AWAY!

4832
05:21:53,400 --> 05:21:54,700
Get away from him.

4833
05:21:55,180 --> 05:21:55,980
Get away!

4834
05:21:57,100 --> 05:22:01,380
Leave space between...

4835
05:22:05,040 --> 05:22:06,080
Hi,

4836
05:22:10,500 --> 05:22:10,540
Snake.

4837
05:22:13,260 --> 05:22:15,560
Are you okay?

4838
05:22:18,460 --> 05:22:20,340
I love when he wears this shirt.

4839
05:22:30,280 --> 05:22:33,100
He's literally my PFP.

4840
05:22:39,500 --> 05:22:42,160
Gosh, so loud in my head.

4841
05:22:45,320 --> 05:22:46,720
What?

4842
05:22:46,760 --> 05:22:48,320
Solidus is dead.

4843
05:22:49,860 --> 05:22:51,060
Solidus on the PC!

4844
05:22:54,700 --> 05:22:55,400
What?

4845
05:23:18,570 --> 05:23:19,970
What?

4846
05:23:24,190 --> 05:23:24,750
IBS?

4847
05:23:29,250 --> 05:23:30,650
IBS!

4848
05:23:34,750 --> 05:23:39,210
Damn, I'm full.

4849
05:23:43,810 --> 05:23:44,990
The IBS is real!

4850
05:23:47,530 --> 05:23:49,190
Oh, IBS.

4851
05:23:52,390 --> 05:23:53,770
Oh, Raiden!

4852
05:23:53,990 --> 05:23:54,610
Are you okay?

4853
05:23:57,930 --> 05:23:58,810
Raiden.

4854
05:23:59,530 --> 05:24:00,370
Sleeping baby.

4855
05:24:16,310 --> 05:24:18,590
Big Boss don't have the same genetic code?

4856
05:24:24,230 --> 05:24:26,390
STOP TOUCHING HIM!

4857
05:24:27,150 --> 05:24:27,630
Snake!

4858
05:24:30,010 --> 05:24:32,190
Are you going to accept this?

4859
05:24:32,670 --> 05:24:35,110
Oh my God, he turns away.

4860
05:24:35,170 --> 05:24:35,590
No!

4861
05:24:35,750 --> 05:24:36,470
My heart!

4862
05:24:46,310 --> 05:24:49,270
He has the system completely under his control.

4863
05:24:52,090 --> 05:24:53,810
He's so foul.

4864
05:24:54,310 --> 05:24:55,210
I know!

4865
05:24:58,850 --> 05:24:59,390
What?

4866
05:25:10,020 --> 05:25:13,820
Dante, what?

4867
05:25:17,000 --> 05:25:18,100
It's not possible.

4868
05:25:21,520 --> 05:25:22,760
Oh.

4869
05:25:26,520 --> 05:25:27,260
Death.

4870
05:25:44,150 --> 05:25:48,130
I got your DNA now.

4871
05:25:54,650 --> 05:25:56,050
Europe.

4872
05:26:04,780 --> 05:26:06,180
SunnyCam.

4873
05:26:35,570 --> 05:26:39,130
His voice is so scary.

4874
05:26:39,810 --> 05:26:44,980
Are you okay?

4875
05:26:46,140 --> 05:26:47,180
Are you okay?

4876
05:26:50,480 --> 05:26:53,440
Sunny is too busy hacking to care.

4877
05:26:57,100 --> 05:26:58,220
No!

4878
05:27:08,060 --> 05:27:09,180
No!

4879
05:27:09,180 --> 05:27:11,720
The Patriots!

4880
05:27:16,020 --> 05:27:18,700
Yeah, you take it Sunny.

4881
05:27:22,040 --> 05:27:22,720
No, Snake!

4882
05:27:25,840 --> 05:27:28,120
They are so cute.

4883
05:27:41,020 --> 05:27:43,920
Slicking away when Raiden's screeching was going on.

4884
05:27:44,020 --> 05:27:45,960
I thought it was you screaming rabidly at Naomi.

4885
05:27:48,720 --> 05:27:50,840
You wouldn't be wrong probably.

4886
05:27:53,280 --> 05:27:54,340
It's one or the other.

4887
05:27:55,480 --> 05:27:57,080
Gosh, is it cold in there Snake?

4888
05:27:59,080 --> 05:28:01,760
I need to get you a bra or something buddy.

4889
05:28:05,480 --> 05:28:05,920
Snake!

4890
05:28:06,880 --> 05:28:08,080
I can't stop staring.

4891
05:28:08,360 --> 05:28:10,900
The light of the computer highlights them.

4892
05:28:15,340 --> 05:28:17,120
You're gonna take all the credit for her work.

4893
05:28:18,420 --> 05:28:21,520
She did most of the work and you're gonna press two buttons.

4894
05:28:22,520 --> 05:28:25,280
Sunny doesn't know how terrible of a woman she is.

4895
05:28:26,720 --> 05:28:27,380
It's okay.

4896
05:28:31,800 --> 05:28:33,520
What do you mean?

4897
05:28:37,030 --> 05:28:38,250
Look at this.

4898
05:28:45,190 --> 05:28:48,250
His artificial blood needs dialysis.

4899
05:28:49,550 --> 05:28:51,910
We don't have the proper equipment.

4900
05:28:52,250 --> 05:28:53,030
The doctor!

4901
05:28:54,030 --> 05:28:54,750
Dialysis?

4902
05:28:55,930 --> 05:28:58,730
Getting his wounds healed is important too.

4903
05:28:59,770 --> 05:29:03,030
But at this rate, he's not gonna last that long.

4904
05:29:03,190 --> 05:29:04,430
Oh no, Raiden!

4905
05:29:04,430 --> 05:29:05,090
Dialysis.

4906
05:29:05,910 --> 05:29:08,050
Is that like what kidneys do?

4907
05:29:08,910 --> 05:29:09,450
That's right.

4908
05:29:11,190 --> 05:29:12,070
She's so smart.

4909
05:29:12,370 --> 05:29:17,830
Raiden's blood is an older type of artificial blood that was used by the military.

4910
05:29:18,910 --> 05:29:20,450
Called white blood.

4911
05:29:20,530 --> 05:29:22,310
Why did they swap out his blood?

4912
05:29:22,350 --> 05:29:25,810
After it's been in use for a while, the blood needs to be dialyzed.

4913
05:29:26,730 --> 05:29:28,610
When did this happen?

4914
05:29:29,090 --> 05:29:31,170
That they just switched out his blood?

4915
05:29:31,210 --> 05:29:34,130
Right now, he's slipping into autotoxemia.

4916
05:29:34,390 --> 05:29:34,850
No!

4917
05:29:35,190 --> 05:29:35,730
Raiden!

4918
05:29:36,310 --> 05:29:37,550
Look at her big ol' eyes.

4919
05:29:42,630 --> 05:29:43,510
Since 2?

4920
05:29:48,870 --> 05:29:50,190
Cyborg blood is cool, eh?

4921
05:29:53,990 --> 05:29:56,290
Raiden, have you ever looked at a map?

4922
05:29:56,790 --> 05:29:58,170
Do you know how big Europe is?

4923
05:30:10,070 --> 05:30:12,870
Dr. Madnar!

4924
05:30:12,870 --> 05:30:15,870
He saved my life.

4925
05:30:26,510 --> 05:30:27,730
Dr. Madnar.

4926
05:30:27,990 --> 05:30:28,890
I've heard of him.

4927
05:30:29,830 --> 05:30:32,050
A world-renowned cybernetics expert.

4928
05:30:32,810 --> 05:30:34,110
Strictly underground though.

4929
05:30:34,370 --> 05:30:35,170
We're in luck then.

4930
05:30:36,770 --> 05:30:37,530
It's settled.

4931
05:30:38,090 --> 05:30:39,630
We must head for Europe.

4932
05:30:41,170 --> 05:30:43,050
The sooner we get there, the better.

4933
05:30:45,870 --> 05:30:48,530
I'll call Campbell and have him get us landing clearance.

4934
05:30:55,570 --> 05:30:57,130
It hurts.

4935
05:30:57,910 --> 05:30:58,830
It physically hurts.

4936
05:31:10,410 --> 05:31:12,770
This is a no-smoking flight.

4937
05:31:12,930 --> 05:31:14,030
Hurts my soul.

4938
05:31:17,530 --> 05:31:19,490
My chest gets tight.

4939
05:31:27,080 --> 05:31:29,000
Who's piloting this thing?

4940
05:31:31,120 --> 05:31:33,140
Who's driving this ship?

4941
05:31:37,280 --> 05:31:39,320
Look at how she plays with her feelings.

4942
05:31:39,440 --> 05:31:40,820
She's like a skinship.

4943
05:31:42,000 --> 05:31:42,520
What?

4944
05:31:49,060 --> 05:32:00,110
Why do you guys have all your pictures of your dead relatives on the computer?

4945
05:32:01,310 --> 05:32:02,410
What is going on?

4946
05:32:12,400 --> 05:32:14,020
What highlighter does she use?

4947
05:32:14,100 --> 05:32:14,620
It looks nice.

4948
05:32:14,620 --> 05:32:14,820
It's nice.

4949
05:32:19,520 --> 05:32:21,960
I hate

4950
05:32:34,370 --> 05:32:37,730
this part.

4951
05:32:50,120 --> 05:32:52,450
Don't act so kind to her.

4952
05:33:09,760 --> 05:33:11,800
You don't know anything about him!

4953
05:33:26,480 --> 05:33:28,620
I feel like I'm about to crash out.

4954
05:33:28,700 --> 05:33:29,720
I don't want to watch this.

4955
05:33:30,580 --> 05:33:32,320
I don't want to watch this anymore!

4956
05:33:35,160 --> 05:33:36,360
Leave him alone!

4957
05:33:39,720 --> 05:33:40,400
What?

4958
05:33:44,680 --> 05:33:45,900
Crash out is real.

4959
05:33:48,160 --> 05:33:50,720
In the books he says...

4960
05:33:50,720 --> 05:33:52,980
In the books...

4961
05:33:53,760 --> 05:33:56,980
In the books he says, in her monologue he says...

4962
05:33:57,580 --> 05:34:01,120
I only said that to seem cool, but I'm still an otaku.

4963
05:34:01,460 --> 05:34:03,060
He's still an otaku!

4964
05:34:04,600 --> 05:34:06,960
Otakai don't betray us!

4965
05:34:09,760 --> 05:34:10,140
No!

4966
05:34:31,760 --> 05:34:33,960
Isn't this heading home for you?

4967
05:34:34,420 --> 05:34:35,400
Naomi a little bit?

4968
05:34:40,660 --> 05:34:41,100
Really?

4969
05:34:43,620 --> 05:34:44,860
Sunny helped build this?

4970
05:34:53,800 --> 05:34:56,600
So in the end she did influence a death in two.

4971
05:34:57,880 --> 05:34:58,380
Wait, who?

4972
05:34:59,800 --> 05:35:02,160
Did you not see how smart she was earlier?

4973
05:35:15,140 --> 05:35:16,180
I'm going...

4974
05:35:16,180 --> 05:35:20,780
You don't even like Sunny!

4975
05:35:21,560 --> 05:35:24,300
You are faking liking her!

4976
05:35:28,340 --> 05:35:30,160
I need to walk away for a second.

4977
05:35:31,660 --> 05:35:32,820
I need to leave!

4978
05:35:33,420 --> 05:35:34,160
I need to leave.

4979
05:35:35,500 --> 05:35:36,940
I need to leave for a second.

4980
05:35:42,880 --> 05:35:44,600
She's always in there.

4981
05:35:45,300 --> 05:35:46,640
Searching for herself.

4982
05:35:47,900 --> 05:35:49,240
Searching for her family.

4983
05:35:51,820 --> 05:35:56,340
She's trying to find out who she is and where she's going.

4984
05:35:56,960 --> 05:35:58,000
I need to get back.

4985
05:36:00,380 --> 05:36:03,320
Searching for herself and her family.

4986
05:36:04,460 --> 05:36:08,800
She believes she can find the answers inside a machine hooked up to the world.

4987
05:36:09,720 --> 05:36:13,040
She spends every day inside the net exploring.

4988
05:36:14,120 --> 05:36:17,540
For Sunny, this is home.

4989
05:36:18,280 --> 05:36:20,660
No, it shouldn't be like that.

4990
05:36:20,900 --> 05:36:21,140
What?

4991
05:36:22,120 --> 05:36:24,500
It's time you let her go outside.

4992
05:36:25,580 --> 05:36:27,300
What are you talking about?

4993
05:36:28,580 --> 05:36:30,780
She hasn't even been born yet.

4994
05:36:30,820 --> 05:36:32,300
She's still a fetus.

4995
05:36:32,720 --> 05:36:33,900
She's still in the womb.

4996
05:36:33,900 --> 05:36:35,040
Oh my god.

4997
05:36:36,600 --> 05:36:38,460
She needs to live a real life.

4998
05:36:40,140 --> 05:36:43,800
But Sunny's never shown any interest in leaving the Nomad.

4999
05:36:46,100 --> 05:36:47,840
Frankly, I'm worried about all your gold.

5000
05:36:47,840 --> 05:36:50,980
Okay, this is the only thing I actually agree with.

5001
05:36:52,220 --> 05:36:53,900
With Naomi on...

5002
05:36:54,900 --> 05:36:55,780
The Otacon.

5003
05:36:55,900 --> 05:36:56,880
She's never shown interest.

5004
05:36:57,000 --> 05:36:58,000
Yeah, she doesn't...

5005
05:36:58,000 --> 05:36:59,780
She doesn't know anything else.

5006
05:37:01,240 --> 05:37:02,980
Give me something to break.

5007
05:37:02,980 --> 05:37:05,080
How about Naomi's face?

5008
05:37:06,140 --> 05:37:07,920
No, I refuse, Grass.

5009
05:37:33,500 --> 05:37:35,300
She's being so sussy.

5010
05:37:40,960 --> 05:37:44,580
Has Sunny never had a meal outside of eggs?

5011
05:37:45,800 --> 05:37:47,660
Has she ever had anything?

5012
05:38:21,030 --> 05:38:23,490
Is it okay to sleep in there?

5013
05:38:25,230 --> 05:38:26,350
Excuse me?

5014
05:38:26,910 --> 05:38:30,430
Well, Dr. Emmerich...

5015
05:38:33,630 --> 05:38:39,190
I know it's easy to forget sometimes, but I am a woman.

5016
05:38:40,790 --> 05:38:42,050
You understand.

5017
05:38:43,870 --> 05:38:44,510
Sorry.

5018
05:38:45,370 --> 05:38:49,750
I know it's selfish of me, but...

5019
05:38:50,550 --> 05:38:52,950
Sorry, the way he's covering his face.

5020
05:38:55,550 --> 05:38:56,330
I understand.

5021
05:38:57,190 --> 05:38:58,910
The way he's like...

5022
05:39:01,670 --> 05:39:03,650
Oh my goodness.

5023
05:39:18,190 --> 05:39:21,390
I need Naomi to ruin my life.

5024
05:39:22,190 --> 05:39:23,850
Liquid, solid.

5025
05:39:28,940 --> 05:39:30,840
I physically can't watch this, you guys.

5026
05:39:30,900 --> 05:39:31,380
I'm sorry.

5027
05:39:31,560 --> 05:39:32,040
I'm sorry.

5028
05:39:32,040 --> 05:39:33,380
I need to go.

5029
05:39:34,580 --> 05:39:36,960
I can't do this again!

5030
05:40:15,790 --> 05:40:17,630
Call me Hal.

5031
05:40:21,680 --> 05:40:22,640
Good night.

5032
05:40:25,300 --> 05:40:26,560
Good night, Hal.

5033
05:40:27,460 --> 05:40:27,980
Shut that door.

5034
05:40:28,620 --> 05:40:29,340
Lock it.

5035
05:40:30,200 --> 05:40:31,380
Open the door!

5036
05:40:31,560 --> 05:40:32,200
Open the hatch!

5037
05:40:32,640 --> 05:40:33,880
Push the plane out!

5038
05:40:33,960 --> 05:40:34,800
The helicopter out!

5039
05:41:03,890 --> 05:41:06,070
I actually shivered just now.

5040
05:41:10,160 --> 05:41:17,080
We're stronger now that we have gotten past the worst part of the game.

5041
05:41:17,980 --> 05:41:20,900
We are stronger individuals now.

5042
05:41:23,580 --> 05:41:26,200
We don't have to do it again.

5043
05:41:28,600 --> 05:41:33,120
But for those who have not seen that cutscene...

5044
05:41:33,120 --> 05:41:35,060
You had to see it.

5045
05:41:36,380 --> 05:41:41,880
You have to know how terrible of a person Naomi Hunter is.

5046
05:41:41,980 --> 05:41:51,860
I didn't understand why you hated her this much, but now I get it.

5047
05:41:51,980 --> 05:41:52,880
No, no, no.

5048
05:41:53,520 --> 05:41:53,880
You don't...

5049
05:41:55,500 --> 05:41:58,340
You don't even understand!

5050
05:41:59,940 --> 05:42:01,800
It gets worse!

5051
05:42:01,800 --> 05:42:02,260
It gets worse!

5052
05:42:06,000 --> 05:42:06,640
Hi.

5053
05:42:08,560 --> 05:42:15,560
I wish I could go back in time and tell him to cut this character out of my afterlife!

5054
05:42:17,160 --> 05:42:22,280
Hottake, you should be hoping that Hal falls in love with Naomi given the established pattern with his love interests.

5055
05:42:24,640 --> 05:42:26,560
Yes, but also...

5056
05:42:28,140 --> 05:42:32,120
I don't want Otacon to have his little heart broken!

5057
05:42:32,880 --> 05:42:37,720
I don't want Otacon to be a sad guy!

5058
05:42:39,200 --> 05:42:41,240
Naomi is Gray Fox's fault.

5059
05:42:41,580 --> 05:42:42,780
You are right!

5060
05:42:42,780 --> 05:42:43,340
You are right!

5061
05:42:43,780 --> 05:42:45,340
We need to go back in time.

5062
05:42:46,120 --> 05:42:52,320
We need to go back in time!

5063
05:42:52,920 --> 05:42:54,240
We need to tell...

5064
05:42:54,920 --> 05:42:57,240
We need to actually...

5065
05:42:57,940 --> 05:42:59,320
When Gray Fox...

5066
05:42:59,980 --> 05:43:04,240
After we fist fought Gray Fox in the minefield...

5067
05:43:05,040 --> 05:43:07,240
I say field, in the mine room...

5068
05:43:09,020 --> 05:43:10,920
Was that before or after?

5069
05:43:12,700 --> 05:43:14,460
Was that before or after?

5070
05:43:14,960 --> 05:43:17,320
Because I think we really need to finish the job there!

5071
05:43:18,560 --> 05:43:20,820
Is Naomi worse than Strangelove though?

5072
05:43:20,940 --> 05:43:21,360
Yes!

5073
05:43:21,880 --> 05:43:22,480
Million!

5074
05:43:22,860 --> 05:43:23,860
I love Strangelove.

5075
05:43:23,920 --> 05:43:26,520
Sorry, this is a strange... I actually really like her.

5076
05:43:31,790 --> 05:43:34,010
He already had Naomi.

5077
05:43:37,470 --> 05:43:39,950
We need to go back in time.

5078
05:43:41,830 --> 05:43:43,190
Even further!

5079
05:43:43,810 --> 05:43:45,670
We need to go back in time even further!

5080
05:43:47,190 --> 05:43:51,030
We need to make Gray Fox never join the military.

5081
05:43:54,290 --> 05:43:55,650
We need...

5082
05:43:57,170 --> 05:44:00,230
We need to make sure he just never...

5083
05:44:02,930 --> 05:44:05,370
He never steps foot in that office!

5084
05:44:06,030 --> 05:44:07,450
He never enlists!

5085
05:44:07,570 --> 05:44:08,750
He never does anything!

5086
05:44:10,910 --> 05:44:12,190
And then...

5087
05:44:12,190 --> 05:44:14,390
Then we'll... wait...

5088
05:44:14,390 --> 05:44:16,610
Who will kill... ok, wait...

5089
05:44:16,610 --> 05:44:20,450
Actually, we need to tell Gray Fox to finish the job!

5090
05:44:20,810 --> 05:44:21,890
This is his fault!

5091
05:44:22,290 --> 05:44:25,510
He killed her family but he didn't finish the job!

5092
05:44:26,650 --> 05:44:28,510
This is all Gray Fox's fault!

5093
05:44:44,330 --> 05:44:45,290
We need...

5094
05:44:52,550 --> 05:44:54,050
Wait, not a new save!

5095
05:44:55,690 --> 05:44:58,290
This begs the question, who's worse, Naomi or Huey?

5096
05:44:59,010 --> 05:45:02,930
Naomi for my personal bias, but honestly, I think Huey's way worse.

5097
05:45:04,390 --> 05:45:08,970
Naomi's worse in my personal bias, but she also did cause like a...

5098
05:45:08,970 --> 05:45:12,990
She's just... she caused a whole lot of drama and...

5099
05:45:14,130 --> 05:45:17,950
She just caused... she's like the Black Plague of this world.

5100
05:45:19,990 --> 05:45:22,450
She caused so much...

5101
05:45:22,450 --> 05:45:24,330
Just because she was like...

5102
05:45:24,330 --> 05:45:26,930
You killed my brother!

5103
05:45:27,670 --> 05:45:29,210
You killed my brother!

5104
05:45:30,010 --> 05:45:31,770
I can't believe you killed my brother!

5105
05:45:32,630 --> 05:45:35,670
I'm Naomi with my accent and you killed my brother!

5106
05:45:36,390 --> 05:45:36,990
And then...

5107
05:45:38,550 --> 05:45:39,230
And

5108
05:45:43,280 --> 05:45:43,960
then...

5109
05:45:45,180 --> 05:45:46,220
She's like...

5110
05:45:46,220 --> 05:45:47,360
She's like...

5111
05:45:48,140 --> 05:45:51,960
She should be so far removed from the whole Patriots...

5112
05:45:53,220 --> 05:45:54,500
Everything situation, but no!

5113
05:45:54,580 --> 05:45:57,480
She just gotta get her little stinking nose in there.

5114
05:45:57,540 --> 05:45:58,600
She's gotta get her little nose.

5115
05:45:58,760 --> 05:46:01,160
She's gotta bury it deep in the shit.

5116
05:46:01,260 --> 05:46:06,040
She's just gotta be in everyone's business and then she takes the credit for everything!

5117
05:46:06,400 --> 05:46:11,640
She takes the credit for everything after sticking her nose into where it does not belong!

5118
05:46:11,900 --> 05:46:12,840
I swear!

5119
05:46:18,530 --> 05:46:24,430
She... just cut her out of the equation and it would solve so many problems!

5120
05:46:26,390 --> 05:46:27,630
End scene.

5121
05:46:32,440 --> 05:46:33,120
Anyway...

5122
05:46:42,380 --> 05:46:44,540
So you're saying you don't like her then?

5123
05:46:47,760 --> 05:46:50,940
Right here is the passion I started watching you.

5124
05:46:51,140 --> 05:46:54,140
I hope this has been cathartic for you.

5125
05:46:54,660 --> 05:46:59,460
I'm a person that when I get angry I cry.

5126
05:47:07,330 --> 05:47:09,250
Act 3!

5127
05:47:15,010 --> 05:47:17,810
In conclusion, still good.

5128
05:47:21,990 --> 05:47:23,850
Don't... stick it in crazy.

5129
05:47:23,990 --> 05:47:24,890
Everybody says that.

5130
05:47:25,610 --> 05:47:31,110
We're gonna skip this cutscene because I need to get to the title menu.

5131
05:47:31,550 --> 05:47:32,570
Skip, skip, skip!

5132
05:47:32,630 --> 05:47:33,310
We're not continuing.

5133
05:47:34,070 --> 05:47:36,310
I gotta get to the title menu.

5134
05:47:40,970 --> 05:47:42,790
But I can fix her.

5135
05:47:42,970 --> 05:47:43,870
You actually can't!

5136
05:47:45,910 --> 05:47:47,030
You actually...

5137
05:47:47,950 --> 05:47:48,510
can't!

5138
05:47:49,670 --> 05:47:50,790
Like you...

5139
05:47:51,550 --> 05:47:52,110
really...

5140
05:47:52,110 --> 05:47:54,710
You really cannot.

5141
05:47:55,270 --> 05:47:56,170
Oh my gosh!

5142
05:47:56,450 --> 05:47:58,890
Who is this handsome devil right here?

5143
05:48:00,910 --> 05:48:02,810
Can we have a poll on wood or wooden?

5144
05:48:03,010 --> 05:48:04,290
Absolutely not.

5145
05:48:06,650 --> 05:48:07,510
You okay now Mint?

5146
05:48:07,730 --> 05:48:08,910
If not, here's ice cream.

5147
05:48:09,330 --> 05:48:11,130
Thank you!

5148
05:48:13,530 --> 05:48:14,430
Fixing Naomi?

5149
05:48:14,630 --> 05:48:15,470
Level impossible.

5150
05:48:18,570 --> 05:48:23,250
Act 2 really just gets my blood boiling.

5151
05:48:26,810 --> 05:48:30,530
But Act 3 is a lore dump and a half.

5152
05:48:32,630 --> 05:48:35,570
Strap in for next time.

5153
05:48:48,400 --> 05:48:50,020
Lots of lore and craziness.

5154
05:48:52,600 --> 05:48:55,160
We get to learn a lot and get a lot of answers.

5155
05:48:55,160 --> 05:48:58,900
Thank you Fujo Crashout is why we love watching you never change.

5156
05:49:00,300 --> 05:49:02,660
I have the most feelings.

5157
05:49:04,140 --> 05:49:04,760
That's a lie.

5158
05:49:05,380 --> 05:49:09,160
If you think I have a lot of opinions, a lot of feelings about Naomi...

5159
05:49:11,700 --> 05:49:16,160
Maybe quadruple that and those are the feelings I have for Snake and Ocelot.

5160
05:49:17,800 --> 05:49:19,760
Thanks for the five gifted!

5161
05:49:21,020 --> 05:49:25,940
All I have to do is think about Snake and Ocelot and I'm immediately put into tears.

5162
05:49:33,610 --> 05:49:34,570
Only quadruple?

5163
05:49:35,570 --> 05:49:36,750
Well that's like the minimum.

5164
05:49:39,330 --> 05:49:40,450
It's like the minimum.

5165
05:49:42,970 --> 05:49:44,310
I love this song.

5166
05:49:44,610 --> 05:49:46,050
This title screen is so...

5167
05:49:48,050 --> 05:49:49,830
It really just has a lot of...

5168
05:49:49,830 --> 05:49:50,870
It really sets the tone.

5169
05:49:51,010 --> 05:49:52,310
It has so much emotion in it.

5170
05:49:57,610 --> 05:49:58,730
It's so good.

5171
05:50:01,330 --> 05:50:02,410
It's so good.

5172
05:50:03,770 --> 05:50:04,950
It's so good.

5173
05:50:05,070 --> 05:50:05,930
It's a core memory.

5174
05:50:06,050 --> 05:50:06,690
For me too.

5175
05:50:07,090 --> 05:50:08,950
Like I just hear this song and I'm like...

5176
05:50:10,250 --> 05:50:11,090
I just feel...

5177
05:50:12,090 --> 05:50:14,330
This game makes me feel everything.

5178
05:50:17,710 --> 05:50:18,890
I love this game.

5179
05:50:19,210 --> 05:50:21,150
I know it has so many criticisms.

5180
05:50:21,150 --> 05:50:22,610
And they're all valid.

5181
05:50:22,790 --> 05:50:23,450
Well, not all.

5182
05:50:23,750 --> 05:50:25,150
A lot of them are valid but...

5183
05:50:26,270 --> 05:50:28,250
Watch again next time on Myth Phantom Channel.

5184
05:50:29,070 --> 05:50:29,710
I just woke up.

5185
05:50:29,790 --> 05:50:30,790
Good morning, Nita!

5186
05:50:35,090 --> 05:50:39,250
It has its criticisms but I just...

5187
05:50:39,250 --> 05:50:40,870
I can't not love it.

5188
05:50:40,970 --> 05:50:41,410
I don't know.

5189
05:50:41,950 --> 05:50:42,930
I think it's such a good ending.

5190
05:50:43,290 --> 05:50:43,730
Snake!

5191
05:50:44,490 --> 05:50:47,690
Oh my god, the title screen!

5192
05:50:47,690 --> 05:50:51,950
This was a very entertaining stream.

5193
05:50:52,090 --> 05:50:53,450
I loved all the Naomi hate tonight.

5194
05:50:53,550 --> 05:50:55,930
I hope you have a good rest of your evening, YouTube Ireland!

5195
05:51:04,610 --> 05:51:06,630
Thank you guys for...

5196
05:51:07,350 --> 05:51:08,010
Act 2.

5197
05:51:08,610 --> 05:51:10,510
I'm gonna go eat some dinner.

5198
05:51:11,870 --> 05:51:12,290
And yeah.

5199
05:51:12,970 --> 05:51:13,570
Otsuminto!

5200
05:51:14,570 --> 05:51:15,950
Thank you guys.

5201
05:51:17,090 --> 05:51:18,290
Act 3.

5202
05:51:18,290 --> 05:51:21,910
I don't know if Act 3 will be Saturday or Sunday next weekend.

5203
05:51:24,050 --> 05:51:25,950
I'm trying to finalize some plans that I have.

5204
05:51:29,030 --> 05:51:29,510
But...

5205
05:51:30,190 --> 05:51:31,730
One of those...

5206
05:51:31,730 --> 05:51:33,490
One day.

5207
05:51:33,770 --> 05:51:34,550
It will be a day.

5208
05:51:38,370 --> 05:51:39,430
Salty0, thank you!

5209
05:51:40,570 --> 05:51:41,830
Thanks for the pink!

5210
05:51:43,730 --> 05:51:44,590
I had so much fun.

5211
05:51:44,650 --> 05:51:46,290
I love watching you play the MGS series.

5212
05:51:46,450 --> 05:51:47,210
Thank you!

5213
05:51:47,210 --> 05:51:49,450
And we got...

5214
05:51:49,450 --> 05:51:51,260
We got our second statue, so...

5215
05:51:52,630 --> 05:51:53,710
We're killing it, baby!

5216
05:51:54,490 --> 05:51:56,090
We'll get that solar gun.

5217
05:51:56,710 --> 05:51:58,300
And then we'll go outside and we'll go...

5218
05:51:59,050 --> 05:51:59,430
Solar!

5219
05:52:02,930 --> 05:52:04,770
Okay, farming stream.

5220
05:52:05,010 --> 05:52:07,610
Probably more towards the end we can do a farming stream.

5221
05:52:07,950 --> 05:52:09,210
I probably will do like a members...

5222
05:52:11,930 --> 05:52:12,470
Farming...

5223
05:52:12,470 --> 05:52:13,630
Something, something.

5224
05:52:13,910 --> 05:52:14,630
Yeah, sunlight!

5225
05:52:16,530 --> 05:52:17,930
That's what it is, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5226
05:52:20,850 --> 05:52:24,790
Don't forget to look up the extra passwords later too.

5227
05:52:25,010 --> 05:52:26,450
Yeah, I should, I should, I should.

5228
05:52:27,530 --> 05:52:28,230
Comment that.

5229
05:52:28,450 --> 05:52:28,710
Comment.

5230
05:52:29,030 --> 05:52:30,070
Put it in the comments.

5231
05:52:30,690 --> 05:52:32,210
Chiquito, so I don't forget, please.

5232
05:52:34,430 --> 05:52:34,750
Okay.

5233
05:52:36,110 --> 05:52:37,070
Otsumito, everybody!

5234
05:52:38,450 --> 05:52:39,330
Otsumito, Otsumito!

5235
05:52:40,410 --> 05:52:42,410
And I'll see you guys...

5236
05:52:42,410 --> 05:52:43,170
Next time!

5237
05:52:44,610 --> 05:52:45,370
Thank you!

5238
05:52:45,370 --> 05:52:46,290
Thanks for watching!

5239
05:52:47,130 --> 05:52:47,930
Bye-bye!

5240
05:52:47,990 --> 05:52:48,350
Bye-bye!

5241
05:52:48,410 --> 05:52:48,690
Bye-bye!

5242
05:52:48,770 --> 05:52:49,030
Bye-bye!

5243

Bye-bye!
