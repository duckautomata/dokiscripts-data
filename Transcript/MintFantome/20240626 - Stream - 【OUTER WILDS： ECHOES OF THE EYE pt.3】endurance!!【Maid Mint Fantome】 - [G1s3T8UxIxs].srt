1
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
I'm really stupid.

2
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,280
Welcome back to Ultra Wild's Echoes of the Eye.

3
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,900
You guys, my brain is so small!

4
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,820
Oh no!

5
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,340
Oh no!

6
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,420
The illustration is too dang cute.

7
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,240
I thought so too.

8
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm back.

9
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,280
Why do you say that?

10
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,980
Because I've been thinking...

11
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,140
Okay, I'll be honest.

12
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,440
I haven't been thinking about it all week.

13
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,440
But I've been thinking pretty consistently like...

14
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,900
How do I solve this?

15
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Next puzzle...

16
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
I have no idea!

17
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
I don't know!

18
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,900
So...

19
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,900
We're getting endurance today.

20
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
Let's see how far we can get.

21
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,420
Hopefully finish.

22
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:15,920
We'll see.

23
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
As long as my brain is...

24
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,380
Capable.

25
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,420
Probably.

26
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,000
Does Mint have the ability to think?

27
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,280
Maybe with help from the Baxators?

28
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,460
Yeah, but you guys will probably say no Elp.

29
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,300
You guys will probably say no Elp!

30
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,340
Oh my goodness, my voice is a little hoarse.

31
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,860
That's an elephant.

32
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,340
I was supposed to...

33
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Record the podcast.

34
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,320
Usually stuff like that will help warm up my voice.

35
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,740
Omatara overslept because she's not feeling well.

36
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,380
No Elp.

37
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,960
Please, just a little Elp.

38
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,940
Just a little, little Elp.

39
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,340
Please.

40
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,000
A little Elp.

41
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,880
Yippee!

42
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,660
Okay, let's just get started.

43
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Because we can...

44
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,580
Go over some stuff that...

45
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,040
That...

46
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,960
The...

47
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,260
Stuff from last...

48
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,940
Week.

49
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,780
Why am I lagging?

50
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,040
Okay, I think I'm okay.

51
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,850
No Elf?

52
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,350
No Elf.

53
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,390
Just Elp.

54
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,990
Just a little bit of Elp.

55
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,930
Like, tiny bit.

56
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,470
Okay.

57
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,550
So we're here at the Stranger for our little recap.

58
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,350
It's been...

59
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,690
It's been a week.

60
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,030
So the Stranger is this ring world hidden with a cloaking field.

61
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,970
It's also like trying to get away from the sun.

62
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,810
I think that they know something bad's gonna happen.

63
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,310
And it's not Hearthian or Nomayan.

64
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,270
It's scary.

65
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,850
That's all that it is.

66
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,230
We have the reservoir.

67
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,770
There's more to explore here.

68
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,290
We...

69
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,990
We got inside the house eventually.

70
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,730
Wait.

71
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,750
Is it the...

72
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,710
Wait.

73
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,270
More to explore here.

74
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,770
Enjoy your artist giving you buffs.

75
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,770
I know, right?

76
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,690
Feels like you're rubbing it in Doki's face.

77
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,530
You know.

78
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,310
It's all an illusion.

79
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,790
Basically.

80
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,190
You know.

81
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,070
Attractive.

82
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,850
A trick of the eye.

83
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,210
A ghostly apparition.

84
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,810
A ghost trick if you will.

85
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,350
I don't know what jumbly dumblies means, Archer.

86
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,710
But I think it's pretty apt to this.

87
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,230
I think.

88
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,450
She shifted the ectoplasm around.

89
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,450
There's the house with the projector and the reservoir.

90
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,290
You didn't use it.

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,660
There it is.

92
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:32,920
We're back.

93
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,760
Okay.

94
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,180
Huh?

95
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,920
I found a projection showing the stranger's current trajectory and the sun's predicted supernova rate.

96
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,220
It's in the summary.

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:49,980
Oh my gosh.

98
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,520
I can't read the summary.

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,260
I'm feeling summary FOMO.

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,400
AI summary FOMO.

101
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,360
Okay.

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,300
This thing is what I was thinking of.

103
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,720
The sum...

104
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:58,980
Wait.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Hold on.

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,880
What does this say?

107
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,300
I found a diagram of a hollow metal structure suspended by chains.

108
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,640
There is a round hole underneath that appears to be only one end...

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:06,960
Only...

110
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,720
The only entrance.

111
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,080
Yeah.

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,480
And it's this sealed vault that takes us to the lake.

113
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,980
And we're trying to unlock it.

114
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,300
Maybe?

115
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,420
I guess so.

116
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,240
Poor doki board.

117
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,220
Do...

118
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,860
Do...

119
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,500
Do...

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,700
Doki board?

121
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,170
Holy moly.

122
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:40,490
Holy moly.

123
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:40,610
Holy moly.

124
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,530
That is so good.

125
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,270
Did you come up with that yourself?

126
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,950
Oh.

127
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,770
Wow.

128
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,290
I'm missing context.

129
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,450
Why is doki bird aboard?

130
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,670
Because she's flat.

131
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,470
That's...

132
00:08:59,470 --> 00:08:59,970
That's all.

133
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,010
That's all.

134
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,210
You know.

135
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,890
Okay.

136
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,470
Let's see.

137
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,190
The sealed vault.

138
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,610
Which is...

139
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,610
The...

140
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:10,850
These things.

141
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,230
And then the things that show how to make it appear and disappear.

142
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,970
You just go to those things and they'll light it up, baby.

143
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:21,630
And then...

144
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,930
I guess we gotta go to them and blow them out?

145
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:24,910
Maybe?

146
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,670
We'll see.

147
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,950
What's this?

148
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,330
Side reel.

149
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:28,850
Yeah.

150
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,230
Okay.

151
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,750
River...

152
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:30,990
Okay.

153
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,270
Hold on.

154
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,430
Which one is the...

155
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,690
The...

156
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,010
Okay.

157
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,850
This is the reservoir.

158
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,150
Okay.

159
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,690
We're gonna go back there since there's more to explore.

160
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,810
River lowlands.

161
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,890
This stinking tower is the bane of my existence right now.

162
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,190
I found a side...

163
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,290
No.

164
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,530
Not the secret passage.

165
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,330
It's this one.

166
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,510
This...

167
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:57,970
This...

168
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,390
This...

169
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,790
This...

170
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,230
This...

171
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,150
This...

172
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,450
This...

173
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,710
This...

174
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,010
This...

175
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,050
This...

176
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,210
This...

177
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,510
This...

178
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,370
This...

179
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,610
This has been haunting me.

180
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,610
The ghost is being haunted.

181
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,710
This has been haunting me for...

182
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,110
For...

183
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,070
For a week?

184
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,710
Two.

185
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,570
Two.

186
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,050
Thank you.

187
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:17,730
Wait.

188
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,070
Hold on.

189
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,570
Sorry.

190
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,430
I just realized.

191
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,790
I cannot read.

192
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,190
Oh.

193
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,150
I meant I'm ashamed for missing first two streams.

194
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,470
What?

195
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,170
Don't even be worried about that.

196
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,590
But thank you, Samu.

197
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,290
Thank you.

198
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,730
I just watched the VOD.

199
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,350
So let's go with this knife and knife.

200
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:33,870
Mary, love you.

201
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,010
Bye.

202
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,430
Thank you so much.

203
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,070
This game expands your brain big time.

204
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,810
I...

205
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,150
Oh, gosh.

206
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,350
It's this puzzle that's really making me...

207
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,830
Making me scratch my head a lot.

208
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,790
Oh.

209
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,490
So that is what we're gonna...

210
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,910
I mean, we're gonna focus on everything because we're trying to...

211
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,610
Cliffside building.

212
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,670
We haven't been here yet either.

213
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,270
We haven't been able to go because the bridge...

214
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,230
It rotted away.

215
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,650
Hidden Gorge.

216
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,170
But there's nothing else.

217
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,270
I guess this is the only...

218
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,450
Wait.

219
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,510
Yeah.

220
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,910
This is the only place that still has stuff to explore.

221
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,930
So let's go there.

222
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,390
Before we...

223
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:18,790
Oh, wait.

224
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,210
And obviously in the unknown.

225
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,810
In the unknown places.

226
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,330
There's stuff to explore.

227
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,870
Which I really don't want to.

228
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,350
But, you know.

229
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,990
Oh.

230
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,770
Oh.

231
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,350
Oh.

232
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,610
But we still have a place that we can go to that is safe.

233
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,430
Good luck!

234
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,230
Thank you!

235
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,510
I just realized...

236
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,770
Where's the map?

237
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,710
Here.

238
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,770
Yes.

239
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,050
Wait.

240
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,410
Where is it?

241
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,510
Wait.

242
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,250
I locked onto it.

243
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:03,350
It didn't work.

244
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,770
Why did it get locked?

245
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,570
Wait.

246
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,510
Oh, wait.

247
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:05,890
Wait.

248
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,370
I'm getting out.

249
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,730
I'm going over here.

250
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,910
Gopar!

251
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,690
Thank you for the 50gift!

252
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,250
Thank you!

253
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,330
Oh my gosh!

254
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,190
Thank you so much!

255
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:13,930
Thank you!

256
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:19,890
Oh, stranger.

257
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,710
You guys spoil me.

258
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm coming in!

259
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,800
Oh!

260
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,060
Hot... maybe.

261
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm not locked onto it, what do you mean?

262
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,480
Wait, what happened?

263
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,120
Oh, I forgot to lock onto it!

264
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,360
Who's on the thumbnail?

265
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,360
What do you mean,

266
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,990
who's on the thumbnail?

267
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,890
What do you mean by that?

268
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,910
Is it so unbelievable?

269
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,310
Is it so unbelievable that that could not be me on the thumbnail?

270
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,490
It's called artistic liberties.

271
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,370
Everybody.

272
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,660
It's called artistic liberty.

273
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,420
Also, Ducky, thanks for the five...

274
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,180
Okay, we already wasted some time.

275
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,760
That's okay.

276
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,080
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

277
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,140
Coming in hot again.

278
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

279
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,200
Oh, I don't want to run into the chandelier.

280
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,320
We're gonna roll?

281
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,460
This is a foolproof plan.

282
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,660
You roll and then that's it.

283
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,660
It's the easiest thing ever.

284
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,660
To the reservoir.

285
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,560
Another masterful somersault landing.

286
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,700
Thank you.

287
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,320
Goodness.

288
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
I'm already getting nervous.

289
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,660
I'm already nervous.

290
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,100
Wait.

291
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,760
Oh, we're here.

292
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,280
Okay, nice.

293
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,040
Oh, we're in this entrance.

294
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,000
Never mind.

295
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,060
We're in a completely different place than I thought we were.

296
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,660
That's okay, though.

297
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,100
We'll be quiet thanks to the bomb.

298
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,540
Reservoir shortcut to the left of the hangar.

299
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,300
Wait, what do you mean by that?

300
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,040
There's a shortcut?

301
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,640
Oh.

302
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,240
There's a shortcut?

303
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,560
I don't think so.

304
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,460
Oh, the elevator, but not here.

305
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,060
Oh, yeah, yeah.

306
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,780
No worries.

307
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,460
It's all good.

308
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,840
We can just kind of get there.

309
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,280
I like taking the river.

310
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,760
Down, down, down by the river.

311
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,180
Does anyone still remember that game?

312
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
Whatever happened to Baldur's Gate?

313
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,160
Okay, we're just going all the way to the end, everybody.

314
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,060
Are we going down or up?

315
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,320
Yes.

316
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,520
I think we're going up.

317
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,680
I don't know.

318
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:38,720
I don't know.

319
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,510
Yeah, it's still big, is it?

320
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,090
I never finished it.

321
00:15:49,530 --> 00:16:02,230
I don't know, maybe I think it was because like, for me, I didn't understand so much because I'm not into, uh, what do you call, into D&D so much.

322
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,630
So there was like a lot that I felt like I kind of missed out on because I was like, I don't understand some of this lore.

323
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:16,610
They kind of throw you into the game and expect you to kind of understand like, you know, certain roles and certain...

324
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,950
Okay, over here, right?

325
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,450
Let's go over this way.

326
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,630
It's a pretty long game.

327
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,790
Yeah, whoa, why is this version of...

328
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,290
Wait, have I not heard this song?

329
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,470
This version of the song?

330
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,350
It sounds kind of different.

331
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:42,870
Okay.

332
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,190
Oh, wait, no, we went in here.

333
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,150
We can't read.

334
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,330
We did go in here.

335
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,810
Was it over here?

336
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,150
Did I not go in here?

337
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,910
Can't read.

338
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,990
No, we did go in here.

339
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,090
Wait, what am I missing?

340
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,930
Now that...

341
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,170
Oh, I'm kind of confused.

342
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,920
Taking your lantern?

343
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,720
In here, maybe?

344
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,160
This projector room?

345
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,920
Okay...

346
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,460
Maybe in here?

347
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
There's a slideshow in there.

348
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,940
Hello?

349
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh no!

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,080
No!

351
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,600
Oh, it's okay though.

352
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,340
We'll just open it back up.

353
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,140
No biggie.

354
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,760
Oh, maybe... here?

355
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,340
No, I remember getting baited by this before.

356
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,500
Oh gosh, so scary.

357
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,360
The door to nowhere.

358
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,710
I think that was our first time seeing it.

359
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,470
Actually...

360
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,550
Why does it flicker like that?

361
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,630
Uh oh.

362
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,710
We don't have much time.

363
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,230
Well, we have time, but we don't have time.

364
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,670
Let's see.

365
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,830
Maybe down below?

366
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,970
Wait, is there a down below?

367
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,670
Where could be?

368
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,770
The projector?

369
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,570
Or the slide?

370
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,730
I can't... sorry.

371
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,810
If you guys...

372
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,790
If I forget something and you're just like It's at this place.

373
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,690
That's totally okay.

374
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,650
Don't tell me, because it's me forgetting.

375
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,670
If you remember.

376
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:01,970
Sometimes.

377
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,730
My brain is small.

378
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,170
K R Z!

379
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,390
Welcome to the bamboo ship.

380
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,290
Thank you!

381
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,690
I can't remember what this was.

382
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,970
I think it was like...

383
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,890
No, I can't remember at all.

384
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,710
But we went in here.

385
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,790
This is where the password is.

386
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,870
They write it on the walls, because they're just you know, really silly about it.

387
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,190
Right there!

388
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,010
She's traded brains for thumbnail booba.

389
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,890
I'm like that meme of the girl that picks up the book or whatever.

390
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,750
I'm the opposite of that meme.

391
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,230
Sun, I fire, I fire.

392
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,590
Sun, I fire, I fire.

393
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,450
Sun, I fire, I fire.

394
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,610
Sun,

395
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,990
I fire, I fire.

396
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,530
Sun, I fire, I fire.

397
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,090
I fire, I fire.

398
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,170
Now I do remember this room.

399
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,730
K R Z!

400
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,570
Thanks for the gift!

401
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:16,950
K R Z!

402
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,950
Thanks for the gift!

403
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,830
So you turned bimbo?

404
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,910
I guess so.

405
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,880
What am I missing in this area?

406
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,780
What am I missing in this area?

407
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,060
What am I missing in here?

408
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,720
Is it in the other house that we had to go break into?

409
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,480
No, shoot.

410
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,500
Mike Tyson!

411
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
Thank you for the gift!

412
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,840
Over yonder.

413
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,970
It's near the bait door?

414
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,950
I'm not kidding?

415
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:58,470
Okay.

416
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,450
I'm trusting you.

417
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,190
I'm trusting you Superfly Dan Fry.

418
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,310
I'm calling you by your full legal name.

419
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,390
Right now.

420
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,590
I'm calling you by your full legal name.

421
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,070
I'm calling you by your full legal name.

422
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,250
I thought that there would be something to do with the bait door, right?

423
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:16,630
I thought that there would be something to do with the bait door, right?

424
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,730
Because it's like, Why else would they- I mean, I don't know why else they would have it.

425
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,830
Just to make you feel a little goofy.

426
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,650
But I don't see anything over there.

427
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,630
I see something hanging.

428
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,270
Okay, I'm going to the bait door.

429
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,610
To troll.

430
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,010
Down from the bait door.

431
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,450
No way.

432
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,950
Like in the water?

433
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,690
Like down, down?

434
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,910
Down, down, down by the river?

435
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,360
No help.

436
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,800
Give him credit if he's right then.

437
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,640
I absolutely will.

438
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,620
Here we go.

439
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,120
I think I should bring my...

440
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,280
I saw!

441
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,660
I see!

442
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:20,960
I see!

443
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,160
I see!

444
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
You were right!

445
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,140
Superfly Dan Fry!

446
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,800
That was it, right?

447
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,860
You were right!

448
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,500
Oh my gosh.

449
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,860
I think maybe they could have had it like kind of glinting in the water for dummies like me, you know?

450
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,480
But also dummies like me should not be playing this game.

451
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,420
Because, you know...

452
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,060
Oh my gosh, Matorakon!

453
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh.

454
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,020
That was fast.

455
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,570
I can see fire.

456
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,580
More fire.

457
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,540
Something's going on in there.

458
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,700
I swear, if this is all that it was...

459
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,320
If this is all that it is...

460
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,400
Oh, the guys.

461
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,360
The deer people.

462
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,860
Oh!

463
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,500
They show up.

464
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,460
They're walking.

465
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,800
They're coming real close.

466
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,040
They're coming close!

467
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,580
Um...

468
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,500
Oh!

469
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,580
Wait, in the thumbnail of Gengar is a ghost like meant to take over Gengar's body?

470
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,440
Wish that was me.

471
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,660
No, I just dressed up as Gengar, obviously.

472
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,060
Okay.

473
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,780
Oh, yes, yes.

474
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,540
We knew that.

475
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,520
That...

476
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,560
So they built the thing around Matorakon.

477
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Wow, they imprisoned her.

478
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,400
And sunk her in the water.

479
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,720
They were like, see ya!

480
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,940
That's it.

481
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,590
Ship log updated.

482
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,610
Okay.

483
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,690
Hmm.

484
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,510
Hmm.

485
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,770
I think it's because we already kind of knew that that was in there.

486
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,530
So it wasn't like so...

487
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,090
You know, we already knew...

488
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,490
About the entrance in there.

489
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,150
We already knew about...

490
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,290
This being a thing.

491
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,310
So...

492
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,030
Now to explore the scary place.

493
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,310
I don't...

494
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,590
I don't...

495
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,510
I don't wanna...

496
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,190
Wait.

497
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,320
We're going in.

498
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,280
We'll go in through here, I guess.

499
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,420
Wait.

500
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,200
This is the one...

501
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,440
This is actually probably the area that we need to explore the least.

502
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,460
Now that I think about it.

503
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,800
But...

504
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,760
Um...

505
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,660
Oh, yeah.

506
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,360
I am gonna...

507
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,680
I am...

508
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:45,880
Wait.

509
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,420
Does this take us to the tower, though?

510
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:47,840
Doesn't it?

511
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,380
I don't know.

512
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,620
Hello.

513
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,340
I'm just gonna...

514
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,280
Yeah.

515
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,460
We need to unleash this.

516
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,820
Do we?

517
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,040
No!

518
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,070
Do we need to unleash it?

519
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,350
You know what?

520
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,170
I'm just gonna doze off.

521
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:07,590
Good night.

522
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,290
Wake up.

523
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:15,790
Oh!

524
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,350
Oh.

525
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,110
Good night.

526
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:19,570
Oh.

527
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:19,790
No.

528
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,110
No.

529
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,290
No.

530
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:20,810
Good night.

531
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,670
Oh.

532
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,260
Did I wake up too soon?

533
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,020
Oh, I don't have the artifact!

534
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,420
Oh shoot.

535
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,460
I don't even remember where to get one.

536
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,860
I don't even remember where to get one.

537
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,880
Maybe...

538
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,880
Sheep or gore.

539
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,540
I truly did.

540
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,560
I truly forgot about that part.

541
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,320
I'm thinking... You know what?

542
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,220
I'm just gonna meditate in the next loop and then we'll go...

543
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,160
We'll start from...

544
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,520
We'll start from scratch.

545
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,960
Near the egg.

546
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,760
So...

547
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,640
Since we already had the bridge explode...

548
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,460
I think we'll start over.

549
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,840
We got what we needed there.

550
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,510
And we shall...

551
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,290
Come back.

552
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,830
Let's continue onward.

553
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,590
I can't believe my eyes played such a trick on me.

554
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,290
I really thought it was something disappearing.

555
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,510
But it was just... I really thought it was an egg.

556
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,270
That was like dancing around.

557
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,390
But it was...

558
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,830
Just a water droplet.

559
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,810
How could I...

560
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,830
How could I gaslight myself so much?

561
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,970
The egg.

562
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,250
Okay.

563
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,890
Okay.

564
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,450
Okay.

565
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,310
Slideshow that shows a strange vault being encased in a large metal structure and lowered under water.

566
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,890
Nearly all the slides have been burned and cannot be viewed.

567
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,970
Yeah, it was so useless.

568
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,610
Thank you.

569
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,530
According to the slide, real strange vault...

570
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:19,890
OK.

571
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,390
Which we know.

572
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,210
That's what that is.

573
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,090
I feel like they expected you to find this...

574
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,070
Way sooner.

575
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,730
I'm sorry, I'm not playing Subnautica here.

576
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,470
I'm not diving underwater all the time.

577
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,190
The real egg was the friends we made along the way.

578
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,930
Pro-gast lighter.

579
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,590
I don't remember how to get to which one.

580
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,030
I don't remember how we get to the Shrouded Woodlands...

581
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,110
versus how we get to the Starlit Cove.

582
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,030
But this cave is very intriguing.

583
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,130
Kindlelit Tower sits atop a nearby island.

584
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,210
And then the Endless Canyon.

585
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,150
I can't remember how we get to...

586
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,610
Woodlands is the first one.

587
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,170
I wonder...

588
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,310
if we're able to get to the cliffside building...

589
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,190
by somehow waking up...

590
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,190
when...

591
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,030
we're in this building...

592
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,810
in the other world.

593
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,430
If that's how we get to it.

594
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,030
That's what I'm thinking.

595
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,130
But I...

596
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,390
Hidden Vault Seals!

597
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,050
Impossible.

598
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,230
Impossible.

599
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,090
Impossible.

600
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,710
But we need to find this cliffside building, I suppose.

601
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,870
I'm imagining it would maybe be in the Endless Canyon.

602
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,850
The Endless Eighth Canyon.

603
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,130
Want Elp or no Elp?

604
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,710
I will ask for Elp...

605
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,610
when I'm like truly desperate.

606
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,110
But I appreciate it.

607
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,610
Shrouded Woodlands...

608
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,010
Okay, so this is the first one.

609
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:27,970
Uhh...

610
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,050
Is this the...

611
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,650
This looks to be the tower?

612
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,590
When we come out of the tower?

613
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,310
Is this...

614
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,250
the tower...

615
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:35,610
the...

616
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,170
the one...

617
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,170
and then...

618
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,190
Let's go...

619
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,430
to the Endless Canyon.

620
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,120
What a thumbnail.

621
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm successfully...

622
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,940
playing YouTube, you guys.

623
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,340
I'm...

624
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,720
I'm clickbaiting.

625
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm...

626
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,260
you know...

627
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,420
doing all that good stuff.

628
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,920
So...

629
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,420
Say the word if need Elp.

630
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,280
Thank you.

631
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,390
Please clickbait more.

632
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,390
You dirty dirties.

633
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,220
Okay, so where we need to go...

634
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,280
is...

635
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,080
do a little somersault.

636
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Foolproof plan.

637
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,300
We need to go to...

638
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,280
the right side.

639
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,300
I believe.

640
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,370
Perfect landing.

641
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,270
She knows us so well.

642
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,630
The chat reflects the streamer.

643
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,870
Cute ball.

644
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,150
Thanks for the five.

645
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,410
I'm gifted.

646
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,110
Thank you.

647
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,750
Push, push.

648
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,670
Push, push.

649
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,320
Yesterday's thumbnail was top tier.

650
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,200
Stummy and...

651
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,680
Stop.

652
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,060
Oh my goodness.

653
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,900
So easy.

654
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,100
Sometimes less is more you guys.

655
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:19,480
You know.

656
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,560
Don't ever forget that.

657
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,150
Happy Outer Wilds.

658
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,210
Thank you.

659
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,510
Come on.

660
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,570
Come on.

661
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,670
Come on.

662
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,230
Come on.

663
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:36,790
Come on.

664
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:36,990
Come on.

665
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,190
Come on.

666
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,250
Come on.

667
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,430
Okay, to the right.

668
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:40,850
To the right.

669
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,470
To the right.

670
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:41,850
To the right.

671
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,250
To the right.

672
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:42,590
To the right.

673
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,390
This way.

674
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:43,690
This way.

675
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,030
This way.

676
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,270
This way.

677
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,390
Okay, nice.

678
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,170
But I don't want to get... I don't want to get sucked up.

679
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,690
Unless it's this one.

680
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:53,850
No, no.

681
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,330
That's not one.

682
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:54,810
That's not one.

683
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,790
It needs the symbol.

684
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,470
It needs the symbol.

685
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,790
Love Outer Wilds.

686
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,530
Hope you're enjoying the DLC.

687
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,470
I am!

688
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,930
Thank you!

689
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,630
Grimy?

690
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:04,370
Grim?

691
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,430
Grimy?

692
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,690
Grimy.

693
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:12,810
Grimy.

694
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,430
Grimy.

695
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,770
Grimy.

696
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,690
Grimy.

697
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:14,690
Grimy.

698
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,130
Grimy.

699
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,130
Grimy.

700
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,590
Grimy.

701
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:16,850
Grimy.

702
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,170
Grimy.

703
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:19,470
Grimy.

704
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:19,570
Grimy.

705
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:19,570
Grimy.

706
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:19,570
Grimy.

707
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:19,570
Grimy.

708
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:19,970
Grimy.

709
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:19,970
Grimy.

710
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:19,970
Grimy.

711
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:19,970
Grimy.

712
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:19,970
Grimy.

713
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:19,970
Grimy.

714
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,270
Grimy.

715
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,270
Grimy.

716
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,270
Grimy.

717
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,270

718
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,270
Grimy.

719
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,270
Grimy.

720
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,270
Grimy.

721
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,270

726
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,350

727
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:20,350
Grimy.

728
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:20,750
Grimy.

729
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:20,770
Grimy.

730
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:20,770
Grimy.

731
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,410
Grimy.

732
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:21,730
Grimy.

733
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:21,730
Grimy.

734
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:21,730

740
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:21,730

741
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:21,730

742
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:21,730

743

759
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,150

762
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:30,190

764
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,070
Grimy.

765
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,310
Grimy.

766
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,810
Gr I guess it's all good.

767
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,470
Now I gotta remember where to get an artifact.

768
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,170
Stick.

769
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,290
Let's go to the other side.

770
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,110
Wait, wait, how do I... how did I get up there before?

771
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,450
Because this doesn't work, right?

772
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,310
Yeah, this one's broken.

773
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,990
The other one is not broken.

774
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,720
Oh!

775
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,500
I thought this was one for the boat.

776
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,500
My bad.

777
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,580
I thought this was... I thought it was one for the boat.

778
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,660
Like I thought it was one to pick up your boat.

779
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,160
My bad.

780
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,800
Up please.

781
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,140
Up, up, up please.

782
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,710
You guys, it's fine.

783
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,870
It's all good.

784
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,750
Everything is fine.

785
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:18,670
This is definitely like a game though that can be really difficult to orient yourself.

786
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,870
I only haven't played it in a week.

787
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,550
You know?

788
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,090
Like if you haven't played it for even longer, I can't even imagine how...

789
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:32,270
like difficult it might be to remember things, you know?

790
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,290
Oh, so this is the entrance.

791
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,270
Ah!

792
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,810
This is the entrance through the hole.

793
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,630
We know this entrance.

794
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,290
But we don't have to go back in there.

795
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,090
I think we're pretty good.

796
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,110
The DLC is much harder.

797
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,610
I am...

798
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,710
So far.

799
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:58,490
I think there's a few things that have been stumping me.

800
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,170
But I've gotten some of the other puzzles.

801
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,740
This is the room where they burn...

802
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,840
They have to burn the...

803
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,660
This is all...

804
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,880
Has all the ghost matter though.

805
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,700
Also, can we reverse burn?

806
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,720
Let's see.

807
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,560
Is there anything in here?

808
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,340
Oh wait.

809
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,580
We have to go down here, right?

810
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,560
I don't remember where the artifact is.

811
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,640
But we'll find it, I'm sure.

812
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,440
We go here.

813
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,360
No!

814
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,180
Wait.

815
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,420
Artifact?

816
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,620
Oh, there's a real in here.

817
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,380
I don't think...

818
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,080
Maybe we...

819
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,040
Maybe it's in the...

820
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,780
In the projector room.

821
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,060
Oh, look!

822
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,140
Look!

823
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,220
Ouch.

824
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,100
I think it's usually in like the projector basement, right?

825
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,160
I believe...

826
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,170
What is that?

827
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,590
There's one in here.

828
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:32,890
Yes!

829
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,590
Okay.

830
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,590
All right, let's get going.

831
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,020
Like the panels flicker.

832
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:52,000
So either makes me think it's like they're...

833
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,140
They're like a screen of some sort.

834
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,260
It's not really a view of the outside or something.

835
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,940
I don't know.

836
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,080
I have no idea.

837
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,780
And open up, please.

838
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,060
Thank you.

839
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,820
Wait.

840
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,400
Wait.

841
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,460
Oh lee...

842
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,740
Oh gosh.

843
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
I'm all...

844
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,800
I'm so

845
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,150
scared!

846
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,500
I'm so scared.

847
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,820
Oh gosh.

848
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,280
Sleepover party...

849
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,380
I miss when we were just...

850
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,200
We were just a weird cult.

851
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,200
We were a weird cult, man.

852
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,680
I miss those days.

853
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,310
Now here, we do know that there's a guy.

854
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,130
Okay, so maybe...

855
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,950
I thought I saw something walking.

856
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,530
What is that down there?

857
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,170
There must be some more text, right?

858
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,630
Okay.

859
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,450
Oh gosh.

860
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,630
No wonder.

861
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,430
You know what?

862
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,470
When people were like, the DLC got too spooky for me.

863
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,650
Too spooky for me.

864
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,630
I couldn't complete it.

865
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,170
I get it.

866
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,570
I get it.

867
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,050
I get it.

868
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,530
I get it.

869
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,450
I really get it.

870
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,110
Before, I was just like, I don't know.

871
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,910
How spooky will this get?

872
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,730
The game... wait, this isn't where the person was singing though, right?

873
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,630
I was like, how spooky can this get?

874
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,150
I was like... you know.

875
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,930
The whole game before, like the original game, was definitely eerie.

876
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,730
But like, scary?

877
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,150
I didn't think so.

878
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,650
It gets worse!

879
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,560
My stomach hurts.

880
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,760
This is the first area we came into.

881
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,140
When I first...

882
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,040
When we first came to the other world.

883
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,200
I can't quite remember where all we went.

884
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,720
I remember being too afraid to continue in certain areas.

885
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,300
There is a baby mode if it's too scary.

886
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,270
But I don't want to be a baby!

887
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,530
Oh, we haven't seen this area.

888
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,030
See, look, they seem pretty friendly, right?

889
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,210
They have their own little music shows.

890
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,590
And stuff.

891
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,610
They don't seem so bad.

892
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,850
This is where they perform.

893
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,590
And stuff.

894
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,810
And when...

895
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,510
Oh, extinguish.

896
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,570
Bad people don't like music.

897
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,510
What are the instruments made of?

898
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,870
Wood?

899
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,310
Right?

900
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,190
Is that an antler?

901
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,230
Maybe they are bad.

902
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,770
I'm curious though.

903
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,490
What...

904
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,350
You can say it's a spoiler if you...

905
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,190
If I can't know.

906
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,530
But what does...

907
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,350
Turning on baby mode do?

908
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,230
Because if it's like a huge imp...

909
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,850
It's a spoiler?

910
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,150
Dang it!

911
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,430
Okay, I'll believe you.

912
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,760
We have to get in there somehow.

913
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,920
Because this...

914
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,120
Goes to here.

915
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,900
And makes a bridge.

916
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,040
Okay.

917
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,600
I remember getting grabby grabbed over here.

918
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,200
Right there, I believe.

919
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,040
Or...

920
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,200
Somewhere.

921
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,200
Oh my god.

922
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,260
That tree just scared the heck out of me!

923
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,200
Okay.

924
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,660
Yeah, we were there before but time ran out.

925
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,240
Yes, yes.

926
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,760
Oh, wait.

927
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,700
This is where we get grabby grabbed.

928
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:09,860
Maybe.

929
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,660
Turning on baby mode drastically reduces...

930
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,540
Your speed.

931
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:12,940
Pussy.

932
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,920
To the ground.

933
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,720
As babies crawl.

934
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,880
Uh oh.

935
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,040
I think that was...

936
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,040
Okay, so we do have to go downstairs.

937
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:31,450
Everything's okay.

938
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,430
Don't worry about it, man.

939
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,650
No need to scream.

940
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:37,410
Or anything.

941
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,510
Okay, he's still there.

942
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,300
Have to be a little quicker.

943
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,660
Okay.

944
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,340
Alright.

945
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,560
Is this area fine though?

946
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,600
I think I'll be safe.

947
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,040
I think.

948
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,300
I think I'll be safe.

949
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,140
From the water is what I mean.

950
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,380
I think I'll be safe from...

951
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,400
From the water.

952
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,280
Um...

953
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,760
Oh god!

954
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,500
Oh god!

955
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,640
Not from anything else!

956
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm...

957
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,440
I'm...

958
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,480
Okay.

959
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,340
I think I've went through all of this area.

960
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,080
But...

961
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,140
It doesn't hurt to...

962
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,340
To...

963
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,840
Try again, I'd say.

964
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,960
Doesn't hurt to try again.

965
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,900
What was that?

966
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,170
I wanna go to baby mode.

967
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:41,670
Okay.

968
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,350
Now that you guys have reminded me, I'm like...

969
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,010
Sounds like a pretty good option.

970
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,590
Not gonna lie.

971
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,190
Sounds like a pretty good option.

972
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,310
Not gonna lie.

973
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:04,990
Which is open.

974
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,010
Thought I just heard a door open.

975
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,270
Oh!

976
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:13,890
Oh!

977
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,760
Oh shit!

978
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,260
Oh shit!

979
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,340
There's an actual guy there!

980
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,380
Is it a friendly guy?

981
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:45,900
Surely.

982
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,400
That's why I'm able to conceal my, uh...

983
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,640
Can he hear footsteps?

984
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,580
That's a good question, I wonder.

985
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,620
He's just pacing.

986
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,000
Waiting for death...

987
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,340
Probably.

988
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,000
Probably.

989
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,160
Only one way to find out.

990
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,440
Is he gonna, like...

991
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,420
Run out the door if he sees me?

992
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,580
Be like...

993
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,380
I wanna

994
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,640
see him.

995
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,300
But I also...

996
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:32,860
I'm so scared!

997
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,000
I

998
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,640
want to see him.

999
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,840
Okay.

1000
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,760
Let's just continue onwards.

1001
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,560
Oh, here we go.

1002
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:01,950
He won't notice me.

1003
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:03,450
He's not gonna come out.

1004
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:03,970
Right.

1005
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,110
Okay.

1006
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,790
We gotta go back to the grabby grab.

1007
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,770
I gotta make a little bit of progress.

1008
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,550
Come on.

1009
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:17,470
Uh...

1010
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,810
Can't see anything anymore.

1011
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:19,350
There we go.

1012
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:26,800
Just, uh...

1013
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,620
Just act like you belong!

1014
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,840
Just act like you belong!

1015
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:31,820
Oh, wait!

1016
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,460
Oh, no!

1017
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,320
The grabby grab is up there!

1018
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,080
I made a...

1019
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,840
I made a fatal mistake.

1020
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,740
My bad.

1021
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,080
It's, uh...

1022
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,540
Here.

1023
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,160
Grabby grab?

1024
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,700
Wait, where is it?

1025
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,460
Grabby!

1026
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,460
Where is it?

1027
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,340
Oh?

1028
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,420
Is it here?

1029
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,400
I saw it though!

1030
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,060
What do you mean?

1031
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,660
Do I do it from... oh my god.

1032
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,240
Keep walking?

1033
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,480
What do you mean, keep walking?

1034
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,870
He's gonna... he's gonna see me.

1035
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,790
So eerie and all, right?

1036
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,550
Oh my gosh, I really wanna see him.

1037
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:48,770
I'm so curious!

1038
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,730
What does he look like?

1039
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,330
Maybe over here.

1040
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,940
Maybe over here.

1041
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,220
Found it!

1042
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,120
I found it.

1043
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,880
Oh good, it's even like a shortcut, so... awesome.

1044
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,700
Okay... let's see what else can we find in here.

1045
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,240
Okay, there's some more stuff over here.

1046
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,100
Okay, stuff over here, stuff over here.

1047
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,600
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1048
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,500
Is this a horror game?

1049
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,760
It might as well be, right?

1050
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,200
Where are we going?

1051
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,340
Glad I didn't miss the excitement!

1052
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,100
I thought... for some reason I read OW is Overwatch.

1053
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,760
Skelem, thank you!

1054
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:53,820
Yeah!

1055
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,420
Oh, wait!

1056
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,780
This is the place where the... okay, we know where this is, because when I do this, the boat appears!

1057
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,240
Ah, this is another way to get on the boat!

1058
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,000
Okay, that's good to know, actually.

1059
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,500
Because it's not... I mean, well...

1060
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,140
It's a little annoying to get here, but it's not so far out of the way if we ever need to get back on the boat.

1061
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,380
Well...

1062
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,640
Overwatch is not the most wonderful game.

1063
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,940
I mean, to each their own.

1064
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,960
I agree with you, but...

1065
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,570
This isn't Overwatch?

1066
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,040
So that means the tower fell, right?

1067
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:52,840
I believe.

1068
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,640
And so we're about out of time.

1069
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,520
Hahaha!

1070
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,780
Wait, but I just made it here!

1071
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,620
Wait,

1072
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,040
what's this?

1073
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,140
The tree...

1074
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,400
The base of a tree...

1075
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,200
Is an entrance?

1076
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,220
Okay...

1077
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,720
I really like music.

1078
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,330
Okay, what else can I find in here?

1079
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,150
Before...

1080
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,190
Before our demise...

1081
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:31,590
Hmm...

1082
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,110
I think there's something in here, but...

1083
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:37,590
Time's up.

1084
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,690
Yup, time's up.

1085
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,730
Do you think they know that they're in a time loop as well?

1086
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,010
These alien creatures?

1087
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,330
Their chairs look like toilets.

1088
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,090
They look like toilet seats.

1089
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,250
Maybe that's how we know we cannot trust them.

1090
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,210
Go ask them.

1091
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,530
Hey, do you know that you're about to die in like two seconds?

1092
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:02,650
I think they know.

1093
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,130
Open up!

1094
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,600
Wonder what this means.

1095
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,540
Well, we at least found some stuff.

1096
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,960
I think this is the end of the road for this area at least, so...

1097
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,020
We're about to...

1098
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,380
Hmm...

1099
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,240
It's crooked.

1100
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,240
Wish I could fix it.

1101
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,090
Oh my gosh, it's so quiet.

1102
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:40,830
It's so...

1103
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:41,650
Eerie.

1104
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,230
Just...

1105
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,990
We'll just, uh...

1106
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,490
Wait for your...

1107
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,430
Death to take us...

1108
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,670
Now.

1109
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,510
Hmm...

1110
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,090
I prefer it to be quiet.

1111
00:52:59,210 --> 00:52:59,670
No way!

1112
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,610
It's too scary!

1113
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,350
Can we go back to the boat?

1114
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,850
I'm scared.

1115
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:06,890
I'm scared.

1116
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,070
I'm scared.

1117
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:07,310
I'm scared.

1118
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,150
I'm scared.

1119
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:10,270
Hmm...

1120
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,520
I wonder what else it's gonna say about this area...

1121
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,820
Your yapping got me through my master's!

1122
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,420
Oh my gosh!

1123
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,520
Thank you for the super chat!

1124
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:32,960
Congratulations!

1125
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,240
Here's to four more years!

1126
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,060
Four more years!

1127
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,260
Angel, thanks for the gift!

1128
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,040
Masters...

1129
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,700
Literally... wait.

1130
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,540
I found a mural of a large tree at the bottom floor of the lodge.

1131
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:51,680
Oh!

1132
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,300
That really is everything there!

1133
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,280
Nice!

1134
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,180
I'm so curious though.

1135
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,660
What if I go back and I have my lantern on right by the guy?

1136
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,100
Oh!

1137
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,200
I want him to see me!

1138
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,180
I'm so curious.

1139
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,540
Okay, but that area has been explored.

1140
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,600
So very cool, very cool.

1141
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,280
Do it?

1142
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,560
Do it?

1143
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,600
You want to trigger alert 100?

1144
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,780
I kind of do.

1145
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,880
Okay, we're going to go do it?

1146
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,080
What's the easiest way to get there?

1147
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:31,240
Oh.

1148
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,060
I'm trying to think of the easiest way to get there.

1149
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,350
What's the worst that could happen?

1150
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,630
But it's also kind of a pain in the butt to get all the way over there, isn't it?

1151
00:54:59,370 --> 00:54:59,690
Hmm...

1152
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,310
Nah, we'll just go to the other areas.

1153
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,050
It's fine.

1154
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:06,970
It's fine.

1155
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,990
We'll go to the other areas.

1156
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,090
The hole gets you straight to that area.

1157
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,650
Oh, you're right!

1158
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:16,810
Oh, but the hole is such a pain in the butt to get into.

1159
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:18,570
Oh!

1160
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:18,890
Oh!

1161
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,310
Oh!

1162
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,140
Where's...

1163
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:27,660
Ah!

1164
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:28,700
Ah!

1165
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,200
Oh!

1166
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,000
Oh!

1167
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,060
My bad.

1168
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,420
Which hole?

1169
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,380
It's like a...

1170
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,560
It's like a little hole in the ship.

1171
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,260
Yeah, I literally was just like, the hole brings us there.

1172
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,280
Perfect!

1173
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,860
I'm sure it's fine.

1174
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,540
I'm sure it doesn't need any... I think it's okay.

1175
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,280
It's just a little scratch.

1176
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,360
Raiders?

1177
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,500
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1178
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,620
Thanks for the raid!

1179
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,700
I didn't see who raided.

1180
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,920
Raymac, thanks for the gifted!

1181
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,620
Wait, thank you so much!

1182
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:11,860
Sorry.

1183
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,840
I've been... gaming.

1184
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,010
Hello, hello.

1185
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,310
We're playing Outer Wilds, which is a spooky...

1186
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:25,550
Well, it's not a spooky game, but this is a very spooky DLC.

1187
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,310
So if you're not good with spooky things...

1188
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:30,490
Uh...

1189
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,590
Oh, I remember what to do here.

1190
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,110
If you're not good with spooky things...

1191
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,450
Viewer discretion.

1192
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,150
Happy Tuesday.

1193
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,730
Happy... Happy Tuesday.

1194
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,150
Murphy, thanks for the five gifted.

1195
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:45,850
Thank you!

1196
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,070
Thank you, guys!

1197
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,470
Tomorrow, I have... um...

1198
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,790
I have karaoke.

1199
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,990
If you... want to watch that.

1200
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,890
I'll have karaoke, and then right after, I'm going to play Doom.

1201
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,750
Early, early in the morning...

1202
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,530
I'm kind of nervous, or worried, because early, early in the morning, I have to...

1203
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,530
I'm taking my cat to the vet.

1204
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,170
I'm getting him an ultrasound.

1205
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,630
So, I'm going to be up super duper early to do that.

1206
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,110
And then...

1207
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:23,830
Oh, artifact.

1208
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,370
And then...

1209
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,470
And then streaming two times.

1210
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,090
And then I have stuff that I'm doing at night.

1211
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,830
So, it's just a lot of craziness.

1212
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,330
Tomorrow.

1213
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,510
This whole week has been a little crazy busy for me.

1214
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:41,910
This is the one...

1215
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,690
No, this is not the one that's missing a person.

1216
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:44,450
Look how creepy!

1217
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,710
This is our... This is our cult friends.

1218
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,310
This guy is even like...

1219
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,210
You can't be hiding.

1220
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,710
Stop.

1221
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,470
Get your fingers off of there.

1222
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:58,630
Don't hide the light.

1223
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,070
Okay, let's take... Let's doze off.

1224
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,510
Hope it turns out to be a good day, Mint.

1225
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,270
Thank you.

1226
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,770
Give our thank you!

1227
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:09,950
Got my postcard today.

1228
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,110
I'm happy to say both of your faces were in mint condition.

1229
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,590
Who's the boing boing mint cosplayer in the thumbnail?

1230
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:16,510
Stop!

1231
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,710
What are you talking about?

1232
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,200
They're average!

1233
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,220
This is the one where we get on the boat, isn't it?

1234
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,140
Am I... Am I...

1235
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,300
I think we can get on the boat or we can go somewhere else.

1236
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,920
But somewhere else sounds really scary.

1237
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,760
And the boat sounds like a lovely location to be in.

1238
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,340
The boat sounds like a really lovely location.

1239
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,180
And everywhere else sounds not so lovely and nice.

1240
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,480
The boat sounds really comfortable.

1241
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,180
And everywhere else sounds really scary.

1242
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,160
And I don't like it.

1243
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,540
Which... I know this is not the direction of the boat.

1244
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,980
So I'm a little frightened.

1245
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,060
What is this?

1246
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,260
Oh.

1247
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,300
Where is this going?

1248
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:21,400
Actually...

1249
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,460
Now that I think about it, I have no idea.

1250
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,280
Is this where... I think...

1251
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,880
I was gonna say, I think this is where we saw someone walking around.

1252
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,900
And there... they were down there!

1253
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,400
I saw a light moving!

1254
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,200
I saw a light moving!

1255
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,060
I don't know!

1256
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,860
Is that where we're headed?

1257
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,800
Please say no.

1258
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,600
This is an egg.

1259
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,960
No, it is very much...

1260
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,640
Not a figment of my imagination.

1261
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,520
It is very much real.

1262
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,800
I'm most afraid that it allows you to extinguish the lights here.

1263
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,520
That's what terrifies me the most.

1264
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:23,200
I'm

1265
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:29,920
brave.

1266
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:30,760
I'm brave.

1267
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,060
I'm...

1268
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,460
Oh, that's the electricity.

1269
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:43,640
Oh!

1270
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,700
The controller just vibrated a little bit.

1271
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,400
Okay, so this doesn't really lead to anywhere, actually.

1272
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,580
Unless it's this direction.

1273
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,920
I'm being brave.

1274
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:57,660
I'm being brave.

1275
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,300
I'm being...

1276
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,480
I'm being brave.

1277
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,080
I'm being brave.

1278
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:00,500
I'm being brave.

1279
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,040
It's to save the candle.

1280
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:09,460
Yeah!

1281
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:14,920
Oh!

1282
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,800
Wait, what is this?

1283
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,670
Guys, I don't think I'm as brave as I think I am.

1284
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,900
I don't think I'm as brave as I think I am.

1285
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,850
I'm just scoping out the area.

1286
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,230
I think I'm actually gonna...

1287
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,130
I think I'm actually gonna pee myself.

1288
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,530
Is true happiness throwing bricks at me?

1289
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,650
What are you talking about?

1290
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,310
He's down there.

1291
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:27,810
You see him?

1292
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:31,750
Oh, that's close.

1293
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,270
Wait, is he a zombie?

1294
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,310
No way.

1295
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,870
Wait, this is where the show is.

1296
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,750
Wait, I kinda wanna go see the show.

1297
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,000
I can't see anything.

1298
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,100
I can't see anything.

1299
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,220
I don't know, like...

1300
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,800
Oh my god, there's two of them!

1301
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,900
Are they zombie guys?

1302
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:20,970
Hold on.

1303
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,970
There's two of them.

1304
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:23,550
There's two of them.

1305
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,530
I don't know, like, what their range is, is what I meant to say.

1306
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:28,890
I think I almost said hitbox.

1307
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,590
I don't know what their range is.

1308
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,680
I can't tell where the other guy went.

1309
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:43,030
Oh, there's a chair.

1310
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,190
Oh no, wait, they're gonna see me.

1311
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:51,750
Where'd he go?

1312
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,890
Where'd the other guy go?

1313
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,630
We saw him.

1314
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:55,330
There were two of them.

1315
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:55,850
There were two of them.

1316
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,030
Extinguish.

1317
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,330
I literally can't see anything, though.

1318
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,410
Holy cow, it's so dark.

1319
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,140
Just watching his oshi.

1320
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:18,980
Don't disturb him.

1321
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,480
Just watching his oshi.

1322
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:21,480
Don't disturb him.

1323
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,520
Don't disturb him.

1324
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,840
Okay.

1325
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,880
I don't see anyone else, so...

1326
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,920
Whoa, just kidding.

1327
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:28,920
I just...

1328
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,820
Unless it was a star.

1329
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,980
Unless it was a shining star in the sky.

1330
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,600
There he is!

1331
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:34,980
There he is!

1332
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:35,260
There he is!

1333
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,480
There's one guy, and I think the other guy is leaving.

1334
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,600
I love hearing Mint in the background with screams.

1335
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,340
Maybe the artifact is just an alien penlight.

1336
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,000
Oh, Jesus.

1337
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,740
I'm further away from the place, but I think we have to go...

1338
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,900
I heard a whistle.

1339
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,860
I'm gonna get caught for sure, you guys.

1340
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,840
I'm gonna get so caught.

1341
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,240
I'm gonna get caught for sure.

1342
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,520
I'm gonna get caught for sure.

1343
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,280
I just got grabby-grabbed.

1344
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,920
And I think I...

1345
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,340
Actually, I think I need to go back over there.

1346
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,620
Wait, so I've been here because these candles are lit up.

1347
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:37,780
Right?

1348
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,560
Or am I crazy?

1349
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,580
Have I been here?

1350
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:42,860
No.

1351
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,160
Maybe?

1352
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:44,960
Huh?

1353
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:45,680
Where am I?

1354
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:48,880
Shortcut!

1355
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:51,420
Okay.

1356
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:03,820
Oh!

1357
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:05,740
Wait.

1358
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:22,190
Oh my god!

1359
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,130
There's so many of them!

1360
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:30,210
They're all going for... the show is ended though.

1361
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,450
You guys are late.

1362
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:33,890
Nah, they're going for Bupan.

1363
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:35,970
They're going to go see their Oshi.

1364
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,510
They're gonna go get goods merch and stuff.

1365
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,590
But I know that if I don't...

1366
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,150
If I don't hurry up...

1367
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,130
If the bridge is gonna break and...

1368
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,830
I won't be able to get there at all.

1369
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,350
There it is!

1370
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,930
Our flame's gonna go out!

1371
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:55,590
Oh no!

1372
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,590
I was too slow, but can you blame me?

1373
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,150
Okay, I'm gonna run up to him.

1374
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:11,690
Dang.

1375
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:12,850
Dang.

1376
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:17,470
Okay.

1377
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:19,850
Oh gosh.

1378
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,630
Well, we know where we need to go there.

1379
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,430
It's just...

1380
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,550
Yikes.

1381
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:27,610
Oh gosh.

1382
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,070
Sorry for being so slow, you guys!

1383
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:29,750
I'm just scared!

1384
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:30,610
I'm scared!

1385
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,030
I'm scared!

1386
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,430
So close.

1387
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:35,170
Isn't that right?

1388
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:38,770
Okay.

1389
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,050
Let's go to the tower.

1390
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:55,730
Okay.

1391
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,530
Oh, dang it.

1392
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,210
I thought I made it.

1393
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:00,730
Oh.

1394
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,010
Up, up, up, up.

1395
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,180
Okay.

1396
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,100
Whew.

1397
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,440
Small steps.

1398
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,220
You've got this.

1399
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,100
I just don't know how far away they'll notice me at all.

1400
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,040
So that's why I'm...

1401
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:14,820
I'm such an...

1402
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,060
I'm overly cautious all the time, you guys.

1403
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,980
Because if I'm not overly cautious, it never works in my favor.

1404
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:22,620
I'm such a...

1405
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:22,820
Okay.

1406
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:32,590
I just came here from ERB Stream.

1407
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:33,010
Hello!

1408
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,390
I was watching her stream earlier too.

1409
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,450
Gosh, she is such a...

1410
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:39,130
Oh my god.

1411
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,410
Her singing...

1412
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:41,070
I was like thinking...

1413
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:42,210
The first time I heard her sing...

1414
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:44,650
I was like, all I want to hear...

1415
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:48,770
Is her do a cover of...

1416
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:49,930
Of...

1417
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,290
What's it called?

1418
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,340
Woh, ho!

1419
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:57,340
Oh!

1420
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,300
No, that's Snake Eater.

1421
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:00,920
But that too.

1422
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,420
She's got such an amazing, incredible voice.

1423
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,440
This is so awesome.

1424
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,980
Sins of the Father!

1425
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:13,700
Yes, thank you.

1426
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:18,560
Yes, I want to hear her cover Sins of the Father.

1427
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:24,740
This is where... like this area is.

1428
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,080
Down there.

1429
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,040
But the boat doesn't go over there.

1430
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,660
You think we can make it if we jump?

1431
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,920
I don't think so.

1432
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,380
I have such tiny legs.

1433
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,600
I'm a small, small alien.

1434
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,980
But yeah, if anybody's coming in...

1435
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:46,840
This is DLC of a game and we're kind of like in the middle of it.

1436
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,240
So if you don't stick around, that's all good.

1437
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,780
But if you want to watch from the beginning...

1438
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,860
That's good too.

1439
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,060
Yes, this is it!

1440
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,100
This is where the hole is.

1441
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,580
I'm going to jump.

1442
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,260
That was like the eggs and bacon alarm.

1443
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,380
For real.

1444
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:34,210
I guess I'll go back in.

1445
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:38,530
I don't think we have so much time left, but...

1446
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:39,470
I'll try again.

1447
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,920
I think we can make it this time.

1448
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,380
Something's a skill issue, right?

1449
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,860
But we know...

1450
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:07,000
We know that there are guys walking around in here as well.

1451
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:07,820
Thanks for...

1452
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,720
Over two months may help your well.

1453
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,480
Thank you!

1454
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,880
Thank you...

1455
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,500
Gin?

1456
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,540
Jin?

1457
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,340
Thank you so much.

1458
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,230
We know they're walking around in here.

1459
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,270
Oh, why aren't you going to the show, huh?

1460
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,320
Wait, so this...

1461
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:35,820
This...

1462
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,120
We know this one has an alarm down here.

1463
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,740
I remember the alarm down here.

1464
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,720
But I think if I just keep my thing off...

1465
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,000
Wait, is it over here?

1466
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,220
I think if I...

1467
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:56,980
Okay,

1468
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:00,890
here we go.

1469
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,730
I literally can't see anything.

1470
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,360
I can see the night sky and that's about it.

1471
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,110
I can see black.

1472
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:28,490
You can see the night sky?

1473
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:29,830
The...

1474
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:31,150
That planet?

1475
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,370
I think I'm going the right way.

1476
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:48,210
Oh.

1477
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:49,150
This way?

1478
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,390
I can't tell if I turned around or not.

1479
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:55,730
I can't tell anything.

1480
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:57,230
What's that?

1481
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,150
Whoosh.

1482
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:03,830
Oh.

1483
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:05,390
I'm right next to it.

1484
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:06,570
I thought I was across.

1485
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:07,470
Oh.

1486
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,690
Oh.

1487
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:09,850
Oh.

1488
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:11,910
Oh.

1489
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:12,050
Oh.

1490
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:18,940
Hello.

1491
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:26,830
Hmm.

1492
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:27,390
Cool.

1493
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:28,370
Uh...

1494
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,090
What's this way?

1495
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,570
Maybe it's a bad idea to head towards the light, but...

1496
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:41,450
A steerable boat.

1497
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:42,030
Yeah, you're...

1498
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:42,490
Whoa.

1499
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,430
This place is really...

1500
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,810
Is this like...

1501
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,010
The...

1502
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:50,950
What's it called?

1503
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:51,210
Place?

1504
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:55,350
Where they had all the worship of the eye.

1505
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,270
Oh.

1506
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:57,370
Ooh.

1507
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:57,930
Don't fall in.

1508
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,290
So it's...

1509
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:02,530
There's also an equivalent here.

1510
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:06,130
What's this?

1511
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:08,190
Oh.

1512
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:08,410
Oh.

1513
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:09,010
Oh.

1514
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:09,710
No.

1515
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:10,350
No.

1516
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:10,730
Please.

1517
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:11,030
No.

1518
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:11,830
I just got here.

1519
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,370
Oh my goodness.

1520
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,370
How do I get out of here?

1521
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:22,990
Let me out, please.

1522
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,790
Oh.

1523
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:25,770
We're just about...

1524
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,030
I didn't hear a screech there.

1525
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:27,190
What is this time?

1526
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:31,150
What the...

1527
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,030
What is this?

1528
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:38,870
Oh, wait.

1529
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:39,990
This is to get inside.

1530
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:40,630
Just kidding.

1531
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,610
There is a screech.

1532
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:48,210
Just kind of faded.

1533
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:48,830
Ah, okay.

1534
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:49,870
Hello?

1535
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:52,290
There we go.

1536
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:55,410
Hmm.

1537
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,030
Okay.

1538
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:57,290
Hmm.

1539
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:00,630
Hmm.

1540
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:04,210
So we were over there, technically.

1541
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:05,330
Kind of.

1542
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:09,560
We...

1543
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,200
Trying to think of where...

1544
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,080
Is this the...

1545
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,360
This is the place...

1546
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,200
That...

1547
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,500
I'm trying to wake up in.

1548
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,720
Right here.

1549
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:21,920
I believe.

1550
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:22,360
I believe...

1551
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,580
That is what I think I have to do.

1552
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:24,580
Because I think I...

1553
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,000
Have to wake up here.

1554
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,480
Lord Dredd, welcome to the membership.

1555
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:27,920
Thank you.

1556
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:28,300
Oh.

1557
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:28,480
Oh.

1558
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:34,200
Because I'm assuming this is like a one-to-one creation of their world.

1559
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:35,820
Right?

1560
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:36,800
I mean...

1561
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,020
That would make sense.

1562
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,680
And so...

1563
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,140
You...

1564
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:42,740
We were here.

1565
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,020
Because we came from here.

1566
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,100
We went this...

1567
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:45,540
Here.

1568
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,020
Right?

1569
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:46,440
Maybe?

1570
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,120
I don't know.

1571
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,400
Why?

1572
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,300
Is everyone saluting?

1573
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,500
You'll see...

1574
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,960
In like...

1575
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,300
Maybe one minute.

1576
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,480
Oh.

1577
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:57,900
Oh.

1578
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:58,240
Oh.

1579
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:58,380
Oh.

1580
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:58,480
Oh.

1581
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,800
Some stuff is the same.

1582
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,260
Yeah.

1583
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,070
Where is the sun anyway?

1584
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,400
Uh...

1585
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:22,620
Hello?

1586
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,120
You could have definitely given me more time in there, tower.

1587
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,670
The AI summary just called you blind.

1588
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:34,310
What?

1589
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,300
Nandato.

1590
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:45,230
Hmm.

1591
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:45,570
Oh.

1592
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,520
I know you can see the sun.

1593
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:00,520
Actually...

1594
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:00,720
Okay.

1595
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,060
Hold on.

1596
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:08,140
You can see the sun and stuff at the very beginning when you enter it.

1597
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,660
But remember we got that diagram of the planet thing moving away?

1598
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,500
So I wonder if we've been moving this whole time like away from the sun.

1599
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,920
But then why do we die?

1600
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,100
A dense forest along the banks of a river.

1601
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,320
I heard music coming from a camera.

1602
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,640
A man who's trying to handle it building across the water.

1603
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:34,220
Found a covered bridge leading to the darkest part of the forest.

1604
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:35,920
Wait.

1605
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,380
It doesn't say...

1606
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,260
That there's like...

1607
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,640
Anything else to see here.

1608
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:41,900
So...

1609
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,540
But I'm so curious what's going on in the...

1610
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,840
In the building.

1611
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:59,000
Because the ash twin project sends the information back in time and gets destroyed.

1612
01:17:59,260 --> 01:17:59,460
Hmmm.

1613
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:02,580
Yes.

1614
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,380
Okay, yes.

1615
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,000
Ash Twin Project always sends your memory back.

1616
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:10,400
Okay.

1617
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:12,040
That makes... that... yes.

1618
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,600
Oh, whoop.

1619
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,040
This one.

1620
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,820
There's more to explore here.

1621
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,840
But there's not more to explore here.

1622
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:33,900
So...

1623
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:44,210
Don't trust the logs.

1624
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:46,630
There are a bunch of logs that don't trigger more to explore.

1625
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:47,770
Dang it.

1626
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:50,990
So you're telling me I have to go to the show?

1627
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,970
I have to... be brave.

1628
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:55,750
Is that what you're saying?

1629
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:01,630
But... let's go back here.

1630
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:02,830
To the tower.

1631
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,970
Because I'm quite curious about...

1632
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:07,330
Whoop.

1633
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:07,770
Wait.

1634
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,210
How did... hold on.

1635
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:09,930
How did we get there?

1636
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,450
I'm already losing it.

1637
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:14,070
Okay.

1638
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,460
I'm curious what you just missed.

1639
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,960
I'm curious about so many things.

1640
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,080
I'm curious about everything that's going on.

1641
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:29,660
Ahem.

1642
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,600
There's more to explore here.

1643
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,060
It's very scary though.

1644
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,200
Okay.

1645
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,460
Maybe I should go back.

1646
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:44,800
Okay.

1647
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,640
I'm gonna try the show.

1648
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,280
I'm gonna try the show.

1649
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,180
I'm gonna try the show.

1650
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,160
Oh god.

1651
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,880
You guys!

1652
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,280
I'm scared though!

1653
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:55,800
I'm scared!

1654
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,140
I'm scared!

1655
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,620
I'm scared!

1656
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,800
But I'm scared.

1657
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,240
I'm scared to try the show.

1658
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,340
I'm scared to try the show.

1659
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:06,740
Oh.

1660
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,020
Oh.

1661
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,300
Oh.

1662
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:07,580
Oh.

1663
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,380
There we go.

1664
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:10,800
See?

1665
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,960
We can see the sun right now.

1666
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,260
I think we're moving.

1667
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:22,040
I think this thing is like... saying sayonara to everywhere.

1668
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,000
Be brave, Minto.

1669
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:29,500
Can I turn on baby mode?

1670
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,060
How is turning on baby mode a spoiler?

1671
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,440
If...

1672
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,340
Oh.

1673
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:40,680
Oops.

1674
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:41,760
If...

1675
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,100
You could do it from the very beginning.

1676
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:46,900
You know?

1677
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,400
That's all my questions.

1678
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,640
No babies here.

1679
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,440
There is!

1680
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,260
I'm a big baby!

1681
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:55,860
Cuckoo!

1682
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,280
Cuckoo Gaga.

1683
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,080
I've returned the baby.

1684
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:12,360
Knowing what it does is a spoiler.

1685
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,060
This is so messed up.

1686
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,200
This is so messed up of you all.

1687
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:23,050
This is so messed up!

1688
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:28,910
You can't know what the baby mode does because it's a spoiler.

1689
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,390
Too bad you're so afraid.

1690
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:33,570
Then how do I know what I'm turning?

1691
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,730
I wouldn't even know what I'm turning off.

1692
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:37,810
Thank

1693
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:45,470
you.

1694
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:45,670
Chu.

1695
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:47,830
Chu.

1696
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:50,570
Thank you.

1697
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:55,690
My mantra to be brave is what's the worst that can happen?

1698
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,990
And it'll be less scary the second time.

1699
01:21:58,930 --> 01:21:59,890
That is true.

1700
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:01,370
That is true.

1701
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:03,170
It'll be less scary the second time.

1702
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:06,430
I don't believe in what's the worst that can happen though.

1703
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:08,630
Because... I don't know.

1704
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,170
I don't want to get jumpscared.

1705
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:11,650
Jeffrey!

1706
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:14,290
We needed to make people aware of it.

1707
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:15,950
So that they knew what they were getting into.

1708
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:17,110
Okay.

1709
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:21,450
Also yes, the way it works is a spoiler.

1710
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,270
Stop!

1711
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:24,730
Jeffrey!

1712
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,910
Gosh, I'm so...

1713
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:30,430
I'm so scared.

1714
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:31,350
No!

1715
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:34,310
No!

1716
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:36,070
Okay.

1717
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:37,650
Um...

1718
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:39,070
There was like a hand.

1719
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,210
There was a grabby grab.

1720
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,770
Is it this way that we...

1721
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:44,910
That goes to the grabby grab?

1722
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:47,990
No.

1723
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:49,510
This is...

1724
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:51,310
Wait, I went to the right place, right?

1725
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:53,450
Yeah.

1726
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,050
Say hi to them.

1727
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:56,610
What's the worst?

1728
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:57,030
You die?

1729
01:22:58,930 --> 01:22:59,450
That's alright.

1730
01:22:59,550 --> 01:22:59,950
I've already...

1731
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:02,670
I've already gone through that once.

1732
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,140
We'll tell you once you're ready to know.

1733
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,500
Okay, okay.

1734
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,360
No, don't open that.

1735
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,800
Because we're not going on the boat.

1736
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:14,360
Oh wait!

1737
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,800
I could go on the boat.

1738
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,800
No.

1739
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:19,820
I don't think I can.

1740
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,460
I don't think I can go on the boat actually.

1741
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,380
Because it doesn't stop.

1742
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:27,960
By...

1743
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:30,180
Yeah, there it is over there.

1744
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,360
Okay.

1745
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,080
Where's the grabby grab?

1746
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:39,290
But we'll start seeing them.

1747
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,290
We'll start seeing them.

1748
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:40,470
Alright.

1749
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,750
Be brave, Minto.

1750
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:46,670
I'm not really that brave, you guys.

1751
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,790
You seem to mostly fear the unknown.

1752
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:50,930
I fear a lot of the...

1753
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:51,750
I just...

1754
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:52,590
I fear Murphy.

1755
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:53,210
I fear.

1756
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,870
I fear...

1757
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,370
I fear.

1758
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:07,170
I can't find the grabby grab so I might have to just do...

1759
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:08,810
Wait a second.

1760
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,570
Did I see...

1761
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:11,590
Oh no.

1762
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:12,410
This is where we went.

1763
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:12,590
Yeah.

1764
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,250
I just fear!

1765
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:17,450
There they are.

1766
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:18,050
They're walking.

1767
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:22,010
They're already heading over.

1768
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:32,130
Uh...

1769
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:32,450
Wait.

1770
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:33,590
Here we go.

1771
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,340
Do you think they'll see me from over here?

1772
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:47,410
Do you fear me now?

1773
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:47,870
Never.

1774
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,440
But...

1775
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,320
I can't tell if they see me or not.

1776
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:57,520
Are they...

1777
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:58,960
Oh.

1778
01:24:59,180 --> 01:24:59,600
Oh.

1779
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,200
I just felt my controller rumble which means that a lec...

1780
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,020
Whatever thing that happened here just happened.

1781
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,240
Okay.

1782
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:09,640
They're gone.

1783
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:14,540
They're not gone.

1784
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,000
You think they'll see me?

1785
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,080
Look at them!

1786
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:18,880
Wow!

1787
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,260
Ooh!

1788
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,080
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

1789
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,280
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

1790
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,080
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

1791
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,200
They see me.

1792
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:38,680
That's me walking.

1793
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,340
So they know, they think I'm one of them, right?

1794
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,120
They think I'm one of them, probably.

1795
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,280
Probably.

1796
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,080
Oh boy.

1797
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:56,350
You're kinda short.

1798
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:58,010
Act natural.

1799
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:00,530
I'm acting natural, I'm acting natural, I'm acting natural.

1800
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,260
I'm just gonna have to follow him, I think.

1801
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,400
As they say, there's no fear, but the fear of tigers.

1802
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,830
Has she made any progress?

1803
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:33,850
That's so rude!

1804
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:35,010
I have made progress!

1805
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,090
What are you talking about?

1806
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,710
I've made progress, right guys?

1807
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:55,690
I think I'm on their pathway.

1808
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:56,230
Uh oh.

1809
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:57,930
Time to go.

1810
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,680
Don't fall too close behind.

1811
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,500
Okay, here we go, here we go.

1812
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:45,650
I'm one of you guys!

1813
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:15,800
You rude!

1814
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,100
I was here for the show!

1815
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,280
I just wanted to see you!

1816
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,980
Not invited.

1817
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:34,720
Oh my god!

1818
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,020
You finally did so good!

1819
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:37,740
Thank you!

1820
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,860
Didn't buy a ticket.

1821
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,860
Yeah, they're really cute, actually.

1822
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,680
I thought, like, I thought something scarier would happen.

1823
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,980
They were really confused, though.

1824
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,840
They were like, um...

1825
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,240
What the hell?

1826
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,920
They were really confused, I think.

1827
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:01,560
Can I go back?

1828
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,380
You think they'll let me in this time?

1829
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:05,220
Hey, I'm... I'm back, man!

1830
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,160
Private party.

1831
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:09,420
Private party.

1832
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,240
Literally, the jazz music stops me.

1833
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:21,720
Think they'll let me in this time, or...

1834
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:26,980
But, like, I don't think there's anything I can really explore in there, because they'll...

1835
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,320
They're gonna be walk... They're just gonna get me again.

1836
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,780
So I think I have to go past...

1837
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,320
And go to the next floor.

1838
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,760
I'm just one of you guys.

1839
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,140
I'm just one of you guys.

1840
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:05,830
I don't remember where the entrance was.

1841
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:06,650
Uh-oh.

1842
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:07,690
I'm gonna get got.

1843
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:09,330
Don't get me, please.

1844
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:10,810
I'm one of you guys.

1845
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:12,530
Come into your meeting.

1846
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:17,110
I have your little candle and everything, okay?

1847
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,630
They're just jealous I'm alive.

1848
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:29,710
Mm-hmm.

1849
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,560
Breathe on their lantern.

1850
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:37,780
That's so messed up.

1851
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,700
You are alive?

1852
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,440
In the game.

1853
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:51,880
Sorry.

1854
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:05,090
Oh, I forgot.

1855
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:07,790
Alright, to the tower we go.

1856
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:09,890
Oh, jeez.

1857
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:17,790
Okay, to the tower we go, everybody.

1858
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:27,800
Okay.

1859
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,600
Let's get around this little tree here.

1860
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:38,960
There is that other tree that has, like...

1861
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,260
I haven't seen, like, such a tree here.

1862
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:47,020
Mysterious.

1863
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,800
Everything is so mysterious.

1864
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,980
Oh, I was trying to avoid this rock, but, you know...

1865
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:55,300
Okay.

1866
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:00,470
Oh!

1867
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,700
Unless... wait, it was... hold on.

1868
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,180
It was in this tower, wasn't it?

1869
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:14,760
No...

1870
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:20,480
Like, where we saw it was what I mean.

1871
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,920
It's this one, right?

1872
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:24,220
Yep.

1873
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:30,350
What was in the tower?

1874
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:33,810
The, um... the mural that we saw.

1875
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:37,290
That may be a misremembering.

1876
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,530
You mean the tree?

1877
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:41,510
The tree mural, yeah.

1878
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:44,890
Okay, goodnight.

1879
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:52,790
So now that I know that they're not gonna be so mean to me...

1880
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:54,770
They were so confused.

1881
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:56,370
They were just staring like...

1882
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:03,430
They were so confused.

1883
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:11,210
It's kind of funny.

1884
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:13,590
Oh yeah, here we can go.

1885
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,150
That's right.

1886
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:20,650
Ignore you.

1887
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:28,500
There was the burnt house down here.

1888
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:33,450
Fear conquered.

1889
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:37,230
I wouldn't quite say that, but, you know, I'm doing my best.

1890
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:39,210
Okay.

1891
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:42,510
Let's try and go to the...

1892
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:45,450
left side this time.

1893
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,320
I know from here that I can...

1894
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,720
Okay, I think we're good.

1895
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:03,160
Let's try going...

1896
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,380
Wait, will it let me go?

1897
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,700
I don't think...

1898
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,040
I think I can only steer it back and forward this way and this way.

1899
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,500
Yeah, so I can't like...

1900
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,440
take it to another spot.

1901
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,480
Just imagine a random alien showing up in a...

1902
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,500
They're all just staring at me.

1903
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:25,760
Okay, so we're back here at the burnt mural.

1904
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,220
Anything else here of significance?

1905
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,600
We have this thing up here.

1906
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,140
The boat is on rails.

1907
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,420
Ah, that makes sense.

1908
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:35,540
Like, what is...

1909
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:35,740
This!

1910
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:39,160
Before...

1911
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:47,090
It's like...

1912
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,670
It's almost like a...

1913
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:52,170
binocular.

1914
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:55,590
There's nothing else over here, actually.

1915
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,130
I'm looking around.

1916
01:34:59,490 --> 01:34:59,990
No!

1917
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:02,470
Hmm.

1918
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,030
Yeah, binoculars.

1919
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:08,790
I kept wanting to say magnifying glass.

1920
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:11,970
Magnifying glass for far things away.

1921
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:14,710
But I can't use it.

1922
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:16,370
Too short.

1923
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:18,830
Too short.

1924
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:19,670
Okay.

1925
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:20,430
Whatever.

1926
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:24,210
I think that's the only stuff over around here.

1927
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:24,970
Oh.

1928
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,370
Maybe.

1929
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:30,510
Possibly.

1930
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,550
Okay.

1931
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:35,270
There is something else.

1932
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:35,790
There is?

1933
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,750
Smelloscope.

1934
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:43,150
There's something else here?

1935
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:46,130
You were just by it!

1936
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:46,610
I was?

1937
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:47,470
Who?

1938
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:50,650
Blind Minto.

1939
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:53,950
I keep almost falling into the water.

1940
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,550
This thing.

1941
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:54,850
Ah!

1942
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:56,550
I didn't realize it could open!

1943
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:58,310
Oh!

1944
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,410
Oh!

1945
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:02,730
What?

1946
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:06,270
What does this mean?

1947
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:09,790
This tiny flower is producing...

1948
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,530
Well, I say tiny.

1949
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:13,350
This flower is producing galaxies.

1950
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,060
Okay.

1951
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:21,620
What?

1952
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,600
Yeah, see?

1953
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,600
There's the eye symbols.

1954
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,100
Yeah, they also liked that.

1955
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:29,160
It's really interesting.

1956
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:37,320
That these guys have the same symbol for the eye and then Nonomai also have the same symbol for the eye.

1957
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:41,100
I find that a little fascinating.

1958
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:45,920
Wait.

1959
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:46,080
Wait.

1960
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:46,300
Wait.

1961
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:46,560
Wait.

1962
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:46,740
Wait.

1963
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:46,900
Wait.

1964
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:47,200
Yeah.

1965
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:47,920
Don't leave.

1966
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,420
Don't leave.

1967
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,060
Very convenient.

1968
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,020
I don't know if convenient is the word.

1969
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:54,840
But, you know.

1970
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:02,340
Yeah.

1971
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:04,220
I can't go any further because of this rock.

1972
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:10,640
So, let's go.

1973
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:11,480
Is this the thing that goes off?

1974
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,400
Here we go.

1975
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:23,660
Nice.

1976
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,520
Well, then.

1977
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:34,100
Let's explore as much and more that we can before we get kicked out.

1978
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:40,250
There's a hand.

1979
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:41,790
Yeah.

1980
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:44,010
Let's go to the other side.

1981
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:49,930
I can't remember exactly everything that we hit on this area.

1982
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:52,210
But, I do know that there's something here.

1983
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:52,810
I do know how...

1984
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:53,610
I do want...

1985
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:55,070
I do know we need to get down there.

1986
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,320
Oh, that's where we can...

1987
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,080
Oh.

1988
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:11,280
Maybe that's how we get down there.

1989
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:13,720
Okay.

1990
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:19,620
Okay.

1991
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,540
Loop done.

1992
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:25,730
Let's go meditate.

1993
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:29,010
Okay.

1994
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:29,730
Okay.

1995
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,650
Let's meditate.

1996
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:33,730
You know what?

1997
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:34,790
We'll meditate in the water.

1998
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:43,530
It's always so spooky how the world turns sideways before we know, right?

1999
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:45,590
So funny.

2000
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:49,650
I gotta go to the bathroom and I'm gonna go check on my cat, if that's okay?

2001
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:50,810
With you guys?

2002
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:55,790
He's been eating a little bit more, so...

2003
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:57,970
But I've just been checking on him.

2004
01:38:57,970 --> 01:39:00,470
He's been mostly kind of laying under the bed.

2005
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:05,850
So I've just been kind of leaving him alone.

2006
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:11,030
I have a doctor's appointment for him tomorrow.

2007
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:13,510
And I...

2008
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:17,810
How can I give you some music before I go fishing?

2009
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,030
I don't wanna waste the time.

2010
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:22,490
You know what?

2011
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,550
I'll just waste the time.

2012
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:24,610
You guys can have the music.

2013
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:25,910
And the ASMR.

2014
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:27,270
And then we'll just reset.

2015
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:29,030
When I'm back.

2016
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:30,910
Okay.

2017
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:31,650
I'll be right back.

2018
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:13,760
Okay, I fed him.

2019
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:16,420
And I went to the bathroom.

2020
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,280
And I forgot to get more tea.

2021
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,620
So I'm gonna go get more tea.

2022
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:23,940
And then I'll be back for realsies.

2023
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,800
Then I'll be back for realsies.

2024
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:26,100
Okay.

2025
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,960
Give me like two more minutes.

2026
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,260
Winky Splanky.

2027
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:03,060
Okay.

2028
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:03,940
Who's gonna win?

2029
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:04,780
What are you talking about?

2030
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:05,600
Okay.

2031
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:06,780
You guys.

2032
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:09,040
What's going on?

2033
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:11,800
I went into...

2034
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,160
Into...

2035
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,420
What's the word mode?

2036
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:15,400
There we go.

2037
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:17,980
Okay.

2038
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:18,920
Meditate.

2039
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:22,340
Welcome back, boys.

2040
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,360
Thank you.

2041
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,160
Thank you.

2042
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:25,500
Thank you.

2043
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:26,700
Are you winning, Min?

2044
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:27,440
I think so.

2045
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:28,880
I think so.

2046
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,680
I'm gonna start by picking at a walkthrough.

2047
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:36,200
Okay, I'll be...

2048
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,540
I'm gonna have 100% transparency here.

2049
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,380
I didn't look at a walkthrough.

2050
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,460
But I asked a friend to look at a walkthrough.

2051
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:48,580
I was like, okay, can you look at a walkthrough and just give me a hint?

2052
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,640
Don't tell me the answer.

2053
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,040
I have to...

2054
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,700
I have to look at the...

2055
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:56,520
And they...

2056
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,500
They didn't.

2057
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,860
If anything, they did.

2058
01:46:58,860 --> 01:46:59,100
Really?

2059
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,220
They were just like, I don't know where you're at.

2060
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:04,500
I was like, no, just like... I was like, just look for...

2061
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:10,900
I was like, look for something that says the hidden vault seal.

2062
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:13,680
And they were like, I don't know.

2063
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:15,340
I can't find anything.

2064
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,300
I was like, don't tell me the answer.

2065
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:24,340
Just give me like a one word hint.

2066
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,840
What I should do.

2067
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:34,310
And so... Mint, that's cheating.

2068
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:36,830
I didn't get any help, so...

2069
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:38,390
You know...

2070
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:40,290
Let's go back to the Starlit Cove.

2071
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:44,290
I give up on the show.

2072
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:48,690
For now, at least.

2073
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:50,730
I want to have more time at the Cove.

2074
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:54,490
She tried to cheat.

2075
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:55,490
No, I didn't try to cheat.

2076
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:58,370
I just wanted a little hint because you guys weren't giving me anything.

2077
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:04,430
You guys weren't giving me anything.

2078
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:06,510
I'm so... I'm so lost.

2079
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:11,850
We're going to be here all day.

2080
01:48:12,110 --> 01:48:12,570
That's okay.

2081
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:17,650
We're going to be here all day, you guys.

2082
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:18,750
All day.

2083
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:24,910
I have to wake up so early for my cat, but you guys don't care.

2084
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:26,870
You're just like, no help.

2085
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:31,750
You guys are like, doesn't matter.

2086
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:32,530
No help.

2087
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:40,440
To the tower, to the tower.

2088
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:42,780
To the tower, to the tower.

2089
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:46,680
Ask chat to be...

2090
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,480
The hint is explore more.

2091
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:53,820
Well, that's what I'm doing.

2092
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,780
We're going to the tower to explore some more.

2093
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:10,790
Since I also don't have the... Well, I maybe... I'm not going to say anything because I will eat my words.

2094
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:12,290
You know what?

2095
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:12,630
Never mind.

2096
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:13,370
I'm just going to shut up.

2097
01:49:14,110 --> 01:49:15,110
Just going to shut up.

2098
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:17,650
Oh, the artifact.

2099
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:22,410
I think we can get one over here as well.

2100
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:23,270
Right?

2101
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:24,710
Oh, wait.

2102
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:25,510
No, I don't think we can.

2103
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:27,690
Oh, you guys, I think I just messed up.

2104
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:29,950
Wait, I think I just remembered that there's no artifact.

2105
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:32,250
Yeah, there's no artifact here, is there?

2106
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:34,490
Okay,

2107
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:42,120
we're going to another place.

2108
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,180
There's one in the tower hidden room.

2109
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:48,280
Just kidding, we're not going to another place.

2110
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:50,280
Turn around, turn around.

2111
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,320
Oh, the water is too strong.

2112
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,180
Wait, the water is really strong here.

2113
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:55,400
Oh, here we go, here we go.

2114
01:49:56,540 --> 01:49:58,860
I think slowly but surely we can do it.

2115
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,280
Come on, come on, come on, team.

2116
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:02,340
Come on, team.

2117
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,760
Team, team, team, team.

2118
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,020
There we go, there we go.

2119
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,140
Power, power, power.

2120
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,220
Power, power, power, power, power.

2121
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:13,260
Power, power, power, power, power.

2122
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:15,140
This way, this way.

2123
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:17,740
Slowly but surely we're making it.

2124
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:19,620
Oh, I don't know if we can make it.

2125
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:24,190
Whatever.

2126
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,460
Secret room.

2127
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,020
Wait, it's not?

2128
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,180
Which secret room?

2129
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:47,860
The one down there?

2130
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,300
Did I get one guide?

2131
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:52,920
Did I get one guide?

2132
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,360
For realsies?

2133
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:56,740
Did you just one guide me?

2134
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:18,180
Why are you spreading lies on the internet?

2135
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:23,600
Why are you spreading lies?

2136
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,180
The meditative shame.

2137
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:32,810
Why are you spreading lies on the internet?

2138
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:34,790
How could you do that?

2139
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:38,030
How could you say that and then feel good about yourself?

2140
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:42,770
That's what you get for reading chat?

2141
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:45,250
I don't think it's very...

2142
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:46,030
Okay, come on.

2143
01:51:46,110 --> 01:51:46,930
I don't think it's...

2144
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:51,270
Telling me where an artifact is is not the same as telling me how to do a puzzle.

2145
01:51:51,410 --> 01:51:52,570
It's completely different.

2146
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,160
To the stranger.

2147
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:06,690
Whoa, we're moving sideways.

2148
01:52:06,690 --> 01:52:07,690
Ha ha.

2149
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,130
Me after spreading misinformation?

2150
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:14,310
I think it means streamer.

2151
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:17,650
I just made it so that the streamer...

2152
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:24,650
had to do something and then go out of there way, and then it didn't matter in the end.

2153
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:30,210
I just disrupted the stream and I made my mark in this stream forever.

2154
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:35,950
I just disrupted the streamer and they're angry about it.

2155
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:38,930
I just made them angry.

2156
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:40,430
Perfect.

2157
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:48,270
I think the streamer is going to have a horrible day after this.

2158
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:53,590
I think the streamer is going to think about this all night.

2159
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:58,970
The streamer is going to be thinking about me and how much I give them the wrong information.

2160
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:03,750
I think I'm going to do it again next week.

2161
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:08,170
You.

2162
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:13,830
Your inconvenience is nourishment.

2163
01:53:15,630 --> 01:53:16,470
Get in there.

2164
01:53:16,630 --> 01:53:17,370
There we go.

2165
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:28,490
Minecraft rules.

2166
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:30,770
Real laugh.

2167
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:34,590
Oh my goodness.

2168
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:37,210
There we go.

2169
01:53:42,910 --> 01:53:43,310
Alright.

2170
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:44,610
Let's get out of here.

2171
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:45,970
Skedaddle-addle.

2172
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:51,070
She's so obsessed with me now.

2173
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:56,370
Give the streamer wrong information once.

2174
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:58,290
I'll be obsessed with you forever.

2175
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:00,030
Wait.

2176
01:54:00,150 --> 01:54:00,410
Oh.

2177
01:54:00,490 --> 01:54:01,030
This way.

2178
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:03,230
We're going to the tower.

2179
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:06,210
I don't feel like going to the show anymore.

2180
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:09,490
I have to go back to the show though, don't I?

2181
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:12,890
Eventually, I have to go back to the show.

2182
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:22,710
This is a terrible place to leave.

2183
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:45,010
Okay.

2184
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:46,290
Don't stop, please.

2185
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:48,290
Push.

2186
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:50,310
You got it.

2187
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:51,610
No!

2188
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:52,130
No!

2189
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:00,450
This way.

2190
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:03,750
This way.

2191
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:05,150
This way.

2192
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:08,450
I like when the music starts back up.

2193
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:09,870
Like I know I'm doing something correct.

2194
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:12,990
Okay.

2195
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,270
No, no, no.

2196
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:15,830
Ouch.

2197
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:17,490
Okay.

2198
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:19,050
That's fine.

2199
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,330
Just get me out of here.

2200
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,260
What is wrong with this boat?

2201
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:26,020
It's defective.

2202
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,400
And don't say it's the driver.

2203
01:55:38,410 --> 01:55:39,430
It's the driver.

2204
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:42,290
I said not to say that.

2205
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,720
It's the captain.

2206
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:51,580
Stop.

2207
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:02,070
It's the streamer.

2208
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:03,250
It's the steersman.

2209
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:09,550
There's still this hole.

2210
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:10,190
Wait a second.

2211
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,320
I'm picking up something else.

2212
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:16,780
My bad.

2213
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:19,300
Okay.

2214
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:24,040
Good night, everybody.

2215
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:26,560
I feel really like we're all close friends now.

2216
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,000
But they're not zombies at all.

2217
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:32,400
They were very much alive guys.

2218
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,000
They looked pretty cute.

2219
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:35,920
Just like the pictures.

2220
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:38,040
Also, how do I get down here?

2221
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:38,760
Hmm.

2222
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:50,780
Yeah, I thought they were pretty cute.

2223
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,160
You didn't think so?

2224
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:52,500
Okay.

2225
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:55,220
Get up.

2226
01:56:55,220 --> 01:57:02,380
Also, when I jumped from here, the alarm went off, so we're gonna have to not get caught again.

2227
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:07,940
We're gonna have to be sneaky about the boat controls.

2228
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,220
In IT, we have an acronym for a common bug.

2229
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:12,380
HEC-KAC.

2230
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,920
The problem is it exists because it's a chair and keyboard.

2231
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:17,320
Oh, what are you trying to say?

2232
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:19,580
You think he's in here?

2233
01:57:26,930 --> 01:57:31,570
So then, what are you trying to say?

2234
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:33,690
There's a thing there.

2235
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:35,750
Okay.

2236
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:44,700
They're probably like, hey man, you can't open up the thing.

2237
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:47,300
I'm like being such a nuisance here.

2238
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:50,700
Oh, I thought it would open the door.

2239
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:57,720
I'm being such a nuisance here, being like, I'm just gonna open your safe that you clearly don't want people using.

2240
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,160
They're like, hey, don't do that.

2241
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:02,660
I'm like, too bad.

2242
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:03,820
I'm gonna do what I want.

2243
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:04,340
I'm an alien.

2244
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:15,260
Hold on.

2245
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:17,420
There was another light.

2246
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:18,820
Let me light that one too.

2247
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:19,620
Let's see what happens.

2248
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:22,840
Oh, my controller just rumbled.

2249
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:25,960
So I believe that electricity thing just happened.

2250
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:54,100
Hmm.

2251
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,320
She forgor.

2252
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:00,500
What did I forgor?

2253
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,820
I don't have like my little guy anymore.

2254
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:10,820
I don't have my little scout anymore to shoot through.

2255
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:14,860
She knows, she just doesn't remember.

2256
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:17,260
I don't remember.

2257
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,860
Does anyone want to give me a...

2258
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,820
What did I forgor?

2259
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:24,820
I did, actually.

2260
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,360
I don't remember at all.

2261
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:29,980
What did I forgor?

2262
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:34,000
No elf, but it's something I knew before.

2263
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:36,000
This is so unfair.

2264
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,200
Why are you guys like this?

2265
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,540
This is so unfair.

2266
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:42,640
I already knew.

2267
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:46,980
Are these the flowers?

2268
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:09,560
Oh, yes.

2269
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:11,520
Yes.

2270
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:11,900
Yes.

2271
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:20,680
Because the light, the door is always open when there's no light.

2272
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:21,420
I remember.

2273
02:00:29,970 --> 02:00:31,170
Shut up.

2274
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:32,770
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

2275
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:36,010
Wait a second.

2276
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,920
Oh, my god.

2277
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:45,420
Tower stuff.

2278
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,100
Oh,

2279
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:01,400
my god.

2280
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,540
We're finally here.

2281
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:05,920
Oh, my god.

2282
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:06,300
Oh, my god.

2283
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:06,880
Oh, my god.

2284
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:14,530
Is this where...

2285
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:16,410
Oh, this is really, really tall.

2286
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:18,150
There's not going to be anyone here though, right?

2287
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:26,470
I think I have to extinguish these.

2288
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:33,750
Good night, sweet prince.

2289
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:36,650
Oh, oopsie.

2290
02:01:36,650 --> 02:01:37,190
Hahaha.

2291
02:01:38,030 --> 02:01:41,610
I think I extinguish these and then I go back to the other world.

2292
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,840
But also, what's up here?

2293
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:51,840
Oh.

2294
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:53,200
It's just the same.

2295
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:55,500
Yeah.

2296
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,340
Look at you guys.

2297
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,220
Drawing things with sunlight.

2298
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,380
Wait, what did that say?

2299
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:07,620
Oh, drop artifact.

2300
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:08,620
No, we're good.

2301
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:10,640
Okay.

2302
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:13,600
So that's how you get here.

2303
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:14,700
I cheese this part.

2304
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,240
What do you mean you cheese this part?

2305
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:17,280
How do you cheese this?

2306
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:21,400
How do you cheese this at all?

2307
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:24,720
But now we have the seals, right?

2308
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:26,440
But hold on.

2309
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:30,700
Before we jump into the water, I have something I want to do.

2310
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,180
Tool flip.

2311
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:32,980
Hold on.

2312
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:33,740
Hold on.

2313
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:33,920
Hold on.

2314
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:39,190
Oh, here.

2315
02:02:39,690 --> 02:02:41,590
There is something else on this side.

2316
02:02:43,570 --> 02:02:44,470
Is it a boat?

2317
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:51,430
Okay.

2318
02:02:52,690 --> 02:02:53,170
This.

2319
02:02:53,370 --> 02:02:54,650
Does this create a boat?

2320
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:56,690
It does.

2321
02:02:56,890 --> 02:02:57,490
Okay, never mind.

2322
02:02:58,490 --> 02:02:59,650
I don't need no boat.

2323
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:03,450
Mint changed her name?

2324
02:03:05,230 --> 02:03:06,530
I changed my name?

2325
02:03:06,730 --> 02:03:07,650
Who am I now?

2326
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:09,510
Wait, no.

2327
02:03:09,550 --> 02:03:10,070
I'm Minto.

2328
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:12,750
I'm Minto.

2329
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:15,250
What do you mean?

2330
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:16,570
I changed my name.

2331
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:21,580
Okay.

2332
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:23,040
I think we have to...

2333
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,880
Good morning, gamers.

2334
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:32,380
Alright, see you suckers.

2335
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:43,940
I don't know why I can jump out there, but I can't jump here.

2336
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:44,620
Okay.

2337
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:46,220
Into the secret.

2338
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:48,960
Tunnel?

2339
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:56,890
Oh my gosh.

2340
02:03:57,330 --> 02:03:59,890
Wait, we're gonna get the passwords, right?

2341
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:00,910
Maybe?

2342
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:02,830
And then...

2343
02:04:02,830 --> 02:04:04,770
What location was it?

2344
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:08,110
To unlock...

2345
02:04:08,110 --> 02:04:09,610
Oh, it was inside the thing.

2346
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:18,580
Yeah, inside the bell.

2347
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:20,000
Okay.

2348
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:25,370
Open!

2349
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:28,390
Uh-oh.

2350
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:29,630
Uh-oh.

2351
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:30,130
Uh-oh.

2352
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:30,570
Uh-oh.

2353
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:31,330
Uh-oh.

2354
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:32,670
Wow!

2355
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:38,810
Thank you.

2356
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:39,770
Open.

2357
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:43,250
Oh, come on!

2358
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:45,630
No, no.

2359
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:46,870
No, no.

2360
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:48,690
You guys suck!

2361
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:57,170
Oh, we're leaning.

2362
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:58,330
We're leaning, guys.

2363
02:04:58,330 --> 02:04:58,890
We're leaning.

2364
02:04:58,990 --> 02:05:00,270
Wait, which one was this one for?

2365
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:01,290
Oh, wait.

2366
02:05:01,390 --> 02:05:02,210
We've been here.

2367
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:04,030
This one, though.

2368
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:07,710
We know this cave.

2369
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:09,990
We know this cave.

2370
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:11,210
We know this cave.

2371
02:05:11,410 --> 02:05:14,510
It did a shiplog, but I'm screencapping it, too.

2372
02:05:15,650 --> 02:05:23,010
I'm screencapping it so that when we go back to the cave, I know what to do.

2373
02:05:23,190 --> 02:05:23,970
Okay, take a picture.

2374
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:25,010
Okay.

2375
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:26,810
New info!

2376
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:30,350
Can we even make it there, though?

2377
02:05:30,610 --> 02:05:32,730
Oh, you sons of...

2378
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:39,340
This is fine.

2379
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:40,860
This is good.

2380
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:43,800
This is fun.

2381
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,560
This is fun, everybody.

2382
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:47,320
This is okay.

2383
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:48,580
I told you.

2384
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:53,420
We're literally just messing up the... They're like, hey, we really... Like, it's bad...

2385
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:57,640
It's bad news bears if anybody messes with, uh...

2386
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:02,660
If anybody messes with this thing, and I'm just like, I don't care!

2387
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:04,780
And I do it anyway.

2388
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:14,460
Oh, wait.

2389
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,020
I can see the sun from here still.

2390
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:21,280
Hmm.

2391
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:22,680
Interesting.

2392
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:25,640
I thought we wouldn't be able to see the sun anymore.

2393
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:29,620
Okay.

2394
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:35,400
Um, let's go down, down, down by the river.

2395
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:38,740
It would be...

2396
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:39,560
Here, right?

2397
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:41,280
This is where the cave is at.

2398
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:46,540
I need that.

2399
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:47,580
I need that boat.

2400
02:06:57,620 --> 02:06:58,780
Do you think we can make it?

2401
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:00,620
Yeah, we can make it.

2402
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:03,420
I can make it.

2403
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:05,300
Oh, I'm trapped in the boat.

2404
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:06,800
Hold on.

2405
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:08,240
Boat, boat, boat, boat, boat.

2406
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:09,080
Boat, boat.

2407
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:12,680
There we go.

2408
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:13,160
Nice.

2409
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:14,100
Go, go, go!

2410
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:20,180
Cave was at the third area.

2411
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:23,900
This area right here, then.

2412
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:26,020
Instead.

2413
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,720
This one.

2414
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:29,780
No.

2415
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,840
That's not this one, is it?

2416
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:35,120
Maybe we can check.

2417
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,020
We're right here.

2418
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,180
Oh, the right side!

2419
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:46,470
Are you sure?

2420
02:07:48,290 --> 02:07:48,870
Oh, yes!

2421
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:51,210
Okay, we're going to loop.

2422
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:54,710
We're going to loop around.

2423
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:58,270
Because...

2424
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:01,770
I do want to try and get this if we can.

2425
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:03,730
We have a little extra time.

2426
02:08:04,370 --> 02:08:06,030
Push, push, push, push.

2427
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:07,050
Push, push.

2428
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:09,110
Wait, too much push, push!

2429
02:08:09,110 --> 02:08:09,190
Push!

2430
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:16,330
Because...

2431
02:08:19,470 --> 02:08:20,730
I'd like to...

2432
02:08:21,290 --> 02:08:22,530
Try and get it.

2433
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:30,440
We're making progress, guys.

2434
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:31,100
We're making progress.

2435
02:08:31,940 --> 02:08:32,680
Push, push.

2436
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,540
Yeah, this is the...

2437
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:37,520
This is the one that has the little...

2438
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,940
The artifact thing.

2439
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:43,340
The artifact thing.

2440
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:45,540
You guys pushing me in the right direction.

2441
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:47,700
Eek!

2442
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:48,920
When I...

2443
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:51,320
Wait!

2444
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:52,480
Come back!

2445
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:53,440
Okay.

2446
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:55,420
When I need it.

2447
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:00,360
Okay.

2448
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:09,020
Okay, okay.

2449
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,460
To the right.

2450
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:11,460
That way.

2451
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,280
That way.

2452
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:16,420
Artifact is right here.

2453
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:18,640
We got him.

2454
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:19,000
Don't worry.

2455
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:20,480
We got him.

2456
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:20,860
We got him.

2457
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:21,040
Right here.

2458
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:23,400
Actually, I'm gonna hold on to him just in case we lose our boat.

2459
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:24,120
For some reason.

2460
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:26,380
Okay.

2461
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:27,040
Stop.

2462
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:27,920
You're being too pushy.

2463
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:30,840
That's what you're supposed to...

2464
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:31,520
That's what Oshi means!

2465
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,440
Push!

2466
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,620
That's exactly what Oshi means!

2467
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:36,000
A push!

2468
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:38,220
Okay.

2469
02:09:42,230 --> 02:09:42,830
We got this.

2470
02:09:42,970 --> 02:09:43,290
We got this.

2471
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:43,690
We got this.

2472
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:52,480
Oh yeah.

2473
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:53,640
Oh...

2474
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:55,300
Oh...

2475
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:56,880
Oh yeah.

2476
02:09:57,380 --> 02:09:59,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2477
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:00,040
Go!

2478
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:00,240
This way.

2479
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:00,500
This way.

2480
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:00,780
This way.

2481
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:04,520
I don't even know if we can get inside it anymore, because everything's destroyed, but... oh.

2482
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,500
The elevator might work.

2483
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:11,300
We might be okay.

2484
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:16,300
The elevator...

2485
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,960
The elevator might work.

2486
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:20,300
Still.

2487
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,660
I think it works.

2488
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:23,740
Yeah!

2489
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:24,640
We're fine!

2490
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,040
Let's see...

2491
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:28,140
Yeah!

2492
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:35,940
I'm gonna Oshi my Oshi off this road.

2493
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:39,860
Getting a little violent here.

2494
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:40,400
It's okay.

2495
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,360
You're just excitable.

2496
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:42,880
I get it.

2497
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:51,370
Getting over to the other side...

2498
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:57,690
Getting over to the other side...

2499
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:00,350
I think we can make it.

2500
02:11:01,570 --> 02:11:02,470
Here we go.

2501
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:05,950
Nice.

2502
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:12,660
Big flip.

2503
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:17,120
Okay, okay, okay.

2504
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:21,940
Now what's so curious about this part is...

2505
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:25,780
I don't remember...

2506
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,360
I don't remember...

2507
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:39,020
Anything that looked like...

2508
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:53,780
I just never went over to the side.

2509
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:56,560
Wait a second!

2510
02:11:58,280 --> 02:11:59,980
This is how you get over here?

2511
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:01,280
This whole time?

2512
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:02,400
We could have done it so easily?

2513
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:07,760
Stop.

2514
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:08,000
Stop.

2515
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,360
It's not done yet, right?

2516
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:22,080
No, no, no.

2517
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:23,560
No, no, I just made it here.

2518
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:23,760
Please.

2519
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:24,680
No, no, no, no.

2520
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:25,980
Please, I just made it.

2521
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:26,220
Please!

2522
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:27,320
No, please!

2523
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,540
Hold on, I'm pulling up my picture.

2524
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:33,020
Resume, resume, resume.

2525
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:33,880
Okay.

2526
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:35,000
Use the interface.

2527
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:38,940
This one.

2528
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:39,740
Down!

2529
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:40,740
Saturn!

2530
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:42,560
Down!

2531
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:43,660
You!

2532
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:44,620
Down!

2533
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:45,900
Star, star, star, star!

2534
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:46,460
Star!

2535
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:47,340
Star!

2536
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:47,800
Star!

2537
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:53,340
What's going on?

2538
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:54,480
What's happening?

2539
02:12:54,660 --> 02:12:54,780
Oh!

2540
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:56,200
An elevator.

2541
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:57,420
Lift it.

2542
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:59,020
No, no, no, no, no!

2543
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:00,520
I just made it here!

2544
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:00,760
Please!

2545
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:02,720
Go down!

2546
02:13:02,820 --> 02:13:03,060
Go down!

2547
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:12,280
Ship log.

2548
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:13,080
Updated.

2549
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:15,700
Wait, what is this?

2550
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:17,620
What does this mean?

2551
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:24,790
Okay.

2552
02:13:25,810 --> 02:13:26,630
I still have a couple of seconds.

2553
02:13:28,330 --> 02:13:29,470
Oh, I'm getting hurt?

2554
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:30,330
Wait, what's happening?

2555
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:32,210
Oh, I'm just in the light.

2556
02:13:32,270 --> 02:13:32,730
That's what it is.

2557
02:13:35,950 --> 02:13:36,390
Huh?

2558
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,140
Huh?

2559
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:43,980
Updating.

2560
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:44,420
Updating.

2561
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:45,020
Updating.

2562
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:45,360
Updating.

2563
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:45,760
Updating.

2564
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,100
Updating.

2565
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:47,580
Huh?

2566
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:51,140
What does...

2567
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:51,440
Huh?

2568
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:53,460
Huh?

2569
02:13:53,900 --> 02:13:57,760
In past loops you looked at the ghost matter and instantly assumed you couldn't get past.

2570
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:58,880
In past loops you looked at the ghost matter and instantly assumed you couldn't get past.

2571
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,240
Yeah, that sounds about right.

2572
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:01,480
Oh!

2573
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:02,960
There's a thingy in here!

2574
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:06,380
I'll come back.

2575
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:07,860
Next round.

2576
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:09,300
I'll come back, everybody.

2577
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:15,800
Unless...

2578
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:19,080
No, we don't have time.

2579
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:22,660
There it is.

2580
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:25,740
Am I right at the top?

2581
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:26,520
It's kind of fun.

2582
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:30,600
Hmm.

2583
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:35,000
But now we can get there so easily.

2584
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:37,040
I'm wondering...

2585
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:38,800
I used...

2586
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:43,300
I can probably bring the artifact now that I know how to get around the ghost matter.

2587
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:43,960
So...

2588
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:55,280
Nice.

2589
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:57,780
Is he good?

2590
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,340
Yeah.

2591
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:01,340
I'll put some of my throat stuff in it.

2592
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,060
That's what they mean.

2593
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:08,760
Oh la la la la.

2594
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:12,960
Wow.

2595
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:14,480
Wow.

2596
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:15,800
Wow.

2597
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,360
Holy moly.

2598
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:32,700
Secret.

2599
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:36,340
A map I found in the abandoned temple reveals a secret location.

2600
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:38,340
Somewhere within the stranger.

2601
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:39,020
Oh!

2602
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:40,180
But you're not gonna show me?

2603
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:43,860
Okay, we're gonna have to go screenshot those points, I think.

2604
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:44,580
Oh wait, here we go.

2605
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:45,200
Thank goodness.

2606
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:48,500
Projection that seems to reveal a secret location within the stranger.

2607
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:52,180
Meet a secret stranger...

2608
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:52,860
Yep.

2609
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:57,340
Too much progress for the voice.

2610
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:02,620
Secret ope- Secret location?

2611
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:09,200
Symbol room, a secret room filled with wooden containers marked with different symbols.

2612
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:13,660
Three of the containers are marked with glowing vault seals, but their contents have been burned away.

2613
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:21,820
I opened the container marked with the symbol of a burning slide reel, Yup, and then we use that.

2614
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:27,800
They all say the same thing, I'm just trying to...

2615
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:48,240
There is?

2616
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,840
Oh, that's how we did the...

2617
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:53,480
Okay, yes.

2618
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:55,680
That's how we did the elevator.

2619
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:56,360
Duh.

2620
02:16:57,860 --> 02:17:01,840
Entering the correct sequence opens a path to a secret room beneath the temple.

2621
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:03,440
There was some stuff upstairs.

2622
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:05,220
I guess that's what we didn't get.

2623
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:09,160
And then we have all these secret locations to go to.

2624
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:12,100
So that's exciting.

2625
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:14,280
Yippee.

2626
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:16,060
Yippee yippee.

2627
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:17,880
Okay.

2628
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:25,300
I will not make this mistake again.

2629
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:30,780
And the slide reel.

2630
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:32,520
Yes, the slide reel.

2631
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:32,940
Thank you.

2632
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,480
Yes, we need that.

2633
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:37,800
That probably is what the... is saying is remaining, right?

2634
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:40,020
So we'll go look at the slide reel.

2635
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:40,840
We'll go...

2636
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,420
We'll go there first, for sure.

2637
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:50,180
And I think I'm... since we'll be there, I'm gonna...

2638
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:52,380
You can kind of see them in the...

2639
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:56,320
In the logs, but since we won't have...

2640
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:58,060
I won't memorize them.

2641
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:00,520
I won't memorize them.

2642
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:03,700
And since we won't have the ship...

2643
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,300
I'll just... I'm just gonna...

2644
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,980
I'm just gonna screenshot them.

2645
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:11,920
Hello.

2646
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,160
I would like to do a tumble.

2647
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:18,100
Okay.

2648
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:20,760
Awesome.

2649
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:24,040
I know that there's like an easier way to get there, but...

2650
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:29,760
I really didn't want to go through the little hole.

2651
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:32,200
It's kind of obnoxious, so...

2652
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:33,560
And I can't...

2653
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:35,900
Well, actually, I guess we could...

2654
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:37,080
Well, I'd have to open it.

2655
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:37,360
It's fine.

2656
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:37,940
It's fine.

2657
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,820
Everything's fine, you guys.

2658
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:40,660
It's all good.

2659
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:42,800
I like the river.

2660
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:43,420
Me too.

2661
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:45,480
I like the river also.

2662
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:47,200
Okay.

2663
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,160
Okay.

2664
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:53,480
I'm gonna grab the artifact just in case I need it.

2665
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:59,840
Because this is probably the easiest one to get, so...

2666
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:03,280
Well, I'm playing along with my own spooky game right now.

2667
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:05,800
And this DLC is spooky.

2668
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:09,200
We really hit a fun point in the game, though.

2669
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:09,960
I believe in us...

2670
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:11,220
Baby's got this.

2671
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:11,980
We got this!

2672
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:13,780
Thanks, Carl!

2673
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:13,860
Carl!

2674
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:17,280
Yeah,

2675
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:23,520
it's good to just grab it, I think.

2676
02:19:26,590 --> 02:19:27,780
And have it on hand.

2677
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:32,910
The bow is...

2678
02:19:34,690 --> 02:19:35,650
ISO code.

2679
02:19:37,810 --> 02:19:38,950
Baby's strong.

2680
02:19:40,050 --> 02:19:41,670
This is Baby Nation.

2681
02:19:42,150 --> 02:19:43,430
Babies, rise up.

2682
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:44,610
Babies?

2683
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:44,810
Babies?

2684
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:47,390
If you're a baby, say Goo Goo Gaga.

2685
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:48,970
All my babies in the chat!

2686
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:50,190
Goo Goo Gaga!

2687
02:19:51,390 --> 02:19:52,610
All my babies in the chat!

2688
02:19:56,610 --> 02:19:57,010
Yeah!

2689
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:02,490
Goo Goo Gaga!

2690
02:20:03,090 --> 02:20:05,730
Gosh, I really can just get you guys to say anything, can't I?

2691
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:10,450
Oh my god, look at all these eggs!

2692
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:21,010
Baby maxing.

2693
02:20:21,230 --> 02:20:21,550
No!

2694
02:20:22,510 --> 02:20:23,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2695
02:20:23,490 --> 02:20:24,190
This way, this way, this way.

2696
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:25,210
This way, this way.

2697
02:20:28,330 --> 02:20:28,970
Yes, streamer.

2698
02:20:31,230 --> 02:20:32,750
You take me for a fool.

2699
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:35,150
I take you for a baby.

2700
02:20:35,530 --> 02:20:36,230
Goo Goo Gaga.

2701
02:20:38,750 --> 02:20:39,850
I take you for a baby.

2702
02:20:45,330 --> 02:20:46,250
Goo Goo Gaga.

2703
02:20:46,470 --> 02:20:47,090
T.L.

2704
02:20:47,130 --> 02:20:47,850
God, bitches.

2705
02:20:48,550 --> 02:20:50,570
I don't think that's what a baby would say.

2706
02:20:50,890 --> 02:20:52,410
Don't be unrealistic.

2707
02:20:53,430 --> 02:20:55,510
Only realism in my streams, please.

2708
02:20:55,570 --> 02:20:55,930
Thank you.

2709
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:03,080
I don't want to set some weird standards for babies.

2710
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:04,520
Goo Goo Gaga.

2711
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,400
I want...

2712
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:06,520
I want milk.

2713
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:12,350
Um, please talk to your mom about that.

2714
02:21:14,850 --> 02:21:15,330
Woo.

2715
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:16,350
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

2716
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:17,010
Goo Goo Gaga.

2717
02:21:17,010 --> 02:21:18,190
This is the ghost.

2718
02:21:18,330 --> 02:21:20,790
Ghosts are real and I'm proof of it.

2719
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:21,810
Obviously.

2720
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:28,630
Do you sometimes think of your wisps as your babies?

2721
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:30,030
Never, even once.

2722
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:36,410
I've never, ever, once even thought that.

2723
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:37,370
But that's okay.

2724
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:43,950
I've never once thought, aw, my little precious babies.

2725
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:47,050
Only realism.

2726
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:48,030
Ah, a ghost.

2727
02:21:48,070 --> 02:21:49,170
Get the exorcist.

2728
02:21:49,390 --> 02:21:49,870
No!

2729
02:21:51,370 --> 02:21:52,710
I'm a good ghost.

2730
02:21:52,890 --> 02:21:53,650
Shits diaper.

2731
02:21:56,130 --> 02:21:57,710
This is the projection room, right?

2732
02:21:57,810 --> 02:22:02,750
So we'll have to come back here to see that.

2733
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:15,080
Oh, I was like what is down there?

2734
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:16,960
Literally where we just came from.

2735
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:18,920
So they stopped.

2736
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,160
They were like, abandoned the eye.

2737
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:22,960
We don't believe in the eye anymore.

2738
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:24,960
We believe in the burned reels.

2739
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:27,640
They were like, the eye sucks.

2740
02:22:27,740 --> 02:22:28,600
Screw the eye.

2741
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:30,740
It's burned reels time.

2742
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:31,740
That's where it's all...

2743
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:34,980
I thought I remembered.

2744
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:36,520
Anyway.

2745
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:41,700
We're fine.

2746
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:48,320
Yeah, burned reels is where it's at, everybody.

2747
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:53,860
I like the music here.

2748
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:54,540
It's very cool.

2749
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:56,420
Oh...

2750
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:16,620
Dog...

2751
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:17,040
Oh!

2752
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:18,660
Look at that!

2753
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:22,140
Oh, how handy!

2754
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:23,560
There's a shortcut!

2755
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:27,840
Glad I checked up here.

2756
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:34,500
OK.

2757
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:36,060
Use the interface.

2758
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,720
You, Saturn.

2759
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:41,160
You, you...

2760
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:46,270
What's happening again?

2761
02:24:04,220 --> 02:24:05,800
Oh, we're gonna need the real...

2762
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:07,240
Oopsie.

2763
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:08,400
It's fine, though.

2764
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:10,280
OK.

2765
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:12,620
Let's pick up the lanterns.

2766
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:26,300
This doesn't really help that much either, though.

2767
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:27,160
Does it?

2768
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:28,160
There was like...

2769
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:29,680
A better one.

2770
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:30,740
A better way to see...

2771
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:30,960
Hold on.

2772
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:31,920
Probably through the...

2773
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:33,700
Through here, we'll see it better, right?

2774
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:38,500
Let's... Hold on.

2775
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:40,380
You want to screenshot these?

2776
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:41,640
Give me one second.

2777
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:43,260
We're gonna have to come back for the...

2778
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:46,040
For the artifact, anyway.

2779
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:52,820
Hmm...

2780
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:55,280
Insert.

2781
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:58,840
And let's go get this guy right here.

2782
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:00,980
Signal scope can zoom.

2783
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:01,400
Oh!

2784
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,180
You're so right!

2785
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:04,460
Then we'll do that.

2786
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:10,280
Just give me one second.

2787
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:11,700
Let's see.

2788
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:12,300
Let's look at this first.

2789
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:13,420
Because it might give us a...

2790
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:15,100
Also zoomed in on here.

2791
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:15,820
And so...

2792
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:19,340
If it dies, we can just screenshot it from here.

2793
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,000
Oh!

2794
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:22,560
Worship.

2795
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:25,900
Oh.

2796
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:27,260
They sink it.

2797
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:29,540
Then they look at the camera.

2798
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:30,180
Look at that.

2799
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:31,500
One guy is really happy.

2800
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:32,800
Oh!

2801
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:35,440
Oh!

2802
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:35,800
Oh!

2803
02:25:36,620 --> 02:25:38,440
This is like not your best angle.

2804
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:38,960
But that's OK.

2805
02:25:40,460 --> 02:25:41,180
They're like...

2806
02:25:41,180 --> 02:25:41,420
Yeah!

2807
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:41,680
Yeah!

2808
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:42,640
Screw the eye!

2809
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:43,200
Screw the eye!

2810
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,140
We're gonna go burn all these!

2811
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:45,900
Erase history!

2812
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:46,700
Erase history!

2813
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:49,580
He's like...

2814
02:25:49,580 --> 02:25:49,660
Whoa!

2815
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:50,040
Whoa!

2816
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:50,420
Whoa!

2817
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:50,780
Whoa!

2818
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:51,040
Whoa!

2819
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:53,420
There's gotta be a method to our madness.

2820
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:55,860
This one?

2821
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:56,660
Wait.

2822
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:57,300
What the hell is this?

2823
02:25:58,640 --> 02:25:59,980
They're sinking the egg.

2824
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,680
It's saved.

2825
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:13,060
Oh!

2826
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:14,760
I think they...

2827
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:16,780
Save the information?

2828
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:16,980
Oh!

2829
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:17,180
They're saving the information, maybe?

2830
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,760
Unarchived karaoke deletes browser history.

2831
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:25,540
Real!

2832
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:27,120
Nah!

2833
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:32,610
OK.

2834
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:34,810
Interesting.

2835
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:37,970
So where the hell do we find that thing?

2836
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:39,470
Maybe...

2837
02:26:39,470 --> 02:26:41,930
That thingamabob...

2838
02:26:41,930 --> 02:26:43,450
Is in...

2839
02:26:43,450 --> 02:26:43,790
Well...

2840
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:44,470
OK.

2841
02:26:45,220 --> 02:26:46,450
Up here.

2842
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:48,390
I can't quite tell if...

2843
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:50,090
What these locations are about.

2844
02:26:50,690 --> 02:26:52,470
Are they of that thingamabob?

2845
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:55,010
Or are they of the places where they burn the...

2846
02:26:55,010 --> 02:26:55,930
The reels?

2847
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:00,530
Scant eclipse channel.

2848
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:02,390
OK.

2849
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:04,630
Signal scope, right?

2850
02:27:13,530 --> 02:27:14,010
I...

2851
02:27:14,010 --> 02:27:15,530
It zooms in way too much.

2852
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:17,190
Because now I'm like...

2853
02:27:17,190 --> 02:27:18,470
I don't even know what the heck...

2854
02:27:18,470 --> 02:27:19,210
Where the heck that is.

2855
02:27:19,810 --> 02:27:20,290
OK.

2856
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:20,550
Hold on.

2857
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:26,940
Is that an egg?

2858
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:28,480
OK, guys.

2859
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:29,840
I think I found the egg for real.

2860
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:32,480
Then back up.

2861
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:33,780
Shut up.

2862
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:35,340
Stop using logic against me.

2863
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:35,580
OK?

2864
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:38,400
Stop being sensible.

2865
02:27:38,660 --> 02:27:39,540
I don't like that.

2866
02:27:41,580 --> 02:27:43,300
I actually have no idea where this is.

2867
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:43,660
Wait.

2868
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:44,560
Is this like a secret?

2869
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:47,800
Secret!

2870
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:51,280
Oh my gosh!

2871
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:53,700
Print screen.

2872
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:54,520
Hold on.

2873
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:56,960
Print screen.

2874
02:27:58,740 --> 02:27:59,260
Paint.

2875
02:27:59,640 --> 02:28:00,160
Paste.

2876
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:07,540
OK.

2877
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:07,940
Next.

2878
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,520
This one is pretty easy.

2879
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,060
I'd say.

2880
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:23,780
I don't even...

2881
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:25,280
This one is right by...

2882
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:25,400
Yeah.

2883
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:26,520
This one is right at the beginning.

2884
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:28,120
So I'm just going to print screen.

2885
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:31,780
F12.

2886
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:33,380
Hi, you guys.

2887
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:33,780
I'm...

2888
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:34,160
I...

2889
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:35,560
I put everything into paint.

2890
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:36,760
I'm...

2891
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:38,760
I'm just going to keep creating.

2892
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:38,920
I know it.

2893
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:40,520
Probably drives people crazy.

2894
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:42,620
But you know what?

2895
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:43,860
At least I'm not Matara.

2896
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:44,920
Who gazo's everything.

2897
02:28:49,270 --> 02:28:51,970
This one is...

2898
02:28:58,880 --> 02:28:59,540
Zoom in.

2899
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:00,400
RB.

2900
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:01,760
RB.

2901
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:02,440
RB?

2902
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:04,320
Wait, why isn't it?

2903
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:05,380
It's equipped?

2904
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:07,680
Why isn't it zooming in?

2905
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:12,650
Equipped?

2906
02:29:12,770 --> 02:29:13,250
RB.

2907
02:29:13,370 --> 02:29:14,650
It's not zooming in for some reason.

2908
02:29:15,230 --> 02:29:15,710
OK.

2909
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:16,990
Why?

2910
02:29:16,990 --> 02:29:22,250
Uh, I'm trying to see which this is.

2911
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:24,430
I can't tell.

2912
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:34,350
Print screen, Ctrl-R, MS Paint, Enter, Ctrl-V, Master Race.

2913
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:36,930
Oh no, it's a bug!

2914
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:38,090
Uh-oh.

2915
02:29:38,210 --> 02:29:38,990
Okay, hold on.

2916
02:29:40,830 --> 02:29:42,950
But this is where we're at, actually.

2917
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:44,070
Now that I think about it, right?

2918
02:29:44,610 --> 02:29:45,650
This is where we're at.

2919
02:29:46,030 --> 02:29:47,290
So there's a hidden room.

2920
02:29:48,770 --> 02:29:49,850
I'm guessing, right?

2921
02:29:50,930 --> 02:29:52,350
This is where we're at, I think.

2922
02:29:52,450 --> 02:29:53,450
It's a known bug.

2923
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:54,910
You guys know everything!

2924
02:29:55,570 --> 02:29:56,970
How do you guys know so much?

2925
02:29:59,670 --> 02:30:01,230
How do you guys know everything?

2926
02:30:04,990 --> 02:30:05,950
Jeffrey told us.

2927
02:30:06,090 --> 02:30:06,270
Oh.

2928
02:30:06,990 --> 02:30:08,290
You guys know everything.

2929
02:30:21,310 --> 02:30:21,890
Hold on.

2930
02:30:22,990 --> 02:30:23,870
Um, wait.

2931
02:30:24,590 --> 02:30:25,210
Hold on.

2932
02:30:26,590 --> 02:30:27,170
Uh-oh.

2933
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:31,090
I'm really slow and I can't put down the artifact.

2934
02:30:31,150 --> 02:30:32,190
Uh-oh.

2935
02:30:33,790 --> 02:30:34,510
Uh-oh.

2936
02:30:34,710 --> 02:30:35,830
Wait, I'm really slow?

2937
02:30:36,910 --> 02:30:39,110
And I can't put down the artifact?

2938
02:30:40,530 --> 02:30:41,330
No, no!

2939
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:50,960
But I can still rotate this.

2940
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:52,360
I'm just gonna be a little slow, guys.

2941
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:53,880
Press RB.

2942
02:30:57,660 --> 02:30:58,700
RB doesn't work!

2943
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:00,200
RB doesn't work!

2944
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:00,960
Uh-oh.

2945
02:31:03,140 --> 02:31:03,820
RB's stuck.

2946
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:08,750
RB's stuck!

2947
02:31:12,410 --> 02:31:13,890
Oh my god, I'm really...

2948
02:31:13,890 --> 02:31:15,010
I'm really slow.

2949
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:21,340
I always press...

2950
02:31:21,340 --> 02:31:24,780
I always press like where circle is because I'm so used to playing...

2951
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:26,540
dang metal gear.

2952
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:27,180
Okay, hold on.

2953
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:28,020
Um...

2954
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:32,020
Ah...

2955
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:32,920
RB.

2956
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:32,980
Where are we?

2957
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:38,200
How do I...

2958
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:45,230
Hold on.

2959
02:31:47,370 --> 02:31:48,490
I did it again.

2960
02:31:55,490 --> 02:31:56,950
What can I set it to?

2961
02:31:58,590 --> 02:31:59,730
How can I set it?

2962
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:04,850
Maybe that worked?

2963
02:32:06,350 --> 02:32:07,030
We're fixed!

2964
02:32:07,150 --> 02:32:07,490
We're fixed!

2965
02:32:07,510 --> 02:32:07,890
We're fixed!

2966
02:32:09,410 --> 02:32:11,430
I just reset everything.

2967
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:14,230
Which I didn't change anything before either, so we're good.

2968
02:32:14,950 --> 02:32:15,830
Okey-dokey.

2969
02:32:15,970 --> 02:32:16,830
Let's get out of here.

2970
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:20,350
Oh, there's one in here!

2971
02:32:21,410 --> 02:32:22,990
There's been one in here this whole time.

2972
02:32:25,810 --> 02:32:26,690
Okay, so...

2973
02:32:27,990 --> 02:32:31,790
If I'm looking at this picture, it's in this tower here.

2974
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:35,230
But...

2975
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:38,370
Right there.

2976
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:38,730
Right there.

2977
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,090
Right there.

2978
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:46,300
Hmm.

2979
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:48,000
Oh my god!

2980
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:50,320
Why?

2981
02:32:51,740 --> 02:32:53,580
Why do you have to frighten me so?

2982
02:32:56,060 --> 02:32:57,940
Oh, I thought it would stop halfway through.

2983
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:07,040
I thought it would stop halfway through and so I could...

2984
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:13,880
Nope.

2985
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:14,780
Nope.

2986
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:15,780
Nope.

2987
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:17,440
Hmm.

2988
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:19,540
Let's see.

2989
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:20,940
How can we get in here?

2990
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:25,140
I have to go back up.

2991
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:28,080
Oh, gosh.

2992
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:29,840
I don't know if

2993
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:39,120
the building was going to come down or not.

2994
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:42,200
Holy moly.

2995
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:43,440
Okay.

2996
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:44,840
Let's go downstairs.

2997
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:46,380
Okay.

2998
02:33:50,050 --> 02:33:51,110
So, right there.

2999
02:33:52,350 --> 02:33:54,070
And down a little bit more.

3000
02:34:01,510 --> 02:34:02,110
Ah.

3001
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:05,390
Oh.

3002
02:34:07,070 --> 02:34:07,670
Ah.

3003
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:10,050
Yolo.

3004
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:17,650
I think I went too far down.

3005
02:34:18,230 --> 02:34:20,890
Oh, we're exactly where we were before.

3006
02:34:21,210 --> 02:34:22,590
And with no elevator.

3007
02:34:26,610 --> 02:34:26,970
Oh.

3008
02:34:29,130 --> 02:34:29,490
Goodness.

3009
02:34:30,190 --> 02:34:30,470
Hmm.

3010
02:34:30,770 --> 02:34:31,130
Okay.

3011
02:34:31,190 --> 02:34:31,430
Hold on.

3012
02:34:32,550 --> 02:34:32,910
Okay.

3013
02:34:32,950 --> 02:34:33,310
Hold on.

3014
02:34:33,650 --> 02:34:34,010
Let's...

3015
02:34:34,490 --> 02:34:34,850
Let's...

3016
02:34:34,850 --> 02:34:35,070
Oh.

3017
02:34:35,330 --> 02:34:38,250
It's going to be such a pain in the butt getting over there again.

3018
02:34:39,610 --> 02:34:39,970
Ouch.

3019
02:34:40,110 --> 02:34:40,770
We're all good.

3020
02:34:41,410 --> 02:34:41,950
Everything's fine.

3021
02:34:45,990 --> 02:34:47,150
We're going to figure this out.

3022
02:34:47,230 --> 02:34:48,290
We're going to figure this out, guys.

3023
02:34:49,790 --> 02:34:50,330
Let's see.

3024
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:51,990
I'm looking at it.

3025
02:34:52,210 --> 02:34:52,570
Okay.

3026
02:34:52,590 --> 02:34:53,330
You know what?

3027
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:53,870
It's so funny.

3028
02:34:53,910 --> 02:34:54,470
I never know...

3029
02:34:54,470 --> 02:34:54,730
I'm...

3030
02:34:54,730 --> 02:34:58,630
I guess I never noticed that part before.

3031
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:00,810
Hmm.

3032
02:35:03,690 --> 02:35:05,370
Could have brought the elevator back down.

3033
02:35:05,490 --> 02:35:05,890
No, no.

3034
02:35:05,930 --> 02:35:07,510
I could not because it was broken.

3035
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:15,860
No, no, no.

3036
02:35:16,340 --> 02:35:16,780
No.

3037
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:23,020
What if I like launch my...

3038
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:23,860
I see.

3039
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:29,040
Oh.

3040
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:30,080
Oh.

3041
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:31,620
Oh.

3042
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:33,600
I can't...

3043
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:33,680
I can't...

3044
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:35,040
I can't equip my launch scouter.

3045
02:35:36,180 --> 02:35:38,300
I can't equip my scouter.

3046
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:40,800
My RB is still broken.

3047
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:42,260
I'm going to have to restart the game maybe.

3048
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:43,400
Okay.

3049
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:49,400
Oh, no.

3050
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:50,700
I just wanted to...

3051
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:51,380
I wanted to...

3052
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:53,700
Rebind it.

3053
02:36:01,650 --> 02:36:02,250
Equipment.

3054
02:36:02,390 --> 02:36:02,990
Retrieve.

3055
02:36:03,010 --> 02:36:03,350
Scout.

3056
02:36:06,470 --> 02:36:07,070
Scout.

3057
02:36:07,410 --> 02:36:08,010
Scout.

3058
02:36:14,130 --> 02:36:15,310
There's only retrieve.

3059
02:36:17,810 --> 02:36:18,510
Okay.

3060
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:20,210
Primary action.

3061
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:22,930
No.

3062
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:25,490
It's not primary interact.

3063
02:36:28,630 --> 02:36:29,330
Hmm.

3064
02:36:30,050 --> 02:36:31,450
Primary action tool.

3065
02:36:33,050 --> 02:36:33,750
Oh?

3066
02:36:35,210 --> 02:36:36,430
Use the mouse.

3067
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:37,810
It's such a pain in the butt though.

3068
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:42,470
Huh.

3069
02:36:43,470 --> 02:36:44,710
Primary tool interaction.

3070
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:45,250
Wait.

3071
02:36:45,290 --> 02:36:46,070
Where do you guys see that?

3072
02:36:47,150 --> 02:36:47,550
Oh.

3073
02:36:47,590 --> 02:36:47,750
Here.

3074
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:48,090
Here.

3075
02:36:48,090 --> 02:36:48,190
Here.

3076
02:36:48,230 --> 02:36:48,350
Oh.

3077
02:36:48,410 --> 02:36:48,670
Thank you.

3078
02:36:49,150 --> 02:36:49,550
Okay.

3079
02:36:49,950 --> 02:36:50,350
Oh.

3080
02:36:50,810 --> 02:36:52,410
How do I rebind that?

3081
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:55,730
If I...

3082
02:36:55,730 --> 02:36:57,730
If I press it, it like...

3083
02:36:58,290 --> 02:36:58,690
Okay.

3084
02:36:58,730 --> 02:36:58,950
Here we go.

3085
02:37:00,370 --> 02:37:01,010
There we go.

3086
02:37:01,110 --> 02:37:01,390
Okay.

3087
02:37:01,470 --> 02:37:01,690
Okay.

3088
02:37:03,670 --> 02:37:04,070
Okay.

3089
02:37:04,070 --> 02:37:04,430
Okay.

3090
02:37:06,290 --> 02:37:06,690
Okay.

3091
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:11,920
I just really should stop.

3092
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:12,220
Uh -huh.

3093
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:14,300
Aha-ha-ha.

3094
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:16,640
See?

3095
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:18,560
The dang elevator could stop here.

3096
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:19,660
It just chooses not to.

3097
02:37:23,850 --> 02:37:24,450
Hmm.

3098
02:37:27,050 --> 02:37:28,210
Now if I...

3099
02:37:28,210 --> 02:37:28,990
Shoot it...

3100
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:37,860
Like here.

3101
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:43,760
It got the most ideal way to see it.

3102
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:46,840
Wait.

3103
02:37:46,940 --> 02:37:47,740
Where is it?

3104
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:56,640
Okay, there's... I don't see any way to go in from the bottom.

3105
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:02,140
I was seeing if I could fly up from the bottom or something.

3106
02:38:05,020 --> 02:38:06,760
Do I just have to be good at flying?

3107
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:10,620
Do I just have to be good?

3108
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:13,840
Do I just have to be really smooth with this?

3109
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:15,660
Oh!

3110
02:38:15,820 --> 02:38:16,840
Oh, I can't get in there!

3111
02:38:16,980 --> 02:38:24,220
Let me see from down... Oh no, I should have at least brought the elevator down.

3112
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:24,880
Okay.

3113
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:28,380
Well, I guess that makes things a bit easier.

3114
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,440
Tell the elevators who's boss.

3115
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:35,540
Yeah, see if I want to bring the elevator back down, the thing is broken.

3116
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:38,740
And it always has been, so...

3117
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:41,940
All the way back.

3118
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:43,940
Here we go again.

3119
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:55,620
Peek-a-boo!

3120
02:38:55,660 --> 02:38:56,140
Peek-a-boo!

3121
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:59,820
It looks like... It looks like...

3122
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:00,580
Oh yeah.

3123
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:02,760
Is that a tree?

3124
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:04,420
Yeah.

3125
02:39:05,340 --> 02:39:10,580
It looks like this one is like more broken than this one, but I don't think it is.

3126
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:14,420
I think it's the same... Yeah, it's the same amount.

3127
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:15,780
I don't know if I can fit in there.

3128
02:39:26,530 --> 02:39:29,050
Bring... skillshot the scout to the elevator and bring it down?

3129
02:39:29,350 --> 02:39:31,050
Holy cow, that would be insane.

3130
02:39:31,090 --> 02:39:31,570
Insane, right?

3131
02:39:32,750 --> 02:39:34,150
Gotta be clever, Mint?

3132
02:39:34,970 --> 02:39:36,090
I'm... I'm clever!

3133
02:39:37,970 --> 02:39:39,030
I'm kashikoi.

3134
02:39:39,210 --> 02:39:40,230
I'm, you know...

3135
02:39:42,310 --> 02:39:43,230
Hold on!

3136
02:39:46,710 --> 02:39:48,070
Yeah, we can't fit through there.

3137
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:51,110
What's another way to be clever?

3138
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:54,270
Does it involve the elevator?

3139
02:39:54,530 --> 02:39:55,950
Because, I mean, I could... Pew!

3140
02:39:56,130 --> 02:39:58,190
I could skillshot it, right?

3141
02:39:59,230 --> 02:39:59,770
Like...

3142
02:40:01,810 --> 02:40:02,430
No?

3143
02:40:05,810 --> 02:40:06,430
No?

3144
02:40:06,430 --> 02:40:07,850
Too high, too high.

3145
02:40:10,710 --> 02:40:11,950
Dang it.

3146
02:40:18,250 --> 02:40:18,870
No.

3147
02:40:24,170 --> 02:40:26,170
He... He... Here!

3148
02:40:26,890 --> 02:40:27,790
Just kidding.

3149
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:29,150
Oh my gosh.

3150
02:40:29,150 --> 02:40:31,830
It's like the most precise thing that I'm ever doing ever.

3151
02:40:44,990 --> 02:40:46,030
I'm really thinking.

3152
02:40:46,670 --> 02:40:48,230
I'm really processing.

3153
02:40:49,130 --> 02:40:51,570
That's why I tried with the elevator before.

3154
02:41:03,010 --> 02:41:03,550
Hmm.

3155
02:41:05,830 --> 02:41:07,630
But maybe I just didn't do it correctly.

3156
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:24,600
So...

3157
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:26,960
I'm seeing smileys.

3158
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:27,720
Is someone...

3159
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:29,160
spoiling?

3160
02:41:30,460 --> 02:41:31,880
No spoiling, you guys.

3161
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:35,300
Oh, no, no.

3162
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:36,120
Get on here.

3163
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:38,360
Oh.

3164
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:39,140
Time's up, everybody.

3165
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:42,060
Time's up.

3166
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:53,880
Well, it's okay because we have the other ones as well.

3167
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:57,680
I only went to this one first because...

3168
02:41:58,640 --> 02:41:59,340
we were here.

3169
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:02,220
Hmm.

3170
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:05,180
Hmm.

3171
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:06,440
Think in the box.

3172
02:42:23,870 --> 02:42:26,050
Bro didn't even let us listen to the banger?

3173
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:27,790
Why the soundtrack?

3174
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:31,490
Oh, we're on a mission.

3175
02:42:32,650 --> 02:42:35,870
Oh, it wasn't spoils but backseats that could feel spoilery.

3176
02:42:36,070 --> 02:42:36,930
Oh, that's...

3177
02:42:36,930 --> 02:42:38,150
Oh, thanks guys.

3178
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:38,870
I appreciate it.

3179
02:42:38,870 --> 02:42:42,310
No backseating until I'm really like...

3180
02:42:42,310 --> 02:42:43,110
Help me!

3181
02:42:43,890 --> 02:42:46,130
And then only give a little hints.

3182
02:42:47,170 --> 02:42:48,730
Little tiny hints.

3183
02:42:50,330 --> 02:42:52,950
I don't think it's...

3184
02:42:54,890 --> 02:42:55,450
Yeah.

3185
02:42:55,610 --> 02:42:58,510
I was gonna say, I don't think we got anything else, truly.

3186
02:42:59,250 --> 02:42:59,970
Well, no.

3187
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:01,310
I mean, we saw...

3188
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:03,870
I guess it's this.

3189
02:43:03,970 --> 02:43:04,870
These are the...

3190
02:43:05,870 --> 02:43:08,610
Oh, this area I wanna go to so...

3191
02:43:08,610 --> 02:43:09,250
badly.

3192
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:12,410
This secret area.

3193
02:43:12,730 --> 02:43:14,590
I wanna go so badly.

3194
02:43:17,650 --> 02:43:18,470
Come here.

3195
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:24,510
New secret.

3196
02:43:24,750 --> 02:43:25,330
New secret.

3197
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:34,640
We gotta be so vague it doesn't even make sense.

3198
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:38,360
Here we go.

3199
02:43:38,360 --> 02:43:38,740
Meow.

3200
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:44,070
Meow.

3201
02:43:44,750 --> 02:43:45,430
Meow.

3202
02:43:45,870 --> 02:43:46,310
Okay.

3203
02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:48,870
We are inside the stranger.

3204
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:50,250
Which...

3205
02:43:50,250 --> 02:43:52,410
Take me out to dinner first.

3206
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:53,730
Oh my goodness.

3207
02:43:54,550 --> 02:43:56,590
That's what the stranger is saying right now.

3208
02:43:56,810 --> 02:43:57,810
He's like...

3209
02:43:57,810 --> 02:43:59,930
Yeah, I barely even know you.

3210
02:44:00,210 --> 02:44:00,830
Okay.

3211
02:44:01,470 --> 02:44:02,150
Roll.

3212
02:44:02,690 --> 02:44:03,150
There we go.

3213
02:44:07,410 --> 02:44:07,750
Perfect.

3214
02:44:09,290 --> 02:44:11,030
It's a beautiful sunny day.

3215
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:14,410
I'm stuck on...

3216
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:36,960
I'm gonna grab the artifact.

3217
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:41,180
I'm gonna grab the artifact first, though.

3218
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:42,740
Again, just in case.

3219
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,300
Just in case.

3220
02:44:46,420 --> 02:44:47,320
Just in case.

3221
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:48,520
Where are you going?

3222
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:50,420
To where the tower is?

3223
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:56,360
To where the tower is?

3224
02:44:56,380 --> 02:44:56,560
To where the tower is?

3225
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:56,900
Stranger.

3226
02:44:57,040 --> 02:44:58,280
I already know her!

3227
02:44:59,000 --> 02:44:59,540
Oh...

3228
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:30,580
I completely...

3229
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:33,440
Caught me...

3230
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:35,360
Off guard!

3231
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:37,840
Which is why...

3232
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:39,120
I can see that.

3233
02:45:39,820 --> 02:45:40,580
There...

3234
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:43,000
Nothing.

3235
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,000
This is why it's so funny!

3236
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:48,380
You're laughing too hard at this one.

3237
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:55,400
You're not laughing hard enough.

3238
02:45:58,780 --> 02:45:59,620
Oh man!

3239
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:01,960
That was a good one.

3240
02:46:04,820 --> 02:46:06,460
I think it's because... oh god.

3241
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:10,600
I think it's because I've only ever heard people do it correctly.

3242
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:15,000
And so when it's like...

3243
02:46:18,450 --> 02:46:19,190
You know.

3244
02:46:24,860 --> 02:46:26,120
Okay, okay, okay.

3245
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:27,980
Over there, over there, over there.

3246
02:46:33,370 --> 02:46:34,430
Is this it?

3247
02:46:34,690 --> 02:46:35,550
Wait, yeah.

3248
02:46:35,670 --> 02:46:36,030
Is it?

3249
02:46:36,090 --> 02:46:36,490
This is it.

3250
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:43,240
Okay.

3251
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:45,440
This way.

3252
02:46:49,310 --> 02:46:50,830
You're giving me tears in my eyes.

3253
02:46:55,990 --> 02:46:56,510
Hello?

3254
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:00,480
Hello?

3255
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:00,740
Over here?

3256
02:47:06,610 --> 02:47:07,710
This is it, right?

3257
02:47:08,170 --> 02:47:09,130
That looks like...

3258
02:47:09,130 --> 02:47:09,750
That's the egg!

3259
02:47:09,890 --> 02:47:10,410
That's the egg!

3260
02:47:10,450 --> 02:47:10,930
That's the egg.

3261
02:47:18,890 --> 02:47:20,110
Hopefully I didn't...

3262
02:47:20,110 --> 02:47:21,270
Need to...

3263
02:47:22,870 --> 02:47:23,910
Uh oh.

3264
02:47:24,170 --> 02:47:24,690
Wait.

3265
02:47:26,010 --> 02:47:26,670
Let's see.

3266
02:47:29,550 --> 02:47:30,070
Okay.

3267
02:47:30,370 --> 02:47:30,890
Huh?

3268
02:47:33,010 --> 02:47:33,830
Nice.

3269
02:47:36,610 --> 02:47:38,090
And it's...

3270
02:47:38,090 --> 02:47:41,710
Hold on.

3271
02:47:41,870 --> 02:47:43,750
I'm checking my screenshot.

3272
02:47:45,070 --> 02:47:46,590
It's in the trees.

3273
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:47,910
So it's...

3274
02:47:47,910 --> 02:47:50,070
It's basically where I'm at, right?

3275
02:47:52,410 --> 02:47:53,230
Here?

3276
02:47:58,340 --> 02:47:59,360
In here?

3277
02:47:59,580 --> 02:47:59,880
Hello?

3278
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:01,620
Hello?

3279
02:48:01,620 --> 02:48:01,700
Hello?

3280
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:02,880
Hello?

3281
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:05,180
Hello?

3282
02:48:09,980 --> 02:48:12,080
Is it in the water?

3283
02:48:12,880 --> 02:48:13,200
No.

3284
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:17,970
Do I hop up here?

3285
02:48:25,490 --> 02:48:27,570
Hold on, let me...

3286
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:29,070
Oh gosh, you guys!

3287
02:48:29,130 --> 02:48:30,350
My RB is broken again!

3288
02:48:30,970 --> 02:48:31,790
No way!

3289
02:48:32,090 --> 02:48:32,750
I just realized.

3290
02:48:32,910 --> 02:48:34,170
My RB is broken again.

3291
02:48:34,170 --> 02:48:35,270
Uh oh.

3292
02:48:35,430 --> 02:48:37,290
I might actually have to restart my game.

3293
02:48:43,660 --> 02:48:44,200
No!

3294
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:49,040
Unplug, replug the controller.

3295
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:51,420
It's a... It's a wireless controller.

3296
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:00,760
Jeff said to toggle active controller on off again.

3297
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:01,060
Okay.

3298
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:08,400
Oh.

3299
02:49:08,660 --> 02:49:10,120
I was like, wait a second.

3300
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:11,220
I can't move it!

3301
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:14,000
Okay, there we go!

3302
02:49:15,380 --> 02:49:15,840
Thank you!

3303
02:49:17,580 --> 02:49:18,560
Thank you, thank you!

3304
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:27,300
I hope you guys don't think that, like, you know...

3305
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:27,960
If I get a...

3306
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:30,900
A bug, I'm like, oh my god!

3307
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:31,340
How dare!

3308
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:33,160
I don't really care.

3309
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:34,940
Like, it doesn't bother me.

3310
02:49:35,060 --> 02:49:35,160
No!

3311
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:35,860
I fell!

3312
02:49:36,820 --> 02:49:38,420
Is there another way in?

3313
02:49:39,560 --> 02:49:40,120
Let's see.

3314
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:41,060
Is my boat still here?

3315
02:49:42,460 --> 02:49:42,880
Uh...

3316
02:49:42,880 --> 02:49:43,500
Nope.

3317
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:44,000
Nope.

3318
02:49:44,060 --> 02:49:44,820
She's long gone.

3319
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:01,120
Wait.

3320
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:04,000
It's pretty obvious, don't worry.

3321
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:06,020
Oh, so you're saying I'm stupid, huh?

3322
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:09,680
You're saying I'm a dummy, huh?

3323
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:10,460
Is that what you're saying?

3324
02:50:11,060 --> 02:50:13,100
You're saying, wow, Minto's so stupid.

3325
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:14,620
No, I'm just... Yeah.

3326
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:15,680
That's what you're saying, right?

3327
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:22,780
That scared me so much!

3328
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:25,120
Oh god, it happened right as I jumped in!

3329
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:27,400
Oh!

3330
02:50:30,750 --> 02:50:32,130
I think I found it.

3331
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:34,950
Oh!

3332
02:50:38,110 --> 02:50:39,810
I think I found it.

3333
02:50:45,850 --> 02:50:48,130
So why are all of these ones destroyed?

3334
02:50:48,530 --> 02:50:49,590
The thing...

3335
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:50,790
The thingy...

3336
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:55,580
Oh.

3337
02:50:57,460 --> 02:50:58,380
What a lovely portrait.

3338
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:03,320
I had a feeling it would move.

3339
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:05,380
Oh!

3340
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:07,460
Whoa!

3341
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:23,000
It looks like eyes are staring at me.

3342
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:23,580
It's so freaky.

3343
02:51:26,080 --> 02:51:26,640
Hello?

3344
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:28,460
Who locked me in?

3345
02:51:34,980 --> 02:51:35,900
I'm a

3346
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:42,900
good Minto, I promise!

3347
02:51:43,180 --> 02:51:43,800
Oh god!

3348
02:51:45,440 --> 02:51:46,140
Wait a second.

3349
02:51:46,200 --> 02:51:46,760
What's over here?

3350
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:50,200
Uh...

3351
02:51:57,410 --> 02:51:57,850
Anyway...

3352
02:51:59,190 --> 02:52:00,070
Rude as hell.

3353
02:52:02,490 --> 02:52:03,810
I'm taking this back.

3354
02:52:04,210 --> 02:52:05,070
And I'm...

3355
02:52:05,690 --> 02:52:07,730
I didn't know that I was going to fall through.

3356
02:52:08,330 --> 02:52:08,770
Okay?

3357
02:52:08,950 --> 02:52:09,890
Left the real.

3358
02:52:10,030 --> 02:52:11,370
I didn't know that I was going to be...

3359
02:52:11,970 --> 02:52:12,830
You know...

3360
02:52:13,370 --> 02:52:14,870
I guess we don't need the artifact.

3361
02:52:15,090 --> 02:52:15,850
For now.

3362
02:52:19,740 --> 02:52:20,780
This leads to...

3363
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:25,800
This room.

3364
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:29,080
Okay.

3365
02:52:31,060 --> 02:52:32,100
I have...

3366
02:52:33,220 --> 02:52:34,780
Something I wish to view.

3367
02:52:34,940 --> 02:52:35,360
Something I wish to view.

3368
02:52:35,700 --> 02:52:37,500
What if this is how we had to watch anime?

3369
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:39,980
What if this is how we had to watch anime?

3370
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:40,920
Um...

3371
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:43,880
Now I need to find a place for...

3372
02:52:43,880 --> 02:52:44,800
The lantern?

3373
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:47,840
Which is...

3374
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:48,260
Uh...

3375
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:51,080
Uh...

3376
02:52:51,080 --> 02:52:52,000
Oh, the tower.

3377
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:56,480
The tower had a ton of...

3378
02:52:56,480 --> 02:52:57,020
A ton of...

3379
02:52:59,400 --> 02:53:00,220
Nineteen eight...

3380
02:53:00,220 --> 02:53:01,620
Eighteen nineties anime.

3381
02:53:01,960 --> 02:53:02,660
Yeah, exactly.

3382
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:04,220
We're old school.

3383
02:53:04,300 --> 02:53:05,040
We're retro here.

3384
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:09,560
That's how you have to watch VTubers.

3385
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:11,300
I'm going to have all my...

3386
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:13,680
Streams in stop motion.

3387
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:14,580
From now on.

3388
02:53:16,040 --> 02:53:16,580
Let's

3389
02:53:21,410 --> 02:53:22,150
go onward.

3390
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:24,050
Where did we come from?

3391
02:53:24,330 --> 02:53:25,930
That one right there?

3392
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:28,270
Right?

3393
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:30,350
Yeah.

3394
02:53:33,610 --> 02:53:34,210
Claymation.

3395
02:53:43,400 --> 02:53:44,600
Every stream...

3396
02:53:44,600 --> 02:53:46,840
In five frames per second?

3397
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:49,960
Good luck everybody.

3398
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:51,420
Figuring out what's going on.

3399
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:57,680
Oh...

3400
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:58,200
Oh...

3401
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:00,160
Okay...

3402
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:01,780
We got a little more...

3403
02:54:01,780 --> 02:54:04,080
They're doing something with the seal?

3404
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:09,220
This is...

3405
02:54:09,220 --> 02:54:12,500
This is where the eye temple was!

3406
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:14,060
That's the binoculars!

3407
02:54:17,880 --> 02:54:19,560
Wait, what the hell are they holding?

3408
02:54:23,150 --> 02:54:23,790
Okay...

3409
02:54:23,790 --> 02:54:24,690
We've been here.

3410
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:25,290
We've been here.

3411
02:54:26,870 --> 02:54:27,530
Oh!

3412
02:54:28,770 --> 02:54:30,270
Hello my friend.

3413
02:54:30,510 --> 02:54:31,170
Oh.

3414
02:54:31,290 --> 02:54:33,030
He gives him the tablet.

3415
02:54:36,830 --> 02:54:37,490
Bye!

3416
02:54:38,710 --> 02:54:39,930
We go back.

3417
02:54:44,450 --> 02:54:45,950
There's a secret!

3418
02:54:46,990 --> 02:54:47,770
Crabby crab!

3419
02:54:50,370 --> 02:54:52,310
And then he goes down.

3420
02:54:52,470 --> 02:54:54,070
Oh my gosh, this is giving us so much information.

3421
02:54:54,070 --> 02:54:56,170
Oh my god!

3422
02:54:58,910 --> 02:54:59,430
Okay!

3423
02:54:59,810 --> 02:55:00,330
Okay!

3424
02:55:00,530 --> 02:55:00,890
Okay!

3425
02:55:01,050 --> 02:55:01,890
Wait a second.

3426
02:55:02,550 --> 02:55:04,870
So once he goes down, the lights come back on.

3427
02:55:05,150 --> 02:55:07,050
So that's what turns off the lights!

3428
02:55:10,010 --> 02:55:15,190
When you think about it, clips are just the Vtuber equivalent of watching an episode of Ranma half...

3429
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:17,430
Ranma half in...

3430
02:55:18,550 --> 02:55:20,510
In 10 minutes chunks on YouTube.

3431
02:55:20,510 --> 02:55:20,870
I do...

3432
02:55:31,440 --> 02:55:32,700
What is he doing here?

3433
02:55:32,740 --> 02:55:33,320
He's just chilling.

3434
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:38,140
Okay...

3435
02:55:38,820 --> 02:55:41,720
But I still haven't figured out a way down to the hole.

3436
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:42,940
Which is the issue, I think.

3437
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:44,800
Oh no.

3438
02:55:45,320 --> 02:55:49,120
I think as soon as I do that, two of the guys are going to start walking around more.

3439
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:49,940
Aren't they?

3440
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:55,880
Oh, right now they're upstairs, but as soon as I do that, they're probably all going to come running.

3441
02:55:58,860 --> 02:55:59,400
Okay.

3442
02:55:59,400 --> 02:56:01,480
Oh, shucks.

3443
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:04,380
Unless they start descending themselves.

3444
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:06,840
And then I follow them like before.

3445
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:13,080
We do need a cardboard box.

3446
02:56:13,740 --> 02:56:15,160
Okay, so that was one.

3447
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:17,520
Or rather...

3448
02:56:18,100 --> 02:56:18,640
two.

3449
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:19,560
Part two.

3450
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:28,180
The dam still hasn't broken, but like literally any second now it's probably going to...

3451
02:56:28,180 --> 02:56:28,840
Look at that thing.

3452
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:30,220
That thing is about to blow!

3453
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:33,460
Holy hell, we're watching Interstellar.

3454
02:56:34,460 --> 02:56:36,080
So the other one was at...

3455
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:37,860
Sorry, I'm checking my map.

3456
02:56:40,540 --> 02:56:42,360
So we have the one inside that...

3457
02:56:43,080 --> 02:56:44,340
building I'm trying to get to.

3458
02:56:47,720 --> 02:56:49,300
Oh, and the one at the very beginning.

3459
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:51,960
Which is like right around...

3460
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:52,200
here.

3461
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:54,580
Which I don't think we're going to make it.

3462
02:56:55,340 --> 02:56:56,520
It's going to become flooded.

3463
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:58,260
In like two seconds.

3464
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:01,880
Do you remember why you couldn't go down the hole?

3465
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:05,780
Because I died.

3466
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:10,220
Because I dropped down...

3467
02:57:10,220 --> 02:57:11,800
I couldn't find an entrance, rather.

3468
02:57:13,300 --> 02:57:15,060
I haven't been able to find an entrance yet.

3469
02:57:15,900 --> 02:57:17,860
I dropped down and I broke my legs.

3470
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:18,160
Okay.

3471
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:26,060
I don't think we're going to make it.

3472
02:57:26,520 --> 02:57:26,880
But...

3473
02:57:28,480 --> 02:57:29,820
I think it's going to become flooded.

3474
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:31,220
But...

3475
02:57:31,220 --> 02:57:31,940
We could try.

3476
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:34,200
But what killed you?

3477
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:35,200
Oh, it was the alarm.

3478
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:36,440
I do know that.

3479
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:40,520
Or rather, I don't know if the alarm is what killed me or if I died by my own...

3480
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:41,960
silliness.

3481
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:42,940
You know?

3482
02:57:49,630 --> 02:57:50,770
I could not tell you.

3483
02:58:01,250 --> 02:58:03,530
I don't have like an artifact or anything.

3484
02:58:03,710 --> 02:58:04,510
I have nothing with me.

3485
02:58:06,190 --> 02:58:08,970
I've got nothing on my property.

3486
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:15,180
Is stream a little stuttery?

3487
02:58:15,360 --> 02:58:19,200
Honestly, for me, streams have been so awful on YouTube.

3488
02:58:22,520 --> 02:58:24,080
I like the music here.

3489
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:28,940
This is so relaxing.

3490
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:34,360
Stream looks good today?

3491
02:58:34,480 --> 02:58:36,180
Streams are like in general...

3492
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:38,800
Like I'll be watching someone and like...

3493
02:58:38,800 --> 02:58:40,500
It's almost impossible to watch them.

3494
02:58:46,980 --> 02:58:48,560
But I'm glad that it's okay.

3495
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:52,540
I think it's probably because I'm using Firefox with like an ad blocker.

3496
02:58:53,500 --> 02:58:55,940
And they're like, um, can you stop that?

3497
02:58:59,440 --> 02:59:01,540
Oh my gosh, I didn't realize it would take me...

3498
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:02,000
Ah!

3499
02:59:03,180 --> 02:59:03,580
Ah!

3500
02:59:03,980 --> 02:59:04,120
Ah!

3501
02:59:04,120 --> 02:59:04,480
Ah!

3502
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:05,740
Ah!

3503
02:59:05,900 --> 02:59:05,920
Ah!

3504
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:11,980
Ah!

3505
02:59:11,980 --> 02:59:12,060
Ah!

3506
02:59:12,060 --> 02:59:12,320
Ah!

3507
02:59:12,320 --> 02:59:12,380
Ah!

3508
02:59:13,400 --> 02:59:13,800
Ah!

3509
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:14,100
Ah!

3510
02:59:14,100 --> 02:59:14,220
Ah!

3511
02:59:14,220 --> 02:59:14,300
Ah!

3512
02:59:24,210 --> 02:59:26,270
The house is like right here.

3513
02:59:26,550 --> 02:59:27,270
Oh god.

3514
02:59:33,130 --> 02:59:34,430
We made it.

3515
02:59:37,610 --> 02:59:40,330
Oh, the house was here.

3516
02:59:46,780 --> 02:59:48,600
Wait, have I never noticed that?

3517
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:49,440
What is that thing?

3518
02:59:50,600 --> 02:59:52,020
Oh I think it's...

3519
02:59:54,020 --> 02:59:54,280
Huh.

3520
02:59:55,140 --> 02:59:56,300
Is it just a bell?

3521
02:59:57,360 --> 02:59:58,560
Is it just like a decoration?

3522
02:59:58,640 --> 03:00:00,060
Yeah, maybe it's just a decoration.

3523
03:00:06,320 --> 03:00:07,120
Oh, really?

3524
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:11,600
Okay, good to know for the future.

3525
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,000
Oh, there it is!

3526
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:13,320
There it is!

3527
03:00:16,120 --> 03:00:17,700
The other house we need to get to.

3528
03:00:17,860 --> 03:00:19,740
Okay, I think we might...

3529
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:23,380
be able to still do it.

3530
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:24,220
We'll see.

3531
03:00:24,580 --> 03:00:25,220
Who knows?

3532
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:29,720
Maybe we had to wait this whole time to do it, to get in there, right?

3533
03:00:29,720 --> 03:00:31,140
It is this house, though.

3534
03:00:31,620 --> 03:00:32,300
I think.

3535
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:33,760
Right?

3536
03:00:47,340 --> 03:00:48,880
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

3537
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:51,020
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

3538
03:00:51,500 --> 03:00:52,640
Do-do-do-do.

3539
03:00:53,140 --> 03:00:54,320
Do-do-do-do-do.

3540
03:00:54,320 --> 03:00:54,780
Oh!

3541
03:00:58,140 --> 03:00:58,620
Oh!

3542
03:00:58,620 --> 03:01:01,300
It's this pla... wait.

3543
03:01:04,180 --> 03:01:06,500
Okay, so that first one was like super obvious.

3544
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:09,760
Can I rotate you, please?

3545
03:01:11,460 --> 03:01:12,480
Oh, it's stuck.

3546
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:14,060
Never mind.

3547
03:01:14,420 --> 03:01:15,760
That's the raft house.

3548
03:01:18,480 --> 03:01:19,400
There's our raft!

3549
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:22,100
Oh, dang.

3550
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:22,860
Okay, hold on.

3551
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:23,980
I'm looking at the picture again.

3552
03:01:29,420 --> 03:01:30,420
I'm zooming in.

3553
03:01:32,880 --> 03:01:35,600
I think we might just have to meditate to get to it.

3554
03:01:35,640 --> 03:01:36,400
Or to do it.

3555
03:01:36,580 --> 03:01:37,280
What is this?

3556
03:01:46,650 --> 03:01:48,410
I think we'll have to meditate.

3557
03:01:48,410 --> 03:01:50,770
Let's take it.

3558
03:01:57,810 --> 03:01:59,950
Wait, because it's like right...

3559
03:01:59,950 --> 03:02:00,830
Hold on.

3560
03:02:02,430 --> 03:02:03,230
I'm trying.

3561
03:02:03,850 --> 03:02:04,750
Down here.

3562
03:02:05,030 --> 03:02:05,710
Or something.

3563
03:02:06,350 --> 03:02:07,130
I think?

3564
03:02:08,350 --> 03:02:09,510
I'm getting pushed away.

3565
03:02:10,570 --> 03:02:11,130
Hmm.

3566
03:02:11,930 --> 03:02:16,060
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

3567
03:02:16,180 --> 03:02:18,120
Because there's like a bridge that I'm seeing.

3568
03:02:23,770 --> 03:02:25,750
Like, you see this place.

3569
03:02:26,090 --> 03:02:27,510
This is the place.

3570
03:02:27,610 --> 03:02:29,030
Yeah, you see this place.

3571
03:02:29,650 --> 03:02:30,530
And then...

3572
03:02:30,530 --> 03:02:32,070
You see...

3573
03:02:32,670 --> 03:02:33,770
There's a bridge.

3574
03:02:34,450 --> 03:02:34,950
Hmm...

3575
03:02:35,470 --> 03:02:36,550
Okay, I meditate.

3576
03:02:37,390 --> 03:02:38,270
I give up.

3577
03:02:40,470 --> 03:02:41,950
I'm not going to fight the current.

3578
03:02:43,990 --> 03:02:44,490
Okay.

3579
03:02:45,270 --> 03:02:47,470
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

3580
03:02:49,690 --> 03:02:50,510
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

3581
03:02:50,510 --> 03:02:51,310
I tried to do this while flooded.

3582
03:02:51,390 --> 03:02:51,990
Might be a bit hard.

3583
03:02:52,110 --> 03:02:52,290
Okay.

3584
03:02:52,690 --> 03:02:53,350
Good to know.

3585
03:02:53,430 --> 03:02:55,330
Good to know I probably made the right decision then.

3586
03:02:55,410 --> 03:02:56,390
And it's right at the entrance.

3587
03:02:56,570 --> 03:02:56,870
We'll be fine.

3588
03:03:13,710 --> 03:03:14,770
I love meditating.

3589
03:03:20,150 --> 03:03:20,790
And then...

3590
03:03:21,330 --> 03:03:22,530
We'll have this one.

3591
03:03:22,650 --> 03:03:24,010
And then also...

3592
03:03:25,730 --> 03:03:26,370
Did our...

3593
03:03:26,370 --> 03:03:27,450
Oh, our ship log did update.

3594
03:03:29,010 --> 03:03:29,490
Beep-beep.

3595
03:03:30,170 --> 03:03:30,590
Beep-beep.

3596
03:03:31,430 --> 03:03:31,750
Sec...

3597
03:03:31,750 --> 03:03:33,030
Oh, secret well.

3598
03:03:33,250 --> 03:03:33,590
Yes.

3599
03:03:33,750 --> 03:03:34,190
Well, it's...

3600
03:03:34,190 --> 03:03:34,990
It's like the...

3601
03:03:34,990 --> 03:03:36,430
Not really a secret.

3602
03:03:37,810 --> 03:03:43,490
The real I found in the slide burning room shows a container marked with a symbol glowing being handed to a shadowy figure.

3603
03:03:43,730 --> 03:03:47,910
The lights are extinguished and the figure carries the container down a dark well.

3604
03:03:50,950 --> 03:03:51,730
The room...

3605
03:03:51,730 --> 03:03:55,370
A room full of burned slide rails piled next to a strange device.

3606
03:03:56,810 --> 03:03:58,830
Am I able to use the device ever?

3607
03:03:58,970 --> 03:04:00,570
Or is it just not a thing?

3608
03:04:01,930 --> 03:04:04,190
I love meditating in bed with my eyes closed.

3609
03:04:04,370 --> 03:04:05,010
I call it sleeping.

3610
03:04:07,870 --> 03:04:08,390
Right.

3611
03:04:12,650 --> 03:04:13,910
I love sleeping too.

3612
03:04:15,250 --> 03:04:20,370
I found a hidden slide reel that shows a container marked with a glowing symbol being handed to a shadowy figure.

3613
03:04:20,490 --> 03:04:24,070
The lights are extinguished and the figure carries the container down into a dark well.

3614
03:04:25,050 --> 03:04:26,090
Yato Takoyaki.

3615
03:04:27,730 --> 03:04:28,650
Welcome to membership.

3616
03:04:28,770 --> 03:04:29,530
Thank you.

3617
03:04:30,850 --> 03:04:32,370
I pray to no sleep.

3618
03:04:33,350 --> 03:04:33,870
I pray to no sleep.

3619
03:04:33,890 --> 03:04:37,670
I'm in an open... invisible bed.

3620
03:04:39,070 --> 03:04:40,630
Freaky ghost bed.

3621
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:49,500
Virtual!

3622
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:50,720
Thanks for two months.

3623
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:55,300
Gosh, I can't believe it's been over two months since I've been back.

3624
03:04:57,920 --> 03:04:58,920
It's kinda crazy.

3625
03:04:59,280 --> 03:05:00,920
Soon to be three, right?

3626
03:05:01,140 --> 03:05:01,660
Cause...

3627
03:05:04,900 --> 03:05:07,620
You know, I guess if you count April 1st...

3628
03:05:10,420 --> 03:05:11,320
Take it in!

3629
03:05:13,960 --> 03:05:14,600
Perfect.

3630
03:05:16,240 --> 03:05:17,320
Perfect landing.

3631
03:05:19,940 --> 03:05:22,040
Can't believe it's only been two months.

3632
03:05:26,580 --> 03:05:27,860
It's already...

3633
03:05:29,220 --> 03:05:30,620
been two months.

3634
03:05:30,940 --> 03:05:33,580
I have to use this to call Minto cute before he's gone.

3635
03:05:34,680 --> 03:05:35,960
Stop it!

3636
03:05:41,620 --> 03:05:42,460
4-4.

3637
03:05:43,120 --> 03:05:44,580
4-4 is...

3638
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:53,720
It's funny because, you know, 4-4 is the day I stopped streaming.

3639
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:54,840
Before.

3640
03:05:55,840 --> 03:05:56,400
Before.

3641
03:05:59,340 --> 03:05:59,900
And...

3642
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:06,140
That is the day I returned to streaming, so it's just basically like...

3643
03:06:06,860 --> 03:06:09,200
Nothing ever changed, you know?

3644
03:06:09,880 --> 03:06:11,120
Nothing ever stopped.

3645
03:06:11,720 --> 03:06:12,660
Okay, hold on.

3646
03:06:12,660 --> 03:06:14,040
I'm looking at the picture real quick.

3647
03:06:14,180 --> 03:06:14,960
Oh, wrong picture.

3648
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:15,820
Oh, here we go.

3649
03:06:18,460 --> 03:06:19,940
So there's this...

3650
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:20,780
It's...

3651
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:22,700
Behind all of this.

3652
03:06:23,780 --> 03:06:24,820
Oh, I see it!

3653
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:28,800
I see it, I see it!

3654
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:29,440
Okay.

3655
03:06:35,280 --> 03:06:35,840
Let's...

3656
03:06:36,580 --> 03:06:36,860
Oh...

3657
03:06:37,860 --> 03:06:38,420
Uh...

3658
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:38,860
Uh...

3659
03:06:38,860 --> 03:06:39,340
Oh...

3660
03:06:39,340 --> 03:06:39,660
Oh...

3661
03:06:39,660 --> 03:06:39,860
Oh...

3662
03:06:42,980 --> 03:06:44,300
Happy Yuri Day?

3663
03:06:44,560 --> 03:06:45,120
No way.

3664
03:06:49,140 --> 03:06:50,100
Thank you.

3665
03:06:55,680 --> 03:06:58,850
Here we go.

3666
03:07:00,970 --> 03:07:02,370
Give me the real.

3667
03:07:03,750 --> 03:07:04,830
I turn around.

3668
03:07:06,490 --> 03:07:07,750
Don't be a little freak.

3669
03:07:07,950 --> 03:07:09,590
You better not be a freak when I turn around.

3670
03:07:10,150 --> 03:07:10,730
Ehehe.

3671
03:07:14,590 --> 03:07:15,210
Thank you.

3672
03:07:15,550 --> 03:07:18,790
Thank you.

3673
03:07:18,790 --> 03:07:19,270
Okay, now...

3674
03:07:19,270 --> 03:07:20,050
This one...

3675
03:07:20,050 --> 03:07:21,070
Oh, okay.

3676
03:07:21,190 --> 03:07:22,550
We have to...

3677
03:07:23,530 --> 03:07:24,810
I was gonna say...

3678
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:26,530
This one is a little, you know...

3679
03:07:26,530 --> 03:07:28,030
A little more difficult, I'd say.

3680
03:07:29,770 --> 03:07:30,950
Wait, what did I put down?

3681
03:07:31,150 --> 03:07:33,330
I didn't have anything...

3682
03:07:33,330 --> 03:07:33,590
Did I?

3683
03:07:35,590 --> 03:07:36,410
Oh, the lantern.

3684
03:07:36,630 --> 03:07:37,230
Okay, we don't care.

3685
03:07:37,990 --> 03:07:38,550
We're good.

3686
03:07:39,670 --> 03:07:40,310
Two months?

3687
03:07:40,350 --> 03:07:41,030
Here's too many more.

3688
03:07:41,110 --> 03:07:41,690
Mint is cute.

3689
03:07:41,790 --> 03:07:42,230
Stop!

3690
03:07:42,710 --> 03:07:43,150
Oh, the lantern.

3691
03:07:43,150 --> 03:07:43,590
I love it!

3692
03:07:49,060 --> 03:07:49,900
What's over here?

3693
03:07:53,500 --> 03:07:54,460
How mysterious!

3694
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:56,940
This is kind of fun.

3695
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:59,080
Does this also lead to the projection room?

3696
03:08:03,140 --> 03:08:05,920
Which, if it does, we'll just go back for that lantern.

3697
03:08:12,260 --> 03:08:12,740
Yes.

3698
03:08:18,700 --> 03:08:19,220
Yippee!

3699
03:08:23,540 --> 03:08:25,560
Everything is like opening and closing.

3700
03:08:25,980 --> 03:08:29,860
What an inefficient... You could just go into anybody's house, honestly.

3701
03:08:30,900 --> 03:08:31,880
Where was the door?

3702
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:32,200
Oh, here.

3703
03:08:32,960 --> 03:08:33,480
Nice!

3704
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:37,460
Alright, let's go get the lantern from in here.

3705
03:08:38,380 --> 03:08:40,700
Now my contact is starting to bother me.

3706
03:08:41,280 --> 03:08:43,700
I got new contacts for my new prescription.

3707
03:08:44,900 --> 03:08:47,640
And they're like better quality, so that they're...

3708
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:52,740
So that they keep my eyes moist.

3709
03:08:54,180 --> 03:08:54,700
But...

3710
03:08:58,020 --> 03:08:58,540
But...

3711
03:08:59,100 --> 03:09:07,440
I have so many contacts of my other prescription, my older prescription, that I'm like, I have to use them, or else they'll go to waste.

3712
03:09:07,740 --> 03:09:09,440
But they make my eyes so dry.

3713
03:09:11,960 --> 03:09:16,480
I haven't even gotten the other ones, because I was supposed to have them before Japan, but...

3714
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:18,920
They called me while I was in Japan.

3715
03:09:19,320 --> 03:09:21,100
Because I hadn't even arrived yet.

3716
03:09:22,140 --> 03:09:23,340
And now...

3717
03:09:24,200 --> 03:09:27,280
I came back and I had COVID, so I couldn't even go get them.

3718
03:09:27,860 --> 03:09:28,460
Okay.

3719
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:31,780
The first...

3720
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:34,500
On the first seal of...

3721
03:09:36,520 --> 03:09:37,120
Strangerville...

3722
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:40,680
My true safe said to me...

3723
03:09:42,140 --> 03:09:45,040
Your RV isn't working.

3724
03:09:45,500 --> 03:09:46,700
No, don't go in reverse!

3725
03:09:46,860 --> 03:09:47,400
Don't go in reverse!

3726
03:09:47,560 --> 03:09:47,980
Wait, wait, wait.

3727
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:48,420
Hold on.

3728
03:09:50,580 --> 03:09:51,100
Hold on.

3729
03:09:51,220 --> 03:09:51,780
I have to...

3730
03:09:51,780 --> 03:09:53,260
I have to reprogram it.

3731
03:09:53,340 --> 03:09:54,960
Why is it happening like this...

3732
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:55,660
This time?

3733
03:09:55,760 --> 03:09:56,320
It's so weird.

3734
03:09:56,680 --> 03:09:59,740
Here, let me turn the active controller on and off again.

3735
03:10:08,880 --> 03:10:09,500
There we go.

3736
03:10:10,560 --> 03:10:10,960
Okay.

3737
03:10:11,080 --> 03:10:12,600
We got a grabby grab.

3738
03:10:15,140 --> 03:10:15,940
I don't...

3739
03:10:17,480 --> 03:10:19,300
Recognize this place as much.

3740
03:10:20,220 --> 03:10:20,940
There we go.

3741
03:10:20,940 --> 03:10:21,360
Pause...

3742
03:10:23,900 --> 03:10:24,420
Oh!

3743
03:10:26,620 --> 03:10:28,300
This is where they do the concert.

3744
03:10:32,310 --> 03:10:33,190
What the...

3745
03:10:37,590 --> 03:10:38,610
Bug feet.

3746
03:10:38,890 --> 03:10:39,710
No, it's okay.

3747
03:10:39,830 --> 03:10:40,330
Also...

3748
03:10:40,330 --> 03:10:42,770
It's the alt tab losing app focus thing.

3749
03:10:42,950 --> 03:10:44,350
That makes sense.

3750
03:10:44,470 --> 03:10:44,870
That makes sense.

3751
03:10:47,210 --> 03:10:49,230
How am I supposed to do that one?

3752
03:10:49,910 --> 03:10:50,430
Okay.

3753
03:10:51,070 --> 03:10:51,590
Interesting.

3754
03:10:52,490 --> 03:10:53,270
All right.

3755
03:10:53,270 --> 03:11:00,830
Let's go figure out the final puzzle of the other thing.

3756
03:11:08,180 --> 03:11:08,580
Yeah.

3757
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:09,600
How am I supposed to...

3758
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:11,540
Just walk into the fire?

3759
03:11:11,740 --> 03:11:13,640
No, but how am I supposed to sneak past them?

3760
03:11:14,060 --> 03:11:16,000
Maybe if I walk into the fire...

3761
03:11:18,360 --> 03:11:20,060
Like, I kind of just stood there before.

3762
03:11:21,180 --> 03:11:23,360
I kind of just stood there and let them take me.

3763
03:11:23,880 --> 03:11:24,480
You know?

3764
03:11:25,260 --> 03:11:27,120
Maybe it wasn't my most proudest moment.

3765
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:29,160
But then

3766
03:11:43,300 --> 03:11:43,380
I decided I was doing my best.

3767
03:11:43,400 --> 03:11:43,620
I think I just need to...

3768
03:11:43,620 --> 03:11:44,040
Um...

3769
03:11:48,140 --> 03:11:49,060
Come back!

3770
03:11:49,220 --> 03:11:50,060
Don't run me over!

3771
03:11:51,140 --> 03:11:52,060
Okay, we're good.

3772
03:11:52,600 --> 03:11:53,560
Everything's fine, you guys.

3773
03:12:00,440 --> 03:12:01,360
Town down.

3774
03:12:23,210 --> 03:12:24,890
I felt like that was...

3775
03:12:24,890 --> 03:12:27,510
I like, literally felt like a tumbleweed there, you know?

3776
03:12:27,570 --> 03:12:28,710
I'm so sad.

3777
03:12:29,670 --> 03:12:30,130
Okay.

3778
03:12:30,250 --> 03:12:30,690
Way to go!

3779
03:12:30,690 --> 03:12:31,370
Here we go.

3780
03:12:32,050 --> 03:12:32,770
Here we go.

3781
03:12:32,970 --> 03:12:33,550
Come on.

3782
03:12:43,560 --> 03:12:44,360
We're all good.

3783
03:12:44,460 --> 03:12:45,640
Yeah, just a couple of concussions.

3784
03:12:48,520 --> 03:12:50,080
Concussions for science, everybody.

3785
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:54,520
Concussions are fine if you learn after them.

3786
03:12:55,480 --> 03:12:58,820
If you learn things because of your concussion.

3787
03:13:01,140 --> 03:13:01,960
It's all good.

3788
03:13:07,300 --> 03:13:08,220
This dang...

3789
03:13:10,820 --> 03:13:11,440
Confound it.

3790
03:13:13,400 --> 03:13:15,420
That hole's too small for me.

3791
03:13:18,600 --> 03:13:19,740
I'm a thick boy.

3792
03:13:23,860 --> 03:13:25,340
Yes, I learned English again.

3793
03:13:33,880 --> 03:13:35,840
If there's a hole, there's a way.

3794
03:13:36,560 --> 03:13:38,580
Something, something, hole, goal.

3795
03:13:39,080 --> 03:13:42,200
I get it.

3796
03:13:42,240 --> 03:13:42,680
I get it.

3797
03:13:44,720 --> 03:13:48,220
I think outside

3798
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:53,400
the box.

3799
03:13:56,620 --> 03:14:00,180
The only thing I can think of is involving an elevator.

3800
03:14:00,500 --> 03:14:02,240
There's not even a door to open.

3801
03:14:08,560 --> 03:14:09,520
Wait a second.

3802
03:14:12,860 --> 03:14:13,340
Whee!

3803
03:14:15,020 --> 03:14:15,700
I'm okay.

3804
03:14:20,290 --> 03:14:21,510
I did it.

3805
03:14:22,550 --> 03:14:23,570
And I didn't die.

3806
03:14:23,630 --> 03:14:25,050
Can you imagine if I had died there?

3807
03:14:27,150 --> 03:14:29,110
Can you imagine if I had died there?

3808
03:14:29,190 --> 03:14:30,810
That would have been pretty embarrassing.

3809
03:14:32,250 --> 03:14:32,670
What's up here?

3810
03:14:33,930 --> 03:14:35,690
Okay, that's our secret tunnel.

3811
03:14:36,410 --> 03:14:38,050
Just minor leg damage.

3812
03:14:38,330 --> 03:14:38,910
That's our thing.

3813
03:14:40,230 --> 03:14:42,130
Oh, there's even like a...

3814
03:14:42,130 --> 03:14:45,590
Is that our way out?

3815
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:51,640
If there's a freak, I'm gonna be...

3816
03:14:52,880 --> 03:14:54,600
a little upset.

3817
03:14:55,180 --> 03:14:58,160
Okay, so I probably have to...

3818
03:14:59,060 --> 03:15:00,340
launch the...

3819
03:15:01,320 --> 03:15:01,880
Oh.

3820
03:15:02,420 --> 03:15:03,720
I just have to guess.

3821
03:15:08,660 --> 03:15:09,220
Nice.

3822
03:15:10,220 --> 03:15:11,900
Guys, I'm a bit of a genius.

3823
03:15:15,260 --> 03:15:16,660
I'm a bit of a genius.

3824
03:15:19,300 --> 03:15:20,420
Gaming skill.

3825
03:15:22,680 --> 03:15:23,520
I know.

3826
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:24,500
I know.

3827
03:15:25,620 --> 03:15:26,460
I know.

3828
03:15:26,860 --> 03:15:27,360
I know.

3829
03:15:28,700 --> 03:15:29,540
I know.

3830
03:15:29,660 --> 03:15:29,860
I know.

3831
03:15:31,340 --> 03:15:31,980
Genius.

3832
03:15:32,860 --> 03:15:35,080
I'm a genius idol.

3833
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:41,320
What did you eat today?

3834
03:15:41,400 --> 03:15:42,520
What's your favorite book?

3835
03:15:42,840 --> 03:15:45,240
If you're going to play, where are you going?

3836
03:15:45,480 --> 03:15:46,720
You haven't eaten anything.

3837
03:15:47,060 --> 03:15:48,040
That's a secret.

3838
03:15:49,180 --> 03:15:50,520
Can't wait for season two.

3839
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:53,200
I...

3840
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:54,340
Yeah.

3841
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:55,260
I'm...

3842
03:15:57,060 --> 03:15:59,480
I haven't read the manga, but I do have someone like...

3843
03:15:59,480 --> 03:16:01,340
like a friend that will kind of...

3844
03:16:01,340 --> 03:16:03,180
They'll be like, do you want a spoiler?

3845
03:16:03,520 --> 03:16:04,480
And I'm like, okay.

3846
03:16:07,340 --> 03:16:07,700
Usually...

3847
03:16:07,700 --> 03:16:11,200
Usually I would say no, but I wasn't sure if I was going to continue the series.

3848
03:16:14,940 --> 03:16:15,300
Actually...

3849
03:16:15,300 --> 03:16:16,080
Actually, wait.

3850
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:18,540
Now that I think about it, I don't know at all what the second arc is about.

3851
03:16:20,040 --> 03:16:21,060
Is that friend Mata?

3852
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:23,520
Why?

3853
03:16:24,360 --> 03:16:26,780
Is Mata always spoiling things to shows?

3854
03:16:29,480 --> 03:16:30,460
Okie dokie.

3855
03:16:30,680 --> 03:16:31,140
All right.

3856
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:33,600
Where's our...

3857
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:35,640
next...

3858
03:16:36,280 --> 03:16:36,700
thing?

3859
03:16:37,380 --> 03:16:38,700
The third.

3860
03:16:43,960 --> 03:16:44,380
Okay.

3861
03:16:44,540 --> 03:16:45,540
Very helpful.

3862
03:16:45,800 --> 03:16:47,180
They're just in pure darkness.

3863
03:16:49,060 --> 03:16:51,820
This is where they were doing the recital.

3864
03:16:51,980 --> 03:16:53,140
And then...

3865
03:16:59,560 --> 03:17:01,240
Shut up.

3866
03:17:03,980 --> 03:17:04,820
Oof.

3867
03:17:06,940 --> 03:17:08,260
He's taking it to the tree.

3868
03:17:11,480 --> 03:17:12,080
Never mind.

3869
03:17:12,340 --> 03:17:12,780
Yes.

3870
03:17:13,380 --> 03:17:13,820
Wow.

3871
03:17:14,280 --> 03:17:14,720
Wait.

3872
03:17:14,900 --> 03:17:15,960
That was in the tower.

3873
03:17:16,960 --> 03:17:17,980
Oh my goodness.

3874
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:18,960
Okay.

3875
03:17:20,620 --> 03:17:21,700
That one we can do.

3876
03:17:25,300 --> 03:17:26,640
An invisible bridge.

3877
03:17:27,540 --> 03:17:28,660
Sleeping in your bed.

3878
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:29,640
Okay.

3879
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:29,920
Okay.

3880
03:17:29,980 --> 03:17:30,180
Okay.

3881
03:17:36,760 --> 03:17:37,520
Wait, though.

3882
03:17:37,540 --> 03:17:37,940
Hold on.

3883
03:17:37,980 --> 03:17:38,300
I'm thinking.

3884
03:17:42,300 --> 03:17:44,780
That's why the boats are so important.

3885
03:17:46,920 --> 03:17:47,400
Okay.

3886
03:17:47,960 --> 03:17:50,420
Because I was like, how do I get to the tower?

3887
03:17:51,260 --> 03:17:52,700
It was in the tower, right?

3888
03:17:52,840 --> 03:17:53,540
Oh my gosh.

3889
03:17:53,620 --> 03:17:53,760
Whoa.

3890
03:17:53,840 --> 03:17:54,240
This is...

3891
03:17:54,240 --> 03:17:54,680
Hold on.

3892
03:17:54,760 --> 03:17:56,080
This is a lot of...

3893
03:17:56,080 --> 03:17:56,380
Okay.

3894
03:17:56,980 --> 03:17:57,940
Oh, geez.

3895
03:17:58,060 --> 03:17:58,400
Okay.

3896
03:17:58,440 --> 03:18:01,020
I might have to write like this step by step because...

3897
03:18:02,120 --> 03:18:03,100
Oh, goodness.

3898
03:18:05,300 --> 03:18:05,780
Okay.

3899
03:18:08,520 --> 03:18:09,000
Right.

3900
03:18:09,260 --> 03:18:09,740
Okay.

3901
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:10,240
No.

3902
03:18:10,320 --> 03:18:11,140
It was the lodge.

3903
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:11,580
It was.

3904
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:13,520
Oh, you're right.

3905
03:18:13,940 --> 03:18:16,200
It was the lodge, right?

3906
03:18:16,480 --> 03:18:16,920
Because...

3907
03:18:28,850 --> 03:18:29,290
We...

3908
03:18:32,510 --> 03:18:36,550
Sneaked past the guy and then we saw the mural in the basement.

3909
03:18:38,050 --> 03:18:38,490
Yes.

3910
03:18:38,710 --> 03:18:39,150
Yes.

3911
03:18:39,250 --> 03:18:39,570
Yes.

3912
03:18:39,570 --> 03:18:39,890
Yes.

3913
03:18:39,890 --> 03:18:40,190
Yes.

3914
03:18:40,350 --> 03:18:40,790
Okay.

3915
03:18:41,010 --> 03:18:41,250
Okay.

3916
03:18:41,270 --> 03:18:41,490
Okay.

3917
03:18:41,490 --> 03:18:41,490
Okay.

3918
03:18:41,830 --> 03:18:42,430
Hello?

3919
03:18:43,050 --> 03:18:43,650
There it is.

3920
03:18:52,300 --> 03:18:53,080
Oh gosh.

3921
03:19:00,220 --> 03:19:01,260
That was spooky.

3922
03:19:02,120 --> 03:19:03,740
OBS disconnected for a second?

3923
03:19:11,690 --> 03:19:12,550
Everything good?

3924
03:19:12,670 --> 03:19:13,430
Everything alright?

3925
03:19:13,570 --> 03:19:14,110
You guys okay?

3926
03:19:15,350 --> 03:19:15,950
OBS.

3927
03:19:16,110 --> 03:19:16,410
OBS.

3928
03:19:17,130 --> 03:19:18,850
OBS disconnected for a second.

3929
03:19:19,370 --> 03:19:20,070
Very spooky.

3930
03:19:21,810 --> 03:19:24,210
I don't remember where this one leads us to.

3931
03:19:25,890 --> 03:19:26,930
Small F.

3932
03:19:28,470 --> 03:19:28,990
Yes.

3933
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:30,790
Small F.

3934
03:19:42,740 --> 03:19:43,640
It is...

3935
03:19:44,440 --> 03:19:45,300
Oh my goodness.

3936
03:19:45,420 --> 03:19:46,260
That spooked me.

3937
03:19:49,360 --> 03:19:50,500
It's this one, right?

3938
03:19:59,480 --> 03:20:00,380
They're yelling?

3939
03:20:00,940 --> 03:20:02,140
Or they're dying?

3940
03:20:02,400 --> 03:20:03,520
I can't tell actually.

3941
03:20:03,860 --> 03:20:05,020
Maybe they're dying.

3942
03:20:05,300 --> 03:20:06,740
Maybe there are fires going out.

3943
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:11,260
Wait, that means that they would be...

3944
03:20:11,260 --> 03:20:14,100
There wouldn't be any guys walking around then, right?

3945
03:20:14,400 --> 03:20:17,220
If there are fires go out...

3946
03:20:22,110 --> 03:20:23,130
Did I guess it?

3947
03:20:25,430 --> 03:20:26,730
Did I get it correct?

3948
03:20:27,930 --> 03:20:28,890
Maybe... genius?

3949
03:20:31,650 --> 03:20:32,130
Maybe...

3950
03:20:35,710 --> 03:20:36,970
Are you obsessed with me?

3951
03:20:43,850 --> 03:20:44,530
Let's see.

3952
03:20:45,030 --> 03:20:46,510
Well, this guy is still here.

3953
03:20:48,250 --> 03:20:50,210
This guy... What's your dealio?

3954
03:20:51,110 --> 03:20:55,790
He's watching the best 5 frames per second livestream of his life.

3955
03:20:56,650 --> 03:20:57,630
It's his favorite.

3956
03:21:00,050 --> 03:21:01,010
Okay, let's see.

3957
03:21:01,250 --> 03:21:02,290
I'm just happy.

3958
03:21:06,110 --> 03:21:09,050
Well, I guess we'll figure... We'll find out soon enough.

3959
03:21:09,490 --> 03:21:10,270
Right here.

3960
03:21:13,090 --> 03:21:13,630
No!

3961
03:21:13,850 --> 03:21:14,650
He's still going!

3962
03:21:15,350 --> 03:21:15,890
Interesting.

3963
03:21:16,070 --> 03:21:17,150
But someone's dying.

3964
03:21:18,270 --> 03:21:19,450
Someone is dead.

3965
03:21:21,970 --> 03:21:24,690
Oh, I don't know why I'm here just yet.

3966
03:21:25,170 --> 03:21:25,710
Because...

3967
03:21:26,270 --> 03:21:27,130
Okay, okay.

3968
03:21:27,170 --> 03:21:27,530
Hold on.

3969
03:21:28,830 --> 03:21:31,570
I don't even remember what the order was.

3970
03:21:34,010 --> 03:21:35,550
Can I jump down from here?

3971
03:21:38,720 --> 03:21:39,840
I just realized.

3972
03:21:42,920 --> 03:21:43,440
Oh, no.

3973
03:21:43,540 --> 03:21:44,480
I go into the water.

3974
03:21:57,970 --> 03:21:58,330
Raiders!

3975
03:21:58,330 --> 03:21:58,950
Thank you!

3976
03:22:00,190 --> 03:22:01,010
Thank you for the raid!

3977
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:02,350
Sorry, I didn't see who it was.

3978
03:22:02,390 --> 03:22:03,010
But thank you!

3979
03:22:03,090 --> 03:22:03,610
Thank you, thank you!

3980
03:22:04,210 --> 03:22:05,270
Go to the recital.

3981
03:22:05,390 --> 03:22:05,770
That's right.

3982
03:22:06,350 --> 03:22:08,410
But that wasn't like a completely...

3983
03:22:08,410 --> 03:22:09,530
Do I have enough time?

3984
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:10,070
I wonder.

3985
03:22:11,070 --> 03:22:11,950
I guess we'll see.

3986
03:22:12,650 --> 03:22:13,530
To the recital.

3987
03:22:13,830 --> 03:22:14,970
We have to go take a boat.

3988
03:22:16,730 --> 03:22:17,090
Which...

3989
03:22:18,210 --> 03:22:19,510
Where is a boat around here?

3990
03:22:20,990 --> 03:22:21,350
Anyway...

3991
03:22:26,150 --> 03:22:26,930
Oh, wait.

3992
03:22:27,030 --> 03:22:28,130
It was upstairs, wasn't it?

3993
03:22:28,150 --> 03:22:28,470
My bad.

3994
03:22:31,470 --> 03:22:31,830
No!

3995
03:22:32,350 --> 03:22:33,570
Thanks for the five gifted!

3996
03:22:35,050 --> 03:22:35,790
Thank you, guys.

3997
03:22:37,810 --> 03:22:38,590
Thank you, thank you.

3998
03:22:41,510 --> 03:22:42,770
I don't know who raided me.

3999
03:22:42,850 --> 03:22:43,450
But thank you so much.

4000
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:48,780
We're playing a kind of spooky game.

4001
03:22:49,040 --> 03:22:49,480
So...

4002
03:22:49,480 --> 03:22:51,580
If that's not your style...

4003
03:22:52,200 --> 03:22:52,640
Then...

4004
03:22:53,400 --> 03:22:54,200
See you later.

4005
03:22:56,460 --> 03:22:56,900
Wait!

4006
03:22:57,100 --> 03:22:57,620
I remember!

4007
03:22:57,760 --> 03:22:58,700
There was a boat over here.

4008
03:22:58,820 --> 03:22:59,280
That's right.

4009
03:22:59,540 --> 03:23:00,980
There was a boat down here.

4010
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:01,400
I remember.

4011
03:23:01,760 --> 03:23:02,200
Nexy!

4012
03:23:02,360 --> 03:23:03,360
Thanks for the five gifted!

4013
03:23:04,680 --> 03:23:06,660
My brain has been expanding.

4014
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:09,140
Wait, it was over here, wasn't it?

4015
03:23:10,880 --> 03:23:11,580
Maybe I...

4016
03:23:12,660 --> 03:23:13,100
Wrong.

4017
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:13,800
Maybe.

4018
03:23:15,080 --> 03:23:16,240
The boat was the other way.

4019
03:23:16,380 --> 03:23:18,100
I thought there was one...

4020
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:22,080
Oh, here, here, here.

4021
03:23:22,940 --> 03:23:24,000
Here, here, here, here, here.

4022
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:26,580
Okay.

4023
03:23:27,080 --> 03:23:27,900
We got this.

4024
03:23:28,640 --> 03:23:29,860
We have to go...

4025
03:23:31,640 --> 03:23:33,400
Down, down, down by the river.

4026
03:23:39,590 --> 03:23:39,990
Here.

4027
03:23:45,790 --> 03:23:46,190
Okay.

4028
03:23:47,250 --> 03:23:47,970
Right?

4029
03:23:52,540 --> 03:23:53,300
Yes!

4030
03:23:55,020 --> 03:23:56,740
Oh, will we have time?

4031
03:23:58,040 --> 03:23:59,700
If I'm speedy...

4032
03:23:59,700 --> 03:24:00,100
Maybe.

4033
03:24:00,760 --> 03:24:02,140
It's got to be speed.

4034
03:24:05,120 --> 03:24:05,880
Okay.

4035
03:24:09,620 --> 03:24:11,300
Unless it's here...

4036
03:24:11,300 --> 03:24:12,200
Wait, where are you heading to?

4037
03:24:17,120 --> 03:24:17,880
It's...

4038
03:24:21,320 --> 03:24:22,420
The music said...

4039
03:24:24,120 --> 03:24:25,340
It was this bar?

4040
03:24:26,500 --> 03:24:27,240
It was?

4041
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:28,640
Wait.

4042
03:24:28,780 --> 03:24:29,760
I thought the...

4043
03:24:32,640 --> 03:24:34,660
I thought it was...

4044
03:24:37,980 --> 03:24:38,900
Minto lost.

4045
03:24:40,540 --> 03:24:41,460
No help.

4046
03:24:41,720 --> 03:24:41,920
No!

4047
03:24:42,280 --> 03:24:43,460
This is find help.

4048
03:24:44,300 --> 03:24:44,860
Wait.

4049
03:24:44,980 --> 03:24:45,920
I thought it was...

4050
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:46,720
Um...

4051
03:24:47,280 --> 03:24:48,400
I wasn't think...

4052
03:24:48,400 --> 03:24:50,360
I thought it was in the same area as the first...

4053
03:24:50,360 --> 03:24:51,260
As the big recital.

4054
03:24:51,940 --> 03:24:54,660
As like a little tiny place to the left.

4055
03:24:57,140 --> 03:24:57,740
Okay.

4056
03:24:58,280 --> 03:25:01,080
I understand the error of my ways.

4057
03:25:02,140 --> 03:25:03,240
Wait, so it's...

4058
03:25:06,770 --> 03:25:07,870
Around this way?

4059
03:25:08,170 --> 03:25:08,770
No.

4060
03:25:09,410 --> 03:25:10,010
Uh...

4061
03:25:10,010 --> 03:25:11,510
I forgot how to get there.

4062
03:25:13,410 --> 03:25:14,010
Uh...

4063
03:25:14,770 --> 03:25:15,290
Wait a minute.

4064
03:25:17,450 --> 03:25:18,390
Wait a minute.

4065
03:25:18,750 --> 03:25:19,310
Wait a minute.

4066
03:25:22,430 --> 03:25:23,610
I wish I could open this.

4067
03:25:23,690 --> 03:25:24,970
Well, maybe I don't wish I could open...

4068
03:25:24,970 --> 03:25:25,350
I don't know.

4069
03:25:25,390 --> 03:25:25,830
I don't know.

4070
03:25:25,910 --> 03:25:27,490
I don't want to wish anything in this area.

4071
03:25:27,910 --> 03:25:28,750
It's too spooky.

4072
03:25:31,050 --> 03:25:31,410
Wait.

4073
03:25:46,550 --> 03:25:47,570
Was it through here?

4074
03:25:49,410 --> 03:25:50,990
Trying to figure out how to...

4075
03:25:50,990 --> 03:25:51,290
No?

4076
03:25:51,890 --> 03:25:52,410
Hold on.

4077
03:25:52,510 --> 03:25:53,630
Let me go back to the very beginning.

4078
03:25:59,650 --> 03:26:00,670
I don't die here though.

4079
03:26:00,930 --> 03:26:01,470
I think.

4080
03:26:04,790 --> 03:26:05,510
Oh, shoot.

4081
03:26:05,550 --> 03:26:06,290
I have to go...

4082
03:26:06,290 --> 03:26:06,450
Oh, shoot.

4083
03:26:06,470 --> 03:26:06,750
Oh, my God.

4084
03:26:06,890 --> 03:26:07,090
I'm...

4085
03:26:08,590 --> 03:26:09,390
I keep...

4086
03:26:09,390 --> 03:26:10,250
Sorry, guys.

4087
03:26:10,290 --> 03:26:10,830
My brain.

4088
03:26:11,010 --> 03:26:11,710
I'm so sorry.

4089
03:26:13,310 --> 03:26:14,090
I'm like, yeah.

4090
03:26:14,150 --> 03:26:16,070
I have to go all the way up so that I can...

4091
03:26:18,350 --> 03:26:19,370
Go to the hand.

4092
03:26:20,710 --> 03:26:21,110
Oh...

4093
03:26:22,390 --> 03:26:23,190
Tensai deactivated.

4094
03:26:32,820 --> 03:26:33,740
There we go.

4095
03:26:41,480 --> 03:26:44,300
So around here...

4096
03:26:47,280 --> 03:26:47,680
Uh...

4097
03:26:47,680 --> 03:26:48,360
Wasn't it...

4098
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:49,960
Maybe it is on the side.

4099
03:26:50,420 --> 03:26:50,820
Oh...

4100
03:26:52,520 --> 03:26:53,300
Or wait.

4101
03:26:55,960 --> 03:26:58,380
Yeah, because that...

4102
03:26:58,960 --> 03:26:59,520
Oh...

4103
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:00,580
That blue...

4104
03:27:00,580 --> 03:27:02,260
That turned on the bridge.

4105
03:27:03,500 --> 03:27:04,340
Are you...

4106
03:27:04,340 --> 03:27:04,740
Eh?

4107
03:27:07,620 --> 03:27:08,180
Oh!

4108
03:27:08,580 --> 03:27:10,500
Do I need to go that way?

4109
03:27:10,620 --> 03:27:10,900
There.

4110
03:27:10,940 --> 03:27:11,320
Up there.

4111
03:27:12,100 --> 03:27:13,880
I know it's over here.

4112
03:27:13,980 --> 03:27:14,480
Right?

4113
03:27:14,580 --> 03:27:15,980
Like, it's over there...

4114
03:27:16,580 --> 03:27:17,140
Somewhere.

4115
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:19,860
It's over there.

4116
03:27:20,260 --> 03:27:20,820
Somewhere.

4117
03:27:20,840 --> 03:27:24,840
I think the bridge just fell.

4118
03:27:26,960 --> 03:27:29,120
I think I was too slow.

4119
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:31,540
Here we go.

4120
03:27:32,480 --> 03:27:33,080
Okay.

4121
03:27:34,100 --> 03:27:35,180
It was here?

4122
03:27:36,620 --> 03:27:37,640
Where was...

4123
03:27:37,640 --> 03:27:38,640
What was the spot, though?

4124
03:27:39,420 --> 03:27:40,620
Oh, I don't remember.

4125
03:27:42,600 --> 03:27:43,200
Here?

4126
03:27:43,820 --> 03:27:45,280
They did something?

4127
03:27:51,860 --> 03:27:53,040
Well, I found it.

4128
03:27:53,320 --> 03:27:53,920
But...

4129
03:27:54,660 --> 03:27:55,260
Okay.

4130
03:27:55,280 --> 03:27:56,400
I'm not sure what to do here.

4131
03:27:56,540 --> 03:27:57,280
Near the edge.

4132
03:27:57,480 --> 03:27:58,020
That's right!

4133
03:27:58,120 --> 03:28:00,960
We walk to the other side.

4134
03:28:04,460 --> 03:28:04,860
We...

4135
03:28:04,860 --> 03:28:05,520
We'll come back.

4136
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:06,200
That's right.

4137
03:28:06,260 --> 03:28:07,220
We walk to the other side.

4138
03:28:07,720 --> 03:28:10,620
And then we blow this out.

4139
03:28:17,510 --> 03:28:19,370
I don't think they like that very much.

4140
03:28:23,940 --> 03:28:24,340
Whoa!

4141
03:28:25,960 --> 03:28:26,360
Wow!

4142
03:28:27,160 --> 03:28:27,560
Neat!

4143
03:28:29,320 --> 03:28:30,620
Are they going to be walking around?

4144
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:30,880
I don't know.

4145
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:35,440
Are they going to be walking around in here now?

4146
03:28:41,270 --> 03:28:41,810
It's okay.

4147
03:28:41,910 --> 03:28:42,350
Just run.

4148
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:56,500
Where did the bridge go?

4149
03:28:58,460 --> 03:28:59,260
Oh God.

4150
03:28:59,740 --> 03:29:00,820
That's so rude.

4151
03:29:00,900 --> 03:29:03,040
It blows out all the candles in the house.

4152
03:29:03,360 --> 03:29:08,400
So it blows out the bridge.

4153
03:29:08,660 --> 03:29:10,480
So I have to go do it again anyway.

4154
03:29:17,850 --> 03:29:21,090
Do you think love can bloom even in the outer wilds?

4155
03:29:22,290 --> 03:29:23,330
It's a great question.

4156
03:29:24,230 --> 03:29:25,470
I'm just going to wait to die.

4157
03:29:27,150 --> 03:29:27,950
Oh man.

4158
03:29:28,970 --> 03:29:30,750
And I also have to go to the bathroom.

4159
03:29:31,030 --> 03:29:34,390
So I will do that too.

4160
03:29:38,580 --> 03:29:40,600
You have to do it while they're looking for you.

4161
03:29:40,680 --> 03:29:41,100
I know.

4162
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:42,660
They're going to be walking around.

4163
03:29:43,100 --> 03:29:43,960
There's going to be time.

4164
03:29:43,980 --> 03:29:44,520
There's two of them.

4165
03:29:45,940 --> 03:29:46,740
Oh no.

4166
03:29:46,840 --> 03:29:50,980
At least I know the layout pretty well at this point, but...

4167
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:15,960
He's going to be mad because he turned off his show.

4168
03:30:17,780 --> 03:30:18,180
No.

4169
03:30:18,180 --> 03:30:19,120
Stop the stream.

4170
03:30:27,030 --> 03:30:28,770
Here's where the real stealth happens.

4171
03:30:34,680 --> 03:30:37,480
I can see a lot of progress is going to be made in this run.

4172
03:30:37,620 --> 03:30:39,380
Well, I'm hoping to beat it.

4173
03:30:40,700 --> 03:30:45,640
That's why I'm like, even if I play for 12 hours, I'm hoping to beat it.

4174
03:30:45,720 --> 03:30:46,940
But I do have to go to the bathroom.

4175
03:30:47,560 --> 03:30:48,840
So I'm going to go do that.

4176
03:30:49,100 --> 03:30:50,540
I'm going to go potty real quick.

4177
03:30:50,640 --> 03:30:52,520
I'm going to go to the little ghosty's room.

4178
03:30:52,640 --> 03:30:53,180
Oh gosh.

4179
03:30:55,100 --> 03:30:58,560
That means all three of them are going to be stealthy.

4180
03:31:01,300 --> 03:31:03,000
All three of them are going to be...

4181
03:31:05,380 --> 03:31:07,200
And they're spooky stealthy.

4182
03:31:07,220 --> 03:31:09,180
It's like the worst kind of stealthy.

4183
03:31:09,180 --> 03:31:11,180
It's my least favorite kind of stealthy.

4184
03:31:11,240 --> 03:31:13,240
It's like spooky stealthy.

4185
03:31:15,480 --> 03:31:17,180
It's not as bad as it seems now.

4186
03:31:17,400 --> 03:31:17,720
Okay.

4187
03:31:17,820 --> 03:31:18,600
I'll trust you.

4188
03:31:20,820 --> 03:31:21,900
I'll trust you.

4189
03:31:23,200 --> 03:31:23,720
Okay.

4190
03:31:23,800 --> 03:31:24,440
I'll be right back.

4191
03:31:25,400 --> 03:31:26,480
You guys can...

4192
03:31:27,380 --> 03:31:30,540
roast your marshmallows and have a...

4193
03:31:32,000 --> 03:31:34,180
Have a delightful time.

4194
03:31:34,660 --> 03:31:37,480
I guess we'll go back to that one first because...

4195
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:40,080
I...

4196
03:31:40,900 --> 03:31:42,400
know what to do...

4197
03:31:43,140 --> 03:31:44,420
immediately with that one.

4198
03:31:45,100 --> 03:31:45,980
We'll do that one.

4199
03:31:46,160 --> 03:31:47,680
Maybe then we'll do the giant...

4200
03:31:47,680 --> 03:31:48,880
The opera house.

4201
03:31:49,100 --> 03:31:50,840
And then maybe we'll do the third one.

4202
03:31:50,920 --> 03:31:52,560
Because I still don't know what to do with that.

4203
03:31:52,700 --> 03:31:54,160
Like how to get down to the hole.

4204
03:31:59,640 --> 03:32:02,880
There's a way to bypass every spooky section of the game with puzzle solving.

4205
03:32:03,240 --> 03:32:03,640
What?

4206
03:32:04,140 --> 03:32:04,540
What?

4207
03:32:04,780 --> 03:32:05,180
What?

4208
03:32:05,560 --> 03:32:05,960
What?

4209
03:32:06,460 --> 03:32:06,860
What?

4210
03:32:06,860 --> 03:32:06,960
What?

4211
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:12,940
Oh, are you saying like I sequence break and I figure out how to do everything without being told what to do?

4212
03:32:14,040 --> 03:32:15,100
That is not true.

4213
03:32:15,220 --> 03:32:15,820
Oh, just kidding.

4214
03:32:16,140 --> 03:32:17,660
Hey, stop one-guying me.

4215
03:32:18,060 --> 03:32:18,500
Everybody...

4216
03:32:18,500 --> 03:32:19,140
Wait, who said that?

4217
03:32:20,720 --> 03:32:21,580
Who said that?

4218
03:32:26,900 --> 03:32:27,340
More...

4219
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:28,600
people?

4220
03:32:28,920 --> 03:32:29,460
More people!

4221
03:32:31,460 --> 03:32:32,560
Why would you...

4222
03:32:32,560 --> 03:32:33,420
Why would you...

4223
03:32:33,420 --> 03:32:34,140
Why would you...

4224
03:32:35,040 --> 03:32:35,480
Why?

4225
03:32:36,060 --> 03:32:36,800
Why you?

4226
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:38,560
Why you?

4227
03:32:39,580 --> 03:32:40,300
Why would you?

4228
03:32:43,380 --> 03:32:44,100
Why you?

4229
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:51,040
Protect that wisp.

4230
03:32:51,160 --> 03:32:51,620
No!

4231
03:32:55,580 --> 03:32:58,140
No future knowledge or sequence breaking needed.

4232
03:32:58,380 --> 03:32:59,180
What the...

4233
03:33:00,780 --> 03:33:01,720
Don't lie to me.

4234
03:33:03,940 --> 03:33:05,020
Don't lie to me.

4235
03:33:05,280 --> 03:33:06,380
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

4236
03:33:06,800 --> 03:33:08,400
Sorry, I have to pee a lot today.

4237
03:33:09,400 --> 03:33:10,720
Gonna get more tea though.

4238
03:33:10,720 --> 03:33:11,440
Yippee!

4239
03:36:24,500 --> 03:36:26,720
Guys, I'm doing a blue archive break.

4240
03:36:27,260 --> 03:36:28,420
A BA break.

4241
03:36:28,940 --> 03:36:29,840
Is she alive?

4242
03:36:30,080 --> 03:36:30,360
No!

4243
03:36:31,900 --> 03:36:33,260
No, I'm not alive.

4244
03:36:33,340 --> 03:36:34,040
I'm dead.

4245
03:36:34,260 --> 03:36:35,080
I'm a ghost.

4246
03:36:36,660 --> 03:36:37,600
A BA break.

4247
03:36:37,700 --> 03:36:38,300
A BA break.

4248
03:36:39,680 --> 03:36:40,440
I haven't...

4249
03:36:40,440 --> 03:36:40,760
I have...

4250
03:36:40,760 --> 03:36:41,800
I'm install...

4251
03:36:41,800 --> 03:36:44,020
I'm like downloading the new update right now.

4252
03:36:45,140 --> 03:36:47,100
Because I forgot to last night.

4253
03:36:47,560 --> 03:36:49,040
Time for camping hidey.

4254
03:36:49,120 --> 03:36:49,580
Exactly!

4255
03:36:49,580 --> 03:36:51,780
Let's pull for her right now.

4256
03:36:53,960 --> 03:36:54,320
Wait...

4257
03:36:54,760 --> 03:36:56,260
Wait, did the banner start already?

4258
03:36:56,740 --> 03:36:57,100
Actually.

4259
03:36:57,280 --> 03:36:57,980
BA fun.

4260
03:36:58,080 --> 03:36:58,760
Thank you!

4261
03:37:00,180 --> 03:37:01,180
Sensei got a sensei.

4262
03:37:01,180 --> 03:37:02,560
You know one of my favorite things to do?

4263
03:37:03,660 --> 03:37:06,100
Actually, one of the meetings last night that I had...

4264
03:37:08,440 --> 03:37:10,960
One of the people was a sensei.

4265
03:37:12,180 --> 03:37:12,940
And I was...

4266
03:37:12,940 --> 03:37:14,420
Because they had like a profile picture.

4267
03:37:14,560 --> 03:37:15,760
I was like, are you a sensei?

4268
03:37:15,900 --> 03:37:16,700
They were like, yeah!

4269
03:37:17,380 --> 03:37:18,580
And I was like, who's here?

4270
03:37:18,580 --> 03:37:20,320
This is one of my favorite things to do to senseis.

4271
03:37:20,820 --> 03:37:22,180
I'll be like, who's your favorite?

4272
03:37:22,340 --> 03:37:23,400
Who's your favorite character?

4273
03:37:23,780 --> 03:37:27,480
And they'll be like, oh, I really like so and so.

4274
03:37:27,980 --> 03:37:29,040
And I'll be like, wrong.

4275
03:37:29,760 --> 03:37:33,060
If you were a good sensei, all the girls would be your favorite.

4276
03:37:33,240 --> 03:37:34,520
You would treat them all equally.

4277
03:37:35,180 --> 03:37:36,360
And then they're like...

4278
03:37:36,360 --> 03:37:38,700
The other person...

4279
03:37:39,860 --> 03:37:43,380
The other person in the meeting was like, she told you.

4280
03:37:43,380 --> 03:37:43,560
True.

4281
03:37:45,940 --> 03:37:47,700
They were like, oh, damn!

4282
03:37:53,080 --> 03:37:53,440
Yeah.

4283
03:37:54,760 --> 03:37:56,120
If you were a good sensei...

4284
03:37:56,120 --> 03:37:57,440
Oh wait, the banner's not up yet.

4285
03:37:57,700 --> 03:37:58,300
Is it tomorrow?

4286
03:37:58,660 --> 03:37:59,500
Oh wait, yes it is.

4287
03:38:00,280 --> 03:38:00,920
Camping Haru!

4288
03:38:03,280 --> 03:38:05,360
I remember seeing the ads for this in Japan.

4289
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:06,540
Like the ads for her.

4290
03:38:06,760 --> 03:38:08,000
I didn't realize she was a...

4291
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:09,080
Oh, I thought she was a unique.

4292
03:38:09,980 --> 03:38:10,560
Oh, nice.

4293
03:38:12,540 --> 03:38:13,660
Maybe I should wait then.

4294
03:38:15,140 --> 03:38:15,980
I thought she was a unique.

4295
03:38:16,260 --> 03:38:17,940
Maybe I should just wait then.

4296
03:38:22,660 --> 03:38:23,620
Both permanent.

4297
03:38:25,440 --> 03:38:27,000
Maybe I'll just do like one.

4298
03:38:28,280 --> 03:38:29,240
Maybe I'll do one.

4299
03:38:29,440 --> 03:38:31,080
Good rolls be with you, Mito.

4300
03:38:34,220 --> 03:38:35,540
I'm waiting too.

4301
03:38:37,660 --> 03:38:39,200
But isn't she like really good?

4302
03:38:41,020 --> 03:38:42,320
So it's like good to get her now.

4303
03:38:47,220 --> 03:38:48,620
Just one temple.

4304
03:38:53,650 --> 03:38:54,950
One becomes two.

4305
03:38:55,050 --> 03:38:55,890
Two becomes four.

4306
03:38:56,110 --> 03:38:56,710
No, no, no.

4307
03:38:57,610 --> 03:38:59,650
Actually, yeah, that happened to me last...

4308
03:38:59,650 --> 03:38:59,690
Oh.

4309
03:39:00,670 --> 03:39:04,030
See, this is peak gacha polling music, right?

4310
03:39:07,250 --> 03:39:08,030
Hold on.

4311
03:39:08,450 --> 03:39:09,570
Blue archive break.

4312
03:39:09,710 --> 03:39:11,090
Everybody do your dailies.

4313
03:39:11,090 --> 03:39:11,910
If you play...

4314
03:39:11,910 --> 03:39:16,510
If you play any gacha games or whatever, do your dailies with me.

4315
03:39:17,170 --> 03:39:18,490
Let's do dailies together.

4316
03:39:18,490 --> 03:39:19,310
You know?

4317
03:39:22,290 --> 03:39:23,830
I forgot to do them earlier.

4318
03:39:24,230 --> 03:39:26,150
Well, I guess I was streaming.

4319
03:39:26,190 --> 03:39:28,250
I streamed right when it updated, so...

4320
03:39:28,250 --> 03:39:29,550
Or when the date changed.

4321
03:39:30,070 --> 03:39:30,930
But you know.

4322
03:39:31,310 --> 03:39:33,050
I don't wanna do dailies.

4323
03:39:34,230 --> 03:39:35,410
Do her dailies.

4324
03:39:36,230 --> 03:39:37,830
The girls are gonna be so sad.

4325
03:39:41,210 --> 03:39:42,690
I love this song so much.

4326
03:39:43,930 --> 03:39:45,630
I did Nikae dailies already?

4327
03:39:45,910 --> 03:39:46,870
Well, then...

4328
03:39:46,870 --> 03:39:47,950
Do something else.

4329
03:39:47,970 --> 03:39:48,470
But that is for now.

4330
03:39:51,230 --> 03:40:08,370
This is why I can only play, like, one gacha game at a time, because, you know, I invest so much into the one, that it's like, doing dailies for more than one gacha game seems tiring to me.

4331
03:40:14,190 --> 03:40:15,090
Very valid.

4332
03:40:15,090 --> 03:40:19,970
At least with Blue Archives, it takes, like, five minutes.

4333
03:40:20,090 --> 03:40:22,030
It's not even so much to do dailies.

4334
03:40:22,310 --> 03:40:23,890
I'm playing three and it's a lot.

4335
03:40:26,270 --> 03:40:27,150
You're crazy.

4336
03:40:27,430 --> 03:40:28,270
You're crazy!

4337
03:40:29,910 --> 03:40:31,590
Hmm... I'm doing my lessons.

4338
03:40:32,710 --> 03:40:34,250
Such a good sensei.

4339
03:40:35,150 --> 03:40:37,850
I'm teaching my girls good things.

4340
03:40:39,050 --> 03:40:40,590
I'm teaching them...

4341
03:40:41,950 --> 03:40:43,270
What do you think they learn?

4342
03:40:43,270 --> 03:40:45,490
What is sensei teaching them anyway?

4343
03:40:46,590 --> 03:40:47,870
Maybe don't answer that.

4344
03:40:48,710 --> 03:40:50,370
Do you assign homework, Mint?

4345
03:40:50,870 --> 03:40:51,990
It's optional.

4346
03:40:52,690 --> 03:40:54,030
It's optional homework.

4347
03:40:54,330 --> 03:40:55,230
I'm the cool teacher.

4348
03:40:57,010 --> 03:40:58,910
I'm THE cool teacher to them.

4349
03:41:05,970 --> 03:41:07,510
Can I get extra credit?

4350
03:41:08,810 --> 03:41:10,090
What a question.

4351
03:41:10,490 --> 03:41:12,370
I didn't think about it.

4352
03:41:17,150 --> 03:41:17,670
Stop!

4353
03:41:17,670 --> 03:41:17,670
Stop!

4354
03:41:17,670 --> 03:41:17,790
That's enough.

4355
03:41:19,190 --> 03:41:19,710
Stop!

4356
03:41:19,910 --> 03:41:21,170
Get your mind out of the gutter!

4357
03:41:22,450 --> 03:41:24,210
Get your mind out of the gutter!

4358
03:41:25,230 --> 03:41:31,930
I find... I almost have my Hot Springs Chetty Node 2 Level 20 relationship.

4359
03:41:32,530 --> 03:41:34,190
Not relationship... What's the word?

4360
03:41:35,170 --> 03:41:36,370
Oh, it is relationship.

4361
03:41:36,370 --> 03:41:36,750
Relationship.

4362
03:41:39,090 --> 03:41:41,290
Relationship doesn't have to mean romantic, though.

4363
03:41:42,110 --> 03:41:44,810
We're just... I'm her comrade.

4364
03:41:48,550 --> 03:41:50,150
I'm her comrade, you guys.

4365
03:41:52,870 --> 03:41:54,470
Don't be so weird about it.

4366
03:41:55,430 --> 03:41:55,950
Sure.

4367
03:41:58,730 --> 03:41:59,690
She's at 18.

4368
03:42:01,430 --> 03:42:02,450
Almost got her.

4369
03:42:02,610 --> 03:42:04,610
I like the hot springs one so much, though.

4370
03:42:04,630 --> 03:42:05,090
It's so cute.

4371
03:42:06,370 --> 03:42:07,510
With her little milk mustache.

4372
03:42:08,510 --> 03:42:09,530
She's so cute.

4373
03:42:11,150 --> 03:42:12,470
Chetty knows a cute brat?

4374
03:42:12,710 --> 03:42:12,930
Yeah.

4375
03:42:13,770 --> 03:42:14,250
She's...

4376
03:42:15,670 --> 03:42:16,910
She's definitely a brat.

4377
03:42:18,850 --> 03:42:20,930
I think that makes me love her more.

4378
03:42:21,250 --> 03:42:22,170
She's so dumb.

4379
03:42:22,530 --> 03:42:23,990
She's like, when's my nap time?

4380
03:42:24,270 --> 03:42:25,870
How dare you make me oversleep?

4381
03:42:27,550 --> 03:42:28,850
I love that about her.

4382
03:42:30,950 --> 03:42:32,470
Comrade is the new roommate.

4383
03:42:32,950 --> 03:42:34,170
What do you mean by that?

4384
03:42:38,250 --> 03:42:39,610
Oh my god, we're living together?

4385
03:42:40,310 --> 03:42:40,850
Ooh la la.

4386
03:42:43,830 --> 03:42:45,250
Blue archive in the streets.

4387
03:42:45,750 --> 03:42:46,750
Comrade in the sheets.

4388
03:42:46,950 --> 03:42:47,330
No!

4389
03:42:49,310 --> 03:42:51,370
My love for Chetty and I was so pure.

4390
03:42:52,690 --> 03:42:53,850
Can't say that about others.

4391
03:42:54,490 --> 03:42:55,230
I guess I can.

4392
03:42:55,450 --> 03:42:56,530
I'm a good sensei.

4393
03:42:56,930 --> 03:42:58,650
I'm a pure sensei, you guys.

4394
03:42:59,910 --> 03:43:01,730
Oh my god, they were roommates.

4395
03:43:06,410 --> 03:43:07,810
Get your minds out of the gutter.

4396
03:43:11,990 --> 03:43:12,870
Nice thumbnail.

4397
03:43:13,110 --> 03:43:13,610
Thank you.

4398
03:43:14,590 --> 03:43:15,710
Thank you very much.

4399
03:43:17,570 --> 03:43:20,450
I lost the tactical challenge, as always.

4400
03:43:21,670 --> 03:43:22,770
What else do I need to do?

4401
03:43:23,710 --> 03:43:25,210
I can save probably some of it.

4402
03:43:25,290 --> 03:43:26,610
Okay, I'm gonna do some polls, though.

4403
03:43:27,830 --> 03:43:30,370
Oh, they gave a lot of... a lot of...

4404
03:43:31,290 --> 03:43:31,730
Gemi's.

4405
03:43:31,890 --> 03:43:32,090
Nice.

4406
03:43:32,730 --> 03:43:33,170
Okay.

4407
03:43:35,790 --> 03:43:36,230
Okay.

4408
03:43:37,030 --> 03:43:37,710
I'm gonna...

4409
03:43:37,710 --> 03:43:37,790
I'm gonna...

4410
03:43:37,790 --> 03:43:41,250
I'm gonna do one poll... one ten poll for Hare.

4411
03:43:43,670 --> 03:43:44,950
Poll confirmed.

4412
03:43:49,070 --> 03:43:50,250
It's blue.

4413
03:43:50,550 --> 03:43:51,770
But maybe...

4414
03:43:52,450 --> 03:43:54,050
Maybe it'll change.

4415
03:43:55,530 --> 03:43:57,170
I'll draw a wisp on that.

4416
03:43:57,390 --> 03:43:57,850
Wait!

4417
03:43:58,070 --> 03:43:58,930
It changed!

4418
03:43:59,130 --> 03:43:59,370
It changed!

4419
03:43:59,450 --> 03:43:59,750
It changed!

4420
03:44:00,850 --> 03:44:01,590
Let's see.

4421
03:44:01,690 --> 03:44:01,970
Let's see.

4422
03:44:03,690 --> 03:44:04,350
Blue.

4423
03:44:04,350 --> 03:44:04,430
I got blue.

4424
03:44:05,080 --> 03:44:05,990
I got Judy.

4425
03:44:06,230 --> 03:44:06,950
And...

4426
03:44:08,490 --> 03:44:10,210
No way!

4427
03:44:13,650 --> 03:44:14,930
Oh shit!

4428
03:44:15,170 --> 03:44:16,290
I pulled Hare!

4429
03:44:16,490 --> 03:44:17,550
First try!

4430
03:44:18,170 --> 03:44:18,630
Wow!

4431
03:44:19,150 --> 03:44:21,010
Oh my god, streamer luck!

4432
03:44:21,210 --> 03:44:21,830
Streamer luck!

4433
03:44:23,030 --> 03:44:23,790
Yippee!

4434
03:44:25,130 --> 03:44:26,290
Yippee yippee!

4435
03:44:30,190 --> 03:44:32,810
I threw out a boyboy.

4436
03:44:32,890 --> 03:44:33,170
Cute.

4437
03:44:33,370 --> 03:44:34,130
Thank you.

4438
03:44:34,130 --> 03:44:34,790
Really cute.

4439
03:44:35,170 --> 03:44:35,350
Yeah.

4440
03:44:36,550 --> 03:44:37,030
Yippee!

4441
03:44:39,510 --> 03:44:40,250
Very nice.

4442
03:44:41,170 --> 03:44:43,670
Her thing is so cute she's eating the Yakiimo.

4443
03:44:43,970 --> 03:44:44,850
It's my favorite.

4444
03:44:46,930 --> 03:44:47,410
Mmm.

4445
03:44:48,210 --> 03:44:49,710
That was meant for me.

4446
03:44:49,750 --> 03:44:50,490
I'll take it back?

4447
03:44:50,790 --> 03:44:52,070
No take backsies.

4448
03:44:52,630 --> 03:44:53,610
You would give...

4449
03:44:53,610 --> 03:44:55,490
You would give me a gift and then ask for it back?

4450
03:44:56,850 --> 03:44:57,910
Have some shame.

4451
03:45:01,270 --> 03:45:03,810
Never got into Gachas because I refuse to get a new phone.

4452
03:45:04,130 --> 03:45:04,690
Oh, you know what?

4453
03:45:05,170 --> 03:45:06,550
You're saving a lot of money.

4454
03:45:09,050 --> 03:45:09,970
The Kotama...

4455
03:45:12,930 --> 03:45:14,730
Like... she looks so cute.

4456
03:45:16,170 --> 03:45:18,850
Everyone's so... I want everybody because they're all so Yuru Camp.

4457
03:45:20,510 --> 03:45:21,990
They're all so Yuru Camp.

4458
03:45:22,470 --> 03:45:23,230
So cute.

4459
03:45:24,270 --> 03:45:24,730
Okay.

4460
03:45:25,490 --> 03:45:27,090
I'll do the rest of everything later.

4461
03:45:27,250 --> 03:45:28,330
Oh, I am starting to get hungry.

4462
03:45:28,750 --> 03:45:30,770
I should probably think of what I'm gonna have for dinner.

4463
03:45:32,190 --> 03:45:33,410
Okay, let's meditate.

4464
03:45:37,750 --> 03:45:40,270
Beer is actually pretty good for a gacha when it comes to currency.

4465
03:45:42,410 --> 03:45:42,850
Sometimes.

4466
03:45:44,730 --> 03:45:45,170
Sometimes.

4467
03:45:46,590 --> 03:45:48,390
Now it's time to try gacha luck on...

4468
03:45:48,950 --> 03:45:49,390
Wuwa.

4469
03:45:49,850 --> 03:45:50,990
What is Wuwa?

4470
03:45:51,170 --> 03:45:51,690
Oh no.

4471
03:45:52,250 --> 03:45:54,670
What is... If it's Yuhyun, then don't trust it.

4472
03:45:55,450 --> 03:45:56,550
What do you mean by that?

4473
03:45:59,270 --> 03:46:01,870
Look, it's like... It's just the campfire the whole time.

4474
03:46:06,400 --> 03:46:07,240
Weathering waves.

4475
03:46:10,240 --> 03:46:11,740
Oh, it's Genshin 2?

4476
03:46:11,960 --> 03:46:13,360
I've never heard of it before actually.

4477
03:46:14,140 --> 03:46:14,660
What?

4478
03:46:14,700 --> 03:46:15,640
I've never even heard of it.

4479
03:46:17,700 --> 03:46:19,660
Hot new gacha game I won't play.

4480
03:46:22,900 --> 03:46:24,360
Oh, never... Oh, it's new.

4481
03:46:25,960 --> 03:46:27,020
Genshin but harder.

4482
03:46:27,320 --> 03:46:28,520
Oh, interesting.

4483
03:46:30,980 --> 03:46:31,500
Beep.

4484
03:46:31,500 --> 03:46:32,020
Beep.

4485
03:46:32,940 --> 03:46:33,460
Beep.

4486
03:46:34,380 --> 03:46:34,900
Beep.

4487
03:46:35,400 --> 03:46:35,880
Okay.

4488
03:46:37,300 --> 03:46:37,960
Let's see.

4489
03:46:39,100 --> 03:46:41,480
Guys, I'm not looking forward to this at all.

4490
03:46:41,600 --> 03:46:43,380
I'm not looking forward to this at all.

4491
03:46:45,120 --> 03:46:52,520
A room full of burned slide rails piled up on a hidden slide rail that shows a container marked with a glowing symbol being handed to a shadowy figure.

4492
03:46:53,060 --> 03:47:03,720
The figure follows a procession of green lights through a forest to a candlelit building where they carry the container into a passage behind a roaring fireplace.

4493
03:47:05,300 --> 03:47:06,580
Oh, okay, that's that one.

4494
03:47:06,680 --> 03:47:07,140
Just kidding.

4495
03:47:07,300 --> 03:47:08,120
I was like, wait a second.

4496
03:47:08,280 --> 03:47:09,200
This isn't the one.

4497
03:47:11,260 --> 03:47:14,020
Made by the same company from Punishing Green Raven.

4498
03:47:14,140 --> 03:47:15,080
Oh, okay.

4499
03:47:17,740 --> 03:47:19,300
Oh, oh, oh, there we go.

4500
03:47:22,860 --> 03:47:23,600
No, no, no.

4501
03:47:26,540 --> 03:47:26,900
Um...

4502
03:47:28,740 --> 03:47:29,460
This is...

4503
03:47:30,580 --> 03:47:31,840
the one we're doing.

4504
03:47:34,040 --> 03:47:34,400
Right?

4505
03:47:34,580 --> 03:47:34,820
Oh!

4506
03:47:35,020 --> 03:47:36,400
No, this is the one we just did.

4507
03:47:36,400 --> 03:47:37,760
What the heck?

4508
03:47:42,420 --> 03:47:47,140
Wait, I can put mark locations on these too?

4509
03:47:52,380 --> 03:47:52,900
Okay...

4510
03:47:54,280 --> 03:47:56,220
I'm just getting rid of these real quick.

4511
03:47:59,380 --> 03:48:00,920
Wait a second though, aren't...

4512
03:48:01,940 --> 03:48:02,460
Oh!

4513
03:48:02,820 --> 03:48:04,340
They're the same because they're connected.

4514
03:48:04,660 --> 03:48:05,140
I'm so...

4515
03:48:05,140 --> 03:48:06,540
I get it.

4516
03:48:09,060 --> 03:48:10,000
Secret well.

4517
03:48:10,760 --> 03:48:11,280
Secret well.

4518
03:48:11,420 --> 03:48:12,020
We're doing this one.

4519
03:48:12,160 --> 03:48:13,120
The secret mural.

4520
03:48:20,480 --> 03:48:22,100
I don't want to do...

4521
03:48:22,920 --> 03:48:24,960
I'm scared, you guys!

4522
03:48:25,400 --> 03:48:27,600
Can I turn on the baby mode now?

4523
03:48:28,900 --> 03:48:32,220
Can I turn on baby mode now, please?

4524
03:48:36,720 --> 03:48:37,440
No.

4525
03:48:38,300 --> 03:48:39,020
No.

4526
03:48:39,020 --> 03:48:39,960
I can't do this alone...

4527
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:44,740
You'll be fine.

4528
03:48:58,220 --> 03:49:00,960
Is that why it was a spoiler?

4529
03:49:04,960 --> 03:49:05,680
Whoa, whoa.

4530
03:49:05,780 --> 03:49:06,340
Coming in hot.

4531
03:49:06,360 --> 03:49:06,900
Coming in hot!

4532
03:49:07,220 --> 03:49:09,340
Is that why it was a spoiler... because...

4533
03:49:11,560 --> 03:49:12,080
Yep.

4534
03:49:16,340 --> 03:49:17,580
Do it in one run.

4535
03:49:17,740 --> 03:49:18,080
Okay.

4536
03:49:24,520 --> 03:49:26,120
I'll try at least one run.

4537
03:49:29,280 --> 03:49:32,580
Probably should have gone the other... Well, I'm going to grab the...

4538
03:49:34,280 --> 03:49:35,740
The artifact here.

4539
03:49:36,020 --> 03:49:36,840
I like getting it here.

4540
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:37,600
It's really easy.

4541
03:49:41,430 --> 03:49:42,950
I'll fail in one run.

4542
03:49:44,230 --> 03:49:45,410
Guys, I'm not good at stealth.

4543
03:49:47,250 --> 03:49:47,650
I'm scared.

4544
03:49:47,730 --> 03:49:48,710
I'm scaredy baby.

4545
03:49:51,970 --> 03:49:53,290
I'm so scaredy baby.

4546
03:49:53,530 --> 03:49:54,210
I'm scaredy baby.

4547
03:50:09,410 --> 03:50:10,810
Take it down.

4548
03:50:11,690 --> 03:50:13,050
Going around town.

4549
03:50:15,570 --> 03:50:18,290
Careful not to imply what she's about to experience.

4550
03:50:18,430 --> 03:50:18,770
Okay.

4551
03:50:19,290 --> 03:50:21,290
I'm not going to look at chat too much.

4552
03:50:22,950 --> 03:50:23,630
I'm sorry.

4553
03:50:23,810 --> 03:50:25,530
I'm just being a little baby.

4554
03:50:25,850 --> 03:50:26,290
Okay.

4555
03:50:27,670 --> 03:50:29,070
I'm just being a little baby.

4556
03:50:29,190 --> 03:50:30,130
I'm just being a little baby.

4557
03:50:34,330 --> 03:50:35,110
Here we go.

4558
03:50:39,850 --> 03:50:40,730
We're going.

4559
03:50:41,030 --> 03:50:42,990
We're going to go in like two seconds.

4560
03:50:43,570 --> 03:50:45,130
Here we go.

4561
03:50:47,650 --> 03:50:48,170
We're going.

4562
03:51:00,490 --> 03:51:00,890
We're going.

4563
03:51:01,770 --> 03:51:02,210
We're going.

4564
03:51:02,670 --> 03:51:03,070
We're going.

4565
03:51:03,330 --> 03:51:03,730
We're going.

4566
03:51:03,910 --> 03:51:04,610
We're going.

4567
03:51:04,770 --> 03:51:05,170
We're going.

4568
03:51:05,290 --> 03:51:05,690
We're going.

4569
03:51:05,770 --> 03:51:05,770
We're going.

4570
03:51:05,770 --> 03:51:05,890
We're going.

4571
03:51:05,890 --> 03:51:05,930
We're going.

4572
03:51:05,930 --> 03:51:05,930
We're going.

4573
03:51:05,930 --> 03:51:06,330
We're going.

4574
03:51:06,350 --> 03:51:07,010
We're going.

4575
03:51:07,010 --> 03:51:07,010
We're going.

4576
03:51:07,010 --> 03:51:07,070
We're going.

4577
03:51:07,070 --> 03:51:07,070
We're going.

4578
03:51:07,070 --> 03:51:07,070
We're going.

4579
03:51:07,070 --> 03:51:07,250
We're going.

4580
03:51:07,250 --> 03:51:07,370
We're going.

4581
03:51:07,370 --> 03:51:07,370
We're going.

4582
03:51:07,370 --> 03:51:07,370
We're going.

4583
03:51:07,370 --> 03:51:07,690
We're going.

4584
03:51:07,690 --> 03:51:07,810
We're going.

4585
03:51:07,810 --> 03:51:07,810
We're going.

4586
03:51:07,810 --> 03:51:07,930
We're going.

4587
03:51:09,390 --> 03:51:10,530
We're going.

4588
03:51:18,720 --> 03:51:20,620
I keep forgetting this is not a VOD.

4589
03:51:20,780 --> 03:51:21,640
Thanks for joining.

4590
03:51:22,680 --> 03:51:24,220
It's not a VOD, not yet.

4591
03:51:25,280 --> 03:51:26,820
I could stop the stream if you want.

4592
03:51:27,000 --> 03:51:28,140
I'll play it off that.

4593
03:51:28,240 --> 03:51:29,520
I'll play it off the stream.

4594
03:51:29,980 --> 03:51:30,960
I'll finish it.

4595
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:31,820
Wow, thank you.

4596
03:51:33,100 --> 03:51:36,740
I'll finish it off the stream so that then it will feel like a VOD.

4597
03:51:46,400 --> 03:51:48,340
It is this one, right?

4598
03:51:48,480 --> 03:51:49,580
Yeah, it is this one.

4599
03:51:57,630 --> 03:51:59,270
She actually hates us.

4600
03:51:59,950 --> 03:52:02,070
Stop being so dramatic.

4601
03:52:03,750 --> 03:52:06,710
Stop being so dramatic.

4602
03:52:13,280 --> 03:52:14,660
This has all been pre-recorded.

4603
03:52:14,680 --> 03:52:15,340
Pre-recorded the whole time.

4604
03:52:16,040 --> 03:52:16,940
Pretty much.

4605
03:52:30,090 --> 03:52:30,690
Let's go.

4606
03:52:33,430 --> 03:52:35,570
I'm going over there.

4607
03:52:36,210 --> 03:52:37,990
I'm going there.

4608
03:52:38,630 --> 03:52:40,250
I'll see you later tonight.

4609
03:52:44,450 --> 03:52:45,610
Is it too bright?

4610
03:52:46,150 --> 03:52:46,750
Nope.

4611
03:52:56,120 --> 03:52:57,000
Okay, hold on.

4612
03:52:58,920 --> 03:53:00,500
Okay, order of operations.

4613
03:53:02,560 --> 03:53:03,000
Okay.

4614
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:03,440
Order of operations.

4615
03:53:04,480 --> 03:53:07,220
We go there, go to the show.

4616
03:53:08,080 --> 03:53:08,800
Go to the...

4617
03:53:08,800 --> 03:53:11,260
Go to the where the little recital is, or the stage.

4618
03:53:11,780 --> 03:53:13,400
We walk across the river.

4619
03:53:13,520 --> 03:53:14,620
Blow out the lights.

4620
03:53:14,800 --> 03:53:15,720
Go back inside.

4621
03:53:17,100 --> 03:53:19,380
Turn on the lights for the bridge.

4622
03:53:19,480 --> 03:53:20,360
Walk across the bridge.

4623
03:53:20,520 --> 03:53:21,160
Go to the basement.

4624
03:53:26,500 --> 03:53:26,940
Okay.

4625
03:53:28,040 --> 03:53:28,700
I'm scared.

4626
03:53:29,220 --> 03:53:30,260
I don't want to do this.

4627
03:53:31,660 --> 03:53:32,280
I'm scared.

4628
03:53:32,280 --> 03:53:32,280
I'm so scared.

4629
03:53:32,960 --> 03:53:34,400
The shortcut I found.

4630
03:53:35,360 --> 03:53:36,180
What shortcut?

4631
03:53:37,060 --> 03:53:38,060
I found a shortcut?

4632
03:53:44,340 --> 03:53:44,820
Wait!

4633
03:53:44,820 --> 03:53:47,320
Wait, if I go across the river... wait a second.

4634
03:53:47,500 --> 03:53:48,440
If I go... yeah, wait.

4635
03:53:48,600 --> 03:53:50,780
If I go across the river...

4636
03:53:54,640 --> 03:53:59,080
And I... where is that part... where is that spot though?

4637
03:54:19,580 --> 03:54:20,980
Yeah, where we pop out.

4638
03:54:21,340 --> 03:54:23,280
I wonder if that will work then.

4639
03:54:24,900 --> 03:54:25,360
Right.

4640
03:54:28,060 --> 03:54:28,920
Over here.

4641
03:54:30,000 --> 03:54:30,460
Right?

4642
03:54:30,500 --> 03:54:31,820
And then we just come back and...

4643
03:54:34,680 --> 03:54:35,140
Wait.

4644
03:54:35,140 --> 03:54:35,600
No.

4645
03:54:36,020 --> 03:54:36,480
Wait.

4646
03:54:36,660 --> 03:54:37,840
No, that doesn't work.

4647
03:54:38,060 --> 03:54:38,380
Wait.

4648
03:54:40,160 --> 03:54:41,860
You can see it from the bridge.

4649
03:54:46,780 --> 03:54:47,700
That... but...

4650
03:54:52,150 --> 03:54:53,710
No, that's just what we have to...

4651
03:54:57,410 --> 03:54:58,450
I'm confused.

4652
03:55:02,190 --> 03:55:04,090
What's the ghost cooking?

4653
03:55:04,390 --> 03:55:04,950
Nothing.

4654
03:55:05,290 --> 03:55:06,350
My brain is fried.

4655
03:55:06,430 --> 03:55:07,030
I'm too scared.

4656
03:55:08,370 --> 03:55:09,530
I'm too nervous.

4657
03:55:10,890 --> 03:55:13,510
The power just went out?

4658
03:55:15,770 --> 03:55:17,010
Power just went out.

4659
03:55:19,250 --> 03:55:20,850
No time for music!

4660
03:55:21,050 --> 03:55:22,030
No time for music!

4661
03:55:27,060 --> 03:55:28,340
Oh god.

4662
03:55:28,460 --> 03:55:29,400
Oh golly.

4663
03:55:29,400 --> 03:55:29,820
Oh god.

4664
03:55:46,640 --> 03:55:48,640
My... my shoes!

4665
03:56:29,680 --> 03:56:31,000
Will he be...

4666
03:56:36,800 --> 03:56:38,340
Will he have a light?

4667
03:56:39,000 --> 03:56:41,040
This room...

4668
03:56:42,700 --> 03:56:43,360
Oh my god.

4669
03:56:43,380 --> 03:56:44,340
It's just a place to hide.

4670
03:56:46,840 --> 03:56:47,780
I hate this!

4671
03:56:47,880 --> 03:56:48,500
I hate this!

4672
03:56:48,540 --> 03:56:49,160
I hate this!

4673
03:56:49,220 --> 03:56:50,300
It's just a place to hide!

4674
03:56:51,260 --> 03:56:53,600
No wonder I didn't want this...

4675
03:57:04,250 --> 03:57:06,250
He's not gonna have... He's gonna have a light though, right?

4676
03:57:13,500 --> 03:57:14,820
He's gonna have a light though, right?

4677
03:57:15,440 --> 03:57:15,940
Oh god.

4678
03:57:16,040 --> 03:57:16,340
Oh god.

4679
03:57:16,360 --> 03:57:16,600
Oh god.

4680
03:57:18,700 --> 03:57:19,760
Is he gonna have a light?

4681
03:57:26,000 --> 03:57:27,220
They all have the same artifact.

4682
03:57:27,460 --> 03:57:27,880
Yeah, right?

4683
03:57:28,340 --> 03:57:29,120
Thank you!

4684
03:57:37,050 --> 03:57:37,690
I'm lost.

4685
03:57:48,690 --> 03:57:49,650
Oh my

4686
03:57:53,220 --> 03:57:58,640
god.

4687
03:58:16,080 --> 03:58:16,980
They don't have a light.

4688
03:58:17,260 --> 03:58:18,340
They don't have a light.

4689
03:58:26,340 --> 03:58:28,600
Why can't I just jump down there?

4690
03:58:31,720 --> 03:58:32,540
Actually...

4691
03:58:34,340 --> 03:58:35,160
No.

4692
03:58:35,340 --> 03:58:35,880
Wait.

4693
03:58:37,220 --> 03:58:39,180
If I were to leave...

4694
03:58:41,540 --> 03:58:44,280
Technically speaking, if I were to leave...

4695
03:58:44,280 --> 03:58:46,500
And take the boat...

4696
03:58:46,500 --> 03:58:48,380
And come back here...

4697
03:58:48,380 --> 03:58:49,640
And...

4698
03:58:50,740 --> 03:58:51,560
Um...

4699
03:58:53,420 --> 03:58:54,180
How that...

4700
03:58:54,180 --> 03:58:54,480
Oh wait.

4701
03:58:54,520 --> 03:58:54,660
No.

4702
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:56,240
I would need the ladder.

4703
03:58:56,360 --> 03:58:57,280
Or I would need the elevator.

4704
03:58:57,760 --> 03:58:58,300
Dang it.

4705
03:58:58,680 --> 03:58:59,060
Nevermind.

4706
03:59:02,300 --> 03:59:02,900
Dang it.

4707
03:59:02,960 --> 03:59:03,800
I would need the elevator.

4708
03:59:05,160 --> 03:59:06,780
I was gonna say, what if I just left...

4709
03:59:06,780 --> 03:59:07,560
And then...

4710
03:59:08,140 --> 03:59:08,900
Came back...

4711
03:59:08,900 --> 03:59:10,100
And then took the boat...

4712
03:59:10,100 --> 03:59:11,540
And then avoided everybody inside.

4713
03:59:12,080 --> 03:59:12,440
But...

4714
03:59:12,440 --> 03:59:14,440
Cause then I would use the little...

4715
03:59:14,440 --> 03:59:16,620
Boat area and go through the back way.

4716
03:59:16,940 --> 03:59:17,320
But...

4717
03:59:17,720 --> 03:59:18,740
You can lower it first.

4718
03:59:18,880 --> 03:59:19,760
But I have to...

4719
03:59:20,400 --> 03:59:21,140
You have to...

4720
03:59:21,140 --> 03:59:22,540
Get on that side to lower it.

4721
03:59:26,550 --> 03:59:27,950
That was some good cooking.

4722
03:59:28,110 --> 03:59:28,570
Thanks.

4723
03:59:30,630 --> 03:59:31,530
I mean...

4724
03:59:34,590 --> 03:59:35,070
Unless...

4725
03:59:39,740 --> 03:59:40,400
Hold on.

4726
03:59:46,320 --> 03:59:47,460
What if I...

4727
03:59:48,260 --> 03:59:50,580
Lower it before I...

4728
03:59:51,900 --> 03:59:53,580
Before I blow out the lights.

4729
03:59:54,760 --> 03:59:55,480
Hold on.

4730
03:59:58,220 --> 03:59:59,240
Cause then I could...

4731
03:59:59,660 --> 04:00:00,120
Hold on.

4732
04:00:04,320 --> 04:00:05,600
Then I could avoid everything.

4733
04:00:12,490 --> 04:00:13,550
I'm just stalling.

4734
04:00:13,550 --> 04:00:13,730
No.

4735
04:00:13,790 --> 04:00:13,970
No.

4736
04:00:14,050 --> 04:00:14,250
No.

4737
04:00:14,270 --> 04:00:15,030
I'm actually cooking.

4738
04:00:15,930 --> 04:00:16,490
I think.

4739
04:00:18,770 --> 04:00:19,910
Should I try it?

4740
04:00:20,070 --> 04:00:21,090
But I would have to...

4741
04:00:22,470 --> 04:00:23,030
Hold on.

4742
04:00:23,050 --> 04:00:24,190
If I go back inside...

4743
04:00:24,190 --> 04:00:24,890
I'm scared.

4744
04:00:24,970 --> 04:00:25,950
I don't wanna get caught again.

4745
04:00:26,370 --> 04:00:27,810
I don't wanna get caught again.

4746
04:00:32,360 --> 04:00:33,080
Worth a shot?

4747
04:00:33,980 --> 04:00:34,380
Okay.

4748
04:00:35,520 --> 04:00:36,440
I'm really scared.

4749
04:00:36,560 --> 04:00:37,420
So I think I'm gonna...

4750
04:00:40,000 --> 04:00:41,240
Think I'm gonna try it.

4751
04:00:44,260 --> 04:00:44,620
Wait.

4752
04:00:45,180 --> 04:00:46,000
What if I just...

4753
04:00:46,440 --> 04:00:47,100
Who knows?

4754
04:00:47,120 --> 04:00:48,220
Maybe I won't break my legs.

4755
04:00:51,600 --> 04:00:52,900
I'm just an alien boy.

4756
04:00:54,160 --> 04:00:55,880
Or actually I don't know what my gender is.

4757
04:00:55,980 --> 04:00:56,660
I'm just an alien!

4758
04:00:59,980 --> 04:01:00,340
Okay.

4759
04:01:01,360 --> 04:01:03,140
I think I would have to meditate though, right?

4760
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:04,740
I think I'd have to meditate.

4761
04:01:05,000 --> 04:01:07,300
I wonder if there's a way to do it the other ones too then.

4762
04:01:07,520 --> 04:01:08,000
Hold on.

4763
04:01:10,180 --> 04:01:11,240
What were they?

4764
04:01:12,460 --> 04:01:13,660
I'm just a little guy!

4765
04:01:14,040 --> 04:01:15,140
Yeah, I'm just a little guy.

4766
04:01:16,740 --> 04:01:17,140
Then...

4767
04:01:19,960 --> 04:01:20,760
Hold on.

4768
04:01:22,020 --> 04:01:23,240
So that was that one.

4769
04:01:23,780 --> 04:01:24,620
There's the one...

4770
04:01:24,620 --> 04:01:25,880
We still don't know how to get down.

4771
04:01:30,770 --> 04:01:31,170
Sorry.

4772
04:01:31,290 --> 04:01:32,570
I know it was probably a waste of time.

4773
04:01:32,650 --> 04:01:33,710
But I just came up with this idea.

4774
04:01:39,260 --> 04:01:40,300
Heartians are genderless.

4775
04:01:40,480 --> 04:01:40,700
Okay.

4776
04:01:42,200 --> 04:01:43,120
I'm just a little...

4777
04:01:43,860 --> 04:01:44,380
creature.

4778
04:01:45,980 --> 04:01:47,160
I'm just a creature.

4779
04:01:50,040 --> 04:01:50,560
Okay.

4780
04:01:54,550 --> 04:01:56,630
That was a bit of a waste of a loop.

4781
04:02:00,250 --> 04:02:00,770
But...

4782
04:02:02,170 --> 04:02:02,690
Okay.

4783
04:02:06,490 --> 04:02:07,510
If we...

4784
04:02:08,810 --> 04:02:09,850
I'm trying to remember.

4785
04:02:10,050 --> 04:02:11,050
I think it's the...

4786
04:02:12,530 --> 04:02:14,910
I think it's the first area...

4787
04:02:14,910 --> 04:02:15,430
I think it's the first area...

4788
04:02:15,430 --> 04:02:16,290
I gave her a super chat by the way.

4789
04:02:16,310 --> 04:02:16,630
Hold on.

4790
04:02:16,770 --> 04:02:19,630
I think it's the first area that has...

4791
04:02:25,270 --> 04:02:26,470
Not the hidden gorge.

4792
04:02:29,530 --> 04:02:30,630
I think it's he...

4793
04:02:31,810 --> 04:02:32,170
Here.

4794
04:02:32,970 --> 04:02:34,430
That you can access the boat.

4795
04:02:37,530 --> 04:02:39,290
I think it's here that you access the boat.

4796
04:02:39,450 --> 04:02:39,730
Okay.

4797
04:02:39,810 --> 04:02:40,270
All right.

4798
04:02:40,350 --> 04:02:42,130
We're going to speed, speed, speed.

4799
04:02:42,790 --> 04:02:43,870
If I can find the seat.

4800
04:02:43,910 --> 04:02:44,030
Okay.

4801
04:02:45,250 --> 04:02:46,530
We can find the seat.

4802
04:02:46,690 --> 04:02:46,870
Okay.

4803
04:02:46,910 --> 04:02:47,330
Here we go.

4804
04:02:47,410 --> 04:02:47,670
Here we go.

4805
04:02:47,850 --> 04:02:48,330
Okay.

4806
04:02:48,530 --> 04:02:49,990
My mind is...

4807
04:02:49,990 --> 04:02:51,030
All right.

4808
04:02:54,430 --> 04:02:55,890
That was so close.

4809
04:02:56,910 --> 04:02:58,450
My mind is clear.

4810
04:02:59,570 --> 04:03:00,290
Not really.

4811
04:03:02,310 --> 04:03:03,390
Gender scaredy cat.

4812
04:03:04,190 --> 04:03:04,670
Stop.

4813
04:03:12,070 --> 04:03:14,010
For the other two though, I'm still not sure.

4814
04:03:14,030 --> 04:03:18,550
I'm going to have to even look up what to do again for them because I don't quite remember.

4815
04:03:19,390 --> 04:03:19,790
Okay.

4816
04:03:20,870 --> 04:03:21,470
All right.

4817
04:03:27,150 --> 04:03:27,550
Inside.

4818
04:03:28,310 --> 04:03:28,710
Oh.

4819
04:03:30,910 --> 04:03:31,550
Oh, good.

4820
04:03:32,670 --> 04:03:33,490
Can I exit?

4821
04:03:34,650 --> 04:03:35,450
Then we're fine.

4822
04:03:35,690 --> 04:03:36,090
Okay.

4823
04:03:36,130 --> 04:03:36,430
Here we go.

4824
04:03:39,010 --> 04:03:39,410
Now...

4825
04:03:40,310 --> 04:03:40,710
No.

4826
04:03:40,730 --> 04:03:41,810
I'm just going to go the normal way.

4827
04:03:50,990 --> 04:03:52,570
Just going the way that I've been going.

4828
04:03:52,970 --> 04:03:53,370
Okay.

4829
04:03:54,310 --> 04:04:02,150
It's okay because first we're going to grab artifact.

4830
04:04:02,690 --> 04:04:08,990
Then we go in, we lower, we go in, we lower.

4831
04:04:09,690 --> 04:04:10,330
The...

4832
04:04:11,970 --> 04:04:14,110
Why do I want to say umbrella?

4833
04:04:14,470 --> 04:04:15,110
Elevator?

4834
04:04:16,710 --> 04:04:17,350
Hello.

4835
04:04:17,530 --> 04:04:18,010
Hello.

4836
04:04:18,330 --> 04:04:18,630
Hello.

4837
04:04:18,850 --> 04:04:19,290
Hey.

4838
04:04:19,650 --> 04:04:20,230
Hey.

4839
04:04:20,530 --> 04:04:20,970
Hey.

4840
04:04:21,130 --> 04:04:21,210
Hey.

4841
04:04:21,610 --> 04:04:23,290
Under my umbrella.

4842
04:04:23,390 --> 04:04:37,830
Then we leave, come back here, go back in with the artifact, you, and then we ride to that area, use the elevator, go up, avoid all spookies.

4843
04:04:38,450 --> 04:04:39,090
Right?

4844
04:04:41,630 --> 04:04:43,070
The umbrella-vator.

4845
04:04:44,870 --> 04:04:49,170
Elevator, vator, vator, ay, ay, ay.

4846
04:04:52,490 --> 04:04:53,350
Oh, yeah.

4847
04:04:54,510 --> 04:04:55,650
Is this a tutorial?

4848
04:04:55,950 --> 04:04:56,530
I sure wish.

4849
04:04:56,690 --> 04:04:58,710
Oh, oh, no, no, no, we need you.

4850
04:04:59,470 --> 04:05:00,290
Alright, let's go.

4851
04:05:05,110 --> 04:05:08,090
It might be a really tight timing, but...

4852
04:05:09,530 --> 04:05:13,170
By golly, by George, I hope we can do it.

4853
04:05:14,410 --> 04:05:18,150
And then we'll figure out another way to avoid...

4854
04:05:22,350 --> 04:05:23,290
the rest.

4855
04:05:35,370 --> 04:05:37,170
Full speed ahead!

4856
04:05:40,550 --> 04:05:43,110
She's had brain cells spooked into her.

4857
04:05:48,730 --> 04:05:51,970
As long as the dam doesn't break, broken, yeah, exactly.

4858
04:05:55,300 --> 04:05:56,560
Come on, come on!

4859
04:05:56,720 --> 04:05:57,900
We need to go faster!

4860
04:05:58,440 --> 04:05:59,040
Faster!

4861
04:06:01,160 --> 04:06:01,920
Full speed!

4862
04:06:02,220 --> 04:06:03,060
Full speed!

4863
04:06:03,320 --> 04:06:04,120
Full speed!

4864
04:06:05,540 --> 04:06:06,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

4865
04:06:07,060 --> 04:06:07,680
Wait, wait, wait.

4866
04:06:07,760 --> 04:06:08,340
Wait, wait, wait.

4867
04:06:08,600 --> 04:06:09,180
Wait, wait, wait.

4868
04:06:09,360 --> 04:06:10,440
This way, this way, this way.

4869
04:06:10,540 --> 04:06:11,020
This way.

4870
04:06:16,100 --> 04:06:16,480
Okay.

4871
04:06:19,020 --> 04:06:22,140
And the reason I also wanted to take the boat is because...

4872
04:06:22,690 --> 04:06:25,220
now we have an easy access boat for when we...

4873
04:06:26,580 --> 04:06:27,340
come back...

4874
04:06:27,340 --> 04:06:29,220
that we can just drop down...

4875
04:06:30,660 --> 04:06:31,420
and continue...

4876
04:06:32,540 --> 04:06:32,940
onwards.

4877
04:06:33,440 --> 04:06:34,260
Run, run, run.

4878
04:06:39,560 --> 04:06:40,600
Come on, come on!

4879
04:06:40,740 --> 04:06:41,720
Come down, come down!

4880
04:06:44,640 --> 04:06:45,680
Come down, come down!

4881
04:06:45,820 --> 04:06:46,720
Go up, go up!

4882
04:06:50,600 --> 04:06:53,420
At this part of the DLC where time really starts to matter.

4883
04:06:53,540 --> 04:06:54,120
Yeah, right!

4884
04:07:01,110 --> 04:07:02,030
Which one is it?

4885
04:07:03,430 --> 04:07:03,830
It's...

4886
04:07:03,830 --> 04:07:04,250
you!

4887
04:07:05,290 --> 04:07:06,110
I knew that.

4888
04:07:07,710 --> 04:07:08,090
Okay.

4889
04:07:13,720 --> 04:07:14,940
Go, go, go!

4890
04:07:15,200 --> 04:07:16,480
Go, avoid the spooky!

4891
04:07:16,880 --> 04:07:17,960
Go, go, go!

4892
04:07:18,220 --> 04:07:19,460
Go, avoid the spooky!

4893
04:07:20,460 --> 04:07:20,940
Sleep!

4894
04:07:25,080 --> 04:07:25,760
Wake up!

4895
04:07:26,140 --> 04:07:27,240
No time for sleep!

4896
04:07:27,400 --> 04:07:28,260
What's wrong with you?

4897
04:07:28,440 --> 04:07:29,800
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

4898
04:07:30,100 --> 04:07:31,240
Run, run, run!

4899
04:07:33,460 --> 04:07:34,860
No time to be scared!

4900
04:07:35,860 --> 04:07:38,060
Only scared if we don't make it!

4901
04:07:38,200 --> 04:07:40,160
Only be scared if this fails us!

4902
04:07:40,600 --> 04:07:41,080
Okay.

4903
04:07:43,480 --> 04:07:45,680
No time to be scared right now!

4904
04:07:49,740 --> 04:07:50,400
Okay.

4905
04:07:52,840 --> 04:07:54,500
No time for caution!

4906
04:07:55,540 --> 04:07:56,400
His shoes!

4907
04:07:56,900 --> 04:07:57,400
His shoes!

4908
04:08:00,800 --> 04:08:02,420
There wasn't there another room?

4909
04:08:02,620 --> 04:08:02,880
In the...

4910
04:08:02,880 --> 04:08:04,560
Actually, with the tree...

4911
04:08:04,560 --> 04:08:06,680
There was another room in there that...

4912
04:08:11,930 --> 04:08:12,590
That...

4913
04:08:15,090 --> 04:08:15,750
We...

4914
04:08:15,750 --> 04:08:16,250
We...

4915
04:08:16,250 --> 04:08:16,570
We...

4916
04:08:16,570 --> 04:08:16,790
We...

4917
04:08:16,790 --> 04:08:17,910
You couldn't go in just yet.

4918
04:08:20,230 --> 04:08:20,710
Okay.

4919
04:08:23,850 --> 04:08:24,430
Your shoes!

4920
04:08:24,850 --> 04:08:25,290
Your shoes!

4921
04:08:25,490 --> 04:08:26,670
Just keep watching them!

4922
04:08:26,850 --> 04:08:27,770
Don't worry about me!

4923
04:08:28,790 --> 04:08:29,270
Okay.

4924
04:08:29,370 --> 04:08:29,890
Go up.

4925
04:08:30,230 --> 04:08:38,170
It is really rude though that it does extinguish the fire... or the... yeah, the bridge over here.

4926
04:08:38,710 --> 04:08:39,630
I'll be honest.

4927
04:08:41,110 --> 04:08:42,090
It's pretty rude.

4928
04:08:42,250 --> 04:08:43,530
Look at all these hiding spots!

4929
04:08:45,150 --> 04:08:46,770
This guy is gonna be crying.

4930
04:08:46,770 --> 04:08:48,730
Crawling around here, it'd be so scary.

4931
04:08:50,190 --> 04:08:51,630
It'd be so terrifying.

4932
04:08:53,250 --> 04:08:54,630
Now we go back.

4933
04:09:10,490 --> 04:09:11,690
Time to lower.

4934
04:09:11,950 --> 04:09:13,670
And then we're just gonna jump into the water.

4935
04:09:18,390 --> 04:09:19,690
Is there something here?

4936
04:09:19,810 --> 04:09:20,030
Oh no.

4937
04:09:21,470 --> 04:09:22,970
Don't jump into the water yet.

4938
04:09:23,930 --> 04:09:25,170
No time to slow down.

4939
04:09:25,170 --> 04:09:27,790
Only speed, only speed here.

4940
04:09:29,790 --> 04:09:30,470
Okay.

4941
04:09:32,770 --> 04:09:33,770
Oh, hello.

4942
04:09:34,730 --> 04:09:35,410
Alright!

4943
04:09:36,890 --> 04:09:37,230
Okay!

4944
04:09:38,130 --> 04:09:39,390
We got...

4945
04:09:40,850 --> 04:09:42,490
We've got the elevator down.

4946
04:09:45,350 --> 04:09:46,690
Go, go, go!

4947
04:09:51,750 --> 04:09:52,430
Alright.

4948
04:09:52,430 --> 04:09:53,610
Good morning everybody!

4949
04:09:53,790 --> 04:09:54,090
See ya!

4950
04:09:54,170 --> 04:09:54,930
See ya later.

4951
04:09:54,990 --> 04:09:55,150
Bye bye.

4952
04:09:55,170 --> 04:09:56,650
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.

4953
04:10:06,410 --> 04:10:06,890
Okay.

4954
04:10:06,890 --> 04:10:07,370
Now...

4955
04:10:07,370 --> 04:10:08,330
We...

4956
04:10:10,250 --> 04:10:11,210
Go back.

4957
04:10:14,830 --> 04:10:15,310
Wait.

4958
04:10:15,390 --> 04:10:15,890
Oh, I forgot!

4959
04:10:16,050 --> 04:10:17,270
I forgot to shut off the light.

4960
04:10:20,150 --> 04:10:20,790
You're right.

4961
04:10:21,510 --> 04:10:22,530
Why did I...

4962
04:10:22,530 --> 04:10:25,450
I made a grave mistake.

4963
04:10:27,350 --> 04:10:27,830
Wait.

4964
04:10:28,050 --> 04:10:28,350
Okay.

4965
04:10:28,350 --> 04:10:29,210
Then we go back.

4966
04:10:29,390 --> 04:10:30,070
We turn off the light.

4967
04:10:30,190 --> 04:10:31,070
And then we leave again.

4968
04:10:31,410 --> 04:10:31,990
Wait a second.

4969
04:10:32,450 --> 04:10:33,190
Can I leave?

4970
04:10:37,310 --> 04:10:38,390
The lights are on.

4971
04:10:39,370 --> 04:10:39,730
Sorry.

4972
04:10:39,870 --> 04:10:40,630
This is why I was...

4973
04:10:40,630 --> 04:10:42,350
This is why I was like, I should write this down.

4974
04:10:42,470 --> 04:10:45,550
Because the order of operations is gonna be all over in my brain.

4975
04:10:53,520 --> 04:10:53,880
Okay.

4976
04:10:54,540 --> 04:10:55,920
Then we go over here.

4977
04:10:58,920 --> 04:11:00,240
There's so much to keep track of.

4978
04:11:00,240 --> 04:11:01,060
There really is.

4979
04:11:01,140 --> 04:11:01,680
There really is.

4980
04:11:03,120 --> 04:11:03,720
Okay.

4981
04:11:03,720 --> 04:11:04,320
Upwards.

4982
04:11:08,280 --> 04:11:09,700
Why aren't you using the shortcut?

4983
04:11:09,940 --> 04:11:11,240
I don't remember the shortcut!

4984
04:11:13,140 --> 04:11:15,740
I don't remember where Wubba is!

4985
04:11:24,930 --> 04:11:26,410
I don't remember!

4986
04:11:35,680 --> 04:11:37,640
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

4987
04:11:38,520 --> 04:11:39,440
Thank you.

4988
04:11:40,180 --> 04:11:40,780
Okay.

4989
04:11:42,140 --> 04:11:42,840
Now... Okay.

4990
04:11:43,000 --> 04:11:44,500
Now I wake up though, right?

4991
04:11:44,680 --> 04:11:45,660
Because then I...

4992
04:11:46,160 --> 04:11:46,740
Hold on.

4993
04:11:46,880 --> 04:11:47,240
Okay.

4994
04:11:47,620 --> 04:11:48,800
There's no way to drop...

4995
04:11:48,800 --> 04:11:49,680
I have to...

4996
04:11:50,740 --> 04:11:51,180
Yes.

4997
04:11:51,500 --> 04:11:52,580
Now I wake up.

4998
04:11:52,600 --> 04:11:54,460
And then I go back to the...

4999
04:11:54,460 --> 04:11:54,540
Okay.

5000
04:11:55,940 --> 04:11:56,380
Okay.

5001
04:12:00,400 --> 04:12:01,160
Into the water.

5002
04:12:01,480 --> 04:12:01,920
Whoa!

5003
04:12:02,060 --> 04:12:02,400
Whoa!

5004
04:12:03,980 --> 04:12:04,420
Okay.

5005
04:12:07,920 --> 04:12:08,500
See ya!

5006
04:12:14,420 --> 04:12:16,200
You just walked through the shortcut.

5007
04:12:16,860 --> 04:12:17,280
Oh!

5008
04:12:19,400 --> 04:12:19,960
That...

5009
04:12:19,960 --> 04:12:20,120
Oh!

5010
04:12:20,340 --> 04:12:20,680
Okay.

5011
04:12:21,200 --> 04:12:22,040
You know what?

5012
04:12:22,080 --> 04:12:22,600
I'll be honest.

5013
04:12:22,900 --> 04:12:24,340
I don't even notice which...

5014
04:12:24,340 --> 04:12:25,880
Which picture frame it was.

5015
04:12:26,300 --> 04:12:26,860
So...

5016
04:12:31,320 --> 04:12:32,200
I'll be honest.

5017
04:12:33,740 --> 04:12:34,300
Okay.

5018
04:12:34,420 --> 04:12:35,820
Then we have our boat right there.

5019
04:12:36,200 --> 04:12:37,660
All ready to use.

5020
04:12:38,780 --> 04:12:39,900
Ready to...

5021
04:12:39,900 --> 04:12:40,680
Cruise!

5022
04:12:42,340 --> 04:12:42,860
Gustavo!

5023
04:12:43,120 --> 04:12:44,540
Welcome to my cruise ship!

5024
04:12:44,640 --> 04:12:45,100
Thank you!

5025
04:12:45,980 --> 04:12:46,700
Thank you!

5026
04:12:46,720 --> 04:12:46,980
Thank you!

5027
04:12:48,100 --> 04:12:48,620
Wee!

5028
04:12:49,000 --> 04:12:49,520
Okay.

5029
04:12:51,420 --> 04:12:53,040
Did you guys see my short?

5030
04:12:53,280 --> 04:12:53,740
My...

5031
04:12:53,740 --> 04:12:54,760
My snake eater short?

5032
04:12:55,520 --> 04:12:57,380
I was so nervous about it.

5033
04:12:57,400 --> 04:12:58,060
I'm still so nervous.

5034
04:12:58,080 --> 04:12:59,640
I still don't think I sound very good.

5035
04:12:59,740 --> 04:12:59,960
But...

5036
04:12:59,960 --> 04:13:01,580
The comments seem positive enough.

5037
04:13:01,860 --> 04:13:02,220
So...

5038
04:13:02,220 --> 04:13:03,260
Thanks guys.

5039
04:13:03,520 --> 04:13:05,680
If you listen to it...

5040
04:13:06,740 --> 04:13:08,540
It's a song I really don't think...

5041
04:13:08,540 --> 04:13:10,420
I can sing very well.

5042
04:13:10,600 --> 04:13:11,120
But...

5043
04:13:11,120 --> 04:13:12,220
I don't know.

5044
04:13:13,100 --> 04:13:14,580
If you guys say so...

5045
04:13:14,580 --> 04:13:15,240
I'll trust you.

5046
04:13:15,340 --> 04:13:15,600
Maybe.

5047
04:13:20,170 --> 04:13:23,370
I think it's because I wish my voice was a little bit more...

5048
04:13:24,890 --> 04:13:25,870
Soulful, I guess?

5049
04:13:26,070 --> 04:13:26,910
Like a little more...

5050
04:13:27,410 --> 04:13:28,070
You know?

5051
04:13:28,190 --> 04:13:28,610
Something.

5052
04:13:28,850 --> 04:13:29,850
I feel like something's missing.

5053
04:13:37,480 --> 04:13:38,760
Not more idolized.

5054
04:13:41,040 --> 04:13:43,640
Leaving Scout on the Dam makes a good clock.

5055
04:13:44,040 --> 04:13:44,520
Oh!

5056
04:13:45,120 --> 04:13:45,600
Oh!

5057
04:13:46,260 --> 04:13:46,740
Oh!

5058
04:13:46,740 --> 04:13:47,000
Oh!

5059
04:13:47,000 --> 04:13:47,300
Oh!

5060
04:13:47,300 --> 04:13:47,640
Oh!

5061
04:13:48,400 --> 04:13:48,880
Oh!

5062
04:13:48,880 --> 04:13:49,480
Like that!

5063
04:13:51,620 --> 04:13:52,060
Oh!

5064
04:13:52,100 --> 04:13:52,720
That's so...

5065
04:13:54,840 --> 04:13:56,220
It already went down.

5066
04:13:56,840 --> 04:13:57,580
Oh my God!

5067
04:13:57,620 --> 04:13:57,780
Wait!

5068
04:13:57,860 --> 04:13:59,040
It's going down really, really fast!

5069
04:13:59,360 --> 04:13:59,620
Wait!

5070
04:13:59,680 --> 04:13:59,940
Wait!

5071
04:13:59,940 --> 04:14:00,240
Wait!

5072
04:14:00,240 --> 04:14:00,500
Wait!

5073
04:14:00,580 --> 04:14:00,740
Wait!

5074
04:14:00,840 --> 04:14:01,040
Wait!

5075
04:14:01,040 --> 04:14:01,220
Wait!

5076
04:14:01,220 --> 04:14:01,320
Wait!

5077
04:14:01,320 --> 04:14:01,500
Wait!

5078
04:14:01,600 --> 04:14:01,760
Wait!

5079
04:14:01,760 --> 04:14:01,920
Wait!

5080
04:14:01,920 --> 04:14:01,940
Wait!

5081
04:14:02,020 --> 04:14:03,780
It's going down really, really fast!

5082
04:14:08,970 --> 04:14:09,410
Um...

5083
04:14:09,890 --> 04:14:11,250
I don't think we're gonna make it.

5084
04:14:19,760 --> 04:14:20,200
Yo!

5085
04:14:20,380 --> 04:14:21,580
This is so messed up.

5086
04:14:21,920 --> 04:14:23,060
This is so messed up.

5087
04:14:27,110 --> 04:14:28,110
Go to the tower?

5088
04:14:28,570 --> 04:14:29,010
Go to the tower?

5089
04:14:29,430 --> 04:14:29,750
Instead?

5090
04:14:30,110 --> 04:14:31,770
Oh, I guess we could go to the tower instead.

5091
04:14:33,650 --> 04:14:33,970
Okay.

5092
04:14:34,030 --> 04:14:34,850
We'll go to the tower.

5093
04:14:35,010 --> 04:14:35,550
You guys are right.

5094
04:14:35,650 --> 04:14:36,110
You guys are right.

5095
04:14:39,270 --> 04:14:40,470
Yeah, the tower lasts longer.

5096
04:14:40,670 --> 04:14:41,010
You're right.

5097
04:14:41,090 --> 04:14:41,270
You're right.

5098
04:14:41,310 --> 04:14:41,550
You're right.

5099
04:14:41,670 --> 04:14:42,290
And there is...

5100
04:14:42,290 --> 04:14:43,210
We can't get the bolt there.

5101
04:14:44,330 --> 04:14:44,650
Wait.

5102
04:14:44,710 --> 04:14:45,250
How do I...

5103
04:14:45,250 --> 04:14:45,710
Um...

5104
04:14:47,050 --> 04:14:47,370
Um...

5105
04:14:47,370 --> 04:14:48,030
How did I...

5106
04:14:48,370 --> 04:14:49,350
Set that up before?

5107
04:14:50,230 --> 04:14:50,970
I'm trying to think.

5108
04:15:03,380 --> 04:15:03,700
Whoever...

5109
04:15:04,600 --> 04:15:05,240
Suggested that...

5110
04:15:05,240 --> 04:15:06,420
Thank you so much.

5111
04:15:06,520 --> 04:15:07,760
That was such a smart idea.

5112
04:15:09,480 --> 04:15:09,800
Um...

5113
04:15:09,800 --> 04:15:09,880
Um...

5114
04:15:15,660 --> 04:15:16,180
Um...

5115
04:15:19,990 --> 04:15:20,510
Zero!

5116
04:15:21,430 --> 04:15:21,950
Wait!

5117
04:15:23,450 --> 04:15:24,770
Will we make it here too?

5118
04:15:25,110 --> 04:15:25,610
Um...

5119
04:15:26,650 --> 04:15:28,830
Let me just get to the tower first, please.

5120
04:15:29,010 --> 04:15:30,770
Before you come crashing through here.

5121
04:15:31,530 --> 04:15:32,050
Okay.

5122
04:15:56,350 --> 04:15:56,870
Okay!

5123
04:15:56,970 --> 04:15:57,390
Wake up!

5124
04:15:59,890 --> 04:16:01,490
Now, guys, here's the issue.

5125
04:16:02,230 --> 04:16:03,930
I don't quite remember...

5126
04:16:05,670 --> 04:16:10,630
I don't quite remember how we got the boat to reappear... here.

5127
04:16:12,150 --> 04:16:15,770
I don't quite remember how we got this part.

5128
04:16:25,570 --> 04:16:26,520
Gotta loop around.

5129
04:16:27,020 --> 04:16:27,680
Hold on.

5130
04:16:34,450 --> 04:16:35,820
Gosh, there's so much...

5131
04:16:36,960 --> 04:16:38,360
Activate your memory neurons.

5132
04:16:38,440 --> 04:16:38,800
I'm trying!

5133
04:16:38,980 --> 04:16:39,220
I'm trying!

5134
04:16:42,740 --> 04:16:43,720
Yes, you guys are right.

5135
04:16:43,780 --> 04:16:44,500
The door to the left.

5136
04:16:44,580 --> 04:16:45,020
Thank you.

5137
04:16:45,700 --> 04:16:46,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

5138
04:16:48,840 --> 04:16:50,660
Because I was like, we've done it before, so...

5139
04:16:53,240 --> 04:16:55,160
We've done it before, so it's fine.

5140
04:16:56,040 --> 04:16:58,920
If you guys give me a little reminder.

5141
04:17:02,540 --> 04:17:04,240
Yeah, remember how you forgore.

5142
04:17:04,420 --> 04:17:04,860
You're right!

5143
04:17:05,460 --> 04:17:11,640
I forgore how to go places... or how to go through doors when they are...

5144
04:17:11,660 --> 04:17:12,080
not open.

5145
04:17:12,820 --> 04:17:13,140
Okay.

5146
04:17:15,220 --> 04:17:16,040
Now we travel.

5147
04:17:19,140 --> 04:17:19,460
Run!

5148
04:17:19,640 --> 04:17:19,880
Run!

5149
04:17:20,000 --> 04:17:20,120
Run!

5150
04:17:23,240 --> 04:17:24,760
I wish I could run faster!

5151
04:17:32,710 --> 04:17:33,030
Okay.

5152
04:17:33,030 --> 04:17:33,470
Come on!

5153
04:17:33,530 --> 04:17:33,710
Come on!

5154
04:17:33,750 --> 04:17:34,090
Come on!

5155
04:17:34,230 --> 04:17:34,430
Come on!

5156
04:17:34,830 --> 04:17:35,330
Come on!

5157
04:17:35,330 --> 04:17:35,490
Come on!

5158
04:17:35,490 --> 04:17:35,710
Come on!

5159
04:17:35,710 --> 04:17:35,970
Come on!

5160
04:17:35,990 --> 04:17:36,070
Come on!

5161
04:17:36,070 --> 04:17:36,930
Please, come here.

5162
04:17:38,550 --> 04:17:39,030
Come here!

5163
04:17:39,110 --> 04:17:39,390
Come here!

5164
04:17:39,410 --> 04:17:39,670
Come here!

5165
04:17:40,210 --> 04:17:40,530
Come here!

5166
04:17:40,830 --> 04:17:41,350
Come here!

5167
04:17:41,410 --> 04:17:41,850
Come here!

5168
04:17:49,000 --> 04:17:49,360
There we go.

5169
04:17:57,330 --> 04:17:58,810
Is this the one?

5170
04:17:59,590 --> 04:18:00,710
I think so!

5171
04:18:02,110 --> 04:18:03,330
Here we are!

5172
04:18:06,070 --> 04:18:07,170
Full speed ahead!

5173
04:18:09,450 --> 04:18:10,470
Okay, maybe not so fast.

5174
04:18:11,170 --> 04:18:13,230
Let me be able to get off the boat, please.

5175
04:18:16,570 --> 04:18:16,990
Okay.

5176
04:18:17,470 --> 04:18:17,710
Go!

5177
04:18:17,870 --> 04:18:17,910
Go!

5178
04:18:17,970 --> 04:18:18,130
Go!

5179
04:18:18,130 --> 04:18:18,270
Go!

5180
04:18:18,370 --> 04:18:18,370
Go!

5181
04:18:26,670 --> 04:18:27,570
Oh my God!

5182
04:18:27,690 --> 04:18:28,110
Oh my God!

5183
04:18:28,150 --> 04:18:28,770
This might work!

5184
04:18:28,890 --> 04:18:29,450
This might work!

5185
04:18:29,670 --> 04:18:29,990
Please!

5186
04:18:30,250 --> 04:18:30,650
Please!

5187
04:18:30,710 --> 04:18:31,090
Please!

5188
04:18:31,090 --> 04:18:31,430
Please!

5189
04:18:31,430 --> 04:18:31,710
Please!

5190
04:18:31,710 --> 04:18:31,950
Please!

5191
04:18:59,920 --> 04:19:01,040
I'm going the right way, right?

5192
04:19:10,400 --> 04:19:11,420
I see like a...

5193
04:19:15,070 --> 04:19:17,510
I see like a flashing there.

5194
04:19:17,670 --> 04:19:18,370
Do you guys see that?

5195
04:19:19,630 --> 04:19:20,030
Oh.

5196
04:19:20,690 --> 04:19:22,250
I'm... I'm... I'm in a wall.

5197
04:19:23,350 --> 04:19:24,830
Uh, I can't see anything.

5198
04:19:32,960 --> 04:19:35,880
Time is precious, I know, but I can't see anything, you guys.

5199
04:20:17,940 --> 04:20:18,720
What is this?

5200
04:20:28,760 --> 04:20:32,240
Wait, what's going on?

5201
04:20:32,960 --> 04:20:33,380
Upstairs?

5202
04:20:35,480 --> 04:20:36,320
Where am I?

5203
04:20:36,440 --> 04:20:37,520
I can't see anything again.

5204
04:20:38,500 --> 04:20:39,020
Eh?

5205
04:20:43,860 --> 04:20:50,270
I've never seen anyone do the puzzle this way.

5206
04:20:50,930 --> 04:20:51,970
Thank you!

5207
04:20:52,310 --> 04:20:52,830
Oh, here?

5208
04:20:56,110 --> 04:20:56,630
Oh!

5209
04:20:56,710 --> 04:20:56,990
Oh!

5210
04:20:57,070 --> 04:20:57,330
Oh!

5211
04:20:57,330 --> 04:20:57,530
Oh!

5212
04:20:57,530 --> 04:20:57,750
Oh!

5213
04:20:57,750 --> 04:20:57,910
Oh!

5214
04:20:57,910 --> 04:20:58,090
Oh!

5215
04:20:58,090 --> 04:20:58,130
Oh!

5216
04:20:58,130 --> 04:20:58,910
Goodness gracious.

5217
04:20:59,170 --> 04:20:59,370
Okay.

5218
04:20:59,970 --> 04:21:02,670
Oh gosh, it's really dark though, so I can't see anything.

5219
04:21:05,290 --> 04:21:07,910
I can get my artifact back.

5220
04:21:08,730 --> 04:21:09,250
Okay.

5221
04:21:10,950 --> 04:21:12,750
Now it opens the doors.

5222
04:21:15,930 --> 04:21:16,930
It's so over.

5223
04:21:17,050 --> 04:21:17,290
Stop!

5224
04:21:17,830 --> 04:21:18,330
Stop!

5225
04:21:18,590 --> 04:21:19,510
I'm grabbing them!

5226
04:21:19,610 --> 04:21:20,130
I'm grabbing them!

5227
04:21:20,190 --> 04:21:20,750
I'm grabbing them!

5228
04:21:23,070 --> 04:21:24,070
Not yet!

5229
04:21:24,710 --> 04:21:25,310
Not yet!

5230
04:21:25,410 --> 04:21:26,510
It's not over yet!

5231
04:21:26,710 --> 04:21:27,510
I've got to put them in.

5232
04:21:29,010 --> 04:21:29,670
There we go.

5233
04:21:32,470 --> 04:21:32,970
Okay.

5234
04:21:36,630 --> 04:21:37,130
Okay,

5235
04:21:44,440 --> 04:21:44,840
there we go.

5236
04:21:44,860 --> 04:21:46,760
I think we've seen this one.

5237
04:21:46,920 --> 04:21:47,320
And they cry.

5238
04:21:47,500 --> 04:21:48,260
They're so sad.

5239
04:21:48,420 --> 04:21:49,120
Yeah, I remember this.

5240
04:21:49,980 --> 04:21:50,380
Oh!

5241
04:21:50,800 --> 04:21:52,120
This is the part that was blacked out.

5242
04:21:54,320 --> 04:21:55,520
What is that thing?

5243
04:21:55,680 --> 04:21:56,800
It looks like a Digimon.

5244
04:21:57,140 --> 04:21:57,840
Like, you know?

5245
04:22:01,420 --> 04:22:02,720
Okay, they're like...

5246
04:22:04,580 --> 04:22:05,480
Let's go home!

5247
04:22:06,520 --> 04:22:07,720
In our dream world!

5248
04:22:08,380 --> 04:22:09,260
They fall asleep.

5249
04:22:10,560 --> 04:22:12,400
And they're like happy, happy boys.

5250
04:22:12,760 --> 04:22:14,160
Yeah, the DigiBites.

5251
04:22:14,300 --> 04:22:14,440
Yeah.

5252
04:22:14,860 --> 04:22:15,540
Okay.

5253
04:22:17,740 --> 04:22:19,540
So that's what happened there.

5254
04:22:22,900 --> 04:22:24,240
And there was another one.

5255
04:22:30,460 --> 04:22:31,240
Got it?

5256
04:22:32,620 --> 04:22:34,080
Just had to use my leggies.

5257
04:22:35,520 --> 04:22:36,200
Okay.

5258
04:22:39,930 --> 04:22:40,610
Alrighty.

5259
04:22:42,130 --> 04:22:42,810
Oh!

5260
04:22:42,810 --> 04:22:44,250
Digital Saturn.

5261
04:22:45,790 --> 04:22:47,110
He's walking...

5262
04:22:47,110 --> 04:22:47,470
And...

5263
04:22:48,770 --> 04:22:49,810
In his...

5264
04:22:49,810 --> 04:22:50,650
What the hell?

5265
04:22:52,890 --> 04:22:54,330
It says stuff.

5266
04:22:59,610 --> 04:23:00,150
What?

5267
04:23:06,980 --> 04:23:08,840
So if I leave my...

5268
04:23:08,840 --> 04:23:13,380
If I drop my artifact and go too far away from it, I become a Polygon.

5269
04:23:14,860 --> 04:23:17,540
I literally become Polygon from Metal Gear.

5270
04:23:24,980 --> 04:23:25,620
Cool.

5271
04:23:30,590 --> 04:23:31,550
Very cool.

5272
04:23:31,850 --> 04:23:32,230
Yeah.

5273
04:23:32,250 --> 04:23:33,010
PS1 asset.

5274
04:23:35,110 --> 04:23:36,550
Can I go through here?

5275
04:23:37,050 --> 04:23:37,690
No.

5276
04:23:38,890 --> 04:23:40,930
Is that everything in this area?

5277
04:23:44,570 --> 04:23:45,490
What if I...

5278
04:23:45,490 --> 04:23:45,770
How...

5279
04:23:48,310 --> 04:23:49,690
Oh, clearly not.

5280
04:23:49,830 --> 04:23:50,170
Oh!

5281
04:23:50,230 --> 04:23:50,870
Whoa!

5282
04:23:51,070 --> 04:23:51,930
What's happening?

5283
04:23:52,090 --> 04:23:52,570
Oh!

5284
04:23:52,690 --> 04:23:52,930
Oh!

5285
04:23:52,930 --> 04:23:54,010
I think my game just crashed?

5286
04:23:54,210 --> 04:23:54,690
Wait!

5287
04:23:54,930 --> 04:23:55,410
No!

5288
04:24:18,260 --> 04:24:18,740
Um...

5289
04:24:22,620 --> 04:24:25,100
No, I didn't get any of the information!

5290
04:24:55,240 --> 04:24:56,680
Do I have to exit my game?

5291
04:25:00,360 --> 04:25:00,840
Oh...

5292
04:25:26,910 --> 04:25:28,730
You got all the info from that place?

5293
04:25:30,830 --> 04:25:32,250
But it's not gonna update.

5294
04:25:32,430 --> 04:25:34,550
Is that okay if it doesn't update in the...

5295
04:25:36,130 --> 04:25:38,230
If it doesn't update in...

5296
04:25:43,270 --> 04:25:44,070
Just kidding.

5297
04:25:55,370 --> 04:25:58,270
Actually now that I know it's all a simulation...

5298
04:26:05,060 --> 04:26:05,460
Wait!

5299
04:26:05,560 --> 04:26:06,000
Oh wait!

5300
04:26:06,080 --> 04:26:06,820
Maybe it did update!

5301
04:26:07,300 --> 04:26:07,920
Forbidden archive!

5302
04:26:09,780 --> 04:26:10,180
Wait!

5303
04:26:10,440 --> 04:26:11,840
There's more to explore here.

5304
04:26:12,060 --> 04:26:13,540
Okay, we gotta go back, you guys!

5305
04:26:17,700 --> 04:26:20,600
Who knew that this was literally VR missions?

5306
04:26:22,700 --> 04:26:25,260
Library full of intact slide rails hidden deep underground.

5307
04:26:25,420 --> 04:26:26,580
I found a slide rail that shows that...

5308
04:26:33,400 --> 04:26:42,980
Wait, so they're all just, like, in this simulation, and that's... they're all, like, they... they, like, sword art-onlined it.

5309
04:26:43,520 --> 04:26:49,020
And, like, never wanted to wake up because they all were just so much happier being at home.

5310
04:26:51,560 --> 04:26:52,720
Oh my god.

5311
04:27:00,170 --> 04:27:02,150
So they're all so much dead.

5312
04:27:02,270 --> 04:27:03,550
It's just their, like, consciousness.

5313
04:27:07,630 --> 04:27:09,310
Well, if they actually wake up, they die.

5314
04:27:09,530 --> 04:27:10,150
Yeah, yeah.

5315
04:27:12,310 --> 04:27:13,210
I found a slide.

5316
04:27:13,290 --> 04:27:15,290
Oh, some sort of error report.

5317
04:27:15,630 --> 04:27:22,210
It shows one of the strangers as an inhabitant dropping their artifact on the ground and walking beyond its projection radius.

5318
04:27:22,770 --> 04:27:23,750
You name it!

5319
04:27:23,850 --> 04:27:24,570
Thanks for the five gifted!

5320
04:27:26,770 --> 04:27:28,270
There's more to explore here.

5321
04:27:30,910 --> 04:27:31,350
So...

5322
04:27:32,310 --> 04:27:34,050
If I go back...

5323
04:27:38,780 --> 04:27:41,340
I've reached the tower's upper floors by protecting a power... wait.

5324
04:27:42,880 --> 04:27:44,380
Oh, that's just the more to explore.

5325
04:27:45,880 --> 04:27:46,760
If I...

5326
04:27:54,000 --> 04:27:56,200
You don't have to do everything all over again, trust?

5327
04:28:02,580 --> 04:28:03,740
There's a code in there.

5328
04:28:07,860 --> 04:28:08,660
Yeah, I'm gonna...

5329
04:28:08,660 --> 04:28:10,380
I'm gonna try the new thing that we just learned.

5330
04:28:10,580 --> 04:28:13,680
That was probably the best... one to start with, maybe.

5331
04:28:14,520 --> 04:28:16,220
I feel like...

5332
04:28:16,220 --> 04:28:17,180
Oh, uh-oh.

5333
04:28:17,380 --> 04:28:21,040
I do not know where the planet is.

5334
04:28:21,380 --> 04:28:22,220
One moment.

5335
04:28:22,440 --> 04:28:23,340
Don't crash.

5336
04:28:24,420 --> 04:28:25,760
Actually, buckle up, everybody.

5337
04:28:27,400 --> 04:28:29,400
I don't know where the stranger is.

5338
04:28:29,740 --> 04:28:31,380
It's some...

5339
04:28:33,760 --> 04:28:34,320
Um...

5340
04:28:38,250 --> 04:28:38,810
It's...

5341
04:28:38,810 --> 04:28:38,890
It's...

5342
04:28:40,070 --> 04:28:40,510
It's...

5343
04:28:41,630 --> 04:28:42,250
I know.

5344
04:28:42,310 --> 04:28:42,630
Hold on.

5345
04:28:42,710 --> 04:28:43,370
I know where it is.

5346
04:28:44,090 --> 04:28:45,470
It's up there, obviously.

5347
04:28:45,730 --> 04:28:46,510
Gosh, you guys.

5348
04:28:46,910 --> 04:28:47,770
It's right there.

5349
04:28:48,170 --> 04:28:48,550
Duh.

5350
04:28:52,410 --> 04:28:52,850
Duh.

5351
04:28:53,290 --> 04:28:54,170
It's right there.

5352
04:29:02,090 --> 04:29:04,430
We're gonna try our new trick.

5353
04:29:05,410 --> 04:29:06,450
Our ghost trick.

5354
04:29:10,180 --> 04:29:12,340
The recordings are the game plan.

5355
04:29:13,460 --> 04:29:15,180
I'm just worried that...

5356
04:29:17,560 --> 04:29:18,380
Oh my god.

5357
04:29:19,520 --> 04:29:20,280
We're fine.

5358
04:29:20,740 --> 04:29:22,140
Anyway, um...

5359
04:29:23,340 --> 04:29:24,360
Do a flip.

5360
04:29:27,220 --> 04:29:27,800
Perfect.

5361
04:29:30,740 --> 04:29:31,320
Okay.

5362
04:29:31,950 --> 04:29:32,880
Right by the entrance.

5363
04:29:33,540 --> 04:29:34,760
That's where we need to go.

5364
04:29:35,440 --> 04:29:36,700
Wait, what was the super chat?

5365
04:29:38,780 --> 04:29:41,160
They did the thing where you fly to a foreign country.

5366
04:29:41,280 --> 04:29:41,380
Oh.

5367
04:29:43,420 --> 04:29:46,300
Stay in the hotel room and play games on your laptop the whole time.

5368
04:29:49,000 --> 04:29:49,700
It's true.

5369
04:29:50,180 --> 04:29:51,080
Well, that was me.

5370
04:29:51,940 --> 04:29:52,700
But, um...

5371
04:29:53,600 --> 04:29:54,080
Involuntarily.

5372
04:29:57,100 --> 04:29:57,580
Okay.

5373
04:30:06,360 --> 04:30:07,300
I'm kind of...

5374
04:30:08,220 --> 04:30:09,180
Confused how...

5375
04:30:09,180 --> 04:30:11,040
I'm supposed to do this.

5376
04:30:11,620 --> 04:30:12,100
Now...

5377
04:30:12,100 --> 04:30:12,820
Um...

5378
04:30:12,820 --> 04:30:12,980
I don't know.

5379
04:30:13,640 --> 04:30:16,420
So, I'm guessing it's easier to avoid them...

5380
04:30:17,740 --> 04:30:21,540
If I can see where they are because of this new trick, right?

5381
04:30:22,000 --> 04:30:23,300
I'm guessing that's...

5382
04:30:23,920 --> 04:30:25,020
The deal, yo.

5383
04:30:30,120 --> 04:30:32,000
Oh my goodness.

5384
04:30:33,340 --> 04:30:35,720
Or maybe they won't even see me.

5385
04:30:35,800 --> 04:30:36,180
Who knows?

5386
04:30:38,820 --> 04:30:40,200
Maybe I will be able to...

5387
04:30:40,200 --> 04:30:40,480
Like...

5388
04:30:40,480 --> 04:30:41,180
When I...

5389
04:30:41,180 --> 04:30:41,980
Oh my god.

5390
04:30:42,040 --> 04:30:42,760
Oh, that was close.

5391
04:30:43,960 --> 04:30:45,860
When I did it in there...

5392
04:30:46,720 --> 04:30:47,160
I...

5393
04:30:48,880 --> 04:30:51,300
I was able to like walk through the walls and stuff.

5394
04:30:51,860 --> 04:30:52,300
So...

5395
04:30:53,640 --> 04:30:55,360
I'm literally hacking their game.

5396
04:30:57,540 --> 04:30:59,620
I'm gonna hack the game so that...

5397
04:31:00,180 --> 04:31:02,240
Instead of little alien people, they're all...

5398
04:31:02,240 --> 04:31:03,980
Big, booby anime girls.

5399
04:31:05,160 --> 04:31:06,540
Jeffrey, I'm hacking your game.

5400
04:31:09,280 --> 04:31:10,240
In a good way.

5401
04:31:15,080 --> 04:31:16,140
In a good way.

5402
04:31:16,180 --> 04:31:16,720
In a good way.

5403
04:31:18,320 --> 04:31:19,160
Hacked wild.

5404
04:31:20,480 --> 04:31:21,680
Dot hack wild.

5405
04:31:24,300 --> 04:31:25,480
Oh my gosh.

5406
04:31:25,980 --> 04:31:27,100
I only...

5407
04:31:27,100 --> 04:31:29,120
I actually only read dot hack.

5408
04:31:31,400 --> 04:31:31,960
Um...

5409
04:31:33,260 --> 04:31:33,820
Uh...

5410
04:31:34,900 --> 04:31:36,460
I watched a little bit.

5411
04:31:36,480 --> 04:31:37,920
I didn't finish dot hack sign.

5412
04:31:39,600 --> 04:31:40,640
Oh, what was the...

5413
04:31:40,640 --> 04:31:41,060
There was like...

5414
04:31:41,060 --> 04:31:42,540
One where they were cuter.

5415
04:31:44,180 --> 04:31:44,740
Oh...

5416
04:31:47,390 --> 04:31:47,850
Um...

5417
04:31:49,210 --> 04:31:51,390
The Legend of the Twilight Bracelet, I think it was...

5418
04:31:51,390 --> 04:31:52,130
Legend of the...

5419
04:31:52,130 --> 04:31:52,710
Something bra...

5420
04:31:52,710 --> 04:31:53,390
Legend of the...

5421
04:31:53,390 --> 04:31:55,430
No, not G.U.

5422
04:31:55,630 --> 04:31:57,450
She's figuring out how to actually press the button.

5423
04:31:57,510 --> 04:32:00,030
She's been thinking about that since the stream.

5424
04:32:04,570 --> 04:32:05,190
We're fine.

5425
04:32:06,430 --> 04:32:07,650
No, not G.U.

5426
04:32:07,650 --> 04:32:09,230
Yeah, Legend of the Twilight.

5427
04:32:09,830 --> 04:32:11,330
I was like, Twilight Bracelet.

5428
04:32:11,750 --> 04:32:13,390
There's something with a bracelet in it.

5429
04:32:13,430 --> 04:32:13,730
That's why.

5430
04:32:14,530 --> 04:32:14,990
Oh...

5431
04:32:15,550 --> 04:32:16,010
Okay.

5432
04:32:16,390 --> 04:32:16,850
Okay.

5433
04:32:16,850 --> 04:32:18,470
Oh, it is Twilight Bracelet.

5434
04:32:20,550 --> 04:32:22,130
Legends of the twilight.

5435
04:32:22,310 --> 04:32:22,410
Oh.

5436
04:32:22,970 --> 04:32:24,370
Well, actually...

5437
04:32:24,370 --> 04:32:27,230
It's called Legends of the Twilight.

5438
04:32:30,030 --> 04:32:31,810
Um, actually.

5439
04:32:32,770 --> 04:32:33,770
Um, actually.

5440
04:32:33,910 --> 04:32:36,050
It's called Legends of the Twilight.

5441
04:32:38,890 --> 04:32:41,170
I listen to the sign OST like weekly.

5442
04:32:41,450 --> 04:32:43,690
Yeah, because it's like Kajiura Yuuki.

5443
04:32:44,450 --> 04:32:45,030
Yes.

5444
04:32:45,030 --> 04:32:45,250
Yes.

5445
04:32:46,250 --> 04:32:47,210
God composer.

5446
04:32:49,410 --> 04:32:49,890
Tobias!

5447
04:32:49,890 --> 04:32:51,650
Thanks for the tank gift and thank you!

5448
04:33:00,120 --> 04:33:03,160
I'm surprised we haven't seen more... the attacks.

5449
04:33:10,290 --> 04:33:10,990
I don't know.

5450
04:33:11,090 --> 04:33:12,030
It just feels like...

5451
04:33:12,530 --> 04:33:15,130
It's not another... like a franchise that they would continue.

5452
04:33:15,450 --> 04:33:17,670
Unless I... Unless there has been and I just don't know.

5453
04:33:21,960 --> 04:33:23,100
SAO killed it?

5454
04:33:23,280 --> 04:33:23,400
No!

5455
04:33:23,740 --> 04:33:24,780
I don't think so.

5456
04:33:24,780 --> 04:33:27,420
I know people would compare it but...

5457
04:33:27,420 --> 04:33:29,300
I think they're different enough.

5458
04:33:30,440 --> 04:33:33,740
So if I just leave this here... See ya!

5459
04:33:35,680 --> 04:33:38,140
An attempt to leave.

5460
04:33:41,200 --> 04:33:42,540
I'm walking up the stairs.

5461
04:33:44,100 --> 04:33:46,180
Maybe I should have left... Okay, hold on.

5462
04:33:46,260 --> 04:33:47,320
Maybe this was a bad idea.

5463
04:33:51,140 --> 04:33:51,820
You guys...

5464
04:33:55,140 --> 04:33:56,240
You guys...

5465
04:33:58,660 --> 04:33:59,440
I'm good?

5466
04:34:24,020 --> 04:34:25,780
When does it activate?

5467
04:34:30,050 --> 04:34:31,250
When does it activate?

5468
04:34:41,650 --> 04:34:43,050
I'm stuck in a corner.

5469
04:34:45,190 --> 04:34:46,470
Okay, that...

5470
04:34:53,820 --> 04:34:55,480
I saw light for a second.

5471
04:34:56,300 --> 04:34:57,520
I'm looking around.

5472
04:34:57,880 --> 04:34:59,140
I'm turning my head.

5473
04:34:59,140 --> 04:35:00,460
We had jump.

5474
04:35:02,060 --> 04:35:02,820
I'm stuck!

5475
04:35:09,840 --> 04:35:11,380
What do you think that is?

5476
04:35:16,710 --> 04:35:17,950
Wait, what do you think that is?

5477
04:35:22,110 --> 04:35:22,870
Tower staircase.

5478
04:35:25,250 --> 04:35:26,570
Wait, so where am I?

5479
04:35:27,590 --> 04:35:28,070
Lost.

5480
04:35:31,050 --> 04:35:32,170
Light from the fire.

5481
04:35:38,320 --> 04:35:38,800
Um...

5482
04:35:44,630 --> 04:35:46,710
Anyway, okay, let's continue.

5483
04:35:53,350 --> 04:35:55,490
Okay, I'm gonna leave it right...

5484
04:35:57,070 --> 04:35:57,950
Right here.

5485
04:36:16,270 --> 04:36:17,410
There's even a...

5486
04:36:18,030 --> 04:36:19,210
Do you think I can fall onto that?

5487
04:36:26,670 --> 04:36:28,410
I think I can fall onto that?

5488
04:36:34,810 --> 04:36:35,470
Anyway.

5489
04:36:37,110 --> 04:36:38,090
Total flip!

5490
04:36:40,310 --> 04:36:40,970
Okay.

5491
04:36:41,410 --> 04:36:42,450
Second goal.

5492
04:36:48,310 --> 04:36:49,330
Well, we tried.

5493
04:36:49,910 --> 04:36:51,210
There was an attempt.

5494
04:36:57,030 --> 04:36:57,690
Sha!

5495
04:36:59,230 --> 04:36:59,890
Wow!

5496
04:37:00,370 --> 04:37:02,030
This is so much fun.

5497
04:37:02,030 --> 04:37:02,350
Oh, beautiful!

5498
04:37:07,210 --> 04:37:13,090
Oh my god!

5499
04:37:16,750 --> 04:37:18,170
This is so pretty!

5500
04:37:23,470 --> 04:37:24,630
Game changer.

5501
04:37:25,110 --> 04:37:26,150
For real though!

5502
04:37:26,850 --> 04:37:28,330
Oh my god.

5503
04:37:29,690 --> 04:37:30,270
Wow!

5504
04:37:32,030 --> 04:37:32,310
Wow!

5505
04:37:33,290 --> 04:37:34,930
Still, this doesn't work though.

5506
04:37:35,450 --> 04:37:36,770
The game is borked.

5507
04:37:39,490 --> 04:37:40,510
Wait, can I...

5508
04:37:41,030 --> 04:37:43,330
Oh, but it's still... the lights still need to be off.

5509
04:37:44,670 --> 04:37:46,330
And I can't go through here either.

5510
04:37:47,410 --> 04:37:47,930
Okay.

5511
04:37:50,350 --> 04:37:52,690
We still need to turn the lights off though.

5512
04:37:53,130 --> 04:37:55,410
But let's explore a little bit, I think.

5513
04:37:55,910 --> 04:37:57,150
But also...

5514
04:37:58,310 --> 04:38:01,270
Also, how will I work the grabby grabs?

5515
04:38:02,030 --> 04:38:03,410
Yeah, see, I can't even get over.

5516
04:38:06,570 --> 04:38:07,530
Yeah, okay.

5517
04:38:11,330 --> 04:38:14,310
But now if I turn it off, it's so easy to get over there.

5518
04:38:17,110 --> 04:38:19,530
I'll have to forfeit my artifact though.

5519
04:38:22,310 --> 04:38:23,930
I love VRChat!

5520
04:38:28,430 --> 04:38:28,910
Wait!

5521
04:38:32,650 --> 04:38:37,110
Yeah, wait, can I take that hidden path with my artifact?

5522
04:38:38,170 --> 04:38:38,690
Oh!

5523
04:38:43,730 --> 04:38:45,590
I like the music even with it.

5524
04:38:45,650 --> 04:38:45,930
Hold on.

5525
04:38:46,870 --> 04:38:47,570
Okay, wait.

5526
04:38:47,990 --> 04:38:48,670
What's this?

5527
04:38:48,830 --> 04:38:49,730
Is it this one?

5528
04:38:50,850 --> 04:38:51,370
No.

5529
04:38:52,350 --> 04:38:53,010
This one.

5530
04:38:54,530 --> 04:38:55,050
Yes.

5531
04:39:00,610 --> 04:39:01,130
Push!

5532
04:39:02,450 --> 04:39:03,290
My shoes!

5533
04:39:04,390 --> 04:39:04,910
Weeeeee!

5534
04:39:19,440 --> 04:39:22,400
Now, I don't... I'm not quite sure if the path works.

5535
04:39:23,220 --> 04:39:26,060
I guess it would because there was that hidden path, right?

5536
04:39:26,760 --> 04:39:27,600
Is it here?

5537
04:39:27,900 --> 04:39:28,640
Oh god, wait.

5538
04:39:28,880 --> 04:39:29,640
It's here, right?

5539
04:39:30,720 --> 04:39:31,300
I'm scared.

5540
04:39:31,460 --> 04:39:31,740
Wait.

5541
04:39:33,500 --> 04:39:35,260
I don't want to fall into the abyss.

5542
04:39:42,070 --> 04:39:42,810
Let's just check.

5543
04:39:43,130 --> 04:39:44,530
We can set it down and we can check.

5544
04:39:45,970 --> 04:39:46,390
Drop.

5545
04:39:53,000 --> 04:39:53,400
Whoa!

5546
04:39:53,740 --> 04:39:54,660
Okay, okay, okay.

5547
04:39:54,980 --> 04:39:56,080
Way more to the right.

5548
04:39:56,180 --> 04:39:56,760
Okay, okay, okay.

5549
04:40:01,660 --> 04:40:02,060
Wow!

5550
04:40:02,900 --> 04:40:03,820
I guess I just...

5551
04:40:03,820 --> 04:40:06,280
You just never think to drop your thing, right?

5552
04:40:07,740 --> 04:40:08,140
Like...

5553
04:40:14,400 --> 04:40:17,900
You just never think to get rid of your artifact, so...

5554
04:40:23,520 --> 04:40:23,920
Oh.

5555
04:40:35,900 --> 04:40:36,300
Crazy.

5556
04:40:40,400 --> 04:40:41,220
Mind the gap.

5557
04:40:42,660 --> 04:40:44,400
I wonder now though...

5558
04:40:44,400 --> 04:40:45,800
Wait, which one is it?

5559
04:40:49,710 --> 04:40:50,650
This goes outside.

5560
04:40:51,310 --> 04:40:52,230
So it's this one.

5561
04:40:56,280 --> 04:40:59,000
I'm curious if I just go without...

5562
04:40:59,000 --> 04:41:00,080
Oh my goodness.

5563
04:41:00,260 --> 04:41:00,540
Uh oh.

5564
04:41:01,620 --> 04:41:02,540
Oh, it's already off.

5565
04:41:02,660 --> 04:41:03,120
Okay, never mind.

5566
04:41:03,200 --> 04:41:03,560
My bad.

5567
04:41:03,900 --> 04:41:05,560
I wonder if I go...

5568
04:41:07,840 --> 04:41:09,760
Without even holding this thing.

5569
04:41:09,900 --> 04:41:11,600
I'm kind of curious what will happen.

5570
04:41:16,440 --> 04:41:17,800
I'm just gonna drop it.

5571
04:41:22,300 --> 04:41:22,860
Okay.

5572
04:41:23,340 --> 04:41:24,340
Just curious.

5573
04:41:31,860 --> 04:41:32,420
Huh.

5574
04:41:33,560 --> 04:41:34,120
Huh.

5575
04:41:40,010 --> 04:41:41,230
What's up down there?

5576
04:41:41,290 --> 04:41:42,650
What's going on down there?

5577
04:41:44,490 --> 04:41:46,110
How are you going to use the elevator?

5578
04:41:46,630 --> 04:41:47,030
Oh.

5579
04:41:49,250 --> 04:41:50,050
Good question.

5580
04:41:52,030 --> 04:41:53,130
But let me see...

5581
04:41:53,130 --> 04:41:54,950
I want to see if there's a guy down here too, okay?

5582
04:42:04,100 --> 04:42:04,900
Oh, okay.

5583
04:42:06,340 --> 04:42:08,980
Have your spine adjusted by a pursuer?

5584
04:42:12,120 --> 04:42:14,060
Oh, and I came... Okay, I still have it though.

5585
04:42:15,800 --> 04:42:16,200
Wow.

5586
04:42:16,200 --> 04:42:18,280
Okay, so that guy is not so nice.

5587
04:42:18,740 --> 04:42:19,860
That guy is a little mean.

5588
04:42:21,620 --> 04:42:22,020
Hmm.

5589
04:42:25,660 --> 04:42:26,400
Okay, cool.

5590
04:42:26,620 --> 04:42:27,940
Well, there is a guy down there.

5591
04:42:28,080 --> 04:42:28,640
Good to know.

5592
04:42:36,320 --> 04:42:37,440
Still think they're friendly?

5593
04:42:40,640 --> 04:42:41,440
You guys...

5594
04:42:41,440 --> 04:42:43,540
But I was just like, I don't think they're friendly.

5595
04:42:43,800 --> 04:42:45,560
It was you guys that were just like...

5596
04:42:46,060 --> 04:42:47,060
No, they're friendly.

5597
04:42:47,300 --> 04:42:50,080
He's mad because I clearly turned off his TV shows.

5598
04:42:51,720 --> 04:42:54,360
I don't know if I have enough time, but we can try.

5599
04:42:56,280 --> 04:42:57,200
I really don't think so.

5600
04:42:57,200 --> 04:42:58,140
I don't think I have a lot of time left.

5601
04:42:59,280 --> 04:43:01,820
This makes me just want to play everything...

5602
04:43:05,280 --> 04:43:05,800
Without...

5603
04:43:05,800 --> 04:43:06,420
Okay.

5604
04:43:08,400 --> 04:43:08,920
Without...

5605
04:43:09,660 --> 04:43:10,660
The artifact.

5606
04:43:11,320 --> 04:43:11,380
Ah!

5607
04:43:14,780 --> 04:43:15,300
Huh?

5608
04:43:15,560 --> 04:43:16,320
Did it get shorter?

5609
04:43:27,620 --> 04:43:28,880
Oh, I walked off the...

5610
04:43:30,100 --> 04:43:30,620
Oh.

5611
04:43:31,920 --> 04:43:33,340
You have to point at the elevator.

5612
04:43:34,320 --> 04:43:34,840
Oh.

5613
04:43:37,780 --> 04:43:39,100
One more time!

5614
04:43:42,370 --> 04:43:43,650
Shortest nap in existence.

5615
04:43:44,450 --> 04:43:45,850
I nap for one second.

5616
04:43:46,150 --> 04:43:46,490
Can you...

5617
04:43:47,170 --> 04:43:47,410
Gosh.

5618
04:43:47,630 --> 04:43:50,910
I would love to be able to just close my eyes and fall asleep.

5619
04:43:53,090 --> 04:43:55,470
I have a lot of trouble falling asleep.

5620
04:43:56,170 --> 04:43:56,830
You know.

5621
04:43:58,890 --> 04:44:00,330
I'm like always...

5622
04:44:01,430 --> 04:44:02,150
I'll be...

5623
04:44:02,150 --> 04:44:04,290
I'll be rolling around for like...

5624
04:44:07,980 --> 04:44:08,460
Okay.

5625
04:44:09,660 --> 04:44:10,480
So the elevator.

5626
04:44:11,440 --> 04:44:12,480
Is that the elevator?

5627
04:44:26,790 --> 04:44:29,430
Keep the little tree on each side of your...

5628
04:44:36,400 --> 04:44:37,980
I can't with this.

5629
04:44:38,040 --> 04:44:38,900
I can't with this.

5630
04:44:40,900 --> 04:44:41,780
We're gonna...

5631
04:44:41,780 --> 04:44:42,000
The...

5632
04:44:42,580 --> 04:44:43,140
The...

5633
04:44:43,140 --> 04:44:45,400
The tower is gonna fall at this rate.

5634
04:44:46,240 --> 04:44:47,720
It's all my fault though.

5635
04:44:50,300 --> 04:44:51,760
It's all my fault though.

5636
04:44:51,880 --> 04:44:53,320
Hold on, I'm gonna put this here.

5637
04:44:54,300 --> 04:44:55,160
And we're just...

5638
04:44:55,160 --> 04:44:56,480
I'm just gonna go check, okay?

5639
04:44:57,840 --> 04:44:58,360
Okay.

5640
04:44:59,460 --> 04:45:00,860
What is my landmark?

5641
04:45:03,980 --> 04:45:04,500
Tree?

5642
04:45:06,040 --> 04:45:07,420
In between the trees?

5643
04:45:08,560 --> 04:45:09,900
In between the trees?

5644
04:45:13,520 --> 04:45:14,860
In between the trees?

5645
04:45:16,500 --> 04:45:17,020
Doink.

5646
04:45:17,180 --> 04:45:17,700
Doink.

5647
04:45:17,700 --> 04:45:18,360
Here

5648
04:45:24,050 --> 04:45:25,150
we go.

5649
04:45:26,470 --> 04:45:28,650
I hope I don't get caught by the guy.

5650
04:45:29,010 --> 04:45:29,990
I'm going to get scared.

5651
04:45:42,860 --> 04:45:43,380
Okay.

5652
04:45:43,380 --> 04:45:44,160
Like that?

5653
04:45:44,460 --> 04:45:44,880
Wait.

5654
04:45:49,420 --> 04:45:50,860
Over a little bit more maybe.

5655
04:45:59,680 --> 04:46:01,060
It's so hard to see that one.

5656
04:46:03,820 --> 04:46:04,340
Yippee!

5657
04:46:04,340 --> 04:46:05,500
We made it!

5658
04:46:06,780 --> 04:46:08,500
We made it just in time!

5659
04:46:14,650 --> 04:46:16,810
No, I don't want to go back down there.

5660
04:46:16,910 --> 04:46:17,550
I'll be honest.

5661
04:46:17,690 --> 04:46:19,870
I'm too scared to go back down there.

5662
04:46:21,650 --> 04:46:23,370
I'll sprint past one guy.

5663
04:46:26,410 --> 04:46:26,930
Okay.

5664
04:47:10,840 --> 04:47:11,360
Okay.

5665
04:47:11,360 --> 04:47:12,640
We're back here.

5666
04:47:12,980 --> 04:47:14,600
I love the music in this part.

5667
04:47:14,700 --> 04:47:15,580
It's so epic.

5668
04:47:19,340 --> 04:47:21,280
I don't think we have a lot of time.

5669
04:47:21,560 --> 04:47:23,780
So, time is not of the essence.

5670
04:47:24,140 --> 04:47:26,000
We got to figure out what we're doing.

5671
04:47:26,140 --> 04:47:31,120
Which means I'm putting this sucker down like right here.

5672
04:47:31,540 --> 04:47:33,220
And I'm walking away.

5673
04:47:33,880 --> 04:47:36,540
And I'm going to go to this thing.

5674
04:47:36,980 --> 04:47:37,840
Over here.

5675
04:47:39,760 --> 04:47:40,320
Okay.

5676
04:47:44,120 --> 04:47:44,680
Open.

5677
04:47:45,320 --> 04:47:45,880
Oh.

5678
04:47:45,880 --> 04:47:46,540
Oh.

5679
04:47:47,100 --> 04:47:48,100
It's corrupted.

5680
04:47:49,200 --> 04:47:52,040
But maybe it won't be corrupted in the real world.

5681
04:47:56,220 --> 04:47:57,340
JK, get owned.

5682
04:47:58,380 --> 04:47:59,280
Hold on.

5683
04:48:03,130 --> 04:48:04,730
Maybe it's normal.

5684
04:48:05,550 --> 04:48:06,190
Here.

5685
04:48:06,550 --> 04:48:07,190
Oh.

5686
04:48:08,230 --> 04:48:09,050
It's not.

5687
04:48:12,690 --> 04:48:13,330
Okay.

5688
04:48:14,370 --> 04:48:15,470
What else can...

5689
04:48:15,470 --> 04:48:17,690
What else is weird in this world?

5690
04:48:20,670 --> 04:48:21,190
Just...

5691
04:48:31,100 --> 04:48:31,760
Oh, there's a code.

5692
04:48:33,160 --> 04:48:33,680
Yeah.

5693
04:48:34,660 --> 04:48:35,180
Oh.

5694
04:48:35,300 --> 04:48:36,560
It's because the lights.

5695
04:48:36,740 --> 04:48:37,180
Wait.

5696
04:48:39,040 --> 04:48:40,420
I have to put them in...

5697
04:48:40,420 --> 04:48:41,440
Into here, right?

5698
04:48:43,100 --> 04:48:43,620
Um...

5699
04:48:43,620 --> 04:48:43,960
Hmm.

5700
04:48:45,120 --> 04:48:46,040
Oh, that was it?

5701
04:48:46,880 --> 04:48:48,060
That's it for this place?

5702
04:48:48,140 --> 04:48:48,900
No way.

5703
04:48:52,040 --> 04:48:52,880
No way.

5704
04:48:57,290 --> 04:49:03,190
It was for a nonsense, useless code that didn't even exist?

5705
04:49:04,330 --> 04:49:06,330
What if I had discovered that on accident?

5706
04:49:06,530 --> 04:49:07,890
What if I had put the thing in and then...

5707
04:49:07,890 --> 04:49:08,730
Wow!

5708
04:49:11,390 --> 04:49:13,610
Whoa, it's that light over there.

5709
04:49:15,390 --> 04:49:16,710
Where are we?

5710
04:49:17,870 --> 04:49:19,890
Where are we in this video game world?

5711
04:49:33,540 --> 04:49:34,060
Ohio.

5712
04:49:34,940 --> 04:49:35,860
Very funny.

5713
04:49:40,410 --> 04:49:42,010
Now you know the shortcut better.

5714
04:49:42,210 --> 04:49:42,550
Yeah!

5715
04:49:43,830 --> 04:49:45,810
I mean, do I have to come back here?

5716
04:49:46,630 --> 04:49:49,870
Maybe eventually to figure out how to fix this, right?

5717
04:49:53,650 --> 04:49:54,690
It's all corrupted.

5718
04:49:56,490 --> 04:49:57,010
Okay.

5719
04:50:09,830 --> 04:50:11,570
I was just gonna wait for the...

5720
04:50:11,570 --> 04:50:13,090
There's also a screen over there.

5721
04:50:13,230 --> 04:50:15,410
So those are the other ones that we have to get, I'm assuming.

5722
04:50:21,670 --> 04:50:22,770
This is the...

5723
04:50:25,730 --> 04:50:26,530
This is...

5724
04:50:29,350 --> 04:50:30,090
The screen.

5725
04:50:30,230 --> 04:50:31,350
I think there's nothing else, right?

5726
04:50:36,860 --> 04:50:38,020
I think that's it.

5727
04:50:38,420 --> 04:50:38,820
Yeah.

5728
04:50:39,020 --> 04:50:41,360
I think we can wake up and...

5729
04:50:41,360 --> 04:50:43,620
Or I think we can just meditate until the next level.

5730
04:50:45,460 --> 04:50:45,880
Good.

5731
04:50:46,660 --> 04:50:47,800
Very good, everybody.

5732
04:50:48,880 --> 04:50:49,700
Good job.

5733
04:50:51,100 --> 04:50:52,040
Good job.

5734
04:50:52,340 --> 04:50:57,120
Why can't you see the scrolls or the slides in here, though?

5735
04:50:57,260 --> 04:50:58,220
How peculiar.

5736
04:51:05,600 --> 04:51:06,200
Huh?

5737
04:51:07,140 --> 04:51:07,740
Oh!

5738
04:51:08,180 --> 04:51:08,920
I like...

5739
04:51:08,920 --> 04:51:10,240
I like died-died.

5740
04:51:11,400 --> 04:51:12,700
I don't know how to swim.

5741
04:51:14,760 --> 04:51:15,620
That's interesting.

5742
04:51:17,360 --> 04:51:19,020
Two more locations to solve.

5743
04:51:19,140 --> 04:51:19,280
Yup.

5744
04:51:22,320 --> 04:51:25,220
One of them I'm really not looking forward to!

5745
04:51:26,860 --> 04:51:28,600
One of them I'm really...

5746
04:51:28,600 --> 04:51:29,500
Wait.

5747
04:51:32,340 --> 04:51:32,840
Huh?

5748
04:51:33,300 --> 04:51:35,040
Didn't I just meditate until the next one?

5749
04:51:40,370 --> 04:51:42,950
Yeah, I wasn't holding the fire, so I actually drowned, drowned.

5750
04:51:47,010 --> 04:51:47,510
Oh!

5751
04:51:47,790 --> 04:51:48,190
I...

5752
04:51:48,190 --> 04:51:48,790
That's right.

5753
04:51:48,790 --> 04:51:51,330
Alright, I meditated... close to the fire.

5754
04:51:51,930 --> 04:51:54,310
I remember, I remember, I remember.

5755
04:51:57,590 --> 04:51:59,810
I remember, I remember, I remember.

5756
04:52:09,440 --> 04:52:10,120
Okay.

5757
04:52:12,320 --> 04:52:13,200
Good loop, everybody.

5758
04:52:14,240 --> 04:52:15,200
I remember!

5759
04:52:15,620 --> 04:52:16,580
I remember.

5760
04:52:17,200 --> 04:52:18,200
I remember.

5761
04:52:21,220 --> 04:52:23,600
You got world-breaking knowledge now.

5762
04:52:23,600 --> 04:52:24,680
I know, you're right.

5763
04:52:25,400 --> 04:52:26,440
Okay, let's see.

5764
04:52:26,540 --> 04:52:27,820
If I go in here...

5765
04:52:28,520 --> 04:52:31,200
Not even the system knows what to tell...

5766
04:52:31,200 --> 04:52:31,680
It's like...

5767
04:52:31,680 --> 04:52:34,100
I don't even know what to tell you, man.

5768
04:52:34,920 --> 04:52:35,580
Oh, here.

5769
04:52:35,660 --> 04:52:39,540
There's a container marked with one of the Vault Seals, but its contents have been destroyed.

5770
04:52:40,420 --> 04:52:40,940
Yay!

5771
04:52:40,940 --> 04:52:42,560
We got it!

5772
04:52:44,160 --> 04:52:44,680
Okay.

5773
04:52:49,080 --> 04:52:50,380
Shrouded Woodlands is...

5774
04:52:54,060 --> 04:52:54,580
Uh...

5775
04:52:57,500 --> 04:52:58,620
The one with the boat.

5776
04:52:59,000 --> 04:52:59,520
Right?

5777
04:53:01,220 --> 04:53:03,040
How will people please fix...

5778
04:53:04,420 --> 04:53:05,640
The first one.

5779
04:53:05,800 --> 04:53:06,000
Okay.

5780
04:53:10,880 --> 04:53:11,400
Um...

5781
04:53:11,400 --> 04:53:12,880
And then this is the tower.

5782
04:53:20,120 --> 04:53:21,880
We still have the sealed vaults...

5783
04:53:23,480 --> 04:53:24,000
But...

5784
04:53:26,460 --> 04:53:28,520
We know so much more now...

5785
04:53:29,780 --> 04:53:30,660
Than before.

5786
04:53:35,930 --> 04:53:37,230
You have new knowledge.

5787
04:53:37,230 --> 04:53:38,690
Yeah, we have new knowledge.

5788
04:53:43,780 --> 04:53:44,820
In fact...

5789
04:53:45,220 --> 04:53:46,480
I'm thinking...

5790
04:53:46,480 --> 04:53:50,300
Well, I should probably go to these two first before I go...

5791
04:53:50,300 --> 04:53:51,280
I was gonna go to...

5792
04:53:51,280 --> 04:53:55,720
This submerged structure and sleep there and see what happens in the...

5793
04:53:55,720 --> 04:53:56,480
At the lake.

5794
04:53:58,000 --> 04:53:59,200
But I will...

5795
04:53:59,780 --> 04:54:00,300
Refrain...

5796
04:54:01,760 --> 04:54:02,700
Maybe for now?

5797
04:54:03,140 --> 04:54:05,040
Until we do these two other ones?

5798
04:54:05,600 --> 04:54:07,700
Or I could do that as a break?

5799
04:54:07,800 --> 04:54:08,440
Try it?

5800
04:54:09,320 --> 04:54:10,320
I was gonna say...

5801
04:54:10,320 --> 04:54:11,480
Maybe do it as a break...

5802
04:54:11,480 --> 04:54:12,040
From...

5803
04:54:12,040 --> 04:54:12,940
From these?

5804
04:54:13,060 --> 04:54:13,700
So that I'm...

5805
04:54:13,700 --> 04:54:14,160
Since I'm...

5806
04:54:14,160 --> 04:54:15,120
Since I'm scared...

5807
04:54:15,120 --> 04:54:15,820
Scaredy baby?

5808
04:54:16,940 --> 04:54:17,620
Look at this.

5809
04:54:17,700 --> 04:54:19,320
All started with a radio tower.

5810
04:54:21,000 --> 04:54:21,660
All right.

5811
04:54:21,760 --> 04:54:23,680
So let's go to the submerged structure.

5812
04:54:31,230 --> 04:54:31,930
I'm coming.

5813
04:54:37,080 --> 04:54:37,560
Okay.

5814
04:54:39,540 --> 04:54:40,020
Cool.

5815
04:54:40,420 --> 04:54:42,680
Is there any part of the game which doesn't scare you?

5816
04:54:42,700 --> 04:54:43,580
What are you talking about?

5817
04:54:46,860 --> 04:54:47,340
What?

5818
04:54:47,580 --> 04:54:48,060
What?

5819
04:54:53,650 --> 04:54:54,650
I'm scaredy baby.

5820
04:55:00,710 --> 04:55:01,830
I'm scaredy baby.

5821
04:55:02,010 --> 04:55:02,270
Please.

5822
04:55:02,350 --> 04:55:02,710
Understand.

5823
04:55:08,370 --> 04:55:09,170
Coming in hot.

5824
04:55:11,330 --> 04:55:12,070
Do a flip.

5825
04:55:24,730 --> 04:55:25,210
Okay.

5826
04:55:25,230 --> 04:55:25,470
Sorry.

5827
04:55:25,690 --> 04:55:25,890
Here.

5828
04:55:25,970 --> 04:55:26,090
Here.

5829
04:55:31,060 --> 04:55:32,020
I'm suckling.

5830
04:55:34,240 --> 04:55:35,580
Actually, I am kind of hungry.

5831
04:55:35,680 --> 04:55:35,860
Okay.

5832
04:55:37,720 --> 04:55:38,500
All right, everybody.

5833
04:55:38,660 --> 04:55:39,160
Teeth out.

5834
04:55:40,740 --> 04:55:41,380
I'm hungry.

5835
04:55:42,160 --> 04:55:42,480
Wait.

5836
04:55:43,860 --> 04:55:44,500
I'm hungry.

5837
04:55:49,590 --> 04:55:53,470
You know that person earlier that was just like, have you ever thought of Chad as your baby?

5838
04:55:53,610 --> 04:55:53,890
Oh, wait.

5839
04:55:53,950 --> 04:55:54,430
Let's get this.

5840
04:55:55,050 --> 04:55:55,370
Sorry.

5841
04:55:55,410 --> 04:55:56,370
I know I always get this one.

5842
04:55:56,430 --> 04:55:57,450
I just think it's really easy.

5843
04:55:57,530 --> 04:55:59,730
It's like so fast and easy to get to it.

5844
04:55:59,750 --> 04:56:01,650
Well, it would be if I didn't get the post.

5845
04:56:04,610 --> 04:56:05,250
This side.

5846
04:56:05,310 --> 04:56:05,530
This side.

5847
04:56:05,570 --> 04:56:05,770
This side.

5848
04:56:07,370 --> 04:56:08,570
You know how they were just like...

5849
04:56:08,570 --> 04:56:09,690
Do you think of Chad as your baby?

5850
04:56:09,850 --> 04:56:10,490
And I was like, no.

5851
04:56:11,070 --> 04:56:13,370
What if you thought me as your baby?

5852
04:56:14,610 --> 04:56:22,090
Would you treat me better if you were like, I gave birth to this ghost for death?

5853
04:56:23,470 --> 04:56:25,210
Kind of complicated, isn't it?

5854
04:56:27,450 --> 04:56:28,870
Are we allowed to?

5855
04:56:31,630 --> 04:56:35,590
I don't know.

5856
04:56:35,610 --> 04:56:37,050
Your name is the bravery duck.

5857
04:56:37,550 --> 04:56:38,810
Are you brave enough?

5858
04:56:43,130 --> 04:56:45,510
Why did you have to go and die so soon?

5859
04:56:50,530 --> 04:56:51,930
I'm not into baby play.

5860
04:56:55,350 --> 04:56:55,950
That's fine.

5861
04:56:56,550 --> 04:57:00,570
We'll go to Nile Perch and we'll all get new outfits together.

5862
04:57:02,570 --> 04:57:05,750
And if you don't know what Nile Perch is, just look it up and tell me.

5863
04:57:06,030 --> 04:57:06,830
It's like...

5864
04:57:08,730 --> 04:57:12,310
It's like the cutest brand ever, but I can never wear a single thing.

5865
04:57:12,410 --> 04:57:13,230
Actually, that's a lie.

5866
04:57:13,610 --> 04:57:15,570
I bought a beret from them once.

5867
04:57:15,990 --> 04:57:17,810
But everything else, I'm like, I can't.

5868
04:57:17,810 --> 04:57:18,250
I can't buy.

5869
04:57:18,390 --> 04:57:18,830
I just...

5870
04:57:18,830 --> 04:57:21,190
I just can't buy from this brand.

5871
04:57:21,790 --> 04:57:24,710
Because I would never be able to wear it at home ever.

5872
04:57:25,050 --> 04:57:28,870
You were doing a baby RP and I took a nap and I woke up and you were still doing a baby...

5873
04:57:28,870 --> 04:57:30,750
Why did you sleep during my stream?

5874
04:57:32,930 --> 04:57:34,390
You're not feeding the alligator.

5875
04:57:34,770 --> 04:57:35,490
Oh, wait.

5876
04:57:35,610 --> 04:57:38,190
We don't have to go to the right.

5877
04:57:38,230 --> 04:57:38,810
I just remembered.

5878
04:57:41,150 --> 04:57:42,030
Just remembered.

5879
04:57:42,170 --> 04:57:42,950
But you can go straight.

5880
04:57:46,430 --> 04:57:46,910
Don't...

5881
04:57:46,910 --> 04:57:48,830
Is this a clipper sleeping on the job?

5882
04:57:48,930 --> 04:57:50,310
Don't sleep during my stream.

5883
04:57:51,430 --> 04:57:53,530
Fine, I'll do ASMR or something.

5884
04:57:54,610 --> 04:57:55,850
God, is that what you want?

5885
04:57:56,330 --> 04:57:57,950
God, stop pulling my...

5886
04:57:58,790 --> 04:58:01,610
Gosh, you're really yanking my arm here with this...

5887
04:58:01,610 --> 04:58:03,470
Just like nonstop.

5888
04:58:03,690 --> 04:58:05,410
Do ASMR, Minto.

5889
04:58:06,350 --> 04:58:08,730
Actually, I think my ASMR...

5890
04:58:08,730 --> 04:58:12,150
I have an ASMR mic, but I think it needs to...

5891
04:58:12,150 --> 04:58:13,310
I think it needs new batteries.

5892
04:58:13,690 --> 04:58:15,470
I think I forgot to turn it off.

5893
04:58:22,470 --> 04:58:24,950
Niall, perch is apparently also just a straight up fish.

5894
04:58:25,150 --> 04:58:25,570
It is!

5895
04:58:26,650 --> 04:58:27,930
I had no idea.

5896
04:58:30,390 --> 04:58:32,210
Okay, to the submerged...

5897
04:58:33,170 --> 04:58:33,610
place.

5898
04:58:34,630 --> 04:58:35,950
We're gonna keep our boat here.

5899
04:58:37,010 --> 04:58:38,110
Please, please, please.

5900
04:58:39,610 --> 04:58:41,430
Please, please, please.

5901
04:58:42,250 --> 04:58:44,130
Da-da-da-da.

5902
04:58:45,370 --> 04:58:47,790
You guys know that Sabrina Carpenter song?

5903
04:58:48,030 --> 04:58:50,410
I've kind of been listening to it a lot.

5904
04:58:54,710 --> 04:58:56,470
Heartbreak is one thing.

5905
04:58:56,510 --> 04:58:58,130
My ego's another.

5906
04:58:59,630 --> 04:59:03,030
Don't ever something embarrass me.

5907
04:59:05,750 --> 04:59:07,190
She goes so low.

5908
04:59:07,930 --> 04:59:08,610
Motherfucker.

5909
04:59:09,430 --> 04:59:11,050
She goes so low there.

5910
04:59:12,950 --> 04:59:14,610
I was singing it earlier.

5911
04:59:15,290 --> 04:59:17,790
While I was getting ready for stream.

5912
04:59:18,050 --> 04:59:19,890
While I was thinking, how late should I be today?

5913
04:59:20,110 --> 04:59:21,090
I was singing it.

5914
04:59:28,460 --> 04:59:30,680
Pulling your locomotive limb.

5915
04:59:31,620 --> 04:59:32,540
What does that mean?

5916
04:59:35,500 --> 04:59:37,280
I've only heard her name like yesterday.

5917
04:59:37,420 --> 04:59:38,440
She's like the hot...

5918
04:59:38,440 --> 04:59:40,040
hotness right now, you know?

5919
04:59:41,060 --> 04:59:42,440
She's kind of the hotness.

5920
04:59:46,620 --> 04:59:47,800
I like her music.

5921
04:59:47,840 --> 04:59:48,480
I think it's cute.

5922
05:00:02,630 --> 05:00:03,150
Okay.

5923
05:00:05,950 --> 05:00:08,310
Let's leave our little buddy here.

5924
05:00:10,930 --> 05:00:11,750
Right here.

5925
05:00:14,210 --> 05:00:15,530
Towards the exit.

5926
05:00:16,170 --> 05:00:16,850
Thank you.

5927
05:00:22,610 --> 05:00:23,510
It's probably fine.

5928
05:00:23,750 --> 05:00:24,510
Oh, there we go.

5929
05:00:29,040 --> 05:00:30,000
Oh my god.

5930
05:00:35,570 --> 05:00:36,770
Oh, there they are!

5931
05:00:37,050 --> 05:00:41,910
And then there's a beam of light that comes down that makes us visible.

5932
05:00:44,010 --> 05:00:46,370
And there's also parkour!

5933
05:00:48,670 --> 05:00:50,830
Oh, the power thing just went out?

5934
05:00:52,710 --> 05:00:56,690
There's also a boat that goes directly here.

5935
05:01:01,080 --> 05:01:03,040
Oh my god, he's like half...

5936
05:01:07,040 --> 05:01:08,120
Can I see inside?

5937
05:01:09,180 --> 05:01:13,160
Yes, we've seen this already!

5938
05:01:13,440 --> 05:01:13,820
I'm bored!

5939
05:01:15,280 --> 05:01:15,800
Stop!

5940
05:01:15,960 --> 05:01:16,760
I've seen this already!

5941
05:01:20,200 --> 05:01:22,120
You can see the platforms, yeah.

5942
05:01:24,500 --> 05:01:25,600
Vision jump scare.

5943
05:01:26,980 --> 05:01:28,040
Walk out of it?

5944
05:01:28,580 --> 05:01:29,700
Oh, okay, thank you.

5945
05:01:35,700 --> 05:01:37,400
I still am not quite sure.

5946
05:01:37,520 --> 05:01:39,820
Unless I have a box, I don't really...

5947
05:01:39,820 --> 05:01:44,220
I'm not really quite sure what to do here.

5948
05:01:48,900 --> 05:01:51,060
I was hoping that maybe if I...

5949
05:01:51,940 --> 05:01:53,920
Wait, I see what I can do.

5950
05:01:54,080 --> 05:01:56,620
If I go along the railing...

5951
05:01:56,620 --> 05:01:57,640
Hold on.

5952
05:01:58,500 --> 05:01:59,980
Let's go get our thing.

5953
05:02:00,400 --> 05:02:02,360
I don't think I said that last stream too.

5954
05:02:02,440 --> 05:02:04,220
I was like, what if... Oh my god, leave me alone!

5955
05:02:04,280 --> 05:02:05,460
I don't care about your vision!

5956
05:02:06,980 --> 05:02:08,180
He's like, wait, wait, wait.

5957
05:02:08,340 --> 05:02:09,360
He's like a tech bro.

5958
05:02:13,860 --> 05:02:15,020
I was wondering.

5959
05:02:15,120 --> 05:02:16,620
I was like, I wonder if I...

5960
05:02:16,620 --> 05:02:20,000
Go along the railing, if that will work.

5961
05:02:42,460 --> 05:02:43,340
I'm crawling.

5962
05:02:43,760 --> 05:02:44,360
Oh.

5963
05:02:59,680 --> 05:03:00,280
Oh.

5964
05:03:02,580 --> 05:03:03,200
No worries?

5965
05:03:03,560 --> 05:03:04,640
No worries!

5966
05:03:05,520 --> 05:03:10,720
That means no worries for the rest of your day.

5967
05:03:10,720 --> 05:03:10,860
Oh.

5968
05:03:14,860 --> 05:03:16,080
It's a problem.

5969
05:03:16,400 --> 05:03:17,060
What if I drop?

5970
05:03:22,740 --> 05:03:24,400
That was a far drop.

5971
05:03:26,760 --> 05:03:28,040
You can't solve it yet.

5972
05:03:29,280 --> 05:03:30,320
Yeah, I don't think so.

5973
05:03:34,430 --> 05:03:35,330
Yeah, I don't think so.

5974
05:03:46,760 --> 05:03:47,780
What's wrong with me?

5975
05:03:53,080 --> 05:03:53,520
Okay.

5976
05:03:53,520 --> 05:03:54,700
We're gonna get out of here.

5977
05:03:57,980 --> 05:03:59,520
We have other places to be.

5978
05:04:00,600 --> 05:04:02,740
I think the dam is about to explode.

5979
05:04:08,500 --> 05:04:10,600
I think we should...

5980
05:04:12,520 --> 05:04:13,720
Go over here.

5981
05:04:16,420 --> 05:04:16,960
Towards.

5982
05:04:16,960 --> 05:04:17,340
Yes.

5983
05:04:17,920 --> 05:04:18,640
Right there.

5984
05:04:19,080 --> 05:04:19,620
Okay.

5985
05:04:21,000 --> 05:04:21,540
And...

5986
05:04:23,320 --> 05:04:23,860
Nice.

5987
05:04:24,800 --> 05:04:25,100
Okay.

5988
05:04:26,200 --> 05:04:26,740
Okay.

5989
05:04:26,740 --> 05:04:27,280
Okay.

5990
05:04:28,780 --> 05:04:29,320
Okay.

5991
05:04:29,460 --> 05:04:29,840
Okay.

5992
05:04:29,900 --> 05:04:30,140
Okay.

5993
05:04:32,120 --> 05:04:34,180
I feel kind of bad for them.

5994
05:04:34,340 --> 05:04:36,540
They were just so like, yeah, we hate it here.

5995
05:04:36,740 --> 05:04:37,360
We're just...

5996
05:04:38,080 --> 05:04:38,620
Like...

5997
05:04:39,220 --> 05:04:41,940
We're just gonna go to virtual world and...

5998
05:04:42,540 --> 05:04:43,600
Become VTubers.

5999
05:04:43,600 --> 05:04:44,120
For real.

6000
05:04:48,630 --> 05:04:50,610
I ask myself that question every day.

6001
05:04:50,770 --> 05:04:51,310
About yourself?

6002
05:04:52,170 --> 05:04:52,970
Or about me?

6003
05:04:59,390 --> 05:04:59,910
Oh.

6004
05:05:01,130 --> 05:05:01,650
Uh...

6005
05:05:02,250 --> 05:05:02,510
Guys?

6006
05:05:06,510 --> 05:05:07,750
I don't think we have much time.

6007
05:05:08,870 --> 05:05:09,390
Both.

6008
05:05:10,610 --> 05:05:11,710
Sadly about you.

6009
05:05:12,350 --> 05:05:13,250
What are you doing?

6010
05:05:13,390 --> 05:05:13,690
What are you...

6011
05:05:14,070 --> 05:05:15,870
What do you mean by this?

6012
05:05:17,190 --> 05:05:18,250
Why?

6013
05:05:18,630 --> 05:05:19,410
Why me?

6014
05:05:28,210 --> 05:05:29,630
Twenty-two.

6015
05:05:32,290 --> 05:05:33,730
Twenty-one.

6016
05:05:36,940 --> 05:05:38,000
Twenty.

6017
05:05:38,720 --> 05:05:40,380
We'll go to the tower.

6018
05:05:41,460 --> 05:05:41,990
Nineteen.

6019
05:05:45,820 --> 05:05:46,880
Eighteen.

6020
05:05:50,140 --> 05:05:50,670
Seventeen.

6021
05:05:54,460 --> 05:05:54,990
Sixteen.

6022
05:05:59,040 --> 05:06:00,140
Fifteen.

6023
05:06:03,640 --> 05:06:04,740
Fourteen.

6024
05:06:07,880 --> 05:06:08,980
Thirteen.

6025
05:06:11,680 --> 05:06:12,780
Twelve.

6026
05:06:14,920 --> 05:06:18,120
I don't think we're gonna make it though to...

6027
05:06:18,120 --> 05:06:20,420
The tower.

6028
05:06:20,600 --> 05:06:20,860
We'll see.

6029
05:06:21,120 --> 05:06:22,020
Ten.

6030
05:06:24,940 --> 05:06:26,040
Nine.

6031
05:06:26,460 --> 05:06:27,560
Ten.

6032
05:06:29,060 --> 05:06:30,080
Oh, maybe we will.

6033
05:06:30,200 --> 05:06:30,860
Thirty seconds left?

6034
05:06:31,000 --> 05:06:31,900
Oh, we might make it then.

6035
05:06:32,020 --> 05:06:32,320
Maybe.

6036
05:06:33,440 --> 05:06:34,180
Well, no.

6037
05:06:34,640 --> 05:06:35,340
Not thirty.

6038
05:06:36,720 --> 05:06:37,120
Maybe?

6039
05:06:37,360 --> 05:06:38,160
Actually, I can't tell.

6040
05:06:38,340 --> 05:06:39,220
Oh, we'll make it.

6041
05:06:39,320 --> 05:06:40,220
We'll definitely make it.

6042
05:06:45,740 --> 05:06:46,820
Five hours ago.

6043
05:06:47,060 --> 05:06:47,380
Wow.

6044
05:06:47,440 --> 05:06:49,200
It's already been five hours of streaming?

6045
05:06:49,560 --> 05:06:50,140
Holy cow.

6046
05:06:54,910 --> 05:06:56,170
Even I'm shocked by that.

6047
05:06:56,290 --> 05:06:56,650
No way.

6048
05:06:56,990 --> 05:06:57,810
What time is it?

6049
05:06:58,430 --> 05:06:59,050
Oh my gosh.

6050
05:06:59,050 --> 05:06:59,710
It's 8 p.m.

6051
05:06:59,750 --> 05:06:59,870
Oh my gosh.

6052
05:07:00,570 --> 05:07:01,210
What?

6053
05:07:02,350 --> 05:07:02,990
What?

6054
05:07:03,070 --> 05:07:03,410
Wowee.

6055
05:07:04,850 --> 05:07:05,490
Okay.

6056
05:07:08,110 --> 05:07:09,530
I don't care.

6057
05:07:09,590 --> 05:07:09,930
I sleep.

6058
05:07:22,900 --> 05:07:24,340
What was that?

6059
05:07:27,730 --> 05:07:29,370
What are you getting all upset for?

6060
05:07:29,810 --> 05:07:30,870
Unless he died.

6061
05:07:33,310 --> 05:07:37,880
That was pretty freaky.

6062
05:07:40,140 --> 05:07:40,780
Okay.

6063
05:07:40,780 --> 05:07:40,980
Okay.

6064
05:07:41,200 --> 05:07:41,620
Okay.

6065
05:07:43,360 --> 05:07:44,000
Okay.

6066
05:07:44,360 --> 05:07:45,000
Okay.

6067
05:07:46,660 --> 05:07:47,060
So...

6068
05:07:47,060 --> 05:07:47,940
Oh, wait.

6069
05:07:48,120 --> 05:07:48,440
Okay.

6070
05:07:48,540 --> 05:07:48,840
Wait.

6071
05:07:48,900 --> 05:07:52,520
I just wanted to see what this looked like because I knew that we weren't going to have a lot of time.

6072
05:07:54,000 --> 05:07:55,700
But I did want to see what this looked like.

6073
05:07:56,040 --> 05:07:56,360
Um...

6074
05:07:57,940 --> 05:07:59,060
Why are we still walking around?

6075
05:08:01,180 --> 05:08:01,580
Um...

6076
05:08:01,580 --> 05:08:02,160
I...

6077
05:08:02,160 --> 05:08:02,400
Okay.

6078
05:08:02,540 --> 05:08:03,280
What was it?

6079
05:08:04,380 --> 05:08:05,580
We go down here.

6080
05:08:07,160 --> 05:08:08,220
We go down here.

6081
05:08:09,800 --> 05:08:11,360
Then we go halfway.

6082
05:08:12,100 --> 05:08:13,300
Then we blow it out.

6083
05:08:14,460 --> 05:08:16,500
But I'm trying to see if there's any, um...

6084
05:08:17,780 --> 05:08:19,180
Any shortcuts we can do.

6085
05:08:20,440 --> 05:08:20,820
Once...

6086
05:08:20,820 --> 05:08:21,760
Because they're going to be...

6087
05:08:21,760 --> 05:08:23,880
You guys are going to be walking around once we...

6088
05:08:24,300 --> 05:08:25,660
Oh, I thought that was him.

6089
05:08:25,740 --> 05:08:26,860
I was like, he's a spider.

6090
05:08:28,340 --> 05:08:29,540
Oh, there he is.

6091
05:08:29,600 --> 05:08:30,120
Oh my gosh.

6092
05:08:30,660 --> 05:08:31,480
It's kind of crazy.

6093
05:08:32,600 --> 05:08:32,980
Um...

6094
05:08:35,200 --> 05:08:41,420
They're going to be walking around and I don't quite see how we get down here.

6095
05:08:41,460 --> 05:08:42,020
Oh, wait.

6096
05:08:42,020 --> 05:08:42,280
Okay.

6097
05:08:43,340 --> 05:08:44,000
Hold on.

6098
05:08:44,040 --> 05:08:44,300
Hold on.

6099
05:08:44,340 --> 05:08:44,540
I see.

6100
05:08:44,620 --> 05:08:44,860
I see.

6101
05:08:45,620 --> 05:08:47,380
So now we're figuring this out.

6102
05:08:47,520 --> 05:08:48,880
Because we go this way.

6103
05:08:52,480 --> 05:08:53,360
We go...

6104
05:08:54,360 --> 05:08:54,800
Down.

6105
05:08:55,080 --> 05:08:55,860
And then around.

6106
05:08:56,900 --> 05:08:57,660
And then...

6107
05:08:57,660 --> 05:08:58,300
Through.

6108
05:09:00,400 --> 05:09:00,840
Okay.

6109
05:09:00,920 --> 05:09:01,160
Okay.

6110
05:09:01,220 --> 05:09:01,400
Okay.

6111
05:09:01,420 --> 05:09:02,160
There's the other guy.

6112
05:09:02,380 --> 05:09:03,140
You can see him up there.

6113
05:09:04,440 --> 05:09:04,880
Okay.

6114
05:09:04,960 --> 05:09:05,200
See?

6115
05:09:05,320 --> 05:09:06,240
This was helpful.

6116
05:09:08,440 --> 05:09:10,640
Did you ever check the other door on the left?

6117
05:09:11,560 --> 05:09:12,000
Okay.

6118
05:09:12,740 --> 05:09:13,520
I wonder...

6119
05:09:13,520 --> 05:09:14,340
Actually, is it a shortcut?

6120
05:09:16,440 --> 05:09:16,980
Let's see.

6121
05:09:19,000 --> 05:09:21,940
I don't know where these guys are going to be wandering around.

6122
05:09:22,760 --> 05:09:23,880
It's an issue for me.

6123
05:09:28,640 --> 05:09:29,660
This door over here.

6124
05:09:31,160 --> 05:09:32,800
I can't remember if I did or not.

6125
05:09:43,030 --> 05:09:43,870
Maybe that's easier.

6126
05:09:44,110 --> 05:09:44,550
Hold on.

6127
05:09:44,550 --> 05:09:45,430
We can go check right now.

6128
05:09:47,830 --> 05:09:48,970
We can go check right now.

6129
05:09:52,110 --> 05:09:52,510
Void.

6130
05:09:58,880 --> 05:10:05,460
But if we're coming from the boat, it's hard to say which one will be easier.

6131
05:10:05,800 --> 05:10:06,400
You know?

6132
05:10:21,250 --> 05:10:21,770
Yeah.

6133
05:10:21,810 --> 05:10:22,630
So there's the elevator.

6134
05:10:23,530 --> 05:10:25,590
So we'll be coming from that end over there.

6135
05:10:28,690 --> 05:10:29,210
Yeah.

6136
05:10:30,830 --> 05:10:34,670
We'll be coming from over here.

6137
05:10:34,750 --> 05:10:35,270
Over there.

6138
05:10:36,870 --> 05:10:37,390
So...

6139
05:10:38,890 --> 05:10:39,410
Hmm.

6140
05:10:39,590 --> 05:10:39,930
Okay.

6141
05:10:41,850 --> 05:10:44,630
So I'm just going to make this blocky and then I'm just going to go downstairs and see what happens.

6142
05:10:45,690 --> 05:10:47,910
This is just getting us...

6143
05:10:48,850 --> 05:10:49,370
Oh,

6144
05:10:53,280 --> 05:10:56,700
I thought it was the music of...

6145
05:10:58,180 --> 05:10:59,220
Music of...

6146
05:10:59,220 --> 05:11:00,400
You're done.

6147
05:11:06,920 --> 05:11:08,900
I'm just getting a feel of the area.

6148
05:11:11,520 --> 05:11:12,040
Okay.

6149
05:11:12,040 --> 05:11:12,940
So down here.

6150
05:11:14,320 --> 05:11:15,600
I can go through here?

6151
05:11:15,700 --> 05:11:15,840
I can go through here?

6152
05:11:17,380 --> 05:11:18,720
Is anyone around here?

6153
05:11:18,800 --> 05:11:19,200
I'm scared.

6154
05:11:20,420 --> 05:11:21,160
Oh no!

6155
05:11:21,260 --> 05:11:24,000
There's a loop down here, which means somebody was gonna be down here!

6156
05:11:24,900 --> 05:11:25,700
There's a loop!

6157
05:11:25,760 --> 05:11:26,200
There's a loop!

6158
05:11:29,600 --> 05:11:30,080
God...

6159
05:11:41,260 --> 05:11:41,740
Okay.

6160
05:11:43,020 --> 05:11:44,140
Well now we know.

6161
05:11:46,400 --> 05:11:48,800
What is their vision like though?

6162
05:11:49,020 --> 05:11:49,320
You know?

6163
05:11:53,660 --> 05:11:54,140
Okay.

6164
05:11:54,140 --> 05:11:56,240
Alright, so we take the boat.

6165
05:11:56,560 --> 05:11:57,600
We blow it out.

6166
05:11:57,740 --> 05:12:01,240
Now that I know how this works...

6167
05:12:02,000 --> 05:12:04,300
What is a way that I can avoid...

6168
05:12:08,560 --> 05:12:10,500
avoid having to do this...

6169
05:12:11,720 --> 05:12:13,960
in the manner that must be done?

6170
05:12:15,600 --> 05:12:16,440
You know what I mean?

6171
05:12:18,620 --> 05:12:22,060
How can I... How can I big brain this?

6172
05:12:22,180 --> 05:12:23,080
Just like the other one.

6173
05:12:31,420 --> 05:12:32,740
You turn off the game.

6174
05:12:36,580 --> 05:12:39,780
The DLC got redesigned to make it easier to bypass the aliens.

6175
05:12:39,940 --> 05:12:40,440
Oh really?

6176
05:12:42,300 --> 05:12:43,620
You won't cheese this one?

6177
05:12:46,000 --> 05:12:46,480
Alrighty.

6178
05:12:49,680 --> 05:12:51,080
Well we know what we must do.

6179
05:12:52,280 --> 05:12:53,760
We go to the other side.

6180
05:12:55,240 --> 05:12:56,360
We uh...

6181
05:12:57,740 --> 05:12:59,460
We blow out the...

6182
05:12:59,460 --> 05:13:00,680
We blow out these lights.

6183
05:13:01,000 --> 05:13:02,180
We come back.

6184
05:13:03,820 --> 05:13:04,940
And attempt...

6185
05:13:04,940 --> 05:13:06,040
to go around.

6186
05:13:07,940 --> 05:13:08,860
I'm just gonna...

6187
05:13:08,860 --> 05:13:10,680
Trust your instincts as a soldier.

6188
05:13:10,980 --> 05:13:11,980
As a gamer!

6189
05:13:13,500 --> 05:13:15,300
I played the old design of the DLC.

6190
05:13:15,380 --> 05:13:15,820
It was hell.

6191
05:13:15,880 --> 05:13:16,160
Really?

6192
05:13:18,000 --> 05:13:19,600
So, actually I'm curious.

6193
05:13:19,800 --> 05:13:20,900
Now that we know...

6194
05:13:20,900 --> 05:13:22,200
Now that I know...

6195
05:13:22,900 --> 05:13:24,720
About what's going on...

6196
05:13:24,720 --> 05:13:26,640
If I turn on baby mode...

6197
05:13:26,640 --> 05:13:27,540
What does it change?

6198
05:13:38,770 --> 05:13:40,390
The enemies move slower...

6199
05:13:40,390 --> 05:13:41,090
when chasing you.

6200
05:13:42,170 --> 05:13:43,990
They chase you slower.

6201
05:13:49,950 --> 05:13:50,870
Dumber AI.

6202
05:13:51,210 --> 05:13:52,250
Still just as spoopy.

6203
05:13:52,730 --> 05:13:53,330
See?

6204
05:13:53,470 --> 05:13:54,370
That's not that bad.

6205
05:13:54,750 --> 05:13:56,970
I figured they'd be chasing after me.

6206
05:13:56,970 --> 05:13:58,910
So I feel like that wasn't even really a spoiler.

6207
05:14:01,130 --> 05:14:02,350
Did I get anything new?

6208
05:14:02,650 --> 05:14:02,850
Did I get anything new?

6209
05:14:02,850 --> 05:14:02,870
Oh!

6210
05:14:04,150 --> 05:14:08,230
The wall at the bottom of the village is guarded by a statue that activates an alarm bell when it sees me.

6211
05:14:09,330 --> 05:14:10,130
Astute observation.

6212
05:14:10,690 --> 05:14:11,150
Thank you.

6213
05:14:23,300 --> 05:14:26,560
As long as I'm faster than them, all I have to do is run, right?

6214
05:14:29,220 --> 05:14:31,360
As long as I'm faster than them, all I have to do is run, right?

6215
05:14:31,360 --> 05:14:31,580
As long as I'm faster than them, I just...

6216
05:14:31,580 --> 05:14:32,860
I just book it, right?

6217
05:14:33,120 --> 05:14:33,180
I just book it, right?

6218
05:14:36,360 --> 05:14:36,840
Okay.

6219
05:14:37,400 --> 05:14:38,480
Here we go!

6220
05:14:40,200 --> 05:14:41,480
To the tower!

6221
05:14:41,620 --> 05:14:42,100
To the tower!

6222
05:14:42,180 --> 05:14:42,600
To the tower!

6223
05:14:42,660 --> 05:14:43,100
To the tower!

6224
05:14:55,010 --> 05:14:55,490
Hello!

6225
05:14:55,930 --> 05:14:56,730
Coming in hot!

6226
05:14:56,830 --> 05:14:57,650
Coming in hot!

6227
05:14:57,790 --> 05:14:58,610
Coming in hot!

6228
05:15:00,430 --> 05:15:01,530
Do a flip!

6229
05:15:02,990 --> 05:15:04,150
And we're good!

6230
05:15:05,850 --> 05:15:06,990
It's just a glass.

6231
05:15:07,930 --> 05:15:08,970
It's just a glass.

6232
05:15:09,150 --> 05:15:10,750
We're never coming back here ever again anyway.

6233
05:15:11,110 --> 05:15:11,990
Goodbye ship!

6234
05:15:12,810 --> 05:15:13,610
Goodbye ship!

6235
05:15:14,570 --> 05:15:15,330
Goodbye!

6236
05:15:15,810 --> 05:15:16,210
Goodbye!

6237
05:15:16,850 --> 05:15:17,250
Goodbye!

6238
05:15:17,830 --> 05:15:18,290
Goodbye!

6239
05:15:19,450 --> 05:15:20,710
Goodbye world!

6240
05:15:20,890 --> 05:15:21,150
Goodbye!

6241
05:15:22,830 --> 05:15:23,590
Goodbye!

6242
05:15:23,950 --> 05:15:24,310
Goodbye!

6243
05:15:24,510 --> 05:15:24,690
Goodbye!

6244
05:15:25,050 --> 05:15:26,170
Everybody say goodbye to the ship.

6245
05:15:26,390 --> 05:15:27,710
Say goodbye ship!

6246
05:15:30,950 --> 05:15:32,690
I hardly knew ye!

6247
05:15:35,550 --> 05:15:36,310
Okay...

6248
05:15:36,310 --> 05:15:36,430
Okay...

6249
05:15:38,150 --> 05:15:38,670
Oh.

6250
05:15:49,240 --> 05:15:50,780
And let's get our artifact!

6251
05:15:59,350 --> 05:16:01,010
I never liked that ship anyway.

6252
05:16:01,290 --> 05:16:01,710
What?

6253
05:16:01,870 --> 05:16:03,250
What did this ship do to you?

6254
05:16:04,270 --> 05:16:04,790
What?

6255
05:16:04,790 --> 05:16:05,310
What did this ship do to you?

6256
05:16:11,780 --> 05:16:13,480
So after I do...

6257
05:16:14,020 --> 05:16:15,300
I mean, this seems like pretty...

6258
05:16:15,300 --> 05:16:17,680
Pretty big puzzles.

6259
05:16:17,840 --> 05:16:18,960
After these...

6260
05:16:19,980 --> 05:16:22,720
I'm guessing I have to figure out a way to...

6261
05:16:22,720 --> 05:16:22,900
I'm guessing I have to figure out a way to...

6262
05:16:25,020 --> 05:16:25,540
Unscramble...

6263
05:16:25,540 --> 05:16:26,500
Unscramble...

6264
05:16:26,500 --> 05:16:26,880
The code.

6265
05:16:27,560 --> 05:16:29,120
So then we can unlock it.

6266
05:16:32,460 --> 05:16:34,560
Every time I'm just like, I don't know what else...

6267
05:16:35,300 --> 05:16:36,680
I have to do in this game.

6268
05:16:36,820 --> 05:16:37,980
It always surprises me.

6269
05:16:40,680 --> 05:16:42,040
Ship during base game.

6270
05:16:42,380 --> 05:16:43,600
Oh my precious baby!

6271
05:16:43,800 --> 05:16:44,480
Ship during DLC.

6272
05:16:44,600 --> 05:16:45,460
Smell you later stinky!

6273
05:16:48,260 --> 05:16:50,720
That's because I needed my precious baby before.

6274
05:16:51,700 --> 05:16:52,180
Now...

6275
05:16:52,180 --> 05:16:54,360
He just gets me to this place.

6276
05:16:54,440 --> 05:16:55,840
And now it's all about boats.

6277
05:16:56,660 --> 05:16:57,980
It's all about boat baby!

6278
05:17:01,840 --> 05:17:03,180
Ain't that part of the fun.

6279
05:17:04,880 --> 05:17:05,680
So true.

6280
05:17:12,410 --> 05:17:12,890
Alrighty.

6281
05:17:14,430 --> 05:17:14,910
Okay.

6282
05:17:15,610 --> 05:17:16,090
Alrighty.

6283
05:17:23,140 --> 05:17:24,240
I'll be honest though.

6284
05:17:24,300 --> 05:17:25,680
Do you guys think I'm gonna finish today?

6285
05:17:27,300 --> 05:17:27,520
Another...

6286
05:17:27,520 --> 05:17:28,780
How long has it been?

6287
05:17:30,580 --> 05:17:31,220
One second.

6288
05:17:31,760 --> 05:17:33,480
Oh I can exit out of all these paint.

6289
05:17:34,260 --> 05:17:34,980
Windows now?

6290
05:17:37,680 --> 05:17:38,120
Mmm...

6291
05:17:41,640 --> 05:17:42,080
Mmm...

6292
05:17:43,640 --> 05:17:44,540
Get rid of you.

6293
05:17:45,740 --> 05:17:46,440
Oh sorry.

6294
05:17:47,020 --> 05:17:48,560
It keeps like auto...

6295
05:17:49,180 --> 05:17:50,940
Auto returning to the game.

6296
05:17:51,180 --> 05:17:52,000
Oh I just...

6297
05:17:52,000 --> 05:17:54,360
Oh shoot I just exited out of one of the codes.

6298
05:17:54,460 --> 05:17:55,120
But it should be okay.

6299
05:17:55,860 --> 05:17:56,300
Okay.

6300
05:17:57,300 --> 05:17:57,320
That works.

6301
05:18:01,750 --> 05:18:03,210
You are in the latter half.

6302
05:18:03,510 --> 05:18:03,910
Awesome!

6303
05:18:05,690 --> 05:18:07,470
But it depends... possible but it depends.

6304
05:18:07,790 --> 05:18:08,090
Alright.

6305
05:18:08,590 --> 05:18:10,430
Guys we're just gonna big brain everything.

6306
05:18:10,590 --> 05:18:10,790
Okay?

6307
05:18:14,070 --> 05:18:15,430
We're gonna big brain everything.

6308
05:18:20,570 --> 05:18:22,270
You can finish in one hour?

6309
05:18:22,330 --> 05:18:23,290
Brain think good?

6310
05:18:24,550 --> 05:18:25,430
No way.

6311
05:18:29,660 --> 05:18:30,220
Brain...

6312
05:18:30,800 --> 05:18:31,360
Um...

6313
05:18:31,360 --> 05:18:32,400
Might need a break.

6314
05:18:34,280 --> 05:18:34,440
Food.

6315
05:18:36,280 --> 05:18:37,080
Actually okay.

6316
05:18:37,680 --> 05:18:39,380
Is there... now that I think about it.

6317
05:18:39,440 --> 05:18:40,800
Is there anything I need to do here?

6318
05:18:41,500 --> 05:18:42,080
Hold on.

6319
05:18:42,120 --> 05:18:42,560
I'm thinking.

6320
05:18:42,700 --> 05:18:43,960
Is there anything I need to do here?

6321
05:18:45,160 --> 05:18:45,560
Um...

6322
05:18:47,180 --> 05:18:48,840
To make things easier for me.

6323
05:18:48,920 --> 05:18:49,600
No the...

6324
05:18:49,600 --> 05:18:51,240
Elevator was up.

6325
05:18:57,100 --> 05:18:57,500
Mmm...

6326
05:18:58,980 --> 05:18:59,780
I think

6327
05:19:03,260 --> 05:19:03,620
we're...

6328
05:19:03,620 --> 05:19:04,780
I think it's not like before.

6329
05:19:07,140 --> 05:19:08,440
I don't think it's like before.

6330
05:19:10,060 --> 05:19:11,820
I think we can just go...

6331
05:19:11,820 --> 05:19:13,660
If not then...

6332
05:19:13,660 --> 05:19:15,280
I guess uh...

6333
05:19:16,060 --> 05:19:16,700
FML...

6334
05:19:17,280 --> 05:19:17,600
Um...

6335
05:19:18,520 --> 05:19:20,480
Well really F-M-A-L.

6336
05:19:21,560 --> 05:19:22,840
And then...

6337
05:19:23,520 --> 05:19:24,160
Um...

6338
05:19:24,160 --> 05:19:26,040
I'm really scared of...

6339
05:19:26,040 --> 05:19:29,100
I'm really scared because before I was like I can just chase her.

6340
05:19:29,140 --> 05:19:29,540
It's great!

6341
05:19:30,120 --> 05:19:32,440
Now I know I cannot.

6342
05:19:33,800 --> 05:19:34,440
But...

6343
05:19:39,360 --> 05:19:40,300
Conceal.

6344
05:19:42,140 --> 05:19:42,800
And walk.

6345
05:19:44,560 --> 05:19:46,460
And that's the thing that sees me.

6346
05:19:47,400 --> 05:19:48,440
So now I'm good.

6347
05:19:52,240 --> 05:19:53,700
And here we go.

6348
05:19:54,240 --> 05:19:55,780
About half way through.

6349
05:19:58,880 --> 05:19:59,840
Where are you?

6350
05:20:00,060 --> 05:20:00,820
There it is.

6351
05:20:11,320 --> 05:20:11,920
Elevator.

6352
05:20:12,900 --> 05:20:13,500
Downwards?

6353
05:20:13,700 --> 05:20:14,120
Upwards?

6354
05:20:14,640 --> 05:20:15,240
Upwards.

6355
05:20:26,210 --> 05:20:27,010
Oh nice.

6356
05:20:27,010 --> 05:20:27,190
Nice.

6357
05:20:33,760 --> 05:20:34,900
Wait what's over here?

6358
05:20:37,540 --> 05:20:38,880
Hold on a second.

6359
05:20:39,720 --> 05:20:41,460
They didn't show me this in the visions.

6360
05:20:42,140 --> 05:20:42,580
Oh!

6361
05:20:42,780 --> 05:20:43,780
Wait, wait, wait.

6362
05:20:45,320 --> 05:20:46,520
Where does it take me?

6363
05:20:46,680 --> 05:20:46,960
Oh!

6364
05:20:47,160 --> 05:20:51,200
Look at them!

6365
05:20:54,760 --> 05:20:56,280
I took a nap and woke up.

6366
05:20:56,340 --> 05:20:57,660
Why are you all taking naps?

6367
05:21:00,240 --> 05:21:00,680
Um...

6368
05:21:03,300 --> 05:21:03,960
What was I gonna say?

6369
05:21:04,360 --> 05:21:07,060
Yeah, it said endurance in the title so...

6370
05:21:07,060 --> 05:21:08,540
I really am planning...

6371
05:21:08,540 --> 05:21:10,140
I'm really wanting to finish the game today.

6372
05:21:11,800 --> 05:21:12,320
Okay.

6373
05:21:12,820 --> 05:21:14,320
We just lost the electricity.

6374
05:21:14,880 --> 05:21:18,960
Also I noticed that sometimes my controller rumbles and sometimes it doesn't so...

6375
05:21:18,960 --> 05:21:20,780
In some places we're closer.

6376
05:21:22,160 --> 05:21:22,680
Oh!

6377
05:21:22,700 --> 05:21:23,380
Nope, never mind.

6378
05:21:23,500 --> 05:21:24,060
There's the rumble.

6379
05:21:25,860 --> 05:21:26,560
Let's see.

6380
05:21:26,840 --> 05:21:27,300
What?

6381
05:21:35,560 --> 05:21:36,600
I wonder...

6382
05:21:37,560 --> 05:21:39,180
If I can like jump from here.

6383
05:21:40,200 --> 05:21:40,920
And then...

6384
05:21:40,920 --> 05:21:42,180
Run over to the elevator.

6385
05:21:42,420 --> 05:21:43,700
I think that will be our best bet.

6386
05:21:44,640 --> 05:21:45,200
I think.

6387
05:21:49,520 --> 05:21:50,580
We'll just need to cook.

6388
05:21:51,340 --> 05:21:51,740
Okay.

6389
05:21:51,800 --> 05:21:52,540
Well you know what?

6390
05:21:52,580 --> 05:21:53,760
We have so many kitchen...

6391
05:21:53,760 --> 05:21:56,900
So many cooks in the kitchen, right?

6392
05:21:57,560 --> 05:21:59,700
We have so many cooks in the kitchen, I think we'll be good!

6393
05:22:04,350 --> 05:22:05,950
You weren't even watching TV.

6394
05:22:06,030 --> 05:22:06,770
Why do you care?

6395
05:22:12,180 --> 05:22:12,540
Oh.

6396
05:22:13,180 --> 05:22:13,880
There you go.

6397
05:22:14,000 --> 05:22:14,320
Wait.

6398
05:22:14,580 --> 05:22:15,040
What the?

6399
05:22:15,420 --> 05:22:16,400
Oh they're coming down.

6400
05:22:21,880 --> 05:22:22,240
Fento.

6401
05:22:22,340 --> 05:22:23,100
Thanks for the gift.

6402
05:22:36,080 --> 05:22:37,480
Wait, are they just taking the...

6403
05:22:37,480 --> 05:22:38,820
Elevator up and down and up and down?

6404
05:22:42,060 --> 05:22:42,560
Oh no.

6405
05:22:42,700 --> 05:22:43,600
I think they went down.

6406
05:22:45,420 --> 05:22:45,780
Oh?

6407
05:22:55,580 --> 05:22:55,940
Wow.

6408
05:22:56,460 --> 05:22:57,080
Very cool.

6409
05:23:00,740 --> 05:23:01,100
Oh!

6410
05:23:13,020 --> 05:23:14,100
Oh no!

6411
05:23:23,000 --> 05:23:23,540
Actually...

6412
05:23:23,540 --> 05:23:25,720
I wonder if this works even better.

6413
05:23:26,680 --> 05:23:27,220
Because...

6414
05:23:27,220 --> 05:23:29,300
We can take that shortcut on the left, right?

6415
05:23:32,890 --> 05:23:35,030
Why is he able to turn his light on?

6416
05:23:39,050 --> 05:23:41,350
Why can't he have his light on all the time?

6417
05:23:44,610 --> 05:23:46,190
I also can't hear them walking.

6418
05:23:46,510 --> 05:23:48,110
Before they were like so thumpy.

6419
05:23:50,410 --> 05:23:51,850
But now it's actually very...

6420
05:23:54,190 --> 05:23:54,630
Hard.

6421
05:23:57,820 --> 05:23:59,360
To hear them walking around.

6422
05:24:13,160 --> 05:24:14,320
Do you think he's in here?

6423
05:24:15,340 --> 05:24:15,980
I think he's in here.

6424
05:25:11,020 --> 05:25:11,640
I'm so...

6425
05:25:11,640 --> 05:25:12,100
I don't know.

6426
05:25:12,240 --> 05:25:14,380
I don't want to fall in the water.

6427
05:25:16,280 --> 05:25:16,660
Okay.

6428
05:25:17,080 --> 05:25:17,660
This way.

6429
05:25:19,080 --> 05:25:19,960
It's so dark.

6430
05:25:41,740 --> 05:25:42,920
I think I hear footsteps.

6431
05:25:51,070 --> 05:25:52,590
I'm scared to turn off my light.

6432
05:25:54,470 --> 05:25:56,710
I'm actually so scared to turn off my light, you guys.

6433
05:25:57,550 --> 05:25:58,450
Do you think it's okay?

6434
05:25:58,850 --> 05:25:59,630
Do you think it's okay?

6435
05:25:59,710 --> 05:26:00,250
Do you think it's okay?

6436
05:26:04,670 --> 05:26:05,590
I can hear...

6437
05:26:05,590 --> 05:26:06,390
I didn't see nothing.

6438
05:26:09,370 --> 05:26:10,390
Is that better for you?

6439
05:26:16,410 --> 05:26:16,770
Okay.

6440
05:26:16,850 --> 05:26:17,950
I'm gonna turn off the light.

6441
05:26:19,030 --> 05:26:19,390
Oh.

6442
05:26:32,160 --> 05:26:32,700
What's happening?

6443
05:26:36,080 --> 05:26:36,840
What's this music?

6444
05:26:39,220 --> 05:26:39,900
What is this?

6445
05:26:51,610 --> 05:26:52,470
What is this sound?

6446
05:26:52,550 --> 05:26:53,110
What is that noise?

6447
05:27:07,040 --> 05:27:08,200
He was right in front of me.

6448
05:27:12,360 --> 05:27:13,640
He was right in front of me.

6449
05:27:13,740 --> 05:27:13,760
He was right in front of me.

6450
05:27:13,760 --> 05:27:13,800
No!

6451
05:27:15,440 --> 05:27:15,960
You!

6452
05:27:18,680 --> 05:27:20,560
Why don't you want me here?

6453
05:27:23,960 --> 05:27:25,620
So that's what that music was.

6454
05:27:25,760 --> 05:27:26,440
Yeah, clearly.

6455
05:27:33,880 --> 05:27:35,460
That's the dam breaking.

6456
05:27:35,460 --> 05:27:35,540
That's the dam breaking.

6457
05:27:46,920 --> 05:27:48,640
I think the guy...

6458
05:27:54,150 --> 05:27:55,230
is downstairs.

6459
05:27:56,890 --> 05:27:58,090
Legit jump scare.

6460
05:27:58,350 --> 05:27:59,270
I know, right?

6461
05:28:09,740 --> 05:28:10,340
Okay.

6462
05:28:10,960 --> 05:28:11,560
Alright.

6463
05:28:12,060 --> 05:28:13,120
Let's do this again.

6464
05:28:18,080 --> 05:28:19,180
Let's do this again.

6465
05:28:20,520 --> 05:28:20,960
Hmm.

6466
05:28:26,850 --> 05:28:28,570
Will they see if I focus light?

6467
05:28:33,510 --> 05:28:35,490
Has she found out what that noise is?

6468
05:28:35,550 --> 05:28:35,970
I have not.

6469
05:28:39,950 --> 05:28:40,390
What?

6470
05:28:41,010 --> 05:28:41,450
What?

6471
05:28:42,370 --> 05:28:43,290
Wait, did I...

6472
05:28:43,290 --> 05:28:46,310
Did I go in the water or did I get caught?

6473
05:28:46,570 --> 05:28:48,370
I guess I got... I guess I went in the water.

6474
05:28:48,830 --> 05:28:49,950
Oh my god.

6475
05:28:53,810 --> 05:28:54,570
Oh my god.

6476
05:28:55,430 --> 05:28:55,810
Gosh.

6477
05:28:57,810 --> 05:28:59,750
Luckily it's easy enough to get over there.

6478
05:29:02,650 --> 05:29:04,670
You guys say I need to use my brain.

6479
05:29:04,830 --> 05:29:05,710
Well, it's really just...

6480
05:29:05,710 --> 05:29:06,170
I need to...

6481
05:29:07,290 --> 05:29:09,150
I need to get this to work.

6482
05:29:09,330 --> 05:29:10,230
I need to get over there.

6483
05:29:13,880 --> 05:29:14,740
I'm just gonna walk.

6484
05:29:15,120 --> 05:29:16,280
If I get caught...

6485
05:29:16,280 --> 05:29:16,900
Have they seen me?

6486
05:29:19,180 --> 05:29:20,200
We only have...

6487
05:29:20,200 --> 05:29:21,140
We only have...

6488
05:29:21,140 --> 05:29:22,860
We're living on borrowed time.

6489
05:29:24,120 --> 05:29:26,300
I think he's all the way on the other side.

6490
05:29:27,040 --> 05:29:29,740
I think he's all the way on the other side.

6491
05:29:32,720 --> 05:29:34,280
Set down the lantern.

6492
05:29:44,000 --> 05:29:45,700
Trying not to fall in the water.

6493
05:29:47,280 --> 05:29:48,940
I think I'm in front of a rock.

6494
05:29:52,100 --> 05:29:52,800
Don't fall.

6495
05:29:52,920 --> 05:29:53,280
Don't fall.

6496
05:29:55,720 --> 05:29:56,200
Um...

6497
05:30:07,500 --> 05:30:08,700
Oh my god.

6498
05:30:08,920 --> 05:30:09,300
Ouch!

6499
05:30:13,320 --> 05:30:13,800
Guys.

6500
05:30:29,480 --> 05:30:29,960
Okay.

6501
05:30:30,160 --> 05:30:31,440
I know what I'm gonna...

6502
05:30:31,440 --> 05:30:35,300
Before I set it down, I'm gonna see what the water situation is.

6503
05:30:37,480 --> 05:30:38,880
Before I set it down, I'm gonna see what the water situation is.

6504
05:30:38,880 --> 05:30:41,060
And then...

6505
05:30:41,060 --> 05:30:43,080
Then I'll walk away.

6506
05:30:44,200 --> 05:30:45,520
And then I'll...

6507
05:30:45,520 --> 05:30:47,140
And then I'll...

6508
05:30:47,140 --> 05:30:48,060
And then I'll...

6509
05:30:48,060 --> 05:30:49,360
And then I'll...

6510
05:30:49,360 --> 05:30:50,520
And then I'll go.

6511
05:30:51,000 --> 05:30:51,960
I think.

6512
05:30:55,360 --> 05:30:57,760
The mint who sold the outer world.

6513
05:31:00,000 --> 05:31:00,760
Okay.

6514
05:31:01,220 --> 05:31:01,980
Okay.

6515
05:31:04,120 --> 05:31:06,620
We understand how it works now.

6516
05:31:06,620 --> 05:31:08,620
We go off and then we go...

6517
05:31:08,620 --> 05:31:10,400
We pivot straight to the right.

6518
05:31:11,020 --> 05:31:12,100
Gotta put it right here.

6519
05:31:12,200 --> 05:31:12,860
We'll come back for you.

6520
05:31:19,160 --> 05:31:19,640
Alright.

6521
05:31:19,720 --> 05:31:20,180
I see that.

6522
05:31:29,950 --> 05:31:30,430
When?

6523
05:31:31,750 --> 05:31:32,770
When does it happen?

6524
05:31:38,890 --> 05:31:39,610
When does?

6525
05:31:54,610 --> 05:31:55,710
It sounds cute.

6526
05:32:18,160 --> 05:32:19,120
It sounds cute.

6527
05:32:19,120 --> 05:32:19,360
It sounds cute.

6528
05:32:19,360 --> 05:32:22,520
It sounds cute.

6529
05:32:22,520 --> 05:32:23,720
It sounds cute.

6530
05:32:23,980 --> 05:32:25,060
It sounds cute.

6531
05:32:31,560 --> 05:32:32,740
Oh my god.

6532
05:32:32,840 --> 05:32:33,220
Oh my god.

6533
05:32:33,220 --> 05:32:33,300
Fine.

6534
05:32:33,680 --> 05:32:34,540
Did you see something?

6535
05:32:35,160 --> 05:32:37,940
I saw him staring directly at me again.

6536
05:32:38,780 --> 05:32:39,300
I saw him staring directly at me again.

6537
05:32:39,300 --> 05:32:39,900
That's what I saw.

6538
05:32:42,260 --> 05:32:43,220
Why can't he...

6539
05:32:43,220 --> 05:32:44,700
At least he have a light, you know?

6540
05:32:47,280 --> 05:32:48,780
I think that's the most frustrating part.

6541
05:32:48,860 --> 05:32:50,280
Because I really can't hear him at all.

6542
05:32:50,420 --> 05:32:51,180
I can't hear his footsteps.

6543
05:33:10,340 --> 05:33:12,300
He will turn around once he starts looking.

6544
05:33:12,660 --> 05:33:12,980
I...

6545
05:33:13,480 --> 05:33:13,880
I...

6546
05:33:16,600 --> 05:33:17,020
Oh...

6547
05:33:20,080 --> 05:33:20,500
Oh...

6548
05:33:41,090 --> 05:33:41,750
I know.

6549
05:33:41,810 --> 05:33:42,670
You guys are gonna hate me.

6550
05:33:44,610 --> 05:33:45,370
You know what?

6551
05:33:45,490 --> 05:33:46,130
Never mind.

6552
05:33:46,230 --> 05:33:46,630
I give up.

6553
05:33:49,550 --> 05:33:50,450
I give up.

6554
05:33:52,070 --> 05:33:52,830
I give up.

6555
05:34:11,240 --> 05:34:11,940
He's there?

6556
05:34:42,120 --> 05:34:42,540
Yeah.

6557
05:34:42,620 --> 05:34:43,440
Thanks a whole lot.

6558
05:34:44,360 --> 05:34:44,780
Idiot.

6559
05:34:44,780 --> 05:34:45,460
You're also dead.

6560
05:34:47,880 --> 05:34:48,400
Oh...

6561
05:34:55,860 --> 05:34:57,580
Black screen makes me sleepy.

6562
05:34:59,940 --> 05:35:01,160
I took too long.

6563
05:35:01,320 --> 05:35:01,540
Yeah.

6564
05:35:01,580 --> 05:35:02,060
No shit.

6565
05:35:02,700 --> 05:35:03,460
I know.

6566
05:35:03,640 --> 05:35:04,240
But it's...

6567
05:35:05,620 --> 05:35:06,940
Look at all my footage.

6568
05:35:06,980 --> 05:35:08,060
It's just black screen.

6569
05:35:08,820 --> 05:35:09,340
It's...

6570
05:35:10,820 --> 05:35:11,340
It's...

6571
05:35:14,640 --> 05:35:15,560
Oh wait!

6572
05:35:17,380 --> 05:35:19,280
Are the... Are some of them...

6573
05:35:19,280 --> 05:35:19,500
Wait.

6574
05:35:19,580 --> 05:35:21,560
Some of the things when it shows out of the game?

6575
05:35:21,820 --> 05:35:22,600
It doesn't show that.

6576
05:35:22,800 --> 05:35:23,280
Interesting.

6577
05:35:26,460 --> 05:35:28,200
This area was the spookiest.

6578
05:35:28,300 --> 05:35:28,500
Really?

6579
05:35:28,640 --> 05:35:29,980
Not the one with the house?

6580
05:35:30,100 --> 05:35:32,080
Or like the concert hall one?

6581
05:35:32,640 --> 05:35:34,560
That one seems the scariest for me.

6582
05:35:35,540 --> 05:35:37,680
This is... This is tricky though.

6583
05:35:44,280 --> 05:35:46,060
It's because I can't see them.

6584
05:35:49,100 --> 05:35:51,000
That area was the hardest for me.

6585
05:35:51,000 --> 05:35:51,520
It's... Yeah.

6586
05:35:51,580 --> 05:35:52,540
You can't see them.

6587
05:35:52,680 --> 05:35:54,520
You can't... You can barely hear them.

6588
05:35:54,680 --> 05:35:55,780
It's... It's tricky.

6589
05:35:56,000 --> 05:35:56,340
It's tricky.

6590
05:36:04,180 --> 05:36:05,560
This area is really...

6591
05:36:05,560 --> 05:36:08,080
It's only difficult before you pass it through at the first...

6592
05:36:08,080 --> 05:36:08,780
At the first time.

6593
05:36:08,940 --> 05:36:09,260
Okay.

6594
05:36:14,480 --> 05:36:16,640
So maybe if I like...

6595
05:36:18,000 --> 05:36:19,960
Like if I can't outrun him...

6596
05:36:20,560 --> 05:36:24,060
But I have to have my light off anyway for when I...

6597
05:36:24,780 --> 05:36:26,180
Go to the...

6598
05:36:27,020 --> 05:36:27,540
Woooo...

6599
05:36:28,640 --> 05:36:30,240
When I go to the...

6600
05:36:30,700 --> 05:36:31,360
Do a flip?

6601
05:36:34,740 --> 05:36:35,760
The hole anyway.

6602
05:36:36,000 --> 05:36:37,660
So maybe I should just have it on.

6603
05:36:38,600 --> 05:36:40,000
Run to where I need to be.

6604
05:36:42,480 --> 05:36:43,320
And then...

6605
05:36:44,120 --> 05:36:46,100
Turn it off when I get there.

6606
05:36:46,800 --> 05:36:47,220
Maybe.

6607
05:36:49,420 --> 05:36:50,700
Focus the light on them.

6608
05:36:50,900 --> 05:36:51,800
I could do that too.

6609
05:36:51,960 --> 05:36:52,280
Yeah.

6610
05:36:57,540 --> 05:36:59,140
The focusing the light...

6611
05:36:59,140 --> 05:37:01,000
Scares me the most because it's like...

6612
05:37:01,000 --> 05:37:03,100
Having to switch between it and...

6613
05:37:04,780 --> 05:37:05,640
Covering the light.

6614
05:37:05,780 --> 05:37:07,320
I'll have to practice a little bit though.

6615
05:37:07,720 --> 05:37:07,880
Oops.

6616
05:37:07,880 --> 05:37:08,980
I forgot to push my wrap.

6617
05:37:11,320 --> 05:37:11,940
Come on.

6618
05:37:21,230 --> 05:37:21,730
Frozen!

6619
05:37:22,050 --> 05:37:23,210
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

6620
05:37:23,210 --> 05:37:23,710
Thank you!

6621
05:37:26,950 --> 05:37:28,470
I'm struggling a little guys.

6622
05:37:28,630 --> 05:37:29,230
I'm struggling.

6623
05:37:50,600 --> 05:37:51,160
Blip.

6624
05:37:51,860 --> 05:37:52,420
Blip.

6625
05:37:53,220 --> 05:37:54,480
There we go.

6626
05:37:54,680 --> 05:37:55,240
Okay.

6627
05:38:03,410 --> 05:38:03,970
Okay.

6628
05:38:05,130 --> 05:38:08,870
I feel like this is stealth but it also doesn't count so much.

6629
05:38:12,770 --> 05:38:14,290
Because I have to...

6630
05:38:14,290 --> 05:38:15,730
Seems like I have to get caught.

6631
05:38:16,650 --> 05:38:17,210
Justin!

6632
05:38:17,450 --> 05:38:18,690
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

6633
05:38:18,710 --> 05:38:19,350
Thank you!

6634
05:38:21,150 --> 05:38:22,230
Thank you, thank you.

6635
05:38:23,110 --> 05:38:23,930
Oh yeah, yeah.

6636
05:39:06,360 --> 05:39:07,440
Good night, mint and...

6637
05:39:07,440 --> 05:39:08,100
Good night!

6638
05:39:08,300 --> 05:39:09,600
Oh yeah, I haven't eaten...

6639
05:39:09,600 --> 05:39:11,500
I didn't realize how late it was.

6640
05:39:12,200 --> 05:39:14,760
Now I'm realizing I haven't had dinner yet.

6641
05:39:16,440 --> 05:39:17,840
I will have to...

6642
05:39:18,720 --> 05:39:20,220
Do that at some point.

6643
05:39:20,700 --> 05:39:22,220
Have to take another break.

6644
05:39:23,000 --> 05:39:24,020
Short break though.

6645
05:39:24,080 --> 05:39:24,700
Just to eat.

6646
05:39:27,460 --> 05:39:28,900
But it's only been 6 hours.

6647
05:39:29,220 --> 05:39:29,540
So...

6648
05:39:31,240 --> 05:39:31,880
This one?

6649
05:39:47,520 --> 05:39:48,000
This one?

6650
05:39:48,000 --> 05:39:49,080
Oh, I forgot to wake up.

6651
05:39:49,780 --> 05:39:50,440
There we go.

6652
05:39:50,540 --> 05:39:50,860
Okay.

6653
05:39:57,160 --> 05:39:57,640
Okay,

6654
05:40:04,400 --> 05:40:06,700
so I can focus...

6655
05:40:08,440 --> 05:40:10,160
So I can focus and then close.

6656
05:40:10,740 --> 05:40:11,980
And then open and close.

6657
05:40:12,240 --> 05:40:12,840
Okay, okay.

6658
05:40:13,120 --> 05:40:13,900
Good to know.

6659
05:40:19,390 --> 05:40:20,750
Now we go this way.

6660
05:40:25,300 --> 05:40:26,440
I wonder...

6661
05:40:26,440 --> 05:40:26,960
I wonder...

6662
05:40:26,960 --> 05:40:26,980
Okay.

6663
05:40:29,010 --> 05:40:29,820
Hold on real quick.

6664
05:40:31,640 --> 05:40:33,840
I'm putting my thing down.

6665
05:40:34,320 --> 05:40:34,880
I'm putting my thing down.

6666
05:40:34,980 --> 05:40:37,210
And I'm gonna go in a straight line.

6667
05:40:39,100 --> 05:40:40,560
I just wanna see.

6668
05:40:41,540 --> 05:40:44,200
I think the elevator is the only way down, right?

6669
05:40:46,460 --> 05:40:47,400
I can't...

6670
05:40:47,400 --> 05:40:51,000
But it seems...

6671
05:40:51,000 --> 05:40:52,400
What do ghosts eat?

6672
05:40:52,560 --> 05:40:54,420
I just possess somebody that...

6673
05:40:54,860 --> 05:40:55,500
Could be you.

6674
05:40:55,680 --> 05:40:56,940
What are you having for dinner tonight?

6675
05:40:58,400 --> 05:41:00,280
Possess somebody and then I...

6676
05:41:01,180 --> 05:41:02,260
You know...

6677
05:41:03,380 --> 05:41:04,780
Just have what they're having.

6678
05:41:10,520 --> 05:41:11,360
Pretty much...

6679
05:41:11,360 --> 05:41:11,600
Oh wait.

6680
05:41:11,840 --> 05:41:13,120
There's an elevator here?

6681
05:41:13,520 --> 05:41:14,800
But these all...

6682
05:41:14,800 --> 05:41:16,320
I wouldn't be able to make it.

6683
05:41:21,550 --> 05:41:22,110
Right?

6684
05:41:22,110 --> 05:41:22,590
I...

6685
05:41:24,150 --> 05:41:25,670
Show me where all the elevators are.

6686
05:41:25,790 --> 05:41:25,950
Wait.

6687
05:41:26,010 --> 05:41:26,250
Okay.

6688
05:41:26,290 --> 05:41:26,530
Hold on.

6689
05:41:27,430 --> 05:41:29,210
If I have to wake back up, I wake back up.

6690
05:41:37,900 --> 05:41:39,180
That wasn't supposed to happen.

6691
05:41:44,080 --> 05:41:44,440
That...

6692
05:41:44,440 --> 05:41:45,400
I didn't mean to happen.

6693
05:41:46,100 --> 05:41:46,460
Sorry.

6694
05:41:51,300 --> 05:41:51,660
Okay.

6695
05:41:51,660 --> 05:41:51,780
Okay.

6696
05:41:53,780 --> 05:41:55,840
The real enemy is the gravity.

6697
05:41:58,400 --> 05:41:59,120
Truly.

6698
05:41:59,580 --> 05:42:00,660
A terror.

6699
05:42:09,930 --> 05:42:10,650
Door?

6700
05:42:10,650 --> 05:42:11,370
Door.

6701
05:42:11,590 --> 05:42:12,210
Oh, sorry.

6702
05:42:12,350 --> 05:42:12,730
Door.

6703
05:42:19,960 --> 05:42:20,680
Okay.

6704
05:42:21,260 --> 05:42:22,140
Let's see.

6705
05:42:22,340 --> 05:42:23,480
I'm checking again.

6706
05:42:31,280 --> 05:42:33,140
Where this leads to?

6707
05:42:39,230 --> 05:42:41,030
If it's the only way I can go.

6708
05:42:41,290 --> 05:42:42,010
Over there.

6709
05:42:42,390 --> 05:42:45,310
I think it's the quote on quote easiest though.

6710
05:42:47,850 --> 05:42:49,410
I think it was...

6711
05:42:49,410 --> 05:42:52,910
I think it's the quote on quote easiest way.

6712
05:42:53,910 --> 05:42:54,630
Cause I...

6713
05:42:54,630 --> 05:42:56,190
Unless it's like in a cave in here.

6714
05:42:56,330 --> 05:42:58,130
But then there's also a guy stalking the knight.

6715
05:42:58,450 --> 05:42:58,970
So...

6716
05:43:01,290 --> 05:43:02,310
It's not so good.

6717
05:43:03,690 --> 05:43:04,210
Wait.

6718
05:43:04,290 --> 05:43:04,750
Okay.

6719
05:43:06,330 --> 05:43:08,650
Mint is too spicy of a flavor?

6720
05:43:10,630 --> 05:43:12,330
Even I can have mint.

6721
05:43:12,430 --> 05:43:13,670
And I can have anything spicy.

6722
05:43:17,470 --> 05:43:18,650
Are you sure?

6723
05:43:21,290 --> 05:43:22,470
Are you sure?

6724
05:43:44,750 --> 05:43:45,830
Mint too spicy.

6725
05:43:51,210 --> 05:43:51,810
Okay.

6726
05:44:00,430 --> 05:44:01,410
We're going up.

6727
05:44:07,960 --> 05:44:08,880
Light it up.

6728
05:44:13,510 --> 05:44:14,030
Oh...

6729
05:44:14,710 --> 05:44:18,210
I hear like him walking around here too.

6730
05:44:18,510 --> 05:44:19,790
So I'm kind of curious.

6731
05:44:19,990 --> 05:44:21,430
Who comes this way?

6732
05:44:21,950 --> 05:44:23,550
And up like this elevator.

6733
05:44:24,110 --> 05:44:25,290
Is there a guy over there?

6734
05:44:25,410 --> 05:44:26,270
I just don't notice him.

6735
05:44:26,990 --> 05:44:28,170
Is there a guy in there?

6736
05:44:28,410 --> 05:44:29,490
Are there three guys?

6737
05:44:29,810 --> 05:44:30,830
How many guys are there?

6738
05:44:32,790 --> 05:44:33,730
I don't know.

6739
05:44:35,370 --> 05:44:36,630
So I think...

6740
05:44:37,410 --> 05:44:39,410
Just finish the DLC on my end.

6741
05:44:39,410 --> 05:44:39,990
What?

6742
05:44:41,150 --> 05:44:42,490
Absolutely 10 out of 10 experience.

6743
05:44:42,670 --> 05:44:45,210
Kyle, how did you get past this bar?

6744
05:44:47,050 --> 05:44:47,950
Kyle, help.

6745
05:44:48,130 --> 05:44:49,510
Kyle, let's get there.

6746
05:44:49,630 --> 05:44:49,930
Kyle?

6747
05:44:53,530 --> 05:44:54,530
Five guys?

6748
05:44:56,810 --> 05:45:00,550
I love five guys.

6749
05:45:01,810 --> 05:45:02,450
Yummy.

6750
05:45:04,670 --> 05:45:05,750
No help.

6751
05:45:06,130 --> 05:45:07,110
I hate you all.

6752
05:45:07,110 --> 05:45:08,050
You know what?

6753
05:45:08,090 --> 05:45:08,930
What are you saying?

6754
05:45:09,010 --> 05:45:09,590
She hates us.

6755
05:45:09,670 --> 05:45:10,290
It's real.

6756
05:45:10,790 --> 05:45:11,570
It's true.

6757
05:45:13,710 --> 05:45:14,670
It's the truth.

6758
05:46:00,450 --> 05:46:02,130
I think he sees me, you guys.

6759
05:46:08,370 --> 05:46:09,330
I lived?

6760
05:46:12,650 --> 05:46:13,530
Oh, he's coming.

6761
05:46:14,990 --> 05:46:16,090
Hey, how did you get here?

6762
05:46:16,830 --> 05:46:17,310
Hey.

6763
05:46:17,750 --> 05:46:18,230
Hey.

6764
05:46:18,510 --> 05:46:18,990
Hey.

6765
05:46:19,470 --> 05:46:21,890
Hey, leave me alone.

6766
05:46:22,590 --> 05:46:22,850
Hey.

6767
05:46:22,910 --> 05:46:23,390
Hey.

6768
05:46:24,230 --> 05:46:24,710
Hey.

6769
05:46:24,930 --> 05:46:25,270
Hey.

6770
05:46:25,270 --> 05:46:25,690
Hey.

6771
05:46:26,310 --> 05:46:27,310
Hey, leave me alone.

6772
05:46:31,000 --> 05:46:32,040
I think he gave up.

6773
05:46:40,900 --> 05:46:41,620
Let's go back.

6774
05:46:47,740 --> 05:46:49,080
I think he got me.

6775
05:46:49,320 --> 05:46:50,240
Oh, bing-bong.

6776
05:46:51,660 --> 05:46:53,180
You're setting off your own alarm.

6777
05:46:57,760 --> 05:46:58,860
Can-can, everybody.

6778
05:46:59,040 --> 05:46:59,560
Wake up.

6779
05:47:01,080 --> 05:47:01,960
Wake up.

6780
05:47:01,960 --> 05:47:04,500
What if I just blew out all of their flames?

6781
05:47:04,620 --> 05:47:06,000
Wouldn't that be kind of diabolical?

6782
05:47:09,400 --> 05:47:11,240
That would save me so much time.

6783
05:47:13,120 --> 05:47:15,100
Why can't I blow out their flames, huh?

6784
05:47:21,020 --> 05:47:22,260
They're too dead asleep.

6785
05:47:22,640 --> 05:47:23,860
Oh, gosh.

6786
05:47:25,220 --> 05:47:26,440
Now we're back to where we started.

6787
05:47:26,440 --> 05:47:26,580
Now we're back to where we started.

6788
05:47:29,780 --> 05:47:31,440
There's an extinguish on everything.

6789
05:47:31,860 --> 05:47:33,180
You just go up and you...

6790
05:47:33,820 --> 05:47:34,860
You extinguish it.

6791
05:47:35,860 --> 05:47:38,120
They should be able to extinguish their own fires.

6792
05:47:39,740 --> 05:47:40,620
Yeah, take that.

6793
05:47:41,600 --> 05:47:43,000
You don't want me hanging around here?

6794
05:47:45,240 --> 05:47:46,120
You don't want me hanging around here?

6795
05:47:46,120 --> 05:47:47,560
I don't want you hanging around here either.

6796
05:47:49,420 --> 05:47:50,280
Oh, there it goes.

6797
05:47:53,290 --> 05:47:54,410
I'm running out of time.

6798
05:47:54,570 --> 05:47:55,990
I'm stalling too much.

6799
05:47:55,990 --> 05:47:56,870
Oh, this way.

6800
05:47:58,010 --> 05:47:58,450
Here

6801
05:48:13,640 --> 05:48:14,220
it comes.

6802
05:48:23,160 --> 05:48:24,820
I think I hear him to my right.

6803
05:48:25,540 --> 05:48:26,660
So I'm just gonna go straight.

6804
05:48:27,880 --> 05:48:28,760
Oh, shit.

6805
05:48:31,980 --> 05:48:32,420
Run!

6806
05:49:01,760 --> 05:49:03,620
It sounded like he was on my right.

6807
05:49:04,380 --> 05:49:05,120
Guess not.

6808
05:49:09,080 --> 05:49:11,800
Perthian lungs are too small to blow out their flames.

6809
05:49:12,400 --> 05:49:13,000
Okay, then.

6810
05:49:13,000 --> 05:49:14,380
And I'm gonna get a bucket of water.

6811
05:49:14,940 --> 05:49:17,120
I'm gonna cup the water in my hands.

6812
05:49:17,340 --> 05:49:19,220
And I'm just gonna douse him.

6813
05:49:24,020 --> 05:49:26,600
This guy is such a freak.

6814
05:49:34,730 --> 05:49:36,170
Yeah, carry a squirt gun.

6815
05:49:50,730 --> 05:49:52,150
I think I'm already screwed.

6816
05:49:56,440 --> 05:49:57,840
Is he coming this way, you think?

6817
05:49:57,920 --> 05:49:58,600
Or did he give up?

6818
05:50:11,590 --> 05:50:14,230
I wonder if there's a way I can sneak past him there.

6819
05:50:14,690 --> 05:50:16,050
Oh my gosh.

6820
05:50:16,210 --> 05:50:16,650
Please.

6821
05:50:18,690 --> 05:50:19,130
Oh.

6822
05:50:25,120 --> 05:50:27,080
Maybe I do need the baby mode on.

6823
05:50:27,160 --> 05:50:27,820
Just so I can progress.

6824
05:50:30,300 --> 05:50:33,280
Maybe I need baby mode on so I can progress through the game.

6825
05:50:34,440 --> 05:50:34,880
Maybe I need baby mode on so I can progress through the game.

6826
05:50:34,880 --> 05:50:34,980
Oh.

6827
05:50:37,200 --> 05:50:37,640
Oh.

6828
05:50:39,180 --> 05:50:39,980
I'm hungry.

6829
05:50:44,120 --> 05:50:45,520
Just give him the runaround.

6830
05:50:45,740 --> 05:50:46,480
Oh, I'm trying.

6831
05:50:48,340 --> 05:50:49,220
I'm trying.

6832
05:50:49,380 --> 05:50:50,320
I just gotta...

6833
05:50:50,320 --> 05:50:51,740
He's faster than me though.

6834
05:50:51,780 --> 05:50:52,320
He's pretty fast.

6835
05:50:56,940 --> 05:50:58,120
It is a skill issue.

6836
05:50:58,280 --> 05:50:58,880
100%, yeah.

6837
05:51:00,240 --> 05:51:01,140
Yeah, you can say it.

6838
05:51:01,200 --> 05:51:01,680
Skill issue.

6839
05:51:01,760 --> 05:51:02,140
Yeah, whatever.

6840
05:51:02,440 --> 05:51:03,360
It's a skill issue.

6841
05:51:04,300 --> 05:51:04,880
Pretty much.

6842
05:51:24,510 --> 05:51:25,490
What am I looking at?

6843
05:51:28,470 --> 05:51:30,090
I think I'm looking in the wrong direction.

6844
05:51:30,370 --> 05:51:30,950
Okay, hold on.

6845
05:51:32,850 --> 05:51:33,730
Wait, where am I?

6846
05:51:33,830 --> 05:51:34,590
Oh, I turned around.

6847
05:51:39,480 --> 05:51:40,860
I'm trying to troll him a little bit.

6848
05:51:41,300 --> 05:51:42,640
What are my lights coming from over there?

6849
05:51:43,100 --> 05:51:43,720
You don't know.

6850
05:51:43,880 --> 05:51:48,360
How do I get to the other...

6851
05:51:58,560 --> 05:51:59,500
Don't turn around, mister.

6852
05:52:06,700 --> 05:52:07,420
Where's the exit?

6853
05:52:08,360 --> 05:52:09,140
Oh, I found it.

6854
05:52:12,180 --> 05:52:13,020
He's not coming still.

6855
05:52:22,160 --> 05:52:25,300
Now I need to know how to not fall into the water here.

6856
05:52:26,120 --> 05:52:27,100
Oh, you guys.

6857
05:52:27,140 --> 05:52:29,120
I probably should just meditate and redo this.

6858
05:52:29,260 --> 05:52:30,540
I don't think I'm gonna have enough time.

6859
05:52:33,420 --> 05:52:33,820
Okay.

6860
05:52:33,820 --> 05:52:34,220
Okay.

6861
05:52:37,760 --> 05:52:38,700
So close.

6862
05:52:50,440 --> 05:52:51,900
I think it's just the one guy.

6863
05:52:52,120 --> 05:52:52,740
I sure hope so.

6864
05:52:53,260 --> 05:52:54,520
Please be honest, guys.

6865
05:52:54,580 --> 05:52:55,280
There's no one else.

6866
05:52:55,660 --> 05:52:56,580
By the...

6867
05:52:58,160 --> 05:52:59,160
I will cry.

6868
05:53:00,500 --> 05:53:02,720
If there's someone else by the actual thing.

6869
05:53:03,200 --> 05:53:03,240
If there's someone else by the actual thing.

6870
05:53:03,300 --> 05:53:03,820
Okay.

6871
05:53:12,460 --> 05:53:13,660
Don't just put smileys!

6872
05:53:14,800 --> 05:53:18,380
You guys know I'm struggling and you hate me so much!

6873
05:53:18,660 --> 05:53:19,160
You guys know I'm struggling and you hate me so much!

6874
05:53:19,160 --> 05:53:19,720
You just hate me!

6875
05:53:50,170 --> 05:53:52,350
I'm having so much fun in my death loop.

6876
05:54:28,150 --> 05:54:30,330
Please stop noticing me!

6877
05:54:30,550 --> 05:54:31,190
Please!

6878
05:54:32,130 --> 05:54:34,510
Please stop noticing me!

6879
05:54:36,420 --> 05:54:38,410
Why does elevator have to go back up?

6880
05:54:39,510 --> 05:54:41,370
Stop noticing me, please!

6881
05:54:41,370 --> 05:54:41,510
Stop noticing me, please!

6882
05:54:43,810 --> 05:54:44,790
Run past him.

6883
05:54:44,970 --> 05:54:46,250
He's definitely gonna grab me.

6884
05:54:46,630 --> 05:54:47,370
Run past him.

6885
05:54:48,570 --> 05:54:49,010
He's definitely gonna grab me.

6886
05:54:49,710 --> 05:54:50,750
There's not land there.

6887
05:55:00,040 --> 05:55:02,080
I thought that was my own vision.

6888
05:55:02,260 --> 05:55:03,640
I thought that was my own vision.

6889
05:55:03,740 --> 05:55:04,820
Going nutty.

6890
05:55:21,100 --> 05:55:22,760
All I am is frustrated.

6891
05:55:57,190 --> 05:55:58,810
So used to going to the plate.

6892
05:55:58,830 --> 05:56:03,070
So used to going to the plate.

6893
05:56:03,090 --> 05:56:03,270
Okay.

6894
05:56:03,970 --> 05:56:05,970
Let's go all the way back.

6895
05:56:34,240 --> 05:56:34,900
Okay.

6896
05:56:41,160 --> 05:56:42,760
Coming in hot.

6897
05:56:43,760 --> 05:56:44,680
You know what?

6898
05:56:44,700 --> 05:56:45,440
Let's come in hot.

6899
05:56:49,620 --> 05:56:50,940
Good enough.

6900
05:56:52,760 --> 05:56:53,420
Okay.

6901
05:57:00,100 --> 05:57:00,940
Let's see.

6902
05:57:07,280 --> 05:57:08,480
Let's get our artifact.

6903
05:57:09,520 --> 05:57:10,000
Let's get our artifact.

6904
05:57:11,260 --> 05:57:13,300
How far can this...

6905
05:57:13,300 --> 05:57:16,140
There we go.

6906
05:57:17,340 --> 05:57:18,600
Now we'll always know.

6907
05:57:20,120 --> 05:57:20,600
Okay.

6908
05:57:21,520 --> 05:57:22,000
Wait.

6909
05:57:22,180 --> 05:57:23,260
But I have to put this...

6910
05:57:23,260 --> 05:57:23,500
Wait.

6911
05:57:23,660 --> 05:57:25,180
I have to put it away though, don't I?

6912
05:57:25,260 --> 05:57:27,440
To get the thing.

6913
05:57:27,680 --> 05:57:28,740
Actually maybe...

6914
05:57:29,960 --> 05:57:31,240
Maybe I can't do that.

6915
05:57:31,480 --> 05:57:31,620
Maybe I can't do that.

6916
05:57:33,760 --> 05:57:35,580
Because we have to grab the...

6917
05:57:37,920 --> 05:57:39,340
We have to grab the artifact.

6918
05:57:56,220 --> 05:57:57,760
Oh, it still works.

6919
05:57:57,880 --> 05:57:58,060
Nice.

6920
05:57:58,240 --> 05:57:58,520
Okay.

6921
05:58:03,770 --> 05:58:05,290
Is my endurance okay?

6922
05:58:05,550 --> 05:58:08,070
I'm just... I'm just frustrated.

6923
05:58:10,450 --> 05:58:11,330
It's all...

6924
05:58:11,330 --> 05:58:11,870
It's all...

6925
05:58:15,080 --> 05:58:16,800
I think because I'm getting hangry.

6926
05:58:16,940 --> 05:58:17,120
I think because I'm getting hangry.

6927
05:58:19,640 --> 05:58:20,640
But I'm like...

6928
05:58:20,640 --> 05:58:21,040
But I'm like...

6929
05:58:21,040 --> 05:58:22,820
Wanting to do this before I eat.

6930
05:58:23,660 --> 05:58:24,840
And I want to take a break.

6931
05:58:24,960 --> 05:58:26,320
Because I just want to get through it.

6932
05:58:26,600 --> 05:58:29,880
Because we've made no progress in probably like a fucking hour.

6933
05:58:33,900 --> 05:58:35,180
And that annoys me.

6934
05:59:09,720 --> 05:59:10,820
But right now...

6935
05:59:10,820 --> 05:59:10,920
But right now...

6936
05:59:12,340 --> 05:59:13,240
I'm not...

6937
05:59:14,260 --> 05:59:15,500
I'm less than okay.

6938
05:59:15,700 --> 05:59:16,160
But I'm okay.

6939
05:59:18,940 --> 05:59:20,280
I'm less than okay.

6940
05:59:20,400 --> 05:59:20,900
But I'm okay.

6941
05:59:29,910 --> 05:59:30,470
Oh.

6942
05:59:36,590 --> 05:59:40,330
Viewers are encouraging a streamer called Minto who is overcoming...

6943
05:59:46,710 --> 05:59:47,570
Okie dokie.

6944
05:59:49,630 --> 05:59:50,190
Alright.

6945
05:59:50,190 --> 05:59:52,110
Let's go back to the boat.

6946
05:59:53,710 --> 05:59:55,990
And blow out the candles.

6947
05:59:58,910 --> 05:59:59,950
And then...

6948
06:00:03,300 --> 06:00:04,500
I wonder though.

6949
06:00:05,180 --> 06:00:05,940
Hold on.

6950
06:00:08,050 --> 06:00:09,290
Before we do so.

6951
06:00:11,190 --> 06:00:12,370
Before we do so.

6952
06:00:17,390 --> 06:00:18,550
Let's get a...

6953
06:00:18,550 --> 06:00:21,450
Let's get a little more acclimated.

6954
06:00:22,830 --> 06:00:23,470
With our...

6955
06:00:24,370 --> 06:00:25,470
With our terrain.

6956
06:00:29,810 --> 06:00:30,790
We go down here.

6957
06:00:31,290 --> 06:00:32,130
There's no one here, right?

6958
06:00:33,210 --> 06:00:33,850
No one here.

6959
06:00:35,050 --> 06:00:36,290
So if I just go...

6960
06:00:37,550 --> 06:00:38,190
Where's the...

6961
06:00:40,330 --> 06:00:40,650
Ok.

6962
06:00:43,270 --> 06:00:43,910
I see.

6963
06:00:44,010 --> 06:00:44,150
I see.

6964
06:00:44,250 --> 06:00:44,430
I see.

6965
06:00:45,270 --> 06:00:45,830
So here.

6966
06:00:45,950 --> 06:00:46,630
We can go here.

6967
06:00:47,030 --> 06:00:47,190
Ok.

6968
06:00:47,250 --> 06:00:47,650
This is...

6969
06:00:49,310 --> 06:00:50,770
This is what I was trying to find.

6970
06:00:50,930 --> 06:00:52,090
I thought it was another bridge.

6971
06:00:52,170 --> 06:00:53,190
I knew there was another bridge.

6972
06:00:53,490 --> 06:00:55,050
But I thought it was like... immediate.

6973
06:00:55,490 --> 06:00:57,350
So if he starts seeing me here...

6974
06:00:57,350 --> 06:00:58,310
Then I can just run here.

6975
06:00:58,630 --> 06:00:58,810
Ok.

6976
06:00:58,890 --> 06:00:59,090
Ok.

6977
06:00:59,170 --> 06:00:59,310
Ok.

6978
06:00:59,750 --> 06:01:00,150
Ok.

6979
06:01:00,290 --> 06:01:00,630
Ok.

6980
06:01:00,670 --> 06:01:00,850
Ok.

6981
06:01:00,890 --> 06:01:00,970
Ok.

6982
06:01:00,970 --> 06:01:01,090
Ok.

6983
06:01:01,150 --> 06:01:01,210
Ok.

6984
06:01:01,450 --> 06:01:03,810
See that's what was tripping me up a lot.

6985
06:01:04,610 --> 06:01:05,930
And then here...

6986
06:01:11,260 --> 06:01:12,200
It's just straight.

6987
06:01:14,020 --> 06:01:14,420
From...

6988
06:01:14,420 --> 06:01:15,100
In here.

6989
06:01:15,600 --> 06:01:16,340
Just straight.

6990
06:01:20,280 --> 06:01:21,760
It's gonna see me in the light though.

6991
06:01:22,000 --> 06:01:25,060
I didn't know there were candles there.

6992
06:01:25,780 --> 06:01:26,180
Um...

6993
06:01:28,220 --> 06:01:29,560
Straight until you hit the candles.

6994
06:01:29,620 --> 06:01:30,320
And then to the left.

6995
06:01:31,260 --> 06:01:32,100
And then...

6996
06:01:32,100 --> 06:01:33,820
We go down the stairs.

6997
06:01:34,120 --> 06:01:34,480
Ok.

6998
06:01:39,370 --> 06:01:39,790
Alright.

6999
06:01:39,870 --> 06:01:40,710
That should help a little bit.

7000
06:01:44,680 --> 06:01:46,480
I thought I knew what I was doing before.

7001
06:01:47,200 --> 06:01:48,780
But I did not.

7002
06:01:51,260 --> 06:01:53,140
I just don't know when he'll give up.

7003
06:01:53,940 --> 06:01:54,360
But...

7004
06:01:58,320 --> 06:01:59,900
The music freaked me out for a second.

7005
06:02:06,700 --> 06:02:07,120
Ok.

7006
06:02:10,500 --> 06:02:11,280
Will he?

7007
06:02:11,400 --> 06:02:12,480
Well, maybe not.

7008
06:02:12,660 --> 06:02:14,780
But if he doesn't...

7009
06:02:15,320 --> 06:02:16,360
Whatever I guess.

7010
06:02:18,420 --> 06:02:20,980
If he does, that's pretty cool.

7011
06:02:21,260 --> 06:02:22,400
If he doesn't...

7012
06:02:22,400 --> 06:02:23,000
Well...

7013
06:02:25,000 --> 06:02:26,240
We'll just keep on going.

7014
06:02:26,480 --> 06:02:26,700
Ok.

7015
06:02:26,800 --> 06:02:27,820
I just felt the...

7016
06:02:28,340 --> 06:02:29,920
The power thing go out.

7017
06:02:33,360 --> 06:02:33,880
Oop.

7018
06:02:33,920 --> 06:02:34,480
Wrong thing.

7019
06:02:34,680 --> 06:02:35,300
There we go.

7020
06:02:41,380 --> 06:02:41,920
Oh.

7021
06:02:42,080 --> 06:02:44,420
I heard the bells for like two seconds.

7022
06:02:44,500 --> 06:02:45,020
That's so funny.

7023
06:02:46,140 --> 06:02:47,840
Can't catch me today, sucker!

7024
06:02:50,660 --> 06:02:51,740
And hand.

7025
06:02:55,020 --> 06:02:55,560
Ok.

7026
06:02:58,280 --> 06:02:58,820
Oop.

7027
06:03:02,520 --> 06:03:03,060
Oop.

7028
06:03:03,240 --> 06:03:03,500
Oop.

7029
06:03:04,020 --> 06:03:08,220
Use your light a bit to avoid drowning.

7030
06:03:09,240 --> 06:03:09,780
Yeah.

7031
06:03:09,860 --> 06:03:10,460
I think...

7032
06:03:10,460 --> 06:03:12,040
I will have it up.

7033
06:03:12,040 --> 06:03:14,600
I think it's fine to have it up.

7034
06:03:14,940 --> 06:03:15,960
If um...

7035
06:03:17,300 --> 06:03:18,160
If I'm like...

7036
06:03:18,160 --> 06:03:18,840
Running away from him.

7037
06:03:19,060 --> 06:03:19,580
Oh wait.

7038
06:03:19,700 --> 06:03:19,960
No.

7039
06:03:20,580 --> 06:03:23,440
I can't have the light because I'll get spotted and the bells will go off.

7040
06:03:23,600 --> 06:03:24,760
Well, I'll have to like...

7041
06:03:25,520 --> 06:03:26,800
Quickly conceal it, you know.

7042
06:03:28,100 --> 06:03:29,320
Let's not waste anymore time.

7043
06:03:32,380 --> 06:03:33,180
I'm just gonna...

7044
06:03:33,800 --> 06:03:34,220
Drown.

7045
06:03:35,100 --> 06:03:36,320
Or die or something.

7046
06:03:36,560 --> 06:03:37,280
I'm just gonna...

7047
06:03:37,280 --> 06:03:38,240
So we can...

7048
06:03:38,240 --> 06:03:40,240
Quickly get back to the beginning.

7049
06:03:47,430 --> 06:03:47,990
Ok.

7050
06:03:47,990 --> 06:03:48,550
Ok.

7051
06:03:58,300 --> 06:03:58,860
Please.

7052
06:03:59,040 --> 06:03:59,300
Please.

7053
06:03:59,380 --> 06:03:59,660
Please.

7054
06:04:01,400 --> 06:04:01,960
Hopefully...

7055
06:04:01,960 --> 06:04:03,420
I can game.

7056
06:04:03,640 --> 06:04:04,700
Please let me game.

7057
06:04:04,900 --> 06:04:05,420
Please.

7058
06:04:07,500 --> 06:04:09,400
I think I just heard the...

7059
06:04:11,100 --> 06:04:12,500
Things still going down.

7060
06:04:12,760 --> 06:04:14,380
The elevators.

7061
06:04:17,160 --> 06:04:18,280
Please let me game.

7062
06:04:19,480 --> 06:04:20,560
Please let me game.

7063
06:04:29,520 --> 06:04:29,960
Ok.

7064
06:04:30,100 --> 06:04:31,240
So it was...

7065
06:04:34,630 --> 06:04:35,510
It was...

7066
06:04:36,510 --> 06:04:37,150
Distract him.

7067
06:04:37,350 --> 06:04:38,330
Have him come forward.

7068
06:04:38,530 --> 06:04:39,270
Go to the right.

7069
06:04:40,630 --> 06:04:41,850
Don't die in the water.

7070
06:04:43,730 --> 06:04:44,170
Right?

7071
06:04:46,130 --> 06:04:46,870
I think.

7072
06:04:48,690 --> 06:04:49,290
I think.

7073
06:04:51,370 --> 06:04:52,350
Cross the bridge.

7074
06:04:52,670 --> 06:04:54,590
Yeah, but I won't even be able to see the bridge, right?

7075
06:04:54,910 --> 06:04:55,890
He's gonna be coming after me.

7076
06:04:55,910 --> 06:04:56,170
Right?

7077
06:04:59,070 --> 06:04:59,510
So...

7078
06:05:00,610 --> 06:05:01,050
Um...

7079
06:05:07,400 --> 06:05:08,300
Straight but hug...

7080
06:05:08,300 --> 06:05:09,960
Straight but hug the right wall.

7081
06:05:10,200 --> 06:05:10,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7082
06:05:11,580 --> 06:05:13,420
You can flicker your life to see it.

7083
06:05:13,500 --> 06:05:13,660
Ok.

7084
06:05:17,900 --> 06:05:18,820
Here it is.

7085
06:05:22,460 --> 06:05:23,360
So it's here.

7086
06:05:24,940 --> 06:05:25,380
Hey.

7087
06:05:26,300 --> 06:05:26,940
Hey dummy.

7088
06:05:27,980 --> 06:05:28,680
Yeah, come here.

7089
06:05:42,830 --> 06:05:44,090
He just showed me the exit.

7090
06:05:44,690 --> 06:05:45,470
Don't look this way.

7091
06:05:46,270 --> 06:05:46,890
Oh shit.

7092
06:05:57,060 --> 06:05:57,420
Yeah?

7093
06:05:58,380 --> 06:05:58,740
Yeah?

7094
06:05:58,740 --> 06:05:59,400
What are you seeing?

7095
06:05:59,780 --> 06:06:00,580
What are you seeing, huh?

7096
06:06:08,800 --> 06:06:09,320
Oh gosh.

7097
06:06:09,820 --> 06:06:10,320
Oh gosh.

7098
06:06:10,480 --> 06:06:10,800
Straight?

7099
06:06:32,120 --> 06:06:33,440
I think I still hear him coming.

7100
06:06:40,520 --> 06:06:41,240
I think I still hear him coming.

7101
06:06:41,240 --> 06:06:41,460
Where am I?

7102
06:06:42,520 --> 06:06:42,880
Where's...

7103
06:06:43,740 --> 06:06:44,640
Is there an elevator?

7104
06:06:45,440 --> 06:06:46,620
Coming in here?

7105
06:06:47,600 --> 06:06:48,220
I'm scared.

7106
06:06:51,040 --> 06:06:51,780
Is there...

7107
06:06:52,420 --> 06:06:53,080
Is there...

7108
06:06:53,080 --> 06:06:53,320
Is there an elevator?

7109
06:06:55,900 --> 06:06:56,340
Shoot.

7110
06:06:58,180 --> 06:06:58,620
Nooooooo!

7111
06:07:03,180 --> 06:07:03,620
Awww.

7112
06:07:06,970 --> 06:07:08,610
You made it to phase two!

7113
06:07:18,780 --> 06:07:21,160
You might wanna put the light down to get a better look.

7114
06:07:27,450 --> 06:07:29,290
I don't even know where I can put it down.

7115
06:07:31,410 --> 06:07:33,010
I don't even know where I can put it down.

7116
06:07:33,150 --> 06:07:33,310
I don't even know where I can put it down.

7117
06:07:33,810 --> 06:07:34,950
Put the light down upstairs.

7118
06:07:35,110 --> 06:07:36,370
If I can... I can't even see anything!

7119
06:07:37,130 --> 06:07:37,530
Oh.

7120
06:07:40,070 --> 06:07:40,470
Shit.

7121
06:07:43,860 --> 06:07:44,540
I'm stuck.

7122
06:07:45,340 --> 06:07:45,940
Trapped somewhere.

7123
06:07:46,120 --> 06:07:47,080
I'm going downstairs.

7124
06:07:47,600 --> 06:07:48,160
Screw it.

7125
06:07:54,880 --> 06:07:56,100
I'm lost in the sauce.

7126
06:07:58,340 --> 06:07:58,940
I'm lost.

7127
06:07:59,240 --> 06:07:59,560
I'm lost.

7128
06:08:00,080 --> 06:08:01,040
In the sauce.

7129
06:08:11,240 --> 06:08:12,060
Put it down now?

7130
06:08:12,260 --> 06:08:12,460
Ok.

7131
06:08:13,140 --> 06:08:13,540
Uh.

7132
06:08:19,790 --> 06:08:20,230
Ok.

7133
06:08:21,330 --> 06:08:21,770
Ok.

7134
06:08:24,290 --> 06:08:25,590
You won't see me though, right?

7135
06:08:25,650 --> 06:08:25,790
Ok.

7136
06:08:26,090 --> 06:08:26,530
So...

7137
06:08:27,370 --> 06:08:29,010
We go upstairs...

7138
06:08:29,010 --> 06:08:30,050
Oh there's two of them!

7139
06:08:31,090 --> 06:08:31,890
No way.

7140
06:08:31,990 --> 06:08:32,990
There's two of them.

7141
06:08:35,290 --> 06:08:35,730
Ok.

7142
06:08:37,670 --> 06:08:39,190
How did I avoid both of them?

7143
06:08:39,370 --> 06:08:40,750
It's kind of impressive, right?

7144
06:08:41,870 --> 06:08:43,030
Impressive in its own right?

7145
06:08:43,130 --> 06:08:43,470
Maybe?

7146
06:08:44,090 --> 06:08:44,530
Ok.

7147
06:08:44,550 --> 06:08:45,170
Over here?

7148
06:08:46,710 --> 06:08:47,150
Here?

7149
06:08:48,010 --> 06:08:48,430
Oh wow.

7150
06:08:48,630 --> 06:08:50,390
This is really obnoxious.

7151
06:08:51,270 --> 06:08:52,450
Who designed this?

7152
06:08:55,350 --> 06:08:56,890
Who designed this level?

7153
06:08:57,170 --> 06:08:57,630
Who designed this level?

7154
06:08:57,630 --> 06:08:57,710
Who designed this level?

7155
06:08:57,710 --> 06:08:58,390
Is that it, right?

7156
06:08:59,970 --> 06:09:01,210
Oh here, here, here.

7157
06:09:02,530 --> 06:09:03,930
And there's a light thing.

7158
06:09:04,090 --> 06:09:05,050
Oh my god!

7159
06:09:07,090 --> 06:09:07,530
What?

7160
06:09:09,050 --> 06:09:09,490
Jeffrey!

7161
06:09:16,960 --> 06:09:19,560
So I'm kind of in like the worst position in here.

7162
06:09:19,820 --> 06:09:21,760
So I'm kind of in like the worst position in here.

7163
06:09:23,700 --> 06:09:27,300
I'm kind of in a really bad spot right now at the moment, actually.

7164
06:09:30,760 --> 06:09:31,760
I wish that was you.

7165
06:09:31,880 --> 06:09:33,100
I wish that was you right now.

7166
06:09:33,220 --> 06:09:34,400
I wish that was one of you guys.

7167
06:09:35,380 --> 06:09:37,380
I don't even... There's a room over here?

7168
06:09:38,240 --> 06:09:39,360
Where does this lead to?

7169
06:09:44,820 --> 06:09:45,620
An elevator?

7170
06:09:45,900 --> 06:09:46,100
Ok.

7171
06:09:47,620 --> 06:09:48,020
Um...

7172
06:09:49,800 --> 06:09:51,620
This used to be harder, by the way.

7173
06:09:51,620 --> 06:09:52,200
That's insane.

7174
06:10:01,080 --> 06:10:01,440
Ok.

7175
06:10:02,540 --> 06:10:02,900
Ok.

7176
06:10:04,040 --> 06:10:04,680
Oh my god!

7177
06:10:04,700 --> 06:10:05,680
He's all the way over there!

7178
06:10:05,720 --> 06:10:07,460
By the room where we need to be at!

7179
06:10:08,440 --> 06:10:08,800
Go!

7180
06:10:08,820 --> 06:10:09,520
Ok, hold on.

7181
06:10:09,580 --> 06:10:11,020
I can't even figure out how to get around.

7182
06:10:12,680 --> 06:10:13,780
It's up here?

7183
06:10:14,200 --> 06:10:14,840
It's up here?

7184
06:10:15,760 --> 06:10:17,220
Wish you had a soliton radar.

7185
06:10:17,560 --> 06:10:17,780
I know.

7186
06:10:18,860 --> 06:10:19,220
Ok.

7187
06:10:23,060 --> 06:10:23,420
What?

7188
06:10:23,580 --> 06:10:24,500
Can I at least see where...

7189
06:10:24,500 --> 06:10:25,160
No, no!

7190
06:10:25,220 --> 06:10:25,620
Go away!

7191
06:10:25,820 --> 06:10:26,180
Go away!

7192
06:10:27,620 --> 06:10:28,840
Oh my god!

7193
06:10:29,220 --> 06:10:31,700
I think this is where he's usually roaming.

7194
06:10:31,860 --> 06:10:32,880
And I tricked him earlier.

7195
06:10:34,600 --> 06:10:35,040
Maybe?

7196
06:10:35,240 --> 06:10:35,840
I can't tell.

7197
06:10:42,130 --> 06:10:43,010
He's circling.

7198
06:10:43,470 --> 06:10:44,950
I don't know where the other guy is.

7199
06:10:45,090 --> 06:10:45,390
Hold on.

7200
06:10:45,450 --> 06:10:47,150
Let me see where he's at before we continue.

7201
06:10:50,270 --> 06:10:50,710
Sheesh.

7202
06:10:55,860 --> 06:10:56,680
Where is he?

7203
06:11:01,140 --> 06:11:02,580
This is so messed up.

7204
06:11:02,680 --> 06:11:03,180
He's camping!

7205
06:11:06,640 --> 06:11:08,140
I'm gonna have to get through all of this?

7206
06:11:09,180 --> 06:11:10,000
Oh my god.

7207
06:11:10,380 --> 06:11:11,560
There's no way, you guys.

7208
06:11:11,660 --> 06:11:12,100
There's no...

7209
06:11:12,100 --> 06:11:12,740
There's no way.

7210
06:11:14,540 --> 06:11:15,780
There's no way I can do this.

7211
06:11:16,900 --> 06:11:18,320
I don't even know where the other guy is.

7212
06:11:37,120 --> 06:11:38,380
Wait, there's a... what?

7213
06:11:38,660 --> 06:11:39,880
There's a spoiler mode.

7214
06:11:40,020 --> 06:11:40,600
What does that mean?

7215
06:11:40,780 --> 06:11:41,160
What do you mean?

7216
06:11:46,930 --> 06:11:48,090
Is there a bridge over here?

7217
06:11:48,190 --> 06:11:48,930
Oh, in the darkness.

7218
06:11:48,930 --> 06:11:50,850
Oh, so they're both on the bridge, maybe?

7219
06:11:51,330 --> 06:11:51,790
You think?

7220
06:11:53,910 --> 06:11:54,850
No, I don't think so.

7221
06:11:55,610 --> 06:11:57,150
Oh, he went down here, I think.

7222
06:11:59,410 --> 06:12:00,670
I think maybe he's...

7223
06:12:03,350 --> 06:12:04,970
I see someone over there.

7224
06:12:06,550 --> 06:12:08,170
I don't know what he's doing.

7225
06:12:11,310 --> 06:12:11,950
Oh, gosh.

7226
06:12:12,110 --> 06:12:12,630
Oh, gosh.

7227
06:12:12,670 --> 06:12:13,070
Oh, gosh.

7228
06:12:13,090 --> 06:12:13,490
Oh, gosh.

7229
06:12:13,550 --> 06:12:13,910
Oh, gosh.

7230
06:12:14,010 --> 06:12:14,390
Oh, gosh.

7231
06:12:21,710 --> 06:12:23,110
I don't see him there now.

7232
06:12:25,630 --> 06:12:26,830
This is...

7233
06:12:26,830 --> 06:12:28,610
This is...

7234
06:12:29,810 --> 06:12:30,270
Already?

7235
06:12:39,130 --> 06:12:40,190
Where at?

7236
06:12:42,030 --> 06:12:42,650
Where at?

7237
06:12:44,330 --> 06:12:46,210
I'm just gonna go...

7238
06:12:48,030 --> 06:12:49,690
Until I can hear no more.

7239
06:12:50,690 --> 06:12:51,610
Okay.

7240
06:13:00,820 --> 06:13:01,260
What

7241
06:13:20,480 --> 06:13:20,820
the hell?

7242
06:13:20,900 --> 06:13:22,220
Why am I stuck on the stairs?

7243
06:13:23,880 --> 06:13:25,080
What am I stuck on?

7244
06:13:25,800 --> 06:13:26,240
Actually...

7245
06:13:26,960 --> 06:13:28,300
What am I stuck on?

7246
06:13:29,380 --> 06:13:30,260
I'm stuck!

7247
06:13:30,360 --> 06:13:31,000
You can't get me!

7248
06:13:32,420 --> 06:13:37,380
Can I outrun them?

7249
06:13:42,060 --> 06:13:42,720
Oh, shit!

7250
06:13:42,720 --> 06:13:42,940
Wait.

7251
06:13:43,120 --> 06:13:43,760
Oh, wait.

7252
06:13:43,820 --> 06:13:44,660
No, I'm going the right way.

7253
06:14:00,510 --> 06:14:01,430
How did...

7254
06:14:01,430 --> 06:14:03,350
How did I manage to get so lucky?

7255
06:14:06,110 --> 06:14:08,330
How did I manage to get so lucky?

7256
06:14:09,790 --> 06:14:10,250
Wait,

7257
06:14:14,310 --> 06:14:14,730
but...

7258
06:14:14,730 --> 06:14:17,290
Do I have enough time to explore this area?

7259
06:14:17,770 --> 06:14:19,070
Is the bigger question.

7260
06:14:28,080 --> 06:14:29,020
Okay, there's a lot here.

7261
06:14:29,220 --> 06:14:31,280
Let's keep... Let's get this ball rolling.

7262
06:14:31,740 --> 06:14:33,080
Wait, I can't see.

7263
06:14:33,220 --> 06:14:34,080
Actually, wait.

7264
06:14:34,320 --> 06:14:35,180
Drop, slide...

7265
06:14:35,180 --> 06:14:35,780
No, no, no.

7266
06:14:35,880 --> 06:14:36,380
Here we go.

7267
06:14:37,420 --> 06:14:38,140
There we go!

7268
06:14:38,340 --> 06:14:38,960
Here we go!

7269
06:14:40,120 --> 06:14:40,500
Insert!

7270
06:14:40,500 --> 06:14:41,100
Here we go!

7271
06:14:41,120 --> 06:14:41,460
Here we go!

7272
06:14:41,460 --> 06:14:41,740
Here we go!

7273
06:14:42,540 --> 06:14:42,920
Yes!

7274
06:14:44,140 --> 06:14:45,300
XE, thanks for the tech gifted!

7275
06:14:46,460 --> 06:14:46,840
Okay.

7276
06:14:48,420 --> 06:14:48,960
The eye!

7277
06:14:50,080 --> 06:14:50,900
They're like, yes!

7278
06:14:51,500 --> 06:14:53,280
We love the eye!

7279
06:14:54,060 --> 06:14:55,260
Eye is my favorite thing.

7280
06:14:55,440 --> 06:14:55,860
Just kidding.

7281
06:14:56,140 --> 06:14:57,740
Eye will destroy the universe.

7282
06:14:58,080 --> 06:14:58,460
Crush...

7283
06:14:58,460 --> 06:14:59,760
They will destroy all our planets.

7284
06:15:00,020 --> 06:15:01,200
It will even destroy me.

7285
06:15:01,280 --> 06:15:02,520
I will just become bone.

7286
06:15:04,320 --> 06:15:05,880
A new life will happen.

7287
06:15:06,120 --> 06:15:06,740
Oh my god!

7288
06:15:07,000 --> 06:15:07,460
No!

7289
06:15:07,620 --> 06:15:08,320
The eye sucks!

7290
06:15:08,520 --> 06:15:09,260
We hate the eye.

7291
06:15:09,420 --> 06:15:10,000
Eye sucks.

7292
06:15:10,220 --> 06:15:10,800
Burn the eye!

7293
06:15:11,320 --> 06:15:12,660
Eye is the worst thing ever.

7294
06:15:14,660 --> 06:15:15,480
Oh, build?

7295
06:15:23,380 --> 06:15:25,780
A thing to trap the eye.

7296
06:15:45,830 --> 06:15:46,350
Okay.

7297
06:15:47,570 --> 06:15:48,090
Huh?

7298
06:15:53,370 --> 06:15:55,030
Put the used ones here.

7299
06:16:02,030 --> 06:16:02,470
Okay.

7300
06:16:03,970 --> 06:16:05,030
Eye is cancelled.

7301
06:16:06,810 --> 06:16:07,690
So, yeah.

7302
06:16:07,750 --> 06:16:09,290
They blocked the signal of the eye.

7303
06:16:09,570 --> 06:16:10,850
It was like doing its thing.

7304
06:16:11,070 --> 06:16:12,050
And then they were like, no, no, no, no.

7305
06:16:12,110 --> 06:16:13,010
We don't care about you anymore.

7306
06:16:17,050 --> 06:16:18,590
Oh, bing-bong, bing-bong.

7307
06:16:20,170 --> 06:16:23,330
Oh, brain says, time to awaken.

7308
06:16:24,050 --> 06:16:25,470
Oh, bing-bong, bing-bong.

7309
06:16:25,490 --> 06:16:26,610
Oh, bing-bong, bing-bong.

7310
06:16:27,350 --> 06:16:28,250
Oh my god.

7311
06:16:28,850 --> 06:16:29,530
He's dead!

7312
06:16:31,970 --> 06:16:33,270
Bing-bong, bing-bong.

7313
06:16:33,290 --> 06:16:34,070
Everybody wake up.

7314
06:16:34,510 --> 06:16:36,330
No signal then.

7315
06:16:36,710 --> 06:16:37,750
They stay.

7316
06:16:38,610 --> 06:16:40,350
That's why they're not waking up.

7317
06:16:43,490 --> 06:16:44,050
Okay.

7318
06:16:44,190 --> 06:16:45,510
That makes sense.

7319
06:16:46,550 --> 06:16:48,110
That's why they're not waking up.

7320
06:16:50,510 --> 06:16:51,530
There's no...

7321
06:16:52,630 --> 06:16:54,490
No activity up there.

7322
06:16:57,970 --> 06:16:59,730
He's just like, me for real, for real.

7323
06:17:01,810 --> 06:17:04,630
There's not a single thought of...

7324
06:17:08,530 --> 06:17:09,010
Brain.

7325
06:17:09,950 --> 06:17:11,250
Too much brain rot?

7326
06:17:11,490 --> 06:17:12,470
Oh, this is literally me.

7327
06:17:12,910 --> 06:17:13,790
Okay, brain.

7328
06:17:15,890 --> 06:17:16,810
The brain.

7329
06:17:17,370 --> 06:17:18,430
You go in here.

7330
06:17:20,250 --> 06:17:21,830
And it monitors your brain.

7331
06:17:23,150 --> 06:17:23,810
Brain good.

7332
06:17:24,050 --> 06:17:25,310
Brain not so good.

7333
06:17:27,510 --> 06:17:28,610
Oh, you're asleep.

7334
06:17:28,770 --> 06:17:29,290
You're in the game.

7335
06:17:29,310 --> 06:17:30,810
You're playing Sword Art Online?

7336
06:17:32,130 --> 06:17:33,330
Oh, yes, grandpa.

7337
06:17:35,330 --> 06:17:36,190
Oh, they're like...

7338
06:17:36,190 --> 06:17:37,070
Oh my god, grandpa!

7339
06:17:38,450 --> 06:17:39,430
No, no, no, no.

7340
06:17:40,470 --> 06:17:41,510
Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa.

7341
06:17:43,730 --> 06:17:45,150
No brain activity.

7342
06:17:46,390 --> 06:17:47,150
Literally me.

7343
06:17:50,690 --> 06:17:51,910
Oh, but he made it.

7344
06:17:52,210 --> 06:17:52,930
Because he...

7345
06:17:54,210 --> 06:17:54,950
Fell asleep.

7346
06:17:56,850 --> 06:17:57,090
No sleep.

7347
06:17:57,630 --> 06:17:58,490
He's like...

7348
06:17:58,490 --> 06:18:02,110
I like the music here.

7349
06:18:02,950 --> 06:18:03,990
I'm grandpa!

7350
06:18:06,630 --> 06:18:07,330
Grandpa lived!

7351
06:18:07,510 --> 06:18:08,750
He's in the game.

7352
06:18:12,690 --> 06:18:13,750
What else is...

7353
06:18:13,750 --> 06:18:14,070
Oh, here.

7354
06:18:16,530 --> 06:18:17,590
Oh, come on.

7355
06:18:18,510 --> 06:18:19,150
You...

7356
06:18:20,550 --> 06:18:20,870
You!

7357
06:18:22,610 --> 06:18:23,890
Gonna drop the artifact here.

7358
06:18:24,070 --> 06:18:25,190
Gonna walk away.

7359
06:18:26,850 --> 06:18:27,850
Gonna go into the game world now.

7360
06:18:28,210 --> 06:18:28,770
Now.

7361
06:18:30,510 --> 06:18:32,610
What else can we see in here?

7362
06:18:33,510 --> 06:18:34,070
Well...

7363
06:18:34,070 --> 06:18:35,250
Not much.

7364
06:18:35,390 --> 06:18:35,690
Hold on.

7365
06:18:36,470 --> 06:18:38,010
Oh, I need that.

7366
06:18:38,190 --> 06:18:40,070
I need to actually...

7367
06:18:40,970 --> 06:18:41,670
Let's see.

7368
06:18:43,190 --> 06:18:43,750
Okay.

7369
06:18:45,790 --> 06:18:47,550
We need to open that up.

7370
06:18:50,150 --> 06:18:52,070
There's more... here.

7371
06:18:54,650 --> 06:18:56,290
I can't extinguish these.

7372
06:18:56,450 --> 06:18:56,830
Because I'm...

7373
06:18:56,830 --> 06:18:58,390
I'm a stupid alien.

7374
06:19:01,790 --> 06:19:02,270
Hmm...

7375
06:19:03,030 --> 06:19:03,950
So that's it?

7376
06:19:07,400 --> 06:19:08,160
That was it?

7377
06:19:08,840 --> 06:19:09,980
We got everything here?

7378
06:19:10,540 --> 06:19:11,180
I think?

7379
06:19:16,780 --> 06:19:17,780
Got what you needed?

7380
06:19:18,000 --> 06:19:18,540
Okay, cool.

7381
06:19:19,740 --> 06:19:21,260
Oh, we did it, you guys!

7382
06:19:21,340 --> 06:19:21,940
We did it!

7383
06:19:22,340 --> 06:19:23,380
I'm so relieved.

7384
06:19:23,380 --> 06:19:25,380
Oh, man.

7385
06:19:26,260 --> 06:19:27,580
I'm so relieved right now.

7386
06:19:28,200 --> 06:19:29,100
Holy moly.

7387
06:19:29,160 --> 06:19:30,440
Okay, that means just one more.

7388
06:19:30,540 --> 06:19:33,320
And then we figure out what the heck is going on with these.

7389
06:19:37,640 --> 06:19:38,600
Holy cow.

7390
06:19:40,680 --> 06:19:41,160
Um...

7391
06:19:42,020 --> 06:19:43,040
I guess I'll die?

7392
06:19:50,940 --> 06:19:51,420
Okay.

7393
06:19:57,460 --> 06:19:57,800
Oh...

7394
06:19:57,800 --> 06:20:00,760
You guys have no brain.

7395
06:20:07,600 --> 06:20:09,280
Ah, brainless, stupid.

7396
06:20:09,600 --> 06:20:10,480
No activity.

7397
06:20:10,620 --> 06:20:11,960
Nothing going on up there.

7398
06:20:12,160 --> 06:20:14,920
You wish you could have a single thought.

7399
06:20:14,980 --> 06:20:15,920
But you can't.

7400
06:20:15,920 --> 06:20:18,480
You have no thoughts, no thoughts, no thoughts.

7401
06:20:21,080 --> 06:20:22,420
This one's for me.

7402
06:20:22,520 --> 06:20:23,960
I wanna have no thoughts too.

7403
06:20:25,140 --> 06:20:25,780
Alright.

7404
06:20:28,080 --> 06:20:28,640
Um...

7405
06:20:29,320 --> 06:20:30,220
I'm gonna go make food.

7406
06:20:31,460 --> 06:20:32,580
And, um...

7407
06:20:36,360 --> 06:20:37,480
And, um...

7408
06:20:39,840 --> 06:20:41,340
I'm going to...

7409
06:20:41,340 --> 06:20:44,680
Then we'll do the last one, which was the house...

7410
06:20:46,120 --> 06:20:46,680
there?

7411
06:20:51,080 --> 06:20:52,800
I'm nervous though that...

7412
06:20:53,900 --> 06:20:54,460
Um...

7413
06:20:57,580 --> 06:20:59,460
I'm nervous though that...

7414
06:21:00,600 --> 06:21:01,420
Good night, Minto.

7415
06:21:01,520 --> 06:21:02,020
Thanks for streaming.

7416
06:21:02,140 --> 06:21:02,460
Good night!

7417
06:21:04,020 --> 06:21:04,960
I'm still streaming.

7418
06:21:05,120 --> 06:21:06,740
Don't worry if you guys...

7419
06:21:07,320 --> 06:21:08,680
I'm still gonna be here.

7420
06:21:09,920 --> 06:21:11,280
I'm still standing.

7421
06:21:13,960 --> 06:21:15,520
I'm nervous about the next one though.

7422
06:21:15,560 --> 06:21:17,220
Because it seems more difficult.

7423
06:21:17,500 --> 06:21:19,320
But maybe it's not...

7424
06:21:19,320 --> 06:21:20,840
Maybe it's okay.

7425
06:21:21,040 --> 06:21:21,780
I don't know.

7426
06:21:21,860 --> 06:21:22,320
We'll see.

7427
06:21:24,660 --> 06:21:25,540
Back from food.

7428
06:21:25,540 --> 06:21:26,220
What did I miss?

7429
06:21:26,620 --> 06:21:28,500
Jeffrey, I finally did it.

7430
06:21:29,520 --> 06:21:30,520
I finally... Jeffrey!

7431
06:21:31,000 --> 06:21:32,460
You put me through hell, man.

7432
06:21:37,680 --> 06:21:39,420
I think this one is the most difficult.

7433
06:21:39,560 --> 06:21:40,660
Wait, the one we just did?

7434
06:21:40,840 --> 06:21:42,320
Or the one that we're about to do?

7435
06:21:42,540 --> 06:21:44,440
Because I sure hope it's the one we just did.

7436
06:21:45,300 --> 06:21:46,840
Oh yeah, I was pretty mad at you, Jeffrey.

7437
06:21:46,920 --> 06:21:47,440
I'm not gonna lie.

7438
06:21:56,660 --> 06:21:58,120
Oh, the next one is the easiest one.

7439
06:21:58,200 --> 06:21:59,740
Oh, okay.

7440
06:21:59,860 --> 06:22:00,180
Good.

7441
06:22:00,280 --> 06:22:02,960
I'm glad to get the harder ones out of the way then.

7442
06:22:02,960 --> 06:22:03,840
Because...

7443
06:22:04,980 --> 06:22:06,020
Forbidden Archive.

7444
06:22:06,140 --> 06:22:06,420
Wow!

7445
06:22:06,880 --> 06:22:10,000
A library full of intact slide reels hidden deep underground.

7446
06:22:10,340 --> 06:22:12,440
There's a container marked with one of the vault seals.

7447
06:22:12,800 --> 06:22:13,520
Blah, blah, blah.

7448
06:22:13,740 --> 06:22:14,340
It's been destroyed.

7449
06:22:14,620 --> 06:22:18,100
I found a slide reel that shows the stranger's inhabitants analyzing the eye of the universe.

7450
06:22:18,320 --> 06:22:23,160
Intact slides reveal the construction and launch of a spacecraft designed to block the eye's signal.

7451
06:22:23,460 --> 06:22:23,580
Reveal the construction and launch of a spacecraft designed to block the eye's signal.

7452
06:22:23,580 --> 06:22:23,600
Yeah.

7453
06:22:25,880 --> 06:22:27,300
What do I do?

7454
06:22:27,480 --> 06:22:27,740
What?

7455
06:22:28,480 --> 06:22:29,000
Hmm.

7456
06:22:29,000 --> 06:22:33,680
I found a slide reel that shows two artifacts being lit near a green fire...

7457
06:22:33,680 --> 06:22:33,800
Wait.

7458
06:22:33,900 --> 06:22:35,340
Are we gonna have to do something like...

7459
06:22:36,300 --> 06:22:39,660
...Destroy the craft that's blocking the eye's signal?

7460
06:22:40,100 --> 06:22:40,860
I wonder.

7461
06:22:41,560 --> 06:22:44,340
I found a slide reel that shows two artifacts being lit near a green fire.

7462
06:22:44,580 --> 06:22:47,340
The first artifact lights after it's bearer falls asleep.

7463
06:22:47,460 --> 06:22:49,640
and the second artifact lights after the bearer dies.

7464
06:22:50,920 --> 06:22:55,220
I found a slide reel that appears to be some sort of error report.

7465
06:22:55,400 --> 06:22:57,860
It shows an alarm bell failing to wake up the stranger's inhabitants.

7466
06:23:07,080 --> 06:23:07,480
Okay.

7467
06:23:08,240 --> 06:23:13,580
I'm gonna let you guys listen to the music while I go get some...

7468
06:23:13,580 --> 06:23:18,160
We're going back to the... I think this is the first time I've ever taken the lift down.

7469
06:23:18,380 --> 06:23:19,520
Now that I think about it.

7470
06:23:19,980 --> 06:23:22,440
I'm gonna give you some of this ASMR.

7471
06:23:23,020 --> 06:23:24,220
I'm gonna get food real quick.

7472
06:23:26,700 --> 06:23:27,800
Real, real quick.

7473
06:23:27,880 --> 06:23:28,540
Real, real quick.

7474
06:23:28,540 --> 06:23:28,540
Real, real quick.

7475
06:23:30,920 --> 06:23:32,240
And I'll be back.

7476
06:23:33,200 --> 06:23:36,960
Once I... Once I have some food.

7477
06:23:38,370 --> 06:23:38,800
Okay.

7478
06:23:38,900 --> 06:23:39,420
Barely.

7479
06:30:05,220 --> 06:30:07,120
I'm back with food!

7480
06:30:07,780 --> 06:30:08,420
Yippee!

7481
06:30:10,000 --> 06:30:11,120
Yippee, yippee!

7482
06:30:18,260 --> 06:30:18,940
Okay.

7483
06:30:18,940 --> 06:30:20,720
Food break, everybody.

7484
06:30:21,420 --> 06:30:22,480
Food break.

7485
06:30:22,540 --> 06:30:23,000
Dinner break.

7486
06:30:23,200 --> 06:30:23,700
Scatter.

7487
06:30:23,860 --> 06:30:24,040
No!

7488
06:30:25,140 --> 06:30:26,160
Don't leave!

7489
06:30:27,660 --> 06:30:28,800
Don't leave!

7490
06:30:30,220 --> 06:30:33,000
I'm checking my notifications.

7491
06:30:33,200 --> 06:30:40,280
If I'm ever midstream and you guys see that the Delta Collector's Edition goes on sale somewhere...

7492
06:30:40,280 --> 06:30:41,100
Will you guys let me know?

7493
06:30:45,480 --> 06:30:47,080
Tempted to grab some mallows.

7494
06:30:47,640 --> 06:30:48,620
I know, right?

7495
06:30:49,460 --> 06:30:51,000
I bought a, like...

7496
06:30:52,240 --> 06:30:53,360
A portable...

7497
06:30:55,360 --> 06:30:55,920
Marshmallow.

7498
06:30:55,980 --> 06:30:57,760
It's really like a portable fire.

7499
06:30:59,360 --> 06:31:02,060
But it's intended uses for marshmallows.

7500
06:31:03,000 --> 06:31:04,380
And you get some stuff.

7501
06:31:04,560 --> 06:31:05,680
Like some starter.

7502
06:31:06,240 --> 06:31:07,400
And you pour it in the center.

7503
06:31:07,840 --> 06:31:09,440
And then... Cause I always...

7504
06:31:09,440 --> 06:31:10,600
I had like a...

7505
06:31:11,540 --> 06:31:14,720
My favorite thing about marshmallows is how...

7506
06:31:14,720 --> 06:31:15,500
When they get toasty.

7507
06:31:16,460 --> 06:31:16,920
So...

7508
06:31:17,600 --> 06:31:19,420
Like they have to be set on fire.

7509
06:31:19,480 --> 06:31:20,140
You know what I mean?

7510
06:31:24,820 --> 06:31:25,280
And...

7511
06:31:29,160 --> 06:31:30,060
And so...

7512
06:31:30,060 --> 06:31:31,340
I got that.

7513
06:31:32,920 --> 06:31:33,840
And um...

7514
06:31:33,840 --> 06:31:36,960
Cause I originally bought... I really like... I don't know.

7515
06:31:37,040 --> 06:31:39,260
Maybe I just really like toasted marshmallows.

7516
06:31:39,940 --> 06:31:41,240
Because I had bought one before.

7517
06:31:41,580 --> 06:31:43,580
But it only like heated it up, you know?

7518
06:31:43,580 --> 06:31:44,720
So it still made it gooey.

7519
06:31:44,780 --> 06:31:45,640
But I like the crunchy.

7520
06:31:48,800 --> 06:31:50,660
It only made it kinda gooey.

7521
06:31:52,400 --> 06:31:54,260
But I love burnt marshmallow.

7522
06:31:55,000 --> 06:31:55,520
So...

7523
06:31:58,400 --> 06:31:58,920
Crunchy.

7524
06:31:58,920 --> 06:31:59,100
Yeah!

7525
06:31:59,280 --> 06:32:01,700
When they have the crunch on the outside.

7526
06:32:01,880 --> 06:32:03,660
And then you can peel off the skin.

7527
06:32:04,180 --> 06:32:06,020
And then you can eat the burnt skin.

7528
06:32:10,480 --> 06:32:11,440
So good.

7529
06:32:21,410 --> 06:32:22,430
Crunchier-blush... yeah!

7530
06:32:25,910 --> 06:32:26,630
I'm jealous.

7531
06:32:26,750 --> 06:32:27,390
I want S'mores.

7532
06:32:27,530 --> 06:32:28,410
I don't have them right now.

7533
06:32:32,530 --> 06:32:33,310
Two words.

7534
06:32:33,490 --> 06:32:34,170
Toaster oven.

7535
06:32:34,790 --> 06:32:36,850
Yeah but... Then I want to put this on the stick, myself.

7536
06:32:38,050 --> 06:32:40,070
Like I want to be able to roast it myself.

7537
06:32:43,650 --> 06:32:45,250
It brings out my child.

7538
06:32:51,120 --> 06:32:52,840
It makes me go, here look!

7539
06:32:52,960 --> 06:32:53,580
Come here, child!

7540
06:32:54,820 --> 06:32:55,500
Come on out!

7541
06:32:57,920 --> 06:32:59,840
I miss making s'mores with my friends.

7542
06:33:02,080 --> 06:33:03,700
If you miss it, then you should do it!

7543
06:33:04,240 --> 06:33:05,960
Say, hey guys, today we're making s'mores.

7544
06:33:10,180 --> 06:33:12,940
You get marshmallows in the shape of squares.

7545
06:33:14,400 --> 06:33:16,220
No, I normally just get the normal marshmallow.

7546
06:33:21,120 --> 06:33:22,060
Have a child!

7547
06:33:22,280 --> 06:33:23,480
Let me on the raft!

7548
06:33:25,020 --> 06:33:26,220
Never had s'mores?

7549
06:33:27,920 --> 06:33:31,800
I'll be honest, I like just the burnt marshmallow more than the s'more.

7550
06:33:33,080 --> 06:33:35,210
Usually, if I have an option for s'mores...

7551
06:33:37,320 --> 06:33:40,240
Because with like the graham cracker and stuff, you're gonna get full more.

7552
06:33:41,720 --> 06:33:42,180
So...

7553
06:33:45,040 --> 06:33:46,880
So I just eat the marshmallow.

7554
06:33:59,090 --> 06:34:00,550
I seem like the type what?

7555
06:34:02,630 --> 06:34:03,530
What does that mean?

7556
06:34:03,710 --> 06:34:04,970
Just a s'more, then.

7557
06:34:06,670 --> 06:34:07,590
Just the mo.

7558
06:34:07,830 --> 06:34:08,630
The marshmallow.

7559
06:34:09,050 --> 06:34:09,490
The mo.

7560
06:34:10,050 --> 06:34:11,930
Please stop eating burnt marshmallows.

7561
06:34:12,030 --> 06:34:13,010
I'm not it!

7562
06:34:13,030 --> 06:34:13,610
What do you mean?

7563
06:34:16,170 --> 06:34:17,650
You can't stop me!

7564
06:34:24,320 --> 06:34:25,800
This is such an awesome view.

7565
06:34:46,660 --> 06:34:48,160
That's not the sun at all.

7566
06:34:48,420 --> 06:34:49,400
That's um...

7567
06:34:50,420 --> 06:34:51,400
That's Brittle Hollow.

7568
06:34:52,340 --> 06:34:53,440
That's not the sun.

7569
06:34:53,780 --> 06:34:56,420
Look at all those stars in the distance.

7570
06:34:57,460 --> 06:34:58,060
Bursting though.

7571
06:34:59,680 --> 06:35:00,120
Hmm...

7572
06:35:01,860 --> 06:35:02,480
But yeah.

7573
06:35:02,580 --> 06:35:03,120
How are you guys?

7574
06:35:03,320 --> 06:35:03,960
What day is it?

7575
06:35:04,200 --> 06:35:04,640
Tuesday?

7576
06:35:06,420 --> 06:35:08,240
Do you have any fun plans this weekend?

7577
06:35:08,660 --> 06:35:09,220
Who's going?

7578
06:35:09,320 --> 06:35:10,860
Is anybody going to Anime Expo?

7579
06:35:14,880 --> 06:35:15,900
I have a concert.

7580
06:35:16,020 --> 06:35:17,360
It's not at Anime Expo.

7581
06:35:18,260 --> 06:35:20,100
But it's during Anime Expo.

7582
06:35:20,700 --> 06:35:25,020
But it's during Anime Expo.

7583
06:35:25,080 --> 06:35:26,960
Oh, that's Giant's Deep.

7584
06:35:27,800 --> 06:35:28,640
Just kidding.

7585
06:35:31,940 --> 06:35:33,580
Hold on one second.

7586
06:35:34,730 --> 06:35:35,260
There we go.

7587
06:35:36,520 --> 06:35:37,640
Too far away?

7588
06:35:37,960 --> 06:35:38,820
That's okay.

7589
06:35:39,360 --> 06:35:40,600
AX is overrated.

7590
06:35:42,820 --> 06:35:44,200
AX is overrated.

7591
06:35:44,940 --> 06:35:46,420
Nah, it's uh...

7592
06:35:48,000 --> 06:35:49,780
Like, even for me, I'm just like...

7593
06:35:49,780 --> 06:35:50,760
I don't know how people...

7594
06:35:52,000 --> 06:35:52,660
do stuff.

7595
06:35:52,860 --> 06:35:54,260
I feel like everything needs to be ticketed.

7596
06:35:54,340 --> 06:36:00,560
And like, I would feel less pressure if everything was, one, ticketed, and two, the tickets were given out before the convention.

7597
06:36:00,880 --> 06:36:01,720
You know what I mean?

7598
06:36:06,720 --> 06:36:08,180
Because it's just so busy.

7599
06:36:09,400 --> 06:36:12,160
And there's so much that's not ticketed.

7600
06:36:12,200 --> 06:36:14,180
And what I mean is like, the events and stuff.

7601
06:36:14,200 --> 06:36:15,800
Like, autographs.

7602
06:36:15,800 --> 06:36:17,700
Like, if you applied online and got everything.

7603
06:36:20,840 --> 06:36:22,900
There's... the lines are insane.

7604
06:36:23,900 --> 06:36:26,240
There's... there's... it's like almost impossible.

7605
06:36:26,300 --> 06:36:30,760
You have to pick, like, one thing that you really want to do, and that's basically your weekend.

7606
06:36:31,740 --> 06:36:32,560
Misty's talks.

7607
06:36:32,820 --> 06:36:33,620
Thanks, Minty.

7608
06:36:37,660 --> 06:36:41,700
But like, the amount of guests that are gonna be there this year that I...

7609
06:36:41,700 --> 06:36:43,460
that I have an interest in, I'm like...

7610
06:36:46,220 --> 06:36:47,220
I wish...

7611
06:36:47,220 --> 06:36:48,520
I wish...

7612
06:36:50,320 --> 06:36:50,820
I...

7613
06:36:50,820 --> 06:36:51,600
Like, I'm gonna be there.

7614
06:36:51,740 --> 06:36:52,920
Because I'm gonna be there for the concert.

7615
06:36:54,200 --> 06:36:55,200
But... it's...

7616
06:36:56,320 --> 06:36:58,340
And then the lines on the summer heat...

7617
06:36:58,340 --> 06:36:58,500
Yeah!

7618
06:36:58,660 --> 06:36:59,380
It's awful!

7619
06:37:06,870 --> 06:37:09,350
What I mostly plan on going to do...

7620
06:37:09,350 --> 06:37:10,750
is like...

7621
06:37:11,670 --> 06:37:13,170
is like marketing...

7622
06:37:13,170 --> 06:37:13,730
myself.

7623
06:37:17,840 --> 06:37:19,260
I wanna go to companies.

7624
06:37:20,060 --> 06:37:20,540
Like...

7625
06:37:20,540 --> 06:37:22,620
The Blue Archive booth and be like, Hi.

7626
06:37:23,280 --> 06:37:25,080
Um, have you heard of Mint Phantom?

7627
06:37:26,740 --> 06:37:29,560
So I'm gonna basically only be there to be hustling.

7628
06:37:31,380 --> 06:37:32,080
Mm-hmm.

7629
06:37:34,980 --> 06:37:36,000
We're all networking.

7630
06:37:37,980 --> 06:37:39,800
I think there's like an industry...

7631
06:37:39,800 --> 06:37:41,680
There's... these conventions usually...

7632
06:37:41,680 --> 06:37:43,160
I mean, most conventions...

7633
06:37:43,160 --> 06:37:45,240
Um, have an industry party.

7634
06:37:46,540 --> 06:37:48,260
But I think the concert is...

7635
06:37:50,020 --> 06:37:50,680
I don't know.

7636
06:37:50,820 --> 06:37:53,120
I don't wanna do like anything before the concert.

7637
06:37:54,260 --> 06:37:55,520
Because I don't wanna...

7638
06:37:55,520 --> 06:37:56,540
risk it, you know?

7639
06:37:56,940 --> 06:37:57,600
Mm-hmm.

7640
06:37:59,500 --> 06:38:00,680
She's on the grind set.

7641
06:38:01,020 --> 06:38:02,000
I have to be!

7642
06:38:02,160 --> 06:38:03,560
It's just me, myself, and I!

7643
06:38:04,700 --> 06:38:05,480
If I'm...

7644
06:38:05,480 --> 06:38:07,420
If I'm not gonna do it, nobody's gonna do it.

7645
06:38:16,500 --> 06:38:17,300
Oh, uh-oh.

7646
06:38:18,980 --> 06:38:19,920
That was my controller.

7647
06:38:24,630 --> 06:38:25,490
We're all good.

7648
06:38:25,610 --> 06:38:26,050
Yay!

7649
06:38:26,710 --> 06:38:27,770
We get a song!

7650
06:38:39,260 --> 06:38:40,740
Window 10 user?

7651
06:38:43,680 --> 06:38:44,240
Wait.

7652
06:38:45,460 --> 06:38:47,520
Is there a different sound for Windows 11?

7653
06:38:48,520 --> 06:38:49,700
I've never heard it.

7654
06:39:07,980 --> 06:39:09,600
You should never hear it.

7655
06:39:10,480 --> 06:39:12,580
I have Windows 11 for my laptop.

7656
06:39:13,760 --> 06:39:15,000
Not by choice, obviously.

7657
06:39:17,840 --> 06:39:18,280
Not by choice, obviously.

7658
06:39:18,280 --> 06:39:19,220
I don't like it.

7659
06:39:21,820 --> 06:39:23,220
I don't like it at all.

7660
06:39:23,440 --> 06:39:23,600
I don't like it at all.

7661
06:39:23,600 --> 06:39:23,860
But...

7662
06:39:24,660 --> 06:39:26,000
I still use Windows 7.

7663
06:39:26,060 --> 06:39:27,380
Windows 7 was the GOAT.

7664
06:39:27,740 --> 06:39:28,180
I still use Windows 7.

7665
06:39:28,180 --> 06:39:28,180
Windows 7 was the GOAT.

7666
06:39:35,370 --> 06:39:36,150
I got...

7667
06:39:36,150 --> 06:39:38,430
It did the whole thing where it was like...

7668
06:39:40,870 --> 06:39:41,310
Um...

7669
06:39:41,310 --> 06:39:43,350
It keeps being like...

7670
06:39:43,350 --> 06:39:43,910
Oh, by the way!

7671
06:39:44,470 --> 06:39:45,450
Microsoft AI!

7672
06:39:45,870 --> 06:39:47,030
I'm like, please stop!

7673
06:39:48,030 --> 06:39:48,750
Please, Yamato!

7674
06:39:53,220 --> 06:39:53,820
The sun!

7675
06:39:54,120 --> 06:39:55,140
Praise the sun!

7676
06:39:55,700 --> 06:39:56,860
Don't look into the sun, you guys.

7677
06:40:02,610 --> 06:40:03,470
Don't look into the sun.

7678
06:40:03,550 --> 06:40:04,250
I can look into the sun.

7679
06:40:04,270 --> 06:40:04,930
I have ghost eyes.

7680
06:40:08,670 --> 06:40:09,490
Don't look into the sun.

7681
06:40:12,520 --> 06:40:12,960
Keeps looking.

7682
06:40:15,660 --> 06:40:16,540
What did you say?

7683
06:40:16,620 --> 06:40:17,220
I can't see!

7684
06:40:17,760 --> 06:40:18,360
Oh no!

7685
06:40:18,420 --> 06:40:19,160
We lost one!

7686
06:40:24,940 --> 06:40:25,380
Woah...

7687
06:40:28,930 --> 06:40:30,590
It looks like a giant...

7688
06:40:31,890 --> 06:40:32,730
Like cell.

7689
06:40:33,390 --> 06:40:35,630
Like it could split into two in any second.

7690
06:40:35,870 --> 06:40:36,010
You know?

7691
06:40:38,230 --> 06:40:39,150
That's what it looks like.

7692
06:40:39,210 --> 06:40:39,970
Oh, there's giant state.

7693
06:40:42,530 --> 06:40:42,970
Wait.

7694
06:40:43,790 --> 06:40:45,210
No, this is giant state.

7695
06:40:45,370 --> 06:40:46,030
That's giant state.

7696
06:40:46,590 --> 06:40:48,830
I was right about Brittle Hollow, was I not?

7697
06:40:49,650 --> 06:40:50,550
Or did I not?

7698
06:40:50,550 --> 06:40:50,810
Wait.

7699
06:40:51,450 --> 06:40:52,950
I can't remember anything anymore.

7700
06:40:54,030 --> 06:40:55,610
I'm almost done with my food, by the way, guys.

7701
06:40:55,650 --> 06:40:55,970
Don't worry.

7702
06:40:58,610 --> 06:40:59,350
I'm almost done.

7703
06:41:00,370 --> 06:41:01,190
I'm eating fast.

7704
06:41:06,540 --> 06:41:07,220
That was right.

7705
06:41:11,720 --> 06:41:12,720
That's the stranger.

7706
06:41:15,960 --> 06:41:17,640
Down by the river, stuck in my head all day.

7707
06:41:21,400 --> 06:41:22,560
I feel like...

7708
06:41:22,560 --> 06:41:23,280
Oh my gosh.

7709
06:41:23,340 --> 06:41:24,620
If they ever release...

7710
06:41:25,800 --> 06:41:26,200
A...

7711
06:41:28,640 --> 06:41:29,700
Like a super...

7712
06:41:29,700 --> 06:41:30,100
Okay, Jeffrey.

7713
06:41:30,820 --> 06:41:31,980
I'm pitching this to you.

7714
06:41:32,640 --> 06:41:33,640
If you're still here.

7715
06:41:34,880 --> 06:41:36,900
A VR version of this game.

7716
06:41:37,920 --> 06:41:39,040
And it doesn't have to be...

7717
06:41:39,040 --> 06:41:40,440
But it doesn't have to be like the full game.

7718
06:41:40,720 --> 06:41:41,500
Just like...

7719
06:41:42,040 --> 06:41:43,160
Just like very minimal.

7720
06:41:43,160 --> 06:41:44,560
I actually looked it up.

7721
06:41:44,640 --> 06:41:45,440
Like in...

7722
06:41:45,440 --> 06:41:45,880
What's it called?

7723
06:41:46,160 --> 06:41:47,180
In VR chat.

7724
06:41:47,320 --> 06:41:49,300
If there were any Outer Wilds worlds.

7725
06:41:51,320 --> 06:41:52,900
And there are actually.

7726
06:41:56,870 --> 06:41:57,630
There's a mod?

7727
06:41:57,710 --> 06:41:58,510
There's a VR mod.

7728
06:42:03,720 --> 06:42:05,840
I would become one of those people.

7729
06:42:06,120 --> 06:42:07,180
There's a Yudacamp game.

7730
06:42:08,020 --> 06:42:08,740
In VR.

7731
06:42:09,020 --> 06:42:09,900
If you guys didn't know.

7732
06:42:10,340 --> 06:42:12,740
And like all you do is just sit there.

7733
06:42:12,880 --> 06:42:13,720
And do nothing.

7734
06:42:14,100 --> 06:42:15,280
And that's what I would do.

7735
06:42:17,340 --> 06:42:18,180
I would exist in their headset.

7736
06:42:18,440 --> 06:42:19,580
I would just sit in here.

7737
06:42:19,700 --> 06:42:20,840
And I would listen to the music.

7738
06:42:20,960 --> 06:42:22,060
And the crackling.

7739
06:42:22,260 --> 06:42:23,580
I would just stare up at the sky.

7740
06:42:23,960 --> 06:42:24,540
I would be like...

7741
06:42:25,120 --> 06:42:27,760
I'm going to become one with my chair.

7742
06:42:31,140 --> 06:42:33,160
I'm never moving from this location.

7743
06:42:45,770 --> 06:42:48,490
I want to do some more VR.

7744
06:42:48,810 --> 06:42:49,890
Or maybe not VR.

7745
06:42:51,790 --> 06:42:52,610
Some like...

7746
06:42:55,950 --> 06:42:57,130
I want to do the...

7747
06:42:57,130 --> 06:42:59,790
The new WarioWare game.

7748
06:43:00,350 --> 06:43:01,550
Once I have like...

7749
06:43:03,330 --> 06:43:04,950
I don't know if you guys have seen it.

7750
06:43:05,130 --> 06:43:06,890
But the artist has been posting it on Twitter.

7751
06:43:07,230 --> 06:43:09,950
There's like a chibi mint 3D model.

7752
06:43:10,230 --> 06:43:11,030
That's getting made.

7753
06:43:13,050 --> 06:43:14,490
I want to try it with that.

7754
06:43:16,750 --> 06:43:17,330
Oh no.

7755
06:43:17,490 --> 06:43:18,090
Oh no.

7756
06:43:18,870 --> 06:43:20,890
That's the noise that Matara makes.

7757
06:43:24,650 --> 06:43:27,850
Are you going to watch the anime where the wife dies but reincarnates?

7758
06:43:27,930 --> 06:43:28,290
Oh the...

7759
06:43:28,290 --> 06:43:29,650
My wife is a...

7760
06:43:32,390 --> 06:43:33,990
Reincarnated as an elementary school student.

7761
06:43:34,090 --> 06:43:34,310
Or whatever.

7762
06:43:34,610 --> 06:43:35,230
No I...

7763
06:43:35,230 --> 06:43:38,510
I remember seeing all the people being mad about it.

7764
06:43:38,570 --> 06:43:40,450
But I heard the story was actually really good.

7765
06:43:44,010 --> 06:43:45,670
Don't judge a book by it's cover everybody.

7766
06:43:47,050 --> 06:43:47,490
Or...

7767
06:43:48,010 --> 06:43:49,530
A light novel by it's title.

7768
06:43:50,890 --> 06:43:52,390
My light novel titles are so long.

7769
06:43:53,010 --> 06:43:54,050
They're supposed to...

7770
06:43:54,050 --> 06:43:54,530
Because...

7771
06:43:57,810 --> 06:43:58,690
They just...

7772
06:43:58,690 --> 06:44:00,610
From what I remember...

7773
06:44:00,610 --> 06:44:02,350
And someone can correct me if I was wrong.

7774
06:44:02,450 --> 06:44:04,050
But the site that they were hosted on...

7775
06:44:04,630 --> 06:44:05,790
Didn't allow descriptions.

7776
06:44:06,630 --> 06:44:08,930
And so they had to put the description of the...

7777
06:44:08,930 --> 06:44:09,870
Of the...

7778
06:44:09,870 --> 06:44:11,730
Of the work into the title.

7779
06:44:11,810 --> 06:44:12,590
They had to work it in.

7780
06:44:18,650 --> 06:44:20,030
Yeah and so that's why...

7781
06:44:20,030 --> 06:44:21,890
You have all these titles that are like...

7782
06:44:22,410 --> 06:44:23,750
Ridiculously long and silly.

7783
06:44:30,290 --> 06:44:31,870
I've heard that explanation too.

7784
06:44:32,010 --> 06:44:32,830
Yeah yeah.

7785
06:44:34,170 --> 06:44:35,010
Unfortunate name.

7786
06:44:35,090 --> 06:44:35,950
Heartwarming story.

7787
06:44:36,490 --> 06:44:39,470
I mean I guess it got people's eyes on it.

7788
06:44:39,690 --> 06:44:41,110
And once it comes out...

7789
06:44:41,110 --> 06:44:42,230
I mean but the manga...

7790
06:44:42,230 --> 06:44:44,170
There was also like a live action I think.

7791
06:44:44,530 --> 06:44:45,730
The manga's been out.

7792
06:44:46,950 --> 06:44:47,970
I mean there...

7793
06:44:47,970 --> 06:44:50,150
You'll have people that will watch because of like...

7794
06:44:50,150 --> 06:44:52,490
You know the morbid curiosity type.

7795
06:44:53,210 --> 06:44:54,890
And then they'll see...

7796
06:44:54,890 --> 06:44:56,850
That it's not as bad as they...

7797
06:44:58,810 --> 06:44:58,870
.

7798
06:45:04,060 --> 06:45:06,680
And it's so crazy to see how dark it gets.

7799
06:45:17,400 --> 06:45:17,880
.

7800
06:45:17,880 --> 06:45:19,140
Oh my controller's going crazy.

7801
06:45:19,320 --> 06:45:20,940
For someone who's read it it's genuinely like...

7802
06:45:21,600 --> 06:45:22,140
Reincarnation sucks.

7803
06:45:22,480 --> 06:45:23,720
Learn to adapt laws.

7804
06:45:28,740 --> 06:45:30,260
Yeah reincarnation does suck.

7805
06:45:30,620 --> 06:45:32,160
Being a ghost is the best.

7806
06:45:32,420 --> 06:45:32,900
.

7807
06:45:35,740 --> 06:45:36,220
.

7808
06:45:36,220 --> 06:45:38,120
Don't reincarnate just become a ghost.

7809
06:45:46,340 --> 06:45:46,820
.

7810
06:45:50,690 --> 06:45:54,950
Okay, let me put my plate... I just finished too, so let me put my plate down.

7811
06:45:55,910 --> 06:45:56,950
Okay, awesome.

7812
06:45:58,350 --> 06:45:58,910
Yippee!

7813
06:45:58,910 --> 06:45:59,470
Alrighty!

7814
06:46:01,810 --> 06:46:04,610
We have our next thing that we gotta do.

7815
06:46:07,010 --> 06:46:08,990
I don't remember what we gotta do.

7816
06:46:09,150 --> 06:46:10,430
22 minute break over.

7817
06:46:14,170 --> 06:46:15,290
Alright, so...

7818
06:46:16,150 --> 06:46:17,490
For this one...

7819
06:46:19,530 --> 06:46:19,970
Uh...

7820
06:46:20,670 --> 06:46:21,330
This one.

7821
06:46:22,390 --> 06:46:22,830
Okay.

7822
06:46:23,430 --> 06:46:24,970
They go to the bridge.

7823
06:46:25,570 --> 06:46:27,170
I don't remember where this is at all.

7824
06:46:27,730 --> 06:46:29,190
They hand over the goods.

7825
06:46:29,910 --> 06:46:30,710
The codes.

7826
06:46:30,850 --> 06:46:32,590
They walk away into the woods.

7827
06:46:33,210 --> 06:46:34,910
Then they go through the fire, right?

7828
06:46:36,310 --> 06:46:36,750
Ah!

7829
06:46:36,910 --> 06:46:37,490
The fishing!

7830
06:46:37,670 --> 06:46:38,030
Sorry.

7831
06:46:39,290 --> 06:46:40,990
I always forget about it.

7832
06:46:41,170 --> 06:46:41,610
Okay.

7833
06:46:43,850 --> 06:46:44,430
Oh wait.

7834
06:46:44,550 --> 06:46:45,350
One second again.

7835
06:46:45,590 --> 06:46:45,990
My bad.

7836
06:46:46,270 --> 06:46:46,950
My bad.

7837
06:46:47,010 --> 06:46:47,290
My bad.

7838
06:46:47,370 --> 06:46:47,670
There we go.

7839
06:46:47,770 --> 06:46:47,990
Okay.

7840
06:46:49,010 --> 06:46:49,490
Okay!

7841
06:46:50,130 --> 06:46:51,830
And then they go through the fire.

7842
06:46:54,210 --> 06:46:56,490
So some people said this is the easiest one.

7843
06:46:56,550 --> 06:46:59,030
I sure hope you guys aren't pulling my leg.

7844
06:47:01,630 --> 06:47:03,030
Or my ghost tail.

7845
06:47:03,830 --> 06:47:05,530
Hope you guys aren't pulling my ghost tail.

7846
06:47:14,320 --> 06:47:16,260
I hate when you guys do the smileys.

7847
06:47:16,300 --> 06:47:17,680
I'm retracting that rule.

7848
06:47:18,320 --> 06:47:20,540
It feels like you're mocking me at this point.

7849
06:47:20,540 --> 06:47:22,420
It feels like you're mocking me.

7850
06:47:29,440 --> 06:47:31,060
I don't like it anymore.

7851
06:47:33,280 --> 06:47:34,760
I don't like it anymore.

7852
06:47:37,100 --> 06:47:37,720
Okay.

7853
06:47:38,500 --> 06:47:40,800
At least with this...

7854
06:47:44,600 --> 06:47:46,680
Coming in easy.

7855
06:47:47,200 --> 06:47:47,520
Oh!

7856
06:47:47,540 --> 06:47:48,000
Just kidding.

7857
06:47:55,810 --> 06:48:03,010
If I'm so fast and I leave the hatch before my helmet has finished putting on its head...

7858
06:48:04,310 --> 06:48:05,230
Do I die?

7859
06:48:17,410 --> 06:48:20,810
You know how like the helmet will like go over your head while you're...

7860
06:48:20,810 --> 06:48:23,130
When you get back up from the...

7861
06:48:24,770 --> 06:48:25,890
From the...

7862
06:48:27,070 --> 06:48:27,970
The seat?

7863
06:48:30,730 --> 06:48:32,670
Can we have a no-elp emote?

7864
06:48:32,670 --> 06:48:33,010
No!

7865
06:48:36,130 --> 06:48:36,590
No!

7866
06:48:38,150 --> 06:48:40,150
You guys don't deserve a no-elp.

7867
06:48:40,650 --> 06:48:41,730
I don't even know...

7868
06:48:41,730 --> 06:48:43,330
I don't even know why you say it like that.

7869
06:48:43,390 --> 06:48:44,370
Someone said it's from Twitch?

7870
06:48:44,990 --> 06:48:46,430
You think we're on Twitch here?

7871
06:48:47,130 --> 06:48:48,070
Give me a break.

7872
06:48:49,570 --> 06:48:51,190
This is no Twitch stream.

7873
06:49:10,960 --> 06:49:11,420
Alright.

7874
06:49:11,520 --> 06:49:13,100
We don't have as much time here.

7875
06:49:13,280 --> 06:49:15,700
Because we basically have until the dam breaks.

7876
06:49:16,900 --> 06:49:17,360
Um...

7877
06:49:17,920 --> 06:49:18,660
This way.

7878
06:49:22,590 --> 06:49:23,950
So we're gonna have to...

7879
06:49:25,910 --> 06:49:26,310
Scadaddle.

7880
06:49:30,070 --> 06:49:32,850
I think maybe that's why I did the other one before.

7881
06:49:32,990 --> 06:49:34,890
I was just like, oh I have more time because...

7882
06:49:34,890 --> 06:49:37,670
Even when the dam breaks I can keep going.

7883
06:49:38,410 --> 06:49:39,210
But not here.

7884
06:49:40,210 --> 06:49:41,250
First what we're gonna do...

7885
06:49:43,310 --> 06:49:44,790
You made it to the party once before.

7886
06:49:44,890 --> 06:49:45,830
What's the plan this time?

7887
06:49:47,250 --> 06:49:47,650
Um...

7888
06:49:48,070 --> 06:49:48,810
We're gonna...

7889
06:49:49,350 --> 06:49:51,370
We're gonna look at the area...

7890
06:49:51,370 --> 06:49:52,990
In data mode.

7891
06:49:58,820 --> 06:50:01,320
We're gonna look at the area in data mode.

7892
06:50:03,220 --> 06:50:05,600
I don't quite remember where the bridge is.

7893
06:50:05,740 --> 06:50:06,380
Oh not this one.

7894
06:50:16,980 --> 06:50:17,980
There we go.

7895
06:50:18,120 --> 06:50:18,540
This way.

7896
06:50:18,740 --> 06:50:19,900
Oh maybe this is the bridge.

7897
06:50:21,900 --> 06:50:23,280
I think this is it actually.

7898
06:50:25,920 --> 06:50:27,020
But we have to...

7899
06:50:27,900 --> 06:50:28,500
Yeah.

7900
06:50:28,660 --> 06:50:29,620
I think so.

7901
06:50:29,840 --> 06:50:31,600
But we have to bring it into existence.

7902
06:50:38,790 --> 06:50:40,310
It was like around here?

7903
06:50:40,670 --> 06:50:41,010
Nope.

7904
06:50:41,050 --> 06:50:41,450
Just kidding.

7905
06:50:41,750 --> 06:50:42,230
Uh...

7906
06:50:44,970 --> 06:50:45,570
Uh...

7907
06:50:45,570 --> 06:50:46,230
I'm lost.

7908
06:50:47,110 --> 06:50:47,710
Here?

7909
06:50:48,570 --> 06:50:49,330
Over here?

7910
06:50:52,030 --> 06:50:52,630
Yeah.

7911
06:50:52,630 --> 06:50:52,930
Right here.

7912
06:50:54,350 --> 06:50:54,950
Perfect.

7913
06:50:59,330 --> 06:51:00,870
And there we go.

7914
06:51:01,510 --> 06:51:02,110
Okay.

7915
06:51:07,510 --> 06:51:10,510
I'm trying to decide where I want to leave.

7916
06:51:12,910 --> 06:51:13,450
You know what?

7917
06:51:13,470 --> 06:51:14,110
I'm gonna leave it here.

7918
06:51:14,230 --> 06:51:15,410
Because we can see all through here.

7919
06:51:19,030 --> 06:51:19,390
Wow.

7920
06:51:21,470 --> 06:51:21,830
Wowee.

7921
06:51:26,090 --> 06:51:26,730
Oh wait.

7922
06:51:27,270 --> 06:51:28,450
I think there's the hand.

7923
06:51:28,990 --> 06:51:29,190
Wait.

7924
06:51:29,250 --> 06:51:29,570
No I don't.

7925
06:51:29,590 --> 06:51:29,770
No.

7926
06:51:29,910 --> 06:51:30,490
There's no...

7927
06:51:30,490 --> 06:51:30,810
Not...

7928
06:51:30,810 --> 06:51:31,250
Not yet.

7929
06:51:31,310 --> 06:51:31,550
Not yet.

7930
06:51:35,520 --> 06:51:36,440
Oh you can see him.

7931
06:51:42,010 --> 06:51:42,490
Well...

7932
06:51:42,490 --> 06:51:43,930
They can't see me in this mode.

7933
06:51:44,050 --> 06:51:45,150
So what if I just go in there?

7934
06:51:49,010 --> 06:51:49,490
Right?

7935
06:52:01,060 --> 06:52:01,880
The elevator.

7936
06:52:02,260 --> 06:52:02,680
Yeah.

7937
06:52:03,020 --> 06:52:03,720
That's true.

7938
06:52:04,800 --> 06:52:06,880
I can't remember where the entrance...

7939
06:52:06,880 --> 06:52:07,100
Oh.

7940
06:52:07,140 --> 06:52:07,420
Okay.

7941
06:52:07,440 --> 06:52:08,080
It's down over here.

7942
06:52:08,660 --> 06:52:09,140
Hello.

7943
06:52:09,620 --> 06:52:10,100
Sorry.

7944
06:52:11,000 --> 06:52:11,480
Continue.

7945
06:52:13,520 --> 06:52:14,300
Keep going.

7946
06:52:16,540 --> 06:52:18,540
I'm trying to see like how every...

7947
06:52:18,540 --> 06:52:19,360
Often...

7948
06:52:19,360 --> 06:52:19,520
I don't know.

7949
06:52:22,560 --> 06:52:24,340
A guy shows up.

7950
06:52:24,680 --> 06:52:25,200
Oh there's...

7951
06:52:25,200 --> 06:52:25,500
Okay.

7952
06:52:25,620 --> 06:52:26,860
I was gonna say there's something here.

7953
06:52:27,060 --> 06:52:28,100
It's just...

7954
06:52:29,640 --> 06:52:31,440
They can't even program...

7955
06:52:32,640 --> 06:52:33,500
Comfier chairs.

7956
06:52:36,540 --> 06:52:38,500
What is in this house anyway?

7957
06:52:42,080 --> 06:52:43,680
This is where they're all coming from.

7958
06:52:44,920 --> 06:52:46,100
What's over here anyway?

7959
06:52:50,820 --> 06:52:52,660
Look how close these two are together.

7960
06:52:52,780 --> 06:52:53,240
That's not fair.

7961
06:52:53,420 --> 06:52:53,800
Oh.

7962
06:52:56,080 --> 06:52:56,600
I was gonna say.

7963
06:52:56,600 --> 06:52:56,620
I was gonna say.

7964
06:52:56,620 --> 06:52:57,100
I was gonna say.

7965
06:52:58,200 --> 06:52:59,320
Back up buddy.

7966
06:52:59,400 --> 06:52:59,900
Back up.

7967
06:53:01,980 --> 06:53:02,500
Oh.

7968
06:53:02,880 --> 06:53:04,020
You can't go inside.

7969
06:53:05,740 --> 06:53:06,260
Oh.

7970
06:53:07,240 --> 06:53:07,760
Ouch.

7971
06:53:09,100 --> 06:53:09,620
Okay.

7972
06:53:11,180 --> 06:53:11,700
Nevermind.

7973
06:53:14,020 --> 06:53:14,860
No worries.

7974
06:53:15,440 --> 06:53:15,960
Oh.

7975
06:53:17,200 --> 06:53:19,640
If I have to redo the loop this time it's okay.

7976
06:53:20,100 --> 06:53:21,620
Outer Wilds VR Mission.

7977
06:53:21,800 --> 06:53:22,560
That's literally...

7978
06:53:22,560 --> 06:53:22,780
Yeah.

7979
06:53:27,460 --> 06:53:27,900
There's no way you can't follow me.

7980
06:53:27,900 --> 06:53:28,200
So the...

7981
06:53:28,200 --> 06:53:31,260
At some point there will be two guys that are really close to each other.

7982
06:53:32,200 --> 06:53:34,380
But when it's those two guys, I can go.

7983
06:53:36,460 --> 06:53:37,120
I believe.

7984
06:53:38,800 --> 06:53:40,580
They look so similar to me.

7985
06:53:42,660 --> 06:53:43,100
Okay.

7986
06:53:43,160 --> 06:53:44,120
Can I just walk?

7987
06:53:46,400 --> 06:53:49,420
Do I have to go through the whole basement thing?

7988
06:53:49,700 --> 06:53:51,060
Can I just walk over there?

7989
06:53:51,780 --> 06:53:52,380
Let's see.

7990
06:53:53,360 --> 06:53:53,800
What is this?

7991
06:53:55,180 --> 06:53:55,720
This way.

7992
06:53:56,800 --> 06:53:58,120
Oh no, it goes underwater.

7993
06:53:59,020 --> 06:53:59,840
Good to know.

7994
06:54:01,120 --> 06:54:01,860
Good to know.

7995
06:54:01,940 --> 06:54:02,380
Good to know.

7996
06:54:02,420 --> 06:54:02,920
Good to know.

7997
06:54:03,400 --> 06:54:04,900
And then you come out on the other side.

7998
06:54:05,020 --> 06:54:05,420
Good to know.

7999
06:54:05,460 --> 06:54:05,800
Good to know.

8000
06:54:05,820 --> 06:54:06,160
Good to know.

8001
06:54:06,160 --> 06:54:06,520
Good to know.

8002
06:54:06,540 --> 06:54:06,920
Good to know.

8003
06:54:09,340 --> 06:54:11,380
Oh, then there's another guy.

8004
06:54:11,520 --> 06:54:11,720
Okay.

8005
06:54:14,260 --> 06:54:15,460
Hold on, my turn first.

8006
06:54:17,300 --> 06:54:18,280
My turn first.

8007
06:54:19,040 --> 06:54:19,640
I'm going.

8008
06:54:21,340 --> 06:54:21,980
I'm going.

8009
06:54:23,100 --> 06:54:24,760
Wow, it's so pretty in here!

8010
06:54:31,900 --> 06:54:34,280
This guy's slow as molasses.

8011
06:54:34,880 --> 06:54:35,880
You're going ghost?

8012
06:54:36,540 --> 06:54:38,720
I mean, this is just Minto World, is it not?

8013
06:54:46,190 --> 06:54:47,350
This is Minto Vision.

8014
06:54:48,430 --> 06:54:48,910
Essentially.

8015
06:54:57,200 --> 06:54:59,020
I can hear them.

8016
06:55:00,840 --> 06:55:02,300
They're little...

8017
06:55:02,300 --> 06:55:04,760
Okay, I wanted to... Oh, okay, there's nothing over here.

8018
06:55:05,000 --> 06:55:06,140
Well, good thing I didn't...

8019
06:55:12,820 --> 06:55:13,220
Oh!

8020
06:55:21,170 --> 06:55:22,430
Oh, they still see me.

8021
06:55:22,710 --> 06:55:23,370
Oh my god.

8022
06:55:24,690 --> 06:55:25,090
Yeah!

8023
06:55:26,690 --> 06:55:27,330
Oh, that's right.

8024
06:55:27,430 --> 06:55:28,430
They can still see me.

8025
06:55:28,530 --> 06:55:29,350
They can still see me.

8026
06:55:29,370 --> 06:55:30,450
I just have to... yeah.

8027
06:55:30,810 --> 06:55:33,830
I just... I can hide better is what the... yeah.

8028
06:55:34,270 --> 06:55:34,670
Okay.

8029
06:55:37,110 --> 06:55:37,510
Okay.

8030
06:55:39,490 --> 06:55:41,250
I don't know what to do.

8031
06:55:41,870 --> 06:55:43,210
Okay, well clearly...

8032
06:55:43,770 --> 06:55:46,230
Okay, first thing we gotta do is we gotta blow out...

8033
06:55:46,230 --> 06:55:49,030
the light, which was...

8034
06:55:51,490 --> 06:55:52,250
um...

8035
06:55:57,570 --> 06:55:59,090
which was...

8036
06:55:59,090 --> 06:56:00,270
uh...

8037
06:56:05,080 --> 06:56:06,560
which was...

8038
06:56:08,440 --> 06:56:09,200
somewhere.

8039
06:56:16,630 --> 06:56:17,830
Over here, maybe?

8040
06:56:19,630 --> 06:56:22,470
I think you may have actually figured out this puzzle previously.

8041
06:56:25,090 --> 06:56:25,470
Um...

8042
06:56:25,470 --> 06:56:25,850
Um...

8043
06:56:27,850 --> 06:56:30,550
Well, I did know how to get past them.

8044
06:56:31,010 --> 06:56:33,510
So I did... yes, figure that out.

8045
06:56:33,790 --> 06:56:35,810
Oh, no, this is to open that up.

8046
06:56:37,010 --> 06:56:37,450
Um...

8047
06:56:38,450 --> 06:56:39,850
How do I turn off the light?

8048
06:56:55,610 --> 06:56:56,350
Hold on.

8049
06:56:56,410 --> 06:56:56,950
I don't remember.

8050
06:56:57,250 --> 06:56:57,730
Oh, shoot.

8051
06:56:59,710 --> 06:57:00,150
What?

8052
06:57:04,870 --> 06:57:05,910
What's your goal now?

8053
06:57:06,050 --> 06:57:06,950
To sneak in!

8054
06:57:08,830 --> 06:57:10,110
I think.

8055
06:57:24,760 --> 06:57:25,720
Act natural.

8056
06:57:26,780 --> 06:57:27,740
Act natural.

8057
06:57:28,440 --> 06:57:29,920
Act natural.

8058
06:57:50,700 --> 06:57:51,780
Oh, shoot.

8059
06:57:53,460 --> 06:57:54,760
We're gonna follow...

8060
06:57:54,760 --> 06:57:55,820
Nothing?

8061
06:57:56,060 --> 06:57:57,460
I don't see anyone.

8062
06:58:06,550 --> 06:58:07,690
Where'd he go?

8063
06:58:20,070 --> 06:58:20,590
Ah!

8064
06:58:21,610 --> 06:58:22,630
Where'd you come from?

8065
06:58:23,030 --> 06:58:24,070
You jerk.

8066
06:58:26,010 --> 06:58:26,530
Okay.

8067
06:58:28,690 --> 06:58:30,310
What was it that I did?

8068
06:58:31,510 --> 06:58:33,270
I wish I could go back to the ship...

8069
06:58:33,270 --> 06:58:34,670
and watch the thing again.

8070
06:58:37,090 --> 06:58:38,130
No, they...

8071
06:58:41,740 --> 06:58:42,660
Oh, that was close.

8072
06:58:43,200 --> 06:58:44,640
What was it that they did?

8073
06:58:45,500 --> 06:58:46,540
They went...

8074
06:58:47,160 --> 06:58:47,960
Okay, hold on.

8075
06:58:48,080 --> 06:58:48,780
I'm trying to remember.

8076
06:58:51,060 --> 06:58:51,880
They like...

8077
06:58:53,080 --> 06:58:55,680
Went from the bridge, but it looked like some back way.

8078
06:58:58,400 --> 06:58:59,900
Or was it from the bridge?

8079
06:59:00,140 --> 06:59:00,980
I don't even know.

8080
06:59:01,220 --> 06:59:02,140
Maybe they did...

8081
06:59:03,660 --> 06:59:04,180
Eh?

8082
06:59:09,430 --> 06:59:10,930
I think it was from...

8083
06:59:10,930 --> 06:59:12,590
Maybe the bridge over there.

8084
06:59:17,840 --> 06:59:19,540
I see them walking.

8085
06:59:23,020 --> 06:59:23,540
Oh...

8086
06:59:28,980 --> 06:59:29,940
Oh my god.

8087
06:59:30,760 --> 06:59:31,620
Oh wait.

8088
06:59:31,820 --> 06:59:32,480
Grabby grab.

8089
06:59:35,480 --> 06:59:36,980
Grabby grab did something.

8090
06:59:37,380 --> 06:59:38,360
What did it do before?

8091
06:59:42,180 --> 06:59:42,920
What the?

8092
06:59:43,100 --> 06:59:44,220
Oh, shoot.

8093
06:59:44,420 --> 06:59:44,640
No!

8094
06:59:45,520 --> 06:59:46,520
Oh, I forgot.

8095
06:59:46,820 --> 06:59:48,060
Okay, we'll just meditate.

8096
06:59:48,380 --> 06:59:48,900
Shoot.

8097
06:59:50,520 --> 06:59:51,160
Oh...

8098
06:59:51,160 --> 06:59:51,260
Oh...

8099
06:59:51,260 --> 06:59:51,660
Oh...

8100
06:59:51,660 --> 06:59:52,040
Oh...

8101
06:59:52,040 --> 06:59:52,380
Oh...

8102
06:59:52,380 --> 06:59:52,460
Oh, god...

8103
07:00:02,980 --> 07:00:03,500
Uh

8104
07:00:12,360 --> 07:00:12,880
-oh.

8105
07:00:12,880 --> 07:00:12,900
What happened to the water?

8106
07:00:12,900 --> 07:00:14,080
Yeah, we can watch the log now.

8107
07:00:14,220 --> 07:00:15,340
We can watch the log.

8108
07:00:23,980 --> 07:00:25,520
We have all the tools you need.

8109
07:00:26,120 --> 07:00:27,160
Yeah, I know.

8110
07:00:28,640 --> 07:00:29,680
I'm just...

8111
07:00:30,940 --> 07:00:31,980
They walk...

8112
07:00:31,980 --> 07:00:33,140
I can't remember.

8113
07:00:33,400 --> 07:00:34,780
They walk somewhere.

8114
07:00:36,020 --> 07:00:36,940
Okay, hold on.

8115
07:00:44,020 --> 07:00:45,200
Okay, so yeah.

8116
07:00:45,300 --> 07:00:46,940
Wait, that is the bridge, right?

8117
07:00:48,500 --> 07:00:49,120
Is it?

8118
07:00:50,540 --> 07:00:51,640
They walk somewhere.

8119
07:00:51,860 --> 07:00:52,500
That has to be.

8120
07:00:54,740 --> 07:00:56,000
They walk through there.

8121
07:00:58,800 --> 07:00:59,520
To there.

8122
07:00:59,580 --> 07:01:00,660
Yeah, that has to be.

8123
07:01:01,540 --> 07:01:02,500
And then...

8124
07:01:05,140 --> 07:01:06,040
They walk through.

8125
07:01:11,400 --> 07:01:12,200
So does...

8126
07:01:14,500 --> 07:01:16,080
The light never have to go off at all?

8127
07:01:21,210 --> 07:01:24,810
The funny thing is she came to the conclusion and thought it out loud and she forgore.

8128
07:01:24,890 --> 07:01:25,550
It's so funny.

8129
07:01:25,730 --> 07:01:26,030
Why?

8130
07:01:26,510 --> 07:01:27,190
No way!

8131
07:01:27,630 --> 07:01:28,650
Am I that dumb?

8132
07:01:29,350 --> 07:01:30,050
Don't tell me.

8133
07:01:30,230 --> 07:01:30,970
Don't say yes.

8134
07:01:32,370 --> 07:01:32,770
What?

8135
07:01:32,770 --> 07:01:34,690
Wait, then if I already came up with the...

8136
07:01:35,450 --> 07:01:37,270
With the conclusion, you guys can tell me.

8137
07:01:38,770 --> 07:01:42,610
If I already came up with the solution myself, then you guys can let me know.

8138
07:01:46,890 --> 07:01:49,830
If I already came up with it...

8139
07:01:58,980 --> 07:01:59,380
Right?

8140
07:02:06,200 --> 07:02:08,500
You have to put two and three together yourself.

8141
07:02:08,760 --> 07:02:13,620
Oh, so it wasn't like... Okay, now that... Okay, that actually helps me more than you guys realize though.

8142
07:02:13,660 --> 07:02:18,300
Because if I had been like, wait, the solution... If I said the solution earlier...

8143
07:02:21,400 --> 07:02:22,860
While I was...

8144
07:02:22,860 --> 07:02:31,940
While I was doing the thing, then I would have... Like this whole part, then I would have been like, oh, okay.

8145
07:02:33,160 --> 07:02:34,220
What did I forget?

8146
07:02:34,560 --> 07:02:38,420
If I figure out the solution somewhere...

8147
07:02:45,030 --> 07:02:46,150
I'm so...

8148
07:02:47,130 --> 07:02:48,730
I'm so confused.

8149
07:02:53,050 --> 07:02:53,490
Mintomatics.

8150
07:02:54,730 --> 07:02:55,170
Thanks.

8151
07:02:57,990 --> 07:02:59,050
Thanks a whole lot.

8152
07:03:00,230 --> 07:03:01,390
Minto brain small.

8153
07:03:01,950 --> 07:03:03,210
What did I figure out?

8154
07:03:03,470 --> 07:03:04,730
Well, I... You know what, guys?

8155
07:03:04,790 --> 07:03:05,970
That doesn't actually help me at all.

8156
07:03:05,990 --> 07:03:07,530
Because I figured out so much today.

8157
07:03:10,190 --> 07:03:11,770
I've figured out a ton.

8158
07:03:15,670 --> 07:03:16,110
And...

8159
07:03:16,770 --> 07:03:19,210
So, it could be literally anything.

8160
07:03:20,770 --> 07:03:21,210
I'm...

8161
07:03:21,210 --> 07:03:23,290
I'm banning no ELP from my chat.

8162
07:03:23,390 --> 07:03:24,410
I hate it.

8163
07:03:24,490 --> 07:03:25,910
I actually hate it now.

8164
07:03:26,050 --> 07:03:27,770
Now, it actually pisses me off.

8165
07:03:27,910 --> 07:03:29,450
I'm banning it from my chat.

8166
07:03:33,410 --> 07:03:34,010
Wait, what?

8167
07:03:34,130 --> 07:03:34,630
What was that?

8168
07:03:35,070 --> 07:03:35,710
Up there.

8169
07:03:35,830 --> 07:03:36,430
What was that?

8170
07:03:45,520 --> 07:03:48,540
Wait, can I get a hint where I figured it out?

8171
07:03:49,180 --> 07:03:50,600
When I figured it out?

8172
07:03:54,780 --> 07:03:56,700
What context I figured it out?

8173
07:04:05,160 --> 07:04:06,700
Two to three hours ago?

8174
07:04:16,260 --> 07:04:18,080
Oh, I always forget to wake back up.

8175
07:04:42,050 --> 07:04:44,310
If you didn't figure it out, it was unrelated.

8176
07:04:44,630 --> 07:04:46,650
I was just desperate to spoil the solution.

8177
07:04:48,070 --> 07:04:50,550
Well, now I feel even dumber.

8178
07:04:50,710 --> 07:04:51,110
Thanks.

8179
07:04:51,730 --> 07:04:53,130
So, I didn't even figure it out.

8180
07:04:53,250 --> 07:04:54,110
You guys are just...

8181
07:05:27,810 --> 07:05:28,530
Okey-dokey.

8182
07:05:38,350 --> 07:05:40,990
I did, just not that it was a solution to a puzzle.

8183
07:05:41,370 --> 07:05:42,450
Ah, I see, I see.

8184
07:05:45,190 --> 07:05:47,390
You're so tense that you didn't realize you figured it out.

8185
07:06:03,710 --> 07:06:04,430
There's our guy.

8186
07:06:05,550 --> 07:06:06,550
Is it one or two?

8187
07:06:10,410 --> 07:06:10,850
Huh...

8188
07:06:15,680 --> 07:06:16,340
It's two?

8189
07:06:16,680 --> 07:06:17,500
It's two of them.

8190
07:06:19,500 --> 07:06:22,040
So clearly, the solution is to blow their things out.

8191
07:06:26,520 --> 07:06:26,960
Ok.

8192
07:06:27,140 --> 07:06:28,140
So, we'll wait for these two.

8193
07:06:29,180 --> 07:06:31,380
Um, when the second guy goes...

8194
07:06:35,250 --> 07:06:35,690
Um...

8195
07:06:36,790 --> 07:06:38,310
That's when we can go.

8196
07:06:39,510 --> 07:06:39,950
I

8197
07:06:46,400 --> 07:06:49,360
don't remember where the entrance is, which is why I'm trying to get closer.

8198
07:06:55,250 --> 07:07:00,260
No one else has come yet.

8199
07:07:03,140 --> 07:07:04,340
Don't fall in the water.

8200
07:07:21,170 --> 07:07:22,230
Wait, where'd it go?

8201
07:07:24,610 --> 07:07:25,150
Oh there.

8202
07:07:26,010 --> 07:07:26,450
Right?

8203
07:07:27,430 --> 07:07:27,870
Here?

8204
07:07:27,990 --> 07:07:28,210
Yeah.

8205
07:07:37,320 --> 07:07:39,200
In fact, I'll just conceal just in case.

8206
07:07:41,620 --> 07:07:43,640
That thing just vibrated.

8207
07:07:50,530 --> 07:07:51,990
They can't see me.

8208
07:07:56,080 --> 07:07:58,300
Um, act natural everybody.

8209
07:07:59,300 --> 07:08:00,560
Act natural.

8210
07:08:04,040 --> 07:08:04,800
Okay.

8211
07:08:05,100 --> 07:08:06,780
Act natural everybody.

8212
07:08:11,100 --> 07:08:12,900
Oh my god, it's so loud.

8213
07:08:16,980 --> 07:08:18,140
Wait, I can't see.

8214
07:08:19,440 --> 07:08:22,340
Okay, we're fine.

8215
07:08:23,060 --> 07:08:23,740
Everything's good.

8216
07:08:37,100 --> 07:08:38,140
You jerk!

8217
07:08:52,860 --> 07:08:53,900
Close one.

8218
07:08:58,640 --> 07:09:00,060
Got a good look at him though.

8219
07:09:00,240 --> 07:09:02,080
He looked really cool like in the...

8220
07:09:03,300 --> 07:09:04,620
In the shadow, you know?

8221
07:09:10,320 --> 07:09:12,260
I don't think he's going to move.

8222
07:09:14,500 --> 07:09:16,520
I have a feeling he's not going to move.

8223
07:09:16,580 --> 07:09:22,040
Especially because when I came before, another guy was the one who came out and grabbed me.

8224
07:09:34,870 --> 07:09:36,570
A little shortcut with the grabby grabs.

8225
07:09:36,750 --> 07:09:37,490
I always forget.

8226
07:09:39,410 --> 07:09:42,430
I actually don't know... I don't remember where this one leads.

8227
07:09:45,650 --> 07:09:46,670
I don't remember.

8228
07:09:50,240 --> 07:09:52,120
Oh, I saw one I think.

8229
07:09:57,700 --> 07:09:58,940
Just going to go forward.

8230
07:10:02,960 --> 07:10:03,600
Oh shoot.

8231
07:10:03,720 --> 07:10:04,000
Oh shoot.

8232
07:10:05,780 --> 07:10:07,360
Why don't they stop coming?

8233
07:10:07,440 --> 07:10:08,460
How many of them are you?

8234
07:10:09,540 --> 07:10:12,520
This can be the easiest or the hardest depending on your big brain.

8235
07:10:12,660 --> 07:10:13,400
Oh gosh.

8236
07:10:13,660 --> 07:10:14,460
Oh gosh.

8237
07:10:14,460 --> 07:10:15,000
Guys...

8238
07:10:21,130 --> 07:10:22,790
Why is the game so dark?

8239
07:10:22,890 --> 07:10:23,670
Because it's dark!

8240
07:10:30,740 --> 07:10:32,740
I don't know where his path is.

8241
07:10:37,260 --> 07:10:39,980
Oh my gosh, wait, no... is that a... no.

8242
07:10:40,840 --> 07:10:42,060
I don't think that's another one.

8243
07:10:45,380 --> 07:10:47,040
I'm just gonna get up behind him.

8244
07:10:53,610 --> 07:10:54,710
Okay, easy mode.

8245
07:10:55,090 --> 07:10:55,750
Here we go.

8246
07:10:56,550 --> 07:10:57,290
We're following.

8247
07:11:00,070 --> 07:11:01,550
This one was the hardest for me?

8248
07:11:01,670 --> 07:11:02,350
Oh gosh.

8249
07:11:03,970 --> 07:11:06,030
No, why can't you guys give me a hint?

8250
07:11:10,970 --> 07:11:12,530
I've gone through so much, you guys.

8251
07:11:12,650 --> 07:11:13,050
Please.

8252
07:11:23,880 --> 07:11:25,740
Any help spoils the solution.

8253
07:11:41,660 --> 07:11:44,860
I'm trying not to get too close to this guy, but I don't know if there's someone...

8254
07:11:44,860 --> 07:11:46,260
I don't think there's anyone following him.

8255
07:11:46,340 --> 07:11:47,340
I think we're good, but...

8256
07:11:47,880 --> 07:11:49,440
Just to be... just in case, you know?

8257
07:11:49,840 --> 07:11:53,980
Look at him with his goat-like limbs and...

8258
07:11:55,720 --> 07:11:56,080
You?

8259
07:12:08,460 --> 07:12:10,100
I'm just following to the party.

8260
07:12:11,800 --> 07:12:13,060
I'm just following to the party.

8261
07:12:13,180 --> 07:12:14,380
I'm just following to the party.

8262
07:12:17,500 --> 07:12:18,240
Don't mind me.

8263
07:12:23,450 --> 07:12:24,290
Don't mind me.

8264
07:12:24,310 --> 07:12:25,450
I'm just following to the party.

8265
07:12:40,460 --> 07:12:41,000
Don't mind me.

8266
07:12:41,000 --> 07:12:41,000
I'm just following to the party.

8267
07:12:41,000 --> 07:12:41,420
Leave me alone!

8268
07:12:43,280 --> 07:12:47,470
But I came in with that guy.

8269
07:12:47,610 --> 07:12:48,450
He invited me.

8270
07:12:48,630 --> 07:12:51,230
He literally just led me there the entire way.

8271
07:12:53,090 --> 07:12:54,630
He led me there.

8272
07:12:54,870 --> 07:12:55,730
He led me there.

8273
07:12:57,860 --> 07:12:58,910
I was totally invited.

8274
07:13:00,730 --> 07:13:01,570
Okay, hold on.

8275
07:13:04,450 --> 07:13:05,530
I'm thinking...

8276
07:13:08,050 --> 07:13:08,450
Mm...

8277
07:13:08,450 --> 07:13:10,350
What is the thing that I can do here?

8278
07:13:13,250 --> 07:13:13,650
Hmm...

8279
07:13:14,210 --> 07:13:15,990
There's some elk... Minto is cute.

8280
07:13:16,130 --> 07:13:17,110
There's no help at all!

8281
07:13:19,290 --> 07:13:22,290
I think I had to look up a guide for this one- felt dumb afterward.

8282
07:13:26,440 --> 07:13:28,160
Oh yeah, we need a second Hirtian.

8283
07:13:28,300 --> 07:13:29,460
Why don't they like me?

8284
07:13:29,800 --> 07:13:31,760
What... shouldn't they be like, oh my god, what?

8285
07:13:32,000 --> 07:13:33,020
What are you?

8286
07:13:33,020 --> 07:13:34,220
You're so cool!

8287
07:13:34,360 --> 07:13:34,920
You're so cute!

8288
07:13:35,720 --> 07:13:37,600
And I'll be like, I'm so tiny.

8289
07:13:38,160 --> 07:13:41,900
I'm just a small alien compared to you guys.

8290
07:13:43,080 --> 07:13:44,940
At least bring a nice bottle of wine.

8291
07:13:56,000 --> 07:13:59,200
Is there a way to give a hint that won't spoil it?

8292
07:13:59,820 --> 07:14:01,320
Like a one word hint.

8293
07:14:02,100 --> 07:14:03,260
Is what I'm wondering.

8294
07:14:09,030 --> 07:14:09,570
No.

8295
07:14:21,050 --> 07:14:22,880
You can't get a bucket of water.

8296
07:14:22,960 --> 07:14:23,380
I know.

8297
07:14:36,560 --> 07:14:38,040
Outside the box.

8298
07:14:48,470 --> 07:14:50,530
A fire extinguisher on the ship.

8299
07:14:50,630 --> 07:14:51,090
I know, right?

8300
07:14:52,150 --> 07:14:53,050
I'm thinking.

8301
07:14:56,810 --> 07:14:58,110
Just pretend you're the delivery guy.

8302
07:14:58,250 --> 07:14:58,510
I know!

8303
07:14:59,470 --> 07:15:00,150
It's a me!

8304
07:15:00,310 --> 07:15:01,270
I delivered the pizza!

8305
07:15:02,550 --> 07:15:03,470
The pizza!

8306
07:15:05,190 --> 07:15:07,210
You did ironically solve this earlier.

8307
07:15:07,390 --> 07:15:08,310
I'm so... what?

8308
07:15:08,650 --> 07:15:11,950
I can't... It's been seven hours, please.

8309
07:15:12,190 --> 07:15:15,470
How am I supposed to remember everything that I've done and haven't done?

8310
07:15:20,580 --> 07:15:22,960
How am I supposed to remember everything that I've done?

8311
07:15:44,000 --> 07:15:47,060
Your brain has been working less ever since you're not as scared.

8312
07:15:47,180 --> 07:15:47,640
Oh my god!

8313
07:15:47,680 --> 07:15:48,480
Don't be so mean!

8314
07:15:49,300 --> 07:15:50,680
What are you talking about?

8315
07:15:52,220 --> 07:15:53,440
Oh my god!

8316
07:15:54,520 --> 07:15:55,520
So mean!

8317
07:15:57,280 --> 07:15:57,820
Wow!

8318
07:15:58,060 --> 07:15:59,060
Don't be rude.

8319
07:15:59,700 --> 07:16:01,120
Thanks for the gift, dude.

8320
07:16:02,560 --> 07:16:03,500
I'm thinking.

8321
07:16:03,620 --> 07:16:04,500
I'm thinking, girl.

8322
07:16:07,060 --> 07:16:08,640
First puzzle of the day.

8323
07:16:10,880 --> 07:16:12,780
Because I was thinking, I was like, does the...

8324
07:16:15,100 --> 07:16:16,320
I can't... Oh, wait.

8325
07:16:16,400 --> 07:16:16,540
Oops.

8326
07:16:16,640 --> 07:16:17,500
I forgot to do this back off.

8327
07:16:17,600 --> 07:16:21,260
I can't wait until the water because...

8328
07:16:24,080 --> 07:16:24,480
Because...

8329
07:16:25,440 --> 07:16:26,400
Unless I can.

8330
07:16:27,040 --> 07:16:28,420
I'm in a different building.

8331
07:16:32,430 --> 07:16:36,010
And that building over there, I think, doesn't get affected.

8332
07:16:37,930 --> 07:16:38,730
Oh, wrong way.

8333
07:16:41,880 --> 07:16:45,380
So maybe I can wait until the thing is destroyed.

8334
07:16:48,200 --> 07:16:51,300
Because I was thinking, oh, I can't wait for the water because it'll flood me.

8335
07:16:51,420 --> 07:16:52,940
But that's in that room.

8336
07:16:53,020 --> 07:16:56,000
This is the building across the way.

8337
07:16:56,200 --> 07:16:56,820
It should work.

8338
07:16:57,840 --> 07:16:58,560
I think.

8339
07:17:03,490 --> 07:17:03,970
Conceal.

8340
07:17:04,090 --> 07:17:04,750
Don't feel.

8341
07:17:04,930 --> 07:17:05,630
Don't let.

8342
07:17:06,510 --> 07:17:09,070
Well, I guess we're about to find out, baby!

8343
07:17:10,850 --> 07:17:11,810
Oh, shoot.

8344
07:17:11,810 --> 07:17:14,070
Wait, no, but the fire is still going to go out.

8345
07:17:15,510 --> 07:17:15,910
Ah,

8346
07:17:19,370 --> 07:17:19,690
see.

8347
07:17:22,930 --> 07:17:23,330
But...

8348
07:17:23,330 --> 07:17:24,090
Wait a second.

8349
07:17:24,170 --> 07:17:24,830
Do I...

8350
07:17:25,510 --> 07:17:26,210
Oh, wait.

8351
07:17:26,270 --> 07:17:27,790
Maybe I take a boat here or something.

8352
07:17:30,170 --> 07:17:30,830
Okay, hold on.

8353
07:17:31,130 --> 07:17:32,290
Maybe I take a boat.

8354
07:17:33,430 --> 07:17:34,270
From the tower.

8355
07:17:37,050 --> 07:17:38,830
Why am I going out the longest way?

8356
07:17:39,770 --> 07:17:42,850
Oh, come back!

8357
07:17:43,410 --> 07:17:44,210
Come back!

8358
07:17:44,330 --> 07:17:44,610
Come back!

8359
07:17:44,630 --> 07:17:45,010
Come back!

8360
07:17:51,580 --> 07:17:52,560
You're going too fast.

8361
07:17:54,260 --> 07:17:55,360
Okay, let's try it.

8362
07:18:01,940 --> 07:18:03,380
No, not the rock!

8363
07:18:05,440 --> 07:18:05,960
Dwayne.

8364
07:18:06,620 --> 07:18:08,780
Wait, is it Dwayne or the rock or Johnson?

8365
07:18:10,420 --> 07:18:10,940
Okay.

8366
07:18:10,940 --> 07:18:11,220
Okay.

8367
07:18:13,690 --> 07:18:14,310
And...

8368
07:18:19,470 --> 07:18:20,890
Put you down.

8369
07:18:21,250 --> 07:18:22,050
Take you.

8370
07:18:24,310 --> 07:18:25,130
Take you.

8371
07:18:27,290 --> 07:18:28,030
Pick up.

8372
07:18:30,590 --> 07:18:36,810
So maybe if I don't have enough time here, maybe I should start from here.

8373
07:18:39,350 --> 07:18:40,590
And then...

8374
07:18:41,250 --> 07:18:42,970
Go through the boat.

8375
07:18:42,970 --> 07:18:48,530
And like kind of wait it out until I watch them all burst into flames and disappear.

8376
07:18:49,010 --> 07:18:50,990
Well, I guess they wouldn't burst into flames.

8377
07:18:51,070 --> 07:18:51,630
But you know what I mean.

8378
07:18:55,070 --> 07:18:55,570
Okay.

8379
07:19:00,220 --> 07:19:01,140
Dwayne the rock.

8380
07:19:01,960 --> 07:19:02,460
Dwayne.

8381
07:19:03,040 --> 07:19:04,140
Dwayne or the rock.

8382
07:19:04,720 --> 07:19:06,460
Dwayne or the rock or Johnson.

8383
07:19:07,420 --> 07:19:08,140
They're brothers.

8384
07:19:16,820 --> 07:19:19,740
So that's all the hullabaloo...

8385
07:19:19,740 --> 07:19:20,500
Oh, silly.

8386
07:19:20,500 --> 07:19:23,200
All the hullabaloo we've been hearing screaming.

8387
07:19:24,060 --> 07:19:26,120
It's those guys dying.

8388
07:19:26,460 --> 07:19:26,980
Probably.

8389
07:19:27,200 --> 07:19:27,540
I hope.

8390
07:19:33,500 --> 07:19:34,060
Most likely.

8391
07:19:38,370 --> 07:19:39,950
Rock the rock Ron...

8392
07:19:40,490 --> 07:19:41,010
Rockston.

8393
07:19:46,570 --> 07:19:48,530
Dwayne or the rock or Johnson.

8394
07:19:58,580 --> 07:19:59,620
Oh my god.

8395
07:19:59,760 --> 07:20:00,420
Hold on.

8396
07:20:03,800 --> 07:20:05,020
Dwayne.

8397
07:20:05,020 --> 07:20:05,300
Rockston.

8398
07:20:05,500 --> 07:20:06,720
Dwayne.

8399
07:20:08,640 --> 07:20:11,020
Knock on wood.

8400
07:20:12,860 --> 07:20:14,220
Dwayne.

8401
07:20:14,580 --> 07:20:15,640
Dwayne.

8402
07:20:21,400 --> 07:20:22,760
Dwayne.

8403
07:20:29,310 --> 07:20:30,670
Rockston.

8404
07:20:32,010 --> 07:20:33,370
Dwayne.

8405
07:20:33,530 --> 07:20:37,330
Oh, sorry.

8406
07:20:37,330 --> 07:20:38,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

8407
07:20:38,770 --> 07:20:40,990
Unfortunately, the camera is getting all the way to the boat.

8408
07:20:40,990 --> 07:20:42,030
Pass here.

8409
07:20:44,290 --> 07:20:46,810
Oh, I like the singing, though.

8410
07:20:46,810 --> 07:20:48,210
Who was singing, I wonder?

8411
07:20:49,290 --> 07:20:52,570
Maybe the guy... the one blocking the...

8412
07:20:54,150 --> 07:20:55,450
Okay, not here.

8413
07:20:55,690 --> 07:20:56,010
Oh boy.

8414
07:20:56,230 --> 07:20:57,090
Are we gonna make it?

8415
07:20:57,570 --> 07:20:58,630
I don't know.

8416
07:20:59,110 --> 07:21:00,290
It's not here.

8417
07:21:01,470 --> 07:21:02,610
Continue onwards!

8418
07:21:05,390 --> 07:21:06,370
Forward... whoa!

8419
07:21:07,630 --> 07:21:08,870
Forward march!

8420
07:21:15,030 --> 07:21:17,630
Trying to spread Ls just to take them.

8421
07:21:22,000 --> 07:21:23,120
It's this one, right?

8422
07:21:25,540 --> 07:21:26,460
I can't tell.

8423
07:21:26,540 --> 07:21:28,040
Yes, because these are their houses, right?

8424
07:21:30,660 --> 07:21:31,400
I think?

8425
07:21:35,340 --> 07:21:36,140
Wait a second.

8426
07:21:36,760 --> 07:21:37,380
Uh-oh.

8427
07:21:37,460 --> 07:21:38,420
I just realized something.

8428
07:21:39,500 --> 07:21:40,880
Well, I can...

8429
07:21:43,320 --> 07:21:45,340
Um... Isn't there a door here?

8430
07:21:51,530 --> 07:21:52,130
Oh...

8431
07:21:52,130 --> 07:21:54,310
Wait, I can probably open it from the other side.

8432
07:22:03,550 --> 07:22:05,710
Is there a Krabby Krab anywhere?

8433
07:22:06,170 --> 07:22:06,510
Or...

8434
07:22:07,430 --> 07:22:08,030
Um...

8435
07:22:10,510 --> 07:22:11,710
No way...

8436
07:22:12,810 --> 07:22:13,910
How did we...

8437
07:22:13,910 --> 07:22:16,230
How did we fumble so hard, everybody?

8438
07:22:19,050 --> 07:22:20,050
Gotta restart!

8439
07:22:20,830 --> 07:22:22,790
How did we fumble so hard?

8440
07:22:29,130 --> 07:22:30,450
Can I jump?

8441
07:22:31,890 --> 07:22:32,490
Onto?

8442
07:22:32,950 --> 07:22:33,730
Yes, we!

8443
07:22:33,930 --> 07:22:35,270
This is a collective effort!

8444
07:22:36,250 --> 07:22:37,090
Yes, we!

8445
07:22:39,870 --> 07:22:40,830
Yes, we!

8446
07:22:40,930 --> 07:22:41,450
Yes, we!

8447
07:22:42,990 --> 07:22:43,890
We, we!

8448
07:22:43,890 --> 07:22:44,150
Yes, we, we!

8449
07:22:46,510 --> 07:22:49,850
You're going so far away from the shore, Little Boat!

8450
07:22:50,510 --> 07:22:51,090
Okay.

8451
07:22:56,090 --> 07:22:56,670
You're going so far away from the shore, Little Boat!

8452
07:22:56,670 --> 07:23:01,390
I think at this rate I should just meditate.

8453
07:23:03,390 --> 07:23:05,610
Because I can do the other.

8454
07:23:06,190 --> 07:23:07,010
Because, uh...

8455
07:23:07,010 --> 07:23:08,090
Because, uh...

8456
07:23:08,090 --> 07:23:09,750
Because I can not go any further.

8457
07:23:12,070 --> 07:23:15,730
I was going to say, I'll just go back and do it, but I cannot.

8458
07:23:17,810 --> 07:23:18,170
Okay.

8459
07:23:18,170 --> 07:23:19,070
We got this, though.

8460
07:23:19,390 --> 07:23:20,110
We got this.

8461
07:23:20,190 --> 07:23:20,630
We got this.

8462
07:23:20,710 --> 07:23:22,970
We know, hopefully, maybe the solution.

8463
07:23:23,630 --> 07:23:24,170
I think.

8464
07:23:24,430 --> 07:23:26,730
I think I have a pretty good idea of the solution.

8465
07:23:27,150 --> 07:23:27,750
I think.

8466
07:23:28,570 --> 07:23:29,330
I think so.

8467
07:23:30,870 --> 07:23:31,730
Do you trust?

8468
07:23:31,770 --> 07:23:32,530
Do you trust Minto?

8469
07:23:36,280 --> 07:23:37,200
Do you trust Minto?

8470
07:23:41,900 --> 07:23:43,600
I trust you with my afterlife.

8471
07:23:44,520 --> 07:23:45,560
Oh, my.

8472
07:23:45,580 --> 07:23:46,100
What?

8473
07:23:49,910 --> 07:23:51,210
Last, don't know what I meant.

8474
07:23:51,470 --> 07:23:53,550
You immediately thought outside of the box that one.

8475
07:23:53,650 --> 07:23:56,750
It was a no spoiler hit.

8476
07:23:56,810 --> 07:23:57,130
Sorry.

8477
07:23:57,370 --> 07:23:57,870
It's okay.

8478
07:23:58,530 --> 07:24:00,290
I accept your apology.

8479
07:24:00,770 --> 07:24:03,370
And I'm sorry if I'm a little sensitive.

8480
07:24:05,970 --> 07:24:06,750
I'm sorry.

8481
07:24:06,990 --> 07:24:08,030
I'm sorry, too.

8482
07:24:08,530 --> 07:24:09,050
Aww.

8483
07:24:10,610 --> 07:24:11,090
Hahaha.

8484
07:24:15,710 --> 07:24:18,590
We're... we're getting through this together, okay?

8485
07:24:23,860 --> 07:24:25,480
We're going to get through this together.

8486
07:24:32,100 --> 07:24:33,520
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

8487
07:24:33,580 --> 07:24:34,540
I have something to admit to.

8488
07:24:34,740 --> 07:24:36,400
I have a confession to make.

8489
07:24:37,420 --> 07:24:38,880
I have a confession to make.

8490
07:24:39,720 --> 07:24:41,500
So, Metal Gear on Saturday.

8491
07:24:41,580 --> 07:24:42,700
I stopped at...

8492
07:24:44,200 --> 07:24:45,500
At Psycho Mantis.

8493
07:24:45,980 --> 07:24:51,720
Not because I didn't think I could beat him in time for Doki's outfit.

8494
07:24:52,920 --> 07:24:58,400
But also because I was afraid to ask how to change the controller.

8495
07:24:59,360 --> 07:25:01,020
Since I didn't know how to do it.

8496
07:25:02,360 --> 07:25:03,140
Oh, we're fine.

8497
07:25:03,400 --> 07:25:04,660
All we need to do is leave.

8498
07:25:04,860 --> 07:25:06,980
Oh, I forgot my suit.

8499
07:25:08,960 --> 07:25:09,540
Oh, no.

8500
07:25:09,600 --> 07:25:10,420
I put on my suit.

8501
07:25:10,680 --> 07:25:11,820
Can I open the hatch?

8502
07:25:13,500 --> 07:25:14,080
Oh, yeah.

8503
07:25:14,140 --> 07:25:14,480
We're fine.

8504
07:25:14,600 --> 07:25:14,840
Okay.

8505
07:25:14,900 --> 07:25:15,280
Anyway.

8506
07:25:15,960 --> 07:25:17,060
I thought I was about to die.

8507
07:25:19,260 --> 07:25:21,920
This is the top three worst landing.

8508
07:25:23,120 --> 07:25:24,040
What are you talking about?

8509
07:25:24,320 --> 07:25:24,840
But, yeah.

8510
07:25:24,900 --> 07:25:25,420
I was afraid.

8511
07:25:25,720 --> 07:25:26,640
I was like...

8512
07:25:27,180 --> 07:25:29,900
I don't know how to change the controller.

8513
07:25:30,360 --> 07:25:31,660
The controller port, too.

8514
07:25:32,800 --> 07:25:35,300
I should figure that out next... by next stream.

8515
07:25:38,680 --> 07:25:39,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

8516
07:25:41,120 --> 07:25:42,000
Push, push, push.

8517
07:25:43,200 --> 07:25:43,560
Wait.

8518
07:25:43,640 --> 07:25:44,980
Is that Super Chat a spoiler?

8519
07:25:45,120 --> 07:25:46,220
I only saw part of it.

8520
07:25:46,840 --> 07:25:48,080
Is that Super Chat a spoiler?

8521
07:25:49,340 --> 07:25:49,840
Oh, no.

8522
07:25:50,020 --> 07:25:50,720
Can I read it?

8523
07:25:50,780 --> 07:25:51,280
I don't know.

8524
07:25:51,560 --> 07:25:53,160
I can't tell if I can read it or not.

8525
07:25:59,860 --> 07:26:01,460
Swap your keyboard to a different port?

8526
07:26:03,420 --> 07:26:05,300
I'm... I'm not using keyboard?

8527
07:26:08,620 --> 07:26:10,140
Oh, is there something I already solved?

8528
07:26:10,300 --> 07:26:10,620
Oh, okay.

8529
07:26:11,460 --> 07:26:12,540
I'll read it in a second.

8530
07:26:13,060 --> 07:26:14,980
Or I can read it once it pops up.

8531
07:26:16,920 --> 07:26:17,320
Wait.

8532
07:26:17,900 --> 07:26:18,300
Grab.

8533
07:26:21,640 --> 07:26:22,440
So... yeah.

8534
07:26:24,980 --> 07:26:26,640
That's why I was just like, you know what?

8535
07:26:26,740 --> 07:26:27,260
I'm gonna...

8536
07:26:27,260 --> 07:26:28,980
I was embarrassed to ask for help.

8537
07:26:33,440 --> 07:26:35,180
I was embarrassed to ask for help.

8538
07:26:35,520 --> 07:26:36,360
Oh, it's spoilers?

8539
07:26:36,840 --> 07:26:37,620
I can't tell.

8540
07:26:38,160 --> 07:26:40,520
Some people are saying it is and some people are saying it's not.

8541
07:26:41,220 --> 07:26:42,600
Well, anyway, thanks for the Super Chat.

8542
07:26:42,800 --> 07:26:42,880
Okay.

8543
07:26:59,520 --> 07:27:00,440
Fifty-fifty.

8544
07:27:03,560 --> 07:27:04,480
Bing!

8545
07:27:05,320 --> 07:27:06,860
One second nap.

8546
07:27:07,040 --> 07:27:08,080
I hope you're rested.

8547
07:27:08,560 --> 07:27:10,160
I hope you're well...

8548
07:27:11,300 --> 07:27:14,200
Feeling well and refreshed.

8549
07:27:15,420 --> 07:27:17,240
I was wondering if...

8550
07:27:17,240 --> 07:27:17,940
Okay, I'll be honest.

8551
07:27:18,060 --> 07:27:20,660
I was wondering about the door because I know how to do the door.

8552
07:27:21,280 --> 07:27:22,300
Obviously, because it's right here.

8553
07:27:23,740 --> 07:27:25,040
But I was wondering...

8554
07:27:26,400 --> 07:27:28,280
If I would have to use it.

8555
07:27:28,660 --> 07:27:30,340
Because I knew that I needed...

8556
07:27:30,340 --> 07:27:30,660
Oh, whoops.

8557
07:27:31,320 --> 07:27:34,440
I knew that I needed it for the boat.

8558
07:27:34,580 --> 07:27:35,280
But I didn't...

8559
07:27:35,280 --> 07:27:37,280
I guess I just didn't realize.

8560
07:27:37,760 --> 07:27:38,860
Okay, from here...

8561
07:27:39,360 --> 07:27:40,540
Now, we can take a boat.

8562
07:27:41,340 --> 07:27:43,600
And we can go wait in the other...

8563
07:27:43,600 --> 07:27:43,920
Oh, wait.

8564
07:27:44,800 --> 07:27:45,660
I should wake up.

8565
07:27:46,180 --> 07:27:47,140
Because I'm going to have to leave.

8566
07:27:53,080 --> 07:27:53,980
I'm going to have to leave.

8567
07:27:56,340 --> 07:27:56,900
Oh, wait.

8568
07:27:56,980 --> 07:27:57,440
Let's get the...

8569
07:27:57,440 --> 07:27:57,980
Let's do the...

8570
07:28:00,260 --> 07:28:01,340
I'm getting ahead of myself.

8571
07:28:01,560 --> 07:28:02,740
Because I got to do the bridge too.

8572
07:28:03,260 --> 07:28:03,660
Well, maybe.

8573
07:28:03,760 --> 07:28:04,420
Do I need it?

8574
07:28:05,180 --> 07:28:06,520
I'm better to have it than not.

8575
07:28:07,840 --> 07:28:09,260
Let's just do everything that we can do.

8576
07:28:11,640 --> 07:28:16,100
Do everything that we can do before we skedaddle.

8577
07:28:16,220 --> 07:28:17,800
Is it this way?

8578
07:28:21,820 --> 07:28:23,260
I can't quite remember.

8579
07:28:30,540 --> 07:28:31,020
Wait.

8580
07:28:31,120 --> 07:28:31,820
Where is it?

8581
07:28:32,380 --> 07:28:33,640
Did I not go far enough?

8582
07:28:34,300 --> 07:28:35,300
Further down, maybe?

8583
07:28:38,930 --> 07:28:39,410
Okay.

8584
07:28:40,470 --> 07:28:42,650
I'm getting all sorts of jumbled, everybody.

8585
07:28:43,350 --> 07:28:44,990
Oh, I didn't even cross the bridge.

8586
07:28:45,050 --> 07:28:46,170
I'm getting all sorts of jumbled.

8587
07:28:46,310 --> 07:28:47,130
Holy moly.

8588
07:28:48,050 --> 07:28:48,530
Okay.

8589
07:28:50,170 --> 07:28:50,870
We're good.

8590
07:28:51,790 --> 07:28:52,510
We're good.

8591
07:28:56,050 --> 07:28:56,530
Okay.

8592
07:29:00,120 --> 07:29:02,520
I think I understand what people are saying is a spoiler.

8593
07:29:02,720 --> 07:29:04,020
I have not played this game.

8594
07:29:06,180 --> 07:29:11,480
It's not so hard because people's definition of a spoiler will be different, right?

8595
07:29:11,720 --> 07:29:14,560
Like, you could think something's a spoiler and I'm like, hmm.

8596
07:29:15,260 --> 07:29:16,080
That's just...

8597
07:29:16,080 --> 07:29:16,820
That's whatever.

8598
07:29:17,500 --> 07:29:19,420
But also, I do appreciate...

8599
07:29:20,140 --> 07:29:21,860
Because if someone...

8600
07:29:21,860 --> 07:29:22,680
You know, unless I'm...

8601
07:29:22,680 --> 07:29:23,700
Unless I'm asking.

8602
07:29:25,040 --> 07:29:30,240
If someone's like, oh, have you thought about this?

8603
07:29:31,120 --> 07:29:34,220
But it's like not an answer, the actual answer.

8604
07:29:34,300 --> 07:29:42,780
And then I'm like, hey, I was able to figure out the answer because of your little hint.

8605
07:29:46,670 --> 07:29:49,190
So, but some people consider that a spoiler, you know?

8606
07:29:49,290 --> 07:29:49,890
Hmm.

8607
07:29:52,410 --> 07:29:53,250
Uh-oh.

8608
07:29:54,590 --> 07:29:55,470
Okie dokie.

8609
07:29:55,750 --> 07:30:00,450
So, I'm going to go to the tower now.

8610
07:30:01,090 --> 07:30:04,030
If I dip my toes in, does it...

8611
07:30:06,970 --> 07:30:09,410
I don't even need to dip my toes in.

8612
07:30:09,830 --> 07:30:10,510
All right.

8613
07:30:10,550 --> 07:30:11,150
Let's keep going.

8614
07:30:13,350 --> 07:30:13,910
Okay.

8615
07:30:15,130 --> 07:30:15,690
Wait.

8616
07:30:16,450 --> 07:30:17,010
Okay.

8617
07:30:19,210 --> 07:30:19,710
Okay.

8618
07:30:20,250 --> 07:30:20,790
Okay.

8619
07:30:50,890 --> 07:30:51,950
Like a little bit.

8620
07:30:52,710 --> 07:30:53,690
Just a little.

8621
07:30:54,430 --> 07:30:56,310
So that I can get my scout.

8622
07:30:59,590 --> 07:31:00,730
Okay, I'll try from here.

8623
07:31:15,700 --> 07:31:16,240
Nice!

8624
07:31:16,240 --> 07:31:16,780
75%.

8625
07:31:16,780 --> 07:31:17,980
Okay, we got plenty of time.

8626
07:31:20,360 --> 07:31:22,100
We got plenty of time.

8627
07:31:27,520 --> 07:31:27,960
Okay.

8628
07:31:28,620 --> 07:31:30,160
Now we continue onward.

8629
07:31:31,120 --> 07:31:32,000
Grab my stuff.

8630
07:31:32,480 --> 07:31:34,020
Oh, oh, oh, whoopsie.

8631
07:31:35,300 --> 07:31:39,560
I don't know if this is a spoil, but in this game, there's a time loop or something.

8632
07:31:40,400 --> 07:31:41,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

8633
07:31:43,560 --> 07:31:46,060
We haven't even reached, we haven't even gotten there yet.

8634
07:31:46,620 --> 07:31:47,060
Please.

8635
07:31:49,640 --> 07:31:52,220
It's kind of unnerving watching it count down.

8636
07:31:56,700 --> 07:31:57,960
It's just something ominous.

8637
07:31:58,000 --> 07:31:59,760
There's always something ominous about a countdown.

8638
07:32:00,060 --> 07:32:00,440
I don't know.

8639
07:32:03,060 --> 07:32:04,460
Always something like...

8640
07:32:06,220 --> 07:32:07,820
Something crazy is gonna happen.

8641
07:32:08,720 --> 07:32:09,480
I don't know.

8642
07:32:09,560 --> 07:32:10,460
Something ominous.

8643
07:32:11,880 --> 07:32:12,760
Damn, my bad.

8644
07:32:15,360 --> 07:32:17,720
You should... Yeah, there's finality, maybe.

8645
07:32:21,980 --> 07:32:23,360
Wow, that was smooth.

8646
07:32:23,920 --> 07:32:26,020
That was some smooth sailing.

8647
07:32:42,810 --> 07:32:44,890
It's starting to look a little...

8648
07:32:44,890 --> 07:32:49,090
A little questionable, you know?

8649
07:33:03,760 --> 07:33:04,560
49.

8650
07:33:11,600 --> 07:33:12,320
Hello, everybody.

8651
07:33:14,400 --> 07:33:18,900
I love... I love a group of free thinkers.

8652
07:33:19,240 --> 07:33:20,200
Or no thinkers.

8653
07:33:22,940 --> 07:33:24,560
I love no thinking.

8654
07:33:24,940 --> 07:33:29,420
Yes, I would like to also join the no thinking cult, please.

8655
07:33:30,440 --> 07:33:32,680
Yes, I don't want to think of her again.

8656
07:33:33,300 --> 07:33:35,120
Yes, take me with...

8657
07:33:35,120 --> 07:33:37,180
Take me with you.

8658
07:33:37,860 --> 07:33:39,040
Take me with you.

8659
07:33:39,160 --> 07:33:39,960
Take me with you.

8660
07:33:40,140 --> 07:33:41,500
I offer myself.

8661
07:33:42,100 --> 07:33:43,400
I'm gonna be like that guy.

8662
07:33:54,840 --> 07:33:55,800
No thought.

8663
07:33:56,100 --> 07:33:57,060
No thought.

8664
07:34:00,220 --> 07:34:03,780
There is one place open and I've very much been wondering.

8665
07:34:03,920 --> 07:34:05,020
I thought it was...

8666
07:34:05,020 --> 07:34:06,940
Maybe a guy in here.

8667
07:34:07,240 --> 07:34:09,760
But now we know why they are all in here.

8668
07:34:10,380 --> 07:34:11,920
So now I'm thinking...

8669
07:34:11,920 --> 07:34:15,040
It's the guy with the cracked antler.

8670
07:34:15,740 --> 07:34:18,060
Because they scratched out his face on the wall.

8671
07:34:19,120 --> 07:34:21,620
They... They... That guy... That guy is...

8672
07:34:21,620 --> 07:34:23,460
That guy thinks too much.

8673
07:34:24,000 --> 07:34:24,720
I think.

8674
07:34:25,500 --> 07:34:26,160
Oh no.

8675
07:34:26,280 --> 07:34:26,680
Oh no.

8676
07:34:26,760 --> 07:34:27,600
I'm gonna get kicked out.

8677
07:34:27,640 --> 07:34:28,140
I just thought.

8678
07:34:28,140 --> 07:34:29,340
Uh oh.

8679
07:34:30,820 --> 07:34:32,220
I'm gonna get kicked out of the club.

8680
07:34:37,000 --> 07:34:38,340
That guy was just like...

8681
07:34:38,340 --> 07:34:40,600
Look, we can't live in Sword Art Online.

8682
07:34:41,440 --> 07:34:43,560
We have to... You know, our planet is gone.

8683
07:34:43,640 --> 07:34:45,100
We have to experience...

8684
07:34:46,680 --> 07:34:47,420
Other stuff.

8685
07:34:47,740 --> 07:34:48,220
And they were like...

8686
07:34:48,220 --> 07:34:49,520
No, we love our planet.

8687
07:34:50,420 --> 07:34:52,100
Reject new, embrace old.

8688
07:34:58,520 --> 07:34:58,960
Alright.

8689
07:35:08,840 --> 07:35:10,520
It sucks that we can't see the...

8690
07:35:10,520 --> 07:35:12,360
Um... Integrity of the...

8691
07:35:18,020 --> 07:35:18,420
Okay.

8692
07:35:18,660 --> 07:35:20,220
We're just gonna take it easy for now.

8693
07:35:20,700 --> 07:35:21,100
Until...

8694
07:35:24,980 --> 07:35:26,320
What about the boat candles?

8695
07:35:26,600 --> 07:35:27,420
Wait, you can do that?

8696
07:35:29,100 --> 07:35:29,940
You actually can.

8697
07:35:31,500 --> 07:35:31,900
Ooh.

8698
07:35:32,300 --> 07:35:34,620
But then... I think that's what's lighting this partially, right?

8699
07:35:35,720 --> 07:35:37,600
I don't think it'll move at all if we...

8700
07:35:37,600 --> 07:35:38,340
Blow them out.

8701
07:35:41,680 --> 07:35:42,520
We're just cruising.

8702
07:35:44,560 --> 07:35:46,300
Oh yeah, we'll know when it comes.

8703
07:35:46,460 --> 07:35:49,140
Those guys are gonna be screaming, hollering, hoopla.

8704
07:35:49,840 --> 07:35:50,980
So much happening.

8705
07:35:57,540 --> 07:35:58,860
Why does it feel shorter?

8706
07:36:00,220 --> 07:36:00,660
Hmm.

8707
07:36:04,340 --> 07:36:05,720
I'm getting... I'm getting restless.

8708
07:36:12,920 --> 07:36:13,880
I guess we can...

8709
07:36:13,880 --> 07:36:15,020
Maybe still go over there.

8710
07:36:17,720 --> 07:36:18,160
Hmm.

8711
07:36:20,120 --> 07:36:21,760
I think the first time I heard that...

8712
07:36:21,760 --> 07:36:22,600
Some scream...

8713
07:36:22,600 --> 07:36:24,080
From the...

8714
07:36:24,080 --> 07:36:25,560
Or from the dam...

8715
07:36:26,240 --> 07:36:26,700
Exploding...

8716
07:36:27,260 --> 07:36:28,900
Was when I was on the boat, actually.

8717
07:36:28,980 --> 07:36:29,960
And I was like, why'd they scream?

8718
07:36:40,460 --> 07:36:40,920
Meow.

8719
07:36:41,680 --> 07:36:42,140
Meow.

8720
07:36:42,740 --> 07:36:45,120
Pretty sure BGA Final Fantasy Tactics...

8721
07:36:45,120 --> 07:36:45,940
There it is.

8722
07:36:46,960 --> 07:36:51,260
Did it with the main cast getting sucked inside a book in the MC Adventure to free everyone.

8723
07:36:53,400 --> 07:36:54,480
Alright, we're zooming!

8724
07:36:54,500 --> 07:36:54,980
We're zooming!

8725
07:36:58,720 --> 07:36:59,160
Oh!

8726
07:36:59,780 --> 07:37:00,660
There they are!

8727
07:37:00,740 --> 07:37:01,400
There they go!

8728
07:37:01,500 --> 07:37:02,240
Did you see that?

8729
07:37:03,240 --> 07:37:04,580
I just saw them dissolve.

8730
07:37:04,900 --> 07:37:05,680
I just saw them...

8731
07:37:05,680 --> 07:37:05,860
Yeah!

8732
07:37:06,040 --> 07:37:07,540
We just saw them burst into flame!

8733
07:37:08,560 --> 07:37:09,000
Yeah!

8734
07:37:12,660 --> 07:37:14,320
Oh, we're slanted a little bit.

8735
07:37:14,680 --> 07:37:15,480
Oh, oh, oh.

8736
07:37:22,850 --> 07:37:23,290
Yeah!

8737
07:37:28,670 --> 07:37:29,510
They're dead!

8738
07:37:29,690 --> 07:37:30,270
They're dead!

8739
07:37:31,410 --> 07:37:31,850
Wait.

8740
07:37:32,010 --> 07:37:32,690
Oh, here we go.

8741
07:37:33,350 --> 07:37:33,790
Haha.

8742
07:37:34,890 --> 07:37:35,810
They're all dead!

8743
07:37:38,830 --> 07:37:39,270
Wait.

8744
07:37:39,330 --> 07:37:40,030
Are they all dead?

8745
07:37:40,270 --> 07:37:41,030
I guess...

8746
07:37:42,330 --> 07:37:43,410
We'll still be careful.

8747
07:37:44,010 --> 07:37:45,050
We'll still be careful.

8748
07:37:46,550 --> 07:37:47,410
Just in case.

8749
07:37:53,560 --> 07:37:54,000
Dead.

8750
07:37:54,240 --> 07:37:54,560
Dead.

8751
07:37:54,620 --> 07:37:54,780
Oh!

8752
07:37:55,120 --> 07:37:55,920
That's my boat.

8753
07:37:56,600 --> 07:37:57,880
I was like, oh my god!

8754
07:37:57,940 --> 07:37:58,560
They're not all dead!

8755
07:38:07,660 --> 07:38:10,880
Because there could have been someone visiting from the tower, you know?

8756
07:38:12,380 --> 07:38:14,500
I think the tower is the only one that's...

8757
07:38:15,000 --> 07:38:15,440
Good.

8758
07:38:19,840 --> 07:38:20,280
Oh.

8759
07:38:20,340 --> 07:38:20,680
Wait.

8760
07:38:20,800 --> 07:38:20,920
No.

8761
07:38:20,980 --> 07:38:21,940
That's the night sky.

8762
07:38:22,980 --> 07:38:23,580
I believe.

8763
07:38:23,700 --> 07:38:23,920
Yeah.

8764
07:38:25,280 --> 07:38:26,340
The night sky?

8765
07:38:31,620 --> 07:38:32,060
Okay.

8766
07:38:34,140 --> 07:38:34,840
Good thing...

8767
07:38:36,620 --> 07:38:38,340
Good thing I set up the bridge.

8768
07:38:40,960 --> 07:38:43,320
Now I don't quite remember how to get in there.

8769
07:38:43,980 --> 07:38:44,420
Uh...

8770
07:38:45,400 --> 07:38:46,340
I wish I...

8771
07:38:46,920 --> 07:38:47,360
Um...

8772
07:38:47,360 --> 07:38:48,120
I wish there was a...

8773
07:38:48,640 --> 07:38:49,080
Wait.

8774
07:38:49,120 --> 07:38:49,700
There is a path.

8775
07:38:49,840 --> 07:38:49,900
There is a...

8776
07:38:49,900 --> 07:38:49,940
There is a path.

8777
07:38:50,060 --> 07:38:50,420
Right?

8778
07:38:54,280 --> 07:38:55,900
That I'll eventually run into.

8779
07:38:57,920 --> 07:38:58,660
Right there.

8780
07:39:01,220 --> 07:39:02,000
There we go.

8781
07:39:05,640 --> 07:39:08,100
That I'll eventually run into.

8782
07:39:09,700 --> 07:39:10,220
Uh...

8783
07:39:11,720 --> 07:39:12,240
Uh...

8784
07:39:12,240 --> 07:39:13,260
Huh?

8785
07:39:14,200 --> 07:39:14,720
Wait.

8786
07:39:14,780 --> 07:39:15,180
What is this?

8787
07:39:18,670 --> 07:39:19,310
Where is...

8788
07:39:19,310 --> 07:39:19,550
Oh!

8789
07:39:19,810 --> 07:39:20,170
No!

8790
07:39:20,390 --> 07:39:21,450
This is not where I wanted to go!

8791
07:39:21,830 --> 07:39:22,850
I'm all backwards.

8792
07:39:24,330 --> 07:39:24,850
Oh!

8793
07:39:24,870 --> 07:39:25,590
I didn't use the glitch.

8794
07:39:25,710 --> 07:39:26,170
Oh yeah.

8795
07:39:26,390 --> 07:39:27,170
I'll try that.

8796
07:39:34,770 --> 07:39:35,210
Oh!

8797
07:39:35,410 --> 07:39:37,050
It's really scary going into pitch.

8798
07:39:37,830 --> 07:39:38,270
Wah!

8799
07:39:38,710 --> 07:39:39,150
Oh.

8800
07:39:39,630 --> 07:39:40,070
Okay.

8801
07:39:40,630 --> 07:39:41,630
Where is it?

8802
07:39:42,450 --> 07:39:45,230
Actually, I'm gonna go see if there's anybody left too.

8803
07:39:47,710 --> 07:39:48,790
I'm gonna go check.

8804
07:39:49,110 --> 07:39:50,350
Where the heck is this hole?

8805
07:39:51,330 --> 07:39:52,710
It's a hole in the ground.

8806
07:39:52,890 --> 07:39:53,190
It should be...

8807
07:39:53,190 --> 07:39:53,350
So...

8808
07:39:53,350 --> 07:39:53,610
Oh!

8809
07:39:53,710 --> 07:39:54,050
There it is.

8810
07:39:55,370 --> 07:39:56,990
I'm stuck pulling a double at work.

8811
07:39:57,270 --> 07:39:59,030
It's awesome having your stream to keep me company.

8812
07:39:59,270 --> 07:39:59,710
Oh!

8813
07:39:59,710 --> 07:40:00,010
Peg!

8814
07:40:00,070 --> 07:40:00,150
Oh!

8815
07:40:00,170 --> 07:40:01,090
I'm stuck pulling a double at work!

8816
07:40:02,230 --> 07:40:04,430
You seem to be suffering more than me at this point.

8817
07:40:04,570 --> 07:40:04,590
Hey.

8818
07:40:04,730 --> 07:40:04,790
Hey.

8819
07:40:07,290 --> 07:40:08,110
I'm all right.

8820
07:40:08,850 --> 07:40:09,570
We're okay.

8821
07:40:09,850 --> 07:40:10,510
We're okay.

8822
07:40:11,370 --> 07:40:13,150
I think we just solved a puzzle.

8823
07:40:16,330 --> 07:40:18,730
I'm gonna go make sure that there's nobody in here.

8824
07:40:30,540 --> 07:40:31,000
That's it?

8825
07:40:32,340 --> 07:40:32,700
Nice.

8826
07:40:32,800 --> 07:40:33,040
Okay.

8827
07:40:33,660 --> 07:40:34,200
All right.

8828
07:40:34,260 --> 07:40:34,480
Cool.

8829
07:40:34,600 --> 07:40:34,700
Cool.

8830
07:40:34,820 --> 07:40:35,000
Cool.

8831
07:40:35,060 --> 07:40:35,240
Cool.

8832
07:40:35,280 --> 07:40:35,380
Cool.

8833
07:40:35,680 --> 07:40:35,720
Cool.

8834
07:40:35,720 --> 07:40:36,040
Cool.

8835
07:40:38,280 --> 07:40:38,640
Cool.

8836
07:40:39,220 --> 07:40:39,580
Cool.

8837
07:40:39,600 --> 07:40:40,400
We're all good.

8838
07:40:40,760 --> 07:40:41,480
I think.

8839
07:40:41,640 --> 07:40:42,140
I hope.

8840
07:40:43,340 --> 07:40:43,820
Oh.

8841
07:40:43,840 --> 07:40:44,100
Whoops.

8842
07:40:44,200 --> 07:40:44,940
Definitely dead.

8843
07:40:46,280 --> 07:40:46,760
Donezo.

8844
07:40:47,440 --> 07:40:48,340
They're all gone!

8845
07:40:49,720 --> 07:40:50,780
You need the lantern.

8846
07:40:50,920 --> 07:40:51,180
I know.

8847
07:40:51,260 --> 07:40:51,540
That's...

8848
07:40:51,540 --> 07:40:52,300
I'm gonna go get...

8849
07:40:52,300 --> 07:40:52,720
I was...

8850
07:40:52,720 --> 07:40:53,020
I...

8851
07:40:53,520 --> 07:40:57,380
I literally said I'm going to go check to see if everybody's dead first.

8852
07:40:58,660 --> 07:40:59,180
That's all.

8853
07:41:00,480 --> 07:41:01,720
That's all I wanted to do.

8854
07:41:04,800 --> 07:41:05,560
Here we go.

8855
07:41:08,980 --> 07:41:09,620
Pick up.

8856
07:41:10,160 --> 07:41:10,640
Okay.

8857
07:41:11,240 --> 07:41:11,720
Okay.

8858
07:41:11,740 --> 07:41:12,240
Don't worry guys.

8859
07:41:12,500 --> 07:41:12,840
I know.

8860
07:41:14,060 --> 07:41:14,720
Is it here?

8861
07:41:14,900 --> 07:41:15,500
Is it this one?

8862
07:41:16,540 --> 07:41:17,380
Is it this here?

8863
07:41:17,480 --> 07:41:18,000
Is it this one?

8864
07:41:19,500 --> 07:41:19,900
No.

8865
07:41:20,780 --> 07:41:21,520
Oh my god.

8866
07:41:21,720 --> 07:41:22,440
I can't...

8867
07:41:22,440 --> 07:41:22,620
Wait.

8868
07:41:22,660 --> 07:41:22,860
Here?

8869
07:41:23,160 --> 07:41:23,560
Here.

8870
07:41:25,480 --> 07:41:25,880
Yaso!

8871
07:41:31,580 --> 07:41:31,980
Awesome.

8872
07:41:32,100 --> 07:41:32,340
Awesome.

8873
07:41:32,460 --> 07:41:32,620
Awesome.

8874
07:41:33,240 --> 07:41:33,640
Awesome.

8875
07:41:34,880 --> 07:41:37,120
That's why the guys didn't die in the other one too.

8876
07:41:38,280 --> 07:41:38,960
Makes sense.

8877
07:41:40,140 --> 07:41:40,920
Makes sense.

8878
07:41:41,080 --> 07:41:41,620
Makes sense.

8879
07:41:41,640 --> 07:41:43,220
Because they were in that high up building.

8880
07:41:44,760 --> 07:41:45,160
Right.

8881
07:41:48,960 --> 07:41:49,800
Okay.

8882
07:41:49,800 --> 07:41:51,240
Thanks for the preach!

8883
07:41:51,860 --> 07:41:53,420
I just walk on in?

8884
07:41:55,200 --> 07:41:56,040
Cool.

8885
07:42:02,710 --> 07:42:04,170
Here we go!

8886
07:42:07,310 --> 07:42:08,790
Here we go!

8887
07:42:08,790 --> 07:42:09,010
Wow!

8888
07:42:15,230 --> 07:42:17,130
Are those eyes or...

8889
07:42:18,230 --> 07:42:22,510
Those are lanterns.

8890
07:42:27,800 --> 07:42:28,400
Oh, okay.

8891
07:42:28,500 --> 07:42:29,740
Those are the... Okay, okay, okay.

8892
07:42:31,780 --> 07:42:32,760
Artifact does not fit!

8893
07:42:38,240 --> 07:42:38,700
Okay.

8894
07:42:38,700 --> 07:42:41,520
This one's a bit more peculiar, eh?

8895
07:42:41,640 --> 07:42:44,380
Oh, now we're going to be all mysterious and interesting?

8896
07:42:45,440 --> 07:42:46,280
Oh, awesome.

8897
07:43:02,390 --> 07:43:03,670
Let's see what we can do here.

8898
07:43:08,550 --> 07:43:08,970
Well...

8899
07:43:15,730 --> 07:43:17,270
Well, the artifact goes in here, right?

8900
07:43:17,330 --> 07:43:17,930
And then...

8901
07:43:18,530 --> 07:43:19,970
How do we get these, though?

8902
07:43:20,470 --> 07:43:21,390
Is my question.

8903
07:43:22,710 --> 07:43:23,270
Let's see.

8904
07:43:24,670 --> 07:43:25,870
Mint, what are you talking about?

8905
07:43:29,350 --> 07:43:30,670
We can't even get to them!

8906
07:43:30,670 --> 07:43:31,830
Minto, please!

8907
07:43:36,990 --> 07:43:39,210
I forgot it opened the door.

8908
07:43:43,170 --> 07:43:44,370
I don't remember now.

8909
07:43:50,380 --> 07:43:51,290
Thanks for the raid!

8910
07:43:52,230 --> 07:43:52,850
Slippy!

8911
07:43:53,710 --> 07:43:54,570
Thank you!

8912
07:43:56,290 --> 07:43:57,310
Okay, here we go.

8913
07:43:57,970 --> 07:43:58,410
Ooh!

8914
07:44:00,730 --> 07:44:02,050
The eye sucks!

8915
07:44:02,210 --> 07:44:04,590
The eye's going to destroy everything.

8916
07:44:07,290 --> 07:44:09,230
He sees everything from the eye.

8917
07:44:09,430 --> 07:44:09,930
Oh, my God.

8918
07:44:10,090 --> 07:44:10,310
Whoa!

8919
07:44:11,590 --> 07:44:12,030
Whoa!

8920
07:44:12,130 --> 07:44:13,050
The eye's awesome!

8921
07:44:15,250 --> 07:44:15,690
Wow!

8922
07:44:15,890 --> 07:44:17,110
Everybody, come look at the eye!

8923
07:44:17,590 --> 07:44:18,010
Where are we?

8924
07:44:18,050 --> 07:44:18,530
Thanks for the gifted!

8925
07:44:19,530 --> 07:44:20,290
Oh, oh, oh!

8926
07:44:20,390 --> 07:44:21,330
Eye, eye, eye, eye!

8927
07:44:21,410 --> 07:44:22,470
Eye, eye, eye, eye!

8928
07:44:22,590 --> 07:44:23,030
Eye!

8929
07:44:23,910 --> 07:44:24,290
Eye!

8930
07:44:24,290 --> 07:44:24,470
Eye!

8931
07:44:25,130 --> 07:44:26,970
That's everybody reaching up for Minto!

8932
07:44:27,930 --> 07:44:28,490
Spank!

8933
07:44:28,490 --> 07:44:29,210
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

8934
07:44:30,110 --> 07:44:30,670
We...

8935
07:44:32,330 --> 07:44:33,630
We love the eye!

8936
07:44:33,890 --> 07:44:34,650
We love the eye!

8937
07:44:34,930 --> 07:44:35,070
Oh!

8938
07:44:36,590 --> 07:44:38,970
They destroyed their own planet!

8939
07:44:41,010 --> 07:44:45,530
They destroyed their own home to build this thing to go search for the eye!

8940
07:44:53,290 --> 07:44:55,470
So they don't even have a place to go back!

8941
07:44:56,350 --> 07:44:57,950
Oh, you idiots!

8942
07:44:59,150 --> 07:45:00,510
You didn't even...

8943
07:45:01,170 --> 07:45:02,090
Oh, my God!

8944
07:45:02,310 --> 07:45:03,170
That's so sad!

8945
07:45:10,470 --> 07:45:11,790
Oopsie-daisy!

8946
07:45:13,030 --> 07:45:14,530
Whoopsie-poopsie is right!

8947
07:45:16,290 --> 07:45:17,170
Digital...

8948
07:45:17,170 --> 07:45:18,790
Digital world!

8949
07:45:19,970 --> 07:45:20,850
Digimon!

8950
07:45:23,250 --> 07:45:24,250
The strangers!

8951
07:45:24,350 --> 07:45:25,390
Stranger aliens!

8952
07:45:26,150 --> 07:45:27,570
Digital stranger aliens!

8953
07:45:27,570 --> 07:45:27,730
Digital stranger aliens!

8954
07:45:29,290 --> 07:45:31,390
He's going along the little...

8955
07:45:31,390 --> 07:45:33,690
Down, down, down by the...

8956
07:45:35,170 --> 07:45:35,650
River...

8957
07:45:36,250 --> 07:45:36,910
Oh, yeah!

8958
07:45:37,070 --> 07:45:37,550
Okay!

8959
07:45:37,730 --> 07:45:38,370
Oh, my gosh!

8960
07:45:39,570 --> 07:45:45,210
To me, I was just like, oh, it's cool that they go through the caves to, like...

8961
07:45:45,210 --> 07:45:48,330
You know, but it's in pitch black, so it, like, helps load the next area.

8962
07:45:48,450 --> 07:45:49,430
But that's literally...

8963
07:45:50,450 --> 07:45:52,890
That's literally their game as well.

8964
07:45:54,350 --> 07:45:55,630
It's just a loading...

8965
07:45:55,630 --> 07:45:56,550
It's just a...

8966
07:46:04,440 --> 07:46:05,320
Oh, boy!

8967
07:46:06,100 --> 07:46:06,860
Oh, my gosh!

8968
07:46:06,900 --> 07:46:08,020
I can't wait to try this!

8969
07:46:08,900 --> 07:46:09,640
Oh, my gosh!

8970
07:46:09,660 --> 07:46:11,320
We're gonna go in the boat and then...

8971
07:46:11,760 --> 07:46:14,940
Okay, that's kind of fun.

8972
07:46:15,140 --> 07:46:15,920
Let's go try that.

8973
07:46:18,140 --> 07:46:19,640
If you die in the game...

8974
07:46:19,640 --> 07:46:20,360
Nah!

8975
07:46:23,740 --> 07:46:24,520
Oh, man!

8976
07:46:28,880 --> 07:46:30,020
We're no-clipping!

8977
07:46:33,200 --> 07:46:33,800
Oh, my gosh!

8978
07:46:33,820 --> 07:46:34,580
This is so exciting!

8979
07:46:36,000 --> 07:46:36,720
Uh, oh.

8980
07:46:40,420 --> 07:46:40,780
Okay.

8981
07:46:40,780 --> 07:46:41,720
Now, we...

8982
07:46:42,400 --> 07:46:43,880
Go all the way to the ship.

8983
07:46:45,480 --> 07:46:45,840
Actually...

8984
07:46:46,740 --> 07:46:48,140
How do we get to the ship?

8985
07:46:48,220 --> 07:46:48,560
Uh...

8986
07:46:48,560 --> 07:46:49,520
No, I know.

8987
07:46:49,660 --> 07:46:50,160
I know.

8988
07:46:50,900 --> 07:46:51,660
Don't worry, I know.

8989
07:46:52,900 --> 07:46:53,260
Okay.

8990
07:46:57,480 --> 07:46:58,620
This one's really cool.

8991
07:46:58,720 --> 07:46:59,160
Oh, my gosh!

8992
07:46:59,180 --> 07:46:59,560
I'm so excited.

8993
07:46:59,720 --> 07:47:02,260
Wait, so, will each loading area also have...

8994
07:47:02,920 --> 07:47:03,280
A...

8995
07:47:04,440 --> 07:47:04,800
Um...

8996
07:47:05,620 --> 07:47:06,020
Different...

8997
07:47:06,780 --> 07:47:07,860
Thing going on?

8998
07:47:07,920 --> 07:47:08,800
I'm so curious!

8999
07:47:09,340 --> 07:47:10,820
I'm so excited to try this out.

9000
07:47:10,900 --> 07:47:11,680
I hope we have time.

9001
07:47:11,820 --> 07:47:12,780
If we don't have time...

9002
07:47:12,780 --> 07:47:14,260
The next loop, obviously.

9003
07:47:16,020 --> 07:47:16,420
Hehehe.

9004
07:47:17,980 --> 07:47:19,120
Uh, where's the bridge?

9005
07:47:20,480 --> 07:47:21,180
Over this way?

9006
07:47:22,140 --> 07:47:23,020
I was wondering.

9007
07:47:23,140 --> 07:47:25,120
Like, in the... in the, um, little...

9008
07:47:27,680 --> 07:47:28,800
In their little...

9009
07:47:30,560 --> 07:47:31,100
What was that?

9010
07:47:31,200 --> 07:47:31,960
Did I say it over here?

9011
07:47:32,860 --> 07:47:33,600
In their...

9012
07:47:33,600 --> 07:47:36,940
In the slideshow, it showed that they had, like, fish and stuff in their...

9013
07:47:36,940 --> 07:47:38,060
In their rivers.

9014
07:47:38,160 --> 07:47:38,900
And I was wondering...

9015
07:47:38,900 --> 07:47:41,860
Before we knew that this was a simulation, I was like, I wonder...

9016
07:47:42,460 --> 07:47:43,540
Where are their...

9017
07:47:43,540 --> 07:47:44,540
Uh, like, the...

9018
07:47:44,540 --> 07:47:47,200
Some of the sounds we're hearing are other animals or something.

9019
07:47:50,560 --> 07:47:52,500
Gosh, it's really hard to navigate through here.

9020
07:47:59,100 --> 07:48:00,540
How the hell do I get home?

9021
07:48:05,020 --> 07:48:05,420
I...

9022
07:48:05,980 --> 07:48:07,120
I can't find the bridge!

9023
07:48:08,020 --> 07:48:09,140
The girl is so...

9024
07:48:09,140 --> 07:48:11,420
I'm very... I'm really lost, yeah.

9025
07:48:12,020 --> 07:48:13,180
I'm pretty lost.

9026
07:48:15,040 --> 07:48:16,560
I'm pretty lost, yeah!

9027
07:48:16,700 --> 07:48:17,940
I don't know where to go!

9028
07:48:18,860 --> 07:48:20,240
I'm... I'm trapped!

9029
07:48:24,840 --> 07:48:25,360
Oh!

9030
07:48:25,520 --> 07:48:25,820
Oh!

9031
07:48:25,940 --> 07:48:26,160
Oh!

9032
07:48:26,600 --> 07:48:27,480
Oh, thank goodness.

9033
07:48:28,720 --> 07:48:29,240
Okay.

9034
07:48:29,360 --> 07:48:30,280
We found it.

9035
07:48:30,460 --> 07:48:31,480
We found...

9036
07:48:31,480 --> 07:48:32,580
We found it.

9037
07:48:32,780 --> 07:48:35,140
Wait, so, then probably...

9038
07:48:37,020 --> 07:48:37,760
I'm silly.

9039
07:48:38,620 --> 07:48:39,140
Probably...

9040
07:48:40,380 --> 07:48:41,920
I have to...

9041
07:48:44,500 --> 07:48:45,020
Um...

9042
07:48:45,020 --> 07:48:46,680
Blow out the candles then, right?

9043
07:48:47,380 --> 07:48:47,900
Actually?

9044
07:48:54,580 --> 07:48:55,620
There's a hand here.

9045
07:48:58,240 --> 07:48:59,720
But why can't I...

9046
07:49:00,300 --> 07:49:01,420
Was there another hand?

9047
07:49:01,500 --> 07:49:02,040
I just missed it.

9048
07:49:06,570 --> 07:49:07,090
Hm?

9049
07:49:08,370 --> 07:49:08,890
Hm?

9050
07:49:11,910 --> 07:49:12,910
Just a silly.

9051
07:49:20,330 --> 07:49:21,470
One-way shortcut.

9052
07:49:22,650 --> 07:49:23,690
Oh, wait.

9053
07:49:23,790 --> 07:49:23,910
What?

9054
07:49:24,010 --> 07:49:24,370
That sucks.

9055
07:49:24,990 --> 07:49:26,930
Oh, I see it now though!

9056
07:49:27,210 --> 07:49:28,230
Oh, I see it, I see it.

9057
07:49:28,390 --> 07:49:28,550
Oh.

9058
07:49:29,690 --> 07:49:30,150
Okay.

9059
07:49:31,370 --> 07:49:31,830
Well...

9060
07:49:34,070 --> 07:49:34,910
Do a flip!

9061
07:49:37,870 --> 07:49:39,070
No, I can...

9062
07:49:40,510 --> 07:49:41,690
Wait, I think that's the music.

9063
07:49:44,010 --> 07:49:44,930
I think...

9064
07:49:46,030 --> 07:49:47,090
Maybe that was it?

9065
07:49:47,090 --> 07:49:48,370
No?

9066
07:49:48,710 --> 07:49:50,030
I thought I heard the...

9067
07:49:53,750 --> 07:49:55,330
But not yet.

9068
07:49:57,030 --> 07:49:58,310
Not yet.

9069
07:49:59,530 --> 07:50:01,110
Not yet, Snake.

9070
07:50:03,430 --> 07:50:04,310
No,

9071
07:50:07,960 --> 07:50:08,880
it's just ambience.

9072
07:50:10,940 --> 07:50:12,500
It's just ambience.

9073
07:50:20,860 --> 07:50:22,120
To the hole.

9074
07:50:23,180 --> 07:50:24,360
With the boats.

9075
07:50:25,680 --> 07:50:26,600
I see!

9076
07:50:27,890 --> 07:50:28,380
Oh, oh.

9077
07:50:28,420 --> 07:50:28,900
Oh.

9078
07:50:29,220 --> 07:50:30,880
Not to the hole with the boats.

9079
07:50:33,640 --> 07:50:34,300
Anyway.

9080
07:50:35,870 --> 07:50:36,460
Let's meditate.

9081
07:50:38,850 --> 07:50:40,960
I don't know if you can actually...

9082
07:50:40,960 --> 07:50:41,660
Is it...

9083
07:50:41,660 --> 07:50:44,820
I don't know if meditating under the water is like...

9084
07:50:46,000 --> 07:50:47,200
Is possible.

9085
07:50:48,820 --> 07:50:49,480
Okay.

9086
07:50:56,170 --> 07:50:56,370
Um...

9087
07:50:57,890 --> 07:50:59,710
Thinking if I should get some more water.

9088
07:51:00,330 --> 07:51:02,270
I think that's just called drowning.

9089
07:51:02,410 --> 07:51:02,870
I think so too!

9090
07:51:09,240 --> 07:51:10,940
Everything is so green.

9091
07:51:14,940 --> 07:51:16,240
Good morning world!

9092
07:51:17,500 --> 07:51:19,100
Oh, to be a Hearthian.

9093
07:51:20,660 --> 07:51:22,780
My mind is so expanded.

9094
07:51:23,080 --> 07:51:27,060
Not a single Hearthian here can understand what I'm going through.

9095
07:51:27,600 --> 07:51:29,460
Nobody here gets me anymore.

9096
07:51:29,460 --> 07:51:31,620
I don't even feel...

9097
07:51:33,460 --> 07:51:34,760
I don't feel...

9098
07:51:35,580 --> 07:51:37,660
I don't feel hurt.

9099
07:51:37,800 --> 07:51:38,200
I don't...

9100
07:51:41,200 --> 07:51:43,680
You guys, I'm beyond saving.

9101
07:51:45,480 --> 07:51:46,520
They're just like...

9102
07:51:46,520 --> 07:51:46,760
I don't...

9103
07:51:46,760 --> 07:51:48,940
They're like, gosh, what's wrong with them?

9104
07:51:49,100 --> 07:51:49,820
They just...

9105
07:51:49,820 --> 07:51:52,060
They wake up and they just take off.

9106
07:51:52,320 --> 07:51:54,560
They don't even say hello, goodbye, anything.

9107
07:51:55,100 --> 07:51:56,020
They just...

9108
07:51:56,020 --> 07:51:59,440
They literally just run to their ship and just take off into space.

9109
07:51:59,440 --> 07:52:00,400
Like they're a...

9110
07:52:00,400 --> 07:52:01,260
Like they're a...

9111
07:52:02,060 --> 07:52:02,940
A natural.

9112
07:52:03,060 --> 07:52:05,340
Like they've been doing this since they were in the womb.

9113
07:52:06,160 --> 07:52:07,100
What am I?

9114
07:52:07,280 --> 07:52:08,560
Who am I?

9115
07:52:13,780 --> 07:52:14,660
Brain maxing.

9116
07:52:14,860 --> 07:52:15,920
I gotta get back.

9117
07:52:16,020 --> 07:52:16,960
I know, I'm just like...

9118
07:52:16,960 --> 07:52:18,700
I gotta go into the void.

9119
07:52:19,560 --> 07:52:22,400
I gotta go into the void of the...

9120
07:52:22,400 --> 07:52:24,080
I'm so excited to see what's in here.

9121
07:52:24,220 --> 07:52:29,320
Oh my gosh, you guys don't even know how excited I am to see what's in the void.

9122
07:52:30,320 --> 07:52:32,420
So much so that I did a perfect landing.

9123
07:52:32,600 --> 07:52:33,180
Let's go.

9124
07:52:34,160 --> 07:52:34,640
Yoink.

9125
07:52:35,760 --> 07:52:38,260
I'm also just very excited to be past those parts.

9126
07:52:38,840 --> 07:52:42,600
If there's more stealth, I'm sure that's fine.

9127
07:52:42,940 --> 07:52:46,540
But I'm very excited to be past those parts.

9128
07:52:46,640 --> 07:52:48,740
It has reinvigorated me.

9129
07:52:51,860 --> 07:52:53,560
We'll just go to the first one we can.

9130
07:52:53,920 --> 07:52:55,600
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

9131
07:52:55,720 --> 07:52:56,020
Whee.

9132
07:52:56,600 --> 07:52:57,080
Bunga.

9133
07:53:01,960 --> 07:53:02,400
Hehehe.

9134
07:53:04,680 --> 07:53:06,420
AI says we are concerned.

9135
07:53:06,920 --> 07:53:08,120
What are you concerned about, huh?

9136
07:53:08,240 --> 07:53:09,320
Tell me your problems.

9137
07:53:09,880 --> 07:53:10,980
I can help you.

9138
07:53:11,260 --> 07:53:12,540
What are your problems?

9139
07:53:12,800 --> 07:53:14,200
You're indeed done with stealth?

9140
07:53:14,460 --> 07:53:19,440
Oh my gosh.

9141
07:53:21,140 --> 07:53:22,980
It feels so good.

9142
07:53:23,280 --> 07:53:24,840
It feels so good.

9143
07:53:25,720 --> 07:53:26,360
Yes!

9144
07:53:26,360 --> 07:53:27,820
It feels so good.

9145
07:53:31,960 --> 07:53:32,480
Yabba dabba doo.

9146
07:53:33,460 --> 07:53:35,800
I can see why he says yabba dabba doo now.

9147
07:53:37,080 --> 07:53:39,160
There's just some moments when you want to say it.

9148
07:53:39,740 --> 07:53:40,640
You know what I mean?

9149
07:53:41,680 --> 07:53:42,640
She doesn't know.

9150
07:53:43,000 --> 07:53:43,400
Stop.

9151
07:53:49,020 --> 07:53:50,780
Now it's stealth chapter two.

9152
07:53:51,940 --> 07:53:52,340
Oh.

9153
07:53:57,540 --> 07:53:58,400
I can't tell.

9154
07:53:58,560 --> 07:53:59,260
Some of you guys...

9155
07:53:59,260 --> 07:54:01,320
I can't tell if some of you guys are trolling or...

9156
07:54:02,040 --> 07:54:04,280
I'm just gonna always assume that you guys are trolling.

9157
07:54:05,160 --> 07:54:05,600
Okay.

9158
07:54:10,930 --> 07:54:12,210
This one we can get...

9159
07:54:13,490 --> 07:54:17,790
We can get through to the bolts pretty easily so...

9160
07:54:20,010 --> 07:54:20,750
Good assumption.

9161
07:54:24,470 --> 07:54:24,910
Troll?

9162
07:54:25,670 --> 07:54:26,110
Awesome!

9163
07:54:27,070 --> 07:54:27,690
You're right.

9164
07:54:27,810 --> 07:54:28,750
You guys would never do that.

9165
07:54:28,910 --> 07:54:29,970
I trust you guys...

9166
07:54:29,970 --> 07:54:32,010
I think I trust you guys way too much actually.

9167
07:54:33,250 --> 07:54:34,910
And I never learned my lesson.

9168
07:54:35,410 --> 07:54:38,110
I trust you guys and I never learned my lesson not to.

9169
07:54:38,330 --> 07:54:38,410
So...

9170
07:54:41,050 --> 07:54:44,030
I just want to believe that you guys have the best interest.

9171
07:54:58,390 --> 07:54:59,850
We do but it's funny.

9172
07:55:01,150 --> 07:55:02,090
You're so...

9173
07:55:02,090 --> 07:55:03,290
You guys are so evil.

9174
07:55:06,940 --> 07:55:14,020
This thing is so much like the little pod or the little thingy in Death Stranding.

9175
07:55:21,650 --> 07:55:22,490
Boat time.

9176
07:55:22,490 --> 07:55:22,570
Ball time.

9177
07:55:25,610 --> 07:55:26,010
Oh!

9178
07:55:28,550 --> 07:55:29,390
Okay here we go.

9179
07:55:30,550 --> 07:55:30,950
Here

9180
07:55:34,240 --> 07:55:34,420
we go.

9181
07:55:34,800 --> 07:55:35,880
Ooh they're back!

9182
07:55:36,040 --> 07:55:38,120
Oh my gosh, for some reason...

9183
07:55:39,120 --> 07:55:40,420
Yes, they would be back.

9184
07:55:40,460 --> 07:55:40,920
It's a loop.

9185
07:55:41,000 --> 07:55:42,320
But my brain is just like...

9186
07:55:42,320 --> 07:55:43,160
Oh my god they're back.

9187
07:55:43,660 --> 07:55:44,060
Mia!

9188
07:55:45,020 --> 07:55:45,420
Scary!

9189
07:55:47,700 --> 07:55:49,080
No, no, nice ball.

9190
07:55:49,340 --> 07:55:50,220
No, no, nice ball.

9191
07:55:50,540 --> 07:55:52,160
Okay so I have to put this down right?

9192
07:55:58,760 --> 07:55:59,940
And in the dark...

9193
07:55:59,940 --> 07:56:00,100
Scary.

9194
07:56:00,100 --> 07:56:00,340
Goodness.

9195
07:56:01,080 --> 07:56:01,760
We vanish.

9196
07:56:03,660 --> 07:56:05,320
Time to break the game, exactly.

9197
07:56:06,840 --> 07:56:08,740
Wait, do I need to extinguish these or...

9198
07:56:09,720 --> 07:56:10,860
No, I'm just gonna leave.

9199
07:56:11,040 --> 07:56:11,280
Bye!

9200
07:56:27,800 --> 07:56:29,420
We're just a figment of your imagination.

9201
07:56:31,260 --> 07:56:32,900
Wait, I have to have the lamp?

9202
07:56:34,560 --> 07:56:38,720
I'll be honest, I thought in the thing it showed him putting it down.

9203
07:56:47,200 --> 07:56:48,280
I'll take the lamp.

9204
07:56:51,800 --> 07:56:52,700
Take the lamp.

9205
07:56:58,690 --> 07:56:59,930
That was cool though.

9206
07:57:01,830 --> 07:57:02,390
Wait,

9207
07:57:07,400 --> 07:57:09,460
so it's not supposed to look like that.

9208
07:57:15,940 --> 07:57:17,780
Now I'm scared even more.

9209
07:57:18,340 --> 07:57:22,220
Wait, so I'm gonna actually extinguish these.

9210
07:57:26,740 --> 07:57:27,280
Oh!

9211
07:57:31,720 --> 07:57:32,640
Now I know.

9212
07:57:35,580 --> 07:57:36,120
Okay.

9213
07:57:36,220 --> 07:57:37,720
Third time's the charm, everybody.

9214
07:57:38,380 --> 07:57:39,700
Third time's the charm.

9215
07:57:42,880 --> 07:57:44,500
Third time's the charm, everybody.

9216
07:57:46,880 --> 07:57:47,800
Knowledge gained.

9217
07:57:49,880 --> 07:57:51,100
Now we know what happens.

9218
07:57:52,140 --> 07:57:55,560
Curiosity will get the best of us no longer.

9219
07:57:58,780 --> 07:58:01,300
The boats are afraid of the dark, okay?

9220
07:58:01,760 --> 07:58:02,600
Please understand.

9221
07:58:02,940 --> 07:58:05,540
Oh, I think we just lost that power.

9222
07:58:09,320 --> 07:58:09,760
Which...

9223
07:58:11,340 --> 07:58:12,500
Will that have any...

9224
07:58:12,500 --> 07:58:14,500
Or, not lost the power, but like...

9225
07:58:15,000 --> 07:58:17,740
Will that have anything to do with...

9226
07:58:17,740 --> 07:58:19,260
Hmm, I don't know.

9227
07:58:19,400 --> 07:58:20,180
I don't know.

9228
07:58:20,460 --> 07:58:20,980
We'll see.

9229
07:58:23,420 --> 07:58:24,300
Okay, here we go.

9230
07:58:25,660 --> 07:58:26,380
Here we go.

9231
07:58:45,120 --> 07:58:45,480
Oh!

9232
07:58:48,760 --> 07:58:49,240
Oh!

9233
07:58:51,360 --> 07:58:51,840
Oh!

9234
07:58:56,020 --> 07:58:56,500
Oh!

9235
07:59:00,200 --> 07:59:01,740
I'm just gonna go here first.

9236
07:59:02,740 --> 07:59:04,600
We can actually walk around in the water!

9237
07:59:10,950 --> 07:59:11,430
Oh!

9238
07:59:12,630 --> 07:59:14,870
Wait, can I walk in that too?

9239
07:59:15,330 --> 07:59:19,050
I extinguished those candles for the first time in one of the caves and legit thought the game bugged.

9240
07:59:19,070 --> 07:59:19,470
Haha!

9241
07:59:19,470 --> 07:59:21,010
I guess I was sort of right.

9242
07:59:21,130 --> 07:59:21,590
Yeah, right!

9243
07:59:22,570 --> 07:59:23,090
Uh...

9244
07:59:23,670 --> 07:59:24,550
Can I...

9245
07:59:24,550 --> 07:59:25,730
Jump in here?

9246
07:59:26,970 --> 07:59:28,090
I guess I'll try.

9247
07:59:29,430 --> 07:59:29,950
Okay.

9248
07:59:30,270 --> 07:59:30,930
Now I know.

9249
07:59:31,270 --> 07:59:32,150
God damn it.

9250
07:59:32,290 --> 07:59:32,790
No!

9251
07:59:33,530 --> 07:59:34,050
Hahaha...

9252
07:59:36,070 --> 07:59:37,170
Now I know!

9253
07:59:38,110 --> 07:59:39,510
Fourth time's the charm!

9254
07:59:46,320 --> 07:59:48,480
I like going from this area though.

9255
07:59:48,640 --> 07:59:51,600
Well, actually, it's gonna be a little inconvenient once the...

9256
07:59:51,600 --> 07:59:53,220
Once the dam breaks.

9257
07:59:53,220 --> 07:59:53,320
Now we're gonna have to...

9258
07:59:53,320 --> 07:59:54,080
Now that I think about it.

9259
07:59:54,360 --> 07:59:56,120
Maybe we should start doing this from the tower.

9260
07:59:58,240 --> 08:00:00,420
But this one is just so easy to get to, you know?

9261
08:00:01,720 --> 08:00:03,460
I guess the tower one's pretty easy too.

9262
08:00:04,560 --> 08:00:04,900
Hmm.

9263
08:00:06,360 --> 08:00:08,400
We'll just keep going until we have to go to the tower.

9264
08:00:11,740 --> 08:00:13,080
Definitely we learned a lot today.

9265
08:00:13,300 --> 08:00:13,840
Oh yes.

9266
08:00:14,260 --> 08:00:15,420
And we will continue learning.

9267
08:00:16,900 --> 08:00:17,960
Until it is done.

9268
08:00:18,440 --> 08:00:19,260
All right, keep going.

9269
08:00:19,400 --> 08:00:19,700
Go!

9270
08:00:20,600 --> 08:00:21,000
Go!

9271
08:00:21,580 --> 08:00:21,980
Go!

9272
08:00:21,980 --> 08:00:22,280
Go!

9273
08:00:22,280 --> 08:00:22,620
Go!

9274
08:00:31,480 --> 08:00:31,860
Go!

9275
08:00:31,860 --> 08:00:32,820
Oh, the gorge is the fastest.

9276
08:00:33,080 --> 08:00:34,340
Oh yeah, we can go there too, right?

9277
08:00:38,120 --> 08:00:38,540
Weeeew.

9278
08:00:43,340 --> 08:00:47,740
Oh, I was gonna say it's different.

9279
08:00:47,900 --> 08:00:48,360
No, it's not.

9280
08:00:48,480 --> 08:00:48,980
It's the same.

9281
08:00:50,300 --> 08:00:50,920
Let's see.

9282
08:00:52,500 --> 08:00:53,580
What's this direction?

9283
08:00:55,900 --> 08:00:56,320
Ooooh!

9284
08:00:58,180 --> 08:00:58,600
Oooh!

9285
08:00:59,020 --> 08:01:00,020
We can actually get here!

9286
08:01:01,000 --> 08:01:01,420
Oooh!

9287
08:01:01,760 --> 08:01:01,840
Oooh!

9288
08:01:03,620 --> 08:01:04,100
Wait!

9289
08:01:04,240 --> 08:01:05,060
Am I on the other side?

9290
08:01:07,320 --> 08:01:07,800
Wait.

9291
08:01:10,260 --> 08:01:11,800
We've been here before!

9292
08:01:15,780 --> 08:01:17,300
This is that place?

9293
08:01:18,080 --> 08:01:20,280
Okay, what place have we not been to before, then?

9294
08:01:23,940 --> 08:01:24,580
Let's see.

9295
08:01:33,380 --> 08:01:35,540
Now I know how to get past.

9296
08:01:36,240 --> 08:01:36,720
Okay.

9297
08:01:36,740 --> 08:01:36,940
Let's see.

9298
08:01:36,960 --> 08:01:37,040
Oh, this is the end.

9299
08:01:43,440 --> 08:01:44,080
Oh!

9300
08:01:46,760 --> 08:01:47,400
Nice!

9301
08:01:49,340 --> 08:01:49,980
Wait.

9302
08:01:50,260 --> 08:01:51,820
Wait, what is this actually?

9303
08:01:52,060 --> 08:01:52,480
Huh?

9304
08:01:52,820 --> 08:01:53,780
What is that?

9305
08:01:53,900 --> 08:01:54,400
Never mind.

9306
08:01:54,500 --> 08:01:55,320
I thought it was something else.

9307
08:02:11,470 --> 08:02:12,110
Oh!

9308
08:02:12,630 --> 08:02:16,950
These are extinguishing the...

9309
08:02:16,950 --> 08:02:18,190
Oh!

9310
08:02:27,000 --> 08:02:28,080
The locks!

9311
08:02:30,020 --> 08:02:30,660
Ahhh!

9312
08:02:31,160 --> 08:02:31,800
Okay.

9313
08:02:32,740 --> 08:02:33,900
So we got that one.

9314
08:02:36,820 --> 08:02:38,960
Wait, can I just walk on this or no?

9315
08:02:39,540 --> 08:02:41,740
I can't tell what's real water and what's not anymore.

9316
08:02:42,720 --> 08:02:43,780
Hashtag free Mutara.

9317
08:02:47,120 --> 08:02:49,960
Yeah, the combinations are gone, but we can still...

9318
08:02:49,960 --> 08:02:51,580
Okay, I'm just gonna try walking on it.

9319
08:02:52,000 --> 08:02:53,040
This is real water.

9320
08:02:53,180 --> 08:02:53,700
Okay, okay, okay.

9321
08:02:53,800 --> 08:02:55,720
How can you tell what's real and what's fake?

9322
08:03:00,340 --> 08:03:00,780
Yeah!

9323
08:03:00,780 --> 08:03:02,060
Uh-oh, I think I'm stuck here.

9324
08:03:05,100 --> 08:03:07,580
So we do... oh wait, no, wait.

9325
08:03:14,160 --> 08:03:15,820
So we do...

9326
08:03:20,660 --> 08:03:21,320
Skill issue?

9327
08:03:21,520 --> 08:03:22,620
Okay, there we go.

9328
08:03:26,440 --> 08:03:26,880
Okay.

9329
08:03:28,900 --> 08:03:31,060
I can't get over to that one...

9330
08:03:31,920 --> 08:03:32,980
quite yet.

9331
08:03:35,000 --> 08:03:36,560
Hmm, okay.

9332
08:03:37,980 --> 08:03:41,760
So now it's a matter of figuring out how to blow them out.

9333
08:03:47,920 --> 08:03:49,020
Let's try over here.

9334
08:03:49,100 --> 08:03:50,100
What's going on?

9335
08:03:50,900 --> 08:03:52,340
There's even smoke here.

9336
08:03:54,260 --> 08:03:56,740
This place looks like it's on fire fire.

9337
08:03:59,940 --> 08:04:01,620
You have everything now.

9338
08:04:02,400 --> 08:04:03,360
Wait, actually?

9339
08:04:05,180 --> 08:04:06,120
Oh man.

9340
08:04:09,220 --> 08:04:10,640
Wait, there's a rock up there?

9341
08:04:10,780 --> 08:04:11,180
No way.

9342
08:04:19,110 --> 08:04:20,830
We're about to get a rude awakening.

9343
08:04:25,430 --> 08:04:26,870
Probably have an hour or two left.

9344
08:04:26,990 --> 08:04:27,550
Okay, perfect!

9345
08:04:27,890 --> 08:04:28,370
Awesome.

9346
08:04:30,510 --> 08:04:31,210
There we go.

9347
08:04:36,030 --> 08:04:38,350
This way.

9348
08:04:39,130 --> 08:04:40,190
Up's a daisy.

9349
08:04:41,270 --> 08:04:42,010
Okay.

9350
08:04:42,330 --> 08:04:43,590
The puzzle pieces.

9351
08:04:43,770 --> 08:04:45,590
We have every puzzle piece!

9352
08:04:46,250 --> 08:04:50,130
Now we just have to be big brained.

9353
08:04:56,440 --> 08:04:57,020
Hmm.

9354
08:05:01,300 --> 08:05:01,900
No.

9355
08:05:06,700 --> 08:05:07,280
Hmm.

9356
08:05:08,120 --> 08:05:09,300
But also...

9357
08:05:11,980 --> 08:05:13,840
I still don't know what that thing is.

9358
08:05:13,980 --> 08:05:14,980
The thing that's been...

9359
08:05:16,660 --> 08:05:17,680
That's been going...

9360
08:05:23,680 --> 08:05:26,180
I don't feel like I'm very close at all.

9361
08:05:34,960 --> 08:05:35,400
Unless...

9362
08:05:38,440 --> 08:05:41,240
Is it a thing that, like, activates...

9363
08:05:42,600 --> 08:05:43,600
Like, the movement?

9364
08:05:43,940 --> 08:05:45,620
Because I'm still convinced that we're moving.

9365
08:05:45,800 --> 08:05:46,960
Like, away from the sun.

9366
08:05:46,960 --> 08:05:51,940
Is it a thing that activates and starts moving us away?

9367
08:05:52,100 --> 08:05:52,540
I wonder?

9368
08:05:54,840 --> 08:05:55,280
Or...

9369
08:05:56,280 --> 08:05:57,280
Something like that?

9370
08:05:58,480 --> 08:05:59,520
Look at the map.

9371
08:06:00,420 --> 08:06:01,560
Wait, how do I look at the map?

9372
08:06:02,400 --> 08:06:03,240
Yeah, I can't.

9373
08:06:03,260 --> 08:06:03,920
I have no map.

9374
08:06:06,960 --> 08:06:08,980
Where do you enter the stranger?

9375
08:06:09,200 --> 08:06:10,620
Why don't you die to Supernova?

9376
08:06:11,620 --> 08:06:12,560
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

9377
08:06:12,600 --> 08:06:13,660
Since we're far, far away.

9378
08:06:22,850 --> 08:06:24,050
So I am kind of right.

9379
08:06:26,330 --> 08:06:28,030
But it's us getting the heck out of here.

9380
08:06:33,260 --> 08:06:35,100
I like going through this one because...

9381
08:06:37,000 --> 08:06:37,720
Rather than...

9382
08:06:37,720 --> 08:06:39,700
Like, I like doing here because...

9383
08:06:41,880 --> 08:06:43,580
The tower, we know how much...

9384
08:06:43,580 --> 08:06:45,700
Like, once the tower tips, we know how much time we have left.

9385
08:06:45,800 --> 08:06:46,200
You know what I mean?

9386
08:06:46,340 --> 08:06:46,860
So it's...

9387
08:06:46,860 --> 08:06:48,300
I think it's a better gauge.

9388
08:06:49,880 --> 08:06:51,960
It's a better gauge of...

9389
08:06:51,960 --> 08:06:52,340
Uh...

9390
08:06:54,380 --> 08:06:55,380
Time for me.

9391
08:07:03,230 --> 08:07:05,110
Flavor plus assistance with the timing.

9392
08:07:05,290 --> 08:07:08,890
Plus you found the log that literally said Stranger Tic-Tac's Supernova and balls out.

9393
08:07:09,010 --> 08:07:09,750
Yeah, okay.

9394
08:07:09,830 --> 08:07:10,570
So I am...

9395
08:07:10,570 --> 08:07:11,790
I am on, like...

9396
08:07:11,790 --> 08:07:14,530
In the right mindset of that then.

9397
08:07:14,690 --> 08:07:15,710
Okay, that makes sense.

9398
08:07:16,730 --> 08:07:20,250
I was wondering if it was like something powering on or powering off.

9399
08:07:21,730 --> 08:07:22,690
Powering on...

9400
08:07:24,090 --> 08:07:25,030
Does make sense.

9401
08:07:27,810 --> 08:07:28,350
Okie dokie.

9402
08:07:31,050 --> 08:07:32,330
I don't think that's a spoiler.

9403
08:07:34,230 --> 08:07:35,070
I don't think so.

9404
08:07:38,770 --> 08:07:41,950
There's a diagram in the damn room that you found that shows it moving away.

9405
08:07:42,170 --> 08:07:42,670
Yep, yep, yep.

9406
08:07:42,950 --> 08:07:44,310
I did... I did see that.

9407
08:07:47,230 --> 08:07:49,970
But unless you like spend six minutes there, you don't see it update.

9408
08:07:50,130 --> 08:07:50,890
Oh, okay, okay.

9409
08:07:51,270 --> 08:07:52,070
Alright, here we go.

9410
08:07:57,000 --> 08:07:57,360
Whee!

9411
08:08:01,980 --> 08:08:02,920
So cool.

9412
08:08:04,660 --> 08:08:05,140
Okay.

9413
08:08:17,920 --> 08:08:19,860
It didn't light back up, did it?

9414
08:08:22,380 --> 08:08:23,620
The lock, I mean.

9415
08:08:25,480 --> 08:08:26,580
Oh no, I think it's...

9416
08:08:26,580 --> 08:08:27,340
I think it's...

9417
08:08:28,440 --> 08:08:29,400
This one.

9418
08:08:31,260 --> 08:08:33,480
This one that should be here, right?

9419
08:08:33,600 --> 08:08:33,860
Yeah.

9420
08:08:34,500 --> 08:08:35,400
That went out.

9421
08:08:39,150 --> 08:08:41,970
Maybe we don't even need to come here.

9422
08:08:43,690 --> 08:08:44,050
Maybe.

9423
08:08:44,910 --> 08:08:46,430
Actually, since I sent the boat...

9424
08:08:52,050 --> 08:08:53,970
Maybe I didn't need to go to the glitch zone.

9425
08:08:58,230 --> 08:08:58,790
Hold on.

9426
08:08:59,030 --> 08:08:59,970
I'm still looking around.

9427
08:09:01,850 --> 08:09:02,930
Boat is still on land side?

9428
08:09:04,070 --> 08:09:04,990
On my side?

9429
08:09:05,530 --> 08:09:06,210
Or over there?

9430
08:09:06,990 --> 08:09:07,930
Oh no, there's the boat.

9431
08:09:08,010 --> 08:09:08,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

9432
08:09:09,430 --> 08:09:11,270
Once I send the boat...

9433
08:09:12,050 --> 08:09:12,410
What?

9434
08:09:12,490 --> 08:09:14,790
It will just take me back and forth still, right?

9435
08:09:15,430 --> 08:09:15,790
So...

9436
08:09:17,090 --> 08:09:17,570
Hmm...

9437
08:09:42,200 --> 08:09:44,560
I never figured out a thing for this.

9438
08:09:46,920 --> 08:09:47,640
Did I?

9439
08:09:49,400 --> 08:09:50,260
I don't think...

9440
08:09:50,260 --> 08:09:51,280
No, I don't think I ever...

9441
08:09:51,280 --> 08:09:52,220
There never was.

9442
08:09:53,400 --> 08:09:55,320
Because we never were able to figure them out.

9443
08:09:58,420 --> 08:09:58,900
So...

9444
08:09:58,900 --> 08:10:00,760
What if I brute forced it?

9445
08:10:00,760 --> 08:10:00,880
What if I...

9446
08:10:29,660 --> 08:10:30,100
Oh.

9447
08:10:30,500 --> 08:10:31,160
Ha ha ha.

9448
08:10:31,640 --> 08:10:33,160
Started going on and off again.

9449
08:10:40,860 --> 08:10:42,300
Weren't there platforms here?

9450
08:10:42,520 --> 08:10:43,260
Or am I crazy?

9451
08:10:49,660 --> 08:10:50,880
I want to see the glitch world.

9452
08:10:50,940 --> 08:10:51,520
Yeah, that's what I'm...

9453
08:10:51,520 --> 08:10:53,700
Literally, that's exactly what I was just saying.

9454
08:10:55,120 --> 08:10:55,640
Let's see.

9455
08:10:55,700 --> 08:10:56,360
Put it down.

9456
08:10:57,240 --> 08:10:58,300
Go down here.

9457
08:10:59,380 --> 08:10:59,820
Oh.

9458
08:11:02,200 --> 08:11:02,860
Glitch world.

9459
08:11:05,280 --> 08:11:06,160
Can I just...

9460
08:11:06,160 --> 08:11:07,540
And there are platforms here.

9461
08:11:13,440 --> 08:11:14,360
Wait.

9462
08:11:15,180 --> 08:11:16,260
Wait a second.

9463
08:11:19,140 --> 08:11:21,400
What the heck?

9464
08:11:21,920 --> 08:11:23,180
I'm a secret genius.

9465
08:11:25,800 --> 08:11:27,000
I'm a secret genius.

9466
08:11:49,220 --> 08:11:50,960
Oh my god.

9467
08:11:51,140 --> 08:11:52,460
That's so funny.

9468
08:11:54,560 --> 08:11:55,200
It's

9469
08:12:00,030 --> 08:12:00,670
impeccable.

9470
08:12:04,570 --> 08:12:06,910
A genius taken before her time.

9471
08:12:09,870 --> 08:12:13,530
But now we know we can just go to the bell.

9472
08:12:13,850 --> 08:12:16,190
We don't have to go to the glitch world.

9473
08:12:19,530 --> 08:12:20,910
At least I don't think so.

9474
08:12:21,790 --> 08:12:21,910
You know what?

9475
08:12:21,970 --> 08:12:24,650
I'm gonna go to the back rooms.

9476
08:12:26,430 --> 08:12:28,990
Actually, I will go to the back rooms just in case we need that boat back.

9477
08:12:30,470 --> 08:12:30,830
Okay.

9478
08:12:31,590 --> 08:12:32,190
Oh yeah.

9479
08:12:32,290 --> 08:12:33,610
We're gonna have to unlock it again.

9480
08:12:33,650 --> 08:12:34,070
That's so true.

9481
08:12:34,290 --> 08:12:34,770
Never mind.

9482
08:12:35,570 --> 08:12:35,930
Yeah.

9483
08:12:35,950 --> 08:12:36,690
We're gonna have to unlock it.

9484
08:12:37,550 --> 08:12:38,950
Let's see what the ship logs say now.

9485
08:12:40,410 --> 08:12:41,130
Hey log...

9486
08:12:42,310 --> 08:12:42,670
Nothing.

9487
08:12:45,110 --> 08:12:45,650
Oh wait.

9488
08:12:48,090 --> 08:12:49,090
This one updated.

9489
08:12:51,790 --> 08:12:54,850
There's a container marked with the vault seal but its contents have been destroyed.

9490
08:12:56,090 --> 08:12:59,110
Intact slide reveals the sacrifice that was made to build the stranger.

9491
08:12:59,330 --> 08:13:01,830
I found a slide rail that appears to be some sort of error report.

9492
08:13:02,010 --> 08:13:07,170
It shows one of the stranger's inhabitants jumping off a raft during a transition between areas and falling below the world.

9493
08:13:09,750 --> 08:13:10,550
Very cool.

9494
08:13:13,590 --> 08:13:14,010
Okay.

9495
08:13:15,150 --> 08:13:16,370
Not the back rooms.

9496
08:13:16,630 --> 08:13:17,930
Yes, that is the back rooms.

9497
08:13:20,110 --> 08:13:21,970
That's the... that's literally the back rooms.

9498
08:13:23,430 --> 08:13:26,170
That's the... everybody raise your hand if you think that's the back rooms.

9499
08:13:45,220 --> 08:13:46,100
I'm in.

9500
08:13:46,800 --> 08:13:47,540
Hacker voice.

9501
08:13:47,940 --> 08:13:48,500
I'm in.

9502
08:13:52,020 --> 08:13:53,900
Guys, did I cook or did I...

9503
08:13:54,860 --> 08:13:58,060
Did I cook with that... that... that answer?

9504
08:14:00,160 --> 08:14:01,700
Did I cook or did I cook?

9505
08:14:06,760 --> 08:14:07,920
Great landing as always.

9506
08:14:07,960 --> 08:14:08,460
Thank you.

9507
08:14:10,140 --> 08:14:11,180
Keep cooking.

9508
08:14:11,940 --> 08:14:12,880
It's not over yet?

9509
08:14:13,140 --> 08:14:13,360
Okay.

9510
08:14:13,720 --> 08:14:15,740
So I must still continue to cook?

9511
08:14:16,160 --> 08:14:16,680
Okay.

9512
08:14:20,010 --> 08:14:20,530
Wait.

9513
08:14:25,330 --> 08:14:26,430
I'm trying to decide.

9514
08:14:27,310 --> 08:14:28,370
Oh, well...

9515
08:14:30,250 --> 08:14:33,630
I'm just going to grab the artifact here and then we'll go back to the tower.

9516
08:14:37,890 --> 08:14:38,470
Nice.

9517
08:14:42,130 --> 08:14:43,930
The final cook down.

9518
08:14:44,850 --> 08:14:47,610
It's the final cook down.

9519
08:14:49,250 --> 08:14:50,870
It isn't raw.

9520
08:14:51,610 --> 08:14:53,150
But it's not well done.

9521
08:14:53,710 --> 08:14:55,110
It's a perfect cook.

9522
08:15:01,290 --> 08:15:02,410
Needs more egg.

9523
08:15:03,370 --> 08:15:05,170
Honestly, that's me with like everything.

9524
08:15:07,990 --> 08:15:09,050
Egg sometimes...

9525
08:15:09,050 --> 08:15:09,290
Wow.

9526
08:15:09,530 --> 08:15:13,470
Egg sometimes gives me like a migraine but I love egg.

9527
08:15:13,690 --> 08:15:14,530
I love it.

9528
08:15:15,330 --> 08:15:16,390
I love egg.

9529
08:15:16,470 --> 08:15:17,590
I feel like everything could use up.

9530
08:15:19,850 --> 08:15:21,250
Egg is just perfect for everything.

9531
08:15:21,450 --> 08:15:21,850
Egg soup.

9532
08:15:23,610 --> 08:15:24,590
Egg and ramen.

9533
08:15:25,590 --> 08:15:26,550
Egg sando.

9534
08:15:28,070 --> 08:15:28,470
Omelette.

9535
08:15:28,710 --> 08:15:30,150
I mean, I have to love an omelette.

9536
08:15:30,210 --> 08:15:30,730
I'm a maid.

9537
08:15:36,660 --> 08:15:40,340
That's why, you know, when Matara makes fun of me for liking tamago sushi...

9538
08:15:42,440 --> 08:15:45,020
It's just, you know, it's because I just like egg.

9539
08:15:45,060 --> 08:15:48,220
And then they sweeten the egg a little bit and it's so yummy.

9540
08:15:48,940 --> 08:15:52,240
Oh, I wish I could get some sushi.

9541
08:15:58,190 --> 08:16:00,570
Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.

9542
08:16:01,010 --> 08:16:02,290
Thank you, Senator.

9543
08:16:05,650 --> 08:16:08,070
Wait, does he say it or does the other guy?

9544
08:16:08,230 --> 08:16:08,770
I can't remember.

9545
08:16:09,350 --> 08:16:10,670
Oh gosh, I gotta replay.

9546
08:16:11,030 --> 08:16:12,310
You know what's so exciting?

9547
08:16:12,910 --> 08:16:19,930
Whenever I play Metal Gear Rising again, it'll be my first time replaying it after having...

9548
08:16:22,750 --> 08:16:24,630
Like, played through the game.

9549
08:16:24,810 --> 08:16:28,610
So things are going to... I'm gonna get so much more of the references and stuff.

9550
08:16:29,810 --> 08:16:30,750
So excited.

9551
08:16:31,910 --> 08:16:33,450
Yeah, I'll get all the references.

9552
08:16:36,090 --> 08:16:38,450
We're making a mother of all omelettes here, Jack.

9553
08:16:45,400 --> 08:16:46,320
Into the void.

9554
08:16:46,920 --> 08:16:48,240
Into the unknown.

9555
08:16:50,880 --> 08:16:52,320
Into the unknown.

9556
08:16:52,980 --> 08:16:54,260
Well, I don't know.

9557
08:16:54,320 --> 08:16:56,940
I have no idea what I'm going to be singing at all tomorrow, you guys.

9558
08:16:57,160 --> 08:16:58,320
I might just like...

9559
08:16:59,660 --> 08:17:04,480
I was going to be like, I'm singing whatever I want because singing, you know...

9560
08:17:05,340 --> 08:17:06,700
You know, I'm not sorry.

9561
08:17:08,180 --> 08:17:09,620
Sorry, I'm not the best singer.

9562
08:17:11,340 --> 08:17:13,460
But singing makes me feel good.

9563
08:17:14,500 --> 08:17:16,100
And it's been a rough week for me.

9564
08:17:17,440 --> 08:17:18,660
Even though it's only Tuesday.

9565
08:17:20,780 --> 08:17:22,640
So I just was like, you know what?

9566
08:17:22,680 --> 08:17:23,700
I'm just going to do a karaoke.

9567
08:17:24,060 --> 08:17:25,400
To let it all out.

9568
08:17:38,450 --> 08:17:39,330
Yeah, Bucket.

9569
08:17:39,330 --> 08:17:39,690
We ball.

9570
08:17:40,090 --> 08:17:40,530
Exactly.

9571
08:17:43,490 --> 08:17:46,490
I... I'm not one to like...

9572
08:17:46,990 --> 08:17:50,970
You know, when I hear really amazing singers, you know, I mean...

9573
08:17:50,970 --> 08:17:52,050
Like I'm...

9574
08:17:53,030 --> 08:17:54,250
Please stop pat patting.

9575
08:17:54,290 --> 08:17:55,630
What are my absolute favorite people to watch?

9576
08:17:55,890 --> 08:17:56,330
Stop!

9577
08:17:57,250 --> 08:17:58,690
It's like, you know, I'm...

9578
08:17:58,690 --> 08:17:59,530
There's like...

9579
08:18:00,890 --> 08:18:02,170
Like, you know...

9580
08:18:02,690 --> 08:18:04,990
There's always going to be someone better than you, you know?

9581
08:18:05,070 --> 08:18:05,490
Or like...

9582
08:18:05,490 --> 08:18:07,550
Based on people's opinions or whatever.

9583
08:18:07,870 --> 08:18:08,950
Oh, hold on.

9584
08:18:09,390 --> 08:18:09,890
There we go.

9585
08:18:10,430 --> 08:18:12,690
I'm not one to be like...

9586
08:18:14,070 --> 08:18:14,990
How do I say?

9587
08:18:15,570 --> 08:18:16,170
Like...

9588
08:18:16,490 --> 08:18:18,590
Like when I hear such amazing...

9589
08:18:19,470 --> 08:18:20,330
Vtuber singers.

9590
08:18:21,090 --> 08:18:22,030
Like Elizabeth.

9591
08:18:23,230 --> 08:18:24,910
Like, I'm not like...

9592
08:18:24,910 --> 08:18:25,410
Oh, man.

9593
08:18:26,350 --> 08:18:27,450
I feel so...

9594
08:18:27,450 --> 08:18:28,370
Like it doesn't...

9595
08:18:28,370 --> 08:18:28,890
It's not...

9596
08:18:28,890 --> 08:18:31,950
It's not something that like makes me want to put myself down or anything.

9597
08:18:32,370 --> 08:18:33,090
Like I...

9598
08:18:34,270 --> 08:18:38,470
Think people having so much talent is like so amazing.

9599
08:18:38,850 --> 08:18:43,170
I bring her up because I've been watching her karaoke stream so much.

9600
08:18:44,370 --> 08:18:45,870
And I know other people are too.

9601
08:18:46,610 --> 08:18:47,250
Oh, wait.

9602
08:18:47,330 --> 08:18:48,290
We got to go to the other side.

9603
08:18:51,250 --> 08:18:52,590
But, you know...

9604
08:18:53,230 --> 08:18:54,730
I do think like...

9605
08:18:57,450 --> 08:18:59,530
It makes me want to improve if I can.

9606
08:19:01,810 --> 08:19:02,710
In that way.

9607
08:19:07,190 --> 08:19:08,110
I think it's...

9608
08:19:08,110 --> 08:19:09,590
I think it's really fun when...

9609
08:19:10,310 --> 08:19:10,870
Oh, wait.

9610
08:19:10,910 --> 08:19:12,550
Let's go put our little guy away.

9611
08:19:12,810 --> 08:19:14,590
I think it's fun, you know...

9612
08:19:14,590 --> 08:19:17,930
When people have, you know, different...

9613
08:19:18,950 --> 08:19:19,670
What's the word?

9614
08:19:23,770 --> 08:19:24,650
When like...

9615
08:19:24,650 --> 08:19:25,110
Oh, my gosh.

9616
08:19:25,270 --> 08:19:26,050
I can't see anything.

9617
08:19:27,030 --> 08:19:27,870
How do I say it?

9618
08:19:27,990 --> 08:19:29,570
If everybody had the same talent...

9619
08:19:29,570 --> 08:19:30,730
It would be so boring.

9620
08:19:30,910 --> 08:19:31,750
Is what I'm trying to say.

9621
08:19:33,010 --> 08:19:33,590
You know?

9622
08:19:34,310 --> 08:19:36,630
If everybody had the same talent...

9623
08:19:36,630 --> 08:19:37,210
It would be like...

9624
08:19:37,210 --> 08:19:38,750
Oh, everybody can sing.

9625
08:19:40,390 --> 08:19:41,030
There we go.

9626
08:19:41,610 --> 08:19:42,570
Oh, there we go.

9627
08:19:43,250 --> 08:19:43,890
There we go.

9628
08:19:45,110 --> 08:19:45,470
So...

9629
08:19:45,470 --> 08:19:46,450
You know...

9630
08:19:47,270 --> 08:19:48,810
Even if I'm not the best singer...

9631
08:19:48,810 --> 08:19:49,950
I maybe still have other stuff.

9632
08:19:50,030 --> 08:19:50,550
So, it's okay.

9633
08:19:55,610 --> 08:19:56,750
Wait, can I do it from here?

9634
08:19:56,870 --> 08:19:57,590
Or do I have to...

9635
08:20:02,750 --> 08:20:03,530
Oh, I can.

9636
08:20:03,750 --> 08:20:04,150
Nice.

9637
08:20:04,410 --> 08:20:05,310
Easy peasy.

9638
08:20:05,610 --> 08:20:06,170
Yeah.

9639
08:20:10,290 --> 08:20:11,830
You need your artifact?

9640
08:20:12,170 --> 08:20:13,550
No, I don't.

9641
08:20:16,810 --> 08:20:18,630
What about the last one?

9642
08:20:18,810 --> 08:20:19,430
No, this one?

9643
08:20:21,010 --> 08:20:22,250
Let's see what things do.

9644
08:20:37,400 --> 08:20:37,960
Hmm.

9645
08:20:51,220 --> 08:20:52,180
No way.

9646
08:20:52,260 --> 08:20:54,700
You thought you'll use one secret to solve two puzzles.

9647
08:20:54,860 --> 08:20:55,460
Shut up.

9648
08:20:58,340 --> 08:20:59,960
Please don't sell yourself short.

9649
08:21:01,040 --> 08:21:01,740
You know.

9650
08:21:03,480 --> 08:21:04,240
But, okay.

9651
08:21:04,340 --> 08:21:04,860
I have a question.

9652
08:21:05,260 --> 08:21:06,120
I have a question.

9653
08:21:06,240 --> 08:21:07,060
Is everything that I...

9654
08:21:07,380 --> 08:21:07,620
Like...

9655
08:21:08,300 --> 08:21:11,520
That I need to solve this in this vicinity.

9656
08:21:11,920 --> 08:21:12,580
I guess.

9657
08:21:13,800 --> 08:21:14,580
Because I think...

9658
08:21:14,580 --> 08:21:15,380
I think I saw some...

9659
08:21:15,380 --> 08:21:15,820
Oh my goodness.

9660
08:21:15,940 --> 08:21:17,080
How am I supposed to go back upstairs?

9661
08:21:17,400 --> 08:21:18,960
I saw some people say like...

9662
08:21:18,960 --> 08:21:20,600
Maybe check the logs again.

9663
08:21:21,020 --> 08:21:21,420
But...

9664
08:21:24,820 --> 08:21:26,680
I haven't looked at the logs.

9665
08:21:27,800 --> 08:21:28,200
So...

9666
08:21:28,200 --> 08:21:31,480
Will I be able to solve it if I haven't looked at the logs?

9667
08:21:36,530 --> 08:21:36,930
Hmm.

9668
08:21:45,190 --> 08:21:47,110
I have all the information to solve it.

9669
08:21:48,690 --> 08:21:49,490
It's technically...

9670
08:21:49,490 --> 08:21:49,690
No.

9671
08:21:49,850 --> 08:21:50,190
Wait.

9672
08:21:50,310 --> 08:21:50,950
What do you mean?

9673
08:21:51,250 --> 08:21:52,250
It's in the ship logs.

9674
08:21:52,850 --> 08:21:53,250
Hmm.

9675
08:21:56,850 --> 08:22:07,590
Can I go back upstairs?

9676
08:22:11,030 --> 08:22:11,810
Oh...

9677
08:22:11,810 --> 08:22:12,310
So.

9678
08:22:12,310 --> 08:22:13,250
That's the end.

9679
08:22:14,670 --> 08:22:15,390
Thanks a lot for letting me tell you.

9680
08:22:17,530 --> 08:22:17,910
That's okay.

9681
08:22:17,910 --> 08:22:18,150
You don't have to bring it.

9682
08:22:18,190 --> 08:22:18,710
Thank you.

9683
08:22:18,710 --> 08:22:19,790
It's...

9684
08:22:22,570 --> 08:22:23,270
Thank you.

9685
08:22:23,270 --> 08:22:24,170
Another...another thing.

9686
08:22:27,970 --> 08:22:28,870
Okay, hold on.

9687
08:22:28,990 --> 08:22:29,370
I'm thinking.

9688
08:22:32,810 --> 08:22:34,150
Oh, that's so funny.

9689
08:22:34,590 --> 08:22:36,270
I forgot that this one was broken.

9690
08:22:40,950 --> 08:22:42,350
Where are you going?

9691
08:22:42,770 --> 08:22:43,270
Why?

9692
08:22:46,690 --> 08:22:48,150
Why did you leave me?

9693
08:22:54,810 --> 08:22:55,330
Okay.

9694
08:22:55,330 --> 08:22:55,410
Okay.

9695
08:22:57,510 --> 08:22:59,830
Just remember what you learned from each stealth section.

9696
08:23:00,250 --> 08:23:02,310
A whole lot of nothing.

9697
08:23:06,550 --> 08:23:09,470
Unless this is a similar thing where I have to...

9698
08:23:09,470 --> 08:23:09,630
Wait.

9699
08:23:09,870 --> 08:23:11,070
So I've noticed...

9700
08:23:11,070 --> 08:23:12,630
I'm noticing this.

9701
08:23:12,950 --> 08:23:15,130
This is like the big key here.

9702
08:23:16,730 --> 08:23:17,210
The...

9703
08:23:18,350 --> 08:23:20,610
The light that is shining from the ceiling.

9704
08:23:20,770 --> 08:23:22,930
So it must be that I have to wait for something.

9705
08:23:23,790 --> 08:23:24,270
Right?

9706
08:23:24,330 --> 08:23:25,670
To cover that hole.

9707
08:23:26,110 --> 08:23:27,570
Because otherwise...

9708
08:23:30,470 --> 08:23:32,150
Otherwise there's no way I'll be able to get through.

9709
08:23:39,330 --> 08:23:39,950
Is it?

9710
08:23:40,070 --> 08:23:40,830
Oh, am I wrong?

9711
08:23:57,250 --> 08:23:57,610
Hmm...

9712
08:23:59,370 --> 08:24:00,750
I can't go back...

9713
08:24:00,750 --> 08:24:01,270
Oh man.

9714
08:24:01,390 --> 08:24:04,810
If I have to go back all the way to the ship logs, I might as well just meditate here.

9715
08:24:15,160 --> 08:24:15,520
Okay.

9716
08:24:15,620 --> 08:24:16,140
I'll go.

9717
08:24:19,540 --> 08:24:21,180
Go back to the ship logs.

9718
08:24:24,940 --> 08:24:27,720
I might be able to get back to the ship from here.

9719
08:24:29,120 --> 08:24:29,600
Maybe.

9720
08:24:31,260 --> 08:24:31,740
Maybe.

9721
08:24:38,530 --> 08:24:39,650
Is it coming?

9722
08:24:41,470 --> 08:24:41,950
Wait.

9723
08:24:42,010 --> 08:24:42,490
Is it coming?

9724
08:24:42,770 --> 08:24:43,570
Oh, there it is.

9725
08:24:43,890 --> 08:24:45,010
Just takes a second.

9726
08:24:46,050 --> 08:24:47,310
Oh my god!

9727
08:24:47,370 --> 08:24:48,730
I almost got squashed!

9728
08:24:49,330 --> 08:24:50,550
Almost got squashed!

9729
08:24:50,550 --> 08:24:50,670
Almost got squashed!

9730
08:24:53,430 --> 08:24:57,510
You just made me realize what that heavenly light is actually referencing slash communicating.

9731
08:24:58,510 --> 08:24:58,950
Oh.

9732
08:25:00,890 --> 08:25:02,450
I'm glad that I helped you with that.

9733
08:25:11,280 --> 08:25:11,720
I'm glad that I helped you with that.

9734
08:25:11,720 --> 08:25:12,580
Where are we?

9735
08:25:12,920 --> 08:25:13,360
Oh.

9736
08:25:14,340 --> 08:25:15,520
We're inside the bell.

9737
08:25:15,740 --> 08:25:16,100
That's right.

9738
08:25:16,400 --> 08:25:16,660
Oh.

9739
08:25:18,020 --> 08:25:19,580
Okay, guys.

9740
08:25:19,640 --> 08:25:20,800
I think it's just time to meditate.

9741
08:25:20,800 --> 08:25:20,880
Okay, guys.

9742
08:25:25,560 --> 08:25:27,600
At least it's easy to solve the first two.

9743
08:25:42,940 --> 08:25:57,340
You can like make, you know, you can pick fun at me, but like calling me dense I think is kind of mean after I've been streaming for eight and a half hours and, you know, I think it's a little rude to say something like that.

9744
08:25:58,980 --> 08:25:59,860
So maybe...

9745
08:26:00,380 --> 08:26:01,900
I wasn't even looking at chat.

9746
08:26:02,120 --> 08:26:03,560
I don't even know what you guys are saying.

9747
08:26:03,940 --> 08:26:05,040
So maybe...

9748
08:26:05,040 --> 08:26:07,140
I just looked over and that's the first thing I see.

9749
08:26:07,680 --> 08:26:09,500
So maybe don't be so mean.

9750
08:26:09,700 --> 08:26:10,220
You know?

9751
08:26:24,670 --> 08:26:26,890
I'm not gonna remember everything in the world.

9752
08:26:26,990 --> 08:26:27,730
So, you know.

9753
08:26:30,330 --> 08:26:31,970
There was somebody that said it.

9754
08:26:34,230 --> 08:26:39,530
It makes me, you know, I enjoy playing games like this, but like sometimes...

9755
08:26:39,530 --> 08:26:41,790
And I know that I'm like, oh please help me!

9756
08:26:42,030 --> 08:26:43,910
but it's very...

9757
08:26:43,910 --> 08:26:47,070
This is... It does make me never not want to play games like this.

9758
08:26:47,190 --> 08:26:49,570
When people immediately insult me.

9759
08:26:49,670 --> 08:26:51,030
if I don't get the...

9760
08:26:51,930 --> 08:26:53,550
If I don't get the...

9761
08:26:54,870 --> 08:26:58,050
the answer right away, so you know.

9762
08:27:00,910 --> 08:27:06,010
So I want to Okay, what am I looking through?

9763
08:27:06,410 --> 08:27:07,770
The archi- was it the archives?

9764
08:27:13,960 --> 08:27:14,860
Error report.

9765
08:27:15,020 --> 08:27:18,820
Shows an alarm bell failing to wake up strangers in habitants.

9766
08:27:21,040 --> 08:27:24,920
So I need to be dumb to not wake up the bell.

9767
08:27:36,670 --> 08:27:40,970
Alarm rea- or slide reel that appears to be some sort of error report.

9768
08:27:41,070 --> 08:27:43,830
Shows an alarm bell failing to wake up the stranger's inhabitants.

9769
08:27:52,640 --> 08:27:56,800
This one was... I know someone said about the error report, so let's see.

9770
08:27:56,840 --> 08:27:59,940
Shows one of the strangers having to be jumping off a raft during- Okay, that's the one we did.

9771
08:28:02,660 --> 08:28:03,460
Uh, wait.

9772
08:28:03,680 --> 08:28:04,800
Um, this one?

9773
08:28:08,020 --> 08:28:10,520
Shows one of the strangers having to be dropping their artifact on the ground.

9774
08:28:11,080 --> 08:28:11,480
Okay.

9775
08:28:11,880 --> 08:28:12,660
So it's this one.

9776
08:28:17,440 --> 08:28:19,500
You can scroll to see the slide reel.

9777
08:28:19,760 --> 08:28:20,640
Wait, what do you mean?

9778
08:28:22,200 --> 08:28:23,200
Oh, thank you!

9779
08:28:25,320 --> 08:28:26,400
Oh, it's only three.

9780
08:28:27,740 --> 08:28:28,220
Wait.

9781
08:28:28,420 --> 08:28:29,480
I don't think I can.

9782
08:28:29,760 --> 08:28:30,020
Wait.

9783
08:28:32,440 --> 08:28:34,620
Why is it- why does it only show three things?

9784
08:28:35,520 --> 08:28:36,540
Or- oh wait, okay.

9785
08:28:36,640 --> 08:28:37,800
Maybe it's, uh...

9786
08:28:38,840 --> 08:28:39,600
This one?

9787
08:28:40,160 --> 08:28:40,640
Yes.

9788
08:28:44,520 --> 08:28:45,040
Okay.

9789
08:28:45,920 --> 08:28:47,060
Mm-mm-mm.

9790
08:28:47,400 --> 08:28:49,000
Oh yeah, there were three reels in the place.

9791
08:28:49,080 --> 08:28:50,180
Thank you guys, thank you.

9792
08:28:50,800 --> 08:28:51,640
Thank you, thank you.

9793
08:28:52,620 --> 08:28:53,140
Okay.

9794
08:28:55,700 --> 08:28:58,840
Non-working button prompt- What are you talking about?

9795
08:28:59,120 --> 08:28:59,540
It worked!

9796
08:29:06,660 --> 08:29:08,980
If no brain activity...

9797
08:29:10,840 --> 08:29:12,540
Then, no disconnect.

9798
08:29:18,220 --> 08:29:21,440
If no brain activity, then no disconnect!

9799
08:29:24,410 --> 08:29:24,840
So...

9800
08:29:27,120 --> 08:29:29,720
I already knew that information.

9801
08:29:30,300 --> 08:29:32,500
But it's still...

9802
08:29:34,110 --> 08:29:35,860
No brain, no problem...

9803
08:29:40,680 --> 08:29:42,180
Do I have to die?

9804
08:29:42,180 --> 08:29:42,360
Why?

9805
08:30:05,910 --> 08:30:07,090
You're already deaf.

9806
08:30:09,050 --> 08:30:10,090
It's a good thing I'm not.

9807
08:30:11,990 --> 08:30:14,330
Never would hear all the good voice acting in games.

9808
08:30:19,290 --> 08:30:24,370
Okay, because we can't... if we're asleep then we obviously wake up, but it has to be that we have to be dead.

9809
08:30:25,670 --> 08:30:26,810
How do we die?

9810
08:30:32,390 --> 08:30:33,370
You are already dead.

9811
08:30:34,710 --> 08:30:36,490
Hold on, I gotta go get some...

9812
08:30:37,490 --> 08:30:39,090
My throat is really hurting real quick.

9813
08:30:39,230 --> 08:30:43,070
So give me, sorry, give me like two seconds to go grab some hot water.

9814
08:30:44,350 --> 08:30:47,370
Sorry, it like... it was hurting earlier, but I was like...

9815
08:30:47,370 --> 08:30:51,570
Since I'm just chilling here, I'm gonna go grab it real quick.

9816
08:30:51,830 --> 08:30:52,270
Real quick!

9817
08:30:52,470 --> 08:30:52,890
I'll be right back.

9818
08:30:54,010 --> 08:30:54,410
Okay.

9819
08:32:27,830 --> 08:32:28,230
Okay.

9820
08:32:29,490 --> 08:32:30,930
She's in the VR world.

9821
08:32:31,210 --> 08:32:31,550
No.

9822
08:32:42,400 --> 08:32:42,900
I'm back.

9823
08:32:43,800 --> 08:32:45,380
No, that's what I'm supposed to be saying.

9824
08:32:45,460 --> 08:32:47,300
I'm supposed to be saying okaeri to you.

9825
08:32:48,920 --> 08:32:49,860
Oh my goodness.

9826
08:32:52,020 --> 08:32:54,800
I feel like I might overthink this one.

9827
08:32:55,020 --> 08:32:55,860
A little bit.

9828
08:32:56,620 --> 08:32:57,700
How do we die?

9829
08:33:04,300 --> 08:33:05,680
How do we die?

9830
08:33:07,240 --> 08:33:08,200
But also...

9831
08:33:09,080 --> 08:33:10,440
Die in the game.

9832
08:33:11,280 --> 08:33:13,140
People overthink Outer Wilds all the time.

9833
08:33:19,220 --> 08:33:20,520
There's more slide reels?

9834
08:33:26,830 --> 08:33:27,370
But...

9835
08:33:30,660 --> 08:33:33,400
This one shows the brain activity.

9836
08:33:34,520 --> 08:33:35,660
And you go in.

9837
08:33:37,180 --> 08:33:39,360
And it's like, yeah, I'm sleeping.

9838
08:33:39,700 --> 08:33:41,200
I'm taking a little nap.

9839
08:33:41,300 --> 08:33:45,180
And then it goes inside the fire and the old man dies.

9840
08:33:52,440 --> 08:33:54,200
Wait, do I have to die by the fire?

9841
08:33:55,460 --> 08:33:57,020
Wait, do I have to die...

9842
08:33:57,020 --> 08:33:57,420
Wait.

9843
08:33:57,800 --> 08:33:57,860
Oop.

9844
08:33:59,820 --> 08:34:00,780
My bad.

9845
08:34:10,080 --> 08:34:13,080
As long as I'm within the range of the fire.

9846
08:34:16,780 --> 08:34:19,240
Maybe I could die... death by fire.

9847
08:34:22,280 --> 08:34:24,360
If I die by the fire...

9848
08:34:24,360 --> 08:34:26,720
If I die by the hands of the fire...

9849
08:34:26,720 --> 08:34:29,260
I am dying within the range of the fire.

9850
08:34:31,200 --> 08:34:32,040
I think.

9851
08:34:33,320 --> 08:34:34,180
Yeah, we're...

9852
08:34:34,180 --> 08:34:35,000
Oh my gosh.

9853
08:34:35,180 --> 08:34:36,460
You all told me to cook.

9854
08:34:36,700 --> 08:34:38,420
It was a hint after all.

9855
08:34:39,800 --> 08:34:41,920
That was the hint that we needed.

9856
08:34:42,600 --> 08:34:43,660
Just cook.

9857
08:34:46,360 --> 08:34:47,480
Just cook.

9858
08:34:47,480 --> 08:34:47,580
Just cook.

9859
08:34:47,580 --> 08:34:47,660
Just cook.

9860
08:34:51,000 --> 08:34:52,080
Oh my god.

9861
08:34:52,140 --> 08:34:53,320
You guys do love me.

9862
08:34:53,460 --> 08:34:54,880
You helped me after all.

9863
08:34:59,980 --> 08:35:01,740
Oh my god.

9864
08:35:02,060 --> 08:35:03,000
Oh my god.

9865
08:35:10,520 --> 08:35:11,760
Good landing.

9866
08:35:11,860 --> 08:35:12,460
Perfect landing.

9867
08:35:12,460 --> 08:35:12,620
This is the ending.

9868
08:35:18,940 --> 08:35:20,500
So we're going to...

9869
08:35:23,360 --> 08:35:24,160
go to...

9870
08:35:24,160 --> 08:35:28,020
Okay, so first we're going to go to the places that we've been going to.

9871
08:35:29,720 --> 08:35:31,620
Like I'm going to go to the tower first.

9872
08:35:31,960 --> 08:35:32,720
Wait, do we need to?

9873
08:35:34,500 --> 08:35:36,880
I guess... Yeah, I'm going to go to the tower first.

9874
08:35:38,960 --> 08:35:39,360
Because...

9875
08:35:39,360 --> 08:35:40,300
Um...

9876
08:35:44,360 --> 08:35:44,920
Because...

9877
08:35:44,920 --> 08:35:47,740
I want to get to the boat.

9878
08:35:48,460 --> 08:35:49,020
Yeah.

9879
08:35:50,500 --> 08:35:52,300
I want to get to the boat.

9880
08:35:52,900 --> 08:35:54,760
And then do all the boaty things.

9881
08:35:55,340 --> 08:35:58,180
And then once we're done with the boaty things, we...

9882
08:35:58,760 --> 08:35:59,320
can...

9883
08:35:59,920 --> 08:36:00,720
wake up.

9884
08:36:02,240 --> 08:36:03,360
And then die.

9885
08:36:05,700 --> 08:36:07,760
Yeah, we need at least one loading zone.

9886
08:36:07,860 --> 08:36:08,280
Exactly.

9887
08:36:11,100 --> 08:36:12,520
So, we'll do that.

9888
08:36:15,260 --> 08:36:16,780
Interesting that like...

9889
08:36:16,780 --> 08:36:18,800
we have... like the fire...

9890
08:36:18,800 --> 08:36:20,020
seems to be...

9891
08:36:20,020 --> 08:36:21,640
related to the ghost matter.

9892
08:36:21,860 --> 08:36:25,080
But when we're by the fire, we don't get a ghost matter...

9893
08:36:25,080 --> 08:36:25,580
like...

9894
08:36:26,660 --> 08:36:26,980
notification.

9895
08:36:30,640 --> 08:36:31,360
Guess I'll die.

9896
08:36:31,920 --> 08:36:33,060
So real.

9897
08:36:35,460 --> 08:36:36,660
Guess I'll die.

9898
08:36:36,660 --> 08:36:37,020
But...

9899
08:36:39,760 --> 08:36:40,800
Death by fire.

9900
08:36:40,880 --> 08:36:41,800
Into the video game.

9901
08:36:42,600 --> 08:36:43,580
And then once we...

9902
08:36:43,580 --> 08:36:44,700
Wait, but won't we be dead?

9903
08:36:45,340 --> 08:36:45,920
You know what?

9904
08:36:45,980 --> 08:36:47,300
Let's not think too hard about it.

9905
08:36:48,940 --> 08:36:50,600
Let's not think too hard about it.

9906
08:36:50,700 --> 08:36:51,080
You know?

9907
08:36:51,380 --> 08:36:51,660
Whoa.

9908
08:36:52,360 --> 08:36:52,760
Whoa.

9909
08:36:53,400 --> 08:36:53,800
Whoa.

9910
08:36:58,130 --> 08:36:58,530
Wow.

9911
08:37:01,770 --> 08:37:04,270
I mean, if you die in the game, you die in real life.

9912
08:37:04,390 --> 08:37:05,810
That literally doesn't apply to me.

9913
08:37:06,010 --> 08:37:06,410
So...

9914
08:37:10,650 --> 08:37:11,370
What am I gonna do?

9915
08:37:11,410 --> 08:37:11,930
Die again?

9916
08:37:19,020 --> 08:37:20,840
Yeah, we've already died so many times.

9917
08:37:20,880 --> 08:37:21,340
Let's one more.

9918
08:37:21,520 --> 08:37:21,960
Exactly.

9919
08:37:24,860 --> 08:37:26,060
I always love you...

9920
08:37:26,060 --> 08:37:26,940
but I've never...

9921
08:37:26,940 --> 08:37:28,100
played, so no help.

9922
08:37:32,040 --> 08:37:32,620
It's okay.

9923
08:37:33,760 --> 08:37:35,300
I'm glad that you're watching...

9924
08:37:35,300 --> 08:37:35,740
regardless.

9925
08:37:36,040 --> 08:37:37,120
Because I know a lot of people...

9926
08:37:37,120 --> 08:37:38,280
don't wanna watch...

9927
08:37:38,280 --> 08:37:39,560
Outer Wilds streams...

9928
08:37:39,560 --> 08:37:41,140
because they wanna experience it for themselves.

9929
08:37:41,400 --> 08:37:42,560
And I totally understand that.

9930
08:37:42,900 --> 08:37:44,760
And we're on part three of...

9931
08:37:44,760 --> 08:37:45,020
of a...

9932
08:37:46,480 --> 08:37:47,180
of a...

9933
08:37:47,520 --> 08:37:48,740
eight hour...

9934
08:37:48,740 --> 08:37:51,900
nine hour long stream now, almost.

9935
08:37:52,040 --> 08:37:52,560
So...

9936
08:37:52,560 --> 08:37:53,580
I get it.

9937
08:37:55,580 --> 08:37:56,260
Okay.

9938
08:37:58,080 --> 08:38:00,340
I appreciate you guys watching.

9939
08:38:01,400 --> 08:38:02,580
And anyway...

9940
08:38:02,580 --> 08:38:03,580
and you know...

9941
08:38:05,700 --> 08:38:06,380
There...

9942
08:38:06,380 --> 08:38:07,600
There's always like a...

9943
08:38:07,600 --> 08:38:08,240
you know...

9944
08:38:08,440 --> 08:38:10,100
being a content creator, right?

9945
08:38:10,160 --> 08:38:10,980
You have to think of like...

9946
08:38:10,980 --> 08:38:12,000
what's the popular thing...

9947
08:38:12,720 --> 08:38:13,400
versus...

9948
08:38:13,400 --> 08:38:14,840
what's the thing you want to do.

9949
08:38:16,080 --> 08:38:17,120
And truly like...

9950
08:38:17,120 --> 08:38:18,200
these kinds of games...

9951
08:38:20,160 --> 08:38:21,040
are like...

9952
08:38:22,780 --> 08:38:24,760
Sorry, my fan was making my like...

9953
08:38:24,760 --> 08:38:25,540
dress blow...

9954
08:38:25,540 --> 08:38:26,400
kind of weird.

9955
08:38:26,500 --> 08:38:27,560
And it was making me like...

9956
08:38:27,560 --> 08:38:28,860
feel like someone was touching my arm.

9957
08:38:30,180 --> 08:38:31,520
So it's kind of like...

9958
08:38:31,520 --> 08:38:32,160
you know...

9959
08:38:32,160 --> 08:38:32,860
when you play...

9960
08:38:33,400 --> 08:38:34,400
longer games...

9961
08:38:34,400 --> 08:38:34,660
it's...

9962
08:38:34,660 --> 08:38:36,160
it's much more...

9963
08:38:36,160 --> 08:38:36,880
feels like a...

9964
08:38:37,780 --> 08:38:38,660
a passion...

9965
08:38:38,660 --> 08:38:40,480
something that you would want to do.

9966
08:38:40,520 --> 08:38:41,020
You know what I mean?

9967
08:38:43,480 --> 08:38:43,880
That's why, I know.

9968
08:38:48,820 --> 08:38:49,420
Toonic Next?

9969
08:38:49,740 --> 08:38:50,940
Oh Toonic, um...

9970
08:38:50,940 --> 08:38:52,580
Kiara really liked that one.

9971
08:38:52,620 --> 08:38:52,920
Didn't she?

9972
08:38:53,540 --> 08:38:54,220
She like...

9973
08:38:54,220 --> 08:38:54,740
wanted that to be...

9974
08:38:54,740 --> 08:38:55,780
Game of the Year or something, right?

9975
08:38:59,600 --> 08:39:00,200
That's how...

9976
08:39:00,200 --> 08:39:00,960
that door opens?

9977
08:39:01,140 --> 08:39:01,280
Oh!

9978
08:39:08,440 --> 08:39:09,340
I'll always watch...

9979
08:39:09,340 --> 08:39:09,940
BitPlay anything.

9980
08:39:10,140 --> 08:39:11,000
I appreciate it.

9981
08:39:11,300 --> 08:39:11,800
You know.

9982
08:39:14,040 --> 08:39:14,440
Yeah...

9983
08:39:14,440 --> 08:39:15,320
Cause it's always just like...

9984
08:39:15,320 --> 08:39:16,380
What's the popular thing?

9985
08:39:16,380 --> 08:39:22,220
Saying what's gonna give me the views and then obviously what's the thing that I want to play and want to experience.

9986
08:39:22,640 --> 08:39:23,580
And this was one of them.

9987
08:39:23,600 --> 08:39:26,300
This is something I really really wanted to play.

9988
08:39:29,780 --> 08:39:30,900
Just streamer things.

9989
08:39:31,160 --> 08:39:31,740
I missed out.

9990
08:39:31,780 --> 08:39:32,700
8 hours was working.

9991
08:39:33,140 --> 08:39:35,620
Here we go.

9992
08:39:39,340 --> 08:39:42,200
We're in like endgame now, right?

9993
08:39:42,200 --> 08:39:43,120
So...

9994
08:39:51,260 --> 08:39:52,060
Tunic is great.

9995
08:39:52,960 --> 08:39:54,960
Is FNAF a popular streamer?

9996
08:39:55,920 --> 08:39:56,400
Streamer?

9997
08:39:57,180 --> 08:39:59,980
Oh my gosh, Freddy Fazbear, my Oshii streamer.

9998
08:40:01,060 --> 08:40:01,860
I don't know.

9999
08:40:02,280 --> 08:40:06,740
I can't... sometimes I can't really tell what's popular and what's not.

10000
08:40:08,700 --> 08:40:09,820
Even though it's my job.

10001
08:40:13,020 --> 08:40:14,340
She's gonna meet Matara.

10002
08:40:14,560 --> 08:40:15,080
Oh my god.

10003
08:40:17,080 --> 08:40:18,160
Is this... is this...

10004
08:40:18,180 --> 08:40:18,860
Is it Matara time?

10005
08:40:21,060 --> 08:40:21,580
Soon.

10006
08:40:21,820 --> 08:40:22,740
Matara time soon.

10007
08:40:25,700 --> 08:40:26,220
Wait.

10008
08:40:26,220 --> 08:40:27,000
Drop artifact.

10009
08:40:27,540 --> 08:40:28,180
There we go.

10010
08:40:30,220 --> 08:40:31,360
This should be far enough.

10011
08:40:31,400 --> 08:40:31,620
Yeah.

10012
08:40:31,700 --> 08:40:32,060
Perfect.

10013
08:40:33,820 --> 08:40:34,340
Okay.

10014
08:40:34,340 --> 08:40:35,740
We should play Suica game.

10015
08:40:35,940 --> 08:40:36,380
You know what?

10016
08:40:36,460 --> 08:40:39,760
I've never ever played Suica game before.

10017
08:40:42,400 --> 08:40:46,640
Even when it was so popular everybody was doing it, I had never played it.

10018
08:40:49,860 --> 08:40:54,600
When you're done with the DLC, I really recommend watching an Outer Wilds 100% speedrun.

10019
08:40:54,820 --> 08:40:56,760
They do some wild things, especially in the DLC.

10020
08:40:56,900 --> 08:40:57,960
Oh yeah, that sounds awesome.

10021
08:40:59,760 --> 08:41:01,260
Speedruns are so interesting.

10022
08:41:08,340 --> 08:41:10,040
It's kinda awful, but fun.

10023
08:41:10,680 --> 08:41:13,260
Yeah, that's the general consensus, right?

10024
08:41:17,020 --> 08:41:18,960
That's the general consensus, I'd say.

10025
08:41:20,160 --> 08:41:20,660
Uh...

10026
08:41:20,660 --> 08:41:22,360
Let's light some more pathways.

10027
08:41:23,460 --> 08:41:24,380
And such.

10028
08:41:24,700 --> 08:41:28,220
So I'm not completely blind going up here.

10029
08:41:35,520 --> 08:41:36,900
Pull the lever, Kronk.

10030
08:41:41,410 --> 08:41:42,290
What's your plan?

10031
08:41:42,610 --> 08:41:45,070
I think I'm gonna death by fire, I think.

10032
08:41:46,310 --> 08:41:47,230
Wah, Joy!

10033
08:41:47,870 --> 08:41:49,930
Thank you for the 50 gifts and thank you so much!

10034
08:41:52,550 --> 08:41:53,090
Mmm.

10035
08:41:53,470 --> 08:41:53,570
Mmm.

10036
08:41:54,130 --> 08:41:54,670
Mmm.

10037
08:41:56,130 --> 08:41:56,670
Mmm.

10038
08:41:56,670 --> 08:42:01,430
There's like a multiplayer now though for Suica game, so I think a lot of people have been playing it more.

10039
08:42:01,590 --> 08:42:02,570
Not a lot, I say that.

10040
08:42:04,110 --> 08:42:06,930
I usually forget solutions, so I'll be fine if I decide to play.

10041
08:42:17,470 --> 08:42:19,970
I think this is the only thing I know to do.

10042
08:42:20,630 --> 08:42:21,650
If I die, I die.

10043
08:42:22,690 --> 08:42:23,050
But...

10044
08:42:25,910 --> 08:42:28,570
I think I must die within the vicinity of here.

10045
08:42:31,710 --> 08:42:33,170
I don't know if the...

10046
08:42:33,170 --> 08:42:35,870
I don't think the elevator counts.

10047
08:42:36,930 --> 08:42:40,010
Is this what you would do to wake Amatara for the pause?

10048
08:42:45,330 --> 08:42:47,470
Wow, my controller is shaking so...

10049
08:42:48,750 --> 08:42:49,190
much.

10050
08:42:53,310 --> 08:42:53,750
Wait!

10051
08:42:54,670 --> 08:42:55,110
Wait.

10052
08:43:01,920 --> 08:43:02,780
Oh, oh, oh.

10053
08:43:03,020 --> 08:43:04,080
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

10054
08:43:04,200 --> 08:43:05,540
Okay, now we go to the...

10055
08:43:06,900 --> 08:43:07,880
I was like, wait a second.

10056
08:43:08,000 --> 08:43:08,100
Huh?

10057
08:43:08,220 --> 08:43:09,380
Yeah, I died in the game.

10058
08:43:09,540 --> 08:43:10,720
I was confused for a moment.

10059
08:43:11,260 --> 08:43:13,020
I was like, wait, how do I have all my stuff?

10060
08:43:13,540 --> 08:43:15,480
Okay, now we go to the bell.

10061
08:43:15,880 --> 08:43:16,560
I believe.

10062
08:43:17,480 --> 08:43:18,220
Echo bell.

10063
08:43:22,010 --> 08:43:22,890
And then...

10064
08:43:29,050 --> 08:43:30,050
Hopefully this works.

10065
08:43:30,470 --> 08:43:31,610
I hope this works.

10066
08:43:31,710 --> 08:43:32,510
I hope this works.

10067
08:43:33,950 --> 08:43:35,210
I hope this works.

10068
08:43:35,250 --> 08:43:35,970
I hope this works.

10069
08:43:38,330 --> 08:43:39,890
I just got fired!

10070
08:43:40,070 --> 08:43:41,530
Oh, Saio!

10071
08:43:41,530 --> 08:43:42,630
I'm so sorry!

10072
08:43:43,510 --> 08:43:44,790
I'm so sorry.

10073
08:43:46,310 --> 08:43:47,790
90 degree over here.

10074
08:43:48,330 --> 08:43:50,770
Everybody be careful not to get...

10075
08:43:50,770 --> 08:43:52,150
Now that it's actually summer.

10076
08:43:52,370 --> 08:43:55,010
Careful not to get heat stroke or anything like that.

10077
08:44:14,500 --> 08:44:15,980
It'll be spicy outside.

10078
08:44:16,560 --> 08:44:16,820
Yeah.

10079
08:44:20,120 --> 08:44:20,720
Okay.

10080
08:44:20,960 --> 08:44:22,480
Over here to the bell.

10081
08:44:23,960 --> 08:44:24,540
The structure.

10082
08:44:28,760 --> 08:44:29,080
Okay.

10083
08:44:34,100 --> 08:44:34,740
Okay.

10084
08:44:36,400 --> 08:44:38,220
Now we die here, everybody.

10085
08:44:38,600 --> 08:44:39,640
It's been an honor.

10086
08:44:42,420 --> 08:44:43,060
Everybody...

10087
08:44:44,500 --> 08:44:45,140
Play...

10088
08:44:47,060 --> 08:44:48,720
What's that song they play in the Titanic?

10089
08:44:49,200 --> 08:44:49,720
Wee!

10090
08:44:50,320 --> 08:44:50,960
Wee!

10091
08:44:51,140 --> 08:44:51,780
Wee!

10092
08:44:52,160 --> 08:44:52,480
Wee!

10093
08:44:52,480 --> 08:44:52,980
Wee!

10094
08:44:53,440 --> 08:44:54,740
I hope this works.

10095
08:44:54,940 --> 08:44:56,340
There's even one left!

10096
08:44:56,340 --> 08:44:56,880
Oh my gosh.

10097
08:44:57,040 --> 08:44:57,780
I hope this works!

10098
08:45:16,550 --> 08:45:17,430
It worked!

10099
08:45:21,090 --> 08:45:21,830
I cooked.

10100
08:45:23,670 --> 08:45:24,490
I cooked!

10101
08:45:30,330 --> 08:45:31,410
I cooked myself.

10102
08:45:31,930 --> 08:45:32,830
I cooked the meal.

10103
08:45:32,950 --> 08:45:33,570
I cooked the meal.

10104
08:45:37,760 --> 08:45:39,960
So now it shouldn't go off at all, right?

10105
08:45:47,010 --> 08:45:48,170
I guess we'll test it.

10106
08:45:48,910 --> 08:45:49,730
We'll test it.

10107
08:45:49,770 --> 08:45:50,230
We'll test it.

10108
08:45:50,350 --> 08:45:50,590
We'll test it.

10109
08:45:52,130 --> 08:45:53,670
Well, I guess also...

10110
08:45:54,490 --> 08:45:55,630
They still go off.

10111
08:45:56,990 --> 08:45:58,170
I just hear nothing.

10112
08:46:00,170 --> 08:46:00,630
Wow.

10113
08:46:00,710 --> 08:46:01,950
This is kind of dark, right?

10114
08:46:02,090 --> 08:46:02,890
It's kind of sad.

10115
08:46:04,550 --> 08:46:05,590
It's kind of dark.

10116
08:46:06,510 --> 08:46:06,970
Oh.

10117
08:46:11,000 --> 08:46:11,840
Here we go.

10118
08:46:23,560 --> 08:46:24,600
No turning back.

10119
08:46:25,280 --> 08:46:25,740
Okay.

10120
08:46:41,120 --> 08:46:41,580
Okay.

10121
08:46:41,580 --> 08:46:42,220
I'm scared.

10122
08:46:43,120 --> 08:46:43,520
What?

10123
08:46:43,600 --> 08:46:44,260
Thank you for the...

10124
08:46:47,940 --> 08:46:51,020
Well, it's worth watching you solve this game in some really creative ways.

10125
08:46:51,080 --> 08:46:51,520
It was a blast.

10126
08:46:51,620 --> 08:46:53,560
So hopefully food, bad eggs have a sour to your enjoyment.

10127
08:46:53,560 --> 08:46:54,360
Thank you, Jay.

10128
08:46:54,420 --> 08:46:55,480
I really appreciate it.

10129
08:46:55,540 --> 08:46:56,000
No, no.

10130
08:46:57,500 --> 08:46:58,140
Thank you.

10131
08:47:04,080 --> 08:47:04,960
It's really dark.

10132
08:47:05,100 --> 08:47:06,080
I can't see a single thing.

10133
08:47:06,260 --> 08:47:07,360
Just a little bit of the walls.

10134
08:47:08,840 --> 08:47:09,900
It's so dark.

10135
08:47:10,960 --> 08:47:11,920
Oh, there's a light.

10136
08:47:17,710 --> 08:47:18,430
There's a staircase.

10137
08:47:19,350 --> 08:47:20,850
There's some creepy sounds.

10138
08:47:20,990 --> 08:47:21,430
So, I'm going to go to the other side.

10139
08:47:21,430 --> 08:47:22,150
There's some spooky sounds.

10140
08:47:24,430 --> 08:47:25,350
What's in here?

10141
08:47:29,990 --> 08:47:30,470
Oh.

10142
08:47:31,710 --> 08:47:32,190
Wow.

10143
08:47:40,680 --> 08:47:41,160
Okay.

10144
08:47:43,000 --> 08:47:43,880
Oh, it's a...

10145
08:47:44,920 --> 08:47:45,720
It's a room?

10146
08:47:52,160 --> 08:47:52,640
Oh.

10147
08:47:52,900 --> 08:47:53,380
Oh.

10148
08:47:53,480 --> 08:47:53,800
Wait.

10149
08:47:53,880 --> 08:47:54,800
I haven't looked through here yet.

10150
08:47:55,880 --> 08:47:56,900
I can look through.

10151
08:47:58,040 --> 08:47:58,680
One, two...

10152
08:47:58,680 --> 08:47:59,760
Oh, they're looking at the planet.

10153
08:47:59,880 --> 08:48:00,300
Their home planet.

10154
08:48:02,700 --> 08:48:03,180
Oh.

10155
08:48:03,380 --> 08:48:03,860
Oh.

10156
08:48:03,880 --> 08:48:05,680
Insert the card.

10157
08:48:06,880 --> 08:48:07,660
Oh.

10158
08:48:07,820 --> 08:48:09,280
Oh, what's going on?

10159
08:48:10,860 --> 08:48:11,640
Okay.

10160
08:48:19,310 --> 08:48:20,090
Here?

10161
08:48:28,860 --> 08:48:30,200
Nothing in here?

10162
08:48:31,080 --> 08:48:32,360
Anyone around?

10163
08:48:34,120 --> 08:48:35,260
What is this?

10164
08:48:36,300 --> 08:48:37,380
What is that?

10165
08:48:38,100 --> 08:48:39,300
There are instruments.

10166
08:48:40,620 --> 08:48:41,400
Okay.

10167
08:48:47,470 --> 08:48:47,910
Boat.

10168
08:48:49,330 --> 08:48:52,950
Their game, it's like a, it's like showing their, what's it called?

10169
08:48:54,290 --> 08:48:54,730
Hi!

10170
08:49:03,500 --> 08:49:04,280
Wait, it's him!

10171
08:49:04,700 --> 08:49:08,040
It's the guy with his... with the, with the, with the, with the... trailer.

10172
08:49:08,680 --> 08:49:09,480
Oh my god.

10173
08:49:12,680 --> 08:49:13,120
Hi.

10174
08:49:17,280 --> 08:49:19,000
Talk to the Prisoner.

10175
08:49:19,020 --> 08:49:20,460
So he has been in here.

10176
08:49:22,160 --> 08:49:23,260
Who are you?

10177
08:49:31,150 --> 08:49:32,250
I thought I would...

10178
08:49:32,250 --> 08:49:34,570
Oh, sorry.

10179
08:49:34,690 --> 08:49:35,250
I'm in your way.

10180
08:49:36,190 --> 08:49:37,330
He's trying to walk.

10181
08:49:38,230 --> 08:49:40,450
I'm just standing here.

10182
08:49:44,440 --> 08:49:45,260
Thank you.

10183
08:49:46,620 --> 08:49:47,140
Okay.

10184
08:50:00,370 --> 08:50:01,770
He woke up before them.

10185
08:50:10,720 --> 08:50:11,340
What the?

10186
08:50:12,900 --> 08:50:13,420
Why?

10187
08:50:13,740 --> 08:50:14,840
Why did you do that?

10188
08:50:19,140 --> 08:50:23,700
He was just like, Yawn, I'm gonna casually unleash craziness upon the universe.

10189
08:50:28,690 --> 08:50:30,410
And they sealed him away.

10190
08:50:36,100 --> 08:50:37,500
Yo, that's so dark.

10191
08:50:40,960 --> 08:50:43,720
And they were like, no, no, no more eye anymore.

10192
08:50:44,000 --> 08:50:44,700
We hate the eye.

10193
08:50:56,320 --> 08:50:58,160
Isn't it the same as...

10194
08:50:59,760 --> 08:51:01,100
Oh gosh, that one...

10195
08:51:01,100 --> 08:51:01,680
That one...

10196
08:51:01,680 --> 08:51:02,880
That one...

10197
08:51:03,420 --> 08:51:05,520
No-Mayan who was just like...

10198
08:51:05,520 --> 08:51:07,180
I thought the eye was evil, but it's not.

10199
08:51:07,540 --> 08:51:09,240
So they saw the vision...

10200
08:51:09,240 --> 08:51:10,480
Already holding artifact.

10201
08:51:10,640 --> 08:51:11,140
Oh, thank you.

10202
08:51:12,380 --> 08:51:12,860
Maybe...

10203
08:51:14,680 --> 08:51:16,040
Maybe they saw...

10204
08:51:16,040 --> 08:51:18,140
Maybe the vision they saw was if the...

10205
08:51:18,900 --> 08:51:22,460
Was if there's no...

10206
08:51:23,380 --> 08:51:25,180
Oh, we're showing him our memories now?

10207
08:51:29,050 --> 08:51:29,490
Hello?

10208
08:51:30,130 --> 08:51:30,570
Hello?

10209
08:51:31,710 --> 08:51:32,790
I don't know what's going on.

10210
08:51:38,160 --> 08:51:38,600
Oh!

10211
08:51:39,440 --> 08:51:40,020
You good?

10212
08:51:41,220 --> 08:51:41,960
Oh, there you go.

10213
08:51:43,240 --> 08:51:43,880
Oh, sorry.

10214
08:51:44,020 --> 08:51:44,780
I have to hold it.

10215
08:51:49,500 --> 08:51:49,940
Oh!

10216
08:51:50,860 --> 08:51:51,240
Oh!

10217
08:51:51,600 --> 08:51:52,400
It's me!

10218
08:52:21,560 --> 08:52:22,200
The signal...

10219
08:52:25,820 --> 08:52:26,140
What?

10220
08:52:49,350 --> 08:52:50,230
Oh, this is the first...

10221
08:52:50,230 --> 08:52:50,550
Okay, yeah.

10222
08:52:50,590 --> 08:52:52,610
This is the first time because then they launch to the...

10223
08:52:53,230 --> 08:52:53,870
The thingy.

10224
08:52:54,470 --> 08:52:55,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10225
08:52:58,750 --> 08:52:59,390
And then...

10226
08:52:59,390 --> 08:53:01,730
And then they all die because of the...

10227
08:53:02,550 --> 08:53:03,190
Internal burn.

10228
08:53:11,690 --> 08:53:12,310
Then that's me!

10229
08:53:13,250 --> 08:53:14,470
Well, that might not be me.

10230
08:53:14,630 --> 08:53:15,810
It might be someone else, but you know.

10231
08:53:17,090 --> 08:53:17,850
There's someone!

10232
08:53:18,210 --> 08:53:19,170
It was just like...

10233
08:53:19,170 --> 08:53:19,350
Whoa!

10234
08:53:20,070 --> 08:53:20,950
Whoa!

10235
08:53:22,270 --> 08:53:23,370
That's crazy speak.

10236
08:53:24,170 --> 08:53:24,610
Whoa!

10237
08:53:25,210 --> 08:53:25,830
That's me!

10238
08:53:26,010 --> 08:53:26,570
That's me!

10239
08:53:27,470 --> 08:53:28,770
Feldspar, yeah.

10240
08:53:32,530 --> 08:53:33,470
That's me!

10241
08:53:36,270 --> 08:53:37,270
That's me!

10242
08:53:56,940 --> 08:53:57,380
Whoa!

10243
08:53:58,560 --> 08:53:59,040
Aww!

10244
08:54:10,710 --> 08:54:11,210
Can I ask him...

10245
08:54:11,210 --> 08:54:12,570
He had another question though.

10246
08:54:17,550 --> 08:54:18,430
Where are we going?

10247
08:54:26,330 --> 08:54:27,310
Artifact does not fit.

10248
08:54:28,630 --> 08:54:29,330
There you go.

10249
08:54:29,450 --> 08:54:30,090
Vision torch.

10250
08:54:34,040 --> 08:54:35,260
That was so good.

10251
08:54:36,140 --> 08:54:37,440
Made me kind of teary.

10252
08:54:39,800 --> 08:54:40,280
Wait!

10253
08:54:40,400 --> 08:54:41,120
Oh, wait!

10254
08:54:41,360 --> 08:54:42,000
Oh, wait!

10255
08:54:55,480 --> 08:54:57,020
Did I get duped?

10256
08:54:57,380 --> 08:54:57,860
Did I get duped?

10257
08:54:57,860 --> 08:54:57,920
Oh, no!

10258
08:54:58,740 --> 08:54:59,220
Oh!

10259
08:55:02,230 --> 08:55:03,390
Maybe it's not so bad.

10260
08:55:09,800 --> 08:55:11,500
It's nice and quiet in here, you know?

10261
08:55:12,140 --> 08:55:13,220
Wait, I hear something.

10262
08:55:14,200 --> 08:55:19,560
It's through your efforts to release the echoes of the eye that the new mind reached our solar system and gave me.

10263
08:55:19,820 --> 08:55:21,800
Oh, I don't think I was supposed to read that.

10264
08:55:24,240 --> 08:55:25,300
Well, I can go up to Logan.

10265
08:55:25,360 --> 08:55:25,760
Bye!

10266
08:55:34,990 --> 08:55:35,690
So pretty.

10267
08:55:45,450 --> 08:55:46,390
Where are you, friend?

10268
08:55:46,390 --> 08:55:48,090
I released you.

10269
08:55:48,130 --> 08:55:48,990
Please don't jump scare me.

10270
08:55:49,330 --> 08:55:50,250
I will scream.

10271
08:55:50,610 --> 08:55:51,630
Please don't jump scare me.

10272
08:55:51,690 --> 08:55:52,490
Please don't jump scare me.

10273
08:55:53,210 --> 08:55:54,190
Please don't jump scare me.

10274
08:55:56,930 --> 08:55:57,810
Oh, it's not a spoiler?

10275
08:55:58,030 --> 08:55:58,130
Okay.

10276
08:56:27,780 --> 08:56:28,580
No, stop!

10277
08:56:28,720 --> 08:56:29,900
We're gonna go travel together!

10278
08:56:38,820 --> 08:56:39,800
Where is he though?

10279
08:56:49,520 --> 08:56:49,920
Footprints.

10280
08:56:51,820 --> 08:56:52,700
Oh, thank you.

10281
08:56:53,160 --> 08:56:53,680
I can barely see them.

10282
08:56:53,780 --> 08:56:53,860
Oh!

10283
08:56:58,620 --> 08:56:59,940
So he's like, wake up.

10284
08:57:00,200 --> 08:57:00,940
Wake up, man.

10285
08:57:01,000 --> 08:57:01,300
Wake up.

10286
08:57:02,360 --> 08:57:03,140
Okay, here I go.

10287
08:57:03,580 --> 08:57:04,420
I'm gonna wake up!

10288
08:57:23,850 --> 08:57:24,970
We freed him though.

10289
08:57:27,410 --> 08:57:28,630
Now we can't wake up.

10290
08:57:29,630 --> 08:57:30,730
But we can.

10291
08:57:30,970 --> 08:57:31,470
But we can't.

10292
08:57:45,520 --> 08:57:46,540
But we freed him.

10293
08:57:51,760 --> 08:57:53,520
Now beat the game for a new ending.

10294
08:57:53,820 --> 08:57:54,520
Oh, okay, okay.

10295
08:57:59,400 --> 08:57:59,680
Um...

10296
08:58:03,080 --> 08:58:05,060
Does that mean I have to go back into what's it called?

10297
08:58:05,900 --> 08:58:06,180
Wait.

10298
08:58:06,620 --> 08:58:07,880
I'm trying to remember how to beat the game.

10299
08:58:08,880 --> 08:58:10,140
Do I just go to the moon?

10300
08:58:10,280 --> 08:58:11,480
Wait, how do I beat the game again?

10301
08:58:12,140 --> 08:58:13,500
No, I have to go to the Bramble?

10302
08:58:13,600 --> 08:58:14,180
No way.

10303
08:58:15,380 --> 08:58:17,000
Oh no, I have to go to the Bramble!

10304
08:58:19,060 --> 08:58:21,080
You'll like the new ending, I hope.

10305
08:58:21,240 --> 08:58:22,860
That's a big ask, for real.

10306
08:58:23,120 --> 08:58:25,220
Just going, casually going to the Bramble.

10307
08:58:26,500 --> 08:58:26,980
Okay.

10308
08:58:27,980 --> 08:58:29,840
Oh well, luckily...

10309
08:58:29,840 --> 08:58:30,080
Okay.

10310
08:58:31,020 --> 08:58:34,160
I will need your guys' assistance here though, if that's okay.

10311
08:58:35,620 --> 08:58:36,580
It's because...

10312
08:58:38,540 --> 08:58:40,340
First of all, let me go find it.

10313
08:58:41,780 --> 08:58:42,260
Because...

10314
08:58:42,940 --> 08:58:45,020
I don't quite remember...

10315
08:58:45,020 --> 08:58:46,980
everything about how to...

10316
08:58:46,980 --> 08:58:49,400
navigate the Bramble, so...

10317
08:58:49,940 --> 08:58:51,520
Thank you for the...

10318
08:58:52,180 --> 08:58:53,900
Thank you for the Akasuba!

10319
08:58:54,040 --> 08:58:54,400
Thank you!

10320
08:58:54,700 --> 08:58:55,820
Wait, I can't...

10321
08:58:55,820 --> 08:58:57,620
Oh, it won't let me lock on it.

10322
08:58:58,000 --> 08:58:58,640
Oh no.

10323
08:59:02,080 --> 08:59:03,700
Ash Twin for the Warp Core.

10324
08:59:08,200 --> 08:59:09,800
Oh gosh, you guys are...

10325
08:59:09,800 --> 08:59:10,380
Oh my god.

10326
08:59:10,460 --> 08:59:11,400
Wait, this is...

10327
08:59:11,400 --> 08:59:14,040
Oh my gosh, I don't remember how to do any of this!

10328
08:59:14,260 --> 08:59:14,880
Oh god.

10329
08:59:15,020 --> 08:59:15,340
Okay.

10330
08:59:15,340 --> 08:59:15,520
Okay.

10331
08:59:16,400 --> 08:59:16,800
Guys...

10332
08:59:17,300 --> 08:59:18,080
I'm gonna do my best.

10333
08:59:18,220 --> 08:59:19,580
I hope I can do it in this...

10334
08:59:21,480 --> 08:59:23,780
Oh my god, I don't remember how to do any of this.

10335
08:59:24,700 --> 08:59:25,600
This is pretty bad.

10336
08:59:25,960 --> 08:59:28,480
I didn't realize I was gonna have to do the game all over again.

10337
08:59:31,020 --> 08:59:35,340
But I go on Ash Twin and I wait for the sun?

10338
08:59:36,880 --> 08:59:37,660
Oh my god.

10339
08:59:40,180 --> 08:59:41,860
Oh gosh, this is so bad.

10340
08:59:46,450 --> 08:59:47,270
Oh my god.

10341
08:59:48,270 --> 08:59:49,490
Thank you, Asu!

10342
08:59:55,810 --> 09:00:00,110
And I just kind of like orbit around here until it dissolves enough, right?

10343
09:00:00,830 --> 09:00:02,890
I think I remember...

10344
09:00:02,890 --> 09:00:06,070
It's like using the landing mode.

10345
09:00:08,670 --> 09:00:09,950
What the hell?

10346
09:00:10,170 --> 09:00:10,930
There we go.

10347
09:00:13,190 --> 09:00:14,450
To find it, maybe?

10348
09:00:16,110 --> 09:00:16,550
Okay.

10349
09:00:17,610 --> 09:00:18,770
Which tower is it?

10350
09:00:18,830 --> 09:00:19,550
I don't remember!

10351
09:00:19,890 --> 09:00:20,770
Oh my gosh, you guys.

10352
09:00:20,850 --> 09:00:22,370
This is really bad because I don't...

10353
09:00:22,370 --> 09:00:23,470
I'm not gonna remember anything.

10354
09:00:25,570 --> 09:00:26,010
Oh.

10355
09:00:29,130 --> 09:00:31,190
You need the escape pod rai...

10356
09:00:31,190 --> 09:00:33,390
Wait, there's so much stuff that I need first?

10357
09:00:34,750 --> 09:00:38,230
This is so bad because I should have...

10358
09:00:38,230 --> 09:00:41,670
If I had known all of this, I would have done it on my...

10359
09:00:42,310 --> 09:00:43,870
I would have done it on my old account.

10360
09:00:44,170 --> 09:00:44,930
Oh no.

10361
09:00:48,450 --> 09:00:48,850
What?

10362
09:00:52,310 --> 09:00:53,110
This is...

10363
09:00:53,110 --> 09:00:53,890
Oh no!

10364
09:01:05,240 --> 09:01:07,920
Because I'm gonna need you guys to like handhold me through everything.

10365
09:01:08,120 --> 09:01:09,920
Because I don't know what I need to do.

10366
09:01:10,380 --> 09:01:11,860
And that's gonna be really frustrating.

10367
09:01:12,160 --> 09:01:13,040
Oh my god.

10368
09:01:14,200 --> 09:01:15,580
You can look up the codes.

10369
09:01:20,290 --> 09:01:22,930
But don't I still need the Ash Twin thing?

10370
09:01:23,030 --> 09:01:23,610
I need the...

10371
09:01:23,610 --> 09:01:25,010
I need to turn the thing off.

10372
09:01:27,270 --> 09:01:28,890
I need to turn off the project.

10373
09:01:47,650 --> 09:01:49,510
It's the Ash Twin Towers here.

10374
09:01:49,630 --> 09:01:49,910
Okay.

10375
09:01:52,870 --> 09:01:56,650
And then when I go to the fish, someone said find Feldspar.

10376
09:01:57,430 --> 09:01:58,070
How do...

10377
09:01:58,070 --> 09:01:58,390
I don't...

10378
09:01:58,390 --> 09:02:00,330
Do I locate him with the...

10379
09:02:02,970 --> 09:02:03,850
Oh no!

10380
09:02:03,850 --> 09:02:07,620
Oh my gosh.

10381
09:02:08,600 --> 09:02:15,060
Swipe the core from the ATP, fly to the vessel, through Bramble, input LXN into coordinates.

10382
09:02:16,220 --> 09:02:17,180
Okay, which...

10383
09:02:17,180 --> 09:02:18,080
We can get the...

10384
09:02:18,080 --> 09:02:19,740
We can get the coordinates.

10385
09:02:22,000 --> 09:02:24,500
Let's watch a speedrun right now and do what they do easy.

10386
09:02:25,220 --> 09:02:26,080
Oh my god.

10387
09:02:31,440 --> 09:02:32,460
Oh my god.

10388
09:02:32,520 --> 09:02:33,720
This is so...

10389
09:02:39,860 --> 09:02:42,580
I just watched a video because I couldn't be bothered.

10390
09:02:46,120 --> 09:02:46,580
That's...

10391
09:02:46,580 --> 09:02:48,080
You know, that's so fair.

10392
09:02:48,360 --> 09:02:48,600
That...

10393
09:02:48,600 --> 09:02:49,920
You're so valid for that.

10394
09:02:50,160 --> 09:02:51,660
You're so valid for that.

10395
09:02:51,740 --> 09:02:52,480
Google the ending.

10396
09:02:52,540 --> 09:02:53,600
Give me the controller.

10397
09:02:53,720 --> 09:02:54,340
I'll do it.

10398
09:02:56,960 --> 09:02:59,620
Yeah, I already have Solanum.

10399
09:02:59,680 --> 09:03:00,540
I already got them.

10400
09:03:03,420 --> 09:03:05,200
Let me just try once, I suppose.

10401
09:03:06,460 --> 09:03:08,880
I don't think it'll all come back to me in this...

10402
09:03:08,880 --> 09:03:10,900
In a glorious moment, I'll be honest.

10403
09:03:11,500 --> 09:03:13,380
I don't think it'll come back to me at all.

10404
09:03:15,720 --> 09:03:16,100
But...

10405
09:03:18,080 --> 09:03:19,140
No, no, no, no, no.

10406
09:03:19,180 --> 09:03:19,900
Get me out of there.

10407
09:03:21,000 --> 09:03:21,380
But...

10408
09:03:22,420 --> 09:03:25,040
Okay, there's the sun.

10409
09:03:25,460 --> 09:03:26,740
We need this one, right?

10410
09:03:26,860 --> 09:03:27,220
Because we're...

10411
09:03:27,220 --> 09:03:27,940
Wait, hold on.

10412
09:03:28,200 --> 09:03:29,140
No, it's that...

10413
09:03:29,140 --> 09:03:30,660
It's the twin tower, right?

10414
09:03:30,800 --> 09:03:31,160
Wait.

10415
09:03:35,200 --> 09:03:36,780
The sun is to go to the sun station.

10416
09:03:38,240 --> 09:03:39,360
We need the twins.

10417
09:03:41,880 --> 09:03:43,680
Stranger, I'm gonna get you out of here.

10418
09:03:43,780 --> 09:03:44,600
I don't wanna...

10419
09:03:44,600 --> 09:03:45,140
You know...

10420
09:03:45,660 --> 09:03:47,640
I'm gonna just unclick you for now.

10421
09:03:47,800 --> 09:03:47,900
Oh.

10422
09:03:48,800 --> 09:03:49,900
I'm just gonna un...

10423
09:03:49,900 --> 09:03:50,940
There we go.

10424
09:03:51,020 --> 09:03:51,280
Okay.

10425
09:03:56,870 --> 09:03:58,210
But the broken roof.

10426
09:03:58,730 --> 09:03:59,210
Yes.

10427
09:03:59,710 --> 09:04:00,150
Yes.

10428
09:04:00,910 --> 09:04:01,630
It's like...

10429
09:04:01,630 --> 09:04:03,290
I remember the timing is quite tight.

10430
09:04:05,050 --> 09:04:08,590
Because there's like Bramble in there and stuff that I have to get through.

10431
09:04:08,590 --> 09:04:09,230
Very quickly.

10432
09:04:17,170 --> 09:04:18,230
Was it that?

10433
09:04:18,350 --> 09:04:18,810
That was it?

10434
09:04:18,870 --> 09:04:19,310
Right there?

10435
09:04:20,750 --> 09:04:21,210
Wait.

10436
09:04:21,330 --> 09:04:21,570
Oh.

10437
09:04:21,650 --> 09:04:22,090
Oh.

10438
09:04:23,290 --> 09:04:24,270
I lost it.

10439
09:04:25,010 --> 09:04:25,470
There?

10440
09:04:25,890 --> 09:04:26,630
Is that it?

10441
09:04:36,680 --> 09:04:38,260
Don't remember which one it is though.

10442
09:04:38,920 --> 09:04:39,200
Yeah.

10443
09:04:39,400 --> 09:04:40,080
Oh my god.

10444
09:04:40,180 --> 09:04:40,640
Yeah.

10445
09:04:41,020 --> 09:04:41,480
Yeah.

10446
09:04:42,900 --> 09:04:43,360
Okay.

10447
09:04:46,710 --> 09:04:48,890
I think if I land like here, I'm safe.

10448
09:04:49,970 --> 09:04:50,430
Probably.

10449
09:04:53,430 --> 09:04:54,190
We need to...

10450
09:04:54,210 --> 09:04:56,110
Go to the vessel once first.

10451
09:04:56,290 --> 09:04:59,090
You can reach it again with the marker like you used for the stranger.

10452
09:05:01,670 --> 09:05:02,450
The vessel?

10453
09:05:03,490 --> 09:05:04,590
Why do I need to go there?

10454
09:05:11,600 --> 09:05:12,440
Hello, interloper.

10455
09:05:13,320 --> 09:05:14,920
It's all your fault.

10456
09:05:16,140 --> 09:05:16,520
Okay.

10457
09:05:22,080 --> 09:05:25,440
But people said that I can just get the eye cords from...

10458
09:05:25,440 --> 09:05:25,840
Wait.

10459
09:05:25,900 --> 09:05:27,420
Is this the one that's broken or that one?

10460
09:05:33,300 --> 09:05:33,860
Not that one.

10461
09:05:33,880 --> 09:05:34,100
Maybe this one.

10462
09:05:34,240 --> 09:05:34,300
Wait.

10463
09:05:35,000 --> 09:05:35,760
Maybe this one.

10464
09:05:36,540 --> 09:05:38,160
People said I can just look up the coordinates.

10465
09:05:38,260 --> 09:05:39,540
So I think I'm just gonna do that.

10466
09:05:39,780 --> 09:05:40,480
Not gonna lie.

10467
09:05:40,860 --> 09:05:42,280
I think I'm just gonna look them up.

10468
09:05:47,860 --> 09:05:48,500
Oh my god.

10469
09:05:49,360 --> 09:05:49,720
Yeah.

10470
09:05:54,430 --> 09:05:58,210
So even if I don't have it, I'll just look it up.

10471
09:05:58,250 --> 09:05:58,830
It's no biggie.

10472
09:06:08,960 --> 09:06:10,140
Am I still on the equator?

10473
09:06:17,360 --> 09:06:18,840
I don't even know where the vessel is.

10474
09:06:19,620 --> 09:06:22,120
Why did I do it on this save?

10475
09:06:22,300 --> 09:06:23,640
I thought it would be safe.

10476
09:06:24,580 --> 09:06:25,620
Oh man.

10477
09:06:25,860 --> 09:06:26,320
I'm so...

10478
09:06:29,720 --> 09:06:32,400
I don't even remember how to do this part either.

10479
09:06:32,680 --> 09:06:33,080
Oh gosh.

10480
09:06:43,550 --> 09:06:46,390
I think I would just prefer to watch the ending.

10481
09:06:46,690 --> 09:06:48,410
If that's okay with you guys.

10482
09:06:49,150 --> 09:06:51,370
You know, I've already done all of this before.

10483
09:06:51,510 --> 09:06:52,030
Oh my god.

10484
09:06:52,790 --> 09:06:58,230
And if you really want to see me do it again, I'm sure there are ways.

10485
09:06:59,010 --> 09:07:01,690
You know, it might just be projected into your brain.

10486
09:07:01,830 --> 09:07:04,250
I can do it with my ghostly powers, you know?

10487
09:07:11,010 --> 09:07:17,970
So... I think... I think because there's like multiple things about this where I...

10488
09:07:18,770 --> 09:07:20,070
You know...

10489
09:07:20,070 --> 09:07:21,790
Okay, so what is this one?

10490
09:07:21,990 --> 09:07:25,510
I... If I had... What's the word?

10491
09:07:25,590 --> 09:07:26,470
If I had...

10492
09:07:28,830 --> 09:07:38,130
If I had done this on the save that wasn't completely wiped, I'd be more down for doing it.

10493
09:07:38,250 --> 09:07:38,690
But...

10494
09:07:39,770 --> 09:07:42,990
Right now, it's just not feeling...

10495
09:07:44,590 --> 09:07:45,710
so great.

10496
09:07:53,710 --> 09:07:55,590
Am I... I don't even know if I'm in the right one.

10497
09:07:57,250 --> 09:07:58,710
I don't think I'm in the right one.

10498
09:08:01,750 --> 09:08:06,390
Congrats on getting through the DLC, but I had a great time watching you cook figuratively and literally.

10499
09:08:06,630 --> 09:08:07,170
Thank you.

10500
09:08:11,030 --> 09:08:12,410
Maybe I was in the right one.

10501
09:08:12,830 --> 09:08:13,230
Wait.

10502
09:08:14,410 --> 09:08:15,270
This goes up.

10503
09:08:17,770 --> 09:08:19,150
Maybe I was in the right one.

10504
09:08:25,510 --> 09:08:25,870
Wait.

10505
09:08:25,950 --> 09:08:27,310
I don't think I'm in the right building.

10506
09:08:27,730 --> 09:08:29,730
This is not the right... This is not the correct building.

10507
09:08:42,480 --> 09:08:42,840
Wait.

10508
09:08:42,900 --> 09:08:43,800
Then do I...

10509
09:08:51,010 --> 09:08:51,370
Oh.

10510
09:08:54,030 --> 09:08:55,770
I was supposed to walk in the purple.

10511
09:08:56,170 --> 09:08:56,530
Okay.

10512
09:08:56,550 --> 09:08:56,850
Hold on.

10513
09:08:56,890 --> 09:08:57,270
We'll wait.

10514
09:08:57,330 --> 09:08:57,590
We'll wait.

10515
09:08:58,150 --> 09:08:58,990
Just to watch a video.

10516
09:08:59,050 --> 09:08:59,950
This could take some time.

10517
09:09:01,730 --> 09:09:03,950
I completely... You guys, please understand.

10518
09:09:04,310 --> 09:09:05,970
It's been so long and also...

10519
09:09:07,010 --> 09:09:09,370
So much has happened since I last played.

10520
09:09:14,180 --> 09:09:15,720
I think...

10521
09:09:15,720 --> 09:09:16,260
I think...

10522
09:09:16,260 --> 09:09:17,660
You know... It doesn't...

10523
09:09:20,800 --> 09:09:23,160
feel so great.

10524
09:09:23,280 --> 09:09:24,660
Just because...

10525
09:09:25,720 --> 09:09:28,960
Because it's just of watching a video.

10526
09:09:31,000 --> 09:09:32,600
It's just...

10527
09:09:32,840 --> 09:09:35,360
For the sake of my mental health.

10528
09:09:42,480 --> 09:09:44,060
What do I...

10529
09:09:44,720 --> 09:09:45,200
Oh.

10530
09:09:45,200 --> 09:09:45,300
Oh.

10531
09:09:46,280 --> 09:09:47,760
Outer Wilds ending...

10532
09:09:49,180 --> 09:09:49,640
Okay.

10533
09:09:50,380 --> 09:09:52,180
It's 20 minutes long!

10534
09:09:53,260 --> 09:09:55,560
This person's video is 20 minutes long!

10535
09:09:55,760 --> 09:09:56,380
No way!

10536
09:09:57,000 --> 09:09:57,740
Holy cow.

10537
09:09:59,900 --> 09:10:00,360
Okay.

10538
09:10:02,320 --> 09:10:03,840
Yeah, I'm gonna check it real quick.

10539
09:10:04,040 --> 09:10:05,780
I'm gonna turn off the audio so you can hear it.

10540
09:10:07,780 --> 09:10:09,120
Okay, just pretend it's me!

10541
09:10:09,260 --> 09:10:09,460
Okay?

10542
09:10:09,540 --> 09:10:10,000
We'll just...

10543
09:10:12,040 --> 09:10:13,700
We'll just all pretend it's me, right?

10544
09:10:14,100 --> 09:10:14,560
Yeah.

10545
09:10:15,200 --> 09:10:18,240
I won't... I'm not even gonna... Hold on, I'm gonna make sure there's no...

10546
09:10:19,220 --> 09:10:21,280
Okay, I'm gonna pretend there's no voiceover or anything.

10547
09:10:21,900 --> 09:10:22,300
Okay.

10548
09:10:22,660 --> 09:10:23,360
It's... Alright.

10549
09:10:23,740 --> 09:10:25,720
Spend the next 20 minutes with me, everybody!

10550
09:10:26,320 --> 09:10:28,360
Give me a second, I'm gonna put it up on the screen.

10551
09:10:28,540 --> 09:10:29,460
I'm gonna full screen it.

10552
09:10:35,860 --> 09:10:37,280
There we go, 1080p.

10553
09:10:38,140 --> 09:10:39,320
Okay, just pretend it's me.

10554
09:10:39,420 --> 09:10:39,980
Just pretend it's me.

10555
09:10:40,640 --> 09:10:41,040
Okay.

10556
09:10:46,710 --> 09:10:48,270
I gotta resize it.

10557
09:10:48,390 --> 09:10:48,850
Give me a second.

10558
09:10:49,070 --> 09:10:49,730
There we go.

10559
09:10:50,570 --> 09:10:50,930
Okay.

10560
09:10:52,450 --> 09:10:53,350
Oh, hold on.

10561
09:10:53,370 --> 09:10:54,470
Let me get you guys in as well.

10562
09:10:54,730 --> 09:10:55,370
Everybody in?

10563
09:10:55,510 --> 09:10:56,110
Come on in!

10564
09:10:56,230 --> 09:10:56,350
Oh.

10565
09:10:56,890 --> 09:10:57,430
Hold on.

10566
09:10:57,570 --> 09:10:58,210
Everybody in!

10567
09:10:58,350 --> 09:10:59,090
Come on in!

10568
09:11:02,090 --> 09:11:03,070
Oh, there we go.

10569
09:11:03,150 --> 09:11:03,550
There we go.

10570
09:11:03,610 --> 09:11:04,270
You guys are in.

10571
09:11:04,750 --> 09:11:05,110
Okay!

10572
09:11:18,010 --> 09:11:19,790
This is me putting in the coordinates!

10573
09:11:20,350 --> 09:11:21,250
Oh, audio, don't go.

10574
09:11:22,070 --> 09:11:22,430
Sorry.

10575
09:11:25,070 --> 09:11:26,690
This is me putting in the coordinates!

10576
09:11:27,430 --> 09:11:29,090
This is me putting in the coordinates!

10577
09:11:40,360 --> 09:11:40,760
Yes!

10578
09:11:41,900 --> 09:11:42,300
Oh.

10579
09:11:42,680 --> 09:11:44,940
You almost... I almost have... Hold on, I'm a little clumsy.

10580
09:11:47,260 --> 09:11:47,660
Yes!

10581
09:11:53,790 --> 09:11:54,190
Oh.

10582
09:11:56,290 --> 09:11:56,690
Boom!

10583
09:11:59,530 --> 09:12:00,490
You messed it up.

10584
09:12:00,610 --> 09:12:01,230
No, I didn't!

10585
09:12:03,330 --> 09:12:04,570
Oh my God, we're at the eye.

10586
09:12:04,650 --> 09:12:05,590
There it is, the eye!

10587
09:12:07,590 --> 09:12:09,450
The eye of the universe.

10588
09:12:11,010 --> 09:12:12,230
We're seeing it.

10589
09:12:12,370 --> 09:12:12,770
Together.

10590
09:12:19,790 --> 09:12:21,250
Oh, get there faster!?

10591
09:12:21,250 --> 09:12:22,450
No, we're savoring this moment!

10592
09:12:27,640 --> 09:12:28,680
We're on the I...

10593
09:12:29,180 --> 09:12:30,560
It's heavy, I can't do it.

10594
09:12:30,620 --> 09:12:31,100
I can't fly.

10595
09:12:31,420 --> 09:12:32,120
It's too heavy.

10596
09:12:45,730 --> 09:12:46,850
Just a lot of breathing.

10597
09:12:47,750 --> 09:12:48,570
Minx, you're so good.

10598
09:12:48,610 --> 09:12:49,030
Thank you!

10599
09:12:50,150 --> 09:12:52,410
Are you just missing kind of bad here?

10600
09:12:53,270 --> 09:12:54,570
Yeah, this is Minto Gaming.

10601
09:12:59,810 --> 09:13:01,370
Quantum fluctuations everywhere.

10602
09:13:01,570 --> 09:13:02,330
I'm just making sure.

10603
09:13:09,120 --> 09:13:09,840
Look up?

10604
09:13:10,000 --> 09:13:10,500
Oh, sorry.

10605
09:13:10,600 --> 09:13:11,460
I can't do that right now.

10606
09:13:11,680 --> 09:13:12,600
I'm Minto Gaming.

10607
09:13:15,560 --> 09:13:16,580
I'm Minto Gaming.

10608
09:13:18,780 --> 09:13:19,560
It's too dark.

10609
09:13:20,360 --> 09:13:20,840
Quantum!

10610
09:13:21,860 --> 09:13:23,680
Everything is quantum right now.

10611
09:13:24,840 --> 09:13:26,300
This part was so freaky.

10612
09:13:28,600 --> 09:13:29,980
Gamers don't look up.

10613
09:13:30,020 --> 09:13:30,520
Exactly!

10614
09:13:43,680 --> 09:13:44,900
I didn't even flinch.

10615
09:13:45,040 --> 09:13:45,800
I'm so brave.

10616
09:13:58,510 --> 09:13:59,770
I'm so brave!

10617
09:14:05,410 --> 09:14:06,530
No hesitation.

10618
09:14:10,970 --> 09:14:11,930
I'm in the cheese!

10619
09:14:13,230 --> 09:14:14,710
Maybe I wasn't supposed to go in here.

10620
09:14:14,810 --> 09:14:15,010
Hold on.

10621
09:14:15,090 --> 09:14:15,390
I'm leaving.

10622
09:14:19,010 --> 09:14:19,830
No, I was.

10623
09:14:19,870 --> 09:14:21,690
I'm supposed to go up into the space.

10624
09:14:22,730 --> 09:14:23,790
I'm supposed to go up?

10625
09:14:24,070 --> 09:14:25,450
Yeah, I'm supposed to jump into that.

10626
09:14:26,230 --> 09:14:27,350
Into the eye, baby!

10627
09:14:37,840 --> 09:14:40,260
I'm tempted to watch the game and beat it faster.

10628
09:14:40,800 --> 09:14:41,840
Shut the hell up.

10629
09:14:47,110 --> 09:14:48,770
Music is so dramatic.

10630
09:14:52,210 --> 09:14:54,230
Oh, all of them.

10631
09:14:54,630 --> 09:14:56,530
Horn... Hornfels?

10632
09:14:57,170 --> 09:14:58,010
Feldspar?

10633
09:15:01,710 --> 09:15:02,810
Everybody's gone.

10634
09:15:05,350 --> 09:15:06,390
Everything's gone.

10635
09:15:07,190 --> 09:15:08,630
All of our friends.

10636
09:15:10,250 --> 09:15:11,090
Yeah.

10637
09:15:15,700 --> 09:15:17,380
The evolutionist.

10638
09:15:17,380 --> 09:15:17,460
The evolutionist.

10639
09:15:17,460 --> 09:15:18,120
The evolution of Ghost Rider.

10640
09:15:18,260 --> 09:15:19,040
A ghost gamer.

10641
09:15:20,100 --> 09:15:22,320
No, I will credit this person in the description.

10642
09:15:22,560 --> 09:15:22,980
Don't worry.

10643
09:15:26,840 --> 09:15:27,560
Don't worry.

10644
09:15:27,620 --> 09:15:28,240
I'll credit them.

10645
09:15:32,570 --> 09:15:33,530
Text missed.

10646
09:15:40,080 --> 09:15:41,320
There it goes.

10647
09:15:43,200 --> 09:15:44,420
There goes the universe.

10648
09:15:50,450 --> 09:15:51,730
I can hear crickets.

10649
09:15:52,610 --> 09:15:54,630
I don't remember this happening in Interstellar.

10650
09:15:56,450 --> 09:15:58,050
There was a spooky part in this.

10651
09:15:58,150 --> 09:15:58,910
I remember.

10652
09:16:00,110 --> 09:16:01,430
Sorry for the quality.

10653
09:16:01,570 --> 09:16:02,410
The bitrate.

10654
09:16:06,510 --> 09:16:08,810
I remember I got jump scared by a fish here.

10655
09:16:14,140 --> 09:16:15,500
Wow, it's so beautiful.

10656
09:16:16,780 --> 09:16:17,860
Sorry for the bitrate.

10657
09:16:18,280 --> 09:16:18,940
You know.

10658
09:16:21,160 --> 09:16:21,680
Wow.

10659
09:16:21,740 --> 09:16:23,720
Oh, it's dead.

10660
09:16:24,120 --> 09:16:25,620
Wow, another universe.

10661
09:16:25,620 --> 09:16:26,040
Oh.

10662
09:16:26,220 --> 09:16:27,440
Oh, I just destroyed it.

10663
09:16:27,520 --> 09:16:28,020
Oh, my God.

10664
09:16:29,600 --> 09:16:30,060
I'm...

10665
09:16:31,240 --> 09:16:33,500
I am out of control.

10666
09:16:34,040 --> 09:16:35,480
There are people living there.

10667
09:16:35,540 --> 09:16:35,660
No!

10668
09:16:35,920 --> 09:16:36,660
Oh, my God.

10669
09:16:37,180 --> 09:16:38,040
Oh, my God.

10670
09:16:38,060 --> 09:16:39,580
I just can't help but destroy everything.

10671
09:16:39,840 --> 09:16:40,660
I'm a monster.

10672
09:16:44,120 --> 09:16:45,380
What's wrong with me?

10673
09:16:46,020 --> 09:16:47,320
Why am I like this?

10674
09:16:47,980 --> 09:16:50,500
It's because I didn't get enough love.

10675
09:16:51,220 --> 09:16:52,320
And no Elp.

10676
09:16:54,340 --> 09:16:56,280
If I have no Elp, no one can.

10677
09:17:07,400 --> 09:17:07,800
Oh.

10678
09:17:08,220 --> 09:17:09,100
Oh, God.

10679
09:17:09,300 --> 09:17:10,120
I'm not gonna get jump scared.

10680
09:17:10,260 --> 09:17:10,520
Oh, God.

10681
09:17:10,560 --> 09:17:10,760
I'm scared.

10682
09:17:11,320 --> 09:17:11,720
Wait.

10683
09:17:13,960 --> 09:17:15,580
The bitrate is so bad.

10684
09:17:17,800 --> 09:17:18,560
Quantum rock.

10685
09:17:20,380 --> 09:17:20,960
It's gone.

10686
09:17:22,100 --> 09:17:23,200
There was a rock here.

10687
09:17:23,300 --> 09:17:23,900
It's gone now.

10688
09:17:27,720 --> 09:17:31,060
I was a certified elper, but never a spoiler.

10689
09:17:38,620 --> 09:17:40,080
Incoming mouth breather.

10690
09:17:42,460 --> 09:17:43,360
It's me!

10691
09:17:45,980 --> 09:17:49,440
It's you, it's you, it's always you.

10692
09:17:49,920 --> 09:17:51,920
Everything I knew.

10693
09:17:54,640 --> 09:17:55,140
It's me.

10694
09:17:55,340 --> 09:17:56,380
Shoot your scout at him.

10695
09:17:56,600 --> 09:17:57,280
I did that!

10696
09:17:57,400 --> 09:17:58,160
I shot my scout!

10697
09:17:58,520 --> 09:17:59,680
And he turned into a tree.

10698
09:18:08,580 --> 09:18:14,020
And then... it all comes back to marshmallows, huh?

10699
09:18:14,700 --> 09:18:15,960
Wait, is there a fish?

10700
09:18:16,080 --> 09:18:16,360
Please.

10701
09:18:17,080 --> 09:18:19,000
No fish, no fish, no fish, no fish, no fish.

10702
09:18:21,040 --> 09:18:21,440
Ghost.

10703
09:18:22,280 --> 09:18:23,200
Ghost, ghost, ghost.

10704
09:18:25,860 --> 09:18:27,340
I mean, technically, yeah.

10705
09:18:27,620 --> 09:18:29,740
Esker, do you hear music?

10706
09:18:33,700 --> 09:18:35,240
I do really love this ending.

10707
09:18:36,000 --> 09:18:40,520
If it wasn't such a pain in the neck to have gotten to it in this playthrough, I would have done it.

10708
09:18:40,880 --> 09:18:41,580
For sure.

10709
09:18:45,790 --> 09:18:47,650
Stop flashing the... gosh.

10710
09:18:49,810 --> 09:18:50,990
Oh, you have to do that.

10711
09:18:53,270 --> 09:18:53,710
Evangel.

10712
09:18:57,690 --> 09:18:59,250
It's one of the most fulfilling moments.

10713
09:18:59,370 --> 09:19:00,290
It is, it's so good.

10714
09:19:00,770 --> 09:19:02,290
Such a good ending.

10715
09:19:06,950 --> 09:19:08,230
It's not quite time yet.

10716
09:19:08,510 --> 09:19:10,350
Pretty sure you'll need the others for the next part.

10717
09:19:10,670 --> 09:19:11,550
No rush, take your time.

10718
09:19:18,540 --> 09:19:19,760
The quiet shade.

10719
09:19:20,200 --> 09:19:21,200
Oh gosh, is there a fish?

10720
09:19:34,560 --> 09:19:35,800
It's always dark.

10721
09:19:38,820 --> 09:19:39,300
Whoa.

10722
09:19:40,340 --> 09:19:41,180
There he is.

10723
09:19:46,080 --> 09:19:47,980
Does this ending have the prisoner?

10724
09:19:48,100 --> 09:19:48,680
It does, yeah.

10725
09:19:50,880 --> 09:19:51,880
I made sure.

10726
09:19:57,940 --> 09:19:59,620
That bush looks like Shrek.

10727
09:20:07,040 --> 09:20:08,040
That bush looks like Shrek.

10728
09:20:08,040 --> 09:20:08,240
That bush looks like Shrek.

10729
09:20:08,240 --> 09:20:09,040
That bush looks like Shrek.

10730
09:20:09,200 --> 09:20:10,140
That bush looks like Shrek.

10731
09:20:10,140 --> 09:20:10,540
This ending is crazy.

10732
09:20:10,800 --> 09:20:11,460
What are you talking about?

10733
09:20:11,540 --> 09:20:12,060
What am I wrong?

10734
09:20:12,880 --> 09:20:17,060
Oh, because... no, I just didn't want him to flash it so vigorously is all.

10735
09:20:17,200 --> 09:20:18,060
I love this part.

10736
09:20:21,080 --> 09:20:21,560
Whee!

10737
09:20:21,920 --> 09:20:22,400
Whoa.

10738
09:20:24,220 --> 09:20:24,700
Whee!

10739
09:20:33,580 --> 09:20:34,060
Beam.

10740
09:20:34,580 --> 09:20:35,060
Beam.

10741
09:20:35,480 --> 09:20:35,900
Wow!

10742
09:20:47,460 --> 09:20:47,940
Whee!

10743
09:20:48,060 --> 09:20:48,920
We're traveling!

10744
09:20:50,920 --> 09:20:52,140
Oh, this is a video.

10745
09:20:52,300 --> 09:20:52,440
Shh.

10746
09:20:52,520 --> 09:20:52,960
No, it's not.

10747
09:20:53,040 --> 09:20:53,500
It's Minto Gaming.

10748
09:20:58,360 --> 09:20:58,760
Solanum.

10749
09:20:58,760 --> 09:20:59,560
Come here, you.

10750
09:21:00,200 --> 09:21:00,940
My friend.

10751
09:21:02,260 --> 09:21:04,220
I wonder... I'm curious how we get the prisoner.

10752
09:21:27,140 --> 09:21:28,280
I hate that part.

10753
09:21:35,670 --> 09:21:36,830
I hate that part.

10754
09:21:38,230 --> 09:21:39,010
Very brave.

10755
09:21:47,700 --> 09:21:49,000
What is this?

10756
09:21:50,080 --> 09:21:50,940
Is this him?

10757
09:21:53,060 --> 09:21:54,860
How did this become iron lung?

10758
09:21:58,900 --> 09:22:00,640
Is this the stranger?

10759
09:22:13,800 --> 09:22:14,860
Yeah, it's the tree.

10760
09:22:16,500 --> 09:22:17,060
Wow.

10761
09:22:18,280 --> 09:22:18,840
Oh!

10762
09:22:18,940 --> 09:22:19,260
Oh!

10763
09:22:19,940 --> 09:22:20,980
Right here, right here.

10764
09:22:27,100 --> 09:22:28,440
Oh, here we go.

10765
09:22:31,160 --> 09:22:31,760
Oh!

10766
09:22:34,140 --> 09:22:34,740
Oh!

10767
09:22:36,400 --> 09:22:37,000
Oh!

10768
09:22:37,320 --> 09:22:39,120
The ground is opening up.

10769
09:22:41,680 --> 09:22:42,640
So cool!

10770
09:22:44,220 --> 09:22:44,820
Oh!

10771
09:22:45,800 --> 09:22:47,520
It's literally like their coffin.

10772
09:22:54,070 --> 09:22:55,430
Wait, look at the pictures.

10773
09:22:55,670 --> 09:22:55,930
Oh!

10774
09:22:56,050 --> 09:22:56,690
That's me!

10775
09:22:56,950 --> 09:22:58,090
Oh my god!

10776
09:22:58,110 --> 09:22:58,330
Wait!

10777
09:22:59,270 --> 09:23:00,110
That's not me.

10778
09:23:00,110 --> 09:23:00,910
Oh!

10779
09:23:02,230 --> 09:23:02,870
Oh!

10780
09:23:03,990 --> 09:23:05,350
I don't know why.

10781
09:23:11,400 --> 09:23:12,540
There's other candles.

10782
09:23:14,260 --> 09:23:15,720
Oh, they're gone in the pictures.

10783
09:23:16,700 --> 09:23:17,800
Oh, they're gone.

10784
09:23:20,900 --> 09:23:21,580
That's me.

10785
09:23:23,480 --> 09:23:24,720
Extinguishing each species.

10786
09:23:26,220 --> 09:23:28,020
Oh god, don't turn around!

10787
09:23:36,360 --> 09:23:38,020
It's literally a tombstone.

10788
09:23:39,620 --> 09:23:40,880
Connection with Scout is lost.

10789
09:23:46,720 --> 09:23:47,580
There he is!

10790
09:23:47,740 --> 09:23:47,760
Oh!

10791
09:23:49,340 --> 09:23:49,980
You're allowed!

10792
09:23:50,340 --> 09:23:51,180
Come join the party!

10793
09:23:52,860 --> 09:23:57,240
When my kind found the eye and realized what it was capable of, they were terrified.

10794
09:23:57,500 --> 09:23:58,640
It was too difficult a truth.

10795
09:23:58,840 --> 09:24:00,940
Like a light too bright to look upon directly.

10796
09:24:01,120 --> 09:24:01,800
It burned them.

10797
09:24:03,800 --> 09:24:06,460
What they could not unlearn was hidden away in darkness.

10798
09:24:08,020 --> 09:24:08,960
Obfuscated, then lost.

10799
09:24:09,160 --> 09:24:09,220
Oh.

10800
09:24:09,220 --> 09:24:11,020
My kind weren't always like this.

10801
09:24:11,100 --> 09:24:12,060
They weren't always so afraid.

10802
09:24:12,260 --> 09:24:13,840
I did what I could to set things right.

10803
09:24:13,980 --> 09:24:16,140
Yeah, I am still of my kind.

10804
09:24:16,260 --> 09:24:18,120
And you know now what they did.

10805
09:24:18,260 --> 09:24:20,300
I cannot promise our fear won't stay in your mind.

10806
09:24:20,640 --> 09:24:21,540
And so a choice.

10807
09:24:21,720 --> 09:24:23,280
Are you certain you want to remember me?

10808
09:24:25,220 --> 09:24:25,620
Wah!

10809
09:24:25,620 --> 09:24:26,480
Join us!

10810
09:24:28,020 --> 09:24:30,060
I don't want to repeat my kind's mistakes.

10811
09:24:30,360 --> 09:24:32,780
But if you're willing to take the risk, then so be it.

10812
09:24:38,200 --> 09:24:40,520
What if I told him that his journey ended here?

10813
09:24:43,900 --> 09:24:46,180
It would be so sad though to not have him around.

10814
09:24:54,840 --> 09:24:55,500
Everybody's here!

10815
09:24:59,790 --> 09:25:00,770
We've come this far.

10816
09:25:00,850 --> 09:25:01,450
Might as well join.

10817
09:25:01,970 --> 09:25:02,210
Right!

10818
09:25:05,330 --> 09:25:07,330
His song sounds so sad even.

10819
09:25:20,130 --> 09:25:23,510
Church particularly stumps people that never use the signal scope.

10820
09:25:24,130 --> 09:25:25,390
Yeah, I could get that.

10821
09:25:25,730 --> 09:25:27,470
I think it even stumped me for a minute.

10822
09:25:30,930 --> 09:25:31,730
What do you say?

10823
09:25:32,490 --> 09:25:32,890
Harmonica!

10824
09:25:36,030 --> 09:25:39,370
I hadn't dared to hope that anyone would hear the signal for how briefly I set it free.

10825
09:25:39,570 --> 09:25:40,450
Yet here we are.

10826
09:25:40,590 --> 09:25:41,870
Are you ready for the final step?

10827
09:25:42,930 --> 09:25:43,670
Then it's time.

10828
09:25:43,810 --> 09:25:45,790
Time to send our spark out into the darkness.

10829
09:25:50,430 --> 09:25:51,950
Oh, it's so sad!

10830
09:25:56,390 --> 09:26:01,790
It sounds like the thing you use with your hands.

10831
09:26:07,110 --> 09:26:09,670
This song is new to me, but I'm honored to be part of it.

10832
09:26:13,500 --> 09:26:13,900
Theremin!

10833
09:26:14,060 --> 09:26:14,800
Yes, thank you.

10834
09:26:20,680 --> 09:26:21,960
You still have two more people!

10835
09:26:22,120 --> 09:26:22,480
Come on!

10836
09:26:38,350 --> 09:26:39,570
Thanks for the endurance stream.

10837
09:26:39,770 --> 09:26:45,250
This is the best I've been able to understand and follow along with the story because of it being in one stream.

10838
09:26:45,470 --> 09:26:47,030
I wasn't smart enough to beat the base game.

10839
09:26:47,310 --> 09:26:48,230
Oh, thank you!

10840
09:26:49,930 --> 09:26:50,870
Yeah, of course!

10841
09:26:57,210 --> 09:26:59,050
You're creating the new universe!

10842
09:27:05,560 --> 09:27:09,040
What a coward throwing away the marshmallow.

10843
09:27:10,120 --> 09:27:11,180
How dare you!

10844
09:27:29,960 --> 09:27:31,360
I forgot this wasn't you.

10845
09:27:31,440 --> 09:27:31,500
Shh.

10846
09:27:31,620 --> 09:27:32,120
It's okay.

10847
09:27:32,220 --> 09:27:33,120
The immersion, you know?

10848
09:27:33,420 --> 09:27:36,180
I believe we've reached the end of our journey.

10849
09:27:36,380 --> 09:27:37,680
All that remains is to colla- oh.

10850
09:27:38,100 --> 09:27:39,960
Are you ready to learn what comes next?

10851
09:27:40,100 --> 09:27:41,740
I admire your curiosity, my friend.

10852
09:27:43,060 --> 09:27:43,740
How beautiful.

10853
09:27:43,980 --> 09:27:45,240
It's different than I envisioned.

10854
09:27:45,780 --> 09:27:48,780
Whatever happens next, I do not think is to be feared.

10855
09:27:50,080 --> 09:27:51,860
Bran, thank you for the 50 gifted.

10856
09:27:51,880 --> 09:27:52,480
Thank you!

10857
09:27:52,860 --> 09:27:53,260
Oh!

10858
09:27:56,780 --> 09:27:57,180
Oh!

10859
09:28:25,250 --> 09:28:25,730
Yippee!

10860
09:28:33,410 --> 09:28:34,770
Not my eyes!

10861
09:28:34,890 --> 09:28:36,970
We were stuck in darkness for so long, you guys!

10862
09:28:37,230 --> 09:28:38,090
Get used to it!

10863
09:28:42,610 --> 09:28:43,870
There's still so much time.

10864
09:28:45,570 --> 09:28:46,930
I wonder if it's just the credits.

10865
09:28:48,450 --> 09:28:49,410
Outer Wilds...

10866
09:28:55,630 --> 09:28:56,150
Yay!

10867
09:29:08,420 --> 09:29:10,380
Is the thing after the credits also new?

10868
09:29:12,620 --> 09:29:13,880
Such a beautiful game.

10869
09:29:18,180 --> 09:29:19,140
Thoughts on the DLC?

10870
09:29:19,500 --> 09:29:20,800
Oh my god, I loved it.

10871
09:29:23,400 --> 09:29:24,420
Loved it so much.

10872
09:29:24,440 --> 09:29:24,800
Geoffrey!

10873
09:29:25,320 --> 09:29:25,800
Yeah!

10874
09:29:28,420 --> 09:29:29,880
Loved it so much!

10875
09:29:42,680 --> 09:29:45,360
If you stand around the mothership, you can observe the Elks.

10876
09:29:46,280 --> 09:29:46,940
Cloaking device.

10877
09:29:47,300 --> 09:29:47,940
Oh, cool!

10878
09:29:58,140 --> 09:29:59,920
Maybe the ending would be...

10879
09:30:02,360 --> 09:30:03,660
from the DLC.

10880
09:30:03,920 --> 09:30:05,360
I didn't realize it would be...

10881
09:30:05,920 --> 09:30:07,560
I mean, I guess it makes sense, right?

10882
09:30:07,780 --> 09:30:08,220
Because...

10883
09:30:09,140 --> 09:30:11,980
the ending of the game is just the destruction of the universe?

10884
09:30:11,980 --> 09:30:13,320
And the creation of a new one!

10885
09:30:14,020 --> 09:30:14,660
So...

10886
09:30:15,340 --> 09:30:16,540
So cool.

10887
09:30:20,120 --> 09:30:21,180
So awesome.

10888
09:30:21,500 --> 09:30:22,980
I think the DLC...

10889
09:30:26,680 --> 09:30:27,320
added,

10890
09:30:30,540 --> 09:30:31,700
like, such a good...

10891
09:30:33,460 --> 09:30:37,760
like, additional story to the overall plot.

10892
09:30:38,560 --> 09:30:41,760
And I like the way that they told the story differently...

10893
09:30:41,760 --> 09:30:43,620
before, you know, it was all, like, through text.

10894
09:30:43,740 --> 09:30:44,980
And then this time, you have the...

10895
09:30:44,980 --> 09:30:46,300
you had the...

10896
09:30:46,760 --> 09:30:47,200
visual.

10897
09:30:47,500 --> 09:30:50,100
Which, I'm a visual person, so it was much easier for me to...

10898
09:30:50,660 --> 09:30:51,100
understand.

10899
09:30:54,360 --> 09:30:55,240
Yeah, the imagery.

10900
09:30:57,880 --> 09:30:58,760
So good.

10901
09:31:02,880 --> 09:31:04,240
Really adds a whole new story.

10902
09:31:04,500 --> 09:31:06,400
It meshes perfectly with the existing one.

10903
09:31:06,560 --> 09:31:07,160
I know!

10904
09:31:08,540 --> 09:31:09,660
Oh, K'kwa!

10905
09:31:15,810 --> 09:31:16,730
K'kwa!

10906
09:31:16,730 --> 09:31:20,390
Providing another perspective on how people react to their own mortality as well.

10907
09:31:20,450 --> 09:31:24,170
It's connecting the thoughts of how the Nomai found the signal...

10908
09:31:24,170 --> 09:31:25,330
and why it disappeared.

10909
09:31:25,670 --> 09:31:26,170
Yeah, right!

10910
09:31:28,950 --> 09:31:30,690
It was a very, very good...

10911
09:31:30,690 --> 09:31:32,130
very neat tie together.

10912
09:31:32,330 --> 09:31:33,130
Tie it, you know?

10913
09:31:35,430 --> 09:31:35,990
It

10914
09:31:39,660 --> 09:31:40,560
was, uh...

10915
09:31:41,360 --> 09:31:42,020
really awesome.

10916
09:31:42,120 --> 09:31:46,580
I like the contrast between the Nomai and the Stranger's inhabitants.

10917
09:31:47,240 --> 09:31:49,340
The Stranger's were so scary!

10918
09:31:51,280 --> 09:31:53,060
The Nomai were like, We're so chill!

10919
09:31:53,180 --> 09:31:53,460
Oh my gosh!

10920
09:31:54,040 --> 09:31:54,500
Nexi!

10921
09:31:54,720 --> 09:31:55,560
Thank you for the hug!

10922
09:31:56,940 --> 09:31:58,580
It's my favorite game and you did great.

10923
09:31:58,740 --> 09:32:01,840
I was surprised several times by how quickly you solved certain puzzles.

10924
09:32:02,000 --> 09:32:03,720
I agree, the DLC really adds something new.

10925
09:32:04,100 --> 09:32:05,460
Congratulations on finishing it!

10926
09:32:05,580 --> 09:32:06,160
Thank you!

10927
09:32:06,260 --> 09:32:08,560
I think the coolest part is like...

10928
09:32:08,560 --> 09:32:09,380
you know...

10929
09:32:10,480 --> 09:32:11,900
the whole time in the...

10930
09:32:11,900 --> 09:32:14,400
one of my favorite things was the whole time in the...

10931
09:32:15,620 --> 09:32:16,540
original game...

10932
09:32:18,920 --> 09:32:26,460
You had the ability to doze by the fire and then that becomes a key mechanic in the DLC.

10933
09:32:26,560 --> 09:32:27,520
It's just so cool.

10934
09:32:29,400 --> 09:32:30,900
It's just so, so cool.

10935
09:32:41,690 --> 09:32:44,130
All knowledge should be preserved for the future.

10936
09:32:45,970 --> 09:32:47,570
And the Elks were not that.

10937
09:32:47,990 --> 09:32:49,050
The Elks...

10938
09:32:49,630 --> 09:32:50,310
You know...

10939
09:32:50,310 --> 09:32:54,110
Yeah, the Elks saw their demise and were just like, Now we're packing it up.

10940
09:32:54,630 --> 09:32:55,530
Get out of here.

10941
09:32:55,570 --> 09:32:55,730
No.

10942
09:32:55,950 --> 09:32:56,310
No.

10943
09:32:56,390 --> 09:32:57,430
We're not doing this.

10944
09:32:57,530 --> 09:32:58,130
No, no, no!

10945
09:33:00,450 --> 09:33:00,810
So...

10946
09:33:04,700 --> 09:33:08,960
The area that teaches you how to doze by the fire is right next to the radio building where you start the DLC.

10947
09:33:09,140 --> 09:33:09,980
That's so crazy!

10948
09:33:13,220 --> 09:33:13,580
The...

10949
09:33:13,580 --> 09:33:15,180
The Elk were so...

10950
09:33:20,020 --> 09:33:21,680
I feel like they were very...

10951
09:33:22,460 --> 09:33:23,180
realistically written.

10952
09:33:26,730 --> 09:33:28,710
I feel like, you know...

10953
09:33:28,710 --> 09:33:31,250
If a species were to see that...

10954
09:33:31,250 --> 09:33:34,910
And also to leave their home planet and everything...

10955
09:33:34,910 --> 09:33:35,910
I feel like it would...

10956
09:33:35,910 --> 09:33:36,450
You know...

10957
09:33:36,450 --> 09:33:37,930
It feels very...

10958
09:33:38,510 --> 09:33:39,070
Realistic.

10959
09:33:39,690 --> 09:33:40,550
And their...

10960
09:33:40,550 --> 09:33:42,210
Their responses were...

10961
09:33:42,210 --> 09:33:43,150
You know...

10962
09:33:43,710 --> 09:33:44,830
What I would expect.

10963
09:33:45,210 --> 09:33:46,990
Congrats on finishing another amazing journey, man!

10964
09:33:47,070 --> 09:33:47,650
Thank you!

10965
09:33:48,030 --> 09:33:49,050
Thank you, thank you!

10966
09:33:50,290 --> 09:33:52,970
They embodied fear, yet they were the most afraid.

10967
09:33:53,630 --> 09:33:54,870
Thank you for playing Outer Wilds!

10968
09:33:54,870 --> 09:33:55,250
Outer Wilds!

10969
09:33:59,810 --> 09:34:00,490
Owks.

10970
09:34:00,830 --> 09:34:01,970
Super sympathetic.

10971
09:34:02,410 --> 09:34:02,590
Yeah!

10972
09:34:02,950 --> 09:34:03,370
Yeah.

10973
09:34:03,770 --> 09:34:06,670
14.3 billion years later!

10974
09:34:11,330 --> 09:34:13,030
S1-7, thank you for the 10 gifted.

10975
09:34:15,650 --> 09:34:17,770
After Doom 64, will we play Doom 3?

10976
09:34:17,890 --> 09:34:18,510
Probably eventually.

10977
09:34:25,940 --> 09:34:28,780
The creation of a new planet.

10978
09:34:30,400 --> 09:34:32,120
A new creature.

10979
09:34:40,520 --> 09:34:41,180
Yeah!

10980
09:34:41,260 --> 09:34:41,680
Yeah!

10981
09:34:41,680 --> 09:34:42,080
Yeah, campfire!

10982
09:34:42,800 --> 09:34:42,840
Campfire?

10983
09:34:55,480 --> 09:34:56,620
Ohhohhohhmmmm So cool!

10984
09:34:58,140 --> 09:35:00,600
I did meet again somehow...

10985
09:35:01,500 --> 09:35:02,660
Okay, ignore that.

10986
09:35:02,920 --> 09:35:04,320
Thank you to...

10987
09:35:05,040 --> 09:35:05,700
Humphutterus.

10988
09:35:06,440 --> 09:35:07,600
For your...

10989
09:35:07,600 --> 09:35:10,100
For your full play-through of the ending.

10990
09:35:10,420 --> 09:35:11,360
I appreciate it.

10991
09:35:12,920 --> 09:35:14,180
Thank you so much.

10992
09:35:17,140 --> 09:35:18,400
Soma by Malaaved.

10993
09:35:18,400 --> 09:35:18,820
Let's have them survive!

10994
09:35:19,000 --> 09:35:19,280
Let's go!

10995
09:35:19,440 --> 09:35:19,640
Yeah!

10996
09:35:20,800 --> 09:35:22,320
Why are they so scary?

10997
09:35:23,240 --> 09:35:25,320
Don't judge a book by its cover!

10998
09:35:28,440 --> 09:35:30,720
Okay, I'm just gonna quit to the main menu then.

10999
09:35:32,840 --> 09:35:34,900
Oh, my controller disconnected.

11000
09:35:43,080 --> 09:35:45,060
Yippee and congrats on finishing the journey, Minto!

11001
09:35:45,700 --> 09:35:46,440
Thank you!

11002
09:35:52,720 --> 09:35:53,680
What's the video?

11003
09:35:55,840 --> 09:35:56,660
Just the ending.

11004
09:35:57,000 --> 09:35:59,300
I would have imagined the whole thing was a video.

11005
09:36:01,580 --> 09:36:03,480
Imagine if I just was like...

11006
09:36:03,480 --> 09:36:04,860
By the way, guys, get got.

11007
09:36:06,540 --> 09:36:07,480
Oh, I'm fine.

11008
09:36:10,340 --> 09:36:13,280
But I really would have done the ending if it...

11009
09:36:13,280 --> 09:36:15,860
wouldn't take like another...

11010
09:36:16,340 --> 09:36:17,020
I don't know...

11011
09:36:17,020 --> 09:36:18,840
crazy amount of time for me.

11012
09:36:19,280 --> 09:36:22,480
Because I would have to go to so many places and get so much more stuff.

11013
09:36:25,120 --> 09:36:26,140
I wish I...

11014
09:36:26,140 --> 09:36:27,380
I wish I had played...

11015
09:36:27,400 --> 09:36:28,580
I wish I had played on my original game.

11016
09:36:30,840 --> 09:36:32,400
I wish I had played my original game.

11017
09:36:35,320 --> 09:36:35,720
But...

11018
09:36:36,120 --> 09:36:36,640
That's okay.

11019
09:36:36,920 --> 09:36:39,560
I still wouldn't have remembered how to get there or do anything.

11020
09:36:45,600 --> 09:36:46,440
But that's okay.

11021
09:36:50,380 --> 09:36:51,140
But that's okay.

11022
09:36:51,280 --> 09:36:51,540
That's okay.

11023
09:36:53,800 --> 09:36:55,060
That's my mistake.

11024
09:36:55,060 --> 09:36:57,180
I thought I could just...

11025
09:36:57,180 --> 09:37:00,060
You know, I thought with what I got before...

11026
09:37:00,640 --> 09:37:01,080
And...

11027
09:37:05,200 --> 09:37:05,640
And...

11028
09:37:05,640 --> 09:37:07,640
You know, I thought it would have been...

11029
09:37:07,640 --> 09:37:08,500
I thought it would have been different.

11030
09:37:08,680 --> 09:37:09,260
Hard to know.

11031
09:37:09,420 --> 09:37:11,500
Yeah, pretty much, so...

11032
09:37:12,900 --> 09:37:15,520
Look up the new Giants deep easter egg for giggles.

11033
09:37:16,320 --> 09:37:19,680
Someone said that there was a Steins Gate easter egg, is that true?

11034
09:37:20,300 --> 09:37:20,740
Is that true?

11035
09:37:22,960 --> 09:37:23,980
Is that true?

11036
09:37:26,800 --> 09:37:35,020
Thank you guys for joining me for this... I didn't expect it to be so spooky!

11037
09:37:35,860 --> 09:37:37,360
I may have added one.

11038
09:37:39,980 --> 09:37:40,860
Where is it?

11039
09:37:41,920 --> 09:37:42,620
Giant's Deep?

11040
09:38:00,040 --> 09:38:00,860
Easter egg.

11041
09:38:01,020 --> 09:38:07,060
I can now go to the Outer Wilds Wiki and look without any fear.

11042
09:38:12,750 --> 09:38:14,650
I can now look with no fear.

11043
09:38:19,410 --> 09:38:23,490
I'm seeing... I don't see it under the Easter eggs.

11044
09:38:23,710 --> 09:38:25,110
Uh oh, someone's slacking.

11045
09:38:27,790 --> 09:38:28,790
Wasn't that added?

11046
09:38:35,660 --> 09:38:36,780
It's a new one.

11047
09:38:41,580 --> 09:38:43,440
Time to join the Outer Wilds.

11048
09:38:43,640 --> 09:38:43,640
I'm sick.

11049
09:38:43,780 --> 09:38:44,520
I was just going...

11050
09:38:45,520 --> 09:38:46,620
It's really new.

11051
09:38:46,700 --> 09:38:47,780
Wait, how new are we talking?

11052
09:38:48,140 --> 09:38:50,480
Hold on, let me go to the... I'm going to the...

11053
09:38:51,640 --> 09:38:52,560
store page.

11054
09:38:54,340 --> 09:38:57,000
Sorry, you can hear probably the video.

11055
09:38:58,660 --> 09:38:59,240
Wait.

11056
09:39:00,640 --> 09:39:01,660
Thank you, Gao!

11057
09:39:02,160 --> 09:39:02,700
GG!

11058
09:39:03,160 --> 09:39:03,740
GG!

11059
09:39:03,900 --> 09:39:04,180
GG!

11060
09:39:07,260 --> 09:39:10,560
I just noticed the achievement I got...

11061
09:39:11,120 --> 09:39:15,920
from... from getting killed by the pursuers called OOFAUCHMABONES.

11062
09:39:16,940 --> 09:39:17,960
Brad, thank you!

11063
09:39:18,200 --> 09:39:18,640
Wait.

11064
09:39:18,760 --> 09:39:19,060
Oh!

11065
09:39:19,340 --> 09:39:20,400
Mr. Gyura, thank you!

11066
09:39:20,640 --> 09:39:21,240
Oh my gosh.

11067
09:39:21,980 --> 09:39:22,880
Wait, hold on.

11068
09:39:23,460 --> 09:39:24,460
Thank you, Mr. Gyura!

11069
09:39:25,300 --> 09:39:27,760
I see the Elk Owls is the opposite of the Nomai.

11070
09:39:27,800 --> 09:39:31,500
Instead of pressing forward and facing danger, they regress and hit in the past.

11071
09:39:31,560 --> 09:39:34,920
The DLC has a core message about fear and overcoming it to make progress.

11072
09:39:35,120 --> 09:39:38,240
Which is what you had to do as a player too.

11073
09:39:38,480 --> 09:39:39,800
Oh my gosh, so deep.

11074
09:39:42,780 --> 09:39:43,180
OOFAUCHMABONES.

11075
09:39:43,820 --> 09:39:46,420
Brad, I think it might take a while before your things come up.

11076
09:39:46,500 --> 09:39:46,920
So thank you!

11077
09:39:47,060 --> 09:39:48,220
Congrats on finishing Echoes.

11078
09:39:48,220 --> 09:39:48,640
It was a blast.

11079
09:39:48,820 --> 09:39:50,940
This and Doom really cheered me up these past two weeks.

11080
09:39:51,060 --> 09:39:51,900
Thanks for picking it up.

11081
09:39:51,920 --> 09:39:52,520
You really cooked.

11082
09:39:52,700 --> 09:39:55,680
I can't believe I... I can't believe you guys said you have to cook.

11083
09:39:55,840 --> 09:39:57,260
And it was to cook!

11084
09:39:57,480 --> 09:39:59,060
It was to... I actually had to cook!

11085
09:40:00,720 --> 09:40:02,440
I had to cook to be cooked.

11086
09:40:06,820 --> 09:40:09,060
You guys are secret geniuses maybe too.

11087
09:40:11,180 --> 09:40:13,940
You guys are maybe secret geniuses as well.

11088
09:40:14,200 --> 09:40:15,980
To uh...

11089
09:40:15,980 --> 09:40:19,100
To suggest that.

11090
09:40:26,220 --> 09:40:28,660
10 hour stream.

11091
09:40:33,180 --> 09:40:35,580
Just a bit of help.

11092
09:40:41,140 --> 09:40:42,380
It's almost 1am.

11093
09:40:42,640 --> 09:40:45,860
I have to take my cat to the vet at 8am.

11094
09:40:47,780 --> 09:40:48,820
I need to shower.

11095
09:40:49,320 --> 09:40:50,100
Brain cooked.

11096
09:40:50,240 --> 09:40:51,280
My brain is cooked.

11097
09:40:52,960 --> 09:40:53,720
And then...

11098
09:40:53,720 --> 09:40:57,140
I think tomorrow... I don't know how long Doom will take me.

11099
09:40:58,620 --> 09:41:01,500
But I'm on a bit of a time limit since I have something to do that night.

11100
09:41:03,360 --> 09:41:04,560
And uh...

11101
09:41:06,120 --> 09:41:07,320
And then...

11102
09:41:07,320 --> 09:41:08,400
Saturday.

11103
09:41:08,740 --> 09:41:09,520
Metal Gear.

11104
09:41:13,140 --> 09:41:14,660
Probably like 10 minutes trust.

11105
09:41:14,720 --> 09:41:16,760
Actually I watched a DeSino video.

11106
09:41:17,540 --> 09:41:18,740
I was like...

11107
09:41:19,400 --> 09:41:22,260
I watched a DeSino video about the BFG.

11108
09:41:23,640 --> 09:41:25,600
Which I've watched him before.

11109
09:41:25,760 --> 09:41:27,580
So if you're familiar with him.

11110
09:41:27,600 --> 09:41:28,360
That guy does like...

11111
09:41:28,360 --> 09:41:29,520
A bunch of...

11112
09:41:29,520 --> 09:41:31,400
A bunch of uh...

11113
09:41:31,400 --> 09:41:31,480
Uh...

11114
09:41:31,480 --> 09:41:33,520
Doom videos and stuff.

11115
09:41:35,300 --> 09:41:35,820
Um...

11116
09:41:36,440 --> 09:41:37,280
Goodnight men.

11117
09:41:37,400 --> 09:41:37,960
Goodnight everybody!

11118
09:41:38,240 --> 09:41:38,860
Thank you!

11119
09:41:38,920 --> 09:41:39,640
If you're heading out.

11120
09:41:42,140 --> 09:41:42,660
Um...

11121
09:41:43,560 --> 09:41:44,080
But...

11122
09:41:44,080 --> 09:41:45,780
I still don't understand the BFG.

11123
09:41:46,040 --> 09:41:47,920
Like I understand it but I don't understand it.

11124
09:41:47,980 --> 09:41:49,820
So I actually have no idea what to do tomorrow.

11125
09:41:50,300 --> 09:41:52,240
Probably will watch another uh...

11126
09:41:52,240 --> 09:41:53,140
Or watch a...

11127
09:41:53,140 --> 09:41:54,140
Like a...

11128
09:41:54,820 --> 09:41:55,520
What's it called?

11129
09:41:56,860 --> 09:41:57,380
A...

11130
09:41:58,520 --> 09:42:00,060
Play through and see what they do.

11131
09:42:03,080 --> 09:42:04,080
Have a great night!

11132
09:42:04,260 --> 09:42:05,020
You guys as well!

11133
09:42:05,380 --> 09:42:06,100
You guys as well!

11134
09:42:06,400 --> 09:42:06,820
Hold on.

11135
09:42:06,940 --> 09:42:08,400
I kinda wanna keep listening to this.

11136
09:42:08,640 --> 09:42:09,680
Congrats and Goodnight men.

11137
09:42:09,760 --> 09:42:10,160
Thank you!

11138
09:42:10,340 --> 09:42:10,900
Hold on.

11139
09:42:11,300 --> 09:42:11,880
Sorry guys.

11140
09:42:12,160 --> 09:42:12,700
Gimme a second.

11141
09:42:13,280 --> 09:42:14,080
Gimme a second.

11142
09:42:14,180 --> 09:42:14,680
Gimme a second.

11143
09:42:15,680 --> 09:42:16,100
You're a...

11144
09:42:16,100 --> 09:42:16,820
Oh!

11145
09:42:16,960 --> 09:42:17,780
There it is!

11146
09:42:18,100 --> 09:42:18,420
I think.

11147
09:42:19,260 --> 09:42:19,820
I think.

11148
09:42:20,200 --> 09:42:20,920
Gimme a second.

11149
09:42:21,100 --> 09:42:21,480
One second.

11150
09:42:21,720 --> 09:42:22,480
Blah blah blah blah.

11151
09:42:22,880 --> 09:42:24,280
Thank you for all the superchats.

11152
09:42:24,280 --> 09:42:25,180
Thank you for...

11153
09:42:25,960 --> 09:42:26,360
Um...

11154
09:42:26,360 --> 09:42:27,300
All the doughnos!

11155
09:42:27,320 --> 09:42:27,600
Really.

11156
09:42:27,720 --> 09:42:28,020
Really...

11157
09:42:28,020 --> 09:42:28,220
Really...

11158
09:42:28,220 --> 09:42:28,480
Really.

11159
09:42:28,480 --> 09:42:28,800
Really.

11160
09:42:28,980 --> 09:42:29,020
Really.

11161
09:42:29,020 --> 09:42:31,220
Really, really, really, really, really, really, really appreciate it.

11162
09:42:31,360 --> 09:42:32,860
Thank you for the non-elp-elp.

11163
09:42:33,260 --> 09:42:33,820
Here we go.

11164
09:42:39,020 --> 09:42:39,380
Okay.

11165
09:42:40,740 --> 09:42:41,100
Um...

11166
09:42:41,940 --> 09:42:43,180
There's more to the Easter egg.

11167
09:42:45,400 --> 09:42:46,400
I have to look it up.

11168
09:42:48,020 --> 09:42:49,000
I have to look it up.

11169
09:42:49,060 --> 09:42:50,140
Thank you for the Endurance stream.

11170
09:42:50,220 --> 09:42:51,280
Thank you guys for...

11171
09:42:51,760 --> 09:42:57,780
If you watched it all day, or if you joined in the middle, or even if you just joined now, or even if you just watched at the very beginning.

11172
09:42:58,560 --> 09:42:59,600
I hope you guys had fun.

11173
09:42:59,600 --> 09:43:00,640
Sorry for the...

11174
09:43:00,640 --> 09:43:03,400
Sorry for my frustration in the middle.

11175
09:43:03,540 --> 09:43:03,820
But...

11176
09:43:05,180 --> 09:43:06,140
We persevered.

11177
09:43:06,900 --> 09:43:09,300
We persevered and we made it.

11178
09:43:09,880 --> 09:43:11,500
I skipped work for this?

11179
09:43:11,680 --> 09:43:12,300
No way.

11180
09:43:15,980 --> 09:43:17,960
I'm glad you got to play through the DLC.

11181
09:43:18,020 --> 09:43:18,740
Thanks for streaming it.

11182
09:43:18,800 --> 09:43:19,280
Thank you!

11183
09:43:21,380 --> 09:43:22,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

11184
09:43:24,680 --> 09:43:25,160
Okay.

11185
09:43:30,560 --> 09:43:31,580
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

11186
09:43:31,700 --> 09:43:33,280
And I suggest you guys as well!

11187
09:43:35,340 --> 09:43:37,200
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

11188
09:43:37,440 --> 09:43:38,900
I have karaoke in the morning.

11189
09:43:40,240 --> 09:43:40,640
Morning?

11190
09:43:42,240 --> 09:43:43,580
I don't... Afternoon?

11191
09:43:44,880 --> 09:43:45,660
And um...

11192
09:43:45,660 --> 09:43:45,920
Yeah!

11193
09:43:47,940 --> 09:43:48,340
Excited.

11194
09:43:48,460 --> 09:43:51,740
I'll do karaoke for a little bit, and then I'll make a waiting room for Doom.

11195
09:43:51,880 --> 09:43:54,100
I don't know how long I'll do for karaoke.

11196
09:43:54,560 --> 09:43:56,720
As soon as I'm done, I'll make a waiting room for Doom.

11197
09:43:57,300 --> 09:43:58,300
And uh... Yeah.

11198
09:44:00,660 --> 09:44:01,060
Okay!

11199
09:44:01,280 --> 09:44:03,860
Thank you for the stream!

11200
09:44:04,200 --> 09:44:04,700
Thank you!

11201
09:44:04,820 --> 09:44:07,940
Thanks for letting me do the ending.

11202
09:44:08,260 --> 09:44:09,580
By just watching it.

11203
09:44:12,240 --> 09:44:14,520
I know some people are like, It doesn't feel the same.

11204
09:44:15,800 --> 09:44:17,800
Like I said, I've already done it before.

11205
09:44:18,220 --> 09:44:18,560
So...

11206
09:44:19,660 --> 09:44:21,420
You know, I'm not gonna get that feeling back.

11207
09:44:22,180 --> 09:44:22,800
Or whatever.

11208
09:44:23,520 --> 09:44:23,820
Okay.

11209
09:44:23,940 --> 09:44:25,400
I'm gonna quit stalling.

11210
09:44:25,440 --> 09:44:26,300
Thank you for the...

11211
09:44:27,000 --> 09:44:28,120
Thank you for the super chat.

11212
09:44:28,240 --> 09:44:28,680
What did it say?

11213
09:44:29,600 --> 09:44:31,680
Endurance stream with the Oshii was not to love.

11214
09:44:31,820 --> 09:44:32,320
Oh...

11215
09:44:33,380 --> 09:44:33,660
Okay.

11216
09:44:35,220 --> 09:44:36,240
Thank you everybody!

11217
09:44:37,320 --> 09:44:38,780
Have a good night!

11218
09:44:39,060 --> 09:44:40,940
See you guys tomorrow!

11219
09:44:42,200 --> 09:44:42,740
Bye bye!

11220
09:44:43,040 --> 09:44:43,800
Bye bye!

11221
09:44:43,880 --> 09:44:44,340
Bye bye!

11222
09:44:44,440 --> 09:44:45,280
Bye bye!

11223
09:44:48,040 --> 09:44:48,620
Bye bye!

11224
09:44:49,140 --> 09:44:51,300
I told

11225
09:45:28,380 --> 09:45:29,380
you I wouldn't do it today!

11226
09:45:29,720 --> 09:45:30,520
I said so!

11227
09:45:31,900 --> 09:45:32,460
Woo!

11228
09:45:32,460 --> 09:45:32,640
Woo!

11229
09:45:34,420 --> 09:45:34,820
Yippee!

11230
09:45:34,820 --> 09:45:37,100
Oh my gosh,

11231
09:45:46,690 --> 09:45:47,650
you're gonna like it so much.

11232
09:45:47,730 --> 09:45:48,010
They're crazy.

11233
09:45:49,250 --> 09:45:50,290
Thanks for dropping by.

11234
09:45:50,350 --> 09:45:50,970
I appreciate it.

11235
09:45:51,150 --> 09:45:51,670
Okay, bye!
