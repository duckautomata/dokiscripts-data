00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Hello Mint, it's Major Zero.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,200
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,460
Major Zero.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,420
Your mission is to infiltrate MGS Con 3, loyalty to the con.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,060
It's not going to be in a hotel basement anymore.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,460
This is a real convention centre, a completely different
jungle.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,140
Panels, artist alley, and even a gaming room.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,720
There's a lot of ground to cover, but first we need you to
lead the charge for the digital convention attendees,

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,220
keeping them company.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,560
The fate of the digital stream is in your hands.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,180
The world is watching you.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,700
I accept, but only if we can do a parody of the Metal Gear
Solid 3 opening.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Done.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,880
The plane's outside.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,840
Since the beginning, the convention was split into two,
in-person and digital.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,580
This marked the era known as MGSCon.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,640
A con without borders in a physical and digital space.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,050
Ontario, California for this mission, Mint.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,010
There are over 1,000 people attending this in person this
year and even more watching online.

20
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,470
Throw that thing away, we're over the drop site.

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,390
This is MGS Comm 3, a special event among MGS fans.

22
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,630
Please try to make the most of it.

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,610
This is one for the history books.

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,070
The first Ghost Halo jump.

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,610
Godspeed, spread your wisps and fly.

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,510
Oh, yippee!
