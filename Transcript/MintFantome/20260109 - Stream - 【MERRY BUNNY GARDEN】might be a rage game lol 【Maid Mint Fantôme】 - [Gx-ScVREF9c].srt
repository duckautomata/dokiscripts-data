full screen it You should full screen it Oh my gosh you guys

22
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:33,380
Right before the stream Kira messaged me about my upcoming
3D Jazz a concert which um there will be streaming tickets

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:47,300
can we have a bite of the donut oh sorry i already ate it

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,040
saying kiwawa is she here kiwawa i don't see her

25
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,580
I said Kiara.

26
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,520
Wait, what did I say?

27
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,320
Wait.

28
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,340
I mentioned her.

29
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,200
Oh, wait.

30
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,140
Maybe I meant Kiara.

31
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,780
Oh, I said Kiara, not Kiara, you guys.

32
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,520
I said Kiara, not Kiara.

33
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,860
Kiara is of Oshi Spark.

34
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:37,050
Kira of Oshi Spark messaged me a the jazz club and they had
a question okay this might this I guess will spoil one of

35
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:50,250
the songs but that's okay because maybe it's a given but I
they asked about the song can't say goodbye to yesterday

36
00:06:50,250 --> 00:07:01,290
which I have a cover out actually of that song on my channel
it's from Metal Gear Solid 2 and the the They asked because,

37
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,590
you know, it's going to be a live band.

38
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,390
And so they were like asking about doing a different
rendition of it.

39
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,730
Like, because the song is very long.

40
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,190
Maybe you're cutting it down a little bit.

41
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,890
And but but sorry.

42
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,490
Oh, whoops.

43
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,970
I clicked out of the game on accident.

44
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:28,050
The the the the the the the band member that asked was like,
Hi, I was asking about the song.

45
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,050
Can't say goodbye to yesterday.

46
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,230
sung by the lovely Carla White.

47
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,050
And, because yeah, Carla White sung the original.

48
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:48,930
And then the band member said, I worked with her in New York
in the 70s and 80s and they never knew about the song.

49
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,490
Isn't that crazy?

50
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,070
Like what a tiny small world.

51
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,050
Isn't that so cool?

52
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,150
I was like, wow.

53
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:10,430
Like, oh my gosh, I can't believe that they found out, found
a piece of work of hers that they never knew about.

54
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,790
And but they worked with her before.

55
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,730
Video games.

56
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,170
Video games connect, connect everybody.

57
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,630
That's so cool.

58
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,610
I was like, whoa.

59
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,210
Now I want to pick their brain about her though.

60
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,130
Now that also makes me feel more nervous.

61
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:40,850
I hope I do the song justice so that they're like, ah, it's
like she's back.

62
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,030
Being there live to hear you sing that song would have been
my year.

63
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:55,390
Well, it will still be live and I will hopefully have more
opportunities to sing it live too, so.

64
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,390
You'll do fine.

65
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:13,690
I'll do my best But now I have to Practice a different
version of the song So More homework for me But yeah Welcome

66
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:25,310
to Mary Mary Bunny Garden So I thought I would have my cat
ears on But then I was like I wonder If that would be kind

67
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,810
of intimidating to the bunny girls You know what I mean?

68
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:45,070
Because know cats can hunt bunnies I'm on the prowl I'm on
the prowl for some bunny girl maybe I should but I thought

69
00:09:45,070 --> 00:10:03,870
being a bunny girl would be cuter anyway I got big old
floppy ears I like I like the big old ears and um and Uh...

70
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,530
I'm not as...

71
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,210
Well...

72
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,650
Um...

73
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:17,030
Have you had to listen to Uma Umah cover of Bokura Not yet,
I haven't listened to any of the cover songs yet, the Love

74
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,850
Life cover songs?

75
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,430
Intimidating meow there?

76
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,210
Meow!

77
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,430
Meow meow meow meow meow Wait, I can't be a cat, I'm a bunny
so I go...

78
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,230
Wait, don't bunnies kind of squeak sometimes?

79
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,440
And then my nose goes...

80
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,000
And I...

81
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
And I...

82
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,440
And I...

83
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,900
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

84
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,280
Which I do not have many, maybe as much bounce as some of
the lovely ladies behind me, but I can... Actually, no!

85
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,260
You know what?

86
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,640
That's not true!

87
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,300
I've got... I've got all your bounce right there!

88
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,860
You see that?

89
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,060
You see that?

90
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
You see that?

91
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,280
Look at that bounce, look at that bounce, look at that, look
at them go, look at them go, look at them break down, break

92
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,500
down, break.

93
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,080
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce,
bounce.

94
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,560
Look at them go, look at them go, look at them go.

95
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,760
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

96
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Look at that guy.

97
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,160
Actually, if I take off my jacket.

98
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,680
Bounce, bounce.

99
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Oh, well...

100
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,670
Bounce.

101
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,880
Okay, I'm embarrassed.

102
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,120
It's fine.

103
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,940
It's okay, because...

104
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,300
Well, you're not looking at my bounce anyway.

105
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,720
You're looking at the bunny girls, so it's totally...

106
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,340
Okay!

107
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,400
Best part about Minto her bounce and wiggles.

108
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,270
That one guy should not full screen the stream on the plane.

109
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,410
Is that me as Heisenberg?

110
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,070
Is your profile picture me as Walter Heisenberg White?

111
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:33,210
I mean, your pop-out already said you have literally no
bounce parameters.

112
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,010
But there's seriously something going on there.

113
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,910
You convinced me to choose Boston Cream instead of vanilla
dip.

114
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,230
Let's go!

115
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,710
Today's my birthday, I turned 34 today, and I'm enjoying
myself a yummy triple chocolate cake right now.

116
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,830
Abraham, happy birthday!

117
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,170
Happy birthday to you!

118
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,810
Airflow.

119
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:08,570
Guys, I'm on season five episode I think I just finished
episode 10.

120
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,970
Season five of Breaking Bad.

121
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,570
I am just a few, I am six episodes away from finishing the
series.

122
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,830
And then I can move on to the movie and then I can move on
to Better Call Saul.

123
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,510
I accidentally nicked my head shaving again.

124
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,370
Not too bad.

125
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,750
And now I'm feeling sad.

126
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,870
Can I get a healing?

127
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,890
Healing girl.

128
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,750
Beep.

129
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,950
Wow, just like Walter did.

130
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,510
He did that too in the show.

131
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,780
Better Call Saul is even better.

132
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,560
That's what I've heard.

133
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,280
That Better Call Saul is like one of the greatest TV shows
of all time.

134
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,940
And I also didn't, I thought originally that the show,
because I've heard so many good things about it, Mito makes

135
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,200
my heart bounce.

136
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,120
Because I heard so many good things about it, and I feel
like for so long, I thought it was a show that came out

137
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:17,480
immediately following Breaking Bad, but I didn't realize it
came out in like 2022, so, so excited to see this vibe

138
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,640
getting demonetized.

139
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah, yeah, I'm expecting that.

140
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,540
Yeah, pretty recent.

141
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,780
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,020
So I'm very excited because...

143
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,300
Hi, Donkey Minto.

144
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,460
Don't call me a donkey.

145
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,240
Oh, it finished in 2022.

146
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,580
Oh, the Netflix lied to me.

147
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,740
But, um...

148
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,440
My favorite characters are Mike and Saul anyway, so I'm very
excited about a show about them.

149
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,660
So...

150
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,240
I'll never forgive you, Walter White.

151
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,480
I'll never forgive you.

152
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,740
Mike having his, like, this is good, isn't it moment.

153
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,400
Oh, I'm so...

154
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,980
I was seething.

155
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,760
I cried.

156
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,920
I cried, and I, like, was so angry.

157
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,720
I, like, had to take a walk.

158
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,400
I was so...

159
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,160
I was so bad.

160
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,180
I was...

161
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,120
I was...

162
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,720
Anyway, we're not talking about Breaking Bad today, though.

163
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,320
But I think I'm going to have to, like...

164
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,760
I think what I'm going to do is watch the last three
episodes.

165
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,080
So 14, 15, 16.

166
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,300
Do like a little watch-along.

167
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,740
But since I'm almost there...

168
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I need to like...

169
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,760
Wait.

170
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,460
I need to like...

171
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,940
Maybe do it before stream.

172
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,360
in one of these days or something.

173
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,460
Sorry, hi, umma, minto-um-me- No!

174
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,800
No, I'm a bunny!

175
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,160
Actually, I think I used these for umma ears before.

176
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,900
They don't- they- I mean, they do look like umma ears, don't
they?

177
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,160
A little bit!

178
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,580
Not the size of the boy and it's the girl they're attached
to.

179
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,600
Exactly.

180
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:41,720
Ho-Shell Spoiler Cast But today we're playing Merry Bunny
Garden Which might be a rage game This is not the Bunny

181
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:50,500
Garden original So in this game we are directing these Three
lovely ladies home As they stumble through Akihabara Because

182
00:16:50,500 --> 00:17:00,980
they are drunken messes No half measures, Minky Give the
Bunny Girls your full measures My Oshi, the donkey.

183
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,580
I'm not a donkey.

184
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm not a donkey.

185
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,020
They're gonna take Akiba.

186
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,860
So true.

187
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,960
I think they're drunk.

188
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,560
Oh, customer information.

189
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,540
Bunny Garden is a social place for later...

190
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, okay.

191
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,680
Is it on auto?

192
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,420
Takizo, thank you so much for the podcast.

193
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,440
They're like, you've played this game, before.

194
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,640
You don't need to.

195
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:35,840
I think they're already drunk.

196
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,200
Prepared us for gentlemen to heal their daily fatigue.

197
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,240
Bunny Garden.

198
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,220
And gentle ladies.

199
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,320
Yeah, I'm here too.

200
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm a gentle lady.

201
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,220
I'm a gentle lady.

202
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,900
My name is Kana.

203
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,080
One of the cast members here.

204
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,400
Let's have a lot of fun together today.

205
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,100
Who got her like this?

206
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,140
I'll take the girl in the bottom right.

207
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,920
Not for sale, not for sale!

208
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,860
Daki, thanks for the gift!

209
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,360
Hey, so welcome to Mamu's ship, Darkroo.

210
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,660
I love disasters.

211
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,360
What does that mean?

212
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,360
Kana, why are you talking to an empty city?

213
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,360
She's hallucinating?

214
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,300
Wait, or the bar is haunted?

215
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,860
Kana, why are you talking to an empty city?

216
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,660
The store has been long closed and it's just us here.

217
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,040
I think she's...

218
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,840
I think it's haunted?

219
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,360
Me?

220
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,140
Ah!

221
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,120
Okay, when I played Bunny Garden, I remember Rin being my
favorite.

222
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,440
So if she also loves ghosts, she's gonna take care of me!

223
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,660
We don't have that!

224
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,760
It's been so long since I've been taken care of.

225
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,160
Oh, I think she's attacking me.

226
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,840
Oh, really?

227
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Even better.

228
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,580
We need a dead body boat.

229
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
No, we need a dead body boat.

230
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,820
I'm just, I'm just a bit.

231
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm too much.

232
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm just a bit on a bit on.

233
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,580
No, she drank too much today.

234
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,060
We're all wobbly.

235
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,640
Wobbly, wobbly, wobbly.

236
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:38,740
Bellow.

237
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,460
Oh!

238
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,900
Oh, boy, bellow.

239
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,000
No, Kamisama, please.

240
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,840
The godlight.

241
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Please, disappear.

242
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,520
No!

243
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,460
Wobbly boobs.

244
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,180
You can't flash your boobs!

245
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,320
The store is closed.

246
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,500
Why are they still there?

247
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,180
Why are they still there?

248
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,100
My beloon.

249
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,780
Mint didn't get the 18 plus patch.

250
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,440
I don't think that exists for this game.

251
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,520
Watching your streams during a tattoo session, I think this
game is...

252
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,240
Destroying my tattoo artist!

253
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,800
This is made by Cynran Kagura people.

254
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,300
No, this is Q-rate.

255
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,380
My wobblies.

256
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,900
My wobbl- I'm gonna start referring to them as that.

257
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,640
My wobblies, even though they don't wobble so much.

258
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,260
Kana has already seen the wobblies.

259
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,620
I just felt like dancing.

260
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,600
What does this mean?

261
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,320
What's happening?

262
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,580
Do you always get naked when you dance?

263
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,360
Why is she crying now?

264
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,600
What's happening?

265
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,500
Why are you crying?

266
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:14,900
Because...

267
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,720
Even though you saw Rin's wobblies kind of won't look at
mine.

268
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,360
Oh no, she's like white girl wasting.

269
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,060
That's why you got all sad and teary.

270
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,140
I'm real sorry.

271
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,780
They're there.

272
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,700
That's on me.

273
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,840
Come here, Miuka-chan.

274
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,830
Come here, Miuka-chan, I'll treat you like a good girl.

275
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:49,850
Come, come.

276
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,450
Mama.

277
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,470
Mama?

278
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,250
I'm looking forward to it.

279
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,230
That's when you guys are wobbling around.

280
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,610
I'm like, hey, wobblies.

281
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,850
Kya, kya, kya!

282
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,970
Yip!

283
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:23,050
They switched characters.

284
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,950
Miyuka is the motherly one.

285
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,690
This isn't right, this isn't okay.

286
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,410
But even I want to be spoiled sometimes.

287
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,610
I want to be spoiled all the time.

288
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,470
Why are we on the CG for so long?

289
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,090
Even Miyuka has days when she wants to be pampered.

290
00:22:53,610 --> 00:23:08,070
You can be as spoiled as you want.

291
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,630
You guys would spoil me, right?

292
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,070
Momi, momi.

293
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,170
Momi, momi.

294
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,370
Oh, squeeze.

295
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,150
Where did she squeeze it?

296
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:25,390
Oh, I didn't give you permission to fondle me!

297
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,650
Kha-kha!

298
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,970
Kha-kha!

299
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,610
No, sorry, I'm just a mid.

300
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,790
The music is so...

301
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,910
This is the peppermint club.

302
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:45,270
Kana, what's wrong?

303
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,930
Kana, what's wrong?

304
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,550
I'm gonna be you also want to be pampered.

305
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,910
Shows got to be pampered.

306
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,230
Shows to be nice.

307
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,710
All right, Kana, I'll pamper you too.

308
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,310
All right, Kana, I'll pamper you too.

309
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,590
Dekchune!

310
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,150
Dekchune!

311
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,610
Eekchune!

312
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,530
What the heck are we doing?

313
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,550
That's cruel.

314
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,770
Don't just wake up on Nero and all of a sudden.

315
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,550
I wish I could crawl into a hole.

316
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,110
She's gaining sentience, you guys.

317
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,390
Don't you have like other staff that work here that can like
escort Yuhu?

318
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,850
So we should call a taxi?

319
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,610
No, no.

320
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,410
Can we call a taxi?

321
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,550
No.

322
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,110
No, no.

323
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:21,970
No, no, no.

324
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,470
No, no, no.

325
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,890
No, no, no, no, no.

326
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,490
I'm going to violently throw up, she's so Oh, she always
causes trouble by getting sick in the car.

327
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,210
I'm going to violently throw up.

328
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,410
She's so honest.

329
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,250
The road home is full of dangers.

330
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,250
What are their bears?

331
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,610
Oh, it is Japan.

332
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,670
Sly.

333
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,310
Yeah, there could be slimes or goblins.

334
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,070
I don't have the confidence to get home safely.

335
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,010
I'm scared.

336
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,230
I'm scared, Kuna.

337
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:19,530
Nin-chan.

338
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:20,950
Gyo!

339
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:21,870
Ah!

340
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,430
Ah!

341
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:24,790
Ah!

342
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,750
I...

343
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,250
...tuck.

344
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,430
Oh, she hugged her.

345
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,150
...

346
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,210
...

347
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,050
...my princess.

348
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:35,570
...

349
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,210
...

350
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:36,990
...

351
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,310
...

352
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,240
She couldn't have said that any slower.

353
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,800
A little spell to get home safely.

354
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,440
That got her good.

355
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,140
That got her good.

356
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,920
Their body's getting high.

357
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:33,640
I thought you guys were sobering up unless this is how they
normally talk to each other my honey

358
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,740

Wait!

362
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, she was gonna throw.

363
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,080
Oh, she was gonna throw.

364
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,460
Should I, should I throw?

365
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,420
I'm gonna throw up.

366
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,460
I always want someone to massage my booty.

367
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,520
Oh, yeah, everybody, drink some water.

368
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,340
I feel so sick.

369
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,100
I think I'm going to...

370
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,400
I think I'm going to flower.

371
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,220
No, I'm just kidding.

372
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,360
Let's get home safely and meet here again with a smile.

373
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,200
Me

374
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,460
and again with a smile.

375
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,180
I'm glad they're so proud.

376
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,420
about the workplace.

377
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,360
They're so big.

378
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:39,620
I think that was my one issue with the game is there's no
variety in the Opie size of the girls.

379
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,480
They all have the same...

380
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,920
Maybe it's like you have to be this big to ride this ride.

381
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,320
You know?

382
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,460
You have to...

383
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,680
Oh, I looked into the bunny garden it closed.

384
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,240
Oh, that's the achievement I got?

385
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,560
It's kind of...

386
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,860
On the screen, you can select a character to go home.

387
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,020
Other than Kanam, more characters will unlock as you
progress through several episodes.

388
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,260
Let's start by sending Kanam!

389
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,840
Alright, guys.

390
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,040
Okay, we have to get through one...

391
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,740
Stage one, two of Kanas stage.

392
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,760
What other costumes do we have?

393
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,300
Flower garden.

394
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,260
Wait, post switch?

395
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,180
Post switch?

396
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,640
Post switch?

397
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,500
Post switch?

398
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,400
Post switch?

399
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,400
Post switch?

400
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,200
Post switch?

401
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,600
Post switch?

402
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,880
Breeze?

403
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,520
Wait, this is what she's wearing, don't all?

404
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,070
Hey!

405
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,170
Hey!

406
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,510
I'm being lied to right now!

407
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,890
I'm being lied to!

408
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,910
This is a cute face though, this one.

409
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,830
Oh wait, why can't you see my... hold on.

410
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,190
I can't you see my cursor.

411
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,770
There we go.

412
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,670
This is a good face.

413
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,390
Do you have some censorship setting on?

414
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,930
I don't think so, I don't think.

415
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,990
I don't think...

416
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,090
Stockings!

417
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,370
Ooh, I like the socks too though.

418
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,990
We'll go with the stockings.

419
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,110
Okay.

420
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:41,710
Select an episode.

421
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,730
Streaming sensor.

422
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,070
I don't have that.

423
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,070
We'll see what happens if something, if it is the same in
the future, then I will.

424
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,230
I will check it out.

425
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,250
stage on the screen.

426
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,490
Choose a difficulty.

427
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,290
Wasted.

428
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,630
Clearing the stage, the next stage will be unlocked.

429
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,210
If you beat a stage with a high score, a secret seed will be
unlocked.

430
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,710
Okay.

431
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,670
Sweet size and hot skin.

432
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,530
Alright, we're just getting home.

433
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,270
I don't know.

434
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,330
Let's go for the normal mode.

435
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:21,630
Wait.

436
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,330
What if we do wasted?

437
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,350
Wasted.

438
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,530
Let's try wasted.

439
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,470
I want to see what's of highest difficulty.

440
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,780
Wait, Rin looks so cute in her casual clothes.

441
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,380
Oh,

442
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,540
she's got the chance.

443
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
She's so clumsy.

444
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,340
She's just gotta go home like that.

445
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah.

446
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,290
Let's walk part way home together today.

447
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,510
I'll be there to protect you.

448
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,030
That's not me, that's a utility pole!

449
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,050
Oh, sorry, Rin-chan.

450
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,630
Oh, wait, are they in front of you DX right now?

451
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:56,310
Is this the area of- behind would be the former is a former
Gundam cafe and now it's a what's that what's that uh

452
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:03,470
Tamashi store and then over here would be the station and
then this is this looks like it's supposed to be UDX right

453
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,310
here oh I think so

454
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:19,170
I know we're both drugged but it's a shock to be mistaken
for utility pole.

455
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,570
Ikimbi Cafe!

456
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,450
I only got to go once.

457
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,670
Wait, why are they all the way over here?

458
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,310
Because I know where the Bunny Garden location is.

459
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,670
It's not close to here at all.

460
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,310
It's like all the way down here.

461
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,090
Or no, all the way over there.

462
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:47,550
Sorry.

463
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,650
Huh.

464
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,410
Hmm.

465
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,030
Why are they all the way over here?

466
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,930
Look at...

467
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,230
Try touching my body.

468
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,150
It's not hard like a utility pole.

469
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,090
It's soft and squishy, right?

470
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,690
It's so much and squishy, right?

471
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,030
It's really good.

472
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,250
Rin, you're so squishy and feel great to touch.

473
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,730
I'm pretty squishy, too, because...

474
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,790
Ectoplasm, but...

475
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,730
Pony, pony.

476
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,590
Pony, pony.

477
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,530
You're getting naughty.

478
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,250
You're getting naughty.

479
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,130
I wonder if you get a different dog

480
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,290
log if you choose tipsy over wasted.

481
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,950
What place is jiggly?

482
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,250
Can you imagine?

483
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:13,770
I imagine my cursor as like me standing like like I'm
standing over there witnessing all of this behind them and

484
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,570
I'm like just watching You know, just kind of like...

485
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,510
We can't do this outside.

486
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,650
I'm gonna go to auto, though, so I don't have to...

487
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,570
I'm over there like...

488
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,890
They were roommates.

489
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,610
drunk roommates.

490
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,830

491
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,000

492
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,900
Her body is rising.

493
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,280
Oh my god.

494
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,380
You know, I think around this hour there's definitely still
people walking around.

495
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,460
You know,

496
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,120

Kana...

502
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,440

507
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,340

508
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,700
...

509
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:08,860
...

510
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,260
...

511
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,800
I don't know if you're so cute.

512
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,840
I mean, they're so cute.

513
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,340
I love you.

514
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,500
I love you too.

Thank you.

517
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,460
But it's a little bit too.

518
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,440
I'm not going to do that.

519
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,540
Oh, I'm going to do it.

520
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,020
I promise you.

521
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,540
I'm going to make it a promise.

522
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,760
Oh.

523
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,240
Oh.

524
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,440
They're so cute!

525
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,460
It's not in public, right?

526
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,500
Or maybe?

527
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,380
Or maybe.

528
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,640
Bunny Garden Thruple?

529
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,320
Yeah, aren't I supposed to be like a customer?

530
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,920
Am I just like watching from the distance?

531
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,540
Isn't that the original game is I'm the customer?

532
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,120
And I'm just like standing here like...

533
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,540
Oh, I'm a ghost!

534
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,300
That's a ghost from the bar!

535
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,500
Yeah, say it clearly, Nin-chan.

536
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,900
Watching from the chair.

537
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,500
That's okay too.

538
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,700
Why is she having her say this?

539
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,460
I would die!

540
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,820
I'm already dead!

541
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,640
I would die!

542
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,270
She's teasing her too much.

543
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,610
Just finished your MGS4 finale VOD.

544
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,170
What an ending.

545
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,150
Is this game similar?

546
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,170
Maybe.

547
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,090
Oh wait, it's time to actually play the game.

548
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:20,610
Oh my gosh.

549
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,870
When a cast member is drunk, they won't be able to walk
properly.

550
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,870
Control them well and get them home safely.

551
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,950
But in order for a cast...

552
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:32,070
In order to move a cast member forward, you need to increase
the drunk gauge.

553
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,550
Heat?

554
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:41,090
When a gauge is half full, you can press the direction
change buttons alternatively to advance forward.

555
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:48,390
As the drunk gauge gets more full, the cast member's
movements will be harder to control, so make sure to balance

556
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,590
well and move forward.

557
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,530
Oh, okay, wait.

558
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,270
Right rotation.

559
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,210
Oh my god.

560
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,190
Oh my god.

561
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:00,750
Oh my god.

562
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,350
Oh my god.

563
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:01,870
Oh my god.

564
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,650
Wait, there's panties over there guys.

565
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,670
Okay, okay.

566
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,870
Okay, okay.

567
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:11,450
Obstacles.

568
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,690
If your health drops to zero, you won't be able to return
home.

569
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,790
Okay, okay, we gotta get a good score though, right?

570
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:18,970
Okay.

571
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,670
What's W?

572
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,670
Increase gauge?

573
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,710
Ah, ah!

574
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,270
We turn around!

575
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,710
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around!

576
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,490
Turn around!

577
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,050
will have many panties.

578
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,370
The more you pick up, the higher your score will be, so make
sure to grab as many as you can.

579
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,190
By clearing the stage after picking up panties, you will be
able to wear them.

580
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:36,850
Oh, nice.

581
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,750
Ah, okay.

582
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,350
Uh, what is it, like, left rotation?

583
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,390
Uh, okay.

584
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,110
Keep going.

585
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,370
Keep going.

586
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,090
Keep going.

587
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:46,570
Keep going.

588
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,370
Keep going.

589
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:47,810
Keep going.

590
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,590
Oh, no, no, no.

591
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:50,730
Oh, gosh.

592
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,690
Wait, no, no.

593
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,110
Please, walk.

594
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,690
Uh, okay, okay.

595
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:57,930
Okay.

596
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,350
Okay, demde...

597
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:07,010
Okay We're fine Everything's okay Okay, we're fine.

598
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,010
Everything's alright.

599
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,710
I'm a professional.

600
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,870
This is wasted.

601
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,350
Oh wait, she's turning around for some reason.

602
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,150
Increase the gauge, increase the gauge.

603
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,770
Oh my god, oh my god!

604
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,030
You're okay, you're okay!

605
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,210
You're okay, you're okay!

606
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,270
You're okay, you're okay!

607
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,270
Wait!

608
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,870
Oh, shoot.

609
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,330
It's okay.

610
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:31,990
We're fine.

611
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,210
Turn this way.

612
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,390
Go this way.

613
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,270
No, she's just walking in circles, you guys.

614
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,270
What do I do?

615
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,150
Wait, but I want the rainbow panties!

616
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,430
Let's try this.

617
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,790
Maybe if I do this way.

618
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,670
Okay, here we go.

619
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,030
Ouch!

620
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:51,490
Ouch!

621
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:52,010
Ouch!

622
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:52,370
Ouch!

623
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:52,510
Ouch!

624
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:52,590
Ouch!

625
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,790
Ouch!

626
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,870
Ouch!

627
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:53,730
Wait!

628
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,530
Oh no!

629
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,630
Everything is bad!

630
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,790
Oh my god!

631
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,530
Oh my god!

632
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,610
Trouble?

633
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,750
What do you mean trouble?

634
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,270
I'm so thirsty, I can't move anymore.

635
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:37,490
Why didn't you do that earlier then?

636
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,440
I like how she's drooling.

637
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:00,010
What happens if you get caught drunk carrying six pairs of
underwear you found?

638
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,570
Yeah, whose underwear is this?

639
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:05,780
Oh, good job.

640
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,310
Good job, Kana.

641
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,310
Good job.

642
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,080
She narrates everything just like Alan Wake.

643
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,820
She says everything that she's doing exactly like him.

644
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,760
She says everything that she's doing exactly like him.

645
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:32,320
Yeah.

646
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,800
Alan's just really drunk.

647
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:46,500
Oh, drinking water after alcohol is vital.

648
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,760
Hold the button down to make sure the cast members drink
plenty of water within the time limit.

649
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,940
Wait, is this a second?

650
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,420
If you give them too much water at once, they'll choke.

651
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,100
So make sure to consider resting when drinking.

652
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,900
When the gauge is filled up, you will clear the game.

653
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,260
I'm gonna waterboard her?

654
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,530
Alan has the thermos.

655
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,910
Kana has the pantsu.

656
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,610
Alright, how do I give her water?

657
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,130
Drink!

658
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:27,910
Oh.

659
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,750
Two, one!

660
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:32,610
Drink.

661
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,430
Oh, she's choking, she's choking.

662
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:47,290
You need this- It is- The water!

663
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,270
Oh, she- She's choking!

664
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:50,870
Sorry.

665
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,190
Ben!

666
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,150
Oh, she- Why are you so bad at drinking water?

667
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,130
Oh.

668
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,810
Sorry, my bad.

669
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:05,510
I didn't...

670
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,410
This is a jump.

671
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,810
Wait.

672
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:11,970
She died!

673
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:14,870
I'm a baby.

674
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,190
This is my first day on Earth and I've never had water
before.

675
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,270
Please understand.

676
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,770
You guys don't...

677
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,170
When you are drinking the water, you're not like...

678
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,990
She was actually was doing her best cat role play.

679
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:35,290
You know?

680
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,330
Obviously!

681
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,530
You might say she has a drinking problem.

682
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,650
Yeah!

683
00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:00,410
I want to become a shining, a star shining on the silver
screen and television.

684
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,070
That's been an important dream to me ever since I was a
child.

685
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:28,290
someday I'll make it I'll make it in that world the world
will the world filled with sparkle wait what I didn't expect

686
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:34,450
this game to have like a storyline I thought it was gonna be
completely different from the original game and just me

687
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,710
walking around, you're wrong.

688
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,610
I never imagined that my dream would come true in such a
way.

689
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,230
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

690
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:43,910
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

691
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:50,490
I'm by the police!

692
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,720
No!

693
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,020
Suspect the crime hidden in a newspaper.

694
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,320
Oh, my God.

695
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,060
Inside Akiba's dark alleys.

696
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:11,820
Wait,

697
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,120
her like, drug voice is so cute.

698
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,760
Wait, her like, drug voice is so cute.

699
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,340
Bani Garden?

700
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,480
Also, didn't she leave in her uniform?

701
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,560
So like, she's gonna have nothing to wear next day.

702
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,300
This is great advertising!

703
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,400
What's a tea game?

704
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,660
The sensor on her eyes.

705
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,520
Oh, twister.

706
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,220
Oh, twister.

707
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:09,600
Oh.

708
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,720
T-game is twister.

709
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,380
Is this place legal?

710
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,130
Save that for later.

711
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,780
What do you?

712
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:41,560
...

713
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:41,760
...

714
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,120
...

715
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,840
...

716
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,060
...

717
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,240
...

718
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,260
Her dream came true!

719
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,120
This is what we call infamy.

720
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,580
Bad end!

721
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,680
Wait, I have to retry!

722
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,540
Oh my gosh, wait, saw the bad end.

723
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,360
Wait, okay, hold on, we can do this.

724
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:19,840
Oh!

725
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,060
Okay, if I...

726
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,300
If I get the bad end, okay, she gets arrested.

727
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,840
Okay, drink the water.

728
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,540
Oh, I just realized that you have a timer.

729
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,100
Okay.

730
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,440
We're fine.

731
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:40,720
We're fine.

732
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,240
We're good!

733
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,500
Did she finish?

734
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,380
Mizuwa, how is she?

735
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,840
To clear the round, you have to...

736
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,340
You have to do the mini-game.

737
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,120
She choked a little bit.

738
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,140
It's okay.

739
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,800
Kana night routine has been unlocked.

740
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,820

741
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,700

Nice.

744
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,140
Not the wild zebra.

745
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,600
Oh, my princess green.

746
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,620
Wait, those are cute!

747
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,300
Flower garden orange.

748
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,920
Oh, butterfly rose purple.

749
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,620
Those are in fancy.

750
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,000
Can't see.

751
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,100
Flower garden blue?

752
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:37,720
Oh!

753
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:38,520
Whoa!

754
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,720
Love lovely pink!

755
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,500
Ultra rare.

756
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,320
Lucky bonus.

757
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,340
Pure elegant.

758
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,900
Polka dot!

759
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,340
Yeah!

760
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,400
Wait, where's my shima pan?

761
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,800
Panties collector is the achievement I just got.

762
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,040
Wait, where were you this whole time, Rin?

763
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,120
What's her camo index?

764
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,260
I mean the shima pan!

765
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:17,580
Maybe they're Ocha, Ocha, Ocha, Ocha, O-Double these double,
triple, quadruple, infinity, duple, rare because they're the

766
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,300
bestest ones.

767
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,760
Momi, Momi.

768
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,620
Momi, Momi, Momi.

769
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,380
Momi, Momi.

770
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,680
What are we rubbing?

771
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,940
R-Ri, Ri-chan!

772
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:31,660
Yes?

773
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,340
Oh.

774
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:33,660
Oh!

775
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,040
Okay,

776
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,880
so watch it on the plane.

777
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,440
Why are you rubbing my boobs?

778
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,720
You guys are going to learn a lot of Japanese from this
game.

779
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,680
Like a Momi-Momi.

780
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:02,420
Like a Momi-Momi.

781
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,480
I mean, I'm not going to do anything, right?

782
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,120
Because, you know, that's all.

783
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,260
Momi-Momi, Momi, Momi, Momi, Momi, Momi, Momi, Momi, Momi.

784
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,460
What?

785
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:23,640
What?

786
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,220
Why she said that about the snacks?

787
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,720
Why did she say that?

788
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,270
Just two girls on the streets of Akiyabawa.

789
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,180
Being silly.

790
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,020
It's my birthday, Julia's happy!

791
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:47,560
Birthday!

792
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,460
I really hope work isn't monitoring what I'm watching on
their Wi-Fi.

793
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,000
Yeah,

794
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,920
me too.

795
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,740
That's my reaction too.

796
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,980
She doesn't like it.

797
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,960
Maybe she probably likes it.

798
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,760
So now they're Now they've both done this to each other.

799
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,300
Now they've both done this!

800
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,320
Is this what happens at the Ghostmates Cafe?

801
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,780
No!

802
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,780
It's just me, so...

803
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,260
I have nobody...

804
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,260
I have nobody to grab.

805
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,320
Go ahead!

806
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,940
I wanna walk.

807
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,160
I almost want to walk by them and be like, get a room.

808
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,940
No, they're just girlies being girlies.

809
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,740
They're so cute.

810
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,500
Oh, it's just a game?

811
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,180
It's just a game?

812
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,760
It's just for fun.

813
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,280
It is pretty fun.

814
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,900
Wait, so it has a deeper meaning.

815
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:38,150
Uh-oh.

816
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,030
Uh-oh.

817
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:41,510
No,

818
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,780
I think everybody is understanding the situation very...

819
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,920
Very clearly.

820
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,860
What do you mean by that?

821
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,520
What do you mean make me quiet?

822
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:00,940
With your lips?

823
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,760
I thought the OGU game was risky.

824
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,840
This is wild.

825
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,500
They're really going for it.

826
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:27,380
Docky, docky, docky, docky, docky, docky, docky, docky,
docky, docky.

827
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,480
It's a famous line from the anime.

828
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:48,100
All she said was, I should say was, I should go back to the
next.

829
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,480
You're going to say that and then leave.

830
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
I think she realized.

831
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,580
It's so dramatic.

832
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,720
Imagine just seeing all of that.

833
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,560
A moment of relaxation.

834
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:17,170
But I have to beat night one, or night one, stage two.

835
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,150
To get to Kan, or to get to Rin.

836
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,190
With night routine.

837
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,730
We're going home, we got this.

838
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,790
Tadaiima!

839
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,190
Wawa-chin, I'm back.

840
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,710
Who's a Wawa-chin?

841
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:34,570
Kiwawa?

842
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,630
Oh, thank you.

843
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,500
Kiwawa?

844
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,160
Kiwawa and again?

845
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,160
Her pet dog.

846
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,580
Uh oh.

847
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,500
We gotta go out.

848
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,520
Are you going to like a convenience?

849
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:56,140
Kiwawa again.

850
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,400

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,020
Yeah, she's like a dog.

852
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,180
Okay.

853
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,220
Wait, I'm not the dog.

854
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,860
Wait, so...

855
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,760
Are we going back outside?

856
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,720
We're home!

857
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,280
We're home!

858
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,100
We like that we're still in our uniform, we haven't changed
at all.

01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,120
Doesn't she kind of look like Nimmy with like her hair and
stuff?

904
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:23,060
The alcohol is completely worn off.

905
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:23,780
Oh, good.

906
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,060
Oh, good.

907
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,220
Oh, wait.

908
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:31,760
How do I help?

909
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,560
Oh, nice.

910
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,600
That's a lot of steam, you guys.

911
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,280
Good, she's getting nice and sudsy.

912
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,760
Kana shares a voice actor with Maya's top gun from Uma
Musume.

913
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,340
Make of that what you will.

914
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,880
Wait, really?

915
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,760
Things I can't relate to.

916
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,540
Unless it's like my tummy.

917
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,220
Oh,

918
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:28,200
kind of!

919
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,600
You know, actually my hands are built-in rulers.

920
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:37,600
You know, I could totally, I could totally check that out
for you.

921
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,420
She's also an OZomi from BA.

922
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,840
Oh my gosh.

923
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,180
Yeah,

924
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,840
that's the other girls' fault.

925
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,680
Yeah, that's the other girls' fault.

926
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,320
What is this?

927
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,840
What is this like self?

928
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,180
What is this conversation she's having with this monologue?

929
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:10,980
What is she?

930
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,720
It's like, yeah, they touch my boobs when they get drunk,
but I also touch their boobs when they get drunk.

931
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,960
Are their boobs getting bigger because of me?

932
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,900
My friend sent that to me.

933
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:26,940
Oh, whoops.

934
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,580
I didn't mean to click it, sorry.

935
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:45,900
My friend sent me a thing the other day, she was just like,
no, she did not say hot dog, but she said, she said, um, she

936
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:55,300
said that, or so she sent me a, a, it's like a massage
parlor, but it's meant for, it's in Japan, it's meant for

937
01:04:55,300 --> 01:05:00,300
girls to, who want their, their, their chests to be bigger.

938
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,500
She always would complain to me and she would be like, I
want my chest to be bigger!

939
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:08,920
And...

940
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,500
So she sent this to me and she's like, I'm gonna go to it
next time.

941
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,740
Does it work?

942
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:17,940
I don't know.

943
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,720
It sounds like a scam.

944
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,780
But you're getting a massage, so...

945
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,820
I guess it would feel nice at least.

946
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,440
Right?

947
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,320
Maybe.

948
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:51,480
well it's her money so sound she can do whatever she wants
wait hold on let me see what it was hold on let me see what

949
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,060

01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:10,160
she said she said I'm interested and I said you should and
she said I mean massage by pretty ladies and boobers get one

951
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:19,820
bow win-win even if it doesn't work it could be a good a
breast cancer checkup I don't think they'll be looking for

952
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:31,300
that Minto there's a dojinchi about that I'm sure it's
called tiara well on let's see but it's kind of expensive I

953
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:41,460
feel oh wait this is for one month or and they even show the
results and i'm like they show like a girl she can't fill

954
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:50,160
out her bra and this is before and then after she can fill
out the bra so i don't know i feel how else would you do

955
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,440
that otherwise it's the same bra

956
01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:07,110
are you sure she didn't get confused by the dojin she title
no this is the one it's real it's on hot pepper beauty so So

957
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,650
it's gotta be real.

958
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:16,830
Tiara, the boob massage place, parlor.

959
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:21,290
Anyway.

960
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,410
Sounds legit.

961
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:29,550
I know, and if you're getting massaged by a pretty lady,
then I mean, I understand my friend.

962
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:30,710
Yeah.

963
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,570
Does everyone prefer them baker?

964
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:39,770
I say,

965
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,570
any size is a prize.

966
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,750
I'm losing it to Boobers get womboed.

967
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,130
That's what she said.

968
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:54,710
Skincare!

969
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,670
Oh, yeah.

970
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,890
I do every day.

971
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:07,530
I also got a new skincare set.

972
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,250
Oh my gosh, it came in the mail!

973
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,910
Don't let them massage your feet.

974
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,210
Will my feet get bigger?

975
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,050
That is justice.

976
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,150
I take so too.

977
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:28,590

01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:55,710
I think we're gonna have another mini game everybody.

979
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,670
Focus on your face.

980
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:21,610
I've helped people with like skincare routine.

981
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:31,250
So if you're like, you know, if you're like, oh my gosh, I'm
afraid of being given like a seven step care routine that

982
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:37,830
I'm never gonna remember how to do anything with don't you
worry I know how to make them also very simple so you know

the toner and milky gauge are maxed out.

986
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,470
After the gauge is maxed out, press the button to fire!

987
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:14,570
Launch the toner and milk toner.

988
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:17,370
Why are we launching two toners?

989
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:25,950
But there is, but milky toner is like a thing, so um...

990

991
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:56,280

It's skincare!

997
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:06,220
We knew exactly what was gonna happen, but...

998
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,440
Sludgeier?

999
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:19,940
Eww!

1000
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:25,100
Push-ups and massage can increase blood flow temporarily to
make things bigger.

1001
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,860
By guys, I have arn-gym pumps.

1002
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,480
Arn-gym pumps.

1003
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:40,140
Okay, time for the sleeping mini-gim.

1004
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,800
Oh, yes, me!

1005
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,700
I love that Min loves this.

1006
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,580
I love it too.

1007
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,000
Everyone, 07, this body is surviving.

1008
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:51,600
It will!

1009
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,340
It's fine!

1010
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:54,360
It's fine!

1011
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,500
Can you confirm that that's the proper way to...

1012
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,700
Well, okay, well...

1013
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,340
It's not incorrect.

1014
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,340
You do gotta get it on there.

1015
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,660
I've been doing my Korean skincare wrong the whole time.

1016
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,720
I've let down my home country.

1017
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,340
I know, we should all take lessons from Mary Bunny Garden.

1018
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,420
Clearly.

1019
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,540
We walk with a bounce and step has been unlocked.

1020
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:22,680
Ring gaming!

1021
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,460
Yippee!

1022
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,240
What is this one, though?

1023
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,360
A moment of relaxation.

1024
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,020
I'm scared.

1025
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,840
I'm scared.

1026
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:31,500
I'm scared.

1027
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:31,940
I'm scared.

1028
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,360
Rip Vod.

1029
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,100
Will this be in the skincare tutorial?

1030
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,200
But you know, now that I think about it, a lot of my
skincare is kind of like white like that, you know, or like

1031
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,480
kind of...

1032
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,940
Like that consistency.

1033
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,520
I like to watch skincare videos every now and then too.

1034
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:53,320
Oh yeah!

1035
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,440
Like actual ones.

1036
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,140
Yeah.

1037
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:57,940
Me too.

1038
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,240
review skincare.

1039
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,320
Let's finish this Kano one.

1040
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,240
Oh, bonus episode.

1041
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:06,940
That's what this is.

1042
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:09,900
Fine.

1043
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:10,640
Oh.

1044
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,420
What is here?

1045
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,740
Are they censoring the crack?

1046
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,060
I can't even...

1047
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:32,410
I think her shorts are down.

1048
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:33,350
Yeah, but they're not so...

1049
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:38,090
It's literally just her booty crack right there.

1050
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,590
Girl must be a plumber.

1051
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,680
It's really bright in her room, you know?

1052
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,480
Oh, just kidding.

1053
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,080
It's night time?

1054
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,360
Yeah, the peace!

1055
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:00,360
The peace!

1056
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,720
Beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches.

1057
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,640
Beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches.

1058
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,280
It's okay, you can fall asleep, kinda.

1059
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,280
It's okay!

1060
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,900
Oh, Wawa is a cat!

1061
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,440
Not a dog.

1062
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:20,140
Maybe?

1063
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,680
Or it's a dog that uses a litter box?

1064
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,600
These pajamas are so cute, I wish I could see more of them.

1065
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,660
There has to be an uncensored version.

1066
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,540
Maybe it's like a bonus CD or something.

1067
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:35,780
Right!

1068
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,720
Or a human.

1069
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,580
Yeah, a human trained to use a litter box.

1070
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:46,100
And then a cat trained to use the toilet.

1071
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:49,920
It's in the settings.

1072
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,680
I checked though, I checked the...

1073
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,540
I checked... I clicked off sensitivity mode, so...

1074
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,820
I'm not in streaming mode.

1075
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,540
I clicked... I already changed it.

1076
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,160
I don't think it would detect the OB errors.

1077
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,600
The uncensored version is on the L side.

1078
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,380
Oh wait, really?

1079
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,980
I don't think it's R18 though.

1080
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:19,780
This is not enough to be... I could see a part of her...

1081
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,900
The top.

1082
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:23,380
I don't think it's... I think they're just... I don't know.

1083
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,960
What is it?

1084
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,380
This girl is a yapper.

1085
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,400
She should stream.

1086
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,620
Just a little bit, huh?

1087
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,640
She's... Oh.

1088
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,620
She's chilling?

1089
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:48,540
Ah?

1090
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,800
Uri-yari-kuchi-miru-no?

1091
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,100
Aw, it's not.

1092
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,580
Sensitive mode options is the opposite of what you think it
does.

1093
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,620
Wait, so I turned it on on accident?

1094
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:04,640
Oh, no!

1095
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,180
Oh, no!

1096
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:09,480
Oh, yeah.

1097
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,920
She's talking about the manju everybody.

1098
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,160
Yummy, yummy.

1099
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:29,000
I thought it was gonna be like one of those roll, like the
roll sushi or something.

1100
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:30,380
You know?

1101
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,560
Red.

1102
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,550
Oh, anko!

1103
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:41,950
Red bean paste.

1104
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,470
Oh, yummy.

1105
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,890
Oh, that's like such a...

1106
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,350
I think that's like a difficult thing to translate.

1107
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,470
Because like in the Japanese, it would say like...

1108
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:59,070
Like she's, you know, making a sexy noise.

1109
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:02,570
But in English, they have to translate it to red.

1110
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:03,990
So it doesn't really make any sense.

1111
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,550
Because anko is red bean.

1112
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,050
So it's like kind of funny.

1113
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,870
You have the chance to write your...

1114
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:19,100
Me too, I love RARs.

1115
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,580
I love RARs.

1116
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:26,220
What could be the minigame here?

1117
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:28,520
Oh,

1118
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,760
we touch them.

1119
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,820
Imagine sleeping next to her.

1120
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,360
She would just say the whole...

1121
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:53,800
Everything.

1122
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,540
She would have a whole conversation in her sleep.

1123
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,320
You would be like...

1124
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,380
Do you think you could...

1125
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,620
She was just yapping.

1126
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,660
So she's dreaming about food and also...

1127
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:33,540
And

1128
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:40,330
also...

1129
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:42,270
Also about her cat, probably.

1130
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:45,270
Right.

1131
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,410
Or...

1132
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:54,670
She's pretending she's a cat and is saying, you can touch my
tail.

1133
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:57,670
Because it's a special players.

1134
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:01,430
Oh!

1135
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,230
Oh!

1136
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:16,070
Oh!

1137
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:19,650
Maybe she's dreaming of Mito.

1138
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:24,730
A bunny girl does dream of ghost maid.

1139
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:29,190
Not so

1140
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:33,060
rough.

1141
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:34,880
It's her tail.

1142
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,740
It's got...

1143
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,660
Or her bunny ears or something.

1144
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:38,900
It's gotta be.

1145
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,760
It's gotta be.

1146
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:44,200
It's gotta be like she's pretending she's a carrot.

1147
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,520
Or she's...

1148
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,820
It's gotta be.

1149
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,820
It's gotta be.

1150
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,600
Ears.

1151
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,980
No, too sensitive.

1152
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,100
Too sensitive.

1153
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,540
Ears are too sensitive.

1154
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,120
But like about like, but the bunny ear.

1155
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:03,900
Not actual ear.

1156
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:06,440
Ah!

1157
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,280
See, I told you!

1158
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,260
I called it.

1159
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,620
I called it!

1160
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:18,320
I like

1161
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,310
her pajamas very much though.

1162
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:29,290
They're very cute.

1163
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:35,470
It reminds me of a bunny character that I actually like and
I own some stuff with the bunny character.

1164
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:42,150
And then I went to a place and they were selling, they had a
collaboration with that artist and the bunny character.

1165
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,370
And I was really excited.

1166
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:48,830
Except the pajamas were like over a hundred dollars.

1167
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:52,110
So I didn't get them.

1168
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:59,030
Kind of the type of person to read out the whole B-movie
script in her sleep.

1169
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,050
So true!

1170
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:04,610
Unicode clam?

1171
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:04,950
No.

1172
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,010
Different.

1173
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,420
I think she wants to touch fluffy tail.

1174
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,740
They were really nice quality, but...

1175
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,240
Bushi touch.

1176
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,980
Something that is hard but squishy.

1177
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,480
I still think it's a tail.

1178
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,000
Wait, no, you can't fall asleep after that, Kana.

1179
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,840
Kana, we need explanation!

1180
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,680
It's no-money-kone-kone-chate-tote-y-o.

1181
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,100
Oh, what's

1182
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:01,350
that?

1183
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,210
Big cursor, get out of there.

1184
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:03,890
Hi!

1185
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:06,430
Oh, look how cute her face is, though.

1186
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:11,350
Look at her little smile!

1187
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:12,450
Wait, it's so cute!

1188
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,890
Wait, what was it, Kana?

1189
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:17,070
Kana, what was it?

1190
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:17,730
Sophie!

1191
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:20,750
Chittle man, welcome to Mamu Shepda.

1192
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:22,950
Wait, there was literally no...

1193
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:24,110
We didn't do anything.

1194
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:26,010
We cleared it.

1195
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,450
I win by doing nothing.

1196
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:33,690
Okay, before we go to night two, let's do really...

1197
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:33,910
Oysu!

1198
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,150
Oysu!

1199
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:36,470
Wait!

1200
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:43,150
We are- I think though our costume we can still get other...

1201
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,430
How do I equip?

1202
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:50,410
Oh, like that.

1203
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:51,310
Okay.

1204
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:52,890
Breeze!

1205
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:54,770
Breeze!

1206
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,290
Oh, she doesn't- wait.

1207
01:22:58,490 --> 01:22:59,090
Uh...

1208
01:22:59,090 --> 01:22:59,930
Wait, Breeze!

1209
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:01,190
Oh no!

1210
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:02,550
She has a pencil skirt!

1211
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:10,980
Wait,

1212
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:22,490
wait, wait, wait, we can do this, we can do this, we can do
this, we can do this, we can do this, we can do this, we can

1213
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:30,130
do this, we can do this, we can do this, we can do this, oh,
why is she crying, why are you crying,

1214
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:39,350
freeze, wait, but if it's It doesn't matter.

1215
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:55,020
Akashachi, thank you so much for the 10 gifts, and thank
you!

1216
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,540
So sensitive mode means...

1217
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,120
Whoa!

1218
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:14,830
One start.

1219
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:23,160
Come on, Juna, you can see everything!

1220
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,280
Oh, ow!

1221
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,960
Whoa, it looks like she's holding it up.

1222
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,880
Oh my god.

1223
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,860
Now we're talking.

1224
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,120
Pure, elegant.

1225
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,380
Oh my gosh, right?

1226
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,280
They're so cute.

1227
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,760
The zebra ones are hilarious.

1228
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,340
I'm curious.

1229
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,400
Poca Daughter is so cute!

1230
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,140
Love, love, love.

1231
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,540
I

1232
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,200
like the bunny in the farm.

1233
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,560
Wait, so...

1234
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:16,220
Rin, we can never...

1235
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,720
We can never do the breeze.

1236
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:19,980
We'll just know.

1237
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:20,760
We'll just know.

1238
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,420
My princess.

1239
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:24,620
Yeah.

1240
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:25,700
Minto girl.

1241
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,120
Vlad gonna get nuked.

1242
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,780
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine!

1243
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,500
Oh, oops.

1244
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,340
It's let's do Rhin's route.

1245
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,060
Gaming...

1246
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,400
Gaming night of Siwat and Smile.

1247
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:56,560
Siwat.

1248
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:58,760
Siwat.

1249
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,120
Siwat.

1250
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:04,560
Office.

1251
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:06,840
Wasted.

1252
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,640
We get the wasted again.

1253
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,560
I think we were good.

1254
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,040
I think we were really good.

1255
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:13,820
I'm sweaty.

1256
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,040
Oh,

1257
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,780
it does say VDX there, so what is supposed to be you there?

1258
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:27,140
She's so cute.

1259
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:27,960
I love Rin.

1260
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:28,800
She's my favorite.

1261
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,020
She's so cute.

1262
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,660
She's also anime otaku, so I love her.

1263
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,840
Our hair is similar.

1264
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,380
Our hair is similar.

1265
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,380
She also forgot to change.

1266
01:26:51,380 --> 01:27:04,960
I have the Rin pop-up parent figure!

1267
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,860
It's kind of crazy that this Kurei game popped off the way
it did and like even got merged.

1268
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,940
It's kind of rare for their games.

1269
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:20,140
What's wrong?

1270
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,360
What's wrong?

1271
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,040
Are you going to try and fail Rin too?

1272
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,960
Yeah, yeah.

1273
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:44,420
I want a bunny girl out with...

1274
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,660
No, you're not such a cute one.

1275
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:58,240
She drew such a really good See, she's gonna go binge anime.

1276
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:07,800
She wants to move her body, yadi, yadi.

1277
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,400
Let's dance!

1278
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,000
A super special move?

1279
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:18,700
What does that mean?

1280
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,260
What is a hair root catastrophe?

1281
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:34,320
Uh-oh, she gonna...

1282
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,260
She gonna...

1283
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:35,980
...

1284
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:36,040
...

1285
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:36,540
...

1286
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:36,760
...

1287
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:36,820
...

1288
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,520
...

1289
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:38,900
...

1290
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:48,720
Pulling someone's hair?

1291
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,180
She's going to swat.

1292
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:52,700
Yeah.

1293
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:53,560
I'm swatting.

1294
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,020
I do wonder what time it is.

1295
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,120
Like, what time does the bunny garden close, you know?

1296
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,260
1 a.m?

1297
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,660
No, I can't...

1298
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,460
11 p.m.

1299
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:07,740
maybe?

1300
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:08,880
11 p.m.

1301
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,260
There's nothing open.

1302
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:12,940
...

1303
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:13,120
...

1304
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:16,380
...

1305
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:16,500
...

1306
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:16,920
...

1307
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:16,980
...

1308
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,300
She's falling asleep in the streets?

1309
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,520
Look how cute she is though.

1310
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,420
It's okay, you can fall asleep in the streets as a treat.

1311
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,000
...

1312
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,960
Shibuya meltdown.

1313
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,340
Shibuya meltdown in Akibo.

1314
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:38,880
...

1315
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,060
Well, these places don't really...

1316
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:45,120
Actually, I don't know.

1317
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:47,020
Because I can't go to these places.

1318
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,340
They usually don't let girls go as like customers.

1319
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:54,420
But I feel like 11pm is probably normal.

1320
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,560
It's like when most mid cafes close is 11.

1321
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:05,100
And I wouldn't count this as like a hostess club.

1322
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,000
You know, so...

1323
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,580
Yeah, gotta be...

1324
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:18,400
Usually things close before last train.

1325
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:25,860
Because last train is like, depending on what line it is,
it's like 11 to 1 a.m.

1326
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,400
is depending on the train, so...

1327
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:29,300
Okay.

1328
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:35,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, where am I going?

1329
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,800
Yep, yep, yep, yep, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope.

1330
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,240
You're fine, you're fine.

1331
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:44,920
Nope, that way.

1332
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:45,900
That way.

1333
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:46,900
That way.

1334
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:47,700
That way.

1335
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,340
That way.

1336
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,320
That way.

1337
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,240
Yeah, yeah.

1338
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:52,480
Get the, so true.

1339
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:53,640
That way.

1340
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,320
That way.

1341
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,240
That way.

1342
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,360
That way.

1343
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,620
That way.

1344
01:30:59,260 --> 01:30:59,700
That way.

1345
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:01,020
That way.

1346
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:01,100
That way.

1347
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:01,760
That way.

1348
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,080
We got the Andes.

1349
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,880
Oh my god, you tapped them.

1350
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:20,940

1358
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:51,520
To get them!

1359
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,600
Okay, we gotta go inside, I think.

1360
01:31:55,320 --> 01:32:00,500
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,320
We're fine!

1362
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,820
You can pick up healing items and panties in the convenience
store.

1363
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,300
into a shelf will cause.

1364
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,800
What will it cause?

1365
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,580
I wish I could see anything.

1366
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,020
Oh, so sorry.

1367
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:16,880
Excuse me.

1368
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:17,720
I'm sorry.

1369
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:18,860
I'm so sorry.

1370
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:19,720
Excuse me.

1371
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:21,680
I can't...

1372
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,080
Oh, sorry.

1373
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:24,780
I'm so sorry.

1374
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:25,880
Oh my god.

1375
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,200
Legendary?

1376
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,380
Oh my god.

1377
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,680
I can't see anything, you guys.

1378
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:37,780
Wait, there's more!

1379
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,760
We must...

1380
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,480
We have to destroy everything!

1381
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,440
Oh my god, I can't see it!

1382
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:46,860
Ah!

1383
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:53,320
When the drunk gauge is full and a few seconds past, the
gauge will overheat the cast member will become dizzy and

1384
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:53,940
pass out!

1385
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:55,600
I passed out.

1386
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,700
We're fine.

1387
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:58,300
Everything's okay.

1388
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,740
Keep knocking it over.

1389
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:02,700
Yeah.

1390
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:04,760
Lucky.

1391
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:05,980
Yeah.

1392
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:06,960
Yeah.

1393
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,960
Yeah, yeah.

1394
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:10,740
Yeah, yeah!

1395
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:13,060
Is this also?

1396
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:15,960
No, this is normal.

1397
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,900
Where do I go then?

1398
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,060
Okay.

1399
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,280
This way?

1400
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,240
This way?

1401
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,860
This way?

1402
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:29,480
This way?

1403
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:30,180
This way?

1404
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:31,260
This way?

1405
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:33,380
Ouch!

1406
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:34,200
Ouch!

1407
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,720
Okay, I think I need to go through this way.

1408
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,840
It seems.

1409
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:40,420
Ow!

1410
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:40,780
Ow!

1411
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,200
This way, this way.

1412
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:43,660
Nope.

1413
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,660
Oh, yes?

1414
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:45,500
No, never mind.

1415
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:46,400
Oh, this way!

1416
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,720
Oh my god, I'm running into everything.

1417
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,200
I'm running into everything.

1418
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:51,560
I'm running into everything.

1419
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:52,980
This one.

1420
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:54,300
Ouch!

1421
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:55,180
Ouch!

1422
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:57,840
It's fine!

1423
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,200
It's fine, everyone!

1424
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,780
Wait, we might lose our clothes, though, when we...

1425
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,380
Wait, does that mean we're gonna lose our clothes?

1426
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,220
Is that what that means?

1427
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:05,460
Ouch.

1428
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:05,680
Ouch.

1429
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:06,520
Ouch.

1430
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,460
See that little clothing thing right there?

1431
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:14,760
Oh my god, I can't stop running into everything, you guys.

1432
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,680
Wait, there's a healing item!

1433
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,440
There's a healing...

1434
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,900
Right there, right there.

1435
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,700
Oh, did I die?

1436
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,040
I think I just died.

1437
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,440
No!

1438
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,500
Please no, don't make me redo it from the start!

1439
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:35,780
Oh my god!

1440
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,200
Oh my god, well we learned.

1441
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:42,140
Whoa, wait, but...

1442
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:44,140
Oh, oh, my panties are still picked up though.

1443
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,660
That's good, that's good.

1444
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,040
Wait, we could get even more.

1445
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,280
The store is restocked.

1446
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:53,780
Ouch.

1447
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:54,560
Ouch, ouch.

1448
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,560
No, no, no, turn around, turn around.

1449
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:57,620
This way.

1450
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:58,220
This way.

1451
01:34:58,540 --> 01:34:58,980
Yeah, you're fine.

1452
01:34:59,220 --> 01:34:59,520
You're fine.

1453
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,000
You're fine.

1454
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:00,540
You're okay.

1455
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:01,180
You're okay.

1456
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:01,840
Yeah, yeah.

1457
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,580
Oh my god.

1458
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:04,080
Look at her go.

1459
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:05,020
Look at her go.

1460
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,940
She's... Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1461
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:09,300
Everything's okay.

1462
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,620
You're okay.

1463
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,520
I can't see it.

1464
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:13,340
Okay.

1465
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:13,980
Oh, this way.

1466
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:14,900
This way.

1467
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:15,260
Yep.

1468
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:17,820
Turn around.

1469
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:24,140
I can't get it through the door.

1470
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:27,680
No!

1471
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:28,080
No!

1472
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:30,020
No!

1473
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:30,080
No!

1474
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:30,660
All right.

1475
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,060
This way.

1476
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,400
Oh, we're almost inside.

1477
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:32,780
Oh my god.

1478
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,040
No!

1479
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:35,700
Please!

1480
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,480
Just go inside!

1481
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:38,460
Doors!

1482
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:39,540
She's allergic!

1483
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:40,960
She's a vampire!

1484
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,080
She has to be invited first or something!

1485
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:44,560
Okay, hold on.

1486
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:45,400
I'm gonna let the heat...

1487
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:48,260
Oh my god.

1488
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:49,920
Wait, are we gonna lose clothes?

1489
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,860
It really is, Senran Kagura!

1490
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,620
Okay, all right.

1491
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:01,700
That way.

1492
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:03,220
There.

1493
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:04,600
Keep going forward.

1494
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,260
There we go.

1495
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:07,820
Yeah, keep going there.

1496
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:08,380
Yeah.

1497
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,340
Yeah.

1498
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,080
Yeah.

1499
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:10,420
There we go.

1500
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,520
Keep going forward.

1501
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:12,120
Yeah.

1502
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,080
And forward.

1503
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:13,620
Yeah.

1504
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:14,260
Ah!

1505
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:15,680
We made it!

1506
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,600
Okay, now we can destroy everything that we want.

1507
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,400
Oh, I can't gauge.

1508
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,040
Yes!

1509
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,440
Yes!

1510
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,020
Oh!

1511
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:32,060
Okay, it seems like all of the panties are already gone.

1512
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:34,800
That's okay.

1513
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:37,740
Okay.

1514
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:42,320
Okay, the camera is the final blast, honestly.

1515
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,200
Okay, all right.

1516
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:50,540
All right.

1517
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,140
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

1518
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:53,880
Don't, don't cry.

1519
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,300
Don't cry.

1520
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:55,460
Ow!

1521
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,340
Don't cry.

1522
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,980
We're fine, everybody.

1523
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,100
Okay, this way.

1524
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,200
This way.

1525
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:04,680
This way.

1526
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:05,280
Keep going.

1527
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,240
Keep going.

1528
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:06,520
Here.

1529
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,560
Okay, keep going, keep going.

1530
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:14,860
Yeah.

1531
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,380
This way, this way.

1532
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:19,180
Ouch!

1533
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:20,340
Oh my god.

1534
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,020
Oh my god.

1535
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:23,540
No, no, no.

1536
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:25,080
Oh, keep going.

1537
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:25,800
Keep going!

1538
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:26,820
Keep going!

1539
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:28,140
Keep going!

1540
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:31,820
I think you guys were gonna have to abandon that legendary
one over there.

1541
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,240
Wait, why'd you turn around?

1542
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:33,960
Don't do that.

1543
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:35,660
Go this way.

1544
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,200
Go this way.

1545
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:37,140
Yeah, yeah.

1546
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,080
Go this way.

1547
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,400
Oh no, oh no!

1548
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:42,960
Oh no, please!

1549
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,400
Where's the goal?

1550
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,080
This is impossible, everybody.

1551
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,740
This might be impossible.

1552
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:52,940
Oh my god.

1553
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:53,820
Okay.

1554
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:55,460
Alright, come on.

1555
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,240
You're fine.

1556
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:58,240
You're fine.

1557
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:58,740
You're fine.

1558
01:37:59,180 --> 01:37:59,800
Everything's okay.

1559
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:00,900
Please.

1560
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,040
See?

1561
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,460
Oh, I thought that was health.

1562
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,700
It's just...

1563
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:28,740
Oh my god.

1564
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,060
Guys, we might explode again.

1565
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,420
What?

1566
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:42,460
This is like the second stage!

1567
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,380
No, stinking way!

1568
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,780
Oh my god.

1569
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:57,500
Okay, Zenyoku dash, yeah!

1570
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,000
No, no, no, maybe not.

1571
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,000
Zenyoku dash.

1572
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:05,240
Maybe slow and steady wins the race, like a turtle.

1573
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:07,840
And we're not gonna go into...

1574
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,140
We're not gonna go into the...

1575
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:14,080
Oh my god.

1576
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,360
Ouch.

1577
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:16,920
We're not gonna go into the conveni.

1578
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:17,740
Ouch, ouch.

1579
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:18,360
We're okay.

1580
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,240
We're not gonna explode.

1581
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:21,280
We might explode.

1582
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:22,460
Actually, that one's like...

1583
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:23,680
What?

1584
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:26,280
Oh my god.

1585
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,620
If you hit certain things, sometimes panties.

1586
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,640
fly out.

1587
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,600
Why are the barrels of nitroglycerate in Japan?

1588
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,420
In the alleyways of Akihabara!

1589
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:48,280
You guys they tell you about like you know, chikan or you
know, they tell you to be afraid of people but they never

1590
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,780
tell you about the barrels.

1591
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:53,140
The barrel, the exploding barrels.

1592
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:54,740
Oh my god.

1593
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:57,260
I'm sorry.

1594
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:01,160
Sorry, we're doing, we're already doing a little bit better
though.

1595
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,200
We're already, we're already doing a little bit better.

1596
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,520
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1597
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,140
Good job, good job.

1598
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,160
It's okay, it's okay.

1599
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:22,120
Honestly, I almost want to like just ram through these boxes
here.

1600
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,460
These ones right here.

1601
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,500
Shortcut, shortcut!

1602
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:27,080
Okay.

1603
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,200
There's the goal!

1604
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:32,860
No!

1605
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,920
Please, please!

1606
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:40,080
The goal!

1607
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,460
The goal!

1608
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:42,560
The goal!

1609
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:57,720
Oh my god.

1610
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,140
I kind of wish that we had exploded into the goal.

1611
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:03,320
It would have been really great.

1612
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,140
Alright, time to drink water, everybody!

1613
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:10,420
Take a sip when she dies, okay?

1614
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:13,860
It's a little drinking but with water.

1615
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:24,310
Yeah, there's yeah, there's there's there's.

1616
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:25,570
You have water.

1617
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,420
But if she gets waterboarded, so do you, okay?

1618
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,680
That's literally the rules.

1619
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:38,360
If she waterboards, so do you too, okay?

1620
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:40,580
Just dump it all in your mouth, all right?

1621
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,640
I only have run.

1622
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:47,900
No!

1623
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,880
Let's see how it looks with the sensor off.

1624
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:56,600
Oh wait, you're right.

1625
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,540
Wait, is she also?

1626
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,620
Are her clothes gonna be torn?

1627
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:01,980
You think?

1628
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:13,270
I did see though that if you play this game on the Switch,
the colors are censored.

1629
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:16,870
If you...

1630
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:18,610
Yeah, we'll get the bad end first.

1631
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:24,250
But luckily I'm playing on Steam!

1632
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:27,030
Itadakimasu!

1633
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:40,170
She's such a drunk girl.

1634
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:41,530
See rabbit ears?

1635
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:43,810
Where's the rest of the traditional outfit?

1636
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:48,050
Tray of drinks?

1637
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:50,530
I'm a bunny.

1638
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:52,970
I'm a bunny.

1639
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:54,710
Alright.

1640
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:56,950
Let's drink, guys.

1641
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,010
Let's do it.

1642
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:59,170
We got this.

1643
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:02,290
Except not at first, because I want the bad end.

1644
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,410
Oh, her clothes are torn.

1645
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,700
A little sip as a treat.

1646
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:28,600
A little sip as a treat.

1647
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:33,040
We're failing this one on purpose, guys, so we can see the
bad end, because it's funny.

1648
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:34,380
Yaru's supremacy.

1649
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:34,880
Yeah!

1650
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:39,400
Okay.

1651
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:55,820
on switch it's like getting skincare from shrek let's see
what happens oh my god wait no that's so embarrassing oh

1652
01:43:55,820 --> 01:44:07,760
wait are we in jail is this our one call you think oh no oh
no Oh no.

1653
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:12,820
Oh no.

1654
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:15,900
Oh no.

1655
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:21,980
Oh no.

1656
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:22,560
Oh no.

1657
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,120
Oh no.

1658
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:24,620
No.

1659
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,220
Oh no.

1660
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,500
Oh no.

1661
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,020
Oh no.

1662
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,120
Oh no.

1663
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:36,500
Oh no.

1664
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,140
Do they give one phone call in Japan?

1665
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,080
I don't know.

1666
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:45,520
I think it's a similar thing as before where we appear on
the TV.

1667
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:48,900
Oh, wait a second.

1668
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:50,360
It's the same exact...

1669
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,780
It's the same exact picture!

1670
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,200
They just swapped the heads!

1671
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:06,500
But...

1672
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,300
Aw, me!

1673
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:17,880
I don't want to church to crypto, I feel like we got
cheated, you guys.

1674
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,980
The music is so funny though, it's so sad.

1675
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:30,400
Okay, I'm gonna skip it then.

1676
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,840
Oh, well let me skip, just kidding.

1677
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:36,980
Yeah, we got scammed, for real!

1678
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:39,060
Dang.

1679
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,220
That's fun.

1680
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,620
Dame, dame, dame, dame, dame.

1681
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,740
Dame, dame, dame.

1682
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:56,420
Almost Western, the music?

1683
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:57,080
I don't know.

1684
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,740
Go on.

1685
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:08,340
That's a totally legal business.

1686
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:09,400
Star!

1687
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:36,220
Are you proud of me, ma'am?

1688
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:37,800
I'm on the telly.

1689
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:38,180
I'm on the telly.

1690
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:39,620
Not

1691
01:46:47,040 --> 01:47:00,840
the respect.

1692
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,270
All respect lost.

1693
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:13,410
No, I'm absolutely not drinking too much.

1694
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:15,570
I'm sorry!

1695
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:22,350
Bad end.

1696
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:23,590
Okay, we gotta try the...

1697
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:24,670
We gotta redo the minigame.

1698
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:26,110
I'll do it properly this time.

1699
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:27,710
Nodogu...

1700
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:29,510
...kawaita zhe...

1701
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:29,810
Okay.

1702
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:31,250
I don't...

1703
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:32,150
How was I supposed to do that?

1704
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,170
I think I just hold it, right?

1705
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:36,390
Drink!

1706
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:36,710
Drink!

1707
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:37,070
Drink!

1708
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:38,770
Drink!

1709
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:42,350
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

1710
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:43,930
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

1711
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:45,670
Hydrate!

1712
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:46,770
Hydrate!

1713
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:47,790
Oh, sorry.

1714
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:48,970
Too much hydrate!

1715
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:50,010
Hydrate!

1716
01:47:52,030 --> 01:47:52,650
Hydrate!

1717
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:59,010
Thank you so much for the fine gift in!

1718
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:00,730
What a face.

1719
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:05,230
I got an A still!

1720
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:06,210
Let's go!

1721
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:08,630
Even though...

1722
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:13,550
Even though I took so much damage, Woohoo!

1723
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:15,930
Whoa, my abs.

1724
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:17,070
Look at her abs.

1725
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:17,670
Whoa!

1726
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:20,550
Bonus panties.

1727
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:23,730
Not the zebra again.

1728
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:27,090
Wait, those are so cute!

1729
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:29,830
Yes, yes, yes!

1730
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:33,690
Ooh, simple we like.

1731
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:38,410
Calvin Clay!

1732
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:41,810
Wait, why is that?

1733
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:44,190
This is spelled with a K here and a Q there.

1734
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,890
Localizers, please explain.

1735
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:53,630
Cow Ben Klein!

1736
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:55,870
Whoa!

1737
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:59,670
Hydra Angel, that's my favorite flower!

1738
01:49:01,810 --> 01:49:02,710
Pure, elegant.

1739
01:49:04,190 --> 01:49:05,490
Holy cow!

1740
01:49:05,690 --> 01:49:06,950
How are these a one star?

1741
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:08,310
Excuse me?

1742
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:10,390
Oh!

1743
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:16,480
Royal Maid!

1744
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,360
Dang, we got a lot.

1745
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:21,060
Waterfly.

1746
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:22,800
Royal Maid.

1747
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:24,020
Low rise.

1748
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,880
Where are the strawberry ones?

1749
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:26,780
They're so cute!

1750
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:29,860
Yes!

1751
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:33,280
But they got the Shima Pan.

1752
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:38,660
Military girl.

1753
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,460
Strawberry pink.

1754
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,520
Holy moly.

1755
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:50,400
She...

1756
01:49:53,690 --> 01:50:00,910
She go to the Geshe and plays...

1757
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:02,810
She plays GDR.

1758
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:06,170
In her heels and in her...

1759
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:07,970
In her body uniform.

1760
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:11,790
Cha-Lan!

1761
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:13,490
La-Lan!

1762
01:50:16,490 --> 01:50:18,090
What's our fateful encounter?

1763
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:18,870
Wait, what happened?

1764
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:21,390
Oh,

1765
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,570
she just wanted to go play?

1766
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:28,950
Okay.

1767
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:36,570
You know one thing that kind of takes me out of her being a
gyaru are her nails.

1768
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:38,830
They're just not done up enough.

1769
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:42,850
They're not like long enough and don't have enough deco on
them.

1770
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:46,670
The nails need to be way more flashy.

1771
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:49,410
Duh.

1772
01:50:56,270 --> 01:50:58,650
Is that physique attainable?

1773
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:00,730
Probably.

1774
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:10,390
If you play her route in the game, she actually isn't a
gyaru.

1775
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:10,990
Oh, really?

1776
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:13,290
I didn't finish Bunny Girl.

1777
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:15,150
Or a bunny guard in the original.

1778
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:21,110
She just is...

1779
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:23,910
Gengi cute girl?

1780
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:36,490
But even still, girls in Japan are very serious about their
nails.

1781
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:41,610
I feel like even still she would have much flashier nails,
even if she's...

1782
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:43,150
Not all Gyaru have like super...

1783
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:48,530
Or rather, you don't have to be a Gyaru to have the flashier
nails.

1784
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:58,130
She's dorky who likes games and stuff.

1785
01:51:58,330 --> 01:51:59,290
Yeah, I remember that though.

1786
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:01,130
That's why I liked her as my favorite.

1787
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:03,810
But that doesn't mean anything.

1788
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:06,330
I mean, do you watch a Biscuit doll too?

1789
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:07,990
She has really fancy nails.

1790
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:12,170
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1791
01:52:14,970 --> 01:52:15,410
Wait,

1792
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:22,570
why are you...

1793
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:23,710
Wait, why are we taking off our clothes?

1794
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:34,050
I don't think it's the clothes that are heavy.

1795
01:52:35,190 --> 01:52:37,370
I think it's the thing that the clothes are...

1796
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:39,210
What?

1797
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,090
Wait, what?

1798
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:46,450
Weighted clothing.

1799
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:47,990
She's rock-ly.

1800
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,390
What?

1801
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:53,190
Your panties and your bra weigh 5 kilograms!

1802
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:57,090
Oh, okay.

1803
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:19,270
I guess that's true.

1804
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:21,530
Helps with aerodynamics.

1805
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:30,490
I always play on the dance pad naked.

1806
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:34,310
People are watching.

1807
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:42,290
Wait, so if the game center is even open, what time is it?

1808
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:55,820
What is this cowboy music playing?

1809
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:59,100
The cow...

1810
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,720
Wait, what's happening?

1811
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:11,940
The cowboy...

1812
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:13,660
Wait, she's taking off her clothes!

1813
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,280
Oh my gosh, she really is gonna be on the news.

1814
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:29,060
Never go outside, everybody.

1815
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:37,800
Let's try the night routine again.

1816
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:41,320
Let's try it.

1817
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:43,080
We don't need to do the relaxation.

1818
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,660
She's pooped.

1819
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,220
Good sweat.

1820
01:54:52,380 --> 01:55:02,800
good everybody but after this we can try her second night
that's what I'm really curious about I want to keep trying

1821
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:11,120
the harder levels especially because now we know we can
explode what else will there be I wonder if there will be

1822
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:13,240
like animals that try to attack us too

1823
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,320
Why is she so violent to me?

1824
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,340
Kruna, thank you so much for the time, Kete!

1825
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:30,000
I just said not, Ducky.

1826
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:30,880
Why you said a poop?

1827
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:32,500
Oh, because she's pooped, yeah.

1828
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:35,980
She's pooped!

1829
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:42,880
You guys, my cat pooped in the letterbox and the poop was
sticking straight up.

1830
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,620
How does it do that?

1831
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:46,260
Yeah!

1832
01:55:57,140 --> 01:55:58,020
What's a fiber?

1833
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:12,560
That's how I feel about my maid cafe too though when I look
at my decorations and stuff I'm like Anime paradise

1834
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:21,700
Oh no I forgot about the yoga

1835
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,660
Bad skills.

1836
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:35,280
Everybody do yoga.

1837
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:37,060
It's good for you.

1838
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:38,500
Yoga, yoga.

1839
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:43,360
Yeah, wait.

1840
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,900
We're going to yoga without the...

1841
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:46,520
But our clothes.

1842
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:47,920
But our clothes.

1843
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:57,080
Oh my god, I'm still busted up!

1844
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:58,860
No!

1845
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:01,320
Oh, okay, okay.

1846
01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:13,320
Oh, it's just the patties.

1847
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:18,710
The headlights, you guys!

1848
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:23,290
Oh my god, the truck is incoming!

1849
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:26,730
It's not a pair of boobs, it's a truck!

1850
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:28,270
Get out of the road!

1851
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:29,550
Get out of the road!

1852
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:30,330
What are you doing?

1853
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:31,790
Just standing there!

1854
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,790
You're gonna get hit by the truck!

1855
01:57:36,610 --> 01:57:38,910
This ghost swag ectoplasm.

1856
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:40,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1857
01:57:42,110 --> 01:57:43,070
Good day.

1858
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:44,390
I'm sorry.

1859
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:46,310
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1860
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:46,810
I'm sorry.

1861
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:47,990
I'm sorry.

1862
01:57:53,870 --> 01:57:57,630
What a time to be a deer in the headlights!

1863
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:03,010
We're gonna warp?

1864
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:06,570
Might I ask what this game be about?

1865
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:13,230
Do you know Bunny Garden, the original?

1866
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:18,150
Trash boy, welcome back!

1867
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:20,230
Okay, time for bath, baby.

1868
01:58:23,450 --> 01:58:25,990
Without the lie, wait, wait, hide.

1869
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:30,230
Wow, very, very, it's nice and sunny, everybody.

1870
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:35,930
I also giggle while I'm in the...

1871
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:40,530
Wait, what do you mean you're not good at washing your
armpits?

1872
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,170
How are you, how is it?

1873
01:58:43,610 --> 01:58:45,410
Oh, because it's ticklish.

1874
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:52,670
Also, why do you have soap in your hair?

1875
01:58:53,450 --> 01:58:55,470
Yeah,

1876
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:01,570
I was gonna say.

1877
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:06,570
Pat's truck good.

1878
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:11,310
She's got the three-in-one.

1879
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:23,930
Oh no!

1880
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:26,450
Your pink will wash out!

1881
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:31,450
Pink is a hard color to maintain.

1882
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:39,610
Training?

1883
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:43,110
Oh, she's gonna tickle herself?

1884
01:59:43,670 --> 01:59:45,930
She's a liar, you can't tickle yourself.

1885
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:48,330
She's just trying to get you to touch her.

1886
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:50,590
Run me though, her intentions are not pure!

1887
01:59:51,330 --> 01:59:52,310
She's scamming me!

1888
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:53,270
She's scamming me!

1889
01:59:53,450 --> 02:00:05,130
I laugh

1890
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:10,440
in the shower too.

1891
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:14,840
I laugh in the shower too.

1892
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:27,380
Which area are we doing next?

1893
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:32,440
You're already explaining your actions, please, in great
detail.

1894
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:38,720
If you're going to say every step by step, you'll have to
tell me where you're touching next.

1895
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:41,360
It's only the reals.

1896
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:49,620
She's so ticklish.

1897
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,240
Wait, is it really true that you can't tickle yourself?

1898
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,680
Is it true?

1899
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,900
I'm going to try tickling my foot.

1900
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,320
It does kind of tickle, though.

1901
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:09,860
It does kind of tickle, though.

1902
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:13,260
But my armpits are not ticklish at all.

1903
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:14,180
That's sensitive area.

1904
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:26,900
I guess...

1905
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:27,860
You know that.

1906
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:30,320
You know.

1907
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:38,520
the thing where someone grabs your knee like the the points
on each side of your knee like if i grab that part it's not

1908
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:43,820
ticklish but if someone else were to grab that part you know
what i mean it's ticklish

1909
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,660
yeah that part is ticklish no you guys know

1910
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:09,860
yeah it's tickles when someone else tickles yeah yeah yeah
the So the side, each, like on each side of your knee.

1911
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,840
Like just not, like not on the bone, just a little bit above
it, you know?

1912
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:20,620
If you do it yourself, it's not going to be ticklish.

1913
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:22,940
But if somebody else does it, it's ticklish.

1914
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:27,400
Have you never had siblings that would do that?

1915
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:32,720
Scientifically, only ticklish spot is the roof of your mouth
using your tongue.

1916
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:35,700
Oh, it is.

1917
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:38,760
It's ticklish!

1918
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:42,320
Wait, how is that possible?

1919
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:45,640
Now I have to scratch it.

1920
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:48,500
Wait, how is that possible?

1921
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,280
Oh my god, it's ticklish.

1922
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:57,160
I have to scratch it with my tongue.

1923
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:01,900
What?

1924
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:07,620
That's craziness.

1925
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,000
New fear unlocked.

1926
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:14,640
We're gonna try Aare.

1927
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:16,420
That's a try.

1928
02:03:16,620 --> 02:03:17,120
Skincare?

1929
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:17,700
Yeah!

1930
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:18,840
Oh no.

1931
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,440
Oh no.

1932
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:27,500
Do you have any skincare routines we recommend for people
with eczema?

1933
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:32,840
I once possessed somebody with eczema, so I got pretty used
to it.

1934
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:37,100
I will do a skincare stream.

1935
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:39,640
I will do a skincare stream.

1936
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:41,420
Do a skincare stream.

1937
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:49,200
My dad was only ticklish on the side of his big toes.

1938
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,500
I kind of feel it though.

1939
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:56,760
Mm.

1940
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:57,760
Mm.

1941
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:58,040
Mm.

1942
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:00,520
Oh my god, girl math.

1943
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:01,220
Girl math!

1944
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:06,020
I can't tickle the roof of my mouth with my own tongue.

1945
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:07,760
Maybe you can tickle it with yours.

1946
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:31,620
You guys are freaks!

1947
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:33,080
Freaks and perverts!

1948
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:37,540
Get your hands out of the gutter, you freaks and perverts!

1949
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:45,400
Oh, uh, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

1954
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:08,540
This is the person who chose this game.

1955
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,940
Shake, shake, shake, shake your skincare, shake your
skincare.

That better look at your favorite Sephora.

Don't hold up the mirror to me!

1958

Right in the kisser.

1959
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:38,100
It's skincare, everybody.

1960
02:05:38,420 --> 02:05:38,800
Skincare.

It's the slugging method.

1965
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:53,040
That's a real thing, you guys.

1966
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:53,800
It's a real thing.

1967

02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:33,740
Yes,

1984
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,940
you are mean though.

1985
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:48,520
Kana's My... my extra pleasure would melt.

1986
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:51,440
Take her.

1987
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:52,880
Oh, mochi-cairie!

1988
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:58,940
What are you a dog?

1989
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,180
A dog?

1990
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,200
A walk every day?

1991
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:07,420
Yeah, we can't sleep.

1992
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,300
All these girls yapping their sleep.

1993
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,980
I don't think you'll ever get any...

1994
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:12,160
They would like...

1995
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,000
They would like...

1996
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:18,960
They would... their dreams would be used together and they
would just have conversations.

1997
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:22,480
They would just have conversations in their sleep probably.

1998
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:24,980
Aww, awry, awry!

1999
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:26,720
Kiko, Eiko, Eiko!

2000
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:27,900
Let's go home.

2001
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:30,180
Kyoon!

2002
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:32,920
Oh, a...

2003
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:34,540
Aheadishikawaigari.

2004
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,440
It's a good quinoa and a bad shiwa...

2005
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:44,840
I don't think you should iron that.

2006
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:46,800
I think you should use a steamer on it probably.

2007
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:50,560
Kha 'ai, K'ai, K'ai, K'ai.

2008
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:57,140
Where in the wild wish?

2009
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:01,920
I can't… Where in the wild wish?

2010
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:07,420
I can't… …

2011
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:18,100
Oh, she's a sister, that's right.

2012
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:19,020
Moika?

2013
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:20,120
I remember that.

2014
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

2015
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:21,800
So, yeah.

2016
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:22,140
So, yeah.

2017
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:25,640
So, Moika, too.

2018
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:27,080
Yeah.

2019
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:28,780
Moika comes too.

2020
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:31,040
Mm.

2021
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:31,680
Mm.

02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:32,500
Mm.

2025
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:33,700
Mm.

2026
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:33,940
Mm.

2027
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,020
Mm.

2028
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:35,220
Mm.

2029
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:35,900
Mm.

2030
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:41,340
Oh my god, the family!

2031
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:50,460
Oh my god, the family!

2032
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,200
They're problematic to watch in the office.

2033
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:06,680
We love you a bit more.

2034
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:08,020
Cypher!

2035
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:09,880
Good luck with work!

2036
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,720
Oh, okay, okay.

2037
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:12,640
Oh, geez.

2038
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:13,620
Okay.

2039
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:14,340
Oh, oh geez.

2040
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:14,700
Okay.

2041
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:16,240
Wait, is there anything behind me?

2042
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:16,820
Ouch.

2043
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:17,660
A wall?

2044
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:19,300
Okay.

2045
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:21,080
This way?

2046
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:21,960
This way, Miyuka?

2047
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:26,280
This way, Miyuka?

2048
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:28,360
Oh, Miyuka.

2049
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:29,740
Wait in front of you.

2050
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:30,660
Yata!

2051
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:31,280
Yata!

2052
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:31,760
Yeah, yeah.

2053
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:34,180
Oh, gosh, there's a 24-hour camera here.

2054
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,280
That's not the...

2055
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:37,220
They're gonna see me.

2056
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:38,920
They're gonna...

2057
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:39,880
Oh!

2058
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:41,740
Oh!

2059
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:42,020
Oh!

2060
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:42,720
Oh!

2061
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:46,280
Okay, forward.

2062
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:47,460
Forward.

2063
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:50,820
Yes.

2064
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:54,880
I wonder where this is supposed to be.

2065
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,460
Is that gold?

2066
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,680
That's not rainbow.

2067
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,360
Oh my god.

2068
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:58,620
Oh!

2069
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:02,960
Wait, oh, it won't let me.

2070
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:04,780
I was gonna say it won't let us go into the road.

2071
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:06,200
Okay.

2072
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:09,100
Alright guys, nice.

2073
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:10,240
Come on.

2074
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:13,820
I see a rainbow over there.

2075
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:15,420
I see it, I see it.

2076
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:16,900
Wait, there's people!

2077
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:18,400
What are those?

2078
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:18,820
Wait.

2079
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:20,340
Uh-oh.

2080
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:21,260
Wait, there's people.

2081
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:22,860
Wait, there's...

2082
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:24,800
Did she just say it smells good?

2083
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,300
So we know the smell now.

2084
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,140
What the- Yeah, yeah, lucky, lucky.

2085
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:41,460
Oh my god, the bird is attacking me!

2086
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,940
Oh my god, oh my god, the bird!

2087
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,080
Oh my god!

2088
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:55,260
Okay, we can make it through this one.

2089
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:58,200
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.

2090
02:11:59,320 --> 02:11:59,720
Yes!

2091
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:01,000
We're too good.

2092
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:02,420
We're too good, guys.

2093
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:05,660
RJ boy, we got it.

2094
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:07,020
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2095
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:09,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2096
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:17,940
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, it
was a necessary tank, we're tanking it.

2097
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,660
Why are the birds attacking me?

2098
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:24,720
Wait, we can go into the...

2099
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:28,320
Okay, yeah, yeah, nice, nice.

2100
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:35,180
Oh shoot, okay, don't get hit by the car.

2101
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:38,780
The headlines, everybody, I told you, they were real.

2102
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:39,320
Yatta!

2103
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:44,620
Destruction!

2104
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:47,440
Destruction!

2105
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:48,840
Yatta!

2106
02:12:50,580 --> 02:12:51,480
Destruction!

2107
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:54,720
Destruction!

2108
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:56,200
Destruction!

2109
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,000
Destruction!

2110
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:03,960
Alfred Hitchcock, hidden kid in inspiration.

2111
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:05,960
I don't think it's so hidden.

2112
02:13:06,660 --> 02:13:07,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2113
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:09,460
Nice!

2114
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:11,500

Wait.

2116
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:13,100
Okay.

2117
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,340
Alright, don't get hit by the car, everybody.

2118
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:19,500
Oh my god, wait.

2119
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:26,780
The car is on fire!

2120
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:27,920
Wait!

2121
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,080
Uh, how am I supposed to get through?

2122
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:32,740
Wait, uh...

2123
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:33,400
Excuse me!

2124
02:13:33,820 --> 02:13:34,120
Sorry!

2125
02:13:34,820 --> 02:13:34,860
Look!

2126
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:46,620
Oh my god!

2127
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:50,300
Guys, you think I'm gonna be able to beat this game?

2128
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:52,560
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2129
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:56,800
Why is she just sitting?

2130
02:13:57,740 --> 02:13:58,600
Like newbie.

2131
02:13:59,300 --> 02:13:59,960
Oh my god.

2132
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:01,700
I killed that guy.

2133
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:02,540
I think so!

2134
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:03,880
Oh my god!

2135
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:06,020
No, no, no, the birds!

2136
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:08,600
Why are there birds attacking me?

2137
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:12,760
There's gotta be another way!

2138
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:15,060
Oh my god, where?

2139
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,500
There's no goal in sight!

2140
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:17,500
Oh my god, the bird!

2141
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,440
Oh my god!

2142
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:20,440
Get out of here!

2143
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:23,500
Get out of here, you nasty creature!

2144
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,200
Oh!

2145
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,040
Oh, chill, chill, chill.

2146
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:29,500
Oh my god.

2147
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:30,540
Okay.

2148
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:31,820
Alright, alright, alright.

2149
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:33,860
No, no, no, no, no.

2150
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:34,980
No don't don't don't explode.

2151
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:36,000
Don't explode.

2152
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:37,000
Okay.

2153
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:39,860
Okay.

2154
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:41,500
All right.

2155
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:45,260
Oh god.

2156
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:46,200
It's okay.

2157
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:47,920
You're fine.

2158
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:51,400
Okay.

2159
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:54,200
Oh, this way, this way, this way, this way.

2160
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,960
This way, this way.

2161
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:57,260
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

2162
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:58,600
Oh no.

2163
02:14:59,240 --> 02:14:59,240
No!

2164
02:14:59,740 --> 02:14:59,980
No!

2165
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:06,440
Guys, it's so over.

2166
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:07,960
It's so over.

2167
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:09,620
How am I supposed to get around this?

2168
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:14,900
I didn't even know!

2169
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:29,120
How are you supposed to get around this?

2170
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:33,700
She's dead!

2171
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:35,240
She's dead!

2172
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:39,160
You have to move away.

2173
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:40,980
from the secondary explosion.

2174
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:43,660
Oh, I'm sorry, there's realism in this game.

2175
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:50,220
I'm sorry, I didn't, I'm sorry, I should have expected that
the car would do a second explosion because that's what

2176
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:53,980
would happen in real life if the car is on fire, you know?

2177
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,620
Bunny Cemetery.

2178
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:02,780
No way.

2179
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:04,400
Okay.

2180
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:05,440
Alright.

2181
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,180
I don't...

2182
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:17,220
I feel like I'm still learning the controls of this you know
so we like turn up the heat and then we basically oh but

2183
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:26,440
then she goes crazy mode like this oh my god miyuka please
miyuka you're okay oh no it's too hard to control when the

2184
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:36,680
heat is too high oh my god i can't control her she's a she's
a rogue bunny she's gone rogue oh my god oh my god oh my god

2185
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:40,720
i've seen so many cars on fire I've never seen them explode.

2186
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:42,200
Kana...

2187
02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:46,610
Oh, she's saying Kana has a...

2188
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:47,490
It smells good.

2189
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:47,830
Okay.

2190
02:16:49,770 --> 02:16:50,390
The bird.

2191
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:54,050
Oh my god.

2192
02:16:54,390 --> 02:16:55,910
Oh, this game is so hard.

2193
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:58,070
Wait, this game is actual rage game.

2194
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:00,350
Okay.

2195
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:02,190
Oh my god, please.

2196
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:03,050
No, out!

2197
02:17:04,970 --> 02:17:05,750
Oh my god.

2198
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:10,330
Oh, you take damage while you lay on the ground.

2199
02:17:12,410 --> 02:17:12,890
Cameraman?

2200
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:14,470
Cameraman's not me!

2201
02:17:14,530 --> 02:17:16,230
Oh my god, there's a bird attacking me!

2202
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:16,670
Please!

2203
02:17:17,230 --> 02:17:17,630
Please!

2204
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:19,370
Let me out!

2205
02:17:21,290 --> 02:17:22,410
Oh my god.

2206
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:25,190
Please leave.

2207
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:25,970
Thank you.

2208
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:26,930
Thank you, thank you.

2209
02:17:27,410 --> 02:17:30,370
I wonder if I...

2210
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:31,870
Oh, I don't think I can knock those over.

2211
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:32,450
Wait!

2212
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:36,290
If I can get across that and then also avoid the barrel?

2213
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:37,990
Oh my god, that's a shortcut.

2214
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:38,890
What?

2215
02:17:40,890 --> 02:17:42,430
I don't think I can make it though.

2216
02:17:42,570 --> 02:17:43,270
That's tiny.

2217
02:17:43,730 --> 02:17:44,950
Why am I spinning in circles?

2218
02:17:45,350 --> 02:17:46,150
Please, Miyuka!

2219
02:17:46,670 --> 02:17:47,590
I need you to go straight.

2220
02:17:50,370 --> 02:17:51,770
Oh my god, that's tiny.

2221
02:17:52,310 --> 02:17:52,990
There's no way.

2222
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:54,190
There's no way.

2223
02:17:55,610 --> 02:17:57,890
If I fall...

2224
02:17:57,890 --> 02:18:00,250
I die.

2225
02:18:00,410 --> 02:18:00,750
Wow!

2226
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:02,570
Look at them, chakes!

2227
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:07,270
I'm progressing!

2228
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:09,490
I blame heat mode.

2229
02:18:09,770 --> 02:18:10,210
I blame it.

2230
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:25,550
I want to grab those cheeks.

2231
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:29,770
I see the goal!

2232
02:18:30,690 --> 02:18:32,490
Oh my gosh, no way.

2233
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:36,410
Hold on, I'm going to try something since we're here.

2234
02:18:37,330 --> 02:18:38,470
Please just go forward.

2235
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:39,990
Please just go forward.

2236
02:18:40,490 --> 02:18:41,490
Can I go through here?

2237
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:43,050
No, okay.

2238
02:18:43,250 --> 02:18:43,560
You can't.

2239
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:47,730
This way?

2240
02:18:48,470 --> 02:18:49,310
This way?

2241
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:50,830
This way?

2242
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:52,130
That's why?

2243
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:53,310
That's why Mewka's my fave.

2244
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:57,430
I think, I feel like they all have the same character model.

2245
02:18:57,550 --> 02:18:58,230
I'm not gonna lie.

2246
02:18:59,170 --> 02:19:03,270
I could be wrong, but like, it feels like they all have
this...

2247
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:04,890
Oh my god, please stop going in circles.

2248
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:07,690
Just with their heads replaced.

2249
02:19:09,230 --> 02:19:10,470
There's like no variety.

2250
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:12,530
in their booby size at all.

2251
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:14,090
Oh my gosh.

2252
02:19:15,330 --> 02:19:16,310
Uh, please.

2253
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:18,810
Please!

2254
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:20,210
Oh, the wall!

2255
02:19:20,390 --> 02:19:22,310
Oh my god, we're taking so much mega damage!

2256
02:19:22,630 --> 02:19:23,110
Oh my god!

2257
02:19:24,690 --> 02:19:24,930
Okay.

2258
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:27,210
Bird, problem, gone.

2259
02:19:29,290 --> 02:19:29,530
Okay.

2260
02:19:30,090 --> 02:19:31,990
We need you to not go in circles.

2261
02:19:32,970 --> 02:19:33,110
Ouch.

2262
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:34,830
I need you to go forward.

2263
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:36,790
And like...

2264
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:38,090
Okay.

2265
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:42,010
Okay.

2266
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:48,840
Avoid the explosion.

2267
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:50,880
No, no, no, please.

2268
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:52,140
Please don't fall in!

2269
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:52,960
Please don't fall in!

2270
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:53,340
Please!

2271
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:55,400
Okay, okay, we're so close.

2272
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:56,500
Oh my gosh.

2273
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:57,500
Oh my gosh.

2274
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,340
No, no, no, turn around!

2275
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:02,540
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

2276
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:03,440
No, please!

2277
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:04,740
Oh my God!

2278
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:06,380
Ah, ha!

2279
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,420
Okay, go forward, go forward.

2280
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:09,380
Okay.

2281
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:11,120
Okay, oh shoot.

2282
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:11,880
Oh my God.

2283
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:13,140
Ouch.

2284
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:14,560
That took so much damage.

2285
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:16,000
Oh my god.

2286
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:17,800
Oh, we gotta get into the...

2287
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:19,840
Okay, if we get in there...

2288
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:21,900
We can just, uh...

2289
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:23,260
Get some health.

2290
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:24,560
Yeah, we'll get health in here.

2291
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:24,960
Nice.

2292
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:28,740
Yeah, gumbare, wattashi.

2293
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:29,980
We can do this?

2294
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:30,920
Okay.

2295
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:35,060
Alright, let's hold off, hold off a second.

2296
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,020
Yeah, yeah, the car's gonna come back.

2297
02:20:37,740 --> 02:20:38,620
The car's gonna come back.

2298
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:39,260
Okay, there we go.

2299
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:39,820
Now go.

2300
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:40,820
Go, go.

2301
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:43,120
Go, go, go, go.

2302
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:44,400
Go, go, go!

2303
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,720
Wait, just stay here.

2304
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:48,120
No!

2305
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:53,120
Wait, we gotta get out of here!

2306
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:54,960
We gotta get out of here!

2307
02:20:59,210 --> 02:21:00,010
Don't explode.

2308
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:01,510
Okay.

2309
02:21:02,230 --> 02:21:02,870
Oh my god.

2310
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:03,610
Oh my god.

2311
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:04,610
Wait, it's gonna explode again?

2312
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:05,210
Wait.

2313
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:06,290
Okay, we're fine.

2314
02:21:06,470 --> 02:21:06,610
We're fine.

2315
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:07,130
Everything's good.

2316
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:08,030
Okay.

2317
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:08,830
Progress!

2318
02:21:09,570 --> 02:21:10,330
Progress, everybody!

2319
02:21:12,570 --> 02:21:12,990
Oh my god.

2320
02:21:13,530 --> 02:21:14,010
Oh my god.

2321
02:21:14,250 --> 02:21:16,070
We're not even gonna try and get the Golden Undies.

2322
02:21:16,490 --> 02:21:17,630
We're just gonna keep going forward.

2323
02:21:18,430 --> 02:21:18,830
Oh my god.

2324
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:20,490
Somebody died but honestly...

2325
02:21:22,330 --> 02:21:22,690
Oh, okay.

2326
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:23,430
We gotta go this way.

2327
02:21:24,510 --> 02:21:24,570
Okay.

2328
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:28,970
Somebody died but can we really blame ourselves here?

2329
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:29,910
Ouch.

2330
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:35,350
Uh, we're gonna tank it.

2331
02:21:37,170 --> 02:21:38,290
Thank you.

2332
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:39,190
No, no, no, no, no.

2333
02:21:40,170 --> 02:21:40,910
Yeah, yeah.

2334
02:21:42,150 --> 02:21:45,050
I bet there's people really serious about this game though.

2335
02:21:46,230 --> 02:21:46,370
Ouch.

2336
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:47,030
Ouch.

2337
02:21:48,430 --> 02:21:50,190
Oh my god, another bird!

2338
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:51,990
No,

2339
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:56,270
no, no, no, no, no, no!

2340
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:58,390
Alright, keep going.

2341
02:21:58,930 --> 02:21:59,310
Keep going.

2342
02:22:00,010 --> 02:22:00,270
This way.

2343
02:22:00,330 --> 02:22:00,630
Dame.

2344
02:22:00,990 --> 02:22:01,210
Dame.

2345
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:02,170
Dame.

2346
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:02,410
Dame.

2347
02:22:02,410 --> 02:22:02,710
Dame.

2348
02:22:02,930 --> 02:22:03,110
Dame.

2349
02:22:04,810 --> 02:22:06,350
Oh, this way?

2350
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:08,790
This way?

2351
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:09,230
Okay.

2352
02:22:09,390 --> 02:22:13,230
Yeah, the bunny guard attorneys are going crazy, everybody.

2353
02:22:14,590 --> 02:22:15,570
Watch out for explosion.

2354
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:16,550
Yeah.

2355
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:17,430
There we go.

2356
02:22:18,430 --> 02:22:19,470
Watch out for explosion?

2357
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:19,950
Yeah.

2358
02:22:21,210 --> 02:22:21,890
The goal!

2359
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:23,870
Oh my god, you guys, we made it.

2360
02:22:24,690 --> 02:22:25,490
Come on!

2361
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:26,230
Miuka!

2362
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:36,580
We made it!

2363
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:39,920
Oh my god, I'm not gonna do...

2364
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:42,380
I'm not gonna fail at this time, because we already...

2365
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:42,580
Oh!

2366
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:44,580
Unless you want to see what she looks like.

2367
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:45,740
But it's the same thing.

2368
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:54,280
We got like no special ones.

2369
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:03,320
The music we want to see.

2370
02:23:04,420 --> 02:23:07,500
Oh, it was different.

2371
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:10,360
Like Rin was like, don't watch mama.

2372
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:13,940
And then, and then Kana was like, I want to be an actress.

2373
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:15,720
Okay, we'll do it then.

2374
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:16,240
We'll do it.

2375
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:18,240
We'll do it.

2376
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,120
Ha ha ha ha.

2377
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:20,880
Ha ha ha.

2378
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:20,960
Ha ha ha.

2379
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:21,840
Ha ha ha.

2380
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,020
Ha ha ha.

2381
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:23,460
Ha ha.

2382
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:28,920
Okay, I'll do it for you guys.

2383
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:30,220
I'll do it for you guys.

2384
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:35,460
Okay, I'll do it for you guys.

2385
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:44,240
Okay, I'll do it for you guys.

2386
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:52,270
So, aggressive, huh?

2387
02:23:52,270 --> 02:23:55,090
Who she talking to right now?

2388
02:23:55,170 --> 02:23:56,410
They just talk to themselves.

2389
02:23:56,570 --> 02:23:57,550
Like a lot.

2390
02:24:00,770 --> 02:24:01,330
Like...

2391
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:02,190
They're just...

2392
02:24:02,190 --> 02:24:03,230
They're just yappers.

2393
02:24:03,710 --> 02:24:06,030
Girls are just always...

2394
02:24:06,030 --> 02:24:07,970
They have like a...

2395
02:24:07,970 --> 02:24:09,410
invisible audience.

2396
02:24:10,990 --> 02:24:11,490
She's talking to me.

2397
02:24:12,250 --> 02:24:12,550
No?

2398
02:24:12,990 --> 02:24:13,990
She's talking to me.

2399
02:24:17,750 --> 02:24:18,790
She's talking to me.

2400
02:24:26,330 --> 02:24:29,270
Oh no, the sorrow

2401
02:24:41,390 --> 02:24:47,530
She's talking to me She's talking to me She's talking to me

2402
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:11,480
That's crazy.

2403
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:15,540
Alright, I'll fail it, I'll fail it for you guys.

2404
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,600
So that we can see what the bad end looks like.

2405
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:22,780
The jump cut is so funny to me.

2406
02:25:44,150 --> 02:25:45,830
Worst drinker ever award.

2407
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:48,050
No, please!

2408
02:25:49,130 --> 02:25:50,230
No, please.

2409
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:53,030
Uh-oh.

2410
02:25:56,730 --> 02:26:01,490
Next, Alan Wakestream will be Alan and a bunny geeky crew
collecting menus giving changes while drunk.

2411
02:26:02,290 --> 02:26:02,930
Please, God, no.

2412
02:26:07,010 --> 02:26:08,130
She blacked out.

2413
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,830
I'm trying to black out.

2414
02:26:09,230 --> 02:26:09,510
Uh-huh.

2415
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:30,750
Is she gonna, okay, so she, so first we have the first
person with, oh yeah, she's gonna see her own television

2416
02:26:30,750 --> 02:26:31,250
program.

2417
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:31,670
Oh my god.

2418
02:26:32,390 --> 02:26:32,750
Oh no!

2419
02:26:36,510 --> 02:26:38,090
Wait, did Moika see it?

2420
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:39,050
Oh my god, no.

2421
02:26:47,810 --> 02:26:50,750
A proper adult who does not cause a murder.

2422
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:53,710
Well, to be fair, though, that guy was going to murder us.

2423
02:26:54,690 --> 02:26:56,190
We could claim it was self-defense.

2424
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:04,130
I think we can claim self-defense.

2425
02:27:05,210 --> 02:27:07,330
I think we can claim self-defense.

2426
02:27:09,510 --> 02:27:12,170
Kill or be killed in the bunny garden world.

2427
02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:16,570
Yeah, she does look smaller, no?

2428
02:27:16,590 --> 02:27:17,350
Bunny garden?

2429
02:27:17,490 --> 02:27:18,370
Maybe it is different.

2430
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:22,470
Huh?

2431
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:27,550
Handsumo!

2432
02:27:39,630 --> 02:27:41,850
I want to do a handsumo.

2433
02:27:42,430 --> 02:27:43,470
Binary Ghost, thank you for this, everyone.

2434
02:27:43,830 --> 02:27:44,050
Thank you!

2435
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:44,950
Thank you so much.

2436
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:53,550
Oh,

2437
02:27:58,050 --> 02:28:00,370
hand sumo is forbidden outdoors, everybody.

2438
02:28:05,710 --> 02:28:09,070
I think the police officer has the same lines every time.

2439
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:11,630
I just got her to record once.

2440
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:37,690
I thought I gave you water!

2441
02:28:40,330 --> 02:28:41,010
What?

2442
02:28:41,470 --> 02:28:41,590
What?

2443
02:28:47,290 --> 02:28:48,650
Sad music is so funny.

2444
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:57,510
It's just, it seems so like a, it sounds like disappointment
in a musical form.

2445
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:18,750
Was it about dream, Yuka?

2446
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:21,710
Uh-oh.

2447
02:29:21,790 --> 02:29:22,050
Oh.

2448
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:23,370
Oh.

2449
02:29:30,510 --> 02:29:30,970
No.

2450
02:29:35,390 --> 02:29:36,590
She's coping.

2451
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:59,680
Okay, let's read, let's do it now for real.

2452
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:01,980
Okay, let's read, let's do it now for real.

2453
02:30:07,390 --> 02:30:07,790
Okay.

2454
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:15,170
Go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go.

2455
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:16,370
Go-go-go-go-go.

2456
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:17,590
Don't choke.

2457
02:30:18,070 --> 02:30:18,610
Don't choke.

2458
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:20,630
Oh, she choked.

2459
02:30:20,770 --> 02:30:22,390
I do it every time around here.

2460
02:30:22,910 --> 02:30:24,190
Go-go-go-go-go-go.

2461
02:30:24,330 --> 02:30:25,010
You can make it!

2462
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:25,850
No!

2463
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,520
Oh my god, I missed it again.

2464
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:31,600
No stinking way.

2465
02:30:32,020 --> 02:30:33,520
Oh my god, I was right at the end.

2466
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:34,140
Please!

2467
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:37,760
I think we can skip it.

2468
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:47,540
though oh whoops i always forget to press next there okay
skip skip skip skip skip

2469

Good.

2473
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:21,640
I don't...

2474
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:24,480
Do you forget how to drink water if you are...

2475
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:25,340
You're so drunk.

2476
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:27,660
Oh, we did get two super wares, okay?

2477
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:34,720
Wowie, what a swimsuit.

2478
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:36,860
Let's see what we got.

2479
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:39,400
Cute!

2480
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:41,380
The rabbit ones are so cute!

2481
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:44,160
Ooh, standard.

2482
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,520
Okay, low rise for real.

2483
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:52,880
Oh, no, we got a dupes, uh, three star.

2484
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:55,880
Ooh, my princess.

2485
02:31:57,880 --> 02:31:58,960
Gothic devil!

2486
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:00,220
That's good.

2487
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:01,100
That's good.

2488
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:04,880
Lifeline green.

2489
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:06,080
It's okay.

2490
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,220
Calvin Klein.

2491
02:32:08,480 --> 02:32:09,400
I mean, Klayn.

2492
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:09,860
Sorry.

2493
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:13,540
Shimapan!

2494
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:17,740
Oh, but we did get a...

2495
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:18,540
Oh.

2496
02:32:19,420 --> 02:32:21,900
Another seriously same...

2497
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:25,740
We got two of the military ones the same time.

2498
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:29,500
Miyuka, are you okay?

2499
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:34,420
Repeat!

2500
02:32:44,770 --> 02:32:45,510
Nyanyo.

2501
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:46,370
So cute!

2502
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:47,070
Cute!

2503
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:48,850
There's the cat.

2504
02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:52,910
I did wonder if we would get attacked by animals.

2505
02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:54,770
We did get attacked by the bird.

2506
02:32:55,530 --> 02:32:56,590
Oh my god.

2507
02:32:58,170 --> 02:32:58,290
Cute!

2508
02:32:59,530 --> 02:33:00,230
Cute!

2509
02:33:00,230 --> 02:33:02,870
Nyan-Yan-Yan's secret place.

2510
02:33:04,070 --> 02:33:04,570
Blue.

2511
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:11,070
Come on, come, come, come, come, Nyan-Yan.

2512
02:33:11,290 --> 02:33:12,290
Nyan-Yan.

2513
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:13,370
Cute!

2514
02:33:14,330 --> 02:33:15,250
Nyan-Yan!

2515
02:33:16,910 --> 02:33:19,050
Why is the cat making that face?

2516
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:22,630
He's like, he's like, no, I've had enough.

2517
02:33:22,970 --> 02:33:24,630
Like his hand is out and everything.

2518
02:33:24,970 --> 02:33:25,830
He's like,

2519
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:31,250
he's like, no thank you, I'm full.

2520
02:33:36,830 --> 02:33:37,350
No,

2521
02:33:41,150 --> 02:33:41,470
thank you.

2522
02:33:42,170 --> 02:33:42,410
No,

2523
02:33:46,250 --> 02:33:46,930
thank you.

2524
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:54,830
Oh my god!

2525
02:33:55,070 --> 02:33:56,830
Wait, he actually is pushing her away!

2526
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:03,260
Look at him, he's so cute!

2527
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,500
Wait, that's actually so funny!

2528
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:10,820
I didn't know it was a girl.

2529
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:13,960
It's so funny.

2530
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:20,460
It's so funny.

2531
02:34:29,720 --> 02:34:36,140
She's gonna get scratched.

2532
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:37,140
She's gonna get scratched.

2533
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:38,500
Got scratched for you, boy.

2534
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:48,280
Oh my gosh, she's a bad girl.

2535
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:54,320
I don't think I was be sniffing a stray cat.

2536
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:55,560
I'm not gonna lie.

2537
02:34:56,480 --> 02:35:01,740
Like I would pet a stray cat probably because I can't help
myself but I don't think I would be sticking my nose in

2538
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:02,960
there for like that.

2539
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:12,420
Understandable.

2540
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:18,940
Deep reflection.

2541
02:35:26,940 --> 02:35:35,260
Nekosui no She got that Toxma Plasmosis.

2542
02:35:35,260 --> 02:35:37,040
Yeah, yeah, the thing with the cats.

2543
02:35:37,180 --> 02:35:39,100
I think I have that.

2544
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:40,280
I think I have it.

2545
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:41,680
Probably.

2546
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:45,060
My cat sleeps next to my head, so...

2547
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:46,840
Wait,

2548
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:50,740
wait, wait, us?

2549
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:51,580
She's talking to me!

2550
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:53,440
She's talking to us!

2551
02:36:01,220 --> 02:36:03,000
She's talking to eyes!

2552
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:15,580
Don't fall for dog propaganda.

2553
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:17,880
So true, I love cats didn't match.

2554
02:36:31,660 --> 02:36:33,980
Don't cry, don't cry.

2555
02:36:34,220 --> 02:36:34,800
Why are you crying?

2556
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:45,020
What's the last time you caught someone in Ninkumpu?

2557
02:36:55,460 --> 02:36:57,060
Right now?

2558
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:59,540
Last year?

2559
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:06,100
Last Tuesday?

2560
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:07,140
Just yesterday?

2561
02:37:07,900 --> 02:37:10,180
Mint Kampu.

2562
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:11,200
But,

2563
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:23,700
Moeka's and Onei-chan's are important roles.

2564
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:25,440
Thank you, Miu-Ka-chan!

2565
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:43,520
I want to be doated on by an older sibling.

2566
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:47,320
But sadly, my sister does not.

2567
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:53,040
What's the point of having an older sibling if they do not
do it on you?

2568
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:01,000
Let's see.

2569
02:38:02,940 --> 02:38:05,300
I could do the night routine as we've done.

2570
02:38:05,460 --> 02:38:07,880
We'll do the night routine since we did it with all three of
everybody.

2571
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:11,280
And then we could do the second stage.

2572
02:38:15,450 --> 02:38:17,110
She wants to play Goo Goo Babies.

2573
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:18,470
I don't know what that means.

2574
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:21,370
But one time I wanted to play Barbies with my sister and she
wouldn't.

2575
02:38:21,630 --> 02:38:23,190
So I ran up and I bit her.

2576
02:38:23,370 --> 02:38:24,670
And then she started to bleed.

2577
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:30,850
I got a fang after all.

2578
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:41,250
I said, play barbies with me.

2579
02:38:43,050 --> 02:38:45,750
She wouldn't play barbies with me.

2580
02:38:48,850 --> 02:38:50,390
I'm an older sibling.

2581
02:38:50,410 --> 02:38:52,470
I farted on my younger siblings.

2582
02:38:52,470 --> 02:38:57,930
No wonder she doesn't pamper you.

2583
02:38:59,450 --> 02:39:01,750
I'm an older sibling, I farted on my younger siblings.

2584
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:14,080
Have fun with the customers.

2585
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:15,980
Yeah, you should.

2586
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:20,800
Can ghosts have rabies?

2587
02:39:27,420 --> 02:39:28,380
Probably not.

2588
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:33,220
You might get a Minto virus though if I bite you.

2589
02:39:49,220 --> 02:39:51,720
Come on, Miu Kai, you gotta try harder.

2590
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:52,820
You gotta try harder.

2591
02:39:55,100 --> 02:39:58,980
Oh, no, the yoga.

2592
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:01,260
All right, yoga time, everybody.

2593
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:04,280
Yoga, yoga, yoga, yoga, yoga.

2594
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,700
Can I be patient zero?

2595
02:40:14,350 --> 02:40:16,680
I'll do the Barbie whatever after.

2596
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:17,960
It's not that whatever.

2597
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:19,220
It's very important business.

2598
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:25,600
They all do the same.

2599
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:35,820
yoga though oh my god can you imagine going into work the
next day and just being like sorry i'm so sorry that wait i

2600
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:44,920
wonder if you don't succeed in yoga what happens wait
there's a camera control oh oh

2601
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:58,660
You guys, wake up!

2602
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:05,980
You guys, get out of the room!

2603
02:41:07,930 --> 02:41:10,210
That's not boobs!

2604
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:14,630
That's a truck coming your way!

2605
02:41:15,250 --> 02:41:17,990
With high beams on!

2606
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:22,150
Quit being a deer in the headlights!

2607
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:30,350
closer!

2608
02:41:31,470 --> 02:41:34,270
You have to move!

2609
02:41:40,450 --> 02:41:42,470
And you died.

2610
02:41:46,270 --> 02:41:49,050
Do these girls walk?

2611
02:41:49,910 --> 02:41:52,870
How is that breaking a sweat, huh?

2612
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:55,590
Rude to leave your high beams on for incoming cars.

2613
02:41:55,930 --> 02:41:56,230
That's true.

2614
02:41:56,970 --> 02:41:57,930
That is very true.

2615
02:42:02,070 --> 02:42:04,970
Remove all headlights from cars.

2616
02:42:07,990 --> 02:42:10,170
Reminds a scene from Dumb and Dumber movies.

2617
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:11,230
I've never seen that.

2618
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:13,790
She's smelly!

2619
02:42:21,650 --> 02:42:25,330
The lights has placed at 3003135.

2620
02:42:25,490 --> 02:42:28,570
It should say 8008135.

2621
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:29,830
Was that one taken?

2622
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:44,250
How old is Moeka?

2623
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:48,590
She can't wash herself.

2624
02:42:52,530 --> 02:42:59,950
As long as you do your skincare because your skin will get
dry like that.

2625
02:43:00,150 --> 02:43:00,690
Double bath.

2626
02:43:04,410 --> 02:43:04,930
Good!

2627
02:43:07,550 --> 02:43:09,010
Oh my god!

2628
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:11,490
Myuka's back!

2629
02:43:11,630 --> 02:43:12,970
Myuka's back!

2630
02:43:21,150 --> 02:43:22,190
Oh, move?

2631
02:43:23,130 --> 02:43:24,070
No, no.

2632
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:31,490
This is the awkward thing where you and an on-comer are
about to walk into each other but both dodge the same way.

2633
02:43:31,970 --> 02:43:33,170
the easy guy truck

2634
02:43:52,290 --> 02:43:56,470
you guys there's no crack there's no crack

2635
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:30,360
Where'd the auto stop?

2636
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:31,440
Auto.

2637
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:33,540
Hide.

2638
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:37,680
It's very sudsy.

2639
02:44:38,380 --> 02:44:41,960
I was just going, Papa, Papa.

2640
02:44:48,380 --> 02:44:52,360
You know, Maika, how long until you're with me to go to the
bathroom?

2641
02:44:53,700 --> 02:45:00,320
In the middle of the time, I don't know if you'll be like
that, or will you say to me?

2642
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:09,440
I'll go to the bathroom instead of saying something like
that, or something like that.

2643
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:13,960
And then, when you know that I'm a good boy,

2644
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:21,300
No, not allowed.

2645
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:24,840
No,

2646
02:45:28,060 --> 02:45:29,100
please give me your sister.

2647
02:45:32,180 --> 02:45:32,460
No.

2648
02:45:48,790 --> 02:45:49,750
Oh,

2649
02:46:00,150 --> 02:46:00,750
my God.

2650
02:46:04,170 --> 02:46:07,210
So that she never gets a boyfriend.

2651
02:46:08,350 --> 02:46:10,390
So that she never gets a boyfriend.

2652
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:15,950
The foolproof plan.

2653
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:23,170
Good idea, Mioka.

2654
02:46:23,550 --> 02:46:24,130
Good idea.

2655
02:46:24,790 --> 02:46:26,330
Good idea.

2656
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:27,930
Good idea.

2657
02:46:30,310 --> 02:46:30,530
Good idea.

2658
02:46:30,530 --> 02:46:33,670
My kitty mind control.

2659
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:35,230
Oops.

2660
02:46:36,010 --> 02:46:36,070
Oh.

2661
02:46:36,850 --> 02:46:37,610
Because you're tight.

2662
02:46:39,890 --> 02:46:42,610
Before you let it in,

2663
02:46:51,970 --> 02:46:54,150
It is a little annoying.

2664
02:46:54,590 --> 02:46:56,350
It is a little annoying.

2665
02:46:56,350 --> 02:46:57,230
Thank you.

2666
02:47:01,770 --> 02:47:04,450
Everyone's getting influenced by the skincare set.

2667
02:47:08,150 --> 02:47:10,090
Smoother with their hot headlights.

2668
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:11,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2669
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:23,670
I wonder if you fail this, though.

2670
02:47:24,090 --> 02:47:25,930
We'll do an experiment.

2671
02:47:26,090 --> 02:47:28,050
If you fail the skincare, what happens?

2672
02:47:30,550 --> 02:47:33,170
Yuka, you're already beautiful.

2673
02:47:42,610 --> 02:47:42,950
Beautiful!

2674
02:47:46,350 --> 02:47:47,990
The skin melts off.

2675
02:47:48,290 --> 02:47:48,850
Probably.

2676
02:47:49,730 --> 02:47:52,230
Just like the scene in Indiana Jones.

2677
02:47:53,810 --> 02:47:56,670
They just melt into a skeleton.

2678
02:47:58,730 --> 02:47:58,890
Okay.

2679
02:47:59,350 --> 02:48:01,010
Oh wait, this one's not timed!

2680
02:48:01,450 --> 02:48:02,250
Just kidding, okay.

2681
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:04,210
It's only yoga, I guess you can fail.

2682
02:48:13,230 --> 02:48:15,730
Do you guys think I paid too much for this game?

2683
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:20,690
Actually, I love stupid games like this, though.

2684
02:48:21,390 --> 02:48:22,250
Stupid positive.

2685
02:48:22,390 --> 02:48:24,230
Oh, no, you got it in your hair!

2686
02:48:26,670 --> 02:48:26,910
No.

2687
02:48:31,070 --> 02:48:31,550
Skincare.

2688
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:32,610
End.

2689
02:48:36,410 --> 02:48:37,370
Very good.

2690
02:48:37,890 --> 02:48:39,430
Good, good, good, good.

2691
02:48:44,270 --> 02:48:48,110
I'm going to do my skincare like this tonight, everybody.

2692
02:48:54,510 --> 02:48:57,110
Why does it smell bad?

2693
02:48:57,910 --> 02:48:59,870
It shouldn't.

2694
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:00,630
Shake,

2695
02:49:05,330 --> 02:49:06,510
shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

2696
02:49:07,390 --> 02:49:10,790
What is Minto skin routine?

2697
02:49:12,470 --> 02:49:16,170
In the mornings, I...

2698
02:49:16,170 --> 02:49:17,770
In the mornings, I...

2699
02:49:17,770 --> 02:49:20,290
In the mornings, I...

2700
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:21,650
Protruding.

2701
02:49:24,870 --> 02:49:25,830
But...

2702
02:49:25,830 --> 02:49:35,790
I rinse my face, and then I do vitamin C serum, and I do
another, like, hydrating serum, and then I do...

2703
02:49:36,890 --> 02:49:39,890
I do moisturizer.

2704
02:49:40,970 --> 02:49:53,770
and then it's like a light moisturizer and then I do
sunscreen and then at night I do I wash my face and then I

2705
02:49:53,770 --> 02:50:06,550
do the moisturizing serum again and then I do a bit of a
heavier like hydrating serum and then I do what do I do next

2706
02:50:06,550 --> 02:50:14,730
oh I do A bit of a heavier moisturizer.

2707
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:20,420
Yes.

2708
02:50:28,930 --> 02:50:30,210
It's pretty basic.

2709
02:50:31,050 --> 02:50:31,770
Does it get tedious?

2710
02:50:31,990 --> 02:50:32,510
It can.

2711
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:35,970
It can, it can.

2712
02:50:36,370 --> 02:50:40,010
Sometimes I'm just like, I don't want to do it.

2713
02:50:41,850 --> 02:50:43,830
Is that a twice a day thing?

2714
02:50:44,190 --> 02:50:45,310
Morning and night.

2715
02:50:47,010 --> 02:50:47,590
Yeah.

2716
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:51,810
Yeah, it's pretty basic, I think.

2717
02:50:53,010 --> 02:50:58,150
I do have, like, some, like, skincare devices I use, too,
but that's after I put on everything.

2718
02:51:00,770 --> 02:51:02,030
Just don't go out the sun.

2719
02:51:02,190 --> 02:51:03,170
Also, avoid moonlight.

2720
02:51:03,310 --> 02:51:04,050
I am 85.

2721
02:51:04,290 --> 02:51:05,930
I don't look at you for 37.

2722
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:07,250
I believe you.

2723
02:51:09,570 --> 02:51:10,230
Let's see.

2724
02:51:10,390 --> 02:51:11,130
Since all...

2725
02:51:11,130 --> 02:51:13,130
Let's do one more, like, game game.

2726
02:51:15,790 --> 02:51:16,390
Oh, wait.

2727
02:51:16,790 --> 02:51:18,510
We could do a different outfit this time, though.

2728
02:51:22,530 --> 02:51:22,850
Yeah!

2729
02:51:23,930 --> 02:51:24,150
Okay.

2730
02:51:25,170 --> 02:51:26,310
Can I still do stocking?

2731
02:51:27,190 --> 02:51:27,830
It's peak!

2732
02:51:28,270 --> 02:51:30,450
You got... Oh my god, it's so good.

2733
02:51:33,490 --> 02:51:33,810
Okay.

2734
02:51:34,410 --> 02:51:35,250
And then...

2735
02:51:35,250 --> 02:51:36,050
Oh, whoops.

2736
02:51:39,130 --> 02:51:39,770
And then...

2737
02:51:40,530 --> 02:51:40,850
We...

2738
02:51:42,470 --> 02:51:44,510
We'll go do another, like, one in the street.

2739
02:51:45,970 --> 02:51:48,170
Actually, I wonder if I should do...

2740
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:49,530
Rin, though, because it'll be more difficult.

2741
02:51:49,630 --> 02:51:50,070
No, it's okay.

2742
02:51:50,250 --> 02:51:50,710
I'll just do.

2743
02:51:50,810 --> 02:51:51,310
Residence.

2744
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:51,910
Okay.

2745
02:51:52,830 --> 02:51:53,330
Wasted.

2746
02:51:53,870 --> 02:51:54,650
We're wasted.

2747
02:51:55,850 --> 02:51:58,250
Night pool on the streets.

2748
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:07,810
Oh, we get to see a few guys casual.

2749
02:52:12,070 --> 02:52:13,370
Why is she rubbing her hands like that?

2750
02:52:23,150 --> 02:52:24,610
What is she skimming?

2751
02:52:25,530 --> 02:52:27,490
What is she skimming?

2752
02:52:28,250 --> 02:52:30,930
Yeah, where'd the stockings go?

2753
02:52:32,670 --> 02:52:32,810
Hi!

2754
02:52:35,810 --> 02:52:37,570
Look at her abs though!

2755
02:52:39,670 --> 02:52:40,970
Her abs go crazy!

2756
02:52:47,330 --> 02:52:54,610
Wait, if I press R, Oh, okay, just kidding.

2757
02:52:55,310 --> 02:52:56,650
Oh, Arie says display log.

2758
02:52:56,810 --> 02:53:00,050
Sorry, I thought it would be the wind again.

2759
02:53:06,050 --> 02:53:07,010
Oh, so that's why...

2760
02:53:07,010 --> 02:53:08,730
Wait, there's different dialogue for it?

2761
02:53:08,810 --> 02:53:09,450
No way.

2762
02:53:13,710 --> 02:53:15,570
Oh, I wonder if it's scripted.

2763
02:53:15,670 --> 02:53:16,290
That's why.

2764
02:53:17,370 --> 02:53:17,810
Oh.

2765
02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:32,810
Maybe that's why we're not wearing the...

2766
02:53:34,290 --> 02:53:35,090
Stockings.

2767
02:53:36,390 --> 02:53:41,710
But I'm sorry.

2768
02:53:41,710 --> 02:53:45,470
You were supposed to be the designated walker.

2769
02:53:45,470 --> 02:53:45,810
I don't know.

2770
02:53:46,990 --> 02:53:47,810
I'm sorry.

2771
02:53:48,390 --> 02:53:49,790
I'm just a very big one.

2772
02:53:50,050 --> 02:53:51,210
I'm getting my favorite.

2773
02:53:51,210 --> 02:53:55,030
I'm just woken to the other day.

2774
02:53:58,230 --> 02:54:01,390
I'm just a little bit tired.

2775
02:54:02,590 --> 02:54:04,750
I'm just going to go to the party.

2776
02:54:04,750 --> 02:54:05,050
Is it right now?

2777
02:54:05,830 --> 02:54:07,650
Is it a nightclub?

2778
02:54:08,650 --> 02:54:11,470
But if you're too late, I might.

2779
02:54:11,910 --> 02:54:14,010
But if I'm not too much and I'm going to go, then I should
go to another day.

2780
02:54:14,930 --> 02:54:15,450
I think I'll be the next time.

2781
02:54:15,470 --> 02:54:17,390
music makes me want to act silly.

2782
02:54:31,830 --> 02:54:32,430
No,

2783
02:54:35,610 --> 02:54:36,170
don't cry!

2784
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:42,360
She's crying and I'm dancing.

2785
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:47,760
Those are the most crocodile tears ever.

2786
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:48,860
You stop crying immediately.

2787
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:18,260
Let's go home!

2788
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:20,280
Okay.

2789
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,360
Alright, lock-in, everybody.

2790
02:55:24,480 --> 02:55:25,980
Let's go home!

2791
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:27,320
And not explode.

2792
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:28,240
Not explode.

2793
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:29,500
But I'm gonna get those underwear.

2794
02:55:29,780 --> 02:55:30,640
I'm gonna get these panties.

2795
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:31,380
I'm gonna get them.

2796
02:55:32,140 --> 02:55:33,980
Oh my god, the stockings are so good!

2797
02:55:34,220 --> 02:55:34,580
Get it!

2798
02:55:34,780 --> 02:55:36,400
Wait, the stockings are too good!

2799
02:55:39,460 --> 02:55:39,500
Okay.

2800
02:55:39,940 --> 02:55:40,740
So far so good.

2801
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:43,900
So far so good.

2802
02:55:44,840 --> 02:55:45,500
So far so good.

2803
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:47,180
So far so good.

2804
02:55:49,440 --> 02:55:50,120
Densets no?

2805
02:55:51,240 --> 02:55:52,280
No, I don't think so.

2806
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:56,380
They're not the legendary panties of Akihabara,
unfortunately.

2807
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:58,360
Ouch.

2808
02:55:59,940 --> 02:56:02,020
No, you're not gonna force me to go through these.

2809
02:56:02,220 --> 02:56:02,920
Oh my god, please.

2810
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:05,080
Please don't do this to me.

2811
02:56:05,240 --> 02:56:06,240
Please don't do this to me.

2812
02:56:06,380 --> 02:56:06,920
Oh my god, wait.

2813
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:09,760
Oh my god.

2814
02:56:10,220 --> 02:56:10,900
Okay, we got this.

2815
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:11,600
Nice.

2816
02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:12,680
Okay, nice.

2817
02:56:13,420 --> 02:56:13,760
Nice.

2818
02:56:14,140 --> 02:56:19,120
Oh my god, we've been...

2819
02:56:19,140 --> 02:56:19,560
I made it!

2820
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:22,080
Okay.

2821
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:24,800
Why?

2822
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:30,680
Oh my god, that was close to you guys.

2823
02:56:32,520 --> 02:56:35,280
But this is, this is a pretty, pretty smooth run, I'd say.

2824
02:56:35,400 --> 02:56:36,340
We picked wasted, right?

2825
02:56:38,780 --> 02:56:40,580
Hold on, I'm gonna get the panties.

2826
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:43,080
Ouch.

2827
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:44,240
Ouch.

2828
02:56:45,460 --> 02:56:45,580
No!

2829
02:56:47,360 --> 02:56:47,800
Ouch.

2830
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:49,080
No!

2831
02:56:49,140 --> 02:56:49,500
Okay?

2832
02:56:50,680 --> 02:56:51,400
Turn around?

2833
02:56:52,940 --> 02:56:53,660
Flip it around?

2834
02:56:54,220 --> 02:56:55,080
Wicked wits!

2835
02:56:57,100 --> 02:57:00,260
I wonder, let's try going around these, actually.

2836
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:06,120
What if she swings around on the pole?

2837
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:06,920
That'd be crazy.

2838
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:11,600
Wait, can... Oh, there's a... there's a convenience here.

2839
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:14,860
Yeah!

2840
02:57:15,380 --> 02:57:15,880
Destruction!

2841
02:57:19,200 --> 02:57:19,920
Yeah!

2842
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:25,020
Yeah, baby!

2843
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:28,300
Yeah, baby!

2844
02:57:29,260 --> 02:57:30,980
Yeah, baby!

2845
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:32,740
Whoa, I saw inside her head.

2846
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:37,540
There's not a thought behind those eyes, actually.

2847
02:57:39,880 --> 02:57:41,320
Okay, awesome.

2848
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:43,800
Nice.

2849
02:57:45,820 --> 02:57:46,580
Get the!

2850
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:47,180
Get the!

2851
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:49,920
I don't think it's very rare.

2852
02:57:50,060 --> 02:57:51,380
I think it's normal, actually.

2853
02:57:52,380 --> 02:57:53,240
Alright, this way.

2854
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,120
I can't see.

2855
02:57:57,360 --> 02:57:57,580
Okay.

2856
02:57:58,140 --> 02:58:01,580
I don't think I can go across this, that pretty sketchy
looking one.

2857
02:58:02,020 --> 02:58:02,900
It's really thin.

2858
02:58:03,620 --> 02:58:04,680
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2859
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:05,900
Oh god, okay.

2860
02:58:06,260 --> 02:58:08,940
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

2861
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:09,980
Alright, alright.

2862
02:58:09,980 --> 02:58:10,260
No!

2863
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:16,440
Painful.

2864
02:58:20,560 --> 02:58:21,160
No!

2865
02:58:23,240 --> 02:58:23,640
No!

2866
02:58:28,260 --> 02:58:33,820
Yeah, imagine when the owner looks together she sees a girl
in a bathing suit wearing stockings.

2867
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:37,140
Like, going like...

2868
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:38,680
Oh, shoot!

2869
02:58:39,360 --> 02:58:40,140
Oh my god!

2870
02:58:43,460 --> 02:58:47,000
Get soaked by a fire hydrant is an achievement.

2871
02:58:47,160 --> 02:58:47,740
That's crazy.

2872
02:58:51,520 --> 02:58:54,280
Dude, convenience stores in Japan sell pants too.

2873
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:56,140
I think they sell boxers, actually.

2874
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:58,680
Oh my god, please.

2875
02:58:59,040 --> 02:58:59,760
Oh my gosh, please.

2876
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:02,920
Oh my god.

2877
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:04,600
Oh my god, please.

2878
02:59:05,220 --> 02:59:05,820
You got this?

2879
02:59:06,580 --> 02:59:07,180
You got this?

2880
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:07,860
Please.

2881
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:09,080
It's scary.

2882
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:11,060
It's too scary.

2883
02:59:11,180 --> 02:59:12,100
Oh, okay, we got this.

2884
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:13,500
Nice guys, good job.

2885
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:16,580
Let's see.

2886
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:29,620
to decide which way i want to go uh let's try to just go and
wait i could go around it maybe let me just not explode

2887
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:50,980

02:59:51,480 --> 02:59:51,720
Don't explode!

2890
02:59:52,060 --> 02:59:53,160
Okay, that was close.

2891
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:55,120
Ah!

2892
02:59:56,740 --> 02:59:57,680
I got greedy.

2893
03:00:00,100 --> 03:00:00,580
No!

2894
03:00:05,300 --> 03:00:06,660
But we got it.

2895
03:00:08,040 --> 03:00:09,220
We got that one.

2896
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:11,040
I don't have to try again, I suppose.

2897
03:00:11,780 --> 03:00:12,580
Was it worth it?

2898
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:13,060
Maybe.

2899
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:17,940
Okay.

2900
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:28,140
I wonder what other things you can hit, then that gives you,
like, special...

2901
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:29,700
Oh my god.

2902
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:31,000
Oh my god, please!

2903
03:00:31,460 --> 03:00:33,400
Oh, it's so it's so it's so...

2904
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:34,600
Oh, that was scary for real.

2905
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:35,620
Okay.

2906
03:00:36,240 --> 03:00:36,560
Please.

2907
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:38,120
I need you to focus.

2908
03:00:38,840 --> 03:00:39,120
Please.

2909
03:00:39,720 --> 03:00:39,940
Ren.

2910
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:42,020
Ren, please focus!

2911
03:00:47,320 --> 03:00:49,120
You heard those pretty lines.

2912
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:51,080
Okay,

2913
03:01:00,130 --> 03:01:00,470
please.

2914
03:01:03,390 --> 03:01:04,590
Yeah, super yabai.

2915
03:01:05,270 --> 03:01:05,870
Super yabai.

2916
03:01:06,490 --> 03:01:07,930
Are you kidding me?

2917
03:01:08,350 --> 03:01:09,070
Oh my god.

2918
03:01:10,190 --> 03:01:11,310
Oh, so dang!

2919
03:01:12,930 --> 03:01:14,570
She died, for real!

2920
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:26,760
I don't think you're gun-bottowing enough, Rin.

2921
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:28,060
I think you're...

2922
03:01:28,980 --> 03:01:30,840
You're not taking this very seriously.

2923
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:33,000
Drowned in way.

2924
03:01:33,020 --> 03:01:35,180
concrete actually though.

2925
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:39,580
All

2926
03:01:46,130 --> 03:01:46,590
right.

2927
03:01:47,230 --> 03:01:48,890
Heat it up, heat it up, heat it up.

2928
03:01:49,330 --> 03:01:50,410
And okay.

2929
03:01:51,190 --> 03:01:54,630
Heat it up, heat it up, heat it up.

2930
03:01:54,910 --> 03:01:55,590
Oh no no no!

2931
03:01:57,110 --> 03:01:58,590
I was trying to turn her.

2932
03:01:59,790 --> 03:01:59,910
Oh.

2933
03:02:00,810 --> 03:02:00,990
Oh.

2934
03:02:02,270 --> 03:02:04,510
Guys, this is pretty tough.

2935
03:02:05,250 --> 03:02:06,210
This is pretty tough.

2936
03:02:07,850 --> 03:02:09,450
Come on Rin, I need you to focus.

2937
03:02:09,570 --> 03:02:09,910
Girl!

2938
03:02:12,310 --> 03:02:13,030
No!

2939
03:02:13,490 --> 03:02:15,190
I need you to focus for real!

2940
03:02:16,530 --> 03:02:17,450
Pour the concrete.

2941
03:02:20,110 --> 03:02:28,690
Oh, it's Rin's unlucky day because in the morning comes the
team that's going to pour in the concrete here and they're a

2942
03:02:28,690 --> 03:02:37,290
team they call Never Look Twice because they'll never look
to make sure that it's that it's empty.

2943
03:02:37,290 --> 03:02:47,170
They only notoriously look once Because they think that
they'll get the job done right in the first try Oh my god,

2944
03:02:47,230 --> 03:02:51,150
please And so, Rin will die

2945
03:02:54,790 --> 03:02:58,870
She's already wearing a swimsuit and then takes damage What
does she lose?

2946
03:02:59,850 --> 03:03:06,130
That's a great question That's a great question, let's test
it

2947
03:03:11,220 --> 03:03:13,920
All right, just a little bit more.

2948
03:03:16,520 --> 03:03:16,900
No!

2949
03:03:22,890 --> 03:03:23,270
No!

2950
03:03:25,350 --> 03:03:26,110
Oh,

2951
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:39,560
our heat is going crazy.

2952
03:03:40,980 --> 03:03:43,220
I wish I could just go through these.

2953
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:44,520
But unfortunately...

2954
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:44,640
Oh.

2955
03:03:45,900 --> 03:03:57,820
you can't you just take a bunch of damage oh gosh okay i was
just gonna test it but i guess not okay all right you got

2956
03:03:57,820 --> 03:04:06,180

gosh no no no no

2957
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:18,460
make sure there's nothing behind me too.

2958
03:04:19,500 --> 03:04:22,260
No hidden Ponsu behind me?

2959
03:04:25,020 --> 03:04:31,320
Bridges and Dems are haunted because if someone fell into a
support while it was being poured, we could not stop the

2960
03:04:31,320 --> 03:04:32,260
poor to save them.

2961
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:33,920
It's true.

2962
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:35,860
It's true.

2963
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:39,340
Oh my god.

2964
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:40,240
Wait, we're going crazy.

2965
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:44,240

2967
03:04:47,840 --> 03:04:48,580
Please, no!

2968
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:50,060
I need you to focus!

2969
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:51,380
Ran, I need you to focus!

2970
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:52,860
I need you to focus!

2971
03:04:53,280 --> 03:04:53,740
Come on.

2972
03:04:54,820 --> 03:04:55,300
You do,

2973
03:04:58,560 --> 03:04:59,200
yeah...

2974
03:05:00,520 --> 03:05:02,020
You do seem like you're gonna fall.

2975
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:02,800
It's okay now.

2976
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:08,520
Okay, now.

2977
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:09,960
Okay, I'm not gonna...

2978
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:11,760
Okay, alright, we're gonna...

2979
03:05:11,760 --> 03:05:13,380
We just gotta get through this part, you guys.

2980
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:15,600
We just gotta get through this one part!

2981
03:05:44,190 --> 03:05:46,650
That's gore of my comfort character.

2982
03:05:48,670 --> 03:05:49,610
Come on.

2983
03:05:53,070 --> 03:05:54,030
This way?

2984
03:05:54,630 --> 03:05:55,530
You're okay.

2985
03:05:57,110 --> 03:05:58,870
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2986
03:05:59,910 --> 03:06:00,230
Sorry.

2987
03:06:01,190 --> 03:06:01,670
Oh, okay.

2988
03:06:02,330 --> 03:06:03,650
Alright, this way?

2989
03:06:06,710 --> 03:06:08,070
We're collecting damage.

2990
03:06:08,290 --> 03:06:08,670
That's okay.

2991
03:06:12,090 --> 03:06:12,570
Hitbox.

2992
03:06:12,730 --> 03:06:14,130
It's because she's wearing heels.

2993
03:06:15,270 --> 03:06:17,150
Ma'am, I need you to take those off.

2994
03:06:17,870 --> 03:06:20,430
You know, there's, um, if you wear, like, heels.

2995
03:06:21,230 --> 03:06:21,590
Oh my god.

2996
03:06:22,190 --> 03:06:23,030
Turn around!

2997
03:06:25,410 --> 03:06:34,810
Um, there's like, uh, there's like foldable shoes that you
can buy for when your feet get tired of wearing heels.

2998
03:06:35,510 --> 03:06:40,170
So you can just like, just pull them out of your bag and be
like, okay.

2999
03:06:42,490 --> 03:06:45,050
This is the final boss level for Halo.

3000
03:06:53,800 --> 03:06:55,740
I couldn't line it up.

3001
03:06:57,780 --> 03:06:58,520
for the concrete.

3002
03:06:58,720 --> 03:07:01,460
She wants to eat concrete so stinkin' by it.

3003
03:07:03,500 --> 03:07:05,320
I don't know if we should Zen-Lyoku dash.

3004
03:07:05,500 --> 03:07:07,280
I think we should take it nice and easy.

3005
03:07:07,800 --> 03:07:08,580
Okay, yeah.

3006
03:07:11,180 --> 03:07:11,580
Wasted.

3007
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:14,800
Oh my god.

3008
03:07:15,260 --> 03:07:16,540
I can't believe I avoided that box.

3009
03:07:17,300 --> 03:07:17,600
Never mind.

3010
03:07:17,920 --> 03:07:18,260
Just kidding.

3011
03:07:19,860 --> 03:07:21,920
I ate my words.

3012
03:07:23,100 --> 03:07:25,340
Heals can help you run from T-Rex's.

3013
03:07:25,820 --> 03:07:26,680
What is that from?

3014
03:07:26,800 --> 03:07:28,180
Okay, I gotta, I'm gonna Rock in.

3015
03:07:30,100 --> 03:07:30,360
Please.

3016
03:07:33,620 --> 03:07:35,600
I need- No, no, why are you turning around?

3017
03:07:35,980 --> 03:07:36,760
Why are you turning around?

3018
03:07:36,980 --> 03:07:37,860
No, oh my god.

3019
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:39,200
That almost exploded.

3020
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:40,540
Holy cow.

3021
03:07:40,720 --> 03:07:41,900
That would have been so bad.

3022
03:07:42,800 --> 03:07:43,820
Okay, come on.

3023
03:07:43,940 --> 03:07:44,340
Forward.

3024
03:07:44,800 --> 03:07:45,380
Forward, Rin.

3025
03:07:45,660 --> 03:07:46,080
Please.

3026
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:48,520
No, no, don't fall, please.

3027
03:07:48,880 --> 03:07:49,220
Don't fall.

3028
03:07:49,780 --> 03:07:50,020
Please.

3029
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:51,180
Don't watch yourself.

3030
03:07:51,640 --> 03:07:52,940
Why did you turn around?

3031
03:08:07,960 --> 03:08:09,740
I'm gonna have a cough drop.

3032
03:08:12,340 --> 03:08:13,260
And then...

3033
03:08:13,260 --> 03:08:14,660
Why did you turn around?

3034
03:08:15,040 --> 03:08:16,020
Why did you turn around?

3035
03:08:20,100 --> 03:08:22,300
I just want to go home, honestly.

3036
03:08:24,980 --> 03:08:27,560
This game is making it hard for me to love them.

3037
03:08:29,820 --> 03:08:31,480
I don't think I love you anymore.

3038
03:08:36,580 --> 03:08:37,560
Why did you turn around?

3039
03:08:37,680 --> 03:08:38,240
Why did you do that?

3040
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:39,080
Why did you do that?

3041
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:41,560
Jurassic World got made fun of a lot for you.

3042
03:08:41,780 --> 03:08:42,120
Oh, really?

3043
03:08:44,360 --> 03:08:45,000
Oh, gosh.

3044
03:08:45,160 --> 03:08:45,360
Oh, gosh.

3045
03:08:45,660 --> 03:08:45,660
Okay.

3046
03:08:45,860 --> 03:08:46,060
Alright.

3047
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:46,540
Alright.

3048
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:47,200
Come on.

3049
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:47,560
Come on.

3050
03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:48,260
Yeah.

3051
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:49,120
Come on.

3052
03:08:50,380 --> 03:08:51,300
One step forward.

3053
03:08:51,320 --> 03:08:52,000
One foot forward.

3054
03:08:52,720 --> 03:08:53,380
One foot forward.

3055
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:53,940
No, please.

3056
03:08:54,280 --> 03:08:54,380
Please.

3057
03:08:54,520 --> 03:08:54,520
Please.

3058
03:08:54,740 --> 03:08:54,980
God, please.

3059
03:08:55,680 --> 03:08:56,880
God, please, please.

3060
03:08:57,280 --> 03:08:58,160
I will- I'm a good ghost.

3061
03:08:58,420 --> 03:08:58,720
I promise.

3062
03:08:59,200 --> 03:08:59,740
I promise.

3063
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:01,120
Oh my god.

3064
03:09:01,380 --> 03:09:01,380
Yeah.

3065
03:09:02,120 --> 03:09:03,900
Okay, we're- We're shimmying.

3066
03:09:03,960 --> 03:09:05,760
We're shimmying through it.

3067
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:07,500
We're shimmying through it!

3068
03:09:07,700 --> 03:09:07,900
Yeah!

3069
03:09:16,190 --> 03:09:16,710
Ouch!

3070
03:09:16,970 --> 03:09:19,090
I thought you meant ouchi.

3071
03:09:19,370 --> 03:09:20,490
I thought you meant ouchi.

3072
03:09:21,350 --> 03:09:22,110
ouchi, ouchi!

3073
03:09:22,350 --> 03:09:22,630
ouchi!

3074
03:09:22,630 --> 03:09:28,650
I wish there was another way to get through this.

3075
03:09:29,770 --> 03:09:31,790
They're like, you're gonna get good at this game.

3076
03:09:32,410 --> 03:09:34,170
Or you'll never make it through.

3077
03:09:36,250 --> 03:09:38,070
We tank it, we tank these.

3078
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:39,590
We tank these.

3079
03:09:41,230 --> 03:09:42,990
We tank these.

3080
03:09:43,810 --> 03:09:44,730
We tank these.

3081
03:09:47,690 --> 03:09:47,990
Please.

3082
03:09:48,310 --> 03:09:48,910
We shimmy through.

3083
03:09:49,690 --> 03:09:50,350
We shimmy through.

3084
03:09:50,730 --> 03:09:51,750
We shimmy through.

3085
03:09:52,050 --> 03:09:52,410
Oh my god.

3086
03:09:52,630 --> 03:09:53,130
We shimmy through.

3087
03:09:53,770 --> 03:09:54,530
We shimmy through.

3088
03:09:55,150 --> 03:09:55,690
We shimmy through.

3089
03:09:55,990 --> 03:09:56,170
Okay.

3090
03:09:57,670 --> 03:09:57,870
Okay.

3091
03:09:58,010 --> 03:09:58,110
Oh!

3092
03:09:59,110 --> 03:10:00,430
Okay, all right.

3093
03:10:00,590 --> 03:10:03,490
No, okay, we can avoid that one at least.

3094
03:10:03,770 --> 03:10:04,970
I see the goal!

3095
03:10:07,030 --> 03:10:07,550
Okay.

3096
03:10:11,350 --> 03:10:11,910
Oh my god.

3097
03:10:13,290 --> 03:10:14,810
No, no, why are you gonna turn him out?

3098
03:10:15,490 --> 03:10:16,510
Okay, we're fine.

3099
03:10:16,790 --> 03:10:17,270
Just kidding.

3100
03:10:20,710 --> 03:10:21,230
Sorry.

3101
03:10:23,610 --> 03:10:24,130
Sorry.

3102
03:10:38,220 --> 03:10:38,980
I'm fine?

3103
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:39,860
I'm normal?

3104
03:10:42,340 --> 03:10:43,140
Everything's good?

3105
03:10:45,800 --> 03:10:46,200
Okay.

3106
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:47,440
Ouch!

3107
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:48,240
Ouch!

3108
03:10:48,880 --> 03:10:49,020
Ouch!

3109
03:10:50,280 --> 03:10:50,680
Okay.

3110
03:10:51,080 --> 03:10:52,880
This one I think we can go around too.

3111
03:10:54,300 --> 03:10:55,180
It's not worth it.

3112
03:10:56,020 --> 03:10:56,900
It's not worth it.

3113
03:10:57,120 --> 03:10:57,820
It's not worth it.

3114
03:10:58,580 --> 03:10:59,440
It's not worth it.

3115
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:00,200
It's not worth it.

3116
03:11:00,300 --> 03:11:00,840
It's not worth it.

3117
03:11:00,940 --> 03:11:01,440
It's not worth it.

3118
03:11:01,540 --> 03:11:01,840
It's not worth it.

3119
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:03,120
I'll chat, I'll chat, I'll chat.

3120
03:11:03,480 --> 03:11:03,700
It's okay.

3121
03:11:04,060 --> 03:11:04,440
It's okay.

3122
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:05,180
Goal.

3123
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:05,960
Goal.

3124
03:11:06,500 --> 03:11:07,260
Just get to the goal.

3125
03:11:07,980 --> 03:11:08,000
Yes.

3126
03:11:30,330 --> 03:11:31,450
Her butt is stuck!

3127
03:11:35,010 --> 03:11:36,090
Good job, Mido.

3128
03:11:36,330 --> 03:11:36,890
Thank you!

3129
03:11:37,610 --> 03:11:38,350
Congrats on walking.

3130
03:11:40,630 --> 03:11:42,730
It's my first day on Earth!

3131
03:11:47,870 --> 03:11:50,430
She's like, it'd be so bad if someone saw me like this.

3132
03:11:50,730 --> 03:11:54,030
But it'd also be so bad if the construction workers came
back and started pouring.

3133
03:11:54,090 --> 03:11:55,090
the concrete.

3134
03:12:10,850 --> 03:12:15,430
Wait, so this is a different...

3135
03:12:16,230 --> 03:12:18,530
This should be a different game then, right?

3136
03:12:18,650 --> 03:12:19,930
Or the different minigame.

3137
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:35,180
This game making Dark Souls look like a baby game.

3138
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:37,780
Your butt got stuck in a manhole!

3139
03:12:41,650 --> 03:12:43,510
I gotta shake my body and escape.

3140
03:12:44,630 --> 03:12:45,050
Obviously.

3141
03:12:49,350 --> 03:12:52,850
By pressing the button displayed until the gauge disappears,
you may shake your body.

3142
03:12:53,450 --> 03:12:56,130
Upon shaking your body enough and escaping, you will clear
the game.

3143
03:12:59,710 --> 03:13:00,170
Oh, please.

3144
03:13:00,330 --> 03:13:01,470
You can't get out of that.

3145
03:13:05,270 --> 03:13:07,050
I want to know how... Oh, wait.

3146
03:13:08,490 --> 03:13:16,570
Oh, I want to know how the, like, meeting for this, you
know, like, how do we do this mini-game?

3147
03:13:22,960 --> 03:13:24,540
Look at her face.

3148
03:13:24,760 --> 03:13:25,080
Oh, whoops.

3149
03:13:25,580 --> 03:13:25,980
Oh, whoops.

3150
03:13:29,860 --> 03:13:31,220
Oh, they're getting fast.

3151
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:33,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3152
03:13:46,150 --> 03:13:48,310
No way, full combo!

3153
03:13:48,650 --> 03:13:51,770
Oh, I wonder because I didn't fail this time, I got an S.

3154
03:13:53,970 --> 03:13:54,290
Whoa!

3155
03:13:56,690 --> 03:13:57,970
Everyday clothes.

3156
03:13:59,910 --> 03:14:01,010
Let's see what panties we get.

3157
03:14:01,350 --> 03:14:04,150
Oh, wow, passionate rose.

3158
03:14:07,170 --> 03:14:08,370
Pure strawberry!

3159
03:14:09,230 --> 03:14:11,070
Her butt is nowhere big enough to be stuck in them.

3160
03:14:11,150 --> 03:14:11,630
I know!

3161
03:14:13,510 --> 03:14:16,730
She just wants to be held, okay guys?

3162
03:14:17,570 --> 03:14:19,890
Rabbit whiskers are so cute!

3163
03:14:23,520 --> 03:14:25,520
Gothic devil purple.

3164
03:14:26,900 --> 03:14:27,800
Very cute!

3165
03:14:33,820 --> 03:14:35,360
No Rin, don't jump!

3166
03:14:35,500 --> 03:14:36,160
It's concrete!

3167
03:14:51,700 --> 03:14:52,740
What's dripping?

3168
03:14:53,300 --> 03:14:54,740
I guess from the pool?

3169
03:14:55,740 --> 03:14:56,200
The concrete.

3170
03:14:56,500 --> 03:14:58,480
The concrete's dripping.

3171
03:15:07,470 --> 03:15:08,470
Oh, okay.

3172
03:15:08,790 --> 03:15:09,910
She's in a kitty pool.

3173
03:15:11,850 --> 03:15:13,050
So then it'll be safe.

3174
03:15:13,050 --> 03:15:14,830
Yeah, guys, don't drink and swim, okay?

3175
03:15:14,950 --> 03:15:15,710
It's dangerous.

3176
03:15:15,830 --> 03:15:20,550
Don't drink and swim!

3177
03:15:21,750 --> 03:15:23,210
You should go into a kitty pool.

3178
03:15:31,650 --> 03:15:32,870
Yeah, wait, only 50%?

3179
03:15:38,570 --> 03:15:40,870
What if you're swimming in alcohol though?

3180
03:15:40,870 --> 03:15:44,910
You can swim in piles of money like your Scrooge McDuck.

3181
03:15:45,590 --> 03:15:46,870
That's the only time.

3182
03:15:48,070 --> 03:15:50,050
Morrow, thank you so much for the five gift.

3183
03:15:50,210 --> 03:15:51,870
Thank you.

3184
03:15:53,050 --> 03:15:53,930
Thank you, thank you.

3185
03:15:54,090 --> 03:15:58,910
What do you think?

3186
03:15:59,990 --> 03:16:01,070
Wait, do we get a CG?

3187
03:16:04,090 --> 03:16:06,870
She's gonna drag her in.

3188
03:16:07,890 --> 03:16:09,510
Hot tub stream on balcony.

3189
03:16:11,230 --> 03:16:11,870
What?

3190
03:16:12,890 --> 03:16:12,970
What?

3191
03:16:19,870 --> 03:16:21,710
Step construction work, I'm sorry.

3192
03:16:34,630 --> 03:16:35,910
That's okay.

3193
03:16:36,410 --> 03:16:40,090
Imagine you come across two girls in a kitty pool in the
middle of an alleyway.

3194
03:16:40,090 --> 03:16:51,930
I don't think that's what I don't I mean that's a nice thing
to say but I don't think that applies here like I'm

3195
03:16:51,930 --> 03:16:58,070
beautiful so you don't need a bathing suit what's that mean
unless she's asking her to be naked

3196
03:17:05,390 --> 03:17:06,470
goodbye organs

3197
03:17:12,490 --> 03:17:17,670
Maybe I'll do it one day so that you guys can be like, oh my
god, you'll never guess what happened to me.

3198
03:17:18,110 --> 03:17:21,270
I was walking down an alleyway and I saw a girl swimming in
a kitty pool.

3199
03:17:24,070 --> 03:17:24,510
Oh,

3200
03:17:34,260 --> 03:17:34,360
what?

3201
03:17:34,480 --> 03:17:35,060
No CG.

3202
03:17:36,440 --> 03:17:36,600
Really?

3203
03:17:38,700 --> 03:17:42,120
Stingy game, stingy game, stingy game.

3204
03:17:48,780 --> 03:18:03,800
alleyway is haunted there's a ghost swimming here well guys
um this game was fun wasn't it there's still so many outfits

3205
03:18:03,800 --> 03:18:15,700
unlock maybe why is she crying this one's cute though this
is a cute pose me too

3206
03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:22,620
I wonder how tall she is.

3207
03:18:22,740 --> 03:18:23,700
Probably, we're about...

3208
03:18:23,700 --> 03:18:24,780
Probably, like, maybe...

3209
03:18:24,780 --> 03:18:25,220
I don't know.

3210
03:18:26,500 --> 03:18:28,400
I don't know how tall she is.

3211
03:18:28,800 --> 03:18:30,160
Do you think we're about the same height?

3212
03:18:30,340 --> 03:18:30,600
Maybe...

3213
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:31,800
She seems tall, though, right?

3214
03:18:33,420 --> 03:18:33,700
Hey!

3215
03:18:37,720 --> 03:18:39,460
Wait, I want her in her actual outfit.

3216
03:18:42,220 --> 03:18:43,900
Wait, then change the pose.

3217
03:18:59,070 --> 03:19:02,430
Oh wait, I feel like taller.

3218
03:19:02,610 --> 03:19:04,330
Well, she's wearing heels right now, so.

3219
03:19:05,810 --> 03:19:07,190
Wait, did she actually get taller?

3220
03:19:09,470 --> 03:19:09,830
Wow!

3221
03:19:10,570 --> 03:19:12,870
I think she actually got taller because of the heels.

3222
03:19:13,090 --> 03:19:14,270
Wait, unless she was in heels before.

3223
03:19:14,350 --> 03:19:15,370
Let's see what other pose that we got.

3224
03:19:17,010 --> 03:19:18,090
You're walking in the street.

3225
03:19:18,250 --> 03:19:19,890
There's no one around and your phone is dead.

3226
03:19:20,330 --> 03:19:21,770
Out of the corner of your eye.

3227
03:19:21,930 --> 03:19:22,070
Ah!

3228
03:19:26,530 --> 03:19:30,350
Is it because I'm a ghost?

3229
03:19:33,310 --> 03:19:34,530
This is cute pose too.

3230
03:19:34,810 --> 03:19:35,310
Oh, there we go.

3231
03:19:37,250 --> 03:19:37,970
Wait, sorry.

3232
03:19:39,910 --> 03:19:40,370
There we go.

3233
03:19:40,530 --> 03:19:41,510
I want to look at me now.

3234
03:19:52,040 --> 03:19:53,700
Wait, I can do something else too.

3235
03:19:54,100 --> 03:19:54,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3236
03:19:54,940 --> 03:19:55,960
I might be a genius.

3237
03:19:56,440 --> 03:19:58,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3238
03:19:58,040 --> 03:19:59,120
I might be a genius!

3239
03:19:59,500 --> 03:20:03,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait.

3240
03:20:03,540 --> 03:20:04,520
I forgot to do this.

3241
03:20:05,020 --> 03:20:05,560
Wait, wait, wait.

3242
03:20:06,360 --> 03:20:07,160
Let's see.

3243
03:20:08,600 --> 03:20:08,940
Oh, wait.

3244
03:20:08,940 --> 03:20:14,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh… Uh, over here.

3245
03:20:18,800 --> 03:20:21,500
Now I'm really in there with...

3246
03:20:22,040 --> 03:20:24,960
The lighting is simpler even.

3247
03:20:28,300 --> 03:20:31,000
This is sooo!

3248
03:20:44,140 --> 03:20:49,820
Women, am I right?

3249
03:20:51,640 --> 03:20:52,100
Positive.

3250
