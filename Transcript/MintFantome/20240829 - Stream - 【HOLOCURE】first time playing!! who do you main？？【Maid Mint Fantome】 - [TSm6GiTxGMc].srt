00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,860
Hello!

2
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,380
Welcome back, Master!

3
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,940
Oh, Master!

4
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,020
Welcome!

5
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,500
Oh, Minto.

6
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,380
Hello.

7
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,720
Hello, Minto.

8
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,540
Hello!

9
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,940
Hi, Mint!

10
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,520
Hi!

11
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,960
Sorry if I sound extra... nasally today.

12
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:24,340
I don't know, my... my... my... throat... no, my nose... is extra... extra nasally.

13
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,080
Actually, I have some cough drops.

14
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,200
Maybe I should take them.

15
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,920
Oh,

16
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,580
what nose?

17
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,860
Darn sinus.

18
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,560
I know!

19
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,640
Hope it's not Rona.

20
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,220
I don't think so.

21
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,560
Because...

22
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,340
I think it's just a cold.

23
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,400
I think I got a cold from overworking myself.

24
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,760
But also, I don't think it's Rona because... I haven't really been like... out.

25
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:03,960
I like... have kind of... the day... the day before I started feeling bad, I... all I did was take a walk outside.

26
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,740
But I walked for a long time, so...

27
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,860
Did you see Matoya?

28
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,180
Yeah!

29
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,480
We hung out last night!

30
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,520
Oh, again!

31
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:23,200
Sorry, I meant to say... I wanted to apologize for... for moving the time.

32
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,660
If you're watching the VOD of this, thank you!

33
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,580
But... if you are watching it live, thank you!

34
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,960
No, no!

35
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,760
Thanks for the perk!

36
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,380
WiseSage1 said, your oshi is the light of your life, so investing in them is just utility bills.

37
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,540
This goes towards your oshi.

38
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,680
Thank you!

39
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,560
Some extra holo coins to start with.

40
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,780
No, may not be transferable to Holocure.

41
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,880
Ken used his regular dollars and said, thank you!

42
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,920
Thanks for the super chat, you guys.

43
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,320
Yeah, so I'm sorry that I had to move the time.

44
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,020
I've... I've booked a little bit of some stuff.

45
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
And that's my fault.

46
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,700
So I'm really sorry about that.

47
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,100
But I didn't want to cancel the stream.

48
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,160
So I was like, I'll just push it a little bit.

49
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,460
But yeah, howdy, man.

50
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,280
Howdy!

51
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,960
I just cried for a maid yesterday.

52
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,600
I know!

53
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,360
Oh my gosh.

54
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,440
Yeah, it was like... yeah.

55
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,840
I was watching too.

56
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,700
And... um...

57
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
You know, I never was a super active watcher.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
But she was one of the members I was subscribed to.

59
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
And... um...

60
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,420
You know, I really loved Aqua's performance.

61
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,140
Like, she was a true idol.

62
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,980
She is a true idol, you know.

63
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,060
So... um... I really was happy I could watch her graduation.

64
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,300
Um...

65
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,100
But when she played the one song...

66
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,880
I really like her one song.

67
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,200
Oh my gosh, I can't remember the full name.

68
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,380
The Desha one.

69
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,080
Um...

70
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,700
But...

71
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,100
Um...

72
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,580
What's it called?

73
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,520
My brain.

74
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,600
Sorry, I have a...

75
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,240
I have...

76
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
Sick brain.

77
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,840
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

78
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,080
When that one played.

79
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,440
It's my favorite of her songs.

80
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,640
So I was like...

81
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,480
That was so...

82
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,940
It was so...

83
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,240
But yeah...

84
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
Um...

85
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,080
Anyway...

86
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,820
It's okay.

87
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,280
Because...

88
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,180
Um...

89
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,720
You know...

90
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,620
As...

91
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,940
As one says...

92
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,940
Don't take your Oshii for granted.

93
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:52,940
And...

94
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,060
Appreciate the time you have with your Oshii.

95
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,360
And...

96
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,120
You know...

97
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,300
Just enjoy...

98
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,640
Idols.

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,900
Just enjoy...

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,440
Vtuber.

101
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,820
Just have fun with it.

102
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,520
You know?

103
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,600
And enjoy...

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,280
And have fun with the time...

105
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,900
That...

106
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,820
Uh...

107
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,660
We can all hang out and have fun together.

108
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,540
Yeah.

109
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,020
So...

110
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,820
You know...

111
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,300
I'm...

112
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,120
Uh...

113
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,340
I think it's grown more recently.

114
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,220
I used to say...

115
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,620
Like...

116
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,700
I'm no...

117
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,280
Um...

118
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm no...

119
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,140
Uh...

120
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,920
What's the word?

121
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,660
Newbie?

122
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,060
I'm no newbie to graduation.

123
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,940
Since I've been into idols for...

124
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,240
Over a decade now.

125
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,420
So...

126
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:35,980
But...

127
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,600
I use...

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,540
And I used to say...

129
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,320
That maybe...

130
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,640
It wasn't as common in the Vtubes.

131
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,720
But...

132
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,760
I think more recently...

133
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,640
It's kind of grown...

134
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,160
A little bit more common...

135
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,120
To have...

136
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,740
More people...

137
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,340
Uh...

138
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,860
Graduating.

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,060
So...

140
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,420
Um...

141
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,760
But...

142
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:51,980
Uh...

143
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,640
You know...

144
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,340
And it doesn't...

145
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,780
For me...

146
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,440
It doesn't get easier.

147
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,540
But it...

148
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,760
Um...

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
You know...

150
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,920
Uh...

151
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,600
It does...

152
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
The more...

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,740
The more it happens...

154
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,720
The more I do...

155
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,340
Uh...

156
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,660
Tend to appreciate...

157
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,440
Um...

158
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,980
The people that I...

159
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,720
You know...

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
Support and follow...

161
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,740
That much more.

162
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,460
So...

163
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,740
Uh...

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,980
Yeah...

165
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,160
Yeah...

166
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah...

167
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,160
Hahaha...

168
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,380
Uh...

169
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,440
But...

170
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
Today...

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
We are...

172
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,260
Playing...

173
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,000
Holocure...

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,080
This is actually...

175
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,440
I know...

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,480
It's very strange...

177
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,400
For me...

178
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,340
To not have played this before...

179
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,960
But...

180
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,740
But...

181
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,180
But...

182
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,400
To my credit...

183
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,060
I...

184
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,420
Didn't...

185
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,420
Okay...

186
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,320
So...

187
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,840
I...

188
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,800
Wasn't sure...

189
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,080
If I would like...

190
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,440
Vampire Survivors...

191
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,100
You know?

192
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,780
And...

193
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,040
I was like...

194
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,680
I...

195
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,400
I thought...

196
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,180
That the...

197
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,100
That the gameplay...

198
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,640
Wasn't really my style...

199
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,680
Like I was just like...

200
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,980
Ah...

201
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,320
I don't...

202
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,660
I don't really know...

203
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,500
And then I got like...

204
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,920
Addicted to this one game...

205
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,580
It wasn't Vampire Survivors...

206
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,340
But it was like...

207
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,760
A mobile clone...

208
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,180
Basic...

209
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,760
Not a clone...

210
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,220
But you know...

211
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,080
Mobile style...

212
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,460
It was...

213
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,180
It's called like...

214
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
Survivor.io...

215
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,460
Or something...

216
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,680
You know?

217
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,560
And I...

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
I like...

219
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Sunk my tooth into that...

220
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,400
I was like...

221
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,160
Wow...

222
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,180
My god...

223
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,220
Have fun with the game...

224
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,520
My main is Sui-chan...

225
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
But I hope you find a character...

226
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,220
That vibes with you...

227
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,140
Thank you...

228
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,540
Yeah...

229
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,580
And so...

230
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,180
And then I was just like...

231
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,700
Oh my gosh...

232
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,380
Wait...

233
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,380
This kind of...

234
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,600
Game is so fun...

235
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,920
And then by that point...

236
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,160
I was like...

237
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,960
Vampire...

238
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,260
The Vampire Survivors hype...

239
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,580
Had like...

240
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,320
Died down...

241
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
And I hadn't played it...

242
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,960
And then...

243
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,440
I was like...

244
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,240
Thinking the other day...

245
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,760
I was just like...

246
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,120
Oh man...

247
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,220
What can I have like...

248
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,300
On my schedule that...

249
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,220
Is...

250
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,080
Something that I can play...

251
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,260
Somewhat easily...

252
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,280
On my laptop...

253
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,560
Since I'm still in Japan...

254
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,280
And I was like...

255
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,660
Wait a second...

256
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,760
Um...

257
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,440
Holocure...

258
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,820
Is a thing...

259
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,320
And...

260
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,000
I've always...

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,020
I've been wanting to play it...

262
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,720
This whole time...

263
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,160
So...

264
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,340
Yeah...

265
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,620
We're here...

266
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,820
And I can play it...

267
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,700
And I can be like...

268
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,180
Hehe...

269
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
I know these people...

270
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,740
Hahaha...

271
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,480
Oh...

272
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,620
And of course...

273
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,180
My baby here...

274
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Kiwawa...

275
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,460
So...

276
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,000
Um...

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,340
I will...

278
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,740
Of course...

279
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,880
Play as Kiwawa...

280
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
I will try as many people as I can...

281
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,740
And see how...

282
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,160
Each one plays...

283
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,360
And...

284
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,660
Um...

285
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,420
Uh...

286
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:32,840
Which...

287
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,280
Kind of...

288
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
Suits my style...

289
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,140
My vibe...

290
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,380
Best...

291
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,480
And...

292
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,560
Uh...

293
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,140
But...

294
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,740
You know...

295
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,180
If I'm not a Kiwawa man...

296
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,160
Kiwawa...

297
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,540
Don't...

298
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,680
Don't hate me...

299
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:44,880
Okay?

300
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,420
Hehe...

301
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,940
If I'm not a Kiwawa man...

302
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,410
I will change my style...

303
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,900
My play style...

304
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,260
To become Kiwawa man...

305
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,180
Hahaha...

306
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,480
I've been seeing a lot of people saying theirs...

307
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,140
You know...

308
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,340
Someone earlier said Sui-chan...

309
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,860

The game?

336
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,000
Are the new girls in?

337
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,030
No...

338
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,450
Oh...

393
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,040

Mmm...

397
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,060
Hahaha...

398
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,560
Hahaha...

399
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,360
Hahaha...

400
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,480

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,080
It's like I'm your mom...

403
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,940
I'm calling you full name...

404
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,060
So that you...

405
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,960
Know you're in trouble...

406
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,260
K...

407
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:54,720

Hahaha...

411
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,860

412
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,440
Wow...

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,960
Thank you...

414
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,180
Hahaha...

415
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,400
Great to meet you...

416
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,020
At Otakutan...

417
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,900
At the beginning of the month...

418
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,540
Wow...

419
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,520
Thank you...

420
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,360
Hahaha...

421
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,400
Thank you...

422
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,720
Thank you...

423
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:10,800
Hahaha...

424
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,320
Mami Minto...

425
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,740
No...

426
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,840
Hahaha...

427
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,300

428
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,040
Hahaha...

429
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,520
Cool...

430
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,020
So...

431
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,920
We're gonna play...

432
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,320
Obviously we only have Mith here...

433
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,180
Let's see...

434
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,800

435
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,780
Shoots three projectiles forward...

436
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,480
Mid-range stab attack in front...

437
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,720
Tentacle...

438
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:34,960
Okay...

439
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,520
Let me explain also...

440
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,940
What kind of style I like...

441
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,780
Hiya Minto...

442
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,720
Guess who I main...

443
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,320
Okay...

444
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,520
You're Ame Oshii...

445
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
But...

446
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,160
I'm just gonna throw out...

447
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,640
Corona...

448
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:49,960
Hahaha...

449
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,500
Um...

450
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,380
So I kind of like...

451
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,580
Uh...

452
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,100
And if you watched my...

453
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,600
Um...

454
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,040
Maid of the Dead playthrough...

455
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,560
Maybe you...

456
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,920
Kind of see this...

457
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,700
When I...

458
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,040
Um...

459
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,000
Did that game...

460
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,900
Is like...

461
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,240
Uh...

462
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,460
Is like...

463
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,160
I like a...

464
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,680
I like having a barrier...

465
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,780
I like having a barrier...

466
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,760
That kind of melts people...

467
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,100
When they come in contact with me...

468
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,600
I like having...

469
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,620
Like something that spins around me...

470
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,160
So that when I walk...

471
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,700
It just kind of does the...

472
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,580
The work for me...

473
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:24,900
Hahaha...

474
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,200
So...

475
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,760
The BL book...

476
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,140
Okay...

477
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't know...

478
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,060
I don't know...

479
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,820
So Sana main...

480
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,100
Okay...

481
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,320
Okay...

482
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,100
Hahaha...

483
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,940
Okay...

484
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,140
Okay...

485
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,380
Okay...

486
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,100
Um...

487
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,720
Also...

488
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,580
I know some people will probably have...

489
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,740
Many opinions...

490
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,260
On...

491
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,970
Who I should play...

492
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Or what the meta is...

493
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,540
Or...

494
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,520
How to best enjoy the game...

495
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,280
In their opinion...

496
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,220
But...

497
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,740
Since this is my first time playing...

498
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,520
I'm just gonna take it easy...

499
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,660
I'm just gonna have a good time with it...

500
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,120
Let's just have a good time...

501
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,700
I don't mind backseating...

502
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,760
But try not to get too passionate about it...

503
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,020
Okay...

504
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,780
Hahaha...

505
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,800
So...

506
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,620
Yeah...

507
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,020
Just wanna throw that out there...

508
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,760
Keywawa!

509
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,580
Short range slash in front...

510
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,500
Okay...

511
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,860
Oh!

512
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,920
They also have different HP's and everything...

513
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,400
Swings and a half circle arc in the front!

514
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,580
Cali...

515
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,560
Awww...

516
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,740
Should I start with...

517
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,340
Keywawa sounds hard to start with though!

518
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,960
Short range slash in the front?

519
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:27,980
Heheh...

520
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,420
Sounds hard...

521
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,540
Kali's...

522
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:34,980
Feels...

523
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,920
I was gonna say Kali probably would be the quote-unquote easiest.

524
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,700
Also!

525
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,300
Oh!

526
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,340
I wanted to say!

527
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,340
The little sprite!

528
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,720
Kaitsu, thank you!

529
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,780
You guys see the sprite on my...

530
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
The one on my head is moving really fast.

531
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,580
And then the other one is kind of going slow.

532
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,180
So I just added both.

533
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,160
But look!

534
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,140
I'm basically like a little...

535
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,620
I'm in Holocure style!

536
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,880
So thank you!

537
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,540
Thank you Kaitsu for the...

538
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,680
You pumped this out so fast!

539
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,320
Thank you!

540
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,680
Thank you!

541
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,520
Trying to fall off my head?

542
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,280
She can try as she might but she's glued there.

543
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,420
You can't see because of my big head.

544
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,060
But Kali is like running so funny.

545
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,940
Okay!

546
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,200
Let's try Kali then.

547
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,820
Maybe?

548
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,540
No VTuber!

549
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,760
Why you no pick my mane?

550
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,600
Stage mode.

551
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,240
Endless mode.

552
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Let's do stage mode first.

553
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,200
Okay, I'm playing on keyboard.

554
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,380
Is it Wasta?

555
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,580
Or is it...

556
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,620
Is it Wasta?

557
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,740
Or is it...

558
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,880
It is Wasta?

559
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,480
Okay, okay.

560
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm guessing Wasta and then I control direction with my mouse.

561
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm guessing.

562
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,120
So...

563
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,900
Hollow Aqua.

564
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,660
Oh!

565
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,120
I want to play the Halloween castle!

566
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,620
Uh-uh.

567
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,200
Javits security contractor got seriously mad with people.

568
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,860
Oh well.

569
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,460
Yeah, I remember you saying that before.

570
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,460
But yeah, it was the last song.

571
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:11,960
So it's okay.

572
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,580
Okay.

573
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,840
Grassy plains it is.

574
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,980
Here I go.

575
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,260
Right click or left click to toggle.

576
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,920
Right stick to aim.

577
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,340
Wait.

578
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,260
Okay, okay.

579
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,780
So...

580
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,960
Okay, okay.

581
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,020
And then we collect these.

582
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,200
Oh my gosh.

583
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,920
Wait, wait, wait.

584
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,900
Yeah.

585
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah.

586
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,880
There we go.

587
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,860
Okay, okay.

588
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,420
Yeah.

589
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,880
Yeah.

590
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,060
Oh!

591
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,480
Okay.

592
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,140
Our first upgrade.

593
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,850
You should use controller.

594
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,470
Well, that's not possible because I am...

595
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,390
I am in Japan and I don't have a controller.

596
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,330
But thanks for your recommendation.

597
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,030
I think I...

598
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,150
I feel like I'm going to be saying that probably like 50 times this stream.

599
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:08,570
But...

600
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,530
You know.

601
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,130
Two.

602
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,910
Upgrade the scythe swing.

603
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,150
Increase damage.

604
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:15,950
Hold on.

605
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,950
Let me read everything first, you guys.

606
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,830
Stop it!

607
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,530
Let me read everything first!

608
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:30,230
Gain 1% crit buff every second up to 10% if taking damage by the target.

609
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,390
That's half the buff.

610
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,930
If eating food, plus 5% crit for 10 seconds.

611
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,130
Gain a shield that absorbs up to 15 damage.

612
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,410
Every 15 seconds, the shield refreshes.

613
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,470
Also reduces damage.

614
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,030
Oh, it's a body pillow, though.

615
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,210
Who needs to read?

616
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,050
Yeah.

617
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,290
No reading allowed, VTuber.

618
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,330
We're not reading.

619
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,290
You know what?

620
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,590
I'm going to play eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

621
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,370
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

622
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,870
Catch a tiger by his toe.

623
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,430
If he hollers, let him go.

624
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,170
My mom said to...

625
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,050
Pick the very best one.

626
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,130
And you are not it.

627
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,970
You guys got lucky.

628
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,290
What was it?

629
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,770
Oh, okay.

630
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,230
Wait, wait, wait.

631
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,010
So...

632
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,810
Hold on.

633
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,470
So it's...

634
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,170
Oh, okay.

635
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:24,930
I see how it is.

636
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,770
I see how it works.

637
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,210
Okay, okay.

638
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,690
I thought it was like click.

639
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,430
Oh, no!

640
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,810
The deadbeats!

641
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,830
I thought it was like click to...

642
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,230
Okay, I get it.

643
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:35,510
I get it.

644
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:35,730
I get it.

645
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:35,850
I get it.

646
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,870
Yeah, click and just leave it.

647
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,450
You auto attack.

648
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,190
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

649
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,730
Okay, got it.

650
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:39,930
Got it.

651
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,150
Got it.

652
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,330
I like to have the control.

653
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,570
Do you guys feel that way too?

654
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,950
Do you guys feel that way?

655
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,650
It's automatic attacking.

656
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,910
Yeah, I thought like if I left clicked, it would attack.

657
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,130
Do like an additional.

658
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,810
But that makes sense.

659
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,370
Mm-hmm.

660
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:53,950
Okay.

661
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:54,750
Death.

662
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,630
When defeating a target with Scythe Swing or Death, there's a 20% chance to create an explosion?

663
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,530
Ooh.

664
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,750
Picky, picky, picky mine.

665
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,310
Targets within 100 pixels take 10% extra damage.

666
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,930
How much is 100 pixels?

667
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,260
Picky, picky, picky mine.

668
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,640
100 pixels.

669
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,820
Oh, it'll show you a circle.

670
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,340
Okay.

671
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,000
It'll show you on screen.

672
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,340
Okay.

673
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,560
It was like people out here literally counting individual pixels.

674
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,920
Increase attack area by 15%.

675
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,180
Okay.

676
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,900
That's a lot.

677
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,160
Well, we already have this in our lineup.

678
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,580
Okay.

679
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,140
I see now.

680
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,280
We have one, two, three, four, five things.

681
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,060
Gain 15%.

682
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,520
Oh, sorry.

683
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,520
15 max HP for every six points of total max HP.

684
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,400
Increase damage.

685
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,780
So, people are saying that the P-Mine is good.

686
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,360
Picky, picky, picky mine.

687
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,820
Does the ghost sick?

688
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,800
Yeah, a little bit sick.

689
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,190
One or two.

690
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,810
I did say that I like to have like a little...

691
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,610
Well, it's 10% extra damage, but it's not like a barrier like I wanted.

692
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:21,890
What?

693
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,670
What do the stars and stuff mean?

694
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,090
These two have stars.

695
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,350
This one is obviously attack.

696
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,310
And then this one is a little t-shirt.

697
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,450
Just what kind of skill they are.

698
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,390
Stars are passive skills.

699
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,170
Okay.

700
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,890
Stars don't take up slots.

701
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,590
Oh, wait.

702
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:46,970
Actually?

703
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,770
Oh, I see it.

704
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:48,990
Okay.

705
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,470
Now I see it.

706
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:49,850
Oh, okay.

707
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,210
Item, weapon, skill, skill.

708
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,990
I see it.

709
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,290
I see it.

710
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:53,510
I see it.

711
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,630
I see it.

712
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,110
I can read.

713
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,730
Let's try death.

714
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,370
Oh, my gosh.

715
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,130
Scared me.

716
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,630
Oh, my gosh.

717
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,310
There's so many guys here.

718
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,090
Go away.

719
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,010
Go away.

720
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,170
I'm just trying to collect my stuff.

721
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,510
Why?

722
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,390
The deadbeats so powerful.

723
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,470
It takes so much.

724
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,850
They're beefy.

725
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:17,730
KFP.

726
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,110
I got a coin.

727
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,670
Nice.

728
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,150
Yeah.

729
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,590
Nice.

730
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,050
Nice.

731
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,970
You guys, I'm taking the BL.

732
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,070
Oh, wait.

733
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,190
I just saw that there's...

734
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:38,990
Okay.

735
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,350
Now...

736
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,530
Okay.

737
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:39,790
Sorry.

738
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,150
I'm...

739
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,650
I'm like observing even more.

740
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,270
Now there's...

741
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,050
I see the six slots for the items.

742
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,550
Yippee.

743
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,070
Yeah.

744
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,450
Oh, my gosh.

745
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,710
Come on.

746
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,910
Pass away.

747
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,210
Death.

748
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,910
Oh, I guess they're kind of already dead.

749
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,210
But...

750
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,370
Oh.

751
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,270
That was close.

752
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,330
Oh, my God.

753
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,370
Wait.

754
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:02,890
Wait.

755
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,190
Oh, no.

756
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,850
Oh.

757
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,650
Always love the surprise.

758
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,130
People are like...

759
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,130
That's what people have for the first KFP.

760
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,210
Face mask.

761
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,370
Multiply all damage dealt by 1.3 times and increase haste by 10%.

762
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,270
Take 30% more damage.

763
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,210
Oof.

764
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,310
Oof.

765
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,490
Do I want to add an extra book?

766
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,410
I think I shouldn't...

767
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:29,570
Oh.

768
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,390
This is attack area.

769
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:37,770
Yeah.

770
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:38,850
Deadbeats.

771
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,430
Oh.

772
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,390
Oh, my gosh.

773
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,190
Oh, my gosh.

774
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,690
Oh, my gosh.

775
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,590
Oh, my gosh.

776
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,870
They scared me.

777
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,290
Yeah.

778
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:46,830
Books.

779
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,450
Read.

780
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,830
Read.

781
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,070
Read.

782
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:48,970
Oh.

783
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,310
What's that?

784
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,070
What is...

785
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,230
Oh.

786
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,010
Hamburger.

787
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,910
I'll take that.

788
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:56,090
Oh.

789
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,550
That's health.

790
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,990
I'm guessing.

791
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,290
Oh, gosh.

792
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,930
We're getting a little...

793
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:01,770
Oh.

794
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,810
That was...

795
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,170
Yes.

796
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,330
Yes.

797
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,450
Yes.

798
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:03,670
Okay.

799
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,250
Mm.

800
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,550
Mm.

801
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:04,790
Mm.

802
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:04,970
Mm.

803
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,370
Burger.

804
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,450
Burger.

805
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:08,730
Burger.

806
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:08,790
Burger.

807
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,230
Burger.

808
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,210
We did get the explosion.

809
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,950
We did get the explosion, which is pretty good.

810
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,310
Oh.

811
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,250
I think, though I should increase my weapon damage.

812
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:19,850
Yes.

813
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,630
So let's do that.

814
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,610
Let's just kind of...

815
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,590
Because...

816
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:23,810
Yeah.

817
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,590
Being able to kill these guys, like, one...

818
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,890
Oh.

819
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,670
Oh, my gosh.

820
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,350
Being able to kill these guys in one shot would be really helpful.

821
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,870
Max weapon is always good.

822
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,410
I agree.

823
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,110
I agree.

824
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:38,490
I agree.

825
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,110
That's actually how I do try to play these kinds of games too.

826
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,330
So I like kind of focus on one thing.

827
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,090
We got two new things here.

828
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,750
Nurse's horn.

829
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,210
A certain sensei.

830
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,770
When defeating a target, their 30% chance to lifesteal.

831
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,070
Create an area of miasma.

832
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,530
Miasma is acting up.

833
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,410
Okay, actually wait.

834
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,530
This is kind of exactly...

835
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,710
Like I said, I like the books.

836
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,210
I like kind of the...

837
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,450
Oh, but this is nice though.

838
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,240
I have another question.

839
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,460
Are there drops?

840
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,600
Do they have...

841
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,860
Are some drops more common than other drops?

842
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,220
In terms of weapons or stuff like that?

843
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,000
Or is it pretty much all around equal?

844
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,440
So yes.

845
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,520
Kinda.

846
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,900
Yes and no.

847
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,200
Okay.

848
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,520
It's all equal.

849
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,240
Oh, it's random.

850
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,540
Okay.

851
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,360
That makes sense then.

852
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,220
Full random.

853
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:45,620
Okay.

854
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:45,860
Okay.

855
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,060
I don't know which one I want more!

856
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,640
The items you want never show up.

857
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,540
Isn't that just how life is?

858
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,140
Two is rarer?

859
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,500
Okay.

860
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,340
Let's go with two then.

861
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,960
Oh, hello.

862
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,580
My goodness.

863
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,340
Meow!

864
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,380
Meow!

865
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,020
Oya!

866
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,480
Oya!

867
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,160
Oya!

868
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:17,820
Oya!

869
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,320
Sorry, Yago.

870
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,180
Oh, sorry, Yago!

871
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,180
Oya!

872
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:22,700
Oya!

873
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,080
I'm trying to get this guy out of here.

874
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,100
Oya!

875
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,940
Oya!

876
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,140
Oh my gosh!

877
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm surrounded, you guys!

878
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,540
Oh, we got it!

879
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,340
Psycho axe.

880
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,530
Throw an axe that spirals outward from the player.

881
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,320
You'll like four?

882
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,620
Four is what you like?

883
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,060
It is?

884
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,040
Hi man, did you watch the Sonic 3 trailer?

885
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,520
You know what?

886
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,540
I actually haven't!

887
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,220
Oh my gosh.

888
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:03,940
And I have a friend.

889
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,780
She's going to kill me for not watching it yet.

890
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,340
But... I have not watched the new Sonic trailer yet.

891
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,480
But I've heard good things, I think.

892
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,420
Four and book farewell.

893
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,960
Okay.

894
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm trusting you guys.

895
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,780
I'm trusting you guys.

896
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,480
Even though I really want to actually take this one.

897
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,760
But I'm trusting.

898
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,640
I'm trusting.

899
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:21,880
Oh!

900
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,700
Delivery!

901
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,400
Milk!

902
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,130
Superman?

903
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,510
Oh wait, really?

904
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,710
Streamer lack?

905
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,470
Yippee!

906
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,430
I'll take it then.

907
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,470
Oh my gosh.

908
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,030
Oh my gosh.

909
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,050
Oh, I got a... I got a...

910
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,630
Open a super box.

911
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,310
I got an achievement even for it.

912
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,590
Oh yeah!

913
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,350
Oh yeah!

914
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,950
You guys were so right about the axe.

915
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:01,690
Oh my gosh.

916
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,030
Oh my gosh!

917
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,310
Workaholic.

918
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,930
That's very suiting for Calliope, isn't it?

919
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,150
Reach target defeated.

920
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,270
Increase attack by 2% for 2 seconds.

921
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,530
For 4 seconds up to 40%.

922
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,510
I didn't even read what the milk did.

923
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,530
I'll be honest.

924
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,370
I just grabbed it.

925
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,390
I think I'm going to go with the scythe though.

926
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,870
Having the time between attacks reduced is pretty good.

927
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,470
I think I'm going to...

928
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,350
It's a max level.

929
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,710
What's the max level actually?

930
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,010
What is the max level?

931
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,430
Seven.

932
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,190
Okay.

933
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:43,690
Thank you guys.

934
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,050
Glow stick!

935
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,150
Throw a glow stick to a nearby target and then spins...

936
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,530
So it's like a...

937
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,310
It's like a boomerang?

938
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,510
7 for weapons, 3 for items.

939
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,070
Gotcha.

940
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,090
Gotcha.

941
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,090
Gotcha.

942
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:58,430
Gotcha.

943
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,970
I'm going to go then with the axe.

944
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,070
Yeah!

945
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:07,250
Also, do the boxes just have health in them?

946
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,490
Or... usually?

947
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,830
Or is that like... kind of the general idea?

948
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:12,810
Oh!

949
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,030
The Togodachi!

950
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,230
Oh my gosh.

951
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:15,950
Wait, wait, wait!

952
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,430
Oh my gosh.

953
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,090
No, no, no, no!

954
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,150
Ouch!

955
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,250
Ah!

956
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,740
Health or XP.

957
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,340
Gotcha.

958
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,270
Milk, increase attack range.

959
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:32,490
Oh!

960
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,170
Nice.

961
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,250
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

962
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:38,690
Eeeek!

963
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,350
I'm just collecting my...

964
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,310
What I've dropped earlier.

965
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,810
These games are always so addicting.

966
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,030
You just can...

967
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,970
It's very easy to just kind of pick them up, you know?

968
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,770
When you're like...

969
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,930
When you're just hanging around.

970
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,350
And just... you can like play a game for like...

971
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,210
You can play a game for like a half hour or like three hours, you know?

972
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,070
Let's go for the scythe.

973
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,230
We're almost close to maxing it.

974
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:11,770
So...

975
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,510
Look at that guy!

976
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,570
So cute!

977
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,090
Oh!

978
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,070
Giant Togodachi!

979
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,730
Oh!

980
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,470
I just realized...

981
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,790
Are the...

982
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,750
Are the...

983
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,710
The wormy looking guys...

984
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,370
Are those chum buds?

985
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,950
I feel bad for not noticing soon.

986
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,710
I thought it was like...

987
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,230
Oh my gosh!

988
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:31,950
Yeah!

989
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,910
Yeah!

990
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,190
Oh god!

991
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:35,770
Oh god!

992
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,450
I really kind of...

993
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,710
Hurt myself there.

994
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,570
They're the shrimps?

995
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:43,930
Oh, okay.

996
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,940
I need health!

997
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,440
Yeah!

998
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,900
Gosh!

999
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,980
There's so many guys!

1000
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,820
Come from all sides!

1001
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,660
Yeah!

1002
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,500
Oh my gosh.

1003
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,680
Okay.

1004
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,440
We're gaining health though.

1005
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,560
We're doing alright.

1006
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,360
We're doing alright.

1007
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,180
Oh, here we go.

1008
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,660
There we go.

1009
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:09,980
Oh!

1010
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,520
Nice.

1011
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,380
You can see items and skill descriptions at the menu anytime.

1012
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:15,820
Oh!

1013
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,360
Awesome!

1014
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,860
Thank you!

1015
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,880
Um...

1016
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,320
I'm gonna go with this one because...

1017
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,700
Hmm...

1018
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,020
Wait.

1019
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,560
Two?

1020
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,760
What's two?

1021
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,460
Targets with...

1022
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:36,600
Oh!

1023
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,020
This one!

1024
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,940
Oh!

1025
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
It's just like a skill.

1026
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,340
You guys said that this one doesn't take up any slots, so...

1027
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,300
Let's go for it!

1028
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,240
Oh!

1029
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,840
I see it!

1030
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,520
I see it!

1031
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,780
Oh!

1032
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,480
Oh!

1033
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:49,920
Oh!

1034
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,180
Oh!

1035
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,500
Oh!

1036
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:50,720
Oh!

1037
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,320
I'm going in!

1038
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm being greedy!

1039
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,460
Oh!

1040
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,120
The scythe!

1041
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,780
Is this...

1042
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,440
Wait.

1043
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,120
What is this?

1044
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,160
This isn't the max level, is it?

1045
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
Scythe swing awaken?

1046
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,300
Is this the max level?

1047
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,260
Yeah!

1048
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:05,660
Oh!

1049
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,140
Yippee!

1050
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,380
Super body pillow!

1051
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,760
How

1052
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,140
do you guys know if it's like a...

1053
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,660
If it's like a really good pull or not?

1054
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,570
Wandering taco!

1055
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,150
Thanks for the...

1056
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,380
It's the lights?

1057
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:37,680
Oh!

1058
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,100
I see.

1059
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,300
I see.

1060
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,500
I see.

1061
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,580
Um...

1062
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,760
Gain a shield that absorbs...

1063
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:40,860
Oh!

1064
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,160
I guess I'll take it.

1065
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,480
Why not?

1066
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:42,960
You know?

1067
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,280
Oh!

1068
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,580
Oh!

1069
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:43,820
Oh!

1070
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,560
Oh my gosh!

1071
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,760
Eww!

1072
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,440
Oh!

1073
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,880
They look so... creepy crawly.

1074
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,480
With the little shrimps.

1075
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
They look so creepy crawly.

1076
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,260
You're a zoo!

1077
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,960
I'm not casually using a baller luck for the gear, but...

1078
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,620
I'm not even like noticing...

1079
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:19,960
I'm not...

1080
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm just here!

1081
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,300
Okay?

1082
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,440
Okay?

1083
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,860
Okay, out here rigging... Go with one.

1084
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,120
Reach target defeated and increase attack by 2% for 4 seconds, up to 40%.

1085
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,230
What's headphones?

1086
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,790
15% chance to negate one hit.

1087
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,310
Create a shockwave that knocks back all targets.

1088
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,720
I kind of want to level up my healing, but so far we're doing all right.

1089
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,520
So I'll try one.

1090
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,080
I'll listen to you guys for now.

1091
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,900
I know nothing, so... I'll follow your advice.

1092
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,540
I'll follow your advice a little bit.

1093
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,020
You know, whatever.

1094
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,460
Oh, the Maiaizama!

1095
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,660
Okay, I kind of want to take this one.

1096
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,220
Okay.

1097
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,020
Yes!

1098
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,200
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1099
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,280
The super items only have a 5% drop rate.

1100
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,900
Wait, really?

1101
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,280
Maiaizama.

1102
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:21,880
Oh my gosh.

1103
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,600
Oh my gosh.

1104
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,040
Oh my gosh.

1105
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,800
Touhou Dodge.

1106
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,640
Oh, there's so many things circling me.

1107
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,020
This is what always gets me about these games too, though.

1108
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,000
There's so many things that end up circling that it's hard to...

1109
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,500
view what is going on the screen.

1110
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,520
You know what I mean?

1111
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,420
How much luck did you get from your hololoshes?

1112
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,540
I can't help it.

1113
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,460
I'm just a simp, you know?

1114
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,800
We're still okay on health, so let's...

1115
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,460
do that.

1116
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,700
Well, increase...

1117
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,100
Increase attack in all fields.

1118
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,060
Increase attack...

1119
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,120
Attack, attack, attack.

1120
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,300
Oh no, no, no!

1121
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,640
Giant!

1122
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,120
Giant shrimp.

1123
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,420
Giant shrimp, giant shrimp, giant shrimp!

1124
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,440
Thank you!

1125
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,640
Yeah, I'm a simp.

1126
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,280
You know, when I first created that...

1127
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,580
That voice line...

1128
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,140
It's supposed to be for everybody else, you know?

1129
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,040
For you guys, but in the end...

1130
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,520
You're a simp.

1131
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,120
You're a soup.

1132
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,980
It only just ended up describing myself.

1133
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,340
It's like me calling myself a simp.

1134
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,100
Basically.

1135
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,000
This guy is relentless.

1136
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,220
Oh, dippy!

1137
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,300
Chat reflects the streamer.

1138
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,380
What's this?

1139
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,460
Oh, the pickup range!

1140
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,640
Hollow bomb.

1141
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,660
A bomb that explodes, dealing damage to all nearby targets.

1142
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,660
Remove hit limit.

1143
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,960
There's a hit limit on it?

1144
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,480
Is the bomb not that good?

1145
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,820
Is the bomb not that good?

1146
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,860
I like the pickup range.

1147
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,480
I like the pickup range.

1148
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,020
Go for skills.

1149
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,440
Bomb's okay.

1150
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,560
Okay, okay, okay.

1151
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,140
Two is a trap.

1152
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,880
Two is a trap.

1153
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,820
Anything but two!

1154
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,420
Okay.

1155
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,240
We'll go for five.

1156
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:39,480
Oh!

1157
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,200
Yippee!

1158
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,700
Super headphones!

1159
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,940
You guys, I think it's...

1160
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,560
Is the game broken?

1161
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,880
How did I get three in a row?

1162
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,770
Are you playing an old version?

1163
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,110
No!

1164
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,970
I just... I just got this yesterday.

1165
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,690
I'm worried for your safety.

1166
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,730
Should I just take it then?

1167
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,510
I guess I should take all the super stuff, shouldn't I?

1168
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,170
Rigged!

1169
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,790
What are you talking about?

1170
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,050
Who's rigging this?

1171
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:32,830
No!

1172
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,150
If I dropped it, it would make you guys feel better?

1173
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,210
Make you guys feel better?

1174
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,110
Since I'm like...

1175
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,650
You guys are like, she's cheating!

1176
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:40,750
No!

1177
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:40,830
It's hurting!

1178
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,190
All healing is doubled!

1179
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,230
It's an eye...

1180
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,010
No?

1181
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:54,750
Let's...

1182
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,770
Let's go for workaholic.

1183
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,530
We'll up...

1184
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,050
We'll up that skill.

1185
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,100
I'm taking my money.

1186
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm taking all your money.

1187
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm taking the money.

1188
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,060
Okay.

1189
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,320
Oh, this is all new stuff.

1190
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,160
Okay, interesting.

1191
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,680
Drop lava on the ground.

1192
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,720
Oh, I like ones like that too!

1193
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,400
Three?

1194
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,520
Okay, I'm glad we're all in agreement then.

1195
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,240
Wow!

1196
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,640
Oh!

1197
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,100
The extra strong chumboids.

1198
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,100
Why are they closing in so slow?

1199
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,480
They're closing in so slow.

1200
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,820
Oh, wait.

1201
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,780
They're not even closing in.

1202
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,180
Never mind.

1203
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,440
Donating a little luck so nothing bad happens.

1204
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,220
I seriously don't know, you guys.

1205
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:04,940
I don't know.

1206
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,740
Maybe my game is borked.

1207
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,360
I have no idea.

1208
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,520
Three?

1209
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,440
Yeah, you know what?

1210
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,260
It's time that we level up our BL book.

1211
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,080
We can get some additional in here.

1212
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,680
Give us a little bit of a boost, you know?

1213
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,280
Give me...

1214
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,860
your money.

1215
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,840
Bye!

1216
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,080
Okay, there we go.

1217
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,520
Gosh!

1218
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,700
Oh gosh, they're so fast.

1219
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,380
Coin!

1220
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,500
Does the...

1221
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,820
I'm guessing the coins unlock new people.

1222
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,180
I was gonna say characters, but like...

1223
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,920
It's kinda weird to call them characters, right?

1224
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,660
Gosh!

1225
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,300
Oh, it's gotcha!

1226
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,320
Uh-oh.

1227
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,560
Oh, boar sheep!

1228
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,020
Every 10 seconds, food will drop close by.

1229
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,470
We also still have one weapon slot left.

1230
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,590
Let's go with the...

1231
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,270
Let's go with upgrading this, cuz...

1232
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,470
Oh my gosh.

1233
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,110
Oh my gosh.

1234
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,630
Oh my gosh.

1235
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:23,990
Oh my gosh.

1236
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,270
Oh my gosh.

1237
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,810
She's huge!

1238
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,530
She's huge!

1239
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,980
The bat is so menacing.

1240
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,280
Oh my gosh.

1241
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,960
Oh my gosh.

1242
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,100
Sorry, I'll go.

1243
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,140
Oh, I destroyed the Yaogo statue.

1244
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,780
Oh, gosh, they're mad at me.

1245
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,280
Wait.

1246
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,060
I see an angry taco.

1247
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,100
Oh, gosh.

1248
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,340
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I'm trying to juke through these guys.

1249
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,300
Holy cow!

1250
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,460
I'm trying to juke through them!

1251
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,540
Oh my gosh.

1252
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,280
It's okay, health is still fine.

1253
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,600
Health is decent.

1254
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,980
Why are the tacos so angry at me?

1255
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,960
We're still okay, we're still okay.

1256
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,780
Give me more coins!

1257
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,100
Coins!

1258
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,520
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1259
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,160
I'd like to know who is responsible for the spider cooking.

1260
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,520
And who is carrying the bucket of lava.

1261
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,700
Follow the arrow?

1262
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,540
Oh, okay, so we...

1263
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,120
Okay, I was gonna say, I don't see him anymore.

1264
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,160
So I must have killed him.

1265
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,880
I didn't see the arrow.

1266
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,100
I see it now though, thank you guys.

1267
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,480
Oh, my nose is so clogged up.

1268
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
Hold on, let me take a sippy.

1269
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,540
Let's go for it.

1270
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,960
Oh, I thought you meant like, who is...

1271
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,260
Who is carrying these like, in-game.

1272
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,680
Yeah, no, the spider cooking is hachama.

1273
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,900
What's the bucket of lava though?

1274
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,780
Oh, lava is miko.

1275
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,520
I see, I see.

1276
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,840
I see, I see.

1277
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,640
I see, I see.

1278
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:12,660
I see, I see.

1279
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,480
I see, I see.

1280
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,860
Okay, surely...

1281
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,360
Surely, my luck cannot be like, so crazy, you know?

1282
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,360
Open!

1283
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,200
Okay, you guys see?

1284
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,740
I'm not hacking!

1285
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,680
I'm not hacking!

1286
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,400
See?

1287
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,320
Nothing of the sort.

1288
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,200
Okay, they found out.

1289
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,740
Shut it down, shut it down.

1290
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,240
Shut it down, shut it down.

1291
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,020
They found out.

1292
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,880
We got too greedy.

1293
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,680
Turn it off.

1294
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,220
Turn it off.

1295
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,940
She toggled it.

1296
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,820
Let's go with the bucket.

1297
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:21,820
Lava.

1298
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,980
Oh, I got an achievement.

1299
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,180
Don't take any damage for five minutes.

1300
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:26,500
Wow!

1301
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,560
Oh, no, not the plug.

1302
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,020
Fire a fast piercing tail targeted at a random target.

1303
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,630
I think I'll still go with this one.

1304
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,570
We'll go with death again.

1305
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,390
Oh, my gosh.

1306
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,050
Oh, my gosh.

1307
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,530
Oh, my gosh.

1308
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:54,890
Oh, my gosh.

1309
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:55,250
Oh, my gosh.

1310
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,670
Oh, go with nurse's horde.

1311
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:57,890
Oh, my gosh.

1312
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:58,170
Yeah!

1313
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,530
Okay, boss battle time.

1314
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,230
I think.

1315
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:01,510
Maybe.

1316
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,070
Probably.

1317
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,430
Is this boss battle?

1318
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:03,710
I guess.

1319
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:06,410
Fubuzilla.

1320
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:08,930
Oh.

1321
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,550
Yeah!

1322
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,500
Toho.

1323
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,420
I see it.

1324
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,100
Rainbow.

1325
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,700
Yeah.

1326
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:21,920
Yeah.

1327
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:22,200
Yeah.

1328
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,540
Yeah.

1329
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:22,820
Yeah.

1330
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,020
Yeah.

1331
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:23,560
Yeah.

1332
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,060
Yeah.

1333
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:25,860
Yeah.

1334
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,500
See, this is kind of like why I like to have kind of a barrier around me.

1335
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:38,120
Because with things like this, I can use my big attacks to focus on the main enemy.

1336
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,580
And then we get it done, baby.

1337
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,600
We get it done, baby.

1338
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,380
Let's...

1339
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,420
Increase damage by 30%.

1340
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,900
Oh, it went up a little bit.

1341
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,260
You know what?

1342
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,780
We'll do that one.

1343
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,460
Delivery.

1344
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,400
Oh, three of them.

1345
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,860
Yippee.

1346
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,160
Dun, dun, dun.

1347
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,600
One more book.

1348
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,420
Okay.

1349
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,620
Oh, yeah.

1350
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,560
Yeah.

1351
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,740
Oh, okay.

1352
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,320
I couldn't see my cursor for a second.

1353
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,200
What are you talking about?

1354
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,880
It wasn't even a special one, you guys.

1355
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,500
Head.

1356
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:25,800
Head.

1357
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,320
Oh, wait.

1358
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,700
I was going to do this one, but...

1359
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,540
Throw two lava.

1360
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,720
No, I think I'll go with the BL book.

1361
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,140
We'll focus on getting the BL book as much as we can.

1362
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,420
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

1363
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,540
Minto, stop hacking.

1364
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,820
If only my gacha luck was as good as this for Blue Archive.

1365
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,380
I want good gacha luck, you guys.

1366
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,920
Wait, what are these things?

1367
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,460
It's kind of hard.

1368
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,220
Oh, oh, just kidding.

1369
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:54,660
They're...

1370
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:54,960
I see.

1371
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,240
They're...

1372
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,800
They're...

1373
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,240
They're the little rats.

1374
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,860
Little bay rats.

1375
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,360
Yeah, yeah.

1376
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,000
Oh, gosh.

1377
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,760
I couldn't see my...

1378
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,720
I couldn't see my cursor for a second.

1379
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:03,720
Oh, gosh.

1380
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:03,940
Oh, gosh.

1381
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,060
Um...

1382
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:06,820
Oh!

1383
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:07,860
Attack up.

1384
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,120
The brats.

1385
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:14,840
Hmm.

1386
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,420
Okay, so we're either going to have to take a new item...

1387
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,100
Oh, I have two slots for items.

1388
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:21,380
Okay.

1389
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,320
It's only one slot for...

1390
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,560
Okay.

1391
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,440
Let's see.

1392
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,340
Um...

1393
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,780
Gain 1% gold.

1394
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,540
I'm going to crit buff every 10 seconds, up to 10.

1395
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,140
If we get a stat up, though...

1396
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,940
That doesn't take any extra...

1397
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,360
I guess...

1398
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,420
I mean...

1399
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,360
I'm just...

1400
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,220
You guys, I'm like so picky about...

1401
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,720
This is how I am in these types of games.

1402
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,240
I'm like, oh, but like, I have to save these slots for like...

1403
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,480
What if something I really, really want, you know?

1404
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,480
Healing is doubled.

1405
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,860
One is okay.

1406
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,000
If eating food, 5% crit for 10 seconds.

1407
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,880
Uber sheep every 10 seconds.

1408
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,080
Oh, the food drop.

1409
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:12,550
You know what?

1410
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:16,230
Let's go with Uber sheep, because these are both healing.

1411
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:19,890
You heal enough.

1412
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,190
I know.

1413
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,570
I'm not really taking any damage.

1414
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,270
So maybe, actually, this one would be better.

1415
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,200
Maybe the sake would be better.

1416
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, I don't really need healing, huh?

1417
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,140
Well, what if I do...

1418
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,580
I don't know.

1419
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,360
I can't get cocky, you guys.

1420
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
That's when it gets bad.

1421
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,440
Oh, what's this?

1422
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,480
Upgrade!

1423
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,990
The BL book.

1424
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,230
But what if I use it on...

1425
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,130
You guys, I can still buy, or, you know, I can...

1426
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,890
The BL book still has upgrades.

1427
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,270
But this one, I can get an extra thing for my scythe.

1428
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:06,910
The scythe can't be...

1429
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,870
I can't upgrade it anymore unless it's with this, I'm guessing, right?

1430
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,590
Book is still priority?

1431
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,060
BL is zero cost.

1432
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,340
Does this cost something?

1433
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,950
Scythe uses gacha money.

1434
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:28,150
Oh!

1435
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,110
Okay.

1436
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,650
Wait, hold on.

1437
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,130
Let me see.

1438
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,750
It won't let me undo.

1439
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:36,650
Oh, okay.

1440
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:36,890
There we go.

1441
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,890
Okay, okay.

1442
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,810
Oh, use an anvil!

1443
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:41,790
Yippee!

1444
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,190
Goodbye, little rat.

1445
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:51,830
Oh my gosh.

1446
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,430
This is when the game starts getting really satisfying, you know?

1447
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,790
When you're just like, plowing through everything.

1448
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,010
And it's just like, so satisfying to watch everything go down.

1449
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,890
They're just slicing and dicing.

1450
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,930
And it feels so...

1451
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:13,530
So good.

1452
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,350
How long are these levels?

1453
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,430
I thought that it was...

1454
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,770
I thought it would have been done by Iago.

1455
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:23,630
I thought it would have been done after Fubuzilla.

1456
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:25,750
Hi, Minto.

1457
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,630
Sorry I couldn't read the rest of your super chat, but thank you!

1458
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,830
Hello!

1459
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,870
20 minutes?

1460
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:31,410
Oh, okay.

1461
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:31,810
That's not bad.

1462
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,630
We're almost there.

1463
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,490
Oh!

1464
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,550
Spider cooking!

1465
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,610
Fubuzilla was the mini-boss!

1466
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:50,530
Okay.

1467
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,370
I see.

1468
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,540
Minto.

1469
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,520
That's me.

1470
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,900
I'm Minto.

1471
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,300
Oh my gosh.

1472
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,480
The books are so awesome.

1473
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,420
Oh my gosh.

1474
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,400
Crony's clocks are just...

1475
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:25,940
Oh!

1476
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,600
Big clock.

1477
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,800
I saw him spawn.

1478
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,240
Okay, here we go.

1479
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,300
Yeah!

1480
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,940
Take him out!

1481
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,360
Take him out!

1482
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,980
Take him out!

1483
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,860
Take him out!

1484
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,260
Take him out!

1485
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,220
Lead him to the lava!

1486
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:36,920
Lead him to the lava!

1487
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,600
Oh, just kidding.

1488
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,940
Lead him to the lava!

1489
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,560
Oh, leave it...

1490
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,040
Lava, lava, lava, lava, lava, lava.

1491
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,620
Oh, just kidding.

1492
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,860
Come on.

1493
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,120
Back in the lava!

1494
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,180
Oh, yippee!

1495
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,720
King Rolex.

1496
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,360
Oh, there's an arrow.

1497
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:56,880
Thank you.

1498
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,460
I'm gonna still go with the spider cooking.

1499
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,120
I see the arrow down there.

1500
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:06,900
Oh, it's an anvil.

1501
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,720
Nice!

1502
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Small knockback.

1503
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,000
Let's see.

1504
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,120
BL book?

1505
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,780
Gold anvil?

1506
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,700
It doesn't look gold to me.

1507
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,220
The pink anvil?

1508
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,540
Pink arrow?

1509
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,560
Did I miss?

1510
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,300
The lava.

1511
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:31,620
Oh, wait.

1512
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,340
How do I...

1513
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:32,700
Oh, there we go.

1514
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:34,980
Plus 50!

1515
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,880
Oh, just kidding.

1516
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,720
This one.

1517
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,140
There we go.

1518
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,260
I see.

1519
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,260
It costs 50.

1520
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,600
It's a little pricey.

1521
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,280
Where's the pink?

1522
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,460
Where's the pink?

1523
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,040
Oh, I see it!

1524
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,260
I see it!

1525
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:47,460
I see it!

1526
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:47,620
Okay.

1527
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,600
Up here!

1528
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,020
Up here!

1529
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:49,440
Up here!

1530
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:49,860
Up here!

1531
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:50,320
Wow!

1532
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,540
What is...

1533
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:52,620
Oh!

1534
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,960
These two collab?

1535
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,670
Can you collab anything or does it have to be certain things?

1536
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,620
Certain things.

1537
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,080
Got it.

1538
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,560
BL fujoshi!

1539
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,340
Endless BL!

1540
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,480
How shameless!

1541
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,260
Wow!

1542
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:27,990
Oh!

1543
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:28,770
Oh!

1544
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:29,530
Oh!

1545
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:30,270
Oh!

1546
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:33,870
I feel invincible right now, you guys.

1547
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,410
How shameless.

1548
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,470
Just all this BL on my stream.

1549
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:43,870
Okay.

1550
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:44,750
That's where my cursor is.

1551
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:45,690
I couldn't find it for a second.

1552
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,270
Oh.

1553
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,670
Everybody's all strong now though.

1554
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:54,470
Lava!

1555
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,280
Q time?

1556
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:03,880
What's that mean?

1557
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,720
Q?

1558
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:05,800
Q?

1559
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:06,580
Q?

1560
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,520
Q?

1561
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,480
Time for Q?

1562
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,640
What do you mean?

1563
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,200
What's that mean?

1564
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,060
What's going on?

1565
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,820
Oh my gosh!

1566
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,520
Oh my gosh!

1567
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,220
Oh my gosh!

1568
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:23,460
Hahaha...

1569
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,340
Yippee!

1570
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,400
Oh!

1571
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,080
Yes!

1572
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:31,580
The saw!

1573
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:31,920
Okay.

1574
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,600
I thought you were...

1575
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,040
I thought you guys meant like...

1576
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,960
You can press Q on your keyboard.

1577
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,460
Which one do I want to do?

1578
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,940
Let's get the wrapper up.

1579
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,510
Eat all that.

1580
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,000
Let's go for the bucket of lava.

1581
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,260
I do want to get that one.

1582
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,120
As max as possible.

1583
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:10,920
The bucket.

1584
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,780
The bucket.

1585
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,340
Giant Debut.

1586
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,060
I just noticed him.

1587
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,040
There's two of them!

1588
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,720
Get him in the lava.

1589
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,400
Get him in the lava.

1590
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,060
Get him in the lava.

1591
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:28,580
Nice.

1592
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,500
Level 6.

1593
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,820
Here we go.

1594
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,740
Oh my gosh.

1595
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,160
Ouchie.

1596
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,700
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1597
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,600
Oh my gosh.

1598
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,780
I didn't realize the chum bud was still alive.

1599
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,440
Okay.

1600
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,000
Okay.

1601
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,360
Okay.

1602
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:41,520
Okay.

1603
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,660
Okay.

1604
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,760
Bucket max, baby.

1605
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:46,780
Yippee!

1606
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,330
Some people are just kidding.

1607
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,630
I don't think I should take it.

1608
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:03,310
Should I take it?

1609
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,990
I don't know if I should take it.

1610
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,890
What if I get something else that I want?

1611
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,490
Makes a good collab.

1612
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,850
Okay.

1613
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:17,610
You know what?

1614
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,750
I should probably just try out everything that I can, you know?

1615
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,470
And we have this one as well.

1616
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,760
Take it.

1617
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,700
Might as well.

1618
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,570
Defeated Golden Yago.

1619
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,380
Which I don't even know what just happened.

1620
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,340
Everything happened so fast.

1621
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,400
Everything happened so quickly.

1622
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,260
I can combine these.

1623
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,060
Is this worth it?

1624
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,100
Yeah.

1625
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,340
What is this?

1626
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,600
May have severe unknown side effects if consumed.

1627
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,640
I don't even know what it created.

1628
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:22,140
Oh.

1629
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:22,660
Oh.

1630
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,360
Oh, it's like...

1631
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,620
Oh my gosh.

1632
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:25,960
What are these?

1633
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,060
Oh my gosh.

1634
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,860
Oh god.

1635
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,600
Elite cooking.

1636
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,540
They have their little shield.

1637
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,260
It's so cute.

1638
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,220
How am I not taking damage?

1639
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,180
Is my question.

1640
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,200
Sometimes.

1641
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,340
Sometimes I take damage, obviously.

1642
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:51,340
But like sometimes I'm just walking right on top of these guys and I'm not taking any damage.

1643
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,520
There we go.

1644
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,000
Get me out of this.

1645
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,020
Get me out of here.

1646
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,070
The body pillow.

1647
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,270
That's right.

1648
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:06,850
It does absorb.

1649
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,870
That's right.

1650
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:08,490
That's right.

1651
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,870
I forgot about that.

1652
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:16,850
Let's see.

1653
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,610
We're plugging it up, baby.

1654
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,710
I'm such an offense over defense believer.

1655
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,710
Like I'm such a like a...

1656
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:33,290
I will fire everything and have nothing to defend me.

1657
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:37,930
Valid.

1658
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:40,910
Ubersheet, please.

1659
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:41,250
Okay.

1660
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,210
Dang it.

1661
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,830
Next one, I'll do the Ubersheet.

1662
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:45,730
Oh, I'm stuck on a tree.

1663
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,140
Let's see.

1664
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,740
It's hard to tell.

1665
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,500
In the grassy areas, if there's stuff that I've missed, you know.

1666
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,180
Oh.

1667
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,420
Oh my gosh.

1668
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,140
Oh my gosh.

1669
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,600
We're aiming.

1670
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,200
We're aiming.

1671
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:27,840
We're aiming.

1672
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,400
We're aiming.

1673
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:30,740
Yeah.

1674
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:30,960
Yeah.

1675
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:31,080
Yeah.

1676
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:42,570
Ubersheet.

1677
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:44,170
Boop.

1678
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,730
You guys, I wasted up all my gotcha look.

1679
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,190
There's a slider for attack opacity.

1680
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,770
Oh, really?

1681
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:55,150
That would be great.

1682
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:55,870
Is it...

1683
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:59,210
I know that this is a problem with these kinds of games.

1684
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:04,930
But is it making the bit rate like all funky on your guys' end?

1685
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,430
Why are the...

1686
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,250
Sana lights so huge?

1687
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,510
Why are the Sana lights so huge?

1688
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:28,250
You know one song that I still listen to like probably near daily is Astro Girl.

1689
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,490
I love that song so much.

1690
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,630
It's so cute.

1691
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:36,770
It's like a...

1692
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:37,530
Because Sana is big.

1693
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:38,790
You're so right.

1694
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:40,570
My mistake.

1695
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:48,770
Anvil?

1696
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:49,470
Oh I see.

1697
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,550
I see the arrow.

1698
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:50,950
Thank you.

1699
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:51,790
Yeah.

1700
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,410
Don't be afraid to call things out like that.

1701
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,370
Oh my gosh.

1702
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:56,130
Oh my gosh.

1703
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:57,530
Uh.

1704
01:00:59,110 --> 01:00:59,510
Sucky.

1705
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:03,330
Um.

1706
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,450
Guess it would be the best to...

1707
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:10,990
A sheep?

1708
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:12,870
Really?

1709
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:13,470
Keep doing sheep?

1710
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,590
Okay, I'll keep doing sheep.

1711
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,010
I'm listening to you guys since it's my first time playing.

1712
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,290
Literally first...oh gosh!

1713
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,090
I'm trying to get...there was a bunch of stuff out there!

1714
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,710
Why is everybody so big?!

1715
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,670
Okay, wait a second.

1716
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,450
Or am I shrinking?

1717
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,610
You guys, either I'm shrinking...

1718
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,490
or...this world...

1719
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,950
is growing.

1720
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,080
Now we only have 30 seconds left.

1721
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,900
I believe we can make it.

1722
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,420
Right!

1723
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,020
Right guys!

1724
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,540
Oh my gosh, look at all of them.

1725
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,100
It's insanity in there.

1726
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,300
It's insanity in there!

1727
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,020
Oh gosh.

1728
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,280
Usha.

1729
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:23,820
Oh god!

1730
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,300
Oh my gosh.

1731
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,120
Oh my gosh!

1732
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,740
Ame!

1733
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,680
Where she comes?

1734
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:43,620
Yeah!

1735
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,720
Where's my mouse?

1736
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,040
There it is.

1737
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:47,280
Okay.

1738
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,620
Eat over 50 hamburgers!

1739
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,580
Hamburger country, yeah!

1740
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,680
What are you trying to say?

1741
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,620
Game?

1742
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,760
Don't shame me for eating over 50 hamburgers.

1743
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,320
I'm just saying.

1744
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,520
Oh my gosh.

1745
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,360
Back at my maid cafe, there's like a hamburger place I go to.

1746
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,540
Not like...so often.

1747
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,940
But you know...

1748
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,000
I like to have their hamburgers.

1749
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:25,580
And...

1750
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,640
And I miss it so much.

1751
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,440
She do be jumpin' though.

1752
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,980
She do be hoppin' and sittin' and ground-pounding.

1753
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,180
Oh!

1754
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:49,920
Yippee!

1755
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,720
Here, Minty.

1756
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,460
You can have a cheeseburger.

1757
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,020
Thanks.

1758
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,950
Best first run ever.

1759
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,170
Murphy!

1760
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:13,930
What the heck did you...

1761
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:14,530
Oh my gosh.

1762
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:14,730
Oh my gosh.

1763
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,650
You changed your profile picture.

1764
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,810
Thanks for the painting of the wood!

1765
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,470
Okay, so I probably have to go to what character select?

1766
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:23,550
New unlocks.

1767
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,270
Energy drink.

1768
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,670
Increase haste by 10%.

1769
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,170
Speed by 40%.

1770
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,950
Reduce max HP.

1771
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,610
Research is called game.

1772
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:33,410
1% XP.

1773
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:35,790
You're up soon.

1774
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,190
Minto gaming real.

1775
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:43,070
I guess it helps that I've like played this kind of game before, you know?

1776
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,470
Sorry.

1777
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:44,950
Oh gosh.

1778
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:45,970
Hold on, let me blow my nose.

1779
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,130
Don't mute.

1780
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:02,570
Sorry.

1781
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,310
Okay, hold on.

1782
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:03,950
Let me do it again.

1783
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,070
Allergies.

1784
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,650
No, I just have a bit of a cold.

1785
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:14,510
Is all.

1786
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,550
I just have a bit of a cold.

1787
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:22,290
Is all!

1788
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,830
The transparency of the weapons.

1789
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:28,130
Yeah.

1790
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:29,350
It's hard.

1791
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,690
Sometimes I'm like, where's my mouse?

1792
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:31,430
Because I can't find it.

1793
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:31,870
Wow!

1794
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,150
Thank you for the echo!

1795
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,990
Why does it seem to be super chat time game?

1796
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:40,790
What are you talking about?

1797
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,050
Oh.

1798
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:42,970
Okay.

1799
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:43,710
1% XP.

1800
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:44,490
Okay.

1801
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,290
I'll read it later.

1802
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:46,950
Fan beam.

1803
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:53,570
Shoot a powerful laser beam from the microphone.

1804
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:54,870
Horizontal only.

1805
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:55,410
Okay.

1806
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:59,210
Credit card.

1807
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,870
Cost of enhancing.

1808
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:03,550
It's reduced.

1809
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,690
It reminds me of when you get Sensei's credit card in Blue Archive.

1810
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:09,970
Stolen piggy bank.

1811
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:11,090
Game 1 coin.

1812
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:11,630
Sorry.

1813
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:12,610
This is so much to read.

1814
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:13,490
Gorilla's paw.

1815
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:14,770
Holo house.

1816
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:15,030
Yay!

1817
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:16,610

1818
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,750
Super chatto time.

1819
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,130
Target drops 20% more holocoins.

1820
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,490
All holocoins are picked up automatically.

1821
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,490
Oh, that's nice.

1822
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:28,710
Oh, that's nice.

1823
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,190
Oh, that's nice.

1824
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:33,740
Uh...

1825
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,100
Halu.

1826
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,840
Injection type Asakoko.

1827
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:39,720
Oh my god.

1828
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,720
It's the Hakkeizo!

1829
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,560
Thank you for the Hakkasupa!

1830
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:45,960
Whammy water.

1831
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,420
Okay, guys.

1832
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,880
Where do I go?

1833
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:52,420
Is it shop?

1834
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,620
Character gacha?

1835
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:55,960
Or buy upgrades?

1836
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:56,400
Oh.

1837
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,460
But I want a gacha more.

1838
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:01,400
Oh.

1839
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,740
Wait.

1840
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,800
Super chatto.

1841
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,580
Thank you guys for the super chatto!

1842
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,780
Thank you for the Hakkasupa!

1843
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,380
Water stop.

1844
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,480
Wait.

1845
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,160
What's the point of buying Myth when they're already all unlocked?

1846
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,180
Get the ultimate first.

1847
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,180
Oh.

1848
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,500
Oh, costumes.

1849
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:34,520
Outfits.

1850
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:34,760
Oh.

1851
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:35,860
Oh.

1852
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,320
Oh.

1853
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,460
What's in the armory?

1854
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:38,860
Oh.

1855
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,420
These are just the stuff that I've picked up.

1856
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,020
Um...

1857
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,400
Mock stamp system.

1858
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:50,780
Nyorodo.

1859
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:52,600
Nyorodo.

1860
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,360
Stamps may be dropped by targets which can modify the main weapon.

1861
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,560
Specials and stamps are what's good.

1862
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:00,620
Special attack?

1863
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:06,190
Wait.

1864
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:06,910
What was the stamp again?

1865
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:08,870
Unlock the...

1866
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,890
Super chatto time?

1867
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:11,790
No!

1868
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:16,890
Growth.

1869
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,170
Get stamps?

1870
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:21,730
Yeah, hold on.

1871
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,430
Let me just read what...

1872
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:22,850
Eliminate.

1873
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:28,610
Granso use of eliminate on options when leveling up, which can eliminate unwanted items for the runs.

1874
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:29,870
Uh oh.

1875
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:34,010
Reine.

1876
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,670
She's amazing at getting more coins.

1877
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:37,610
Hopefully we get her.

1878
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:37,950
Right?

1879
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:38,410
Oh.

1880
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,090
There are three tap...

1881
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:41,250
Oh.

1882
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:41,930
I see it!

1883
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,950
Oh.

1884
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,070
Oh.

1885
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:44,830
Oh!

1886
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:45,270
Thank you.

1887
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,410
I didn't notice the other tabs.

1888
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:47,690
Oh my gosh.

1889
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:48,550
Oh my gosh.

1890
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:52,390
Increase the difficulty.

1891
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:53,950
Oh...

1892
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,890
These are, like, harder.

1893
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:59,610
Refunds all purchases!

1894
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:01,410
Hardcore.

1895
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,850
Super items will not drop.

1896
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:06,530
Yo!

1897
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:11,850
If you enchant two weapons and collab them, the collab will have both enchants.

1898
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,310
Oh, interesting.

1899
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:14,290
Oh, hold on.

1900
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,630
Let me grab the stamps, right?

1901
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,870
People mentioned by that.

1902
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,690
You guys, I'm wasting all my...

1903
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:20,330
How much... hold on.

1904
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:22,090
How much is a character gacha?

1905
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,590
A thousand!

1906
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:30,450
You guys, I'm not gonna have any more!

1907
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,650
Now I can gacha?

1908
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,320
Serenade?

1909
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,570
Fauna?

1910
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,410
The tears are a pity system.

1911
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:57,110
What else can you...

1912
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,150
Get a random character.

1913
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:00,910
You're always gonna get a character though, right?

1914
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:02,670
Right?

1915
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,350
Wait, hold on.

1916
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:06,750
One...

1917
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:10,250
Two, three, four, five, six...

1918
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,070
I was gonna say...

1919
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,190
I would try for all of them, but I don't have enough.

1920
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:15,730
Like, I would do one from each.

1921
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,450
There's no filler?

1922
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:22,010
Okay, good.

1923
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,140
There's no filler?

1924
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:33,140
Okay, good.

1925
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,340
Let's just go as many as I can.

1926
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,140
Okay, here we go.

1927
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,680
Man, I love Fauna.

1928
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:57,600
Yippee!

1929
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,560
Oh my gosh.

1930
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,060
Oh yeah, people said that I would really like Sauna though, right?

1931
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,060
What is Fauna...

1932
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,040
What is she like?

1933
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:10,920
Hold on, let me see.

1934
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,400
Creates three razor-sharp leaves that spiral...

1935
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:15,700
Wait.

1936
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:16,640
Hold on.

1937
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:21,320
And then summons a giant tree that creates a healing zone?

1938
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:22,480
And then summons a giant tree that creates a healing zone?

1939
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,220
Oh my gosh.

1940
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,160
Fauna seems kinda OP.

1941
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:28,660
Fauna seems kinda OP.

1942
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,560
That is my AFK strat.

1943
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,140
Fauna is fun.

1944
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,360
Okay, let's keep going though.

1945
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,320
I'm not done.

1946
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,340
I'm gonna use all my coins, don't worry.

1947
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,620
Five bucks for the Fauna pool.

1948
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,940
It was literally free.

1949
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,310
I kinda like gamers though.

1950
01:11:58,570 --> 01:11:59,510
I like Korone.

1951
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:03,770
Waifu over meta, everybody.

1952
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,350
Waifu over meta, everybody.

1953
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:07,530
Me too.

1954
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,330
Go for Aqua?

1955
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:17,250
Let's try Aqua.

1956
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:22,570
Shubaru!

1957
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:27,450
It's because the game is sensing the hollow tori.

1958
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:28,550
You know?

1959
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:33,450
The game is sensing hollow tori.

1960
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:35,530
Shubashuba!

1961
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:37,210
Shubashuba!

1962
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:38,450
Shubashubashuba!

1963
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,490
Let's try for Reine too.

1964
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,470
Since everybody said that she's pretty good.

1965
01:12:58,670 --> 01:12:59,590
Hold on.

1966
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,130
Oh, I meant to go look at what...

1967
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,330
There was a very fast baseball in front.

1968
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:08,050
Also, I didn't read the second...

1969
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:08,530
Like these.

1970
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:10,030
Were they here before?

1971
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:15,170
Okay.

1972
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:18,250
Oh, okay.

1973
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,090
Oh, so it's because I just unlocked it.

1974
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:20,630
Got it, got it.

1975
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,090
Okay, so these are the special skills.

1976
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,290
Create a very loud scream in front.

1977
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,410
Knocking back and dealing 120% damage.

1978
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:29,290
Summon daggers that fly forward.

1979
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,330
Funya transforms into a living dagger.

1980
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,590
Becoming invincible for 10 seconds.

1981
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:34,330
Holy cow.

1982
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:38,630
Okay, we still have three more.

1983
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,370
I'll try again for Sana.

1984
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:48,130
Oh,

1985
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,460
that's not what I meant to do.

1986
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,400
We're moving.

1987
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:11,070
You know what?

1988
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:11,730
Let's just try gamers.

1989
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,670
And then I'll do Gen 1.

1990
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:14,190
Just for the heck of it.

1991
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:16,710
Okay.

1992
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:17,130
Okay.

1993
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,730
Ta-da.

1994
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:26,810
Nope.

1995
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:32,520
Nice.

1996
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:34,660
Let's see how they are.

1997
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,120
Shoots a few times and aim direction.

1998
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,340
At least we got a new person every time.

1999
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,900
Releases short discharge that deals 300% damage.

2000
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:54,820
For eight seconds, Roboco gains 100% attack speed, pickup range, and 50% crit in haste.

2001
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,540
Okay, okay.

2002
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,000
Okay, okay.

2003
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,560
Throws an Onigiri in an arc.

2004
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,500
For six seconds, Aokigyou is invincible and increases speed.

2005
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,380
Speed by 50%.

2006
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,800
I have a question about the skills.

2007
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,740
Are they like, automatic?

2008
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:13,560
Or do you trigger them?

2009
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,480
A spacebar!

2010
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,380
It's a cooldown.

2011
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,320
Got it, got it, got it.

2012
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,380
Shoot a bunch of feathers at a spread.

2013
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,520
Pierces through targets.

2014
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,320
Sorry, I was writing it.

2015
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,800
Destroy all targets in sight.

2016
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,440
Increase haste by 1% for each target as a sacrifice.

2017
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:39,000
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

2018
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:39,640
The ult.

2019
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:40,320
The ult.

2020
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:40,700
The ult.

2021
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,220
Yeah, yeah.

2022
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:44,240
Maybe I want to try Mumei.

2023
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,540
I think.

2024
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,700
I mean, sorry, not Mumei.

2025
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,200
Sorry, Fauna.

2026
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,820
I think I want to try Fauna.

2027
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,320
And... buy enchantments.

2028
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,140
Oh yeah, we still have a little bit more.

2029
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,020
What is this one?

2030
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,460
Oh, enchantments.

2031
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,920
Yeah, you know what, let's just buy...

2032
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,680
Oh, it's 1000.

2033
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:08,560
No!

2034
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,820
Okay, I can't buy it, but that's okay.

2035
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,080
Oh, the opacity.

2036
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,220
How is... where is that under?

2037
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,380
Under the graphics, I'm guessing?

2038
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,940
Oh, attack opacity.

2039
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,560
Maybe like that?

2040
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,400
Oh yeah, what's hollow house?

2041
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,020
Oh!

2042
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,460
Oh!

2043
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,160
Wait, what is this?

2044
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,140
We'll try Fauna.

2045
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:37,560
We'll try Fauna.

2046
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,180
Hollow house is addiction.

2047
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:41,820
What is it?

2048
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,580
Oh, it's a custom... Okay, yeah.

2049
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:47,720
It's a customizable house.

2050
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,920
Wait, I want Kiwawa then.

2051
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,120
Guru is here.

2052
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,180
What's this?

2053
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

2054
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,050
I got a clownfish!

2055
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,320
Wait, come on.

2056
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:20,820
Oh...

2057
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,400
Oh...

2058
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,040
Wait...

2059
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,240
Tulina!

2060
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:41,480
Shrimp!

2061
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:53,990
Tulina times 2...

2062
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,880
Is this all that there is to do in here?

2063
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,940
Because this is great.

2064
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,020
Oh, I pressed the... I pressed the...

2065
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,120
Oh, wait, wait!

2066
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:09,240
Oh, Guru left.

2067
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:09,920
She saw me struggling.

2068
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,620
I've been fishing for too long.

2069
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,460
FIVE COLD CLOWNFISH!

2070
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,240
There's a bunch?

2071
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:14,560
Oh.

2072
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:15,860
Hold on, one more.

2073
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,280
One more.

2074
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:23,620
Tuna...

2075
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:26,480
One more.

2076
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:27,720
One more.

2077
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,620
We're gonna end on a win.

2078
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:34,840
Three shrimp!

2079
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:35,740
Oh, look at them!

2080
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,020
Wait, what's this?

2081
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:37,960
That's mine.

2082
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,260
Hello.

2083
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,400
What are you trying to grab?

2084
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,080
Oh, she loves me!

2085
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,000
She loves me!

2086
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:49,520
She loves me!

2087
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,440
Wait,

2088
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,420
I have more coins!

2089
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,820
What is she trying to grab?

2090
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,300
Oh, food.

2091
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:14,840
Cook?

2092
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:17,560
Tempura?

2093
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,520
Tuna sandwich!

2094
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,800
Oh, they're waving at me.

2095
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,300
I thought they were like...

2096
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,300
I don't know.

2097
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:28,140
You know.

2098
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,360
Trying to grab me or something.

2099
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:33,220
Wow!

2100
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,600
This is so relaxing.

2101
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,400
Peckle, peckle.

2102
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:37,600
Sorry, pal.

2103
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:38,980
This road is closed for now.

2104
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,600
The Usada Casino is still under construction.

2105
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,680
Probably won't be done for some more months.

2106
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,620
Oh wait, our enemy is gonna come out and attack us.

2107
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,340
Why don't you come back another time?

2108
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,600
Okay, Peckle.

2109
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:50,820
Save us!

2110
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,640
She's working us to death, Peckle!

2111
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,740
For the princess, Peckle!

2112
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:00,480
For the princess, Peckle!

2113
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:01,960
Oh gosh, this Peckle is...

2114
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,360
Oh no, the snow soggy is dead!

2115
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:04,920
Oh wait!

2116
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,120
Oh wait, is that a rock?

2117
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,180
I can't do it!

2118
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,800
Dead body or rock?

2119
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:15,780
I can't tell!

2120
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:17,300
Wait!

2121
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,600
Oh, I can go into the forest a little bit.

2122
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:25,210
Moe-Mate!

2123
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:25,930
Hello!

2124
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:26,570
Hello!

2125
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:27,090
Hello!

2126
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:31,550
What's over here?

2127
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,390
Nothing.

2128
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:32,950
Oh!

2129
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:33,890
Bye, Moe-Mate!

2130
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:34,730
Bye, Moe-Mores!

2131
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:40,490
I want the casino!

2132
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,190
Wait!

2133
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:43,430
Kay, are you guys adding, like, blood?

2134
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,810
Blackjack?

2135
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,870
Are you guys adding blackjack to the game?

2136
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:51,970
I mean...

2137
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:55,790
What's this?

2138
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:56,830
Bye?

2139
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,470
Oh no!

2140
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,150
There's so much hair!

2141
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:08,250
Hair!

2142
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,790
There's so much hair!

2143
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:19,290
Wait, is it inside my house?

2144
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,730
Is that what I decorate in here?

2145
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:26,490
No furniture!

2146
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,850
Steal fish from another member?

2147
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:37,330
Oh, I think she's mad at me.

2148
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:38,410
Sorry.

2149
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:39,570
Oh, never mind.

2150
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,150
She's happy!

2151
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,230
She loves me!

2152
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:41,730
Sorry.

2153
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:45,250
I didn't mean to steal your fish.

2154
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:48,850
She can have this one.

2155
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,570
She can have... Oh, sorry.

2156
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:52,590
Oh my gosh.

2157
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:55,250
I'm... I'm... I'm throwing.

2158
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:56,970
Here you go!

2159
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,220
She'll definitely want these ones.

2160
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,480
No!

2161
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,020
She left!

2162
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,040
What's this?

2163
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:14,740
Bye.

2164
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,620
Dad's rod!

2165
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,800
Golden rod!

2166
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:23,900
Exchange?

2167
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:27,460
I don't have any dirt.

2168
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,540
You made her cry.

2169
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,380
No!

2170
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,200
Oh!

2171
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:39,680
Huh?

2172
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,920
Can I keep going up?

2173
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:56,260
Nope.

2174
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,450
Is there anywhere else that I can explore?

2175
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,970
How do I get rid of the fish?

2176
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:09,330
Where do I sell the fish at?

2177
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:09,950
Sell here?

2178
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,650
Oh!

2179
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:20,670
Oh, so you can catch it or you can cook it.

2180
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:22,570
I see, I see.

2181
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:24,470
Now I have dirt.

2182
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,730
Okay.

2183
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:28,830
Oh, I need so much dirt for Dad's rod!

2184
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:31,330
Dang it.

2185
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:34,010
Talk to all the NPCs.

2186
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,170
I think I have.

2187
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,430
Or did I miss anybody?

2188
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:38,350
Oh, there's the billboard.

2189
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:39,070
Or bulletin board.

2190
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:41,590
Hire.

2191
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,090
Send out an advertisement to get recruits.

2192
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:46,310
For what?

2193
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,170
There's a talk option.

2194
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:51,150
Wait, what are you talking about?

2195
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,310
Oh, here?

2196
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:58,400
Oh, you're right!

2197
01:23:59,120 --> 01:23:59,820
Good day to you.

2198
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,400
I'm Nemu!

2199
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,820
I'm looking after this farm for Fada!

2200
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,260
Oh my gosh, my Kamiyoshi's name is Nemu.

2201
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,200
Here you can help raise crops to use however you'd like.

2202
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:16,300
As a representative of Mother Nature herself, we would be happy for you to help us grow all sorts of different plants.

2203
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:21,900
To get started, you can buy some special farming soils as well as seeds from me.

2204
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:27,140
Then simply select one of the eight farming spots and then choose a combination of soil and seed.

2205
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,800
Of course, plants will take some time to grow, but don't worry.

2206
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:37,380
If you decide to go somewhere else, I'll look over the plants for you while you're gone.

2207
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,600
They'll continue to grow.

2208
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:46,440
Now, all plants love water as it helps them grow, so if you take time to water the plants, they will grow faster.

2209
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:51,360
Thanks to my special magic, the plants on this farm will never die, so you can rest easy.

2210
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,740
By the way, I have three different kinds of soils you can buy.

2211
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:59,320
Our standard soil has no special properties, but it's very cheap and affordable.

2212
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,520
Then we have our expedited soil, which speeds up plant growth by 40%.

2213
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,320
You just left it there!

2214
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,160
What are you doing?

2215
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,920
What are you doing?

2216
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,040
You just left it there!

2217
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,980
She's mad at me!

2218
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,320
I'll make kills for sport.

2219
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,980
I'm taking what she's having.

2220
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,560
Whatever she grabs.

2221
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,340
There she goes.

2222
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:50,500
Into the forest.

2223
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,340
Into the woods.

2224
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,920
Never to be seen again.

2225
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:57,220
Read.

2226
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,360
You read the notes written on the bulletin board.

2227
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,100
Here you can recruit volunteers looking for work.

2228
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:06,620
These workers will help you slowly make money, just as long as you keep them well-fed.

2229
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,700
First, you will have to pay an initial...

2230
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:10,320
Oh my gosh, it's raining!

2231
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:10,940
So cute!

2232
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,320
...an initial cost to send the workers home.

2233
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:19,380
Then, as long as they have the stamina, they will continue working by themselves and generate holocoins for you, whether you are here or not.

2234
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,440
Wow!

2235
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:26,160
Workers are all different and have their own strengths and weaknesses.

2236
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,160
Workers have the following stats.

2237
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,760
Stamina, how long they can work before they become exhausted.

2238
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,460
I mean...

2239
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,100
Exhausted is like...

2240
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,260
It's subjective, right?

2241
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,820
Exhausted is subjective, right?

2242
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,260
If they can...

2243
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:44,840
You know...

2244
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,240
If they have legs, then they can work!

2245
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,610
How many holocoins they can gather at once.

2246
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:58,110
How quickly the workers can grow and improve.

2247
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:00,870
The limit a worker can grow to.

2248
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:07,750
As you feed your worker, not only do they recover their stamina, but they will also gain EXP.

2249
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:12,810
After gaining a certain amount of EXP, a worker will level up and increase their base stats, such as stamina and efficiency.

2250
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:13,890
...

2251
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:13,910
...

2252
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:15,610
Like a herdsman!

2253
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:16,930
Sort of.

2254
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:19,010
Okay next.

2255
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:25,550
Is everything okay today?

2256
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:26,130
What happened this morning?

2257
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,570
How are you.

2258
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:30,950
My name is部팀 I'll take your place for a moment.

2259
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:31,570
Your name is 備物 It's a direct reflection.

2260
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:32,550
I watch you.

2261
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:34,210
What are you doing?

2262
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,610
domlegiri It's me, Do Allies!

2263
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:42,510
And so do I.

2264
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:42,810
Yes, it is.

2265
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:43,890
I'm very你要.

2266
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,960
How silly.

2267
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:01,520
I liked that.

2268
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,200
Scatter!

2269
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,460
Literally fades into the bushes.

2270
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,140
Okay.

2271
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:11,740
This was very cute.

2272
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,820
I liked that.

2273
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:15,320
But I do want to play more.

2274
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,020
Play stage mode.

2275
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,620
I want to play the hollow office.

2276
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,000
I want to play as Fauna.

2277
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,060
I want to try.

2278
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,680
I'll do my best.

2279
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,840
Oh, it says recommended upgrades.

2280
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,220
Maybe I should do the upgrades then.

2281
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:36,460
Let me hold on.

2282
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,460
I think I have enough.

2283
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:37,920
Don't I?

2284
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:41,820
Yeah.

2285
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:42,880
Oh!

2286
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,260
How did I get so much money?

2287
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,180
Wait, where did all this money come from?

2288
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,200
Where did all this money come from?

2289
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,120
Where did all this money come from?

2290
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,200
The fish!

2291
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,440
Attack level 2.

2292
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,320
This is, I'm guessing, level 1.

2293
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:06,580
Right?

2294
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,420
So that's level 2.

2295
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,440
And then what was the other one?

2296
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:08,640
Speed?

2297
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:14,430
Okay.

2298
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,150
And then I can also buy...

2299
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:18,110
Oh wait, this one.

2300
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,630
Yippee!

2301
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:22,770
Okay.

2302
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:24,530
Let's go.

2303
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:26,450
I'm just going to try it.

2304
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,090
I'm just going to try it, okay?

2305
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:32,770
We're just going to try it.

2306
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,130
If we die, we die.

2307
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:45,540
Oh, there's no, like, aiming because...

2308
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,400
I guess that makes sense.

2309
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,020
Oh my gosh, Fauna.

2310
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,740
Her attacks, like...

2311
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,160
It's so, it's so wide of a range.

2312
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,040
Nice!

2313
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,140
Oh, the click to aim!

2314
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:03,580
That's right!

2315
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,480
I forgot about that.

2316
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,980
Wow, there's so many new things!

2317
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:12,760
When healing, a branch will grow under a random nearby target, dealing 200% damage.

2318
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,000
Aww.

2319
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:21,350
So, each character also has their own set of, like...

2320
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:21,610
Okay.

2321
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:22,970
The skills and stuff.

2322
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:31,150
Defeated targets have a 5% chance to drop saplings.

2323
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:34,210
Sapling heals 3% and increases Fauna's attack and speed.

2324
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:35,510
Ooh, that seems good.

2325
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:39,610
I see a lot of people saying 3.

2326
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:42,010
I think it's probably good to go and...

2327
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:48,970
aim for leveling up the base weapon first.

2328
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:49,930
I get it.

2329
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:50,550
I get it.

2330
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:51,250
I get it, you guys.

2331
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:53,870
It's usually how I play, anyway.

2332
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:54,670
So...

2333
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:57,450
Oh, that's right.

2334
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:58,010
I need to...

2335
01:30:59,310 --> 01:30:59,930
You know what?

2336
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:00,650
In fact, I'm even.

2337
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,370
Oh, but the Psycho Axe!

2338
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,420
It does reduce the time...

2339
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,540
Oh, it was messaging me.

2340
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:12,340
Oh my gosh, hold on.

2341
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,100
Still one?

2342
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:20,780
Okay.

2343
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,600
Oh, there it is.

2344
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:23,060
The left click.

2345
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:24,500
Am I actually aiming, though?

2346
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,100
I don't think I am.

2347
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:25,740
Hahaha.

2348
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,740
Oh, I don't really need the health, but whatever.

2349
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,100
I don't think I'm actually aiming.

2350
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:31,920
It's fine, though.

2351
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,360
I just like to have it.

2352
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,300
Oh, oop, oop, oop, oop.

2353
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,040
Two additional leaves!

2354
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:39,740
There we go.

2355
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2356
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:41,280
Give me that.

2357
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:42,260
Oop!

2358
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:44,440
Ouchie ouch!

2359
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,160
Oh, what's that?

2360
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,140
What's this?

2361
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,140
A haste up stamp.

2362
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:53,900
Place this...

2363
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:54,480
Oh?

2364
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:55,780
What do I do?

2365
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:56,860
Oh!

2366
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:57,160
Oh!

2367
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:58,960
Apply?

2368
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:01,480
Hmm?

2369
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:02,600
Confirm?

2370
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,300
Finish?

2371
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:13,880
Oh my gosh, this level is so narrow.

2372
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:14,720
Okay.

2373
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:15,340
Hahaha.

2374
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,780
This level is so narrow.

2375
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:20,380
Hahaha.

2376
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,960
Oh, there's something else up there.

2377
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:23,380
What's that?

2378
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:24,420
Is that another stamp?

2379
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:29,600
Oh!

2380
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:30,900
Oh!

2381
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:30,980
Oh!

2382
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:31,580
Oh!

2383
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,600
Increase damage 5% for each empty weapon slot.

2384
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:41,580
It's good now.

2385
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:42,160
Yes.

2386
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,280
It's good right now.

2387
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,560
Am I able to get rid of them once I...

2388
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:54,630
Yeah, you can?

2389
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:55,210
Okay, cool.

2390
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:58,310
Nice.

2391
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:58,570
Oh!

2392
01:32:59,230 --> 01:32:59,690
Hahaha.

2393
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,560
This level is so narrow.

2394
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,300
Oh, health.

2395
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,020
Let's grab it.

2396
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:18,820
Yeepee!

2397
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,640
Nature shield awakened.

2398
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:23,100
All right, guys.

2399
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:23,920
Whoa!

2400
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,040
Oh my god.

2401
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:27,740
Hahaha.

2402
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,360
Here they come.

2403
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:32,860
Here they come.

2404
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:33,680
Here we go.

2405
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,220
Save that Borg.

2406
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:41,300
A little bit.

2407
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,520
Oh, no.

2408
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,800
Okie dokie.

2409
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:50,880
You lose 5% HP every second?

2410
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,100
Oh my gosh.

2411
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,080
That's insanity.

2412
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,580
Now, gain 1% EXP for 2 seconds when HP is full.

2413
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,680
The EXP slowly increases.

2414
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:00,280
Oh!

2415
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,580
Let's try it.

2416
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:02,860
Yeah.

2417
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,060
Getting more EXP sounds good.

2418
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,320
In my opinion.

2419
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:08,740
What's on TV?

2420
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,460
We got Koyori.

2421
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,000
Volca.

2422
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:13,620
Laplace.

2423
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,080
Roboco.

2424
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:14,600
I don't know.

2425
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:14,640
What's on TV?

2426
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,540
Everything is on TV, you guys.

2427
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,160
They can't make up their mind.

2428
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:18,720
They're just...

2429
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,940
They're going through everything.

2430
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,740
It's literally whatever you want is on TV.

2431
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,180
Oh my gosh.

2432
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,470
Oh!

2433
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:40,330
Yippee!

2434
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:42,930
Huh?

2435
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:45,750
They got the slideshow.

2436
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:46,330
Hahaha.

2437
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:49,130
When in danger, use the ultimate.

2438
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:49,450
Yes.

2439
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,210
It's space, right?

2440
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:50,730
It's space.

2441
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:51,530
Oh!

2442
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:52,050
The sapling!

2443
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:53,990
Yeah.

2444
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:54,710
Let's go with the sapling.

2445
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,100
Yippee!

2446
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:03,960
Hahaha.

2447
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,580
I shall take it.

2448
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:13,450
But I don't want to...

2449
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,570
The sapling...

2450
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:15,070
Oh!

2451
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,130
Look how cute he is!

2452
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:20,510
I don't want to take too many weapons right now just because we...

2453
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:21,950
Um...

2454
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,030
We have the...

2455
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:26,290
That one skill.

2456
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,550
That one stamp, right?

2457
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:29,630
So...

2458
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:32,030
Oh my goodness.

2459
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:33,310
Get out of my way.

2460
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:34,530
Get out of my way!

2461
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:40,390
Put him in the soup.

2462
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:41,470
Hahaha.

2463
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,030
Oh

2464
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:47,860
no!

2465
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,880
My psychoaxe!

2466
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,660
Ignore the stamp.

2467
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,160
Get weapons.

2468
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,060
Oh!

2469
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:54,140
Oh!

2470
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:56,380
Okay.

2471
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:01,350
What did the saplings do again?

2472
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:03,330
It was like healing HP or something.

2473
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:06,730
What the...

2474
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:07,250
Oh!

2475
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:07,570
Oh!

2476
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:08,670
Scared me.

2477
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:12,410
Stamps can be swapped in and out.

2478
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,010
Okay.

2479
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:15,810
I'll remember.

2480
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:16,490
Oh!

2481
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:18,590
Ahem.

2482
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,110
Oh!

2483
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:22,170
It heals and makes you go fast.

2484
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,490
Okay.

2485
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:22,670
Cool.

2486
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:22,810
Cool.

2487
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:22,950
Cool.

2488
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:23,630
Thank you.

2489
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:23,950
Thank you.

2490
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:27,650
Do we want to...

2491
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:31,850
Defeat targets have a 7% chance of drop sapling, heals, and...

2492
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,330
Oh.

2493
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:34,030
That's what I'm gonna go with.

2494
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,900
Max out on XP early.

2495
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:44,600
You know what?

2496
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,040
That's so true.

2497
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:46,580
It's a good point.

2498
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:48,300
It's a good point.

2499
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:49,200
Okay.

2500
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,100
Come here, little saplings.

2501
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,300
I see you over there.

2502
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:52,000
Weee!

2503
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:53,260
Hahaha.

2504
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:55,340
Oh my gosh.

2505
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,180
They're gonna explodey.

2506
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,560
Oh!

2507
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,460
There's so many coins up here.

2508
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:05,960
Hello?

2509
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:07,840
Jackpot.

2510
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:08,820
Hahaha.

2511
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:21,990
Um...

2512
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:22,030
Oh!

2513
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:22,570
Oh!

2514
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:26,730
Gain one coin for every 100 pixels traveled.

2515
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:27,550
Huuuh!

2516
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:29,990
Uh-oh.

2517
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:30,970
Use the special?

2518
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:31,630
I don't need to.

2519
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:33,510
Because I'm all full of health.

2520
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:35,750
There's a box to the right.

2521
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:35,950
Oh!

2522
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:36,170
Is there?

2523
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:38,250
I'm gonna do...

2524
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:39,370
Increase my saplings.

2525
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:41,430
Oh!

2526
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:41,790
Wait.

2527
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:42,430
There's a box.

2528
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:42,930
Oh!

2529
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:43,310
Ouch!

2530
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:43,930
Hahaha.

2531
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:47,890
Oh!

2532
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:48,270
There it is.

2533
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:48,710
I see it.

2534
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:49,430
Woah!

2535
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:50,530
Nice.

2536
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:52,150
Okay.

2537
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,240
Oh!

2538
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,180
You're a specialist surrounded by enemies.

2539
01:37:59,440 --> 01:37:59,880
Okay, okay.

2540
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,220
Because it grants me invulnerability, right?

2541
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,920
You guys just want the Super Chatto time!

2542
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,320
You guys just want the Super Chatto time!

2543
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,160
Four for gacha.

2544
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:20,970
I want to do the BL book, but...

2545
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:24,690
Okay, okay, okay.

2546
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:26,910
One.

2547
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:28,870
Whoa, what are the stars for?

2548
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:31,670
Hi, dog!

2549
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:38,610
Two!

2550
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:41,910
Love the content.

2551
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,290
Hashtag first timer.

2552
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:44,570
Oh, thank you!

2553
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:45,470
Three?

2554
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:46,450
Wait, the guardian tree?

2555
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:50,330
Oh, it increases your ultimate meter.

2556
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:50,910
Got it, got it.

2557
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:51,350
Thanks, guys.

2558
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:53,230
Thank you, thank you!

2559
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:55,330
Okay.

2560
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:57,410
The guardian tree, then.

2561
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:00,350
Three is damage.

2562
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:01,590
One makes three better.

2563
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,550
Well, yeah, every 10 seconds gain one whisper.

2564
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:06,530
Each stack heals.

2565
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:08,550
I think we're good on it.

2566
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:10,150
This is... We'll do this one, though.

2567
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:13,290
Yeah, we gotta get these saplings.

2568
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:16,490
Little baby saplings are so lonely.

2569
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:18,270
Whoa!

2570
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:18,730
Whoa!

2571
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,090
Oh, that was awesome!

2572
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,210
That was the tree branch.

2573
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:24,070
Hiya!

2574
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:24,830
Hiya!

2575
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:25,970
Hiya!

2576
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:26,250
Hiya!

2577
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:29,830
Hiya!

2578
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:30,510
I don't know what they're gonna do.

2579
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:33,230
This.

2580
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:35,750
Okay, okay, I see, I see.

2581
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:36,250
Whoo!

2582
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:37,830
What?

2583
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:40,110
Hyah!

2584
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:40,470
Oh!

2585
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:41,270
Hyah!

2586
01:39:41,650 --> 01:39:43,030
Okay, it's like kind of random.

2587
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:44,150
Or maybe, I think.

2588
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:53,350
Super chat time!

2589
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:54,370
I'll take it.

2590
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:57,850
Oh, that lava bucket.

2591
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:59,130
Oh, wait!

2592
01:39:59,290 --> 01:39:59,410
Oh!

2593
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:06,430
I think getting more saplings might be good.

2594
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:11,330
Two or four?

2595
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:13,530
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm in between about.

2596
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:16,110
I do want the bucket, but...

2597
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,930
I think the bucket is...

2598
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:20,830
Buckets are good in these kinds of areas because they're so contained.

2599
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:22,510
You know, like it's so narrow.

2600
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:24,210
It's good to have something like that.

2601
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:25,330
Five.

2602
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,210
Oh, look at you.

2603
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,650
The secret option.

2604
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:28,350
Five!

2605
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,750
Hmm...

2606
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,030
Bucket has an enchant on it.

2607
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:37,090
Maybe I should just grab it.

2608
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:42,480
Since it's here.

2609
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,280
Bucket plus axe?

2610
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:47,580
Oh, really?

2611
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,200
Okay, I'm just gonna grab it.

2612
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:53,940
I know it's probably not as wise because I should be focusing on enhancing everything else.

2613
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,180
And making it stronger rather than, you know...

2614
01:40:58,720 --> 01:40:59,200
Yeah...

2615
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,080
But... But!

2616
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,240
But!

2617
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:03,840
Hear me out.

2618
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,260
Super chat time.

2619
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:13,990
It looks like pizza.

2620
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:14,850
It makes me hungry.

2621
01:41:17,330 --> 01:41:18,730
Which one should we get?

2622
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:22,730
Maybe the book.

2623
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:23,610
Wait.

2624
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:26,130
Actually, my axe.

2625
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:27,370
Maybe my axe.

2626
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:29,090
The coat?

2627
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:30,130
We can't do the coat.

2628
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,220
Oh wait!

2629
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:37,640
Enchant!

2630
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,700
Weapon gains random bonus effects.

2631
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,260
Is there already bonus effects?

2632
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:41,540
Wait.

2633
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,520
What's the bucket's enchant?

2634
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:45,840
Crit damage 10%?

2635
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:54,720
Enchant costs coins.

2636
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,020
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2637
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,780
Maybe I should just regular upgrade then right now?

2638
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:02,400
Oh gosh.

2639
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,740
All these extra things are hurting my brain.

2640
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:05,520
Hahahaha.

2641
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,640
It already has an enchantment.

2642
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,520
Oh, is that why it's blue?

2643
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,580
And then the BL book also has an enchantment?

2644
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:19,680
So, the axe needs the enchantment!

2645
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:20,600
Ahhh!

2646
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:25,200
250.

2647
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,200
Okay.

2648
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,180
It's fine.

2649
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,020
We got super chat time.

2650
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:31,120
Come here, sapling.

2651
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,960
Come here, sapling.

2652
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:33,960
Hehehe.

2653
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:34,080
Hehehe.

2654
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:35,900
Cha!

2655
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:39,780
Oh.

2656
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:42,840
Super chat time.

2657
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:45,080
Hehehe.

2658
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:46,280
Hehehe.

2659
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:46,680
Hehehe.

2660
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:47,700
Hehehe.

2661
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:47,720
Hehehe.

2662
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:47,840
Hehehe.

2663
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:48,900
Eat the pizza.

2664
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,400
Eat the pizza.

2665
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:50,980
Woo!

2666
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:53,480
Hohohoho.

2667
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:54,660
Awesome.

2668
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,200
I can't.

2669
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,360
I haven't forgot about my ult, you guys.

2670
01:42:59,420 --> 01:42:59,800
Don't worry.

2671
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:02,580
I'm like saving it.

2672
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:03,520
I'm saving it.

2673
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:07,560
Mmmmmmmm.

2674
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,620
This body pillow though...

2675
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,000
The body pillow helped me a lot before.

2676
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,880
The body pillow helped me a ton.

2677
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,380
Anything but three.

2678
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:22,440
Mmmmmmm.

2679
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:29,540
I...

2680
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:33,060
Think I'll go for the sapling.

2681
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:34,280
There we go.

2682
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:36,220
Wohoo!

2683
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:46,900
I'm trying to grab the saplings.

2684
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,580
I'm gonna do the BL book this time.

2685
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:56,240
Oh wait, this will be maxed out though.

2686
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,500
Okay, never mind.

2687
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:58,660
Just kidding.

2688
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:03,340
I changed my mind.

2689
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:04,500
I'm greedy.

2690
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:07,200
I changed my mind.

2691
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:07,640
I'm so greedy.

2692
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,560
Yeah!

2693
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,180
Wait, don't come this way!

2694
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:12,820
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

2695
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,260
That was a sapling!

2696
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,840
No sapling left behind.

2697
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:23,140
More money!

2698
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:25,380
Oh, everything is new.

2699
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:26,780
Two?

2700
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,120
Is Whisperer that good?

2701
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,060
It's kinda creeping me out.

2702
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:34,980
Oh, I...

2703
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:37,940
Oh...

2704
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:46,460
It's her skill.

2705
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:47,220
Oh, it is?

2706
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,240
Oh, I see it.

2707
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:50,560
It does say skill.

2708
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:53,640
Oh my gosh.

2709
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,560
Oh my gosh.

2710
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,040
Oh gosh.

2711
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,640
Ouchie ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch.

2712
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:00,400
I'm getting greed.

2713
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,300
Oh, I'm getting careless.

2714
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:02,320
I'm getting a little careless.

2715
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,660
Careless Whisperer.

2716
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:07,600
Ouchie ouch ouch.

2717
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:08,560
Oh my gosh.

2718
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:09,680
Oh my gosh.

2719
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,720
Ouch ouch ouch!

2720
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,060
You guys, not good.

2721
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:13,420
Not good.

2722
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:14,600
Not good.

2723
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:14,940
Not good.

2724
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:16,340
Where's the burger?

2725
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,380
Where's the burgers?

2726
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:19,700
Where the burgers at?

2727
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,020
I'm trying to grab saplings, but they're so far...

2728
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,200
Oh!

2729
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:24,500
Oh my god.

2730
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:24,960
Oh...

2731
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,400
Oh,

2732
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:28,900
the special!

2733
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:30,000
Thank you guys.

2734
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:30,540
Okay.

2735
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:33,260
You know how I said I forgot about... I didn't forget about the special earlier?

2736
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,140
Wait, is it X or is it space?

2737
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,440
Some people said X.

2738
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:42,480
Space?

2739
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:42,840
Okay.

2740
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:44,620
Um...

2741
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,040
Uh...

2742
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:53,600
Oh.

2743
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:54,760
Um...

2744
01:45:59,230 --> 01:45:59,750
Okay.

2745
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:01,190
Oh, space did not work.

2746
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:04,110
So, maybe it is X.

2747
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:09,030
Yeah,

2748
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,140
I'll take it.

2749
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,140
Try shift?

2750
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:15,740
Okay.

2751
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,700
Or right click?

2752
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:19,760
Shift or right click?

2753
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:20,180
Shift or right click?

2754
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,440
Uh...

2755
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:27,260
Oh!

2756
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:30,220
Yeah!

2757
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:31,500
Oh gosh.

2758
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,020
Oh gosh.

2759
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:32,320
Oh gosh.

2760
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:36,080
I don't know how long... How long am I invincible for?

2761
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,460
Oh, I'm... I don't think I'm invincible anymore?

2762
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:42,640
Psycho Axe.

2763
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,920
And we're all healed baby.

2764
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:48,520
Wee!

2765
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:49,140
Wee!

2766
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,020
Wee!

2767
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:54,100
We are all healed up.

2768
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,960
Yummy, yummy sapling.

2769
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:06,500
Yummy, yummy sapling.

2770
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:08,940
There's a timer in the bottom left?

2771
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:09,580
Okay, cool.

2772
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,120
Thank you.

2773
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:15,620
Whisper.

2774
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:17,160
How do I consume the whisper?

2775
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:21,660
Oh, I see how it works.

2776
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:21,840
Okay.

2777
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,260
Will you play Maid of the Dead again soon?

2778
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:25,260
Maybe.

2779
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:28,020
Automatic.

2780
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:28,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2781
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,000
Whisper.

2782
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:34,960
Whisper.

2783
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:35,340
That's me.

2784
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,140
Well, you know, that's you actually.

2785
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,120
Whispers.

2786
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:39,700
What's this?

2787
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,960
Is it because it's a PC?

2788
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:50,240
Not the potato PC.

2789
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,420
Attacks have 20% chance to slow targets.

2790
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,660
I mean, why not, right?

2791
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,560
The pull-tato.

2792
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:01,840
Sorry.

2793
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,100
The pull-tato PC.

2794
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:03,960
Yes, yes, yes.

2795
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:06,440
Yes, yes, yes.

2796
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:07,660
Oh my gosh.

2797
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:08,940
Yowza.

2798
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:09,700
Oh my gosh.

2799
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:10,820
Yowza!

2800
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:13,960
Yow!

2801
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,240
Eep.

2802
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:23,680
Eep.

2803
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:24,500
Eep.

2804
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:25,180
Eep.

2805
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:25,960
Nice.

2806
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,160
Eep.

2807
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:28,320
Eep.

2808
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:28,320
Eep.

2809
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:28,320
Eep.

2810
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:28,320
Nice.

2811
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:28,880
Eep.

2812
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:29,520
Eep.

2813
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,180
Eep.

2814
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:30,400
Eep.

2815
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:32,680
We're slowing them down a little bit.

2816
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,220
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

2817
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:36,900
No, no, no.

2818
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:38,960
Oh my gosh.

2819
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:39,980
We took a lot of damage there.

2820
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:43,020
Oh my gosh.

2821
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,360
We're not even halfway through the stage.

2822
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,040
Maybe I should do uber sheep.

2823
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:50,740
I think I should uber sheep because I'm taking a lot of damage.

2824
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:51,400
Oop.

2825
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:51,860
My bad.

2826
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:56,860
Ubersheep.

2827
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:57,240
Ubersheep.

2828
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,140
Ubersheep.

2829
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,720
I'm guessing these are the onigiri for Okayu.

2830
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:07,440
Oh my gosh.

2831
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,560
Oh my gosh.

2832
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:09,120
Oh my gosh.

2833
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:09,580
Oh my gosh.

2834
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:10,400
Ouch!

2835
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:16,010
Who's aiming for me?

2836
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:16,790
Who's attacking me?

2837
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:17,550
Oh my gosh.

2838
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:18,210
My game stuttered.

2839
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:21,470
Come here.

2840
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:23,150
No saplings left behind.

2841
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:24,810
No saplings left behind!

2842
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:31,280
Not the table.

2843
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:32,320
Oh my gosh.

2844
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,440
How?

2845
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,320
For the skills?

2846
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,120
What's the max level they can get?

2847
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,860
Need more DPS.

2848
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:53,540
I agree.

2849
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:54,860
I agree.

2850
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,060
So I think I'll go with the book.

2851
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:03,170
Ooh!

2852
01:50:03,890 --> 01:50:04,790
Nice, nice.

2853
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:06,990
Oh, nice, nice.

2854
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:08,870
Oh!

2855
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:09,590
Nice, nice.

2856
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:16,430
You guys, I lucked out on those first three boxes and then never again.

2857
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:22,040
Whisper's DPS with the trees.

2858
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:24,060
She speaks for the trees.

2859
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:27,340
Okay, then we'll do Whisper here.

2860
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:35,100
Oh my gosh.

2861
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:36,660
Yago!

2862
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:39,580
Oh, he's dropping cash.

2863
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:40,920
Yippee!

2864
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:41,780
Silver Yago!

2865
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:46,240
Oh, my spider cooking.

2866
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,540
Create a splash of unknown water in front.

2867
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:56,960
The whammy water is good.

2868
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:01,280
Sorry.

2869
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:02,940
Oh, choices to make here.

2870
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:03,300
I know.

2871
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:07,840
Oh.

2872
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:13,450
It's either... I feel...

2873
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:15,590
But also the elite lava.

2874
01:51:24,930 --> 01:51:26,450
Water and BL is a collab.

2875
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:31,710
But also BL and Axe was a collab, so...

2876
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:33,950
BL water is good.

2877
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:38,890
I guess we haven't seen that one before, so I do want to see it.

2878
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:39,550
We can try it.

2879
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:42,570
Since I haven't seen it, you know?

2880
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:48,490
I'm all for experimenting since I haven't played the game before, you know?

2881
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:49,950
So I want to try out...

2882
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:56,850
Rather than sticking to the same old things just because they worked before, I like to try out different combinations and stuff too, you know?

2883
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:57,030
You know?

2884
01:51:59,570 --> 01:51:59,930
Yeah.

2885
01:52:01,390 --> 01:52:03,110
I'm gonna go with the water...

2886
01:52:03,110 --> 01:52:03,810
Oh, actually, no.

2887
01:52:03,870 --> 01:52:04,510
I'm gonna go with the...

2888
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:06,570
Four?

2889
01:52:07,110 --> 01:52:07,750
What is four?

2890
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:09,010
Chris, regular friend.

2891
01:52:11,730 --> 01:52:12,890
Are you guys trying to kill me?

2892
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:13,970
Yeah, four?

2893
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:15,290
Are you guys trying to kill me?

2894
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:18,770
I think you guys are trying to kill me.

2895
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:21,750
I think you guys are literally trolling me right now.

2896
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:24,950
You guys are...

2897
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,410
I don't trust you at all.

2898
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:28,550
In this situation.

2899
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:31,410
Please kindly go fuck yourself.

2900
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:31,950
Okay?

2901
01:52:32,010 --> 01:52:34,370
Thank you very much for your suggestion.

2902
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:37,090
And also, it has been vetoed.

2903
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:37,990
Wow!

2904
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:39,130
Oh my gosh.

2905
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:39,770
I just right clicked.

2906
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:40,530
You know what?

2907
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:41,390
Actually, this works out.

2908
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:44,430
This is probably a good time to right click.

2909
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:46,790
This is an okay time to right click.

2910
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:47,510
Actually.

2911
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:48,390
Yippee!

2912
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:48,470
Yippee!

2913
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:54,590
Psycho ass.

2914
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,500
Yip!

2915
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:00,800
Oh!

2916
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:01,300
Flower.

2917
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,300
Weakened stamp.

2918
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:06,980
Attacks have a 20% chance to reduce attack and defense of targets.

2919
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:08,480
Flower.

2920
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:10,880
Flower.

2921
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:16,760
Flower.

2922
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:19,640
I guess probably this one.

2923
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:24,270
No!

2924
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:28,450
I think I should sell it though, huh?

2925
01:53:29,150 --> 01:53:30,090
But it's just like...

2926
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:30,510
It's just...

2927
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:32,290
Oh, it's so sad in this context.

2928
01:53:33,330 --> 01:53:36,550
Oh my god.

2929
01:53:36,590 --> 01:53:36,710
Wait.

2930
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:38,450
If you sell it...

2931
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:38,990
Like...

2932
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:41,730
It means it won't drop again in this run, right?

2933
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:42,590
Or forever?

2934
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:46,050
Use it for strengthen.

2935
01:53:47,770 --> 01:53:48,210
Ah!

2936
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:48,950
I see.

2937
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:49,210
I see.

2938
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,770
Okay.

2939
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,170
Swap and then use this.

2940
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:51,950
Oh.

2941
01:53:52,650 --> 01:53:53,090
Wait.

2942
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:54,570
Ah!

2943
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:58,010
Wait.

2944
01:53:58,050 --> 01:53:58,530
How do I...

2945
01:53:59,670 --> 01:53:59,950
Oh!

2946
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:00,390
I see!

2947
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:00,630
I see!

2948
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:00,950
I see!

2949
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:01,130
I see!

2950
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:01,250
I see!

2951
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:02,030
Okay.

2952
01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:02,310
Okay.

2953
01:54:02,370 --> 01:54:02,510
Okay.

2954
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:02,670
Okay.

2955
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:05,270
What was...

2956
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:06,490
Oh, this is the haste.

2957
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:07,910
Um...

2958
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:09,110
Okay.

2959
01:54:09,170 --> 01:54:09,610
I get it now.

2960
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:09,990
I get it.

2961
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:11,890
Um...

2962
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:13,790
Probably flower then, right?

2963
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:14,750
Wait.

2964
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:15,990
Reduce the time between...

2965
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:16,070
Oh!

2966
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:16,450
Never mind.

2967
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:17,070
Reduce the time...

2968
01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:17,230
Okay.

2969
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,510
Never mind.

2970
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:17,690
Yes.

2971
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,810
Strength and haste.

2972
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:26,830
For some reason, in my head, I was thinking haste is like...

2973
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:30,870
Is like running speed, you know what I mean?

2974
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:34,250
Oh my god!

2975
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:35,150
Elite!

2976
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:58,130
4 credit card?

2977
01:54:58,550 --> 01:55:00,250
No, I think I'm gonna go with...

2978
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:02,330
I'm gonna go with Psycho Axe.

2979
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:05,490
RGB stamp!

2980
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:07,630
Weapon attacks will look pretty.

2981
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:17,690
Which one do I get rid of?

2982
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:19,730
Replace flower with this?

2983
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:30,230
And then...

2984
01:55:30,910 --> 01:55:31,610
Oh no!

2985
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:35,790
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

2986
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:36,970
I accidentally closed out of it.

2987
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:38,450
Strengthen it?

2988
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:38,990
Okay.

2989
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:42,130
Nothing will...

2990
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:43,450
What happens if I'm leveling this up?

2991
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:44,770
What are you expecting it to do?

2992
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:45,510
Rainbow harder?

2993
01:55:45,650 --> 01:55:46,610
I wanna see a rainbow!

2994
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:47,770
Wow!

2995
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:48,790
It looks so pretty!

2996
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:50,090
Oh my gosh.

2997
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:51,550
Aesthetics are worth it, you guys.

2998
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:53,770
Actually...

2999
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:55,750
Everything is like...

3000
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:57,670
Very hard to see right now.

3001
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:01,690
It does look nice.

3002
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:02,490
It does, yeah.

3003
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:04,110
It does look really nice.

3004
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:06,950
There are no items to steal...

3005
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:07,070
Hmn...

3006
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:13,810
Stay away!

3007
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:15,710
Yyyyyy BOO.

3008
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:19,510
Oh, I didn't mean to grab that.

3009
01:56:19,590 --> 01:56:20,130
Oh, there's some...

3010
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:22,110
High-level ones over here.

3011
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:24,290
Oh my gosh, I got stuck on something.

3012
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:26,230
There we go.

3013
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:26,910
Yeah-yeah-yeah.

3014
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:30,310
Whammy water.

3015
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:32,850
Or the axe.

3016
01:56:33,170 --> 01:56:33,890
Remove hit limit.

3017
01:56:33,890 --> 01:56:34,110
Damn it.

3018
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:35,690
I'm going to go with that one.

3019
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:41,670
Where is Miko?

3020
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:42,990
Oh, there she is.

3021
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:45,250
She's clipping through the table, you guys.

3022
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,620
Ah, let's see.

3023
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:06,300
If I upgrade this, it...

3024
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:09,580
It is free.

3025
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:09,960
Yeah!

3026
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,780
Okay, run away.

3027
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:21,340
Oh, my lava buckets are looking pretty spicy down there.

3028
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,540
We burnted the pizza.

3029
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:25,740
We burnted the pizza!

3030
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:26,300
No!

3031
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:28,720
Wait, no sapling left behind.

3032
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:30,440
I'll come back for you!

3033
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,100
Oh my gosh, she's just plowing on through.

3034
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:32,760
There we go.

3035
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:35,220
We got her back, boys!

3036
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:38,180
Oops.

3037
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,300
Ouchie, ouchie.

3038
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,340
That's not good.

3039
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:46,280
That's her lava?

3040
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:47,040
Wait, what?

3041
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:47,760
Oh!

3042
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:49,060
Oh.

3043
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,200
Oh.

3044
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:51,640
Oh.

3045
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:52,140
Oh.

3046
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:52,440
Oh.

3047
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:03,530
I'm just running on through, thinking that I'm totally fine here.

3048
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:05,350
Oh my gosh, there's so much here.

3049
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:07,630
So I think it's probably good to...

3050
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:09,410
Yes!

3051
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:11,010
Eat it up.

3052
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:12,690
Eat it up.

3053
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:18,550
I think I'm going to go for the sake.

3054
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:19,650
Okay.

3055
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,200
I can't decide.

3056
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:30,560
Yippee!

3057
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,560
Hold on.

3058
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,140
One second.

3059
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:40,100
Please don't spam!

3060
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:41,960
Please don't spam.

3061
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:42,480
Sorry.

3062
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,080
Don't spam, don't spam.

3063
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:46,600
Sake!

3064
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:50,620
Umm...

3065
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:57,710
Let's do the axe, duh.

3066
01:58:59,110 --> 01:58:59,770
There we

3067
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:05,460
go.

3068
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:06,800
I guess it really doesn't...

3069
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:12,100
I don't know why I'm auto-doing it when it really doesn't make a difference, but that's okay.

3070
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:15,020
Umm...

3071
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:18,500
Uh... rope!

3072
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:27,790
So far, so good.

3073
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:28,670
Right, guys?

3074
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,150
So far, so good.

3075
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:34,430
Moments before disaster.

3076
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:47,910
Okay, now it's just confusing if she has buckets of lava and I have buckets of lava.

3077
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:49,150
Right?

3078
01:59:51,310 --> 01:59:54,630
I'm gonna keep leveling up what I have.

3079
01:59:55,290 --> 02:00:03,230
And then once I kind of get those things better and more high up, then I shall...

3080
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:10,350
Then I shall focus on new items.

3081
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,090
Something missed.

3082
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:13,910
I don't know what it was.

3083
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:15,610
Great!

3084
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:25,390
It really makes me want pizza, but Japanese pizza is not good.

3085
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:32,350
Attacks have a 3% chance to hit holo coins out of target per hit.

3086
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:34,650
Oh, out of targets per hit.

3087
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:37,270
Chance and amount is increased for every 10 damage dealt.

3088
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:44,480
Maybe I get rid of... Swap rainbow!

3089
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,020
No!

3090
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:52,080
Maybe we get rid of the PCs.

3091
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:56,820
But the rainbow!

3092
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,460
Enhance the rainbow.

3093
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:12,120
Please stop it already.

3094
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:15,260
All the colors... It already has all the colors.

3095
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:17,240
We can't invent new colors.

3096
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:19,720
Yes, you can!

3097
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:31,020
Is it ult time?

3098
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:31,500
Yes.

3099
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,880
Oh, I don't have enough for my ult.

3100
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:34,160
No!

3101
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,000
Oh gosh.

3102
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:35,740
Please!

3103
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,780
Just a little bit more!

3104
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:50,300
Just a little bit more!

3105
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:52,180
And we can use it.

3106
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:54,020
Actually, I think... I think I'm okay.

3107
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,220
I think I'm okay.

3108
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,080
Not okay.

3109
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:58,300
Okay is a strong word.

3110
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:00,640
We are managing.

3111
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,240
We are managing.

3112
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:05,280
Right, everyone?

3113
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,460
We are managing.

3114
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:08,180
Look at all these guys.

3115
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:09,780
No saplings left behind.

3116
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:14,980
No saplings left behind!

3117
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:20,200
Water is aimable.

3118
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:20,740
Oh, it is!

3119
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:21,600
Okay.

3120
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:22,540
Good to know.

3121
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:23,760
PL book!

3122
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,660
So, the water is... Oh, I see it now.

3123
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,220
I see it.

3124
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:32,800
Oh.

3125
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:35,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3126
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:37,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3127
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,440
Oh, oh, oh.

3128
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:39,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3129
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:40,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3130
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:43,020
Kind of just like chilling in here.

3131
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:50,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3132
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:51,120
Bucket!

3133
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:59,340
So, like you have... What's it called?

3134
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:02,580
The anvil!

3135
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:05,320
Lava to seven?

3136
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:06,720
Save for lava to seven?

3137
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:07,660
Okay, we're gonna...

3138
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:09,960
Not yet, not yet.

3139
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:10,480
Okay, okay, okay.

3140
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:11,940
Oh my goodness.

3141
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:16,820
I'm trying to like chill in this area, but it's a little scary, you guys!

3142
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:21,560
Six!

3143
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,260
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3144
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:27,720
Not bad.

3145
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:28,140
There we go.

3146
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:29,580
Don't leave the tree!

3147
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:30,960
Don't leave the...

3148
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,740
Tree, don't leave me!

3149
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:36,960
Please survive.

3150
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:37,860
I'm trying.

3151
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:38,600
Oh my gosh.

3152
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,200
Oh my gosh.

3153
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:41,320
Okay, I have to leave the anvil, I think.

3154
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,040
Give me more food.

3155
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:44,940
Give me more food.

3156
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:46,900
I'm trying to grab health.

3157
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:48,000
Oh my god.

3158
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:50,420
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3159
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,120
Okay, okay, okay.

3160
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:58,120
Okay, okay.

3161
02:03:59,280 --> 02:03:59,680
Okay.

3162
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3163
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:03,640
I'm taking a lot of damage, you guys!

3164
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:09,850
Okay.

3165
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:12,370
Take that.

3166
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:14,530
Now we can collaborate because we maxed it.

3167
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:15,270
Okay.

3168
02:04:16,230 --> 02:04:17,930
So, which one should I...

3169
02:04:19,230 --> 02:04:20,030
Do the...

3170
02:04:21,690 --> 02:04:22,770
The lava and the axe?

3171
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:24,110
That's the one we didn't do before, right?

3172
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:30,470
Yeah?

3173
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:30,810
Okay.

3174
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:32,770
Ta-da!

3175
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:33,670
Whoa!

3176
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:35,590
Me cover!

3177
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,380
Take it.

3178
02:04:56,140 --> 02:04:56,730
Yep.

3179
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:58,630
Holy cow!

3180
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:00,190
Holy...

3181
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:01,750
Holy cow!

3182
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,030
The biggest pizza.

3183
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:11,200
Delicious.

3184
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:17,900
Oh my gosh.

3185
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:19,840
Okay, I'm trying to get out of here, actually.

3186
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,300
Thank you.

3187
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:22,000
Oh my god.

3188
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:24,380
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3189
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:28,700
Oh, I reached level 50!

3190
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:30,620
Let's max our...

3191
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:32,020
There's a stand to the right?

3192
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,360
Where at?

3193
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:34,480
Oh, gosh.

3194
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,000
Hold on.

3195
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:37,680
Oh, golden apple!

3196
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:44,760
Are these good?

3197
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:47,740
This is the one that I said I wanted to combine before, right?

3198
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:48,220
So...

3199
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,360
Endless waves of ice that slows targets.

3200
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:56,200
Okay...

3201
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:56,800
Oh my god!

3202
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:57,140
No!

3203
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:03,080
I just made it!

3204
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,040
I

3205
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:12,580
had this little bit left to be able to use my ult.

3206
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:18,160
We had only a little less than five minutes.

3207
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:21,740
No!

3208
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:26,860
Gotcha.

3209
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:27,080
Okay.

3210
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:30,100
Idol costume.

3211
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:33,340
Good try.

3212
02:06:33,740 --> 02:06:34,700
Yeah, that was a good try.

3213
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:37,860
Study glasses.

3214
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:39,880
Breastplate.

3215
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,420
Just a bandage.

3216
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:54,200
Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes.

3217
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:54,620
Okay?

3218
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:56,000
I'm gonna close my eyes.

3219
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:57,780
And I'm not even gonna know what I'm picking.

3220
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:00,500
I'm rotating.

3221
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:02,600
I don't even know what I'm picking.

3222
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,040
It's the ultimate gacha.

3223
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:04,700
Here!

3224
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:09,300
Oh, I have to open my eyes to buy it.

3225
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:12,240
Let's try!

3226
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:19,500
Suisei!

3227
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,000
Yippee!

3228
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:28,080
Sui-chan.

3229
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:29,440
You're so cute today.

3230
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:30,900
Yippee!

3231
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:37,700
Let's have fun!

3232
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:40,550
It was a good buy.

3233
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:40,870
What else?

3234
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:42,670
I still wanna try for Reinae.

3235
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,240
What?

3236
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:51,360
My first dupe!

3237
02:07:54,650 --> 02:07:56,110
My first dupe.

3238
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:58,350
Get onyed.

3239
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:00,170
Oh no!

3240
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:00,830
I got the tears.

3241
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:03,490
How many tears do you need?

3242
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,580
It's literally 2 thirds.

3243
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:12,360
How does this happen?

3244
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:12,560
It's literally 2 thirds.

3245
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:13,260
Seven?

3246
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:13,840
Okay.

3247
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:15,560
Seven.

3248
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,100
That's a... that's a Seinfeld joke.

3249
02:08:25,690 --> 02:08:26,050
Oh.

3250
02:08:26,570 --> 02:08:27,290
Oh, wait.

3251
02:08:27,650 --> 02:08:28,350
Oh, the tear?

3252
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:29,410
Oh, I see it now!

3253
02:08:30,330 --> 02:08:30,690
Okay.

3254
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:35,990
How did... wait, how did I... did I accidentally... how did I get to that?

3255
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:37,290
How did I get to that screen?

3256
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:42,510
Seinfeld Minto, your age is showing.

3257
02:08:42,650 --> 02:08:43,190
Okay, hold on.

3258
02:08:43,190 --> 02:08:49,990
To be fair, I watched all of Seinfeld like... it was like... only like a couple years ago.

3259
02:08:51,710 --> 02:08:54,250
Asuki is the best coin farmer in this game?

3260
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:56,570
You can get over 1 billion coins!

3261
02:08:57,050 --> 02:08:58,030
Is this true, chat?

3262
02:08:58,210 --> 02:08:58,610
Is this real?

3263
02:09:00,230 --> 02:09:01,790
Minto-chan wa kyou mo kawaii.

3264
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:03,170
Kawaii kunai!

3265
02:09:04,110 --> 02:09:05,030
Click on the picture.

3266
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:06,530
Oh, tears menu!

3267
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:07,230
Okay, cool, cool.

3268
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:09,170
Let's try for Asuki then.

3269
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:11,030
Here we go.

3270
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:18,070
Second dupe!

3271
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:24,520
Oh.

3272
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:27,520
Iris is also a coin farmer.

3273
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:28,120
You know what?

3274
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:31,920
I'm trying to also get Sana, so let's just keep going.

3275
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:33,660
Fails!

3276
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:38,500
Here we go.

3277
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:40,500
Baba!

3278
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:47,010
What is happening?

3279
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:54,340
Oops, all dupes.

3280
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:59,060
Okay, to be fair, we have 3 out of 6, so...

3281
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:09,480
There's still so many characters I have to unlock!

3282
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:16,420
I think though today... I know it's a bit of a shorter stream, but I think I'm gonna end it here because I started a bit later.

3283
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:17,560
I'm so sorry, guys!

3284
02:10:18,180 --> 02:10:19,580
But I think I'm gonna end it here.

3285
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:21,000
I wanna... oh gosh.

3286
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:24,660
I'm gonna play some off-stream probably.

3287
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:28,580
I say probably, but like... you know.

3288
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:38,080
I wanna test around with stuff and like see what kind of works for me and things that I like and everything, so...

3289
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:43,960
I'll come back and I'll... I'll come back and the whole menu will be complete at this point.

3290
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:48,060
But it's fun if you like big numbers.

3291
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:51,120
Yeah, I wanna try playing everybody and, you know...

3292
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:53,020
Um... like...

3293
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:54,840
How do I say?

3294
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:57,960
On my own time, because...

3295
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:03,880
You know, on stream, if I'm playing every... if I try everybody, that's like 20 minutes around.

3296
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:05,280
It'll just like take forever.

3297
02:11:05,860 --> 02:11:06,300
So...

3298
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:07,320
Try Princess, thank you!

3299
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:09,640
Um...

3300
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:10,540
But yeah!

3301
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:15,920
Turning off damage numbers is nice too.

3302
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:19,800
Luckily, this time I didn't feel like there was so much on screen.

3303
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:21,100
Luckily, this time I didn't feel like there was so much on screen.

3304
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,940
A little bit more manageable, because I turned down the opacity, but...

3305
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:26,780
Save Mumei for stream.

3306
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:28,800
Okay.

3307
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:29,600
Sure, sure.

3308
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:30,680
Will I play more of this on stream?

3309
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:30,960
Yeah!

3310
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:31,760
I will.

3311
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:33,000
So, so, so.

3312
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:34,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3313
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:35,740
Um...

3314
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:38,500
But today, just because I started a bit later...

3315
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:40,860
And I have some other things I need to work on.

3316
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:44,240
So I'm going to head out and do that.

3317
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:47,060
I'm actually not going outside today.

3318
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,260
I'm like staying holed up in my hotel room.

3319
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:54,520
Turning off damage numbers can also help with performance.

3320
02:11:54,820 --> 02:11:54,980
Oh!

3321
02:11:55,860 --> 02:11:56,760
What is...

3322
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:59,140
I'm curious for those who do...

3323
02:11:59,140 --> 02:11:59,720
Not the...

3324
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:00,300
What's it called?

3325
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,600
Hold on, I'm just going to...

3326
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:03,880
No, for the endless mode!

3327
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:06,720
What is your best time?

3328
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:08,340
Where's the leaderboards actually?

3329
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,400
Wait.

3330
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:18,780
How do I change it?

3331
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:24,560
45 minutes?

3332
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,280
40 minutes?

3333
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:25,860
Wow.

3334
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:26,760
50 minutes?

3335
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:29,160
Click stage 1.

3336
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:30,080
Wait...

3337
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:33,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

3338
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:39,820
BibuXX underscore biburocks underscore xx.

3339
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,300
I can't tell if this is...

3340
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:46,260
This has to be endless, right?

3341
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:46,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3342
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:49,280
49 minutes?

3343
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:52,700
So edgy.

3344
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:53,740
If it's Bibu, then...

3345
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:56,220
40 minutes?

3346
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:57,800
42 minutes?

3347
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:04,520
All of you saying, I'm not... Oh wait, this is Amelia Watson.

3348
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,620
Hold on, maybe I should try...

3349
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:09,740
I was gonna say, you guys out here with like...

3350
02:13:09,740 --> 02:13:11,600
You're like, I've done 45 minutes.

3351
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:12,680
Where are you then?

3352
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,860
Where are you on the leaderboard?

3353
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:16,960
What's your...

3354
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:22,660
What's your main?

3355
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:24,620
And don't tell me it's a character.

3356
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:27,360
And don't tell me it's a person that I haven't unlocked.

3357
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:28,620
Because that's just cheating.

3358
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:31,380
50 minutes?

3359
02:13:31,540 --> 02:13:31,700
Okay.

3360
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:34,000
50 minutes here too.

3361
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:43,380
You wouldn't know my man.

3362
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:44,960
Iris?

3363
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:46,680
No, I don't have Iris!

3364
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:51,670
What about Fauna?

3365
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:52,090
Let's see.

3366
02:13:52,850 --> 02:13:53,890
51 minutes!

3367
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:56,510
Player!

3368
02:13:57,410 --> 02:13:58,930
This Anno person is everywhere.

3369
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:01,110
They're a big fan.

3370
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:07,910
36, 30...

3371
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:10,310
Oh, I was looking at time.

3372
02:14:10,630 --> 02:14:11,890
Wait, hold on, I wanna see...

3373
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:17,350
Oh, I was gonna say, where am I?

3374
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:20,630
I'm gonna do endless.

3375
02:14:20,930 --> 02:14:21,770
Maybe, should I do...

3376
02:14:21,770 --> 02:14:22,510
Wait, you guys...

3377
02:14:22,510 --> 02:14:24,190
Should we do endless and see how...

3378
02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:25,670
193!

3379
02:14:26,330 --> 02:14:28,030
I don't think we're gonna get very far.

3380
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:34,060
Oh...

3381
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:39,940
I wanna get on the daily ranking.

3382
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:46,660
Stage 1.

3383
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:47,560
Wait, stage 1.

3384
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:48,740
Oh, this is daily.

3385
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:50,220
No!

3386
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:52,000
I don't think I'll get in the...

3387
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,280
I realize it's not time at score.

3388
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:55,380
Which makes more sense.

3389
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:57,460
I don't think I'll get...

3390
02:14:57,460 --> 02:14:59,760
But I could get... I could do stage 2, you guys.

3391
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:00,400
And get in the...

3392
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,740
We'll get in the ranking because...

3393
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:05,420
I might be 4th, but you know...

3394
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:06,800
I'll be... You know what?

3395
02:15:06,820 --> 02:15:07,200
Let's just...

3396
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:07,720
Let's go do it.

3397
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:08,000
Okay.

3398
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:09,480
Fauna...

3399
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:10,960
Endless mode...

3400
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:11,760
Stage 2.

3401
02:15:11,980 --> 02:15:13,680
It doesn't matter how long I last.

3402
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:14,900
It doesn't matter because...

3403
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,600
I'll be up there anyway.

3404
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:18,200
Don't play it!

3405
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:20,340
You guys, if you are playing it right now...

3406
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:21,600
Please...

3407
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,640
Let me have this.

3408
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:23,640
Let me...

3409
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:24,860
Let me have just this, okay?

3410
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:28,200
Please, let me just have this!

3411
02:15:28,300 --> 02:15:28,500
Please!

3412
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:30,040
Just for...

3413
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:31,020
Just for one game.

3414
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:31,820
Just for like...

3415
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:33,700
Let me screenshot it and then...

3416
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:34,520
And then...

3417
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:38,120
And then...

3418
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:39,460
And then...

3419
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:39,700
And then...

3420
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:39,980
It's fine.

3421
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:40,760
You can beat me.

3422
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:41,260
It's whatever.

3423
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:42,880
But let me have it just for a second, okay?

3424
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:44,420
Let me have it for just a second!

3425
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:48,780
Let me have it for just a second.

3426
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:50,740
Don't snipe!

3427
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:51,560
Don't snipe, please!

3428
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:52,860
Please!

3429
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:00,060
No!

3430
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:01,240
Don't dunk on me!

3431
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:02,780
Oh, I have to pay attention.

3432
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:04,420
You guys are making me lose control!

3433
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:06,160
Please!

3434
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:06,840
Oh my gosh.

3435
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:08,460
Please!

3436
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:09,600
Don't make me...

3437
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:11,040
Please, guys.

3438
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:11,400
Please.

3439
02:16:11,660 --> 02:16:12,300
Oh my gosh.

3440
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:13,160
We're a little trapped here.

3441
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:16,060
This is fine.

3442
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:17,200
This is fine.

3443
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:18,500
This is...

3444
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:19,120
This is fine.

3445
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:24,020
They just...

3446
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:25,860
Which...

3447
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:26,740
Which version is this?

3448
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:30,580
This is the most updated because I downloaded it yesterday onto my laptop.

3449
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:32,760
Got to get the screenshot.

3450
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:33,180
Yes!

3451
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:33,600
Exactly!

3452
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:34,140
Okay.

3453
02:16:39,150 --> 02:16:39,630
Okay.

3454
02:16:39,630 --> 02:16:39,950
Okay.

3455
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:41,750
Okay.

3456
02:16:42,390 --> 02:16:42,790
Okay.

3457
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:47,370
If I die now, I'll probably get fourth.

3458
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:55,200
What's my rank?

3459
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:55,920
Come on.

3460
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,620
Rank me.

3461
02:16:58,340 --> 02:16:58,740
Okay.

3462
02:16:59,120 --> 02:16:59,520
Okay.

3463
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:02,280
I think my score is 195.

3464
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:03,680
No way.

3465
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:04,160
Okay.

3466
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:04,500
Hold on.

3467
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:05,240
We have to see it.

3468
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:06,080
We have to see it fast!

3469
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:43,700
Fourth spooky number!

3470
02:17:47,010 --> 02:17:47,410
Okay.

3471
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:48,290
That was it.

3472
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:49,490
That was the grand finale.

3473
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:52,330
Scream.

3474
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:52,550
Scream shot.

3475
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:52,810
Yeah.

3476
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:54,330
Let me take that screenshot real quick.

3477
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:55,390
Thank you.

3478
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:55,650
Thank you.

3479
02:17:56,070 --> 02:17:56,090
Kiss.

3480
02:17:57,230 --> 02:17:57,670
Kiss.

3481
02:17:59,550 --> 02:17:59,990
Perfect.

3482
02:18:00,450 --> 02:18:01,050
I got it.

3483
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:03,690
No.

3484
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:04,730
Thank you.

3485
02:18:05,050 --> 02:18:05,430
Just...

3486
02:18:05,430 --> 02:18:06,870
Thank you.

3487
02:18:07,970 --> 02:18:15,530
I just wanted to say, as someone that was never into idols before getting to VTubers, having the chance to see you in concert and shout along to the Hamtaro theme was a dream come true.

3488
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:16,970
Miss Kitsune, I love you.

3489
02:18:18,830 --> 02:18:19,710
So happy.

3490
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:21,230
Thank you.

3491
02:18:22,130 --> 02:18:22,990
Heretic, thank you.

3492
02:18:23,090 --> 02:18:23,530
Hi Mint.

3493
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:24,030
I love you.

3494
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:24,650
Will you marry me?

3495
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:25,310
Platonically.

3496
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:31,090
What benefits can we get out of this platonic marriage?

3497
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:33,570
I'm the worldwide...

3498
02:18:33,570 --> 02:18:33,970
I'm sorry.

3499
02:18:34,070 --> 02:18:34,970
I'm the world wife...

3500
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:36,690
World wife Mintoa.

3501
02:18:38,310 --> 02:18:38,890
I think.

3502
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:42,630
Divorce.

3503
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:48,830
I also did four VTuber concerts in three days and felt like my arms are going to fall off.

3504
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:49,870
Holy cow.

3505
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:55,240
Yeah, platonically of course.

3506
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,340
Platonically, you guys.

3507
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:00,720
Anyway, this is so fun.

3508
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:05,920
Thanks for all the tips helping me out with some of the items and helping me out when I had questions.

3509
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:08,500
I really always appreciate that when you guys help me.

3510
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:10,080
And this is a lot of fun.

3511
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,840
Congrats on getting top four in the leaderboards.

3512
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:16,360
First, I made it in...

3513
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:18,640
Me and Doki had that...

3514
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:20,180
Had that hotel sick and tired.

3515
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:23,140
We had that 666 run on speed runs.

3516
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:24,560
We had that speed run.

3517
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:26,340
That made what?

3518
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:27,680
Like top two.

3519
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:28,960
Right?

3520
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:29,880
And now...

3521
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:31,100
Now this.

3522
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:35,200
You guys, I'm on my way to the top, baby.

3523
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:39,920
I'm on my way to the top.

3524
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:42,700
We're killing it.

3525
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:45,980
Yeah.

3526
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:47,160
Top three.

3527
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:47,660
Top three.

3528
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:49,680
Thanks for the streams.

3529
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:50,160
Take care.

3530
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:15,420
I hope you guys have a great day or have a great night, whatever time it is for you.

3531
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:19,520
And, you know, I'm sorry again that the times have been a little...

3532
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:20,160
I'm sorry.

3533
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:22,340
Especially for my normal times.

3534
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:26,080
So if you stayed up, thank you so much.

3535
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:26,840
I'm so sorry.

3536
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:28,000
Please get some sleep.

3537
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:29,580
And yeah.

3538
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:32,160
Have a great night.

3539
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:33,060
Have a great day.

3540
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:40,960
And I will see you guys not tomorrow because I will be at an event for the next two days.

3541
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:42,260
I think I'm good.

3542
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:43,560
I think the typhoon...

3543
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:46,440
I think I'm good.

3544
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:50,100
Hopefully the typhoon doesn't ruin my plans.

3545
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:50,800
Let's go!

3546
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:54,000
Our tori too thank you guys.

3547
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:56,220
Bye bye.

3548
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:57,540
See you.

3549
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:58,480
Bye bye.

3550
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:00,500
I go.

3551
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:00,640
Bye bye.

3552
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:30,050
Oh my God.

3553
02:21:30,070 --> 02:21:31,410
You guys Maserata tell you.

3554
02:21:31,470 --> 02:21:36,570
So when I saw Mataro yesterday, she gave me a kinder egg, and I'm only...

3555
02:21:36,570 --> 02:21:40,070
I've never had a kinder egg that had the little toy inside.

3556
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:42,890
And I got the toy inside.

3557
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:43,530
But I got nothing.

3558
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:49,230
And I was eating the egg and I was like, oh yeah, let me open up my toy and I opened it.

3559
02:21:49,350 --> 02:21:51,930
You guys, it was a lizard!

3560
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:55,550
I hear him.

3561
02:21:59,370 --> 02:22:00,730
His tail shakes!

3562
02:22:02,190 --> 02:22:05,330
I was so... I opened it up and I audibly went... I was like...

3563
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:08,630
It was right before stream.

3564
02:22:08,670 --> 02:22:10,710
I audibly went like, no way!

3565
02:22:10,710 --> 02:22:10,990
Yay!

3566
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:16,610
He's so cute.

3567
02:22:16,710 --> 02:22:22,370
He's been my little buddy on my desk ever since I got him like five minutes ago.

3568
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:26,150
Okay, bye-bye.
