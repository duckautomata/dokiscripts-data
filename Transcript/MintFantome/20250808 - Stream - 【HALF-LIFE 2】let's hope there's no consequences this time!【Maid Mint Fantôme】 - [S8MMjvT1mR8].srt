1
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,130
Beep beep.

2
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,010
Beep beep.

3
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,770
Beep beep beep beep.

4
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:18,690
Welcome back to Half-Life.

5
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,610
Except... two!

6
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,890
The second one!

7
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,870
Yippee!

8
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,510
Beep beep.

9
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,310
Oh my gosh, the sounds of the radios are triggering me a little bit.

10
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,770
I'm like, who's there?

11
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,290
Who's around the corner?

12
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,390
What?

13
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,750
Beep beep.

14
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,190
Beep beep.

15
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,210
Yeah, I'm on dark mode today because it's a little... I don't know.

16
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,190
I was like, this is my gear.

17
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,630
This is my gear!

18
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,530
You love the radio?

19
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,210
It doesn't freak you out?

20
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,630
It doesn't make you be like...

21
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,390
Ugh!

22
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,650
Ugh!

23
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,550
Somebody's here!

24
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,470
No, I'm with the science team.

25
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,930
Peek Phantom playing Peek Fiction.

26
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,370
This is fiction?

27
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:13,990
I'm Jay.

28
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,930
Thank you so much for the fun.

29
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,290
I've gifted.

30
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,030
Thank you!

31
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,070
Yesterday's stream was the perfect birthday present!

32
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,150
Thank you for making me laugh so hard and for mowing the pond.

33
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,110
Hey.

34
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,630
I have a special gift.

35
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,950
Happy birthday!

36
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,150
Glad I could make you laugh.

37
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,650
Yeah.

38
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,410
One of my favorite games of all time.

39
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,130
Really?

40
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,830
Look at that guy walking around.

41
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,070
What is that mask on that he's got?

42
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,350
Alright.

43
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,410
Where are we?

44
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,250
Dark Minky, my beloved.

45
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,230
It's been a minute, right?

46
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,090
Dark Minky of the Half-Life, what is your wisdom?

47
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:00,890
Um...

48
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,590
Um...

49
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,470
Don't shoot!

50
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,210
I'm with the science team!

51
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,090
Is that a crowbar in your pants?

52
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,370
Or are you happy to see me?

53
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,650
It's in my hands.

54
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,830
Yesterday was one of the greatest bits of...

55
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,410
I've ever seen for a regular non-event stream.

56
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,810
Here's 25 credits worth...

57
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,210
Oh, sorry.

58
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,550
No.

59
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,950
Here's 100 credits worth of quarters.

60
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,430
Um...

61
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:30,970
Thank you!

62
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,250
I just... I was just being goofy.

63
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,230
If you guys don't know, you can watch the...

64
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,330
my...

65
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,550
Jurassic Park Arcade!

66
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,710
Stream Key!

67
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,030
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

68
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,730
Thank you!

69
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,560
Did you still sell lemonade?

70
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,000
I had just had the one cup left.

71
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,260
I... you know...

72
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,140
I made enough for one.

73
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,500
This most special...

74
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,580
crafted with care...

75
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,560
cup of lemonade...

76
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,660
you'd ever, ever, ever come across!

77
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,540
Half-Life 2, where was full life one?

78
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,560
Yeah!

79
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,740
Would this be...

80
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,480
the other...

81
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,760
the other...

82
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,340
part...

83
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,280
other...

84
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,980
half...

85
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,960
wait...

86
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,640
ha...

87
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,300
Now this...

88
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,940
pla...

89
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,820
this...

90
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,940
plus...

91
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,720
Half-Life 1...

92
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Half-Life 2...

93
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,780
equals...

94
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,920
full life...

95
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,460
1...

96
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,100
We're not choosing...

97
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,120
...

98
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
with that!

99
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,480
Jesus 3...

100
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,960
as for now.

101
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,860
...

102
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,080
Yes!

103
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,200
Thank you guys so much!

104
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,680
Free-換 foot licker, thank you for the...

105
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,900
This is the second other gift that I saw before.

106
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,680
Thank you!

107
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,380
Thank you, thank you!

108
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,820
Thank you guys for all the...

109
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,460
Who knows, and my boy ships, thank you.

110
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,840
Miss Mel-chan, thank you for the pocket today, thank you.

111
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,560
Yeah, I'm excited to play this, so...

112
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,300
I'm excited.

113
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,120
It's an early stream for me, quite early.

114
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,880
So maybe some of you guys are at work.

115
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:18,140
And if you are, I'm here to whisper sweet nothings into your ears so you can get through the work day.

116
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,640
But it's also Friday!

117
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,780
Yippee!

118
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:30,880
It's Friday, and if you're not at work, and you're just chilling, hanging out with me, maybe you got off work already, because it's later, eww...

119
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,060
Dan, otu!

120
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,340
Otu, otu!

121
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,520
And...

122
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,200
Yeah!

123
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,360
I just decided, I was like, I want to try doing more midday streams, and I...

124
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,300
For me, at least.

125
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,240
And so, a little bit...

126
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,140
At least have some...

127
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,680
A few more EU-friendly streams in my...

128
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,600
In my lineup!

129
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,880
Hot dog, indeed!

130
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,920
Finally managed to catch you live, so it's good to see you!

131
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,240
Thank you, Sargei!

132
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Thank you, thank you.

133
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,440
Ear whispers, let's go!

134
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm summoning a demon?

135
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,360
Sending my Han's money to Minto instead.

136
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,360
Fuzzy, I hate to break it to you, but what...

137
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,840
Five bucks in a gacha game is like pennies.

138
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,220
How much is a ten-pole in Uma?

139
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,460
Hi, Minto!

140
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,000
Hi!

141
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,530
Twenty...

142
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,170
Twenty?

143
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,750
Fourteen on sale.

144
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,570
Twenty bucks.

145
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,150
Twenty...

146
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,850
Twenty-five.

147
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,970
Yes!

148
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,410
I'm at work right now.

149
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,490
And have you projected on the break room TV?

150
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,690
I will bring culture to my workplace.

151
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,710
I will be work-friendly then!

152
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,330
I will attempt.

153
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,770
There will be an attempt.

154
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,730
Half-Life plus Half-Life 2 equals Half-Life Alex.

155
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,350
So she's three years old!

156
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,630
Three years old!

157
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,470
Unemployed gang, rise up!

158
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,350
Don't send me a super chat then!

159
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,790
Save your money!

160
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,510
EU time slot for a game set in mythical land known as Central Europe.

161
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,550
Is this?

162
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,670
Are we actually?

163
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,610
Well, I guess we should get started then, huh?

164
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,270
I guess we should get started.

165
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,010
I'm confused though.

166
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,930
I'm obviously...

167
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,270
I'm guessing I just click Half-Life 2.

168
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,130
And that...

169
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,490
It'll play Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and 2.

170
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:11,990
Nope.

171
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,210
Yes?

172
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:14,670
Okay.

173
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,750
The game is about Europe, then it's perfect for EU time, right?

174
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,790
So, last time...

175
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,150
Half-Life 1 ended.

176
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,530
Um...

177
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,470
The scary...

178
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,870
The scary skibbity man came to us and he said, I like what you're doing, kid.

179
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,410
I wanna hire you.

180
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,310
And we went to the...

181
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,350
What was it called?

182
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,710
Um...

183
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,530
The ZEN!

184
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,230
Oh, the dimension between realms.

185
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:21,090
Yeah, we went there, and we shot many monsters, and we killed a big baby.

186
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,870
Yeah, we did that.

187
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,630
And, yeah, then Mr. Skibbity came to us and he said, I like your riz.

188
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,510
I like your riz.

189
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,230
I want to hire you.

190
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:41,750
And, and we could either say, no way, Jose, and be teleported to a place where you just die.

191
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:50,010
Or you could, um, you could, uh, say yes and then end the game.

192
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,010
So that's what we did.

193
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,270
Greetings from Otaku-thon.

194
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,990
Missing you.

195
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,730
Any messages you want to pass to Matara and Laimu?

196
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,510
Oh, uh, Batara, say, stinky, stinky mama.

197
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,950
And Laimu, say, I love Laimu.

198
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,570
Oh, speaking of Laimu, I got to talk about her a lot.

199
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:21,730
Because, um, uh, uh, at the Metal Gear thing, I also got to meet Vinnie Vinesauce.

200
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,030
He was there.

201
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,060
And, uh, I got to be like, I love Laimu.

202
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,820
I feel like any time I talked to her, I was like, so Laimu?

203
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,700
Laimu?

204
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,980
I love her.

205
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,300
So, yeah, I really like Laimu.

206
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,110
Yeah, I got to meet that guy.

207
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,990
Um, it was very nice.

208
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,770
Okay.

209
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,850
Okay, Half-Life 2.

210
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,430
I also got to tell him that I like his...

211
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,330
His, like, glitch streams.

212
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,990
His glitch playthroughs of...

213
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,990
Metal Gear.

214
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,190
No.

215
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,690
Okay.

216
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,810
Achievements.

217
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,530
New game.

218
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,150
Are these spoilers?

219
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,730
Enable commentary.

220
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,330
What?

221
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,110
Wait, will the devs talk to me?

222
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,510
That's kind of crazy.

223
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,310
Diaperchief.

224
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,070
Oh my gosh, I forgot to tell him that.

225
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,260
It's great.

226
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,700
Enable yap mode.

227
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,620
Maybe, maybe if I ever play...

228
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,940
But this is my first time playing, so I don't want yap mode.

229
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,280
They could spoil.

230
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,580
And then I'll be like, oh no.

231
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,340
Oh, no.

232
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,580
Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman.

233
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,300
Rise and shine.

234
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,480
Oh, wow.

235
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,920
Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job.

236
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,700
I think you need some more sleep.

237
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,220
No one is more deserving of a rest.

238
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,940
And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste.

239
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,420
Until...

240
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,180
Until...

241
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,680
Well...

242
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,980
Let's just say your hour has come again.

243
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,600
Yes.

244
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,480
The right man in the wrong place...

245
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,800
Dramatic pause.

246
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,740
Can make all the difference in the world.

247
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,040
Difference.

248
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:43,880
Difference.

249
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,260
So wake up, Mr. Freeman.

250
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,100
Wake up and smell the ashes.

251
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,500
The ashes?

252
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,960
Hello, sir.

253
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,600
Good morning.

254
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,140
I didn't see you get on.

255
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,020
I've been here the whole time.

256
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,520
This is my third transfer this year.

257
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,260
Wow, it already looks so good.

258
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,380
Oh, like it already...

259
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,120
Hello.

260
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,660
No matter how many times I've been relocated...

261
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,940
I'm getting used to it.

262
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,760
End of the line.

263
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,760
End of the line.

264
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,220
Oh, you're pushing me out the door.

265
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,000
Okay, you really want me to get to work up.

266
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,380
It looks so good.

267
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,480
You have chosen...

268
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,940
Or been chosen...

269
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,220
To relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.

270
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,920
I feel like I'm at the Hunger Games.

271
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:52,600
So much in City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here in the Citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors.

272
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,260
I've been proud to call City 17 my home.

273
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:06,180
And so, whether you are here to stay or passing through on your way to parts unknown, Welcome to City 17.

274
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,720
Chill.

275
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
It's safer here.

276
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,580
Yeah, it's safer here.

277
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,380
What is that?

278
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,500
What the?

279
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,200
I like the credits.

280
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,060
Very cinematic.

281
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,140
It was already cinematic in the first game.

282
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,880
And it's now even so much more cinematic.

283
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,440
Are you gonna...

284
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Are you gonna be nice to that guy?

285
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,380
He's just...

286
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,500
He's just sweeping.

287
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,740
You're sweeping everything into the...

288
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,420
Into the corner.

289
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,340
Is that our booty shot, man?

290
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,820
Booty shot.

291
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,860
Booty shot.

292
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,580
You have chosen...

293
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,040
Or been chosen...

294
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,320
To relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.

295
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,980
I'm just looking around.

296
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,400
I'm taking it all in.

297
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,820
Booty shot.

298
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,820
Booty shot.

299
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,760
It is!

300
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,460
Zerker, thank you so much for the tech gift.

301
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,120
Thank you!

302
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,820
I don't know.

303
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,480
Where are the...

304
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,200
I was just thinking.

305
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,580
Thank you.

306
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,840
I was thinking about the subtitles.

307
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,200
Audio, maybe?

308
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,180
Oh, captions.

309
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,540
Here we go.

310
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,140
Closed captions, I guess.

311
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,820
I've been proud to call City 17 my home.

312
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,400
And so, whether you are here to stay or...

313
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,740
Passing through on your way to...

314
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,560
Parts Unknown.

315
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,320
Hello?

316
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,080
Welcome.

317
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,720
To City 17.

318
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,780
Did that not work?

319
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,040
I thought that would do everything.

320
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,760
Dialogue only.

321
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,580
Looking forward to this Half-Life 2 rocks.

322
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,680
Thank you!

323
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,500
I vaguely recall you said you wanted to lick up speedruns...

324
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,600
After you finished Half-Life 1.

325
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:45,860
Did you?

326
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,960
I didn't actually!

327
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,520
Maybe I will, because I have time today.

328
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,640
Ah, here we go.

329
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,060
Gotth Ghostbade Mint whispering sweet nothing into my ears.

330
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,360
Blush blush.

331
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Also petition to release the sexy button.

332
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,000
Blush is harder.

333
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,840
No!

334
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,700
I actually looked it up.

335
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,300
First warning.

336
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,020
Live away.

337
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,640
But this stuff...

338
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,580
It's all I have left.

339
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:09,920
Good luck.

340
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,520
Move it.

341
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,680
All right, I'm moving.

342
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,000
Jeez.

343
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,620
No, let it take a stop.

344
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,420
Hey, you don't...

345
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,880
I...

346
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm big news here.

347
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,880
Oh my gosh!

348
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,480
Ouch!

349
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,040
Okay.

350
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,820
Welcome to City 17.

351
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,320
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

352
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,920
You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.

353
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,320
I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here.

354
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,260
Can I knock over everything?

355
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,280
In the citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors.

356
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,880
I got your stuff, bro.

357
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,200
Oh.

358
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,940
I've got to call City 17 my home.

359
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,780
I got it for you.

360
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,940
Are you the only ones on that train?

361
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,620
And so, whether you are here to stay or passing...

362
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,700
What's the girl from the, from my thumbnail?

363
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,880
Welcome to City 17.

364
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,500
Hello.

365
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,940
It's safer here.

366
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,520
Overwatch stopped our train in the woods and took my husband for questioning.

367
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,280
Eat a grab.

368
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,780
They said he'd be on the next train.

369
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,420
I'm not sure when that was.

370
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,000
They're, they're being nice though, letting me wait for him.

371
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,680
Wait, so eat a grab?

372
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,240
Oh!

373
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,040
Wait, what was this?

374
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,160
A boot.

375
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,820
Is there a way I can throw?

376
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,080
You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.

377
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Oops, sorry.

378
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,540
I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here.

379
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,900
Even the citadel so farfully provided by our...

380
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,540
Oh no.

381
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:50,940
Oh!

382
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,000
I've been proud to call City 17 my home.

383
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,900
She shoots!

384
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,060
And so, whether you are here to stay or passing the two on your way to...

385
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,740
She scores!

386
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,900
Cool!

387
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,360
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

388
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,640
Yes!

389
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,480
The vending machines still work!

390
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,020
Oh.

391
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,360
Well, they did.

392
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,580
No more!

393
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,700
No more!

394
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,040
I just...

395
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,900
I just broke a bottle over her head.

396
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,220
Change.

397
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,820
Someone's talking.

398
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,020
Oh my god, this guy is just never ending talking.

399
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
I get it.

400
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm in the city.

401
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm in the city.

402
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm in the city.

403
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm really trying to up that affection level.

404
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,460
Yeah.

405
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Hat dog indeed.

406
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,660
What can I say?

407
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,060
I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, you know, I like you.

408
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
I tease you a little by throwing things at your head.

409
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh my god, everybody's talking.

410
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,340
The city is based on multiple different settings in Eastern and Central Europe.

411
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,880
Viktor Antonov, the art director, grew up in Sofia.

412
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,840
I've used it for the layout, but a bunch of the architectures...

413
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,940
Literally, literally, just various countries as government buildings.

414
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,960
Oh, no way!

415
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,020
I am scared to go in there, are you?

416
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
That guy, he's like, meh.

417
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,680
Hehehehehe.

418
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,820
Okay.

419
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,800
I'll go.

420
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,220
Where are you taking me?

421
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,220
On me?

422
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:32,720
Where?

423
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,980
Where are you taking me?

424
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,380
Okay.

425
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,600
Why are you guys just standing around?

426
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,320
Do you enjoy watching me behind bars?

427
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,220
Welcome.

428
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,080
Welcome to City 17.

429
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,740
You have chosen or been chosen to relocate to one of our finest lands.

430
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,020
Remaining urban centers.

431
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,040
I thought...

432
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,140
Ah!

433
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,620
Ah!

434
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,540
What did I do?

435
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,920
What did I...

436
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,060
What did I do?

437
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,860
What did I do?

438
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,820
Oh my god, is it the back?

439
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,880
Okay.

440
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm a thief!

441
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,020
And so, whether you are here to...

442
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,020
This must be a mistake.

443
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,480
I got a standard relocation coupon just like everybody else.

444
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,040
I'm being nosy.

445
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,760
Hello?

446
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:34,940
Oh.

447
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,800
Now I'm good.

448
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,460
Now I'm good.

449
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,260
Now I'm good.

450
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,000
You!

451
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,980
I've been...

452
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,780
I haven't moved.

453
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,340
I'm gonna need me some privacy for this.

454
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,820
About that beer I owed ya.

455
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
It's me, Gordon.

456
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,160
Barney from Black Mesa.

457
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:55,960
Barney!

458
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,620
Sorry for the scare.

459
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,380
I had to put on a show for the cameras.

460
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,820
Oh my god.

461
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,220
Barney!

462
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,660
Barney!

463
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,000
Barney!

464
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,180
Barney!

465
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,440
They'll get suspicious.

466
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm way behind on my beating quota.

467
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,860
Yes, Barney.

468
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,740
What is it?

469
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm in the middle of a critical test.

470
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,020
Everybody's here!

471
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:12,720
Sorry doc, but...

472
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,640
Look who's here.

473
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,140
It's me!

474
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,200
Scott!

475
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,200
Gordon Freeman!

476
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
I didn't expect more warning.

477
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,760
Yeah, you and me both, Doc.

478
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,780
He was about to board the Express to Nova Prospect.

479
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,280
Well, Barney, what do you intend?

480
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,020
I'm thinking, I'm thinking!

481
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,860
Alex is around here somewhere.

482
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,460
She would have a better idea of getting here.

483
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,220
Well, as long as he stays away from checkpoints, we should be okay.

484
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,880
Listen, I gotta go, Doc.

485
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,540
We're taking enough chances as it is.

486
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
Very well.

487
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,100
Very well.

488
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,940
And, uh...

489
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,160
Gordon?

490
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,960
Good to see you.

491
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,380
Okay, Gordon.

492
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:46,800
Yep.

493
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,440
You're gonna have to make your own way to Dr. Kleiner's lab.

494
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:49,800
Alright.

495
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,380
Oh.

496
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,180
Oh, man!

497
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,380
That's what I was afraid of!

498
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,240
Get in here, Gordon!

499
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,660
Before you blow my cover!

500
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:54,980
Okay!

501
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,600
I'm in!

502
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:55,940
I'm in!

503
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,460
Pile up some stuff to get through that window, and keep going until you're in the plaza!

504
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,160
I'll meet up with you later!

505
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,700
I love you, Barney!

506
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,660
Okay, we're gonna pile up stuff.

507
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:08,900
Alright.

508
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,600
I can just use the stairs.

509
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,460
I can just use...

510
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,620
Okay.

511
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,020
The ladder.

512
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,000
That's what I meant to say.

513
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,420
Alright.

514
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,960
There we go.

515
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,440
Awesome.

516
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,480
Awesome!

517
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,660
Okay, here I go.

518
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,400
Can I make this fall?

519
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,560
Or...

520
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,320
I sure hope I can.

521
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,920
Oh!

522
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,780
Thank you for the breath!

523
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,360
Hello!

524
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,300
Hi, everybody!

525
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,880
Thank you, Skye.

526
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,380
Hello, hello.

527
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,020
Oh, I just started Half-Life 2.

528
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,000
So...

529
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,310
I sure hope nobody heard that.

530
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,830
I'm gonna take this for self-defense.

531
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,530
Thank you for the gift, you guys.

532
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,010
Thank you!

533
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,410
Sorry.

534
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,530
I feel like this game is so hard to reach out while I go through it.

535
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:05,810
Oh.

536
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,070
Push the door.

537
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,230
It is open.

538
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,830
Oh, it opens the other way.

539
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,190
Okay.

540
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,790
Just kidding.

541
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,130
Oh.

542
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:15,550
Let's

543
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,280
go get my cinder block.

544
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,040
Mimi!

545
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,780
Hi.

546
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,330
Oh, shoot.

547
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,450
Okay, it's heavy.

548
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,250
Um...

549
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,200
At least he doesn't notice.

550
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,160
Pick up that can.

551
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,860
Pick up that can.

552
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,360
Oh, this?

553
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,560
Immotality.

554
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,160
Is...

555
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,840
In our own reach.

556
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,380
Now, this...

557
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,700
Simplified.

558
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,640
Has far-reaching implications.

559
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,500
Ah!

560
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,260
Wait!

561
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,100
No, I'm sorry.

562
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm sorry.

563
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,100
I didn't mean to...

564
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,350
Everyone does that though, right?

565
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,570
I got the...

566
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,670
I got an achievement.

567
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,930
Everybody does that.

568
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,710
Probably.

569
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,330
Oh.

570
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,870
He took that like a champ.

571
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,770
This guy just is always yappin'.

572
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,370
Pick up that can.

573
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,120
Okay.

574
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,040
Wait, where is the can?

575
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,100
Oh, man.

576
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,800
Oh!

577
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,500
Did he do that?

578
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,300
I'll teach you to recycle.

579
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
It's a rickshot!

580
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,940
Am I the coolest of all time?

581
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,960
I'm the coat!

582
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,320
Hello.

583
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,740
Oh, gosh.

584
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,640
Don't you know who I am?

585
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm the hero!

586
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,960
Me and my boyfriend are watching the stream together today since he loves Half-Life and I love Minto!

587
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,440
Hoping to convert him and make two wisps out of one!

588
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,460
Ooh la la!

589
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,540
Thanks, Zombie!

590
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,820
Have fun!

591
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,360
Hello?

592
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,260
What?

593
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,620
What?

594
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,100
We should thank our benefactors for giving us respite from this overpowering force.

595
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,780
They have thrown a switch and exorcised our demons in a single stroke.

596
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,120
They have erased the horny?

597
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,980
We never could have summoned to overcome this compulsion.

598
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,380
What?

599
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,980
They have given us pulse.

600
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,860
They have turned our eyes toward the sky.

601
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,480
Oh!

602
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,720
Wait, what the heck is this thing?

603
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,280
What are you- Look at that posture.

604
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,080
Shikure Ui pose.

605
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,120
Hello?

606
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,820
The line starts at the end.

607
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,740
Oh, okay, sorry.

608
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,090
Line starts at the end.

609
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,650
Can I get my one phone call?

610
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,090
Ho!

611
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,670
Oops.

612
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,870
I think it's broken.

613
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,390
Actually.

614
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:18,990
Wolf?

615
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,110
Can I talk?

616
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:20,470
Oh!

617
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:20,970
Okay.

618
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,470
All right.

619
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,730
None of them want to talk to me.

620
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,470
They don't like me.

621
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,500
And I defy physics.

622
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,280
What's happening?

623
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,140
Wait a second.

624
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,800
Isn't this the door that's like right here?

625
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,940
On the other side?

626
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,400
Oh!

627
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,780
Whoa!

628
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,460
We're outside!

629
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,960
Okay, now where do I need to go?

630
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,460
I'm in Europe!

631
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,800
Look up.

632
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,200
I did.

633
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,440
Whoa!

634
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,900
Oh, I didn't see that.

635
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,160
Holy cow.

636
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,140
Oh!

637
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,560
Hi!

638
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,560
Oh.

639
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,700
Yeah.

640
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,700
Show them how much of a freak you are.

641
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,800
When do I get to be able to run?

642
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,720
Oh my gosh.

643
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,320
Stop following me, freak!

644
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,180
What's going on in there?

645
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,460
Okay.

646
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,020
Sorry.

647
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,760
Soon?

648
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,220
Okay.

649
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:30,980
Not yet.

650
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,800
Oh!

651
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,020
Hello.

652
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,120
Okay.

653
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
I'd like to help you, but it's not a question.

654
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,380
Ow!

655
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,040
Stop flashing my eyes, please!

656
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,720
Okay, I'm guessing we get around by going this way, but I want to explore a little bit more beforehand.

657
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:51,920
Hello!

658
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,760
Okay.

659
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,940
Is that a turret there?

660
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,240
Okay.

661
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,020
Interesting.

662
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,860
Interesting, interesting.

663
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,460
Tis himself.

664
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,500
Thank you so much for five gifts.

665
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,080
Thank you.

666
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,460
The paparazzi!

667
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,880
I'm your biggest friend, I'll follow you until you love me.

668
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,440
Oh!

669
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,780
What is that?

670
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,020
Paparazzi!

671
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,460
Can we get over here?

672
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:19,540
Here.

673
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,940
This one has a little bit of...

674
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,540
...stuff around.

675
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,520
The barbed wire, you know.

676
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,440
What is this?

677
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,240
Oh!

678
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:29,660
Ah!

679
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,120
Oh!

680
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,620
Okay!

681
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,280
I'm sorry!

682
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,220
Everything's taking my pictures!

683
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,060
Stop!

684
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:35,820
Please!

685
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,700
I need access to get in there.

686
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,100
Okay.

687
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,700
Golly!

688
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,000
Okay, so there's nothing else really around here.

689
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,700
It's irrelevant.

690
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,460
Oh!

691
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,000
Wow!

692
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,140
They're like...

693
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,280
You ask for the evidence, we will give it to you.

694
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,180
We will provide.

695
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,360
Does Photoshop not exist in this...

696
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,440
...in this future?

697
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,060
Alright.

698
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,620
No, no.

699
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,220
No, please.

700
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,040
No photos.

701
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,780
Wait, there's a...

702
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,460
There's...

703
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,880
...

704
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,600
...

705
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,470
...

706
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:29,490
...

707
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:30,950
I made it?

708
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,470
Wait, I can be here.

709
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,630
Okay, this is fine.

710
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,790
Oh my gosh, wait!

711
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,670
Oh my gosh!

712
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,770
Witnessing a...

713
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,330
...

714
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:42,370
...

715
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:42,750
Something.

716
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,290
Is this roleplay?

717
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,270
Okay.

718
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,850
They don't need a...

719
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,910
They don't need a third.

720
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,690
It's fine.

721
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,030
Hello?

722
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,270
This is how it always starts.

723
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,550
First the building, then the whole block.

724
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,210
They have no reason to come to our place.

725
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,250
Don't worry, they'll find one.

726
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,390
What's going on?

727
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,770
Tell me.

728
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,370
What's happening?

729
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,130
Not that you just looked at me with shifty eyes.

730
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,510
There's even a playground here!

731
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,370
Oh, come on.

732
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,410
Eh...

733
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,430
Oop!

734
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,510
One day?

735
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,710
One...

736
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,150
Yeah!

737
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,890
We're missing a piece though.

738
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:27,750
Oh!

739
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:28,990
A baby!

740
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm a mother.

741
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,400
Let me in.

742
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,820
Oh!

743
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,640
Yes?

744
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,340
But what's going on in there?

745
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,900
Be free my baby!

746
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,540
Go live your life!

747
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,750
Okay.

748
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,030
Please don't let me in.

749
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,990
Can I play on this?

750
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,550
Woo!

751
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,530
I love the physics.

752
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,650
Oh my gosh.

753
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,750
Physics!

754
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,370
Physics!

755
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:11,910
I'm getting dizzy.

756
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,090
Perfect parenting.

757
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:14,470
Yeah.

758
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,230
You could say...

759
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,170
Can I hit this thing?

760
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,750
Well...

761
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,870
If I...

762
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,990
If I didn't have actual noodle arms, maybe.

763
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,310
Don't think that's how babies work.

764
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,170
It's like...

765
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,530
Finding a stray kitten.

766
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,640
I do not have a flashlight.

767
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,280
Someone's using the potty.

768
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,380
What's upstairs?

769
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,620
Hello?

770
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,280
Hello?

771
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,280
Oh!

772
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,240
What's going on?

773
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,600
Oh!

774
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,540
Hey, hold on.

775
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,680
What's...

776
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,560
What's going on?

777
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,560
Hi!

778
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
What's happening?

779
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,740
He's one of us.

780
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:02,720
Yeah?

781
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,400
I told you they'd be coming for us next.

782
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,080
What's going on?

783
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,460
Just at this point.

784
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,180
I hope you're wrong.

785
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,720
Oh!

786
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,620
It's a...

787
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,500
It's a...

788
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,060
It's a...

789
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,380
Oh!

790
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,580
No!

791
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,340
What are those...

792
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,200
What are those cars called?

793
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,200
A Cybertruck!

794
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,300
Oh, fuck!

795
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:35,740
Oh!

796
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,160
Sorry.

797
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,180
You scared me.

798
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,600
I can't take it anymore.

799
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,100
What are we going to do?

800
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,080
Does anyone have doors?

801
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:45,920
Or...

802
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,280
Can I turn this guy off?

803
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,680
When is it all going to end?

804
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,260
Please!

805
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,120
Oh my god!

806
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,180
He doesn't shut up!

807
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,380
Please!

808
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,660
Shut up!

809
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,190
Can't see anything in here.

810
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,510
Okay.

811
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:15,930
Sorry.

812
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,410
Uh...

813
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:17,810
I don't...

814
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,150
Attention, resident.

815
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:19,910
What...

816
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,650
Why am I getting...

817
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:20,990
Why?

818
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,470
Why?

819
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,150
Ah!

820
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:23,970
Why?

821
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,370
Ouch!

822
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,270
Oh, I...

823
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,750
Oh, please!

824
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,770
I'm trying to leave!

825
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,410
Ouch!

826
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:28,890
Ow!

827
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:29,730
Ow!

828
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,090
Wait!

829
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,230
I'm trying to get out of here!

830
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:34,770
Ow!

831
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:35,530
Ouch!

832
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:35,790
Ouch!

833
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,670
I'm leaving!

834
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:39,990
I'm leaving!

835
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,450
I'm leaving!

836
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,290
I'm leaving!

837
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:41,830
I can't see anything.

838
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:43,850
Hey, you!

839
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:44,990
In here!

840
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:45,610
Okay, thank you.

841
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,170
The roof?

842
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,950
There's no time to lose!

843
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,310
Ah!

844
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,010
Was it me?

845
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,790
What did I do?

846
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:55,870
Where's the roof?

847
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,730
Failure of the robbery will result in...

848
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,670
Oh!

849
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,270
Oh my god!

850
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:00,610
Oh my god!

851
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,290
I don't know anything that's happening!

852
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,650
Get in here, quick!

853
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,230
I'm in here!

854
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:05,530
Moving!

855
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,130
Oh my god!

856
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:07,210
Give me a gun!

857
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,370
Come inside!

858
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,090
Who's hurt?

859
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,590
I didn't get to...

860
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,570
I didn't get to explore!

861
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,530
Oh my god!

862
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,110
They're shooting me!

863
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:21,610
They're shooting me!

864
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,150
They're shooting me!

865
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:23,830
Look at me!

866
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:27,610
Ah!

867
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,610
Ah!

868
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,520
Ah!

869
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:35,660
Ow!

870
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,880
Where do I go?

871
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,320
Oh, well, um...

872
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,830
Guys, I, um... I couldn't... I didn't know where to go.

873
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,810
There were planks?

874
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,050
Oh, I totally missed it.

875
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,470
Um, one moment.

876
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,710
Where are they?

877
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,950
Ouch!

878
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,390
Ouch!

879
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,190
Where?

880
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:11,650
Behind...

881
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,850
The ears!

882
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,290
Are they down here?

883
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:15,830
Ouch!

884
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:16,530
Oh, no!

885
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,030
Ouch!

886
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,450
Ouch!

887
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,470
Ouch!

888
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,550
Follow the wall.

889
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,390
The right side.

890
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,630
I'm really stupid, you guys.

891
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,030
Why?

892
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,090
Okay, follow the wall.

893
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,570
She's black!

894
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,710
Clearly I am!

895
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,390
Ah!

896
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,930
They're not helping!

897
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,130
Follow the wall!

898
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,470
Here?

899
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,830
Where am I supposed to go?

900
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,010
You guys!

901
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,750
They're the worst instructors ever.

902
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,150
I'm getting shot at!

903
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,370
I'm just trying to figure...

904
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,290
Oh, my gosh.

905
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,230
I see it.

906
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,950
The tiniest two little planks I've ever seen in my entire afterlife.

907
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,050
The birds!

908
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,150
Oh, the gosh.

909
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,230
Don't shoot the birds.

910
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,070
They're innocent!

911
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,830
The birds are innocent.

912
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,290
Would this have happened regardless?

913
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,010
Oh, yeah!

914
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,660
Escape the apartment block raid.

915
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,440
Oh, they're just attacking everybody?

916
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,140
Ugh!

917
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,840
I can't take it anymore!

918
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,320
Oh, my God!

919
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,040
Oh, my God!

920
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,920
Oh, my...

921
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,590
Script and ambush!

922
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,070
Oh!

923
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,170
Dr. Freeman, I presume.

924
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,290
That's me.

925
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,850
You can call me Gordon.

926
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,270
The combine can be slow to wake, but once they're up, you don't want to get in their way.

927
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,150
Okay.

928
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,530
They let you wear jeans?

929
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,930
Dr. Kleiner said you'd be coming this way.

930
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,490
I don't think it occurred to him that you might not have a map.

931
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,250
Oh, yeah!

932
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,130
And I'm...

933
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,870
I have an unhelpful chat, too!

934
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,210
I'm Alex Vance.

935
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,470
My father worked with you back in Black Mesa.

936
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,630
I'm sure you don't remember me.

937
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,130
You're so up on the feed!

938
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:40,950
That's so funny!

939
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,670
You're a few words, aren't you?

940
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,070
You're the blind one!

941
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,410
Remember him from Black Mesa?

942
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,490
Your old administrator.

943
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,990
Don't get my dad started on Dr. Breen.

944
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,010
I keep thinking of Neil Breen.

945
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,910
I can't help it.

946
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,410
Secrets!

947
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,790
Oh, yeah, she moonwalking.

948
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,470
She can't stop staring at me.

949
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,690
A red-letter day?

950
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,690
Why?

951
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:15,750
What's today?

952
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,910
All the sound effects are so great!

953
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,110
She's too cool.

954
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,350
Does that work?

955
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,270
Here.

956
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,750
Let me buy you a drink.

957
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,570
Are you just gonna punch it?

958
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,090
Wait, she's actually using money!

959
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:44,950
Oh!

960
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,490
What the?

961
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,010
Oh, and by the way...

962
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,530
Nice to finally meet you.

963
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,650
Oh my god.

964
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:51,870
Whoa!

965
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,730
Find all Lambda caches in Half-Life 2.

966
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:55,230
Wait, what?

967
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,750
Nice to meet you.

968
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,690
I'm here!

969
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,230
I'm here!

970
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,090
I'm here!

971
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,710
What was that?

972
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,630
I'll get her.

973
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,330
I'll get her.

974
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,130
I have physics.

975
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,430
That's me!

976
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,710
It really is you, isn't it?

977
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,110
Yeah.

978
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,930
I found him wandering around outside.

979
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,070
Bit of a troublemaker, isn't he?

980
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:43,350
We owe a great deal to Dr. Freeman, even if trouble does tend to follow in his wake.

981
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,970
I mean, it's not my fault.

982
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,730
I must say, Gordon, you come at a very opportune time.

983
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,850
I didn't see the planks either.

984
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,190
The final piece for our resurrected teleport.

985
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,450
I can't take any credit for the break here, Doctor.

986
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,290
Like, I thought it was gonna be me falling onto like a...

987
00:44:59,290 --> 00:44:59,630
What's it called?

988
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,370
Let's just see if this thing works, okay?

989
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,270
A box that would break my fall, you know?

990
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,030
Man, Gordon, you stirred up the hive.

991
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,490
Oh, the bunny!

992
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:09,850
Barney!

993
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,770
We can't keep him here long, Doc.

994
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,790
It'll jeopardize everything we've worked for.

995
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:14,270
Don't worry.

996
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,330
He's coming with me.

997
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,230
Push me?

998
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:16,850
That's right, Barney.

999
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,810
This is a red-letter day.

1000
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,230
We'll inaugurate the new teleport with a double transmission.

1001
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,570
You mean it's working?

1002
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,330
You mean it's working?

1003
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:24,930
For real this time?

1004
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,250
Because I still have nightmares about that cat.

1005
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:28,750
No, no.

1006
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,650
There's nothing to be nervous about.

1007
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,390
We've made major strides since then.

1008
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,790
Major strides.

1009
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,310
What cat?

1010
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:36,630
Cat?

1011
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,890
Since he's not taking the streets, you might as well get him out of his civvies.

1012
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:40,250
What?

1013
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,270
Oh, dear.

1014
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:41,870
Where's your cat?

1015
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:42,890
I almost forgot.

1016
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,370
Barney, I'll give you the honor.

1017
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,550
I've gotta get back on my ship.

1018
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,070
I've gotta get back on my ship.

1019
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:48,530
But okay.

1020
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,890
Are you gonna...

1021
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,450
Are you gonna dress me?

1022
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,930
Are you gonna Barbie doll me?

1023
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:54,970
Oh!

1024
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:55,610
Oh!

1025
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,050
Oh!

1026
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,030
Here we go.

1027
00:45:59,250 --> 00:45:59,670
Ah!

1028
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:00,910
Damn it!

1029
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:01,870
Get it off me!

1030
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:03,930
Oh!

1031
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:05,270
Oh!

1032
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:06,410
Oh!

1033
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:06,530
Oh!

1034
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:07,770
Oh!

1035
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,830
Oh!

1036
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,090
Oh!

1037
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,030
Oh!

1038
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,430
De-beaked?

1039
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,490
The worst she might do is attempt to couple with your head, fruitlessly.

1040
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,870
Get that thing away from me!

1041
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:20,910
Yeah, my pet.

1042
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,950
Hop up!

1043
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,530
Literal blind man.

1044
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,350
No, not up there!

1045
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,130
No!

1046
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,190
Careful Lamar!

1047
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:27,710
Oh my god.

1048
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,690
Those are quite fragile!

1049
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,790
The head crab sounds.

1050
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,050
Oh, fine.

1051
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,550
It'll be another week before I can coax her out of there.

1052
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:34,030
Nah!

1053
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,730
Longer if we're lucky.

1054
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,950
You have such a nice, smooth head though.

1055
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,990
You have to rip the CRT.

1056
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,410
Well, Gordon.

1057
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,210
Go ahead.

1058
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,950
Slip into your suit now.

1059
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,490
Why did they side-eye me so hard?

1060
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,370
If Dr. Kleiner says you should wear that thing, you should wear it.

1061
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:01,630
Okay.

1062
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,690
This bombastic side-eye.

1063
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,250
Barney doesn't though.

1064
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:12,710
Right, Barney?

1065
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,490
Barney actually...

1066
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,170
Come on, Gordon.

1067
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,710
We don't have time to fool around.

1068
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:17,550
Get your suit on.

1069
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:18,990
Okay, goodness.

1070
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:19,510
Hold on.

1071
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,950
Everybody was congratulating somebody and I wanna see what's happening.

1072
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,110
I wanna see what's up.

1073
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,930
Oh wait, did I miss it?

1074
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,870
No, please say no.

1075
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:27,970
No.

1076
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:28,790
Wait.

1077
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,470
Did I miss it?

1078
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,210
What happened?

1079
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,930
I wanna congratulate too.

1080
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,230
I wanna be part of the fun.

1081
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,510
He got to college!

1082
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,230
Yippee!

1083
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,550
Electrician college.

1084
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:46,010
Wow!

1085
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,150
You know, you have...

1086
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,190
You have a great career.

1087
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,350
Congratulations, Bron!

1088
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,510
The NPC's progressed the plot, VTuber.

1089
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,010
I know, I'm like...

1090
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,710
Oh!

1091
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,830
Oh, the valve sound.

1092
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,210
It's kinda freaky actually, hearing it like in-game.

1093
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,240
Whoa!

1094
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:14,280
Oh!

1095
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:15,720
Hey!

1096
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,000
Well, Gordon, I see your HEV suit still fits you like a glove.

1097
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
At least, the glove parts do.

1098
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:23,900
What am I...

1099
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,980
Did I grow taller?

1100
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,700
I need a few modifications, but I'll just acquaint you with the essentials.

1101
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,540
I could run now?

1102
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,940
Oh, yes I can!

1103
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,860
The Mark V hazardous environment suit has been redesigned for comfort and utility.

1104
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,420
Oh dear.

1105
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,500
Doc, we don't have time for this.

1106
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:41,720
Oh.

1107
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,320
At least get that suit you stopped, Gordon.

1108
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,080
Good idea.

1109
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,680
There's a charger on the wall.

1110
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:47,740
Huh?

1111
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,300
This one?

1112
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,300
I've modified your suit to draw power from combine energy outlets, which are plentiful wherever they patrol.

1113
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:56,920
Okay.

1114
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,140
I did, I held down.

1115
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,100
Oh, keep going?

1116
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,100
Nope, there's mo- There's no more.

1117
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,680
Meanwhile, let's get this show on the road.

1118
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,400
Okay.

1119
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,240
What's go- Oh, you got some blueprints here?

1120
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:10,900
What's going on?

1121
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,240
Aw.

1122
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,380
Aw.

1123
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:13,400
Oh.

1124
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:20,380
It's not just- I thought- Aw, I thought you were just hap- Who's the scratched out one?

1125
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,660
Hold on, I want to teleport the plant real quick.

1126
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,940
It's Breen?

1127
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:33,520
Aw.

1128
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,620
Icky, man.

1129
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,060
Wait.

1130
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:36,940
Hold on.

1131
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,340
Okay, hold on.

1132
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:38,880
Hold on.

1133
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,600
I'll get it.

1134
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,140
One second!

1135
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,190
Does it have to be perfectly in there?

1136
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,190
Yeah, the yapper.

1137
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,980
Oh!

1138
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,420
How cute!

1139
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:08,340
Cute!

1140
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,700
It still worked, you guys.

1141
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,600
It still worked.

1142
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,760
I'm touching everything.

1143
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,480
Oh!

1144
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,740
What's this?

1145
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It keeps moving around.

1146
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,200
Hold on!

1147
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,820
I'm reading!

1148
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,860
Hazardous environment suit.

1149
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,020
Okay.

1150
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,840
What are we doing?

1151
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,700
Sorry, I really like to look at everything, you guys.

1152
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,520
I'm so sorry.

1153
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:34,980
Haha.

1154
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,720
See the zoom?

1155
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,220
Why don't you position yourself near the panel over there and wait for my work.

1156
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,540
Isaac, are you there?

1157
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,260
Yes, yes, Eli.

1158
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,320
Bit of a hold up.

1159
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,200
Do I need to go in there?

1160
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,520
You'll never guess who found his way into our lab this morning.

1161
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,800
That's not who I think it is, is it?

1162
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,280
Indeed it is.

1163
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,980
And it's our intention to send him packing straight away in the company of your lovely daughter.

1164
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,580
Are you ready for us, dad?

1165
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,680
We're all set on this end.

1166
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,900
Then let's do it.

1167
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,240
Cool!

1168
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,440
See ya!

1169
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,920
Barney, don't you like me anymore?

1170
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,040
Why'd you just take a step back?

1171
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:14,860
Huh?

1172
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,200
Hey, uh, yeah, about that cat.

1173
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,520
The cat!

1174
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,440
Two...

1175
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:25,800
One...

1176
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:27,600
No...

1177
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:27,840
No...

1178
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,320
Thin-sticks.

1179
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,000
What now?

1180
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,140
Uh...

1181
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,980
Doctor...

1182
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,360
The plug.

1183
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,440
Uh, dear me.

1184
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,360
You're right.

1185
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:34,660
Oh.

1186
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,980
Gordon, would you mind...

1187
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,500
Plugging us in?

1188
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,560
Be a dear and plug you in?

1189
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,100
I can- I see!

1190
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,400
I'm not that blind.

1191
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:42,860
Oh my god.

1192
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,020
You gonna let Gordon throw the switch?

1193
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,640
Gordon, go right ahead.

1194
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,740
Where's the switch now?

1195
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,140
This?

1196
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:51,800
Very good.

1197
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,320
Final sequence.

1198
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,880
Commencing...

1199
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,520
Now, I can't look.

1200
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,200
They knew.

1201
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:00,920
Okay.

1202
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,280
Are you feeling funny?

1203
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,140
Oh no!

1204
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,050
Ho ho!

1205
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,430
Well, did it work?

1206
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,790
See for yourself.

1207
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,230
He died!

1208
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,010
Oh my god!

1209
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,030
My relief is almost palpable.

1210
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,710
Fantastic work, is it?

1211
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,910
Well, I can't take all the credit.

1212
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:26,330
She did.

1213
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,690
Dr. Freeman proved an able assistant.

1214
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,110
I plugged in.

1215
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:30,770
I didn't.

1216
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:31,290
I...

1217
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:31,990
Right you are.

1218
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,830
Speak to you again in a few moments.

1219
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,070
I can't- You can't take all the credit.

1220
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:36,850
I just got you.

1221
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,690
I can see your MIT education really pays for itself.

1222
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:40,130
What?

1223
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,250
Are they making fun of me?

1224
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:42,910
Gee, thanks.

1225
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,930
Gordon, as soon as you're in position, we'll send you to Eli's.

1226
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:47,450
Okay.

1227
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,830
Not a moment too soon.

1228
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,770
Mom, stop teasing me.

1229
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,950
Oh my god, it kind of looks like...

1230
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,230
In three, two, one.

1231
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,570
Something from Portal, no?

1232
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,930
Barney, if you'd be so kind.

1233
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,310
Good luck out there, Gordon.

1234
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,350
Yes indeed.

1235
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:05,170
Barney!

1236
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,230
Barney!

1237
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,550
Best of luck in your future endeavors.

1238
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,490
Final sequence.

1239
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:13,470
Uh oh.

1240
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:13,650
The hell?

1241
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:14,690
What is it?

1242
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:15,170
Uh oh.

1243
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,230
It's your anchor-freaking headhopper.

1244
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,430
Oh no.

1245
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:19,410
Uh oh.

1246
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:21,470
No.

1247
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,330
No.

1248
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:23,490
No!

1249
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,410
It's Lamar with him.

1250
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,550
Get about that thing.

1251
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,470
It's Lamar with him.

1252
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,150
I'm here!

1253
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:29,130
Oh my gosh.

1254
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,010
Booty shot!

1255
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:33,190
Okay!

1256
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,050
What's the meaning of this?

1257
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,610
Who are you?

1258
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,270
How did you get in here?

1259
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:39,770
Uh.

1260
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:45,350
This is crazy!

1261
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:46,950
This is so awesome!

1262
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:51,150
I feel like I'm on like some universal ride, you know?

1263
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,030
Don't worry, Gordon.

1264
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:52,930
There he is!

1265
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,590
Oh, we're losing him again!

1266
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:55,410
Booty shot!

1267
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:56,470
Booty shot!

1268
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:56,830
Booty shot!

1269
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:57,930
All but certain, it was...

1270
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,570
Gordon Freeman.

1271
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,630
Then,

1272
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,390
where is he?

1273
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:10,970
I'm behind you!

1274
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:12,930
Shut it down!

1275
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,630
Shut it down!

1276
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:13,870
Gordon!

1277
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,950
You must get out of here!

1278
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:16,490
Run!

1279
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,790
Get down out of sight!

1280
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:18,910
I'll come find you!

1281
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,410
What do you mean, get down out of sight?

1282
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:22,390
Oh my gosh.

1283
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,450
I'm sprinting?

1284
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,430
Uh, this way?

1285
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,950
Come find me!

1286
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:33,470
Please!

1287
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,690
What the hell?

1288
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,300
Oh!

1289
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:40,840
Oh!

1290
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,700
We're good!

1291
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,600
We made it!

1292
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,320
I think!

1293
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,450
Is there something to climb?

1294
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,290
Did I miss something on the ground?

1295
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,670
Or these?

1296
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:10,930
Hey, Gordon!

1297
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:11,390
Oh!

1298
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:12,470
Yes?

1299
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,630
Hi!

1300
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,750
The Citadel's on full alert.

1301
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,290
I've never seen it lit up like that.

1302
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,430
Get out of City 17 as fast as you can, Gordon.

1303
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,050
Take the old canals, right?

1304
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,450
They'll get you to Eli's lab.

1305
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,050
It's a dangerous route, but there's a whole network of refugees, and they'll help you if they can.

1306
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:32,050
I'd come with you, but I gotta look after Dr. Kleiner.

1307
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,070
Oh, and before I forget, I think you dropped this back in Black Mesa.

1308
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:37,670
Stop!

1309
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,310
Good luck out there, buddy.

1310
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,590
You're gonna need it.

1311
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,610
Thank you, Barney!

1312
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,090
Okay, so we go through...

1313
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,070
We're going through the sewers?

1314
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,030
I forgot to ask, does this game have like, autosave?

1315
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,230
Okay, it does, but I should probably just like, save when I can do.

1316
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,350
The canals.

1317
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:10,690
Uh...

1318
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,270
I do.

1319
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,790
Oh my gosh.

1320
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,190
Ah!

1321
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,530
I hate these things so much.

1322
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,230
Uh...

1323
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,190
I'm just gonna...

1324
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:23,950
Where?

1325
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,090
I'm just running for it.

1326
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,230
Oh, and I can't go that way.

1327
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:31,610
Uh...

1328
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:45,460
And...

1329
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:45,960
Where to go.

1330
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:47,740
No, no.

1331
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,880
Please, don't take a picture of me.

1332
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:49,940
I really hate you.

1333
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,700
Uh...

1334
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,320
No, please.

1335
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,220
Please, no photos.

1336
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,480
They're so obsessed with me.

1337
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,620
Up there!

1338
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,480
I think I messed up.

1339
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,100
I think I messed up.

1340
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,300
Hold on.

1341
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,680
Maybe I can go underneath the train.

1342
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,860
Ah!

1343
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,680
I messed up everybody.

1344
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,800
Is there a train that's open?

1345
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:16,580
Ah!

1346
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,080
Ah!

1347
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,000
We're good.

1348
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:30,800
Everything's fine.

1349
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,310
Ah!

1350
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,350
Everything's not fine!

1351
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:34,770
Ah!

1352
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,150
Everything's not fine!

1353
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,480
Okay, everything's fine.

1354
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,660
The music is very good, huh?

1355
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:02,620
Yeah.

1356
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,760
Oh my gosh.

1357
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,100
I'm running, I'm running.

1358
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,520
And, um...

1359
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,260
Maybe this way.

1360
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,180
Uh...

1361
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,420
Trying to find a way...

1362
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,660
In?

1363
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,040
Perhaps this direction?

1364
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,440
I wish I had a gun.

1365
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,680
I'd take those guys down.

1366
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,920
Easy peasy!

1367
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,300
No?

1368
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,120
Oh my god.

1369
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,260
I gotta jump?

1370
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:33,700
Okay.

1371
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,020
Oh, from...

1372
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:36,980
Uh...

1373
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,220
Where?

1374
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,400
Oh my god.

1375
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,180
Please.

1376
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:42,880
Please, sir.

1377
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,360
I'm just trying to find a way around.

1378
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,520
Or...

1379
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,680
How did I...

1380
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,240
How did I get on the top of the thing anyway?

1381
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:49,720
I don't remember.

1382
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,580
Is it here?

1383
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,480
Yeah, here we go.

1384
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:55,900
Okay.

1385
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,480
I see.

1386
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,200
From inside the car, yeah.

1387
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:00,980
Wait!

1388
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:08,810
Whew!

1389
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,110
We made it!

1390
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:10,750
We're fine!

1391
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:13,830
We're

1392
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,000
fine!

1393
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,500
The Root Canal.

1394
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,960
I tricked people into paying me to do...

1395
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,820
For doing work again.

1396
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,440
Oh!

1397
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,880
That's exciting.

1398
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,140
E the whole...

1399
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:29,720
Oh, nice.

1400
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,640
My health is not so bad though.

1401
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,660
Shocking.

1402
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:35,660
Actually.

1403
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,130
I got you.

1404
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,210
You better run.

1405
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,610
There's nothing else you can do here.

1406
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,750
They were already looking for me!

1407
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:54,710
Oh, I have their gun.

1408
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:55,190
My bad.

1409
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,610
Wait.

1410
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,260
If I do this, they'll explode and they'll never know.

1411
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,390
What about that guy?

1412
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:10,910
Is he okay?

1413
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,230
Wait, hold on.

1414
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,870
I'm gonna go heal.

1415
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:17,810
Okay.

1416
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,090
They don't explode anymore!

1417
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:23,210
Depressing.

1418
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,470
I like how she's like, they'll be looking for you now.

1419
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,010
Honey, they already were.

1420
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:35,950
Come here.

1421
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:36,770
Come here, you.

1422
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:40,210
Yeah!

1423
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,600
The sound of them dying is kind of spooky.

1424
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,820
Not gonna lie.

1425
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,260
Not gonna lie.

1426
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:01,600
Look, someone said...

1427
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,360
F6 is...

1428
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,040
Is...

1429
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,980
Quick save, is that true?

1430
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,420
Yeah, they like actually flatline.

1431
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,580
It's kind of spooky.

1432
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,300
F5.

1433
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,460
F6.

1434
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,000
Ah!

1435
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,120
It is F6.

1436
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,480
It's F6, everybody.

1437
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,720
At least for me.

1438
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,100
I don't like how I only have so much stamina.

1439
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,080
That's new, right?

1440
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:35,800
I had...

1441
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,120
I'm limited before, no?

1442
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,860
Anything in here?

1443
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,920
It is new.

1444
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:49,460
Yeah.

1445
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,540
Makes me quite sad.

1446
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,380
Ooh!

1447
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,560
Will this hit me?

1448
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,480
I should have tested it.

1449
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,840
Can I jump on it?

1450
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,480
Can I hitch a ride?

1451
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:11,770
Oh.

1452
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,310
Oh, well.

1453
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,090
Okay.

1454
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,070
Try on top?

1455
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,610
How do I even get on?

1456
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,490
Oh, wait!

1457
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:26,550
On top.

1458
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:30,480
What?

1459
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,090
Uh...

1460
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:34,990
This is actually...

1461
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:35,590
Maybe safer.

1462
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:37,790
Oh,

1463
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:44,950
why do I have to have sprint?

1464
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,870
Oh, and I can't go through here.

1465
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:48,970
Okay.

1466
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,940
How'd I fail that jump?

1467
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,720
I didn't fail.

1468
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,240
I literally landed on it.

1469
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,160
What are you talking about?

1470
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,980
Okay, hold on.

1471
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:08,570
I'll sit right here.

1472
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:09,690
No.

1473
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,030
Right here.

1474
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,220
No unlimited run.

1475
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:19,960
Oh, okay.

1476
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:20,380
Nevermind.

1477
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,880
This bar does not actually...

1478
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,420
It's not a functional bar.

1479
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,270
Oh my god.

1480
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:39,130
I can snipe.

1481
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,170
No, I can't.

1482
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:40,870
You can't.

1483
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:45,350
You can't.

1484
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:46,950
You can't shoot and zoom at the same time.

1485
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:48,750
The red barrels.

1486
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,490
A little delayed.

1487
01:03:58,730 --> 01:03:59,630
But they...

1488
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:03,590
What the hell?

1489
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:07,210
Don't call for more people, you bastard!

1490
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:09,170
Oh my god.

1491
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:09,890
That's evil.

1492
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,870
Uh...

1493
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,940
I can hide, too.

1494
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,040
Oh, my gosh.

1495
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,680
Quit running.

1496
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,740
I got his ass.

1497
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,340
Okay, now I have to, like, remember what the...

1498
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,960
Or, like, know what the new things look like, you know?

1499
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,240
I'm afraid someone's gonna shoot that and blow me up!

1500
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,100
Is this a game?

1501
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:55,640
Is this a game where you want to always be quicksaving, too?

1502
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,240
Kind of like the previous game?

1503
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,940
I think I have to blow it up.

1504
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,260
Jeez!

1505
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:07,900
Oh, wait!

1506
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:09,400
Not really?

1507
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,080
Okay.

1508
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,140
Good to know.

1509
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:15,770
Oh, shoot!

1510
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,590
Oh, where are you?

1511
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,780
I killed somebody.

1512
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,700
I'm a murdering machine!

1513
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:34,260
Oh!

1514
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:36,340
I didn't even notice.

1515
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,780
Oh, yeah, we...

1516
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,250
Oh, there we go.

1517
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:46,610
If it looks like a parkour scene, embrace the interaction here.

1518
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,770
Oh, my gosh!

1519
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:50,290
I can't even talk to my chat!

1520
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:51,490
You guys are so rude!

1521
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:51,650
Dude!

1522
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,930
I'm guessing they just spawn unlimited...

1523
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,550
And that I...

1524
01:05:58,550 --> 01:05:58,990
Um...

1525
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:00,090
Parkour.

1526
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:02,490
And that I...

1527
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:04,990
Wait, where do I parkour to?

1528
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,870
Where...

1529
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,210
Ah, I see!

1530
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:09,990
This is a wall.

1531
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:10,570
Okay, okay.

1532
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:15,310
Huh!

1533
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:15,910
Whip!

1534
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:16,270
Ah!

1535
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,770
Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop.

1536
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:21,850
Where'd he go?

1537
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:23,230
Oh, my goodness.

1538
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,530
I think the other guy is still.

1539
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:30,150
Woo!

1540
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,970
I'm gonna run out of bullets because of you guys!

1541
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:34,270
Please!

1542
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:39,250
Oh, my God.

1543
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,170
Oh, I see it.

1544
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:49,230
Nice, fancy.

1545
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:52,230
What?

1546
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:56,910
Thank you!

1547
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,540
Always be on your guard in this game.

1548
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:04,620
Come here.

1549
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,400
Where's your head?

1550
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:06,820
Right...

1551
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,180
There.

1552
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,240
I'm just gonna run.

1553
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,960
And I'm gonna...

1554
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,440
Where's how to get down?

1555
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,620
Gosh!

1556
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:19,920
Hole?

1557
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,200
Oh, yeah.

1558
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:23,580
Whip!

1559
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,200
Oh, no!

1560
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,400
Not on me!

1561
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,900
Oh, uh...

1562
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,680
The train again.

1563
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:36,640
Wait, what's this?

1564
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:38,280
Meow.

1565
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:41,780
The goal?

1566
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:43,960
Oh, my Jesus!

1567
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,420
Hole things considered?

1568
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,680
We're okay.

1569
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:53,800
Oh, shoot.

1570
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,640
No!

1571
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,400
Why did you...

1572
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,800
The anger alert?

1573
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,800
I feel like I'm in doom all of a sudden.

1574
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,610
I don't know.

1575
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:13,490
Not quite sure...

1576
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:20,500
Not quite sure which way I'm supposed to go...

1577
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,360
I guess up these stairs.

1578
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,700
That are very obviously here to go up.

1579
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,100
Maybe look around, stupid.

1580
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,280
Yep!

1581
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:57,300
Wait, where's the...

1582
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,160
Oh, here, there we go.

1583
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,640
Oh, my gosh.

1584
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:01,940
Please, my aim.

1585
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:02,840
My aim.

1586
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:08,270
Okay.

1587
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,390
I guess?

1588
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:12,170
Oh.

1589
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:17,870
Uh-oh.

1590
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:19,390
My ammo.

1591
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:25,550
You're like right in front of me.

1592
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:26,230
How am I missing?

1593
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:37,250
More things.

1594
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,350
Oh, this game is like... there's stuff everywhere.

1595
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,210
I mean, I know I'm like early right now.

1596
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,510
But, like early level, you know.

1597
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:49,770
Uh-oh.

1598
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:50,890
Uh-oh.

1599
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,560
Am I supposed to go down?

1600
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,520
Is there anything down there?

1601
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,100
I guess so.

1602
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,200
We're going, baby.

1603
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,360
We're really going.

1604
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,380
We're flying.

1605
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,640
Also, did someone say Dusko?

1606
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,080
Hi, Dusko!

1607
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:24,440
Hello.

1608
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:25,680
Space.

1609
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,180
Again.

1610
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,260
I'm swimming up whether I want to or not.

1611
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,130
All right.

1612
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:44,490
All right, baby.

1613
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:48,290
Get me in.

1614
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,230
I'm too fat.

1615
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:53,690
Too fat.

1616
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:54,770
Oh.

1617
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:56,930
God.

1618
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:59,470
Hi.

1619
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,390
Good thing you found us.

1620
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,870
You're not the first to come through here.

1621
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:04,810
This is the free man.

1622
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,170
The Combine's reckoning has come.

1623
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:09,410
Look.

1624
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,390
Booty shot.

1625
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:11,470
Booty shot.

1626
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,370
Main station's right around the corner.

1627
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,870
They'll get you started on the right foot.

1628
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,050
They'll get you started on the right foot.

1629
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,510
Meanwhile, let my Vortigaunt friend here give you a jolt to get you going.

1630
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:21,570
Will you?

1631
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:23,570
Wait.

1632
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,250
This is so crazy.

1633
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,620
You really can't afford to get noticed.

1634
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,520
Civil protection catched you down here.

1635
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,280
It's bad news for the whole railroad.

1636
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,660
We deserve the same victory.

1637
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:40,780
Resist.

1638
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:41,900
Okay.

1639
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:42,600
See ya.

1640
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,100
Thank you.

1641
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,000
Booty shot.

1642
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,000
Booty shot.

1643
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,280
It would've healed if it wasn't full.

1644
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,900
I guess it doesn't do my suit.

1645
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,600
Which is understandable, I suppose.

1646
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,880
But still sad.

1647
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:57,140
Oh.

1648
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,060
You killed the baby brain in the first game and freed them.

1649
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,360
Oh, they viewed me as a he...

1650
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,220
Ouch!

1651
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,780
Oh, I see.

1652
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,420
I freed them.

1653
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,620
Booty shot.

1654
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,620
Booty shot.

1655
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,050
No way!

1656
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,680
That's crazy!

1657
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,060
If I take long enough, will he...

1658
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,240
Will he come back down?

1659
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,320
The ropes.

1660
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:45,660
Oh!

1661
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:46,320
Oh!

1662
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,460
Yes, indeedy.

1663
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,800
Oh, wow!

1664
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,180
Wow!

1665
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,440
Wait, that's awesome.

1666
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,740
That's so cool.

1667
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:06,440
Oh, yeah.

1668
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,120
You guys were just telling me to distract it.

1669
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:08,980
With the skull.

1670
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,560
I was way ahead of you.

1671
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,940
Ew, what am I walking through?

1672
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,280
No!

1673
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,600
I could've saved them.

1674
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,920
I was too busy getting...

1675
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:36,300
What?

1676
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,060
Oh my god.

1677
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:42,560
Oh my god.

1678
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:42,880
Oh my god.

1679
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,300
Oh my god.

1680
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:43,720
Oh my god.

1681
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:44,060
Oh my god.

1682
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:44,680
I'm just shooting.

1683
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,200
Holy...

1684
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:53,040
Holy hell!

1685
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,320
Absolute ambush!

1686
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,020
I did not save them.

1687
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,680
I did not save them.

1688
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,180
Is this what you were talking about in here?

1689
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,180
Okay, I know there's those guys over here.

1690
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,580
Holy hell.

1691
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,480
They're crazy.

1692
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,040
I'm not even hitting you at all.

1693
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,020
There's another tunnel.

1694
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,360
Hold on.

1695
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,040
I got so distracted with the people yelling, I didn't even look around.

1696
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,080
Another tunnel.

1697
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,980
I think maybe I go through the car.

1698
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,720
The slop sound is disgusting.

1699
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:51,800
Jesus.

1700
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,260
Oh my gosh, I can't hit him at all.

1701
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,040
I can't hit him at all.

1702
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:58,900
Okay, I'm gonna try.

1703
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,620
If I die, I die.

1704
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:00,980
It's fine.

1705
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:01,620
Oh.

1706
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,540
Oh god, don't go through the car!

1707
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,060
Don't go through the car.

1708
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,310
The crowbar, let's try it.

1709
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:31,110
No?

1710
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:32,530
It's okay.

1711
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:36,990
We li- we- well... I- I die and learn, you know?

1712
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,050
It's just the ghost way.

1713
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,350
It's just the ghost way.

1714
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,330
By the boxes?

1715
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,390
Oh, there!

1716
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,150
I see, I see.

1717
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:44,030
Okay.

1718
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:46,090
Ah!

1719
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,390
Thank you.

1720
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:49,650
Thanks, guys!

1721
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:04,930
We have a lot of stuff in there.

1722
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:06,570
Hey, y'all.

1723
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,750
Station 12, come in.

1724
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:11,470
Station- This is Station 8.

1725
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,170
We heard 12 go down and out.

1726
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,850
Surgical strike units are targeting railway stations.

1727
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:17,290
Repeat.

1728
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:20,590
Civil protection is coming down on underground stations.

1729
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:23,110
We're already getting refugees from Nine and Outline.

1730
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,570
Looks like we're- Station 8, do you copy?

1731
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:26,870
Station 8, do you copy?

1732
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:29,090
Oh, I just realized my flashlight also uses power.

1733
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,350
Station 8, are you there?

1734
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:30,290
Crazy.

1735
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:31,490
Bill, thank you so much!

1736
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,110
We have confirmed reports of manhacks.

1737
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:35,170
Manhacks.

1738
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,170
What's a manhack?

1739
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:37,510
Uh-oh.

1740
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:41,490
They're filling the underground with- With what?

1741
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,010
You'll find out.

1742
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,350
Sorry, I keep saving now.

1743
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,490
Because I'm scared.

1744
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,740
That's what they were using.

1745
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:05,800
Bastards.

1746
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,060
I was like, why are they shooting so hard?

1747
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:16,920
Hope I didn't need that.

1748
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:23,920
Yeah!

1749
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,500
Oh, it doesn't shoot that far.

1750
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,300
Um...

1751
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:47,400
Ah!

1752
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,180
Got my gun!

1753
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:56,980
Ah!

1754
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,290
Wait, oh shoot.

1755
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:05,390
I'm stuck.

1756
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:09,810
Kinda

1757
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,160
like blowing up everything.

1758
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,040
Okay.

1759
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,980
I was hoping that they would blow up the debris, you know?

1760
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,680
So I could get through.

1761
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,140
But I don't think that's the case.

1762
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,620
Why is it goopy?

1763
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:36,260
Yip!

1764
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,240
Yip!

1765
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:37,580
Yip!

1766
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,160
Yip!

1767
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:38,640
Yip!

1768
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,400
I can't, I don't know how to use the ladders yet!

1769
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,160
The planks.

1770
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:46,800
Okay, hold on.

1771
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,700
Let me loop again.

1772
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,140
We'll loop a loop.

1773
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,140
The planks, Minky!

1774
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,360
Where are the planks?

1775
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,860
Why can't I ever see the planks?

1776
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,040
Oh, that right there, I see, I see.

1777
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,220
Okay, we're running.

1778
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,020
Oh my gosh.

1779
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,040
I'm not good at using these stinking ladders.

1780
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:03,920
Okay.

1781
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:04,780
Up.

1782
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,380
Over.

1783
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:05,980
Here we go.

1784
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:07,420
And we're running.

1785
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:07,940
We're running.

1786
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:08,480
We're running.

1787
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,040
We're running.

1788
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:09,480
We're running.

1789
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:09,680
We're running.

1790
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,000
I see!

1791
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:14,280
Thanks, guys!

1792
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,320
Oh!

1793
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,240
You sick.

1794
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:20,440
Oh!

1795
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:21,600
Oh my gosh.

1796
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,860
I have to be careful.

1797
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:25,560
Hello?

1798
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,620
Please go walk through.

1799
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,440
Hello?

1800
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,700
Why can't I crouch and walk?

1801
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,120
There we go.

1802
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,540
You're sick.

1803
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,700
You're sick!

1804
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:34,720
Oh.

1805
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,140
I think I have to kill this one.

1806
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,420
Die?

1807
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:58,120
I sound so gross.

1808
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,460
Soul.

1809
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,580
Midnight.

1810
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:15,720
Where?

1811
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,920
Oh my god.

1812
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,420
I'm gonna stay here in case any others come through.

1813
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,520
Gotta keep the railway alive.

1814
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,220
Aww.

1815
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,580
Be safe in there, though.

1816
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:34,860
Jump scare.

1817
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,720
She's over here!

1818
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,040
I'm right next to you!

1819
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:38,440
Like...

1820
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:51,620
Like...

1821
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,880
Booty shot!

1822
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:53,740
Booty shot!

1823
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:54,840
Booty shot!

1824
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:12,050
That doesn't look open.

1825
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,050
Will I dive?

1826
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,170
Oh my gosh!

1827
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,470
I'm waiting for suspect.

1828
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,870
Uh-oh.

1829
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:25,350
Uh-oh.

1830
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:26,350
Uh...

1831
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,670
Surely the water will...

1832
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:28,550
Um...

1833
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:30,410
Wait...

1834
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,770
The water will protect me, right?

1835
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:34,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1836
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:36,530
Uh-oh.

1837
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,890
My oxygen is...

1838
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,750
Oh my gosh.

1839
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,550
Oh my gosh.

1840
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:41,130
Oh my gosh.

1841
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:43,710
Jump!

1842
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:44,210
Jump!

1843
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:44,470
Jump!

1844
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:48,070
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1845
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:49,750
Holy...

1846
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,290
Hold on, I gotta let my power restore.

1847
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:54,250
Oh my gosh!

1848
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,510
I just hear them everywhere.

1849
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:09,020
Explosives and water will kill from a lot further because it is incompressible.

1850
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,540
Yeah, don't listen to video games, guys.

1851
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,880
Weird that your air and your flashlight use the same meter.

1852
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:27,180
I'm not a huge fan of it at the moment, but, you know, I'm sure we'll... Eventually.

1853
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:44,050
I don't like rushing because I'm blind and I don't know where to go.

1854
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:49,670
I don't see, you know, see well.

1855
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,250
So, I don't always... I don't like to rush.

1856
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:56,390
Oops!

1857
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:57,750
I didn't know you were up there!

1858
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:58,950
Sorry, mister!

1859
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:01,910
Oh, shoot.

1860
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,130
Come on!

1861
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:05,810
Oh, shoot!

1862
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:09,750
Do I go up?

1863
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:10,930
Or through here?

1864
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:17,370
Oh,

1865
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:24,060
okay.

1866
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,840
I understand what I must do now.

1867
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,980
Oh, he spat it out.

1868
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,380
Then he spat it out.

1869
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,660
Oh, he just keeps... they just keep grabbing that guy.

1870
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,860
Oh my god, this is messed up.

1871
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:39,900
Wait, this is so messed up!

1872
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,180
Wait, okay, hold on.

1873
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,380
I gotta push these somehow.

1874
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,540
Okay, push you.

1875
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,960
And then we'll blow them up.

1876
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,060
Okay, wait.

1877
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,840
Oh, they're so lightweight.

1878
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,860
Okay, someone will grab it.

1879
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,500
That one, right there, going down.

1880
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,280
Going in for the kill!

1881
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,540
Oops, now my depth reception is a little off.

1882
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,640
Okay, one more.

1883
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,620
It dodged every single one.

1884
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,060
It dodged every single one.

1885
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:43,680
Here we go.

1886
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,130
Um, that should be good enough.

1887
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:53,490
Oh.

1888
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,270
Good enough.

1889
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,650
Maybe.

1890
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,490
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1891
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,280
Okay, maybe not good enough.

1892
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,740
Wait, what's reload?

1893
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,200
Um, what's...

1894
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:19,490
Hey, buddy.

1895
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:22,810
I don't need to reload.

1896
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,230
We'll just send every...

1897
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:26,450
I can't pick up that guy one on.

1898
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:29,770
Run.

1899
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,430
That was close.

1900
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:40,530
Oh, sorry.

1901
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:42,230
I didn't mean reload like the gun.

1902
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,570
Sorry.

1903
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,650
I'm gonna reload my save.

1904
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:45,370
But thank you.

1905
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:46,590
I really appreciate it.

1906
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:50,010
Oh, that was my... That was my wording.

1907
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:53,670
Oh, shoot.

1908
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:54,910
Oh my God.

1909
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:55,570
Oh my God.

1910
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:01,130
Okay, but I need you to blow this up, maybe.

1911
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,110
Ouch.

1912
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:02,670
Ouch.

1913
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:02,970
Ouch.

1914
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:04,110
Okay, don't blow it up.

1915
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,890
Oh my God.

1916
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,630
I need to run.

1917
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:06,950
And...

1918
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:07,050
Jump.

1919
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,290
Oh, I missed.

1920
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:08,890
Oh.

1921
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:11,130
Please.

1922
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,150
I have no stamina.

1923
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:19,710
Wait.

1924
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,750
There's... There's a ladder.

1925
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:23,370
I see it.

1926
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,010
We're fine.

1927
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:25,670
Everything's good.

1928
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:26,390
Everybody.

1929
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:27,790
Don't panic.

1930
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:33,610
We're not panicking.

1931
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,070
Oh my God.

1932
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:39,330
No.

1933
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:40,030
Dead man.

1934
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:41,670
Man down, man.

1935
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:45,910
We're not panicking.

1936
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:46,410
Right, everyone?

1937
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:53,810
Oh my God.

1938
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:54,090
Oh my God.

1939
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:54,270
I'm where?

1940
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:02,540
Scum.

1941
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,480
I don't know where that came from.

1942
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,200
Thank you.

1943
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,560
I'm stuck.

1944
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:09,320
Oh my God.

1945
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:11,460
Oh.

1946
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:12,600
Oh, I see it.

1947
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:20,850
Holy.

1948
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:20,950
Holy.

1949
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:24,170
We made it.

1950
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,420
Donkey Kong Ash level.

1951
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,080
Let's see.

1952
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:37,600
Over there.

1953
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:44,590
We'll get there, everybody.

1954
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:46,110
Okay, yeah.

1955
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:47,590
Oh, I need these.

1956
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:47,930
Okay.

1957
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,370
Oh, this is kind of fun.

1958
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:50,710
Wait.

1959
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,870
Okay, we'll put that there for now.

1960
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:58,010
You're a surprise, y'all.

1961
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:01,270
Okay.

1962
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:04,530
I picked them up like they're nothing though.

1963
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:06,250
My realism.

1964
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:07,970
Flip.

1965
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:08,590
Oh.

1966
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,010
I did press space.

1967
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,030
I promise you.

1968
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:17,710
While water would make the explosions much worse, the water would absolutely slow the bullets down.

1969
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,770
Don't worry about it.

1970
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:22,530
The physics.

1971
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:35,920
And...

1972
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:40,750
Is it me?

1973
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:42,190
Am I...

1974
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:42,970
Is my timing wrong?

1975
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:48,170
Needs more bricks.

1976
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:49,790
Am I going down and I don't realize?

1977
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,280
Oh, this looks like a secret.

1978
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:07,320
Oh.

1979
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1980
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,020
We're safe.

1981
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:32,880
We're zooming.

1982
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,380
Oh shit, that's not an open door.

1983
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,350
Oh, that's evil.

1984
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:45,430
That's so evil.

1985
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:47,330
Oh my god.

1986
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:47,890
Please move.

1987
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:53,610
Thank you for the super job.

1988
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:54,410
Thank you for the pig.

1989
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:58,050
Zen wildlife has pretty much made Earth their home.

1990
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:58,570
Aw.

1991
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,150
Woof.

1992
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:05,470
She's too good.

1993
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:10,170
Don't I know it, baby?

1994
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:15,830
Intense.

1995
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:20,130
Let me know also if like the volume ever starts getting kind of funky, you know?

1996
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:28,440
Hold on.

1997
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:30,120
Maybe I won't mess this one up.

1998
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,460
What is that?

1999
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,380
Is that a person?

2000
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:37,680
Is that an enemy?

2001
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,200
When it's like right here.

2002
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:49,880
Dang it.

2003
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:50,960
Still not.

2004
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,220
Maybe I can't get closer because I think I'm going to fall.

2005
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,000
It's like a trap.

2006
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,360
Dying.

2007
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,000
Don't shoot?

2008
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:06,940
Just let it eat it.

2009
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:07,540
Oh, does that work?

2010
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,240
Oh, it did work.

2011
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,280
Oh yeah, because they're shorter.

2012
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:11,520
Okay.

2013
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,320
I thought that they would disappear, the lines.

2014
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,360
Okay, so we have...

2015
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:19,060
Down here...

2016
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,320
I could go to...

2017
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,480
Which if I do go down, I don't know how to get back up.

2018
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,780
So I don't want to go down just yet.

2019
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,520
And we have this...

2020
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,120
Really crispy guy!

2021
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,020
Holy!

2022
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,300
There is a ladder?

2023
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,440
Did I miss it?

2024
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,140
I don't know why I'm so...

2025
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:53,100
I'm extremely blind with this game, you guys.

2026
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,180
Holy cannoli.

2027
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,220
Oh, it's a symbol!

2028
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,180
I thought it was a...

2029
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,480
I thought it was a...

2030
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,080
What's the word?

2031
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,500
A little wheel you turn.

2032
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,040
I'm really blind today!

2033
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,360
What's wrong with me?

2034
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,540
Aw, sorry mister.

2035
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,420
Yeah, Valve!

2036
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,910
This is why I don't do stream so early.

2037
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:26,470
Crispy.

2038
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:27,770
I'm just too stupid.

2039
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:30,690
I'm too stu...

2040
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:31,770
I'm too tired to think.

2041
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:45,450
Crispy.

2042
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,850
Holy crispy.

2043
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:52,830
I think I need this though.

2044
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:54,550
For the other ones.

2045
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:01,670
Crispy bacon.

2046
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:04,030
He's our man.

2047
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,030
But there's more.

2048
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:12,550
Or...

2049
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:13,850
There were more?

2050
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,390
Did they all die?

2051
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:17,950
No, I see it.

2052
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:18,830
Yeah, there we go.

2053
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:20,630
Okay, so I'm just gonna let it eat it.

2054
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:22,730
And see what happens.

2055
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:41,310
You sons of bitches.

2056
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:44,450
Sons of bitches!

2057
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:46,030
Chat!

2058
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:49,490
Okay.

2059
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:50,310
Go up.

2060
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:52,490
Wait, I see another one.

2061
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:59,220
Oh, there's some physics happening.

2062
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,220
Oh, they're shooting at me.

2063
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,180
There's not physics at all.

2064
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:07,330
Oh, they are aiming at me.

2065
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:07,950
At the moment.

2066
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:09,550
Okay, anyway.

2067
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:11,250
Ignore them.

2068
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:13,230
Ignore them.

2069
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:17,070
Another crispy person.

2070
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:21,110
So many crispy people around here.

2071
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:24,230
Okay, so this one we can...

2072
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:26,570
This one...

2073
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:30,750
We can throw and let the first guys eat.

2074
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:32,210
And I will blow it up.

2075
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,080
Ow, did that hurt me too?

2076
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,640
I think it did actually.

2077
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,420
Oh, wait.

2078
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,780
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

2079
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:49,460
Okay.

2080
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,000
Good, good stuff, good stuff.

2081
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,740
Good stuff.

2082
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:52,540
Alright, good stuff, good stuff.

2083
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,520
Ugh.

2084
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,340
Now, I run.

2085
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,880
Alright, well, I just saved, so...

2086
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:26,760
Um...

2087
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,140
Guys, do I go left?

2088
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:29,440
Or right?

2089
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:30,000
Let's go left.

2090
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:35,600
Crispy.

2091
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:36,980
Crispy.

2092
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:38,180
Crispy.

2093
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,860
This is not...

2094
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:42,080
Ammo?

2095
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:42,760
Give me?

2096
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,560
I'm full.

2097
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,560
Ugh.

2098
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:47,900
Scared me.

2099
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,020
Place seems haunted.

2100
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,440
No secret behind the door.

2101
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,760
Recently booked a trip to Japan.

2102
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,000
What the?

2103
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,020
See, dudes...

2104
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:12,020
Since it'll be your first time.

2105
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,120
Um...

2106
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,100
Oh gosh.

2107
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:15,700
Nothing...

2108
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,280
Nothing...

2109
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:17,800
Uh...

2110
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,080
Just...

2111
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:18,500
Just...

2112
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,380
Go do whatever you want.

2113
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,320
Uh...

2114
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,280
Just have a good time.

2115
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,360
If you wanna go do something, go check it out.

2116
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,480
Ugh.

2117
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:27,960
Sorry.

2118
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:28,860
My brain is...

2119
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,520
My brain cannot really answer because I am...

2120
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,080
I am on overload right now.

2121
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,560
Hahaha.

2122
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,320
I apologize for the non-answer.

2123
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,700
Anything?

2124
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:51,540
Anything?

2125
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,220
Are we almost there?

2126
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:06,880
To the lab?

2127
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,360
Please.

2128
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,020
Uh...

2129
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:11,440
Get off your turn.

2130
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,300
Civil protection is onto us.

2131
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,620
We're tearing down the railroad.

2132
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:15,500
Covering our tracks.

2133
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:16,980
Oh.

2134
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,760
Looks like you're gonna be the last one through.

2135
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,560
I'm sorry, I'm just...

2136
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,320
You're glad you're not the guy they're looking for.

2137
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:24,380
Poor bastard doesn't stand a chance.

2138
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:24,920
Oh, yeah.

2139
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,860
Yeah, poor him, right?

2140
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:34,720
Uh-oh.

2141
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,360
This is a man hack?

2142
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:54,620
You're welcome.

2143
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,160
Don't put that down.

2144
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:03,860
Man hack.

2145
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:07,800
You don't like me.

2146
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,540
Where's the supplies?

2147
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:10,720
Give me anything?

2148
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,240
Give me something.

2149
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,580
I saved your life.

2150
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,020
Saved your life, mister.

2151
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:21,140
What's better against those guns or...

2152
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:23,000
The crowbar.

2153
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:25,740
Up on top.

2154
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,120
Get up there.

2155
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:30,560
Mister.

2156
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,460
Mister, why you gotta make it so difficult for me, huh?

2157
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:38,960
Use your arms.

2158
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,420
Use your arms, Gordon Freeman.

2159
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:42,860
Reach.

2160
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,880
Reach for the sky.

2161
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:47,940
Wait, I'm trying to just see what else is up here.

2162
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,940
Reach for the sky.

2163
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,960
I don't know how to turn things.

2164
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,920
I know how to pick them up, but I don't know how to turn them.

2165
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:03,570
Okay, I think...

2166
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:04,650
I don't see anything else.

2167
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:05,710
I think we're good.

2168
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:06,050
Okay.

2169
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:07,670
See you later, mister.

2170
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:11,370
You go on.

2171
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:14,370
Shut the hell up.

2172
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,700
He's got a nice little setup up here, right?

2173
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,240
Okay, mister.

2174
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:28,440
Hold on.

2175
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,240
Let me just take your staff.

2176
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:33,750
Oops.

2177
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:35,090
My bad.

2178
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:42,520
Thank you.

2179
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,180
Aw, you're so nice.

2180
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:58,290
They'll break open the door for me.

2181
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,200
Come on in!

2182
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,280
Hello?

2183
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:28,700
Where is he?

2184
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:30,960
I didn't hear him scream.

2185
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:31,460
Is he okay?

2186
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,220
No!

2187
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:39,360
Did they get him?

2188
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,480
That's so messed up!

2189
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,160
My god!

2190
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:53,260
Okay, but he didn't tell me where the ladder was.

2191
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,040
So, also...

2192
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,760
Feeling a little bit vindicated.

2193
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,020
Holy cow.

2194
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,520
That doesn't seem good.

2195
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,630
Taking one step at a time.

2196
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:34,470
Anybody in here?

2197
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:35,350
No?

2198
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:37,010
Okay.

2199
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:39,210
Hmm...

2200
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:44,540
Guys...

2201
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:46,140
Outside is so scary.

2202
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,560
That's what I'm learning from this game.

2203
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,320
I'm in here.

2204
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,220
Are you one of the crispy guys?

2205
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,020
Oh, I thought that was...

2206
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:57,300
Okay.

2207
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,620
I think I just need to get to the other side.

2208
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,700
I just gotta be fast about it.

2209
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:04,700
I don't wanna go outside.

2210
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:15,340
What is that?

2211
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:16,480
What is that?

2212
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:20,140
I think I hear...

2213
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:22,100
Some...

2214
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,120
I hear one of them, I think.

2215
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:36,100
What's that on the ceiling?

2216
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:37,720
Oh.

2217
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,660
I think it's pipes.

2218
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:43,060
It's a vent.

2219
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,180
The vent has goodies.

2220
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,220
Do they always like...

2221
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:55,040
Oh my goodness.

2222
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:56,360
Oh!

2223
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:57,800
Goodies you say!

2224
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:58,380
Oh!

2225
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,060
I see!

2226
01:42:59,320 --> 01:42:59,760
I see!

2227
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,060
You are all tricksters.

2228
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,580
What?

2229
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,300
Oh, does this door not open?

2230
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:17,480
Okay.

2231
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:21,840
I see!

2232
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:24,320
Little tricksters you all are!

2233
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:26,260
Okay.

2234
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:28,420
What a strange layout.

2235
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:29,600
Oh!

2236
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:29,960
Oh!

2237
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,780
I wonder when I'll get something other than a pistol.

2238
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,320
Oh my god!

2239
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:40,980
Oh my god!

2240
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,610
Okay, good.

2241
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:52,210
I saw some of you being so rude in the chat and yelling.

2242
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:53,630
Don't shoot it three times!

2243
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:54,990
Only shoot it two!

2244
01:43:54,990 --> 01:43:58,030
But if I shoot it three times and it explodes immediately.

2245
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:10,870
Chat backseating.

2246
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:11,470
Yeah.

2247
01:44:12,990 --> 01:44:13,610
Okay.

2248
01:44:13,950 --> 01:44:15,130
Here we go.

2249
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:22,620
Oh my god.

2250
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,120
I can't aim for shit.

2251
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,900
Happened already!

2252
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:39,640
How exciting!

2253
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:46,390
It's not even the same number for this one.

2254
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:48,930
I already got a new gun!

2255
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:52,810
Fancy that.

2256
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:54,950
Hello, mister.

2257
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:56,650
This was such a good hiding...

2258
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:57,710
Ah!

2259
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:58,330
Ah!

2260
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,290
Shut up.

2261
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:07,990
Oh my god, not my flashlight.

2262
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:08,370
Ah!

2263
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:08,850
Ah!

2264
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:17,990
Lady Saffron, thank you so much for the...

2265
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:19,930
For the...

2266
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:22,070
For the...

2267
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:22,570
For the rain, thank you!

2268
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:26,480
My flashlight went out.

2269
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:28,020
Gross!

2270
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:28,780
Oh gross!

2271
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:30,020
Wait, I got grenades!

2272
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:32,500
Okay.

2273
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,400
One, two...

2274
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:36,380
My SMG.

2275
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,700
Wait, five is the grenade.

2276
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:40,200
Okay.

2277
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,300
Oh sh...

2278
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,360
Why did I do that?

2279
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,820
I didn't realize...

2280
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:47,040
Wait.

2281
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:48,320
I clicked three though!

2282
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:53,140
Did I just lose my grenade?

2283
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,480
I just lost the grenade.

2284
01:45:57,980 --> 01:45:58,700
Oops.

2285
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,440
Look at more guys!

2286
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,160
It's fine!

2287
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:11,940
Look at more!

2288
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,940
Oh, this sucks a little...

2289
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:24,740
Um...

2290
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:31,540
Did I go under?

2291
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:32,200
Over?

2292
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,120
What is breaking?

2293
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:38,040
Oh, I see, I see.

2294
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,500
It's like one of those...

2295
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:41,020
Hotel...

2296
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:41,460
You know?

2297
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,160
Through...

2298
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:45,540
Where?

2299
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:45,840
There...

2300
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:48,640
Um...

2301
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:49,300
Is there a hole?

2302
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:50,200
I...

2303
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,420
I think I'm too fat to go through there.

2304
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:56,380
Yeah, one of those hotel doors...

2305
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:56,520
You know?

2306
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,540
That always spin around...

2307
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:01,360
I always would get so excited for those as a kid.

2308
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:03,260
Is there a ladder that I'm missing?

2309
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:04,160
There wouldn't be...

2310
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,220
Cause there's nowhere to go out.

2311
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,880
Do I spin on top of you?

2312
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:17,370
Keep looking, you'll find it.

2313
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:18,090
A key!

2314
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:19,310
I trust!

2315
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:41,580
I found.

2316
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:45,900
Wait, which way did I come from?

2317
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:56,860
We did!

2318
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,340
We managed to avoid drowning.

2319
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:16,500
Little bastard.

2320
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:21,220
My eyes.

2321
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:22,960
I know, I hate this thing the most.

2322
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:23,920
It's so horrible.

2323
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,980
So how's the volume, you guys?

2324
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:27,660
I know...

2325
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:30,520
I think I asked before and then I...

2326
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:41,010
I'm gonna go back to our pistol.

2327
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:42,990
Is it okay?

2328
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:44,430
Is it loud?

2329
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:47,210
I think it's gonna be loud cause I'm shooting guns.

2330
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:48,010
So I apologize.

2331
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:52,610
Beep, beep.

2332
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:58,820
I'm just gonna shoot him.

2333
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,180
Come on.

2334
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,160
That's right.

2335
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:03,600
Ugly.

2336
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,160
I want to look out there.

2337
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,240
Wait.

2338
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:11,060
Wait.

2339
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:11,400
Go.

2340
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:12,920
Oh wait.

2341
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,100
I think I have to go out there.

2342
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:14,620
Just kidding.

2343
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:16,760
Game tricked me.

2344
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:25,440
Oh shoot.

2345
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,640
Did you just throw a grenade?

2346
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,440
No, she threw a...

2347
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,340
One of these.

2348
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:33,540
Can I...

2349
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:34,400
Oh, I was gonna say...

2350
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,680
I don't think I can get over here, dummy.

2351
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:40,840
Your man hacker.

2352
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:42,000
Wait.

2353
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,120
Okay, from here...

2354
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:44,700
Do I need to...

2355
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:45,020
Aha!

2356
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,820
I see, I see, I see!

2357
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:50,760
I understood the assignment.

2358
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:51,700
Oh!

2359
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:53,660
Oh my gosh.

2360
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:53,920
Wait.

2361
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:55,640
Um...

2362
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:58,020
Um...

2363
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:03,410
What is that?

2364
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:04,170
Flying over there.

2365
01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:17,190
I like the way they try to chew it.

2366
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:18,410
They're just like, disgusting.

2367
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:20,550
Disgusting.

2368
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,610
Disgusting.

2369
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:23,630
Okay, I think I can blow them up with a...

2370
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:24,730
If I give them one of these.

2371
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:26,050
Wait.

2372
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:26,930
Wait!

2373
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,500
Oh!

2374
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,360
Uh...

2375
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:31,580
Sure.

2376
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:39,800
Guys!

2377
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,700
Some very needed...

2378
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:48,560
Everything.

2379
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,520
Good job, team.

2380
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:52,240
Good job, team.

2381
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:59,700
I'm gonna bring this guy out.

2382
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:00,340
Just in case.

2383
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:01,180
Okay, I'm...

2384
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:03,080
Guessing I can't get hit by this team.

2385
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,700
Or else it...

2386
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:06,000
Hoorts me.

2387
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:08,720
And that guy's waiting for me.

2388
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:11,960
Look at him!

2389
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,200
Stalking me!

2390
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,120
Let me go, thank you!

2391
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,020
I'm watching you!

2392
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:24,760
I'm watching you!

2393
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,220
I'm watching you!

2394
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,240
And he's watching me.

2395
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,120
And I'm watching him.

2396
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:31,300
He's even...

2397
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:34,000
This is serious.

2398
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:40,090
I could shoot it.

2399
01:51:40,210 --> 01:51:40,770
That is true.

2400
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:01,800
Oh, there it is.

2401
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:04,580
Oh!

2402
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:05,220
Oh!

2403
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:05,920
Oh!

2404
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:14,640
Why are you so mean?

2405
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:15,720
What are you talking about?

2406
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:16,880
He wants to...

2407
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,520
He wants to peel me like an apple!

2408
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:20,800
Whatever.

2409
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:27,140
Oh, wait.

2410
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,780
Now I'm inside the room, aren't I?

2411
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,180
I sure hope he doesn't notice.

2412
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:34,140
Find all Lambda caches in Half-Life 2.

2413
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:39,160
What does that mean?

2414
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:41,160
When I'm doing that.

2415
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,500
Justice for manhack!

2416
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,400
What about me?

2417
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:54,500
The symbols.

2418
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,300
I don't even see where I found it.

2419
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:02,650
Like, I see this guy, but...

2420
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:04,230
Ah, here we go.

2421
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:05,430
That's tricky.

2422
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:09,350
In we go!

2423
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:09,370
Oh!

2424
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:16,300
Aha!

2425
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,900
I should get my gun out.

2426
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:22,540
And...

2427
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:24,860
Oh my god.

2428
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:25,300
Oh my god.

2429
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:25,640
Oh my god.

2430
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:25,960
Oh my god.

2431
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:26,260
Oh my god.

2432
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:26,540
Oh my god.

2433
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:26,980
Just run!

2434
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:33,060
Just run!

2435
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:34,240
Ow!

2436
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:35,880
Oh!

2437
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:40,100
Oh my god, they can hit me!

2438
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:40,700
They can hit me!

2439
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:41,240
They can hit me!

2440
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:41,680
They can hit me!

2441
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:42,120
They can hit me!

2442
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:43,520
They can hit me!

2443
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:49,630
Oh gosh!

2444
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:55,510
Oh my god.

2445
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:56,230
Oh my god.

2446
01:53:56,350 --> 01:53:56,570
Please.

2447
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:10,180
Oh my gosh.

2448
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,540
Are they just gonna keep coming in?

2449
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:18,580
Or... wait, can I... towards, you know, the very obvious light that's right next to me.

2450
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:25,180
And then, this is a... there's this.

2451
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:56,360
I'm just gonna sit in a corner and let them come to me!

2452
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:11,700
Yeah, I see... I see the very problematic, um... reason not to shoot in this room.

2453
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,100
I understand.

2454
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:16,440
Very much.

2455
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:22,940
Come at me.

2456
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:25,880
Okay.

2457
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,840
I imagine... that is it.

2458
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:32,580
For now.

2459
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:33,480
Okay.

2460
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:39,750
Golly.

2461
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:43,310
Okay.

2462
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:44,270
There's something up there.

2463
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:50,050
But...

2464
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:53,630
It's not where I came from.

2465
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:54,650
Hmm.

2466
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:56,950
I don't think I can get up there.

2467
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:00,650
Shoot the barrels!

2468
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:01,890
Okay!

2469
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:23,220
Wait, if I just use the barrels here...

2470
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:26,160
If I could somehow stack them...

2471
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,260
I wish I could rotate them.

2472
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:27,900
Oh, here we go.

2473
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,300
I have to rotate them...

2474
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:31,540
Very...

2475
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:32,700
Carefully.

2476
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,260
Like...

2477
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:39,580
Too early?

2478
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:46,310
Actually...

2479
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:48,510
Maybe it'll work.

2480
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:53,380
Nevermind.

2481
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,140
It don't...

2482
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:55,620
It doesn't.

2483
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:59,480
I'm overthinking it, am I?

2484
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,840
That's me.

2485
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,200
Minky the overthinker.

2486
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:07,280
I could just stack these guys.

2487
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,260
How do I get up there?

2488
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,760
I have to keep stacking them.

2489
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:20,530
Explodes barrel.

2490
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:21,750
But please respond!

2491
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:22,690
Answer me!

2492
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:24,050
Minky!

2493
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:31,260
Her massive brain is wearing her down!

2494
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:33,580
How so?

2495
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:35,540
What am I doing?

2496
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,060
Oopsie.

2497
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,800
What about the ladder?

2498
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:43,860
I don't think it goes up to anywhere unless I like...

2499
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,520
Unless I jump onto the pipes.

2500
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:56,800
No, I don't want to go down.

2501
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:58,180
I want to see what's over there.

2502
01:57:58,760 --> 01:57:59,300
That's all.

2503
01:57:59,500 --> 01:57:59,940
I know...

2504
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,880
I feel like I need to go down, but I don't want to go down just yet.

2505
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:03,480
Is what I'm saying.

2506
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:08,980
Oh, there we go!

2507
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:16,000
I just want to see what's over here.

2508
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,840
I like to explore, everybody.

2509
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:22,280
Sorry if that annoys you.

2510
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:26,920
It's how I play game.

2511
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,240
I like walking everywhere and seeing everything.

2512
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,840
It's how I like to do.

2513
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:40,000
Actually, I don't know which way was supposed to be the correct way anymore.

2514
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:41,560
Wait.

2515
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:46,200
I hate the ladder so much.

2516
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:49,220
Like, I know it's E to dismount, but I just don't get it right.

2517
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:49,960
Ah!

2518
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,400
This is...

2519
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,180
Okay, okay, okay.

2520
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:58,940
So we're basically just on the other side of where we were going to go.

2521
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:00,860
Minky Dog Explorer.

2522
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:09,580
Sorry, Stretch.

2523
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:14,890
Let's see.

2524
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:17,950
What do we got going on in this room?

2525
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:23,610
I guess we can go see what is on the other side as well.

2526
01:59:26,510 --> 01:59:27,030
Ah!

2527
01:59:27,530 --> 01:59:28,070
Thank you.

2528
01:59:29,290 --> 01:59:30,350
Thank you, Box.

2529
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:34,010
Ladder.

2530
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:34,690
Water through.

2531
01:59:35,090 --> 01:59:35,290
Wait.

2532
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:37,250
No, that's just shadows.

2533
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:39,230
I thought this might be like a...

2534
01:59:39,230 --> 01:59:41,050
A hole to crawl through.

2535
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:43,790
Okay, so we checked over here.

2536
01:59:49,580 --> 01:59:50,680
Now we go down.

2537
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:07,330
How am I supposed to get in here though?

2538
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:11,770
Hmm, curious.

2539
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:15,390
Papers, thank you so much for the five gift.

2540
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:16,130
Thank you!

2541
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,590
Oh.

2542
02:00:18,810 --> 02:00:19,150
Oh.

2543
02:00:19,370 --> 02:00:19,950
Oh, come on.

2544
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:21,410
No, please don't do this to me.

2545
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:22,790
Wait.

2546
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:25,370
Who sabotaged the ladder?

2547
02:00:25,670 --> 02:00:26,530
Wait, please.

2548
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:28,010
Oh my God.

2549
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:28,330
Wait.

2550
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:30,750
Okay.

2551
02:00:31,650 --> 02:00:32,230
We're fine.

2552
02:00:38,930 --> 02:00:40,230
What the heck?

2553
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:42,030
So funny.

2554
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:47,730
Okay, I think everything that we need to do is over on this side then.

2555
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:51,410
But what?

2556
02:00:53,770 --> 02:00:54,290
Oh.

2557
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:55,870
Oh my goodness, guys.

2558
02:00:58,410 --> 02:01:02,730
I don't know why I've been having such bad headaches recently.

2559
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:08,370
Oh, give me one second.

2560
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:17,060
Hmm.

2561
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:20,360
NYC debuff.

2562
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:22,200
I came back from New York and...

2563
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:22,720
Gosh.

2564
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:24,020
It messed me up.

2565
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:25,580
Is that me?

2566
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:27,800
Um...

2567
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,360
I was fine until just now.

2568
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,200
It all just...

2569
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,040
It just came...

2570
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:31,600
At once.

2571
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,080
Um...

2572
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:37,080
Uh...

2573
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:37,720
Pipes.

2574
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,180
Anything with the pipes.

2575
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,380
The pipes.

2576
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:42,220
The pipes.

2577
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:43,600
Why does it gotta be pipes?

2578
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:47,890
Um...

2579
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:48,980
Oh!

2580
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,020
There's more health down there.

2581
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:56,640
Break time?

2582
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:57,480
I'm...

2583
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:00,060
Um...

2584
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,500
I might go get...

2585
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:02,400
Some medicine.

2586
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,060
It's...

2587
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:03,720
Right...

2588
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,300
Right behind my eye.

2589
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,760
Where it's like...

2590
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,620
Just a surge of spiritual energy.

2591
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:12,360
She fulfilled the prophecy.

2592
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:14,000
She escaped from New York.

2593
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:17,580
It's true!

2594
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:26,050
If you get those kinds of headaches, you know they're like...

2595
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:27,370
They're such a pain.

2596
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:33,760
Um...

2597
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:36,810
Uh...

2598
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:37,450
Uh...

2599
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,560
Uh...

2600
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:47,560
Saw your ghost migraine and wanted to try...

2601
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:49,500
Cap...

2602
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:50,740
Oh...

2603
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:52,300
Um...

2604
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:53,200
Yeah, I've...

2605
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:53,660
I...

2606
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:54,660
Have had...

2607
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:55,800
Migraines...

2608
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,020
For as long as I've been dead.

2609
02:02:58,540 --> 02:02:58,900
So...

2610
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:00,260
Um...

2611
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:01,880
Only a couple things work for me.

2612
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:03,600
Um...

2613
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:04,960
But I appreciate it.

2614
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:05,580
That...

2615
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:05,720
Uh...

2616
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:07,080
People that try to help...

2617
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:07,940
Out and everything.

2618
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,600
Only a couple things...

2619
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,480
Really work for me.

2620
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:12,940
So...

2621
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:13,600
Since I've...

2622
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:14,800
I've had them...

2623
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:16,360
For a long, long time!

2624
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:17,480
Hehehehe.

2625
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:18,740
It's all good though.

2626
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,260
Imagine it as your latent psychic powers.

2627
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:24,920
I'm...

2628
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,220
Do I...

2629
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:26,840
I don't think I can be psychic.

2630
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:27,580
I'm a ghost.

2631
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:29,100
Hehehehe.

2632
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:31,660
Hmm...

2633
02:03:32,190 --> 02:03:32,400
But...

2634
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,320
I appreciate it.

2635
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,540
I appreciate it when people are like...

2636
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:35,720
Oh, maybe try this, try that.

2637
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:37,580
I've tried a lot, a lot of things.

2638
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:39,920
And um...

2639
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,460
You know, I kinda know what works for me.

2640
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,980
And how I am able to...

2641
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:43,400
Ah!

2642
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,700
How I am able to handle them now.

2643
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:46,040
You know?

2644
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:47,260
So...

2645
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:51,780
There we goooood!

2646
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:58,630
Oh, we're still going.

2647
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,330
Okay.

2648
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:00,790
There we keep going.

2649
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:01,390
Okay.

2650
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:02,210
Alright.

2651
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:03,750
Here we are.

2652
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:04,370
Still going.

2653
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:05,330
Hehehehe.

2654
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:08,570
Is there another one?

2655
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:10,370
Nope, it's still going.

2656
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:16,020
Uh...

2657
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:19,200
But this just...

2658
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:23,420
Oh wait!

2659
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:24,360
But it probably...

2660
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:25,920
Oh, it raised it in the other room too then.

2661
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:26,720
Yahoo!

2662
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:27,460
Okay.

2663
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:29,500
Oh, now I'm stuck.

2664
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:30,740
Hehehehe.

2665
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:34,000
Have you tried removing your brain?

2666
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:35,560
Putting it in the dishwasher.

2667
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:37,540
Do you have a brain?

2668
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:40,000
You have a brain to remove?

2669
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:42,320
Uh oh.

2670
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,200
I knew it.

2671
02:04:43,340 --> 02:04:43,820
I heard them.

2672
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,580
I heard you!

2673
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,460
I heard you!

2674
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:51,440
Yeah!

2675
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:52,900
Oh!

2676
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:54,100
Wasn't me.

2677
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:54,680
Wasn't me.

2678
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,260
Wasn't me.

2679
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:55,920
Wasn't me.

2680
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:56,400
Wasn't me.

2681
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:56,660
Wasn't me.

2682
02:04:56,860 --> 02:04:56,880
Wasn't me.

2683
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:57,180
Wasn't me!

2684
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,700
I think someone shot...

2685
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:01,820
In the room.

2686
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:06,620
I have a sneaking suspicion that somebody...

2687
02:05:06,620 --> 02:05:07,640
Shot a gun.

2688
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:09,800
Or...

2689
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,760
The man hacks.

2690
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:13,380
Oh!

2691
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,300
They're all gone!

2692
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,480
Oh, the barrels are gone!

2693
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:18,240
Let's go.

2694
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:20,020
Hehehehe.

2695
02:05:21,740 --> 02:05:23,560
I didn't even have to lift a finger.

2696
02:05:29,870 --> 02:05:30,790
The real...

2697
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:30,990
Oh!

2698
02:05:31,210 --> 02:05:31,370
Wait.

2699
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:33,290
No!

2700
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:33,910
I go down.

2701
02:05:34,150 --> 02:05:34,670
Sorry, my bad.

2702
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:35,050
I forgot.

2703
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:37,470
Real princess treatment over here.

2704
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:37,930
Hehehe.

2705
02:05:38,610 --> 02:05:39,450
Get away!

2706
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:39,830
Get away!

2707
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:46,160
What is that?

2708
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:47,700
Oh, just a red light.

2709
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:47,960
Okay.

2710
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:52,210
Alright.

2711
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:54,230
Anything down here?

2712
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:55,650
Some boxes?

2713
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:56,890
Maybe with some loot?

2714
02:05:59,870 --> 02:06:00,390
Oh.

2715
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:03,310
Hold on.

2716
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:05,030
I don't want my oxygen to run out.

2717
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:06,610
Oh gosh!

2718
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:07,170
Oh gosh!

2719
02:06:07,290 --> 02:06:07,750
Oh my gosh!

2720
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:10,250
That does a lot of damage!

2721
02:06:10,910 --> 02:06:11,930
Holy damage!

2722
02:06:12,230 --> 02:06:12,670
Wow!

2723
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:12,870
Wow!

2724
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:14,470
Okay, but it goes back up.

2725
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:15,190
Okay, good, good, good.

2726
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,830
Goodness!

2727
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:25,190
Wait.

2728
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:26,490
Maybe if I...

2729
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:27,010
Let it...

2730
02:06:27,010 --> 02:06:27,550
Okay, it's...

2731
02:06:27,550 --> 02:06:28,370
Dang it, it doesn't float.

2732
02:06:31,230 --> 02:06:33,650
I thought it said we all float down here.

2733
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:34,690
What happened?

2734
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:38,190
Okay.

2735
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:40,110
Yeah, it's temporary damage.

2736
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:40,730
That's nice.

2737
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:44,630
Okay.

2738
02:06:45,190 --> 02:06:46,290
We all floatin'.

2739
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:49,230
We all floatin'.

2740
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:51,730
I'm floatin', I'm floatin'.

2741
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:52,030
Cool.

2742
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:53,490
Wait, wait.

2743
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:55,070
Wait, wait.

2744
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:55,930
Uh, uh.

2745
02:06:56,730 --> 02:06:57,450
Why am I sinking?

2746
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:03,340
Uh, uh, please.

2747
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:04,720
And I...

2748
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,220
Jump.

2749
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:06,920
Jump?

2750
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:07,620
Hello?

2751
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:07,780
Oh?

2752
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:14,210
I'll float on.

2753
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:14,970
Alright.

2754
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:16,630
I'll...

2755
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,450
I'll float on.

2756
02:07:19,070 --> 02:07:19,270
B...

2757
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:24,450
How'd you jump this situation?

2758
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:24,850
Oh.

2759
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:26,050
Why am I not floating?

2760
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:30,380
Duck jump.

2761
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:31,820
Hey!

2762
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:32,920
Oh!

2763
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:42,550
We did a team!

2764
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:46,370
We did it!

2765
02:07:49,710 --> 02:07:50,650
Do

2766
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:02,880
I have my gun out or what?

2767
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:07,570
Nothing here.

2768
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,140
Oh my gosh.

2769
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:21,660
Gosh!

2770
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:25,260
You son of a bitch.

2771
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:31,600
Now all of China knows you're here.

2772
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,520
Which way do I go, though?

2773
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:37,760
I think I fall onto that.

2774
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:40,480
Wait, does the water break my fall like in Minecraft?

2775
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,520
Or... Is that not a thing?

2776
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:44,340
Oh shoot.

2777
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:45,080
Oh shoot.

2778
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:00,970
Oh my gosh!

2779
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:06,260
We got him.

2780
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:13,510
Oh, don't alert the guards, please.

2781
02:09:18,170 --> 02:09:18,570
Please.

2782
02:09:23,210 --> 02:09:24,010
Oh, wait.

2783
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:29,410
Is this the gun where if I press right click, it shoots like the grenade?

2784
02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:31,410
I see the alt on the bottom.

2785
02:09:31,610 --> 02:09:33,250
Sorry that I'm... Hold on, guys.

2786
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:34,430
I'm so sorry.

2787
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:38,170
I think I'm gonna have to go get some headache medicine real quick.

2788
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:39,530
Random tips.

2789
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:42,630
Small marked boxes will be the only boxes with supplies.

2790
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:44,210
You'll have to get used to seeing them.

2791
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:44,670
Oh, okay.

2792
02:09:45,150 --> 02:09:47,450
Headcrabs and barnacles will die in one hit with a crowbar.

2793
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:49,470
Really?

2794
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:51,770
We don't go to Ravenholm.

2795
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:54,670
I don't know what that means, but...

2796
02:09:55,690 --> 02:09:56,170
Oh!

2797
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:57,370
I'm so sorry.

2798
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,090
Let me go.

2799
02:09:58,210 --> 02:10:03,070
I just... I think I can just take one and I'll be okay.

2800
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:05,750
I'll just... Sorry.

2801
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:08,790
I'm like... I'm... I'm... I'm winking at you guys.

2802
02:10:09,650 --> 02:10:10,130
Ow!

2803
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:10,990
Ow!

2804
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:13,410
Okay, I'll be right... I'm sorry.

2805
02:10:13,490 --> 02:10:14,130
I'll be right back.

2806
02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:15,490
Hey,

2807
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:56,110
I'm back.

2808
02:11:56,290 --> 02:11:57,050
Sorry about that.

2809
02:11:57,950 --> 02:12:00,610
Little... Little intermission we shall have.

2810
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:04,370
I got medicine, which I will take when my tea cools down a bit.

2811
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:06,550
And I've got Cheez-Its!

2812
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:08,970
Cheez-Its!

2813
02:12:09,150 --> 02:12:10,570
Cheez-Its as a snack.

2814
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:12,150
Yippee!

2815
02:12:13,150 --> 02:12:14,350
Too much thinking?

2816
02:12:15,010 --> 02:12:17,250
I... I think I know what it is.

2817
02:12:17,530 --> 02:12:18,450
I think.

2818
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:20,630
I think so.

2819
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:25,590
So...

2820
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:28,790
The flavor...

2821
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:30,110
Just regular old Cheez-Its.

2822
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:31,850
The original.

2823
02:12:34,030 --> 02:12:34,870
Mm-hmm.

2824
02:12:38,370 --> 02:12:39,290
So...

2825
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:41,050
Um...

2826
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:43,830
Um...

2827
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:45,370
Yeah, I think I know.

2828
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:46,650
It's all good.

2829
02:12:50,770 --> 02:12:54,770
Once a month, the bridge...

2830
02:12:54,770 --> 02:12:58,770
The gap from the spiritual world and the...

2831
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:04,770
And the human realm becomes very muddled.

2832
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:07,270
And so...

2833
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:07,930
Yeah.

2834
02:13:08,630 --> 02:13:10,010
Going through a very...

2835
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:10,730
You know, a...

2836
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:11,130
A...

2837
02:13:11,130 --> 02:13:11,710
A...

2838
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:12,190
A...

2839
02:13:12,910 --> 02:13:13,510
Tumultuously...

2840
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:16,090
A tumultuous spiritual time right now.

2841
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:17,290
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2842
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:18,330
Ha ha ha ha.

2843
02:13:18,970 --> 02:13:20,270
Oh my gosh, wait!

2844
02:13:20,590 --> 02:13:22,150
Did you guys know that there's...

2845
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:23,890
It's not a supermoon tonight.

2846
02:13:24,590 --> 02:13:25,190
But...

2847
02:13:25,190 --> 02:13:26,150
It's...

2848
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:26,590
Um...

2849
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:27,590
It's something else.

2850
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:29,150
It's a different kind of moon.

2851
02:13:30,070 --> 02:13:30,670
Where...

2852
02:13:30,670 --> 02:13:32,950
Because a supermoon is when, like, the gravitate...

2853
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:35,510
Where it's actually, like, close to Earth.

2854
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:38,730
But today...

2855
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:39,470
Um...

2856
02:13:39,470 --> 02:13:40,410
Oh, what was it?

2857
02:13:40,730 --> 02:13:40,950
Ugh.

2858
02:13:41,290 --> 02:13:41,750
It's...

2859
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:43,690
It's...

2860
02:13:44,210 --> 02:13:44,670
It's...

2861
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:44,690
It's...

2862
02:13:44,690 --> 02:13:46,650
But the moon will look really, really big.

2863
02:13:47,290 --> 02:13:49,070
So you guys should go look at it.

2864
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:50,110
Oh, yes!

2865
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:51,050
The sturgeon moon!

2866
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:52,410
It's the sturgeon moon!

2867
02:13:52,590 --> 02:13:53,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

2868
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:54,730
Ha ha ha ha!

2869
02:13:55,030 --> 02:13:56,250
You guys should...

2870
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:57,150
Check it out.

2871
02:13:57,250 --> 02:13:58,430
The sturgeon moon tonight.

2872
02:13:59,090 --> 02:13:59,550
Mm-hmm.

2873
02:14:01,330 --> 02:14:02,090
Ha ha ha.

2874
02:14:02,950 --> 02:14:03,510
It was...

2875
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,490
It was, uh...

2876
02:14:04,490 --> 02:14:06,510
Named that way from...

2877
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:07,350
Uh...

2878
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:10,290
I think it was, like, Native Americans named it that.

2879
02:14:10,510 --> 02:14:15,770
Because it always occurred during a time when, like, the sturgeon fish were...

2880
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:16,670
Were...

2881
02:14:16,670 --> 02:14:17,510
Were...

2882
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:18,450
Uh...

2883
02:14:18,450 --> 02:14:19,770
Reproducing and stuff.

2884
02:14:20,410 --> 02:14:20,970
So...

2885
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:21,270
Mm.

2886
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:23,810
Yeah.

2887
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:26,450
So...

2888
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:27,610
Check out the moon tonight.

2889
02:14:27,850 --> 02:14:28,810
It's not a supermoon.

2890
02:14:29,190 --> 02:14:31,030
Supermoon is when the moon is actually closer.

2891
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:31,410
Hold on.

2892
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:32,850
I'm gonna look it up, because I can't remember.

2893
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:34,530
Uh-oh.

2894
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:36,470
Stur...

2895
02:14:37,130 --> 02:14:38,150
Sturgeon moon.

2896
02:14:42,130 --> 02:14:43,230
Mm-mm-mm.

2897
02:14:43,950 --> 02:14:44,990
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

2898
02:14:45,790 --> 02:14:46,830
Du-du-du-du.

2899
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,120
Where was it?

2900
02:14:53,860 --> 02:14:54,560
I guess...

2901
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:54,980
Because it...

2902
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:56,720
Because I know, like, with, uh...

2903
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:57,920
Supermoon, like, the...

2904
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:59,440
It's actually closer to Earth.

2905
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,740
But not in this case.

2906
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:04,480
But yeah, it's tonight.

2907
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:06,540
Teehee.

2908
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:07,900
Any sturgeons in chat?

2909
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:11,240
I noticed that last night it's been looking pretty big.

2910
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:12,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2911
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:15,160
Cool.

2912
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:17,160
I like it.

2913
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:18,720
And if it starts...

2914
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:19,680
It starts to...

2915
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:22,240
Like, make it feel like it's spooky time, you know?

2916
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:23,580
Teehee.

2917
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:25,540
Starting to feel...

2918
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:27,780
Especially when the moon gets orange and...

2919
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:28,900
And everything.

2920
02:15:36,650 --> 02:15:37,850
Supermoon is...

2921
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:40,250
Closer to Earth and aligned with the sun.

2922
02:15:42,250 --> 02:15:43,590
I like space.

2923
02:15:48,230 --> 02:15:49,790
Looking forward to...

2924
02:15:49,790 --> 02:15:50,490
To fall.

2925
02:15:51,090 --> 02:15:52,550
Hold on, let me write snack time.

2926
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:54,150
Or, like, little break.

2927
02:15:54,410 --> 02:15:55,150
Sorry, guys.

2928
02:15:57,810 --> 02:15:59,010
Little break.

2929
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:03,350
That's me.

2930
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:03,990
A little break.

2931
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:06,310
Mogu mogu.

2932
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:10,690
And then, I think...

2933
02:16:10,690 --> 02:16:11,610
There's, like, a...

2934
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:13,810
There's, like, a meteor shower that's happening...

2935
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:15,530
Soon.

2936
02:16:16,130 --> 02:16:17,470
I can't remember the date.

2937
02:16:17,470 --> 02:16:18,570
I think it's next week.

2938
02:16:22,130 --> 02:16:22,730
Uh...

2939
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:24,350
Uh...

2940
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:30,430
Basically, a big ol' big ol' meteor that's passing by us...

2941
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:31,810
It breaks off a little bit.

2942
02:16:31,950 --> 02:16:33,930
And it causes, like, a ton of...

2943
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:35,570
A ton of, you know...

2944
02:16:36,270 --> 02:16:38,210
Little tiny meteor showers.

2945
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:43,250
So much space stuff happening.

2946
02:16:43,410 --> 02:16:44,230
I don't know!

2947
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:44,350
Oh!

2948
02:16:46,510 --> 02:16:48,210
Do you guys remember that?

2949
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:51,390
Geeks plays in your comment room.

2950
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:52,210
Remind me.

2951
02:16:52,410 --> 02:16:53,590
Do you guys remember that?

2952
02:16:53,610 --> 02:16:55,210
I think it was a vine back then.

2953
02:16:55,390 --> 02:16:59,470
The girl that was just, like, playing as her little skit.

2954
02:16:59,650 --> 02:17:00,370
The skit.

2955
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:01,850
She's an angel and she's God.

2956
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:03,890
And she's like, Hey, God, what's up?

2957
02:17:03,950 --> 02:17:05,510
And God's like, Hey!

2958
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:07,230
Did you, um...

2959
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:08,950
Did you...

2960
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:10,070
Did you give the...

2961
02:17:10,070 --> 02:17:12,050
The dinosaurs that present I asked you?

2962
02:17:12,050 --> 02:17:14,270
And the angel goes, Yeah!

2963
02:17:14,490 --> 02:17:15,170
I made them...

2964
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:16,590
I made them a meteor.

2965
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:19,670
And he said, You made them meteor.

2966
02:17:20,130 --> 02:17:22,570
She goes, Yeah!

2967
02:17:22,730 --> 02:17:24,030
I made them a meteor.

2968
02:17:24,590 --> 02:17:27,330
And he says, Meteor.

2969
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:29,530
Like...

2970
02:17:30,590 --> 02:17:33,070
I told you to make them meteor.

2971
02:17:33,070 --> 02:17:33,350
Meteor.

2972
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:35,630
And she said, A meat.

2973
02:17:35,750 --> 02:17:37,390
And then the angel goes, A meteor.

2974
02:17:41,330 --> 02:17:42,450
More meaty.

2975
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:51,680
Do you guys remember that?

2976
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:57,340
It's such a funny skit.

2977
02:17:57,340 --> 02:18:00,200
And then the whole time she's like, Tearing up on you.

2978
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,760
She's like, I told you to make the meteor.

2979
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:13,270
It's so funny.

2980
02:18:15,650 --> 02:18:16,650
Never heard of it.

2981
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:17,710
You have to look it.

2982
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:18,810
You have to look it up.

2983
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:20,270
I'm not doing it justice at all.

2984
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:30,420
Making the dinosaurs meteor.

2985
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:33,800
Sounds too long to be a vine.

2986
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:34,960
How long were vines?

2987
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:38,440
Did you guys ever make any vines?

2988
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:40,460
My glasses are hot.

2989
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:42,760
Thanks.

2990
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:43,800
I'm...

2991
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:45,380
I'm nerding out today.

2992
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:48,540
Six seconds!

2993
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:50,140
Whoa.

2994
02:18:56,140 --> 02:18:57,660
I'm not good with like...

2995
02:18:57,660 --> 02:18:58,520
Especially videos.

2996
02:18:58,520 --> 02:18:59,900
I'm surprised I stream.

2997
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:03,860
Because I never like mid...

2998
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:06,800
Like...

2999
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:06,900
Like...

3000
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:07,960
Vines.

3001
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:10,080
I never make TikToks.

3002
02:19:10,340 --> 02:19:12,700
I barely even post videos to like...

3003
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:13,540
Twitter or anything.

3004
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:16,260
I...

3005
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:18,020
I...

3006
02:19:20,380 --> 02:19:20,900
Um...

3007
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:23,780
Hold on, K-Barn.

3008
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:25,420
Well, I'll read it in just a second.

3009
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:33,900
I just...

3010
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:37,320
I...

3011
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:38,020
I really...

3012
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:39,060
Never made so...

3013
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:39,740
Like...

3014
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:40,420
You know like...

3015
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:41,140
Some people will like...

3016
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:43,000
Just take videos of themselves with their friends.

3017
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:44,740
I never did that.

3018
02:19:47,740 --> 02:19:48,920
I just...

3019
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:51,100
I just never did anything.

3020
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:52,320
Meh.

3021
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:54,600
War drop what I eat.

3022
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:58,100
The Combine's deal is they conquer and enslave other species...

3023
02:19:58,100 --> 02:20:01,480
Then improve them with cybernetics and add them to their army.

3024
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:05,260
The Zen invaders from Half-Life 1 were fleeing from Combine and led them to Earth.

3025
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:05,960
Ah!

3026
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:07,760
Okay, that's why they're here.

3027
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:10,300
I do remember that...

3028
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:14,100
We went to Zen and we saw all those poor guys that were...

3029
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:17,100
That were enslaved and...

3030
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:20,480
I wasn't supposed to shoot them and I did on accident.

3031
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:23,720
Dr. Cranberry!

3032
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:24,860
Thank you so much for that.

3033
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:28,220
Super chat for my favorite game ever.

3034
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:30,980
Fun fact, this game and Snake Eater were released in the same year.

3035
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:32,840
2004 was goaded.

3036
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:33,980
Wow!

3037
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:35,740
And you know what?

3038
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:37,220
Both look so amazing.

3039
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:39,360
Gosh.

3040
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:42,100
The early 2000s...

3041
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,380
It's so...

3042
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:45,320
I get sad about like...

3043
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:47,760
And I know other people think about this too sometimes.

3044
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,320
About like how with gaming...

3045
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,120
We've reached...

3046
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:55,560
So many peaks in such a short amount of time.

3047
02:20:56,260 --> 02:20:57,780
That it's like...

3048
02:20:57,780 --> 02:20:58,760
You know...

3049
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:02,480
We'll never kind of experience that again in a way.

3050
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:03,340
Like...

3051
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:06,260
We'll never be able to see this...

3052
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:07,800
This...

3053
02:21:08,010 --> 02:21:09,540
Evolution of...

3054
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:10,340
Of...

3055
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:12,540
The craft in front of our eyes.

3056
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:15,000
It's kind of crazy.

3057
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:19,000
Like...

3058
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:19,940
Like...

3059
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:21,060
VR is the only thing...

3060
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:21,600
I guess...

3061
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:22,280
Yeah...

3062
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:22,760
I mean...

3063
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:24,500
Obviously there's still places to go.

3064
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:25,060
But like...

3065
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:27,360
Everybody keeps striving for more and more realism.

3066
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:28,180
And...

3067
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:29,140
I'm like...

3068
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:29,360
No!

3069
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:32,680
Stylization is so much better than realism.

3070
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:33,100
Please!

3071
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:34,820
I'm a realism hater.

3072
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:35,820
I'm like...

3073
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:39,220
I can see when it's good.

3074
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:40,280
Like I understand.

3075
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:42,400
But...

3076
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:43,820
At the same time...

3077
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:45,280
Hey Minky...

3078
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:46,500
Will you possibly play...

3079
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:48,580
Half-Life Alyx after this in VR?

3080
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,140
Possibly with your 3D.

3081
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:51,480
Is it long?

3082
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:54,120
Because if it's not too long...

3083
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:55,220
I think I could do it.

3084
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:56,820
But I've never done like a...

3085
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:58,900
Like a shooter...

3086
02:21:58,900 --> 02:21:59,960
In...

3087
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:02,100
VR...

3088
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:04,710
Yeah...

3089
02:22:04,710 --> 02:22:05,810
Realism has it's place.

3090
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:07,810
But...

3091
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:09,990
Usually I'm just like...

3092
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:10,670
Style...

3093
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:11,870
Stylistic...

3094
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:12,610
Make it...

3095
02:22:12,610 --> 02:22:13,230
Make it look...

3096
02:22:13,230 --> 02:22:15,230
So many games just all look the same now!

3097
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:17,130
Cause they're all just like...

3098
02:22:17,130 --> 02:22:17,750
Hi...

3099
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:19,670
I'm a realistic looking lady.

3100
02:22:19,950 --> 02:22:21,690
I'm a realistic looking man.

3101
02:22:22,690 --> 02:22:24,230
And I can't tell!

3102
02:22:24,450 --> 02:22:26,090
The graphics all look the same!

3103
02:22:29,050 --> 02:22:29,490
Ugh...

3104
02:22:29,490 --> 02:22:31,750
You should 100% play Expedition 33.

3105
02:22:32,290 --> 02:22:34,430
I've heard a lot of good stuff about it.

3106
02:22:34,610 --> 02:22:36,090
Kiwawa was super into it.

3107
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:38,750
Unfortunately my lunch break is over!

3108
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:39,770
Have a good day!

3109
02:22:39,890 --> 02:22:39,990
Have a good day!

3110
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,250
Have a good day!

3111
02:22:40,810 --> 02:22:42,170
Thanks for dropping by!

3112
02:22:44,510 --> 02:22:45,390
Ooh Nan...

3113
02:22:45,390 --> 02:22:46,390
You're throwing punches there.

3114
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:51,410
Kojima was jealous of Half-Life when making MGS2.

3115
02:22:51,610 --> 02:22:52,350
Wait, is that real?

3116
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:54,530
I can't tell if it's real or not.

3117
02:22:56,610 --> 02:22:58,490
Every game should be Ace Combat.

3118
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:03,170
Half-Life Alyx is 12 hours!

3119
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:05,970
12 hour game...

3120
02:23:06,430 --> 02:23:07,090
In VR?

3121
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:07,970
That's pretty rough.

3122
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:08,810
I'm not gonna lie.

3123
02:23:11,310 --> 02:23:14,190
I just re-watched your tour of the V Shoujo Minecraft server.

3124
02:23:14,350 --> 02:23:15,990
Was obvious back then that you were joining?

3125
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:19,570
No!

3126
02:23:20,090 --> 02:23:22,510
Actually I don't think I was back then.

3127
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:25,410
Wait, when did I stream that?

3128
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:28,210
I don't think I was.

3129
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:30,730
I don't think I had decided yet.

3130
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:38,920
I do just like to hang out with the girlies sometimes.

3131
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:40,560
You know, I love Henya.

3132
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:42,040
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3133
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:45,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3134
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:46,180
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3135
02:23:46,180 --> 02:23:47,640
A second Exhibition 33...

3136
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,300
Isn't it turn-based?

3137
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:50,120
I hate...

3138
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:51,500
Sorry, I hate turn-based...

3139
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:52,940
Even though I'm not like...

3140
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:54,760
I don't have the...

3141
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:55,560
The...

3142
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:55,920
The...

3143
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:58,020
The reflexes for...

3144
02:23:58,460 --> 02:23:59,820
For just action stuff.

3145
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,020
I just...

3146
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:01,440
I don't know.

3147
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:01,500
I don't know.

3148
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:03,700
Not a big turn-based fan.

3149
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,440
Turn-based, but with timing...

3150
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,040
Timing-based dodging.

3151
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:20,680
I see.

3152
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:21,460
Except for Pokemon.

3153
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:22,420
That's so true!

3154
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:25,540
For some reason, Pokemon doesn't feel like turn-based to me.

3155
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:27,440
Even though it's the definition.

3156
02:24:36,650 --> 02:24:38,110
What about Metal Gear Acid?

3157
02:24:38,170 --> 02:24:39,470
Why do you think I haven't played it yet?

3158
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:43,190
Also, because it's...

3159
02:24:44,530 --> 02:24:46,350
Turn-based and cards.

3160
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:48,490
It's like the worst combination ever.

3161
02:24:54,890 --> 02:24:57,690
I hated turn-based before I played Baldur's Gate 3.

3162
02:24:57,910 --> 02:24:59,610
I think I would be fine with it now.

3163
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:02,650
I think I would be okay with it now.

3164
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:05,090
I think maybe I was...

3165
02:25:06,190 --> 02:25:06,470
Hmm.

3166
02:25:07,710 --> 02:25:09,670
Because I played Final Fantasy as a kid.

3167
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:12,410
And I was like...

3168
02:25:12,410 --> 02:25:12,610
Yeah.

3169
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:14,690
And then I played Kingdom Hearts.

3170
02:25:14,830 --> 02:25:15,490
I think that's what happened.

3171
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:16,630
I played Final Fantasy.

3172
02:25:17,010 --> 02:25:19,650
And then I played Kingdom Hearts and I was like...

3173
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:22,710
I was like...

3174
02:25:23,890 --> 02:25:26,490
And Kingdom Hearts is so easy.

3175
02:25:26,490 --> 02:25:30,630
It's so friendly for like...

3176
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:31,890
For...

3177
02:25:31,890 --> 02:25:32,550
For me.

3178
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:35,390
I hope you one day check out Bayonetta.

3179
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:38,870
I was talking to Maddie about Bayonetta.

3180
02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:40,430
Because...

3181
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:43,690
We were talking about DMC and Bayonetta.

3182
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:44,370
And...

3183
02:25:44,370 --> 02:25:46,870
She was saying how she went from Bayonetta to DMC.

3184
02:25:47,490 --> 02:25:47,810
And how...

3185
02:25:48,830 --> 02:25:50,870
She was so used to...

3186
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:51,490
How...

3187
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:52,750
How Bayonetta is like so...

3188
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:53,930
Flowy.

3189
02:25:54,390 --> 02:25:55,110
And smooth.

3190
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:56,270
And light.

3191
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:58,510
And then Dante is heavy, heavy, heavy.

3192
02:26:00,770 --> 02:26:01,610
So maybe.

3193
02:26:04,850 --> 02:26:06,310
Feel like you may have mentioned before.

3194
02:26:06,430 --> 02:26:08,770
But will you be going to the Holo EN concert at the end of August?

3195
02:26:09,290 --> 02:26:10,330
Unfortunately, no.

3196
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:13,070
Sad, no.

3197
02:26:13,610 --> 02:26:14,070
I...

3198
02:26:15,410 --> 02:26:17,200
I had a really great time at HoloFest.

3199
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:21,650
HoloExpo.

3200
02:26:22,490 --> 02:26:24,390
I don't remember how they word theirs.

3201
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:28,430
Because I was able to see the screen.

3202
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:30,410
I...

3203
02:26:30,410 --> 02:26:32,010
I went to one of the shows.

3204
02:26:32,010 --> 02:26:33,410
I went to the one...

3205
02:26:33,410 --> 02:26:34,350
Um...

3206
02:26:34,350 --> 02:26:34,850
At, uh...

3207
02:26:34,850 --> 02:26:35,910
Anime Week in Atlanta.

3208
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:38,870
And I couldn't see anything the entire time.

3209
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:40,070
And I was like...

3210
02:26:45,650 --> 02:26:47,250
It was, uh...

3211
02:26:47,250 --> 02:26:48,410
I literally couldn't see...

3212
02:26:48,410 --> 02:26:48,670
I...

3213
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:50,470
I would see Kiara's hat sometimes.

3214
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:54,970
So...

3215
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:56,130
You know...

3216
02:26:59,410 --> 02:26:59,970
But...

3217
02:27:03,050 --> 02:27:03,450
Um...

3218
02:27:04,710 --> 02:27:05,110
Yeah...

3219
02:27:07,090 --> 02:27:07,890
But, um...

3220
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:09,410
Also, isn't it...

3221
02:27:09,410 --> 02:27:11,210
It's during Anime NYC, no?

3222
02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:14,650
I think that's the same weekend as MGS Con, which I will be at.

3223
02:27:15,810 --> 02:27:17,430
I'm a guest at MGS Con.

3224
02:27:20,190 --> 02:27:20,590
So...

3225
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:22,190
Flo, easy fix.

3226
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:23,230
I don't want to be obvious.

3227
02:27:23,610 --> 02:27:26,210
I don't want people to be like, Oh, that girl's floating right there.

3228
02:27:27,990 --> 02:27:28,430
Like...

3229
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:34,150
It's AMYC weekend.

3230
02:27:34,450 --> 02:27:35,110
But not affiliated.

3231
02:27:35,450 --> 02:27:36,270
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3232
02:27:37,090 --> 02:27:37,290
Hmm.

3233
02:27:38,590 --> 02:27:39,470
Guest of honor.

3234
02:27:39,630 --> 02:27:40,510
I'm a guest of honor.

3235
02:27:40,690 --> 02:27:42,690
They sent me my schedule for things that I'm doing.

3236
02:27:43,510 --> 02:27:43,870
Uh...

3237
02:27:43,870 --> 02:27:44,450
MGS Con.

3238
02:27:44,910 --> 02:27:46,250
You will see me...

3239
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:46,970
Several times...

3240
02:27:47,730 --> 02:27:49,270
Throughout the day if you are going.

3241
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:50,050
Hehehe.

3242
02:27:52,330 --> 02:27:52,610
Yeah.

3243
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:56,110
So...

3244
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:56,750
Okay.

3245
02:27:57,230 --> 02:27:58,510
Um, let me take my medicine now.

3246
02:27:59,390 --> 02:28:00,550
And then I will...

3247
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:01,530
Actually, it feels better.

3248
02:28:01,770 --> 02:28:02,970
Maybe the salt is helping.

3249
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:21,640
Hmm.

3250
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:27,960
Sorry, I'm really bad at taking pills.

3251
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:33,590
At MGS Con, I am doing things online.

3252
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:36,710
I think actually everything that I have going on will also be online.

3253
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:38,450
I think it's...

3254
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:39,910
Supposed to be digi...

3255
02:28:39,910 --> 02:28:41,390
Part of the digital con and also...

3256
02:28:43,570 --> 02:28:44,050
Uh...

3257
02:28:44,050 --> 02:28:45,350
Minus one thing.

3258
02:28:45,490 --> 02:28:47,210
I think there's one thing that's digital exclusive.

3259
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:51,710
But everything else should be...

3260
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:53,250
Also both at...

3261
02:28:53,250 --> 02:28:55,370
At the convention and then also...

3262
02:28:55,370 --> 02:28:55,890
Online.

3263
02:28:56,190 --> 02:28:56,790
Hehehe.

3264
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:02,210
Still obvious.

3265
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:04,130
Whatever you say, buddy.

3266
02:29:04,410 --> 02:29:05,010
But...

3267
02:29:06,910 --> 02:29:07,510
Uh...

3268
02:29:07,510 --> 02:29:08,170
Uh...

3269
02:29:08,170 --> 02:29:10,070
There's a lot of people on the...

3270
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:11,550
On the Minecraft server.

3271
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:16,940
Yeah.

3272
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:17,940
Anyway.

3273
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:18,440
Okay.

3274
02:29:25,580 --> 02:29:26,180
Um...

3275
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:28,040
Very important fan told about MGS Con.

3276
02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:28,540
Hehehe!

3277
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:29,540
I have a digital ticket!

3278
02:29:29,740 --> 02:29:30,360
Thank you, guys!

3279
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:31,600
Thank you, thank you!

3280
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:33,700
Yeah, virtual stream.

3281
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:34,440
It should be fun.

3282
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:36,180
Um...

3283
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:37,500
I'm very excited for it.

3284
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:38,360
I'm very excited.

3285
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:39,340
I'm very excited.

3286
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:39,780
Okay.

3287
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:41,360
I'm back.

3288
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:42,660
I'm back at the game.

3289
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:44,340
Okay.

3290
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:46,020
Minky Gaiman.

3291
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:50,220
So...

3292
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:50,700
Oh, this...

3293
02:29:50,820 --> 02:29:51,640
This says supply.

3294
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:53,260
So...

3295
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:54,460
There's nothing in it.

3296
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:54,840
Oh, wait.

3297
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:55,760
No, I gotta charge.

3298
02:29:55,960 --> 02:29:56,300
Just kidding.

3299
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:05,760
Oh, don't break my boxes!

3300
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:07,140
I like to do that part!

3301
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:13,310
I just stand here and I...

3302
02:30:15,990 --> 02:30:17,770
Okay, I'm gonna save because I don't know...

3303
02:30:17,770 --> 02:30:19,650
Where I saved...

3304
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:19,910
Where I saved...

3305
02:30:20,370 --> 02:30:20,690
Hey!

3306
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:26,750
The music in this one is so...

3307
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:27,270
Kinda freaky.

3308
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:31,070
This game feels like a horror game for real.

3309
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:35,240
Oh!

3310
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:36,260
Oh, yeah.

3311
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:38,020
You got that one.

3312
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:42,380
I got some.

3313
02:30:45,420 --> 02:30:46,460
Oh, sorry.

3314
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:47,580
I forgot to take off my break.

3315
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:48,340
Teehee.

3316
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:49,860
There we go.

3317
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:53,820
I drank a second so much for the 20 games and thank you!

3318
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:55,860
Thank you, thank you.

3319
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:56,660
I'm letting my...

3320
02:30:57,340 --> 02:30:57,640
Ox power...

3321
02:30:58,660 --> 02:30:59,420
Power up.

3322
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:00,300
Okay, take that.

3323
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:01,720
Take that.

3324
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:02,420
Wait.

3325
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:03,120
Take that?

3326
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:06,780
You want that?

3327
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:07,900
Oh, no.

3328
02:31:12,410 --> 02:31:13,350
Why don't you take it?

3329
02:31:13,770 --> 02:31:14,570
Okay, anyway.

3330
02:31:15,570 --> 02:31:16,450
It was in here.

3331
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:20,530
I like...

3332
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:20,970
Uh...

3333
02:31:20,970 --> 02:31:21,310
That...

3334
02:31:21,310 --> 02:31:24,610
That one looks a little messier than the other symbols that we've been seeing.

3335
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:25,510
Is it a fake?

3336
02:31:26,170 --> 02:31:27,690
Will they do that to trick you?

3337
02:31:28,890 --> 02:31:30,070
Okay, so we go in there.

3338
02:31:33,310 --> 02:31:34,470
He said icky.

3339
02:31:35,470 --> 02:31:36,110
Meow.

3340
02:31:42,030 --> 02:31:43,530
I once saw...

3341
02:31:44,230 --> 02:31:45,110
A symbol...

3342
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:45,830
What's it called?

3343
02:31:46,010 --> 02:31:47,410
The lamb...

3344
02:31:47,410 --> 02:31:47,770
Lambda symbol?

3345
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:49,790
I once saw it...

3346
02:31:50,050 --> 02:31:51,570
Like, when I was taking a walk.

3347
02:31:51,970 --> 02:31:53,530
And I was like...

3348
02:31:53,530 --> 02:31:53,790
What?

3349
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:03,200
I was like...

3350
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:03,440
Whoa!

3351
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:04,620
I...

3352
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:06,880
Why is half-life happening here?

3353
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,760
Just like half-life.

3354
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:10,160
I know!

3355
02:32:10,460 --> 02:32:11,120
I was actually...

3356
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:11,680
I was...

3357
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:12,960
I was noting out.

3358
02:32:17,590 --> 02:32:18,950
How do I get down there?

3359
02:32:22,480 --> 02:32:24,520
Was there a ladder and I missed it?

3360
02:32:29,110 --> 02:32:30,470
Did you just say nerd?

3361
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:37,340
It is down...

3362
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:37,800
Wait.

3363
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:38,740
Yeah.

3364
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:40,200
That's not a door.

3365
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:40,780
Yeah.

3366
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:44,020
I don't wanna fall and break my legs.

3367
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:49,330
Leap of faith.

3368
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:52,510
Oh.

3369
02:32:57,800 --> 02:32:58,360
Easy.

3370
02:32:59,360 --> 02:32:59,920
Easy.

3371
02:33:09,570 --> 02:33:11,490
I think I...

3372
02:33:12,010 --> 02:33:13,010
Oh, it's the goo!

3373
02:33:16,650 --> 02:33:17,470
Radiation goo.

3374
02:33:18,590 --> 02:33:19,610
The Geiger count.

3375
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:20,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3376
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:23,390
What?

3377
02:33:23,390 --> 02:33:23,410
Alright.

3378
02:33:24,650 --> 02:33:25,090
Um...

3379
02:33:25,570 --> 02:33:27,190
I believe I know what I need to do.

3380
02:33:28,810 --> 02:33:29,590
Oh, here?

3381
02:33:31,270 --> 02:33:31,710
I...

3382
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:33,550
I don't think I need to go in there.

3383
02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:35,230
I feel like I have to follow the symbols.

3384
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:38,470
So I do this.

3385
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:45,340
Oh, no!

3386
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:46,660
There's just a friend here!

3387
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:47,820
Aw, friend!

3388
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:49,240
I'm sorry!

3389
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:51,580
I'm full on literally everything too.

3390
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,000
Unfortunate.

3391
02:33:58,580 --> 02:33:59,840
Do I go through then?

3392
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:00,540
I'm going in?

3393
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:03,400
I'm going in the sludge.

3394
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:04,140
Wow.

3395
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:05,080
There's so much here.

3396
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:05,960
I'm sorry, buddy.

3397
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:07,080
Can I pick you up?

3398
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:07,300
No.

3399
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:07,940
Okay.

3400
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:13,380
How am I supposed to not touch the wet goo if I need to go in there?

3401
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:19,900
There is dry goo.

3402
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:20,460
Wait.

3403
02:34:20,540 --> 02:34:21,260
So this is dry?

3404
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:22,280
Oh, no.

3405
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:22,840
This is wet.

3406
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:23,760
This...

3407
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:25,120
How does radiation levels...

3408
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:27,740
This is dry goo.

3409
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:32,860
Got it.

3410
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:36,960
Head crabs!

3411
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:37,980
Oh.

3412
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:40,100
Oh.

3413
02:34:40,420 --> 02:34:40,660
Oh.

3414
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:40,740
Hey!

3415
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:41,460
Hi!

3416
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:42,360
You're Freeman, aren't you?

3417
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:42,840
Yes!

3418
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:44,200
We got word you were coming.

3419
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:46,940
You got here at a bad time.

3420
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:49,820
Black Mesa East to station six.

3421
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:50,440
Do you read?

3422
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:52,220
Dr. Freeman is on his way down.

3423
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:55,100
You can.

3424
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:55,480
Repeat.

3425
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:57,440
Gordon Freeman has returned.

3426
02:34:59,280 --> 02:34:59,680
It's at East.

3427
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,020
Dang, they like me or something.

3428
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:02,560
We've got some ammo in those crates over there.

3429
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:04,240
Whoa!

3430
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:09,380
What about in here?

3431
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,360
I'm sorry.

3432
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:12,020
I broke your thing.

3433
02:35:13,580 --> 02:35:14,020
Okay.

3434
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:15,780
So that's the wet.

3435
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:24,700
Here we go.

3436
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:25,660
You hate this part?

3437
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:26,340
Oh, boy.

3438
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:26,760
Okay.

3439
02:35:27,060 --> 02:35:28,440
That means I'll probably hate it, too.

3440
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:30,600
I'm going.

3441
02:35:38,990 --> 02:35:40,230
Now this part rocks.

3442
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:43,390
Oh my god!

3443
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:43,710
Oh my god!

3444
02:35:45,110 --> 02:35:46,330
Oh, come on.

3445
02:35:46,550 --> 02:35:46,930
Oh no.

3446
02:35:48,010 --> 02:35:50,210
Oh, you guys have one hit for the headcrab, right?

3447
02:35:52,030 --> 02:35:53,090
Are they in the ground?

3448
02:35:54,190 --> 02:35:54,670
Oh,

3449
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:01,960
okay.

3450
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:03,740
Definitely, I'm gonna use my crowbar.

3451
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:07,660
Holy cow.

3452
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:12,160
Oh wow, their little town.

3453
02:36:21,970 --> 02:36:22,910
Get smacked.

3454
02:36:25,730 --> 02:36:27,010
Okay, nothing around over here.

3455
02:36:27,150 --> 02:36:27,330
Alright.

3456
02:36:29,730 --> 02:36:33,990
I'm starting to see the crates with the supply marker on it.

3457
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:35,630
I am.

3458
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:38,430
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3459
02:36:38,550 --> 02:36:39,650
See, that one doesn't have it.

3460
02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:41,490
I'm learning.

3461
02:36:42,170 --> 02:36:42,690
No!

3462
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:43,930
No!

3463
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:47,250
Wait, can I shoot it?

3464
02:36:48,650 --> 02:36:49,710
I saved you!

3465
02:36:53,330 --> 02:36:53,850
Maybe.

3466
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:56,190
I hear wood.

3467
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:58,110
I hear it like stomping around.

3468
02:37:03,390 --> 02:37:04,130
Come here!

3469
02:37:10,610 --> 02:37:11,390
What am I hearing?

3470
02:37:11,430 --> 02:37:12,310
I'm hearing something going...

3471
02:37:13,610 --> 02:37:14,770
Kinda freaked out.

3472
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:17,630
Chill out.

3473
02:37:18,710 --> 02:37:19,450
Chill out.

3474
02:37:19,450 --> 02:37:19,870
I don't...

3475
02:37:21,510 --> 02:37:21,990
Since...

3476
02:37:21,990 --> 02:37:22,170
Oh!

3477
02:37:24,850 --> 02:37:25,330
Okay!

3478
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:30,800
Oh gosh, he's really stupid.

3479
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:35,960
He's dumb, he's dumb!

3480
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:40,820
I don't think it's the Geiger counter.

3481
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:41,960
I can't tell what it is.

3482
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:45,160
He's that...

3483
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:48,720
He's such a stupid little thing.

3484
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:49,580
That's okay.

3485
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:51,540
I like him stupid.

3486
02:37:56,470 --> 02:37:57,130
Oh...

3487
02:37:57,130 --> 02:37:58,550
I got baited in that one.

3488
02:37:59,410 --> 02:37:59,770
Okay.

3489
02:38:01,310 --> 02:38:02,950
Electric wire, maybe?

3490
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:05,790
Oh, scary!

3491
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:08,050
Oh my god!

3492
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:20,660
Wait, don't scare me!

3493
02:38:22,060 --> 02:38:23,100
Holy cow!

3494
02:38:23,460 --> 02:38:23,920
That scared me!

3495
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:25,260
Oh, I don't like it.

3496
02:38:26,460 --> 02:38:28,200
Oh, that's the guy that was sitting over there.

3497
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:28,960
I did see him.

3498
02:38:29,560 --> 02:38:30,840
Oh my gosh.

3499
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:31,920
Oh my gosh!

3500
02:38:32,580 --> 02:38:33,620
This is horrible!

3501
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:36,140
Where are you?

3502
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:36,760
I hear you!

3503
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:39,260
Oh, there you are.

3504
02:38:39,620 --> 02:38:40,140
Nevermind.

3505
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:41,940
There you aren't.

3506
02:38:42,260 --> 02:38:42,540
Jump!

3507
02:38:47,490 --> 02:38:49,330
The headcrabs are so silly.

3508
02:38:50,290 --> 02:38:51,550
They're cracking me up.

3509
02:38:51,550 --> 02:38:52,450
Oh no, wait!

3510
02:38:52,630 --> 02:38:53,350
This is evil!

3511
02:38:53,770 --> 02:38:54,830
Okay, I have to...

3512
02:38:54,830 --> 02:38:55,150
Run!

3513
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:57,410
And be careful.

3514
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:02,570
Ouch, ouch!

3515
02:39:04,990 --> 02:39:06,910
That was more effective than my god.

3516
02:39:08,270 --> 02:39:08,790
Why?

3517
02:39:10,710 --> 02:39:12,770
Um, can I go through there, or...

3518
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:19,300
We...

3519
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:20,540
...clobbered.

3520
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:23,840
Why?

3521
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:24,800
Because Gordon's strong!

3522
02:39:25,540 --> 02:39:28,320
Pistol is so weak, I should just start using my...

3523
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:29,500
SMG.

3524
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:31,540
I do have a lot of ammo for it.

3525
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:32,560
Okay.

3526
02:39:37,940 --> 02:39:39,320
We on crate.

3527
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:41,820
This...

3528
02:39:56,220 --> 02:39:56,560
Hey!

3529
02:39:57,020 --> 02:39:57,800
Wait, did that hit me?

3530
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:00,080
Stop!

3531
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:01,080
Stop moving!

3532
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:03,840
Stop!

3533
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:05,340
Don't move.

3534
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:07,100
Don't close.

3535
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:08,960
Oh, ouch.

3536
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:09,600
Okay, okay, okay.

3537
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:10,460
It really does hurt me.

3538
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:10,960
Okay.

3539
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:17,060
Oh, the smoke.

3540
02:40:21,670 --> 02:40:22,950
You're gonna get electrocuted.

3541
02:40:25,010 --> 02:40:26,110
Oh, I missed one.

3542
02:40:26,550 --> 02:40:27,450
One guy buried.

3543
02:40:33,410 --> 02:40:35,270
You're in the radiation, idiot!

3544
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:41,800
Ouch.

3545
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:42,880
Oh, I'm stuck.

3546
02:40:43,560 --> 02:40:44,080
Guys.

3547
02:40:45,140 --> 02:40:45,580
Okay, hold on.

3548
02:40:45,580 --> 02:40:46,460
There was a health in here.

3549
02:40:46,660 --> 02:40:47,580
I can grab it.

3550
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:48,280
Yeah.

3551
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:49,360
Yeah, we're good.

3552
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:51,680
Oh, I lost everything for my suit.

3553
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:53,060
Everything is...

3554
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:53,220
Ah!

3555
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:54,320
Everything is terrible!

3556
02:40:57,400 --> 02:40:57,920
Move.

3557
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:00,940
You're throwing off my groove.

3558
02:41:06,210 --> 02:41:06,910
That way.

3559
02:41:09,210 --> 02:41:10,450
Why did they live here?

3560
02:41:12,450 --> 02:41:13,250
Oh, yes.

3561
02:41:14,970 --> 02:41:17,210
I love living by the hazardous waste.

3562
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:30,490
Rent is cheap.

3563
02:41:31,370 --> 02:41:31,790
Fair.

3564
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:45,320
Oh, they're letting me use the boat.

3565
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:45,680
That's right.

3566
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:47,620
He was filling it up.

3567
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:48,940
Hey, Dr. Freeman.

3568
02:41:49,140 --> 02:41:49,340
Hi!

3569
02:41:49,480 --> 02:41:50,500
I've been hoping you'd show up.

3570
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:52,640
Got this airboat all gassed up and ready to go.

3571
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:53,900
All your friends are dead.

3572
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:57,500
It's gonna be tough dodging civil protection out there in the open.

3573
02:41:57,640 --> 02:41:57,820
Oh, gosh.

3574
02:41:58,220 --> 02:41:59,340
Drive hard and you'll make it.

3575
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:00,640
I have just...

3576
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:02,020
Okay.

3577
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:03,340
Just a few bends up the river.

3578
02:42:03,740 --> 02:42:04,860
It's the old red barn.

3579
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:06,300
The old red barn.

3580
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:07,020
Climb on in.

3581
02:42:07,180 --> 02:42:07,800
Fire her up.

3582
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:09,840
All your friends are dead!

3583
02:42:16,470 --> 02:42:16,830
Okay.

3584
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:18,050
Go ahead and get in the boat, Dr. Freeman.

3585
02:42:18,050 --> 02:42:18,570
Okay.

3586
02:42:18,970 --> 02:42:19,610
I'm scared.

3587
02:42:19,850 --> 02:42:20,710
I don't think I'm gonna do it.

3588
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:23,870
Okay.

3589
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:25,110
So I just gotta dodge, right?

3590
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:25,410
Okay.

3591
02:42:25,530 --> 02:42:25,930
Speed.

3592
02:42:27,230 --> 02:42:27,990
Slow down.

3593
02:42:28,210 --> 02:42:28,630
Turn left.

3594
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:29,010
Okay.

3595
02:42:30,410 --> 02:42:31,430
See you later, lady.

3596
02:42:32,670 --> 02:42:32,890
Oh!

3597
02:42:33,070 --> 02:42:33,270
Oh!

3598
02:42:34,710 --> 02:42:35,330
Okay, hold on.

3599
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:36,410
Uh...

3600
02:42:36,410 --> 02:42:36,590
Wait.

3601
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:37,850
Beep!

3602
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:38,250
Beep!

3603
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:39,130
Beep!

3604
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:40,110
Beep!

3605
02:42:40,110 --> 02:42:41,070
Beep!

3606
02:42:42,910 --> 02:42:43,630
Alright.

3607
02:42:44,490 --> 02:42:45,710
Wait, this is kinda fun.

3608
02:42:46,730 --> 02:42:47,450
Beep!

3609
02:42:47,950 --> 02:42:48,670
Beep!

3610
02:42:49,090 --> 02:42:49,690
Where do I go?

3611
02:42:50,330 --> 02:42:51,050
Beep!

3612
02:42:59,170 --> 02:42:59,530
Here?

3613
02:42:59,950 --> 02:43:01,350
This looks like it should open.

3614
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:02,310
No?

3615
02:43:02,670 --> 02:43:03,110
Okay, just kidding.

3616
02:43:03,870 --> 02:43:05,030
No hands.

3617
02:43:05,590 --> 02:43:07,170
That's how I always do it, baby!

3618
02:43:07,170 --> 02:43:07,330
Speed!

3619
02:43:13,290 --> 02:43:14,530
Seven point turn.

3620
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:19,610
Can you drink the funny water?

3621
02:43:21,810 --> 02:43:22,370
Probably.

3622
02:43:23,670 --> 02:43:23,990
I

3623
02:43:29,770 --> 02:43:30,830
gotta open it myself.

3624
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:31,250
Okay.

3625
02:43:36,750 --> 02:43:38,950
I think I see where I open it.

3626
02:43:39,330 --> 02:43:39,570
Okay.

3627
02:43:39,790 --> 02:43:42,330
I think I see what I... Okay.

3628
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:44,250
So I like go up...

3629
02:43:44,250 --> 02:43:45,030
Oh.

3630
02:43:46,230 --> 02:43:46,790
Golly.

3631
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:48,010
Okay.

3632
02:43:49,190 --> 02:43:49,670
Um.

3633
02:43:55,260 --> 02:43:56,780
Can I drive on the land?

3634
02:43:57,020 --> 02:43:58,220
I was just gonna get out.

3635
02:44:00,040 --> 02:44:00,600
Oh.

3636
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:04,280
This is the... Land bu... Uh-oh.

3637
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:06,100
Guys, I don't think you can drive on the land.

3638
02:44:06,740 --> 02:44:07,160
Guys.

3639
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:09,400
Guys.

3640
02:44:09,720 --> 02:44:10,100
Uh-oh.

3641
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:12,420
Guys, I don't know if that's an option.

3642
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:12,980
Okay.

3643
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:13,920
Beep.

3644
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:14,960
Beep.

3645
02:44:16,580 --> 02:44:17,100
Beep.

3646
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:17,380
Beep.

3647
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:18,160
Beep.

3648
02:44:18,380 --> 02:44:18,900
Okay.

3649
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:19,580
All right.

3650
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:19,860
We're good.

3651
02:44:19,980 --> 02:44:20,180
We're good.

3652
02:44:20,700 --> 02:44:21,400
Oh, no.

3653
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:21,960
Please.

3654
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:22,720
I came in hot.

3655
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:24,160
Coming in hot.

3656
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:25,160
I mean, though.

3657
02:44:26,300 --> 02:44:26,540
Oh.

3658
02:44:27,460 --> 02:44:27,800
Break.

3659
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:29,020
Break.

3660
02:44:35,490 --> 02:44:36,630
I see you there.

3661
02:44:36,730 --> 02:44:38,570
You're not... You are not slick.

3662
02:44:39,570 --> 02:44:40,130
Where'd he go?

3663
02:44:41,910 --> 02:44:42,850
Yeah, ugly.

3664
02:44:47,150 --> 02:44:48,410
When did that happen?

3665
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:55,440
Is there a button?

3666
02:44:56,340 --> 02:44:57,520
I thought it was gonna... Oh.

3667
02:44:58,300 --> 02:44:58,840
Absolutely.

3668
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:01,720
No.

3669
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:02,920
No.

3670
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:04,280
No.

3671
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:04,860
No.

3672
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:05,280
No.

3673
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:05,700
No.

3674
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:05,920
No.

3675
02:45:05,960 --> 02:45:06,100
No.

3676
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:06,420
No.

3677
02:45:07,640 --> 02:45:08,180
Oh.

3678
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:08,780
Never mind.

3679
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:13,360
Gootie.

3680
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:19,660
Gootie.

3681
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:23,080
Oh.

3682
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:25,480
I don't think we take damage.

3683
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:30,380
Water hazard.

3684
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:42,880
One moment, please.

3685
02:45:44,460 --> 02:45:45,500
There's the red...

3686
02:45:52,230 --> 02:45:52,810
Look.

3687
02:45:52,990 --> 02:45:55,870
I used to... I used to not even see ladders.

3688
02:45:56,150 --> 02:45:57,590
And now, I'm a genius.

3689
02:45:59,770 --> 02:46:02,090
Now, I'm a genius.

3690
02:46:02,530 --> 02:46:04,310
Notice how low the water level is?

3691
02:46:04,570 --> 02:46:05,650
The com... The what?

3692
02:46:06,490 --> 02:46:08,590
Combine has been stealing our oceans.

3693
02:46:08,690 --> 02:46:08,910
Oh!

3694
02:46:11,150 --> 02:46:13,710
I'm seeing every ladder now.

3695
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:23,080
Hack that.

3696
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:28,510
In here?

3697
02:46:31,630 --> 02:46:33,510
It's quite peaceful out here, actually.

3698
02:46:33,870 --> 02:46:33,950
Oh.

3699
02:46:34,170 --> 02:46:34,270
Oh.

3700
02:46:34,530 --> 02:46:34,690
Oh.

3701
02:46:34,950 --> 02:46:35,050
Oh.

3702
02:46:35,390 --> 02:46:35,530
Oh.

3703
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:35,570
Oh.

3704
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:36,090
Oh.

3705
02:46:36,850 --> 02:46:37,730
I'm doing...

3706
02:46:37,730 --> 02:46:38,690
I'm doing flips.

3707
02:46:40,570 --> 02:46:41,430
Good day, Mean Dog.

3708
02:46:41,610 --> 02:46:42,130
It's a good one.

3709
02:46:42,210 --> 02:46:42,650
You too!

3710
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:43,150
Hey!

3711
02:46:43,270 --> 02:46:43,790
Thank you.

3712
02:46:50,770 --> 02:46:51,450
We're fine.

3713
02:46:51,610 --> 02:46:52,050
Everything's good.

3714
02:46:55,450 --> 02:46:56,890
No, our team!

3715
02:46:57,870 --> 02:46:58,470
Ouch!

3716
02:46:58,970 --> 02:46:59,490
Oh my gosh.

3717
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:02,370
You guys were supposed to help us!

3718
02:47:02,830 --> 02:47:04,090
I mean, us, me.

3719
02:47:07,970 --> 02:47:08,270
Ouch.

3720
02:47:14,170 --> 02:47:15,030
It's me.

3721
02:47:15,730 --> 02:47:16,110
Me.

3722
02:47:16,610 --> 02:47:16,990
All me.

3723
02:47:18,330 --> 02:47:19,430
All me, baby.

3724
02:47:21,310 --> 02:47:22,610
The royal we.

3725
02:47:22,970 --> 02:47:28,270
I always say we, usually, because I include you guys in my...

3726
02:47:29,430 --> 02:47:30,910
in my thought process.

3727
02:47:31,370 --> 02:47:32,850
It's like I like you guys or something.

3728
02:47:33,090 --> 02:47:33,450
I don't know.

3729
02:47:34,570 --> 02:47:35,510
Imagine that.

3730
02:47:38,570 --> 02:47:40,030
Should be one more, no?

3731
02:47:40,290 --> 02:47:41,170
Usually three...

3732
02:47:41,170 --> 02:47:42,390
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3733
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:44,990
Lacerations detected.

3734
02:48:17,080 --> 02:48:19,040
Rise and shine, Miss Phantom!

3735
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:25,920
No,

3736
02:48:30,550 --> 02:48:32,210
this place was supposed to be free and easy.

3737
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:47,730
There weren't supposed to be you guys here!

3738
02:48:48,370 --> 02:48:49,310
Wait, hello?

3739
02:48:50,950 --> 02:48:53,130
Get me off of this...

3740
02:48:53,130 --> 02:48:53,970
Uh uh...

3741
02:48:53,970 --> 02:48:54,630
This ladder, please.

3742
02:48:57,270 --> 02:48:57,750
Hello?

3743
02:48:58,570 --> 02:48:59,710
Why can't I move?

3744
02:49:00,170 --> 02:49:01,630
I keep just jumping back up.

3745
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:06,090
Please get me off.

3746
02:49:06,270 --> 02:49:07,490
I don't want to go back up!

3747
02:49:09,870 --> 02:49:10,350
Jump?

3748
02:49:10,350 --> 02:49:10,390
Jump?

3749
02:49:12,690 --> 02:49:13,510
I just...

3750
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:15,150
I guess I have to go down this way.

3751
02:49:20,630 --> 02:49:22,770
I think I'm gonna break my...

3752
02:49:23,830 --> 02:49:24,770
My legs.

3753
02:49:25,310 --> 02:49:25,990
My legs!

3754
02:49:28,090 --> 02:49:29,010
Ah, okay.

3755
02:49:29,390 --> 02:49:31,610
Find all Lambda caches in Half-Life 2.

3756
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:32,850
Lambda local.

3757
02:49:33,010 --> 02:49:34,290
I keep getting this achievement.

3758
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:35,290
Ha ha ha!

3759
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:38,690
I guess that's everything here, though, no?

3760
02:49:42,330 --> 02:49:42,830
Sad.

3761
02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:45,830
I really thought we'd have friends here.

3762
02:49:46,670 --> 02:49:47,870
Okay, we're full on everything else.

3763
02:49:47,990 --> 02:49:48,030
Oh!

3764
02:49:51,050 --> 02:49:51,450
Um...

3765
02:49:51,450 --> 02:49:52,030
I'll put you there.

3766
02:49:55,190 --> 02:49:55,990
It's progress.

3767
02:49:56,610 --> 02:49:56,770
Oh!

3768
02:49:57,650 --> 02:49:59,310
I didn't mean to blow it up.

3769
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:01,970
Oh, I see!

3770
02:50:02,150 --> 02:50:02,950
Because of here!

3771
02:50:04,250 --> 02:50:08,150
Oh, I didn't blow it up.

3772
02:50:08,450 --> 02:50:09,390
Can you put it on the boat?

3773
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:10,150
Great question.

3774
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:14,840
Um...

3775
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:15,800
I'll just leave it here.

3776
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:17,440
Okay.

3777
02:50:18,700 --> 02:50:19,380
Alright!

3778
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:20,900
Onwards!

3779
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:27,680
Imagine anything going right in this...

3780
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:28,660
Hellscape.

3781
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:42,480
But if I don't have friends...

3782
02:50:42,860 --> 02:50:43,660
Where do I go?

3783
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:44,940
They said go to the barn!

3784
02:50:46,180 --> 02:50:46,780
Oh!

3785
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:50,110
Whoa!

3786
02:50:50,490 --> 02:50:50,590
Whoa!

3787
02:50:50,910 --> 02:50:51,010
Whoa!

3788
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:51,290
Beep!

3789
02:50:51,670 --> 02:50:52,250
Beep!

3790
02:50:57,980 --> 02:50:58,580
Supplies!

3791
02:50:58,760 --> 02:50:58,900
Oh!

3792
02:50:59,440 --> 02:50:59,740
Ouch!

3793
02:51:00,060 --> 02:51:00,580
Who said that?

3794
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:04,540
Who said that?

3795
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:07,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3796
02:51:18,970 --> 02:51:19,990
Where is that thing?

3797
02:51:20,470 --> 02:51:20,690
Ah!

3798
02:51:22,510 --> 02:51:23,610
Leave me alone!

3799
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:29,600
Another one!

3800
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:30,700
Um...

3801
02:51:35,250 --> 02:51:35,670
Anyway...

3802
02:51:36,590 --> 02:51:37,430
Anyway...

3803
02:51:37,430 --> 02:51:39,130
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3804
02:51:41,810 --> 02:51:42,650
Whoa...

3805
02:51:43,270 --> 02:51:46,490
Like a little mouse...

3806
02:51:49,210 --> 02:51:50,470
The paparazzi...

3807
02:51:50,810 --> 02:51:51,530
They are so rude!

3808
02:51:51,790 --> 02:51:51,970
No!

3809
02:51:54,030 --> 02:51:54,450
Oh!

3810
02:51:54,790 --> 02:51:56,330
I'm supposed to...

3811
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,000
What's that sound?

3812
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,060
Oh, it's suspicious.

3813
02:52:08,380 --> 02:52:09,740
That was suspicious.

3814
02:52:10,520 --> 02:52:11,540
It's puzzle?

3815
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:14,160
Do I...

3816
02:52:14,160 --> 02:52:14,880
Okay, hold on.

3817
02:52:19,180 --> 02:52:21,100
Do I use these to...

3818
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:21,680
Bounce off of?

3819
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:24,660
Cause the issue was...

3820
02:52:24,660 --> 02:52:25,140
I got stuck.

3821
02:52:31,400 --> 02:52:32,600
So like...

3822
02:52:32,600 --> 02:52:33,500
Well, actually...

3823
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:33,820
Oh, wait.

3824
02:52:35,660 --> 02:52:36,260
Aha!

3825
02:52:36,880 --> 02:52:38,100
Okay, this...

3826
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:39,140
That needs to be...

3827
02:52:41,340 --> 02:52:42,100
Wait...

3828
02:52:42,100 --> 02:52:43,120
There's nothing in here.

3829
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:44,260
What the...

3830
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:46,040
Okay, hold on.

3831
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:46,980
Hi-yah!

3832
02:52:47,420 --> 02:52:47,780
Hi-yah!

3833
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:48,400
Okay.

3834
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:51,040
Let's take...

3835
02:52:52,380 --> 02:52:53,140
You...

3836
02:52:54,140 --> 02:52:54,900
You...

3837
02:52:54,900 --> 02:52:56,300
Um...

3838
02:52:56,300 --> 02:52:56,900
Crouch drop.

3839
02:52:58,280 --> 02:52:59,040
Now...

3840
02:52:59,040 --> 02:52:59,820
Down, boy!

3841
02:52:59,980 --> 02:53:00,220
Down!

3842
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:02,560
Uh...

3843
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:04,080
I need to get underneath...

3844
02:53:04,080 --> 02:53:05,080
Uh...

3845
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:06,180
Well, actually...

3846
02:53:09,850 --> 02:53:10,290
Oh...

3847
02:53:10,290 --> 02:53:11,130
Hmm...

3848
02:53:11,130 --> 02:53:12,090
It doesn't go the other way.

3849
02:53:12,370 --> 02:53:12,850
Thank you.

3850
02:53:12,970 --> 02:53:13,370
Thank you.

3851
02:53:13,710 --> 02:53:13,810
Thank you.

3852
02:53:14,290 --> 02:53:16,090
But I do see that it needs to go down...

3853
02:53:16,090 --> 02:53:16,710
To go up.

3854
02:53:16,930 --> 02:53:17,530
Oh, let's see.

3855
02:53:19,850 --> 02:53:20,650
Let's see now.

3856
02:53:21,030 --> 02:53:23,750
The stream is replenishing my life force after a tense work week.

3857
02:53:23,930 --> 02:53:24,790
Oh no, Sergey!

3858
02:53:26,130 --> 02:53:26,470
Can...

3859
02:53:26,470 --> 02:53:31,090
Can you make me smile in a way that clears the darkness in my very soul?

3860
02:53:31,090 --> 02:53:32,390
Oh, you can...

3861
02:53:32,390 --> 02:53:33,570
I thought you were asking me a question.

3862
02:53:35,150 --> 02:53:36,350
Can you do this for me?

3863
02:53:36,470 --> 02:53:39,250
I was like, wow, that's a pretty big offer, but...

3864
02:53:41,830 --> 02:53:43,330
That's a pretty big ask.

3865
02:53:45,970 --> 02:53:47,610
How do we do?

3866
02:53:48,210 --> 02:53:49,430
How do you do?

3867
02:53:52,670 --> 02:53:53,510
Okay, hold on.

3868
02:53:53,610 --> 02:53:54,710
Let's just collect these real quick.

3869
02:53:56,050 --> 02:53:58,370
If I want hint, I will ask.

3870
02:53:58,790 --> 02:54:00,530
But for now...

3871
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:05,700
Let me...

3872
02:54:05,700 --> 02:54:06,280
Say.

3873
02:54:10,150 --> 02:54:12,010
For now, let me...

3874
02:54:12,010 --> 02:54:12,390
Say.

3875
02:54:15,430 --> 02:54:17,090
Does this one have to be in here?

3876
02:54:18,430 --> 02:54:18,870
No.

3877
02:54:25,570 --> 02:54:26,750
I already got a hint.

3878
02:54:26,970 --> 02:54:27,210
What?

3879
02:54:28,250 --> 02:54:28,690
Ow!

3880
02:54:30,430 --> 02:54:31,850
Are you talking about...

3881
02:54:31,850 --> 02:54:35,310
You're like, oh, well, VTuber, actually, I posted the answer...

3882
02:54:35,310 --> 02:54:36,910
Five minutes ago, and you didn't read it.

3883
02:54:37,050 --> 02:54:37,630
That was your hint.

3884
02:54:40,250 --> 02:54:41,130
VTuber, actually...

3885
02:54:41,610 --> 02:54:44,490
You just didn't see that I sent you the hint...

3886
02:54:44,490 --> 02:54:45,530
Or I sent you the answer.

3887
02:54:47,550 --> 02:54:48,610
That was your hint.

3888
02:54:54,710 --> 02:54:56,410
Wait time I read my hint.

3889
02:54:57,670 --> 02:54:59,290
It's okay, VTubers don't read.

3890
02:54:59,510 --> 02:54:59,730
Nah.

3891
02:55:00,590 --> 02:55:00,930
Never.

3892
02:55:01,230 --> 02:55:02,810
Actually, I find that like...

3893
02:55:03,970 --> 02:55:05,890
I guess it really just depends on the person.

3894
02:55:06,130 --> 02:55:07,510
I don't watch a ton of streamers.

3895
02:55:07,710 --> 02:55:08,410
But I...

3896
02:55:08,410 --> 02:55:09,810
And I mostly only follow...

3897
02:55:11,350 --> 02:55:11,830
VTubers.

3898
02:55:11,970 --> 02:55:15,570
But of the streamers that I watch, they don't really read chat that much.

3899
02:55:19,470 --> 02:55:23,510
I think it's a hindrance to me, in fact, that I pay so much attention to you guys.

3900
02:55:24,730 --> 02:55:25,610
Little needy.

3901
02:55:28,170 --> 02:55:28,610
But...

3902
02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:29,970
Because it...

3903
02:55:30,350 --> 02:55:31,770
Makes me miss stuff, you know?

3904
02:55:31,910 --> 02:55:32,670
Because I'm like...

3905
02:55:33,350 --> 02:55:35,070
I'm just chit-chatting with you guys.

3906
02:55:38,530 --> 02:55:40,210
Oh wait, maybe we didn't...

3907
02:55:40,210 --> 02:55:40,670
Oh, wow!

3908
02:55:45,420 --> 02:55:46,140
Who was that?

3909
02:55:46,460 --> 02:55:47,180
Oh, that was me.

3910
02:55:54,360 --> 02:55:55,840
We need more in here.

3911
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:02,540
She got it?

3912
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:04,940
Oh god!

3913
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:09,980
I see what you mean by that was your hint.

3914
02:56:16,170 --> 02:56:18,130
Because I noticed too that it went down.

3915
02:56:18,150 --> 02:56:19,030
So I was like, uh-oh.

3916
02:56:20,870 --> 02:56:23,150
My big wrinkly brain.

3917
02:56:25,410 --> 02:56:28,150
You wanna talk about how wrinkly my brain is?

3918
02:56:32,480 --> 02:56:33,020
Perfect.

3919
02:56:36,850 --> 02:56:37,910
Back it up.

3920
02:56:38,090 --> 02:56:39,250
Back it up.

3921
02:56:39,490 --> 02:56:40,670
Back it up.

3922
02:56:40,930 --> 02:56:41,970
Back it up.

3923
02:56:41,970 --> 02:56:42,050
Back it up.

3924
02:56:43,970 --> 02:56:45,370
Is there anything over there?

3925
02:56:46,530 --> 02:56:47,530
That I missed?

3926
02:56:50,410 --> 02:56:51,510
Any supplies?

3927
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:54,750
Who was the guy that yelled at me anyway?

3928
02:56:54,750 --> 02:56:54,990
I'm gonna do it.

3929
02:56:58,110 --> 02:56:58,930
All right.

3930
02:56:59,930 --> 02:57:01,550
Put your glasses on.

3931
02:57:03,670 --> 02:57:04,150
Oh,

3932
02:57:51,790 --> 02:57:52,750
shoot.

3933
02:57:54,090 --> 02:57:54,270
Oh.

3934
02:57:55,710 --> 02:57:56,670
Ssss.

3935
02:57:57,090 --> 02:57:57,350
Up.

3936
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:05,840
There is a ramp!

3937
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:13,320
There is a ramp!

3938
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:14,020
There is a ramp!

3939
02:58:14,700 --> 02:58:15,160
There is a ramp!

3940
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:16,200
Every dead end has a ramp!

3941
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:16,700
Ha ha ha!

3942
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:19,020
Nyaaaaaaah!

3943
02:58:23,710 --> 02:58:24,350
Aw, man.

3944
02:58:24,430 --> 02:58:25,890
I think I missed the supplies up there.

3945
02:58:25,990 --> 02:58:26,730
I just saw it.

3946
02:58:27,410 --> 02:58:29,470
Oh, I see more supplies up there!

3947
02:58:30,110 --> 02:58:31,230
I'm missing everything!

3948
02:58:33,250 --> 02:58:34,130
I'm just...

3949
02:58:36,370 --> 02:58:38,310
I'm kinda cruising, not gonna lie.

3950
02:58:38,550 --> 02:58:39,090
Ha ha ha ha!

3951
02:58:39,310 --> 02:58:39,430
Oh!

3952
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:54,010
Now that we're here, is there anything else to look for?

3953
02:58:59,050 --> 02:59:00,130
Missed those barnacles.

3954
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:01,250
Yes, indeedy I did!

3955
02:59:09,190 --> 02:59:10,230
I have full health.

3956
02:59:11,590 --> 02:59:12,170
You're right.

3957
02:59:13,570 --> 02:59:15,370
I'm mostly looking for stuff for my suit.

3958
02:59:17,710 --> 02:59:18,110
Oh.

3959
02:59:19,330 --> 02:59:20,490
That's someone shooting at me.

3960
02:59:21,070 --> 02:59:22,210
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3961
02:59:22,930 --> 02:59:23,830
Nice try, buddy.

3962
02:59:24,710 --> 02:59:26,190
Wait, can I, like, get him right here?

3963
02:59:26,550 --> 02:59:27,230
That's so funny.

3964
02:59:27,370 --> 02:59:28,870
I guess if you go for, like, an all-kill...

3965
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:38,500
Open!

3966
02:59:38,960 --> 02:59:39,240
Sesame!

3967
02:59:40,600 --> 02:59:41,860
Open Sesame!

3968
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:43,200
La, la, la,

3969
02:59:53,670 --> 02:59:54,130
la...

3970
02:59:57,710 --> 02:59:58,630
Wup!

3971
02:59:58,990 --> 03:00:09,440
All red broken!

3972
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:33,860
Can't wait for the cover.

3973
03:00:37,140 --> 03:00:39,040
I think we found a power source.

3974
03:00:53,300 --> 03:00:54,940
They don't even have to...

3975
03:00:56,120 --> 03:00:57,140
Lock him up.

3976
03:01:00,820 --> 03:01:01,400
Nice.

3977
03:01:01,860 --> 03:01:08,310
Dang, this room is... You good?

3978
03:01:09,330 --> 03:01:10,070
Wake up.

3979
03:01:17,110 --> 03:01:19,610
Did you say romantic power?

3980
03:01:21,010 --> 03:01:22,810
Does he want to date me or something?

3981
03:01:26,030 --> 03:01:26,890
Oh my god.

3982
03:01:28,430 --> 03:01:29,550
He scared me.

3983
03:01:32,850 --> 03:01:34,590
He wants to date me or something.

3984
03:01:39,590 --> 03:01:40,730
Free man?

3985
03:01:44,270 --> 03:01:50,270
I guess I can't destroy... Is that a camera or a... It's not a turret.

3986
03:01:50,990 --> 03:01:51,990
Maybe it is.

3987
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:02,440
It's a camera.

3988
03:02:08,900 --> 03:02:10,200
Grenade is five.

3989
03:02:21,790 --> 03:02:23,030
Okay, it didn't work.

3990
03:02:24,490 --> 03:02:25,270
That's fine.

3991
03:02:25,830 --> 03:02:25,890
Oh.

3992
03:02:26,910 --> 03:02:27,250
Oh.

3993
03:02:29,810 --> 03:02:31,550
Does it... I guess it doesn't do anything?

3994
03:02:31,730 --> 03:02:32,150
Maybe.

3995
03:02:32,470 --> 03:02:33,150
I can't tell.

3996
03:02:35,770 --> 03:02:36,330
Scary!

3997
03:02:37,030 --> 03:02:38,170
I don't like it.

3998
03:02:44,010 --> 03:02:45,110
It does nothing?

3999
03:02:45,390 --> 03:02:45,950
Really?

4000
03:02:46,250 --> 03:02:47,070
That's kind of a shame.

4001
03:02:56,830 --> 03:02:58,270
I don't... I don't see you.

4002
03:02:58,570 --> 03:02:58,710
Wait.

4003
03:02:59,950 --> 03:03:00,710
There we go.

4004
03:03:03,130 --> 03:03:03,610
Ow!

4005
03:03:03,910 --> 03:03:04,110
Gosh!

4006
03:03:07,030 --> 03:03:07,510
Ah!

4007
03:03:10,110 --> 03:03:10,830
Man hack.

4008
03:03:12,090 --> 03:03:13,530
Can I get in through the door, please?

4009
03:03:22,820 --> 03:03:23,980
Where are they coming from?

4010
03:03:26,740 --> 03:03:28,200
Is that a man hack right there?

4011
03:03:31,260 --> 03:03:31,880
Oh, oh!

4012
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:32,460
Oh!

4013
03:03:36,040 --> 03:03:37,100
Oh, yeah!

4014
03:03:37,780 --> 03:03:38,940
Oh my gosh, that's cool.

4015
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:40,900
So we need to feed them, you know.

4016
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:43,420
Ah, neat, neat, neat.

4017
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:47,480
What am I doing in here?

4018
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:48,580
Opening the door.

4019
03:03:52,960 --> 03:03:55,340
This game is very generous with health and stuff.

4020
03:03:56,540 --> 03:03:57,680
Way more than before.

4021
03:04:00,760 --> 03:04:02,500
I know that I need to open the door.

4022
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:03,780
Oh!

4023
03:04:05,720 --> 03:04:07,420
Not that one, but you know, the...

4024
03:04:07,420 --> 03:04:08,800
The one that we're trying to get through.

4025
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:11,320
Ouch!

4026
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:11,660
Ouch!

4027
03:04:13,820 --> 03:04:14,560
My aim.

4028
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:16,740
I wish I could zoom and shoot.

4029
03:04:17,460 --> 03:04:18,180
Can I?

4030
03:04:18,400 --> 03:04:18,700
No.

4031
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:19,920
I just shut the door.

4032
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:21,840
They shut the door.

4033
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:23,120
A ghost shut the door.

4034
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:25,020
Okay.

4035
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:27,860
Please!

4036
03:04:28,500 --> 03:04:29,360
Kill, kill!

4037
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:31,900
It's so hard to see the...

4038
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:34,400
My crosshairs.

4039
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:35,620
They're so tiny.

4040
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:39,220
Oh my god.

4041
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:42,200
My crosshairs are so itty-bitty.

4042
03:04:43,820 --> 03:04:45,680
They want you to use the nades.

4043
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:47,680
Ah, I guess that makes sense.

4044
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:49,160
Because they just gave it to me.

4045
03:04:56,870 --> 03:04:57,650
Will it reach?

4046
03:04:57,790 --> 03:04:58,610
I didn't think it would.

4047
03:05:14,330 --> 03:05:15,070
Did I get him?

4048
03:05:15,470 --> 03:05:16,630
I think I heard him.

4049
03:05:20,030 --> 03:05:20,530
It's okay.

4050
03:05:22,830 --> 03:05:24,010
Oh, wow.

4051
03:05:24,270 --> 03:05:24,910
Nice checkpoint.

4052
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:29,470
Okay.

4053
03:05:30,170 --> 03:05:31,190
Let's attempt.

4054
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:35,350
Try the ult for this.

4055
03:05:43,230 --> 03:05:44,340
Oh, nice!

4056
03:05:58,840 --> 03:06:00,900
Oh, we are out of the ult.

4057
03:06:01,140 --> 03:06:01,740
So sad.

4058
03:06:04,400 --> 03:06:05,320
Like a pro.

4059
03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:06,080
Thanks, guys.

4060
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:07,820
For the help.

4061
03:06:09,220 --> 03:06:11,460
I like these, like, gooey...

4062
03:06:12,400 --> 03:06:13,460
Walls that they have.

4063
03:06:13,460 --> 03:06:14,320
They're so fun.

4064
03:06:25,360 --> 03:06:26,160
Let's just throw.

4065
03:06:26,620 --> 03:06:26,720
Oh!

4066
03:06:35,510 --> 03:06:36,650
I wonder how many we got.

4067
03:06:41,330 --> 03:06:42,450
Actually, let's do another one.

4068
03:06:48,910 --> 03:06:49,950
I think he's coming up.

4069
03:06:50,370 --> 03:06:50,530
Nope.

4070
03:06:50,930 --> 03:06:51,970
Not even a single guy!

4071
03:06:59,160 --> 03:06:59,960
Is that everybody?

4072
03:07:00,940 --> 03:07:01,380
Hello?

4073
03:07:04,310 --> 03:07:04,950
Hello?

4074
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:04,990
Hello?

4075
03:07:09,630 --> 03:07:10,270
Gosh.

4076
03:07:10,670 --> 03:07:11,590
This game is so generous.

4077
03:07:12,470 --> 03:07:14,190
This game is so generous.

4078
03:07:14,690 --> 03:07:15,410
One more.

4079
03:07:15,910 --> 03:07:16,750
Bottom right corner.

4080
03:07:18,730 --> 03:07:21,050
They should all be looking out for me.

4081
03:07:21,410 --> 03:07:22,670
They should all be scared.

4082
03:07:22,670 --> 03:07:23,750
So scared.

4083
03:07:24,770 --> 03:07:25,390
Frightened.

4084
03:07:25,590 --> 03:07:26,910
Shaking in their little booties.

4085
03:07:27,130 --> 03:07:28,090
Oh, I thought this was a ladder.

4086
03:07:29,090 --> 03:07:30,110
Just kidding.

4087
03:07:30,670 --> 03:07:31,170
Oh.

4088
03:07:35,660 --> 03:07:36,400
A ghost!

4089
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:40,920
Are these the ones that I threw?

4090
03:07:42,560 --> 03:07:43,340
That's crazy.

4091
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:46,840
Did I get your stuff, too?

4092
03:07:48,240 --> 03:07:48,520
Okay.

4093
03:07:49,540 --> 03:07:50,860
Thank you so much, motherfucker.

4094
03:07:51,360 --> 03:07:51,920
Thank you!

4095
03:07:52,700 --> 03:07:53,680
A-g-g-g-g.

4096
03:07:53,860 --> 03:07:54,780
A-g-g-g.

4097
03:07:54,980 --> 03:07:55,740
A-g-g-g.

4098
03:07:55,960 --> 03:07:56,960
A-g-g-g-ghost!

4099
03:07:57,760 --> 03:07:58,160
Okay.

4100
03:07:59,480 --> 03:08:00,220
Uh, this way.

4101
03:08:00,320 --> 03:08:00,620
My bad.

4102
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:14,440
Oh.

4103
03:08:26,210 --> 03:08:27,650
Do I blow it up?

4104
03:08:30,810 --> 03:08:31,550
Do I...

4105
03:08:31,550 --> 03:08:32,930
I don't think that I can blow up.

4106
03:08:36,670 --> 03:08:41,470
The radio calls are actually unique to the chapter and have a whole log of what they mean in our forest.

4107
03:08:41,790 --> 03:08:41,930
Seriously?

4108
03:08:45,290 --> 03:08:48,510
Use the crowbar and just stick it in there and...

4109
03:08:50,550 --> 03:08:51,450
Look around.

4110
03:08:51,830 --> 03:08:52,390
I'm looking!

4111
03:08:53,450 --> 03:08:53,970
I'm...

4112
03:08:57,590 --> 03:08:59,250
Do we have to get to the other side?

4113
03:09:01,190 --> 03:09:02,690
And then use this?

4114
03:09:02,930 --> 03:09:04,290
And have it go...

4115
03:09:06,410 --> 03:09:06,790
Okay.

4116
03:09:08,550 --> 03:09:10,270
Where the hell do I get to the other side?

4117
03:09:13,790 --> 03:09:14,790
You still have it right here?

4118
03:09:15,030 --> 03:09:15,470
You do?

4119
03:09:35,500 --> 03:09:36,280
See what happens.

4120
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:39,660
Oh.

4121
03:09:40,780 --> 03:09:41,460
That's not good.

4122
03:09:42,320 --> 03:09:43,120
Oh, it did work!

4123
03:09:43,300 --> 03:09:44,120
Okay, I think we gotta go.

4124
03:09:46,760 --> 03:09:47,120
Uh...

4125
03:09:47,120 --> 03:09:48,060
Alarm does not sound good.

4126
03:09:48,460 --> 03:09:49,420
Alarm does not sound good.

4127
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:50,860
Uh...

4128
03:09:51,260 --> 03:09:52,220
Oh, shit.

4129
03:09:52,900 --> 03:09:53,360
Oh, shit.

4130
03:09:53,560 --> 03:09:53,880
Oh, shit.

4131
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:04,840
Oh, shit.

4132
03:10:04,840 --> 03:10:05,020
Oh, shit.

4133
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:05,660
Golly!

4134
03:10:07,100 --> 03:10:07,780
Die, please.

4135
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:21,900
Stop it!

4136
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:22,720
Don't take my picture!

4137
03:10:22,940 --> 03:10:23,120
Ow!

4138
03:10:28,550 --> 03:10:29,770
I think I hear another one.

4139
03:10:32,770 --> 03:10:33,330
Oh my god.

4140
03:10:33,470 --> 03:10:33,790
Oh my god.

4141
03:10:33,850 --> 03:10:34,230
Oh my god.

4142
03:10:34,310 --> 03:10:34,650
Oh my god.

4143
03:10:34,670 --> 03:10:35,050
Oh my god.

4144
03:10:35,090 --> 03:10:35,450
Oh my god.

4145
03:10:35,450 --> 03:10:35,830
Oh my god.

4146
03:10:35,970 --> 03:10:36,130
Die!

4147
03:10:36,310 --> 03:10:36,590
Die!

4148
03:10:36,870 --> 03:10:36,910
Die!

4149
03:10:39,350 --> 03:10:40,650
I'm trying to take cover, please.

4150
03:10:43,130 --> 03:10:44,050
Oh, this is not good.

4151
03:11:02,080 --> 03:11:02,400
What?

4152
03:11:03,320 --> 03:11:03,880
What is that?

4153
03:11:04,720 --> 03:11:08,430
Any of them died.

4154
03:11:08,590 --> 03:11:09,070
That's so sad.

4155
03:11:09,990 --> 03:11:11,010
Turret to save ammo.

4156
03:11:11,230 --> 03:11:12,430
Oh wait, that's such a good idea!

4157
03:11:14,090 --> 03:11:15,010
I hate this thing.

4158
03:11:15,190 --> 03:11:16,730
I hate this thing so much.

4159
03:11:16,730 --> 03:11:18,450
I'm my heckin' life.

4160
03:11:25,930 --> 03:11:27,810
I think, uh...

4161
03:11:27,810 --> 03:11:29,410
I think the car is even moving.

4162
03:11:29,950 --> 03:11:31,810
Um, I think I destroyed that thing.

4163
03:11:32,170 --> 03:11:32,650
So...

4164
03:11:32,650 --> 03:11:33,950
That's nice, at least.

4165
03:11:35,570 --> 03:11:36,930
Oh, I did get a few guys!

4166
03:11:37,430 --> 03:11:38,130
Let's go.

4167
03:11:39,170 --> 03:11:40,290
I did grab a few.

4168
03:11:49,930 --> 03:11:51,070
I'm just gonna save.

4169
03:11:51,590 --> 03:11:51,990
Oh no.

4170
03:11:55,110 --> 03:11:55,590
Okay.

4171
03:11:56,130 --> 03:11:57,930
Um, and then we know...

4172
03:11:57,930 --> 03:11:59,970
I'm gonna bounce it off the wall.

4173
03:12:03,210 --> 03:12:03,850
Oops.

4174
03:12:04,110 --> 03:12:05,370
That did not have...

4175
03:12:05,370 --> 03:12:08,310
Nearly as much bounce as I thought it would.

4176
03:12:10,490 --> 03:12:11,770
It just...

4177
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:12,750
It just...

4178
03:12:13,810 --> 03:12:15,090
It just...

4179
03:12:15,090 --> 03:12:15,290
It just...

4180
03:12:15,290 --> 03:12:15,970
Bang, bang!

4181
03:12:18,730 --> 03:12:20,030
I have nearly...

4182
03:12:20,030 --> 03:12:20,470
I have nearly...

4183
03:12:21,690 --> 03:12:23,730
As much bounce...

4184
03:12:25,190 --> 03:12:26,670
As I thought it would.

4185
03:12:27,450 --> 03:12:28,650
That's a little embarrassing.

4186
03:12:46,360 --> 03:12:46,720
Ow!

4187
03:12:46,920 --> 03:12:47,800
Where did you come from?

4188
03:12:52,750 --> 03:12:53,670
Please die!

4189
03:12:54,630 --> 03:12:55,470
Please die!

4190
03:12:56,610 --> 03:12:58,210
At least you have infinite source of grenades...

4191
03:12:58,210 --> 03:12:59,030
You're right!

4192
03:12:59,170 --> 03:12:59,630
You're right!

4193
03:13:01,630 --> 03:13:02,930
I could grab some more.

4194
03:13:04,950 --> 03:13:05,790
Yes, yes.

4195
03:13:08,870 --> 03:13:10,670
And then there's the other guy over here.

4196
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:25,100
Oh my goodness!

4197
03:13:25,980 --> 03:13:27,200
Maybe I'll just do this.

4198
03:13:28,980 --> 03:13:29,500
Yeah!

4199
03:13:29,500 --> 03:13:31,360
Oh, come on!

4200
03:13:31,620 --> 03:13:32,000
No!

4201
03:13:49,780 --> 03:13:50,620
This sucks.

4202
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:53,700
Which way is he coming?

4203
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:57,680
I got him.

4204
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:01,620
Oh, there's another guy?

4205
03:14:05,280 --> 03:14:06,160
Two of them!

4206
03:14:06,240 --> 03:14:06,620
Three of them!

4207
03:14:08,820 --> 03:14:09,780
Four of them!

4208
03:14:10,220 --> 03:14:11,120
More of them.

4209
03:14:11,820 --> 03:14:12,580
Unlimited men.

4210
03:14:13,860 --> 03:14:15,800
Sorry, I keep going back in here.

4211
03:14:16,120 --> 03:14:17,320
I'm gonna grab more grenades.

4212
03:14:17,800 --> 03:14:19,520
We're just gonna keep grabbing grenades.

4213
03:14:20,320 --> 03:14:21,080
Aw, man.

4214
03:14:24,390 --> 03:14:26,790
You throw like a ghost!

4215
03:14:28,770 --> 03:14:30,130
Who's gonna tell him?

4216
03:14:30,990 --> 03:14:32,210
Who's gonna tell him?

4217
03:14:34,930 --> 03:14:36,010
There's a guy here, right?

4218
03:14:36,330 --> 03:14:37,290
Got his stuff.

4219
03:14:43,690 --> 03:14:44,850
Grab their stuff.

4220
03:14:45,290 --> 03:14:46,430
Grab their stuff.

4221
03:14:47,430 --> 03:14:47,810
Oh.

4222
03:14:49,290 --> 03:14:51,770
Is there anything else in here that I couldn't grab before?

4223
03:14:52,010 --> 03:14:52,370
Yes!

4224
03:14:53,950 --> 03:14:55,170
And even some health.

4225
03:14:55,390 --> 03:14:55,950
Okay, good, good, good.

4226
03:14:56,710 --> 03:14:57,590
Does he know?

4227
03:14:58,950 --> 03:14:59,950
Does he know?

4228
03:15:02,690 --> 03:15:04,990
You throw like a ghost girl!

4229
03:15:08,190 --> 03:15:08,630
Noice.

4230
03:15:10,550 --> 03:15:11,610
Okay, now I save.

4231
03:15:17,370 --> 03:15:18,630
Nice and peaceful over here.

4232
03:15:21,170 --> 03:15:21,610
Oh.

4233
03:15:21,910 --> 03:15:23,410
I guess I wasn't that big of a deal.

4234
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,900
Excuse me?

4235
03:15:38,020 --> 03:15:38,620
There was stuff in there?

4236
03:15:42,760 --> 03:15:43,980
Very nice.

4237
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:48,080
On the road again.

4238
03:15:49,100 --> 03:15:51,400
I can't wait to be young.

4239
03:15:55,940 --> 03:15:56,220
Oh my gosh.

4240
03:15:56,320 --> 03:15:57,020
Oh my gosh.

4241
03:15:57,220 --> 03:15:57,740
Oh.

4242
03:15:58,380 --> 03:15:58,460
Oh.

4243
03:15:59,120 --> 03:15:59,260
Break.

4244
03:15:59,500 --> 03:16:00,600
We're breaking free!

4245
03:16:05,280 --> 03:16:05,800
Ouch.

4246
03:16:06,700 --> 03:16:07,840
Oh, I did feel that.

4247
03:16:11,870 --> 03:16:12,390
Guys.

4248
03:16:13,230 --> 03:16:13,610
Um.

4249
03:16:13,870 --> 03:16:14,170
I don't know.

4250
03:16:25,510 --> 03:16:26,850
This part is hard.

4251
03:16:27,070 --> 03:16:28,010
Oh my gosh.

4252
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:30,150
Holy golly golly golly.

4253
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:30,950
Oh gosh.

4254
03:16:31,130 --> 03:16:31,670
Oh my gosh.

4255
03:16:32,390 --> 03:16:32,950
No.

4256
03:16:33,230 --> 03:16:33,370
Wait.

4257
03:16:33,650 --> 03:16:33,810
Ow!

4258
03:16:38,580 --> 03:16:39,140
Ah!

4259
03:16:39,440 --> 03:16:39,720
Oh.

4260
03:16:39,840 --> 03:16:40,120
What?

4261
03:16:40,220 --> 03:16:40,740
Oh my gosh.

4262
03:16:40,980 --> 03:16:41,140
What?

4263
03:16:41,440 --> 03:16:42,120
A stinking...

4264
03:16:43,600 --> 03:16:44,160
Checkpoint.

4265
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:46,020
What the hell?

4266
03:16:46,480 --> 03:16:46,780
Wait.

4267
03:16:46,920 --> 03:16:47,880
My health is like...

4268
03:16:47,880 --> 03:16:48,500
Not even...

4269
03:16:49,480 --> 03:16:51,260
Here to do this kind of...

4270
03:16:51,260 --> 03:16:51,380
Wait.

4271
03:16:52,480 --> 03:16:53,180
I see.

4272
03:16:53,280 --> 03:16:54,220
I see the ramp.

4273
03:16:54,380 --> 03:16:54,900
I see the ramp.

4274
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:00,680
We are...

4275
03:17:00,680 --> 03:17:00,860
Okay.

4276
03:17:14,790 --> 03:17:15,490
Just go.

4277
03:17:15,710 --> 03:17:16,210
Just go.

4278
03:17:16,450 --> 03:17:16,690
Just go.

4279
03:17:16,870 --> 03:17:17,290
Just go.

4280
03:17:17,450 --> 03:17:17,710
Just go.

4281
03:17:17,830 --> 03:17:18,150
Just go.

4282
03:17:18,670 --> 03:17:19,410
Holy cow.

4283
03:17:21,110 --> 03:17:22,870
Is this possible for me?

4284
03:17:23,050 --> 03:17:23,730
For my save?

4285
03:17:25,490 --> 03:17:26,330
Probably not.

4286
03:17:26,770 --> 03:17:27,130
Right?

4287
03:17:27,430 --> 03:17:28,050
I don't know.

4288
03:17:45,190 --> 03:17:47,070
And then I get burned.

4289
03:18:01,080 --> 03:18:02,460
Maybe not.

4290
03:18:04,360 --> 03:18:05,540
Maybe I'm sorry.

4291
03:18:08,240 --> 03:18:09,920
Maybe it's chill.

4292
03:18:12,980 --> 03:18:14,700
Maybe we're good.

4293
03:18:29,770 --> 03:18:32,270
Maybe everything's okay.

4294
03:18:34,610 --> 03:18:35,090
Oh.

4295
03:18:35,310 --> 03:18:35,890
That's not a hole.

4296
03:18:36,550 --> 03:18:37,790
Definitely thought it was.

4297
03:18:38,470 --> 03:18:38,650
Wait.

4298
03:18:38,710 --> 03:18:38,890
Hold on.

4299
03:18:38,970 --> 03:18:40,070
We can definitely parkour here.

4300
03:18:41,930 --> 03:18:42,750
We a hun...

4301
03:18:42,750 --> 03:18:42,890
Oh.

4302
03:18:43,650 --> 03:18:45,450
We a hundred percent can parkour here.

4303
03:18:49,170 --> 03:18:50,130
My health...

4304
03:18:50,130 --> 03:18:52,150
Is my own...

4305
03:18:52,150 --> 03:18:52,990
Concern.

4306
03:18:53,750 --> 03:18:55,470
I'm stupid at this stuff.

4307
03:18:55,870 --> 03:18:56,010
Wait.

4308
03:18:56,670 --> 03:18:57,990
Why can't I jump here?

4309
03:18:58,190 --> 03:18:59,610
Why do I have to go all the way around?

4310
03:19:02,290 --> 03:19:03,830
Let me just go here instead.

4311
03:19:04,150 --> 03:19:04,350
Okay.

4312
03:19:05,070 --> 03:19:05,390
Okay.

4313
03:19:06,770 --> 03:19:07,850
Where am I going?

4314
03:19:08,450 --> 03:19:09,270
Over there.

4315
03:19:10,530 --> 03:19:11,270
How to get...

4316
03:19:16,980 --> 03:19:17,620
Noise.

4317
03:19:18,180 --> 03:19:18,500
Yeah.

4318
03:19:18,820 --> 03:19:19,100
Noise.

4319
03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:22,360
Just jump there.

4320
03:19:26,330 --> 03:19:26,970
Wait.

4321
03:19:27,410 --> 03:19:27,910
Oh, wait.

4322
03:19:32,370 --> 03:19:33,790
I saw the pie seal.

4323
03:19:38,870 --> 03:19:40,070
I saw the pie seal.

4324
03:19:46,310 --> 03:19:48,550
I don't think I need to get up there.

4325
03:19:48,950 --> 03:19:50,270
I don't think there's anything actually.

4326
03:19:51,210 --> 03:19:52,530
It was all a ruse.

4327
03:19:54,070 --> 03:19:55,510
You are tensile.

4328
03:19:56,810 --> 03:19:58,690
Tell me something I don't know.

4329
03:20:01,250 --> 03:20:02,990
Though we do need to get in here.

4330
03:20:04,450 --> 03:20:05,050
So...

4331
03:20:13,380 --> 03:20:13,980
Onwards.

4332
03:20:19,910 --> 03:20:20,930
Anything in here?

4333
03:20:21,070 --> 03:20:21,990
Doesn't look like it.

4334
03:20:22,470 --> 03:20:23,070
Onwards.

4335
03:20:31,720 --> 03:20:32,520
Oh, no.

4336
03:20:33,280 --> 03:20:34,220
This looks scary.

4337
03:20:38,160 --> 03:20:39,900
Cats can't taste sweet.

4338
03:20:42,440 --> 03:20:43,500
No, don't say that.

4339
03:20:46,500 --> 03:20:47,720
Is the outfit new?

4340
03:20:47,900 --> 03:20:48,260
It's cute.

4341
03:20:48,480 --> 03:20:50,540
No, I just threw it in the dark.

4342
03:20:50,540 --> 03:20:51,440
It's on accident.

4343
03:20:52,240 --> 03:20:52,740
And it got...

4344
03:20:52,740 --> 03:20:54,080
You know...

4345
03:21:02,960 --> 03:21:03,460
Oh!

4346
03:21:03,960 --> 03:21:04,160
Okay.

4347
03:21:04,280 --> 03:21:04,900
They would do that.

4348
03:21:05,480 --> 03:21:05,740
Yeah.

4349
03:21:07,020 --> 03:21:07,180
Yeah.

4350
03:21:07,220 --> 03:21:07,700
That checks out.

4351
03:21:11,610 --> 03:21:12,390
I'm hiding.

4352
03:21:15,240 --> 03:21:16,660
I'm trying to find...

4353
03:21:16,660 --> 03:21:17,760
A place to go.

4354
03:21:18,080 --> 03:21:18,760
I'm lost.

4355
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:19,960
Little...

4356
03:21:19,960 --> 03:21:20,900
Little lost minky.

4357
03:21:21,980 --> 03:21:22,740
Oh, please.

4358
03:21:23,160 --> 03:21:24,760
Someone never get the penis to me.

4359
03:21:28,020 --> 03:21:29,560
Time for another side quest?

4360
03:21:29,900 --> 03:21:30,180
Really?

4361
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:32,720
In the boat?

4362
03:21:34,320 --> 03:21:35,060
Oh, gosh.

4363
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:36,500
I was in the right spot?

4364
03:21:36,740 --> 03:21:36,860
Okay.

4365
03:21:36,960 --> 03:21:38,920
I thought I was, but...

4366
03:21:42,110 --> 03:21:44,770
I didn't like it, so I was denying it.

4367
03:21:46,290 --> 03:21:48,010
I thought I was in the right spot.

4368
03:21:48,010 --> 03:21:51,350
I was like, ooh, I don't like the idea of this, so...

4369
03:21:51,350 --> 03:21:53,010
I'm just gonna say...

4370
03:21:53,010 --> 03:21:53,750
No.

4371
03:21:57,550 --> 03:21:59,450
How do I get these locks?

4372
03:22:00,070 --> 03:22:00,390
Wait.

4373
03:22:01,310 --> 03:22:02,010
Just kidding.

4374
03:22:05,250 --> 03:22:06,290
Don't answer that.

4375
03:22:26,460 --> 03:22:27,200
Oh, my God.

4376
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:27,840
Oh, my God.

4377
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:30,100
When did I...

4378
03:22:30,100 --> 03:22:30,440
Ah!

4379
03:22:31,300 --> 03:22:32,660
When did I get this gun?

4380
03:22:34,780 --> 03:22:36,540
When did I get the revolver?

4381
03:22:39,320 --> 03:22:39,820
Wait.

4382
03:22:39,920 --> 03:22:40,540
When did I get...

4383
03:22:40,540 --> 03:22:41,220
Just now?

4384
03:22:42,040 --> 03:22:42,340
Hi.

4385
03:22:42,480 --> 03:22:42,640
Dad.

4386
03:22:45,620 --> 03:22:46,120
Really?

4387
03:22:47,940 --> 03:22:49,280
Is this the supplies?

4388
03:22:49,280 --> 03:22:49,680
I just...

4389
03:22:49,680 --> 03:22:49,840
No.

4390
03:22:51,400 --> 03:22:51,880
Wait.

4391
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:52,940
Which number is that?

4392
03:22:54,620 --> 03:22:55,100
Ah!

4393
03:22:55,420 --> 03:22:55,620
Okay.

4394
03:22:58,860 --> 03:23:00,000
It was on the table.

4395
03:23:00,200 --> 03:23:00,600
I just...

4396
03:23:00,600 --> 03:23:01,280
I don't even look.

4397
03:23:01,300 --> 03:23:01,920
I just grab.

4398
03:23:03,460 --> 03:23:03,940
Wait.

4399
03:23:04,220 --> 03:23:04,340
No.

4400
03:23:04,700 --> 03:23:04,880
Ew.

4401
03:23:06,040 --> 03:23:06,860
This thing's powerful.

4402
03:23:26,140 --> 03:23:26,620
Ow!

4403
03:23:26,880 --> 03:23:28,660
Well, it's powerful if you can aim.

4404
03:23:29,080 --> 03:23:29,460
Really?

4405
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:53,020
Stop, please!

4406
03:23:59,440 --> 03:24:00,180
Oh, my gosh.

4407
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:00,420
No.

4408
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:07,360
And don't you want me to just keep running?

4409
03:24:07,500 --> 03:24:07,660
What?

4410
03:24:08,520 --> 03:24:09,320
I'm scared!

4411
03:24:09,500 --> 03:24:09,780
I'm running!

4412
03:24:10,020 --> 03:24:11,500
Oh, six shots.

4413
03:24:12,720 --> 03:24:13,680
Six shots.

4414
03:24:14,100 --> 03:24:14,640
Six shots.

4415
03:24:17,540 --> 03:24:19,200
Give me the health, please.

4416
03:24:26,580 --> 03:24:28,640
I should use my SMG here, maybe.

4417
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:30,880
It's all you need.

4418
03:24:31,100 --> 03:24:32,140
It is!

4419
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:53,400
Biggigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigigig

4420
03:25:07,330 --> 03:25:08,430
I'm just running for it.

4421
03:25:08,530 --> 03:25:09,370
I'm running for it.

4422
03:25:09,510 --> 03:25:10,430
I'm running for it.

4423
03:25:10,490 --> 03:25:11,230
I'm running for it!

4424
03:25:41,470 --> 03:25:42,990
Thank you for the awkward, Do-do.

4425
03:25:45,990 --> 03:25:47,010
Thank you for the hack.

4426
03:25:47,130 --> 03:25:47,430
I don't know.

4427
03:25:47,530 --> 03:25:48,410
Where is it going to put me?

4428
03:25:49,870 --> 03:25:50,550
Oh, okay.

4429
03:25:51,270 --> 03:25:51,970
That checks out.

4430
03:25:52,130 --> 03:25:52,770
That checks out.

4431
03:25:53,490 --> 03:25:54,330
But this is good.

4432
03:25:54,490 --> 03:25:55,730
That means I can be prepared.

4433
03:25:55,850 --> 03:25:58,210
I didn't notice that door, so...

4434
03:25:58,210 --> 03:25:59,810
Now I know that they're coming.

4435
03:26:08,390 --> 03:26:10,330
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4436
03:26:15,700 --> 03:26:17,340
This is pretty far back, isn't it?

4437
03:26:41,980 --> 03:26:43,620
What happened to saving often?

4438
03:26:43,980 --> 03:26:45,280
What happened to your manners?

4439
03:26:47,880 --> 03:26:49,660
I was in crisis earlier.

4440
03:26:52,440 --> 03:26:55,220
Do you... do you say...

4441
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:56,460
Ah!

4442
03:27:02,220 --> 03:27:04,300
Okay, I think what I'm gonna do here...

4443
03:27:04,300 --> 03:27:06,600
Is I think I'm just gonna run as much as I can.

4444
03:27:08,400 --> 03:27:09,460
Run and shoot.

4445
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:12,540
Run and shoot.

4446
03:27:13,540 --> 03:27:14,220
Oh, shoot.

4447
03:27:14,520 --> 03:27:15,040
Oh my god!

4448
03:27:16,440 --> 03:27:18,960
I just kicked my wallet into the trash can.

4449
03:27:22,120 --> 03:27:22,560
Um...

4450
03:27:23,380 --> 03:27:23,820
And...

4451
03:27:24,460 --> 03:27:24,900
Um...

4452
03:27:24,900 --> 03:27:25,700
And then I...

4453
03:27:25,700 --> 03:27:28,120
Once we get into that big room, I need to know where to go.

4454
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:30,340
So I'm just gonna run, run, run...

4455
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:33,460
Into the big room, if I can make it there.

4456
03:27:33,960 --> 03:27:35,680
So I can see where...

4457
03:27:35,680 --> 03:27:37,200
To go, because...

4458
03:27:37,740 --> 03:27:40,480
Having the helicopter will after me at the same time...

4459
03:27:40,480 --> 03:27:41,180
It's craziness.

4460
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:41,860
It's all crazy.

4461
03:27:51,090 --> 03:27:51,670
It's all crazy.

4462
03:28:17,310 --> 03:28:17,750
Whew!

4463
03:28:18,310 --> 03:28:18,610
Okay.

4464
03:28:19,070 --> 03:28:19,450
You know what?

4465
03:28:19,490 --> 03:28:20,070
I will save here.

4466
03:28:24,290 --> 03:28:24,730
Ouch!

4467
03:28:25,170 --> 03:28:25,950
It's a good thing I saved.

4468
03:28:25,950 --> 03:28:28,070
It just happened to me when I downloaded Umomoshime.

4469
03:28:31,990 --> 03:28:33,150
Oh, this is a dead end.

4470
03:28:33,250 --> 03:28:34,230
That's so evil!

4471
03:28:35,590 --> 03:28:35,990
Okay.

4472
03:28:36,150 --> 03:28:36,590
Now we're in.

4473
03:28:36,790 --> 03:28:37,790
Let's figure out...

4474
03:28:37,790 --> 03:28:38,930
Where we need to go.

4475
03:28:43,540 --> 03:28:43,940
Ouch!

4476
03:28:43,940 --> 03:28:44,140
Ouch!

4477
03:28:44,240 --> 03:28:44,340
Ouch!

4478
03:28:51,570 --> 03:28:52,590
That's just blood.

4479
03:28:59,650 --> 03:29:00,210
Please?

4480
03:29:00,590 --> 03:29:01,190
Come out.

4481
03:29:02,290 --> 03:29:02,990
I hear you.

4482
03:29:29,450 --> 03:29:30,370
No, there's...

4483
03:29:30,370 --> 03:29:31,030
Oh, I can't...

4484
03:29:31,030 --> 03:29:31,130
Okay.

4485
03:29:47,340 --> 03:29:48,460
That worked...

4486
03:29:48,460 --> 03:29:50,140
Well, better than I expected it to.

4487
03:29:57,820 --> 03:29:58,720
Oh my god.

4488
03:29:59,120 --> 03:29:59,300
Oh my god.

4489
03:29:59,300 --> 03:29:59,540
Nevermind.

4490
03:29:59,860 --> 03:30:00,360
I lied.

4491
03:30:00,440 --> 03:30:00,720
I lied.

4492
03:30:00,800 --> 03:30:01,180
I lied.

4493
03:30:01,300 --> 03:30:01,760
I lied.

4494
03:30:03,880 --> 03:30:04,580
I lied.

4495
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:04,960
I lied.

4496
03:30:06,380 --> 03:30:07,100
I don't...

4497
03:30:07,100 --> 03:30:08,700
I don't know where they come from either.

4498
03:30:12,400 --> 03:30:12,880
Ow!

4499
03:30:15,580 --> 03:30:16,060
Oh!

4500
03:30:16,420 --> 03:30:17,140
That's awkward.

4501
03:30:17,460 --> 03:30:17,760
Sorry.

4502
03:30:18,860 --> 03:30:19,920
I'm almost out of...

4503
03:30:22,840 --> 03:30:23,640
Where are you?

4504
03:30:24,780 --> 03:30:25,620
Where are you?

4505
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:26,360
Oh!

4506
03:30:40,240 --> 03:30:41,800
I need more health.

4507
03:30:42,060 --> 03:30:42,920
Before I...

4508
03:30:42,920 --> 03:30:43,120
Oh, wait.

4509
03:30:43,660 --> 03:30:44,080
Nice.

4510
03:30:44,540 --> 03:30:45,160
I see you.

4511
03:30:45,740 --> 03:30:47,460
I see you and I hear you.

4512
03:30:51,460 --> 03:30:52,000
Oh,

4513
03:30:59,180 --> 03:31:00,160
I think that was me actually.

4514
03:31:00,620 --> 03:31:01,900
Making all that noise.

4515
03:31:02,820 --> 03:31:03,820
No, little me.

4516
03:31:04,240 --> 03:31:04,480
Okay.

4517
03:31:09,150 --> 03:31:09,870
Oh, wait.

4518
03:31:10,370 --> 03:31:11,510
This is not the right...

4519
03:31:11,510 --> 03:31:12,590
Oh, I have to jump on top of these.

4520
03:31:12,590 --> 03:31:12,910
I see.

4521
03:31:14,390 --> 03:31:15,050
You know what?

4522
03:31:15,350 --> 03:31:15,790
I...

4523
03:31:15,790 --> 03:31:16,650
Will save.

4524
03:31:17,810 --> 03:31:18,250
Okay.

4525
03:31:20,770 --> 03:31:21,210
Wait.

4526
03:31:21,430 --> 03:31:22,430
I probably got more...

4527
03:31:23,730 --> 03:31:24,530
No, I did.

4528
03:31:24,730 --> 03:31:24,810
Oh.

4529
03:31:27,110 --> 03:31:27,550
We'll...

4530
03:31:27,550 --> 03:31:29,350
We'll stick with...

4531
03:31:29,810 --> 03:31:30,250
This.

4532
03:31:31,410 --> 03:31:32,290
Maybe that's...

4533
03:31:32,290 --> 03:31:33,710
Not the right thing to do, but...

4534
03:31:33,710 --> 03:31:33,910
Whatever.

4535
03:31:35,650 --> 03:31:35,870
Oh.

4536
03:31:36,210 --> 03:31:36,470
Oh.

4537
03:31:38,170 --> 03:31:38,570
Oh.

4538
03:31:38,650 --> 03:31:39,050
Parkour.

4539
03:31:42,210 --> 03:31:43,110
Oh, we get...

4540
03:31:43,110 --> 03:31:46,230
We get actually SMG ammo from these guys, so maybe it's fine too.

4541
03:31:48,050 --> 03:31:48,450
Yeah.

4542
03:31:49,930 --> 03:31:50,330
Yeah.

4543
03:31:50,890 --> 03:31:51,090
Okay.

4544
03:31:51,870 --> 03:31:52,190
All right.

4545
03:31:52,250 --> 03:31:52,630
Here we go.

4546
03:31:58,970 --> 03:32:00,010
Oh, the dam.

4547
03:32:00,270 --> 03:32:01,070
I was like, what is that?

4548
03:32:01,230 --> 03:32:02,110
I thought it was the...

4549
03:32:05,250 --> 03:32:05,670
Running.

4550
03:32:05,890 --> 03:32:06,430
We're running, running.

4551
03:32:09,190 --> 03:32:09,910
Please don't.

4552
03:32:11,190 --> 03:32:11,610
Please.

4553
03:32:12,730 --> 03:32:13,570
Please don't.

4554
03:32:14,530 --> 03:32:15,290
Oh my gosh.

4555
03:32:15,950 --> 03:32:16,330
No, no, no.

4556
03:32:16,850 --> 03:32:17,670
Maybe right here I'm safe.

4557
03:32:19,490 --> 03:32:21,090
Oh, he's crushing them for me.

4558
03:32:21,750 --> 03:32:21,910
Yeah.

4559
03:32:21,910 --> 03:32:22,270
Keep going.

4560
03:32:22,390 --> 03:32:22,670
Keep going.

4561
03:32:25,150 --> 03:32:25,990
Keep going.

4562
03:32:26,110 --> 03:32:26,330
Keep going.

4563
03:32:26,330 --> 03:32:27,930
Nope, nope, nope.

4564
03:32:28,110 --> 03:32:29,150
The boxes are right here.

4565
03:32:33,150 --> 03:32:33,970
Yeah, good job.

4566
03:32:34,530 --> 03:32:35,590
Good job, Watashi.

4567
03:32:41,540 --> 03:32:42,260
Oh my god.

4568
03:32:42,460 --> 03:32:42,760
Where?

4569
03:33:01,560 --> 03:33:02,680
You can zoom...

4570
03:33:02,680 --> 03:33:03,620
With the Magnum.

4571
03:33:03,820 --> 03:33:04,180
Kind of.

4572
03:33:04,460 --> 03:33:04,880
But...

4573
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:08,320
You can't zoom and shoot, no?

4574
03:33:08,840 --> 03:33:09,700
Or can you?

4575
03:33:10,220 --> 03:33:11,580
No, it won't let me here.

4576
03:33:17,080 --> 03:33:18,480
I see that downstairs.

4577
03:33:18,480 --> 03:33:19,480
I think that's a...

4578
03:33:22,440 --> 03:33:23,460
Is this a...

4579
03:33:23,460 --> 03:33:23,780
Health.

4580
03:33:23,960 --> 03:33:24,320
It is.

4581
03:33:24,480 --> 03:33:25,580
Is this like a boss?

4582
03:33:25,700 --> 03:33:26,480
Are we about to...

4583
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:28,580
Hit a boss?

4584
03:33:28,680 --> 03:33:30,140
And that's why it's giving me all this?

4585
03:33:34,700 --> 03:33:35,200
Wow.

4586
03:33:35,820 --> 03:33:36,320
Wow.

4587
03:33:36,680 --> 03:33:37,520
That's a lot.

4588
03:33:38,240 --> 03:33:38,460
Okay.

4589
03:33:41,640 --> 03:33:42,140
Nice.

4590
03:33:42,600 --> 03:33:42,760
Oh.

4591
03:33:43,080 --> 03:33:43,880
I need even more.

4592
03:33:45,380 --> 03:33:45,880
Okay.

4593
03:33:48,400 --> 03:33:48,900
Nice.

4594
03:33:51,060 --> 03:33:52,640
Yeah, you can't zoom and shoot.

4595
03:33:52,800 --> 03:33:53,700
So it's kind of frustrating.

4596
03:33:54,420 --> 03:33:56,240
You can shoot immediately after unzooming.

4597
03:33:56,380 --> 03:33:57,720
It takes practice, but works well.

4598
03:33:58,340 --> 03:33:58,760
Ah.

4599
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:01,160
I think I get it.

4600
03:34:02,820 --> 03:34:03,240
Ugh.

4601
03:34:06,320 --> 03:34:08,320
Trying to figure out when I want to end this.

4602
03:34:08,600 --> 03:34:10,660
I didn't realize it's been three and a half hours already.

4603
03:34:10,820 --> 03:34:11,500
But I did...

4604
03:34:11,500 --> 03:34:13,100
I did also...

4605
03:34:13,100 --> 03:34:13,960
Let's try the...

4606
03:34:13,960 --> 03:34:14,660
Let's try the fight.

4607
03:34:14,820 --> 03:34:15,720
And then maybe I'll...

4608
03:34:17,080 --> 03:34:17,860
I'll cut it.

4609
03:34:29,890 --> 03:34:31,830
My migraine is actually gone, luckily.

4610
03:35:02,720 --> 03:35:04,260
That was so unfortunate.

4611
03:35:12,460 --> 03:35:13,980
You got anything for me?

4612
03:35:16,880 --> 03:35:17,440
Jeez.

4613
03:35:18,820 --> 03:35:20,140
Can I kill it with the turret?

4614
03:35:27,320 --> 03:35:28,300
Take him down!

4615
03:35:32,680 --> 03:35:33,240
Oh.

4616
03:35:33,440 --> 03:35:33,540
Oh.

4617
03:35:33,800 --> 03:35:33,900
Uh.

4618
03:35:34,080 --> 03:35:34,220
Oh.

4619
03:35:34,800 --> 03:35:35,200
Here.

4620
03:35:41,720 --> 03:35:42,420
Is he gone?

4621
03:35:49,610 --> 03:35:50,010
Okay.

4622
03:35:50,130 --> 03:35:52,370
That makes things a little bit more peaceful now, doesn't it?

4623
03:35:52,930 --> 03:35:53,230
Holy.

4624
03:35:54,550 --> 03:35:55,310
Thank you, mister.

4625
03:35:55,310 --> 03:35:55,390
Sure.

4626
03:36:10,400 --> 03:36:13,340
The wind noises reminds me of...

4627
03:36:14,200 --> 03:36:15,970
When you're going around the...

4628
03:36:16,520 --> 03:36:17,140
What's it called?

4629
03:36:20,080 --> 03:36:20,620
Oh.

4630
03:36:20,800 --> 03:36:21,020
No, no.

4631
03:36:21,080 --> 03:36:21,900
I wanted to go up that.

4632
03:36:23,900 --> 03:36:24,440
The...

4633
03:36:24,440 --> 03:36:26,420
There's a par in MGS3.

4634
03:36:27,360 --> 03:36:29,520
You're like climbing up on the mountain and stuff.

4635
03:36:29,960 --> 03:36:31,140
That's just windy noises.

4636
03:36:31,540 --> 03:36:32,080
Reminds me of.

4637
03:36:36,430 --> 03:36:37,390
Good place to stop.

4638
03:36:37,510 --> 03:36:38,250
Should we stop today?

4639
03:36:39,030 --> 03:36:39,470
Here.

4640
03:36:40,470 --> 03:36:41,830
I'm having a lot of fun though.

4641
03:36:43,350 --> 03:36:43,790
Oh.

4642
03:36:44,130 --> 03:36:44,270
Well.

4643
03:36:46,170 --> 03:36:46,930
Come on.

4644
03:36:47,010 --> 03:36:47,410
Come on.

4645
03:36:47,430 --> 03:36:48,370
Let me parkour, please.

4646
03:36:51,570 --> 03:36:52,770
Why do I suck?

4647
03:36:52,770 --> 03:36:54,130
I don't know.

4648
03:36:57,670 --> 03:36:59,170
I don't know.

4649
03:37:00,110 --> 03:37:00,770
I don't know.

4650
03:37:00,770 --> 03:37:01,210
Gordon Freeman.

4651
03:37:01,830 --> 03:37:02,510
The man.

4652
03:37:02,770 --> 03:37:03,630
Well never...

4653
03:37:04,270 --> 03:37:05,850
You're just making it worse.

4654
03:37:10,990 --> 03:37:13,330
Next part is really stressful, is it?

4655
03:37:14,770 --> 03:37:15,410
Hmm...

4656
03:37:15,410 --> 03:37:16,550
Maybe there's nothing up here anyway.

4657
03:37:16,550 --> 03:37:18,750
Anyway, I can't tell.

4658
03:37:19,030 --> 03:37:22,250
I would be able to tell if I could see...

4659
03:37:22,250 --> 03:37:23,150
Oh well, anyway.

4660
03:37:23,410 --> 03:37:23,870
Okay, I give up.

4661
03:37:24,990 --> 03:37:25,910
I'm too big.

4662
03:37:27,870 --> 03:37:29,030
We have to go all...

4663
03:37:29,030 --> 03:37:30,710
We don't have to go all the way back, actually.

4664
03:37:32,550 --> 03:37:33,390
I lied.

4665
03:37:34,790 --> 03:37:36,490
Because there was a hole right over here.

4666
03:37:36,770 --> 03:37:37,730
I saw it.

4667
03:37:38,610 --> 03:37:39,750
Right here.

4668
03:37:40,610 --> 03:37:42,210
But also, I think I can just jump this.

4669
03:37:45,190 --> 03:37:45,590
Easy.

4670
03:37:56,340 --> 03:37:57,380
High core.

4671
03:37:58,900 --> 03:37:59,540
Baby.

4672
03:38:00,960 --> 03:38:07,160
I wish I could remember if there was any place that had health that I could...

4673
03:38:09,400 --> 03:38:10,680
That I...

4674
03:38:14,650 --> 03:38:17,010
Forgot, like, couldn't grab because I was full before.

4675
03:38:23,890 --> 03:38:25,110
I'm just gonna go.

4676
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:27,310
If I die, I'll end it.

4677
03:38:28,030 --> 03:38:29,550
I'll end it all!

4678
03:38:29,550 --> 03:38:30,690
I

4679
03:38:34,750 --> 03:38:36,350
was gonna say, that looks like mines.

4680
03:38:37,850 --> 03:38:39,170
Meow, meow!

4681
03:38:40,010 --> 03:38:40,550
What?

4682
03:38:43,670 --> 03:38:45,250
What if you never die?

4683
03:38:46,770 --> 03:38:47,710
So true.

4684
03:38:52,160 --> 03:38:53,340
Who's shooting at me?

4685
03:38:54,620 --> 03:38:55,640
Sick drip.

4686
03:38:59,280 --> 03:39:00,120
We made it!

4687
03:39:02,280 --> 03:39:04,080
I saved, and it saved as well.

4688
03:39:04,700 --> 03:39:05,640
Wow, this is so beautiful!

4689
03:39:06,780 --> 03:39:07,620
Wait, am I going the wrong way?

4690
03:39:08,100 --> 03:39:08,320
Oops!

4691
03:39:09,940 --> 03:39:10,600
I'm going the wrong way?

4692
03:39:13,760 --> 03:39:14,160
Oops!

4693
03:39:14,260 --> 03:39:14,440
I'm going to die!

4694
03:39:15,200 --> 03:39:16,000
Never punished!

4695
03:39:16,240 --> 03:39:16,720
Never punished!

4696
03:39:25,810 --> 03:39:27,250
The music is really cool, though.

4697
03:39:28,150 --> 03:39:29,210
Wait, the music's so cool.

4698
03:39:53,270 --> 03:39:53,890
Oh my god.

4699
03:39:54,070 --> 03:39:54,170
Wait.

4700
03:39:54,510 --> 03:39:54,690
Oh.

4701
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:03,760
Can I go through here?

4702
03:41:03,600 --> 03:41:04,800
Ouch, ous, ous, ous, ous, ous.

4703
03:41:09,100 --> 03:41:11,040
Yeah, I saw those planks, baby.

4704
03:41:15,200 --> 03:41:16,140
Oh my god, ous.

4705
03:41:16,260 --> 03:41:16,980
Oh, I'm not gonna...

4706
03:41:17,720 --> 03:41:19,020
I thought I was gonna hit it for sure.

4707
03:41:19,260 --> 03:41:20,120
That was crazy.

4708
03:41:20,660 --> 03:41:21,820
That was a sick joke.

4709
03:41:22,180 --> 03:41:22,740
Let's go!

4710
03:41:25,280 --> 03:41:27,240
Oh my god, it's getting even tighter in here.

4711
03:41:27,840 --> 03:41:32,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4712
03:41:32,060 --> 03:41:33,340
Okay, okay, we're good.

4713
03:41:33,560 --> 03:41:33,760
We're fine.

4714
03:41:33,880 --> 03:41:34,280
I saw!

4715
03:41:34,420 --> 03:41:34,880
I saw that!

4716
03:41:35,020 --> 03:41:35,340
Over there!

4717
03:41:40,020 --> 03:41:40,680
Oh, where?

4718
03:41:40,900 --> 03:41:41,540
Where to?

4719
03:41:45,700 --> 03:41:46,060
Oh,

4720
03:41:56,230 --> 03:41:57,550
oh, oh, oh, okay.

4721
03:41:58,690 --> 03:41:59,650
Break the door!

4722
03:41:59,930 --> 03:42:00,490
Oh, I'm stuck.

4723
03:42:00,730 --> 03:42:01,830
Wait, you guys, I'm stuck, actually.

4724
03:42:02,210 --> 03:42:03,070
Wait, you guys, I'm stuck.

4725
03:42:03,270 --> 03:42:03,370
Oh!

4726
03:42:20,630 --> 03:42:20,990
Anyway...

4727
03:42:25,390 --> 03:42:27,110
No hidden headcrab?

4728
03:42:36,420 --> 03:42:38,680
Evil, evil, evil, evil.

4729
03:42:42,440 --> 03:42:43,920
Someone said it's over.

4730
03:42:44,180 --> 03:42:45,340
It's definitely not.

4731
03:42:48,640 --> 03:42:49,340
Evil!

4732
03:42:50,080 --> 03:42:50,760
Okay.

4733
03:42:51,660 --> 03:42:52,360
Alright.

4734
03:42:53,240 --> 03:42:54,640
Um, I'm not quite...

4735
03:42:54,640 --> 03:42:56,000
Oh, can we get on this?

4736
03:42:56,260 --> 03:42:57,220
And then go down?

4737
03:42:57,220 --> 03:42:58,580
That'd be kind of neat.

4738
03:43:03,630 --> 03:43:04,850
Oh, there's supplies up here!

4739
03:43:05,730 --> 03:43:07,990
I almost missed it, but I got everything that I needed.

4740
03:43:11,970 --> 03:43:12,190
Okay.

4741
03:43:12,630 --> 03:43:12,730
Whew.

4742
03:43:14,090 --> 03:43:14,230
Huh.

4743
03:43:14,850 --> 03:43:15,290
Nyet?

4744
03:43:15,550 --> 03:43:15,850
No?

4745
03:43:16,130 --> 03:43:16,590
I cannot?

4746
03:43:18,370 --> 03:43:19,970
Park on the lift, then use it.

4747
03:43:22,890 --> 03:43:24,650
I got past the hardest part?

4748
03:43:24,730 --> 03:43:25,170
No way!

4749
03:43:48,960 --> 03:43:50,880
I thought I could do like a sick...

4750
03:43:56,260 --> 03:43:57,760
Like a damn...

4751
03:43:57,760 --> 03:43:58,840
She...

4752
03:43:59,360 --> 03:44:00,640
Jumped right into the sea!

4753
03:44:01,300 --> 03:44:02,440
I made it!

4754
03:44:03,080 --> 03:44:03,920
I don't know.

4755
03:44:04,060 --> 03:44:04,100
I don't know.

4756
03:44:04,100 --> 03:44:05,360
He's still exploding!

4757
03:44:06,020 --> 03:44:06,580
Stop!

4758
03:44:08,040 --> 03:44:08,980
Wait, will I make it?

4759
03:44:09,660 --> 03:44:09,980
Oh!

4760
03:44:10,800 --> 03:44:11,320
Oh!

4761
03:44:12,420 --> 03:44:12,660
Oh!

4762
03:44:12,660 --> 03:44:13,060
Oh!

4763
03:44:13,080 --> 03:44:14,100
I made it!

4764
03:44:14,100 --> 03:44:16,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4765
03:44:23,640 --> 03:44:25,360
They're not gonna make it!

4766
03:44:25,700 --> 03:44:27,420
They're not gonna make it!

4767
03:44:28,000 --> 03:44:29,580
They made it!

4768
03:44:30,100 --> 03:44:30,440
Ouch!

4769
03:44:33,500 --> 03:44:36,540
That was my favorite part of the dinosaur ride.

4770
03:44:36,700 --> 03:44:37,320
At Disney.

4771
03:44:38,120 --> 03:44:39,780
So basically, the...

4772
03:44:39,780 --> 03:44:40,540
the plot...

4773
03:44:41,260 --> 03:44:42,260
Wait, did I make it?

4774
03:44:42,380 --> 03:44:42,680
For real?

4775
03:44:43,100 --> 03:44:43,320
Ouch.

4776
03:44:44,040 --> 03:44:45,980
The plot of the dinosaur ride is...

4777
03:44:45,980 --> 03:44:47,660
you are going back in time...

4778
03:44:47,660 --> 03:44:49,440
to find an Iguanodon.

4779
03:44:49,440 --> 03:44:57,420
Um, because that has nothing to do with the actual dinosaur movie, but the Iguanodon was the main character.

4780
03:44:57,680 --> 03:44:58,620
I don't remember his name.

4781
03:44:58,840 --> 03:45:00,340
It might have just been Iguanodon.

4782
03:45:00,480 --> 03:45:00,880
Who knows?

4783
03:45:02,300 --> 03:45:05,960
But... Yeah, Iguanodon.

4784
03:45:07,800 --> 03:45:16,520
And... You go back in time to go find one, and they're just like, nope, that's...

4785
03:45:17,140 --> 03:45:20,060
That's a... That's a... Triceratops.

4786
03:45:20,220 --> 03:45:21,260
Try to find another one.

4787
03:45:21,440 --> 03:45:26,620
And then they're just like, oh, by the way, we also sent you back in time 30 seconds!

4788
03:45:26,960 --> 03:45:31,140
Or like, it was like one minute, or it was like 30 seconds before the meteor hits.

4789
03:45:31,300 --> 03:45:37,640
So they're just like... They're like, oh my god, you have to go right now!

4790
03:45:37,680 --> 03:45:39,360
You have to go immediately!

4791
03:45:39,880 --> 03:45:42,400
Why didn't they send us back with more time?

4792
03:45:42,720 --> 03:45:44,240
Who knows?

4793
03:45:44,240 --> 03:45:45,940
Yeah, this is the one at Animal Kingdom.

4794
03:45:47,040 --> 03:45:52,860
And then, at the very end of the ride, the guy is like, they're not gonna make it!

4795
03:45:53,020 --> 03:45:54,840
They're not gonna make it!

4796
03:45:55,780 --> 03:45:57,460
They made it!

4797
03:46:00,370 --> 03:46:01,490
It's so funny.

4798
03:46:01,670 --> 03:46:05,390
If you ever watch a video of it, the end is just so funny.

4799
03:46:05,490 --> 03:46:07,370
Because he's like, they're not gonna make it!

4800
03:46:07,530 --> 03:46:09,450
They're not gonna make it!

4801
03:46:14,020 --> 03:46:15,440
This is so silly.

4802
03:46:16,660 --> 03:46:18,040
Are we still in hell?

4803
03:46:18,120 --> 03:46:20,320
Or am I like, safe now?

4804
03:46:23,060 --> 03:46:25,720
Am I still in... am I being pursued?

4805
03:46:26,080 --> 03:46:28,320
Am I being courted still?

4806
03:46:36,450 --> 03:46:37,450
Safe for now.

4807
03:46:37,670 --> 03:46:38,850
I don't know if I believe you.

4808
03:46:41,150 --> 03:46:42,690
It's a puzzle time.

4809
03:46:48,450 --> 03:46:50,070
Well, this needs to be lifted.

4810
03:46:51,370 --> 03:46:52,710
Oh, there's also a pier.

4811
03:46:54,350 --> 03:46:55,310
Briefly safe.

4812
03:46:56,910 --> 03:46:59,610
You can have a little safety as a treat.

4813
03:47:08,020 --> 03:47:09,560
Hold on, let's look over here.

4814
03:47:09,640 --> 03:47:11,180
See what we got going on around.

4815
03:47:19,210 --> 03:47:20,610
Oh, gosh.

4816
03:47:22,370 --> 03:47:22,910
Nasty.

4817
03:47:35,800 --> 03:47:36,340
Spooky.

4818
03:47:39,400 --> 03:47:40,460
I don't need it, though.

4819
03:47:41,360 --> 03:47:44,540
Actually, I went from having five health.

4820
03:47:45,320 --> 03:47:47,520
Well, I guess that was a while ago, but...

4821
03:47:48,060 --> 03:47:50,040
We've really come around, huh?

4822
03:47:50,880 --> 03:47:52,580
Okay, I see this ladder here.

4823
03:47:52,780 --> 03:47:53,540
Let's see where it goes.

4824
03:47:54,780 --> 03:47:56,500
There's a lot going on in here.

4825
03:47:56,840 --> 03:47:57,200
Isn't there?

4826
03:47:59,680 --> 03:48:00,080
Ah!

4827
03:48:00,080 --> 03:48:00,300
Ah!

4828
03:48:00,800 --> 03:48:00,840
Ah!

4829
03:48:08,350 --> 03:48:08,790
Ah!

4830
03:48:08,790 --> 03:48:08,870
Okay.

4831
03:48:14,090 --> 03:48:15,030
Everything's coming up.

4832
03:48:15,230 --> 03:48:15,430
Mink.

4833
03:48:15,990 --> 03:48:16,230
Oh.

4834
03:48:16,690 --> 03:48:17,650
I tried to run.

4835
03:48:17,810 --> 03:48:19,550
Oh, it's because of my flashlight.

4836
03:48:21,930 --> 03:48:22,370
Ugh.

4837
03:48:22,510 --> 03:48:24,810
Has anyone made a mint pixel R&W place yet?

4838
03:48:24,910 --> 03:48:26,310
What is a W place?

4839
03:48:26,610 --> 03:48:28,390
But I did see some people making some.

4840
03:48:28,570 --> 03:48:28,730
Yeah.

4841
03:48:29,990 --> 03:48:31,030
Coral, welcome back.

4842
03:48:31,110 --> 03:48:31,750
Thank you.

4843
03:48:36,260 --> 03:48:37,260
No need to run?

4844
03:48:39,620 --> 03:48:41,020
Oh, because I'm just getting here?

4845
03:48:42,360 --> 03:48:43,560
The washing machine?

4846
03:48:44,940 --> 03:48:45,460
Maybe...

4847
03:48:45,460 --> 03:48:47,580
Is this thing so heavy?

4848
03:48:58,920 --> 03:48:59,800
I fell too.

4849
03:49:00,380 --> 03:49:01,980
A map where people draw...

4850
03:49:02,720 --> 03:49:03,760
Deltarune characters.

4851
03:49:04,520 --> 03:49:05,600
Then why am I there?

4852
03:49:07,940 --> 03:49:08,460
Oh.

4853
03:49:10,920 --> 03:49:12,240
Lift with your back.

4854
03:49:12,240 --> 03:49:14,240
I thought I was supposed to be so strong.

4855
03:49:15,780 --> 03:49:17,420
Come on, Gordon Freeman.

4856
03:49:17,420 --> 03:49:18,860
You can't even lift up a...

4857
03:49:19,700 --> 03:49:20,420
Washing machine?

4858
03:49:24,380 --> 03:49:25,560
I mean, they're gonna have a nap.

4859
03:49:25,640 --> 03:49:26,300
Have a nice nap!

4860
03:49:26,840 --> 03:49:29,700
Half-Life 2 was groundbreaking at the time.

4861
03:49:29,980 --> 03:49:31,640
Still quite fun, but definitely shows its...

4862
03:49:31,640 --> 03:49:32,800
Age with awkward...

4863
03:49:32,800 --> 03:49:35,180
Lurches from combat sections to seesaw puzzles.

4864
03:49:35,620 --> 03:49:37,360
I don't mind it so much, actually, though.

4865
03:49:38,700 --> 03:49:39,880
I'm having so much fun.

4866
03:49:40,720 --> 03:49:41,440
Which I...

4867
03:49:41,440 --> 03:49:43,880
I'm having so much fun, but I think I will...

4868
03:49:43,880 --> 03:49:44,960
Since we did get through the...

4869
03:49:44,960 --> 03:49:45,460
That...

4870
03:49:48,320 --> 03:49:48,680
Ah!

4871
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:50,400
I

4872
03:49:58,490 --> 03:49:58,970
did it!

4873
03:50:04,980 --> 03:50:05,940
But also...

4874
03:50:05,940 --> 03:50:06,880
Wait, there was a...

4875
03:50:06,880 --> 03:50:07,680
Oh, this...

4876
03:50:09,780 --> 03:50:10,260
Guys...

4877
03:50:12,460 --> 03:50:15,980
Guys, I thought that this tunnel was facing this direction.

4878
03:50:16,320 --> 03:50:17,860
I was like, gosh, there's so much to explore.

4879
03:50:17,860 --> 03:50:20,020
I didn't realize this is where I came from.

4880
03:50:20,480 --> 03:50:22,920
Why do I have big brain moments like this?

4881
03:50:23,020 --> 03:50:23,500
And then...

4882
03:50:24,480 --> 03:50:25,880
My brain also...

4883
03:50:25,880 --> 03:50:27,220
It's so small...

4884
03:50:27,220 --> 03:50:28,520
Do I go, thank you so much for the tech...

4885
03:50:28,520 --> 03:50:29,180
Thank you.

4886
03:50:32,120 --> 03:50:34,160
Thank you, guys, though, for all your help.

4887
03:50:34,440 --> 03:50:35,560
This has been so much fun.

4888
03:50:35,720 --> 03:50:36,420
It's definitely...

4889
03:50:38,920 --> 03:50:39,320
Um...

4890
03:50:39,320 --> 03:50:40,420
Definitely, I can...

4891
03:50:41,500 --> 03:50:41,900
I...

4892
03:50:42,740 --> 03:50:44,420
Play is much more smoothly.

4893
03:50:44,840 --> 03:50:46,900
It's much more forgiving than...

4894
03:50:46,900 --> 03:50:47,720
Half-Life 1.

4895
03:50:47,960 --> 03:50:49,680
Which tends to be the case with these...

4896
03:50:49,680 --> 03:50:50,300
Types of games.

4897
03:50:50,480 --> 03:50:51,940
You know, series and stuff like that.

4898
03:50:52,380 --> 03:50:52,780
But...

4899
03:50:52,780 --> 03:50:54,100
Oh, it's so much fun!

4900
03:50:54,680 --> 03:50:55,720
And I saved.

4901
03:50:56,280 --> 03:50:56,720
Wait.

4902
03:50:57,120 --> 03:50:57,980
I'm just going to save again.

4903
03:50:58,860 --> 03:50:59,600
New save.

4904
03:50:59,960 --> 03:51:00,140
Save.

4905
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:01,400
Oh, oh, oh.

4906
03:51:01,540 --> 03:51:02,020
Not a...

4907
03:51:02,020 --> 03:51:02,900
Not a quick save.

4908
03:51:03,020 --> 03:51:03,700
A real save.

4909
03:51:05,100 --> 03:51:05,480
Yeah!

4910
03:51:06,700 --> 03:51:07,140
So...

4911
03:51:07,600 --> 03:51:08,920
This was fun!

4912
03:51:09,140 --> 03:51:10,800
We will continue next week!

4913
03:51:11,080 --> 03:51:11,420
Next week!

4914
03:51:11,580 --> 03:51:12,040
Next week!

4915
03:51:12,600 --> 03:51:13,600
Thanks for the streaming key.

4916
03:51:13,740 --> 03:51:14,920
Loving the retro game arc recently.

4917
03:51:15,100 --> 03:51:16,920
Also, top quality boots and history stream.

4918
03:51:17,060 --> 03:51:17,760
Thank you!

4919
03:51:19,300 --> 03:51:20,300
Thank you, thank you.

4920
03:51:20,460 --> 03:51:22,100
Thank you for streaming at the time that you did.

4921
03:51:22,240 --> 03:51:22,420
Yeah!

4922
03:51:22,420 --> 03:51:29,060
I will stream at this time again next week as well.

4923
03:51:29,400 --> 03:51:30,000
So...

4924
03:51:31,660 --> 03:51:32,760
Yes, yes, yes.

4925
03:51:35,240 --> 03:51:38,220
I'll re-watch the VOD because it was fun!

4926
03:51:43,620 --> 03:51:44,220
That's...

4927
03:51:45,580 --> 03:51:46,780
That's so sweet!

4928
03:51:51,310 --> 03:51:52,370
That's so sweet!

4929
03:51:54,930 --> 03:51:55,950
Am I late?

4930
03:51:56,510 --> 03:51:56,970
No.

4931
03:51:57,590 --> 03:51:58,610
Well, I mean...

4932
03:51:59,850 --> 03:52:00,350
You...

4933
03:52:00,350 --> 03:52:00,730
You...

4934
03:52:00,730 --> 03:52:01,690
You came to...

4935
03:52:01,690 --> 03:52:02,490
You came at all.

4936
03:52:02,910 --> 03:52:04,230
You came to watch it all.

4937
03:52:04,610 --> 03:52:05,970
So I appreciate that.

4938
03:52:06,610 --> 03:52:07,670
Yeah, but...

4939
03:52:07,670 --> 03:52:08,170
Well, yeah.

4940
03:52:08,310 --> 03:52:08,610
Fun stream!

4941
03:52:08,610 --> 03:52:09,210
Thank you, thank you.

4942
03:52:09,210 --> 03:52:10,050
Thank you, thank you, big chuggers.

4943
03:52:11,990 --> 03:52:12,390
And...

4944
03:52:13,830 --> 03:52:14,230
Q97JW0ARF.

4945
03:52:14,310 --> 03:52:15,290
Welcome to membership to Akku!

4946
03:52:15,850 --> 03:52:16,590
And next time...

4947
03:52:16,590 --> 03:52:17,470
What does that mean, K-Barn?

4948
03:52:17,490 --> 03:52:18,070
I'm scared.

4949
03:52:18,590 --> 03:52:19,390
I'm scared.

4950
03:52:20,650 --> 03:52:21,450
I'm scared.

4951
03:52:23,990 --> 03:52:24,790
Thank you!

4952
03:52:26,030 --> 03:52:26,550
Thank you.

4953
03:52:26,690 --> 03:52:26,990
Thank you.

4954
03:52:27,130 --> 03:52:28,230
I had a productive morning at work.

4955
03:52:28,310 --> 03:52:29,170
Thanks for listening to you.

4956
03:52:29,910 --> 03:52:30,670
Thanks, guys.

4957
03:52:31,250 --> 03:52:31,730
Two!

4958
03:52:32,710 --> 03:52:33,490
Thanks, try for this!

4959
03:52:34,530 --> 03:52:35,290
Thank you, guys.

4960
03:52:35,430 --> 03:52:36,130
Stay dangerous.

4961
03:52:38,370 --> 03:52:39,750
I'm not streaming tomorrow.

4962
03:52:39,990 --> 03:52:40,730
So you got...

4963
03:52:40,730 --> 03:52:42,670
If I see you on Sunday...

4964
03:52:42,670 --> 03:52:43,650
I'll see you Sunday.

4965
03:52:43,990 --> 03:52:45,650
But it will be a...

4966
03:52:45,650 --> 03:52:47,690
Collab, so...

4967
03:52:50,310 --> 03:52:50,790
So...

4968
03:52:51,470 --> 03:52:51,950
Maybe...

4969
03:52:51,950 --> 03:52:53,870
Less talking with you guys.

4970
03:52:54,410 --> 03:52:55,150
Thanks for the stream!

4971
03:52:55,410 --> 03:52:56,250
Is it done because of work?

4972
03:52:56,350 --> 03:52:57,030
No worries!

4973
03:52:57,770 --> 03:52:58,870
Welcome back, Freeman.

4974
03:52:59,890 --> 03:53:01,750
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

4975
03:53:01,930 --> 03:53:02,710
Thank you so much.

4976
03:53:03,390 --> 03:53:04,170
400K soon!

4977
03:53:06,650 --> 03:53:07,930
Fact yourself, thank you for the...

4978
03:53:09,470 --> 03:53:10,790
Oh my gosh.

4979
03:53:10,910 --> 03:53:12,390
Couple your profile picture.

4980
03:53:12,990 --> 03:53:14,410
The lonely Gengar.

4981
03:53:17,390 --> 03:53:19,190
I don't know what game yet with Nimi.

4982
03:53:20,030 --> 03:53:21,450
I gotta figure something out.

4983
03:53:22,810 --> 03:53:25,470
But after we played the Emissary Zero...

4984
03:53:25,470 --> 03:53:26,930
All of us together...

4985
03:53:26,930 --> 03:53:28,310
Nimi was like...

4986
03:53:28,310 --> 03:53:29,550
I really like those...

4987
03:53:29,550 --> 03:53:30,750
These like...

4988
03:53:30,750 --> 03:53:31,630
Kind of goofy...

4989
03:53:31,630 --> 03:53:32,670
Stupid horror games.

4990
03:53:32,850 --> 03:53:33,170
I was like...

4991
03:53:33,170 --> 03:53:33,790
Me too!

4992
03:53:35,190 --> 03:53:36,990
And since we have our...

4993
03:53:36,990 --> 03:53:38,050
Our collab...

4994
03:53:38,570 --> 03:53:40,090
Cover coming out soon...

4995
03:53:40,090 --> 03:53:41,050
I thought that...

4996
03:53:41,050 --> 03:53:43,570
We could do something...

4997
03:53:43,570 --> 03:53:44,090
Just...

4998
03:53:44,090 --> 03:53:44,750
Hormie!

4999
03:53:45,510 --> 03:53:46,450
Johnny, thank you for the 5th!

5000
03:53:46,530 --> 03:53:47,230
Thank you!

5001
03:53:48,070 --> 03:53:48,590
Okay!

5002
03:53:49,170 --> 03:53:51,770
Well, you guys have a wonderful rest...

5003
03:53:51,770 --> 03:53:53,490
Of your day or night...

5004
03:53:53,490 --> 03:53:54,850
Or whatever time it is for you...

5005
03:53:56,130 --> 03:53:56,490
And...

5006
03:53:57,070 --> 03:53:57,430
Um...

5007
03:53:57,430 --> 03:53:58,050
What was I gonna say?

5008
03:53:58,230 --> 03:53:58,410
Oh!

5009
03:53:58,570 --> 03:54:00,070
Enjoy your Saturday...

5010
03:54:00,070 --> 03:54:01,410
If you have Saturday off...

5011
03:54:01,410 --> 03:54:02,590
Get some rest...

5012
03:54:02,590 --> 03:54:02,950
And...

5013
03:54:02,950 --> 03:54:04,350
Chill and relax...

5014
03:54:04,350 --> 03:54:05,530
And have a good time...

5015
03:54:05,530 --> 03:54:06,010
Taste himself...

5016
03:54:06,010 --> 03:54:06,730
Thank you so much for the 5th!

5017
03:54:06,730 --> 03:54:07,470
Good to do that girl!

5018
03:54:08,150 --> 03:54:09,730
And I will see you guys...

5019
03:54:09,730 --> 03:54:10,930
When I see you...

5020
03:54:10,930 --> 03:54:11,310
Next!

5021
03:54:11,310 --> 03:54:11,430
Next!

5022
03:54:11,850 --> 03:54:12,850
Once upon a time!

5023
03:54:14,150 --> 03:54:14,630
Iってらっしゃい!

5024
03:54:14,870 --> 03:54:15,350
Iってらっしゃい!

5025
03:54:15,450 --> 03:54:16,190
Thank you guys!

5026
03:54:16,450 --> 03:54:17,070
Bye bye!

5027
03:54:17,390 --> 03:54:18,630
Bye bye bye bye bye bye!

5028
03:54:18,630 --> 03:54:19,830
Bye bye bye bye bye!
