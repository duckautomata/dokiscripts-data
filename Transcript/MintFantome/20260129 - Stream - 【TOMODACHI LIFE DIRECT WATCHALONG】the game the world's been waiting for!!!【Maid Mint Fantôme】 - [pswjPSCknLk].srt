1
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,290
I'm having breakfast.

2
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,350
Never forgive you, Nintendo.

3
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,550
Why is it so early?

4
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,870
You know what's funny is?

5
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,010
It's not even like...

6
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,350
It's only like an hour earlier than what I usually wake up.

7
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,730
I'm being dramatic.

8
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,010
I'm being dramatic.

9
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,990
But okay, I was working.

10
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,050
until 3 a.m.

11
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,010
last night, so...

12
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,010
You have to forgive me.

13
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,130
Vicky!

14
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,670
Ochu, Uma!

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,590
I was gonna raid you!

16
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,630
Good morning, Minky.

17
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,190
Good morning, you think Mike Tyson's house!

18
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,010
Good morning, Minto and I was like you.

19
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,290
It was worth getting up at 6.30 a.m.

20
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,010
I don't think so.

21
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,560
Good morning, Vito.

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Can you see it too that you're really gifted?

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,700
Morning!

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,360
If you need more sleep, you can use my lap.

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,660
Oh my gosh, lap pillow offer?

26
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
Let's go.

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,240
Guys, this is Tomodachi Live!

28
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,780
We willed this into existence, remember?

29
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,860
This is huge.

30
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,680
This.

31
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,020
Tomodachi Live, hi.

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,680
What was I gonna say?

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
I don't remember.

34
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,920
Oh, I remember what I was gonna say.

35
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:27,580
I was gonna say, oh my gosh, so many things have been, like,
happening with, like, my favorite series is, like, the Fatal

36
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:33,080
Frame and Silent Hill F Collab.

37
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm like, whoa.

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,900
I called Silent Hill F.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Fatal Frame for so long, I willed that into existence too.

40
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,960
I willed Silent Hill F and Fatal Frame because I kept
calling it Silent.

41
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,380
I mean, I kept calling it Fatal Frame.

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,160
Silent Hill Frame, exactly.

43
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,280
My boss, we are very cold, can you let us in?

44
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,780
You're literally on my couch, what are you talking about?

45
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,520
We're like so far apart though.

46
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,520
Holy moly, I thank you guys for all the super chats.

47
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,200
Thank you.

48
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,580
Better use $10 of my train ticket.

49
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,420
Train was an hour late?

50
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,300
Holy cow.

51
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,080
I am seated.

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,840
Silent Hill F is closer to Siren than it is to Fatal Frame.

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,760
You have to understand, I called it fatal frame when it was
before anyone had played it because of the visuals alone

54
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:50,440
please understand it's not because of how the game is at all
it's just the visual next to big ibu plush yeah that's

55
00:04:50,440 --> 00:05:03,320

What is Tomodachi life in Japanese?

59
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,140
Is it still Tomodachi life?

60
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,810
Don't forget to two times a stream.

61
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,290
You're right, you're right.

62
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,370
Whoa, we have, we still have 10 minutes.

63
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,370
Playback.

64
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,570
Two times.

65
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:55,850
What?

66
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,410
There's a four times!

67
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,510
What does that even benefit?

68
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,090
What does that even benefit?

69
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,530
I don't know, let me turn off the comments on.

70
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,550
There you go.

71
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,750
Only for premium.

72
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,790
Oops.

73
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,470
Thanks for the voice pack.

74
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,730
I nearly died of a heart attack.

75
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,250
It was great.

76
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:18,710
Couple.

77
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:26,770
I want to say about the voice packs though, I think like, I
mean, obviously in the future I'm going to have a section

78
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,510
that says like, what name would you like me to use?

79
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,110
in it.

80
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,710
It was an oversight on my part.

81
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,370
I apologize.

82
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:41,610
Some people wrote like in the the request area like please
refer to me as blah blah blah or this will be for blah blah

83
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,670
blah so please refer to the name there.

84
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,970
But like ultimately there was no way of me knowing.

85
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:55,970
There was like actually no way of me knowing unless somebody
wrote it because all that all that I was provided was like

86
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:05,490
the name of the name of the person that like the legal name
so i'm really sorry if that was like a jump scare i'm so

87
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:15,770
sorry i boo afterlife i boo dachi after life seems too
fitting picking up early on my birthday bane happy birthday

88
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,650
i'm gonna sleep after this too little nap

89
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:41,250
Minto knows people's legal names Yeah, but I do not see I've
literally have forgotten Everything I remember if I wrote If

90
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:48,330
I recorded for your name And what it was Like if you told me
your YouTube name Or your Twitter name But

91
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,300
But for if it's your legal name I completely forgot No No

92
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,390
She does not perceive...

93
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,830
Yeah, don't spend...

94
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,530
I'm literally...

95
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,970
What if YouTube is a legal name?

96
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,650
Your real name is Ducky.

97
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,310
Like, it's funny because I'll record something and I'll use
the person's legal name because, like, if I'm recording a

98
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,810
voiceback, I want to...

99
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,050
I want to, like, you know, personalize it so I try to
include a name at all.

100
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,750
But...

101
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,370
It's funny because I won't know it's somebody until I see
like their tweet later and they'll be like, oh my gosh I

102
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,010
asked Minto to say this and she did and I'll be like, oh
that was for you.

103
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,450
Why didn't you write your name?

104
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,310
Why didn't you tell me it was for you?

105
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,550
Please it's It's the big day.

106
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,570
I'm so happy for you.

107
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,490

How am I supposed to know it's Yu-Gi-Oh!

110
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,550
How am I supposed to say?

111
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,210
Not that I'm not gonna like, you know, make it very
exciting.

112
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,070
Like, you know, I put my full everything into each one.

113
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,210
But I want to be like, oh my gosh, this is for show and so.

114
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,310
Makes me excited too.

115
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,530

So nice.

134
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,400
It's really late in JP time too though.

135
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,260
It's 11.

136
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,720
Oh, you're right.

137
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,600
It's 11 p.m.

138
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,540
It's not prime time at all in JP.

139
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,260
Crazy.

140
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,120
Nintendo Direct Watch Along back in 2024 was my first V2 and
V2 over stream.

141
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,660
That would have been a member for a year.

142
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh my gosh.

143
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,040
It got six Vs.

144
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,260
It's so funny doing these directs, right?

145
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,200
These direct watch-a-logs.

146
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,260
Cheek-up, thank you!

147
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,080
Thank you so much for the gift.

148
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,930
I guess they were trying to hit as many time zones as
possible then.

149
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,370
They're like, Come on, West Coasters.

150
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,870
You can wake up at 6 a.m.

151
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,050
You gotta get to work anyway!

152
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,570
Hmm.

153
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,150
Alright, Japan, stay up.

154
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,670
Look alive, look alive.

155
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,750
Minito's stream while working makes the morning better.

156
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,050
Good morning, Minito.

157
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,170
Bring back the concert minigame.

158
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,050
Am I laughing as you were?

159
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,630
Right!

160
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,290
Can't complain about waking up to Minito.

161
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,110
Would you call the concert a minigame, though?

162
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,590
I'm really curious what kind of features they'll add.

163
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,010
I love Tomodachi.

164
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:10,510
life i love tomodachi life i love tomodachi life hawaiians
out here not asleep and not awake oh my gosh there's

165
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:20,030
gameplay meytopia creator in this game oh yeah that's
another big thing

166
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,190
So...

167
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,730
Yeah.

168
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,930
If you love Tomodachi life so much, why don't you marry it?

169
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,410
I'll marry Snake in the game.

170
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,110
I don't know.

171
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,110
Your streams control my sleep schedule.

172
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,810
Maybe this will fix my sleep schedule, so I'm not asleep at
3 a.m.

173
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,030

In Tomodachi life, living your life.

186
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,890
Your experience can differ based on the means you created
residents.

187
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,090
Let's see how you could be living the dream.

188
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,890
Oh yeah, getting a whole bowl of ramen from the vending
machine.

189
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,250
We'll begin by creating the first resident.

190
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:48,670
Yippee!

191
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,010
There are two main ways to make residents.

192
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,070
Get help?

193
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,130
You could start by answering questions about their facial
features.

194
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:55,770
Oh.

195
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,690
by creating each part individually.

196
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,750
Getting help from the...

197
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,330
Wait, what?

198
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,350
From scratch.

199
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,250
Let's try creating a college student.

200
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,030
She'll appear as a character throughout the direct.

201
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,670
From face types.

202
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,910
This is all the same.

203
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,890
Oh, new hairstyles.

204
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,790
Well, some new hairstyles.

205
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,670
Okay.

206
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,810
Sub-color.

207
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,150
Oh, wait, I can make my own hair color.

208
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,130
There are so many parts.

209
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:37,810
including ones unique to this game get help you can even
choose the shape of ears oh my god that's me you can adjust

211
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:56,810

212
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,590
My name is Angie.

00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,610
It's nice to meet you.

214
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,030
Then answer some questions about their personality.

215
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,610
Oh, my gosh.

216
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,490
And...

217
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,110
Everyone, meet Angie.

218
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:07,570
Angie!

219
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,570
An outgoing, friendly college student.

220
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,270
Sociable.

221
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,430
Hey, there.

222
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,470
It's nice to meet you.

223
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,050
Leader.

224
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:15,730
Leader?

225
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,290
I'm Angie.

226
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,770
I can't wait to start living here.

227
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,210
Oh, the voice is the exact same.

228
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,950
It's so good.

229
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,610
Oh, it looks like something is clouding Angie's mind.

230
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:24,990
Uh-uh.

231
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:25,930
What's up?

232
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,910
We can make mean to you!

233
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,310
How about some flan?

234
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,450
Yum.

235
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,270
Yum.

236
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,690
I'm gonna have every girl crush ever.

237
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,370
You'll need to take care of your me at the start.

238
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,690
It's so lonely.

239
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,290
on Yumean Island.

240
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,970
Kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies too.

241
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,270
I wish there were other people here with me.

242
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,250
Ah, yeah, about that.

243
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,670
The island is pretty barren at first.

244
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:10,970
Oh, wow.

245
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,730
Angie needs some company, so let's create some new island
residents.

246
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,130
It feels small, no?

247
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,070
Is that just me?

248
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,490
It feels small.

249
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,890
First up is her childhood pal, Jess.

250
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:23,710
Jess.

251
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,730
Also Patrick.

252
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,850
He's kind.

253
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,530
And kind of aloof.

254
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,730
Dr. Winters.

255
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,970
Did you like your mentor?

256
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,550
She did.

257
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,170
Imagine making your professor.

258
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,890
A barista at the local cafe.

259
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,170
Imagine making your professor at this game.

260
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,250
One of Angie's friends from work.

261
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,590
Oh my god, the hairstyle is so cute.

262
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,530
Hugh Morris.

263
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,150
A jester and jokester.

264
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,110
Nobody talks about Hugh Morris.

265
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:51,970
Oh my god.

266
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,170
Angie's childhood teddy bear.

267
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,010
Just a bear.

268
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:03,090
You can even make me characters by combining different
features or by using face paint.

269
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,110
Oh my god, yes!

270
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,350
Oh, the customization.

271
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,810
As more residents appear, the island will grow.

272
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,710
Oh, nice!

273
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,310
Even if the residents are friends in the real world, they
won't know each other here.

274
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,750
At least at first.

275
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,950
There needs to be an opportunity for them to get acquainted.

276
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,350
D.

277
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,890
Let's try bringing Crystal a little closer to Jess.

278
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,830
Oh wow, you can like actually control where they go and
stuff.

279
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,370
Oh my gosh.

280
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,030
I can force my OTP to happen.

281
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,490
You're Crystal.

282
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,730
I'm Jess.

283
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,830
And now they know each other.

284
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,370
Getting familiar.

285
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,110
Once this happens, the mees will start interacting on their
own.

286
00:19:52,250 --> 00:20:02,210
And depending on where you drop a me, I could force my OTPs
this is amazing different things might play out what is

287
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:12,550
going on why are you doing that hmm Angie what happened big
pause Osla I think dr. Winters and humorous would be best

288
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:23,110
friends love that idea what should we talk about to help
them get along so this is similar you could type something

289
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,050
Monster Truck.

290
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:27,910
Monster Trucks.

291
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,010
You can type anything!

292
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,670
Oh no.

293
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,470
Oh no.

294
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,730
Hey Morris, say hello to Dr. Winters.

295
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,170
Oh no.

296
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,750
Dr. Winters, this is T.

297
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:38,970
Morris.

298
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,710
Oh no.

299
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,190
Do you feel like talking about?

300
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,170
Monster Trucks?

301
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,670
Monster Trucks.

302
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,770
Tell me, Dr. Winters, did you see that report on TV
yesterday?

303
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,750
The one about Monster Trucks?

304
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,870
I've been itching to talk to someone about it.

305
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,870
Oh, no.

306
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,290
Oh, I was going to say, it was so boring that I fell asleep.

307
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,430
I guess I'm just not that interested in monster trucks.

308
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,490
I like the way he says it.

309
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,530
Monster trucks.

310
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,410
Monster trucks.

311
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,250
Oh, that reminds me.

312
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,850
Apparently, Dr. Winters made a cameo in the report.

313
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,610
Is that right?

314
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:25,590
Whoa.

315
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,010
You know, maybe we do have a lot to talk about after all.

316
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,090
I bet we could be good friends.

317
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,090
They hit it off.

318
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,970
Just barely, though.

319
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,770
On this island, time passes in the same way as the real
world.

320
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,470
So, even when you're not playing, the Mies will live their
lives of their own accord.

321
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,370
Can it tell you what?

322
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,870
Sure, I can get them out of it.

323
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,930
What is it?

324
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,910
Oh my God, fateful encounter.

325
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:04,170
sorry my mind was somewhere else no it's my fault Patrick so
dreamy

326
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:22,890

327
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,330
Angie falling in love.

328
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,110
Hum, how curious.

329
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,650
Hum.

330
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,370
Anyway.

331
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,170
Let's introduce some of the shops that bring the island to
life.

332
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,750
First up is the food mart.

333
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,870
Fresh kingdom.

334
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,910
Shipping, I know.

335
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,870
It's going to be awesome.

336
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,270
Oh, cute.

337
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,550
The standard menus.

338
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,150
Avocado.

339
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,430
Some days, though, you might get some rather unusual
options.

340
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,490
String cheese.

341
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,970
Oh my gosh, please don't spoil what happens when they have a
favorite.

342
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,510
I want to see it.

343
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,650
This is the clothing shop.

344
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,070
Clothing!

345
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,590
And where?

346
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,750
You'll find a dolly dress outfit?

347
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,730
A sunny side up outfit.

348
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,070
So cute.

349
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,770
Anything clothes like a hot dog costume.

350
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,170
HOT DOG!

351
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,730
If you want to change up your look, head to this shop.

Creating islands like these are possible with just your
imagination.

403
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,800

dreams.

Sporting a smug stance.

416
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,270
If it isn't Patrick.

417
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,630

Socializing skills and crossed arms at the ready.

421
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,110
Hi, my name is alien.

422
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,910
These tiny habits are called little quirks.

423
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,310
Little.

424
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,870
Oh, you just just float to me characters.

425
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,770
Wait, that's so fun.

426
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,150
You can kind of like customize their personality, like more
specifically.

427
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,390
The little quirks can differ.

428
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,730
What?

429
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,550
He's so baby girl.

430
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,810
for example.

431
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,410
Getting quirky.

432
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,890
Not the cool, me and Jess are not getting along.

433
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,910
You can also gift them with phrases.

434
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:51,550
Yeah!

435
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,050
I usually end up crying when I go to the movie.

436
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,930
I don't know.

437
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:03,310
Some other little quirks include wiping away sweat or
tossing and turning while asleep.

438
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,090
Try finding the little quirks that match each me.

439
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:12,250
It's so, it's so the same game.

440
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,150
Why so glum?

441
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:13,850
But better!

442
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,710
Did he reject you?

443
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:17,570
No!

444
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,490
Give it up!

445
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:21,890
No!

446
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,330
No way!

447
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,490
This is so sad.

448
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,870
Let's get Hugh in here.

449
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,430

00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,970
Oh my gosh, Meets can live together?

533
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,250
Ultra friends.

534
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,590
Oh, right.

535
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,350
Angie and Mocha go way back.

536
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,150
So why not reminisce?

537
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,650
The voice is so baby.

538
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,330
Let's have them talk about when the two of you first met.

539
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,750
Type about blinking.

540
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,870
You're right.

541
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,990
I'll go talk to her.

542
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,590
Can I have a word?

543
00:33:51,730 --> 00:34:00,580
up mocha well if the two of us live together what's
something you think we'd enjoy doing every day

544
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:17,970

talking about when we met oh my god they're so insane let's

545
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:24,410

546
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,010
Whoa.

547
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,570
Looks like they're really living the dream.

548
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,210
Living the dream.

549
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,830
Oh, Tomodachi Life Living the dream.

550
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,570
Angie looks much happier too.

551
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,290
Aww.

552
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:42,430
Here in this big old house, up to eight residents can live
together.

553
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,930
Oh my gosh, apartment complex.

554
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:49,590
You'll be able to see different sides of the me's when
they're under the same roof.

555
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:59,790
On three, say the first name that comes to mind Wait, that's
so much more like interactive interactivity between

556
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,230
everybody.

557
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,390
One, two, three, me.

558
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,310
And that's that.

559
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,410
We're at the concert!

560
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,010
The me on this island will live out their lives however they
so choose.

561
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,390
No more concert hall?

562
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,390
When is the game coming out?

563
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:15,630
Oh?

564
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,830
When is the game coming out?

565
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,990
They might befriend someone.

566
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,710
When is the game coming?

567
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,710
Live together.

568
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,230
Always handling the clean up.

569
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,610
Or even fall in love.

570
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,130
Oh, the marriage.

571
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,470
See how their relationships change.

572
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,170
Baby.

573
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,450
Help them out where you can.

574
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,470
Oh, my God.

575
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,030
Rag doll.

576
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,090
There's other stores that they didn't highlight, it seems.

577
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,110
Like, my treasure.

578
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:44,650
I don't know.

579
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,670
That concludes a basic overview of Tomodachi life.

580
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,830
Living the dream.

581
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,430
Marriage.

582
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,510
What did you think?

583
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,510
Soon, it'll be your turn to create your own island.

584
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,170
Soon?

585
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,450
How soon?

586
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,370
What kinds of me characters will you make?

587
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,210
Tell us the date.

588
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,170
Tomodachi Life.

589
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,250
Living the dream launches on the Nintendo Switch system
April 16th.

590
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,510
April 16th!

591
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:18,410
The game will also be compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2
system.

592
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,370
Oh my gosh, I was worried I would have to get a Nintendo
Switch 2.

593
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,170
Why did I say the full name, full legal name?

594
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,830
Yippee!

595
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,720
Oh my gosh.

596
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,920
There's so much to it.

597
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,180
There's so much to it.

598
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,700
There's so much to it.

599
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,600
There's so much.

600
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,840
Wait, how long was that?

601
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,640
That was like 20 minutes long.

602
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,990
That could have been a normal direct, everybody.

603
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,870
This all could have been in a normal direct.

604
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,430
Actually, I guess it would have taken up half the direct
time, but...

605
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,050
Hold on.

606
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,670
I want to go see... Wait, let's see.

607
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,090
Hold on.

608
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,090
I want to go see a big map first, because...

609
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,250
Wait, like here.

610
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:14,850
No.

611
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,590
I'm seeing houses.

612
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,370
I'm seeing the news.

613
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,850
I wonder if we don't get the concert.

614
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,770
Maybe they'll add it in later.

615
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:34,990
you yeah but i'm pretty bummed about the concert hall

616
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:54,060
post launch updates i hope so i really hope so because that
was such a big part of the first game i'm trying to think of

617
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,920
features from the first game that they didn't show Tomodachi
lifeboads, ah, thank you.

618
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,880
Horse, wharf, jump, thank you.

619
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:08,020
Yeah, there was like the voting thing where you like said
like, raise your hand if you love pizza.

620
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,480
And like they would raise their hand.

621
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,280
There was that.

622
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,780
But we did see like the bowling thing.

623
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,880
I guess it's more like random events that happened
throughout the island rather than like a full section.

624
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,400
There was like the rat battles at the fountain in the
evening.

625
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,380
um so i'm probably probably that there's like random events
that happen throughout the island that they just didn't

626
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:40,620
feature um like the bowling that they showed randomly and
the dreams remember the the tomo the me's used to have

627
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:47,500
dreams and they would be like super wacky and you would get
items from them um with all the customization options vids

628
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,520
island is gonna be nothing but battle gear characters

629
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:58,960
featuring dante from the devil may cry series Corsat, thank
you so much for the 50 gifts and thank you.

630
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

631
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,220
They did say this is a basic overview.

632
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,660
True, true.

633
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,900
The island customization is like crazy.

634
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,300
Wait, what'd they show?

635
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,240
Uh, where they're like, you can make your island look like
this or like this or like this.

636
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,580
Like these, these new segments are the exact same as before.

637
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,240
It's so good.

638
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,960
Yeah, the build.

639
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,520
So...

640
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,960
Like so cute!

641
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,060
So cute!

642
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,100
And there's still the restaurant they didn't even show.

643
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,640
There's the nuts size area.

644
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,600
Tomoria.

645
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,300
That stayed the same.

646
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,060
I'm so happy.

647
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,920
But they didn't show that off at all either.

648
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:49,980
So...

649
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,840
We can have Densetsu and Tomodachi live.

650
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,360
Yeah!

651
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,540
We will!

652
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:10,100
i love this i love the pet that you can draw i'm gonna draw
ibu and take you guys on walks and the customization looks

653
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:21,840
really great for faces and stuff so so far it has very much
the spirit of the original so that's all i can ask for

654
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,140
Walkies!

655
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,820
Walkies!

656
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,840
Picking music in preference so good.

657
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,260
Yeah!

658
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,300
So much customization!

659
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,780
So much customization!

660
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,720
Thank you, stream schedule for the entire back half of
April.

661
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,200
Luckily, the entire end of April, I'm free.

662
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,240
Yeah!

663
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,480
Woo!

664
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,730
Yay!

665
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,310
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

666
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,670
Metal Gear Drama on the island.

667
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,990
I'm going to be shoving Ocelot and snaking each other's
faces.

668
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,670
Anyways, guys.

669
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,570
Well, that was fun.

670
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,550
That was a lot of fun.

671
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,130
Pomodachi Life Living the Dream.

672
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,450
Coming out April 16th, was it?

673
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:26,870
16th?

674
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,710
Living the dream launches on the Nintendo Switch system
April 16th!

675
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,190
April 16th!

676
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,270
Spoon for the Mindo helps the 70 hour work week go down!

677
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,490
Oh my gosh!

678
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,790
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the awkward soup!

679
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,970
But 70 hour work week!

680
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,450
Try and take it easy when you can.

681
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,170
Try and take it easy when you can.

682
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,870
Thank you for the watch along Mindo!

683
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,610
Thank you!

684
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,290
No, you don't need a Switch 2.

685
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,430
You can play on Switch 1 also.

686
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:13,030
I hope they all have the same features the Switch 2 game and
the regular Switch game I hope I hope

687
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:24,100
I don't want to have to get a Switch 2 yet I haven't had a
reason to yet so

688
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:37,680
graphics might be worse on one um do you see how they look i
think uh i think we're okay i think we don't need optimal

689
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,260
graphics for uh for tomodachi live live in the dream that's
just my opinion

690
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:56,540
in fact it looks the exact same of how it did on the ds so
how big of a crash out would you have if you make a metal

691
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,020
gear island and random Naomi shows up, then very awes a lot.

692
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,060
Everybody would be bisexual, so it would just enhance the
drama.

693
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,440
Anybody could get with anybody.

694
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,300
Oh my goodness.

695
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,820
The options are, it's a whole buffet, baby.

696
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,140
The drama is overflowing.

697
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,200
How many me's can we add on the island?

698
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,260
I don't think it's sad.

699
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't think it's sad.

700
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,100
I think what the 3DS game was like 100 though or something.

701
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,560
So, I mean, that's a lot of me's.

702
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,200
100 me's is a lot of me's.

703
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,260
It looks like you can make a really large island.

704
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,360
Yeah, I'm trying to find.

705
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,140
I was trying to find the, uh, the, how they customize.

706
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:08,140
the island but so much happened in such a short amount of
time I couldn't I couldn't find it I love that they're just

707
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:22,580
like yeah you could make a clown and you can make a bear you
can get lion oh it was like here right yeah here it was here

708
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,960
yeah like these these are possible that's what I just said
these

709
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,340
I'm so in tuned.

710
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,580
Oh, yeah, let's look at here.

711
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,620
I see a bunch of, like, houses.

712
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,740
I don't get to watch you live much since I'm from Europe,
but I do enjoy your content, so I want to give some

713
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,620
appreciation while I can.

714
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,640
Oh, my gosh, a cutie.

715
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,440
Thank you.

716
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,280
Thank you.

717
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,020
Thank you.

718
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,460
Thanks for watching the boss when you can.

719
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,040
I really appreciate it.

720
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,100
Thank you.

721
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,700
Thank you.

722
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,700
One thing I was also hoping for, this is just me being
selfish, is, you know how there was the Ferris wheel.

723
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,460
There's also, like, there's, like, other areas, like an
observatory and stuff.

724
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:24,860
I think, though, with the extra customization, you kind of
build your own areas, if that makes sense.

725
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,800
So before you had, like, the observation area, I think
there's probably going to be ways to build that into the

726
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:31,980
game.

727
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,400
See, there's, like, a lighthouse there.

728
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:42,800
there might even be like events at the lighthouse like we're
not we don't we have no idea yet so um and it did show like

729
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:52,040
you picked up we picked up the guy and put him by like the
sprinkler and something happened you know so i think that um

730
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:59,760
i think that there's more obviously there's more that they
didn't show us i'm just like the concert hall i feel like

731
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:12,980
they would have shown that off was maybe that i don't know
no i want my knees to sing a musical so good would you

732
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,360
populate the island with your favorite version of each
character or introduce multiple snakes ocelots for maximum

733
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:26,880
drama i mean i guess we could do like an old ocelot and then
a young ocelot and then snake has to choose between the two

734
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:34,520
that would be drama the jp director has different characters
and stuff.

735
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,780
Oh, okay, well, I'll watch that later.

736
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,620
I'm gonna go take a nap now.

737
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,600
Actually, I'm gonna set up my waiting room for my stream
later, and then I'm gonna go take a nap.

738
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,280
Thank you guys for hanging out with me for the Tomodachi
Life Direct.

739
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,200
It was fun!

740
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,100

741
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,280
And I'll see you guys hopefully later for my next stream.

742
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,460

743
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,880

Nap time, nap time, nap time.

746
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,240
Put my glasses back on.

747
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,580
I'm going to snooze for a bit.

748
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,280
I can even snooze until it's actually my usual time that I
wake up.

749
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,760
Couldn't happen, Minto.

750
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,760
Back to not holding up international business.

751
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,220
Oh, that sounds important.

752
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,380
Bye-bye.

753
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,460
Thank you, everybody.

754
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,440
Thank you, thank you.

755
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,040
Bye-bye.
