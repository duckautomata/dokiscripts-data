00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,570
Hello, hello, hello,

2
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,360
hello, welcome in, welcome in, welcome in,

3
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:43,590
welcome in, oh, sorry, here's my mouse, welcome back to Silent Hill, if, wait, hold on, I didn't actually, I didn't actually do any, like, sound stuff, I just started streaming, I forgot, professional,

4
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,340
Professional streamer.

5
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,660
I sound quiet.

6
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,200
I should sound the exact same.

7
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,440
That's not the thing that I was talking about.

8
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,860
Thank you for the great concert.

9
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
I also started painting a figure.

10
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,540
The game sounds louder.

11
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,180
Wait, what?

12
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,120
Really?

13
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,600
Really?

14
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,560
Is that better?

15
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,820
I don't know.

16
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,360
I don't...

17
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,980
I shouldn't sound.

18
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,680
I shouldn't sound.

19
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't tell.

20
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,440
What's it called?

21
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,400
The little...

22
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,020
Oh, here we go.

23
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,520
It's better now?

24
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:45,920
Okay.

25
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,740
Am I always quiet?

26
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm not good at this kind of stuff.

27
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,600
Like the hills.

28
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,260
You're silent.

29
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:30,120
is low but that's old i'm i'm better now right don't apologize thank you i'm usually perfect okay cool i have to max your streams seriously but okay here i'll give you guys like kind of uh hold on so what i just sounded like I always try to hit like the sweet spot in OBS.

30
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,340
Hold on, I'm saving a picture.

31
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,300
OBS.

32
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:47,360
When I do sound, I try to hit like right in the middle of the yellow so I'm not like peaking in red.

33
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,780
That sweet spot, I feel like that's a sweet spot, no?

34
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,460
Huh.

35
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,050
You need some headroom for screaming.

36
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,370
I know, that's how I feel.

37
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,010
Sometimes I'm, like, really quiet.

38
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,250
Sometimes I'm quiet, but sometimes I get really...

39
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,250
Sometimes I get loud, so I try to, like...

40
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,210
Kind of keep a balance a little bit.

41
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,410
Hello.

42
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,350
I don't know.

43
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,010
I guess I could...

44
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,290
Hold on.

45
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:57,140
I guess I could afford to put my gains up a tiny bit for my mic one second listening to okay okay making Halloween cookies that sounds so awesome let's

46
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:21,660
test it here today and if this is if this sounds good I could keep it as like this okay dokey last time we ended we um we uh wrinkle got sent to hell and And, um, Sakuko, we locked her in the dark.

47
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,360
We locked her in my mine dungeon.

48
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,040
And, um, we are about to go into shoes.

49
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,540
Whatever is going on.

50
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,720
Whatever is going on with him.

51
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,480
That's where we last ended off.

52
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,710
So...

53
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,050
Actually, I also thought...

54
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,390
I want to change my costume today.

55
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,310
I don't know where my white costume went.

56
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,250
Why did my DLC get taken away from me?

57
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,490
Today we are bunny.

58
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,310
Guys, I have a confession.

59
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,190
Maybe other stuff on YouTube, like ads that make...

60
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,170
Wait, that's not live, make their videos as loud as possible without peaking.

61
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,470
Wait, what?

62
00:09:18,590 --> 00:10:19,430
that wait huh huh I don't understand sorry um okay I have a bit of a confession um I okay so the school was so scary and now I think okay here's like my issue with long horror games is eventually you're gonna get like kind of used to the atmosphere and then it becomes not so scary and then it just becomes more action and that's when it's like kind of boring for me i feel like horror games usually like like it's usually better the shorter they are when it turns into a chore i almost was just like i don't feel like i'm gonna But I almost,

63
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,830
I, I was like thinking the other day, I was just like, I'm just, I don't know.

64
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:35,770
I, I, the thing is, is I really like, I really like the atmosphere and I like so far what's been going on.

65
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:45,890
But I think, you know, I just, for me, truly, for like horror games, and I mean, Silent Hill has always been this way.

66
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,370
I just don't favor action in my horror games.

67
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,170
I prefer it to be more atmospheric than anything.

68
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:01,510
And I think this game has so many stinking monsters that you have to deal with in this game.

69
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,790
So, that's just my opinion.

70
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:17,890
Obviously, like, you know, if you prefer action in your horror games, that's totally cool for you.

71
00:11:17,950 --> 00:12:33,010
the enemies are just damaged sponges too yeah i saw i saw a tweet pop up in my timeline of someone being like if there is a story mode or story like yes i think is i think when i'm on a story mode for a game i shouldn't be dealing with souls bosses and i was like i think this has to do with silent hill i was like um not that i'm I haven't found it like super challenging it's just that I for horror I'm not wanting an action experience I'm wanting like to be immersed in the atmosphere and getting creeped out and everything so like I said I'm no quitter I'm not gonna drop the game but I'm just wanted to be honest with you guys kind of like my thoughts on on where i'm kind of standing like uh because i was i like i said i was pretty close to being like i don't think i'm gonna play it today i'm just not in the mood but at the same time at the same time i do want to see where it goes

72
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:47,350
so horror games shouldn't be longer than eight hours at most yeah see i i agree i agree i think Horror games in particular should be shorter.

73
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:55,090
Unless it's like kind of like, I guess, you know, there are some horror games where it's like they take on the action a little bit more.

74
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,590
Like, I guess like this.

75
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,870
But I don't know.

76
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:06,010
I think if your main focus is the horror and the atmosphere, shorter is way better.

77
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,490
Resident Evil 4 was way too long.

78
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,250
I don't even consider that.

79
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,690
Well, actually, one of the reasons I did not.

80
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:20,230
play Resident Evil for so long is because I always considered it an action series.

81
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,250
I did not think it was scary at all.

82
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,930
And so I wasn't interested.

83
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,750
And then Seven came out and I was like, oh, okay.

84
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,190
Okay.

85
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:30,930
Okay.

86
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,030
Yeah.

87
00:13:33,830 --> 00:14:12,400
I guess because Silent Hill is also like survival horror, it's kind of its own genre as well but at the same time the atmosphere in this game has been so good and now i'm just kind of feeling like i see an enemy and i'm like it's not so much that i'm like you know i don't know but yeah so that's just a kind of how I'm feeling at the moment.

88
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
You can run past the enemies if you want.

89
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,980
That's true, that's true.

90
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,280
And in some cases, you really have to.

91
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,960
Luckily, they don't, they kind of give up the chase pretty fast, so.

92
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,260
But I just wanted to kind of share where my brain was at with the game right now.

93
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,340
Like I said, I don't know.

94
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm like conflicted.

95
00:14:39,680 --> 00:15:35,940
I'm conflicted because I want to like it and I do but at the same time I'm just kind of like you'd probably like fatal frame I love fatal frame I love fatal frame actually uh Koei Tecmo they put out like a thing the other day being like we're looking for creators who would be interested in the fatal frame 2 remake and I sent in my information it was my first time ever doing that i've never had the chance to like you know when when companies like that are searching for creators in the past i was never able to and so this was my first time ever ever doing it so i was kind of like and i kept calling this game fatal frame anyway i love i really love fatal frame

96
00:15:41,180 --> 00:16:20,340
so yeah like i said i still want to finish this game but probably we'll just do i have a question because i know that this game requires multiple playthroughs should be scary when enemies show up not annoying or tiring yeah yeah i have a question for this for for like the second how many playthroughs do you have it requires four to five playthroughs oh what i thought it was like three two to three four to what the heck oh my gosh at least three okay that's what I was seeing was three

97
00:16:24,850 --> 00:17:10,150
um three minimum I had 30 I heard three to four oh for for the playthroughs is it something that like you know how when you for okay how do I explain um for some alternate endings to games you can just like watch like the ending on YouTube you know you can just look it up but for for this game do things change throughout the story like do things kind of like little are there little details that are different for those who know obviously oh it does stuff does change some of the cut scenes change Ah.

98
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,310
It changes some scenes.

99
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,450
Collectibles are different.

100
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,820
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

101
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,350
I see, I see.

102
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,790
Small changes.

103
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,130
They explicitly tell you stuff that they only hinted at previously.

104
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,290
Okay, okay, okay.

105
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,410
Interesting.

106
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,570
It is a big commitment, though.

107
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,710
It makes it tough as a streaming game.

108
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,930
It dies.

109
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,830
I'm not going to lie.

110
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,450
Let's get into it.

111
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,410
Okay, Shu, what do you got going on in here?

112
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,290
Wait, hold on.

113
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,540
That's my full health at the top.

114
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,620
I got four bandages.

115
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,140
This is lock.

116
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,660
Dodge.

117
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,540
Small.

118
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,300
Big.

119
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:04,960
Okay.

120
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,620
All right.

121
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,200
Oh.

122
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,420
See, I see you over there, and I'm like, gosh, dang it.

123
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,080
The medicine cabinet from Shoe's place.

124
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,540
Okie dokie.

125
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,840
That's okay.

126
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,620
That's right.

127
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:35,380
It's like these puzzly thingies again where we open stuff and then...

128
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,800
What is it?

129
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,280
Oh, this was the room.

130
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,840
That's right.

131
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,040
Where she like crossed out.

132
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,400
Rinko crossed out my picture.

133
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,700
In my times, games are simple with only one ending.

134
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,030
hating on multiple endings obviously i'm not even hating on i'm not even hating on having to

135
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:12,180
replay a game to get multiple endings oh oh my gosh oops wait that's not what i wanted to do wait how did i there we go yeah did

136
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,680
you come from oh okay no it's just it's just getting angry from behind.

137
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,260
I got it.

138
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,660
Yeah, get out of here.

139
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,140
Ugly.

140
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,460
Oh, wait.

141
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,260
Oh, no.

142
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,320
It's going to come back to life.

143
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,340
I got to get out of here.

144
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,520
There's so many enemies in this game.

145
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,860
Where are you going?

146
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:52,880
Sorry.

147
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm going to...

148
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,780
Okay, so this is where the red will shut.

149
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,460
Okay.

150
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,000
Okie dokie.

151
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,300
Where?

152
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,340
Right there?

153
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,130
It looks like it.

154
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,000
The music in this game is so good.

155
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,040
Wee!

156
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,800
Where are you leading me?

157
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,880
Ah, okay.

158
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
And this one changes it.

159
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,460
I wish there was a blue light room.

160
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,920
Sakuko's area.

161
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,440
It was so nice for that.

162
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,480
Why are my pigtails the most adorable thing ever?

163
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,900
Thanks, I think so too.

164
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,320
Silent Hill had multiple endings.

165
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,060
You know, I guess it was so long ago that I played Silent Hill.

166
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,260
I mean, I played three.

167
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,640
That was the last one I played.

168
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,400
And I think that was like...

169
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:32,400

Fun!

172
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,980
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

173
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,900
I don't want to get jump scared anymore.

174
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,480
I'm tired.

175
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,400
Where'd she go?

176
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,660
Where'd she go?

177
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,480
A freakazoid.

178
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,500
Any items?

179
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,240
Not that I can carry much.

180
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,320
Where'd she go?

181
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,300
Sorry, I know I keep checking the map over and over.

182
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm tired, boss.

183
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,260
Where'd she go?

184
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,060
She's not above.

185
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,580
Gamers don't look up?

186
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,910
Freakazoid bottom, right?

187
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,660
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

188
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,780
Oh wait, there's more?

189
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,560
No, that's a wall.

190
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,360
That is a wall, right?

191
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,480
It's a wall!

192
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,340
Drawing of a young Shimizu Hinako.

193
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,140
Tonari no Seki no Shimizu Hinako.

194
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,160
Baka.

195
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh, wasn't the- What was that?

196
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,120
Wait, what was that manga?

197
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,840
Tonari no Seki no something.

198
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,260
Oh, what was the guy's name?

199
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,340
Nice uniform, Hinako.

200
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
Something you could wear to a wedding.

201
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,560
What the...

202
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,480
Seki-kun!

203
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:15,780
Yeah!

204
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

205
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,740
Even if it was drawn by an elementary school student, it's still too bad.

206
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,580
Oh my gosh.

207
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,620
Don't quit your day job, Shu.

208
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,120
This is definitely drawn on purpose.

209
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,380
What?

210
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,640
I don't think it looks that bad.

211
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,540
I think it...

212
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,120
Actually, for elementary school, I think this looks really good.

213
00:23:40,140 --> 00:24:04,800
good there are all kinds of curses written on it such as stupid disgusting etc well actually it only says stupid and disgusting there is no etc this is a prized possession he hates me okay i'm ready to oh this thing is gonna jump at me

214
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,610
It's too quiet.

215
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,890
It's too quiet.

216
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,790
I think it's a coffee ground.

217
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,010
Sorry.

218
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:55,330
I got, there's like a local coffee place and they buy me and they added some new stuff.

219
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,630
And they wrote thank you on my...

220
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,790
Okay.

221
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,330
This is how I know it was made for me.

222
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,970
They wrote thank you on my cup.

223
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:08,970
But in the O of the thank you, they made it into a P sign.

224
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,310
And I was like, Metal Gear!

225
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,830
Why is it so quiet?

226
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,610
Okay, cool.

227
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,770
Okay, cool.

228
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,010
Okay, cool.

229
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,590
I'm barking, yes.

230
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,330
I gotta keep them away somehow.

231
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,790
Okay, prized possession.

232
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,030
Number two.

233
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,410
Oh, my shadow scared me!

234
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,830
I thought something was sneaking up behind me!

235
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,530
Oh, spooky scary!

236
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,530
Spooky scary.

237
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,960
What?

238
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,680
Why?

239
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,960
Why, all of a sudden?

240
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,600
Is it the one we saw from earlier?

241
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,560
Oh, okay.

242
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,160
Music disappears.

243
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,480
Okay.

244
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,300
I think it is.

245
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,580
The one from earlier.

246
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,420
Ooh.

247
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,560
Music is so creepy.

248
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,040
Ah!

249
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,940
Come here.

250
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,100
Come here.

251
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,500
And dodge!

252
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,510
And...

253
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,350
Uh-oh.

254
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,940
Oh shoot, wait.

255
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,680
Don't dodge the wrong way.

256
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,540
Don't kill me, please.

257
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,260
Oh, yikes, yikes, yikes.

258
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,520
Oops, wrong thing.

259
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,300
Wait, I meant to do this.

260
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,820
Oh, no, we got another one!

261
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,880
Oh, shoot.

262
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,130
I messed up.

263
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,250
I did a whoopsie.

264
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,390
Another?

265
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,890

Anything?

269
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,190
Oh, ah!

270
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,610
We were rewarded.

271
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,090
Wait, uh, I still have three.

272
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,550
It's not bad.

273
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,610
Yo-kang.

274
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,290
Nice.

275
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,590
I will eat that up.

276
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,280
You're not gonna like this next room though.

277
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,660
Oh, why?

278
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,960
Don't say that!

279
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,380

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,660
I was about to say I wish I could save!

282
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
The game just auto-saved for me.

283
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,680
Let's go.

284
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,440
Why am I not gonna like it?

285
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,290
Oh!

286
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,570
Squelchery.

287
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,090
Oh!

288
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,850
Whoa!

289
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,330
Is this a boss?

290
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,010
Uh-oh!

291
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,490
Whoa.

292
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,070
Let me see her face pretty.

293
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,850
Oh.

294
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,410
A baby.

295
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,810
Oh, boy.

296
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,750
Oh, defeat the monsters.

297
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:26,650
Great.

298
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,830
Love this.

299
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,970
I'll focus on that thing.

300
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:30,510
Never mind.

301
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:30,930
Ah!

302
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:31,690
Oh!

303
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,770
Never mind.

304
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,390
Does it explode?

305
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,550
Oh, it explodes into...

306
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,010
Oh, gosh.

307
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,510
Oh, no!

308
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,310
Please!

309
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,330
Um.

310
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,570
Wait, I want to focus on...

311
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,810
This thing is more... Wait, no, please.

312
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,390
This one.

313
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:47,890
There we go.

314
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,250
No!

315
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,610
Dodge!

316
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:51,650
Dodge!

317
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,090
Dodge!

318
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,320
Oh my god.

319
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,320
Uh, it keeps focusing... Okay, it's like focusing on both of them.

320
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

321
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,660
I just couldn't... Oh, geez.

322
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,020
Oh my gosh!

323
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,160
This is kind of brutal.

324
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,600
Okay.

325
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,490
Ooh, nice dodge.

326
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,630
Good job, man.

327
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,560
Um...

328
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,200
Oh.

329
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,620
Okay, I got it.

330
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,580
Oh, wait, was that not close enough to the...

331
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,760
Oh.

332
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

333
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,860
She's a big boy.

334
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,140
Oh, shoot!

335
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,020
Oh, geez.

336
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,060
Ouch, how much my arm!

337
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,200
Okay, come here.

338
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,840
Come here, nasty.

339
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,160
Okay, back.

340
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,260
Oh my gosh!

341
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,040
Ow!

342
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,340
Ow!

343
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,920
Oh, it got, like, cornered.

344
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,600
Oh my gosh.

345
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,640
Okay.

346
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,480
Ah, I tried!

347
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,580
I wasn't fast enough!

348
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,480
Okay, I can't see the other thing, please.

349
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,000
There we go.

350
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,640
Ugh!

351
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,440
Ugh!

352
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,080
Oh my gosh!

353
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,600
Nice sir!

354
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,710
Please die!

355
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,690
Please die.

356
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,170
Please die.

357
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:58,810
Ouchie ouch.

358
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,430
No more sanity!

359
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,270
Poker.

360
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,210
I am.

361
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,630
Ouchie ouchie!

362
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:08,690
Ouchie!

363
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,580
Maybe I can...

364
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,620
Oh, dang it.

365
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,280
Oh, geez.

366
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,800
Not good.

367
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,740
Not reading her inputs like at all.

368
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,460
Oh, gross.

369
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,080
I'm not...

370
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,860
I'm not doing so hot, guys.

371
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,160
More babies!

372
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,840
Yeah.

373
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,370
And dodge!

374
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:48,770
Dodge!

375
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,310
I can't see!

376
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:56,970
I can't see where the other thing is because it's like the lock-on is so... icky.

377
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,210
Dodge, dodge, dodge!

378
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:01,570
Please!

379
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,110
I was too...

380
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:11,130
She's like so slow sometimes with her movements that like I try to attack and then dodge and I'm bad.

381
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:12,690
Okay.

382
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,510
Alright, back onto you.

383
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:15,630
Why?

384
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,150
Oh, my god.

385
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:19,670
Yes.

386
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:20,910
Uh, shoot.

387
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,110
Misanity.

388
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:30,710
Okay.

389
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,710
Yeah.

390
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:45,920
Try!

391
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,390
Yeah!

392
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,930
A monster covered in swollen, skin-crawling mounds.

393
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,590
Each one pulses.

394
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,430
It spawns more and more horrors.

395
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,190
What a vile show of life.

396
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,770
I'd rather die than turn into a monster.

397
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,790
monster like this.

398
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,190
Yippee!

399
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,410
What else is in here?

400
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,310
Were there any items at all?

401
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,090
This one sucks on hard mode, I can imagine.

402
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,430
I can imagine a lot of these really sucking on hard mode.

403
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,050
There's nothing in here!

404
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,290
Stingy.

405
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,670
Stingy game.

406
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,270
Oh, wait.

407
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,250
Capsules.

408
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,790
Really?

409
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,850
Nothing else?

410
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,470
Okay.

411
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:51,890
Nothing?

412
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,730
Just capsules?

413
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,730
I guess they give you bandages before the fight.

414
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,410
I'm just looking at the room now.

415
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,190
It's kind of cool.

416
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,010
Okie dokie.

417
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,370
This is...

418
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:02,630
Yeah.

419
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,410
Uh, wait.

420
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,970
My health is...

421
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,530
Where are we?

422
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,650
Oh, we're...

423
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,350
Oh, neat.

424
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,030
Oh.

425
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,360
Oh.

426
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,620
Are those going to spawn into...

427
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,380
Those are going to probably spawn into, like...

428
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,000
What's it called?

429
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,080
Right?

430
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,060
Into nasties?

431
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,240
Jinako is clearly on the death, death, death camp instead of the birth, birth, birth one.

432
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,760
Oh, I do have full... Wait, which... Hold on.

433
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,520
What does... What does this do?

434
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,980
Arare does... Health!

435
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,840
We'll eat.

436
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,140
We'll eat that.

437
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,320
Oh, like barely anything.

438
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:05,780
That's okay.

439
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,040
I know it's gonna explode.

440
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,520
Oh, it sounds so gross.

441
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,860
Yeah, see?

442
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm already on the ready.

443
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,170
Oh, oops!

444
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,690
Oh, I killed it!

445
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:27,730
Let's go.

446
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,950
Let's...

447
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,390
I'll go around.

448
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,970
Wait, actually, maybe I should kill the other one just in case it spawns into something else too.

449
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,330
Kill, kill, kill.

450
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,470
Kill, death, death, death.

451
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,190
And also, I want to check this area.

452
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,570
I noticed that it was...

453
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,400
Eww!

454
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,820
Okay.

455
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,200
I noticed that it was blocked off, so I was like, I don't think I can come over here.

456
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,580
Oh, wait.

457
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,440
Wait.

458
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,840
Oh!

459
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,740
Oh, wait, I have to come over here.

460
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,140
Oh, okay, okay.

461
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,260
Just kidding.

462
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,680
This is the way out.

463
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,360
Anything?

464
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,360
Anything?

465
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,120
Oh, something.

466
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,320
No!

467
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,280
Brainiac Hero Comic.

468
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,520
The inside page was full of drawings.

469
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,420
Hinako were drawn in the bad guys that the protagonist defeated.

470
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,660
Wait, like an arrow pointing and saying Hinako?

471
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,160
We're pointed at the bad guys.

472
00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Moreover, in order to make the method of death even more bizarre than the manga's presentation they stubbornly added a lot of scattered blood and guts oh this is a wait i hear something though oh shoot i hate that these things can jump it's so evil oh okay yeah

473
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,410
oh my gosh they're wait they're everywhere though

474
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,620
wait where did it jump to behind me no Where did it- oh, it's over there, okay.

475
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,340
At least the blue light still works.

476
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,500
Oh my gosh.

477
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,860
This sucks.

478
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,160
Chomp, chomp, chomp, yummy, yummy, yummy.

479
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,820
Whoops, there we go.

480
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,820
Just stun looper?

481
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,480
Okay.

482
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,600
Easy.

483
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Wait, there's more?

484
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,360
Why is the music still happening?

485
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,840
Just kidding.

486
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,820
Okay, now we go...

487
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,080
this way.

488
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,790
Where does this lead?

489
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,170
Ah!

490
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,370
Okay.

491
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,390
No one's gonna jump at me though, right?

492
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,250
Please.

493
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,630
I heard a fun fact today.

494
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,010
The fact is, Minto...

495
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,310
Quito!

496
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,470
Oishiko na'are, moe, moikyo.

497
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,650
Okie dokie.

498
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,650
Place the thing here?

499
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,060
Was there...

500
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,860
Oh, there it is.

501
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,220
Brainiac hero comic.

502
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,360
Oh, that area wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

503
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, dang!

504
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,700
Sure.

505
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,980
Wow.

506
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:38,270
I wanted to say you're cute today too.

507
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,390
I wanted to say you're cute today too.

508
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,310
Yobu, kawaii.

509
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:50,150
Aibo's not going to take care of you.

510
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,330
Hinako's so cold.

511
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,210
She's just like, okay, whatever.

512
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,300
What does that do?

513
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,620
Oh, oh, oh my god!

514
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,680
It doesn't look that tight.

515
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,780
I'm sorry.

516
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,660
Cold as ice.

517
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,120
The ice queen.

518
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,360
Oh, oh.

519
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,280
This guy is the baddie.

520
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,140
He's got to be.

521
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,820
Look,

522
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,280
I'll turn it up some.

523
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,550
Yeah,

524
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,710
why are we doing this?

525
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,590
The worst she could say is no.

526
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,340
She left him hanging like me.

527
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,980
mended to duck why are we still not over duck

528
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:41,710

00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,550
a woman who was trying to steal my body from the old man.

533
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,810
It's like an alien trying to take over me.

534
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,330
If this were space wars, my partner should be coming to the rescue.

535
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,110
But there's no sign of him.

536
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:17,150
Okay.

537
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,530
Onwards.

538
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:21,830
Into the mountains?

539
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,370
Did they go without me?

540
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,710
So rude.

541
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,370
Thank you so much for the super chat.

542
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:33,950
Thank you.

543
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:39,990
Good.

544
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:56,870
Give me out of here, please.

545
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,280
Imagine if they...

546
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,260
What?

547
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,180
If they made you decide, they're like, left or right.

548
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,020
Don't get it wrong.

549
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,770
What?

550
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,430
What?

551
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,890
Do we have the abominable snowman up in here?

552
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,790
Oh wait, was that the smoke monster from the beginning?

553
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,970
Maybe.

554
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,110
Find a way to Shu's house.

555
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:36,850
Okay.

556
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,870
That's...

557
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,750
Wait, that's the school.

558
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,970
Uh, Shu's house is...

559
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,930
Over yonder?

560
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,850
Oh, all the way over there.

561
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:47,370
Okay.

562
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,530
I hope not.

563
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,610
She's so cute.

564
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,330
I would like to save.

565
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,530
It's a big map.

566
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,170
It is.

567
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,250
It is really big.

568
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,450
Bog Monster losing his patience.

569
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:15,770
Why?

570
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,030
Why?

571
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,610
He loses patience with me.

572
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,420
What's this?

573
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,340
Candies?

574
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:25,780
Chocolate?

575
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,920
That's where I came from, sorry.

576
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,760
La la la.

577
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,300
They're with the woods.

578
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,660
Is this the way...

579
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,240
Is this...

580
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,960
Is this like how far Shu had to walk every day from his home?

581
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,160
Because if so, that's the way torture.

582
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,000
Imagine having to walk back home.

583
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,180
All of these stairs?

584
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,420
Everything?

585
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,180
What's this?

586
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,500
Romani.

587
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,930
I thought I heard something in my room.

588
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:14,570
Um, I don't want...

589
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,830
We want some mushrooms, too?

590
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:16,690
No?

591
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,630
Save point.

592
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,070
What is that?

593
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,250
I'm just trying to get to the save point, please!

594
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:59,750
Uphill both ways For real Guy is the most fit person in town Let's see I have enough for health But I think maybe we'll save for more stamina Huh?

595
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:10,850
I also want a gotcha But I will resist He's pretty close to school, so it would be pretty chill.

596
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,690
Maybe, yeah.

597
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:17,890
I'll try that.

598
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,370
There we go.

599
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,570
Strange note.

600
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:20,630
I'm sorry.

601
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,850
Something urgent came up.

602
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,030
So I can't come with you.

603
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,770
Just trust me and continue down the path we decided.

604
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,850
I'll get everything ready and wait for you.

605
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,730
So there's...

606
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:41,230
Oh.

607
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,910
If I go straight...

608
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,390
Okay.

609
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:48,430
So over there is like a little shrine or something.

610
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:51,950
What am I hearing?

611
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,610
I'm gonna go over here.

612
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,530
And ignore that.

613
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:00,750
Oh!

614
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,970
Okay, let's go offer some stuff up.

615
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,230

616
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:13,010
How much is chocolate?

617
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:14,610
Let's offer chocolate.

618
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,830
And Ramanay?

619
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,110
Yeah.

620
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,120
Yeah.

621
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,900
Buddy costume, what did I miss?

622
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,600
Actually, we haven't even been...

623
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,860
It's almost been an hour already.

624
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,400
Honestly, not that much has happened.

625
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,380
Wait, will this give me enough?

626
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,600
No.

627
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,320
Sad.

628
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,220
What do I need?

629
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,280
A thousand one hundred.

630
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:54,970
Okay.

631
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,250
1,100 for stamina.

632
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:58,990
Okay, alright.

633
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:01,990
So I have to go- wait.

634
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,770
Let's go get this.

635
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:07,870
Thank you.

636
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,950
And I will save one more time.

637
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,590
Just because I did all that stuff.

638
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,270
Okay, cool.

639
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,530
Showed my friend my- Wait.

640
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:19,710
The performance- wait.

641
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,390
Performance of Snake Kid from the show.

642
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,910
Now he's asking me where he can buy mid-bird?

643
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,410
What?!

644
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,010
Thank you!

645
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,140
Thank you so much for sharing.

646
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,740
Oh, he's up there!

647
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,610
I just... wait, what is to the left though?

648
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,230
What's over here?

649
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,690
A little exploration?

650
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,430
Oh, I don't... I don't trust that.

651
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,830
I don't trust that at all.

652
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:10,530
Uh...

653
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:14,650
Uh...

654
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,850
Is it gonna wake up?

655
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,070
I just wanna go off for this.

656
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:20,590
Please don't wake up.

657
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,110
Ah!

658
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:21,690
Jesus!

659
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:22,850
Sorry!

660
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,270
Ah, you!

661
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:25,050
Dang it!

662
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,730
Ah, that's so mean!

663
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:29,110
Safe.

664
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:30,430
Ah!

665
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:36,050
My durability.

666
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:37,170
Oh.

667
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:37,990
Oh.

668
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,870
Ah!

669
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,730
And there's nothing in here.

670
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,170
You're so rude.

671
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,430
I knew it was coming.

672
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,730
I knew it was.

673
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,290
Oh, I

674
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,100
see him.

675
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,520
I see him.

676
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,460
You guys see him up there?

677
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:07,730
Oh, where'd he go?

678
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,770
Wait, am I crazy or did he just blip out of existence?

679
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,030
Wait.

680
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:15,210
Oh?

681
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:18,450
Wait...

682
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,390
He was just there.

683
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,610
Wait, what happened to him?

684
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,450
I'm not losing it.

685
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,550
I promise.

686
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,770
I'm so angry that I took damage.

687
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:34,590
I'm so mad.

688
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:37,930
But now...

689
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,090
Just 40.

690
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,590
I could give up one Higashi, maybe.

691
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,440
More stamina!

692
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,220
More stamina.

693
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,500
Let's go!

694
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,960
You now have more stamina.

695
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,060
Yes.

696
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,320
Yes, I do.

697
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,680
Thank you, I may have missed my earlier super chat.

698
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,360
I'm sorry!

699
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,120
Request a happy birthday!

700
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,900
Oh, Noah!

701
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,320
I'm so sorry!

702
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,360
Happy birthday!

703
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,860
Hey!

704
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,460
Happy, happy birthday!

705
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,260
I'm so sorry!

706
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:20,990
I missed it.

707
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:23,720
Okay.

708
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,840
My knife is still at the good...

709
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,640
Do I have toolkit?

710
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,760
I have one.

711
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,120
Okay.

712
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,600
We'll keep the knife on us then.

713
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,020
I think he actually left.

714
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,850
Alright, I know I can run, but I'm nervous.

715
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,190
Oh, I hear him again.

716
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,410
That's the thing about this game.

717
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,950
Because I know I can run.

718
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,010
But I'm nervous about it.

719
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,530
Especially when I have things like this running around.

720
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,810
They run at me.

721
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,240
Okay, so he's like a scripted guy.

722
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,320
What are you eating there?

723
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,380
Surely not.

724
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,240
Some treats that were for me.

725
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,000
Is that an axe?

726
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,280
It's not the easiest weapon to yield due to how heavy it is, but it is reliable.

727
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,640
What should I get?

728
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,340
What should I get rid of?

729
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,360
What was he eating here?

730
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,180
I don't know.

731
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,860
I feel like it's maybe similar to the sledgehammer.

732
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,220
Drop the pipe, really?

733
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,600
Pipe is basic.

734
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:11,990
Goodbye.

735
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,620
Oh my god.

736
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,600
It's a little slow.

737
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,160
Um...

738
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,020
Okay!

739
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,200
Cool.

740
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,160
Um...

741
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,700
Does this circle...

742
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,040
Wait, so... Sorry, I'm just getting my bearings.

743
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,280
What is up here?

744
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,300
It's slow, slow, yeah.

745
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:52,200
What is up here that I will regret going to see?

746
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,380
We're exploring a tad.

747
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,660
Just a smidge of...

748
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,870
I guess I could try out the axe on her.

749
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:12,190
Okay.

750
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,050
I think I can maybe...

751
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,630
Wait, hold on.

752
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,450
I need to check something in the tutorial real quick.

753
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,120
Combat.

754
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,100
Hold on.

755
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,360
When I do...

756
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:35,840
I can't remember when I do the charge attack if it's RB or RT.

757
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,560
Focus.

758
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,580
Okay, it's RB.

759
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,180
Okay.

760
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,940
Oh, I can't move.

761
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,840
Oh, that's right.

762
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,500
I do, if it's a heavy weapon.

763
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:52,720
Oh, shoot.

764
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,940
Pink bunny girl running at you with an axe is an aesthetic.

765
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,480
Ah.

766
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,540
I see that right there.

767
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,720
Is it worth it?

768
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,960
And, oh, there's something right there.

769
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,260
Oh.

770
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,420
You.

771
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:21,940
Who?

772
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:22,460
Who?

773
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:22,960
Where?

774
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,440
Where will you come from?

775
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,600
Where will you come from?

776
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,120
Where will you come from?

777
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,300
Strange note.

778
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,200
To whoever finds this, please immediately.

779
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,380
There's here.

780
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,080
I beg you.

781
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:37,500
Help.

782
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,830
No.

783
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:47,850
No way.

784
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:55,530
Who?

785
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:55,850
Where?

786
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,450
Leave me alone.

787
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,270
I'm tired.

788
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,420
Okay.

789
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,240
So now...

790
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,560
We just keep going.

791
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,360
I'm gonna go save.

792
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,120
One minute, guys.

793
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:27,840
I'm being a baby.

794
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,040
I'm so sorry.

795
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,320
Danik, welcome back.

796
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,020
Thank you.

797
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,480
Thank you, thank you.

798
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,140
Am I being a baby?

799
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,340
I don't care.

800
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,660
Am I being a baby?

801
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,060
Yeah.

802
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,920
I don't care.

803
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:46,920
Whatever.

804
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,460
I don't care.

805
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,620
I'm being a baby.

806
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,420
Protect the baby.

807
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:57,960
Alrighty.

808
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:00,640
Okay.

809
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,080
Now I walk.

810
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,720
Wait, is this the right way?

811
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,020
Yeah.

812
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,620
It does go around.

813
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,740
What's on the other side?

814
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,120
What's over here?

815
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,480
I think I regret being curious.

816
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,120
Nothing!

817
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:21,760
Stingy.

818
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,480
Stingy game.

819
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,280
Bibby Quarry, thank you so much for the five gift, thank you!

820
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,830
What is that?

821
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,110
That's a...

822
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:39,510
Oh.

823
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,970
Yeah.

824
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:43,390
Wait, there's two of them.

825
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:44,290
Oh, no.

826
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:46,250
Oh, jeez.

827
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,070
Oh, jeez.

828
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:48,490
Oh, jeez.

829
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,370
Oh, jeez.

830
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:49,690
Oh, jeez.

831
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:50,070
Oh, jeez.

832
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:50,070
Oh, jeez.

833
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:50,510
Oh, jeez.

834
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,330
Oh, jeez.

835
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,270
Oh geez, oh geez, she's fast, she's fast.

836
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:55,270
Oh geez, oh geez, oh geez.

837
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,390
Oh gosh, I'm too slow with this thing.

838
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:03,830
Get her!

839
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,830
Get her butt!

840
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,770
Yeah.

841
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,250
Oh, I'm really slow though.

842
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,000
Trying to decide.

843
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,940
Only three hits, yeah.

844
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,300
Hold on, I'm checking the map.

845
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,300
I'm thinking...

846
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,020
I'm...

847
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:33,840
See, there's like this little, that little like area to the left, but I think I might just want to run past this dude.

848
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,320
But I'm checking over here if there's anything.

849
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,200
Yes.

850
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,420
Good stuff.

851
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,760
Can I run past you?

852
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,300
Please, let me...

853
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,080
Wait, what's that?

854
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,680
Oh, wait, oh!

855
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:52,920
Oh!

856
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,460
Oh!

857
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,140
Okay, just kidding.

858
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,280
I'm running.

859
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,060
Oh, that was inside the house!

860
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
Wait, but I kind of want to see what's in there.

861
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,080
I accidentally discovered the way.

862
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,040
He's just going all by himself.

863
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,160
What if there's...

864
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,500
Well, okay, just kidding.

865
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:21,440
Ah, anyway.

866
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:35,470
yeah later alligator we ignore him we ignore that guy we don't care about him

867
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:46,430
okay my game just saved so I feel a little bit better

868
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:59,960
okay wow this area is like all we are like two feet away from the school I feel like we're so far from his house.

869
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,720
You're walking in the woods.

870
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,820
There's no one around and your phone is dead.

871
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,460
Out of the corner of your eye you spot her.

872
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:14,980
Okay, I hear things from literally both sides.

873
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,620
Oh, whoops, that's not what I meant to do.

874
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,060
There we go.

875
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,360
That's what I meant to do.

876
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:30,880
I think for whatever is around here, we... I can't see where it is, though.

877
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,000
I might want...

878
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,500
Uh, my knife instead.

879
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,960
Where Raminé?

880
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,540
Oh, he's up in the tree!

881
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,260
Oh my god.

882
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,580
Quit monkeying around up there.

883
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,560
roads.

884
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,180
Well, what's in the middle here?

885
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,520
Surely this is probably some kind of puzzle of the sorts.

886
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,640
Oh, nothing?

887
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,080
Okay.

888
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,440
Just, uh...

889
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,120
Just another way around.

890
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,080
Is this way blocked or something?

891
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,240
Am I crazy?

892
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:39,880
No?

893
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,280
Okay.

894
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,640
Oh, to the...

895
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,620
That little ghosty's room, son.

896
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,640
Just warning, you guys.

897
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,660
Okay, I'm just going around.

898
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,420
What's in here?

899
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:00,860
Quidzu.

900
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:02,440
Um.

901
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,120
Erm.

902
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,440
There we go.

903
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,580
That actually works out.

904
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,060
This is still in the tree.

905
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,240
Oh, I see her.

906
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,000
Oh!

907
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,240
You see him!

908
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,580
Oh, shoot.

909
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,120
Huh.

910
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,160
What's he standing there for?

911
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:48,900
Oh.

912
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,220
Are you scared of the stairs?

913
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,760
You are pretty hefty.

914
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,380
You might lose your balance.

915
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,640
You don't have really, like, a good...

916
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,660
you know.

917
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,340
What's he doing there?

918
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,360
Sorry, I'm just trying to...

919
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,860
Okay, so there is like a tiny shrine ish, maybe?

920
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,000
Hold on, let's go around.

921
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,000
Sorry.

922
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,000
I'm stalling 100%.

923
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And you can call me out on it.

924
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,320
Wait.

925
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,960
Oh, no, what's down here?

926
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,300
Oh, I almost missed this.

927
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,440
My throat is a little sore.

928
01:06:33,460 --> 01:07:06,520

What was I doing?

930
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:15,230
Oh, the other side.

931
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:18,410
I ran past the bridge.

932
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:22,750
This is times like these where I wish I had a gun.

933
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:24,790

He's just chilling there.

947
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:38,530
I think he really doesn't like the stairs.

948
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,930
And we have no idea what's beyond there.

949
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,130
I can't... I can't tell.

950
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:46,330

959
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:58,860
gang.

960
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,100
It's just squirrels.

961
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,140
Oh my gosh!

962
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,460
I took a walk!

963
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:09,160
I took a walk yesterday and I saw a possum.

964
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,840
I was like, whoa!

965
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,820
There's a possum.

966
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,040
Oh, he left.

967
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,220
Not really, but like, kind of.

968
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,180
Alright, I think I'm just gonna...

969
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,640
I have to run past him.

970
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:35,410
No, it was that night when I saw him.

971
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,890
I thought it was a squirrel going up a tree.

972
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:42,730
Wait, where am I?

973
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:43,230
Hold on.

974
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,030
Oh, I just went the wrong way.

975
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:46,610
Okay, but we're picking this up.

976
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,390
I thought it was a squirrel and I was like, that's a really big squirrel.

977
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:54,510
But it was a possum.

978
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,650
Research notes on Hakko Kusou.

979
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:15,530
I have learned from reading exotic or herbology that Kakura Makakura is made by grinding up the seeds of Hakko Kusou, an extraordinarily rare herb.

980
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:23,110
Hakko Kusou is notoriously difficult to cultivate as it requires a very specific environment in which to grow.

981
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,630
Rarely found in the wild.

982
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:29,470
This precious medicinal herb is so prized.

983
01:11:29,490 --> 01:12:13,670
it has earned itself the title of the flower of the gods according to folklore the herb can give one the ability to converse with gods visit visit their lands what does that mean we're visiting the gods lands and even awaken dormant powers with the manifold divine experience this herb is rumored to provide it it is no surprise that numerous legends talk of kings journeying to find it under the belief it holds the key to immortality when ground its seeds are said to smell of peaches i think this is a drug

984
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:26,410
okay he's just doing his own thing did i get everything over here yeah okay we're gonna run Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

985
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,470
And look at the map.

986
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:32,070
This place is huge!

987
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,450
Wait, so I can go under the bridge.

988
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:37,410
What?

989
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:39,770
Or I could go this way.

990
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,850
I'm just looking for a save point, actually.

991
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:46,670
Wait, so if I go this way...

992
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:48,810
What?

993
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,890
This place is humongous.

994
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:58,410
Anyway...

995
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,850
The bad music is back.

996
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:02,490
Uh, I think?

997
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:03,570
Actually, I can't tell.

998
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,650
I'm just walking.

999
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,010
I'm walking here!

1000
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:11,790
Uh...

1001
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:17,290
So I see the tree down here.

1002
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,850
There's a tree here.

1003
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,150
That we'd be doing a little bit of hiking.

1004
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:52,310
so this is blocked we'll just make it marked on the map there we go okay so we have to go to the north well isn't that good because shoes is all the way up there shoes house is north so it makes sense that we need to go up wait does this open oh my

1005
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:13,610

1008
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,720
Oh!

1009
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,620
There he is up in the tree.

1010
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,980
Look at the little monkey.

1011
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,400
Get out of here.

1012
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,460
Oh man!

1013
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,760
Okay, well we know what's in this area at least.

1014
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:05,980
Oh, that sucks though.

1015
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:10,870
Stinky.

1016
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,350
Stinky situation.

1017
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:18,090
That was, that was like the worst spot to be trapped in.

1018
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:20,890
Toolkit.

1019
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:28,190
Like, with, with the weapon I had.

1020
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:34,750
I forgot about how badly the game, um...

1021
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,810
Was there anything over there?

1022
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:38,250
I don't think so.

1023
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:38,870
I don't remember.

1024
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:48,450
but uh how badly the weapons like get get stuck

1025
01:15:52,950 --> 01:16:03,990
yeah we weren't so far it was mostly me exploring exploring so it could be worse what was down there i don't remember

1026
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:23,600
look on oh wait come come come and Oh my god!

1027
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,140
Again!

1028
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,000
Suck!

1029
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,120
I got her first.

1030
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,040
And we're... Oh, I got her?

1031
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,100
Nice, okay.

1032
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,800
That was so bad.

1033
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,060
Long weapons are evil.

1034
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,520
Okay, it was you.

1035
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,160
Oh, oops, wrong button, sorry.

1036
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,280
Divine water.

1037
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:48,880
Oh, that's right.

1038
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,200
I was gonna eat the yokan.

1039
01:16:53,260 --> 01:17:07,960
one i mean honestly i can have both but whatever oh yeah the game is evil a little bit sometimes oh

1040
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,970
he's not afraid of the stairs oh yes he is but

1041
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:24,850
um what you doing there bud i'm running i'm running i'm running i'm running i'm running

1042
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:28,610
Seriously?

1043
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:34,210
I don't know if I need to like read this again to have something activate.

1044
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:35,570
Okay, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1045
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:49,580
The thing that I opened up seems to be just a shortcut around.

1046
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:58,500
So do I need to go back there and open it?

1047
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,480
Like the save point is so far, there should be enough.

1048
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:34,490
one like what I'm gonna do though is I'm still going to do this and then yeah I just spawn the enemies screw you screw you we're just gonna keep on walking and hope for another save point because it's so far let's

1049
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:40,570
go this way

1050
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,260
Pantages!

1051
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:51,280
Uh, what I will do is...

1052
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:51,520
You.

1053
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:53,800
Uh, delicious.

1054
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,160
Thank you.

1055
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,400
Oh my gosh.

1056
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,760
I don't want to deal.

1057
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:07,880
So...

1058
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:08,720
True!

1059
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,040
Yeah!

1060
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:15,140
Kill her!

1061
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,020
Oh, she's dead.

1062
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,920
Go away.

1063
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:20,920
Alright.

1064
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,300
Where did she come from?

1065
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:25,980
Mysterious.

1066
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,520
That guy is still over there.

1067
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,260
That's him.

1068
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:32,620
Okay.

1069
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,900
Where is a save point?

1070
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,400
Am I missing it?

1071
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,120
Am I blind?

1072
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,380
Wait.

1073
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:39,980
Nope.

1074
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:40,720
That's a map.

1075
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:46,550
And she came from the trees.

1076
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:55,470
Oh, greatly decreases the amount of stamina consumed when sprinting in fights.

1077
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:00,930
It's close.

1078
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,230
We're good.

1079
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:12,930
Oh, I see you.

1080
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,190
I see you right there.

1081
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:15,970
I finally...

1082
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:18,030
Did we?

1083
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,010
Oh, it saved!

1084
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:22,130
Okay, well, the game saved for me, so I don't feel so bad.

1085
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:23,590
Oh, what is this?

1086
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:28,190
I locked our sanctuary to protect it, but don't you worry, because I have the key.

1087
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,510
I'll be waiting for you at the mountain refuge.

1088
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:33,370
I won't let anyone or anything hurt you anymore.

1089
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:35,670
I'll protect you until the end of time itself.

1090
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:38,990
I'll stay by your side until death do us part.

1091
01:20:43,150 --> 01:21:39,650
Are we not concerned about them right like if they were the ones who were writing these notes Are we not concerned about the tone of them at all or are we just gonna ignore that Oh we got a map what whoa okay cool We're just gonna be like part okay it's so normal it's fine because currently i don't think it's them writing it obviously but it's just kind of funny that she's just like oh they wrote this they must be at the shed okay cool like it's just just normal for her no our yokan i wish where is the save point so i can offer something Oh,

1092
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:40,790
there's two of them?

1093
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:44,210
Why?

1094
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:46,750
Why?

1095
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,830
I guess I could run past, but why?

1096
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:52,750
Why?

1097
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:55,610
Why?

1098
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:58,410
Why?

1099
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,210
Well, the game did just save.

1100
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:17,710
Oh, what's happening here?

1101
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,190
Oh.

1102
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:20,290
Oh!

1103
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:21,910
They didn't wake up!

1104
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,110
And I just ran into this guy.

1105
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:27,690
Wait, this is like...

1106
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:29,190
This also feels like a boss fight.

1107
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:32,070
This...

1108
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,070
Oh, another one?

1109
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,180
Why?

1110
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,260
And I can't lock onto them, which means they'll wake up later.

1111
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,780
When I'm running home.

1112
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,800
When I'm running away from this area.

1113
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:49,420
Oh my gosh, another one!

1114
01:22:50,240 --> 01:23:17,900
there's gonna be a bajillion of these guys around oh my gosh I like how the tree has faces the view's great isn't it I've always wanted to see it with you you're probably alright if you made it this far but just to be sure you're not being followed by anyone right this is our own private sanctuary we don't need anyone else sorry my headphones are starting to it's only my right ear that my

1115
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:45,500
earbuds bother only my right ear you're my best view yeah the new ones yeah i ended up getting uh the iems because i'll be honest i've had my old headphones like the over the ear ones for a really long time.

1116
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,680
Maybe not a really long time, but they've started to get kind of like gross.

1117
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,800
Like some days, some days I'll have makeup on and I'll put them on.

1118
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,820
And like the makeup is still kind of still on them.

1119
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,680
And I can't wash them.

1120
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:05,880
So they're kind of gross.

1121
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,200
And I was like, I don't really want to use them anymore.

1122
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,420
So

1123
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,100
So...

1124
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:16,620
Yeah.

1125
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,200
Gotta clean the padding.

1126
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:19,740
But how?

1127
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,000
I can't take them off.

1128
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:32,240
I don't dislike these IEMs right now so far.

1129
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:34,280
It's just my right ear.

1130
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,100
My left ear is totally fine.

1131
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:40,660
My right ear is like, oh my gosh, I had coffee and my hands can't stop shaking.

1132
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,400
No, you can't replace the pads on these.

1133
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:50,680
I have tried.

1134
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,440
You can't, you cannot.

1135
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,160
Unless there's a secret that I don't know about.

1136
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,820
But like, I don't want to tear them off and break them.

1137
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,400
At the moment, it feels that way.

1138
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,380
I don't remember what.

1139
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,280
I just only know that they're Razor headphones.

1140
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,240
But I don't know which ones they are.

1141
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,440
Specifically.

1142
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:11,140
Okay.

1143
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,300
No one is following us, right?

1144
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,500
Why are there so many?

1145
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,180
Wow!

1146
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:18,440
We're like right next to her.

1147
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,800
The booty crack.

1148
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:22,840
Wow.

1149
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,030
What's over here?

1150
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:29,830
More note?

1151
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,750
Oh, just capsules.

1152
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,270
There's so many.

1153
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:37,910
This feels like a boss.

1154
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:46,470
Well-defined booty.

1155
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,210
Booty crack.

1156
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:56,530
Just making sure I'm not missing anything.

1157
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:06,350
This is so freaking me.

1158
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:09,310
If they all come to live, it's over.

1159
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:16,210
If they all wake up, I will just...

1160
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:18,190
I'll just...

1161
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:20,050
Look, she's even holding a dive!

1162
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,160
I'm just asleep.

1163
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,660
Don't mind me.

1164
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,250
Don't even try.

1165
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,110
Uh-oh, my durability though.

1166
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:48,830
I got you.

1167
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:50,470
What is this?

1168
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:51,310
Oh, another Emma.

1169
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:01,170
Save point.

1170
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,750
I'm in Tokyo this weekend.

1171
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:05,570
Any suggestions?

1172
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:09,730
Suggestions for fun things to do.

1173
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:10,810
Hold on.

1174
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:13,430
Give me one second to not have so much anxiety.

1175
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:17,070
Oh, we made it.

1176
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,210
We made it.

1177
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:25,150
Oh, gosh, getting to a safe point feels so good.

1178
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,670
Okay, let's get rid of the ramen in the divine water.

1179
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:32,710
Yeah, that should be good.

1180
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,250
Oh, feels so good.

1181
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:42,210
This looks like it's going to break open, no?

1182
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:46,950
Oh, the gate key.

1183
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:50,590
Things to do in Tokyo this weekend.

1184
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:57,630
Oh, I don't know.

1185
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:00,390
I don't know what's going on this weekend.

1186
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:05,980
I don't know.

1187
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:11,040
Why is my mind drawing a blank?

1188
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,940
Yeah, always visit maid cafes.

1189
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:23,980
Halloween?

1190
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:28,360
For Halloween, you probably would want to go to like Ikebukuro, I think.

1191
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,980
planetaria wait i think i've been there before

1192
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:46,110
wait let me check i might have to get some food soon i'm starting to get so shaky

1193
01:28:49,150 --> 01:29:49,310
yeah i have been here the conica planetaria it's really nice yeah i remember i went and uh the guy i went because the narration was by um oh my god oh my gosh why my brain wants to say yonezu kenchi and it's absolutely completely wrong um uh uh k uh tuda kenjiro was the voiceover and his voice is like so so um nice so that's why i wanted to go listen because he has like the butteriest voice ever and there was a part at the end when like it got really quiet and even the music stopped and everything was over and you it's like complete silence in the room and then suddenly you hear a guy go

1194
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,520
yeah he's got like the sexiest voice ever

1195
01:30:04,860 --> 01:31:36,150
it was so quiet it was quiet like you didn't hear this guy the entire time and then as soon as the room just was like matt it was like maybe like a minute away from the program ending as soon as as soon as it was like the absolute silent in the room just anyway yeah um that would be fun you could always do that uh i don't know why my mind is drawing such a blank on like things to do in I think the there's like I don't know just just go have fun I always recommend Enoshima though I love Enoshima it's a little out of Tokyo though have I recommended team labs I've been to a couple of the team labs there's one in Ginza I don't recommend that one because i feel it's it's there's a bunch of goldfish not sorry i i lisped because i almost bit my tongue there's there's a bunch of fish but like they're in there i don't think the conditions they have them in is very nice so if you go to team labs there's one is it odaiba does is it i think it's odaiba that one's not so bad So,

1196
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:39,630
uh, Odaiba, yeah.

1197
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:42,750
Yeah, the one, the team labs in Odaiba, I recommend.

1198
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:49,650
I don't recommend the one in Ginza because of the fish.

1199
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,090
It makes me sad.

1200
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:57,270
They're like very overcrowded and in very small tanks.

1201
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:59,890
And I'm like, this just makes me so sad.

1202
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:02,610
Yeah.

1203
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:04,290
Anyway.

1204
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,710
You've come such a long way, you're doing so well.

1205
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:11,130
You don't need to worry about your silly old mundane world anymore.

1206
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:13,450
We'll break free from all of that here.

1207
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:14,970
Welcome to our sanctuary.

1208
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:18,450
The others are overjoyed to have you as a new addition.

1209
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:27,720
I didn't know that this was the gate key, so now I'm scared.

1210
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,960
Where are we?

1211
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,080
So I go inside here?

1212
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:38,320
Oh my gosh!

1213
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:39,420
Oh my gosh!

1214
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:39,640
Ah!

1215
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,120
Oh my gosh!

1216
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:41,820
Whoa!

1217
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:42,660
Whoa!

1218
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,180
I got a crowbar!

1219
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,380
Um, let's get rid of the sledgehammer.

1220
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,060
Ugh!

1221
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:01,380
Sorry.

1222
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:09,990
Ew, he's licking me!

1223
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:12,410
Oh, gross.

1224
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:13,950
Uh, I can't see anything.

1225
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,630
The camera angle is terrible.

1226
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:20,450
Oh my gosh.

1227
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:21,030
Ouchy, ouch.

1228
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:22,030
Wait, I'm trying to use...

1229
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:22,510
Oh, there it is.

1230
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:32,180
Is he dead?

1231
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,160
Oh, wow.

1232
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,480
Wait, this thing is awesome.

1233
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:37,020
Well, that was not great.

1234
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:42,000
Let's look around a little bit before I go inside.

1235
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,420
Let's just...

1236
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,160
Nothing, maybe.

1237
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,000
Hopefully nothing.

1238
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:53,580
Oh!

1239
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:55,680
Shriveled...

1240
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,380
Abura Aagi.

1241
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,040
I will go donate that.

1242
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,720
What was that?

1243
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:08,220

1244
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:17,790
Actually, because I kind of took some...

1245
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:18,930
I took some damage there.

1246
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:23,390
Wow, 500!

1247
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:25,310
Nice.

1248
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:26,070

01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:29,830

1252
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:07,190
I'm just seeing what's here.

1253
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:09,130
Oh, we're on the other side of the tree.

1254
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:10,990
Oh.

1255
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:14,390
And then...

1256
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:15,350
Is there anything here?

1257
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:17,330
I'm not gonna do that.

1258
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:19,590
Because I'm not gonna... I'm not...

1259

Fool me once.

1265
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:28,910
Shame on you.

1266
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,050
Full of me twice.

1267
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,230
Shame on you.

1268
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:36,250
Double.

1269
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:43,980
What do you mean I can't open it?

1270
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:46,040
Why?

1271
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,300
Open the gate.

1272
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,800
Oh, this gate!

1273
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:53,780
Oh!

1274
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,480
Oh.

1275
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,360
Wait, so I have to go...

1276
01:35:59,360 --> 01:35:59,960
Wait, so wait.

1277
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:02,820
Oh, I do have to go all the way back around.

1278
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,940
Oh my golly.

1279
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:10,130
Just kidding.

1280
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:10,730
Okay.

1281
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,580
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1282
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:19,800
Dang it.

1283
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:20,600
Oh, no.

1284
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,980
This takes me...

1285
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:27,340
Okay.

1286
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:28,360
I'm just...

1287
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:28,540
Okay.

1288
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,260
So if I move this and then I go to the...

1289
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:33,480
Left.

1290
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,240
And then it takes me back to the ponds.

1291
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,300
And then...

1292
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,900
Oh my gosh.

1293
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,000
This is...

1294
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,060
Far.

1295
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:44,420
No?

1296
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,600
Am I reading this correctly?

1297
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:01,970
My game just saved.

1298
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:07,590
Oh, why?

1299
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:08,990
Oh, why?

1300
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,910
Wait, oh.

1301
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,050
Okay.

1302
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:23,050
Okay, I'm just determining the path that I want to take.

1303
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:31,310
Oh wait, so I maybe should have opened that thing that the little that the guy dropped down before.

1304
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:34,350
It would have been a shortcut.

1305
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:36,330
Ah, okay.

1306
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:42,950
Ah, it would have, ah, the shed right there in the middle.

1307
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:45,510
I should have opened that up earlier.

1308
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:47,990
Okay, all right.

1309
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,070
I'm going to go to the right.

1310
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:52,350
I'm gonna go around, circle, go up.

1311
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,990
Wait, uh, wait, this way.

1312
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:18,720
Wait, sorry.

1313
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:24,520
From here, um, I need to go down across the bridge.

1314
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:27,540
Okay.

1315
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:32,790
What do I think?

1316
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:33,470
Wait, what was that?

1317
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:34,990
I think that.

1318
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,020
I think here.

1319
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,220
Wait, uh, what do I get?

1320
01:38:45,360 --> 01:39:21,770
Okay, we go to the right oh geez okay to the right across the bridge okay yeah i think oh geez ah what i was i was pressing b you guys i was like spamming b this is so messed up go ran please okay hold on and then I go to the left here.

1321
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,580
And we're just gonna lock the gate on them?

1322
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,260
Oh, that worked.

1323
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,660
Investigate the area.

1324
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:46,900
So true.

1325
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:49,320
So true, girlie.

1326
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,040
Just a QK.

1327
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,840
QK shins.

1328
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:54,380
Why?

1329
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:59,200
I didn't get too investing in the area!

1330
01:39:59,580 --> 01:39:59,820
Ah!

1331
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:00,580
Sorry.

1332
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,280
This is not good.

1333
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,100
Let's run.

1334
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:13,520
Run.

1335
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,500
It's so beautiful though.

1336
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,040
Oh, sorry.

1337
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,440
The game is really like, hey, you will speed run this part.

1338
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:25,640
Go, please!

1339
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,660
into a cutscene!

1340
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:47,920
Yippee!

1341
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,740
What shrine are we at?

1342
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:09,860
Cool!

1343
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,600
I was about to...

1344
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:17,380
I was literally opening the map when I fell into the cutscene.

1345
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:24,610
Yay, we made it!

1346
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:31,210
If I go back, what would happen?

1347
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:39,340
Let's not test it.

1348
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:40,340
Maybe.

1349
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,660
Let's go save, and then we'll test it.

1350
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:50,510
Nah, the Tori saved us.

1351
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,650
Now we'll go test it.

1352
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,580
Nothing's here!

1353
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:04,780
Wait, really?

1354
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:07,740
Nothing here?

1355
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,000
Nothing.

1356
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:26,970

1359
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:58,120
She's your friend and you've never been here before?

1360
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,260
What is that over there?

1361
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,160
It looks like a ghost wearing a sheet.

1362
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:11,910
Yeah, yeah, Shu's house can wait.

1363
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:18,150
I'm gonna steal from this shrine first.

1364
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,480
We're gonna go offer this.

1365
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:29,220
And then we're gonna get some more money.

1366
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,700
Then we're gonna do gotcha.

1367
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,900
Do you think they're gonna be surprised when I show up?

1368
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,000
Be like, hee hee!

1369
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,120
I'm here!

1370
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,320
We'll offer one hikashi.

1371
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:49,920
What's my health looking like?

1372
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:50,720
Yeah, it's okay.

1373
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:57,000
I like how the bunny ears twitch.

1374
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,560
They're so cute.

1375
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,440
Guys, I've been putting a lot of money.

1376
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:05,360
lot of thought into my next outfit, what I want.

1377
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:07,640
I think I've talked about this.

1378
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:21,320
I've kind of talked about this before, but because of like Ayami Mama's schedule and Celia's schedule, I'm not gonna be getting a lot of outfits, you know.

1379
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:28,620
So I have to, I have to really like, really want what I want next, you know what I mean?

1380
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:35,380
And I can't decide.

1381
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:42,280
I've been going back and forth between, like, three different ideas.

1382
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,100
I'm just like...

1383
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:47,440
Yeah, I have to really make them count.

1384
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:47,980
Yeah.

1385
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,000
It's tough.

1386
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:57,340
Let's see.

1387
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,240
Okay, we'll go to Shoe's house now.

1388
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,240
Even though there's more to explore at the shrine.

1389
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,760
I feel like it won't be the last time we go there, right?

1390
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:16,230
Taken in the atmosphere.

1391
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:17,490
Okay.

1392
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:23,730
So yeah, I don't know yet.

1393
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:27,470
Why do even the zombies have pretty pine too?

1394
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:29,770
What?

1395
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,080
What's this?

1396
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,020
Nothing.

1397
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,660
I might have to make some food soon.

1398
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:50,580
The coffee I got today was like making me...

1399
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:51,740
I think it was like super.

1400
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,500
I think it was like super.

1401
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:57,260
Yeah, Shoe's house, right?

1402
01:45:57,580 --> 01:45:58,420
Is this not Shoe's house?

1403
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:01,020
Wait, how is this not marked off yet, though?

1404
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:02,400
I can't go through here.

1405
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,200
Oh, there it is.

1406
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:04,360
Okay.

1407
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:11,940
Uh-oh.

1408
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,560
It's kind of red here.

1409
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:22,050
What is this music?

1410
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:25,030
So scary.

1411
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:28,610
Um, I don't want to go inside.

1412
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:30,430
We'll look around real quick.

1413
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:38,130
Oh, the music is...

1414
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:38,850
They're really creepy.

1415
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:47,710
How silent hill.

1416
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:51,250
How silent.

1417
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:58,410
Uh oh, it's out, it's off sync.

1418
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:01,870
New weapon?

1419
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,620
They got any good plants?

1420
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:15,800
Aibo!

1421
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:18,940
It's me!

1422
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:22,000
Was that convincing?

1423
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:25,180
Aibol!

1424
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,260
It's me!

1425
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:29,720
Wait!

1426
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:36,870
Oh wait!

1427
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:39,590
Is this not the Silent Hill?

1428
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:40,870
One reference?

1429
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:42,210
Right here?

1430
01:47:45,170 --> 01:47:46,030
It's me!

1431
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:47,550
Blarney from Black Mesa!

1432
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:57,060
Yeah!

1433
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,240
Oh, we found it!

1434
01:47:58,380 --> 01:47:58,960
Cool, cool.

1435
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:09,410
This looks like it will eventually lead to somewhere.

1436
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:10,310
Oh, just kidding.

1437
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:17,250
Is there really nothing around?

1438
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:18,510
Oh, okay.

1439
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:26,840
Aibo?

1440
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:31,120
Aibo, you sure got a lot of medicine in here.

1441
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,140
Oh, front doors!

1442
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:35,560
Keys to Shu's house.

1443
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,040
Oh, well, good thing we needed to come back here anyway.

1444
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:39,760
Wait, why did they give me so much medicine?

1445
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:40,440
Oh, geez.

1446
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:43,340
The key to Shu's house looks like it's been left here, stained with dust.

1447
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:46,100
dirt from shoes, long days of growing herbs.

1448
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,200
Prescription for my partner.

1449
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:55,460
Hinako began complaining of headaches in middle school.

1450
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:03,240
When I tried pinpointing their root cause, things always seemed to come back to stress arising from her poor relationship with her father.

1451
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,640
In other words, she is suffering from tension headaches.

1452
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:12,180
I first recommended that she use over-the-counter medicine, but soon she started asking for them more and more often.

1453
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:26,200
I don't like the thought of Hinako developing a reliance on such drugs, so I switched her to traditional Chinese medicine that uses kudzu root and peony, as it should put less strain on her body.

1454
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:36,340
That said, I know the real reason she comes around so often isn't just because she's looking for medicine, but for a place to err her grievances about her father.

1455
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:47,400
As my grandmother always said, you can greatly improve the flow of someone's chi by simply Simply by listening to their troubles and empathizing with them.

1456
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,760
Hinako was thrilled with the medicine I gave her and said it worked wonders.

1457
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,240
But the truth is that it wasn't the medicine alone.

1458
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:57,000
I want to hear out all her troubles and concerns.

1459
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:59,940
I mean, that's my job as her partner, right?

1460
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:02,680
Okay.

1461
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:08,370
Um.

1462
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:12,350
He doesn't, he seems nice.

1463
01:50:12,570 --> 01:50:13,530
He's trying to help.

1464
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:16,630
Honestly, like.

1465
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:19,670
Like, I haven't seen any issues with Shu so far.

1466
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:25,050
Like, it seems nice.

1467
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:31,550
Okay.

1468
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:38,300
Wait.

1469
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,300
Can I go in through here?

1470
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,300
Oh, it's stuck.

1471
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:50,900
When did it save last?

1472
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:52,580
Sorry, I'm just...

1473
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,020
I'm so paranoid.

1474
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:54,680
Oh, okay.

1475
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:55,520
The shrine.

1476
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:56,780
Yeah, yeah.

1477
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:57,900
Oh, what about here?

1478
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:11,920
Here we go.

1479
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:15,060
I don't like going inside the houses, though.

1480
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,000
But Niaofa makes it less scary.

1481
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,340
She is very cute.

1482
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:41,160
Very easy on the eyes.

1483
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,240
What a picture to have.

1484
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,680
have on here when you first walk in.

1485
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:57,900
I had a feeling.

1486
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,260
Oh my god, it's the Yeti!

1487
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,430
Oh my god!

1488
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,520
Oh dang, her arms are really getting beat up.

1489
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,860
Oh no, we're gonna lose our other sleeve at this point.

1490
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:22,540
Oh no!

1491
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,960
Back to dream world.

1492
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:32,120
Sasquatch is the... it's the elusive Japanese Sasquatch.

1493
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,600
A dangerous path.

1494
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:36,180
For whom do I tread such a treacherous path?

1495
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:42,530
Why are they holding hands?

1496
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:44,870
Excuse me?

1497
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,190
Hello?

1498
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:54,220
She didn't look so good.

1499
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:09,000
Did you guys notice that his hair is white and oh my god the doll run hurry there's no going back.

1500
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:16,070
Oh, no His hair is white and the and the foggy monster's hair is white

1501
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,120
Oh Creepy

1502
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,760
This guy is such a red flag.

1503
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:35,140
He's always he's always ditching us and meet those His hair is white!

1504
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:43,410
He's not a fox, he's a Sasquatch.

1505
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:56,780
The ear wiggles are so good.

1506
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:04,200
My doll is just trying to help us.

1507
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:11,700
Oh, he's down there.

1508
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:13,540
What did it say, reach the first chamber?

1509
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:18,970
There we go.

1510
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:32,870
Oh no, seems a bit like a red flag to me.

1511
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:36,250
What's down here?

1512
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:45,560
Okay.

1513
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:49,760
Can I attack it?

1514
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:54,140
Nope.

1515
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:57,180
We cannot.

1516
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,760
Why is he's always shutting doors on us?

1517
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:09,080
He's abandoning us.

1518
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:10,640
Like the guy.

1519
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,900
If he loves us so much.

1520
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:13,680
Why do you?

1521
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,400
Why do you push me away?

1522
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:17,760
Wait, hold on.

1523
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:19,320
I want to see the other side first real quick.

1524
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:23,160
He's shy.

1525
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:23,900
You think so?

1526
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,400
It's really dark.

1527
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,960
Okay, I'm scared of the dark.

1528
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:31,680
It's playing hard to get.

1529
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:33,940
Maybe.

1530
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:41,320
Wait, was that him?

1531
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,340
I saw something blue.

1532
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:46,140
What we got here?

1533
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,120
Bandage?

1534
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:50,300
Family Physicians Log February 10th.

1535
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:57,620
I've received reports that the patients will sometimes make strange sounds, then try to get on all fours and crawl around.

1536
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:15,140
housemates who serve the family for many years whisper amongst themselves speaking of so-called fox possession i have scolded them for spreading such unscientific superstitious superstitious rumors

1537
01:56:22,640 --> 01:57:16,430
sorry today i was ordered to keep silent about this matter by the head of the house the family has denied my request to transport them to a hospital I wonder if it is out of fear that talk of the supernatural or tarnish the family's reputation however I do not expect the patients conditions to improve with in-home treatment alone so guys I took one of my headphones out of my right the one in my right ear so hopefully there's nothing that I hear in the right oh my god this room is your fungus way i was about to say hopefully i hear nothing on the right side but uh definitely stuff on the left thank you so much for the breathe that worked thank you thank you

1538
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:46,580
okay actually i feel super paranoid so i'm going to put my headphones back in pain aside i gotta have them both in I guess you have to thank you so much for the gifted teacup thank you so much for the gifted teacup oh there she is

1539
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:55,400
I'm gonna go save

1540
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,300
let's just save on this one

1541
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:16,830
did I have anything to offer Eh, well we have none other than we're okay right now.

1542
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:18,430
So stressful.

1543
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:20,930
I know for what reason.

1544
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:23,010
Solemn letter.

1545
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:30,270
Halt the spread of corruption from the mortal world on thy hand and cleanse it to a silver and noble sheen.

1546
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:32,670
Rejoice Hinako and be welcome.

1547
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:37,310
Okay but like this...

1548
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:41,210
This seems a little...

1549
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:46,610
It won't budge.

1550
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,410
Wait, what's this?

1551
01:58:48,430 --> 01:58:49,010
More higashi.

1552
01:58:49,850 --> 01:58:50,770
I will offer you.

1553
01:58:56,850 --> 01:58:57,110
Wait.

1554
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:10,120
It's too heavy!

1555
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:16,310
Let's try going this way.

1556
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:21,610
I guess I'm going up to the...

1557
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:23,830
The up here...

1558
01:59:26,230 --> 01:59:27,690
The music is getting bad.

1559
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:29,390
Somebody is afoot.

1560
01:59:32,190 --> 01:59:32,190
Okay.

1561
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:34,970
I was just checking to make sure it doesn't...

1562
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:35,270
Oh!

1563
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:39,590
I think we found the suspect.

1564
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:40,730
Ah!

1565
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,360
I hear like...

1566
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:58,980
Baby.

1567
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,200
What's up with the walls?

1568
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:14,290
Okay, we do want to keep trying these though so we can...

1569
02:00:15,690 --> 02:00:16,110
Uh...

1570
02:00:17,190 --> 02:00:19,390
So that we can cross them out, you know.

1571
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:22,550
Wait, but also...

1572
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:23,490
Oh, they're just kidding.

1573
02:00:24,230 --> 02:00:24,230
Okay.

1574
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:28,810
Baby!

1575
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:33,350
Wait, that's the room I need to get into, maybe?

1576
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:39,990
Blue.

1577
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:45,550
We just gotta lead literally every single monster into here.

1578
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:49,010
That's my health, okay.

1579
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:00,980
One moment, sir.

1580
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:05,580
Actually I'll follow you.

1581
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:17,060
It's so formal.

1582
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:21,560
Okay.

1583
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:25,780
What was the whole point of that other area?

1584
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,580
I guess you find notes and stuff.

1585
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:29,580
From exploring.

1586
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:31,680
I guess I have to go back eventually.

1587
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:32,960
Oh, come on.

1588
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:34,520
Oh my god, there's two of them.

1589
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,200
There's...

1590
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:53,660
Yeah, you're just...

1591
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:54,560
They're just stretching.

1592
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:00,100
They're just like repositioning, you know.

1593
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,320
Alright, let's go through here.

1594
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:07,600
I will try to avoid fighting two at once.

1595
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:13,740
Oh gosh.

1596
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:21,400
Ow!

1597
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,700
Gosh, he got me first.

1598
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:40,830
Okay, well, it wasn't a permadeath, but...

1599
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:42,190
Beggars can't be choosers.

1600
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:45,290
Is there something probably on that table?

1601
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:47,310
Well, I don't care.

1602
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:48,830
I don't care!

1603
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:50,290
Alright.

1604
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:54,790
We go to the right.

1605
02:03:00,190 --> 02:03:01,690
Whoa, wait, do we?

1606
02:03:02,030 --> 02:03:02,290
Yes.

1607
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:04,510
It's so pretty though.

1608
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:11,310
This will open.

1609
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:15,750
Oh, it actually did!

1610
02:03:16,870 --> 02:03:17,650
Okay, shocking.

1611
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,920
This is so awkward.

1612
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:46,120
Okay.

1613
02:03:51,130 --> 02:03:51,530
Oh.

1614
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:53,530
Good morning, Miko.

1615
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:58,540
Wow.

1616
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:03,720
Can you speak up?

1617
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:04,460
I can't hear you.

1618
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:09,780
Wait!

1619
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,940
That's the fog monster's hand!

1620
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,280
Wait, I want to see the Miko.

1621
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:22,760
It's my devil arm.

1622
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:30,250
Can I use the Sasquatch arm as a weapon now?

1623
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:33,270
The bunny ears scare me.

1624
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:34,090
What do you mean?

1625
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:35,050
They're so cute.

1626
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:40,790
Bang, bang, bang.

1627
02:04:42,210 --> 02:04:42,930
What's this?

1628
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,020
Prepare myself?

1629
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:51,720
What's going on?

1630
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:55,940
Are we about to do another boss fight?

1631
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:06,760
She's gonna yank my arm off.

1632
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:08,440
Wait a second.

1633
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:10,860
Oh my god, wait a second.

1634
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:12,040
Wait a second!

1635
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:15,000
Wait, I think I was totally kidding.

1636
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:16,160
But now I...

1637
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,020
Wait, was that like...

1638
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:19,280
Wait, oh my gosh, wait.

1639
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:21,420
They're gonna chop off my arm!

1640
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,500
Oh my god.

1641
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:49,720
She is like super chill about this.

1642
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:05,400
And they expect her to do it herself?

1643
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,020
The amount of force you would need?

1644
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:17,660
New arm just dropped.

1645
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:41,140
I'm blocking.

1646
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:44,360
I'm literally conveniently censoring part of it.

1647
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:09,680
Yes, her arm.

1648
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:10,240
Thank you.

1649
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,260
Alright, now attach the other arm.

1650
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,060
Wait, we're becoming a Yeti!

1651
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,840
He's like, I like my girls a little furry.

1652
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:35,140
Yep, just pop that on there.

1653
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:37,660
Like, this is so stupid.

1654
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:46,890
Wait, I want to see it in all its glory.

1655
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:48,210
Oh, my God.

1656
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:58,380
They just popped it on there like it was like a figure or something.

1657
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,780
know, like a nendroid.

1658
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:04,120
The nendroid of Hinako is gonna go so crazy.

1659
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,440
Fits like a glove.

1660
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:09,480
Yeah.

1661
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:14,460
Yeah, she's got that yaoi hand.

1662
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:14,840
Oh.

1663
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:22,300
If you get the yaoi arm in the dreams, you get the yaoi arm in real life.

1664
02:08:27,190 --> 02:08:28,790
I mean, not yaoi, sorry, the Yeti.

1665
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:35,510
Yeah, the bunny arms do complete the look, doesn't it?

1666
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:37,290
Oh, the painkillers, thank you.

1667
02:08:51,330 --> 02:08:56,710
I wish to become foyeri.

1668
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:09,880
I want to know what the doll says about this.

1669
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:12,920
Oh my god, it looks...

1670
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,640
Wait, this is so crazy.

1671
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,400
Do I actually get to fight with this arm now?

1672
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:20,840
Oh.

1673
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:23,620
We're back in the game?

1674
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:29,440
Equipment!

1675
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:31,380
Fox arm!

1676
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:35,580
My right arm now replaced with the arm of a fox.

1677
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:38,540
The ferocity of a wild beast rests within.

1678
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:39,960
Hold end.

1679
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:43,800
near enemies who have been rendered inanimate to use soul siphon.

1680
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:46,360
This will prevent enemies from reanimating.

1681
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:50,540
Decimate enemies with razor sharp claws.

1682
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:55,520
Enemies defeated by a focus attack with the fox arm will not reanimate.

1683
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:58,400
Huge.

1684
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:01,360
No!

1685
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:03,080
No, no, no.

1686
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:07,720
Let's get rid of something.

1687
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:12,560
I think I have to get rid of a band Wait, oh no, I have like nothing to get rid of.

1688
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,380
I think I have to get rid of a bandage.

1689
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:20,820
Me at age 12 after discovering new grounds.

1690
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:22,200
What does that mean?

1691
02:10:27,020 --> 02:10:29,320
I think we'll get rid of a bandage.

1692
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:33,940
Oh, it's just the one.

1693
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:42,420
May I please offer this now?

1694
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:43,980
Wait, so...

1695
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:44,920
Oh my god!

1696
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:46,080
Ah!

1697
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:50,080
Wait, can I even...

1698
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:50,820
I can't even...

1699
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:51,620
I lost...

1700
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:56,160
I lost my other weapons.

1701
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:58,320
I can't even switch.

1702
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,960
I'm stuck with this Yeti arm.

1703
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:03,780
Don't call it a fox arm.

1704
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:05,100
I know what this is.

1705
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,220
I feel it.

1706
02:11:19,060 --> 02:11:19,900
I'm starting to...

1707
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:20,580
I think I'm...

1708
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:24,320
I'm starting to, like, really role play this.

1709
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:28,420
Give me teeth.

1710
02:11:30,940 --> 02:11:32,520
What the hell, hound arm?

1711
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:33,360
Not a fox.

1712
02:11:34,060 --> 02:11:34,680
Oh, it just saved.

1713
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:41,240
Time to try out my new...

1714
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:45,580
Oh.

1715
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:50,160
Enemies that have been rendered inanimate will reanimate after a period of time.

1716
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:53,780
While using the fox arm, hold A near A.

1717
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:56,640
enemies who have been rendered inanimate to use soul siphon.

1718
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:57,820
This will prevent... Yeah, yeah.

1719
02:11:58,220 --> 02:11:59,500
Enemy is killed using the fox arm.

1720
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:00,880
Focus attack will not reanimate.

1721
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:09,090
Oh, jeez.

1722
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:12,050
I'm no longer.

1723
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:19,480
I'm not Hinako anymore.

1724
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:20,760
What's this?

1725
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,360
This looks like water, yeah.

1726
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:26,500
The way she's walking, too.

1727
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:31,180
She's really leaning into this this dog.

1728
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:32,640
She's got that...

1729
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:36,140
She's got that dog in her and out her!

1730
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:41,390
Oh, we go back through here!

1731
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:45,250
Wait, now do I, like, tear the walls apart, maybe, you think?

1732
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:47,370
Oh, I wonder.

1733
02:12:48,790 --> 02:12:50,590
The suspicious walls.

1734
02:12:52,230 --> 02:12:53,570
Ah, okay, yeah.

1735
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:54,830
Okay, okay, okay.

1736
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:57,070
Ah, there's so much stuff!

1737
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:07,460
Whoa!

1738
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:09,900
Wait, we...

1739
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:11,420
We can now open things.

1740
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:15,240
Oh, there he goes.

1741
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:20,160
Okay, we're reaching the second ritual chamber.

1742
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:25,630
That guy kind of just...

1743
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:26,430
Oh, geez!

1744
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:32,740
Oh, my God.

1745
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,280
Soul Siphon.

1746
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:48,230
I did hear...

1747
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:50,730
Wait, I want to go to the save point real quick.

1748
02:13:51,290 --> 02:13:52,970
Which was...

1749
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:57,750
Wait, sorry, this place is tripping me up.

1750
02:14:03,010 --> 02:14:03,590
This...

1751
02:14:03,590 --> 02:14:05,910
Oh, wait, I can open this.

1752
02:14:06,990 --> 02:14:09,270
Because of our very strong arm.

1753
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:12,270
Dreamworld Hineko is just her V Supermodel.

1754
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:16,310
Oh, okay.

1755
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:22,190
I just want to offer this stuff real quick so that we can pick up anything else.

1756
02:14:23,210 --> 02:14:24,030
This one.

1757
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:27,350
Should we do some gacha?

1758
02:14:28,550 --> 02:14:32,650
I don't have any emma, so honestly, I kind of want to just draw a omamari.

1759
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:35,830
It's been a while since we've done one.

1760
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:39,970
Shame we don't get health or something for the siphon.

1761
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:44,510
I was thinking that, but yeah, having them not respawn is pretty nice.

1762
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:46,710
Oh, whoops.

1763
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:48,610
Save first?

1764
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:50,030
Okay, we're going to save scum.

1765
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:53,490
Save scum, save scum.

1766
02:14:56,650 --> 02:14:57,930
It's a good one!

1767
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:00,090
It's a good one!

1768
02:15:02,290 --> 02:15:03,710
That looks just like us!

1769
02:15:04,030 --> 02:15:07,550
Greatly increases stun power when weapon durability is low.

1770
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:08,510
Oh.

1771
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:12,610
Should I try again?

1772
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:20,740
I guess that's fine, but it makes me scared when my durability is low.

1773
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:24,080
Try again.

1774
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,120
We'll reload the save.

1775
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:36,000
Gifted, thank you!

1776
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:41,840
We're not gonna have the fox arm forever though, right?

1777
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:43,840
Surely.

1778
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:47,880
It's gonna be a good one!

1779
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:56,340
It's scripted.

1780
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:01,140
Oh my god.

1781
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,840
It's scripted.

1782
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:08,680
it

1783
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:18,520
the rng is made when your game is made it's seeded and

1784
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:31,830
if i did one more we would have like no faith threatening my friends to repay me 500 yen with my fox army

1785
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:48,610
all right anybody who has the same seed as me tell me what you got Tell me what you got next If it's worth it or not What's this?

1786
02:16:50,050 --> 02:17:06,670
Solemn letter Thy lovely silver arm grows strong Thy figure no longer mortal but the divine Unto thy limb has the power of purification been bestowed Grace us now with thy newfound strength

1787
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:17,180
Is this why there's like the memes of him I heard it but I thought it was gonna be

1788
02:17:25,330 --> 02:17:28,090
Get out Oh geez

1789
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:54,960
I am gonna eat this though Just a little snack So these walls are strange Okay no Doesn't do anything Uh If I go this way Okay We can lift up this door.

1790
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,100
Maybe.

1791
02:18:00,180 --> 02:18:01,420
Am I gonna get another...

1792
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:01,860
No!

1793
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:04,900
Am I gonna get another arm?

1794
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:08,720
That will make me able to go through walls.

1795
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:13,160
Um...

1796
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:17,100
Yeah, see, the map even shows that there's something behind here.

1797
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:18,620
You could see it.

1798
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:18,980
Okay.

1799
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:21,620
No, thank you so much for the...

1800
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:22,940
Oh, no, gifted.

1801
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:23,600
Thank you.

1802
02:18:29,730 --> 02:18:34,650
I feel like having one arm, like, kind of enhances the chuny.

1803
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:36,590
The chuniness of it all, though.

1804
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:39,530
Is that just me feeling that way?

1805
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:44,780
There's someone around here.

1806
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:45,760
Where?

1807
02:18:50,650 --> 02:18:51,650
There's something.

1808
02:18:52,130 --> 02:18:53,340
There's something around here.

1809
02:18:57,290 --> 02:18:59,130
A hundred percent yes.

1810
02:18:59,470 --> 02:19:01,510
I think it's...

1811
02:19:01,510 --> 02:19:02,550
Oh!

1812
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:03,610
Hi!

1813
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:06,830
It's this guy.

1814
02:19:06,970 --> 02:19:09,850
I think it's because, like, um...

1815
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:10,690
What is it?

1816
02:19:11,810 --> 02:19:13,430
It's, like, Chunibyo!

1817
02:19:14,970 --> 02:19:25,010
Like, the characters often are, like, at their half power, because, you know, you're nerfed, because you're don't, you're not a full demon.

1818
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:26,570
You only have one arm.

1819
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:28,470
But that makes you even stronger.

1820
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:31,410
Because then, like...

1821
02:19:31,410 --> 02:19:33,470
I don't know, there's something about it.

1822
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:38,950
Why don't they obey me now?

1823
02:19:43,630 --> 02:19:45,650
Oh my gosh, we're like...

1824
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:47,010
We're stunning them.

1825
02:19:48,010 --> 02:19:48,730
Oh my gosh.

1826
02:19:49,710 --> 02:19:51,230
Oh, I was gonna say, wait.

1827
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:54,070
Wait, he's in a blue room!

1828
02:19:55,350 --> 02:19:56,730
I'll still soul siphon you.

1829
02:19:57,230 --> 02:19:59,930
Even though this is a blue room and I shouldn't have too.

1830
02:20:01,150 --> 02:20:01,430
No,

1831
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:06,630
but.

1832
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:07,870
Inu Yasha?

1833
02:20:08,190 --> 02:20:08,710
Yeah, yeah.

1834
02:20:08,830 --> 02:20:09,350
Very similar.

1835
02:20:09,550 --> 02:20:10,070
Very similar.

1836
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:13,490
Okay, here I come.

1837
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:17,410
Okay.

1838
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:24,520
Let's save.

1839
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:25,480
Awesome.

1840
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:34,560
Telling my kids in my class I'm half Yeti and my Dark Yeti powers are sealed in my right arm.

1841
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,160
Same thing!

1842
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:40,920
Kisuke, welcome to membership!

1843
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:42,300
Thank you!

1844
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,200
Thank you, thank you.

1845
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:46,700
It's the same thing.

1846
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:50,060
Cool.

1847
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:57,450
Is this a boss?

1848
02:20:58,830 --> 02:20:59,950
I hear something.

1849
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:01,010
There's no way it's not.

1850
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:05,550
Oh, oh my god.

1851
02:21:05,710 --> 02:21:06,750
It's like a boss rush.

1852
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:09,070
Killed.

1853
02:21:19,050 --> 02:21:19,530
this thing.

1854
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:26,040
Oh, my gosh.

1855
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:28,000
Dodge!

1856
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:28,800
Nice.

1857
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:30,060
Oh, I need more.

1858
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:32,120
I need to dodge.

1859
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:32,980
There we go.

1860
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:39,200
Ouch, Ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1861
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:41,040
Whoa, my arm went crazy.

1862
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:43,320
Dodge!

1863
02:21:43,660 --> 02:21:43,920
Nice.

1864
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:50,840
That's actually kind of easier to do this, because, like,

1865
02:21:54,900 --> 02:21:55,700
than before.

1866
02:21:57,380 --> 02:21:59,480
I'm getting her both at once.

1867
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:21,980
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1868
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:24,560
Ripenter!

1869
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:27,360
Oh, shoot.

1870
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:27,960
We got her.

1871
02:22:28,340 --> 02:22:29,420
Can I take her soul?

1872
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:33,720
This is my purpose.

1873
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:37,920
Eat them up, eat them up, eat them up, eat them up.

1874
02:22:43,460 --> 02:22:45,160
We're so much stronger now.

1875
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:49,720
First aid kit.

1876
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:50,240
Hold on.

1877
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:55,380
Oh, there's it.

1878
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:55,680
Okay.

1879
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:00,940
Let's save real quick.

1880
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:04,460
Neat.

1881
02:23:11,900 --> 02:23:15,220
This door won't stop me and my Yeti arm.

1882
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:25,500
This is the point where, like, you know, kind of...

1883
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,400
A lot of horror games tend to do this too.

1884
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:30,400
Sorry, I don't mean to just complain all the time about this game.

1885
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:31,340
I am having fun.

1886
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:32,540
And I do like it.

1887
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:34,420
There's just, you know...

1888
02:23:34,420 --> 02:23:37,420
I'm very picky with horror sometimes.

1889
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,380
I had... I think it's because I had like...

1890
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:41,220
Well, not that I...

1891
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:43,980
I had high hopes and it's not that it's like not meeting them.

1892
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:49,840
It's just that a lot of horror will get into like the ridiculousness where...

1893
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:54,420
It doesn't become scary anymore because it's just so like, what the hell?

1894
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:01,960
You're just like, oh, he's holding my Yeti hand.

1895
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:02,840
Kiel!

1896
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:16,570
Wait, no, no, don't bring me...

1897
02:24:16,570 --> 02:24:18,530
No, I want to stay with my Yeti!

1898
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:20,350
Oh, yes!

1899
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:22,230
Okay.

1900
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:29,750
What will I get now?

1901
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:33,190
Okay.

1902
02:24:33,210 --> 02:24:35,410
What body part are we replacing?

1903
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:37,630
Wait, am I getting a Yeti stamp?

1904
02:24:40,150 --> 02:24:42,210
A seal of authentic Yeti.

1905
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:46,390
Oh?

1906
02:24:55,550 --> 02:24:57,490
Where he wants to brand her!

1907
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:01,690
He's like, I'll just hold you then.

1908
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,630
Oh my god, no!

1909
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:04,810
Can you not go?

1910
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:18,320
You're a real Yeti now.

1911
02:25:20,140 --> 02:25:22,080
Wait, but my uniform!

1912
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:24,740
You're gonna burn my bra!

1913
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:25,680
No!

1914
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:34,720
Oh my god.

1915
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:36,480
Oh, that's icky.

1916
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:49,450
Oh, that's This poor girl.

1917
02:25:51,090 --> 02:25:53,390
Let her sleep.

1918
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:56,630
Do I ever... Oh, good.

1919
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:59,410
Wow, we still haven't returned to the real world.

1920
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:01,290
That's it?

1921
02:26:04,650 --> 02:26:05,330
That's it?

1922
02:26:05,370 --> 02:26:07,110
My Yeti well done, please.

1923
02:26:09,350 --> 02:26:11,150
I prefer a medium rare Yeti.

1924
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:15,810
Oh.

1925
02:26:19,860 --> 02:26:20,540
Okay.

1926
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:28,230
Oh my gosh!

1927
02:26:33,930 --> 02:26:35,670
She does not look good.

1928
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:38,050
She does not look good.

1929
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:38,550
Shinako!

1930
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:40,610
Okay, there she's fine.

1931
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:43,590
She looked like she was about to pass out.

1932
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:45,170
I don't blame...

1933
02:26:45,170 --> 02:26:47,070
Oh, wow, this is so bad.

1934
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,800
I think I gotta get rid of a first aid kit.

1935
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:07,340
No, you're not smelling her burnt flesh.

1936
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:08,800
You're smelling the incense.

1937
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:15,100
Oops.

1938
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:21,230
So what power did this grant me now?

1939
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:24,680
Foxman?

1940
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:27,720
What's my new found power?

1941
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:35,700
Reach the final ritual chamber.

1942
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:40,600
Which is which way?

1943
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:46,640
The power of infection.

1944
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:51,180
Nobody's gonna treat my wounds!

1945
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:54,580
No, this is actually the real trial.

1946
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:57,280
They're just like, now you gotta lick your wounds like a Yeti.

1947
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:02,660
Okay.

1948
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:05,520
Oh, there's a lot going on in here, isn't there?

1949
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:07,580
Oh, golly!

1950
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:10,000
There is a whole party!

1951
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:12,980
Hello?

1952
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:14,320
Oh.

1953
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:17,340
The beastial form!

1954
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:24,160
The kudzu seal will fill up as you use soul siphon or attack enemies.

1955
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:26,780
Once it's full, you can use LS.

1956
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:27,160
Okay.

1957
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:32,060
I have to press down both to awaken my beastial form.

1958
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:35,300
It's my devil trigger.

1959
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:40,100
Enemies that have been defeated using your beastial form will not reanimate.

1960
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:44,260
While attacking using RBE, you can unleash a devastating attack with RT.

1961
02:28:45,020 --> 02:28:45,440
Wait, help?

1962
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:49,360
Holding down the attack for longer will allow you to deal.

1963
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:50,380
even more damage.

1964
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:54,000
While in your awakened form, you can perform a counter using RT.

1965
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:56,580
So long as the counter is possible.

1966
02:28:56,960 --> 02:29:05,880
Even if you are already in the middle of an attack, use LSRS while in your bestial form to revert the fox arm to its normal state.

1967
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:08,180
The kudzu seal will deplete while you are awakened.

1968
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:12,860
However, if you revert the fox arm before the seal runs out, then the seal will remain partially filled.

1969
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:15,200
Okay, wait, I don't understand this.

1970
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:27,120
So, attacking, if I'm attacking with RB, then I suddenly, if I just, if I'm like, bam, bam, bam, and then I press RT, I get, okay.

1971
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:29,880
I'll try it.

1972
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:35,940
Oh, here we go!

1973
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:38,560
Oh my

1974
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:02,110
god.

1975
02:30:02,670 --> 02:30:04,290
Did I suck everything up?

1976
02:30:04,930 --> 02:30:05,850
I guess so.

1977
02:30:07,370 --> 02:30:07,890
Wow.

1978
02:30:11,190 --> 02:30:12,710
You don't even have an HP.

1979
02:30:13,390 --> 02:30:15,890
The game has become insane.

1980
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,980
Pull my Yeti trigger.

1981
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:34,280
Okay, wait.

1982
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:35,380
Oh, good.

1983
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:36,580
The game just auto-saved.

1984
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:39,080
Okay, I was gonna go save.

1985
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:40,320
But what's up here?

1986
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,860
I don't think I've gone up here, have I?

1987
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:44,620
Bam, bam, bam.

1988
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:48,040
No, wait.

1989
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:50,500
No, we have not.

1990
02:30:50,620 --> 02:30:50,820
Okay.

1991
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:52,580
Oh!

1992
02:30:59,580 --> 02:31:00,040
Okay.

1993
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:01,600
We got two.

1994
02:31:10,250 --> 02:31:10,930
I'm trapped.

1995
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:15,290
Oh, I can't walk over this.

1996
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:16,410
Wait, I can't walk.

1997
02:31:16,630 --> 02:31:17,170
Okay, just kidding.

1998
02:31:19,230 --> 02:31:20,750
I was fully prepared.

1999
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:38,170
Let's refill our...

2000
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:40,390
Our Yeti bar.

2001
02:31:41,930 --> 02:31:43,550
Give me that soul siphon.

2002
02:31:44,730 --> 02:31:45,970
Oh yeah!

2003
02:31:47,230 --> 02:31:48,910
The illusion of floor.

2004
02:31:51,290 --> 02:31:53,850
I like the way she creeps around.

2005
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:55,570
The Yeti creep.

2006
02:31:57,930 --> 02:31:59,030
Oh, shoot.

2007
02:31:59,510 --> 02:32:00,850
Well, that's okay.

2008
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:02,150
We don't really need it right now.

2009
02:32:03,070 --> 02:32:03,890
Maybe later.

2010
02:32:06,790 --> 02:32:09,090
Yeti, Yeti, Yeti.

2011
02:32:14,090 --> 02:32:15,350
Here I come!

2012
02:32:15,590 --> 02:32:16,450
Yeti you're not!

2013
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:20,250
Oh,

2014
02:32:33,490 --> 02:32:33,790
shoot.

2015
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:35,810
I'm going to get rid of the Higashi.

2016
02:32:36,910 --> 02:32:39,970
I have so much stamina because I keep...

2017
02:32:40,670 --> 02:32:42,070
Yeah, I think I'll get rid of it.

2018
02:32:42,410 --> 02:32:43,730
Ah, it felt bad.

2019
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:44,650
It felt bad.

2020
02:32:44,890 --> 02:32:45,050
Oops.

2021
02:32:45,490 --> 02:32:46,430
That's not what I wanted to do.

2022
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:04,000
No way I just threw away.

2023
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:10,940
my stamina stuff and then more stamina

2024
02:33:18,100 --> 02:33:19,340
feels bad

2025
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:26,980
yeah there's no way yeah there's no way

2026
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:43,280
like and the thing is is like I wouldn't my first thought wouldn't have been like oh that's definitely something that would expand my inventory I wouldn't have.

2027
02:33:44,860 --> 02:33:47,500
I wouldn't have been like, let me go see what the other thing is.

2028
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:51,800
I guess maybe they're expected to be like, let me see what the other thing is first.

2029
02:33:53,320 --> 02:33:53,960
Oh, gosh.

2030
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:55,940
You guys, I can't do these IEMs anymore.

2031
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:56,280
Hold on.

2032
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:57,660
I'm switching my headphones back.

2033
02:34:00,140 --> 02:34:01,420
I can't do it.

2034
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:02,120
It hurts.

2035
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,620
My headphones are so gross.

2036
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:07,820
Ew.

2037
02:34:11,830 --> 02:34:12,710
Ah, ah, wait.

2038
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:15,910
Uh, okay, there we go.

2039
02:34:16,890 --> 02:34:22,570
I have to, like, change the monitor on a ton.

2040
02:34:22,770 --> 02:34:22,890
Okay.

2041
02:34:23,510 --> 02:34:25,670
Stop pulling my Yeti arm.

2042
02:34:35,150 --> 02:34:36,140
I think

2043
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:49,940
they probably want me to...

2044
02:34:49,940 --> 02:34:51,800
Yeah, they probably...

2045
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:54,740
But I want my thing fuller before I...

2046
02:34:54,740 --> 02:34:56,680
Before I, you know...

2047
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:00,660
I'm crawling around like a Yeti.

2048
02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:00,820
Maybe.

2049
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:02,080
What's this?

2050
02:35:02,700 --> 02:35:03,120
Yo kan!

2051
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:06,680
Um, well, what we're gonna do is...

2052
02:35:10,210 --> 02:35:11,050
I'll take that.

2053
02:35:11,190 --> 02:35:11,330
Okay.

2054
02:35:12,490 --> 02:35:14,890
Oh, it must be full for me to use it!

2055
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:17,330
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2056
02:35:19,070 --> 02:35:20,070
That makes sense.

2057
02:35:22,210 --> 02:35:25,870
Okay, that's where we came from, but there is a save, so I'm gonna go save real quick.

2058
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,380
Let's go find the third ritual.

2059
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:35,220
Oh, and I can...

2060
02:35:35,240 --> 02:35:41,400
We can also enthrine some stuff, like the carcass and the comb.

2061
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:42,140
Okay, perfect.

2062
02:35:43,820 --> 02:35:44,320
Yeah!

2063
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:48,700
If only I could get an Emma.

2064
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:50,560
I could do more health.

2065
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:54,500
Is she cannibal?

2066
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:55,360
No.

2067
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:00,500
She's not cannibal.

2068
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:03,720
Now we go to...

2069
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:04,160
Maybe here?

2070
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:05,920
says it's open.

2071
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:07,100
Oh!

2072
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:09,980
When did these doors appear?

2073
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:13,240
Hmm?

2074
02:36:14,540 --> 02:36:15,420
What is this?

2075
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:18,520
Letter from a woman?

2076
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:22,460
You are... wait, I messed up.

2077
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:22,760
Sorry.

2078
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:27,300
You really are shrouded in mystery.

2079
02:36:27,900 --> 02:36:31,880
You understand exactly how I feel, even though we haven't seen each other in years.

2080
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:51,020
Are you simply reading me like a book, or am I feeling exactly what it is you want me to recently i'm starting to think that even i don't know who i am anymore lady you could be my wife um

2081
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:09,990
well all the doors now are open so that's kind of cool i just don't know i guess we're just explore

2082
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:18,740
in two days.

2083
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:21,200
Satana, happy early birthday!

2084
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:25,060
I hear something.

2085
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:28,540
There was this guy in here.

2086
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:34,440
Or...

2087
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:35,320
Uh, somewhere.

2088
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,280
Behind here?

2089
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:44,840
Ugh, there's so many sounds everywhere.

2090
02:37:46,980 --> 02:37:47,460
Yeah,

2091
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:55,520
take her down.

2092
02:38:00,290 --> 02:38:01,410
I'll take that.

2093
02:38:02,470 --> 02:38:02,590
Yummy.

2094
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:19,940
Sorry, I didn't mean to yell so loud.

2095
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:21,000
Holy cow.

2096
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:26,140
Oh, yeah.

2097
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:26,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2098
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:29,840
Ouch, ouch.

2099
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:32,140
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2100
02:38:40,330 --> 02:38:40,770
Please!

2101
02:38:44,830 --> 02:38:46,130
Let's get them both at once!

2102
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:51,840
Okay, there we go.

2103
02:38:54,660 --> 02:38:55,100
Sheesh!

2104
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:57,700
It's almost full.

2105
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:00,640
Sorry.

2106
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:01,400
Oh my gosh.

2107
02:39:02,380 --> 02:39:03,800
I did not mean to yell so loud.

2108
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2109
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:08,560
Okay.

2110
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:14,900
It's definitely something here, but we don't know what's yet.

2111
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:18,020
It wasn't that loud, it wasn't.

2112
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:20,120
Compression doing its job.

2113
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:27,380
Oh, I think maybe behind...

2114
02:39:27,380 --> 02:39:27,680
Oh, wait.

2115
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:28,640
Oh, no, there they are.

2116
02:39:29,780 --> 02:39:30,100
Hello.

2117
02:39:33,230 --> 02:39:35,430
I want to open this just to open it.

2118
02:39:36,430 --> 02:39:38,190
Open it because I can.

2119
02:39:38,850 --> 02:39:39,090
Okay.

2120
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:41,030
Where were you?

2121
02:39:41,090 --> 02:39:42,370
Oh, you were behind this door.

2122
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:00,140
My sanity!

2123
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,160
Holy cow!

2124
02:40:17,420 --> 02:40:18,480
Another one?

2125
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:21,340
Or is it was just dying?

2126
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:27,080
Let's see...

2127
02:40:27,860 --> 02:40:33,240
There's this door over here that seems like it wants me to open, but I know I've been down there before.

2128
02:40:38,600 --> 02:40:39,160
this.

2129
02:40:51,580 --> 02:40:53,400
That was, that's good.

2130
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:55,380
Oh, this one right here.

2131
02:40:58,420 --> 02:41:00,340
Again, it got me.

2132
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:01,120
It got me.

2133
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:02,240
It scared me.

2134
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:06,700
Oh, my

2135
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:15,560
thing is full though.

2136
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:35,420
Let's eat Okay I hate when they fall from the ceiling Oh, open Does not use her Yeti arm I've taken notice Which way do I go?

2137
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:39,180
Is it maybe This one?

2138
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:59,070
Because it's showing this is like fully Explored, so maybe I do go here Oh, I think four oh yes i went downstairs oh so we do go to the top left this way wait what's here

2139
02:42:02,690 --> 02:42:12,680
using my yedi arm oh what's there oh i'm hungry i want inari sushi

2140
02:42:15,860 --> 02:42:46,400
Kroki Slightly restores health after defeating an enemy Not bad Not bad, not bad Housemaid's note Me However the child she carried was unmistakably A descendant of the Tzunekis And their blood lies in wait for tragedy to strike It is only a matter of time before that child exacts their revenge I believe that the next time there is turmoil within the Tzineki family,

2141
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:48,460
that child will make their move.

2142
02:42:48,940 --> 02:42:50,180
It was just a...

2143
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:53,440
That baby looks like he's out for revenge.

2144
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:57,620
It's the baby.

2145
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:02,920
Okay, I think I go through here.

2146
02:43:05,140 --> 02:43:06,260
Oh, there's a lot here.

2147
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:07,400
Ow!

2148
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:18,800
Let's go sacrifice.

2149
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:22,180
Sorry, I get so lost in here.

2150
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:24,120
Okay, we need to go down this way.

2151
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:32,040
Give Inari-zushi.

2152
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:41,120
And then I'll go grab the comb, give the comb, then grab the yokan.

2153
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:46,940
Order of operations here.

2154
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:49,980
Grab the comb, leave the comb.

2155
02:43:56,460 --> 02:43:57,460
Enshrined the comb.

2156
02:44:01,220 --> 02:44:02,360
We'll grab the yokai.

2157
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:10,300
I could give the higashi.

2158
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:12,600
But right now, I kind of want to keep it.

2159
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:19,440
Okay.

2160
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:20,680
We go through here?

2161
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:23,360
Did I not go in here before?

2162
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:27,020
I mean, I'm not sure, honestly.

2163
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:29,480
Honestly, I'm not sure.

2164
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,780
It feels like I did, but...

2165
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:34,100
not.

2166
02:44:49,690 --> 02:44:50,410
Foxman?

2167
02:44:53,210 --> 02:44:53,930
Foxman?

2168
02:44:55,150 --> 02:44:55,730
Okay.

2169
02:44:56,510 --> 02:44:57,170
Still going.

2170
02:44:59,230 --> 02:45:01,610
Oh yeah, because I remember that divine water.

2171
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:04,110
I definitely was here 100%.

2172
02:45:13,790 --> 02:45:14,510
Oh.

2173
02:45:16,750 --> 02:45:18,390
Yeah, I was here.

2174
02:45:19,390 --> 02:45:19,750
Oh,

2175
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:25,670
wait, now Now it's showing that I...

2176
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:27,470
Wait, no, I'm down...

2177
02:45:27,470 --> 02:45:28,510
Wait, oh, I'm upstairs.

2178
02:45:30,430 --> 02:45:30,910
Oh!

2179
02:45:38,650 --> 02:45:39,130
Oh...

2180
02:46:06,170 --> 02:46:06,650
Um...

2181
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:11,040
Oh, wait!

2182
02:46:12,020 --> 02:46:14,620
There's that staircase right in the middle.

2183
02:46:14,820 --> 02:46:15,480
It goes...

2184
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:17,900
it seemingly goes down, so let's try that one.

2185
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:21,700
Maybe I don't know if I have done that one yet or not.

2186
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:29,720
So if I go straight...

2187
02:46:29,720 --> 02:46:31,340
Easy to get lost in this part.

2188
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:34,240
Yeah, a little bit.

2189
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:38,000
Wait, have I gone through...

2190
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:44,380
I hear somebody.

2191
02:46:47,240 --> 02:46:48,480
Thought there might be a note.

2192
02:46:50,100 --> 02:46:50,440
Okay.

2193
02:46:53,020 --> 02:46:53,600
Uh...

2194
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:56,940
So if I go in here...

2195
02:46:56,940 --> 02:46:57,740
Oh!

2196
02:47:04,310 --> 02:47:06,050
He's talking from over here, right?

2197
02:47:07,970 --> 02:47:08,270
Whoa!

2198
02:47:13,650 --> 02:47:14,890
Have I gone this way?

2199
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:22,580
It's still lit up, so...

2200
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:24,300
I'm guessing it's...

2201
02:47:24,300 --> 02:47:24,700
Correct.

2202
02:47:25,660 --> 02:47:26,620
I feel silly.

2203
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:28,620
I feel silly here.

2204
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:31,860
The map definitely looks like it's down.

2205
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:33,080
That's what I thought, right?

2206
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:35,380
That's why I was like, wait, it's going up.

2207
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:36,080
I'm confused.

2208
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:40,540
Confusion!

2209
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:44,060
Well, okay.

2210
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:50,120
Who do I fight in here?

2211
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:55,980
Defeat the monsters, TM.

2212
02:48:02,770 --> 02:48:03,010
Oh!

2213
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:21,860
This isn't like killing him immediately.

2214
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:36,620
Oh wow, I missed!

2215
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:38,420
Oh, he's dead, that's why!

2216
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:45,740
I missed because...

2217
02:48:46,580 --> 02:48:48,320
He was already dead.

2218
02:48:48,880 --> 02:48:49,400
That was funny.

2219
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:50,300
Wow!

2220
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:52,220
Gosh, she's so strong.

2221
02:48:54,500 --> 02:48:55,740
Holy cow.

2222
02:48:58,540 --> 02:48:59,880
Afraid of nothing.

2223
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:03,620
Did I even take a hit?

2224
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:04,980
I don't know.

2225
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:09,060
Crazy.

2226
02:49:10,060 --> 02:49:10,580
What's this?

2227
02:49:11,740 --> 02:49:12,160
Yeah.

2228
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:17,700
There we go!

2229
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:27,460
Invincible in Yeti- Oh, that's right, I can't- My health bar disappears when I'm in Yeti mode.

2230
02:49:29,240 --> 02:49:30,000
Yeti trigger.

2231
02:49:34,460 --> 02:49:35,660
Why am I safe, Akaku?

2232
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:39,860
At least the bunny ears are still intact.

2233
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:43,800
The bunny ears are pristine.

2234
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:01,420
They are in mint condition.

2235
02:50:08,490 --> 02:50:10,670
What Yeti part do I get now?

2236
02:50:12,110 --> 02:50:12,890
Yeti feet.

2237
02:50:16,210 --> 02:50:16,670
Yeti.

2238
02:50:18,090 --> 02:50:19,630
Full Yeti reflection.

2239
02:50:20,870 --> 02:50:21,590
Look at yourself.

2240
02:50:22,170 --> 02:50:24,430
Don't you look kawaii when you're Usamimi?

2241
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:32,880
What's that?

2242
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:40,060
They're gonna take my eyeballs.

2243
02:50:53,410 --> 02:50:54,330
No, not that...

2244
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:55,310
Oh, I thought they were about to take.

2245
02:50:55,330 --> 02:50:57,290
off the ears.

2246
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:10,340
I think, wasn't that knife part in the trailer?

2247
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:12,980
I think I remember that.

2248
02:51:25,580 --> 02:51:30,960
Oh my god, the blood is just...

2249
02:51:39,180 --> 02:51:39,780
No!

2250
02:51:54,530 --> 02:51:55,730
Face transplant!

2251
02:52:02,850 --> 02:52:04,670
Oh, that's really freaky, actually.

2252
02:52:05,190 --> 02:52:06,370
It's so freaky looking.

2253
02:52:08,770 --> 02:52:11,150
Oh, I can't see out of those pinholes.

2254
02:52:12,410 --> 02:52:13,110
Wait a second.

2255
02:52:13,830 --> 02:52:15,390
You gotta cut them bigger.

2256
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:25,090
This made my skin crawl.

2257
02:52:27,060 --> 02:52:27,100
Yeah.

2258
02:52:48,430 --> 02:52:51,730
Wait, there's gonna clash the fox ears and the bunny ears.

2259
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:53,890
I

2260
02:53:04,660 --> 02:53:06,820
have six ears.

2261
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:08,260
Too many ears.

2262
02:53:10,380 --> 02:53:12,660
Not enough ears.

2263
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:16,820
I'm all ears.

2264
02:53:29,260 --> 02:53:32,240
But she's crashing out.

2265
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:39,740
That's why you beat your contract through it, right?

2266
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:42,720
She looks really cute, though.

2267
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:48,940
It looks really good on her.

2268
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:56,560
Why does he get special glowing eyes?

2269
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:59,280
Her eyes look really weird, though.

2270
02:54:18,790 --> 02:54:21,470
The music with the doll is so funny.

2271
02:54:22,230 --> 02:54:24,270
She's like, oh, hell no.

2272
02:54:25,970 --> 02:54:27,450
My girl turned into a Yeti.

2273
02:54:30,810 --> 02:54:32,670
Glowing eyes are another operation.

2274
02:54:33,190 --> 02:54:33,490
Maybe.

2275
02:54:35,030 --> 02:54:37,710
Oh, wait, we're getting a third eye.

2276
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:38,990
Whoa.

2277
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:40,410
Uh-oh.

2278
02:54:40,850 --> 02:54:42,210
We're becoming evil.

2279
02:54:44,090 --> 02:54:44,530
Becoming?

2280
02:54:44,830 --> 02:54:46,250
Well, I mean...

2281
02:54:47,610 --> 02:54:47,910
Whoa.

2282
02:54:55,950 --> 02:54:59,370
Wait, the mask matches her uniform!

2283
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:01,750
Yeah, it's cute!

2284
02:55:02,870 --> 02:55:04,650
It works, it works!

2285
02:55:05,430 --> 02:55:05,890
Dang it.

2286
02:55:08,250 --> 02:55:10,910
They keep giving me so much stuff here.

2287
02:55:11,570 --> 02:55:12,470
Okay, goodbye Higashi.

2288
02:55:12,670 --> 02:55:12,810
Wait.

2289
02:55:13,570 --> 02:55:13,730
Look.

2290
02:55:14,290 --> 02:55:15,430
Can I come back, actually?

2291
02:55:15,590 --> 02:55:15,990
I'm not sure.

2292
02:55:18,210 --> 02:55:19,150
I need more Emma.

2293
02:55:23,150 --> 02:55:24,030
A kid?

2294
02:55:24,150 --> 02:55:25,490
You don't think I'll need it later?

2295
02:55:34,650 --> 02:55:36,830
Wait, is it not supposed to turn pink?

2296
02:55:37,150 --> 02:55:38,810
Like, is that if you're wearing the uniform?

2297
02:55:39,370 --> 02:55:41,190
That's actually so cute, if that's the case.

2298
02:55:43,470 --> 02:55:45,130
Get rid of first aid kit.

2299
02:55:47,230 --> 02:55:47,750
Okay.

2300
02:55:48,110 --> 02:55:49,290
Normally it's white!

2301
02:55:50,270 --> 02:55:52,330
Wait, that's so cute!

2302
02:55:52,630 --> 02:55:54,430
Wait, that's something special we got to see then.

2303
02:55:54,610 --> 02:55:55,110
That's fun.

2304
02:55:56,390 --> 02:55:57,150
Trash the yokan.

2305
02:55:57,290 --> 02:55:57,950
Oh, true!

2306
02:55:59,050 --> 02:56:00,630
Because we have all the bandages.

2307
02:56:04,870 --> 02:56:06,990
Or actually I'll trash the arare.

2308
02:56:08,330 --> 02:56:11,730
Because well, actually I don't know.

2309
02:56:11,890 --> 02:56:13,790
It works better when you use more.

2310
02:56:14,790 --> 02:56:15,510
I don't know.

2311
02:56:15,710 --> 02:56:16,250
I'll come back.

2312
02:56:16,770 --> 02:56:17,250
I'll come back.

2313
02:56:17,390 --> 02:56:17,810
I'll come back.

2314
02:56:19,730 --> 02:56:20,230
Where's my health?

2315
02:56:20,290 --> 02:56:21,410
We're at full health anyway.

2316
02:56:23,850 --> 02:56:25,010
You're only 30?

2317
02:56:25,650 --> 02:56:26,090
Okay.

2318
02:56:26,490 --> 02:56:26,750
Okay.

2319
02:56:27,230 --> 02:56:27,370
Okay.

2320
02:56:27,670 --> 02:56:27,670
Okay.

2321
02:56:27,750 --> 02:56:28,350
I'll trash the open.

2322
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:32,110
I can't come back?

2323
02:56:32,250 --> 02:56:32,370
Okay.

2324
02:56:33,610 --> 02:56:33,970
Okay.

2325
02:56:34,210 --> 02:56:34,210
Okay.

2326
02:56:37,370 --> 02:56:37,810
Oh.

2327
02:56:38,090 --> 02:56:38,310
Hello.

2328
02:56:42,180 --> 02:56:42,880
Well,

2329
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:50,600
now I want to read my Fox arm.

2330
02:56:50,940 --> 02:56:52,240
Awakened Fox arm.

2331
02:56:52,740 --> 02:56:53,700
Beastia form.

2332
02:56:56,640 --> 02:56:58,760
Oh my gosh.

2333
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:02,900
Wait, what have I not read?

2334
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:05,680
Oh.

2335
02:57:06,720 --> 02:57:08,380
Mask of the Fox clan.

2336
02:57:08,720 --> 02:57:31,300
You are now able to see secrets concealed within the dark shrine using the mask from the fox clan you hold lt to use focus and discover hidden paths and clues at certain locations oh i'm i'm skipping the tutorial what did i miss under equipment though oh just heavy weapons okay which

2337
02:57:35,350 --> 02:57:41,810

2338
02:57:50,670 --> 02:57:55,210
head a little bit of what the so now it's probably going to tell me.

2339
02:57:55,470 --> 02:57:55,970
There it is.

2340
02:57:56,830 --> 02:57:57,850
You're now able to see secrets.

2341
02:57:58,330 --> 02:57:58,330
LT.

2342
02:57:58,850 --> 02:57:58,850
Okay.

2343
02:57:59,630 --> 02:58:04,250
If you spot a suspicious looking area in the dark shrine, use focus and take a good look around.

2344
02:58:09,710 --> 02:58:10,930
Oh, I can't.

2345
02:58:12,450 --> 02:58:14,790
What do you see with your Yeti eyes?

2346
02:58:15,910 --> 02:58:16,350
No!

2347
02:58:22,940 --> 02:58:23,340
Whoa!

2348
02:58:23,780 --> 02:58:24,140
Whoa!

2349
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:28,460
Oh, so that's what that was.

2350
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:30,500
Okay, that's where we are now.

2351
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:36,320
My Yeti, I see.

2352
02:58:37,360 --> 02:58:37,840
No!

2353
02:58:40,700 --> 02:58:43,520
Oh, I like how she does the Yeti walk.

2354
02:58:45,460 --> 02:58:47,000
Really big fan.

2355
02:58:47,500 --> 02:58:48,760
Just some divine water.

2356
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:50,260
That's it.

2357
02:58:51,460 --> 02:58:51,980
No note.

2358
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:53,500
No lore.

2359
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:55,660
No lore.

2360
02:58:57,020 --> 02:58:58,220
Yeti Yeti B!

2361
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:03,280
Sometimes I hear the flames and I think it's a creature.

2362
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:05,980
So it freaks me out a little bit.

2363
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:08,200
Uh, I'll hear it.

2364
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:11,980
Not even an Emma.

2365
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:12,620
I know!

2366
02:59:14,540 --> 02:59:15,020
Sucks.

2367
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:20,400
I'm gonna do one more poll.

2368
02:59:22,580 --> 02:59:24,080
Even though it's not random.

2369
02:59:24,700 --> 02:59:25,760
I'm gonna do another poll.

2370
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:28,000
Here I go.

2371
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:30,240
It's gonna be a good one!

2372
02:59:33,060 --> 02:59:34,960
There wasn't Emma at the last ritual to be fair.

2373
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:36,560
That's true, that's true.

2374
02:59:36,680 --> 02:59:39,080
But they're giving us all this stuff for faith.

2375
02:59:39,760 --> 02:59:42,320
And nothing to use it on, you know?

2376
02:59:43,420 --> 02:59:44,640
Three, two, one, hoi!

2377
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:46,840
Oh, three, two, one, hoi!

2378
02:59:48,140 --> 02:59:49,100
A mantis.

2379
02:59:49,980 --> 02:59:53,320
Slightly restores health after each successful counter.

2380
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:00,680
Yeti eyes.

2381
03:00:01,100 --> 03:00:01,500
Oh, whoops.

2382
03:00:01,860 --> 03:00:03,040
Yeti eyes.

2383
03:00:05,300 --> 03:00:07,800
Yeti eyes tell Yeti lies.

2384
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:11,040
Wait, does it show up on the map now?

2385
03:00:12,460 --> 03:00:13,620
I can't tell, actually.

2386
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:17,240
Psycho Mantis.

2387
03:00:22,460 --> 03:00:23,240
Oh, it dies.

2388
03:00:23,380 --> 03:00:24,220
It's just hard to tell.

2389
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:25,480
Oh, neat.

2390
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:27,580
Are there any other rooms?

2391
03:00:29,800 --> 03:00:33,240
I don't think there was anything else that... Did I save?

2392
03:00:33,740 --> 03:00:34,440
I don't think I did.

2393
03:00:34,760 --> 03:00:35,060
Hold on.

2394
03:00:38,700 --> 03:00:41,980
I don't know if there were any other rooms that...

2395
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:46,860
Um...

2396
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:48,140
That I needed to open.

2397
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:48,620
Oh my god.

2398
03:00:48,740 --> 03:00:48,840
Oops.

2399
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:50,060
That's not what I meant to do.

2400
03:00:51,060 --> 03:00:51,340
Eh.

2401
03:00:53,460 --> 03:00:54,340
Psycho Mantis!

2402
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:56,200
Metal Gear Natskashi!

2403
03:01:00,200 --> 03:01:00,640
Well...

2404
03:01:08,620 --> 03:01:14,460
I think we can just go.

2405
03:01:16,600 --> 03:01:16,900
Unless?

2406
03:01:21,070 --> 03:01:23,890
Oh, the blue flame is out.

2407
03:01:24,430 --> 03:01:24,750
Neat.

2408
03:01:25,450 --> 03:01:26,530
Okay, this one wasn't.

2409
03:01:26,690 --> 03:01:27,570
But we did hear something.

2410
03:01:27,790 --> 03:01:28,110
Oh, wait.

2411
03:01:28,190 --> 03:01:30,670
No, I think what we heard behind it was the thing upstairs.

2412
03:01:31,830 --> 03:01:32,530
Okay, let's just go.

2413
03:01:33,630 --> 03:01:35,450
He's gotta be here, right?

2414
03:01:38,990 --> 03:01:41,110
Oh, there he is!

2415
03:01:52,210 --> 03:01:52,810
Whoa,

2416
03:02:00,610 --> 03:02:01,450
is this a wedding?

2417
03:02:02,390 --> 03:02:05,210
Is it a wedding?

2418
03:02:06,430 --> 03:02:07,610
Oh my gosh, whoa!

2419
03:02:09,130 --> 03:02:09,830
Look at her.

2420
03:02:17,100 --> 03:02:17,660
Oh,

2421
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:21,740
I can look around.

2422
03:02:33,860 --> 03:02:36,640
Look at all the foxes.

2423
03:02:41,630 --> 03:02:43,690
Why was that one lady so cool looking?

2424
03:02:47,810 --> 03:02:48,930
My sister.

2425
03:02:51,990 --> 03:02:53,170
This doesn't seem so bad.

2426
03:02:53,330 --> 03:02:53,950
What's the issue?

2427
03:02:55,990 --> 03:02:59,070
Yeah, one of those masks is not like the other at all.

2428
03:03:10,990 --> 03:03:12,310
Seems kind of nice.

2429
03:03:30,510 --> 03:03:31,070
Wow.

2430
03:03:32,010 --> 03:03:33,210
Oh, the spines.

2431
03:03:38,700 --> 03:03:39,800
So cool.

2432
03:03:55,230 --> 03:03:58,530
Oh, they're fast.

2433
03:03:58,850 --> 03:03:59,510
They're quiet.

2434
03:04:04,450 --> 03:04:09,110
Why are the guys have half masks and the ladies have full masks?

2435
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:19,640
Remember your name is Shimizu Hinako!

2436
03:04:28,220 --> 03:04:29,040
Uh-oh.

2437
03:04:29,560 --> 03:04:30,920
That doesn't look so good.

2438
03:04:31,220 --> 03:04:32,420
Wait, is that gonna hurt?

2439
03:04:33,320 --> 03:04:34,000
Holy!

2440
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:45,080
Wait, this is Rinko?

2441
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:50,160
Oh no, oh no.

2442
03:04:51,240 --> 03:04:52,920
She became lover.

2443
03:05:10,500 --> 03:05:12,420
Holy cow.

2444
03:05:12,480 --> 03:05:13,800
Oh no!

2445
03:05:14,300 --> 03:05:16,800
You got my fur.

2446
03:05:26,700 --> 03:05:28,620
Say it.

2447
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:29,400
Say it.

2448
03:05:29,880 --> 03:05:30,620
Say it!

2449
03:05:30,620 --> 03:05:31,200
Hinako!

2450
03:05:35,360 --> 03:05:37,680
Oh shoot, okay.

2451
03:05:47,240 --> 03:05:48,680
Wrinkle-like...

2452
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:49,600
Oh, wait!

2453
03:05:51,620 --> 03:05:53,960
Wait, I didn't realize I was in beast mode.

2454
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:03,500
Ouch, ouch.

2455
03:06:19,720 --> 03:06:21,840
Okay, I tried running.

2456
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:26,860
Ah, dodge, dodge, dodge!

2457
03:06:27,060 --> 03:06:27,960
Oh, she...

2458
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:31,440
Oh, oh, my...

2459
03:06:31,440 --> 03:06:32,600
Ah, my health!

2460
03:06:32,820 --> 03:06:33,620
My health run away!

2461
03:06:36,860 --> 03:06:38,120
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot!

2462
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:39,540
Wait, there's like, people coming at me!

2463
03:06:40,060 --> 03:06:41,500
Oh my gosh, wait, I need a bandage.

2464
03:06:43,820 --> 03:06:45,120
Omoe it all!

2465
03:06:45,460 --> 03:06:46,120
Omoe it all!

2466
03:06:53,830 --> 03:06:54,590
Ouch, I'll choke.

2467
03:07:01,490 --> 03:07:03,930
Oh shoot, uh, we need to run.

2468
03:07:10,460 --> 03:07:11,180
The puppets.

2469
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:13,300
Holy cow!

2470
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:14,840
They scared me!

2471
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:16,700
Oh, they're like little bombs!

2472
03:07:17,480 --> 03:07:18,320
Wait, I can't see it.

2473
03:07:19,100 --> 03:07:19,420
Oh shoot.

2474
03:07:20,380 --> 03:07:21,400
Okay, okay, hold on.

2475
03:07:21,980 --> 03:07:23,120
Uh, eat?

2476
03:07:23,440 --> 03:07:23,620
Okay.

2477
03:07:39,420 --> 03:07:40,120
Oh, shoot.

2478
03:07:41,140 --> 03:07:42,240
Can I soul-siphon it?

2479
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:43,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2480
03:07:44,280 --> 03:07:45,220
I was pressing the wrong thing.

2481
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:45,840
Oh, I can.

2482
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:48,560
Wait, that's kind of awesome.

2483
03:07:49,340 --> 03:07:49,520
Ah!

2484
03:07:49,880 --> 03:07:51,360
I kept pressing the wrong thing.

2485
03:07:51,460 --> 03:07:52,140
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2486
03:07:53,540 --> 03:07:54,160
Wait, please.

2487
03:07:54,520 --> 03:07:55,120
Please, bandage.

2488
03:07:58,380 --> 03:07:58,780
Okay.

2489
03:07:59,700 --> 03:08:00,100
Okay.

2490
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:03,100
Maybe...

2491
03:08:03,580 --> 03:08:05,920
Ah, I need to kill them before...

2492
03:08:27,300 --> 03:08:28,740
Oh, I'm gaming?

2493
03:08:40,420 --> 03:08:41,540
Okay, uh...

2494
03:08:41,540 --> 03:08:45,620
I need to leave you, please!

2495
03:08:46,460 --> 03:08:50,020
Okay, I got this...

2496
03:08:50,020 --> 03:08:51,500
Oh, that's not where I want to go!

2497
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:01,780
Oh, nice, nice.

2498
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:03,000
Oh, no, no, no!

2499
03:09:03,300 --> 03:09:04,140
The worst timing!

2500
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:08,340
Ouchy, ouchy, ouchy, ouchy, ouchy, ouchy

2501
03:09:13,640 --> 03:09:15,400
Okay, I'm running again.

2502
03:09:15,940 --> 03:09:17,840
And I'm full healing.

2503
03:09:25,280 --> 03:09:27,720
Oh shoot, oh gosh, ah!

2504
03:09:28,420 --> 03:09:30,720
Oh, I'm getting combo, wapo comboed!

2505
03:09:32,240 --> 03:09:34,780
Oh wait, my arm is... my arm is normal, okay.

2506
03:09:37,940 --> 03:09:38,980
Pull my...

2507
03:09:39,040 --> 03:09:39,640
Trigger.

2508
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:44,360
Oh, we got her!

2509
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:46,580
Oh, we got her!

2510
03:09:46,580 --> 03:09:46,720
Oh, DT!

2511
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:53,140
Wait, is she in the cutscene with the giant in your?

2512
03:10:17,460 --> 03:10:18,760
I'll be honest.

2513
03:10:19,360 --> 03:10:21,080
I could barely pay attention to what they were saying.

2514
03:10:22,160 --> 03:10:23,120
So I have no idea.

2515
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:31,740
Damn.

2516
03:10:40,100 --> 03:10:42,920
Are we going back to...

2517
03:10:44,660 --> 03:10:44,680
...

2518
03:10:44,680 --> 03:10:44,700
...

2519
03:10:50,600 --> 03:10:51,320
That's my name!

2520
03:10:51,420 --> 03:10:52,280
Don't wear it out!

2521
03:10:54,080 --> 03:10:54,760
...

2522
03:10:54,760 --> 03:10:54,940
...

2523
03:11:02,680 --> 03:11:03,060
Shimizu.

2524
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:04,140
Shimizu.

2525
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:05,160
Shimizu.

2526
03:11:05,160 --> 03:11:05,460
I...

2527
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:08,160
Shimizu.

2528
03:11:08,900 --> 03:11:09,220
Hinaiko.

2529
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:10,180
J-a-nai.

2530
03:11:10,460 --> 03:11:11,040
What's up?

2531
03:11:11,340 --> 03:11:11,740
Hinaiko.

2532
03:11:12,240 --> 03:11:12,960
I...

2533
03:11:12,960 --> 03:11:13,820
I...

2534
03:11:13,820 --> 03:11:15,040
You're Hinaiko, jane-a.

2535
03:11:15,180 --> 03:11:15,940
I...

2536
03:11:15,940 --> 03:11:17,220
You're Hinaiko.

2537
03:11:18,240 --> 03:11:20,320
Wait, she's even saying it too though?

2538
03:11:20,980 --> 03:11:21,320
Yes.

2539
03:11:23,970 --> 03:11:24,730
I...

2540
03:11:26,970 --> 03:11:27,730
Shimizu.

2541
03:11:27,950 --> 03:11:28,570
Hina...

2542
03:11:29,090 --> 03:11:29,830
Janai.

2543
03:11:30,650 --> 03:11:31,030
Janai?

2544
03:11:31,550 --> 03:11:32,070
No!

2545
03:11:32,070 --> 03:11:32,390
Oh,

2546
03:11:36,670 --> 03:11:38,750
they took her last name.

2547
03:11:39,270 --> 03:11:40,550
She's just Hinako.

2548
03:11:42,730 --> 03:11:43,030
Oh.

2549
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:50,040
Yeah, he's leaving the Shimizu out.

2550
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:54,400
The fox looking at her.

2551
03:11:54,880 --> 03:11:56,640
Creepy plucked wings.

2552
03:11:56,920 --> 03:11:58,000
Anything for you?

2553
03:11:58,180 --> 03:12:00,400
Is it the achievement I got?

2554
03:12:00,780 --> 03:12:01,360
Oh, no!

2555
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:03,020
My arm!

2556
03:12:04,300 --> 03:12:07,640
The back of the uniform is all messed up still though.

2557
03:12:09,180 --> 03:12:12,440
What happens in the game happens in real life.

2558
03:12:16,350 --> 03:12:20,590
Yeah, he's calling her just Hinako, but she is trying to be Shimizu Hinako.

2559
03:12:29,080 --> 03:12:29,680
Oshimaoshi.

2560
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:31,760
Hi.

2561
03:12:36,250 --> 03:12:38,550
Who could be calling at this hour?

2562
03:12:40,530 --> 03:12:42,210
Okay, please answer.

2563
03:12:42,450 --> 03:12:43,350
It's so loud.

2564
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:48,400
Yes?

2565
03:12:49,440 --> 03:12:50,540
Shimizu residence?

2566
03:12:51,640 --> 03:12:54,780
Please, please answer the phone.

2567
03:12:55,020 --> 03:12:55,880
It's so loud.

2568
03:12:57,440 --> 03:12:58,280
Oh, thank you.

2569
03:13:00,160 --> 03:13:03,740
Oh, Kai-san?

2570
03:13:03,980 --> 03:13:05,440
Oh, Kai-san?

2571
03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:13,040
Oh,

2572
03:13:19,290 --> 03:13:19,290
creepy!

2573
03:13:24,050 --> 03:13:25,550
It's her sister.

2574
03:13:28,410 --> 03:13:29,570
I don't know!

2575
03:13:30,610 --> 03:13:31,030
Me too.

2576
03:13:32,310 --> 03:13:33,270
Oh,

2577
03:13:36,650 --> 03:13:37,410
she doesn't look so good.

2578
03:13:40,710 --> 03:13:41,910
What does...

2579
03:13:41,910 --> 03:13:43,290
Yeah, something doesn't seem right.

2580
03:13:43,470 --> 03:13:45,410
It's just...

2581
03:13:48,470 --> 03:13:51,410
Oh, no black hair.

2582
03:13:56,350 --> 03:13:56,630
Oh.

2583
03:13:56,630 --> 03:13:56,870
Oh.

2584
03:14:02,050 --> 03:14:02,650
Oh.

2585
03:14:03,870 --> 03:14:04,470
Oh.

2586
03:14:04,470 --> 03:14:04,490
Oh.

2587
03:14:04,490 --> 03:14:05,050
No black hair.

2588
03:14:05,210 --> 03:14:05,250
Oh.

2589
03:14:06,230 --> 03:14:06,670
Oh.

2590
03:14:07,410 --> 03:14:08,530
Don't worry.

2591
03:14:11,490 --> 03:14:13,410
Hi Kiwawa!

2592
03:14:16,230 --> 03:14:17,890
I hope you had fun with Pokemon.

2593
03:14:22,550 --> 03:14:24,430
I'll be true to the thumbnail.

2594
03:14:31,010 --> 03:14:33,830
I'll be true to the thumbnail.

2595
03:14:33,830 --> 03:14:49,030
You can always have a lick, Colonel.

2596
03:14:57,910 --> 03:14:59,930
How could you lose her?

2597
03:15:00,350 --> 03:15:03,210
Her little bell was clanking away.

2598
03:15:03,890 --> 03:15:05,210
How could you lose her?

2599
03:15:07,330 --> 03:15:09,750
Thank you so much for the redirect, Kiwawa!

2600
03:15:10,930 --> 03:15:15,070
I almost said Kiara and then I wanted to say Kiwawa, so I said Ki-rarwa.

2601
03:15:19,170 --> 03:15:22,170
Make your way down the mountain and head to the Shimizu residence.

2602
03:15:23,090 --> 03:15:23,950
Oh, that was freaky!

2603
03:15:29,390 --> 03:15:30,970
Let's read our journal.

2604
03:15:31,610 --> 03:15:31,990
Rar!

2605
03:15:33,270 --> 03:15:34,230
Ki-rarwa!

2606
03:15:35,110 --> 03:15:35,590
Rar!

2607
03:15:38,850 --> 03:15:43,390
Hi everybody, we're playing Silent Hill F and...

2608
03:15:44,290 --> 03:15:45,850
Oh, it's a little freaky.

2609
03:15:46,650 --> 03:15:49,230
Um, I just beat a lava lady.

2610
03:15:53,240 --> 03:15:53,720
What?

2611
03:15:53,960 --> 03:15:55,100
Wait, hold on.

2612
03:15:55,960 --> 03:15:57,120
Is there a cat in here?

2613
03:16:00,260 --> 03:16:04,200
Hold on, let me check if there's a cat in my room because my window was open.

2614
03:16:05,260 --> 03:16:06,700
I'm freaked out.

2615
03:16:06,780 --> 03:16:07,200
What?

2616
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:08,160
How was that possible?

2617
03:16:29,790 --> 03:16:31,550
There's no cat in my room.

2618
03:16:32,330 --> 03:16:33,470
How is my window like that?

2619
03:16:35,530 --> 03:16:36,210
Oh, not the...

2620
03:16:36,210 --> 03:16:37,130
Sorry, my window...

2621
03:16:37,130 --> 03:16:38,290
It's not the window was open.

2622
03:16:38,650 --> 03:16:40,970
It's that, like, the curtains were...

2623
03:16:41,430 --> 03:16:45,190
The curtains were open in a way that, like, my cats pushed them aside.

2624
03:16:46,030 --> 03:16:48,790
But I had fixed them earlier, and then I looked and they were open.

2625
03:16:50,130 --> 03:16:51,570
But I didn't do that.

2626
03:16:51,850 --> 03:16:53,190
And there's no cat in here.

2627
03:16:55,030 --> 03:16:55,390
My...

2628
03:16:55,750 --> 03:16:57,510
My maid cafe is already haunted by me.

2629
03:16:57,670 --> 03:16:57,990
The campaign...

2630
03:16:57,990 --> 03:16:59,250
Well, if it's a ghost cat, it's fine.

2631
03:16:59,270 --> 03:17:54,890
if it's a ghost cat it's fine nothing gets on my nerves more than other people trying to make decisions for me even if what they're saying is right it just rubs me the wrong way i'd rather make a hundred mistakes on my own than follow someone else's commands you know what i kind of i kind of get it you know i'm like kind of stubborn like that too where someone will be like jump vtuber and i'm like i know you're telling me to jump but you're telling me what to do and i to you but that can make for a lonely life oh where one where i refuse to listen to anyone else oh wait i want to become the kind of person who truly listens to what others have to say oh wait oh god wait they're saying that i'm wrong of course it'll still be up to me whom i listen to okay

2632
03:17:59,930 --> 03:18:05,610
And that will be someone I can trust, someone who will walk alongside me, hand in hand.

2633
03:18:06,090 --> 03:18:11,030
However, making long lists of things I hate is just a way of running away from the real issue I have with my inner self.

2634
03:18:11,410 --> 03:18:15,110
I have to step up and face what's inside of me, even if I don't like what I see.

2635
03:18:15,570 --> 03:18:20,830
Being able to take my time and carefully think things through before making a decision is what's most important to me.

2636
03:18:21,030 --> 03:18:22,990
Oh, I get it, I get it.

2637
03:18:24,570 --> 03:18:28,090
Oh, wait, her face changed to show the mask.

2638
03:18:30,970 --> 03:18:31,770
Diagonal Vtuber.

2639
03:18:32,030 --> 03:18:32,210
Ah!

2640
03:18:35,650 --> 03:18:41,470
Junko always told me that the quickest way to happiness is to live the way society expects women to.

2641
03:18:42,590 --> 03:18:45,750
Well, if there's a quick way to happiness, then there must be other ways too.

2642
03:18:46,490 --> 03:18:51,150
One time when I was little, Junko showed me how to find my way out of a maze in a puzzle book.

2643
03:18:51,810 --> 03:18:54,170
There's no doubt that she showed me the quickest solution.

2644
03:18:54,630 --> 03:18:58,830
Still, what I felt at that moment was nothing compared to the joy of figuring it out for myself.

2645
03:18:59,370 --> 03:18:59,850
Aww.

2646
03:19:00,810 --> 03:19:02,570
Wait, does Rinko change at all?

2647
03:19:03,090 --> 03:19:04,390
Oh, we didn't see Shu either!

2648
03:19:04,890 --> 03:19:05,550
Oh, no!

2649
03:19:06,490 --> 03:19:06,970
Shu!

2650
03:19:08,870 --> 03:19:10,650
Sakakos makes me the most sad, though.

2651
03:19:10,970 --> 03:19:12,430
I love her.

2652
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:16,010
Uh...

2653
03:19:16,010 --> 03:19:17,290
Fox Mask.

2654
03:19:18,390 --> 03:19:20,570
His portrait hasn't really changed much, though.

2655
03:19:22,110 --> 03:19:24,850
He promised me everything I could ever want to be content.

2656
03:19:25,030 --> 03:19:27,570
A life full of comfort for as long as I live.

2657
03:19:27,930 --> 03:19:57,670
Status that no one could look like down on and most importantly endless love for me for all this i will give him all of me body mind and soul i will even give him what i have fiercely protected my whole life my will to make my own choices from now on i will let him decide everything for me and simply do as he says this is what happiness means to me oh my gosh i don't know if you remember but a few days ago i mentioned I applied for a promotion,

2658
03:19:57,790 --> 03:19:58,370
I got good news.

2659
03:19:59,110 --> 03:20:00,750
I got an interview for it by day.

2660
03:20:00,950 --> 03:20:02,130
So the sky!

2661
03:20:03,190 --> 03:20:03,670
Congratulations!

2662
03:20:04,290 --> 03:20:04,530
Yo!

2663
03:20:04,730 --> 03:20:06,430
Oh my gosh, you'll totally get it.

2664
03:20:07,050 --> 03:20:08,550
You'll totally get it.

2665
03:20:08,910 --> 03:20:09,690
Whoa, look at it.

2666
03:20:09,810 --> 03:20:11,010
We got the Yeti arm.

2667
03:20:11,550 --> 03:20:12,710
Wait, we look so cool.

2668
03:20:15,250 --> 03:20:16,330
Mom looks same.

2669
03:20:17,310 --> 03:20:18,170
Dad looks same.

2670
03:20:20,510 --> 03:20:20,970
Nice.

2671
03:20:23,110 --> 03:20:25,110
All right, let's see where we're headed to.

2672
03:20:26,350 --> 03:20:27,790
the mountain and head to Shimizu residence.

2673
03:20:27,950 --> 03:20:28,590
Where was that?

2674
03:20:29,510 --> 03:20:30,290
Where do I live?

2675
03:20:31,810 --> 03:20:32,690
I am...

2676
03:20:32,690 --> 03:20:35,010
Actually, don't we live up here?

2677
03:20:35,330 --> 03:20:36,710
Oh my gosh!

2678
03:20:37,470 --> 03:20:37,970
Wait a second!

2679
03:20:38,450 --> 03:20:40,490
I should be able... I should head up the mountain!

2680
03:20:41,570 --> 03:20:41,670
No?

2681
03:20:43,670 --> 03:20:45,610
Sounds like we should be doing the opposite.

2682
03:20:49,590 --> 03:20:55,870
Yeah, actually, we are...

2683
03:20:56,350 --> 03:20:57,550
It's getting dark.

2684
03:20:58,090 --> 03:20:59,770
It's getting pretty dark outside.

2685
03:21:00,970 --> 03:21:01,350
Oh, wait.

2686
03:21:01,470 --> 03:21:02,330
I just went...

2687
03:21:02,330 --> 03:21:02,730
Okay.

2688
03:21:04,430 --> 03:21:08,290
I was gonna check and see if this way was open, but it turns out it is now.

2689
03:21:09,590 --> 03:21:10,230
Very cool.

2690
03:21:12,330 --> 03:21:13,650
I missed my Yeti arm.

2691
03:21:15,990 --> 03:21:17,590
I miss it very much.

2692
03:21:18,370 --> 03:21:19,250
Just got hope for work.

2693
03:21:19,510 --> 03:21:19,670
Today's...

2694
03:21:19,670 --> 03:21:20,770
Her triggers!

2695
03:21:21,110 --> 03:21:22,110
Happy birthday!

2696
03:21:28,780 --> 03:21:29,620
I'm happy to...

2697
03:21:29,640 --> 03:21:31,820
to be here for another year with you and the wisps.

2698
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:34,160
Thank you!

2699
03:21:35,660 --> 03:21:37,680
Thank you so much!

2700
03:21:42,220 --> 03:21:44,240
So many birthdays today!

2701
03:21:44,460 --> 03:21:44,720
Wow!

2702
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:48,860
All right, Shemizu Residence.

2703
03:21:49,100 --> 03:21:50,180
But this is going up.

2704
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:54,440
This seems like the corrective defraction, no?

2705
03:21:56,760 --> 03:21:59,300
Well, my game is starting to lag a little bit, sorry.

2706
03:22:02,640 --> 03:22:04,660
The little fox is so cute.

2707
03:22:14,140 --> 03:22:14,620
Um.

2708
03:22:15,660 --> 03:22:16,900
What the heck was that?

2709
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:18,680
Um.

2710
03:22:19,440 --> 03:22:20,960
That don't sound so good.

2711
03:22:21,820 --> 03:22:25,240
And I saw that there was a baseball bat, but I don't think we need to switch anything out.

2712
03:22:25,580 --> 03:22:26,160
What I have.

2713
03:22:31,260 --> 03:22:32,720
I don't like what I heard.

2714
03:22:37,630 --> 03:22:40,310
We're back to being vulnerable and I don't like that.

2715
03:22:41,470 --> 03:22:43,830
Wait, can I even go around that way?

2716
03:22:44,390 --> 03:22:46,190
Hold on, sorry, I'm...

2717
03:22:46,190 --> 03:22:47,510
Wait, let's go down.

2718
03:22:47,690 --> 03:22:49,410
I want to see what's down there.

2719
03:22:52,450 --> 03:22:53,250
I'm not even sure.

2720
03:22:53,450 --> 03:22:55,810
It's feeling very silent hill now.

2721
03:23:06,720 --> 03:23:09,860
Where did I... I know... Oh, I saw these things in the other world.

2722
03:23:11,780 --> 03:23:15,240
In October to November birthday means you were likely a Valentine's Day gift.

2723
03:23:18,580 --> 03:23:19,560
Hello, hello!

2724
03:23:20,240 --> 03:23:21,660
Oh, yeah, yo, yo.

2725
03:23:33,710 --> 03:23:37,570
Oh, I thought she was gonna run up.

2726
03:23:39,810 --> 03:23:40,450
My bad.

2727
03:23:40,910 --> 03:23:42,390
I thought she was...

2728
03:23:42,390 --> 03:23:43,490
I mean, she did run up.

2729
03:23:43,770 --> 03:23:45,130
I just miscalculated it.

2730
03:23:53,690 --> 03:23:54,250
Sorry.

2731
03:24:02,100 --> 03:24:03,880
Oh, use focus.

2732
03:24:04,200 --> 03:24:06,200
I said...

2733
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:14,200
The map is like tripping me out because I can't... I'm like...

2734
03:24:14,720 --> 03:24:16,500
I'm surprised this isn't going.

2735
03:24:19,320 --> 03:24:23,080
Because I can't get my bearings on like the... Oh, okay.

2736
03:24:23,860 --> 03:24:26,000
It's more like slanted to the left.

2737
03:24:26,700 --> 03:24:27,020
Okay.

2738
03:24:29,980 --> 03:24:31,400
I can't go inside here, right?

2739
03:24:31,740 --> 03:24:32,540
Okay, thank goodness.

2740
03:24:37,260 --> 03:24:39,140
Hello everybody, getting off of work?

2741
03:24:40,080 --> 03:24:40,540
And such?

2742
03:24:41,920 --> 03:24:43,300
You think there's somebody in there?

2743
03:24:46,920 --> 03:24:48,680
That's a creaky house.

2744
03:24:50,460 --> 03:24:51,740
This house do be creaking.

2745
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:54,380
Oh, it's actually really big.

2746
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:56,220
Way bigger than I thought.

2747
03:25:03,030 --> 03:25:04,590
I'm going to work.

2748
03:25:05,310 --> 03:25:07,070
Have a good day of work!

2749
03:25:08,310 --> 03:25:10,110
Have a good day of work.

2750
03:25:11,310 --> 03:25:13,370
Uh, peels here.

2751
03:25:14,310 --> 03:25:15,310
I don't trust it.

2752
03:25:15,710 --> 03:25:16,450
Do I need the peels?

2753
03:25:21,220 --> 03:25:22,080
I think I'm...

2754
03:25:22,080 --> 03:25:23,220
I have seven peels.

2755
03:25:24,300 --> 03:25:26,360
Wait, how many pills is the max pills?

2756
03:25:30,440 --> 03:25:31,720
I don't know.

2757
03:25:33,160 --> 03:25:33,760
I think we're okay.

2758
03:25:35,160 --> 03:25:36,000
Ten peels!

2759
03:25:36,280 --> 03:25:37,580
Okay, I'll take the peels.

2760
03:25:38,820 --> 03:25:39,900
I'm scared for it, though.

2761
03:25:40,380 --> 03:25:41,300
I'm ready to dodge.

2762
03:25:44,260 --> 03:25:45,260
Okay, good dodge.

2763
03:25:50,740 --> 03:25:53,740
I once had 48 pills in my inventory.

2764
03:25:54,040 --> 03:25:54,660
No way!

2765
03:25:55,760 --> 03:25:57,080
Do I take them too often?

2766
03:25:57,960 --> 03:26:00,880
It's starting to get kind of icky around here.

2767
03:26:01,500 --> 03:26:02,780
What's that speaker for?

2768
03:26:03,420 --> 03:26:05,140
Is that a speaker or satellite?

2769
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:06,840
I'm actually not sure.

2770
03:26:08,100 --> 03:26:09,340
Ooh, we're starting to get...

2771
03:26:09,340 --> 03:26:09,520
Oh.

2772
03:26:10,440 --> 03:26:12,600
My game is really lagging sometimes, huh?

2773
03:26:14,260 --> 03:26:19,420
Okay, we can't go through that way, but I can take their stuff.

2774
03:26:21,440 --> 03:26:22,860
And I for sure will do that.

2775
03:26:30,930 --> 03:26:31,490
Clinical trial.

2776
03:26:32,130 --> 03:26:34,370
I began taking this medicine out of desperation.

2777
03:26:35,090 --> 03:26:38,210
My first impression was that it smells of peaches and is faintly sweet.

2778
03:26:38,550 --> 03:26:40,790
That's the thing we read about earlier, the miracle drug.

2779
03:26:41,590 --> 03:26:45,690
After taking it before bed for the past three nights, I had my first lucid dream.

2780
03:26:46,070 --> 03:26:49,170
For a whole night, I was able to organize my thoughts in a pleasant darkness.

2781
03:26:49,850 --> 03:26:53,230
Sounds like my worst nightmare.

2782
03:26:56,510 --> 03:27:02,550
Was this what the tale meant when they said, sorry, I can't read.

2783
03:27:02,890 --> 03:27:07,270
Was this what the tales meant when they said the drug allows you to speak with your inner self?

2784
03:27:07,970 --> 03:27:11,530
I've heard of taking vitamin B6 makes it easier to remember dreams.

2785
03:27:12,010 --> 03:27:12,590
Is that true?

2786
03:27:14,570 --> 03:27:19,210
However, I'm sure its effectiveness depends on factors like dosage and body composition.

2787
03:27:19,850 --> 03:27:22,330
At any rate, this has been a letdown so far.

2788
03:27:23,810 --> 03:27:24,190
Okay.

2789
03:27:24,610 --> 03:27:25,530
What are you trying to do?

2790
03:27:27,450 --> 03:27:29,040
I think we can just step on it.

2791
03:27:32,630 --> 03:27:33,130
A rope.

2792
03:27:35,130 --> 03:27:37,570
A part of me thought that was going to strangle me.

2793
03:27:38,070 --> 03:27:40,030
Like in half-life.

2794
03:27:40,170 --> 03:27:41,410
I was going to...

2795
03:27:44,590 --> 03:27:45,670
No way!

2796
03:27:47,010 --> 03:27:47,550
What?

2797
03:27:47,970 --> 03:27:48,990
We have the...

2798
03:27:48,990 --> 03:27:49,830
We have the...

2799
03:27:49,830 --> 03:27:51,230
The titty lady here!

2800
03:27:52,210 --> 03:28:19,390
why why why okay we're gonna have to get past her oh my god the who you guys you have to see her I'm not making her up here actually I could show you that's the titty lady.

2801
03:28:23,190 --> 03:28:24,170
That's her.

2802
03:28:28,330 --> 03:28:28,850
Oh, wait.

2803
03:28:30,230 --> 03:28:33,890
A monster that has a large taiko drum inside its mouth.

2804
03:28:34,150 --> 03:28:34,530
How cute.

2805
03:28:35,270 --> 03:28:41,690
It swings around its large bachi drumstick like arms and strengths the taiko to instill fear and command those bound to it.

2806
03:28:42,070 --> 03:28:44,590
It tries to cancel out any noise with its loud voice and banging.

2807
03:28:44,930 --> 03:28:45,590
That's how it's always been.

2808
03:28:45,630 --> 03:28:47,450
I killed it so fast I didn't even notice.

2809
03:28:47,830 --> 03:28:48,690
She's perfect.

2810
03:28:50,610 --> 03:29:21,710
beat Sakuko and now we have Rinko a monster that has taken the form of a head priest it sounds just like Rinko swinging around and Onusa stuff used for purification rituals this creature is consumed by the fires of jealousy or the fires that I literally I literally dropped her into lava but you know remains surrounded by babbling puppets there's no way Rinko is a monster like this But this is her,

2811
03:29:21,950 --> 03:29:22,930
without a doubt.

2812
03:29:27,510 --> 03:29:28,610
If I'm looking...

2813
03:29:30,850 --> 03:29:32,790
Okay, I'm looking at the monster.

2814
03:29:33,610 --> 03:29:33,930
Sorry.

2815
03:29:34,110 --> 03:29:37,290
I don't know why the map is suddenly, like, tripping me up.

2816
03:29:39,970 --> 03:29:41,890
Okay, I need to go over that way.

2817
03:29:43,330 --> 03:29:44,450
But what's over this way?

2818
03:29:47,730 --> 03:29:48,450
You know?

2819
03:29:53,360 --> 03:29:54,120
It's fine.

2820
03:29:54,300 --> 03:29:54,880
I'll just run.

2821
03:29:57,320 --> 03:29:58,180
Oh, can I?

2822
03:29:59,940 --> 03:30:01,120
Defeat the monsters!

2823
03:30:01,440 --> 03:30:02,680
Wait, I can't run!

2824
03:30:04,780 --> 03:30:05,300
Okay.

2825
03:30:06,360 --> 03:30:09,540
Well, um, no way.

2826
03:30:09,740 --> 03:30:10,640
No stinking way.

2827
03:30:15,040 --> 03:30:17,740
Uh, because that's where I need to...

2828
03:30:17,740 --> 03:30:19,480
That, I think, is... Hold on, sorry.

2829
03:30:19,720 --> 03:30:20,120
Okay, yeah.

2830
03:30:24,220 --> 03:30:27,780
Oh, here she comes.

2831
03:30:33,140 --> 03:30:35,080
Oh, she's gross.

2832
03:30:41,140 --> 03:30:41,700
Oh,

2833
03:30:45,140 --> 03:30:46,120
I miss my arm.

2834
03:30:47,840 --> 03:30:48,660
I miss my arm.

2835
03:30:50,920 --> 03:30:53,870
Ouch, out, out, out.

2836
03:30:57,680 --> 03:30:58,820
Oh, she's burning.

2837
03:30:58,840 --> 03:30:59,880
I'm birthing another one!

2838
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:05,040
Which is...

2839
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:06,480
Oh, there's two of them!

2840
03:31:10,790 --> 03:31:12,850
Oh, she's birthing another one!

2841
03:31:13,110 --> 03:31:14,290
Oh my gosh, I'm out of stamina.

2842
03:31:15,890 --> 03:31:17,170
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2843
03:31:24,570 --> 03:31:25,670
Oh, I got it.

2844
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:30,760
Come here, lady.

2845
03:31:31,080 --> 03:31:31,520
Oh, no.

2846
03:31:32,100 --> 03:31:32,620
This one.

2847
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:33,800
Let's kill it.

2848
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:36,860
Oh, it exploded!

2849
03:31:37,220 --> 03:31:37,440
Okay.

2850
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:42,580
Oh, gosh, ouch.

2851
03:31:42,700 --> 03:31:47,160
Oh, stop it.

2852
03:31:47,880 --> 03:31:48,840
Stop birthing.

2853
03:32:00,240 --> 03:32:02,380
I thought I killed her, but I...

2854
03:32:04,340 --> 03:32:05,300
Oh, get out of...

2855
03:32:05,300 --> 03:32:06,360
Oh, I have no stamina.

2856
03:32:06,780 --> 03:32:07,600
I have no stamina.

2857
03:32:07,900 --> 03:32:08,460
Wait, I'm...

2858
03:32:08,460 --> 03:32:10,000
Wait, it keeps, like, trapping me.

2859
03:32:10,120 --> 03:32:10,680
That's so weird.

2860
03:32:11,340 --> 03:32:11,560
Okay.

2861
03:32:12,280 --> 03:32:45,400
please stop birth oh my gosh okay hold on I'll take another one more pills okay so the blue ones just explode oh geez no No!

2862
03:32:52,300 --> 03:32:52,780
Oh,

2863
03:33:01,990 --> 03:33:02,530
that sucks.

2864
03:33:03,230 --> 03:33:07,830
Oh, come on, I pressed B, but not fast enough, I think.

2865
03:33:08,350 --> 03:33:10,090
No, my crowbar!

2866
03:33:11,410 --> 03:33:12,790
I'm trying not to get exploded.

2867
03:33:16,250 --> 03:33:17,970
It got stuck on its own thing.

2868
03:33:27,170 --> 03:33:32,270
Oh man, my crowbar.

2869
03:33:32,850 --> 03:33:33,010
Ah!

2870
03:33:37,700 --> 03:33:38,400
Microbar!

2871
03:33:48,380 --> 03:33:51,180
So lucky!

2872
03:33:56,690 --> 03:33:58,730
What are you showing me now?

2873
03:34:03,660 --> 03:34:08,120
A hideous monster covered in countless skin cysts.

2874
03:34:08,660 --> 03:34:16,140
He spawns monster after monster from its dreadful smelling clumps of flesh it drops.

2875
03:34:16,440 --> 03:34:17,520
Filthy, foul, and repulsive.

2876
03:34:18,200 --> 03:34:20,540
The wonders of birth do not apply to this.

2877
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:24,060
Everyone agrees.

2878
03:34:29,220 --> 03:34:30,220
All right.

2879
03:34:30,880 --> 03:34:32,280
Heading back home.

2880
03:34:36,920 --> 03:34:37,460
Okay.

2881
03:34:44,050 --> 03:34:47,610
It did auto-save, but I could use another save port.

2882
03:34:48,810 --> 03:34:49,530
Another radio.

2883
03:34:54,950 --> 03:34:56,290
Death, death, death.

2884
03:34:57,830 --> 03:34:59,890
I don't feel like going over there.

2885
03:35:05,550 --> 03:35:12,050
This does feel like the beginning of the game, sort of when we were going through like the area where we live.

2886
03:35:12,070 --> 03:35:12,470
in.

2887
03:35:16,170 --> 03:35:17,770
Except just more goofy.

2888
03:35:19,990 --> 03:35:22,470
This is something up here.

2889
03:35:26,870 --> 03:35:27,530
Something.

2890
03:35:28,690 --> 03:35:28,690
Perhaps.

2891
03:35:31,950 --> 03:35:32,350
Ah!

2892
03:35:36,650 --> 03:35:37,310
Ah!

2893
03:35:38,490 --> 03:35:39,530
Why?

2894
03:35:40,950 --> 03:35:41,310
Why?

2895
03:35:45,460 --> 03:35:47,480
Yeah, pick her out.

2896
03:35:48,340 --> 03:35:48,560
Oops.

2897
03:35:51,080 --> 03:35:52,660
Is there anything over here then?

2898
03:35:53,440 --> 03:35:54,140
There better be.

2899
03:35:54,560 --> 03:35:56,200
For me to get jump attacked?

2900
03:35:57,440 --> 03:35:58,400
Something in the...

2901
03:35:58,400 --> 03:35:59,640
There's got it...

2902
03:35:59,640 --> 03:35:59,980
There's something.

2903
03:36:00,300 --> 03:36:01,340
Oh, there is!

2904
03:36:03,380 --> 03:36:06,960
Oh, perfect dodges become easier to perform.

2905
03:36:08,320 --> 03:36:08,620
Interesting.

2906
03:36:09,280 --> 03:36:12,940
Right now, the omamari I have right now is for my stamina.

2907
03:36:18,840 --> 03:36:20,860
Oh, change it to the one that heals you.

2908
03:36:23,800 --> 03:36:24,240
after...

2909
03:36:25,160 --> 03:36:26,680
I guess we could.

2910
03:36:28,200 --> 03:36:29,500
Oh, I have the hawk, too.

2911
03:36:29,660 --> 03:36:29,960
I forgot.

2912
03:36:33,780 --> 03:36:34,780
What was it, Mantis?

2913
03:36:34,860 --> 03:36:35,100
No.

2914
03:36:35,460 --> 03:36:35,700
Crow?

2915
03:36:37,980 --> 03:36:39,740
I guess... Wait, what's my health at?

2916
03:36:39,820 --> 03:36:42,260
Yeah, actually it might be good to have it like that, huh?

2917
03:36:45,500 --> 03:36:46,580
What did I say?

2918
03:36:47,840 --> 03:36:49,060
What did I say?

2919
03:36:51,740 --> 03:36:53,320
Where are my going.

2920
03:36:56,920 --> 03:36:58,220
This seems suspicious.

2921
03:36:59,540 --> 03:36:59,740
Oh,

2922
03:37:04,840 --> 03:37:04,840
okay.

2923
03:37:05,900 --> 03:37:08,300
Oh, I said Hawk.

2924
03:37:09,740 --> 03:37:13,520
Space, space, space, space, space, space, space, space, space.

2925
03:37:13,840 --> 03:37:14,180
Two.

2926
03:37:18,860 --> 03:37:19,480
Uh.

2927
03:37:22,180 --> 03:37:23,040
Yeah.

2928
03:37:23,760 --> 03:37:25,780
Sorry, I'm getting mixed up a little.

2929
03:37:30,920 --> 03:37:31,480
Ew!

2930
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:33,720
Aw, you!

2931
03:37:34,540 --> 03:37:38,660
Okay, so, oh, that way is not possible and it shows on the map.

2932
03:37:43,280 --> 03:37:43,960
Um, hi!

2933
03:37:54,430 --> 03:37:54,990
Oh!

2934
03:37:56,970 --> 03:38:01,870
Also, I see something over there, so I think I'm just gonna book it.

2935
03:38:03,930 --> 03:38:04,490
Ah!

2936
03:38:04,730 --> 03:38:05,750
Are you kidding me?

2937
03:38:08,530 --> 03:38:10,470
I don't know if I'm going the right way or not.

2938
03:38:16,250 --> 03:38:17,170
I am?

2939
03:38:19,790 --> 03:38:20,610
I don't know.

2940
03:38:21,370 --> 03:38:22,580
I hear something behind me though.

2941
03:38:25,110 --> 03:38:26,470
I just realized...

2942
03:38:28,370 --> 03:38:30,480
I just realized that I went to...

2943
03:38:34,210 --> 03:38:34,670
Shimiko...

2944
03:38:34,670 --> 03:38:35,790
Wait, what's her name?

2945
03:38:36,450 --> 03:38:37,030
Not Shimiko.

2946
03:38:37,650 --> 03:38:37,970
What's her...

2947
03:38:39,110 --> 03:38:40,950
Sakuko, sorry, my brain.

2948
03:38:41,550 --> 03:38:45,110
Wait to Sakuko's family shrine, but I didn't go all the way up because I thought I'd be able to go back.

2949
03:38:46,330 --> 03:38:50,050
Yeah, I'm thinking I combined Shimizu and Sakuko together.

2950
03:38:50,350 --> 03:38:50,610
What do I say?

2951
03:38:50,730 --> 03:38:53,910
I heard this water is specifically for washing and cleansing old dirty things.

2952
03:39:01,010 --> 03:39:02,050
Strict mother's letter.

2953
03:39:02,510 --> 03:39:03,890
Good morning, my handsome boy.

2954
03:39:04,370 --> 03:39:07,170
You are different from those delinquents who run around town.

2955
03:39:07,510 --> 03:39:09,590
You have noble blood running through your veins.

2956
03:39:09,930 --> 03:39:12,030
Of course, every child must play in order to grow.

2957
03:39:12,430 --> 03:39:15,910
I simply ask that you choose wisely who you play with.

2958
03:39:17,650 --> 03:39:21,990
You must think of me as awfully overbearing, but please respect my wishes while you are still young.

2959
03:39:22,290 --> 03:39:25,070
For when you are a grown-up, you will be free to do as you please.

2960
03:39:27,930 --> 03:39:28,330
Okay.

2961
03:39:33,930 --> 03:39:35,490
Is that about Shul, maybe?

2962
03:39:36,350 --> 03:39:38,630
Do I need to bring something here to wash it?

2963
03:39:41,210 --> 03:39:43,870
The shrine is a new game plus thing.

2964
03:39:44,030 --> 03:39:45,190
Oh, okay, perfect then.

2965
03:39:46,710 --> 03:39:47,650
Alright, wait.

2966
03:39:48,110 --> 03:39:49,870
I just go down and straight.

2967
03:39:55,480 --> 03:39:56,120
Ignore.

2968
03:39:57,160 --> 03:39:57,800
Ignore.

2969
03:39:58,320 --> 03:39:58,820
Ignore.

2970
03:39:59,040 --> 03:39:59,060
Ignore.

2971
03:39:59,400 --> 03:40:00,040
Ignore.

2972
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:00,720
Ignore.

2973
03:40:01,140 --> 03:40:01,260
Ignore.

2974
03:40:01,740 --> 03:40:02,380
Ignore.

2975
03:40:02,380 --> 03:40:02,920
Ignore.

2976
03:40:03,300 --> 03:40:03,460
Ignore.

2977
03:40:03,460 --> 03:40:05,180
Ignore the footsteps behind you!

2978
03:40:09,450 --> 03:40:11,250
Down and to my left?

2979
03:40:17,200 --> 03:40:18,280
Actually, can I go this way?

2980
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:20,120
No.

2981
03:40:20,500 --> 03:40:20,720
Okay.

2982
03:40:21,300 --> 03:40:22,460
We gotta go this way?

2983
03:40:25,160 --> 03:40:26,520
What footsteps?

2984
03:40:27,220 --> 03:40:28,540
Yeah, don't...

2985
03:40:28,540 --> 03:40:30,520
worry about it.

2986
03:40:37,640 --> 03:40:38,380
Yeah!

2987
03:40:39,680 --> 03:40:41,120
Oh yeah!

2988
03:40:42,100 --> 03:40:45,820
I can still hear it, it's creeping.

2989
03:40:47,260 --> 03:40:47,420
Ah!

2990
03:40:48,080 --> 03:40:48,580
Ah!

2991
03:40:48,860 --> 03:40:49,400
Oh my gosh!

2992
03:40:50,980 --> 03:40:52,600
Oh my god!

2993
03:40:52,780 --> 03:40:53,220
Please!

2994
03:40:58,690 --> 03:40:59,430
Oh!

2995
03:40:59,510 --> 03:41:00,670
He got me before I could!

2996
03:41:03,730 --> 03:41:05,470
Oh, no, I didn't mean to do another one!

2997
03:41:06,150 --> 03:41:07,210
Dodge, dodge, please.

2998
03:41:07,970 --> 03:41:09,730
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2999
03:41:10,310 --> 03:41:10,590
Ah!

3000
03:41:11,450 --> 03:41:12,510
I'm stuck in here!

3001
03:41:14,170 --> 03:41:15,790
This is so bad!

3002
03:41:19,580 --> 03:41:20,580
Oh my gosh.

3003
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:22,480
I can't with this guy.

3004
03:41:30,060 --> 03:41:30,920
Oh my gosh.

3005
03:41:35,320 --> 03:41:35,860
Ah!

3006
03:41:36,620 --> 03:41:37,160
Ah!

3007
03:41:41,140 --> 03:41:42,880
I thought that was the end for me.

3008
03:41:44,400 --> 03:41:45,960
I really thought that was the end.

3009
03:41:47,880 --> 03:41:48,280
Sheesh!

3010
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:51,680
I don't know where it last saved either.

3011
03:41:52,440 --> 03:41:53,600
Worst enemy is the camera.

3012
03:41:53,800 --> 03:41:54,340
It can be!

3013
03:41:54,460 --> 03:41:55,840
I could have just run, but...

3014
03:42:01,300 --> 03:42:02,400
Into the goop.

3015
03:42:06,900 --> 03:42:07,660
Good job, though.

3016
03:42:07,800 --> 03:42:08,220
Thank you.

3017
03:42:09,340 --> 03:42:10,220
It was close.

3018
03:42:10,400 --> 03:42:11,580
It was very close.

3019
03:42:15,540 --> 03:42:20,720
All right, from here we go to the right.

3020
03:42:21,520 --> 03:42:22,460
But what's over this way?

3021
03:42:23,560 --> 03:42:26,680
My curiosity is...

3022
03:42:26,680 --> 03:42:29,820
Oh, okay, this way is where it's blocked off.

3023
03:42:30,900 --> 03:42:31,860
I don't see anything?

3024
03:42:32,880 --> 03:42:33,120
Okay.

3025
03:42:37,630 --> 03:42:38,930
We're back in town!

3026
03:42:40,710 --> 03:42:41,090
Ish?

3027
03:42:43,830 --> 03:42:44,610
Okay.

3028
03:42:46,030 --> 03:42:48,910
All we have to do is go all the way up the map.

3029
03:42:52,930 --> 03:42:53,310
Back home.

3030
03:42:54,230 --> 03:42:57,430
I like how these hydrangea have made it through the...

3031
03:43:02,410 --> 03:43:02,830
Yeah.

3032
03:43:10,480 --> 03:43:14,920
There's like only this area that is still shrouded in mystery.

3033
03:43:16,060 --> 03:43:17,120
I guess a little...

3034
03:43:17,120 --> 03:43:18,340
Oh, actually no, maybe not.

3035
03:43:19,360 --> 03:43:21,500
We've like walked so...

3036
03:43:21,500 --> 03:43:22,720
Look at all of this.

3037
03:43:23,020 --> 03:43:24,600
Look at this map that we've covered.

3038
03:43:24,740 --> 03:43:25,560
This area, too.

3039
03:43:27,100 --> 03:43:29,420
I like how there's tadpoles, question mark.

3040
03:43:31,200 --> 03:43:31,420
Okay.

3041
03:43:32,560 --> 03:43:35,600
We've walked, like, so much of this place, though.

3042
03:43:36,060 --> 03:43:36,580
Crazy.

3043
03:43:46,290 --> 03:43:47,910
Oh, it's nasty.

3044
03:43:50,850 --> 03:43:51,190
Okay.

3045
03:43:51,510 --> 03:43:54,770
Of course, we can't go the direction that would be easiest for us.

3046
03:43:55,310 --> 03:43:56,150
Of course not.

3047
03:43:56,230 --> 03:43:56,710
What's my health?

3048
03:43:57,050 --> 03:43:57,050
Okay.

3049
03:43:57,790 --> 03:43:58,570
Could be worse.

3050
03:44:04,580 --> 03:44:06,080
Taking it slow and steady.

3051
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:11,940
Okay, yeah.

3052
03:44:13,080 --> 03:44:15,220
Sorry that I'm constantly checking the map.

3053
03:44:16,180 --> 03:44:18,660
I do get a little lost easily sometimes.

3054
03:44:20,560 --> 03:44:20,920
Bandage.

3055
03:44:21,280 --> 03:44:21,500
Uh-oh.

3056
03:44:21,740 --> 03:44:22,620
Who are we about to fight?

3057
03:44:22,680 --> 03:44:24,400
They just gave us pills and a bandage!

3058
03:44:24,920 --> 03:44:26,620
The game is not so kind!

3059
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:31,020
Shinako needs to invest in a car.

3060
03:44:32,620 --> 03:44:34,840
She's in middle school.

3061
03:44:36,300 --> 03:44:37,720
She needs to invest in a bike.

3062
03:44:38,880 --> 03:44:39,900
That's for sure.

3063
03:44:46,030 --> 03:44:47,670
We're going through the creepy playground.

3064
03:44:51,190 --> 03:44:52,630
Which looks like...

3065
03:44:52,630 --> 03:44:55,050
It's scarily untouched.

3066
03:44:55,490 --> 03:44:58,090
Which means something's going to happen in here.

3067
03:45:01,710 --> 03:45:02,810
It's pristine.

3068
03:45:02,830 --> 03:45:04,050
Why?

3069
03:45:05,490 --> 03:45:07,610
Oh, where is the save spot?

3070
03:45:07,910 --> 03:45:08,190
Please!

3071
03:45:09,730 --> 03:45:09,970
Okay.

3072
03:45:10,890 --> 03:45:12,950
We're zigzagging through town.

3073
03:45:15,910 --> 03:45:17,230
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3074
03:45:25,310 --> 03:45:27,610
What did he get attacked by?

3075
03:45:27,770 --> 03:45:28,790
A little...

3076
03:45:29,490 --> 03:45:31,170
What is he getting attacked by?

3077
03:45:31,570 --> 03:45:32,790
A little...

3078
03:45:33,850 --> 03:45:35,430
What is that?

3079
03:45:35,510 --> 03:45:35,890
A cat?

3080
03:45:36,790 --> 03:45:38,270
A fox.

3081
03:45:39,230 --> 03:45:40,630
It's gonna get rabies.

3082
03:45:58,470 --> 03:46:01,230
That's why.

3083
03:46:03,910 --> 03:46:04,790
I...

3084
03:46:07,290 --> 03:46:07,810
Oh.

3085
03:46:09,710 --> 03:46:11,050
It's 5 p.m.

3086
03:46:14,490 --> 03:46:15,390
What's updated?

3087
03:46:17,550 --> 03:46:18,630
Oh, maybe Inari-sama?

3088
03:46:19,370 --> 03:46:20,130
Oh, the park.

3089
03:46:20,590 --> 03:46:20,870
Oh, wait.

3090
03:46:20,970 --> 03:46:22,070
There's a couple of new entries.

3091
03:46:23,070 --> 03:46:26,370
Episugaoka is mostly composed of Inari-sama believers.

3092
03:46:27,650 --> 03:46:29,650
There are statues of Inari-sama all over town.

3093
03:46:29,870 --> 03:46:33,450
My elderly neighbors treat them with great respect and worship them.

3094
03:46:33,890 --> 03:46:41,070
Inari-sama, also referred to as O Inari-sama, is a goddess that puts old, unusable tools to rest.

3095
03:46:41,750 --> 03:46:46,230
They are known for their offerings, preference of aburaage tofu pierced.

3096
03:46:47,070 --> 03:46:50,090
Wait, aburaage tofu pierced through with an old needle.

3097
03:46:51,110 --> 03:46:53,870
It seems like other towns don't have these customs, though.

3098
03:46:54,170 --> 03:46:58,810
I'm guessing they might be something special we only do for Inaresama here in Ebisugaoka.

3099
03:46:59,830 --> 03:47:01,430
Oh, she graduated middle school.

3100
03:47:01,730 --> 03:47:02,250
Oh, okay.

3101
03:47:04,330 --> 03:47:05,250
My doll!

3102
03:47:05,570 --> 03:47:06,170
I knew it.

3103
03:47:06,790 --> 03:47:09,270
exactly like the one I thought I had gotten rid of that day.

3104
03:47:10,090 --> 03:47:12,510
I'm sure it hates me for throwing it away and abandoning it.

3105
03:47:12,830 --> 03:47:15,930
When all of this is over, I'll ask my mom for a way to put it to rest.

3106
03:47:16,450 --> 03:47:16,590
Aww.

3107
03:47:19,230 --> 03:47:25,370
I heard once that there was a shrine in shambles near Shu's house, but I never knew it was here.

3108
03:47:25,810 --> 03:47:30,010
Shu told me back then that there's treasure at the roots of the divine tree or something.

3109
03:47:30,550 --> 03:47:34,390
Sakako once told me that this place is where real Sennen-Sugi shrine is.

3110
03:47:34,890 --> 03:48:33,390
Wait, so in New Game Plus, stuff at the tree i think this park i used to play at a lot when i was little i feel like all my memories of fun times and hard places took hard wait fun times and hard times my my hard places fun times and hard times took place here you can if you do a puzzle oh cool playing house with girls and playing dodgeball with boys but kids will tell you that it's weird for girls to play with boys they told me they wouldn't let me play because i hung out with the boys i remember that moment of rejection and denial crystal clear in my head why do showa kids try so hard to keep boys and girls so clearly separated feels like such an awful thing to be a part of oh is it truly such an awful thing to be part of both groups i was a tomboy and i do remember um girls not caring

3111
03:48:38,330 --> 03:48:41,170
Yeah, they really didn't care so much.

3112
03:48:45,820 --> 03:48:46,960
What's this?

3113
03:48:52,020 --> 03:48:55,660
The lights flickering are just creeping me out.

3114
03:49:01,390 --> 03:49:03,390
I should have grown a Yeti arm, I wish.

3115
03:49:14,060 --> 03:49:17,060
I think I heard something else too, so...

3116
03:49:21,160 --> 03:49:22,560
What is a tomboy?

3117
03:49:22,900 --> 03:49:24,200
I think I'm pretty girly now.

3118
03:49:25,880 --> 03:49:26,100
Maybe.

3119
03:49:29,160 --> 03:49:31,360
I think I hear something like growling over there.

3120
03:49:31,460 --> 03:49:32,200
Oh, oh yes.

3121
03:49:32,540 --> 03:49:33,220
100% I do.

3122
03:49:35,820 --> 03:49:36,800
Okay, it's one of those.

3123
03:49:36,920 --> 03:49:38,760
So I might be able to run past.

3124
03:49:38,960 --> 03:49:40,220
Sorry, I'm just getting my bearings.

3125
03:49:40,820 --> 03:49:44,580
If I run and then go to the right.

3126
03:49:46,400 --> 03:49:47,560
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3127
03:49:50,840 --> 03:49:52,180
You're not sneaking up.

3128
03:49:52,200 --> 03:49:52,720
Come on me!

3129
03:49:53,460 --> 03:49:55,200
I won't let you!

3130
03:49:58,720 --> 03:50:00,120
Took care of her?

3131
03:50:00,660 --> 03:50:01,380
Real fast?

3132
03:50:05,080 --> 03:50:07,380
I said no ma'am?

3133
03:50:10,040 --> 03:50:12,240
But I'm going to use a toolkit.

3134
03:50:15,380 --> 03:50:15,780
Nice.

3135
03:50:16,540 --> 03:50:18,200
And I'm gonna...

3136
03:50:21,450 --> 03:50:22,850
Just a little snack.

3137
03:50:23,610 --> 03:50:23,990
Alright.

3138
03:50:26,250 --> 03:50:31,770
I do wonder if there's anything over there, but I don't really feel like...

3139
03:50:31,770 --> 03:50:32,190
Oh no!

3140
03:50:33,370 --> 03:50:33,970
Squishy!

3141
03:50:36,150 --> 03:50:36,750
No!

3142
03:50:37,730 --> 03:50:41,990
If I could find a save point, so I could offer this...

3143
03:50:45,250 --> 03:50:46,610
Like, where could one be?

3144
03:50:47,970 --> 03:50:49,230
What's in here?

3145
03:50:51,050 --> 03:50:52,670
Where's your motivation?

3146
03:50:53,950 --> 03:50:54,990
Oh, is this just a house?

3147
03:50:55,110 --> 03:50:55,250
Wait.

3148
03:50:56,090 --> 03:50:57,050
What is this?

3149
03:50:57,830 --> 03:50:58,670
Strict mother's letter.

3150
03:50:59,190 --> 03:51:00,750
Good morning, my handsome boy.

3151
03:51:02,270 --> 03:51:05,090
I know it's a little sudden, but we shall be moving tomorrow.

3152
03:51:06,490 --> 03:51:07,810
I've already notified your teacher.

3153
03:51:08,250 --> 03:51:09,910
So just make sure to say goodbye to all your friends.

3154
03:51:10,290 --> 03:51:11,790
I shall tell you everything at home.

3155
03:51:20,050 --> 03:51:22,390
That looks like a box I should be able to open, no?

3156
03:51:23,990 --> 03:51:24,570
Oh, wait.

3157
03:51:31,120 --> 03:51:31,920
That's fine.

3158
03:51:40,190 --> 03:51:40,710
Oops.

3159
03:51:41,670 --> 03:51:43,710
Oh, well, I killed it, so it's okay.

3160
03:51:45,710 --> 03:51:47,030
I smushed it.

3161
03:51:47,090 --> 03:51:47,430
Wait!

3162
03:51:57,570 --> 03:52:03,050
My handsome boy!

3163
03:52:03,790 --> 03:52:08,150
Even if you find yourself poor of pockets, you must never let yourself become poor of heart.

3164
03:52:09,790 --> 03:52:41,010
inherited your father's noble blood you must study hard and learn to be a gentleman do not think of yourself as a little boy for you are simply a tiny adult waiting to grow why is she sending her kid these letters there will come a day when your father shall require help require your help mark my words that's so funny it's kind of sweet though at the same time Yes,

3165
03:52:41,290 --> 03:52:42,130
ma'am.

3166
03:52:44,650 --> 03:52:45,370
Ina Rizushi.

3167
03:52:50,300 --> 03:52:51,760
Hope everything's going good.

3168
03:52:52,920 --> 03:52:57,800
What I want to do is check over here.

3169
03:53:00,900 --> 03:53:01,820
Thank you.

3170
03:53:02,520 --> 03:53:04,640
Grab some things that I couldn't grab before.

3171
03:53:05,500 --> 03:53:07,060
And then I might call it.

3172
03:53:09,320 --> 03:53:10,160
I went...

3173
03:53:10,160 --> 03:53:11,240
I went...

3174
03:53:11,260 --> 03:53:42,840
I've been wanting the winter to come because my room gets so hot with like how my PC is so I've just been it's been like I don't know recently it's been harder for me to deal with it so I'm just like please winter I'm ready for you oh my gosh wait I believe Kiara raided me,

3175
03:53:42,980 --> 03:53:45,960
and right now I'm wearing a Kiara t-shirt.

3176
03:53:50,240 --> 03:53:52,200
Wow, how lucky.

3177
03:53:53,260 --> 03:53:54,320
It's like it was fate.

3178
03:53:54,580 --> 03:53:55,280
I just remember.

3179
03:53:55,380 --> 03:53:56,900
I looked down and saw orange.

3180
03:53:57,200 --> 03:53:58,320
I was like, wait a second.

3181
03:53:59,500 --> 03:54:01,240
I'm wearing a Kiara t-shirt.

3182
03:54:03,160 --> 03:54:04,800
It was meant to be.

3183
03:54:05,900 --> 03:54:07,140
It was, it was.

3184
03:54:08,240 --> 03:54:10,080
Oh my gosh, look at my playtime.

3185
03:54:11,260 --> 03:54:12,860
hours almost on the dot.

3186
03:54:13,160 --> 03:54:13,900
That's crazy.

3187
03:54:17,460 --> 03:54:17,780
Yeah.

3188
03:54:18,720 --> 03:54:20,460
I was wearing orange.

3189
03:54:20,780 --> 03:54:22,340
You glad you chose that shirt today.

3190
03:54:23,440 --> 03:54:23,620
I know.

3191
03:54:23,820 --> 03:54:24,680
She rated me.

3192
03:54:26,700 --> 03:54:27,080
Yeah.

3193
03:54:27,320 --> 03:54:27,640
I'm wearing it.

3194
03:54:27,640 --> 03:54:29,200
I'm wearing it's the Omocat.

3195
03:54:30,320 --> 03:54:31,900
Collab t-shirt.

3196
03:54:32,740 --> 03:54:33,360
So cute.

3197
03:54:40,280 --> 03:55:03,700
part of me wants to continue but part of me is like hungry i am still enjoying it don't get me wrong especially we became like kind of overpowered at a second i feel like i've gotten a little bit better at the game which makes me less hesitant of playing as well how hungry go eat girl yeah i'm gonna eat you have one big dungeon left it's over.

3198
03:55:04,320 --> 03:55:04,320
Really?

3199
03:55:04,920 --> 03:55:07,660
Oh, so maybe next time we could beat the game?

3200
03:55:14,100 --> 03:55:14,940
What will you eat?

3201
03:55:15,200 --> 03:55:17,000
I got pizza waiting for me.

3202
03:55:18,860 --> 03:55:20,680
Yeah, I feel like I've gotten better.

3203
03:55:20,840 --> 03:55:22,560
I think it's because I have less fear.

3204
03:55:25,180 --> 03:55:26,040
Sounds so funny.

3205
03:55:26,340 --> 03:55:27,240
I'm fearless.

3206
03:55:27,760 --> 03:55:32,120
No, it's because I think I've grown more accustomed to like their attack types and everything.

3207
03:55:34,220 --> 03:55:36,460
But I'm getting hungry.

3208

3245
03:58:45,840 --> 03:59:06,360
Um, yeah, tomorrow is a sloppy sister collab, and the game that I wanted us to play, um, is up to five players, so I was like, and Nimi has asked before, she was like, if you ever need an extra person, for a game when you guys are playing and stuff, um,

3246
03:59:06,940 --> 03:59:11,500
feel free to invite me, and so I was just like, well, it's up to five players, so I was like, I'll invite Nimi.

3247
03:59:12,860 --> 03:59:41,380
but the dev of the game and the game is supposed to come out tomorrow but the dev of the game said that it might be delayed so we might have to change games but we'll figure something out apparently there was like something with his with the build that like had to get delayed or something but we're still trying to find a game where all five of us can play So,

3248
03:59:41,800 --> 03:59:44,840
because obviously I would feel so bad if I was like, hey, Nimmy, you want to play with us?

3249
03:59:45,300 --> 03:59:50,820
And then I was like, oh, sorry, Nimmy, we found the game is a big, big delay.

3250
03:59:51,060 --> 03:59:53,800
And so we, you know, be so sad.

3251
03:59:54,780 --> 03:59:55,720

3252
03:59:58,180 --> 03:59:58,540

So Sloppy Sisters with a side of Nimmy for eyes.

3254
04:00:04,180 --> 04:00:06,640
So we're going to find something else.

3255
04:00:07,220 --> 04:00:10,160
If the game is not out, we'll see.

We have ideas for other games.

3259
04:00:14,800 --> 04:00:16,780
It's just a matter of choosing something.

3260
04:00:18,000 --> 04:00:21,220
But yeah, so the game might be different.

3261
04:00:26,760 --> 04:00:29,760
