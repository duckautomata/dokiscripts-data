1
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,350
Hold on.

2
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,230
Hold on.

3
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,670
Wait.

4
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,680
OK.

5
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,700
Hello!

6
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,700
Hello, hello, hello.

7
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,040
Hello, hello, hello.

8
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,960
Hello, hello, hello.

9
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,120
Hello, hello, hello.

10
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,780
I'm back.

11
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,480
Hi!

12
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,720
Oh, thank you for the bargain deal!

13
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

14
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,160
Thank you!

15
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,800
Welcome back to Lifeline.

16
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,280
I was going to say something and I don't remember what.

17
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,480
Ash, look at the membership!

18
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,760
It means it was my birthday today!

19
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,920
Happy birthday!

20
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,760
Happy birthday to you.

21
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,240
Happy birthday to you.

22
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,960
Happy birthday, dear Rin.

23
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,800
Happy birthday to you.

24
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,660
Happy birthday!

25
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,820
Rio, welcome to membership!

26
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,880
Okidoki!

27
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,540
I'll be honest.

28
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,760
I don't quite remember how to play this game.

29
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,240
I think I remember, but...

30
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,960
Tomorrow is my birthday.

31
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,900
MGS2 was my first ever in the series.

32
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,420
I beat it a dozen times trying to understand it before finding MGS1.

33
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,450
Happy birthday!

34
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,070
Happy birthday to you.

35
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,910
Happy birthday to you.

36
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,510
Happy birthday, MercyKilled.

37
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,750
Happy birthday to you.

38
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,250
Happy birthday!

39
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,830
Sorry that I had to push this day.

40
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,990
If you're watching the VOD, then...

41
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,970
That already happened.

42
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,810
It might not matter so much to you.

43
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,730
But because of that, today might not be such a long stream.

44
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,530
Since I'm playing later from when I was initially going to play.

45
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,970
Hello, VODWaters.

46
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,070
VODWaters?

47
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,670
VODWatchers!

48
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,570
Everybody say hello to the VODWatchers!

49
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,570
Hold on, let me try and remember...

50
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,000
OK, I clearly don't remember how to play this.

51
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,020
I forget that square is confirmed in this game.

52
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,060
Oh my gosh, OK.

53
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,140
OK, hold on.

54
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,340
Is he actually watching me?

55
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,940
Yes, please, Rio!

56
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,720
Hold on!

57
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,360
Hold on, Rio.

58
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,380
OK.

59
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,720
It's my birthday in 10 months.

60
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,120
We'll see you in 10 months!

61
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,140
Oh yeah, let her sit down, you know.

62
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,100
Annunciate, I'm annunciating!

63
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm annunciating.

64
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,960
OK, this is our items.

65
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,620
R1 is items.

66
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,720
I'm trying to figure out what the...

67
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,720
If there's like a...

68
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,100
What's the word?

69
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,140
A...

70
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,420
A...

71
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,620
Oh gosh.

72
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,760
You know.

73
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,980
A controller...

74
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,760
Guide.

75
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,160
Tells me this button does this.

76
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,820
And there goes X-Ray the Thundercrafter!

77
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,340
Rio is crashing out.

78
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm crashing out!

79
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,520
OK.

80
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
And then I also, I think it's...

81
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,000
Huh?

82
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:17,980
Hello!

83
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,260
Hello.

84
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,120
Huh?

85
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,060
Hello.

86
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:24,820
Huh?

87
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,140
Look at me.

88
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,340
The bed, OK?

89
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,700
No!

90
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:28,940
Huh?

91
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,160
Rio, we just started!

92
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:38,860
What?

93
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,300
There's not even a bed in here!

94
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,260
We're in the infirmary!

95
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,900
OK, let me do a quick recap.

96
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,740
Sorry, my brain's a little scattered today.

97
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,700
I had quite a bit going on.

98
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,780
Quiet.

99
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,740
Quiet.

100
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Be quiet.

101
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,460
Stop!

102
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh my god!

103
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,960
She wants me so bad.

104
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,040
What?

105
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,540
So, we are...

106
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,940
We are a dude guide.

107
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,740
Is he actually watching me?

108
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,020
She's talking about us, right?

109
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,380
And basically, a recap of the game from last time is...

110
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,140
We were on this fancy space station.

111
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,640
And suddenly...

112
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Aliens attacked!

113
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,880
And...

114
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,180
We got separated from our girlfriend, Naomi.

115
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,740
And we woke up.

116
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,380
We were in the security room.

117
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,060
And we're watching...

118
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,380
Aren't there any instructions?

119
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,800
We're watching this lovely lady, Rio.

120
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,420
And we're giving her...

121
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,660
We're giving her instructions.

122
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,380
Directions on what to do and things of the such.

123
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,300
I heard there might be another MGS collab again in Fortnite.

124
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,900
Oh yeah, I saw that too!

125
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,120
I did see that.

126
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,620
Please, Ocelot, the boss, Gray Fox.

127
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,020
I think they'll probably put in Naked Snake, but...

128
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,540
I wonder if people will complain.

129
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,340
Because Naked Snake and Solid Snake...

130
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,500
Is he actually watching me?

131
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,140
Kinda look similar, you know?

132
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,660
So...

133
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,940
Yeah, I'm watching you!

134
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm watching you.

135
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,800
Yes.

136
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,760
What?

137
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,360
Stop.

138
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,020
Yes.

139
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,440
What do you mean, yes?

140
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:36,960
To where?

141
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
I think we're just about to...

142
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,060
Do a boss fight, so I'm a little nervous.

143
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,840
Not even 10 minutes in and it's an amazing start.

144
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,440
Take a drink when she says the bed?

145
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,420
Oh no, no!

146
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,220
You mean a drink of water.

147
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,320
You mean a drink of water.

148
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,160
Do a sexy pose.

149
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
The crack!

150
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,140
Holy moly!

151
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,040
Rio!

152
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,340
Do a sexy pose.

153
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Peach!

154
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,940
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches...

155
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,840
Oh my god!

156
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,220
I don't think I can...

157
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,140
I don't think I can...

158
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,380
I can't zoom when she does that.

159
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,060
See, watch.

160
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,720
Zoom.

161
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
Oh wait, hold on.

162
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,300
There's like a special mode I have to go into.

163
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,100
What's it called?

164
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,760
Oh, in consultation, that's right.

165
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,300
Consultation.

166
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,940
Where am I?

167
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,700
How's the...

168
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
How's the audio by the way?

169
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,000
Testing your own patience today?

170
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,620
Thanks for all the peaches.

171
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,160
Is the drink of water game the VOD water?

172
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:20,960
What?

173
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,640
Good audio?

174
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,340
Okay, thank you.

175
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,780
What else was there?

176
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,480
What should we do?

177
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,460
Oh yeah!

178
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:32,500
Yeah.

179
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,060
That's right.

180
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,560
I said we were about to go do a boss.

181
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,520
We're about to fight this spider monster.

182
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,660
And we're trying to blow it up?

183
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,620
Fire.

184
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,740
Okay, well...

185
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,220
I'll just say, leave.

186
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,800
Oh, stop.

187
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,940
Okay, that's it for consultation.

188
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,340
Then we're going to go...

189
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,720
RID OF SPIDERS!

190
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,520
Leave.

191
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,360
Leave room.

192
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,820
Yes, see?

193
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
There she goes.

194
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,580
Alright.

195
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,280
I don't know why she doesn't understand leave, but she understands leave room.

196
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,280
Alright, let's go defeat the spider monster.

197
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm fully prepared to defeat that spider.

198
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,040
It's on the other side of Shutter 4.

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,840
How to become a member on my mobile?

200
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,320
Oh, I think there's like...

201
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,240
Some...

202
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,700
If it's like...

203
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,780
Apple phone?

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,980
Isn't it like weird to become a member?

205
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,400
I don't remember exactly.

206
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,720
But thanks for trying, Jeremy.

207
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,740
Okay, so it is at Shutter 4.

208
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,220
No, 3.

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,520
3?

210
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,500
Shutter 3.

211
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,100
Go to Shutter 3.

212
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,580
Shutter 3.

213
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,340
Okay.

214
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,830
Run.

215
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:02,670
Yes.

216
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,010
I love telling her to run.

217
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:09,750
Okay.

218
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,270
Thanks for the hint.

219
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,230
You guys are cute.

220
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,830
Oh no, I'm scared.

221
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,030
What am I...

222
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,750
The shutter is open.

223
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,430
What should I do?

224
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,310
Is it Shutter 4?

225
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,110
Oh, maybe it's Shutter 4.

226
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,270
Go to Shutter 4.

227
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,670
Shutter 4.

228
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,190
Okay.

229
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,530
Oopsie.

230
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,490
Run.

231
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,330
Yes.

232
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,030
Yes.

233
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,170
Yes, sir.

234
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,890
No, sir.

235
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,870
Anyways, how are you guys doing today?

236
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,390
How are you guys doing?

237
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,470
Okay, I'm going to do my best.

238
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,170
I'm scared.

239
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:57,810
Great.

240
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,390
Good.

241
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:58,870
Good.

242
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,310
Do or die.

243
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,270
Oh my God.

244
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:09,730
Look at her.

245
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,230
Look at me.

246
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,890
Yes, I'm ready.

247
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,250
She's so... Look at her.

248
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,830
Look at me.

249
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,230
Oh my God.

250
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,970
Oh my God.

251
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,590
Oh my God.

252
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,670
Wait, I think we should open the door first.

253
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,970
Or maybe actually...

254
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:28,810
Yes.

255
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,250
Okay.

256
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,210
Oh my God.

257
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,670
Oh God.

258
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,230
Use your eyes, Rio.

259
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,570
If I wave this around, the spider won't be too eager to get close.

260
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,790
There's only one Molotov cocktail.

261
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,610
If we blow it, I'm as good as dead.

262
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,030
Okay.

263
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,570
Okay, it's time to waste that spider.

264
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,330
Open the shutter.

265
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,110
Oh my God.

266
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,150
Oh Rio.

267
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,770
Oh Rio.

268
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,090
Oh my God.

269
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,310
No pressure, right?

270
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,110
Oh my God.

271
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,370
Here it comes.

272
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,750
Here it is.

273
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,870
Okay.

274
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,550
The pressure.

275
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,140
Okay.

276
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,280
What?

277
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm watching.

278
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,780
Does that count?

279
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,240
Throw!

280
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,500
I missed.

281
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,640
Oh my gosh.

282
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
But it's mouth was open.

283
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
Is it this difficult?

284
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:31,960
Oh my gosh.

285
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:32,800
Up.

286
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,520
Get up.

287
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,600
Leave room.

288
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,180
Okay.

289
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,120
I'll leave.

290
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,800
The mouth was open, right?

291
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,220
Voice QTE.

292
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,620
How long do I have to wait for it to be open for?

293
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,960
How...

294
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,300
Run...oh.

295
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,440
Yes.

296
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,580
Rio?

297
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,140
Rio?

298
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:02,740
Rio?

299
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,740
Run to shutter 4.

300
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,860
No!

301
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,920
Stop.

302
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,420
Stop.

303
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:08,960
Stop.

304
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,820
Go to shutter 4.

305
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,320
Run.

306
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,380
You said it when it went back up, I think.

307
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,280
Oh my goodness.

308
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,560
So I have to be like super duper fast.

309
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,380
Is this really that hard of a boss fight?

310
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,690
Oh geez.

311
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,370
Okay.

312
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:01,850
Okay.

313
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,650
Time the time cycle.

314
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,050
I like the music though.

315
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,150
No!

316
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,730
Oh no wait!

317
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,110
I'm ready.

318
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,070
She's like I get it though.

319
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,550
I get it.

320
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,950
I wish I could skip this cutscene.

321
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,510
No you can't skip.

322
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:39,830
Okay.

323
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,210
I like the way she looks at me here though.

324
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,490
Yeah you are girl!

325
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,150
Okay.

326
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,850
You could use your own eyes.

327
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,350
The spider won't be too eager to get close.

328
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,510
There's only one molotov cocktail.

329
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,370
If we blow it, I'm as good as dead.

330
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,330
Okay, it's time to waste that spider.

331
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,090
Open the shutter.

332
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:22,830
Okay!

333
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,830
I kind of am obsessed with the death sequence though.

334
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,290
It's so funny.

335
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,870
Oh no!

336
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,930
I missed!

337
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,930
Can he hurt her?

338
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,790
Like can the monster hurt her?

339
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,870
Or is it just I keep timing him?

340
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,890
Oh no!

341
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,010
I missed!

342
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,570
It's afraid of the fire.

343
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,950
Just keep shooting it maybe.

344
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,690
Oh it had it's mouth open.

345
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:57,910
Okay.

346
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,150
Okay!

347
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,430
Okay so once it's on the ground, I...

348
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,510
What?

349
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,970
Oh!

350
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,290
First

351
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
try baby!

352
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,270
Let's go hurry up.

353
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,410
She's got good aim.

354
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,150
Yes!

355
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,330
Thank you.

356
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,410
Kudos to you!

357
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,230
Yeah, you tell him!

358
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:10,610
Oh!

359
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,990
Yeah, you tell him.

360
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,690
What?

361
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,850
Who are you?

362
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,510
This guy sounds like an alien trying to sound like a human.

363
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,470
What?

364
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,710
What do you mean you are partly to blame?

365
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,630
UFO!

366
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,270
I had opposed the opening of this hotel, but JSL refused to heed my warnings.

367
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,970
In preparation for possible disaster, I kept a rescue team on standby.

368
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,970
They are on their way here now.

369
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,290
You should make your way to the receiving port.

370
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,930
I will catch up after I find Alan.

371
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,870
I found your assistant unconscious in his room.

372
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,450
Dude was standing there the other time.

373
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,110
What is this?

374
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,790
Is Alan safe?

375
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,810
I wouldn't know.

376
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,690
There's even a good chance he's dead.

377
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,790
You need to hurry.

378
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,870
I thought you needed to get through here.

379
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,670
Don't go the opposite way.

380
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,810
Rio!

381
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:33,930
Oh my God!

382
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,130
Rio!

383
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,000
A major wobble was detected in the safe station's rotation.

384
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,980
The station was placed on emergency status.

385
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,280
Although the wobble will not interfere with its orbit.

386
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,820
The gap section, however, had to be completely sealed off.

387
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,880
This completely blocks the way again.

388
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,140
But good thing this section wasn't sealed off.

389
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,200
One major wobble!

390
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,000
Not much else we can do besides obtaining a shutter key.

391
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,040
I'm Major Wobble.

392
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,220
What a cute name.

393
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,280
Oh, we're going to the restroom.

394
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,040
Restroom.

395
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,920
She's got such an attitude.

396
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,420
Jessie!

397
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
Thanks for the five gifted!

398
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,980
Major Wobble.

399
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,880
Look out for Major Wobbles.

400
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,380
Yes, I want that to be my general.

401
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,620
Major... not general.

402
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,420
You know, in the army, I would love to be called Major Wobbles.

403
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,080
Go to restroom.

404
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,320
Run.

405
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,860
Oh gosh, I know I'm going to be fighting stuff in there.

406
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,480
I know I'm going to be attacked, ambushed.

407
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,060
Oh gosh.

408
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,280
I need to remember how to fight.

409
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,800
Shoot number two.

410
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,040
Oh my gosh, wait, this is the perfect place to shoot!

411
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,100
You seem to be out in the back.

412
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,340
Listen, do you know the story?

413
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,160
What?

414
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,560
That if you die in space, your soul wanders through space forever?

415
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,780
Who said that?

416
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,120
The restroom in the guest section?

417
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,920
Well, there are these spooky rumors.

418
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,480
At night, even though there's supposed to be no one around, you can hear the sound of a music box.

419
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:45,080
When they were building the outer wall of the station, there was an accident involving some workers, and three were lost.

420
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:53,880
Two were miraculously rescued, but the last worker was never recovered.

421
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:03,500
That worker, he's said to have worn a pendant with a family photo and a music box.

422
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,360
Listen, operator.

423
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
How good are you with stories like this?

424
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,640
I'm a ghost.

425
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,160
What I mean is, do you get scared by ghost stories?

426
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:17,940
Yes.

427
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,560
Oh.

428
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,100
I don't believe in stories like that either.

429
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,800
I guess we're alike that way.

430
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,980
General Jiggle.

431
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,160
What was that sound?

432
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,940
Ryo, I'm scared.

433
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,200
Ryo, hold me.

434
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,200
Ryo, I'm scared.

435
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,960
Ryo, when did this turn into a horror game?

436
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,600
I must have imagined it.

437
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,260
I didn't imagine it.

438
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,800
Ryo, who was falling?

439
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,940
Oh my gosh.

440
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,760
What do you mean?

441
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,360
Go.

442
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,500
Go further.

443
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,320
Yes.

444
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,280
Yes.

445
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm probably leading her to her death, but...

446
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,000
Oh my gosh.

447
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,860
I'm scared.

448
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm scared.

449
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,320
General Jiggle.

450
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,420
I'm scared.

451
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,480
Is it a real ghost?

452
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,700
Check door number one.

453
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,060
Yes where?

454
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,700
Where are you going?

455
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,620
I'm scared.

456
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,340
Guess what?

457
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,240
What?

458
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,440
Where is she going?

459
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:14,880
Ryo?

460
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:15,740
Okay.

461
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,800
Turn around?

462
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,670
I said look behind you.

463
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,310
Go to bathroom.

464
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,710
It was so easy.

465
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,390
How do I get her to go in there?

466
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,190
Is that a save station?

467
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,990
Actually, that's a good question.

468
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,590
Go to save point.

469
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,630
Yeah, thank you.

470
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,310
Actually, you kind of saved me.

471
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,230
You actually kind of saved me.

472
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:54,750
Thank you.

473
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,010
Who said that?

474
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,470
Marads, thank you.

475
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,450
Restrooms.

476
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,190
Okay.

477
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,070
Got nice.

478
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,070
Yeah, we would have to do the boss fight again.

479
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,410
This game isn't...

480
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,250
Okay, now let's see.

481
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,170
What's the map?

482
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,510
The guy, unless he's a pervert, he would be in the men's stalls, right?

483
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,470
She said it was a guy that died.

484
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,890
But we heard the music box come from the ladies' stalls.

485
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,710
Go to ladies' stalls.

486
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,970
I'm scared.

487
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,810
You're scaring me.

488
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,010
How do I tell her to go in?

489
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,350
Oh, there we go.

490
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,410
How do I...

491
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,830
Where did the hints go?

492
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,310
Where did the hints go?

493
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,350
Stall 1.

494
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,530
Knock, knock.

495
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:15,750
Rex!

496
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,910
It's my birthday!

497
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,050
Of course!

498
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,050
Happy birthday.

499
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,030
Congratulations.

500
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,010
Happy birthday with salutations.

501
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,130
Happy birthday.

502
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,630
May your sky stay blue.

503
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,830
Happy birthday to you.

504
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,150
Happy birthday, Rex!

505
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,610
What's the last one though?

506
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,330
What's that last door?

507
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,410
Go to door.

508
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,190
Door.

509
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,810
Go to door.

510
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,610
Door, door.

511
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,230
Door.

512
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,070
Door.

513
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,190
Go to door.

514
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,410
Door.

515
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,710
Closet.

516
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,630
Okay, the closet.

517
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,630
Open the door.

518
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,270
Open the door.

519
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,830
It's locked.

520
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,190
It appears to be a number lock type.

521
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,570
Number lock type.

522
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,630
Can you open it operator?

523
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:29,790
On.

524
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,980
8.

525
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,140
008

526
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,940
Go to wash stands.

527
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,140
Why there is a wash stand?

528
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,200
Why not a sink?

529
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,060
Oh, shiny.

530
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,200
Check mirror.

531
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,020
The mirror.

532
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,460
The mirror.

533
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,960
Check left mirror.

534
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,680
She was the one who was telling the ghost.

535
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
She psyched herself out.

536
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,460
Check middle mirror.

537
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,500
Check right mirror.

538
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,960
Oh yeah.

539
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,320
Bloody Mary.

540
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,200
Search.

541
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,440
What exactly?

542
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,260
Trash.

543
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,040
Are you maybe talking about that?

544
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,440
Oh yeah, we could shoot the mirror, right?

545
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,340
Search trash can.

546
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,120
It's an ordinary trash can.

547
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,300
No, there is something in there.

548
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,040
I know it.

549
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,060
Oh my gosh.

550
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,240
Search behind trash can.

551
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,120
It's an ordinary trash can.

552
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,820
There is probably...

553
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Shoot mirror.

554
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,400
Shoot mirror.

555
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,080
Check inside trash can.

556
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,880
No, there is not, madam.

557
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,460
Auto fire?

558
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,380
That sounds huge actually.

559
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,400
Ok, awesome.

560
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,720
What was this?

561
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,740
It was a stall, right?

562
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,600
Ladies stalls.

563
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,820
I don't think we checked each door, right?

564
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,400
So, what is it?

565
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,680
Check stall left.

566
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,240
Check stall middle.

567
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,080
Check middle stall.

568
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,980
What happens if you just shout boo?

569
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:03,700
Boo!

570
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,360
Bad posture.

571
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,560
No, she's all like... She's scared.

572
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,140
Check right stall.

573
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Probably.

574
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,260
Check middle stall.

575
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,700
Ok, never mind.

576
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,720
Check stall 2.

577
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,740
Ok, never mind.

578
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,260
I give up.

579
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,240
Ok, to the men's.

580
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,300
Go to men's stalls.

581
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,120
Which stall was that?

582
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,040
Go to men's stalls.

583
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,640
The men's stalls.

584
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,000
The men's stalls.

585
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,540
Is this how it feels like talking?

586
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,020
Run.

587
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,480
No, I'm scared.

588
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,200
She won't run.

589
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,580
Go to men's stalls.

590
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,580
The men's stalls.

591
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,120
She won't run because she's too scared.

592
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,880
No.

593
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,700
Is that a closet?

594
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,540
Men's stalls.

595
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,260
Oh, we are here.

596
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,980
Check right stall.

597
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,540
That's scary.

598
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,760
Where is the urinals?

599
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,220
Isn't that what a men's bathroom has?

600
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,240
Why do they get 4 stalls?

601
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,540
And we only, the girlies, get only 3 stalls.

602
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,480
Excuse me.

603
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,720
Check first stall.

604
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,400
Maybe tell her to open them.

605
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,160
Oh, I can try.

606
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,080
Open first stall.

607
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,000
Open first stall.

608
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,880
Open last stall.

609
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,860
Oh, she can open.

610
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,360
Oh my gosh, this whole time.

611
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,000
I thought check was, you know...

612
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,380
Was...

613
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,600
Pretty...

614
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,000
I thought it, you know...

615
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,720
I thought we understood the assignment.

616
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,020
Check.

617
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,420
Oh, nevermind.

618
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,520
Open second stall.

619
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,460

620
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,120

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,620
Open the second stall.

623
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,540
No!

624
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,480
Oh my God.

625
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:07,920
Stop.

626
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,520
Stop.

627
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,700
Men's stalls.

628
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Guys, there is no middle because...

629
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,320
I'll try middle left.

630
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,160
Try stall 2.

631
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,960
Open stall 2.

632
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,200
Wait, where are we?

633
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,760
This isn't stall 2.

634
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,260
Where are we?

635
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,180
This is the last stall.

636
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,460
Oh gosh.

637
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,980
This is stall 4.

638
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,100

639
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,440

660
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,840
Oh my God.

661
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,660
I needed to heal.

662
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,200
Heal!

663
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,740
Help!

664
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,520
Oh my God.

665
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,120
Oh my God!

666
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,700
She's about to die!

667
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,160
Heal!

668
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,400

669
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,040

670
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,360

671
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,960
Run!

672
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,080
Run!

673
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,280
I was recover.

674
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,860
Oh my gosh.

675
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,660
I was...

676
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,300
I forgot the word.

677
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,000
I forgot you can't use heal.

678
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,120
Rio!

679
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,460
You know, I feel like this is the one game you guys can't say skill issue to.

680
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,340
I'm not the one shooting.

681
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm not the one shooting.

682
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,900
Voice issue.

683
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,360
I think we have to go back to the women's stalls.

684
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,140
Ladies stalls.

685
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,660
It's the ladies stalls.

686
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,340
Because we have to get the ticket again.

687
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,220
I have to figure out what the auto-fire is.

688
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,280
Welcome to Mambusha.

689
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,640
Thank you.

690
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,620
Open stall 1.

691
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,010
Okay, I'll open it.

692
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,750
Open it.

693
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,150
I'm scared.

694
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,490
You have to.

695
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,710
Open stall 2.

696
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,630

00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,970
Why does she have such trouble with 2?

698
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,890
Open stall 2.

699
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,210
Open stall 2.

700
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,750
Which stall was that?

701
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,830
Open stall 2.

702
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,390
Which stall was that?

703
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:29,510

704
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:30,710

705
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:31,970

706
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,110
Hey, you know, I really am scared.

707
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,010
Don't say anything stupid, you jerk.

708
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,130
What did I say?

709
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,350
Did she think I was trying to kiss her or something?

710
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,690
Open second stall.

711
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,210

00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,030
Open stall 2.

715
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,030
You know what?

716
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,250
Fine.

717
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,930
That works.

718
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,850
What was it?

719
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,510
Search trash can.

720
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,830
What do you mean?

721
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,570
Search trash can.

722
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,070
And then inside the trash can.

723
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,690
Look inside trash can.

724
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:30,830
No, there's not.

725
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,430
You called her number 2.

726
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,630
Try number 2?

727
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,210
Okay, I'll try number 2.

728
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:39,990
Autofire.

729
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,070
Wait.

730
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,330
Mat.

731
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,650
What do I say?

732
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,070
Reload.

733
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,410
Shoot.

734
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,690
Number 1.

735
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,010
Special?

736
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,830
Oh there's a sexy pose.

737
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,170
Hold on.

738
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,150
Where?

739
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,210
It's not in there.

740
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,810
Weird.

741
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:09,910
Weird.

742
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,690
Ladies stalls.

743
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,650
Ladies stalls.

744
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,990
Oh I passed it.

745
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:21,810
It was under special.

746
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:22,950
Wait, where?

747
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,030
Special.

748
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,270
Oh!

749
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,490
In battle.

750
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,510

751
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,390
Okay, cool.

753
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,670

Oh yeah, middle stall.

Maybe, maybe.

758
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,290
I'll try it.

759
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,770
Nothing.

760
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,350
Okay.

761
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,430

00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:37,730
Stop!

771
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:38,570
Stop!

772
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:38,890
Stop!

773
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,130
Stop!

774
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,450
Stop!

775
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,010
Ladies stalls.

776
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,050
Oh my god, please.

777
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,650
Please listen to me Rio.

778
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,670
Open stall.

779
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,870
Open right stall.

780
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,290
Open middle right stall.

781
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,130
Open second stall.

782
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,770
Stop!

783
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:15,610
Stop!

784
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:16,490
Stop!

785
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,450
It should be second stall from the left.

786
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:27,930
Okay.

787
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,230
Ladies stalls.

788
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,530
I'll try again.

789
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,390
Open second stall from the left.

790
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,770
It worked!

791
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,110
Oh my gosh.

792
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,110
Oh my gosh, it worked.

793
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,750
Finally.

794
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,950
Then there was something inside!

795
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,070
It was actually worth it!

796
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,910
Oh my goodness, thank you.

797
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:57,130
There's...

798
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,370
Yeah, grab it.

799
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,870
Oh thank god, it was actually worth my time.

800
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,430
Can I tell her to recover now?

801
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:10,910
Recover health.

802
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,010
Recover.

803
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,210
I guess not.

804
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,050
Okay, how do I...

805
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,810
Open second stall from right.

806
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,110
Oh it worked!

807
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:22,990
Oh my gosh.

808
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,850
Thank goodness.

809
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,310
It's so inconsistent.

810
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,210
I know, right?

811
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,470
Please don't get ambushed.

812
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,250
Recover!

813
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,270
Recover!

814
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,490
Recover!

815
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:54,990
Okay, alright.

816
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:55,910
Shoot!

817
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,790
Auto-fire!

818
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:01,910
Run!

819
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,420
Run!

820
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,120
Auto-fire stomach!

821
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,960
Oh my god.

822
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,040
Stomach!

823
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,720
Keep shooting!

824
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,580
Keep shooting!

825
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,400
Run!

826
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,160
What do you mean where did it go?

827
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,880
I love auto-fire!

828
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,140
Yeah!

829
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,880
Save point.

830
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,260
Holy moly, where did it go?

831
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,990
Gosh.

832
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,530
You shot it to death, Rio.

833
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:42,410
What do you mean?

834
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,390
Okay.

835
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,350
Alright, we save.

836
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:52,710
We did the ladies room.

837
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,090
Have you guys ever seen a ladies room before?

838
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,250
Is that your first time?

839
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,750
Lucky you.

840
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,570
Okey dokey.

841
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,330
To the men's room.

842
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,110
Yuck.

843
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,750
Men's stalls.

844
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,050
Run.

845
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,090
No.

846
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,430
No.

847
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,310
Men's stalls.

848
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,430
I am a lady.

849
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,870
Then you know that the bathrooms are too clean here.

850
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,770
Ladies restrooms are not typically very good.

851
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,370
It was the fourth stall that we got ambushed before, right?

852
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,190
Check closet.

853
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,630
Is it also a number closet?

854
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,370
We are also getting ambushed in here.

855
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,410
Oh that sucks.

856
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:55,330
Run!

857
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,270
Nice.

858
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,150
Auto-fire!

859
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,270
What did I do?

860
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,450
Mouth!

861
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,030
Stomach!

862
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,070
Auto-fire!

863
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,130
Run!

864
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,570
Alright.

865
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:20,570
Nice, nice, nice.

866
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,710
Auto-fire!

867
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:22,390
Stomach!

868
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,570
Stomach!

869
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:29,850
Mouth!

870
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,370
Auto-fire!

871
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:34,830
Mouth!

872
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,070
Run!

873
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,750
Auto-fire!

874
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,570
Mouth!

875
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:46,830
Oh wait.

876
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:47,550
Auto-fire!

877
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:51,810
Run!

878
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:53,390
Run!

879
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,650
Run!

880
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:55,890
No.

881
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:56,810
I mean mouth.

882
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,010
Auto-fire!

883
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,410
Oh wow.

884
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,230
She did it.

885
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,830
I can't believe it.

886
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,730
It would have only taken two bullets if she actually knew how to aim.

887
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,600
Oh my god.

888
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,960
I love auto-fire.

889
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,400
I'm going to use that the whole game.

890
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,140
Okay.

891
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,760
What was it?

892
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,980
Open stall second from right.

893
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,080
Yeah.

894
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,680
Nice.

895
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,640
Okay.

896
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,440
I'll open it.

897
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,100
That is a ricochet sound.

898
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,480
Yeah!

899
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,480
I need your professional advice.

900
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,700
I'm playing a game and I'm torn.

901
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:50,260
Do I date the cute girl who spams emoticons in text or the goth girl with her freaky long alien tongue?

902
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,880
I think the alien tongue.

903
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:56,420
Right?

904
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,260
What kind of emoticons are we talking about?

905
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,780
Are you playing...

906
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,300
Needy Streamer Overload?

907
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,680
Are you playing Needy Streamer Overload?

908
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,160
Open stall second from left.

909
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,280
Was there anything in the first one?

910
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,540
I can't remember.

911
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,000
I don't think so.

912
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,820
Oh, he's got a ticket.

913
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,720
He's got a golden ticket.

914
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,940
He's got a golden ticket to the shutter.

915
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,840
A chip?

916
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,700
He's not going to come alive, is he?

917
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,780
What was it?

918
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,920
Men's wash stands.

919
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,240
Yeah, they're all dressed very dapper in this.

920
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,360
Check mirror.

921
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,660
A mirror?

922
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,140
Check middle mirror.

923
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,600
Shoot middle mirror.

924
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,600
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

925
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,520
029?

926
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,800
Oh, that's it?

927
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:32,800
029.

928
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,380
I wonder what this number is.

929
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,860
Okay, check trash can.

930
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,780
It's an ordinary trash can.

931
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,920
Even the detail...

932
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,600
This game, despite being so old, is like...

933
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,540
I mean, it's PS2.

934
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,860
There's even...

935
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,540
They have the glass shatter on the sink and everything.

936
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,780
Everything is actually like...

937
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,460
You know, kind of pretty detailed.

938
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,800
Check inside trash can.

939
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,260
Is it empty?

940
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,540
Okay.

941
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,800
Go to save point.

942
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,760
And run.

943
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,040
Run.

944
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,880
She's so...

945
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,900
She's so cautious.

946
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,040
Come on, girl.

947
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:22,980
Come on.

948
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,040
Oh, she's fine now.

949
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,040
To be fair, I think I'd be pretty scared, too.

950
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,180
Journey you.

951
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,060
Welcome to membership.

952
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:33,640
Thank you.

953
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,820
Eat the trash can.

954
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,980
I guess if you're desperate, you get lots of fiber from the paper towels, right?

955
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,060
Nice.

956
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,340
Okay.

957
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,300
Alright.

958
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,040
What was it?

959
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,740
Ladies' closet.

960
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,080
029 Ladies' stalls.

961
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,160
Go to ladies' stalls.

962
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,500
Takako, welcome to membership.

963
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,280
Thank you.

964
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,920
And Logan, thanks for the five gift.

965
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:16,980
Thank you.

966
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:17,880
Thank you.

967
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,120
Thank you.

968
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,400
Go to closet.

969
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,500
Yeah, yeah.

970
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:25,760
Okay.

971
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,540
We got this.

972
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,280
What's in here?

973
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,580
We got the chip.

974
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,120
That's the one to the shutter.

975
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,820
Wait, no.

976
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,640
The chip is just stuff we're collecting, isn't it?

977
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,240
One...

978
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,680
Zero...

979
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,200
Two...

980
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:54,190
Nine...

981
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,230
Yay!

982
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,490
Yeah, shoot the ghost.

983
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:03,870
Shoot it, Rio.

984
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,860
Thank you, Journey.

985
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:26,860
Thank you.

986
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,420
Open it.

987
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,180
I believe in you.

988
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,780
Is it an actual music box?

989
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,600
I don't know.

990
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,080
Shoot it.

991
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,380
Shoot the music box.

992
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,720
Does it?

993
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,460
I don't know.

994
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,980
Check pendant.

995
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,900
Astronaut?

996
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,280
Wait, it won't let me go over to the next thing.

997
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,720
It won't let me check what the...

998
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,580
Take pendant.

999
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,500
Read note.

1000
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,360
There we go.

1001
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,780
Eat it.

1002
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,300
Is she space superstitious?

1003
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:37,620
What?

1004
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,980
Meg?

1005
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,860
Oh my god!

1006
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,920
Meg!

1007
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,080
I'm jogging now.

1008
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,960
No, Meg!

1009
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,780
That's karma for you, Meg.

1010
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,750
Get karma'd.

1011
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:31,990
Play stupid pranks, win stupid prizes.

1012
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:33,670
Save point.

1013
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,570
Sorry, I know I'm over-saving.

1014
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,570
I just don't want to have to redo any steps, you know what I mean?

1015
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,330
Was it family guy, Meg?

1016
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,210
Holy crap, Lois.

1017
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,330
Holy crap, Lois.

1018
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,770
Meg pranked us with a ghost.

1019
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,090
I was doing dishes.

1020
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,190
I'm playing Warframe.

1021
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,090
I'll date Eleanor with your advice.

1022
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,010
She might devour me.

1023
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,790
I think it makes her more likeable.

1024
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:03,590
Thanks, Minto.

1025
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:04,710
I got you.

1026
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,590
Go to hallway.

1027
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:20,170
At least we know it's not haunted by that person, maybe.

1028
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,050
But I just left the room, so it's not haunted anymore.

1029
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:26,850
Go to shutter 5.

1030
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:28,650
No!

1031
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,810
Where is that?

1032
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:30,490
Stop.

1033
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:31,090
Stop.

1034
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:31,470
Stop.

1035
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:32,670
Stop.

1036
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,570
I'm about to send her across the entire map.

1037
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,750
Go to shutter 5.

1038
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,430
Rio's all I need.

1039
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,790
A little bit of Rio's all I need.

1040
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:01,910
Wait, how does it go?

1041
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:06,330
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

1042
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,090
A little bit of Minto is so fun.

1043
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,830
A little bit of... Oh, it looks smoky.

1044
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,110
I think the place might be on fire.

1045
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,780
Oh, where are we?

1046
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,780
Go to guest room 5.

1047
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,900
We are probably about to get ambushed everybody.

1048
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,220
Please remain calm.

1049
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,780
Keep your seatbelts fastened until we turn off the overhead light.

1050
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,240
I knew it was on fire!

1051
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:54,660
Oh my gosh.

1052
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:55,540
Fire!

1053
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,540
Run away!

1054
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,920
Right eye.

1055
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,260
Red eye.

1056
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,380
No.

1057
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,520
Red eye.

1058
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,540
Auto fire.

1059
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,760
I think I have to get that one in the stomach or else it...

1060
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:17,940
Run!

1061
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,280
Run!

1062
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,540
That works too, but...

1063
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,320
Run!

1064
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,580
Run!

1065
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,320
Auto fire.

1066
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,800
Auto fire.

1067
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:39,360
I can't see it.

1068
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,620
Auto fire.

1069
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,420
That's your fault!

1070
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:47,900
Stomach!

1071
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,100
Stomach!

1072
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,480
Stomach!

1073
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,300
Spin gun.

1074
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,200
What should I do?

1075
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:10,910
Auto fire.

1076
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,230
Stomach.

1077
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:18,050
Head.

1078
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,100
Auto fire.

1079
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,540
You got this.

1080
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,700
A little bit more.

1081
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:31,300
There you go.

1082
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,500
Six shots.

1083
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,260
That's a great question.

1084
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,980
Hold on.

1085
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,380
I'm checking.

1086
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:42,780
I'm checking.

1087
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,500
This place is horribly...I hear a fire.

1088
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,800
I don't think we should go in there.

1089
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,960
I see smoke.

1090
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,300
Emergency panel.

1091
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,180
I don't think we should go in there.

1092
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,260
I think Rio you are going to die from...

1093
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,000
I'm in shambles.

1094
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,900
I don't think it's only the emergency panel.

1095
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,980
Surprise, surprise.

1096
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,900
Living area.

1097
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,460
Rio is so into having her hands held.

1098
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,840
Do you think she is a waffle or pancake gal?

1099
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:33,240
She is a waffler because she wants a little bit more of an aggressive hold.

1100
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,640
For those who don't know...

1101
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:41,060
You know when you are hand holding and when you interlock the fingers, it kind of looks like a waffle.

1102
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,320
So it's waffling.

1103
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:50,960
And if you have a normal handshake where your palms are against each other, that's called a pancake.

1104
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,800
I'm explaining the facts of life.

1105
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,720
What am I...

1106
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,020
Check glasses.

1107
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,420
Do you like my sunglasses?

1108
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,480
Wear sunglasses.

1109
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,880
There is no need to wreck it.

1110
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,360
Why did you take your gun out then?

1111
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,150
Rio there is a sun room.

1112
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,230
What is this thing?

1113
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:42,790
Is that a book?

1114
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:43,990
Check book.

1115
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:47,010
That looks like hair.

1116
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:47,650
What is that?

1117
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:48,590
Oh it's a wig.

1118
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:49,450
I was right.

1119
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:50,590
Check wig.

1120
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:53,510
This isn't an ordinary wig.

1121
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:55,350
It's more for costume parties.

1122
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,130
I was going to say we have a cosplayer.

1123
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:58,730
Wear wig.

1124
01:04:59,130 --> 01:04:59,950
Put on the wig?

1125
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:03,230
This isn't the right time for dress up.

1126
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,610
Will you wear wigs?

1127
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,570
Have you worn wigs?

1128
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:09,090
Will you wear wigs?

1129
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,130
What is that though?

1130
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,450
Check book.

1131
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,130
Are you talking about this?

1132
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,430
That's not a book.

1133
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:18,690
What do you think that is you guys?

1134
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,660
Tablet?

1135
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,960
Check tablet.

1136
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,480
How am I supposed to understand that?

1137
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,960
Ok, we are too advanced for her.

1138
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:33,700
Clip file?

1139
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,920
Check file.

1140
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,520
Are you talking about this?

1141
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:41,820
I think she wants to wear the wig you guys.

1142
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:42,820
Album?

1143
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:43,940
Check album.

1144
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,440
Are you talking about this?

1145
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,980
What is it?

1146
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,260
News board.

1147
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,240
Check news board.

1148
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:51,840
What?

1149
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,740
But tablet didn't work?

1150
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,630
Live downloads of breaking news.

1151
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,100

Read news board.

1157
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,740
The station hotel's party just ended a great success?

1158
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,520
That news is strange.

1159
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:27,720
Uh oh.

1160
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,780
Especially after sending a rescue team.

1161
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:30,480
Um.

1162
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,800
Or is it just because our situation hasn't been released to the media yet?

1163
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:35,800
Cover up.

1164
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,220
Cover up.

1165
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,320
Cover up.

1166
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:39,820
Cover up.

1167
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,480
It's a cover up.

1168
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,200
Oh my god.

1169
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,480
Use sunglasses.

1170
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,860
If I were to wear these you wouldn't be able to see my face very well.

1171
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:50,900
That's okay.

1172
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,440
You'd look really cool.

1173
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,340
Okay.

1174
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:54,020
Uh.

1175
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:55,600
Bed.

1176
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,460
I'm scared.

1177
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,820
I think it's going to catch on fire.

1178
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,780
I think that room is on fire.

1179
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,760
I knew it.

1180
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,780
Is there some way of putting out a fire?

1181
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,420
Bucket.

1182
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,600
It's just a bucket.

1183
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,340
Yeah, and you fill it with water.

1184
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,180
Take bucket.

1185
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,240
The bucket is too close to the fire.

1186
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:32,820
Okay.

1187
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,180
I can't get it.

1188
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,800
Shoot bucket.

1189
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,100
Did you see how far it flew?

1190
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,240
What is that?

1191
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,780
Oh my god.

1192
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,660
Wow, I can't believe shooting things actually works.

1193
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,540
Shoot fire extinguisher.

1194
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,380
Yeah.

1195
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,260
Shoot it.

1196
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,600
Shoot it.

1197
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,720
I did it.

1198
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,180
A miracle.

1199
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:16,360
Are you okay?

1200
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,060
Oh god.

1201
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,740
We killed Rio.

1202
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,900
Do you think Rio would survive Metal Gear Solid?

1203
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,780
I think she would love it because of the codec.

1204
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,300
Yeah, that was so easy.

1205
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:38,720
Nice.

1206
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,800
Hold on, we are not done in here.

1207
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,200
Check bed.

1208
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,440
Yeah, your favorite spot baby girl.

1209
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,900
There is a ticket.

1210
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,360
Oh, there is a person.

1211
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,560
Maybe don't check her leg.

1212
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,900
Um, corpse or coat.

1213
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah.

1214
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,200
I didn't even notice the dead lady.

1215
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,000
Bathrobe.

1216
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:24,060
Um, check bathrobe.

1217
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:25,760
Yeah.

1218
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,840
Yes there is.

1219
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,860
Search bathrobe.

1220
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,720
Bathrobe.

1221
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,240
Bathrobe pocket.

1222
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,080
Check bathrobe pocket.

1223
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,440
Check pocket.

1224
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,260
The bathrobe.

1225
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,620
What else?

1226
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,580
What do we say?

1227
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:03,700
Oh.

1228
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,000
Shoot bathrobe.

1229
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,020
Then why do you get into position?

1230
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,540
Why do you tease me?

1231
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:22,880
You go through all the effort of looking like you are about to do it.

1232
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,460
But you never... What the heck?

1233
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,800
Um, check pocket.

1234
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:29,880
Huh?

1235
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,020
Of what?

1236
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:34,380
Check bathrobe pocket.

1237
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,500
It's the hotel.

1238
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,540
There is nothing strange about it.

1239
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,780
Inside bathrobe.

1240
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,700
The bathrobe?

1241
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,500
I don't need that.

1242
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,560
Oh my gosh.

1243
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,600
At least we got a different answer.

1244
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,760
I tried search pocket.

1245
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,760
Search pocket.

1246
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:00,880
No!

1247
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,520
Stop.

1248
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:05,340
Bed.

1249
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,100
I feel so...

1250
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:15,800
I feel too much in command.

1251
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,520
I feel naughty.

1252
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,960
Like stop bed.

1253
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
Oh gosh.

1254
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,620
Move bathrobe.

1255
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,740
Search bathrobe.

1256
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,260
I don't know what to say.

1257
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,660
Check inside bathrobe.

1258
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,660
Check inside.

1259
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,960
Inspect bathrobe.

1260
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:08,320
Oh my gosh.

1261
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,600
Check card maybe.

1262
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,080
Check card.

1263
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,340
Oh my gosh.

1264
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:18,240
Yes.

1265
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:19,740
Yes.

1266
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:20,680
Yes.

1267
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,020
Take card.

1268
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,240
Take card.

1269
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,160
Take card in pocket.

1270
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,320
That's not what I said.

1271
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,640
Card in pocket.

1272
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,200
The bathrobe.

1273
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,360
Oh gosh.

1274
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,580
Ticket maybe.

1275
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,980
Pick up ticket.

1276
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,020
I've said check bathrobe pocket.

1277
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:03,300
I'll try.

1278
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,240
Check bathrobe pocket.

1279
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,580
That's what she says every time.

1280
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,260
She says that every time.

1281
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,060
Try using colors.

1282
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:13,660
That's a good idea.

1283
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,180
Yellow card.

1284
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:20,000
Throw what?

1285
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,500
What did she just say?

1286
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,220
Yellow card.

1287
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,480
Yellow ticket.

1288
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,080
She wanted me to throw a pillow.

1289
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,780
I don't know.

1290
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,340
I really don't know what to say.

1291
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,820
I'm so... I don't know.

1292
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,420
She has brain damage from the smoke inhalation.

1293
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,060
And the fire extinguisher.

1294
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,260
You are slow with thinking.

1295
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,160
Cognitive.

1296
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,640
Function.

1297
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,320

1298
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:17,340
Breast pocket of bathrobe.

1299
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,160
I don't know.

1300
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,400
I don't know.

1301
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,600
I don't know.

1302
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,500
I don't know how

1303
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:33,950
to...

1304
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:35,410
Pick up bathrobe.

1305
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:38,390

1306
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,160
Check ticket.

1307
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,700
Check...

1308
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,940
What did I say?

1309
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,320
Check card.

1310
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,500

1311
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,380
Please take it.

1312
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,080
Take card.

1313
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,140
No!

1314
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,900
Stop.

1315
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:08,760
Stop.

1316
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,360
Stop.

1317
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,080
Bed.

1318
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:13,880
Run.

1319
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,720
Oh my god.

1320
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:27,100
You guys keep sending me variations, but I've tried them.

1321
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,900
Game facts says check pocket of bathrobe.

1322
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,180
That's what I said though.

1323
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,140
I said that.

1324
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:34,440
I'll try.

1325
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,200
Check pocket of bathrobe.

1326
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:38,620
See?

1327
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,820
She says that every time.

1328
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:42,860
Oh my gosh.

1329
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,360
Fukuro!

1330
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,100
Amy, that was my birthday so I figured I'd share the happiness with my own.

1331
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,720
It seems you have plenty of screaming in your game.

1332
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,720
That's okay.

1333
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,600
I can sing.

1334
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,820
Happy birthday to you.

1335
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:04,740
Happy birthday to you.

1336
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,980
Happy birthday dear Fukuro.

1337
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,160
Happy birthday to you.

1338
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,360
Thank you for the HAKODONA!

1339
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:19,700
Thank you!

1340
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,640
Okay.

1341
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:22,940
What was it say?

1342
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,120
They said that game facts... Let me see if I can try it.

1343
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,960
Check pocket of bathrobe.

1344
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,340
I tried it though.

1345
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,460
I tried it.

1346
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:35,600
Oh...

1347
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:42,270
Check pocket of bathrobe.

1348
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:45,090
No!

1349
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,070
Fine.

1350
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:48,470
You know what?

1351
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,290
We'll give her a break.

1352
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:51,930
We'll give her a break from the bathrobe.

1353
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,730
Oh gosh.

1354
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,310
That scared me.

1355
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:59,270
This guy is sick popular.

1356
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,650
This is the one.

1357
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,090
Pat head.

1358
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:22,430
This guy is sick pompadour.

1359
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:29,190
I can't.

1360
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,380
Yes ma'am.

1361
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,640
Search wig.

1362
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:42,480
No!

1363
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:43,320
No!

1364
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:43,880
No!

1365
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:44,620
Stop!

1366
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:45,900
Stop!

1367
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,320
Bathroom.

1368
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:58,160
Search corpse hair.

1369
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,200
Rude.

1370
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:05,920
He doesn't look that old.

1371
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,760
He just looks a little grey.

1372
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,160
He's obviously a cosplayer.

1373
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,080
It's Homestuck.

1374
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,080
Don't be so rude.

1375
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,320
Oh gosh.

1376
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,960
Check sink.

1377
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,340
Take mobile phone.

1378
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,780
Why does he have it then?

1379
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,280
Use mobile phone.

1380
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,920
They just throw the sandwich and they go after that?

1381
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,200
Probably.

1382
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,120
Take off wig.

1383
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:03,200
I think I can't say wig you guys.

1384
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,100
Stop.

1385
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,240
I think she thinks... I don't know.

1386
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,480
I think she's thinking something else when I say wig.

1387
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,420
Bathroom.

1388
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:16,140
Oh my gosh.

1389
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,860
Look under hair.

1390
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:23,820
No.

1391
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,540
Check hair.

1392
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:28,980
Yeah.

1393
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:31,380
Yes.

1394
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:32,420
Yes.

1395
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:32,820
Yes.

1396
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,400
It's not what I asked.

1397
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,280
Search corpse hair.

1398
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,300
But it's shiny.

1399
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,840
Oh gosh.

1400
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,820
This is the bed all over again.

1401
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:50,200
Head.

1402
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,760
I

1403
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:02,270
can't say wig you guys.

1404
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:04,410
Search head.

1405
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:18,130
Remove hair.

1406
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:18,790
Head.

1407
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,590
Alcohol and anger.

1408
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:31,110
Take hair.

1409
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:33,650
You know what?

1410
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:33,950
Fine.

1411
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,590
We'll just go back and forth.

1412
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,950
This room is torturous.

1413
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:43,330
Okay.

1414
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,110
We are back here.

1415
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:49,130
What was it that the GameFAQ said?

1416
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:01,450
Do a pose in front of the dead guy.

1417
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:04,350
Do a sexy pose.

1418
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:13,450
She doesn't want to have a girly fun sleep over time.

1419
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:20,370
She doesn't want to get stripped down into her underwear and throw a pillow and have the feathers go everywhere.

1420
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:27,550
And she's just giggling and laughing in her underwear while the feathers just cover her body and cover the air.

1421
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,350
And she's just having a giggly time.

1422
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,230
She doesn't want to do anything fun.

1423
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:36,070
Oh wait.

1424
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:36,490
I read that.

1425
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:37,430
Thank you Coffin though.

1426
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:39,290
Red side welcome to membership.

1427
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:43,810
GameFAQ says check bathrobe and then check pocket of bathrobe.

1428
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:44,650
Okay.

1429
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,550
Check bathrobe.

1430
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:50,830
Okay.

1431
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,930
Check pocket of bathrobe.

1432
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,040
That's every time.

1433
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:03,820
Okay.

1434
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,580
We are back here.

1435
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,880
Time to try and get this guy again.

1436
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:14,220
Oh yeah.

1437
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,040
Check behind corpse.

1438
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,040
Check behind head.

1439
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:31,000
I can't.

1440
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,360
I'm stuck in a loop.

1441
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:47,230
Check bathrobe pocket.

1442
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,920
Check bathrobe pocket.

1443
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:57,680
The bathroom.

1444
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,180
Okay.

1445
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,420
It's fine because we do have something we need to do in here.

1446
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,000
We just don't know how to do it either.

1447
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,780
What's the GameFAQ say for this one?

1448
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,040
What does the GameFAQ say?

1449
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,420
You're awfully slow with instructions.

1450
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,380
I'm going to google it myself.

1451
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,480
Hold on.

1452
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,140
Lifeline.

1453
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,300
Maybe making a statement helps?

1454
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,820
Is that how the game works?

1455
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,540
I can't remember.

1456
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,040
It's check wig?

1457
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:10,640
No.

1458
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,520
Check wig.

1459
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,440
Stop!

1460
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,480
Stop!

1461
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:24,080
Oh look under wig.

1462
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:24,420
Okay.

1463
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,180
Bathroom.

1464
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,440
Let's try that.

1465
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,640
Look under wig.

1466
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,460
Sorry.

1467
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,180
Look under wig.

1468
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:39,920
Yes!

1469
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:40,740
Yes!

1470
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,240
Yes!

1471
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:41,960
Yes!

1472
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:42,160
Yes!

1473
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,300
Oh my god yes!

1474
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,100
Oh my god!

1475
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,740
We got one!

1476
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,520
We got one!

1477
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,300
Stop!

1478
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,460
Seashells by the seashore.

1479
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,280
No way!

1480
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:18,620
No!

1481
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:21,940
Oh okay.

1482
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:22,900
Okay.

1483
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,240
Yes!

1484
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,680
Let's start with an easy one.

1485
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,940
That's an easy one?

1486
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,780
She's warming up.

1487
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,600
Oh my god.

1488
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,020
I can't remember all this.

1489
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,460
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

1490
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,580
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

1491
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,440
What?

1492
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:15,380
She stood on a balcony inexplicably mimicking him.

1493
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,700
Hiccuping him.

1494
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,440
What the hell?

1495
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,840
We went through so much trouble to get that.

1496
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,680
What was it?

1497
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:58,520
She inexplicably hiccuped on him on the balcony where he was inexplicably...

1498
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,460
I don't remember.

1499
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:07,180
The Seashells command lets you heal every time you complete three tongue twisters.

1500
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,600
The only way to heal outside of the limited capsules.

1501
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,640
The game never tells you this.

1502
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:13,720
No way.

1503
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,420
Wait seriously?

1504
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,420
Hold on.

1505
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,740
Seashells.

1506
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:25,480
Special.

1507
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:25,680
Oh.

1508
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:28,980
She...

1509
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,940
She sells.

1510
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:33,700
Oh.

1511
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,320
She sells.

1512
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,480
Okay, okay.

1513
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,980
Okay, I got this you guys.

1514
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:40,580
I got this.

1515
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:42,620
I got this.

1516
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,720
Thank you Tom!

1517
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,420
Oh my god.

1518
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:45,360
Yes.

1519
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:48,840
Okay.

1520
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,060
Pick up six pick up sticks quickly.

1521
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,600
Okay, nice.

1522
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:02,940
Okay.

1523
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,720
Oh easy, easy.

1524
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:09,760
What?

1525
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,680
There is more to it?

1526
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,160
She sells seashells on the seashore.

1527
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,620
She sells seashells.

1528
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:18,380
She is short.

1529
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,140
No!

1530
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:20,260
No!

1531
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,000
There is more!

1532
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,120
Hold on.

1533
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:27,640
I am googling this.

1534
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,260
Lifeline tongue twisters.

1535
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,680
I can't remember them.

1536
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:32,680
They are too long.

1537
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:34,400
No!

1538
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:35,600
Okay, hold on.

1539
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,160
Where are the tongue twisters?

1540
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,500
Where are the tongue twisters?

1541
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,180
Oh, she sells.

1542
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:45,840
Minigames.

1543
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:46,720
Minigames.

1544
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,540
Minigames.

1545
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:48,760
I can't remember them.

1546
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:49,300
Please.

1547
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,600
Complete the phrase.

1548
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,760
No, no, no.

1549
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,580
She sells.

1550
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,020
She sells.

1551
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:00,580
Okay, okay.

1552
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,840
I have them written down.

1553
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,100
I have them written down.

1554
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:03,360
Okay.

1555
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:07,620
Oh, yes.

1556
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:09,800
Okay.

1557
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:14,300
Oh my god, there is really...

1558
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:16,980
Okay.

1559
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,980
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

1560
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,060
Okay.

1561
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:24,600
Yeah.

1562
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,220
Okay.

1563
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,080
I have it written down.

1564
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,260
Okay.

1565
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:38,360
A noise annoys an oyster, but a noisy noise annoys an oyster more.

1566
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:39,680
Okay.

1567
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,280
Oh my gosh, I am really good at this.

1568
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:42,980
Okay.

1569
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:45,820
Oh!

1570
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,240
Okay.

1571
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:54,620
Okay.

1572
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:55,680
I got it written.

1573
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,960
Good.

1574
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,720
Heal.

1575
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,500
Thanks for the entertainment.

1576
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,000
Oh my gosh, it really healed.

1577
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,100
It really worked.

1578
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,340
Okay, I'm going to have those on standby.

1579
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,260
Oh my god.

1580
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,860
Okay, now Rio, bed.

1581
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,580
Oh yeah, baby girl.

1582
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,040
I am an enunciating queen.

1583
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,620
Check, bathrobe, pocket.

1584
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,320
Check, bathrobe, pocket.

1585
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,100
Are you talking about this?

1586
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:49,560
Check the pocket of the bathrobe.

1587
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,380
There is something inside.

1588
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,840
It's a chip.

1589
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,500
That worked.

1590
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,220
Oh my god.

1591
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,900
Finally, we did everything in here.

1592
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,340
Oh wait.

1593
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,380
There is a save point.

1594
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,000
Oh thank god.

1595
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,120
Check dresser.

1596
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,800
Yeah, I'll save the game.

1597
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:18,380
Don't worry.

1598
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,660
Don't worry.

1599
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,420
I'll save the game.

1600
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:24,680
Okay.

1601
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:26,680
Okay.

1602
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:27,920
Save point.

1603
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:28,900
The save point.

1604
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:29,420
Okay.

1605
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:38,330
Yeah, the low-pitched voice worked.

1606
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:41,490
It's discriminatory against my voice.

1607
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:44,330
It's discriminating.

1608
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:45,410
We got 9 chips.

1609
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:50,750
My voice recognition has gone down significantly.

1610
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:55,250
It's gone down so much.

1611
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:55,550
Okay.

1612
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:58,050
She's traumatized on the ground.

1613
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,490
Okay, leave room.

1614
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,210
Okay, bye bye.

1615
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:04,730
Run.

1616
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:07,870
You did it.

1617
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:09,610
I did it.

1618
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:17,980
Oh my gosh.

1619
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:18,380
Okay.

1620
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,860
Okay.

1621
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,360
What?

1622
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:15,380
What if... What if I took my girlfriend up into space to like...

1623
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:17,970
To kill her off.

1624
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:24,570
In like some elaborate... Like I was gonna put her into the air chute and send her out into space.

1625
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:26,190
And I'm just like, oh great.

1626
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:29,010
My girlfriend is safe.

1627
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:34,850
We all flew up here.

1628
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:39,150
Operator.

1629
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:40,530
What should I do?

1630
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:46,830
I guess we can't go to shutter 8.

1631
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:47,610
It doesn't let us.

1632
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:49,030
Are we going to the moon suite?

1633
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:50,730
Oh my gosh.

1634
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:52,030
Butts everywhere.

1635
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:54,410
Go to shutter 6.

1636
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:56,570
Shutter 6.

1637
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:57,230
Okay.

1638
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:57,710
Yeah.

1639
01:33:58,190 --> 01:33:58,510
Run.

1640
01:33:58,830 --> 01:33:58,830
Oh.

1641
01:33:59,370 --> 01:33:59,750
Run.

1642
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:00,510
Yes.

1643
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,250
Yes.

1644
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:07,510
I like how she's like, if you find my boyfriend...

1645
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:09,530
What did you say?

1646
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:11,030
Oh my gosh.

1647
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:11,850
Middle eye.

1648
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:13,290
Oh.

1649
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:13,770
Run.

1650
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:19,650
Okay, we wait for it to turn right.

1651
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:22,030
Right eye.

1652
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,350
Middle eye.

1653
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,410
Right eye.

1654
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:31,290
Middle eye.

1655
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:33,370
Middle eye.

1656
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:35,610
Left eye.

1657
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,580
Left eye.

1658
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:54,820
Auto fire.

1659
01:34:58,740 --> 01:34:59,860
Reload.

1660
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:05,530
I didn't realize that...

1661
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:07,890
Red eye.

1662
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:09,810
Auto fire.

1663
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,710
Please reload your aim.

1664
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:15,350
Oh.

1665
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:16,330
Run.

1666
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,440
Body?

1667
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,100
Body.

1668
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:27,800
Body.

1669
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:29,780
Mouth.

1670
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:31,240
Mouth.

1671
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,220
Auto aim.

1672
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,920
I mean...

1673
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:35,320
Mouth.

1674
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,720
Auto fire.

1675
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:38,840
Oh no.

1676
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:39,620
Mouth.

1677
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:40,980
Mouth.

1678
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:43,380
Tail.

1679
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:45,760
I don't know.

1680
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:46,280
Body.

1681
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,040
Body.

1682
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:57,910
Oh my gosh.

1683
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:58,630
Oh my gosh.

1684
01:35:58,710 --> 01:35:59,210
Run!

1685
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:02,530
Why did you stop there?

1686
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:03,190
Tail.

1687
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:06,150
Tail.

1688
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:07,990
Shoot.

1689
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:09,970
Shoot.

1690
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:11,870
Auto fire.

1691
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:14,990
Tail.

1692
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:18,530
Oh my gosh.

1693
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:19,730
Tail.

1694
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:21,810
Run.

1695
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:25,890
Yes.

1696
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,650
Nice, nice, nice.

1697
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:27,750
Tail.

1698
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:28,330
Tail.

1699
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:31,170
Okay.

1700
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:32,090
I was trying.

1701
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:34,730
Oh my gosh.

1702
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:45,840
Where are we going?

1703
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,780
Shutter 6.

1704
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:50,860
Run.

1705
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:52,640
Oh yeah.

1706
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,140
We got to do the cells.

1707
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,160
We got to do more tongue twisters.

1708
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:02,500
Here we go.

1709
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,220
That's so good.

1710
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,040
Thank you Tom.

1711
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:08,680
Oh my gosh.

1712
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:09,940
For teaching me about that.

1713
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,660
We'll save so much health.

1714
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:17,500
Okay.

1715
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:19,360
Yeah.

1716
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,040
Where is...

1717
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,160
Where is here?

1718
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:29,340
What was that?

1719
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:31,560
What was that?

1720
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:33,280
What's that?

1721
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,060
Is this the moon suite?

1722
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,240
We are going to open it up and we are going to be flashed with bare flesh.

1723
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:42,940
Wait.

1724
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:44,560
I didn't say you could go in there.

1725
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:48,920
Wait a second.

1726
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,240
Okay.

1727
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,160
Okay.

1728
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:00,700
Oh gosh.

1729
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,000
Okay.

1730
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:02,800
What am I supposed to see?

1731
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,020
Oh look at her.

1732
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:04,780
She looks so cool.

1733
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,900
Is this a hidden object game?

1734
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:10,220
What am I...

1735
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:15,540
What am I supposed to be seeing?

1736
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:18,020
Oh!

1737
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:18,460
Stop!

1738
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:19,980
Person!

1739
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:42,610
What?

1740
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:46,970
Human!

1741
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,570
What was I supposed to tell her?

1742
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:03,610
I told her to stop.

1743
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:05,810
I told her...

1744
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:06,410
That's good.

1745
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,830
About time.

1746
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:20,410
Rescue team.

1747
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:22,370
That's wonderful.

1748
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:30,530
You are supposed to say turn right?

1749
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:30,970
Okay.

1750
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:35,750
That's okay.

1751
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:44,310
Yeah, so true.

1752
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:47,470
Good point.

1753
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:53,930
Oh no!

1754
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:56,610
Why didn't you say that sooner?

1755
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:59,150
I have an operator backing me up.

1756
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:00,990
He'll open it for us.

1757
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:03,290
You can do it, right?

1758
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:07,690
Why can't you?

1759
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:08,490
It's just a shutter.

1760
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,110
Don't worry, I know you can do it.

1761
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:12,810
He says he can.

1762
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:17,990
You definitely lied.

1763
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:27,970
I won't board the shuttle.

1764
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,350
He's going down with the ship.

1765
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:38,750
Listen operator.

1766
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,430
I told you that I need proper guidance.

1767
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:45,430
The way things are going, I fear for my future.

1768
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:47,610
Your future?

1769
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:48,730
That's so dramatic.

1770
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:51,330
Let's search this room.

1771
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:52,570
I love the music in here.

1772
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:53,190
It's so good.

1773
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,990
I'm afraid for my future.

1774
01:40:56,370 --> 01:40:57,730
Honestly, you're safe.

1775
01:40:58,830 --> 01:41:00,870
Rio, that's so relatable.

1776
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:03,230
Oh no!

1777
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:15,560
I wanted to search in there.

1778
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:17,960
Aw man.

1779
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:20,980
Aw man.

1780
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:25,860
Okay.

1781
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,360
What is that?

1782
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,400
There's a room on the other side of the hall.

1783
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,520
Oh wait, maybe not a room.

1784
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,620
Maybe we can't go in there.

1785
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,160
There was a room on the other side too, but it doesn't have a label.

1786
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,200
Like on the other side of shutter 6, you see it?

1787
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,460
Let's play.

1788
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,840
What is it?

1789
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:50,540
Sorry!

1790
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:53,460
Seashells!

1791
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,200
Seashells!

1792
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:01,980
Seashells!

1793
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,600
Seashells!

1794
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,540
Sea...Seashells?

1795
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,520
Seashells.

1796
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:11,820
What?

1797
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,520
No way!

1798
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,580
Oh, she sells.

1799
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:17,180
What?

1800
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:17,640
No!

1801
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,140
She sells.

1802
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:21,400
Uh oh.

1803
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,800
She won't let me do it, you guys.

1804
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,100
I'm gonna go back to guest room 5.

1805
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:29,740
Guest room 5.

1806
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,720
I'm gonna go save.

1807
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,080
Actually, we don't really need...

1808
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,960
Well, run.

1809
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,900
I was gonna say we don't really need to save, but you know what?

1810
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:39,520
It's actually fine.

1811
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:42,920
Is there a cool town?

1812
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,740
I think it's consultation first.

1813
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:53,290
I don't think so.

1814
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:54,730
Hold on.

1815
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:57,570
Oh gosh, I keep...

1816
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:00,290
You're welcome.

1817
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:00,750
Ok.

1818
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:01,650
She sells.

1819
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:13,570
There we go.

1820
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:17,070
Oh yeah.

1821
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:18,090
Oh yeah.

1822
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:21,430
Ok.

1823
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:23,050
I'm getting my thing pulled up.

1824
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:26,450
Ok.

1825
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:27,430
Ok.

1826
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:27,890
Ok.

1827
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:30,990
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

1828
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:32,830
Oh yeah.

1829
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:34,110
We're healing.

1830
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:34,630
We're healing.

1831
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,190
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

1832
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:39,630
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

1833
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:41,550
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't Fuzzy Wuzzy.

1834
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:42,830
I know this one!

1835
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:46,090
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

1836
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:47,290
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

1837
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:48,950
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't Fuzzy Wuzzy.

1838
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:50,030
Not bad.

1839
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:53,110
I like that one.

1840
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:08,350
Ok, your turn.

1841
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:20,350
How many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

1842
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:26,030
I did.

1843
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:28,370
You're welcome.

1844
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:33,270
Oh, it didn't heal everything.

1845
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:39,390
She sells...

1846
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:41,590
One more, one more.

1847
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:43,430
Yes.

1848
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,690
Let's start with an easy one.

1849
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:48,550
Okay, give me what I haven't done before.

1850
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:57,390
Pick up six pick up sticks quickly.

1851
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,430
Okay,

1852
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:08,510
your turn.

1853
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:14,070
Awesome.

1854
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:17,770
Repeat after me.

1855
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,190
Don't be a pepper.

1856
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:20,690
I saw Esau kissing Kate.

1857
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:22,350
Kate saw I saw Esau.

1858
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:25,310
Esau saw that I saw Kate and Kate saw I saw Esau.

1859
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:26,730
This is not English.

1860
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:27,610
Okay, your turn.

1861
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:28,330
What?

1862
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:35,650
I saw Esau kissing Kate.

1863
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:37,450
Kate saw I saw Esau.

1864
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:41,250
Esau saw that I saw Kate and Kate saw I saw Esau.

1865
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:43,090
What?

1866
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:44,930
What are you talking about?

1867
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:47,170
I read it straight from the thing.

1868
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:50,090
I saw... who... first... what?

1869
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:51,650
This is not real.

1870
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:54,370
I got robbed for real.

1871
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:55,810
I got robbed.

1872
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:57,690
Okay, never mind.

1873
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:58,590
Save point.

1874
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:01,490
I give up.

1875
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,350
Your complaining got registered.

1876
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:05,470
No, it didn't.

1877
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,720
I saw Esau kissing Kate.

1878
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,600
Kate saw I saw Esau.

1879
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:17,220
Esau saw that I saw Kate and Kate saw I saw Esau.

1880
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:20,620
That's just... that is not English.

1881
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:21,920
Those are not real words.

1882
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,520
That's not real English.

1883
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,100
Call her a doody head.

1884
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:27,980
I will.

1885
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,820
Yeah, you saw a lot.

1886
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:39,960
Esau is supposed to be a name of a person, but like... who hates their child to name them Esau?

1887
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:42,880
Doody head.

1888
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:45,000
Poopy.

1889
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:48,660
Poop.

1890
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,380
Leave room.

1891
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:58,240
Esau, Esau.

1892
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:59,880
Esau, Esau.

1893
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:04,820
Esau's mom.

1894
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:08,820
They spell it on GameFAQs as E-S-A-W.

1895
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:13,080
So it's like literally saw, but with... but with E in front of it.

1896
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:15,740
Where should I go?

1897
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,420
Maybe that's why it looks so weird to me.

1898
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,480
Like, yeah, like E-girl, but yeah, but Esau.

1899
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,300
Yeah, exactly.

1900
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,500
So maybe that's why I didn't register it as a name.

1901
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,560
Esau, Esau, Esau, Esau.

1902
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,520
Esau, Esau, Esau, Esau.

1903
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,740
Esau, Esau, Esau, Esau.

1904
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:41,460
Esau, Esau, Esau, Esau, Esau.

1905
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,480
Esau, Esau.

1906
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:46,460
Go to elevator hall.

1907
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:50,260
Run.

1908
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:51,480
Run.

1909
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,240
Like, like your life depends on it.

1910
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:00,620
Look at her.

1911
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,140
I think she picked up a little bit of speed.

1912
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:12,470
See, there is a door down there.

1913
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:16,310
Enemy has...

1914
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,230
Run!

1915
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:19,710
Oh no.

1916
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:21,110
Oh gosh.

1917
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:22,770
Head!

1918
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:24,470
Stomach!

1919
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,670
Stomach!

1920
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:28,510
Head!

1921
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:30,170
Mouth!

1922
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:32,470
Mouth.

1923
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:34,270
Mouth.

1924
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:35,690
Oh!

1925
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:36,670
Run!

1926
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:38,710
Oh no.

1927
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:39,230
Okay.

1928
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:41,730
Inner mouth!

1929
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:43,390
Inner mouth!

1930
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:44,910
Shoot!

1931
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:46,710
Auto...

1932
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:47,450
Shoot!

1933
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:50,130
Auto shoot!

1934
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:51,810
Oh no, not body.

1935
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:52,670
Inner mouth!

1936
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:54,590
Inner mouth!

1937
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:00,310
Let's go.

1938
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:06,070
Number two, inner mouth.

1939
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:06,890
Where are we?

1940
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:09,490
Oh, elevator hall.

1941
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:12,230
Yeah, exactly.

1942
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:13,250
That's where we were going.

1943
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:19,280
Yeah.

1944
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,180
I can't, I'm here and all that.

1945
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,640
That's a great question.

1946
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:30,240
Uh...

1947
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,040
I guess we go...

1948
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,120
Receiving point.

1949
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:36,520
Run!

1950
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:38,720
Run!

1951
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,100
Inner mouth!

1952
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:42,440
No, no.

1953
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,460
Actually, oh that works.

1954
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,140
Inner mouth!

1955
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,260
Auto fire!

1956
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:49,940
No, inner mouth!

1957
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,640
Oh my gosh.

1958
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:53,980
No!

1959
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:55,720
Inner

1960
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:01,860
mouth!

1961
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:02,780
Dodge!

1962
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,820
Inner mouth!

1963
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,960
Inner mouth!

1964
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:10,540
Inner mouth!

1965
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,680
Dodge!

1966
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,440
Inner

1967
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:17,730
mouth!

1968
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:19,470
Recover!

1969
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:21,670
Oh my god.

1970
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:22,790
Recover!

1971
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:25,990
Dodge!

1972
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:27,690
Dodge left!

1973
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:29,650
Dodge left!

1974
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:30,930
No!

1975
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:32,190
That's not even...

1976
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:32,510
Run!

1977
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:48,110
Left eye!

1978
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:49,730
Left eye!

1979
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:51,850
Left eye!

1980
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:53,470
Left eye!

1981
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:54,990
Dodge right!

1982
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:55,850
No!

1983
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:05,860
Oh, I'm about to die!

1984
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:06,580
Oh my gosh.

1985
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:26,270
Dodge left and she moves, she's like turn right!

1986
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:28,810
That's not even the way that I said!

1987
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:32,110
Oh my god!

1988
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:40,140
Okay.

1989
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,380
Alright, we're gonna do another tongue twister.

1990
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:45,780
She sells.

1991
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:47,220
Yep.

1992
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,300
Here we go, okay.

1993
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:51,980
So you wanna play tongue twister with me?

1994
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,960
I like the way she breaks her neck when I ask her that.

1995
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:55,400
Yep.

1996
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,680
So you wanna play tongue twister with me?

1997
01:51:58,740 --> 01:51:59,180
Yes.

1998
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:02,400
Let's start with an easy one.

1999
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,540
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

2000
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:07,180
Okay.

2001
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:08,140
Okay, your turn.

2002
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:11,960
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

2003
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:12,740
Good!

2004
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:15,360
Repeat after me.

2005
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,020
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

2006
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:19,480
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

2007
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,520
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't Fuzzy Wuzzy.

2008
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,900
Okay, your turn.

2009
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,020
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

2010
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,220
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

2011
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,820
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't Fuzzy Wuzzy.

2012
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:29,620
Good!

2013
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:30,040
Yeah!

2014
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:32,160
Repeat after me.

2015
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,960
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

2016
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:38,700
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

2017
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:43,400
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

2018
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:45,140
Okay.

2019
01:52:47,640 --> 01:53:04,840
We always got the Peter Piper peppers!

2020
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:11,180
Okay, um... save point.

2021
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,720
No, save point.

2022
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,300
No, save point.

2023
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:18,800
Save point.

2024
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:22,500
Save point.

2025
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:29,560
We got it.

2026
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,180
We got, we got.

2027
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,860
Okay, I'm just gonna save so that she's full health.

2028
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,480
Holy moly.

2029
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,580
Okay, let's go.

2030
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:45,960
She wants you bad.

2031
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:47,320
She wants me bad, bad.

2032
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:48,560
But can you blame her?

2033
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,760
You know, look at her.

2034
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:54,740
She's so... desperate.

2035
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:56,880
Leave room.

2036
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:05,120
Run.

2037
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,360
I'm so commanding.

2038
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:12,080
She probably just has fallen for me with how... stern I am, you know?

2039
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:15,180
I'm just so like... I'm like, run, Maria.

2040
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:17,080
Go to the elevator hall.

2041
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:19,880
Go... oh.

2042
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,320
Go to the elevator hall.

2043
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:25,280
Oh yeah.

2044
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,000
Run.

2045
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:29,340
Yes.

2046
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,800
You have a girlfriend though?

2047
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:35,180
I mean, she can't help her feelings for me.

2048
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,040
You know?

2049
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:38,660
She can't help it.

2050
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:45,650
Alright, let's get ambushed, baby!

2051
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:47,230
Yeah!

2052
01:54:48,570 --> 01:54:48,950
Enemy.

2053
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:52,650
Enemy has been spotted.

2054
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:53,690
Run.

2055
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:55,090
Run.

2056
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:00,170
Stomach.

2057
01:55:01,210 --> 01:55:02,490
Alright, inner mouth.

2058
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:04,530
Run.

2059
01:55:06,830 --> 01:55:07,570
Inner mouth.

2060
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:09,950
Auto fire.

2061
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:12,710
No, inner mouth.

2062
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:14,350
Inner mouth.

2063
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:16,910
Auto fire.

2064
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:23,250
Run.

2065
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:24,630
Rio, you did not get a single hit?

2066
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:26,050
Auto fire.

2067
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:35,790
Oh my god.

2068
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:36,410
Reload.

2069
01:55:39,490 --> 01:55:40,210
Rio.

2070
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:41,970
Run.

2071
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:54,170
Oh... my god.

2072
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:56,370
Oh.

2073
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:01,070
The eye is a weak spot when it rears up.

2074
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:01,970
Oh, really?

2075
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:05,450
I thought just the inner mouth was the...

2076
01:56:07,610 --> 01:56:10,070
was the... weak point.

2077
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:10,870
Good to know.

2078
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:14,410
Okay.

2079
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:16,710
Elevator hall.

2080
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:18,890
The elevator hall.

2081
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:19,370
Okay.

2082
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:23,430
The audacity of missing every shot then saying that was easy.

2083
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:31,050
Let's check... we went to the...

2084
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,610
I think actually we just get ambushed in this room.

2085
01:56:33,710 --> 01:56:35,530
So it doesn't really matter where we go, huh?

2086
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:38,350
Okay.

2087
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:39,290
Receiving port.

2088
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:40,530
The receiving port.

2089
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:41,150
Okay.

2090
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:44,250
Run.

2091
01:56:44,610 --> 01:56:44,970
Eye.

2092
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:45,630
Run.

2093
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:46,310
Eye.

2094
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:46,930
Run.

2095
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:48,270
Yes.

2096
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:52,300
Oh my gosh.

2097
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:53,100
Inner mouth.

2098
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:53,600
Back.

2099
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:55,020
Inner mouth.

2100
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:07,230
She's so slow to dodge.

2101
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:08,190
Inner mouth.

2102
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:09,490
Yes.

2103
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:26,270
Target front.

2104
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,950
Number

2105
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:34,410
two.

2106
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:35,470
Right eye.

2107
01:57:35,730 --> 01:57:36,030
Run.

2108
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:36,710
Left.

2109
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:19,330
Let's move on.

2110
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:21,610
Where?

2111
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:22,770
Inner mouth.

2112
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:24,290
The receiving port is up ahead.

2113
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:28,390
Receiving port.

2114
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,650
The receiving port.

2115
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:30,250
Okay.

2116
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,120
Oh my god.

2117
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:47,300
What?

2118
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,520
Did you not get ambushed?

2119
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:00,020
Okay.

2120
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,020
It's kind of nice, the silence, right?

2121
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:17,720
Tell the operator to open the shutter right now.

2122
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:19,900
Open the shutter.

2123
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:25,980
Right button.

2124
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:29,800
Oh, that's not what I said.

2125
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:30,960
Power panel.

2126
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,160
She's so rude.

2127
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:37,080
Left power panel.

2128
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:43,760
Okay.

2129
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:44,880
I'll do it.

2130
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,660
She's so rude.

2131
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:48,160
Oh, okay.

2132
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:49,080
That's all I gotta do.

2133
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:53,900
I thought we...

2134
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,840
I didn't realize...

2135
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:59,220
Oh yeah, play the tongue twister.

2136
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:00,280
Oh my gosh, you're so right.

2137
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:01,500
Oh wait, no.

2138
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:02,720
Our health is actually pretty good.

2139
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:06,880
Oh, oh, oh.

2140
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,060
Uh oh.

2141
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:11,780
I think something bad is gonna happen when I do this.

2142
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:15,380
I have a feeling.

2143
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:26,980
It's a little bad.

2144
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:34,280
Okay, maybe we're okay.

2145
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:36,280
No, I think they're dead.

2146
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,200
Everybody is dead but me!

2147
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:42,840
Dear.

2148
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,960
Uh oh.

2149
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:53,380
Yeah, this does scream possibly, right?

2150
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,700
What?

2151
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:01,980
No!

2152
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:03,640
What?

2153
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:19,340
Dear.

2154
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:21,460
No, dear!

2155
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:24,940
Sir, I can't let you do that.

2156
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,280
There's no urgency.

2157
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:31,340
Maybe two or three max?

2158
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,500
Sir, I can't let you do that.

2159
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:38,060
More for me.

2160
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:39,260
Okay.

2161
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:43,740
Oh, okay, it would help if you hit...

2162
02:01:43,740 --> 02:01:44,660
Pick it back up?

2163
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:45,440
What do you mean?

2164
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:47,220
You spoke with such confidence!

2165
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,000
Oh my god!

2166
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,680
He didn't even land a single hit!

2167
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:12,120
He didn't land a single hit!

2168
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:13,540
He was so confident!

2169
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:15,600
We're humans!

2170
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:16,380
Oh, just kidding.

2171
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:18,960
Rescue team?

2172
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:22,060
Yeah!

2173
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,280
I don't have to play the game anymore!

2174
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:37,270
Yes sir!

2175
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:48,790
Captain Yatsumeda, sir.

2176
02:02:49,610 --> 02:02:51,790
The shuttle terminal has been destroyed.

2177
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:54,310
So we had to break through the ceiling.

2178
02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:56,490
That delayed our arrival.

2179
02:02:59,710 --> 02:03:01,370
It couldn't be helped.

2180
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:03,790
I mean...

2181
02:03:06,690 --> 02:03:10,750
I don't think anyone knew what was going to happen.

2182
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:13,630
Okay.

2183
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:15,430
Okay.

2184
02:03:16,590 --> 02:03:17,490
Yes sir.

2185
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:19,630
Wait, but my girlfriend...

2186
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:37,170
I also like how the butler's bow tie looks like candy.

2187
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:39,810
Sneaking suit.

2188
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:41,450
Oh my gosh, bodysuit!

2189
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:42,090
Oh!

2190
02:03:43,290 --> 02:03:43,770
Peek!

2191
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:46,450
Peek and look around the box.

2192
02:03:46,930 --> 02:03:48,650
Look around box.

2193
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:49,590
Check box.

2194
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:50,630
Search box.

2195
02:03:50,770 --> 02:03:51,510
Move box.

2196
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:52,610
Move box.

2197
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:53,450
Please!

2198
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:54,930
Please!

2199
02:03:56,350 --> 02:03:58,110
Walk out from box!

2200
02:03:59,270 --> 02:03:59,510
Rio!

2201
02:03:59,830 --> 02:04:00,090
Rio!

2202
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:00,990
Walk out from box.

2203
02:04:01,390 --> 02:04:02,050
Check box.

2204
02:04:02,170 --> 02:04:02,730
Move box.

2205
02:04:03,030 --> 02:04:03,610
Move box.

2206
02:04:03,730 --> 02:04:04,270
Move box.

2207
02:04:04,990 --> 02:04:06,290
Walk from box.

2208
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:14,010
Why was that scene so long for no reason?

2209
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:17,290
Just to tease me.

2210
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:22,370
Just a box.

2211
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:29,510
Oh yeah.

2212
02:04:30,690 --> 02:04:31,650
That's right.

2213
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:32,690
She has the important information.

2214
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:37,690
Okay.

2215
02:04:53,650 --> 02:04:55,050
Okay.

2216
02:04:58,810 --> 02:05:01,390
I'm saying okay.

2217
02:05:06,730 --> 02:05:07,430
Okay.

2218
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,470
Okay.

2219
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:20,130
Okay.

2220
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:22,310
Okay.

2221
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:23,090
I'm done.

2222
02:05:23,210 --> 02:05:23,430
I'm done.

2223
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:23,810
I'm done.

2224
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:33,970
Say yes ma'am.

2225
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:35,350
Yes ma'am.

2226
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:39,790
Naomi.

2227
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:48,750
Beg.

2228
02:05:51,490 --> 02:05:51,690
What?

2229
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:10,280
We are in the big leagues now.

2230
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:11,700
Wow.

2231
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:21,980
We were so robbed.

2232
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:26,460
That was the table where she kept saying no.

2233
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:26,760
Really?

2234
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,240
No way.

2235
02:06:33,010 --> 02:06:33,940
Her guns!

2236
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,120
Her guns are useless!

2237
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:37,480
We're under attack by some invincible alien!

2238
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,280
We are under attack by some...

2239
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:50,620
I'm not the biggest pervert here.

2240
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:54,480
We are under attack by some invincible monster.

2241
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,320
What is happening?

2242
02:06:55,580 --> 02:06:56,680
What is this camera angle?

2243
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:58,060
What is this supposed to mean?

2244
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,140
Is it a giant spider?

2245
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:04,660
Just use a flamethrower.

2246
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,360
No sir!

2247
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:30,840
But I'm an operator.

2248
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:34,780
Yeah.

2249
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:39,760
Yeah.

2250
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:44,860
Oh where the heck are we?

2251
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:46,060
Nice view!

2252
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:47,780
Oh my god!

2253
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:49,360
Wait this sneaking suit is genius!

2254
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:53,460
Do you see the panties with the cut out pants?

2255
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,920
Holy moly!

2256
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,340
Moly, moly, moly, moly.

2257
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:02,040
Control staff quarters.

2258
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:04,740
Run.

2259
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:10,240
Those were...wow!

2260
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:12,060
Okay.

2261
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,060
That was great!

2262
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:19,780
What a design!

2263
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,520
That's so good.

2264
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:24,020
Sexy.

2265
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:29,720
Uh oh.

2266
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:37,000
Zombies.

2267
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,300
The aliens are invisible though sometimes.

2268
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:43,460
Wow this is a really big room.

2269
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:45,680
Save point.

2270
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:49,780
There's candy!

2271
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:51,680
Oh wow!

2272
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,840
Oh no this room.

2273
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:54,240
Uh oh.

2274
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:55,180
What do you mean by that?

2275
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:58,180
What do you mean by that?

2276
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:01,100
That always scares me when you guys say things like that.

2277
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:06,180
Yay!

2278
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:08,400
Voice recognition average is...

2279
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:12,380
Yeah I was going to say our average used to be 9000 and now it's at 6000.

2280
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:21,240
Check table.

2281
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:27,200
Yup.

2282
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:31,460
I thought you have darn wigs and bathrobes.

2283
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:33,560
I feel like we spent most of the time today.

2284
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:34,520
Candy!

2285
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:36,220
Eat candy.

2286
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:40,020
No way.

2287
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:40,740
Oh!

2288
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,220
It's orange.

2289
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,180
Eat candy.

2290
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,060
Which flavor is this one?

2291
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:05,340
It's yellow.

2292
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:12,960
It's pretty sweet.

2293
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,020
It's yellow.

2294
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:16,200
Eat candy.

2295
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:21,440
Mint!

2296
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:23,380
Mint!

2297
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:28,700
Watermelon?

2298
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:32,580
Girl dinner?

2299
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:37,240
Candy jar.

2300
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,260
Eat green candy.

2301
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:46,200
Is she actually going to eat the green candy?

2302
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:48,620
Oh she's colorblind.

2303
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:53,220
Purple.

2304
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,480
Purple.

2305
02:10:57,900 --> 02:10:59,120
Great munching noises Minto.

2306
02:10:59,380 --> 02:10:59,800
Thank you.

2307
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:01,320
It's great.

2308
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:06,880
How should I say about... candy container.

2309
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:12,420
Ah...

2310
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:14,960
Jar.

2311
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:17,120
What?

2312
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:17,680
No!

2313
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:18,200
No!

2314
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:18,420
No!

2315
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:18,860
No!

2316
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:19,680
Stop!

2317
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:22,720
Who's Jonathan?

2318
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:29,420
Check table.

2319
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:32,440
Who's Jonathan?

2320
02:11:36,870 --> 02:11:37,890
Box maybe?

2321
02:11:37,890 --> 02:11:38,250
Maybe...

2322
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:42,810
Candy box.

2323
02:11:44,010 --> 02:11:45,470
She isn't real.

2324
02:11:45,550 --> 02:11:47,130
She likes watermelon candy.

2325
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:57,530
What's wrong with the watermelon candy?

2326
02:11:58,270 --> 02:11:59,730
Actually... oh my gosh.

2327
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:05,110
You guys know... if you know... if you have extra gum in your country.

2328
02:12:05,490 --> 02:12:08,130
You guys know the watermelon extra gum?

2329
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:10,970
Hold on.

2330
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:13,620
Let me make sure that's the right one.

2331
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:17,950
Yeah!

2332
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:25,810
Extra... the sweet watermelon is so good.

2333
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:31,230
If you can ever get the extra gum watermelon flavor.

2334
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:33,910
It's so yummy!

2335
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:35,710
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

2336
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:38,370
The lemonade one though?

2337
02:12:38,410 --> 02:12:39,470
I've never had that one.

2338
02:12:41,610 --> 02:12:41,930
Actually...

2339
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:43,370
Oh gosh.

2340
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:44,930
What do I say to this thing?

2341
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:45,850
Jar.

2342
02:12:47,870 --> 02:12:48,510
Okay.

2343
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:50,450
Stop.

2344
02:12:51,450 --> 02:12:52,670
What else is in here?

2345
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:53,670
Galley?

2346
02:12:54,330 --> 02:12:54,970
Galley.

2347
02:12:56,370 --> 02:12:57,590
What the hell is that?

2348
02:12:57,950 --> 02:12:58,650
Oh!

2349
02:13:01,510 --> 02:13:05,590
Check top shelf.

2350
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:13,410
And... look behind dinnerware.

2351
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:18,650
The jelly kind.

2352
02:13:22,170 --> 02:13:23,570
Yippee!

2353
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:24,610
Okay.

2354
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:28,170
Check second shelf.

2355
02:13:28,770 --> 02:13:29,330
The second floor?

2356
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:31,030
No, no.

2357
02:13:31,870 --> 02:13:32,010
Stop.

2358
02:13:33,490 --> 02:13:34,550
Galley.

2359
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:40,590
Why is it sparkling on the tissues?

2360
02:13:41,490 --> 02:13:42,470
Check tissues.

2361
02:13:45,110 --> 02:13:46,230
Yes there is.

2362
02:13:47,810 --> 02:13:48,550
It's right there.

2363
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:49,410
What is that?

2364
02:13:53,790 --> 02:13:54,830
Middle shelf.

2365
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:04,770
Sorry for overstepping my bounds.

2366
02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:08,870
Since I won't be able to tune in live, I just want to say for tomorrow.

2367
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:10,770
When in doubt, make more villagers.

2368
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:13,070
Thank you.

2369
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:14,110
Coffee bean.

2370
02:14:15,370 --> 02:14:16,410
Make coffee.

2371
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:19,450
I am.

2372
02:14:22,430 --> 02:14:24,330
Look next to juice.

2373
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:29,830
Okay, go next to juice.

2374
02:14:30,610 --> 02:14:31,250
Wax paper?

2375
02:14:31,670 --> 02:14:32,470
Wax paper.

2376
02:14:35,590 --> 02:14:36,310
Take it.

2377
02:14:36,670 --> 02:14:37,270
What's there?

2378
02:14:37,810 --> 02:14:38,570
Or is it a note?

2379
02:14:40,430 --> 02:14:41,590
Oh my gosh.

2380
02:14:49,450 --> 02:14:51,190
Check coffee pot.

2381
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:53,310
No.

2382
02:14:54,490 --> 02:14:55,990
Check coffee maker.

2383
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:01,210
Okay.

2384
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:02,590
Oh, that's it.

2385
02:15:03,010 --> 02:15:03,330
Okay.

2386
02:15:04,190 --> 02:15:06,030
Check bottom shelf.

2387
02:15:08,370 --> 02:15:10,670
We learned strafe, but she's so slow.

2388
02:15:12,450 --> 02:15:13,550
Eat it.

2389
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:14,190
Eat it.

2390
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:14,590
Eat it.

2391
02:15:14,730 --> 02:15:15,530
Eat...

2392
02:15:15,530 --> 02:15:17,010
Eat... oh wait.

2393
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:18,730
Eat donut.

2394
02:15:21,410 --> 02:15:22,610
Rio,

2395
02:15:27,010 --> 02:15:28,710
you need the calories right now.

2396
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:29,950
Eat ham.

2397
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:36,390
Eat cheese.

2398
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:40,590
Okay.

2399
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:42,890
She's so picky.

2400
02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:44,410
Eat bread.

2401
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:47,450
Oh my gosh.

2402
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:52,910
I think Rio is like...

2403
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:54,590
Actually insufferable.

2404
02:15:57,450 --> 02:15:58,930
Too crusty.

2405
02:15:59,210 --> 02:16:00,590
I don't like cheese.

2406
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:02,570
Too many calories.

2407
02:16:03,650 --> 02:16:04,530
No ham.

2408
02:16:05,010 --> 02:16:06,830
No time for ham.

2409
02:16:07,610 --> 02:16:08,730
Too crunchy.

2410
02:16:09,950 --> 02:16:11,670
I don't like cheese.

2411
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:13,590
More macaroni.

2412
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:17,130
She really is Goldilocks.

2413
02:16:17,210 --> 02:16:18,470
Oh my gosh, Rio.

2414
02:16:19,870 --> 02:16:20,270
Nothing.

2415
02:16:20,490 --> 02:16:21,510
You don't want anything.

2416
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:22,630
You're not thirsty.

2417
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:23,470
You're not hungry.

2418
02:16:23,930 --> 02:16:27,810
She would rather eat pure sugar off the table.

2419
02:16:28,610 --> 02:16:33,030
She would rather eat the candy from the table than a donut, which is actual calories.

2420
02:16:33,130 --> 02:16:36,930
I know it's sugar calories, but you're the one running around and fighting aliens.

2421
02:16:39,090 --> 02:16:39,630
Table.

2422
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:46,130
Girl dinner.

2423
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:48,190
Yeah, I saw someone say middle.

2424
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:49,650
Middle of table.

2425
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:51,790
Yes.

2426
02:16:52,530 --> 02:16:52,830
Yes.

2427
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:53,250
Yes.

2428
02:16:53,890 --> 02:16:55,190
It was a trick.

2429
02:16:55,870 --> 02:16:57,730
I think we gotta ditch this girl.

2430
02:16:57,910 --> 02:17:01,090
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think Naomi might be better.

2431
02:17:02,410 --> 02:17:05,930
We don't even know her, but...

2432
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:12,110
In a world where Naomi is better than any other character.

2433
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:18,070
A jar of candy.

2434
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:25,470
It's a big jar.

2435
02:17:27,270 --> 02:17:29,750
No, I don't mean Naomi Hunter.

2436
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:30,510
Don't get it twisted.

2437
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:31,310
No, no, no.

2438
02:17:31,410 --> 02:17:33,750
We have our girlfriend Naomi in this game, everybody.

2439
02:17:35,370 --> 02:17:36,830
Not Naomi Hunter.

2440
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:37,790
No, no, no.

2441
02:17:39,530 --> 02:17:40,070
Lockers.

2442
02:17:42,770 --> 02:17:46,230
I'm gonna lock her up in the lockers.

2443
02:17:51,470 --> 02:17:52,150
Mouth.

2444
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:54,130
Stomach.

2445
02:17:56,170 --> 02:17:56,650
Oh my god.

2446
02:17:56,730 --> 02:17:57,030
No!

2447
02:17:58,390 --> 02:17:59,010
Mouth.

2448
02:18:03,890 --> 02:18:04,530
Enemy three.

2449
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:06,270
Mouth.

2450
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:17,120
How is it that you miss every freaking shot?

2451
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:17,520
Run!

2452
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:21,280
Mouth.

2453
02:18:26,650 --> 02:18:27,090
Run!

2454
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:28,430
Run!

2455
02:18:29,830 --> 02:18:31,230
Run!

2456
02:18:31,890 --> 02:18:32,250
Run!

2457
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:34,350
Run!

2458
02:18:35,730 --> 02:18:36,190
Run!

2459
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:39,370
Enemy two.

2460
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:44,050
Enemy two.

2461
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:45,870
Run.

2462
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:50,280
Run.

2463
02:18:58,930 --> 02:19:00,230
Enemy two.

2464
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:02,130
Middle eye.

2465
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:12,800
Number two.

2466
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:14,640
Mouth.

2467
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:56,720
Head.

2468
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:17,340
Enemy two.

2469
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:19,200
Low kick.

2470
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:21,540
Low kick.

2471
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,080
If she would just hit.

2472
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:30,760
Auto fire.

2473
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:34,280
Mouth.

2474
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:36,980
Auto fire.

2475
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:42,480
Oh my god.

2476
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:43,540
Oh my god.

2477
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:44,080
Run.

2478
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:45,880
Run.

2479
02:20:47,380 --> 02:20:48,340
Run.

2480
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:51,600
Enemy one.

2481
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:53,180
Mouth.

2482
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,140
Auto fire.

2485
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:09,100
Oh my god.

2486
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:10,280
Auto fire.

2487
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:17,020
Stomach.

2488
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:18,480
Run.

2489
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:20,320
Oh my gosh.

2490
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:21,000
Oh my gosh.

2491
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:21,980
Oh my gosh.

2492
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:23,140
Run.

2493
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:23,200

2494
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:25,680
Run.

2495
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:57,560
Okay.

2496
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:11,360
Reload.

2497
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:14,800
This is so painful man.

2498
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:16,000
This is so painful.

2499
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:16,620
Run.

2500
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:20,720
Oh my god.

2501
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:21,920
Rio, please.

2502
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,260
You can't.

2503
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:25,540
You don't even aim.

2504
02:22:26,260 --> 02:22:26,840
Enemy two.

2505
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:28,500
Stomach.

2506
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:30,860
She is not close enough.

2507
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:32,360
Mouth.

2508
02:22:33,980 --> 02:22:34,460
Stomach.

2509
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:44,040

2510
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:45,660

2512
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:03,400

2519
02:23:30,730 --> 02:23:33,330
I'm playing musical pairs with this thing.

2520
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:34,270
Reload.

2521
02:23:36,650 --> 02:23:37,670
Straight.

2522
02:23:40,030 --> 02:23:40,910
That didn't do it.

2523
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:44,530
Move left.

2524
02:23:46,520 --> 02:23:47,410
Move left.

2525
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:05,130
Stomach.

2526
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:06,850
Stomach.

2527
02:24:08,270 --> 02:24:08,970
Auto fire.

2528
02:24:12,110 --> 02:24:13,130
Mouth.

2529
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:14,990
Auto fire.

2530
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:18,090
Stomach.

2531
02:24:21,350 --> 02:24:22,130
Stomach.

2532
02:24:23,490 --> 02:24:24,330
Auto fire.

2533
02:24:26,690 --> 02:24:27,470
Auto fire.

2534
02:24:30,470 --> 02:24:31,470
What do you mean no?

2535
02:24:31,570 --> 02:24:32,630
You need to hit it.

2536
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:34,050
Stomach.

2537
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:36,870
Auto fire.

2538
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:42,490
Right.

2539
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:47,370
Run.

2540
02:24:49,490 --> 02:24:50,890
No.

2541
02:24:51,510 --> 02:24:52,050
Stomach.

2542
02:24:53,530 --> 02:24:53,810
Okay.

2543
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:04,500
Save point.

2544
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,660
Save point.

2545
02:25:07,340 --> 02:25:09,520
Makes a lot of sense she can't aim.

2546
02:25:09,640 --> 02:25:11,740
That's a heckin O-I-C-W.

2547
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:12,620
She is hip firing.

2548
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:13,820
Thing weighs 20 pounds.

2549
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:16,940
Okay, but what about when she was using her pistol earlier?

2550
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:21,840
That doesn't...She was just as bad before.

2551
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:26,280
She was just as bad before.

2552
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:31,020
It takes talent to shoot a donut around the target.

2553
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:35,220
Oh my god.

2554
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:38,020
You would see her shoot and it would be like...

2555
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:42,600
And every single one would just circle around the dang worm.

2556
02:25:43,300 --> 02:25:44,140
Oh my gosh.

2557
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:45,240
Lockers.

2558
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:54,340
Run.

2559
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:03,620
Right locker.

2560
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:08,220
Wait, Jonathan.

2561
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:11,180
Left locker.

2562
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:16,460
I think I can open these, right?

2563
02:26:17,900 --> 02:26:19,060
Please enter the passcode.

2564
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:19,480
No!

2565
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:24,620
Can I do this one?

2566
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:25,180
Oh no.

2567
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:26,740
They both require...Okay.

2568
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:28,820
What else is in here?

2569
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:33,860
Shower room.

2570
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:47,600
There is a phone.

2571
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,500
Phone.

2572
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:50,920
Oops, I pressed the wrong button.

2573
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:51,480
Phone.

2574
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:54,220
Phone.

2575
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:55,940
No.

2576
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:56,540
No.

2577
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:57,000
No.

2578
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:57,400
Stop.

2579
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:57,960
Stop.

2580
02:26:58,340 --> 02:26:58,780
Stop.

2581
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:01,240
Shower room.

2582
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:07,440
That is a phone, right?

2583
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:09,040
That's not the shower, right?

2584
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:11,000
Shower head?

2585
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:19,080
I thought it was a phone.

2586
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:23,060
Bottle.

2587
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:28,080
Bottle.

2588
02:27:30,540 --> 02:27:31,140
Stop.

2589
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:32,140
Stop.

2590
02:27:33,300 --> 02:27:34,440
Shower room.

2591
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:37,920
Run.

2592
02:27:38,980 --> 02:27:39,580
Where are you going?

2593
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:40,180
Stop.

2594
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:42,460
Shower room.

2595
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:43,620
Shower room.

2596
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:45,720
Where was she going?

2597
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:46,920
She said shower room.

2598
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:47,600
Run.

2599
02:27:56,180 --> 02:27:56,900
Shampoo.

2600
02:28:02,510 --> 02:28:03,490
Stop.

2601
02:28:04,390 --> 02:28:06,470
Shower room.

2602
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:09,950
Shampoo.

2603
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:21,010
Soap!

2604
02:28:23,010 --> 02:28:24,910
That's not what I said.

2605
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:26,090
Shelf?

2606
02:28:26,290 --> 02:28:27,250
Shelf.

2607
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:33,590
Check bottle.

2608
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:39,390
Shower room.

2609
02:28:42,170 --> 02:28:44,510
It's a health pack.

2610
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:49,510
Check behind bottle.

2611
02:28:52,610 --> 02:28:53,030
Stop.

2612
02:28:53,370 --> 02:28:53,610
Stop.

2613
02:28:54,610 --> 02:28:55,330
Shower room.

2614
02:28:58,070 --> 02:28:59,190
Where is she going?

2615
02:28:59,590 --> 02:29:00,550
I'm so curious.

2616
02:29:00,550 --> 02:29:01,110
Run.

2617
02:29:01,650 --> 02:29:03,270
Where is she going?

2618
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:04,290
What shower room...oh.

2619
02:29:14,110 --> 02:29:15,750
Rio...Zoolander over here?

2620
02:29:17,430 --> 02:29:18,930
Shower room.

2621
02:29:21,510 --> 02:29:22,030
Run.

2622
02:29:25,230 --> 02:29:29,670
I want the health.

2623
02:29:32,110 --> 02:29:34,530
I feel like I'm fighting with this game most of the time.

2624
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:44,040
Shampoo.

2625
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:45,040
I tried that.

2626
02:29:46,420 --> 02:29:46,940
Shampoo.

2627
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Oh it worked.

2628
02:29:50,100 --> 02:29:50,440
Oh my gosh.

2629
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:50,940
Thank goodness.

2630
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,340
I tried shampoo and it said...

2631
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:57,660
She said Jonathan's room.

2632
02:29:59,060 --> 02:30:00,860
Is that a washing machine in here?

2633
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:01,400
That's weird.

2634
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:04,800
Ah...

2635
02:30:07,660 --> 02:30:08,700
Storage area.

2636
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,540
This is a real fighting game.

2637
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:17,780
Can you imagine a fighting game where you actually have to do this?

2638
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:21,120
It's just like X, Y, Z, Z, X, Y, X...

2639
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:23,960
Are you kidding me?

2640
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:25,740
Run.

2641
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:31,410
Mouth.

2642
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:03,280
Auto fire.

2643
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:04,780
Hey.

2644
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:39,370
Run away.

2645
02:31:42,790 --> 02:31:44,410
Do I have to shoot them in order?

2646
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:45,510
That's what I'm trying to do.

2647
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:49,270
I'm trying to shoot them like 1, 2, 3, you know?

2648
02:31:49,730 --> 02:31:50,170
Escape?

2649
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:52,250
Run.

2650
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:56,690
Run away.

2651
02:31:58,110 --> 02:31:58,930
Run left.

2652
02:32:01,530 --> 02:32:02,010
Run.

2653
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:02,070
Run.

2654
02:32:02,610 --> 02:32:04,130
Oh my god.

2655
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:05,170
Strength.

2656
02:32:06,010 --> 02:32:07,930
This is what strength does you guys.

2657
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:10,510
You guys have told me to do it the last time and that's what it did.

2658
02:32:11,210 --> 02:32:12,030
Run away.

2659
02:32:14,830 --> 02:32:16,490
Oh from what you're targeting.

2660
02:32:17,310 --> 02:32:17,850
4, 5, 6.

2661
02:32:18,510 --> 02:32:19,170
Enemy 3.

2662
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:20,770
Run.

2663
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:24,070
I thought it just meant run in general.

2664
02:32:24,850 --> 02:32:25,890
Enemy 1.

2665
02:32:26,890 --> 02:32:27,410
Mouth.

2666
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:29,310
Mouth.

2667
02:32:35,050 --> 02:32:36,330
Mouth.

2668
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:43,830
Auto fire.

2669
02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:17,530
Ok.

2670
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:18,390
Auto fire.

2671
02:33:20,190 --> 02:33:20,750
Ok.

2672
02:33:21,490 --> 02:33:22,190
Mouth.

2673
02:33:23,290 --> 02:33:24,070
Ok.

2674
02:33:24,890 --> 02:33:26,170
Girl!

2675
02:33:26,770 --> 02:33:27,110
Girl!

2676
02:33:27,790 --> 02:33:29,530
Move right.

2677
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:32,550
Move right...oh move left.

2678
02:33:35,090 --> 02:33:35,730
Walk.

2679
02:33:38,190 --> 02:33:39,310
Enemy 3.

2680
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:43,940
Aim.

2681
02:33:49,780 --> 02:33:50,480
Oh my god.

2682
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:50,920
Thank you.

2683
02:33:51,020 --> 02:33:51,680
Oh my god.

2684
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:54,920
Move right.

2685
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:56,860
Ok.

2686
02:33:56,940 --> 02:33:57,580
Nice, nice, nice.

2687
02:33:57,860 --> 02:33:58,560
Move right.

2688
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:00,540
Move right.

2689
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:07,240
Move right.

2690
02:34:11,900 --> 02:34:12,980
Move right.

2691
02:34:47,770 --> 02:34:48,990
Save point.

2692
02:34:50,490 --> 02:34:51,130
Run.

2693
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:54,570
Oh wait, actually...

2694
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:59,350
I was going to heal, but we'll finish.

2695
02:35:00,230 --> 02:35:02,590
Oh my god.

2696
02:35:04,350 --> 02:35:06,290
Oh my god.

2697
02:35:06,790 --> 02:35:09,370
I literally was banging my head on my microphone.

2698
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:10,010
Oh my god.

2699
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:19,620
The fact that she just runs when I try to get her into position.

2700
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:23,960
Yeah, you sit there and contemplate your actions Rio.

2701
02:35:25,700 --> 02:35:26,180
Oh yeah.

2702
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:27,600
Storage area.

2703
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:31,220
Run.

2704
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:34,520
What's here?

2705
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:35,920
Candy.

2706
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:36,980
Oh a note.

2707
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:38,320
Read note.

2708
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:38,900
Clean.

2709
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:41,300
This isn't the right time.

2710
02:35:45,130 --> 02:35:46,850
Read note.

2711
02:35:47,250 --> 02:35:47,650
Clean.

2712
02:35:48,330 --> 02:35:49,910
This isn't the right time.

2713
02:35:51,510 --> 02:35:52,410
Box.

2714
02:35:54,910 --> 02:35:55,650
Cardboard box?

2715
02:35:56,550 --> 02:35:57,710
Which one do you mean?

2716
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:04,960
Check topped cardboard...

2717
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:06,900
What should I check?

2718
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:07,320
Sorry.

2719
02:36:09,220 --> 02:36:11,480
Check candy box.

2720
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:15,380
This says fruit flavored candy on it.

2721
02:36:15,380 --> 02:36:17,220
This didn't come from the hotel.

2722
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:19,480
Yet there's so much of it.

2723
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:23,520
Open candy box.

2724
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:26,080
It's a cardboard box full of candies.

2725
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:26,700
Ok.

2726
02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:29,460
No shower time?

2727
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:30,720
I mean we can go back in.

2728
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:33,460
Check hotel box.

2729
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:35,060
Are you talking about this?

2730
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:39,580
Check invoice.

2731
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:41,700
It's an invoice addressed to Jonathan.

2732
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:43,060
Jonathan?

2733
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:43,460
Wow.

2734
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:46,700
He ordered an amazing amount of fruit candies.

2735
02:36:46,980 --> 02:36:47,980
He loves candy.

2736
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:51,540
Wait.

2737
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:52,580
Can I read it?

2738
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:52,720
Oh.

2739
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:59,580
For Mr. Jonathan Turner, please remit payment for the 20 cases of fruit candy that you had ordered.

2740
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:02,640
Read invoice.

2741
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:04,540
It's an invoice addressed to Jonathan.

2742
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:07,780
Check vacuum.

2743
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:09,560
Are you talking about this?

2744
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:12,800
Check vacuum cleaner.

2745
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:14,620
It's the hotel's vacuum cleaner.

2746
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:17,220
It's really useful for cleaning.

2747
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:21,880
Use vacuum cleaner.

2748
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:23,140
You want me to clean?

2749
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:24,440
Huh.

2750
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:25,440
A neat freak.

2751
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:28,860
Not too cool considering what's going on around us.

2752
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:30,480
What do you mean not too cool?

2753
02:37:35,140 --> 02:37:36,960
Open bright box.

2754
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:39,560
There are cardboard boxes everywhere.

2755
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:41,880
Can you be a little more specific?

2756
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:47,960
Check right box.

2757
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:50,460
There are cardboard boxes everywhere.

2758
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:52,840
Can you be a little more specific?

2759
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:55,640
I don't understand how this is important.

2760
02:37:55,860 --> 02:37:56,600
Maybe the 20?

2761
02:38:02,170 --> 02:38:03,250
Check the invoice.

2762
02:38:03,370 --> 02:38:03,690
I did.

2763
02:38:04,230 --> 02:38:04,850
I read it.

2764
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:06,290
I already did.

2765
02:38:07,290 --> 02:38:08,170
Write most.

2766
02:38:08,730 --> 02:38:09,930
Oh yeah, maybe color.

2767
02:38:10,450 --> 02:38:11,530
Try... wait.

2768
02:38:12,890 --> 02:38:14,150
No, no, no.

2769
02:38:14,550 --> 02:38:15,170
No, no, no.

2770
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:16,050
Stop.

2771
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:18,410
Storage...

2772
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:22,290
Storage area.

2773
02:38:23,350 --> 02:38:25,990
I keep wanting to say box.

2774
02:38:27,850 --> 02:38:29,250
Shoot box?

2775
02:38:29,670 --> 02:38:30,630
Shoot box.

2776
02:38:33,790 --> 02:38:35,050
Storage area.

2777
02:38:36,370 --> 02:38:37,010
Okay.

2778
02:38:42,450 --> 02:38:44,110
Check white box.

2779
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:46,490
This cardboard box contains hotel supplies.

2780
02:38:46,630 --> 02:38:47,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2781
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:50,370
I guess they are storing it here temporarily in the staff quarters.

2782
02:38:50,650 --> 02:38:50,970
Okay.

2783
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:53,270
Open white box.

2784
02:38:53,630 --> 02:38:55,510
It's a cardboard box that contains supplies.

2785
02:38:57,050 --> 02:38:58,750
Check brown box.

2786
02:38:59,570 --> 02:39:02,130
This is a cardboard box containing office supplies.

2787
02:39:02,590 --> 02:39:03,250
Office supplies.

2788
02:39:03,310 --> 02:39:04,730
Stuff like pens and paper.

2789
02:39:05,690 --> 02:39:06,950
It has nothing to do with us.

2790
02:39:07,690 --> 02:39:08,150
Oh.

2791
02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:09,630
Okay.

2792
02:39:15,400 --> 02:39:16,740
She has x-ray vision.

2793
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:17,080
Truly.

2794
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:18,660
Alright.

2795
02:39:19,380 --> 02:39:20,840
Second floor.

2796
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:24,940
Hide in box.

2797
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:25,660
Run.

2798
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:27,700
Yes.

2799
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,560
What's this?

2800
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:38,800
Oh!

2801
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:40,060
Jonathan's room!

2802
02:39:40,860 --> 02:39:41,520
Balcony.

2803
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:45,200
Why is she just running around in circles?

2804
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:49,040
Trash can.

2805
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:50,860
It's just a trash can.

2806
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:52,900
There's nothing strange about it.

2807
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:55,600
Check trash can.

2808
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:57,040
It's just a trash can.

2809
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:59,080
Search trash can.

2810
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:00,540
It's just a trash can.

2811
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:02,440
Plant.

2812
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:04,920
It's an ordinary house plant.

2813
02:40:05,620 --> 02:40:08,420
But all the plants in the station are often studied to obtain data.

2814
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:11,120
Search plant.

2815
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:12,900
It's an ordinary house plant.

2816
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:16,380
But all the plants in the station are often studied to obtain data.

2817
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:19,340
Check under couch.

2818
02:40:19,700 --> 02:40:20,280
Under the bench?

2819
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:21,860
Bench.

2820
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:23,440
Sure.

2821
02:40:23,740 --> 02:40:26,280
What could it be?

2822
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:27,600
These are the codes!

2823
02:40:27,940 --> 02:40:28,500
That thing.

2824
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:29,480
That thing.

2825
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:30,720
Yes.

2826
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:32,420
Pick it up.

2827
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:33,960
There's a formula written on this.

2828
02:40:34,060 --> 02:40:34,660
A formula?

2829
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:36,520
It might be useful for something.

2830
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:37,720
I'll take it.

2831
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:39,640
Okay.

2832
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:41,060
A formula.

2833
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:43,340
A formula?

2834
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:45,440
A formula.

2835
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:48,320
What?

2836
02:40:49,440 --> 02:40:51,640
Alan's reference kit?

2837
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:52,740
No.

2838
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:55,020
Scientific document?

2839
02:40:56,080 --> 02:40:59,080
Document filled with scientific formulas.

2840
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:01,160
What kind of... are we...

2841
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:03,320
That's so vague.

2842
02:41:04,340 --> 02:41:05,980
That's so vague.

2843
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:07,940
Is it like...

2844
02:41:07,940 --> 02:41:10,680
Like mixing a potion formula?

2845
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:13,940
She is so...

2846
02:41:15,940 --> 02:41:17,060
Jonathan's room.

2847
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:20,300
Yes.

2848
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:22,940
Is Jonathan in there?

2849
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:24,200
Jonathan?

2850
02:41:30,040 --> 02:41:32,600
Voice lock?

2851
02:41:32,660 --> 02:41:33,320
What do I say?

2852
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:42,340
This is a message for Jonathan Turner.

2853
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:43,760
Jonathan T.

2854
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:46,180
Hi, I'm Jonathan, and this is my room.

2855
02:41:46,380 --> 02:41:51,260
I don't know who you are, but if you want to enter my room, you have to answer this question.

2856
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:54,860
You see, there's something that I've been secretly collecting.

2857
02:41:55,320 --> 02:41:55,800
Secretly?

2858
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:57,060
Okay, are you ready?

2859
02:41:57,580 --> 02:41:58,780
Speak your answer into the mic.

2860
02:41:59,420 --> 02:42:00,680
Something that he's collecting.

2861
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:02,540
What's he talking about?

2862
02:42:03,400 --> 02:42:04,580
I'll defer to you.

2863
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:05,720
Why me?

2864
02:42:06,580 --> 02:42:07,540
Fruit candy.

2865
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:09,580
Maybe it was a bit too tough.

2866
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:10,120
What?

2867
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:10,960
A hint, huh?

2868
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:12,060
Food.

2869
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:14,820
I'm not going to tell you anymore.

2870
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:15,980
Candy.

2871
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:18,820
I don't have the slightest idea.

2872
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:19,840
Let me do it.

2873
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:21,960
Maybe there are hints to be found in this room.

2874
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:23,500
Rio is so slow.

2875
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:27,020
Rio, Rio, Rio, Rio.

2876
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:33,020
This is a message for Jonathan Turner.

2877
02:42:33,180 --> 02:42:34,600
Hey guys, I'm Jonathan.

2878
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:36,660
Can you identify what I collect?

2879
02:42:36,660 --> 02:42:38,260
Do you want to get into my room?

2880
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:39,260
Are you ready?

2881
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:40,460
Say your answer into the mic.

2882
02:42:40,700 --> 02:42:41,100
Okay.

2883
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:43,480
He said he was collecting something you eat.

2884
02:42:44,660 --> 02:42:45,620
Think about it.

2885
02:42:45,820 --> 02:42:46,520
I know.

2886
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:47,980
Candy.

2887
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:49,900
Maybe it was a bit too tough.

2888
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:51,440
A hint, huh?

2889
02:42:51,560 --> 02:42:52,200
What do I say?

2890
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:52,580
Food.

2891
02:42:53,780 --> 02:42:55,300
I'm not going to tell you anymore.

2892
02:42:57,380 --> 02:42:59,220
I don't have the slightest idea.

2893
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:02,580
Maybe there are hints to be found in this room.

2894
02:43:02,580 --> 02:43:05,780
I said fruit candy the first time, you guys.

2895
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,040
I'll try it again.

2896
02:43:10,340 --> 02:43:13,100
This is a message for Jonathan Turner.

2897
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:16,560
Can you identify what I collect?

2898
02:43:16,580 --> 02:43:17,460
I'll watch the rest in archive.

2899
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:17,960
Thanks for the fun.

2900
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:18,800
Thank you.

2901
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:20,480
Say your answer into the mic.

2902
02:43:20,820 --> 02:43:21,760
Thank you.

2903
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:23,520
He said he was collecting something you eat.

2904
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:25,620
Think about it.

2905
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:27,400
What's Richard's?

2906
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:31,900
Is that like a type of fruit candy?

2907
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:34,060
Fruit candy.

2908
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:36,120
Maybe it was a bit too tough.

2909
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:37,500
A hint, huh?

2910
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:38,540
Food.

2911
02:43:39,900 --> 02:43:41,380
I'm not going to tell you anymore.

2912
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:45,260
I don't have the slightest idea.

2913
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:48,620
Maybe there are hints to be found in this room.

2914
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:59,240
This is a message for Jonathan Turner.

2915
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:02,920
Can you identify what I collect?

2916
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:04,760
Are you ready?

2917
02:44:05,160 --> 02:44:06,700
Say your answer into the mic.

2918
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:09,740
He said he was collecting something you eat.

2919
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:12,020
Think about it.

2920
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:14,480
Fruit candy.

2921
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:16,980
Maybe it was a bit too tough.

2922
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:18,400
A hint, huh?

2923
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:19,420
Food.

2924
02:44:20,380 --> 02:44:22,200
I'm not going to tell you anymore.

2925
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:26,240
I don't have the slightest idea.

2926
02:44:27,180 --> 02:44:29,520
Maybe there are hints to be found in this room.

2927
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:31,160
I'm going to Gustav's room.

2928
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:33,380
Gustav's room.

2929
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:35,100
What?

2930
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:38,140
Gustav's room.

2931
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:42,960
I don't know.

2932
02:44:43,320 --> 02:44:44,120
I don't know.

2933
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:46,560
Fruit candy.

2934
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:52,240
Oh no!

2935
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:54,140
Disengage the lock.

2936
02:44:54,640 --> 02:44:57,260
Read note.

2937
02:44:57,720 --> 02:44:58,220
Leave the room?

2938
02:44:58,420 --> 02:44:58,580
No!

2939
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:02,960
Yes.

2940
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:04,560
Gustav's room.

2941
02:45:04,900 --> 02:45:05,500
Leave the room?

2942
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:05,880
No!

2943
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:07,040
Gustav's room.

2944
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:07,400
No!

2945
02:45:14,890 --> 02:45:15,810
Gustav's room.

2946
02:45:17,170 --> 02:45:18,230
Gustav's room.

2947
02:45:18,530 --> 02:45:19,270
Jonathan's room.

2948
02:45:24,950 --> 02:45:25,610
I'm going...

2949
02:45:25,610 --> 02:45:27,810
I'm going mental here, you guys.

2950
02:45:28,410 --> 02:45:29,230
I can't do this.

2951
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:36,380
Gustav's room.

2952
02:45:38,360 --> 02:45:40,660
Where did you hear balcony?

2953
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:43,720
I keep losing Wi-Fi.

2954
02:45:43,820 --> 02:45:48,880
What happened for the AI to say his viewers are reacting to a streamer named Jonathan in interaction with his chat?

2955
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:51,780
Specifically collecting fruit flavored candy.

2956
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:51,900
Fruit candy.

2957
02:45:52,040 --> 02:45:58,000
What kind of food is not out in the open?

2958
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:01,600
But he has an invoice of fruit candy.

2959
02:46:04,640 --> 02:46:06,280
There was so much food.

2960
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:07,260
There was ham.

2961
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:08,840
There was donuts.

2962
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:10,200
He doesn't collect that.

2963
02:46:10,740 --> 02:46:12,660
Imagine being a speedrunner for this game.

2964
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:17,280
I think if you're a speedrunner, you have to use like a text-to-speech, you know?

2965
02:46:18,800 --> 02:46:21,060
You have to use text-to-speech.

2966
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:26,740
This has to be the worst idea for video game controls.

2967
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:27,100
No!

2968
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:29,120
Peter, welcome to membership!

2969
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:34,020
Did you try saying fruit flavored candy?

2970
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:34,860
Let's try that.

2971
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:35,980
Jonathan's room.

2972
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:40,960
You have a soundboard?

2973
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:42,680
Maybe, yeah.

2974
02:46:47,020 --> 02:46:48,440
Fruit flavored candy.

2975
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:49,160
Let's try that.

2976
02:46:52,900 --> 02:46:55,640
This is a message for Jonathan Turner.

2977
02:46:57,420 --> 02:46:59,220
Can you identify what I collect?

2978
02:46:59,380 --> 02:47:01,200
That is a task at that point.

2979
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:02,960
Say your answer into the mic.

2980
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:03,240
Okay.

2981
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:06,020
He said he was collecting something you eat.

2982
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:06,420
Okay.

2983
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:08,280
Think about it.

2984
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:11,080
Fruit flavored candy.

2985
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:13,120
Maybe it was a bit too tough.

2986
02:47:13,900 --> 02:47:14,540
A hint, huh?

2987
02:47:15,220 --> 02:47:15,580
Food.

2988
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:18,340
I'm not going to tell you anymore.

2989
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:20,220
Um...

2990
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:22,420
I don't have the slightest idea.

2991
02:47:23,620 --> 02:47:25,640
Maybe there are hints to be found in this room.

2992
02:47:36,100 --> 02:47:37,920
I did try just candy.

2993
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:42,080
Uh...

2994
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:44,440
I don't think my volume...

2995
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:45,140
I don't actually...

2996
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:46,140
Can I fix my...

2997
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:49,100
I don't think there's a way to fix my volume...

2998
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:52,040
If it's low.

2999
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:55,960
Like, there's no options.

3000
02:47:58,900 --> 02:48:01,180
I guess you're stumped too, Operator.

3001
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:08,720
Gustav's room.

3002
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:09,760
The balcony.

3003
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:10,760
Okay.

3004
02:48:13,320 --> 02:48:14,440
Gustav's room.

3005
02:48:14,900 --> 02:48:15,260
Yes.

3006
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:17,980
Gustav's room.

3007
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:19,220
I am stopped.

3008
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:21,260
Gustav's room.

3009
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:22,520
I am stopped.

3010
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:23,820
Gustav's room.

3011
02:48:24,140 --> 02:48:24,600
The balcony.

3012
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:27,960
Gustav...Gustav's room!

3013
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:28,960
Leave the room?

3014
02:48:31,300 --> 02:48:31,860
Stop!

3015
02:48:32,220 --> 02:48:32,680
Stop!

3016
02:48:32,860 --> 02:48:33,140
Stop!

3017
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:38,060
And then she tries to be cheeky with me.

3018
02:48:38,180 --> 02:48:39,240
I can't with this woman!

3019
02:48:48,350 --> 02:48:51,450
There's a reason she told you what flavor each piece was.

3020
02:48:58,730 --> 02:48:59,290
Gustav!

3021
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:01,350
Yes?

3022
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:04,510
Where are you going?

3023
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:05,510
Where are you going?

3024
02:49:05,710 --> 02:49:06,610
Where are you going?

3025
02:49:09,210 --> 02:49:10,390
Where is she going?

3026
02:49:11,050 --> 02:49:11,670
Where is she going?

3027
02:49:12,310 --> 02:49:13,510
I'm just...

3028
02:49:14,290 --> 02:49:15,530
I guess we'll see.

3029
02:49:15,730 --> 02:49:16,630
Where is she going?

3030
02:49:17,070 --> 02:49:18,470
Where is she going?

3031
02:49:21,090 --> 02:49:22,550
We're letting her cook.

3032
02:49:23,350 --> 02:49:25,410
Rio has obtained sentience.

3033
02:49:25,590 --> 02:49:26,670
Never...Oh, nevermind.

3034
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:28,630
I spoke too soon.

3035
02:49:36,430 --> 02:49:38,050
Control staff quarters.

3036
02:49:41,370 --> 02:49:42,010
Yes.

3037
02:49:43,550 --> 02:49:43,890
Okay.

3038
02:49:45,570 --> 02:49:45,970
Okay.

3039
02:49:51,100 --> 02:49:52,400
I'm gonna not say...

3040
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:58,390
I'm not gonna say room because she keeps thinking I say leave room, I think.

3041
02:49:59,010 --> 02:49:59,370
You know?

3042
02:50:00,050 --> 02:50:00,650
Gustav.

3043
02:50:01,350 --> 02:50:02,170
Gustav!

3044
02:50:03,870 --> 02:50:04,690
Gustav!

3045
02:50:06,150 --> 02:50:06,560
Gustav.

3046
02:50:08,350 --> 02:50:08,760
Gustav.

3047
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:12,040
Oh my god!

3048
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:15,920
Run.

3049
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:17,300
Yes.

3050
02:50:29,340 --> 02:50:30,920
Disengage the lock.

3051
02:50:31,640 --> 02:50:33,320
Oh, you'll read that note first.

3052
02:50:34,620 --> 02:50:35,390
Check note.

3053
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:36,660
The balcony.

3054
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:37,620
Okay.

3055
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:39,460
No, please.

3056
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:40,380
Stop.

3057
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:41,140
Yes.

3058
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:43,140
Gustav.

3059
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:44,240
I am stopped.

3060
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:45,520
Gustav.

3061
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:46,480
I am stopped.

3062
02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:47,940
Gustav.

3063
02:50:48,060 --> 02:50:48,960
I am stopped.

3064
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:55,560
Gustav.

3065
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:56,520
I am stopped.

3066
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:01,100
Gustav.

3067
02:51:01,360 --> 02:51:02,360
I am stopped.

3068
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:04,580
Gustav.

3069
02:51:04,780 --> 02:51:05,540
I am stopped.

3070
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:18,480
Gustav.

3071
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:25,340
Why would they name him this?

3072
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:32,580
Why couldn't he be like Jeremy or something?

3073
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:43,520
Why couldn't he be like David, Blake...

3074
02:51:47,080 --> 02:51:48,100
Henry!

3075
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:06,510
Hold on, Rio.

3076
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:09,690
Mommy is having a mental break, please.

3077
02:52:20,810 --> 02:52:22,590
I need a sip.

3078
02:52:27,430 --> 02:52:28,050
Shut up!

3079
02:52:28,530 --> 02:52:30,790
Actually, what was I going to do?

3080
02:52:30,790 --> 02:52:32,330
Oh, she sells.

3081
02:52:36,710 --> 02:52:39,010
I really don't, but I will.

3082
02:52:40,590 --> 02:52:41,310
Yes.

3083
02:52:44,570 --> 02:52:44,930
Okay.

3084
02:52:53,450 --> 02:52:57,470
Around the rugged rocks, the ragged rascal ran.

3085
02:52:57,470 --> 02:52:58,430
Awesome.

3086
02:52:58,770 --> 02:52:59,370
Awesome.

3087
02:53:00,710 --> 02:53:01,590
Awesome.

3088
02:53:02,050 --> 02:53:02,190
Okay.

3089
02:53:07,110 --> 02:53:09,910
Did I get this one wrong before?

3090
02:53:10,910 --> 02:53:17,370
A noise annoys an oyster, but a noisy noise annoys an oyster more.

3091
02:53:19,330 --> 02:53:22,190
Thanks, baby!

3092
02:53:22,190 --> 02:53:24,550
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

3093
02:53:24,670 --> 02:53:27,290
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

3094
02:53:27,650 --> 02:53:31,790
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

3095
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:34,270
Okay, your turn.

3096
02:53:35,510 --> 02:53:37,810
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

3097
02:53:38,130 --> 02:53:40,590
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

3098
02:53:40,950 --> 02:53:45,810
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

3099
02:53:46,270 --> 02:53:46,750
Awesome.

3100
02:53:46,750 --> 02:53:48,250
Yeah, Brandon!

3101
02:53:48,510 --> 02:53:49,350
Thanks for the vibe, Ethan.

3102
02:53:54,550 --> 02:53:56,850
I need you to listen to me, Brio.

3103
02:53:57,190 --> 02:53:58,850
I really need you to listen to me.

3104
02:54:06,030 --> 02:54:06,970
Gustav's room.

3105
02:54:23,230 --> 02:54:24,190
I can't...

3106
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:29,650
Strawberry candy?

3107
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:30,870
Okay.

3108
02:54:40,550 --> 02:54:43,170
Strawberry candy.

3109
02:54:46,210 --> 02:54:47,610
Okay!

3110
02:54:48,270 --> 02:54:54,330
Thank you for your backstaging, everybody.

3111
02:54:55,330 --> 02:54:57,710
Inappropriate time to...

3112
02:54:57,710 --> 02:55:04,010
Oh my god!

3113
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:08,050
Why does he collect these?

3114
02:55:10,570 --> 02:55:11,570
What?

3115
02:55:12,530 --> 02:55:13,050
Bottle.

3116
02:55:14,830 --> 02:55:15,810
It looks like pills.

3117
02:55:15,930 --> 02:55:16,530
Pills here.

3118
02:55:17,170 --> 02:55:17,790
Is he okay?

3119
02:55:18,530 --> 02:55:19,590
Jar of candy.

3120
02:55:28,850 --> 02:55:30,290
The slow...

3121
02:55:30,290 --> 02:55:32,450
Is that why there were no pink ones?

3122
02:55:32,750 --> 02:55:33,890
I didn't notice that.

3123
02:55:35,270 --> 02:55:36,030
Eat candy.

3124
02:55:48,690 --> 02:55:50,130
Check computer.

3125
02:55:52,110 --> 02:55:52,890
Control staff only.

3126
02:55:53,870 --> 02:55:55,590
The registry's top page is displayed.

3127
02:55:57,950 --> 02:55:59,230

3128
02:56:00,610 --> 02:56:02,370

3130
02:56:06,590 --> 02:56:09,610
Adds night vision mode to standard monitor cameras.

3131
02:56:10,970 --> 02:56:13,030
Can I do that?

3132
02:56:15,110 --> 02:56:17,070
Security camera upgrade feature.

3133
02:56:17,810 --> 02:56:18,550
Why?

3134
02:56:20,550 --> 02:56:22,130
Oh, I have to download this.

3135
02:56:22,530 --> 02:56:23,250
Let's see.

3136
02:56:23,450 --> 02:56:24,610
Oh, I have to do work.

3137
02:56:24,850 --> 02:56:25,130
Sorry.

3138
02:56:25,530 --> 02:56:26,730
This should work without much fuss.

3139
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:30,390
I'm so used to someone else telling me what to do.

3140
02:56:30,470 --> 02:56:31,670
I'm turning my brain off.

3141
02:56:33,650 --> 02:56:34,150
Alright!

3142
02:56:34,550 --> 02:56:34,710
Yay!

3143
02:56:34,790 --> 02:56:35,490
We got an upgrade!

3144
02:56:38,590 --> 02:56:39,090

Install the latest generation of infrared monitor systems to see clearly under zero light conditions.

3147
02:56:48,590 --> 02:56:50,150
Do you think she'll also understand me better?

3148
02:56:57,950 --> 02:57:00,170
Is there anything in here?

3149
02:57:01,410 --> 02:57:02,150
Card.

3150
02:57:04,090 --> 02:57:05,570
Yellow card.

3151
02:57:07,150 --> 02:57:08,450
Yes ma'am.

3152
02:57:09,370 --> 02:57:10,530
What is that?

3153
02:57:12,110 --> 02:57:12,770
Oh shoot.

3154
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:13,930
Yellow card.

3155
02:57:15,630 --> 02:57:15,930
Yeah.

3156
02:57:17,290 --> 02:57:17,990
What is that?

3157
02:57:18,030 --> 02:57:18,530
ID card?

3158
02:57:19,990 --> 02:57:21,250
Take ID card.

3159
02:57:27,870 --> 02:57:28,970
But he's dead.

3160
02:57:29,310 --> 02:57:30,210
Oh, no he's not.

3161
02:57:32,710 --> 02:57:33,310
Bed.

3162
02:57:35,490 --> 02:57:36,050
Oh wow.

3163
02:57:37,650 --> 02:57:39,870
It's the one time she doesn't want to go to the bed.

3164
02:57:40,410 --> 02:57:41,070
Alright guys.

3165
02:57:42,070 --> 02:57:43,310
Leave room.

3166
02:57:44,810 --> 02:57:45,390
Yes.

3167
02:57:46,690 --> 02:57:47,090
Okay.

3168
02:57:48,950 --> 02:57:49,950
Gustav.

3169
02:57:55,170 --> 02:57:56,210
Guys,

3170
02:57:59,240 --> 02:58:01,300
I don't know how to do this.

3171
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:05,140
I don't know how to do this.

3172
02:58:05,300 --> 02:58:06,660
I don't know how.

3173
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:10,160
Gustav.

3174
02:58:17,950 --> 02:58:18,650
Gustav.

3175
02:58:21,950 --> 02:58:22,650
Gustav.

3176
02:58:23,690 --> 02:58:24,390
Gustav.

3177
02:58:34,460 --> 02:58:35,780
Just let her go.

3178
02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:38,620
If she loves you, she'll come back.

3179
02:58:39,320 --> 02:58:40,180
Take a shower.

3180
02:58:47,860 --> 02:58:48,000
Yes.

3181
02:58:51,780 --> 02:58:53,440
Why do you remember that Rio?

3182
02:58:54,040 --> 02:58:55,280
Why do you remember that?

3183
02:59:01,880 --> 02:59:02,920
Walk forward.

3184
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:03,620
Walk right.

3185
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:04,300
Check room.

3186
02:59:04,460 --> 02:59:05,460
Okay, we'll try that.

3187
02:59:06,260 --> 02:59:07,240
Second floor.

3188
02:59:09,680 --> 02:59:10,620
We'll try it.

3189
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:11,220
We'll try it.

3190
02:59:11,280 --> 02:59:12,140
Actually, hold on.

3191
02:59:12,480 --> 02:59:13,320
Save panel.

3192
02:59:14,100 --> 02:59:14,920
Save point.

3193
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:17,080
Yeah, yeah.

3194
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:17,460
Run.

3195
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:18,560
What?

3196
02:59:20,720 --> 02:59:22,460
Save point.

3197
02:59:22,780 --> 02:59:22,960
Run.

3198
02:59:24,620 --> 02:59:28,040
Since we got to Jonathan's room, let's save real quick.

3199
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:35,120
How long have I been in here?

3200
02:59:37,300 --> 02:59:38,580
How long?

3201
02:59:41,160 --> 02:59:41,800
Oh

3202
02:59:47,100 --> 02:59:47,740
gosh.

3203
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:49,640
No.

3204
02:59:50,420 --> 02:59:52,020
Okay, Gustav.

3205
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:53,280
I can try.

3206
02:59:53,820 --> 02:59:54,660
Gustav.

3207
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:58,440
Second floor.

3208
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:02,860
Run.

3209
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:05,480
Gustav.

3210
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:06,700
I think I tried that too.

3211
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:12,560
Here I go.

3212
03:00:12,560 --> 03:00:17,380
Scream my lungs out and try to get you to listen to me.

3213
03:00:17,880 --> 03:00:19,840
Rio, please.

3214
03:00:23,220 --> 03:00:25,380
Move right.

3215
03:00:26,280 --> 03:00:27,780
Move right.

3216
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:30,880
Turn around.

3217
03:00:35,500 --> 03:00:36,560
Stop.

3218
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:38,020
Stop.

3219
03:00:39,480 --> 03:00:40,960
The one time.

3220
03:00:41,920 --> 03:00:45,960
The one time I said stop and she...

3221
03:00:48,100 --> 03:00:49,360
Check room.

3222
03:00:50,600 --> 03:00:51,440
No!

3223
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:53,840
Stop!

3224
03:00:54,380 --> 03:00:54,700
Stop!

3225
03:00:58,670 --> 03:00:59,630
Second floor.

3226
03:01:02,770 --> 03:01:03,910
Check room.

3227
03:01:03,990 --> 03:01:05,050
That's what I did.

3228
03:01:05,570 --> 03:01:08,010
That's what you told me to do and I did it.

3229
03:01:10,150 --> 03:01:11,470
Turn around.

3230
03:01:12,550 --> 03:01:14,170
Turn around.

3231
03:01:14,750 --> 03:01:16,590
Turn around.

3232
03:01:17,730 --> 03:01:21,750
Every now and then I feel a little bit...

3233
03:01:21,750 --> 03:01:24,130
And you're never coming around.

3234
03:01:24,490 --> 03:01:26,110
Turn around.

3235
03:01:26,550 --> 03:01:30,270
Every now and then I feel a little bit tired.

3236
03:01:30,750 --> 03:01:34,110
Listening to the sound of my turn around.

3237
03:01:34,870 --> 03:01:39,950
Every now and then I don't want to go into the room anymore.

3238
03:01:39,950 --> 03:01:41,630
Turn around.

3239
03:01:42,170 --> 03:01:48,070
A little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes.

3240
03:01:48,530 --> 03:01:49,350
Turn around.

3241
03:01:50,190 --> 03:01:51,890
Bright eyes.

3242
03:01:52,170 --> 03:01:54,790
Every now and then I fall apart.

3243
03:01:55,290 --> 03:01:57,250
Bright eyes.

3244
03:01:57,550 --> 03:02:00,210
Every now and then I fall apart.

3245
03:02:00,770 --> 03:02:03,450
And I need you now tonight.

3246
03:02:04,130 --> 03:02:07,130
And I need you more than ever.

3247
03:02:07,130 --> 03:02:10,770
And if you only listen to me, Rio.

3248
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:18,590
Gustav's room.

3249
03:02:21,830 --> 03:02:28,100
I think Rio is discriminating against him.

3250
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:30,600
I think she wants to believe he doesn't exist.

3251
03:02:32,340 --> 03:02:33,800
Eleven, welcome to membership.

3252
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:34,400
Thank you.

3253
03:02:37,340 --> 03:02:38,740
Gustav's room.

3254
03:02:40,900 --> 03:02:42,380
Don't shrug!

3255
03:02:42,420 --> 03:02:43,980
Don't shrug at me.

3256
03:02:44,260 --> 03:02:45,320
Don't do this.

3257
03:02:48,540 --> 03:02:49,780
Gustav's room.

3258
03:02:50,140 --> 03:02:51,220
Gustav's room.

3259
03:02:51,780 --> 03:02:52,940
Gustav's room.

3260
03:02:53,740 --> 03:02:54,640
What should I move?

3261
03:02:54,940 --> 03:02:55,280
No.

3262
03:02:55,880 --> 03:02:56,440
Room.

3263
03:02:56,840 --> 03:02:57,660
What should I move?

3264
03:02:59,940 --> 03:03:02,320
I don't know what to do, you guys.

3265
03:03:03,400 --> 03:03:04,140
Gustav!

3266
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:06,960
Don't shrug!

3267
03:03:16,790 --> 03:03:17,750
Gustav!

3268
03:03:18,910 --> 03:03:20,070
Gustav's room.

3269
03:03:20,770 --> 03:03:21,730
Gustav!

3270
03:03:23,610 --> 03:03:24,090
No!

3271
03:03:25,390 --> 03:03:25,870
Stop.

3272
03:03:26,510 --> 03:03:26,950
Stop.

3273
03:03:27,730 --> 03:03:29,370
Turn right.

3274
03:03:30,870 --> 03:03:31,810
What?

3275
03:03:32,090 --> 03:03:32,570
Oh my God.

3276
03:03:32,630 --> 03:03:32,930
Stop.

3277
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:33,350
Please.

3278
03:03:34,770 --> 03:03:36,970
Oh my God.

3279
03:03:37,770 --> 03:03:39,250
I'm seeing red.

3280
03:03:40,190 --> 03:03:40,530
No!

3281
03:03:40,710 --> 03:03:41,090
Stop.

3282
03:03:42,530 --> 03:03:43,490
Stop!

3283
03:04:01,570 --> 03:04:03,850
Service staff quarters.

3284
03:04:06,130 --> 03:04:07,510
I don't care anymore.

3285
03:04:07,810 --> 03:04:08,150
Run.

3286
03:04:08,810 --> 03:04:09,110
Run.

3287
03:04:12,990 --> 03:04:13,950
Gustav.

3288
03:04:13,950 --> 03:04:15,250
Gustav's room.

3289
03:04:16,730 --> 03:04:20,010
She doesn't listen to anything, you guys.

3290
03:04:20,010 --> 03:04:22,190
She doesn't listen to anything.

3291
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:37,920
Gustav.

3292
03:04:41,360 --> 03:04:42,120
Gustav.

3293
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:45,460
Gustav.

3294
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:47,620
Gustav.

3295
03:04:47,620 --> 03:04:47,620
Gustiv.

3296
03:04:47,920 --> 03:04:48,980
Gustav.

3297
03:04:49,400 --> 03:04:50,500
Gustav.

3298
03:04:51,380 --> 03:04:52,040
Gustav.

3299
03:04:52,040 --> 03:04:53,880
Shoot yourself.

3300
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:05,800
One of them is me, Rio.

3301
03:05:06,400 --> 03:05:07,420
One of them is me.

3302
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:14,480
You understood that, huh?

3303
03:05:16,520 --> 03:05:18,700
You understood that, huh Rio?

3304
03:05:20,360 --> 03:05:21,380
Johnny's room.

3305
03:05:21,380 --> 03:05:22,100
What?

3306
03:05:22,680 --> 03:05:23,320
Where are we going?

3307
03:05:24,160 --> 03:05:26,100
Ok, we are going on an adventure everybody.

3308
03:05:27,400 --> 03:05:29,420
To a mysterious location.

3309
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:31,460
Wherever Rio... She's getting sentient.

3310
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:33,000
What was happening?

3311
03:05:34,420 --> 03:05:35,640
Sounds like a helicopter.

3312
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:38,220
What is that?

3313
03:05:40,840 --> 03:05:41,900
Oh, it's shooting.

3314
03:05:48,420 --> 03:05:50,080
That's a lot of fire.

3315
03:05:51,060 --> 03:05:52,580
How do they have unlimited ammo?

3316
03:05:55,320 --> 03:05:56,020
It's blocked.

3317
03:05:56,180 --> 03:05:56,720
But what's that?

3318
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:57,300
There's a jelly.

3319
03:05:57,880 --> 03:05:58,300
No, no, no!

3320
03:05:58,380 --> 03:05:59,380
Don't run past the jelly!

3321
03:06:11,710 --> 03:06:12,850
If you'll listen to me.

3322
03:06:13,330 --> 03:06:14,370
I don't think you will.

3323
03:06:14,730 --> 03:06:15,710
I don't think you will, Rio.

3324
03:06:15,710 --> 03:06:15,830
Rio!

3325
03:06:20,290 --> 03:06:23,410
Keep yourself safe, Rio.

3326
03:06:23,770 --> 03:06:24,990
What happened?

3327
03:06:32,230 --> 03:06:34,030
A wobble.

3328
03:06:41,190 --> 03:06:43,490
Not the wobble.

3329
03:06:44,090 --> 03:06:44,450
Major wobble.

3330
03:06:46,750 --> 03:06:49,470
I think there was a warehouse key in my room.

3331
03:06:49,750 --> 03:06:50,870
Let's go get it.

3332
03:06:51,630 --> 03:06:53,090
It's in the service staff quarters.

3333
03:07:01,590 --> 03:07:02,750
Area A.

3334
03:07:06,930 --> 03:07:07,510
Run.

3335
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:08,250
Run.

3336
03:07:13,430 --> 03:07:14,810
She's so helpless.

3337
03:07:16,690 --> 03:07:18,850
No, don't turn back.

3338
03:07:19,530 --> 03:07:19,730
Jelly.

3339
03:07:20,010 --> 03:07:20,810
Oh, there she got it.

3340
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:28,570
Oh my goodness.

3341
03:07:32,270 --> 03:07:35,650
Should we try going back to Gustav's room?

3342
03:07:39,390 --> 03:07:40,770
I don't know.

3343
03:07:41,090 --> 03:07:42,690
What the...

3344
03:07:43,390 --> 03:07:44,090
Middle I.

3345
03:07:45,110 --> 03:07:45,870
Run.

3346
03:07:49,490 --> 03:07:50,630
Right I.

3347
03:07:51,930 --> 03:07:53,010
Left I.

3348
03:07:53,930 --> 03:07:54,410
Nice.

3349
03:07:54,850 --> 03:07:55,490
Right I.

3350
03:07:56,390 --> 03:07:57,050
Oh we have to wait.

3351
03:07:57,410 --> 03:07:57,730
Tail!

3352
03:08:00,550 --> 03:08:01,710
Turn around.

3353
03:08:02,370 --> 03:08:03,130
Turn around little guy.

3354
03:08:03,870 --> 03:08:04,250
Tail!

3355
03:08:04,250 --> 03:08:04,310
Tail!

3356
03:08:06,150 --> 03:08:07,030
Body!

3357
03:08:08,070 --> 03:08:09,070
That works too.

3358
03:08:09,290 --> 03:08:09,810
Right I.

3359
03:08:10,770 --> 03:08:11,630
Mouth?

3360
03:08:22,750 --> 03:08:25,230
Where did that thing come from?

3361
03:08:26,710 --> 03:08:28,250
Control staff quarters.

3362
03:08:31,410 --> 03:08:32,290
Run.

3363
03:08:36,550 --> 03:08:37,230
Okay.

3364
03:08:40,660 --> 03:08:41,340
Okay.

3365
03:08:43,360 --> 03:08:44,300
Gustav skipped.

3366
03:08:47,180 --> 03:08:49,720
I'm scared to go back in here.

3367
03:08:51,860 --> 03:08:53,420
What if you say right door?

3368
03:08:53,900 --> 03:08:55,000
We can try that.

3369
03:08:55,740 --> 03:08:57,040
Room on the right.

3370
03:08:57,240 --> 03:08:58,080
Let's try that.

3371
03:09:01,260 --> 03:09:02,420
Where should I go?

3372
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:04,200
Second floor.

3373
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:06,600
Run.

3374
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:11,960
I don't want to be here anymore.

3375
03:09:12,660 --> 03:09:14,640
But we also need to get the lockers open.

3376
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,200
Room on the right.

3377
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:29,860
Right door.

3378
03:09:31,640 --> 03:09:32,880
Right door.

3379
03:09:42,120 --> 03:09:43,360
Second floor.

3380
03:09:48,520 --> 03:09:50,860
Chat send voice clips?

3381
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:57,280
Wait, how would you guys send voice clips to me?

3382
03:09:59,800 --> 03:10:00,760
Through Twitter?

3383
03:10:01,480 --> 03:10:02,780
No way!

3384
03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:05,920
Try Gustav with the uh sound of u.

3385
03:10:06,320 --> 03:10:08,020
I did try that!

3386
03:10:08,120 --> 03:10:08,560
I did!

3387
03:10:09,240 --> 03:10:10,420
I tried!

3388
03:10:11,100 --> 03:10:12,740
I tried!

3389
03:10:15,930 --> 03:10:18,750
I've tried Gustav!

3390
03:10:19,310 --> 03:10:20,710
Gustav!

3391
03:10:21,550 --> 03:10:22,950
Gustav!

3392
03:10:23,250 --> 03:10:24,410
Gustav!

3393
03:10:24,910 --> 03:10:26,050
Gustav!

3394
03:10:26,490 --> 03:10:28,350
I've tried it all!

3395
03:10:31,950 --> 03:10:33,590
I've tried!

3396
03:10:34,850 --> 03:10:36,330
Just Gus?

3397
03:10:38,090 --> 03:10:38,790
Gus?

3398
03:10:38,790 --> 03:10:39,550
Yes.

3399
03:10:40,990 --> 03:10:42,750
Gus' room.

3400
03:10:43,950 --> 03:10:44,270
No!

3401
03:10:49,530 --> 03:10:50,930
Stop!

3402
03:10:55,790 --> 03:10:56,910
Second...

3403
03:10:57,770 --> 03:10:59,250
Second floor.

3404
03:11:26,640 --> 03:11:27,760
Second floor.

3405
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:28,760
Say room number.

3406
03:11:28,860 --> 03:11:30,420
There is no room number!

3407
03:11:34,840 --> 03:11:36,820
I feel like I'm getting gas lit.

3408
03:11:39,420 --> 03:11:41,800
I feel like I'm getting gas lit.

3409
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:42,940
Look at her.

3410
03:11:43,020 --> 03:11:44,560
She just gets tired of walking.

3411
03:11:45,320 --> 03:11:46,960
She is so pathetic.

3412
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:49,300
Southern accent.

3413
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:51,120
Gustav's room.

3414
03:11:53,960 --> 03:11:54,520
Stop.

3415
03:11:55,880 --> 03:11:56,600
Forward.

3416
03:11:58,100 --> 03:11:59,260
What?!

3417
03:12:04,730 --> 03:12:05,890
Stop.

3418
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:09,950
I tried Gus!

3419
03:12:10,170 --> 03:12:11,370
It does not work!

3420
03:12:12,410 --> 03:12:12,770
Gus?

3421
03:12:12,770 --> 03:12:13,630
Gus?

3422
03:12:13,750 --> 03:12:14,950
Gus' room.

3423
03:12:20,290 --> 03:12:26,780
Okay guys, we can't fumble this.

3424
03:12:27,460 --> 03:12:28,520
We can't fumble this.

3425
03:12:31,220 --> 03:12:32,320
Oh my god.

3426
03:12:32,840 --> 03:12:34,860
I'm just not even going to tell her to do anything.

3427
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:38,540
I'm not going to tell...

3428
03:12:46,280 --> 03:12:47,880
Read this.

3429
03:12:53,740 --> 03:12:55,580
Read this.

3430
03:12:56,100 --> 03:12:56,800
What do I say?

3431
03:12:58,060 --> 03:13:01,620
Two chloro, three methyl butane.

3432
03:13:09,960 --> 03:13:15,270
I need to do a victory lap.

3433
03:13:21,690 --> 03:13:22,450
What?

3434
03:13:33,370 --> 03:13:35,250
Where is she going?

3435
03:13:35,830 --> 03:13:36,530
Go back!

3436
03:13:37,910 --> 03:13:38,990
Go back.

3437
03:13:40,070 --> 03:13:41,190
Go back.

3438
03:13:41,570 --> 03:13:42,630
What did she do?

3439
03:13:43,410 --> 03:13:44,070
Go in there.

3440
03:13:44,730 --> 03:13:45,470
Go inside.

3441
03:13:45,470 --> 03:13:47,930
Where is she going?

3442
03:13:48,050 --> 03:13:49,330
What happened?

3443
03:13:49,690 --> 03:13:51,050
Oh, I got a key card.

3444
03:13:53,370 --> 03:13:55,150
She said there was nothing else.

3445
03:13:55,290 --> 03:13:56,710
She picked up an ID card.

3446
03:13:57,750 --> 03:13:58,590
That's it?

3447
03:14:00,050 --> 03:14:00,910
That's it?

3448
03:14:12,260 --> 03:14:13,280
That was it?

3449
03:14:13,720 --> 03:14:16,080
Do you think...

3450
03:14:18,180 --> 03:14:19,160
Oh, I wonder.

3451
03:14:19,340 --> 03:14:19,880
Locker ID.

3452
03:14:20,180 --> 03:14:21,920
Oh, they do have the locker stuff.

3453
03:14:23,560 --> 03:14:24,080
Lockers.

3454
03:14:26,680 --> 03:14:29,420
The ID cards have their locker number on it.

3455
03:14:29,580 --> 03:14:30,480
Actually, you know what?

3456
03:14:31,080 --> 03:14:32,820
Hopefully this is worth it.

3457
03:14:33,220 --> 03:14:34,980
Hopefully this is worth it.

3458
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:37,840
This might be worth it.

3459
03:14:44,970 --> 03:14:46,350
I'm babbling, baby.

3460
03:14:46,810 --> 03:14:47,490
1-5.

3461
03:14:47,730 --> 03:14:48,690
1-5.

3462
03:14:48,770 --> 03:14:49,330
1-5.

3463
03:14:49,410 --> 03:14:50,150
1-5-5.

3464
03:14:50,430 --> 03:14:50,870
1-5.

3465
03:14:50,950 --> 03:14:51,230
1-5.

3466
03:14:51,310 --> 03:14:51,870
1-5-5.

3467
03:14:57,030 --> 03:14:58,750
Jonathan's locker.

3468
03:15:01,170 --> 03:15:01,390
No.

3469
03:15:01,690 --> 03:15:01,850
No.

3470
03:15:03,130 --> 03:15:03,790
Lockers.

3471
03:15:04,990 --> 03:15:05,650
Lockers.

3472
03:15:12,950 --> 03:15:14,270
Lockers.

3473
03:15:15,110 --> 03:15:15,490
Okay.

3474
03:15:21,090 --> 03:15:24,490
You guys, I will save after I finish this part.

3475
03:15:25,150 --> 03:15:25,790
Don't worry.

3476
03:15:25,890 --> 03:15:27,430
You don't need to scream at me.

3477
03:15:29,710 --> 03:15:30,370
Okay.

3478
03:15:31,730 --> 03:15:32,490
Gustav.

3479
03:15:35,110 --> 03:15:36,630
1-5.

3480
03:15:36,950 --> 03:15:38,330
1-5.

3481
03:15:38,530 --> 03:15:39,950
1-5-5.

3482
03:15:40,410 --> 03:15:41,030
Okay.

3483
03:15:41,030 --> 03:15:41,270
Okay.

3484
03:15:47,270 --> 03:15:48,950
It's full of candy.

3485
03:15:55,010 --> 03:15:57,570
I don't think this guy is right.

3486
03:15:59,330 --> 03:16:01,410
I don't think this guy is okay.

3487
03:16:02,210 --> 03:16:04,170
He's spending...

3488
03:16:09,910 --> 03:16:12,850
799-4265 7...

3489
03:16:12,850 --> 03:16:14,830
Shit.

3490
03:16:15,510 --> 03:16:16,370
Oh shit.

3491
03:16:16,490 --> 03:16:18,070
I can't select it anymore.

3492
03:16:19,370 --> 03:16:20,290
Lockers.

3493
03:16:24,150 --> 03:16:24,710
Okay.

3494
03:16:24,890 --> 03:16:25,250
There we go.

3495
03:16:26,370 --> 03:16:28,550
7-9-9...

3496
03:16:29,270 --> 03:16:34,190
4-5-6-2...

3497
03:16:34,190 --> 03:16:34,410
No.

3498
03:16:34,910 --> 03:16:37,090
4-2-4-2.

3499
03:16:38,250 --> 03:16:39,230
6-5.

3500
03:16:42,050 --> 03:16:43,130
Thank you.

3501
03:16:45,890 --> 03:16:47,870
What is that?

3502
03:17:10,550 --> 03:17:11,790
Save point.

3503
03:17:13,650 --> 03:17:14,930
Save point.

3504
03:17:17,490 --> 03:17:20,010
Congratulations on surviving the Oh No Room.

3505
03:17:21,370 --> 03:17:22,210
Thank you.

3506
03:17:23,310 --> 03:17:24,170
Thank you.

3507
03:17:24,390 --> 03:17:25,190
Now I understand.

3508
03:17:27,810 --> 03:17:29,690
We defeated the evil.

3509
03:17:34,200 --> 03:17:37,960
I can't believe we spent like over an hour in this room alone.

3510
03:17:40,840 --> 03:17:45,160
I can't believe we spent over an hour in just this room.

3511
03:17:53,510 --> 03:17:55,070
That's how I feel right now.

3512
03:17:56,530 --> 03:17:57,090
Alright.

3513
03:17:57,250 --> 03:17:58,990
We're going to leave room.

3514
03:17:58,990 --> 03:17:59,730
Leave room.

3515
03:18:02,610 --> 03:18:03,670
Leave.

3516
03:18:04,650 --> 03:18:05,670
Leave room.

3517
03:18:07,010 --> 03:18:07,350
Yes.

3518
03:18:08,530 --> 03:18:09,050
Run.

3519
03:18:10,690 --> 03:18:11,810
Oh my god.

3520
03:18:12,210 --> 03:18:13,110
Leave room.

3521
03:18:21,630 --> 03:18:26,890
You should go to the service staff quarters.

3522
03:18:29,460 --> 03:18:31,770
Go to service staff quarters.

3523
03:18:33,030 --> 03:18:33,670
Yes.

3524
03:18:35,390 --> 03:18:36,530
I'm exhausted.

3525
03:18:37,550 --> 03:18:38,190
I'm...

3526
03:18:39,230 --> 03:18:40,790
I'm so tired.

3527
03:18:41,110 --> 03:18:42,670
I'm so tired.

3528
03:18:44,770 --> 03:18:46,050
I'm exhausted.

3529
03:18:48,130 --> 03:18:48,910
Hold on.

3530
03:18:48,950 --> 03:18:50,150
I have to have some snack.

3531
03:19:03,100 --> 03:19:03,500
Oh my gosh.

3532
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:05,180
She can do something for herself for once.

3533
03:19:06,640 --> 03:19:07,700
What are you eating?

3534
03:19:08,100 --> 03:19:08,640
Oh my gosh.

3535
03:19:09,740 --> 03:19:10,380
So...

3536
03:19:13,260 --> 03:19:14,480
What is this?

3537
03:19:16,300 --> 03:19:17,460
It's awful.

3538
03:19:18,060 --> 03:19:18,920
This is bad.

3539
03:19:20,300 --> 03:19:21,560
The absolute malicious intent.

3540
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:26,220
The person who named that character in a way that rhymes with go and stop.

3541
03:19:26,320 --> 03:19:26,920
Evil genius.

3542
03:19:28,520 --> 03:19:29,140
Wait.

3543
03:19:29,740 --> 03:19:30,640
I'll tell you what I'm eating.

3544
03:19:37,480 --> 03:19:38,440
Middle eye.

3545
03:19:40,100 --> 03:19:41,080
Right eye.

3546
03:19:42,640 --> 03:19:43,220
Right eye.

3547
03:19:44,740 --> 03:19:45,460
Root.

3548
03:19:46,440 --> 03:19:47,500
Root.

3549
03:19:48,640 --> 03:19:49,220
Run.

3550
03:19:53,530 --> 03:19:54,170
Enemy 2.

3551
03:19:55,230 --> 03:19:55,610
Mouth.

3552
03:19:56,970 --> 03:19:57,630
Auto fire.

3553
03:20:00,310 --> 03:20:00,890
Okay.

3554
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:02,590
Oh my goodness.

3555
03:20:03,270 --> 03:20:03,670
Run.

3556
03:20:05,610 --> 03:20:06,770
Oh my god.

3557
03:20:07,430 --> 03:20:12,050
I don't know how to...

3558
03:20:12,050 --> 03:20:13,310
Dodge.

3559
03:20:15,150 --> 03:20:15,850
Dodge.

3560
03:20:16,710 --> 03:20:17,410
Dodge.

3561
03:20:21,190 --> 03:20:21,890
Rhymes.

3562
03:20:27,120 --> 03:20:27,440
Hey guys.

3563
03:20:27,580 --> 03:20:29,340
I don't think you know what the strafe does.

3564
03:20:29,700 --> 03:20:30,300
Strafe.

3565
03:20:33,080 --> 03:20:34,960
Strafe is just her shooting.

3566
03:20:35,500 --> 03:20:35,980
Strafe.

3567
03:20:37,900 --> 03:20:39,240
That's all it does.

3568
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:40,460
Strafe.

3569
03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:43,820
Reload.

3570
03:20:43,820 --> 03:20:46,820
I don't think they know what strafe means.

3571
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:48,340
Because I know what strafe means.

3572
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:49,820
But strafe left.

3573
03:20:51,120 --> 03:20:51,380
See?

3574
03:20:51,460 --> 03:20:52,060
It doesn't work.

3575
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:55,320
It's really stupid.

3576
03:20:56,240 --> 03:20:56,860
Strafe.

3577
03:20:58,720 --> 03:21:00,500
It does give good damage though.

3578
03:21:00,920 --> 03:21:01,400
Strafe.

3579
03:21:03,560 --> 03:21:04,180
Stop.

3580
03:21:05,360 --> 03:21:05,880
Oh.

3581
03:21:05,980 --> 03:21:06,400
She died.

3582
03:21:08,800 --> 03:21:09,420
Oops.

3583
03:21:10,240 --> 03:21:10,500
Sorry.

3584
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:11,600
I didn't realize she was almost dead.

3585
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:12,240
Anyway.

3586
03:21:12,800 --> 03:21:14,800
The thing I'm snacking on is...

3587
03:21:14,800 --> 03:21:16,500
It was a gift from Ayamimama.

3588
03:21:17,540 --> 03:21:19,520
And it's this Japanese...

3589
03:21:19,520 --> 03:21:20,280
Like snack.

3590
03:21:21,040 --> 03:21:22,520
Called Itoko no Rusk.

3591
03:21:23,940 --> 03:21:25,480
Itoko no Rusk.

3592
03:21:25,560 --> 03:21:27,420
If you are ever in Japan and you are able to get this.

3593
03:21:27,480 --> 03:21:28,060
It's so good.

3594
03:21:28,320 --> 03:21:30,140
Because this stuff is like the butter sugar.

3595
03:21:30,880 --> 03:21:31,600
And it's like...

3596
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:33,760
They have different various types.

3597
03:21:33,920 --> 03:21:35,360
But this is like a candy...

3598
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:36,960
Like a cracker version.

3599
03:21:36,960 --> 03:21:39,060
A biscuit version.

3600
03:21:40,540 --> 03:21:41,420
And it's...

3601
03:21:41,420 --> 03:21:41,920
It's...

3602
03:21:42,460 --> 03:21:44,520
I don't know how else to say.

3603
03:21:44,620 --> 03:21:46,900
Because it just literally says Itoko no Rusk.

3604
03:21:46,980 --> 03:21:47,640
Butter sugar.

3605
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:50,580
But she also gave me another one that was like a soft.

3606
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:53,180
And it had caramel and butter in it.

3607
03:21:53,260 --> 03:21:54,660
But this one is like...

3608
03:21:54,660 --> 03:21:55,840
This one is like a biscuit.

3609
03:21:57,380 --> 03:21:58,420
And I snack on it.

3610
03:21:59,920 --> 03:22:00,360
But...

3611
03:22:00,360 --> 03:22:00,740
Yeah.

3612
03:22:00,820 --> 03:22:01,740
It's so good.

3613
03:22:01,840 --> 03:22:03,620
I recommend this one.

3614
03:22:03,620 --> 03:22:05,260
The other one is still good.

3615
03:22:05,340 --> 03:22:06,880
But this one is...

3616
03:22:07,480 --> 03:22:08,420
This one is so good.

3617
03:22:08,540 --> 03:22:09,580
Itoko no Rusk.

3618
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:11,040
Itoko no Rusk.

3619
03:22:12,780 --> 03:22:13,660
It's my...

3620
03:22:13,660 --> 03:22:14,180
Osusume.

3621
03:22:14,520 --> 03:22:15,200
My recommendation.

3622
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:16,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3623
03:22:16,640 --> 03:22:17,900
It looks like broken waffle cones.

3624
03:22:18,140 --> 03:22:19,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3625
03:22:19,260 --> 03:22:20,360
That one, that one, that one.

3626
03:22:20,400 --> 03:22:21,260
It's so yummy.

3627
03:22:21,820 --> 03:22:22,540
It's so, so yummy.

3628
03:22:23,100 --> 03:22:24,260
It's a butter sugar flavor.

3629
03:22:24,440 --> 03:22:24,880
It's so good.

3630
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:28,480
So...

3631
03:22:28,940 --> 03:22:31,520
Actually, this expired...

3632
03:22:31,520 --> 03:22:32,320
Last month.

3633
03:22:34,420 --> 03:22:36,260
I just noticed.

3634
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:39,140
It expired January 12th.

3635
03:22:39,960 --> 03:22:41,060
Okay, I'm gonna...

3636
03:22:41,060 --> 03:22:41,920
I gotta get through it.

3637
03:22:43,600 --> 03:22:43,960
Okay.

3638
03:22:47,940 --> 03:22:49,260
It's just...

3639
03:22:50,060 --> 03:22:51,680
It's not gonna go bad.

3640
03:22:52,160 --> 03:22:52,480
Right?

3641
03:22:53,280 --> 03:22:54,120
It's like a biscuit.

3642
03:23:04,220 --> 03:23:04,740
It's fine.

3643
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:05,760
It still tastes so good.

3644
03:23:10,580 --> 03:23:11,020
Anyway.

3645
03:23:12,180 --> 03:23:13,140
It's a best buy date.

3646
03:23:13,240 --> 03:23:14,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3647
03:23:17,720 --> 03:23:18,160
Exactly.

3648
03:23:19,240 --> 03:23:19,760
We're fine.

3649
03:23:20,140 --> 03:23:20,520
Probably.

3650
03:23:22,020 --> 03:23:23,900
But it's still soft and delicious.

3651
03:23:27,140 --> 03:23:28,320
The other one.

3652
03:23:28,460 --> 03:23:28,900
Oh my gosh.

3653
03:23:29,620 --> 03:23:32,280
The other stuff, it was a little too...

3654
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:33,900
Buttery and caramelly for me.

3655
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:35,800
Well, not caramelly, but like...

3656
03:23:35,800 --> 03:23:37,940
It was like, it felt like straight butter on the inside.

3657
03:23:37,940 --> 03:23:39,940
So what I've been doing...

3658
03:23:40,980 --> 03:23:42,260
Is I've been opening it.

3659
03:23:42,260 --> 03:23:43,540
I've been opening it up.

3660
03:23:44,340 --> 03:23:45,520
And putting it on waffles.

3661
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:47,720
Okay.

3662
03:23:48,300 --> 03:23:48,940
Leave room.

3663
03:23:52,640 --> 03:23:53,800
Leave room.

3664
03:23:56,440 --> 03:23:57,300
Uh, hallway.

3665
03:23:58,540 --> 03:23:58,880
Yes.

3666
03:24:06,420 --> 03:24:07,020
Nice.

3667
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:10,460
Actually...

3668
03:24:11,380 --> 03:24:11,980
Sincere?

3669
03:24:12,560 --> 03:24:13,620

3670
03:24:13,860 --> 03:24:14,340
Thank you.

3671
03:24:14,880 --> 03:24:16,260

3672
03:24:16,260 --> 03:24:18,080
Oh, also, someone sent...

3673
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:19,580

03:24:19,800 --> 03:24:20,220
Thank you.

3675
03:24:22,460 --> 03:24:24,720

3676
03:24:24,720 --> 03:24:25,540
She sells.

3677
03:24:25,540 --> 03:24:26,180
What?

3678
03:24:29,160 --> 03:24:30,740
Oh, okay.

3679
03:24:32,040 --> 03:24:32,720
Um...

3680
03:24:32,720 --> 03:24:34,460
Go to service staff.

3681
03:24:37,300 --> 03:24:37,640
Yeah.

3682
03:24:38,520 --> 03:24:39,080
Okey dokey.

3683
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:40,160
Run.

3684
03:24:43,320 --> 03:24:45,440
Alright, this one is kind of tricky.

3685
03:24:45,760 --> 03:24:47,560
So we're gonna have to...

3686
03:24:47,560 --> 03:24:48,400
Do our best.

3687
03:24:56,560 --> 03:24:57,240
Yes.

3688
03:24:57,700 --> 03:24:58,340

3689
03:24:58,340 --> 03:24:58,400
Yes.

3690
03:25:00,400 --> 03:25:03,000
Melt me on waffle and eat me, please.

3691
03:25:03,160 --> 03:25:03,460
No.

3692
03:25:04,940 --> 03:25:05,800
Sounds horrible.

3693
03:25:09,760 --> 03:25:11,100
Bad news bears.

3694
03:25:20,000 --> 03:25:20,600
Okay.

3695
03:25:23,140 --> 03:25:24,540

03:26:01,930 --> 03:26:04,270
Uh... I didn't say leaf or anything.

3711
03:26:04,850 --> 03:26:05,350
Enemy two.

3712
03:26:06,530 --> 03:26:07,010

3713
03:26:08,310 --> 03:26:08,870
Mouth.

3714
03:26:10,310 --> 03:26:10,710
Mouth.

3715
03:26:11,550 --> 03:26:12,910

Left eye.

3721
03:26:23,230 --> 03:26:23,970
Is it healing?

3722
03:26:28,110 --> 03:26:28,750
Vines.

3723
03:26:30,190 --> 03:26:30,290

We actually did it.

3748
03:27:30,130 --> 03:27:30,710
Nice.

3749
03:27:30,850 --> 03:27:31,990
With minimal damage even.

3750
03:27:32,170 --> 03:27:33,110
That was pretty good actually.

3751
03:27:35,570 --> 03:27:37,080
That was actually pretty good.

3752
03:27:38,690 --> 03:27:39,230
Say it.

3753
03:27:39,390 --> 03:27:40,550
Tell me I'm pretty good.

3754

Activate my...

3755
03:27:42,950 --> 03:27:44,390
I feel like a sleeper agent.

3756
03:27:44,390 --> 03:27:44,890
Oh my gosh.

3757
03:27:45,750 --> 03:27:46,350
Hold on.

3758
03:27:48,010 --> 03:27:49,650
What the hell is that?

3759
03:27:49,790 --> 03:27:51,190
We got a lizard in our room.

3760
03:27:55,170 --> 03:27:56,650
Rio, people are dying.

3761
03:27:56,650 --> 03:27:58,650
My pictures.

3762
03:28:00,130 --> 03:28:01,510
Where are all my pictures?

3763
03:28:05,210 --> 03:28:08,950
This is awful.

3764
03:28:10,310 --> 03:28:10,990
I just...

3765
03:28:11,910 --> 03:28:13,030
I give up.

3766
03:28:13,450 --> 03:28:13,450
What?

3767
03:28:13,830 --> 03:28:14,230
What?

3768
03:28:15,250 --> 03:28:16,210
What?

3769
03:28:16,650 --> 03:28:17,110
Rio.

3770
03:28:18,470 --> 03:28:18,950
Rio.

3771
03:28:20,430 --> 03:28:21,390
Rio.

3772
03:28:21,830 --> 03:28:23,670
There are so many mementos.

3773
03:28:26,010 --> 03:28:26,970
Don't give up.

3774
03:28:33,370 --> 03:28:34,990
Get a hold of yourself.

3775
03:28:46,050 --> 03:28:47,030
She's like okay.

3776
03:28:48,410 --> 03:28:49,270
Mental break over.

3777
03:28:52,690 --> 03:28:54,470
Gosh, I need to be as...

3778
03:28:54,470 --> 03:28:56,970
I wish I had a brain like Rio's.

3779
03:28:57,570 --> 03:28:59,190
She recovered so easily.

3780
03:28:59,950 --> 03:29:00,430
Wow.

3781
03:29:03,450 --> 03:29:05,170
Strafe, isn't that the twink from FF7?

3782
03:29:06,890 --> 03:29:08,350
What was I saying though?

3783
03:29:08,590 --> 03:29:09,230
Oh my gosh.

3784
03:29:09,710 --> 03:29:12,110
The other day my mom was like ranting to me.

3785
03:29:12,470 --> 03:29:13,770
About someone.

3786
03:29:15,730 --> 03:29:16,210
And...

3787
03:29:16,790 --> 03:29:18,730
Basically she wanted to complain to a company.

3788
03:29:18,810 --> 03:29:19,730
What did I come here to do?

3789
03:29:19,930 --> 03:29:21,710
But she kept...

3790
03:29:21,710 --> 03:29:23,930
She kept...

3791
03:29:23,930 --> 03:29:26,270
She doesn't know the pain of having to say Gustav.

3792
03:29:26,410 --> 03:29:26,810
I know.

3793
03:29:28,490 --> 03:29:29,450
But she...

3794
03:29:29,450 --> 03:29:31,290
She kept...

3795
03:29:31,290 --> 03:29:33,530
Referring to the...

3796
03:29:33,530 --> 03:29:35,530
To the manager as the big boss.

3797
03:29:36,310 --> 03:29:38,050
And I felt like a sleeper.

3798
03:29:38,350 --> 03:29:39,330
I was like mom.

3799
03:29:39,690 --> 03:29:41,230
This is a very serious conversation.

3800
03:29:41,390 --> 03:29:43,070
And I cannot take you seriously.

3801
03:29:43,390 --> 03:29:45,130
If you keep saying big boss.

3802
03:29:48,270 --> 03:29:50,070
I was like don't do this to me mom.

3803
03:29:50,110 --> 03:29:51,350
You don't know my brain.

3804
03:29:51,350 --> 03:29:52,430
And I felt...

3805
03:29:52,430 --> 03:29:55,490
I felt like I would be activated every time.

3806
03:29:57,510 --> 03:29:58,370
Activation phrase.

3807
03:29:58,470 --> 03:29:58,750
Truly.

3808
03:29:59,210 --> 03:30:01,470
What did we come here for?

3809
03:30:01,870 --> 03:30:03,370
What was that?

3810
03:30:04,630 --> 03:30:05,370
Warehouse key.

3811
03:30:10,210 --> 03:30:11,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3812
03:30:11,430 --> 03:30:12,070
I remember.

3813
03:30:14,730 --> 03:30:16,570
My mom just kept saying big boss.

3814
03:30:16,670 --> 03:30:18,070
I'm gonna go talk to the big boss.

3815
03:30:26,050 --> 03:30:26,590
My...

3816
03:30:26,590 --> 03:30:28,050
I can never...

3817
03:30:28,050 --> 03:30:30,350
I can never exist in the same way.

3818
03:30:32,150 --> 03:30:32,690
Wait.

3819
03:30:33,390 --> 03:30:34,450
Is there nothing else in there?

3820
03:30:46,250 --> 03:30:46,790
Galley.

3821
03:30:57,010 --> 03:30:58,050
Heel capsule.

3822
03:31:00,310 --> 03:31:01,110
Nice suit.

3823
03:31:03,450 --> 03:31:05,050
There is a save point.

3824
03:31:06,090 --> 03:31:06,890
Save point.

3825
03:31:14,540 --> 03:31:15,580
Hot dog.

3826
03:31:15,700 --> 03:31:16,520
Thanks Richard.

3827
03:31:17,640 --> 03:31:20,840
Does she refer to the awful kids down the street as les enfants terribles?

3828
03:31:22,200 --> 03:31:23,360
I should tell her to.

3829
03:31:24,260 --> 03:31:25,760
Mom, you should learn French.

3830
03:31:27,920 --> 03:31:30,980
We have 2000 commands you guys.

3831
03:31:32,480 --> 03:31:33,920
You can call me...

3832
03:31:37,110 --> 03:31:38,270
Dominant.

3833
03:31:44,730 --> 03:31:46,470
Second floor.

3834
03:31:51,770 --> 03:31:53,930
Because I'm a dominant.

3835
03:31:55,450 --> 03:31:56,170
Do you get it?

3836
03:31:59,490 --> 03:32:02,570
And before big boss appears and says kept you waiting, huh?

3837
03:32:07,670 --> 03:32:09,210
Ok, Rio's room.

3838
03:32:10,610 --> 03:32:11,010
Oh really?

3839
03:32:11,870 --> 03:32:13,670
I just wanted to look in your room.

3840
03:32:13,910 --> 03:32:14,610
Ok, nevermind.

3841
03:32:15,050 --> 03:32:17,030
She literally goes up and says...

3842
03:32:17,030 --> 03:32:18,790
No, you don't even get to explore.

3843
03:32:21,950 --> 03:32:24,350
Rio doesn't want me to see her secrets.

3844
03:32:25,450 --> 03:32:26,090
Ok, Rio.

3845
03:32:27,650 --> 03:32:28,550
Alright then.

3846
03:32:28,790 --> 03:32:29,870
Go to hallway.

3847
03:32:31,730 --> 03:32:33,850
She is hiding something for real.

3848
03:32:34,250 --> 03:32:35,810
Why does she have a lizard in her room?

3849
03:32:36,810 --> 03:32:38,550
Why does she have a lizard man in her room?

3850
03:32:38,630 --> 03:32:39,150
What happened?

3851
03:32:41,110 --> 03:32:42,850
We should go to...

3852
03:32:42,850 --> 03:32:44,330
Go to warehouse.

3853
03:32:50,130 --> 03:32:50,670
Run.

3854
03:32:53,330 --> 03:32:53,870
Lizard.

3855
03:32:55,310 --> 03:32:55,910
Alrighty.

3856
03:32:57,350 --> 03:32:59,250
After the warehouse...

3857
03:32:59,250 --> 03:33:00,750
Since there was a lot going on in there.

3858
03:33:01,630 --> 03:33:03,450
I imagine then I'll call it.

3859
03:33:06,850 --> 03:33:09,210
The 21st of September.

3860
03:33:24,940 --> 03:33:26,960
Oh we got the night vision!

3861
03:33:27,900 --> 03:33:29,680
Uh oh, we got the night vision.

3862
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:33,840
They were fighting in the dark?

3863
03:33:40,460 --> 03:33:41,140
Yes,

3864
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:45,960
I can see you.

3865
03:33:48,240 --> 03:33:49,760
No, I'm a liar.

3866
03:33:54,960 --> 03:33:56,320
Uh huh.

3867
03:33:56,960 --> 03:33:58,180
Why doesn't she believe me?

3868
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:00,280
Left.

3869
03:34:03,840 --> 03:34:04,420
Again?

3870
03:34:04,580 --> 03:34:05,440
You are testing me again?

3871
03:34:08,940 --> 03:34:09,540
None.

3872
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:11,280
Yep, yep.

3873
03:34:16,240 --> 03:34:16,840
Both.

3874
03:34:21,900 --> 03:34:22,680
Yep, yep.

3875
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:23,940
Yep, yep, yep.

3876
03:34:27,020 --> 03:34:28,580
The entire game is a test.

3877
03:34:30,580 --> 03:34:31,800
Oh my gosh.

3878
03:34:33,480 --> 03:34:34,140
In her mouth!

3879
03:34:35,140 --> 03:34:35,900
Run!

3880
03:34:39,580 --> 03:34:40,480
Enemy 2.

3881
03:34:41,480 --> 03:34:42,300
Enemy 2.

3882
03:34:43,600 --> 03:34:44,240
Tongue.

3883
03:34:45,300 --> 03:34:46,020
In her mouth.

3884
03:34:47,540 --> 03:34:48,280
In her mouth.

3885
03:34:49,260 --> 03:34:49,680
There we go.

3886
03:34:50,360 --> 03:34:50,960
In her mouth.

3887
03:34:51,960 --> 03:34:53,020
In her mouth.

3888
03:34:53,460 --> 03:34:54,220
Nice.

3889
03:34:54,700 --> 03:34:55,560
In her mouth.

3890
03:34:56,480 --> 03:34:57,400
In her mouth.

3891
03:34:58,120 --> 03:34:58,660
Eye.

3892
03:35:00,880 --> 03:35:01,800
In her mouth.

3893
03:35:03,080 --> 03:35:03,900
In her mouth.

3894
03:35:05,780 --> 03:35:06,420
Yes it is.

3895
03:35:06,540 --> 03:35:07,020
In her mouth.

3896
03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:07,380
Eye.

3897
03:35:08,400 --> 03:35:09,460
No, number 2.

3898
03:35:10,620 --> 03:35:11,360
In her mouth.

3899
03:35:12,340 --> 03:35:12,880
Nice.

3900
03:35:13,720 --> 03:35:13,900
OK.

3901
03:35:15,180 --> 03:35:16,580
Oh no, we just got...

3902
03:35:18,220 --> 03:35:19,080
Enemy 3.

3903
03:35:20,140 --> 03:35:21,620
Oh no, enemy... In her mouth.

3904
03:35:22,740 --> 03:35:23,340
In her mouth.

3905
03:35:24,160 --> 03:35:24,880
Yeah, reload.

3906
03:35:26,800 --> 03:35:27,780
Auto fire.

3907
03:35:43,240 --> 03:35:44,580
OK, good, good, good.

3908
03:35:44,680 --> 03:35:44,920
Eye.

3909
03:35:46,520 --> 03:35:47,580

Uh, enemy 2.

In her mouth.

3914
03:35:57,140 --> 03:35:57,640
Oh, reload.

3915
03:36:00,480 --> 03:36:01,440
Ah, in her mouth.

3916
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:08,020
Enemy 1.

3917
03:36:08,980 --> 03:36:09,620
In her mouth.

3918
03:36:10,520 --> 03:36:11,280
In her mouth.

3919
03:36:12,300 --> 03:36:13,540
Yes it is!

03:36:13,740 --> 03:36:14,320
In her mouth.

3921
03:36:15,440 --> 03:36:16,240
Auto fire.

3922
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:18,240
Auto fire.

3923
03:36:20,380 --> 03:36:20,860
Nice.

3924
03:36:21,620 --> 03:36:22,160

3925
03:36:23,140 --> 03:36:23,320

3927
03:36:29,780 --> 03:36:30,360
Nice.

03:36:31,040 --> 03:36:31,800
In her mouth.

3929
03:36:37,940 --> 03:36:39,060
In her mouth.

3930
03:36:40,320 --> 03:36:41,300
Actually aim.

3931
03:36:41,300 --> 03:36:41,700
Eye.

3932
03:36:44,260 --> 03:36:44,800
OK.

3933
03:36:46,880 --> 03:36:49,540
Yeah, no thanks to you.

3934
03:36:53,940 --> 03:36:58,040
Wow, there is a lot going on in here.

3935
03:37:06,090 --> 03:37:07,170
Area A2.

3936
03:37:09,030 --> 03:37:10,950
How does she know if she can't see?

3937
03:37:16,330 --> 03:37:17,210
Again.

3938
03:37:19,070 --> 03:37:19,750
Stomach.

3939
03:37:20,970 --> 03:37:21,750
Stomach.

3940
03:37:22,610 --> 03:37:24,190
Oh, that works too.

3941
03:37:24,590 --> 03:37:25,190

3943
03:37:28,050 --> 03:37:28,690
Auto fire.

3944
03:37:30,810 --> 03:37:31,690
Nevermind.

3945
03:37:32,090 --> 03:37:32,370
Head.

3946
03:37:34,110 --> 03:37:34,770
Auto fire.

3947
03:37:35,810 --> 03:37:36,730
Oh, that works too.

3948
03:37:37,810 --> 03:37:38,690
Reload.

3949
03:37:39,870 --> 03:37:40,210
No!

3950
03:37:41,710 --> 03:37:42,150
Reload.

3951
03:37:42,970 --> 03:37:45,310
I guess healing is fine too though.

3952
03:37:46,930 --> 03:37:47,630
Stomach.

3953
03:37:48,710 --> 03:37:50,070
Head.

3954
03:37:51,650 --> 03:37:52,250

03:37:56,290 --> 03:37:56,690
Nice.

3957
03:37:58,110 --> 03:37:59,270
Stomach.

3958
03:38:00,710 --> 03:38:01,370
Stomach.

3959
03:38:02,870 --> 03:38:03,570
Stomach.

3960
03:38:05,090 --> 03:38:05,990

3961
03:38:07,650 --> 03:38:08,450
Stomach.

3962
03:38:09,450 --> 03:38:12,350
I'm washing.

3963
03:38:13,310 --> 03:38:14,910
I'm watching!

3964
03:38:18,170 --> 03:38:19,410
OK.

3965
03:38:20,990 --> 03:38:22,670
Area A2.

3966
03:38:24,410 --> 03:38:26,130
I don't think we...

3967
03:38:26,130 --> 03:38:26,830
Again?

3968
03:38:28,410 --> 03:38:28,890
Another?

3969
03:38:30,350 --> 03:38:31,410
Oh my gosh, wait.

3970
03:38:31,730 --> 03:38:32,170
Enemy 1.

3971
03:38:32,690 --> 03:38:33,890
Enemy 1.

3972
03:38:34,970 --> 03:38:35,870
Enemy 1.

3973
03:38:36,850 --> 03:38:38,090
Enemy 1.

3974
03:38:38,910 --> 03:38:39,730

03:38:50,390 --> 03:38:52,130
Oh my gosh.

3981
03:38:52,230 --> 03:38:52,630
Run away.

3982
03:38:57,330 --> 03:38:58,050
Stomach.

3983
03:38:59,910 --> 03:39:01,730
Not back.

3984
03:39:02,410 --> 03:39:02,770
Forward.

3985
03:39:02,770 --> 03:39:02,970
Forward.

3986
03:39:05,530 --> 03:39:06,230
Forward?

3987
03:39:07,330 --> 03:39:08,030

Low kick.

3996
03:39:30,810 --> 03:39:31,510

3997
03:39:32,690 --> 03:39:33,690
Stomach.

3998
03:39:35,470 --> 03:39:35,750
Shoot.

3999
03:39:36,670 --> 03:39:37,650
Shoot.

4000

03:55:05,310 --> 03:55:06,010
In her mouth.

4397
03:55:07,090 --> 03:55:07,910
Move right.

4398
03:55:08,790 --> 03:55:09,290
Move right.

4399
03:55:11,410 --> 03:55:12,450
Heal.

4400
03:55:13,410 --> 03:55:14,370
Heal.

4401
03:55:14,610 --> 03:55:15,290
Oh shit, shit.

4402
03:55:15,630 --> 03:55:16,310
Recover.

4403
03:55:16,310 --> 03:55:16,390

4408
03:55:25,970 --> 03:55:27,050
Recover.

4409
03:55:28,790 --> 03:55:29,730
Oh my god.

4410
03:55:30,470 --> 03:55:30,910
Stomach.

4411
03:55:32,170 --> 03:55:32,430
Flee.

4412
03:55:32,950 --> 03:55:34,030
Flee.

4413
03:55:38,090 --> 03:55:39,710
Enemy 1.

4414
03:55:40,670 --> 03:55:41,130
In her mouth.

4415
03:55:42,090 --> 03:55:42,310
Eye.

4416
03:55:43,290 --> 03:55:43,910
In her mouth.

4417
03:55:43,910 --> 03:55:45,330
In her mouth.

4418
03:55:45,710 --> 03:55:46,370
In her mouth.

4419
03:55:46,690 --> 03:55:47,210
In her mouth.

4420
03:55:49,210 --> 03:55:49,890

4421
03:55:52,710 --> 03:55:53,390

4424
03:55:56,410 --> 03:55:56,990
Shoot.

4425
03:55:57,730 --> 03:55:58,410
Shoot.

4426
03:56:01,590 --> 03:56:02,950
Number 2.

4427
03:56:03,930 --> 03:56:04,450
In her mouth.

4428
03:56:05,030 --> 03:56:05,230
Wait.

4429
03:56:05,390 --> 03:56:06,330
No, I didn't mean to say that.

4430
03:56:06,370 --> 03:56:06,590
Sorry.

4431
03:56:07,230 --> 03:56:07,910
Shoot.

4432
03:56:09,090 --> 03:56:09,450

4434
03:56:12,490 --> 03:56:13,530

In her mouth.

4438
03:56:18,410 --> 03:56:19,050
Stomach.

4439
03:56:21,290 --> 03:56:21,930
Shoot.

4440
03:56:22,030 --> 03:56:22,470
And number 3.

4441
03:56:22,790 --> 03:56:23,690
Enemy 3.

4442
03:56:24,090 --> 03:56:24,890
Turn around.

4443
03:56:26,230 --> 03:56:27,130
Turn around.

4444
03:56:29,050 --> 03:56:29,830
In her mouth.

4445
03:56:31,230 --> 03:56:31,670
Shoot.

4446
03:56:32,430 --> 03:56:33,050
Oh my god.

4447
03:56:33,170 --> 03:56:33,590
Oh my god.

4448
03:56:34,990 --> 03:56:35,630
Shoot.

4449
03:56:35,630 --> 03:56:35,810

4451
03:56:43,220 --> 03:56:44,400
Move left.

4452
03:56:45,700 --> 03:56:47,040
Move left.

4453
03:56:48,140 --> 03:56:49,060
Move left.

4454
03:56:50,560 --> 03:56:51,500
In her mouth.

4455
03:56:51,980 --> 03:56:53,300
Move left.

4456
03:56:56,520 --> 03:56:58,640
In her mouth.

4457
03:56:59,040 --> 03:57:00,160
In her mouth.

4458
03:57:09,760 --> 03:57:17,210
I only have 2 health left.

4459
03:57:17,550 --> 03:57:20,130
I used all my heals on that one battle.

4460
03:57:24,210 --> 03:57:28,050
I used all my heals on that one battle.

4461
03:57:34,890 --> 03:57:36,890
She won't do it.

4462
03:57:36,890 --> 03:57:37,290
She sells.

4463
03:57:38,310 --> 03:57:39,290
She sells.

4464
03:57:40,790 --> 03:57:41,830
She will!

4465
03:57:43,110 --> 03:57:43,790
Oh my gosh.

4466
03:57:43,930 --> 03:57:44,150
Please.

4467
03:57:45,350 --> 03:57:45,810
Yes.

4468
03:57:48,770 --> 03:57:49,470
Yes.

4469
03:57:53,270 --> 03:57:57,410
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

4470
03:58:09,290 --> 03:58:10,450
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

4471
03:58:10,650 --> 03:58:12,230
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

4472
03:58:13,770 --> 03:58:14,570
Okay, your turn.

4473
03:58:15,410 --> 03:58:16,890
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

4474
03:58:17,030 --> 03:58:18,250
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

4475
03:58:18,430 --> 03:58:20,030
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

4476
03:58:20,710 --> 03:58:21,150
Awesome!

4477
03:58:23,630 --> 03:58:24,650
Repeat after me.

4478
03:58:26,250 --> 03:58:27,630
I saw Esau kissing Kate.

4479
03:58:27,870 --> 03:58:29,290
Kate saw I saw Esau.

4480
03:58:29,530 --> 03:58:30,870
Esau saw that I saw Kate.

4481
03:58:30,950 --> 03:58:32,310
And Kate saw I saw Esau.

4482
03:58:33,590 --> 03:58:34,570
Okay, your turn.

4483
03:58:35,410 --> 03:58:37,430
I saw Esau kissing Kate.

4484
03:58:37,650 --> 03:58:39,030
Kate saw I saw Esau.

4485
03:58:39,230 --> 03:58:40,770
Esau saw that I saw Kate.

4486
03:58:41,070 --> 03:58:42,610
And Kate saw I saw Esau.

4487
03:59:05,830 --> 03:59:07,030
She sells.

4488
03:59:15,100 --> 03:59:15,700
Oh.

4489
03:59:16,180 --> 03:59:16,720
Yes.

4490
03:59:25,740 --> 03:59:26,820
Okay, your turn.

4491
03:59:31,060 --> 03:59:32,600
Oh, what did she say?

4492
03:59:32,780 --> 03:59:34,640
Sorry, I was checking my DMs.

4493
03:59:37,860 --> 03:59:38,860
The rugged...

4494
03:59:38,860 --> 03:59:43,680
She sells.

4495
03:59:45,180 --> 03:59:46,420
My pencil pleasure.

4496
03:59:47,160 --> 03:59:48,020
Thank you for membership.

4497
03:59:49,320 --> 03:59:49,720
Yes.

4498
03:59:52,480 --> 03:59:54,020
Sorry, I had an important DM.

4499
03:59:56,320 --> 03:59:57,000
Oh.

4500
03:59:59,280 --> 04:00:01,460
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

4501
04:00:05,160 --> 04:00:05,380
Thank you.

4502
04:00:14,440 --> 04:00:16,520
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

4503
04:00:16,840 --> 04:00:18,340
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

4504
04:00:22,200 --> 04:00:22,240
Okay.

4505
04:00:26,940 --> 04:00:28,240
Oh, this is a new one.

4506
04:00:31,780 --> 04:00:32,780
Okay, your turn.

4507
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:33,260
Oh gosh.

4508
04:00:33,940 --> 04:00:36,740
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

4509
04:00:37,100 --> 04:00:40,340
A woodchuck would chuck as much as it could chuck if a woodchuck could.

4510
04:00:47,040 --> 04:00:48,720
I did it!

4511
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:53,100
Okay, we need to do it again.

4512
04:00:53,620 --> 04:00:54,100
Sorry.

4513
04:00:54,100 --> 04:00:55,480
She sells.

4514
04:00:57,660 --> 04:00:58,640
She sells.

4515
04:00:59,720 --> 04:01:00,700
Okay, another one.

4516
04:01:02,200 --> 04:01:02,820
Yes.

4517
04:01:04,400 --> 04:01:04,760
Yes.

4518
04:01:07,320 --> 04:01:08,200
Okay.

4519
04:01:12,440 --> 04:01:12,740
Okay.

4520
04:01:16,060 --> 04:01:19,040
Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran.

4521
04:01:20,340 --> 04:01:20,840
Awesome.

4522
04:01:24,680 --> 04:01:28,780
A big black bug bit a big blue bug and the big blue bug bled black blood.

4523
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:29,720
This is a new one too.

4524
04:01:29,820 --> 04:01:30,260
Oh gosh.

4525
04:01:30,480 --> 04:01:37,240
A big black bug bit a big blue bug and the big blue bug bled black blood.

4526
04:01:39,680 --> 04:01:41,340
Why do you sound so desperate?

4527
04:01:41,480 --> 04:01:42,640
Because we need to heal.

4528
04:01:45,440 --> 04:01:48,000
This is how you heal in the game.

4529
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:52,520
Well, this is how you heal without the... without the... what's it called?

4530
04:01:53,140 --> 04:01:54,600
The health packs.

4531
04:01:56,500 --> 04:01:59,280
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

4532
04:01:59,440 --> 04:02:01,900
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

4533
04:02:02,280 --> 04:02:06,920
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

4534
04:02:07,640 --> 04:02:09,420
Oh my gosh, I'm spitting everywhere.

4535
04:02:13,180 --> 04:02:13,560
Yippee!

4536
04:02:14,480 --> 04:02:17,700
I flubbed, but it's not as bad as the ESAW, I guess.

4537
04:02:18,580 --> 04:02:19,320
Okay, you know what?

4538
04:02:19,340 --> 04:02:20,480
That should be fine, maybe.

4539
04:02:22,320 --> 04:02:27,820
I know we're about to get ambushed again because there's so much time... or so much space to Area C2.

4540
04:02:29,720 --> 04:02:30,100
So...

4541
04:02:30,100 --> 04:02:30,600
Oh...

4542
04:02:32,140 --> 04:02:33,260
Oh...

4543
04:02:33,260 --> 04:02:39,240
And we only have two more health.

4544
04:02:40,360 --> 04:02:41,160
Two more health.

4545
04:02:41,780 --> 04:02:42,760
Splash zone.

4546
04:02:44,900 --> 04:02:46,420
Okay, alright.

4547
04:02:47,460 --> 04:02:49,100
Go to Area C2.

4548
04:02:52,060 --> 04:02:53,180
Oh.

4549
04:02:54,680 --> 04:02:55,400
Oh what?

4550
04:02:56,260 --> 04:02:57,200
What light?

4551
04:03:01,760 --> 04:03:02,360
Oh.

4552
04:03:05,100 --> 04:03:06,200
It's all lit up.

4553
04:03:06,220 --> 04:03:06,920
What are you talking about?

4554
04:03:07,440 --> 04:03:08,760
All lights are currently turned off.

4555
04:03:09,760 --> 04:03:10,000
On.

4556
04:03:14,790 --> 04:03:16,810
Maybe leave the room and save.

4557
04:03:17,730 --> 04:03:18,390
Oh, true.

4558
04:03:20,550 --> 04:03:21,750
Oh my god!

4559
04:03:26,090 --> 04:03:27,410
Are those people?

4560
04:03:27,950 --> 04:03:28,890
Are they aliens?

4561
04:03:31,730 --> 04:03:32,590
Metal gear.

4562
04:03:32,750 --> 04:03:33,910
They look like sneaky suits.

4563
04:03:33,910 --> 04:03:35,910
What?

4564
04:03:57,910 --> 04:04:01,230
He sounds radical.

4565
04:04:01,980 --> 04:04:03,170
Oh my gosh.

4566
04:04:04,290 --> 04:04:05,550
What the hell?

4567
04:04:20,990 --> 04:04:22,630
Talking about the room?

4568
04:04:25,330 --> 04:04:26,670
Just shoot him now.

4569
04:04:28,590 --> 04:04:29,190
Just shoot him.

4570
04:04:39,790 --> 04:04:40,550
Oh.

4571
04:04:41,910 --> 04:04:42,130
Oh.

4572
04:04:55,130 --> 04:04:57,390
They just had to make it exaggerated.

4573
04:04:58,610 --> 04:04:59,510
So evil.

4574
04:05:07,190 --> 04:05:08,130
Oh.

4575
04:05:09,230 --> 04:05:10,170
Oh.

4576
04:05:10,490 --> 04:05:11,690
Oh hell yeah.

4577
04:05:14,120 --> 04:05:15,830
Oh hell yeah.

4578
04:05:19,190 --> 04:05:20,370
What is that thing?

4579
04:05:22,730 --> 04:05:23,810
Oh yeah!

4580
04:05:26,140 --> 04:05:27,690
I think we should leave.

4581
04:05:31,230 --> 04:05:32,250
I think we should go.

4582
04:05:44,550 --> 04:05:46,150
She's so hot.

4583
04:05:48,830 --> 04:05:51,130
Should I stay or should I go?

4584
04:05:51,810 --> 04:05:53,910
My heart is conflicted.

4585
04:05:57,790 --> 04:05:58,970
Don't touch me!

4586
04:06:00,610 --> 04:06:03,910
Our guns are useless against it.

4587
04:06:06,450 --> 04:06:06,970
Um...

4588
04:06:06,970 --> 04:06:08,370
Oh, me?

4589
04:06:11,290 --> 04:06:12,330
What should...

4590
04:06:12,330 --> 04:06:14,250
I'm gonna say run.

4591
04:06:14,930 --> 04:06:15,370
Run!

4592
04:06:19,870 --> 04:06:20,390
Seduce.

4593
04:06:22,350 --> 04:06:25,610
I would've done it for the bit, but I'm too afraid of dying.

4594
04:06:27,250 --> 04:06:29,610
I would've absolutely done it for the bit.

4595
04:06:30,110 --> 04:06:32,210
But you guys, I'm not doing that room again!

4596
04:06:34,410 --> 04:06:36,010
You can't make me!

4597
04:06:39,190 --> 04:06:40,630
Health pack.

4598
04:06:44,610 --> 04:06:46,050
I am.

4599
04:06:46,430 --> 04:06:49,570
I think we found our girlfriend.

4600
04:06:50,390 --> 04:06:50,710
Naomi.

4601
04:06:52,130 --> 04:06:52,850
Wait,

4602
04:06:56,040 --> 04:06:56,520
wait, wait, wait, wait.

4603
04:06:58,080 --> 04:06:59,720
Go to area A.

4604
04:06:59,720 --> 04:07:01,340
Area A, okay.

4605
04:07:03,800 --> 04:07:05,120
I need to find a save point stat.

4606
04:07:06,840 --> 04:07:08,140
One second, you guys too.

4607
04:07:22,200 --> 04:07:23,460
Hold on, sorry.

4608
04:07:23,460 --> 04:07:23,520
Sorry.

4609
04:07:34,260 --> 04:07:36,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

4610
04:07:36,280 --> 04:07:37,060
Where are we going?

4611
04:07:40,180 --> 04:07:41,680
Go to area C.

4612
04:07:42,280 --> 04:07:43,340
Area C, okay.

4613
04:07:44,160 --> 04:07:44,860
You see a save point?

4614
04:07:44,980 --> 04:07:45,440
Wait, wait, wait.

4615
04:07:46,000 --> 04:07:46,740
Save point!

4616
04:07:49,860 --> 04:07:51,440
I think you guys saved me.

4617
04:07:51,580 --> 04:07:51,880
Run!

4618
04:07:52,240 --> 04:07:52,600
Yes.

4619
04:07:52,940 --> 04:07:54,060
Oh my gosh, you guys saved me.

4620
04:07:54,100 --> 04:07:55,140
You guys saved me for real.

4621
04:07:58,880 --> 04:07:59,620
Save point.

4622
04:08:05,200 --> 04:08:05,620
Wait,

4623
04:08:09,950 --> 04:08:10,290
hold on.

4624
04:08:12,270 --> 04:08:12,910
No, wait.

4625
04:08:13,070 --> 04:08:13,590
I'm so stupid.

4626
04:08:13,690 --> 04:08:14,890
I don't want to go through that room again.

4627
04:08:15,090 --> 04:08:17,190
I was gonna try and seduce the lady.

4628
04:08:19,670 --> 04:08:20,370
It's okay.

4629
04:08:21,870 --> 04:08:23,450
We are in save point 2 now.

4630
04:08:23,450 --> 04:08:23,710
No.

4631
04:08:27,730 --> 04:08:28,430
Me.

4632
04:08:28,770 --> 04:08:30,370
Me after that room.

4633
04:08:33,250 --> 04:08:35,450
You know Rio, you know what would make me feel better?

4634
04:08:36,030 --> 04:08:37,210
Do a sexy pose.

4635
04:08:42,370 --> 04:08:43,770
Zoom in.

4636
04:08:53,790 --> 04:08:55,820
You all are so welcome.

4637
04:08:55,820 --> 04:08:58,260
You're welcome.

4638
04:08:59,160 --> 04:09:02,480
You guys say that I'm mean to you, but aren't I nice to you?

4639
04:09:04,600 --> 04:09:05,440
Zoom in.

4640
04:09:09,320 --> 04:09:12,180
I give you all the best fan service, do I not?

4641
04:09:15,660 --> 04:09:16,640
Turn around.

4642
04:09:17,860 --> 04:09:18,440
Turn around.

4643
04:09:19,140 --> 04:09:20,040
Turn around.

4644
04:09:20,880 --> 04:09:21,440
Stop.

4645
04:09:22,660 --> 04:09:23,540
Zoom in.

4646
04:09:31,910 --> 04:09:33,370
Look at you guys.

4647
04:09:33,430 --> 04:09:33,750
Okay.

4648
04:09:34,690 --> 04:09:37,950
Actually, now that I think about it, no one called that a fart window.

4649
04:09:38,650 --> 04:09:41,030
Only when it comes to me is it a fart window.

4650
04:09:43,150 --> 04:09:44,030
Zoom in.

4651
04:09:44,650 --> 04:09:46,970
That is literally what that is.

4652
04:09:48,810 --> 04:09:49,690
And yet...

4653
04:09:49,690 --> 04:09:50,730
Do a sexy pose.

4654
04:09:52,770 --> 04:09:53,430
Zoom in.

4655
04:09:53,590 --> 04:09:53,830
Zoom in.

4656
04:09:53,970 --> 04:09:54,350
Zoom in.

4657
04:09:54,570 --> 04:09:54,910
Zoom in.

4658
04:09:54,910 --> 04:09:55,230
PNG.

4659
04:09:58,710 --> 04:10:00,630
Rio, wear a PNG dress.

4660
04:10:01,110 --> 04:10:01,250
Stop.

4661
04:10:05,070 --> 04:10:05,550
Fartome?

4662
04:10:05,610 --> 04:10:05,850
No!

4663
04:10:06,290 --> 04:10:07,470
That's not my name.

4664
04:10:07,650 --> 04:10:08,650
I'm not a fart.

4665
04:10:08,950 --> 04:10:10,030
I'm a phantom.

4666
04:10:10,790 --> 04:10:12,570
Well, not even a phantom, but you know.

4667
04:10:12,650 --> 04:10:13,590
I'm a ghost.

4668
04:10:15,110 --> 04:10:16,290
I'm a ghost.

4669
04:10:18,250 --> 04:10:19,710
Don't get it wrong.

4670
04:10:20,470 --> 04:10:21,470
We do burn hats.

4671
04:10:22,170 --> 04:10:23,750
Can Mint do a sexy pose?

4672
04:10:25,130 --> 04:10:26,930
I don't even know how to be sexy.

4673
04:10:27,990 --> 04:10:29,270
Is that a sexy pose?

4674
04:10:29,950 --> 04:10:32,810
Oh, is that really a sexy pose?

4675
04:10:32,970 --> 04:10:35,910
I mean, I guess Senchou does it, so...

4676
04:10:37,770 --> 04:10:38,910
It has to be sexy.

4677
04:10:39,010 --> 04:10:39,850
She's very sexy.

4678
04:10:43,350 --> 04:10:46,970
After spending enough time with Rio, I cannot be freaky about her.

4679
04:10:47,070 --> 04:10:48,170
I can't force it.

4680
04:10:50,270 --> 04:11:01,710
Being freaky about Rio is like being freaky about a white piece of paper.

4681
04:11:04,450 --> 04:11:06,250
It's like...

4682
04:11:06,250 --> 04:11:08,030
There's just...

4683
04:11:08,030 --> 04:11:11,610
The only thing she's got is sass, you know?

4684
04:11:12,470 --> 04:11:13,370
Elaborate.

4685
04:11:13,370 --> 04:11:18,510
Well, she'll give you a paper cut with her sass, and then there's just nothing else there.

4686
04:11:20,290 --> 04:11:21,410
There's just...

4687
04:11:23,190 --> 04:11:25,370
That's... I... I just...

4688
04:11:25,890 --> 04:11:27,510
Basically, you...

4689
04:11:27,510 --> 04:11:28,290
What?

4690
04:11:28,630 --> 04:11:30,550
Are you saying I have no personality?

4691
04:11:32,690 --> 04:11:36,890
And that I can only take orders, and I can't do anything for myself?

4692
04:11:41,250 --> 04:11:42,370
What is this?

4693
04:11:52,060 --> 04:11:53,320
Aren't there any instructions?

4694
04:12:01,000 --> 04:12:03,580
Mint is a white girl, not white paper.

4695
04:12:04,060 --> 04:12:05,840
I'm sorry, I'm a ghost.

4696
04:12:06,340 --> 04:12:10,420
That I have white hair and, you know...

4697
04:12:10,720 --> 04:12:11,880
Give her instructions?

4698
04:12:17,790 --> 04:12:19,270
What's camera check again?

4699
04:12:19,330 --> 04:12:19,890
I don't remember.

4700
04:12:20,310 --> 04:12:21,710
Oh yeah, there is microphone check.

4701
04:12:23,070 --> 04:12:24,230
Aren't there any instructions?

4702
04:12:24,230 --> 04:12:24,410
Instructions?

4703
04:12:29,530 --> 04:12:29,990
Anyway...

4704
04:12:33,510 --> 04:12:34,790
Vtuber wink now.

4705
04:12:35,130 --> 04:12:36,930
You can't tell me what to do!

4706
04:12:39,050 --> 04:12:41,710
I won't wink for you, for your satisfaction!

4707
04:12:42,910 --> 04:12:43,470
Spin gun?

4708
04:12:43,550 --> 04:12:45,330
You can only do that in battle, unfortunately.

4709
04:12:46,570 --> 04:12:48,170
Also, we have a big gun now.

4710
04:12:48,210 --> 04:12:48,910
How do we spin it?

4711
04:12:50,710 --> 04:12:53,950
Remember, as janky as Lifeline is...

4712
04:12:53,950 --> 04:12:57,110
It will never be the level of frustration that is Hey You Pikachu.

4713
04:12:58,050 --> 04:12:59,570
And it's even jankier, Mike.

4714
04:13:02,050 --> 04:13:07,730
I think this is probably more frustrating because it's more... it's life or death.

4715
04:13:09,110 --> 04:13:09,850
You know?

4716
04:13:10,890 --> 04:13:17,290
From what I watch of the stream, I feel like being freaky about Rio might be ethically dubious considering how she follows directions.

4717
04:13:18,090 --> 04:13:20,950
I mean, she also wants to go to the bed all the time, so...

4718
04:13:22,690 --> 04:13:23,670
I don't know.

4719
04:13:24,470 --> 04:13:28,970
Great job getting past some tough bosses such as the spider, the bathroom, and Gustave's room.

4720
04:13:29,310 --> 04:13:30,410
Have a good night!

4721
04:13:38,930 --> 04:13:45,910
I think I'm tired for now, guys, but thank you for more, Lifeline.

4722
04:13:46,250 --> 04:13:50,270
This was... this was questionably fun.

4723
04:13:51,710 --> 04:13:55,570
No, I am... I am getting very frustrated, but I am having fun.

4724
04:13:55,570 --> 04:13:57,970
How far am I in the game now?

4725
04:13:58,330 --> 04:14:00,130
I think, what, was that part three, probably?

4726
04:14:01,910 --> 04:14:03,050
Oh, there's no white paper.

4727
04:14:06,370 --> 04:14:07,250
Where are we?

4728
04:14:07,970 --> 04:14:09,590
I'm gonna check the guide.

4729
04:14:11,610 --> 04:14:12,490
Thanks, TriPrincess!

4730
04:14:13,290 --> 04:14:14,290
Oh, thank you!

4731
04:14:25,870 --> 04:14:26,970
It's fun to watch.

4732
04:14:27,030 --> 04:14:30,410
I'm sorry, I feel like I'm shouting in you guys' ears the entire time.

4733
04:14:30,450 --> 04:14:34,030
I'm like, shout, shout, shout, because I'm getting so heated.

4734
04:14:34,490 --> 04:14:35,730
I need her to listen to me.

4735
04:14:36,090 --> 04:14:38,890
I feel like I'm yelling in you guys' ears, I'm sorry.

4736
04:14:43,350 --> 04:14:46,630
It's so loud, so I'm like yelling over myself, too.

4737
04:14:49,730 --> 04:14:50,590
Anyway, hold on.

4738
04:14:55,570 --> 04:14:56,790
This guide kind of sucks.

4739
04:14:58,830 --> 04:15:00,430
This guide is not... wait.

4740
04:15:01,190 --> 04:15:02,730
Can you hear me?

4741
04:15:02,750 --> 04:15:04,250
Can you hear me?

4742
04:15:04,490 --> 04:15:05,070
Oh, wait!

4743
04:15:06,430 --> 04:15:08,510
I think we might be, actually...

4744
04:15:08,510 --> 04:15:12,190
Not so far left of it, I think.

4745
04:15:12,870 --> 04:15:14,750
Shabir, thanks for the dono!

4746
04:15:15,770 --> 04:15:17,190
MintoGaming, you persevered.

4747
04:15:17,330 --> 04:15:18,490
Boss, this is why you're the best.

4748
04:15:19,530 --> 04:15:23,690
From what it seems like, we got through the control staff, service staff, warehouse...

4749
04:15:23,690 --> 04:15:25,690
I think maybe...

4750
04:15:28,690 --> 04:15:29,130
Maybe...

4751
04:15:29,790 --> 04:15:33,710
Next stream, we could endurance it a little bit.

4752
04:15:35,050 --> 04:15:35,830
So, yeah.

4753
04:15:36,630 --> 04:15:38,210
The clothing change was about halfway.

4754
04:15:38,510 --> 04:15:40,090
Ah, okay, so we're over halfway.

4755
04:15:40,810 --> 04:15:41,750
Nice, nice, nice.

4756
04:15:41,770 --> 04:15:42,770
Another stream or two.

4757
04:15:43,010 --> 04:15:44,570
We'll see how I'm feeling next time.

4758
04:15:45,230 --> 04:15:45,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4759
04:15:46,130 --> 04:15:49,470
Good stuff.

4760
04:15:49,990 --> 04:15:51,050
Good stuff, good stuff.

4761
04:15:51,050 --> 04:15:52,590
The final boss was Gustav.

4762
04:15:52,810 --> 04:15:54,750
Honestly, that took so much time.

4763
04:15:55,130 --> 04:15:58,190
That took an egregious amount of time for me.

4764
04:16:08,290 --> 04:16:09,670
Okay, I gotta go.

4765
04:16:13,150 --> 04:16:14,550
