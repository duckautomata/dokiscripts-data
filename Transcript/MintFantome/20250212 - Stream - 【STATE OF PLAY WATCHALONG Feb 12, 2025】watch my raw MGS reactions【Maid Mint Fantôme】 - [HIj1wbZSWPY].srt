1
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,340
Hello, hello, hello!

2
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,980
Welcome back!

3
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,600
My master, my lady, my...

4
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,440
Hello, hello, hello!

5
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,420
Oh, jeez.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,320
Oh, jeez.

7
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm okay!

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,600
Hello!

9
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,880
As you can see, we have a little timer here.

10
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,720
We've got nine minutes!

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,200
Nine minutes until...

12
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,940
Start time was fast.

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,400
I got... Wait, did I even tweet?

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,320
I have to be fast.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,500
Or else...

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,800
You only have a little bit of time before it starts.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,960
Maybe I didn't.

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,260
Maybe I didn't tweet.

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:28,980
Oops.

20
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,100
One second.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,600
Wanted.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,300
I almost mistyped.

23
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,800
Anyway, how are you guys today?

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,720
It's kind of cozy.

25
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,440
Another state of play, another ace combat coping.

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,440
We don't know.

27
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,340
There might be something.

28
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,660
A crumb!

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,760
They're pretty outnumbered though.

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,840
I think everybody is winning.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,160
Everything...

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,600
Everybody is wanting Bloodborne.

33
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,040
Oh my god!

34
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,070
It's like those YouTube timers.

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,610
It's like those YouTube countdowns.

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,890
Oh my gosh.

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,570
Okay, hold on.

38
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,930
Okay, one second.

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,790
Let me turn...

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,030
Oh my gosh.

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,270
Got jump scared for real.

42
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,470
Holy moly.

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
What is this soundtrack?

44
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,760
Nevermind.

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,080
PP music over here.

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
I don't want to listen to it.

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,240
We'll listen to my own music until we...

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,140
Until it's time.

49
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,680
And then of course I'm going to make the screen bigger and everything.

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,040
So don't worry about it.

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,840
If you're like, it's too small.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,320
I'll make it bigger and I'll get rid of my advertisements.

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't worry.

54
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,300
I have to show them off like at least once a month.

55
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,920
I have to show them off at least once a month because I never go on my chattings to the maid cafe really.

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,680
YouTube countdown jump scare.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,440
I know.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,900
Thank you for 10 months.

59
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,620
Dude, where's my music?

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,080
There we go.

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,380
Minto, since Valentine's Day coming up, do you want to be my Valentine?

62
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,580
Fill out the form.

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,020
Do the summoning spell.

64
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,860
Then we'll see, I guess.

65
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,660
Bye, bye, bye.

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,680
MGS Bloodborne Ace Combat, knack three, baby.

67
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,320
What are you hoping for at the show?

68
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,060
I just want to hear anything.

69
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,040
Metal Gear.

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,080
It might be all the same stuff that kind of got leaked-ish, but it's still exciting to see.

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,720
It's still exciting to see.

72
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,580
I don't know.

73
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,760
I want Bloodborne just so that people will shut up.

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,660
It's funny because...

75
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,380
Why are people leaking?

76
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,360
Oh, well, it's like hard to say.

77
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:36,980
Like, rather, it's a leak in that it was from the PlayStation store, you know?

78
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,280
So it wasn't exactly like...

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,360
I work for the company and I link this stuff.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,920
It was like just that it showed up on the PlayStation store.

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,640
But...

82
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,180
Yeah.

83
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,240
Astro Bot 2?

84
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,320
Oh my gosh.

85
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,580
Wait, Astro Bot DLC would go insane.

86
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,860
Some more Astro Bot DLC, please.

87
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,220
Thank you.

88
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,280
Thank you, thank you.

89
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,620
Yeah, they should have like a game of the year Astro Bot DLC.

90
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,700
Hoping for trippy Death Stranding trailers.

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
You know...

92
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,980
Also, hello everyone.

93
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,280
I thought about Death Stranding 2.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,320
Well, ha, get it?

95
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,620
I mean, as in also.

96
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,840
But...

97
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,260
I know that Kojima's gonna be a South by Southwest, which I was like, oh my gosh, I should go.

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,260
I should see if I can go and go to his panel.

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
But then, I'm gonna be in Japan at the time.

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,680
So...

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,820
Sad, sad.

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,140
Dang it.

103
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,400
Dang it.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,460
Otherwise, I was gonna go.

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,640
But...

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,560
Ace Combat and Ace Combat.

107
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,260
I know, I was like, oh my gosh, Kojima's gonna be in my neighborhood.

108
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,260
But...

109
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,420
Actually, I've never been to South by Southwest, so I don't know anything.

110
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,860
Ace Combat, anything, please.

111
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,560
It's the 30th.

112
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,660
Oh my gosh, wait.

113
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh, we have more than one.

114
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,300
I would love more Ace Combat.

115
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
I mean, we heard that.

116
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,340
Hold on, let me fix my chair.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Ouch.

118
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,860
We heard that the Ace Combat devs were...

119
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,960
At the Hornet, so...

120
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,660
Bento's state of play.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,640
Oh, Kiwawa.

122
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,220
Alright, oh.

123
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,680
OMG, hello, cutie.

124
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,740
Hi, cutie.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Hi.

126
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,040
Oh, Kiwawa, are you...

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
Are you wanting any...

128
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,940
Are you...

129
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,440
Do you have any hopes, any kibou for...

130
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,020
State of play today?

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,920
I'm surprised.

132
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,040
I feel like it's kind of...

133
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,860
Late in the day.

134
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,820
I feel like usually it's quite earlier.

135
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,220
But...

136
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,600
Or rather, other directs.

137
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,440
I have no idea why Animal Crossing.

138
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,220
I'm a jork.

139
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,520
Oh, she's jorking it, you guys.

140
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,600
She's just...

141
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,900
She's just jorking it, okay?

142
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,140
Ace...

143
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,240
Crumb of Ace Combat.

144
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,180
Ace Combat!

145
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,580
11 p.m.

146
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:10,900
here.

147
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,840
Yeah, it's so late!

148
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,140
At least the Nintendo ones are like...

149
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,280
Early, early in the morning.

150
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,860
Which makes it kind of...

151
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,120
Late in Japan, but...

152
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,900
From what I know, they've been going to America...

153
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,120
To do research about aviation.

154
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,540
Since the first Ace Combat.

155
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,600
There are planes.

156
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,880
Oh, I didn't know that.

157
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,620
What are we getting?

158
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,300
Minto Astro Bot DLC?

159
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,960
Oh my gosh.

160
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm already in the game.

161
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,220
You know, I'm...

162
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,480
My spirit is there.

163
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,020
The ever-growing list gets larger for the Wisp Valentine's requests.

164
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,800
Should we just make a Wisp fund for things like this?

165
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,540
Fund?

166
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,740
No, I'll put up a thing today...

167
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,800
For you guys to fill out for Valentine's.

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,620
Kingdom Hearts news.

169
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,500
Oh my gosh.

170
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,360
I think I saw Leah saying that she wanted Kingdom Hearts news too.

171
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,740
Yeah.

172
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,780
When are we getting more Kingdom Hearts news?

173
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,320
Maybe today?

174
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,900
Probably not.

175
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,820
If we get Kingdom Hearts news today, I'll eat my foot.

176
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,540
Playing nerd.

177
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,980
Oh, I thought you were making a joke, Nan.

178
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,740
Def going to South by Southwest.

179
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,100
Last time I went, I was to see my rapper friend perform.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
Now gonna see the goat Kojima.

181
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,680
Stop!

182
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,900
Stop bragging to me!

183
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,060
FOMO.

184
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,180
I have FOMO.

185
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,460
New Sly Cooper game.

186
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,440
I feel like we could get so much...

187
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
So many cool things.

188
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,460
Especially if it's like, you know...

189
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,100
Astro Bot reviving the love of certain franchise.

190
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,540
Well, I'm saying Astro Bot.

191
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,300
You know what I mean?

192
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,380
Like, there were certain franchises featured in Astro Bot that you're like, Whoa!

193
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:00,940
So...

194
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,460
You know.

195
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,900
It could be.

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
So many things.

197
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,680
Akiba Strip news.

198
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,140
I don't think they will do that here.

199
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,520
But Akiba Strip, I think, is kind of dead.

200
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,180
Also, we only have two minutes.

201
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Or yeah, two minutes.

202
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,880
Akiba Strip.

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,020
So there was a game after Akiba Strip 2.

204
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,840
That was Akiba's Beat.

205
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,440
And it basically got rid of all the...

206
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,440
Fun, like, advertisement stuff in it.

207
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,000
I guess they did not have the money for the licensing.

208
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,940
And so, it's just...

209
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,680
It's just not...

210
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,360
It's just...

211
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
We can pretend that didn't happen.

212
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,340
I didn't even...

213
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,240
I didn't even play it, honestly.

214
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,560
I was like...

215
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,360
Kind of disappointed.

216
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,080
Mint Metal Gear Collab wins.

217
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,800
If only.

218
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,620
Give us a full-on Ape Escape remake, you cow...

219
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

220
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,920
Hey, hey, know enough about MGS3 remake.

221
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,440
Hey, hey, hey.

222
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

223
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,460
Hey, hey.

224
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,720
We can have both.

225
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,560
Why are we throwing one to the side?

226
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,460
Metal Gear Kingdom Hearts Collab.

227
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,220
No, please.

228
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,740
My brain rots.

229
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,700
I would cut off my pinky finger for Bloodborne 2.

230
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,180
It's funny.

231
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,060
I was supposed to play Bloodborne this week.

232
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,100
I was gonna do it for Valentine's Day.

233
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,300
You know.

234
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,320
But I was just like, I don't know if I should start something.

235
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,860
Okay, hold on.

236
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,460
Let me get ready with my...

237
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,240
Let's get rid of my menu.

238
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,040
Let's make me small.

239
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,320
Move me over here.

240
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,680
Let's get bigger.

241
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,050
Scoot over a little bit more.

242
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,930
We're ready for it.

243
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,030
Oh, what the heck?

244
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,910
Why am I cut off?

245
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,250
There we go.

246
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,250
I'm ready, Freddy.

247
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,530
Legend of Dragoon.

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay, my music.

249
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,340
Go away.

250
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,200
No music.

251
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,010
Who's Freddy?

252
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,550
Freddy is what your mom called me last night.

253
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,290
Oh my gosh.

254
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,090
It's really... I'm premature.

255
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,450
Scary.

256
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,730
I'm trying to determine the music levels.

257
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,410
Oh, Monster Hunter?

258
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,830
I had no idea just how big the world is.

259
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,690
Is this Monster Hunter?

260
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,110
They don't look anime.

261
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,160
Wild.

262
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,680
Oh.

263
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,500
You can...

264
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,160
The Monster Hunter monsters have such like a specific look about them, I feel, you know?

265
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,040
So I feel like it's quite...

266
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,360
When you see them, you're like, oh yeah, that's a Monster Hunter monster.

267
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,420
But the people...

268
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,360
Now that I think about it, I only know what the cats look like in that series.

269
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,800
I don't know what the people look like in that series.

270
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,540
The cats are so cute though.

271
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,120
I think I was supposed to get a Monster Hunter PR pack.

272
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,980
I wonder if that's still coming.

273
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,290
The bit rate...

274
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,610
Wait, is it on?

275
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,390
Oh, I can do 4K!

276
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,310
Let's go.

277
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,590
Sorry, it's a little...

278
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,050
If I'm a little behind.

279
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:06,830
Cats!

280
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,250
They're so cute!

281
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,310
Monster Hunter Wild.

282
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,550
That's like so soon.

283
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,980
Spring 2025.

284
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,520
Water.

285
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,000
Water.

286
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,460
Congratulations to everybody.

287
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,700
You can be so dapper.

288
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,780
Oh, I love art books.

289
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,840
What gaming platform do you main or are you a jack of all trades?

290
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,300
Maybe I'd like to be jack of all trades because I don't want to limit myself.

291
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,620
We will keep you updated on the title update plan, so please look forward to future information.

292
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,460
We are waiting for the title to be released on February 28th.

293
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,900
We are waiting for you to enjoy it.

294
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,680
I don't need to be a master of anything.

295
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,660
I just want to have fun.

296
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,900
I need to hi-chat.

297
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,300
Hello!

298
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Yeah!

299
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,620
State of play!

300
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,900
Master of what?

301
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,280
Sega!

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,360
Sonic?

303
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:56,720
No.

304
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,000
Wait, is this actually Shinobi?

305
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,780
I like the art style.

306
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,680
I like the art style a lot, actually.

307
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,340
I like the art style a lot, actually.

308
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,160
It looks fun.

309
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,520
Is this a remaster or a remake?

310
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,860
It was announced a bit ago.

311
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,780
Oh, okay, okay.

312
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,920
Sega's booking?

313
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,440
I feel like a lot of...

314
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,000
the companies...

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
have been kind of like...

316
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,860
I don't want to say making a comeback, because some of them never really stopped being good, you know, but...

317
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,400
It does feel like we've been getting more effort put into things as of recent, so...

318
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
At least with properties.

319
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:12,950
Revengeance.

320
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,190
Not revengeance.

321
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,810
Vengeance.

322
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,830
Oh!

323
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:20,790
Here's Sonic!

324
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,530
Oh yeah.

325
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,650
Oh, he's styling.

326
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,870
I can't believe it's cool to be a Sonic fan again.

327
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,270
I can't believe that we're back.

328
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,190
I think maybe Sonic healed everything.

329
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,990
Being a Sonic fan...

330
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,710
Having it cool to be a Sonic fan again healed the gaming industry.

331
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,510
Sonic is always cool.

332
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,890
Yeah, why is he in a car?

333
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,070
Let the guy rest his legs a little bit.

334
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,810
It wouldn't be fair.

335
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,130
He would...

336
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,010
Ace Combat!

337
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,350
We got it!

338
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,280
Oh my gosh, these maps are insane.

339
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,070
Ah, cute.

340
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,290
Where?

341
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,490
Look at him.

342
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,270
Cross worlds.

343
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,460
Wishlist now.

344
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,700
Oh, I can sign up on the 21st.

345
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,260
Let's go.

346
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,040
Akiba.

347
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,020
I thought the art style makes this look like...

348
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,900
Akiba!

349
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,600
Oh my god, Akihabara!

350
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,300
What is this?

351
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,940
Digimon?

352
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,020
Digimon?

353
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,460
Oh!

354
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,240
Akuma!

355
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,800
I saw him for like two seconds.

356
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,960
Wait, Patamon?

357
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,480
Where's my baby?

358
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
Oh yeah!

359
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,820
Digimon story.

360
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,960
Time Stranger!

361
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,610
Hello!

362
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,290
Real people.

363
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,090
Digimon story series is super fun.

364
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,990
It looks good.

365
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,710
But, what I was saying earlier is like...

366
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,630
The graphics at first made it look like a...

367
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,050
Like a Genshin game, you know?

368
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,230
Oh my god, Kingdom Hearts.

369
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,430
Isn't that like...

370
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,530
Genshin games have that like...

371
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,290
That type of shading and all.

372
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,910
What does Sora say?

373
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,750
I don't remember.

374
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,630
Oh my...

375
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,630
The bass in my ears!

376
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,730
Oh my god!

377
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,690
Holy deep!

378
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,450
Hot lady.

379
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,230
Red dress?

380
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,370
Why do they sound familiar?

381
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,610
The voice actor sounds familiar.

382
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,530
Prime, is that you?

383
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,990
Peter Cullen?

384
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,730
Must be Optimus Prime?

385
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,590
No way.

386
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,130
Is it Peter Cullen?

387
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:29,750
We must...

388
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,270
I hear it now.

389
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:31,910
I was like...

390
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,910
If it's not, that guy...

391
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,670
That guy could totally do a great...

392
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,650
Optimus Prime.

393
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,750
Lost soul aside...

394
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,170
The guy confused me.

395
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,670
I thought he was gonna be talking about...

396
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,750
The previous game, not this one.

397
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:57,610
Hi!

398
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:57,670
Hi!

399
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,090
Oh!

400
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,990
Like a Dragon!

401
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,850
Sea dog?

402
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,730
Like the streamer?

403
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,690
Oh wow.

404
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,650
No way!

405
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,490
And Diver Diver!

406
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,070
Ichiban's Holiday!

407
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,270
I love Diver Diver!

408
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,650
What the hell?

409
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,170
Oh my god!

410
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,470
What?

411
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,410
A crossover?

412
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,830
What is this?

413
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,070
Portal?

414
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,150
I feel Dave the Diver is so powerful.

415
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,850
They get some wack collage.

416
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,990
Hey man!

417
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,290
Oh my god!

418
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,950
He's here!

419
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:28,950
Oh?

420
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,770
The Island.

421
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,150
Oh!

422
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,650
Triporium?

423
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,870
Oh my god it's Splatoon!

424
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,610
This is just Splatoon!

425
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,770
I'm tearing up.

426
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,270
This is totally rad music.

427
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,870
I love this.

428
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,690
I wanna go to a WWE themed park.

429
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,370
That'd be great!

430
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:21,790
I hate it.

431
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,490
Borderlands 4.

432
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,290
Coming to PS5!

433
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,730
Seth!

434
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,090
I'm ready!

435
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:44,810
Seth.

436
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,710
Let's go!

437
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,710
I

438
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,180
don't really know much about Borderlands.

439
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:08,580
I just know a lot of cosplayers would do the art style.

440
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,520
I like that kind of stuff.

441
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,880
It's kind of similar to Archer.

442
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,560
Keep it that way?

443
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,280
Is it bad?

444
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,380
I always feel like Borderlands was such a beloved series, no?

445
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,100
The first two games were ok.

446
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,700
Alex, welcome to membership!

447
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,180
Thank you!

448
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,940
Yeah, there's no shading.

449
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:36,090
Ok gameplay, bad story.

450
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,030
Maybe they'll redeem themselves.

451
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,430
If the first two games are good, that's only one game that's bad.

452
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,510
Maybe they'll redeem it in the fourth game.

453
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,930
We're a YouTuber?

454
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,310
That's the first thing I thought of too.

455
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,990
This guy's shirt is kind of insane.

456
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,270
It's like a Chinese style polo and then it's got triangles on it.

457
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,750
What is this?

458
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,750
I don't know how to feel about it.

459
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,410
September 23rd!

460
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,730
He's a magician?

461
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,250
Wait, actually?

462
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,410
Is this Tron?

463
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,300
Oh, it takes two again.

464
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,560
I feel like I remember them announcing this.

465
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,260
Tron!

466
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,160
Mega Man!

467
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,240
This is Mega Man cosplay.

468
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,460
So they're just...

469
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,180
They write stories...

470
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,340
And then the stories become... Why are they here?

471
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,800
But they write the stories and then they go into the stories.

472
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,780
Now they're getting arrested in the stories!

473
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,660
What's going on?

474
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,560
Zoe!

475
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,760
Oh no.

476
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,040
But a lot of people like It Takes Two, right?

477
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,720
So it might be a fun co-op game at least.

478
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,900
Split Fiction.

479
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,740
Oh I was going to say, what if one person is playing like the future world?

480
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,380
Oh no!

481
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,640
Oh my god!

482
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:10,860
Wait!

483
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,900
Oh my god!

484
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,940
Oh no, but oh yes!

485
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,780
Oh no, but oh yes!

486
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,140
Oh it's like... Oh my gosh, wait.

487
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,100
Supermassive's take on Alien?

488
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,400
I might be obsessed with this.

489
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,960
Oh my god.

490
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,500
I love these games you guys.

491
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,540
You can't make me hate them.

492
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,420
They'll never make me hate these games.

493
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,180
I was going to say...

494
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,900
The...about the last game...

495
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,900
Was one person plays the future and one person plays the other one at the same time.

496
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,920
That doesn't seem to be the case.

497
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,700
Anyway, whatever.

498
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,320
I got so excited.

499
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,700
It's Bureau Clock and Zero Gravity!

500
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,340
Oh my god!

501
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,510
It's like, yeah, it's like the thing, yeah.

502
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,990
Directive 80, this has been announced a while ago though, I remember.

503
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,410
This has been out, or not out, but... Ok, October 2nd.

504
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,270
Let's go!

505
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,450
No, they announced this a while ago.

506
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,390
It was?

507
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,430
No!

508
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,470
Freddy Fazbears!

509
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,130
Who are these guys?

510
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,470
Who are you?

511
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,690
Who are you?

512
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:35,830
Who are you?

513
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,970
Oh, it looks like the guy from Final Fantasy.

514
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,990
Why am I getting like Bendy Ink Machine vibes from this?

515
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Secret of the Mimic?

516
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,410
Is this Freddy Fazbear?

517
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,530
There was not a single Freddy Fazbear!

518
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,570
Cozy Horror?

519
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:21,230
What?

520
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,250
Where is the cozy part?

521
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,130
In clay?

522
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,890
Look at those designs!

523
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,930
Oh my gosh!

524
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,030
And they have actual gameplay!

525
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,510
Holy moly!

526
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,090
Well, this is not what I expected it to look like at all either.

527
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,050
I expected like a side-scroller.

528
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:52,930
Oh my god!

529
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,350
Where is the cozy?

530
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,510
Cozy!

531
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,490
Where is the cozy?

532
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,530
Where is the cozy?

533
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,660
Oh god!

534
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,740
Oh my god!

535
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,040
Oh my god!

536
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,980
Wow!

537
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,180
This is kind of terrifying.

538
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,360
Where is the cozy?

539
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,860
The Midnight Walk?

540
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,100
Wow!

541
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,140
May 8th!

542
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,600
I like it.

543
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,640
I like it.

544
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
Just a cozy game.

545
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,140
They lied as easily as they breathed.

546
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,200
It feels like the movie 9.

547
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,800
Oh I know!

548
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,260
I never saw that, but I know what you are talking about.

549
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh in PS5!

550
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,160
I can play!

551
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,020
Sorry!

552
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,140
Decoy Octopus!

553
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,960
Wait, this is kind of cute actually.

554
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,960
Sorry, I just...

555
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,020
Oh my god, wait, this is Metal Gear!

556
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,740
What?

557
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,350
What?

558
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,170
What?

559
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,370
Wacky Wacky!

560
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,730
Wacky Wacky!

561
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,650
I'm losing my mind.

562
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,910
Show me Wang Yuanji!

563
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,350
Wang Yuanji, sorry.

564
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,410
I kind of like her a little bit, but I have some colors.

565
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:12,650
This is horrible.

566
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,510
Butchered version of her name.

567
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,770
Wacky Wacky!

568
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,310
What the hell?

569
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,110
Today?

570
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,570
Today?

571
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,330
Hello!

572
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,590
Oh my god!

573
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,910
No way!

574
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,130
I cannot believe that that is Squid Game.

575
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,690
It ended up actually being Metal Gear.

576
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,510
Smash Boom!

577
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,250
Welcome to Battleship.

578
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,790
I like the little icon too, with the characters.

579
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,850
It's kind of cute.

580
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,210
More Onimusha!

581
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,610
Oh my gosh, they say coming to PS5, but is it like... they are not exclusive, it can't be.

582
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,840
But...captured on PC.

583
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,080
Did it say that?

584
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,100
Did I miss that?

585
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,860
That would be so funny.

586
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,700
That's me.

587
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,700
It was at the bottom!

588
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,660
That's nasty.

589
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,280
That's fine.

590
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,340
No, don't talk about my ship like that!

591
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,040
Yes,

592
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,460
my favorite period Japanese word.

593
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,740
Spoken in the ancient times of Nihon...

594
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,770
Yeah!

595
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,610
The Yabe period.

596
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,760
All Onimusha protags are based on real actors.

597
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,320
Oh really?

598
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,200
You get an arm waifu.

599
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,660
Yeah baby!

600
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,540
That's what I'm talking about!

601
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,760
I've watched this trailer like 50 times.

602
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,340
Wait,

603
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,940
he makes the silliest face.

604
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,480
Oh my god, he's such a unit.

605
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,880
Look how thick this man is.

606
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,960
Do you hear me, Snake?

607
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:27,700
Oh my god, they all look so good!

608
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,840
Wait, wait, wait!

609
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,760
When Snake jumps off his face, watch out!

610
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,300
Yeah, aim with the iPad-chan!

611
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:49,540
Yeah!

612
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,760
Oh wait, I forgot about the...Yeah baby!

613
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,920
How could I forget?

614
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,060
The best part.

615
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,920
Oh my god, add more please!

616
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,520
Online!

617
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,720
Online please!

618
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,840
Ah!

619
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:44,840
I have a thousand questions.

620
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,940
What is this?

621
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,260
No, I didn't think it was Ace Combat because the location didn't look so...you know.

622
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,940
What the hell?

623
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,920
It's a sequel to something, right?

624
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,460
Because they are like why did you come back?

625
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,520
Why does he look like Death Stranding almost?

626
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,840
Oh boss!

627
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,180
Oh!

628
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,680
What is this?

629
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,500
Thank you, Mito.

630
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,140
Even though I've seen the trailer so many times, I'm so glad they showed it.

631
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,760
What is it?

632
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,160
Oh, hell is us.

633
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,380
OK

634
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,080
It looks kind of freaky.

635
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,060
I don't know.

636
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,350
Oh wait, is this...is that Lies of Pea?

637
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,830
Lies of Peek?

638
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,830
Oh, I thought it was Mr. Krabs for a second.

639
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,950
Oh my god!

640
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,850
Wow, hi.

641
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:43,410
I keep getting Lies of Pea like fan cam edits in my TikTok.

642
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,770
All the comments are always like Lies of Pea, Lies of Pea.

643
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,500
OK, here it looks...I thought it was like a Souls-like game, right?

644
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,900
Let's go!

645
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,740
Yeah, it is like a game.

646
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,140
Overture!

647
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,420
Base game required.

648
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,500
So it's DLC.

649
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,120
So funny.

650
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,380
What is this?

651
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,660
I was going to say this seems cozy, but the guy literally has a...

652
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,760
Huh?

653
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,700
What?

654
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,460
Oh my god!

655
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,420
It's kind of cozy.

656
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,320
I mean, you blow things up and...

657
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,180
No creation without destruction.

658
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,840
Oh my god!

659
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,400
Tecmo murder!

660
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,820
Dreams of another.

661
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,540
Oh my gosh, that game in VR?

662
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,280
Would probably be so weird.

663
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,440
This is just a...

664
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,140
It's just a rage room.

665
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,300
It's just a rage room.

666
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,180
Take off your hat.

667
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,840
No, you might be bald under there.

668
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,860
Hey everyone, I'm Kristen Zitani and I'm excited to share even more PlayStation news in today's show.

669
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,760
Oh yeah, that's why we're here for.

670
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,560
Why is everything getting VR support?

671
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,760
I don't think I want to actually be in the zombie game.

672
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,140
I don't think I want to live that.

673
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,000
I think I'm ok.

674
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,180
Yay!

675
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,860
Oh it's VRR.

676
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,300
I thought she said VR.

677
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:04,620
Ok.

678
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,160
Oh my god!

679
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,280
Imagine this in VR.

680
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,280
Come on!

681
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,900
Ok.

682
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,020
Oh, Nikkei!

683
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,020
That's not surprising at all actually.

684
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,520
Oh, new outfits!

685
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,700
Well, I know already a handful of people that are very excited about that.

686
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,860
We've got some great PlayStation Plus updates today, starting with game catalog titles arriving on February 18th.

687
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:57,800
Star Wars Jedi Survivor, Topspin 2K25, and launching in a game catalog Lost Records Bloom and Rage from the creators of Life is Strange.

688
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:58,900
Bloomerage.

689
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,420
Do you girls ever see anything weird around these parts?

690
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,980
In this episodic adventure, players will join four high school girls living through the defining summer of their lives.

691
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,440
Why do they keep making coming of age games?

692
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,720
This is just Stranger Things.

693
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,040
That's all they know.

694
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,540
They didn't have a good summer in high school.

695
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,520
They keep wanting to make it recreated in a video game.

696
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,980
Everything is a thing of the...

697
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,620
This feels like mist.

698
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,080
Wait, I'm kind of really into this.

699
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,260
Wait no, show me more!

700
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,880
No, I want to see more!

701
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,920
Ew.

702
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,360
Is it good?

703
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,480
This is such a VTuber game.

704
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,480
Meanwhile, Patapon 3 slides its way into the classics catalog next week.

705
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,340
Pretty.

706
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,040
I can sense it.

707
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,460
As long as it is reforged.

708
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:47,280
The game is pretty.

709
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,440
Wishes.

710
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,000
Jennifer English.

711
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,020
London, close enough, welcome back Bloodborne.

712
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm not gonna lie, for like a second I was like...

713
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:17,940
Gwendolyn.

714
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:19,980
Gwendolyn.

715
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,300
Gwendolyn.

716
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,490
Maybe some people think it's a granny.

717
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,850
Oh no.

718
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,570
Tides of Annihilation.

719
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,150
In development for PS5.

720
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,770
She's so beautiful.

721
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,850
Ok.

722
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,150
That doesn't seem bad.

723
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,090
That's pretty neat.

724
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,520
These noises.

725
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,170
Vulcan!

726
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,790
Vulcan Raven!

727
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,100
Armstead.

728
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,640
Bro sounds like Raiden.

729
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,820
I think it's... I kinda hear it.

730
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,220
Metal Eden.

731
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,880
Welcome back Metal Gear!

732
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,000
I saw like everything and nothing.

733
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,140
Everything and nothing.

734
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,700
Drone.

735
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,240
Pocket drone!

736
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,360
What is it?

737
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,540
And they said build a rocket game.

738
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,860
Did you actually build the rocket?

739
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,300
What?

740
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,360
Oh my God, Detroit become human!

741
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,140
Let's go!

742
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,880
Detroit become rocket!

743
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,020
What if this was actually GTA 6?

744
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:29,910
That would be insane.

745
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:34,170
They have the chance to do the funniest thing right now.

746
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,270
Say GTA 6.

747
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,570
Damn.

748
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,530
Mines...MinesEye.game Hello.

749
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,250
He seems so polite.

750
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,410
He's so...he's standing so tall.

751
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,670
He's so soft spoken.

752
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,990
I know he's really tense.

753
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,330
It's ok buddy, you can relax.

754
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:10,870
Ok.

755
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,930
Thank you!

756
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,450
He's so chill.

757
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,870
The game is like insane.

758
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,570
He's like, hello, welcome to my game, MinesEye.

759
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,950
You can play it later this year.

760
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,490
We get it, you can drive the car.

761
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,710
Ok, you can blow up the car.

762
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,910
You don't have to drive the car, you can run the car.

763
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,250
You can outrun the car.

764
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,770
I can no longer drive the car.

765
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,970
I must now run from the car.

766
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,450
You can beat the car.

767
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:07,710
Transformers!

768
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,010
Robots in disguise.

769
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,390
MinesEye.

770
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,610
Transformers.

771
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,670
Robots in MinesEye.

772
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,210
Detroit become car.

773
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,450
What could it be?

774
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,170
Kingdom Hearts.

775
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,990
Kingdom Hearts!

776
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,790
Death Stranding?

777
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:38,890
Bloodborne?

778
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,790
Peace Combat?

779
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,270
Really?

780
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,390
Oh, so he's a big deal.

781
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,730
Helldivers?

782
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:14,850
Looks like the uniform.

783
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:17,670
Oh my god.

784
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,170
I think you gotta get out of there, buddy.

785
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:20,830
Nevermind.

786
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,030
What?

787
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:39,750
Well, that's actually kind of really awesome looking.

788
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,450
He looks really good.

789
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,690
Like he does not look uncanny video game.

790
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,310
He looks like almost a real actor.

791
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:49,230
It's actually really good looking.

792
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,210
Sarras.

793
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,770
He did not have like a very uncanny look about him.

794
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,390
Come back stronger.

795
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,110
Show me the gameplay.

796
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:23,370
Hey everyone, I'm Gregory Loudon, Creative Director at Housemarque.

797
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:30,690
We are thrilled to announce that our latest game, Sarras, is launching next year on PS5 and enhanced for PS5 Pro.

798
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:35,730
Sarras is the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque gameplay first experience.

799
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:41,310
It's a new single-player IP that builds on Returnal's award-winning third-person action.

800
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:45,470
You play Arjun Devaraj, performed by the brilliant Rahul Kauli.

801
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:53,270
Arjun is a powerful enforcer searching for answers on a hostile, shape-shifting planet haunted by an ominous eclipse.

802
00:56:54,270 --> 00:57:00,650
All of us at Housemarque can't wait to share more about Sarras, with our first look at gameplay coming later this year.

803
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,830
Thanks for watching.

804
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,030
Wow.

805
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,550
I'm actually interested in that one.

806
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,570
It looks kind of spooky.

807
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,050
Is that it?

808
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,530
Oh, Metal Gear!

809
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,150
Hi Snake!

810
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,490
No one more?

811
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,770
Oh, one last thing.

812
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,470
Oh my gosh, Darwin's Paradox.

813
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,270
That's it.

814
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,010
That's it.

815
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,750
Show's over everybody.

816
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,350
Show's over.

817
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,210
No Death Stranding 2?

818
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,550
I didn't think there would be any today.

819
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,190
To be honest.

820
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,770
I think there were some cool games.

821
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,830
A lot of stuff I feel that I already knew about.

822
00:57:55,830 --> 00:58:00,790
Or just like a lot of original titles as well.

823
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,750
A lot of original stuff.

824
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:05,790
Hold on.

825
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,190
Let's see.

826
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,010
Let's go to the recap.

827
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:10,810
Recap.

828
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,390
Recap.

829
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:13,930
Recap.

830
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,590
The Warriors game guys!

831
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,950
Literally right now!

832
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,390
Warriors Abyss.

833
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,770
Warriors Roguelike.

834
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,690
Like the directive.

835
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,050
Metal Gear.

836
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,750
Metal Gear really wasn't a surprise.

837
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,610
Cow Team!

838
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:46,450
Welcome to the membership!

839
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:48,670
Oh no.

840
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:49,730
Petal.

841
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,070
That guy.

842
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:56,550
I feel...let's see.

843
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,030
There was...this little?

844
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,670
I feel like there was so much more.

845
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:02,570
Really?

846
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,690
The Digimon game.

847
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,330
Where is that one?

848
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,070
It's not in here.

849
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,350
I was gonna say there is more, but wait.

850
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,690
Why didn't they...

851
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,690
And the FNAF game.

852
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,310
Yeah, wait.

853
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,430
Why didn't they include all the games at the end?

854
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,050
Wait, I'm so confused.

855
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:34,430
Why not?

856
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:36,930
Glad we got Metal Gear.

857
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,490
Why did you freak out and clap the whole time?

858
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:38,910
I'm sorry.

859
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,190
Did I clap the whole time?

860
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:42,490
I'm sorry.

861
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,380
Oh my gosh.

862
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,740
Literally the meme.

863
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,660
They clapped.

864
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,780
Everybody clapped.

865
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,560
I saw a snake and I clapped.

866
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,160
Oh no!

867
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,520
No way.

868
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,660
Gonzalo, thanks for 10 months!

869
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,040
Overall I feel it was kind of like...

870
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,100
Nothing like super groundbreaking.

871
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,740
Nothing super that people were like...

872
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,900
Except Metal Gear obviously, but...

873
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,840
Why don't they have all the games here?

874
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,580
And Darwin's Paradox.

875
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,320
Everybody is freaking out over that.

876
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,880
When the streamer has no idea how to stop.

877
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,540
There was a lot.

878
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,480
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

879
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,720
I wish it would show us everything.

880
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,620
Like a little recap.

881
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,400
Wait, I went straight to it.

882
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,740
I saw the shaggle hot and I was like wait a minute.

883
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,340
I know.

884
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,020
I know that.

885
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,020
I love that camera.

886
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,100
Wait, that angle is so great.

887
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,500
The shadow on Snake's face.

888
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,860
The philosopher.

889
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,620
Got it.

890
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,320
Yeah, did you find the gun?

891
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,620
I keep pausing at the wrong time.

892
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,600
I want to see his face.

893
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,660
There are so many things going on behind that head.

894
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,520
Colonel Titan security around this game.

895
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,740
Minto is coming to play it.

896
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,560
I'm sure of it.

897
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,660
No Fukura!

898
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,100
Oh my gosh.

899
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,900
Wait, have we seen him?

900
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,200
Where is Sokolove?

901
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,220
Look at this guy.

902
01:01:59,240 --> 01:01:59,980
I'm telling you.

903
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,060
I'm telling you.

904
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,520
He is like 20 cursors wide.

905
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:08,640
They have made him like... He is just a wall.

906
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,940
He is transcendent human.

907
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,260
He is so beefy.

908
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,180
Why did they make him an actual tank?

909
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,700
He is so massive.

910
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,340
It's what I see.

911
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:29,060
There is one thing that makes me think that there is something different about Snake.

912
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,100
And I think this is it.

913
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,260
I think that they just made him like...

914
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,640
I mean, he has to eat those bullets somehow.

915
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,800
But goddammit!

916
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,840
He is extra solid.

917
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,380
No!

918
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,060
Snake!

919
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,120
Oh gosh, everybody just looks so good.

920
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,460
Break boss.

921
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,340
It's true!

922
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,120
Oh gosh.

923
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,420
I see literally every pore.

924
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,100
The fear.

925
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,240
That's my one fear.

926
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,780
Can you see inside the fairies?

927
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,460
Oh yeah, you can.

928
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,380
You can see him.

929
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,500
Oh my gosh.

930
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,620
He looks so good.

931
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,420
He has the thighs of evergreen tree trunks.

932
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,520
That's what I'm saying!

933
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,360
He is beefier than the boss.

934
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,580
He is a beef boss.

935
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,540
Wow, he looks so cool.

936
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,680
Oh my gosh.

937
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,400
Sorry, I know I'm watching it again.

938
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:04,760
Snake!

939
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,370
Wait, it won't let me zoom in.

940
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:16,950
No!

941
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:27,450
Oh my gosh, this is the face that I was telling you guys about earlier.

942
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,350
He makes such a silly face.

943
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:30,890
Well, that was fun though.

944
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:35,570
We still had a good time, I think, watching the state of play together.

945
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,610
Hopefully there is still at least some stuff that you are interested in.

946
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:44,150
And if not, you know, games are always coming out.

947
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,290
Games are always coming out.

948
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:49,430
Bro is flabbergasted.

949
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,730
That's so funny.

950
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,070
Lies of Pea.

951
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,350
That's Onimusha, right?

952
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:05,050
This doesn't look as good though, I'm not going to lie.

953
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:08,670
I think I prefer when they do the stupid paranormal stuff.

954
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:12,890
Endurance watching 50 plus times the trailer.

955
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:16,690
I will know every little millisecond.

956
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:18,410
Thanks for streaming on your day off.

957
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:19,590
Glad you got your delta fix.

958
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,310
Thank you!

959
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,410
Thank you, love to see you.

960
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:28,530
Oh, this is Freddy Fazbear.

961
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:32,110
Hello, where is Freddy Fazbear?

962
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,390
Thank you, Chai Princess.

963
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,730
Secret of the Mimic.

964
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,470
Is that based on one of the books or something?

965
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:42,990
Look at that.

966
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:51,110
Famco edging us on purpose for the Ace Combat 8 announcement.

967
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,950
It's only February.

968
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,990
We have the whole rest of the year for more announcements.

969
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:01,950
Hopefully, right?

970
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,070
Since it's the 30th year anniversary.

971
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:09,610
What's my favorite Metal Gear Solid game?

972
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,830
It's kind of flip-flops between 2 and 3.

973
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,330
Also, Peace Walker.

974
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,630
Basically, those three are on the same level.

975
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:24,010
Rip another year with no Bloodborne 2.

976
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,090
I'm sorry.

977
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,290
Let's see what else we got.

978
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,730
Oh yeah, It Takes Two Riders.

979
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,330
I'm so confused about what's going on in this game.

980
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,210
And then we got WWE Island.

981
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:46,310
Do I sound like I'm coping?

982
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,310
Do I sound like I'm coping right now?

983
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,350
What was this one?

984
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:56,610
Oh yeah, Sonic, right?

985
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,530
Oh my eyes.

986
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:03,190
Oh my god, every screenshot is literally illegible.

987
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,770
Except this one.

988
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,530
Wait, are those little ghosts?

989
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,410
Look at those guys.

990
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:12,050
I'm going to like them.

991
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,870
I cross worlds.

992
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:17,910
Oh see, this is the closest we'll get to Ace Combat.

993
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,990
I'm sorry everybody.

994
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:22,550
It's cool to be a Sonic fan.

995
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:26,710
Have you played the original Metal Gear on NES?

996
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:27,390
I have.

997
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:31,570
I've played all the games, but...

998
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,680
Snake's Revenge, and Survivor...

999
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:36,660
Survivor...

1000
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:40,390
Survive and Acid.

1001
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:45,850
Did I miss the Lifeline 2 announcement?

1002
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,430
Survivor.

1003
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:53,810
Look at this skinny bean over here.

1004
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:56,330
This guy is literally phasing out of existence.

1005
01:07:57,390 --> 01:07:58,210
Let's get him some food.

1006
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:00,450
They don't feed them on the base apparently.

1007
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:01,830
Who is that?

1008
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,020
Help him.

1009
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,340
He barely made it into the video.

1010
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,700
Oh yeah, we had the new... I guess...

1011
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:24,040
I feel like the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer didn't need to be as long as it was.

1012
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,780
The game comes out next week.

1013
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:31,680
Have you tried the Sonic Racing games?

1014
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,880
This is like the fourth title in the series.

1015
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,920
Actually, I haven't.

1016
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:41,040
The only Sonic games that I've really played were the ones for...

1017
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,680
Like the older ones.

1018
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:43,680
Oh my gosh.

1019
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,700
I had it on my Sega Nomad.

1020
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,840
Oh, I think we're behind some... Wait.

1021
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,180
Unless it's a... Oh wait.

1022
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,940
Imagine the cake that unit has.

1023
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:04,560
I know.

1024
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,020
The Sonic Ghosts are called Wisps actually?

1025
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,100
No way!

1026
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:08,680
Seriously?

1027
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,460
You had a Nomad?

1028
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,420
Well, it was my sister's Nomad and it was given to me, so yeah.

1029
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,880
Technically, I had a Nomad.

1030
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:25,140
But it was my sister's and then passed down to me.

1031
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1032
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,240
Anyway, this was fun.

1033
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,380
Thank you guys.

1034
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,160
What was this?

1035
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,220
That elephant though.

1036
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,700
The new Freddy Fazbear is going to be so funny.

1037
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,380
Okay, I hope you guys had fun.

1038
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:51,080
Thank you guys and I'll see you later.

1039
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,500
Bye bye!

1040
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,080
Otsuminto, have a good rest of your day.

1041
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,740
Thanks for watching with me.

1042
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,440
Thanks for letting me freak out over Metal Gear.

1043
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,380
Bye bye!

1044
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:10,990
Actually, I want to say.

1045
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:13,510
I'm kind of annoyed that they then put the...

1046
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:21,550
They couldn't wait like 3 days to do the trailer for Metal Gear and put it on the store then?

1047
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,570
Why did I have to get spoiled?

1048
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:26,990
You know what?

1049
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,110
Now I'm kind of annoyed.

1050
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:34,370
I could have seen that trailer for the first time today.

1051
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:39,270
And instead, they put it on the store early.

1052
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,150
Digimon also leaked?

1053
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:41,890
No way!

1054
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,810
That's so annoying.

1055
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:50,150
Hey, PlayStation Store!

1056
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:54,970
Anyway, okay bye!
